THE MAN WHO CAME BACK 

He returned from the fathomless depths 
of space to reclaim his lost love— and 
they lived happily ever after . 

Naturally, there was a tre- 
mendous fuss made over him, 
since he was the first man actually 
to buy up his indenture and return 
from a colony- world. He had been 
away eighteen years, farming on 
bleak Novotny IX, and who knew 
how many of those years he had 
been slaving and saving to win his 
passage home? 

Besides, rumor had it that a girl 
was involved. It could be the big 
romance of the century, maybe. 
Even before the ship carrying him 
had docked at Long Island Space- 
port, John Burkhardt was a system- 
famed celebrity. Word of his return 
had preceded him — word, and all 
manner of rumor, legend and 
myth. 

The starship Lincoln, returning 
from a colony-seeding trip in the 
outer reaches of the galaxy, for the 
first time in its history, was carry- 
ing an Earthward-bound passenger. 
A small army of newsmen im- 
patiently awaited the ship’s land- 
ing, and the nine worlds waited 
with them. 

When he stepped into the un- 
loading elevator and made his 
descent, a hum of comment rippled 
through the gathered crowd. Burk- 
hardt looked his part perfectly. He 
was a tall man, spare and lean. His 
face was solemn, his lips thin and 
pale, his hair going gray though he 
was only in his forties. And his 
eyes — deepset, glowering, com- 
manding. Everything fit the myth: 
the physique, the face, the eyes. 
They were those of a man who 
could renounce Earth for unre- 
quited love, then toil eighteen years 
out of the sheer strength of that 
love. 

Cameras ground. Bulbs flashed. 
Five hundred reporters felt their 
tongues going dry with anticipation 
of the big story. 

Burkhardt smiled coldly and 
waved at the horde of newsmen. He 
did not blink, shield his eyes, or 
turn away. He seemed almost un- 
naturally in control of himself. 
They had expected him to weep, 
maybe kneel and kiss the soil of 
Mother Earth. He did none of those 
things. He merely smiled and 
waved. 

The Global Wire man stepped 
forward. He had won the lottery. It 
was his privilege to conduct the first 
interview. 

“Welcome to Earth, Mr. Burk- 
hardt. How does it feel to be 
back?” 

“I’m glad to be here.” Burk- 
hardt’s voice was slow, deep, 
measured, controlled like every 
other aspect of him. 

‘‘This army of pressmen doesn’t 
upset you, does it?” 

“I haven't seen this many people 
all at once in eighteen years. But 
no — they don’t upset me.” 

“You know, Mr. Burkhardt, 
you’ve done something special. 
You’re the only man ever to return 
to Earth after signing out on an in- 
denture.” 

“Am I the only one?” Burkhardt 
responded easily. “1 wasn’t aware 
of that.” 

"You are indeed, sir. And I’d 
like to know, if I may — for the 
benefit of billions of viewers — if you 
care to tell us a little of the story 
behind your story? Why did you 
leave Earth in the first place, Mr. 
Burkhardt? And why did you de- 
cide to return?” 

Burkhardt smiled gravely. 
“There was a woman,” he said. “A 
lovely woman, a famous woman 
now. We loved each other, once, 
and when she stopped loving me I 
left Earth. I have reason to believe I 
can regain her love now, so I have 
returned. And now, if you’ll pardon 
me — ” 

“Couldn’t you give us any 
details?” 

“I’ve had a long trip, and I pre- 
fer to rest now. I’ll be glad to 
answer your questions at a formal 
press conference tomorrow after- 
noon.” 

And he cut through the crowd 
toward a waiting cab supplied by 
the Colonization Bureau. 

N early everyone in the system 
had seen the brief interview or 
had heard reports of it. It had cer- 
tainly been a masterly job. If people 
had been curious about Burkhardt 
before, they were obsessed with him 
now. To give up Earth out of un- 
requited love, to labor eighteen 
years for a second chance — why, he 
was like some figure out of Dumas, 
brought to life in the middle of the 
24th Century. 

It was no mean feat to buy one’s 
self back out of a colonization in- 
denture, either. The Colonization 
Bureau of the Solar Federation 
undertook to transport potential 
colonists to distant worlds and set 
them up as homesteaders. In return 
for one-way transportation, tools 
and land, the colonists merely had 
to promise to remain settled, to 
marry, and to raise the maximum 
practical number of children. This 
program, a hundred years old now, 
had resulted in the seeding of 
Terran colonies over a galactic 
radius of better than five hundred 
light-years. 

It was theoretically possible for a 
colonist to return to Earth, of 
course. But few of them seemed to 
want to, and none before Burk- 
hardt ever had. To return, you had 
first to pay off your debt to the 
government — figured theoretically 
at $20,000 for round-trip passage, 
$5000 for land, $5000 for tools — 
plus 6% interest per year. Since no- 
body with any assets would ever be- 
come a colonist, and since it was 
next to impossible for a colonist, 
farming an unworked world, to ac- 
cumulate any capital, no case of an 
attempted buy-out had ever arisen. 

Until Burkhardt. He had done it, 
working round the clock, outpro- 
ducing his neighbors on Novotny 
IX and selling them his surplus, 
cabling his extra pennies back to 
Earth to be invested in blue-chip 
securities, and finally — after eigh- 
teen years — amassing the S 30, OOO- 
plus-accrued -interest that would 
spring him from indenture. 

Twenty billion people on nine 
worlds wanted to know why. 

The day after his return, he held 
a press conference in the hotel suite 
provided for him by the Coloniza- 
tion Bureau. Admission was strictly 
limited — one man from each of the 
twenty leading news services, no 
more. 

Wearing a faded purplish tunic 
and battered sandals, Burkhardt 
came out to greet the reporters. He 
looked tremendously dignified — an 
overbearing figure of a man, thin 
but solid, with enormous gnarled 
hands and powerful forearms. The 
gray in his hair gave him a patriar- 
chical look on a world dedicated to 
cosmetic rejuvenation. And his 
eyes, shining like twin beacons, 
roved around the room, transfixing 
everyone once, causing discomfort 
and uneasiness. No one had seen 
eyes like that on a human being be- 
fore. But no one had ever seen a re- 
turned colonist before, either. 

He smiled without warmth. 
“Very well, gentlemen. I’m at your 
disposal.” 

They started with the peripheral 
questions first. 

“What sort of planet is Novotny 
IX, Mr. Burkhardt?” 

"Cold. The temperature never 
gets above sixty. The soil is margi- 
nally fertile. A man has to work 
ceaselessly if he wants to stay alive 
there." 

“Did you know that when you 
signed up to go there?" 

Burkhardt nodded. “I asked fort 
the least desirable of the available 
colony worlds.” 

“Are there many colonists 
there?” 

“About twenty thousand, I 
think. It isn’t a popular planet, you 
understand.” 

"Mr. Burkhardt, part of the 
terms of the colonist’s indenture 
specify that me must marry. Did 
you fulfill this part of the 
contract?” 

Burkhardt smiled sadly. “I 
married less than a week after my 
arrival there in 2319. My wife died 
the first winter of our marriage. 
There were no children. I didn’t 
remarry.” 

“And when did you get the idea 
of buying up your indenture and re- 
turning to Earth?” 

“In my third year on Novotny 
IX." 

“In other words, you devoted 
fifteen years to getting back to 
Earth?” 

“That’s correct.” 

It was a young reporter from 
Transuniverse News who took the 
plunge toward the real meat of the 
universe. “Could you tell us why 
you changed your mind about re- 
maining a colonist? At the space- 
port you said something about 
there being a woman — ” 

“Yes.” Burkhardt chuckled 
mirthlessly. “I was pretty young 
when I threw myself into the coloni- 
zation plan — twenty-five, in point 
of fact. There was a woman; I loved 
her; she married someone else. I 
did the romantic thing and signed 
up for Novotny IX. Three years 
later, the newstap from Earth told 
me that she had been divorced. 
This was in 2322. I resolved to 
return to Earth and try to persuade 
her to marry me.” 

“So for fifteen years you 
struggled to get back so you could 
patch up your old romance," an- 
other newsman said. “But how did 
you know she hadn’t remarried in 
all that time?” 

“She did remarry,” Burkhardt 
said stunningly. 

“But — ” 

“I received word of her remar- 
riage in 2324, and of her subse- 
quent divorce in 2325. Of her re- 
marriage in 2327, and of her subse- 
quent divorce in 2329. Of her re- 
marriage in the same year, and her 
subsequent divorce in 2334. Of her 
remarriage in 2335, and of her di- 
vorce four months ago. Unless I 
have missed the announcement, 
she has not remarried this last 
time.” 

"Did you abandon your project 
every time you heard of one of these 
marriages?” 

Burkhardt shook his head. “I 
kept on saving. I was confident that 
none of her marriages would last. 
All these years, you see, she’s been 
trying to find a substitute for me. 
But human beings are unique. 
There are no substitutes. I weather- 
ed five of her marriages. Her sixth 
husband will be myself.” 

“Could you tell us — could you 
tell us the name of this woman, Mr. 
Burkhardt?” 

The returned colonist’s smile was 
frigid. “I'm not ready to reveal her 
name just yet,” he said. “Are there 
any further questions?” 

along toward mid-afternoon, 
Burkhardt ended the confer- 
ence. He had told them in detail of 
his efforts to pile up the money; he 
had talked about life as a colonist; 
he had done everything but tell 
them the name of the woman for 
whose sake he had done all this. 

Alone in the suite after they had 
gone, Burkhardt stared out at the 
other glittering towers of New 
York. Jet liners droned overhead; a 
billion lights shattered the dark- 
ness. New York, he thought, was as 
chaotic and as repugnant to him as 
ever. He missed Novotny IX. 

But he had had to come back. 
Smiling gently, he opaqued the 
windows of his suite. It was winter, 
now, on Novotny IX 's colonized 
continent. A time for burrowing 
away, for digging in against the 
mountain-high drifts of blue-white 
snow. Winter was eight standard 
months long, on Novotny IX; only 
four out of the sixteen standard 
months of the planet’s year were 
really livable. Yet a man could see 
the results of his own labor, out 
there. He could use his hands and 
measure his gains. 

And there were friends there. 
Not the other settlers, though they 
were good people and hard 
workers. But the natives, the 
Euranoi. 

The survey charts said nothing 
about them. There were only about 
live hundred of them left, anyway, 
or so Donnoi had claimed. Burk- 
hardt had never seen more than a 
dozen of the Euranoi at any one 
time, and he had never been able to 
tell one from another. They looked 
like slim elves, half the height of a 
man, gray-skinned, chinless, sad- 
eyed. They went naked against 
their planet’s bitter cold. They lived 
in caves, somewhere below the sur- 
face. And Donnoi had become 
Burkhardt’s friend. 

Burkhardt smiled, remember- 
ing. He had found the little alien in 
a snowdrift, so close to dead it was 
hard to be certain one way or the 
other. Donnoi had lived, and had 
recovered, and had spent the winter 
in Burkhardt’s cabin, talking a 
little, but mostly listening. 

Burkhardt had done the talking. 
He had talked it all out, telling the 
little being of his foolishness, of his 
delusion that Lily loved him, of his 
wild maniac desire to get back to 
Earth. 

And Donnoi had said, when he 
understood the situation, “You will 
get back to Earth. And she will be 
yours. " 

That had been between the first 
divorce and the second marriage. 
The day ’the newstapes had brought 
word of Lily’s remarriage had 
nearly finished Burkhardt, but 
Donnoi was there, comforting, con- 
soling. and from that day on Burk- 
hardt never worried again. Lily’s 
marriages were made, weakened, 
broke up, and Burkhardt worked 
unfalteringly, knowing that when 
he returned to Earth he could have 
Lily at last. 

Donnoi had told him solemnly, 
"It is all a matter of channelling 
you r desires. Look: l lay dying in a 
snowdrift, and I willed you to find 
me. You came: l lived. " 

“But I’m not Euranoi,” Burk- 
hardt had protested. “My will isn’t 
strong enough to influence another 
person.” 

“Any creature that thinks can 
assert its will. Give me your hand, 
and / will show you. ” 

Burkhardt smiled back across 
fifteen years, remembering the feel 
of Donnoi’s limp, almost boneless 
hand in his own, remembering the 
stiff jolt of power that had flowed 
from the alien. His hand had 
tingled for days afterward. But he 
knew, from that moment, that he 
would succeed. 

B urkhardt had a visitor the 
next morning. A press confer- 
ence was scheduled again for the 
afternoon, and Burkhardt had said 
he would grant no interviews before 
then, but the visitor had been insis- 
tent. Finally, the desk had phoned 
up to tell Burkhardt that a Mr. 
Richardson Elliott was here, and 
demanded to see him. 

The name rang a bell. “Send him 
up,” Burkhardt said. 

A few minutes later, the elevator 
disgorged Mr. Richardson Elliott. 
He was shorter than Burkhardt, 
plump, pink-skinned, clean- 
shaven. A ring glistened on his 
finger, and there was a gem of some 
alien origin mounted on a stickpin 
near his throat. 

He extended his hand. Burk- 
hardt took it. The hand was care- 
fully manicured, pudgy, somehow 
oily. 

“You’re not at all as I pictured 
you.” Burkhardt said. 

“You are. Exactly.” 

“Why did you come here?” 
Elliott tapped the newsfax 
crumpled under his arm. He 
unfolded it, showing Burkhardt the 
front-page spread. “I read the 
story, Burkhardt. I knew at once 
who the girl — the woman — was. I 
came to warn you not to get in-
volved with her.” 

Burkhardt’s eyes twinkled. “And 
why not?” 

“She’s a witch,” Elliott mutter- 
ed. “She’ll drain a man dry and 
throw the husk away. Believe me, 1 
know. You only loved her. I 
married her.” 

“Yes,” Burkhardt said. “You 
took her away from me eighteen 
years ago.” 

“You know that isn’t true. She 
walked out on you because she 
thought I could further her career, 
which was so. 1 didn't even know 
another man had been in the 
picture until she got that letter 
from you, postmarked the day your 
ship took off. She showed it to 
me — laughing. 1 can’t repeat the 
things she said about you, Burk- 
hardt. But I was shocked. My mar- 
riage to her started to come apart 
right then and there, even though it 
was another three years before we 
called it quits. She threw herself at 
me. I didn’t steal her from any- 
body. Believe me, Burkhardt.” 

“1 believe you.” 

Elliott mopped his pink fore- 
head. “It was the same way with all 
the other husbands. I’ve followed 
her career all along. She exists only 
for Lily Leigh, and nobody else. 
When she left me, it was to marry 
Alderson. Well, she killed him as 
good as if she’d shot him, when she 
told him she was pulling out. Man 
his age had no business marrying 
her. And then it was Michaels, and 
after him Dan Cartwright, and 
then Jim Thorne. Right up the 
ladder to fame and fortune, leaving 
a trail of used-up husbands behind 
her." 

Burkhardt shrugged. “The past 
is of no concern to me.” 

“You actually think Lily will 
marry you?" 

“1 do," Burkhardt said. “She’ll 
jump at it. The publicity values will 
be irresistible. The sollie star with 
five broken marriages to million- 
aires now stooping to wed her 
youthful love, who is now a penni- 
less ex-colonist.” 

Elliott moistened his lips unhap- 
pily. “Perhaps you’ve got some- 
thing there," he admitted. “Lily 
might just do a thing like that. But 
how long would it last? Six months, 
a year — until the publicity dies 
down. And then she’ll dump you. 
She doesn’t want a penniless 
husband.” 

“She won’t dump me.” 

"You sound pretty confident, 
Burkhardt.” 

“I am.” 

For a moment there was silence. 
Then Elliott said, “You seem deter- 
mined to stick your head in the 
lion’s mouth. What is it — an ob- 
session to marry her?” 

“Call it that.” 

“It’s crazy. I tell you, she’s a 
witch. You’re in love with an imagi- 
nary goddess. The real Lily Leigh is 
the most loathsome female ever 
spawned. As the first of her five 
husbands, 1 can take oath to that.” 
“Did you come here just to tell 
me that?” 

“Not exactly," Elliott said. “I’ve 
got a proposition for you. I want 
you to come into my firm as a Vice 
President. You’re system-famous, 
and we can use the publicity. I’ll 
start you at sixty thousand. You’ll 
be the most eligible bachelor in the 
universe. We’ll get you a rejuvena- 
tion and you’ll look twenty-five 
again. Only none of this Lily Leigh 
nonsense. I'll set you up, you’ll 
marry some good-looking kid, and 
all your years on Whatsis Nine will 
be just so much nightmare." 

“The answer is no.” 

“I’m not doing this out of 
charity, you understand. I think 
you’ll be an asset to me. But I also 
think you ought to be protected 
against Lily. I feel I owe you some- 
thing, for what I did to you un- 
knowingly eighteen years ago.” 
“You don’t owe me a thing. 
Thanks for the warning, Mr. 
Elliott, but I don’t need it. And the 
answer to the proposition is No. I’m 
not for sale.” 

“1 beg you — ” 

“No.” 

Color flared in Elliott’s cheeks 
for a moment. He rose, started to 
say something, stopped. “All 
right,” he said heavily. “Go to Lily. 
Like a moth drawn to a flame. The 
offer remains, Mr. Burkhardt. And 
you have my deepest sympathy.” 

at his press conference that after- 
noon, Burkhardt revealed her 
name. The system’s interest was at 
peak, now; another day without the 
revelation and the peak would pass, 
frustration would cause interest to 
subside. Burkhardt told them. 
Within an hour it was all over the 
system. 

Glamorous Lily Leigh, for a de- 
cade and a half queen of the solido- 
Jilms, was named today as the 
woman for whom John Burkhardt 
bought himself out of indenture. 
Burkhardt explained that Miss 
Leigh, then an unknown starlet, 
terminated their engagement in 
2319 to marry California industria- 
list Richardson Elliott. The 
n'Hirriage, like Miss Leigh's four 
later ones, ended in divorce. 

"I hope now to make her my 
wife , " the mystery man from 
Novotny IX declared. “ After 
eighteen years I still love her as 
strongly as ever. " 

Miss Leigh, in seclusion at her 
Scottsdale. Arizona home following 
her recent divorce from sollie-dis- 
tributing magnate James Thorne, 
refused to comment on the state- 
ment. 

For three days. Lily Leigh re- 
mained in seclusion, seeing no one, 
issuing no statements to the press. 
Burkhardt was patient. Eighteen 
years of waiting teaches patience. 
And Donnoi had told him, as they 
trudged through the gray slush of 
rising spring, “ The man who 
rushes ahead foolishly forfeits all 
advantages in a contest of wills. ” 

Donnoi carried the wisdom of a 
race at the end of its span. Burk-
hardt remained in his hotel suite, 
mulling over the advice of the little 
alien. Donnoi had never passed 
judgment on the merits and draw- 
backs of Burkhardt’ s goal; he had 
simply advised, and suggested, and 
taught. 

The press had run out of things 
to say about Burkhardt. and he de- 
clined to supply them with anything 
new to print. So, inevitably, they 
lost interest in him. By the third 
day, it was no longer necessary to 
hold a press conference. He had 
come back; he had revealed his love 
for the sollie queen, Lily Leigh; now 
he was sitting tight. There was 
nothing to do but wait for further 
developments, if any. And neither 
Burkhardt nor Lily Leigh seemed to 
be creating further developments. 

It was hard to remain calm, 
Burkhardt thought. It was queer to 
be here on Earth, in the quiet 
autumn, w hile winter fury raged on 
Novotny IX. Fury of a different 
kind raged here, the fury of a world 
of five billion eager, active human 
beings, but Burkhardt kept himself 
aloof from all that. Eighteen years 
of near-solitude had left him unfit 
for that sort of world. 

It was hard to sit quietly, though, 
w ith Lily just a visicall away. Burk- 
hardt compelled himself to be 
patient. She would call, sooner or 
later. 

She called on the fourth day. 
Burkhardt’s skin crawled as he 
heard the hotel operator say — in 
tones regulated only with enormous 
effort — “Miss Leigh is calling from 
Arizona, Mr. Burkhardt," 

“Put the call on." 

She had not used the visi-circuit. 
Burkhardt kept his screen blank 
too. 

She said, withdut preliminaries, 
"Why have you come back after all 
these years, John?” 

“Because 1 love you." 

"Still?" 

“Yes." 

She laughed — the famous LL 
laugh, for his benefit alone. 
"You’re a bigger fool now than you 
were then, John.” 

“Perhaps.” he admitted. 

"1 suppose I ought to thank you, 
though. This is the best publicity 
I've had all year. And at my age I 
need all the publicity 1 can get." 

"I'm glad for you," he said. 

"You aren’t serious, though, 
about wanting to marry me, are 
you? Not after all these years. No- 
body stays in love that long.” 

"I did." 

“Damn you, what do you want 
from me?” The voice, suddenly 
shrill, betrayed a whisper of age. 

“Yourself.” Burkhardt said 
calmly. 

“What makes you think I’ll 
marry you? Sure, you’re a hero to- 
day. The Man Who Came Back 
From The Stars. But you’re 
nothing, John. All you have to show 
for eighteen years is callouses. At 
least back then you had your youth. 
You don’t even have that any 
more.” 

“Let me come to see you. Lily.” 
“1 don’t want to see you.” 
“Please. It’s a small thing — let 
me have half an hour alone with 
you." 

She was silent. 

"I've given you half a lifetime of 
love. L.ily. Let me have half an 
hour." 

After a long moment she said, 
simply, hoarsely, "All right. You 
can come. But I won’t marry you.” 

H e left New York shortly be- 
fore midnight. The Coloniza- 
tion Bureau had hired a private 
plane for him, and he slipped out 
unnoticed, in the dark. Publicity 
now would be fatal. The plane was 
a chemically powered jet, some- 
what out of date; they were using 
photon-rockets for the really fast 
travel. But. obsolete or no, it 
crossed the continent in three 
hours. It was just midnight, local 
time, when the plane landed in 
Phoenix. As they had arranged it, 
Lily had her chauffeur waiting, 
with a long, sleek limousine. Burk- 
hardt climbed in. Turbines 
throbbed; the car glided out toward 
Lily’s desert home. 

It was a mansion, a sprawled- 
out villa moated off — a moat, in 
water-hungry Arizona! — and topp- 
ed with a spiring pink stucco tower. 
Burkhardt was ushered through 
open fern-lined courtyards to an 
inner maze of hallways, and 
through them into a small room 
where Lily Leigh sat waiting. 

He repressed a gasp. She wore a 
gown worth a planet’s ransom, but 
the girl within the gown had not 
changed in eighteen years. Her face 
was the same, impish, the eyes 
dancing and gay. Her hair had lost 
none of its glossy sheen. Her skin 
was the skin of a girl of nineteen. 

"It’s like stepping back in time,” 
he murmured. 

"I have good doctors. You 
wouldn’t believe I'm forty, would 
you? But everyone knows it, of 
course.” She laughed. “You look 
like an old man, John.” 
"Forty-three isn’t old.” 

"It is when you let your age 
show. I’ll give you some money, 
John, and you can get fixed up. 
Better still. I’ll send my doctors to 
you." 

Burkhardt shook his head. “I’m 
honest about the passing of time. 1 
look this way because of what I’ve 
done these past eighteen years. 

I wouldn’t want a doctor’s skill to 
w ipe out the traces of those years." 

She shrugged lightly. “It was 
only an offer, not a slur. What do 
you want with me, John?” 

“I want you to marry me.” 

Her laughter was a silvery tinkle, 
ultimately striking a false note. 
“That made sense in 2319. It 
doesn't now. People would say you 
married me for my money. I’ve got 
lots of money, John, you know.” 
“I’m not interested in your 
money. I want you.” 

“You think you love me, but how 
can you? I’m not the sweet little girl 
you once loved. 1 never was that 
sweet iittle girl. I was a grasping, 
greedy little girl — and now I'm a 
grasping, greedy old woman who 
still looks like a little girl. Go away, 
John. I'm not for you.” 

"Marry me, Lily. We’ll be 
happy. I know we will.” 

“You're a stupid monomaniac.” 
Burkhardt only smiled. “It’ll be 
good publicity. After five marriages 
for profit, you’re marrying for love. 
All the worlds love a lover, Lily. 
You’ll be everyone’s sweetheart 
again. Give me your hand, Lily.” 
Like a sleepwalker, she extended 
it. Burkhardt took the hand, 
frowning at its coldness, its limp- 
ness. 

“But 1 don’t love you, John.” 
"Let the world think you do. 
That’s all that matters.” 

“1 don’t understand you. 
You — ” 

She stopped. Burkhardt’s grip 
tightened on her thin hand. He 
thought of Donnoi, a gray shadow' 
against the snow, holding his hand, 
letting the power flow from body to 
body, from slim alien to tall Earth- 
man. It is all a matter of channel- 
ling your desires, he had said. Any 
creature that thinks can learn how 
to assert its will. The technique is 
simple. 

Lily lowered her head. After a 
moment, she raised it. She was 
smiling. 

It won’t last a month," Rich- 
Jardson Elliott grunted, at the 
sight of the announcement in the 
paper. 

“The poor dumb bastard," Jim 
Thorne said, reading the news at 
his Martian ranch. “Falling in love 
with a dream-Lily that never 
existed, and'actually marrying her. 
She'll suck him dry.” 

On nine worlds, people read the 
story and talked about it. Many of 
them were pleased; it was the 
proper finish for the storybook 
courtship. But those who knew Lily 
L.eigh were less happy about it. 
“She's got some angle,” they said. 
"It's all a publicity stunt. She’ll 
drop hint as soon as the fanfare dies 
down. And she’ll drop him so hard 
lie won't ever get up.” 

Burkhardtand Lily were married 
on the tenth day after his return 
from space. It was a civil ceremony, 
held secretly. Their honeymoon trip 
was shrouded in mystery. While 
they were gone, gossip columnists 
speculated. How' could the brittle, 
sophisticated, much-married Lily 
be happy with a simple farmer from 
a colony-world? 

Two days after their return to 
Earth from the honeymoon. Burk- 
hardt and his wife held a joint press 
conference. It lasted only five 
minutes. Burkhardt, holding his 
wjfe’s hand tightly, said, “I’m 
happy to announce that Miss Leigh 
is distributing all of her possessions 
to charity. We’ve both signed up as 
indentured colonists and we’re 
leaving for Novotny IX tomorrow,” 

“Really, Miss Leigh?” 

“Yes.” Lily said. "1 belong at 
John’s side. We’ll work his old farm 
together. It’ll be the first useful 
thing I’ve ever done in my life.” 

The newsmen, thunderstruck, 
scattered to shout their story to the 
waiting worlds. Mr. and Mrs. John 
Burkhardt closed the door behind 
them. 

“Happy?” Burkhardt asked. 

Lily nodded. She was still smil- 
ing. Burkhardt, watching her 
closely, saw the momentary flicker 
ot her eyes, the brief clearing-away 
of the cloud that shrouded them — 
as though someone were trapped 
behind those lovely eyes, struggling 
to get out. But Burkhardt’s control 
never lapsed. Bending, he kissed 
her soft lips lightly. 

"Bedtime,” he said. 

“Yes. Bedtime." 

Burkhardt kissed her again. 
Donnoi had been right, he thought. 
Control was possible. He had 
channelled desire eighteen years, 
and now Lily was his. Perhaps she 
was no longer Lily as men had 
known her, but what did that 
matter? She was the Lily of his 
lonely dreams. He had created her 
in the tingling moment of a hand- 
shake, from the raw material of her 
old self. 

He turned off the light and began 
to undress. He thought w r ith cozy 
pleasure that in only a few weeks he 
would be setting foot once again on 
the bleak tundra of Novotny 
IX — this time, with his loving 
bride. *
