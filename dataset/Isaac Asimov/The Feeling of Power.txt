Graphitics was a startlingly new idea! 

So revolutionary, in fact , it rocked the top army brass . 

Imagine computing — without a computer! 

EHAN SHUMAN WAS used to 
dealing with the men in author- 
ity on long-embattled Earth. He 
was only a civilian but he originated 
programming patterns that resulted 
in self-directing war computers of 
the highest sort. Generals conse- 
quently listened to him. Heads of 
congressional committees, too. 

There was one of each in the 
special lounge of New Pentagon. 
General Weider was space-burnt 
and had a small mouth puckered 
almost into a cypher. Congressman 
Brant was smooth-cheeked and 
clear-eyed. He smoked Denebian 
tobacco with the air of one whose 
patriotism was so notorious, he 
could be allowed such liberties. 

Shuman, tall, distinguished and 
programmer-first-class, faced them 
fearlessly. 

He said, “This, gentlemen, is 
Ladislas Aub.” 

“The one with the unusual gift 
that you discovered quite by acci- 
dent,” said Congressman Brant, 
placidly. “Ah.” He inspected the 
little man with the egg-bald head 
with amiable curiosity. 

The little man, in return, twisted 
the fingers of his hands anxiously. 
He had never been near such great 
men before. He was only an aging 
low-grade Technician who had long 
ago failed all tests designed to 
smoke out the gifted ones among 
mankind and had settled into the 
rut of unskilled labor. There was 
just this hobby of his that the great 
programmer had found out about 
and was now making such a fright- 
ening fuss over. 

General Weider said, “I find this 
atmosphere of mystery childish.” 
“You won’t in a moment,” said 
Shuman. “This is not something we 
can leak to the first-comer. — Aub!” 
There was something imperative 
about his manner of biting off that 
one-syllable name, but then he was 
a great Programmer speaking to a 
mere Technician. “Aub! How 
much is nine times seven?” 

Aub hesitated a moment, his 
pale eyes glimmered with a feeble 
anxiety. “Sixty-three,” he said. 

Congressman Brant lifted his 
eyebrows. “Is that right?” 

“Check it for yourself, congress- 
man.” 

The congressman took out his 
pocket computer, nudged the 
milled edges twice, looked at its face 
as it lay there in the palm of his 
hand and put it back. He said, “Is 
this the gift you brought us here to 
demonstrate. An illusionist?” 

“More than that, sir. Aub has 
memorized a few operations and 
with them he computes on paper.” 
“A paper computer?” said the 
general. He looked pained. 

“No, sir,” said Shuman, patient- 
ly. “Not a paper computer. Simply 
a sheet of paper. General, would 
you be so kind as to suggest a num- 
ber?” 

“Seventeen,” said the general. 
“And you, congressman?” 
“Twenty-three.” 

“Good! Aub, multiply those 
numbers and please show the gen- 
tlemen your manner of doing it.” 
“Yes, programmer,” said Aub, 

ducking his head. He fished a small 
pad out of one shirt pocket and an 
artist’s hairline stylus out the 
other.” His forehead corrugated as 
he made painstaking marks on the 
paper. 

General Weider interrupted him 
sharply. “Let’s see that.” 

Aub passed him the paper, and 
Weider said, “Well, it looks like the 
figure seventeen.” 

Congressman Brant nodded and 
said, “So it does, but I suppose any- 
one can copy figures off a computer. 
I think I could make a passable 
seventeen myself, even without 
practice.” 

“If you will let Aub continue, 
gentlemen,” said Shuman without 
heat. 

Aub continued, his hand trem- 
bling a little. Finally, he said in a 
low voice, “The answer is three 
hundred and ninety-one.” 

Congressman Brant took out his 
computer a second time and flicked 
it, “By Godfrey, so it is. How did 
he guess?” 

“No guess, congressman,” said 
Shuman. “He computed that result. 
He did it on this sheet of paper.” 
“Humbug,” said the general, im- 
patiently. “A computer is one thing 
and marks on paper are another.” 
“Explain, Aub,” said Shuman. 
“Yes, programmer. — Well, gen- 
tlemen, I write down seventeen and 
just underneath it, I write twenty- 
three. Next, I say to myself: seven 
times three — ” 

The congressman interrupted 
smoothly, “Now, Aub, the problem 
is seventeen times twenty-three.” 
“Yes, I know,” said the little 
technician earnestly, “but I start by 
saying seven times three because 
that’s the way it works. Now seven 
times three is twenty-one.” 

“And how do you know that?” 
asked the congressman. 

“I just remember it. It’s always 
twenty-one on the computer. I’ve 
checked it any number of times.” 
“That doesn’t mean it always 
will be, though, does it?” said the 
congressman. 

“Maybe not,” stammered Aub. 
“I’m not a mathematician. But I 
always get the right answers, you 
see.” 

“ G ° on.” 

“Seven times three is twenty-one, 
so I write down twenty-one. Then 
one times three is three, so I write 
down a three under the two of 
twenty-one.” 

“Why under the two?” asked 
Congressman Brant at once. 

“Because — ” Aub looked help- 
lessly at his superior for support. 
“It’s difficult to explain.” 

Shuman said, “If you will accept 
his work for the moment, we can 
leave the details for the mathema- 
ticians.” 

Brant subsided. 

Aub said, “Three plus two makes 
five, you see, so the twenty-one be- 
comes a fifty-one. Now you let that 
go for a while and start fresh. You 
multiply seven and two, that’s four- 
teen, and one and two, that’s two. 
Put them down like this and it adds 
up to thirty-four. Now if you put 
the thirty-four under the fifty-one 
this way and add them, you get 
three hundred and ninety-one and 
that’s the answer.” 

There was an instant’s silence 
and then General Weider said, “I 
don’t believe it. He goes through 
this rigmarole and makes up num- 
bers and multiplies and adds them 
this way and that, but I don’t be- 
lieve it. It’s too complicated to be 
anything but hornswoggling.” 

“Oh, no, sir,” said Aub in a 
sweat. “It only seems complicated 
because you’re not used to it. 
Actually, the rules are quite simple 
and will work for any numbers.” 
“Any numbers, eh?” said the 
general. “Come then.” He took out 
his own computer (a severely-styled 
GI model) and struck it at random. 
Make a five, seven, three, eight on 
the paper. That’s five thousand 
seven hundred and thirty-eight.” 
“Yes, sir,” said Aub, taking a 
new sheet of paper. 

“Now,” (more punching of his 
computer), “seven two three nine. 
Seven thousand two hundred and 
thirty-nine.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“And now multiply those two.” 
“It will take some time,” qua- 
vered Aub. 

“Take the time,” said the gen- 
eral. 

“Go ahead, Aub,” said Shuman, 
crisply. 

Aub set to work, bending low. He 
took another sheet of paper and 
another. The general took out his 
watch finally and stared at it. “Are 
you through with your magic-mak- 
ing, technician?” 

“I’m almost done, sir. Here it 
is, sir. Forty-one million, five hun- 
dred and thirty-seven thousand, 
three hundred and eight- two.” He 
showed the scrawled figures of the 
result. 

General Weider smiled bitterly. 

He pushed the multiplication con- 
tact on his computer and let the 
numbers whirl to a halt. And then 
he stared and said in a surprised 
squeak. “Great Galaxy, the fella’s 
right.” 

The President of the Terrestrial 
Federation had grown haggard in 
office and, in private, he allowed a 
look of settled melancholy to ap- 
pear on his sensitive features. The 
Denebian war, after its early start 
of vast movement and great popu- 
larity, had trickled down into a 
sordid matter of maneuver and 
counter-maneuver, with discontent 
rising steadily on Earth. Possibly, 
it was rising on Deneb, too. 

And now Congressman Brant, 
head of the important Committee 
on Military Appropriations was 
cheerfully and smoothly spending 
his half-hour appointment spouting 
nonsense. 

“Computing without a com- 
puter,” said the president, impa- 
tiently, “is a contradiction in 
terms.” 

“Computing,” said the congress- 
man, “is only a system for handling 
data. A machine might d© it, or 
the human brain might. Let me 
give you an example.” And, using 
the new skills he had learned, he 
worked out sums and products until 
the president, despite himself, grew 
interested. 

“Does this always work?” 

“Every time, Mr. President. It is 
foolproof.” 

“Is it hard to learn?” 

“It took me a week to get the 
real hang of it. I think you could 
do better.” 

“Well,” said the president, con- 
sidering, “it’s an interesting parlor 
game, but what is the use of it?” 

“What is the use of a new-born 
baby, Mr. President? At the mo- 
ment, there is no use, but don’t you 
see that this points the way toward 
liberation from the machine. Con- 
sider, Mr. President,” the congress- 
man rose and his deep voice auto- 
matically took on some of the ca- 
dences he used in public debate, 
“that the Denebian was is a war of 
computer against computer. Their 
computers forge an impenetrable 
shield of counter-missiles against 
our missiles, and ours forge one 
against theirs. If we advance the 
efficiency of our computers, so do 
they theirs, and for five years a 
precarious and profitless balance 
has existed. 

“Now we have in our hands a 
method for going beyond the com- 
puter, leap-frogging it, passing 
through it.- We will combine the 
mechanics of computation with hu- 
man thought ; we will have the 
equivalent of intelligent computers ; 
billions of them. I can’t predict 
what the consequences will be in 
detail but they will be incalculable. 
And if Deneb beats us to the punch, 
they may be catastrophic.” 

The president said, troubled, 
“What would you have me do?” 

“Put the power of the adminis- 
tration behind the establishment of 
a secret project on human computa- 
tion. Call it Project Number, if you 
like. I can vouch for my committee, 
but I will need the administration 
behind me.” 

“But how far can human com- 
putation go?” 

“There is no limit. According to 
Programmer Shuman, who first in- 
troduced me to this discovery — ” 
“I’ve heard of Shuman, of 
course.” 

“Yes. Well, Dr. Shuman tells me 
that in theory there is nothing the 
computer can do that the human 
mind can not do. The computer 
merely takes a finite amount of data 
and performs a finite number of 
operations upon them. The human 
mind can duplicate the process.” 
The president considered that. 
He said, “If Shuman says this, I 
am inclined to believe him, — in 
theory. But, in practice, how can 
anyone know how a computer 
works?” 

Brant laughed genially. “Well, 
Mr. President, I asked the same 
question. It seems that at one time, 
computers were designed directly 
by human beings. Those were sim- 
ple computers of course; this being 
before the time of the rational use 
of computers to design more ad- 
vanced computers had been es- 
tablished.” 

“Yes, yes. Go on.” 

“Technician Aub apparently 
had, as his hobby, the reconstruc- 
tion of some of these ancient de- 
vices and in so doing he studied the 
details of their workings and found 
he could imitate them. The mul- 
tiplication I just performed for you 
is an imitation of the workings of 
a computer.” 

“Amazing!” 

The congressman coughed gen- 
tly, “If I may make another point, 
Mr. President — The further we 
can develop this thing, the more we 
can divert our Federal effort from 
computer production and computer 
maintenance. As the human brain 
takes over, more of our energy can 
be directed into peace-time pursuits 
and the impingement of war on 
the ordinary man will be less. This 
will be most advantageous for the 
party in power, of course.” 

“Ah,” said the president, “I see 
your point. Well, sit down, con- 
gressman, sit down. I want some 
time to think about this. — But 
meanwhile, show me that multipli- 
cation trick again. Let’s see if I 
can’t catch the point of it.” 

P ROGRAMMER SHUMAN 
did not try to hurry matters. 
Loesser was conservative, very con- 
servative, and liked to deal with 
computers as his father and grand- 
father had. Still, he controlled the 
West European computer combine 
and if he could be persuaded to 
join Project Number in full enthu- 
siasm, a great deal would have been 
accomplished. 

But Loesser was holding back. 
He said, “I’m not sure I like the 
idea of relaxing our hold on com- 
puters. The human mind is a capri- 
cious thing. The computer will give 
the same answer to the same prob- 
lem each time. What guarantee 
have we that the human mind will 
do the same?” 

“The human mind, Computer 
Loesser, only manipulates fact$. It 
doesn’t matter whether the human 
mind or a machine does it. They 
are just tools.” 

“Yes, yes. I’ve gone over your 
ingenious demonstration that the 
mind can duplicate the computer 
but it seems to me a little in the 
air. I’ll grant the theory but what 
reason have we for thinking that 
theory can be converted to prac- 
tice?” 

“I think we have reason, sir. 
After all, computers have not al- 
ways existed. The cavemen with 
their triremes, stone axes and rail- 
roads had no computers.” 

“And possibly they did not com- 
pute.” 

“You know better than that. 
Even the building of a railroad or 
a ziggurat called for some comput- 
ing, and that must have been with- 
out computers as we know them.” 
“Do you suggest they computed 
in the fashion you demonstrate?” 
“Probably not. After all, this 
method — we call it ‘graphitics’, by 
the way, from the old European 
word ‘grapho’ meaning ‘to write’ — 
is developed from the computers 
themselves so it cannot have an- 
tedated them. Still, the cavemen 
must have had some method, eh?” 
“Lost arts! If you’re going to 
talk about lost arts — ” 

“No, no. I’m not a lost art enthu- 
siast, though I don’t say there may 
not be some. After all, man was eat- 
ing grain before hydroponics and 
if the primitives ate grain, they 
must have grown them in soil. 
What else could they have done?” 
“I don’t know, but I’ll believe in 
soil-growing when I see someone 
gro^ grain in soil. And I’ll believe 
in making fire by rubbing two 
pieces of flint together when I see 
that, too.” 

Shuman grew placating. “Well, 
let’s stick to graphitics. It’s just 
part of the process of etherealiza- 
tion. Transportation by means of 
bulky contrivances is giving way 
to direct mass-transference. Com- 
munications devices become less 
massive and more efficient con- 
stantly. For that matter, compare 
your pocket computer with the 
massive jobs of a thousand years 
ago. Why not, then, the last step of 
doing away with computers alto- 
gether? Come, sir, Project Number 
is a going concern; progress is al- 
ready headlong. But we want your 
help. If patriotism doesn’t move 
you, consider the intellectual ad- 
venture involved.” 

Loesser said, skeptically, “What 
progress? What can you do beyond 
multiplication? Can you integrate 
a transcendental function?” 

“In time, sir. In time. In the last 
month I have learned to handle di- 
vision. I can determine, and cor- 
rectly, integral quotients and deci- 
mal quotients.” 

“Decipial quotients? To how 
many places?” 

Programmer Shuman tried to 
keep his tone casual. “Any num- 
ber!” 

Loesser’s lower jaw dropped. 
“Without a computer?” 

“Set me a problem?” 

“Divide twenty-seven by thir- 
teen? Take it to six places.” 

Five minutes later, Shuman said, 
“Two point oh seven six nine two 
three.” 

Loesser checked it. “Well, now, 
that’s amazing. Multiplication 
didn’t impress me too much because 
it involved integers after all, and I 
thought trick manipulation might 
do it. But decimals — ” 

“And that is not all. There is a 
new development that is, so far, top 
secret and which, strictly speaking, 
I ought not to mention. Still — 
We may have made a breakthrough 
on the square root front.” 

“Square roots?” 

“It involves some tricky points 
and we haven’t licked the bugs yet, 
but Technician Aub, the man who 
invented the science and who has 
an amazing intuition in connection 
with it, maintains he has the prob- 
lem almost solved. And he is only a 
technician. A man like yourself, a 
trained and talented mathemati- 
cian ought to have no difficulty.” 

“Square roots,” muttered Loes- 
ser, attracted. 

“Cube roots, too. Are you with 
us?” 

Loesser’s hand thrust out sud- 
denly, “Count me in.” 

General Weider stumped his way 
back and forth at the head of the 
room and addressed his listeners 
after the fashion of a savage teacher 
facing a group of recalcitrant stu- 
dents. It made no difference to the 
general that they were the civilian 
scientists heading Project Number. 
The general was the over-all head, 
and he so considered himself at 
every waking moment. 

He said, “Now square roots are 
all fine. I can’t do them myself and 
I don’t understand the methods, 
but they’re fine. Still, the project 
will not be side-tracked into what 
some of you call the fundamentals. 
You can play with graphitics any 
way you want to after the war is 
over, but right now we have specific 
and very practical problems to 
solve.” 

In a far corner, Technician Aub 
listened with painful attention. He 
was no longer a technician, of 
course, having been relieved of his 
duties and assigned to the project, 
with a fine-sounding title and good 
pay. But, of course, the social dis- 
tinction remained and the highly- 
placed scientific leaders could never 
bring themselves to admit him to 
their ranks on a footing of equality. 
Nor did he, himself, wish it. He 
was as uncomfortable with them as 
they with him. 

The general was saying, “Our 
goal is a simple one, gentlemen ; the 
replacement of the computer. A 
ship that can navigate space with- 
out a computer on board can be 
constructed in one-fifth the time 
and at one-tenth the expense of a 
computer-laden ship. We could 
build fleets five times, ten times as 
great as Deneb could if we could 
but eliminate the computer. 

“And I see something even be- 
yond this. It may be fantastic now ; 
a mere dream; but in the future I 
see the manned missile!” 

There was an instant murmur 
from the audience. 

The general drove on. “At the 
present time, our chief bottleneck 
is the fact that missiles are limited 
in intelligence. The computer con- 
trolling them can only be so large 
so they can meet the changing na- 
ture of anti-missile defenses in an 
unsatisfactory way. Few missiles, if 
any, accomplish their goal and mis- 
sile warfare is coming to a dead 
end; for the enemy, fortunately, as 
well as for ourselves. 

“On the other hand, a missile 

with a man or two within, con- 
trolling flight by graphitics, would 
be lighter, more mobile, more in- 
telligent. It would give us a lead 
that might well mean the margin of 
victory. Besides which, gentlemen, 
the exigencies of war compel us to 
remember one thing. A man is 
much more dispensable than a com- 
puter. Manned missiles could be 
launched in numbers and under 
circumstances that no good general 
would care to undertake as far as 
computer-directed missiles are con- 
cerned — ” 

He said much more but Techni- 
cian Aub did not wait. 

Technician Aub, in the privacy 
of his quarters, labored long over 
the note he was leaving behind. It 
read finally as follows : 

“When I began the study of what 
is now called graphitics, it was no 
more than a hobby. I saw no more 
in it than an interesting amusement, 
an exercise of mind. 

“When Project Number began, 
I thought that others were wiser 
than I ; that graphitics might be put 
to practical use as a benefit to man- 

kind; to aid in the production of 
really practical mass-transference 
devices perhaps. But now I see it 
is to be used only for death. 

“I cannot face the responsibility 
involved in having invented gra- 
phitics.” 

He then deliberately turned the 
focus of a protein-depolarizer on 
himself and fell instantly and pain- 
lessly dead. 

They stood over the grave of the 
little Technician while tribute was 
paid to the greatness of his dis- 
covery. 

Programmer Shuman bowed his 
head along with the rest of them, 
but remained unmoved. The tech- 
nician had done his share and was 
no longer needed, after all. He 
might have started graphitics, but 
now that it had started, it would 
carry on by itself overwhelmingly, 
triumphantly, until manned mis- 
siles were possible, along with who 
knew what else. 

Nine times seven, thought Shu- 
man with deep satisfaction, is sixty- 
three and I don’t need a computer 
to tell me so. The computer is in 
my own head. 

And it was amazing the feeling 
of power that gave him. END
