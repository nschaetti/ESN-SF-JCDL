can imagine him wondering. What 
do we mean by “rise”? Can we be 
certain that tomorrow will come? Is 
the term “sun” completely unam- 
biguous in this connection? 

Add to this habit of speech a 
bland countenance, rather pale, with 
no expression except for a general 
look of uncertainty; gray hair, rather 
thin, neatly combed; business suits 
of an invariably conservative cut; 
and you have what Professor James 
Priss was — a retiring person, com- 
pletely lacking in magnetism. 

That’s why nobody in the world, 
except myself, could possibly suspect 
him of being a murderer. And even 
I am not sure. After all, he was 
slow-thinking; he was always slow- 
thinking. Is it conceivable that at one 
crucial moment, he managed to think 
quickly and act at once? 

It doesn’t matter. Even if he mur- 
dered, he got away with it. It is far 
too late now to try to reverse matters, 
and I wouldn’t succeed in doing so 
even if I decided to let this be pub- 
lished. 

E dward Bloom was Priss’s class- 
mate in college, and an associ- 
ate through circumstance for a gen- 
eration afterward. They were equal 
in age and in their propensity for 
the bachelor life, but opposites in 
everything else that mattered. 

Bloom was a living flash of light; 
colorful, tall, broad, loud, brash and 
self-confident. He had a mind that 
resembled a meteor-strike in the sud- 
den and unexpected way it could 
seize the essential. He was no theore- 
tician, as Priss was; Bloom had 
neither the patience for it, nor the 


capacity to concentrate intense 
thought upon a single abstract point. 
He admitted that. He boasted of it. 

What he did have was an uncanny 
way of seeing the application of a 
theory, of seeing the manner in which 
it could be put to use. In the cold 
marble block of abstract structure, 
he could see, without apparent dif- 
ficulty, the intricate design of a mar- 
velous device. The block would fall 
apart at his touch and leave the de- 
vice. 

It is a well known story, and not 
too badly exaggerated at that, that 
nothing Bloom ever built had failed 
to work, or to be patentable, or to 
be profitable. By the time he was 45, 
he was one of the richest men on 
Earth. 

And if Bloom the Technician were 
adapted to one particular matter 
more than anything else, it was to 
the way of thought of Priss the 
Theoretician. Bloom’s greatest gad- 
gets were built upon Priss’s greatest 
thoughts, and as Bloom grew weal- 
thy and famous, Priss gained phe- 
nomenal respect among his col- 
leagues. 

Naturally, it was to be expected 
that when Priss advanced his Two- 
Field Theory, Bloom would set about 
at once to build the first practical 
anti-gravity device. 

II 

M y job was to find human in- 
terest in the Two-Field Theory 
for the subscribers to Tele-News 
Press, and you get that by trying to 
deal with human beings and not 
with abstract ideas. Since my inter- 
viewee was Professor Priss, that 
wasn’t easy. 

Naturally, I was going to ask about 
the possibilities of anti-gravity, 
which interested everyone; and not 
about the Two-Field Theory, which 
no one could understand. 

“Anti-gravity?” Priss compressed 
his pale lips and considered. “I’m 
not entirely sure that it is possible. 
Or ever will be. I haven’t — uh — 
worked the matter out to my satis- 
faction. I don’t entirely see whether 
the Two-Field equations would have 
a finite solution, which they would 
have to have, of course, if — ” And 
then he went off into a brown study. 

I prodded him. “Bloom says he 
thinks such a device can be built.” 

Priss nodded. “Well, yes, but I 
wonder. Ed Bloom has had an amaz- 
ing knack at seeing the unobvious in 
the past. He has an unusual mind. 
It’s certainly made him rich enough.” 

We were sitting in Priss’s apart- 
ment. Ordinary middle-class. I 
couldn’t help a quick glance this 
way and that. Priss was not wealthy. 

I don’t think he read my mind. 
He saw me look. And I think it was 
on his mind. He said, “Wealth isn’t 
the usual reward for the pure sci- 
entist. Or even a particularly desir- 
able one.” 

Maybe so, at that, I thought. 
Priss certainly had his own kind of 
reward. He was the third person in 
history to win two Nobel Prizes; and 
the first to have both of them in 
the sciences and both of them unshar- 
ed. You can’t complain about that. 
And if he wasn’t rich, neither was he 
poor. 

But he didn’t sound like a con- 

tented man. Maybe it wasn’t Bloom’s 
wealth alone that irked Priss. May- 
be it was Bloom’s fame among the 
people of Earth generally; maybe it 
was the fact that Bloom was a cele- 
brity wherever he went, whereas 
Priss, outside scientific conventions 
and faculty clubs, was largely anony- 
mous. 

I can’t say how much of all this 
was in my eyes or in the way I 
wrinkled the creases in my forehead, 
but Priss went on to say, “But we’re 
friends, you know. We play billiards 
once or twice a week. I beat him 
regularly.” 

(I never published that statement. 
I checked it with Bloom, who made 
a long counter-statement that be- 
gan: “He beat me at billiards. That 
jackass — ” and grew increasingly 
personal thereafter. As a matter of 
fact, neither one was a novice at bil- 
liards. I watched them play once for 
a short while, after the statement and 
counter-statement, and both handled 
the cue with professional aplomb. 
What’s more, both played for blood, 
and there was no friendship in the 
game that I could see.) 

I said, “Would you care to pre- 
dict whether Bloom will manage to 
build an anti-gravity device?” 

“You mean would I commit my- 
self to anything? Hmm. Well, let’s 
consider, young man. Just what do 
we mean by anti-gravity? Our con- 
ception of gravity is built around 
Einstein’s General Theory of Re- 
lativity, which is now a century and 
a half old but which, within its lim- 
its, remains firm. We can picture 
it — ” 

I listened politely. I’d heard Priss 
on the subject before, but if I was 
to get anything out of him — which 
wasn’t certain — I’d have to let him 
work his way through in his own 
way. 

“We can picture it,” he said, “by 
imagining the universe to be a flat, 
thin, super-flexible sheet of untear- 
able rubber. If we picture mass as 
being associated with weight, as it 
is on the surface of the Earth, then 
we would expect a mass, resting up- 
on the rubber sheet, to make an in- 
dentation. The greater the mass, the 
deeper the indentation. 

“In the actual universe,” he went 
on, “all sorts of masses exist, and 
so our rubber sheet must be pictured 
as riddled with indentations. Any ob- 
ject rolling along the sheet would 
dip into and out of the indentations 
it passed, veering and changing direc- 
tion as it did so. It is this veer and 
change of direction that we interpret 
as demonstrating the existence of a 
force of gravity. If the moving ob- 
ject comes close enough to the cen- 
ter of the indentation and is moving 
slowly enough, it gets trapped and 
whirls round and round that inden- 
tation. In the absence of friction, it 
keeps up that whirl forever. In other 
words, what Isaac Newton inter- 
preted as a force, Albert Einstein in- 
terpreted as geometrical distortion.” 

H e paused at this point. He had 
been speaking fairly fluently — 
for him — since he was saying 
something he had said often before. 
But now he began to pick his way. 

He said, “So in trying to produce 
anti-gravity, we are trying to alter 
the geometry of the universe. If we 

carry on our metaphor, we are trying 
to straighten out the indented rubber 
sheet. We could imagine ourselves 
getting under the indenting mass and 
lifting it upward, supporting it so as 
to prevent it from making an inden- 
tation. If we make the rubber sheet 
flat in that way, then we create a* 
universe — or at least a portion of 
the universe — in which gravity 
doesn’t exist. A rolling body would 
pass the non-indenting mass without 
altering its direction of travel a bit, 
and we could interpret this as mean- 
ing that the mass was exerting no 
gravitational force. In order to ac- 
complish this feat, however, we need 
a mass equivalent to the indenting 
mass. To produce anti-gravity on 
Earth in this way, we would have to 
make use of a mass equal to that of 
Earth and poise it above our heads, 
so to speak.” 

I interrupted him. “But your Two- 
Field Theory — ” 

“Exactly. General Relativity does 
not explain both the gravitational 
field and the electromagnetic field in 
a single set of equations. Einstein 
spent half his life searching for that 
single set — for a Unified Field 
Theory — and failed. All who fol- 
lowed Einstein also failed. I, how- 
ever, began with the assumption that 
there were two fields that could not 
be unified and followed the conse- 
quences, which I can explain, in part, 
in terms of the rubber-sheet meta- 
phor.” 

Now we came to something I 
wasn’t sure I had ever heard before. 
“How does that go?” I asked. 

“Suppose that, instead of trying to 
lift the indenting mass, we try to stif- 
fen the sheet itself, make it less in- 
dentable. It would contract, at least 
over a small area, and become flat- 
ter. Gravity would weaken. And so 
would mass, for the two are essen- 
tially the same phenomenon in terms 
of the indented Universe. If we could 
make the rubber sheet completely 
flat, both gravity and mass would dis- 
appear altogether. 

“Under the proper conditions, the 
electromagnetic field could be made 
to counter the gravitational field and 
serve to stiffen the indented fabric of 
the universe. The electromagnetic 
field is tremendously stronger than 
the gravitational field, so the former 
could be made to overcome the lat- 
ter.” 

I said, uncertainly, “But you say 
‘under the proper conditions.’ Can 
those proper conditions you speak 
of be achieved, Professor?” 

“That is what I don’t know,” said 
Priss, thoughtfully and slowly. “If 
the universe were really a rubber 
sheet, its stiffness would have to 
reach an infinite value before it 
could be expected to remain com- 
pletely flat under an indenting mass. 
I f that is also so in the real universe, 
then an infinitely intense electromag- 
netic field would be required, and 
that would mean anti-gravity would 
be impossible.” 

“But Bloom says — ” 

“Yes, I imagine Bloom thinks a 
finite field will do, if it can be prop- 
erly applied. Still, however ingenious 
he is,” and Priss smiled narrowly, 
“we needn’t take him to be infallible. 
His grasp on theory is quite faulty. 
He - — he never earned his college 
degree, did you know that?” 


I was about to say that I knew 
that. After all, everyone did. But 
there was a touch of eagerness in 
Priss’s voice as he said it, and I look- 
ed up in time to catch animation in 
his eye, as though he were delighted 
to spread that piece of news. So I 
nodded my head as if I were filing it 
for future reference. 

“Then you would say, Professor 
Priss,” I prodded again, “that Bloom 
is probably wrong and that anti- 
gravity is impossible?” 

And finally Priss nodded and said, 
“The gravitational field can be weak- 
ened, of course, but if by anti-gravi- 
ty we mean a true zero-gravity field 
— no gravity at all over a significant 
volume of space — then I suspect 
anti-gravity may turn out to be im- 
possible, despite Bloom.” 

And I rather had what I wanted. 

Ill 

I wasn’t able to see Bloom for near- 
ly three months after that, and 
when I did see him he was in an 
angry mood. 

He had grown angry at once, of 
oourse, when the news first broke 
concerning Priss’s statement. He let 
it be known that Priss would be in- 
vited to the eventual display of the 
anti-gravity device as soon as it was 
constructed and would even be ask- 
ed to participate in the demonstra- 
tion. 

Some reporter (not me, unfor- 
tunately) caught him between ap- 
pointments and asked him to elabo- 
rate on that, and he said: 

“I’ll have the device eventually; 
soon, maybe. And you can be there, 
and so can anyone else the press 
would care to have there. And Pro- 
fessor James Priss can be there. He 
can represent Theoretical Science, 
and after I have demonstrated anti- 
gravity, he can adjust his theory to 
explain it. I’m sure he will know how 
to make his adjustments in masterly 
fashion and show exactly why I 
couldn’t possibly have failed. He 
might do it now and save time, but 
I suppose he won’t.” 

It was all said very politely, but 
you could hear the snarl under the 
rapid flow of words. 

Yet he continued his occasional 
game of billiards with Priss, and 
when the two met they behaved with 
complete propriety. One could tell 
the progress Bloom was making by 
their respective attitudes to the press. 
Bloom grew curt and even snappish, 
while Priss developed an increasing 
good humor. 

When my umpteenth request for 
an interview with Bloom was finally 
accepted, I wondered if perhaps that 
meant a break in Bloom’s quest. I 
had a little day-dream of him an- 
nouncing final success to me. 

It didn’t work out that way. He 
met me in his office at Bloom En- 
terprises in upstate New York. It 
was a wonderful setting; well away 
from any populated area, elaborate- 
ly landscaped, and covering as much 
ground as a rather large industrial 
establishment. Edison at his height, 
two centuries ago, had never been as 
phenomenally successful as Bloom. 

But Bloom was not in a good hu- 
mor. He came striding in ten minutes 
late and went snarling past his sec- 
retary’s desk with the barest nod in 

my direction. He was wearing a lab 
coat, unbuttoned. 

He threw himself into his chair 
and said, “I’m sorry if I’ve kept you 
waiting, but I didn’t have as much 
time as I had hoped.” Bloom was a 
born showman and knew better than 
to antagonize the press, but I had the 
feeling he was having a great deal of 
difficulty at that moment in adhering 
to this principle. 

I made the obvious guess. “I am 
given to understand, sir, that your 
recent tests have been unsuccessful.” 

“Who told you that?” 

“I would say it was general knowl- 
edge, Mr. Bloom.” 

“No, it isn’t. Don’t say that, young 
man! There is no general knowledge 
about what goes on in my labora- 
tories and workshops. You’re stating 
the professor’s opinions, aren’t you? 

“No, I’m — ” 

“Of course you are! Aren’t you 
the one to whom he made that state- 
ment — that anti-gravity is impossi- 
ble?” 

“He didn’t make the statement 
that flatly.” 

“He never says anything flatly. 
But it was flat enough for him. And 
not as flat as I’ll have his damned 
rubber-sheet universe before I’m fin- 
ished.” 

“Then does that mean you’re 
making progress, Mr. Bloom?” 

“You know I am,” he said with a 
snap. “Or you should know. Weren’t 
you there at the demonstration last 
week?” 

“Yes, I was.” 

I judged Bloom to be in trouble, 
or he wouldn’t be mentioning that 
demonstration. It worked, but it was 
not a world beater. Between the two 
poles of a magnet a region of lessen- 
ed gravity was produced. 

I t was done very cleverly. A Moss- 
bauer Effect Balance was used to 
probe the space between the poles. 
If you’ve never seen an M-E Bal- 
ance in action, it consists primarily 
of a tight monochromatic beam of 
gamma rays shot down the low-gravi- 
ty field. The gamma rays change 
wavelength slightly but measurably 
under the influence of the gravita- 
tional field and if anything happens 
to alter the intensity of the field, the 
wavelength-change shifts correspond- 
ingly. It is an extremely delicate 
method for probing a gravitational 
field, and it worked like a charm. 
There was no question but that 
Bloom had lowered gravity. 

The trouble was that it had been 
done before by others. Bloom, to be 
sure, had made use of circuits that 
greatly increased the ease with which 
such an effect had been achieved 
(his system was typically ingenious 
and had been duly patented), and he 
maintained that it was by this meth- 
od that anti-gravity would become 
not merely a scientific curiosity but 
a practical affair with industrial ap- 
plications. 

Perhaps! But it was an incomplete 
job, and he didn’t usually make 
a fuss over incompleteness. He 
wouldn’t have done so this time if he 
didn’t have to display something . 

I said, “It’s my impression that 
what you accomplished at that pre- 
liminary demonstration was 0.82 g, 
and better than that was achieved in 
Brazil last spring.” 


“That so? Well, calculate the 
energy input in Brazil and here and 
then tell me the difference in gravity 
decrease per kilowatt-hour. You’ll be 
surprised.” 

“But the point is, can you reach 

0 g; zero gravity? That’s wihat Pro- 
fessor Priss thinks may be impossi- 
ble. Everyone agrees that merely 
lessening the intensity of the field is 
no great feat.” 

Bloom’s fist clenched. I had the 
feeling that a key experiment had 
gone wrong that day and he was an- 
noyed almost past endurance. Bloom 
hated to be balked by the universe. 

He said, “Theoreticians make me 
sick.” He said it in a low, controlled 
voice, as though he were finally tired 
of not saying it, and he was going to 
speak his mind and be damned. 
“Priss has won two Nobel Prizes for 
sloshing around a few equations, but 
what has he done with it? Nothing! I 
have done something with it and I’m 
going to do more with it, whether 
Priss likes it or not. 

“/'ra the one people will remem- 
ber. I’m the one who gets the credit. 
He can keep his damned title and 
his Prizes and his kudos from the 
scholars. Listen, I’ll tell you what 
gripes him. Plain old-fashioned 
jealousy. It kills him that I get what 

1 get for doing. He wants it for 
thinking. 

“I said to him once — We play 
billiards together, you know — ” 

(It was at this point that I quoted 
Priss’s statement about billiards and 
got Bloom’s counterstatement. I 
never published either. That was just 
trivia.) 

“We play billiards,” said Bloom, 
when he had cooled down, “and I’ve 
won my share of games. We keep 
things friendly enough, what the hell 
— college chums and all that — 
though how he got through I’ll never 
know. He made it in physics, of 
course, and in math. But he got a 
bare pass — out of pity, I think — 
in every humanities course he ever 
took.” 

“You did not get your degree, did 
you, Mr. Bloom?” (That was sheer 
mischief on my part. I was enjoying 
his eruption.) 

“I quit to go into business, damn 
it! My academic average, over the 
three years I attended, was a strong 
B. Don’t imagine anything else, you 
hear? Hell, by the time Priss got his 
Pfa.D., I was working on my second 
million.” 

He went on, clearly irritated. 

“Anyway, we were playing billiards, 
and I said to him, ‘Jim, the average 
man will never understand why you 
get the Nobel Prize when I’m the 
one who gets the results. Why do you 
need two? Give me one!’ He stood 
there, chalking up his cue, and then 
he said in his soft namby-pamby 
way, ‘You have two billion, Ed. 
Give me one.’ So you see, he wants 
the money.” 

I said, “I take it you don’t mind 
his getting the honor?” 

For a minute, I thought he was go- 
ing to order me out. But he didn’t. 
He laughed instead, waved his hand 
in front of him, as though he were 
erasing something from an invisible 
blackboard in front of him. He said, 
“Oh, well, forget it. All that is off 
the record. Listen, do you want a 
statement? Okay! Things didn’t go 
right today, and I blew my top a bit, 
but it will clear up. I think I know 
what’s wrong. And if I don’t, I’m go- 
ing to know. 

“Look, you can say that / say that 
we don't need infinite electromag- 
netic intensity. We will flatten out 
the rubber sheet. We will have zero 
gravity. And when we get it, I’ll 
have the damnedest demonstration 
you ever saw, exclusively for the 
press and for Priss, and you’ll be in- 
vited. And you can say it won’t be 
long. Okay?” 

Okay! 

I had time after that to see each 
man once or twice more. I even 
saw them together when I was pres- 
ent at one of their billiard games. 
As I said before, both of them were 
good. 

But the call to the demonstration 
did not come as quickly as all that. It 
arrived six weeks less than a year 
after Bloom gave me his statement. 

And at that, perhaps it was unfair 
to expect quicker work. 

I had a special engraved invitation, 
with the assurance of a cocktail hour 
first. Bloom never did things by 
halves, and he was planning to have 
a pleased and satisfied group of re- 
porters on hand. There was an ar- 
rangement for tridimensional TV, 
too. Bloom felt completely confident, 
obviously; confident enough to be 
willing to trust the demonstration in 
every living room on the planet. 

I called up Professor Priss, to 
make sure he was invited, too. He 
was! 

“Do you plan to attend, sir?” 
There was a pause, and the pro- 
fessor’s face on the screen was a 
study in uncertain reluctance. “A 
demonstration of this sort is most 
unsuitable where a serious scientific 
matter is in question. I do not like 
to encourage such things.” 

I was afraid he would beg off, 
and the dramatics of the situation 
would be greatly lessened if he were 
not there. But then, perhaps, he de- 
cided he dared not play the chicken 
before the world. With obvious dis- 
taste, he said, “Of course, Ed Bloom 
is not really a scientist, and he must 
have his day in the sun. I’ll be there.” 
“Do you think Mr. Bloom can 
produce zero gravity, sir?” 

“ — uh — Mr. Bloom sent me a 
copy of the design of his device and 
— and I’m not certain. Perhaps he 
can do it, if — uh — he says he 
can do it. Of course — ” he paused 


again for quite a long time. “I think 
I would like to see it.” 

So would I, and so would many 
others. 

The staging was impeccable. A 
whole floor of the main building at 
Bloom Enterprises — the one on 
the hilltop — was cleared. There 
were the promised cocktails and a 
splendid array of hors d’oeuvres, soft 
music and lighting, and a carefully 
dressed and thoroughly jovial Ed- 
ward Bloom playing the perfect host, 
while a number of polite and un- 
obtrusive menials fetched and car- 
ried. All was geniality and amazing 
confidence. 

James Priss was late, and I caught 
Bloom watching the corners of the 
crowd and beginning to grow a little 
grim about the edges. Then Priss 
arrived, dragging a volume of color- 
lessness in with him, a drabness that 
was unaffected by the noise and the 
absolute splendor (no other word 
would describe it — or else it was 
the two martinis glowing inside me) 
that filled the room. 

Bloom saw him, and his face was. 
illuminated at once. He bounced 
across the floor, seizing the smaller 
man’s hand and dragging him to the 
bar. 

“Jim! Glad to see you! What’ll 
you have? Hell, man, I’d have called 
it off if you hadn’t showed. Can’t 
have this thing without the star, you 
know.” He wrung Priss’s hand. “It’s 
your theory, you know. We poor 
mortals can’t do a thing without you 
few, you damned few few, pointing 
the way.” 

He was being ebullient, handing 
out the flattery, because he could af- 
ford to do so now. He was fattening 
Priss for the kill. 

Priss tried to refuse a drink, with 
some sort of mutter, but a glass was 
pressed into his hand; and Bloom 
raised his voice to a bullroar. 

“Gentlemen! A moment’s quiet, 
please. To Professor Priss, the 
greatest mind since Einstein, two- 
time Nobel Laureate, father of the 
Two-Field Theory, and inspirer of the 
demonstration we are about to see 
— even if he didn’t think it would 
work and he had the guts to say so 
publicly.” 

There was a distinct titter of laugh- 
ter that quickly faded out, and Priss 
looked as grim as he could manage. 

“But now that Professor Priss is 
here,” said Bloom, “and we’ve had 
our toast, let’s get on with it. Fol- 
low me, gentlemen!” 


T he demonstration was in a much 
more elaborate place than had 
housed the earlier one. This time it 
was on the top floor of the building. 
Different magnets were involved — 
smaller ones, by heaven — but as 
nearly as I could tell, the same M-E 
Balance was in place. 

One thing was new, however, and 
it staggered everybody, drawing 
much more attention than anything 
else in the room. It was a billiard 
table, resting under one pole of the 
magnet. Beneath it was the compan- 
ion pole. A round hole about a foot 
across was stamped out of the very 
center of the table; and it was ob- 
vious that the zero-gravity field, if it 
was to be produced, would be pro- 
duced through that hole in the center 
of the billiard table. 

It was as though the whole dem- 
onstration had been designed, sur- 
realist-fashion, to point up the vic- 
tory of Bloom over Priss. This was 
to be another version of their ever- 
lasting billiards competition, and 
Bloom was going to win. 

I don’t know if the other newsmen 
took matters in that fashion, but I 
think Priss did. I turned to look at 
him and saw that he was still hold- 
ing the drink that had been forced 
into his hand. He rarely drank, I 
knew, but now he lifted the glass to 
his lips and emptied it in two swal- 
lows. He stared at that billiard ball, 
and I needed no gift of ESP to re- 
alize that he took it as a deliberate 
snap of fingers under his nose. 

Bloom led us to the twenty seats 
that surrounded three sides of the 
table, leaving the fourth free as a 
working area. Priss was carefully es- 
corted to the seat commanding the 
most convenient view. Priss glanced 
quickly at the tri-di cameras which 
were now working. I wondered if he 
were thinking of leaving but decid- 
ing that he couldn’t in the full glare 
of the eyes of the world. 

Essentially, the demonstration was 
simple; it was the production that 
counted. There were dials in plain 
view that measured the energy ex- 
penditure. There were others that 
transferred the M-E Balance readings 
into a position and a size that were 
visible to all. Everything was ar- 
ranged for easy tri-di viewing. 

Bloom explained each step in a 
genial way, with one or two pauses 
in which he turned to Priss for a con- 
firmation that had to come. He didn’t 
do it often enough to make it ob- 
vious, but just enough to turn Priss 
upon the spit of his own torment. 
From where I sat I could look across 
the table and see Priss on the other 
side. 

He had the look of a man in Hell. 

A s we all know, Bloom succeeded. 

The M-E Balance showed the 
gravitational intensity to be sinking 
steadily as the electromagnetic field 
was intensified. There were cheers, 
when it dropped below the 0.52 g 
mark. A red line indicated that on 
the dial. 

“The 0.52 g mark, as you know,” 
said Bloom, confidently, “represents 
the previous record low in gravita- 
tional intensity. We are now lower 
than that at a cost in electricity that 
is less than ten per cent what it cost 
at the time that mark was set. And 
we will go lower still.” 

Bloom (I think deliberately, for 
the sake of the suspense) slowed the 
drop toward the end, letting the tri- 
di cameras switch back and forth be- 
tween the gap in the billiard table 
and the dial on which the M-E Bal- 
ance reading was lowering. 

Bloom said, suddenly, “Gentle- 
men, you will find dark goggles in 
the pouch on the side of each chair. 
Please put them on now. The zero- 
gravity field will soon be established, 
and it will radiate a light rich in ul- 
traviolet.” 

He put goggles on himself, and 
there was a momentary rustle as oth- 
ers went on, too. 

I think no one breathed during 
the last minute, when the dial read- 
ing dropped to zero and held fast. 
And just as that happened a cylinder 
of light sprang into existence from 
pole to pole through the hole in the 
billiard table. 

There was a ghost of twenty sighs 
at that. Someone called out, “Mr. 
Bloom, what is the reason for the 
light?” 

“It’s characteristic of the zero- 
gravity field,” said Bloom smoothly, 
which was no answer of course. 

Reporters were standing up now, 
crowding about the edge of the ta- 
ble. Bloom waved them back. 
“Please, gentlemen, stand clear!” 

Only Priss remained sitting. He 
seemed lost in thought, and I have 
been certain ever since that it was 
the goggles that obscured the possi- 
ble significance of everything that 
followed. I didn’t see his eyes. I 
couldn’t. And that meant neither I 
nor anyone else could even begin to 
make a guess as to what was going 
on behind those eyes. 

Well, maybe we couldn’t have 
made such a guess, even if the 
goggles hadn’t been there, but who 
can say? 

Bloom was raising his voice again. 
“Please! The demonstration is not 
yet over. So far, we’ve only repeated 
what I have done before,. I have now 
produced a zero-gravity field and I 
have shown it can be done practical- 
ly. But I want to demonstrate some- 
thing of what such a field can do. 
What we are going to see next will 
be something that has never been 
seen, not even by myself. I have not 
experimented in this direction, much 
as I would have liked to, because I 
have felt that Professor Priss deserv- 
ed the honor of — ” 

Priss looked up sharply, “What — 
what — ” 

“Professor Priss,” said Bloom, 
smiling broadly, “I would like you to 
perform the first experiment involv- 
ing the interaction of a solid object 
with a zero-gravity field. Notice that 
the field has been formed in the cen- 
ter of a billiard table. The world 
knows your phenomenal skill in bil- 
liards, Professor, a talent second only 
to your amazing aptitude in theore- 
tical physics. Won’t you send a bil- 
liard ball into the zero-gravity 
volume?” 

E agerly, he was handing a ball and 
cue to the professor. Priss, his 
eyes hidden by the goggles, stared at 
them and only very slowly, very un- 
certainly, reached out to take them. 
I wonder what his eyes were show- 


ing. I wonder, too, how much of the 
decision to have Priss play billiards 
at the demonstration was due to 
Bloom’s anger at Priss’s remark 
about their periodic game, the re- 
mark I had quoted. Had I been, in 
my way, responsible for what follow- 
ed? 

“Come, stand up, Professor,” said 
Bloom, “and let me have your seat. 
The show is yours from now on. Go 
ahead!” 

Bloom seated himself and still 
talked, in a voice that grew more 
organlike with each moment. “Once 
Professor Priss sends the ball into the 
volume of zero-gravity, it will no 
longer be affected by Earth’s gravi- 
tational field. It will remain truly 
motionless while the Earth rotates 
about its axis and travels about the 
sun. In this latitude, and at this time 
of day, I have calculated that the 
Earth, in its motions, will sink down- 
ward. We will move with it, and the 
ball will stand still. To us it will seem 
to rise up and away from the Earth’s 
surface. Watch.” 

Priss seemed to stand in front of 
the table in frozen paralysis. Was it 
surprise? Astonishment? I don’t 
know. I’ll never know. Did he make 
a move to interrupt Bloom’s little 
speech, or was he just suffering from 
an agonized reluctance to play the 
ignominious part into which he was 
being forced by his adversary? 

Priss turned to the billiard table, 
looking first at it, then back at 
Bloom. Every reporter was on his 
feet, crowding as closely as possible 
in order to get a good view. Only 
Bloom himself remained seated, smil- 
ing and isolated. (He, of course, was 
not watching the table, or the balls, 
or the zero-gravity field. As nearly 
as I could tell through the goggles, 
he was watching Priss.) 

Priss turned to the table and 
placed his ball. He was going to be 
the agent that was to bring final and 
dramatic triumph to Bloom and 
make himself — the man who said 
it couldn’t be done — the goat to 
be mocked forever. 

Perhaps he felt there was no way 
out. Or perhaps — 

With a sure stroke of his cue, he 
set the ball into motion. It was not 
going quickly, and every eye follow- 
ed it. It struck the side of the table 
and caromed. It was going even 
slower now as though Priss himself 
were increasing the suspense and 
making Bloom’s triumph the more 
dramatic. 

I had a perfect view, for I was 
standing on the side of the table op- 
posite from that where Priss was. I 
could see the ball moving toward 
the glitter of the zero-gravity field, 
and beyond it I could see those por- 
tions of the seated Bloom which 
were not hidden by that glitter. 

The ball approached the zero- 
gravity volume, seemed to hang on 
the edge for a moment and then was 
gone, with a streak of light, the 
sound of a thunder-clap and the sud- 
den smell of burning cloth. 

We yelled. We all yelled. 

I’ve seen the scene on television 
since — along with the rest of the 
world. I can see myself in the film 
during that fifteen second period of 
wild confusion, but I don’t really 
recognize my face. 

Fifteen seconds! 

And then we discovered Bloom. 
He was still sitting in the chair, his 
arms still folded — but there was a 
hole the size of a billiard ball 
through left wrist, chest and back. 
The better part of his heart, as it 
later turned out under autopsy, had 
been neatly punched out.’ 

They turned off the device. They 
called in the police. They dragged 
off Priss, who was in a state of utter 
collapse. I wasn’t much better off, to 
tell the truth, and if any reporter 
then on the scene ever tried to say he 
remained a cool observer of that 
scene, then he’s a cool liar. 

V 

I t was some months before I got 
to see Priss again. He had lost 
some weight but seemed well other- 
wise, Indeed, there was color in his 
cheeks and an air of decision about 
him. He was better dressed than I 
had ever seen him to be. 

He said, “I know what happened 
now, If I had had time to think, I 
would have known then. But I am a 
slow thinker, and poor Ed Bloom was 
so intent on running a great show 
and doing it so well that he carried 
me along with him. Naturally, I’ve 
been trying to make up for some of 
the damage I unwittingly caused.” 
“You can’t bring Bloom back to 
life,” I said, soberly. 

“No, I can’t,” he said, just as 
soberly. “But there’s Bloom Enter- 
prises to think of, too. What hap- 
pened at the demonstration, in full 
view of the world, was the worst 
possible advertisement for zero-gravi- 
ty, and it’s important that the story 
be made clear. That is why l have 
asked to see you." 

“Yes?” 

“If I had been a quicker thinker, 
I would have known Ed was speak- 
ing the purest nonsense, when he 
said that the billiard ball would slow- 
ly rise in the zero-gravity field. It 
couldn't be so! If Bloom hadn’t des- 
pised theory so, if he hadn’t been so 
intent on being proud of his own 
ignorance of theory, he’d have 
known it himself. 

“The Earth’s motion, after all, 
isn’t the only motion involved, 
young man. The sun itself moves in 
a vast orbit about the center of the 
Milky Way galaxy. And the galaxy 
moves, too, in some not very clear- 
ly defined way. If the billiard ball 
were subjected to zero gravity, you 
might think of it as being unaffected 
by any of these motions and there- 
fore of suddenly falling into a state 
of absolute rest — when there is no 
such thing as absolute rest.” 

Priss shook his head slowly. “The 
trouble with Ed, I think, was that 
he was thinking of the kind of zero- 
gravity one gets in a spaceship in 
free fall, when people float in mid- 
air. He expected the ball to float in 
mid-air. However, in a spaceship, 
zero gravity is not the result of an 
absence of gravitation, but merely 
the result of two objects, a ship and 
a man within the ship, falling at the 
same rate, responding to gravity in 
precisely the same way, so that each 
is motionless with respect to the oth- 
er. 

“In the zero-gravity field pro- 
duced by Ed, there was a flattening 
of the rubber-sheet universe, which 

means an actual loss of mass. 
Everything in that field, including 
molecules of air caught within it, and 
the billiard ball I pushed into it, was 
completely massless as long as it re- 
mained with it. A completely mass- 
less object can move in only one 
way.” 

He paused, inviting the question. 
I asked, “What motion would that 
be?” 

“Motion at the speed of light. Any 
massless object, such as a neutrino 
or a photon, must travel at the speed 
of light as long as it exists. In fact, 
light moves at that speed only be- 
cause it is made up of photons. As 
soon as the billiard ball entered the 
zero-gravity field and lost its mass, 
it, too, assumed the speed of light 
at once and left.” 

I shook my head. “But didn’t it re- 
gain its mass as soon as it left 
the zero-gravity volume?” 

“It certainly did, and at once it 
began to be affected by the gravita- 
tional field and to slow up in re- 
sponse to the friction of the air and 
the top of the billiard table. But 
imagine how much friction it would 
take to slow up an object the mass of 
a billiard ball going at the speed of 
light. It went through the hundred- 
mile thickness of our atmosphere in 
a thousandth of a second, and I doubt 
that it was slowed more than a few 
miles a second in doing so; a few 
miles out of 186,282 of them. On the 
way, it scorched the top of the bil- 
liard table, broke cleanly through 
the edge, went through poor Ed and 
the window too, punching out neat 
circles, because it had passed 
through before the neighboring por- left with an incredible quantity of 
tions of something even as brittle kinetic energy. Where did the energy 
as glass had a chance to split and come from?”

not sure I liked it. “How is that pos- if he had only not been so foolishly 
sible? The billiard ball entered the anxious to put on his show — ” 
zero-gravity volume almost at a “What accounts for the radiation, 
standstill. I saw it. And you say it sir?” 

“The molecules of air inside the 
volume! Each assumes the speed of 
light and comes smashing outward. 
They’re only molecules, not billiard 
balls, so they’re stopped, but the 
kinetic energy of their motion is con- 
verted into energetic radiation. It’s 
continuous because new molecules 
are always drifting in and attaining 
the speed of light and smashing out.” 

“Then energy is being created 
continuously?” 

“Exactly. And that is what we 
must make clear to the public. Anti- 
gravity is not primarily a device to 
lift spaceships or to revolutionize 
mechanical movement. Rather it is 
the source of an endless supply of 
free energy, since part of the energy 
produced can be diverted to maintain 
the field that keeps that portion of 
the universe flat. What Ed Bloom 
invented, without knowing it, was 
not just anti-gravity, but the first 
successful perpetual motion machine 
of the first class — one that manu- 
factures energy out of nothing.” 

I said, slowly, “Any one of us 
could have been killed by that billi- 
ard ball, is that right, professor? It 
might have come out in any direc- 
tion.” 

Priss said, “Well, massless photons 
emerge from any light source at the 
speed of light in any direction; that’s 
why a candle casts light in all direc- 
tions. The massless air molecules 
come out of the zero-gravity volume 
in all directions, which is why the 
entire cylinder radiates. But the billi- 
ard ball was only one object. It 
could have come out in any direc- 
tion, but it had to come out in some 
one direction, chosen at random, and 

the chosen direction happened to be 
the one that caught Ed.” 

T hat was it. Everyone knows the 
consequences. Mankind had free 
energy and so we have the world we 
have now. Professor Priss was placed 
in charge of its development by the 
board of Bloom Enterprises, and in 
time he was as rich and famous as 
ever Edward Bloom had been. And 
Priss still has two Nobel Prizes in 
addition. 

Only — 

I keep thinking. Photons smash out 
from a light source in all directions 
because they are created at the mo- 
ment and there is no reason for them 
to move in one direction more than 
in another. Air molecules come out 
of a zero-gravity field in all direc- 
tions because they enter it in all di- 
rections. 

But what about a single billiard 
ball, entering a zero-gravity field 
from one particular direction. Does 
it come out in the same direction or 
in any direction? 

I’ve inquired delicately, but theore- 
tical physicists don’t seem to be sure, 
and I can find no record that Bloom 
Enterprises, which is the only organi- 
zation working with zero-gravity 
fields, has ever experimented in the 
matter. Someone at the organiza- 
tion once told me that the uncer- 
tainty principle guarantees the ran- 
dom emergence of an object entering 
in any direction. But then why don’t 
they try the experiment? 

Could it be, then — 

Could it be that for once Priss’s 
mind had been working quickly? 
Could it be that, under the pressure 
of what Bloom was trying to do to 
him, Priss had suddenly seen every- 
thing. He had been studying the ra- 
diation surrounding the zero-gravity 
volume. He might have realized its 
cause and been certain of the speed- 
of-light motion of anything entering 
the volume. 

Why, then, had he said nothing? 

One thing is certain. Nothing 
Priss would do at the billiard table 
could be accidental. He was an ex- 
pert and the billiard balls did exactly 
what he wanted them to. I was stand- 
ing right there. I saw him look at 

Bloom and then at the table as 
though he were judging angles. 

I watched him hit that ball. I 
watched it bounce off the side of the 
table and move into the zero-gravity 
volume, heading in one particular 
direction. 

For when Priss sent that ball 
toward the zero-gravity volume — 
and the tri-di films bear me out — 
it was already aimed directly at 
Bloom’s heart! 

Accident? Coincidence? 

Murder?
