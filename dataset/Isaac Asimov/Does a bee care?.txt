Even 8000 years is not too 
long when instinct drives a 
creature. And Kane was will- 
ing to wait . 

DOES A BEE 
CARE? 

T he ship began as a metal 
skeleton. Slowly a shining skin 
was layered on without and odd- 
shaped vitals were crammed with- 
in. 

Thornton Hammer, of all the 
individuals (but one) involved in 
the growth, did the least physically. 
Perhaps that was why he was most 
highly regarded. He handled the

mathematical symbols that formed 
the basis for lines on drafting 
paper which, in turn, formed the 
basis for the fitting-together the 
various masses and different forms 
of energy that went into the ship. 

Hammer watched now through 
close-fitting spectacles somberly. 
Their lenses caught the light of 
the fluorescent tubes above and 
sent them out again as high-lights. 
Theodore Lengyel, representing 
Personnel of the corporation that 
was footing the bill for the project, 
stood beside him and said, as he 
pointed with a rigid, stabbing 
finger, 

“There he is. That’s the man.” 
Hammer peered. “You mean 
Kane?” 

“The fellow in the green over- 
alls, holding a wrench.” 

“That’s Kane. Now what is this 
you’ve got against him?” 

“I want to know what he does. 
The man’s an idiot.” Lengyel had 
a round, plump face and his jowls 
quivered a bit. 

Hammer turned to look at the 
other, his spare body assuming an 
air of displeasure along every inch. 
“Have you been bothering him?” 
^'Bothering him? I’ve been talk- 
ing to him. It’s my job to talk to 
the men, to get their viewpoints, to 
get information out of which I can 
build campaigns for improved 
morale.” 

“How does Kane disturb that?” 
“He’s insolent. I asked him how 
it felt to be working on a ship that 
would reach the moon? I talked a 
little about the ship being a path- 
way to the stars. Perhaps I made 
a little speech about it, built it 

up a bit, when he turned away in 
the rudest possible manner. I 
called him back and said, ‘Where 
are you going?’ And he said, ‘I get 
tired of that kind of talk. I’m going 
out to look at the stars.’ ” 

Hammer nodded. “All right. 
Kane likes to look at the stars.” 

“It was daytime. The man’s an 
idiot. I’ve been watching him since 
and he doesn’t do any work.” 

“I know that.” 

“Then why is he kept on?” 
Hammer said with a sudden, 
tight fierceness, “Because I want 
him around. Because he’s my luck.” 
“Your luck?” faltered Lengyel. 
“What the hell does that mean?” 
“It means that when he’s around 
I think better. When he passes me, 
holding his damned wrench, I get 
ideas. It’s happened three times. I 
don’t explain it; I’m not interested 
in explaining it. It’s happened. He 
stays.” 

“You’re joking.” 

“No, I’m not. Now leave me 
alone.” 

Kane stood there in his green 
overalls, holding his wrench. 

Dimly he was aware that the ship 
was almost ready. It was not de- 
signed to carry a man, but there 
was space for a man. He knew that 
the way he knew a lot of things; 
like keeping out of the way of most 
people most of the time; like carry- 
ing a wrench until people grew 
used to him carrying a wrench and 
stopped noticing it. Protective 
coloration consisted of little things, 
really, — like carrying the wrench. 

He was full of drives he did not 
fully understand; like looking at 
the stars. At first, many years back, 
he had just looked at the stars with 
a va^e ache. Then, slowly, his 
attention had centered itself on a 
certain region of the sky, then to 
a certain pin-pointed spot. He 
didn’t know why that certain spot. 
There were no stars in that spot. 
There was nothing to see. 

That spot was high in the night- 
sky in the late spring and in the 
summer months and he sometimes 
spent most of the night watching 
the spot until it sank toward the 
southwestern horizon. At other 
times in the year he would stare at 
the spot during the day. 

There was some thought in con- 
nection with that spot which he 
couldn’t quite crystallize. It had 
grown stronger, come nearer the 
surface as the years passed and it 
was almost bursting for expression 
now. But still it had not quite come 
clear. 

Kane shifted restlessly and ap- 
proached the ship. It was almost 
complete, almost whole. Every- 
thing fitted just so. Almost. 

For within it, far forward, was a 
hole a little larger than a man; 
and leading to that hole was a 
pathway a little wider than a man. 
Tomorrow that pathway would be 
filled with the last of the vitals and 
before that was done, the hole had 
to be filled, too. But not with any- 
thing they planned. 

Kane moved still closer and no 
one paid any attention to him. 
They were used to him. 

There was a metal ladder that 
had to be climbed and a catwalk 
that had to be moved along to 
enter the last opening. He knew 
where the opening was as exactly 
as though he had built the ship 
with his own hands. He climbed the 
ladder and moved along the cat- 
walk. 

It was dark in the hole and, of 
course, there was no ventilation, 
but Kane paid no attention to that. 
With the sureness of instinct, he 
clambered upward toward the hole 
that would receive him, then lay 
there panting, flitting the cavity 
neatly as though it were a womb. 

In two hours they would begin 
inserting the last of the vitals, close 
the passage and leave Kane there, 
unknowing. Kane would be the 
sole bit of flesh and blood in a 
thing of nietal and ceramics and 
fuel. 

Kane was not afraid of being 
prematurely discovered. No one in 
the project knew the hole was 
there. The design didn’t call for 
it. The mechanics and construc- 
tion men weren’t aware of having 
put it in. 

Kane had arranged that entirely 
by himself. 

He didn’t know how he had 
arranged it, but he knew he had. 

He could watch his own influence 
without knowing how it was ex- 
erted. Take the man, Hammer, for 
instance, the leader of the project 
and the most clearly influenced. Of 
all the indistinct figures about 
Kane, he was the least indistinct. 
Kane would be very aware of him 
at times, when he passed near him 
in his slow and hazy journeys about 
the grounds. It was all that was 
necessary, — passing near him. 

Kane recalled it had been so 
before, particularly with theoreticians. 
When Lise Meitner de- 
cided to test for barium among 
the products of the neutron bom- 
bardment of uranium, Kane had 
been there, an unnoticed plodder 
along a corridor nearby. 

He had been picking up leaves 
and trash in a park in 1904 when 
the young Einstein had passed by, 
pondering. Einstein’s steps had 
quickened with the impact of sud- 
den thought. Kane felt it like an 
electric shock. 

But he didn’t know how it was 
done. Does a spider know archi- 
tectural theory when it begins to 
construct its first web?” 

It went further back. The eve- 
ning the young Newton had stared 
at the Moon with the dawn of a 
certain thought, Kane had been 
there. And further back still 

HE PANORAMA of New 
Mexico, ordinarily deserted, 
was alive with human ants crawling 
about the metal shaft lancing up- 
ward. This one was different from 
all the similar structures that had 
preceded it. 

This would go free of Earth more 
nearly than any other. It would 
reach out and circle the Moon be- 
fore falling back. It would be 
crammed with instniments that 
would photograph the Moon and 
measure its heat, emissions, probe 
for radioactivity, and test by 
micro-wave for chemical structure. 
It would, by automation, do almost 
everything that could be expected 
of a manned vehicle. And it would 
learn enough to make certain that 
the next ship sent out would be a 
manned vehicle also. 

Except that, in a way, this first 
one was a manned vehicle after all. 

There were representatives of 
various governments, of various 
industries, of various social and 
economic groupings. There were 
television cameras and feature 
writers. 

Those who could not be there, 
watched in their homes, and heard 
numbers counted backward in 
painstaking monotone in the man- 
ner grown traditional in a mere 
three decades. 

At zero, the reaction motors came 
to life and ponderously the ship 
lifted. 

Kane heard the noise of the rush- 
ing gases, as though from a dis- 
tance, and felt the gathering accel- 
eration press against him. 

He detached his mind, lifting it 
up and outward, freeing it from 
direct connection with his body in 
order that he might be unaware of 
the pain and discomfort. 

Dizzily, he knew his long journey 
was nearly over. He would no 
longer have to maneuver carefully 
to avoid having people realize he 
was immortal. He would no longer 
have to fade into the background, 
no longer wander eternally from 
place to place, changing names and 
personality, manipulating minds. 

It had not been perfect, of 
course. The myths of the Wander- 
ing Jew and the Flying Dutchman 
had arisen, but he was still here. 
He had not been disturbed. 

He could see his spot in the sky. 
Through the mass and solidity of 
the ship he could see it. Or not 
‘%ee” really. He didn’t have the 
proper word. 

He knew there was a proper 
word, though. He could not say 
how he knew a fraction of the 
things he knew except that as the 
centuries had passed he had grad- 
ually grown to know them with 
a sureness that required no reason. 

He had begun as an ovum (or 
as something for which ‘‘ovum” 
was the nearest word he knew) , de- 
posited on Earth before the first 
cities had been built by the wan- 
dering hunting-creatures since 
called men. Earth had been chosen 
carefully by his progenitor. Not ev- 
ery world would do. 

What world would? What was 
the criterion?” That he still didn’t 
know. 

Does an ichneumon wasp study 
entomology before it finds the one 
species of spider that will do for 
her eggs and stings it just so in 
order diat it may remain alive? 

The ovum spilt him forth at 
length and he took the shape of a 
man and lived among men and 
protected himself against men. And 
his one purpose was to arrange to 
have men travel along a path that 
would end with a ship and within 
the ship a hole and within the hole 
himself. It had taken eight thou- 
sand years of slow striving and 
stumbling. 

The spot In the sky became 
sharper now as the ship moved out 
of the atmosphere. That was the 

key that opened his mind, the piece 
that completed the puzzle. 

Stars blinked within that spot 
that could not be seen by a man’s 
eye unaided. One in particular 
shone brilliantly and Kane yearned 
toward it. The expression that had 
been building within him for so 
long burst out now. 

“Home,” he whispered. 

He knew! Does a salmon study 
cartography to find the headwaters 
of the fresh-water stream in which 
years before it had been born? 

The final step was thus com- 
pleted in the slow maturing that 
had taken eight thousand years, 
and Kane was no longer larval, 
but adult. 

The adult Kane fled from the 
human flesh that had protected 
the larva, and fled the ship, too. 
Kane hastened onward, at incon- 
ceivable speeds, toward home, 
from which some day it, too, might 
set off on wanderings through space 
to fertilize some planet with its 
ovum. 

It sped through Space, giving no 
thought, to the ship carrying an 
empty chrysalis. It gave no thought 
to the fact that it had driven a 
whole world toward technology and 
space-travel in order only that it 
might mature and reach its ful- 
fillment. 

Does a bee care what has hap- 
pened to a flower when the bee 
has dcme and gone its way?
