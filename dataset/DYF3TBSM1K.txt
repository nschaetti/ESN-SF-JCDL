FRANCHISE 

It was a frightening thing to happen to a person; the responsi- 
bility was just too great. But Norman Muller couldn’t back 
out. Multivac had chosen him, and the entire nation waited .

L inda, aged lO, was the only 
^one of the family who seemed 
to enjoy being awake. 

Norman Muller could hear her 
now through his own drugged, un- 
healthy coma. (He had finally 
managed to fall asleep an hour 
earlier but even then it was more 
like exhaustion than sleep.) 

She was at his bedside now, 
shaking him. “Daddy, Daddy, wake 
up. Wake up!” 

He suppressed a groan. “All 
right, Linda.” 

“But, Daddy, there’s more 
policemen around than any time! 
Police cars and everything!” 

Norman Muller gave up and rose 
blearily to his elbows. The day was 
beginning. It was faintly stirring 
toward dawn outside, the germ of 
a miserable gray that looked about 
as miserably gray as he felt. He 
could hear Sarah, his wife, shuf- 
fling about breakfast duties in the 
kitchen. His father-in-law, Mat- 
thew, was hawking strenuously in 
the bathroom. No doubt Agent 
Handley was ready and waiting for 
him. 

This was the day. 

Election day! 

To begin with, it had been like 
every other year. Maybe a little 
worse, because it was a Presiden- 
tial year, but no worse than other 
Presidential years if it came to that. 

The politicians spoke about the 
guh-reat electorate and the vast 
electuh-ronic intelligence that was 
its servant. The press analyzed the 
situation with industrial computers 
(the New York Times and the St. 
Louis Post-Dispatch had their own 
computers) and were full of little 
hints as to what would be forth- 
coming. Commentators and col- 
umnists pin-pointed the crucial 
state and county in happy contra- 
diction to one another. 

The first hint that it would not 
be like every other year, was when 
Sarah Muller said to her husband 
on the evening of October 4 (with 
Election Day exactly a month off), 
“Cantwell Johnson says that In- 
diana will be the state this year. 
He’s the fourth one. Just think, 
our state this time.” 

Matthew Hortenweiler took his 
fleshy face from behind the paper, 
stared dourly at his daughter and 
growled, “Those fellows are paid 
to tell lies. Don’t listen to them.” 
“Four of them, Father,” said 
Sarah, mildly. “Tliey all say In- 
diana.” 

“Indiana is a key state, Mat- 
thew,” said Norman, just as mildly, 
“on account of the Hawkins-Smith 
Act and this mess in Indianapolis. 
It—” 

Matthew twisted his old face 
alarmingly and rasped out, “No 
one says Bloomington or Monroe 
County, do they?” 

“Well — ” said Norman. 

Linda, whose little point-chin 
face had been shifting from one 
speaker to the next, said pipingly, 
“You going to be voting this year. 
Daddy?” 

Norman smiled gently and said, 
“I don’t think so, dear.” 

But this was in the gradually 
growing excitement of an October 
in a Presidential Election Year and 
Sarah had led a quiet life with 
dreams for her companions. She 
said, longingly, “Wouldn’t that be 
wonderful, though?” 

“If I voted?” Norman Muller 
had a small, blonde mustache that 
had given him a debonair quality 
in the young Sarah’s eyes, but 
which, with gradual graying, had 
declined merely to lack of dis- 
tinction. His forehead bore deepen- 
ing lines bom of uncertainty and, 
in general, he had never seduced 
his clerkly soul with the thought 
that he was either born great or 
would under any circumstances 
achieve greatness. He had a wife, 
a job and a little girl and except 
under extraordinary conditions of 
elation or depression was inclined 
to consider that to be an adequate 
bargain struck with life. 

So he was a little embarrassed 
and more than a little uneasy at 
the direction his wife’s thoughts 
were taking. “Actually, my dear,” 
he said, “there are two hundred 
million people in the country, and 
with odds like that, I don’t think 
we ought to waste our time won- 
dering about it.” 

His wife said, “Why, Norman, 
it’s no such thing like two hundred 
million and you know it. In the 
first place, only people between 20 
and 60 are eligible and it’s always 
men, so that puts it down to may- 
be fifty million to one. Then, if it’s 
really Indiana — ” 

“Then it’s about one and a quar- 
ter million to one. You wouldn’t 
want me to bet in a horse race 
against those odds, now, would 
you? Let’s have supper.” 

Matthew muttered from behind 
his newspaper, “Damned foolish- 
ness.” 

Linda asked again, “You going 
to be voting this year, Daddy?” 
Norman shook his head and they 
all adjourned to the dining room. 

B y OCTOBER 20, Sarah’s ex- 
citement was rising rapidly. 
Over the coffee, she announced 
that Mrs. Schultz, having a cousin 
who was the secretary of an As- 
semblyman, said that all the “smart 
money” was on Indiana. 

“She says President Villers is 
even going to make a speech at 
Indianapolis.” 

Norman Muller, who had had a 
hard day at the store, nudged the 
statement with a raising of eye- 
brows and let it go at that. 

Matthew Hortenweiler, who was 
chronically dissatisfied with Wash- 
ington, said, “If Villers makes a 
speech in Indiana, that means he 
thinks Multivac will pick Arizona. 
He wouldn’t have the guts to go 
closer, the mushhead.” 

Sarah, who ignored her father 
whenever she could decently do so, 
said, “I don’t know why they don’t 
announce the state as soon as they 
can, and then the county and so 
on. Then the people who were 
eliminated could relax.” 

“If they did anything like that,” 
pointed out Norman, “the politi- 
cians would follow the announce- 
ments like vultures. By the time it 
was narrowed down to a township, 
you’d have a Congressman or two 
at every street-comer.” 

Matthew narrowed his eyes and 
brushed angrily at his sparse, gray 
hair, “They’re vultures, anyhow. 
Listen — ” 

Sarah murmured, “Now, Fa- 
ther — ” 

Matthew’s voice rumbled over 
her protest without as much as a 
stumble or hitch. “Listen, I was 
around when they set up Multivac. 
It would end partisan politics, they 
said. No more voter’s money wasted 
on campaigns. No more grinning 
nobodies high-pressured and ad- 
vertising-campaigned into Con- 
gress or the White House. So what 
happens? More campaigning than 
ever, only now they do it blind. 
They’ll send guys to Indiana on 
account of the Hawkins-Smith Act 
and other guys to California in 
case it’s the Joe Hammer situation 
that turns crucial. I say, wipe out 
all that nonsense. Back to the good, 
old—” 

Linda asked, suddenly, “Don’t 
you want Daddy to vote this year, 
Grandpa?” 

Matthew glared at the young 
girl. “Never you mind now.” He 
turned back to Norman and Sarah. 
“There was a time I voted. 
Marched right up to the polling 
booth, stuck my fist on the levers 
and voted. There was nothing to 
it. I just said: This fellow’s my 
man and I’m voting for him. 
That's the way it should be.” 
Linda said excitedly, “You voted, 
Grandpa? You really did?” 

Sarah leaned forw^ird quickly 
to quiet what might easily become 
an incongruous story drifting about 
the neighborhood. “It’s nothing, 
Linda. Grandpa doesn’t really 
mean voted. When he was a little 
boy, they had something they 
called voting. Everyone did that 
kind of voting, Grandpa, too, but 
it wasn’t really voting.” 

Matthew roared, “It wasn’t 
when I was a little boy. I was 22 
and I voted for Langley and it was 
real voting. My vote didn’t count 
for much, maybe, but it was as 
good as anyone else’s. Anyone else’s. 
And no Multi vac to — ” 

Norman interposed. “All right, 
Linda, time for bed. And stop ask- 
ing questions about voting. When 
you grow up, you’ll understand 
all about it.” 

He kissed her with antiseptic 
gentleness and she moved reluc- 
tantly out of range under maternal 
prodding and a promise that she 
might watch the bedside video till 
9:15, if she was prompt about the 
bathing ritual. 

Linda said, “Grandpa,” and 
stood with her chin down and her 
hands behind her back until his 
newspaper lowered itself to the 
point where shaggy eyebrows and 
eyes, nested in fine wrinkles, 
showed themselves. It was Friday, 
October 31. 

He said, “Yes?” 

Linda came closer and put both 
her forearms on one of the old 
man’s knees so that he had to dis- 
card his newspaper altogether. 

She said, “Grandpa, did you 
really once vote?” 

He said, “You heard me say I 
did, didn’t you? Do you think I tell 
fibs?” 

“N — no, but Mamma says every- 
body voted then.” 

“So they did.” 

“But how could they? How could 
everybody vote?” 

Matthew stared at her solemnly, 
then lifted her and put her on his 
knee. 

He even moderated the tonal 
qualities of his voice. He said, “You 
see, Linda, till about forty years 
ago, everybody always voted. Say 
we wanted to decide who was to 
be the new President of the United 
States. The Democrats and Repub- 
licans would both nominate some- 
one and everybody would say who 
they wanted. When Election Day 
was over, they would count how 
many people wanted the Democrat 
and how many wanted the Repub- 
lican. Whoever had more votes 
was elected. You see?” 

Linda nodded and said, “How 
did all the people know who to 
vote for? Did Multivac tell them?” 
Matthew’s eyebrows hunched 
down and he looked severe. “They 
just used their own judgment, girl.” 
She edged away from him and 
he lowered his voice again, “I’m 
not angry at you, Linda. But, you 
see, sometimes it took all night to 
count what everyone said and peo- 
ple were impatient. So they in- 
vented special machines which 
could look at the first few votes 
and compare them with the votes 
from the same places in previous 
years. That way the machine could 
compute how the total vote would 
be and who would be elected. You 
see?” 

She nodded. “Like Multivac.” 
“The first computers were much 
smaller than Multivac. But the 
machines grew bigger and they 
could tell how the election would 
go from fewer and fewer votes. 
Then, at last, they built Multivac 
and it can tell from just one voter.” 
Linda smiled at having reached 
a familiar part of the story and 
said, “That’s nice.” 

Matthew frowned and said, “No, 
it’s not nice. I don’t want a ma- 
chine telling me how I would have 
voted just because some joker in 
Milwaukee says he’s against higher 
tariffs. Maybe I want to vote 
cockeyed just for the pleasure of 
it. Maybe I don’t want to vote. 
Maybe — ” 

But Linda had wriggled from his 
knee and was beating a retreat. 

She met her mother at the door. 
Her mother, who was still wearing 
her coat and had not even had 
time to remove her hat, said 
breathlessly, “Run along, Linda. 
Don’t get in mother’s way.” 

Then she said to Matthew as 
she lifted her hat from her head 
and patted her hair back into 
place, “I’ve been at Agatha’s.” 
Matthew stared at her censo- 
riously and did not even dignify 
that piece of information with a 
grunt as he groped for his news- 
paper. 

Sarah said, as she unbuttoned her 
coat, “Guess what she said?” 
Matthew flattened out his news- 
paper for reading purposes with a 
sharp crackle and said, “Don’t 
much care.” 

Sarah said, “Now, Father — ” 
But she had no time for anger. 
The news had to be told and Mat- 
thew was the only recipient handy. 
So she went on, “Agatha’s Joe is 
a policeman, you know, and he 
says a whole truckload of secret 
service men came into Blooming- 
ton last night.” 

“They’re not after me.” 

“Don’t you see. Father? Secret 
service agents, and it’s almost elec- 
tion time. In Bloomington!’^ 

“Maybe they’re after a bank 
robber.” 

“There hasn’t been a bank rob- 
bery in town in ages . Father, 
you’re hopeless.” 

She stalked away. 

Nor did Norman Muller receive 
the news with noticeably greater 
excitement. 

“Now, Sarah, how did Agatha’s 
Joe know they were secret service 
agents,” he asked, calmly. “They 
wouldn’t go around with identi- 
fication cards pasted on their fore- 
heads.” 

But by next evening, with No- 
vember a day old, she could say 
triumphantly, “It’s just everyone 
in Bloomington that’s waiting for 
someone local to be the voter. The 
Bloomington News as much as said 
so on video.” 

Norman stirred uneasily. He 
couldn’t deny it, and his heart was 
sinking. If Bloomington was really 
to be hit by Multivac’s lightning, it 
would mean newspapermen, video 
shows, tourists, all sorts of — strange 
upset. Norman liked the quiet rou- 
tine of his life and the distant stir 
of politics was getting uncomfort- 
ably close. 

He said, “It*s all rumor. Nothing 
more.” 

“You wait and see, then. You 
just wait and see.” 

As things turned out, there was 
very little time to wait, for the 
door-bell rang insistently, and when 
Norman Muller opened it and 
said, “Yes?” a tall, grave-faced 
man said, “Are you Norman Mul- 
ler?” 

Norman said, “Yes” again, but 
in a strange dying voice. It was 
not difficult to see from the stran- 
ger’s bearing that he was one car- 
rying authority and the nature of 
his errand suddenly became as in- 
evitably obvious as it had, until the 
moment before, been unthinkably 
impossible. 

The man presented credentials, 
stepped into the house, closed the 
door behind him and said ritualis- 
tically, “Mr. Norman Muller, it 
is necessary for me to inform you 
on the behalf of the President of 
the United States that you have 
been chosen to represent the 
American electorate on Tuesday, 
November 4, 2008.” 

N orman MULLER managed, 
with difficulty, to walk un- 
aided to his chair. He sat there, 
white-faced and almost insensible, 
while Sarah brought water, slapped 
his hands in panic and moaned to 
her husband between clenched 
teeth, “Don’t be sick, Norman. 
DonH be sick. They’ll pick some- 
one else.” 

When Norman could manage to 
talk, he whispered, “I’m sorry, 
sir. 

The secret service agent had re- 
moved his coat, unbuttoned his 
jacket and was sitting at esise on 
the couch. 

“It’s all right,” he said, and the 
mark of officialdom seemed to have 
vanished with the formal an- 
nouncement and leave him simply 
a large and rather friendly man. 
“This is the sixth time I’ve made 
the announcement and I’ve seen 
all kinds of reactions. Not one of 
them was the kind you see on the 
video. You know what I mean? A 
holy, dedicated look, and a charac- 
ter who says: Tt will be a great 
privilege to serve my country.’ 
That sort of stuff.” The agent 
laughed comfortingly. 

Sarah’s accompanying laugh 
held a trace of shrill hysteria. 

The agent said, “Now you’re go- 
ing to have me with you for a 
while. My name is Phil Handley. 
I’d appreciate it if you call me 
Phil. Mr. Muller can’t leave the 
house any more till Election Day. 
You’ll have to inform the depart- 
ment store that he’s sick, Mrs. Mul- 
ler. You can go about your busi- 
ness for a while but you’ll have to 
agree not to say a word about this. 
Right, Mrs. Muller?” 

Sarah nodded vigorously. “No, 
sir. Not a word.” 

“All right. But, Mrs. Muller,” 
Handley looked grave, “we’re not 
kidding now. Go out only if you 
must and you’ll be followed when 
you do. I’m sorry but that’s the 
way we must operate.” 

“Followed?” 

“It won’t be obvious. Don’t wor- 
ry. And it’s only for two days till 
the formal announcement to the 
nation is made. Your daughter — ” 

“She’s in bed,” said Sarah, 
hastily. 

“Good. She’ll have to be told I’m 
a relative or friend staying with 
the family. If she does find out the 
truth, she’ll have to be kept in 
the house. Your father had better 
stay in tlfe house in any case.” 

“He won’t like that,” said Sarah. 

“Can’t be helped. Now, since 
you have no odiers living with 
you — ” 

“You know all about us, ap- 
parently,” whispered Norman. 

“Quite a bit,” agreed Handley. 
“In any case, those are all my in- 
structions to you for the moment. 
I’ll try to co-operate as much as 
I can and be as little of a nuisance 
as possible. The government will 
pay for my maintenance so I won’t 
be an expense to you. I’ll be re- 
lieved each night by someone who 
will sit up in this room, so there 
will be no problem about sleeping 
accommodations. Now, Mr. Mul- 
ler—” 

“Sir?” 

“You can call me Phil,” said 
the agent again. “The purpose of 
the two days preliminary to formal 
announcement is to get you used 
to your position. We prefer to have 
you face Multivac in as normal a 
state of mind as possible. Just re- 
lax and try to feel this is all in a 
day’s work. Okay?” 

“Okay,” said Norman, and then 
shook his head violently. “But I 
don’t want the responsibility. Why 
me?” 

“All right,” said Handley, “let’s 
get that straight to begin with. 
Multivac weighs all sorts of known 
factors, billions of them. One factor 
isn’t known, though, and won’t be 
known for a long time. That’s the 
reaction pattern of the human 
mind. All Americans are subjected 
to molding pressure of what other 
Americans do and say, to the things 
that are done to him and the things 
he does to others. Any American 
can be brought to Multivac to 
have the bent of his mind surveyed. 
From that the bent of all other 
minds in the country can be esti- 
mated. Some Americans are better 
for the purpose than others at some 
given time, depending upon the 
happenings of diat year. Multivac 
picked you as most representative 
this year. Not the smartest, or the 
strongest, or the luckiest, but just 
the most representative. Now we 
don’t question Multivac, do we?” 

“Couldn’t it make a mistake?” 
asked Norman. 

Sarah, who listened impatiently, 
interrupted to say, “Don’t listen to 
him, sir. He’s just nervous, you 
know. Actually, he’s very well-read 
and he always follows politics very 
closely.” 

Handley said, “Multivac makes 
the decisions, Mrs. Muller. It 
picked your husband.” 

“But does it know everything?” 
insisted Norman, wildly. “Can’t it 
have made a mistake?” 

“Yes, it can. There’s no point in 
not being frank. In 1993, a selected 
Voter died of a stroke two hours 
before it was time for him to be 
notified. Multivac didn’t predict 
that; it couldn’t. A Voter might 
be mentally unstable, morally un- 
suitable, or, for that matter, dis- 
loyal. Multivac can’t know every- 
thing about everybody until he’s 
fed all the data there is. That’s why 
alternate selections are always held 
in readiness. I don’t think we’ll be 
using one this time. You’re in good 
health, Mr. Muller, and you’ve 
been carefully* investigated. You 
qualify.” 

Norman buried his face in his 
hands and sat motionless, 

“By tomorrow morning, sir,” said 
Sarah, “he’ll be perfectly all right. 
He just has to get used to it, that’s 
all.” 

“Of course,” said Handley. 

In the privacy of their bed- 
chamber, Sarah Muller expressed 
herself in stronger fashion. The 
burden of her lecture was, “So get 
hold of yourself, Norman. You’re 
trying to throw away the chance 
of a lifetime.” 

Norman whispered, desperately, 
“It frightens me, Sarah. The whole 
thing.” 

“For goodness sake, why? What’s 
there to it but answering a question 
or two?” 

“The responsibility is too great. 
I couldn’t face it.” 

“What responsibility? There 
isn’t any. Multivac picked you. It’s 
Multivac’s responsibility. Everyone 
knows that.” 

Norman sat up in bed in a sud- 
den access of rebellion and anguish. 
“Everyone is supposed to know 
that. But they don’t. They — ” 

“Lower your voice,” hissed 
Sarah, icily. “They’ll hear you 
downtown.” 

“They don’t,” said Norman, de- 
clining quickly to a whisper. “ When 
they talk about the Ridgely ad- 
ministration of 1988, do they say 
that Ridgely was corrupt and the 
nation was foolish to elect him? 
Do they say he won them over with 
pie-in-the-sky promises and racist 
baloney? No! They talk about the 
‘goddam MacComber vote’ as 
though Humphrey MacComber 
was the only man who had any- 
thing to do with it because he 
faced Multivac. I’ve said it my- 
self — only now I think, the poor 
guy was just a truck-farmer who 
didn’t ask to be picked. Why was 
it his fault more than anyone else’s. 
Now his name is a curse.” 

“You’re just being childish,” 
said Sarah. 

“I’m being sensible. I tell you, 
Sarah, I won’t accept. They can’t 
make me vote if I don’t want to. 
I’ll say I’m sick. I’ll say—” 

But Sarah had had enough. 
“Now you listen to me,” she whis- 
pered in a cold fury. “You don’t 
have only yourself to think about. 
You know what it means to be 
Voter of the Year. A Presidential 
year at that. It means publicity and 
fame and, maybe, buckets of 
money — ” 

“And then I go back to being 
a clerk.” 

“You will not. You’ll have a 
branch managership at the least 
if you have any brains at all, and 
you will have, because I’ll tell you 
what to do. You control the kind 
of publicity if you play your cards 
right, and you can force Kennell 
Stores, Inc. into a tight contract 
and an escalator clause in connec- 
tion with your salary and z, decent 
pension plan.” 

“That’s not the point in being 
Voter, Sarah.” 

“That will be your point. If you 
don’t owe anything to yourself or 
to me — I’m not asking for myself 
— ^you owe something to Linda.” 

Norman groaned. 

“Well, don’t you?” snapped 
Sarah. 

“Yes, dear,” murmured Norman. 

On November 3, the official an- 
nouncement was made and it was 
too late for Norman to back out 
even if he had been able to find 
the courage to make the attempt. 

Their house was sealed off. Se- 
cret service agents made their ap- 
pearance in the open, blocking off 
all approach. 

At first the telephone rang in- 
cessantly, but Philip Handley with 
an engagingly apologetic smile took 
all calls. Eventually, the exchange 
shunted all calls directly to the po- 
lice station. 

Noiman imagined that in that 
way, he was spared not only the 
bubbling (and envious?) congratu- 
lations of friends, but also the egre- 
gious pressure of salesmen scenting 
a prospect and the designing 
smoothness of politicians from all 
over the nation. Perhaps even 
death threats from the inevitable 
cranks. 

Newspapers were forbidden to 
the house now in order to keep out 
weighted pressure and television 
was gently but firmly disconnected, 
over Linda’s loud protests. 

Matthew growled and stayed in 
his room; Linda, after the first 
flurry of excitement, sulked and 
whined because she could not leave 
the house; Sarah divided her time 
between preparation of meals for 
the present and plans for the fu- 
ture; and Norman’s depression 
lived and fed upon itself. 

And the morning of Tuesday, 
November 4, 2008, came at last 
and it was Election Day. 

r r WAS EARLY breakfast, but 
only Norman Muller ate, and 
that mechanically. Even a shower 
and shave had not succeeded in 
either restoring him to reality or 
removing his own conviction that 
he was as grimy without as he 
felt grimy within. 

Handley’s friendly voice did its 
best to shed some normality over 
the gray and unfriendly dawn. 
(The weather prediction had been 
for a cloudy day with prospects 
of rain before noon.) 

Handley said, “We’ll keep this 
house insulated till Mr. Muller is 
back, but after that we’ll be off 
your necks.” The secret service 
agent was in full uniform now, in- 
cluding side-aums in heavily- 
brassed holsters. 

“You’ve been no trouble at all, 
Mr. Handley,” simpered Sarah. 

Norman drank through two cups 
of black coffee, wiped his lips with 
a napkin, stood up and said, hag- 
gardly, “I’m ready.” 

Handley stood up, too, “Very 
well, sir. And thank you, Mrs. 
Muller, for your very kind hos- 
pitality.” 

The armored car purred down 
empty streets. They were empty 
even for that hour of the morning. 

Handley indicated that and said, 
“They always shift traffic away 
from the line of drive ever since 
the attempted bombing that nearly 
ruined the Leverett election of 
’ 92 .” 

When the car stopped, Norman 
was helped oiit by the always 
polite Handley into an under- 
ground drive whose walls were lined 
with soldiers at attention. 

He was led into a brightly lit 
room, in which three white-uni- 
formed men greeted him smilingly. 

Norman said, sharply, “But this 
is the hospital?” 

“There’s no significance to that,” 
said Handley, at once. “It’s just 
that the hospital has the necessary 
facilities.” 

“Well, what do I do?” 

Handley nodded. One of the 
three men in white advanced and 
said, “I’ll take over now, agent.” 

Handley saluted in an ofT-hand 
manner and left the room. 

The man in white said, “Won’t 
you sit down, Mr. Muller? I’m 
John Paulson, Senior Computer. 
These are Samson Levine and Peter 
Dorogobuzh, my assistants.” 

Norman numbly shook hands all 
around. Paulson was a man of mid- 
dle height with a soft face that 
seemed used to smiling and a very 
obvious toupee. He wore plastic- 
rimmed glasses of an old-fashioned 
cut, and he lit a cigarette as he 
talked. (Norman refused his offer 
of one.) 

Paulson said, “In the first place, 
Mr. Muller, I want you to know 
we are in no hurry. We want you 
to stay with us all day if necessary, 
just so that you get used to your 
surroundings and get over any 
thought you might have that there 
is anything unusual in this, any- 
thing clinical, if you know what I 
mean.” 

“It’s all right,” said Norman. 
“I’d just as soon this were over.” 

“I understand your feelings. Still, 
we want you to know exactly what’s 
going on. In the first place, Mul- 
tivac isn’t here.” 

“It isn’t?” Somehow through all 
his depression, he had still looked 
forward to seeing Multivac. They 
said it was half a mile long and 
three stories high, that fifty tech- 
nicians walked the corridors within 
its structure continuously. It was 
one of the wonders of the world. 

Paulson smiled. “No. It’s not 
portable, you know. It’s located un- 
derground, in fact, and very few 
people know exactly where. You 
can understand that, since it is our 
greatest natural resource. Believe 
me, elections aren’t the only thing 
it’s used for.” 

Norman thought he was being 
deliberately chatty, but found him- 
self intrigued all the same. “I 
thought I’d see it. I’d like to.” 

“I’m sure of that. But it takes a 
Presidential order and even then 
it has to be countersigned by Se- 
curity. However, we are plugged 
into Multivac right here by beam 
transmission. What Multivac says 
can be interpreted here and what 
we say is beamed directly to Mul- 
tivac, so in a sense we’re in its 
presence.” 

Norman looked about. The ma- 
chines within the room were all 
meaningless to him. 

“Now let me explain, Mr. Mul- 
ler,” Paulson went on. “Multivac 
already has most of the information 
it needs to decide all the elections, 
national, state and local. It needs 
only to check certain imponderable 
attitudes of mind and it will use 
you for that. We can’t predict what 
questions it will ask, but they may 
not make much sense to you, or 
even to us. It may ask you how you 
feel about garbage-disposal in your 
town; whether you favor central 
incinerators. It might ask you 
whether you have a doctor of your 
own or whether you make use of 
National Medicine, Inc. Do you 
understand?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Whatever it asks, you answer 
in your own words in any way you 
please. If you feel you must explain 
quite a bit, do so. Talk an hour, if 
necessary.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Now, one more thing. We will 
have to make use of some simple 
devices which will automatically 
record your blood pressure, heart 
beat, slan conductivity and brain 
wave pattern while you speak. The 
machinery will seem formidable, 
but it’s all absolutely painless. You 
won’t even know it’s going on. So 
don’t worry about it.” 

The other two technicians were 
already busying themselves with 
smooth-gleaming apparatus on 
oiled wheels. 

Norman said, “Is that to check 
on whether I’m lying or not?” 

“Not at all, Mr. Muller. There’s 
no question of lying. It’s only a 
matter of emotional intensity. If 
the machine asks you your opinion 
of your child’s school, you may say, 
T think it is overcrowded.’ Those 
are only words. From the way your 
brain and heart and hormones and 
sweat glands work, Multivac can 
judge exactly how intensely you 
feel about the matter. It will un- 
derstand your feelings better than 
you yourself.” 

“I never heard of this,” said 
Norman. 

“No, I’m sure you didn’t. Most 
of the details of Multivac’s work- 
ings are top secret. For instance, 
when you leave, you will be asked 
to sign a paper swearing that you 
will never reveal the nature of the 
questions you were asked, the na- 
ture of your responses, what was 
done, or how it was done. The less 
is known about the Multivac, the 
less chance of attempted outside 
pressures upon the men who serv- 
ice it.” He smiled, grimly, “Our 
lives are hard enough as it is.” 
Norman nodded. “I under- 
stand.” 

“And now would you like any- 
thing to eat or drink?” 

“No. Nothing right now.” 

“Do you have any questions?” 
Norman shook his head. 

“Then you tell us when you’re 
ready.” 

“I’m ready right now.” 

“You’re certain there’s nothing 
else you want to ask?” 

“Quite.” 

Paulson nodded, and raised his 
hand in a gesture to the others. 

They advanced with their fright- 
ening equipment and Norman 
Muller felt his breath come a little 
more quickly and his heart beat 
more rapidly as he watched. 
The ordeal lasted nearly 
three hours, with one short 
break for coffee and an embarrass- 
ing session with a chamber-pot. 
During all this time, Norman Mul- 
ler remained encased in machinery. 
He was bone- weary at the close. 

He thought sardonically that his 
promise to reveal nothing of what 
had passed would be an easy one 
to keep. Already the questions were 
a hazy mish-mash in his mind. 

Somehow he had thought Mul- 
tivac would speak in a sepulchral, 
superhuman voice, resonant and 
echoing, but that, he now decided, 
was just an idea he had from see- 
ing too many television shows. The 
truth was distressingly undramatic. 
The questions were slips of a kind 
of metallic foil patterned with nu- 
merous punctures. A second ma- 
chine converted the pattern into 
words and Paulson read the words 
to Norman, then gave him the 
question and let him read it for 
himself. 

Norman’s answers were taken 
down by a recording machine, 
played back to Norman for con- 
firmation, with emendations and 
added remarks also taken down. 
All that was fed into a pattern- 
making instrument and that, in 
turn, was radiated to Multivac. 

The one question Norman could 
remember at the moment was an 
incongruously gossipy: “What do 
you think of the price of eggs?” 
He had answered, blankly, “I 
don’t know the price of eggs.” 
Now it was over, and gently they 
removed the electrodes from vari- 
ous portions of his body, un- 
wrapped the pulsating band from 
his upper arm, moved the machin- 
ery away. 

He stood up, drew a deep, shud- 
dering breath and said, “Is that 
all? Am I through?” 

“Not quite,” Paulson hurried to 
him, smiling in reassuring fashion. 
“We’ll have to ask you to stay 
another hour.” 

“Why?” asked Norman, sharply. 
“It will take that long for Mul- 
tivac to weave the new data into 
the trillions of items it has. Thou- 
sands of elections are concerned, 
you know. It’s very complicated. 
And it may be that an odd contest 
here or there, a comptrollership in 
Phoenix, Arizona, or some council 
seat in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, 
may be in doubt. In that case, 
Multivac may be compelled to ask 
you a deciding question or two.” 
“No,” said Norman. “I won’t go 
through this again.” 

“It probably won’t happen,” 
Paulson said, soothingly. “It rarely 
does. But just in case, you’ll have 
to stay.” A touch of steel, just a 
touch, entered his voice. “You have 
no choice, you know. You must.” 
Norman sat down wearily. He 
shrugged. 

Paulson said, “We can’t let you 
read a newspaper, but if you’d care 
for a murder mystery, or if you’d 
like to play chess, or if there’s any- 
thing we can do for you to help 
pass the time, I wish you’d men- 
tion it.” 

“It’s all right. I’ll just wait.” 
They ushered him into a small 
room just next to the one in which 
he had been questioned. He let 
himself sink into a plastic covered 
armchair and closed his eyes. 

As well as he could, he must 
wait out this final hour. 

He sat perfectly still and slowly 
the tension left him. His breathing 
grew less ragged and he could clasp 
his hands without being quite so 
conscious of the trembling of his 
fingers. 

Maybe there would be no ques- 
tions. Maybe it was all over. 

If it were over, then the next 
thing would be torchlight proces- 
sions and invitations to speak at 
all sorts of functions. The Voter 
of the Year! 

He, Norman Muller, ordinary 
clerk of a small department store in 
Bloomington, Indiana, who had 
neither been bom great nor 
achieved greatness would be in 
the extraordinary position of hav- 
ing had greatness thrust upon him. 

The historians would speak 
soberly of the Muller Election of 
2008. That would be its name, the 
Muller Election! 

The publicity, the better job, 
the flash flood of money that in- 
terested Sarah so much, occupied 
only a corner of his mind. It would 
all be welcome, of course. He 
couldn’t refuse it. But at the mo- 
ment something else was begin- 
ning to concern him. 

A latent patriotism was stirring. 
After all, he was representing the 
entire electorate. He was the focal 
point for them. He was, in his own 
person, for this one day, all of 
America! 

The door opened, snapping him 
to open-eyed attention. For a mo- 
ment, his stomach constricted. Not 
more questions! 

But Paulson was smiling. “That 
will be all, Mr. Muller.” 

“No more questions, sir?” 

“None needed. Everything was 
quite clearcut. You will be es- 
corted back to your home and then 
you will be a private citizen once 
more. Or as much so as the public 
will allow.” 

“Thank you. Thank you.” Nor- 
man flushed and said, “I wonder 
— Who was elected?” 

Paulson shook his head. “That 
will have to wait for the official 
announcement. The rules are quite 
strict. We can’t even tell you. You 
understand.” 

“Of course. Yes.” Norman felt 
embarrassed. 

“Secret Service will have the 
necessary papers for you to sign.” 

“Yes.” Suddenly, Norman Mul- 
ler felt proud. It was on him now 
in full strength. He was proud. 

In this imperfect world, the 
sovereign citizens of the first and 
greatest Electronic Democracy had, 
through Norman Muller (through 
him! ) exercised once again its free, 
untrammeled franchise. • • •
