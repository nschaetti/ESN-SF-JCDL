Ideas Die Hard.

The technical problems had been solved long 
ago, but now the ultimate question had to be 
answered — could men be sent to do Man’s job?

They strapped them in 
against the acceleration of 
takeoff, surrounded their 
cleverly designed seats with fluid 
and fortified their bodies with 
drugs. 

Then, when the time came that 
the straps might be unhooked, 
they were left with little more 
space than before. 

The single light garment each 
wore gave an illusion of freedom, 
but only an illusion. They might 
move their arms freely, but their 
legs just to a limited extent. Only 
one at a time could be completely straightened, not both at once. 

They could shift position into a 
half recline to the right or left, 
but they could not leave their 
seats. The seats were all there 
were. They could eat, sleep, take 
care of all their bodily needs in 
a barely adequate way while sitting there, and they had to sit 
there. 

What it amounted to was that 
for a week (slightly more, actually) they were condemned to a 
tomb. At the moment, it didn’t 
matter that the tomb was surrounded by all of space. 

Acceleration was over and done 
with. They had begun the silent, 
even swoop through the space 
that separated Earth and Moon 
and there was a great horror upon 
them. 

Bruce G. Davis, Jr., said hollowly, “What do we talk about?” 

Marvin Oldbury said, “I don’t 
know.” There was silence again. 

They were not friends. Until 
recently, they had never even 
met. But they were imprisoned 
together. Each had volunteered. 
Each had met the requirements. 
They were single, intelligent and 
in good health. 

Moreover, each had undergone extensive psychotherapy for 
months beforehand. 

And the great advice of the 
psych-boys had been — talk! 

“Talk continuously, if necessary,” they had said. “Don’t let 
yourself start feeling alone.” 

O LDBURY said, “How do they 
know?” He was the taller 
and larger of the two, strong and 
square-faced. There was a tuft of 
hair just over the bridge of his 
nose that made a period between 
two dark eyebrows. 

Davis was sandy-haired and 
freckled, with a pugnacious grin 
and the beginnings of shadows 
beneath his eyes. It might be 
those shadows that seemed to 
fill his eyes with foreboding. 

He said, “How do who know?” 
“The psychs. They say talk. 
How do they know it will do any 
good?” 

“What do they care?” asked 
Davis sharply. “It’s an experiment. If it doesn’t work, they’ll 
tell the next pair: ‘Don’t say a 
word.’ ” 

Oldbury stretched out his arms 
and the fingers touched the great 
semisphere of information devices that surrounded them. He 
could move the controls, handle 
the air-conditioning equipment, 
tweak the plastic tubes out of 
which they could suck the bland 
nutrient mixture, nudge the 
waste-disposal unit, and brush 
the dials that controlled the viewscope. 

All was bathed in the mild 
glow of the lights which were fed 
by electricity from the solar batteries exposed on the hull of the 
ship to sunlight that never failed. 

Thank heaven, he thought, for 
the spin that had been given the 
vessel. It produced a centrifugal 
force that pressed him down in 
his seat with the feel of weight. 
Without that touch of gravity to 
make it seem like Earth, it could 
not have been borne. 

Still, they might have made 
space within the ship, space that 
they could spare from the needs 
of equipment and use for the 
the tight in-packing of two men. 

He put the thought into words 
and said, “They might have allowed for more room.” 

“Why?” asked Davis. 

“So we could stand up.” 

Davis grunted. It was really all 
the answer that could be made. 

Oldbury said, “Why did you 
volunteer?” 

“You should have asked me 
that before we left. I knew then. 
I was going to be one of the first 
men around the Moon and back. 
I was going to be a big hero at 
twenty-five. Columbus and I, you 
know.” He turned his head from 
side to side restlessly, then sucked 
a moment or two at the watertube. He said, “But just the same. 
I’ve wanted to back out for two 
months. Each night I went to bed 
sweating, swearing I would resign in the morning.” 

“But you didn’t.” 

“No, I didn’t. Because I 
couldn’t. Because I was too yellow to admit I was yellow. Even 
when they were strapping me into 
this seat, I was all set to shout: 
‘No! Get someone else!’ I couldn’t, 
not even then.” 

Oldbury smiled without lightness. “I wasn’t even going to tell 
them. I wrote a note saying I 
couldn’t make it. I was going to 
mail it and disappear into the 
desert. Know where the note is 
now?” 

“Where?” 

“In my shirt pocket. Right 
here.” 

Davis said, “Doesn’t matter. 
When we come back, we’ll be 
heroes — big, famous, trembling 
heroes.” 

LARS NILSSON was a pale 
man with sad eyes and with 
prominent knuckles on his thin 
fingers. He had been civilian-in
charge of Project Deep Space fpr 
three years. He had enjoyed the 
job, all of it, even the tension and 
the failures — until now. Until 
the moment when two men had 
finally been strapped into place 
within the machine. 

He said, “I feel like a vivisectionist, somehow.” 

Dr. Godfrey Mayer, who 
headed the psychology group, 
looked pained. “Men have to be 
risked as well as ships. We’ve 
done what we could in the way 
of preparation and of safeguarding them as far as is humanly 
possible. After all, these men are 
volunteers.” 

Nilsson said colorlessly, “I 
know that.” The fact did not really comfort him. 

C taring at the controls, Oldbury wondered when, if ever, 
any of the dials would turn danger-red, when a warning ring 
would sound. 

They had been assured that, 
in all likelihood, this would not 
happen, but each had been 
thoroughly trained in the exact 
manner of adjustment, manually, 
of each control. 

And with reason. Automation 
had advanced to the point where 
the ship was a self-regulating organism, as self-regulating, almost, 
as a living thing. Yet three times, 
unmanned ships, almost as complicated 
as this one they were 
entombed in, had been sent out 
to follow a course boomeranging about the Moon, and three 
times, the ships had not returned. 

Furthermore, each time the information devices relaying data 
back to Earth had failed before 
even the Moon’s orbit had been 
reached on the forward journey. 

Public opinion was impatient 
and the men working on Project 
Deep Space voted not to wait on 
the success of an unmanned 
vehicle before risking human beings. It was decided that a 
manned vehicle was needed so 
that manual correction could be 
introduced to compensate for the 
small, cumulative failure of the 
imperfect automation. 

A crew of two men — they 
feared for the sanity of one man 
alone. 

Oldbury said, “Davis! Hey, 
Davis!” 

Davis stirred out of a withdrawn silence. “What?” 

“Let’s see what Earth looks 
like.” 

“Why?” Davis wanted to know. 

“Why not? We’re out here. 
Let’s enjoy the view, at least.” 

He leaned back. The viewscope 
was an example of automation. 
The impingement of short-wave 
radiation blanked it out. The Sun 
could not be viewed under any 
circumstances. Other than that, 
the viewscope oriented itself 
toward the brightest source of 
illumination in space, compensating, as it did so, for any proper 
motion of the ship, as the engineers had explained offhandedly. Little photo-electric cells located at four sides of the ship 
whirled restlessly, scanning the 
sky. And if the brightest lightsource was not wanted, there was 
always the manual control. 

Davis closed contact and the 
’scope was alive with light. He 
put out the room’s artificial lights 
and the view in the ’scope grew 
brighter against the contrast of 
darkness. 

It wasn’t a globe, of course, 
with continents on it. What they 
saw was a hazy mixture of white 
and blue-green filling the screen. 

The dial that measured distance from Earth, by determining 
the value of the gravitational 
constant, put them just under 
thirty thousand miles away. 

Davis said, “I’ll get the edge.” 
He reached out to adjust the 
sights and the view lurched. 

A curve of black swept in 
across the ’scope. There were no 
stars in it. 

Oldbury said, “It’s the night 
shadow.” 

•T^HE view moved jerkily back. 
-*• Blackness advanced from the 
other side and was curved more 
sharply and in the opposite sense. 
This time, the darkness showed 
the hard points of stars. 

Oldbury swallowed. “I wish I 
were back there,” he said 
solemnly. 

Davis said, “At least we can 
see the Earth is round.” 

“Isn’t that a discovery?” 

Davis seemed immediately 
stung at the manner in which 
Oldbury tossed off his remark. 
He said, “Yes, it is a discovery, 
if you put it that way. Only a 
small percentage of the Earth’s 
population has ever been convinced the Earth was round.” 

He put on ship’s lights, scowling, and doused the ’scope. 

“Not since 1500,” said Oldbury. 

“If you consider the New 
Guinea tribes, there were flatworld believers even in 1950. 
And there were religious sects 
in America as late as the 1930s 
who believed the Earth was flat. 
They offered prizes for anyone 
who could prove it was round. 
Ideas die hard!” 

“Crackpots,” Oldbury grunted. 
Davis grew warmer. He said, 
“Can you prove it’s round? I 
mean except for the fact that you 
see it is right now?” 

“You’re being ridiculous.” 
“Am I? Or were you just taking your fourth-grade teacher’s 
word as gospel? What proofs were 
you given? That the Earth’s 
shadow on the Moon during a 
lunar eclipse is round and that 
only a sphere can cast a round 
shadow? That’s plain nonsense! 
A circular disc can cast a round 
shadow. So can an egg or any 
shape, however irregular, with 
one circular projection. Would 
you point out that men have 
traveled around the Earth? 
They might just be circling the 
central point of a flat Earth at a 
fixed distance. It would have the 
same effect. Do ships appear topfirst on the horizon? Optical illusion, for all you know. There 
are queerer ones.” 

“Foucault’s pendulum,” said 
Oldbury briefly. He was taken 
aback at the other man’s intensity. 

Davis said, “You mean a pendulum staying in one plane and 
that plane revolving as Earth 
moves under it at a rate depending on the latitude of the place 
where the experiment is being 
performed. Sure! U a pendulum 
keeps to one plane. U the theories 
involved are correct. How does 
that satisfy the man in the street, 
who’s no physicist, unless he’s just 
willing to take the word of the 
physicists on faith? I tell you 
what! There was no satisfactory 
proof that the Earth was round 
till rockets flew high enough to 
take pictures of enough of the 
planet to show the curvature.” 

“Nuts,” said Oldbury. “The 
geography of Argentina would be 
all distorted if the Earth were flat 
with the North Pole as the center. 
Any other center would distort the geography of some other 
portion. The skin of the Earth 
just would not have the shape it 
has if it weren’t pretty nearly 
spherical. You can’t refute that.” 

Davis fell silent for a moment, 
then said sulkily, “What the devil 
are we arguing for, anyway? The 
hell with it.” 

SEEING Earth and talking 
^ about it, even just about its 
roundness, had driven Oldbury 
into a sharp nostalgia. He began 
to talk of home in a low voice. 
He talked about his youth in 
Trenton, New Jersey, and 
brought up anecdotes about his 
family that were so trivial that 
he had not thought of them in 
years, laughing at things that 
were scarcely funny and feeling 
the sting of childish pain he had 
thought healed over years before. 

At one point, Oldbury slipped 
off into shallow sleep, then woke 
with a start and was plunged in 
confusion at finding himself in 
a cold, blue-tinged light. Instinctively, he made to rise to his feet 
and sank back with a groan as 
his elbow struck metal hard. 

The ’scope was aglow again. 
The blue-tinged light that had 
startled him at the moment of 
waking was reflected from Earth. 

The curve of Earth’s rim was 
noticeably sharper now. They 
were 50,000 miles away. 

Davis had turned at the other’s 
sudden futile movement and said 
pugnaciously, “Earth’s roundness 
is no test. After all, Man could 
crawl over its surface and see its 
shape by its geography, as you 
said. But there are other places 
where we act as though we know 
and with less justification.” 

Oldbury rubbed his twinging 
elbow and said, “All right, all 
right.” 

Davis was not to be placated. 
“There’s Earth. Look at it. How 
old is it?” 

Oldbury said cautiously, “A few 
billion years, I suppose.” 

“You suppose? What right 
have you to suppose? Why not 
a few thousand years? Your 
great-grandfather probably believed Earth was six thousand 
years old, dating from Genesis 1. 
I know mine did. What makes 
you so sure they’re wrong?” 
“There’s a good deal of geological evidence involved.” 

“The time it takes for the 
ocean to grow as salt as it is? 
The time it takes to lay down a 
thickness of sedimentary rock? 
The time it takes to form a quantity of lead in uranium ore?” 
Oldbury leaned back in his 
seat and was watching the Earth 
with a kind of detachment. He 
scarcely heard Davis. A little 
more and they would see all of 
it in the ’scope. Already, with the 
planetary curve against space visible 
at one end of the ’scope, the 
night-shadow was about to encroach on the other. 

The night-shadow did not 
change its position, of course. The 
Earth revolved, but to the men 
aboard ship, it remained fat with 
light. 

“Well?” demanded Davis. 

“What?” said Oldbury, startled. 

“What about your damned geological evidence?” 

“Oh. Well, there’s uranium decay.” 

“I mentioned it. You’re a fool. 
Do you know that?” 

Oldbury counted ten to himself before replying, “I don’t think 
so.” 

“Then listen. Suppose the 
Earth had come into existence 
some six thousand years ago just 
as the Bible describes it. Why 
couldn’t it have been created then 
with a certain amount of lead already existing in the uranium? 
If the uranium could be created, 
why not the lead with it? Why 
not create the ocean as salt as it 
is and the sedimentary rocks as 
thick as they are? Why not create 
the fossils exactly as they exist?” 

“In other words, why not create 
the Earth complete with internal 
evidence proving that it is several 
billion years old?” 

“That’s right,” said Davis, “why 
not?” 

“Let me ask the opposite question. Why?” 



“I don’t care why. I’m just trying to show you that all the socalled proofs of Earth’s age don’t 
necessarily disprove Earth’s creation six thousand years ago.” 

LDBURY said, “I suppose 
you consider it all to be intended as a kind of game — a scientific puzzle to test mankind’s 
ingenuity, or exercise his mind — 
a mental jungle gym on his intellectual crib.” 

“You think you’re being funny, Oldbury, but actually what’s 
so damned impossible about it? 
It might be just that. You can’t 
prove it isn’t.” 

“I’m not trying to prove anything.” 

“No, you’re satisfied to take 
things as they’re handed to you. 
That’s why I said you were a 
fool. U we could go back in time 
and see for ourselves, then that 
would be another matter. If we 
could go back in time before 4004 
B.c. and see pre-dynastic Egypt, 
or earlier still and bag a sabertooth — ” 

“Or a tyrannosaur.” 

“Or a tyrannosaur, yes. Until 
we can do that, we can only 
speculate and there’s nothing to 
say where speculation is correct 
and where it isn’t. All science is 
based on faith in the original 
premises and in faith on the validity of deduction and induction.” 
“There’s no crime in that.” 

“There is crime!” said Davis 
vehemently. “You come to believe, and once you come to believe, you shut the doors of your 
mind. You’ve got your idea and 
you won’t replace it with another. 
Galileo found out how hard ideas 
can die.” 

“Columbus, too,” Oldbury put 
in drowsily. Staring at the bluetinged Earth with the slow 
whirling changes of the cloud 
formations had an almost hypnotic effect. 

Davis seized on his comment 
with an obvious glee. “Columbus! 

I suppose you think he maintained the Earth was round when 
everyone else thought it was flat.” 
“More or less.” 

“That’s the result of listening 
to your fourth-grade teacher, who 
listened to her fourth-grade teacher, and so on. Any intelligent and 
educated man in Columbus’s time 
would have been willing to concede that the Earth was round. 
The point at issue was the size 
of the Earth.” 

“Is that a fact?” 

“Absolutely. Columbus followed the maps of an Italian 
geographer which had the Earth 
about 15,000 miles in circumference, with the eastern edge of' 
Asia about three or four thousand 
miles from Europe. The geographers at the court of King John 
of Portugal insisted that this was 
wrong, that the Earth was about 
25,000 miles in circumference, 
that the eastern edge of Asia was 
about 12,000 miles west of the 
western edge of Europe, and that 
King John had better keep on 
trying for the route around 
Africa. The Portuguese geographers were, of course, a hundred 
per cent right and Columbus was 
a hundred per cent wrong. The 
Portuguese did reach India and 
Columbus never did.” 

Oldbury said, “He discovered 
America just the same. You can’t 
deny that fact.” 

“That had nothing to do with 
his ideas. It was strictly accidental. He was such an intellectual 
fraud that when his actual voyage showed his map was wrong, 
he falsified his log rather than 
change his ideas. His ideas died 
hard — they never died till he did, 
in fact. And so do yours. I could 
talk myself blue in the face and 
leave you still convinced that 
Columbus was a great man because he thought the Earth was 
round when everyone else said it 
was flat.” 

“Have it your way,” mumbled 
Oldbury. He was caught in lassitude and in the memory of the 
chicken soup his mother made 
when he was a child. She used 
barley. He remembered the smell 
of the kitchen on Saturday morning — french-toast morning — and 
the look of the streets after an 
afternoon of rain and the — 
ARS NILSSON had the 
transcripts before him, with 
the more significant portions 
marked off on the tape by the 
psychologists.' 

He said, “Are we still receiving 
them clearly?” 

He was assured that the receiving devices were working 
perfectly. 

“I wish there were some way 
to avoid listening to their conversations without their knowledge,” he said. “I suppose that’s 
foolish of me.” 

Godfrey Mayer saw no point in 
denying the other’s diagnosis. “It 
is,” he agreed. “Quite foolish. 
Look at it as merely additional 
information necessary to the 
study of human reaction to space. 
When we were testing human 
response to high-g acceleration, 
did you feel embarrassed to be 
caught looking at the recording 
of their blood-pressure variations?” 

“What do you make of Davis 
and his odd theories? He worries me.” 

Mayer shook his head. “We 
don’t know what we ought to be 
worried about as yet. Davis is 
working off aggressions against 
the science that has placed him 
in the position he finds himself 
in.” 

“That’s your theory?” 

“It’s one theory. Expressing the 
aggressions may be a good thing. 

It may keep him stable. And thep 
again, it may go too far. It’s too 
soon to tell. It may be that Oldbury is the one who’s in greater 
danger. He’s growing passive.” 
“Do you suppose, Mayer, that 
we may find that Man just isn’t 
suited for space? Any man?” 

If we could build ships that 
would carry a hundred men in an 
Earthlike environment, we’d have 
no trouble. As long as we build 
ships like this one — ” he jerked 
a thumb over his shoulder in a 
vague directional gesture — “we 
may have a great deal of trouble.” 
Nilsson felt vaguely dissatisfied. He said, “Well, they’re in 
their third day now and still safe 
so far.” 

* * * 

“WE’RE IN the third day now,” 
said Davis harshly. “We’re better than halfway there.” 

“Umm. I had a cousin who 
owned a lumber yard. Cousin 
Raymond. I used to visit him 
sometimes on the way home from 
school,” Oldbury reminisced. 

Unaccountably, his line of 
thought was interrupted by the 
fleeting memory of Longfellow’s 
The Village Blacksmith, and then 
he remembered that it contained 
a phrase about “the children coming home from school” and wondered how many people among 
those who rattled off so glibly, 
“Under the spreading chestnut 
tree, the village smithy stood” 
knew that the “smithy” was not 
the smith but the shop in which 
the smith worked. 

He asked, “What was I saying?” 

“I don’t know,” retorted Davis 
irritably. “I said we’re more than 
halfway there and we haven’t 
looked at the Moon yet.” 

“Let’s look at the Moon, then.” 
“All right, you adjust the 
’scope. I’ve done it long enough. 
Damn it, I’ve got blisters on my 
rump.” He moved jerkily in the 
enclosing confines of the bucket 
seat, as though to get a slightly 
new section of rear end in contact 
with cushioned metal. “I don’t 
know that it’s such a blasted fine 
idea to spin the damned ship and 
have gravity press us down. 
Floating a little would take the 
weight off and be relaxing.” 
“There’s no room to float,” 
sighed Oldbury, “and if we were 
in free fall, you’d be complaining of nausea.” 

Oldbury was working the controls of the ’scope as he spoke. 
Stars moved past the line of 
vision. 

TT WASN’T difficult. The en■*- gineers back home in Trenton 
— no, in New Mexico, really; on 
Earth, anyway — the engineers 
had schooled them carefully. Get 
it almost right. Get it pointed 
away from Earth, one hundred 
and eighty degrees. 

Once it is nearly right, then 
let the light meters take over. 
The Moon would be the brightest 
object in the vicinity and it would 
be centered in unstable equilibrium. It would take a few seconds for the meters to scan the 
rest of the sky and switch the 
’scope back to Earth, but in those 
few seconds, switch back to manuals and there, you have it. 

The Moon was crescent. It 
would have to be in opposite 
phase to Earth as long as the 
ship sped along a course that was 
almost on the line connecting the 
two worlds. 

But the crescent was a bloated 
one, as if it were part of a cheap 
calendar illustration. Oldbury 
thought there should be two 
heads, leaning toward one another, short straight hair against 
longer waved hair, silhouetted 
against the Moon. Except that it 
would have to be a full Moon. 

Davis snorted. “It’s there, at 
any rate.” 

“Did you expect it wouldn’t 
be?” 

“I don’t expect anything in 
space. Anything yes or anything 
no. No one’s been in space, so no 
one knows. But at least I see the 
Moon.” 

“You see it from Earth, if it 
comes to that.” 

“Don’t be so sure what you see 
from Earth. For all anyone can 
tell from Earth, the Moon is only 
a yellow painted patch on a bl6e 
background with a shade that’s 
drawn back and forth across it 
by clockwork.” 

“And stars and planets also run 
by clockwork?” 

“Same as they are in a planetarium. Why not? And a telescope 
shows more stars painted pn— ” 
“With a built-in red shift?” 
“Why not?” challenged Davis. 
“Only we’re halfway to the Moon 
and it looks bigger and maybe 
we’ll find it exists. I’ll reserve 
judgment on the other planets 
and the stars.” 

Oldbury looked at the Moon 
and sighed. In a few days, they 
would be edging around it, moving past and over the hidden side. 

He said, “I never did believe 
the story about the man in the 
Moon. I never saw him. What I 
saw was the face of a woman — 
two eyes, rather lopsided, but 
very sad. I could see the full 
Moon from my bedroom window 
and she always made me feel sad, 
yet friendly, too. When clouds 
drifted past, it was the Moon — 
she — that always seemed to be 
moving, not the clouds, but still 
she didn’t go away from the window. And you could see her 
through the clouds, even though 
you could never see the Sun 
through clouds, not even through 
little clouds, and it was so much 
brighter. Why is that. Dad — uh 
- Davis?” 

Davis said, “What’s wrong with 
your voice?” 

“Nothing’s wrong with my 
voice.” 

“You’re squeaking.” 

Oldbury, with an effort of will, 
forced his voice an octave lower. 
“I’m not squeaking!” 

XTE STARED at the small 
clocks in the dashboard, two 
of them. It wasn’t the first time. 
One of them gave the time by 
Mountain Standard, and in that 
he wasn’t interested. It was the 
other, the one that measured the 
number of hours elapsed in flight, 
that caught at him periodically. 
It said sixty-four and a fraction, 
and in red, working backward, 
were the hours remaining before 
they were to land on Earth again. 
The red was marked off now at 

Ik 

one-hundred-forty-four and a fraction. 

Oldbury was sorry that the 
time left to go was recorded. He 
would have liked to work it out 
for himself. Back in Trenton, 
he used to count the hours to 
summer vacation, working it out 
painfully in his head during geography lesson — always geography 
lesson, somehow — so many days, 
then so many hours. He would 
write the result in tiny numbers 
in his exercise book. Each day 
the number would grow smaller. 
Half the excitement of approaching summer vacation was in 

watching those numbers grow 
smaller. 

But now the numbers grew 
smaller by themselves as the 
sweep second-hand went round 
and round, slicing time by minutes, paper-thin sections of time 
like corned-beef peeling off in 
the big sheer in the delicatessen. 

Davis’s voice impinged on his 
ear suddenly: “Nothing seems to 
be going wrong so far.” 

Oldbury said confidently, 
“Nothing will go wrong.” 

“What makes you so sure?” 
“Because the numbers just get 
smaller.” 

“Huh? How’s that again?” 

For a moment, Oldbury was 
confused. He said, “Nothing.” 

It was dim in the ship in the 
light of the crescent Moon only. 
He dipped into sleep again, skindiving fashion, half-conscious of 
the real Moon and half-dreaming 
of a full Moon at a window with 
a sad woman-face, being driven 
motionlessly by the wind. 

H= * * 

“TWO HUNDRED thousand 
miles,” said Davis. “That’s almost 
eighty-five per cent of the way 
there.” 

The lighted portion of the 
Moon was speckled and pimpled 
and its horns had outgrown the 
screen. Mare Crisium was a dark 
oval, distorted by the slanting 
view, but large enough to put a 
fist into. 

“And nothing wrong,” Davis 
went on. “Not one little red light 
on a single instrument dial.” 
“Good,” said Oldbury. 

“Good?” Davis looked about to 
stare at Oldbury and his eyes 
were squinting in suspicion. “In 
every previous try, nothing went 
wrong till they got out this far, 
so it’s not good yet.” 

“I don’t think anything will go 
wrong.” 

“I think it will. Earth isn’t supposed to know.” 

“Isn’t supposed to know what?” 
Davis laughed and Oldbury 
looked at him wearily. He felt 
queerly frightened at the other’s 
gathering monomania. Davis was 
not a bit like the father Oldbury 
remembered so queerly (only he 
remembered him younger than 
he was now, with all his hair and 
a sound heart. 

Davis’s profile was sharp in 
the moonlight. He said, “There 
may be a lot in space we’re not 
supposed to know. There’s a billion light-years ahead of us. Only, 
for all we know, there’s a solid 
black wall instead, just on the 
other side of the Moon, with stars 
painted on it and planets moving all squint-eyed so that smart 
cockerels on Earth can figure out 
all sorts of fancy orbits and 
theories of gravitation out of it.” 
“A game to test our minds?” 
said Oldbury. His memory 
brought that out of Davis’s previ
ous remarks — or were they his 
own? — with something of a 
wrench. This whole business with 
the ship seemed distant. 

“Why not?” 

“It’s all right,” Oldbury soothed 
anxiously. “It’s all right so far. 
Some day, you’ll see, it will be 
all right all the way out.” 

“Then why do every one of the 
recording devices go wrong past 
two hundred thousand miles? 
Why? Answer me that!” 

“We’re here this time. We’ll adjust them.” 

Davis said, “No, we won’t.” 

A SHARP memory of a story 
he had encountered in early 
teenhood stirred Oldbury into excitement. “You know, I once read 
a book about the Moon. The 
Martians had set up a base on 
the other side of the Moon. We 
could never see them, you see. 
They were hidden, but they could 
observe us — ” 

“How?” asked Davis sourly. 
“There was two thousand miles 
thickness of Moon between Earth 
and the other side.” 

“No. Let me start from the beginning.” Oldbury heard his voice 
go squeaky again, but he didn’t 
mind. He wanted to get out of 
his seat so he could jump up and 
down because just remembering 
the story made him feel good, 
but for some reason he couldn’t. 
“You see, it was in the future. 

and what Earth didn’t know 
was — ” 

“Will you shut up?” 

Oldbury’s voice cut off at the 
interruption. He felt hurt, stifled. 
Then he said, subdued, “You 
said Earth isn’t supposed to know 
and that’s why the instruments 
went off and the only new thing 
we’re going to see is the other 
side of the Moon and if the Martians — ” 

“Will you let up with your 
stupid Martians?” 

Oldbury fell silent. He was 
very resentful against Davis. Just 
because Davis was grown up 
didn’t make it all right for him 
to holler like that. 

His eyes drifted back to the 
clock. Summer vacation was only 
one hundred and ten hours away. 

THEY WERE falling toward the 
Moon now. Free fall. Speeding 
down at cataclysmic velocity. 
Moon’s gravity was weak, but 
they had fallen from a great 
height. And now, finally, the view 
on the Moon began to shift and, 
very slowly, new craters were 
coming into view. 

Of course, they would miss the 
Moon and their speed would 
sweep them safely around. They 
would move across half the 
Moon’s surface, across three 
thousand miles of it in one hour; 
then back they would hurl to 
meet the Earth once more. 

But Oldbury sadly missed the 
familiar face in the Moon. There 
was no face this close, only 
ragged surface. He felt his eyes 
brimming as he watched morosely. 

And then, suddenly, the small 
cramped room within the ship 
was full of loud buzzing and 
half the dials on the panel before them clamored into the red 
of disorder. 

Oldbury cowered back, but 
Davis howled in what seemed almost triumph. “I told you! Everything’s going wrong!” 

He worked at the manuals 
uselessly. “No information will get 
back. Secrets! Secrets!” 

But Oldbury still looked at 
the Moon. It was terribly close 
and now the surface was moving 
quickly. They were starting the 
swing in earnest and Oldbury’s 
scream was high-pitched. “Look! 
Lookathat!” His pointing finger 
was stiff with terror. 

Davis looked up and said, “Oh, 
God! Oh, God — ” over and over 
again, until finally the ’scope 
blanked out and the dials governing it showed red. 

L ars NILSSON could not 
really go paler than he was, 
but his hands trembled as they 
clenched into fists. 

“Again! It’s a damned jinx. For 
ten years, the automation hasn’t 
held out. Not on the unmanned 

flights. Not on this. Who’s responsible?” 

There was no use trying to fix 
responsibility. No one was responsible, as Nilsson admitted with a 
groan almost at once. It was just 
that at the crucial moment — once 
again — things had failed. 

“We’ve got to pull them 
through this somehow,” he said, 
knowing that the outcome was 
questionable now. 

Still, what could be done was 
being put into operation. 

❖ * * 

DAVIS SAID, “You saw that, too, 
didn’t you?” 

“I’m scared,” whimpered Oldbury. 

“You saw it. You saw the hidden side of the Moon as we went 
past and you saw there wasn’t 
any! Good Lord, just sticks, just 
big beams holding up six million 
square miles of canvas. I swear 
it, canvas!” 

He laughed wildly till he 
choked into breathlessness. 

Then he said hoarsely, “For a 
million years, mankind has been 
looking at the biggest false-front 
ever dreamed of. Lovers spooned 
under a world-size stretch of canvas and called it Moon. The stars 
are painted; they must be. If we 
could only get out far enough, 
we could scrape some off and 
carry them home. Oh, it’s funny.” He was laughing agin. 

Oldbury wanted to ask why the 

grownup was laughing. He couonly manage a “Why — why — ” 
because the other’s laughter was 
so wild that it froze the words 
into thick fright in his throat. 

Davis said, “Why? How the 
devil should I know why? Why 
does Television City build falsefront houses by the streetful for 
its shows? Maybe we’re a show, 
and the two of us have stumbled 
way out here where the gimcrack 
scenery is set up instead of being 
on stage-center where we’re supposed to be. Mankind isn’t supposed to know about the scenery, 
either. That’s why the information devices always go wrong past 
two hundred thousand miles. Of 
course, we saw it.” 

He looked crookedly at the 
big man beside him. “You know 
why it didn’t matter if we saw 
it?” 

Oldbury stared back out of his 
tear-stained face. “No. Why?” 
Davis said, “Because it doesn’t 
matter if we see it. If we get back 
to Earth and say that the Moon 
is canvas propped up by wood, 
they’d kill us. Or maybe lock us 
up in a madhouse for life if they 
felt kind-hearted. That’s why we 
won’t say a word about this.” 
His voice suddenly deepened 
with menace. “You understand? 
Not a word!” 

“I want my mother,” whined 
Oldbury plaintively. 

“Do you understand? We keep 

...et. It’s our only chance to be 
treated as sane. Let someone else 
come out and find out the truth 
and be slaughtered for it. Swear 
you’ll keep quiet! Cross your 
heart and hope to die if you tell 
them!” 

Davis was breathing harshly 
as he raised a threatening arm. 

Oldbury shrank back as far as 
his prison-seat would let him. 
“Don’t hit me. Don’t!” 

But Davis, past himself with 
fury, cried, “There’s only one safe 
way,” and struck at the cowering 
figure, and again, and again — 

^ ODFREY MAYER sat at 
Oldbury’s bedside and said, 
“Is it all clear to you?” Oldbury 
had been under observation for 
the better part of a month now. 

Lars Nilsson sat at the other 
end of the room, listening and 
watching. He remembered Oldbury as he had appeared before 
he had climbed into the ship. 
The face was still square, but 
the cheeks had fallen inward and 
the strength was gone from it. 

Oldbury’s voice was steady, but 
half a whisper. “It wasn’t a ship 
at all. We weren’t in space.” 

“Now we’re not just saying 
that. We showed you the ship 
and the controls that handled the 
images of the Earth and the 
Moon. You saw it.” 

“Yes. I know.” 

Mayer went on quietly, mat
ter-of-factly, “It was a dry run, a 
complete duplication of conditions to test how men would hold 
out. Naturally, you and Davis 
couldn’t be told this or the test 
would mean nothing. If things 
didn’t work out, we could stop 
it at any time. We could learn 
by experience and make changes, 
try again with a new pair.” 

He had explained this over and 
over again. Oldbury had to be 
made to understand if he was 
ever to learn to live a useful life 
again. 

“Has a new pair been tried 

yet?” asked Oldbury wisttu. 

“Not yet. They will be. Therd'are some changes to be made.” 

“I failed.” 

“We learned a great deal, so 
the experiment was a success in 
its way. Now listen — the controls 
of the ship were designed to go 
wrong when they did in order to 
test your reaction to emergency 
conditions after several days of 
travel strain. The breakdown was 
timed for the simulated swing 
about the Moon, which we were 
going to switch about so that you 
could see it from a new angle 
on the return trip. You weren’t 
intended to see the other side 
and so we didn’t build the other 
side. Call it economy. This test 
alone cost fifty million dollars 
and it’s not easy to get appropriations.” 

Nilsson added bitterly, “Except 
that the shut-off switch on the 
’scope didn’t shut off in time. A 
valve caught. You saw the unfinished back of the Moon and 
we had to stop the ship to prevent — ” 

“That’s it,” interrupted Mayer. 
“Now repeat it, Oldbury. Repeat 
everything.” 

^ I ' HEY walked down the corridor thoughtfully. Nilsson 
said, “He seemed almost himself 
again today. Don’t you think so?” 

“There’s improvement,” Mayer 
acknowledged. “A great deal. But 

j not through with therapy by 
^ny means.” 

Nilsson asked, “Any hope with 
Davis?” 

Mayer shook his head slowly. 
“That’s a different case. He’s completely withdrawn. Won’t talk. 
And that deprives us of any 
handle with which to reach him. 
We’ve tried aldosterone, ergot 
therapy, counter-electroencephalography and so on. No good. He 
thinks if he talks, we’ll put him 
in an institution or kill him. You 
couldn’t ask for a more developed paranoia.” 

“Have you told him we know?” 
“If we do, we’ll bring on a 
homicidal seizure again and we 
may not be as lucky as we were 
in saving Oldbury. I rather think 

he’s incurable. Sometimes, when 
the Moon is in the sky, the orderly tells me, Davis stares up 
at it and mutters, ‘Canvas,’ to 
himself.” 

Nilsson said soberly, “It reminds me of what Davis himself 
said in the early part of the trip. 
Ideas die hard. They do, don’t 
they?” 

“It’s the tragedy of the world. 
Only — ” Mayer hesitated. 

“Only what?” 

“Our unmanned rockets, three 
of them — the information devices 
on each stopped transmitting just 
before the boomerang swing and 
not one returned. Sometimes I just 
wonder—” 

“Shut up!” said Nilsson fiercely.
