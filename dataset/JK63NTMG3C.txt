By PHILIP K. DICK 

FAIR GAME 

No question of it, Douglas 
was a prize catch . btit by 
whom . and for what? 

PROFESSOR Anthony 

Douglas lowered grateful- 
ly into his red-leather easy 
chair and sighed. A long sigh, 
accompanied by labored re- 
moval of his shoes and numer- 
ous grunts as he kicked them 
into the corner. He folded his 
hands across his ample middle 
and lay back, eyes closed. 

“Tired?" Laura Douglas 
asked, turning from the kitch- 
en stove a moment, her dark 
eyes sympathetic. 

“You're darn right." Doug- 
las surveyed the evening 
paper across from him on the 
couch. Was it worth it? No, 
not really. He felt around in 
his coat pocket for his ciga- 
rettes and lit up slowly, lei- 
surely. “Yeah, I’m tired, all 
right. We’re starting a whole 
new line of research. Whole 
flock of bright young men in 
from Washington today. Brief 
cases and slide rules.” 

“Not—” 

“Oh, I’m still in charge.” 
Professor Douglas grinned 
expansively. “Perish the 
thought.” Pale gray cigarette 
smoke billowed around him. 
“It’ll be another few years be- 
fore they’re ahead of me. 
They’ll have to sharpen up 
their slide rules just a little 
bit more . .” 

His wife smiled and contin- 
ued preparing dinner. Maybe 
it was the atmosphere of the 
little Colorado town. The 
sturdy, impassive mountain 
peaks around them. The thin, 
chill air. The quiet citizens. In 
any case, her husband seemed 
utterly unbothered by the ten- 
sions and doubts that pres- 
sured other members of his 
profession. A lot of aggressive 
newcomers were swelling the 
ranks of nuclear physics these 
days. Old-timers were totter- 
ing in their positions, abrupt- 
ly insecure. Every college, 
every physics department and 
lab was being invaded by the 
new horde of skilled young 
men. Even here at Bryant 
College, so far off the beaten 
track. 

But if Anthony Douglas 
worried, he never let it show. 
He rested happily in his easy 
chair, eyes shut, a blissful 
smile on his face. He was tired 
— but at peace. He sighed 
again, this time more from 
pleasure than fatigue. 

“It’s true,” he murmured 
lazily. “I may be old enough to 
be their father, but I’m still a 
few jumps ahead of them. Of 
course, I know the ropes bet- 
ter. And—” 

“And the wires. The ones 
worth pulling.” 

“Those, too. In any case, 1 
think I’ll come off from this 
new line we’re doing just 
about ...” 

His voice trailed off. 

“What’s the matter?” Laura 
asked. 

Douglas half rose from his 
chair. His face had gone sud- 
denly white. He stared in hor- 
ror, gripping the arms of his 
chair, his mouth opening and 
closing. 

At the window was a great 
eye. An immense eye that 
gazed into the room intently, 
studying him. The eye filled 
the whole window. 

“Good God!” Douglas cried. 

The eye withdrew. Outside 
there was only the evening 
gloom, the dark hills and 
trees, the street. Douglas sank 
down slowly in his chair. 

“What was it?” Laura de- 
manded sharply. “What did 
you see? Was somebody out 
there?” 

D OUGLAS clasped and un- 
clasped his hands. His 
lips twitched violently. “I’m 
telling you the truth, Bill. I 
saw it myself. It was real. I 
wouldn’t say so, otherwise. 
You know that. Don’t you be- 
lieve me?” 

“Did anybody else see it?” 
Professor William Henderson 
asked, chewing his pencil 
thoughtfully. He had cleared 
a place on the dinner table, 
pushed back his plate and sil- 
ver and laid out his notebook. 
“Did Laura see it?” 

“No. Laura had her back 
turned.” 

“What time was it?” 

“Half an hour ago. I had 
just got home. About six- 
thirty. I had my shoes off, tak- 
ing it easy.” Douglas wiped 
his forehead with a shaking 
hand. 

“You say it was unattach- 
ed? There was nothing else? 
Just the — eye?” 

“Just the eye. One huge eye 
looking in at me. Taking in 
everything. As if — ” 

“As if what?” 

“As if it was looking down 
a microscope.” 

Silence. 

From across the table, Hen- 
derson’s red-haired wife spoke 
up. “You always were a strict 
empiricist, Doug. You never 
went in for any nonsense be- 
fore. But this . It’s too bad 
nobody else saw it.” 

“Of course nobody else saw 
it!” 

“What do you mean?” 

“The damn thing was look- 
ing at me. It was me it was 
studying.” Douglas’ voice rose 
hysterically. “How do you 
think I feel — scrutinized by an 
eye as big as a piano ! My God, 
if I weren’t so well integrated, 
I’d be out of my mind !” 

Henderson and his wife ex- 
changed glances. Bill, dark- 
haired and handsome, ten 
years Douglas’ junior. Viva- 
cious Jean Henderson, lectur- 
er in child psychology, lithe 
and full-bosomed in her nylon 
blouse and slacks. 

“What do you make of 
this?” Bill asked her. “This is 
more along your line.” 

“It’s in your line,” Douglas 
snapped. “Don’t try to pass 
this off as a morbid projection. 
I came to you because you’re 
head of the Biology Depart- 
ment.” 

“You think it’s an animal? 
A giant sloth or something?” 
“It must be an animal.” 
“Maybe it’s a joke,” Jean 
suggested. “Or an advertising 
sign. An oculist’s display. 
Somebody may have been 
carrying it past the window.” 
Douglas took a firm grip on 
himself. “The eye was alive. 
It looked at me. It considered 
me. Then it withdrew. As if 
it had moved away from the 
lens.” He shuddered. “I tell 
you it was studying me!” 
“You only?” 

“Me. Nobody else.” 

“You seem curiously con- 
vinced it was looking down 
from above,” Jean said. 

“Yes, down. Down at me. 
That’s right.” An odd expres- 
sion flickered across Douglas’ 
face. “You have it, Jean. As if 
it came from up there.” He 
jerked his hand upward. 

“Maybe it was God,” Bill 
said thoughtfully. 

Douglas said nothing. His 
face turned ash white and his 
teeth chattered. 

“lYTONSENSE,” Jean said. 

-L ^ “God is a psychological 
transcendent symbol express- 
ing unconscious forces.” 

“Did it look at you accus- 
ingly?” asked Bill. “As if 
you’d done something wrong?” 
“No. With interest. With 
considerable interest.” Doug- 
las raised himself. “I have to 
get back. Laura thinks I’m 
having some kind of fit. I 
haven’t told her, of course. 
She’s not scientifically disci- 
plined. She wouldn’t be able to 
handle such a concept.” 

“It’s a little tough even for 
us,” Bill said. 

Douglas moved nervously 
toward the door. “You can’t 
think of any explanation? 
Something thought extinct 
that might still be roaming 
around these mountains?” 
“None that we know of. If 
I should hear of any — ” 

“You said it looked down,” 
Jean said. “Not bending down 
to peer in at you. Then it 
couldn’t have been an animal 
or terrestrial being.” She was 
deep in thought. “Maybe we’re 
being observed.” 

“Not you,” Douglas said 
miserably. “Just me.” 

“By another race,” Bill put 
in. “You think — ” 

“Maybe it’s an eye from 
Mars.” 

Douglas opened the front 
door carefully and peered out. 
The night was black. A faint 
wind moved through the trees 
and along the highway. His 
car was dimly visible, a black 
square against the hills. “If 
you think of anything, call 
me.” 

“Take a couple of pheno- 
barbitals before you hit the 
sack,” Jean suggested. “Calm 
your nerves.” 

Douglas was out on the 
porch. “Good idea. Thanks.” 
He shook his head. “Maybe 
I’m out of my mind. Good 
Lord. Well, I'll see you later.” 

He walked down the steps, 
gripping the rail tightly. 
“Good night!” Bill called. The 
door closed and the porch light 
clicked off. 

Douglas went cautiously to- 
ward his car. He reached out 
into the darkness, feeling for 
the door handle. One step. 
Two steps. It was silly. A 
grown man — practically mid- 
dle-aged — in the twentieth 
century. Three steps. 

He found the door and 
opened it, sliding quickly in- 
side and locking it after him. 
He breathed a silent prayer of 
thanks as he snapped on the 
motor and the headlights. 
Silly as hell. A giant eye. A 
stunt of some sort. 

He turned the thought over 
in his mind. Students? Joke- 
sters? Communists? A plot to 
drive him out of his mind? 

He was important. Probably 
the most important nuclear 
physicist in the country. And 
this new project . 

He drove the car slowly for- 
ward, onto the silent highway. 
He watched each bush and 
tree as the car gained speed. 

A Communist plot. Some of 
the students were in a left- 
wing club. Some sort of Marx- 
ist study group. Maybe they 
had rigged up — 

In the glare of the head- 
lights something glittered. 
Something at the edge of the 
highway. 

Douglas gazed at it, trans- 
fixed. Something square, a 
long block in the weeds at the 
side of the highway, where 
the great dark trees began. It 
glittered and shimmered. He 
slowed down, almost to a stop. 

A bar of gold, lying at the 
edge of the road. 

I T WAS incredible. Slowly, 
Professor Douglas rolled 
down the window and peered 
out. Was it really gold? He 
laughed nervously. Probably 
not. He had often seen gold, 
of course. This looked like 
gold. But maybe it was lead, 
an ingot of lead with a gilt 
coating. 

But — why? 

A joke. A prank. College 
kids. They must have seen his 
car go past toward the Hen- 
dersons’ and knew he’d soon be 
driving back. 

Or — or it really was gold. 
Maybe an armored car had 
gone past. Turned the corner 
too swiftly. The ingot had slid 
out and fallen into the weeds. 
In that case there was a little 
fortune lying there, in the 
darkness at the edge of the 
highway. 

But it was illegal to possess 
gold. He’d have to return it to 
the Government. But couldn’t 
he saw off just a little piece? 
And if he did return it there 
was no doubt a reward of 
some kind. Probably several 
thousand dollars. 

A mad scheme flashed brief- 
ly through his mind. Get the 
ingot, crate it up, fly it to Mex- 
ico, out of the country. Eric 
Barnes owned a Piper Cub. 
He could easily get it into 
Mexico. Sell it. Retire. Live in 
comfort the rest of his life. 

Professor Douglas snorted 
angrily. It was his duty to re- 
turn it. Call the Denver Mint, 
tell them about it. Or the po- 
lice department. He reversed 
his car and backed up until he 
was even with the metal bar. 
He turned off the motor and 
slid out onto the dark high- 
way. He had a job to do. As 
a loyal citizen — and, God 
knew, fifty tests had shown he 
was loyal — there was a job for 
him here. He leaned into the 
car and fumbled in the dash- 
board for the flashlight. If 
somebody had lost a bar of 
gold, it was up to him . 

A bar of gold. Impossible. 
A slow, cold chill settled over 
him, numbing his heart. A 
tiny voice in the back of his 
mind spoke clearly and ration- 
ally to him: Who would walk 
off and leave an ingot of gold? 
Something was going on. 

F EAR gripped him. He stood 
frozen, trembling with ter- 
ror. The dark, deserted high- 
way. The silent mountains. He 
was alone. A perfect spot. If 
they wanted to get him — 
They? 

Who? 

He looked quickly around. 
Hiding in the trees, most like- 
ly. Waiting for him. Waiting 
for him to cross the highway, 
leave the road and enter the 
woods. Bend down and try to 
pick up the ingot. One quick 
blow as he bent over; that 
would be it. 

Douglas scrambled back in- 
to his car and snapped on the 
motor. He raced the motor and 
released the brake. The car 
jerked forward and gained 
speed. His hands shaking, 
Douglas bore down desperate- 
ly on the wheel. He had to get 
out. Get away before — who- 
ever they were got him. 

As he shifted into high he 
took one last look back, peer- 
ing around through the open 
window. The ingot was still 
there, still glowing among the 
dark weeds at the edge of the 
highway. But there was a 
strange vagueness about it, an 
uncertain waver in the nearby 
atmosphere. 

Abruptly the ingot faded 
and disappeared. Its glow 
receded into darkness. 

Douglas glanced up, and 
gasped in horror. 

In the sky above him, some- 
thing blotted out the stars. A 
great shape, so huge it stag- 
gered him. The shape moved, 
a disembodied circle of living 
presence, directly over his 
head. 

A face. A gigantic, cosmic 
face peering down. Like some 
great moon, blotting out every- 
thing else. The face hung for 
an instant, intent on him — on 
the spot he had just vacated. 
Then the face, like the ingot, 
faded and sank into darkness. 

The stars returned. He was 
alone. 

Douglas sank back against 
the seat. The car veered crazi- 
ly and roared down the high- 
way. His hands slid from the 
wheel and dropped at his 
sides. He caught the wheel 
again, just in time. 

There was no doubt about it. 
Somebody was after him. Try- 
ing to get him. But no Com- 
munists or student practical 
jokers. Or any beast, lingering 
from the dim past. 

Whatever it was, whoever 
they were, had nothing to do 
with Earth. It — they — were 
from some other world. They 
were out to get him. 

Him . 

But — why? 

P ETE BERG listened close- 
ly. “Go on,” he said when 
Douglas halted. 

“That's all.” Douglas turned 
to Bill Henderson. “Don't try 
to tell me I’m out of my mind. 
I really saw it. It was looking 
down at me. The whole face 
this time, not just the eye.” 
“You think this was the 
face that the eye belonged 
to?” Jean Henderson asked. 

“I know it. The face had the 
same expression as the eye. 
Studying me.” 

“We’ve got to call the po- 
lice,” Laura Douglas said in a 
thin, clipped voice. “This can’t 
go on. If somebody’s out to get 
him — ” 

“The police won’t do any 
good.” Bill Henderson paced 
back and forth. It was late, 
after midnight. All the lights 
in the Douglas house were on. 
In one corner old Milton 
Erick, head of the Math De- 
partment, sat curled up, 
taking everything in, his 
wrinkled face expressionless. 

“We can assume,” Profes- 
sor Erick said calmly, remov- 
ing his pipe from between his 
yellow teeth, “they’re a non- 
terrestrial race. Their size 
and their position indicate 
they’re not Earthbound in any 
sense.” 

“But they can’t just stand 
in the sky!” Jean exploded. 
“There’s nothing up there !” 
“There may be other config- 
urations of matter not nor- 
mally connected or related to 
our own. An endless or multi- 
ple coexistence of universe 
systems, lying along a plane 
of coordinates totally unex- 
plainable in present terms. 
Due to some singular juxtapo- 
sition of tangents, we are, at 
this moment, in contact with 
one of these other configura- 
tions.” 

“He means,” Bill Henderson 
explained, “that these people 
after Doug don’t belong to our 
universe. They come from a 
different dimension entirely.” 
“The face wavered,” Doug- 
las murmured. “The gold and 
the face both wavered and 
faded out.” 

“Withdrew,” Erick stated. 
“Returned to their own uni- 
verse. They have entry into 
ours at will, it would seem, a 
hole, so to speak, that they 
can enter through and return 
again.” 

“It’s a pity,” Jean said, 
“they’re so damn big. If they 
were smaller — ” 

“Size is in their favor,” 
Erick admitted. “An unfortu- 
nate circumstance.” 

“All this academic wran- 
gling!” Laura cried wildly. 
“We sit here working out 
theories and meanwhile they 
are after him!” 

“This might explain gods,” 
Bill said suddenly. 

“Gods?” 

B ILL nodded. “Don’t you 
see? In the past these 
beings looked across the nexus 
at us, into our universe. May- 
be even stepped down. Primi- 
tive people saw them and 
weren’t able to explain them. 
They built religions around 
them. Worshiped them.” 
“Mount Olympus,” Jean 
said. “Of course. And Moses 
met God at the top of Mount 
Sinai. We’re high up in the 
Rockies. Maybe contact only 
comes at high places. In the 
mountains, like this.” 

“And the Tibetan monks 
are situated in the highest 
land mass in the world,” Bill 
added. “That whole area. The 
highest and the oldest part of 
the world. All the great reli- 
gions have been revealed in 
the mountains. Brought down 
by people who saw God and 
carried the word back.” 

“What I can’t understand,” 
Laura said, “is why they want 
him.” She spread her hands 
helplessly. “Why not some- 
body else? Why do they have 
to single him out?” 

Bill’s face was hard. “I 
think that’s pretty clear.” 
“Explain,” Erick rumbled. 
“What is Doug? About the 
best nuclear physicist in the 
world. Working on top-secret 
projects in nuclear fission. Ad- 
vanced research. The Govern- 
ment is underwriting every- 
thing Bryant College is doing 
— because Douglas is here.” 
“So?” 

“They want him because of 
his ability. Because he knows 
things. Because of their size- 
relationship to this universe, 
they can subject our lives to 
as careful a scrutiny as we 
maintain in the biology labs of 
— 'well, of a culture of Sarcina 
Pulmonum. But that doesn’t 
mean they’re culturally ad- 
vanced over us.” 

“Of course!” Pete Berg ex- 
claimed. “They want Doug for 
his knowledge. They want to 
pirate him off and make use 
of his mind for their own cul- 
ture.” 

“Parasites!” Jean gasped. 
“They must have always de- 
pended on us. Don’t you see? 
Men in the past who have dis- 
appeared, spirited off by these 
creatures.” She shivered. 
“They probably regard us as 
some sort of testing ground, 
where techniques and knowl- 
edge are painfully developed — 
for their benefit.” 

Douglas started to answer, 
but the words never escaped 
his mouth. He sat rigid in his 
chair, his head turned to one 
side. 

Outside in the darkness be- 
yond the house, someone was 
calling his name. 

H E GOT up and moved to- 
ward the door. They were 
all staring at him in amaze- 
ment. 

“What is it?” Bill demand- 
ed. “What’s the matter, 
Doug?” 

Laura caught his arm. 
“What’s wrong? Are you sick? 
Say something! Doug!" 

Professor Douglas jerked 
free and pulled open the front 
door. He stepped out onto the 
porch. There was a faint 
moon. A soft light hovered 
over everything. 

“Professor Douglas!” The 
voice again, sweet and fresh 
— a girl’s voice. 

Outlined by the moonlight, 
at the foot of the porch steps, 
stood a girl. Blonde-haired, 
perhaps twenty years old. In a 
checkered skirt, pale Angora 
sweater, a silk kerchief 
around her neck. She was 
waving at him anxiously, her 
small face pleading. 

“Professor, do you have a 
minute? Something terrible 
has gone wrong with ...” Her 
voice trailed off as she moved 
nervously away from the 
house, into the darkness. 

“What’s the matter?” he 
shouted. 

He could hear her voice 
faintly. She was moving off. 

Douglas was torn with in- 
decision. He hesitated, then 
hurried impatiently down the 
stairs after her. The girl re- 
treated from him, wringing 
her hands together, her full 
lips twisting wildly with de- 
spair. Under her sweater, her 
breasts rose and fell in an 
agony of terror, each quiver 
sharply etched by the moon- 
light. 

“What is it?” Douglas cried. 
“What’s wrong?” He hurried 
angrily after her. “For God’s 
sake, stand still!” 

The girl was still moving 
away, drawing him farther 
and farther away from the 
house, toward the great green 
expanse of lawn, the begin- 
ning of the campus. Douglas 
was overcome with annoy- 
ance. Damn the girl ! Why 
couldn’t she wait for him? 

“Hold on a minute!” he 

said, hurrying after her. He 
started out onto the dark 
lawn, puffing with exertion. 
“Who are you? What the hell 
do you — ” 

There was a flash. A bolt of 
blinding light crashed past 
him and seared a smoking pit 
in the lawn a few feet away. 

D ouglas halted, dum- 

founded. A second bolt 
came, this one just ahead of 
him. The wave of heat threw 
him back. He stumbled and 
half fell. The girl had abrupt- 
ly stopped. She stood silent 
and unmoving, her face ex- 
pressionless. There was a pe- 
culiar waxy quality to her. 
She had become, all at once, 
utterly inanimate. 

But he had no time to think 
about that. Douglas turned 
and lumbered back toward the 
house. A third bolt came, 
striking just ahead of him. 
He veered to the right and 
threw himself into the shrubs 
growing near the wall. Rolling 
and gasping, he pressed 
against the concrete side of 
the house, squeezing next to it 
as hard as he could. 

There was a sudden shim- 
mer in the star-studded sky 
above him. A faint motion. 
Then nothing. He was alone. 
The bolts ceased. And — 

The girl was gone, also. 

A decoy. A clever imitation 
to lure him away from the 
house, so he’d move out into 
the open where they could 
take a shot at him. 

He got shakily to his feet 
and edged around the side of 
the house. Bill Henderson and 
Laura and Berg were on the 
porch, talking nervously and 
looking around for him. There 
was his car, parked in the 
driveway. Maybe, if he could 
reach it— 

He peered up at the sky. 
Only stars. No hint of them. 
If he could get in his car and 
drive off, down the highway, 
away from the mountains, to- 
ward Denver, where it was 
lower, maybe he’d be safe. 

He took a deep, shuddering 
breath. Only ten yards to the 
car. Thirty feet. If he could 
once get in it — 

He ran. Fast. Down the 
path and along the driveway. 
He grabbed open the car door 
and leaped inside. With one 
quick motion he threw the 
switch and released the brake. 

The car glided forward. The 
motor came on with a sputter. 
Douglas bore down desperate- 
ly on the gas. The car leaped 
forward. On the porch, Laura 
shrieked and started down the 
stairs. Her cry and Bill’s star- 
tled shout were lost in the roar 
of the engine. 

A moment later he was on 
the highway, racing away 
from town, down the long, 
curving road toward Denver. 

H E COULD call Laura from 
Denver. She could join 
him. They could take the train 
east. The hell with Bryant 
College. His life was at stake. 

He drove for hours without 
stopping, through the night. 
The sun came up and rose 
slowly in the sky. More cars 
were on the road now. He 
passed a couple of diesel 
trucks rumbling slowly and 
cumbersomely along. 

He was beginning to feel a 
little better. The mountains 
were behind. More distance 
between him and them . 

His spirits rose as the day 
warmed. There were hundreds 
of universities and labora- 
tories scattered around the 
country. He could easily con- 
tinue with his work someplace 
else. They’d never get him, 
once he was out of the moun- 
tains. 

He slowed his car down. The 
gas gauge was near empty. 

To the right of the road was 
a filling station and a small 
roadside cafe. The sight of the 
cafe reminded him he hadn’t 
eaten breakfast. His stomach 
was beginning to protest. 
There were a couple of cars 
pulled up in front of the cafe. 
A few people were sitting in- 
side at the counter. 

He turned off the highway 
and coasted into the gas sta- 
tion. 

“Fill her up!” he called 
to the attendant. He got out 
on the hot gravel, leaving the 
car in gear. His mouth wa- 
tered. A plateful of hotcakes, 
side order of ham, steaming 
black coffee . “Can I leave 
her here?” 

“The car?” The white-clad 
attendant unscrewed the cap 
and began filling the tank. 
“What do you mean?” 

“Fill her up and park her 
for me. I’ll be out in a few 
minutes. I want to catch some 
breakfast.” 

“Breakfast?” 

Douglas was annoyed. What 
was the matter with the man ? 
He indicated the cafe. A truck 
driver had pushed the screen 
door open and was standing 
on the step, picking his teeth 
thoughtfully. Inside, the wait- 
ress hustled back and forth. 
He could already smell the cof- 
fee, the bacon frying on the 
griddle. A faint tinny sound 
of a juke box drifted out. A 
warm, friendly sound. “The 
cafe.” 

The attendant stopped 
pumping gas. He put down the 
hose slowly and turned toward 
Douglas, a strange expression 
on his face. “What cafe?” he 
said. 

T HE cafe wavered and ab- 
ruptly winked out. Doug- 
las fought down a scream of 
terror. Where the cafe had 
been there was only an open 
field. 

Greenish brown grass. A 
few rusty tin cans. Bottles. 
Debris. A leaning fence. Off in 
the distance, the outline of the 
mountains. 

Douglas tried to get hold of 
himself. “I’m a little tired,” 
he muttered. He climbed un- 
steadily back into the car. 
“How much?” 

“I just hardly began to fill 
the—” 

“Here.” Douglas pushed a 
bill at him. “Get out of the 
way.” He turned on the motor 
and raced out onto the high- 
way, leaving the astonished 
attendant staring after him. 

That had been close. Damn 
close. A trap. And he had al- 
most stepped inside. 

But the thing that really 
terrified him wasn’t the close- 
ness. He was out of the moun- 
tains and they had still been 
ahead of him. 

It hadn’t done any good. He 
wasn’t any safer than last 
night. They were everywhere.. 

The car sped along the high- 
way. He was getting near 
Denver — but so what? It 
wouldn’t make any difference. 
He could dig a hole in Death 
Valley and still not be safe. 
They were after him and they 
weren’t going to give up. That 
much was clear. 

He racked his mind desper- 
ately. He had to think of some- 
thing, some way to get loose. 

A parasitic culture. A race 
that preyed on humans, util- 
ized human knowledge and 
discoveries. Wasn’t that what 
Bill had said? They were after 
his know-how, his unique abil- 
ity and knowledge of nuclear 
physics. He had been singled 
out, separated from the pack 
because of his superior ability 
and training. They would keep 
after him until they got him. 
And then — what? 

Horror gripped him. The 
gold ingot. The decoy. The girl 
had looked perfectly real. The 
cafe full of people. Even the 
smells of food. Bacon frying. 
Steaming coffee. 

God, if only he were just an 
ordinary person, without skill, 
without special ability. If 
only — 

A sudden flapping sound. 
The car lurched. Douglas 
cursed wildly. A flat. Of all 
times . 

Of all times. 

D OUGLAS brought the car 
to a halt at the side of the 
road. He switched off the mo- 
tor and put on the brake. For 
a while he sat in silence. Fi- 
nally he fumbled in his coat 
and got out a mashed pack- 
age of cigarettes. He lit up 
slowly and then rolled the 
window down to let in some 
air. 

He was trapped, of course. 
There was nothing he could 
do. The flat had obviously been 
arranged. Something on the 
road, sprinkled down from 
above. Tacks, probably. 

The highway was deserted. 
No cars in sight. He was ut- 
terly alone, between towns. 
Denver was thirty miles 
ahead. No chance of getting 
there. Nothing around him 
but terribly level fields, deso- 
lated plains. 

Nothing but level ground — 
and the blue sky above. 

Douglas peered up. He 
couldn’t see them, but they 
were there, waiting for him to 
get out of his car. His knowl- 
edge, his ability, would be 
utilized by an alien culture. He 
would become an instrument 
in their hands. All his learn- 
ing would be theirs. He would 
be a slave and nothing more. 

Yet, in a way, it was a com- 
pliment. From a whole society, 
he alone had been selected. 
His skill and knowledge, over 
everything else. A faint glow 
rose in his cheeks. Probably 
they had been studying him 
for some time. The great eye 
had no doubt often peered 
down through its telescope, or 
microscope, or whatever it 
was, peered down and seen 
him. Seen his ability and real- 
ized what that would be worth 
in its own culture. 

Douglas opened the car 
door. He stepped out onto the 
hot pavement. He dropped his 
cigarette and calmly stubbed 
it out. He took a deep breath, 
stretching and yawning. He 
could see the tacks now, bright 
bits of light on the surface of 
the pavement. Both front tires 
were flat. 

Something shimmered 
above him. Douglas waited 
quietly. Now that it had final- 
ly come, he was no longer 
afraid. He watched with a 
kind of detached curiosity. 
The something grew. It fan- 
ned out over him, swelling and 
expanding. For a moment it 
hesitated. Then it descended. 

Douglas stood still as the 
enormous cosmic net closed 
over him. The strands pressed 
against him as the net rose. 
He was going up, heading to- 
ward the sky. But he was re- 
laxed, at peace, no longer 
afraid. 

Why be afraid? He would 
be doing much the same work 
as always. He would miss 
Laura and the college, of 
course, the intellectual com- 
panionship of the faculty, the 
bright faces of the students. 
But no doubt he would find 
companionship up above. Per- 
sons to work with. Trained 
minds with which he could 
communicate. 

T HE net was lifting him 
faster and faster. The 
ground fell rapidly away. The 
Earth dwindled from a flat 
surface to a globe. Douglas 
watched with professional in- 
terest. Above him, beyond the 
intricate strands of the net, he 
could see the outline of the 
other universe, the new world 
toward which he was heading. 

Shapes. Two enormous 
shapes squatting down. Two 
incredibly huge figures bend- 



ing over. One was drawing in 
the net. The other watched, 
holding something in its hand. 
A landscape. Dim forms too 
vast for Douglas to compre- 
hend. 

At last , a thought came. 
What a struggle . 

It tvas worth it, thought the 
other creature. 

Their thoughts roared 
through him. Powerful 
thoughts, from immense 
minds. 

I teas right . The biggest 
yet . What a catch! 

Must tveigh all of twenty- 
four vagets! 

At least! 

Suddenly Douglas' compo- 
sure left him. A chill of hor- 
ror flashed through his mind. 
What were they talking 
about? What did they mean? 

But then he was being 
dumped from the net. He was 
falling. Something was com- 
ing up at him. A flat, shiny 
surface. What was it? 

Oddly, it looked almost like 
a frying pan.
