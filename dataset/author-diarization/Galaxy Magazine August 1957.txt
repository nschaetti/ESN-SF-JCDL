Be careful before you answer. 
GENIAC the first electrical brain 
construction kit is equipped to play 
tic-tac-toe, cipher and encipher codes, 
convert from binary to decimal, rea- 
son in syllogisms, as well as add, sub- 
tract, multiply and divide. Specific 
problems in a variety of fields — ac- 
tuarial, policy claim settlement, phys- 
ics, etc., can be set up and solved 
with the components. Connections are 
solderless and are completely ex- 
plained with templates in the manual. 
This covers 33 circuits and shows 
how new ones can be designed. 

You will find building and using 
GENIACS a wonderful experience; 
one kit user wrote us: “this kit has 
opened up a new world of thinking 
to me.” You actually see how com- 
puting, problem solving, and game 
play (Tic-tac-toe, nim, etc.) can be 
analyzed with Boolean Algebra and 
the algebraic solutions transformed 
directly into circuit diagrams. You 
create from over 400 specially de- 
signed and manufactured compo- 
nents a machine that solves prob- 
lems faster than you can express 
them. 

Schools and colleges, teachers of 



science or math, engineering, phi- 
losophy or psychology will find these 
excellent demonstrators of circuitry, 
solutions in symbolic logic, theory of 
numbers, cybernetics, and automa- 
tion. 

Note: Teachers take advantage of 
our 10% discount to educational in- 
situations and for group purchases.

Time Waits 
for Winthrop 



By WILLIAM TENN 



Winthrop was literally the most stubborn and 
selfish man in five hundred years— how could 
they convince him not to strand them in this 
society of Shriek Fields and Panic Stadiums? 




Illustrated by FINLAY 



T HAT was the trouble right 
there —Winthrop was stub- 
born. 

Mrs. Brucks stared wildly at 



her three fellow-visitors from the 
twentieth century. “But he’s got 
to think of us, too! He can’t leave 
us stuck in this crazy world!” 



6 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Dave Pollock shrugged the 
shoulders of the conservative gray 
suit that clashed so mightily with 
the decor of the twenty-fifth-cen- 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



tury room. He was a thin, nervous 
young man whose hands had a 
tendency to perspire. 

“He says we should be grateful. 

7 



But whether we are or aren’t 
grateful isn’t important to him. 
He’s staying.” 

“That means we have to stay,” 
Mrs. Brucks said. “Doesn’t he un- 
derstand that?” 

Pollock spread his moist palms 
helplessly. “What difference does 
it make? He likes the twenty-fifth 
century. I argued with him for 
two hours and I’ve never seen 
anyone so stubborn. I can’t budge 
him.” 

“Why don’t you talk to him, 
Mrs. Brucks?” Mary Ann Carth- 
ington suggested. “He’s been nice 
to you. Maybe you could make 
him act sensible.” 

“Hm.” Mrs. Brucks patted her 
hairdo which, after two weeks in 
the future, was beginning to get 
straggly. “You think so? Mr. 
Mead, you think it’s a good idea?” 
The fourth person in the oval 
room, a stoutish middle-aged man, 
considered the matter for a mo- 
ment. “Can’t do any harm. Might 
work. And we’ve got to do some- 
thing.” 

“All right. So I’ll try.” 

TVTRS. BRUCKS sniffled deep 
within her grandmotherly 
soul. To the others, Winthrop and 
she were the “old folks”— both 
over fifty. Therefore they should 
be able to communicate more 
easily. The fact that Winthrop 
was ten years her senior meant 
little to Mr. Mead’s forty-six 

8 



years, less to Dave Pollock’s thir- 
ty-four and in all probability was 
completely meaningless to Mary 
Ann Carthington’s twenty. One of 
the “old folks” should be able to 
talk sense to the other, they were 
thinking. 

What could they see, from the 
bubbling distance of youth, of the 
chasms that separated Winthrop 
from Mrs. Brucks even more fi- 
nally than the others? It was un- 
important to them that he was a 
tight and unemotional old bach- 
elor, while she was the warm and 
gossipy mother of six children, the 
grandmother of two, with her sil- 
ver wedding anniversary proudly 
behind her. She and Winthrop 
had barely exchanged a dozen 
sentences with each other since 
they’d arrived in the future; they 
had disliked each other from the 
moment they had met in Wash- 
ington at the time-travel finals. 

But — Winthrop was stubborn. 
That fact remained. Mr. Mead 
had roared his best executive-type 
roars at him. Mary Ann Carth- 
ington had tried to jog his senility 
with her lush, young figure and 
most fluttery voice. Even Dave 
Pollock, an educated man, a high 
school science teacher, had talked 
his heart out to him and been un- 
able to make him budge. 

Someone had to change Win- 
throp’s mind or they’d all be 
stuck in the future, here in this 
horrible twenty-fifth century. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Even if she hated it more than 
anything she’d had to face in a 
lifetime of troubles, it was up to 
Mrs. Brucks. 

She rose and shook out the 
wrinkles in the expensive black 
dress her proud husband had pur- 
chased in Lord & Taylor’s the 
day before the group had left. 

Try to tell Sam that it was 
pure luck that she had been 
chosen, just a matter of fitting 
the physical specifications in the 
message from the future! Sam 
wouldn’t listen: he’d probably 

boasted all over the shop, to all 
the other cutters with whom he 
worked, about his Wife — one of 
five people selected in the whole 
United States to make a trip five 
hundred years into the future. 
Would Sam still be boasting when 
the six o’clock deadline passed 
that night and she didn’t return? 

This time the sniffle worked its 
way through the cushions of her 
bosom and reached her nose. 

Mary Ann Carthington crooned 
sympathetically, “Shall I call for 
the jumper, Mrs. Brucks?” 

“I’m crazy?” Mrs. Brucks shot 
back angrily. “A little walk down 
the hall, I need that headache- 
maker? A little walk I can walk.” 

CHE started for the door rap- 
^ idly, before the girl could 
summon the upsetting device 
which exploded you from one 
place to another and left you with

your head swimming and your 
stomach splashing. 

But she paused and took a last 
wistful look at the room before 
leaving it. While it was by no 
means a cozy five-room apart- 
ment in the Bronx, she’d spent 
almost every minute of her two 
weeks in the future here, and for 
all of its peculiar furniture and 
oddly colored walls, she hated to 
leave it. At least here nothing rip- 
pled along the floor, nothing 
reached out from the walls: here 
was as much sanity as you could 
find in the twenty-fifth century. 

Then she swallowed hard and 
closed the door behind her. She 
walked hurriedly along the corri- 
dor, being careful to stay in the 
exact middle, the greatest dis- 
tance possible from the bumpy 
writhing walls on either side. 

At a point in the corridor 
where one purple wall flowed 
restlessly around a stable yellow 
square, she stopped. She put her 
mouth, fixed in distaste, to the 
square. “Mr. Winthrop?” 

“Well, well, if it isn’t Mrs. 
Brucks!” the square boomed back 
at her. “Long time no see. Come 
right in, Mrs. Brucks.” 

The patch of yellow showed a 
tiny hole in the center which di- 
lated rapidly into a doorway. She 
stepped through gingerly, as if 
there might be a drop of several 
stories on the other side. 

The room was shaped like a 



9 



long, narrow isosceles triangle. 
There was no furniture in it, and 
no other exits, except for what an 
occasional yellow square sug- 
gested. Streaks of color chased 
themselves fluently along the 
walls and ceilings and floors, shift- 
ing up and down the spectrum, 
from pinkish gray to a thick, dark 
ultramarine. And odors came and 
went with the colors, some of 
them unpleasant, some intriguing, 
but all of them touched with the 
unfamiliar and alien. 

From somewhere behind the 
walls and above the ceiling there 
was music, its tones softly echo- 
ing, gently reinforcing the colors 
and the odors. The music, too, 
was strange to twentieth-century 
ears: strings of dissonances would 
be followed by long or short si- 
lences, in the midst of which an 
almost inaudible melody might 
be heard like a harmonic island 
in an ocean of sonic strangeness. 

At the sharp apex of the tri- 
angle, an aged little man lay on a 
raised portion of the floor. Peri- 
odically, this would raise or lower 
part of itself, very much like a 
cow trying to find a comfortable 
position on the grass. 

The single garment that Win- 
throp wore similarly kept adjust- 
ing itself upon him. At one mo- 
ment, it would be a striped red 
and white tunic, covering every- 
thing from his shoulders to his 
thighs; then it would slowly elon- 

10 



gate into a green gown that 
trickled over his outstretched 
toes; and abruptly, it would con- 
tract into a pair of light brown 
shorts decorated with a complete 
pattern of brilliant blue seashells. 

TV/TRS. BRUCKS observed all 
this with disapproval. A 
man was meant, she felt, to be 
dressed approximately the same 
way from one minute to the next. 

The shorts she didn’t mind, 
though her modest soul consid- 
ered them a bit too skimpy for 
receiving lady callers. The green 
gown — well, if he wanted to wear 
what was essentially a dress, it 
was his business. Even the red 
and white tunic which reminded 
her nostalgically of her grand- 
daughter Debbie’s sunsuit was 
something she was willing to be 
generous about. But at least stick 
to one of them! 

Winthrop put the enormous egg 
he was holding on the floor. 
“Have a seat, Mrs. Brucks. Take 
the load off your feet,” he said 
jovially. 

Shuddering at the hillock of 
floor which came into being at her 
host’s gesture, Mrs. Brucks finally 
bent her knees and uneasily sat. 
“How — how are you, Mr. Win- 
throp?” 

“Couldn’t be better, Mrs. 
Brucks. Say, have you seen my 
new teeth? Just got them this 
morning. Look.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He opened his jaws and pulled 
his lips back with his fingers. 

Mrs. Brucks, really interested, 
inspected the mouthful of white, 
shining teeth. “A good job,” she 
pronounced at last. “The dentists 
here made them for you so fast?” 
“Dentists!” He spread his bony 
arms in a vast and merry gesture. 
“They don’t have dentists in 2458 
a.d. They grew these teeth for me, 
Mrs. Brucks.” 

“Grew? How grew?” 

“How should I know how they 
did it? They’re smart, that’s all. 
A lot smarter than us, every way. 
I just heard about the regenera- 
tion clinic. It’s a place where you 
lose an arm, you go down there, 
they grow it right back on the 
stump. Free, like everything else. 
I went down there, I said ‘I want 
new teeth” to the machine that 
they’ve got. The machine tells me 
to take a seat, it goes one, two, 
three and bingo, there I am, 
throwing my plates away. You 
want to try it?” 

She shifted uncomfortably on 
her hillock. “Maybe — but I better 
wait until it’s perfected.” 

Winthrop laughed again. 
“You’re like the others, scared of 
the twenty-fifth century. Anything 
new, anything different, you want 
to run for a hole like a rabbit. I’m 
the oldest, but that doesn’t make 
any difference — I’m the only one 
with guts.” 

Mrs. Brucks smiled tremulous- 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



ly at him. “But you’re also the 
only one without no one to go 
back to. I got a family, Mr. Mead 
has a family, Mr. Pollock’s just 
married, a newlywed, and Miss 
Carthington is engaged. We’d all 
like to go back, Mr. Winthrop.” 

“Mary Ann is engaged? I’d 
never have guessed it from the 
way she was playing up to that 
temporal supervisor fellow.” 

“Still and all, Mr. Winthrop, 
she’s engaged. To a bookkeeper in 
her office, a fine, hard-working 
boy. And she wants to go back to 
him.” 

1 1 THE old man pulled up his 
-®- back and the floor-couch 
hunched up between his shoulder- 
blades and scratched him gently. 
“Let her go back then. Who gives 
a damn?” 

Mrs. Brucks turned her hands 
palm up in front of her. “Remem- 
ber what they told us when we 
arrived? We all have to be sitting 
in our chairs in the Time Ma- 
chine Building at six o’clock on 
the dot. If we aren’t all there on 
time, they can’t make the transfer, 
they said. So if one of us, if you, 
for an instance, don’t show up — ” 

“Don’t tell me your troubles!” 
His face was flushed and his lips 
came back and exposed the 
brand-new teeth. There was a 
sharp acrid smell in the room and 
blotches of crimson on its walls 
as the place adjusted to its own- 

11 



er’s mood. The music changed to 
a vicious rumble. “Everybody 
wants Winthrop to do a favor for 
them. What did they ever do for 
Winthrop?” 

“I don’t understand you.” 

“You’re damn tooting you don’t 
understand me! When I was a kid, 
my old man used to come home 
drunk every night and beat the 
hell out of me. I was a small kid, 
so every other kid on the block 
took turns beating the hell out of 
me, too. When I grew up, I got a 
lousy job and a lousy life. Re- 
member the depression? Who do 
you think was on those bread- 
lines? Me, that’s who! And then, 
when the good times came back, 
I was too old for a decent job. 
N ight - watchman, berry - picker, 
dishwasher. Cheap flophouses, 
cheap furnished rooms. Every- 
body gets the gravy, Winthrop 
got the garbage.” 

He picked up the large egg- 
shaped object he had been exam- 
ining when she entered and stud- 
ied it moodily. “Yeah. And like 
you said, everybody has someone 
to go back to, everybody but me. 
You’re damn tooting I don’t have 
anyone to go back to. Damn toot- 
ing. I never had a friend, never 
had a wife, never even had a girl 
that stayed around longer than it 
took her to use up the loose 
change in my pocket. So why 
should I go back? I’m happy 
here. I get everything I want and 

12 



I don’t have to pay for it. You 
people want to go back because 
you feel different — uncomfort- 
able, out of place. I’m used to 
being out of place: I’m right at 
home and I’m having a good time. 
I’m staying.” 




ward anxiously, then jumped as 
the seat under her slunk forward. 
“Mr. Winthrop, everybody has 
troubles in their life. With my

I wouldn’t wish on my worst 
enemy. And with my Julius — But 
because I have troubles, you think 
I should take it out on other peo- 
ple? I should prevent them from 
going home when they’re sick and 
tired of jumper machines and 
food machines and — I don’t know 
— machine machines and — ” 
“Speaking of food machines,” 
Winthrop perked up, “have you 
seen my new food phonograph? 
Latest model. I said I wanted one, 
and first thing this morning, a 
brand-new one is delivered to my 
door. No fuss, no bother, no 
money. What a world!” 

“But it’s not your world, Mr. 
Winthrop. Even if everything is 
free, you’re not entitled. You got 
to belong to be entitled.” 

“There’s nothing in their laws 
about that,” he commented ab- 
sent-mindedly as he opened the 
huge egg and peered inside at the

collection of dials and switches 
and spigots. “See, Mrs. Brucks? 
Double volume controls, double 
intensity controls, triple vitamin 
controls. With this one, you can 
raise the fat content of a meal, 
say, while reducing its sweetness 
with that doohickey there — and 
if you press that switch, you can 
compress the whole meal so it’s 
no bigger than a mouthful and 
you’re still hungry enough to try 
a couple of other compositions. 
Want to try it? I got it set for 
the latest number by Unni Oehele, 
that new Aldebaranian composer 
— Memories of a Martian Souf- 
fle.” 

She shook her head emphati- 
cally. “No. By me, a meal is 
served in plates. I don’t want to 
try it. Thank you very much.” 

“Believe me, lady, you’re miss- 
ing something. The first course is 
a kind of light, fast movement, 
all herbs from Aldebaran IV 
mixed with a spicy vinegar from 
Aldebaran IX. The second course, 
Consomme Grand, is a lot slower 
and kind of majestic. Oehele 
bases it all on a broth made from 
the white chund, a kangaroo ani- 
mal they have on Aldebaran IV. 
See, he uses only native Aleba- 
ranian foods to suggest a Mar- 
tian dish. Get it? The same thing 
Kratzmeier did in A Long, Long 
Dessert on Deimos and Phobos, 
only it’s a lot better. More mod- 
ern-like, if you know what I mean. 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



Now in the third course, Oehele 
really takes off. He — ” 

“Please, Mr. Winthrop!” Mrs. 
Brucks begged. “Enough!” She 
glared at him. She’d had her fill of 
this sort of thing from her son 
Julius years ago, when he’d been 
running around with a crazy 
crowd from City College and been 
spouting hours of incomprehen- 
sible trash at her that he’d picked 
up from newspaper musical re- 
views and the printed notes in 
record albums. One thing she’d 
learned was how to recognize an 
art phony. 

V¥/"IN THROP shrugged. “Okay, 
” okay. But you’d think you’d 
at least want to try it. The others 
at least took a bite of classical 
Kratzmeier or Gura-Hok. They 
didn’t like it, they spat it out — 
fine. But you’ve been living on 
nothing but that damn twentieth- 
century grub since we arrived. 
After the first day, you haven’t 
set foot outside your room. And 
the way you asked the room to 
decorate itself — it’s so old-fash- 
ioned, it makes me sick! You’re 
living in the twenty-fifth century, 
lady! Wake up!” 

“Mr. Winthrop,” she said stern- 
ly. “yes or no? You’re going to be 
nice or not?” 

“You’re in your fifties,” he 
pointed out. “Fifties, Mrs. Brucks. 
In our time, you can expect to 
live what? Ten or fifteen more 

13 



years. Tops. Here, you might see 
another thirty, maybe forty. Me, 
I figure I’m good for at least 
twenty. With the medical ma- 
chines they got, they can do won- 
ders. And no wars to worry about, 
no epidemics, no depressions, 
nothing. Everything free, lots of 
exciting things to do, Mars, Venus, 
the stars. Why in hell are you so 
crazy to go back?” 

Mrs. Brucks’ already half-dis- 
solved self-control gave way com- 
pletely. “Because it’s my home! 
Because it’s what I understand! 
Because I want to be with my 
husband, my children, my grand- 
children! And because I don’t like 
it here, Mr. Winthrop!” 

“So go back!” Winthrop yelled. 
The room, which for the last few 
moments had settled into a pale 
golden yellow, turned rose color 
again. “There’s not one of you 
with the guts of a cockroach. 
Even that young fellow, what’s- 
his-name, Dave Pollock, I thought 
he had guts. He went out with me 
for the first week and he tried 
everything once. But he got 
scared, too, and went back to his 
little old comfy room. It’s too 
dec-a-dent, he says, too dec-a-dent. 
So take him with you and get the 
hell back, all of you!” 

“But we can’t, Mr. Winthrop. 
Remember they said the transfer 
has to be complete on both sides? 
One stays behind, all stay. We 
can’t go back without you.” 



Winthrop smiled and stroked 
the throbbing vein on his neck. 
“You’re damn tooting you can’t 
go back without me. And I’m 
staying. This is one time that old 
Winthorp calls the tune.” 

“Please, Mr. Winthrop, don’t be 
stubborn. Be nice. Don’t make us 
force you.” 

“You can’t force me,” he told 
her with a triumphant leer. “I 
know my rights. According to the 
law of twenty -fifth -century 
America, no human being can be 
forced to do anything. Fact. You 
try to gang up on me, all I do is 
set up a holler that I’m being 
forced and a flock of government 
machines show up and turn me 
loose. Put that in your old cala- 
bash and smoke it!” 

“Listen,” she said as she turned 
to leave. “At six o’clock, we’ll all 
be in the Time Machine Building. 
Maybe you’ll change your mind, 
Mr. Winthrop.” 

“That’s one thing you can be 
sure of — I won’t change my 
mind.” 

So Mrs. Brucks went back to 
her room and told the others that 
Winthrop was stubborn as ever.

especially but uneasily for him. 

“Ridiculous!” he exclaimed. 
“That a derelict, a vagrant, should 
be able to keep people from go- 
ing about their business ... do 
you know there’s going to be a 
nationwide sales conference of 
Sweetbottom retail outlets in a 
few days? I absolutely must re- 
turn tonight as scheduled, no ifs, 
no ands, no buts. There’s going to 
be one unholy mess, I can tell 
you, if the responsible parties in 
this period don’t see to that.” 

“I bet there will be,” Mary Ann 
Carthington said from behind 
round, respectful and well-mas- 
caraed eyes. “A big firm like that 
can really .give them what for, 
Mr. Mead.” 

Dave Pollock grimaced at her 
wearily. “A firm five hundred 
years out of existence? Who’re 
they going to complain to — the 
history books?” 

As the portly man stiffened 
angrily, Mrs. Brucks held up her 
hands and said, “Let’s talk, let’s 
think it out, only don’t fight. You 
think it’s the truth we can’t force 
him to go back?” 

Mr. Mead leaned back and 
stared out of a non-existent win- 
dow. “Could be. Then again, it 
might not. I’m willing to believe 
anything of 2458 by now, but this 
smacks of criminal irresponsibil- 
ity. That they should invite us to

we return safe and sound — be- 
sides, what about their people vis- 
iting in our time, the five with 
whom we transferred? If we’re 
stuck here, they’ll be stuck in 
1958 . Forever. Any government 
worthy of the name owls protec- 
tion to its citizens traveling 
abroad. Without it, it’s less than 
worthless: a tax-grubbing, boon- 
doggling, inept bureaucracy!” 
Mary Ann Carthington’s pert 
little face had been nodding in 
time to his fist beating on the red 
leather armchair. “That’s what I 
say. Only the government seems 
to be all machines. How can you 
argue with machines? The only 
government man we’ve seen since 
we arrived was that Mr. Storku 
who welcomed us to the United 
States of 2458. And he didn’t 
seem very interested in us. At 
least he didn’t show any interest.” 
“The Chief of Protocol for the 
State Department, you mean?” 
Dave Pollock asked. “The one 
who yawned when you told him 
how distinguished he looked?” 

T 1 ’’HE girl made a light slapping 
gesture at him. “Oh, you.” 
“Well, then, here’s what we 
have to do. One.” Mr. Mead rose 
and proceeded to open the fingers 
of his right hand a single finger 
at a time. “We have to go on the 
basis of the only human being in 
the government we’ve met person- 
ally, this Mr. Storku. Two, we 

15 



have to select a representative 
from among us. Three, this repre- 
sentative has to see Mr. Storku 
and lay the facts before him. How 
his government managed some- 
how to communicate with our 
government the fact that time 
travel was possible, but only if 
certain physical laws were taken 
into consideration, most particu- 
larly the law of — the law of — 
What is that law, Pollock?” 

“Conservation of energy and 
mass. If you want to transfer five 
people from 2458 to 1958, you 
have to replace them simultane- 
ously in their own time with five 
people of exactly the same struc- 
ture and mass from the time 
they’re going to. Otherwise, you’d 
have a gap in the mass of one 
space-time continuum and a cor- 
responding surplus in the other. 
It’s like a chemical equation — ” 

“I’m not a student in one of 
your classes. You don’t have to 
impress me, Pollock,” Mr. Mead 
said. “Thank you for the explana- 
tion.” 

“Who was trying to impress 
you?” Pollock demanded belliger- 
ently. “I just tried to clear up 
something you seemed to have a 
lot of trouble understanding. 
That’s at the bottom of our prob- 
lem: the law of the conservation 
of energy and mass. And the way 
the machine’s been set for all five 
of us and all five of them, nobody 
can do anything about transfer- 



ring unless all of us and all of 
them are present at both ends of 
the connection at the very same 
moment.” 

“All right,” Mr. Mead said. “All 
right! Thank you very much for 
your lesson, but now, if you don’t 
mind, I’d like to go on. Some of 
us aren’t civil service workers. 
Our time is valuable.” 

“Listen to the tycoon, will you? 
His time is valuable. Look, Ollie, 
my friend, as long as Winthrop 
goes on being stubborn, we’re all 
stuck here together. And as long 
as we’re stuck here, we’re all 
greenhorns together in 2458. For 
your information, right now, your 
time is my time, and vice versa.” 
“Sh-h-h!” Mrs. Brucks com- 
manded. “Be nice. Go on talking, 
Mr. Mead. It’s very interesting. 
Isn’t it interesting, Miss Carth- 
ington?” 

The blonde girl nodded. “It 
sure is. They don’t make people 
executives for nothing. You put 
things so — so right, Mr. Mead.” 

O LIVER T. MEAD, somewhat 
mollified, smiled a slender 
thanks at her. “Three, then. We 
lay the facts before this Mr. 
Storku. We tell him how we came 
in good faith, after we were se- 
lected by a nationwide contest to 
find the exact opposite numbers 
of the five people from his time.

osity to see what the future looks 
like, and partly out of patriotism. 
Yes, patriotism! For is not this 
America of 2458 our America, 
however strange and inexplicable 
the changes in it? As patriots, we 
could follow no other course. As 
patriots, we — ” 

“Oh, for God’s sake!” the high 
school teacher exploded. “You’re 
no subversive, all right? What’s 
your idea?” 

There was a long silence in the 
room while the stout middle-aged 
man went through a pantomime 
of fighting for control. “Pollock, if 
you don’t want to hear what I 
have to say, you can always take 
a breather in the hall! As I was 
saying, having explained the 
background facts to Mr. Storku, 
we come to point four, the fact 
that Winthrop refuses to return 
with us. And we demand — do you 
hear me? — we demand that the 
American government of this time 
take the appropriate steps to in- 
sure our safe return to our own 
era even if it involves — well, 
martial law relative to Winthrop.” 

“Is that your idea?” Dave Pol- 
lock asked derisively. “What if 
Storku says no?” 

“He can’t say no if it’s put to 
him with authority. We are Ameri- 
can citizens. We demand our 
rights. If he won’t recognize our 
citizenship, we demand to be sent 
back where we came from. He 
can’t refuse. We explain the risks 



his government runs: loss of good 
will, irreparable damage to future 
contacts between the two eras, his 
government standing convicted of 
a breach of faith— that sort of 
thing. It’s just a matter of finding 
the right words and making them 
good and strong.” 

Mrs. Brucks nodded agreement 
“Absolutely. You can do it, Mr. 
Mead.” 

The stout man seemed jolted 

“I?” 

“Of course!” Mary Ann Carth- 
ington said enthusiastically. 
“Just like you said, Mr. Mead, it 
has to be said good and strong. 
That’s the way you can say it.” 
“I’d — well, I’d rather not. I 
don’t think I’m the best one for 
the job. Storku and I don’t get 
along too well. Somebody else, I 
think, would be — ” 

TkAVE POLLOCK laughed. 

“Now don’t be modest, Ollie. 
You get along with Storku as well 
as any of us. You’re elected. Be- 
sides, isn’t this public relations 
work? You’re a big man in public 
relations.” 

Mr. Mead tried to pour all the 
hatred in the Universe at him in 
one long look. Then he shot out 
his cuffs and straightened his 
shoulders. “Very well. If none of 
you feel up to the job, I’ll take it 
on myself. Be back soon.” 

“Jumper, Ollie?” Pollock asked. 
“It’s faster.”

“No, thank you,” Mr. Mead 
said curtly. “I’ll walk. I need the 
exercise.” 

He hurried through the corri- 
dor and toward the staircase. 
Though he went down them at a 
springy executive trot, the stairs 
seemed to feel he wasn’t going 
fast enough. An escalator motion 
began, growing more and more 
rapid, until he stumbled and al- 
most fell. 

“Stop, dammit!” he yelled. “I 
can do this myself!” 

The stairs immediately stopped 
flowing downward. He wiped his 
face with a large white handker- 
chief and started down again. 
After a few moments, the stairs 
turned into an escalator once 
more. 

Again and again, he had to or- 
der them to stop; again and again, 
they obeyed him, and then sneak- 
ily tried to help him along. He 
seethingly gave up forbidding the 
stairs to assist him, and when he 
reached ground level, he was 
moving so fast that he rocketed 
out of the empty lobby of the 
building and onto the sidewalk. 
He might have broken a leg or 
dislocated his back. 

Fortunately, the sidewalk be- 
gan moving under him. As he 
tottered from right to left, the 
sidewalk did so, too, gently but 
expertly keeping him balanced. 
He finally got his footing and 
took a couple of deep breaths. 



Under him, the sidewalk trem- 
bled slightly, waiting for him to 
choose a direction so that it could 
help. 

Mr. Mead looked around des- 
perately. There was no one in 
sight along the broad avepue in 
either direction. 

“What a world!” he moaned. 
“What a loony-bin of a world! 
You’d think there’d be a cop — 
somebody!” 

Suddenly there was somebody. 
There was the pop-pop of a jump- 
er mechanism in operation slightly 
overhead and a man appeared 
some twelve feet in the air. Be- 
hind him, there was an orange 
hedgelike affair, covered with 
eyes. 

A PORTION of the sidewalk 
J -*- formed a mound under the 
two creatures and lowered them 
gently to surface level. 

“Listen!” Mr. Mead yelled. “Am 
I glad I ran into you! I’m trying 
to get to the State Department 
and I’m having trouble. I’d ap- 
preciate a little assistance — ” 

“Sorry,” the other man said. 
“Klap-Lillth and I will have to be 
back on Ganymede in a half-hour. 
We’re late for an appointment as 
is. Why don’t you call a govern- 
ment machine?” 

“Who is he?” the orange hedge 
inquired as they began to move 
swiftly to the entrance of a build- 
ing, the sidewalk under them 



18

flowing like a happy river. “He 
doesn’t narga to me like one of 
you.” 

“Time traveler,” his companion 
explained. “From the past. One of 
the exchange tourists who came 
in two weeks ago.” 

“Aha!” said the hedge. “From 
the past. No wonder I couldn’t 
narga him. It’s just as well. You 
know, on Ganymede we don’t be- 
lieve in time travel. It’s against 
our religion.” 

The Earthman chuckled and 
dug the hedge in the twigs with 
his elbow. “You and your reli- 
gion! When was the last time you 
attended a shkootseem cere- 
mony?” 

“Not since the last syzygy of 
Jupiter and the Sun,” the hedge 
admitted. “But that’s not the 
point. I’m still in good standing. 
What all you humans fail to un- 
derstand about the Ganymedan 
religion . .” 

His rustling voice trailed off as 
they disappeared inside the build- 
ing. Mead almost spat after them. 
Then he recollected himself. It 
was two o’clock. He didn’t have 
much time to fool around — be- 
sides, he was in a strange world 
with customs insanely different 
from his own and who knew what 
the penalties were for spitting? 

“I want a government ma- 
chine,” he said resignedly to the 
empty air. 

He felt a little foolish, but that 



was what they had been told to 
do in any emergency. And, sure 
enough, a gleaming affair of wires 
and coils and multi-colored plates 
appeared beside him. 

“Yes?” a toneless voice in- 
quired. “Service needed?” 

“I’m on my way to see Mr. 
Storku at our Department of 
State,” Mr. Mead explained, star- 
ing suspiciously at the largest coil 
near him, “and I’m having trouble 
walking on the sidewalk. I’m lia- 
ble to fall and kill myself if it 
doesn’t stop moving under me.” 
“Sorry, sir, but no one has 
fallen on a sidewalk for at least 
two hundred years. May I suggest 
you take a jumper?” 

“I don’t want to take a jumper. 
I want to walk. All you have to 
do is tell this damn sidewalk to 
relax and be quiet.” 

“Sorry, sir,” the machine re- 
plied, “but the sidewalk has its 
job to do. Besides, Mr. Storku is 
not at his office. He is taking some 
spiritual exercise at either Shriek 
Field or Panic Stadium.” 

“Oh, no!” Mr. Mead groaned. 
His worst fears had been realized. 
He didn’t want to go to those 
places again. 

“Sorry, sir, but he is. Just a mo- 
ment while I check.” There were 
bright blue flashes among the 
coils. “Yes, Mr. Storku is doing a 
shriek today. He feels he has been 
over-aggressive recently. He in- 
vites you to join him.”

]%/T R. MEAD considered. He 
was n9t the slightest bit in- 
terested in going to one of those 
places where sane people became 
madmen for a couple of hours. 
On the other hand, time was short 
and Winthrop was still stubborn. 

“All right,” he said unhappily. 
“I’ll join him.” 

“Shall I call a jumper, sir?” 

The portly man stepped back. 
“No! I’ll - I’ll walk.” 

“Sorry, sir, but you would never 
get there before the shriek has 
begun.” 

Sweetbottom’s vice-president in 
charge of public relations worked 
hard to calm himself. He must re- 
member that this was just a ma- 
chine into whose circuits a given 
set of vocal reactions had been 
built. If he had an apoplectic fit 
in front of it, it would merely 
summon another machine, a med- 
ical one. All you could do was 
give it information or receive in- 
formation from it. 

“I-dorit-like- jumpers,” he said 
between his teeth. 

“Sorry, sir, but you expressed a 
desire to see Mr. Storku. If you 
are willing to wait until the shriek 
is over, there is no problem, ex- 
cept that you would be well ad- 
vised to start immediately for the 
Odor Festival on Venus, where 
he is going next. If you wish to 
see him now, however, you must 
take a jumper. There are no other 
possibilities, sir, unless you feel 



that my memory circuits are in- 
adequate or you’d like to add a 
new factor to the discussion.” 
Mr. Mead sagged. “Okay, okay! 
Call a jumper.” 

“Yes, sir. Here you are, sir.” 
The empty cylinder that sudden- 
ly materialized over Mr. Mead’s 
head caused him to start, but 
while he was opening his mouth 
to say, “Hey! I changed my — ” it 
slid down over him. 

There was darkness. He felt as 
if his stomach were being gently 
but insistently pulled out through 
his mouth. His liver, spleen and 
lungs seemed to follow suit. Then 
the bones of his body all fell in- 
ward to the center of his now- 
empty abdomen and dwindled in 
size until they disappeared. He 
collapsed upon himself. 

Abruptly he was whole and 
solid again and standing in a 
large green meadow, with dozens 
of people around him. His stom- 
ach returned to its proper place 
and squirmed irritatedly back in- 
to position. 

changed my mind. I’ll walk 
after all,” he said, and threw up. 

CTORKU, a tall, genial, yellow- 
^ haired young man, was stand- 
ing in front of him when the 
spasms had subsided. “It’s such a 
simple thing, really, Mr. Mead. 
Just a matter of being intently 
placid during the jump.” 

“Easy— easy to say,” Mr. Mead 



20

gasped. What was the reason 
Storku always exuded such pa- 
tronizing contempt toward him? 
“Why don’t you people — why 
don’t you people find another way 
to travel? In my time, comfort in 
transportation is the keystone, the 
very keystone of the industry. 
Any railroad, busline or airline 
which doesn’t see to it that their 
passengers enjoy maximum com- 
fort is out of business before you 
can bat an eye. Either that or 
they have a new board of direc- 
tors.” 

66T SN’T he intriguing?” a girl 
-*• near him said to her es- 
cort. “He talks just like one of 
those historical romances.” 

Mr. Mead glanced at her sourly, 
then gulped. She was nude. For 
that matter, so was everyone else 
around him, including Mr. Storku. 
Who, he wondered nervously, 
knew what went on at these 
Shriek Field affairs? After all, he 
had only seen them before from 
a distance in the grandstand. And 
now he was right in the middle of 
these deliberate lunatics. 

“Surely you’re being a bit un- 
just,” Mr. Storku suggested. “If 
an Elizabethan Englishman or a 
man from the Classic Greek pe- 
riod were to go for a ride in one 
of your horseless carriages or iron 
horses — to use your vernacular — 
he would exhibit much more dis- 
comfort than you have. It’s purely 



a matter of adjustment to the un- 
familiar. Some adjust, like your 
contemporary Winthrop; some 
don’t, like yourself.” 

“Speaking of Winthrop — ” Mr. 
Mead began hurriedly, glad of 
the opening. 

“Everybody here?” an athletic 
young man burst in as he bounded 
up. “I’m your leader for this 
shriek. On your feet, everybody, 
come on, let’s get those kinks out 
of our muscles. We’re going to 
have a real fine shriek — all it 
takes is teamwork!” 

“Take your clothes off,” the 
government man told Mr. Mead. 
“You can’t run a shriek dressed. 
Especially dressed like that.” 

Mr. Mead shrank back. “I just 
came here to talk to you. I’ll 
watch.” 

A rich, roaring laugh from 
Storku. “You can’t watch from 
the middle of Shriek Field! And 
besides, the moment you joined 
us, you were automatically regis- 
tered for the shriek. If you with- 
draw now, you’ll throw everything 
off.” 

“I will?” 

“Of course. A different quan- 
tity of stimuli has to be applied 
to any different quantity of peo- 
ple, if you want to develop a spe- 
cific shriek-intensity in each one 
of them. Take your clothes off, 
man, and get into the thing. It 
will tone up your psyche mag- 
nificently.”

-L” then began to undress. He 
was embarrassed, miserable and 
more than a little frightened at 
the prospect, but he had an ur- 
gent job of public relations to do 
on the yellow-haired young man. 

In his time, he had gurgled 
pleasurably over ropelike cigars 
given him by politicians, gotten 
drunk in ghastly little bars with 
important newspapermen, and 
suffered the slings and the arrows

Rome . 

And obviously the crowd he 
had made this trip with from 
1958 was composed of bunglers. 
They’d never get themselves and 
him back to their own time, back 
to a world where there was a 
supply-and-demand system that 
made sense. A world where an 
important business executive was 
treated like somebody, where the 
walls didn’t ripple around you, 
the furniture didn’t adjust con- 
stantly under you, where the very 
clothes on a person’s back didn’t 
change from moment to moment 
as if being revolved in a kaleido- 
scope. 

No, it was up to him to get 
everybody back to that world and 
his only channel of effective op- 
eration lay through Storku. There- 

22 



fore, Storku had to be placated 
and made to feel that Oliver T. 
Mead was one of the boys. 

Besides, it occurred to him as 
he began slipping out of his 
clothes, some of these girls looked 
real cute. They reminded him of 
the Septic Tank Convention at 
Des Moines back in July. If only 
they didn’t shave their heads! 

“All together, now,” the shriek 
leader sang out. “Let’s bunch up. 
All together in a tight little group, 
all bunched up and milling 
around.” 

Mr. Mead was pushed and jos- 
tled into the crowd. It surged for- 
ward, back, right, left, being ma- 
neuvered into a smaller and 
smaller group under the instruc- 
tions and shoving of the shriek 
leader. Music sprang up around 
them — more noise than music, ac- 
tually, since it had no discernible 
harmonic relationships and grew 
louder and louder until it was al- 
most deafening. 

Someone striving for balance 
hit Mr. Mead in the stomach with 
an outflung arm. He said “Oof!” 
and then “Oof!” again as someone 
behind him piled into his back. 

“Watch out!” a girl near him 
moaned as he trod on her foot. 

“Sorry,” he told her, “I just 
couldn’t — ” and then an elbow hit 
him in the eye and he went lurch- 
ing away a few steps, until, the 
group changing its direction again, 
he was pushed forward. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



T> OUND and round he went on 
-*-*■ the grass, being pushed and 
pushing, the horrible noise almost 
tearing his eardrums apart. From 
what seemed a greater and great- 
er distance, he could hear the 
shriek leader chanting: “Come on, 
this way, hurry up! No, that way, 
around that tree. Back into the 
bunch, you. Stay together. Now, 
backward, that’s right, backward. 
Faster, faster.” 

They went backward, a great 
mass of people pushing on Mead, 
jamming him into the great mass 
of people immediately behind 
him. Then, abruptly, they went 
forward again, a dozen little cross- 
currents of humanity at work 
against each other in the crowd, 
so that as well as moving forward, 
he was also being hurled a few 
feet to the right and then turned 
around and being yanked back 
diagonally to his left. Once or 
twice, he was shot to the out- 
skirts of the group, but, much to 
his surprise, all he did was claw 
his way back into the jam-packed 
surging middle. 

It was as if he belonged no- 
where else but in this mob of 
hurrying madmen. A shaved fe- 
male head crashing into his chest, 
as the only hint that the group 
had changed its direction, was 
what he had come to expect. He 
threw himself back and disre- 
garded the grunts and yelps he 
helped create. He was part of this 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



— this — whatever it was. He was 
hysterical, bruised and slippery 
with sweat, but he no longer 
thought about anything but stay- 
ing on his feet in the mob. 

He was part of it and that was 
all he knew. 

Suddenly, somewhere outside 
the maelstrom of running, jostling 
naked bodies, there was a yell. It 
was a long yell, in a powerful 
male voice, and it went on and on, 
almost drowning out the noise- 
music. A woman in front of Mr. 
Mead picked it up in a head- 
rattling scream. The man who 
had been yelling stopped, and, 
after a while, so did the woman. 

Then Mr. Mead heard the yell 
again, heard the woman join in, 
and was not even remotely aston- 
ished to hear his own voice add to 
the din. He threw all the frustra- 
tion of the past two weeks into 
that yell, all the pounding, shov- 
ing and bruises of the past few 
minutes, all the frustrations and 
hatreds of his lifetime. 

All around him, others were 
joining it, too, until at last there 
was a steady, unanimous shriek 
from the tight mob that slipped 
and fell and chased itself all over 
the green meadow. Mr. Mead, in 
the back of his mind, experienced 
a childlike satisfaction in getting 
onto the rhythm they were work- 
ing out — and in being part of 
working it out. 

It went pulse-beat, pulse-beat, 

23 



shriek-k-k-k, pulse - beat, pulse - 
beat, shriek-k-k-k. 

All together. All around him, 
all together. It was good! 

He was unable to figure out 
how long they had been running 
and yelling, when he noticed that 
he was no longer in the middle of 
a tight group. They were spread 
out over the meadow in a long, 
wavering, yelling line. 

TT E FELT a little confused. 
A J. Without losing a beat in the 
shriek-rhythm, he made an effort 
to get closer to a man and woman 
on his right. 

The yells stopped abruptly. 
The noise-music stopped abruptly. 
He stared straight ahead where 
everybody else was staring. He 
saw it, a brown, furry animal 
about the size of a sheep. It had 
thrown one startled, frightened 
look at them. Then it had begun 
running madly away across the 
meadow. 

“Let’s get it!” the shriek lead- 
er’s voice sounded from what 
seemed all about them. 

The shriek started again, a con- 
tinuous, unceasing shriek, and Mr. 
Mead joined in. He was running 
across the meadow after the furry 
brown animal, screaming his head 
off, dimly and proudly conscious 
of fellow human beings doing the 
same on both sides of him. 

Let’s get it, his mind howled. 
Let’s get it, let’s get it! 



Almost caught up with, the ani- 
mal dodged back through the 
line of people. Mr. Mead flung 
himself at it and made a grab. He 
got a handful of fur and fell pain- 
fully to his knees as the animal 
galloped away. 

He was on his feet without 
abating a single note of the shriek 
and after it in a moment. Every- 
one else had turned around and 
was running with him. 

Let’s get it! Let’s get it! Let’s 
get it! 

Back and forth across the 
meadow, the animal ran and they 
pursued. It dodged and twisted 
and jerked itself free from con- 
verging groups. 

Mr. Mead ran with them, ran 
in the very forefront. Shrieking. 

No matter how the furry brown 
animal turned, they turned, too. 
They kept getting closer and 
closer to it. 

Finally, the entire mob trapped 
it in a great, uneven circle and 
closed in. Mr. Mead was the first 
one to reach it. He knocked it 
down with a single blow. A girl 
leaped onto it and began tearing 
at it with her fingernails. Just be- 
fore everyone piled on, Mr. Mead 
managed to grab a furry brown 
leg. He gave it a tremendous 
wrench and it came off in his 
hand. He was distantly surprised 
by the loose wires and gear mech- 
anisms that trailed out of the 
torn-off leg. 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“We got it!” he mumbled, star- 
ing at the leg. We got it, his mind 
danced madly. We got it, we got 
it! 

He was suddenly very tired, al- 
most faint. He dragged himself 
away from the crowd and sat 
down heavily on the grass. He 
continued to stare at the loose 
wires that came out of the leg. 

Someone came up to him, 
breathing hard. “Well,” puffed Mr. 
Storku. “Did you have a nice 
shriek?” 

Mr. Mead held up the furry 
brown leg. “We got it,” he said 
bewilderedly. 

HP HE yellow-haired young man 
-*■ laughed. “You need a good 
shower and a good sedative. 
Come on.” He helped Mr. Mead 
to his feet and, holding on to his 
arm, walked him across the mea- 
dow to a dilated yellow square 
under the grandstand. All around 
them, the other participants in 
the shriek chattered gaily to each 
other as they cleansed themselves 
and readjusted their metabolism. 

After his turn inside one of the 
many booths which filled the inte- 
rior of the grandstand, Mr. Mead 
felt more like himself —which was 
not to say he felt better. 

Something had come out of 
him in those last few moments as 
he tore at the mechanical quarry, 
something he wished infinitely 
had stayed at the dank bottom of 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



his soul. He’d rather never have 
known it existed. 

He felt vaguely, dismally, like 
a man who, flipping the pages of 
a textbook of aberrations, comes 
upon a particularly ugly case his- 
tory which parallels his life his- 
tory in every respect and under- 
stands — in a single, horrified flash 
— exactly what all those seem- 
ingly innocent quirks of his per- 
sonality mean. 

He tried to remind himself that 
he was still Oliver T. Mead, a 
good husband and father, a re- 
spected business executive, a sub- 
stantial pillar of the community 
and the local church — but it was 
no help. Now, and for the rest of 
his life, he was also . this other 
thing. 

He had to get into some clothes. 
Fast. 

Mr. Storku understood immedi- 
ately. “You probably had a lot 
saved up. About time you began 
discharging it. I wouldn’t worry: 
you’re as sane as anyone in your 
period. But your clothes have 
been cleaned off the field along 
with all the rubbish of our shriek; 
the officials are already preparing 
for the next one.” 

“What do I do?” Mr. Mead 
wailed. “I can’t go home like 
this.” 

“No?” the government man in- 
quired with a good deal of curi- 
osity. “You really can’t? Fascinat- 
ing! Well, just step under that 

25 



outfitter there. I suppose you’d 
like twentieth-century costume?” 

Mr. Mead placed himself 
doubtfully under the indicated 
mechanism as a newly clad citi- 
zen of twenty-fifth-century Amer- 
ica walked away from it. “Yes. 
But please make it something 
sane, something I can wear.” 

TTE WATCHED as his host ad- 
justed the dials. There was a 
slight hum from the machine 
overhead: a complete set of for- 
mal black - and - white evening 
wear sprang into being on the 
stout man’s body. In a moment, it 
had changed into another outfit: 
the shoes grew upward and be- 
came hip-length rubber boots, the 
dinner jacket lengthened itself in- 
to a sou’wester. Mr. Mead was 
perfectly dressed for the bridge of 
any whaling ship. 

“Stop it!” he begged distract- 
edly as the sou’wester began 
showing distinctive sports shirt 
symptoms. “Keep it down to one 
thing!” 

“You could do it yourself," Mr. 
Storku pointed out, “if your sub- 
conscious didn’t heave about so 
much.” Nonetheless, he good-na- 
turedly poked at the machine 
again and Mr. Mead’s clothes 
subsided into the tweed jacket 
and golf knickers that had been 
so popular in the 1920s. They 
held fast at that. 

“Better?” 



“I — I guess so.” Mr. Mead 
frowned as he looked down at 
himself. It certainly was a queer 
outfit for a vice-president of 
Sweetbottom Septic Tanks, Inc., 
to return to his own time in, but 
at least it was one outfit. And as 
soon as he got home — 

He took a deep breath. “Now 
look here, Storku,” he said, put- 
ting aside the recent obscene 
memories of himself with as much 
determination as he could call up. 
“We’re having trouble with this 
Winthrop fellow. He won’t go 
back with us.” 

They walked outside and 
paused on the edge of the mead- 
ow. In the distance, a new shriek 
was being organized. 

“That so?” Mr. Storku asked 
with no very great interest. He 
pointed at the ragged mob of 
nude figures just beginning to jos- 
tle each other into a tight bunch. 
“You know, two or three more 
sessions out there and your psy- 
che would be in fine shape. Al- 
though, from the looks of you, I’d 
say Panic Stadium would be even 
better. Why don’t you go right 
over there? One first-rate, scream- 
ing, headlong panic and you’d be 
absolutely — ” 

“Thank you, but my psyche is 
my own affair!” 

The yellow-haired young man 
nodded seriously. “Obviously. The 
adult individual’s psyche is under 
no other jurisdiction than that of 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the adult individual concerned. 
The Covenant of 2314, adopted 
by unanimous consent of the en- 
tire population of the United 
States of America. Later, of 
course, broadened by the interna- 
tional plebiscite of 2337 to in- 
clude the entire world. But I was 
just making a friendly sugges- 
tion.” 

Mr. Mead forced himself to 
smile. He was distressed to find 
that when he smiled, the lapels of 
his jacket stood up and caressed 
the sides of his chin affectionately. 
“No offense, no offense. It’s just 
that I’ve had all I want of this 
nonsense. But what are you go- 
ing to do about Winthrop?” 

“Do? Why, nothing. What can 
we do?” 

“You can force him to go back! 
You represent the government, 
don’t you? The government in- 
vited us here, the government is 
responsible for our safety.” 

S TORKU looked puzzled. 
“Aren’t you safe?” 

“You know what I mean, 
Storku. Our safe return. The gov- 
ernment is responsible for it.” 
“Force may never be applied 
to a mature citizen and even offi- 
cial persuasion may be resorted to 
only in rare and carefully speci- 
fied instances. This is certainly 
not one of them. By the time a 
child has gone through our edu- 
cational system, he or she is a 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



well-balanced member of society 
who can be trusted to do what- 
ever is socially necessary. From 
that point on, government ceases 
to take an active role in the indi- 
vidual’s life.” 

“But Winthrop isn’t a citizen of 
your world, Storku. He didn’t go 
through your educational system, 
didn’t have these psychological 
things, these readjustment courses, 
every couple of years, and didn’t—” 

“But he came here as our in- 
vited guest,” Mr. Storku pointed 
out. “And, as such, he’s entitled to 
the full protection of our laws.” 

“And we aren’t, I suppose!” Mr. 
Mead shouted. “He can do what- 
ever he wants to us and get away 
with it. Do you call that law? Do 
you call that justice? I don’t. Red- 
tape bureaucracy, that’s all it is!” 

The yellow-haired young man 
put his hand on Mr. Mead’s 
shoulder. “Listen, my friend, and 
try to understand. If Winthrop 
tried to do anything to you, it 
would be stopped. Not by inter- 
fering with Winthrop directly, but 
by removing you from his neigh- 
borhood. In order for us to take 
even such limited action, he’d 
have to do. That would be com- 
mission of an act interfering with 
your rights as an individual. What 
Winthrop is accused of, however, 
is omission of an act. He refuses 
to go back with you. Well, now. 
He has a right to refuse to do 
anything with his own body and 

77 



mind. The Covenant of 2314 cov- 
ers that in so many words. Would 
you like me to quote the relevant 
passage to you?” 

“No, I would not like you to 
quote the relevant passage to me. 
So you’re trying to say that no- 
body can do anything, is that it? 
Winthrop can keep all of us from 
getting back to our own time, but 
you can’t do anything about it 
and we can’t do anything about 
it. One hell of a note.” 

“An interesting phrase, that,” 
Mr. Storku commented. “If there 
had only been an etymologist or 
linguist in your group, I would en- 
joy discussing it with him. Your 
conclusion, though, at least in re- 
gard to this particular situation, is 
substantially correct. There is 
only one thing you can do — you 
can try to persuade Winthrop. Up 
to the last moment of the sched- 
uled transfer, that, of course, al- 
ways exists as a possible solution.” 

1VT R. MEAD brushed down his 
1"-*- overly emotional jacket la- 
pels. “And if we don’t, we’re out 
of luck? We can’t take him by 
the scruff of the neck and — and — ” 
“I’m afraid you can’t. A gov- 
ernment machine or manufac- 
tured government official would 
appear on the scene and liberate 
him. Without any damage to your 
persons, you understand.” 

“No damage,” Mr. Mead 
brooded. “Just leaving us stuck in 

28 



this asylum for the rest of our 
lives, no ifs, no ands, no buts.” 

Mr. Storku looked hurt. “Oh, 
come now! It may be very differ- 
ent from your own culture ir 
many ways. It may be uncom- 
fortably alien in its artifacts and 
underlying philosophy. But surely 
there are compensations. For the 
loss of the old in terms of family, 
associates and experiences, there 
must be a gain in the new and 
exciting. Your Winthrop has found 
it so — he’s at Panic Stadium or 
Shriek Field at least every other 
day; I’ve run into him at seminars 
and salons three times in the past 
ten days; and I hear from the 
Bureau of Home Appliances of 
the Department of Internal Eco- 
nomics that he’s a steady, enthu- 
siastic and thoroughly dedicated 
consumer. What he can bring 
himself to do — ” 

“Sure he gets all those gadgets,” 
Mr. Mead sneered. “He doesn’t 
have to pay for them. A lazy re- 
lief jack like him couldn’t ask for 
anything better. What a world — 
gahhh!” 

“My only point,” Mr. Storku 
continued equably, “is that being 
‘stuck in this asylum,’ as you 
rather vividly picture it, has its 
positive aspects. And since there 
appears to be a distinct possi- 
bility of this occurring, it would 
seem logical for you people to be- 
gin investigating these positive as- 
pects somewhat more wholeheart- 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



edly than you have, instead of re- 
treating to the security of each 
other’s company and such twen- 
tieth-century anachronisms as you 
are able to recreate.” 

“We have — all we cared to. 
What we want now, all of us, is 
to go home and to keep on living 
the lives we were born into. So 
what it comes down to is that no- 
body and nothing can help us 
with Winthrop, eh?” 

Mr. Storku called for a jumper 
and held up a hand to arrest the 
huge cylinder in the air as soon 
as it appeared. 

“I wouldn’t want to go as far as 
that without conducting a thor- 
ough personal investigation of the 
matter. It’s entirely possible that 
someone or something in the Gal- 
axy could help you if the prob- 
lem were brought to its attention 
and if it were sufficiently inter- 
ested. It’s rather a large, well- 
populated galaxy, you know. All 
I can say definitely is that the 
Department of State can’t help 
you.” 

Mr. Mead pushed his finger- 
nails deep into his palms and 
ground his teeth together. “You 
couldn’t possibly,” he asked at 
last, very, very slowly, “be just a 
little more specific in telling us 
where to go for help next? We 
have less than two hours left — 
and we won’t be able to cover 
very much of the Galaxy in that 
time.” 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



44 A GOOD point,” Mr. Storku 
said approvingly. “I’m glad 
to see that you have calmed down 
and are at last thinking clearly 
and resourcefully. Now who — in 
this immediate neighborhood — 
might be able to work out the so- 
lution of an insoluble problem? 
Well, first there’s the Temporal 
Embassy, which handled the ex- 
change and brought you people 
here. They have all kinds of con- 
nections; they can, if they feel 
like it, tap the total ingenuity of 
the human race for the next five 
thousand years. The trouble is, 
they take too much of the long 
view for my taste. 

“Then there are the Oracle Ma- 
chines which will give you the 
answer to any question that can 
be answered. The problem there, 
of course, is interpreting the an- 
swer correctly. Then, on Pluto, 
there’s a convention this week of 
vector psychologists. If anyone 
could figure out a way of persuad- 
ing Winthrop to change his mind, 
they can. Unfortunately, the dom- 
inant field of interest in vector 
psychology at the moment is fetal 
education; I’m afraid they’d find 
your Winthrop far too mature a 
specimen. Then, out around Rigel, 
there’s a race of remarkably pre- 
scient fungi whom I can recom- 
mend from personal experience. 
They have a most unbelievable 
talent for — ” 

Mr. Mead waggled a frantic 

29 



hand at him. “That’s enough! 
That’s plenty to go on for a 
while! We only have two hours — 
remember?” 

“I certainly do. And since it’s 
very unlikely that you can do 
anything about it in so short a 
time, may I suggest that you drop 
the whole matter and take this 
jumper with me to Venus? There 
won’t be another Odor Festival 
there for sixty-six years. It’s an 
experience, my friend, that should 
not be missed. Venus always does 
these things right: the greatest 
odor-emitters in the Universe will 
be there. And I’ll be very happy 
to explain all the fine points to 
you. Coming?” 

Mr. Mead dodged out of the 
way of the jumper which Mr. 
Storku was gesturing down invit- 
ingly. “No, thank you! Why is it,” 
he complained when he had re- 
treated to a safe distance, “that 
you people are always taking va- 
cations, always going off some- 
where to relax and enjoy your- 
selves? How the hell does any 
work ever get done in this cock- 
eyed world?” 

“Oh, it gets done,” the yellow- 
haired young man laughed as the 
cylinder began to slide down over 
him. “Whenever there’s some- 
thing that only a human being 
can do, one of us — the nearest re- 
sponsible individual with the ap- 
propriate training — takes care of 
it. But our personality goals are 

30 



different from yours. In the words 
of the proverb: All play and no 
work makes Jack a full boy.” 

And he was gone. 

So Mr. Mead went back to Mrs. 
Bracks’ room and told the others 
that the Department of State, rep- 
resented by Mr. Storku, couldn’t 
help them with Winthrop’s stub- 
bornness. 

|%/T ARY ANN CARTHING- 
TON tightened the curl of 
her blonde hair with a business- 
like forefinger while she consid- 
ered the matter. “You told him 
all that you told us, and he still 
wouldn’t do anything, Mr. Mead? 
Are you sure he knows who you 
are?” 

Mr. Mead didn’t bother to an- 
swer her. He had other problems. 
Not only was his spirit badly 
bruised and scratched by his re- 
cent experiences, but his golf 
knickers had just woken into sen- 
tiency. And whereas the jacket 
merely had attempted to express 
its affection by trying to cuddle 
under his chin, the knickers went 
in more for a kind of patrolling 
action. Up and down on his thighs 
they rippled; back and forth 
across his rear they marched. 

“Sure Storku knows who he is,” 
Dave Pollock told her. “Ollie 
waved his vice-presidency in his 
face, but Storku heard that Sweet- 
bottom Septic Tanks Preferred 
fell to the bottom of the stock 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



market just 481 years ago today, 
so he wasn’t afraid of him or 
much impressed.” 

“I don’t think that’s funny,” 
Mary Ann Carthington said, and 
shook her head at him once in a 
“so there!” gesture. She knew 
that old beanpole of a school- 
teacher was just jealous of Mr. 
Mead, but she wasn’t sure whether 
it was because he didn’t make as 
much money or because he wasn’t 
nearly as distinguished - looking. 
But if a big executive like Mr. 
Mead couldn’t get them out of 
this jam, then nobody could. And 
that would be awful, positively 
awful. 

She would never get back to 
San Francisco and Edgar Rapp. 
And while Edgar might not be 
everything a girl like Mary Ann 
wanted, she was quite willing to 
settle for him at this point. He 
worked hard and made a good 
living. His compliments were 
nothing much, true, but at least 
he could be counted on not to say 
anything that tore a person into 
worthless bits right before their 
very eyes, like somebody she 
could mention. And the sooner 
she could leave the twenty-fifth 
century and be forever away from 
that somebody, the better. 

“Now, Mr. Mead,” she cooed 
insistently, “I’m sure he told you 
something we could do. He didn’t 
tell you to give up hope com- 
pletely and absolutely, did he?” 

TIME WAITS FOR W I NT HR OP 



r T , HE executive caught the strap 
■*- end of his knickers as it came 
unbuckled and started rolling ex- 
ultantly up his leg. He glared at 
her out of eyes that had seen just 
too damn much, that felt things 
had gone just too damn far. 

“He told me something we 
could do,” he said with careful 
viciousness. “He said the Tempo- 
ral Embassy could help us. All we 
need is somebody with pull in the 
Temporal Embassy.” 

Mary Ann Carthington almost 
bit the end off the lipstick she 
was applying at that moment. 
Mrs. Brucks and Dave Pollock 
had both turned to stare at her. 
And she knew just exactly what 
they were thinking. 

“Well, I certainly don’t — ” she 
started to protest. 

“Don’t be modest, Mary Ann,” 
Dave Pollock interrupted. “This 
is your big chance — and right 
now, it looks like our only chance. 
We’ve got about an hour and a 
half left. Get yourself into a 
jumper, skedaddle out there and 
turn on the charm!” 

Mrs. Brucks sat down beside 
her and gave her shoulders the 
benefit of a heavy maternal arm. 
“Listen, Miss Carthington, some- 
times we have to do things, it’s 
not so easy. But stuck here is bet-

spread her hands— “a touch here 
with the powder puff, a touch 
there with the lipstick, a this, a

that, and believe me, he won’t 
know what to do first for you. 
Crazy about you he is already — 
you mean to say a little favor he 
wouldn’t do, if you asked him?” 

“You really think so?” The girl 
began to preen. “Well, maybe — ” 

“A pretty girl like you, a fellow 
like him, nothing to maybe about. 
What a man like Mr. Mead can’t 
accomplish, a woman has to do 
all the time. And a pretty girl like 
you can do it without lifting her 
little finger.” 

Mary Ann Carthington gave a 
nod of agreement to this female 
view of history and stood up with 
determination. Dave Pollock im- 
mediately called for a jumper. 
She stepped back as the great 
cylinder materialized in the room. 

“Do I have to?” she asked. 
“Those awful things, they’re so 
upsetting.” 

TUT E TOOK her arm and began 
working her under the jump- 
er with a series of gentle, urging 
tugs. “You can’t walk; we don’t 
have the time any more. Take my 
word, Mary Ann, this is D-day and 
H-hour. So be a good girl and get 
under there and — Hey, listen. A 
smart angle with the temporal su- 
pervisor might be about how his 
people will be stuck in our period 
if Winthrop goes on being stub- 
born. If anyone around here is re- 
sponsible for them, he is. So as 
soon as you get there — ”

“I don’t need you to tell me 
how to handle the temporal su- 
pervisor, Dave Pollock!” she said 
haughtily, flouncing under the 
jumper. “After all, he happens to 
be a friend of mine, not yours — a 
very good friend of mine!” 

“Sure,” Pollock groaned, “but 
you still have to convince the 
man. And all I’m suggesting—” 
He broke off as the cylinder slid 
the final distance down to the 
floor and disappeared with the 
girl inside. 

He turned back to the others 
who had been watching anxiously. 
“Well, that’s it,” he announced, 
flapping his arms with a broad, 
hopeless gesture. “That’s our very 
last hope. Her!” 

Mary Ann Carthington felt ex- 
actly like a Last Hope as she ma- 
terialized in the Temporal Em- 
bassy. 

She fought down the swimming 
nausea which always seemed to 
accompany jumper transportation 
and, shaking her head quickly, 
managed to draw a deep breath. 

As a means of getting places, 
the jumper certainly beat Edgar 
Rapp’s old Buick— if only it didn’t 
make you feel like a chocolate 
malted. That was the trouble with 
this era: every halfway nice thing 
in it had such unpleasant after- 
effects! 

The ceiling undulated over her 
head in the great rotunda where 
she was now standing and bulged 

34 



a huge purplish lump mwn at 
her. It still looked, she decided 
nervously, like a movie Louse 
chandelier about to fall. 

“Yes?” inquired the purplish 
lump politely. “Whom did you 
wish to see?” 

She moistened her lipstick, then 
squared her shoulders. You had to 
carry these things off with a cer- 
tain amount of poise; it just did 
not do to show nervousness be- 
fore a ceiling. 

“I came to see Gygyo — I mean 
is Mr. Gygyo Rablin in?” 

“Mr. Rablin is not at size at 
the moment. He will return in fif- 
teen minutes. Would you like to 
wait in his office? He has another 
visitor there.” 

]t/| ARY ANN CARTHING- 
TON thought swiftly. She 
didn’t entirely like the idea of an- 
other visitor, but maybe it would 
be for the best. The presence of a 
third party would be a restraining 
influence for both of them and 
would take a little of the inevita- 
ble edge off her coming back to 
Gygyo as a suppliant after what 
had happened between them. 

But what was this about his not 
being “at size”? These twenty- 
fifth-century people did so many 
positively weird things with them- 
selves! 

“Yes, I’ll wait in his office,” she 
told the ceiling. “Oh, you needn’t 
bother,” she said to the floor as it 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



began to ripple under her feet. “I 
know the way.” 

“No bother at all, miss,” the 
floor replied cheerfully, and con- 
tinued to carry her across the ro- 
tunda to Rablin’s private office. 
“It’s a pleasure.” 

Mary Ann sighed and shook 
her head. Some of these fixtures 
were so opinionated! She relaxed 
and let herself be carried along, 
taking out her compact on the 
way for a last quick check of her 
hair and face. 

But the glance at herself in the 
mirror evoked the memory again. 
She flushed and almost called for 
a jumper to fake her back to Mrs. 
Bracks’ room. No, she couldn’t — 
this was their last chance to get 
out of this world and back to 
their own. But damn Gygyo Rab- 
lin, anyway! 

A yellow square in the wall 
having dilated sufficiently, the 
floor carried her into Rablin’s pri- 
vate office and lay flat again. She 
looked around at the familiar sur- 
roundings. 

There was Gygyo’s desk, if you 
could call that odd, purring thing 
a desk. There was that peculiar 
squirmy couch that — 

She caught her breath. A young 
woman was lying on the couch, 
one of those horrible bald-headed 
women they had here. 

“Excuse me,” Mary Ann said in 
one fast breath. “I had no idea — 
I didn’t mean to—” 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



“That’s perfectly all right,” the 
young woman said, still appar- 
ently staring up at the ceiling. 
“You’re not intruding. I just 
dropped in on Gygyo myself. 
Have a seat.” 

The floor shot up a section of 
itself under Mary Ann and, when 
she was securely cradled in it, 
lowered itself slowly to sitting 
height. 

“You must be that twentieth 
century—” the young woman 
paused, then amended rapidly, 
“the visitor whom Gygyo has 
been seeing lately. My name’s 
Flurett. I’m just an old childhood 
friend — way back from Responsi- 
bility Group Three.” 

Mary Ann nodded primly. 
“How nice, I’m sure. My name is 
Mary Ann Carthington. And real- 
ly, if in any way I’m — ” 

“I told you it’s all right. Gygyo 
and I don’t mean a thing to each 
other. This Temporal Embassy 
work has dulled his taste for the 
everyday female; they’ve either 
got to be atavisms or precur- 
sors. I’m awaiting transformation 
— major transformation —so you 
couldn’t expect very strong feel- 
ings from my side, now could 
you? So let’s just say hello and go 
on from there.” 

"E’LUREET flexed her arm in 
what Mary Ann recognized 
disdainfully as the standard greet- 
ing gesture. Such women! It made 

35 



them look like a man showing 
off his muscle. 

“The ceiling said,” Mary Ann 
began uncertainly, “that Gyg — 
Mr. Rablin isn’t at size at the mo- 
ment. Is that like what we call 
not being at home?” 

“In a sense,” said the bald girl. 
“He’s in this room, but he’s hardly 
large enough to talk to. Gygyo’s 
size right now is — let me think, 
what did he say he was setting it 
for? — oh, yes, 35 microns. He’s in- 
side a drop of water in the field of 
that microscope to your left.” 

Mary Ann swung around and 
considered the spherical black ob- 
ject resting on a table against the 
wall. Outside of the two eyepieces 
set flush with the surface, it had 
little in common with pictures of 
microscopes she had seen in mag- 
azines. 

“In — in there? What’s he doing 
in there?” 

“He’s on a micro-hunt. You 
should know your Gygyo by now. 
An absolutely incurable romantic. 
Who goes on micro-hunts any 
more? And in a culture of intesti- 
nal amebae, of all things. Killing 
the beasties by hand instead of 
by routine psycho- or even chemo- 
therapy appeals to his dashing 
soul. ‘Grow up, Gygyo,’ I said to 
him. ‘These games are for chil- 
dren and for Responsibility Group 
Four children at that.’ Well, that 
hurt his pride and he said he was 
going in with a fifteen-minute 



lock. A fifteen-minute lock! When 
I heard that, I decided to come 
here and watch the battle, just in 
case.” 

“Why? Is a fifteen-minute lock 
dangerous?” Mary Ann asked. 
Her face was tightly set, however; 
she was still thinking of that “you 
should know your Gygyo” re- 
mark. That was another thing 
about this world she didn’t like. 
With all their talk of privacy and 
the sacred rights of the individual, 
men like Gygyo didn’t think twice 
of telling the most intimate mat- 
ters about people to — to other 
people. 

“Figure it out for yourself. 
Gygyo’s set himself for 35 mi- 
crons. That’s about twice the size 
of most of the intestinal parasites 
he’ll have to fight — amebae like 
Endolimax nana, Iodamoeba 
butschlii and Dientamoeba tra- 
gilis. But suppose he runs into a 
crowd of Endamoeba colii, to say 
nothing of our tropical dysentery 
friend, Endamoeba hystolytica — 
what then?” 

“What then?” the blonde girl 
echoed. She had not the slightest 
idea. One did not face problems 
like this in San Francisco. 

“Trouble, that’s what. Serious 
trouble. The colii might be as 
large as he is, and hystolyticae 
run even bigger — 36, 37 microns, 
sometimes more. Now the most 
important factor on a micro-hunt 
is size, especially if you’re fool

enough to limit your arsenal to a 
conventional sword and won’t be 
seen carrying an automatic weap- 
on even as insurance. Well, under 
those circumstances, if you lock 
yourself down to smallness so 
that you can’t get out and nobody 
can take you out for a full fifteen 
minutes, you’re just asking for 
trouble. And trouble is exactly 
what our boy is having!” 

“He is? I mean is it bad?” 

' I ’HE other girl gestured at the 
microscope. “Have a look. I’ve 
adjusted my retina to the magnifi- 
cation, but you people aren’t up 
to that yet, I believe. You need 
mechanical aids for every little 
thing. Go ahead, have a look. 
That’s Dientamoeba fragilis he’s 
fighting now. Small, but fast. And 
very, very vicious.” 

Mary Ann hurried to the spher- 
ical microscope and stared in- 
tently through the eyepieces. 

There, in the very center of the 
field, was Gygyo. A transparent 
bubble helmet covered his head 
and he was wearing some sort of 
thick but flexible one-piece gar- 
ment over the rest of his body. 
About a dozen amebae, the appar- 
ent size of dogs, swarmed about, 
reaching for him with blunt, 
glassy pseudopods. He hacked 
away at them with a great two- 
handed sword in tremendous 
sweeps that cut in two the most 
venturesome and persistent of the 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



creatures. But Mary Ann could 
see from his frantic breathing that 
he was getting tired. Every once 
in a while, he glanced rapidly 
over his left shoulder as if keep- 
ing watch on something in the dis- 
tance. 

“Where does he get air from?” 
she asked. 

“The suit always contains 
enough oxygen for the duration 
of the lock,” Flureet’s voice ex- 
plained behind her, sounding 
somewhat surprised at the ques- 
tion. “He has about five minutes 
to go, and I think he’ll make it. 
He’ll probably be shaken up 
enough, though, to — Did you see 
that?” 

Mary Ann gasped. An elon- 
gated, spindle-shaped creature 
which ended in a thrashing whip- 
like streak had just darted across 
the field, well over Gygyo’s head. 
It was half again his size. He had 
gone into a crouch as it passed 
and the amebae surrounding him 
had also leaped away. They were 
back at the attack in a moment, 
however, once the danger had 
passed. Very wearily now, he con- 
tinued to chop at them. 

“What was it?” 

“A trypanosome. It went by too 
fast for me to identify it, but it 
looked like either Trypanosoma 
gambiense or rhodesiense — the 
African sleeping sickness proto- 
zoans. No, it was a bit too big to 
be either of them, now that I re- 

37 



member. It could have been — Oh, 
the fool!” 

Mary Ann turned to her, genu- 
inely frightened. “What did he 
do?” 

“He neglected to get a pure cul- 
ture, that’s what. Taking on sev- 
eral different kinds of intestinal 
amebae is wild enough, but if 
there are trypanosomes in there 
with him, then there might be 
anything! And him down to 35 
microns!” 

"D EMEMBERING the worried 
glances that Gygyo had 
thrown over his shoulder, Mary 
Ann swung back to the micro- 
scope. The man was still fighting 
desperately, but the strokes of the 
sword came much more slowly. 
Suddenly another ameba, differ- 
ent from those attacking Gygyo, 
swam into the field. It was almost 
transparent and about half his 
size. 

“That’s a new one,” she told 
Flureet. “Is it dangerous?” 

‘No, Iodamoeba butschlii is just 
a sluggish, friendly lump. But 
what in the world is Gygyo afraid 
of to his left? He keeps turning 
his head as if — Oh.” 

The last exclamation came out 
almost as a simple comment, so 
completely was it weighted with 
despair. An oval monster — its 
length three times and its width 
fully twice Gygyo’s height — shot 
into the field from the left bound- 

38 



ary as if making a stage entrance 
in reply to her question. The tiny 
hairlike appendages with which it 
was covered seemed to give it 
fantastic speed. 

Gygyo’s sword slashed at it, but 
it swerved aside and out of the 
field. It was back in a moment, 
coming down like a dive bomber. 
Gygyo and his other attackers 
leaped away, but one of the ame- 
bae was a little too slow. It dis- 
appeared, struggling madly, down 
the funnel-shaped mouth which 
indented the forward end of the 
egg-shaped horror. 

“Balantidium coli,” Flureet ex- 
plained, ‘TOO microns long, 65 
microns wide. Fast and deadly 
and terribly hungry. I was afraid 
he’d hit something like this sooner 
or later. Well, that’s the end of 
our micro-hunting friend. He’ll 
never be able to avoid it long 
enough to get out. And he can’t 
kill a bug that size.” 

“Can’t you do something?” 
Mary Ann pleaded shakily. 

The bald woman brought her 
eyes down from the ceiling at last. 
Making what seemed an intense 
effort, she focused them on the 
girl. They were lit with bright as- 
tonishment. 

“What can I do? He’s locked 
inside that culture for another 
four minutes. Do you expect me 
to go in there and rescue him?” 

“If you can — of course!” 

“But that would be interfering 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



with his sovereign rights as an 
individual! My dear girl, even if 
his wish to destroy himself is un- 
conscious, it is still a wish origi- 
nating in an essential part of his 
personality and must be re- 
spected. The whole thing is cov- 
ered by the Subsidiary Rights 
Covenant of — ” 

“How do you know he wants to 
destroy himself?” Mary Ann 
wept. “I never heard of such a 
thing! He’s supposed to be a — a 
friend of yours! Maybe he just ac- 
cidentally got himself into more 
trouble than he expected and he 
can’t get out. I’m positive that’s 
what happened. Oh — poor Gygyo, 
while we’re standing here talking, 
he’s getting killed!” 

Tp LUREET considered. “You 
may have a legitimate argu- 
ment. He is a romantic and asso- 
ciating with you has given him all 
sorts of swaggering adventure- 
some notions. He’d never have 
done anything as risky as this be- 
fore. But tell me: do you think 
it’s worth taking a chance of in- 
terfering with sovereign individ- 
ual rights, just to save the life of 
an old and dear friend?” 

“I don’t understand you,” Mary 
Ann said helplessly. “Of course! 
Why don’t you let me — just do 
whatever you have to and send 
me in there after him. Please!” 
The other woman rose and 
shook her head. “No, I think I’d 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



be more effective. I must say this 
romanticism is catching. And,” she 
laughed to herself, “just a little in- 
triguing. You people in the twen- 
tieth century led such lives!” 

She turned some switch and 
shrank down swiftly. Just as she 
disappeared, there was a whisper- 
ing movement, like a flame curv- 
ing from a candle, and her body 
seemed to streak toward the mi- 
croscope. 

Gygyo was down on one knee 
now, trying to present as small a 
target to the oval monster as pos- 
sible. The amebae had either all 
fled or been swallowed. He was 
swinging the sword back and forth 
rapidly over his head as the Bal- 
antidium coli swooped down first 
on one side, then on the other, but 
he looked very tired. His lips 
were clenched together, his eyes 
squinting with desperation. 

And then the huge creature 
came straight down, feinted with 
its body, and, as he lunged at it 
with the sword, swerved slightly 
and hit him from the rear. Gygyo 
fell, losing his weapon. 

Hairy appendages churning, 
the monster spun around so that 
its funnel-shaped mouth was in 
front and came streaking back for 
the kill. 

An enormous hand, a hand the 
size of Gygyo’s whole body, swung 
into view and knocked the beast 
to one side. Gygyo scrambled to 
his feet, regained the sword and 

39 



looked up unbelievingly. He ex- 
haled with relief and then smiled. 
Flureet had evidently stopped her 
shrinkage at a size several times 
larger than a hundred microns. 
Her body was not visible in the 
microscope to Mary Ann, but it 
was obviously far too visible to 
the Balantidium coli, which 
turned and scudded away. 

And for the remaining minutes 
of the lock, there was not a crea- 
ture which seemed even vaguely 
inclined to wander into Gygyo’s 
neighborhood. 

To Mary Ann’s astonishment, 
Flureet’s first words to Gygyo 
when they reappeared beside her 
at their full height were an apol- 
ogy: “I’m truly sorry, but your 
fire-eating friend here got me all 
excited about your safety, Gygyo. 
If you want to bring me up on 
charges of violating the Covenant 
and interfering with an individ- 
ual’s carefully prepared plans for 
self-destruction — ” 

S' Y GY O waved her to silence. 

“Forget it. In the words of 
the past: Covenant, Shmovenant. 
You saved my life and, as far as 
I know, I wanted it saved. If I 
started proceedings against you 
for interfering with my uncon- 
scious, in all fairness we’d have to 
subpoena my conscious mind as 
a witness in your defense. The 
case could drag on for months 
and I’m far too busy.” 

40 



“You’re right,” the bald woman 
agreed. “There’s nothing like a 
schizoid lawsuit when it comes to 
complications and verbal quib- 
bling. But all the same, I’m grate- 
ful to you — I didn’t have to go 
and save your life. I don’t know 
quite what got into me.” 

“That’s what got into you.” 
Gygyo gestured at Mary Ann. 
“The century of regimentation, of 
total war, of massive meddling. I 
know: it’s contagious.” 

Mary Ann exploded. “Well, 
really! I never in my life — I just 
can’t believe it! First she doesn’t 
want to save your life, because it 
would be interfering with your 
unconscious — your unconscious! 
Then, when she finally does some- 
thing about it, she apologizes to 
you — she apologizes! And instead 
of thanking her, you talk as if 
you’re excusing her for — for com- 
mitting assault and battery! And 
then you start insulting me 
and — ” 

“I’m sorry,” Gygyo said. “I 
didn’t intend to insult you, Mary 
Ann, neither you nor your cen- 
tury. After all, we must remember 
that it was the first century of 
modern times, the crisis-sickness 
from which recovery began. And 
it was in very many ways a truly 
great and adventuresome period 
in which Man, for the last time, 
dared things which he has never 
since attempted.” 

“Well. In that case.” Mary Ann 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



swallowed and began to feel bet- 
ter. And at that moment, she saw 
Gygyo and Flureet exchange the 
barest hint of a smile. She stopped 
feeling better. Damn these peo- 
ple! Who did they think they 
were? 

Flureet moved to the yellow 
square exit. “I just stopped in to 
say good-by before my transfor- 
mation. Wish me luck, Gygyo.” 
“Your transformation? So soon? 
Well, all the best, of course. It’s 
been good knowing you, Flureet.” 
When the woman had left, 
Mary Ann looked at Gygyo’s 
deeply concerned face and asked 
hesitantly: “What does she mean 
—‘transformation’? And she said 
it was a major transformation. 
What’s she talking about?” 

The dark-haired young man 
studied the wall for a moment. 
“I’d better not,” he said at last, 
mostly to himself. “That’s one of 
the concepts you’d find upsetting, 
like our active food, for instance. 
And speaking of food, I’m hungry. 
Hungry, do you hear? Hungry!” 

A SECTION of the wall shook 
violently as his voice rose. It 
protruded an arm of itself at him. 
A tray was balanced on the end of 
the arm. Still standing, Gygyo be- 
gan to eat from the tray. 

He didn’t offer Mary Ann any, 
which, as far as she was con- 
cerned, was just as well. She had 
seen at a glance that it was the 



purple spaghettilike stuff of which 
he was so terribly fond. 

Maybe it tasted good. Maybe 
it didn’t. She’d never know. She 
only knew that she could never 
bring herself to eat anything 
which writhed up toward one’s 
mouth and wriggled about cozily 
once it was inside. 

That was another thing about 
this world. The things these peo- 
ple ate! 

Gygyo glanced up and saw her 
face. “I wish you’d try it just once, 
Mary Ann,” he said wistfully. “It 
would add a whole new dimension 
to food for you. In addition to 
flavor, texture and aroma, you’d 
experience motility. Think of it: 
food not just lying there limp and 
lifeless in your mouth, but food 
expressing eloquently its desire to 
be eaten. Even your friend Win- 
throp, culinary esthete that he is, 
admitted to me the other day that 
Centaurian libal has it all over his 
favorite food symphonies in many 
ways. You see, they can adjust 
their flavor to the dietary wishes 
of the person consuming them. 
That way, you get—” 

“Please! It makes me absolutely 
and completely sick even to think 
of it.” 

“All right.” He finished eating, 
nodded at the wall, which with- 
drew the arm and sucked the tray 
back into itself. “I give up. All I 
wanted was to have you sample 
the stuff before you left.”

“Leaving — that’s what I came 
to see you about. We’re having 
trouble.” 

“I was hoping you’d come to 
see me for myself alone,” he said 
with a disconsolate droop of his 
head. 

She couldn’t tell whether he 
was being funny or serious, so she 
got angry as the easiest way of 
handling the situation. “See here, 
Gygyo Rablin, you are the very 
last man on Earth — past, present 
or future — that I ever want to 
see again. And you know why! 
Any man who — who says things 
to a girl like you s-said to m-me, 
and at s-such a t-time . .” 

Against her will, and to her ex- 
treme annoyance, 'her voice broke. 
Tears tickled their way down her 
face. She set her lips determined- 
ly and tried to shake them away. 

YGYO looked really uncom- 
fortable now. He sat down 
on a corner of the desk, which 
twitched under him more errati- 
cally than ever. 

“I am sorry, Mary Ann. Truly, 
terribly, sincerely sorry. I should 
never have made love to you in 
the first place. Even without our 
substantial temporal and cultural 
differences, I’m certain you know 
as well as I do that we have pre- 
cious little in common. But I 
found you — well, exciting like no 
woman in my own time, or any 
woman that I’ve ever encountered 

42 



in a visit to the future. Bizarre — 
earthy — violently female. I just 
couldn’t resist the attraction. The 
one thing I didn’t anticipate was 
the depressing effect your pecul- 
iar cosmetics would have upon 
me. The actual tactile sensations 
were extremely upsetting.” 

“That’s not what you said. And 
the way you said it! You rubbed 
your finger on my face and lips, 
and you went : ‘Grea-sy! Greasy!’ ” 
Thoroughly in control of herself 
now, she mimicked him viciously. 

Gygyo shrugged. “I said I’m 
sorry and I meant it. But if you 
only knew how that stuff feels to 
a highly educated tactile sense! 
That smeary red lipstick — that 
tinted grit on your cheeks! There’s 
no excuse for me, that I’ll grant, 
but I’m just trying to make you 
understand why I erupted so 
stupidly.” 

“I suppose you think I’d be a 
lot nicer if I shaved my head like 
some of these women — like that 
horrible Flureet!” 

He smiled and shook his head. 
“You couldn’t be like them and 
they couldn’t be like you. There 
are entirely different concepts of 
womanhood and beauty involved. 
In your period, the greatest em- 
phasis is on a kind of physical 
similarity, whereas we place the 
accent on difference, but most 
particularly on emotional differ- 
ence. The more emotions a 
woman can exhibit and the more 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



complex they are, the more strik- 
ing is she considered. That’s the 
point of the shaved heads: to 
show suddenly appearing subtle 
wrinkles that might be missed if 
the area were covered with hair. 
We call Woman’s bald head her 
Frowning Glory.” 

TVTARY ANN’S shoulders 
slumped and she stared 
down at the floor, which started 
to raise a section of itself ques- 
tioningly, but sank down again as 
it realized that nothing was re- 
quired of it. “I don’t understand, 
and I guess I won’t ever under- 
stand. All I know is that I just 
can’t stay in the same world with 
you, Gygyo Rablin — the very 
thought of it makes me feel kind 
of all wrong and sick inside.” 

“I do understand,” he said se- 
riously. “And for whatever com- 
fort it may be — you have the 
same effect on me. I’d never have 
done anything as supremely idi- 
otic as going on a locked micro- 
hunt in an impure culture before 
I met you. But those exciting sto- 
ries of your adventuresome friend 
Edgar Rapp finally crept under 
my skin. I found I had to prove 
myself a man in your terms, Mary 
Ann — in your terms!” 

“Edgar Rapp?” She looked at 
him incredulously. “Adventure- 
some? Exciting? Edgar? The only 
time he ever gets close to sport is 
when he sits on his behind all

night playing poker with the boys 
in the payroll department!” 

Gygyo rose and barged around 
the room aimlessly, shaking his 
head. “The casual, half-contemp- 
tuous way you say it! The con- 
stant psychic risks run, the inevi- 
tably recurring clashes of per- 
sonality — subliminal and overt — 
as hand after hand is played, as 
hour after hour goes by, with not 
two, not three, but as many as 
five, six or even seven different 
and highly aggressive human be- 
ings involved — the bluffs, the 
raises, the outwitting, the fantas- 
tic rugged contest of it! There is 
not a man in my entire world 
who’d be able to stand up to fif- 
teen minutes of such complex 
psychological punishment — yet, 
to you, it’s almost nothing!” 

Her gaze was very soft and ten- 
der as she watched him knock un- 
happily about the room. “And 
that’s why you went into that aw- 
ful microscope, Gygyo? To prove 
that you could be as good a man 
as Edgar is when he’s playing 
poker?” 

“It’s not just the poker. That’s 
hair-raising enough, I grant you. 
It’s so many things. Take this 
used car that he drives you around 
in. Any man who’d drive one of 
those clumsy, unpredictable pow- 
er-plants through the kind of traf- 
fic and the kind of accident statis- 
tics that your world boasts — and 
every day, as a matter of course! 

43 



I knew the micro-hunt was a pa- 
thetic, artificial affair, but it was 
the only thing available that even 
came close!” 

“You don’t have to prove any- 
thing to me, Gygyo.” 

“Maybe I don’t,” he brooded. 
“But I had reached the point 
where I had to prove it to myself. 
Which is quite silly when you 
come to think of it, but that 
doesn’t make it any less real. And 
I proved something, after all. 
That two people with entirely dif- 
ferent standards for male and fe- 
male don’t have a chance, no 
matter how attractive they find 
each other. I can’t live with my 
knowledge of your innate stand- 
ards, and you — well, you certain- 
ly have found mine upsetting. We 
don’t mesh, we don’t resonate, we 
don’t go. As you said before, we 
shouldn’t be in the same world. 
That’s doubly true ever since — 
since we found out how strongly 
we tend to come together.” 

^ HE nodded. “I know. The way 
^ you stopped making love to 
me and — and said — that horrid 
word, the way you kind of shud- 
dered when you wiped your lips— 
Gygyo, it tore me absolutely and 
completely to bits. I knew right 
then I had to get out of your time 
forever. But with Winthrop act- 
ing the way he is — I don’t know 
what to do!” 

“Tell me about it.” He seemed 



to make an effort to pull himself 
together as he sat beside her on 
a section of upraised floor. 

By the time she had finished, 
his recovery was complete. Dis- 
mayed, Mary Ann watched him 
become once more a highly ur- 
bane, extremely intelligent and 
slightly supercilious young man 
of the twenty-fifth century, and 
felt in her very bone marrow her 
own awkwardness increase, her 
garish, none-too-bright primitive- 
ness come thickly to the surface. 

“I can’t do a thing for you,” he 
said. “I wish I could.” 

“Not even,” she asked desper- 
ately, “with the problems you and 
I have? Not even considering how 
terrible it’ll be if I stay here, if I 
don’t leave on time?” 

“Not even considering all that. 
I doubt that I could make it clear 
to you, however much if I tried, 
but I can’t force Winthrop to go, 
I can’t in all conscience give you 
any advice on how to force him, 
and I can’t think of a thing that 
would make him change his mind. 
You see, there’s a whole social 
fabric involved which is far more 
significant than our personal little 
agonies, however important they 
may be to us. In my world, as 
Storku pointed out, one just 
doesn’t do such things. And that, 
my sweet, is that.” 

Mary Ann sat back. She hadn’t 
needed the slightly mocking tone 
of Gygyo’s last words to tell her 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that he was now completely in 
control of himself, that once more 
he was looking upon her as an in- 
triguing but — culturally speaking 
— extremely distant specimen. 

She knew only too well what 
was happening: she’d been on the 
other end of this kind of situation 
once or twice herself. Just two 
months ago, a smooth salesman 
who handled the Nevada territory 
for her company had taken her 
out on a date and almost swept 
her off her feet. Just as she’d 
reached the point where the wine 
in her brain was filled with bub- 
bles of starlight, she’d taken out a 
cigarette and dreamily, helplessly, 
asked him for a light. The sales- 
man had clicked a lighter at her 
in an assured and lordly gesture, 
but the lighter had failed to work. 
He had cursed, clicked it futilely 
a few more times, then had begun 
picking at the mechanism madly 
with his fingernails. 

¥ N THE next few moments, as 
he continued to claw at the 
lighter, it had seemed to Mary 
Ann that the glossy surface of his 
personality developed an enor- 
mous fissure along its entire length 
and all the underlying despera- 
tion that <was essentially him 
leaked out. He was no longer a 
glamorous, successful and warmly 
persuasive young man, but a pa- 
thetically driven creature who 
was overpoweringly uncertain, 



afraid that if one item in his care- 
fully prepared presentation missed 
its place on the schedule, the sale 
would not take place. 

And it didn’t. When he’d looked 
at her again, he saw the cool com- 
prehension in her eyes. His lips 
sagged. And no matter how he 
tried to recapture the situation, 
how cleverly he talked, how many 
oceans of sparkling urgency he 
washed over her, she was his mas- 
ter now. She had seen through his 
magic to the unhooded yellow 
light bulbs which made it work. 

She remembered feeling some- 
what sorry for him as she’d asked 
him to take her home — not sor- 
row for someone with whom she’d 
almost fallen in love, but slight 
sorrow for a handicapped child 
(someone else’s handicapped 
child) who had tried to do some- 
thing utterly beyond his ability. 

Was that what Gygyo was feel- 
ing for her now? With brimming 
anger and despair, Mary Ann felt 
she had to reach him again, reach 
him very personally. She had to 
wipe off that smile of his. 

“Of course,” she said, selecting 
the first weapon that came to 
hand, “it won’t do you any good if 
Winthrop doesn’t go back with 
us.” 

He looked at her questioningly. 
“Me?” 

“Well, if Winthrop doesn’t go 
back, we’ll be stuck here. And if 
we’re stuck here, the people from 



TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



45 



your time who are visiting ours 
will be stuck in the twentieth cen- 
tury. You’re the temporal super- 
visor — you might get fired from 
your job.” 

“My dear little Mary Ann! Get- 
ting fired — what a concept! Next 
you’ll be telling me I’m liable to 
have my ears cropped!” 

To her chagrin, he chuckled all 
over. 

“Don’t you even feel respon- 
sible? Don’t you feel anything?” 

“Well, whatever I feel, it cer- 
tainly isn’t responsibility. The five 
people from this century who vol- 
unteered to make the trip back to 
yours were well-educated, ex- 
tremely alert, highly responsible 
human beings. They knew they 
were running risks.” 

QHE rose agitatedly. “But how 
^ were they to know that Win- 
throp was going to be stubborn? 
And how could we know that?” 

“Even assuming that the possi- 
bility entered nobody’s mind,” he 
pointed out, tugging at her arm 
gently until she sat down beside 
him again, “one has to admit, in 
all reason, that transferring to a 
period five centuries away must 
be accompanied by certain dan- 
gers. Not being able to return is 
one of them. Then one has to fur- 
ther admit that, this being so, one 
or more of the people making the 
transfer recognized this danger 
and — at least unconsciously — 

46 



wished to subject themselves to 
its consequences. If that is at all 
the situation, interference would 
be a major crime, not only against 
Winthrop’s conscious desires, but 
against such people’s unconscious 
motivations as well — and both 
have almost equal weight in the 
ethics of our period. That’s about 
as simple as I can make it, Mary 
Ann. Do you understand now?” 

“A — a little,” she confessed. 
“You mean it’s like Flureet not 
wanting to save you when you 
were almost being killed in that 
micro-hunt, because maybe, un- 
consciously, you wanted to get 
yourself killed?” 

“Right! And believe me, Flu- 
reet wouldn’t have lifted a finger, 
old friend or no old friend, your 
romantic twentieth-century dither 
notwithstanding, if she hadn’t 
been on the verge of major trans- 
formation, with the concurrent 
psychological remove from all 
normal standards and present-day 
human frames of reference.” 

“What is this major transforma- 
tion business?” 

Gygyo shook his head emphati- 
cally. “Don’t ask me that. It’s a 
concept and a practice as pecul- 
iar to our time as — oh, say, tab- 
loid journalism and election-night 
excitement are to yours. What 
you want to appreciate is this 
other thing — the way we protect 
and nurture the individual eccen- 
tric impulse, even if it should be 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



suicidal. Let me put it this way. 
The French Revolution tried to 
sum itself up in the slogan, Li- 
berte, Egalite, Fraternite; the 
American Revolution used the 
phrase, Life, Liberty and the Pur- 
suit of Happiness. 

“We feel that the entire essence 
of our civilization is contained in 
these words: The Utter Sacred- 
ness of the Individual and the In- 
dividual Eccentric Impulse. The 
last part is the most important, 
because without it our society 
would have as much right to in- 
terfere with the individual as 
yours did. A man wouldn’t even 
have the elementary freedom of 
doing away himself without first 
getting the proper papers filled 
out by the proper government 
official. A person who wanted 
to — ” 

TV/T ARY ANN stood up with de- 
-L” termination. “All right! I’m 
not the least little bit interested in 
this nonsense. You won’t help us 
in any way, you don’t care if 
we’re stuck here for the rest of 
our natural lives, and that’s that! 
I might as well go.” 

“In the name of the Covenant, 
girl, what did you expect me to 
tell you? I’m no Oracle Machine. 
I’m just a man.” 

“A man?” she cried scornfully. 
“You call yourself a man? Why, 
a man would — a real man would 
just — Oh, let me get out of here!” 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



The dark-haired young man 
shrugged and rose, too. He called 
for a jumper. When it material- 
ized beside them, he gestured to- 
ward it courteously. Mary Ann 
started for it, paused, then held 
out a hand to him. 

“Gygyo,” she said, “whether we 
stay or leave on time, I’m never 
going to see you again. I’ve made 
up my mind on that. But there’s 
one thing I want you to know.” 

As if realizing what she was go- 
ing to say, he had dropped his 
eyes. His head was bent over the 
hand he had taken. 

Seeing this, Mary Ann felt her 
voice grow gentler and more ten- 
der. “It’s just — just that — oh, 
Gygyo, it’s that you’re the only 
man I’ve ever loved. Ever really, 
truly, absolutely and completely 
loved. I want you to know that, 
Gygyo.” 

He didn’t reply. He was still 
holding her fingers tightly and 
she couldn’t see his eyes. 

“Gygyo,” she said, her voice 
breaking. “You’re feeling the 
same, aren’t — ” 

He looked up. There was an 
expression of puzzlement on his 
face. He pointed to the fingers he 
had been holding. Each nail was 
colored with a bright, recently ap- 
plied lacquer. 

“Why in the world,” he asked, 
“do you limit it to the fingernail? 
Most primitive peoples did it on 
larger parts of the body. One 

47 



would expect that at least you 
would tattoo the whole hand — 
Mary Ann! Did I say anything 
wrong again?” 

Sobbing bitterly, the girl darted 
past him and into the jumper. 

She went back to Mrs. Bracks’ 
room, and, when she had been 
calmed sufficiently, explained why 
Gygyo Rablin, the temporal su- 
pervisor, either could not or would 
not help them with Winthrop’s 
stubbornness. 

■HAVE POLLOCK glared 
around the oval room. “So 
we give up? Is that what it 
comes to? Not one person in all 
this brilliant, gimmicky, gadgety 
future will lift a finger to help us 
get back to our own time and our 
own families — and we can’t help 
ourselves. A brave new world, all 
right. Real achievement. Real 
progress.” 

“I don’t see what call you have 
to shoot your mouth off, young 
man,” Mr. Mead growled from 
where he was sitting at the far 
end of the room. Periodically, his 
necktie curled upward and tried 
to nuzzle against his lips; wearily, 
petulantly, he slapped it down 
again. “At least we tried to do 
something about it. That’s more 
than you can say.” 

“Ollie, old boy, I may not pay 
a whopping income tax, but I’ve 
been trained to use my mind. I’d 
like nothing better than to find 

48 



out what a thoroughly rational 
approach to this problem could 
do for us. One thing I know — it 
can’t possibly come up with less 
than all this hysteria and emo- 
tional hoopla, this executive-type 
strutting have managed to date.” 

“Listen, a difference it makes?” 
Mrs. Brucks held her wrist out 
and pointed to the tiny gold- 
plated watch strapped around it. 
“Only forty-five minutes left be- 
fore six o’clock. So what can we 
do in forty-five minutes? A mir- 
acle maybe we can manufacture 
on short notice? Magic we can 
turn out to order? Go fight City 
Hall. My Sammy I know I won’t 
see again.” 

The thin young man turned on 
her angrily. “I’m not talking of 
magic and miracles. I’m talking of 
logic. Logic and the proper evalu- 
ation of data. These people not 
only have a historical record 
available to them that extends 
back to and includes our own 
time, but they are in regular 
touch with the future — their fu- 
ture. That means there are also 
historical records that extend back 
to and include their time.” 

Mrs. Brucks cheered up per- 
ceptibly. She liked listening to 
education. “So?” 

“Isn’t it obvious? Those five 
people who exchanged with us 
must have known in advance that 
Winthrop was going to be stub- 
born. It stands to reason they 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



wouldn’t want to spend the rest 
of their lives in what is for them 
a pretty raw and uncivilized en- 
vironment — unless they had 
known of a way out. It’s up to us 
to find that way.” 

“Maybe,” Mary Ann Carthing- 
ton suggested, bravely biting the 
end off a sniffle, “maybe the next 
future kept it a secret from them. 
Or maybe all five of them were 
suffering from what they call here 
a bad case of individual eccentric 
impulse.” 

“That’s not how the concept of 
individual eccentric impulse 
works. I don’t want to go into it 
now, but believe me, that’s not 
how it works! And I don’t think 
the Temporal Embassies keep 
this kind of secret from the peo- 
ple in the period to which they’re 
accredited. No, I tell you the solu- 
tion is right here, if we can only 
see it.” 

i \ LIVER T. MEAD had been 
sitting with an intent expres- 
sion on his face, as if he were try- 
ing to locate a fact hidden at the 
other end of a long tunnel of un- 
happiness. He straightened up 
suddenly and said: “Storku men- 
tioned the Temporal Embassy! 
But he didn’t think it was a good 
idea to approach them — they 
were too involved with long-range 
historical problems to be of any 
use to us. But something else he 
said — something else we could 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



resort to. What was it now?” 

They all waited anxiously while 
he thought. Dave Pollock had just 
begun a remark about “high-sur- 
tax memories” when the rotund 
executive smacked his thigh re- 
soundingly. 

“I remember! He said we could 
ask the Oracle Machine! We 
might have some difficulty inter- 
preting the answer, according to 
him, but at this point that’s the 
least of our worries. We’re in a 
desperate emergency and beggars 
can’t be choosers. If we get any 
kind of answer, any kind of an- 
swer at all — ” 

Mary Ann Carthington looked 
away from the little cosmetics 
laboratory she was using to repair 
the shiny damage caused by tears. 
“Now that you bring it up, Mr. 
Mead, the temporal supervisor 
made some such remark to me, 
too. About the Oracle Machine, I 
mean.” 

“He did? Good! That firms it 
up nicely. We may still have a 
chance. Well, then, as to who shall 
do it — I am certain I don’t have 
to draw a diagram when it comes 
to selecting the one of us most 
capable of dealing with a com- 
plex piece of futuristic machin- 
ery.” 

They all stared at Dave Pol- 
lock, who swallowed hard and 
inquired hoarsely, “You mean 
me?” 

“Certainly I mean you!” Mr. 



49 



Mead said. “You’re the long- 
haired scientific expert around 
here.” 

“I’m a teacher, that’s all, a 
high-school science teacher. And 
you know how I feel about hav- 
ing anything to do with the Oracle 
Machine. As far as I’m concerned, 
it’s the one aspect of this civili- 
zation that’s most decadent. Why, 
I’d rather — ” 

“My stomach didn’t turn over 
when I had to go in and have an 
argument with that crazy Mr. 
Winthrop?” Mrs. Brucks broke in. 
“I liked watching one minute a 
pair rompers, the next minute I 
don’t know what, an evening gown 
he starts wearing? And that crazy 
talk — smell this from a Mars, 
taste this from a Venus — you 
think maybe, Mr. Pollock, I en- 
joyed myself? But somebody had 
to do, so I did. All we’re asking 
you is a try. A try you can make.” 

W A ND I can assure you,” Mary 
Ann Carthington put in 
swiftly, “that Gygyo Rablin is ab- 
solutely and completely the last 
person on Earth I would go to for 
a favor. It’s a personal matter and 
I’d rather not discuss it now, if 
you don’t mind, but I would die, 
positively die, rather than go 
through that again. I did it, 
though, because there was the 
teensiest chance it would help us 
all get home again. I don’t think 
we’re asking too much of you. I 



don’t think so one little bit.” 

Mr. Mead nodded. “I agree 
with you, young lady. Storku is a 
man I haven’t seen eye to eye 
with since we’ve arrived and I’ve 
gone out of my way to avoid him, 
but to have to get involved in that 
unholy Shriek Field madness in 
the bargain—” He brooded for a 
while over some indigestible men- 
tal fragment, then, as his cleated 
golf shoes began wriggling about 
lovingly on his feet, shook him- 
self determinedly and went on. 
“It’s time you stopped shooting 
off your mouth, Pollock, and got 
down to plain brass tacks. Ein- 
stein’s theory of relativity isn’t 
going to get us back to good old 
1958 and neither is your Ph.D. or 
M.A. or whatever. What we need 
now is action, action with a capi- 
tal A and no ifs, no ands, no buts.” 
“All right, all right. I’ll do it.” 
“And another thing.” Mr. Mead 
rolled a wicked little thought 
pleasurably to and fro in his mind 
for a moment or two before let- 
ting it out. “You tako the jumper. 
You said yourself we don’t have 
the time to do any walking and 
that’s doubly true right now, when 
we’re right up against the dead- 
line. I don’t want to hear any 
whining and any whimpering 
about the jumper making you 
sick. If Miss Carthington and I 
could take it, so can you.” 

Dave Pollock rallied. “You 
think I won’t? I’ve done most of 



so

my traveling here by jumper. I’m 
not afraid of mechanical progress 
— just so long as -it’s genuine prog- 
ress. Of course I’ll take the 
jumper.” 

He signaled for one with a mi- 
croscopic return of his old swag- 
ger. When it appeared, he walked 
under it with shoulders squared. 
Let them all watch how a ration- 
al, science-minded man goes about 
things. And anyway, using the 
jumper wasn’t nearly as upsetting 
to him as it seemed to be to the 
others. He could take jumpers in 
stride. 

That was infinitely more than 
he could say for the Oracle Ma- 
chine. 

For that reason, he had him- 
self deposited outside the build- 
ing which housed the machine. A 
bit of a walk and he might be 
able to get his thoughts in order. 

The only trouble was, the side- 
walk had other ideas. Silently, ob- 
sequiously, but nonetheless firmly, 
it began to move under his feet as 
he started walking around the 
squat, slightly quivering structure. 
It rippled him ahead at a pace 
somewhat faster than the one he 
set, changing its direction as soon 
as he changed h'is. 

TJOLLOCK looked around at 
the empty, streets and 
shrugged with resignation. The 
sentient, eager-to-serve sidewalks 
didn’t bother him, either. He had 



expected something like that in 
the future, that and the enor- 
mously alert servitor houses, the 
clothes which changed their color 
and cut at the wearer’s caprice — 
all more or less, in one form or 
another, to be anticipated by a 
knowledgable man as human 
progress. 

Even the development in food 
— from the wiggling please-eat-me- 
and-enjoy-me stuff all the way up 
to the more complex culinary 
compositions on which an inter- 
stellarly famous chef might have 
worked for a year or more — was 
logical, if you considered how 
bizarre, to an early American col- 
onist, would be the fantastic, cos- 
mopolitan variety of potables and 
packaged meals in any twentieth- 
century supermarket. 

These things, the impedimenta 
of daily life, all change and mod- 
ify in time. But certain things 
should not. 

When the telegram had arrived 
in Houston, Texas, informing him 
that — of all the people in the 
United States of America — he 
was most similar to one of the 
prospective visitors from 2458 A.D., 
he had gone almost mad with joy. 
The celebrity he suddenly en- 
joyed in the faculty lunchroom 
was unimportant, as were the 
page-one stories in local newspa- 
pers under the heading: lone 
STAR SON GALLOPING FUTURE- 
WARD. 



TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP

First and foremost, it was re- 
prieve-reprieve and another 
chance. Family responsibilities — 
a dying father and a sick younger 
sister — had prevented him from 
getting the advanced academic 
degrees necessary for a university 
teaching position, with all its ac- 
companying prestige, higher in- 
come and opportunities for re- 
search. Then, when they had 
come to an end and he had gone 
back to school, a sudden infatua- 
tion and too-hasty marriage had 
thrown him back onto the same 
treadmill. 

He had just begun to realize — 
despite the undergraduate prom- 
ise he had shown and none-too- 
minute achievement — how thor- 
oughly he was trapped by the 
pleasant residential neighborhood 
and cleanly modern high school 
between which he shuttled daily, 
when the telegram arrived, an- 
nouncing his selection as one of 
the group to be sent five hundred 
years ahead. How it was going to 
help him, what, precisely, he 
would do with the chance, he did 
not know — but it had lifted him 
out of the ruck of anonymity. 
Somehow, someway, it would en- 
able him to become a striking in- 
dividual at last. 

T\AVE POLLOCK had not real- 
ized the extent of his good 
fortune until he met the other 
four in Washington, D. C. He had 



heard, of course, how the finest 
minds in the country had bitterly 
jostled and elbowed each other in 
a frenzied attempt to get into the 
group and find out what was go- 
ing to develop in their specialty 
half a millenium hence. But not 
until he had talked with his pro- 
spective fellow-tourists — an itin- 
erant worker, a Bronx housewife, 
a pompous Midwestern business 
executive, a pretty but very ordi- 
nary San Francisco stenographer 
— did it come to him that he alone 
had any amount of scientific 
training. 

Only he would be capable of 
evaluating the amount of major 
technological advance! He would 
be the only one able to correlate 
all the bewildering mass of minor 
changes into something resem- 
bling coherence! And thus, above 
all, he would be the only one to 
appreciate the essential quality of 
the future, the basic threads that 
would run through it from its un- 
derlying social fabric to its star- 
leaping fringes! 

He, who had wanted to devote 
his life to knowledge-seeking, 
would exist for two weeks, unique 
and intellectually alone, in a five- 
century-long extrapolation of 
every laboratory and library in 
his age! 

At first, it had been like that. 
Everywhere there was glory and 
excitement and discovery. Then 
little disagreeable things began to

creep in. The food, the clothing, 
the houses — well, you either ig- 
nored them or made other ar- 
rangements. These people were 
extremely hospitable and quite in- 
genious: they didn’t at all mind 
providing you with more familiar 
meals when your stomach had re- 
volted a couple of times. The 
women, with their glossy baldness 
and strange attitudes toward re- 
lations between the sexes — well, 
you had a brand-new wife at 
home and didn’t have to get in- 
volved. 

But Shriek Field and Panic 
Stadium — that was another mat- 
ter. Dave Pollock was proud of 
being a thoroughly rational per- 
son. He had been proud of the fu- 
ture, when he first arrived, taking 
it almost as a personal vindication 
that the people in it should be so 
thoroughly, universally rational, 
too. His first acquaintance with 
Shriek Field had almost nause- 
ated him. That the superb intel- 
lects he had come to know should 
willingly transform themselves 
into a frothing, hysterical pack of 
screaming animals and at regular, 
almost medically prescribed inter- 
vals . 

They had explained to him 
elaborately that they could not be 
such superb intellects, so thor- 
oughly rational, unless they peri- 
odically released themselves in 
this fashion. It made sense, but 
still watching them do it was 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



downright horrifying! He knew he 
would never be able to stand the 
sight of it. 

Yet one could make this ac- 
ceptable in some corner of the 
brain. But the chess business? 

CINCE his college days, Dave 
^ Pollock had fancied himself 
as a chess player. He was just 
good enough to be able to tell 
himself that if ever he had time 
to really concentrate on the game, 
he’d be good enough to play in 
tournaments. He’d even sub- 
scribed to a chess magazine and 
followed all the championship 
matches with great attention. He’d 
wondered what chess would be 
like in the future — surely the 
royal game, having survived for 
so many centuries, would survive 
another five? What would it be 
like : a version of three - dimen - 
sional chess, or possibly another, 
even more complex evolution? 

The worst of it was that the 
game was practically identical 
with the one played in the twen- 
tieth century. 

Almost every human being in 
2458 played it; almost every hu- 
man being in 2458 enjoyed it. But 
there were no human champions. 
There were no human opponents. 

There were only the chess ma- 
chines. And they could beat any- 
body. 

“What’s the sense,” he had com- 
plained, “of playing with a ma- 

53 



chine which has millions of ‘best 
moves and counter-moves’ built 
into its memory circuits? That 
has a selector mechanism able to 
examine and choose from every 
chess game ever recorded? A ma- 
chine which has been designed 
never to be beaten? What’s the 
sense — where’s the excitement?” 

“We don’t play to win,” he had 
been told wonderingly. “We play 
to play. It’s the same with all our 
games: aggressions are gotten rid 
of in a Shriek or a Panic; games 
are just for mental or physical 
exercise. And so, when we play, 
we want to play against the best. 
Besides, every now and then, an 
outstandingly good player, once 
or twice in his lifetime, is able to 
hold the machine to a draw. Now 
that is an achievement. That mer- 
its excitement.” 

You had to love chess as much 
as he did, Dave Pollock supposed, 
to realize what an obscenity the 
existence of these machines made 
of it. Even the other three in his 
group, who had become much 
more restive than he at twenty- 
fifth-century mechanisms and 
mores, only stared at him blankly 
when he raged over it. No, if you 
didn’t love something, you weren’t 
bothered overmuch when it was 
degraded. But surely they could 
see the abdication of human intel- 
lect, of human reason, that the 
chess machines implied? 

Of course, that was nothing 

54 




compared to the way human rea- 
son had abdicated before the 
Oracle Machine. That was the 
last straw to a rational person. 

The Oracle Machine. He 
glanced at his watch. Only twen- 
ty-five minutes left. Better hurry. 
He took one last self-encouraging 
breath and climbed the coopera- 
tive steps of the building. 

“My name is Stilia,” a bald- 
headed, rather pleasant - faced 
young woman said as she came 
toward him in the spacious ante- 
room. “I’m the attendant of the 
machine for today. Can I help 
you?” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“I suppose so.” He looked un- 
comfortably at a distant, throb- 
bing wall. Behind the yellow 
square on that wall, he knew, was 
the inner brain of the Oracle Ma- 
chine. How he’d love to kick a 
hole in that brain! 

T NSTEAD, he sat down on an 
■*- upraised hummock of floor 
and wiped his perspiring hands 
carefully. He told her about the 
approaching deadline, about Win- 
throp’s stubbornness, about the 
decision to consult the Oracle 
Machine. 

“Oh, Winthrop — yes! He’s that 



delightful old man. I met him at 
a dream dispensary a week ago. 
What wonderful awareness he 
has! Such a total immersion in 
our culture! We’re very proud of 
Winthrop. We’d like to help him 
every way we possibly can.” 

“If you don’t mind,” Dave Pol- 
lock said morosely, “we’re the 
ones who need help. We’ve got 
to get back.” 

Stilia laughed. “Of course. We’d 
like to help everybody. But Win- 
throp is — special. He’s trying 
hardest. Now if you’ll just wait 
here, I’ll go in and put your prob- 
lem before the Oracle Machine.”

She flexed her right arm at him 
and walked toward the yellow 
square. Pollock watched it expand 
in front of her, then, as she went 
through the opening it made, con- 
tract behind her. In a few min- 
utes, she returned. 

“I’ll tell you when to go in, Mr. 
Pollock. The machine is working 
on your problem. The answer you 
get will be the very best that can 
be made, given the facts avail- 
able.” 

“Thanks.” He mused for a 
while. “Tell me something. Doesn’t 
it seem to take something vital 
out of life — out of your thinking 
life — to know that you can take 
absolutely any problem— personal 
problem, scientific problem or 
work problem— to the Oracle Ma- 
chine and it will solve it' much 
better than you could?” 

Stilia looked puzzled. “Not at 
all. To begin with, problem-solv- 
ing is a very small part of today’s 
thinking life. It would be as logi- 
cal to say that it took something 
vital out of life to make a hole 
with an electric drill instead of a 
hand gouge. In your time, no 
doubt, there are people who feel 
just that way; they have the ob- 
vious privilege of not using elec- 
tric drills. Those who use electric 
drills, however, have their physi- 
cal energy freed for tasks they 
regard as more important. 

“The Oracle Machine is the 
major tool of our culture. It has 

56 



been designed toward just one 
end — computing all the factors of 
a given problem and relating 
them to the totality of pertinent 
data that is in the possession of 
the human race. But even if peo- 
ple consult the Oracle Machine, 
they may not be able to under- 
stand and apply the answer. And 
if they do understand it, they may 
not choose to act on it.” 

I ''HEY may not choose to act 

* on it?” Dave Pollock re- 
peated incredulously. “Does that 
make sense? You said yourself 
the answers are the very best that 
can be made, given the facts 
available.” 

“Human activities don’t neces- 
sarily have to make sense,” she 
explained. “That is the prevailing 
and rather comfortable modern 
view, Mr. Pollock. There is al- 
ways the individual eccentric im- 
pulse.” 

“Yeah, there’s always that,” he 
grumbled. “Resign your private 
personality by running with a 
howling mob at Shriek Field, lose 
all of yourself in an insane crowd 
— but don’t forget your individual 
eccentric impulse. Never, never 
forget your individual eccentric 
impulse!” 

She nodded soberly. “That 
really sums it up, in spite of your 
unmistakable sarcasm. Why do 
you find it so hard to accept? 
Man is both a herd animal and a 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



highly individualistic animal — 
what we call a self-realizable ani- 
mal. The herd instincts must be 
satisfied at whatever cost, and 
have been in the past through 
various forms of ingroup and out- 
group activities. The need to re- 
sign one’s personality and im- 
merse in something larger than 
self has been recognized since ear- 
liest times: Shriek Fields and 
Panic Stadiums everywhere on 
the planet provide for this need 
and expend it harmlessly.” 

“I wouldn’t say it was so harm- 
less from the look of that me- 
chanical rabbit, or whatever it 
was.” 

“I understand that human be- 
ings who took the place of the 
mechanical rabbit in the past 
looked much worse when a herd 
of men was through with them.” 

S HE locked eyes with him. 

“Yes, Mr. Pollock, I think 
you know what I mean. The self- 
realizable instincts, on the other 
hand, must be satisfied, too. Usu- 
ally they can be satisfied in terms 
of one’s daily life and work, as 
the herd instincts can be fulfilled 
by normal group relationships 
and identification with humanity. 
But occasionally the self-realiz- 
able instincts must be expressed 
at abnormal strengths and then 
we have to have a kind of private 
Shriek Field — the concept of in- 
dividual eccentric impulse. The 

TIME WAITS FOR WINTHROP 



two are opposite poles of exactly 
the same thing. All we require is 
that another human being will not 
be actively interfered with.” 

“And so long as that doesn’t 
happen, anything goes!” 

“Exactly. Anything a person 
may want to do out of his own in- 
dividual eccentric impulse is per- 
mitted. Encouraged, actually. It’s 
not only that we believe some of 
humanity’s greatest achievements 
to have come out of individual ec- 
centric impulses, but that we feel 
the greatest glory of our civiliza- 
tion is the homage we pay to such 
intrinsically personal expression.” 
Dave Pollock stared at her with 
reluctant respect. She was bright. 
This was the kind of girl he might 
have married, if he’d gone on to 
his doctorate, instead of Susie. Al- 
though Susie — He wondered if 
he’d ever see Susie again. He was 
astonished at how bitterly home- 
sick he felt. 

“It sounds good,” he admitted. 
“But living with it is another 
thing entirely. I guess I’m too 
much a product of my own cul- 
ture to swallow it all the way. I 
can’t get over how much differ- 
ence there is between our civiliza- 
tions. We talk the same language, 
but we sure as hell don’t think the 
same thoughts.” 

Stilia smiled warmly and sat 
back. “One of the reasons your 
period was invited to exchange 
visitors with us is because it was 

57 



the first in which most speech pat- 
terns became constant and lan- 
guage shifts came to an end. Your 
newly invented recording devices 
were responsible for that. But 
technological progress continued.” 

A hum began in the distant 
wall. Stilia broke off and stood up. 
“The Oracle Machine is ready to 
give you the answer to your prob- 
lem. Just go inside, sit down and 
repeat your question in its sim- 
plest form. I wish you well.” 

I wish me well, too, Dave Pol- 
lock thought as he went through 
the dilated yellow square and into 
the tiny cube of a room. For all of 
Stilia’s explication, he was su- 
premely uncomfortable in this 
world of simply satisfied herd in- 
stincts and individual eccentric 
impulses. He was no misfit, no 
Winthrop — he very much wanted 
out and to return to what was 
familiar. 

Above all, he didn’t want to 
stay any longer in a world where 
almost any question he might 
think of would be answered best 
by the bluish, narrow, throbbing 
walls which surrounded him. 

But — he did have a problem he 
couldn’t solve. And this machine 
could. 

ITE SAT down. “What do we 
do about Winthrop’s stub- 
bornness?” he asked, feeling idi- 
otically like a savage interrogat- 
ing a handful of sacred bones. 

58 



A deep voice, neither mascu- 
line nor feminine in quality, rum- 
bled from the four walls, from the 
ceiling, from the floor: 

“You will go to the time-travel 
bureau in the Temporal Embassy 
at the proper time." 

He waited. 

Nothing more was forthcoming. 
“It won’t do us any good to be 
there,” he pointed out finally. 
“Winthrop is stubborn; he won’t 
go back with us. And unless all 
five of us go back together, none 
of us can go. That’s the way the 
transferring device is set. So what 
I want to know is, how do we 
persuade Winthrop without—” 
Again the enormous voice: 
“You will go to the time-travel 
bureau in the Temporal Embassy 
at the proper time.” 

And that seemed to be that. 
Dave Pollock trudged out and 
told Stilia what had happened. 

“It seems to me,” he com- 
mented a little nastily, “that the 
machine found the problem was 
just a bit too much for it and was 
trying hard to pass the buck to 
the Temporal Embassy.” 

“All the same, I would do what 
it advised. Unless, of course, you 
find another, subtler interpreta- 
tion of the answer.” 

“Or unless my individual eccen- 
tric impulse gets in the way?” 
This time the sarcasm was lost 
on her. She opened her eyes wide. 
“That would be best of all! Ima- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



gine if you should at last learn to 
exercise it!” 

So Dave Pollock went back to 
Mrs. Bracks’ room and, thorough- 
ly exasperated, told the others of 
the ridiculous answer the Oracle 
Machine had given him on the 
problem of Winthrop’s stubborn- 
ness. 

A T a few minutes to six, how- 
ever, all four of them — Mrs. 
Bracks, Oliver T. Mead, Mary 
Ann Carthington, Dave Pollock — 
were in the time-travel bureau of 
the Temporal Embassy, having 
arrived in varying stages of upset 
by way of jumper. They didn’t 
have any particular hopes: -there 
just wasn’t anything else to do. 

At precisely one minute to six, 
a large group of twenty-fifth-cen- 
tury citizens came in to the trans- 
fer room. Among them were 
Gygyo Rablin, the temporal su- 
pervisor; Stilia, the attendant of 
the Oracle Machine; Flureet, 
wearing the drawn look of one 
awaiting major transformation; 
Mr. Storku, returned temporarily 
from the Odor Festival on Venus 
— and many others. They carried 
Winthrop to his proper seat and 
stood back with reverent expres- 
sions on their faces. 

The transfer began. 

W in t fir op was an old man — 
sixty-eight, to be exact. He had, in 
the past two weeks, undergone 
much excitement. He had been on 



micro-hunts, undersea hunts, tele- 
port jaunts to incredibly distant 
planets, excursions numerous and 
fantastic. 

He had had remarkable things 
done to his body, spectacular 
things done to his mind. He had 
pounded in pursuit at Shriek 
Field, scuttled fearfully at Panic 
Stadium. And, above all, he had 
eaten plentifully and repeatedly 
of foods grown in distant stellar 
systems, of dishes prepared by 
completely alien entities, of meals 
whose composition had been to- 
tally unsuspected by his metab- 
olism. He had not grown up with 
these activities, with this food, as 
had the people of the twenty-fifth 
century. 

Winthrop was no longer stub- 
born. Winthrop was dead.

Blaze of 

Glory 

* 

By ROBERT SILVERBERG 

I can't figure it: should 
Murchison be considered a 
hero — even if his motives 
were anything but heroic? 



T HEY list John Murchison 
as one of the great heroes 
of space — a brave man 
and true, who willingly sacrificed 
himself to save his ship. He won 
his immortality on the way back 
from Shaula II. 

One thing’s wrong, though. He 
was brave, but he wasn’t willing. 
He wasn’t the self-sacrificing 



type. I’m inclined to think it was 
murder — or maybe execution — 
by remote control, you might say. 

I guess they pick spaceship 
crews at random, probably by 
yanking a handful of cards from 
the big computer and throwing 
them up at the BuSpace roof. 
The ones that stick get picked. 
At least, that’s the only way a

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



man like Murchison could have 
been sent to Shaula II in the first 
place. 

TVTURCHISON was tall, bull- 
necked, coarse-featured, 
hard-swearing, a spaceman of a 
type that had never existed ex- 
cept in storytapes for the very 
young — the only kind Murchison 
was likely to have studied. He 
was our chief signal officer. 

Somewhere, he had picked up 
an awesome technical compe- 
- tence; he could handle any sort 
of communication device with su- 
pernatural ease. I once saw him 
tinker with a complex little Ca- 
phian artifact that had been bur- 
ied for half a million years and 
have it detecting the 21-centime- 
ter “hydrogen song” within min- 
utes. How he knew the little 
widget was a star-mapping de- 
vice, I will never understand. 

But coupled with Murchison’s 
extraordinary special skill was an 
irascibility, flaring into seemingly 
unmotivated anger at unpredict- 
able times, that made him a 
prime risk on a planet like Shaula 
II. There was something wrong 
with his emotional circuit-break- 
er, you could never tell when 
he’d overload, start fizzing and 
sparking, and blow off a couple 
of megawatts of temper. 

You mast admit this is not the 
ideal sort of man to send to a 
world whose inhabitants are listed 



in the Extraterrestrial Catalogue 
as “wise, somewhat world-weary, 
exceedingly gentle, non-aggressive 
to an extreme degree and thus 
subject to exploitation. The Shau- 
lans must be handled with great 
patience and forbearance, and 
should be given the respect due 
one of the Galaxy’s elder races.” 

I had never been to Shaula II, 
but I had a sharp mental image 
of the Shaulans: melancholy old 
men, pondering the whichness of 
the why, whom the first loud 
shout would drop in their tracks. 
So it caught me by surprise when 
the time came to affix my han- 
cock to the roster of the Felicific 
and I saw o nthe line above mine 
the scribbled words Murchison, 
John F., Chief Signal Officer. 

I signed my name — Loeb, Ern- 
est T., Second Officer — picked up 
my pay voucher and walked 
away somewhat dizzily. I was 
thinking of the time I had seen 
Murchison, John F., giving a 
Denebolan frogman the beating 
of his life, for no particular rea- 
son at all. 

“All the rain here makes me 
sick,” was all Murchison cared to 
say; the frogman lived and Big 
Jawn got an X on his psych re- 
port. 

Now he was shipping out for 
Shaula? Well, maybe so — but my 
faith in the computer that makes 
up spaceship complements was 
seriously shaken. 



BLAZE OF GLORY

O URS was the fourth or fifth 
expedition to Shaula II. The 
planet — second of seven in orbit 
around the brightest star in Scor- 
pio’s tail — was small and scrub- 
by, but of great strategic impor- 
tance as a lookout spot for that 
sector of the Galaxy. The natives 
hadn’t minded our intrusion and 
so a military base had been estab- 
lished there with no preliminary 
haggling whatever. 

The Feliciftc was a standard 
warp-conversion-drive ship hold- 
ing thirty-six men. It had the us- 
ual crew of eight, plus a cargo of 
twenty-eight of Terra’s finest, be- 
ing sent out as replacements for 
the current staff of the base. 

We blasted on 3 July 2530, a 
warmish day, made the conver- 
sion from ion-drive to warp-drive 
as soon as we were clear of the 
Solar System, and popped back 
into normal space three weeks 
later and two hundred light-years 
away. It was a routine trip in all 
respects. 

With the warp-conversion drive, 
a ship is equipped to travel both 
long distances and short. It han- 
dles the long hops via subspace 
warp, and the short ones by good 
old standard ion-drive seat-of- 
the-spacesuit navigating. It’s a 
good setup and the extra mass 
that the double drive requires is 
more than compensated for by 
the saving in time and maneuver- 
ability. 

62 



The warp-drive part of the trip 
was pre-plotted and just about 
pre-traveled for us; no headaches 
there. But when we blurped back 
into the continuum about half a 
light-year from Shaula, the hu- 
man factor entered the situation. 
Meaning Murchison, of course. 

It was his job to check and 
tend the network of telemetering 
systems that acted as the ship’s 
eyes, to make sure the mass-de- 
tectors were operating, to smooth 
the bugs out of the communica- 
tions channels between navigator 
and captain and drive-deck. In 
brief, he was the man who made 
it possible for us to land. 

Every ship carried a spare sig- 
nalman, just in case. In normal 
circumstances, the spare never 
got much work. When the time 
came for the landing, Captain 
Knight buzzed me and told me 
to start lining up the men who 
would take part. Naturally, I sig- 
naled Murchison first — he was 
our chief signal officer. 

His voice was a slow rasping 
drawl. “Yeah?” 

“Second Officer Loeb. Prepare 
for landing, double-fast. Naviga- 
tor Henrich has the chart set up 
for you and he’s waiting for your 
call.” 

There was a pause. Then: “I 
don’t feel like it, Loeb.” 

I shut my eyes, held my breath 
and counted to three by fractions. 
Then I said, “Would you mind re- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



peating that, Mr. Murchison?” 

“Hell, Loeb, I’m fixing some- 
thing. Why do you want to land 
now?” 

“I don’t make up the sched- 
ules,” I said. 

“Then who in blazes does? Tell 
him I’m busy!” 

I turned down my phone’s vol- 
ume. 

“Busy doing what?” 

“Busy doing nothing. Get off 
the line and I’ll call Henrich.” 

I grunted and broke contact. 
He’d just been ragging me. Once 
again, Murchison had been orn- 
ery for the sheer sake of being 
ornery. One of these days, he was 
going to refuse to handle -the 
landing entirely. And that day, I 
told myself, is the day we’ll crate 
him up and shove him through 
the disposal lock. 

Murchison had his skills and 
he applied them — when he felt 
like it. But only if he believed 
that he would profit. He never 
did anything unwillingly, because 
if he couldn’t find it in himself to 
do it willingly, he wouldn’t do it 
at all. It was impossible to make 
him do something. 

Unwisely, we tolerated it. But 
someday he would get a captain 
who didn’t understand him and 
he’d be slapped with a sentence 
of mutiny. For his sake, I hoped 
not. The penalty for mutiny in 
space is the same as it always has 
been — death. 



VV71TH Murchison’s coopera- 
tion gratefully accepted, we 
targeted on Shaula II, which was 
then at perihelion, and orbited in. 
Down in his little cubicle, Mur- 
chison worked like a demon, tak- 
ing charge of the ship’s landing 
system in a tremendous way. He 
was a fantastic signalman when 
he wanted to be. 

Later that day, the spinning 
red ball that was Shaula II hung 
just ahead of us, close enough to 
let us see the three blobs of con- 
tinents and the big, choppy hy- 
drocarbon ocean that licked them 
smooth. 

The Terran base on Continent 
Three beamed us a landing guide. 
Murchison picked it up, fed it 
through the computer bank to 
Navigator Henrichs and we 
homed in for the landing. 

The Terran base consisted of 
a couple of blockhouses, a sprawl- 
ing barracks and a good-sized 
radar parabola, all set in a ring 
out on an almost mathematically 
flat plain. Shaula II was a great 
world for plains; Columbus would 
have had the devil’s time convinc- 
ing people this world was round! 

Murchison guided us to a 
glassy-looking area not far from 
the base and we touched down. 
The Felicific creaked and groaned 
a little as the landing-jacks ab- 
sorbed its weight. Green lights 
went on all over the ship. We 
were free to go outside.

A welcoming committee was on 
hand out there: eight members 
of the base staff, clad in shorts 
and topees. Regulation uniforms 
went by the board on oven-hot 
Shaula II. The eight looked aw- 
fully happy to see us. 

Coming over the flat sandy 
plain from the base were a dozen 
or so others, running, and behind 
them I could see even more. They 
were understandably glad we 
were here. Twenty-eight of them 
had spent a full year on Shaula 
II; they were eligible for their 
parity-program year’s vacation. 

There were some other— things 
— moving toward us. They came 
slowly, with grace and dignity. I 
had expected to be impressed 
with the Shaulans and I was. 

They were erect bipeds about 
four feet tall, with long thin arms 
dangling to their knees. Their 
gray skins were grainy and rough, 
and their dark eyes — they had 
three, arranged triangularly — 
were deep-set and brooding. A 
fleshy sort of cowl or cobra-hood 
curled up from their necks to 
shield their round hairless skulls. 
The aliens were six in number 
and even the youngest-looking of 
them seemed ancient. 

A brown-faced young man 
wearing shorts, topee and tat- 
tooed stars stepped forward and 
said, “I’m General Gloster. I’m in 
charge here.” 

The captain acknowledged his 



greeting. “Knight of the Felicific. 
We have your relief men with 
us.” 

“I sure as hell hope you do,” 
Gloster said. “Be kind of silly to 
come all this way without them.” 

We all laughed a little over 
that. By now, we were ringed in 
by at least fifty Earthmen, prob- 
ably the entire base complement 
— we didn’t rotate the entire base 
staff at once, of course — and the 
six aliens. 

The twenty-eight youngsters 
we had ferried here were looking 
around the place curiously, ap- 
prehensive about this hot, dry, 
flat planet that would be their 
home for the next sidereal year. 

The crew of the Felicific had 
gathered in a little knot near the 
ship. Most of them probably felt 
the way I did — glad we’d be on 
our way home in a couple of 
days. 

Murchison was squinting at the 
six aliens. I wondered what he 
was thinking about. 

'T'HE bunch of us traipsed back 
the half mile or so to the set- 
tlement. Gloster walked with 
Knight and myself, prattling vol- 
ubly about the progress the base 
was making, and the twenty-eight 
newcomers mingled with the 
twenty-eight who were being re- 
lieved. Murchison walked by him- 
self, kicking up puffs of red dust 
and glowering in his usual man-

her. The six aliens accompanied 
us at some distance. 

“We keep building all the time,” 
Gloster explained when we were 
within the compound. “Branch- 
ing out, setting up new equip- 
ment, erecting new quarters, shor- 
ing up the old stuff. That radar 
parabola out there wasn’t up last 
replacement trip.” 

I looked around. “The place 
looks fine, General.” It was strange 
calling a man half my age Gen- 
eral, but the Service sometimes 
works that way. “When do you 
plan to set up your telescope?” 
“Next year, maybe.” He glanced 
out the window at the featureless 
landscape. “We keep building all 
the time. Got to make something 
out of this planet. We’re doing a 
damn fine job — never recognize 
the place in a couple of years.” 
“How about the natives?” the 
captain asked. “You have much 
contact with them?” 

Gloster shrugged. “As much as 
they’ll allow. They’re a proud old 
race — only a handful of them 
left. But what a race they must 
have been once!” 

I found Gloster’s boyish enthu- 
siasm discomforting. “Do you 
think we could meet one of the 
aliens before we go?” I asked. 

“I’ll see about it.” Gloster 
picked up a phone. “McHenry? 
There any natives in the com- 
pound now? Good. Send him up, 
will you?” 

H 



Moments later, one of the 
shorts-clad men appeared, hand 
in hand with an alien. At close 
range, the Shaulan looked almost 
frighteningly old. A maze of wrin- 
kles gullied its noseless face, run- 
ning from the triple eyes down to 
the dots of nostrils to the sagging, 
heavy-lipped mouth. 

“This is Azga,” Gloster said. 
“Azga, meet Captain Knight and 
Second Officer Loeb of the Feli- 
cific.” 

The creature offered a wobbly 
sort of bow and said in a deep, 
resonant, almost human croak, “I 
am very humble indeed in your 
presence, Captain Knight and 
Second Officer Loeb.” 

Azga straightened painfully 
from bowing and the three eyes 
fixed on mine. I felt like squirm- 
ing, but I stared back. It was like 
looking into a mirror that gave 
the wrong reflection. 

Yet there was something calm 
and wise and good about the gro- 
tesque creature, something relax- 
ing and terribly fragile. The 
rough gray skin looked like pre- 
cious leather, and the hood over 
the skull appeared to shield it 
from worry and harm. A faint 
musty odor wandered through 
the room. 

We looked at each other — 
Knight and Gloster and Mc- 
Henry and I — and we remained 
silent. Now that the Shaulan was 
here, what could we say? Wliat 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



new thing could we possibly tell 
the ancient creature? 

I was fumbling for words to ex- 
press my feeling when the sharp 
buzz of the phone cut across the 
uncomfortable silence. 

Gloster nodded curtly to Mc- 
Henry, who answered. The man 
listened for a moment. “Captain 
Knight, it’s for you.” 

Puzzled, Knight took the re- 
ceiver. He held it long enough to 
hear about three sentences and 
turned to me. “Loeb, commandeer 
a landcar from someone in the 
compound and get back to the 
ship. Murchison’s tangling with 
one of the aliens.” 

Y HOTFOOTED down into the 
compound and spotted an en- 
listed man tooling up his landcar. 
I pulled rank and requisitioned 
it, and minutes later I was park- 
ing it outside the Felicific and 
was clambering up the catwalk. 

An excited-looking recruit stood 
at the open airlock. 

“Where’s Murchison?” I asked. 

“Down in the communicator 
cabin, sir. He’s got an alien in 
there with him. There’s gonna be 
trouble.” 

I remembered Denebola and 
Murchison kicking the stuffings 
out of a groaning frogman. I 
groaned a little myself and dashed 
down the companionway. 

The communications cabin was 
Murchison’s inner sanctum, a cu- 

BLAZE OF GLORY 



bicle off the astro deck where he 
worked and kept control over the 
Felicificfs communications net- 
work. 

I yanked open the door and 
saw him at the far end of the 
cabin, holding a massive crescent 
wrench and glaring at a Shaulan 
facing him. The Shaulan had its 
back to me. It looked small and 
squat and helpless. 

Murchison saw me as I en- 
tered. “Get out of here, Loeb. This 
isn’t your affair.” 

“What’s going on here?” I 
snapped. 

“This alien snooping around. 
I’m gonna let him have it with 
the wrench.” 

“I meant no harm,” the alien 
boomed sadly. “Mere philosophi- 
cal interest in your strange ma- 
chines, nothing more. If I have 
offended a folkway of yours, I 
humbly apologize. It is not the 
way of my people to give offense.” 

I walked forward and took a 
position between them, making 
sure I wasn’t within easy reach 
of Murchison’s wrench. He was 
standing there with his nostrils 
spread, his eyes cold and hard, his 
breath pumping noisily. He was 
angry, and an angry Murchison 
was a frightening sight. 

He took two heavy steps to- 
ward me. “I told you to get out. 
This is my cabin, Loeb. And nei- 
ther you nor any aliens got any 
business in it.” 

a 



“Put down that wrench, Mut 
chison. It’s an order.” 

H E LAUGHED contemptu- 
ously. “Signal officers don’t 
have to take orders from anyone 
but the captain if they think the 
safety of the ship is jeopardized. 
And I do. There’s a dangerous 
alien in here.” 

“Be reasonable,” I said. “This 
Shaulan’s not dangerous. He only 
wanted to look around. Just cu- 
rious.” 

The wrench wiggled warningly. 
I wished I had a blaster with me, 
but I hadn’t thought of bringing 
a weapon. The alien faced Mur- 
chison quite calmly, as if confi- 
dent the signalman would never 
strike anything so old and deli- 
cate. 

“You’d better leave,” I said to 
the alien. 

“No!” Murchison roared. He 
shoved me to one side and went 
after the Shaulan. 

The alien stood there, waiting, 
as Murchison came on. I tried to 
drag the big man away, but there 
was no stopping him. 

At least he didn’t use the 
wrench. He let it slip clangingly 
to the floor and slapped the alien 
open-handed across its face. The 
Shaulan backed up a few feet. A 
trickle of bluish fluid worked its 
way along its mouth. 

Murchison raised his hand 
again. “Damned snooper! I’ll teach 

M 



you to poke in my cabin!” He hit 
the alien again. 

This time the Shaulan folded 
up accordionwise and huddled on 
the floor. It focused those three 
deep solid-black eyes on Murchi- 
son reproachfully. 

Murchison looked back. They 
stared at each other for a long 
moment, until it seemed that 
their eyes were linked by an in- 
visible cord. Then Murchison 
looked away. 

“Get out of here,” he muttered. 

The Shaulan rose and departed, 
limping a little, but still intact. 
Those aliens were more solid than 
they seemed. 

“I guess you’re going to put me 
in the brig,” Murchison said to 
me. “Okay. I’ll go quietly.” 

E DIDN’T brig him, because 
” there was nothing to be 
gained by that. He got the silent 
treatment instead. The men at 
the base would have nothing to 
do with him whatsoever because, 
in their year on Shaula, they had 
developed a respect for the aliens 
not far from worship, and any 
map who would actually use 
physical violence — well, he just 
wasn’t worth wasting breath on. 

The men of our crew gave him 
a wide berth, too. He wandered 
among us, a tall, powerful figure 
with anger and loneliness stamped 
on his face, and he said nothing 
to any of us and no one said any- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thing to him. Whenever he saw 
one of the aliens, he went far out 
of his way to avoid a meeting. 

Murchison got another X on 
his psych report, and that second 
X meant he’d never be allowed to 
visit any world inhabited by intel- 
ligent life again. It was a BuSpace 
regulation, one of the many they 
have for the purpose of locking 
the barn door too late. 

Three days went by this way 
on Shaula. On the fourth, we took 
aboard the twenty-eight depart- 
ing men, said good-by to Gloster 
and his staff and the twenty-eight 
we had ferried out to him, and — 
somewhat guiltily— good-by to 
the Shaulans, too. 

The six of them showed up for 
our blastoff, including the some- 
what battered one who had had 
the run-in with Murchison. They 
wished us well, gravely, without 
any sign of bitterness. For the 
hundredth time, I was astonished 
by their patience, their wisdom, 
their understanding. 

I held Azga’s rough hand in 
mine and finally managed to tell 
him what I had been wanting to 
say since our first meeting — how 
much I hoped we’d eventually 
reach the mental equilibrium and 
inner calm of the Shaulans. He 
smiled warmly at me and I said 
good-by again and entered the 
ship. 

We ran the usual pre-blast 
checkups and got ready for de- 



parture'. Communications was 
working well — Murchison had 
none of his usual grumbles and 
complaints — and we were off the 
ground in record time. 

A couple of days of ion-drive, 
three weeks of warp, two more of 
ion-drive deceleration, and we 
would be back on Earth. 

r I ^ HE three weeks passed slow- 
ly, of course; when Earth lies 
ahead of you, time drags. But 
after the interminable grayness of 
warp came the sudden wrenching 
twist and the bright slippery slid- 
ing feeling as our Bohling genera- 
tor threw us back into ordinary 
space. 

I pushed down the communica- 
tor stud near my arm and heard 
the voice of Navigator Henrichs 
saying, “Murchison, give me the 
coordinates, will you?” 

“Hold on,” came Murchison’s 
growl. “You’ll get your coordi- 
nates as soon as I got ’em.” 

There was a pause; then Cap- 
tain Knight said, “Murchison, 
what’s holding up those coordi- 
nates? Where are we, anyway? 
Turn on the visiplates!” 

“Please, Captain.” Murchison’s 
heavy voice was surprisingly po- 
lite. Then he ruined it. “Please be 
good enough to shut up and let a 
man think.” 

“Murchison — ” Knight sput- 
tered, and stopped. We all knew 
one solid fact about our signal- 



BLAZE OF GLORY 



69 



man: he did as he wanted. No 
one ever coerced him into any- 
thing. 

So we waited, spinning end- 
over-end somewhere in the vicin- 
ity of Earth, completely blind be- 
hind our wall of metal. Until 
Murchison chose to feed us some 
data, we had no way of bringing 
the ship down. 

Three more minutes went by. 
Then the private circuit Knight 
used when he wanted to talk to 
me alone lit up, and he 'said, 
“Loeb, go down to Communica- 
tions and see what’s holding Mur- 
chison up. We can’t stay here 
forever.” 

I pocketed a blaster — I hate 
making mistakes more than once 
— and left my cabin. I walked 
to the companionway, turned to 
the left, hit the drophatch and 
found myself outside Murchison’s 
door. 

I knocked. 

“Get away from here, Loeb!” 
Murchison bellowed from within. 

I had forgotten that he had 
rigged a one-way vision circuit 
outside his door. I said, “Let me 
in, Murchison. Let me in or I’ll 
blast out the lock.” 

I heard a heavy sigh and the 
whisper of the lock contracting. 
“Come on in, then.” 

Nervously I pushed the door 
open and poked my head and the 
blaster snout in, half expecting 
Murchison to leap on me from 

70 



above. But he was sitting at an 
equipment-jammed desk, scrib- 
bling notes, which surprised me. 
I stood waiting for him to look 
up. 

And finally he did. I gasped 
when I saw his face: drawn, har- 
ried, pale, tense. I had never seen 
an expression like that on Mur- 
chison’s face before. 

“What’s going on?” I asked. 
“We’re all waiting to get moving 
and 

He turned to face me squarely. 
“You want to know what’s going 
on, Loeb? Well, listen: the ship’s 
blind. None of the equipment is 
reading anything. No telemeter 
pickup, no visual, no nothing. You 
scrape up some coordinates, if 
you can.” 

TSTE HELD a little meeting 
” half an hour later, in the 
ship’s Common Room. Murchison 
was there, and Knight, and my- 
self, and Navigator Henrichs, and 
three representatives of the cargo. 

“How did this happen?” Knight 
demanded. 

Murchison shrugged. “It hap- 
pened while we were in warp.” 

Knight glanced at Henrichs. 
“You ever hear of such a thing 
happening before?” He seemed to 
suspect Murchison of funny busi- 
ness. 

But Henrichs shook his head. 
“No, Chief. And there’s a good 
reason why, too. If this happens 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to a ship, the ship doesn’t get 
back to tell about it.” 

Captain Knight looked gray- 
faced. He asked worriedly, “What 
could have caused this?” 

“No one knows what subspace 
conditions are like,” Henrichs 
said. “It may have been a fluke 
magnetic field, as Murchison sug- 
gests. Or anything at all. The 
question’s not what did it, Cap- 
tain — it’s how do we get back.” 
“Murchison, is there any chance 
you can repair the instruments?” 
“No.” 

“Just like that — flat no? Hell, 
man, we’ve seen you do wonders 
with instruments on the blink be- 
fore.” 

“No,” Murchison repeated stol- 
idly. “I tried. I can’t do a damned 
thing.” 

“That means we’re finished, 
doesn’t it?” asked Carney, one of 
our returnees. His voice was a lit- 
tle wild. “We might just as well 
have stayed on Shaula! At least 
we’d still be alive!” 

“It looks pretty lousy,” Hen- 
richs admitted. The thin-faced 
navigator was frowning blackly. 
“We don’t dare try a blind ap- 
proach. There’s nothing we can 
do. Nothing at all.” 

“There’s one thing,” Murchison 
said. 

All eyes turned to him. 

“What’s that?” Knight asked. 
“Put a man in a spacesuit and 
anchor him to the skin of the 



ship. Have him guide us in by 
voice — he’ll be able to see, even 
if we can’t.” 

“He’d incinerate once we hit 
Earth’s atmosphere,” I said. “We’d 
lose a man and still have to land 
blind.” 

Murchison puckered his thick 
lower lip. “You’ll be able to judge 
the ship’s height by hull tempera- 
ture when you’re that close. Be- 
sides, as soon as the ship’s inside 
the ionosphere, you can use ordi- 
nary radio for the rest of the way 
down. The trick is to get that far.” 

“I think it’s worth a try,” Cap- 
tain Knight said. “I guess we’ll 
have to draw lots. Loeb, get some 
spaghetti from the galley to use 
as straws.” His voice was grim. 

“Never mind,” Murchison said. 

“How’s that again?” 

“I said never mind. Forget 
about drawing straws. I’ll go.” 

“Murchison — ” 

“Skip it!” he barked. “It’s a fail- 
ure in my department, so I’m go- 
ing to go out there. I volunteer, 
get it? If anyone else wants to, 
I’ll wrestle him for it.” He looked 
around at us. No one moved. “I 
don’t hear any takers. I’ll assume 
the job’s mine.” Sweat streamed 
down his face. 

There was a startled silence, 
broken when Carney made the 
lousiest remark I’ve ever heard 
mortal man utter. “You’re trying 
to make it up for hitting that de- 
fenseless Shaulan, eh, Murchison? 



BLAZE OF GLORY 



71 



Now you want to be a hero to 
even things up!” 

But the big man only turned to 
Carney and said quietly, “You’re 
just as blind as the others. You 
don’t know how rotten those de- 
fenseless Shaulans are, any of 
you. Or what they did to us.” He 
spat. “You all make me sick. I’m 
going out there.” 

He turned and walked away — 
out, to get into his spacesuit and 
climb onto the ship’s skin. 

1%/TURCHISON’S explicit in- 
structions, relayed from the 
outside of the ship, allowed Hen- 
richs to bring us in. It was quite a 
feat of teamwork. 

At 50,000 feet above Earth, 
Murchison’s voice suddenly cut 
out. We were able to pick up 
ground-to-ship radio by then and 
we taxied down. Later, they told 
us it seemed like a blazing candle 
riding the ship’s back. A bright, 
clear flame flared for a moment 
when we cleaved the atmosphere. 

And I remember the look on 
Murchison’s face as he left us to 
go out there. It was tense, bitter, 
strained — as if he were being 
compelled to go outside — as if he 
had no choice about volunteering 
for martyrdom. 

I often wonder about that now. 
No one had ever made Murchi- 
son do anything he didn’t want 
to do — until then. 

We think of the Shaulans as 



gentle, meek, defenseless. Murchi- 
son crossed one of them, and he 
died. Gentle, meek, yes — but de- 
fenseless? 

Maybe they sabotaged the ship 
somehow and forced Murchison 
into self-martyrdom because he 
knew he’d been the cause. I don’t 
know. 

It sort of tarnishes his glorious 
halo. 

But sometimes I think Mur- 
chison was right about the Shau- 
lans, after all. In any case, I’ve 
never been back there. And I 
don’t intend to, even if the com- 
puter picks me to go.

OUR MISSILE ARSENAL 
By WILLY LEY 

S INCE ten to twelve weeks 
go by between the writ- 
ing of this column and its 
appearance on the newsstands, I 
am going to make the cautious re- 
mark that the following observa- 
tion may no longer be true by 
then. (But I doubt it.) The obser- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



73 



vation is that most of the things I 
have been reading in the daily 
press about missiles during the 
last few months mostly dealt with 
missiles that don’t yet exist. Or 
which are, at least, very much un- 
finished, if you consider the pro- 
duction contract the finish line. 

There have been a good many 
articles about the Air Force’s 
Project Atlas, aimed at creating a 
ballistic missile with a range of 
5000 miles. There has been just 
as much discussion about the 
Thor missile, which is to have a 
range of between 1000 and 1500 
miles. 

Since this is now considered an 
“intermediate range,” the Thor 
bears the designation IRBM. 
The Atlas is called the ICBM. 

There have been other articles 
about a Navy project to create a 
ballistic missile that can be fired 
from a submarine without the 
need for surfacing. 

If a newspaper reader, duly 
digesting and memorizing all this, 
should arrive at the conclusion 
that we apparently don’t have 
much worth mentioning right 
now, he would, of course, be 
wrong. But he could hardly be 
blamed. 

T OOKING over the photo- 
graphs which accompany this 
article reminded me of Ordnance 
Day on the Aberdeen Proving 
Ground in the Fall of 1956. 



It happened to be one of those 
days when the rain stopped to 
give the drizzle a chance; in fact, 
the weather was such that the 
commanding general said at one 
point that they were “showing all- 
weather equipment, demonstrated 
by all-weather soldiers to an all- 
weather audience.” However, it 
wasn’t really so; it wasn’t “all 
weather”— it was just all kinds of 
rain. Maybe it was because of 
this weather that something very 
significant did not strike me until 
I woke up the next morning. 

In former years, the audience 
left the Proving Ground trying to 
get its ears back in shape because 
of all the gunfire that had been 
going on. 

I remember one such occasion 
when tanks fought a sham battle 
which was just as noisy as a real 
one. Then a flight of jets came 
in at what seemed to be twenty 
feet over the bleachers and heli- 
copters rattled down to evacuate 
the “wounded.” Elsewhere, 90- 
millimeter anti-aircraft guns spit 
smoke balls into the sky, and 
when the “enemy” tanks had fi- 
nally been beaten off and were 
in retreat, a battery of 280-milli- 
meter guns opened fire on them 
to make them stay retreated. 

After Ordnance Day, 1956, ears 
kept ringing not with the thunder 
of guns, but with the roar of 
rockets. I don’t mean to say that 
no gun was fired — a few guns 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and mortars and even machine 
guns went off. 

But what everybody remem- 
bered was the missile arsenal, the 
gigantic Redstone rocket which 
had been brought in and erected, 
the Corporal on its launcher, the 
Nike battery in the distance. 

Everybody remembered the 
five-second salvo of 64 bombard- 
ment rockets which demolished 
something far away. And the 
Dart missile which pursued a 
speeding tank just above the 
ground and smashed through the 
center of a big target on top of it. 
Two enormous Honest John 
rockets roared into the air to drop 
24,000 yards away in some pre- 
sumably desolate “impact area.” 
One of Honest John’s small 
brothers, named Little John, was 
fired. 

It was rockets and missiles, 
missiles and rockets all day long. 

We do have a missile arsenal 
in working order. As a matter of 
fact, we have three, one each for 
the Army, the Navy and the Air 
Force. However, I am not going 
to list them according to the 
Service, but will go by engineer- 
ing features, beginning with the 
liquid-fuel rocket-propelled mis- 
siles. 

'T'HE biggest one in produc- 
tion is the Army’s Redstone, 
which stands nearly 70 feet tall, 
with a body diameter of almost 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



six feet. The Redstone is not 
a two-stage, but rather a two-part 
missile, consisting of a front sec- 
tion which houses warhead and 
guidance, and an afterbody which 
houses the fuel tanks and the 
rocket motor with auxiliary 
equipment such as fuel pumps. 
The end of the front section is in- 
dicated by the little square fins. 

Somewhere along the descend- 
ing leg of the trajectory, the for- 
ward section separates from the 
afterbody and it seems likely that 
the forward section can still make 
some minor trajectory corrections 
after separation. 

The fuels of the Redstone are 
liquid oxygen and ethyl alcohol, 
and almost everything that hasn’t 
been mentioned yet is classified 
information. The range is non- 
committally stated to be 200-plus 
miles, the takeoff weight is clas- 
sified (but said to be about 
40,000 lbs.) and the weight of 
the payload is a secret. It must 
be enormous, for the 200-mile 
V-2 carried a warhead weighing 
one metric ton and the Redstone 
is so much bigger. 

The next in size among the 
liquid-fuel rockets is the Army’s 
Corporal, which stands 45 feet 
tall, has a body diameter of 30 
inches and a takeoff weight of 
about 12,000 lbs. The fuels are 
red fuming nitric acid and mono- 
ethyl aniline. Control is by means 
of vanes in the exhaust blast. The 

75 




Fig. 1: The Redstone missile. 



range is only 50 miles, but the 
payload capacity is good enough 
for an atomic warhead and the 
Corporal is said to be extraordi- 
narily accurate. 

Because some dimensions are 
still classified, I am not sure 
which missile is the next in size. 
Going by weight (classified, too), 
chances are that it is the Rascal 
of the U. S. Air Force. So far, 
only one retouched photograph 
has been released, but it is known 
that the Rascal is an air-to- 
ground missile developed by Bell 
Aircraft. Total length of the air- 
plane-shaped missile must be 
about 35 feet. 

A British aviation magazine 
added some more information. 
According to this source, the Ras-

cal missile, fueled by liquid 
oxygen and jet fuel, has a weight 
of about 13,000 lbs. and is car- 
ried up by a bomber, say a B-52. 
It is then released at some dis- 
tance from the target, which may 
be as much as 100 miles. After 
release, the Rascal first climbs 
to 100,000 feet, where jet-pro- 
pelled fighters cannot get at it, 
and then, after navigating itself 
to the target, dives in. The war- 
head can be atomic.

length, with a 15-foot solid-fuel 
booster to get it into the air fast. 
The fuels for the rocket are red 
fuming nitric acid and gasoline; 
its weight (without booster) is 
1500 lbs. 

Nike Ajax is the one which is 
now scattered all over the coun- 
try near large cities. Its opera- 
tional slant range is 18 to 23 
miles and the flying time to maxi- 
mum range 80 to 110 seconds. 
Nike Ajax is a so-called beam 
rider, which means that it follows 
a guiding beam to the target. 

Nike-Hercules is the big 
brother to the Nike- Ajax. The 
booster seems to have been put 
together from four Nike boosters. 
The rocket is bigger, too. In fact, 
it is big enough to carry an

atomic warhead, the thought be- 
ing, of course, that an atomic ex- 
plosion in the midst of an enemy 
bombing formation will wipe out 
much more than just one plane. 

The Navy’s Terrier is a ship- 
based anti-aircraft missile with an 
overall length of nearly 27 feet. 
Unlike the Nike Ajax, the Ter- 
rier is a solid-fuel rocket with a 
solid-fuel booster, but is also a 
beam rider. The maximum oper- 
ational slant range is said to be 
20 miles. 

Going on with solid fuels, a 
non-missile must be mentioned 
first— the Army’s Honest John. It 
is not a missile that either can be 
guided or will guide itself after 
takeoff; it is very simply a large 
bombardment rocket.

missile Dart. 




And heavy artillery it is: 27 
feet 3 inches long with a takeoff 
weight of 6000 lbs. and a warhead 
weighing 1500 lbs. The diameter 
of the warhead is 30 inches, the 
diameter of the body 23 inches. 
Its fuel is a single-piece cast solid 
charge. The operational range is 
30,000 yards. 

When fired at a very shallow 
angle (elevation 11 degrees), the 
peak of the trajectory is only 900 
feet above the ground and is 
reached in nine seconds. Impact 
for the firing angle takes place 
after 16.5 seconds at 10,000 
yards. For a 50-degree elevation, 
the peak of the trajectory is 
30,000 feet, attained after 41 sec- 
onds, and impact at 30,000 yards 
after 87 seconds. 

The Air Force’s Sidewinder 



does not show any external 
semblance to the rattlesnake af- 
ter which it has been named and 
its anatomy is not the same, 
either. Still, there are some re- 
semblances. 

The Sidewinder missile is car- 
ried by aircraft as a weapon 
against other aircraft. It is about 
nine feet long and probably 
weighs 150 lbs. In its nose, it 
carries a heat-seeking homing de- 
vice. When fired in the general 
direction of the target, the Side- 
winder senses the heat of the tar- 
get’s engine and steers itself into 
the source of that heat. 

It has been said that if there 
were only one man on an open 
desert at night, a Sidewinder 
would find him. And if he ran 
into his house, slammed the door

and hid under the bed, the Side- 
winder would come in through 
the window and join him. This 
story may have been invented by 
a Texan, but he probably did 
not have to exaggerate much. 

np HE Air Force’s Falcon is 
-*■ another one of these homing 
missiles. It is six feet six inches 
long and weighs about 120 lbs. 
Like the Sidewinder — which is 
also used by the Navy — it is a 
solid-fuel rocket. 

So is the Navy’s Sparrow, an 
eight-foot air-to-air missile with 
a weight of 300 lbs. and a range 
of five to seven miles. The Spar- 
row is not a homing bird, how- 
ever, but a beam rider. 

One Army missile revealed as 
“ready” only a very short time

ago is the Lacrosse, a solid-fuel 
missile with cruciform wings that 
have a wing spread of not quite 
four feet. The operational range 
of the Lacrosse is eight to ten 
miles. 

The last one on the list of 
solid-fuel missiles to be men- 
tioned is the little Dart, which, 
for demonstration purposes, is 
usually fired from an open small 
Army vehicle. (In combat, I 
should think, they’d probably be 
hiding somewhere.) It is a 
destroyer of ground targets, main- 
ly tanks but also pillboxes and, 
possibly, the means of taking a 
support away from a bridge. 

Like the Lacrosse, the Dart has 
cruciform wings. Its guidance is 
by wires, an idea first employed 
by the builders of experimental

naval torpedoes during the so- 
called gay nineties and later de- 
veloped by the Germans during 
World War II. The German de- 
vice which was to use it was the 
air-to-air missile X-4, which has 
acquired some historical fame as 
being the smallest liquid-fuel 
rocket missile ever attempted. 
It flew, but did not get into pro- 
duction. 

On two opposing wings, the 
X-4 carried flares, just to make 
it more visible to the man who 
fired it. On the other two oppos- 
ing wings, the X-4 carried two 
bobbins containing a mile or so 
of thin copper wire which un- 
reeled as the missile progressed. 
The command impulses came to 
the missile through these wires, 
making any “jamming” impos- 
sible. The Dart uses a method 
based on the same idea; detail 
has not been released, of course. 

The next “family” of missiles 
is the one that is characterized by 
having air-breathing engines like 
turbojets and ramjets. They seem 
to be in special favor with the 
Air Force and the largest of them 
is the intercontinental production 
missile, the Snark, of which most 
citizens heard for the first time 
when one flew to Brazil. 

Tlie Snark is an airplane- 
shaped missile — you might just 
as well say a pilotless jet plane 
— with an overall length of 74 
feet and a wing span of 42 feet. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



It is powered by a turbojet en- 
gine and catapulted into the air 
by two solid-fuel takeoff units, 
each of which delivers 33,000 
lbs. of thrust. 

Apparently the testing (or 
training) procedure with the 
Snark is to have it take off from 
Patrick Air Force Base in Florida 
and fly in a straight line down 
the missile range leading over the 
Bahamas and Puerto Rico. After 
2000 miles or so, the Snark 
executes a pretty 180 degree turn 
and it is likely that there is a 
method of landing the missile 
when it comes back. The one that 
got all the publicity simply failed 
to make that turn. 

"jVTEXT one in size is the 

’ Air Force’s Bomarc missile, 
which is 39 feet long, has a wing 
span of 19 feet and a cruising 
speed of two and a half times the 
speed of sound, but a compara- 
tively short range of a few hun- 
dred miles. The Bomarc is pow- 
ered by two 28-inch-diameter 
Marquardt ramjets with 10,000 
lbs. of thrust each. 

While the Snark is to destroy 
ground targets, the Bomarc is an 
anti-aircraft missile, but just how 
it goes about destroying aircraft 
is a matter of conjecture. One 
source guesses that this fighter- 
sized missile carries an atomic 
warhead like the Nike-Hercules. 
Another one says that the Bo- 

81 



marc is a missile-carrier itself, 
going into action with a load of 
Falcon missiles. 

There are no such secrets 
about the next missile, the Air 
Force’s Matador, also a pilotless 
bomber meant to destroy targets 
on the ground. The 46-foot-long 
Matador, with a wing span of 
nearly 29 feet, is powered by a 
turbojet and takes off with the 
aid of one large solid-fuel booster 
rocket. The operational range is 
600 miles. 

The Navy’s equivalent of the 
Matador is the Regulus, of which 
there are now two versions, one 
subsonic, the other supersonic. 

The subsonic Regulus is tur- 
bojet-powered and takes off with 
the aid of two solid-fuel boosters. 
It is 32 V 2 feet long with a wing 
span of 21 feet. It can either be 
command-guided or be equipped 
with homing guidance. The war- 
head is a nuclear warhead, as in 
all large missiles. 

Regulus II, the supersonic 
variety, seems to be just a bigger 
and better Regulus with a more 
powerful jet engine and a longer 
range. 

The range of the first Regulus 
(I very narrowly missed writing 
the regular Regulus) is given as 
around 500 miles. 

Whether the Navy’s Petrel 
should be listed here or not is 
somewhat doubtful — it may still 
be under development and then 

82 



again it may not. At any event, 
the Petrel is a missile which is 
dropped by aircraft for the pur- 
poses of hunting submarines. The 
length is given as 24 feet, the 
wing span as 13 feet, the weight 
as 3800 lbs. and the range as 
five miles. Propulsion is by a 
small turbojet engine. The war- 
head is high-explosive, not atomic. 

The list ends with an air- 
breathing missile which is used, 
in slightly different versions, by 
all three Services, the Talos. It 
is a supersonic anti-aircraft mis- 
sile about ten feet in length, 
powered by an 18-inch-diameter 
ramjet engine. A solid-fuel rocket 
booster gets it going. It is prob- 
ably a beam rider and the opera- 
tional slant range is at least 50 
miles. 

HP HIS completes the list of the 
missile arsenal we have. But 
this beiqg a science fiction maga- 
zine and its readers being what 
they are, I know that I am ex- 
pected to say at least a few words 
about what is being developed 
now. 

Well, the Navy is thinking 
about or working on: 

( 1 ) the Polaris, intermediate 
range solid-fuel fleet mis- 
sile that can be launched 
from submerged subma- 
rines. 

(2) the Triton, a ramjet-pro- 
pelled missile that might be 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



described as a super-Regu- 
lus of 1500 miles range. 

(3) the Lulu, of which it is 
known that its warhead will 
be nuclear and its purpose 
the destruction of sub- 
marines. Everything else is 
either secret or not deter- 
mined. 

(4) the Dove, of which nothing 
has been said. 

As for the Army, it is working 
on: 

(5) the Jupiter, of which it is 
known that it is big. Period. 

(6) the Shrike, of which it is 
known that it is a liquid- 
fuel rocket with a nuclear 
warhead. 

The Air Force has the longest 
list of missiles under develop- 
ment, namely: 

(7) the Atlas, of 5000 miles 
range with hydrogen war- 
head. 

(8) the Titan, of similar range, 
known to use liquid fuels. 

(9) the Thor, of 1500 miles 
range, using liquid fuels. 

(10) the Navaho, of which sev- 
eral versions are under de- 
velopment, ramjet-powered. 

(11) to (??) of which nothing 
has been said. Some of the 
things you read may just 
refer to different Navaho 
versions. Others are prob- 
ably pure research missiles. 
Still others could be anti-

tercontinental missiles. And 
it has been known to hap- 
pen that a “development” 
was mostly the hopeful talk 
of somebody thinking about 
contracts. But it has been 
officially said that the Air 
Force has handed out sev- 
eral study contracts deal- 
ing with an unmanned 
rocket to the Moon. 

B UT what is the X-17 on the 
drawing? The X-17, built by 
Lockheed, is a pure research mis- 
sile. 

The first stage is a liquid-fuel 
rocket which has spinner rockets 
attached near its top that provide 
a rapid rotation for the whole 
soon after takeoff as a stabilizing 
measure. The second stage, a so- 
called “cluster” of solid-fuel 
rockets, then carries the third 
stage out of the atmosphere. The 
third stage is supposed to turn 
over outside the atmosphere 
prior to ignition and then push 
itself vertically down so as to 
enter the atmosphere as fast as 
possible. 

The purpose of the whole thing 
is to find out what happens to a 
missile when it re-enters the at- 
mosphere from space. 

This is something we must 
know — not only for missiles, but 
especially for the day when a 
pilot’s ship “re-enters” from space.

“Uh-uh,” Bradley grunted. “I 
gave this place too good a once- 
over on the way down. It’s un- 
doubtedly a colonial pattern — 
five fairly nice-sized cities clus- 
tered together with a few hamlets 
in between. I’d say that represents 
about two, three hundred years’ 
development from scratch.” 

“Could be other Joes coloniz- 
ing this cluster.” 

“So much like us,” the older 
man asked, “that they even use 
our alphabet?” 

Bradley indicated a man in a 
white uniform pushing a cart 
through the crowd. A placard 
wedged in his hatband read: 

FROZEN SNIBDRIPPLES 

Thoughtfully, the cartographer 
worried the ragged edge of his 
mustache with the back of a fin- 
ger. “We’d better see how much 
communication gear that meteor 
knocked out of the blister.” 

HP HE throng shouted a tumul- 
tuous welcome as Anderson 
paused behind the old man on the 
ramp. “Nobody here to hand us 
the key to the planet?” he asked 
facetiously. 

“Hm-m-m,” Bradley said un- 
easily. “There certainly doesn’t 
seem to be anyone in authority 
out there.” He held up a hand for 
silence. 

The clamor, however, only 



mounted as scores charged up the 
ramp, laughing and jostling one 
another good-naturedly. The 
crowd surged in around them like 
gleeful children. 

A slim man, almost as tall as 
Anderson, seized the pilot’s shoul- 
ders. “Welcome to Dewonto!” 

Grasping the cartographer’s 
arm, a cherubic old woman warm- 
ly cried, “Greetings!” 

But she scowled abruptly and 
tugged at her purse, whirling to 
snag a hand that was fumbling 
with its lid. She pulled on the 
captive arm and drew a tousle- 
haired youngster from the con- 
cealment of the crowd. After 
shaking her finger reprimanding- 
ly in his face, she released him. 

But Anderson started as he 
watched the woman snicker and 
dip her hand deftly into the 
child’s pocket before he could 
lose himself in the throng. 

“Did you see that?” Bradley 
demanded, surprised. 

“The woman and child?” the 
pilot asked. 

“No. Over there. That fellow 
in the blue suit just picked two 
pockets!” 

A small girl with spritelike 
brown eyes pulled insistently on 
Anderson’s jacket. “You from 
Earth, mister?” 

But the pilot caught her hand 
just as it began easing into his 
hip pocket. 

A siren’s groan died off in a

bass sigh as a panel truck pulled 
up at the rear of the crowd. 
Painted on its side was a star 
within a crescent, subscribed by 
three bold letters: “DUO.” 

Anderson was suddenly con- 
scious of stealthy movement in 
the left pocket of his jacket. He 
released the child and spun 
around, trapping an adult hand 
as it withdrew furtively. 

“Thief! Pickpocket!” he heard 
Bradley shout. 

Confounded, Anderson watched 
the cartographer lunge for a 
young blonde. He missed and 
went chasing off down the ramp 
after her. 

“Thief!” shouted the pilot exas- 
peratedly, still holding the lean 
native. “Thieves!” 

He patted his inside breast 
pocket to make sure that the 
Subcon emergency signal genera- 
tor was still there. 

The crowd gave way as two 
uniformed men from the truck 
pushed up the ramp. 

“Break it up!” cried one. 

The other confronted Ander- 
son and the squirming native. 
“What’s coming off here?” 

“I caught him — them — ” An- 
derson glanced around for the lit- 
tle girl —“picking my pockets!” 
Bradley labored back up the 
ramp, dragging the blonde behind 
him. “Her, too!” 

Anderson emptied his pockets 
to see what was missing. But, 



dumbfounded, the pilot spread 
his hand open and stared down 
at a wristwatch, a gold brooch, 
two rings and a half-dozen jew- 
eled pins — none of which had 
been there moments earlier. 

Bradley surveyed a similar 
handful of valuables from his own 
pockets. 

“You’re under arrest,” one of 
the officers announced. 

“But we didn’t steal them!” 
Anderson protested. 

“The charge is not dewontoing.” 

Taking off his uniform blouse 
and cap, the officer thrust them 
into the arms of the native An- 
derson held captive. “Next time, 
be more careful.” 

The other policeman deposited 
his cap on the blonde’s head. 
“Here are the keys. This one’s 
for the truck.” 

Astonished, the two Galac- 
todetic Survey men let the 
summarily commissioned officers 
march them off to the police 
truck. 

HP HE girl, it seemed, was named 
Gladys Jerrel. And as Dew- 
ontoites went — judging by what 
Anderson had seen of the native 
population — she was quite at- 
tractive. The uniform blouse fit 
her clumsily, but its excessive 
proportions only accentuated her 
trim figure. The big cap slouched 
over one side of her forehead, 
crowning billows of soft hair that

seemed to flow from under the 
visor. 

She clamped her hands on her 
hips, confronting the pilot. “For 
the fourth time — you were ar- 
rested because you failed to 
dewonto. Not dewontoing is the 
crime.” 

“The crime?” 

“Of course. From your attitude, 
one would imagine there were 
others.” 

“But 

Bradley, half reclining on a 
richly upholstered couch, poured 
himself another drink and 
grinned. “Don’t get yourself all 
excited, son. I imagine if I was 
your age, I’d settle for a life term 
in this kind of a jail.” Lifting a 
shaggy eyebrow, he surveyed his 
luxuriant surroundings. 

And Anderson, too, gawked at 
broad expanses of gray marble 
walls, at a vaulted ceiling sup- 
ported by ornate columns, at gos- 
samer-clad girls dancing to the 
accompaniment of a flute and two 
stringed instruments. 

He turned back sourly on the 
old man. “It’ll be a life term if we 
don’t get away before Mother 
Ship pulls out of this sector.” 
“Take it easy, Scott boy. Be- 
fore we try anything, let’s find out 
what this place is all about, or we 
might get in deeper.” 

“You don’t look like you’re 
trying to find out anything.” 
Bradley sank lower into the 



cushions. “Let’s say I’m a casual 
observer.” He passed the glass 
slowly under his nose, inhaling 
audibly. “Very casual.” 

Anderson threw up his hands. 
“I should worry. We have Sub- 
con senders. All we have to do 
is press a button and Mama find 
her other twenty-nine map-trac- 
ing scouts will come running.” 
The cartographer straightened 
abruptly. “That’s just what I 
want to avoid — using the Sub- 
continuum SOS to call in the 
others. With Mother Ship here, 
this colony will certainly be re- 
corded and opened up.” 

“That would be bad?” 

“I’m ready to concede there’s 
something — uh — not quite prop- 
er about Dewonto.” Bradley was 
dead serious now. “I have an idea 
that if normal intercourse is set 
up between this planet and the 
rest of the Galaxy, there’ll be 
drastic results.” 

“Don’t get too wrapped up 
in your observations,” the pilot 
warned caustically. “We’ve only 
got six days to get back to the 
mapping party on our own or 
turn on the SOS.” 

Twenty-foot-high doors swung 
open and the other policeman en- 
tered. “Will you see them now, 
sirs?” 

“Who?” Anderson asked. 

“The contractors. They want 
to know if you’ll accept city 
homes or country estates.”

“Later.” The cartographer 
waved him off. “See what I mean, 
Scott boy? We got a lot to learn.” 

Gladys came over. “They’re 
only trying to dewonto,” she ex- 
plained. 

Anderson frowned uncompre- 
hendingly. “What the devil is 
this dewontoing?” 

“Look. I’ll show you.” 

CHE pulled him close and sent 
^ her arms gliding around his 
neck. Her kiss was warm and 
long. 

“See?” she asked, backing off. 

Grinning, the pilot stepped for- 
ward eagerly. “No, but I’m willing 
to learn.” 

He grasped her around the 
waist. But she pushed herself 
away and struck him resounding- 
ly on the cheek. 

The music stopped and the 
dancing girls exited through a 
side door. The other policeman 
reappeared, announcing: “Judge 
Basil will hear your case now.” 

They were led to the court- 
room and seated, with Anderson 
still rubbing his cheek baffledly. 

The judge was small and ro- 
tund, with jowls much like a bull- 
dog’s. His black robe was an aura 
of sobriety. But his disposition 
was altogether out of keeping 
with his stern appearance as he 
shifted eagerly beneath the 
“DUO” escutcheon that hung 
above his chair. 



After smiling indulgently down 
on Anderson and Bradley, he 
glanced at the crier. 

“Oyez! Oyez! Oyez!” intoned 
the latter. “Comes now the case 
of Dewonto versus Defendants 
Scott Anderson and Walter Brad- 
ley, charged with failure to 
dewonto.” 

“Notice the coincidence,” Brad- 
ley whispered to the pilot, “be- 
tween the names of the planet 
and the crime we’re charged with. 
It might mean something.” 

Judge Basil banged his gavel, 
then flinched apologetically. “This 
court finds you innocent of — ” 

The crier leaped up. “Not yet, 
Sid. You got to dress it up a little 
first.” 

“Oh?” The judge relaxed dis- 
appointedly. 

The crier turned to return to 
his desk, but the judge’s hand 
darted out and slipped something 
sparkling into the court official’s 
pocket. 

“Let’s see now,” said the judge, 
concealing a snicker, “you’re 
charged with not dewontoing. 
Moreover, you molested two 
dewontoers. This court finds . .” 

TTIS voice trailed off under the 
disdainful stare of the crier. 

“Oh, dear,” moaned the judge. 
Then, more determinedly, “Darn 
it, fellows, you shouldn’t have 
done that! Ain’t nobody else on 
Dewonto acting up like you two!”

Anderson glanced hopelessly at 
Bradley. “Look, Your Honor, why 
not just let us go back to our 
ship? We’ll — uh — dewonto from 
now on.” 

The judge rapped his gavel. 
“Silence! We can’t let you go 
back.” 

“Why not?” 

Judge Basil folded his hands 
patronizingly. “I’ll put it this 
way: Ain’t no place anywhere as 
good as Dewonto, I don’t sup- 
pose. See what it says right up 
there?” 

He thrust a thumb up toward 
the escutcheon emblazoned with 
the letters “DUO.” 

“If I came here, I’d want some- 
body to see that I stayed,” he 
stated. 

“What does it mean?” the pilot 
asked insistently. 

“Why — why — ” The judge 
looked helplessly at the crier, who 
stepped up to whisper into his 
ear. 

“Why,” Judge Basil declared 
confidently, “it means D-U-O, 
that’s all.” 

“The jobs, Your Honor,” 
prompted the crier. 

“Oh, yes — the jobs.” The judge 
turned back toward the defend- 
ants. “I realize you’d naturally 
like to be placed on sewer main- 
tenance. But everybody can’t get 
the plums — ” 

He stopped abruptly and 
glanced at the crier. “Judicial im-

agreed condescendingly. 

“Then,” the judge continued, 
“until you two are adjusted, I 
am placing you in the custody 
of this policewoman. And I am 
assigning you, Mr. Bradley, to 
the position of Civic Overseer and 
you, Mr. Anderson, as Judge of 
the First and Only Municipal, 
Civic, Criminal and Federal 
Court.” 

The crier smiled approvingly 
as Judge Basil slipped out of his 
robe and handed it over to the 
pilot. 

/“\UTSIDE the All-Courts build- 
ing, Anderson and the car- 
tographer sat idly on the curb. 
Gladys, between them, drew her 
knees up thoughtfully under her 
chin. 

“Look, fellows,” she proposed, 
“why don’t you just go to work? 
Everything’ll come out all right.” 

“You don’t understand,” the 
old man said. “We’re from Galac- 
todetic Survey Headquarters. 
We’re supposed to map new star 
systems. If we come across any- 
thing like Dewonto, we’ve got to 
report it as a lost colony.” 

Anderson grumbled, “I wouldn’t 
worry about reporting this place, 
Walt. Nobody’d believe it any- 
way.” 

“So we’ve got a few official 
questions to ask,” the cartogra- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



pher continued. “And if you’ll 
just tell us where we can find 
somebody in authority — ” 

“Then we can get back to our 
ship,” the pilot finished. 

Gladys smiled affably. “You 
can get back to the ship all right. 
But it won’t do you any good.” 
“Why not?” 

“They’ve emptied it.” 

“What!” Anderson exploded. 
“But of course. After all, you 
had a lot of property there. The 
only thing to do was to take it 
off your hands.” 

The pilot jumped up. “You 
mean they stole everything 
aboard?” 

She shook her head disdain- 
fully. “You have such an odd per- 
spective. They just dewontoed, 
the same as any decent person 
would have.” She motioned across 
the street. “Look.” 

A man lumbered up the side- 
walk, struggling under the weight 
of a familiar object. Anderson 
leaned forward more attentively. 
It was the ship’s pulse-firing con- 
trol console. The Dewontoite 
paused beside a parked automo- 
bile, guiltily glanced up and down 
the street, then deftly pushed the 
console onto the car’s back seat. 
He sprinted away. 

The pilot reached angrily into 
his pocket for the Subcon SOS 
generator. “That settles it!” 
“Wait!” Bradley caught his 
hand and drew him away from 



the girl. “It may be that this 
planet can’t ever enjoy normal 
relations with any other world. 
Their philosophy is obviously dif- 
ferent. Their culture is built on 
some strangely twisted negative 
principles.” 

“What do you expect us to do? 
Let Mother Ship shove off with- 
out us just so nobody’ll disturb 
Dewonto’s cozy little cockeyed 
way of life?” 

“I don’t know. But we’ve still 
got time to trip off the emergen- 
cy signals if we decide that’s the 
right thing to do. In the mean- 
time, let’s observe a little more.” 

A NDERSON hauled the girl to 
her feet. “Take me to the 
mayor or whoever makes the 
wheels spin around here.” 

“That’s easy.” She shrugged, 
extending a hand toward Brad- 
ley in an introductory gesture. 
“His Honor, the Civic Overseer.” 
Groaning, the pilot sank back 
down on the curb. 

A flashy sports model car 
pulled up and the driver leaped 
out. Sheepishly, he dropped the 
keys in Anderson’s hand. “Now 
if you’d rather nothave the su- 
per-deluxe job — ” 

The pilot numbly shook his 
head. 

“You’ll take this one?” The 
driver seemed surprised. Then he 
raced away before Anderson 
could answer.

The pilot turned toward the 
girl. “Gladys, there’s something 
— not quite right about Dewonto, 
you know. Elsewhere, people 
don’t give things away, except on 
special occasions.” 

Her confusion bordered on 
alarm, with her neatly painted 
lips drawn into a little crimson 
circle. “You mean everybody’s a 
taker? But I don’t see — ” 

“Since they don’t have Subcon 
to communicate with the other 
worlds,” the cartographer inter- 
rupted, “it’s obvious that the orig- 
inal colonists planned total iso- 
lation just so they could start this 
kind of society.” 

The pilot nodded back at the 
All-Courts building, at the bronze 
plaque above the main entrance. 
“DUO — what does it mean, 
Gladys?” 

The girl shrugged. 

“Evidently,” Bradley offered, 
withdrawing from deep thought, 
“the symbol remains after its 
literal meaning has been lost.” 
“You got it figured out?” An- 
derson shifted an eyebrow. 

The old man nodded pensive- 
ly. “I think I’m beginning to see. 
Dewonto — not dewon-to, but do 
unto. D-U-O: Do Unto Others. 
The Golden Rule.” 

Anderson straightened. “Do un- 
to others as you would have them 
do unto you!” 

Gladys laughed. 

“That’s cute!” 



T> RADLEY’S finger thoughtful- 
ly traced one of the deep 
creases in his face. “They’ve been 
following it so long that it’s be- 
come a basic way of life — built 
on diligent work, bloated produc- 
tion, mountainous surpluses — 
giveaway on a cosmic scale.” 
“Damn!” Anderson exclaimed. 
“Would we have a good thing 
here!” 

“What do you mean?” the old 
man asked. 

Gladys turned away disin- 
terestedly and went over to 
examine the new-model car. 

“Out of a couple of million peo- 
ple who are one hundred per cent 
givers,” Anderson said, “we’re the 
only hundred per cent receivers.” 
Bradley scratched his chin pen- 
sively. “That might not be such a 
bad idea.” 

“Sure. They’d give us the whole 
planet if we let them.” 

“That’s not quite what I had in 
mind, son. These Dewontoites 
have to be snapped back to nor- 
mal before contact or they’ll be 
the prize suckers of the Galaxy.” 
“And you want to snap them 
out of it by going around preach- 
ing against the Golden Rule?” 
the pilot challenged. 

Bradley shook his head. “That 
wouldn’t work — not in the six 
days we have left to SOS the 
mapping party before it gets out 
of range. If preaching couldn’t 
make other people follow the 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Golden Rule, high-sounding 
phrases won’t make these follow 
the Brass Rule. The only thing 
to do is show them that ' the 
Golden Rule was never meant to 
be a theory of economics and 
just exactly why it shouldn’t be.” 

“You think we can do it?” 

“This system is based on abso- 
lutely literal application of the 
Golden Rule. Sure, it works — 
but only because its basic vul- 
nerability hasn’t been attacked. 
Tearing ours down would mean 
shutting off all purchasing power, 
which just can’t be done. But 
this economic system is wide 
open to attack — all we have to 
do is take everything they can 
provide!” 

Gladys had returned from her 
inspection of the car and had 
stood by studying Bradley as he 
finished outlining his plan. 

“You mean,” she asked in un- 
believing awe, “that you’re going 
to accept everything that’s of- 
fered?” 

“Everything,” Bradley assured 
her, grinning. 

Anderson took the girl’s arm 
and led her toward the car. 
“Gladys, why did you kiss me at 
the jail?” 

She reddened. “Because I — 
guess it was what I wanted you 
to do to me.” 

That figured: do unto others. 
“But you slapped me when I 
kissed you.” 



“Of course. You wanted me to, 
didn’t you? That’s what I would 
have expected you to do if you 
had been in my place. Where are 
we going?” 

The pilot fretted over the il- 
logical kinks. “We’re taking you 
home.” 

The girl’s family, it turned out 
rather astonishingly, were mem- 
bers of the city’s elite, being ex- 
tremely poor-to-do and living in 
one of the most respectably de- 
teriorated downtown districts — 
just across the railroad tracks. 

Gladys paused in front of the 
home and proudly spread her 
arms in a sweeping gesture that 
more than took in the cramped 
breadth of the thirty-foot lot. 
“Don’t jump at conclusions. All 
this impressive non-wealth doesn’t 
mean I’m a spoiled social butter- 
fly.” 

Bradley coughed embarrassed- 
ly. “Forget it, child. I can tell you 
aren’t the kind who’d let poverty 
go to your head.” 

I N CREDULOU SLY, Anderson 
took in the paint-worn frame 
house with its patched roof and 
thin leaning columns and tired 
walls held erect by makeshift 
props. 

“Papa is considering accepting 
a new house from one of the con- 
tractors,” she said, leading them 
up groaning steps. “But we can’t 
do that. Not a family of our 



F MONEY

standing. Don’t you agree?” 

Papa, short and stout and 
amply enveloped in patched 
coveralls, was replastering a hole 
in the living room wall. Under 
the girl’s severe stare, he tried to 
hide the trowel. 

“Honestly, Papa!” Gladys 
stamped her foot. “If it weren’t 
for Mother and me, we’d be living 
in a brick home, with inlaid 
floors!” 

She introduced Anderson and 
the cartographer. 

“From the ship, eh?” her father 
asked, walking cautiously around 
the GS crewmen. He drew a tape 
measure from his pocket and 
stretched it across Anderson’s 
shoulders. “Couldn’t interest you 
in a suit, could I?” 

“Papa’s a tailor,” Gladys ex- 
plained. 

“No,” Anderson said. “I don’t 
think so.” 

But Bradley stepped hastily 
forward. “Yes, you can. He’ll take 
a dozen.” 

Papa Jerrel stiffened in dis- 
belief. “With two pairs of pants 
apiece?” 

“Three. With vests. And I think 
he’d like a half-dozen casual 
jackets and slacks.” 

Apparently this was too much 
for Papa Jerrel. He clasped his 
hands in front of his face. “You 
don’t know what this means — ” 

“I’ll need clothes, too,” the car- 
tographer went on munificently. 



“You’d better measure me up and 
double the order.” 

The girl’s father was beside 
himself with gratitude. “Thank 
you! Thank you, gentlemen . 
Mama!” 

A sedate little lady with a 
moth-ravaged shawl draped over 
her shoulders made a timid en- 
trance. Gladys, perched on an 
arm of the sofa and thereby 
avoiding the springs that pro- 
truded through the cushions, in- 
troduced her. 

“A celebration’s in order, 
Mama!” the tailor cried. “I’ve un- 
loaded! And I don’t have to take 
anything in return! I won’t even 
show a surplus on the books this 
month. Do we have any wine?” 
Bradley winked at the pilot. 
“Looks like we’ve stirred up 
something, son. I think we might 
build an interesting experiment 
around Papa Jerrel. By keeping 
his supply of material depleted, 
we might make him place a posi- 
tive value on his product.” 
Anderson nodded in compre- 
hension. “And his demand for 
raw material might exceed the 
supply.” 

“Right. Then — in Papa Jerrel’s 
line, at least — the old law of 
supply and demand might replace 
this system of ostentatious doing 
without — conspicuous uncon- 
sumption, you might say. But 
time’s short. We’ll have to pass 
this up for bigger things if we’re 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



going to set Dewonto straight.” 
“Of course we have wine,” 
Mama Jerrel told her husband. 
“A cellar full. Remember? Last 
month you let a winemaker dump 
a whole month’s output on us just 
so you could unload two suits.” 
Papa paled momentarily and 
confronted Bradley. “You fellows 
couldn’t use a few cases of wine, 
too, could you?” 

J OINING in the toast that Papa 
had proposed in the name 
of greater austerity, Anderson 
sipped from his glass and set it 
back on the table. Then he pre- 
tended not to see Mama Jerrel 
as she emptied half the contents 
of her glass into his. 

“You see, Mr. Bradley,” the 
tailor said, “conditions are driv- 
ing me to the rich house. The tex- 
tile manufacturers are constantly 
pounding at my door, trying to 
get rid of new bolts of cloth. And 
there’s no legal limit on the 
amount of material they can 
dump on us.” 

“That’s no way to talk,” Gladys 
scolded. “If you were a textile 
manufacturer, you’d expect the 
tailors to take all the bolts you 
could deliver, wouldn’t you?” 

“I suppose so,” he conceded 
grumpily. 

There was an impatient pound- 
ing at the door and Gladys let the 
caller in. He was a lean, bald man 
with a worried expression. 



He smiled, though, when he 
saw the two spacemen. “Thought 
I would find you here. Now about 
that house — ” 

“What house?” Anderson asked 
densely. 

“The one I’d like to — give 
you.” 

“Fine!” Bradley cut in. “When 
can we get it?” 

“You’ll take it?” The man’s 
spirits soared. “I’ll bring you over 
there right away. It’s not very 
desirable, I admit. Four stories, 
thirty-two rooms, acres of grounds 
and fences and tiled streams — * 

“How many others can you let 
us have?” 

The contractor drew back un- 
believingly. “We have twenty-six 
unoccupied and fourteen under 
construction.” 

“We’ll take them all. Tomor- 
row you can send the other con- 
tractors around.” 

Papa turned to his wife. 
“Gladys said they were real 
takers.” 

The contractor was speechless. 

Anderson took him by the arm. 
“Let’s go.” 

“Wait!” Gladys followed them 
out to the car. “I’m going, too. I 
want to see how this comes out. 
Anyway, you’re in my custody, 
remember?” 

TF the rest of the metropolitan 

area suffered from a lack of

Heights more than made up for 
the inadequacy. Here, preten- 
tious mansions reared their im- 
pressive bulks above great ex- 
panses of carefully trimmed 
lawns and meticulously tended 
hedges. 

But they were empty — all ex- 
cept one. 

In that one, dominating the 
tallest elevation, Anderson 
perched on a marble window sill 
and motioned for Gladys to come 
over. In the luxury of the recep- 
tion room, with its gold-trimmed 
furniture and rich tapestries, she 
seemed ill at ease and fretful. 

“Do you suppose,” he asked 
sportively, “that you’ll ever see 
the day when all these homes are 
occupied — with Dewontoites com- 
peting against one another for the 
chance to live in them?” 

She stiffened, appalled. 
“They’re empty because we’d be 
ashamed to accept them. That 
would be not dewontoing.” 

The hypothetical analogies were 
coming easier now. It was as 
though he had asked an inworld 
girl if she thought the elite of her 
planet would ever move out of 
their swanky homes and fight for 
the broken-down tenements. 

Anderson looked reflectively at 
Gladys, only now realizing that 
she was attractive. And he won- 
dered whether he might not have 
been impressed by her looks 
sooner, if it weren’t for the aura 

96 



of abnormality that she shared 
with all the other Dewontoites. 

He tentatively held up a finger. 
“Dewonto, first phase: You leave 
the big houses empty so they’ll be 
avialable for anybody who might 
want them. A sort of pre-arranged 
charitable gesture.” 

She nodded uncertainly. 

“Dewonto, second phase : If you 
people are really interested in 
doing unto others, you’d grab up 
all the mansions you could get. 
By leaving them unoccupied and 
by hogging the simpler residences, 
you’re not dewontoing at all. 
You’re forcing an occasional 
Dewontoite to live in a mansion 
whenever he can’t find anything 
else.” 

Her mouth fell open in abrupt 
realization. 

Anderson smiled, at last able to 
see hope in the situation. Now he 
could agree with Bradley when the 
cartographer insisted they might 
set Dewonto on the right cultural 
path within the next five days. 
By the time they used the Subcon 
SOS generator to call Mother 
Ship, these people would be well 
on the way toward assuming a 
normal role in Galactic civiliza- 
tion. 

r 1 1 HERE was the din of voices 
and the heavy clump of foot- 
steps in the corridor. The door 
burst open, admitting Bradley 
and a horde behind him. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The cartographer waved a news- 
paper. “We did it! They accepted 
the ad!” 

“Front page?” Anderson asked 
above the clamor of excited busi- 
nessmen. 

The old man spread the paper 
open. The display ad, blocked off 
across half the page, read in huge 
letters :

Hobo Heights 

“REAL TAKERS!!!” 
we’ll take as much as 
you’ve got of anything 

YOU WANT TO GIVE 

No tricks! No Unloading! 

You don’t have to accept 
anything in return!!! 

“It wasn’t easy, though,” the 
cartographer complained. “We 
had to take two thousand subscrip- 
tions.” 

“Well, I guess we owed them 
something for printing the ad,” 
Anderson said. 

Bradley turned to the throng 
behind him. “Line forms on the 
right. Are there any furniture 
manufacturers here?” 

Five anxious men and two 
women stepped forward. 

“We’ve taken over all the homes 
in Hobo Heights,” the cartogra- 



pher said. “They need furnishings. 
Can you handle the job?” 

There was a chorus of yesses 
as pencils worked frenziedly on 
order pads. 

“We expect to accept new 
homes at the rate of about thirty 
a day. I’ll want you to furnish 
them, too.” 

“You sure we don’t have to 
take anything in return?” one of 
the furniture men asked suspi- 
ciously. 

“Not a thing. Now do we have 
any heavy industrial equipment 
manufacturers here?” 

Six others came forward eager- 
ly. The cartographer put in orders 
for three thousand tractors, twen- 
ty-two hundred bulldozers, six 
hundred cranes, three hundred 
and fifty steam shovels and a 
thousand pile-drivers. 

In quick succession, he accom- 
modated representatives of cloth- 
ing firms, shoe manufacturers, 
automobile and truck producers 
(twelve thousand cars and sixty- 
four hundred trucks), cosmetics 
concerns, jewelers, food handlers 
and agents for scores of other 
products— until the assembly had 
dwindled to a handful. 

“Think it’ll work?” Anderson 
asked after they had accom- 
panied the last to the door. 

“We’re probably well on the 
way toward cutting into their sur- 
pluses,” Bradley mused. “When 
we corner all the present stocks 



F MONEY 



97 



of commodities, there’ll be one 
hell of a scramble for new goods. 
When that happens, they’ll either 
follow normal supply and de- 
mand or go hungry, naked and 
cold.” 

“I hope so,” Anderson said. 

“It can’t miss,” Bradley assured 
him. 

T>UT somehow Anderson failed 
to share Bradley’s compla- 
cency— particularly the next night 
as he sat in front of the video 
screen watching “Winner Give 
All.” The contestant, a small-craft 
builder, had just won the right 
to unload on the sponsor three 
cabin cruisers, a yacht and eight 
inboard powerboats. Now he was 
going to try for double. 

The pilot again began worrying 
about the likelihood of success in 
their plan to rebuild a cultural 
system in — how much time did 
they have left? — four days. 

He turned toward Gladys, who 
was gazing intently at him. To 
her, he realized, he and Bradley 
must seem like magnificent bene- 
factors. 

“What are you trying to do, 
Scott?” she asked. “There must 
be something behind all this tak- 
ing — some sort of scheme.” 

He filled his pipe and went 
over to the French doors, opened 
them and stepped out on the 
balcony into the brilliant glare 
of Dewonto’s three satellites. 



The blazing match cast a red 
glow on his grave features. “There 
are many other worlds in the 
Galaxy, Gladys. Someday their 
ships will come here regularly 
and this lost colony will be part 
of Galactic civilization.” 

He blew out the match and 
sucked on the stem until the 
glowing bowl illuminated his face 
as much as the flame had. 

“But the rest of the Galaxy,” 
he went on, “is built on different 
principles: ‘The Lord helps those 
who help themselves,’ ‘Charity be- 
gins at home,’ ‘A fool and his 
money are soon parted’.” 

“You mean it’s all selfishness 
and greed out there?” 

“Let’s say we recognize that 
every individual should be re- 
warded for his effort, rather than 
have to pay for the privilege of 
exerting it.” 

“Isn’t the privilege a reward 
in itself?” When he didn’t an- 
swer, she went on, “You want to 
make Dewonto over in the like- 
ness of those other worlds?” 

“It’s something that has to be 
done. We found this world. Even 
if the news of its existence doesn’t 
get back to the rest of the Galaxy 
this time, sooner or later Dewonto 
will be discovered again and will 
have to take its place.” 

She stared incredulously at 
him. “You want us all to be full- 
time takers and — and get what- 
ever we can from one another! 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



You’re just trying to trick us into 
never being able to dewonto 
again! I hate you! And just' when 
I — was beginning to — to start to 
like you!” 

She turned to run off. But he 
grabbed her shoulders. “You’re 
going to tell the others what we 
want to do?” 

“No. That wouldn’t be dewon- 
toing.” She avoided his eyes. 
“You wouldn’t want me to do 
that.” 

He released her and she fled 
back into the house. Then, for 
a long while, he stood leaning on 
the balcony railing, pulling on his 
pipe and looking unseeingly out 
over the countryside. 

His hand crept toward the Sub- 
con pack. All he had to do was 
press a button and, within a few 
hours, Mother Ship would be 
squatting on the lawn below. 

But news of the lost colony 
would spread with subcontinuum 
speed. Within weeks, Dewonto 
would be crawling with millions 
of opportunists — all takers, all 
out to milk the defenseless planet 
dry. 

The disillusionment suffered by 
the natives would be brutal. Their 
whole world would be utterly 
ruined. 

He slipped the emergency 
signal generator back into his 
pocket. Bradley’s plan of showing 
them the way — forcing them to 
work out their own transition — 



was merciful by comparison. It 
had to succeed. 

A NDERSON had a late break- 
fast in his bedroom the next 
morning. On the grounds below, 
men shouted, gears clashed and 
brakes squealed as truck after 
truck rolled across the lawn un- 
loading orders. 

The cranes and bulldozers and 
the army of tractors were lined 
up abreast along the bank of one 
of the streams that sliced across 
the estate. Closer to the mansion, 
conveyor belts had erected three 
mountains of canned goods. 

On two fields across the stream, 
automobiles and trucks were be- 
ing lined up in hundreds of long 
straight rows. The vehicular 
stockpile was already invading 
two adjoining estates. 

Here and there, smaller hills 
of goods were rearing up — crates 
of shoes and boxes of clothes and 
barrels of wine, piles of toys, pens 
filled with livestock, cartons of 
eggs, milk containers. 

Ships and shoes and sealing 
wax, Anderson thought. 

Bradley, already dressed, came 
in as the pilot finished eating. 

“If we expect to leave this 
place at all,” the cartographer 
said soberly, “it’s going to have to 
be by using the Subcon generator. 
I’ve just been over to the ship, 
trying to see if it might be 
possible to get all the pieces to-

gether again. But the parts were 
too well scattered.” 

For once, it was Anderson who 
was confident. “We won’t have to 
depend on the scout craft. We’ve 
got three days left. Before time’s 
up, we’ll have these natives 
eagerly waiting to drive some 
shrewd bargains with Mother 
Ship when she answers our SOS.” 



He took a quick shower, shaved 
and selected a new suit. 

“I’ve been thinking, though,” 
Bradley told him while he 
finished dressing, “that we’re still 
not going about this thing as effi- 
ciently as we could.” 

Anderson paused attentively. 
“Well,” the old man explained, 
“we’ve been whittling away at

“Then run down to that news- 
paper office and place another ad. 
Make it read: ‘Anderson & Brad- 
ley, unlimited manufacturers of 
all products, need raw materials 
— sheet steel, structural beams, 
lumber, textiles’ — all that sort of 
stuff. We’ll take everything they 
got.” 

The pilot turned to leave. 
“Hurry back,” Bradley urged. 
“I have something just as big 
lined up.” 

“What now?” 

“Since I’m Civic Overseer, I’m 
going to start overseeing. Today 
I’ll tour the city on a housing in- 
spection. I’m going to condemn 
substandard dwellings and order 
the residents out.” 

Anderson snapped his fingers. 
“That’s it! We’ll make them move 
into our mansions!” 

“Exactly. And while I’m con- 
demning the shacks, you’re going 
to be charging pretty steep rental 
rates for the homes in Hobo 
Heights. The tenants will have 
to make money to afford a roof 
over their heads.” 

Anderson grabbed his hat. 
“And while you’re in town,” the 
cartographer called after him, 
“drop in at the Chamber of Com- 
merce and arrange to assume 
ownership of all the commercial 
buildings. We’ll either collect rent 
or sell the property back at 
exorbitant prices. In order to 
meet those prices, they’re going to 



the surplus of finished products. 
Manufacturers can still get all 
the supplies they want from the 
raw material producers.” 

Anderson nodded. “I see what 
you mean. With a shortage of raw 
materials, those boys who just 
unloaded on us will have to 
pay the price to get more raw 
materials.”

have to show real gains on their 
other transactions.” 

TN the mansion’s main reception 

room, Anderson squirmed in 
his full-dress jacket. 

“Is this necessary?” he asked 
dismally. 

Bradley slapped him encourag- 
ingly on the back. “We’re demon- 
strating how life should be lived. 
This party won’t have any 
immediate results. But after our 
other lessons sink in, they’ll re- 
member it. They’ll realize this 
sort of thing, too, is part of a 
proper social life.” 

Four orchestras provided the 
music. A corps of maids and 
butlers, stiffly erect in formal 
uniforms, passed trays among the 
guests. 

The only anomalies at the re- 
ception were the guests them- 
selves. The men had come attired 
in work clothes, the women in 
simple house dresses. However, 
other than trying an occasional 
dance, they merely stood around 
uncertainly. 

Perhaps, Anderson ventured, 
they felt a sense of guilt at in- 
dulging themselves in this man- 
ner. Or, more likely, they were 
seriously beginning to question 
their rejection of the finer things. 

The pilot readjusted his white 
tie against the stiff-wing collar 
and, drink in hand, followed the 
cartographer onto the veranda.

Two moons cast their glow on 
ridges and peaks of boxes, crates 
and machines that inundated the 
grounds of the mansion and the 
adjoining four estates. 

Bradley’s face was tired but 
pleased. “We’ve had a good day. 
The groundwork is laid. All that’s 
left to do is let supply and de- 
mand take its normal course. And, 
of course, give things a little prod 
here and there.” 

“When will we find out if we’ve 
succeeded?” 

“Within the next two days, we 
should know whether we can call 
on Mother Ship to pick us up 
without destroying a civilization.” 

“Suppose the test fails? Sup- 
pose we learn these people can’t 
be changed?” 

Bradley’s shoulders lifted. 
“Then we’ll have to decide 
whether we want to see the civi- 
lized Galaxy again so much that 
we’d wreck a world.” 

Gladys, in an extravagant even- 
ing dress which she had worn 
because Anderson “would have 
done the same” for her, stepped 
out onto the veranda and looked 
about anxiously. 

She saw the two spacemen and 
came over. “Why don’t you let 
these people go home? They’ve 
had enough.” 

“Aren’t they enjoying them- 
selves?” the pilot asked lightly. 

“Of course not. They came ex- 
pecting to see the climax of 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



some brand-new dumping trick. 
Naturally they would have re- 
gretted being saddled with goods. 
But it would have been worth it 
because they would have been 
assured that, after all, you are 
Dewontoites at heart.” 

“You mean,” Anderson per- 
sisted, “they’re beginning to sus- 
pect we don’t intend to play their 
way?” 

“They’re beginning to get dis- 
gusted. They want to go home.” 
Anderson reached out solici- 
tously for her hand. 

She drew back. “I’m going to 
tell them the party’s over.” 

The pilot kept his eyes on the 
girl as she returned to the recep- 
tion room — on her bright blonde 
hair that heightened the smooth 
texture, of her back; on the slim 
but strong shoulders, seemingly 
held high in protest over the in- 
trusion upon Dewonto’s calm life; 
on the rhythm of movement that 
set the hem of her dress swirling 
gracefully about her ankles. 

“Easy now, Scott boy.” Bradley 
gripped his arm and laughed. 
“She’s just beginning to hate you, 
remember?” 

"OTAKE up!” Bradley was 
” shouting insistently as 
Anderson opened his eyes and 
lazily rolled over. 

“The population’s started mov- 
ing — they’re leaving the slum 
areas,” the cartographer said, his 



face seemingly older and some- 
what more strained. 

Puzzled, Anderson glanced out 
the window. But there was no 
sign of life around the mansions, 
spotted on the visible hilltops. 

“They must be finding our rent 
too high,” he said, smiling. “That’s 
encouraging. Shows they’re begin- 
ning to recognize values.” 

“Guess again,” Bradley said 
glumly, spreading open a copy 
of the morning paper. 

A four-column picture showed 
a plain south of the city with 
thousands of tents thrown up in 
rows. Anderson frowned uncom- 
prehendingly. 

“We condemned their homes 
and chased them out, all right,” 
said Bradley dispiritedly. “But 
they didn’t start renting our man- 
sions. They just pitched tents 
instead.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

Bradley read from the paper: 
“ ‘The vast majority of Dewon- 
toites of this city’— this is a front- 
page editorial — ‘now face an 
immeasurably more rewarding 
status of frugal existence, thanks 
to the visiting spacemen. In this 
matter, newly appointed Civic 
Overseer Bradley has shown a 
remarkable DUO capacity. For 
only he foresaw that by hav- 
ing their residences condemned 
would our citizens discover an 
even more thorough method of 
domestic self-privation.

“ ‘The foresight of the visitors 
was again demonstrated when 
they assumed ownership of Hobo 
Heights. That made it impossible 
for dispossessed Dewontoites to 
move into these hilltop homes, 
even if they had decided upon 
that as a last resort’.” 

Anderson took the news with a 
sickening sensation and struggled 
out of bed. “What are we going 
to do?” 

“I’m hoping it’s just a tem- 
porary setback. When they bump 
into all the other economic ’up- 
heavals we’ve prepared, they 
might find they don’t have time 
to readjust to tent life. And they 
may change their minds about 
Hobo Heights.” 

Anderson swallowed with diffi- 
culty. “What’s that smell?” Snif- 
fing, he traced the disturbing odor 
to the double doors and ventured 
out on the balcony. 

“Some of those milk cans 
spilled on delivery yesterday,” 
the cartographer said. 

It wasn’t only the souring milk, 
Anderson realized. There were 
thousands of broken egg crates. 
And swarms of insects were like 
low-lying clouds over the hills 
of unpackaged meats and vege- 
tables. He realized now that they 
should have qualified that line in 
the ad about accepting anything. 

The butler appeared at the 
door. “There’s a delegation of 
manufacturers to see you, sirs.” 

104 



A FTER dressing hurriedly, An- 
derson went with Bradley to 
the north drawing room. Showing 
the eager anticipation of children 
with a secret, the delegates 
crowded anxiously around the 
spacemen. 

“We came to express our grati- 
tude,” proclaimed one. 

“Why?” Bradley drew back 
misgivingly. 

“Because we would have con- 
tinued on as finished-product 
manufacturers the rest of our 
lives if you hadn’t cut in on our 
supplies.” 

“And,” added another, “we 
were getting tired of turning out 
finished articles that nobody 
wanted — except to unload on 
somebody else.” 

“So,” continued a third exu- 
berantly, “we all decided to be- 
come producers of raw materials.” 

“And now,” resumed the first, 
“we’ll all be happy. With big 
operators like you handling the 
manufacture of finished products, 
and with all of us supplying the 
raw materials you need, we’ll 
achieve an output that we’ve 
never seen before!” 

Arm in arm and jabbering 
enthusiastically, the delegation 
marched out, leaving a gaping 
pilot and cartographer. 

The butler appeared in the 
doorway in their wake. “The pres- 
ident of the Chamber of Com- 
merce, gentlemen.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The dignitary was a jovial indi- 
vidual who guffawed for no ap- 
parent reason all the way from 
the door to where the two GS 
surveymen stood. 

“Allow me, sirs,” he said, “to 
congratulate you on having won 
the year’s DUO Award.” 

“For what?” the pilot asked 
suspiciously. 

“For making us realize our 
commercial buildings were much 
too pretentious and out of line 
with the general austerity of 
Dewonto. By taking them off our 
hands and pretending to place an 
enormous negative value on the 
stores and offices, you made us 
see the errors of our ways.” 

“You mean,” Bradley asked, 
disheartened, “you’re not going to 
rent from us or buy the buildings 
back?” 

“Cagy, aren’t you, sir?” The 
Chamber of Commerce president 
nudged the old man in the ribs. 
“We’re going to run our businesses 
from our homes — just as you in- 
tended from the first. To think it 
took an outsider to show us the 
way! You, sirs, richly deserve the 
DUO Award.” 

Anderson slumped back against 
the piano. “The award — what is 
it?” 

The visitor looked about the 
room. His eyes fell on an elab- 
orate vase. He put it under his 
arm. “This will do nicely, I 
think. Thank you, gentlemen.” 



Anderson stood numbly rigid, 
aware of only the mounting odor 
from the piles of spoiling food. 

Gladys stepped from behind a 
column, cried out delightedly and 
raced forward to throw her arms 
around the pilot. 

“I knew it!” she cried. “I knew 
all the while it was a trick. You 
just let me believe you were anti- 
DUO so I wouldn’t give you 
away!” 

Outside, a band played a lively 
march and thousands of natives 
jumped up and down, waving 
banners that proudly proclaimed : 
“For They Are Jolly Good 
Dewontoites!” 

T^ISCONSOLATELY, Ander- 
son watched the old space- 
man pace the veranda, his shoul- 
ders sagging and his thin hair 
disheveled and seemingly grayer 
than usual. Dewonto’s giant sun 
slipped below the horizon, drag- 
ging along the almost invisible 
white dwarf that was its com- 
panion. 

“Why don’t we give it up, 
Walt?” the pilot asked, mixing 
the Dewontoite equivalent of a 
scotch and soda. “They just kept 
one step ahead of us with their 
DUO thinking.” 

“But we didn’t lose! We 
couldn’t! It’s only — ” 

“A temporary setback?” The 
pilot laughed sourly, extending a 
drink toward the other.

Bradley took it and gulped. 
“Of course! You’ll see. They’re 
just holding on to their system 
as long as they can. Those re- 
verses we suffered this morning 
were simply the final thrashings.” 

“Sure,” Anderson said skep- 
tically. “One minute they’ll be 
confirmed Dewontoites, the next 
they’ll be unprincipled takers, 
knocking themselves out to earn 
instead of unload.” 

Gladys, again in her oversized 
policewoman’s uniform, stepped 
out of the house into the twilight. 
“How much longer are we going 
to stay here?” She gestured disap- 
provingly at the wealth all around 
her. 

“You don’t have to stick 
around, you know,” Anderson told 
her sullenly. 

“Oh, but I do. You’re still in 
my custody. I know what’s the 
matter — you’re disappointed be- 
cause we saw through your clever 
tricks— embarrassed because we’ve 
found you out as real Dewonto- 
ites at heart.” 

“Aw, go blow your tubes,” he 
said bluntly, his mind grappling 
with more serious issues. 

She reddened indignantly. “All 
right, I will — if that’s what you 
want. All you have to do is re- 
lease me.” 

“Release you?” Anderson 
looked up puzzedly at her. 

“Certainly. The judge of the 
First and Only Municipal, Civic, 

106 



Criminal and Federal Court as- 
signed you to me. You’re the 
judge now. Only you can take me 
off this assignment.” 

Anderson drained his glass and 
held it out shakily toward the 
cartographer for a refill. “By 
virtue of the judicial powers 
vested in me,” he rolled the words 
out with a heavy tongue, “I now 
cancel the custodial assignment 
of one Gladys Jerrel, to wit — ” 
“Oh!” the girl cried, exas- 
perated. She ran down the walk 
toward the main gates of the 
estate. 

“Gladys!” Anderson called, im- 
mediately contrite, starting off 
after her. 

But Bradley caught his arm. 
“Let her go, son. Don’t forget — 
she’ll hate you a lot more if we 
decide to SOS Mother Ship.” 
Anderson dropped down glum- 
ly on the chaise longue. Darkness 
had come and there was only a 
single moon out to illuminate the 
piles of surplus material. 

“Well, what about it?” he asked 
finally. “At noon tomorrow, the 
mapping party jumps into an- 
other sector, out of range of our 
Subcon signalers. We’ll be pre- 
sumed lost.” He withdrew his 
emergency signal generator and 
placed it on the cocktail table. 
“Do we yell ‘uncle’ or not?” 

“If we do,” Bradley said sober- 
ly, “these people are in for one 
hell of a jolt. They’ll practically 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



become voluntary slaves with the 
first wave of visitors. I don’t see 
how they can survive as a 
people.” 

A NDERSON started and 
turned toward the road. 
Voices — thousands of them. Ex- 
cited voices. Perhaps even angry. 

The horde stormed in through 
the gates. They deployed into 
smaller groups and surged toward 
the hoarded products, sweeping 
in over the piles of clothes and 
shoes, enveloping the hills of 
canned foodstuffs, breaking off 
in myriad smaller units to over- 
run the lines of parked automo- 
biles and trucks and bulldozers. 

Then the estate resounded 
with the rattle and rumble of 
heavy industrial machinery as the 
tractors and cranes and steam 
shovels and bulldozers were 
themselves put to work whittling 
down and hauling away the 
stocks of supplies. 

Bradley grasped the pilot’s 
shoulder. “We won, boy! We 
won!” 

But Anderson only stared puz- 
zledly at the chaotic scene of 
plundering. “I don’t understand.” 

“We planted the seeds. The 
results weren’t visible right away, 
but they were cumulative. Now 
the dam has burst. And if they 
decided to loot and plunder to 
get back the surpluses we tricked 
them out of, that means they’re 



ready to drive shrewd bargains 
among themselves for more. Son, 
we’ve cured a culture!” 

In gratified silence, the two 
Galactodetic surveymen watched 
the stockpiles of articles shrink 
as trucks and cars pulled along- 
side, parked momentarily, then 
drove away loaded. 

Bradley broke the seals on two 
more bottles and he and Ander- 
son repeatedly toasted their suc- 
cess. 

Finally the pilot held up his 
Subcon pack. “Think we ought to 
call Mother Ship now?” 

Swaying, the cartographer 
tripped over the chaise longue 
and flailed backward. The pilot 
laughed at the ludicrous sight of 
the elderly man sprawled across 
a flower bed. 

“Don’t think it’d be very 
wise, Scott boy,” Bradley said, 
rising on an elbow and grinning. 
“They’d be here in a couple of 
hours. Wouldn’t want ’em to find 
us in, let’s say, such an elated 
state. Against regulations.” 

“Guess you’re right,” Anderson 
agreed. “Anyway, we still have 
plenty of time.” 

r T , HE night assault on the piles 
of surplus material had been 
no dream, Anderson reassured 
himself the next morning as he 
had an early breakfast with the 
cartographer on the veranda. 
The estate, spread out before 



IF MONEY 



107 



them in utter disorder, was like 
the aftermath of an Intragalac- 
tic Sales Association picnic, with 
broken cases and bits of clothing 
and odd pieces of machinery lit- 
tering the lawn. 

The pilot balanced a strip of 
bacon on his fork and held it 
tentatively before his mouth. 
“You don’t suppose we slipped 
up anywhere, do you?” he asked. 
“These Dewontoites are cured?” 
“Oh, the cure wasn’t supposed 
to be instant and total. But from 
what we saw last night, we can 
be sure the anti-DUO principle is 
spreading like a plague by now.” 
Out of the corner of his eye, 
Anderson watched the butler 
peer furtively from behind a 
potted plant. Pretending not to 
notice, the pilot watched him tip- 
toe across the flagstone to the 
cocktail cart and deftly stuff three 
bottles under his coat. 

“See?” Bradley whispered, nod- 
ding unobtrusively toward the 
servant. “It’s working, all right.” 
There was stealthy movement 
in the adjacent east reception 
room and Anderson and the old 
man looked in through the double 
doors. Two of the upstairs maids 
were holding open a pillow case 
while a stable boy carefully filled 
it with silverware from one of 
the tables. 

Bradley made a victorious ges- 
ture of clasping his hands over 
his head. 



The butler who had pilfered 
the liquor came over to the break- 
fast table. “About my wages, 
sir — ” 

“Yes?” Anderson prompted 
hopefully. 

“From now on, I’ll expect the 
equivalent of a suit of clothes a 




108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



day, or anything of like value. 
Your promissory note will do.” 
“Fine! Fine!” Bradley ex- 
claimed. “You’ll be taken care 
of.” He turned to Anderson. 
“That ought to answer your ques- 
tion about whether these Dewon- 
toites are cured.” 



The pilot grinned. “I’m con- 
vinced.” He patted his breast 
pocket for the Subcon signal 
generator. “Ready to call Mother 
Ship?” 

But Bradley had dropped his 
elbows on the table and wedged 
his cheeks between his palms. He

was staring thoughtfully into the 
distance. 

“What’s the matter?” Anderson 
asked anxiously. 

“Just thinking.” 

The pilot waited, puzzling over 
the old man’s sudden dejection. 

“I wonder — ” Bradley began. 
“You know, son, I ain’t so sure 
we did the right thing here.” 

A NDERSON felt a little 
queasy, too. An indescribable 
consideration that had lain dor- 
mant at the back of his mind was 
calling for attention. Now that 
the cure had been effected, 
though, he was beginning to recog- 
nize what it was that had tried 
to hold him back. 

“Maybe we shouldn’t have in- 
terfered,” he suggested. 

“They did seem to be satisfied 
with their DUO system,” Bradley 
agreed. 

“And as scatterbrain as it was,” 
Anderson added thoughtfully, “it 
did work, didn’t it?” 

The old man nodded. “Yes. I 
got the impression they were a 
pretty happy people — like chil- 
dren — spritely little putpockets.” 
Anderson and Bradley laughed 
spuriously. The outburst was 
punctuated by an instant return 
of sober expressions. 

Anderson straightened. “But 
we did see some pretty rough 
poverty, didn’t we?” 

“It wasn’t so rough, I don’t 



suppose. Not when you consider 
it was self-imposed — and then 
only by the elite. The average 
person, no doubt, was much bet- 
ter off.” 

The pilot drummed the table 
with his fingers. “I hadn’t thought 
of that. Besides, poverty couldn’t 
have been a permanent feature of 
the system — not with the kind of 
surpluses they had knocking 
around. Eventually, as overpro- 
duction got worse, the natives 
would have been forced to live 
with more and more luxuries.” 
They were silent for a long, 
tense while. 

“You know, Walt,” Anderson 
said finally, “I didn’t think it 
would end up like this.” 

“You mean the looting — and 
the butler stealing?” 

“And the maids and the stable 
boy swiping the silverware.” 

“No. I guess they overcor- 
rected.” 

“And we can be damned sure 
that the same overcorrection will 
take place everywhere on the 
planet.” 

“But we didn’t plan it that 
way,” Bradley protested defen- 
sively. 

“Maybe not. But it happened 
just the same. And we caused it.” 
Anderson patted his coat again. 
“Where’s my Subcon?” 

“Here, use mine,” Bradley said, 
reaching into his jacket. “Just 
think —They probably never had 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a crime on Dewonto until now.” 

The pilot took the emergency 
signal generator. “The way I see 
it, they’ll quickly make up for lost 
time. Walt . .” 

“Yes?” 

“We’re prize bunglers, aren’t 
we?” 

“Stinkers would be a better 
word,” the old man said ruefully. 

“You suppose it’d help if we 
didn’t call Mother Ship? If we 
stayed here and — and — ” 

“And what?” 

Anderson shrugged futilely. 

“There’s nothing we can do 
now, boy. It was easy to crush 
the Golden Rule because the 
Brass Rule was so much more 
human. The pendulum’s already 
started swinging the other way 
now. I don’t see how we could 
stop it.” 

r |' , HE pilot sighed. “It would be 
* interesting to see what would 
have happened. We could have 
stayed here and let them saddle 
iis with the top jobs — emperor or 
president or big cheese of the 
planet.” 

Bindley straightened his mus- 
tnrhe with a stiff finger. “We 
could have ironed out the few 
inconsistencies in the system, 
Mtii-uglhened their Dewonto cul- 
tuir, kept nagging at them until 
they consented to higher and 
higher standards of living.” 

"But we would have seen to it 



that they stayed industrious.” 
“Of course. And we could have 
shown them how to use their sur- 
pulses without surrendering to 
selfishness and greed,” the old 
man said. “We could have given 
them a solid foundation.” 

“And when contact came 
around again in a couple of 
thousand years, they would have 
been strong enough not only to 
survive, but perhaps even to ‘cure’ 
the other culture.” 

They were pensively silent 
again. 

“No use supposing.” Bradley 
slapped his knees. “Too late to 
undo what we did.” 

Anderson returned his atten- 
tion to the old man’s Subcon. 
“Walt, this thing’s broken. The 
side’s caved in.” 

Bradley looked over. “Oh? 
Must have crushed it when I fell 
last night. Use yours.” 

Anderson rose and explored his 
pockets again. “Have to find it 
first. You suppose Gladys would 
understand if I told her we’re 
sorry about what’s happened?” 
“She won’t realize there’s any- 
thing to be sorry about until anti- 
DUO gets in full swing.” 

“I guess not.” Anderson shifted 
the breakfast plates around, 
searched behind the chaise 
longue, then went over to the 
cocktail cart. “That other Subcon 
should be around here some- 
where.”

Bradley’s head still rested 
languidly between his hands. “If 
you’re going to find it,” he said 
apathetically, “you’d better get a 
move on. Time’s growing short.” 

The pilot looked on the book- 
shelves, atop the mantel and 
between the cushions of several 
chairs. 

Scott!” Bradley called from the 
veranda. “Look who’s back!” 

Anderson went outside. Gladys 
and her father were standing 
uneasily beside the breakfast 
table. 

“Gladys!” the pilot exclaimed. 

“I — I thought that since my 
court assignment was over,” she 
said haltingly, “that we’d better 
settle up.” 

At least, he realized with con- 
siderable relief, the girl hadn’t 
been swept up in the tide of anti- 
DUO. 

“And,” he guessed, “you came 
back to give me something for 
letting you work for the court?” 

"DAP A Jerrel had wandered 
around the veranda, gaping 
at the evidences of wealth. Now 
he drew back closer to his daugh- 
ter and Anderson. 

“No.” The girl glanced down 
at the fiagstone. “Things are dif- 
ferent now. You’ve got to give me 
something . Papa!” 

The pilot’s spirits sagged. But 
then he started as he suddenly 
became conscious of the tailor’s 



hand slipping into his pocket. 

Embarrassed on being dis- 
covered, the girl’s father withdrew 
his hand immediately. 

Gladys reached into the pocket 
and pulled out a gold watch, 
handed it back to her father. 
“You don’t understand. You’re 
not supposed to be putpocketing!” 

She drew him aside and began 
a tedious explanation, accom- 
panied by flourishing hand ges- 
tures. 

“Mr. Anderson! Mr. Anderson!” 
It was the president of the Cham- 
ber of Commerce, who rounded 
the corner of the mansion, lead- 
ing a delegation of businessmen 
and manufacturers. Waving a 
printed form, he advanced across 
the flagstone. “Sign this! Sign 
this!” 

“What is it?” The pilot drew 
back warily. 

Bradley rose. “Never mind, son. 
Sign it. What difference does it 
make now?” 

Anderson signed. 

The delegation, whooping ela- 
tedly, marched off. 

“Thank you, sir,” the president 
threw back over his shoulder. 
“You just signed back over to us 
the downtown stores and offices 
and Hobo Heights, too.” 

Bradley shrugged indifferently. 
“They’re really catching on quick 
to this anti-DUO stuff, aren’t 
they?” 

Anderson, glancing through the 



112 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



double doors, spied the Subcon 
SOS signaler — lying on a coffee 
table. But as he strode toward it, 
the butler sneaked to the table, 
swept up the instrument and 
dumped it swiftly into his pocket. 

“Hey!” Anderson shouted. 

The butler turned to run. But 
he stumbled over a hassock and 
sprawled on the floor. When he 
regained his feet, he glowered 
disappointedly and withdrew the 
Subcon pack from his pocket — 
piece by piece. 

In stunned silence, Anderson 
became aware of Gladys’ low 
voice and gesturing hands as she 
continued her explanation to her 
father. 

“. So now that we realize 
they were merely dewontoing 
others as they wanted others to 
dewonto them, it wouldn’t be 
right for us to keep unloading on 
them. We just decided to stop 
putpocketing and everything else 

as far as they’re concerned.” 

I >APA Jerrel nodded under- 
standingly. “I see. But 
st might dewonto’s still the order 
of the day among everybody 
else.” 

“That’s right,” she said patron- 
izingly. “With them, we pick- 
pocket and trick and grab. It took 
a while for the average Dewonto- 
ilr to figure out that was what 
the spacemen wanted. And it 
took longer for the industrialists 



and businessmen to realize it — 
especially after they misinter- 
preted Mr. Bradley’s and Scott’s 
motives. But now we all know 
how to treat them.” 

It took a few moments for 
Anderson to begin to understand. 
When he glanced over at the car- 
tographer, Bradley was matching 
his grin. 

“I wouldn’t worry about those 
two busted Subcons,” Bradley 
said, looking at his watch. “It 
would be too late to use them 
anyway.” 

Gladys, still facing her father, 
shook her head disconsolately. 
“Actually, we should feel sorry 
for them. But — well, maybe 
someday they’ll become real 
Dewontoites, too.” 

Anderson took his diamond- 
studded Academy pin from his 
lapel and crossed over to the girl 
and her father. 

Lacking finesse, he completely 
bungled the job of getting her 
handbag open without her know- 
ing it. But before she could pull 
away, he dropped the pin inside. 

“Scott!” she exclaimed happily, 
apparently not at all regretting 
being made a putpocket victim. 

“You wouldn’t happen to 
know,” he asked, taking her arm, 
“where a guy could find a 
decrepit, broken-down shack in 
need of repair, but big enough to 
raise a family in?”

THE UGGLIANS by L. M. 
Fallaw. Philosophical Library, 
New York, $3.00 

A N astonishing release from a 
publishing house that has 
become noted for the richness of 
its non-fiction and the poverty of 
its S-F. 

Ugg I, known affectionately as 
Uggli to his converts, is a 7 V 2 
foot, 450 lb. central African ruler 
who has evolved the Word. In 
return for fine promises of future 
welfare, mankind will hand over 
valuable objects, he discovers. In 
a vision, he is called to America 



to spread the Word of the Great 
Black Father. Two hundred and 
fifty suns later, his female con- 
sort and he sail their canoe into 
New York harbor, past the huge 
idol of a torch-carrying female. 
“Devil-worshipers,” he says. 

After establishing himself in a 
tent in Central Park, he proceeds 
to convert the natives so success- 
fully that he acquires the services 
of a business manager, formerly 
with the biggest evangelist, 
Johnny Tuesday. Only a handful 
can withstand him, including a 
critical reporter on whom he uses 
his most persuasive methods.

“Get saved,” Ugg begs. “Get lost,” 
the reporter says, but declines a 
game of buffum with Ugg, played 
with twenty-pound clubs until a 
winner is declared — the one who 
stays alive. 

This is a lashing book, but as 
worth reading as Dean Swift’s 
stinging satires. 

THE NAKED SUN by Isaac 
Asimov. Doubleday & Co., Inc. 
New York, $2.95 

¥3 DANEEL OLIVA W, as we 
know from The Caves of 
Steel, is a collateral descendant of 
I, Robot, not to mention Adam 
Link, which I’d rather not. He is 
a completely humanoid robot 
detective. In fact, to be truthful, 
he’s more human at times than 
his partner, Elijah Baley, the 
Earth detective who is called for 
by the ex-colonist Spacers, now 
independent nationals who despise 
the mother planet. For some hid- 
den political reasons, the con- 
temptible Earthman has been 
summoned to Solaria to solve a 
murder that could have been 
committed by only one person. 

Baley, reared in the teeming 
underground Terran Cities, is af- 
flicted with agoraphobia like all 
Earthmen. In turn, all Spacers 
have their phobias based on their 
underpopulated existence. Know- 
ing this, Baley attempts to refuse 



the assignment, but he cannot. 
This is a unique opportunity for 
quarantined Earth to acquire 
vital information about its former 
colonists and future adversaries, 
the Spacers. Baley must serve a 
two-pronged purpose. 

Caves of Steel had a hypnotic 
quality because of the graphic 
picture that Asimov drew of the 
enwombed trogloditic society of 
the future. His current book, in 
comparison, is completely alien in 
environment and adds - up to an 
interesting exercise in scientific 
detection. 

However, in that direction, 
Asimov appears to be laying the 
groundwork for a new category 
of science fiction, the S-F detec- 
tive story. It is strange that 
Asimov should be the pioneer, 
since so many of our favorite 
authors double in the detective- 
mystery field. 

THE FROZEN YEAR by James 
Blish. Ballantine Books, New 
York, $2.75 

the flyleaf, Ballantine calls 
this a “contemporary novel” 
as distinguished from Blish’s sci- 
ence fiction output. Don’t you 
believe it. Martians and missing 
proto-planets are something less 
— or considerably more — than 
contemporary. 

Blish has succeeded in writing 



★ ★★★★ sheif 



115 



an exasperating book. He starts 
as if penning the satirical novel of 
the year. The story takes place 
during the International Geo- 
physical Year and concerns the 
tribulations of a science writer 
assigned to a fantastic polar expe- 
dition. The expedition leader, a 
Charles Atlas type, is a publicity 
hound married to a Kathleen 
Windsor type historical - novel 
writer. 

Quite a combination. 

The expedition proper is com- 
posed of scientific misfits and 
incompetents. It has received its 
inadequate financial backing from 
numerous commercial firms who 
hope to win cheap advertising for 
their products by what might be 
called “Polar Promotion.” Then 
IGY comes along and gives offi- 
cial sanction. 

So far, Blish stays on solid 
ground. 

His coldly sarcastic style and 
his punny corporate names pre- 
pare his reader for a light-hearted 
whacky job. But he switches in 
mid-ice, so to speak, and winds 
up with a serious adventure- 
tragedy. No great crime, certain- 
ly: Bernard Wolfe ran amok 

stylistically in Limbo, yet what 
emerged was an enormous tour 
de force. One cannot say as much 
for Frozen Year, but it will make 
for cool, adventurous reading on 
a sweltering day.

EMPIRE OF THE ATOM by 
A. E. Van Vogt. Shasta Pub- 
lishers, Chicago, $3.00 

A RETURN to publishing of 
one of the pioneers in the 
field is a welcome event in itself. 
It could be wished that the effort 
were deserving of worthier fruit, 
but still the occasion is a cheer- 
ing one. 

Van Vogt’s book is based on 
material from Astounding of a 
decade ago and the intervening 
years haven’t altered my opinion 
of this work. 

You may recall that he en- 
visages a feudal culture, 10,000 
years or so in our future, that has 
inherited atomic energy and 
space travel as well as a shattered 
world from its distant ancestors. 

If meant as a frolicsome bur- 
lesque, the paradoxes of such a 
societal hash could be swallowed. 
After all, a spaceship represents 
more than merely a mode of 
travel. The requisite technology, 
not for creation, but merely for 
maintenance, thoroughly destroys 
one of the book’s intended high- 
spots, in which a fleet of space- 
ships makes a strafing run over 
the enemy, loosing flights of ar- 
rows from point-blank range. 

It should bring to mind the 
original movie of “Connecticut 
Yankee,” the delightful scene 
in which Will Rogers leads a 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cavalry charge of miniature 
Austin automobiles. It should, but 
it doesn’t — Van Vogt’s tongue 
was anywhere but in his cheek, 
where it belonged. 

THE RANGER BOYS IN 
SPACE by Hal Clement. L. C. 
Page & Co., Boston, $2.75 

COME will say that Clement 
has reached his true audience 
with this, his first juvenile. Con- 
census has it that his youngsters 
and aliens emerge as humans, 
while his adult humans emerge 
as alien. It’s not for want of try- 
ing; when depicting adult humans, 
Clement has been very trying 
indeed. 

His deliberate title is un- 
equaled since Starship on Saddle 
Mountain. You see, “Ranger” is 
the surname of Bart and Dart. 

The boys and their friend, 
Peter Ashburn, are wards of their 
Uncle Jim, an explorer and scien- 
tist. The story starts with the 
failure of the space satellite and 
rocket projects and the return of 
their invalided guardian. Because 
of malfunction of the inner ear 
during weightlessness, Uncle Jim 
has attempted to inure himself 
to zero gravity at the station 
along with others and all have 
succumbed, their innate balance 
chronically disturbed. 



Peter proposes that younger 
people might be more adaptable, 
since fewer years have been spent 
believing the evidence of the 
senses. In desperation, Uncle Jim 
uses the boys and a young spy 
as guinea pigs. 

It is almost a truism that 
Clement’s books never smile, but 
he pens a credible, workmanlike 
and always interesting yarn. First 
of a series.

Fellow City Mgrs., only you can 
help me — progress has made 
"Go Fight City Hall" a battle cry! 

Illustrated by DILLON 



TO : ALL CITY MANAGERS 
FROM: ROSS RO, NEW YORK CITY 
' MANAGER 

SUBJECT: GELATIN MOLDS 

W ELL, boys, this is going 
to be rather an informal 
communication because 
I think there’s a serious lesson for 
you in a situation we had here re- 
cently. I might as well be the first 
to tell you about it. You’ll hear 

118 



about it soon enough anyway. 
Frankly, I’m hoping you’ll have 
a heart and lend a brother City 
Manager a hand. 

As you boys know, I was re- 
elected last April to my post as 
City Manager for another four 
years and I felt pretty good about 
it. So good that I was looking 
around for something to do which 
would sort of let the voters of little 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



old New York know how I felt 
about them. Most of you have met 
my political assistant Charlie 
Tight — or, rather, my ex-political 
assistant. Charlie was looking 
around, too, and he came up with 
the idea of covering over Central 
Park. 

We have never covered over 
Central Park with the perma-plast 
roof like the rest of the city be- 
cause it is a fairly large area and 
there wasn’t any public demand 
for it. So naturally it rains and 
snows there and we spend a lot 
of dough keeping the grass cut 
and what have you. It’s a popular 
spot with a lot of folks. 

Charlie figured — and I must 
admit that I agreed with him — 
that covering over Central Park 
was quite an idea. Controlled con- 
ditions would let the grass grow 
only so much and the temperature 
would remain constant. No rain 
or snow except from 1 a.m. to 3 
a.m., when we would put in a little 
artificial precipitation to keep the 
greenery going. Plenty of nice 
air-conditioned air. Eternal spring. 
Really up-to-date. 

We put it through the computer 
down at the Civic Machine and 
figured it would cost only about 
25 hundred million. It looked real 
good. You see, we recently got a 
new addition to the Civic Machine 
and the manufacturer gave us a 
deal on a new model Projector for 
the whole city. It makes constant 



forecasts on practically everything 
we need from moment to moment. 
It doesn’t wait for a Tech to run 
the data thru it. Saves a lot of 
time because it’s directly con- 
nected with Supply. 

This Projector is so good that 
we have been able to cut down 
on expenses about 20 hundred 
million in only two years. I figured 
this would easily pay for the 
perma-plast roof over good old 
Central Park. 

nPO MAKE a long story short, 
I went before the people on 
TV and told the whole story. 
Charlie had the TV Techs mock 
up a scene of what it would look 
like and we had models posed in 
family scenes and the like. Should 
have gone over like a shot — and 
it would have, except for this 
screwball Hatty Dakkon. 

It wasn’t an hour after I had 
made my broadcast that my secre- 
tary announced this Mrs. Hatty 
Dakkon. She proved to be a young 
matron type with pretty good legs 
and a chip on her shoulder. She 
was against roofing Central Park. 

Well, you boys know how it 
goes. Always some crank who 
doesn’t like things changed, and 
after they have blown off steam, 
they quiet down and you can go 
ahead and do the work. 

So I let this Hatty Dakkon talk 
on and on until my ears were limp 
from listening. 



MAKE ME AN OFFER 



119 



She said she was against roofing 
Central Park because it would be 
just like every other place in the 
City — weatherproof, air-condi- 
tioned and humidity controlled. 

She figured that children should 
have some place where they could 
feel the wind on their faces and 
the falling of rain and snow and 
the smell of air as it was in nature. 

She said that was the only way 
most of our children could ever, 
ever find the ties with the past 
that were sacred. 

She quoted poetry about the 
wind and the rain in your hair, 
and on and on and on. 

Finally I let her talk off her 
head of steam and she got calmed 
down so I could tell her: “Thank 
you, madam, for this expression 
of your opinion. You can rest 
assured that I will do everything 
within my power and the power 
of the Civic Machine to see to it 
that anything possible is done.” 

Her head came up like a rocket 
at blastoff. 

“Hold it!” she said. “You can’t 
put me off with that old one — 
that’s Standard Answer No. 1 in 
the City Manager’s guidebook and 
I ain’t buying it, Buster. I used to 
work at the Civic Machine my- 
self, so I know all the Standard 
Answers backward and forward.” 

“Well, I assure you, madam — ” 
I said. 

“Don’t hand me that stuff again. 
What I want is for you to call off 

120 



the Civic Machine and quit try- 
ing to roof the only place left 
where our children can feel the 
open air and sunshine.” 

“I see. You aren’t going to be 
satisfied with anything else,” ] 
said. 

“That’s right.” 

“I’m sorry, but thaf s impossible 
We have programmed the roofing 
job for next month on the Civic 
Machine and we can’t change it 
now.” 

“That, Mr. Ro, is a lie,” she said, 
leaning across my desk and stick- 
ing a slim white finger under my 
nose. “I know you can change it 
in five minutes if you want to.” 

“It won’t be changed,” I said. 

“Is that your final word?” 

“Final.” 

“Mr. Ro,” she said, putting her 
hands on her hips, “I think you’ll 
be sorry.” 

She headed for the door, only 
to turn around and ask me if my 
wife was at home. 

“I suppose she is,” I said, “but 
don’t bother her — she takes no 
interest in Civic affairs.” 

I don’t have to tell you boys 
that I dismissed the lady from my 
mind and went on to other more 
important matters. Or so I thought. 

YV7 HEN I got home that night, 
I didn’t say anything about 
Hatty Dakkon. My wife is in- 
clined to see things differently 
than I do and I had a hunch she 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



would side with Hatty. Conse- 
quently, rather than get into a dis- 
cussion, I just let it slide. 

Not too many of you boys know 
my wife, but those who do know 
that she is like so many other 
women — not particularly inter- 
ested in any Civic Machine. Just 
so she gets what she wants when 
she dials the home connection to 
the Machine is all she is interested 
in. 

That night, though, my wife 
surprised me by having a burning 
interest in the Civic Machine. She 
wanted to know all about it. How 
it produces the consumer products. 
How it gets them to the living area. 
How it knows what to order. And 
she especially quizzed me about 
the new Projector. 

When I asked her why she 
wanted to know about all that af- 
ter 15 years of married life, she 
just smiled sweetly and said that 
naturally she was interested in my 
work. 

TVTEXT day, I brought home a 

" sample programming sheet 
for her to see and damned if she 
didn’t dismiss it with a sniff as 
being too complicated and boring. 

Go figure women out! 

That night, we had two molded 
gelatin dishes. The round kind 
with a hole in the center. 

The next night, we had the same 
kind of supper, except that instead 
of fish and something in gelatin, 



we had meat and something in 
gelatin. Same sort of deal for 
dessert. 

The next day, I got my first tip 
that something was up when Willie 
Kipe, the caster for NYC-TV, 
called me and asked about the 
protest on the Central Park roof- 
ing proposal, saying he got the 
item from his woman assistant. I 
said it didn’t amount to much and 
that the project was going ahead 
on schedule. 

I caught Willie’s cast that night 
and he treated it in a light manner 
which really made me smile. I 
should have been crying instead. 

That night, we had some more 
molded gelatin, only in square 
molds this time. Same thing the 
next day. I figured it was time to 
take a stand — a diplomatic one, 
of course. 

“Honey,” I said as I sat toying 
with my food, “can’t we have dif- 
ferent dishes every night? I’m get- 
ting tired of all this gelatin junk. 
How about a steak?” 

“But, darling, gelatin is very 
good for you. It’s simply crammed 
full of protein and all the girls at 
the club are eating lots of gelatin.” 

“But I don’t like gelatin that 
well,” I said. 

“I don’t, either, but it’s so good 
for both of us,” she said with her 
best don’t-try-to-argue-Mother- 
knows-best smile. 

I had a steak that night after she 
went to bed.

'T 1 HE next day, I got a call from 
the head of the warehousing 
division over at Civic, asking me if 
I had any preference on warehous- 
ing molds. 

“What molds?” I wanted to 
know. 

“Well, let’s see,” he said. “We’ve 
got 3.5 million round gelatin molds 
with a hole in the center. We’ve got 
5.6 million square gelatin molds — 
no center hole. And 7.3 million 
figure-eight gelatin molds and I 
understand there’s a hell of a lot of 
deep-dish gelatin molds coming up 
tomorrow from Supply at Schenec- 
tady.” 

“Why in hell have we got all 
those molds?” 

“Don’t know,” he said. “Civic 
Machine ordered them, so I sup- 
pose we need them. Where do you 
want the storing done? Thought 
we might run up one of those 
new Kiosk warehouses out east if 
you have no objection.” 

“Put it anywhere you want,” I 
said, switching off. 

Before I could get back to work, 
there was a call from Stats. 

“Got a little problem down here, 
Mr. Ro,” said the Tech. “Schenec- 
tady is sending us premium billing 
on an over-order of plastic.” 

“How much is the premium?” 

“Quite a little, Boss — about 10 
hundred million or thereabouts. 
I checked with them and the rea- 
son for the extra strong premium 
is because they had to rebuild the 

122 



factory — let’s see which one that 
was — oh, yes, cold-molding dishes 
division of the Cooking Receptacle 
plant. What do you want me to do 
— enter a protest saying we aren’t 
responsible and get it over to Fed 
Court where they can pro-rate it 
over the other cities?” 

“Nope, I guess you’d just better 
pay it.” 

The chips were falling into place 
now and I didn’t like what they 
were building for me. 

As soon as I switched off, I put 
in a call to my head Tech at the 
Civic Machine and asked for a run- 
down on the food ordered for sup- 
per for the past six or eight nights. 
It took a while, but when I got it 
back, it was enough to make my 
hair curl and uncurl in three-quar- 
ter time. 

First thing I did was call my 
wife and ask her what we were 
having for dinner that night. 

“We’re having your favorite — 
steak and kidney pie, dear,” she 
said in that innocent-little-girl 
voice that means there’s trouble 
ahead. 

“No more of those gelatin dishes, 
sweet?” 

“No more of that awful gelatin, 
darling. I’m so tired of it. But I did 
order a pair of nice shears today — 
you know, sweetheart, scissors?” 

“Yes, dear. That’s nice,” I said, 
trying to smooth down the hair on 
the back of my neck, which was 
standing straight up. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“The Civic Machine didn’t have 
any scissors, darling, so I told it 
go ahead and get me a pair regard- 
less of the wait. That was all right, 
wasn’t it, dear?” 

“Fine, dear, fine.” 

“I can’t imagine why the Civic 
Machine should be out of just 
plain old six-inch scissors, can 
you?” 

“Just can’t imagine, darling. 
Good-by.” 

“Good-by, sweetie.” 

1%/T Y HAND was shaking when 
I called the Tech at the Civic 
Machine and asked him to check 
up on the orders for scissors. 

It took a minute or two, and 
when he came back, his face was 
puzzled. 

“Funny thing, Boss— there is an 
order for just under 10 million 
pairs of scissors. That’s more than 
we have had in the past seven or 
eight years. All ordered last night. 
There must be a mistake some- 
where. I’ll run it through again and 
have a test made of the orders 
section.” 

“Never mind. Just do this,” I 
said. “Fix up the Projector so it 
doesn’t send out any order for 
scissors and cancel any order that 
has been placed.” I was wringing 
wet with sweat. It was going to be 
a close one. 

Believe me, boys, I didn’t waste 
any time getting on FAX and TV, 
telling everyone that there had 



been a change in plans due to 
public demand and we weren’t go- 
ing to be able to roof over Central 
Park after all. I suggested that, as 
long as the administration had co- 
operated, the people should coop- 
erate on the matter. 

An hour later, I called the Civic 
Machine and asked for a check on 
scissors. The orders had dropped 
to a mere 5.4 million. Way above 
normal, but the way the cancella- 
tions were coming in, it was obvi- 
ous that it would be within reason- 
able proportions soon. 

Just in case some of you missed 
the by-play on that, let me sketch 
it in for you as I found it out later. 

It seems that this Hatty Dak- 
kon had organized a phone cam- 
paign on the Let Our Children 
Enjoy Nature theme which went 
over big with the women. Every 
woman called five woman friends 
and these five called five and so 
on. You figure it out — with geo- 
metrical progression, it doesn’t 
take long to get in touch with 
about 14-15 million women. Not 
as fast as TV, maybe, but a darn 
sight more effective and thorough. 

It was the talk of the women’s 
world and we men didn’t even 
know about it until the battle was 
all over. 

This horde of women, led by 
Hatty Dakkon, agreed that they 
would order the same dish— gela- 
tin in a round mold on the same 
night.

You know what this can do to a 
good Projector. It just went fran- 
tic. 

Projectors work on the basis 
of average demand for anything, 
and with an average demand for 
round mold gelatin foods two 
nights in a row of about 10-11 
million, it went ahead and or- 
dered a whole conveyor-load of 
mold dishes from Schenectady. 

The next time, it was square 
molds for two nights; and the next, 
it was figure-eight for two nights 
and then a double shot of deep- 
dish. 

T HEY have a new Projector up 
at Schenectady, same as we 
have, and it ordered an increase 
in the size of the mold-making 
factory based on our demand 
(which was run in with everyone 
else’s demand). Then, when the 
demand didn’t come through 
from us and from the other cities 
in the area, we had to pay the 



premium for building the new 
factory. 

The scissors business would 
have bankrupted us completely. 
Think of it— millions of pairs of 
steel scissors in the year 2006! 
Think of the premium for increase 
in size of factory, prospecting the 
planets, mining, spaceship freight 
rates, and so forth. That’s why I 
was glad to give up the Central 
Park project. 

Well, to make a long story short, 
we aren’t going near Central Park. 
And Charlie, who originally 
thought of the idea, is probably 
out there now, wondering why he 
did it. 

Now in closing, I hope all the 
rest of you who have had a good 
laugh will sober up and sympa- 
thize with me and see what you 
can do about ordering gelatin 
molds from us. We’ll ship them out 
pronto— we have a large supply— 
and no reasonable offer will be re- 
fused. Please, fellows!

and allies, both — that had en- 
gulfed the country in successive 
waves and bought or taken the 
women. So there was no trouble 
that way. 

Sometimes he wondered who 
Ninian really was. Obviously that

story about her coming from the 
future was just a gag. Besides, if 
she really was his great-great- 
grand-daughter, as she said, why 
would she tell him to call her 
‘‘Aunt Ninian”? Maybe he was 
only eleven, but he’d been around

and he knew just what the score 
was. At first he’d thought maybe 
she was some new kind of social 
worker, but she acted a little too 
crazy for that. 

He loved to bait her, as he had 
loved to bait his mother. It was 
safer with Ninian, though, be- 
cause when he pushed her too far, 
she would cry instead of mopping 
up the floor with him. 

“But I can’t understand,” he 
would say, keeping his face 
straight. “Why do you have to 
come from the future to protect 
me against your cousin Conrad?” 

“Because he’s coming to kill 
you.” 

“Why should he kill me? I ain’t 
done him nothing.” 

Ninian sighed. “He’s dissatisfied 
with the current social order and 
killing you is part of an elaborate 
plan he’s formulated to change it. 
You wouldn’t understand.” 

“You’re damn right. I don’t un- 
derstand. What’s it all about in 
straight gas?” 

“Oh, just don’t ask any ques- 
tions,” Ninian said petulantly. 
“When you get older, someone 
will explain the whole thing to 
you.” 

S O MARTIN held his peace, 
because, on the whole, he 
liked things the way they were. 
Ninian really was the limit, 
though. All the people he knew 
lived in scabrous tenement apart- 

128 



ments like his, but she seemed to 
think it was disgusting. 

“So if you don’t like it, clean 
it up,” he suggested. 

She looked at him as if he were 
out of his mind. 

“Hire a maid, then!” he jeered. 

And darned if that dope didn’t 
go out and get a woman to come 
clean up the place! He was so 
embarrassed, he didn’t even dare 
show his face in the streets — 
especially with the women but- 
tonholing him and demanding to 
know what gave. They tried talk- 
ing to Ninian, but she certainly 
knew how to give them the cold 
shoulder. 

One day the truant officer came 
to ask why Martin hadn’t been 
coming to school. Very few of the 
neighborhood kids attended 
classes very regularly, so this was 
just routine. But Ninian didn’t 
know that and she went into a 
real tizzy, babbling that Martin 
had been sick and would make up 
the work. Martin nearly did get 
sick from laughing so hard inside. 

But he laughed out of the other 
side of his mouth when she went 
out and hired a private tutor for 
him. A tutor — in that neighbor- 
hood! Martin had to beat up 
every kid on the block before he 
could walk a step without hearing 
“Fancy Pants!” yelled after him. 

Ninian worried all the time. It 
wasn’t that she cared what these 
people thought of her, for she 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



made no secret of regarding them 
as little better than animals, but 
she was shy of attracting atten- 
tion. There were an awful lot of 
people in that neighborhood who 
felt exactly the same way, only 
she didn’t know that, either. She 
was really pretty dumb, Martin 
thought, for all her fancy lingo. 

“It’s so hard to think these 
things out without any prior prac- 
tical application to go by,” she 
told him. 

He nodded, knowing what she 
meant was that everything was 
coming out wrong. But he didn’t 
try to help her; he just watched 
to see what she’d do next. Al- 
ready he had begun to assume the 
detached role of a spectator. 

When it became clear that his 
mother was never going to show 
up again, Ninian bought one of 
those smallish, almost identical 
houses that mushroom on the 
fringes of a city after every war, 
particularly where intensive 
bombing has created a number of 
desirable building sites. 

“This is a much better neigh- 
borhood for a boy to grow up in,” 
she declared. “Besides, it’s easier 
to keep an eye on you here.” 

And keep an eye on him she 
did — she or a rather foppish 
young man who came to stay with 
them occasionally. Martin was 
told to call him Uncle Raymond. 

From time to time, there were 
other visitors — Uncles Ives and 



Bartholomew and Olaf, Aunts Ot- 
tillie and Grania and Lalage, and 
many more — all cousins to one 
another, he was told, all descend- 
ants of his. 

H/f ARTIN was never left alone 
for a minute. He wasn’t al- 
lowed to play with the other kids 
in the new neighborhood. Not that 
their parents would have let 
them, anyway. The adults obvi- 
ously figured that if a one-car 
family hired private tutors for 
their kid, there must be some- 
thing pretty wrong with him. So 
Martin and Ninian were just as 
conspicuous as before. But he 
didn’t tip her off. She was grown 
up; she was supposed to know 
better than he did. 

He lived well. He had food to 
eat that he’d never dreamed of 
before, warm clothes that no one 
had ever worn before him. He 
was surrounded by more luxury 
than he knew what to do with. 

The furniture was the latest 
New Grand Rapids African mod- 
ern. There were tidy, colorful Pi- 
casso and Braque prints on the 
walls. And every inch of the floor 
was modestly covered by carpet- 
ing, though the walls were mostly 
unabashed glass. There were hot 
water and heat all the time and a 
freezer well stocked with food — 
somewhat erratically chosen, for 
Ninian didn’t know much about 
meals. 



THE MAN OUTSIDE 



129 



The non-glass part of the house 
was of neat, natural-toned wood, 
with a neat green lawn in front 
and a neat parti-colored garden 
in back. 

Martin missed the old neigh- 
borhood, though. He missed hav- 
ing other kids to play with. He 
even missed his mother. Sure, she 
hadn’t given him enough to eat 
and she’d beaten him up so hard 
sometimes that she’d nearly killed 
him — but then there had also 
been times when she’d hugged 
and kissed him and soaked his 
collar with her tears. She’d done 
all she could for him, supporting 
him in the only way she knew 
how — and if respectable society 
didn’t like it, the hell with re- 
spectable society. 

From Ninian and her cousins, 
there was only an impersonal 
kindness. They made no bones 
about the fact that they were 
there only to carry out a rather 
unpleasant duty. Though they 
were in the house with him, in 
their minds and in their talk they 
were living in another world — a 
world of warmth and peace and 
plenty where nobody worked, ex- 
cept in the government service or 
the essential professions. And 
they seemed to think even that 
kind of job was pretty low-class, 
though better than actually doing 
anything with the hands. 

In their world, Martin came to 
understand, nobody worked with 

130 



hands; everything was done by 
machinery. All the people ever 
did was wear pretty clothes and 
have good times and eat all they 
wanted. There was no devasta- 
tion, no war, no unhappiness, none 
of the concomitants of normal 
living. 

It was then that Martin began 
to realize that either the whole 
lot of them were insane, or what 
Ninian had told him at first was 
the truth. They came from the 
future. 

W HEN Martin was sixteen, 
Raymond took him aside for 
the talk Ninian had promised five 
years before. 

“The whole thing’s all my bro- 
ther Conrad’s fault. You see, he’s 
an idealist,” Raymond explained, 
pronouncing the last word with 
distaste. 

Martin nodded gravely. He was 
a quiet boy now, his brief past a 
dim and rather ridiculous mem- 
ory. Who could ever imagine him 
robbing a grocery store or wield- 
ing a broken bottle now? He still 
was rather undersized and he’d 
read so much that he’d weakened 
his eyes and had to wear glasses. 
His face was pallid, because he 
spent little time in the sun, and 
his speech rather overbred, his 
mentors from the future having 
carefully eradicated all current 
vulgarities. 

“And Conrad really got upset 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



over the way Earth has been ex- 
ploiting the not so intelligent 
life-forms on the other planets,” 
Raymond continued. “Which is 
distressing— though, of course, it’s 
not as if they were people. Be- 
sides, the government has been 
talking about passing laws to do 
away with the — well, abuses and 
things like that, and I’m sure 
someday everything will come out 
all right. However, Conrad is so 
impatient.” 

“I thought, in your world, ma- 
chines did all the work,” Martin 
suggested. 

“I’ve told you — our world is 
precisely the same as this one!” 
Raymond snapped. “We just come 
a couple of centuries or so later, 
that’s all. But remember, our in- 
terests are identical. We’re virtu- 
ally the same people . although 
it is amazing what a difference 
two hundred odd years of prog- 
ress and polish can make in a 
species, isn’t it?” 

He continued more mildly: 
“However, even you ought to be 
able to understand that we can’t 
make machinery without metal. 
We need food. All that sort of 
thing comes from the out-system 
planets. And, on those worlds, it’s 
far cheaper to use native labor 
than to ship out all that expensive 
machinery. After all, if we didn’t 
give the natives jobs, how would 
they manage to live?” 

“How did they live before? 



Come to think of it, if you don’t 
work, how do you live now? . 
I don’t mean in the now for me, 
but the now for you,” Martin ex- 
plained laboriously. It was so dif- 
ficult to live in the past and think 
in the future. 

“I’m trying to talk to you as if 
you were an adult,” Raymond 
said, “but if you will persist in 
these childish interruptions—” 

“I’m sorry,” Martin said. 

But he wasn’t, for by now he 
had little respect left for any of 
his descendants. They were all 
exceedingly handsome and culti- 
vated young people, with supe- 
rior educations, smooth ways of 
speaking and considerable self- 
confidence, but they just weren’t 
very bright. And he had discov- 
ered that Raymond was perhaps 
the most intelligent of the lot. 
Somewhere in that relatively 
short span of time, his line or — 
more frightening — his race had 
lost something vital. 

Unaware of the near-contempt 
in which his young ancestor held 
him, Raymond went on blandly: 
“Anyhow, Conrad took it upon 
himself to feel particularly guilty, 
because, he decided, if it hadn’t 
been for the fact that our great- 
grandfather discovered the super- 
drive, we might never have 
reached the stars. Which is ridic- 
ulous — his feeling guilty, I mean. 
Perhaps a great-grandfather is re- 
sponsible for his great-grandchil- 



THE MAN OUTSIDE 



131 



dren, but a great-grandchild can 
hardly be held accountable for 
his great-grandfather.” 

“How about a great-great- 
grandchild?” Martin couldn’t help 
asking. 

R AYMOND flushed a delicate 
pink. “Do you want to hear 
the rest of this or don’t you?” 
“Oh, I do!” Martin said. He 
had pieced the whole thing to- 
gether for himself long since, but 
he wanted to hear how Raymond 
would put it. 

“Unfortunately, Professor Far- 
kas has just perfected the time 
transmitter. Those government 
scientists are so infernally offi- 
cious — always inventing such 
senseless things. It’s supposed to 
be hush-hush, but you know how 
news will leak out when one is 
always desperate for a fresh topic 
of conversation.” 

Anyhow, Raymond went on to 
explain, Conrad had bribed one 
of Farkas’ assistants for a set of 
the plans. Conrad’s idea had been 
to go back in time and “elimi- 
nate” their common great-grand- 
father. In that way, there would 
be no space-drive, and, hence, the 
Terrestrials would never get to 
the other planets and oppress the 
local aborigines. 

“Sounds like a good way of 
dealing with the problem,” Mar- 
tin observed. 

Raymond looked annoyed. “It’s 

132 



the adolescent way,” he said, “to 
do away with it, rather than find 
a solution. Would you destroy a 
whole society in order to root out 
a single injustice?” 

“Not if it were a good one 
otherwise.” 

“Well, there’s your answer. 
Conrad got the apparatus built, or 
perhaps he built it himself. One 
doesn’t inquire too closely into 
such matters. But when it came 
to the point, Conrad couldn’t bear 
the idea of eliminating our great- 
grandfather — because our great- 
grandfather was such a good man, 
you know.” Raymond’s expressive 
upper lip curled. “So Conrad de- 
cided to go further back still and 
get rid of his great-grandfather’s 
father — who’d been, by all ac- 
counts, a pretty worthless char- 
acter.” 

“That would be me, I suppose,” 
Martin said quietly. 

Raymond turned a deep rose. 
“Well, doesn’t that just go to 
prove you mustn’t believe every- 
thing you hear?” The next sen- 
tence tumbled out in a rush. “I 
wormed the whole thing out of 
him and all of us — the other cou- 
sins and me — held a council of 
war, as it were, and we decided it 
was our moral duty to go back in 
time ourselves and protect you.” 
He beamed at Martin. 

The boy smiled slowly. “Of 
course. You had to. If Conrad 
succeeded in eliminating me, then 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



none of you would exist, would 
you?” 

Raymond frowned. Then he 
shrugged cheerfully. “Well, you 
didn’t really suppose we were go- 
ing to all this trouble and expense 
out of sheer altruism, did you?” 
he asked, turning on the charm 
which all the cousins possessed to 
a consternating degree. 

1%/T ARTIN had, of course, no 
illusions on that score; he 
had learned long ago that nobody 
did anything for nothing. But say- 
ing so was unwise. 

“We bribed another set of plans 
out of another of the professor’s 
assistants,” Raymond continued, 
as if Martin had answered, “and 
— ah — induced a handicraft en- 
thusiast to build the gadget for 
us.” 

Induced, Martin knew, could 
have meant anything from black- 
mail to the use of the iron maiden. 

“Then we were all ready to 
forestall Conrad. If one of us 
guarded you night and day, he 
would never be able to carry out 
his plot. So we made our counter- 
plan, set the machine as far back 
as it would go — and here we are!” 

“I see,” Martin said. 

Raymond didn’t seem to think 
he really did. “After all,” he 
pointed out defensively, “what- 
ever our motives, it has turned 
into a good thing for you. Nice 
home, cultured companions, all 



the contemporary conveniences, 
plus some handy anachronisms — 
I don’t see what more you could 
ask for. You’re getting the best of 
all possible worlds. Of course 
Ninian was a ninny to locate in a 
mercantile suburb where any lit- 
tle thing out of the way will cause 
talk. How thankful I am that our 
era has completely disposed of 
the mercantiles — ” 

“What did you do with them?” 
Martin asked. 

But Raymond rushed on : “Soon 
as Ninian goes and I’m in full 
charge, we’ll get a more isolated 
place and run it on a far grander 
scale. Ostentation— that’s the way 
to live here and now; the richer 
you are, the more eccentricity 
you can get away with. And,” he 
added, “I might as well be as com- 
fortable as possible while I suffer 
through this wretched historical 
stint.” 

“So Ninian’s going,” said Martin, 
wondering why the news made 
him feel curiously desolate. Be- 
cause, although he supposed he 
liked her in a remote kind of way, 
he had no fondness for her — or 
she, he knew, for him. 

“Well, five years is rather a 
long stretch for any girl to spend 
in. exile,” Raymond explained, 
“even though our life spans are a 
bit longer than yours. Besides, 
you’re getting too old now to be 
under petticoat government.” He 
looked inquisitively at Martin. 



THE MAN OUTSIDE 



133 



“You’re not going to go all weepy 
and make a scene when she 
leaves, are you?” 

“No . .” Martin said hesitantly. 
“Oh, I suppose I will miss her. 
But we aren’t very close, so it 
won’t make a real difference.” 
That was the sad part : he already 
knew it wouldn’t make a differ- 
ence. 

Raymond clapped him on the 
shoulder. “I knew you weren’t a 
sloppy sentimentalist like Conrad. 
Though you do have rather a look 
of him, you know.” 

Suddenly that seemed to make 
Conrad real. Martin felt a vague 
itirring of alarm. He kept his 
voice composed, however. “How 
do you plan to protect me when 
he comes?” 

“Well, each one of us is armed 
to the teeth, of course,” Raymond 
said with modest pride, display- 
ing something that looked like a 
child’s combination spaceman’s 
gun and death ray, but which, 
Martin had no doubt, was a per- 
fectly genuine — and lethal — 
weapon. “And we’ve got a rather 
elaborate burglar alarm system.” 

Martin inspected the system 
and made one or two changes in 
the wiring which, he felt, would 
increase its efficiency. But still he 
was dubious. “Maybe it’ll work on 
someone coming from outside this 
house, but do you think it will 
work on someone coming from 
outside this time?” 

134 



“Never fear — it has a temporal 
radius,” Raymond replied. “Fac- 
tory guarantee and all that.” 
“Just to be on the safe side,” 
Martin said, “I think I’d better 
have one of those guns, too.” 

“A splendid idea!” enthused 
Raymond. “I was just about to 
think of that myself!” 

¥¥7" HEN it came time for the 
parting, it was Ninian who 
cried — tears at her own inade- 
quacy, Martin knew, not of sor- 
row. He was getting skillful at 
understanding his descendants, far 
better than they at understanding 
him. But then they never really 
tried. Ninian kissed him wetly on 
the cheek and said she was sure 
everything would work out all 
right and that she’d come see him 
again. She never did, though, ex- 
cept at the very last. 

Raymond and Martin moved 
into a luxurious mansion in a re- 
mote area. The site proved a well- 
chosen one; when the Second 
Atomic War came, half a dozen 
years later, they weren’t touched. 
Martin was never sure whether 
this had been sheer luck or expert 
planning. Probably luck, because 
his descendants were exceedingly 
inept planners. 

Few people in the world then 
could afford to live as stylishly as 
Martin and his guardian. The 
place not only contained every 
possible convenience and gadget 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



but was crammed with bibelots 
and antiques, carefully chosen by 
Raymond and disputed by Mar- 
tin, for, to the man from the fu- 
ture, all available artifacts were 
antiques. Otherwise, Martin ac- 
cepted his new surroundings. His 
sense of wonder had become 
dulled by now and the pink 
pseudo-Spanish castle —“architec- 
turally dreadful, of course,” Ray- 
mond had said, “but so hilari- 
ously typical”— impressed him far 
less than had the suburban split- 
level aquarium. 

“How about a moat?” Martin 
suggested when they first came. 
“It seems to go with a castle.” 

“Do you think a moat could 
stop Conrad?” Raymond asked, 
amused. 

“No,” Martin smiled, feeling 
rather silly, “but it would make 
the place seem safer somehow.” 

The threat of Conrad was be- 
ginning to make him grow more 
and more nervous. He got Ray- 
mond’s permission to take two 
suits of armor that stood in the 
front hall and present them to a 
local museum, because several 
times he fancied he saw them 
move. He also became an adept 
with the ray gun and changed the 
surrounding landscape quite a bit 
with it, until Raymond warned 
that this might lead Conrad to 
them. 

During those early years, Mar- 
tin’s tutors were exchanged for 



the higher-degreed ones that were 
now needful. The question inevi- 
tably arose of what the youth’s 
vocation in that life was going to 
be. At least twenty of the cousins 
came back through time to hold 
one of their vigorous family coun- 
cils. Martin was still young 
enough to enjoy such occasions, 
finding them vastly superior to all 
other forms of entertainment. 

??nPHIS sort of problem 
wouldn’t arise in our day, 
Martin,” Raymond commented as 
he took his place at the head of 
the table, “because, unless one 
specifically feels a call to some 
profession or other, one just — 
well, drifts along happily.” 

“Ours is a wonderful world,” 
Grania sighed at Martin. “I only 
wish we could take you there. I’m 
sure you would like it.” 

“Don’t be a fool, Grania!” Ray- 
mond snapped. “Well, Martin, 
have you made up your mind 
what you want to be?” 

Martin affected to think. “A 
physicist,” he said, not without 
malice. “Or perhaps an engineer.” 
There was a loud, excited 
chorus of dissent. He chuckled in- 
wardly. 

“Can’t do that,” Ives said. 
“Might pick up some concepts 
from us. Don’t know how; none 
of us knows a thing about science. 
But it could happen. Subconscious 
osmosis, if there is such a thing. 



THE MAN OUTSIDE 



135 



That way, you might invent some- 
thing ahead of time. And the fel- 
low we got the plans from par- 
ticularly cautioned us against 
that. Changing history. Danger- 
ous.” 

“Might mess up our time fright- 
fully,” Bartholomew contributed, 
“though, to be perfectly frank, I 
can’t quite understand how.” 

“I am not going to sit down and 
explain the whole thing to you all 
over again, Bart!” Raymond said 
impatiently. “Well, Martin?” 

“What would you suggest?” 
Martin asked. 

“How about becoming a paint- 
er? Art is eternal. And quite gen- 
tlemanly. Besides, artists are al- 
ways expected to be either behind 
or ahead of their times.” 

“Furthermore,” Ottillie added, 
“one more artist couldn’t make 
much difference in history. There 
were so many of them all through 
the ages.” 

Martin couldn’t hold back his 
question. “What was I, actually, 
in that other time?” 

There was a chilly silence. 

“Let’s not talk about it, dear,” 
Lalage finally said. “Let’s just be 
thankful we’ve saved you from 
that!” 

So drawing teachers were en- 
gaged and Martin became a very 
competent second-rate artist. He 
knew he would never be able to 
achieve first rank because, even 
though he was still so young, his 

136 



work was almost purely intellec- 
tual. The only emotion he seemed 
able to feel was fear — the ever- 
present fear that someday he 
would turn a corridor and walk 
into a man who looked like him 
— a man who wanted to kill him 
for the sake of an ideal. 

But the fear did not show in 
Martin’s pictures. They were 
pretty pictures. 

Z'' 1 OUSIN Ives — now that Mar- 
tin was older, he was told to 
call the descendants cousin — next 
assumed guardianship. Ives took 
his responsibilities more seriously 
than the others did. He even ar- 
ranged to have Martin’s work 
shown at an art gallery. The 
paintings received critical ap- 
proval, but failed to evoke any 
enthusiasm. The modest sale they 
enjoyed was mostly to interior 
decorators. Museums were not in- 
terested. 

“Takes time,” Ives tried to re- 
assure him. “One day they’ll be 
buying your pictures, Martin. 
Wait and see.” 

Ives was the only one of the 
descendants who seemed to think 
of Martin as an individual. When 
his efforts to make contact with 
the other young man failed, he 
got worried and decided that 
what Martin needed was a change 
of air and scenery. 

“ ’Course you can’t go on the 
Grand Tour. Your son hasn’t in- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




vented space travel yet. But we 
can go see this world. What’s left 
of it. Tourists always like ruins 
best, anyway.” 

So he drew on the family’s vast 
future resources and bought a 
yacht, which Martin christened 
The Interregnum. They traveled 
about from sea to ocean and from 
ocean to sea, touching at various 
ports and making trips inland. 
Martin saw the civilized world — 
mostly in fragments; the nearly 
intact semi-civilized world and 
the uncivilized world, much the 
same as it had been for centuries. 
It was like visiting an enormous 
museum; he couldn’t seem to 
identify with his own time any 
more. 

The other cousins appeared to 
find the yacht a congenial head- 
quarters, largely because they 
could spend so much time far 
away from the contemporary in- 
habitants of the planet and relax 
and be themselves. So they never 
moved back to land. Martin spent 
the rest of his life on The Inter- 
regnum. He felt curiously safer 
from Conrad there, although 
there was no valid reason why an 
ocean should stop a traveler 
through time. 

More cousins were in residence 
at once than ever before, because 
they came for the ocean voyage. 
They spent most of their time 
aboard ship, giving each other 
parties and playing an avant- 



THE MAN OUTSIDE 



137 



garde form of shuffleboard and 
gambling on future sporting 
events. That last usually ended in 
a brawl, because one cousin was 
sure to accuse another of having 
got advance information about 
the results. 

Martin didn’t care much for 
their company and associated 
with them only when not to have 
done so would have been palp- 
ably rude. And, though they were 
gregarious young people for the 
most part, they didn’t court his 
society. He suspected that he 
made them feel uncomfortable. 

IT E RATHER liked Ives, 
though. Sometimes the two 
of them would be alone together; 
then Ives would tell Martin of 
the future world he had come 
from. The picture drawn by Ray- 
mond and Ninian had not been 
entirely accurate, Ives admitted. 
True, there was no war or pov- 
erty on Earth proper, but that 
was because there were only a 
couple of million people left on 
the planet. It was an enclave for 
the highly privileged, highly 
interbred aristocracy, to which 
Martin’s descendants belonged by 
virtue of their distinguished an- 
cestry. 

“Rather feudal, isn’t it?” Mar- 
tin asked. 

Ives agreed, adding that the 
system had, however, been delib- 
erately planned, rather than the 



result of haphazard natural devel- 
opment. Everything potentially 
unpleasant, like the mercantiles, 
had been deported. 

“Not only natives livin’ on the 
other worlds,” Ives said as the 
two of them stood at the ship’s 
rail, surrounded by the limitless 
expanse of some ocean or other. 
“People, too. Mostly lower classes, 
except for officials and things. 
With wars and want and suffer- 
ing,” he added regretfully, “same 
as in your day . Like now, I 
mean,” he corrected himself. 
“Maybe it is worse, the way Con- 
rad thinks. More planets for us to 
make trouble on. Three that were 
habitable aren’t any more. 
Bombed. Very thorough job.” 

“Oh,” Martin murmured, trying 
to sound shocked, horrified — in- 
terested, even. 

“Sometimes I’m not altogether 
sure Conrad was wrong,” Ives 
said, after a pause. “Tried to keep 
us from getting to the stars, hurt- 
ing the people — I expect you 
could call them people — there. 
Still — ” he smiled shamefacedly — 
“couldn’t stand by and see my 
own way of life destroyed, could 
I?” 

“I suppose not,” Martin said. 

“Would take moral courage. I 
don’t have it. None of us does, ex- 
cept Conrad, and even he—” Ives 
looked out over the sea. “Must be 
a better way out than Conrad’s,” 
he said without conviction. “And

everything will work out all right 
in the end. Bound to. No sense to 
— to anything, if it doesn’t.” He 
glanced wistfully at Martin. 

“I hope so,” said Martin. But 
he couldn’t hope; he couldn’t feel; 
he couldn’t even seem to care. 

During all this time, Conrad 
still did not put in an appearance. 
Martin had gotten to be such a 
crack shot with the ray pistol that 
he almost wished his descendant 
would show up, so there would be 
some excitement. But he didn’t 
come. And Martin got to think- 
ing .. 

He always felt that if any of 
the cousins could have come to 
realize the basic flaw in the elabo- 
rate plan they had concocted, it 
would have been Ives. However, 
when the yacht touched at Tierra 
del Fuego one bitter winter, Ives 
took a severe chill. They sent for 
a doctor from the future — one of 
the descendants who had been ec- 
centric enough to take a medical 
degree — but he wasn’t able to 
save Ives. The body was buried 
in the frozen ground at Ushuaia, 
on the southern tip of the conti- 
nent, a hundred years or more be- 
fore the date of his birth. 

A great many of the cousins 
turned up at the simple cere- 
mony. All were dressed in over- 
whelming black and showed a 
great deal of grief. Raymond read 
the burial service, because they 
didn’t dare summon a clerical 



cousin from the future; they were 
afraid he might prove rather 
stuffy about the entire undertak- 
ing. 

“He died for all of us,” Ray- 
mond concluded his funeral eu- 
logy over Ives, “so his death was 
not in vain.” 

But Martin disagreed. 

r I ’HE ceaseless voyaging began 
again. The Interregnum voy- 
aged to every ocean and every 
sea. Some were blue and some 
green and some dun. After a 
while, Martin couldn’t tell one 
from another. Cousin after cousin 
came to watch over him and 
eventually they were as hard for 
him to tell apart as the different 
oceans. 

All the cousins were young, for, 
though they came at different 
times in his life, they had all 
started out from the same time in 
theirs. Only the young ones had 
been included in the venture; 
they did not trust their elders. 

As the years went by, Martin 
began to lose even his detached 
interest in the land and its do- 
ings. Although the yacht fre- 
quently touched port for fuel or 
supplies — it was more economi- 
cal to purchase them in that era 
than to have them shipped from 
the future— he Seldom went 
ashore, and then only at the urg- 
ing of a newly assigned cousin 
anxious to see the sights. Most of

the time Martin spent in watch- 
ing the sea — and sometimes he 
painted it. There seemed to be a 
depth to his seascapes that his 
other work lacked. 

When he was pressed by the 
current cousin to make a land 
visit somewhere, he decided to 
exhibit a few of his sea paintings. 
That way, he could fool himself 
into thinking that there was some 
purpose to this journey. He’d 
come to believe that perhaps 
what his life lacked was purpose, 
and for a while he kept looking 
for meaning everywhere, to the 
cousin’s utter disgust. 

“Eat, drink and be merry, or 
whatever you Romans say when 
you do as you do,” the cousin— 
who was rather woolly in history; 
the descendants were scraping 
bottom now — advised. 

Martin showed his work in 
Italy, so that the cousin could be 
disillusioned by the current crop 
of Romans. He found that neither 
purpose nor malice was enough; 
he was still immeasurably bored. 
However, a museum bought two 
of the paintings. Martin thought 
of Ives and felt an uncomfortable 
pang of a sensation he could no 
longer understand. 

“Where do you suppose Conrad 
has been all this time?” Martin 
idly asked the current cousin — 
who was passing as his nephew 
by now. 

The young man jumped, then 



glanced around him uncomfort- 
ably. “Conrad’s a very shrewd 
fellow,” he whispered. “He’s bid- 
ing his time — waiting until we’re 
off guard. And then — pow! — he’ll 
attack!” 

“Oh, I see,” Martin said. 

He had often fancied that Con- 
rad would prove to be the most 
stimulating member of the whole 
generation. But it seemed un- 
likely that he would ever have a 
chance for a conversation with 
the young man. More than one 
conversation, anyhow. 

“When he does show up, I’ll 
protect you,” the cousin vowed, 
touching his ray gun. “You haven’t 
a thing to worry about.” 

Martin smiled with all the 
charm he’d had nothing to do but 
acquire. “I have every confidence 
in you,” he told his descendant. 
He himself had given up carrying 
a gun long ago. 

There was a war in the North- 
ern Hemisphere and so The In- 
terregnum voyaged to southern 
waters. There was a war in the 
south and they hid out in the 
Arctic. All the nations became too 
drained of power — fuel and man 
and will — to fight, so there was a 
sterile peace for a long time. The 
Interregnum roamed the seas rest- 
lessly, with her load of passengers 
from the future, plus one bored 
and aging contemporary. She 
bore big guns now, because of the 
ever-present danger of pirates.

TJERHAPS it was the tradition- 
ally bracing effect of sea air — 
perhaps it was the sheltered life 
— but Martin lived to be a very 
old man. He was a hundred and 
four when his last illness came. It 
was a great relief when the family 
doctor, called in again from the 
future, said there was no hope. 
Martin didn’t think he could have 
borne another year of life. 

All the cousins gathered at the 
yacht to pay their last respects to 
their progenitor. He saw Ninian 
again, after all these years, and 
Raymond — all the others, dozens 
of them, thronging around his 
bed, spilling out of the cabin and 
into the passageways and out 
onto the deck, making their usual 
clamor, even though their voices 
were hushed. 

Only Ives was missing. He’d 
been the lucky one, Martin knew. 
He had been spared the tragedy 
that was going to befall these 
blooming young people — all the 
same age as when Martin had last 
seen them and doomed never to 
grow any older. Underneath their 
masks of woe, he could see relief 
at the thought that at last they 
were going to be rid of their re- 
sponsibility. And underneath 
Martin’s death mask lay an im- 
personal pity for those poor, stu- 
pid descendants of his who had 
blundered so irretrievably. 

There was only one face which 
Martin had never seen before. It 



wasn’t a strange face, however, 
because Martin had seen one 
very like it in the looking glass 
when he was a young man. 

“You must be Conrad,” Martin 
called across the cabin in a voice 
that was still clear. “I’ve been 
looking forward to meeting you 
for some time.” 

The other cousins whirled to 
face the newcomer. 

“You’re too late, Con,” Ray- 
mond gloated for the whole gen- 
eration. “He’s lived out his life.” 

“But he hasn’t lived out his 
life,” Conrad contradicted. “He’s 
lived out the life you created for 
him. And for yourselves, too.” 

For the first time, Martin saw 
compassion in the eyes of one of 
his lineage and found it vaguely 
disturbing. It didn’t seem to be- 
long there. 

“Don’t you realize even yet,” 
Conrad went on, “that as soon as 
he goes, you’ll go, too — present, 
past, future, wherever you are, 
you’ll go up in the air like puffs 
of smoke?” 

“What do you mean?” Ninian 
quavered, her soft, pretty face 
alarmed. 

Martin answered Conrad’s rue- 
ful smile, but left the explana- 
tions up to him. It was his show, 
after all. 

“Because you will never have 
existed,” Conrad said. “You have 
no right to existence; it was you 
yourselves who watched him all

the time, so he didn’t have a 
chance to lead a normal life, get 
married, have children . .” 

"IVT OST of the cousins gasped as 
the truth began to perco- 
late through. 

“I knew from the very begin- 
ning,” Conrad finished, “that I 
didn’t have to do anything at all. 
I just had to wait and you would 
destroy yourselves.” 

“I don’t understand,” Bartholo- 
mew protested, searching the faces 
of the cousins closest to him. 
“What does he mean, we have 



never existed? We’re here, aren’t 
we? What — ” 

“Shut up!” Raymond snapped. 
He turned on Martin. “You don’t 
seem surprised.” 

The old man grinned. “I’m not. 
I figured it all out years ago.” 

At first, he had wondered what 
he should do. Would it be better 
to throw them into a futile panic 
by telling them or to do nothing? 
He had decided on the latter; that 
was the role they had assigned 
him— to watch and wait and keep 
out of things — and that was the 
role he would play.

“You knew all the time and 
you didn’t tell us!” Raymond 
spluttered. “After we’d been so 
good to you, making a gentleman 
out of you instead of a criminal 
. That’s right,” he snarled, “a 
criminal! An alcoholic, a thief, a 
derelict! How do you like that?” 
“Sounds like a rich, full life,” 
Martin said wistfully. 

What an exciting existence they 
must have done him out of! But 
then, he couldn’t help thinking, 
he — he and Conrad together, of 
course — had done them out of 
any kind of existence. It wasn’t 



his responsibility, though; he had 
done nothing but let matters take 
whatever course was destined for 
them. If only he could be sure 
that it was the better course, per- 
haps he wouldn’t feel that nag- 
ging sense of guilt inside him. 
Strange — where, in his hermetic 
life, could be possibly have devel- 
oped such a queer thing as a con- 
science? 

“Then we’ve wasted all this 
time,” Ninian sobbed, “all this 
energy, all this money, for noth- 
ing!” 

“But you were nothing to begin

with,” Martin told them. And 
then, after a pause, he added, “I 
only wish I could be sure there 
had been some purpose to this.” 

He didn’t know whether it was 
approaching death that dimmed 
his sight, or whether the fright- 
ened crowd that pressed around 
him was growing shadowy. 

“I wish I could feel that some 
good had been done in letting you 
be wiped out of existence,” he 
went on voicing his thoughts. 
“But I know that the same thing 
that happened to your worlds 
and my world will happen all 
over again. To other people, in 
other times, but again. It’s bound 
to happen. There isn’t any hope 
for humanity.” 

One man couldn’t really change 
the course of human history, he 
told himself. Two men, that was 

— one real, one a shadow. 

Conrad came close to the old 

man’s bed. He was almost trans- 
parent. 

“No,” he said, “there is hope. 
They didn’t know the time trans- 
mitter works two ways. I used it 
for going into the past only once 

— just this once. But I’ve gone 
into the future with it many 
times. And — ” he pressed Martin’s 
hand —“believe me, what I did — 
what we did, you and I — serves a 
purpose. It will change things for 
the better. Everything is going to 
be all right.” 



W AS Conrad telling him the 
truth, Martin wondered, or 
was he just giving the conven- 
tional reassurance to the dying? 
More than that, was he trying to 
convince himself that what he 
had done was the right thing? 
Every cousin had assured Martin 
that things were going to be all 
right. 

Was Conrad actually different 
from the rest? 

His plan had worked and the 
others’ hadn’t, but then all his 
plan had consisted of was doing 
nothing. That was all he and Mar- 
tin had done . nothing. Were 
they absolved of all responsibility 
merely because they had stood 
aside and taken advantage of the 
others’ weaknesses? 

“Why,” Martin said to himself, 
“in a sense, it could be said that I 
have fulfilled my original destiny 
— that I am a criminal.” 

Well, it didn’t matter; whatever 
happened, no one could hold him 
to blame. He held no stake in the 
future that was to come. It was 
other men’s future — other men’s 
problem. He died very peacefully 
then, and, since he was the only 
one left on the ship, there was no- 
body to bury him. 

The unmanned yacht drifted 
about the seas for years and gave 
rise to many legends, none of 
them as unbelievable as the truth.
