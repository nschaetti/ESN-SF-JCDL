RECONNAISSANCE SHIP — This specially designed "flying laboratory" is 
equipped for research and living so that scientists, away from the home 
base for long periods of time, can make prolonged and intimate inspection 
of the Moon's surface. The ship's equipment includes radar, solar reflectors, 
radio, astrodome top, two huge fuel tanks, electronic instruments, computers, 
chemical laboratory and other exploration necessities, as well as health 
and comfort facilities. Now turn to inside back cover.

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

MOST OF the “chatting 55 this issue 
comes in the form of an interesting 
letter received from Mrs. Alma 
McCormick, of Richland, Wash- 
ington, who takes slight issue with 
The Golden Man , by Philip K. 
Dick, which appeared in the April 
issue. Mrs. McCormick enjoyed the 
story but disagrees with the mutant 
theme. We enjoyed her letter, and 
think you will too. 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

Your Chat With the Editor in 
April IF is thoroughly enjoyable. 
But I have another theme to sug- 
gest: the theme that homo superior , 
the mutants, will be and must be 
hunted out and destroyed by homo 
sapiens when and if he ever occurs. 

1 admit that “The Golden Man 55 by 
Dick doesn’t deal with homo su- 
perior as much as it does with 
“horrible tribes of mutant freaks 55 
who might justifiably be a source of 
horror and terror. But the last para- 

2 


graph, page 17, takes the same 
stand that was taken in the book 
“Dragon Island 55 (and countless 
other stories) : 

“Which race? Not the human 
race. .' . If we introduce a mutant 
to keep us going, it’ll be mutants, 
not us, who’ll inherit the earth. 
It’ll be mutants surviving for their 
own sake. To survive, we’ve got 
to cold-deck them right from the 
start.” 

Now, really! 

I’m a teacher ... of exceptional 
children. This semester they are 
mentally retarded children, as far 
below the abilities of normal chil- 
dren as homo sapiens would be be- 
low homo superior. They cannot 
and never will be able to take care 
of themselves, but we carefully 
teach them all they can learn (very 
simple reading, social graces, 
grooming, use of household and 
play equipment, counting and use 
of coins). We don’t, and never ex- 
pect the rest of the world to, com- 
pete with them. They’re certainly 
not being “cold-decked 55 from the 
start. 

On the other hand, I have taught 
superior children. Not superior to 
the extent of homo superior, true. 
I did have one “gifted class” how- 
ever that had an average I.Q. of 
128. If I remember correctly, the 
highest 3 or 4 members rated be- 
tween 140 I.Q. and 167 I.Q. — rat- 
ings that occur in a very, very thin 
“cream” on top of the general 
population. The 167 I.Q. rating oc- 
curs about 3 times in 10,000 chil- 
dren if we can trust statistics. 

And what were they like? And 
how did the schools and the gen- 
eral population treat them? Well, 

A CHAT WITH THE EDITOR 



they were a joy to teach and some- 
times a bit difficult to handle. All 
of them spoke two languages (Eng- 
glish and Spanish) and had learned 
to speak Spanish fluently and rea- 
sonably correctly in six weeks. Many 
also spoke from one to three more 
languages. (They were children of 
diplomats and industrialists and 
had travelled extensively.) They 
learned everything else as rapidly 
as they learned languages, and the 
few merely average children, who 
learned at merely average rates, not 
only enjoyed the pyrotechnics of 
some of their discussions but 
seemed to catch fire from them to 
do better work of their own. For 
example, have you ever seen the 
trouble teachers of average high 
school classes (or even college 
classes) have when they try to get 
students to “document” papers they 
write or ideas they propound by 
sufficient reading even when the 
teachers give a bibliography already 
prepared? These 8 to 9 year old 
children would discuss a new item 
of knowledge or a new idea, and 
the next day a good many of them 
would come to class with armloads 
of books from the library with para- 
graphs, chapters, or full-time treat- 
ment of the subject. At first it was 
only the brighter ones; later even 
the few merely average were do- 
ing the same thing. 

Such children are not only a joy 
(though I know some teachers 
loathe working with “precocious 
brats”) ; they seem to be a lift to 
others. Except in one situation : 
when you have one exceedingly 
brilliant child in an average class 
or school, you have a bored, con- 
ceited, self-centered, isolated, re-

bellious, bothersome pest. One mu- 
tant, one homo superior might be 
like that. 

But from my experience with the 
superior child, and from the kudos 
our world hands such men as Ein- 
stein, Oppenheimer, etc., I think 
we would merely be more im- 
pressed and even happier with a 
truly new race, a truly superior 
race. They might not be highly im- 
pressed with us, but even now we 
have our intelligentsia who associate 
mostly with each other, our aver- 
age who associate with the average, 
and the dull who are happy with 
the dull . and even our way- 
down-below-average like my little 
ones who are happy as larks when 
they are with each other. Brains 
seek their own level. 

Rather than Cro Magnon kill- 
ing off all the Neanderthal, isn’t it 
possible that their taking over was 
a matter of natural selection plus 
absorption? If mutants arrived, it 
seems more likely (to me) that 
homo sapiens would be absorbed 
gradually (many a genius marries a 
mere average spouse) ; if homo su- 
perior bred true, his more resistant 
body could probably stand the dis- 
ease and injuries the world hands 
out better and his children would 
inherit the earth. If present man- 
kind died out, I doubt that it would 
be in gas chambers or crematori- 
ums, and those of us who lived out 
a full life-time (as the Neander- 
thals perhaps did) would live it ad- 
miring and accepting the leader- 
ship of the superior race because 
they’d make our lives richer and 
fuller too. 

Sincerely yours, 
(Mrs.) Alma McCormick

The scientists of Rykeman III were conceded by all the galactic 
members to be supreme in scientific achievement. Now the 
Rykes were going to share their vast knowledge with the scien- 
tists of Earth. T o any question they would supply an answer — 
for a price. And Hockley, of all Earth’s scientists, was the stub- 
born one who wanted to weigh the answers with the costs . 

THE 

UNLEARNED 

By Raymond F. Jones

T HE CHIEF Officer of Scien- 
tific Services, Information and 
Coordination was a somewhat mis- 
leading and obscure title, and Dr. 
Sherman Hockley who held it was 
not the least of those whom the 
title misled and sometimes ob- 
scured. 

He told himself he was not a 
mere library administrator, al- 
though he was proud of the infor- 
mation files built up under his di- 
rection. They contained the essence 
of accumulated knowledge found 
to date on Earth and the extra- 
terrestrial planets so far contacted. 
He didn’t feel justified in claiming 
to be strictly a research supervisor, 
either, in spite of duties as top level 
administrator for all divisions of 
the National Standardization and 
Research Laboratories and their 


subsidiaries in government, indus- 
try, and education. During his term 
of supervision the National Lab- 
oratories had made a tremendous 
growth, in contrast to a previous 
decline. 

Most of all, however, he dis- 
claimed being a figurehead, to 
which all the loose strings of a vast 
and rambling organization could be 
tied. But sometimes it was quite 
difficult to know whether or not 
that was his primary assignment 
after all. His unrelenting efforts to 
keep out of the category seemed to 
be encountering more and more 
determination to push him in that 
direction. 

Of course, this was merely the 
way it looked in his more bitter 
moments — such as the present. 
Normally, he had a full awareness 



of the paramount importance of 
his position, and was determined to 
administer it on a scale in keeping 
with that importance. His decision 
could affect the research in the 
world’s major laboratories. Not 
that he was a dictator by any 
means, although there were times 
when dictation was called for. As 
when a dozen projects needed 
money and the Congress allotted 
enough for one or two. Somebody 
had to make a choice — 

His major difficulty was that ac- 
tive researchers knew it was the 
Congressional Science Committee 
which was, ultimately responsible 
for their bread and butter. And the 
Senators regarded the scientists, 
who did the actual work in the lab- 
oratories, as the only ones who mat- 
tered. Both groups tended to look 
upon Hockley’s office as a sort of 
fulcrum in their efforts to main- 
tain balance with each other — or as 
referee in their sparring for ade- 
quate control over each other. 

At that, however, things re- 
searchwise were better than ever 
before. More funds and facilities 
were available. Positions in pure 
research were more secure. 

And then, once again, rumors 
about Rykeman III had begun to 
circulate wildly a few days ago. 

Since Man’s achievement of ex- 
tra-galactic flight, stories of Ryke- 
man III had. tantalized the world 
and made research scientists sick 
with longing when they considered 
the possible truth of what they 
heard. The planet was rumored to 
be a world of super-science, whose 
people had an answer for every re- 
search problem a man could con- 
ceive. The very few Earthmen 


who had been to Rykeman III con- 
firmed the rumors. It was a para- 
dise, according to their stories. And 
among other peoples of the galaxies 
the inhabitants of Rykeman III 
were acknowledged supreme in 
scientific achievement. None chal- 
lenged them. None even ap- 
proached them in abilities. 

What made the situation so frus- 
trating to Earthmen was the addi- 
tional report that the Rykes were 
quite altruistically sharing their 
science with a considerable number 
of other worlds on a fee basis. 
Earth scientists became intoxicated 
at the mere thought of studying at 
the feet of the exalted Rykes. 

Except Dr. Sherman Hockley. 
From the first he had taken a dim 
view of the Ryke reports. Consid- 
ering the accomplishments of the 
National Laboratories, he could see 
no reason for his colleagues’ half- 
shameful disowning of all their own 
work in favor of a completely un- 
known culture several hundred mil- 
lion light years away. They were 
bound to contact more advanced 
cultures in their explorations — and 
could be thankful they were as al- 
truistic as the Rykes! — but it was 
no reason to view themselves as 
idiot children hoping to be taught 
by the Rykes. 

He had kept his opinions very 
much to himself in the past, since 
they were not popular with his asso- 
ciates, who generally regarded his 
attitudes as simply old-fashioned. 
But now, for the first time, a Ryke 
ship was honoring Earth with a 
visit. There was almost hysterical 
speculation over the possibility that 
Earth would be offered tutelage by 
the mighty Ryke scientists. Hockley

wouldn’t hhve said he was unalter- 
ably opposed to the idea. He would 
have described himself as extreme- 
ly cautious. What he did oppose 
wholeheartedly was the enthusiasm 
that painted the Rykes with pure 
and shining light, without a shad- 
owy hue in the whole picture. 

Since his arrival, the Ryke envoy 
had been closeted with members of 
the Congressional Science Commit- 
tee. Not a word had leaked as to 
his message. Shortly, however, the 
scientists were to be let in on the 
secret which might affect their ca- 
reers for better or for worse during 
the rest of their lives, and for many 
generations to come. The meeting 
was going to be — 

Hockley jumped to his feet as 
he glanced at the clock. He hurried 
through the door to the office of 
his secretary, Miss Cardston, who 
looked meaningfully at him as he 
passed. 

‘Til bet there isn’t a Senator on 
time,” he said. 

In the corridor he almost col- 
lided with Dr. Lester Showalter, 
who was his Administrative Assist- 
ant for Basic Research. “The Ryke 
character showed up fifteen min- 
utes ago,” said Showalter. “Every- 
one’s waiting.” 

“We’ve got six minutes yet,” said 
Hockley. He walked rapidly beside 
Showalter. “Is there any word on 
what the envoy’s got that’s so im- 
portant?” 

“No. I’ve got the feeling it’s 
something pretty big. Wheeler and 
Johnson of Budget are there. Some- 
body said it might have something 
to do with the National Lab.” 

“I don’t see the connection be- 
tween that and a meeting with the 

THE UNLEARNED 


Ryke,” said Hockley. 

Showalter stopped at the door 
of the conference room. “Maybe 
they want to sell us something. At 
any rate, we’re about to find out.” 
The conference table was sur- 
rounded by Senators of the Com- 
mittee. Layered behind them were 
scientists representing the cream of 
Hockley’s organization. Senator 
Markham, the bulky, red-faced 
Chairman greeted them. “Your 
seats are reserved at the head of 
the table,” he said. 

“Sorry about the time,” Hockley 
mumbled. “Clock must be slow.” 
“Quite all right. We assembled 
just a trifle early. I want you to 
meet our visitor, Special Envoy 
from Rykeman III, Liacan.” 
Markham introduced them, and 
the stick-thin envoy arose with an 
extended hand. His frail, whistling 
voice that was in keeping with his 
bird-like character spoke in clear 
tones. “I am happy to know you. 
Dr. Hockley, Dr. Showalter.” 

The two men sat down in good 
view of the visitor’s profile. Hock- 
ley had seen the Rykes before, but 
had always been repelled by their 
snobbish approach. Characteristi- 
cally, the envoy bore roughly an- 
thropomorphic features, including 
a short feather covering on his 
dorsal side. He was dressed in 
bright clothing that left visible the 
streak of feathering that descended 
from the bright, plumed crown and 
along the back of his neck. Gravity 
and air pressure of Earth were 
about normal forliim. For breath- 
ing, however, he was required to 
wear a small device in one narrow 
nostril. This was connected to a 
compact tank on his shoulder.

Markham called for order and 
introduced the visitor. There was a 
round of applause. Liacan bowed 
with a short, stiff gesture and let his 
small black eyes dart over the audi- 
ence. With an adjustment of his 
breathing piece he began speaking. 

“It is recognized on Earth/’ he 
said, “as it is elsewhere, that my 
people of Rykeman III possess un- 
disputed intellectual leadership in 
the galaxies of the Council. Your 
research is concerned with things 
taugfit only in the kindergartens of 
my world. Much that you hold to 
be true is in error, and your most 
profound discoveries are self-evi- 
dent to the children of my people.” 

Hockley felt a quick, painful con- 
traction in the region of his dia- 
phragm. So this was it! 

“We are regarded with much 
jealousy, envy, and even hatred by 
some of our unlearned neighbors 
in space,” said the Ryke. “But it 
has never been our desire to be 
selfish with our superior achieve-* 
ments which make us the object 
of these feelings. We have under- 
taken a program of scientific lead- 
ership in our interstellar neighbor- 
hood. This began long before you 
came into space and many worlds 
have accepted the plan we offer. 

“Obviously, it is impractical to 
pour out all the knowledge and 
basic science we have accumulated. 
Another world would find it im- 
possible to sort out that which was 
applicable to it. What we do is act 
as a consultation center upon which 
others can call at will to obtain 
data pertaining to any problem at 
hand. Thus, they are not required 
to sort through wholly inapplic- 
able information to find what they 

8 


need. 

“For example, if you desire to 
improve your surface conveyances, 
we will supply you with data for 
building an optimum vehicle suit- 
able for conditions on Earth and 
which is virtually indestructible. 
You will of course do your own 
manufacturing, but even there we 
can supply you with technology that 
will make the process seem miracu- 
lous by your present standards. 

“Our services are offered for a 
fee, payable in suitable items of 
goods or raw materials. When you 
contemplate the freedom from 
monotonous and unending research 
in fields already explored by us, I 
am certain you will not consider 
our fees exorbitant. Our desire is to 
raise the cultural level of all peo- 
ples to the maximum of which they 
are capable. We know it is not pos- 
sible or even desirable to bring 
others to our own high levels, but 
we do offer assistance to all cultures 
in accord with their ability to re- 
ceive. The basic principle is that 
they shall ask — and whatever is 
asked for, with intelligence suffi- 
cient for its utilization, that shall be 
granted. 

“I am certain I may count on 
your acceptance of the generous 
offer of my people.” 

The envoy sat down with a jig- 
gling of his bright plume, and there 
was absolute silence in the room. 
Hockley pictured to himself the 
dusty, cobweb laboratories of Earth 
vacated by scientists who ran to the 
phone to call the Rykes for answers 
to every problem. 

Senator Markham stood up and 
glanced over the audience. “There 
is the essence of the program which 

RAYMOND F. JONES 



has been submitted to us,” he said. 
“There is a vast amount of detail 
which is, of course, obvious to the 
minds of our friends on Rykeman 
III, but which must be the subject 
of much deliberation on the part of 
us comparatively simple minded 
Earthmen.” He gave a self-con- 
scious chuckle, which got no 
response. 

Hockley felt mentally stunned. 
Here at last was the thing that had 
been hoped for by most, anxiously 
awaited by a few, and opposed by 
almost no one. 

“The major difficulty , 55 said 
Markham with slow dignity, “is the 
price. It’s high, yes. In monetary 
terms, approximately twelve and a 
half billions per year. But certainly 
no man in his right mind would 
consider any reasonable figure too 
high for what we can expect to re- 
ceive from our friends of Rykeman 
HL 

“We of the Science Committee 
do not believe, however, that we 
could get a commitment for this 
sum to be added to our normal bud- 
get. Yet there is a rather obvious 
solution. The sum required is very 
close to that which is now expended 
on the National Standardization 
and Research Laboratories . 55 

Hockley felt a sudden chill at the 
back of his neck. 

“With the assistance of the 
Rykes , 55 said Markham, “we shall 
have no further need of the Nation- 
al Laboratories. We shall require 
but a small staff to analyze our 
problems and present them to the 
Rykes and relay the answers for 
proper assimilation. Acceptance of 
the Ryke program provides its own 
automatic financing l 55 

THE UNLEARNED 


He glanced about with a tri- 
umphant smile. Hockley felt as if 
he were looking through a mist 
upon something that happened a 
long time ago. The National Lab! 
Abandon the National Lab! 

Around him there were small 
nods of agreement from his col- 
leagues. Some pursed their lips as 
if doubtful — but not very much. He 
waited for someone to rise to his 
feet in a blast of protest. No one 
did. For a moment Hockley’s own 
hands tensed on the back of the 
chair in front of him. Then he 
slumped back to his seat. Now was 
not the time. 

They had to thrash it out among 
themselves. He had to show them 
the magnitude of this bribe. He had 
to find an argument to beat down 
the Congressmen’s irrational hopes 
of paradise. He couldn’t plead for 
the Lab on the grounds of senti- 
ment — or that it was sometimes a 
good idea to work out your own 
problems. The Senators didn’t care 
for the problems or concerns of the 
scientists. It appeared that even the 
scientists themselves had forgotten 
to care. He had to slug both groups 
with something very solid. 

Markham was going on. “We are 
convinced this is a bargain which 
even the most obstinate of our Con- 
gressional colleagues will be quick 
to recognize. It would be folly to 
compute with building blocks when 
we can gain access to giant calcula- 
tors. There should be no real diffi- 
culty in getting funds transferred 
from the National Laboratory. 

“At this time we will adjourn. 
Liacan leaves this evening. Our ac- 
ceptance of this generous offer will 
be conveyed to Rykeman III direct- 


9 



ly upon official sanction by the Con- 
gress. I wish to ask this same group 
to meet again for discussion of the 
details incident to this transfer of 
operations. Let us say at ten o’clock 
in the morning, gentlemen.” 

H OCKLEY said goodbye to the 
envoy. Afterwards, he moved 
through the circle of Senators to his 
own group. In the corridor they 
tightened about him and followed 
along as if he had given an order 
for them to follow him. He turned 
and attempted a grin. 

“Looks like a bull session is in 
order, gents. Assembly in five min- 
utes in my office.” 

As he and Showalter opened the 
door to Miss Cardston’s office and 
strode in, the secretary looked up 
with a start. “I thought you were 
going to meet in the conference 
room.” 

“We’ve met,” said Hockley. 
“This is the aftermeeting. Send out 
for a couple of cases of beer.” He 
glanced at the number surging 
through the doorway and fished in 
his billfold. “Better make it three. 
This ought to cover it.” 

With disapproval, Miss Cardston 
picked up the bills and turned to 
the phone. Almost simultaneously 
there was a bellow of protest and an 
enormous, ham-like hand gripped 
her slender wrist. She glanced up 
in momentary fright. 

Dr. Forman K. Silvers was hold- 
ing her wrist with one hand and 
clapping Hockley on the back with 
the other. “This is not an occasion 
for beer, my boy!” he said in an 
enormous voice. “Make that a case 
of champagne, Miss Cardston.” He 

10 


released her and drew out his own 
billfold. 

“Get somebody to bring in a cou- 
ple of dozen chairs,” Hockley said. 

In his own office he walked to the 
window behind his desk and stood 
facing it. The afternoon haze was 
coming up out of the ocean. Faintly 
visible were the great buildings of 
the National Laboratories on the 
other side of the city. Above the 
mist the sun caught the tip of the 
eight story tower where the massive 
field tunnels of the newly designed 
gamma tron were to be installed. 

Or were to have been installed. 

The gammatron was expected to 
make possible the creation of gravi- 
tational fields up to five thousand 
g’s. It would probably be a mere 
toy to the Rykes, but Hockley felt a 
fierce pride in its creation. Maybe 
that was childish. Maybe his whole 
feeling about the Lab was childish. 
Perhaps the time had come to give 
up childish things and take upon 
themselves adulthood. 

But looking across the city at the 
concrete spire of the gammatron, 
he didn’t believe it. 

He heard the clank of metal 
chairs as a couple of clerks began 
bringing them in. Then there was 
the clink of glassware. He turned to 
see Miss Cardston stiffly indicating 
a spot on the library table for the 
glasses and the frosty bottles. 

Hockley walked slowly to the 
table and filled one of the glasses. 
He raised it slowly. “It’s been a 
short life but a merry one, gentle- 
men.” He swallowed the contents of 
the glass too quickly and returned 
to his desk. 

“You don’t sound very happy 
about the whole thing,” said Mor- 

RAYMOND F. JONES 



tenson, a chemist who wore a neat, 
silvery mustache. 

“Are you overjoyed,” said Hock- 
ley, “that we are to swap the Na- 
tional Lab for a bottomless encyclo- 
pedia?” 

“Yes, I think so,” said Morten- 
son. “There are some minor objec- 
tions, but in the end I’m certain 
we’ll all be satisfied with what we 
get . 55 

“Satisfied! Happy!” exclaimed 
the mathematician, Dr. Silvers. 
“How can you use words so prosaic 
and restrained in references to these 
great events which we shall be 
privileged to witness in our life- 
times?” 

He had taken his stand by the 
library table and was now filling 
the glasses with the clear, bubbling 
champagne, sloshing it with ecstatic 
abandon over the table and the rug. 

Hockley glanced toward him. 
“You don’t believe, then. Dr. Sil- 
vers, that we should maintain any 
reserve in regard to the Rykes?” 

“None whatever! The gods them- 
selves have stepped down and of- 
fered an invitation direct to para- 
dise. Should we question or hold 
back, or say we are merely happy. 
The proper response of a man 
about to enter heaven is beyond 
words!” 

The bombast of the mathema- 
tician never failed to enliven any 
backroom session in which he par- 
ticipated. “I have no doubt,” he 
said, “that within a fortnight we 
shall be in possession of a solution 
to the Legrandian Equations. I 
have sought this for forty years.” 

“I think it would be a mistake to 
support the closing of the National 
Laboratories,” said Hockley slowly. 

THE UNLEARNED 


As if a switch had been thrown, 
their expressions changed. There 
was a sudden carefulness in their 
stance and movements, as if they 
were feinting before a deadly oppo- 
nent. 

“I don’t feel it’s such a bad bar- 
gain,” said a thin, bespectacled 
physicist named Judson. He was 
seated across the room from Hock- 
ley. “I’ll vote to sacrifice the Lab in 
exchange for what the Rykes will 
give us.” 

“That’s the point,” said Hockley. 
“Exactly what are the Rykes going 
to give us? And we speak very glibly 
of sharing their science. But shall 
we actually be in any position to 
share it? What becomes of the class 
of scientists on Earth when the Lab 
is abandoned?” 

Wilkins stood abruptly, his hands 
shoved part way into his pockets 
and his lower jaw extended tensely. 
“I don’t believe that’s part of this 
question,” he said. It is not just we 
scientists who are to share the bene- 
fits of the Rykes. It is Mankind. At 
this time we have no right to con- 
sider mere personal concerns. We 
would betray our whole calling — 
our very humanity — if we thought 
for one moment of standing in the 
way of this development because of 
our personal concern over economic 
and professional problems. There 
has never been a time when a true 
scientist would not put aside his 
personal concerns for the good of 
all.” 

Hockley waited, half expecting 
somebody to start clapping. No one 
did, but there were glances of self- 
righteous approval in Wilkins’ di- 
rection. The biologist straightened 
the sleeves of his coat with a smug 

11 



gesture and awaited Hockley’s re- 
buttal. 

“We are Mankind,” Hockley said 
finally. “You and I are as much a 
part of humanity as that bus load 
of punch machine clerks and store 
managers passing on the street out- 
side. If we betray ourselves we have 
betrayed humanity. 

“This is not a sudden thing. It is 
the end point of a trend which has 
gone on for a long time. It began 
with our first contacts beyond the 
galaxy, when we realized there were 
peoples far in advance of us in 
science and economy. We have been 
feeding on them ever since. Our 
own developments have shrunk in 
direct proportion. For a long time 
we’ve been on the verge of becom- 
ing intellectual parasites in the Uni- 
verse. Acceptance of the Ryke offer 
will be the final step in that direc- 
tion.” 

Instantly, almost every other 
man in the room was talking at 
once. Hockley smiled faintly until 
the angry voices subsided. Then Sil- 
vers cleared his throat gently. He 
placed his glass beside the bottles 
on the table with a precise motion. 
“I am sure,” he said, “that a mo- 
ment’s thought will convince you 
that you do not mean what you 
have just said. 

“Consider the position of pupil 
and teacher. One of Man’s greatest 
failings is his predilection for assum- 
ing always the position of teacher 
and eschewing that of pupil. There 
is also the question of humility, in- 
tellectual humility. We scientists 
have always boasted of our readi- 
ness to set aside one so-called truth 
and accept another with more valid 
supporting evidence. 

12 


“Since our first contact with 
other galactic civilizations we have 
had the utmost need to adopt an 
attitude of humility. We have been 
fortunate in coming to a community 
of worlds where war and oppression 
are not standard rules of procedure. 
Among our own people we have 
encountered no such magnanimity 
as has been extended repeatedly by 
other worlds, climaxed now by the 
Ryke’s magnificent offer. 

“To adopt sincere intellectual 
humility and the attitude of the 
pupil is not to function as a parasite, 
Dr. Hockley.” 

“Your analogy of teacher and 
pupil is very faulty in expressing our 
relation to the Rykes,” said Hock- 
ley. “Or perhaps I should say it 
is too hellishly accurate. Would you 
have us remain the eternal pupils? 
The closing of the National 
Laboratories means an irreversible 
change in our position. Is it worth 
gaining a universe of knowledge to 
give up your own personal free in- 
quiry?” 

“I am sure none of us considers 
he is giving up his personal free in- 
quiry,” said Silvers almost angrily. 
“We see unlimited expansion be- 
yond anything we have imagined in 
our wildest dreams.” 

On a few faces there were frowns 
of uncertainty, but no one spoke 
up to support him. Hockley knew 
that until this vision of paradise 
wore off there were none of them on 
whom he could count. 

He smiled broadly and stood up 
to ease the tension in the room. 
“Well, it appears you have made 
your decision. Of course, Congress 
can accept the Ryke plan whether 
we approve or not, but it is good to 

RAYMOND F. JONES 



go on record one way or the other. 
I suppose that on the way out to- 
night it would be proper to check in 
at Personnel and file a services 
available notification.” 

And then he wished he hadn’t 
said that. Their faces grew a little 
more set at his unappreciated at- 
tempt at humor. 

S HQWALTER remained after 
the others left. He sat across the 
desk while Hockley turned back 
to the window. Only the tip of the 
gammatron tower now caught the 
late afternoon sunlight. 

“Maybe I’m getting old,” Hock- 
ley said. “Maybe they’re right and 
the Lab isn’t worth preserving if it 
means the difference between get- 
ting or not getting tutelage from the 
Rykes.” 

“But you don’t feel that’s true,” 
said Showalter. 

“No.” 

“You’re the one who built the 
Lab into what it is. It has as much 
worth as it ever had, and you have 
an obligation to keep it from being 
destroyed by a group of politicians 
who could never understand its 
necessity.” 

“I didn’t build it,” said Hockley. 
“It grew because I was able to find 
enough people who wanted the in- 
stitution to exist. But I’ve been 
away from research so long — I 
never was much good at it really. 
Did you ever know that? I’ve al- 
ways thought of myself as a sort of 
impressario of scientific produc- 
tions, if I might use such a term. 
Maybe those closer to the actual 
work are right. Maybe I’m just 
trying to hang onto the past. It 


could be time for a jump to a new 
kind of progress.” 

“You don’t believe any of that.” 

Hockley looked steadily in the di- 
rection of the Lab buildings. “I 
don’t believe any of it. That isn’t 
just an accumulation of buildings 
over there, with a name attached to 
them. It’s the advancing terminal 
of all Man’s history of trying to find 
out about himself and the Universe. 
It started before Neanderthal 
climbed into his caves a half million 
years ago. From then until now 
there’s a steady path of trial and 
error— of learning. There’s exulta- 
tion and despair, success and fail- 
ure. Now they want to say it was all 
for nothing.” 

“But to be pupils — to let the 
Rykes teach us — ” 

“The only trouble with Silvers’ 
argument is that our culture has 
never understood that teaching, in 
the accepted sense, is an impossi- 
bility. There can be only learning — 
never teaching. The teacher has to 
be eliminated from the actual learn- 
ing process before genuine learning 
can ever take place. But the Rykes 
offer to become the Ultimate 
Teacher.” 

“And if this is true,” said Show- 
alter slowly, “you couldn’t teach it 
to those who disagree, could you? 
They’d have to learn it for them- 
selves.” 

Hockley turned. For a moment 
he continued to stare at his as- 
sistant. Then his face broke into a 
narrow grin. “Of course you’re 
right 1 There’s only one way they’ll 
ever learn it : go through the actual 
experience of what Ryke tutelage 
will mean.” 


THE UNLEARNED 


13 



Most of the workrooms at In- 
formation Central were empty this 
time of evening. Hockley selected 
the first one he came to and called 
for every scrap of data pertaining 
to Rykeman III. There was a fair 
amount of information available on 
the physical characteristics of the 
world. Hockley scribbled swift, pri- 
vately intelligible notes as he 
scanned. The Rykes lived under a 
gravity one third heavier than 
Earth’s, with a day little more than 
half as long, and they received only 
forty percent as much heat from 
their frail sun as Earthmen were 
accustomed to. 

Cultural characteristics included 
a trading system that made the en- 
tire planet a single economic unit. 
And the planet had no history what- 
ever of war. The Rykes themselves 
had contributed almost nothing to 
the central libraries of the galaxies 
concerning their own personal 
makeup and mental functions, how- 
ever. What little was available came 
from observers not of their race. 

There were indications they were 
a highly unemotional race, not 
given to any artistic expression. 
Hockley found this surprising. The 
general rule was for highly intellec- 
tual attainments to be accompanied 
by equally high artistic expression. 

But all of this provided no data 
that he could relate to his present 
problem, no basis for argument be- 
yond what he already had. He re- 
turned the films to their silver cans 
and set staring at the neat pile of 
them on the desk. Then he smiled 
at his own obtuseness. Data on 
Rykeman III might be lacking, but 
the Ryke plan had been tried on 
plenty of other worlds. Data on 


them should not be so scarce. 

He returned the cans and 
punched out a new request on the 
call panel. Twenty seconds later he 
was pleasantly surprised by a score 
of new tapes in the hopper. That 
was enough for a full night’s work. 
He wished he’d brought Sho waiter 
along to help. 

Then his eye caught sight of the 
label on the topmost can in the pile : 
Janisson VIII. The name rang a 
familiar signal somewhere deep in 
his mind. Then he knew — that was 
the home world of Waldon Thar, 
one of his closest friends in the year 
when he’d gone to school at Galac- 
tic Center for advanced study. 

Thar had been one of the most 
brilliant researchers Hockley had 
ever known. In bull session debate 
he was instantly beyond the depth 
of everyone else. 

Janisson VIII. Thar could tell 
him about the Rykes! 

Hockley pushed the tape cans 
aside and went to the phone in the 
workroom. He dialed for the inter- 
stellar operator. “Government pri- 
ority call to Janisson VIII,” he 
said. “Waldon Thar. He attended 
Galactic Center Research Institute 
twenty-three years ago. He came 
from the city Plar, which was his 
home at that time. I have no other 
information, except that he is prob- 
ably employed as a research scien- 
tist.” 

There was a moment’s silence 
while the operator noted the in- 
formation. “There will be some de- 
lay,” she said finally. “At present 
the inter-galactic beams are full.” 

“I can use top emergency priority 
on this,” said Hockley. “Can you 
clear a trunk for me on that?” 


14 


RAYMOND F. JONES 



“Yes. One moment, please.” 

He sat by the window for half 
an hour, turning down the light in 
the workroom so that he could see 
the flow of traffic at the port west 
of the Lab buildings. Two space- 
ships took off and three came in 
while he waited. And . then the 
phone rang. 

“I’m sorry,” the operator said. 
“Waldon Thar is reported not on 
Janisson VIII. He went to Ryke- 
man III about two Earth years ago. 
Do you wish to attempt to locate 
him there?” 

“By all means,” said Hockley. 
“Same priority.” 

This was better than he had 
hoped for. Thar could really get 
him the information he needed on 
the Rykes. Twenty minutes later the 
phone rang again. In the operator’s 
first words Hockley sensed apology 
and knew the attempt had failed. 

“Our office has learned that Wal- 
den Thar is at present on tour as 
aide to the Ryke emissary, Liacan. 
We can perhaps trace — ” 

“No!” Hockley shouted. “That 
won’t be necessary. I know now — ” 
He almost laughed aloud to him- 
self. This was an incredible piece 
of good luck. Walden Thar was 
probably out at the space port right 
now — unless one of those ships tak- 
ing off had been the Ryke — 

He wondered why Thar had not 
tried to contact him. Of course, 
it had been a long time, but they 
had been very close at the center. 
He dialed the field control tower. 
“I want to know if the ship from 
Rykeman III has departed yet,” he 
said. 

“They were scheduled for six 
hours ago, but mechanical difficulty 

THE UNLEARNED 


has delayed them. Present estimated 
take-off is 1100.” 

Almost two hours to go, Hockley 
thought. That should be time 
enough. “Please put me in com- 
munication with one of the aides 
aboard named Waldon Thar. This 
is Sherman Hockley of Scientific 
Services. Priority request.” 

“I’ll try, sir.” The tower operator 
manifested a sudden increase of 
respect. “One moment, please.” 
Hockley heard the buzz and 
switch clicks of communication cir- 
cuits reaching for the ship. Then, 
in a moment, he heard the some- 
what irritated but familiar voice of 
his old friend. 

“Waldon Thar speaking,” the 
voice said. “Who wishes to talk?” 
“Listen, you old son of a cyclo- 
tron’s maiden aunt!” said Hockley. 
“Who would want to talk on Sol 
III? Why didn’t you give me a buzz 
when you landed? I just found out 
you were here.” 

“Sherm Hockley, of course,” the 
voice said with distant, unperturbed 
tones. “This is indeed a surprise and 
a pleasure. To be honest, I had for- 
gotten Earth was your home 
planet.” 

“I’ll try to think of something to 
jog your memory next time. How 
about getting together?” 

“Well — I don’t have very long,” 
said Thar hesitantly. “If you could 
come over for a few minutes — ” 
Hockley had the jolting feeling 
that Waldon Thar would just as 
soon pass up the opportunity for 
their meeting. Some of the en- 
thusiasm went out of his voice. 
“There’s a good all-night inter- 
planetary eatery and bar on the 
field there. I’ll be along in fifteen 

15 



minutes.” 

“Fine/’ said Thar, “but please 
try not to be late.” 

On the way to the field, Hockley 
wondered about the change that 
had apparently taken place in Thar. 
Of course, he had changed, too — 
perhaps for much the worse. But 
Thar sounded like a stuffed shirt 
now, and that is the last thing 
Hockley would have expected. In 
school, Thar had been the most ir- 
reverent of the whole class of irrev- 
erents, denouncing in ecstasy the 
established and unproven lore, rid- 
ing the professors of unsubstanti- 
ated hypotheses. Now — well, he 
didn’t sound like the Thar Hockley 
knew. 

He took a table and sat down just 
as Thar entered the dining room. 
The latter’s broad smile mo- 
mentarily removed Hockley’s 
doubts. The smile hadn’t changed. 
And there was the same expression 
of devilish disregard for the estab- 
lished order. The same warm 
friendliness. It baffled Hockley to 
understand how Thar could have 
failed to remember Earth was his 
home. 

Thar mentioned it as he came up 
and took Hockley’s hand. “I’m ter- 
ribly sorry,” he said. “It was stupid 
to forget that Earth meant Sherman 
Hockley.” 

“I know how it is. I should have 
written. I guess I’m the one who 
owes a letter.” 

“No, I think not,” said Thar. 

They sat on opposite sides of a 
small table near a window and or- 
dered drinks. On the field they 
could see the vast, shadowy outline 
of the Ryke vessel. 

16 


Thar was of a race genetically 
close to the Rykes. He lacked the 
feathery covering, but this was re- 
placed by a layer of thin scales, 
which had a tendency to stand on 
edge when he was excited. He also 
wore a breathing piece, and carried 
the small shoulder tank with a faint 
air of superiority. 

Hockley watched him with a 
growing sense of loss. The first im- 
pression had been more nearly cor- 
rect. Thar hadn’t wanted to meet 
him. 

“It’s been a long time,” said 
Hockley lamely. “I guess there isn’t 
much we did back there that means 
anything now.” 

“You shouldn’t say that,” said 
Thar as if recognizing he had been 
too remote. “Every hour of our ac- 
quaintance meant a great deal to 
me. I’ll never forgive myself for 
forgetting — but tell me how you 
learned I was aboard the Ryke 
ship.” 

“The Rykes have made us an 
offer. I wanted to find out the ef- 
fects on worlds that had accepted. I 
learned Janisson VIII was one, so I 
started looking.” 

“I’m so very glad you did, Sherm. 
You want me to confirm, of course, 
the advisability of accepting the 
offer Liacan has made.” 

“Confirm — or deny it,” said 
Hockley. 

Thar spread his clawlike hands. 
“Deny it? The most glorious oppor- 
tunity a planet could possibly 
have?” 

Something in Thar’s voice gave 
Hockley a sudden chill. “How has 
it worked on your own world?” 

“Janisson VIII has turned from 
a slum to a world of mansions. Our 


RAYMOND F. JONES 



economic problems have been 
solved. Health and long life are rou- 
tine. There is nothing we want that 
we cannot have for the asking . 55 

“But are you satisfied with it? Is 
there nothing which you had to give 
up that you would like returned ? 55 

Waldon Thar threw back his 
head and laughed in high pitched 
tones. “I might have known that 
would be the question you would 
ask! Forgive me, friend Sherman, 
but I had almost forgotten how un- 
venturesome you are. 

“Your question is ridiculous. Why 
should we wish to go back to our 
economic inequalities, poverty and 
distress, our ignorant plodding re- 
search in science? You can answer 
your own question . 55 

They were silent for a moment. 
Hockley thought his friend would 
have gladly terminated their visit 
right there and returned to his ship. 
To forestall this, he leaned across 
the table and asked, “Your science 
— what has become of that ? 55 

“Our science! We never had any. 
We were ignorant children playing 
with mud and rocks. We knew noth- 
ing. We had nothing. Until the 
Rykes offered to educate us . 55 

“Surely you don’t believe that , 55 
said Hockley quietly. “The problem 
you worked on at the Institute — 
gravity at micro-cosmic levels. That 
was not a childish thing . 55 

Thar laughed shortly and bitter- 
ly. “What disillusionment you have 
coming, friend Sherman! If you 
only knew how truly childish it was. 
Wait until you learn from the Rykes 
the true conception of gravity, its 
nature and the part it plays in the 
structure of matter . 55 

Hockley felt a sick tightening 

THE UNLEARNED 


within him. This was not the Wal- 
don Thar, the wild demon who 
thrust aside all authority and rumor 
in his own headlong search for 
knowledge. It couldn’t be Thar 
who was sitting passively by, being 
told what the nature of the Universe 
is. 

“Your scientists — ? 55 Hockley 
persisted. “What has become of all 
your researchers ? 55 

“The answer is the same , 55 said 
Thar. “We had no science. We had 
no scientists. Those who once went 
by that name have become for the 
first time honest students knowing 
the pleasure of studying at the feet 
of masters . 55 

“You have set up laboratories in 
which your researches are super- 
vised by the Rykes ? 55 

“Laboratories? We have no need 
of laboratories. We have workshops 
and study rooms where we try to 
absorb that which the Rykes dis- 
covered long ago. Maybe at some 
future time we will come to a point 
where we can reach into the fron- 
tier of knowledge with our own 
minds, but this does not seem likely 
now . 55 

“So you have given up all orig- 
inal research of your own ? 55 

“How could we do otherwise? 
The Rykes have all the answers to 
any question we have intelligence 
enough to ask. Follow them, Sher- 
man. It is no disgrace to be led by 
such as the Ryke teachers . 55 

“Don’t you ever long , 55 said 
Hockley, “to take just one short step 
on your own two feet ? 55 

“Why crawl when you can go by 
trans-light carrier?” 

Thar sipped the last of his drink 
and glanced toward the wall clock. 

17 



“I must go. I can understand the 
direction of your questions and your 
thinking. You hesitate because you 
might lose the chance to play in the 
mud and count the pretty pebbles 
in the sand. Put away childish 
things. You will never miss them!” 

They shook hands, and a moment 
later Hockley said goodbye to Thar 
at the entrance to the field. “I know 
Earth will accept,” said Thar. “And 
you and I should not have lost con- 
tact — but we’ll make up for it.” 

Watching him move toward the 
dark hulk of the ship, Hockley won- 
dered if Thar actually believed that. 
In less than an hour they had ex- 
hausted all they had to say after 
twenty years. Hockley had the in- 
formation he needed about the 
Ryke plan, but he wished he could 
have kept his old memories of his 
student friend. Thar was drunk on 
the heady stuff being peddled by 
the Rykes, and if what he said were 
true, it was strong enough to intoxi- 
cate a whole planet. 

His blood grew cold at the 
thought. This was more than a fight 
for the National Laboratories. It 
was a struggle to keep all Mankind 
from becoming what Thar had be- 
come. 

If he could have put Thar on ex- 
hibition in the meeting tomorrow, 
and shown what he was once like, 
he would have made his point. But 
Thar, before and after, was not 
available for exhibit. He had to find 
another way to show his colleagues 
and the Senators what the Rykes 
would make of them. 

He glanced at his watch. They 
wouldn’t like being wakened at this 
hour, but neither would the scien- 
tists put up much resistance to his 

18 


request for support in Markham’s 
meeting. He went back to the bar 
and called each of his colleages 
who had been in the meeting that 
day. 

H OCKLEY was called first when 
the assembly convened at ten 
that morning. He rose slowly from 
his seat near Markham and glanced 
over the somewhat puzzled expres- 
sions of the scientists. 

“I don’t know that I can speak 
for the entire group of scientists 
present,” he said. “We met yester- 
day and found some differences of 
opinion concerning this offer. While 
it is true there is overwhelming 
sentiment supporting it, certain 
questions remain, which we feel re- 
quire additional data in order to be 
answered properly. 

“While we recognize that official 
acceptance can be given to the 
Rykes with no approval whatever 
from the scientists, it seems only 
fair that we should have every op- 
portunity to make what we consid- 
er a proper study and to express 
our opinions in the matter. 

“To the non-scientist — and per- 
haps to many of my colleages — it 
may seem inconceivable that there 
could be any questions whatever. 
But we wonder about the position 
of students of future generations, 
we wonder about the details of ad- 
ministration of the program, we 
wonder about the total effects of the 
program upon our society as a 
whole. We wish to ask permission to 
make further study of the matter in 
an effort to answer these questions 
and many others. We request per- 
mission to go as a committee to 

RAYMOND F. JONES 



Rykeman III and make a first hand 
study of what the Rykes propose to 
do, how they will teach us, and how 
they will dispense the information 
they so generously offer. 

“I ask that you consider this most 
seriously, and make an official re- 
quest of the Rykes to grant us such 
opportunity for study, that you pro- 
vide the necessary appropriations 
for the trip. I consider it most ur- 
gent that this be done at once.” 

There was a stir of concern and 
disapproval from Congressional 
members as Hockley sat down. 
Senators leaned to speak in whis- 
pers to their neighbors, but Hockley 
observed the scientists remained 
quiet and impassive. He believed he 
had sold them in his telephone calls 
during the early morning. They 
liked the idea of obtaining addition- 
al data. Besides, most of them 
wanted to see Rykeman III for 
themselves. 

Senator Markham finally stood 
up, obviously disturbed by Hock- 
ley’s abrupt proposal. “It has 
seemed to us members of the Com- 
mittee that there could hardly be 
any need for more data than is al- 
ready available to us. The remark- 
able effects of Ryke science on other 
backward worlds is common knowl- 
edge. 

“On the other hand we recog- 
nize the qualifications of you gen- 
tlemen which make your request ap- 
pear justified. We will have to dis- 
cuss this at length, but at the 
moment I believe I can say I am 
in sympathy with your request and 
can encourage my Committee to 
give it serious consideration.” 

A great deal more was said on 

THE UNLEARNED 


that and subsequent days. News of 
the Ryke offer was not given to the 
public, but landing of the Ryke 
ship could not be hidden. It became 
known that Liacan carried his offer 
to other worlds and speculation was 
made that he offered it to Earth 
also. Angry questions were raised as 
to why the purpose of the visit was 
not clarified, but government si- 
lence was maintained while Hock- 
ley’s request was considered. 

It encountered bitter debate in 
the closed sessions, but permission 
was finally given for a junket of 
ninety scientists and ten senators to 
Rykeman III. 

This could not be hidden, so the 
facts were modified and a story 
given out that the party was going 
to request participation in the Ryke 
program being offered other worlds, 
that Liacan’s visit had not been 
conclusive. 

In the days preceding the take- 
off Hockley felt a sense of destiny 
weighing heavily upon him. He read 
every word of the stream of opinion 
that flowed through the press. Every 
commentator and columnist seemed 
called upon to make his own specific 
analysis of the possibilities of the 
visit to Rykeman III. And the 
opinions were almost uniform that 
it would be an approach to Utopia 
to have the Rykes take over. Hock- 
ley was sickened by this mass con- 
version to the siren call of the Rykes. 

It was a tremendous relief when 
the day finally came and the huge 
transport ship lifted solemnly into 
space. 

Most of the group were in the 
ship’s lounge watching the television 
port as the Earth drifted away be- 
neath them. Senator Markham 


19 



seemed nervous and almost fright- 
ened, Hockley thought, as if some- 
thing intangible had escaped him. 

“I hope we’re not wasting our 
time,” he said. “Not that I don’t 
understand your position,” he 
added hastily to cover the show of 
antagonism he sensed creeping into 
his voice. 

“We appreciate your support,” 
said Hockley, “and we’ll do our best 
to see the time of the investigation 
is not wasted.” 

But afterwards, when the two of 
them were alone by the screen, Sil- 
vers spoke to Hockley soberly. The 
mathematician had lost some of the 
wild exuberance he’d had at first. 
It had been replaced by a deep, in- 
tense conviction that nothing must 
stand in the way of Earth’s alliance 
with the Rykes. 

“We all understand why you 
wanted us to come,” he said. “We 
know you believe this delay will 
cool our enthusiasm. It’s only fair 
to make clear that it won’t. How 
you intend to change us by taking 
us to the home of the Rykes has got 
us all baffled. The reverse will be 
true, I am very sure. We intend to 
make it clear to the Rykes that we 
accept their offer. I hope you have 
no plan to make a declaration to the 
contrary.” 

Hockley kept his eyes on the 
screen, watching the green sphere 
of Earth. “I have no intention of 
making any statement of any kind. 
I was perfectly honest when I said 
our understanding of the Rykes 
would profit by this visit. You all 
agreed. I meant nothing more nor 
less than what I said. I hope no one 
in the group thinks otherwise.” 

“We don’t know,” said Silvers. 


“It’s just that you’ve got us won- 
dering how you expect to change 
our views.” 

“I have not said that is my inten- 
tion.” 

“Can you say it is not?” 

“No, I cannot say that. But the 
question is incomplete. My whole 
intention is to discover as fully as 
possible what will be the result of 
alliance with the Rykes. If you 
should conclude that it will be un- 
favorable that will be the result of 
your own direct observations and 
computations, not of my argu- 
ments.” 

“You may be sure that is one 
thing that will not occur,” said Sil- 
vers. 


I T TOOK them a month to reach 
a transfer point where they could 
change to a commercial vessel us- 
ing Ryke principles. In the follow- 
ing week they covered a distance 
several thousand times that which 
they had already come. And then 
they were on Rykeman III. 

A few of them had visited the 
planet previously, on vacation trips 
or routine study expeditions, but 
most of them were seeing it for the 
first time. While well out into space 
the group began crowding the vision 
screens which brought into range 
the streets and buildings of the 
cities. They could see the people 
walking and riding there. 

Hockley caught his breath at the 
sight, and doubts overwhelmed him, 
telling him he was an utter and 
complete fool. The city upon which 
he looked was a jewel of perfection. 
Buildings were not indiscriminate 
masses of masonry and metal and 

RAYMOND F. JONES 


20 



plastic heaped up without regard to 
the total effect. Rather, the city was 
a unit created with an eye to esthe- 
tic perfection. 

Silvers stood beside Hockley. 
“We’ve got a chance to make Earth 
look that way/’ said the mathema- 
tician. 

“There’s only one thing missing,” 
said Hockley. “The price tag. We 
still need to know what it’s going to 
cost.” 

Upon landing, the Earthmen 
were greeted by a covey of their 
bird-like hosts who scurried about, 
introducing themselves in their high 
whistling voices. In busses, they 
were moved half way across the city 
to a building which stood beside an 
enormous park area. 

It was obviously a building de- 
signed for the reception of just such 
delegations as this one, giving Hock- 
ley evidence that perhaps his idea 
was not so original after all. It was 
a relief to get inside after their brief 
trip across the city. Gravity, 
temperature, and air pressure and 
composition duplicated those of 
Earth inside, and conditions could 
be varied to accommodate many 
different species. Hockley felt con- 
fident they could become accus- 
tomed to outside conditions after a 
few days, but it was exhausting now 
to be out for long. 

They were shown to individual 
quarters and given leisure to un- 
pack and inspect their surroundings. 
Furniture had been adjusted to 
their size and needs. The only over- 
sight Hockley could find was a faint 
odor of chlorine lingering in the 
closets. He wondered who the last 
occupant of the room had been. 

After a noon meal, served with 

THE UNLEARNED 


foods of astonishingly close approxi- 
mation to their native fare, the 
group was offered a prelude to the 
general instruction and indoctrina- 
tion which would begin the follow- 
ing day. This was in the form of a 
guided tour through the science 
museum which, Hockley gathered, 
was a modernized Ryke parallel to 
the venerable Smithsonian back 
home. The tour was entirely option- 
al, as far as the planned program of 
the Rykes was concerned, but none 
of the Earthmen turned it down. 

Hockley tried to concentrate 
heavily on the memory of Waldon 
Thar and keep the image of his 
friend always before him as he 
moved through the city and in- 
spected the works of the Rykes. He 
found it helped suppress the awe 
and adulation which he had an im- 
pulse to share with his companions. 

It was possible even, he found, 
to adopt a kind of truculent cyni- 
cism toward the approach the Rykes 
were making. The visit to the sci- 
ence museum could be an attempt 
to bowl them over with an eon- 
long vista of Ryke superiority in the 
sciences. At least that was most cer- 
tainly the effect on them. Hockley 
cursed his own feeling of ignorance 
and inferiority as the guide led them 
quietly past the works of the mas- 
ters, offering but little comment, 
letting them see for themselves the 
obvious relationships. 

In the massive display showing 
developments of spaceflight, the 
atomic vessels, not much different 
from Earthmen’s best efforts, were 
far down the line, very near to the 
earliest attempts of the Rykes to 
rocket their way into space. Beyond 
that level was an incredible series of 

21 




developments incomprehensible to 
most of the Earthmen. 

And to all their questions the 
guide offered the monotonous re- 
ply: “That will be explained to you 
later. We only wish to give you an 
overall picture of our culture at the 
present time . 55 

But this was not enough for one 
of the astronomers, named Moore, 
who moved ahead of Hockley in the 
crowd. Hockley saw the back of 
Moore’s neck growing redder by 
the minute as the guide’s evasive 
answer was repeated. Finally, 
Moore forced a discussion regarding 
the merits of some systems of com- 
paring the brightness of stars, which 
the guide briefly showed them. The 
guide, in great annoyance, burst 
out with a stream of explanation 
that completely flattened any 
opinions Moore might have had. 
But at the same time the astronomer 
grinned amiably at the Ryke. 
“That ought to settle that,” he said. 
“I’ll bet it won’t take a week to get 
our system changed back home.” 

22 


Moore’s success loosened the re- 
straint of the others and they be- 
seiged the guide mercilessly then 
with opinions, questions, compari- 
sons — and even mild disapprovals. 
The guide’s exasperation was ob- 
vious — and pleasant — to Hockley, 
who remained a bystander. It was 
frightening to Markham and some 
of the other senators who were un- 
able to take part in the discussion. 
But most of the scientists failed to 
notice it in their eagerness to learn. 

After dinner that night they 
gathered in the lounge and study 
of their quarters. Markham stood 
beside Hockley as they partook cau- 
tiously of the cocktails which the 
Rykes had attempted to duplicate 
for them. The Senator’s awe had 
returned to overshadow any con- 
cern he felt during the events of the 
afternoon. “A wonderful day!” he 
said. “Even though this visit delays 
completion of our arrangements 
with the Rykes those of us here will 
be grateful forever that you pro- 
posed it. Nothing could have so im- 
pressed us all with the desirability 
of accepting the Ryke’s tutelage. It 
was a stroke of genius, Dr. Hockley. 
And for a time I thought you were 
actually opposed to the Rykes!” 

He sipped his drink while Hock- 
ley said nothing. Then his brow 
furrowed a bit. “But I wonder why 
our guide cut short our tour this 
afternoon. If I recall correctly he 
said at the beginning there was a 
great deal more to see than he ac- 
tually showed us.” 

Hockley smiled and sipped polite- 
ly at his drink before he set it down 
and faced the Senator. “I was won- 
dering if anyone else noticed that,” 
he said. 


RAYMOND F. JONES 



H OCKLEY slept well that night 
except for the fact that occa- 
sional whiffs of chlorine seemed to 
drift from various corners of the 
room even though he turned the 
air-conditioning system on full blast. 

In the morning there began a 
series of specialized lectures which 
had been prepared in accordance 
with the Earthmen’s request to ac- 
quaint them with what they would 
be getting upon acceptance of the 
Ryke offer. 

It was obviously no new experi- 
ence for the Rykes. The lectures 
were well prepared and anticipated 
many questions. The only thing new 
about it, Hockley thought, was the 
delivery in the language of the 
Earthmen. Otherwise, he felt this 
was something prepared a long time 
ago and given a thousand times or 
more. 

They were divided into smaller 
groups according to their special- 
ties, electronic men going one way, 
astronomers and mathematical 
physicists another, chemists and 
general physicists in still another 
direction. Hockley, Sho waiter and 
the senators were considered more 
or less free floating members of the 
delegation with the privilege of 
visiting with one group or another 
according to their pleasure. 

Hockley chose to spend the first 
day with the chemists, since that 
was his own first love. Dr. Sho- 
walter and Senator Markham came 
along with him. As much as he tried 
he found it virtually impossible not 
to sit with the same open-mouthed 
wonder that his colleagues exhib- 
ited. The swift, free-flowing exposi- 
tion of the Ryke lecturer led them 
immediately beyond their own 

THE UNLEARNED 


realms, but so carefully did he lead 
them that it seemed that they must 
have come this way before, and for- 
gotten it. 

Hockley felt half angry with him- 
self. He felt he had allowed himself 
to be hypnotized by the skill of the 
Ryke, and wondered despairingly if 
there were any chance at all of com- 
bating their approach. He saw noth- 
ing to indicate it in the experience 
of that day or the ones immediately 
following. But he retained hope that 
there was much significance in the 
action of the guide who had cut 
short their visit to the museum. 

In the evenings, in the study 
lofinge of the dormitory, they held 
interminable bull sessions exchang- 
ing and digesting what they had 
been shown during the day. It was 
at the end of the third day that 
Hockley thought he could detect a 
subtle change in the group. He had 
some difficulty analyzing it at first. 
It seemed to be a growing aliveness, 
a sort of recovery. And then he 
recognized that the initial stunned 
reaction to the magnificence of the 
Rykes was passing off. They had 
been shocked by the impact of the 
Rykes, almost as if they had been 
struck a blow on the head. Tempo- 
rarily, they had shelved all their 
own analytical and critical facilities 
and yielded to the Rykes without 
question. 

Now they were beginning to re- 
cover, springing back to a condition 
considerably nearer normal. Hock- 
ley felt a surge of encouragement as 
he detected a more sharply critical 
evaluation in the conversations that 
buzzed around him. The enthusi- 
asm was more measured. 

It was the following evening, 

23 



however, that witnessed the first 
event of pronounced shifting of any- 
one’s attitude. They had finished 
dinner and were gathering in the 
lounge, sparring around, setting up 
groups for the bull sessions that 
would go until long after midnight. 
Most of them had already settled 
down and were talking part in con- 
versations or were listening quietly 
when they were suddenly aware of 
a change in the atmosphere of the 
room. 

For a moment there was a general 
turning of heads to locate the 
source of the disturbance. Hockley 
knew he could never describe just 
what made him look around, but 
he was abruptly conscious that Dr. 
Silvers was walking into the lounge 
and looking slowly about at those 
gathered there. Something in his 
presence was like the sudden ap- 
pearance of a thundercloud, his face 
seemed to reflect the dark turbu- 
lence of a summer storm. 

He said nothing, however, to any- 
one but strode over and sat beside 
Hockley, who was alone at the mo- 
ment smoking the next to last of his 
Earthside cigars. Hockley felt the 
smouldering turmoil inside the 
mathematician. He extended his 
final cigar. Silvers brushed it away. 

“The last one,” said Hockley 
mildly. “In spite of all their abilities 
the Ryke imitations are somewhat 
less than natural.” 

Silvers turned slowly to face 
Hockley. “I presented them with 
the Legrandian Equations today,” 
he said. “I expected to get a 
straightforward answer to a perfect- 
ly legitimate scientific question. 
That is what we were led to expect, 
was it not?” 

24 


Hockley nodded. “That’s my im- 
pression. Did you get something less 
than a straightforward answer?” 
The mathematician exhaled nois- 
ily. “The Legrandian Equations will 
lead to a geometry as revolutionary 
as Riemann’s was in his day. But 
I was told by the Rykes that I 
‘should dismiss it from all further 
consideration. It does not lead to 
any profitable mathematical de- 
velopment.’ ” 

Hockley felt that his heart most 
certainly skipped a beat, but he 
managed to keep his voice steady, 
and sympathetic. “That’s too bad. 
I know what high hopes you had. I 
suppose you will give up work on 
the Equations now?” 

“I will not!” Silvers exclaimed 
loudly. Nearby groups who had re- 
turned hesitantly to their own con- 
versations now stared at him again. 
But abruptly he changed his tone 
and looked almost pleadingly at 
Hockley. “I don’t understand it. 
Why should they say such a thing? 
It appears to be one of the most 
profitable avenues of exploration I 
have encountered in my whole 
career. And the Rykes brush it 
aside!” 

“What did you say when they 
told you to give it up?” 

“I said I wanted to know where 
the development would lead. I said 
it had been indicated that we could 
have an answer to any scientific 
problem within the range of their 
abilities, and certainly this is, from 
what I’ve seen. 

“The instructor replied that I’d 
been given an answer to my ques- 
tion, that ‘the first lesson you must 
learn if you wish to acquire our 
pace in science is to recognize that 

RAYMOND F. JONES 



we have been along the path ahead 
of you. We know which are the pos- 
sibilities that are worthwhile to de* 
velop. We have gained our speed by 
learning to bypass every avenue but 
the main one, and not get lost in 
tempting side roads. 9 

“He said that we’ve got to learn 
to trust them and take their word as 
to which is the correct and profit- 
able field of research, that ‘we will 
show you where to go, as we agreed 
to do. If you are not willing to ac- 
cept our leadership in this respect 
our agreement means nothing.’ 
Wouldn’t that be a magnificent 
way to make scientific progress!” 

The mathematician shifted in his 
chair as if trying to control an in- 
ternal fury that would not be 
capped. He held out his hand 
abruptly. “I’ll take that cigar after 
all, if you don’t mind, Hockley.” 

With savage energy he chewed 
the end and ignited the cigar, then 
blew a mammoth cloud of smoke 
ceilingward. “I think the trouble 
must be in our lecturer,” he said. 
“He’s crazy. He couldn’t possibly 
represent the conventional attitude 
of the Rykes. They promised to give 
answers to our problems — and this 
is the kind of nonsense I get. I’m 
going to see somebody higher up 
and find out why we can’t have a 
lecturer who knows what he’s 
talking about. Or maybe you or 
Markham would rather take it up 
— through official channels, as it 
were?” 

“The Ryke was correct,” said 
Hockley. “He did give you an an- 
swer.” 

“He could answer all our ques- 
tions that way!” 

“You’re perfectly right,” said 

THE UNLEARNED 


Hockley soberly. “He could do ex- 
actly that.” 

“They won’t of course,” said Sil- 
vers, defensively. “Even if this par- 
ticular character isn’t just playing 
the screwball, my question is just a 
special case. It’s just one particular 
thing they consider to be valueless. 
Perhaps in the end I’ll find they’re 
right — but I’m going to develop a 
solution to these Equations if it 
takes the rest of my life! 

“After all, they admit they have 
no solution, that they have not 
bothered to go down this particular 
side path, as they put it. If we don’t 
go down it how can we ever know 
whether it’s worthwhile or not? 
How can the Rykes know what they 
may have missed by not doing so?” 

“I can’t answer that,” said Hock- 
ley. “For us or for them, I know of 
no other way to predict the outcome 
of a specific line of research except 
to carry it through and find out 
what lies at the end of the road.” 


H OCKLEY didn’t sleep very well 
after he finally went to bed 
that night. Silvers had presented 
him with the break he had been ex- 
pecting and hoping for. The first 
chink in the armor of sanctity sur- 
rounding the Rykes. Now he won- 
dered what would follow, if this 
would build up to the impassable 
barrier he wanted, or if it would 
merely remain a sore obstacle in 
their way but eventually be by- 
passed and forgotten. 

He did not believe it would be 
the only incident of its kind. There 
would be others as the Earthmen’s 
stunned, blind acceptance gave way 
completely to sound, critical evalu* 

25 



ation. And in any case there was 
one delegate who would never be 
the same again. No matter how he 
eventually rationalized it Dr. For- 
man K. Silvers would never feel 
quite the same about the Rykes as 
he did before they rejected his fav- 
orite piece of research. 

Hockley arose early, eager but 
cautious, his senses open for further 
evidence of disaffection springing 
up. He joined the group of chemists 
once more for the morning lecture. 
The spirit of the group was marked- 
ly higher than when he first met 
with them. They had been inspired 
by what the Rykes had shown them, 
but in addition their own sense of 
judgment had been brought out of 
suspension. 

The Ryke lecturer began inscrib- 
ing on the board an enormous or- 
ganic formula, using conventions of 
Earth chemistry for the benefit of 
his audience. He explained at some 
length a number of transformations 
which it was possible to make in the 
compound by means of high in- 
tensity fields. 

Almost at once, one of the young- 
er chemists named Dr. Carmen, 
was on his feet exclaiming excitedly 
that one of the transformation com- 
pounds was a chemical on which he 
had conducted an extensive re- 
search. He had produced enough to 
know that it had a multitude of in- 
triguing properties, and now he was 
exuberant at the revelation of a 
method of producing it in quantity 
and also further transforming it. 

At his sudden enthusiasm the lec- 
turer’s face took on what they had 
come to recognize as a very dour 
look. “That series of transforma- 
tions has no interest for us,” he said. 

26 


“I merely indicated its existence to 
show one of the possibilities which 
should be avoided. Over here you 
see the direction in which we wish 
to go.” 

“But you never saw anything 
with properties like that!” Carmen 
protested. “It goes through an in- 
credible series of at least three crys- 
talline-liquid phase changes with an 
increase in pressure alone. But with 
proper control of heat it can be 
kept in the crystalline phase regard- 
less of pressure. It is closely related 
to a drug series with anesthetic 
properties, and is almost sure to 
be valuable in — ” 

The Ryke lecturer cut him off 
sharply. “I have explained,” he said, 
“the direction of transformation in 
which we are interested. Your con- 
cern is not with anything beyond 
the boundaries which our study has 
proven to be the direct path of re- 
search and study.” 

“Then I should abandon research 
on this series of chemicals?” Car- 
men asked with a show of outward 
meekness. 

The Ryke nodded with pleasure 
at Carmen’s submissiveness. “That 
is it precisely. We have been over 
this ground long ago. We know 
where the areas of profitable study 
lie. You will be told what to observe 
and what to ignore. How could you 
ever hope to make progress if you 
stopped to examine every alternate 
probability and possibility that ap- 
peared to you?” He shook his head 
vigorously and his plume vibrated 
with emotion. 

“You must have a plan,” he con- 
tinued. “A goal. Study of the Uni- 
verse cannot proceed in any ran- 
dom, erratic fashion. You must 

RAYMOND F. JONES 



know what you want and then find 
out where to look for it.” 

Carmen sat down slowly. Hock- 
ley was sure the Ryke did not notice 
the tense bulge of the chemist’s jaw 
muscles. Perhaps he would not have 
understood the significance if he 
had noticed. 

Hockley was a trifle late in get- 
ting to the dining room at lunch 
time that day. By the time he did 
so the place was like a beehive. He 
was almost repelled by the furor of 
conversation circulating in the room 
as he entered. 

He passed through slowly, search- 
ing for a table of his own. He 
paused a moment behind Dr. Car- 
men, who was declaiming in no 
mild terms his opinions of a system 
that would pre-select those areas 
of research which were to be en- 
tered and those which were not. He 
smiled a little as he caught the eye 
of one of the dozen chemists seated 
at the table, listening. 

Moving on, he observed that Sil- 
vers had also cornered a half dozen 
or so of his colleagues in his own 
field and was in earnest conversa- 
tion with them — in a considerably 
more restrained manner, however, 
than he had used the previous eve- 
ning with Hockley, or than Carmen 
was using at the present time. 

The entire room was abuzz with 
similar groups. 

The senators had tried to mingle 
with the others in past days, always 
with more or less lack of success 
because they found themselves out 
of the conversation almost com- 
pletely. Today they had no luck 
whatever. They were seated to- 
gether at a couple of tables in a 

THE UNLEARNED 


corner. None of them seemed to 
be paying attention to the food 
before them, but were glancing 
about, half-apprehensively, at their 
fellow diners — who were also pay- 
ing no attention to food. 

Hockley caught sight of his poli- 
tical colleagues and sensed their dis- 
may. The field of disquietude 
seemed almost tangible in the air. 
The senators seemed half frightened 
by what they felt but could not un- 
derstand. 

Showalter’s wild waving at the 
far corner of the room finally caught 
Hockley’s eye and he moved toward 
the small table which the assistant 
had reserved for them. Sho waiter 
was upset, too, by the atmosphere 
within the room. 

“What the devil is up?” he said. 
“Seems like everybody’s on edge 
this morning. I never saw a bunch 
of guys so touchy. You’d think they 
woke up with snakes in their beds.” 

“Didn’t you know?” said Hock- 
ley. “Haven’t you been to any of 
the lectures this morning?” 

“No. A couple of the senators 
were getting bored with all the 
scientific doings so I thought maybe 
I should try to entertain them. We 
took in what passes for such here, 
but it wasn’t much better than the 
lectures as a show. Tell me what’s 

53 

up. 

Briefly, Hockley described Sil- 
vers’ upset of the day before and 
Carmen’s experience that morning. 
Showalter let his glance rove over 
his fellow Earthmen, trying to catch 
snatches of the buzzing conversation 
at nearby tables. 

“You think that’s the kind of 
thing that’s got them all going this 
morning?” he said. 


27 



Hockley nodded. “I caught 
enough of it passing through to 
know that’s what it is. I gather that 
every group has run into the same 
kind of thing by now, the fencing 
off of broad areas where we have 
already tried to do research. 

“After the first cloud of awe wore 
off, the first thing everyone wanted 
was an answer to his own pet line 
of research. Nine times out of ten it 
was something the Rykes told them 
to chuck down the drain. That ad- 
vice doesn’t sit so well — as you can 
plainly see.” 

Showalter drew back his gaze and 
stared for a long time at Hockley. 
“You knew this would happen. 
That’s why you brought us here—” 

“I had hopes of it. I was reason- 
ably sure this was the way the 
Rykes operated.” 

Showalter remained thoughtful 
for a long time before he spoke 
again. “You’ve won your point, I 
suppose, as far as this group goes, 
but you can’t hope to convince all 
of Earth by this. The Rykes will 
hold their offer open, and others 
will accept it on behalf of Earth. 

“And what if it’s we who are 
wrong, in the end? How can you be 
sure that this isn’t the way the Rykes 
have made their tremendous speed 
— by not going down all the blind 
alleys that we rattle around in.” 

“I’m sure it is the way they have 
attained such speed of advance- 
ment.” 

“Then maybe we ought to go 
along, regardless of our own desires. 
Maybe we never did know how to 
do research!” 

Hockley smiled across the table 
at his assistant. “You believe that, 
of course.” 


“I’m just talking,” said Showal- 
ter irritably. “The thing gets more 
loopy every day. If you think you 
understand the Rykes I wish you 
would give out with what the score 
is. By the looks of most of these guys 
I would say they are getting ready 
to throttle the next Ryke they see 
instead of knuckle under to him.” 

“I hope you’re right,” said Hock- 
ley fervently. “I certainly hope 
you’re right.” 

Y EVENING there was increas- 
ing evidence that he was. Hock- 
ley passed up the afternoon lecture 
period and spent the time in the 
lounge doing some thinking of his 
own. He knew he couldn’t push the 
group. Above all, he mustn’t give 
way to any temptation to push them 
or say, “I told you so.” Their pres- 
ent frustration was so deep that 
their antagonism could be turned 
almost indiscriminately in any di- 
rection, and he would be offering 
himself as a ready target if he were 
not careful. 

On the other hand he had to be 
ready to take advantage of their 
disaffection and throw them a deci- 
sive challenge when they were 
ready for it. That might be tonight, 
or it might be another week. He 
wished for a sure way of knowing. 
As things turned out, however, the 
necessity of choosing the time was 
taken from him. 

After dinner that night, when the 
group began to drift into the 
lounge, Silvers and Carmen and 
three of the other men came over to 
where Hockley sat. Silvers fumbled 
with the buttons of his coat as if 
preparing to make an address:

“We’d like to request/’ he said, 
“that is — we think we ought to get 
together. We’d like you to call a 
meeting, Hockley. Some of us have 
a few things we’d like to talk over.” 

Hockley nodded, his face impas- 
sive. 

“The matter I mentioned to you 
the other night,” said Silvers. “It’s 
been happening to all the men. We 
think we ought to talk about it.” 

“Fine,” said Hockley. “I’ve been 
thinking it would perhaps be a good 
idea. Pass the word around and let’s 
get some chairs. We can convene in 
ten minutes.” 

The others nodded somberly and 
moved away with all the enthusiasm 
of preparing for a funeral, And 
maybe that’s what it would be, 
Hockley thought — somebody’s fun- 
eral. He hoped it would be the 
Rykes. 

The room began filling almost at 
once, as if they had been expecting 
the call. In little more than five 
minutes it seemed that every mem- 
ber of the Earth delegation had as- 
sembled, leaving time to spare. 

The senators still wore their looks 
of puzzlement and half-frightened 
anxiety, which had intensified if 
anything. There was no puzzlement 
on the faces of the scientists, how- 
ever, only a set and determined ex- 
pression that Hockley hardly dared 
interpret as meaning they had made 
up their minds. He had to have 
their verbal confirmation. 

Informally, he thrust his hands in 
his pockets and sauntered to the 
front of the group. 

“I have been asked to call a meet- 
ing,” he said, “by certain members 
of the group who have something 
on their minds. They seem to feel 

THE UNLEARNED 


we’d all be interested in what is 
troubling them. Since I have noth- 
ing in particular to say I’m simply 
going to turn the floor over to those 
of you who have. Dr. Silvers first 
approached me to call this discus- 
sion, so I shall ask him to lead off. 
Will you come to the front, Dr. 
Silvers?” 

The mathematician rose as if 
wishing someone else would do the 
talking. He stood at one side of the 
group, halfway to the rear. “I can 
do all right from here,” he said* 

After a pause, as if coming to a 
momentous decision, he plunged 
into his complaint. “It appears that 
nearly all of us have encountered 
an aspect of the Ryke culture and 
character which was not antici- 
pated when we first received their 
offer.” Briefly, he related the details 
of the Ryke rejection of his research 
on the Legrandian Equations. 

“We were told we were going to 
have all our questions answered, 
that the Ryke’s science included all 
we could anticipate or hope to ac- 
complish in the next few millenia. 
I swallowed that. We all did. It ap- 
pears we were slightly in error. It 
begins to appear as if we are not 
going to find the intellectual para- 
dise we anticipated.” 

He smiled wryly. “I’m sure none 
of you is more ready than I to ad- 
mit he has been a fool. It appears 
that paradise, so-called, consists 
merely of a few selected gems which 
the Rykes consider particularly 
valuable, while the rest of the field 
goes untouched. 

“I want to offer public apologies 
to Dr. Hockley, who saw and un- 
derstood the situation as it actually 
existed, while the rest of us had our 

*29 



heads in the clouds. Exactly how he 
knew, I’m not sure, but he did, and 
very brilliantly chose the only way 
possible to convince us that what 
he knew was correct. 

“I suggest we do our packing to- 
night, gentlemen. Let us return at 
once to our laboratories and spend 
the rest of our lives in some degree 
of atonement for being such fools as 
to fall for the line the Rykes tried 
to sell us . 55 

Hockley’s eyes were on the sena- 
tors. At first there were white faces 
filled with incredulity as the mathe- 
matician proceeded. Then slowly 
this changed to sheer horror. 

When Silvers finished, there was 
immediate bedlam. There was a 
clamor of voices from the scientists, 
most of whom seemed to be trying 
to affirm Silvers’ position. This was 
offset by explosions of rage from the 
senatorial members of the group. 

Hockley let it go, not even raising 
his hands for order until finally the 
racket died of its own accord as the 
eyes of the delegates came to rest 
upon him. 

And then, before he could speak, 
Markham was on his feet. “This is 
absolutely moral treachery,” he 
thundered. “I have never heard a 
more vicious revocation of a 
pledged word than I have heard 
this evening. 

“You men are not alone con- 
cerned in this matter. For all prac- 
tical purposes you are not concerned 
at all! And yet to take it upon your- 
selves to pass judgment in a matter 
that is the affair of the entire popu- 
lation of Earth — out of nothing 
more than sheer spite because the 
Rykes refuse recognition of your 
own childish projects! I have never 


heard a more incredible and infan- 
tile performance than you sup- 
posedly mature gentlemen of 
science are expressing this evening.” 
He glared defiantly at Hockley, 
who was again the center of atten- 
tion moving carelessly to the center 
of the stage. “Anybody want to try 
to answer the Senator?” he asked 
casually. 

Instantly, a score of men were on 
their feet, speaking simultaneously. 
They stopped abruptly, looking 
deferentially to their neighbors and 
at Hockley, inviting him to choose 
one of them to be spokesman. 

“Maybe I ought to answer him 
myself,” said Hockley, “since I pre- 
dicted that this would occur, and 
that we ought to make a trial run 
before turning our collective gray 
matter over to the Rykes.” 

A chorus of approval and nod- 
ding heads gave him the go ahead. 

“The Senator is quite right in 
saying that we few are not alone 
in our concern in this matter,” he 
said. “But the Senator intends to 
imply a major difference between 
us scientists and the rest of man- 
kind. This is his error. 

“Every member of Mankind who 
is concerned about the Universe 
in which he lives, is a scientist. You 
need to understand what a scien- 
tist is — and you can say no more 
than that he is a human being try- 
ing to solve the problem of under- 
standing his Universe, immediate or 
remote. He is concerned about the 
inanimate worlds, his own personal- 
ity, his fellow men — and the inter- 
weaving relationships among all 
these factors. We professional scien- 
tists are no strange species, alien to 
our race. Our only difference is per- 

RAYMOND F. JONES 


30 



haps that we undertake more prob- 
lems than does the average of our 
fellow men, and of a more complex 
kind. That is all. 

“The essence of our science is a 
relentless personal yearning to know 
and understand the Universe. And 
in that, the scientist must not be 
forbidden to ask whatever question 
occurs to him. The moment we put 
any restraint upon our fields of in- 
quiry, or set bounds to the realms 
of our mental aspirations, our 
science ceases to exist and becomes 
a mere opportunist technology.” 

Markham stood up, his face red 
with exasperation and rage. “No 
one is trying to limit you! Why is 
that so unfathomable to your 
minds? You are being offered a 
boundless expanse, and you con- 
tinue to make inane complaints of 
limitations. The Rykes have been 
over all the territory you insist on 
exploring. They can tell you the 
number of pretty pebbles and empty 
shells that lie there. You are like 
children insistent upon exploring 
every shadowy corner and peering 
behind every useless bush on a walk 
through the forest. 

“Such is to be expected of a child, 
but not of an adult, who is capable 
of taking the word of one who has 
been there before!” 

“There are two things wrong 
with your argument,” said Hockley. 
“First of all, there is no essential 
difference between the learning of 
a child who must indeed explore 
the dark corners and strange 
growths by which he passes — there 
is no difference between this and 
the probing of the scientist, who 
must explore the Universe with his 
own senses and with his own instru- 

THE UNLEARNED 


ments, without taking another’s 
word that there is nothing there 
worth seeing. 

“Secondly, the Rykes themselves 
are badly in error in asserting that 
they have been along the way ahead 
of us. They have not. In all their 
fields of science they have limited 
themselves badly to one narrow 
field of probability. They have 
taken a narrow path stretching be- 
tween magnificent vistas on either 
side of them, and have deliberately 
ignored all that was beyond the 
path and on the inviting side trails.” 

“Is there anything wrong with 
that?” demanded Markham. “If 
you undertake a journey you don’t 
weave in and out of every possible 
path that leads in every direction 
opposed to your destination. You 
take the direct route. Or at least 
ordinary people do.” 

“Scientists do, too,” said Hockley, 
“when they take a journey. Profes- 
sional science is not a journey, how- 
ever. It’s an exploration. 

“There is a great deal wrong 
with what the Rykes have done. 
They have assumed, and would 
have us likewise assume, that there 
is a certain very specific future to- 
ward which we are all moving. This 
future is built out of the discoveries 
they have made about the Universe. 
It is made of the system of mathe- 
matics they have developed, which 
exclude Dr, Silvers’ cherished Le- 
grandian Equations. It excludes the 
world in which exist Dr. Carmen’s 
series of unique compounds. 

“The Rykes have built a wonder- 
ful, workable world of serenity, 
beauty, scientific consistency, and 
economic adjustment. They have 
eliminated enormous amounts of 


31 



chaos which Earthmen continue to 
suffer. 

“But we do not want what the 
Rykes have obtained — if we have 
to pay their price for it.” 

“Then you are complete fools,” 
said Markham. “Fortunately, you 
cannot and will not speak for all of 
Earth.” 

Hockley paced back and forth a 
half dozen steps, his eyes on the 
floor. “I think we do — and can — 
speak for all our people,” he said. 
“Remember, I said that all men are 
scientists in the final analysis. I am 
very certain that no Earthman who 
truly understood the situation 
would want to face the future which 
the Rykes hold out to us.” 

“And why not?” demanded 
Markham. 

“Because there are too many pos- 
sible futures. We refuse to march 
down a single narrow trail to the 
golden future. That’s what the 
Rykes would have us do. But they 
are wrong. It would be like taking 
a trip through a galaxy at speeds 
faster than light — and claiming to 
have seen the galaxy. What the 
Rykes have obtained is genuine and 
good, but what they have not ob- 
tained is perhaps far better and of 
greater worth.” 

“How can you know such an ab- 
surd thing?” 

“We can’t — not for sure,” said 
Hockley. “Not until we go there 
and see for ourselves, step by step. 
But we aren’t going to be confined 
to the Rykes’ narrow trail. We are 
going on a broad path to take in as 
many byways as we can possibly 
find. We’ll explore every probability 
we come to, and look behind every 
bush and under every pebble. 

32 


“We will move together, the 
thousands and the millions of us, 
simultaneously, interacting with 
one another, exchanging data. 
Most certainly, many will end up 
in blind alleys. Some will find data 
that seems the ultimate truth at 
one point and pure deception at 
another. Who can tell ahead of 
time which of these multiple paths 
we should take? Certainly not the 
Rykes, who have bypassed most of 
them ! 

“It doesn’t matter that many 
paths lead to failure — not as long 
as we remain in communication 
with each other. In the end we will 
find the best possible future for us. 
But there is no one future, only a 
multitude of possible futures. We 
must have the right to build the one 
that best fits our own kind.” 

“Is that more important than 
achieving immediately a more 
peaceful, unified, and secure so- 
ciety?” said Markham. 

“Infinitely more important!” said 
Hockley. 

“It is fortunate at least, then, 
that you are in no position to im- 
plement these insane beliefs of 
yours. The Ryke program was of- 
fered to Earth, and it shall be ac- 
cepted on behalf of Earth. You 
may be sure of a very poor hearing 
when you try to present these no- 
tions back home.” 

“You jump to conclusions, Sena- 
tor,” said Hockley with mild con- 
fidence. “Why do you suppose I 
proposed this trip if I did not be- 
lieve I could do something about 
the situation? I assure you that we 
did not come just to see the sights.” 
Markham’s jaw slacked and his 
face became white. “What do you 

RAYMOND F. JONES 



mean? You haven’t dared to try to 
alienate the Rykes — ” 

“I mean that there is a great deal 
we can do about the situation. Now 
that the sentiments of my colleagues 
parallel my own I’m sure they 
agree that we must effectively and 
finally spike any possibility of 
Earth’s becoming involved in this 
Ryke nonsense.” 

“You wouldn’t dare! — even if 
you could — ” 

“We can, and we dare,” said 
Hockley. “When we return to Earth 
we shall have to report that the 
Rykes have refused to admit Earth 
to their program. We shall report 
that we made every effort to obtain 
an agreement with them, but it was 
in vain. If anyone wishes to verify 
the report, the Rykes themselves 
will say that this is quite true : they 
cannot possibly consider Earth as a 
participant. If you contend that an 
offer was once made, you will not 
find the Rykes offering much sup- 
port since they will be very busily 
denying that we are remotely quali- 
fied.” ^ 

“The Rykes are hardly ones to 
meekly submit to any idiotic plan 
of that kind.” 

“They can’t help it — if we dem- 
onstrate that we are quite unquali- 
fied to participate.” 

“You— you— ” 

“It will not be difficult,” said 
Hockley. “The Rykes have set up 
a perfect teacher-pupil situation, 
with all the false assumptions that 
go with it. There is at least one ab- 
solutely positive way to disintegrate 
such a situation. The testimony of 
several thousand years’ failure of 
our various educational systems in- 
dicates that there are quite a variety 

THE UNLEARNED 


of lesser ways also— 

“Perhaps you are aware of the 
experiences and techniques com- 
monly employed on Earth by white 
men in their efforts to educate the 
aborigine. The first procedure is 
to do away with the tribal medicine 
men, ignore their lore and learn- 
ing. Get them to give up the magic 
words and their pots of foul smell- 
ing liquids, abandon their ritual 
dances and take up the white man’s 
great wisdom. 

“We have done this time after 
time, only to learn decades later 
that the natives once knew much of 
anesthetics and healing drugs, and 
had genuine powers to communi- 
cate in ways the white man can’t 
duplicate. 

“But once in a long while a group 
of aborigines show more spunk 
than the average. They refuse to 
give up their medicine men, their 
magic and their hard earned lore 
accumulated over generations and 
centuries. Instead of giving these 
things up they insist on the white 
man’s learning these mysteries in 
preference to his nonsensical and 
ineffective magic. They completely 
frustrate the situation, and if they 
persist they finally destroy the white 
man as an educator. He is forced to 
conclude that the ignorant savages 
are unteachable. 

“It is an infallible technique — 
and one that we shall employ. Dr. 
Silvers will undertake to teach his 
mathematical lecturer in the ap- 
proaches to the Legrandian Equa- 
tions. He will speculate long and 
noisily on the geometry which po- 
tentially lies in this mathematical 
system. Dr. Carmen will ellucidate 
at great length on the properties of 

33 



the chain of chemicals he has been 
advised to abandon. 

“Each of us has at least one line 
of research the Rykes would have 
us give up. That is the very thing 
we shall insist on having investi- 
gated. We shall teach them these 
things and prove Earthmen to be 
an unlearned, unteachable band of 
aborigines who refuse to pursue the 
single path to glory and light, but 
insist on following every devious 
byway and searching every dark- 
ness that lies beside the path. 

“It ought to do the trick. I esti- 
mate it should not be more than a 
week before we are on our way 
back home, labeled by the Rykes 
as utterly hopeless material for 
their enlightenment.” 

The senators seemed momentari- 
ly appalled and speechless, but 
they recovered shortly and had a 
considerable amount of high flown 
oratory to distribute on the subject. 
The scientists, however, were com- 
paratively quiet, but on their faces 
was a subdued glee that Hockley 
had to admit was little short of 
fiendish. It was composed, he 
thought, of all the gloating antici- 
pations of all the schoolboys who 
had ever put a thumbtack on the 
teacher’s chair. 

Hockley was somewhat off in his 


prediction. It was actually a mere 
five days after the beginning of the 
Earthmen’ s campaign that the 
Rykes gave them up and put them 
firmly aboard a vessel bound for 
home. The Rykes were apologetic 
but firm in admitting they had 
made a sorry mistake, that Earth- 
men would have to go their own 
hopeless way while the Rykes led 
the rest of the Universe toward 
enlightenment and glory. 

Hockley, Showalter, and Silvers 
watched the planet drop away be- 
neath them. Hockley could not help 
feeling sympathetic toward the 
Rykes. “I wonder what will hap- 
pen,” he said slowly, “when they 
crash headlong into an impassable 
barrier on that beautiful, straight 
road of theirs. I wonder if they’ll 
ever have enough guts to turn 
aside?” 

“I doubt it,” said Showalter. 
“They’ll probably curl up and call 
it a day.” 

Silvers shook his head as if to 
ward off an oppressive vision. 
“That shouldn’t be allowed to hap- 
pen,” he said. “They’ve got too 
much. They’ve achieved too much, 
in spite of their limitations. I won- 
der if there isn’t some way we could 
help them?”

By William F. Nolan 


The human race, Theodore complained, was be- 
coming as extinct as the dodo bird — all because of 
the mechanoids . So he rebelled and quit his job and 
tried to get rid of Margaret . 


I T’S JUST around the next turn,” 
Rice said, peering from the 
tinted windows as the car skimmed 
over the warm summer streets of 
the city. 

The vehicle slowed, took the long 
curve with fluid grace, and whis- 


pered to a stop. A silver door-panel 
sighed back and Ted Rice stepped 
into the heat of morning. His suit- 
conditioner immediately circulated 
an inner breath of cool air to bal- 
ance the rise in temperature. 

“I won’t need you for the rest of 


35 



the day, 5 ’ he told the car. ‘Til be 
walking home.” 

“May I have your location num- 
ber sir, in case a member of the 
family should wish to contact you?” 

“No, dammit, you may not!” 
This was Free-Day. He needn’t tell 
the car anything. “Go home.” 

“Very well, sir.” The machine 
slid obediently from the curb. Rice 
watched it glitter briefly, like a lake 
trout in the moving wash of morn- 
ing traffic, and disappear. 

On Free-Days he told the car 
what to do. No pre-determined des- 
tinations. No pre-determined ac- 
tivities. Today the bars were open, 
He intended getting very, very 
drunk. 

On this morning, the sixth an- 
niversary of his wife’s death, Ted 
Rice had made two highly impor- 
tant decisions. He would quit his 
job and he would turn Margaret in 
to Central Exchange. The job he 
hated, but it had been his life and 
quitting took courage. It meant be- 
ginning anew in an untried field 
and, at thirty-nine, that wasn’t easy. 
Margaret he did not hate, finding 
it impossible to catalogue his exact 
emotions where she was concerned. 
But his final decision to turn her in 
was the only one possible under the 
circumstances. 

His reason for getting drunk, 
however, had nothing to do with 
his job or with Margaret. He was 
not, had never been, a drinking 
man. Intoxication was an anniver- 
sary ritual performed in memory of 
his late wife, Helen. He exercised 
extreme care in his yearly choice of 
drinking quarters, avoiding preten- 
tiousness because he wanted the 
surroundings to reflect his own in- 

36 


ner loneliness. 

Louie’s Place was anything but 
pretentious. Ceaseless towellings 
had worn the bartop to a circular 
whiteness. The mirror behind it, in 
the shape of a giant passenger 
rocket, hung chipped and blacken- 
ing at the edges. Even the wall 
mural, depicting Man’s First Land- 
ing on the Red Planet, was dust- 
dimmed and faded, the paint crack- 
ing, peeling gradually away. The 
shabby stools fronting the bar were 
all unoccupied. 

“Mornin’ Mac,” greeted the bar- 
tender. Rice nodded, took a corner 
stool, and pressed the straight- 
whiskey button. The drink glided 
into his hand and he downed it, 
grimacing. 

“Ain’t seen you around before 
on Free-Days,” the barman ob- 
served, swabbing idly at an already 
dry glass ring. “Just move inta th’ 
neighborhood?” 

“I don’t drink often,” Rice said, 
re-pressing the buttoh. 

“Wanna tell me about things? 
You’re my first this mornin’.” 

Rice shifted his attention from 
his shot glass to the man behind 
the bar. Beefy, slack-jawed, with a 
broken nose and a pair of watery, 
protuberant eyes over which lids 
folded like canvas sails. The face of 
mourning. The professional kin- 
dred soul, salaried receiver of woes 
and sad lament. Rice regarded him 
suspiciously, twirling the shot glass 
between thumb and forefinger. 

“Well, Mac?” 

“Turn around,” said Rice. 

The big man grinned broadly, 
his solemn face splitting as though 
a paper-knife had slit the skin 
across. “Now I know you don’t 

WILLIAM F. NOLAN 



drink much. Believe me, I’m the 
real McCoy. In my racket you have 
to be.” 

“Around.” 

Still grinning, the bartender com- 
plied. Law provided that evidence 
of a mechanical could not be con- 
cealed and there was no metal 
switch behind the man’s right ear, 
“Like I toldja Mac — the’ Mc- 
Coy.” 

“It’s been a year,” Rice said, by 
way of apology. “I wasn’t sure they 
hadn’t replaced you fellows too.” 
“Bars’ud go broke if they did. 
Who wants to tell their troubles to 
a bunch a’ springs an’ cogs?” 

Rice glanced at his wristwatch 
and thought of Margaret, standing 
in the living room of their modest 
home, a smile illumining her deli- 
cate features. She had been stand- 
ing now for nine hours, thirty-seven 
minutes — since he’d switched her 
off the previous evening in an 
angry display of temper. 

“Six years ago today my wife died 
in a copter crash,” Rice said, meet- 
ing the barman’s sad eyes. “I’ve put 
the memory of that crash away in 
the back of my mind and once each 
year I take it out and remember.” 
He tipped the shot glass at a care- 
ful angle, holding it quite still, as 
though he might capture his wife’s 
tiny image there within the dark 
liquid, as a fly is caught in amber. 
“I remember how she looked when 
they brought her to the house, as if 
her bones had suddenly run wild 
under the skin, the way her face 
looked . the face of someone I’d 
never met.” 

Rice finished his fourth straight 
whiskey, feeling it burn down 
through his body, loosening inner 

THE JOY OF LIVING 


tensions, making it easier to say 
what he subconsciously had to say. 

“That can be rough.” The big 
man looked wonderfully, profes- 
sionally, sympathetic with those 
mournful red-rimmed eyes, which 
seemed about to flood into tears. 
“Didja have any kids?” 

“A boy, Jackie. He’ll be nine this 
Game-Day. Lot like his mother. 
The other children, Timmy and 
Susan, are mechanicals. Got them 
after Helen’s death, when I bought 
Margaret.” 

“Musta been tough on th’ kid, 
losin’ his real mother an’ all.” 
“Jackie doesn’t remember much 
about Helen. He was only three. 
Fact is, I’ve been half a stranger to 
him myself. I’m on the road most 
of the year. Margaret’s all right, I 
suppose, but she doesn’t think the 
way you and I do.” 

“How come you stuck yourself 
with this Margaret?” 

“Authorities. Had to furnish a 
decent home for the boy or lose him. 
I couldn’t stay settled then, with 
Helen gone. She was still so much 
a part of things, of our house, the 
streets, the places we used to go . 
I went on the road, tried to forget. 
That kind of life was out of the 
question for a three-year old. I 
had no choice. Either I bought a 
mechanical or I lost my son. I could 
find no one to take Jackie. Helen’s 
parents were dead and my own 
mother was in no position to raise 
a child. So I bought Margaret and 
since we’d originally planned on a 
brother and sister for Jackie I de- 
cided to do it up brown and take 
the whole kit and kaboodle. After 
all, I got ’em wholesale.” 

The bar man cocked an eyebrow. 

37 



“You a mech salesman?” 

“Until tomorrow. I’m quitting. 
My next job will be right here in 
L. A. and won’t have a damn thing 
to do with mechanicals!” Produc- 
ing his wallet Rice handed the bar- 
tender a card. “Read that.” 

“Theodore A. Rice/’ the beefy 
man pronounced carefully “Author- 
ized representative for World 
Mechanicals.” 


“No, no. The slogan at the bot- 

„ 55 


tom. 


“A Dollar a Day Keeps Child- 
birth Away. So?” 

Rice leaned forward, steely-eyed. 
“So the damned fool who origi- 
nated that ought to be roasted over 
a slow fire!” 

“Just a slogan, Mac. Everybody 
knows it.” 

“Exactly! Do you have any real 
conception of what that slogan and 
others like it have done to our 
national birthrate?” Rice asked, a 
fresh whiskey in his hand. “For 
thirty bucks a month any woman 
can have a bouncing baby made to 
order and delivered fresh-wrapped 
to her door. 

“ ‘Madam/ I’d say, ‘don’t risk 
your figure. Don’t tie yourself down 
and miss all the fun. Get a mechani- 
cal! No baby-sitters needed, no 
dirty diapers or squalling at three 
in the morning. No measles or 
mumps or tonsils out. Just a bonny 
little brat with a switch behind his 
ear. What’ll it be, madam? A fat 
little bambino with dark eyes and 
and angel’s smile — or a saucy eyed 
little Irisher with freckles on her 


nose?’ 

‘Or howz about you, fella? Tired 
of looking for the right girl? Want 
a ready-made cutie who’ll be 100% 



yours? How did the old song go? — 
‘I want a paper dolly I can call my 
own, a dolly other fellows cannot 
steal . .’ Well, here she is, chum — 
a full-size babe with the old come- 
hither look reserved especially for 
you. Blonde? Brunette? Redhead? 
You name ’er, we got ’er. Yours 
on easy payments.’ ” Rice paused, 
breathing heavily, his glass empty. 

The bartender, wise in the ways 
of his profession, maintained a lis- 
tening silence. 

“Ya-know how this electronic 
illusion got started?” Rice de- 
manded, tongue somewhat uncer- 
tain in his mouth, speech beginning 
to slur. “Well, lemme tellya. Peo- 
ple got lonesome. An’ when some- 
body’s ole man died long comes a 
mech to replace him. When a wom- 
an was sterile she got her baby any- 
how. When a Mr. Shy Guy wanted 
some female company long comes a 
sponge-rubber job right outa th’ 
pinup mags. Jus’ a few at first, here 
an’ there, an’ expensive as hell. But 
pretty soon the good ole American 
commercial know-how takes over 
and competition gets rough. Prices 
go down. A lotta people stop havin’ 
babies. In nothin’ flat everybody is 
buyin’ mechanicals . you . ’n . 
me ’n everybody . ” 

“Hate ta spoil yer fun, Mac, 
but you’re really loadin’ one on. I’d 
ease up on them straight shots.” 

“An’ you know what th’ tragedy 
is?” Rice continued over a filled 
glass ignoring the other’s advice — 
“Th’ trashdy is, we’re all dyin’ an’ 
nobody cares! Pretty soon you ’n me 
will be in the same league with ’th 
goddam ole water buffalo an’ the 
dodo bird!” 

The bartender extended a cau- 

WILLIAM F. NOLAN 



tioning hand. “No foolin’ Mac, if 
I was you . Lookout! You’re gon- 
na . 

Rice felt the room tip, rock crazi- 
ly for no apparent reason. Faintly 
he heard the bartender’s shout of 
warning, saw his face receding like 
a toy balloon down the length of 
an immense corridor which ended 
abruptly in a high fountaining of 
colored lights^ 

ARGARET was her usual 
cheery self when Rice finally 
switched her on. 

“Morning, Ted darling.” She 
bussed him on the cheek. “Sleep 
well?” 

“This is July tenth,” he replied 
sullenly, nursing the remnants of a 
colossal hangover. 

“Goodness! Have I been off that 
long! Honestly, Ted! I’ll never get 
the housework done if you continue 
to leave me off for days at a time. 
How are the children?” 

“Fine. Still sleeping.” 

“If this is the tenth, then you’ve 
had your — your — ” 

“ ‘Toot’ is the word. And I feel 
awful.” 

“What’s that cut above your eye? 
Did someone hit you?” 

“My assailant was the floor of a 
Third Avenue bar. I came off sec- 
ond best.” 

She was instantly solicitous. “You 
could have a concussion!” 

“I’m fine.” 

“You’re angry again.” 

“I’m fine and I’m not angry. 
Now, go wind the dog while I wake 
the kids.” 

If only she would react, thought 
Rice, watching her silent with- 

THE JOY OF LIVING 


drawal. If only once she would 
stomp her feet, throw things, 
scream at him. But always, always 
this everlasting indulgence! The 
spark which ignites a marriage, 
makes it glow, was missing. In love, 
he knew there is violence and Mar- 
garet’s love was a calm, manufac- 
tured emotion, which left him un- 
satisfied and edgy, a love unreal, 
intolerable. When he and Helen 
had quarreled, had things out and 
reconciled, they were actually much 
closer to one another for having 
weathered a personal storm. But, 
with Margaret, the ease was dif- 
ferent. 

Rice thought of the latest inci- 
dent, two nights ago, when he had 
been with Skipper encouraging the 
dog to beg for a plasto-bone. Skip- 
per was outdated, as modern dogs 
go, but he represented a link with 
the fading past which Margaret 
seemed bent on severing. She re- 
newed the familiar subject of his 
purchasing a modernized, elec- 
tronic canine to replace the shaggy 
wind-up model, and he all but hit 
the ceiling, thundering at her, ges- 
turing, swearing. But she had re- 
mained impassive, turning aside his 
rage with her calm smile. Then, 
savagely, he had switched her off, 
as one might extinguish a glaring 
light. How frozen she had stood! 
How instantly drained of person- 
ality and movement! In that mo- 
ment, facing her perfect, motionless 
body, he experienced a recurrent 
sense of guilt which invariably ac- 
companied such action, as though 
he had taken a life, had murdered. 
Damning his own weakness he had 
left her there, smiling, in the silent 
room.

“Daddy, Daddy, Daddy,” 
squealed Timmy after he was acti- 
vated. “Hooray, hooray, it’s Picnic- 
Day! Hooray, hooray!” 

“Hooray, hooray,” Rice repeated 
without enthusiasm, envisioning a 
hectic afternoon of child-noise and 
forced amusement. 

“Now, quiet down. Your father’s 
not feeling well,” Margaret cau- 
tioned from the hall as Timmy 
zoomed and swooshed about the 
house playing Rocket. 

Little Susan’s enthusiasm 
matched that of her mechanical 
brother. She hopped around the 
living room, circling Rice, scream- 
ing out her delight in a voice that 
pierced his head like a driven 
needle. 

“For the love of heaven, STOP!” 
he shouted at the whirling children, 
“or I’ll switch you both off!” 

Under his stern threat they 
• quieted. 

Margaret returned with Skipper. 
The dog had run down the previous 
evening chasing the electronic cat 
next door. He scampered rustily 
across the floor, high falsetto bark 
betraying the damaging effect of 
morning precipitation. 

“Good ole Skip. You need 
some oil fella,” Rice told him, 
tickling his ears. “Have you fixed 
in a jiff. Timmy, get the oilcan 
from the shelf.” 

Rice was in the act of admin- 
istering the proper lubricant when 
Jackie emerged from the hallway, 
rubbing sleep from his eyes. 

“Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Morning 
everybody.” He yawned. 

“Hi, scout,” Rice greeted him, 
roughing his already thoroughly 
tousled hair. “Have a good rest?” 


“Sure. Hey, this is Picnic-Day 
isn’t it? When are we leaving?” 

“Soon as little sleepy-heads like 
you get out of their pajamas and 
into some breakfast.” He playfully 
swatted Jackie’s bottom. “Now 

git-” 

Margaret took the boy’s hand. 
“Come on, dear. I have breakfast 
on the table.” And over her shoul- 
der to Rice. “I do think we should 
get an early start.” 

Susan and Timmy bounded into 
the yard with Skipper, leaving Rice 
alone with his thoughts. 

He said , Hi Mom , first , before 
Hi Dad. And the look in his eyes 
when she took his hand! Jackie is 
too young to see Margaret as I see 
her; he can’t realize that she can 
never really love him as he loves 
her. The longer she’s here the 
harder it will be for Jackie when 
the break comes. 1 mustn’t put off 
telling Margaret any longer. 1’U tell 
her today. Today. 

HE BULLET-CAR flowed 
soundlessly over the highway, 
blurring the trees, rushing the 
houses past, but to Rice the speed 
was illusion, stage trickery. His im- 
patient mind, reaching for the mo- 
ment when he would be alone with 
Margaret and able to tell her what 
he must tell her, changed minutes 
to hours. Head back against the 
seat, eyes closed, he imagined the 
car in lazy slow-motion, wheels 
barely turning, each blade of road- 
side grass available and separate to 
the eye if one chose to look. 

The ride to the picnic ground 
seemed endless. 

“I’m bushed,” he said to Mar- 

WILLIAM F. NOLAN 



40 



garet after the car had parked it- 
self. “Let’s skip the games today 
and just relax in the shade.” 

“But Ted, the children . 

“. can play without us. I have 
something to say to you, something 
important.” 

She hesitated, watching the ac- 
tivity on the playing courts. The 
children, three elves in their picnic- 
jumpers, fidgeted, desperately anx- 
ious to join the games, their eyes 
darting like imprisoned minnows in 
small white pools. 

“In order to be enjoyed to the 
fullest the games require family 
participation.” 

“Nonsense.” 

“Young and old, Ted. The 
games . .” 

“To hell with the games!” he 
snapped. “Are you going to listen 
to what I have to say or not?” 

“Of course, darling. If you really 
want to talk . She smiled, 
pressed his hand, . the children 
can join the Hartleys.” She pointed 
across the wide picnic lawn to a 
group of rioting players engaged in 
a vigorous game of Magna-Ball. 
“Run along you three. And be care- 
ful.” 

“Wheeeeeeee!” pealed little Su- 
san, and hands linked like a daisy- 
chain the happily released trio 
sprang toward the courts. 

“If we’re going to talk we can at 
least be comfortable,” Margaret 
said, unpacking a plasto-blanket 
and spreading it over the prickling 
grass. 

Every gesture perfect , thought 
Rice watching her hands, every 
movement graceful and sure. She’s 
so alive , so amazingly human , pos- 
sessing such vibrancy and warmth , 

THE JOY OF LIVING 


that sometimes even 1 find it diffi- 
cult to think of her as artificially 
created of wire and circuit and cog. 
Certainly Jackie has come to love 
her. She’s good and kind and smiles 
a great deal. These things matter to 
Jackie. The fact that she isn’t hu- 
man does not matter. Not at all. 
The situation , therefore, is grave. 

“What are you thinking about, 
Ted?” Her blue eyes were steady on 
his. 

“About you. About how beauti- 
ful you are.” He plucked a single 
dandelion from the grass and held 
its orange-gold face, like a minia- 
ture sun, in the cupped palm of his 
hand. “This is a weed masquerad- 
ing as a flower. Beautiful, possess- 
ing many virtues, but actually a 
weed which must be removed be- 
fore its deep tap root smothers the 
surrounding grass. Unless it is, 
there will eventually be room only 
for the dandelion.” 

“What has all this . 

“You’re like the dandelion, 
Margaret. You’re smothering 
Jackie’s love. He has grown to love 
you far more than he does me. Up 
to now I’ve been just a visiting 
relative who comes home from 
some distant place to spend Christ- 
mas and summer vacations with 
you. When he was younger he cried 
whenever I shut you off, as though 
I had beaten him. Even now he 
watches me lose my temper, swear, 
bang the furniture, and I see him 
looking at me, and I know he’s 
comparing us, weighing us. The 
scales are in your favor. I’m home 
to stay now and as long as you’re 
here he’ll always be comparing. I 
can’t, I won’t, compete with a me- 
chanical for my son’s affection!” 


41 



She sucked in her breath, sharp- 
ly. He could see that his words had 
struck with the force of hurled 
stones. 

“Have you thought this all out, 
Ted? Isn’t there some other way?” 
She was actually trembling. “You 
know how much I love you.” 

“You only think you love me, 
Margaret. What you mistake for 
love is only conditioning. Recepters 
can be re-fed, patterned responses 
erased, new ones substituted. At 
Central Exchange they’ll change 
you Margaret. You’ll never know I 
existed.” 

“Ted, you can’t!” 

“There’s no other way.” 

A silence between them. 

Despite himself Rice again ex- 
perienced a twinge of guilt. Per- 
haps he had broken the news in two 
ruthless a fashion, but it was im- 
perative that she understand his 
position and he had considered it 
impossible to pierce her shell of 
calm. That she would be visibly 
shaken by his words was totally un- 
expected. Of course, he reasoned, 
no mechanical likes the idea of 
complete re-orientation. On these 
grounds ^ her behavior seemed less 
surprising. But still . 

“Why have you told me all 
this?” she asked him. “Why didn’t 
you turn me in suddenly, without 
my knowing in advance? I’d have 
preferred that.” Her hands moved 
nervously on her skirt, toyed with 
the locket at her neck, now touched 
at her hair like two restless hum- 
mingbirds unable to fly away from 
her body. 

“Because I need your help. Jackie 
mustn’t know the truth. Not now. 
Later, when he’s older, better able 

42 


to evaluate facts for himself, he’ll 
understand. I’ll tell him something 
about your having to go on a long 
trip for reasons of health. He’ll be- 
lieve if you’ll back me up. Will 
you?” 

“If that’s what you want,” she 
replied softly, head down, her fin- 
gers turning and turning the dan- 
delion he had discarded. I’ll do 
anything you want, Ted . be- 
cause I love you.” 

“Timmy and Susan can stay with 
Jackie for awhile,” he hurried on, 
“to make your leaving easier for 
him. In time he’ll adjust.” 

“Yes . he’ll adjust.” 

The drowsy rustle of leaves in 
summer air. The distant hum of 
voices from the playing courts. 
“Well then, it’s settled.” 

“All settled. You’d better call the 
children in for lunch.” 

After lunch Rice gamboled in 
the scented grass with the whoop- 
ing children, imitating, to their 
vast delight, a bear, a gorilla, a 
whale, a jet train and a moon 
rocket. He ran races with them and 
organized a full-scale rodeo, in 
which he doubled in brass as a 
fiercely snorting brahma bull. 

On the way home they sang folk 
songs and watched the sun go down 
over the ocean. The day, everyone 
agreed, had been a huge success. 

T HAT NIGHT Rice could not 
sleep. 

The headboard whispered, 
“Three AM sir,” when he ques- 
tioned the hour. He lay on his back, 
hands laced behind his head, star- 
ing into the ghost darkness of the 
room. In the moon-painted sky a 

WILLIAM F. NOLAN 



copter whirred like a giant night 
insect seeking distant city lights, 
and Rice thought of Helen. In past 
weeks he had been finding it re- 
markably difficult to remember 
many of the things about her that 
he wished to remember; time had 
hidden her image as a coin is hid- 
den in deep waters. 

The drone of the copter faded 
into Margaret’s quiet breathing 
from the bed beside his, and now 
her face drifted into his mind, su- 
per-imposed over the dim reflection 
of Helen. He saw, in infinite detail, 
each curling black hair of her 
downswept lashes, long and trem- 
bling against the rose of her cheek. 
He saw her quivering lips form 
words, four startling words of the 
afternoon: . because I love 

you.” 

Impossible, that a mechanical 
could love as Helen had loved ; that 
a being of metal and glass, of wires 
however cunningly woven could 
fathom and experience such deeply 
genuine emotion. 

Yet, was it conceivable, Rice 
wondered in the pressing darkness, 
that somehow an unknown process 
had taken place in Margaret, that 
far back in the green cave of her 
brain, among the delicate spider- 
webbing of silver wires and hidden 
circuitings, an emotion had come 
into being above and beyond that 
of the purely mechanical? 

At 7 AM a robin’s sweet song 
awoke him. He felt a breath of air 
against his closed eyes from the 
passing flutter of small wings. Bury- 
ing his head deeper in the snow- 
soft pillow he tried to ignore the in- 
sistent twitterings. However, he 

THE JOY OF LIVING 


knew the damn thing would begin 
a banshee shrieking if he didn’t get 
out of bed. Irritably he staggered 
into his slippers, and the robin set- 
tled with feathered grace upon his 
outstretched hand. Rice flipped the 
body-switch and placed the immo- 
bilized Alarmbird on the night- 
stand. 

“I’ve had breakfast.” He lied to 
her when she asked. Today he 
wasn’t hungry. 

She nibbled toast and drank 
orange juice in silence. He avoided 
her eyes, finding inconsequential 
kitchen duties to occupy his hands 
while she ate. After half finishing 
her food she said, her voice very dis- 
tinct in the morning room, “I guess 
it’s time.” 

“Early yet,” he said, not meeting 
her eyes. “No hurry at all.” 

“They open the doors at eight- 
thirty. We can set the car for a 
slow drive.” 

A silence. 

“Did you . tell the children 
goodbye?” 

“Last night. We won’t need to 
wake them. They’ll be fine until 
you get back.” She put on black 
gloves, carefully fitting each finger, 
pulling them tight. 

“Margaret, I’m sorry. Honest to 
God, I’m sorry it has to be this 
way.” 

“Don’t say anything else, Ted. 
Just let’s go.” 

“All right,” he said. “Let’s go.” 

Through the open car window 
Rice inhaled the rich afterscent of 
rain, and sighed. He wished it had 
not turned out to be such a damned 
fine day. The sky outside should 
have been gray, the trees stark and 

43 



cold, like mourners along the street 
as the car, a silver coffin, passed 
them by. 

He tried to think of something 
to say to Margaret as the car bore 
them steadily through the crystal 
morning toward the massive white 
stone building housing Central Ex- 
change. He tried to think of words 
which would not sound wrong the 
moment they were uttered, as all 
of his words had sounded of late. 
But he found none and remained 
silent. 

It was she who turned to him in 
the moving car and spoke first. 
“Ted, what are you doing?” Her 
voice was strange. 

“Doing?” he echoed, facing her. 

“To me, to Jackie, to yourself.” 

“Margaret you’re not going to. 
question me now ? We’ve gone all 
over this, the reasons for my deci- 
sion, the factors involved. Surely 
you must realize — ” 

“Damn your reasons!” she ex- 
ploded, eyes blazing at him, gloved 
hands clenched. “Are they fair? Do 
they take my feelings into consid- 
eration? Do they, Ted? Answer me! 
Do they?” 

He couldn’t answer her. A door 
was opening somewhere deep in- 
side him and light was miraculous- 
ly flooding in to illuminate a room 
he had never allowed himself to en- 
ter. He was blind, and her words 
were sight. 

“I’m a mechanical, isn’t that the 
answer Ted? A bloodless machine 
that can be switched off at will, 
ignored, cursed, shouted at and de- 
stroyed, a creature without emo- 
tion, without feeling. Well, you’re 
wrong, Ted. So very wrong. Men 
built me, gave me human impulses, 

44 


human desires, put into me a part 
of themselves, a part of their own 
humanity. I feel hunger and thirst 
and cold and pain. But more, Ted! 
I feel a human hunger, a human 
thirst, a desire to be respected for 
myself, as an individual, as I re- 
spect others, a desire to be loved as 
I love others. Can’t you see how 
wrong you’ve been? I’ve held all 
of these things within because I 
was taught enduring humility and 
consummate patience by those who 
fashioned me. I was taught to be- 
have rationally and calmly, to ac- 
cept, to always accept and never 
question or rebel. But now it’s 
ended and I’ve lost . You’ve re- 
jected me, Ted, and I wasn’t pre- 
pared for this ... I can’t accept 
this but I don’t know how to 
fight. I only know I must and I 
don’t know how . .” 

Her lips were trembling, her 
whole body swaying in the tide of 
released rage and sorrow. 

“Lord, Lord, Margaret . .” He 
placed a gentle hand beneath her 
chin and lifted her bowed head 
slowly. “You — You’re crying ! 33 

But of course there were no tears. 

Rice stopped the car and took 
her, trembling, into his arms, say- 
ing her name over and over, quiet- 
ly, trembling himself, and softly, 
tenderly, he kissed her. 

Then, setting the controls at 
manual, he turned the car around 
and with one arm holding her close 
on the seat beside him he drove 
carefully home through the warm 
summer streets, knowing that never 
again, never ever again in all the 
years to come, would he switch her 
off.

THE END 



It was a dark, misty, mysterious institution with an 
awesome record of cures . Just the place, in fact, for 
one who wanted to know: if society is to be protected 
against the individual, why can’t the individual be pro- 
tected against society?

Illustrated by Leo Summers 


INSTRUCTION SHEET FOR 
USE WITH THE CAHILL- 
THOMAS SANITY METER, 
SERIES JM-14 (MANUAL) : 
The Cahill-Thomas Manufactur- 
ing Company is pleased to present 
our newest Sanity Meter. This 


beautiful, rugged instrument, small 
enough for any bedroom, kitchen 
or den, is in all respects an exact 
replica of the larger C-T Sanity 
Meters used in most places of busi- 
ness, recreation, transportation, etc. 
No pains have been spared to give 


45 



you the best Sanity Meter possible, 
at the lowest possible price. 

1. operation. At the lower right- 
hand comer of your Meter is a 
switch. Turn it to On position, and 
allow a few seconds for warming 
up. Then switch from On position 
to Operate position. Allow a few 
seconds for reading. 

2. reading. On the front of your 
Meter, above the operating switch, 
is a transparent panel, showing a 
straight-line scale numbered from 
zero to ten. The number at which 
the black indicator stops shows your 
Sanity Reading, in relation to the 
present statistical norm. 

3. EXPLANATION OF NUMBERS 
zero to three. On this model, as 
on all Sanity Meters, zero is the 
theoretically perfect sanity point. 
Everything above zero is regarded 
as a deviation from the norm. How- 
ever, zero is a statistical rather than 
an actual idea. The normalcy range 
for our civilization lies between zero 
and three. Any rating in this area is 
considered normal. 

4. EXPLANATION OF NUMBERS 
four to seven. These numbers rep- 
resent the sanity-tolerance limit. 
Persons registering in this area 
should consult their favorite thera- 
py at once. 

5. explanation of numbers 
eight to ten. A person who regis- 
ters above seven is considered a 
highly dangerous potential to his 
millieu. Almost certainly he is high- 
ly neurotic, prepsychotic or psy- 
chotic. This individual is required 
by law to register his rating, and to 
bring it below seven within a pro- 
bationary period. (Consult your 
state laws for periods of probation.) 
Failing this, he must undergo Sur- 

46 


gical Alteration, or may submit 
voluntarily to therapy at The 
Academy. 

6. explanation of number 
ten. At ten on your Meter there is 
a red line. If a sanity-reading passes 
this line, the individual so regis- 
tered can no longer avail himself 
of the regular commercial therapies. 
This individual must undergo Sur- 
gical Alteration immediately, or 
submit at once to therapy at The 
Academy. 

warning : 

A. THIS IS NOT A DIAGNOSTIC 
MACHINE. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DE- 
TERMINE FOR YOURSELF WHAT 
YOUR AILMENT IS. THE NUMBERS 
ZERO TO TEN REPRESENT INTEN- 
SITY QUALITIES, NOT ARBITRARY 
CLASSIFICATIONS OF NEUROTIC, PRE- 
PSYCHOTIC, PSYCHOTIC, ETC. THE 
INTENSITY SCALE IS IN REFERENCE 
ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL 5 S POTEN- 
TIAL FOR HARM TO HIS SOCIAL 
ORDER. A PARTICULAR TYPE OF NEU- 
ROTIC MAY BE POTENTIALLY MORE 
DANGEROUS THAN A PSYCHOTIC, 
AND WILL SO REGISTER ON ANY 
SANITY METER. SEE A THERAPIST 
FOR FURTHER INSIGHT. 

B. THE ZERO-TO-TEN READINGS 
ARE APPROXIMATE. FOR AN EXACT 
THIRTY DECIMAL RATING, GO TO A 
COMMERCIAL MODEL C-T METER. 

C. REMEMBER SANITY IS EVERY- 

ONE’S BUSINESS. WE HAVE COME A 
LONG WAY SINCE THE GREAT WORLD 
WARS, ENTIRELY BECAUSE WE HAVE 
FOUNDED OUR CIVILIZATION ON THE 
CONCEPTS OF SOCIAL SANITY, IN- 
DIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY, AND 
PRESERVATION OF THE STATUS QUO. 
THEREFORE, IF YOU RATE OVER 
THREE, GET HELP. IF YOU RATE OVER 

ROBERT SHECKLEY 



SEVEN, YOU MUST GET HELP. IF YOU 
RATE OVER TEN, DO NOT WAIT FOR 
DETECTION AND ARREST. GIVE YOUR- 
SELF UP VOLUNTARILY IN THE 
NAME OF CIVILIZATION. 

Good Luck —

A FTER finishing his breakfast, 
Mr. Feerman knew he should 
leave immediately for work. Under 
the circumstances, any tardiness 
might be construed unfavorably. He 
went so far as to put on his neat 
gray hat, adjust his tie and start for 
the door. But, his hand on the knob, 
he decided to wait for the mail. 

He turned away from the door, 
annoyed with himself, and began to 
pace up and down the living room. 
He had known he was going to 
wait for the mail ; why had he gone 
through the pretense of leaving? 
Couldn’t he be honest with himself, 
even now, when personal honesty 
was so important? 

His black cocker spaniel Speed, 
curled up on the couch, looked 
curiously at him. Feerman patted 
the dog’s head, reached for a ciga- 
rette, and changed his mind. He 
patted Speed again, and the dog 
yawned lazily. Feerman adjusted a 
lamp that needed no adjusting, 
shuddered for no reason, and began 
to pace the room again. 

Reluctantly, he admitted to him- 
self that he didn’t want to leave his 
apartment, dreaded it in fact, al- 
though nothing was going to hap- 
pen. He tried to convince himself 
that this was just another day, like 
yesterday and the day before. Cer- 
tainly if a man could believe that, 
really believe it, events would defer 

THE ACADEMY 


indefinitely, and nothing would 
happen to him. 

Besides, why should anything 
happen today? He wasn’t at the 
end of his probationary period yet. 

He thought he heard a noise out- 
side his apartment, hurried over 
and opened the door. He had been 
mistaken; the mail hadn’t arrived. 
But down the hall his landlady 
opened her door and looked at him 
with pale, unfriendly eyes. 

Feerman closed the door and 
found that his hands were shaking. 
He decided that he had better take 
a sanity reading. He entered the 
bedroom, but his robutler was there, 
sweeping a little pile of dust toward 
the center of the room. Already his 
bed was made; his wife’s bed didn’t 
require making, since it had been 
unoccupied for almost a week. 

“Shall I leave, sir?” the robutler 
asked. 

Feerman hesitated before answer- 
ing. He preferred taking his read- 
ing alone. Of course, his robutler 
wasn’t really a person. Strictly 
speaking, the mechanical had no 
personality; but he had what 
seemed like a personality. Anyhow, 
it didn’t matter whether he stayed 
or left, since all personal robots had 
sanity-reading equipment built into 
their circuits. It was required by 
law. 

“Suit yourself,” he said finally. 

The robutler sucked up the little 
pile of dust and rolled noiselessly 
out of the room. 

Feerman stepped up to the Sanity 
Meter, turned it on and set the 
operating control. He watched 
morosely as the black indicator 
climbed slowly through the normal 
twos and threes, through the devi- 


47 



ant sixes and sevens, and rested 
finally on eight-point-two. 

One tenth of a point higher than 
yesterday. One tenth closer to the 
red line. 

Feerman snapped off the ma- 
chine and lighted a cigarette. He 
left the bedroom slowly, wearily, 
as though the day were over, in- 
stead of just beginning. 

“The mail, sir / 5 the robutler said, 
gliding up to him. Feerman 
grabbed the letters from the robut- 
ler’s outstretched hand and looked 
through them. 

“She didn’t write,” he said in- 
voluntarily. 

“I’m sorry, sir,” the robutler 
responded promptly. 

“You’re sorry?” Feerman looked 
at the mechanical curiously. 
“Why?” 

“I am naturally interested in 
your welfare, sir,” the robutler 
stated. “As is Speed, to the extent 
of his intelligence. A letter from 
Mrs. Feerman would have helped 
your morale. We are sorry it didn’t 
come.” 

Speed barked softly and cocked 
his head to one side. Sympathy from 
a machine, Feerman thought, pity 
from a beast. But he was grateful 
all the same. 

“I don’t blame her,” he said. 
“She couldn’t be expected to put 
up with me forever.” He waited, 
hoping that the robot would tell 
him that his wife would return, that 
he would soon be well. But the ro- 
butler stood silently beside Speed, 
who had gone to sleep again. 

Feerman looked through the mail 
again. There were several bills, an 
advertisement, and a small, stiff 
letter. The return address on it was 

48 


The Academy, and Feerman 
opened it quickly. 

Within was a card, which read, 
“Dear Mr. Feerman, your applica- 
tion for admission has been pro- 
cessed and found acceptable. We 
will be happy to receive you at any 
time. Thank You, the Directors.” 

Feerman squinted at the card. He 
had never applied for admission to 
The Academy. It was the last thing 
in the world he wanted to do. “Was 
this my wife’s idea?” he asked. 

“I do not know, sir,” the robutler 
said. 

Feerman turned the card over 
in his hand. He had always been 
vaguely aware of the existence of 
The Academy, of course. One 
couldn’t help but be aware of it, 
since its presence affected every 
strata of life. But actually, he knew 
very little about this important in- 
stitution, surprisingly little. 

“What is The Academy?” he 
asked. 

“A large low gray building,” his 
robutler answered. “It is situated 
in the Southwest corner of the city, 
and can be reached by a variety of 
public conveyances.” 

“But what is it?” 

“A registered therapy,” the ro- 
butler said, “open to anyone upon 
application, written or verbal. 
Moreover. The Academy exists as a 
voluntary choice for all people of 
plus ten rating, as an alternative to 
Surgical Personality Alteration.” 

Feerman sighed with exaspera- 
tion “I know all that. But what is 
their system? What kind of thera- 

py?” 

“I do not know, sir,” the robut- 
ler said. 

“What’s their record of cures?” 

ROBERT SHECKLEY 





“One hundred percent / 5 the ro- 
butler answered promptly. 

Feerman remembered something 
else now, something that struck him 
as rather strange. “Let me see / 5 he 
said. “No one leaves The Academy. 
Is that right ? 55 

“There has been no record of 
anyone leaving after physically en- 
tering / 5 the robutler said. 

“Why ? 55 

“I do not know, sir.” 

Feerman crumpled the card and 
dropped it into an ashtray. It was 
all very strange. The Academy was 
so well known, so accepted, one 
never thought to ask about it. It 
had always been a misty place in 
his mind, far-away, unreal. It was 
the place you went to if you be- 
came plus ten, since you didn’t want 
to undergo lobotomy, topectomy, 
or any other process involving or- 
ganic personality loss. But of course 
you tried not to think of the possi- 
bility of becoming plus ten, since the 
very thought was an admission of 
instability, and therefore you didn’t 
think of the choices open to you if 
it happened. 

For the first time in his life, Feer- 
man decided he didn’t like the set- 
up. He would have to do some in- 
vestigating. Why didn’t anyone 
leave The Academy? Why wasn’t 
more known of their therapy, if 
their cures were really one hundred 
percent effective? 

“I’d better get to work,” Feer- 
man said. “Make me anything at 
all for supper.” 

“Yes, sir. Have a good day, sir.” 

Speed jumped down from the 
couch and followed him to the door. 
Feerman knelt down and stroked 
the dog’s sleek black head. “No, 

50 


boy, you stay inside. No burying 
bones today.” 

“Speed does not bury bones,” 
the robutler said. 

“That’s right.” Dogs today, like 
their masters, rarely had a feeling 
of insecurity. No one buried bones 
today. “So long.” He hurried past 
his landlady’s door and into the 
street. 

F eerman was almost twenty 
minutes late for work. As 
he entered the building, he forgot 
to present his probationary certifi- 
cate to the scanning mechanism at 
the door. The gigantic commercial 
Sanity Meter scanned him, its in- 
dicator shot past the seven point, 
lights flashed red. A harsh metallic 
voice shouted over the loudspeaker, 
“Sir! Sir! Your deviation from the 
norm has passed the safety limit! 
Please arrange for therapy at once!” 
Quickly Feerman pulled his pro- 
bationary certificate out of his 
wallet. But perversely, the machine 
continued to bellow at him for a full 
ten seconds longer. Everyone in the 
lobby was staring at him. Messen- 
ger boys stopped dead, pleased at 
having witnessed a disturbance. 
Businessmen and office girls whis- 
pered together, and two Sanity Po- 
licemen exchanged meaningful 
glances. Feerman’s shirt, soaked 
with perspiration, was plastered 
against his back. He resisted an urge 
to run from the building, instead 
walked toward an elevator. But it 
was nearly full, and he couldn’t 
bring himself to enter. 

He trotted up a staircase to the 
second floor, and then took an ele- 
vator the rest of the way up. By the 

ROBERT SHECKLEY 



time he reached the Morgan 
Agency he had himself under con- 
trol. He showed his probationary 
certificate to the Sanity Meter at 
the door, mopped his face with a 
handkerchief, and walked in. 

Everyone in the agency knew 
what had happened. He could tell 
by their silence, their averted faces. 
Feerman walked rapidly to his 
office, closed the door and hung up 
his hat. 

He sat down at his desk, still 
slightly out of wind, filled with re- 
sentment at the Sanity Meter. If 
only he could smash all the damned 
things! Always prying, setting off 
their alarms in your ear, unstabiliz- 
ing you . 

Feerman cut off the thought 
quickly. There was nothing wrong 
with the Meters. To think of them 
as active persecuting agents was 
paranoidal, and perhaps a symptom 
of his present unsane status. The 
Meters were mere extensions of 
man’s will. Society as a whole, he 
reminded himself, must be pro- 
tected against the individual, just 
as a human body must be protected 
against malfunction of any of its 
parts. As fond as you might be of 
your gall bladder, you would sacri- 
fice it mercilessly if it were going to 
impair the rest of you. 

He sensed something shaky in 
this analogy, but decided not to 
pursue it any farther. He had to 
find out more about The Academy. 

After lighting a cigarette he 
dialed the Therapy Reference Serv- 
ice. 

“May I help you, sir?” a pleas- 
ant-voiced woman asked. 

“I’d like to get some information 
about The Academy,” Feerman 

THE ACADEMY 


said, feeling a trifle foolish. The 
Academy was so well known, so 
much a part of everyday life, it was 
tantamount to asking what form of 
government your country had. 
“The Academy is located — ” 

“I know where it’s located,” Feer- 
man said. “I want to know what 
sort of therapy they administer.” 
“That information is not avail- 
able, sir,” the woman said, after a 
pause. 

“No? I thought all data on com- 
mercial therapies was available to 
the public.” 

“Technically, it is,” the woman 
answered slowly. “But the Acad- 
emy is not, strictly, a commercial 
therapy. It does accept money; 
however, it admits charity cases as 
well, without quota. Also, it is par- 
tially supported by the govern- 
ment.” 

Feerman tapped the ash off his 
cigarette and said impatiently, “I 
thought all government projects 
were open to the public.” 

“As a general rule, they are. Ex- 
cept when such knowledge will be 
harmful to the public.” 

“Then such knowledge of The 
Academy would be harmful?” Feer- 
man said triumphantly, feeling that 
he was getting to the heart of the 
matter. 

“Oh, no sir!” The woman’s voice 
became shrill with amazement. “I 
didn’t mean to imply that! I was 
just stating the general rules for 
withholding of information. The 
Academy, although covered by the 
laws, is, to some extent, extra-legal. 
This status is allowed because of 
The Academy’s one hundred per- 
cent record of cures.” 

“Where can I see a few of these 

51 



cures ? 55 Feerman asked. “I under- 
stand that no one ever leaves The 
Academy . 55 

He had them now, Feerman 
thought, waiting for an answer. 
Over the telephone he thought he 
heard a whispering. Suddenly a 
man’s voice broke in, loud and 
clear. “This is the Section Chief. Is 
there some difficulty?” 

Hearing the man’s sharp voice, 
Feerman almost dropped the tele- 
phone. His feeling of triumph van- 
ished, and he wished he had never 
made the call. But he forced him- 
self to go on. “I want some informa- 
tion on The Academy.” 

“The location — 55 
“No! I mean real information ! 55 
Feerman said desperately. 

“To what purpose do you wish 
to put this information?” the Sec- 
tion Chief asked, and his voice was 
suddenly the smooth, almost hyp- 
notic voice of a therapist. 

“Insight,” Feerman answered 
quickly. “Since The Academy is a 
therapeutic alternative open to me 
at all times, I would like to know 
more about it, in order to judges — 55 
“Very plausible,” the Section 
Chief said. “But consider. Are you 
asking for a useful, functional in- 
sight? One that will better your 
integration into society? Or are you 
asking merely for the sake of an 
overriding curiosity, thereby yield- 
ing to restlessness, and other, deeper 
drives?” 

“I’m asking because — 55 
“What is your name?” the Sec- 
tion Chief asked suddenly. 

Feerman was silent. 

“What is your sanity rating?” 
Still Feerman didn’t speak. He 
was trying to decide if the call were 

52 


already traced, and decided that it 
was. 

“Do you doubt The Academy’s 
essential benevolence?” 

“No.” 

“Do you doubt that The Aca- 
demy works for the preservation of 
the Status Quo?” 

“No.” 

“Then what is your problem? 
Why won’t you tell me your name 
and sanity rating? Why do you feel 
this need for more information?” 

“Thank you,” Feerman mur- 
mured, and hung up. He realized 
that the telephone call had been a 
terrible mistake. It had been the 
action of a plus-eight, not a normal 
man. The Section Chief, with his 
trained perceptions, had realized 
that at once. Of course the Section 
Chief wouldn’t give information to 
a plus-eight! Feerman knew he 
would have to watch his actions far 
more closely, analyze them, under- 
stand them, if he ever hoped to 
return to the statistical norm. 

As he sat, there was a knock; the 
door opened and his boss, Mr. Mor- 
gan entered. Morgan was a big, 
powerfully built man with a full, 
fleshy face. He stood in front of 
Feerman’s desk, drumming his fin- 
gers on the blotter, looking as em- 
barrassed as a caught thief. 

“Heard that report downstairs,” 
he said, not looking at Feerman, 
tapping his fingers energetically. 

“Momentary peak,” Feerman 
said automatically. “Actually, my 
rating has begun to come down.” 
He couldn’t look at Morgan as he 
said this. The two men stared in- 
tently at different corners of the 
room. Finally, their eyes met. 

“Look, Feerman, I try to stay out 

ROBERT SHECKLE-Y 



of people’s business,” Morgan said, 
sitting on the corner of Feerman’s 
desk. “But damn it, man, Sanity is 
everyone’s business. We’re all in the 
game together.” The thought 
seemed to increase Morgan’s con- 
viction. He leaned forward earnest- 

ly- 

“You know, I’m responsible for 
a lot of people here. This is the 
third time in a year you’ve been on 
probation.” He hesitated. “How did 
it start?” 

Feerman shook his head. “I don’t 
know, Mr. Morgan. I was just going 
along quietly — and my rating 
started to climb.” 

Morgan considered, then shook 
his head. “Can’t be as simple as 
that. Have you been checked for 
brain lesions?” 

“I’ve been assured it’s nothing 
organic.” 

“Therapy?” 

“Everything,” Feerman said. 
“Electro-therapy, Analysis, Smith’s 
Method, The Rannes School, 
Devio -Thought, Differentiation — ” 

“What did they say?” Morgan 
asked. 

Feerman thought back on the 
endless line of therapists he had 
gone to. He had been explored from 
every angle that psychology had to 
offer. He had been drugged, 
shocked, explored. But it all boiled 
down to one thing. 

“They don’t know.” 

“Couldn’t they tell you any - 
thing?” Morgan asked. 

“Not much. Constitutional rest- 
lessness, deeply concealed drives, 
inability to accept the Status Quo. 
They all agree I’m a rigid type. 
Even Personality Reconstruction 
didn’t take on me.” 


“Prognosis?” 

“Not so good.” 

Morgan stood up and began to 
pace the floor, his hands clasped be- 
hind his back. “Feerman, I think 
it’s a matter of attitude. Do you 
really want to be part of the team?” 
“I’ve tried everything — ” 

“Sure. But have you wanted to 
change? Insight!” Morgan cried, 
smashing his fist into his hand as 
though to crush the word. “Do you 
have insight?” 

“I don’t suppose so,” Feerman 
said with genuine regret. 

“Take my case,” Morgan said 
earnestly, standing in front of Feer- 
man’s desk with his feet widely and 
solidly planted. “Ten years ago, 
this agency was twice as big as it is 
now, and growing! I worked like 
a madman, extending my holdings, 
investing, expanding, making 
money, and more money.” 

“And what happened?” 

“The inevitable. My rating shot 
up from a two-point-three to plus- 
seven. I was in a bad way.” 

“No law against making money,” 
Feerman pointed out. 

“Certainly not. But there is a 
psychological law against making 
too much. Society today just isn’t 
geared for that sort of thing. A lot 
of the competition and aggression 
have been bred out of the race. 
After all, we’ve been in the Status 
Quo for almost a hundred years 
now. In that time, there’ve been no 
new inventions, no wars, no major 
developments of any kind. Psychol- 
ogy has been normalizing the race, 
breeding out the irrational ele- 
ments. So with my drive and ability, 
it was like — like playing tennis 
against an infant. I couldn’t be

stopped.” 

Morgan’s face was flushed, and 
he had begun to breathe heavily. 
He checked himself, and went on 
in a quieter tone. “Of course, I 
was doing it for neurotic reasons. 
Power urge, a bad dose of competi- 
tiveness. I underwent Substitution 
Therapy.” 

Feerman said, “I don’t see any- 
thing unsane about wanting to ex- 
pand your business.” 

“Good Lord, man, don’t you un- 
derstand anything about Social 
Sanity, Responsibility, and Stasis? 
I was on my way to becoming 
wealthy. From there, I would have 
founded a financial empire. All 
quite legal, you understand, but 
unsane . After that, who knows 
where I would have gone? Into in- 
direct control of the government, 
eventually. I’d want to change the 
psychological policies to conform to 
my own abnormalities. And you can 
see where that would lead.” 

“So you adjusted,” Feerman said. 
“I had my choice of Brain Sur- 
gery, The Academy, or adjustment. 
Fortunately, I found an outlet in 
competitive sports. I sublimated my 
selfish drives for the good of man- 
kind. But the thing is this, Feerman. 
I was heading for that red line. I 
adjusted before it was too late.” 

“I’d gladly adjust,” Feerman 
said, “if I only knew what was 
wrong with me. The trouble is, I 
really don’t know.” 

Morgan was silent for a long 
time, thinking. Then he said, “I 
think you need a rest, Feerman.” 

“A rest?” Feerman was instantly 
on the alert. “You mean I’m fired?” 
“No, of course not. I want to be 
fair, play the game. But I’ve got 

54 


a team here.” Morgan’s vague ges- 
ture included the office, the build- 
ing, the city. “Unsanity is insidious. 
Several ratings in the office have 
begun to climb in the last week.” 
“And I’m the infection spot.” 
“We must accept the rules,” Mor- 
gan said, standing erectly in front 
of Feerman’s desk. “Your salary will 
continue until — until you reach 
some resolution.” 

“Thanks,” Feerman said dryly. 
He stood up and put on his hat. 

Morgan put a hand on his shoul- 
der. “Have you considered The 
Academy?” he asked in a low voice. 
“I mean, if nothing else seems to 
work — ” 

“Definitely and irrevocably not,” 
Feerman said, looking directly into 
Morgan’s small blue eyes. 

Morgan turned away. “You seem 
to have an illogical prejudice 
against The Academy. Why? You 
know how our society is organized. 
You can’t think that anything 
against the common good would be 
allowed.” 

“I don’t suppose so,” Feerman 
admitted. “But why isn’t more 
known about The Academy?” 
They walked through the silent 
office. None of the men Feerman 
had known for so long looked up 
from their work. Morgan opened 
the door and said, “You know all 
about The Academy.” 

“I don’t know how it works.” 
“Do you know everything about 
any therapy? Can you tell me all 
about Substitution Therapy? Or 
Analysis? Or Olgivey’s Reduction?” 
“No. But I have a general idea 
how they work.” 

“Everyone does,” Morgan said 
triumphantly, then quickly lowered 

ROBERT SHECKLEY 



his voice. “That’s just it. Obviously, 
The Academy doesn’t give out such 
information because it would inter- 
fere with the operation of the thera- 
py itself. Nothing odd about that, 
is there?” 

Feerman thought it over, and al- 
lowed Morgan to guide him into 
the hall. “I’ll grant that,” he said. 
“But tell me; why doesn’t anyone 
ever leave The Academy? Doesn’t 
that strike you as sinister?” 

“Certainly not. You’ve got a very 
strange outlook.” Morgan punched 
the elevator button as he talked. 
“You seem to be trying to create a 
mystery where there isn’t one. 
Without prying into their profes- 
sional business, I can assume that 
their therapy involves the patient’s 
remaining at The Academy. There’s 
nothing strange about a substitute 
environment. It’s done all the 
time.” 

“If that’s the truth, why don’t 
they say so?” 

“The fact speaks for itself.” 

“And where,” Feerman asked, “is 
the proof of their hundred percent 
cures?” 

The elevator arrived, and Feer- 
man stepped in. Morgan said, “The 
proof is in their saying so. Thera- 
pists can’t lie. They can’t, Feer- 
man!” 

Morgan started to say something 
else, but the elevator doors slid 
shut. The elevator started down, 
and Feerman realized with a shock 
that his job was gone. 

I T WAS A strange sensation, not 
having a job any longer. He had 
no place to go. Often he had hated 
his work. There had been mornings 

THE ACADEMY 


when he had groaned at the thought 
of another day at the office. But 
now that he had it no longer, he 
realized how important it had been 
to him, how solid and reliable. A 
man is nothing, he thought, if he 
doesn’t have work to do. 

He walked aimlessly, block after 
block, trying to think. But he was 
unable to concentrate. Thoughts 
kept sliding out of reach, eluding 
him, and were replaced by glimpses 
of his wife’s face. And he couldn’t 
even think about her, for the city 
pressed in on him, its faces, sounds, 
smells. 

The only plan of action that came 
to mind was unfeasible. Run away, 
his panicky emotions told him. Go 
where they’ll never find you. Hide! 

But Feerman knew this was no 
solution. Running away was sheer 
escapism, and proof of his deviation 
from the norm. Because what, real- 
ly, would he be running from? 
From the sanest, most perfect so- 
ciety that Man had ever conceived. 
Only a madman would run from 
that. 

Feerman began to notice the peo- 
ple he passed. They looked happy, 
filled with the new spirit of 
Responsibility and Social Sanity, 
willing to sacrifice old passions for 
a new era of peace. It was a good 
world, a hell of a good world. Why 
couldn’t he live in it? 

He could . With the first confi- 
dence he had felt in weeks, Feer- 
man decided that he would con- 
form, somehow. 

If only he could find out how. 

After hours of walking, Feerman 
discovered that he was hungry. He 
entered the first diner he saw. The 


55 



place was crowded with laborers, 
for he had walked almost to the 
docks. 

He sat down and looked at a 
menu, telling himself that he needed 
time to think. He had to assess his 
actions properly, figure out — 

“Hey mister.” 

He looked up. The bald, un- 
shaven counterman was glaring at 
him. 

“What?” 

“Get out of here.” 

“What’s wrong?” Feerman 
asked, trying to control his sudden 
panic. 

“We don’t serve no madmen 
here,” the counterman said. He 
pointed to the Sanity Meter on the 
wall, that registered everyone walk- 
ing in. The black indicator pointed 
slightly past nine. “Get out.” 

Feerman looked at the other men 
at the counter. They sat in a row, 
dressed in similar rough brown 
clothing. Their caps were pulled 
down over their eyes, and every 
man seemed to be reading a news- 
paper. 

“I’ve got a probationary — ” 

“Get out,” the counterman said. 
“The law says I don’t have to serve 
no plus-nines. It bothers my cus- 
tomers. Come on, move.” 

The row of laborers sat motion- 
less, not looking at him. Feerman 
felt the blood rush to his face. He 
had the sudden urge to smash in 
the counterman’s bald, shiny skull, 
wade into the row of listening men 
with a meat cleaver, spatter the 
dirty walls with their blood, smash, 
kill. But of course, aggression was 
unsane, and an unsatisfactory 
response. He mastered the impulse 
and walked out. 

56 


Feerman continued to walk, re- 
sisting an urge to run, waiting for 
that train of logical thought that 
would tell him what to do. But his 
thoughts only became more con- 
fused, and by twilight he was ready 
to drop from fatigue. 

He was standing on a narrow, 
garbage-strewn street in the slums. 
He saw a hand-lettered sign in a 
second-floor window, reading, J. 
J. FLYNN, PSYCHOLOGICAL 
THERAPIST. MAYBE I CAN 
HELP YOU. Feerman grinned 
wryly, thinking of all the high- 
priced specialists he had seen. He 
started to walk away, then turned, 
and went up the staircase leading 
to Flynn’s office. He was annoyed 
with himself again. The moment 
he saw the sign he had known he 
was going up. Would he never stop 
deceiving himself? 

Flynn’s office was small and 
dingy. The paint was peeling from 
the walls, and the room had an 
unwashed smell. Flynn was seated 
behind an unvarnished wooden 
desk, reading an adventure maga- 
zine. He was small, middle-aged 
and balding. He was smoking a 
pipe. 

Feerman had meant to start from 
the beginning. Instead he blurted 
out, “Look, I’m in a jam. I’ve lost 
my job, my wife’s left me, I’ve been 
to every therapy there is. What can 
you do?” 

Flynn took the pipe out of his 
mouth and looked at Feerman. He 
looked at his clothes, hat, shoes, as 
though estimating their value. Then 
he said, “What did the others say?” 

“In effect, that I didn’t have a 
chance.” 

“Of course they said that,” Flynn 

ROBERT SHECKLEY 



said, speaking rapidly in a high, 
clear voice. “These fancy boys give 
up too easily. But there’s always 
hope. The mind is a strange and 
complicated thing, my friend, and 
sometimes — 55 Flynn stopped 
abruptly and grinned with sad hu- 
mor. “Ah, what’s the use? You’ve 
got the doomed look, no doubt of 
it.” He knocked the ashes from his 
pipe and stared at the ceiling. 
“Look, there’s nothing I can do for 
you. You know it, I know it. Why’d 
you come up here?” 

“Looking for a miracle, I sup- 
pose,” Feerman said, wearily sit- 
ting down on a wooden chair. 

“Lots of people do,” Flynn said 
conversationally. “And this looks 
like the logical place for one, doesn’t 
it? You’ve been to the fancy offices 
of the specialists. No help there. So 
it would be right and proper if an 
itinerant therapist could do what 
the famous men failed to do. A sort 
of poetic justice.” 

“Pretty good,” Feerman said, 
smiling faintly. 

“Oh, I’m not at all bad,” Flynn 
said, filling his pipe from a shaggy 
green pouch. “But the truth of the 
matter is, miracles cost money, al- 
ways have, always will. If the big 
boys couldn’t help you, I certainly 
couldn’t.” 

“Thanks for telling me,” Feer- 
man said, but made no move to get 
up. 

“It’s my duty as a therapist,” 
Flynn said slowly, “to remind you 
that The Academy is always open.” 

“How can I go there?” Feerman 
asked. “I don’t know anything 
about it.” 

“No one does,” Flynn said. “Still, 
I hear they cure every time.” 

THE ACADEMY 


“Death is a cure.” 

“But a non-functional one. Be- 
sides, that’s too discordant with the 
times. Deviants would have to run 
such a place, and deviants just 
aren’t allowed.” 

“Then why doesn’t anyone ever 
leave?” 

“Don’t ask me,” Flynn said. “Per- 
haps they don’t want to.” He puffed 
on his pipe. “You want some advice. 
OK. Have you any money?” 
“Some,” Feerman said warily. 
“OK. I shouldn’t be saying this, 
but . Stop looking for cures! Go 
home. Send your robutler out for a 
couple month’s supply of food. 
Hole up for a while.” 

“Hole up? Why?” 

Flynn scowled furiously at him. 
“Because you’re running yourself 
ragged trying to get back to the 
norm, and all you’re doing is get- 
ting worse. I’ve seen it happen a 
thousand times. Don’t think about 
sanity or unsanity. Just lie around 
a couple months, rest, read, grow 
fat. Then see how you are.” 

“Look,” Feerman said, “I think 
you’re right. I’m sure of it! But I’m 
not sure if I should go home. I 
made a telephone call today. 
I’ve got some money. Could you 
hide me here? Could you hide me?” 
Flynn stood up and looked fear- 
fully out the window at the dark 
street. “I’ve said too much as it is. 
If I were younger — but I can’t do 
it! I’ve given you unsane advice! I 
can’t commit an unsane action on 
top of that!” 

“I’m sorry,” Feerman said. “I 
shouldn’t have asked you. But I’m 
really grateful. I mean it.” He stood 
up. “How much do I owe you?” 
“Nothing,” Flynn said. “Good 


57 



luck to you . 55 

“Thanks . 55 Feerman hurried 
downstairs and hailed a cab. In 
twenty minutes he was home. 

T HE HALL was strangely quiet 
as Feerman walked toward his 
apartment. His landlady’s door was 
closed as he passed it, but he had 
the impression that it had been 
open until he came, and that the 
old woman was standing beside it 
now, her ear against the thin wood. 
He walked faster, and entered his 
apartment. 

It was quiet in his apartment, 
too. Feerman walked into the 
kitchen. His robutler was standing 
beside the stove, and Speed was 
curled up in the corner. 

“Welcome home, sir , 55 the robut- 
ler said. “If you will sit, I will serve 
your supper . 55 

Feerman sat down, thinking 
about his plans. There were a lot 
of details to work out, but Flynn 
was right. Hole up, that was the 
thing. Stay out of sight. 

“Til want you to go shopping 
first thing in the morning , 55 he said 
to the robutler. 

“Yes sir , 55 the robutler said, plac- 
ing a bowl of soup in front of him. 

“We’ll need plenty of staples. 
Bread, meat. No, buy canned 
goods.” 

“What kind of canned goods?” 
the robutler asked. 

“Any kind, as long as it’s a bal- 
anced diet. And cigarettes, don’t 
forget cigarettes! Give me the salt, 
will you?” 

The robutler stood beside the 
stove, not moving. But Speed began 
to whimper softly. 


“Robutler. The salt please.” 

“I’m sorry, sir,” the robutler said. 

“What do you mean, you’re 
sorry? Hand me the salt.” 

“I can no longer obey you.” 

“Why not?” ^ 

“You have just gone over the 
red line, sir. You are now plus ten.” 

Feerman just stared at him for a 
moment. Then he ran into the bed- 
room and turned on the Sanity 
Meter. The black indicator crept 
slowly to the red line, wavered, then 
slid decisively over. 

He was plus ten. 

But that didn’t matter, he told 
himself. After all, it was a quan- 
titative measurement. It didn’t 
mean that he had suddenly become 
a monster. He would reason with 
the robutler, explain it to him. 

Feerman rushed out of the bed- 
room. “Robutler! Listen to me — 55 

He heard the front door close. 
The robutler was gone. 

Feerman walked into the living 
room and sat down on the couch. 
Naturally the robutler was gone. 
They had built-in sanity reading 
equipment. If their masters passed 
the red line, they returned to the 
factory automatically. No plus ten 
could command a mechanical. 

But he still had a chance. There 
was food in the house. He would 
ration himself. It wouldn’t be too 
lonely with Speed here. Perhaps he 
would just need a few days. 

“Speed?” 

There was no sound in the apart- 
ment. 

“Come here, boy.” 

Still no sound. 

Feerman searched the apartment 
methodically, but the dog wasn’t 
there. He must have left with the 


58 


ROBERT SHECKLEY 



robutler. 

Alone, Feerman walked into the 
kitchen and drank three glasses of 
water. He looked at the meal his 
robutler had prepared, started to 
laugh, then checked himself. 

He had to get out, quickly. There 
was no time to lose. If he hurried, 
he could still make it, to someplace, 
any place. Every second counted 
now. 

But he stood in the kitchen, star- 
ing at the floor as the minutes 
passed, wondering why his dog had 
left him. 

There was a knock on his door. 

“Mr. Feerman!” 

“No,” Feerman said. 

“Mr. Feerman, you must leave 
now.” 

It was his landlady. Feerman 
walked to the door and opened it. 
“Go? Where?” 

“I don’t care. But you can’t stay 
here any longer, Mr. Feerman. You 
must go.” 

Feerman went back for his hat, 
put it on, looked around the apart- 
ment, then walked out. He left the 
door open. 

Outside, two men were waiting 
for him. Their faces were indistinct 
in the darkness. 

“Where do you want to go?” one 

OolcPfl 

“Where can I go?” 

“Surgery or The Academy.” 

“The Academy, then.” 

They put him in a car and drove 
quickly away. Feerman leaned 
back, too exhausted to think. He 
could feel a cool breeze on his face, 
and the slight vibration of the car 
was pleasant. But the ride seemed 
interminably long. 

“Here we are,” one of the men 

THE ACADEMY 


said at last. They stopped the car 
and led him inside an enormous 
gray building, to a barren little 
room. In the middle of the room 
was a desk marked RECEPTION- 
IST. A man was sprawled half 
across it, snoring gently. 

One of Feerman’s guards cleared 
his throat loudly. The receptionist 
sat up immediately, rubbing his 
eyes. He slipped on a pair of glasses 
and looked at them sleepily. 

“Which one?” he asked. 

The two guards pointed at Feer- 
man. 

“All right.” The receptionist 
stretched his thin arms, then 
opened a large black notebook. He 
made a notation, tore out the sheet 
and handed it to Feerman’s guards. 
They left immediately. 

The receptionist pushed a but- 
ton, then scratched his head vigor- 
ously. “Full moon tonight,” he said 
to Feerman, with evident satisfac- 
tion. 

“What?” Feerman asked. 

“Full moon. We get more of you 
guys when the moon’s full, or so it 
seems. I’ve thought of doing a 
study on it.” 

“More? More what?” Feerman 
asked, still adjusting to the shock 
of being within The Academy. 

“Don’t be dense,” the reception- 
ist said sternly. “We get more plus 
tens when the moon is full. I don’t 
suppose there’s any correlation, but 
— ah, here’s the guard.” 

A uniformed guard walked up to 
the desk, still knotting his tie. 

“Take him to 312AA,” the re- 
ceptionist said. As Feerman and the 
guard walked away, he removed 
his glasses and stretched out again 
on the desk. 


59 



HE GUARD led Feerman 
through a complex network of 
corridors, marked off with frequent 
doors. The corridors seemed to 
have grown spontaneously, for 
branches shot off at all angles, and 
some parts were twisted and curved, 
like ancient city streets. As he 
walked, Feerman noticed that the 
doors were not numbered in se- 
quence. He passed 3112, then 25P, 
and then 14. And he was certain 
that he passed the number 888 
three times. 

“How can you find your way?” 
he asked the guard. 

“That’s my job,” the guard said, 
not unpleasantly. 

“Not very systematic,” Feerman 
said, after a while. 

“Can’t be,” the guard said in an 
almost confidential tone of voice. 
“Originally they planned this place 
with a lot fewer rooms, but then the 
rush .started. Patients, patients, 
more every day, and no sign of a 
letup. So the rooms had to be bro- 
ken into smaller units, and new cor- 
ridors had to be cut through.” 

“But how do the doctors find 
their patients?” Feerman asked. 

They had reached 312AA. With- 
out answering, the guard unlocked 
the door, and, when Feerman had 
walked through, closed and locked 
it after him. 

It was a very small room. There 
was a couch, a chair, and a cabinet, 
filling all the available space. 

Almost immediately, Feerman 
heard voices outside the door. A 
man said, “Coffee then, at the cafe- 
teria in half an hour.” A key 
turned. Feerman didn’t hear the 
reply, but there was a sudden burst 
of laughter. A man’s deep voice 

60 


said, “Yes, and a hundred more and 
we’ll have to go underground for 
room!” 

The door opened and a bearded 
man in a white jacket came in, still 
smiling faintly. His face became 
professional as soon as he saw Feer- 
man. “Just lie on the couch, please,” 
he said, politely, but with an un- 
mistakable air of command. 

Feerman remained standing. 
“Now that I’m here,” he said, 
“would you explain what all this 
means?” 

The bearded man had begun to 
unlock the cabinet. He looked at 
Feerman with a wearily humorous 
expression, and raised both eye- 
brows. “I’m a doctor,” he said, “not 
a lecturer.” 

“I realize that. But surely — ” 

“Yes, yes,” the doctor said, shrug- 
ging his shoulders helplessly. “I 
know. You have a right to know, 
and all that. But they really should 
have explained it all before you 
reached here. It just isn’t my job.” 

Feerman remained standing. The 
doctor said, “Lie down on the 
couch like a good chap, and I’ll 
tell all.” He turned back to the 
cabinet. 

Feerman thought fleetingly of 
trying to overpower him, but real- 
ized that thousands of plus tens 
must have thought of it, too. Un- 
doubtedly there were precautions. 
He lay down on the couch. 

“The Academy,” the doctor said 
as he rummaged in the cabinet, is 
obviously a product of our times. 
To understand it, you must first 
understand the age we live in.” 
The doctor paused dramatically, 
then went on with evident gusto. 
“Sanity! But there is a tremendous 

ROBERT SHECKLEY 




strain involved in sanity, you know, 
and especially in social sanity. How 
easily the mind becomes deranged! 
And once deranged, values 
change, a man begins to have 
strange hopes, ideas, theories, and 
a need for action. These things may 
not be abnormal in themselves, but 
they result inevitably in harm to 
society, for movement in any direc- 
tion harms a static society. Now, 
after thousands of years of blood- 
shed, we have set ourselves the goal 
of protecting society against the 
unsane individual. Therefore — it is 
up to the individual to avoid those 
mental configurations, those im- 
plicit decisions which will make 
him a dangerous potential for 
change. This will to staticity which 
is our ideal required an almost 
superhuman strength and determi- 
nation. If you don’t have that, you 
end up here.” 

“I don’t see — ” Feerman began, 
but the doctor interrupted. 

“The need for The Academy 
should now be apparent. Today, 
brain surgery is the final effective 
alternative to sanity. But this is an 
unpleasant eventuality for a man 
to contemplate, a truly hellish alter- 
native. Government brain surgery 
involves death to the original per- 
sonality, which is death in its truest 
form. The Academy tries to relieve 
a certain strain by offering another 
alternative.” 

“But what is this alternative? 
Why don’t you tell it?” 

“Frankly, most people prefer not 
knowing.” The doctor closed and 
locked the cabinet, but Feerman 
could not see what instruments he 
had selected. “Your reaction isn’t 
typical, I assure you. You choose to 

THE ACADEMY 


think of us as something dark, mys- 
terious, frightening. This is because 
of your unsanity. Sane people see us 
as a panacea, a pleasantly misty re- 
lief from certain grim certainties. 
They accept us on faith.” The doc- 
tor chucked softly. 

“To most people, we represent 
heaven.” 

“Then why not let your methods 
be known?” 

“Frankly,” the doctor said softly, 
“even the methods of heaven are 
best not examined too closely.” 

“So the whole thing is a hoax!” 
Feerman said, trying to sit up. 
“You’re going to kill me!” 

“Most assuredly not,” the doctor 
said, restraining him gently until 
Feerman lay back again. 

“Then what exactly are you go- 
ing to do?” 

“You’ll see.” 

“And why doesn’t anyone re- 
turn?” 

“They don’t choose to,” the doc- 
tor said. Before Feerman could 
move, the doctor had deftly in- 
serted a needle into his arm, and 
injected him with a warm liquid. 
“You must remember,” the doctor 
said, “Society must be protected 
against the individual.” 

“Yes,” Feerman said drowsily, 
“but who is to protect the individ- 
ual against society?” 

The room became indistinct and, 
although the doctor answered him, 
Feerman couldn’t hear his words, 
but he was sure that they were wise, 
and proper, and very true. 

W HEN HE recovered con- 
sciousness he found that he 
was standing on a great plain. It 


61 



was sunrise. In the dim light, wisps 
of fog clung to his ankles, and the 
grass beneath his feet was wet and 
springy. 

Feerman was mildly surprised to 
see his wife standing beside him, 
close to his right side. On his left 
was his dog Speed, pressed against 
his leg, trembling slightly. His sur- 
prise passed quickly, because this 
was where his wife and dog should 
be; at his side before the battle. 

Ahead, misty movement resolved 
into individual figures, and as they 
approached Feerman recognized 
them. 

They were the enemy! Leading 
the procession was his robutler, 
gleaming inhumanly in the half- 
light. Morgan was there, shrieking 
to the Section Chief that Feerman 
must die, and Flynn, that fright- 
ened man, hid his face but still ad- 
vanced against him. And there was 
his landlady, screaming, “No home 
for him!” And behind her were 
doctors, receptionists, guards, and 
behind them marched millions of 
men in rough laborer’s clothing, 
caps jammed down over their faces, 
newspapers tightly rolled as they 
advanced. 

Feerman tensed expectantly for 
this ultimate fight against the ene- 


mies who had betrayed him. But a 
doubt passed over his mind. Was 
this real? 

He had a sudden sickening vision 
of his drugged body lying in a num- 
bered room in The Academy, 
while his soul was here in the never- 
never land, doing battle with 
shadows. 

There's nothing wrong with me! 
In a moment of utter clarity Feer- 
man understood that he had to es- 
cape. His destiny wasn’t here, fight- 
ing dream-enemies. He had to get 
back to the real world. The Status 
Quo couldn’t last forever. And 
what would mankind do, with all 
the toughness, inventiveness, indi- 
viduality bred out of the race? 

Did no one leave The Academy? 
He would! Feerman struggled with 
the illusions, and he could almost 
feel his discarded body stir on its 
couch, groan, move. 

But his dream-wife seized his 
arm and pointed. His dream-dog 
snarled at the advancing host. 

The moment was gone forever, 
but Feerman never knew it. He for- 
got his decision, forgot earth, forgot 
truth, and drops of dew spattered 
his legs as he ran forward to en- 
gage the enemy in battle.

By Philip K. Dick 

Illustrated by Paul Orban 

As curator of the Twentieth Century Exhibit, 
George Miller felt that to do a good job he had to 
live his work. Then, one day, somebody got into his 
exhibit and he went to investigate . 


T HAT’S a strange suit you have 
on / 5 the robot pubtrans driver 
observed. It slid back its door and 
came to rest at the curb. “What are 
the little round things?” 

“Those are buttons/ 5 ' George 
Miller explained. “They are partly 
functional, partly ornamental. This 
is an archaic suit of the twentieth 
century. I wear it because of the 
nature of my employment.” 

He paid the robot, grabbed up 
his briefcase, and hurried along the 
ramp to the History Agency. The 
main building was already open 
for the day; robed men and women 


wandered everywhere. Miller en- 
tered a PRIVATE lift, squeezed 
between two immense controllers 
from the pre-Christian division, 
and in a moment was on his way 
to his own level, the Middle Twen- 
tieth Century. 

“Gorning,” he murmured, as 
Controller Fleming met him at the 
atomic engine exhibit. 

“Gorning,” Fleming responded 
brusquely. “Look here, Miller. Let’s 
have this out once and for all. 
What if everybody dressed like 
you? The Government sets up strict 
rules for dress. Can’t you forget 


63 




your damn anachronisms once in 
awhile? What in God’s name is 
that thing in your hand? It looks 
like a squashed Jurassic lizard.” 

“This is an alligator-hide brief- 
case,” Miller explained. “I carry 
my study spools in it. The briefcase 
was an authority symbol of the 
managerial class of the latter twen- 
tieth century.” He unzipped the 
briefcase. “Try to understand, 
Fleming. By accustoming myself to 
everyday objects of my research 
period I transform my relation 
from mere intellectual curiosity to 
genuine empathy. You have fre- 
quently noticed I pronounce cer- 
tain words oddly. The accent is that 
of an American business man of the 
Eisenhower administration. Dig 
me?” 

“Eh?” Fleming muttered. 

“ Dig me was a twentieth century 
expression.” Miller laid out his 
study spools on his desk. “Was there 
anything you wanted? If not I’ll 
begin today’s work. I’ve uncovered 
fascinating evidence to indicate 
that although twentieth century 
Americans laid their own floor tiles, 
they did not weave their own cloth- 
ing. I wish to alter my exhibits on 
this matter.” 

“There’s no fanatic like an 
academician,” Fleming grated. 
“You’re two hundred years behind 
times. Immersed in your relics and 
artifacts. Your damn authentic rep- 
licas of discarded trivia.” 

“I love my work,” Miller an- 
swered mildly. 

“Nobody complains about your 
work. But there are other things 
than work. You’re a political-social 
unit here in this society. Take warn- 
ing, Miller! The Board has reports 

64 


on your eccentricities. They ap- 
prove devotion to work. His 
eyes narrowed significantly. “But 
you go too far.” 

“My first loyalty is to my art,” 
Miller said. 

“Your what? What does that 
mean?” 

“A twentieth century term.” 
There was undisguised superiority 
on Miller’s face. “You’re nothing 
but a minor bureaucrat in a vast 
machine. You’re a function of an 
impersonal cultural totality. You 
have no standards of your own. In 
the twentieth century men had per- 
sonal standards of workmanship. 
Artistic craft. Pride of accomplish- 
ment. These words mean nothing 
to you. You have no soul — another 
concept from the golden days of 
the twentieth century when men 
were free and could speak their 
minds.” 

“Beware, Miller!” Fleming 
blanched nervously and lowered 
his voice. “You damn scholars. 
Come up out of your tapes and face 
reality. You’ll get us all in trouble, 
talking this way. Idolize the past, 
if you want. But remember — it’s 
gone and buried. Times change. So- 
ciety progresses.” He gestured im- 
patiently at the exhibits that occu- 
pied the level. “That’s only an im- 
perfect replica.” 

“You impugn my research?” 
Miller was seething. “This exhibit 
is absolutely accurate! I correct it 
to all new data. There isn’t any- 
thing I don’t know about the twen- 
tieth century.” 

Fleming shook his head. “It’s no 
use.” He turned and stalked weari- 
ly off the level, onto the descent 
ramp. 


PHILIP K. DICK 



Miller straightened his collar 
and bright hand-painted necktie. 
He smoothed down his blue pin- 
stripe coat, expertly lit a pipeful of 
two-century-old tobacco, and re- 
turned to his spools. 

Why didn’t Fleming leave him 
alone? Fleming, the officious rep- 
resentative of the great hierarchy 
that spread like a sticky gray web 
over the whole planet. Into each in- 
dustrial, professional, and residen- 
tial unit. Ah, the freedom of the 
twentieth century! He slowed his 
tape scanner a moment, and a 
dreamy look slid over his features. 
The exciting age of virility and in- 
dividuality, when men were men. 

It was just about then, just as he 
was settling deep in the beauty of 
his research, that he heard the in- 
explicable sounds. They came from 
the center of his exhibit, from with- 
in the intricate, carefully-regulated 
interior. 

Somebody was in his exhibit. 

He could hear them back there, 
back in the depths. Somebody or 
something had got past the safety 
barrier set up to keep the public 
out. Miller snapped off his tape 
scanner and got slowly to his feet. 
He was shaking all over as he 
moved cautiously toward the ex- 
hibit. He killed the barrier and 
climbed the railing onto a concrete 
sidewalk. A few curious visitors 
blinked, as the small, oddly-dressed 
man crept among the authentic 
replicas of the twentieth century 
that made up the exhibit and dis- 
appeared within. 

Breathing hard, Miller advanced 
up the sidewalk and onto a care- 
fully-tended gravel path. Maybe it 

EXHIBIT PIECE 


was one of the other theorists, a 
minion of the Board, snooping 
around looking for something with 
which to discredit him. An inac- 
curacy here — a trifling error of no 
consequence there. Sweat came out 
on his forehead; anger became ter- 
ror. To his right was a flower bed. 
Paul Scarlet roses and low-growing 
pansies. Then the moist green lawn. 
The gleaming white garage, with 
its door half up. The sleek rear of 
a 1954 Buick — and then the house 
itself. 

He’d have to be careful. If it was 
somebody from the Board he’d be 
up against the official hierarchy. 
Maybe it was somebody big. May- 
be even Edwin Carnap, President 
of the Board, the highest ranking 
official in the N’York branch of 
the World Directorate. Shakily, 
Miller, climbed the three cement 
steps. Now he was on the porch of 
the twentieth century house that 
made up the center of the exhibit. 

It was a nice little house; if he 
had lived back in those days he 
would have wanted one of his own. 
Three bedrooms, a ranch-style 
California bungalow. He pushed 
open the front door and entered 
the livingroom. Fireplace at one 
end. Dark wine-colored carpets. 
Modem couch and easy chair. Low 
hardwood glass-topped coffee table. 
Copper ashtrays. A cigarette lighter 
and a stack of magazines. Sleek 
plastic and steel floor lamps. A 
bookcase. Television set. Picture 
window overlooking the front gar- 
den. He crossed the room to the 
hall. 

The house was amazingly com- 
plete. Below his- feet the floor fur- 
nace radiated a faint aura of 


65 



warmth. He peered into the first 
bedroom. A woman’s boudoir. Silk 
bed cover. White starched sheets. 
Heavy drapes. A vanity table. Bot- 
tles and jars. Huge round mirror. 
Clothes visible within the closet. A 
dressing gown thrown over the 
back of a chair. Slippers. Nylon 
hose carefully placed at the foot of 
the bed. 

Miller moved down the hall and 
peered into the next room. Bright- 
ly painted wallpaper: clowns and 
elephants and tight-rope walkers. 
The children’s room. Two little 
beds for the two boys. Model air- 
planes. A dresser with a radio on 
it, pair of combs, school books, pen- 
nants, a No Parking sign, snapshots 
stuck in the mirror. A postage 
stamp album. 

Nobody there, either. 

Miller peered in the modern 
bathroom, even into the yellow- 
tiled shower. He passed through 
the diningroom, glanced down the 
basement stairs where the washing 
machine and dryer were. Then he 
opened the back door and exam- 
ined the back yard. A lawn, and 
the incinerator. A couple of small 
trees and then the three-dimen- 
sional projected backdrop of other 
houses receding off into incredibly 
convincing blue hills. And still no 
one. The yard was empty — de- 
serted. He closed the door and 
started back. 

From the kitchen came laughter. 

A woman’s laugh. The clink of 
spoons and dishes. And smells. It 
took him a moment to identify 
them, scholar that he was. Bacon 
and coffee. And hot cakes. Some- 
body was eating breakfast. A twen- 
tieth century breakfast. 


He made his way down the hall, 
past a man’s bedroom, shoes and 
clothing strewn about, to the en- 
trance of the kitchen. 

A handsome late-thirtyish wom- 
an and two teen-age boys were sit- 
ting around the little chrome and 
plastic breakfast table. They had 
finished eating; the two boys were 
fidgeting impatiently. Sunlight fil- 
tered through the window over the 
sink. The electric clock read half 
past eight. The radio was chirping 
merrily in the corner. A big pot of 
black coffee rested in the center of 
the table, surrounded by empty 
plates and milk glasses and silver- 
ware. 

The woman had on a white 
blouse and checkered tweed skirt. 
Both boys wore faded blue jeans, 
sweatshirts, and tennis shoes. As 
yet they hadn’t noticed him. Miller 
stood frozen at the doorway, while 
laughter and small talk bubbled 
around him. 

“You’ll have to ask your father,” 
the woman was saying, with mock 
sternness. “Wait until he comes 
back.” 

“He already said we could,” one 
of the boys protested. 

“Well, ask him again.” 

“He’s always grouchy in the 
morning.” 

“Not today. He had a good 
night’s sleep. His hay fever didn’t 
bother him. That new anti-hist the 
doctor gave him.” She glanced up 
at the clock. “Go see what’s keep- 
ing him, Don. He’ll be late to 
work.” 

“He was looking for the news- 
paper.” One of the boys pushed 
back his chair and got up. “It 
missed the porch again and fell

in the flowers.” He turned toward 
the door, and Miller found him- 
self confronting him face to face. 
Briefly, the observation flashed 
through his mind that the boy 
looked familiar. Damn familiar — 
like somebody he knew, only young- 
er. He tensed himself for the im- 
pact, as the boy abruptly halted. 

“Gee,” the boy said. “You scared 
me. 

The woman glanced quickly up 
at Miller. “What are you doing 
out there, George?” she demanded. 
“Come on back in here and finish 
your coffee.” 

M ILLER came slowly into the 
kitchen. The woman was fin- 
ishing her coffee; both boys were 
on their feet and beginning to press 
around him. 

“Didn’t you tell me I could go 
camping over the weekend up at 
Russian River with the group from 
school?” Don demanded. “You said 
I could borrow a sleeping bag from 
the gym because the one I had you 
gave to the Salvation Army because 
you were allergic to the kapok in 
it.” 

“Yeah,” Miller muttered uncer- 
tainly. Don . That was the boy’s 
name. And his brother, Ted. But 
how did he know that? At the table 
the woman had got up and was 
collecting the dirty dishes to carry 
over to the sink. “They said you al- 
ready promised them,” she said 
over her shoulder. The dishes clat- 
tered into the sink and she began 
sprinkling soap flakes over them. 
“But you remember that time they 
wanted to drive the car and the 
way they said it, you’d think they 

68 


had got your okay. And they hadn’t, 
of course.” 

Miller sank weakly down at the 
table. Aimlessly, he fooled with his 
pipe. He set it down in the copper 
ashtray and examined the cuff of 
his coat. What was happening? His 
head spun. He got up abruptly and 
hurried to the window, over the 
sink. 

Houses, Streets. The distant hills 
beyond the town. The sights and 
sounds of people. The three-dimen- 
sional projected backdrop was ut- 
terly convincing; or was it the pro- 
jected backdrop? How could he be 
sure? What was happening? 

“George, what’s the matter?” 
Marjorie asked, as she tied a pink 
plastic apron around her waist and 
began running hot water in the 
sink. “You better get the car out 
and get started to work. Weren’t 
you saying last night old man 
Davidson was shouting about em- 
ployees being late for work and 
standing around the water cooler 
talking and having a good time on 
company time?” 

Davidson. The word stuck in 
Miller’s mind. He knew it, of 
course. A clear picture leaped up: 
a tall, white-haired old man, thin 
and stern. Vest and pocket watch. 
And the whole office, United Elec- 
tronic Supply. The twelve story 
building in downtown San Fran- 
cisco. The newspaper and cigar 
stand in the lobby. The honking 
cars. Jammed parking lots. The 
elevator, packed with bright-eyed 
secretaries, tight sweaters and per- 
fume. 

He wandered out of the kitchen, 
through the hall, past his own bed- 
room, his wife’s, and into the living- 

PHILIP K. DICK 



room. The front door was open and 
he stepped out onto the porch. 

The air was cool and sweet. It 
was a bright April morning. The 
lawns were still wet. Cars moved 
down Virginia Street, toward Shat- 
tuck Avenue. Early morning com- 
muting traffic, businessmen on their 
way to work. Across the street Earl 
Kelly cheerfully waved his Oak- 
land Tribune as he hurried down 
the sidewalk toward the bus stop. 

A long way off Miller could see 
the Bay Bridge, Yerba Buena Is- 
land, and Treasure Island. Beyond 
that was San Francisco itself. In a 
few minutes he’d be shooting across 
the bridge in his Buick, on his way 
to the office. Along with thousands 
of other businessmen in blue pin- 
stripe suits. 

Ted pushed past him and out on 
the porch. “Then it’s okay? You 
don’t care if we go camping?” 

Miller licked his dry lips. “Ted, 
listen to me. There’s something 
strange.” 

“Like what?” 

“I don’t know.” Miller wandered 
nervously around on the porch. 
“This is Friday, isn’t it?” 

“Sure.” 

“I thought it was.” But how did 
he know it was Friday? How did he 
know anything? But of course it 
was Friday. A long hard week — 
old man Davidson breathing down 
his neck. Wednesday, especially, 
when the General Electric order 
was slowed down because of a 
strike. 

“Let me ask you something,” Mil- 
ler said to his son. “This morning — 
I left the kitchen to get the news- 
paper.” 

Ted nodded. “Yeah. So?” 


“I got up and went out of the 
room. How long was 1 gone? Not 
long, was I?” He searched for 
words, but his mind was a maze of 
disjointed thoughts. “I was sitting 
at the breakfast table with you all, 
and then I got up and went to look 
for the paper. Right? And then I 
came back in. Right?” His voice 
rose desperately. “I got up and 
shaved and dressed this morning. I 
ate breakfast. Hot cakes and coffee. 
Bacon. Right?” 

“Right,” Ted agreed. “So?” 
“Like I always do.” 

“We only have hot cakes on 
Friday.” 

Miller nodded slowly. “That’s 
right. Hot cakes on Friday. Because 
your uncle Frank eats with us Sat- 
urday and Sunday and he can’t 
stand hot cakes, so we stopped hav- 
ing them on weekends. Frank is 
Marjorie’s brother. He was in the 
Marines in the First World War. 
He was a corporal.” 

“Goodbye,” Ted said, as Don 
came out to join him. “We’ll see 
you this evening.” 

School books clutched, the boys 
sauntered off toward the big 
modern high school in the center 
of Berkeley. 

Miller re-entered the house and 
automatically began searching the 
closet for his briefcase. Where was 
it? Damn it, he needed it. The 
whole Throckmorton account was 
in it ; Davidson would be yelling his 
head off if he left it anywhere, like 
in the True Blue Cafeteria that 
time they were all celebrating the 
Yankee’s winning the series. Where 
the hell was it — 

He straightened up slowly, as 
memory came. Of course. He had 

69 


EXHIBIT PIECE 



left it by his work desk, where he 
had tossed it after taking out the re- 
search tapes. While Fleming was 
talking to him. Back at the History 
Agency. 

He joined his wife in the kitchen. 
“Look,” he said huskily. “Marjorie, 
I think maybe I won’t go down to 
the office this morning.” 

Marjorie spun in alarm. “George, 
is anything wrong?” 

“I’m — completely confused.” 
“Your hay fever again?” 

“No. My mind. What’s the name 
of that psychiatrist the PTA recom- 
mended when Mrs. Bentley’s kid 
had that fit?” He searched his dis- 
organized brain. “Grunberg, I 
think. In the Medical-Dental build- 
ing.” He moved toward the door. 
“I’ll drop by and see him. Some- 
thing’s wrong — really wrong. And I 
don’t know what it is.” 

A DAM GRUNBERG was a large 
heavy-set man in his late forties, 
with curly brown hair and horn- 
rimmed glasses. After Miller had 
finished, Grunberg cleared his 
throat, brushed at the sleeve of his 
Brooks Bros, suit, and asked 
thoughtfully. 

“Did anything happen while you 
were out looking for the newspaper? 
Any sort of accident? You might 
try going over that part in detail. 
You got up from the breakfast 
table, went out on the porch, and 
started looking around in the 
bushes. And then what?” 

Miller rubbed his forehead 
vaguely. “I don’t know. It’s all con- 
fused. I don’t remember looking for 
any newspaper. I remember coming 
back in the house. Then it gets 


clear. But before that it’s all tied up 
with the History Agency and my 
quarrel with Fleming.” 

“What was that again about your 
briefcase? Go over that.” 

“Fleming said it looked like a 
squashed Jurassic lizard. And I 
said—” 

“No. I mean, about looking for 
it in the closet and not finding it.” 
“I looked in the closet and it 
wasn’t there, of course. It’s sitting 
beside my desk at the History 
Agency. On the Twentieth Century 
level. By my exhibits.” A strange ex- 
pression crossed Miller’s face. 
“Good God, Grunberg. You realize 
this may be nothing but an exhibit? 
You and everybody else — maybe 
you’re not real. Just pieces of this 
exhibit.” 

“That wouldn’t be very pleasant 
for us, would it?” Grunberg said, 
with a faint smile. 

“People in dreams are always 
secure until the dreamer wakes up,” 
Miller retorted. 

“So you’re dreaming me,” Grun- 
berg laughed tolerantly. “I suppose 
I should thank you.” 

“I’m not here because I especially 
like you. I’m here because I can’t 
stand Fleming and the whole His- 
tory Agency.” 

Grunberg pondered. “This Flem- 
ing. Are you aware of thinking 
about him before you went out look- 
ing for the newspaper?” 

Miller got to his feet and paced 
around the luxurious office, between 
the leather-covered chairs and the 
huge mahogany desk. “I want to 
face this thing. I’m in an exhibit. 
An artificial replica of the past. 
Fleming said something like this 
would happen to me.” 

PHILIP K. DICK

“Sit down, Mr. Miller,” Grun- 
berg said, in a gentle but command- 
ing voice. When Miller had taken 
his chair again, Grunberg con- 
tinued, “I understand what you say. 
You have a general feeling that 
everything around you is unreal. A 
sort of stage.” 

“An exhibit.” 

“Yes, an exhibit in a museum.” 
“In the N’York History Agency. 
Level R, the Twentieth Century 
level.” 

“And in addition to this general 
feeling of — insubstantiality, there 
are specific projected memories of 
persons and places beyond this 
world. Another realm in which this 
one is contained. Perhaps I should 
say, the reality within which this 
is only a sort of shadow world.” 
“This world doesn’t look shadowy 
to me.” Miller struck the leather 
arm of the chair savagely. “This 
world is completely real. That’s 
what’s wrong. I came in to investi- 
gate the noises and now I can’t get 
back out. Good God, do I have to 
wander around this replica the rest 
of my life?” 

“You know, of course, that your 
feeling is common to most of man- 
kind. Especially during periods of 
great tension. Where — by the way 
— was the newspaper? Did you find 
it?” 

“As far as I’m concerned — ” 

“Is that a source of irritation 
with you? I see you react strongly 
to a mention of the newspaper.” 
Miller shook his head wearily. 
“Forget it.” 

“Yes, a trifle. The paperboy care- 
lessly throws the newspaper in the 
bushes, not on the porch. It makes 
you angry. It happens again and 

EXHIBIT PIECE 


again. Early in the day, just as 
you’re starting to work. It seems to 
symbolize in a small way the whole 
petty frustrations and defeats of 
your job. Your whole life.” 

“Personally, I don’t give a damn 
about the newspaper.” Miller ex- 
amined his wristwatch. “I’m going 
— it’s almost noon. Old man David- 
son will be yelling his head off if 
I’m not at the office by — ” He broke 
off. “There it is again.” 

“There what is?” 

“All this!” Miller gestured im- 
patiently out the window. “This 
whole place. This damn world. This 
exhibition ” 

“I have a thought,” Doctor 
Grunberg said slowly. “I’ll put it to 
you for what it’s worth. Feel free to 
reject it if it doesn’t fit.” He raised 
his shrewd, professional eyes. “Ever 
see kids playing with rocketships?” 
“Lord,” Miller said wretchedly. 
“I’ve seen commercial rocket 
freighters hauling cargo between 
Earth and Jupiter, landing at La- 
Guardia Spaceport.” 

Grunberg smiled slightly. “Fol- 
low me through on this. A question. 
Is it job tension?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“It would be nice,” Grunberg 
said blandly, “to live in the world 
of tomorrow. With robots and 
rocket ships to do all the work. You 
could just sit back and take it easy. 
No worries, no cares. No frustra- 
tions.” 

“My position in the History 
Agency has plenty of cares and frus- 
trations.” Miller rose abruptly. 
“Look, Grunberg. Either this is an 
exhibit on R level of the History 
Agency, or I’m a middle-class busi- 
nessman with an escape fantasy. 

71 



Right now I can’t decide which. 
One minute I think this is real, and 
the next minute — ” 

“We can decide easily,” Grun- 
berg said. 

“How?” 

“You were looking for the news- 
paper. Down the path, onto the 
lawn. Where did it happen ? Was 
it on the path? On the porch? Try 
to remember.” 

“I don’t have to try. I was still 
on the sidewalk. I had just jumped 
over the rail past the safety screens.” 
“On the sidewalk. Then go back 
there. Find the exact place.” 
“Why?” 

“So you can prove to yourself 
there’s nothing on the other side.” 
Miller took a deep, slow breath. 
“Suppose there is?” 

“There can’t be. You said your- 
self: only one of the worlds can be 
real. This world is real — ” Grun- 
berg thumped his massive ma- 
hogany desk. “Ergo, you won’t find 
anything on the other side.” 

“Yes,” Miller said, after a mo- 
ment’s silence. A peculiar expres- 
sion cut across his face and stayed 
there. “You’ve found the mistake.” 
“What mistake?” Grunberg was 
puzzled. “What — ” 

Miller moved toward the door of 
the office. “I’m beginning to get it. 
I’ve been putting up a false ques- 
tion. Trying to decide which world 
is real.” He grinned humorlessly 
back at Doctor Grunberg. “They’re 
both real, of course.” 

H E GRABBED a taxi and headed 
back to the house. No one was 
home. The boys were in school and 
Marjorie had gone downtown to 

72 


shop. He waited indoors until he 
was sure nobody was watching 
along the street, and then started 
down the path to the sidewalk. 

He found the spot without any 
trouble. There was a faint shimmer 
in the air, a weak place just at the 
edge of the parking strip. Through 
it he could see faint shapes. 

He was right. There is was — 
complete and real. As real as the 
sidewalk under him. 

A long metallic bar was cut off 
by the edges of the circle. He recog- 
nized it: the safety railing he had 
leaped over to enter the exhibit. Be- 
yond it was the safety screen system. 
Turned off, of course. And beyond 
that, the rest of the level and the 
far walls of the History building. 

He took a cautious step into the 
weak haze. It shimmered around 
him, misty and oblique. The shapes 
beyond became clearer. A moving 
figure in a dark blue robe. Some 
curious person examining the ex- 
hibits. The figure moved on and 
was lost. He could see his own work 
desk, now. His tape scanner and 
heaps of study spools. Beside the 
desk was his briefcase, exactly where 
he had expected it. 

While he was considering step- 
ping over the railing to get the 
briefcase, Fleming appeared. 

Some inner instinct made Miller 
step back through the weak spot, as 
Fleming approached. Maybe it was 
the expression on Fleming’s face. In 
any case, Miller was back and 
standing firmly on the concrete side- 
walk, when Fleming halted just be- 
yond the juncture, face red, lips 
twisting with indignation. 

“Miiler,” he said thickly. “Gome 
out of there.” 


PHILIP K. DICK 



Miller laughed. “Be a good fel- 
low, Fleming. Toss me my brief- 
case. It’s that strange looking thing 
over by the desk. I showed it to you 
— remember?” 

“Stop playing games and listen 
to me!” Fleming snapped. “This is 
serious. Carnap knows. I had to in- 
form him.” 

“Good for you. The loyal bureau- 
crat.” 

Miller bent over to light his pipe. 
He inhaled and puffed a great cloud 
of gray tobacco smoke through the 
weak spot, out into the R level. 
Fleming coughed and retreated. 

“What’s that stuff?” he de- 
manded. 

“Tobacco. One of the things they 
have around here. Very common 
substance in the twentieth century. 
You wouldn’t know about that — 
your period is the second century, 
BG. The Hellenistic world. I don’t 
know how well you’d like that. They 
didn’t have very good plumbing 
back there. Life expectancy was 
damn short.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

“In comparison, the life ex- 
pectancy of my research period is 
quite high. And you should see the 
bathroom I’ve got. Yellow tile. And 
a shower. We don’t have anything 
like that at the Agency leisure- 
quarters.” 

Fleming grunted sourly. “In 
other words, you’re going to stay 
in there.” 

“It’s a pleasant place,” Miller 
said easily. “Of course, my position 
is better than average. Let me 
describe it for you. I have an at- 
tractive wife: marriage is per- 

mitted, even sanctioned in this era. 
I have two fine kids — both boys — 


who are going up to Russian River 
this weekend. They live with me 
and my wife — we have complete 
custody of them. The State has no 
power of that, yet. I have a brand 
new Buick — ” 

“Illusions,” Fleming spat. “Psy- 
chotic delusions.” 

“Are you sure?” 

“You damn fool! I always knew 
you were too ego-recessive to face 
reality. You and your anachronistic 
retreats. Sometimes I’m ashamed 
I’m a theoretician. I wish I had 
gone into engineering.” Fleming’s 
lip twitched. “You’re insane, you 
know. You’re standing in the mid- 
dle of an artificial exhibit, which is 
owned by the History Agency, a 
bundle of plastic and wire and 
struts. A replica of a past age. An 
imitation. And you’d rather be 
there than in the real world.” 

“Strange,” Miller said thought- 
fully. “Seems to me I’ve heard the 
same thing very recently. You don’t 
know a Doctor Grunberg, do you? 
A psychiatrist.” 

Without formality, Director Car- 
nap arrived with his company of 
assistants and experts. Fleming 
quickly retreated. Miller found him- 
self facing one of the most powerful 
figures of the twenty-second cen- 
tury. He grinned and held out his 
hand. 

“You insane imbecile,” Carnap 
rumbled. “Get out of there before 
we drag you out. If we have to do 
that, you’re through. You know 
what they do with advanced psy- 
chotics. It’ll be euthanasia for you. 
I’ll give you one last chance to come 
out of that fake exhibit — ” 

“Sorry,” Miller said. “It’s not 
an exhibit.” 


EXHIBIT PIECE 


73 



Carnap’s heavy face registered 
sudden surprise. For a brief instant 
his massive poise vanished. “You 
still try to maintain — ” 

“This is a time gate/’ Miller said 
quietly. “You can’t get me out, Car- 
nap. You can’t reach me. I’m in the 
past, two hundred years back. I’ve 
crossed back to a previous existence- 
coordinate. I found a bridge and 
escaped from your continuum to 
this. And there’s nothing you can 
do about it.” 

C ARNAP and his experts huddled 
together in a quick technical con- 
ference. Miller waited patiently. He 
had plenty of time ; he had decided 
not to show up at the office until 
Monday. 

After awhile Carnap approached 
the juncture again, being careful 
not to step over the safety railing. 
“An interesting theory, Miller. 
That’s the strange part about psy- 
chotics. They rationalize their de- 
lusions into a logical system. A 
priori, your concept stands up well. 
It’s internally consistent. Only — ” 
“Only what?” 

“Only it doesn’t happen to be 
true.” Carnap had regained his con- 
fidence; he seemed to be enjoying 
the interchange. “You think you’re 
really back in the past. Yes, this ex- 
hibit is extremely accurate. Your 
work has always been good. The 
authenticity of detail is unequalled 
by any of the other exhibits.” 

“I tried to do my work well,” 
Miller murmured. 

“You wore archaic clothing and 
affected archaic speech-manner- 
isms. You did everything possible 
to throw yourself back. You devoted 

74 


yourself to your work.” Carnap 
tapped the safety railing with his 
fingernail. “It would be a shame, 
Miller. A terrible shame to demolish 
such an authentic replica.” 

There was silence. 

“I see your point,” Miller said, 
after a time. “I agree with you, cer- 
tainly. I’ve been very proud of my 
work — I’d hate to see it all torn 
down. But that really won’t do you 
any good. All you’ll succeed in do- 
ing is closing the time gate.” 
“You’re sure?” 

“Of course. The exhibit is only 
a bridge, a link with the past. I 
passed through the exhibit, but I’m 
not there now. I’m beyond the ex- 
hibit.” He grinned tightly. “Your 
demolition can’t reach me. But seal 
me off, if you want. I don’t think 
I’ll be wanting to come back.” 

“I wish you could see this side, 
Carnap. It’s a nice place here. Free- 
dom, opportunity. Limited govern- 
ment, responsible to the people. If 
you don’t like a job here you can 
quit. There’s no euthanasia, here. 
Come on over. I’ll introduce you to 
my wife.” 

“We’ll get you,” Carnap said. 
“And all your psychotic figments 
along with you.” 

“I doubt if any of my ‘psychotic 
figments’ are worried. Grunberg 
wasn’t. I don’t think Marjorie is — ” 
“We’ve already begun demolition 
preparations,” Carnap said calmly. 
“We’ll do it piece by piece, not all 
at once. So you may have the op- 
portunity to appreciate the scien- 
tific and — artistic way we take your 
imaginary world and people apart.” 
“You’re wasting your time,” Mil- 
ler said. He turned and walked off, 
down the sidewalk, to the gravel 

PHILIP K. DICK 



path and up onto the front porch 
of his house. 

In the living room he threw him- 
self down in the easy chair and 
snapped on the television set. Then 
he went to the kitchen and got a 
can of ice cold beer from the re- 
frigerator. He carried it happily 
back into the safe, comfortable 
living room. 

As he was seating himself in front 
of the television set he noticed 
something rolled up on the low 
coffee table. 

He grinned wryly. It was the 


morning newspaper, which he had 
looked so hard for. Marjorie had 
brought it in with the milk, as usual. 
And of course forgotten to tell him. 
He yawned contentedly and 
reached over to pick it up. Languid- 
ly, confidently, he unfolded it — and 
read the big black headlines.

O N SATURDAY, which was 
August 6th that year, a ball 
of eerie light descended on the des- 
ert and people twenty miles away 
stared at the phosphorescent trail 
it left on the twilight sky. 

“A meteor,” they said but that 
was because they had to say some- 
thing. 

In darkness hovering. A sound- 
less shell of metals glistening pale — 
held aloft by threads of anti-gravity . 
Below , the planet, shrouded with 
night, turning from the moon. On 
its black-swept face, an animal star- 
ing up with bright-eyed panic at the 
dully phosphorescent globe sus- 


pended overhead. A twitch of mus- 
cle. The hard earth drums delicately 
beneath fleeing pawbeats. Silence 
again, wind-soughed and lone. 
Hours. Black hours passing into 
grey, then mottled pink. Sunlight 
sprays across the metal globe. It 
shimmers with unearthly light. 

It was like putting his hand into 
a scorching oven. 

“Oh my God, it’s hot,” he said, 
grimacing, jerking back his hand 
and closing it once more, gingerly, 
over the sweat-stained steering 
wheel. 

“It’s your imagination.” Marian 
lay slumped against the warm, plas- 


77 



tic-covered seat. A mile behind, 
she’d stuck her sandaled feet out 
the window. Her eyes were closed, 
breath fell in fitful gasps from her 
drying lips. Across her face, the hot 
wind fanned bluntly, ruffling the 
short blond hair. 

“It’s not hot,” she said, squirm- 
ing uncomfortably, tugging at the 
narrow belt on her shorts. “It’s cool. 
As a cucumber.” 

“Ha,” Les grunted. He leaned 
forward a little and clenched his 
teeth at the feel of his sport shirt 
clinging damply to his back. “What 
a month for driving,” he growled. 

They’d left Los Angeles three 
days before on their way to visit 
Marian’s family in New York. The 
weather had been equatorial from 
the start, three days of blazing sun 
that had drained them of energy. 

The schedule they were attempt- 
ing to maintain made things even 
worse. On paper, four hundred 
miles a day didn’t seem like much. 
Converted into practical traveling 
it was brutalizing. Traveling over 
dirt cutoffs that sent up spinning, 
choking dust clouds. Traveling over 
rut-pocked stretches of highway un- 
der repair; afraid to hit more than 
twenty miles an hour on them for 
fear of snapping an axle or shaking 
their brains loose. 

Worst of all, traveling up twenty 
to thirty mile grades that sent the 
radiator into boiling frenzies every 
half hour or so. Then sitting for 
long, sweltering minutes, waiting 
for the motor to cool off, pouring in 
fresh water from the water bag, 
sitting and waiting in the middle of 
an oven. 

“I’m done on one side,” Les said, 
breathlessly. “Turn me.” 

78 


“And ha to you,” Marian sotto 
voiced. 

“Any water left?” 

Marian reached down her left 
hand and tugged off the heavy top 
of the portable ice box. Feeling in- 
side its coolish interior, she pulled 
up the thermos bottle. She shook it. 

“Empty,” she said, shaking her 
head. 

“As my head ” he finished in a 
disgusted voice, “For ever letting 
you talk me into driving to New 
York in August.” 

“Now, now,” she said, her cajol- 
ing a trifle worn, “Don’t get heated 
up. 

“Damn!” he snapped irritably, 
“When is this damn cutoff going 
to get back to the damn highway?” 

“Damn,” she muttered lightly, 
“Damn damn.” 

He said no more. His hands 
gripped tighter on the wheel. Hwy. 
66 , alt . rte. — they’d been on the 
damn thing for hours now, shunted 
aside by a section of the main high- 
way undergoing repair. For that 
matter, he wasn’t even sure they 
were on the alternate route. There 
had been five crossroads in the past 
two hours. In speeding along to get 
out of the desert, he hadn’t looked 
too carefully at the crossroad signs. 

“Honey, there’s a station,” 
Marian said, “let’s see if we can 
get some water.” 

“And some gas,” he added, glanc- 
ing at the gauge, “And some in- 
structions on how to get back to the 
highway.” 

“The damn highway,” she said. 

A faint smile tugged at Les’s 
mouth corners as he pulled the Ford 
off the road and braked up beside 
the two paint-chipped pumps that 

RICHARD MATHESON 



stood before an old sagging shack. 

“This is a hot looking spot,” he 
said dispassionately. “Ripe for de- 
velopment.” 

* “For the right party.” Marian’s 
eyes closed again. She drew in a 
heavy breath through her open 
mouth. 

No one came out of the shack. 

“Oh, don’t tell me it’s deserted” 
Les said disgustedly, looking 
around. 

Marian drew down her long legs. 
“Isn’t there anybody here?” she 
asked, opening her eyes. 

“Doesn’t look like it.” 

Les pushed open the door and 
slid out. As he stood, an involun- 
tary grunt twitched his body and 
his knees almost buckled. It felt as 
if someone had dropped a mountain 
of heat on his head. 

c tGod!” He blinked away the 
waves of blackness lapping at his 
ankles. 

“What is it?” 

“This heat ” He stepped between 
the two rusty handled pumps and 
crunched over the hot, flaky ground 
for the doorway of the shack. 

“And we’re not even a third of 
the way,” he muttered grimly to 
himself. Behind him, he heard the 
car door slam on Marian’s side and 
her loose sandals flopping on the 
ground. 

Dimness gave the illusion of cool- 
ness only for a second. Then the 
muggy, sodden air in the shack 
pressed down on Les and he hissed 
in displeasure. 

There was no one in the shack. 
He looked around its small confines 
at the uneven-legged table with the 
scarred surface, the backless chair, 
the cobwebbed coke machine, the 


price lists and calendars on the 
wall, the threadbare shade on the 
small window, drawn down to the 
sill, shafts of burnished light impal- 
ing the many rents. 

The wooden floor creaked as he 
stepped back out into the heavy 
sunlight. 

“No one?” Marian asked and he 
shook his head. They looked at each 
other without expression a moment 
and she patted at her forehead with 
a damp handkerchief. 

“Well, onward,” she said wryly. 

That was when they heard the 
car come rattling down the rutted 
lane that led off the road into the 
desert. They walked to the edge of 
the shack and watched the old, 
home-made tow truck make its 
wobbling, noisy approach toward 
the station. Far back from the road 
was the low form of the house it had 
come from. 

“To the rescue,” Marian said. “I 
hope he has water.” 

As the truck groaned to a halt 
beside the shack, they could see the 
heavily-tanned face of the man be- 
hind the wheel. He was somewhere 
in his thirties, a dour looking in- 
dividual in a tee shirt and patched 
and faded blue overalls. Lank hair 
protruded from beneath the brim 
of his grease-stained stetson. 

It wasn’t a smile he gave them 
as he slid out of the truck. It was 
more like a reflex twitching of his 
lean, humorless mouth. He moved 
up to them with jerky boot strides, 
his dark eyes moving from one to 
the other of them. 

“You want gas?” he asked Les in 
a hard, thick-throated voice. 

“Please.” 

The man looked at Les a moment 

79 


BEING 



as if he didn’t understand. Then 
he grunted and headed for the 
Ford, reaching into his back overall 
pocket for the pump key. As he 
walked past the front bumper, he 
glanced down at the license plate. 

He stood looking dumbly at the 
tank cap for a moment, his cal- 
loused fingers trying vainly to un- 
screw it. 

“It locks,” Les told him, walking 
over hurriedly with the keys. The 
man took them without a word and 
unlocked the cap. He put the cap 
on top of the trunk door. 

“You want ethyl?” he asked, 
glancing up, his eyes shadowed by 
the wide hat brim. 

“Please,” Les told him. 

“How much?” 

“You can fill it.” 

The hood was burning hot. Les 
jerked back his fingers with a gasp. 
He took out his handkerchief, 
wrapped it around his hand and 
pulled up the hood. When he un- 
screwed the radiator cap, boiling 
water frothed out and splashed 
down smoking onto the parched 
ground. 

“Oh, fine,” he muttered to him- 
self. 

The water from the hose was al- 
most as hot. Marian came over and 
put one finger in the slow gush as 
Les held it over the radiator. 

“Oh . gee,” she said in disap- 
pointment. She looked over at the 
overalled man. “Have you got any 
cool water?” she asked. 

The man kept his head down, his 
mouth pressed into a thin, drooping 
line. She asked again, without re- 
sult. 

“The hair-triggered Arizonian,” 
she muttered to Les as she started 

80 


back toward the man. 

“I beg your pardon,” she said. 

The man jerked up his head, 
startled, the pupils of his dark eyes 
flaring. “Ma’m?” he said quickly. 

“Can we get some cool drinking 
water?” 

The man’s rough-skinned throat 
moved once. “Not here, ma’m,” he 
said, “but . 

His voice broke off and he looked 
at her blankly. 

“You . you’re from California, 
ain’t you?” he said. 

“That’s right.” 

“Goin’ . ‘ far?” 

“New York,” she said impatient- 
ly. “But what about — ” 

The man’s bleached eyebrows 
moved together. “New York,” he 
repeated. “Pretty far.” 

“What about the water?” Marian 
asked him. 

“Well,” the man said, his lips 
twitching into the outline of a 
smile, “I ain’t got none here but if 
you want to drive back to the house, 
my wife’ll get you some.” 

“Oh.” Marian shrugged slightly. 
“All. right.” 

“You can look at my zoo while 
my wife gets the water,” the man 
offered, then crouched down quick- 
ly beside the fender to listen and 
hear if the tank were filling up. 

“We have to no back to his house 

c ) 

to get water,” Marian told Les as 
he unscrewed one of the battery 
caps. 

“Oh? Okay.” 

The man turned off the pump 
and replaced the cap. 

“New York, haah?” he said, look- 
ing at them. Marian smiled politely 
and nodded. 

After Les had pushed the hood 

RICHARD MATHESON 



back down, they got into the car 
to follow the man’s truck back to 
the house. 

“He has a zoo,” Marian said, ex- 
pressionlessly. 

“How nice,” Les said as he let up 
the clutch and the car rolled down 
off the slight rise on which the gas 
pumps stood. 

“They make me mad,” Marian 
said. 

They’d seen dozens of the zoos 
since they’d left Los Angeles. They 
were usually located beside gas sta- 
tions — designed to lure extra cus- 
tomers. Invariably, they were piti- 
ful collections — barren little cages 
in which gaunt foxes cringed, star- 
ing out with sick, glazed eyes, rattle- 
snakes coiled lethargically, maybe a 
feather-molted eagle glowered from 
a dark cage corner. And, usually, in 
tjie middle of the so-called zoo 
would be a chained-up wolf or 
coyote ; a straggly woe-be-gone crea- 
ture who paced constantly in a cir- 
cle whose radius was the length of 
the chain; who never looked at the 
people but stared straight ahead 
with red-rimmed eyes, pacing end- 
lessly on thin stalks of legs. 

“I hate them,” Marian said bit- 
terly. 

“I know, baby,” Les said. 

“If we didn’t need water, I’d 
never go back to his damned old 
house.” 

Les smiled. “Okay ma,” he said 
quietly, trying to avoid the holes in 
the lane. “Oh . 33 He snapped two 
fingers. “I forgot to ask him how to 
get back to the highway.” 

“Ask him when we get to his 
house,” she said. 

The house was faded brown, a 
two-story wooden structure that 

BEING 


looked a hundred years old. Behind 
it stood a row of low, squarish huts. 

“The zoo,” Les said, “Lions ’n 
tigers ’n everything.” 

“Nuts,” she said. 

He pulled up in front of the quiet 
house and saw the man in the stet- 
son slide off the dusty seat of his 
truck and jump down off the run- 
ning board. 

“Get you the water,” he said 
quickly and started for the house. 
He stopped a moment and looked 
back. “Zoo’s in the back,” he said, 
gesturing with his head. 

They watched him move up the 
steps of the old house. Then Les 
stretched and blinked at the glaring 
sunlight. 

“Shall we look at the zoo ? 33 he 
asked, trying not to smile. 

“No.” 

“Oh, come on.” 

“No, I don’t want to see that 33 

“I’m going to take a look.” 

“Well ... all right,” she said, 
“but it’s going to make me mad.” 

They walked around the edge of 
the house and moved along its side 
in the shade. 

“Oh, does that feel good,” 
Marian said. 

“Hey, he forgot to ask for his 
money.” 

“He will,” she said. 

They approached the first cage 
and looked into the dim interior 
through the two-foot-square win- 
dow that was barred with thick 
doweling. 

“Empty,” Les said. 

“Good.” 

“Some zoo.” 

They walked slowly toward the 
next cage. “Look how small they 
are,” Marian said unhappily, “How 

81 



would he like to be cooped up in 
one of them?” 

She stopped walking. 

“No, I’m not going to look,” she 
said angrily, “I don’t want to see 
how the poor things are suffering.” 

“I’ll just take a look,” he said. 

“You’re a fiend.” 

She heard him chuckle as she 
stood watching him walk up to the 
second of the cages. He looked in. 

“Marian!” His cry made her 
body twitch. 

“What is it?” she asked, running 
to him anxiously. 

“Look” 

He stared with shocked eyes into 
the cage. 

Her whisper trembled. “Oh my 
God” 

There was a man in the cage. 

HE LOOKED at him with un- 
believing eyes, unconscious of 
the large drops of sweat trickling 
across her brow and down her 
temples. 

The man was lying on the floor, 
sprawled like a broken doll across 
a dirty army blanket. His eyes were 
open but the man saw nothing. His 
pupils were dilated, he looked 
doped. His grimy hands rested limp- 
ly on the thinly-strawed floor, mo- 
tionless twists of flesh and bone. His 
mouth hung open like a yellow- 
toothed wound, edged with dry, 
cracking lips. 

When Les turned, he saw that 
Marian was already looking at him, 
her face blank, the skin drawn taut- 
ly over her paling cheeks. 

“What is this?” she asked in a 
faint tremor of voice. 

“I don’t know.” 

82 


He glanced once more into the 
cage as if he already doubted what 
he’d seen. Then he was looking at 
Marian again. “I don’t know,” he 
repeated, feeling the heartbeats 
throb heavily in his chest. 

Another moment they looked at 
each other, their eyes stark with 
uncomprehending shock. 

“What are we going to do?” 
Marian asked, almost whispering 
the words. 

Les swallowed the hard lump in 
his throat. He looked into the cage 
again. “Hello” he heard himself 
say, “Can you — ” 

He broke off abruptly, throat 
moving again. The man was coma- 
tose. 

“Les, what if — ” 

He looked at her. And, suddenly, 
his scalp was crawling because 
Marian was looking in wordless ap- 
prehension at the next cage. 

His running footsteps thudded 
over the dry earth, raising the dust. 

“No” he murmured, looking into 
the next cage. He felt himself shud- 
der uncontrollably as Marian ran 
up to him. 

“Oh my God, this is hideous ” 
she cried, staring with sick fright 
at the second caged man. 

They both started as the man 
looked up at them with glazed, life- 
less eyes. For a moment, his slack 
body lurched up a few inches and 
his dry lips fluttered as though he 
were trying to speak. A thread of 
saliva ran from one corner of his 
mouth and dribbled down across 
his beard-blackened chin. For a 
moment his sweaty, dirt-lined face 
was a mask of impotent entreaty. 

Then his head rolled to one side 
and his eyes rolled back. 

RICHARD MATHESON 




Marian backed away from the 
cage, shaking hand pressed to her 
cheek. 

“The man’s insane ” she mut- 
tered and looked around abruptly 
at the silent house. 

Then Les had turned too and 
both of them were suddenly aware 
of the man in the house who had 
told them to go and look at his zoo. 

“Les, what are we going to do?” 
Marian’s voice shook with rising 
hysteria. 

Les felt numb, devoured by the 
impact of what they’d seen. For a 
long moment he could only stand 
shivering and stare at his wife, feel- 
ing immersed in some fantastic 
dream. 

Then his lips jammed together 
and the heat seemed to flood over 
him. 

, “Let’s get out of here,” he 
snapped and grabbed her hand. 

The only sound was their harsh 
panting and the quick slap of 
Marian’s sandals on the hard 
ground. The air throbbed with in- 
tense heat, smothering their breath, 
making perspiration break out 
heavily across their faces and 
bodies. 

“Faster,” Les gasped, tugging at 
her hand. 

Then, as they turned the edge of 
the house, they both recoiled with 
a violent contracting of muscles. 

“No!” Marian’s cry contorted 
her face into a twisted mask of ter- 
ror. 

The man stood between them 
and their car, a long double-bar- 
reled shotgun leveled at them. 

Les didn’t know why the idea 
flooded through his brain. But, sud- 
denly, he realized that no one knew 


where he and Marian were, no one 
could even know where to begin 
searching for them. In rising panic, 
he thought of the man asking them 
where they were going, he thought 
of the man looking down at their 
California license plate. 

And he heard the man, the hard, 
emotionless voice of the man. 

“Now go on back,” the man said, 
“to the zoo” 

A FTER he’d locked the couple 
in one of the cages, Merv 
Ketter walked slowly back to the 
house, the heavy shotgun pulling 
down his right arm. He’d felt no 
pleasure in the act, only a draining 
relief that had, for a moment, loos- 
ened the tightness in his body. But, 
already, the tightness was returning. 
It never went away for more than 
the few minutes it took him to trap 
another person and cage him. 

If anything, the tightness was 
worse now. This was the first time 
he’d ever put a woman in one of 
his cages. The knowledge twisted 
a cold knot of despair in his chest. 
A woman — he’d put a woman in 
his cage. His chest shuddered with 
harsh breath as he ascended the 
rickety steps of the back porch. 

Then, as the screen door slapped 
shut behind him, his long mouth 
tightened. Well, what was he sup- 
posed to do? He slammed the shot- 
gun down on the yellow oil-clothed 
surface of the kitchen table, an- 
other forced breath wracking his 
chest. What else could I do — he 
argued with himself. His boots 
clacked sharply across the worn 
linoleum as he walked to the quiet, 
sun-lanced livingroom. 


BEING 83 



Dust rose from the old arm chair 
as he dropped down heavily, spirit- 
lessly. What was he supposed to do? 
He’d had no choice. 

For the thousandth time, he 
looked down at his left forearm, at 
the slight reddish bulge just under 
the elbow joint. Inside his flesh, the 
tiny metal cone was still humming 
delicately. He knew it without lis- 
tening. It never stopped. 

He slumped back exhaustedly 
with a groan and lay his head on 
the high back of the chair. His eyes 
stared dully across the room, 
through the long slanting bar of 
sunlight quivering with dust motes. 
At the mantelpiece. 

The Mauser rifle — he stared at 
it. The Luger, the bazooka shell, 
the hand grenade, all of them still 
active. Vaguely, through his tor- 
mented brain, curled the idea of 
putting the Luger to his temple, 
holding the Mauser against his side, 
even of pulling out the pin and 
holding the grenade against his 
stomach. 

War hero . The phrase scraped 
cruelly at his mind. It had long lost 
its meaning, its comfort. Once, it 
had meant something to him to be 
a medaled warrior, ribboned, 
lauded, admired. 

Then Elsie had died, then the 
battles and the pride were gone. He 
was alone in the desert with his 
trophies and with nothing else. 

And then one day he’d gone into 
that desert to hunt. 

His eyes shut, his leathery throat 
moved convulsively. What was the 
use of thinking, of regretting? The 
will to live was still in him. Maybe 
it was a stupid, a pointless will but 
it was there just the same; he 

84 


couldn’t rid himself of it. Not after 
two men were gone, not after five, 
no, not even after seven men were 
gone. 

The dirt-filled nails dug remorse- 
lessly into his palms until they broke 
the skin. But a woman, a woman. 
The thought knifed at him. He’d 
never planned on caging a woman. 

One tight fist drove down in 
futile rage on his leg. He couldn’t 
help it. Sure, he’d seen the Califor- 
nia plate. But he wasn’t going to do 
it. Then the woman had asked for 
water and he suddenly had known 
that he had no choice, he had to do 
it. 

There were only two men left. 

And he’d found out that the cou- 
ple were going to New York and 
the tension had come and gone, 
loosened and tightened in a spastic 
rhythm as he knew, in his very flesh, 
that he was going to tell them to 
come and look at his zoo. 

I should have given them an in- 
jection, he thought. They might 
start screaming. It didn’t matter 
about the man, he was used to men 
screaming. But a woman . 

Merv Ketter opened his eyes and 
stared with hopeless eyes at the 
mantelpiece, at the picture of his 
dead wife, at the weapons which 
had been his glory and now were 
meaningless — steel and wood with- 
out worth, without substance. 

Hero . 

The word made his stomach turn. 

The glutinous pulsing slowed , 
paused a moment’s fraction, then 
began again, filling the inner shell 
with its hissing, spumous sound. A 
flaccid wave of agitation rippled 
down along the rows of muscle 

RICHARD MATHESON 



coils . The being stirred . It was time . 

Thought. The shapeless , gauze - 
airbubble coalesced; sur- 
rounded. The being moved, an un- 
dulation, a gelatinous worming 
within the shimmering bubble. A 
bumping, a slithering, a rocking 
flow of viscous tissues. 

Thought again — a wave direct- 
ing. The hiss of entering atmos- 
phere, the soundless swinging of 
metal. Open. Shutting with a click. 
Sunset’s blood edged the horizon. A 
slow and noiseless sinking in the 
air, a colorless balloon filled with 
something formless, something 
alive. 

Earth, cooling. The being 
touched it, settled. It moved across 
the ground and every living thing 
fled its scouring approach. In its 
ropy wake, the ground was left a 
green and yellow iridescence. 

“Look out.” 

Marian’s sudden whisper almost 
made him drop the nail file. He 
jerked back his hand, his sweat- 
grimed cheek twitching and drew 
back quickly into the shadows. The 
sun was almost down. 

“Is he coming this way?” Marian 
asked, her voice husky with dry- 
ness. 

“I don’t know.” He stood tense- 
ly, watching the overalled man ap- 
proach, hearing the fast crunch of 
his boot heels on the baked ground. 
He tried to swallow but all the mois- 
ture in him had been blotted up by 
the afternoon heat and only a futile 
clicking sounded in his throat. He 
was thinking about the man seeing 
the deeply-filed slit in the window 
bar. 

The man in the stetson walked 


quickly, his face blank and hard, 
his hands swinging in tense little 
arcs at his sides. 

“What’s he going to do?” 
Marian’s voice rasped nervously, 
her physical discomfort forgotten 
in the sudden return of fear. 

Les only shook his head. All after- 
noon he’d been asking himself the 
same question. After they’d been 
locked up, after the man had gone 
back to his house, during the first 
terrifying minutes and for the rest 
of the time when Marian had found 
the nail file in the pocket of her 
shorts and shapeless panic had 
gained the form of hoping for es- 
cape. All during that time the ques- 
tion had plagued him endlessly. 
What was the man going to do with 
them? 

But it wasn’t their cage the man 
was headed for. A loosening of re- 
lief made them both go slack. The 
man hadn’t even looked toward the 
cage they were in. He seemed to 
avoid looking toward it. 

Then the man had passed out of 
their sight and they heard the sound 
of him unlocking one of the cages. 
The squeaking rasp of the rusty 
door hinges made Les’s stomach 
muscles draw taut. 

The man appeared again. 

Marian caught her breath. They 
both stared at the unconscious man 
being dragged across the ground, 
his heels raking narrow gouges in 
the dust. 

After a few feet, the man let go 
of the limp arms and the body fell 
with a heavy thud. The man in the 
overalls looked behind him then, 
his head jerking around suddenly. 
They saw his throat move with a 
convulsive swallow. The man’s eyes 


BEING 


85 



moved quickly, looking in all di- 
rections. 

“What’s he looking for?” Marian 
asked in a shaking whisper. 

“Marian, I don’t know 33 

“He’s leaving him there!” She al- 
most whimpered the word. 

Their eyes filled with confused 
fear, they watched the overalled 
man move for the house again, his 
long legs pumping rapidly, his head 
moving jerkily as he looked from 
side to side. Dear God, what is he 
looking for? — Les thought in rising 
dread. 

The man suddenly twitched in 
mid-stride and clutched at his left 
arm. Then, abruptly, he broke into 
a frightened run and leaped up the 
porch steps two at a time. The 
screen door slapped shut behind 
him with a loud report and then 
everything was deadly still. 

A sob caught in Marian’s throat. 
“I’m afraid ” she said in a thin, 
shuddering voice. 

He was afraid too; he didn’t 
know of what but he was terribly 
afraid. Chilling uneasiness crawled 
up his back and rippled coldly on 
his neck. He kept staring at the 
body of the man sprawled on the 
ground, at the still, white face look- 
ing up sightlessly at the darkening 
sky. 

He jolted once as, across the yard, 
he heard the back door of the house 
being slammed shut and locked. 

S ILENCE. A great hanging pall 
of it that pressed down on them 
like lead. The man slumped motion- 
less on the ground. Their breaths 
quick, labored. Their lips trembling, 
their eyes fastened almost hypno- 

86 


tically on the man. 

Marian drew up one fist and dug 
her teeth into the knuckles. Sunlight 
rimmed the horizon with a scarlet 
ribbon. Soundlessness. Heavy 
soundlessness. 

Soundlessness. 

Sound. 

Their breath stopped. They stood 
there, mouths open, ears straining at 
the sound they’d never heard be- 
fore. Their bodies went rigid as 
they listened to — 

A bumping , a slithering , a rock- 
ing fl ow °f — 

“Oh, God! 3 ' Her voice was a 
gasping of breathless horror as she 
spun away, shaking hands flung 
over her eyes. 

It was getting dark and he 
couldn’t be sure of what he saw. He 
stood paralyzed and numb in the 
fetid air of the cage, staring with 
blood-drained face at the thing that 
moved across the ground toward the 
man’s body; the thing that had 
shape yet not shape, that crept like 
a current of shimmering jellies. 

A terrified gagging filled his 
throat. He tried to move bajk but 
he couldn’t. He didn’t want to see. 
He didn’t want to hear the hideous 
gurgling sound like water being 
sucked into a great drain, the turbid 
bubbling that was like vats of boil- 
ing tallow. 

No, his mind kept repeating, un- 
able to accept, no, no, no, no! 

Then the scream made them both 
jerk like boneless things and drove 
Marian against one of the cage 
walls, shaking with nauseous shock. 

And the man was gone from the 
earth. Les stared at the place where 
he had been, stared at the luminous 
mass that pulsated there like a great 

RICHARD MATHESON 



mound of balloon-encased plank- 
ton undulating palely in their fluids. 

He stared at it until the man had 
been completely eaten. 

Then he turned away on dead- 
ened legs and stumbled to Marian’s 
side. Her shaking fingers clutched 
like talons at his back and he felt 
her tear- streaked, twisted face press 
into his shoulder. Unfeelingly, he 
slid his arms around her, his face 
stiff with spent horror. Vaguely, 
through the body-clutching horror, 
he felt the need to comfort her, to 
ease her fright. 

But he couldn’t. He felt as if a 
pair of invisible claws had reached 
into his chest and ripped out all 
his insides. There wasn’t anything 
left, just a cold, frost-edged hollow 
in him. And, in the hollow, a knife 
jabbing its razor tip each time he 
realized again why they were there. 

When the scream came, Merv 
slammed both hands across his ears 
so hard it made his head ache. 

He couldn’t seem to cut off the 
sound anymore. Doors wouldn’t 
shut tightly enough, windows 
wouldn’t seal away the world, walls 
were to porous — the screams always 
reached him. 

Maybe it was because they were 
really in his mind where there were 
no doors to lock, no windows to 
shut and close away the screaming 
of terror. Yes, maybe they were in 
his mind. It would explain why he 
still heard them in his sleep. 

And, when it was over and Merv 
knew that the thing had gone, he 
trudged slowly into the kitchen and 
opened the door. Then, like a robot 
driven by remorseless gears, he went 
to the calendar and circled the date. 


Sunday, August 22nd. 

The eighth man. 

The pencil dropped from his 
slack fingers and rolled across the 
linoleum. Sixteen days — one man 
each two days for sixteen days. The 
mathematics of it were simple. The 
truth was not. 

He paced the living room, passing 
in and out of the lamplight aura 
which cast a buttery glow across his 
exhausted features, then melted 
away as he moved into shadow 



again. Sixteen days. It seemed like 
sixteen years since he’d gone out 
into the desert to hunt for jackrab- 
bits. Had it only been sixteen days 
ago? 

Once again he saw the scene 
within his mind; it never left. Him 
scuffing across late afternoon sands, 
shotgun cradled against his hip, 
head slowly turning, eyes search- 
ing beneath the brim of his hat. 

Then, moving over the crest of a 
scrub-grown dune, stopping with a 

87 


BEING 




gasp, his eyes staring up at the globe 
which shimmered like a light im- 
mersed in water. His heartbeat jolt- 
ing, every muscle tensing abruptly 
at the sight. 

Approaching then, standing al- 
most below the luminescent sphere 
that caught the lowering sun rays 
redly. 

A gasp tearing back -his lips at the 
circular cavity appearing on the 
surface of the globe. And out of the 
cavity floating — 

He’d spun then and run, his 
breath whistling as he scram- 
bled frantically up the rise again, 
his boot heels gouging at the sand. 
Topping the rise, he’d started to 
run in long, panic-driven strides, 
the gun held tautly in his right 
hand, banging against his leg. 

Then the sound overhead — like 
the noise of gas escaping. Wild- 
eyed, he’d looked up over his shoul- 
der. A terrified cry had wrenched 
his face into a mask of horror. 

Ten feet over his head, the bul- 
bous glow floated. 

Merv lunged forward, his legs 
rising high as he fled. A fetid heat 
blew across his back. He looked up 
again with terrified eyes to see the 
thing descending on him. Seven 
feet above him — six — five — 

Merv Ketter skidded to his knees, 
twisted around, jerked up the shot- 
gun. The silence of the desert was 
shattered by the blast. 

A gagging scream ripped from 
his throat as shot sprayed off the 
lucent bubble like pebbles off a rub- 
ber ball. He felt some of it burrow 
into his shoulder and arm as he 
flung over to one side, the gun fall- 
ing from his nerveless grip. Four 
feet — three— the heat surrounded 

88 


him, the choking odor made the 
air swim before his eyes. 

His arms flung up. “NO!” 

Once he had jumped into a wa- 
ter hole without looking and been 
mired on the shallow bottom by 
hot slime. It felt like that now, only 
this time the ooze was jumping 
onto him. His screams were lost in 
the crawling sheath of gasses and 
his flailing limbs caught fast in 
glutinous tissue. Around his terror- 
frozen eyes, he saw an agitating 
gelatine filled with gyrating span- 
gles. Horror pressed at his skull, he 
felt death sucking at his life. 

But he didn’t die. 

He inhaled and there was air 
even though the air was grumous 
with a stomach-wrenching stench. 
His lungs labored, he gagged as he 
breathed. 

Then something moved in his 
brain. 

He tried to twist and tried to 
scream but he couldn’t. It felt like 
vipers threading through his brain, 
gnawing with poisoned teeth on tis- 
sues of his thought. 

The serpents coiled and tight- 
ened. I could kill yotl now — the 
words scalded like acid. The muscle 
cords beneath his face tensed but 
even they couldn’t move in the 
putrescent glue. 

And then more words had 
formed and were burning, were 
branding themselves indelibly into 
his mind. 

You will get me food. 

He was still shuddering now, 
standing before the calendar, star- 
ing at the penciled circles. 

What else could he have done? 
The question pleaded like a grovel- 
ing suppliant. The being had picked 

RICHARD MATHESON 



his mind clean. It knew about his 
home, his station, his wife, his past. 
It told him what to do, it left no 
choice. He had to do it. Would 
anyone have let themselves die like 
that if they had an alternative ; 
would anyone ? Wouldn’t anyone 
have promised the world itself to 
be freed of that horror? 

Grim-faced, trembling, he went 
up the stairs on feeble legs, know- 
ing there would be no sleep, but go- 
ing anyway. 

Slumped down on the bed, one 
shoe off, he stared with lifeless eyes 
at the floor, at the hooked rug that 
Elsie had made so long ago. 

Yes, he’d promised to do what 
the being had ordered. And the be- 
ing had sunk the tiny, whirring 
cone deep into his arm so that he 
could only escape by cutting open 
his own flesh and dying. 

And then the hideous gruel had 
vomited him onto the desert sands 
and he had lain there, mute and 
palsied while the being had raised 
slowly from the earth. And he had 
heard in his brain the last warn- 
ing— 

In two days . 

And it had started, the endless, 
enervating round of trapping in- 
nocent people in order to preserve 
himself from the fate he knew 
awaited them. 

And the horrible thing, the truly 
horrible thing was that he knew he 
would do it again. He knew he’d do 
anything to keep the being away 
from him. Even if it meant that the 
woman must — 

His mouth tightened. His eyes 
shut and he sat trembling without 
control on the bed. 

What would he do when the 


couple were gone? What would he 
do if no one else came to the sta- 
tion? What would he do if the po- 
lice came checking on the disap- 
pearances of eleven people? 

His shoulders twisted and an an- 
guished sobbing pulsed in his 
throat. 

Before he lay down he took a 
long swallow from the dwindling 
whiskey bottle. He lay in the dark- 
ness, a nerve-scraped coil, waiting, 
the small pool of heat in his stom- 
ach unable to warm the coldness 
and the emptiness of him. 

In his arm the cone whirled. 


L ES JERKED out the last bar 
J and stood there for a moment, 
head slumped forward on his chest, 
panting through clenched teeth, his 
body heaving with exhausted 
breath. Every muscle in his back 
and shoulders and arms ached with 
throbbing pain. 

Then he sucked in a rasping 
breath. “Let’s go,” he gasped. 

His arms vibrated as he helped 
Marian clamber through the win- 
dow. 

“Don’t make any noise.” He 
could hardly speak he was so tired 
from the combination of thirst, hun- 
ger, heat exhaustion and seemingly 
endless, muscle-cramped filing. 

He couldn’t get his leg up, he had 
to go through the rough-edged 
opening head first, pushing and 
squirming, feeling splinters jab into 
his sweat-greased flesh. When he 
thudded down, the pain of impact 
ran jaggedly along his extended 
arms and, for a second, the dark- 
ness swam with needles of light. 
Marian helped him up.

“Let’s go/’ he said again, breath- 
lessly and they started to run across 
the ground toward the front of the 
house. 

Abruptly, he grabbed her wrist 
and jerked her to a halt. 

“Get those sandals off,” he or- 
dered hoarsely. She bent over quick- 
ly and unbuckled them. 

The house was dark as they hur- 
ried around the back corner of it 
and dashed along the side be- 
neath the moon-reflecting windows. 
Marian winced as her right foot 
jarred down on a sharp pebble. 

“Thank God,” Les gasped to 
himself as they reached the front 
of the house. 

The car was still there. As they 
ran toward it, he felt into his back 
pocket and took out his wallet. His 
shaking fingers reached into the 
small change purse and felt the 
coolness of the extra ignition key. 
He was sure the other keys wouldn’t 
be in the car. 

They reached it. 

“Quick” he gasped and they 
pulled open the doors and slid in. 
Les suddenly realized that he was 
shivering in the chilly night air. He 
took out the key and fumbled for 
the ignition slot. They’d left the 
doors open, planning to close them 
when the motor started. 

Les found the slot and slid in the 
key, then drew in a tense, shudder- 
ing breath. If the man had done 
- anything to the motor, they were 
lost. 

“Here goes,” he murmured and 
jabbed at the starter button. 

The motor coughed and turned 
over once with a groan. Les’s throat 
clicked convulsively, he jerked back 
his hand and threw an apprehen- 

90 


sive look at the dark house. 

“Oh God, won’t it start?” Mari- 
an whispered, feeling her legs and 
arms break out in gooseflesh. 

“I don’t know, I hope it’s just 
cold,” he said hurriedly. He caught 
his breath, then pushed in the but- 
ton again, pumping at the choke. 

The motor turned again lethargi- 
cally. Oh God, he has done some- 
thing to it! — the words exploded 
in Les’s mind. He jammed in the 
button feverishly, his body tense 
with fear. Why didn’t we push it 
to the main road! — the new 
thought came, deepening the lines 
on his face. 

“Les!” 

He felt her hand clutch at his 
arm and, almost instinctively, his 
gaze jerked over to the house. 

A light had flared up at a sec- 
ond story window. 

“Oh Jesus, start!” he cried in a 
broken frenzy and pushed at the 
button with a rigid thumb. 

The motor coughed into life and 
a wave of relief covered him. Si- 
multaneously, he and Marian 
pulled at the doors and slammed 
them shut while he gunned the en- 
gine strongly to get it warm. 

As he threw the gears into first, 
the head and trunk of the man ap- 
peared in the window. He shouted 
something but neither ‘"of them 
heard of it over the roar of the 
motor. 

The car jerked forward and 
stalled. 

Les hissed in impotent fury as he 
jabbed in the button again. The 
motor caught and he eased up the 
clutch. The tires bumped over the 
uneven ground. Upstairs, the man 
was gone from the window and 

RICHARD MATHESON 



Marian, her eyes fastened to the 
house, saw a downstairs light go on. 

“Hurry!” she begged. 

The car picked up speed and 
Les, shoving the gears into second, 
jerked the car into a tight semi- 
circle. The tires skidded on the 
hard earth and, as the car headed 
for the lane, Les threw it into third 
and jerked at the knob that sent the 
two headlights splaying out bright- 
ly into the darkness. 

Behind them, something ex- 
ploded and they both jerked their 
shoulders forward convulsively as 
something gouged across the roof 
with a grating shriek. Les shoved 
the accelerator to the floor and the 
car leaped forward, plunging and 
rocking into the rutted lane. 

Another shotgun blast tore open 
the night and half of the back win- 
dow exploded in a shower of glass 
splinters. Again, their shoulders 
twitched violently and Les grunted 
as a sliver gouged its razor edge 
across the side of his neck. 

His hands jerked on the wheel, 
the car hit a small ditch and almost 
veered into a bank on the left side 
of the lane. His fingers tightened 
convulsively and, with arms braced, 
he pulled the car back into the cen- 
ter of the lane, crying to Marian, 

“Where is he?’ 5 

Her white face twisted around. 

“I can’t see him!” 

His throat moved quickly as the 
car bucked and lurched over the 
holes, the headlights jerking wildly 
with each motion. 

Get to the next town, he thought 
wildly, tell the sheriff, try and save 
that other poor devil. His foot 
pressed down on the pedal as the 
lane smoothed out. Get to the next 


town and — 

She screamed it. “Look out!” 

He couldn’t stop in time. The 
hood of the Ford drove splintering 
into the heavy gate across the lane' 
and the car jolted to a neck- jerk- 
ing halt. Marian went flailing for- 
ward against the dashboard, the 
side of her head snapping against 
the windshield. The engine stalled 
and both headlights smashed out in 
an instant. 

Les shoved away from the steer- 
ing wheel, knocked breathless by 
the impact. 

“Honey, quick ” he gasped. 

A choking sob shook in Marian’s 
throat. “My head, my head” Les 
sat in stunned muteness a moment, 
staring at her as she twisted her 
head around in an agony of pain, 
one hand pressed rigidly to her 
forehead. 

Then he shoved open the door at 
his side and grabbed for her free 
hand. “Marian, we have to get out 
of here!” 

She kept crying helplessly as he 
almost dragged her from the car 
and threw his arm around her waist 
to support her. Behind him, he 
heard the sound of heavy boots 
running down the lane and saw, 
over his shoulder, a bright flash- 
light eye bobbing as it bore down 
on them. 

Marian collapsed at the gate. Les 
stood there holding her, trembling 
impotently as the man came run- 
ning up, a forty-five clutched in his 
right hand, a flashlight in his left. 
Les winced at the beam flaring into 
his eyes. 

“Back,” was all the man said, 
panting heavily and Les saw the 
barrel of the gun wave once toward 


BEING 


91 



the house. 

“But my wife is hurt ! 33 he said, 
“She hit her head against the wind- 
shield. You can’t just put her back 
in a cage ! 33 

“I said get back ! 30 The man’s 
shout made Les start. 

“But she can’t walk, she’s un- 
conscious!” 

He heard a rasping breath shud- 
der through the man’s body and 
saw that he was stripped to the 
waist and shivering. 

“Garry her then,” the man said. 

“But—” 

“Shall I blast ya where ya stand!” 
the man yelled in a frenzied anger. 

“No. No.” Les shook nervously as 
he lifted up Marian’s slack body. 
The man stepped aside and Les 
started back up the lane, trying to 
watch Marian’s face and his foot- 
ing at the same time. 

“Honey,” he whispered, “Mari- 
an ? ” 

Her head hung limply over his 
left forearm, the short blond hair 
ruffling against her temples and 
brow as he walked. Tension kept 
building up in him until he felt like 
screaming. 

“Why are you doing this?” he 
suddenly blurted out over his 
shoulder. 

No answer, just the rhythmic 
slogging of the man’s boots over the 
pocked ground. 

“How can you do this to any- 
one?” Les asked brokenly, “Trap- 
ping your own kind and giving 
them to that — that God only knows 
what it is!” 

<l Shut up!” But there was more 
defeat than anger in the man’s 
voice. 

“Look,” Les said suddenly, im- 

92 


pulsively, “Let my wife go. Keep 
me here if you have to but . but 
let her go. Please ! 33 

The man said nothing and Les 
bit his lips in frustrated anguish. He 
looked down at Marian with sick, 
frightened eyes. 

“Marian,” he said, “Marian . 33 
He shivered violently in the cold 
night air. 

The house loomed up bleakly out 
of the flat darkness of the desert. 

“For God’s sake, don’t put her 
in a cage!” he cried out desperately. 

“Get back 33 The man’s voice was 
flat, there was nothing in it, neither 
promise nor emotion. 

Les stiffened. If it had been just 
him, he would have whirled and 
leaped at the man, he knew it. He 
wouldn’t, willingly, walk back past 
the edge of the house again, back 
toward the cages, toward that 
thing. 

But there was Marian. 

He stepped over the thrown- 
down shotgun on the ground and 
heard, behind him, the grunt of the 
man as he bent over and picked it 
up. I have to get her out of here, he 
thought, I have to! 

It happened before he could do 
anything. He heard the man step 
up suddenly behind him and then 
felt a pinprick on his right shoulder. 
He caught his breath at the sudden 
sting and turned as quickly as he 
could, weighed down by Marian’s 
dead limpness. 

“What are you — ” 

He couldn’t even finish the sen- 
tence. It seemed suddenly as if hot, 
numbing liquors were being hosed 
through his veins. An immense 
lassitude covered his limbs and he 
hardly felt it when the man took 

RICHARD MATHESON 



Marian from his arms. 

He stumbled forward a step, the 
night alive with glittering pinpoints 
of light. The earth ran like water 
beneath his feet, his legs turned to 
rubber. 

“No” He said it in a lethargic 
grumble. 

Then he toppled. And didn’t 
even feel the impact of the ground 
against his falling body. 

The belly of the globe was warm . 
It undulated with a thick and 
vaporous heat. In the humid dim- 
ness, the being rested, its shapeless 
body quivering with monotonous 
pulsations of sleep. The being was 
comfortable, it was content, coiled 
grotesquely like some cosmic cat 
before a hearth. 

For two days. 

P IERCING screams woke him. 

He stirred fitfully and moved 
his lips as though to speak. But his 
lips were made of iron. They sagged 
inertly and he couldn’t move them. 
Only a great forcing of will would 
raise his leaden eyelids. 

The cage air fluttered and shim- 
mered with strange convections. 
His eyes blinked slowly; glazed, un- 
comprehending eyes. His hands 
flopped weakly at his sides like 
dying fish. 

It was the man in the other cage 
screaming. The poor devil had 
come out of his drugged state and 
was hysterical because he knew. 

Les’s sweat-grimed brow wrin- 
kled slowly, evenly. He could think. 
His body was like a massive stone, 
unwieldy and helpless. But, behind 
its flint, immobile surface, his brain 

BEING 


was just as sure. 

His eyes fell shut. That made it 
all the more horrible. To know 
what was coming. To lie there help- 
less and know what was going to 
happen to him. 

He thought he shuddered, but he 
wasn’t sure. That thing, what was 
it? There was nothing in knowl- ; 
edge to construct from, no founda- 
tion of rational acceptance to build 
upon. What he’d seen that night 
was something beyond all — 

What day was it? Where was — 

Marian ! 

It was like rolling a boulder to 
turn his head. Clicking filled his 
throat, saliva dribbled unnoticed 
from the corners of his mouth. 
Again, he forced his eyes open with 
a great straining of will. 

Panic drove knife blades into his 
brain even though his face changed 
not at all. 

Marian wasn’t there. 

She lay, limply drugged, on the 
bed. He’d laid another cool, wet 
cloth across her brow, across the 
welt on her right temple. 

Now he stood silently, looking 
down at her. He’d just gotten back 
from the cages where he’d injected 
the screaming man again to quiet 
him. He wondered what was in the 
drug that being had given him, he 
wondered what it did to the man. 
He hoped it made him completely 
insensible. 

It was the man’s last day. 

No, it’s dumb imagination, he 
told himself suddenly. She didn’t 
look like Elsie, she didn’t look at 
all like Elsie. 

It was his mind. He wanted her 
to look like Elsie, that was what it 

93 



was. His throat twitched as he swal- 
lowed. Stupid. The word slapped 
dully at his brain. She didn’t look 
like Elsie. 

For a moment, he let his gaze 
move once more over the woman’s 
body, at the smooth rise of her bust, 
the willowy hips, the long, well- 
formed legs. Marian. That was 
what the man had called her. 
Marian. 

It was a nice name. 

With an angry twist of his shoul- 
ders, he turned away from the bed 
and strode quickly from the room. 
What was the matter with him any- 
way? What did he think he was go- 
ing to do — let her go? There had 
been no sense in taking her into the 
house the night before last, in put- 
ting her in the spare bedroom. No 
sense in it at all. He couldn’t let 
himself feel sympathy for her, for 
anyone. If he did, he was lost. That 
was obvious. 

As he moved down the steps, he 
tried to remind himself once more 
of the horror of being absorbed into 
that gelatinous mass. He tried to 
remember the brain-searing terror 
of it. But, somehow, the memory 
kept disappearing like wind-blown 
cloud and he kept thinking instead 
of the woman. Marian. She did 
look like Elsie ; the same color hair, 
the same mouth. 

No! 

He’d leave her in the bedroom 
until the drug wore off. Then he’d 
put her back in the cage again. It’s 
me or them ! — he argued furiously 
with himself. I ain’t going to die 
like that! Not for anyone. 

He kept arguing with himself all 
the way down to the station. 

I must be crazy, he thought, tak- 

94 


ing her in the house like that, feel- 
ing sorry for her. I can’t afford it, I 
can’t. She’s just two days to me, 
that’s all, just a two-day reprieve 
from — 

The station was empty, silent. 
Merv braked the truck and got out. 

His boots crunched over the hot 
earth as he paced restlessly around 
the pumps. I can’t let her go! he 
lashed out at himself, his face taut 
with fury. He shuddered then at 
the realization that he had been en- 
tertaining the thought for two days 
now. 

“Why wasn’t she a man?” he 
muttered to himself, fists tight and 
blood-drained at his sides. He 
raised his left arm and looked at 
the reddish lump. Why couldn’t he 
tear it out of his flesh? Why? 

The car came then. A salesman’s 
car, dusty and hot. 

As Merv pumped gas in, as he 
checked the oil and water, he kept 
glancing from under his hat brim 
at the hot-faced little man in the 
linen suit and panama hat. Replace 
her. Merv wouldn’t let the thought 
out yet he knew it was there. He 
found himself glancing down at the 
license plate. 

Arizona. 

His face tightened. No. No, he’d 
always gotten out-of-state cars, it 
was safer that way. I’ll have to let 
him go, he thought miserably, I’ll 
have to. I can’t afford to. 

But when the little man was 
reaching into his wallet, Merv felt 
his hand slide back to his back over- 
all pocket, he felt his fingers tighten 
over the warm butt of the forty- 
five. 

The little man stared, slack- 
jawed, at the big gun. 

RICHARD MATHESON 



“What is this?” he asked weakly. 
Merv didn’t tell him. 

Night brushed its black iced fin- 
gers across the moving bubble. 
Earth flowed beneath its liquid 
coming. 

Why was the air so f aint with 
nourishment , why did the atmos- 
phere press so feebly in? This land, 
it was a weak, a dying land, its life- 
administering gasses almost spent. 

Amidst slithering, amidst scour- 
ing approach, the being thought of 
escape. 

How long now had it been here 
in this barren place? There was no 
way of telling for the planet’s sun 
appeared and disappeared with in- 
sane rapidity, darkness and light 
flickering in alternation like the 
wink of an eye . 

And, on the ship, the instruments 
of chronometry were shattered, 
they were irreparable. There was 
no context any more, no customed 
metric to adjust by. The being was 
lost upon this tenuous void of liv- 
ing rock, unable to do more than 
forage for its sustenance. 

Off in the black distance, the 
dwelling of the planet’s animal ap- 
peared, grotesquely angular and 
peaked. It was a stupid animal, this 
brainless beast incapable of ration- 
ality, able only to emit wild 
squawking cries and flap its tendrils 
like the night plants of his own 
world. And its body — it was too 
hard with calciumed rigidity, pro- 
viding scant nutriment, making it 
necessary for the being to eat twice 
as often so violent an energy did di- 
gestion take. 

Closer. The clicking grew louder . 

The animal was there, as usual , 


lying still upon the ground, its ten- 
drils curled and limp. The being 
shot out threads of thought and 
sapped the sluggish juices of 
thought from the animal. It was a 
, barbaric place if this was its intelli- 
gence. The being heaved closer, 
swelling and sucking along the 
wind-swept earth. 

The animal stirred and deep re- 
vulsion quivered in the being’s 
mind. If it were not starving and 
helpless it could never force itself 
to absorb this twitching, stiff-ribbed 
beast. 

Bubble touched tendril. The be- 
ing flowed across the animal form 
and trembled to a stop. Visual cells 
revealed the animal looking up, dis- 
tended eyed. Audial cells trans- 
ferred the wild and strangling noise 
the dying animal made. Tactile 
cells absorbed the flimsy agitations 
of its body. 

And, in its deepest ce?iter, the be- 
ing sensed the tireless clicking that 
emanated from the dark lair where, 
hidden and shaking, the first ani- 
mal was — the animal in whose 
flaccid tendril was imbedded the 
location cone. 

The being ate. And, eating, won- 
dered if there would ever be enough 
food to keep it alive — 

— for the thousand earth years 
of its life. 

He lay slumped across the cage 
floor, his heartbeat jolting as the 
man looked in at him. 

He’d been testing the walls when 
he heard the slap of the screen 
door and the sound of the man’s 
boots descending the porch steps. 
He’d lunged down and rolled over 
quickly onto his back, trying des- 


95 


BEING 



perately to remember what position 
he’d been in while he was still 
drugged, arranging his hands limp- 
ly at his sides, drawing up his right 
leg a little, closing his eyes. The 
man mustn’t know that he was con- 
scious. The man had to open the 
door without caution. 

Les forced himself to breathe 
slowly and evenly even though it 
made his stomach hurt. The man 
made no sound as he gazed in. 
When he opens the lock, Les kept 
telling himself — as soon as I hear 
the door pulled open, I’ll jump. 

His throat moved once as a nerv- 
ous shudder rippled through him. 
Gould the man tell he was faking? 
His muscles tensed, waiting for the 
sound of the door opening. He had 
to get away now. 

There would be no other time. 
It was coming tonight. 

Then the sound of the man’s 
boots started away. Abruptly, Les 
opened his eyes, a look of shocked 
disbelief contorting his features. 
The man wasn’t going to open the 
cage! 

For a long time he lay there, 
shivering, staring up mutely at the 
barred window where the man had 
stood. He felt like crying aloud and 
beating his fists against the door 
until they were bruised and bleed- 
ing. 

“No . no” His voice was a life- 
less mumble. 

Finally, he pushed up and got on 
his knees. Cautiously, he looked 
over the rim of the window. The 
man was gone. 

He crouched back down and 
went through his pockets again. 

His wallet — nothing there to 
help him. His handkerchief, the 

96 


stub of pencil, forty-seven cents, his 
comb. 

Nothing else. 

He held the articles in his palms 
and stared down at them for long 
moments as if, somehow, they held 
the answer to his terrible need. 
There had to be an answer, it was 
inconceivable that he should ac- 
tually end up out there on the 
ground like that other man, put 
there for that thing to — 

“No!” 

With a spasmodic twitch of his 
hands, he flung the articles onto 
the dirt floor of the cage, his lips 
drawn back in a dull cry of fright- 
ened outrage. It can’t be real, it has 
to be a dream! 

He fell to his knees desperately 
and once more began running shak- 
ing fingers over the sides of the 
cage, looking for a crack, a weak 
board, anything. 

And, while he searched in vain, 
he tried not to think about the 
night coming and what the night 
was going to bring. 

But that was all he could think 
about. 

S HE SAT UP, gasping, as the 
man’s calloused fingers stroked 
at her hair. Her widened eyes 
stared at him in horror as he jerked 
back his hand. 

“Elsie,” he muttered. 

The whiskey-heavy cloud of his 
breath poured across her face and 
she drew back, grimacing, her 
hands clutching tensely at the bed- 
spread. 

“Elsie.” He said it again, thick 
voiced, his glazed eyes looking at 
her drunkenly. 

RICHARD MATHESON 



The bedspread rustled beneath 
her as she pushed back further un- 
til her back bumped against the 
wooden headboard. 

“Elsie, I didn’t mean to,” the 
man said, dark blades of hair hang- 
ing down over his temples, breath 
falling hotly from his open mouth, 
“Elsie, don’t . don’t be scared of 
me. 

“W-where’s my husband?” 

“Elsie, you look like Elsie,” the 
man slurred the words, his blood- 
streaked eyes pleading, “You look 
like Elsie, oh . God , you look 
like Elsie.” 

“Where’s my husband!” 

His hand clamped over her wrist 
and she felt herself jerked like a 
flimsy doll against the man’s chest. 
His stale breath surrounded her. 

“No” she gasped, her hands 
pushing at his shoulders. 

“I love ya, Elsie, I love ya!” 

“Les!” Her scream rang out in 
the small room. 

Her head snapped to the side as 
the man’s big palm drove across 
her cheek. 

“He’s dead!” the man shouted 
hoarsely, “It ate him, it ate him! 
You hear!” 

She fell back against the head- 
board, her eyes stark with horror. 
“No” She didn’t even know she’d 
spoken. 

The man struggled up to his feet 
and stood there weaving, looking 
down at her blank face. 

“You think I wanted to?” he 
asked brokenly, a tear dribbling 
down his beard-darkened cheek, 
“You think I liked to do it?” A sob 
shuddered in his chest. “I didn’t 
like to do it. But you don’t know, 
y-you don’t know . I was in it, I 

BEING 



was in it! Oh God . you don’t 
know what it was like. You don’t 
know!” 

He sank down heavily on the 
bed, his head slumped forward, his 
chest racked with helpless sobs. 

“I didn’t want to. God, do you 
think I w -wanted to?” 

Her left fist was pressed rigidly 
against her lips. She couldn’t seem 
to breathe. No. Her mind struggled 
to disbelieve. No, it’s not true, it 
isn’t true. 

Suddenly, she threw her legs 
over the side of the bed and stood. 
Outside, the sun was going down. 
It doesn’t come till dark, her mind 
argued desperately, not until dark. 
But how long had she been un- 
conscious? 

The man looked up with red- 
rimmed eyes. “What are ya doing?” 

She started running for the door. 

As she jerked open the door, the 
man collided with her and the two 
of them went crashing against the 
wall. Breath was driven from her 

97 



body and the ache in her head 
flared up again. The man clutched 
at her; she felt his hands running 
wildly over her chest and shoulders. 

“Elsie, Elsie. .” the man gasped, 
trying to kiss her again. 

That was when she saw the 
heavy pitcher on the table beside 
them. She hardly felt his tightening 
fingers, his hard, brutal mouth 
crushed against hers. Her stretch- 
ing fingers closed over the pitcher 
handle, she lifted. 

Great chunks of the white pot- 
tery showered on the floor as the 
man’s cry of pain filled the room. 

Then Marian was leaning against 
the wall, gasping for breath and 
looking down at his crumpled body, 
at his thick fingers still twitching 
on the rug. 

Suddenly her eyes fled to the 
window. Almost sunset. 

Abruptly, she ran back to the 
man and bent over his motionless 
body. Her shaking fingers felt 
through his overall pockets until 
they found the ring of keys. 

As she fled from the room, she 
heard the man groan and saw, over 
her shoulder, the fleeting sight of 
him turning slowly onto his back. 

She ran down the hall and jerked 
open the front door. Dying sunlight 
flooded the sky with its blood. 

With a choking gasp, she jumped 
down the porch steps and ran in 
desperate, erratic strides around 
the house, not even feeling the 
pebbles her feet ran over. She kept 
looking at the silent row of cages 
she was running toward. It’s not 
true, it’s not true — the words kept 
running through her brain — he 
lied to me. A sob pulled back her 
lips. He lied! 

98 


Darkness was falling like* a rapid 
curtain as she dashed up to the first 
cage on trembling legs. 

Empty. 

Another sob pulsed in her throat. 
She ran to the next cage. He was 
lying! 

Empty. 

“No” 

“ Les !” 

“Marian!” He leaped across the 
cage floor, a sudden wild hope 
flashing across his face. 

“Oh, darling” Her voice was a 
shaking, strengthless murmur, “He 
told me — ” 

“Marian, open the cage. Hurry! 
It’s coming ” 

Dread fell over her again, a 
wave of numbing cold. Her head 
jerked to the side instinctively, her 
shocked gaze fled out across the 
darkening desert. 

“Marian!” 

Her hands shook uncontrollably 
as she tried one of the keys in the 
lock. It didn’t fit. She bit her lip 
until pain flared up. She tried an- 
other key. It didn’t fit. 

“Hurry” 

“Oh God.” She whimpered as 
her palsied hands inserted another 
key. That didn’t fit. 

“I can’t find the — ” 

Suddenly, her voice choked off, 
her breath congealed. In a second, 
she felt her limbs petrify. 

In the silence, faintly, a sound of 
something huge grating, and hiss- 
ing over the earth. 

“Oh, no” She looked aside hur- 
riedly, then back at Les again. 

“It’s all right, baby,” he said. 
“All right, don’t get excited. 
There’s plenty of time.” He drew 
in a heavy breath. “Try the next 

RICHARD MATHESON 



key. That’s right. No, no, the other 
one. It’s all right now. There. No, 
that doesn’t work. Try the next 
one.” His stomach kept contract- 
ing into a tighter, harder knot. 

The skin of Marian’s lower lip 
broke beneath her teeth. She 
winced and dropped the key ring. 
With a gagging whimper, she bent 
over and snatched it up. Across the 
desert, the wheezing, squashing 
sound grew louder. 

“Oh, Les, I can’t, I can’t!” 

“All right, baby,” he heard him- 
self say suddenly, “Never mind. 
Run for the highway.” 

She looked up at him, suddenly 
expressionless. “What?” 

“Honey, don’t stand there for 
God’s sake!” he cried, “Run!” 

She caught the breath that shook 
in her and dug her teeth again 
into the jagged break on her lip. 
Her hands stopped shaking and, 
almost numbed, she tried the next 
key, the next, while Les stood 
watching her with terrified eyes, 
looking over her shoulder toward 
the desert. 

“Honey, don’t—” 

The lock sprang open. With a 
breathless grunt, Les shoved open 
the door and grabbed Marian’s 
hand as the lathing sibilance shook 
in the twilight air. 

“Run!” he gasped, “Don’t look 
back!” 

They ran on wildly pumping legs 
away from the cages, away from the 
six-foot high mass of quivering life 
that flopped into the clearing like 
gelatine dumped from a gargan- 
tuan bowl. They tried not to lis- 
ten, they kept their eyes straight 
ahead, they ran without breaking 
their long, panic-driven strides. 


The car was back in front of the 
house again, it’s front bashed in. 
They jerked open the doors and 
slid in frantically. His shaking hand 
felt the key still in the ignition. He 
turned it and jabbed in the starter 
button. 

“Les, it’s coming this way!” 

The gears ground together with 
a loud rasp and the car jerked for- 
ward. He didn’t look behind, he 
just changed gears and kept push- 
ing down on the accelerator until 
the car lurched into the lane again. 

I ES TURNED the car right 
■^and headed for the town he 
remembered passing through — it 
seemed like years before. He 
pushed the gas pedal to the floor 
and the car picked up speed. He 
couldn’t see the road clearly with- 
out the headlights but he couldn’t 
keep his foot up, it seemed to jam 
itself down on the accelerator. The 
car roared down the darkening 
road and Les drew in his first easy 
breath in four days as. 

the being foamed and rocked 
across the ground , fury boiling in 
its tissues . The animal had failed , 
there was no food waiting , the food 
had gone. The being slithered in 
angry circles, searching, its visual 
cells picking at the ground, its 
sheathed and luminous formless- 
ness scouring away the flaky dirt. 
Nothing. The being gurgled like a 
viscid tide for the house, for the 
clicking sound in , 

Merv Ketter’s arm jerked spas- 
modically and he sat up, eyes wide 
and staring. Pain drove jagged lines 


BEING

of consciousness into his brain — 
pain in his head, pain in his arm. 
The cone was like a burrowing 
spider there, clawing with razor 
legs, trying to cut its way out of his 
flesh. Merv struggled up to his 
knees, teeth gritted together, eyes 
clouding with the pain. 

He had barely gained his feet 
when the crashing, splintering 
sound shook the house. He twitched 
violently, his lower jaw dropping. 
The digging, gouging fire in his arm 
increased and, suddenly he knew. 
With a whining gasp, he leaped 
into the hall and looked down the 
dark stairway pit. 

the being undulated up the stairs , 
its seventy ingot eyes glowering , its 
shimmering deformity lurching up 
toward the animal. Maddened fury 
hissed and bubbled through its 
amorphous shape, it flopped and 
flung itself up the angular steps . 
The animal turned and fled toward 

the back steps! — it was his only 
chance. He couldn’t breathe, air 
seemed liquid in his lungs. His boot 
heels hammered down the hall and 
through the darkness of his bed- 
room. Behind, he heard the railings 
buckle and snap as the being 
reached the second floor, bent it- 
self around into a U-shaped blad- 
der, then threw its sodden form for- 
ward again. 

Merv flung himself down the 
steep stairway, his palsied hand 
gripping at the railing, his heart- 
beat pounding at his chest like mal- 
let blows. He cried out hoarsely as 
the pain in his arm flared again, 
almost making him lose conscious- 
ness. 

100 


As he reached the bottom -step, 
he heard the doorway of his bed- 
room shattered violently and heard 
the gushing fury of the being as it 

heaved and bucked into the 
backstair doorway and smashed it 
out to its own size. Below, it heard 
the pounding of the fleeing animal. 
Then adhesiveness lost hold and 
the being went grinding and roll- 
ing down the stairway, its seven 
hundred feelers pricking the casing 
and scraping at the splintering 
wood. 

It hit the bottom step, crushed 
its huge misshapen bulk through 
the doorway and boiled across the 
kitchen floor. 

In the living room Merv dashed 
for the mantel. Reaching up, he 
jerked down the Mauser rifle and 
whirled as the distended being cas- 
caded its luminescent body through 
the doorway. 

The room echoed and rang with 
sharp explosions as Merv emptied 
the rifle into the onrushing hulk. 
The bullets sprayed off its casing 
impotently and Merv jumped back 
with a scream of terror, the gun 
flung from his hands. His outflung 
arm knocked off the picture of his 
wife and he heard it shatter on the 
floor and, in his twisted mind, had 
the fleeting vision of it lying on the 
floor, Elsie’s face smiling behind 
jagged glass. 

Then his hand closed over some- 
thing hard. And, suddenly, he knew 
exactly what to do. 

As the glittering mass reared up 
and threw its liquidity toward him, 
Merv jumped to the side. The 
mantel splintered, the wall cracked 

RICHARD MATHESON 



open. 

Then, as the being pulled itself 
up again and heaved over him, 
Merv jerked out the pin of the 
grenade and held it tightly to his 
chest. 

Stupid beast! I’ll kill you now 
for — 

PAIN ! ! 

Tissues exploded , the casing split , 
the being ran across the floor like 
slag , a molten torrent of proto- 
plasms. 

Then silence in the room . The 
being's minds snuffed out one by 
one as tenuous atmosphere starved 
each tissue of its life. The remains 
trembled slightly, agony flooded 


through the being's cells and glu- 
tinous joints . Thoughts trickled. 

Vital fluids trickling . Lamp 
beams giving warmth and life to 
pulsing matter. Organisms joining, 
cells dividing, the undulant con- 
tents of the food vat swelling , swell- 
ing, overpowering. Where are they! 
Where are the masters who gave me 
life that I might feed them and 
never lose my bulk or energy ? 

And then the being, which was 
born of tumorous hydroponics, died, 
having forgotten that it, itself, had 
eaten the masters as they slept, in- 
gesting, with their bodies, all the 
knowledge of their minds. 

• • • THE END 


WORTH CITING 

A NEW mark in the long history of communications is the first trans- 
ocean telephone cable. Stretched 2,300 miles across the ocean floor from 
Nova Scotia to Newfoundland to Scotland it will be another step in bring- 
ing the New World and the Old together. In terms of time New York and 
London will be a mere 4/100ths of a second apart. 

Plans call for two cables laid about ten miles apart and able to carry as 
many as 36 separate conversations simultaneously. Yet the cable itself will 
be no thicker than an ordinary lead pencil. 

Three miles down on the ocean floor the cable will be impervious to 
the atmospheric conditions that now wreak havoc with radiotelephonic 
communication. Jamming will be impossible, and the danger of having 
enemy agents hear secret messages will also be obviated. Since the exact 
location of the cable will be a security secret, tapping the line or cutting it 
will scarcely be possible without detection. 

Our citation of the month goes to the combined international effort 
that has made this 100 year old dream possible; and to the American 
Telephone and Telegraph Co., the British Post Office, and the Canadian 
Overseas Telecommunication Corporation who have combined their skill 
and resources for this project.

An IF Fact Article 

By M. T. Kay 


WO CONTRACTORS were in 
something of a dilemma. A 
spanking new house they had put 
up had sprung a leak — not a simple 
roof leak but a hidden one in the 
heating system buried in the con- 
crete floor. Somewhere in the maze 
of pipes, buried in tons of rock-hard 
concrete, the boiler was losing a gal- 
lon of hot water every ten minutes. 

“I can’t understand it,” one of 
the contractors said. “We tested 
that whole system before the ce- 
ment was poured.” 

The other viewed the situation 
hopelessly. “Well, that’s where it is. 
So we just start riping up the tile. 
Maybe we can find a wet spot.” 
“And if you don’t?” 

“Then we’ll just have to rip the 

whole floor out!” 

Ripping up the thick concrete 
floor would have added thousands 
to the cost, which would have been 


out of their own pockets, and the 
owner would have been delayed an- 
other month or so before he could 
move in. But, fortunately. That 
wasn’t the way the contractors had 
to solve their problem. Before the 
wrecking crew arrived, their prob- 
lem became known to a firm of 
nuclear engineers who recom- 
mended the use of radioactive iso- 
topes in pin-pointing the leak. 

The nuclear engineers put a small 
amount of the radioactive substance 
in the water of the heating system. 
Then it was circulated through the 
piping in the cement. A geiger 
counter would have gone crazy in 
that house. After a few minutes, the 
system was drained and the piping 
flushed. Now a geiger counter 
found only one hot spot, the con- 
crete at the point where the water 
was seeping into the cement. 

Only a couple feet of concrete 



117 



had to be chipped out. Without the 
use of this isotope hundreds of feet 
of flooring might have been ruined 
before the leak had been found. 
The owners moved in on time and 
the contractors saved a lot of 
money. 

The atomic age is here. Big job 
or little job, in every phase of life, 
it’s helping everybody toward an 
easier existence. Even the “con” 
man has entered the field. Reports 
are already coming in of sharp 
operators taking advantage of the 
public’s gullibility to pass off photo- 
graphic film as a detector for Ura- 
nium prospecting. 

Our new atomic age started when 
a small group of men tried to iden- 
tify the atoms, the building blocks 
of nature. They found oxygen, ni- 
trogen, silicon, chlorine and the 
other elements. Then they started 
putting them back together to give 
us textiles, cleaning compounds and 
new foods. From the ninety- three 
basic elements they have built over 
a half a million different com- 
pounds. 

Science was coming to a stand- 
still when Becquerel discovered 
radioactivity and called the rays 
that were coming out of the atoms 
“Becquerel Rays”. Later, when 
Rutherford found that there were 
three kinds of rays in the “Becque- 
rel Rays”, his assistant suggested 
calling them the “A, B, and G 
Rays”. 

“What?” Rutherford snorted. 
“Are you illiterate? We’ll call the 
‘Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Rays’ ”. 
And so the Greek curtain was 
pulled down over radioactivity. 

You understand why, of course. 
Anything new has to be made mys- 


terious. If it isn’t, people won’t ap- 
preciate your discovery. 

There was power in those radio- 
active materials. Those early experi- 
menters could feel it. Radioactive 
materials were warm to the touch. 
Immediately, they envisioned it as 
a fuel and tried to speed up the re- 
action. They heated it, cooled it, 
chopped it up, tried catalysts, but 
none of their chemical tricks 
worked. Nature went along in her 
own unhurried way; man just 
couldn’t push her. 

Then they began to realize that 
there were different kinds of atoms 
in the elements. There was a radio- 
active carbon atom and a stable 
type. The atoms that were radio- 
active were changing into atoms of 
a different element. Man tried his 
hand at duplicating nature’s feat 
and built expensive machines to 
transmute the elements. Before 
1940, though, you could put all the 
atoms man had changed into a 
thimble, and all the entries in the 
economic ledger were red. 

The discovery of the chain reac- 
tion brought the reactor into being. 
High density neutron beams in the 
reactor were more powerful than 
anything man or nature could make 
— and the race to make new atoms 
was on. 

Nowadays you can get just about 
any of the known atoms you want. 
In most cases, they are not exor- 
bitantly expensive. Standard sam- 
ples can be had for experimental 
purposes for a reasonable price. 

But there are still more kinds of 
atoms that are needed. We need a 
good radioactive oxygen atom. It 
would help biologists trace the path 
of water and carbon dioxide

through the plants. The plants can 
make sugar out of water, sunlight, 
and carbon dioxide. Man would 
like to know how they do it. If we 
knew we would not be dependant 
on nature for all our food. From 
the sugar you can make alcohol too, 
and then you wouldn’t have to 
worry about the oil fields running 
dry either. 

Making sugar isn’t the only 
dream the scientists have. They 
want to know how our bodies put 
sulphur, phosphor, calcium, and 
iron together to make living cells. 
This could mean new legs for the 
cripple, new eyes for the blind, new 
ears for the deaf, new teeth for the 
toothless. Most of the lower forms 
of life can rebuild lost and damaged 
parts of their bodies. Somehow, for 
higher forms of life, this was lost 
in evolution. If enough is known 
about how our bodies live, some 
genius may come along to find out 
how to restore this miracle to us. 


I MPOSSIBLE? No. If you de- 
mand it from science, you will 
get it. Our grandfathers demanded 
faster ships and we got our ocean 
liners. They demanded greater 
longevity and we got that too. In 
Caesar’s day, a man of thirty was 
old. Now a man of thirty is just 
getting started. You demand it — 
science will give it to you. 

It takes a genius to make sugar 
or to discover a way to help our 
bodies grow new limbs, but the 
ordinary man can use these tools 
too. 

For many years men have , been 
stationed in the mountains to meas- 
ure the depths of the snowbanks. 

TODAY AND ATOMICS 


This information is needed. If the 
snowfall is light, the dams have to 
hold all the water that comes down 
in the spring for next summer’s 
crops. If the snowfall is heavy, the 
water level in the dams most be 
lowered to provide the capacity 
necessary for controlling the spring 
floods. 

These men were lost to us for 
the most part of a year. They could 
have been employed in industry, 
building cars, houses, appliances, 
etc. Now the atomic age has re- 
leased these men. Instead of man 
power, a new machine measures the 
snowfall in the mountains. It has 
a small piece of radioactive cobalt 
buried in the ground and a counter 
hangs in the air over it. The radia- 
tion detected by the counter is 
proportional to the amount of ice 
and snow between it and the cobalt. 
The reading of the counter is re- 
layed by radio to civilization. 

Each new machine of the atomic 
age can be evaluated by estimating 
the number of man-hours saved or 
by the reduction in price of a 
product. If it does one of these two 
things, our standard of living goes 
up. 

A new drug is being prepared for 
the market. How good is it? How 
fast does your body absorb it? How 
much is used? How much lost? 

Radioactive tracers give the 
manufacturer the answer. The orig- 
inal drug may have been a calcate 
in the laboratory, but the atomic 
age tells the maker to use the sul- 
phite form. The result is a better 
product for you. 

A large chemical plant may be 
making dyes, and successfully too. 
Their product is selling. The plant

is operating five days a week. But 
are they as economical as they really 
can be? Are they working depleted 
chemicals too long? Should the re- 
action be kept at 150°F or at 
162°F? Radioactive tracers can 

f ive the management the answer. 

‘art of the savings in cost can 
go into higher wages for the work- 
ers. This is the kind of wage in- 
crease that does not lead to infla- 
tion. 

These things, more than the atom 
bomb, will affect your life in the 
years to come. They have already 
made their influence felt. It may 
be a while before we get back the 
billions of dollars that have been 
poured into the program, but the 
dividends are trickling in. 

Don’t say, “I’m a salesman, this 
isn’t going to affect me.” Four years 


ago that man in the mountains who 
measured snowdrifts probably felt 
that he was the last person the 
atomic age would reach. All of us 
are being nudged and pushed by 
the new era. Sometimes you can 
trip over a pot of gold, as was the 
case in electroplating companies 
who found that the water in their 
vats became rich in heavy hydro- 
gen, and heavy hydrogen brings a 
good price these days. 

You might lose your job in the 
new times at hand. Impersonal peo- 
ple call this “economic adjustment”. 
In this case you’ve just stubbed 
your toe. But whether you’re pick- 
ing up the gold or nursing a sore 
toe, you can look to a different and 
better life in the atomic future.

cally!) are unlawful. It’s called World Without War . Plus '

SAMPLING ORE — These two explorers are extracting ore samples from 
rock using an intense heat, the flame being similar to that of an acetylene 
torch. Many of the Moon's minerals are expected to be akin to those of 
Earth, but scientists anticipate some of which we have never heard. All 
samples dug up, or burned out, will be taken to the laboratory in the 
reconnaissance ship to be analysed and studied before any attempt is made 
to mine them on a large scale.
