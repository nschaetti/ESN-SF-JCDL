THE DAY 
THEY THREW 
GOD AT ME 


T here I sat, as the ancient saying 
goes, with my teeth in my mouth 
and my bare face hanging out. 
Clamped to my head was a tele- 
phone operator's transceiver; before 
me was a iarge microphone; at my 
left was Hizzoner the Editor, F. 
Pohl, Esq., similarly caparisoned; 
and across from us sat a personable 
man hight Ed Joyce, who runs this 
predicament weekdays on CBS Ra- 
dio. The transceivers shrilled in our 


ears at intervals, and from Out 
There in Radioland people threw 
questions by telephone. It is a great 
sport for those among you who would 
like to know what a live decoy feels 
like when he recognizes, among the 
bulrushes, a shooter of sitting ducks. 
Actually, this fear wasn't realized 
that day, and we had some interest- 
ing questions and a pleasant time of 
it; but one question does, I think, 
deserve a little space here.

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally to\& — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

Fred had been describing the re- 
cent work on DNA, and the creation 
©f life in the laboratory. “Don’t you 
think,” demanded the disembodied 
voice from Out There in Etc., “that 
to create life in the laboratory is to 
usurp God?” 

Answer: No. Man’s hands are 
God’s work; the work of man’s 
hands is God’s work. (I spoke 
— and speak — for myself, of course.) 
So much for the question and the 
questioner, but I’m glad he brought 
it up and equally glad to do like- 
wise here. 

The recurring suggestion that 
there’s some sort of Armageddon 
going on between Science and Reli- 
gion is, I think, a straw man for 
bigots. That Science has at one time 
or another dealt certain kinds of 
Religion a heavy blow, I do not ar- 
gue. I do believe, however, that what 
received the blow was this or that set 
of fixed convictions, and not Re- 
ligion itself. And I think that the 
idea that Science and Religion must 
of necessity be opposed to one an- 
other is a throwback at least to the 
19th Century — perhaps farther — and 
that to engage in this battle any 
more is equivalent to, and as quaint 
as, re-fighting the War of the Roses. 

It seems to me that this Arma- 
geddon notion springs from a con- 
cept which is more than a little in- 
sulting to both camps. Reduced to its 
simplest terms, it reads: Knowledge 
is Finite. The rationale would seem 
to be this: that jnly God can know 
everything and do everything. That 
the more man knows, the closer he 
gets to knowing It all, the more his 
science does, the closer it gets to 
doing it all; and that the end 
product v/ould be an omniscient 


and omnipotent man who would 
usurp the place of an omniscient and 
omnipotent God. 

Now, if science proves anything at 
all, it is that both knowledge and 
power potentials are infinite. The 
ultimate in either can never be 
reached. For those who care to be- 
lieve it, God already has this knowl- 
edge and potency. How then could 
there possibly be a conflict in the 
matter? 

Furthermore, science has demon- 
strated time and again, and will 
always demonstrate, that the pro- 
duction of solutions is the richest 
source of new problems. This too 
seems to be an infinite process. As 
the size of our body of knowledge 
grows, so does the size of the as-yet- 
unknown. And ever shall. Many 
churchmen can take this calmly in 
stride, regarding it (in which I 
concur) as a living manifestation of 
the greatness of this infinite Cause. 

I know personally a good many 
scientists Being people, they pre- 
sent a cross-section of convictions 
and attitudes quite as varied as those 
of any people. In the area of reli- 
gion, I have met scientists far more 
devout than I could ever want to be; 
I’ve met unmoved, habitual, Sunday- 
best churchgoers, backslid Ortho- 
doxers; agnostics, atheists and peo^ 
pi* who just don’t care one way or 
another. 

There is no secret sect of 
guys with test-tubes out to destroy 
the temples. There are more anti-re- 
ligionists outside Science than in 
it . and if God thinks about this 
at all, He probably feels that He 
made a cosmos quite roomy enough 
to contain them all.

THREE WORLDS TO CONQUER 



IF • Short Story 


MACK 


BY R. J. BUTLER 

ILLUSTRATED BY MORROW 

Against the invaders from 
space man had a secret ally 
— from the ocean’s depths! 


M ack maintained later he had 
merely assessed the situation 
and acted accordingly — something 
any dolphin could have done. 

The Admiral was just plain im- 
pressed — and proved it — and, for 
his part, Gabriel Anaka was over- 
whelmingly satisfied in having proved 
one point. 

The only ones who had no com- 
ment at all were the Tegels and the 
manta ray. 

First, there had been the spotting 
of the Tegel ship, a feat made easier 
(if not pleasanter) by its monstrous 
size. 

While the earth fleet circled it 
warily, the best minds available were 


put to work in an effort to establish 
communications and find out what 
the intentions were. 

The Tegels obliged, in their own 
time, and when the response to the 
beamed math-logic was received, the 
message didn’t take long to decipher. 

It said in effect: “Your oceans in- 
teresting. Investigating.” The signa- 
ture symbols were roughly equival- 
ent to “Tegels.” 

While military minds pondered 
what was meant by “investigating,” 
the Tegels provided the answer. They 
plopped down into the Gulf of Mex- 
ico a few miles off the Alabama 
coast 

“Starship Falls Off Alabama,”

one responsible southern daily in- 
formed its readers. The Admiral, 
with considerably less humor, dis- 
patched a submarine to the scene. 

This move resulted in a long si- 
lence followed by a curt communi- 
cation requesting “the absence of 
disturbances in our vicinity.” 

There was no overt threat, but, 
as the Admiral pointed out, there 
was something ominous about the 
way “our” was used. 

Afro-Asian Commander Hoghen- 
za recommended treaty talks. 

Soviet Commander Tushkin urged 
immediate attack. 

Indian Commander Bihar advo- 
cated neutrality for the Gulf of 
Mexico. 

The Admiral went in circles with 
them. 

Finally he got them to agree — to 
investigate. 

And the best way to investigate, 
the Admiral concluded, was with 
Mack and Anaka. It was a conclusion 
arrived at with more than a few res- 
ervations. 

Mack was one of the ablest dol- 
phins serving with Earth Fleet, but, 
to the Admiral’s way of thinking, the 
eight-foot cetacean was a little too 
“unmilitary” in his attitude. 

Too independent, bluntly. 

He thought the same of Anaka, 
but there was no way of getting 
around it. A man-dolphin team was 
the best way to keep tabs on the Te- 
gels, and Mack and the tall Poly- 
nesian had demonstrated their ability 
to get along. 

Demonstrated it too well in some 
cases, the Admiral thought. 

Item: On Venus, Anaka and Mack 


arrested on charge of trying to pro- 
cure a gilled Venusian for immoral 
purposes. Case dismissed — but wide- 
ly reported — after Mack argued it 
would have been impossible for eith- 
er of them to be immoral with a 
lizard even if they had been sober. 

Item: Off Ganymede, Anaka and 
Mack demoted for polluting hydro- 
ponics tank in experiment to ferment 
algae alcohol. 

And so on. 

The Admiral sighed and- sum- 
moned the two to Fleet Headquar- 
ters. 

Anaka stood stiffly at attention, 
eyes fixed on a crack in the wall. 

“Furthermore,” the Admiral con- 
tinued sternly, “I want to impress on 
you the fact that the Tegels may be 
technologically equal — or even su- 
perior — to us.” 

“Yes, Admiral.” 

The Admiral picked up a model 
space cruiser and eyed it thought- 
fully. 

“As for you, Mack,” he said, turn- 
ing toward the circular tank, “I don’t 
think I need stress the importance 
of discipline in this matter.” 

“Admiral . right. Not . need- 
ing . stress . point.” The words 
came booming out of the ampli- 
fying unit surgically implanted by 
Mack’s “mouth” — the blowhole on 
top of his head. 

The Admiral’s face turned red. 
He considered a lecture on what 
could happen — what might happen — 
if the Tegels turned out to be both 
militarily able and hostile at the 
same time. 

But he .changed his mind and 
stalked out of the room.

The last thing he saw before he 
slammed the door was Anaka look- 
ing at Mack in admiration as the 
dolphin did a neat figure-eight on 
his back. 

4 4 X) oss ibly • • • dull . as . mul- 

1 let . head,” Mack comment- 
ed later as he towed Anaka around 
the Tegel ship in a wide circle for 
the fiftieth time. 

“Yeah,” Anaka agreed disgusted- 
ly, hitting the stud to the small out- 
side mask speaker with his chin. 

He loosened his grip on the plas- 
tic reins trailing from the halter 
around the dolphin’s body. 

“Guess I’d better file a report.” 
It was understood Mack wouldn’t 
have to do it unless an emergency 
came up. It took him too long to 
form the difficult human words by 
vibrating the blowhole which served 
as his nostril. 

Anaka kicked his feet and headed 
for the surface, where the buoy with 
the tele-beam bobbed monotonously. 

The Admiral had demanded com- 
plete, concise reports. Anaka com- 
plied. 

“No activity around the ship,” 
he advised. “And no sign of a Tegel 
yet.” 

He signed off and went under 
again. When he reached the big dol- 
phin, he hit him on the head play- 
fully with a meaty fist. 

“Chow?” 

“Thinking . good . splendid 
. damfine . ideas.” 

Anaka pulled a tube of “frogman’s 
crud” from his belt and sucked on 
the tasteless combination of mushy 
fruit and protein. 


“You . enjoy?” 

“Sure.” 

“Then . hoping . swallow 
. whole . thing,” Mack rum- 
bled, thwacking Anaka on the back 
cheerfully with his tail. Anaka 
choked, messing up the inside of his 
mask. 

“Overgrown sardine!” he shouted. 

Mack whistled a dolphin laugh and 
swam for shallower waters, where 
he overtook a school of speckled 
trout. He managed to gulp down 
three small ones before the rest of 
the school escaped. 

Anaka flipped off the glaring 
Hensen light and finished his meal 
in darkness, mulling over things to 
do to Mack. 

4400,” First Garn bubbled happi- 

^ ly, “this is found in plenti- 
tudes?” 

With two tentacles he brought 
to his mouth the delightful new food 
creature they had discovered. He took 
a small bite, munching in pleasure. 

“There is much of it,” Second 
Garn affirmed, watching the small 
spade fish disappear. 

“Such an offering,” First Garn 
gurgled piously, “calls for gratitude.” 
His small red eyes glowed meaning- 
fully. 

“Indeed,” Second Garn said, 
bringing out the metal-leatf Dutiful. 

He handed it to First Garn, as 
was proper, and First Garn began 
the intonation: 

“Prime Garn, power; Prime Garn, 
obedience; Prime Garn, laws . ” 

The Tegel crew extended its myr- 
iad listening tentacles in obedient 
reverence. 


62 


IF 



When it was over, the Tegel ship 
opened its suction locks to bring 
in more food samples to see if this 
new planet was worth while. It wasn’t 
really necessary, however. 

First Garn had already decided. 

T he manta ray was big. It also was 
irritable. 

The irritation started with 'the 
churning motor of the fourteen-foot 
boat. 

And it reached its peak when the 
three men aboard started casting 
alongside the bat-like ray for the 
lemon fish that swam under it, feed- 
ing on offal. 

The ray went down in a power- 
dive. When it came up, the boat 
made another run on it for more 
casting. 

With an angry flip, the three thou- 
sand pound ray hurled itself over the 
boat. One man screamed and went 
over the side. 

The other two ducked and closed 
their eyes. 

Mack heard the distant crack as 
the ray hit the water, and, seconds 
later, pinpointed it with his natural 
sonar. 

“Unholy . king . mackerel!” 
“Huh? What in hell?” Anaka had 
been catching a nap, strapped to 
Mack’s back with the reins. 

“Ray.” 

“So what? There’s lots of rays 
around here.” The Polynesian un- 
strapped himself. 

“Lots . maybe,” Mack thun- 
dered, pointing his beak toward the 
Tegel ship, “but . not . going 
• • . that . direction!” 

-Uh, oh!" Anaka had caught the 


ray in the Hensen light. “That’s the 
biggest one I ever saw.” 

“Maybe . trouble.” 

Anaka thought a moment. “If it 
kicks up any fuss around their 
ship, no telling how they’ll react.” 

“Good . idea . getting . 
you . better . position ... if 
. need . call . help.” Mack 
swished his tail for emphasis. 

“Okay. I’m going up a hundred 
feet.” 

“Going . further!” The Tegel 
ship was in fairly shallow water — 
about three hundred feet — but Mack 
knew any violence in the water could 
rip Anaka’s skin-thin pressure suit. 

Anaka knew it, too, but he didn’t 
like the idea of leaving Mack alone. 

“Listen, dammit, you aren’t giving 
me orders!” 

“Not . arguing . now!” 
Mack got under Anaka and pushed 
him up. 

By the time Anaka could make 
out the buoy by natural light, he 
was grinning behind his mask. Mack 
always looked after him. 

“Be careful, Daddy!” 

“Suggest . you . idiot!” Mack 
prodded Anaka in the rear with 
his beak and swam back down alone. 

F irst Garn wiggled his tentacles 
exuberantly. Second Garn turn- 
ed brown in vicarious pleasure. 

“There is,” First Garn said, “ab- 
solutely no reason why we should 
not clear the way for colonization. 
No reason whatsoever.” 

He took another bite out of the 
small white trout. 

“In fact,” he continued, “Tokh 
himself could not dissuade me from 


MACK 


43 



taking over these splendid feeding 
grounds now.” 

He tossed the remnants of the 
fish to Second Garn, who turned 
orange in appreciation. 

First Garn turned to take another 
sample from the specimen container. 

“ Alarm, First Garn!” the watch 
crew signaled in unison before he 
could grab another small fish. 

“Alarm? Specify the nature.” 

“It is a monster, First Garn,” the 
watch crew replied. “It is coming 
toward our vessel!” 

First Garn swam to the observa- 
tion scope and activated a scan 
beam. It took only a second to lock in 
on the approaching ray. 

“By Tokh, it is a monster!” 

Second Garn sneaked a glimpse 
and turned purple in apprehension. 

“Prepare to blast!” First Garn or- 
dered. 

All three hundred of the blast 
crew readied the weapon. 

“Destroy!” 

The ray shuddered as the electron 
pellet struck, sending pain surging 
down every nerve path. Tail lashing 
in agony, it moved closer to the 
Tegel ship. 

First Garn turned blue. “Use pri- 
mary weapon!” 

A thousand tentacles worked the 
fire-control panel. A slim projec- 
tile streaked toward the ray. 

■ 

M ack rolled over when the shock 
waive hit him. After he re- 
gained his even keel, he quickly 
probed the water with his sonar. He 
spotted only pieces of the big ray. 

Mack turned away from the Tegel 
ship and sped up to Anaka. 


The Polynesian had been fa. 
enough from the explosion to avoid 
injury, but was waving his arms 
frantically as Mack approached. 

“Hell, I didn’t catch any of it. 
What happened?” 

“Tegels . destroy . ray.” 
“They spot you?” 

“Don’t . think. Being . still 
• . and . not . too . near. 
“What kind of weapons?” 
“Unknowing . first . tried . 
. but . didn’t . seem ,. ad- 
vanced.” 

“And?” 

“Second . probably . high . 
explosives.” 

“High explosives?” There was a 
trace of incredulity in Anaka’s voice. 
“With a ship like that, you’d think 
they’d have some fission stuff.” 
“Possible . probable . but . 
only . damfool . use . fis- 
sion . in . water . close . 
range.” 

“That figures. We better get to 
base personally with this.” He grab- 
bed the halter and let the reins out. 

Mack was thinking all the way 
back. 

4 4 A Tot only is it stupid,” the Ad- 
-L 'N miral barked, “it’s also sui- 
cidal — for us.” 

Anaka, not wholly convinced the 
Admiral was wrong, kept his silence. 

Mack didn’t. It seemed perfectly 
logical to him. 

“Urge . reconsider . Admiral. 
Hard . for . me . express . 
your . language . but . pos- 
itive . will . work. 

“You have no guarantee, dammit 
And we can’t take chances!” 


64 


IF 



“Suggest . Admiral . knows 
. less . these . matters • • • 
than . dolphin.” 

The storm signals were evident on 
the Admiral’s face. 

“Don’t be insubordinate, Mack,” 
the Admiral growled. 

“Will . leave . then.” 

Mack had him dead to rights. Al- 
though the dolphins were nominally 
under Fleet advisories, the Treaty of 
1998 gave them absolute freedom 
from human interference. Their ser- 
vice was voluntary. 

The Admiral glared down at Mack 
in the tank. “Get the hell out, in 
that case. No one’s stopping you.” 
Mack didn’t reply. He glanced at 
Anaka once, then swam through 
the tank tunnel into the open sea. 

The Admiral turned to Anaka. 
“You think he was right?” 

“Well, I just don’t know, sir.” 

“As long as you have any doubt 
about it,” the Admiral snapped, 
“you’re confined to quarters.” 

F irst Gam considered the ray’s 
destruction proof that any dan- 
gerous life forms could be handled. 

“And isn’t it true,” he asked Sec- 
ond Garn, “that we have seen no 
other threatening forms?” 

“Yes, First Garn.” 

“And that we have seen no in- 
telligent opposition f to our rightful 
presence here?” 

“Yes, First Garn.” 

“Then we may assume that the 
intelligent life forms are inferior and 
fear us. Prepare the summons.” 
Broken down to its simplest se- 
mantic elements, the summons said: 
“Food good. Come.” 


M ack took the lead and, in age-' 
old respect for the joy of life 
and its expression in graceful swim* 
ming, slapped the water hard with- 
his tail every minute. 

The others waited patiently, and 
finally Mack spoke in the rapid 
whistling, clicking, grunting dolphin 
language. 

“I think we are obligated to act 
for* them.” 

“That might be,” the dolphin be- 
hind him said, “but can you offer a 
truly valid reason?” 

“They are our friends.” 

“You have told us of this Ad- 
miral.” 

“But he is at a disadvantage. He 
does not understand the ways of the 
waters.” 

“And you think these Tegels can 
be regarded in that light?” 

“There is every reason to believe 
so.” 

“We will get no thanks for it, in 
all probability.” 

“We have had our thanks.” The 
meaning was clear, and several of 
the dolphins further back whistled 
their agreement. 

“Think,” Mack said, “of all they 
gave us. A symbolic language. The 
ability to develop our own culture. 
Even a chance to explore space with 
them.” 

The dolphin behind Mack could 
not argue. 

Before Homo sapiens discovered 
that dolphins had brains as fully de- 
veloped as man’s, the dolphins were 
an intelligent, but cultureless, species. 
They played, fed and bred with only 
a primitive language of a few basic 
meanings. Man had made something

more of them, and Mack wanted a 
chance to prove it. 

“Will you follow me?” he asked. 

“Yes,” the dolphin behind him 
•aid. 

Mack listened. 

“Yes,” the others whistled. 

Mack led the way. 

naka had disobeyed orders. 
Being confined to quarters had 
been bad enough, but the Admiral’s 
indignation had increased instead of 
mellowing. 

He had told Anaka he wouldn’t 
be working with dolphins any more 
— Mack or any others. 

Anaka thought about it for a while 
in his room. 

“The hell with it,” he said. He 
put on his pressure suit and walked 
to the beach. 

The water felt good as it covered 
him. Almost like his natural element. 

Mack picked the Polynesian up on 
his sonar about a mile from the Tegel 
ship. 

“What . doing . here?” he 
asked, nuzzling Anaka’s mask gently. 

“Coming to watch after you, stu- 
pid.” Anaka felt a little like crying. 

“Suggesting . trouble . with 
. Admiral?” 

“A little.” Anaka tried to sound 
casual. 

“We . f ix . that . trouble,” 
Mack predicted. 

Anaka felt suspicion forming in 
the back of his mind. 

“How’s that?” 

“You . watch.” 

Anaka swung the Hensen light 
around. He picked out two dolphins 
coming in. Then more. And more. 


“What in hell?” 

Mack whistled rapidly, and the 
dolphins formed a long line behind 
him. 

“Oh, no!” Anaka moaned as it 
dawned on him. “You can’t be seri- 
ous.” 

“Very . serious.” 

“They’ll make mincemeat out of 
you, Mack. You dolphins have no 
weapons!” 

“We . thinking . Tegels . 
stupid,” Mack asserted affably. 

“Stupid enough for spaceflight?” 

“Special . kind . stupid.” 

“I can’t talk you out of it?” 

“No.” 

“In that case,” Anaka said firmly, 
“I might as well watch the slaughter. 
And you’re not going to talk me out 
of it.” He took the underwater rock- 
et-gun from its sheath. 

Mack gave the equivalent of a 
shrug with his tail and let Anaka 
hang on to his back. 

F irst Garn floated complacently 
as the technical crew pre- 
pared to send the rocket bobbing to 
the surface, from whence it would 
blast into orbit and transmit. 

“This is a moment of historic 
note,” he told Second Garn, who 
turned a deep crimson in agreement. 

“Soon,” First Garn predicted, “all 
of our people will offer us thanks.” 
He waved his tentacles majestic- 
ally. 

“Let the rocket go!” 

He followed it with a scan beam. 
It rose almost two hundred feet be- 
fore an alert dolphin saw it, butted it 
to the bottom, hammered it into 
the mud and “sat” on it

“Prepare all weapons!” First Garn 
raged. 

Mack whistled urgently. The dol- 
phins withdrew rapidly and set up 
a cross-pattern of false sonar echoes. 

“Destroy!” First Garn screamed. 
The electron pellets and projectiles 
went off on a wild tack, misled by 
th. fake sonar. 

“Out of ship for attack!” First 
Garn screeched. The Tegels swam 
out after the dolphins, pulling porta- 
ble assault weapons. 

Mack led the dolphins toward the 
Tegels. 

“Bring weapons to bear!” First 
Gam felt victory nearing. At close 
range, it could not be otherwise. 

The thousand-tenacled fire-control 
team brought the weapons to bear, 
carefully and accurately as the dol- 
phins slowly came closer. 

So carefully was it done that by 
the time they were ready Mack had 
led the dolphins in a burst of speed 
behind them. 

“We have been outwitted!” First 
Garn shrieked. Several hundred Te- 
gels swung around, noted First Garn 
was correct and awaited his com- 
mand. 

It never came. 

Mack swallowed him with ease, 
and split seconds later the other 
dolphins were similarly occupied. 

Anaka remembered later, with 
some regret, that he had not fired 
a single shot. 

44Tn that case,” the Admiral 

A laughed, slapping Anaka on 
the back, “I guess we’ll have to 
credit the dolphins with the whole 
thing.” 


“Yes, sir.” 

The Admiral squatted down by the 
tank. 

“Mack, I disagreed with you when 
you told me what you wanted to do. 
I still think the risk was too great 
and, by all rights, both of you should 
be busted again.” 

He paused smilingly. “That is if 
you’ll let yourself be busted volun- 
tarily — again.” 

“Think . dolphins,” Mack said 
from the tank, “still . know . 
more . those . things ...” 

The Admiral looked at Mack af- 
fectionately “Let me in on it?” 

Mack spouted a tall column of 
water, taking a deep breath. 

“Had . hunch ... Tegels . 
have . fish . way . thinking.” 

“Huh? Anaka beat the Admiral 
to the punch. 

“Had . feeling . would . 

. follow . leader . blindly.” 

“But, dammit,” the Admiral broke 
in, “they were capable of space 
flight, so they must have been smart- 
er than fish.” 

“Smart . some . ways . 
stupid . others.” 

“I think I get a part of it, Admir- 
al,” Anaka offered “He’s trying 
tell us they had a blind spot in their 
behavior — so far as the dolphins 
were concerned. In other words, 
without leadership they were abso- 
lutely helpless, incapable of inde- 
pendent action.” 

The Admiral frowned. “How in 
hell could you count on getting them 
outside?” 

“Was . thinking . if . made 
. mad . enough . would . 
come . after . us.”

•‘You didn’t know that for sure, 
though,” Anaka insisted. 

“No . but . knew . if . 
like . fish . in . thought . 
might . attack . in . group 
. like ...” 

“Like a school of fish?” The Ad- 
miral’s mouth was open. 

“Hoped . so.” 

Anaka put his hand on the dol- 
phin’s head. “Were you sure you 
could foul up their weapons effec- 
tively?” 

“Not . ..sure . anything. Had 
. good . hunch . and . 
felt . our . duty.” 

“Well, I’ll be damned,” the Ad- 
miral said reverently. 

“Probably,” Anaka agreed. The 
Admiral didn’t even hear him. He 
was thinking of another assignment 
for Mack and Anaka. 

T he President, reading from the 
official report, told the cheer- 
ing crowds the dolphins took the 
chance because they felt they had 
better odds underwater than might 
have been had in an open space bat- 
tle with the Tegels. 

And, he added somberly, teams 
going over the Tegel ship had indeed 
proved they were right. 


There was silence when he in- 
formed them of the summons that 
had been recovered and translated. 

Mack was not listening. He was 
tired from the lengthy questioning of 
the last few days. And he was think- 
ing of a smaller, slimmer dolphin 
he had not seen for a long time. So 
he was reasonably surprised when 
Anaka, standing next to the Presi- 
dent grabbed him around the middle 
and half lifted him out of the tank. 

He was even more surprised when 
the President taped the medal to his 
broad flanks. 

But the real moment of pride 
came later when the new space cruis- 
er blasted out of its berth for its 
maiden trip Out. 

Mack was swimming in the spa- 
cious control tank — Captain Mack 
of The Dolphin . Anaka was there in 
the No. 2 spot, helping the crew get 
used to Mack. 

. It didn’t take long. ^ 

Before they passed the Martian 

orbit, they had dropped the formal 

“sir” and just called him Cap- 
tain Mack. 

% Mack liked it. So did the smaller 
dolphin who swam in the extra- 
large tank in Mack’s quarters. They 
called her Mrs. Mack. END

PERSONAL 

MONUMENTS 

BY THEODORE STURGEON 


F rom my throne here in the center 
of the universe, I took issue with 
a recent survey of science fiction, 
saying it was a pity not to have 
mentioned a certain half-dozen writ- 
ers who had influenced the field. A 
faint rumor is going around that 
these six don’t cut all that much 
ice, which is manifestly absurd — as 
much so as the implication that there 
are other universes besides the one 
which revolves about this chair. 

Seriously, we do indeed perform 
many or most of our own defini- 
tions, and for me, science fiction 
could hardly be what it is, and what 
it has been to me, without these six 
— in addition, of course, to the 
Hugo’s and Heinleins, the Startlings 
and Stapledons, and all the other 
fixed stars in the sf firmament. These 
six were mentioned, not because of 
literary gigantism, not because you 
and you should burn offerings before 
their ikons, but only because sf 


could not be what it is to me without 
them. As you’ll see, their status in 
my cosmos is personal and/or pro- 
fessional. I stress again that I trou- 
ble to mention because they have 
been structural in my sf — not ne- 
cessarily yours. 

A. J. Budrys : In his very early 
twenties, Burdys produced a number 
of short stories each of which con- 
cerned, to greater, or less degree, old 
people. I freely confess that I don’t 
know as much about anything as he 
did about old people — the wistful- 
ness, the scar-tissue, the compacted 
conservatism — and the distilled 
knowledge that only a life-time of 
living can endow. There is at times 
an unleavened quality about his writ- 
ing, which may be, for all I know, 
only consistent with this phenome- 
nal percocity; for all that, it is my 
considered opinion that Budrys, 
should he care to travel that road, 
has the material in him for lasting 
greatness. 


69 


Nevil Shute : Not only a perfect 
Journeyman nuts-and-bolts writer — 
one who does his homework and uses 
all his tools — Shute is to me the 
most perfect example of the general 
public’s blind-spot concerning sf. If 
many sf writers have slightly para- 
noid feelings, it’s because a reader- 
ship which can readily discriminate 
between Shane and Hopalong Cassi- 
dy , between Graham Greene and 
Mickey Spillane, doesn’t and won’t 
learn the difference between the top 
ranks of sf and the funny papers. If 
On the Beach had been written by 
Edgar Pangborn (but then he 
wouldn’t; and if he did, he might not 
have been able to sell it to any maga- 
zine in the field) no one would have 
heard of it. If Shute had written A 
Mirror for Observers (but then he 
couldn’t) it would have been made 
into a Class A movie. In other 
words, any mainstream writer can 
get away with mediocre sf. Great sf 
tends to stay right in the clubhouse, 
even when it outranks its. contem- 
poraries in every other field. Why, 
most of the people who buy this 
kind of thing don’t even know 
they’re reading science fiction; Fail 
Safe is a sf novel; so is 1984, and 
Seven Days in May, and Advise and 
Consent , and any other work which 
takes current knowledge and extra- 
polates it to probable or possible 
ends. (This, by the way, isn’t my 
definition of sf — just because it isn’t 
all that sf does.) 

Edgar Pangborn is, then, Shute’s 
mirror image in this matter. Go find 
A Mirror for Observers if you can 
and wonder with me how prose so 
polished, pacing so skilled, could with 


justice ever have been allowed to slip 
down the oubliette. 

William Tenn : It would be too 
wide a generalization to say that 
every sf satire, every sf comedy and 
every attempt at witty and biting crit- 
icism found in the field is a poor and 
usuually cheap imitation of what this 
man has been doing since the ’40s. 
In addition I owe him a great deal 
personally, for his incredibly involved 
and complex mind can at times pro- 
duce constructive comment so point- 
ed and astute that the fortunate re- 
cipient is permanently improved by 
it. Admittedly the price may be to 
create two whole categories for our 
species: humanity, and Wm. Tenn, 
for each of which you must create 
your ethos and your laws. I’ve done 
that. And to me it’s worth it. 

Vercors acquired this single name, 
if I remember correctly, in his days 
as a lethal journalist in the French 
Resistance. Most of his work re- 
flects an almost unique ability to 
drive to real basics and subject them 
to scrutiny and analysis. The one 
book which affected me the most, 
both for content and method, is You 
Shall Know Them. The simple nar- 
rative situation is the discovery of a 
species, deep in the Outback, which 
is either a superior ape or an inferior 
man. Which it is presents the prob- 
lem. Those who wish to train the 
creatures to work in mills and fac- 
tories say they’re animals. Those who 
feel otherwise set up a powerful 
. counterforce, most of the power be- 
ing in noise and indignation. The pro- 
tagonist decides to have the matter 
proved, and in his laboratory in Eng- 
land he personally impregnates one

of the females (let me add here that 
this simple fact, when gossiped 
around, horrified potential readers by 
the million, and probably cost the 
book its rightful place. Please tell your 
Aunt Amelia that the process was 
clinical, unromantic and performed 
with instruments) and when the off- 
spring was born, he killed it (pain- 
lessly, Aunty) and then phoned the 
police. Now if the creature was an 
animal, so what? But if it were hu- 
man, he was a murderer. Therefore: 
go to court. 

V ercors wrote this book around 
the (to me) shattering dis- 
covery that never in any literature, 
in all its history, has there been a 
true definition of Man. Descriptions, 
yes. Genuine definitions, no. He also 
pays the kind of tribute to the Eng- 
lish courts which Joseph Conrad 
paid the English language; both men 
had adequate knowledge and experi- 
ence to choose among many. He felt 
that the one place on earth where 
such a definition could be winnowed 
out was in an English Court of Law, 
and the bulk of the book is the trial 
transcript; and I’m not about to tell 
you how it comes out. What’s im- 
portant here is a matter of defin- 
ition too. 'Here’s a towering exam- 
ple of what sf is, can be and should 
be: an exploration of mores, atti- 
tudes and motivations, as well as 
science, clear down to bedrock so 
basic that it bears on every human 
being who ever drew breath. There 
are few expressions heard or read 
which have had such an impact on 
me; that I bewail the lack of a 
mention for this author is probably 


this difficulty I keep having that you 
think my universe isn’t the universe. 

Tom Godwin is a name which 
possibly won’t be found graven on 
granite three millennia from now; 
yet one story (of the many compe- 
tent ones he has written) was anoth- 
er personal blockbuster. The Cold 
Equations is an extremely simple 
statement of the fact that natural law 
is to be used, not broken. A scout 
ship on a mercy mission upon which 
several lives depend is found to have 
a stowaway. Due to the un-bend- 
able strictures of the situation, the 
stowaway must be thrown out or 
the ship will crash. Concededly, God- 
win makes the most of the situation 
by having the stowaway turn out to 
be a pretty girl in her teens; aside 
from that, there’s nothing in the 
story that isn’t straight, clear and 
uncompromising. The human equa- 
tion is of course agonizing, but in 
terms of the real problem it is 
meaningless. The solution to the 
problem is so clear there is no 
choice; so it isn’t at all a problem- 
and-answer story. It is that* great 
rarity, an unequivocating examina- 
tion of a real situation. The fact 
that such a situation has never ex- 
actly occurred is quite beside the 
point. And ever since I read that 
story, it has made itself a category 
and an aim. This too is what sf is 
for. 

I t might be interesting to see what 
other writers (and readers, too) 
have to say about their special per- 
sonal monuments — those which have 
been obscured by the public skyline.

IF • Novelette 




BY JACK B. LAWSON 

ILLUSTRATED BY NODEL 

He knew a robot was only a tool 
to be used by men • But the big 
question was — who was using who? 


I 

T he fast, silent way it crossed the 
room wasn’t just efficiency. It 
was an insult or, more likely, a 
challenge. As if crossing rooms with* 
out making a noise were some kind 
of game: Now you got a turn. 

Questions Controller Karl Paker, 
who by regulation had to rise and 
greet even robots a courteous three 
paces in front of his desk, remained 

74 


squarely behind it, thoroughly seated 
and — in his mind anyway — swollen 
with hate. His bones, God knew, 
made noises enough, what with the 
accumulated frictions of fifty-five 
too-busy years. More, he limped. He 
wasn’t going to give this thing a 
chance to listen and watch. 

The next instant he saw his mis- 
take. You have to move to stay 
ahead of robots. Ahead morally, that 
is; physically you can’t hope to as 

IP

much as stay even. This one took and 
turned Paker’s insult. Finding those 
last three steps open it took them, 
then seated itself on the corner of 
his desk. 

Paker couldn’t breathe. Something 
went wrong in his throat. Pushing 
back his chair a little and gripping 
the arms he regarded his visitor — to 
all outward appearance, a handsome, 
rather slender youth of about twenty, 
smooth-skinned and bright-eyed. 
You could tell it from the human 
only by its too-perfect humanity. 

In his mind Paker took the bottle 
of Earth cognac from the bottom 
left-hand drawer and, swinging from 
all the way back, christened that 
faintly rose right cheek good and 
gory. Or greasy, since that was the 
best it could do. But the very deli- 
cacy of its coloring somehow warned 
him that the three-hundred credit 
bottle, and not his visitor, would be 
the one to suffer; what he had to 
deal with wasn’t so much cheek as 
it was brass. He sank back and mere- 
ly glared at the drawer handle. 

“Well?” he said when his throat 
was working again. 

The robot gave him a youthful 
smile, though the thing was maybe 
three times his age 

“I am R 391,” it said. “However, 
you may call me Rob, or even Rob- 
by, if you have the appropriate per- 
sonality-index. I am a human factors 
coordinator for this region. You are 
the Questions Controller and I am 
here at your request.” 

“Yes,” said Paker, not looking 
up. “Wefl.” 

But he could face up to things, 
even things as humiliating as this. 


“Look here,” he started over, now 
meeting the robot’s eyes — or what- 
ever it wanted to call them. “We need 
help. I evaluate the questions. There 
seems to be only one of any 
promise, even if I don’t like it. So 
I’m asking: Are there conditions 
under which the robot kind would 
agree to help us?” 

As soon as he was done saying 
it he dropped his gaze back to the 
left bottom drawer. Cognac might 
not be a club, but it would make an 
awfully comfortable hole to hide in. 

A fter all, he’d gone into questions 
control work some twenty-seven 
years ago because it seemed the one 
area where human beings had it over 
robots — in fact, had to have it over 
robots to survive. 

Well, not survive, he thought. Ro- 
bots would look after humans to 
that extent. Otherwise, where was his 
purpose, But in the present furiously 
competitive expansion into space, the 
only edge robots didn’t have was in 
questions: Men could ask new ones, 
robots couldn’t. 

And when you got the questions, 
the best you could do was ask the 
robot for help. Oh, yes. He’d need 
a lot of cognac to hide the taste of 
that. 

“ ‘We’ means more humans than 
you,” observed R 391. 

“Me,” said Paker. “The three 
thousand human beings left in this 
region. And lots more, maybe even 
the thirty billion all over the galaxy. 
We’re in a real hole.” 

He waited, but it was silent. Dra- 
matic pauses never worked on ma- 
chines. “We’ve lost two planets.” He

IF 



rose, limped to the filing cabinet 
by the window. Let it see the limp. 
Here the thing wasn’t sitting on top 
of him anyhow. “I’ve got it all on 
tape for you, since that’s the quick- 
est way. But it might help if you 
heard it from a human too; tapes are 
computer-filtered. Out there around 
0C40, just seventeen light years and 
four months from where I’m stand- 
ing, there’s a nice Earth-type world, 
exactly the sort we’ve got to have if 
we’re going to prevent ...” He 
paused, blinked. 

“ — to prevent our taking over. 
Yes. Human policy is no secret.” 

It wasn’t. Or if it was a secret, it 
was an open one. If robots got the 
stars, as they were already getting 
two thirds of them, then you had no 
place to go. You would have to live 
in houses not out in the open, and 
when that happened you were lost. 
Robots were such damn good house- 
keepers. 

“Anyway, in due course we went 
down on the planet — Baggins’ world. 
Too fast, of course. There’s never 
enough time to prepare things right, 
if we’re going to stay ahead. And 
we couldn’t let your kind have that 
world. Why, a man could almost 
walk around there in the raw!” 

H e faced the robot, which was still 
perched on his desk as if that 
were the only comfortable seat in 
the room. “Planets that congenial 
aren’t easy to come by, you know. 
Trouble is, somebody else already 
lived there. An intelligent some- 
body.” 

Paker thrust out his hands — half 
fight, half appeal. 


"Maybe you can figure how we 
felt. There are lots of more or less 
intelligent animals in the universe, 
but until we got to Baggins’ world 
nothing in the human class. It was 
like when you’ve been on a scout 
ship for a very long time, just your- 
self all alone, and then you make 
planetfall and suddenly there are 
other people talking too. That’s how 
it’s been with the hiiman race, ex- 
cept for you greasers. Well, we could 
talk to Bagginses, or almost, though 
they didn’t seem quite right — ” 

“You mean they are not human.” 

“Maybe something like that. Only 
you’re not human too, and we can 
talk. What it was with the Bagginses, 
they didn’t seem to have any ambi- 
tion.” Paker considered briefly. “We 
went down. I should explain they’re 
underground, and they were willing 
enough to let us have the surface. 
Which we already had, for that mat- 
ter. Anyway, there don’t seem to be 
many of them, they’re only under 
this small part of one continent. No 
ambition, like I said. Not quite right. 

“Well, that ‘not quite right* turned 
out to be plenty wrong. One of our 
teams located a fantastic vein of ra- 
dioactives and sank a mine. It’s not 
often you can mine radioactives in 
a habitable system. Well, I guess you 
could say mining in that spot was 
out by the treaty, but it was inevi- 
table. They ought to have seen that. 

“The vein happened to be the gut 
of the Bagginses power system. No» 
body knew they were that advanced! 
Of course, they misunderstood. 
Turned out they have robots too, only 
ones that follow orders instead of 
trying to steal the universe out from

under your nose. They burned us off 
tiie planet.” He made a face. “You 
know what would happen if I tried 
to play chess with you?” 

“I would win. Chess is no compe- 
tition for us.” 

“Yes. Well, that’s how it was. 
They aren’t better armed. As a mat- 
ter of fact most of their weapons 
are copies of ours. But they took us, 
and made us look easy. Then they 
sent their machines out and they 
took us on Robinson’s world too. 
Either they already had a stardrive 
and hadn’t bothered to use it before, 
or else they worked up one like 
that — ” he snapped his fingers past 
his ear — “so as to come after us. Two 
Earthweeks ago their machines hit 
Columbia, a strong, well-established 
colony of almost three thousand peo- 
ple, and they made that look easy 
too. We’re no competition, as you put 
it.” 

Paken went back to his desk and, 
robot or no, sat down, opened that 
bottom left-hand drawer. He hesitat- 
ed, but the consequences of his last 
discourtesy were right there in front 
of him, practically bolted to the desk- 
top. Knowing how silly it sounded he 
said: 

“I need a drink. Will you join me 
in one?” 

“Thank you, no,” said R 391 and, 
amazingly, left the desk to go sit in 
the chair it- was supposed to. 

After the first flush of relief, Paker 
wasn’t sure this was better: It had 
such a hideously tidy way of sitting. 
When he had poured the cognac 
and placed the bottle carefully on the 
spot where his visitor had perched, 
simply — as he told himself — because 


that was where he wanted the bot- 
tle, he said: 

“I was inaccurate at one point ear- 
lier. I gave the impression that 
the Bagginses are in our class. But 
the right way to put it would be to 
say we’re nowhere near theirs.” Then 
he took the first sip of cognac. Now 
he had said it, now he had really said 
it all. 

“I cannot accept that,” it said, 
using that unspeakable courteous 
voice robots always used when they 
were saying something that might of- 
fend you. “Animals of the sort your 
account suggests would not be your 
superiors in any meaningful way. 
They should be the reverse. However, 
I will be able to appraise their ca- 
pacities more accurately after I have 
done the tapes. Now I can say only 
that if the situation is much as you’ve 
described it, we will probably decide 
to help.” 

“How soon can you say?” Paker 
asked, a little too eagerly. “They may 
decide to hit here next.” 

“Shortly. I should like to use your 
private bathroom, please.” 

Paker opened his mouth, but 
nothing was in it to say. Cognac cost 
too much to spill, so he got the glass 
down properly, and then the shock 
started coming out. He began help- 
lessly and horribly to blush. He could 
feel it go all the way down to his 
navel. 

“But!” he yelled, trying not to. “I 
mean, surely you don’tl” 

“I must communicate,” said R 
391, in the same easy, courteous 
voice. “I prefer to do it in private 
and in pleasant, mathematically neat 
surroundings.”

TT7hile it was gone he put away 

* * a good thirty credits’ worth of 
cognac, but his sense of outrage 
burned right through the stuff. There 
were places robots should have ab- 
solutely no business. He felt that 
strongly. And he found that, try as 
he would to stop it, his mind insisted 
on showing him, like a set of smutty 
playing cards, pictures of that thing 
in his bathroom. 

And God alone knew what it 
meant by “communicate.” Certainly 
only a robot would think it was the 
sort of thing you did in private — or 
in his bathroom, with the door 
locked. For he’d heard it lock the 
door in still another burlesque of 
human modesty. 

“Well?” he said angrily when the 
door clicked again and it returned. 

391 stopped before reaching 
his desk and struck a parade rest — 
a position human beings took be- 
cause it was comfortable if you had 
to stand in one place a long time, 
and because, if you were human, 
you always had this problem of 
what to do with your hands. The 
posture infuriated him still further 
because neither problem could oc- 
cur to a robot, ever. 

“Yes,” it said. “You are in a hole, 
as you put it. We will help you.” 

Then it said something else and 
he said, “What?” because he didn’t 
quite hear. But he wasn’t really ask- 
ing. He was too taken up with the 
relief gushing through him, as if his 
blood had only this instant started 
to flow. 

Robots didn’t lie. From an en- 


gineering point of view they coi* 
sidered lying complicated out of all 
proportion to the uses it might have, 
and simply didn’t build in the neces- 
sary circuits. So if this one said they 
would help— they would. 

He hadn’t dll this minute believed 
it; their business in the universe 
seemed to be making things hard, 
not easy. But they were going to 
help! “What?” he said again, more 
to hear that repeated than to hear 
something new. 

“I said, I can tell you a good deal 
about them.” 

“Them?” he repeated. 

“I mean by ‘them’ what you call 
the Bagginses. I have just gone 
through the entire file on Baggins* 
world.” 

“That’s nonsense,” he said. “You 
can’t have.” 

“We investigated the species some 
three hundred Earth years ago. I will 
tell you about them, because it will 
be good for you to know.” 

“Good?” he said. “Look here, 
what have you been doing in my 
bathroom?” 

“I have been communicating,” 
said the robot stiffly. The trouble 
with their voices was you knew every 
bit of expression had been put in 
deliberately, by choice. But expres- 
sion wasn’t something you “put in.” 
It was part of the organism’s total 
functioning, like a yell of pain when 
somebody stepped on your foot, or 
the way blood rushed to the bruised 
spot. 

“In my bathroom?” he said. 
“That’s outrageous!” He didn’t quite 
know what was outrageous, but 
something was.

44^T , 'he Bagginses,” it said, “are a 
A machine-dominated race. I was 
right, incidentally, in saying that they 
were in no significant way your su- 

S eriors. The right conclusion to be 
rawn from the way that you were 
outgeneraled on Columbia and Rob- 
inson’s world is that the machines 
you fought were controlled through 
subspace by a master brain back on 
Baggin’s world. You had no chance.” 
“What you mean is that their ma- 
chines take orders from them,” said 
Paker thickly. “Instead of going off 
on their own hook. That’s what you 
mean by machine-dominated.” 

“You have an excessively bellig- 
erent attitude,” observed R 391. 
“You should remember that under 
too much stimulus circuits burn out 
instead of operating. What I mean by 
saying the Bagginses are what must 
be called a machine-dominated race 
is that their civilization is oriented 
around machines. The Bagginses dis- 
covered about three thousand Earth 
years ago that their emotional needs 
could be entirely satisfied by direct- 
ing an electric current to a nerve 
complex at the base of the eye. Your 
kind once made a similar discovery 
but have escaped its consequences. 
Their civilized development stopped. 
Automata do the work, but, as you 
observed, have not been structured 
to permit independent judgment. This 
is another indication of the Bag- 
ginses’ compulsive need for security, 
a racial drive whose origin the in- 
vestigative team could not deter- 
mine.” 

“Compulsive, hell. It just shows 
they’re smarter than we were.” 
“You are mistaken. Moreover, we 


can predict with a high order of prob- 
ability that this need will lead them 
to seek out and destroy humankind 
wherever you may happen to be. 
We would rather not have hu- 
mans eliminated from the universe; 
therefore we must join forces with 
you in this region until the Baggins- 
es have been destroyed. Their de- 
struction should take, with luck, no 
more than two Earth months.” 

“Just like that, eh? You feel sure 
of yourselves, don’t you?” 

“I am sure my feelings are what 
they should be,” replied R 391 pre- 
cisely. 

Paker put his head on the desk, 
even though the- other was still re- 
garding him from that idiotic parade 
rest. Robots claimed to have feelings, 
but he intended never to believe it. 
There had to be limits. He sat up 
again, put the bottle away, slammed 
shut the drawer. He intended to be 
on his dignity now. 

“I don’t know about that,” he 
said. “But if you’re so great on 
feelings, you must at least know 
what it feels like to be humiliated.” 
There he hesitated, for it came to 
him that probably wasn’t true. When 
would a robot be exposed to humilia- 
tion? “Anyway,” he went on, “you 
ought to know what making a re- 
quest like this does to us. We’re 
fighting you — or would be, if that 
weren’t hopeless. At the least we’re 
in a race with you'for the galaxy. We 
wouldn’t be out here except for that, 
overextended and unprepared as we 
are. It’s mostly your fault. How do 
you think it feels to come begging 
you the way I’ve done? You might 
have spared me being on my knees”

R 391 broke out of his parade 
rest and gestured sympathetically. 

“You misunderstand,” he said. 
“Speaking your way, I do not want 
you or any of the human kind on his 
knees. I want you rather to stand on 
your own feet more. Thus, what you 
have said is absurd.” 

Paker rose, limped around the 
desk “That was cruel,” he said, 
standing in front of the thing and 
close. “A robot did this to me. One 
of your heavy models, not looking 
where it put its feet.” 

“I know the story, and you have 
not said it accurately. MK 30 has 
large feet, requiring fifty square 
decimeters of surface, and when 
gravity came on there was no place 
else to put them. I also know that 
you could have the defective part 
replaced.” 

“It’s not a part. It’s me ” 

T he robot regarded him without 
expression, as if he hadn‘t spok- 
en yet. 

“All right!” It was Paker’s turn to 
sit on the desk. “But a man’s en- 
titled to some privacy. It’s my bath- 
room.” 

“I was communicating, as I have 
already told you. Subuniverse 12, 
which you may not know about yet, 
as human minds are too confused to 
make use of it, is a cosmos consist- 
ing of abstractions or forms, the stuff 
of pure thought. Mind enters it in 
the same way a starship enters Sub- 
U 3, except that one has only to 
think a pattern to create the reality- 
warp, so one does not need sunfield 
generators. However, one does need 
complete freedom to concentrate, 


and I prefer not to turn off my sen- 
sors around humans: That is bad 
manners Also, humans with derange- 
ments like yours have been known to 
attack exposed robots.” 

Paker looked away. 

“Well?” he said. “So what are we 
going to do about the Bagginses? 
What’s this two-month miracle of 
yours?” 

“Our records are three hundred 
years old, but a civilization such as 
I have described is necessarily static. 
The mind synthesis in which I have 
participated suggested that, consid- 
ering the fact that these animals 
have not empowered their machin- 
ery with independent judgment, the 
vulnerable spot should be in the an- 
imals themselves.” 

“Just the point you things would 
fix on.” 

“The problem then becomes one 
of finding a way to deprive these 
animals of independent judgment. 
The surest way, on the basis of the 
information at present available, 
seems to be to destroy the animals 
entirely. They cannot make decisions 
if they do not exist, and without 
them their machines are harmless.” 

“ ‘Trust a robot to state the ob- 
vious,* ” quoted Paker. “You are" 
right now up to where I am — 
where we humans got, I might add, 
without even thinking about it. The 
question is, where do we go from 
here?” 

“I go to Baggins’ world, if you 
can provide me with a probe-class 
ship that is small and fast enough 
to land there without being detected. 
If you cannot, then I go to Betel 4 
where my kind are readying such

a ship, and then to Baggins’ world. 
You,” it added conscientiously, “are 
the one to say where you go, but 
I can think of no reason for you to 
go anyplace out of the ordinary. 
No human needs to change his 
plans. I will take care of this prob- 
lem.” 

Paker stopped before saying what 
he wanted to. “We’re involved too! 
I would like to know your plans so 
as to think about ours. We make up 
our own minds, you know.” 

“Once on Baggins’ world I 
shall try to destroy all these animals. 
You complained that I was stating 
the obvious.” 

He clenched his hands. “Like 
that? You’ll wander around and 
pull their heads off or what? You’re 
just one robot, and these creatures 
by your own admission are a dan- 
ger to the whole humankind. After 
all!” 

R 391 was silent. 

“Plans that are not known cannot 
be anticipated,” it said at last, making 
that deliberate, youthful smile. 

He felt the blood coming back in- 
to his cheeks and stood up, walked 
around behind the thing. He was 
looking out the window at the sky. 
It would darken and then turn some- 
how thin, and darken again. He felt 
something in him — some moral qual- 
ity — tighten, and suddenly and ag- 
onizingly twist back on itself, the 
way a leg will go suddenly bent and 
hard with cramp. 

“I see,” he said. Unhappily, he 
did. What the thing had said was 
right, even if having it said was in- 
tolerable. “Well, we can provide 
the probe-ship. Happens I own a 


modified bug. My plan is to go 
along.” He hadn’t planned that — 
hadn’t, in fact, planned anything un- 
til he said it, but now he found him- 
self suddenly committed. It was his 
ship. “That’s my business, I expect, 
just as what you intend to do is 
yours.” 

R 391 rose and came around and 
considered him. 

“You are old and lame and of 
doubtful usefulness.” It was using 
the polite voice. 

Karl Paker smiled at it. 

“I can hold my own,” he said. 
“One thing, I know how to disable 
a robot of your model. Even with its 
sensors on.” 

Ill 

B ut disabling the thing — even dur- 
ing the time when he could 
have done it — wasn’t the problem. 
The big problem was holding his 
own. 

Over the next two Earthmonths 
he learned how far claiming he 
could took him, how much that easy 
remark committed him to. 

Paker tossed another chunk of 
vegetation into the fire and watched 
the stuff try to crawl out. You would 
never think that messy green tangle 
could move unless you tried to 
burn it. But there it was, scrabbling 
wildly at the six-inch wall of earth 
R 391 had put up to hold his fires 
together. 

Perhaps, for that matter, it couldn’t 
move until you put it in a fire. God 
knew he himself had been doing 
things for five weeks now so far out- 
side what he could, that in the nor- 


82 


IF 



mal course he wouldn’t even have 
tried — all in the name of holding 
his own. 

“Robot!” he called, when the vege- 
tation stopped struggling. 

R 391 was sitting on a rock some 
twenty feet away, wearing a green 
sportshirt in forty degrees of frost. 
But its nose was red, as if with cold. 
Paker wondered a good deal about 
that. 

“I hear you,” it said. 

“It’s fifteen hours, Earth, time. 
Your two months are up.” 

The thing regarded him. 

“Well, they’re still kicking,” said 
Paker, shifting around so he could 
reach the farther pile of vegetation 
with* his lone hand. 

“We have failed. I thought that 
you already knew this.” 

“I did.” 

“Then I do not understand you. 
You must have been aware of the 
fact that I already knew it.” 

He was too cold to laugh, but he 
could still make the right face to go 
with the kind of laughter he was 
thinking. 

“I expect I knew that too.” 

“Then there is something wrong 
with you. As I have explained three 
times now, communication is an 
asymmetrical' relation with respect 
to the information communicated. 
Thus, if you — ” 

“I’ve had about enough of your 
communication,” broke in Paker sav- 
agely. “That’s one word we could 
do without.” He threw a new lump 
into the fire. “It’s not as if you were 
always saying new things yourself 
all the time. Oh, no.” 

“Perhaps you need a new trench,” 


observed the robot. “Though I dug 
the last one only five days ago. If 
you would not eat so much — ” 

“I eat to stay warm!” he shouted. 
Then he sat back, bracing himself 
on the plastic sheath where his 
right hand had been. He tried to 
stop jumping inside. How many times 
had the thing said something like 
that over the past week? Something 
that, if you could believe a robot 
could want to, had to be a calcu- 
lated attempt to goad him on? 

A robot’s mind didn’t work by free 
association. If it got from the idea of 
communication to the idea of his 
trench, it got there according to a 
strict deductive order. In which case 
what were the postulates? Was the 
general idea to irritate hell out of 
him? He couldn’t quite believe it had 
that in mind; but just in case this was 
possible, he was going to remain very 
calm. 

“What I mean is,” he went on, to 
be saying something, “where do we 
go now? What next?” 

“You should die within fifteen 
or twenty days, but you may last a 
little longer. Predicting humans in 
this respect is difficult. When you are 
dead, I shall turn myself off.” 
“After you’ve had the fun of 
seeing me go ... I wish it had got 
us.” 

“The hovercar machine probably 
had orders only to protect the young 
animals, as I have explained repeat- 
edly. When we no longer endangered 
them, it forgot about us. Such ma- 
chines cannot decide to do some- 
thing on their own.” 

“So turn yourself off.” 

“I will not be rude.”

P aker considered its nose for a 
while, then went on. “Why do I 
waste my time talking to you, I 
wonder? Two Earthmonths ago I 
would have crawled through fire 
first.” 

“Humans are 1 a n g u a g e-struc- 
tured,” explained R 391 “You are 
under stress and require the conso- 
lation of jabbering. However, you 
have not listened to what I say since 
I fixed your arm.” 

“But you say it anyhow. Why? 
Just so I can hear the sound of your 
pretty voice?” 

“I try to think of what I say as 
though I were your mother, but 
perhaps I make mistakes. Working 
with metaphors is difficult.” 

Paker kept very still for a mo- 
ment. 

“Some time you’ll go too far,” he 


breathed. 

“I shall not go so far as off this 
planet, in all probability,” observed 
the robot. “Still, unlike you, I can 
always be switched back on.” It 
executed a different, brotherly smile. 

Paker turned his back in spite of 
the cold. In his imagination he could 
see the landing party — robots, prob- 
ably — stuffing his stiff form into a 
black undertaker’s bag and bringing 
back movement to R 391 by turn- 
ing a switch. Of course, if they were 
robots they wouldn’t have a black 
bag; but that was what he saw them 
using all the same. 

The worst part was he couldn’t 
blame it for their failure. Not hon- 
estly. Animals, as the thing had ex- 
plained once they were down and far 
enough away from the Hermes to be 
safe, were convenient to destroy not

you, but you are sloppy inside and 
forget things. You may use whatever 
mathematics you like to describe the 
problem, and I cancel out in every 
case. The Bagginses’ master brain 
can coordinate more data than I, 
and it incorporates similar struc- 
tures. As I cancel out, in the rele- 
vant sense I do not exist. You can- 
not say of something that does not 
exist that it is a quitter.” 

It really meant that, Paker de- 
cided. That was the trouble with a 
mathematically precise language. 
When a robot went wrong, it went 
all the way. A human managed to 
spread out the error — just because 
the language was sloppy. Like hu- 
man minds; something you could 
never quite trust. 

But something that could meet 
change, too. As a sloppy human you 
were always up against something 
new, and had to keep your meanings 
loose to deal with it. So you could 
mean something new. You could 
make meanings; that was the secret 
of good questions. But a robot could 
only work over things until they 
fitted already established meanings, 
and, if that didn't work, give it up. 

“ I still itch in the hand I don’t 
have,” he explained. “I even try to 
use it.” 

“You will tell me when these 
attempts begin to succeed.” 

P aker looked up. “You miss the 
point,” he said, but despaired 
of making clear just what the point 
was. That was how it worked: You 
said something you didn’t mean or 
understand even, and then you had 
to create a meaning for it. “I mean,” 


he tried, "we’re here and damn it, 
it’s cold. We ought to do something.” 
“I am still here,” observed R 391, 
"in the sense of being able to dig 
trenches, to lift heavy objects or to 
lay fires. You can do small, simple 
things like opening food sacks.” 
Paker was quiet, since one thing 
he couldn’t do any more was take 
out an R model. 

“I suppose I’ll have to put some 
kind of gadget on that stump,” he 
said into air. “I don’t like it, but 
it's too unhandy without.” 

“That is true.” 

He glared at it. “Look here. Why 
don’t you go away? That’s something 
else you can do. If you went far 
enough away you could turn yourself 
off without being rude, you know.” 
“You would freeze.” It got down 
from the rock — a handsome twenty- 
year-old whose breath didn’t frost 
at minus forty. But it had a red nose. 

“Look,” it said, squatting beside 
him and extending a right hand com- 
plete with fingernails and light brown 
hairs. “Your kind cannot make one 
so good. This is an efficient model. 
If you were equipped with one you 
would not even want to go back 
to the organic sort, it would seem 
so much less useful. For example, 
with this you would be able to hold 
together the materials for a fire while 
it got started well, without being 
burned.” It flexed the fingers at 
him. “I would like to go away and 
switch myself off. I have no pur- 
pose here worthy of the name, and 
I am unhappy. But while I have 
this and you do not, you are depenr 
dent on me and I must remain.” 

“Oh, unhappy,” said Paker hutch-

mg from it a few steps around 
the fire. “Go on!” But God knew he 
was dependent on it — not just for 
creature comforts, but for survival. 
Or would be, if he had any chance 
of surviving. 

“You know,” he brought out, “I 
may not have two good feet to 
stand on, but one hand is plenty 
to sit on.” 

“You have made another of your 
nonsensical remarks,” said R 391 
in a gloomy voice. Of course, a voice 
like that was calculated, but with 
what intention? Did he really care 
what its intention was? It was try- 
ing to do something to him, any- 
way. 

“What I mean is,” he said, “if 
I’m here to die, I can do it all by 
myself. I don’t need your help. If 
I could turn you off it would be in 
the bag and — ” and there he stopped, 
because he was thinking of something 
else now. 

He saw a way. 

“Listen!” he told it, shouting over 
a distance of two feet. “Think of 
yourself as a Baggins machine.” He 
paused for a moment, because that 
was a pleasant thought. “And hu- 
mankind is this green stuff you’ve 
got to hold down while it gets to 
burning. Now if we take away you, 
I — I’m the Bagginses, I guess — 
freeze to death, isn’t that right?” 

“I do not know,” said R 391 in 
a minute. “Thinking of these three 
entities this way is awkward.” 

“We should have known from the 
start! Of course! The thing to do 
is hit the machinery!” 

“Destroying mechanical lifeforms 
is poor strategy.” 


“The brain, robot! The master 
brain! And, stupid, you didn’t think 
of it!” 

R 391 inspected the fire for a 
minute. Then it put its face through 
a complete Smile. 

“I almost might have predicted 
that you would think of such a 
plan,” it said, when it was finished 
with the smile. “It could succeed, 
however.” 

“And you didn’t think of it,” re- 
peated Paker, who was quite warm 
now, even to the ends of all his 
toes.

B ut after that he wasn’t warm 
again for so long it might 
have been forever. They marched 
crosscountry for three days to reach 
what, on the three-hundred-year-old 
map in R 391’s brain, looked like 
a good point to dig into a tunnel 
complex, and all that time they had 
no fire. Every four hours R 391 
halted. They would stare at each 
other while the stiffness sank into 
Paker’s joints and his breathing came 
back to normal; then they were jog- 
ging on again. 

Paker didn’t ask for the halts. 
Hadn’t he said he could hold his 
own? But he knew R 391 could 
have gone the whole distance with- 
out stopping, and every four hours 
he took the break without a word. 
It wasn’t enough, of course; per- 
haps that made it easier to take. 
But he knew. 

For the rest, he depended on med- 
icines to hold his own the little 

green pills that would clean his

blood, let him go on, on, on, with- 
out sleep; the white pills when his 
balance got too shakey; the purple 
pills when he needed spurts of en- 
ergy; the bigger white pills whose 
use he had forgotten. He didn’t have 
enough, and he was counting the 
precious green ones again, trying 
to make the count come out slightly 
higher, when the robot said, “We 
will dig here,” almost casually, as 
if it were telling him the world was 
a small place, wasn’t it? He stag- 
gered on another thirty steps, count- 
ing helplessly. Then he got himself 
stopped and turned around, and 
then he dropped. 

He sat and watched the thing 
sink into the ground without so much 
as pretending he could help — in 
spite of its “we.” His underwear was 
supposedly good for fifty degrees of 
frost, but that wasn’t true. He was 
brittle with cold. Was this the plan- 
et he’d claimed you could go around 
on in the raw? 

Then, without knowing how, he 
was somewhere in the dark leaning 
on a too-human shoulder and he 
pushed away. That he hadn’t been 
going to do. He wanted to cry, but he 
couldn’t do that either. It was warm 
again, all except his soul, and sud- 
denly on his left he heard harsh 
breathing. The robot brushed by him, 
moving fast, and he heard a fuzzy 
sound and then a sharp crack ! 

“What was that?” he said, but 
couldn’t control his voice and it 
came out only one vowel, a sort of 
nasal bubble. Perfect fingers gently 
pressed against his mouth. He had 
to hold in hard not to bite. 

They went on down. It was never 


possible for him to lead, but the plan 
was his, so he was leading in that 
sense. More, he was taking care of 
himself now, even if his bad foot 
came down too hard now and then. 
He could hold his own. After all, 
they’d been in the tunnels before . 

From time to time they passed 
vague little clouds of pink light 
along the left wall, clouds dilating 
and contracting regularly, like a 
heartbeat. Once the pink flared out 
as he went by and he saw a square, 
naked compartment, and in the far 
corner something — more a mass than 
a shape. It changed and uttered a 
noise of some sort. 

Then he was past. Had that been 
the enemy? But what was the noise it 
made? A moan of pleasure, maybe. 
He had seen pictures of Bagginses: 
small, brown-skinned, wrinkly-look- 
ing creatures almost like elves. Mir- 
aculously close to the human. You 
wanted to talk to them. You 
could talk to them, if only a little, 
and there was the true miracle. In 
all those centuries of exploration and 
expansion humankind hadn’t found 
anyone else to talk to, not counting 
robots. And of course you didn’t 
count robots. 

But he didn’t want to talk to that . 

T ^hey went down, on what seemed 
to him a long spiral, and there were 
no more pink lights. The darkness 
sank away for a long time, always 
curving a little toward his game 
side. The robot was leading him by 
the hand now, as if he were a three- 
year-old. With his other thumb — the 
one he didn’t have any more — stuck 
in his mouth, probably. 


88 


IF 



Suddenly they were in the middle 
of a great hissing. Up ahead was 
something giant that filled up the 
black, coming at them. 

He was flung flat against the wall. 
Breath went out of him; the hissing 
rushed up to a roar all around. He 
was sick and desperate trying to 
breathe, the air pulled from his 
mouth. The robot held him flat. 
There was no room; he had to bend 
over. 

Then he was breathing and the 
darkness was clear again. The hiss- 
ing got smaller up the way they had 
come; abruptly what must be a 
bend cut it in half. 

‘‘That was a hovercar transport,” 
explained R 391, speaking, incred- 
ibly, in a normal voice, so that for 
an instant the darkness seemed td 
jump at Paker from half a dozen 
places. “We are close to the diffi- 
cult part of our mission now. Thirty- 
four meters ahead, if I have measured 
accurately, is the conveyor belt which 
that transport just left. I do not 
know how fast the belt moves. How- 
ever, seventy kilometers distant in 
the direction of its movement, the 
belt should pass a wall on the other 
side of which are located the control 
circuits to be destroyed. The belt 
is the best approach, according to 
my map. You are tired, and you 
are in a comparatively safe place. I 
will go on from here alone.” 

Even at five or six inches he 
couldn’t see its face, but he suspected 
it was doing the boyish smile: Go 
suck your thumb, old man. This calls 
for youth — or metal. Paker passed 
the wrong hand over his face; his 
mind lurched a little. 


“I can manage.” He said it with- 
out expression, fighting the heaviness 
of his breathing. But he said noth- 
ing about holding his own. That was 
behind him now. 

“I cannot undertake to be respon- 
sible for your safety once I am on 
the conveyor belt. I will be busy 
with more important things than 
you.” 

Paker closed his eyes. He let 
breath out hugely, even though its 
face might be right there. 

“Look here,” he said. “You can 
never be responsible for me. Do you 
understand that? Never. Not for a 
minute. It’s our battle, and I’m go- 
ing on. You’d better try to under- 
stand that, too.” 

“I will make the situation clear. 
I may have to do more than simply 
to ignore you. If I find that your 
presence is likely to interfere with 
what I must do, I will be obliged to 
render you inoperative.” 

For a moment Paker just breathed. 
Why didn’t it say “kill?” 

“I’ll manage,” he repeated, and 
started by it in the dark. 

S o they went on together. The belt 
was slow and he lay on his back 
letting the blackness slide over him 
and slide over him. He was sleepy. 
Here! Biting at his lips didn’t help. 
Would the robot wake him or mere- 
ly let him go on, riding slowly into 
the limbo of this hideous world? In 
any case he couldn’t ask. A question 
of pride more than of a broken neck; 
his muscles were too sore for him to 
sit up. While your eyes were open 
you could stay awake, but how to 
be sure your eyes were open still?

And then something had him by 
the shoulder and R 391’s voice was 
at him, too close in the darkness. 

“In three Earth minutes I will 
say to you, ‘Run!* and when I say 
that you must face back the way we 
haye come and run as rapidly as 
possible.” 

His shoulder was his own again. 
Paker sat up, shuddering. Seven pills 
remained in the hip pouch and be- 
cause his fingers couldn’t tell which 
was which he swallowed them all. 

When the robot shouted at him — 
shoutedl — he started to run, only 
to find that he was already run- 
ning, leaning away from his lame 
side as if to leave it behind, going 
furiously, all but galloping. 

The air boomed out, again, again. 
Behind and over his left shoulder a 
sudden great jag of white broke 
the dark. Then something moved 
abruptly and the crash detonated — 
inside his ears this time. He tried to 
shake it out, blinking hard. Be- 
hind, the darkness caved slowly in- 
to a pale green, and there was a 
room, long and with something like a 
giant starship drive for one wall. 
A blur went through the hole while 
it was still widening, and then he 
turned and lunged for all that light. 

He fell. 

He was on his knees at the mid- 
dle of the belt arid overhead the 
hole passed by. Well, said something 
odd inside him, at least you were 
headed in the right direction. Then 
he screamed and was running again. 
He caught up with the hole without 
any trouble. When he fell again he 
was able to grab the edge with his 
single hand. 


For an instant he simply hung 
there, his heels skittering away from 
him helplessly. He hooked the other 
elbow into the opening and pulled 
himself toward it. Head. And shoul- 
ders. 

His feet found purchase and he 
pushed himself up and through. 

The floor was probably a meter or 
so lower than the conveyor belt, and 
as he fell a gout of blue-white kicked 
under him. Then he dropped through 
where it had been and slammed flat, 
nose first, and he was weeping and 
trying to breathe and rolling all at 
once, and around the heat swirled 
like heavy windswept smoke. 

Almost where he had fallen a 
young man in a flaming sports shirt 
crouched behind a cabinet: Robot 
R 391. A huge hovercar filled the 
entrance across the room, its bump- 
er pressed against the sides. As the 
robot moved from one side of the 
cabinet to the other a gun on top of 
the aircar moved too, keeping almost 
exact pace with its opponent; and 
just as the robot reached the edge 
that blue- white slammed out. The 
air was alive with heat. 

Then Paker saw the thing that was 
most of the right wall, and that 
wasn’t like a starship drive at all. 
He forgot the battle in the middle 
of the room. 

What it did look like was a giant 
secondary circuit for an R model. Not 
quite the same, but awfully close. 
The main difference was that where, 
on an R model, the secondary would 
have hooked into a decision-making 
component, this thing led to a strip 
of knobs and a viewplate of some 
kind. And before the viewplate, in 


90 


IF 



a tiny chair, sagged a Baggins, look- 
ing a bit like soggy pudding. The way 
any animal looked after you hit it 
with an organic scrambler. 

But apparently it had been able 
to feed in the decisive order first. 

And what good was a scrambler 
against that thing at the door? 

Suddenly R 391 went over the top 
of the cabinet. The gun was a lit- 
tle behind, and the bolt caught it in 
the legs. The robot spun completely 
around in the air and dropped back 
behind the cabinet with a crash that 
Paker felt over here, in his eyes. 
Above the cabinet, where its legs 
had been, uncoiled a little puff of 
gray smoke; the robot lay motionless. 
And who could blame it? 

So now came his turn. Paker 
played his scrambler over the aircar 
on the off chance it had a Baggins 
operator, then threw his weapon at 
it. No response. Slowly he stood up 
and he was still there, not a crash 
of imploding air. 

The gun was still fixed on the 
cabinet. 

What if it was impossible? He was 
the one with feet to stand on now. 

He bet himself that he wouldn’t 
get three steps, and then that he 
wouldn’t get three more. And three 
more. The next one would put him 
into the line of fire. His legs wouldn’t 
take it, neither of them. So Paker 
lay down and rolled. Then he stood 
up, but he didn’t have to bet himself 
any more. 

H e walked all the way across and 
he was standing over the tau 
node of what was, for all practical 
purposes, an R model. 


In disabling an R model you had 
to hook into the navel — if you could 
stand to think of its having a navel 
— and pull left hard with one hand, 
reach in with the other and twist 
Right here! That was about what 
an R model itself did, when it turned 
off its sensors. In effect, you wero 
making a closed system of the elab- 
orate set of chemical imbalances that 
served a robot for thought. 

Only he couldn’t. The thing was 
too big. He hadn’t strength enough. 
But it didn’t matter. He had time 
enough to detach the connecting 
lines one by one. He was jerking at 
a red and yellow one when the hiss- 
ing stopped — the hissing that he 
hadn’t really heard — and behind 
him the hover car sank like soft 
thunder to the floor. 

Muscles relaxed all along his back. 
He worked the remaining three lines 
free and wiped the sweat from his 
face and neck. His hand came away 
completely red. Nosebleed. 

Then Paker sat down and laughed. 
What he wanted to do was shout, 
“I’m king of the mountain!” He 
hadn’t said that in maybe forty- 
five Earth years; but he hadn’t felt 
it in about that long either. And now 
he was horribly tired — even if he 
was king of the mountain. So hap- 
pily, he only thought about how 
funny it would be for a man his 
age to say something as young and 
as vainglorious as that, no matter 
what he might feel. Happily he did 
no more, because while he was still 
laughing a young voice said: 

“If you can help me up to my 
knees and over to that hovercar, 
and if it has independent controls. 


THE COMPETITORS 


91 



we should try to finish this job 
promptly. I have been in communi- 
cation with my people, but we will 
have to secure our advantage for 
the next seven Earth weeks.” 

And, looking over, he saw R 391 
modestly take its finger from its 
navel. 

4 4T ook here,” said Paker, sham- 

-L* bling over to the haphazard 
wheelchair they had constructed for 
R 391, “I can face up to it when 
I’ve been wrong. Or I can try, any- 
how. But emotions ! I still can’t 
swallow that.” 

He waved his hand before it un- 
certainly, and sat down on the bump- 
er of the hovercar. One of the thou- 
sand things he had learned these 
four Earth months was that he 
shrugged with his hands rather than 
his shoulders. Trying to do it with 
one hand was like hopping when 
you wanted to run. A bad feeling. 
He looked at the sky with its ridicu- 
lous green sun, then back at R 39 f. 
There was a streak of rust over 
its right eyebrow that made the 
thing’s face, for Paker, immensely 
more bearable, almost nice in fact. 
What he wanted to say was, “I 
would respect you if you were the 
kind of thing it is possible to re- 
spect.” 

But he couldn’t say that. Nor was 
it quite right, either. But there was 
a need to say it, and the need had 
been with him and stronger every 
day since they worked their way out 
of that monster- warren, always in his 
mouth, and making him say alto- 
gether too many other things. 

So he went on talking, when what 


he really needed was a good slug 
of cognac. 

R 391 continued to regard him 
silently. This was apparently one of 
its days for not speaking unless you 
put everything to it in the form 
of a question. 

“I mean,” he tried, “why don’t 
you come back and help man?” 
Which wasn’t what he meant at all. 

“You should not ask that after 
your exposure to Baggins culture. 
When we discovered this world three 
hundred Earth years ago, we de- 
cided to leave it alone so that your 
kind could see what happens when 
mechanical lifeforms and animals 
cooperate. You disappoint me, Ques- 
tions Controller.” 

He was quiet for a moment be- 
cause this was news. After all their 
conversations on Baggins’ world 
the thing still withheld information, 
waiting for him to find the right 
question. He, God knew, hadn’t any 
secrets left! 

He looked at the sky again, then 
asked: 

“Well? What happens?” 
“Machines dominate.” 

“But if we take precautions? 
We’re pretty shrewd, you know.” 
“Your kind cannot well take more 
precautions than did the Bagginses.” 
Another reminder that he’d run 
no real danger crossing that hours- 
long room, what with that giant 
brain not having enough discretion to 
tell a nosebleed from a friend, as 
long as the nosebleed was walking 
around in a friendly way? He’d heard 
too much about that six Earth weeks 
ago. He wasn’t so sure, either. Or it 
might just mean what it said: you 


92 


IF 



couldn't take more precautions, not 
possibly. 

And this was true. 

Paker made a vague guttural 
noise. Let it figure out whether he 
was agreeing or not. He tried the 
other side: 

“General idea is, you’re doing 
your best to dominate right now.” 
“Such an idea is absurd. I am too 
polite to suppose that you could en- 
tertain it.” 

“But suppose I do?” 

The radio R 391 had tricked to- 
gether began to gabble in the hover- 
car cabin, and he limped three steps 
over and leaned into the door and 
pushed on the key. “Paker here,” he 
said, amazed at the everyday sound 
of his voice. “I am sending.” Then 
he moved the pointer to where a 
long, nervous tone began to trickle 
from the set and weighed down the 
key with a rock ready there for the 
purpose. Standing erect he looked to 
the north where a ship was likely 
to come in. But he couldn’t see the 
fire trail, if there was one. He went 
back to his seat on the bumper. 

“Not long now. Well? Suppose I 
do? What are you up to if you’re 
not trying to beat us?” 

“I am structured against supposing 
a thing so impolite.” 

“I’ve noticed you can get around 
that kind of structure when it suits 
you to.” 

It was silent. 

But wasn’t the answer plain 
enough, once you looked at robots 
sympathetically? Once you realized 
there could be that particular ques- 
tion. Once you’d gone through what 
he had. 


“You’re pushing us,” he said. “The 
whole business of galactic expan- 
sion, the whole faked-out competi- 
tion, is just a thing you’ve set up to 
keep us going. Not to let us get any 
rest, ever.” 

“Animals tend to exaggerate their 
need for rest,” agreed R 391. 

“Just like you pushed me. You 
made us camp ten degree? of latitude 
farther north than necessary. Why? 
Because you figured the cold would 
keep me working. That’s why you 
were riding me all the time, too. It 
wasn’t really bad feeling.” Paker 
rose, creaking. “Also, I know that 
when you got it in the legs that was 

calculated. You were still pushing 

„ 11 
me. 

R 391 said nothing and he walked 
on by it and stood looking out 
toward a streak of purple forest and 
above it the open sky. 

If you were a made thing, then 
your reason for being was somewhere 
outside you — in those others, your 
creators. You existed to serve them. 
And in yourself you were nothing. 
You had to have them. You couldn’t 
originate a purpose — not on the fun- 
damental level — any more than you 
could originate a new question. 

What you could do, though, was 
use what was in you to the limit. 

“Wasn’t this it?” he went on. 
“Somewhere back when you decided 
we were going soft, like the Bag- 
ginses. The problem was, we were 
alone out in space. No contest. No- 
body ever came up to our mark, 
and probably we were starting not 
to come up to it too — leaning on 
you too much for own good. So 


THE COMPETITORS 


93 



you decided the best way to serve 
us was to set up some hard compe- 
tition.” How long had he known 
this? Well, for a long time and only 
just this moment, both. “To get us 
back on our feet.” 

He came around to where R 391 
could see him. 

“I guess what I want to say is — 
thank God you were able to decide.” 
Was he going to blush now, of 
all damned things? 

“You asked me earlier about my 
emotions,” said the robot. “ ‘Feelings* 
would be the better word. I think 
I can make you understand them.” 

“I want to do that.’* 

“You must not think of a feeling 
as something that happens inside 
you. Without an environment you 
would never feel anything. A feeling 


is, in essence, the relation your 
structure has to your environment.” 

“You fit or you don’t,” he agreed, 
but he was not sure he really un- 
derstood. 

“Perhaps that is correct. But I am 
explaining my feelings. My ideal en- 
vironment is a mathematical one 
similar to subuniverse 12, starting 
with self-evident axioms and work- 
ing itself out into a closed system of 
a high order of complexity. In such 
an environment I would be perfectly 
happy.” 

Paker considered. 

“And in the environment contain- 
ing human beings?” he asked. \ 

R 391 smiled carefully. 

“Well, then, as you would say. I 
hate you. I also hate all your kind.”

THE CAR POOL 


/ 


BY FRANK BANTA 


Never play poker with a worm — 
especially when it’s an alien I 


T he leader worm, known in the 
Earth translation as The Hell 
Of A Long One — he was three me 
ters long and approximately one- 
half-meter thick — wriggled happily 
on his white porcelain throne. <f What 
beautiful porcelain we shall have 
with the calcined bones of these two 
Earthmen, Cards Wartson and Nov- 
ice Howard!” 

The other three worms were also 
overjoyed, as well as sycophantic. 
“Such lovely, lovely porcelain!” they 
chanted, wriggling in time. 

Cards Wartson and Novice “No- 
sey” Howard, lying guarded on the 


floor, saw objections to the plan. 
Cards reminded the worms, “You 
can just quit wriggling for joy now. 
You can’t use our bones, because 
we’ve still got us wrapped around 
them!” 

“That can be remedied,” crooned 
the leader. “And it should be, when 
Earthmen come around we Martians 
and want to play poker, and then 
can’t pay off when they lose.” 

The other worms tittered delight- 
edly. 

“You gave me a fast shuffle with 
those thousand legs of yours,” com- 
plained Cards. “Those cards whizzed 


95 


around in a circle so fast I couldn’t 
follow them at all.” 

“Yes, but he’d have won anyway, 
with you always trying to fill those 
inside straights,” interjected Nosey 
critically. Then he looked at his 
captors. “But / don’t owe you worms 
anything. I wasn’t even playing cards 
with you.” 

“No,” retorted The Hell Of A 
Long One, “you were just snooping 
around where you had no business 
to be. Probably prying into our por- 
celain making secrets. And you up- 
set a cabinet of my clay tablets, 
breaking half of them.” 

“I can’t help it if you don’t have 
paper on this planet,” shrugged How^ 
ard. “We’d trade you paper if you 
wanted it. When you make every- 
thing out of sand and dirt it’s bound 
to be brittle.” 

“Especially when clumsy spies 
come around,” leered the leader, 
once again exciting the merriment of 
the other worms. 

“As art dealers, we of course are 
interested in your porcelain art ob- 
jects,” replied Howard stiffly, trying 
to cover his idle snooping with a little 
dignity. 

“Anyway interrupted Wartson, 
“what ever makes you want to put 
bone ash in your porcelain paste? 
You’ll just come out with medium 
hard paste. There surely isn’t any 
sale for anything but hard-paste por- 
celain — why, this medium-paste 
stuff isn’t worth the freight to 
Earth.” 

“Bone ash is so rare on this plan- 
et,” explained The Hell Of A Long 
One dreamily. “We worms have no 
bones, nor have any of the other 


fauna on the planet. Only fossils re- 
main to us.” 

“But still,” Wartson said in disgust, 
“soft paste is soft paste.” 

“Ah, but the new pastels! The 
new, delicate shades we shall dis- 
cover!” breathed the leader worm 
ecstatically. “Who would want to sell 
beauty such as that?” 

Wartson and Howard could see 
they weren’t going to talk the mon- 
ster out of it. “Well, let’s deal an- 
other hand,” said Cards resignedly, 
reaching for the deck. “Double or 
nothing, what do you say?” 

I t had all begun earlier in the 
day, when the four art dealers 
drove down the dried-up canal in 
their jointly owned space car toward 
Erlanger, the home village of The 
Hell Of A Long One. They had had 
premonitions — from long experi- 
ence — of the disasters to come. 

Jock Hickerson was driving, and 
he gave the first admonition. 
“Cards,” he rasped, “quit trying to 
beat these natives at poker!” 

“Now you know that with a rea- 
sonable amount of luck — ” 

“Which you haven’t had any of 
the last twenty years!” 

“I got the old finesse, anyway,” 
said Cards proudly. 

“Sure you have!” flung back Jock. 
“You fill those inside straights of 
yours one out of every 565 times!” 
“I wish you could miss banging up 
the flaps of this space car that 
often,” retorted Cards. 

“I don’t know what you’re talk- 
ing about,” said Jock loftily. 

“Just stop this can for a minute 
and I’ll point out its scars to you!”

IF 



returned Cards. “I swear, I don’t 
know how she holds air out in space 
any more. Can’t you keep away 
from these stone canal walls?” 

“I have to dodge the sand dunes.” 

The other art dealer member of 
the car pool, a half-breed Indian 
named Teepee McGuzzle interposed 
sadly, “This sure is a dry place.” 

“I hope those worms haven’t got 
anything to make it wetter for you 
either,” said Howard. “All we need 
is to have you on another roaring 
toot.” 

“You can’t roar when you toot,” 
pointed out Teepee with some justi- 
fication. 

“You make a mighty fine try at 
it,” said Jock. 

“It was dirty of you fellows to 
thieve away my grog at the space 
port,” mourned Teepee. “People 
are so undercover any more that a 
fellow doesn’t know what to think. 
Twenty years ago if people wanted 
to be dishonest they did it out in the 
open, where you could see them. 
Nowadays people are so sneaky you 
can hardly tell what they are doing 

— even if you watch them.” 

“You should have stayed on the 

reservation,” advised Cards. 

“If I had stayed on the Seminole 
reservation we wouldn’t have this 
space car pool and be saving oodles 
of travel expense, because I’m the 
one who got the idea in the first 
place,” said Teepee. 

“Here’s the town we’re looking for 

— Erlanger,” interjected Howard as 
a hundred half-oval, white porcelain 
structures loomed up in the early 
morning dust. 

A few minutes later they were 


conferring with The Hell Of A Long 
One — or rather, Cards was. Ignor- 
ing his business as a porcelain art 
dealer, he drew a deck of cards 
from his pocket and proceeded to 
explain the principles of stud poker 
to the worm. The other art dealers 
were unable to get in a word. Nov- 
ice Howard wandered into another 
room of the ovular structure and 
snooped where he did not belong. 
Teepee went hunting for alcohol. 
Jock dozed in a corner. 

T he two disasters happened to- 
gether. Just as Cards Wartson 
got to owing far more than he could 
pay, the worms heard a crash in the 
next room. Rushing in, they discov- 
ered the broken clay records. Jock 
awoke at Teepee’s urgent nudging. 

“Come on, we gotta get outa 
here!” 

“What’s going on?” 

“Cards owes them a pot of money 
and Nosey broke something. They 
are going to kill both of them! Let’s 
get out of here before they grab us!” 
“Why should they grab us? We 
haven’t done anything.” 

“Wait until they find out I drank 
up all their moss squeezing!” 

“Good God!” said Jock, running 
for the door. The two men did not 
stop running until they were safely 
locked in the space car. 

“Well, let’s get back to the space 
port,” urged Teepee when they had 
got their breath. 

“What for?” asked Jock, surprised. 
“To get some weapons. Rescue 
Cards and Nosey.” 

“We don’t need any weapons at 
all to whip those monsters.” 


THE CAR POOL

“I’m not wrestling with any three- 
meter worms,” Teepee said decisive- 

ly- 

“Me either. So here’s what we’re 
going to do. We’ll crash into the side 
of the building, on the side the 
worms are on, and before the worms 
get over the surprise we’ll grab up 
Cards and Nosey and be on our 
way.” 

“Don’t you think maybe those 
porcelain walls are too thick?” ob- 
jected Teepee. “Maybe we’ll just tear 
up our ship.” 

“Not if we hit her hard enough! 
Let’s just slide back the plastic top 
now, so we’ll be ready for a fast 
grab when we crash in!” 

“Let her rip!” said Teepee, drunk- 
enly sliding back the greenhouse. 

They embarked upon the crazy 
scheme, backing off a hundred me- 
ters and then ramming the building 
at the vehicle’s top ground speed. 
However, the space sedan, instead 
of breaking into the white porce- 
lain, ran up the slick side of the 
building. Just as it arrived at a large 
ventilator hole in the top of the oval 
structure, it flipped over, and the 
two men tumbled down into the 
waiting grasp of the monsters. 

Teepee was the first to get to his 
feet. “There’s just one little old thing 
I want to say,” he declared, weav- 
ing a little, “and that is, I'm so glad 
to be here!” 

“I am glad you enjoy our com- 
pany,” returned The Hell Of A Long 
One. 

“It’s not that,” said Teepee. “It's 
just that I want to confess. If there’s 
anything I can’t stand, it’s an under- 
cover thief.” 


“Kindly continue.” 

“I drank up your moss squeez- 
ings,” Teepee said humbly. 

“Stole our nectar!” 

“Drank every drop.” 

“You’ll catch it now! More cal- 
cined bones!” 

“1 suppose so. That fermented 
spinach was the lousiest nectar I 
ever drank, too. Sure wasn’t worth 
what I’m going to pay for it.” 

Nosey Howard felt the urge too. 
“I also want to confess. When I 
broke your clay plates I was really 
snooping into your sex lives. I 
thought there might be some dirty 
jokes on them.” 

“Dirty jokes?” the H. A. Long 
One asked, mystified. 

“You know. Slightly abnormal 
sex practices.” 

“I can’t imagine what you mean.” 
“Well, on Earth for instance, a 
male and female after consorting 
for two or three evenings without 
mating may — ” 

He whispered busily. “You 
mean they may not mate the 
instant they sight each other?” 
asked The Hell Of A Long One, as 
he and his fellow monsters burst in- 
to frenzied fits of laughter. “So that’s 
what dirty jokes are! No wonder you 
go to such extreme lengths to get 
new ones. Tell us more dirty jokes.” 
“Well,” said Nosey Howard, rid- 
ing high, “there was this old maid — 
I mean this female — who never 
did — ” 

“Never did! Stop it, you are ex- 
cruciating! I can’t stand it!” gasped 
the worm, writhing his thousand 
legs together in merriment “She 
never did!”

IF 



D o you have to keep scraping 
this can against the sides of 
the canal?” complained Wartson as 
the foursome made their way down 
the canal, weaving around the sand 
dunes in their battered space car. 
“You’re going to break this whole 
case of porcelain figurines. 

“That’s the thanks I get for get- 
ting us out of that mess,” Jock said 
complacently as he recklessly 
whizzed from one side to the other 
of the stone-walled throughway. 

“Yes, you were a big help,” an- 
swered Nosey Howard caustically. 
He tenderly cradled his armload of 
Martian clay tablets. “Instead of go- 
ing to the spaceport for weapons, 
you dump your no-good selves right 
back in there again! / was the one 


who got them back in good humor.” 
He added with pride, “Wait until they 
get that Emily Post book I prom- 
ised them; they’ll tear themselves 
apart laughing!” 

“How about that Everglades 
moonshine I promised them?” quer- 
ied Teepee McGuzzle, waving a 
souvenir nectar pot. “It’ll turn that 
yellow fuzz of theirs . a mildew 
green!” 

“They’ll never see another poker 
hand like the one I wound up wit! 
though,” said Cards Wartson cun- 
ningly. “Instead of watching me, 
they were watching you two turr - 
bling down through the hole in the 
ceiling. First time I ever drew three 
cards to an inside straight flush!”

You've read Poul Anderson stories 
before — but you've never read a 
Poul Anderson story like this one/ 


I 

T hat morning, as he carefully 
shaved his head until it glis- 
tened, Aaron Tozzo pondered a vi- 
sion too unfortunate to be endured.- 
He saw in his mind fifteen convicts 
from Nachbaren Slager, each man 
only one inch high, in a ship the size 
of a child’s balloon. The ship, travel- 
ing at almost the speed of light, con- 
tinued. on forever, with the men 
aboard neither knowing nor caring 
what became of them. 

The worst part of the vision was 
just that in all probability it was 
true. 


He dried his head, rubbed oil into 
his skin, then touched the button 
within his throat. When contact with 
the Bureau switchboard had been 
established, Tozzo said, “I admit we 
can do nothing to get those fifteen 
men back, but at least we can re- 
fuse to send any more.” 

His comment, recorded by the 
switchboard, was passed on to his 
co-workers. They all agreed; he lis- 
tened to their voices chiming in as 
he put on his smock, slippers and 
overcoat. Obviously, the flight had 
been an error; even the public knew 
that now. But — 

“But we’re going on,” Edwin Fer- 


100 





meti, Tozzo’s superior, said above 
the clamor. “We’ve already got the 
volunteers.” 

“Also from Nachbaren Slager?” 
Tozzo asked. Naturally the prisoners 
there would volunteer; their life- 
span at the camp was no more than 
five or six years. And if this flight 
to Proxima were successful, the men 
aboard would obtain their freedom. 
They would not have to return to 
any of the five inhabited planets 
within the Sol System. 

“Where does it matter where they 
originate?” Fermeti said smoothly. 

Tozzo said, “Our effort should be 
directed toward improving the U.S. 
Department of Penology, instead of 
trying to reach other stars.” He had 
a sudden urge to resign his position 
with the Emigration Bureau and go 
into politics as a reform candidate. 

Later, as he sat at the breakfast ta- 
ble, his wife patted him sympathetic- 
ally on the arm. “Aaron, you haven’t 
been able to solve it yet, have you?” 

“No,” he admitted shortly. “And 
now I don’t even care.” He did not 
tell her about the other ship loads 
of convicts which had fruitlessly been 
expended; it was forbidden to dis- 
cuss that with anyone not employed 
by a department of the Government. 

“Could they be re-entering on their 
own?” 

“No. Because mass was lost here, 
in the Sol System. To re-enter they 
have to obtain equal mass back, to 
replace it. That’s the whole point.” 
Exasperated, he sipped his tea and 
ignored her. Women, he thought. At- 
tractive but not bright. “They need 
mass back,” he repeated. “Which 
would be fine if they were making 

102 


a round trip, I suppose. But this is? 
an attempt to colonize; it’s not a 
guided tour that returns to its point 
of origin.” 

“How long does it take them to 
reach Proxima?” Leonore asked. “All 
reduced like that, to an inch high.” 

“About four years.” 

Her eyes grew large. “That’s 
marvelous.” 

Grumbling at her, Tozzo pushed 
his chair back from the table and 
rose. I wish they’d take her, he said 
to himself, since she imagines it’s 
so marvelous. But Leonore would be 
too smart to volunteer. 

Leonore said softly, “Then I was 
right. The Bureau has sent people. 
You as much as admitted it just 
now.” 

Flushing, Tozzo said, “Don’t tell 
anybody; none of your female friends 
especially. Or it’s my job.” He glared 
at her. 

On that hostile note, he set off for 
the Bureau. 

A s Tozzo unlocked his office door, 
Edwin Fermeti hailed him. 
“You think Donald Nils is some- 
where on a planet circling Proxima 
at this very moment?” Nils was a 
notorious murderer who had vol- 
unteered for one of the Bureau’s 
flights. “I wonder — maybe he’s car- 
rying around a lump of sugar five 
times his size.” 

“Not really very funny,” Tozzo 
said. 

Fermeti shrugged. “Just hoping 
to relieve the pessimism. I think 
we’re all getting discouraged.” He 
followed Tozzo into his office. “May- 
be we should volunteer ourselves 

IF 



for the next flight.” It sounded al- 
most as if he meant it, and Tozzo 
glanced quickly at him. “Joke,” Fer- 
meti said. 

“One more flight,” Tozzo said, 
“and if it fails, I resign.” 

“I’ll tell you something,” Fermeti 
said. “We have a new tack.” Now 
Tozzo’s co-worker Craig Gilly had 
come sauntering up. To the two men, 
Fermeti said, “We’re going to try us- 
ing pre-cogs in obtaining our formula 
for re-entry.” His eyes flickered as 
he saw their reaction. 

Astonished, Gilly said, “But all 
the pre-cogs are dead. Destroyed by 
Presidential order twenty years ago.” 

Tozzo, impressed, said, “He’s go- 
ing to dip back into the past to ob- 
tain a pre-cog. Isn’t that right, Fer- 
meti?” 

“We will, yes,” his superior said, 
nodding. “Back to the golden age 
of pre-cognition. The twentieth 
century.” 

For a moment Tozzo was puz- 
zled. And then he remembered. 

During the first half of the twen- 
tieth century so many pre-cogs — 
people with the ability to read the 
future — had come into existence 
that an organized guild had been 
formed with branches in Los An- 
geles, New York, San Francisco and 
Pennsylvania. This group of pre- 
cogs, all knowing one another, had 
put out a number of periodicals 
which had flourished for several dec- 
ades. Boldly and openly, the mem- 
bers of the pre-cog guild had pro- 
claimed in their writings their knowl- 
edge of the future. And yet — as a 
whole, their society had paid littk 
attention to them. 


Tozzo said slowly, “Let me get 
this straight. You mean you’re go- 
ing to make use of the Department of 
Archaeology’s time-dredges to scoop 
up a famous pre-cog of the past?” 
Nodding, Fermeti said, “And bring 
him here to help us, yes.” 

“But how can he help us? He 
would have no knowledge of our fu- 
ture, only of his own.” 

Fermeti said, “The Library of 
Congress has already given us ac- 
cess to its virtually complete collec- 
tion of pre-cog journals of the twen- 
tieth century.” He smiled crookedly 
at Tozzo and Gilly, obviously enjoy- 
ing the situation. “It’s my hope — 
and my expectation — that among this 
great body of writings we will find 
an article specifically dealing with 
our re-entry problem. The chances, 
statistically speaking, are quite good 
. they wrote about innumerable 
topics of future civilization, as you 
know.” 

After a pause, Gilly said, “Very 
clever. I think your idea may solve 
our problem. Speed-of-light travel 
to other star systems may yet become 
a possibility.” 

Sourly, Tozzo said, “Hopefully, 
before we run out of convicts.” But 
he, too, liked his superior’s idea. 
And, in addition, he looked forward 
to seeing face to face one of the 
famous twentieth century pre-cogs. 
Theirs had been one brief, glorious 
period — sadly, long since ended. 

Or not so brief, if one dated it as 
starting with Jonathan Swift, rather 
than with H. G. Wells. Swift had 
written of the two moons of Mars 
and their unusual orbital character- 
istics years before telescopes had 


WATERSPIDER 


103 



proved their existence. And so to- 
day there was a tendency in the text- 
books to include him. 

II 

I t took the computers at the Li- 
brary of Congress only a short 
while to scan the brittle, yellowed 
volumes, article by article, and to se- 
lect the sole contribution dealing with 
deprivation of mass and restoration 
as the modus operandi of interstel- 
lar space travel. Einstein’s formula 
that as an object increased its veloc- 
ity its mass increased proportion- 
ally had been so fully accepted, so 
completely unquestioned, that no one 
in the twentieth century had paid any 
attention to the particular article, 
which had been put in print in Au- 
gust of 1955 in a pre-cog journal 
called If. 

In Fermeti’s office, Tozzo sat be- 
side his superior as the two of them 
pored over the photographic repro- 
duction of the journal. The article 
was titled Night Flight, and it ran 
only a few thousand words. Both 
men read it avidly, neither speaking 
until they had finished. 

“Well?” Fermeti said, when they 
had come to the end. 

Tozzo said, “No doubt of it. 
That’s our Project, all right. A lot 
is garbled; for instance he calls the 
Emigration Bureau ‘Outward, In- 
corporated,’ and believes it to be a 
private commercial firm.” He re- 
ferred to the text. “It’s really un- 
canny, though. You’re obviously this 
character, Edmond Fletcher; the 
names are similar but still a little off, 
as is everything else. And I’m Alison 


Torelli.” He shook his head admir- 
ingly. “Those pre-cogs . having a 
mental image of the future that was 
always askew and yet in the main — n 
“In the main correct,” Fermeti 
finished. “Yes, I agree. This Night 
Flight article definitely deals with 
us and the Bureau’s Project . here- 
in called Waterspider, because it has 
to be done in one great leap. Good 
lord, that would have been a per- 
fect name, had we thought of it. 
Maybe we can still call it that.” 
Tozzo said slowly, “But the pre- 
cog who wrote Night Flight ... in 
no place does he actually give the 
formula for mass-restoration or even 
for mass-deprivation. He just simply 
says that ‘we have it.’ ” Taking the 
reproduction of the journal, he read 
aloud from the article: 

Difficulty in restoring mass to 
the ship and its passengers at the 
termination of the flight had 
proved a stumbling block for 
Torelli and his team of research- 
ers and yet they had at last 
proved successful. After the 
fateful implosion of the Sea 
Scout, the initial ship to — 

“And that’s all,” Tozzo said. “So 
what good does it do us? Yes, this 
pre-cog experienced our present sit- 
uation a hundred years ago — but he 
left out the technical details ” 

There was silence. 

At last Fermeti said thoughtfully, 
“That doesn’t mean he didn’t know 
the technical data. We know today 
that the others in his guild were very 
often trained scientists.” He exam- 
ined the biographical report. “Yes, 


104 


IF 



while not actually using his pre-cog 
ability he worked as a chicken-fat 
analyst for the University of Cali- 
fornia.” 

“Do you still intend to use the 
time-dredge to bring him up to 
the present?” 

Fermeti nodded. “I only wish the 
dredge worked both ways. If it 
could be used with the future, not 
..the past, we could avoid having to 
jeopardize the safety of this pre- 
cog — ” He glanced down at the arti- 
cle. “This Poul Anderson.” 

Chilled, Tozzo said, “What hazard 
is there?” 

“We may not be able to return 
him to his own time. Or — ” Fermeti 
paused. “We might lose part of him 
along the way, wind up with only 
half of him. The dredge has bisected 
many objects before.” 

“And this man isn’t a convict at 
Nachbaren Slager,” Tozzo said. “So 
you don’t have that rationale to fall 
back on.” 

Fermeti said suddenly, “We’ll do it 
properly. We’ll reduce the jeopardy 
by sending a team of men back to 
that time, back to 1954. They can 
apprehend this Poul Anderson and 
see that all of him gets into the 
time-dredge, not merely the top half 
or the left side.” 

So it had been decided. The De- 
partment of Archaeology’s time- 
dredge would go back to the world 
of 1954 and pick up the pre-cog 
Poul Anderson; there was nothing 
further to discuss. 

R esearch conducted by the U. S. 

Department of Archaeology 
showed that in September of 1954 


Poul Anderson had been living hi 
Berkeley, California, on Grove Street. 
In that month he had attended a 
top-level meeting of pre-cogs from 
all over the United States at the Sir 
Francis Drake Hotel in San Fran- 
cisco. It was probable that there, 
in that meeting, basic policy for 
the next year had been worked out, 
with Anderson, and other experts, 
participating. 

“It’s really very simple,” Fermeti 
explained to Tozzo and Gilly. “A 
pair of men will go back. They will 
be provided with forged identifica- 
tion showing them to be part of 
the nation-wide pre-cog organiza- 
tion . squares of cellophane-en- 
closed paper which are pinned to 
the coat lapel. Naturally, they will 
be wearing twentieth century gar- 
ments. They will locate Poul An- 
derson, single him out and draw 
him off to one side.” 

“And tell him what?” Tozzo said 
skeptically. 

“That they represent an unlicensed 
amateur pre-cog organization in 
Battlecreek, Michigan, and that they 
have constructed an amusing ve- 
hicle built to resemble a time-travel 
dredge of the future. They will ask 
Mr. Anderson, who was actually 
quite famous in his time, to pose by 
their humbug dredge, and then they 
will ask for a shot of him within. 
Our research shows that according to 
his contemporaries, Anderson was 
mild and easy-going and also that at 
these yearly top-strategy assemblies 
he often became convivial enough to 
enter into the mood of optimism 
generated by his fellow pre-cogs.” 

Tozzo said, “You mean he sniffed 


WATERSPIDER 


105 



what they called ‘airplane dope?* 
He was a ‘glue-sniffer?* ” 

With a faint smile, Fermeti said, 
“Hardly. That was a mania among 
adolescents and did not become 
widespread in fact until a decade 
later. No, I am speaking about im- 
bibing alcohol.” 

“I see,” Tozzo said, nodding. 
Fermeti continued, “In the area 
of difficulties, we must cope with the 
fact that at this top-secret session, 
Anderson brought along his wife 
Karen, dressed as a Maid of Venus 
in gleaming breast-cups, short skirt 
and helmet, and that he also brought 
their new-born daughter Astrid. An- 
derson himself did not wear any dis- 
guise for purposes of concealing his 
identity. He had no anxieties, being a 
quite stable person, as were most 
twentieth century pre-cogs. 

“However, during the discussion 
periods between formal sessions, the 
pre-cogs, minus their wives, circu- 
lating about, playing poker and ar- 
guing, some of them it is said ston- 
ing one another — ” 

“Stoning?” 

“Or, as it was put, becoming 
stoned. In any case, they gathered 
in small groups in the antechambers 
of the hotel, and it is at such an oc- 
casion that we expect to nab him. 
In the general hubbub his disap- 
pearance would not be noted. We 
would expect to return him to that 
exact time, or at least no more than 
a few hours later or earlier . pref- 
erably not earlier because two Poul 
Andersons at the meeting might 
prove awkward.** 

Tozzo, impressed, said, “Sounds 
foolproof.** 


“I’m glad you like it,” Fermeti said 
tartly, “because you will be one of 
the team sent.** 

Pleased, Tozzo said, “Then I had 
better get started learning the de- 
tails of life in the mid twentieth cen- 
tury.** He picked up another issue 
of If. This one, May of 1971, had 
interested him as soon as he had 
seen it. Of course, this issue would 
not be known yet to the people of 
1954 . but eventually they would 
see it. And once having seen it 
they would never forget it . 

Ray Bradbury’s first textbook to be 
serialized, he realized as he examined 
the journal. The Fisher of Men , it 
was called, and in it the great Los 
Angeles pre-cog had anticipated the 
ghastly Gutmanist political revolu- 
tion which was to sweep the inner 
planets. Bradbury had warned 
against Gutman, but the warning 
had gone — of course — unheeded. 
Now Gutman was dead and the fa- 
natical supporters had dwindled to 
the status of random terrorists. But 
had the world listened to Bradbury — 
“Why the frown?** Fermeti asked 
him. “Don’t you want to go?” 
“Yes,** Tozzo said thoughtfully. 
“But it’s a terrible responsibility. 
These are no ordinary men.** 

“That is certainly the truth,’* Fer- 
meti said, nodding. 

Ill 

T wenty-four hours later, Aaron 
Tozzo stood surveying himself 
in his mid twentieth century clothing 
and wondering if Anderson would 
be deceived, if he actually could be 
duped into entering the dredge.

The costume certainly was perfec- 
tion itself. Tozzo had even been 
equipped with the customary waist- 
length beard and handlebar mus- 
tache so 'popular circa 1950 in the 
United States. And he wore a wig. 

Wigs, as everyone knew, had at 
that time swept the United States as 
the fashion note par excellence; men 
and women both had worn huge pow- 
dered perukes of bright colors, reds 
and greens and blues and of course 
dignified grays. It was one of the 
most amusing occurrences of the 
twentieth century. 

Tozzo’s wig, a bright red, pleased 
him. Authentic, it had come from 
the Los Angeles Museum of Cultural 
History, and the curator had vouch- 
ed for it being a man’s, not a wom- 
an’s. So the fewest possible chances 
of detection were being taken. Little 
risk existed that they would be de- 
tected as members of another, fu- 
ture culture entirely. 

And yet Tozzo was still uneasy. 

However, the plan had been ar- 
ranged; now it was time to go. With 
Gilly, the other member selected, 
Tozzo entered the time-dredge and 
seated himself at the controls. The 
Department of Archaeology had pro- 
vided a full instruction manual, 
which lay open before him. As soon 
as Gilly had locked the hatch, Tozzo 
took the bull by the horns (a twen- 
tieth century expression) and started 
up the dredge. 

Dials registered. They were spin- 
ning backward into time, back to 
1954 and the San Francisco Pre- 
cog Congress. 

Beside him, Gilly practiced mid 
twentieth century phrases from a ref- 


erence volume. “Diz muz be da 
blace ...” Gilly cleared his throat. 
“Kilroy was here,” he murmured. 
“Wha* hoppen? Like man, let’s cut 
out; this ball’s a drag.” He shook his 
"head. “I can’t grasp the exact sense 
of these phrases,” he apologized to 
Tozzo. “Twenty-three skidoo.” 

Now a red light glowed; the dredge 
was about to conclude its journey. 
A moment later its turbines halted. 

They had come to rest on the 
sidewalk outside the Sir Francis 
Drake Hotel in downtown San Fran- 
cisco. 

On all sides, people in quaint 
archaic costumes dragged along on 
foot. And, Tozzo saw, there were no 
monorails; all the visible traffic was 
surface-bound. What a congestion, 
he thought, as he watched the auto- 
mobiles and buses moving inch by 
inch along the packed streets. An 
official in blue waved traffic ahead 
as best he could, but the entire en- 
terprise, Tozzo could see, was an 
abysmal failure. 

“Time for phase two,” Gilly said. 
But he, too, was gaping at the stalled 
surface vehicles. “Good grief,” he 
said, “look at the incredibly short 
skirts of the women; why, the knees 
are virtually exposed. Why don’t the 
women die of whisk virus?” 

“I don’t know,” Tozzo said, “but 
I do know we’ve got to get into the 
Sir Francis Drake Hotel.” 

Carefully, they opened the port 
of the time-dredge and stepped out. 
And then Tozzo realized something. 
There had been an -error. Already. 

The men of this decade were clean- 
shaven. 

“Gilly,” he said rapidly, “we’ve 


WATERSPIDER 


107 



got to shed our beards and mus- 
taches.” In an instant he had pulled 
Gilly’s off, leaving his bare face 
exposed. But the wig; that was cor- 
rect. All the men visible wore head- 
dress of some type; Tozzo saw few 
if any bald men. The women, too 
had luxurious wigs ... or were they 
wigs? Could they perhaps be natural 
hair? 

In any case, both he and Gilly now 
would pass. Into the Sir Francis 
Drake, he said to himself, leading 
Gilly along. 

T hey darted lithely across the side- 
walk — it was amazing how 
slowly the people of this time-period 
walked — and into the inexpressibly 
old-fashioned lobby of the hotel. 
Like a museum, Tozzo thought as he 
glanced about him. I wish we could 
linger . but they could not. 

“How’s our identification?” Gilly 
said nervously. “Is it passing inspec- 
tion?” The business with the face- 
hair had upset him. 

On each of their lapels they car- 
ried the expertly made false identi- 
fication. It worked. Presently they 
found themselves ascending by a 
lift, or rather elevator, to the cor- 
rect floor. 

The elevator let them off in a 
crowded foyer. Men, all clean-shav- 
en, with wigs or natural hair, stood 
in small clusters everywhere, laugh- 
ing and talking. And a number of at- 
tractive women, some of them in gar- 
ments called leotards, which were 
skin-tight, loitered about smilingly. 
Even though the styles of the times 
required their breasts to be covered, 
they were a sight to see. 


Sotto voce, Gilly said, “I am 
stunned. In this room are some of 
the—” 

“I know,” Tozzo murmured. Their 
Project could wait, at least a little 
while. Here was an unbelievably 
golden opportunity to see these pre- 
cogs, actually to talk to them and 
listen to them . 

Here came a tall, handsome man 
in a dark suit that sparkled with tiny 
specks of some unnatural material, 
some variety of synthetic. The man 
wore glasses and his hair, everything 
about him, had a tanned, dark look. 
The name on his identification . 
Tozzo peered. 

The tall, good-looking man was A. 
E. Van Vogt. 

“Say,” another individual, perhaps 
a pre-cog enthusiast, was saying to 
Van Vogt, stopping him. “I read 
both versions of your World of Null 
A and I still didn’t quite get that 
about it being him; you know, at 
the end. Could you explain that part 
to me? And also when they started 
into the tree and then just — ” 

Van Vogt halted. A soft smile ap- 
peared on his face and he said, 
“Well, I’ll tell you a secret. I start 
out with a plot and then the plot 
sort of folds up. So then I have to 
have another plot to finish the rest 
of the story.” 

Going over to listen, Tozzo felt 
something magnetic about Van Vogt. 
He was so tall, so spiritual. Yes, Toz- 
zo said to himself; that was the word, 
a healing spirituality. There was a 
quality of innate goodness which em- 
anated from him. 

All at once Van Vogt said, “There 
goes a man with my pants.” And, 


108 


IF 



without a further word to die en- 
thusiast, stalked off and disappear- 
ed into the crowd. 

Tozzo’s head swam. To actually 
have seen and heard A. E. Van 
Vogt— 

“Look,” Gilly was saying, pluck- 
ing at his sleeve. “That enormous, 
genial-looking man seated over there; 
that’s Howard Browne, who edited 
the pre-cog journal Amazing at this 
time-period.” 

“I have to catch a plane,” How- 
ard Browne was saying to anyone 
who would listen to him. He glanced 
about him in worried anxiety, de- 
spite his almost physical geniality. 

“I wonder,” Gilly said, “if Doctor 
Asimov is here.” 

'll[7’e can ask, Tozzo decided. He 
* * made his way over to one of 
the young women wearing a blonde 
wig and green leotards. “WHERE IS 
DOCTOR ASIMOV?” he asked 
clearly in the argot of the times. 

“Who’s to know?” the girl said. 

“Is he here, miss?” 

“Naw,” the girl said. 

Gilly again plucked at Tozzo’s 
sleeve. “We must find Poul Ander- 
son, remember? Enjoyable as it is to 
talk to this girl — ” 

“I’m inquiring about Asimov,” 
Tozzo said brusquely. After all, Isaac 
Asimov had been founder of the en- 
tire twenty-first century positronic ro- 
bot industry. How could he not be 
here? 

A burly outdoorish man strode by 
them, and Tozzo saw that this was 
Jack Vance. Vance, he decided, 
looked more like a big game hunter 
than anything else ... we must be- 


ware of him, Tozzo decided. If we 
got into any altercation Vance could 
take care of us easily. 

He noticed now that Gilly was 
talking to the blonde-wigged girl 
in the green leotards. “MURRAY 
LEINSTER?” Gilly was asking. “The 
man whose paper on parallel time is 
still at the very forefront of theoret- 
ical studies; isn’t he — ” 

“I dunno,” the girl said, in a 
bored tone of voice. 

A group had gathered about a fig- 
ure opposite them; the cen- 
tral person whom everybody was 
listening to was saying, “ . all 
right, if like Howard Browne you 
prefer air travel, fine. But I say 
it’s risky. I don’t fly. In fact even 
riding in a car is dangerous. I gen- 
erally lie down in the back.” The 
man wore a short-cropped wig and a 
bow tie; he had a round, pleasant 
face but his eyes were intense. 

It was Ray Bradbury, and Tozzo 
started toward him at once. 

“Stop!” Gilly whispered angrily. 
“Remember what we came for.” 

And, past Bradbury, seated at the 
bar, Tozzo saw an older, care-weath- 
ered man in a brown suit wearing 
small glasses and sipping a drink. 
He recognized the man from draw- 
ings in early Gernsback publica- 
tions; it was the fabulously unique 
pre-cog from the New Mexico re- 
gion, Jack Williamson. 

“I thought Legion of Time was the 
finest novel-length science-fiction 
work I ever read,” an individual, evi- 
dently another pre-cog enthusiast, 
was saying to Jack Williamson, and 
Williamson was nodding in pleasure. 
“That was originally going to be 


WATERSPIDER 


109 



a short story,” Williamson said. “But 
it grew. Yes, I liked that one, too.” 
Meanwhile Gilly had wandered 
on, into an adjoining room. He 
found at a tabic, two women and a 
man in deep conversation. One of the 
women, dark-haired and handsome, 
with bare shoulders, was — according 
to her identification plate — Evelyn 
Paige. The taller women he discov- 
ered was the renowned Margaret St. 
Clair, and Gilly at once said: 

“Mrs. St. Clair, your article en- 
titled The Scarlet Hexapod in the 
September 1959 If was one of the 
finest — ” And then he broke off. 

Because Margaret St. Clair had 
not written that yet. Knew in fact 
nothing about it. Flushing with ner- 
vousness, Gilly backed away. 

“Sorry,” he murmured. “Excuse 
me; I became confused.” 

Raising an eyebrow, Margaret St. 
Clair said, “In the September 1959 
issue, you say? What are you, a man 
from the future?” 

“Droll,” Evelyn Paige said, “but 
let’s continue.” She gave Gilly a 
hard stare from her black eyes. “Now 
Bob, as I understand what you’re 
saying — ” She addressed the man 
opposite her, and Gilly saw now to 
his delight that the dire-looking 
cadaverous individual was none other 
than Robert Bloch. 

Gilly said, “Mr. Bloch, your ar- 
ticle in Galaxy : Sabbatical , was — ” 
“You’ve got the wrong person, my 
friend,” Robert Bloch said. “I never 
wrote any piece entitled Sabbatical” 
Good lord, Gilly realized. I did it 
again; Sabbatical is another work 
which has not been written yet. I 
had better get away from here. 


He moved back toward Tozzo 
. and found him standing rigidly. 

Tozzo said, “I’ve found Ander- 
son.” 

At once, Gilly turned, also rigid. 

B oth of them had carefully studied 
the pictures provided by the 
Library of Congress. There stood the 
famous pre-cog, tall and slender and 
straight, even a trifle thin, with curly 
hair — or wig — and glasses, a warm 
glint of friendliness in his eyes. He 
held a whiskey glass in one hand, 
and he was discoursing with several 
other pre-cogs. Obviously he was en- 
joying himself. 

“Um, uhh, let’s see,” Anderson 
was saying, as Tozzo and' Gilly 
came quietly up to join the group. 
“Pardon?” Anderson cupped his ear 
to catch what one of the other pre- 
cogs was saying. “Oh, uh, yup, that’s 
right.” Anderson nodded. “Yup, 
Tony, uh, I agree with you one 
hundred per cent.” 

The other pre-cog, Tozzo realized, 
was the superb Tony Boucher, whose 
pre-cognition of the religious revival 
of the next century had been almost 
supernatural. The word-by-word de- 
scription of the Miracle in the Cave 
involving the robot . Tozzo gazed 
at Boucher with awe, and then he 
turned back to Anderson. 

“Poul,” another pre-cog said. “I’ll 
tell you how the Italians intended 
to get the British to leave if they 
did invade in 1943. The British 
would stay at hotels, the best, nat- 
urally. The Italians would over- 
charge them.” 

”Oh, yes, yes,” Anderson said, 
nodding and smiling, his eyes twink- 


no 


IF 








Kng. “And the British, being gen- 
tlemen, would say nothing — ” 

“But they’d leave the next day,” 
the other pre-cog finished, and all 
in the group laughed, except for 
Gilly and Tozzo. 

“Mr. Anderson,” Tozzo said 
tensely, “we’re from an amateur 
pre-cog organization at Battlecreek, 
Michigan and we would like to 
photograph you beside our model 
of a time-dredge.” 

“Pardon?” Anderson said, cup- 
ping his ear. 

Tozzo repeated what he had said, 
trying to be audible above the back- 
ground racket. At last Anderson 
seemed to understand. 

“Oh, um, well, where is it?” An- 
derson asked obligingly. 

“Downstairs on the sidewalk,” 
Gilly said. “It was too heavy to 
bring up.” 

“Well, uh, if it won’t take too aw- 
fully long,” Anderson said, “which 
I doubt it will.” He excused himself 
from the group and followed after 
them as they started toward the 
elevator. 

“It’s steam-engine building time,” 
a heavy-set man called to them as 
they passed. “Time to build steam 
engines, Poul.” 

“We’re going downstairs,” Tozzo 
said nervously. 

“Walk downstairs on your heads,” 
the pre-cog said. He waved good- 
by goodnaturedly, as the elevatpr 
came and the three of them entered 
it. 

“Kris is jolly today,” Anderson 
said. 

“And how,” Gilly said, using one 
of his phrases. 


“Is Bob Heinlem here?” Ander- 
son asked Tozzo as they descended. 
“I understand he and Mildred Cling- 
erman went off somewhere to talk 
about cats and nobody has seen them 
come back.” 

“That’s the way the ball bounces,” 
Gilly said, trying out another twentU 
eth century phrase. 

Anderson cupped his ear, smiled 
hesitantly, but said nothing. 

At last, they emerged on the side- 
walk. At the sight of their time- 
dredge, Anderson blinked in aston- 
ishment. 

“I’ll be gosh darned,” he said, ap- 
proaching it. “That’s certainly im- 
posing. Sure, I’d, uh, be happy to 
pose beside it.” He drew his lean, 
angular body erect, smiling that 
warm, almost tender smile that Tozzo 
had noticed before. “Uh, how’s this?” 
Anderson inquired, a little timidly. 

With an authentic twentieth cen- 
tury camera taken from the Smith- 
sonian, Gilly snapped a picture. 
“Now inside,” he requested, and 
glanced at Tozzo. 

“Why, uh, certainly,” Poul Ander- 
son said, and stepped up the stairs and 
into the dredge. “Gosh, Karen would, 
uh, like this,” he said as he disap- 
peared inside. “I wish to heck she’d 
come along.” 

Tozzo followed swiftly. Gilly slam- 
med the hatch shut, and, at the con- 
trol board, Tozzo with the instruc- 
tion manual in hand punched but- 
tons. 

The turbines hummed, but An- 
derson did not seem to hear them; 
he was engrossed in staring at the 
controls, his eyes wide. 

“Gosh,” he said. 


112 


IF 



The time-dredge passed back to 
the present, with Anderson still lost 
in his scrutiny of the controls. 

IV 

F ermeti met them. “Mr. Ander- 
son/’ he said, “this is an in- 
credible honor.” He held out his 
hand, but now Anderson was peer- 
ing through the open hatch past 
him, at the city beyond; he did not 
notice the offered hand. 

“Say,” Anderson said, his face 
twitching. “Um, what’s, uh, this?” 
He was staring at the monorail 
system primarily, Tozzo decided. 
And this was odd, because at least 
in Seattle there had been monorails 
back in Anderson’s time ... or had 
there been? Had that come later? In 
any case, Anderson now wore a mas- 
sively perplexed expression. 

“Individual cars,” Tozzo said, 
standing close beside him. “Your 
monorails had only group cars. La- 
ter on, after your time, it was made 
possible for each citizen’s house to 
have a monorail outlet; the individual 
brought his car out of its garage and 
onto the rail-terminal, from which 
point he joined the collective struc- 
ture. Do you see?” 

But Anderson remained perplexed; 
his expression in fact had deepened. 

“Um,” he said, “what do you 
mean ‘my time’? Am I dead?” He 
looked morose now. “I thought it 
would be more along the lines of 
Valhalla, with Vikings and such. Not 
futuristic.” 

“You’re not dead, Mr. Ander- 
son,” Fermeti said. “What you’re 
facing is the culture-syndrome of the 


mid twenty-first century. I must tell 
you, sir, that you’ve been napped. 
But you will be returned; I give you 
both my personal and official word.” 
Anderson’s jaw dropped, but he 
said nothing; he continued to stare. 

D onald Nils, notorious murderer, 
sat at the single table in the 
reference room of the Emigration 
Bureau’s interstellar speed-of-light 
ship and computed that he was, in 
Earth figures, an inch high: Bitterly, 
he cursed. “It’s cruel and unusual 
punishment,” he grated aloud. “It’s 
against the Constitution.” And then 
he remembered that he had volun- 
teered, in order to get out of Nach- 
baren Slager. That goddam hole, 
he said to himself. Anyhow, I’m out 
of there. 

And, he said to himself, even if 
I’m only an inch high I’ve still made 
myself captain of this lousy ship, 
and if it ever gets to Proxima I’ll 
be captain of the entire lousy Prox- 
ima System. I didn’t study with Gut- 
man himself for nothing. And if 
that don’t beat Nachbaren Slager, 
I don’t know what does . 

His second-in-command, Pete 
Bailly, stuck his head into the ref- 
erence room. “Hey, Nils, I have been 
looking over the micro-repro of this 
particular old pre-cog journal 
Astounding like you told me, this 
Venus Equilateral article about mat- 
ter transmission, and I mean even 
though I was the top vid repairman 
in New York City that don’t mean 
I can build one of these things.” He 
glared at Nils. “That’s asking a lot.” 
Nils said tightly, “We’ve got to 
get back to Earth.” 


WATBRSPIDER 


lit 



“You’re out of luck,” Bailly told 
him. “Better settle for Prox.” 

Furiously, Nils swept the micro- 
reproductions from the table, onto 
the floor of the ship. “That damn 
Bureau of Emigration! They tricked 
us!” 

Bailly shrugged. “Anyhow we got 
plenty to eat and a good reference 
library and 3-D movies every night.” 

“By the time we get to Prox,” 
Nils snarled, “we’ll have seen every 
movie — ” He calculated. “Two thou- 
sand times.” 

“Well, then don’t watch. Or we 
can run them backwards. How’s 
your research coming?” 

“I got going the micro of an ar- 
ticle in Space Science Fiction ” Nils 
said thoughtfully, “called The Vari- 
able Man . It tells about faster-than- 
light transmission. You disappear 
and then reappear. Some guy named 
Cole is going to perfect it, according 
to the old-time pre-cog who wrote 
it.” He brooded about that. “If we 
could build a faster-than-light ship 
we could return to Earth. We could 
take over.” 

“That’s crazy talk,” Bailly said. 

Nils regarded him. “I’m in com- 
mand.” 

“Then,” Bailly said, “we got a 
nut in command. There’s no return- 
ing to Terra; we better build our 
lives on Proxima’s planets and for- 
get forever about our home. Thank 
God we got women aboard. My God, 
even if we did get back . what 
could one-inch high people accom- 
plish? We’d be jeered at.” 

“Nobody jeers at me,” Nils said 
quiedy. 

But he knew Eailly was right. 


They’d be lucky if they could re* 
search the micros of the old pre-cog 
journals in the ship’s reference room 
and develop for themselves a way of 
landing safely on Proxima’s planets 
. even that was asking a lot. 

We’ll succeed, Nils said to him- 
self. As long as everyone obeys me, 
does exactly as I tell them, with 
no dumb questions. 

Bending, he activated the spool 
of the December 1962 //. There 
was an article in it that particularly 
interested him . and he had four 
years ahead of him in which to read, 
understand, and finally apply it. 

F ermeti said, “Surely your pre-cog 
ability helped prepare you for 
this, Mr. Anderson.” His voice fal- 
tereded with nervous strain, despite 
his efforts to control it. 

“How about taking me back 
now?” Anderson said. He sounded 
almost calm. 

Fermeti, after shooting a swift 
glance at Tozzo and Gilly, said to 
Anderson, “We have . a technical 
problem, you see. That’s why we 
brought here to our own time-con- 
tinuum. You see — ” 

“I think you had better, um, take 
me back,” Anderson broke in. “Kar- 
en’ll get worried.” He craned his 
neck, peering in all directions. “I 
knew it would be somewhat on this 
order,” he murmured. His face 
twitched. “Not too different from 
what I expected . what’s that tall 
thing over there? Looks like what 
the old blimps used to catch onto.” 
“That.” Tozzo said, “is a prayer 
tower.” 

“Our problem,” Fermeti said pa-

tiently, “is dealt with in your article 
Night Flight in the August 1955 
If. We’ve been able to deprive an 
interstellar vehicle of its mass, but 
so far restoration of mass has — ” 

“Uh, oh, yes,” Anderson said, in 
a preoccupied way. “I’m working on 
that yarn right now. Should have 
that off to Scott in another couple of 
weeks.” He explained, “My agent.” 

Fermeti considered a moment and 
then said, “Can you give us the for- 
mula for mass-restoration, Mr. An- 
derson?” 

“Um,” Poul Anderson said slow- 
ly, “Yes, I guess that would be the 
correct term. Mass-restoration . 
I could go along with that.” He nod- 
ded. “I haven’t worked out any for- 
mula; I didn’t want to make the yam 
too technical. I guess I could make 
one up, if that’s what they wanted.” 
He was silent, then, apparently hav- 
ing withdrawn into a world of his 
own; the three men waited, but An- 
derson said nothing more. 

“Your pre-cog ability,” Fermeti 
said. 

“Pardon?” Anderson said, cupping 
his ear. “Pre-cog?” He smiled shyly. 
“Oh, uh, I wouldn’t go so far as to 
say that. I know John believes in all 
that, but I can’t say as I consider 
a few experiments at Duke Univer- 
sity as proof.” 

Fermeti stared at Anderson a long 
time. “Take the first article in the 
January 1953 Galaxy” he said 
quietly. “The Defenders . about 
the people living, beneath the sur- 
face and the robots up above, pre- 
tending to fight the war but actually 
not, actually faking the reports so 
interestingly that the people — ” 


“I read that,” Poul Anderson 
agreed. “Very good, I thought, ex- 
cept for the ending. I didn’t care 
too much for the ending. 

Fermeti said, “You understand, 
don’t you, that those exact condi- 
tions came to pass in 1996, during 
World War Three? That by means of 
the article we were able to penetrate 
the deception carried on by our sur- 
face robots? That virtually every 
word of that article was exactly pro- 
phetic — ” 

“Phil Dick wrote that,” Anderson 
said. “ The Defenders .” 

“Do you know him?” Tozzo in- 
quired. 

“Met him yesterday at the Con- 
vention,” Anderson said. “For the 
first time. Very nervous fellow, was 
almost afraid to come in.” 

Fermeti said, “Am I to under- 
stand that none of you are aware 
that you are pre-cogs?” His voice 
shook, completely out of control 
now. 

ii'VJSTell,” Anderson said slowly, 
" * “some sf writers believe in 
it. I think Alf Van Vogt does.” He 
smiled at Fermeti. 

“But don’t you understand?” Fer- 
meti demanded. “You described us 
in an article — you accurately de- 
scribed our Bureau and its interstel- 
lar Project!” 

After a pause, Anderson mur- 
mured, “Gosh, I’ll be darned. No, I 
didn’t know that. Um, thanks a lot 
for telling me.” 

Turning to Tozzo, Fermeti said, 
“Obviously we’ll have to. recast our 
entire concept of the mid twentieth 
century.” He looked weary.

Tozzc said, ‘Tor our purposes 
their ignorance doesn’t matter. Be- 
cause the pre-cognitive ability was 
there anyhow, whether they recog- 
nized it or not.” That, to him, was 
perfectly clear. 

Anderson, meanwhile, had wan- 
dered off a little and stood now in- 
specting the display window of a 
nearby gift store. “Interesting bric- 
a-brac in there. I ought to pick up 
something for Karen while I’m here. 
Would it be all right — ” He turned 
questioningly to Fermeti. “Could I 
step in there for a moment and look 
around?” 

“Yes, yes,” Fermeti said irritably. 

Poul Anderson disappeared inside 
the gift shop, leaving the three of 
them to argue the meaning of their 
discovery. 

“What we’ve got tc do,” Fermeti 
said, “is sit him down in the situa- 
tion familiar to him: before a type- 
writer. We must persuade him to 
compose an article on deprivation of 
mass and its subsequent restoration. 
Whether he himself takes the article 
to be factual or not has no bearing; 
it still will be. The Smithsonian must 
have a workable twentieth century 
typewriter and 8% by 11 white sheets 
of paper. Do you agree?” 

Tozzo, meditating, said, “I’ll tell 
you what I think. It was a cardinal 
error to permit him to go into that 
gift shop.” 

“Why is that?” Fermeti inquired. 

“I see his point,” Gilly said ex- 
citedly. “We’ll never see Anderson 
again; he’s skipped out on us through 
the pretext of gift-shopping for his 
wife.” 

Ashen-faced, Fermeti turned and

raced into the gift shop. Tozzo and 
Gilly followed. 

The store was empty. Anderson 
had eluded them; he was gone. 

A s he loped silently out the back 
door of the gift shop, Poul An- 
derson thought to himself, I don’t 
believe they’ll get me. At least not 
right away. 

I’ve got too much to do while 
I’m here, he realized. What an op- 
portunity! When I’m an old man I 
can tell Astrid’s children about this. 

Thinking of his daughter Astrid 
reminded him of one very simple 
fact, however. Eventually he had to 
go back to 1954. Because of Karen 
and the baby. No matter what he 
found here — for him it was tem- 
porary. 

But meanwhile . first I’ll go to 
the library, any library, he decided. 
And get a good look at history books 
that’ll tell me what took place in 
the intervening years between 1954 
and now. 

I’d like to know, he said to himself, 
about the Cold War, how the U. S. 
and Russia come out. And — space 
explorations. I’ll bet they put a man 
on Luna by 1975. Certainly, they’re 
exploring space now; heck, they 
even have a time-dredge so they must 
have that. 

Ahead Poul Anderson saw a door- 
way. It was open and without hes- 
itation he plunged into it. Another 
shop of some kind, but this one 
larger than the gift shop. 

“Yes sir,” a voice said, and a 
bald-headed man — they all seemed 
to be bald-headed here — approach- 
ed him. The man glanced at An- 

IF 



derson’s hair, his clothes . how- 
ever the clerk was polite; he made 
no comment. “May I help you?” he 
asked. 

“Urn,” Anderson said, stalling. 
What did this place sell, anyhow? 
He glanced around. Gleaming elec- 
tronic objects of some sort. But what 
did they do? 

The clerk said, “Haven’t you been 
nuzzled lately, sir?” 

“What’s that?” Anderson said. 
Nuzzled? 

“The new spring nuzzlers have 
arrived, you know,” the clerk said, 
moving toward the gleaming spheri- 
cal machine nearest him. “Yes,” he 
said to Poul, “you do strike me as 
very, very faintly introve — no 
offense meant, sir, I mean, 
it’s legal to be introved.” The 
clerk chuckled. “For instance, your 
rather odd clothing . made it your- 
self, I take it? I must say, sir, to make 
your own clothing is highly introve. 
Did you weave it?” The clerk grim- 
aced as if tasting something bad. 

“No,” Poul said, “as a matter of 
fact it’s my best suit.” 

“Heh, heh,” the clerk said. ‘I share 
the joke, sir; quite witty. But what 
about your head? You haven't shaved 
your head in weeks” 

“Nope,” Anderson admitted. 
“Well, maybe I do need a nuzzler.” 
Evidently everyone in this century 
had one; like a TV set in his own 
time, it was a necessity, in order for 
one to be part of the culture. 

“How many in your family?” the 
clerk said. Bringing out a measuring 
tape, he measured the length of 
Poul’s sleeve. 

“Three,” Poul answered, baffled. 


“How old is the youngest?” 

“Just born,” Poul said. 

The clerk’s face lost all its color. 
“Get out of here,” he said quietly. 
“Before I call for the polpol/” 
“Um, what’s that? Pardon?” Poul 
said, cupping his ear and trying to 
hear, not certain he had under- 
stood. 

“You’re a criminal,” the clerk 
mumbled. “You ought to be in Nach- 
baren Slager.” 

“Well, thanks anyhow,” Poul said, 
and backed out of the store, onto 
the sidewalk; his last glimpse was of 
the clerk still staring at him. 

U A re you a foreigner?” a voice 
f* asked, a woman’s voice. At 
the curb she had halted her vehicle. 
It looked to Poul like a bed; in fact, 
he realized, it was a bed. The wom- 
an regarded him with astute calm, 
her eyes dark and intense. Although 
her glistening shaved head somewhat 
upset him, he could see that she was 
attractive. 

“I’m from another culture,” Poul 
said, finding himself unable to keep 
his eyes from her figure. Did all 
the women dress like this here in 
this society? Bare shoulders, he could 
understand. But not — 

And the bed. The combination of 
the two was too much for him. What 
kind of business was she in, any- 
how? And in public. What a society 
this was . morals had changed 
since his own time. 

“I’m looking for the library,” 
Poul said, not coming too close to 
the vehicle which was a bed with 
motor and wheels, a tiller for steer- 
ing. 


WATERSPIDER

The woman said, “The library is 
one bight from here.” 

“Um,” Poul said, “what’s a 
‘bight?’ ” 

“Obviously, you’re wanging me,” 
the woman said. All visible parts of 
her flushed a dark red. “It’s not fun- 
ny. Any more than your disgustingly 
hairy head is. Really, both your 
wanging and your head are not amus- 
ing, at least not to me.” And yet she 
did not go on; she remained where 
she was, regarding him somberly. 
“Perhaps you need help,” she de- 
cided. “Perhaps I should pity you. 
You know of course that the pol- 
pol could pick you up any time they 
want.” 

Poul said, “Could I, um, buy you 
a cup of coffee somewhere and we 
could talk? I’m really anxious to find 
the library.” 

“I’ll go with you,” the woman 
agreed. “Although I have no idea 
what ‘coffee’ is. If you touch me 
I’ll nilp at once.” 

“Don’t do that,” Poul said, “it’s 
unnecessary; all I want to do is look 
up some historical material.” And 
then it occurred to him that he could 
make good use of any technical 
data he could get his hands on. 

What one volume might he smug- 
gle back to 1954 which would be of 
great value? He racked his brains. 
An almanac. A dictionary ... a 
school text on science which sur- 
veyed all the fields for laymen; yes, 
that would do it. A seventh grade 
text or a high school text. He could 
rip the covers off, throw them away, 
put the pages inside his coat. 

Poul said, “Where’s a school? The 
closest school.” He felt the urgency 


of it, now. He had no doubt that they 
were after him, close behind. 

“What is a ‘school?* ” the woman 
asked. 

“Where your children go,” Poul 
said. 

The woman said quietly, “You 
poor sick man.” 

V 

F or a time Tozzo and Fermeti and 
Gilly stood in silence. And then 
Tozzo said in a carefully controlled 
voice. “You know what’s going to 
happen to him, of course. Polpol will 
pick him up and mono-express him 
to Nachbaren Slager. Because of his 
appearance. He may even be there 
already.” 

Fermeti sprinted at once for the 
nearest vidphone. “I’m going to con- 
tact the authorities at Nachbaren 
Slager. I’ll talk to Potter; we can 
trust him, I think.” 

Presently Major Potter’s heavy, 
dark features formed on the vid- 
screen. “Oh, hello, Fermeti. You 
want more convicts, do you?” He 
chuckled. “You use them up even 
faster than we do.” 

Behind Potter, Fermeti caught a 
glimpse of the open recreation area 
of the giant internment camp. Crim- 
inals, both political and nonpol, could 
be seen roaming about, stretching 
their legs, some of them playing 
dull, pointless games which, he knew, 
went on and on, sometimes for 
months, each time they were out of 
their work-cells. 

“What we want,” Fermeti said, “is 
to prevent an individual being 


118 


IF 



brought to you at all.” He described 
Poul Anderson. “If he’s monoed 
there, call me at once. And don’t 
harm him. You understand? We want 
him back safe.” 

“Sure,” Potter said easily. “Just 
a minute; I’ll have a scan put on our 
new admissions.” He touched a but- 
ton to his right and a 315-R com- 
puter came on; Fermeti heard its 
low hum. Potter touched buttons and 
then said, “This’ll pick him out if 
he’s monoed here. Our admissions- 
circuit is prepared to . reject him.” 

“No sign yet?” Fermeti asked 
tensely. 

“Nope,” Potter said, and purpose- 
fully yawned. 

Fermeti broke the connection. 

“Now what?” Tozzo said. “We 
could possibly trace him by means 
of a Ganymedean sniffer-sponge.” 
They were a repellent life form, 
though; if one managed to find its 
quarry it fastened at once to its 
blood system leech-wise. “Or do it 
mechanically,” he added. “With a 
detec beam. We have a print of An- 
derson’s EEG pattern, don’t we? But 
that would really bring in the pol- 
pol.” The detec beam by law belong- 
ed only to the polpol; after all, it was 
the artifact which had, at last, track- 
ed down Gutman himself. 

Fermeti said bluntly, “I’m for 
broadcasting a planet-wide Type II 
alert. That’ll activate the citizenry, 
the average informer. They’ll know 
there’s an automatic reward for any 
Type II found.” 

“But he could be manhandled that 
way,” Gilly pointed out. “By a mob. 
Let’s think this through.” 


After a pause Tozzo said, “How 
about trying it from a purely cere- 
bral standpoint? If you had been 
transported from the mid twentieth 
century to our continuum, what 
would you want to do? Where would 
you go?" 

Quietly, Fermeti said, “To the 
nearest spaceport, of course. To buy 
a ticket to Mars or the outplanets — 
routine in our age but utterly out of 
the question at mid twentieth cen- 
tury.” 

They looked at one another. 

“But Anderson doesn’t know 
where the spaceport is,” Gilly said. 
“It’ll take him valuable time to or- 
ient himself. We can go there direct- 
ly by express subsurface mono.” 

A moment later the three Bureau 
of Emigration men were on their 
way. 

“A fascinating situation,” Gilly 
said, as they rode along, jiggling up 
and down, facing one another in the 
monorail first-class compartment. 
“We totally misjudged the mid twen- 
tieth century mind; it should be a les- 
son to us. Once we’ve regained pos- 
session of Anderson we should make 
further inquiries. For instance, the 
Poltergeist Effect. What was their 
interpretation of it? And table-tap- 
ping — did they recognize it for what 
it was? Or did they merely consign 
it to the realm of the so-called ‘oc- 
cult’ and let it go at that?” 

“Anderson may hold the clue to 
these questions and many others,” 
Fermeti said. “But our central prob- 
lem remains the same. We must in- 
duce him to complete the mass-res- 
toration formula in precise mathe^

matical terms, rather than vague, po- 
etic allusions.” 

Thoughtfully, Tozzo said, “He’s a 
brilliant man, that Anderson. Look 
at the ease by which he eluded us.” 
“Yes,” Fermeti agreed. “We 
mustn’t underestimate him. We did 
that, and it’s rebounded.” His face 
was grim. 

H urrying up the almost-deserted 
sidestreet, Poul Anderson won- 
dered why the woman had regarded 
him as sick. And the mention of 
children had set off the clerk in the 
store, too. Was birth illegal now? Or 
was it regarded as sex had been once, 
as something too private to speak of 
in public? 

In any case, he realized, if I plan 
to stay here I’ve got to shave my 
head. And, if possible, acquire dif- 
ferent clothing. 

There must be barbershops. And, 
he thought, the coins in my pockets; 
they’re probably worth a lot to col- 
lectors. 

He glanced about, hopefully. But 
all he saw were tall, luminous plas- 
tic and metal buildings which made 
up the city, structures in which in- 
comprehensible transactions took 
place. They were as alien to him as — 
Alien, he thought, and the word 
lodged chokingly in his mind. Because 
— something had oozed from a door- 
way ahead of him. And now his way 
was blocked — deliberately, it seemed 
— by a slime mold, dark yellow in 
color, as large as a human being, 
palpitating visibly on the sidewalk. 
After a pause the slime mold undu- 
lated toward him at a regular, slow 
rate. A human evolutionary devel- 
120 


opment? Poul Anderson wondered, 
recoiling from it. Good lord . and 
then he realized what he was seeing. 

This era had space travel. He was 
seeing a creature from another plan- 
et. 

“Um,” Poul said, to the enormous 
mass of slime mold, “can I bother 
you a second to ask a question?” 

The slime mold ceased to undu- 
late forward. And in Poul’s brain a 
thought formed which was not his 
own. “I catch your query. In an- 
swer: I arrived yesterday from Cal- 
listo. But I also catch a number of 
unusual and highly interesting 
thoughts in addition . you are a 
time traveler from the past.” The 
tone of the creature’s emanations 
was one of considerate, polite 
amusement — and interest. 

“Yes,” Poul said. “From 1954.” 
“And you wish to find a barber- 
shop, a library and a school. All at 
once, in the precious time remaining 
before they capture you.” The slime 
mold seemed solicitous. “What can 
I do to help you? I could absorb you, 
but it would be a permanent symbi- 
osis, and you would not like that. 
You are thinking of your wife and 
child. Allow me to inform you as to 
the problem regarding your unfor- 
tunate mention of children. Terrans 
of this period are experiencing a 
mandatory moratorium on childbirth, 
because of the almost infinite sport- 
ing of the previous decades. There 
was a war, you see. Between Gut- 
man’s fanatical followers and the 
more liberal legions of General Mc- 
Kinley. The latter won.” 

Poul said, “Where should I go? I’m 
confused.” His head throbbed and he 
felt tired. Too much had happened. 

IF 



Just a short while ago he had been 
standing with Tony Boucher in the 
Sir Francis Drake Hotel, drinking 
and chatting . and now this. Fac- 
ing this great slime mold from Cal- 
listo. It was difficult — to say the 
least — to make such an adjustment. 

T he slime mold was transmitting 
to him. “I am accepted here 
while you, their ancestor, are re- 
garded as odd. Ironic. To me, you 
look quite like them, except for your 
curly brown hair and of course your 
silly clothing. ,, The creature from 
Callisto pondered. “My friend, the 
polpol are the political police, and 
they search for deviants, followers 
of the defeated Gutman, who are 
terrorists now, and hated. Many of 
these followers are drawn from the 
potentially criminal classes. That is, 
the non-conformists, the so-called 
introves. Individuals who set their 
own subjective value-system up in 
place of the objective system in 
vogus. It is a matter of life and 
death to the Terrans, since Gutman 
almost won.” 

“I’m going to hide,” Poul den 
cided. 

“But where? You can’t really. Not 
unless you wish to go underground 
and join the Gutmanites, the crim- 
inal class of bomb-throwers . and 
you won’t want to do that. Let us 
stroll together, and if anyone chal- 
lenges you, I will say you’re my ser- 
vant. You have manual extensors 
and I have not. And I have, by a 
quirk, decided to dress you oddly 
and to have you retain your head- 
hair. The responsibility then becomes 
mine. It is actually not unusual for 


higher out-world organisms to em- 
ploy Terran help.” 

“Thanks,” Poul said tautly, as the 
slime mold resumed its slow forward 
motion along the sidewalk. “But 
there are things I want to do — ” 

“I am on my way to the zoo,” the 
slime mold continued. 

An unkind thought came to Poul. 

“Please,” the slime mold said. 
“Your anachronistic twentieth cen- 
tury humor is not appreciated. I am 
not an inhabitant of the zoo; it is 
for life forms of low mental order 
such as Martian glebs and trawns. 
Since the initiation of interplane- 
tary travel, zoos have become the 
center of — ” 

Poul said, “Could you lead me to 
the space terminal?” He tried to 
make his request sound casual. 

“You take a dreadful risk,” the 
slime mold said, “in going to any 
public place. The polpol watch con- 
stantly.” 

“I still want to go.” If he could 
board an interplanetary ship, if he 
could leave Earth, see other worlds — 

But they would erase his mem- 
ory; all at once he realized that, in 
a rush of horror. I’ve got to make 
notes , he told himself. At once! 

“Do, um, you have a pencil?” he 
asked the slime mold. “Oh, wait; I 
have one. Pardon me.” Obviously the 
slime mold didn’t. 

On a piece of paper from his 
coat pocket — it was convention ma- 
terial of some sort — he wrote hur- 
riedly, in brief, disjointed phrases, 
what had happened to him, what he 
had seen in the twenty-first century. 
Then he quickly stuck the paper 
back in his pocket. 


WATERSPIDER 


121 



“A wise move,” the slime mold 
said. “And now to the spaceport, if 
you will accompany me at my slow 
pace. And, as we go, I will give 
you details of Terra’s history from 
your period on.” The slime mold 
moved down the sidewalk. Poul ac- 
companied it eagerly; after all, what 
choice did he have? “The Soviet Un- 
ion. That was tragic. Their war with 
Red China in 1983 which finally in- 
volved Israel and France . regret- 
table, but it did solve the problem 
of what to do with France — a most 
difficult nation to deal with in the 
latter half of the twentieth century.” 
On his piece of paper Poul jotted 
that down, too. 

“After France had been defeated 
— ” The slime mold went on, as Poul 
scratched against time. 

F ermeti said, “We must glin, if 
we’re to catch Anderson before 
he boards a ship.” And by “glin” he 
did not mean glinning a little; he 
meant a full search with the coop- 
eration of the polpol. He hated to 
bring them in, and yet their help 
now seemed vital. Too much time 
had passed and Anderson had not 
yet been found. 

The spaceport lay ahead, a great 
disk miles in diameter, with no ver- 
tical obstructions. In the center was 
the Burned Spot, seared by years of 
tail-exhausts from landing and de- 
parting ships. Fermeti liked the 
spaceport, because here the denseness 
of the close-packed buildings of the 
city abruptly ceased. Here was open- 
ness, such as he recalled from child- 
hood ... if one dared to think open- 
ly of childhood. 


The terminal building was set 
hundreds of feet beneath the rexe- 
roid layer built to protect the wait- 
ing people in case of an accident 
above. Fermeti reached the entrance 
of the descent ramp, then halted im- 
patiently to wait for Tozzo and Gilly 
to catch up with him. 

“I’ll nilp,” Tozzo said, but with- 
out enthusiasm. And he broke the 
band on his wrist with a single de- 
cisive motion. 

The polpol ship hovered overhead 
at once. 

“We’re from the Emigration Bu- 
reau,” Fermeti explained to the pol- 
pol lieutenant. He outlined their 
Project, described — reluctantly — 
their bringing Poul Anderson from 
his time-period to their own. 

“Hair on head,” the polpol lieu- 
tenant noted. “Quaint duds. Okay, 
Mr. Fermeti; we’ll glin until we 
find him.” He nodded, and his small 
ship shot off. 

“They’re efficient,” Tozzo admit- 
ted. 

“But not likeable,” Fermeti said, 
finishing Tozzo’s thought. 

“They make me uncomfortable,” 
Tozzo agreed. “But I suppose they’re 
supposed to.” 

The three of them stepped onto the 
descent ramp — and dropped at 
breathtaking speed to level one be- 
low. Fermeti shut his eyes, wincing 
at the loss of weight. It was almost 
as bad as takeoff itself. Why did ev- 
erything have to be so rapid, these 
days? It certainly was not like the 
previous decade, when things had 
gone leisurely. 

They stepped from the ramp, 
shook themselves, and were ap- 


122 


IF 



proached instantly by the building’s 
polpol chief. 

“We have a report on your man,” 
the gray-uniformed officer told 
them. 

“He hasn't taken off?” Fermeti 
said. “Thank God.” He looked 
around. 

“Over there,” the officer said, 
pointing. 

At a magazine rack, Poul Ander- 
son was looking intently at the dis>- 
play. 

It took only a moment for the three 
Emigration Bureau officials to sur- 
round him. 

“Oh, uh, hello,” Anderson said. 
“While I was waiting for my ship 
I thought I’d take a look and see 
what’s still in print.” 

Fermeti said, “Anderson, we re- 
quire your unique abilities. I’m sorry, 
but we’re taking you back to the 
Bureau.” 

All at once Anderson was gone. 
Soundlessly, he had ducked away; 
they saw his tall, angular form be- 
come smaller as he raced for the 
gate to the field proper. 

Reluctantly, Fermeti reached 
within his coat and brought out a 
sleep-gun. “There’s no other choice,” 
he murmured, and squeezed. 

The racing figure tumbled, rolled. 
Fermeti put the sleep-gun away and 
in a toneless voice said, “He’ll re- 
cover. A skinned knee, nothing 
worse.” He glanced at Gilly and 
Tozzo. “Recover at the Bureau, I 
mean.” 

Together, the three of them ad- 
vanced toward the prone figure on 
the floor of the spaceport waiting 
room. 


CCyLTou may return to your own 
I time-continuum,” Fermeti 
said quietly, “when you’ve given us 
the mass-restoration formula.” He 
nodded, and a Bureau workman ap- 
proached, carrying the ancient Roy- 
al portable typewriter. 

Seated in the chair across from 
Fermeti in the Bureau’s inner busi- 
ness office, Poul Anderson said, “I 
don’t use a portable.” 

“You must cooperate,” Fermeti 
informed him. “We have the scien- 
tific know-how to restore you to 
Karen; remember Karen and remem- 
ber your newly-born daughter at the 
Congress in San Francisco’s Sir Fran- 
cis Drake Hotel. Without full co- 
operation from you, Anderson, there 
will be no cooperation from the Bu- 
reau. Surely, with your pre-cog abil- 
ity you can see that.” 

After a pause Anderson said, 
“Um, I can’t work unless I have a 
pot of fresh coffee brewing around 
me at all times, somewhere.” 
Curtly, Fermeti signaled. “We’ll 
obtain coffee beans for you,” he de- 
clared. “But the brewing is up to 
you. We’ll also supply a pot from 
the Smithsonian collection and there 
our responsibility ends.” 

Taking hold of the carriage of the 
typewriter, Anderson began to in- 
spect it. “Red and back ribbon,” 
he said. “I always use black. But 
I guess I can make do.” He seemed 
a trifle sullen. Inserting a sheet of 
paper, he began to type. At the top of 
the page appeared the words: 
NIGHT FLIGHT 
— Poul Anderson 
“You say If bought it?” he asked 
Fermeti. 


WATERSPIDER 


123 



“Yes,” Fermeti replied tensely. 

Anderson typed: 

Difficulties at Outward, Incor- 
porated had begun to nettle Ed- 
mond Fletcher. For one thing, an 
entire ship had disappeared, and 
although the individuals aboard 
were not personally known to him 
he felt a twinge of responsibility. 
Now, as he lathered himself with 
hormone-impregnated soap 

“He starts at the beginning,” Fer- 
meti said bitingly. “Well, if there’s 
no alternative we’ll simply have to 
bear with him.” Musingly, he mur- 
mured, “I wonder how long it takes 
. I wonder how fast he writes. As 
a pre-cog he can see what’s coming 
next; it should help him to do it 
in a hurry.” Or was that just wish- 
ful thinking? 

“Have the coffee beans arrived 
yet?” Anderson asked, glancing up. 

“Any time now,” Fermeti said. 

“I hope some of the beans are Co- 
lombian,” Anderson said. 

L ong before the beans arrived the 
article was done. 

Rising stiffly, uncoiling his lengthy 
limbs, Poul Anderson said, “I think 
you have what you want, there. The 
mass restoration formula is on type- 
script page 20.” 

Eagerly, Fermeti turned the pages. 
Yes, there it was; peering over his 
shoulder, Tozzo saw the paragraph: 

If the ship followed a trajectory 
which would carry it into the star 
Proxima, it would, he realized, re- 
gain its mass through a process of 


leeching solar energy from the 
great star-furnace itself. Yes, it 
was Proxima itself which held the 
key to Torelli’s problem, and now, 
after all this time, it had been 
solved. The simple formula re- 
volved in his brain. 

And, Tozzo saw, there lay the for- 
mula. As the article said, the mass 
would be regained from solar en- 
ergy converted into matter, the ulti- 
mate source of power in the uni- 
verse. The answer had stared them in 
the face all this time! 

Their long struggle was over. 

“And now,” Poul Anderson asked, 
“I’m free to go back to my own 
time?” 

Fermeti said simply, “Yes.” 

“Wait,” Tozzo said to his superior. 
“There’s evidently something you 
don’t understand.” It was a section 
which he had read in the instruction 
manual attached to the time-dredge. 
He drew Fermeti to one side, where 
Anderson could not hear. “He can’t 
be sent back to his own time with 
the knowledge he has now.” 

“What knowledge?” Fermeti in- 
quired. 

“That — well. I’m not certain. 
Something to do with our society, 
here. What I’m trying to tell you is 
this: the first rule of time travel, ac- 
cording to the manual, is don’t 
change the past. In this situation just 
bringing Anderson here has changed 
the past merely by exposing him to 
our society.” 

Pondering, Fermeti said, “You 
may be correct. While he was in that 
gift shop he may have picked up 
some object which, taken back to 


124 


IF 



his own time, might revolutionize 
their technology.” 

“Or at the magazine rack at the 
spaceport,” Tozzo said. “Or on his 
trip between those two points. And 
— even the knowledge that he and 
his colleagues are pre-cogs." 

“You’re right,” Fermeti said. “The 
memory of this trip must be wiped 
from his brain.” He turned and 
walked slowly back to Poul Ander- 
son. “Look here,” he addressed him. 
“I’m sorry to tell you this, but ev- 
erything that’s happened to you must 
be wiped from your brain.” 

After a pause, Anderson said, 
“That’s a shame. Sorry to hear that.” 
He looked downcast. “But I’m not 
surprised,” he murmured. He seemed 
philosophical about the whole af- 
fair. “It’s generally handled this 
way.” 

Tozzo asked, “Where can this al- 
teration of the memory cells of his 
brain be accomplished?” 

“At the Department of Penology,” 
Fermeti said. “Through the same 
channels we obtained the convicts.” 
Pointing his sleep-gun at Poul An- 
derson he said, “Come along with 
us. I regret this . but it has to 
be done.” 

VI 

A t the Department of Penology, 
painless electroshock removed 
from Poul Anderson’s brain the pre- 
cise cells in which his most recent 
memories were stored. Then, in a 
semi-conscious state, he was carried 
back into the time-dredge. A mo- 
ment later he was on his trip back 
to the year 1954, to his own society 


and time. To the Sir Francis Drake 
Hotel in downtown San Francisco, 
California and his waiting wife and 
child. 

When the time-dredge returned 
empty, Tozzo, Gilly and Fermeti 
breathed a sigh of relief and broke 
open a bottle of hundred-year-old 
Scotch which Fermeti had been sav- 
ing. The mission had been success- 
fully accomplished; now they could 
turn their attention back to the 
Project. 

“Where’s the manuscript that he 
wrote?” Fermeti said, putting down 
his glass to look all around his of- 
fice. 

There was no manuscript to be 
found. And, Tozzo noticed, the an- 
tique Royal portable typewriter 
which they had brought from the 
Smithsonian — it was gone, too. But 
why? 

Suddenly chill fear traveled up 
him. He understood. 

“Good lord,” he said thickly. He 
put down his glass. “Somebody get 
a copy of the journal with his ar- 
ticle in it. At once.” 

Fermeti said, “What is it, Aaron? 
Explain.” 

“When we removed his memory 
of what had happened we made it 
impossible for him to write the an- 
ticle for the journal,” Tozzo said. 
“He must have based Night Flight 
on his experience with us, here.” 
Snatching up the August 1955 copy 
of If he turned to the table-of-con- 
tents page. 

No article by Poul Anderson was 
listed. Instead, on page 78, he saw 
Philip K. Dick’s The Mold of Yancy 
listed instead. 


WATERSPIDER

They had changed the past after 
all. And now the formula for their 
Project was gone — gone entirely. 

“We shouldn’t have tampered,” 
Tozzo said in a hoarse voice. “We 
should never have brought him out of 
the past.” He drank a little more of 
the century-old Scotch, his hands 
shaking. 

“Brought who?” Gilly said, with a 
puzzled look. 

“Don’t you remember?” Tozzo 
stared at him, incredulous. 

“What’s this discussion about?” 
Fermeti said impatiently. “And what 
are you two doing in my office? You 
both should be busy at work.” He 
saw the bottle of Scotch and blanch- 
ed. “How’d that get open?” 

His hands trembling, Tozzo turn- 
ed the pages of the journal over and 
over again. Already, the memory was 
growing diffuse in his mind; he 
struggled in vain to hold onto it. They 
had brought someone from the past, 
a pre-cog, wasn’t it? But who? A 
name, still in his mind but dimming 
with each passing moment . An- 
derson or Anderton* something like 
that. And in connection with the Bu- 
reau’s interstellar mass-deprivation 
Project. 

Or was it? 

Puzzled, Tozzo shook his head and 
said in bewilderment, “I have some 
peculiar wprds in my mind. Night 
Flight. Do either of you happen to 
know what it refers to?” 

“ Night Flight ” Fermeti echoed. 
“No, it means nothing to me. I won- 
der, though — it certainly would be 
an effective name for our Project.” 

“Yes,” Gilly agreed. “That must 
be what it refers to.” 


“But our Project is called Water- 
spider , isn’t it?” Tozzo said. At least 
he thought it was. He blinked, trying 
to focus his faculties. 

“The truth of the matter,” Fer- 
meti said, “is that we’ve never titled 
it.” Brusquely, he added, “But I 
agree with you; that’s an even better 
name for it. Waterspider . Yes, I like 
that.” 

The door of the office opened and 
there stood a uniformed, bonded 
messenger. “From the Smithsonian,” 
he informed them. “You requested 
this.” He produced a parcel, which 
he laid on Fermeti’s desk. 

“I don’t remember ordering any- 
thing from the Smithsonian,” Fer- 
meti said. Opening it cautiously he 
found a can of roasted, ground cof- 
fee beans, still vacuum packed, over 
a century old. 

The three men looked at one an- 
other blankly. 

“Strange,” Torelli murmured. 
“There must be some mistake.” 

“Well,” Fletcher said, “in any 
case, back to Project Waterspider 

Nodding, Torelli and Gilman turn- 
ed in the direction of their own of- 
fice on the first floor of Outward, 
Incorporated, the commercial firm at 
which they worked and the project 
on which they had labored, with so 
many heartaches and setbacks, for 
so long. 

A t the Science Fiction Convention 
at the Sir Francis Drake Hotel, 
Poul Anderson looked around him 
in bewilderment. Where had he 
been? Why had he gone out of the 
building? And it was an hour later; 
Tony Boucher and Jim Gunn had 


126 


IF 



left for dinner by now, and he saw 
no sign of his wife Karen and the 
baby, either. 

The last he remembered was two 
fans from Battlecreek who wanted 
him to look at a display outside on 
the sidewalk. Perhaps he had gone 
to see that. In any case, he had no 
memory of the interval. 

Anderson groped about in his coat 
pocket for his pipe, hoping to calm 
his oddly jittery nerves — and found, 
not his pipe, but instead a folded 
piece of paper. 

“Got anything for our auction, 
Poul?” a member of the Convention 
committee asked, halting beside him. 
“The auction is just about to start 
— we have to hurry.” 

Still looking at the paper from his 
pocket, Poul murmured, “Urn, you 
mean something here with me?” 

“Like a typescript of some pub- 
lished story, the original manuscript 
or earlier versions or notes. You 
know.” He paused, waiting. 

“I seem to have some notes in my 
pocket,” Poul said, still glancing 


over them. They were in his hand- 
writing but he didn't remember hav- 
ing made them. A time-travel story, 
from the look of them. Must have 
been from those Bourbons and wa- 
ter, he decided, and not enough to 
eat. “Here,” he said uncertainly, “it 
isn’t much but I guess you can auc- 
tion these.” He took one final glance 
at them. “Notes for a story about a 
political figure called Gutman and 
a kidnapping in time. Intelligent slime 
mold, too, I notice.” On impulse, he 
handed them over. 

“Thanks, the man said, and 
hurried on toward the other room, 
where the auction was being held. 

“I bid ten dollars,” Howard 
Browne called, smiling broadly. 
“Then I have to catch a bus to the 
airport.” The door closed after him. 

Karen, with Astrid, appeared be- 
side Poul. “Want to go into the auc- 
tion?” she asked her husband. “Buy 
an original Finlay?” 

“Urn, sure,” Poul Anderson said, 
and with his wife and child walked 
slowly after Howard Browne. END

The Place Where Readers 
And Editor Meet... 


Dear Editor: 

IF is looking up. Congratulations 
on A. E. Van Vogt — how’d you do 
it? Also Manners and Customs of 
the Thrid was good, and so was The 
Reefs of Space. 

Fve got one beef, though. What 
happened to the colored pic back- 
grounds? Also try to get Isaac Asi- 
mov, R.A.H. and Damor Knight, 
eh? 

One more question: How do you 
get your IFs back after loaning 
them? — Walter E. Haun, R.R. Long- 
ville, Minnesota. 

• Answer: With difficulty. — Edi- 
tor.

Dear Editor: 

I have come to the conclusion that 
IF is making a supreme determina- 
tion in doing everything to uphold 
the dignity of science fiction — by 
printing stories better by far than 
many others which pass as sf these 
days. I have been a fan since I 
was 13 years old. After 8 years of 
reading sf, I have reached the de- 
cision that IF beats all. In my opin- 
ion, anyone of reasonable intelli- 
gence and imagination is a potential 

128 


sf fan — which state changes to a 
reality when such a person finds 
himself presented with a good sf 
magazine. Many characters who 
pass through the pages of IF will 
undoubtedly live — I think. Clearcut 
stories of reality that invoke fact, 
fiction, prophecy and sometimes 
“IF”-ness. A friend of mine asked, 
“But is it fact or fiction?” Say what 
you like, but it still leaves a great 
deal of questions unanswered. So, 
Mr. Editor, — keep printing, keep up 
the great stories and, stone the 
crows, mate, keep IF rolling —

Dear Editor: 

Why not combine IF y Galaxy and 
Worlds of Tomorrow into one 230- 
page monthly 50c magazine? You 
could get more advertising by say- 
ing you had the combined circula- 
tion of the three magazines, and 
with the money you get from adver- 
tising you could have a better maga- 
zine. I also wonder why the Guinn 
magazines don’t have classified ad- 
vertising as brands Z-D and M do. 

IF 


Also, wher are the Retief stories 
going to be combined into a full- 
sized book? — Irvin M. Koch, 1623 
White Oak Road, Chattanooga 5, 
Tennessee. 

• (1) Because we'd lose money. 
(2) Sounds like a good idea — may- 
be we'll try it. (3) They just have,

Dear Editor: 

This September issue of IF is the 
first I've bought in a few issues. 
Van Vogt's story sold it to me, of 
course. I got my money's worth. It 
is certainly a pleasure to have him 
back in science fiction. 

Mary Larson's The Time of Cold 
was a comfortable second. I'll look 
for her name in future numbers; 
there are not enough upbeat writers 
in the field. 

Don't you think that the belief in 
sympathetic magic you display on 
the inside back cover is rather out 
of keeping with the editor of a sci- 
ence-fiction magazine? — Richard 
Kyle, 2126 Earl Avenue, Long Beach, 
California, 90806. 

• For those who miss the point of 
this last remark (a group which in- 
cluded your editor until he went and 
got a copy of the magazine to check 
up), the reference is to the fact that 
the page in question contained an ad 
which was clearly meant to appear in 
Galaxy , not IF . By the way, 
more Van Vogt is on the way. One 
story in, more promised; but we're 
not just sure yet when they will 

appear — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

This letter is going to be a dis- 
sertation on letter columns, other- 
wise known as lettercols. So sit 
right back, relax and prepare your- 
self to hear a sermon of sorts. 


The first thing that needs to be 
taken care of, naturally, is to de- 
fine the purpose of a letter column 
in relation to a sf magazine. First 
of all, it should serve as ? sounding 
board for ideas; a place where 
ideas can be expounded or criticized. 
It should be a form of a forum 
where concepts are studied, analyzed, 
investigated. Secondly, it should not 
be a place where, primarily, likes 
and dislikes in regards to. stories, 
art or artists are put forth. These 
comments are of no consequence and 
waste space. 

“Whoa, check, gasp. Wait a min- 
ute here!” you say. “How in hell 
am I supposed to know what t^e 
readers want? These gripes are ne- 
cessary in order that I may give 
them what they want.” 

I agree completely. Don't get me 
wrong; I'm not saying that the 
comments are bad or should be dis- 
regarded. I'm saying that you 
shouldn't publish them. Let's face 
it: what nobody else thinks about 
a story doesn't make a bit of dif- 
ference to me. I've already made up 
my mind, and like nothin's going 
to change it! Such matters are com- 
pletely subjective and so are not 
open to discussion or argument. 

As things now stand only one 
magazine has a letter column that 
consistently fills the above require- 
ments — Analog. Oh, sure, If, Amaz- 
ing and Fantastic occasionally print 
a letter that is worth reading, but 
not consistently. 

The next question is, what is 
there to write about? After all, as 
“P.C.” said in the September, 1962, 
IF, it gets kind of hard to write 
editorials worth writing letters 
about, month after month. 

Let's stop and think a minute. Just 
why do fen read sf ? For escape? Not 
likely. For mental stimulation! And 
how do you get mental stimula- 


HUE AND CRY 


129 



tion? By reading about concepts, 
ideas, philosophies! And where can 
these ideas be found in science fic- 
tion? In the stories. If you stop 
and give it some thought, isn’t each 
and every story in the science-fic- 
tion field, for the most part, an ed- 
itorial in itself? Expounding some 
thought? Damning some habit? 
Criticizing an idea? Heck sakes, ev- 
ery issue of an sf magazine has at 
least two or three concepts to write 
about ! 

Lastly I would like to make a 
general observation about letter col- 
umns. That is the manner, style, 
tone in which the letters published 
are written. Some time ago I got 
hold of some issues of Thrilling 
Wonder Stories , Startling Stories 
and Fantastic Story Quarterly. Now 
the lettercols in said magazines were 
really something! Sure, the letter 
writers called each other names 
while in the process of making some 
point, but, heck, that was what made 
the columns so fascinating. It seems 
to me that the quality which the 
letter columns of today are missing 
is humanness. All the columns, in- 
cluding Analog* j, seem unnatural, 
forced, inhuman. — Jim Maughan, 
230 N Street, Turn water, Washing- 
ton. 

• There’s one thing that an editor 
can’t do to improve his letter col- 
umns: he can’t write the letters! 
That’s up to you fellows out there. 
— Editor .

Dear Editor: 

The Expendables first new Van 
Vogt story in fourteen years? Please 
check the January, 1932 issue of 
Scientific American. The Hoffman 
Electronics Corporation ran a two 
page ad, and an sf story by Van 
Vogt was the focal point. It was call- 
ed Itseif, 


The Hoffman people ran a series 
of six sf-oriented ads during ’62, 
each with a short-short by an author 
such as Van Vogt, Heinlein, Asimov 
and Leiber. Each was billed “a 
science-fiction original created ex- 
pressly for Hoffman Electronics 
Corporation” and served as a step- 
ping-off point for a discussion on 
“How Science Fiction Becomes Sci- 
entific Fact.” — Kenneth Burington, 
129 South Meadow Drive, Glen Bur- 
nie, Maryland 

• When we bought. Van Vogt’s 
story, we asked him how long it had 
been since he had written a story 
for an sf magazine — the 14-year fig- 
ure was his. And, of course, it’s 
true enough; he (and we) didn’t 
think of the story appearing in the 
advertisement any more than we 
thought of his non-sf novel about 
communism in Asia, etc. — Editor . 

That fills us up for another issue. 
Coming next time: a new Retief by 
Keith Laumer, The City That Grew 
in the Sea (and we think’s it’s one 
of the best ever) — the conclusion of 
Pcul Anderson’s exciting Three 
Worlds to Conquer — In Saturn 9 8 
Rings , oy Robert F. Young — and 
lots more. 

As old hands know, each issue 
we print at least one story by some- 
one who has never before appeared 
in a science-fiction magazine. The 
idea is to give new talent a chance 
at a hearing, and thus to keep up 
the supply of new blood that every 
field needs. This issue we have two: 
The Competitors , by an Oklahoman 
who has been published a time or 
two before in other fields, but ap- 
pears here with his first science-fic- 
tion story ever, and Mack , by a 
Kentucky newspaperman making his 
first stab at fiction of any kind. 
We think you’ll be hearing more 
from both of them I — FP
