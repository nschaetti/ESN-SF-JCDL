feather, and there was no need to tell Mel 



by the company he kept — it told him ! 



A LL through that Saturday 
night, rain drummed down 
mercilessly and unseasonably 
on Sweetwater Beach. Thun- 
der pealed and lightning 
flared. In between, Mel Arm- 
strong heard the steady boom 
of the Pacific surf not a block 
from his snug little duplex 
apartment. Mel didn’t mind 
any of it. He was in bed, 
slightly swacked and wholly 
comfortable. He dozed, and 
now and then woke up far 
enough to listen admiringly to 
the racket. 

At nine A. M., when he open- 
ed his eyes once more, he dis- 
covered the room was full of 



tuooA

summer sunshine. Beyond his 
window gleamed a cloudless 
sky, and only the occasional 
gusts of wind indicated there 
had been anything like a 
storm during the night. 

An exceptionally beautiful 
Sunday morning — made more 
beautiful, perhaps, by the fact 
that it marked the beginning 
of Mel Armstrong's annual 
two-week paid vacation. Mel 
was a salesman for Marty's 
Fine Liquors, a wholesale 
house. He was twenty-eight 
and in fairly good shape, but 
his job bored him. This morn- 
ing, for the first time in 
months, he was fully aware of 
that. Perhaps it was the 
weather. At any rate, he had 
a sense, almost a premonition, 
of new and exciting events 
approaching him rapidly. 
Events that would break down 
the boundaries of his present 
humdrum existence and pitch 
him into the life of romantic 
adventure that, somehow, he 
seemed to have missed so 
far . 

Recognizing this as a day- 
dream, but unwilling to give 
it up completely, Mel break- 
fasted unhurriedly in his pa- 
jamas. Then, struck by a 
sudden, down-to-earth suspi- 
cion, he stuck his head out of 
his living room window. 

As he'd guessed, there were 
other reminders of the storm 
in the narrow courtyard be- 
fore the window. Branches 
and assorted litter had blown 
in, including at least one sog- 

6 



gily dismembered Sunday pa- 
per. The low rent he paid for 
his ground-floor apartment in 
the Oceanview Courts was 
based on an understanding 
with the proprietor that he 
and the upstairs occupant of 
the duplex would keep the 
court clean. The other five 
duplexes that fronted on the 
court were bulging with vaca- 
tioning visitors from the city, 
which made it a real chore in 
summer. 

Unfortunately, he couldn't 
count on his upstairs neigh- 
bor, a weird though rather 
amiable young character who 
called herself Maria de Gues- 
gne. Maria went in for paint- 
ing abstractions, constructing 
mobiles, and discussing the 
works of Madame Blavatsky. 
She avoided the indignity of 
manual toil. 

Mel made himself decent by 
exchanging his pajamas for 
swimming trunks. Then he 
got a couple of brooms and a 
hose out of a garage back of 
the court and went to work. 

H E'D cleared the courtyard 
by the time the first of 
the seasonal guests began to 
show up in their doorways, 
and went on to inspect an- 
other, narrower court behind 
his duplex, which was also his 
responsibility. There he dis- 
covered Maria de Guesgne 
propped on her elbows on her 
bedroom window sill, talking 
reproachfully to a large gray 
tomcat that was sitting in the 

JAMES H. SCHMITZ 




court. Both turned to look at 
Mel. 

“Good morning, Mel!” Ma- 
ria said, with unusual anima- 
tion. She had long black bangs 
which emphasized her sallow 
and undernourished appear- 
ance. 

“Morning,” Mel replied. 
“Scat!” he added to the cat, 
which belonged to somebody 
else in the neighborhood but 
was usually to be found stalk- 
ing about the Oceanview 
Courts. 

“You shouldn’t frighten 
poor Cat,” said Maria. “Mel, 
would you look into the bird 
box?” 

“Bird box?” 

“The one in the climbing 
rose,” said Maria, leaning 
precariously from the window 
to point. “To your left. Cat 
was trying to get at it.” 

The bird box was a white- 
painted, weather-beaten little 
house set into a straggly rose 
bush that grew out of a square 
patch of earth beside Mel’s 
bedroom window. The box was 
about ten feet above the 
ground. 

Mel looked up at it. 

“I’m sure I heard little 
birds peeping in it this morn- 
ing!” Maria explained senti- 
mentally. 

“No bird in its senses would 
go into a thing like that,” Mel 
assured her. “I don’t hear 
anything. And besides — ” 

“Please, Mel! We don’t 
want Cat to get them!” 

Mel groaned, got a wobbly 

SUMMER GUESTS 



stepladder out of the garage 
and climbed up. The gray cat 
walked over and sat down 
next to the ladder to watch 
him. 

He poked at the box and lis- 
tened. No sound. 

“Can’t you open the top and 
look in?” Maria inquired. 

Holding the box in one 
hand, Mel tentatively inserted 
his thumbnail into a crack un- 
der its top and pushed. The 
weathered wood splintered 
away easily. 

“Don’t break it!” Maria 
cried. 

Mel put his eye to the crack 
he’d made. Then he gasped, 
jerked back, letting go of the 
box, teetered wildly a moment 
and fell over with the step- 
ladder. The cat fled, spitting. 

“Oh, my!” said Maria, ap- 
parently with some enjoy- 
ment. “Poor Mel ! Are you 
hurt?” 

Mel stood up slowly. The 
bright morning world seemed 
to be spinning gently around 
him, but it wasn’t because of 
his fall. “Of course not,” he 
said. His voice quavered 
somewhat. 

“Oh?” said Maria. “Well, 
then — are there any little 
birds in the nest?” 

Mel swallowed hard. “No,” 
he said. He bent over and 
carefully picked up the ladder 
and placed it against the wall. 
The action made it unneces- 
sary to look at her. 

“Eggs?” she asked in a 
hopeful tone. 

7 




"No eggs either! No noth- 
ing!” His voice was steady 
again, but he had to get rid of 
Maria. “Well, I’ll clean up this 
court now, I guess. Uh — may- 
be you’d like to come down 
and lend a hand?” 

Maria replied promptly that 
she certainly would like to, 
but she hadn’t had breakfast 
yet ; and with that she vanish- 
ed from the window. 

Mel looked round stealthily. 
The cat was watching from 
the door of the garage, but no 
one else was in sight. 

Hurriedly, he replaced the 
stepladder under the bird nest 
and climbed up again. 

S ETTING the box carefully 
down on the table in his 
living room, he locked the 
apartment door and closed the 
Venetian blinds. All this had 
been done in a sort of quiet 
rush, as if every second count- 
ed, which it did in a way. Mel 
wasn’t going to believe, even 
for a moment, that what he 
thought he’d seen in that box 
could be really there; and he 
couldn’t disprove it fast 
enough to suit him. But some- 
thing warned him that he 
wouldn’t want to have any 
witnesses around when he did 
take his second look. 

Then, as he turned from the 
window, he heard a thin pip- 
ing cry, a voice as tiny as the 
peeping of a mouse, coming 
from the table, from the box. 

An instant fright reaction 
froze him where he stood. The 

8 



sounds stopped again. There 
was a brief, faint rustle, like 
the stirring of dry parchment, 
and then quiet. 

The rustling, he thought, 
must have been the wings — 
he’d been sure they had wings. 
Otherwise — 

It could all have been an 
illusion, he told himself. An 
illusion that transformed a 
pair of featherless nestlings 
into something he still didn’t 
want to give a name to. Color 
patterns of jade and pink 
flashed into his memory next, 
however, which made the bird 
theory shaky. Say a rather 
small green-and-pink snake 
then, or a lizard — 

Except, of course, for the 
glassy glitter of the wings. So 
make it instead, Mel thought 
desperately, a pair of big in- 
sects, like dragonflies, only 
bigger . 

He shook his head and mois- 
tened his lips. That wouldn’t 
explain that tiny voice — and 
the more he tried to rational- 
ize it all, the more scared he 
was getting. Assume, he took 
the mental jump, he really had 
seen the figures of two tiny, 
naked, green-and-pink people 
in there — with wings ! One 
didn’t have to drag in the sup- 
ernatural to explain it. There 
were things like flying sau- 
cers, presumably, and proba- 
bly such beings might exist on 
other worlds. 

The thought was oddly re- 
assuring. He still felt as if 
he’d locked himself in the 



JAMES H. SCHMITZ 




room with things potentially 
in the class of tarantulas, but 
there was excitement and 
wonder coming up now. With 
a surge of jealous proprietor- 
ship, he realized that he didn’t 
want to share this discovery 
with anybody else. Later, per- 
haps. Right now, it was his 
big adventure. 

The room was too dim to let 
him distinguish anything in- 
side the box as he had out- 
doors, and he was still reluc- 
tant to get his face too close 
to it. He gave it a gingerly 
rap with his knuckle and 
waited. No sound. 

He cleared his throat. 
“Hello?” he said. Immediately, 
that seemed like an idiotic ap- 
proach. Worse than that, it 
also brought no reaction. 

For the first time, Mel had 
a sense of worry for the oc- 
cupants of the box. There was 
no way of guessing how they’d 
got in there, but they might be 
sick or dying. Hurriedly he 
brought a lamp over to the 
table and tried to direct light 
inside, both through the round 
hole in its side and through 
the opening he’d made in the 
top. It wasn’t very effective 
and produced no stir within. 

With sudden decision, he 
shoved one hand into the open- 
ing, held the box with the 
other and broke off the entire 
top. And there they were. 

Mel stared at them a long 
time, his fears fading slowly. 
They were certainly alive ! 
One was green, a tiny body of 

SUMMER GUESTS 



luminous jade, and the other 
was silkily human-colored, 
which was why he had been 
confused on that point. The 
wings could hardly be any- 
thing else, though they were 
very odd-looking, almost like 
thin, flexible glass. 

He couldn’t force himself to 
touch them. Instead, he laid a 
folded clean towel on the table 
and tilted the box very slowly 
over it. A series of careful 
tappings and shakings brought 
the two beings sliding gently 
out onto the towel. 

Two delicately formed fe- 
male figurines, they lay there 
a moment, unmoving. Then 
the green one passed a tiny 
hand over her forehead in a 
slow, completely human ges- 
ture, opened slanted golden 
eyes with startled suddenness 
and looked up at Mel. 

He might still have thought 
he was dreaming, if his atten- 
tion hadn’t been caught just 
then by a detail of undream- 
like realism. The other, the 
human-colored one, seemed to 
be definitely in a family way. 

T HEY were sitting on the 
folded bath towel in a 
square of afternoon sunlight 
which came in through the 
kitchenette window. The win- 
dow was high enough up so 
nobody could look in from out- 
side, and they seemed to want 
the warmth of the sun more 
than anything else. They did 
not appear to be sick, but they 
were still rather languid. It 

9 




wasn’t starvation, apparently. 
Mel had put bits of a variety 
of foods on a napkin before 
them, and he changed the 
samples as soon as his guests 
indicated they weren’t inter- 
ested. So far, canned sardine 
was the only item that had at- 
tracted them at all, and they 
hadn’t done much more than 
test that. 

Between moments of just 
marveling at them, assuring 
himself they were there and 
not an illusion, and wonder- 
ing what they were then and 
where they’d come from, Mel 
was beginning to get worried 
again. For all he knew, they 
might suddenly die on the bath 
towel. 

“Miss Green,” he said in a 
very low voice — he didn’t 
want to give Maria de Gues- 
gne any indication he was in 
the house — “I wish you could 
tell me what you like to eat!” 

Miss Green looked up at him 
and smiled. She was much 
more alert and vivacious than 
the other one who, perhaps be- 
cause of her condition, merely 
sat or lay there gracefully and 
let Miss Green wait on her. 
The relationship seemed to be 
about that of an elf princess 
and her personal attendant, 
but they were much too real- 
seeming creatures to have 
popped out of a fairy tale, 
though their appearance did 
arouse recurrent bursts of a 
feeling of fairy tale unreality, 
which Mel hadn’t known since 
he was ten. But, tiny as they 

10 



were, Miss Green and the 
princess primarily gave him 
the impression of being quite 
as functional as human beings 
or, perhaps, as field mice. 

He would have liked to in- 
spect the brittle-seeming 
wings more closely. They 
seemed to be made up of nu- 
merous laminated, very thin 
sections, and he wondered 
whether they could fly with 
them or whether their race 
had given up or lost that abil- 
ity. 

But touching them might 
have affected their present 
matter-of-fact acceptance of 
him, and he didn’t want to 
risk that . 

A door banged suddenly in 
the apartment overhead. A 
moment later, he heard Maria 
coming down the hall stairs. 

Mel stood up in sudden 
alarm. He’d known for some 
time that his neighbor had 
supplied herself with a key to 
his apartment, not to pry but 
with the practical purpose of 
borrowing from the little bar 
in Mel’s living room when she 
was out of both money and 
liquor. She rarely took much, 
and until now he’d been more 
amused than annoyed. 

H E went hurriedly into the 
living room, closing the 
door to the kitchenette behind 
him. If Maria knocked, he 
wouldn’t answer. If she de- 
cided he was out and came in 
to steal his liquor, he would 
pretend to have been asleep in 



JAMES H. SCHMITZ 




the chair and scare the hell out 
of her! 

She paused before the 
apartment door a moment, but 
then went out into the court. 

Mel waited until her foot- 
steps died away, going toward 
the street. As he opened the 
door to the kitchenette, some- 
thing buzzed noisily out of the 
living room past his shoulder 
— a big, unlovely looking 
horsefly. The apartment 
screens didn’t fit too well, and 
the fly probably had been at- 
tracted by the smell of food. 

Startled, he stopped to con- 
sider the new problem. There 
was a flyswatter hanging be- 
side the door, but he didn’t 
want to alarm his guests — and 
then, for the first time, he saw 
Miss Green’s wings unfold ! 

She was up on her feet be- 
side the princess, who remain- 
ed sitting on the towel. Both 
of them were following the 
swift, erratic course of the big 
fly with more animation than 
they’d shown about anything 
so far. 

Miss Green gave a sud- 
den piping cry, and the glassy 
appendages on her back open- 
ed out suddenly like twin 
transparently gleaming fans, 
and blurred into motion too 
swift for Mel to follow. 

Miss Green rose into the air 
like a tiny human helicopter, 
hands up before her as if she 
were praying. 

It wasn’t till the horsefly 
swerved from the kitchenette 
window and came buzzing 

SUMMER GUESTS 



back that Mel guessed her 
purpose. 

There was a sharper, fiercer 
drone like a hornet’s song as 
she darted sideways into the 
insect’s path. Mel didn’t see 
her catch it. Its buzzing sim- 
ply stopped, and then she was 
dropping gently back to the 
towel, with the ugly black 
thing between her hands. It 
looked nearly as big as her 
head. 

There was an exchange of 
cheerful piping cries between 
the two. Miss Green laughed 
up at Mel’s stupefied face, 
lifted the motionless fly to her 
mouth and neatly bit off its 
head. 

Mel turned hurriedly and 
went into the living room. It 
wasn’t, he told himself, really 
so very different from human, 
beings eating a chicken. But 
he didn’t feel up to watching 
what he knew was going to be 
a dismemberment and a feast. 

At any rate, the horsefly 
had settled the feeding prob- 
lem. His guests could take 
care of themselves. 

T HAT night, Miss Green 
hunted down a few moths. 
Mel woke up twice with the 
sudden sharp drone in his ears 
that told him she had just 
made her catch. Both times, 
it was a surge of unthinking 
physical fright that actually 
roused him. Awake, and re- 
membering the disproportion 
in size between himself and 
the huntress, his reaction 

11 




seemed ridiculous ; but the 
second time he found he was 
reluctant to go back to sleep 
until it would appear that 
Miss Green was done with her 
foraging. 

So he lay awake, listening 
to the occasional faint indica- 
tions of her continuing activ- 
ity within his apartment, and 
to more familiar sounds with- 
out. A train rattled over a 
crossing; a police siren gave 
a sudden view halloo and 
faded into silence again. For a 
long time, there was only the 
whispering passage of distant 
cars over wet pavements, and 
the slow roll and thump of the 
surf. A haze of fog beyond the 
window turned the apartment 
into a shut-off little world of 
its own. 

Miss Green moved about 
with no more than a whisper 
of air and the muted pipe of 
voices from -the top of the 
kitchenette cupboard to show 
where she was. Mel had put a 
small carton up there, uphol- 
stered with the towel and 
handkerchiefs and roofed over 
with his best woolen sweater, 
to make a temporary home for 
his guests. The princess hadn't 
stirred from it since, but Miss 
Green remained busy. 

He started suddenly to find 
her hovering directly over his 
bed, vaguely silhouetted 
against the pale blur of the 
window. As he stared, she set- 
tled down and came to rest on 
the blanket over his chest, 
effortlessly as a spider gliding 



down along its thread. Her 
wings closed with a faint 
snap. 

Mel raised his head careful- 
ly to squint down along the 
blanket at her. It was the first 
time either of them had made 
anything resembling a friend- 
ly advance in his direction ; he 
didn't want to commit any 
blunders. 

“Hello," he said quietly. 

Miss Green didn't reply. She 
seemed to be looking up at the 
window, disregarding him, 
and he was content to watch 
her. These strange creatures 
seemed to have some of the 
aloofness of cats in their man- 
ner, and they might be as 
easily offended. 

She turned presently, walk- 
ed up over the blanket and 
perched herself on Mel's pil- 
low, above his head and some- 
what to his right. And there 
she stayed silently. Which 
seemed catlike, too : the grant- 
ing of a reserved and tempo- 
rary companionship. He would 
not have been too surprised to 
hear a tiny purring from 
above his ear. Instead, drowsi- 
ly and lulled in an odd way by 
Miss Green's presence, he 
found himself sinking back 
into sleep. 

I T WASN'T surprising either 
that his mind should be fill- 
ed for a time with vague pic- 
tures of her, but when the 
room about him seemed to 
have expanded into something 
like a faintly luminous fish- 



12

bowl, he knew he was dream- 
ing. There were others 
present. They were going 
somewhere, and he had a sense 
of concern, which had to do 
either with their destination 
or with difficulties in getting 
there. Then a realization of 
swift, irrevocable disaster — 

There were violent lurch- 
ings as the luminosity about 
him faded swiftly into black- 
ness. He felt a terrible, en- 
ergy-draining cold, the wet 
clutch of death itself, then 
something like a soundless ex- 
plosion about him and an- 
guished cryings. The motion 
stopped. 

Blackness faded back to 
gray, but the cold remained. 
Icy water was pounding down 
on him now, as if he were 
fighting his way through a 
vertical current carrying 
somebody else. A desperate 
hunt for refuge — and finding 
it suddenly, and slipping in- 
side and relaxing into uncon- 
sciousness, to wait for the 
return of warmth and life . 

Mel’s eyes opened. The room 
was beginning to lighten with 
morning. He turned his head 
slowly to look for Miss Green. 
She was still there, on the pil- 
low beside his head, watching 
him ; and there was something 
in her position, in the unwink- 
ing golden eyes, even in her 
curious fluff of blue-white 
hair, that reminded him now 
less of a cat than a small 
lizard. 

He didn’t doubt that she 



had somehow enabled him to 
share the experience that in 
part explained their presence 
here. Without thinking* he 
asked aloud, “What happened 
to the others?” 

She didn’t move, but he was 
aware of a surge of horrified 
revulsion. Then before his 
open eyes for a moment swam 
a picture of a bleak, rain- 
beaten beach . and, just 
above the waterline, in a clus- 
ter of harsh voices, jabbing 
beaks and beating wings, 
great gulls were tearing apart 
a strange jetsam of tiny 
bodies too weakened to 
escape — 

A small, plaintive crying 
came from the kitchenette. 
The picture faded as Miss 
Green soared into the air to 
attend to her princess. 

M EL breakfasted in the liv- 
ing room, thoughtfully. 
He couldn’t quite understand 
that luminous vehicle of 
theirs, or why it should have 
succumbed to the rain storm 
of Saturday night, which ap- 
peared to be what had hap- 
pened. But his guests obvious- 
ly were confronted with the 
problem of getting back to 
wherever they’d come from — 
and he didn’t think Miss Green 
would have confided in him if 
he wasn’t somehow expected 
to be helpful in solving the 
problem. 

There was a thump on the 
sill outside his bedroom win- 
dow, followed by an annoyed 

13 



SUMMER GUESTS 




meowing. The gray cat that 
had been spying on the bird 
box seemed to suspect he was 
harboring the refugees. Mel 
went out into the little court- 
yard through the back door of 
the duplex and chased the ani- 
mal away. The fog, he saw, 
was thinning out quickly; in 
an hour or so it would be an- 
other clear day. 

When he came in, Miss 
Green fluted a few soft notes, 
which Mel chose to interpret 
as gratitude, from the top of 
the cupboard and withdrew 
from sight again. 

One couldn't think of them, 
he decided, as being exactly 
like any creatures of Earth. 
The cold rain had been very 
nearly deadly to them, if the 
memory Miss Green had 
transmitted to him was accu- 
rate — as destructive as it had 
been to their curious craft. 
Almost as if it could wash 
right through them, to drain 
vital energies from their 
bodies, while in the merely 
foggy air of last night she had 
seemed comfortable enough. 
It indicated different tolerance 
spans with more sharply de- 
fined limits. 

The thought came into his 
mind: 

Venus? 

It seemed possible, even if 
it left a lot to explain. Mel 
got up in sudden excitement 
and began to walk about the 
room. He knew not much was 
known about the second plan- 
et, but he had a conviction of 



beii*g right. It struck him he 
might be involved in an event 
of enormous historical signifi- 
cance. 

Then, stopping for a mo- 
ment before the window, he 
saw it — 

Apparently high in the gray 
sky overhead, a pale yellow 
circle moved, much smaller 
than the sun, but like the disk 
of the sun seen ghostlike 
through clouds. Instantly, an- 
other part of his dream be- 
came clear to him. 

E LOST his head. “Miss 
Green! Come here, 
quick!" 

A buzz, the swift drone of 
wings, and she was beside 
him, perching on his shoulder. 
Mel pointed. 

She gave a lamenting little 
cry of recognition. As if it had 
been a signal, the yellow circle 
darted sideways in a long 
streaking slant, and vanished. 
Miss Green fled to report to 
the princess, while Mel stayed 
at the window, and quickly 
returned to him again. Evi- 
dently she was both excited 
and distressed, and he won- 
dered what was wrong. If that 
apparition of pale light had 
been one of their vessels, as 
her behavior indicated, it 
seemed probable that its mis- 
sion was to hunt for survivors 
of the lost globe. 

Miss Green seemed either 
less sure of that, or less con- 
fident that the rescue would 
be easily effected. Some min-

utes later, she pointed to a 
different section of the sky, 
where the yellow circle — or 
another very like it — was now 
moving slowly about. Present- 
ly it vanished again, and when 
it reappeared for the second 
time, it was accompanied by 
two others. 

Meanwhile, Miss Green 
might have been transmitting 
some understanding of the 
nature of her doubts to Mel, 
because the ghostly vagrants 
now gave him an immediate 
impression of insubstantial- 
ity: not space-spanning lumi- 
nous globes but pictured 
shapes projected on the air. 
His theory of interplanetary 
travelers became suddenly 
much less probable. 

In the next few moments, 
the concept he was struggling 
with abruptly completed itself 
in his mind, so abruptly, in 
fact, that there was no longer 
any question that it had origi- 
nated with Miss Green. The 
rescue craft Mel thought he 
was seeing actually were just 
that. 

But the pictures in the 
sky were only signals to possi- 
ble survivors that help was 
approaching. The globes them- 
selves were elsewhere, groping 
their way blindly and danger- 
ously through strange dimen- 
sions that had nothing to do 
with the ones Mel knew. 

And they were still, in some 
manner his imagination did 
not even attempt to clarify, 
very, very “far away.” 

SUMMER GUESTS 



“T WAS wondering what 
you'd done with the bird 
box,” Maria de Guesgne ex- 
plained. “It's not there in the 
bush any more!” 

Mel told her annoyedly that 
the bird box had been dam- 
agd by the storm, and so he'd 
thrown it into the incinerator. 

“Well,” Maria said vaguely, 
“that's too bad.” Her hand- 
some dark eyes were shifting 
about his living room mean- 
while, not at all vaguely. Mel 
had left the apartment door 
partly open, and she had walk- 
ed right in on her way to the 
market. When she wasn't 
drinking or working herself 
up to a bout of creative paint- 
ing, which seemed to put her 
into a tranced sort of condi- 
tion, Maria was a highly ob- 
servant young woman. The 
question was now how to get 
her out of the apartment 
again before she observed 
more than he wanted her to. 

“How does it happen you're 
not at work on Monday after- 
noon?” she inquired, and set 
her shopping bag down on the 
armchair. 

Keeping one eye on the 
kitchenette door, Mel explain- 
ed about his vacation. Miss 
Green hadn't been in sight for 
almost an hour ; but he wasn't 
at all sure she mightn't come 
out to inspect the visitor, and 
the thought of Maria's proba- 
ble reactions was unnerving. 

“Two weeks?” Maria re- 
peated chattily. “It'll be fun 
having you around for two 

15 




weeks — unless you're going 
off to spend your vacation 
somewhere else. Are you?" 

“No,” Mel said. “I'm stay- 
ing here — ” 

And at that moment, Miss 
Green came in through the 
kitchenette door. 

At least, Mel assumed it was 
Miss Green. All he actually 
saw was a faint blur of mo- 
tion. It went through the 
living room, accompanied by a 
high-pitched hum, and vanish- 
ed behind Maria. 

“Good Lord!” she cried, 
whirling. “What's that? Oh!” 
The last was a shrill yelp. “It 
stung me!” 

M EL hadn't imagined Miss 
Green could move so fast. 
Rising and falling with furi- 
ous menace, the sound seemed 
to come from all points of the 
room at once, as Maria darted 
out of the apartment. Clutch- 
ing her shopping bag, Mel 
followed her out hastily and 
slammed the door behind 
them. He caught up with 
Maria in the court. 

She was rubbing herself 
angrily. 

“I'm not coming into that 
apartment again, Mel Arm- 
strong,” she announced, “un- 
til you've had it fumigated! 
That thing kept stinging me! 
What was it, anyway?” 

“A wasp, I guess.” Mel felt 
weak with relief. She hadn't 
really seen anything. “Here's 
your bag. I'll chase it out.” 
Maria stalked off, complain- 



ing about screens that didn't 
even protect people against 
giant wasps. 

Mel found the apartment 
quiet again and went into the 
kitchenette. Miss Green was 
poised on the top edge of the 
cupboard, a gold-eyed statu- 
ette of Victory, laughing down 
at him, the laminated wings 
spread and raised behind her 
like iridescent glass fans. Mel 
looked at her with a trace of 
uneasiness. She had some kind 
of small white bundle in her 
arms, and he wondered 
whether it concealed the 
weapon with which she'd 
stung Maria. 

“I don't think you should 
have done that,” he told her. 
“But she's gone now.” 

Looking rather pleased with 
herself, Miss Green glanced 
back over her shoulder and 
piped a few questioning notes 
to the princess. There was a 
soft reply, and she soared 
down to the table, folded her 
wings and knelt to lay the 
bundle gently down on it. She 
beckoned to Mel. 

Mel's eyes popped as she 
unfolded the bundle. Perhaps 
he really shouldn't have been 
surprisd. 

He was harboring four 
guests now — the princess had 
been safely delivered of twins. 

A T DUSK, Miss Green wid- 
ened the biggest slit in the 
bedroom screen a little more 
and slipped out to do her own 
kind of shopping, with a sec-

tion of one of Mel’s handker- 
chiefs to serve as a bag. 

Mel left the lights out and 
stayed at the window. He felt 
depressed, but didn’t quite 
know why — unless it was that 
so many odd things had hap- 
pened since Sunday morning 
that his mind had given up 
trying to understand them. 

He wasn’t really sure now, 
for example, whether he was 
getting occasional flash- 
glimpses of those circular lu- 
minous vessels plowing 
through another dimension 
somewhere, or whether he was 
half asleep and imagining it. 
Usually it was a momentary 
glow printed on the dark air 
at the edge of his vision, van- 
ishing before he could really 
look at it. 

He had a feeling they had 
managed to come a good deal 
closer during the day. Then 
he wondered briefly whether 
other people had been seeing 
strange light-shapes, too, and 
what they might have thought 
the glimpses were. 

Spots before their eyes, 
probably. 

Miss Green was back with 
a soft hum of wings, on the 
outer window sill, six feet 
from where he sat. She push- 
ed the knotted scrap of cloth 
through the screen. There was 
something inside it now; it 
caught for a moment on the 
wires. Mel started up to help, 
then checked himself, afraid 
of feeling some bug squirming 
desperately inside; and while 

SUMMER GUESTS 



he hesitated, she had shoved it 
through. She followed it, pick- 
ed it up again and flew off to 
the living room. After a mo- 
ment she returned with the 
empty cloth and went out 
again. 

She made eight such trips 
in the next hour, while night 
deepened outside and then be- 
gan to lighten as a half-moon 
shoved over the horizon. Mel 
must have dozed off several 
times; at least, he suddenly 
found himself coming awake, 
with the awareness that some- 
thing had just landed with a 
soft thump on the window 
sill outside. 

It wasn’t Miss Green. He 
saw a chunky shadow at one 
corner of the window, and 
caught the faintest glint of 
green eyes peering into the 
room. It was the cat from the 
courtyard. 

In the same moment, he 
heard the familiar faint hum, 
and Miss Green appeared at 
the opposite end of the sill. 

A fterward, Mei realized 

he’d simply sat there, stif- 
fening in groggy, sleep-dazed 
horror, as the cat-shadow 
lengthened and flowed swiftly 
toward the tiny humanoid fig- 
ure. Miss Green seemed to 
raise both arms over her head. 
A spark of brilliant blue glow- 
ed from her cupped hands and 
extended itself in an almost 
invisible thread of fire that 
stabbed against the cat’s fore- 
head. The cat yowled, swung 

17 




aside and leaped down into the 
court. 

Mel was on his feet, shak- 
ing violently, as Miss Green 
slipped in through the screen. 
He heard Maria open her win- 
dow upstairs to peer down in- 
to the court, where the cat was 
making low, angry sounds. 
Apparently it hadn’t been 
hurt, but no wonder Maria 
had suspected that afternoon 
she’d been stung by a wasp! 
Or that Miss Green’s insect 
victims never struggled, once 
she had caught them! 

He pulled down the shade 
and stood undecided in the 
dark, until he heard her pip- 
ing call from the living room. 
It was followed by an impa- 
tient buzzing about the stand- 
ing lamp in there, and Mel 
concluded correctly that he 
was supposed to turn on the 
light. 

He discovered her on the 
living room table, sorting out 
the plunder she had brought 
back. 

It wasn’t a pile of elec- 
trocuted insects, as he had ex- 
pected, but a puzzlingly com- 
monplace collection — little 
heaps of dry sand from the 
beach, some small white peb- 
bles, and a sizable bundle of 
thin twigs about two inches in 
length. Since she was disre- 
garding him, he shifted the 
lamp over to the table to see 
what this human-shaped light- 
ning bug from another dimen- 
sion was going to do next. 

That was the way he felt 

18 



about Miss Green at the mo- 
ment . 

What she did was to trans- 
port the twigs in two bundles 
to the top of the cupboard, 
where she left them with the 
princess. Then she came back 
and began to lay out a thin 
thread of white sand on the 
dark, polished surface of the 
table. 

Mel pulled up his armchair, 
poured himself a glass of 
brandy, lit a cigarette, and 
settled down to watch her. 

B Y THE time Miss Green 
indicated to him that she 
wanted the light turned out 
again, he had finished his sec- 
ond drink and was feeling 
rather benevolent. She had 
used up all her sand, and about 
a square foot of the table’s 
surface was covered now with 
a confusingly intricate maze 
of lines, into which she had 
placed white pebbles here and 
there. Some of the lines, Mel 
noticed, blended into each 
other, while others stopped 
abruptly or curved back on 
themselves. As a decorative 
scheme, it hardly seemed 
worthwhile. 

“Miss Green,” he told her 
thoughtfully, “I hope it makes 
sense to you. It doesn’t to me.” 
She piped imperiously, 
pointing: the light! Mel had 
a moment of annoyance at the 
way she was ordering him 
around in his own apartment. 

“Well,” he said, “I’ll humor 
you this time.” 

JAMES H. SCHMITZ 




For a moment after he had 
pulled the switch, he stood be- 
side the table to let his eyes 
adjust to the dark. However, 
they weren’t adjusting prop- 
erly — a patch of unquiet phos- 
phorescent glimmering floated 
disturbingly within his field of 
vision, and as the seconds 
passed, it seemed to be grow- 
ing stronger. 

Suddenly, Mel swore in 
amazement and bent down to 
examine the table. 

“Now what have you 
done — ?” he began. 

Miss Green fluted soothing- 
ly at him from the dark and 
fluttered up to his shoulder. 
He felt a cool touch against 
his ear and cheek, and a burst 
of oddly pleasant tinglings ran 
over his scalp. 

“Stop that!” he said, star- 
tled. 

Miss Green fluted again, 
urgently. She was trying to 
tell him something now, and 
suddenly he thought he under- 
stood. 

“All right,” he said. “I’ll 
look at it. That’s what you 
want me to do, isn’t it?” 

Miss Green flew down to the 
table again, which indicated 
agreement. Mel groped him- 
self back into the chair and 
leaned forward to study the 
curiously glowing design she 
had created of sand and peb- 
bles. 

He discovered immediately 
that any attempt to see it 
clearly merely strained his 
vision. Details turned into 



vaguely distorted, luminous 
flickerings when he stared at 
them, and the whole pale, 
spidery pattern made no more 
sense than it had with the 
light on. She must have some 
purpose in mind with it, but 
Mel couldn’t imagine what. 

Meanwhile, Miss Green was 
making minor adjustments in 
his position which Mel accept- 
ed without argument, since 
she seemed to know what she 
was doing. Small tugs and 
pushes told him she wanted 
his hands placed on the table 
to either side of the design. 
Mel put them there. His head 
was to be tilted forward just 
so. He obliged her again. Then 
she was back on the table, and 
the top two-thirds of the pat- 
tern vanished suddenly behind 
a blur. 

After a moment, he realized 
she had opened her wings and 
blotted that part from his 
sight. 

I N THE darkness, he fasten- 
ed his puzzled gaze on the 
remaining section: a quiver- 
ing, thinly drawn pattern of 
blue-white light that faded pe- 
riodically almost to the limits 
of visibility and slowly grew 
up again to what was, by com- 
parison, real brilliance. His 
head was aching slightly. The 
pattern seemed to tilt side- 
ways and move upward, as if 
it were creeping in a slow cir- 
cle about some pivot-point. 
Presently, it turned down 
again to complete the circle 



SUMMER GUESTS

and start on another round. 
By that time, the motion 
seemed normal. 

When a tiny shape of light 
suddenly ran across the design 
and vanished again as it 
reached the other side, Mel 
was only moderately sur- 
prised. The figure had remind- 
ed him immediately of Miss 
Green. After a while, it cross- 
ed his field of vision in another 
direction, and then there were 
two more . 

He seemed to be swimming 
forward, through the pattern, 
into an area of similar tiny 
figures like living silhouettes 
of light, and of entrancingly 
delicate architectural designs. 
It was like a marionette set- 
ting of incredible craftsman- 
ship, not quite real in the 
everyday sense, but as con- 
vincing as a motion picture 
which was spreading out, sec- 
ond by second, and beginning 
to flow about him — 

“Hey!” Mel sat up with a 
start. “You’re trying to hyp- 
notize me!” 

Miss Green piped pleading- 
ly. Clearly, she had only been 
trying to show him something. 
And wasn’t it beautiful? 
Didn’t he want to see more? 

Mel hesitated. He was sus- 
picious now, but he was also 
curious. After all, what could 
she do to him with her tricks ? 

Besides, he admitted to him- 
self, the picture had vanished 
as soon as he shifted his eyes, 
and it was beautiful, like mov- 
ing about through a living 

20 



illustration of a book of fairy 
tales 

He yielded. “All right, I do 
want to see more.” 

This time, the picture grew 
up out of the design within 
seconds. Only it wasn’t the 
same picture. It was as if he 
had turned around and was 
looking in another direction, 
a darker one. 

There were fewer of the 
little light-shapes ; instead, he 
discovered in the distance a 
line of yellow dots that moved 
jerkily but steadily, like glow- 
ing corks bobbing on dark 
water. He watched them for 
a moment without recogni- 
tion; then he realized with a 
thrill of pleasure that he was 
getting another view of the 
luminous globes he had seen 
before — this time an other- 
dimensional view, so to speak. 

Suddenly, one of them was 
right before him! Not a dot or 
a yellow circle, but a three- 
foot ball of fire that rushed to- 
ward him through the black- 
ness with hissing, sputtering 
sounds ! 

Mel surged up out of the 
chair with a yelp of fright, 
and the fireball vanished. 

As he groped about for the 
light, Miss Green was piping 
furiously at him from the 
table. 

Then the light came on. 

S HE was in a rage. Dancing 
about on the table, beating 
the air with her wings, she 
waved her arms over her head 



JAMES H. SCHMITZ 




and shook her tiny fists at 
him. Mel backed off warily. 

‘Take it easy!” he warned. 
He could reach the flyswatter 
in the kitchenette with a jump 
if she started shooting off 
miniature electric bolts again. 

She might have had the 
same idea, because she calmed 
down suddenly, shook her 
wings together and closed 
them with a snap. It was like 
a cat smoothing down its bris- 
tling back fur. There was a 
whistling query from the prin- 
cess now, followed by an ex- 
cited elfin conversation. 

Mel poured himself a drink 
with a hand that shook slight- 
ly, and pretended to ignore the 
disturbance of his guests, 
while he tried to figure out 
what had happened. 

Supposing, he thought a 
trifle guiltily, settling down 
on the couch at a safe distance 
from the table — supposing 
they simply had to have his 
help at this point. The manner 
in which one of the rescue 
globes suddenly had seemed to 
shift close to him suggested it. 
Was he justified in refusing 
to go on with it? In the direc- 
tionless dark through which 
the globes were driving, they 
might have been reacting to 
his concentrated awareness of 
them as if it were a radio sig- 
nal from the human dimen- 
sions. And it would explain 
Miss Green's rage at the sud- 
den interruption of the con- 
tact. 

But another thought came 



to him then, and his guilty 
feelings vanished in a surge of 
alarmed indignation. 

Well, and just supposing, he 
thought, that he hadn't broken 
the contact. And that a three- 
foot sputtering fireball mate- 
rialized right inside his living 
room! 

He caught sight of Miss 
Green eying him speculatively 
and rather slyly from the 
table. She seemed composed 
enough now; there was even 
the faintest of smiles on that 
tiny face. The smile seemed to 
confirm his suspicions. 

Mel downed his drink and 
stood up. 

“Miss Green,” he told her 
evenly, choosing his words 
with care, “I’m sorry to dis- 
appoint you, but I don't intend 
to be the subject of any more 
of your experiments. At least 
not until I've had time to 
think about it.” 

Her head nodded slightly, as 
if she were acknowledging his 
decision. But the smile re- 
mained; in fact, Miss Green 
had begun to look rather 
smug. Mel studied her un- 
easily. She might be planning 
to put something else over on 
him, but he knew how to stop 
that ! 

Before he turned out the 
light and went to bed, Mel 
methodically and somewhat 
grimly swallowed four more 
shots of brandy. With that 
much inside him, it wouldn't 
matter what Miss Green tried, 
because he wouldn't be able to

react to her suggestions till he 
woke up again in the morning. 

A CTUALLY it was noon be- 
fore he awoke — and he 
might have gone on sleeping 
then if somebody hadn’t been 
banging on his apartment 
door. 

“Wake up, Mel!” he heard 
Maria de Guesgne shouting 
hoarsely. “I can hear you snor- 
ing in there !” 

He sat up a little groggily 
and looked at the clock. His 
guests weren’t in sight. 

“You awake, Mel?” she de- 
manded. 

“Wait a minute!” he yelled 
back. “Just woke up and I’m 
not decent.” 

When he opened the door, 
she had vanished. He was 
about to close it quietly and 
gratefully again, when she 
called down the stairway. 
“That you, Mel? Come on up! 
I want to show you some- 
thing.” 

He locked the door behind 
him and went upstairs. Maria 
received him beamingly in her 
living room. She was on one 
of her rare creative painting 
sprees, and this spree, to 
judge by the spattered ap- 
pearance of the room and the 
artist, was more riotous than 
usual. A half dozen fair-sized 
canvases were propped on 
newspapers against the wall 
to dry. They were turned 
around, to increase the shock 
effect on Mel when he would 
get his first look at them. 



“Ever see a salamander?” 
Maria inquired with anticipa- 
tion, spreading a few more 
papers on the table. 

Mel admitted he hadn’t. He 
wished she’d given him time 
to have coffee first. His com- 
ments at these private show- 
ings were ususally regarded as 
inadequate anyway. 

“Well,” Maria invited tri- 
umphantly, selecting one of 
the canvases and setting it 
abruptly up on the table be- 
fore him, “take a look at one !” 

Mel gasped and jerked back. 
“Holy Judas!” he said in a 
weak voice. 

“Pretty good, eh?” For 
once, Maria appeared satisfied 
with his reaction. She held it 
away from her and regarded 
it. “One of my best!” she cried 
judiciously. 

About three times life-size, 
it was a quite recognizable 
portrait of Miss Green. 

I T DIDN’T occur to Maria to 
offer Mel coffee but he got 
a cigarette from her. Fortu- 
nately, he wasn’t called upon 
to make any more comments ; 
she chattered away while she 
showed him the rest of the 
series. Mel looked and listen- 
ed, still rather shaken. Pres- 
ently he began to ask ques- 
tions. 

A salamander, he learned, 
was a fire elemental. Maria 
glanced at her fireplace as she 
explained this, and Mel no- 
ticed she seemed to have had 
a fire burning there overnight, 



22

which wasn’t too unusual for 
her even in the middle of sum- 
mer. Listening to the bang- 
haired, bright-eyed oddball 
rattling off metaphysical de- 
tails about salamanders, he 
became aware of a sort of 
dread growing up in him. For 
Miss Green was pictured, 
wings and arms spread, 
against and within furling 
veils of yellow-white flame . 

“Drawn from life?” he in- 
quired, grinning to make it a 
joke. He pointed at the pic- 
ture. 

Without looking directly at 
her, he saw Maria start at the 
question. She stared at him in- 
tensely for a moment, and 
after that she became more 
reticent. 

It didn’t matter because it 
was all on the canvases. She 
had seen as much as he had 
and more, and put it down 
with shocking realism. Seen 
through somebody else’s eyes, 
Miss Green’s world was still 
beautiful ; but now it was also 
frightening. And there was 
what Maria had said about 
salamanders. 

“Maria,” he said, “what ac- 
tually happened last night?” 

She looked at him sullenly. 
“I don’t know what you’re 
talking about, Mel.” 

“I imagine,” he suggested 
casually, “you were just sit- 
ting there in front of the fire. 
And then — ” 

“Gosh, Mel, she was beauti- 
ful! It’s all so beautiful, you 
know ...” She recovered 



quickly. “I fell asleep and I 
had a dream, that’s all. Why? 
What makes you ask?” 

She was beginning to look 
rather wild-eyed, but he had 
to find out. “I was just won- 
dering,” he said, “whether 
they’d left.” 

“Why should they leave — 
Look, you oaf ! I called you in 
to give you the privilege of 
looking at my paintings. Now 
get out. I’ve got to make a 
phone call.” 

He stopped at the door, 
struck by a sudden suspicion. 
“You’re not going to try to sell 
them, are you?” 

“Try to sell them!” She 
laughed hoarsely. “There are 
circles, Mel Armstrong, in 
which a de Guesgne original 
is understood, shall we' say? 
Circles not exactly open to the 
common herd . This series,” 
she concluded, rather prosai- 
cally, “will get me two thou- 
sand bucks as soon as I let one 
or two of the right people have 
a look at them !” 

B rewing himself a pot of 

coffee at last, Mel decided 
that part of it, if true, wasn’t 
any of his business. He had 
always assumed Maria was 
living on a monthly check she 
got from an unidentified 
source in Chicago, but her oc- 
casional creations might have 
a well-heeled following, at 
that. As for the way Miss 
Green had got in to sit for her 
portrait — the upstairs screens 
weren’t in any better shape 



SUMMER GUESTS 



23 




than the downstairs ones. The 
fiery background, of course, 
might have been only in 
Maria's mind. 

There was a scratching on 
top of the cupboard and whis- 
pery voices. Mel ignored the 
slight chill that drifted down 
his spine. Up to that moment, 
he’d been hoping secretly that 
Maria had provided a beacon 
for the rescue team to home 
in on while he slept, and that 
his guests had been picked up 
and taken home. 

But Miss Green was peer- 
ing down at him over the edge 
of the cupboard. 

“Hi, salamander!” he greet- 
ed her politely. “Had a busy 
night? Too bad it didn’t 
work.” 

Her head withdrew. In the 
living room Mel stopped to 
look at the design of sand and 
pebbles, which was still on the 
table. Touching one of the 
threadlike lines, he discovered 
it was as hard and slick as 
lacquer. Otherwise the pattern 
seemed unremarkable in day- 
light, but Mel dropped a cloth 
across it to keep it out of 
sight. 

Miss Green fluttered past 
him to the sill of the bedroom 
window. He watched her 
standing on tiptoe against the 
screen, apparently peering 
about at the sky. After a 
while, it began to seem ridicu- 
lous to let himself become ob- 
sessed by superstitious fears 
about this tiny and beautiful, 
almost jewellike creature.

Whatever abilities she might 
have, she and the princess 
were only trying to get home 
— and, having seen their 
home, he couldn’t blame them 
for that. 

He had a return of the 
fairy-tale nostalgia his 
glimpse of those eerily beauti- 
ful places had aroused in him 
the night before, a pleasantly 
yearning sensation like an 
awareness of elfin horns blow- 
ing far away to send faint, 
exciting echoes swirling about 
the commonplace sky of 
Sweetwater Bay. The feeling 
might have been resurrected 
from his childhood, but it was 
a strong and effective one. 

He recalled how bored he’d 
been with everything before 
they appeared . 

He walked softly through 
the bedroom and stopped be- 
hind Miss Green. She was 
making an elaborate pretense 
of not having noticed his ap- 
proach, but the pointed ears 
that could follow the passage 
of a moth in the dark were 
tilted stiffly backward. Mel 
actually was opening his 
mouth to say, “Miss Green, 
I’ll help you if I can,” when it 
struck him sharply, like a 
brand-new thought, that it 
was an extremely rash prom- 
ise to make, considering 
everything that had happened 
so far. 

He wondered how the odd 
impulse ever had come to him. 

In sudden suspicion, he be- 
gan to trace the last few min- 



JAMES H. SCHMITZ 




utes through again. He had 
started with a firm decision 
not to let his guests involve 
him in their plans any more 
than was healthy for him, if 
at all — and the decision had 
been transformed, step by 
step, and mental twist by men- 
tal twist, into a foolish will- 
ingness to have them make 
use of him exactly as they 
pleased ! 

Miss Green, still maliciously 
pretending to watch the sky, 
let him think it all out until it 
became quite clear what she 
had done and how she had 
done it. And then, as Mel 
spluttered angrily at this lat- 
est interference with his free- 
dom of thought and action, 
she turned around and laughed 
at him. 

I N A way, it cleared the air. 

The pressure was off. Ma- 
ria had proved a much more 
pliable subject than Mel; the 
rescuers had their bearings 
and would arrive presently. 
Meanwhile, everybody could 
relax. 

Mel couldn’t help feeling re- 
lieved as he grew sure of that. 
At the same time, now that 
the departure was settled, he 
became aware of a certain 
amount of belated regret. Miss 
Green didn’t seem to know the 
exact hour; she was simply 
watching for them well ahead 
of their arrival. 

Where would they show up ? 
She waved her arms around 
in an appealingly helpless ges- 



ture at the court outside and 
the sky. Here, there — some- 
where in the area. 

It would be a fire globe. At 
his question, she pointed at the 
opposite wall of the court 
where a picture of one formed 
itself obligingly, slid along the 
wall a few feet, and vanished. 
Mel was beginning to enjoy 
all this easy last-minute com- 
munication, when he heard 
Maria come downstairs and 
open the door to the other 
court. There was conversa- 
tion, and several sets of foot- 
steps went up to her apart- 
ment and down again. 

Cautioning Miss Green, he 
took a look around the shut- 
ters of the living room win- 
dow. A small panel truck stood 
in the court ; Maria was super- 
vising the careful transfer of 
her paintings into its interior. 
Apparently she didn’t even in- 
tend to let them dry before 
offering them for sale! 

The truck drove off with 
Maria inside with her paint- 
ings, and Mel discovered Miss 
Green doing a little spying of 
her own from the upper edge 
of the shutters. Good friends 
now, they smiled at each other 
and resumed their guard at 
the bedroom window. 

The princess joined them 
around five in the afternoon. 
Whether she had been injured 
in the accident or weakened 
by the birth of her babies, Mel 
couldn’t tell, but Miss Green 
carried her friend down from 
the cupboard without visible

effort, and then went back for 
a globular basket of tightly 
woven tiny twigs, which con- 
tained the twins. 

It was a masterfully design- 
ed little structure with a single 
opening about the thickness of 
a pencil, and heavily lined. 
Mel had a notion to ask for it 
as a souvenir, but decided 
against it. He lifted it care- 
fully to his ear, to listen to an 
almost inaudible squeaking in- 
side, and his expression seem- 
ed to cause Miss Green con- 
siderable silent amusement. 

All in all, it was much like 
waiting patiently in pleasant 
company for the arrival of an 
overdue train. Then, around 
seven o'clock, when the room 
was already dark, the tele- 
phone rang abruptly and re- 
turned Mel with a start to the 
world of human beings. 

He lifted the receiver. 

“Hello, oaf!" said Maria de 
Guesgne in what seemed for 
the moment to be an enor- 
mous, booming voice. 

Mel inquired agreeably 
whether she'd succeeded in 
selling her paintings. It was 
the first thing that occurred 
to him. 

“Certainly I sold them!" 
Maria said. He could tell by 
now that she was thoroughly 
plastered again. “Got a mes- 
sage to give you," she added. 

“From whom?" 

“Maybe from me, ha-ha!" 
said Maria. She paused a mo- 
ment, seemed to be muttering 
something to herself, and re- 

26 



sumed suddenly, “Oaf, are you 
listening?" 

Mel said bluntly that he 
was. If he hung up on her, she 
would probably ring back. 

“All right," Maria said 
clearly. “This is the message : 
‘The fiery ones do not tolerate 
the endangering of their se- 
crets.' Warning, see? Goo'- 
bye." 

She hung up before he could 
say anything. 

H ERS had been a chilling 
sort of intrusion. Mel 
stood a while in the darkening 
room, trying to gather up the 
mood Maria had shattered, 
and discovering he couldn't 
quite do it. He realized that all 
along, like a minor theme, 
there had been a trace of fear 
underlying everything he did, 
ever since he had first looked 
into that bird box and 
glimpsed something impossi- 
ble inside it. He had been cov- 
ering -the fear up; even now 
he didn't want to admit it, but 
it was there. 

He could quite simply, of 
course, walk out of the room 
and out of the apartment, and 
stay away for a week. He 
didn't even ever have to come 
back. And, strictly speaking, 
this was the sort of thing that 
should have happened to some- 
body like Maria de Guesgne, 
not to him. For him, the sensi- 
ble move right now would be 
to go quietly back into the nor- 
mal world of reality he had 
stepped out of a few morn- 

JAMES H. SCHMITZ 




ings ago. It was a simple phys- 
ical act. The door was over 
there . 

Then Mel looked back at his 
guests and promptly reversed 
his decision. They were cer- 
tainly as real as any living 
creatures he’d ever seen, and 
he felt there weren’t many hu- 
man beings who would show 
up as well as Miss Green had 
done in any comparable emer- 
gency. His own unconscious 
fears meant only that he had 
run into a new and unpredic- 
table factor in a world that 
had been becoming increasing- 
ly commonplace for a number 
of years now. He could see 
that once you’d got settled in- 
to the idea of a commonplace 
world, you might be startled 
by discoveries that didn’t fit 
that notion — and he felt now, 
rather hazily, that it wasn’t 
such a bad thing to be startled 
like that. It might wake you 
up enough to let you start liv- 
ing again yourself. 

He took the receiver off the 
phone and laid it on the floor, 
so there wouldn’t be any more 
interruptions. If he ran off 
now before seeing how the 
adventure ended, he knew he 
would never quit regretting it. 

He went into the bedroom 
and pulled his chair back up 
to the window. The shadowy 
sihouette that was Miss Green 
turned and sounded a few flut- 
ing notes at him. He had the 
immediate impression that she 
was worried. 

What was the matter? 



She pointed. 

Clouds ! 

T HE sky was still full of the 
pastel glowings of the sun- 
set. Here and there were 
patches of black cloud, insig- 
nificant-looking, like ragged 
crows swimming through the 
pale light. 

“Rain,” the thought came. 
“The cold rain — the killing 
rain! Another storm!” 

Mel studied the sky uneasi- 
ly. They might be right. “Your 
friends are bound to get here 
first,” he assured them, look- 
ing confident about it. 

They smiled gratefully at 
him. He couldn’t think of any- 
thing he might do to help. The 
princess looked comfortable 
on the towel he had laid along 
the screen, and Miss Green, as 
usual, looked alert, prepared 
to handle anything that had to 
be handled. He wondered 
about asking her to let him 
see how the globes were doing, 
and, instantly, a thought 
showed clear in his mind : 
“Try it yourself!” 

That hadn’t occurred to Mel 
before. He settled back com- 
fortably in the chair and look- 
ed through the screen for 
them. 

Four or five fiery visualiza- 
tions quivered here and there 
in the air, vanished, reappear- 
ed, vanished . 

Mel stopped looking for 
them, and there was only the 
sky. 

“Closer?” he said aloud, 

27 



SUMMER GUESTS 




rather pleased with himself. It 
had been easy ! 

Miss Green nodded, human 
fashion, and piped something 
in reply. Closer, but — 

He gathered she couldn’t 
tell from here how close, and 
that there was trouble — a not 
quite translatable kind of 
trouble, but almost as if, in 
their dimension, they were 
struggling through the radi- 
ant distortions of a storm that 
hadn’t gathered yet here on 
Earth. 

He glanced up at the sky 
again, more anxiously now. 
The black clouds didn’t seem 
to have grown any larger. 

B Y AND by, because he had 
not had any awareness of 
going to sleep, Mel was sur- 
prised to find himself waking 
up. He knew immediately that 
he had been asleep a long time, 
a period of hours. There was 
grayness around him, the 
vague near-light of very early 
morning, and he had a sense 
of having been aroused by a 
swirling confusion of angry 
sounds. But all was silent at 
the moment. 

Her answer was instantly 
in his mind. The storm had 
caused a delay — but a great 
globe was almost here now ! 

A curious pause followed. 
Mel had a sense of hesitation. 
And then, very swiftly and 
faintly, a wisp of thought, 
which he would have missed 
if that pause had not made 
him alert, showed and vanish- 

28 



ed on the fringe of his con- 
sciousness : 

“Be careful! Be very care- 
ful” 

Miss Green turned back to 
the window. Beside her now, 
Mel saw the princess sitting 
as if asleep, with one arm 
across the twig basket and her 
head resting on her arm. Be- 
fore he could frame the puz- 
zled question that was strug- 
gling up in his mind, there 
was a series of ear-splitting 
yowls from the court outside. 
It startled Mel only for a mo- 
ment, since it was a familiar 
sort of racket. The gray cat 
didn’t tolerate intruding fe- 
lines in its area, and about 
once a month it discovered 
and evicted one with the same 
lack of inhibition it was evi- 
dencing right now. It must 
have been the threatening 
squalls which usually preceded 
the actual battle that had 
awakened him. 

The encounter itself was 
over almost instantly. There 
were sounds of a scampering 
retreat which ended beyond 
the garage, and, standing up 
at the window, Mel saw the 
gray shape of the winner come 
gliding back down the court. 
The cat stopped below him 
and seemed to turn up its 
head. For a moment, he felt it 
was staring both at him and 
at Miss Green, very much like 
a competent little tiger in the 
gusty, gray night; then it 
made a low, menacing sound 
and moved on out of sight. Ap- 



JAMES H. SCHMITZ 




parently it hadn’t yet forgot- 
ten its previous meeting with 
Miss Green. 

Mel looked down at her. 
“Why should I be careful?” 

There was a pause again, 
and what came then hardly 
seemed an answer to his ques- 
tion. The princess was very 
weak, Miss Green indicated; 
he might have to help. 

He was still wondering 
about that — and wondering, 
too, whether he’d really had 
something like a warning 
from her — when a sudden 
wavering glare lit up the room 
behind them! 

For a moment, he thought 
the fireball was inside the 
building. But the light was 
pouring in through the living 
room window; its source was 
in the opposite court, out of 
his line of sight. There was a 
crackling, hissing sound, and 
the light faded. 

Miss Green came darting at 
him. Mel put his hand up in- 
stinctively and felt her thrust 
the basket into it. Almost in- 
stantly, she had picked up the 
princess and was outside the 
screen — 

Then the cat attacked from 
below in a silent, terrible leap, 
a long, twisting shadow in the 
air, and they seemed to drop 
out of sight together. 

M EL was out in the court, 
staring wildly around. In 
the swimming grayness noth- 
ing stirred or made sound. A 
cool, moist wind thrust at his 

SUMMER GUESTS 



face and faded. Except for the 
toy basket of twigs in his 
hand, he might have been 
awakening from a meaning- 
less dream. 

Then a lurid round of light 
like a big, wavering moon 
came out over the top of the 
building, and a sharp hum- 
ming sound drove down 
through the air at him. In- 
stinctively again, he held out 
the basket and felt it plucked 
away. He thought it was Miss 
Green, but the shape had come 
and gone much too swiftly to 
be sure of that. 

The light grew brilliant, a 
solid white — intolerable — and 
he backed hurriedly into the 
shelter of' the garage, his 
heart hammering in excite- 
ment and alarm. He heard 
voices from the other court ; a 
window slammed somewhere. 
He couldn’t guess what was 
happening, but he didn’t need 
Miss Green’s warning now. 
He had an overwhelming urge 
to keep out of sight until the 
unearthly visitor would be 
gone — 

And then, running like a 
rabbit, the gray cat appeared 
from behind a box halfway 
down the court and came 
streaking for the garage. Mel 
watched its approach with a 
sort of silent horror, partly 
because it might be attracting 
undesirable attention to him 
— and partly because he seem- 
ed to know in that instant ex- 
actly what was going to be 
done to it. 

29 




It wasn't more than twenty 
feet away when something 
like a twisting string of fiery 
white reached down from 
above. The animal leaped side- 
ways, blazed and died. There 
was a sound very like a gun- 
shot, and the court was in- 
stantly dark. 

Mel stayed where he was. 
For half a minute or so, he 
was shaking much too violent- 
ly to have left his retreat. By 
the end of that time, he knew 
better. It wasn't over yet ! 

Pictures forming in the 
moist, dark air . delicate, 
unstable outlines sliding 
through the court, changing 
as they moved. Elfin castles 
swayed up out of grayness and 
vanished again. Near the edge 
of his vision other shapes 
showed, more beautiful than 
human . 

Muttering to himself, be- 
tween terror and delight, Mel 
closed his eyes as tightly as he 
could, which helped for a mo- 
ment. But then the impres- 
sions began drifting through 
his mind. The visitors were 
still nearby, hanging some- 
where outside the limits of hu- 
man sight in their monstrous 
fireball, in the windy sky. 
They were talking to him in 
their way. 

Mel asked in his mind what 
they wanted, and the answer 
showed immediately. The 
table in his living room with 
the pattern of glassy sand and 
pebbles Miss Green had con- 
structed. The pattern was 

30 



glowing again now under the 
cloth he had thrown over it. 
He was to go in and look at 
the pattern . 

“No!” he said aloud. It was 
all terror now. 

“Go look at the pattern . 
Go look at the pattern . .” 
The pictures burst round 
him in a soundless wild flow- 
ering of beauty, flickering 
rains of color, a fountain of 
melting, shifting forms. His 
mind drowned in happiness. 
He was sinking through a 
warmth of kindness, gratitude 
and love . 

A DRIFT of rain touched his 
cheek coldly — and Mel 
found himself outside the ga- 
rage, moving drunkenly to- 
ward the apartment door. 
Then, just for a moment, a 
picture of Miss Green printed 
itself on his mind. 

She seemed to be standing 
before him, as tall now as he 
was, motionless, the strange 
wings half spread. The golden 
unhuman eyes were looking 
past him, watching something 
with cold malice and contempt 
— and with a concentration of 
purpose that made a death's 
mask of the perfectly chiseled 
green face ! 

In that second, Mel under- 
stood the purpose as clearly 
as if she had told him. In the 
next, the image disappeared 
with a jerky, complete abrupt- 
ness — 

As if somebody were be- 
latedly trying to wipe it out 



JAMES H. SCHMITZ 




of his memory as well ! But he 
knew he had seen her some- 
how — somewhere — as she ac- 
tually was at that moment. 
And he knew what she had 
been watching. Himself, Mel 
Armstrong, staggering blindly 
about in his other-dimension, 
down in the court ! 

He hadn't stayed in the 
court. He was back in the ga- 
rage, backed trembling against 
a wall. She — they — weren't 
trying to show him gratitude, 
or reward him somehow; be- 
fore they left, they simply 
wanted to destroy the human 
being who had found out 
about them, and whom they 
had used. The table and the 
pattern were some sort of 
trap ! What he couldn't under- 
tand was why they didn't 
simply come down in their 
fireball and kill him as they 
had the cat. 

They were still pouring 
their pictures at him, but he 
knew now how to counteract 
that. He stared out through 
the garage window at the 
lightening sky — looked at, lis- 
tened to, what was there, fill- 
ing his mind with Earth 
shapes and sounds ! 

And he promptly discovered 
an ally he hadn't been count- 
ing on. He hadn't really been 
aware of the thumping wind 
before, and the sketchy pat- 
tering of raindrops, like a 
sweeping fall of leaves here 
and there. He hadn't even 
heard, beyond the continuous 
dim roar of surf from the 



beach, the gathering mutter 
of thunder ! 

They couldn't stay here 
long. The storm was ready to 
break. They weren't willing to 
risk coming out fully into the 
Earth dimension to hunt him 
down. And he didn't have to 
go to their trap . 

Rain spattered louder and 
closer. The sweat chilled on 
Mel's body as his breathing 
grew quieter. They hadn't left 
him yet. If he relaxed his eyes 
and his mind, there was an 
instant faint recurrence of the 
swirling unearthly patterns. 
But he could keep them out by 
looking at what was really 
here. He only had to wait — 

Then the rain came down in 
a great, rushing tide, and he 
knew they were gone. 

F OR a few seconds, he re- 
mained where he was, 
weak with relief. Over the 
noise of the storm, he heard 
human voices faintly from the 
other court and from neigh- 
boring houses. That final 
crash must have awakened 
everybody — and someone had 
seen the great globe of fire 
when it first appeared. 

There should be some inter- 
esting gossip in the morning! 

Which concerned Mel not at 
all. After drinking in the 
sweet certainty of being still 
alive and safe, he had become 
aware of an entirely unex- 
pected emotion, which was, 
curiously, a brief but sharp 
pang of grief at Miss Green's 



SUMMER GUESTS 



31 




betrayal. Why, he must have 
been practically in love with 
that other-dimensional, hu- 
man-shaped rattlesnake ! Mull- 
ing it over in moody amaze- 
ment at himself, it struck Mel 
suddenly then that one could 
interpret her final action 
somewhat differently, too. 

Because she could have 
planted that apparently re- 
vealing picture of herself de- 
liberately in his mind, to stop 
him from stumbling into the 
trap the others had set for 
him ! She might have been 
planning to save him from the 
beginning, or merely relented 
at the last moment. There was 
no way of ever really knowing 
now, but Mel found he prefer- 
red to believe that Miss 
Green's intention was good. 

In the driving rain, he hesi- 
tated a moment beside the 
blackened lump that had been 
the cat, but he couldn't force 
himself to pick it up and re- 
move it. If someone else found 
it, it might add to the gossip, 
but that wasn't any business 
of his any more. Everyone 
knew that lightning did fun- 
ny, selective things. So far as 
he was concerned, the matter 
was all over. 

He opened the duplex door 
and stood staring. 

His apartment door was 
open and the room beyond was 
dark, as he had left it. But 
down the little stairway and 
out of Maria's upstairs apart- 
ment, light poured in a quiet 
flood. 



S HE must have returned 
during the night while he 
was sleeping, probably drunk 
as a hoot-owl. The commo- 
tion downstairs hadn't been 
enough to arouse her. But 
something else had — she’d 
come down following swirling, 
beautiful, unearthly pictures, 
hunting the pattern that 
would guide her straight into 
a promised delight! 

Mel didn't have to reach in- 
to the apartment to switch on 
the light. Lightning did fun- 
ny, selective things, all right, 
and from where he stood, he 
could smell what had happen- 
ed. They hadn't wasted that 
final bolt, after all ! 

Oddly enough, what was 
uppermost in his mind in 
those seconds, while he con- 
tinued to p,ut off seeing what 
he was going to have to look 
at very soon, was the final 
awareness of how he must 
have appeared in their eyes: 
A stupid native, barely ca- 
pable of receiving training 
and instruction enough to be 
a useful servant. Beyond that, 
they had simply had no inter- 
est in him. 

It was Maria they had wor- 
ried about. The mental im- 
pressions he'd picked up in the 
court had been directed at her. 
Miss Green had been obliged 
to stop him finally from 
springing a trap which was 
set for another. 

For Maria, who might have 
endangered their leaving.

FAIR 

GAME 

No question of it, Douglas 



was a prize catch . btit by 



whom . and for what? 



P ROFESSOR Anthony 

Douglas lowered grateful- 
ly into his red-leather easy 
chair and sighed. A long sigh, 
accompanied by labored re- 
moval of his shoes and numer- 
ous grunts as he kicked them 
into the corner. He folded his 
hands across his ample middle 
and lay back, eyes closed. 



“Tired?" Laura Douglas 
asked, turning from the kitch- 
en stove a moment, her dark 
eyes sympathetic. 

“You're darn right." Doug- 
las surveyed the evening 
paper across from him on the 
couch. Was it worth it? No, 
not really. He felt around in 
his coat pocket for his ciga- 



33 




rettes and lit up slowly, lei- 
surely. “Yeah, I’m tired, all 
right. We’re starting a whole 
new line of research. Whole 
flock of bright young men in 
from Washington today. Brief 
cases and slide rules.” 

“Not—” 

“Oh, I’m still in charge.” 
Professor Douglas grinned 
expansively. “Perish the 
thought.” Pale gray cigarette 
smoke billowed around him. 
“It’ll be another few years be- 
fore they’re ahead of me. 
They’ll have to sharpen up 
their slide rules just a little 
bit more . .” 

His wife smiled and contin- 
ued preparing dinner. Maybe 
it was the atmosphere of the 
little Colorado town. The 
sturdy, impassive mountain 
peaks around them. The thin, 
chill air. The quiet citizens. In 
any case, her husband seemed 
utterly unbothered by the ten- 
sions and doubts that pres- 
sured other members of his 
profession. A lot of aggressive 
newcomers were swelling the 
ranks of nuclear physics these 
days. Old-timers were totter- 
ing in their positions, abrupt- 
ly insecure. Every college, 
every physics department and 
lab was being invaded by the 
new horde of skilled young 
men. Even here at Bryant 
College, so far off the beaten 
track. 

But if Anthony Douglas 
worried, he never let it show. 
He rested happily in his easy 
chair, eyes shut, a blissful 

34 



smile on his face. He was tired 
— but at peace. He sighed 
again, this time more from 
pleasure than fatigue. 

“It’s true,” he murmured 
lazily. “I may be old enough to 
be their father, but I’m still a 
few jumps ahead of them. Of 
course, I know the ropes bet- 
ter. And—” 

“And the wires. The ones 
worth pulling.” 

“Those, too. In any case, 1 
think I’ll come off from this 
new line we’re doing just 
about ...” 

His voice trailed off. 

“What’s the matter?” Laura 
asked. 

Douglas half rose from his 
chair. His face had gone sud- 
denly white. He stared in hor- 
ror, gripping the arms of his 
chair, his mouth opening and 
closing. 

At the window was a great 
eye. An immense eye that 
gazed into the room intently, 
studying him. The eye filled 
the whole window. 

“Good God!” Douglas cried. 

The eye withdrew. Outside 
there was only the evening 
gloom, the dark hills and 
trees, the street. Douglas sank 
down slowly in his chair. 

“What was it?” Laura de- 
manded sharply. “What did 
you see? Was somebody out 
there?” 

D OUGLAS clasped and un- 
clasped his hands. His 
lips twitched violently. “I’m 
telling you the truth, Bill. I 



PHILIP K. DICK 




saw it myself. It was real. I 
wouldn’t say so, otherwise. 
You know that. Don’t you be- 
lieve me?” 

“Did anybody else see it?” 
Professor William Henderson 
asked, chewing his pencil 
thoughtfully. He had cleared 
a place on the dinner table, 
pushed back his plate and sil- 
ver and laid out his notebook. 
“Did Laura see it?” 

“No. Laura had her back 
turned.” 

“What time was it?” 

“Half an hour ago. I had 
just got home. About six- 
thirty. I had my shoes off, tak- 
ing it easy.” Douglas wiped 
his forehead with a shaking 
hand. 

“You say it was unattach- 
ed? There was nothing else? 
Just the — eye?” 

“Just the eye. One huge eye 
looking in at me. Taking in 
everything. As if — ” 

“As if what?” 

“As if it was looking down 
a microscope.” 

Silence. 

From across the table, Hen- 
derson’s red-haired wife spoke 
up. “You always were a strict 
empiricist, Doug. You never 
went in for any nonsense be- 
fore. But this . It’s too bad 
nobody else saw it.” 

“Of course nobody else saw 
it!” 

“What do you mean?” 

“The damn thing was look- 
ing at me. It was me it was 
studying.” Douglas’ voice rose 
hysterically. “How do you 

FAIR GAME 



think I feel — scrutinized by an 
eye as big as a piano ! My God, 
if I weren’t so well integrated, 
I’d be out of my mind !” 

Henderson and his wife ex- 
changed glances. Bill, dark- 
haired and handsome, ten 
years Douglas’ junior. Viva- 
cious Jean Henderson, lectur- 
er in child psychology, lithe 
and full-bosomed in her nylon 
blouse and slacks. 

“What do you make of 
this?” Bill asked her. “This is 
more along your line.” 

“It’s in your line,” Douglas 
snapped. “Don’t try to pass 
this off as a morbid projection. 
I came to you because you’re 
head of the Biology Depart- 
ment.” 

“You think it’s an animal? 
A giant sloth or something?” 
“It must be an animal.” 
“Maybe it’s a joke,” Jean 
suggested. “Or an advertising 
sign. An oculist’s display. 
Somebody may have been 
carrying it past the window.” 
Douglas took a firm grip on 
himself. “The eye was alive. 
It looked at me. It considered 
me. Then it withdrew. As if 
it had moved away from the 
lens.” He shuddered. “I tell 
you it was studying me!” 
“You only?” 

“Me. Nobody else.” 

“You seem curiously con- 
vinced it was looking down 
from above,” Jean said. 

“Yes, down. Down at me. 
That’s right.” An odd expres- 
sion flickered across Douglas’ 
face. “You have it, Jean. As if 

35 




it came from up there.” He 
jerked his hand upward. 

“Maybe it was God,” Bill 
said thoughtfully. 

Douglas said nothing. His 
face turned ash white and his 
teeth chattered. 

“lYTONSENSE,” Jean said. 

-L ^ “God is a psychological 
transcendent symbol express- 
ing unconscious forces.” 

“Did it look at you accus- 
ingly?” asked Bill. “As if 
you’d done something wrong?” 
“No. With interest. With 
considerable interest.” Doug- 
las raised himself. “I have to 
get back. Laura thinks I’m 
having some kind of fit. I 
haven’t told her, of course. 
She’s not scientifically disci- 
plined. She wouldn’t be able to 
handle such a concept.” 

“It’s a little tough even for 
us,” Bill said. 

Douglas moved nervously 
toward the door. “You can’t 
think of any explanation? 
Something thought extinct 
that might still be roaming 
around these mountains?” 
“None that we know of. If 
I should hear of any — ” 

“You said it looked down,” 
Jean said. “Not bending down 
to peer in at you. Then it 
couldn’t have been an animal 
or terrestrial being.” She was 
deep in thought. “Maybe we’re 
being observed.” 

“Not you,” Douglas said 
miserably. “Just me.” 

“By another race,” Bill put 
in. “You think — ” 

36 



“Maybe it’s an eye from 
Mars.” 

Douglas opened the front 
door carefully and peered out. 
The night was black. A faint 
wind moved through the trees 
and along the highway. His 
car was dimly visible, a black 
square against the hills. “If 
you think of anything, call 
me.” 

“Take a couple of pheno- 
barbitals before you hit the 
sack,” Jean suggested. “Calm 
your nerves.” 

Douglas was out on the 
porch. “Good idea. Thanks.” 
He shook his head. “Maybe 
I’m out of my mind. Good 
Lord. Well, I'll see you later.” 

He walked down the steps, 
gripping the rail tightly. 
“Good night!” Bill called. The 
door closed and the porch light 
clicked off. 

Douglas went cautiously to- 
ward his car. He reached out 
into the darkness, feeling for 
the door handle. One step. 
Two steps. It was silly. A 
grown man — practically mid- 
dle-aged — in the twentieth 
century. Three steps. 

He found the door and 
opened it, sliding quickly in- 
side and locking it after him. 
He breathed a silent prayer of 
thanks as he snapped on the 
motor and the headlights. 
Silly as hell. A giant eye. A 
stunt of some sort. 

He turned the thought over 
in his mind. Students? Joke- 
sters? Communists? A plot to 
drive him out of his mind? 



PHILIP K. DICK 




He was important. Probably 
the most important nuclear 
physicist in the country. And 
this new project . 

He drove the car slowly for- 
ward, onto the silent highway. 
He watched each bush and 
tree as the car gained speed. 

A Communist plot. Some of 
the students were in a left- 
wing club. Some sort of Marx- 
ist study group. Maybe they 
had rigged up — 

In the glare of the head- 
lights something glittered. 
Something at the edge of the 
highway. 

Douglas gazed at it, trans- 
fixed. Something square, a 
long block in the weeds at the 
side of the highway, where 
the great dark trees began. It 
glittered and shimmered. He 
slowed down, almost to a stop. 

A bar of gold, lying at the 
edge of the road. 

I T WAS incredible. Slowly, 
Professor Douglas rolled 
down the window and peered 
out. Was it really gold? He 
laughed nervously. Probably 
not. He had often seen gold, 
of course. This looked like 
gold. But maybe it was lead, 
an ingot of lead with a gilt 
coating. 

But — why? 

A joke. A prank. College 
kids. They must have seen his 
car go past toward the Hen- 
dersons’ and knew he’d soon be 
driving back. 

Or — or it really was gold. 
Maybe an armored car had 



gone past. Turned the corner 
too swiftly. The ingot had slid 
out and fallen into the weeds. 
In that case there was a little 
fortune lying there, in the 
darkness at the edge of the 
highway. 

But it was illegal to possess 
gold. He’d have to return it to 
the Government. But couldn’t 
he saw off just a little piece? 
And if he did return it there 
was no doubt a reward of 
some kind. Probably several 
thousand dollars. 

A mad scheme flashed brief- 
ly through his mind. Get the 
ingot, crate it up, fly it to Mex- 
ico, out of the country. Eric 
Barnes owned a Piper Cub. 
He could easily get it into 
Mexico. Sell it. Retire. Live in 
comfort the rest of his life. 

Professor Douglas snorted 
angrily. It was his duty to re- 
turn it. Call the Denver Mint, 
tell them about it. Or the po- 
lice department. He reversed 
his car and backed up until he 
was even with the metal bar. 
He turned off the motor and 
slid out onto the dark high- 
way. He had a job to do. As 
a loyal citizen — and, God 
knew, fifty tests had shown he 
was loyal — there was a job for 
him here. He leaned into the 
car and fumbled in the dash- 
board for the flashlight. If 
somebody had lost a bar of 
gold, it was up to him . 

A bar of gold. Impossible. 
A slow, cold chill settled over 
him, numbing his heart. A 
tiny voice in the back of his 



FAIR GAME 



37 




mind spoke clearly and ration- 
ally to him: Who would walk 
off and leave an ingot of gold? 
Something was going on. 

F EAR gripped him. He stood 
frozen, trembling with ter- 
ror. The dark, deserted high- 
way. The silent mountains. He 
was alone. A perfect spot. If 
they wanted to get him — 
They? 

Who? 

He looked quickly around. 
Hiding in the trees, most like- 
ly. Waiting for him. Waiting 
for him to cross the highway, 
leave the road and enter the 
woods. Bend down and try to 
pick up the ingot. One quick 
blow as he bent over; that 
would be it. 

Douglas scrambled back in- 
to his car and snapped on the 
motor. He raced the motor and 
released the brake. The car 
jerked forward and gained 
speed. His hands shaking, 
Douglas bore down desperate- 
ly on the wheel. He had to get 
out. Get away before — who- 
ever they were got him. 

As he shifted into high he 
took one last look back, peer- 
ing around through the open 
window. The ingot was still 
there, still glowing among the 
dark weeds at the edge of the 
highway. But there was a 
strange vagueness about it, an 
uncertain waver in the nearby 
atmosphere. 

Abruptly the ingot faded 
and disappeared. Its glow 
receded into darkness. 



Douglas glanced up, and 
gasped in horror. 

In the sky above him, some- 
thing blotted out the stars. A 
great shape, so huge it stag- 
gered him. The shape moved, 
a disembodied circle of living 
presence, directly over his 
head. 

A face. A gigantic, cosmic 
face peering down. Like some 
great moon, blotting out every- 
thing else. The face hung for 
an instant, intent on him — on 
the spot he had just vacated. 
Then the face, like the ingot, 
faded and sank into darkness. 

The stars returned. He was 
alone. 

Douglas sank back against 
the seat. The car veered crazi- 
ly and roared down the high- 
way. His hands slid from the 
wheel and dropped at his 
sides. He caught the wheel 
again, just in time. 

There was no doubt about it. 
Somebody was after him. Try- 
ing to get him. But no Com- 
munists or student practical 
jokers. Or any beast, lingering 
from the dim past. 

Whatever it was, whoever 
they were, had nothing to do 
with Earth. It — they — were 
from some other world. They 
were out to get him. 

Him . 

But — why? 

P ETE BERG listened close- 
ly. “Go on,” he said when 
Douglas halted. 

“That's all.” Douglas turned 
to Bill Henderson. “Don't try 



38 



PHILIP K. DICK 




to tell me I’m out of my mind. 
I really saw it. It was looking 
down at me. The whole face 
this time, not just the eye.” 
“You think this was the 
face that the eye belonged 
to?” Jean Henderson asked. 

“I know it. The face had the 
same expression as the eye. 
Studying me.” 

“We’ve got to call the po- 
lice,” Laura Douglas said in a 
thin, clipped voice. “This can’t 
go on. If somebody’s out to get 
him — ” 

“The police won’t do any 
good.” Bill Henderson paced 
back and forth. It was late, 
after midnight. All the lights 
in the Douglas house were on. 
In one corner old Milton 
Erick, head of the Math De- 
partment, sat curled up, 
taking everything in, his 
wrinkled face expressionless. 

“We can assume,” Profes- 
sor Erick said calmly, remov- 
ing his pipe from between his 
yellow teeth, “they’re a non- 
terrestrial race. Their size 
and their position indicate 
they’re not Earthbound in any 
sense.” 

“But they can’t just stand 
in the sky!” Jean exploded. 
“There’s nothing up there !” 
“There may be other config- 
urations of matter not nor- 
mally connected or related to 
our own. An endless or multi- 
ple coexistence of universe 
systems, lying along a plane 
of coordinates totally unex- 
plainable in present terms. 
Due to some singular juxtapo- 



sition of tangents, we are, at 
this moment, in contact with 
one of these other configura- 
tions.” 

“He means,” Bill Henderson 
explained, “that these people 
after Doug don’t belong to our 
universe. They come from a 
different dimension entirely.” 
“The face wavered,” Doug- 
las murmured. “The gold and 
the face both wavered and 
faded out.” 

“Withdrew,” Erick stated. 
“Returned to their own uni- 
verse. They have entry into 
ours at will, it would seem, a 
hole, so to speak, that they 
can enter through and return 
again.” 

“It’s a pity,” Jean said, 
“they’re so damn big. If they 
were smaller — ” 

“Size is in their favor,” 
Erick admitted. “An unfortu- 
nate circumstance.” 

“All this academic wran- 
gling!” Laura cried wildly. 
“We sit here working out 
theories and meanwhile they 
are after him!” 

“This might explain gods,” 
Bill said suddenly. 

“Gods?” 

B ILL nodded. “Don’t you 
see? In the past these 
beings looked across the nexus 
at us, into our universe. May- 
be even stepped down. Primi- 
tive people saw them and 
weren’t able to explain them. 
They built religions around 
them. Worshiped them.” 
“Mount Olympus,” Jean 

39 



FAIR GAME 




said. “Of course. And Moses 
met God at the top of Mount 
Sinai. We’re high up in the 
Rockies. Maybe contact only 
comes at high places. In the 
mountains, like this.” 

“And the Tibetan monks 
are situated in the highest 
land mass in the world,” Bill 
added. “That whole area. The 
highest and the oldest part of 
the world. All the great reli- 
gions have been revealed in 
the mountains. Brought down 
by people who saw God and 
carried the word back.” 

“What I can’t understand,” 
Laura said, “is why they want 
him.” She spread her hands 
helplessly. “Why not some- 
body else? Why do they have 
to single him out?” 

Bill’s face was hard. “I 
think that’s pretty clear.” 
“Explain,” Erick rumbled. 
“What is Doug? About the 
best nuclear physicist in the 
world. Working on top-secret 
projects in nuclear fission. Ad- 
vanced research. The Govern- 
ment is underwriting every- 
thing Bryant College is doing 
— because Douglas is here.” 
“So?” 

“They want him because of 
his ability. Because he knows 
things. Because of their size- 
relationship to this universe, 
they can subject our lives to 
as careful a scrutiny as we 
maintain in the biology labs of 
— 'well, of a culture of Sarcina 
Pulmonum. But that doesn’t 
mean they’re culturally ad- 
vanced over us.” 



“Of course!” Pete Berg ex- 
claimed. “They want Doug for 
his knowledge. They want to 
pirate him off and make use 
of his mind for their own cul- 
ture.” 

“Parasites!” Jean gasped. 
“They must have always de- 
pended on us. Don’t you see? 
Men in the past who have dis- 
appeared, spirited off by these 
creatures.” She shivered. 
“They probably regard us as 
some sort of testing ground, 
where techniques and knowl- 
edge are painfully developed — 
for their benefit.” 

Douglas started to answer, 
but the words never escaped 
his mouth. He sat rigid in his 
chair, his head turned to one 
side. 

Outside in the darkness be- 
yond the house, someone was 
calling his name. 

H E GOT up and moved to- 
ward the door. They were 
all staring at him in amaze- 
ment. 

“What is it?” Bill demand- 
ed. “What’s the matter, 
Doug?” 

Laura caught his arm. 
“What’s wrong? Are you sick? 
Say something! Doug!" 

Professor Douglas jerked 
free and pulled open the front 
door. He stepped out onto the 
porch. There was a faint 
moon. A soft light hovered 
over everything. 

“Professor Douglas!” The 
voice again, sweet and fresh 
— a girl’s voice. 



40 



PHILIP K. DICK 




Outlined by the moonlight, 
at the foot of the porch steps, 
stood a girl. Blonde-haired, 
perhaps twenty years old. In a 
checkered skirt, pale Angora 
sweater, a silk kerchief 
around her neck. She was 
waving at him anxiously, her 
small face pleading. 

“Professor, do you have a 
minute? Something terrible 
has gone wrong with ...” Her 
voice trailed off as she moved 
nervously away from the 
house, into the darkness. 

“What’s the matter?” he 
shouted. 

He could hear her voice 
faintly. She was moving off. 

Douglas was torn with in- 
decision. He hesitated, then 
hurried impatiently down the 
stairs after her. The girl re- 
treated from him, wringing 
her hands together, her full 
lips twisting wildly with de- 
spair. Under her sweater, her 
breasts rose and fell in an 
agony of terror, each quiver 
sharply etched by the moon- 
light. 

“What is it?” Douglas cried. 
“What’s wrong?” He hurried 
angrily after her. “For God’s 
sake, stand still!” 

The girl was still moving 
away, drawing him farther 
and farther away from the 
house, toward the great green 
expanse of lawn, the begin- 
ning of the campus. Douglas 
was overcome with annoy- 
ance. Damn the girl ! Why 
couldn’t she wait for him? 

“Hold on a minute!” he 



said, hurrying after her. He 
started out onto the dark 
lawn, puffing with exertion. 
“Who are you? What the hell 
do you — ” 

There was a flash. A bolt of 
blinding light crashed past 
him and seared a smoking pit 
in the lawn a few feet away. 

D ouglas halted, dum- 

founded. A second bolt 
came, this one just ahead of 
him. The wave of heat threw 
him back. He stumbled and 
half fell. The girl had abrupt- 
ly stopped. She stood silent 
and unmoving, her face ex- 
pressionless. There was a pe- 
culiar waxy quality to her. 
She had become, all at once, 
utterly inanimate. 

But he had no time to think 
about that. Douglas turned 
and lumbered back toward the 
house. A third bolt came, 
striking just ahead of him. 
He veered to the right and 
threw himself into the shrubs 
growing near the wall. Rolling 
and gasping, he pressed 
against the concrete side of 
the house, squeezing next to it 
as hard as he could. 

There was a sudden shim- 
mer in the star-studded sky 
above him. A faint motion. 
Then nothing. He was alone. 
The bolts ceased. And — 

The girl was gone, also. 

A decoy. A clever imitation 
to lure him away from the 
house, so he’d move out into 
the open where they could 
take a shot at him. 



FAIR GAME

He got shakily to his feet 
and edged around the side of 
the house. Bill Henderson and 
Laura and Berg were on the 
porch, talking nervously and 
looking around for him. There 
was his car, parked in the 
driveway. Maybe, if he could 
reach it— 

He peered up at the sky. 
Only stars. No hint of them. 
If he could get in his car and 
drive off, down the highway, 
away from the mountains, to- 
ward Denver, where it was 
lower, maybe he’d be safe. 

He took a deep, shuddering 
breath. Only ten yards to the 
car. Thirty feet. If he could 
once get in it — 

He ran. Fast. Down the 
path and along the driveway. 
He grabbed open the car door 
and leaped inside. With one 
quick motion he threw the 
switch and released the brake. 

The car glided forward. The 
motor came on with a sputter. 
Douglas bore down desperate- 
ly on the gas. The car leaped 
forward. On the porch, Laura 
shrieked and started down the 
stairs. Her cry and Bill’s star- 
tled shout were lost in the roar 
of the engine. 

A moment later he was on 
the highway, racing away 
from town, down the long, 
curving road toward Denver. 

H E COULD call Laura from 
Denver. She could join 
him. They could take the train 
east. The hell with Bryant 
College. His life was at stake. 



He drove for hours without 
stopping, through the night. 
The sun came up and rose 
slowly in the sky. More cars 
were on the road now. He 
passed a couple of diesel 
trucks rumbling slowly and 
cumbersomely along. 

He was beginning to feel a 
little better. The mountains 
were behind. More distance 
between him and them . 

His spirits rose as the day 
warmed. There were hundreds 
of universities and labora- 
tories scattered around the 
country. He could easily con- 
tinue with his work someplace 
else. They’d never get him, 
once he was out of the moun- 
tains. 

He slowed his car down. The 
gas gauge was near empty. 

To the right of the road was 
a filling station and a small 
roadside cafe. The sight of the 
cafe reminded him he hadn’t 
eaten breakfast. His stomach 
was beginning to protest. 
There were a couple of cars 
pulled up in front of the cafe. 
A few people were sitting in- 
side at the counter. 

He turned off the highway 
and coasted into the gas sta- 
tion. 

“Fill her up!” he called 
to the attendant. He got out 
on the hot gravel, leaving the 
car in gear. His mouth wa- 
tered. A plateful of hotcakes, 
side order of ham, steaming 
black coffee . “Can I leave 
her here?” 

“The car?” The white-clad 
PHILIP K. DICK 



42 




attendant unscrewed the cap 
and began filling the tank. 
“What do you mean?” 

“Fill her up and park her 
for me. I’ll be out in a few 
minutes. I want to catch some 
breakfast.” 

“Breakfast?” 

Douglas was annoyed. What 
was the matter with the man ? 
He indicated the cafe. A truck 
driver had pushed the screen 
door open and was standing 
on the step, picking his teeth 
thoughtfully. Inside, the wait- 
ress hustled back and forth. 
He could already smell the cof- 
fee, the bacon frying on the 
griddle. A faint tinny sound 
of a juke box drifted out. A 
warm, friendly sound. “The 
cafe.” 

The attendant stopped 
pumping gas. He put down the 
hose slowly and turned toward 
Douglas, a strange expression 
on his face. “What cafe?” he 
said. 

T HE cafe wavered and ab- 
ruptly winked out. Doug- 
las fought down a scream of 
terror. Where the cafe had 
been there was only an open 
field. 

Greenish brown grass. A 
few rusty tin cans. Bottles. 
Debris. A leaning fence. Off in 
the distance, the outline of the 
mountains. 

Douglas tried to get hold of 
himself. “I’m a little tired,” 
he muttered. He climbed un- 
steadily back into the car. 
“How much?” 



“I just hardly began to fill 
the—” 

“Here.” Douglas pushed a 
bill at him. “Get out of the 
way.” He turned on the motor 
and raced out onto the high- 
way, leaving the astonished 
attendant staring after him. 

That had been close. Damn 
close. A trap. And he had al- 
most stepped inside. 

But the thing that really 
terrified him wasn’t the close- 
ness. He was out of the moun- 
tains and they had still been 
ahead of him. 

It hadn’t done any good. He 
wasn’t any safer than last 
night. They were everywhere.. 

The car sped along the high- 
way. He was getting near 
Denver — but so what? It 
wouldn’t make any difference. 
He could dig a hole in Death 
Valley and still not be safe. 
They were after him and they 
weren’t going to give up. That 
much was clear. 

He racked his mind desper- 
ately. He had to think of some- 
thing, some way to get loose. 

A parasitic culture. A race 
that preyed on humans, util- 
ized human knowledge and 
discoveries. Wasn’t that what 
Bill had said? They were after 
his know-how, his unique abil- 
ity and knowledge of nuclear 
physics. He had been singled 
out, separated from the pack 
because of his superior ability 
and training. They would keep 
after him until they got him. 
And then — what? 

Horror gripped him. The 

43 



FAIR GAME 




gold ingot. The decoy. The girl 
had looked perfectly real. The 
cafe full of people. Even the 
smells of food. Bacon frying. 
Steaming coffee. 

God, if only he were just an 
ordinary person, without skill, 
without special ability. If 
only — 

A sudden flapping sound. 
The car lurched. Douglas 
cursed wildly. A flat. Of all 
times . 

Of all times. 

D OUGLAS brought the car 
to a halt at the side of the 
road. He switched off the mo- 
tor and put on the brake. For 
a while he sat in silence. Fi- 
nally he fumbled in his coat 
and got out a mashed pack- 
age of cigarettes. He lit up 
slowly and then rolled the 
window down to let in some 
air. 

He was trapped, of course. 
There was nothing he could 
do. The flat had obviously been 
arranged. Something on the 
road, sprinkled down from 
above. Tacks, probably. 

The highway was deserted. 
No cars in sight. He was ut- 
terly alone, between towns. 
Denver was thirty miles 
ahead. No chance of getting 
there. Nothing around him 
but terribly level fields, deso- 
lated plains. 

Nothing but level ground — 
and the blue sky above. 

Douglas peered up. He 
couldn’t see them, but they 
were there, waiting for him to 

44 



get out of his car. His knowl- 
edge, his ability, would be 
utilized by an alien culture. He 
would become an instrument 
in their hands. All his learn- 
ing would be theirs. He would 
be a slave and nothing more. 

Yet, in a way, it was a com- 
pliment. From a whole society, 
he alone had been selected. 
His skill and knowledge, over 
everything else. A faint glow 
rose in his cheeks. Probably 
they had been studying him 
for some time. The great eye 
had no doubt often peered 
down through its telescope, or 
microscope, or whatever it 
was, peered down and seen 
him. Seen his ability and real- 
ized what that would be worth 
in its own culture. 

Douglas opened the car 
door. He stepped out onto the 
hot pavement. He dropped his 
cigarette and calmly stubbed 
it out. He took a deep breath, 
stretching and yawning. He 
could see the tacks now, bright 
bits of light on the surface of 
the pavement. Both front tires 
were flat. 

Something shimmered 
above him. Douglas waited 
quietly. Now that it had final- 
ly come, he was no longer 
afraid. He watched with a 
kind of detached curiosity. 
The something grew. It fan- 
ned out over him, swelling and 
expanding. For a moment it 
hesitated. Then it descended. 

Douglas stood still as the 
enormous cosmic net closed 
over him. The strands pressed 

PHILIP K. DICK 




against him as the net rose. 
He was going up, heading to- 
ward the sky. But he was re- 
laxed, at peace, no longer 
afraid. 

Why be afraid? He would 
be doing much the same work 
as always. He would miss 
Laura and the college, of 
course, the intellectual com- 
panionship of the faculty, the 
bright faces of the students. 
But no doubt he would find 
companionship up above. Per- 
sons to work with. Trained 
minds with which he could 
communicate. 

T HE net was lifting him 
faster and faster. The 
ground fell rapidly away. The 
Earth dwindled from a flat 
surface to a globe. Douglas 
watched with professional in- 
terest. Above him, beyond the 
intricate strands of the net, he 
could see the outline of the 
other universe, the new world 
toward which he was heading. 

Shapes. Two enormous 
shapes squatting down. Two 
incredibly huge figures bend- 



ing over. One was drawing in 
the net. The other watched, 
holding something in its hand. 
A landscape. Dim forms too 
vast for Douglas to compre- 
hend. 

At last , a thought came. 
What a struggle . 

It tvas worth it, thought the 
other creature. 

Their thoughts roared 
through him. Powerful 
thoughts, from immense 
minds. 

I teas right . The biggest 
yet . What a catch! 

Must tveigh all of twenty- 
four vagets! 

At least! 

Suddenly Douglas' compo- 
sure left him. A chill of hor- 
ror flashed through his mind. 
What were they talking 
about? What did they mean? 

But then he was being 
dumped from the net. He was 
falling. Something was com- 
ing up at him. A flat, shiny 
surface. What was it? 

Oddly, it looked almost like 
a frying pan.

Promoters of institutional research are ill-informed according to W. J. 
Kroll, originator of the famous Kroll process used for producing metallic 
titanium and zirconium. Kroll points out that in the last few years two- 
fifths of all U. S. patents have been taken out by individual inventors, 
and that only a very few institutional scientists ever received the Nobel 
Prize . The problem seems to break down into basic and applied re- 
search. The former needs little organization and not much equipment — 
only an idea. But applied research does lend itself to organization . 
Setting up institutions and teams just happens to be the easiest way of 
accomplishing this.

the 



scarlet 
hexapod 

By MARGARET ST. CLAIR 

Of course the y were batty

were right all the time? 



“TIE CERTAINLY is a cute “He’s a Darkside hexapod,” 
H animal,” Mrs. Norris Bixi Clovis replied. “Maybe

But what is he, anyway? I member seeing a voca-piece 
thought he was some sort of in the last issue of Vue about 
dog when he came squirming them. But I thought they were 
under the gate to say hello, but always violet or plum color.” 
I never saw a dog with six “Usually they are. But 
legs.” Sonsy’s last litter had two 



46 




that were that sort of sunset 
color, like Jeff, and one that 
was jet black all over except 
for her toenails and the irises 
of her eyes. They were a sort 
of kingfisher blue.” 

"It sounds lovely.” 

“Oh, she was. Everyone that 
saw her wanted her.” 

“You raise them to sell?” 
Mrs. Norris asked. Jeff had 
come loose from her ankle 
and was lying on the garden 
path in front of her, all six 
feet raised in adoration, while 
his bushy, flame-colored tail 
thumped rhythmically on the 
plastic stepping stones. 

“Well, yes and no,” Bixi an- 
swered. “In the first place, all 
that stuff about how they have 
litters as soon as they get some 
borax to eat is nonsense. They 
are crazy about borax, of 
course, but they have litters 
when they feel like it, and not 
before. The litter Jeff was 
born in is the first one Sonsy's 
had in six years. And in the 
second place, you can't sell a 
hexapod unless he wants to be 
sold. If he doesn't like the per- 
son you sell him to, he'll come 
right home again. Hexies have 
a better sense of direction 
than carrier pigeons, and they 
won't compromise — either it's 
love at first sight or it's no 
sale.” 

‘The voca-piece said they 
were highly intelligent." Mrs. 
Norris was rubbing Jeff be- 
tween his ears ; his eyes were 
nearly shut, and he was mak- 
ing a noise that was a cross 



between a gurgle and a coo. 

“Oh, they are. Really, they 
are uncanny. They won't learn 
tricks or anything like that — 
if you try to teach them, they 
just look at you and thump 
their tails. But they seem to 
understand everything you 
say, and Bill, my husband, 
says that Sonsy's always doing 
things he only thought about 
her doing. The other day he 
couldn't find a blank for the 
dictatype, and she picked one 
up in her mouth and brought 
it over to him.” 

J EFF had climbed into Mrs. 

Norris' arms somehow and 
was licking her ear apprecia- 
tively. He looked startling and 
improbable, against the back- 
ground of her white dress and 
silvery hair. 

“You know,” she said, “I 
feel like I've just got to have 
this little fellow. I've been 
wanting a pet for some time, 
but Evan — he's my nephew — 
says it would be too much 
trouble, traveling around the 
way we do. He likes to be al- 
ways on the go. But I just 
know Jeff won't be any trou- 
ble; he's so cute and sweet. 
How much is he, anyway?” 
Bixi told her, feeling a little 
apologetic. 

“Oh,” Mrs. Norris said. 
“Well, I guess I can afford it 
I won't tell Evan, though. He 
— well, I won't tell him.” 

The big zircoridiums on her 
hand glittered brilliantly as 
she put her thumbprint on the 



47 




voucher. The papers were 
made out, the transaction was 
complete. Jeff licked Bixi po- 
litely on the nose in farewell, 
and trotted sedately after his 
new boss. 

The next morning, while 
Bixi and her husband were at 
breakfast, there was a scratch- 
ing at the door. “It’s Jeff,” 
Bixi reported when she came 
back. “He looks as if he has 
something on what passes for 
his mind. Do you suppose 
something’s wrong?” 

Jeff trotted into the center 
of the room, fixed his eyes on 
the Clovises, and began to 
howl. 

“What’s the matter, old 
fellow?” Bill asked, holding 
out a piece of whost toward 
the hexapod. 

Jeff sniffed briefly at the 
whost, wagged his tail twice, 
and then began howling more 
loudly than ever. 

“I’m going to call the hotel,” 
Bixi said above the din. “This 
is very funny. I’d have said 
Mrs. Norris was crazy about 
him and he about her.” 

Bill nodded. 

“The clerk says the Nor- 
rises left for Bagdad by 
stratoliner this morning,” Bixi 
Clovis reported after a session 
on the video. 

“Bagdad?” 

“Mm-hmm. And when I 
asked him if they had a hexa- 
pod with them, he said, 'What 
is a hexapod?’ So — where’s 
Jeff?” 

“He went out of the room 



while you were talking. Prob- 
ably went back to the hotel to 
look for Mrs. Norris. Don’t 
worry about him ; he’s got 
more sense about traffic than 
most human beings.” 

“Oh, I’m not nervous about 
him. But what’s going on? I 
wonder — ” 

Bill left to go to work, and 
Bixi went on wondering. Late 
that afternoon the clerk at the 
stratoport called on the video. 

“Say, is this your hexa- 
pod?” he asked, holding up the 
struggling, scarlet form of 
Jeff for her to see. 

“. Why, yes.” 

“Well, you better come 
down and get him. It’s a good 
thing I remembered you peo- 
ple breed hexapods. He’s been 
trying to get on stratoliners 
all afternoon. Twice they 
stopped him at the gang- 
plank, and once he got into the 
cabin before he was caught.” 
“Were the liners for Bag- 
dad?” Bixi asked, feeling a 
thrill of superstitious awe 
that was almost fear. 

“Why, no, they were en 
route for South America, for 
Valparaiso. I don’t know how 
he happened to pick three 
headed for the same place.” 
“Valparaiso. O.K., I’ll come 
down and get him.” 

sure it isn’t dan- 
1 gerous, Evan?” Mrs. 
Norris asked. “I must confess 
the idea rather frightens me.” 
“Oh, not in the least, Aunt 
Emily,” her lanky nephew 

MARGARET ST. CLAIR

said. "I wouldn’t want you to 
try it if I thought it might be 
dangerous. But I know you’ll 
enjoy it. First the long ski 
run — ” 

“Do you think I can manage 
skis at my age, Evan?” Mrs. 
Norris asked a little doubt- 
fully. 

“Oh, they’re motor-driven. 
No trick to it at all. First the 
long ski run and then, just at 
the top, when you’re almost 
two kilometers up, the anti- 
grav comes on automatically, 
and you go floating slowly 
down. The harbor’s in front of 
you and the mountains be- 
hind ; I read the other day that 
that view of Valparaiso is one 
of the seven wonders of the 
modern world. You wouldn’t 
want to miss a thrill like that, 
would you, Auntie?” 

“No, I guess not,” Mrs. 
Norris agreed. Her face grew 
wistful. “You haven’t had any 
answer to your grams to Mrs. 
Clovis yet, have you?” 

“No, not a word.” 

“I can’t understand it. She 
seemed so conscientious and 
reliable. What do you suppose 
happened to the little fellow? 
Sometimes I think we ought 
to go back to Oakland and 
hunt for him.” 

“Oh, nonsense. It’s a racket, 
that’s all. She has him trained 
to come back from wherever 
she sells him, so she can sell 
him over and over again. You 
are lucky to get out of it with- 
out more trouble, Aunt Emily, 
dealing with people like that. 



. You’d better get your 
things on, dear, before it’s too 
late to make the ski jump 
today.” 

“IT IS beautiful, Evan,” Mrs. 
Norris said, looking at the 
prospect before her. She gave 
her nephew’s hand a quick 
squeeze. “I’m glad you made 
me come. Have I got my feet 
in the skis right?” 

Evan knelt in the snow and 
looked at the fastenings. “Ex- 
actly right,” he reported. “I’ll 
be just behind you, Auntie, 
and remember, don’t lean too 
far out at the turns.” He 
walked over to the anti-grav 
mechanism. 

“I won’t, dear. What’s that 
man yelling about?” 

“Senor! Senor!” The fat 
little man who had taken their 
admission fees at the barrier 
was running up the snowy 
slope toward them, puffing and 
stumbling over his feet. “Cui- 
dado! Muy peligroso! No 
toques la maquina! Cuidado!” 
“Probably wants more mon- 
ey,” Evan said, turning negli- 
gently to face him. Mrs. Nor- 
ris’ skis began to move. “I’ll 
take care of it.” 

“You were right, Evan,” 
Emily Norris said when she 
and her nephew were down by 
the copter again. “It is one of 
the wonders of the world. The 
Terrestrial Chamber of Com- 
merce isn’t exaggerating when 
it says there’re things on Ter- 
ra that none of the other plan- 
ets can match. It was a little

scary when I got to the top of 
the incline, because I thought, 
What if the anti-grav doesn’t 
go on? I’d have been smashed 
into a dozen pieces. But I went 
floating down like a feather. 
But where were you? I waited 
quite a while before I thought 
of looking for you here. Did 
you decide not to make the 
jump? You really missed 
something.” 

“Got into a row with that 
damned ticket taker,” Evan 
said a little thickly. His face 
was pale. “Jabber, jabber — 
couldn’t make out what he 
wanted. Upset me — no use 
making that jump then. It was 
spoiled.” He cleared his 
throat. “Aunt Emily, how 
would you like to go to China 
next? I know how nervous you 
are about getting off of Terra, 
and we haven’t been to China 
for several years.” 

“To China?” Her face was 
doubtful. “Why, Evan, we on- 
ly just got here. Wouldn’t you 
like to stay a little while be- 
fore we start traveling again? 
It’s so beautiful here.” 

“Yes, I know, Auntie, but 
you know how easily I get 
bored. I’m afraid that’s just 
the way I am. Restless. Impa- 
tient.” He was chewing at his 
lower lip. 

“. Well, all right, dear. 
Anything you say.” 

B ILL CLOVIS stuck out his 
jaw. “I will not take a 
stratoliner to Asia!” he said 
defiantly. “What’s the matter 

50 



with you, Bixi? Are you and 
that blasted animal both 
crazy? I had to draw a big 
hunk out of our savings ac- 
count to get the tickets to Val- 
paraiso when Jeff acted up, 
and now one of you has de- 
cided, before we even get 
there, that we’ve got to go to 
Asia instead. Asia! And we’re 
only to Mexico City ! God only 
knows if I can get a refund 
on the tickets.” 

“Ssh!” Bixi said warningly. 
“People can hear you all over 
the waiting room.” Jeff put his 
front feet up on her knees 
and looked at her pleadingly; 
he had been shivering ever 
since they got into the Ciudad 
Mexico stratoport. His bushy 
tail was lusterless and limp. 
“Can’t you see Jeff knows 
something? He didn’t keep 
pulling us over to the Chi- 
nese stratoliners for nothing. 
He’s nearly worried to death. 
It’s serious. You know how 
hexies are.” 

“Yeah, I know how they 
are. Crazy. He’s had too much 
borax, that’s all. Don’t you re- 
alize I can’t possibly get back 
to work on Monday if we go 
to China? This is Saturday! 
And Darnell is out for my 
scalp anyhow. I’ve had enough 
of this idiotic wild-goose 
chase.” 

“But darling—” 

“Jeff’s imagining the whole 
thing! We’re going home!” 

“BUT I FEEL so weak,” Mrs. 
Norris said pleadingly. “I 



MARGARET ST. CLAIR 




ought to be over the food poi- 
soning by now, oughtn’t I, 
Evan dear? Surely it wouldn’t 
hurt me to have a little more 
to eat. I feel so hungry and 
faint all the time, and I never 
get anything except broth.” 
Evan Norris shook his head. 
“Now, Auntie, the doctor 
knows what’s good for you. 
You don’t realize that you’ve 
been very ill. If you overload 
your stomach, you might have 
a relapse.” 

Mrs. Norris sighed. “I don’t 
like the nurse, either,” she 
said. 

“Why not? Isn’t she com- 
petent?” 

“Oh, I guess so, but — she 
isn’t respectful, and she’s so 
rough when she gives me my 
bath. And yesterday I heard 
her muttering something un- 
der her breath when I asked 
her for my somni-spray.” 
“Aunt Emily, you mustn’t 
go imagining things.” 

“I do try, but . Evan, 
couldn’t I have an English doc- 
tor? I’m sure Dr. Chung does 
not understand me when I tell 
him about my symptoms, and 
I know I don’t understand 
anything he says. I always feel 
worse after I take my medi- 
cine; it isn’t doing me any 
good.” 

“Now, Auntie,” Evan said 
with a touch of severity, “you 
mustn’t talk like that about 
Dr. Chung. He’s the best phy- 
sician in Canton.” 

“Oh, dear,” Mrs. Norris 
said. Tears came into her 



eyes ; she cried so easily nowa- 
days. “I wish I had that little 
hexapod I bought. What was 
his name? Jeff. I wish I had 
Jeff.” 

“Don’t think about it, 
Auntie,” Evan advised. “It 
isn’t good for you. After lunch 
there are a few papers I want 
you to sign and thumb for 
me.” 

“I thought I did everything 
like that in Valparaiso. Oh, 
Evan, I just don’t feel equal 
to business now.” 

“All you have to do is print 
your thumb a couple of times. 
That’s all I want you to do.” 
“Oh, dear,” Mrs. Norris 
said again. Weakly she turned 
her head toward the wall. It 
annoyed Evan to see her cry. 
“Oh, dear.” 

“T KNEW you’d come, Bill!” 
A Bixi said. Her face was 
radiant. “I’m so glad you’re 
here!” She gave her husband 
a vigorous hug. 

“After I got your gram, 
what else could I do? Couldn’t 
have you getting into a lot of 
trouble by yourself,” he an- 
swered with a hint of grim- 
ness. “Everything’s fixed; I 
got leave from the office, and 
the hexies at home are fine. 
Listen, are they still here?” 
“The Norrises? Sure. They 
are three doors down, on the 
same balcony that this room 
is.” Bixi’s face grew sober. 
“She’s sick in bed, Bill,” she 
said with a rush. “I pretended 
to be an agent of China Tour- 



THE SCARLET HEXAPOD

ist interviewing visitors. Her 
nephew talked to me at the 
door. I looked over his shoul- 
der and saw her. She’s so thin, 
and her face is a funny color, 
almost green. They have a 
Chinese doctor and a dizzy 
blonde nurse with the tallest 
stilt heels I ever saw, and her 
uniform fits her so tight it’s a 
wonder she can breathe with- 
out an oxygen mask. I’m sure 
Mrs. Norris isn’t sick. You’d 
know what I mean if you saw 
her nephew and that nurse.” 
Bill rubbed his jaw thought- 
fully. “How’s Jeff taking it?” 
“He spends most of the time 
on the balcony outside their 
room, listening. I was afraid 
he’d try to jump in through 
the window (this hotel is a 
dump — windows with glass in 
them), but he stays out of 
sight and listens. But what 
are we going to do? Even if 
something is wrong, Evan is 
her nephew, and we’re not 
even friends of hers. If we try 
to start anything, he’ll just 
take her somewhere else and — 
what are we going to do?” 
There was a long, thought- 
ful pause. “I guess we’ll have 
to leave it to Jeff,” Bill Clovis 
said at last. 

"THANK YOU, Aunt Emily,” 
Evan Norris said. He folded 
the documents his aunt had 
just thumbed and signed, and 
put them neatly away in a 
dispatch case. “It’s almost six- 
teen,” he said, looking at his 
informeter. “Mab — the nurse 



— is still off duty. What do you 
say we have tea together, 
Auntie dear?” 

“You’re sure it won’t upset 
me?” Mrs. Norris said feebly 
from the bed. “Yesterday the 
tea made me feel a little sick.” 
“It was only your imagina- 
tion. A nice cup of tea will do 
you good.” He rang the serv- 
ice bell. 

“Couldn’t I have one of 
those little crumpets?” Mrs. 
Norris asked when the tea had 
been brought. “They smell so 
good.” 

“Better not, Auntie,” Evan 
advised, beginning to pour out 
the tea. “It might make — good 
God, what’s that noise?” 

An appalling racket had 
begun at the window, a 
scratching, grinding, clashing, 
rattling noise, like a fight be- 
tween a Martian vrys and a 
dhobi in an electrical storm. 

Evan went over to the win- 
dow and looked out. “Nothing 
there or on the balcony, as far 
as I could see,” he reported 
when he came back to the tea 
table. “Can’t imagine what 
caused it. I’ll complain to the 
management if it happens 
again.” 

“It is refreshing,” Mrs. 
Norris declared after a pause, 
during which she had been 
sipping from her cup. “Not at 
all like what I had yesterday. 
Don’t you think it’s better, 
Evan? Why, Evan, what’s the 
matter? Evan! Are you ill?” 
Evan did not answer. He 
had slumped back against the 



52 



MARGARET ST. CLAIR 




side of his chair. His face was 
a dull red and his breathing 
rasping and slow. As Mrs. 
Norris watched, the thin por- 
celain teacup slipped from his 
fingers and fell to the floor. 

Jeff jumped through the 
open window. He paused to 
lick Mrs. Norris quickly on 
her astonished nose, and then 
took his stand in front of her 
unconscious nephew. He be- 
gan to bark. Jeff had a deep 
chest, even for a hexapod. He 
was a really notable barker 
when he chose. They heard 
him all over the hotel. 

“TTE SAVED my life,” Mrs. 

Al Norris said. Jeff, who 
was lying curled elaborately 
around her ankles, thumped 
the eutex languidly with his 
tail. He had the air of a hexa- 
pod whose troubles are over. 

“If I'd drunk the tea Evan 
had fixed for me, "as weak as 
I was ... It was supposed to 
finish me off, you see, make 
it look like a natural death . 
But this little fellow made all 
that racket at the window just 
at the right time, and Evan 
got mixed up and drank it 
himself. I couldn't understand 
what had happened at first; 
I thought he'd had some sort 
of fit. I never was so glad to 
see anybody in my life, Mrs. 
Clovis, as I was when you 
came to the window, after Jeff 
began to bark, and asked me if 
your hexapod was annoying 
me. It was like waking up 
from a dreadful dream. Are 

THE SCARLET HEXAPOD 



you sure five thousand will be 
enough to build the new hexa- 
pod kennel, Mrs. Clovis? I'd be 
glad to give you more; I feel 
that I owe you people a great, 
great deal.” 

“Skip it,” Bixi said hastily. 
“Jeff deserves all the credit. 
Where is Evan now?” 

“The court sentenced him to 
be rehabilitated.” Mrs. Norris 
sighed. “I hope the treatment 
does him good. It's hard for 
me to believe ; his mother was 
my husband's favorite sister. 
But now that I look back on it, 
I realize that at Valparaiso, 
too, he was trying . He 
meant to damage the anti- 
grav mechanism on the ski- 
jump there, so I'd fall. He said 
at the trial that the nurse (she 
wasn't a nurse at all, really) 
suggested it, but that Dr. 
Chung didn't know what was 
going on. Evan never gave me 
any of the medicine the doctor 
left — what I had was drugs he 
and that nurse got — and they 
lied to the doctor about my 
treatment . Anyhow, I still 
have Jeff. When I get a little 
stronger, I'm going shopping 
for the finest collar for him 
I can find. He's a wonderful, 
wonderful animal, Mrs. 
Clovis.” 

“Yes,” Bill Clovis answered, 
smiling at Bixi, “it all goes to 
show the truth of the old say- 
ing Bixi is always quoting at 
me : ‘If a hexapod bites a man, 
put the man in jail.' Hexapods 
are alwavs right.”

How could it give away such buys? Very easy — by don 
a business in pennies and a profit in billions ! 




By CHARLES L. FONTENAY 

J ACK HANSHAW was mad- 
der than a wet hen and 
his roommate, Ken Adaman, 
was enjoying his misfortune 
hugely. 

“Not a blame thing!” snarl- 
ed Jack, fiddling with the 
knobs of the television set. 
“Not even static lines. First 
they give me a set without a 



54 





plug-in cord, and now this 
one’s got a no-good picture 
tube.” 

“You get what you pay for,” 
said Ken, laughing. “I’ve 
warned you about these so- 
called bargains. But what’s 
this about the plug-in cord?” 

Ken had been at work the 
day before, when Jack first 
brought the new television set 
into their apartment and dis- 
covered that omission. 

“I didn’t see any point in 
saying anything about that 
last night,” admitted Jack. 
“After I bought the thing yes- 
terday and brought it home, I 
found out it didn’t have a cord 
to plug it in — not even a con- 
nection in the back for a cord. 
I took it back to them and they 
said something about the 
wrong kind of power and fixed 
it up for me last night.” 

“You got stung, old buddy,” 
said Ken, unwinding his long 
legs from the arm of the easy 
chair. “They probably made it 
from junk parts.” 

“It doesn’t look like it,” said 
Jack stubbornly. 

It didn’t. The television set 
was shiny and new-looking, al- 
though rather odd. With a 
thirty-five-inch screen, it was 
only about six inches thick, 
and it had a strange antenna 
of concentric circles on top 
instead of the conventional 
rabbit ears. There were only 
two dials, one for the channels 
(it was lettered instead of 
numbered) and one for off -on 
and volume. 



“I’d take it back and de- 
mand my money,” said Ken. 

“I’ll take it back, all right, 
but if they’ll fix it, I don’t 
want my money back. Guess 
how much it cost me.” 

“Well . .” Ken pulled a 
stubby pipe from his coat 
pocket and began to pack it 
slowly from a humidor on the 
chairside table. “Knowing 
your bargains, I’d say about a 
hundred and fifty dollars.” 
“Two dollars,” said Jack. 
“Two dollars and no strings 
attached.” 

EN WHISTLED. “I smell 
a sucker game some- 
where.” 

“Maybe so, but what’s two 
dollars? The materials are 
worth more than that as junk. 
And if they fix it . How. 
about going along with me to 
return it, Ken?” 

Ken lit his pipe carefully 
and glanced at his wristwatch. 

“Okay,” he said, “if we can 
be back in an hour. I’m curi- 
ous to see this place, but I’ve 
got a date with Lorene tonight 
and I have to get cleaned up.” 
Jack winced. The room- 
mates were competitors for 
the hand of Lorene Shavely, 
the pert brunette in the to- 
bacco store down the street. 
But Ken was getting so much 
the better of it that it could 
be called competition in name 
only by now. 

“It’s only about five blocks, 
on Gehannon Street,” Jack 
said. “We’ll be back in time.”

He repacked the television 
set in its box. 

“Ardex,” said Ken, reading 
the name on the box. “Off- 
brand. I never heard of it be- 
fore.” 

They set out, Jack carrying 
the box under one arm. The 
set was remarkably light for 
its size. 

The street lights were com- 
ing on along Gehannon Street, 
for it was five o’clock on a 
winter afternoon. Jack bought 
a late edition from a newsboy 
on the corner. 

“Probably closed by now,” 
said Ken. 

But it wasn’t. Just past 
Wing Fan’s Chinese laundry, 
Jack turned into an alley and 
went down a flight of concrete 
steps. There was a door there, 
leading into a basement under 
the Eat-A-Bite Restaurant. It 
was unlighted, and there were 
no signs there to indicate any- 
thing but that the Grove 
Brothers Circus, Greatest 
Show on Earth, was coming 
to town two years ago. 

But when they opened the 
battered wooden door, the 
light inside was like fairy- 
land. Soft, of many changing 
hues, it lit a spotless expanse 
of floor that stretched away 
farther than Ken had real- 
ized the basement extended. 
The floor was broken by mer- 
chandise-loaded counters and 
gleaming machines. Here and 
there a clerk moved, in rai- 
ment that changed color with 
the light. 



One of the clerks approach- 
ed them. He was black-eyed, 
black-haired and handsome, 
and wore a tunic and balloon 

■f 

“Ah, Mr. Hanshaw!” he ex- 
claimed, recognizing Jack. 
“Glad to see you back again. 
But I see you have the — uh — 
television with you. Still hav- 
ing trouble?” 

“Yeah,” said Jack. “The 
screen’s no good. No picture at 
all.” 

The clerk looked puzzled. 
“The tube couldn’t be bad. It 
must be in the transmission 
facilities.” 

“You mean the TV sta- 
tions ? I don’t see how — ” 

“Different methods of trans- 
mission,” said the clerk hast- 
ily. “Just a minute, Mr. Han- 
shaw, and I’ll see what our 
communications man can do 
about this.” 

He took the box from Jack 
and started off. 

“Wait,” said Jack. “Here’s 
your newspaper.” 

W ITH A SMILE of thanks, 
the man accepted the 
paper and disappeared into 
the depths of the basement 
store. 

“What’s with the newspaper 
business?” demanded Ken. 

“That’s part of the bar- 
gain,” said Jack. “When I 
bought the television set, I 
agreed to bring him a late 
newspaper every time I come 
in the store.” 

“Hmm. Queer setup. And 



56 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




what kind of funny clothes is 
he wearing?” 

“Store uniform, I guess.” 

“Some uniform,” remarked 
Ken, who worked in a men’s 
clothing store. “That fabric’s 
spun glass, I think. And some 
of these people in ‘store uni- 
forms’ seem to be customers.” 

Indeed, some of the perhaps 
two dozen people visible, all 
dressed like the clerk, appear- 
ed to be making purchases. 

While waiting for the clerk 
to return, the two of them 
looked around at the nearby 
counters. 

“Funny thing about this 
place,” said Ken, “is I don’t 
know what seventy per cent of 
these gadgets they’re selling 
are. Those I can recognize look 
strange. Like that set of dishes 
— I’m no housewife, but I’ve 
never seen shapes like those 
before.” 

“I noticed that, too,” said 
Jack. “But anything they’ve 
got that we can use, we can’t 
afford not to buy, at the prices 
they ask.” 

“Let’s wait and see how the 
television set turns out,” sug- 
gested Ken. 

T HE clerk returned, empty- 
handed. 

“My communications man 
thinks he can fix your comm — 
television set so it will be all 
right, if you can bring us a 
technical manual on television 
sets. I hate to ask you to go to 
such trouble — ” 

“What! You mean you’ve 

BARGAIN BASEMENT 



got a television repairman 
who doesn’t have a manual on 
the things?” 

“Not on the type you need,” 
said the clerk apologetically. 
“It wouldn’t matter what 
brand or trade name the man- 
ual applies to.” 

“Why can’t you have your 
communications man go out 
and buy his own?” demanded 
Ken. “Or order one?” 

“Well — let’s just say it 
would cause great inconven- 
ience at this time. Mr. Han- 
shaw, I realize it would incon- 
venience you also, so in return 
for the favor I will be willing 
to give you, free, any item of 
merchandise in the store.” 
“Fair enough,” agreed Jack, 
his eyes gleaming. “I’ll bring 
it tomorrow.” 

“Incidentally, sir, would 
your friend be interested in a 
purchase while you are here?” 
“No, absolutely not,” said 
Ken, turning away. 

Jack caught his arm. “Oh, 
come on, Ken ! Price these 
things, anyhow. You’ll be 
astonished. Show Mr. Adaman 
something he can use.” 

“Mr. Adaman?” The clerk’s 
eyes widened delightedly. 
“Why, sir, that’s my name, 
too. Edigo Adaman.” 

“Mine’s Kenneth Adaman,” 
said Ken shortly, but he show- 
ed more interest. 

“It isn’t a common name,” 
said Edigo. “Are you by any 
chance a merchant, Mr. Ada- 
man?” 

“You might say so. I’m a 

57 




clerk in a men’s clothing 
store.” 

E DIGO nodded gravely. “My 
family has been in the 
mercantile business for many 
generations,” he said. “My 
father owns this store and it 
will be the largest in the 
Americas when we finish it. 
Now, Mr. Adaman, do you see 
anything that interests you? 
Anything at all?” 

“Well,” said Ken, moving 
over to a counter, “is this a 
watch?” 

“Yes, sir, and a very good 
one.” Edigo picked it up. It 
was a thin dial, with three 
hands and twenty-four nu- 
merals instead of the usual 
twelve. 

“It’s very nice-looking. But 
it’s a pocket watch, isn’t it? I 
wear a wristwatch.” 

“Oh, no,” said Edigo. “Hold 
out your arm.” 

Ken obeyed. Edigo placed 
the dial on his wrist, and it 
clung without apparent sup- 
port. 

“Say, that’s keen !” exclaim- 
ed Ken. “Some, sort of mag- 
netism, I suppose? How 
much?” 

“Would — would fifty cents 
be too much?” asked Edigo 
anxiously. 

“Fifty cents? Sold!” Ken 
pulled a coin from his pocket. 

“Oh, no, sir. Not the cash. 
Deposit it in the account, 
please, and bring me the de- 
posit slip. Mr. Hanshaw 
knows the bank.” 

58 



“That’s right,” said Jack. 
“Broadway National, account 
of Supercolossal Mercantile 
Company. Here’s the deposit 
slip on the two dollars for the 
television set.” 

“And we’ll have it straight- 
ened out for you right away, 
Mr. Hanshaw, if you can only 
bring us the manual.” 

As the two of them headed 
for the door to the basement, 
Ken said to Jack in a low 
tone : “There goes another 
customer out ahead of us. I’m 
going to stop him outside and 
see if he can give us the an- 
swers to some of the things I 
don’t understand about this 
place.” 

The customer, dressed like 
Edigo and all the others in the 
basement, went through the 
door just ahead of them. Jack 
caught it just before it shut. 
But when he and Ken mounted 
the steps, the man was no- 
where in sight, either up or 
down the alley. 

“Where could he have 
gone?” asked Ken in amaze- 
ment. “He’d have had to run 
like hell to get out of the alley 
before we got up here.” 

They walked to the mouth of 
the alley and emerged into the 
glare of the neon lights. Ken 
held up his new watch and 
looked at it in a stunned sort 
of way. 

“Say, you know something?” 
he said thoughtfully. “That 
fellow Edigo Adaman looks 
vaguely familiar to me.” 

“I noticed that, too,” said 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




Jack. “Look like any of your 
relatives?” 

Ken considered. “No, not in 
the least.” 

S EVERAL days later, Jack 
was in the tobacco store 
chatting with Lorene. Mr. 
Schmit, the store’s owner, 
registered silent disapproval 
in the background, but was 
not likely to protest openly 
unless Lorene slighted a cus- 
tomer. 

Jack had told Lorene about 
the strange bargain basement 
the day after he and Ken vis- 
ited it. He found that Ken had 
mentioned it to her that night, 
too. 

“I couldn’t find the kind of 
complete television manual 
they need at any of the book- 
stores,” said Jack gloomily. “I 
had to have one of them order 
me one, and while I’m wait- 
ing, no television. The man 
said it was color TV, too. I 
can’t understand any store 
that big not getting its own 
manuals.” 

“Have you ever been up- 
stairs?” asked Lorene. 

“Upstairs? There’s nothing 
there but the Eat-A-Bite Res- 
taurant.” 

“Oh. Ken said they had 
something like elevators going 
up, and it looked like they 
might have floors above.” 

“I didn’t know Ken had 
been back after that night,” 
said Jack in surprise. “He 
didn’t say anything to me 
about it. I got the impression 

BARGAIN BASEMENT 



he thought the whole thing 
was a fake.” 

Lorene’s black eyes sparkled 
as she smiled, and she turned 
a cheek to exhibit oddly cut 
earrings. 

“He brought me these ear- 
rings from there. I’d think 
you’d be buying other things, 
too, Jack, at those prices, in- 
stead of moping over that tele- 
vision set.” 

“Oh, I have,” said Jack. “I 
bought several suits of clothes 
at a dollar each. They didn’t 
have any in stock except those 
funny outfits they wear in the 
store, but I took them a pic- 
ture from a magazine adver- 
tisement and they made me 
some suits to order.” 

“Is that one of them?” ask- 
ed Lorene, gazing critically at 
the somewhat baggy suit he 
was wearing. 

“No,” said Jack sheepishly. 
“I thought they were too nice; 
to wear to work. They’re that; 
spun glass, or whatever it is. 
Go dancing with me tonight 
and I’ll wear one.” 

“Can’t,” said Lorene. ‘T’vei 
got a date with Ken.” 

“I never get to go out with! 
you any more, Lorene,” Jack 
said glumly. “What have I: 
done to make you turn me 
down every time?” 

“Nothing,” said Lorene can-; 
didly. “I like you as a friend, 
Jack. But Ken — well, he’s got! 
that extra something I can’t; 
resist. We’re going to get mar-, 
ried, you know.” 

“No, I didn’t,” said Jack,, 

59 ! 




but he wasn’t very surprised. 
Just then Ken breezed in. 
“Hi, honey,” he said. “Hello, 
Jack. Say, you two, come out 
and take a look at my new 
car.” 

“New car!” squealed Lo- 
rene. “Oh, Ken! But I can’t 
leave the store. I’ll have to 
look from the door.” 

“It’s down the block,” said 
Ken. “I’ll drive by, and you 
can get a good look tonight. 
Come on, Jack.” 

Jack went with him. The 
automobile was one of those 
low-slung, half-block-long af- 
fairs like one Jack vaguely re- 
membered seeing pictured in 
a foreign car magazine. 

“That’s not yours,” he said 
flatly. “Those things cost ten 
or fifteen thousand dollars.” 
“Cost me fifty,” said Ken 
smugly. “I got it at our friend 
Edigo’s store. Fifty bucks.” 
“You mean they carry 
things like that?” 

“I took them a picture and 
they made it for me,” said 
Ken. “Had to widen that door 
and put runways up the steps 
to drive it out of there. It cost 
me twice as much as the car 
to get the door widened and 
then bricked back the way it 
was. They worked on the in- 
side and I got a crew to work 
on the outside.” 

“Seems to me they’d have 
had it out in the street for 
you, instead of building it in 
the basement and then having 
to get it out,” said Jack criti- 
cally, gazing up and down the 

60 



gleaming length of black and 
chrome. 

“Ha!” said Ken slyly. 
“That’s just it, son. They 
couldn’t. I’ve found out the 
secret of our friends in the 
bargain basement.” 

“Secret? You mean there is 
something phony about it?” 
“I’ll tell you while we’re 
driving around in this dream 
wagon. But first let me show 
you something.” 

He went to the front of the 
car and raised the hood. Inside 
was the strangest little engine 
Jack had ever seen. 

“What is it?” he asked. 
“Turbo-jet,” said Ken 
proudly. “And if you’ll notice, 
you can’t see inside the car — 
one-way glass. And it’s got 
radar brakes and a hundred 
other new gadgets on it.” 

“But I thought the turbo- 
jet engine was still in the fu- 
ture,” protested Jack. 

“It is,” said Ken solemnly. 
“That’s where our bargain 
basement is — in the future.” 

T HE BIG CAR swept along 
the superhighway as si- 
lently as a floating cloud. The 
speedometer read 160. Ken ex- 
plained that was 160 kilo- 
meters, or about 100 miles an 
hour. He buzzed it up to 200 
kilometers once when some 
youngsters in a souped-up 
sports car sought to race with 
them. 

“They use solar power,” 
Ken explained, “but it’s broad- 
cast power and wouldn’t work 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




in a car sent back to the past. 
They made one like the pic- 
ture, which just showed the 
outside, and I suppose they 
assumed we use turbo- jets 
back in this period. It must be 
pretty ancient to them.” 

“Why would people from 
the future want to set up a 
store in the basement under 
the Eat-A-Bite Restaurant?” 
protested Jack. 

“Not from the future — in 
the future. For some reason, 
that basement door is in a 
time fault. People from now 
can go through it into the fu- 
ture and come back, and bring 
inanimate objects with them. 
But the people from the fu- 
ture can't come back to the 
past for some reason — that's 
why they can't go out and get 
things themselves, and that’s 
why they want us to bring 
them rare antiques, like news- 
papers and books.” 

“Maybe,” said Jack doubt- 
fully. “How did you guess all 
this?” 

“A little deduction. I had 
some conversations with Edi- 
go while I was shopping there. 
He said he just dug that base- 
ment as the lower floor of his 
new fifty-story building; but 
actually that basement's been 
there for years and is sup- 
posed to be empty. It belongs 
to old man Caswell, who owns 
the building the Eat-A-Bite’s 
in, and God knows how he's 
going to react if he ever walks 
into it and finds that store. 
And it's not just that. The 



costumes, the strange objects 
they have for sale, even that 
peculiar accent.” 

“ITOW far in the future?” 
■Tl asked Jack. 

“I don't know. Pretty far, I 
expect. How much interest 
does that bank account draw? 
You know, the one in their 
name, where we've been de- 
positing the money for the 
things we bought?” 

“Three per cent, I think, 
compounded quarterly.” 

“It would have to be com- 
pounded to amount to any- 
thing in a couple of hundred 
years or so.” 

“I still don't get it. Why do 
they sell things so cheap? Will 
prices be that much lower in 
the future?” 

“Probably a lot higher,” 
said Ken. “They don't even use 
the same sort of money we do 
— that's why they don't just 
ask us to make deposits of 
their own money for them. 
But they can afford to sell us 
at these ridiculously low 
prices because the deposits in 
their name draw compound 
interest and build up to a lot 
higher than the value of the 
merchandise in the future — 
their time. I expect every 
dime we deposit for them 
means a hundred dollars or 
more to them in their equiva- 
lent of our money.” 

“I just don't see that,” said 
Jack. “We're in their past. 
How could they have us de- 
posit money to build up for 



BARGAIN BASEMENT 



61 




them, unless, to them, the de- 
posits are already there?” 

“Edigo — you know, Jack, 
that fellow still reminds me of 
somebody I know — Edigo ex- 
plained it to me when I made 
him admit this future business 
was true. The future can be 
changed, and we could change 
the present if we could influ- 
ence the past. And don’t I 
wish I could manage that 
trick!” Ken added greedily. 
“So every time we put a dime 
in their account — pop ! — at 
their end, they’ve got an extra 
hundred dollars or more in 
the bank.” 

“I suppose so,” said Jack 
thoughtfully. “But how about 
this fellow Edigo digging the 
basement? The basement’s al- 
ready there now. The real one, 
I mean.” 

“In a hundred years, two 
hundred years, you think it’ll 
still be there?” demanded 
Ken scornfully. “Old Caswell’s 
basement’s going to fill in 
again, and some time in the 
future, this fellow Edigo Ada- 
man’s going to dig it out 
again. You know, Jack, with 
that name, he could be a de- 
scendant of mine.” 

“He seemed to think he 
might be, from what he said 
that first evening.” 

“Look, buddy, we’ll have to 
go back,” said Ken, pulling the 
car into a cloverleaf to turn 
around. “I’ve got a date with 
Lorene tonight, and I’m sure 
anxious to see her face when 
she climbs into this buggy.” 



“Sure,” said Jack. “But 
drop me off at the bargain 
basement, will you? I’ve got 
an idea for something I want 
to buy.” 

E DIGO LOOKED at Jack 
curiously. There was that 
odd familiarity to the man’s 
face that Jack couldn’t quite 
place. 

“We have strict regulations 
against influencing an individ- 
ual’s attitudes by artificial 
means,” he said. “But I don’t 
suppose it’s against the law 
in your time, is it?” 

“Not unless it’s a dangerous 
or habit-forming drug,” said 
Jack. “Possession of certain 
drugs, you know, can get you 
a stiff prison sentence. But 
there are milder things, like 
perfumes and alcohol, that in- 
fluence people temporarily. 
That’s sort of what I had in 
mind, only with a stronger ef- 
fect — not a habit-forming 
drug.” 

“Hmm,” murmured Edigo. 
“What we have wouldn’t have 
been discovered in your time 
and wouldn’t be covered by 
law. And it isn’t dangerous or 
habit-forming. It’s prescribed 
by psychologists in certain 
cases. But I am not sure I 
should—” 

“One hundred dollars,” said 
Jack. 

“It’s a great deal for five 
klens’ worth of . All right. 
Would you prefer it in liquid, 
tablet or powder form?” 
“How about like this?” sug- 



62 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




gested Jack, handing over a 
package of chewing gum. 

“Yes, it could be mixed in 
that. If you can wait a few 
minutes, I'll have our chemist 
prepare it.” 

Edigo went away with the 
chewing gum, and Jack gave 
himself over to doubts. Per- 
haps it wasn't fair, but what 
was that old saying about love 
and war? Jack convinced him- 
self that Ken hadn't been fair 
in getting that flashy car. 

What if Ken had thought of 
the same thing? 

A momentary chill passed 
over Jack. But no. Ken didn't 
need it. 

In a few moments, Edigo 
returned with the chewing 
gum. It looked no different. 
Jack couldn't tell whether it 
was the same gum, with a new 
ingredient added, or new 
sticks put in the old wrappers. 
It didn't matter. 

“Thank you. I'll deposit the 
hundred dollars right away,” 
said Jack. He took the gum 
and left. 

He went straight to the to- 
bacco store. He was just in 
time. Lorene was getting her 
hat and jacket on to return 
home. Surprisingly, Ken was 
not waiting outside for her 
with the new car. 

“I'll walk you home, Lo- 
rene,'' suggested Jack. 

“All right,'' she agreed, 
smiling at him. “Ken was to 
pick me up, but he phoned and 
said he had to work late on 
inventory.'' 



They left the store together. 
“Have some chewing gum,” 
suggested Jack, offering her a 
stick. It was much better than 
trying to slip liquid or a tablet 
in a milk shake. 

“Not right now,” she said. 
“It's too soon before supper.” 
“Oh, come on,” he invited 
jovially. “You only live once. 
I'll have some, too.” 

No harm in that. It couldn't 
change his feelings much, any- 
how. 

She accepted a stick, and 
they chewed as they walked. 
Jack could guess her feelings 
from the intensification of his 
own. Suddenly Lorene was the 
most beautiful woman in the 
world — Cleopatra, Helen, the 
Queen of Sheba. He would 
have died for her gladly. 

He took her hand in his and 
squeezed it. She leaned against 
his shoulder and turned starry 
eyes up to him. That walking 
kiss was the most ecstatic 
thing he had ever experienced. 

“Let's get married, Lorene,” 
he said huskily. “Now.” 

“Yes, Jack, yes,” she sighed. 

K EN TOOK the announce- 
ment rather hard. After 
all, he and Lorene already had 
set their wedding date. He 
looked very thoughtful, but 
Jack was not worried. Ken 
would never suspect that Lo- 
rene had been won away from 
him by a package of chewing 
gum doctored with some un- 
known drug from the future. 
Jack and Lorene would not 



BARGAIN BASEMENT 



63 




be able to get married until 
the next day, because the city 
hall had closed for the after- 
noon and they were unable to 
get a license. They spent the 
evening shopping in the bar- 
gain basement for Lorene’s 
trousseau, ordering things 
from pictures in magazine ad- 
vertisements, and planning for 
the future. 

“I’ll get them to make us a 
car like Ken’s,” said Jack, 
“and maybe we can work out 
some way of buying a house 
through them. With this set- 
up, we can live like royalty, 
even on my salary.” 

T HEIR wedding was a pecu- 
liar one — as the minister 
pronounced them man and 
wife, Jack’s clothing vanished. 
He was kissing his bride when 
a sudden chill and the gasps 
of those around him made him 
realize he was in his under- 
wear. 

He borrowed a suit from the 
minister and took Lorene back 
to the apartment. Ken was 
packing his things. 

“I’ll move my stuff to a 
hotel until I can find another 
apartment,” said Ken. “Call 
me a cab, will you, old man? 
Somebody’s stolen my car.” 
Jack and Lorene were to 
leave on their honeymoon the 
next day. That afternoon he 
announced his intention of go- 
ing to the bargain basement 
and lodging a complaint. 

“That suit and shirt I had 
on were clothes I bought 

64 



there,” he said. “If their 
stuff’s going to disintegrate 
like that, it’s not worth even 
what little I paid for it. After 
that trouble with the tele- 
vision set . Say, what hap- 
pened to the television set? 
I’ll bet Ken took it with him !” 

“And to think I almost mar- 
ried him!” shuddered Lorene. 

On the way to the bargain 
basement, Jack explained to 
Lorene what Ken had told 
him: how the bargain base- 
ment existed in the future, 
and the door to it was a fault 
in time. 

They passed Wing Fan’s 
laundry and turned into the 
alley. They went down the 
steps to the basement door and 
opened it. 

A blank wall of raw earth 
met their eyes. 

• “What in blazes!” exclaim- 
ed Jack. 

There were footsteps in the 
alley above them. Old man 
Caswell came down the steps 
with a policeman in tow. 

“My basement!” Caswell 
was complaining bitterly, al- 
most shouting. “I was going to 
rent it today, and somebody 
fills it up with dirt. Why, I ask 
you, why? Why would any- 
body want to fill my basement 
with dirt?” 

He caught sight of Jack and 
Lorene standing to one side. 

“You !” he cried. “You have 
anything to do with this?” 

“Absolutely nothing,” Jack 
assured him. “I thought there 
was a store here.” 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




“Store!” snorted Caswell. 
“Dirt!” 

Jack and Lorene got away 
and made their way bade to 
the street. 

“Was there really a store 
there, Jack?” she asked. 

“We’re really married, 
aren’t we, honey? I mean yes, 
there was. I don’t know what 
happened.” 

He looked at her, smiling, 
and the smile faded. 

“Oh, oh,” he said slowly. “I 
think I know now.” 

“What?” 

“I know now who Edigo 
Adaman reminded me of. 
You!” 

H E DIDN’T tell her the rest. 

He didn’t tell her he was 
almost sure that, the way 
things would have been, Lo- 
rene and Ken would have been 
married and Edigo would have 
been their descendant. 

But Edigo had changed all 
that when he sold Jack a 
drug that Jack used, to make 
sure that Ken wouldn’t marry 
Lorene, but that he would in- 



stead. And since Ken and Lo- 
rene wouldn’t be married now, 
Edigo would never be born, 
and would never have the idea 
of building a fifty-story build- 
ing at that spot, starting it by 
digging a basement. 

So that was what happened 
to the suit and Ken’s car and 
the television set. Since the 
basement wasn’t to be built 
there, they wouldn’t be, so 
they weren’t — they never had 
been. 

The strange thing about it 
was that Jack remembered it 
all, and even stranger, he was 
still married to Lorene, and 
he wouldn’t have been except 
for the drug. But then that 
had to be, because if he hadn’t 
married her, she’d have mar- 
ried Ken — and then the base- 
ment would have been, and 
he’d have gotten the drug, and 
Ken wouldn’t have married 
Lorene because Jack would 
have, and then there wouldn’t 
have been any basement . 

Jack sighed. He was happy 
that the circle stopped where 
it did. END 



A lot has been said about centralizing military R&D (research and de- 
velopment) as a separate civilian activity. Clifford D. Rassweiler, presi- 
dent of the American Chemical Society, has a better idea. He wants us 
to have a fourth branch of the military outside the Army, Navy, and 
Air Force for this purpose. Such a service would provide incentives for 
officers to devote their careers to R&D — which is not possible under the 
present system. John L. Burns, president of RCA, goes one step further. 
Burns says ... a fourth branch of government is necessary. Ranking 
in importance with the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, the 
“Permanent Council on Plans and Policies” ... its function: to look 
into the future.

BARGAIN BASEMENT

Homecoming 

By GORDON R. DICKSON 
Returning to the planet of 
his birth , Jeb was prepared 
for all changes .. .in people, 
society, customs . but not 
for this change in Customs'. 



A S THEY came to the top 
of the ramp, Jeb Halvor- 
sen felt the little hand of the 
krillian thrust into his own. 
He looked down and saw that 
the small Danibor marsupial- 
oid was shrinking against him 
the way a child might. 

“It’s all right, Tommy,” he 
said soothingly. “I’m not go- 
ing to go off and leave you.” 
“I’m good,” said Tommy, 
turning the large eyes in his 
narrow, kangaroolike face up 
to Jeb. 





67 






“I know you are.” Jeb 
reached over with his free 
hand and patted the round 
furry head that came to a 
little below his belt. “Don’t 
worry now. These are only hu- 
man people like you knew 
back on Danibor. It’s just 
that there’s a lot more of 
them here on Earth. They 
won’t hurt you; and anyway, 
I’ll take care of you. Come on. 
We go this way.” 

They turned to their left, 
down the long, echoing, pil- 
lared distance of Customs 
Row with its alphabetical di- 
visions. The ramp they had 
taken up from the landing 
area of the ship that had just 
brought them in from Dani- 
bor and Alpha Centauri had 
brought them out in the K sec- 
tion. It was a short stroll 
to the H section where Jeb’s 
luggage would be delivered. 

In fact when they got there 
the luggage had already ar- 
rived. It stood piled in a 
rough pyramid of boxes and 
cases all but identical with the 
similar stacks of luggage on 
the ruled squares about it. 
They went to it, passing a 
pleasant-faced young blonde 
girl who occupied the square 
to their right. 

“Now you wait here,” Jeb 
told Tommy. “I’ve got to go 
get a ticket. I’ll be right back. 
Stay with the luggage.” 

H E TURNED and went off, 
threading his way be- 
tween the piled-up squares of 



luggage back to the rear wall 
of the section. A stack of large 
plastic numbers was hanging 
on a hook there. He took the 
top one — it was number 
eighteen — and carried it back 
to the square where Tommy 
waited beside his luggage. 

Tommy was sitting down 
with his back against a suit- 
case, his eyes enormous on the 
blonde girl on the next square, 
who was trying to talk to him. 
Her face, animated now in 
conversation, had glowed into 
unexpected prettiness. She 
was a small girl and very 
white-skinned, as if she had 
spent months out of any sun- 
light whatsoever. 

“He’s cute,” she said, look- 
ing up as Jeb approached. 
“He’s not Earth-native, is 
he?” 

“No, he’s a mutant vari- 
form of Danibor in the Vegan 
system. His parent strain was 
Onychogale — nail-tailed wal- 
labies, a sort of kangaroo,” 
said Jeb. “They were mutated 
to provide a balanced ecology 
on Danibor — but this one’s a 
personal pet of mine.” 

“I never had a pet when I 
was little — ” she said, a little 
sadly, looking down at the 
krillian. Then she smiled at 
Tommy. “Would you like to 
come back to Mercury and be 
my pet someday?” 

“No,” said Tommy, and the 
transient glow of her smile 
was suddenly wiped away by 
shock. She looked up, hurt, at 
Jeb.

GORDON R. DICKSON 




“It’s all right,” said Jeb. 
“He didn’t really understand 
you. This variform can talk a 
little, but they’re still not 
much brighter than a young 
chimp, say, though they’ve 
got a dog’s desire to please. 
They’re awfully affectionate.” 
He put a hand gently on Tom- 
my’s head. “You get attached 
to them.” 

She smiled again, from him 
to Tommy. She leaned over 
and held out her hand. After 
a moment the krillian reached 
out and grasped it trustfully 
with his own small fingers. 

“I’m good,” said Tommy. 

“I’m sure you are," she 
said. “Good as gold.” She 
looked up at Jeb. “Are you 
Daniborian? Or are you from 
Earth?” 

Jeb smiled a little twistedly. 

“I’m buying my way back,” 
he said. 

“Oh.” She colored a little. 

“It’s nothing I’m ashamed 
of,” said Jeb. “I was shipped 
out on a surplus-population 
draft like lots of people 
you’ve known yourself. And 
I’m coming back on a talent- 
and-funds immigration visa. 
You’re Earth yourself?” 

“Yes,” she answered. “I’ve 
lived most of my life on Mer- 
cury — but we never lost our 
citizenship here. My father 
was a transfer engineer on 
loan from a Baltimore com- 
pany to its New Mercury 
branch.” She hesitated. “Can 
I ask what your talent is?” 

“Sound engineering,” Jeb 



said. “I came up with a few 
new wrinkles in the field. The 
funds part of it came from a 
little device I patented to con- 
trol noise levels on city streets. 
You know how this re-entry 
business works, don’t you?” 
“No. How?” She was watch- 
ing him interestedly. 

“To satisfy the funds re- 
quirement, you have to put up 
a bond in International Earth 
Credits. To get that type of 
currency, you have to have 
something that you can sell or 
hock on Earth itself. I hocked 
my rights to the noise-level- 
control patent.” 

She opened her mouth to 
say something further, but at 
that moment a Customs in- 
spector came threading his 
way among the squares, call- 
ing out, “Number fifteen!” 
“That’s me,” she said, turn- 
ing away quickly. She held up 
her hand. “Over here, offi- 
cer!” 

T HE Customs man came to- 
ward her. Tommy had 
escaped from her grasp while 
she was talking to Jeb and 
was now over on the other 
side of their pile of luggage, 
sniffing and staring about in- 
terestedly. Two more numbers 
were called in quick succes- 
sion, and then came, “Eight- 
een!” 

Jeb held up his hand. “Over 
here !” 

The Customs officer who 
approached was a stocky, 
thin-haired man with a dark- 



HOMECOMING 69 




ly tanned face and a pleasant 
smile. He shifted his record 
board into the crook of his 
arm as he came up and punch- 
ed for a new entry. 

“Name?” he said. “Place of 
departure? Planetality? Open 
your luggage, please — we 
aren’t allowed to touch them 
until you do so.” 

His fingers punched rapid- 
ly, taking down Jeb’s an- 
swers, as Jeb went about the 
pile of luggage, spreading it 
out and snapping the cases 
open. The officer followed 
him, peering at the contents of 
each, punching out his record 
and keeping up a small string 
of conversation. 

“ — nothing to declare ? 
Right. What have you got 
here ?” 

“It’s some of my Danibor- 
ian clothes,” said Jeb. “I was 
told I could bring in my own 
personal apparel.” 

“That’s all right,” said the 
Customs officer. “Native wool- 
ens, though. You’ll have to 
declare that you have no in- 
tention of reselling them. 
Wools got quite a snob value 
Earthside these days. Do you 
so declare?” 

“Sure,” said Jeb. “I wanted 
them mainly as souvenirs. 
These pipes too — ” 

“That’s all right. All these 
things, you understand, have 
a certain value because they 
are off-planet in origin. 
What’s in the metal case?” 
Jeb opened it, revealing the 
neatly racked rows of spools. 

70 



“Scientific library and rec- 
ords of some work I’ve been 
doing,” he answered. 

“I’ll put them down as so 
declared. You assure me that 
in this library there are no 
items of seditious or immoral 
literature, or anything other- 
wise forbidden to importation 
under the Earth United law?” 

“I do,” said Jeb. “And that 
about winds it up, except for 
this case here.” He opened it. 
“Odds and ends I’ve got kind 
of attached to.” 

The officer looked over a 
collection of articles ranging 
from a paper knife to a pipe 
reamer. 

“That’s all right,” he grin- 
ned. “As long as you haven’t 
a diamond or two tucked away 
amongst it.” 

“Give you my word,” said 
Jeb, smiling back. “The whole 
lot isn’t worth ten Universal 
Units.” 

“I believe you,” said the 
officer. “You should see some 
of the junk people have paid 
a couple of hundred light- 
years’ worth of freight on 
that comes through here. All 
right.” He punched the last 
few of his buttons. “You 
haven’t any Daniborian fruit, 
vegetables, seeds, spores, or 
other vegetation about your 
person or your luggage?” 

“Not a one,” said Jeb. 

“Then sign here.” He pre- 
sented the record board to 
Jeb. “Thumbprint to the right 
of your signature. That’s fine. 
I’ll go file this now, and as 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




soon as it’s taken up, your 
luggage will be delivered to 
the central city depot. You 
can pick it up there.” 

“Thanks,” said Jeb. “Thank 
you very much. You’ve been a 
lot less rough about some of 
this stuff than I expected.” 
“Oh, we’re human, too,” 
said the officer. “Though to 
listen to some of the stories 
you hear about us — ” Step- 
ping back, he almost stum- 
bled over Tommy, who had 
just then come around the 
stack of luggage after visiting 
a neighboring pile during the 
inspection. “Oops!” 

“That’s all right,” said Jeb. 
“You didn’t hurt him. Say 
hello to the officer, Tommy.” 

B UT Tommy merely sat and 
stared up at the Custom’s 
man with wide-eyed curiosity. 
And the Customs man looked 
back down at him with no less 
interest. 

“What is he?” the officer 
asked. “Some sort of kan- 
garoo? He’s yours, isn’t he?” 
“Yes,” said Jeb. “No, he’s 
not a real kangaroo. He’s a 
krillian. He’d speak to you 
when I tell him, but he’s hav- 
ing too much fun right now 
looking at your uniform orna- 
ments. Tommy, say hello to 
the man.” 

“What’s a krillian? I never 
heard of one,” said the inspec- 
tor. “Some species native to 
Danibor?” 

“No, he’s a variform — a 
mutant, you know — of the 

HOMECOMING 



nail-tailed wallaby here on 
Earth. They bred them to — ” 
Jeb broke off suddenly. “Is 
something wrong?” 

The officer was frowning. 

“I don’t know,” he said. 
“Wait here just a minute, will 
you, please?” He turned and 
disappeared among the lug- 
gage piles, back in the direc- 
tion of the Customs office for 
their alphabetical sector. 

“Hi,” said a voice. Jeb 
turned. It was the blonde girl 
on the next square. “How are 
you and Tommy coming? I’m 
all finished.” 

“We are too, I guess,” an- 
swered Jeb slowly. “The offi- 
cer just told us to wait a 
minute until he came back.” 
He looked at the girl. Her 
face was flushed with pleasure 
and quite appealing. 

“They’re nice, aren’t they?” 
said the girl. “I expected all 
kinds of trouble over some 
gifts I was bringing in. Oh, 
not real trouble, I mean, but 
red tape and signing papers 
and bonds and stuff. But he 
just waved it off. How was 
your man?” 

“Nice guy,” said Jeb. 

“Now my vacation starts,” 
said the girl. “Three months 
of it and then I’ll be going to 
college on the West Coast. 
Now that it’s really here, and 
I’m really in, I’m ready to 
burst with excitement.” 

“Play with me, please?” 
said Tommy, from beneath 
them, putting up a hand to 
clutch at her skirt. 

71 




She smiled radiantly down 
at him. “Of course I’ll play 
with you, Tommy ! What 
would you like to play?” 

“Play tag?” said Tommy, 
bounding suddenly up into the 
air as if propelled by a spring 
like a jack-in-the-box, and 
coming down on top of one of 
the luggage cases. 

“Not now, Tommy,” said 
Jeb. “There isn’t room to play 
tag here.” 

Tommy’s slender ears 
drooped slightly. “Tag?” he 
said wistfully. 

“No!” snapped Jeb. 

Tommy’s reaction was in- 
stantaneous. He almost cring- 
ed, and Jeb, immediately 
remorseful, put out a hand to 
stroke the soft head. 

“It’s all right, boy,” he said. 
“I’m not mad at you. It’s just 
that we can’t play tag right 
now.” 

“I love you,” said Tommy, 
putting out a sudden pink 
tongue to kiss Jeb’s caressing 
hand. 

“I know. I love you, too,” 
said Jeb automatically. He 
was aware suddenly that the 
girl’s eyes were on him, and 
that they were shining with 
tears. 

“I’m sorry,” she said, dab- 
bing at them with a small 
handkerchief. “It’s just that 
today is — so much and every- 
thing — and then the two of 
you . 

“Well,” said Jeb awkward- 
ly. 

Over the heads of the sur- 



rounding crowd and the tops 
of the luggage piles, he saw 
relief coming. 

“Here’s our officer now,” he 
said. 

The girl turned to look. 
“There’s somebody with 
him,” she said. 

A ND indeed there was an- 
other man just behind the 
one who had checked Jeb’s 
luggage, a slightly heavier, 
older man with graying hair 
and the silver bar of a senior 
lieutenant in the Customs 
service on the shoulders of 
his uniform. They both came 
up to where Jeb, the girl and 
Tommy were standing. The 
lieutenant was carrying some 
papers in one hand and he 
seemed harassed. 

“Mr. Halvorsen?” he said. 
“Yes,” said Jeb. 

“This is your entry permit 
for a Daniborian marsupial- 
oid?” He showed a sheet. 
“Yes.” Jeb frowned at him. 
“Well — uh — perhaps we 
better step back into my office 
for a minute. You can go, 
Harry.” The Customs officer 
turned and left. “This way, 
Mr. Halvorsen. Bring the 
marsupialoid with you, will 
you, please?” 

“Here, Tommy,” said Jeb. 
He took Tommy’s hand and 
began to follow the lieutenant 
back toward the Customs of- 
fices. He felt a tug at his elbow 
and turned, still walking, to 
see the girl hurrying along 
behind them. 



72 



GORDON R. DICKSON 




“What is it?” asked the 
girl. “Is something wrong?” 

“I don’t think so,” said Jeb. 

“Can I come along?” 

“I don’t see why not.” 

The lieutenant led them 
into a large room where a 
number of the Customs offi- 
cers were busy at work, re- 
cording and checking; and 
through this room into a 
smaller office with a desk and 
several easy chairs facing it. 

“If you’ll sit down for a 
minute, Mr. Halvorsen — ” 
The lieutenant saw the girl 
and the eyebrows on his 
round, not unpleasant face 
went up. “Miss — ?” 

“She’s with us,” said Jeb. 

“Not in your party?” said 
the lieutenant. 

“No. Just a friend. You 
don’t mind?” spoke up the 
girl, quickly and a little 
breathlessly. 

“I — suppose not. Well, sit 
down, please,” said the lieu- 
tenant, seating himself be- 
hind the desk and spreading 
out the papers upon it. “Mr. 
Halvorsen, this entry permit 
of yours for the marsupialoid 
— name Tommy — ” he glanc- 
ed at Tommy, who was sitting 
high beside Jeb’s chair and 
peering over the desk surface 
at him — “it was made out on 
Danibor.” 

“All my papers were, of 
course,” said Jeb. “Why? 
Something the matter with 
them?” 

“No. Not with them. Not 
even with this.” The lieuten- 



ant twitched the entry permit 
for Tommy. “The form’s 
proper and made out correct- 
ly. It’s just — well, I feel 
rather bad about this, Mr. 
Halvorsen. You’ve been the 
victim of a mistake on the 
part of whoever issued this 
permit back on Danibor.” 

“What mistake?” Jeb’s 
voice came out with a harsh- 
ness that surprised him. 

“I can understand you not 
knowing, but there’s no ex- 
cuse for whoever’s in charge 
of the office on Danibor. This 
form has been removed from 
the lists.” 

“Is that all?” Jeb could not 
help smiling a bit. 

“You don’t understand,” 
said the lieutenant, hitching 
his chair forward. “The form 
has been dropped because 
there’s now a law against re- 
introducing any of the mutat- 
ed variforms to Earth.” 

J EB stared at him. “Earth is 
where they come from in 
the first place.” 

“I know.” The lieutenant 
waved a wide, slightly em- 
barrassed hand. “But it’s a 
genetic matter — not merely 
the variforms themselves, but 
what sort of disease muta- 
tions they may have developed 
on other worlds. Especially 
over several generations.” He 
coughed, gazing at Tommy. 
“He is a cute little fellow, 
isn’t he?” He smiled at Tom- 
my, suddenly became serious 
and turned again to Jeb. “The 



HOMECOMING 



73 




law was passed half a dozen 
years ago. A mutated virus 
that attacked Earth life could 
be a problem to an overcrowd- 
ed world like this.” 

“But wouldn’t a virus that 
attacked Earth life attack 
early imports of Earth life on 
the world where it first ap- 
peared?” Jeb put his hands on 
the edge of the desk. “There’s 
fresh, unmutated life — peo- 
ple, stock, vegetation — being 
shipped out to all the colony 
worlds all the time. They’d be 
the first to catch it.” 

“Well, possibly — I don’t 
know all the ins and outs of 
it,” said the lieutenant. “May- 
be there were other reasons, 
too. I don’t know. It’s not my 
job to justify the law, only to 
enforce it.” He looked at 
Tommy again. “I’m sorry. I 
know he must be quite a pet. 
I’ve a dog myself at home.” 
He returned his attention to 
the desk and shifted the 
papers, stacking them togeth- 
er neatly. 

“This is crazy!” burst out 
Jeb. “Look, the permit was 
issued. There must be some 
way around this. Tommy’s not 
like a dog — he’s more intelli- 
gent, for one thing. And he’s 
lived' with me for eight years. 
We were alone together out at 
a survey station on Danibor. 
He couldn’t live without 
me — 

“I’m sorry,” said the lieu- 
tenant. His face softened, be- 
came sympathetic and con- 
cerned. “Look, you don’t 



understand. According to a 
strict interpretation of the or- 
der, I should order him de- 
stroyed — ” 

“Oh, no!” It was the girl’s 
voice crying out suddenly. 

Tommy jerked up his ears 
and hopped hastily over to 
her. He licked at her face. 

“Don’t cry,” Tommy said in 
distress. 

She put her arms out and 
hugged him protectively. 

“Please,” said the lieuten- 
ant. “It’s not me. It’s the law. 
The law forbids the importa- 
tion of variforms and orders 
them destroyed where they’re 
found on Earth. It’s not that 
bad for you. I’ll give you a 
couple of hours to decide what 
you want to do about it.” He 
nodded at Tommy. “If you 
can find some means of get- 
ting it off Earth in that time, 
I’ll let it go.” 

“You were calling him he a 
few seconds ago,” said Jeb be- 
tween his teeth. 

“Was I?” said the lieuten- 
ant. “It doesn’t matter. My 
duty stays the same. And if 
you’re thinking of asking me, 
or bribing me, to forget the 
law and let him slip by the 
basis of the entry permit — 
please don’t make it embar- 
rassing for both of us.” He got 
up from his desk and crossed 
to the door. “I’ll give you a 
couple of hours. Until then, 
no pass to leave the Customs 
area will be issued to you.” 

“I think I hate you,” said 
the girl.

GORDON R. DICKSON 




“You don’t understand — 
either of you,” he said gently. 
“There’s no room for excep- 
tions to the rules nowadays. 
There’s too many of us 
crowded together on Earth 
for that.” He went out, paus- 
ing a second in the doorway, 
with his hand on the door but- 
ton. “You’ll save yourself a 
great deal if you give up and 
turn it over to be destroyed 
now,” he said to Jeb. 

“The hell I will!” cried Jeb 
savagely at the closing door. 

It clicked shut. He turned 
to the girl and then to Tom- 
my with fury on his face. 

“The hell with it,” he re- 
peated. “We’ll get out of this 
place, both of us.” 

She looked at him, as if 
across some sort of abyss. 

“You know you can’t leave,” 
she said. 

H E OPENED his lips fu- 
riously to speak. But the 
words died somewhere inside 
him and after a second he 
closed his mouth again with- 
out saying anything. 

“I know,” she said, “how 
hard it is to get back to Earth 
after you’ve lost your citizen- 
ship. I’ve heard them talk. My 
father says it’s like climbing 
a mountain that gets higher 
every day.” 

“Yes,” he said emptily. 

He got to his feet and walk- 
ed across the office to a win- 
dow on the far side that 
looked beyond the Customs 
building to the first, light, 

HOMECOMING 



soaring buildings of the city 
beyond. 

“I’ll ship him back to Dani- 
bor,” he said. 

She played with Tommy's 
ears tenderly. 

“Don’t you have friends 
back there who’d take him — ” 

“I guess so,” he said. “Brad 
Alokua — he’d take Tommy. 
Tommy likes him.” He turned 
back to the doorway. “I’ll go 
over to Shipping and arrange 
it.” He held out his hand, and 
Tommy, leaving the girl, 
hopped to him and took it. 

“Come on, boy,” he said, 
and went out. The girl fol- 
lowed after. 

They crossed the wide area 
that belonged to Customs and 
took a walkway to the Out- 
bound area. Here, as at Cus- 
toms, the destinations were 
arranged alphabetically. They 
went to the desk that handled 
Aldebaran through Evenside. 

“Where to?” asked a clerk, 
coming up on his side of the 
desk as they approached. He 
was a lean, young man with 
dark hair and more of a local 
accent than the Customs offi- 
cer or the lieutenant had 
shown. 

“Danibor — ” began Jeb. 

“Papers?” The clerk held 
out his hand. 

“No, it’s not for me,” said 
Jeb. “I just came in from 
Danibor. But I’ve found out 
that I can’t bring my kril- 
lian in with me. I want to ship 
him back.” 

The clerk dropped his hand 

75 




and, turning slowly, stared 
down at Tommy. 

“This here?” he said. “Is 
that a krillian?” 

“Yes,” said Jeb, a little 
shortly. 

“No offense,” said the clerk. 
“I’ve just never seen one. So 
you want to ship him back. 
You’re a Daniborian your- 
self?” He opened a drawer 
before him and took papers 
out of it, laying them on the 
top of the desk. 

“With an Earth immigra- 
tion visa,” said Jeb. 

“Your Daniborian citizen- 
ship’s still in effect then, un- 
til your final papers are 
issued.” The clerk stamped 
several blanks on the papers. 
“Weight of krillian ?” 

“Twenty-three point four 
kilos.” 

“Fine,” said the clerk, 
finishing off his papers. 
“Shipping fee will be — let’s 
see — fourteen hundred and 
thirty-nine International 
Earth Credits.” 

Jeb sat still for a moment. 
The clerk looked up. 

“So much?” asked Jeb. 
“That’s right.” 

“When we came out — ” 

“I know,” said the clerk. 
“Everything was a lot lower 
in price. It’s a matter of ship- 
ping space. The heavy traffic 
is outbound from Earth, so 
the freight and passenger 
fees are high. Coming in 
from Danibor, there was 
plenty of space, so — ” 

He shrugged. 



J EB felt a touch on his el- 
bow. He turned around 
and saw the girl leaning to- 
ward him. 

“I could help out,” she said. 
He swallowed hard. “Thank 
you.” 

She passed him a small wad 
of notes. He dug out his own 
money case and counted the 
contents. He was four hun- 
dred and thirty short. He took 
them from her fold of money 
and returned what was left to 
her. 

“Thanks,” he said, with 
difficulty. “I’ll pay you back.” 
“It doesn’t matter,” she 
said. “Really it doesn’t.” 

He passed the money over 
to the clerk, who counted it 
and put it into an envelope, 
which he sealed. 

“All right,” said Jeb. 
“Where do we take him 
now?” 

“Take him? Oh — ” said the 
clerk. He consulted a paper on 
the side of his desk. “You’re 
in luck. Bring him back in 
three weeks to this desk here. 
I’ll give you a pass and direc- 
tions to the Shipping area — ” 
“Three weeks!” 

Startled, the clerk looked up 
at him. 

“Why, yes—” 

“But we’ve got to ship him 
off inside of two hours!” cried 
Jeb. 

The clerk blinked at him. 
“Oh, that’s impossible,” he 
said at last. He even smiled, a 
little uncertainly. “You’re not 
serious. Even if a ship was 



76 



GORDON R. DICKSON 




leaving today, it’d take five 
hours to have him taken 
aboard — ” 

“But we’ve got to get him 
off!” Jeb’s voice rang harshly 
out over the area, and at 
a neighboring desk another 
clerk and his customer looked 
over to see what the matter 
was. “Three weeks — that’s 
crazy. I just came in on a ship 
that must be going back soon- 
er than that.” 

“Oh, the Dancia,” said the 
clerk. “She’s going out this 
afternoon. But she’s all emi- 
grant this trip. No room for 
freight.” 

“Tommy didn’t come as 
freight. He came in my 
cabin.” 

“Well, there you are.” The 
clerk spread his hands on the 
desk like a reasonable man. 
“If you were taking him back 
personally — but you couldn’t 
on this ship unless you were 
emigrating.” 

Jeb sat glowering at the 
clerk. A sudden touch on his 
elbow made him turn. The 
girl’s face was urgently close 
to his. 

“My family — ” she said. 
“On Mercury. We could send 
Tommy to them.” 

“Mercury? Great!” Jeb 
leaped gladly to his feet. 
“Which way — ” 

“Down at the end of the 
row here,” said the clerk, 
pointing away to Jeb’s left. 

Jeb saw, diminutive in the 
distance, a hanging sign pro- 
claiming PLANETS OF THE 

HOMECOMING 



solar system. He turned and 
went swiftly toward it, hear- 
ing the quick clicking of the 
girl’s heels catching up be- 
hind him. Tommy bounced 
happily alongside. 

“Race?” he said, looking up 
at Jeb. “Race me?” 

“Not now, Tommy.” 

T HE Inner Planets section 
was a good four long city 
blocks away. When at last 
they arrived at it, warm and 
breathing hard, both of the 
humans, they found under the 
enormous floating overhead 
sign a multitude of desks. 

“This way!” The girl pulled 
him forward to a desk. 

“Sit down, please,” said the 
clerk — a woman this time, 
about middle age. She smiled 
at all of them, and particular- 
ly Tommy, who warmed to 
her interest. 

“I’m good,” he informed 
her. 

The clerk’s sudden startle- 
ment was interrupted by the 
girl. Words tumbling urgently 
from her lips, she explained 
the situation. The older wom- 
an’s face gentled. 

“Of course, honey,” she 
said, patting the girl’s hand 
and reaching into her desk. 
She came up with a sheaf of 
papers. “The next ship for 
Mercury doesn’t leave for six 
hours. But once you get him 
aboard, no one’ll touch him. 
Now you give me your par- 
ents’ name and their home ad- 
dress.” 

77 




T HE girl produced her 
papers. The clerk nodded 
to the sound of the girl’s 
voice, taking down the neces- 
sary information, while Jeb 
stood back, feeling at once re- 
lief, and a sensation of lost- 
ness, as if he had been betray- 
ed into a wilderness, caught 
up in something beyond his 
own and proper control. 

“Here — ” he started to say. 
And then he stopped. He had 
nothing to tell them. And any- 
way, occupied as they were, 
they had not heard him. 

Tommy’s small, tight grip 
closed on the fingers of Jeb’s 
right hand. He patted the kril- 
lian on the head absently. 
There was something unreal 
about this whole business. 
They would ship Tommy off 
to Mercury — to a good home. 
And after that? Jeb would 
make the hop from time to 
time . 

No, he could not make it 
seem real. 

“All right,” the woman be- 
hind the desk was saying. She 
handed Jeb a paper. He took 
it numbly. He had planned 
and worked to come back to 
Earth from the day he had 
seen that he must go out in an 
emigrant draft . 

“What?” he said. 

“ — off to your right there,” 
the woman was repeating. 
“Back to the Delivery area, 
Freight, Section C, Livestock. 
You’ll find it all right.” 

“Thanks.” Slowly Jeb stood 
up. 

78 



“Come on,” said the girl. 
She led the way off. 

A short distance off, among 
the many faces and bodies of 
the crowd, they found the 
area they were looking for. 
There was a counter with an 
entryway in it and behind it 
a wall pierced by a door la- 
beled TO LOADING SECTION. 
The man behind the desk took 
the papers from Jeb in silence 
and read them, stamping this 
section and detaching that. 

“All right,” he said. He was 
a lean man in his forties. 
“This the one?” He reached 
over the counter for Tommy, 
and Tommy drew back. “Shy, 
eh?” He turned and came 
around through the entryway. 
“Is he vicious?” 

"No!” said Jeb sharply. 

The man shrugged at him. 
“Maybe you better tell him 
he’s to go with me. It helps 
sometimes.” 

Jeb looked down. Tommy 
was pressed close against his 
leg. 

“Tommy,” he said. Tommy 
looked up. “Tommy, you go 
with the man here.” 

Tommy stared up at Jeb, 
his eyes enormous. He did not 
move. 

“Tommy—” 

“Probably,” said the man, 
“I better just — ” His hands 
moved swiftly and abruptly to 
snatch up Tommy — and in 
that same second Tommy 
turned and clung with all of 
his strength to Jeb’s leg. 

“Tommy — ’’said Jeb. “Tom- 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




my — Let go, will you!” he 
exploded at the man. 

The man let go and 
straightened up, his lean face 
a little darkened and hotly 
flushed. 

“Tommy,” said Jeb, closing 
his hands gently but firmly 
around the slim forearms of 
the krillian. “Tommy, listen 
now. It’s all right. You’ve just 
got to go with him, that’s all.” 
He felt the small, warm arms, 
downy-soft with their fine 
fur, clinging piteously to him. 
“Tommy, please!” 

A DOUBLE shock wave, of 
cold, then hot, washed 
through Jeb. In one twin flash 
of vision he saw the new, raw 
cities of Danibor and the long 
dream of Earth. 

“Let go!” he snarled, and 
wrenched at Tommy. The 
furry arms pulled away a lit- 
tle, but clung. 

“I’ll get him for you,” said 
the man. “There’s a simpler 
way.” He bent down and 
clamped his hand over Tom- 
my’s muzzle, closing the 
mouth and nostrils. “When he 
starts to strangle, he’ll let 
go.” 

Tommy made no effort to 
fight the hand. He only press- 
ed as close to Jeb’s leg as pos- 
sible and hung on. 

“ Stop it!’’ screamed the 
girl. 

Both men started suddenly 
and the man from Shipping 
let go, and they looked at her. 
“Can’t you see he isn’t go- 



ing to? Can’t you see he’ll die 
first?” she cried. 

“He won’t die,” muttered 
the man. “Just pass out and 
relax, that’s all.” 

“You!” She turned on Jeb. 
“How can you do that? It just 
won’t — it just won’t work.” 

Jeb was petting Tommy’s 
head automatically. His hand 
trembled a little. 

“Look, I can’t fool around 
all afternoon,” said the man. 
“Bring him in yourself if you 
want to.” 

“No.” Jeb found his voice. 
“Go on.” The man frowned at 
him. “I said go on. It’s all 
right. I mean we’re not send- 
ing him right now, after all.” 
He swallowed. 

The man looked at Jeb, 
turned to take a long look at 
the girl, turned again without 
a word, and went. They 
watched him pass again be- 
hind the counter. 

“It’s all right, Tommy, it’s 
all right now,” Jeb was say- 
ing. 

Tommy slowly let go. Jeb 
picked him up and looked past 
one quivering furry shoulder 
at the girl. 

“You could go with him!” 
she flung out. 

“To Mercury?” said Jeb 
harshly. “What’s on Mercury 
for me? I might as well go 
back to Danibor.” 

“Just to leave him there — ” 

“We’d still have to split up 
sometime !” he said, taking his 
own anger out on her. 
“What’s the use of delaying?”

He turned about and started 
to stride off. 

“Where are you going?” 
She was running after him, 
alongside him, almost crying. 

“Back to that Customs lieu- 
tenant,” he said, staring 
straight ahead. “It’s up to 
him.” 

They threaded their way 
back through the indifferent 
crowds to the Customs section 
and the office of the lieuten- 
ant. 

The lieutenant glanced up 
from his desk as they entered, 
his gray, calm eyes swiftly un- 
derstanding. 

“Too bad,” he said. 

“There must be some solu- 
tion!” the girl burst out. 
“There mustl” 

The lieutenant got up from 
behind his desk. He went over 
and opened another door to an 
inner office. 

“Tommy,” he said, “you 
wait in here.” 

Tommy stayed still, close to 
Jeb. 

“It’s all right, Tommy,” 
said Jeb, with a dry mouth. 
“It’s all right this time. I’ll be 
in.” 

S LOWLY Tommy moved 
away from them and into 
the room. The lieutenant shut 
the door on him and returned 
to his desk. 

“Sit down,” he said. 

“But there must be some 
way!” cried the girl. 

The lieutenant turned to 
face her. 

80 



“You ought to know bet- 
ter,” he said. “You’re from 
the Inner Planets.” He consid- 
ered her. “No, you’re too 
young. You don’t realize.” 

“I realize there must be 
some kind of solution that 
doesn’t mean killing him be- 
cause nobody can wait more 
than an hour to find one !” she 
flared at him. 

“That’s where you’re 
wrong,” said the lieutenant. 
“That’s where you’re com- 
pletely wrong.” 

“How?” she challenged him. 
“The situation is urgent,” 
the lieutenant said, “exactly 
because it’s a situation. No, 
you don’t understand. You’re 
from Mercury — well, that’s 
out a little way from the busi- 
ness of Earth. And your par- 
ents must have kept you 
wrapped up safe from the 
hard facts of life. Halvorsen 
here I don’t blame. Being 
from a frontier planet where 
there’s no urgency, he would 
not know. But you should.” 
“There’s no danger.” She 
glared at him. “You don’t 
even know yourself of a good 
reason for the ruling.” 

“It doesn’t matter whether 
the ruling’s good or not. Now 
listen.” He spoke almost kind- 
ly. “This is the hub of our uni- 
verse here, Earth. This is 
where all the big work, the 
big business goes on. Every- 
body wants to come here; no- 
body wants to leave. Ask Hal- 
vorsen.” He pointed his chin 
at Jeb. “So no single individ- 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




ual’s important here. It’s the 
room that’s important, the bit 
of ground you occupy. If you 
don’t want to play by the 
rules, somebody else’ll gladly 
take your place. There’s no 
room on Earth for the kan- 
garoo, but there is for Halvor- 
sen. He takes it or he doesn’t, 
and he takes it right now or 
his chance is over. All of us — 
me too — only hold our room 
as long as we stick by the 
rules. There are too many peo- 
ple and too little room for any- 
thing else.” 

“It’s not like that!” She 
was really starting to cry now. 
The tears made twin tracks 
down her young cheeks. 

Jeb looked away, but the 
lieutenant continued to stare 
gravely at her. 

“But it is,” he said. “Hal- 
vorsen’s got a brilliant future 
here — otherwise they would 
not have let him back. It’s 
worth the sacrifice of what- 
ever Earth asks of him. Right, 
Halvorsen ?” 

There was a moment of si- 
lence in the office. Even the 
girl, looking intently at Jeb, 
held her breath. 

“Right,” said Jeb in a low 
voice, looking at neither of 
them. 

“That’s correct,” said the 
lieutenant. “Believe me, I’m 
sorry for both you and Tom- 
my.” He opened the drawer 
of his desk. “I’m not the ogre 
you’d like to think me, miss. 
I just don’t have any choice 
— like the rest of you. Per- 



haps, Halvorsen, you’d rather 
take care of it yourself?” 

Jeb, looking up, saw the 
other extending a handgun to 
him across the desk. He hesi- 
tated a second, then took it, 
thrusting it inside the loose 
bulge of his tunic, where it 
was hidden. 

The girl sobbed. He went 
into the other office, closing 
the door behind him. 

T HE other office was deco- 
rated as a library, with 
one large window giving on 
the city. Tommy had been 
sniffing about the shelves of 
tapes, but he stopped and sat 
up with bright, intelligent in- 
terest as Jeb came in. 

“Go now?” asked Tommy. 
“Pretty soon,” said Jeb. He 
was surprised that his voice 
came out steady, though to his 
own ears it had a dead, 
strange ring, like the voice of 
someone he did not know. 
“Just a minute. Come over 
here, Tommy — to the win- 
dow.” 

He walked to the window 
and stood facing out. Tommy 
hopped over to stand beside 
him. 

“See?” Tommy asked. 
“Yes,” said Jeb. “Look 
down there, Tommy.” 

Together they gazed out at 
the far carpet of buildings 
rolling away to the horizon. 
The sight of them at last 
made Jeb catch his breath a 
little, in spite of himself. It 
was all there. Earth. 



HOMECOMING 



81 




“Trees?” Tommy was say- 
ing, breathing against the 
window. “Trees?” 

“There aren’t any trees, 
Tommy,” answered Jeb. 

“No trees?” 

“And no grass,” said Jeb. 
Tommy’s ears went back in 
disappointment. “No place 
down there for you to play.” 
With a little effort, Jeb con- 
jured up the picture of Tom- 
my, cramped and prisoned in 
an apartment. “It’s not much 
fun for a krillian here on 
Earth, Tommy. Not much fun 
at all.” 

“Sheep — ?” faltered Tom- 
my, in the faint tone of one 
who pleads for the realization 
of some smallest crumb of his 
hopes. 

“No, no — ” With a sudden 
start, Jeb came back to his 
purpose in this room. His 
voice hardened, the words ex- 
truding like steel between his 
teeth. “Yes, I think there are 
some sheep down there. See? 
Down there.” 

“Sheep?” Tommy’s ears 
flicked up and he pressed his 
nose to the pane of the win- 
dow eagerly. “Sheep?” 

“Don’t you see them?” said 
Jeb tightly. He reached into 
his tunic and drew out the 
gun. “Keep looking. Down 
there. See them?” He pointed 
the gun’s muzzle at the back 
of the small, furry head. 

“See? Sheep?” Tommy’s 
ears flicked in this direction 
and then that, like sema- 
phores. Jeb’s jaws were 

82 



clenched so tightly together 
they felt welded shut. The butt 
of the handgun slid a little in 
his slippery grip, and the 
muzzle end of the barrel wav- 
ered. 

“Keep looking, Tommy!” 
he said in a stifled voice. 
“Keep looking.” 

His finger tightened on the 
firing button. He could feel its 
half-marble roundness cold 
against the tip of his forefin- 
ger. 

The wavers of the barrel 
increased, built up until the 
whole arm was trembling 
violently. 

He laid arm and gun down 
on his other hand for a second 
to steady it, then lifted them 
again. He squinted like a man 
facing into a merciless sun- 
glare. His whole arm and 
shoulder were quivering. 

Suddenly, he threw the gun 
across the room. Startled, 
Tommy jerked around. 

Jeb let out a long breath in 
a sigh of exhaustion. 

“Nothing, Tommy,” he said. 
“Never mind.” He went 
across the room and picked up 
the gun. “I think the sheep 
are gone now. Let’s go back 
into the other room.” 

W ITH Tommy hopping 
ahead of him, they re- 
turned. As they came through 
the door, the lieutenant’s eye- 
brows went up. Jeb tossed the 
gun down on his desk. 

“We’re going back to Dani- 
bor,” he said in a tight voice. 

GORDON R. DICKSON 




“Both of us. On that emigrant 
ship.” 

A small female cyclone blew 
across the room into Jeb's 
arms and began crying wildly 
against his shoulder. Tommy 
was pogo-sticking with ex- 
citement all around him. Over 
the top of the blonde head 
pressed into his tunic, Jeb 
scowled furiously at the lieu- 
tenant. 

The lieutenant shook his 
head, putting the handgun 
back into the drawer of his 
desk. 

“It's your funeral,” he said, 
“if you want to give up your 
chance at Earth and every- 
thing it could do for you. Til 
bet you can't give me one 



good, logical reason for what 
you're doing.” 

“Maybe not,” said Jeb. “But 
it looks like we have two dif- 
ferent sets of standards about 
what's worth having, me, you, 
you home-planet people; and 
whether mine's better or not, 
I seem to be stuck with it.” 

“I love you!” cried Tommy, 
leaping up to lick Jeb's face, 
without the slightest idea of 
why this should be an emo- 
tional occasion, but convinced 
it was nonetheless. 

“Me too!” wept the girl. 
They both clung to Jeb. 
“Well,” said the lieutenant, 
“it takes all kinds to make a 
universe.” 

END 



Instead of worrying about dwindling fossil fuel reserves and radioactive 
nuclear plants, power engineers will be able to supply this country with 
free hydrogen fusion power from sea water. Americans will be able to 
have an almost completely automated life at low cost. 

All this before the end of the century, according to the Public Service 
Electric & Gas Co. in New Jersey. 

There are, of course, other dramatic possibilities latent in the oceans, 
should the above prediction prove overoptimistic : 

• Seaweed, with its exceptionally high vitamin content, should begin to 
provide food for both men and animals — and soon. Recent experiments 
indicate that livestock thrives on seaweed meal. Milk production in- 
creased in cows and the vitamin A content of their milk was greater. 
Hens laid better eggs; pigs fattened quicker; turkey mortality was re- 
duced. 

• Loose-lying metal-bearing ores are worth an estimated $1*4 million 
per square mile in some areas. These deposits and ways to recover them 
are being investigated by mineral engineers at the U. of California. 

• Scientists at Plymouth, England, have found appreciable quantities 
of the strategic niobium and vanadium in the flesh and blood of ascidians, 
a sea animal such as the skate.

By KIRBY KERR 



AN HONEST CREDIT 



It was just like Nick not 



to realize that it is bad 



luck to be superstitious! 



S LIPPERY Nick Fernell 
edged sideways along the 
sidewalk in front of the Third 
Blast, cautiously pushed the 
door open a crack and peeked 
in. There was a mob of cus- 
tomers — two dozen, maybe — 
and the big screen above the 
bar was blank. Slippery Nick 
clucked softly. 

With the rockets blasting 
out Asteroid Way, a blank 



screen meant that Ed the man- 
ager didn’t have any credits 
riding. Ed liked a quiet bar in 
the afternoon, and he never 
turned on the races when he 
wasn’t betting. So Nick had 
a ten-to-one chance. 

He slipped furtively 
through the doorway, eased 
his way to the bar in such a 
way that a congenial group of 
paying customers masked his 



84 




presence from Ed, and spoke 
softly to a bartender. 

“One Fission Fizz.” 

The bartender hesitated. 
“Cash or—” 

A blast from the other end 
of the bar rattled the glasses 
and silenced all conversation 
in the room. “Cash!” Ed thun- 
dered. 

Two dozen faces pivoted 
slowly and tensed at the sud- 
den strain as their respective 
pairs of eyes sought to focus 
on Nick. Nick cringed in em- 
barrassment. 

Ed moved his heavy body 
carefully along behind the bar, 
making a minor engineering 
project of getting his belly 
past two bartenders. He tower- 
ed over Slippery Nick. “There 
ain’t no or where he’s concern- 
ed,” he snarled. “Cash!” 

“Aw, Ed,” Nick whined. 
“One Fission Fizz . .” 

“Is the tenth part of a cred- 
it, and the answer is no — N, 0. 
I got principles, one of w r hich 
says I ain’t ever gonna be took 
for a hundred credits by Slip- 
pery Nick Fernell. You ran up 
twenty-three credits last week 
when I wasn’t around, and 
your account now stands at 
ninety-one credits. Which is 
ninety credits too much.” 

The customer on Nick’s 
left turned away, blinking, 
after a strenuous effort to 
make out Nick’s face. He was 
a skinny, pale-faced man with 
an overly long neck and thick 
contact lenses that made his 
eyes bulge fishlike. He shook 



his head violently, wiped his 
nose on his shirt sleeve, and 
turned his bleary eyes back to 
Nick. 

“Tough to be broke,” he 
muttered, dropping a ticket- 
sized piece of paper currency 
on the damp bar. “I know. 
Give him a Fission Fizz.” 

T HE bartender hesitated 
and glanced at Ed, who 
disdainfully turned his back. 
The bartender scraped the 
currency from the bar and slid 
a glass across to Nick. 

“Obliged,” Nick said pa- 
tronizingly. 

The benefactor leaned to- 
ward Nick and squinted. 
“Quite all right. Tough to be 
broke. The name’s Hullman.” 
“Fernell,” Slippery Nick 
said. “Course, I ain’t exactly 
broke ...” 

Ed sneered and banged a 
plastic bottle on the bar. 
“Course Nick ain’t broke. He 
ain’t earned no money since 
’92, and he owes every bar and 
every bookie this side of Pluto, 
but he’s got a damned knick- 
knack in his pocket, so he ain’t 
broke. I say if the only money 
a man has he won’t spend, he’s 
broke.” 

Nick winced. The Fission 
Fizz had set his body tingling, 
and he reared up angrily and 
pounded on the bar. “Knick- 
knack — he calls this a knick- 
knack!” He jerked at the 
string around his neck and 
brought forth a worn currency 
folder. He fumbled in it and 



85 




dropped something on the bar. 
It rang out sharply. 

“Hey, it’s metal !” exclaimed 
the customer on Nick’s right. 
“Metal money. A credit piece. 
I never saw one before.” He 
clamped a hairy hand on the 
coin and examined it with 
awe. 

“My lucky credit,” Nick 
said proudly. “He calls it a 
knickknack. Like to have me 
spend it here, I suppose.” 

The customer on Nick’s 
right spun the coin on the bar 
and watched fascinated as it 
flashed and sparkled. “The 
damn thing looks new,” he 
said. 

“Naw,” Ed said. “That’s 
just because Nick polishes it 
five times a day. That’s the 
only work he does.” 

The customer on Nick’s 
right spun the coin again. 
“Give you five for it.” 

Nick grabbed the credit. 
“Worth a lot more than that.” 

“Ten. It’s not worth more 
than ten.” 

“Worth more than that to 
me.” Nick returned the coin to 
his currency folder and leaned 
on the bar to leer at Ed. “Hear 
that, Fatso? Knickknack, you 
say. Broke, you say. You 
heard him offer me ten for 
it.” 

The customer on Nick’s 
right had his own currency 
folder out, counting carefully. 
“Twelve. I’ll give you twelve. 
Here — two Fission Fizzes 
here.” He pushed one at Nick. 
“Shanks is my name, Fernell.

What do you say to twelve?” 
On Nick’s left, the gangling 
Hullman suddenly slumped 
over the bar. “Twelve credits. 
I buy him drinks and he’s got 
more money than I have.” 
“No,” Nick gurgled, as he 
downed the drink. 

“What d’ya mean, no? You 
drink my liquor and you won’t 
do business?” 

“Two tenths,” the bartender 
said. 

“Here’s one, for my drink,” 
Shanks said. “Collect the other 
one from him.” 

“Just a minute, you,” Ed 
bellowed. “You ordered them 
drinks. You maybe want the 
bar mopped off with you?” 

“I pay for what I drink. One 
drink, one T.” 

E D’S beefy hands snaked 
across the bar and snatch- 
ed at Shanks’ throat. Shanks 
ducked away, but the bouncer 
came lumbering out of the 
shadows, and two bartenders 
were coming around the ends 
of the bar. Nick watched in- 
terestedly. 

Hullman said brokely, “You 
stand me one. That’s only fair. 
I stand you one and you stand 
me one. You got twelve cred- 
its.” 

“I ain’t got twelve credits,” 
Nick protested. 

Finding himself outnumber- 
ed, Shanks took out a T ticket, 
ripped it in two, and scorn- 
fully flung the pieces on the 
bar. “I’ll be waiting for you 
outside,” he growled at Nick.

Nick shuddered and pressed 
closer to the bar. The Fission 
Fizz had made him lose his 
head, and he figured his 
chances had dropped to a hun- 
dred to one. “Ed,” he said, 
“want to see you alone.” 

“You finished your drink?” 
Ed demanded. 

“Sure. Bui>-” 

“Jet. Your business ain’t 
welcome here. We like paying 
customers.” 

“Please, Ed. Just for a min- 
ute.” 

“It don’t take no minute. 
Whatever it is, the answer’s 
no !” 

Ed carefully made his way 
back to the other end of the 
bar. The bartender looked 
sympathetically at Nick and 
shook his head. “You aren’t a 
bad guy, Nick. Why don’t you 
get a job and settle down? 
You’re getting a little old for 
bumming around and dodging 
the police ...” 

Nick started. “Police? I 
ain’t never done nothin’ 
wrong.” 

“Your wife’s got the police 
looking for you. They were in 
here yesterday, asking ques- 
tions. Something about non- 
support. Why don’t you get a 
job and live right?” 

“You ever see my wife?” 
“Once a long time ago. She 
came in nere looking for you.” 
“You think I should work 
and let her grab the money? 
You know how they do — she 
makes a complaint and I don’t 
get as much as one T. I’m just 



as well off this way. I ain’t got 
nothin’, but I ain’t givin’ her 
nothin’ either.” 

“Yeah. I see what you 
mean.” 

Ed came around the bar and 
gripped Nick by the ear. 
“Out!” he commanded. 

“Please, Ed. Just lemme 
talk to you a minute.” 

“No!” 

“Please, Ed.” 

Ed glared and finally jerked 
his thumb at the vacant end 
of the bar. 

N ICK slunk along the bar, 
matching Ed’s slow prog- 
ress, and watching him anx- 
iously. 

“Give,” Ed ordered. He 
scornfully refused to incline 
his head toward Nick, so Nick 
hunched himself up on the bar. 

“I got a tip on the second at 
Asteroid Way.” 

Ed guffawed. “When did 
you ever pick a winner?” 
“Aw, Ed. It’s a good tip. 
It’ll pay fifty to one. I could 
pay you off.” 

“You got one credit. Go 
ahead and make your bet.” 
“Ed, listen. Some scientist 
— he’s made some dope to put 
in the fuel. This tank could 
win with its jets plugged. The 
others won’t get close enough 
to scorch their noses. Fifty to 
one, and it’s sure.” 

“Sure to be disqualified. 
They always test the fuel.” 
“Their test ain’t no good on 
this stuff.” 

“Who gave you the tip?” 



AN HONEST CREDIT 



87 




“I'd tell you, Ed, but I 
promised ...” 

“I ain’t buying no Moon 
atmosphere. Who told you?” 

“I can’t,” Nick whined. He 
waited a moment, anxiously 
watching Ed’s unyielding 
face. “Rocket Amutz,” he 
whispered. 

Ed was suddenly thought- 
ful. “The Rocket usually 
knows,” he admitted. 

“It’s fifty to one, Ed !” 
“What’s the tank?” 

“Up an ’ Atom. In the sec- 
ond.” 

“When’d you see the Rock- 
et?” 

“This momin’.” 

Ed glanced at the clock. 
“You sure took your time tell- 
ing me about it.” 

“I was broke, Ed. I had a 
hard time gettin’ down here. 
I hadda hitch a ride with a 
delivery flyer.” 

“Then you hadda mooch a 
couple of drinks to get up the 
nerve to put the tag on me,” 
Ed snapped. He tapped 
thoughtfully on the bar. “All 
right, I’ll call it in. Ten for me 
and five for you. Only it all 
goes in my name, and I’m de- 
ducting what you owe before 
I pay you.” 

“Couldn’t you just — ” 

“All right. Three Fizzes on 
the house. That’s for the tip. 
The five goes on your account, 
and it better come right off.” 

E D LEFT to place the bet, 
and Nick leaned content- 
edly on the bar and contem- 



plated his three Fizzes. Hull- 
man came staggering toward 
him and leaned out to squint 
hungrily at the drinks. Nick’s 
arm encircled them protect- 
ingly. 

“He’s gonna buy it all,” 
Hullman croaked. “He’s got 
twelve credits and he’s gonna 
buy it all. I stood him one, and 
now I’m broke and he won’t 
stand me one, and he’s got 
twelve credits.” He took a wild 
swing at Nick, who ducked, 
still protecting the drinks. 
The bouncer latched onto Hull- 
man and dragged him away. 

Ed returned and switched 
on the visiscope. Nick sipped 
delicately on the first Fizz and 
gloated over the other two. 
The huge screen flickered to 
'life. Asteroid Way. The start- 
ing line. First race. 

Jets flamed as the ships got 
under way. Nick watched 
them absently. The drink 
warmed and cheered him, and 
the identification stripes were 
beginning to blur slightly. The 
scene changed to the first Way 
Station. The ships were points 
of light in the distance, loom- 
ing suddenly large and flash- 
ing past. The announcer bark- 
ed out the placings. The 
flaming points of the jets di- 
minished and merged into sin- 
gle bright dots that seemed 
to hang motionless against the 
backdrop of space. 

Nick set down an empty 
glass and rubbed his eyes. The 
scene changed to the second 
Way Station.

“Wasn’t that Altairian Miss 
in the lead?” asked a voice at 
Nick’s elbow. 

Nick shrugged, happily in- 
different. “Not my race,” he 
said. He reached for the sec- 
ond glass and kept his eyes on 
the screen. He sipped slowly 
and finished it just as the race 
was ending. 

A voice droned out the win- 
ners and the scene shifted to 
preparations for the second 
race. Bustling spacetugs were 
towing the ships into position. 
Harried spacesuited workers 
were putting the finishing 
touches on the identification 
marks — shaping the white 
magnetic particles into the 
network of stripes that iden- 
tified the ship’s position at the 
starting line. Nick gripped his 
third glass firmly, but he did 
not raise it. He kept his eyes 
on number six — three short 
longitudinal stripes — Up an’ 
Atom. 

The announcer read off the 
preliminaries in a monotonous 
singsong. The ships, the pilots, 
the odds. The ships, the pilots, 
the odds. The ships . 

«>T»HEY’RE stallin’,” Nick 

A croaked. 

“Waiting for the reports on 
the fuel tests,” Ed said gloomi- 
ly. 

The screen flashed as the 
electronic starting switch fired 
all jets simultaneously. Nick’s 
hand tightened on the glass. 
He clung paralyzed to the bar 
and slowly closed his eyes. 



First Way Station: Up an’ 
Atom second. 

Second Way Station : Up 
an’ Atom first. 

Nick’s trembling hand set 
the Fizz sloshing wildly in the 
glass. 

Third Way Station : Up an’ 
Atom second. 

“Got a chance,” Ed admit- 
ted in a low, almost incredu- 
lous voice. 

Fourth Way Station: Up 
an’ Atom second. 

Fifth Way Station: Up an’ 
Atom first. 

Nick half raised his drink 
and set it down again. 

Sixth Way Station: the 
halfway mark, Up an’ Atom 
first. 

“Got a chance,” Ed admit- 
ted again. 

Nick dared to open his eyes. 
Seventh Way Station: Up an’ 
Atom first. The twelve ships 
were strung out along the 
course now, half of them hope- 
lessly behind. Eighth Way 
Station : Up an’ Atom second. 
Nick closed his eyes again and 
kept them closed while Up an’ 
Atom was third at the ninth 
Way Station, and second at 
the tenth. 

The eleventh Way Station: 
Up an’ Atom first. Nick open- 
ed his eyes and stared hyp- 
notically at the screen. The 
finish line. 

Suddenly Nick jerked the 
glass to his lips, drained it, 
and slammed it down. He 
whirled and raced wildly for 
the door. A bottle whizzed

past his ear, struck the side 
of the door, and caromed out 
into the street with a mon- 
strous dent in its plastic side. 
Nick paused only to verify its 
emptiness. 

Up an ’ Atom had finished 
fifth. 

Nick charged on down the 
street, and ran headlong into 
a sturdy pair of arms. It was 
Shanks. 

“Thought I wouldn’t wait, 
didn’t you?” Shanks menac- 
ingly snarled. 

Nick barely had time to 
blink before a fist smashed 
into his face, and knocked him 
down and out. 

H E AWOKE in a dim room 
and lay motionless, star- 
ing at the ceiling. The splotch- 
es of dampness, the sprawling 
network of cracks looked fa- 
miliar, and yet unfamiliar. He 
roused himself weakly and 
looked about him. It was his 
wife’s apartment. 

Suddenly she appeared in 
the doorway, and he stared 
fearfully at her bloated and 
bleary image. The bleariness, 
Nick knew, was his own do- 
ing. The bloat was the exclu- 
sive property of his wife. 

She eyed him hostilely for a 
moment and called over her 
shoulder, “He’s awake.” 

She was joined in the door- 
way by a grotesquely thin, 
spinsterish-looking female and 
a pair of husky males. 

“Fightin’s new with him,” 
Nick’s wife said. “He never 

90 



got in a fight before. He’s too 
much of a coward.” 

“There, there, you poor 
dear,” the thin woman said, 
patting her shoulder tenderly. 
“Don’t you worry about a 
thing. Everything will be all 
right.” 

“It’s been hard,” his wife 
sniffed. “Twenty-two years we 
been married, and twelve 
young ones, and he’s never had 
a job the whole time.” 

“You should have reported 
him years ago. But don’t you 
worry. We’ll take care of 
things.” She advanced to the 
bed and stood looking grimly 
down at Nick. “So you’re 
Nicholas Femell. I won’t say 
I’m happy to meet you, Slip- 
pery Nick, but I have a job to 
do. I’m Officer Holmes of the 
Family Welfare Bureau. Do 
you know what that means?” 

Nick looked up at the sharp 
protrusion of her nose and 
covered his face with his 
hands. “Go away,” he moaned. 

“On your wife’s complaint, 
Nicholas Femell, we’ve been 
investigating you. Your record 
isn’t a pretty one. Married 
twenty-two years, father of 
twelve children, and you’ve 
never earned an honest credit 
in your life.” 

“That’s a lie!” Nick shout- 
ed. 

“Oh, sure!” his wife shriek- 
ed. “A lie, he says! Twenty- 
one years ago he helped some 
bartender unload a beer flyer, 
and he got paid one credit. 
He’s been savin’ it ever since, 



KIRBY KERR 




and I guarantee he never earn- 
ed another one.” 

“We’ll soon change that,” 
Officer Holmes said cheerfully. 
“This is a court summons, Mr. 
Fernell. A judge is going to 
take one look at your record 
and send you to prison, where 
all lazy men belong. Unless, 
that is, we can tell him you’ve 
corrected your shiftless ways 
and gone to work. Which will 
it be — work or prison?” 

Nick stared at the paper. 
“Go away,” he moaned. “I’m 
sick.” 

Officer Holmes sniffed re- 
provingly. “It’s that terrible 
poison you drink. Two years 
in space will straighten you 
out nicely.” 

T HE word space echoed and 
re-echoed down long corri- 
dors in Nick’s alcohol-fogged 
mind. He tumbled from the 
bed and scurried toward the 
door, flinging himself franti- 
cally at the narrow gap that 
separated Officer Holmes’ 
sturdy deputies. The gap slam- 
med shut on him. He was 
propelled back into the bed- 
room, where he slumped onto 
the floor and wailed, “I’m 
sick.” 

“Poor man,” Officer Holmes 
said, with sneering sweetness. 
“Hasn’t done any work for so 
long that the thought of it 
makes him sick. Come, come, 
man.” Her pointed shoes prod- 
ded painfully at his ribs. 
“Here are your work papers. 
Sign them and the boys will 



take you to the spaceport and 
put you aboard. Or don’t sign 
them and they’ll take you to 
prison. Two years in space 
or five years in the Lunar 
Penitentiary — which will it 
be?” 

Face a sickly green, teeth 
chattering, fingers trembling 
so that Officer Holmes had to 
hand him the pen three times, 
Nick signed. 

Officer Holmes purred with 
satisfaction. “The Vegan Line 
is a good place to work. We 
find only the best jobs for our 
problem cases. And you’ll have 
nothing to worry about here at 
home. The company will send 
your lovely family your wages 
every month.” 

Fright had startled Nick 
into a general condition of so- 
briety. The smug expression 
on his wife’s face enraged 
him. 

“My family !” he shouted. “I 
got no family. Try an’ find a 
kid that looks like me. Not one 
of ’em’s mine!” 

Officer Holmes said severe- 
ly, “It won’t help you to insult 
your wife.” 

“How could I insult a bag 
like that? Slipped somethin’ 
in my drink, she did, an’ I 
woke up married to her. I was 
an honest, hard-workin’, law- 
abidin’ man, an’ look what she 
done to me. She got me fired 
by hangin’ around tryin’ to 
get advances on my pay. 
Every job I got, she got me 
fired, or she snatched the mon- 
ey for herself. Why wouldn’t 



AN HONEST CREDIT

I be drove to drink? Just look 
at her. She was just as ugly 
twenty-two years ago, except 
she wasn’t so fat. An’ the kids 
— I ain’t never slept with her 
in my life, unless it was the 
night we was married, an’ I 
don’t remember nothin’ about 
that. I don’t sleep with her, an’ 
I don’t know what man in his 
right mind would touch her, 
but she keeps havin’ ’em. An’ 
I’ll tell you one thing — papers 
or no papers, space or no 
space, I ain’t workin’ to sup- 
port her and her kids !” 

Officer Holmes flew at him, 
face white, her mouth a grim- 
ly etched line. “You wicked, 
no-good man! Kiss your wife 
good-by now. Kiss her!” 
“Lemme out of here!” Nick 
yelled. 

The deputies got him out. 
They escorted him down the 
stairway, and the sobs of 
Nick’s wife floated after them, 
along with Officer Holmes’ 
purring consolation. 

“You got my sympathy, fel- 
low,” one of the men said. 
“But we got a job to do.” 
“That’s okay,” Nick told 
him. “I’ll get out of it.” 
“There’s no getting out of 
it, fellow. Space is no place to 
jump ship, and you won’t get 
a chance in port.” 

“I’ll get out of it,” Nick 
said grimly, “if it has to be 
space.” 

At the spaceport Nick was 
rushed through a medical ex- 
amination, booted aboard an 
ugly looking freighter, and 

92 



locked in a tiny cabin. The 
door was locked. Nick chuckled 
quietly to himself, and as soon 
as things appeared to be quiet, 
he removed a plastic safety 
pin from his shirt and went to 
work on the plastic lock. 

F IFTEEN minutes later it 
gave a satisfying click. 
Nick cautiously swung open 
the door. The corridor was de- 
serted. Voices drifted back to 
him from the control room. In 
the cabin next to his he heard 
a man — probably another 
“caser” like himself — sobbing 
brokenly. Nick tiptoed care- 
fully along the corridor and 
found his way to the airlock. 
The airlock stood open. 

He stood for a moment, sur- 
veying the field. Ships stood at 
arithmetically concise inter- 
vals. The terminal buildings 
rose on the far side of the 
field, distant and impersonal. 
Nick could see no guards, no 
human movement. He scram- 
bled down the ladder and 
dashed to the cover of the next 
ship. 

The edge of the field was a 
hundred yards away. Then 
there was only a low board 
fence, and beyond that a 
scraggly growth of stunted 
trees, wild underbrush, and — 
freedom. 

“I’ll go west,” Nick told 
himself. “I never shoulda stay- 
ed around the east coast. I’ll 
go west, an’ maybe I can make 
a clean start.” 

He crouched down and 

KIRBY KERR 




tensed himself for the last 
dash. 

A S SOON as he broke into 
the open, the sentry saw 
him. “Caser,” he muttered dis- 
gustedly. “Someone forgot to 
lock him in. Well, I’ll wait till 
he gets to the fence. He proba- 
bly needs the exercise. And 
boy, oh, boy, has he got a 
shock coming!” 

He dropped to one knee and 
sighted along a short, oddly 
bulging barrel. The panting 
figure was ten feet from the 
fence when he pulled the trig- 
ger and it spun wildly, stag- 
gered backward, and toppled 
to the ground with arms and 
legs churning in agony. The 
wide-eyed sentry barked a few 
words into his communicator 
and ran forward. A second 
sentry hurried to meet him, 
and they stood looking incred- 
ulously at the still twitching 
body. 

“I just gave him one shot,” 
the first sentry said, “but it 
didn’t paralyze him. What 
happened?” 

The second sentry bent 
down and ripped open Nick’s 
shirt. He caught his breath 
and straightened up, a sickly 
pallor on his face. “I’ll be 
damned. Metal. He had metal 
there, inside his shirt. It fo- 
cused the beam and burned a 
hole in his chest.” 

The first sentry slumped to 
the ground and buried his face 
in his hands. 

“Not your fault,” the sec- 



ond sentry said. “Snap out of 
it now. Who would have 
thought one of these damned 
casers would have metal on 
him? Nobody has metal any 
more. You call an ambu- 
lance?” 

“Sure. Right away. Do you 
suppose — ?” 

“Doubt it. He’s alive, but 
not for long. Did you see that 
hole? The metal was right 
against his chest. Wonder 
what it was.” He bent over 
Nick and came up with a 
smudged piece of metal. 

The first sentry stared at it. 
“A metal credit. Ever see one 
before?” 

“I never did,” the second 
sentry said. 

“We better save it for the 
poor guy’s family. These cas- 
ers always have big families. 
Wonder how long he’s carried 
the thing around. He’s been 
rich without knowing it. My 
brother works for a big shot 
that collects these things. Any 
coin at all brings ten thousand 
credits, and some of the rare 
dates bring as high as fifty 
thousand. I’ll have my brother 
get an estimate on this one. 
The guy’s family could proba- 
bly use the money.” 

Nick’s eyes were open, 
staring. His lips moved feebly. 

“What’d he say?” the first 
sentry said. “Ask him where 
he got this thing.” 

The second sentry bent 
over, and straightened up dis- 
gustedly. “He says he earned 
it.” 



AN HONEST CREDIT

“That's a laugh. Wonder 
what's keeping the ambulance. 
Fellow, we're sorry about this. 
You ought to know better than 
to carry metal around. If you'd 
been working anywhere near a 
factory, it would have killed 
you long ago. We'll see that 
your family gets the coin. It's 
worth a lot of money." 

Nick's lips moved again, 
and the second sentry bent 
over him. 

“He wants it back," he said. 
“He says it's his and he wants 
it back. If he dies, he wants 
it buried with him." 

The first sentry shrugged 
and tucked the coin into 
Nick's pocket. “That's the way 
these casers are — they never 
give a damn about their fam- 
ilies. If he dies, though, the 
family will get that coin. He 
won't have a thing to say 
about it." 

W HITE-FACED, biting his 
lips to fight the searing 
agony, Nick summoned his 
fading strength. “Too good 
for my family," he whispered. 
“They don't deserve it. I want 
it buried with me." 

The ambulance swooped 
down, and a corpulent doctor 
lumbered over to Nick, took 
one look at his chest, and ex- 



pertly stabbed a hypodermic 
needle into his arm. 

“I suppose he's done for," 
the first sentry said, as the 
doctor went to work on the 
chest. 

“Well, now," the doctor 
said. “I wouldn't exactly call 
him in good shape, but he'll 
live. He'll be some time heal- 
ing up, though. And that 
damned Family Welfare Bu- 
reau will never get him into 
space — not with what he'll 
have left for a lung. Easy does 
it, man. You won't feel a thing 
in a moment. There. Now it's 
off to the hospital for a long 
rest." 

Stretcher - bearers eased 
Nick onto a stretcher and 
started for the ambulance. 
The first sentry hurried after 
them. “Say, fellow — if you 
want, I'll get word to my 
brother's boss about that coin 
you got. He'll give you at least 
ten thousand for it — maybe 
more. What do you say ?" 

He stopped abruptly and 
came stomping back. 

“What'd he say?" the sec- 
ond sentry said. 

“Said he won't part with it. 
Said it's his lucky credit." He 
spat. “The thing half killed 
him and he calls it lucky!"

Worlds of if 

Book Reviews by Frederik Pohl 



W HAT makes a science fic- 
tion story? Must it be 
packed with gadgets and in- 
ventions? Or is a science 
fiction story better told with- 
out them? 

There are a number of 
persons who enjoy science 
fiction but are repelled by 
such gadgets as we find in 
most science fiction magazine 
stories. These people don’t 
care much for science; they 
don’t read scientific articles, 
even the ones in science fic- 
tion magazines. What they 
are interested in is people, in 
what men and women think 
and feel. The science in sci- 
ence fiction stories, the crack- 
ing suns and the alien 
invaders, are to them only 
additional strains that can be 
applied to the human organ- 
ism, not essentially different 
from an adulterous wife or an 
unrequited love. It is the 
effect of scientific incident, 
not the incident itself, that 
these readers enjoy. 

Just as numerous, and ap- 
pearing in unexpected places, 
are those who say that no 
science fiction story should 
dare show itself in print 



without at least one pat- 
entable invention. Harper’s 
Magazine is one such place. 
Its peripatetic reviewer me- 
thodically chewed one science 
fiction anthology apart a 
while ago, complaining in 
solemn ignorance that, as 
none of the stories contained 
a new ray gun or an improv- 
ed rocket ship, they were 
scarcely science fiction at all. 

Well, that’s nonsense on 
the face of it. Gadgets are not 
science. Yet there is no doubt 
that gadgets spring up where 
science has passed, as meadow 
flowers mark the paths of 
long-gone cattle. Certainly 
advances in science produce 
gadgets. Newton’s Opticks 
begat the Schmidt telescope. 
Einstein was the ancestor of 
the Nautilus. But what is the 
answer? Can good science fic- 
tion be written with few 
gadgets or none at all? Con- 
versely, can stories that re- 
ly heavily on gadgetry be 
“good”? 

H ALF a dozen new books 
offer us insights into this 
question. Three have gadgets. 
Three don’t. All six happen 



95 




to be particularly good books, 
which is a help. 

March Cost’s The Bespoken 
Mile (Vanguard) is so gad- 
get-free as hardly to be 
science fiction. (Surely Miss 
Cost had no such intention 
for it!) Aubrey Menen in 
The Fig Tree (Scribners) 
and John Wyndham in The 
Midivich Cuckoos (Ballan- 
tine) offer clearer cases, but 
each has only one “great lie” 
to set them apart from non-sf 
writing; neither book multi- 
plies invention past that 
point. 

These are the sort of sci- 
ence fiction books that can be 
given to those relatives and 
neighbors who won’t read 
science fiction. They’ll read 
these — that is, if they read, 
they will read these. The cas- 
ual reader might finish any 
one of these without quite 
knowing that they were sci- 
ence fiction at all. 

But they are, surely. Miss 
Cost’s story is of precognition. 
A young dancer, Summer Day 
— yes, that’s her name ; a 
stage name, but the one she 
lives under — inherits a home 
in Scotland. She gives up the 
music halls, settles down in 
the Highlands, falls in love 
and marries. As she becomes 
a bride she sees ahead to the 
death of her husband at the 
Battle of Cassino. She be- 
comes aware that the end of 
happiness is sorrow; and, 
having learned this, goes on. 

John Wyndham’s story is 



brighter and slighter. In the 
town of Midwich, where 
nothing has happened in cen- 
turies, the entire town falls 
impenetrably asleep. Every- 
one~*entering it topples over 
like the rest. When the town 
awakes, it is to discover that 
every woman of childbearing 
age has become pregnant. 
The children in time are 
born; they have golden eyes 
and are telepathic; they are 
cuckoos — changelings in an- 
other bird’s nest — begotten by 
mysterious aliens, and there- 
fore alien themselves in spite 
of their human mothers. 

Aubrey Menen’s fig tree is 
an invention — a true gadget 
— deliberately developed by 
one Harry Wesley. As a boy, 
Harry determines that he will 
live to see a statue raised in 
his honor. How can he do 
this? Why, by solving one of 
mankind’s great needs. He 
casts about for a suitable 
need and finds it in overpopu- 
lation, in the Malthusian race 
between birth rate and food 
supply. His first idea is there- 
fore to invent an oral con- 
traceptive, but a patient 
schoolmaster talks him out of 
that: “My dear Mr. Wesley, 
I am given to understand that 
already there is available a 
wide range of contraceptives. 
They must all have been in- 
vented by somebody — clever 
fellows, too, when you come 
to think of it. But I don’t re- 
call any of them ever getting 
a statue.” Harry sees the 



96 




logic of the position. He 
thanks the instructor and se- 
lects another project: to in- 
vent something which will 
double the world’s food sup- 
ply. What he invents is a 
super-fertilizer which he ap- 
plies to a fig tree, making it 
The Fig Tree. 

T HE above is what these 
books are about. 

It would be witless malice 
to pretend that these skeletal 
thematic sketches convey any 
idea of what the books are. 
The outline of The Bespoken 
Mile shows nothing of March 
Cost’s delicate sense of the 
interplay of personalities, of 
her three-dimensional Scot- 
tish landscape or of her com- 
passion for the unripe but 
doggedly maturing Summer 
Day. In describing the plot of 
The Fig Tree there is no 
place to tell of Uncle George, 
the great manufacturer who 
makes “the bit of a guided 
missile that always goes 
wrong” or to recount the 
morose conversation on classic 
literature that takes place in 
the Greek ruins at Paestum, 
or to repeat Menen’s observa- 
tions of the ins and outs of 
Vatican life. The plot of The 
Midivich Cuckoos can tell us 
what the alien children are 
like, but it takes all of Wynd- 
ham’s book to show us what 
it is like to be a human adult 
entrusted with raising them. 

It is the development of 
these books that makes them 



of interest. But that develop- 
ment is not in science fiction 
terms. Once the “one great 
lie” is told in each case — the 
single thing that isn’t so — 
there are no subsidiary in- 
ventions; there are, in other 
words, no gadgets. 

And these are three first- 
rate books. They make ex- 
cellent exhibits for the 
anti-gadget argument. 

But turn to the next three 
books and we see the other 
side of the coin. 

Clifford D. Simak’s Ring 
Around the Sun is now re- 
printed by Ace, and we also 
have C. M. Kornbluth’s two 
posthumous short story col- 
lections, A Mile Beyond the 
Moon (Doubleday) and The 
Marching Morons (Ballan- 
tine) . 

Gadgets? These books are 
full of gadgets — both in the 
strict sense of gleaming little 
artifacts that do things and 
in the larger sense of any 
sort of scientific or technolog- 
ical thing or event that is not 
normally a part of our lives. 
Simak’s story gives us a fresh 
gadget on every page. We 
have a razor blade that never 
wears out, a light bulb that 
burns forever, a cigarette 
lighter that needs no fuel. We 
have a car that is constructed 
to be passed on from father 
to son, down the genera- 
tions. 

We have a child’s toy that 
spins and transports the view- 
er into another dimension. 



97 




We have a secret society of 
mutants, and another secret 
society devoted to hunting 
mutants down. We have 
mechanical spy-mice, robots, 
androids, telepaths, super- 
homes, super-garments — 
everything but a super-kitch- 
en sink, though on page 31 
we find a super-toaster, a 
super-refrigerator and a su- 
per-washing machine. 

W E ALSO have a fine story, 
even a brilliant story, in 
which every last one of these 
gadgets plays an essential 
part. For Simak does not 
throw gadgets at the reader 
in order to distract him, to 
keep him from noticing that 
there isn’t any story ; his 
gadgets make the story. The 
number of Simak’s gadgets is 
countless, but it is exactly the 
number he needs to tell his 
story, each one placed where 
it must be to make the point 
he wants made. 

What emerges is a tight, 
warm, human, credible story. 
And that is what Simak in- 
tended all along. 

Kornbluth practiced the 
same art. In the two new vol- 
umes of his short stories 
there are twenty-four sep- 
arate pieces. Each story is an 
invention. Each contains 
many subsidiary inventions: 
an armorarium of surgical 
instruments in The Little 
Black Bag, a self-sustaining 
maritime economy in Shark 
Ship, a recipe for maintaining 

98 



society on a permanent war- 
time footing in The Luckiest 
Man in Denv. 

What is most notable about 
a Kornbluth story is that his 
characters are always per- 
fectly at ease in their sur- 
roundings. In Two Dooms his 
time-traveler makes a life for 
himself in the frightening 
world that the victorious Axis 
created after World War II. 
The described world cannot 
be — now or ever; but Korn- 
bluth so constructs it, so 
provides it with tradition, 
folkways, sex habits, super- 
stitions, vehicles, homes, 
farms — with all the parts of a 
world — that it springs up into 
perspective. 

Kornbluth and Simak do 
not bring their scientific inci- 
dent to us; they take us to 
other worlds entirely. They 
create these worlds for us, 
building them out of such 
furniture as does not exist 
here and now at all. Those are 
the rules of the game. It is 
only what does not exist that 
a Kornbluth or a Simak will 
trouble to tell us about. 

The kind of story that takes 
us away from here and now 
makes more demands on the 
writer than the sort that 
starts with its society already 
mapped out. Unfortunately 
for its popularity, it makes 
more demands on the reader 
too. For that reason the kind 
of science fiction we see in 
the big slick magazines or the 
major book clubs is likely to 




be the simple, gadget-free 
type. 

Well, there’s nothing wrong 
with that. If the man across 
the street won’t trouble to 
follow what Simak or Korn- 
bluth are talking about, so 
much the worse for him. He 
will enjoy The Fig Tree, The 
Bespoken Mile and The Mid- 
ivich Cuckoos all the same. 

So will we; but we can go 
farther. Science fiction has 
resources beyond these. Sci- 
ence fiction can go anywhere 
and do anything — so long as 
the journey is planned with 
intelligence and illuminated 
with thought — and it is the 
likes of Simak and Kornbluth 
who can exploit its potential 
at its farthest reach. 

U P TILL now we have been 
talking about good books. 
Unfortunately not all books 
are good — whether science 
fiction or anything else. Per- 
haps we can see what it is 
that the gadget-haters so dis- 
like by examining a few books 
that earn lower marks. 

Avalon has elected to bring 
back to life Manly Wade 
Wellman’s twenty-year-old 
magazine novel, Giants from 
Eternity. This story was pre- 
posterous in 1939 ; age has not 
helped it. It begins with a 
mysterious meteorite (or 
something) that falls on a 
farm and begins to eat every- 
thing in sight, turning what 
it eats scarlet and threatening 
to engorge the world. A cou- 



ple of poisonously juvenile 
scientists investigate it. They 
are baffled and helpless, but 
they manage to extract a sort 
of resurrection-juice from it, 
which they use to bring back 
the greatest minds of all time 
to help them out. These are 
the “Giants from Eternity’’ 
and they include Thomas Edi- 
son, Isaac Newton, Louis 
Pasteur, Charles Darwin and 
Madame Curie. One of the ju- 
veniles is entrapped by the 
red stuff and thus works to 
help it spread; the revived 
Giants take a few days to 
master everything that has 
happened in science since 
their deaths, then quickly in- 
vent everything necessary to 
wipe out the red menace and 
bring about a happy ending. 

It happens that when Marie 
Curie died she was sixty-sev- 
en years old and paid very 
little attention to her personal 
appearance. As this fact did 
not suit the author, he chose 
to write it away. When Marie 
Curie is revived she is “a slen- 
der young woman, blonde and 
pale and lovely.” Artistic li- 
cense? All right. Artistic li- 
cense should be extended only 
to art. Giants from Eternity 
is nothing like art. It is fast- 
moving; but it is also crude. 

In The Involuntary Immor- 
tals (Avalon), Rog Phillips 
tells us about a woman named 
Helen Hanover. She is as 
blonde and lovely as Well- 
man’s Madame Curie, but 
somewhat older — she is a 



99 




hundred and forty-one and 
her third husband has just 
died of old age. She is immor- 
tal. Mourning because every- 
one she knows dies around 
her, despondent because she is 
unique in the world, she hops 
a train and sits down beside 
— guess ? Why, beside another 
immortal. 

It’s a small world, but not 
that small. Nor is that the end 
of this book’s fantastic impo- 
sitions on the credulity of its 
readers. We are asked to be- 
lieve that there are hundreds 
of these immortals and that 
they maintain laboratories 
and colonies without their 
existence even being suspect- 
ed by the government or the 
public — although for some 
peculiar reason every priest 
and nun of the Catholic 
Church knows all about them. 
We are told that the villain of 
the piece is Helen Hanover’s 
long-lost little boy! 

It would have taken only 
the smallest amount of 
thought and trouble for the 
author to remove some of the 
worst implausibilities of The 
Involuntary Immortals, but it 
was more effort than he was 
willing to make. 

In The Plot Against Earth 
(Ace), Calvin M. Knox 
has “hypno jewel” smugglers 
threatening the Earth. His 
hero is a narcotics agent who 
zips from planet to planet, is 
cast away when his interstel- 
lar liner is bombed, survives 
enormous hardship but ulti- 

100 



mately stamps out the ring. 
Earth is saved. It has all been 
very wearing for Knox’s 
hero, but not for the reader, 
who, after fanning througli 
138 pages, has learned noth- 
ing more than he knew be- 
fore, experienced no new emo- 
tions, been compelled to do no 
thinking whatsoever. It is all 
quite painless for the reader 
and all quite pointless too. 

In Recruit for Andromeda 
(Ace), Milton Lesser follows 
a group of draftees on the 
“Nowhere Journey.” They 
have been snatched from 
Earth and transported to the 
planet of a far star for the 
purpose of — well, let’s see, re- 
flects the author; this time 
let’s make it a universe-wide 
contest to see which race is 
smartest, ablest, strongest. 

Our hero is matched against 
a female specimen of that ut- 
terly alien race, the Russians. 
He wins. 

W HATEVER thought has 
gone into these books 
was on the run. It is impos- 
sible to believe that any page 
of any one of them could ever 
represent anything true or 
real. They are packed with 
gadgets, invented on the fly 
for purely cosmetic purposes ; 
opium isn’t “science-fictiony” 
enough so the writer snaps 
his fingers twice and comes up 
with a word: “hypnojewels.” 
The typing proceeds. He has 
to destroy a ship — a bomb — 
but that’s not “seience-fic- 




tiony” either. Snap, snap. An 
“implosion” bomb, then! This 
is in The Plot Against Earth , 
but the same thing happens 
in The Involuntary Immor- 
tals. 

What’s an implosion bomb? 
A light bulb is an implosion 
bomb — that is, if you break 
it, it will implode. Could it 
destroy a ship or a building? 
Probably — if they were in- 
side it. Recruit for Andro- 
meda has a “gadget” that 
makes mere implosion bombs 
look almost sane. A bunch of 
ships are lighting in the space 
between galaxies. Our hero 
can’t observe them directly, 
but that’s all right — one of 
them is on fire, and he can 
keep track of the others by 
watching their shadows. The 
shadows are cast on the An- 
dromeda Nebula! 

T HERE’S nothing wrong 
with an hour’s nirvana, of 
course. Poul Anderson’s The 
War of Two Worlds ( Ace) is 
light enough and fast enough 
for any adventure fan ; it asks 
little of him, but it pays for 
its time with skillful plot car- 
pentry to conceal the loose 
ends ; it has its share of 
gadgets and gimmicks, but 
they are put where they serve 
a purpose and they give at 
least the temporary illusion 
that they might work. Ander- 
son’s Earth has just lost a 
war with Mars and is occu- 
pied. An Earthman seeks to 
liberate his planet and does 



so — in a way that is both 
satisfying and unexpected. So 
with John Brunner’s Thresh- 
old of Eternity (Ace), where 
a man from here and now is 
kidnaped into a great future 
war that swirls back and 
forth through space and time. 
Edmond Hamilton does a 
competent, professional job 
in The Star of Life (Dodd, 
Mead) ; his hero was fired 
into orbit, and froze there for 
thousands of years, coming 
back to life to find himself in 
a struggle among much-mu- 
tated races of humanity. Peter 
Bryant’s Red Alert (Ace) is 
a first-rate action story about 
an American Air Force gen- 
eral who, believing in preven- 
tive war, elects to start World 
War III singlehanded. 

Peter Bryant’s story isn’t 
“gadgety” in our present 
sense, but the novels by Ham- 
ilton, Brunner and Anderson 
are — gadget enough and ad- 
venturous enough for anyone. 
"It’s unfair to try to guess at 
the motives or morals of an 
author — he exposes enough of 
himself in submitting his 
printed words to review. But 
it is tempting to imagine that 
all four of these books were 
once, in hasty, rough first 
draft, much like the previous 
four; and that then, with 
hard skillful work, the rough 
edges were smoothed, the im- 
plausibilities removed. 

It is that step that seems to 
have been omitted in the 
others. END

into Silence 



get to Xaron — so what was Alamo gambling 



to arrive alive? 



By WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 




T HE whistle sounded for the 
meal break, and the opera- 
tors switched off their ma- 
chines and began to stream 
toward the door. Marno took 
a long time cleaning his hands, 
watching the figure of Bellen, 
the inspector, at the far end 
of the machine shop, waiting 
for him to go into his office. 
As soon as he saw Bellen 
move, Marno picked up his 
satchel and strolled out of the 
door after the others. 

The air outside shook with 
the incessant roar of the ore- 
reducing plants, a tumult of 
sound that pounded on day 
and night, year after year. 
Marno didn't notice it, for it 
had thundered in his ears 
throughout his life. In front 
of him was the long bridgelike 
structure that supported the 
great conveyor belt, reaching 
straight out across the arid 



103 





slopes to the ragged line of red 
hills that stood out sharp and 
hard against the mauve sky. 
At one point, their skyline 
dipped in a V-shaped notch, 
the cutting that the conveyor 
belt passed through on its way 
to the Port. 

Marno's pulse hammered in 
his temples. Either he made 
his escape now or he would 
spend the rest of his life here 
in the Valley. The idea of es- 
cape had been in the back of 
his mind for a long time, and 
today, with Carn, the over- 
seer, away at a conference, 
Marno had an opportunity 
that mightn't come again. 

The last of the men ahead 
of him turned into the can- 
teen, but Marno walked 
straight on until he reached 
the end of the building. There 
was no one in sight. In front 
of him was the squat bulk of 
the powerhouse that drove the 
conveyor belt, with the ore- 
reducing installations tower- 
ing beyond it. Away to the 
right, the dry ground sloped 
upward, dotted with strag- 
gling clumps of purple scrub. 

Sweating, he began to run, 
past the open door of the 
powerhouse through which 
came the hum of vast nuclear 
motors. Above him, the giant 
conveyor belt rumbled out 
across innumerable rollers, 
an endless band that moved on 
for miles across a countryside 
unknown to him, for in the 
twenty-five years of his life 
Marno had never been beyond 



the fences that lined the Val- 
ley's rim. It was supposed to 
be unsafe to go beyond the 
wire fences. Most of the plan- 
et was alive with radioactiv- 
ity, or so they had been told. 

M ARNO crouched against 
one of the metal pylons 
supporting the belt, his knees 
trembling. There was still no- 
body within sight. Fifty feet 
above him, the belt roared 
endlessly on its way, carrying 
with it the whole of the indus- 
trial output of the Valley, 
dark bricks of a dense com- 
pound that could be made 
fiercely radioactive, supplying 
atomic power for a thousand 
and one industries in the civil- 
izations beyond. The speed of 
the belt was not too great for 
a man to jump aboard it. 

Steadily, as he had planned, 
he began to climb the girder- 
work. He was unaccustomed 
to heights, and he climbed 
without looking down. He 
climbed right to the top of the 
pylon, inching his way out 
over the moving belt. It moved 
much faster than he had 
thought, but nothing would 
have made him turn back now. 

His breath had a sound like 
a sob in it as he let himself 
drop, and then he was spin- 
ning over on the hard rubber- 
like surface. He lay flat on his 
back, feeling every second or 
so a sharp jar as the belt pass- 
ed over another set of rollers. 

There was no return now. 
As he was carried farther and 



104 



WYNNE N. WH1TEFORD 




farther away from the power- 
house, he felt a growing ela- 
tion. He was on his way to 
freedom. He had only the 
vaguest ideas of what he 
would find at the far end of 
the conveyor. He knew it was 
a place called the Port, where 
ships called to take cargoes of 
the astrium compound away 
to other places where it was 
used to generate power. 

He had never seen one of 
these ships close at hand, but 
he had often watched them 
take off in the night, sharp 
daggers of flame stabbing into 
the dark sky. He knew that 
they used rockets to lift them 
above the atmosphere, and he 
had heard talk about some- 
thing called an isolator that 
enabled them to make incon- 
ceivable journeys to the plan- 
ets of other suns. But his 
knowledge of these things was 
hazy. 

His own people never made 
such journeys. The spaceships 
were operated by men of the 
alien race that had controlled 
Marno’s world since before he 
had been born — men like 
Carn, the overseer. Marno had 
been told that they came from 
a place called Xaron, some- 
where in the planetary system 
of the great white star Altair. 
They were strange, alert men 
with unbounded energy. 

As the traveling belt climb- 
ed toward the cutting in the 
hills, he was able to look back 
over the whole of the Valley — 
the towering structures of the 

ESCAPE INTO SILENCE 



reducing plants, the colored 
aluminum houses, the beetle- 
like electric cars gleaming in 
the orange sunlight. Away to 
the right, the crushing bat- 
teries threw long plumes of 
dust into the air, and down by 
the lagoon a group of girls 
walked along the beach, limbs 
dark dresses bright. He could 
see the yellow house where he 
had lived until now with his 
married brother. This valley 
had been his world — the whole 
of it. 

S UDDENLY he found the 
walls of the cutting rising 
on either side of him, shutting 
the Valley from his view. He 
was tempted to spring off the 
moving belt while there was 
yet time, but even as he 
thought of it, he felt it tilt 
down over the hillcrest, and 
he knew it was too late. 

He had expected the cross- 
ing of the ridge to bring him 
within sight of the Port, but 
all he could see was a vast 
wilderness of seamed red hills 
and purple scrub, sloping 
down to a flat metallic sea that 
gleamed like bronze under the 
deep orange disc of the sun. 
A desert in which only the 
conveyor belt moved, snarling 
away to a horizon lost in heat 
haze. 

Marno was conscious of an 
appalling loneliness, a feeling 
that he had been a fool to 
think of leaving the Valley, 
where generation after gener- 
ation of his ancestors had 



105 




lived and worked and died. He 
thought of the comradeship of 
the machine shop, the gaiety 
of parties by the lagoon, the 
games he had played with his 
friends. The fear of the un- 
known grew in him with each 
mile the moving belt carried 
him onward. 

The sun dropped slowly 
over a sea that glared like 
molten iron as he neared and 
passed another ridge of wind- 
scored hills. Once he saw in 
the distance the corroded 
wreckage of gigantic machin- 
ery, but apart from that there 
was only rock and sand and 
scrub, and the miles after end- 
less miles of the conveyor. 

He was staring blankly 
ahead of him at the hazy sky- 
line when he became abruptly 
conscious of something seen 
from the comer of his eye — 
a black shadow skittering over 
the parched ground. It took 
him a second or two to grasp 
its meaning, and then his head 
went back and he shaded his 
eyes to look up at the gleaming 
aircar sweeping down over 
the belt. 

He sprang to his feet. The 
belt was moving almost at 
ground-level here, and with- 
out hesitating he jumped. As 
he rolled down a slope of 
loose sand, he heard a deep- 
throated shout from above 
him, but he scrambled up and 
ran without looking back. The 
car’s air-stream whistled and 
thrashed about him, but he 
raced on with his eyes fixed on 

106 



a sparse line of scrub ahead 
of him. 

He never reached it. Some- 
thing like an electric shock 
numbed all his muscles, and 
he fell headlong. He looked up 
at the man standing over him, 
huge and blond, looking at 
him with strange cold eyes. 
He felt himself picked up as 
though he were a child and 
passed up into the hovering 
aircar. 

T HEY acted with a quick 
efficiency that left Mamo 
dazed. Almost before he had 
time to wonder what was go- 
ing to happen to him, he found 
himself in Cam’s office, a cold 
room with metallic walls bath- 
ed in a brilliant green-white 
light. Cam’s massive figure 
sat facing him across a broad 
emerald desk, while Bellen 
stood against the wall with a 
scornful smile on his thin lips. 
Marno found himself hating 
the inspector with an inten- 
sity he wouldn’t have thought 
possible, because Bellen was 
one of the Valley people like 
himself. 

“Why did you run away?” 
asked Cam. 

“I wanted to see the Port,” 
Marno said. 

“But why, man — why?” 
Mamo felt confused. Every- 
thing about the Xarian seem- 
ed to advertise his alien origin 
— his size, his vast physical 
energy, the direct stare of his 
strange eyes. He couldn’t 
bring himself to answer. 

WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 




“You thought you might 
have been able to get aboard 
one of the ships. Is that it?” 

Marno was conscious of 
nothing but the blank, pene- 
trating stare that seemed to 
reach into his thoughts. Al- 
though he didn’t answer, his 
expression must have told the 
Xarian what he wanted to 
know, because for the first 
time since Marno had entered 
the room, Carn turned his con- 
centrated gaze away from 
him, looking down as he spoke 
in a low voice into some small 
instrument on his desk. Some 
of the tension went out of 
Marno’s muscles, and he was 
able to glance around the 
room. 

The walls were lined with 
what he had taken to be small 
round windows, but he now 
saw that they were video 
screens giving views of every 
part of the plant, so that Carn 
could sit here in his office and 
see at a glance everything 
that was going on in and 
about the building. There was 
even a screen giving a tele- 
scopic view for miles along the 
conveyor belt on which Marno 
had tried to escape. When he 
realized that his attempt at 
escape had been hopeless from 
the start, a hot gust of anger 
swept through him, but there 
was no way he could express 
it. 

“You don’t give me much 
choice,” said Carn, looking at 
him again. “I’ll have to move 
you.” 

ESCAPE INTO SILENCE 



And so it was that Marno 
found himself transferred 
next morning to one of the 
ore-crushing batteries. Social- 
ly, it was a step downward, 
and he worked all the morning 
in moody silence. It was easy 
work, but dull, keeping him 
isolated from all but two of 
the others who worked in the 
place. One of these was a wiry, 
gray-haired man who super- 
vised the unloading of the ore 
trucks that tipped their con- 
tents into the hopper that fed 
Marno’s crushing mill. He in- 
troduced himself as Greg. 

“I’ve been around here 
longer than anyone,” he told 
Marno. “Why did they send 
you here ?” 

“I tried to get to the Port — 
rode out on the conveyor belt,” 
said Marno. 

Greg stared at him, then 
threw back his head and 
laughed. “You hadn’t a 
chance!” He became serious. 
“I went there once. Hid in the 
back of an aircar.” 

“What was it like?” 

“I don’t know. They flew me 
straight back. I’ve been here 
ever since.” Greg looked 
around and moved a little 
closer to Marno as he spoke. 
“Things were a bit confused 
then. The Xarians had just 
taken over control — but you 
wouldn’t remember that, of 
course.” 

M ARNO looked at him in 
surprise. “Just taken over 
control, did you say ? I 

107 




thought the Xarians had al- 
ways controlled the place.” 
“Rot!” Greg spat out the 
word with a sudden savagery. 
“I can reipember when all this 
place was ruled from Earth.” 
Marno smiled tolerantly. 
“I’ve heard there was a place 
called Earth, of course. Sup- 
posed to be where our first 
forefathers came from, wasn’t 
it?” He grinned a little self- 
consciously. 

“Supposed? Supposed? It’s 
the truth, man ! That’s the hell 
of this education through 
video. They can make you 
swallow anything. Anything!” 
Greg walked up and down as 
he shouted the words, then 
spun and gripped Marno by 
the arm, his face coming very 
close to the younger man’s. 

“Do you believe all this stuff 
they give you in the philoso- 
phy sessions? This rubbish 
about reincarnation?” 

Marno hesitated. “Well . .” 

G REG shook him. “Do you 
really believe after you 
die here you’ll be born again 
on Xaron? As a Xarian?” 
“That’s what they tell us, 
and we’ve no other way of 
knowing these things — have 
we?” 

“Fool!” Greg threw the 
younger man from him, turn- 
ing his back and striding 
away. A few yards off, how- 
ever, he stopped, standing 
with his feet apart and his 
head down. Then he returned, 
planting himself directly in 

108 



front of Marno and looking 
at him searchingly. 

“You’ve got guts, though,” 
he admitted abruptly, “or you 
wouldn’t have tried to escape. 
Listen. The things I’m telling 
you are the truth. D’you un- 
derstand? Not the sort of rot 
the Xarians put over the video 
to keep you quiet. I can re- 
member when they came.” He 
gave a sour smile. “You know, 
we all come from the same 
stock, if you trace it far 
enough back. We’re all de- 
scended from people who came 
from the Earth — the Xarians 
as well as us.” 

“But that’s impossible! 
They’re so different — even a 
different color!” 

“It’s only environment that 
does that. Different sunlight, 
stronger gravity. But they’re 
still men, like you and me. 
They just know a bit more, 
that’s all. You might say they 
have hit on a more successful 
technique of living.” 

Marno stared broodingly at 
the ore fragments cascading 
into the crushing mill. 

“I’ll have to go,” said Greg. 
“Here’s Rexon coming. I’ll see 
you in the canteen.” 

As Greg went off, Marno 
watched the Xarian overseer 
approaching moving with 
long, bounding strides. He 
vaulted up onto the platform 
where Marno was standing 
and dropped a huge hand on 
his shoulder. 

“How’s the explorer set- 
tling down?” 

WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 




“Explorer?” Marno looked 
at him blankly. “I'm from the 
machine shop.” 

R EXON laughed. “I heard 
about your ride on the 
conveyor belt. I get all the ex- 
plorers up here.” He put a 
long green cigarette between 
his lips and lit it with an elec- 
tric lighter. 

Seen closely like this, the 
Xarian gave an overpowering 
impression of rugged strength, 
aggressively and blatantly 
masculine. His hair was 
neither the black of a young 
man's hair nor the gray that 
came with age, but a strange 
bleached yellow like the color 
of dry grass, and his eyes 
were the color of steel that has 
been heated and then chilled. 
Ridiculous, thought Marno, to 
maintain that these beings 
were of the same race as the 
Valley people. Who had ever 
heard of a man with blue 
eyes? 

“Don't take much notice of 
what old Greg tells you,” said 
the Xarian suddenly. “He's 
like this." He tapped his finger 
against his temple. 

Marno grinned, but inside 
he felt taut and uncertain. He 
looked thoughtfully after Rex- 
on, who sprang off the plat- 
form and strode on his way, 
speaking in a low voice into 
his wrist radio as he went. 

Mamo was resentfully con- 
scious of the shallowness of 
his knowledge of things be- 
yond his immediate surround- 



ings. After all, it was obvious 
that human life hadn't started 
here in the Valley. The very 
plants from which their food 
was processed had been intro- 
duced here from somewhere 
else — things that grew in 
tanks of water enriched by 
chemicals. The local vegeta- 
tion was all poisonous, life 
based on a different chemical 
cycle. So Greg might easily be 
right in what he had said. 

When Marno went along to 
the canteen during the meal 
break, he found Greg sitting 
alone at one of the smaller 
tables, and sat opposite him, 
glancing around the room. 
The other operators were 
younger than Greg, crowding 
together in three or four volu- 
ble groups of half a dozen or 
so. 

High in one corner of the 
room, Marno found the wide- 
angle video lens that watched 
the whole scene like, a Cyclo- 
pean eye, and the sight of its 
void stare sent a cold tingle 
down his spine. 

“Greg,” he said. “Just 
where is this place they call 
Earth?” 

The older man looked fur- 
tively about him, then leaned 
forward. “You know how to 
pick out the stars at night?” 

“Some of them.” 

“You know the fairly bright 
yellow one near Sirius — the 
one called simply the Sun? It's 
called that because it was the 
original one. The Earth is one 
of its planets, and that's 



ESCAPE INTO SILENCE 



109 




where the human race start- 
ed." 

Marno smiled tolerantly. 
“ Sounds as good a theory as 
any." 

“Damn it, man, it's true!" 
Greg slammed his fist down on 
the table, a lock of gray hair 
falling over his eyes. “They 
used to tell us more, before the 
Xarians came. Listen, it was 
like this. Hundreds and hun- 
dreds of years ago, all the hu- 
man race lived on that one 
planet. They found a way to 
use atomic power to drive a 
ship through space — first the 
space between the neighbor- 
ing planets — later, the space 
between the stars. Got that?" 

Marno nodded doubtfully. 

“Well, you can see what's 
happened. Wherever they 
found worlds they could live 
on, they established colonies. 
They were overcrowded on 
Earth, and apart from that 
some of the other planets they 
discovered had raw materials 
that were valuable to them. 
Like the radioactive minerals 
here." 

Marno looked into the black, 
glittering eyes. “But most of 
our astrium goes to Xaron, 
not to Earth." 

G REG nodded. “It does now, 
yes. Because Xaron was a 
colony that grew up. I'm 
damned if I know why — some 
people used to say the Xarians 
had some method of selective 
breeding. Others say that it's 
just because Xaron was a 

110 



bigger and naturally richer 
planet than Earth, and it at- 
tracted the best brains from 
everywhere else. Anyhow, the 
fact is that they control all of 
the inhabited systems, even 
Earth." 

Marno leaned back. “Where 
did you get all this?" 

“From the last of the 
Earthmen here. I was young 
then, but I remember them." 

“Why did they leave?" 

“I think the Xarians simply 
bought the place outright, or 
bartered some technical secret 
in exchange for it. It was all 
done quickly and smoothly and 
quietly. The Earthmen went 
and the Xarians came. Put in 
better machines, gave us all 
cheap electric cars, cheap 
video sets, Polaroid windows 
— everything we wanted." 
Greg's lips twisted in a lop- 
sided smile. “Then they put 
wire fences around the settle- 
ments and told us the fences 
were to keep us from the dan- 
ger of radioactivity outside — 
oh, they had the answers to 
everything, those boys." The 
smile widened until he showed 
his teeth with a sudden pent- 
up savagery. “It's taken me 
most of my life to realize that 
they've told us just what they 
want us to believe, whether it 
happens to be true or not." 

Marno frowned. “But you 
have got to take some things 
on trust." 

“Like the philosophy ses- 
sions?" Greg's shoulders be- 
gan to shake in silent laugh- 

WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 




ter. “You mean you really 
believe that you're going to 
have another life after this 
one — a fresh new life as a 
Xarian?” 

“If it isn't true — -well, noth- 
ing would have any meaning, 
would it?'' 

Greg laughed aloud — a 
laugh without any warmth in 
it. “Does it have to have a 
meaning?" He got slowly to 
his feet, while Marno sat star- 
ing in front of him. “I've lived 
a lot longer than you, son," he 
said quietly. “And I haven't 
seen any meaning to it yet. 
Think it over." 

And then he was gone. 

The whistle sounded for the 
return to work, and Marno 
went back to his job of watch- 
ing the ore thunder down into 
the roaring mill. The noise and 
dust and vibration seemed to 
deaden the turmoil of his 
thoughts, yet after a while he 
found his mind running back 
over the things Greg had told 
him. The more he thought of 
them, the more possible it 
seemed that Greg's fantastic 
ideas might have had some 
germ of truth behind them. 

“They’ve told us just what 
they want us to believe , 
whether it’s true or not.” 

By God, when you thought 
of it, you realized it could be 
true. 

F ROM the platform where 
he stood, Marno was able 
to look out through a window 
to the landing area where 



Rexon's aircar was parked. In 
the middle of the afternoon 
he saw a smaller aircar land 
neatly alongside it, and a few 
minutes later Rexon walked 
through the plant with a wom- 
an visitor, showing her the 
various machines. 

Marno watched, fascinated, 
for she was the first Xarian 
woman he had seen. She had 
the same strange coloring as 
the men of her race, the same 
look of eager zest. She was 
strongly built, yet active, and 
she laughed easily, a deep 
laugh that shook the whole of 
her body. 

Rexon helped her up on to 
the platform, and as Marno 
listened to him explaining the 
details of the crushing mill to 
her, he realized that he had 
stumbled on something that 
supported Greg's theory that 
their ancestors had originally 
come from the same place. 
Even between themselves, 
they spoke the same language 
that the Valley people did. 

“Glad to be going back?" 
asked Rexon after a pause. 

“Of course," said the wom- 
an. “Hard to realize I'll be on 
the ship tomorrow. It's good 
to feel that I'll soon be under 
white sunlight again, breath- 
ing good fresh air. I think I'll 
spend the first day just tour- 
ing the city." 

“I'll have time to see you go, 
before I come here," said Rex- 
on as they moved away. 

Marno stared after them as 
they went. So the woman was 



ESCAPE INTO SILENCE 



111 




going back home to Xaron in 
the morning. To the hub of all 
the vast, complex civilization 
that Greg had hinted at. 

In a flash, a plan formed in 
his mind, dazzlingly complete. 
Outside was the woman's air- 
car, with a large luggage com- 
partment similar to the one 
Greg had hidden in when he 
had been taken to the Port. 
Greg had been brought 
straight back, but Marno felt 
that once he got there, he 
would escape — he was fore- 
warned, and on arrival he 
would have only the woman to 
deal with. Certainly she was 
strong and quick, but with the 
factor of surprise on his side, 
he should easily get away, 
from her. And tomorrow a 
ship was leaving for Xaron. 
All he had to do was get 
aboard during the night. Could 
he? He refused to think of 
failure. He simply had to be 
aboard. 

As soon as Rexon and the 
woman were out of sight, 
Marno slipped away from his 
machine and ran down the 
length of the plant. Recklessly, 
he dashed through the Xari- 
an's office and out on to the 
cement landing stage. Rexon 
would pass around the other 
side of the plant, and wouldn't 
be back near Marno's machine 
until after the woman had left. 

Marno tried frantically to 
open the luggage compart- 
ment, but without success. He 
looked up at the windows of 
the plant, but they were blank 

112 



with reflected sky. Any min- 
ute now, Rexon and the wom- 
an might return. 

It occurred to Marno that 
the compartment might be 
controlled from inside the 
cabin. He opened the door, 
stared at the glittering banks 
of instruments. Then he found 
that the rear seat could be 
swung forward, giving access 
to the luggage compartment 
while in flight. He wormed his 
way in, pulling the seat back 
behind him, sealing himself 
into darkness. 

T HE thudding of his heart 
seemed to echo through the 
metal compartment ; then, 
after what seemed an age, he 
heard voices. He felt the move- 
ment of springs as someone 
climbed aboard. There was the 
solid click of a door, the vi- 
brant hum of the compact 
little nuclear motors. Then the 
machine was climbing, lifting 
straight up from the ground 
with a speed that forced him 
hard against the floor. The 
air began to whistle about the 
smooth hull. The flight was 
bumpy at first, but soon they 
had climbed into smoother air. 

He had a feeling of exulta- 
tion, the feeling that this time 
he must succeed. He would 
have liked to be able to look 
out at the country over which 
they were flying, but it could 
not be helped — the main fact 
was that he was escaping. 
They flew level for a long 
time. Then he suddenly dou- 

WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 




bled up, gasping as a sharp 
dive caught him in the pit of 
the stomach. 

The note of the motors 
changed and he felt the ma- 
chine hovering. Then it was 
on the ground and the hum of 
the motors ceased. 

Mamo suddenly began to 
tremble, a chill fear gripping 
him. He found himself listen- 
ing, listening, wondering what 
had caused this irrational ter- 
ror that was rising in him. 
And then he knew. 

It was the silence. The 
abysmal silence. Never in his 
life had he heard anything 
like it. Even in the arid desert 
there had been noise — the 
rumble of the conveyor belt — 
and in the Valley there was 
always the sound of machin- 
ery, roaring endlessly on 
through day and night. Yet 
here there was only this deaf- 
ening stillness. 

As he listened, though, he 
realized that there were 
sounds in the background. An 
occasional voice. Footsteps. 
The hum of some passing ve- 
hicle or aircraft, fading quick- 
ly away again. 

Then, suddenly, light, blind- 
ing him. The whole side of the 
luggage compartment was 
open. He blinked out into a 
walled courtyard bordered 
with exotic plants. A strange 
house with translucent sap- 
phire walls towered over one 
side of it, and a hangarlike 
building of yellow metal open- 
ed off one end, the whole 



scene bright and pallid in a 
harsh artificial lighting that 
blazed from somewhere high 
above it. 

Before his eyes were used 
to the glare, the woman came 
briskly around the side of the 
car. She stopped, rigid. 

“Come out of there.” Her 
voice was amused rather than 
angry. 

Marno slid quietly out of the 
car, his eyes on the walls of 
the court yard. At the end — 
a metal gate, open. At once he 
was running. 

He heard the click of plastic 
heels behind him. When he 
was halfway to the gate, he 
felt the woman’s arms around 
him, lifting him off the ground. 

“Lars!” she called. “Lars!” 

Frantic, he tried to kick 
back at her legs, but his feet 
thrashed the air uselessly. 

A massive-shouldered giant 
of a man with stiff yellow hair 
appeared at the door of the 
hangar. In an instant, he was 
across the courtyard in a tre- 
mendous, springing run, arms 
held wide. The woman re- 
leased Marno, and even as he 
fell the man called Lars 
caught him, swinging him to 
his feet with an arm twisted 
behind his back. There was no 
question of a struggle — the 
man could have snapped 
Mamo’s arm like a dry twig. 

“Where was he?” asked the 
yellow-haired giant. 

“In there,” indicated the 
woman. “One of Rexon’s 
boys.” 



ESCAPE INTO SILENCE 



113 




M ARNO felt as though all 
the strength had been 
drained out of him. The giant 
marched him toward the 
strange house, while the wom- 
an walked ahead, the metallic 
fabric of her dress gleaming 
under the fierce white light, 
with its highlights showing 
the movement of her muscles 
as she walked. 

They went into a large 
room, more beautifully fur- 
nished than any place Marno 
had ever imagined, with the 
same dazzling light pouring 
down from a luminous ceiling. 
The woman closed the door, 
while the man sat Marno in a 
chair that seemed to have been 
molded of a single block of 
plastic foam. 

“We can give him to Rexon 
tonight,” he said. 

Marno put his head in his 
hands. His eyes felt hot and 
moist. The man shook him by 
the shoulder with a gentleness 
he hadn’t expected. 

“Why did you come here, 
son?” he asked. 

Marno looked up, and once 
his eyes met the other man’s 
bright, cold stare, he couldn’t 
look away. 

“Just relax,” he heard the 
deep voice telling him. “Relax. 
That’s it. Breathe deeply and 
let yourself go. That’s right. 
Now you know you can trust 
us. All we want to do is help 
you. Tell us all about it.” 
Marno felt dazed and con- 
fused. He wasn’t conscious of 
anything but the weird, pale 

114 



eyes, and somewhere behind 
them the feeling that these 
were people to whom he could 
confide his most secret 
thoughts. 

“I want to go to Xaron,” 
he said. 

“But you’ve been told you’ll 
go there some day, haven’t 
you ?” 

“Yes. But I — I wasn’t sure. 
They tell us that, but I don’t 
think I believe it. Do you?” 

The woman’s sudden ripple 
of laughter brought his atten- 
tion back to his immediate 
surroundings. The man called 
Lars glanced at her and said 
something quickly that Marno 
didn’t understand. Then Lars 
brought his eyes back on him. 

Lars was about to speak 
again when the woman said, 
“Lars, what about Deren? He 
wanted to examine one of 
them. Why couldn’t we take 
this one with us?” 

The man looked at her 
again. “Why not? It might as 
well be him.” Once more he 
turned to Marno. “You really 
want to go to Xaron, do you? 
Without knowing what it’s 
like?” 

“Yes,” said Marno emphati- 
cally. 

The man left him and walk- 
ed down the long room. He 
walked straight toward the 
far wall, yet just before he 
reached it an arched doorway 
suddenly opened in it, so that 
he walked through into an- 
other room beyond. After he 
had passed through, Marno 

WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 




found that he was looking at 
what appeared to be solid wall 
again. 

The woman came across the 
room toward Marno with a 
long glass filled with a spar- 
kling violet liquid. - 

“Drink this,” she said in a 
quiet voice. 

The stuff seemed hot and 
cold in his throat at the same 
time, and fumes seemed to 
rise at the back of his nose, 
but after he had finished the 
glass he felt better. He looked 
up to find Lars standing be- 
side him again. 

“Young fellow, you’re lucky. 
We’ll be able to take you with 
us. A friend of ours back home 
wants to examine one of you 
Valley people.” 

Marno began to stammer 
incoherent thanks, but Lars 
raised his hand. 

“I can’t promise to bring 
you back. But they’ll find 
something for you to do 
there.” 

Marno was afraid to show 
his eagerness. “I don’t care if 
I never come back.” 

“All right. But remember 
what I said.” 

T HE woman touched a con- 
trol on one of the walls 
and a section of it became 
transparent, so that they were 
able to look out over the court- 
yard. Marno could see varicol- 
ored metallic and crystalline 
buildings beyond the wall of 
the yard, and he was amazed 
at the rich diversity of their 

ESCAPE INTO SILENCE 



design. The great red disc of 
the sun was touching the hori- 
zon now, but the scene was 
still lit by the chill glare of 
a regular pattern of lights sus- 
pended or floating in the air 
high overhead. 

The woman pointed upward. 

“Look,” she said. “The 
ship’s coming down.” 

Marno rushed across to her 
side and stared up. Dropping 
down out of the darkening 
purple sky was the spear- 
point of flame from the brak- 
ing rockets of the spaceship. 
The thing was colossal, bluntly 
cylindrical, gleaming like sil- 
ver high up in the red sun- 
light. The hissing scream of 
its rockets was the most stir- 
ring sound he had ever heard. 
He watched it until the roof 
of the neighboring house cut 
it from his view. 

“We’ll be on it at sunrise,” 
said Lars. 

“You’ll like it on Xaron,” 
the woman told Marno. “It’s 
a huge garden, compared to 
this place. Try to imagine a 
city with fifty million people 
in it, stretching for a hun- 
dred miles along a coastline, 
with hundreds of little islands 
linked by bridges. Buildings 
as high as your mountains, 
aircars everywhere like a 
swarm of insects. There are 
so many things to do — you’ll 
see for yourself.” 

They gave Marno a meal of 
strange varied foods that he 
didn’t like, then showed him 
to a room with a divan of 



115 




plastic foam. Lying alone in 
the dark, he thought over all 
the things that had happened 
to him since the afternoon. He 
was hardly able to believe his 
good fortune. And then a 
thought came to him that 
swept away his dreams like an 
icy gale. 

Rexon. He remembered lis- 
tening to him talking to the 
woman back at the ore-crush- 
ing plant. “I’ll have time to 
see you leave in the morning” 
— that was what he had said. 

When Rexon saw Marno in 
the morning, he would want to 
take him back. The thought of 
the last-minute loss of every- 
thing he had fought for kept 
him awake, sweating in the 
dark. Somewhere out near the 
white splendor of Altair was 
a world of shining cities and 
luxuriant forests, of broad 
turquoise oceans spangled 
with islands that sparkled like 
jewels. And a stone’s throw 
away in the darkness was the 
ship that was leaving for this 
world in a few hours. The fear 
of missing the journey kept 
him rigid and wide-eyed. 

M ORNING was a bewilder- 
ing nightmare. They 
forced Marno to eat some- 
thing, hustled him into an air- 
car, and whirred over the 
rooftops toward the gleaming 
bulk of the spaceship that 
towered in the dawn air. They 
landed on the nearer side of a 
great embankment marked 
here and there with black and 

116 



yellow signs that read “ Dan- 
ger — Blast Zone” and waited 
near the entrance to a narrow 
high-walled passageway that 
zigzagged through to the other 
side. 

Another aircar swept down 
in a wide arc and landed. It 
looked somehow familiar, and 
Marno realized why when he 
saw the man who stepped out 
of it. 

It was Rexon. 

Marno shrank against the 
side of the car, edging his way 
round it to keep out of Rexon’s 
line of sight. He thought of 
making a dash for the pas- 
sageway through the embank- 
ment, but he realized that 
would bring him into full 
view. He could only stand 
there with a tense emptiness 
in him. 

Rexon walked into view ; he 
shook Lars by the hand, put 
his arm around the woman’s 
shoulder. Then he seemed to 
see Marno for the first time. 

“So you weren’t content to 
wait for your next life to see 
Xaron, were you?” he asked. 

Marno forced himself to 
look straight into the coldly 
observant eyes, although his 
knees shook with the tension. 
He didn’t know what to say. 
If he gave the wrong answer, 
he might be taken back to the 
crushing plant. He thought 
suddenly of Greg, with his 
untidy gray hair and his sour, 
defeated smile, and the tired- 
ness that showed now and 
then about his eyes. He had 

WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 




tried to escape once, only 
once, and they hadn't given 
him another chance. 

Then he realized that Rex- 
on’s eyes had a flicker of 
laughter in them, as though 
they were sharing some joke, 
and with an effort he managed 
to smile. 

“ Sometimes I think we un- 
derestimate you fellows," said 
Rexon thoughtfully. He turn- 
ed to Lars. “ You know, I think 
the standard philosophy is due 
for some revision, don't you?" 

Lars nodded. “I'll take it up 
with Deren. This alters things, 
doesn't it?" 

The ringing note of an am- 
plified bell sounded from the 
ship. Lars and the woman 
made their farewells to Rexon, 
and led Marno through the 
angled passageway that cut 
the embankment, bringing 
them out onto the scorched 
cement of the blast zone. They 
climbed the great escalator 
that reached up a hundred feet 
or more to the airlock of the 
ship. Lars touched Marno's 
arm. 

“Take a last look at it," he 
said, waving his hand toward 
the dry red hills with their 
patches of purple scrub. 

Marno gave a brief glance 
over his shoulder, then con- 
tinued to gaze up at the flange 
of the airlock. At last, they 
stood on it, and Marno was 
able to look into the interior 
of the ship, into a room crowd- 
ed with complex apparatus. 
Brilliant light reflected from 



metal surfaces. He waited 
alongside the woman as Lars 
went quickly inside. 

“It's beautiful where we're 
going," the woman told him. 
“Cool and fresh and peaceful. 
No roar of crushing batteries, 
no dust. All so qiuet." 

“Quiet?" 

“I don't suppose you'd be 
able to imagine what that's 
like. You've never been where 
it's really quiet." 

A siren warned them of the 
impending takeoff. 

“Come on," said the woman, 
and stepped in through the 
massive door. 

Marno looked back. The es- 
calator's steps were motion- 
less now, and it was automati- 
cally disconnecting from the 
flange, beginning to fold back. 
Marno stepped to the edge of 
the flange. 

“Marno!" called Lars from 
the doorway. “Come in. 
Quick!" 

Trembling, Marno poised 
for a second on the edge of 
the metal platform. Then he 
sprang across the widening 
gap to the escalator. 

“Marno!" thundered the 
voice behind him, but now he 
was running down the steps 
three or four at a time. In 
seconds now, the blast would 
be starting. 

H E WAS panting when he 
reached the ground, but 
he rushed on across the flame- 
blistered cement toward the 
shielding embankment, his 



ESCAPE INTO SILENCE 



117 




ears keyed for the first sound 
of the rockets. If they began 
to fire before he reached shel- 
ter, he was finished. 

He was just at the passage- 
way when the first hollow roar 
broke the tight-stretched si- 
lence, its shock-wave hitting 
him like a fist between the 
shoulder blades. With his 
shadow flung ahead of him by 
the flame, he lurched on, heart 
pounding. Then he was around 
the first of the corners. 

He came out on the far side 
of the embankment like a leaf 
blown by the wind. Behind, 
the rockets lifted in an eerie 
scream. 

He saw Rexon just getting 
into his aircar. The Xarian 
looked up at the rising bulk 
of the ship, and as he did so, 
he caught sight of Marno. He 
waited while Marno staggered 
up to the car. 

“Could I — ” began Marno, 
and leaned against the side of 
the car, gulping air. “Could I 
ride back with you?” 

Rexon opened the door. 
“Get in!” he shouted above 



the roar of the blast, and 
Marno slid in alongside him. 

As the car lifted and skim- 
med away over the parched 
red wilderness, Marno said 
nothing. He stared ahead 
along the straight line of the 
conveyor belt until he saw the 
buildings of the Valley come 
up over the horizon, the fa- 
miliar lines of identical little 
houses, the beetlelike electric 
cars, the slender dark girls in 
their bright dresses, and as 
they swept down to land he 
felt an odd sense of satisfac- 
tion. 

But only when he stepped 
out of the aircar did he real- 
ize what it was that he had 
really missed. It was the un- 
ending roar of the machinery, 
the eternal torrent of sound 
that had filled the Valley be- 
fore he was born, sound that 
would some day thunder in the 
ears of his children. As he 
walked into the plant through 
the vibrant air, he felt at 
peace. 

He was home.

The usual way to test for accurate translation is to re-feed a translated 
sentence into the computer and compare it with the original. Almost 
classical among computer translator jokes is the input: “The spirit is 
willing but the flesh is weak,” and its twice-translated (from English 
to Russian to English) output: “The vodka is strong, but the meat is 
rotten.” 

Programming a computer to translate language is like dressing a 
baby: you know what you’re trying to do, but the computer doesn’t care.

HORNETS' 

NEST 

By LLOYD BIGGLE, Jr. 



T HEY sat in the captain’s 
quarters, relaxed in the 
easy silence of close friend- 
ship as they absently sipped 
drinks and watched the moni- 
tor of the ship’s scanner 
screen. There was Captain 
Miles Front, big, formidable- 
looking, a healthy and robust 
forty-five. There was Clyde 
Paulson, his brilliant young 
navigator. There was the 
expedition’s chief scientist, 
Doctor John Walter, a pleas- 
ant-looking, balding man of 
indeterminate age. 

It was Paulson who broke 
the silence. “I have an impor- 



119 




tant mission of my own,” he 
said. 

They regarded him with 
amused skepticism, and he 
grinned good-naturedly. 

“An ancestor of mine, my 
great-great-great — how many 
generations has it been now? 
Anyway, old Grandfather 
Paulson left Earth in some 
kind of disgrace. The details 
have been forgotten, down 
through the years, but the 
legend has been passed along 
as a family joke. I don’t know 
whether he joined the colo- 
nists to run away, or whether 
that was someone’s idea of a 
good way to get rid of him. 
Anway, it’s kind of a pledge 
to the family’s honor that the 
first one to get back to Earth 
will check up, and see whether 
Grandfather Paulson has been 
exonerated, or pardoned, or 
acquitted, or whatever. That’s 
my mission. Not that it will 
make any difference to Grand- 
father Paulson one way or the 
other.” 

“So that’s why you were so 
eager to make this trip,” the 
captain said. “You needn’t 
have bothered. A lot of chance 
you will have to rake up a 
scandal that old!” 

“I thought it was a pretty 
good excuse,” said Paulson. 

D octor Walter pointed 

at a boldly glimmering 
star. “You’re sure that’s the 
one?” 

Paulson grinned, and Cap- 
tain Front chuckled dryly. 

120 



“Disappointed to find it 
looks just like another star?” 
the captain said. 

“Maybe,” Walter said 
dreamily. “This is a different 
kind of a mission for me. It’s 
a pilgrimage. There are mad- 
dening blank spaces in the 
information that the colonists 
brought with them about this 
solar system. I hope to fill in 
some of those. I’d like to fill 
all of them in.” 

“You may be able to,” the 
captain said. “Remember that 
Earth’s scientists haven’t 
been standing still all this 
time. They must have pro- 
gressed beyond the point 
they’d reached when the colo- 
nists left. Perhaps they’ll have 
everything you want waiting 
for you.” 

Walter shrugged, and the 
captain chuckled again, and 
said to Paulson, “I’ve disap- 
pointed him. He doesn’t want 
to find the answers on file. 
He wants to dig them out for 
himself.” 

Doctor Walter said to the 
captain, “What’s your mis- 
sion?” 

“To get us there and back. 
And frankly — ” he turned to 
look at the lone, flickering star 
— “there are angles to this 
thing that bother me. It’s just 
possible that our mother plan- 
et might not be at all glad to 
see us.” 

“It should greet us with 
open arms,” Walter said. “The 
population problem was seri- 
ous when the colonists left. It 



LLOYD BIGGLE, Jr. 




will be critical by now. We can 
use the people, and Earth 
should be able to spare as 
many as we want. Our science 
is bound to be ahead of 
Earth's in many respects, and 
we know they can't match our 
starships, or we would have 
heard from them before now. 
Ships that bring out new colo- 
nists can take essential raw 
materials back to Earth. Co- 
operation will benefit all of 
us." 

“It should," the captain 
said. “But we don't know how 
Earth will look at it. When the 
original colonists left, there 
was supposed to be a new ship 
every couple of years. Nothing 
has been heard from Earth 
since. It looks as if Earth 
simply wrote us off and forgot 
about us. Now that we've built 
our own civilization, and may- 
be done far better than Earth 
expected, we might not be wel- 
comed back. Earth might be 
jealous. Or it might have a 
guilty conscience. It should 
have!" 

“Faulty navigation,” Paul- 
son suggested. 

“An occasional ship might 
go astray. Not all of them. No, 
the thing has me worried. 
That's why I want to hit Pluto 
Base and planet-hop our way 
in. Give Earth notice that 
we're coming, and a chance to 
get used to the idea before we 
arrive.” 

Doctor Walter brightened. 
“Pluto Base. I wonder if they 
ever found a tenth planet.” 



C LYDE PAULSON laid out 
a perfect interception 
course for Pluto, and he was 
still grinning with satisfac- 
tion when they brought the 
ship down. The captain ro- 
tated the scanner and looked 
broodingly at the frigid, air- 
less landscape. 

“Is this Pluto Base or isn't 
it?" he growled. 

“It is," Paulson said con- 
fidently. 

“They're taking their time 
about sending out a reception 
committee. They should have 
picked us up hours ago. Some 
security system!" 

They waited, straining their 
eyes to pick out details. Doc- 
tor Walter came into the con- 
trol room. He glanced at the 
screen and exclaimed, “Why, 
there's nothing there!” 

“Pluto Base is under- 
ground,” the captain said, ro- 
tating the scanner again. “Or 
at least it was. I imagine it 
still is.” 

“ Stop ! " Paulson shouted. 
“Over there on that hill — 
wouldn't that be the base 
entrance?” 

The captain threw in the 
magnification unit. 

“It could be,” Doctor Walter 
said. 

“It is,” the captain said. 
“And the airlock is open.” 
They landed, watched, saw 
nothing move, and entered. 

They went cautiously 
through the empty corridors. 
Equipment was there. Sup- 
plies were there. Machinery 

121 



HORNETS’ NEST 




was in operating condition. 
All signs indicated a hasty 
departure. 

“They left just before 
lunch,” Doctor Walter said in 
the mess room. “The food is 
still here, laid out for them.” 

“All we’d have to do,” Cap- 
tain Front said, “is close the 
airlock, start the air machines 
and take over. The supplies 
would last us indefinitely. I 
can understand that they 
might find reasons to abandon 
this base, but why would they 
pull out and leave all this 
stuff?” 

“The transmitters are in 
working condition,” a commu- 
nications officer said. “It’d be 
easy to start the power sta- 
tion. Shall we call Earth and 
ask them?” 

The captain said, “Now that 
I think of it, we haven’t pick- 
ed up any signals from Earth, 
have we?” 

There was an uneasy si- 
lence. The captain looked 
around at the faces that peer- 
ed grotesquely at him through 
spacesuit faceplates. 

“Then we won’t call Earth,” 
he said, “until we’re certain 
just what might be there to 
answer us.” 

THEY SPIRALED slowly 
in toward the sun, probing, 
exploring, searching, con- 
stantly alert and cautious. 
They touched Neptune and 
Uranus, and such moons as 
looked promising. They touch- 
ed a half-dozen of the moons 

122 



of Saturn. The bases, where 
they found them, were deso- 
late and abandoned. 

Not until they reached the 
moons of Jupiter did they find 
the first dusty remnants of 
human bodies. 

“Whatever it was,” Doctor 
Walter said, “it happened 
quickly.” 

“Attack?” the captain ask- 
ed. 

“I can’t believe it. An at- 
tack can take people by sur- 
prise, but they’re not too 
surprised to know what’s hap- 
pening. Some of them would 
take defensive measures. Most 
of them would act for their 
own safety. These people were 
stricken down in the everyday 
routine of living.” 

“Disease? Plague?” 

“It wouldn’t strike everyone 
at the same instant. This did.” 
“We might as well go on,” 
the captain said. “If it’s neces- 
sary, we can hit any of these 
places again on the way out.” 

F ROM that moment they all 
knew. No one talked about 
it. No one even hinted at the 
cold fear that twisted within 
him. The communications men 
continued to search vainly for 
signals. The scientists carried 
on their observations. The 
ship’s officers rotated the 
scanner toward a far-off cor- 
ner of emptiness and strained 
to see a fleck of light that 
would be Earth when they 
came closer. And they all knew 
what they would find there. 

LLOYD BIGGLE, Jr. 




On Mars, it was no longer 
desolate bases. It was annihi- 
lated cities — except that stone 
and mortar and steel were un- 
touched. The people had been 
struck down as unsuspectingly 
as if a remote deity had sud- 
denly decided upon doomsday. 
The flimsy atmosphere domes 
had lost their air and the 
buildings stood in excellent 
preservation, a futile monu- 
ment to a wasted dream. 

And then there was Earth. 
Rolling green hills, majestic 
cities, awesome natural won- 
ders, all familiar, like a long- 
forgotten love. Majestic cities 
of the dead. Towns and vil- 
lages and hamlets and solitary 
dwellings of the. dead. 

They had known what they 
would find, and they found it, 
and still were stunned. 

“It hit the whole solar sys- 
tem,” Doctor Walter said, 
snapping his fingers, “just 
like that.” 

Paulson objected. “There 
weren’t any bodies at the 
outer bases. Those people had 
a chance to get away — or at 
least to try.” 

The captain nodded. “I have 
a hunch that Venus and Mer- 
cury were caught. If so, that 
means it struck the solar sys- 
tem out as far as Jupiter’s 
moons. Something from the 
sun?” 

Walter pondered the sug- 
gestion, and shook his head. 
“Heat would have left traces. 
So would any kind of radia- 
tion I know of that could do 



this. How long has it been? 
We should be able to pick up 
the exact date.” 

They landed at New Wash- 
ington. The specialists, the 
experts, went grimly to work. 
The archeologist who had 
come to probe eagerly some 
faded secrets of Earth’s an- 
cient peoples found himself 
with the problem of an extinct 
interplanetary civilization. 
The botanist could only won- 
der at the survival of abun- 
dant flora when all fauna had 
perished. The bacteriologists, 
the chemists, the physicists, 
the military intelligence officer 
masquerading as a diplomat, 
all pondered the possible 
source of the catastrophe. 

Clyde Paulson, unwanted by 
the scientists and unneeded 
by his ship, found his way 
into the military records sec- 
tion and gazed disheartened 
at the mountainous files of 
films. 

“Well,” he said, “since I’ve 
got nothing better to do . .” 

H E SEARCHED the index 
references, found Paul- 
sons in quantity, but no men- 
tion of his dishonored ances- 
tor. 

“Odd,” he said. “He couldn’t 
have been such a scoundrel 
that they destroyed his rec- 
ords.” 

He prowled through the 
building, sampling the price- 
less military secrets of a lost 
civilization, getting himself 
lost, becoming more frustrated 

123 



HORNETS’ NEST 




by the hour. He sat down to 
analyze his problem. 

“Permanent records,” he 
mused. “Those would be rec- 
ords that are complete. In 
other words, when a man’s 
service was terminated, they 
filmed his records and put 
them in the permanent file. 
There should be another file 
for those on active service. 
Which means that old Grand- 
father Paulson was still con- 
sidered on active service when 
it happened. Which is odd, be- 
cause he left with the colo- 
nists. Could that mean the 
colonists . .” 

Impossible. A shipload of 
colonists wouldn’t kill off the 
civilization that mothered it, 
and then leave for the stars in 
search of breathing room — 
even if it had the power. 

He continued his search, 
and eventually he found active 
records of the military serv- 
ices. They were crudely kept 
files containing paper docu- 
ments and records, and even 
these were only abstracts of 
service records. He compre- 
hended, at length, that the 
complete records were kept 
with the man at his point of 
service. What a prodigious 
amount of effort to devote to 
such a simple matter as rec- 
ord keeping ! 

“Paulson, Paul,” the file 
said. “Space Navy. Serial 
Number 0329 B9472 A8974.” 

Paulson took the file and 
carried it out into the fresh 
air, to a plot of tangled grass 



where there were no bleached 
bones to dishearten him. He 
settled down to read of the 
bright development of a prom- 
ising military career that had 
ended in disgrace. 

Paul Paulson had held the 
rank of captain in the Space 
Navy. He was a pilot of the 
highest qualifications. He had 
served with distinction on a 
number of dangerous mis- 
sions. His last assignment had 
been the Space Navy Base on 
Callisto, Jupiter Command. 
The record concluded with the 
notation of a court-martial on 
a charge of insubordination, 
and the terse verdict: 

Guilty. 

Accompanying the file was 
a smaller folder, labeled, 
“Summary of Court-Martial 
Proceedings Against Paul 
Paulson.” The contents of the 
folder had been withdrawn 
for study, a notation informed 
him. He opened it and found a 
single sheet of paper that had 
been overlooked or unwanted. 

P AULSON said to the cap- 
tain, “Have they found 
anything?” 

“They found one thing. 
This happened just about two 
Earth months after the colo- 
nists left Pluto Base. I remem- 
ber something in the old 
records about their communi- 
cations with Earth breaking 
down sooner than they’d ex- 
pected. Now we know why. It 
looks as if the human race 
missed extermination by an 

LLOYD BIGGLE, Jr. 



124 




eyelash. What have you been 
up to?” 

“I found a personnel file on 
Grandfather Paulson. I sup- 
pose no one will object to my 
taking it.” 

“None of the natives Fve 
met will object. Have you vin- 
dicated the old man?” 

“He received a court-mar- 
tial for insubordination. That 
would be no disgrace in our 
family. Funny thing, though 
— the trial summary is miss- 
ing, except for one statement 
by Grandfather Paulson. In- 
terested?” 

“Let's have it.” 

Captain Front took the pa- 
per and read: 

“To whom it may concern : 
It is true that I have refused 
to obey the orders of the Sci- 
entific Mission, in spite of the 
fact that my commanding offi- 
cer ordered me to do so. It is 
true that I made a serious at- 
tempt to break the neck of the 
Scientific Mission's chairman, 
Doctor Harold Dolittle. It is 
also true that I sincerely re- 
gret this attempt. 

“I hold nothing personal 
against Doctor Dolittle. Scien- 
tists have been playing at ex- 
terminating the human race 
for centuries, and it's proba- 
bly only an accident that one 
of them hasn't succeeded be- 
fore, now. And since Doctor 
Dolittle actually has succeed- 
ed, breaking his neck would 
not help the situation. It was 
bound to happen sooner or 
later, anyway. 

HORNETS’ NEST 



“When I w^as a kid back in 
Minnesota, there was a boy on 
our street named Fitzharris 
Holloway. We all called him 
Fizz, and he wasn't a bad kid 
except that he was just too cu- 
rious to live. Let a bunch of us 
stand around a puddle and it 
would always be Fizz who 
would drop a big rock and 
splash mud all over our Sun- 
day clothes and get the lot of 
us whipped. He'd drop it just 
to see what would happen. The 
average mentality could figure 
that out without the experi- 
ment, but Fizz's mentality 
wasn't average. It was scienti- 
fic. He had to see for himself. 
Let us find a hornets' nest and 
it would be Fizz who had to 
punch a stick into it. He'd get 
stung, of course, but so would 
the rest of us. 

“You've heard that old gag 
about throwing an egg into an 
electric fan? Almost everyone 
has, I guess, and been satisfied 
just to hear about it. But Fizz 
had to see for himself. He got 
egg splashed all over himself 
and his ma's new dress, and 
he wore a pillow to his meals 
for the next three days. 

“They'll never forget Fizz 
at old Central High School. 
The scars he left in that chem- 
istry laboratory will last as 
long as the building. All the 
teacher had to say was, ‘Don't 
do this,' and there would be 
Fizz out in the lab trying it 
out. 

“I figure now that Fizz was 
just a natural-born scientist. 



125 




Most of us are curious about 
things as children — curious 
within limits, that is — but we 
outgrow it. A scientist never 
outgrows it, and the law of 
averages gives us a certain 
number of irresponsible scien- 
tists. Fizz met his end in a bar 
one night, when he dropped a 
lighted cigarette into the bulg- 
ing front of a woman's dress. 
She picked up a bottle and 
broke it over his head, and the 
jury called it justifiable homi- 
cide. If all natural-born scien- 
tists had run squarely into the 
consequences of their curiosity 
at such an early age, the hu- 
man race might be no further 
along than the Bronze Age, 
but at least it would have a 
future. 

“I attempted to resign my 
Space Navy commission when 
I first learned that I was to 
assist Doctor Dolittle in his 
experiments. Contrary to nor- 
mal procedure, my resignation 
was not accepted. I am now 
requesting permission to re- 
sign and join the star colo- 
nists. They have an opening 
for a reserve pilot and will 
favorably consider my appli- 
cation. I believe the risks of 
star colonization to be consid- 
erably less than those of re- 
maining in this solar system. 
Doctor Dolittle has been pok- 
ing at a hornets' nest, and the 
more light-years away I am 
when the hornets come out, 
the better I'll like it. 

“Respectfully yours, Cap- 
tain Paul Paulson.'' 

126 



C APTAIN FRONT stroked 
his cheek thoughtfully. 
“So they let him go. And then, 
two months after the colonists 
left, this happened. What sort 
of experiments was this Scien- 
tific Mission carrying on?'' 

“The only thing I could find 
was Grandfather's state- 
ment." 

“I wonder if they were con- 
ducting some kind of solar ex- 
periments. I never thought of 
a sun as being a hornets' nest. 
What comes out when you 
poke a sun?" 

“Grandfather was attached 
to the Jupiter Base Command, 
on Callisto. We might find 
more information there. Any 
chance of hitting Callisto 
again on the way out?" 

“We'll see what we find 
here. If this looks like a likely 
clue, we'll have to follow it up. 
So far, there haven't been any 
other clues. Let's see what 
Walter says about this." 

VAINLY THEY searched 
such mute records as Earth 
had to offer. They sifted the 
bones of the Venus colonists 
and looked in at Mercury 
Base, where death had inter- 
rupted the lonely vigil of a 
small group of scientists and 
soldiers. Then they turned 
back. Mars again, then an as- 
teroid base, and then Callisto. 

And the complete file on 
Captain Paul Paulson. 

Paulson searched further 
and found the records of the 
Scientific Mission. He carried 



LLOYD BIGGLE, Jr. 




an armload of documents to 
Captain Front. 

“Found any answers?” the 
captain asked. 

“Not all of them,” Paulson 
said, “but enough.” 

“Solar research?” 

“No. Jupiter research.” 
“Odd,” the captain mused. 
“Whatever happened hit 
everything from the Jupiter 
moons through the system 
clear to Mercury.” 

“This Doctor Dolittle,” 
Paulson said, “was doing 
some intensified research that 
concerned Jupiter. First he 
used a series of atomic war- 
heads to test the depth of the 
atmosphere. Then he wanted 
someone to pilot a ship on a 
tight parabolic orbit that 
would take him closer to Ju- 
piter than any human had 
ever been before. As an added 
twist, the ship was to be par- 
alleled closer in by a guided 
missile that could broadcast 
instrument readings. Grand- 
father Paulson was ordered to 
pilot the ship. He refused. He 
was tried for insubordination, 
convicted, and sentenced to a 
prison term.” 

“But he left with the star 
colonists.” 

“Yes, by escaping from con- 
finement. He got out to Pluto 
Base and stowed away on the 
starship. Jupiter Command 
was furious when it found out 
what had happened. The com- 
mandant ordered the starship 
to turn around and bring him 
back. The starship was out of 



the system by then and it re- 
fused.” 

“Well, that's an interesting 
bit of family history, but it 
doesn't explain what wiped 
out humanity.” 

Paulson said grimly, 
“Doesn't it?” 

“Does it?” 

“Grandfather Paulson said 
Doctor Dolittle had been pok- 
ing at a hornets' nest. He was 
poking at Jupiter, and it was 
vigorous poking — he used 
atomic warheads. Then, when 
Grandfather refused to pilot 
Dolittle's ship, Dolittle found 
another pilot who would. They 
went into their orbit and made 
the trip successfully, but they 
lost their guided missile. Then 
a few weeks later they found 
it again.” 

CAPTAIN FRONT said 
blankly, “They lost it on Ju- 
piter — and then they found 
it?” 

“The missile came shooting 
back at them,” said Paulson. 
“I gather that it was only a 
piece of luck that let them 
capture it, because the mecha- 
nism had been altered in a 
way they called ‘astonishing,' 
and it used an unknown fuel. 
Its speed was something they 
couldn't believe. It represent- 
ed several hundred years' 
progress for them at one 
crack, and it gave them the 
secret of star travel. They 
went to work on it, and they 
were too enthused to give 
much thought to what else

might come up from Jupiter.” 
The captain walked over to 
a port and looked out at the 
sky. “Jupiter?” 

“It must have been hell for 
something native to Jupiter to 
take to space travel, but some- 
one — or something — was as 
mad as a hornet. Atomic war- 
heads wouldn't soothe any- 
one's feelings.” 

“So it — or they — headed in 
toward the sun.” 

“At unbelievable speeds,” 
Paulson said. “Those on the 
outer planets either had time 
to try to escape, or maybe to 
come to help.” 

“And all the humanity they 
could find — how did they do 
it?” 

“I hope we never know. 
How did they ever get off Ju- 
piter? Not even our starship 
could manage that. What's the 
escape velocity?” 

“Too much.” 

“Well, I found the study 
they made of that missile. It's 
an advance in mankind's 
knowledge — at the price of 
mankind.” 

“I'll have Walter go over 
it.” 

“Where is he?” Paulson 
said. “I haven't seen him for 
days.” 

The captain stiffened. “My 
God ! He's down on Amalthea, 
conducting some Jupiter ex- 
periments!” 

T HE desolate, rock-strewn 
surface of Amalthea curv- 
ed sharply away from them to 

128 



its shallow horizon, and the 
light in the sky was Jupiter. 
The huge disc of the planet 
hovered menacingly above 
them. 

The churning bands of 
clouds writhed and struggled 
like live beings in the throes 
of mortal agony. Even as they 
watched, the colors deepened 
and faded, yellow clouds boil- 
ed into the brown of the North 
Equatorial Belt, and the enig- 
matic, so-called red spot shim- 
mered with a repulsive, 
grayish pinkness. 

“Grandfather must have 
had some kind of apprehen- 
sion about it,” Paulson said. 
“Just the sight of it is enough 
to scare a man to death. I feel 
as if it were going to gobble 
me up.” 

He turned expectantly to 
Doctor Walter, and the scien- 
tist said nothing. Behind the 
tinted thickness of his face- 
plate, his eyes bulged and 
sparkled. 

“I feel,” Paulson said, “as 
if I were on a disabled ship 
that is likely to crash at any 
second.” 

The scientist took a step 
forward — toward Jupiter. 
“Out, damned spot!” he mut- 
tered. “Out, I say!” 

Paulson jumped, and came 
down slowly. “How was that 
again?” 

“Shakespeare,” the scientist 
said. 

“I said I feel as if I were on 
a disabled ship — ” 

“I heard you. Nonsense. It’s

true that this little moon is 
falling toward Jupiter, but it’s 
only an inch and a fraction a 
year. Fifty million years from 
now, it’ll be a few miles closer. 
Eventually it’ll go all the way, 
but you won’t be around to 
worry about it.” 

“No one will be around to 
worry about it,” Paulson said. 
“Do you think someone down 
there will think it’s another 
bombardment when the moon 
falls, and come up to see who 
did it?” 

Walter said shortly, “I 
wouldn’t know.” 

“You have to admit that 
was a stupid way to experi- 
ment on an unknown planet. 
Atomic warheads !” 

“Who would have imagined 
anything could be living down 
there?” Walter said. 

“But what could they 
learn?” 

“I’m sure they had some 
definite objective. You don’t 
think they did it just for the 
fun of it, do you?” 

Paulson turned. “Your 
hour’s up. Let’s get going.” 
They made long, slow- 
motion bounds across the 
crumbling surface. Suddenly 
Paulson missed Walter, and 
turned to find him motionless, 
staring at Jupiter. 

“You said an hour was all 
you wanted,” Paulson said 
sharply. “We’re jumping off 
at midnight, you know, and I 
only have half the computa- 
tions made.” 



“All right,” Walter said. “I 
was just looking.” 

W HEN they reached the 
tiny lifeship, Walter 
turned again before he enter- 
ed the airlock. “I’d give a lot 
to know what’s down there. 
With all the study that Scien- 
tific Mission put in, they really 
found out nothing about the 
planet.” 

“I can tell you how to man- 
age it,” said Paulson. 

“How?” 

“Give us about a six-months 
start. Then fly down and see 
for yourself. We’ll leave you 
the lifeship.” 

Walter turned abruptly and 
entered the airlock. 

Paulson followed him. 
“Sure, it’s a fascinating 
thing,” he said. “And I’m glad 
the planets in our own solar 
systems run Earth-normal and 
smaller. Otherwise, some sci- 
entist might decide to conduct 
some experiments. I’m glad 
Jupiter is light-years away 
from my home town, but after 
this I’ll never feel easy about 
it. Who can say they won’t 
come out again some day, and 
take to star traveling?” 

They took off, and Paulson 
set course for Callisto Base. A 
moment later Walter got up 
and left the control section. 
When Paulson got curious and 
went back to look for him, he 
found the scientist pressing 
his face against a porthole, 
staring at Jupiter. END
