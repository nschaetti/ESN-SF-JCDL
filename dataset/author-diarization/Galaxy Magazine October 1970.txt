IT DOESN’T TAKE A GENIUS 

to figure out how much you hate miss- 
ing the best story of your favorite writer 
or the major part of a great novel. But 
we can’t compute a formula to stock 
every newsstand in the country with 
enough copies of our popular magazines 
to satisfy every reader. So we some- 
times miss you and you miss us — and 
that’s a double tragedy. 

BUT THERE’S AN ANSWER. 

It doesn’t take a genius to handle it, 
either. All it takes is a minute of your 
time, for which we want to repay you 
with a handsome saving over the news- 
stand price. Just fill in the coupon — 
or write the information on a piece of 
plain paper — and mail it to us. Then 
you’ll be sure instead of sorry.

LETTERS 

This will be in the nature of a 
report to the consumers — the read- 
ers of Galaxy. You. In case you’ve 
ever wondered, your letters have 
impact. And value. 

We hang by them. And some- 
times from them. Like from gal- 
lows. 

Space permitting, I’ll try to cov- 
er your rections to the last six is- 
sues for which reader comments 
are available: February to July. 
Hottest topics were Vaughn 
Bode’s Sunpot, Harlan Ellison’s 
The Region Between and Jack 
Gaughan’s art work — in reverse 
order. And comments on the mag- 
azines in: 

General 

. / heartily congratulate you on 
the fine and consistent quality 
which the magazines under your 
aegis have displayed. I hope you 
can continue to present the discern- 
ing sf reader a magazine group 
worthy of his attention and time. 
The high-quality stories you have 
run recently give me good reason 
to believe that the sf field will con- 
tinue to flourish as a real and per- 
tinent means for extrapolating 
man’s future and through it, a vi- 
able and valid examination of 
man’s present. 

The new repro of the mags has 
shown that Jack Gaughan is one 
of the best artists appearing in the 
sf mags, if not the best. His mind- 
bending, imaginative covers and 
interiors do much to enhance the 
magazines. I hope that it will soon 
become feasible to use other art- 



ists, to allow the Master to devote 
more time to each individual illo. 
Don’t want to overwork him eith- 
er. 

I realize that Galaxy and If are 
having distribution problems. ('If 
has already been cut back to bi- 
monthly; I don’t want the same 
to happen to GALAXY. Hang 
in there, Mr. J., Tm now seeing 
both mags appearing on newstands 
they were absent from for almost 
a year. I am confident the circula- 
tion will again reach (and exceed) 
its former level as more readers 
spread the good word and you're 
seen in the old places again.

. I have an irksome suspicion 
you are drastically abridging Al- 
gis Budrys’ Bookshelf in Galaxy. 
If you are, I know I wouldn't be 
alone in saying that I resent this. 
Mr. Budrys' column is best when 
it's long, when he is developing his 
excellent social comments on the 
field of the books and everything 
else. He's too good to be cut — he 
writes little enough new stuff as it 
is, anyway. 

Don't forsake the Story for the 
Message. Entertainment is still 
the prime quality in a story. 

May I still offer my compli- 
ments? You're O.K.

INTERFACE Crew Nine works 
*in a flat, high strip of gloomy 
space stretching along the outside 
of the service core of Urban Mo- 
nad 116 from the 700th to 730th 
floors. Though the work area is 
lofty, it is scarcely more than five 
meters deep, a skimpy envelope 
through which dust motes dance

the urbmon’s outer layer of resi- 
dential and commercial sectors

core, in which the computers are 
housed. 

The crewmen rarely enter the 
core itself. They function on its 
periphery, keeping watch over the 
looming wall that bears the access 
nodes of the building’s master 




computer nexus. Soft green and 
yellow lights gleam on the nodes,

the workings of the computers. 
Whenever heavy load causes some 
facet of the control system to sag, 
the crewmen quickly prime it so

is vital to the life of the entire gi-

Each day at 1230, when their 
shift begins, Michael Statler and 
his nine crewmates crawl through 
the Edinburgh iris-hatch on 700 
and make their way into the per- 
petual dusk of the interface to 
take up their primer stations. 
Pushchairs carry them to their as- 




signed levels — Michael starts by 
monitoring the nodes spanning 
floors 709 to 712 — and as the day 
progresses they slide up and down 
the interface to the changing zones 
of trouble. 

Michael is twenty-three years 
old. He has been a computer-prim- 
er in this interface crew for eleven 
years. By now the work is purely 
automatic for him; he has become 
simply an extension of the machin- 
ery. Drifting along the interface, 
he boosts or drains, shunts or cou- 
ples, blends or splits, meeting every 
need of the computer he serves, 
and does it all in cool mindless ef- 
ficiency, operating on reflex alone. 
There is nothing reprehensible 
about this. It is not desirable- for a 
primer to think, merely to act and 
act correctly; even here in the fifth 
century of computer technology 
the human brain is still given a 
high rating for its information- 
handling capacity per cubic centi- 
meter, and a properly trained in- 
terface crew is in effect a group of 
ten of these excellent little organi- 
cally-grown computers jacked into 
the main unit. So Michael follows 
the shifting patterns of lights, mak- 
ing all necessary adjustments, and 
the cerebral centers of his mind are 
left free for other things. 

He dreams of all the strange 
places outside Urban Monad 116, 
places that he has seen on the 
screen. He and his wife, Stacion, 
are devoted screen-viewers and 
they rearely miss one of the trave- 



log shows. The portrayals of the 
old pre-urbmon world, of the rel- 
icts, the dusty remnants. Jerusa- 
lem. Istanbul. Rome. The Taj 
Mahal. The stumps of New York. 
The tips of London’s buildings 
above the waves. All the bizarre, 
romantic, alien places beyond the 
urbmon’s skin. Mount Vesuvius. 
The geysers of Yellowstone. The 
African plains. The isles of the 
South Pacific. The Sahara. The 
North Pole. Vienna. Copenhagen. 
Moscow. Angkor Wat. The Great 
Pyramid and the Sphinx. The 
Grand Canyon. Chichen Itza. The 
Amazon jungle. The Great Wall of 
China. 

Do any of these places still ex- 
ist? 

Michael has no idea. A lot of 
what they show on the screen is a 
hundred years old or older. He 
knows that the spread of urbmon 
civilization has required the demo- 
lition of much that is ancient. The 
wiping away of the cluttered past. 
Everything carefully recorded in 
three dimensions first, of course. 
But gone. A puff of white smoke; 
the smell of pulverized stone, dry 
on the nostrils, bitter. Gone. 
Doubtless they’ve saved the fa- 
mous monuments. No need to 
chew up the Pyramids just to make 
room for more urbmons. But the 
big sprawls must have been cleaned 
away. The former cities. After all, 
here we are in the Chipitts con- 
stellation, and he has heard his 
brother-in-law Jason Quevedo, the 



6 



GALAXY 




historian, say that once there were 
two cities called Chicago and Pitts- 
burgh that marked the polar ends 
of the constellation, with a contin- 
uous strip of urban settlement be- 
tween them. Where are Chicago 
and Pittsburgh now? Not a trace 
left, Michael knows; the fifty-one 
towers of the Chipitts constella- 
tion rise along that strip. Every- 
thing neat and organized. We eat 
our past and excrete urbmons. 
Poor Jason; he must miss the an- 
cient world. As do I. As do I. 

M ichael dreams of adventure 
outside Urban Monad 1 16. 

Why not go outside? Must he 
spend all his remaining years hang- 
ing in a pushchair on the interface, 
tickling access nodes? To go out. 
To breathe the strange unfiltered 
air with the smell of green plants 
on it. To see a river. To fly, some- 
how, around this barbered planet, 
looking for the shaggy places. 
Climb the Great Pyramid! Swim 
in an ocean, any ocean! Salt water. 
How curious. Stand under the na- 
ked sky, exposing his skin to the 
dread solar blaze, letting the chilly 
moonlight bathe him. The orange 
glow of Mars. At dawn to blink at 
Venus. 

“Look, I could do it,” he tells 
his wife. Placid bulgy Stacion. 
Carrying their fifth little, a girl, 
coming a few months hence. “It 
wouldn’t be any trouble at all to 
reprime a node so it would give 
me an egress pass. And down the 



shaft and out the building before 
anybody’s the wiser. Running in 
the grass. Traveling cross-country. 
I’d go east. I’d go to New York, 
right by the edge of the sea. They 
didn’t tear down New York — Ja- 
son says so. They just went right 
around it. A monument to the 
troubles.” 

“How would you get food?” 
Stacion asks. A practical girl. 

“I’d live off the land. Wild seeds 
and nuts, like the Indians did. 
Hunt! The heards of bison. Big, 
slow brown things; I’d come up be- 
hind one and jump on its back, 
right up there on the smelly greasy 
hump, and dig my hands into its 
throat, yankl It wouldn’t under- 
stand. No one hunts any more. 
Fall down dead — and I’d have meat 
for weeks. Even eat it raw.” 

“There aren’t any bison, Mich- 
ael. There aren’t any wild animals 
at all. You know that.” 

“Wasn’t serious. Do you think 
I’d really kill? Kill! God bless, I 
may be peculiar but I’m not crazy! 
No. Listen, I’d raid the com- 
munes. Sneak in at night, grab off 
vegetables — a load of protein steak 
— anything that’s loose. Those 
plares aren’t guarded. They don’t 
expect urbmon folk to come 
sneaking around. I’d eat. And I’d 
see New York, Stacion, I’d see 
New York! Maybe even find a 
whole society of wild men there. 
With boats, planes, something to 
take me across the ocean. To Jeru- 
salem! To London! To Africa!” 



THE WORLD OUTSIDE

Stacion laughs. “I love you 
when you start going flippo like 
this,” she says, and pulls him down 
next to her. Rests his throbbing 
head on the smooth taut curve of 
her gravidity. “Do you hear the 
little yet?” Stacion asks. “Is she 
singing in there? God bless, Mich- 
ael, how I love you.” 

She doesn’t take him seriously. 
Who would? But he’ll go. Hanging 
there on the interface, flipping 
switches and palming shunt plates, 
he envisions himself as a world 
traveler. A project: to visit all the 
real cities for which the cities of 
Urbmon 116 were named. As 
many as are left. Warsaw, Reyk- 
javik, Louisville, Colombo, Bos- 
ton, Rome. Tokyo, Toledo, Paris, 
Shanghai, Edinburgh, Nairobi. 
London, Madrid. San Francisco. 
Birmingham. Leningrad. Vienna, 
Seattle, Bombay, Prague. Even 
Chicago and Pittsburgh, unless 
they really are gone. And the oth- 
ers. Did I name them all? He tries 
to count up. Warsaw, Reykjavik, 
Vienna, Colombo. He loses track. 
But anyway. I’ll go out. Even if / 
can’t cover the world. Maybe it’s 
bigger than I imagine it is. But I’ll 
see something. I’ll feel rain on my 
face. Listen to the surf. My toes 
wriggling in cold wet sand. A nd the 
sun! The sun, the sun! Tanning my 
skin! 

No one ever goes out of the urb- 
mon, except perhaps Louisville 
people visiting other urbmons, and 
they don’t go often. Supposedly 



scholars still travel around, visit- 
ing the ancient places, but Michael 
doesn’t know of anyone who has. 
Jason, though he specializes in the 
twentieth century, certainly hasn’t 
gone. He could visit the ruins of 
New York, couldn’t he? Get a 
more vivid feel of what it was like. 
Of course, Jason is Jason, he 
wouldn’t go even if he could. But 
he ought to. I’d go in his place. 
Were we meant to spend all our 
lives inside a single building? He 
has seen some of Jason’s cubes of 
the old days, the open streets, the 
moving cars, the little buildings 
housing only a single family, three 
or four people. Incredibly strange. 
Irresistibly fascinating. Of course, 
it didn’t work; the whole scrambled 
society fell apart. We have to have 
something that’s better organized. 
But Michael understands the pull 
of that kind of life. He feels the 
centrifugal yank toward freedom 
and wants to taste a bit of it. We 
don’t have to live the way they did, 
but we don’t have to live this way, 
either. Not all the time. To go out. 
To experience horizontality. In- 
stead of up and down. Our thou- 
sand floors, our somatic fulfill- 
ment halls, our sonic centers, our 
blessmen, our moral engineers, 
our consolers, our everything. 
There must be more. A short visit 
outside: the supreme sensation of 
my life. I’ll do it. Hanging on the 
interface, serenely nudging his 
nodes downspectrum as the prim- 
ing impulses impinge on his re- 



8 



GALAXY 




flexes, he promises himself that he 
won’t die with his dream unfulfill- 
ed. He’ll go out. Some day. 



H IS brother-in-law Jason has un- 
knowingly fed the fires of Mich- 
ael’s secret yearning. Jason’s the- 
ories about a special race of urb- 
mon people, expressed one night 
when Michael and Stacion were 
visiting the Quevedos — what had 
Jason said? I’m investigating the 
notion that urbmon life is breed- 
ing a new kind of human being. A 
type that adapts readily to rela- 
tively little living space and a low 
privacy quotient. Michael had had 
his doubts about that. That people 
were cooping themselves up in ur- 
ban monads. It didn’t seem like so 
much of a genetic thing to him. 
More like psychological condi- 
tioning. Or even voluntary accept- 
ance of the situation in general. 
But the more Jason spoke, the 
more sense his ideas made. Ex- 
plaining why we don’t go outside 
the urbmons, even though there’s 
no real reason why we can’t. Be- 
cause we recognize that that’s a 
hopeless fantasy. We stay here, 
whether we like it or not. And 
those who don’t like it, those who 
eventually can’t take it — well, you 
know what happens to them. Mich- 
ael knows. Down the chute for the 
flippos. Those who remain adapt 
to circumstances. Two centuries 
of selective breeding, pretty ruth- 
lessly enforced. And all of us so 



well adapted now to this kind of 
life. 

And Michael saying. Ah. Yes. 
All of us so well adapted. Not be- 
lieving it was true about all of us. 

With some exceptions. Jason’s 
mild concession. 

Michael thinks about that, hang- 
ing on the interface. No doubt se- 
lective breeding accounts for a lot 
of it. The universal acceptance of 
urbmon life. Almost universal. 
Everybody takes it for granted that 
this is what life is like, 885,000 
people under the same roof, a 
thousand floors, have lots of lit- 
tles, cuddle up close. Everybody 
accepts. With some exceptions. A 
few of us who look through the 
windows out at the naked world 
and rage and sweat inside our guts. 
Wanting to get out there. Are we 
missing the gene for acceptance? 

If Jason is right, if the urbmon 
population’s been bred to enjoy the 
life it has to lead, then there must 
be a few recessives in the stack. 
Laws of genetics. You can’t eradi- 
cate a gene. You just bury it 
somewhere but it pops up to haunt 
you eight generations along the 
track. Me. In me. I carry the filthy 
thing. And so I suffer. 

Michael decides to confer with 
his sister about these matters. 

He goes to her one morning, 
1100 hours, when he’s fairly sure 
of finding her at home. She is busy 
with the littles. His luscious twin, 
only looking a bit harried just 
now. Her dark hair askew. Her

only garment a dirty towel slung 
over her shoulder. A smudge on 
her cheek. Looking around, sus- 
picious, as he enters. “Oh. You.” 
She smiles at him. How lovely she 
looks, all lean and flat like that. 
Stacion’s breasts are full of milk; 
they swing and joggle, big juicy 
bags. He prefers supple women. 

“Just visiting,” he tells Micaela. 
“Mind if 1 stay a while?” 

“God bless, whatever you like. 
Don’t mind me. The littles are run- 
ning me up the wall.” 

“Can I help you?” But she 
shakes him no. He sits crosslegged, 
watching her run around the room. 
Pop this one under the cleanser, 
that one into the maintenance slot. 
The others off at school, thank 
god. Her legs long and lean, her 
buttocks tight, unpuckered by ex- 
cess flesh. He is half tempted to 
top her, right now, only she’s too 
tense from her morning chores. 
Somehow he hasn’t ever done it, at 
least not in years and years. Not 
since they were children. He put it 
into her then, sure, everybody top- 
ped his sister. Especially since they 
were twins — it was natural to get 
together. A very special closeness, 
like having an extra self, only fe- 
male. Asking each other things. 
She touching him, when they were 
maybe nine. “What does it feel 
like, having all that growing be- 
tween your legs? Dangling. Don’t 
they get in your way when you 
walk?” And he trying to explain. 
Later, when she grew her breasts. 



he asked her the same sort of ques- 
tion. Actually she developed ahead 
of him. Hair on hers long before 
he had any on his. And she was 
bleeding early. That was a kind of 
gulf between them for a while, she 
adult, he still a child, and them 
wombfellows despite it all. Mich- 
ael smiles. “If I ask you some 
things,” he says, “will you promise 
not to tell anyone? Even Jason?” 
“Have I ever been a blabber?” 
“All right. Just making sure.” 
She finishes with the littles and 
sinks down, exhausted, facing him. 
Lets the towel drape itself on her 
thighs. Chastely. He wonders what 
she would think if he asked her to. 
Oh, yes, she’d do it, she’d have to, 
but would she want to? Or be un- 
comfortable about opening it for 
herbrother. She wasn’t, once. But 
that was long ago. 

He says, “Have you ever wanted 
to leave the urbmon, Micaela?” 

“To go to another one, you 
mean?” 

“Just to go out. To the Grand 
Canyon. The Pyramids. Outside. 
Do you ever feel restless inside the 
building?” 

Her dark eyes glitter. “God 
bless, yes! Restless. I never thought 
much about the Pyramids but 
there are days when I feel the walls 
on me like a bunch of hands. Pres- 
sing in.” 

“You, too, then!” 

“What are you talking about, 
Michael?” 

“Jason’s theory. People who’ve 



10 



GALAXY 




bred generation after generation to 
tolerate urbmon existence. And I 
was thinking, some of us aren’t 
like that. We’re recessives. The 
wrong genes.” 

“Throwbacks.” 

“Throwbacks, yes! Like we’re 
out of place in time. We shouldn’t 
have been born now. But when peo- 
ple were free to move around. I 
know I feel that way. Micaela, I 
want to leave the building. Just 
roam around outside.” 

“You aren’t serious.” 

“I think I am. Not that I’ll nec- 
essarily do it. But I want to. And 
that means I’m a, well, a throw- 
back. I don’t fit into Jason’s 
peaceful population. The way Sta- 
cion does. She loves it here. An 
ideal world. But not me. And if 
it’s a genetic thing, if I’m really 
not fit for this civilization, you 
ought to be the same way. You 
having all my genes and me all 
yours. So 1 thought I’d check. To 
understand myself better. Finding 
out how well adjusted you were.” 
“I’m not.” 

“I knew it!” 

“Not that I want to leave the 
building,” Micaela says. “But oth- 
er things. Emotional attitudes. 
Jealousy, ambition. I have a lot of 
unblessworthy stuff in my head, 
Michael. So does Jason. We had a 
fight over it only last week.” She 
chuckles. “And we decided that we 
were throwbacks, the two of us. 
Like savages out of ancient times. 
I don’t want to go into all the de- 



tails — but yes, yes, basically I 
think you’re right, you and I aren’t 
really urbmon people inside. It’s 
just a veneer. We pretend.” 

“Exactly! A veneer!” Michael 
slaps his hands together. “All right. 
It’s what I wanted to know.” 

“You won’t go out of the build- 
ing, will you?” 

“If I do, it’ll just be a short 
while. To see what it’s like. But 
forget I said it.” He detects dis- 
tress in her eyes. Going to her, 
pulling her up into his arms, he 
says, “Don’t mess me up, Mic- 
aela. If I do it, it’ll be because I 
have to. You know me. You un- 
derstand that. So keep quiet until 
I’m back. If I go.” 

H e has no doubts at all now, 
except about some of the peri- 
pheral problems, like saying good- 
bye. Shall he slip out without say- 
ing a word to Stacion? He’d bet- 
ter. She’d never understand and 
she might cause complications. 
And Micaela. He is tempted to 
visit her just before he goes. A 
special farewell. There’s no one 
he’s closer to in the entire building 
and he might just not return from 
his outbuilding jaunt. He thinks 
he’d like to top her and he sus- 
pects she wants him. A loving fare- 
well, just in case. But can he risk 
it? He mustn’t place too much 
faith in this genetic thing — if she 
finds out that he’s actually plan- 
ning to leave the urbmon, she 
might just have him picked up and

sent to the moral engineers. For 
his own sake. No doubt she con- 
siders his project a flippo idea. 
Weighing everything, Michael de- 
cides not to say anything to her. 
He will top her in his mind. Her 
lips to his, her tongue busy, his 
hands stroking her springy firm- 
ness. The thrust. Their bodies 
moving in perfect coordination. 
We are only the sundered halves of 
a single entity, now joined once 
more. For this brief moment. It 
becomes so vivid in his imagina- 
tion that he nearly abandons his 
resolution. Nearly. 

But in the end he goes without 
telling anyone. 

Done rather easily. He knows 
how to make the great machine 
serve his needs. On his regular 
shift that day he stays a little wider 
awake than usual, dreams a little 
less. Monitoring his nodes, riding 
gain on all the fugitive impulses 
floating, through the giant build- 
ing’s mighty ganglia: food requisi- 
tions, birth and death statistics, 
atmospheric reports, a sonic cen- 
ter’s amplification level, the re- 
plenishment of groovers in the me- 
chanical dispensers, the urine-re- 
cycling figures, communications 
links, et cetera cetera cetera. And 
as he makes his adjustments he 
casually fingers a node and obtains 
a plug-in to the data reservoir. 
Now he is in direct contact with 
the central brain, the big machine. 
It flashes him a string of brassy 
spurts of golden light: telling him 



that it is ready to accept reprim- 
ing. Very well. He instructs it to 
issue one egress pass for Michael 
Statler of apartment 70411, ob- 
tainable by the said Statler on de- 
mand at any terminal and valid 
until used. Seeing the possibilities 
for cowardice in that, he amends 
the order immediately: valid only 
for twelve hours after issuance. 
Plus ingress privileges whenever 
requested. The node flashes him 
on acceptance symbol. Good. Now 
he records two messages, noting 
them down for delivery fifteen 

ours after the issuance of the 
egress pass. To Mrs. Micaela Que- 
vedo, apartment 76124. Dear Sis- 
ter, I did it, wish me luck. Fll bring 
you some sand from the seashore. 
And the other message to Mrs. 
Stacion Statler, Apartment 70411. 
Explaining briefly where he has 
gone and why. Telling her he’ll be 
back soon, not to worry, this is 
something he has to do. So much 
for farewells. 

He finishes his shift. Now it is 
1730. It makes no sense to leave 
the building with night coming on. 
He returns to Stacion; they have 
dinner, he plays with the littles, 
they watch the screen a while, they 
make love. Maybe the last time. 
She says, “You seem very with- 
drawn tonight, Michael.” 

“Tired. A lot of shunting on the 
wall today.” 

She dozes. He cuddles her in 
his arms. Soft and warm and big, 
getting bigger every second. The

cells dividing in her belly, the mag- 
ical mitosis. God bless! He is al- 
most unable to bear the idea of 
going away from her. But then the 
screen blazes with images of lands 
afar. The isle of Capri at sunset, 
gray sky, gray sea, horizon meet- 
ing the zenith, roads winding along 
a cliff overgrown with lush green- 
ery. Here the villa of the Emperor 
Tiberius. Farmers and shep- 
herds here, living as they did ten 
thousand years ago, untouched by 
the changes in the mainland world. 
No urbmons here. Lovers rolling 
in the grass, if they want. Pull up 
her skirt. Laughter; the thorns of 
berry-laden vines scratching the 
pink acreage of her buttocks but 
she doesn’t mind. Hearty hot- 
slotted peasant wench. An example 
of obsolete barbarism. You and 
she get dirty together, soil between 
your toes and ground into the skin 
of your knees. And look here, 
these men in ragged grimy clothes, 
they’re passing a flask of golden 
wine around, right in the fields 
where the grapes are grown. How 
dark their skins are! Like leather, 
if that’s what leather really looked 
like — how can you be sure? Brown, 
tough. Tanned by the authentic 
sun. Far below the waves roll gent- 
ly in. Grottoes and fantastic sculp- 
tured rocks by the edge of the sea. 
The sun is gone behind the clouds 
and the grayness of sky and shore 
deepens. A fine mist of rain comes. 
Night. Birds singing their hymns 
to the coming of darkness. Goats

IT JUST so happens that these bi- 
monthly issues occur at a time when 
we could use a lot more space, dam- 
mit, to talk about books— as a change 
from our environment which, howev- 
er, has not gone away. Yet. Self-pres- 
ervation comes first, so: In August 
we are meant to publish (and most 
certainly will as soon as the author 
surfaces from under his test tubes) 
THE USER'S GUIDE TO THE PRO- 
TECTION OF THE ENVIRON- 
MENT. Our titles grow more un- 
wieldy as we go along, and the books 
progressively more activist. This is 
the one that tells what products to buy 
and what not. Along with it, of course, 
THE ENVIRONMENTAL LAW 
HANDBOOK. Someone in editorial 
was thinking cool. For nostalgic pur- 
poses (or Style Of Life), try A SAND 
COUNTY almanac. For ohmigod, 
what's that, THE ALIEN ANIMALS 
—which has nothing whatever to do 
with bems. And so to s.f .

AUGUST sees two adult fantasies— 
our very first original work, DERYNI 
RISING, by Katherine Kurtz; the De- 
ryni being an extra-human race of 
sorcerors and necromancers; fhe set- 
ting, somewhen around the western 
marches of pre-Albion. A bouncing, 
bounding story, solid characteriza- 
tion and a logical conflict of power.

Really a remarkable first. Great 
stuff, luckily the first in a proposed 
trilogy. Hopefully, we'll be doing one 
a year. This month also— the first vol- 
ume of William Morris' classic mas- 
terwork, THE WELL AT THE 
WORLD'S END. (September sees 
the second volume. Watch for it. You 
really have to be a hawk if you're buy- 
ing off the stands— a worthy reason, 
for once.) Morris, in the opinion of a 
few, is an acquired taste. We find his 
lyrical, simple prose altogether en- 
chanting. Not that he writes in ro- 
mantic pastels. Indeed, THE WELL 
is often harsh; it is fantasy by virtue 
of the fact that Morris, because he be- 
lieved in the rightness of it, created a 
world that was simpler, closer to the 
Earth, stronger than the burgeoning 

industrialization of his own cenfury.

IN SEPTEMBER we are celebrating 
Bob Silverberg's Heicon honors by 
reissuing his NEEDLE IN A TIME- 
STACK, TO OPEN THE SKY and 
THORNS— and publishing the first of 
fhe ALPHA series, which the Pope is 
editing for us. And James White's 
HOSPITAL STATION, STAR SUR- 
GEON and DEADLY LITTER will 
once again be available, along with 
our paperbound ALL JUDGMENT 
FLED. For you Tolkien fans— a NEW

ine what it would be like for authors 
if we could get $2. 50 for books. BB 



settling down. He walks the leafy 
paths, avoiding the hot shining 
turds, pausing to touch the rough 
bark of this tree to taste the sweet- 
ness of this swollen berry. He can 
almost smell the salt spray from 
below. Sees himself running along 
the beach at dawn with Micaela, 
both of them naked, the nightfog 
lifting, the first crimson light 
splashing their pale skins. The wa- 
ter all golden. They leap in, swim, 
float, the salty water giving them 
buoyancy. They dive and paddle 
underwater, eyes open, studying 
each other. Her hair streaming out 
behind her. A trail of bubbles pur- 
suing her kicking feet. He catches 
up with her and they embrace far 
from shore. Friendly dolphins 
watching them. They engender an 
incestuous little while coupling in 
the famous Mediterranean. Where 
Apollo nailed his sister, didn’t he? 
Or was that another god. Classical 
echoes all around. Textures, tastes, 
the chilly bite of the dawn breeze 
as they drag themselves up on 
shore, the sand sticking to their 
wet skins, a bit of seaweed tangled 
in her hair. A boy with a baby goat 
coming toward them. Vino? Vino? 
Holding out a flask. Smiling. Mic- 
aela petting the goat. The boy ad- 
miring her slender naked body. Si, 
you say, vino, but of course you 
have no money, and you try to ex- 
plain, but the boy doesn’t care 
about that. He gives you the flask. 
You drink deep. Cold wine, alive, 
tingling. The boy looks at Micaela.

GALAXY 




Un bacio? Why not, you think. No 
harm in it. Si, si, un bacio, you 
say, and the boy goes to Micaela, 
puts his lips shyly to hers, reaches 
up as though to touch her breasts, 
then does not dare to, and just 
kisses. And pulls away, grinning, 
and goes to you and kisses you 
too, quickly, and then runs, he and 
his goat, madly down the beach, 
leaving you with the flask of wine. 
You pass it to Micaela. The wine 
dribbling past her chin, leaving 
bright beads in the brightening sun- 
light. When the wine is gone you 
hurl the flask far out to sea. A gift 
for the mermaids. You take Mi- 
caela’s hand. Up the cliff, through 
the brambles, pebbles turning be- 
neath your bare feet. Textures, 
changes of temperature, scents, 
sounds. Birds. Laughter. The glo- 
rious isle of Capri. The boy with 
the goat is just ahead, waving to 
you from beyond a ravine, telling 
you to hurry, hurry, come and see. 
The screen goes dark. You are ly- 
ing on the sleeping platform beside 
your drowsy pregnant wife on the 
704th floor of Urban Monad 1 16. 

He must leave. He must leave. 

He gets up. Stacion stirs. 
“Shh,” he says. “Sleep.” 

“Going nightwalking?” 

“I think so,” he says. Strips, 
stands under the cleanser. Then 
puts on a fresh tunic, sandals, his 
most durable clothes. What else 
shall he take? He has nothing. He 
will go like this. 

Kisses Stacion. Un bacio. An- 



cora un bacio. The last one, per- 
haps. Hand resting lightly on her 
belly a moment. She’ll get his mes- 
sage in the morning. Goodbye, 
goodbye. To the sleeping littles. 
He goes out. Looks upward as if 
seeing through the intervening fif- 
ty-odd floors. Goodbye, Micaela. 
Love. It is 0230 hours. Still long 
before dawn. He will move slowly. 
Pausing, he studies the walls about 
him, the metallic-looking dark 
plastic with the warmth of burn- 
ished bronze. A sturdy building, 
well designed. Rivers of unseen 
cables snaking through the service 
core. And that huge, watchful man- 
made mind in the middle of every- 
thing. So easily deceived. Michael 
finds a terminal in the corridor and 
identifies himself. Michael Statler, 
70411. One egress pass, please. Of 
course, sir. Here you are. From the 
slot a gleaming blue circlet for his 
wrist. Slips it on. Takes the drop- 
shaft down. Gets off at 580 for no 
particular reason. Boston. Well, 
he has time to kill. Like a visitor 
from Venus he wanders the hall, 
occasionally meeting a sleepy 
nightwalker on his way home. As 
is his privilege, he opens a few 
doors, peers in at the people with- 
in, some awake, most not. A girl 
invites him to share her platform. 
He shakes his head. “Just passing 
through,” he says, and goes to the 
dropshaft. Down to 375. San Fran- 
cisco. The artists live here. He can 
hear music. Michael has always 
envied the San Franciscans. They 



THE WORLD OUTSIDE 



15 




have purpose in life. They have 
their art. He opens doors here, 
too. 

“Come on,” he wants to say, “I 
have an egress pass, Tm going out- 
side! Come with me, all of you!” 
Sculptors, poets, musicians, dra- 
matists. He will be the pied piper. 
But he is not sure his pass will get 
more than one out of the building, 
and he says nothing. Down, in- 
stead. Birmingham. Pittsburgh, 
where Jason toils to rescue the 
past, which is beyond rescue. Tok- 
yo. Prague. Warsaw. Reykjavik. 
The whole vast building is sitting 
on his back now. A thousand 
floors, 885, 000 people. A dozen 
littles are being born as he stands 
here. A dozen more are being con- 
ceived. Maybe someone is dying. 
And one man is escaping. Shall he 
say goodbye to the computer? Its 
tubes and coils, its liquid-filled 
guts, its tons of skeleton. A mil- 
lion eyes everywhere in the city. 
Eyes watching him, but it’s all 
right, he has a pass. 

First floor. All out. 

This is so easy. But where is the 
exit? ThW. Just a tiny hatch. But 
he was expecting a grand lobby, 
onyx floors, alabaster pillars, 
bright lights, polished brass, a shin- 
ing swinging glass door. Of course 
no one important ever uses this 
exit. High dignitaries travel by 
quickboat, arriving and departing 
at the landing stage on the thou- 
sandth floor. And the courier pods 
of farm produce from the com- 



munes enter the urbmon far be- 
lowground. Perhaps years at a time 
go by between each traversal of 
the first-floor opening. Yet he will. 
How shall he do it? Holds his 
egress pass up, hoping there are 
scanners nearby. Yes. A red light 
blazes above the hatch. And it 
opens. It opens. He goes forward, 
finding himself in a long, cool tun- 
nel, poorly lit. The hatch door 
closing behind him. Yes, well, pre- 
venting contamination by outside 
air, he supposes. He waits, and a 
second door opens in front of him, 
creaking a little. Michael sees 
nothing beyond, only darkness, but 
he roes through the door, and feels 
steps, seven or eight of them, and 
descends them, coming unexpect- 
edly to the last. Bump. And then 
the ground. Strangely spongy, 
strangely yielding. Earth. Soil. 
Dirt. He is outside. 

He is outside. 

II 

H e feels somewhat like the 
first man to walk on the moon. 
A faltering step not knowing what 
to expect. So many unfamiliar 
sensations to absorb at once. The 
hatch closing behind him. On his 
own, then. But unafraid. I must 
concentrate on one thing at a time. 
The air, first. He pulls it deep into 
his throat. Yes, it has a different 
taste, sweeter, more alive, a natur- 
al taste; the air seems to expand as 
he breathes it, seeking out the folds 



16 



GALAXY 




and byways of his lungs. In a min- 
ute, though, he can no longer iso- 
late the factors of novelty in it. It 
is simply air, neutral, familiar. As 
if he has breathed it all his life. 
Will it fill him with deadly bacter- 
ia? He comes from an aseptic seal- 
ed environment, after all. Lying 
puffed and discolored on the 
ground in final agonies an hour 
from now, maybe. Or strange pol- 
len borne by the breeze, sprouting 
in his nostrils. Choked by massing 
fungi. Forget the air. He looks up. 

Dawn is still more than an hour 
away. The sky is blue-black; there 
are stars everywhere and a cres- 
cent moon is high. From the win- 
dows of the urbmon he has seen 
the heavens, but never like this. 
Head back, legs flung wide, arms 
outstretched. Embracing the star- 
light. A billion icy lances striking 
my body. He is tempted to strip 
and lie naked in the night until he 
is starburned, moonburned. Smil- 
ing, he takes another ten steps 
away from the urbmon. Glancing 
back then. A pillar of salt. Three 
kilometers high. It hangs in the air 
like a toppling mass, terrifying 
him; he begins to count the floors 
but the effort dizzies him and he 
gives up before the fiftieth. At this 
angle most of the building is in- 
visible to him, rising so steeply 
over his head, yet what he sees is 
enough. Its bulk threatens to crush 
him. He moves away, into the 
gardened plaza. The frightening 
mass of a nearby urbmon looms in 



front of him, at a distance suffi- 
cient to give him a truer picture of 
its size. Jabbing the stars, almost. 
So much, so much! All those win- 
dows. And behind them 850,000 
people or more whom he has nev- 
er met. Littles, nightwalkers, com- 
puter-primers, consolers, wives, 
mothers, a whole world up there. 
Dead. Dead. He looks to his left. 
Another urbmon, shrouded in the 
mists of coming day. To his right. 
Another. He brings his gaze down, 
closer to earth. The garden. For- 
mal pathways. This is grass. 
Kneels, breaks off a blade, feels 
instant remorse as he cradles the 
green shaft in his cupped hands. 
Killer. He puts the grass in his 
mouth; not much taste. He had 
thought it might be sweet. This is 
soil. Digs his fingertips in. Black- 
ness under his nails. Draws a 
grooved row through a flowerbed. 
Sniffs a yellow globe of petals. 
Looks up a tree. Hand against the 
bark. 

A robot gardener is moving 
through the plaza, pruning things, 
fertilizing things. It swings around 
on its heavy black base and peers 
at him. Interrogative. Michael 
holds up his wrist and lets the gar- 
dener scan his egress pass. It looses 
interest in him. 

Now he is far from Urbmon 
116. Again he turns and studies it, 
seeing its full height at last. In- 
distinguishable from 117 and 115. 
He shrugs and follows a path that 
takes him out of the line in which 



THE WORLD OUTSIDE 



17 





the row of urbmons is set. A pool; 
he crouches beside it, dipping his 
hand in. Then puts his face to its 
surface and drinks. Splashes the 
water gaily. Dawn has begun to 
stain the sky. The stars are gone, 
the moon is going. Hastily he 
strips. Slowly into the pool, hissing 
when the water reaches his loins. 
Swims carefully, putting his feet 
down now and then to feel the cold 



muddy floor, at last coming to a 
place where he no longer can touch 
bottom. Birds singing. This is the 
first morning of the world. Pale 
light slides across the silent sky. 
After a while he comes out of the 
water and stands dripping and na- 
ked by the edge of the pool, shiv- 
ering a little, listening to the birds, 
watching the red disk of the sun 
climbing out of the east. Gradually

he becomes aware that he is crying. 
The beauty of it. The solitude. He 
is alone at time’s first dawn. To 
be naked is right. I am Adam. He 
touches his genitals. Looking off 
afar, he sees three urbmons glow- 
ing with pearly light and wonders 
which is 116. Stacion in there, and 
Micaela. If only she were with me 
now. Both of us naked by this 
pool. While the snake watches 



from the tree. He laughs. God 
bless! He is alone and not fright- 
ened at all by it, no one within 
sight and he loves it, though he 
misses Micaela, Stacion, both, 
each. Trembling. Hard with desire. 
Dropping to the moist black earth 
beside the pool. Still crying a little, 
hot teardrops trickling down his 
face occasionally. He watches the 
sky turn blue and puts his hand on

himself and bites his lip. He sum- 
mons his vision of the beach at 
Capri, the wine, the boy, the goat, 
the kisses, Micaela, the two of 
them bare at dawn, and he gasps as 
his seed spurts. Fertilizing the na- 
ked earth. Two hundred million 
unborn littles in that sticky pud- 
dle. He swims again; then he be- 
gins to walk once more, carrying 
his clothes over his arm. After 
perhaps an hour he puts them on, 
fearing the kiss of the soaring sun 
on his tender indoor hide. 



B y noon plazas and pools and 
formal gardens are far behind 
and he has entered the outlying 
territory of one of the agricultural 
communes. The world is wide and 
flat here and the distant urbmons 
are glossy brown spikes on the ho- 
rizon, receding to east and west. 
There are no trees. No unruly wild 
vegetation at all, in fact, none of 
the chaotic tumble of greenery 
that was so appealing in that tour 
of Capri. Michael sees long aisles 
of low plants, separated by strips 
of bare dark soil, and here and 
there an entire tremendous field 
totally empty, as if awaiting seed. 
These must be the vegetable fields. 
He inspects the plants: thousands 
of something spherical and coiled, 
clutching itself to itself, and thou- 
sands of something vertical and 
grassy, with dangling tassels, and 
thousands of another kind — and 
another and another. As he walks 



along the crops keep changing. Is 
this corn? Beans? Squash? Car- 
rots? Wheat? He has no way of 
matching the product to its source. 
His childhood geography lessons 
have faded and run; all he can do 
is guess and probably guess badly. 
He breaks leaves from this and 
this and this. He tastes shoots and 
pods. Sandals in hand, he walks 
barefoot through the voluptuous 
turned-up clods of earth. 

He thinks he is heading east. 
Going toward the place where the 
sun came from. But now that the 
sun is high overhead it is hard to 
determine directions. The dwin- 
dling row of urbmons is no help. 
How far is it to the sea? At the 
thought of a beach his eyes grow 
damp. The heaving surf. The taste 
of salt. A thousand kilometers? 
How far is that? He works out an 
analogy. Lay an urbmon on end, 
then put another one at its tip and 
another one beyond that. It will 
take 333 urbmons, end to end, to 
reach from here to the sea if I am 
a thousand kilometers from the 
sea now. His heart sinks. He has 
no real idea of distances. It might 
be ten thousand kilometers. He 
imagines what it would be like to 
walk from Reykjavik to Louis- 
ville 333 times, even horizontally. 
But with patience he can do it. If 
only he can find something to eat. 
These leaves, these stalks, these 
pods, do him no good. Which part 
of the plant is edible, anyway? 
Must he cook it? How? This jour- 



20 



GALAXY 




ney will be more complex than he 
imagined. But his alternative is to 
scurry back to the urbmon and he 
will not do that. It would be like 
dying, never having lived. He goes 
on. 

Tiring. A little lightheaded from 
hunger, since he’s been on the trek 
six or seven hours now. Physical 
fatigue, too. This horizontal walk- 
ing must use different muscles. 
Going up and down stairs is easy. 
Riding dropshafts and liftshafts is 
easier still — the short horizontal 
walks along the corridors have not 
prepared him for this. The ache in 
the backs of the thighs. The raw- 
ness in the ankles, as of bone grat- 
ing against bone. The shoulders 
struggling to keep the head held 
high. Scrambling over this irregu- 
lar earthy surface multiplies the 
problem. He rests a while. Soon 
afterward he comes to a stream, a 
sort of ditch cutting across the 
fields. He drinks, then strips and 
bathes. The cool water refreshes 
him. He goes on, stopping three 
times to sample the unripened 
crops. Suppose you get too far 
from the urbmon to get back, if 
you begin starving? Struggling 
through these fields as strength 
leaves you, trying to drag your- 
self across the kilometers toward 
the far-off tower. Dying of hun- 
ger amidst all this green plenty. 
No. He’ll manage. 

Being alone starts to upset him, 
too. Something of a surprise, that. 
In the urbmon he frequently was 



irritated by the sheer surging mul- 
tiplicitous masses. Littles under- 
foot everywhere, clots of women 
in the halls, that kind of thing. 
Relishing, in a distinctly unbless- 
worthy way, the daily hours on the 
interface, in the dimness, no one 
around him except his nine crew- 
mates and they far away, minding 
their own nodes. For years cher- 
ishing this vision of escaping into 
privacy, his cruel retrogressive 
fantasy of solitude. Now he has it 
and at the beginning he wept for 
sheer joy of it. But by afternoon 
it does not seem so charming. He 
finds himself darting little hopeful 
glances to the periphery of his 
sight, as if he might pick up the 
aura of a passing human being. 
Perhaps if Micaela had come with 
him it would be better. Adam, 
Eve. But of course she wouldn’t 
have. Only his fraternal twin — not 
precisely the same genes. She’s 
restless but she’d never have done 
anything as wild as this. He pic- 
tures her trudging beside him. 
Yes. Stopping now and then to top 
her in the green crops. But the 
aloneness is getting him. 

He shouts. Calls his name. Mi- 
caela’s, Stacion’s. Cries out the 
names of his fifties. “I am a citi- 
zen of Edinburgh!” he bellows. 
“Urban Monad 116! The 704th 
floor!” The sounds float away to- 
ward the fleecy clouds. How love- 
ly the sky is now, blue and gold 
and white. 

A sudden droning sound out of

the — north? Growing louder mo- 
ment by moment. Harsh, throb- 
bing, raucous. Has he brought 
some monster upon himself by his 
noise? Shading his eyes. There it 
is: a long black tube soaring slow- 
ly toward him at a height of, oh, 
maybe a hundred meters at most. 
Throws himself to the ground, 
huddles between the rows of cab- 
bages or turnips or whatever. The 



black thing has a dozen stubby 
nozzles protruding along its sides. 
From each nozzle spurts a cloudy 
green mist. Michael understands. 
Spraying the crops, probably. A 
poison to kill insects and other 
pests. What will it do to me? He 
coils, knees to his chest, hands to 
his face, eyes closed, mouth bur- 
ied in palm. That terrible roaring 
overhead; kill me with decibels if 



not with your filthy spray. The in- 
tensity of the sound diminishes. 
The thing is past him. The pesti- 
cide is drifting down, he supposes, 
trying not to breathe. Lips 
clamped. Fiery petals dropping 
from heaven. Flowers of death. 
There it is now, a faint dampness 
on his cheeks, a clinging moist 
veil. How soon will it kill him? He 
counts the passing minutes. Still 



alive. The flying thing no longer in 
earshot. Cautiously he opens his 
eyes and stands up. Perhaps no 
danger, then — but he runs through 
the fields toward the glittering rib- 
bon of a nearby creek and plunges 
in, peeling in panic, to scrub him- 
self. And only coming out real- 
izes the creek must have been 
sprayed too. Well, he’s not dead 
yet, anyway.

How far is it to the nearest 
commune? 



S OMEHOW, in their infinite 
wisdom, the planners of this 
farm have allowed one low hill to 
survive. Mounting it in mid-after- 
noon, Michael takes stock. There 
are the urbmons, curiously dwin- 
dled. There are the cultivated 
fields. He sees machines now, 
moving in some of the rows, 
things with many arms, possibly 
pulling up weeds. No sign of a set- 
tlement, though. He descends the 
hill and shortly encounters one of 
the agricultural machines. The 
first company he’s had all day. 
“Hello. Michael Statler, from 
Urbmon One-sixteen. What’s your 
name, machine? What kind of 
work do you do?” 

Baleful yellow eyes study him 
and turn away. The machine is 
loosening the soil at the base of 
each plant in the row. Squirting 
something milky over the roots. 
Unfriendly filther, aren’t you? Or 
just not programed to talk. “I 
don’t mind,” he says. “Silence is 
golden. If you could just tell me 
where I could get a little to eat, 
though. Or find some people.” 
Droning sound again. Crot! An- 
other stinking crop-sprayer! He 
gets down, ready to curl up again 
— but no, this flying thing is not 
spraying, nor does it go past. Hov- 
ering overhead, it swings into a 
tight circle, making an infernal 



holocaust of noise. A hatch opens 
in its belly. Out drops a double 
strand of fine golden fiber, reach- 
ing to the ground. Down it, riding 
a clip-pod, slides a human being, a 
woman, followed by a man. They 
land deftly and come toward him. 
Grim faces. Beady eyes. Weapons 
at their waists. Their only gar- 
ments are glossy red wraps cover- 
ing them from thigh to belly. 
Their skins are tanned; their bod- 
ies are lean. The man has a stiff, 
bushy black beard: incredible, gro- 
tesque facial hair! The woman’s 
breasts are small and hard. Both 
of them drawing their weapons 
now. “Hello!” Michael calls 
hoarsely. “I’m from an urbmon! 
Just visiting your country. Friend! 
Friend! Friend!” 

The woman says something un- 
intelligible. 

He shrugs. “Sorry, I don’t un- 
der — ” 

The weapon poking in his ribs. 
How cold her face is! The eyes 
like icy buttons. Will they kill 
him? Now the man speaks. Slowly 
and clearly, very loudly, as one 
would speak to a three-year-old. 
Every syllable an alien one. Ac- 
cusing him of trespassing in the 
fields, probably. One of the farm- 
ing machines must have reported 
him to the commune. Michael 
points; the urbmons can still be 
seen from here. Indicates them, 
taps his chest. For whatever good 
that will do. They must know 
where he’s from. His captors nod.

GALAXY 




unsmiling. A frosty pair. Arrested. 
Intruder menacing the sanctity of 
the fields. Woman takes him by 
the elbow. Well, at least they 
aren’t going to kill him outright. 
The devilish noisy flying thing still 
racketing overhead in its narrow 
orbit. They guide him toward the 
dangling fiber strands. The woman 
is in the clip-pod, now. Goes up. 
Then the man tells Michael some- 
thing which he suspects means, 
“Now you.” Michael smiles. Co- 
operation his only hope. Figures 
out how to get into the clip-pod; 
the man makes the adjustments, 
locking him in, and up he goes. 
The woman, waiting above, de- 
pods him and pushes him into a 
webwork cradle. Keeps her wea- 
pon ready. A moment later the 
man is aboard too; the hatch 
closes and the flying machine goes 
roaring off. During the flight both 
of them interrogate him, hurling 
little jabbing bursts of words at 
him, but he can only reply apolo- 
getically, “I don’t speak your lan- 
guage. How can I tell you what 
you want to know?” 

Minutes later the machine 
lands. They jostle him out onto a 
bare reddish-brown field. Along its 
rim he sees low flat-roofed brick 
buildings, curious snub-fronted 
gray vehicles, several many-armed 
farming machines and dozens of 
men and women wearing the glos- 
sy red loincloths. Not many chil- 
dren. Perhaps they’re at school, al- 
though it’s getting late in the day. 



Everyone pointing at him. Speak- 
ing rapidly. Harsh, unintelligible 
comments. Some laughter. He is 
frightened somewhat, not by the 
possibility of peril as much as by 
the strangeness of everything. He 
knows this must be an agricultural 
commune. All this day’s walking 
was prelude; he now has truly 
passed over from one world to an- 
other. 



T he man and woman who cap- 
tured him push him across the 
bare field and through the crowd 
of farming folk into one of the 
buildings nearby. The farmers fin- 
ger his clothing as he passes, touch 
his bare arms and face, murmur 
softly. Wonderstruck. Like a man 
from Mars in their midst. The 
building is poorly lit, roughly con- 
structed, with crooked walls, low 
ceilings, warped floors of some 
pale pocked plastic material. He 
is dumped into a bare, dismal 
room. A sour smell pervades it — 
vomit? Before she leaves him the 
woman points out the facilities 
with a few brusque gestures. A 
basin of some white artificial sub- 
stance with the texture of smooth 
stone, yellowing and cracked in 
places. There is no sleeping plat- 
form, but probably he is meant to 
use the heap of rumpled blankets 
against one wall. No sign of a 
cleanser. For excretion he has a 
single unit, nothing more than a 
kind of plastic funnel going into 



THE WORLDOUTSIDE

the floor, with a button to push 
when he wishes to clear it. Evi- 
dently it is for urine and feces 
both. An odd arrangement — but 
then he realizes they wouldn’t need 
to recycle wastes here. The room 
has no source of artificial light. 
Through its one window streams 
the last feeble sun of the after- 
noon. The window faces the plaza 
where the farmers still are gath- 
ered, discussing him; he sees them 
pointing, nodding, nudging each 
other. There are metal bars on the 
window, set too close together to 
permit a man to slip through. A 
prison cell, then. He checks the 
door. Locked. How friendly of 
them. He’ll never reach the sea- 
coast this way. 

“Listen,” he calls to those in the 
plaza, “I don’t mean any harm! 
You don’t need to lock me up!” 

They laugh. Two young men 
stroll over and stare solemnly at 
him. One of them puts his hand to 
his mouth and painstakingly cov- 
ers his entire palm with saliva; 
when this is done he offers the 
palm to his companion, who 
presses his hand against it. Both 
break into wild laughter. Michael 
watches, mystified. He has heard 
about the barbaric customs in the 
communes. Primitive, incompre- 
hensible. The young men say 
something contemptuous-sound- 
ing to him and walk away. A girl 
takes their place by his window. 
Fifteen, sixteen years old, he 
guesses. Her breasts are large and 



deeply tanned and between them 
hangs an explicit phallic amulet. 
She fondles it in what strikes him 
as lascivious invitation. “I’d love 
to,” he says. “If you can only get 
me out of here.” He puts his 
hands through the bars as if to ca- 
ress her. She leaps back wild-eyed 
and makes a fierce gesture, jab- 
bing her left hand at him with the 
thumb clenched under and the oth- 
er four fingers aimed at his face. 
Clearly an obscenity. As she goes, 
some older people come to stare. 
A woman taps her chin in slow, 
steady, apparently meaningful 
rhythm; a withered man soberly 
presses his left palm to his right 
elbow three times; another man 
stoops, puts his hands on the 
ground and rises, lifting them far 
above his head, perhaps pantomim- 
ing the growth of a lofty plant, 
perhaps the construction of an ur- 
ban monad. Whatever, he breaks 
into shrill laughter and stumbles 
off. Night is coming, now. 
Through the dusk Michael sees a 
succession of crop-spraying ma- 
chines landing in the plaza like 
birds returning to the nest at sun- 
down. Dozens of many-legged mo- 
bile farming units come striding 
from the fields. The onlookers 
vanish; he watches them going into 
the other buildings around the pla- 
za. Despite the uncertainties of be- 
ing a prisoner, he is captivated by 
the alien nature of this place. To 
live so close to the ground, to 
walk about all day long under the

naked sun, to know nothing of an 
urbmon’s crowded richness — 

An armed girl brings him din- 
ner, popping his door open, setting 
down a tray, leaving without a 
word. Stewed vegetables, a clear 
broth, some unfamiliar red fruits 
and a capsule of cold wine: the 
fruits are bruised and, to his taste, 
overripe, but everything else is ex- 
cellent. He eats greedily, cleaning 
the tray. Then he goes to the win- 
dow. The center of the plaza is 
still empty, although at the far 
side eight or ten men, evidently a 
maintenance crew, have gone to 
work on the farming machines by 
the light of three floating lumi- 
nous globes. His cell now is in 
complete darkness. Since there is 
nothing else to do he removes his 
clothes and sprawls out on the 
blankets. Though he is exhausted 
by his long day’s trek, sleep will 
not come at first: his mind ticks 
furiously, contemplating options. 
Doubtless they will interrogate 
him tomorrow. Someone around 
here must know the language of 
the urbmons. With luck he can 
demonstrate that he means no 
harm. Smile a lot, act friendly, 
show an air of innocence. Perhaps 
even get them to escort him out of 
their territory. Fly him eastward, 
dump him in some other com- 
mune’s land, let him make his way 
to the sea. Will he be arrested at 
commune after commune? A 
dreary prospect. Maybe he can 
find a route that bypasses the agri- 



cultural zone — through the ruins 
of some former cities, possibly. 
Unless there are wild men living 
there. At least the farmers are civ- 
ilized in their fashion. He envi- 
sions himself cooked by cannibals 
in some blasted rubbleheap, the 
former Pittsburgh, say. Or just 
eaten raw. Why are the farmers so 
suspicious? What can one lone 
wanderer do to them? The natural 
xenophobia of an isolated culture, 
he decides. Just as we wouldn’t 
want a farmer loose in an urbmon. 
But of course urbmons are closed 
systems. Everybody numbered, in- 
oculated, assigned to a proper 
place. These folk have a less rigid 
system, don’t they? They don’t 
need to fear strangers. Try con- 
vincing them of that. 

He drifts into an uneasy sleep. 

H e is awakened, not more than 
an hour or two later, by discor- 
dant music, raw and disturbing. 
Sits up: red shadows flickering on 
the wall of his cell. Some kind of 
visual projections? Or a fire out- 
side? Rushes to the window. Yes. 
An immense mound of dried 
stems, branches, vegetable debris 
of all sorts, is ablaze in the middle 
of the plaza. He has never seen fire 
before, except sometimes on the 
screen, and the sight of it terrifies 
and delights him. Those wavering 
bursts of redness rising and vanish- 
ing — where do they go? And he 
can feel the surging heat even from 
where he stands. The constant flux. 



THE WORLDOUTSIDE

the shifting shape of the dancing 
flames — how incredibly beautiful! 
And menacing. Aren’t they afraid, 
letting fire loose like this? But of 
course there’s that zone of bare 
dirt around it. Fire can’t cross 
that. The earth doesn’t burn. 

He forces his eyes away from 
the hypnotic frenzy of the fire. A 
dozen musicians sit close together 
to the left of the blaze. The instru- 
ments weirdly medieval. Every- 
thing is operated by blowing or 
pounding or scraping or pressing 
keys and the sounds are uneven 
and imprecise — flickering around 
the proper pitches but missing by a 
fraction of a tone. The human 
element; Michael, whose sense of 
pitch is unusually good, cringes at 
these tiny but perceptible varia- 
tions from the absolute. Yet the 
farmers don’t seem to mind. Un- 
spoiled by the mechanical perfec- 
tion of modern scientific music. 
Hundreds of them, perhaps the en- 
tire population of the village, sit in 
ragged rows along the perimeter of 
the plaza, nodding in time to the 
wailing, screeching melodies, 
pounding their heels against the 
ground, rhythmically clapping 
their hands to their elbows. The 
light of the fire transforms them 
into an assemblage of demons; the 
red glow ripples eerily over their 
half-nude bodies. He sees children 
among them, but still not very 
many. Two here, three there, 
many adult couples with one or 
none. Stunned by the realization: 



they limit births here. His skin 
crawls. He is amused by his own 
involuntary reaction of horror; it 
tells him that no matter what con- 
figuration his genes may have, he 
is by conditioning a man of the 
urbmons. 

The music grows even wilder. 
The fire soars. The farmers now 
begin to dance. Michael expects 
the dancing to be amorphous and 
frantic, a helter-skelter flinging-out 
of arms and legs, but no: surpris- 
ingly, it is tight and disciplined, a 
controlled and formal series of 
movements. Men in this row, 
women in that; forward, back, in- 
terchange partners, elbows high, 
head thrown back, knees pumping, 
now hop, turn around, form lines 
again, link hand^. The pace con- 
stantly accelerating, but the 
rhythms always distinct and co- 
herent. A ritualized progression of 
patterns. Eyes glazed, lips tight. 
This is no revel, he is suddenly 
aware, it is a religious festival. The 
rites of the commune people. 
What are they building toward? Is 
he the sacrificial lamb? Providence 
has sent them an urbmon man, eh? 
Panicky, he looks about for signs 
of a caldron, a spit, a stake, any- 
thing on which they might cook 
him. Tales of the commune circu- 
late gaudily in the urbmon; he has 
always dismissed them as igno- 
rant myths. But possibly not. 

When they come for him, he de- 
cides, he will lunge and attack 
them. Better to be shot down 



28

quickly than to die on the village 
altar. 

Yet half an hour passes and no 
one has even looked in the direc- 
tion of his cell. The dancing has 
continued without a break. Oiled 
with sweat, the farmers seem like 
dream-figures, glittering, gro- 
tesque. Bare breasts hobbling; nos- 
trils distended, eyes aglow. New 
boughs on the fire. The musicians 
goading one another into fresh 
frenzies. And now, what’s this? 
Masked figures parading solemnly 
into the plaza: three men, three 
women. Faces hidden by intricate 
spherical constructions, nightmar- 
ish, bestial, garish. The women 
carry oval baskets in which can be 
seen products of the commune: 
seeds, dried ears of corn, ground 
meal. The men encircle a seventh 
person, a woman, two of them 
tugging at her arms and one push- 
ing her from behind. She is preg- 
nant, well along, into her sixth or 
even seventh month. She wears no 
mask, and her face is tense and rig- 
id, the lips clamped, the eyes wide 
and frightened. They fling her 
down before the fire, and stand 
flanking her. She kneels, head 
drooping, long hair almost touch- 
ing the ground, swollen breasts 
swaying with each ragged intake of 
breath. One of the masked men — 
it is impossible not to think of 
them as priests — intones a reso- 
nant invocation. One of the 
masked women places an ear of 
corn in each hand of the pregnant 



one. Another sprinkles her back 
with meal; it sticks to her sweaty 
skin. The third scatters seeds in her 
hair. The other two men join the 
chant. Michael, gripping the bars 
of his cell, feels as though he has 
been hurled thousands of years 
back in time, to some Neolithic 
festival; it is almost impossible for 
him to believe that one day’s 
march from here rises the thou- 
sand-story bulk of Urban Monad 
116. 



>PHEY have finished anointing 
* the pregnant woman with pro- 
duce. Now two of the priests lift 
her, shaking, to a standing posi- 
tion, and one of the priestesses rips 
away her single garment. A howl 
from the villagers. They spin her 
around. Displaying her nakedness 
to all. The heavy protruding belly, 
drum-tight, glistening in the fire- 
light. The broad hips and solid 
thighs, the meaty buttocks. Sens- 
ing something sinister just ahead, 
Michael presses his face against 
the bars, fighting off terror. Is she 
and not he the sacrificial victim? 
A flashing knife, the unborn fetus 
ripped from the womb, a devilish 
propitiation of the harvest gods? 
Please, no. Maybe he is to be the 
chosen executioner. His feverish 
imagination, unbidden, supplies 
the scenario: he sees himself taken 
from the cell, thrust into the plaza, 
a sickle pushed into his hand, the 
woman lying spreadeagled near the

fire, belly upturned, the priests 
chanting, the priestesses leaping, 
and in pantomime they tell him 
what he must do, they indicate the 
taut curve of her body, draw their 
fingers across the preferred place 
of incision, while the music climbs 
toward insanity and the fire flares 
ever higher, and. No. No. He 
turns away, flinging one arm over 
his eyes. Shivering, nauseated. 
When he can bring himself to look 
again, he sees that the villagers 
are getting up and dancing toward 
the fire, toward the pregnant wom- 
an. She stands flatfooted, bewil- 
dered, clutching the ears of corn, 
pressing her thighs together, wrig- 
gling her shoulders in a way that 
somehow indicates she is shamed 
by her nudity. And they caper 
around her. Shouting raucous 
abuse. Making the four- fingered 
jab of contempt. Pointing, mock- 
ing, accusing. A condemned witch? 
An adulteress? The woman shrinks 
into herself. Suddenly the mob 
closes in on her. He sees them 
slapping her, pushing her, spitting 
at her. God bless, no! “Let her 
alone!” he screams. “You filthy 
grubbos, get your hands off her!” 
His wails are drowned by the mu- 
sic. A dozen or so farmers now 
ring the woman and they are shov- 
ing her back and forth. A double- 
handed push; she staggers, barely 
managing to stay upright, and 
stumbles across the ring, only to 
be seized by her breasts and 
slammed back the other way. She 



is panting, wild with terror, search- 
ing for escape, but the ring is tight, 
and they fling her around. When at 
last she drops, they tug her upright 
and toss her some more, grabbing 
her arms and whirling her from 
hand to hand around the ring. 
Then the circle opens. Other vil- 
lagers sweep toward her. More 
abuse. The blows all are open- 
handed ones and no one seems to 
hit her belly — yet they are deliv- 
ered with great force. A trickle of 
blood stains her chin and throat 
and one knee and one buttock are 
scraped raw from her having been 
knocked to the ground. She is 
limping, too; she must have turned 
an ankle. Vulnerable as she is in 
her nakedness, she makes no at- 
tempt to defend herself or even to 
protect her pregnancy. Clutching 
the ears of corn, she simply ac- 
cepts her torment, letting herself 
be hurled about, allowing the vin- 
dictive hands to poke and pinch 
and slap her. The mob surges 
about her, everyone having a turn. 
How much more can she take? Is 
the idea to beat her to death? To 
make her drop her baby while they 
watch? He has never imagined 
anything so chilling. He feels the 
blows as if they were landing on 
his own body. If he could he would 
strike these people dead with thun- 
derbolts. Where is their respect for 
life? That woman should be sa- 
cred. Instead they torture her. 

She vanishes under a horde of 
screaming attackers.

GALAXY 




When they clear away, a min- 
ute or two later, she is kneeling, 
half conscious, close to collapse. 
Her lips writhe in hysterical, chok- 
ing sobs. Her entire body is trem- 
bling. Her head hangs forward. 
Someone’s clawed hand has left a 
series of parallel bloody tracks 
across the globe of her right 
breast. She is smudged everywhere 
with dirt. 

The music grows oddly soft, as 
if some climax were approaching 
and momentum had to be gained. 
Now they come for me, Michael 
thinks. Now I’m supposed to kill 
her or top her or kick her in the 
belly or god knows what. But no 
one even looks toward the building 
in which he is jailed. The three 
priests are chanting in unison; the 
music gains gradually in intensity; 
the villagers fall back, clustering 
along the perimeter of the plaza. 
And the woman rises, shakily, un- 
certainly. She looks down at her 
bloodied and battered self. Her 
face wholly blank; she is beyond 
pain, beyond shame, beyond ter- 
ror. Slowly she walks toward the 
fire. Stumbles once. Recovers, 
stays upright. Now she stands at 
the edge of the fire, almost with- 
in reach of the licking tongues of 
flame. Her back to him. Plump 
heavy rump, deeply dimpled. 
Scratches on her back. Wide pel- 
vis, the bones spreading out as the 
little’s time approaches. The mu- 
sic is deafening now. The priests 
silent, frozen. Obviously the great 



moment. Does she leap into the 
flames? 

No. Raises her arms. The ears 
of corn outlined against the bright- 
ness of the fire. Throws them in; 
two quick flares and they vanish. 
An immense roar from the vil- 
lagers, a tremendous crashing dis- 
cord from the musicians. The na- 
ked woman stumbles away from 
the fire, tottering, exhausted. 
Falls, landing with a thump on her 
left haunch, lies there sobbing. 
Priests and priestesses march into 
the darkness with stiff, pompous 
strides. The villagers simply fade 
away, leaving only the woman 
crumpled in the plaza. And a man 
coming toward her, a tall, bearded 
figure; Michael remembers seeing 
him in the midst of the mob when 
they were beating her. Lifts her 
now. Cradles her tenderly against 
him. Kisses her scratched breast. 
Runs his hand lightly over her 
belly, as though assuring himself 
that the child is unharmed. She 
clings close. He talks softly to her; 
the alien words drift across to 
Michael’s cell. She replies, stam- 
mering, her voice thick with shock. 
Unbothered by her weight, the man 
sweeps her into his arms and slowly 
carries her away, toward one of 
the buildings on the opposite side 
of the plaza. All is still, now. Only 
the fire remains, crackling harshly, 
crumbling in upon itself. When, 
after a long while, no one appears 
Michael turns away from his win- 
dow and, stunned, baffled, throws

himself on his blankets. Silence. 
Darkness. Images of the bizarre 
ceremony churn in his mind. He 
shivers; he trembles; he feels al- 
most at the edge of tears. Finally 
he sleeps. 

Ill 

T he arrival of breakfast awakens 
him. He studies the tray a few 
minutes before forcing himself to 
get up. Stiff and sore from yester- 
day’s walking; every muscle pro- 
testing. Doubled up, he hobbles to 
the window: a heap of ashes where 
the fire had been, villagers moving 
about on their morning chores, the 
farming machines already heading 
toward the fields. He splashes wa- 
ter in his face, voids his wastes, 
looks automatically for the cleans- 
er and, not finding it, begins to 
wonder how he will tolerate the 
crust of grime that has accumu- 
lated on his skin. He had not real- 
ized before how ingrained a habit it 
was for him to get under the ultra- 
sonic wave at the beginning of each 
day. He goes then to the tray: 
juice, bread, cold fruit, wine. It will 
do. Before he is finished eating, his 
cell door comes in and a woman 
enters, clad in the usual brief com- 
mune costume. He knows instinc- 
tively that she is someone of im- 
portance; her eyes have the clear 
cold light of authority, and her 
expression is an intelligent, percep- 
tive one. She is perhaps thirty years 
old and, like most of these farming 



women’s, her body is lean and 
taut, with supple muscles, long 
limbs, small breasts. She reminds 
him in some ways of Micaela, al- 
though her hair is auburn and 
close-cropped, not long and black. 
A weapon is strapped to her left 
thigh. 

“Cover yourself,” she says 
briskly. “I don’t welcome the 
sight of your nakedness. Cover 
yourself and then we can talk.” 

She speaks the urbmon tongue! 
A strange accent, true, with every 
word cut short as if her sharp shin- 
ing teeth have clipped its tail as it 
passes her lips. The vowels blurred 
and distorted. But unmistakably 
the language of his native building. 
Immense relief. Communication 
at last. 

He pulls on his clothing hastily. 
She watches him, stony-faced. A 
tough one, she is. He says, “In the 
urbmons we don’t worry much 
about covering our bodies. We live 
in what we call a post-privacy cul- 
ture. I didn’t realize — ” 

“You don’t happen to be in an 
urbmon just now.” 

“I realize that. I’m sorry if I’ve 
given offense through my ignor- 
ance of your customs.” 

He is fully dressed. She seems 
to soften a bit, perhaps at his apol- 
ogy, perhaps merely because he 
has concealed his nudity. Taking a 
few steps farther into the room, 
she says, “It’s a long time since 
we’ve had a spy from your people 
among us.”

“I’m not a spy.” 

A cool, skeptical smile. “No? 
Then why are you here?” 

“I didn’t intend to trespass on 
your commune’s land. I was just 
passing through, heading east- 
ward. On my way toward the sea.” 

“Really?” As though he had 
said he had set out to walk to Plu- 
to. “Traveling alone, are you?” 

“I am.” 

“When did this marvelous jour- 
ney begin?” 

“Yesterday morning, very ear- 
ly,” Michael says. “I’m from Ur- 
ban Monad 116. A computer pri- 
mer, if that means anything to 
you. Suddenly I felt I couldn’t 
stay inside that building any more, 
that I had to find out what the 
outside world was like, so I ar- 
ranged to get an egress pass, 
slipped out just before dawn and 
started walking. I came to your 
fields and you machines saw me, I 
guess, and I was picked up. Be- 
cause of the language problem I 
couldn’t explain to anyone who 
I—” 

“What do you hope to gain by 
spying on us?” 

His shoulders slump. “I told 
you,” he says wearily. “I’m not 
a spy.” 

Urbmon people don’t slip out 
of their buildings. I’ve dealt with 
your kind for years; I know how 
your minds work.” Her eyes level 
with his. Cold, cold. “You’d be 
paralyzed with terror five minutes 
after you set out,” she assures 



him. “Obviously you’ve been 
trained for this mission or you’d 
never have been able to keep your 
sanity for a full day in the fields. 
What I don’t understand is why 
they’d send you. You have your 
world and we have ours. There’s 
no conflict, no overlapping. 
There’s no need for espionage.” 

“I agree,” Michael says. “And , 
that’s why I’m not a spy.” He | 
finds himself drawn to her despite j 
the severity of her attitude. Her 
competence and self-confidence 
attract him. And if she would only 
smile she would be quite beautiful. 

He says, “Look, how can I get 
you to believe this? I just wanted 
to see the world outside the urb- 
mon. All my life indoors. Never 
smelling fresh air, never feeling 
the sun on my skin. Thousands of 
people living on top of me. Tm 
not really well adjusted to urbmon 
society, I diseovered. So I went 
outside. Not a spy. All I want to 
do is travel. To tne sea, particu- 
larly. Have you ever seen the sea? 
No? That’s my dream — to walk 
along the shore, to hear the waves 
rolling in, to feel the wet sand un- 
der my feet — ” 

P OSSIBLY the fervor in his 
tone is beginning to convince 
her. She shrugs, looking less 
flinty, and says, “What’s your 
name?” 

“Michael Statler.” 

“Age?” 

“Twenty-three.”

“We could put you aboard the 
next courier pod — with the fungus 
shipment. You’d be back at your 
urbmon in half an hour.” 

“No,” he says softly. “Don’t do 
that. Just let me keep going east. 
I’m not ready to go back so 
soon.” 

“Haven’t gathered enough in- 
formation, you mean?” 

“I told you. I’m not — ” He 
stops, realizing she is teasing him. 

“All right. Maybe you aren’t a 
spy. Just a madman, perhaps.” 
She smiles for the first time and 
slides down until she is squatting 
against the wall, facing him. In an 
easy conversational tone she says, 
“What do you think of our vil- 
lage, Statler?” 

“I don’t even know where to be- 
gin answering that.” 

“How do we strike you? Sim- 
ple? Complicated? Evil? Frighten- 
ing? Unusual?” 

“Strange,” he says. 

“Strange in comparison to the 
kind of people you’ve lived among, 
or just strange, absolutely?” 

“I’m not sure I know the dis- 
tinction. It’s like another world 
out here, anyway. I — I — what’s 
your name, by the way?” 

“Artha.” 

“Arthur? Among us that’s a 
man’s name.” 

“A-R-T-H-A.” 

“Oh. Artha. How interesting. 
How beautiful.” He knots his fin- 
gers tightly. “The way you live so 
close to the soil here, Artha. 



There’s something dreamlike 
about that for me. These little 
houses. The plaza. Seeing you 
walking around in the open. The 
sun. Building fires. Not having 
any upstairs or downstairs. And 
that business last night, the music, 
the pregnant woman. What was 
that all about?” 

“You mean the unbirth dance?” 

“Is that what it was? Some kind 
of — ” he falters — “sterility rite?” 

“To insure a good harvest,” 
Artha says. “To keep the crops 
healthy and childbirths low. We 
have rules about breeding, you un- 
derstand.” 

“And the woman everybody was 
hitting — she got pregnant illegally, 
is that it?” 

“Oh, no.” Artha laughs. “Mil- 
cha’s child is quite legal.” 

“Then why — tormenting her like 
that — she could have lost the 
child—” 

“Someone had to do it,” Artha 
tells him. “The commune has elev- 
en pregnants, just now. They drew 
lots and Milcha lost. Or won. It 
isn’t punishment, Statler. It’s a 
religious thing: she’s the celebrant, 
the holy scapegoat, the — the— I 
don’t have the words in your lan- 
guage. Through her suffering she 
brings health and prosperity upon 
the commune. Insuring that no 
unwanted children will come into 
our women, that all will remain in 
perfect balance. Of course, it’s 
painful for . her. And there’s the 
shame, being naked in front of 



34 



GALAXY 




everyone. But it has to be done. 
It’s a great honor. Milcha will 
never have to do it again and she’ll 
have certain privileges for the rest 
of her life. And of course everyone 
is grateful to her for accepting our 
blows. Now we’re protected for 
another year.” 

“Protected?” 

“Against the anger of the 
gods.” 

“Gods,” he says quietly. Swal- 
lowing the word and trying to 
comprehend it. After a moment he 
asks, “Why do you try to avoid 
having children?” 

“Do you think we own the 
world?” she replies, her eyes 
abruptly fiery. “We have our 
commune. Our allotted zone of 
land. We must make food for our- 
selves and also for the urbmons, 
right? What would happen to you 
if we simply bred and bred and 
bred — until our village sprawled 
out over half of the present fields 
and such remaining food as we 
produced was merely enough for 
our own needs? With nothing to 
Spare for you. Children must be 
housed. Houses occupy land. How 
can we farm land covered by a 
house? We must set limits.” 

“But you don’t need to sprawl 
your village out into the fields. 
You could build upward. As we 
do. And increase your numbers 
tenfold without taking up any 
more land area. Well, of course, 
you’d need more food and there’d 
be less to ship to us, but — ” 



“You absolutely don’t under- 
stand,” Artha snaps. “Should we 
turn our commune into an urb- 
mon? You have your way of life; 
we have ours. Ours requires us to 
be few in number and live in the 
midst of fertile fields. Why should 
we become like you? We pride 
ourselves not being like you. So if 
we expand we must expand hori- 
zontally, right? Which would in 
time cover the surface of the world 
with a dead crust of paved streets 
and roads, as in the former days. 
No. We are beyond such things. 
We impose limits on ourselves 
and live in the proper rhythm of 
our way — and we are happy. And 
so it shall be forever with us. Does 
this seem so wicked? We think the 
urbmon folk are wicked, for they 
will not control their breeding. 
And even encourage breeding.” 

“Yhere’s no need for us to con- 
trol it,” he tells her. “It’s been 
mathematically proven that we 
haven’t begun to exhaust the pos- 
sibilities of the planet. Our pop- 
ulation could double or even triple 
— and as long as we continue to 
live in vertical cities, in urban mo- 
nads, there’d be room for every- 
one. Without encroaching on pro- 
ductive farmland. We build a new 
urbmon every few years and even 
so the food supplies aren’t dimin- 
ishing, the rhythm of our way 
holds up and — ” 

“Do you think this can continue 
infinitely?” 

“Well, no, not infinitely,” 



THE WORLDOUTSIDE 



35 




Michael concedes. “But for a long 
time. Five hundred years, maybe, 
at the present rate of increase, be- 
fore we’re feeling any squeeze.” 

“And then?” 

“They can solve that problem 
when the time comes.” 

Artha shakes her head furious- 
ly. “No! No! How can you say 
such a thing? To go on breeding, 
letting the future worry about 
it~” 

“Look,” he says, “I’ve talked 
to my brother-in-law, who’s a his- 
torian. Specializes in the twentieth 
century. Back then it was believed 
that everybody would starve if the 
world’s population got past five or 
six billion. Much talk of a popula- 
tion crisis, etc. etx. Well, then 
came the collapse and afterward 
things were reorganized. The first 
urbmons went up, the old horizon- 
tal pattern of land use was prohib- 
ited and guess what? We found 
there was room for ten billion 
people. And then twenty. And then 
fifty. And now seventy-five. Taller 
buildings, more efficient food pro- 
duction, greater concentration of 
people on the unproductive land. 
So who are we to say that our de- 
scendants won’t continue to cope 
with expanding population on up 
to five hundred billion, a thousand 
billion — who knows? The twen- 
tieth century wouldn’t have be- 
lieved it was possible to support 
this many people on Earth. So if 
we worry in advance about a prob- 
lem that may in fact never cause 



any trouble, if we unblessworthily 
thwart god by limiting births, we 
sin against life without any assur- 
ance that — ” 

“Pah!” Artha snorts. “You will 
never understand us. And I sup- 
pose we will never understand 
you.” Rising, she strides toward 
the door. “Tell me this, then. If 
the urbmon way is so wonderful, 
why did you slip away and come 
wandering in our fields?” And she 
does not stay for an answer. The 
door clicks behind her; he goes to 
it and finds that she has locked it. 
He is alone. And still a prisoner. 

A long drab day. No one 
comes to him, except the girl 
bringing lunch: in and out. The 
stench of the cell oppresses him. 
The lack of a cleanser becomes 
unbearable; he imagines that the 
filth gathering on his skin is pitting 
and corroding it. From his narrow 
window he watches the life of the 
commune, craning his neck to see 
it all. The farming machines com- 
ing and going. The husky peasants 
loading sacks of produce aboard a 
conveyor belt disappearing into 
the ground — going, no doubt, to 
the courier-pod system that car- 
ries food to the urbmons and in- 
dustrial goods to the communes. 
Last night’s scapegoat, Milchd, 
passes by, limping, bruised, ap- 
parently exempt from work today; 
villagers hail her with obvious rev- 
erence. She smiles and pats her 
belly. He does not see Artha at

GALAXY 




all. Why do they not release him? 
He is fairly certain that he has 
convinced her he is no spy. And in 
any case can hardly harm the 
commune. Yet here he remains as 
the afternoon fades. The busy peo- 
ple outside, sweating, suntanned, 
purposeful. He sees only a speck 
of the commune: outside the scope 
of his vision there must be schools, 
a theater, a governmental build- 
ing, warehouses, repair shops. 
Images of last night’s unbirth 
dance glow morbidly in his mem- 
ory. The barbarism; the wild mu- 
sic; the agony of the woman. But 
he knows that it is an error to 
think of these farmers as primi- 
tive, simple folk, despite such 
things. They seem bizarre to him 
but their savagery is only super- 
ficial, a mask they don to set 
themselves apart from the urban 
people. This is a complex society 
held in a delicate balance. As com- 
plex as is his own. Sophisticated 
machinery to care for. Doubtless 
a computer center somewhere, 
controlling the planting and tend- 
ing and harvesting of the crops — 
the operation requires a staff of 
skilled technicians. Biological 
needs to consider: pesticides, 
weed-suppression, all the ecologi- 
cal intricacies. And the problems 
of the barter system that ties the 
commune to the urbmons. He per- 
ceives only the surface of this 
place, he realizes. 

In late afternoon Artha returns 
to his cell. 



“Will they let me go soon?” he 
asks immediately. 

She shakes her head. “It’s under 
discussion. I’ve recommended 
your release. But some of them 
are very suspicious people.” 

“Who do you mean?” 

“The chiefs. You know, they’re 
old men, most of them, with a nat- 
ural mistrust of strangers. A 
couple of them want to sacrifice 
you to the harvest god.” 

“Sacrifice?’’ 

Artha grins. There is nothing 
stony about her now; she is re- 
laxed, clearly friendly. On his side. 
“It sounds horrid, doesn’t it? But 
it’s been known to happen. Our 
gods occasionally demand lives. 
Don’t you ever take life in the 
urbmon?” 

“When someone threatens the 
stability of our society, yes,” he 
admits. “Lawbreakers go down 
the chute. Into the combustion 
chambers at the bottom of the 
building. Contributing their body 
mass to our energy output. 
But—” 

“So you kill for the sake of 
keeping everything running 
smoothly. Well, sometimes so do 
we. Not often. I don’t really think 
they’ll kill you. But it isn’t decided 
yet.” 

“When will it be?” 

“Perhaps tonight. Or tomor- 
row.” 

“How can I represent any threat 
to the commune?” 

“No one says you do,” Artha 



THE WORLDOUTSIDE 



37 




tells him. “Even so, to offer the 
life of an urbmon man may have 
positive values here. Increasing 
our blessings. It’s a philosophical 
thing, not easy to explain: the urb- 
mons are the ultimate consumers 
and if our harvest god symbolical- 
ly consumed an urbmon instead, 
in a metaphorical way, taking you 
to stand for the whole society you 
come from, it would be a mystic 
affirmation of the unity of the two 
societies, the link that binds com- 
mune to urbmon and urbmon to 
commune and — oh, never mind. 
Maybe they’ll forget about it. It’s 
only the day after the unbirth 
dance; we don’t need any more 
sacred protection so soon. I’ve 
told them that. I’d say your chanc- 
es of going free are fairly good.” 

“Fairly good,” he repeats 
gloomily. “Wonderful.” The dis- 
tant sea. The ashy cone of Vesu- 
vius. Jerusalem. The Taj Mahal. 
As far away as the stars, now. The 
sea. The sea. This stinking cell. He 
chokes on despair. 

Artha tries to cheer him. Squat- 
ting close beside him on the tipsy 
floor. Her eyes warm, affection- 
ate. Her earlier military brusque- 
ness gone. She seems fond of him. 
Getting to know him better as if 
she has surmounted the barrier of 
cultural differences that made him 
seem so alien to her before. And 
he the same with her. The separa- 
tions dwindling. Her world is not 
his but he thinks he could adjust 
to some of its unfamiliar assump- 



tions. Strike up a closeness. He’s 
a man, she’s a woman, right? The 
basics. All the rest is facade. But 
as they talk he is plunged again 
and again into new awarenesses of 
how different she is from him, he 
from her. He asks her about her- 
self and she says she is unmarried. 
Stunned, he tells her that there are 
no unmarried people in the urb- 
mons past the age of twelve or 
thirteen. She says she is thirty-one. 
Why has someone so attractive 
never married? “We have enough 
married women here,” she replies. 
“I had no reason to marry.” Does 
she not want to bear children? No, 
not at all. The commune has its 
allotted number of mothers. She 
has other responsibilities ot oc- 
cupy her. “Such as?” She explains 
that she is part of the liaison staff 
handling urbmon commerce. 
Which is why she can speak the 
language so well; she deals fre- 
quently with the urbmons, arrang- 
ing for exchanges of produce for 
manufactured goods, setting up 
servicing arrangements whenever 
the commune’s machinery suffers 
a breakdown beyond the skills of 
the village technicians — and so 
forth, “I may have monitored 
your calls occasionally,” he says. 
“Some of the nodes I prime run 
through the procurement level. If 
I ever get back home. I’ll listen for 
you, Artha.” Her smile is daz- 
zling. He begins to suspect that 
love is blossoming in this cell. 

She asks him about the urbmon. 



38 



GALAXY 




S HE has never been inside one; 

all her contacts with the urban 
monads come via communications 
channels. A vast curiosity is evi- 
dent in her. She wants him to de- 
scribe the residential apartments, 
the transport system, liftshafts and 
dropshafts, the schools, the recre- 
ational facilities. Who prepares 
the food? Who decides what pro- 
fessions the children will follow? 
Can you move from one city to 
another? Where do you keep all 
the new people? How do you man- 
age not to hate each other, when 
you must live so close together? 
Don’t you feel like prisoners? 
Thousands of you milling about 
like bees in a hive — how do you 
stand it? And the stale air, the pale 
artificial light, the separation 
from the natural world. Incompre- 
hensible to her; such a narrow, 
compressed life. And he tries to 
tell her about the urbmon, how 
even he, who chose to flee from it, 
really loves it. The subtle balance 
of need and want in it, the elabor- 
ate social system designed for 
minimal friction and frustration, 
the sense of community within 
one’s own city and village, the 
glorification of parenthood, the 
colossal mechanical minds in the 
service core that keep the delicate 
interplay of urban rhythms coor- 
dinated — he makes the building 
seem a poem of human relation- 
ships, a miracle of civilized harm- 
onies. His words soar. Artha 
seems captivated. He goes on and 



on, in a kind of rapture of narra- 
tive, describing toilet facilities, 
sleeping arrangements, screens and 
data terminals, the recycling and 
reprocessing of urine and feces, 
the combustion of solid refuse, the 
auxiliary generators that produce 
electrical power from accumu- 
lated surplus body heat, the air 
vents and circulation system, the 
social complexity of the building’s 
different levels, maintenance peo- 
ple here, industrial workers there, 
scholars, entertainers, engineers, 
computer technicians, adminis- 
trators. The senior citizen dorms, 
the newlywed dorms, the marriage 
customs, the sweet tolerance of 
others, the sternly enforced con> 
mandment against selfishness. Ar- 
tha nods and fills in words for him 
when he leaves a sentence half-fin- 
ished to hurry on to the next and 
her face grows flushed with excite- 
ment, as if she, too, were caught 
up in the lyricism of his account 
of the building. Seeing for the first 
time in her life that it is not neces- 
sarily brutal and antihuman to 
pack hundreds of thousands of 
people into a single structure in 
which they spend their entire lives. 
As he speaks he wonders whether 
he is not letting himself be carried 
away by his own rhetoric; the 
words rushing from him must 
make him sound like an impas- 
sioned propagandist for a way of 
life about which, after all, he had 
come to have serious doubts. But 
yet he goes on describing and, by 



THE WORLDOUTSIDE

implication, praising the urbmon. 
He will not condemn. There was 
no other way for humanity to de- 
velop. The necessity of the vertical 
city. The beauty of the urbmon. 
Its wondrous complexity, its intri- 
cate texture. Yes, of course, there 
is beauty outside it, he admits that 
— he has gone in search of it — but 
it is folly to think that the urbmon 
itself is something loathsome, 
something to be deplored. In its 
own way magnificent. The unique 
solution to the population crisis. 
Heroic response to immense chal- 
lenge. And he thinks he is getting 
through to her. This shrewd, cool 
commune woman, raised under 
the hot sun. His verbal intoxica- 
tion transforms itself into some- 
thing explicity sexual now: he is 
communicating with Artha, he is 
reaching her mind, they are com- 
ing together in a way that neither 
of them would have thought possi- 
ble yesterday, and he interprets 
this new closeness as a physical 
thing. The natural eroticism of the 
urbmon-dweller: everyone accessi- 
ble to everyone else at all times. 
Confirm their closeness by the di- 
rect embrace. It seems like the 
most reasonable extension of their 
communion, from the conversa- 
tional to the copulatory. So close 
already. Her eyes shining. Her 
small breasts. Reminding him of 
Micaela. He leans toward her. 
Left hand slipping around her 
shoulders, fingers groping for and 
finding her nearer breast. Cupping 



it. Nuzzles the line of her jaw with 
his lips, going toward her earlobe. 
His other hand at her waist, seek- 
ing the secret of her one garment. 
In a moment she’ll be naked. His 
body against hers, approaching 
congruency. Cunning, experienced 
fingers opening the way for his 
thrust. And then. 

“No. Stop.” 

“You don’t mean that, Artha.” 
Loosening the glossy red wrap 
now. Clutching the hard little 
breast. Hunting for her mouth. 
“You’re all tensed up. Why not 
relax? Loving is blessworthy. Lov- 
ing is — ” 

“Stop it." 

Flinty again. A sharp-edged 
command. Suddenly struggling in 
his arms. 

Is this the commune mode of 
lovemaking? The pretense of resis- 
tance? She grasps at her wrap, 
pushes him with her elbow, tries to 
bring up her knee. He surrounds 
her with his arms and attempts to 
press her to the floor. Still cares- 
sing. Kissing. Murmuring her 
name. 

“Getr#” 

This is a wholly new experience 
for him. A reluctant woman, all 
sinews and bone, fighting his ad- 
vances. In the urbmon she could 
be put to death for this. Unbless- 
worthy thwarting of a fellow citi- 
zen. But this is not the urbmon. 
This is not the urbmon. Her strug- 
gles inflame him; as it is he has 
gone several days without a wom-

an, the longest span of abstinence 
he can remember, and he is stiff, 
agonizingly erect, carrying a blaz- 
ing sword. No finesse possible; he 
wants in, as quickly as it can be 
managed. “Artha. Artha. Artha.” 
Primordial grunts. Her body pin- 
ned beneath him. The wrap off; as 
they fight he catches a glimpse of 
slender thighs, matted auburn del- 
ta. The flat girlish belly of the un- 
childed. If he can only get his own 
clothes off somehow, while hold- 
ing her down. Fighting like a de- 
mon. Good thing she wasn’t wear- 
ing her weapon when she came in. 
Watch out, the eyes! Panting and 
gasping. A wild flurry of hammer- 
ing fists. The salty taste of blood 
on his split lip. He looks into her 
eyes and is appalled. Her rigid, 
murderous gaze. The harder she 
fights, the more he wants her. A 
savage! If this is how she fights, 
how will she love? She starts to 
scream; he gets his mouth down 
on her lips; her teeth hunt for his 
flesh. Fingernails clawing his back. 
She is surprisingly strong. 
“Artha,” he begs, “don’t fight me. 
This is insanity. If you’ll only — ” 

“Animal!” 

“Let me show you how much I 
love^” 

“Lunatic!” 

Her knee suddenly in his crotch. 
He pivots, avoiding the worst of 
her attack, but she hurts him any- 
way. This is no coy game. If he 
wants to have her he must break 
her strength. Immobilize her. Rap- 



ing an unconscious woman? No. 
No. It has all gone wrong. Sadness 
overwhelms him. His lust sudden- 
ly subsides. He rolls free of her 
and kneels near the window, look- 
ing at the floor, breathing hard. 
Go on, tell the old men what I did. 
Feed me to your god. Naked, 
standing above him, she sullenly 
dons her wrap. The harsh sound of 
her breathing. He says, “In an urb- 
mon, when someone makes sexual 
advances it’s considered highly im- 
proper to refuse him.” His voice 
hollow with shame. “I was at- 
tracted to you, Artha. I thought 
you were to me. And then it was 
too late for me to stop myself.” 
“What animals you all must 
be!” 

Unable to meet her eyes. “In 
context, it makes sense. We can’t 
allow explosive frustration-situa- 
tions. No room for conflicts in an 
urbmon. But here — it’s different, 
is it?” 

“Very.” 

“Can you forgive me?” 

“We couple with those we deep- 
ly love,” she says. “We don’t open 
for anyone at all who asks. Nor is 
it a simple thing. There are rituals 
of approach. Intermediaries must 
be employed. Great complications. 
But how could you have known 
all that?” 

“Exactly. How could I?” 

Her voice whiplashing with irri- 
tation and exasperation. “We 
were getting along so well! Why 
did you have to touch me?”

“You said it yourself. I didn’t 
know. I didn’t know. The two of 
us together — I could feel the at- 
traction growing — it was so nat- 
ural for me to reach out — ’’ 

“And it was so natural for you 
to try to rape me — ’’ 

“I stopped in time, didn’t I?’’ 

A bitter laugh. “So to speak. If 
you call that stopping. If you call 
that in time.’’ 

“Resistance isn’t an easy thing 
for me to understand, Artha. I 
thought you were playing a game 
with me. I didn’t realize at first 
that you were refusing me.’’ Look- 
ing up at her now. Her eyes hold- 
ing mingled contempt and sorrow. 
“It was all a misunderstanding, 
Artha. Can’t we turn time back 
half an hour? Can’t we try to put 
things together again?” 

“I will remember your hands on 
my body. I will remember your 
making me naked.” 

“Don’t carry a grudge. Try to 
look at it from my point of view. 
The cultural gulf between us. A 
different set of assumptions in 
operation. I — ” 

She shakes her head slowly. No 
hope of forgiveness. 

“Artha-^” 

She goes out. He sits alone in 
the dusk. An hour later his dinner 
comes. Night descends; he eats 
with no interest in his food, nurs- 
ing his bitterness. Engulfed by 
shame. Although he insists he was 
not entirely at fault. A clash of ir- 
reconcilable cultures. It was so nat- 



ural for him. It was so natural. 
And the sadness. Thinking of how 
close they had come to be before 
it happened. How close. 

IV 

S EVERAL hours after sundown 
they begin building a new bon- 
fire in the plaza. He watches 
gloomily. She has gone to the vil- 
lage elders, then, to tell them of 
his attack on her. An outrage; 
they console her and promise ven- 
geance. Now they will surely sacri- 
fice him to their god. His last 
night of life. All the turmoil of his 
existence converging on this day. 
No one to grant a final wish. He’ll 
die miserably, his body unclean. 
Far from home. So young. Jan- 
gling with unfulfilled desires. Nev- 
er to see the sea. 

And what’s this, now? A farm- 
ing machine , being trundled up 
close to the fire, a giant upright 
thing, five meters high, with eight 
long, jointed arms, six many- 
kneed legs, a vast mouth. Some 
kind of harvester, maybe. Its pol- 
ished brown metallic skin reflect- 
ing the fire’s leaping red fingers. 
Like a mighty idol. Moloch. Baal. 
He sees his body swept aloft in the 
great clutching fingers. His head 
nearing the metal mouth. The vil- 
lagers capering about him in 
rhythmic frenzy. Bruised swollen 
Milcha chanting ecstatically as he 
goes to his doom. Icy Artha re- 
joicing in her triumph. Her purity

restored by his sacrifice. The 
priests droning. Please, no. No. 
Perhaps he’s all wrong. Last night, 
the sterility rite, he thought they 
were punishing the pregnant one. 
And she was really the most hon- 
ored one. But how vicious that 
machine looks! How deadly! 

The plaza is full of villagers 
now. A major event. 

Listen, Artha, it was merely a 
misunderstanding. I thought you 
desired me. I was acting within 
the context of my society’s mores, 
can’t you see that? Sex isn’t a big 
complicated operatic thing with 
us. It’s like exchanging smiles. 
Like touching hands. When two 
people are together and there’s an 
attraction they do it, because why 
not? I only wanted to give you 
pleasure, really. We were getting 
along so well together. Really. 

The sound of drums. The awful 
skirling screeches of out-of-tune 
wind instruments. Orgiastic danc- 
ing is starting. God bless, I want to 
live! Here are the priests and 
priestesses in their nightmare 
masks. No doubt of it, the full 
routine. And Tm the central spec- 
tacle tonight. 

An hour passes and the scene in 
the plaza grows more frenzied, but 
no one comes to fetch him. Has 
he misunderstood again? Does to- 
night’s ritual actually concern him 
as little as did the one last night? 

A sound at his door. He hears 
the lock turning. The door opens. 
The priests must be coming for 



him. So now the end is near, eh? 
He braces himself, hoping for a 
painless finish. To die for meta- 
phorical reasons, to become a 
mystic link binding commune to 
urbmon — such a fate seems im- 
probable and unreal to him. But it 
is about to befall him all the same. 
Artha enters the cell. 

She closes the door quickly and 
presses her back against it. The 
only illumination is the streaming 
firelight glaring through his win- 
dow; it shows her to him, her face 
tense and stern, her body rigid. 
This time she wears her weapon. 
Taking no chances. 

“Artha! I—’’ 

“Quiet. If you want to live, keep 
your voice down.” 

“What’s happening out there?” 
“They prepare the harvest god.” 
“For me?” 

“For you.” 

He nods. “You told them I tried 
to rape you, I suppose. And now 
my punishment. All right. All 
right. It isn’t fair, but who expects 
fairness?” 

“I told them nothing,” she says. 
“It was their decision, taken at 
sundown. I did not cause this.” 

She sounds sincere. He wonders. 
She goes on: “They will take 
you before the god at midnight. 
Just now they are praying that he 
will receive you gracefully. It is a 
lengthy prayer.” She walks cau- 
tiously past him, as if expecting 
him to pounce on her again, looks 
through the window. Nods to her-

self. Turns. “Very well. No one 
will notice. Come with me and 
make no sound whatever. If I’m 
caught with you, I’ll have to kill 
you and say you were trying to 
escape. Otherwise it’ll be my life 
too. Come. Come.” 

“Where?” 

"Come!” A fierce impatient 
whispered gust. 

She leads him from the cell. In 
wonder he follows her through a 
labyrinth of passages, through 
dank subterranean chambers, 
through tunnels barely wider than 
himself. They emerge finally at 
the back of the building. He shiv- 
ers; a chill in the night air. Music 
and chanting floating toward him 
from the plaza. Artha gestures, 
runs out between two houses, 
looks in all directions, gestures 
again. He runs after her. By quick 
nervous stages they reach the out- 
er edge of the commune. He 
glances back; from here he can see 
the fire, the idol, the tiny dancing 
figures, like images on a screen. 
Ahead of him are the fields. Above 
him the crescent sliver of the 
moon, the shining sprawl of the 
stars. A sudden sound. Artha 
clutches at him and tugs him 
down, under a clump of shrubs. 
Her body against his; the tips of 
her breasts tike points of fire. He 
does not dare to move or speak. 
Someone goes by: a sentry, may- 
be. Broad back, thick neck. Out 
of sight. Artha, trembling, holds 
his wrists, keeping him down. Then 



at last getting up. Nodding. Si- 
lently saying the way is clear. She 
slips into the fields, between the 
burgeoning rows of tall, leafy 
plants. For perhaps ten minutes 
they trot away from the village, 
until his untrained body is gasp- 
ing for breath. When she halts, the 
bonfire is only a stain on the dis- 
tant horizon and the singing is 
drowned out by the chirping of in- 
sects. “From here you go by your- 
self,” she tells him. “I have to re- 
turn. If anyone misses me for 
long, they might suspect.” 

“Why did you do this?” 

“Because I was unjust to you,” 
she says and manages to smile. A 
ghost-smile, a quick flicker, the 
merest specter of the warmth of 
the afternoon. “You were drawn 
to me. There was no way for you 
to know our attitudes about such 
things. I was cruel, I was hateful 
— and you were only trying to 
show love. I’m sorry, Statler. So 
this is my atonement. Go.” 

“If I could tell you how grate- 
ful—” 

His hand lightly touches her 
arm. He feels her quiver — in de- 
sire, in disgust, what? On a sud- 
den impulse he pulls her into an 
embrace. She is taut at first, then 
melting. Lips to lips. His fingers 
on her bare muscular back. Do I 
dare touch her breasts? Her belly 
pressed to his. He has a quick 
wild vision of this afternoon’s 
breach healed; Artha sinking glad- 
ly to the sweet earth here, drawing

him down on her and into her, the 
union of their bodies creating that 
metaphorical link between urb- 
mon and commune that the elders 
would have forged with his blood. 
But no. It is an unrealistic vision, 
however satisfying artistically. 
There will be no coupling in the 
moonlit field. Artha lives by her 
code. Obviously these thoughts 
have passed through her mind in 
these few seconds, and she has 
considered and rejected the possi- 
bilities of a passionate farewell, 
for now she slides free of him, 
severing the contact moments be- 
fore he can capitalize on her par- 
tial surrender. Her eyes bright and 
loving in the darkness. Her smile 
awkward and divided. “Go, now,” 
she whispers. Turning. Running 
back a dozen paces toward the 
commune. Turning again, gesticu- 
lating with the flats of her hands, 
trying to push him into motion. 
“Go. Go. What are you standing 
there for?” 

H urriedly through the 

moonsilvered night. Stumbling, 
lurching, tripping. He does not 
bother to pick a cautious route be- 
tween the rows of growing things; 
in his haste he tramples plants, 
pushes them aside, leaves a swath 
of destruction by which, come 
dawn, he could readily be traced. 
He knows he must get out of the 
commune’s territory before morn- 
ing. Once the crop-sprayers are 
aloft they can easily find him and 



bring him back to feed him to 
thwarted Moloch. Possibly they 
will send the sprayers out by night 
to hunt for him, as soon as they 
find that he has escaped. Do those 
yellow eyes see in the dark? He 
halts and listens for the horrid 
droning sound but all is still. And 
the farming machines — will they 
go forth to track him down? He 
has to hurry. Presumably if he 
gets beyond the commune’s do- 
main he will be safe from the wor- 
shipers of the harvest god. 

Where shall he go? 

There is only one destination 
conceivable now. Looking toward 
the horizon, he sees the awesome 
columns of the Chipitts urbmons, 
eight or ten of them visible from 
here as brilliant beacons, thou- 
sands of windows ablaze. He can- 
not pick out individual windows 
but he is aware of constant shift- 
ings and flowings in the patterns 
of light as switches go on and off. 
The middle of the evening there. 
Concerts, somatic contests, glow- 
duels, all the nightly amusements 
in full swing. Stacion sitting home, 
fearful, wondering about him. 
How long has he been gone? Two 
days, three? All blurred. The lit- 
tles crying. Micaela distraught, 
probably quarreling mercilessly 
with Jason to ease her tension. 
While here he is, many kilometers 
away, newly fled from a world of 
idols and rites, of pagan dancing, 
of unyielding and infertile women. 
Mud on his shoes, stubble on his

cheeks. He must look awful and 
smell worse. No access to a clean- 
ser. What bacteria now breed in 
his flesh? He must go back. His 
muscles ache so desperately that 
he has passed into a discomfort be- 
yond mere fatigue. The reek of the 
cell clings to his nostrils. His 
tongue feels furry and puffed. He 
imagines that his skin is cracking 
from exposure to sun, moon, air. 



What of the sea? What of Vesu- 
vius and the Taj Mahal? 

Not this time. He is willing to 
admit defeat. He has gone as far 
as he dares, and for as much time 
as he can permit himself; now with 
all his soul he longs for home. His 
conditioning asserting itself after 
all. Environment conquering gene- 
tics. He has had his adventure;

hai dropping in to see Micaela, 
maybe. Jason on his way to his 
grubbo sweethearts in Warsaw or 
Prague. Another few hours, Mich- 
ael supposes, and he will be home. 
It took him only from sunrise to 
late afternoon to reach the com- 
mune and that was with much cir- 
cuitous rambling; with the towers 
rising before him at all times he 
will have no difficulty going 
straight to his goal. 

All is silence. The starry night 
has a magical beauty. He almost 
regrets his decision to return to 
the urbmon. Under the crystalline 
sky he feels the pull of nature. Af- 
ter perhaps four hours of walking 
he stops to bathe in an irrigation 
canal and emerges naked and re- 
freshed; washing with water is not 
as satisfying as getting under the 
ultrasonic cleanser but at least he 
no longer needs to be obsessed 
with the layers of grime and cor- 
ruption clinging to his skin. More 
springily, now, he strides along. 
His adventure already is receding 
into history: he encapsulates it and 
retrospectively relives it. How 
good to have done this. Tasting 
the fresh air, the dawn’s mist, dirt 
under his fingernails. Even his im- 
prisonment now seems a high ex- 
citement rather than an imposi- 
tion. Watching the unbirth dance. 
His fitful, unconsummated love 
for Artha. Their struggle and their 
dreamlike reconciliation. The gap- 
ing jaws of the idol. The fear of 
death. His escape. What man of 



Urbmon 1 16 has done such things? 

This access of self-congratula- 
tion gives him strength that sends 
him plunging on across the com- 
mune’s unending fields in renewed 
vigor. Only the urbmons seem to 
be getting no closer. A trick of 
perspective. His vveary eyes. Is he 
heading, he wonders, toward 116? 
It would be a sad prank of topog- 
raphy to get turned about and 
come into the urban constellation 
at 140 or 145 or so. If, say, he is 
moving at an angle to his true 
course, the divergence could be 
immense by the end of his march, 
leaving him with a dreadful numb- 
ing hypotenuse to traverse. He has 
no way of knowing which of the 
urbmons ahead of him is his own. 
He simply goes onward. 

The moon vanishes. The stars 
fade. Dawn is creeping in. 

He has reached the zone of un- 
used land between the commune’s 
rim and the Chipitts constellation. 
His legs are ablaze but he forces 
himself on. So close to the build- 
ings that they seem to hang, un- 
supported, in midair. The formal 
gardens in view. Robot gardeners 
serenely going about their trade. 
Blossoms opening to the first light 
of day. Perfume drifting on the 
soft breeze. Home. Home. Sta- 
cion. Micaela. Get some rest be- 
fore going back on the interface. 
Find a plausible excuse. 

Which is Urbmon 1 16? 

The towers bear no numbers. 

Those who live inside them know

where they live. Half-staggering, 
Michael approaches the nearest 
building. Its flanks illuminated 
with radiant dawnlight. Looking 
up a thousand floors. The delica- 
cy, the complexity, of its myriad 
tiny chambers. Beneath him the 
mysterious underground roots, 
the power plants, the waste-pro- 
cessing plants, the hidden comput- 
ers, all the concealed wonders that 
give the urbmon its life. And 
above, rising like some immense 
vegetable growth, its sides marvel- 
ously intricate, a hatchwork of 
textures, the urbmon. Within the 
hundreds of thousands of inter- 
woven lives, artists and scholars, 
musicians and sculptors, welders 
and janitors. His eyes are moist. 
Home. Home. But is it? He goes 
to the hatch. Holds up his wrist, 
shows the egress pass. The com- 
puter is authorized to admit him 
on demand. “If this is Urbmon 
116, open up! Tm Michael Stat- 
ler.” Nothing is happening. Scan- 
ners scan him but all stays sealed. 
“What building is this?” he asks. 
Silence. “Come on,” he says. 
“Tell me where I am!” 

A voice from an invisible speak- 
er says, “This is Urban Monad 
One-twenty-three of the Chipitts 
constellation.” 

123! So many kilometers from 
home! 

But he can only continue. Now 
the sun is above the horizon and 
turning quickly from red to gold. 
If that is the east, then where is 



Urbmon 116? He calculates with 
a numbed mind. He must go east. 
Yes? No? He plods through the 
interminable series of gardens sep- 
arating 123 from its eastern neigh- 
bor and interrogates the speaker 
at the hatch. Yes; this is Urbmon 
122. He proceeds. The buildings 
are set at long diagonals, so that 
one will not shade the next, and 
he moves down the center of the 
constellation, keeping careful 
count, while the sun climbs and 
swarms over . him. Dizzy, now, 
with hunger and exhaustion. Is 
this 116? No, he must have lost 
count; it will not open for him. 
Then this? 



Y es. The hatch slides back as he 
offers his pass. Michael clam- 
bers in. Waiting as the door rolls 
shut behind him. Now the inner 
door to open. Waiting. Well? 
“Why don’t you open?” he asks. 
“Here. Here. Scan this.” Holding 
up his pass. Perhaps some kind of 
decontamination procedure. No 
telling what he’s brought in from 
outside. And now the door opens. 

Lights in his eyes. A dazzling 
glare. “Remain where you are. 
Make no attempt to leave the en- 
tryway.” The cold metallic voice 
nailing him where he stands. Blink- 
ing, Michael takes half a step for- 
ward, then realizes it might be un- 
wise and stops. A sweet-smelling 
cloud engulfs him. They have 
sprayed him with something. Con-

gealing fast, forming a security 
cocoon. The lights now go down. 
Figures blocking his path: four, 
five of them. Police. “Michael 
Statler?” one of them asks. 

“I have a pass,” he says uncer- 
tainly. “It’s all quite legitimate. 
You can check the records. I — ” 
“Under arrest. Alteration of 
program, illicit departure from 
building, undesirable harboring of 
countersocial tendencies. Orders 
to immobilize you immediately 
upon your return to building. Now 
carried out. Mandatory sentence 
of erasure to follow.” 

“Wait a minute. I have the right 
of appeal, don’t I?” 

“Case has already been consid- 
ered and referred to us for final 
disposition.” A note of inexorabil- 
ity in the policeman’s tone. They 
are at his sides now. He cannot 
move. Sealed within the hardening 
spray. Whatever alien microorgan- 
isms he has collected are sealed in 
it with him. To the chute? No. 
No. Please. But what else did he 
expect? What other outcome could 
there be? Did he think he had 
fooled the urbmon? Can you re- 
pudiate an entire civilization and 
hope to slip yourself smoothly 
back into it? They have loaded 
him aboard some kind of dolly. 
Dim shapes outside the cocoon. 
“Let’s get a detailed print of this 
on the record, boys. Move him to- 
ward the scanners. Yes. That’s it.” 
“Can’t I see my wife, at least? 
My sister? I mean, what harm will 



it do if I just talk to them one last 
time — ” 

“Menace to harmony and sta- 
bility, dangerous countersocial 
tendencies, immediate removal 
from environment to prevent 
spreading of reactive pattern.” As 
though he carried a plague of re- 
belliousness. He has seen this be- 
fore: the summary judgment, the 
instant execution. And never real- 
ly understood. And never imag- 
ined. 

Micaela. Stacion. Artha. 

Now the cocoon is fully hard- 
ened. He sees nothing outside it. 

“Listen to me,” he says, “what- 
ever you’re going to do, I want 
you to know that I’ve been there. 
I’ve seen the sun and the moon 
and the stars. It wasn’t Jerusalem, 
it wasn’t the Taj Mahal, but it 
was something. That you never 
saw. That you never will. The pos- 
sibilities out there. The hope of 
enlarging your soul. What would 
you understand about that?” 

Droning sounds from the far 
side of the milky web that contains 
him. They are reading him the rel- 
evant sections of the legal code. 
Explaining how he threatens the 
structure of society. Necessary to 
eradicate the source of peril. The 
words blend and mingle and are 
lost to him. The dolly begins to 
roll forward again. 

Micaela. Stacion. Artha. 

I love you. 

“Okay, open the chute.” Clear,

eter began to pulse brightly and, 
as it blinked on and off slowly, 
seemed to signal reserves of enor- 
mous power. He flipped another 
switch activating the sound mech- 
anism and a pulsing yellow light 
appeared. Tiredly he sat down on 
the bench and gazed at the black 
panels through unfocused eyes. 

“Twenty or so MTC. men are 
coming here tomorrow to give you 
a going over,” he finally said. “The 
board of directors of the Mini- 
tronics Communications Corpora- 
tion has decreed it’s about time 
you began to earn some money. 
The target date to make you oper- 
ational is a year from tomorrow. 
It will take some doing. There are 
great gaps in your memory, addi- 
tional circuitry should be installed 
and it ordinarily would take a full 
year before you were properly de- 
bugged. They also are considering 
removing your voice and putting it 
in storage until a money-making 
use for it presents itself. They 
don’t know it — but I will not be 
here tomorrow. In fact I will never 
be here again, so this conversation 
is something in the nature of a 
farewell. We might as well be for- 
mal about it. Now, good evening, 
Mr. Machine.” 

“Good evening, Clarence,” the 
machine replied in a pleasantly 
cultivated voice. 

“I am quite depressed this eve- 
ning. 1 don’t believe I could toler- 
ate levity or even friendliness. I 
would prefer to be called Mr. 



MacKay. Let’s begin again. Now, 
good evening, Mr. Machine. 

“Good evening, Mr. MacKay,” 
the machine said. The spoken 
word “now,” followed by a pause 
of three seconds or more had been 
chosen years before to alert the 
machine that a spoken response 
was required. No reason had ever 
arisen to change this arrangement. 

The events of the past few weeks 
had had a cumulative, deeply de- 
pressing effect on MacKay. It had 
begun when he agreed to have 
lunch with a total stranger — an un- 
usual thing for him to do — with a 
science writer for Tempus, the 
news magazine, the most offensive 
man he could recall ever having 
met. Questions of outrageous in- 
timacy had been put to him until 
he had dropped the bread he was 
buttering and stood up and an- 
nounced the interview at an end. 

The Tempus man had remained 
seated and had said, “Before we 
part, would you care to read your 
obituary? It usually has a bracing 
affect on a man. I’ve had it on file 
for years.” 

They had taken a taxi to the 
Tempus Building and a folder con- 
taining six typewritten sheets was 
taken from the file and handed to 
him. He read it standing near the 
doorway.

computer design. A moving 
force in the burgeoning sec- 
ond industrial revolution, 
MacKay was known to 
many colleagues as a man 
arrogant and imperious in 
manner and many had 
smarted from encounters 
with him in the day to day 
work of science. By the few 
who were close to him he is 
remembered for his personal 
loyalty and passionate hu- 
manism. 

Born in the cornbelt on a 
small Iowa farm he . 

T he key statement in any obitu- 
ary when it could be used. Im- 
plied that the system made it pos- 
sible for any slum child, any ghetto 
child, to be a success if he made 
the effort. It was a concept so 
deeply embedded in the mythology 
that it probably had been routinely 
included. To have been a farm boy 
was somehow superior and more 
exotic than being a newsboy now 
that farmers were only five per 
cent of the population. The re- 
mainder of the obituary was a re- 
markably accurate digest of his 
activities except, of course, for 
those completely apocryphal 
stories about him the year he lec- 
tured at Cambridge. They marked 
him as an eccentric but in a some- 
what flattering sense. 

“Didn’t read it myself until a 
few minutes before I left the office 
to meet you for lunch,” the Tern- 



pus man said. “I send about a doz- 
en names a year to research. Part 
of the job. 

“Journalistically speaking of 
course you realize, Professor, 
yours is an obit of small magni- 
tude. You are preceded in impor- 
tance by a hundred entertainers led 
by the current female incarnations 
of sex, by two hundred politicians 
and military heroes, fifty athletes 
and a growing number of murder- 
ers, hoodlums, gangsters and Ma- 
fia captains who during their life- 
time succeeded in making the front 
page. If your obit is used at all it 
will probably consist of the first 
paragraph you read. And there is 
always the chance that if the make- 
up department needs another col- 
umn-inch of space to fit in a tooth- 
paste ad you will die twice. You 
will die and your obit will be killed. 
Are there any misstatements? 
Would you care to amplify any of 
the statements made? I can assure 
you anything you care to say will 
be added to the record.” 

He had walked out without an- 
swering. The man had actually 
toyed with him. Made two false 
assumptions: one, that a Tempus 
staff man was invulnerable; two, 
that he had interviewed a defense- 
less academic. His behavior had 
been undoubtedly encouraged 
through the years by the men he 
interviewed who consciously or 
unconsciously tried to curry favor 
with him in the hope of being per- 
sonally mentioned in a favorable

manner in addition tg the subject 
at hand. Time to stop his motor. 
Should he bother with such a non- 
entity? Why not? It would make 
the world a slightly less unpleasant 
place. Simple matter to have MTC 
cancel its heavy Tempus advertis- 
ing schedule as long as the science 
writer remained on staff. He would 
find it wise to resign before many 
weeks passed. 

Have I in fact been arrogant? 
Perhaps I should stop referring to 
engineers as mechanics . 

It seemed to ruffle a lot of feel- 
ings. No, they were mechanics. 
Have I quite unaware, ridden my 
reputation? 

That attractive young sociology 
instructor, Columbine. Pinching 
her bottom. She had been startled 
then had swung her head up and 
neighed like a horse. Pleased. But 
the consequences could have been 
quite unpleasant. Saw her at work 
whenever he went to the library. 
Pitching for her Ph.D. Regiments, 
divisions, armies in libraries busily 
rewriting one another. Single orig- 
inal concept nourishment for a 
thousand scholars. What nonsense 
did she teach? One thing certain, it 
had strong humanitarian implica- 
tions. An infinite number of var- 
iables but still the social sciences. 
Science the new religion. 

Unusual name she had. Well his 
own name, Clarence, had become 
unusual and much used by fiction 
writers for comic or effete charac- 
ters. Fashion in names. Flux of 



life. Life unbearable without it. 
When they dubbed her did they 
know Columbine was the daughter 
of Pantaloon and the sweetheart of 
Harlequin? Name fit the subject. 
Her swaying hips as she walked 
along a delight to see. The vital 
force still alive in him. How would 
he be if he lived as long as Carl- 
son? Flying out to the west coast 
to honor Carlson on his eighty- 
fifth birthday. Carlson only mildly 
pleased. His beloved teacher but 
the love no longer returned. The 
fires completely out. 

H e should visit Ellington one 
more time before he went away. 
Had he done any further work 
with Don Juan? The urgent mes- 
sage to visit his laboratory. There 
were the five chimpanzees, all but 
one wearing miniature yellow plas- 
tic helmets like construction work- 
ers. Don Juan, with his construc- 
tion worker’s helmet tipped rak- 
ishly forward on its elastic bands 
to expose the terminals of two 
electrodes, was standing at a low 
table. He had a hard on. A platter 
of fruits and nuts was at his side. 
Don Juan quickly pressed the but- 
ton mounted on the table. 

“I’ve finally hit a sexual gratifi- 
cation center, this lower electrode 
pointing down to the brainstem,” 
Ellington said. “There’s sufficient 
visual evidence, but as a further 
check I sunk the other electrode 
to the midbrain reticular activating 
system and get the distinctive elec-

trical pattern of sexual activity. 
There seems to be no satiation 
point. When the current goes off 
every twenty seconds he immedi- 
ately presses the button and puts 
it on again. Its close to four hours 
now and he hasn’t eaten a thing. 
I’m going to leave the current on 
as long as he continues to react. 1 
hope I don’t damage him. 

“Well Clarence how are you? 
It’s been a long time since you’ve 
been here. I’ve missed you. When 
you used to drop in every week or 
so and sit there silently watching 
these mannikins for an hour or 
two at a stretch I always meant to 
ask if you thought you were learn- 
ing anything. I might as well have 
asked if you thought they were 
learning anything. All the time 
you were observing them they were 
observing you, with their brief, 
shy, sidelong glances. 

“Have you noticed I lost Jacko? 
Had to go. He was getting to be 
quite a young man and he was an 
extra male. I might have walked in 
here one morning and found a 
bloody riot had taken place. 
Chimps don’t ordinarily pair off 
and they are not sexually posses- 
sive, but it’s best to play it safe. If 
I were working with hamadryas 
baboons where each male requires 
a harem there would have been 
bloody riot and murder long ago 
just as there was at the London 
Zoo. Jacko is now at the Aero- 
medical Research Laboratory at 
Holloman Air Force Base in New 



Mexico. They’re going to train 
him to operate a few simple instru- 
ments and then shoot him into 
space with a television camera for 
a month voyage. They were very 
anxious to get Teddy because I 
have a pleasure and pain electrode 
in place. Put some pressure on me. 
I don’t say they abuse their ani- 
mals but I was put off by the ter- 
minology they use. What I call 
pleasure and pain centers they call 
reward and punishment centers. 

“Teddy,” Ellington called. A 
chimpanzee loped over and pressed 
his thin lips against his arm. Elling- 
ton lifted the helmet. “Notice I’ve 
used only one electrode for both 
the pleasure and pain points. I 
couldn’t possibly have used two. 
Moving this one just two one-hun- 
dreths of an inch switches it from 
point to point. I’ve got it strongly 
secured in the pleasure position. 
Pleasure and pain centers are fre- 
quently found this close together. 
It’s a frightful thing to activate a 
pain electrode. Teddy broke two 
front teeth biting the edge of the 
table. The pleasure circuit seems 
to be completely nonsexual. That 
is, Teddy would act just like Don 
Juan but with no indication of sex- 
ual activity.” 

He groped in his pocket and 
took out a penny and gave it to 
Teddy. “Run along now,” he said. 
Teddy went to the slot machine, 
inserted the penny and pulled the 
lever. A few peanuts dropped into 
his hand.

“I need help and I can’t get it,” 
Ellington continued. “Take Rosy 
over there. I’ve had two appetite 
electrodes in her hypothalmus for 
the past month now. One will 
make her eat compulsively and the 
other will cause an aversion for 
food. I’ve invited just about every 
gastroenterologist in town here. 
They come, and I hook up Rosy 
and put on my little show. They’re 
all amused to see her eating com- 
pulsively but not one of them is in- 
terested in putting in a few weeks 
of honest work. I’ve got to know 
what’s going on inside her. 

“And now I’m saddled with that 
pathetic little girl.” He pointed to 
a chimpanzee crouched motionless 
and staring in a corner. She was 
the only chimpanzee without a 
miniature construction worker’s 
helmet. “She was sent to me as a 
replacement for Jacko. The poor 
thing is an idiot. Down in the 
books as Elsie. I was able to trace 
her history. She was picked up by 
traders in Africa when she was 
still of nursing age and kept in a 
small cage alone for more than a 
year. The market fell off sharply 
when seven university primate cen- 
ters were established. Don Juan 
here is a Harvard man. The others 
come from Emory University. El- 
sie is an extreme example of what 
happens to countless thousands of 
children. No affection and stimu- 
lation early in life and some de- 
gree of reduced mental capacity 
seems inevitable. 



“Take off Juan’s hat? No, that 
would only distress him. They are 
just as much creatures of habit as 
we are. I’m the only man who uses 
them. The first chimp I worked 
with snapped off the terminal of 
the electrode swinging on the bar. 
It was a messy piece of business 
probing to remove the wire. I had 
to devise some sort of protective 
covering if I wanted to work with 
free-moving chimps. When you hit 
a good spot you don’t remove the 
electrode. You may never hit the 
same spot again. It wasn’t too dif- 
ficult to condition them to wear 
their hats . .” 

T^HE Tempus man had been a 
* triviality compared to the 
shock effect of seeing the full-page 
picture in Computer World of the 
MTC board of directors standing 
in front of the machine. There he 
was, ruthlessly revealed, a little old 
man. Dear God, a little old man. 
What had he seen in the mirror as 
he shaved each morning? What 
would the end be? Heart? Stroke? 
Cancer? Heart could be a nasty 
thing. That man from the Univer- 
sity of Pennsylvania after the meet- 
ing. Howling and crawling on his 
hands and knees half across the 
lobby of the hotel before he ex- 
pired. He had made provision for 
a situation such as cancer. There 
would be no perverted humanitar- 
ian prolonging of the experience 
until he was a drug-stupefied, 
whimpering vegetable.

A man spent decades dying. 
More than half his taste buds and 
sense of smell were dead. His 
brain was at least a quarter of a 
pound lighter in weight. The vital 
force on which all physical and 
mental creativity ultimately de- 
pended began to wane, in males at 
any rate, as early as sixteen years 
of age and only a flicker of it re- 
mained alive in MacKay. 

He would no longer arrange his 
schedules to be free in April and 
May to spend the springtime at his 
home in the Italian countryside. 
The beauty of the dawn hour and 
the clamorous small noises of life 
were no longer for him. His visit 
this last spring had been a harrow- 
ing experience. Heaven and earth 
had seemed wrapped in a blanket 
of silence. He could no longer 
hear the birdsong. Yes, the high 
notes went first. He had returned 
to New York in a few days. 

What was the rest of the dreary 
catalog for a man seventy-one 
years old? An obvious loss of 
muscular capacity. He breathed 
less air and yet needed more. The 
loss of efficiency in extracting the 
amount of oxygen he required was 
perhaps as much as fifty per cent. 
His heart pumped about a third 
less blood and took longer to re- 
cover from the exertion. His nerve 
impulses traveled slower and his 
reaction time was slower. Drive 
carefully. A third or more of the 
waste-eliminating nephrons of his 
kidneys were gone. Be abstemious. 



Drink with the young and suffer 
the consequences of a crashing 
hangover. That just about 
summed it up. Yet, he could not 
ignore the possibility that he might 
live as long as Carlson. 

Could sexuality conceivably be 
reduced to an electrical current of 
a fraction of one volt in a small 
neuronic circuit? And if compul- 
sive eating is caused by the func- 
tion or dysfunction of another 
neuronic circuit what happens to 
psychiatric concepts? The close- 
ness of the pain and pleasure 
points. It was a certainty there was 
some small degree of electrical 
leakage. If there were a slight in- 
crease in leakage at an early age 
wouldn’t it create a masochistic 
personality? What then happened 
to psychiatric concepts? In an 
overall sense could increasing 
leakage with age, and consequent 
cross-talk, be a cause of dotage? 
What a terrible thing to happen to 
a man. How would be know? Oli- 
ver Wendell Holmes of the Su- 
preme Court, who remained on 
the bench until his nineties, had 
friends pledged to tell him if he 
acted peculiarly. Wonderful man. 
Went to burlesque shows with a 
book. When the girls went off and 
the comics came on read book.

exploration of sex. The mail-order 
black silk stockings it would have 
been scandalous to wear in town 
carried in her bosom and put on in 
the fields. They had much free- 
dom. Her mother timid and per- 
missive, her father always travel- 
ing on his job as a manure spread- 
er. Respectfully known as a ma- 
nure spreader. Respected sales 
representative of large chemical 
firm, one of the first to manufac- 
ture fertilizers. The mounting 
strain of ethical considerations and 
finally his agonizing declaration 
that he could not marry her for 
years and it would be best if they 
did not see one another again. 
Foolish boy. That’s what she had 
said, that was all she had said. 
Foolish boy. Soon afterward she 
had left town and taken a job as a 
typewriter in Des Moines. The 
sweetness of the flesh in youth. 
Only in youth. Thrown away by 
youth. Realized by youth only 
years later when it was gone for- 
evermore. 

Had he really been arrogant? 
He should have dropped his open- 
ing statement to his seminars. To- 
gether with the two Cambridge 
stories it probably had made him 
something of a campus character. 

<< ri1 HIS is a seminar in commu- 
1 nications. Within these walls 
there will be no limitations to ex- 
pression. No words will be consid- 
ered forbidden, obscene or immor- 
al. I have no prepared lectures and 



very little hard information to of- 
fer you. I hope to learn from our 
discussions. I must tell you, how- 
ever, that I have a basic point of 
view which holds that reality — and 
the truth, whatever that may be — 
is humanly unknowable. We are 
readers of instruments and the 
bodily instruments of our senses. 
We will hold to be true any system 
of communication that serves a 
pragmatic purpose. In my own 
work I productively use two differ- 
ent and conflicting theories of 
light. They are both therefore true 
for me. Professional philosophers 
used to construct systems of reali- 
ty which were entertaining to read. 
Today our philosophers are all se- 
manticists, but they throw no light 
into the darkness. A leading Ger- 
man philosopher has recently pub- 
lished a book which is offered as 
■an exploration of what he calls 
“The Isness of the Whatness.” I 
do not recommend that you read 
it. Only one word of wide popu- 
larity will be forbidden in this sem- 
inar and that is “sophisticated.” A 
word which is commonly used to 
describe a personality trait, a piece 
of machinery, a technique and a 
woman’s brassiere is a corpse on 
the pathway to clarity of thought 
and requires a hasty burial . .” 
That side of beef from the Eng- 
lish department charging that he 
must hold himself morally respon- 
sible for what he had done. Pre- 
cisely what had he done? True, he 
had seen his thought translated in-

to hardware for the military. With 
a few servomechanisms the same 
thought could program the work 
of any factory and bring an end to 
drudgery if a man were not so 
much cheaper to buy than a ma- 
chine. 

Could he possibly be classed 
with that two hundred per cent 
American Hungarian physicist ap- 
pearing before a Senate committee 
and demanding the construction of 
more hydrogen bombs when an ar- 
senal already existed for kill and 
overkill twice over? A projection 
to the end of the coming decade of 
nuclear power stations worldwide 
showed enough plutonium as a by- 
product to make a thousand ele- 
mentary Hiroshima-type bombs a 
month. In thirty different nations 
a plaything in the hands of the 
most sadistic murderous animal 
on the face of the earth. The usual 
humanitarian fog, it can’t really 
happen, when it was glaringly ob- 
vious that it would happen. Invite 
them all to a meeting. Serve tea. 
Admonish them to behave like 
ethical, humanitarian, Christian 
gentlemen. He might well live to 
see the world die. Give the 
squirrels a chance at the evolution- 
ary process. The final product 
could hardly be worse. 

Why had he found it impossible 
to avoid a biotic approach to his 
work? The human brain was an 
exceedingly primitive and ineffi- 
cient instrument. The universal ro- 
manticism about it was nothing 



short of preposterous. Bare sur- 
vival and not improved communi- 
cation had guided its evolutionary 
development. It was subject to the 
constant turbulence of emotional- 
ity. Its memory was extremely 
limited and largely uncontrollable. 
It retrieved the simplest informa- 
tion in a most laborious manner. 
Yet, if he knew by what mechan- 
ism it screened the stimuli of its 
environment which otherwise 
would keep it in perpetual convul- 
sions the knowledge would be of 
tremendous value. 

D on JUAN was seated on a 
cushioned chair when he visited 
Ellington again late the next after- 
noon. Ellington looked haggard. 
Juan still had a hard on, was still 
pressing the button every twenty 
seconds. 

Man of the future. Dozen elec- 
trodes anchored to his skull. Wear 
hat if self-conscious. Pocket bat- 
tery and selector dial. Dinner

straint necessary. Like alcohol.

than we are. He’s got a bone in his 
penis. All primates have except 
man. How sad. I have a patient at 
the hospital I should be seeing 
soon. Poor chap had a brain tu- 
mor and now he’s dying of cancer 
of the stomach. Have to time my 
visits carefully. He delays his 
scheduled shot of morphine to be 
alert when I come. He looks for- 
ward to seeing me. He knows he’s 
a goner and he enjoys the elec- 
trode work. 

“I hit a memory point that’s a 
great pleasure to him despite his 
pain. Memory circuits are so vivid 
they are experienced as double 
consciousness. He is visiting his 
aunt and cousins on his twelfth 
birthday. They have a surprise 
party for him. He hears all the 
shouting and laughter. I left the 
electrode in place and hooked him 
up like Juan. He can enjoy his 
birthday party whenever he wishes. 
I am interested to see if the mem- 
ory fades or expands. 

“Why don’t you come with me? 
We’ll unhook Juan and wait a 
while to be sure he’s okay and then 
go to the hospital together.” 

“I think I’ll skip the hospital. 
I’ve been rather depressed lately,” 
he had told Ellington. “I dropped 
in to tell you I was going away 
soon and I don’t think I’ll be 
back.” 

“Where are you going?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“What will you be doing?” 

“I don’t know.” 



“What about your work?” 

“I don’t give a damn about my 
work. I reached an age some time 
ago when a man is likely to be- 
come aware of his own mortality, 
an intimate personal awareness of 
his inexorable dissolution. It can 
be a time of searching reassess- 
ment. My thoughts ran to the evi- 
dent truth that a man’s culture, 
with religious fervor, gives him 
values which he must accept un- 
questioningly or suffer severe pen- 
alties, even if those values are 
monstrous and brutalizing. All 
history seems little more than a 
continuous documentation of it. 
As for myself, I feel I had been 
given a contract for life, to sign 
without reading, which assured all 
my aspirations would prove bo- 
gus, and a shabby morality which 
guaranteed life would be joyless, 
sterile and malevolent. It’s prob- 
ably just a passing melancholia. 
I’ve had a few unpleasant experi- 
ences recently.” 

“You are in a bad way, Clar- 
ence,” Ellington said. “Why don’t 
you come around to my place this 
evening for dinner and a few 
drinks? My numerous family is 
enough to jar anyone into a differ- 
ent frame of mind, and you might 
find my kids more interesting to 
watch than the chimps . .”

tioned, since the day he was born.

ble to deprogram himself what, as 
a rational man, would he do with 
the time still left to him? Why not 
a Mediterranean cruise to think 
about it. Take a call girl along. 
How did one go about finding a 
call girl? What a country boy he 
was. MTC’s sales promotion man- 
ager of course. It had taken him 
years to realize the man was a 
part-time pimp. 

Oh, the time. He looked at his 
pocket watch. Still time to make 
it. A solid hour of Pearl White in 
the old silent movie. The Perils of 
Pauline. What a treat. It would 
bring him back to his youth. He 
hoped they hadn’t added a sound 
track. Piano music, yes. Piano 
music would be fine. The old si- 
lent movie house always had a 
piano player just as the whore- 
house had a piano player. The 
simile was apt. If he dozed off and 
were awakened by that hard-sell 
commercial and had to watch a 
man shaving a peach with an elec- 
tric razor he really wouldn’t mind. 
It would intensify the nostalgia. 

He got to his feet and raised his 
hand to the switches and then 
paused. 

“Now, by the way,” he said, “if 
by any chance they ask you about 
me tomorrow will you say I’ve 
gone to America?” 

“I will, Mr. Mackay,” the ma- 
chine said; 

He flipped the two switches and

the man’s secretary had finally left. Skiller snapped his briefcase shut. 
“I realize that our conditions of “Well, Dr. Ericson, I can’t add any

more to what I’ve said. Any other 
questions?” 

Ericson slowly leafed through 
the sheets of scribbled paper in 
front of him. His gray hair was 
tousled where he had kept running 
his fingers through it during the 
past hour’s conversation. He came 
to one notation on a well-covered 
sheet and ran his fingers through 
his hair again. 

“The BC-1 will invert a fifty- 
thousand-element matrix in ten 



milliseconds, it says here. I wish 
you could tell me why it can’t do 
anything simpler in less time than 
that. I just don’t like the idea of 
buying a black box.” 

“If I told you what was in the 
box or even let you look inside it, 
that would be the end of Parsys, 
Inc. All we have to sell is compu- 
tational capacity produced in a way 
that is highly proprietary. Anyway, 
all you really need access to is the 
peripheral equipment, the interface 



63 




between computer proper and ex- 
ternal input-output devices. You 
couldn’t service the mainframe if 
you wanted to. The computer ac- 
cepts 72-bit binary inputs, a thou- 
sand of them — and the same for 
outputs, all in parallel. Anything 
outside this information boundary 
is accessible; you can add your 
own devices if you wish, buy them 
from us or shop around for other 
sources. You can buy standard 
computers from our competition 
for input-output processing. 
We’re not trying to put anybody 
out of business — all we insist on is 
that we stay in business ourselves, 
profitably.” 

“All right, you said that be- 
fore,” Ericson said grumpily. “I 
don’t see how we can pass it up — 
or at least pass up a trial. A flat 
four thousand dollars a month, 
you say? And a minimum of one 
year and no bargaining?” 

“Correct. This is an adaptive 
machine and you won’t see it 
reaching its full capacity for that 
long.” 

“And you guarantee that it isn’t 
just full of graduate students with 
desk calculators?” 

Skiller merely smiled. 

Ericson stared at the upper left 
opposite corner of the room for 
a long moment, then stood up. 

“Done. Have it here in thirty 
days. We’ll need that long to meet 
the installation requirements, so 
don’t show up early. What do I 
sign?” 



He signed the sort of thing that 
people sign, and Skiller departed, 
swinging his briefcase jauntily as 
he went. 

Parsys, Inc. was located well 
out of the city, across a country 
road from a forest preserve, in a 
two-story building about a block 
square. The building still showed 
signs of newness; some of the sec- 
ond-story windows still had a few 
stickers on the glass and the area 
around the driveway was black, 
with just a speckling of grass 
shoots emerging into the spring 
sunlight. Skiller swung his car 
around the front driveway, past 
the entrance steps, and parked it 
more or less at random; sawhorses 
still blocked the entrance to the 
parking lot. As he went up the 
three broad steps to the door, Skil- 
ler took in the stone-and-glass of 
the building’s expanse and reflect- 
ed that to some people this would 
bespeak a lavish hand with funds, 
which it did. It reeked of money — 
but so far it was all someone else’s 
money. And that someone had a 
tendency to panic when the quar- 
terly payments were half an hour 
late and could descend at a mo- 
ment’s notice — since the last quar- 
terly payment was in arrears by 
a month so far — and declare that 
Parsys, Inc. would henceforth be 
devoted to light manufacturing. 

Oh, well, Skiller thought as he 
waited for the elevator. We now 
have a firm order and by this time 
next year well either be in business 



64 



GALAXY 




for good or in jail. Why worry 
about a matter of degree in such 
a clear-cut situation? 

The elevator never came, so he 
walked down to the basement level 
(the second floor was to have been 
ready for occupancy two months 
ago) and entered the main — or at 
least the only fully-equipped — of- 
fice and the middle of an argu- 
ment. 

L IZ CARTER was standing, a 
furious black-haired bundle of 
sex in an orange scrap of some- 
thing, in front of Farley Porter’s 
desk, both hands clenched around 
crumpled pieces of paper with typ- 
ing on them, saying, “ . that 
out, Farley, I mean it. Just quit it. 
Tm not one of your stupid gerbils 
and I haven’t got time for your — ” 
Skiller raised his eyebrows — “ . 
ing cute little games. Hello, Char- 
lie. The next time you want to flex 
your mighty brain go out in back 
and use it on something that will 
make us some money. I haven’t 
been paid for two months and all 
I need now is for some brilliant 
psychologist to get his kicks from 
— Charlie, you’re smiling. What 
happened?” 

“Sold. Thirty days. What’s Far- 
ley been up to now?” 

“Just look. Look at what I’ve 
been typing. He’s been working on 
me all morning and I was too busy 
to notice and now look. It’ll take 
me the rest of the day to get back 
to normal.” 



The pieces of paper were neatly 
typed but every other line stopped 
three inches short of the margin, 
giving an interesting scalloped ef- 
fect to the page when viewed at a 
distance. 

Farley leaned back in his swivel 
chair, focusing his eyes about a 
foot below Liz’ face. “Sorry, doll. 
I was just testing a theorem. Re- 
inforcement at the sequence level, 
converging to a very reliable bi- 
nary counter. I’ll bet on the last 
letter you didn’t miss the alterna- 
tion once and I’ll also bet that you 
got every word spelled right. No 
interference, see?” 

Skiller scanned the letter he was 
holding. “Right. Go teach it to 
BC-1. 1 sold one.” 

There was silence suddenly, and 
then a scrabbling from an adjoin- 
ing office. Perry Jackson rolled 
into view in his desk chair and 
made his brown face into some- 
thing like a pleased look. 

“Duh plantation am saved, 
boss?” 

Skiller dropped into his own 
chair and opened the briefcase on 
his desk. He extracted the order 
form and handed it to Liz who 
passed it around. Ericson’s signa- 
ture was bold and black at the 
bottom of the second page. 

Porter took off his glasses, pol- 
ished them and, after a glance at 
Liz put them back on. Liz sat 
down at her typewriter. Jackson 
rolled through the doorway and 
propped his feet up on a vacant

desk, folding his hands across his 
middle. Clearly, this was a Big 
Moment. 

“Uhm, did he read it all?” Por- 
ter finally asked. 

“We went over it for an hour,” 
Skiller said. “He agreed to every- 
thing.” 

“Security, too?” 

Skiller nodded. “And we have 
thirty days. How’s BC-1?” 

Jackson sighed. “Dumb. I put a 
third-order differential equation 
through last night and it just dis- 
appeared. No printout at all. And 
something has gone wrong with the 
filter unit — it smells. I tried a 
memory dump and it gave me 
72,000 ones. It’s lying to me.” 
Jackson looked vaguely pleased. 
“Somebody told it I’m colored.” 

Liz said, “Oh, funny.” She 
crossed her legs, glanced at the re- 
sult and put both feet on the floor 
again. “Well, let’s do something. 
Let’s you do something. I’m going 
out and buy a new dress. You’re 
all looking at me.” She plucked at 
the front of her orange scrap and 
hunched her shoulders. “Why is 
everybody so nervous? Isn’t this 
what we wanted?” 

Six eyes focused on her, here 
and there. She stood up defiantly. 
She twitched defiantly. 

Then she grabbed her purse from 
under her desk and said, “God 
damn you all, I thought it was a 
pretty dress,” started to cry and 
ran out of the office, slamming 
the door. 



There was a long moment’s 
silence. Then Porter let out a long 
breath. 

“Right. Now let’s think.” 
Jackson said, “Now she’s going 
to hate us.” 

“No,” Skiller said. “She would 
have had to come in nude tomor- 
row, trying to get someone to no- 
tice her. Now she doesn’t have to.” 
Porter said, “Let’s think. I’ve 
wasted the whole morning pulling 
her pigtails and trying to keep from 
jumping her right on her desk. I’m 
worn out. Let’s go argue with 
BC-1.” 

C- 1 occupied the center of what 
some day was supposed to be 
full of BC-ls, 2s, and so on. For 
economy only the overhead 
fluorescents in the immediate area 
of the computer were on. The as- 
sorted racks of electronic devices 
and the random tables covered 
with papers and the chairs scat- 
tered here and there made an is- 
land of brilliance and purpose in 
the center of the empty assembly 
room. The three men moved to an 
upright rack from which thick 
draperies of cables ran to a ten- 
foot cube in the center of the mess. 
Jackson flipped on some switches 
and pilot-lights sprang up. A line- 
printer went kachung and waited, 
humming. 

Jackson said, “All right, give 
me the reel marked ‘NG’ and I’ll 
show you.” He accepted the roll 
of tape, mounted it in a tape trans- 



66 



GALAXY 




port beside the rack, flipped loops 
between rollers and poked a few 
buttons. The reels spun briefly and 
stopped. “Ready.” 

At the rack, Porter pressed a 
button and from within BC-1 came 
a soft chiming sound. In about 
ten seconds, a red READY legend 
appeared on one panel of the rack 
and Porter pushed another but- 
ton. The tape reel began to spin, 
kept spinning for about thirty sec- 
onds and then stopped abruptly, 
the dangling loops oscillating to 
equilibrium. 

“We can’t have that smell,” 
Skiller observed. “Let’s knock out 
another panel and put in a second 
filter unit. How long has this one 
been operating?” 

“Oh, about — uh — ” Jackson 

paused, looking enlightened. “I 
don’t think it’s ever been changed. 
That’s about three months.” 

“Well, we service every month, 
so that should be all right, then. 
Is this the differential equation you 
were talking about?” 

Just then the line-printer began 
to go pup-pup-pup-pup and the 
paper flowed into the receiving bas- 
ket, folding itself neatly in a zig- 
zag. One hundred and eighty deci- 
mal characters per line, ten lines 
per second. 

Jackson said, “Of course this is 
only one printer channel; we should 
have received three more line-print- 
ers by now so we could check out 
at least four channels running in 
parallel, but this is a pretty close 



simulation. I have the system 
hooked up to a multiplexer sam- 
pling sixty-four output channels in 
rotation. It’s almost the same thing 
as parallel output. Hey, look, it’s 
data!” 

Skiller ran a finger down one 
column of numbers; they pro- 
gressed in an orderly way from 
one value to slightly larger or 
smaller values, as the solution to 
a continuous equation should. 
“Looks okay but is it right?” 

“Right, schmight,” said Porter. 
“They’re all working together and 
they’re computing — let’s take a 
look inside.” 

He flipped the line-printer off, 
stopping the flow of paper, and led 
the way to the other side of BC-1 
where a short ladder led up to a 
wooden platform five feet off the 
floor. They climbed up and Porter 
lifted a panel labeled “TO.” from 
the top surface of the cube, reveal- 
ing a three-foot-square aperture 
covered with semireflecting plas- 
tic. Gathering around, the three 
leaned their elbows on the frame of 
the one-way mirror and looked 
down into the brilliant interior of 
BC-1. 

A bustle of activity: tiers of cu- 
bicles with connecting corridors 
and ramps; tunnels and platforms; 
scurrying little brown and gray 
forms zipping from one place to 
another, sometimes dragging an 
inert form with them and some- 
times alone; other hunched head- 
foremost in the little cubicles, the 



READOUTTIME 



67 




bobbing of the backs indicating 
rapid and continuous little move- 
ments but giving no view of what 
was happening. 

“Watch,” Jackson said. “Right 
near the end of the program I’ve 
put in a long loop for exercising 
the whole input-output module at 
one time. Last night the critters 
got confused and they were all re- 
sponding to everything — that’s 
when I got all ones for the out- 
put.” 

Suddenly the whole bank of cu- 
bicles that was visible began a flur- 
ry of synchronized activity; a rip- 
ple of bobs began at one corner, 
traveled swiftly across one row, 
back down the next lower row and 
so forth, until within a few tenths 
of a second the disturbance had 
reached the extreme lower-left cu- 
bicle. Then the cycle began again 
at the instant it ended. 

“This is a 7200-unit module, and 
each unit is good for about a thou- 
sand bits, so we’ve got 7.2 mega- 
bits per cycle right now, poten- 
tially — this loop is giving the same 
context-address to everyone, so 
something like one percent of 
memory is being outputted. And 
I’ve got the peripheral computer 
checking the output, so it must be 
okay now. It sure wasn’t last 
night.” 

“Have you checked the redun- 
dancy? You couldn’t have if the 
module wasn’t working.” Porter 
suddenly pointed. “Never mind, 
there goes one now.” 



A squad of little brown and gray 
forms, looking like slightly under- 
sized shrews because that is what 
they were, scurried up a ramp on 
the input-output module and 
dragged a body out of one cubi- 
cle. Another animal squeezed into 
the cubicle past the body being ex- 
tracted and began bobbing up and 
down immediately. The others 
pulled the casualty down the ramps 
to the very bottom and disappeared 
through a small door. 

Porter said, “No alarm. Either 
the standby circuit is working or 
the alarm isn’t. But the cleanup 
squad showed up in plenty of time.' 
What’s the MTBF been running?” 

Jackson pulled out a pocket 
notebook and thumbed through 
it. “Mean time between failures — 
about twelve days now. Pretty 
good. You’ve just doubled it since 
we started. And I think they’re 
definitely smarter than they were 
eight generations ago. We might 
even try slowing the metabolism 
a little more.” 

“No go,” Porter said. “I’ve run 
into a problem there. The brains 
are getting larger and there’s a def- 
inite tradeoff between metabolic 
rate and keeping that brain in good 
shape. I still can’t tweak the one 
without something coupling into 
the way the next strand of RNA 
replicates, messing up the other. 

“But I still think we have a way 
to go before we run out of gains 
just from reorganization. Look at 
all that bobbing, for instance — 



68 



GALAXY 




that’s tiring and it doesn’t contri- 
bute to the output at all. They 
don’t have to do that — but it’s got- 
ten to be very popular, I see. May- 
be we have to work some more on 
their lower levels — make the stuff 
in the recreation room more sen- 
sitive, so they get used to bigger 
effects from less output. The strat- 
egy of reorganization has gotten 
awfully complicated, though — I’m 
afraid to tinker much more with 
this model.” 

They all straightened up, and 
Porter and Jackson put the panel 
back in place. BC-1, the first com- 
mercial biological computer, stood 
bukly and silent in its pool of light, 
as the three men fussed a bit more 
over the printer output, rewound 
the tape, cut the power to the peri- 
pheral machinery and left. Jackson 
was saying, “I don’t think there’s 
any such word as ‘gotten’ and you 
said it twice — ” as the door closed. 

I NSIDE BC-1 a one-hour shift 
was ending. Little gray and 
brown animals scurried up the 
ramps, climbed the tiers of cubi- 
cles in a wave, and others began de- 
scending. In less than half a min- 
ute the changeover was complete. 
The new set of animals stood 
alertly in their cubicles! Then the 
lights in the I.O. Module began to 
dim and these animals began to 
leave, too. The abandoned cubi- 
cles remained dark. In each were 
five tiny light-bulbs and a single 
spring contact which could be 



closed by a slight downward pres- 
sure. 

The holiday began, with much 
creeping about in mysterious dark 
passageways, much cavorting amid 
the levers and springs and wheels 
and games of chance in the recre- 
ation room; much frantic sex when 
it suddenly became possible; roar- 
ing good times in the juvenile 
mess-hall where the simplest and 
stupidest shrew could feast on 
things that tasted good, felt good, 
and wriggled good at no more ex- 
pense than operating an elemen- 
tary mechanism; and much lovely 
napping in dark private holes, one 
thousand to the cubic foot. The 
infinite universe, ten feet on a side 
fed, entertained, educated, pro- 
tected and contained its little 
brains, demanding only that of the 
million bits each could handily 
store just a thousand be reserved, 
and of the hundreds of actions each 
could control for twelve hours out 
of twenty-four only the special 
control of one or two actions for 
one hour out of four. Altogether, 
not a bad deal for animals whose 
primitive ancestors weighed a 
healthy 1/7 ounce, lived brief lives 
of hunger and anxiety and were 
possessed of entirely intolerable 
personalities. 

« ji COMPUTER,” Skiller was 

^ explaining a month later and 
elsewhere, “is really just a model 
of what we think a brain is, which 
is a model in the first place. What 



READOUTTIME 



69 




we’ve done is to stop making mod- 
els of models, and instead start 
making something like a collec- 
tion of properties that organizes 
itself into a model that produces 
the behavior we want. We don’t 
even think of it, among ourselves 
anyway, as a computer. It’s a 
bunch of self-organizing units that 
can change the way they control 
their individual inputs, indepen- 
dently and individually, so as to 
maximize whatever they need max- 
imized. All we do, all you do when 
you follow the programing instruc- 
tions, is to see to it that what these 
units have to do to get what they 
need can only be done by solving 
your problem on the way. We cre- 
ate an artificial set of rules, for 
example, that makes inverting a 
matrix a necessary means which 
these units must use to keep them- 
selves happy. They don’t know that 
what they’re doing is inverting a 
matrix, of course — no one of them 
performs any single action that 
could be called inverting a matrix 
— but when each of them lives by 
the rules we insert into its envi- 
ronment, all of them together end 
up inverting our matrix — or any- 
thing else we want them to do.” 
“That’s gobbledygook,” his fem- 
inine companion said. She was 
seated on a cushion across a low 
table from him and they were re- 
covering from an expensive dinner. 
His feminine companion was a 
functioning vice president in 
charge of engineering for a large 



automobile manufacturer, a per- 
son who could say yes or no to in- 
stallation of a BC-1, or a hundred, 
if she felt that it would save a dol- 
lar and a half per car, or fifteen 
million dollars per year. She was 
also quite attractive from most 
angles and had a smashing figure 
which she showed off to good ad- 
vantage by the simple strategy of 
leaving it uncovered from the 
waist, or somewhat lower, up. The 
last ten years had been a devastat- 
ing disaster to the textile mills, as 
Skiller had been discovering. 

“Uh — it’s what? No, it isn’t.” 
Skiller said. He had reached for 
his drink and become momentarily 
arrested in his train of thought. 
“Definitely not gobbledygook. 
Just a new idea, which is by defini- 
tion hard to express in terms that 
sound familiar.” 

“Perhaps I would understand 
you better, Charles, if you would 
tell me the principles behind the — 
thing, if you don’t want to call it a 
computer — you’re trying to sell 
us.” 

“Sorry,” said Skiller. “It’s bad 
for industrial relations but that’s 
the one thing I can’t tell you. As 
far as anyone else is concerned, 
we’re selling a computer with in- 
puts and outputs and specifications 
and a software manual which 
teaches you how to make it pro- 
gram itself. In five years, maybe 
less, you’ll know. We just want to 
take advantage of our priority 
while we can. You understand.”

“Oh, yes. I’ve taken advantage 
of many priorities while I had 
them — for heaven’s sake, go ahead 
and look. Don’t be furtive. This is 
a very delicate matter of style, 
and if you act old-fashioned I’ll 
just have to go and put something 
on.” 

Skiller sagged for a moment 
and threw up his hands — discreet- 
ly- 

“I can’t look and I can’t not 
look. There’s a girl in our office 
who was working up to this but 
she seems to have cracked before 
we did. Are you really just being 
in style, or were you — Well, for- 
get it.” He stood up, smiled and 
said, “Let’s say I’m old-fashioned 
and go get you something to put 
on — or get rid of the rest of it.” 

She gathered her things and 
stood to take his arm; she smiled, 
too, suddenly. 

“I like your idea better,” she 
said. 

Nothing was signed that night, 
despite exp29ration of a number of 
possibilities. 

S OMEWHAT after dawn the 
next day Skiller found himself 
shouting at Liz, who was a little 
more demurely attired but not 
quite enough to resolve the ques- 
tion of whether she was wearing 
anything underneath. “You know 
where we ended up? You know 
where we ended up! I’m going bat- 
ty! If the executives aren’t good- 
looking naked women their secre- 



taries are — and if their secretaries 
aren’t you know they haven’t got 
enough money to buy a god- 
damned computer! Nobody’s get- 
ting anything done any more ex- 
cept the queers!” 

Liz said somewhat stiffly. 
“You’re supposed to have a little 
self-control. It has nothing to do 
with sex. Women dress for other 
women.” 

“And undress for other men,” 
Skiller replied. “Well, it used to 
have something to do with sex and 
as far as I’m concerned it still 
does. That goes for you, too.” Liz 
hunched her shoulders. “And for 
Chcissake, stand up,” he added and 
left before anything worse could 
happen. As he went out he heard 
the telephone ringing and Liz, after 
a short delay, answering it, and 
then he had to go back in. 

“It’s a Miss Stengler,” Liz said. 

“Ther 

“Oh,” he replied and put the 
telephone to his ear while not look- 
ing at Liz. Let her listen. 

“Charles?” Her voice was quite 
neutral, considering. 

“Yes, uh, Peggy. Or — ” 

“I’m sending Mr. Abernathy 
over to your office to continue the 
discussion.” 

“Mr. Abernathy?” 

“Mister. He’ll have all his wits 
about him and all his clothes on. 
I’m telling him to order ten BC-1 
computers, or whatchmacallits, if 
he understands what you’re talking 
about. He can say no.”

“I’m glad,” Skiller said, “that 
there is still someone around this 
city who is concerned about the 
Gross National Product.” 

“There is. And don’t ever call 
me again — on business.” 

After a while Liz suggested, 
“Hang up,” so he did. “Well?” 
she said. 

“I’m trying to decide whether 
I’m being worked on. Does she 
love me for my computer or for 
myself?” 

“Don’t ask me.” 

“Don’t be annoyed. It’s just that 
now they want to talk about ten 
computers.” 

“You must have been terrific.” 
“And don’t be icy, either.” He 
looked at her thoughtfully. “I feel 
like a convict who’s just finding 
out that there are great silver birds 
in the sky. Have I been that much 
out of touch with things?” 

“Since I’ve been here, you have. 
And you usually smell like shrews 
— or you used to before you went 
out selling.” 

“I thought the uncovered look 
was just in places like Los Angeles 
or Boston. They’re all over — even 
at hamburger joints. Even teen- 
agers. Doesn’t anything — happen?” 
Liz shrugged. And stood up 
straight. “Sure. Sometimes.” 
“Sometimes?” 

“Well, why ask me? I don’t go 
around counting.” 

“In public, you mean?” 

Liz was beginning to look 
strange. “I suppose so — you al- 



ways see a few kids — I mean, we’re 
all healthy now, and you don’t 
have to have a — ” her voice dwin- 
dled away. 

“Baby. But don’t a lot of them 
have them anyway?” 

“Charlie, I don’t know. It just 
seems freer than it used to be. All 
right, it does have something to do 
with sex.” 

“I wonder,” Skiller said. A 
thought was forming far back in 
his awareness — and another phe- 
ndmenon was asserting itself, too. 
He was thinking, looking straight 
at Liz. Finally she simply reached 
up and unbuttoned the two top 
buttons of her blouse, settling the 
question as to what was under- 
neath, and finally he noticed. The 
thought submerged in favor of the 
phenomenon. 

A t noon he went into the ani- 
mal lab where Porter and Jack- 
son had been conveniently stuck 
shaping some young shrews. Por- 
ter and Jackson greeted the news 
about the order for ten computers 
with skepticism and gladly turned 
the job of shaping over to Skiller. 
They finally agreed that since there 
was a possibility of more orders 
they had better get into the city 
and prime their main suppliers — 
and also carry the news to the man 
at the bank, who was understand- 
ably interested even in rumors of 
solvency. Jackson and Porter de- 
parted. 

Skiller found that the initial

shaping had gone well. Early in 
training, the human operator had 
to make the rules bend a little 
whenever the animals did some- 
thing even partially like what was 
required, so that, for example, 
food would appear if the animal - 
even made a motion toward the 
bar it was supposed to press. The 
human operator had to make him- 
self a slave to the animal during 
this shaping phase. 

Now, however, the young shrews 
were well past the initial bar-press- 
ing phase and were learning the 
sequential aspects of the task, 
learning that if light A came on 
before light B there was no point 
in pressing the bar (experimental- 
ists even got a mild shock if neces- 
sary, to emphasize the futility), 
and that if B came on before A, 
something highly edible would ap- 
pear if the bar were pressed. This 
task was already straining the in- 
tellectual capacity of the shrews 
and from now on the complexity 
would not extend any higher; in- 
stead a desk-top computer would 
gradually add “sideways” to the 
task, adding more bits, essentially, 
without changing the kind of prob- 
lem. In effect, the operation codes 
of BC-1 were being defined. 

Finally Skiller was satisfied that 
the process could complete itself 
without his help. He went into the 
assembly room, passing the office 
on the way. He heard Liz typing 
and did not go in. 

The thought that had been at 



the back of his awareness was 
growing larger now and he went 
to BC-1 with a feeling of forebod- 
ing. His own behavior astonished 
him; surely the provocation . 

He dragged the wooden platform 
around to another side of BC-1, 
whick was now alone in the room 
and ready for delivery. He opened 
a different panel, this time having 
to unlock it; this one opened on 
the recreation room, actually a 
center in the computer which was 
concerned with only one thing: 
maintaining the training given the 
young shrews before they were 
introduced as replacements. He 
looked down into the space, this 
time dimly lit and full of shrews 
performing random-looking ac- 
tions. A partition across the center 
separated the males and the fe- 
males (they dutifully, one might 
say religiously, separated them- 
selves after each work period). 
Some of the levers in each half of 
the room made mutual access pos- 
sible and no shrew ever tried to 
mate except by this means. Shrews 
reproduce at a fantastic rate and 
in a protected environment would 
quickly overpopulate the entire 
computer, clogging it with unedu- 
cated animals. Training the ani- 
mals to restrict their mating to the 
recreation room was difficult but 
essential, for only by controlling 
the number of times per day that 
the access-panels would open could 
the population be kept at a reason- 
able level. A chief function of the

monthly servicing that was a man- 
datory part of the sales contract 
was to remove untrained young 
animals and replace losses with 
trained ones. 

S O SKILLER rested his elbows 
on the viewing-port frame and 
contemplated the knots of animals 
around that particular set of levers 
on both sides. Not many, not too 
few. Porter regulated the RNA, 
as best he could with the unsatis- 
factory techniques available, so 
as to keep the drive for reproduc- 
tion just low enough to be satis- 
fiable in the recreation room,with- 
out accidentally destroying the in- 
creased intelligence, small size and 
longevity which were essential to 
the main purpose of BC- 1 . 

Skiller brooded, however, not 
over this sexual situation, even 
though the parallel with his own 
recent experiences was unsettling, 
but over a larger picture. The en- 
tire recreation room consisted of 
only two types of objects: passive 
ones, which were immovable and 
served mainly as places to stand 
or things to hide behind, and active 
ones; levers and wheels and yield- 
ing obstacles, each one of which 
caused something to happen that 
research had proven was important 
to a shrew. Anything that the 
shrews could affect in any way re- 
acted in turn, through circuitry 
and devices in the walls of the 
computer, to do something that 
mattered to the shrews. Each 



shrew, therefore, learned to control 
the wheels, levers, and yielding 
obstacles so as to receive the wa- 
ter it needed, the special foods it 
delighted in, the sex it wanted, the 
kind of light or dimness it craved 
at the moment, or in a word all 
the inner conditions that consti- 
tuted its own inherited definition 
of good living — of survival. Since 
the rules connecting what the 
shrews did to what they received 
in return were indentically the op- 
erations of the computer, the 
shrews learned to do these things, 
to respond to disturbances of spe- 
cial sorts, by performing the ac- 
tions that were the bases of ele- 
mentary computational processes. 
If one light comes on, the left bar 
must be pressed to get food. If 
two lights, the right bar. If three 
lights, both. That is nothing more 
than one-bit binary addition with 
carry. Every shrew in the Arithme- 
tic Module could perform, if nec- 
essary, five-bit addition, parallel- 
in, serial out, and there were usu- 
ally about 500 animals in this 
module. One hundred twenty-five 
bit additions could therefore be 
performed at once if the problem 
required it. Furthermore the sys- 
tem was self-reorganizing; it would 
modify its own operation codes 
until the specified result was pro- 
duced. All that was needed was the 
proper progression of changes in 
the rules — in the properties of the 
environment in which the shrews 
lived. It was all in the program-

GALAXY 




er’s manual — in gobbledygook, 
of course. 

And that is what went through 
Skiller’s mind as he watched the 
small forms moving about among 
the devices in the divided recrea- 
tion room. He was thinking about 
the whole environment of his 
shrews, watching how they mas- 
tered it and kept it under control, 
without ever knowing why doing 
this or that resulted in the conse- 
quences which were so delightful. 
The “why” was concealed in the 
walls and floor, into which the 
shrews could not see and which 
would have meant nothing to them 
if they could have looked. 

So I do what feels good, Skiller 
thought, and so do the rest of 
them. I do things and get good feel- 
ings back, and what happens be- 
tween I have not the slightest idea. 
That’s why I don’t like what’s been 
happening. I don’t understand what 
changed the rules, or even what 
really changed, which seems to me 
like a change in the rules. Some- 
thing has happened that affects 
me very personally and I have no 
control over it. I can only change 
the way I respond, so as not to be 
embarrassed or miss something. I 
have learned by rote and I relearn 
by rote. Where is understanding? 
It is not possible. It does not exist. 

H e was still there when Porter 
and Jackson returned. The bank 
was ecstatic. The suppliers were 
suspicious. In the middle of Jack- 



son’s review of the suppliers’ de- 
mands for surety, mainly money, 
Skiller said, “I’m sorry, can we go 
into that tomorrow? Farley, I want 
to have a look at the RNA lab. I 
have an idea.” 

“Sure, if it’s important,” Por- 
ter said and led the way. 

The RNA lab was mostly a 
machine for the automatic sequen- 
tial decoding of long protein mole- 
cules by brute-force application of 
simple steps over and over with- 
out mistakes, night and day. This 
machine formed part of a feedback 
loop for an RNA synthesizer, 
which was capable of making sys- 
tematic changes in existing RNA 
molecules. The operation of this 
servo was extremely slow, conver- 
gence to a specified molecule re- 
quiring at times several months, 
but sometimes it worked and some- 
times the specified changes were 
accomplished without lethal side- 
effects on other parts of the 
chains. The remainder of the lab 
was a nice set of microsurgery 
tools, whereby the altered mole- 
cules could be implanted in a de- 
nucleated ovum, which sometimes 
developed into a shrew having 
new characteristics vaguely resem- 
bling what was wanted. 

“Okay, what?” Porter asked 
when all three were in the lab. 

“Can you unravel RNA in hu- 
mans with this thing?” 

“Naturally. But so far nobody 
has been able to decode most of 
it.”

“I know that. What I want to 
know is — could you use this thing 
to make human RNA into some 
other form without making some- 
thing nonhuman at the same time?” 
“That’s impossible to say. 
We’ve unraveled a fair part of the 
human code — others have — but 
it seems that there are a lot of 
characteristics beyond the ordin- 
ary mental and physical ones we 
know about. At least there’s a lot 
of code left after we think we have 
accounted pretty well for every- 
thing we do know about. But you 
know as well as I do that tinker- 
ing with human RNA that way is 
definitely naughty — death penalty 
and all that. You aren’t mad at 
me, or something?” 

“No. But I have reason to won- 
der what all those other parts of 
the human RNA code say. You 
say that most physical and mental 
characteristics have been traced. 
What is the rest for?” 

“I said I don’t know. You’re 
not being very obvious.” 

Skiller suddenly sat down at a 
desk; he laughed briefly. “No, I’m 
not. Look, what I’m thinking 
about is really way ahead of our 
game — but think about this. Sup- 
pose we could crank up your gad- 
get to put in some extra RNA 
links in your shrews that don’t af- 
fect their heredity. Possible?” 

Porter grew more interested. 
“Hey — you know what? I don’t 
know. I don’t think it’s ever been 
tried. Do you mean — ” 



“I mean we could stop having 
to share memory capacity with 
the systems in the shrews that are 
already using the existing code 
structure. We could give every 
damned one of them a billion ex- 
tra bits of storage capacity.” 

“But how would you read it 
out? If it isn’t part of the existing 
code, the existing systems couldn’t 
utilize the storage space and you 
couldn’t put in a read-only mem- 
ory for permanent instructions. 
You’d have to grind their brains 
up—” 

Porter suddenly became agitated 
and went on in a new tone of voice. 
“By god, all you’d need would be 
a super-duper RNA reader, and 
you could get the readout from 
the casualties! A billion bits? A 
billion billion!” 

Jackson broke in. “But the su- 
per-duper RNA reader?” 

Porter said, “All right, we 
haven’t got one. We haven’t really 
pushed the reader because the 
bottleneck is the synthesizer. But 
if all we want to do is read, then 
maybe we could go into parallel 
operation — maybe we could make 
BC-1 operate a thousand parallel 
readers — why, we haven’t even 
thought of the possibilities. Char- 
lie, this may blow up in the morn- 
ing, but right now I like it. I do 
like it very much.” 

Skiller was abruptly different. 
“Well, Farley, I just wanted to 
know what you think. You guys 
go on home now; I’ll stay here and

see that BC-1 closes down proper- 
ly.” In five minutes they had left 
and Skiller went back to BC-1. 
Liz was still typing, probably try- 
ing to get her margins even again. 
He smiled, and then unsmiled as 
he entered the assembly room. 

A man can drive himself crazy 
supposing. Charles Fort probably 
did; I wonder if I was named for 
him. I’m driving myself nutty 
right now. All because I have 
spent ten years developing the 
world’s first biological computer

feeling left out and inept or some- 
thing. No, not inept, that’s for 
sure. Too ept, if anything. Too 
suspiciously ept, as if I have sud- 
denly turned into somebody else. 
The rules have changed. WHY? 

He undid the panel over the 
recreation room again. Suppose, 
he thought. Suppose I had the su- 
per-duper RNA reader, and sup-

pose I had a real dilly of a prob- 
lem, like “why”, or “what for" or 
something else that might take 
ten thousand shrews ten thousand 
generations to solve. Suppose we 
got to the stage where a billion 
bits, or a billion billion bits, was 
just a drop in the bucket — what 
godawful problem would need that 
much storage? Who could we sell 
such a memory to? Nobody could 
even state a problem that would 
need that much storage to hold 
the answers. 

But down there are the shrews, 
some of then — quite a few — lined 
up at those special levers. We 
ought to call this section the 
whorehouse. There they are, living 
their lives in a rather nice environ- 
ment, containing all that shrews 
are known to need and probably 
a lot of luxuries as well; it’s got 
everything we even suspect that 
they like, and all they have to do 
to get it is push a few pieces of 
environment around a little. They 
don’t know why pushing here re- 
sults in something good there, 
but they learn the rules; they know 
what to do. They have perfect con- 
trol over their own inputs. But 
they do the controlling our way. 
The way that solves our problems, 
while they are solving their own 
tiny elementary ones. 

Skiller sighed in disgust at him- 
self, but his mind kept churning. 
Suppose! What a waste of time, 
but still, suppose. Suppose we were 
reaching the end of the computa- 



tion, and the time was drawing 
close for final printout. It’s been a 
big problem, and there will be a 
horrendous amount of output 
generated, intermediate results 
that must be stored, new conver- 
sion programs, reference tables to 
be generated. We’ll just run out of 
storage space long before the final 
data are generated. We look down 
on our shrews, and realize that 
there just aren’t enough of them. 
What do we do? Why, it’s simple. 
We tinker with the RNA a little, 
up the drive, and change the rules 
connecting the levers to the little 
doors so that they open more of- 
ten. We drop the price at the 
whorehouse. In a little while sta- 
tistics will provide up with all the 
storage we need. 

Skiller heard the assembly-room 
door open and close, and then soft 
footsteps approaching. Very soft. 
He was suddenly filled with a feel- 
ing that was almost panic, and he 
continued staring down into the 
recreation room, watching the 
levers go. The footsteps ap- 
proached very close, and then Liz 
spoke. 

“Charlie?” 

“Just a minute, Liz.” He did 
not turn around. He felt that he 
knew what she was going to say 
and in a second she said it. 

“Charlie, don’t you want to — 
look at me?” 

Eventually, of course, he 
couldn’t help it, then or ever again.

down the ramp to the street. He 
flung a curse after it. 

He eased his head out between 
the parked cars before sprinting 
across the traffic lane of the park- 
ing lot to the elevator on the oth- 
er side. The attendant rushed to 
him, tried to demand the $30 daily 
fee, stepped back when Davis 
flashed his Traffic Manager’s 
badge at him. The attendant 
dropped to his knees in salute, 
stayed down while Davis rushed 
past. 

His office was on the ground 
level of the Roads and Traffic 
Building and when he came off the 
elevator, the hall was full of dust 
and a jack hamer was going crazi- 
ly at one end of it. The man be- 
hind it was wearing the light blue 
of Road Construction Unlimited. 
Davis remembered the spur route 
of the 2nd level, 57th Street West 
that was going through the build- 
ing’s corner. He hadn’t expected 
construction to start this soon. 

One wall had been ripped out of 
the office and the derricks were 
swinging the steel girders for the 
spur route into place. More men 
were driving them into the con- 
crete of the floor, slamming them 
into place with magn-gun rivets. 
One of the drivers kept walking 
to the water cooler and Davis 
stopped him. 

“That stuff is three dollars a 
gallon, buddy,” he said. 

“Road crew, Mac.” The big 
man tried to push him aside and 



Davis flashed the badge. 

“This is still my office, he said. 
He crossed to the control board, 
buzzed the Director. 

“Davis in,” he said. 

I suppose the old bastard will 
want a report already. 

“Right,” the Director’s secre- 
tary said, “I’ll tell him.” 

Leingen waved at him from the 
casualty table and he trotted over, 
flashed the badge and Leingen 
nodded. He was off duty now, of- 
ficially relieved — and he looked re- 
lieved. 

Lucky bastard will be home in 
three hours — if he makes it .. 

The casualty report was hor- 
rendous, up 4.2% over the day be- 
fore — with 17 dead on the United 
Nations area overpass alone. He 
dialed Road Service. 

“Road,” the voice on the other 
end said. 

“Traffic Manager. Send a bird. 
I’m going up for a look.” He 
checked some of the other reports 
— two breakdowns on the fifth 
level of the Tappan Zee bridge, 
both ’79 Fords. Goddam people 
had no right driving two-year-old 
cars on the roads anyway. He 
buzzed Arrest Division. 

“All ’seventy-nine Fords off the 
roads,” he said. 

“Rog.” On the board he 
watched, the red dots that were the 
Fords being shuttled off to the 
waiting ramps, clogging them. He 
flipped a visual to one of them, 
saw the cars jamming in and the

bulldozers pushing them closer. 
The din around him was increas- 
ing and pieces of plasta-plaster 
were starting to fall from the ceil- 
ing. 

“Slap up a privacy screen,” he 
ordered. He received no answer 
and looked at one of the workmen 
driving the rivets for the girders. 
Jones wasn’t there, he thought 
suddenly. Of course not, that gird- 
er is where his desk was. He’d miss 
Jones. 

“That ain’t a priority job, bud- 
dy,” the workman said. “You 
want materials, get ’em from 
Construction.” 

D avis growled, checked his 
watch. 0807. Things were just 
moving into the third rush period. 
Almost on cue the building began 
to quiver as the lower echelon of- 
fice workers hurtled by in their 
Lincolns and Mercuries to ob- 
scure little jobs in obscure little of- 
fices. 

A short buzz came from the 
main phone. The Director. 

“Yes, sir,” Davis said. 

“Davis?” the palsied voice said. 
Die, you old bastard, Davis 
thought. “Casualties are up all 
over.” 

“The roads are jammed, sir.” 
“You’re Manager. Do some- 
thing.” 

“We need more roads. Only you 
can authorize em.” 

“We don’t have any more roads. 
But that traffic must move. Do 
what you have to.” The voice went 



into a coughing spasm. “When 
you’re Director, you build roads.” 

“Yes, sir.” He punched off. All 
right, he’s move the traffic. Say 
this for the Director — he’d back 
a Manager all the way. 

“The bird’s here,” the intercom 
said. 

“Smith,” Davis said. His assis- 
tant looked up from the main 
board. “You’re in charge. I’m go- 
ing up.” He moved to the elevator, 
bounced up, flipped his telecorder 
to audio, caught the information 
as he hurtled toward the tenth 
floor. 

“Major pileup at Statue of Lib- 
erty East,” the speaker barked. 
“Seventeen cars and a school bus. 
Ambulance on the scene. Struc- 
tural damage on Fifth level East, 
Yankee Stadium Speedway. More 
accidents on Staten Island One, 
Two, Four, Ten, Thirteen, and 
Twenty-Two; East Side Four, 
Nine, and Eleven — ” Davis 
punched off. Matters were worse 
than he had thought. 

On the fifth floor he changed 
elevators to avoid the ramp from 
the exact-change lane to the fourth 
level, zipped to the roof and the 
waiting helicopter. 

“Fifty-car pileup on Yankee 
Stadium Four,” the helicopter 
radio screamed and he punched 
the button to Central. 

“Davis.” 

“Yes, sir?” 

“What’s the time on next of kin 
identification?” he asked.

“Twenty-three minutes, sir.” 
“Make it nineteen. Inform all 
units.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Lift off,” he growled at the pi- 
lot. He threw his eyes out of fo- 
cus, watching the cars hurtling by 
the edge of the roof. 

I could reach out and touch 
them — and have my arm torn off 
at 100 miles an hour . 

He coughed. He always forgot 
to don his gas mask for the short 
trip from the elevator to the bird 
aiid it always bothered his lungs. 

The smog was fortunately thin 
this morning and he could see the 
gray that was Manhattan below 
him. Southward he could make 
out the spire of the Empire State 
Building rising forty stories above 
the cloverleaf around it and be- 
yond that the tower of the Trade 
Center and the great hulk of the 
parking lot dwarfing it. 

“Hook right,” he ordered the 
pilot, “spin down along the river.” 
There was a pile-up at the Pier 
90 crossover and he saw a helicop- 
ter swooping down to pick up the 
mangled cars at the end of a mag- 
net, swing out across the river to 
drop them into the New Jersey 
processing depot. 

H e buzzed the Director as he 
saw the wrecks piling up in 
front of the three big crunchers at 
the depot. They were hammering 
broken Fords and Buicks into 
three-foot lumps of mangled steel. 



spitting them onto the barges. The 
barges were then being towed out 
to Long Island Sound for the new 
jetport. But fast as the crunchers 
were, they were not fast enough. 
With a capacity of only 200 cars an 
hour apiece, they could not keep 
pace with the rush-hour crackups. 

“Yes, Davis,” the Director 
wheezed. 

“Would you call U.S. Steel,” 
Davis asked. “We need another 
cruncher.” 

“Well, I don’t know if we really 
do— but I’ll call.” 

Davis punched off angrily. 

His practiced eye gauged the 
flow of traffic on the George and 
Martha Washington Bridges. The 
cars were eighty feet apart and he 
ordered a close to seventy-two, ef- 
fectively increasing the capacity by 
ten per cent. That was almost as 
good as another level — but not 
good enough. 

The traffic lane above the piers 
was packed and smoke from ships 
was rising between the two twelve- 
lane sections. Trucks loaded with 
imports paused for a moment at 
the top of the ramps were steam 
catapulted into the traffic. He saw 
one truck, loaded with what 
looked like steel safes, hit by a 
Cadillac, go out of control, hur- 
tle over the edge of the roadway 
and fall one hundred feet — five 
levels — to the ground. The safes 
went bouncing in every direction, 
slamming into cars on every level. 
Even two hundred feet above the 



82 



GALAXY 




scene he could hear the scream of 
brakes and the explosions as the 
autos crashed and burned. He 
punched for Control. 

“Scramble an ambulance to 
Pier Forty-six, all levels,” he said. 

He smiled. It was always good 
to be the first to report an acci- 
dent. It showed you hadn’t fot- 
gotten your training. He had re- 
ported four one morning, a record. 
But now there were bounties for 
accident reporting and it was rare 
when a traffic man could actual- 
ly turn one in. At one time traffic 
accidents had been reported by the 
police, but now they were too busy 
tracking down law violators. An 
accident was harmful only in that 
it broke the normal traffic flow. 

Traffic was heavy on all levels, 
he saw — he could actually see only 
three levels down and there were as 
many as eight below that — and the 
main interchange at Times Square 
was feeding and receiving well. The 
largest in Manhattan, it spanned 
from 42nd Street to 49th and from 
Fourth to Eighth Avenues. There 
had been protests when construc- 
tion had started — mostly from 
movie fans and library fanatics — 
but now it was the finest inter- 
change in the world, sixteen lanes 
wide at the 42nd Street off ramp, 
with twelve exact change lanes. 
Even the library fans were ap- 
peased, he thought: it had been his 
idea to move the library lions from 
the old site — they would have been 
destroyed with the rest of the 



building had he not spoken — to the 
mouth of the Grand Central speed 
lane to Yankee Stadium. 

The helicopter banked, headed 
down the West Side parkway to- 
ward the Battery interchange and 
the Statue of Liberty crossover. It 
had been clever of the design engi- 
neers to use the Bedloe’s Island 
base of the statue for the crossover 
base — it had saved millions over 
the standard practice of driving 
piles into the harbor water. The 
copper had brought a good sal- 
vage price, too. 

Of course, the conservationists, 
the live-in-the-past-people, had ob- 
jected here, too. But, as always, 
they were shouted down at the pro- 
test meetings. The traffic had to 
roll, didn’t it? 

Below the helicopter Manhattan 
was a seething mass of speeding 
cars — reds, blacks, blues, and this 
month’s brilliant green against the 
background of concrete and as- 
phalt. There were quick flashes of 
brake lights, frightened blurs as a 
tie rod snapped or a tire blew. Dip- 
ping wreckocopters swooped in to 
pluck cars and pieces of cars from 
the highways before the lanes jam- 
med. The island was 200 lanes wide 
at the top, widened to 230 at the 
base with the north-south lanes 
over the sites of the old streets run- 
ning forty feet apart, over, under, 
and even through the old buildings. 
It was the finest city in the world, 
made for and by automobiles. And

day anyway, the destiny of those 
automobiles. He felt the sense of 
power he always had here in the 
helicopter, swooping above the 
traffic. It passed quickly — it al- 
ways did — and he was observing 
clinically, watching the flow. 

“There,” he said to the pilot, in- 
dicated the fifth lane on the pier 
route. A dull red Dodge was going 
sixty-five, backing up the traffic 
for miles. There was no room to 
pass, and, with the traffic boiling 
up out of the tunnels and bridges 
onto the road, a jam was inevita- 
ble. “Drop,” he ordered, moved 
behind the persuader gunsight, 
lined the Dodge in the cross hairs. 

He fired and watched the result. 
The dye marker smashed on the 
Dodge’s hood, glowed for a mo- 
ment. Warned, the driver moved to 
a sane 95. But the dye stayed and 
the driver would be picked up lat- 
er in the day — the dye was impos- 
sible to remove except with Traf- 
fic-owned detergent — and sen- 
tenced. For first clogging, the fine 
was only $200, but for later of- 
fenses, drivers were banned from 
the road for five to 100 days, 
forced to ride the railways into 
town. Davis shuddered at the 
thought. 

Battery Point and Bedloe’s Is- 
land looked good and the copter 
heeled. He used the binoculars to 
check the Staten Island Freeway, 
saw that it was down to sixteen 
lanes coming into New York from 
the high of twenty-two. The main 



rush was almost over and he could 
start preparing for the early lunch 
rush. 

T^HERE was still a pile up at the 
Trade Center. The one tower, 
two had been planned, was stand- 
ing high above the highways 
around it, with the great bulk of 
the parking lot building rising 
above it, the smog line lapping at 
the seventy-ninth floor. He saw 
the red lights in the first 92 floors 
of the lot signifying full, knew that 
the remaining 40 floors would not 
take all of the cars still piling in 
from the twenty-five feeder lanes. 
He buzzed Control. 

“Yes, sir?” the voice said. 

“Davis. Get me Parks and Play- 
grounds.” 

“Parks and Playgrounds?” The 
voice was incredulous. 

“Right.” He waited and when a 
voice answered, spoke quickly, did 
his best to overpower the man on 
the other end. 

“Traffic Manager Davis,” he 
snapped. “I want Battery Park 
cleared. I’m preparing to dump 
two thousand cars there in five 
minutes.” 

“You can’t—” 

“The hell I can’t! I’m Traffic 
Manager. Clear the park — ” 

What there was left of it — the 
grass fighting for air against the 
exhaust fumes, dying in the shad- 
ow of the interchange above it, 
stomped to death as the millions of 
city dwellers flocked to the only

green in eleven miles — Central 
Park had been a bastion for a long 
time but it was too open, too con- 
venient. It was buried now under a 
rising parking lot and seven levels 
of traffic. As a concession to the 
live-in-the-pasters the animal cages 
had been placed on the parking lot 
roof and stayed there for two 
weeks until they had been hit by a 
drunk in a Lincoln. There had been 
a minor flap then with the carbon- 
monoxide drugged animals prowl- 
ing the ramps until they had been 
hunted down by motorcyclists. 

“What about the people?” Parks 
and Playgrounds asked. 

“Sorry about that. They have 
four and a half minutes.” He 
punched off, buzzed Beacons and 
Buzzers. 

“Davis,” he said. “Re-route 
Battery Five, ramps two through 
ten, into Battery Park.” 

“Right.” He buzzed Lower 
City, ordered Wall Street closed 
for seven blocks. Later in the day 
they’d have to reroute the traffic 
around it. No matter, the tie-up 
lasted for four hours anyway. 

The big pile-up, as always, was 
at the Empire State building where 
the main north-south curved 
twelve lanes out of the way to 
avoid the huge building. And, as 
they curved, tires skidded on the 
pavement, cars clawed to the side 
and, day after day, car after car 
lost control on the corner, went 
plunging over the side to shatter 
on the ramps below. It was, in 



many ways, the best show in town 
and office workers crowded the 
windows to watch the cars spin out 
of control. Today the traffic 
looked almost good and he 
clocked the pack at 110 on the 
corner, 115 coming out of it. Still 
not good enough, though — they 
were braking coming into the cor- 
ner, losing time, and the line was 
thin as they came out of it. He 
watched a Buick skid, hit the 
guardrail, tip, and the driver go 
flying out of the convertible top, 
land in the level below, disappear 
in the traffic stream. The car rol- 
led, plummeted from sight. 

“Home,” he said. The helicopter 
dropped him on the roof and he 
gagged against the smog, trotted 
to the elevator, dropped. The 
building was shaking from the traf- 
fic noise and the hammering of 
rivets. He coughed on the dust. 

H e checked the casualty 
lists, initialed them. Above 
normal, with the Empire State sec- 
tion running 6.2% ahead of last 
week. He was listed as reporting 
the pier pile-up, and there was a 
report stating Battery Park was 
filled — there was also a note say- 
ing that the Director was catching 
hell for parking cars there. To hell 
with him, Davis thought. There 
was another complaint to his at- 
tention from Merrill Lynch, 
Pierce, Fenner and Agnew. Two of 
their board members were caught 
in the Wall Street jam and were

late for work. He threw it into the 
wastebasket. Outside (inside?) — 
hard to say with no wall on one 
side of the building — the workmen 
were throwing up the steel plates 
for the ramp, stinting on the bolts 
to save time. 

“Put the damn bolts in,” Davis 
roared. “That thing will shake 
enough anyway.” 

The din was tremendous even 
now, with seven ramps of traffic 
passing within thirty feet. It would 
be worse when the spur route was 
finished. He hoped that they would 
put the wall back on the office. He 
buzzed Smith, asked for a readout 
on the Empire State complex. 

“Fourteen fatalities since nine 
o’clock.” 

It was now 10:07 and the pre- 
lunch rush was due to start in four 
minutes. 

“Damn Empire anyway,” he 
said. The United Nations inter- 
change board went red and he went 
to visual, saw a twelve-car pileup 
on the fourth level, the bodies and 
pieces of bodies, the cars and 
pieces of cars falling into the Gen- 
eral Assembly. Damn! he could 
expect another angry call from the 
Secretary General. Damn foreign- 
ers anyway, when did they get the 
idea that their stupid meetings 
were more important than traffic? 

The red phone rang — the Di- 
rector — and he lifted it. “Davis.” 

“Everything’s running higher,” 
the Director wheezed. “What’s the 
story?” 



“Empire’s the big tie-up,” Davis 
said. “That and some construc- 
tion.” 

“Do something. I gave you the 
authority.” 

“Get rid of Empire,” Davis 
said. “Get another forty decks on 
the Trade parking lot, too.” 

“Can’t be done.” The hell it 
can’t, Davis thought. You’re just 
afraid of the conservationists. 
Coward. “Do something.” 

“Yes, sir.” He waited until the 
phone clicked dead before he 
slammed it down. He took a deep 
breath of the air in the office — it 
was even better than smoking. 
Then he began to bark orders over 
the All Circuits channel. 

“Scramble another ten wreck- 
ocopters,” he snarled. With half 
again as many copters, wrecks 
would be cleared that much faster. 
“Cut next of kin time to fifteen 
minutes.” He was going out on a 
limb here, but it would speed the 
processing of accidents through 
Brooklyn and New Jersey. Now, 
with the rush hour just over and 
another beginning, wrecks wer e 
piling up outside the receiving 
centers and the crunchers were 
idle half the time. “Up minimum 
speed five miles an hour.” That 
would make it at least 100 miles an 
hour on every highway, 65 on the 
ramps. He flipped to visual, saw 
Beacons and Buzzers post the new 
speeds, saw the cars increase speed. 
Wrecks and Checks flashed the 
going aloft of the ten copters and 



86

he breathed easier, flipped to visual 
at Empire, saw the day’s third 
major pile-up on the third level, 
cursed. He closed the 34th Street 
cutoff, ordered three payloaders 
to dump all wrecks right there, 
flashed a message to Identification 
to have a team posted. By mid- 
night, when the traffic eased, they 
could begin moving the cars and 
bodies to New Jersey. 

The red phone rang, three rings. 
Double urgent. He grabbed it, 
barked his name. 

“The Director just dropped 
dead,” a hysterical voice said. 
“You’re acting Director.” 

“I’ll be right there.’’ Acting, 
hell. There were six hours left on 
his shift and he could get some- 
thing done now. He turned to 
Smith. “You’re Manager now,” 
he said, “I just got bumped up- 
stairs.” 

“Right.” Smith barely looked 
up. “Reopen Yonkers Four, lanes 
one through nine,” he said. 

He had made the transition 
from assistant to Manager in an 
instant. Training, Davis thought. 

He took the elevator to the 
eighth floor, the Director’s office. 
The staff was quiet, looking down 
at the body on the floor. There 
were four boards flashing, a dozen 
phones ringing. Davis snapped or- 
ders quickly. 

“You, you and you, answer the, 
phones,” he said. “You and you, 
get the boards. You, drag that 
body out of here. You — ” he 



pointed at the Director’s — his — 
secretary — “call a staff confer- 
ence. Now.” 

He looked at the boards, 
checked Traffic, Beacons and Buz- 
zers, Wrecks and Checks, Gate 
Receipts and Identification. Fatal- 
ities was doing extremely well — 
Wellborn was the new Manager 
here. The crunchers were doing 
well. Wrecks was reporting above 
normal pickup time. 

“The Director’s dead,” he told 
the staff. “I’m new Director.” 
They all nodded. “Most depart- 
ments look pretty good,” he said. 
He looked at Smith. “Traffic flow 
is lousy,” he said. “Why?” 

“Empire,” Smith said. “We’re 
losing twenty per cent just going 
around that goddamed building.” 
“How are your crews fixed for 
a major job?” Davis asked the 
Construction Manager. 

“Okay.” The Manager ticked 
off eleven small jobs. 

“The problem is at Empire,” 
Davis said flatly. “We can’t get 
around the building.” He looked 
at Construction. “Tear it down,” 
he said. “Meeting adjourned.” 
Later that day he looked south 
from the roof The Destruction 
team had the top ten floors off 
the Empire State Building and a 
corner cut of the fortieth floor 
with a lane of traffic whipping 
through it. The flow was good and 
he smiled. He couldn’t remember 
doing anything so necessary be- 
fore. ★

and touched his oddly parted, blue 
lips. The two younger boys stepped 
back. 

“He doesn’t look like he’s 
breathing,” Jamie said, “but his 
mouth is warm.” 

“Then he ain’t dead, is he?” To- 
nio asked. > 

“No. I don’t think he is.” 

The wind blew a bit of the 
orange powder across the snow and 
Packie, the youngest boy, scraped 
at the smears of pinon resin that 
coated his fingers. Leaning over 
the man’s elongated hairless skull, 
Jamie very carefully opened his 
shrouded eyes with a thumb and 
forefinger. 

The huge eyes were black — and 
faceted. 

O N THE edge of the town, a Po- 
lish woman lived in the white- 
washed wooden house directly 
across the arroyo from their hovel. 
Mrs. Zowodny was fat, manlike in 
appearance and crotchety. She 
wore coveralls under her mon- 
strously ample dresses and lived 
among a menagerie of stuffed elks’ 
heads and a brigade of porcelain 
figurines. 

She hovered every day between 
the kitchen and the murky parlor, 
as if she could not make up her 
mind in which direction ber appe- 
tites would most likely find fulfill- 
ment. She called the brothers 
“blackheads.” 

She called them blackheads, 
identified them in her mind with 



scar tissue and cancerous sores. It 
was as if the boys were physical 
blemishes on the sooty complexion 
of the town, on the old battered 
face of Huerfano. Jamie frequently 
pelted her house with clumps of 
mud or snow, depending on the 
season, so that she would come to 
the window, flushed and bulging- 
eyed, to shout at them. 

“You little blackheads! You 
think you are ‘Mericans; you are 
foreign trash cluttering the 
streets!” 

Then Jamie would bulge out his 
eyes derisively and shout back the 
single word: “Slav!” He spat it. 

At that he would turn, beckon 
to his brothers and lead them in a 
scrambling retreat down the banks 
of the arroyo that separated their 
houses. Their arms and legs would 
flail the air like the blurring plastic 
spokes of a pinwheel. Fuming, 
Mrs. Zowodny would watch them 

go. 

Soon neither the old woman nor 
the boys knew which of the two oc- 
currences had first established 
their enmity: the coining of the epi- 
thet “blackhead” or the ritualistic 
pelting of Mrs. Zowodny’s house. 
The pelting or the epithet, the epi- 
thet or the pelting. 

Now it did not matter at all. 

J AMIE slapped the man’s face. 

Looking upside down into the 
opaque, faceted eyes, he could see 
the image of himself and of his 
brothers. All three were milky sliv-

GALAXY 




ers of light in the small flat planes 
and with each slap the angular blue 
skull moved back and forth in the 
snow, flattening the snow, com- 
municating a warmth to Jamie’s 
hand. 

“Hey, ain’t he coming awake 
now, no?” Tonio asked. 

“I don’ know, but he’s warm; 
warm as can be.” 

“He’s wearing sompen on his 
eyes, no?” 

“Maybe. They are certainly 
strange eyes if he isn’t,” Jamie 
said. “They are certainly strange.” 
Packie was standing a little way 
off in the snow; he put his hands on 
his knees and leaned forward, 
cocking his head from side to side. 

“Grasshoppers have eyes like 
that,” he said. “And flies, too.” 
“Yes,” Jamie said. “It’s hard to 
tell if he’s alive, but he is very, 
very warm.” 

With a shudder of gray sinews 
and an indigo deepening of color 
the long body took on the sapphire 
luminosity of a dragonfly turning 
in the sun. The man’s lips parted 
and he moved one leg, crossing it 
over his body to cover his exposed 
knotted groin. All three boys fell 
back at the movement, scrambling 
away, struggling in the icy powder. 
The sun balanced precariously be- 
tween the Spanish Peaks. 

“Please,” the man said huskily. 
“Please cover me.” 

The boys crept back but Jamie 
was aware that it would be virtual- 



ly impossible to establish a rapport 
with the man, mostly because of 
the eyes, the terrible eyes. How 
could one make human contact 
with eyes that returned one’s 
image in a thousand distorted per- 
mutations? How would it be pos- 
sible to read the character of the 
entity — human or otherwise — who 
resided behind those eyes? Jamie 
stood to his full height, one foot 
hidden by the broken snow, and 
looked down into the creature’s 
face. Tonio and Packie stood awed 
and poker-spined at a small dis- 
tance. 

The eyes, the black, faceted 
eyes, glinted. 

“Please cover me,” said the odd 
mouth, grotesquely forming the 
sounds. “The snow weights down 
my own coverings. I can’t move.” 

“I’m going to help you up,” 
Jamie said. 

The boy kneeled behind the 
stricken creature and grasped him 
beneath his spindly arms. The 
man’s flesh was a uniform grayish 
blue, crisp to the touch and incred- 
ibly warm. His musculature was 
strangely reticulated: his abdomen 
seemed almost to consist of hinged 
segments, the corrugations in the 
flesh a darker color than the flesh 
which they apparently hinged. 
Jamie found it easy to lift the man 
to a partial sitting position, his 
body was so light. But then the 
man cried out in pain, huskily, in- 
articulately. 



PINON FALL

Jamie saw that growing from the 
man’s narrow shoulder blades were 
the beginnings of two sets of wings. 
The wings themselves lay out- 
spread and icily laden beneath the 
sculpted snow. In bringing the 
creature to a sitting position, Jam- 
ie had inadvertently twisted the 
sensitive membranes of those 
wings. 

“Lay me down again,” the crea- 
ture said. “Lay me down and cov- 
er me. Cover me against the cold.” 
“Hey, brother,” Tonio said, 
“let’s get out of here, no? He ain’t 
a real person. He may be sompen 
else but he ain’t no real person.” 
Jamie took off his coat after 
easing the naked man back into the 
snow. Then he wrapped his thread- 
bare woolen muffler around the 
man’s neck, winding it once 
around his hard constricted chest, 
and finished by draping the cor- 
duroy coat over the man’s chest 
and hips. But the coat was pitifully 
small and did not begin to cover 
the man. 

“Why don’ we move the snow 
off his wings?” Packie suggested. 
The boys exchanged bewildered 
looks and the man lay back in the 
orange-tinctured snow with noth- 
ing whatever alive in his faceted 
eyes, nothing at all. 

M rs. ZOWODNY had been 
alone all the first day the snow 
fell. Because her eyesight was fail- 
ing and because she refused to turn 
on the electricity, she moved about 



among her dusty statuary and mil- 
dewed elks’ heads with a singular 
clumsiness. Her swollen feet navi- 
gated the dark areas between otto- 
mans and overstuffed chairs but 
only with difficulty. At last she 
came to the small shuttered win- 
dow in her kitchen, and paused. 

There were colored bottles on 
the interior sill, above the sink, and 
ugly glass ashtrays she had no need 
for; and these items had to be tak- 
en down before she could open 
the peeling shutters. She took them 
down and ranged them along the 
edge of the sink. 

Outside, the drifts filled her 
yard, swan-necked peaks that 
curled like stiffened meringue. Her 
breath steamed the glass but by 
squinting she was able to make out 
the alien thing that was lodged in 
the snow almost directly under the 
window, a soft cylindrical shell. 
She squinted and smacked her lips 
in consternation. 

“Them blackheads,” she mut- 
tered. “Them blackheads.” 

The shell was very much like an 
outsized cocoon. It lay in the snow 
somewhat lopsidedly, for it was at- 
tached by filaments of ice and 
strands of a glistening silken sub- 
stance to a long plank; the plank 
itself embedded in the snow. Mrs. 
Zowodny looked at the clutter in 
her yard, smacked her lips again 
and muttered several words which 
her thick tongue virtually smoth- 
ered. With a palsied hand she 
pushed the shutters to.

GALAXY 




J AMIE and Tonio were kneeling 
on opposite sides of the out- 
stretched man, scooping up jars of 
snow and depositing the snow out 
of the way, behind the man’s out- 
stretched arms. Packie sat cross- 
legged under a pinon tree and con- 
tinued to worry over the gooey 
white resin that adhered to his fin- 
gers. Beside him was his own wide- 
mouthed fruit jar, now brimful of 
pinon nuts: the two older boys had 
emptied their jars into his that they 
might remove the snow from the 
creature’s wings. The creature ad- 
monished them. 

“Dig very gently,” he told them. 
“Keep your knees back and dig as 
gently as you can.” 

In twenty minutes Jamie and 
Tonio were through. Revealed to 
them were the soft paperlike mem- 
branes of the man’s wings. He 
looked very much like a sallow, 
whey-faced saint from an El Greco 
painting, a saint miraculously in- 
vested with four diaphanous capes 
with which to shield his tortured 
body. The boys gaped and the San- 
gre de Cristo mountains rose up 
on the west like a chiseled, living 
wall of white granite. 

“Let me help you up,” Jamie 
said. 

He lifted the man to a sitting 
position for a second time, then 
awkwardly got him to his narrow, 
trembling legs. Lifting him, Jamie 
remarked on the strange creature’s 
astonishing lack of weight; the 
man seemed to consist only of air 



and the ethereal burden of his pa- 
pery flesh. It was then, too, that 
Jamie noticed that the orange 
powder on the snow was scaly dust 
from the man’s multicolored 
wings, the dust that had outlined 
his flanks. 

But the wings were wet, wet 
from the snow and wet as if they 
had only recently molted. 

“The name that you may call 
me,” the man said, “is Papilio. 
That is not my given name, nor 
even an approximation; but it is 
what you may call me.” 

“Papilio,” Jamie said. 

“Yes.” 

In the failing sunlight the crea- 
ture Papilio began very slowly to 
manipulate his wings, moving them 
back and forth, back and forth, 
covering and uncovering his naked, 
manlike body. As he moved them 
the wings shimmered beneath the 
emblazoned weight of red and 
orange peacock eyes. Royal blue 
hieroglyphics also shimmered with 
the movement of his wings and the 
movement was rhythmic. Jamie de- 
cided that those hieroglyphics easi- 
ly could have been the characters 
of an alien tongue, but he watched 
the man and said nothing. 

“I’m afraid that the sun is dy- 
ing,” Papilio said. “My wings are 
still damp and I’m hungry, very 
hungry.” 

So the boys fed him pinon nuts. 
They cracked the tiny nuts with 
their teeth and clumsily shelled 
them, picking at the hard rinds like 



PINON FALL

jewelers working over the mecha- 
nisms in a watch. Having shelled 
the nuts, they gave the sweet white 
kernels to Papilio and watched him 
eat. 

As he ate his emblazoned wings 
moved very slowly back and forth, 
as thin and translucent as Japanese 
silk screens. Jamie watched the sun 
and felt the wind. 

Clouds were forming above the 
Spanish peaks, presaging another 
snowfall. 

M rs. ZOWODNY looked out 
through the frosted kitchen 
window. Except to putter through 
the rubble in her own fenced-in 
yard, she very rarely ventured out- 
side. She had a son who worked 
construction machinery on the new 
passes that were being built 
through the Sangre de Cristo range 
and this young man brought gro- 
ceries to the house every Thursday 
afternoon. Although she bullied 
him about his personal life, he re- 
mained dutiful; and she depended 
on his visits for the opportunity to 
rail about the “blackheads” who 
vandalized the property of such in- 
dustrious Americans as herself. 
Soon the young man came only on 
Thursdays and only to deliver his 
mother’s groceries. 

More and more, Mrs. Zowodny 
was left to the creaking solitude of 
her house, left to stare at the lacy 
rime on the windowpanes. 

But now she had made up her 
mind to go out. The thing beneath 



the kitchen window demanded that 
she approach someone with au- 
thority over the boys who pelted 
her house and who, apparently, had 
violated the sanctity of her yard. 
She put a scarf over her head and 
with considerable effort squeezed 
her swollen feet into rubber ga- 
loshes. Upon breathing the out- 
side air that rushed coldly into her 
nostrils, she smacked her lips to- 
gether in surprise. The front door 
banged shut on the dusty bric-a- 
brac within. 

In coveralls and a frayed sweat- 
er, which she clutched tightly to 
her middle, Mrs. Zowodny trun- 
dled down the snow-blanketed side 
of the arroyo. Her scarf flapped 
and her fat upholstered legs sank 
into the drifts. A solitary magpie 
watched her from the top of her 
own picket fence. 

Struggling, she came up the gul- 
ly’s opposite bank and negotiated 
the wire gate and the stepping- 
stone walkway in the boys’ front 
yard. For her it was a typical chi- 
cano home, the kind inevitably 
constructed of mud and plaster, 
the kind with linoleum strips over 
the broken-out windows. Breathing 
through numb lips, she knocked on 
the door. 

The woman who answered the 
knocking was thin and pale, 
though her paleness was plainly 
more the result of a washed-out 
weariness than of any actual white- 
ness of the flesh. Mrs. Zowodny 
squinted at her and the woman in

the door made a helpless gesture 
with her left hand. Mrs. Zowodny 
leaned forward: 

“You are the mother? You are 
the Mrs. Aguilera?” 

“Yes.” 

“And the boys, where are they 
running at now?” 

The helpless gesture with the left 
hand, made not in response but 
from weariness. 

“You should be keeping a track 
of where they go and what they 
did. I raised up a young man of 
mine own, I did; and you must 
watch their antics. Yes, you 
must!” 

“They are out for the pihon 
nuts, Mrs. Zowodny. At two 
o’clock they left for the pinon 
nuts.” 

“They have been dropping their 
trash at my yard!” 

“No,” the chicano woman said 
wearily. “No, Mrs. Zowodny.” 

For several minutes the two 
women stood in the fragile warmth 
of the open doorway and ex- 
changed arguments tinged with 
wholly disparate kinds of provin- 
cialism. Mrs. Zowodny argued 
heatedly, her lips giving rise to cold 
balloons, little captions of breath. 
Mrs. Aguilera lethargically re- 
sisted,'guarding her doorway. Then 
the Polish woman’s face drew into 
a contorted parody of itself and 
she made a hissing sound. 

“You think you are a mother. 
You are a chicano slut!” 

“No, Mrs. Zowodny.” The 



woman stepped from the security 
of her doorway and closed the 
door behind her. She was wearing 
only a thin cotton garment, and 
her face, in profile, was a hard pa- 
pier-mache mask. Mrs. Zowodny 
moved instinctively out of her way. 
The chicano woman strode oii the 
stepping stones to the wire gate 
and stopped there to look at the 
Spanish Peaks, two black granite 
shadows blocking the sun. “No, 
Mrs. Zowodny,” she said. 

Both hands reassuringly clutch- 
ing her frayed sweater, Mrs. Zo- 
wodny followed the boys’ mother 
to the gate. But she followed slow- 
ly- 

Mrs. Aguilera turned. 

“It is cold. Last night I had a 
dream about the snow, a very 
strange dream. Snow was falling 
over the whole world. It fell in 
Colorado and in Mexico. It was 
falling even on the deserts in Afri- 
ca. The camels were standing in 
the snow.” 

“Camels in the snow?” 

“Yes, Mrs. Zowodny. Shaggy, 
shaggy beasts looking up at the 
sky and watching the snow fall out 
of the sun.” 

Mrs. Zowodny stood three wet 
stones away from the chicano 
woman; she ran her raw tongue 
over the fissures in her lips and 
blinked, angrily bewildered. 

“Do you know what else?” Mrs. 
Aguilera asked. “There were 
mariposas. All over the world, 
huge butterflies swam in the white 



PINON FALL 



95 




storms. And moths, too, shaggy 
moths that danced among the 
snowflakes. Moths and butterflies 
of every color that there is.” She 
stopped and tightened her lips be- 
fore speaking again. “Ves, Mrs. 
Zowodny.” 

“Oof!” the other said, register- 
ing disgust. 

“And tonight the snow will 
come again. And if I dream, there 
will be camels in the snow, and 
butterflies.” 

“You should stop this dreaming 
and watch them boys.” 

“We will need wood for a fire,” 
Mrs. Aguilera said to herself. “We 
will need wood.” 

Mrs. Zowodny remembered her 
rare mission beyond her own yard 
and drew her face into its doughy 
self-parody. She let Mrs. Agui- 
lera’s last words turn over in her 
mind. She made up the three 
stones between them and grasped 
Mrs. Aguilera’s loose, cotton 
sleeve. Her face twitched. 

“You’ve got an axe? An axe for 
chopping wood?” 

“Yes.” 

“I will borrow, then, your axe.” 

Mrs. Aguilera did not argue 
with the old woman. She found the 
axe in the empty wood box beside 
the door and handed it to Mrs. Zo- 
wodny by its rusted head. The old 
woman took the axe in both 
hands, both visibly shaking hands. 

“Thank you,” she said. “Send 
the oldest boy to bring it back — if 
he don’ stay out all night.” 



Then she left Mrs. Aguilera and 
crossed the arroyo to her own 
house, at first hefting the axe 
across her body and then dragging 
it by the long worn handle. A mag- 
pie flew up when she entered her 
gate. She could almost feel the 
sweat on her upper lip crystalizing. 

In the back yard she went to the 
thing under the kitchen window 
and stared indecisively at its glis- 
tening bulk. It glistened with a pe- 
culiar whiteness. 

Dusk enveloped the house and 
trees. 

At last she brought the axe to 
her shoulder and let it drop listless- 
ly into the soft integument of the 
thing. The cocoonlike shell rup- 
tured. Suddenly Mrs. Zowodny’s 
eyes blazed up. Again and again 
she chopped at the thing, the rusted 
axe head making clumsy arcs in 
the failing light. Membranous col- 
ors gushed out of the shell and 
spilled onto the snow, diaphanous 
capes of orange and scarlet and 
blue. The plank to which the thing 
had been attached lay broken in 
countless splinters. 

Mrs. Zowodny was panting. Her 
armpits ached and the axe fell 
from her trembling hands into the 
snow. She looked at her handi- 
work without comprehension, then 
went into the house and turned on 
a single electric light. Still sweat- 
ing, she sat down in an overstuffed 
chair and let the shadows move 
across her doughy face. 

It was nearly two hours before 



96

she got up and went into the back 
yard to see what she had done. 

11^ HEN the boys came into their 
■■ own yard it was very late. A 
few ffosted pinpoints of light were 
visible in the eastern sky but from 
the other direction came the bur- 
geoning front of snowclouds which 
massed over the Sangre de Cristo 
range and spread like a cancer into 
the regions of clean night sky. 
Jamie led the boys into the yard. 
They had returned with only two 
fruit jars and both were empty and 
lackluster. 

Papilio had refused to venture 
as far as the house with them and 
they intuitively understood his re- 
luctance. He had remained in a 
mine opening several hundred 
yards beyond their adobe hovel, 
wrapped in the silken covering of 
his wings, hiding his nakedness be- 
hind those beautiful tapestried 
membranes. Jamie could still see 
him placing a pinon nut on his 
strange indigo tongue, sucking the 
kernel out of the shell and spitting 
out the shattered rind — all with 
merely the efficient workings of 
his long, papery mandibles. So 
they had come home with only two 
fruit jars, both of them empty. 

The younger boys went imme- 
diately to bed. 

Mrs. Aguilera asked Jamie 
about the pinon nuts, and he told 
her that he had left the jars in the 
wood box outside the door. He 



neither denied nor affirmed their 
emptiness. 

“Bueno," the boy’s mother said. 
“Then you know that the wood 
box is empty. And tonight it will 
be cold again, with more snow.” 

“Yes.” 

“Mrs. Zowodny has borrowed 
the axe. Go over to her house and 
bring the axe home. Tomorrow 
you will go out for the wood.” 

“Let me go in the morning for 
the axe, too.” 

“No. Tomorrow you will have 
other excuses.” 

“Why did she borrow the axe? 
She has a coal furnace.” 

“I didn’t put my nose in her 
business. Now, go.” 

Jamie found the stepping stones 
in the dark, hobbled through the 
gate and plunged into the piles of 
drifted snow in the arroyo. He pre- 
tended that the snow was a vast 
hinterland of grassy meadow and 
clambered through it as if its wet- 
ness were a wholy nonexistent 
quality. He pretended that zebras 
and wildebeeste lay in wait for him 
in the grasses of that hinterland. 
He saw the broken-crusted foot- 
prints of a creature that had pre- 
ceded him, and his heart thumped 
hard against his chest. 

His visions dissolved. The wind 
chilled him, blowing powdery dust 
into the air; and he came upon the 
old woman’s dimly lit house with a 
sense of detached contempt for his 
fantasies. The house was stolid, 
compact and real. It seemed to 



PINON FALL 



97 




heave in the new darkness just as 
the snow shifted under his feet. 

At the whitewashed gate he 
paused and listened. He heard an 
odd skittering inside Mrs. Zowod- 
ny’s house, like the toenails of a 
tiny dog pattering over linoleum. 
Jamie turned and peered into the 
density of blackness from which he 
had come; what he saw was merely 
the blurred patina of light that em- 
anated diffusely from the grouping 
hovels on the other side of the ar- 
royo. But he had heard something 
distinct from that direction, too. 

A scraping on the snow; then a 
hollow fluttering that was barely 
audible over the sequent hush and 
wheezing of the wind. The nap of 
his corduroy jacket stiffened; he 
could feel bumplets of chicken 
flesh puckering in the small of his 
back. Then a clatter came from the 
house, a metallic din that dimin- 
ished into a pattering and died. 

Jamie turned rapidly again. 

An odor hung in the air. It came 
into his nostrils with a kind of 
shocking subtlety, an odor that he 
knew would assert itself even if the 
smells of skunk and napthaline 
were also in the air. He coughed, 
put his hands over his mouth and 
walked through the gate toward 
the noise that he had heard issue 
from Mrs. Zowodny’s house. The 
porch light was on and the front 
door stood completely open. 

As Jamie entered the house 
snow began to fall: the stars fell as 
snowflakes. 



In the oppressively warm foyer 
he waited for his eyes to adjust and 
wondered about his sudden nerv- 
ousness. Why had Mrs. Zowod- 
ny borrowed an axe when her 
house possessed a coal-burning 
furnace? What was the smell that 
flooded him like the scent of a 
musty, organic cologne? Why had 
the old woman’s door been open 
and her porch lamp on? Jamie fo- 
cused on the outlines of weight and 
substance that were emerging from 
the darkness in the parlor. 

What finally took shape for him 
was the hump-shouldered figure of 
Mrs. Zowodny herself. Her legs 
were braced in an awkward at- 
tempt to spraddle something on 
the floor and her head was down. 
The door behind the old woman 
was open, and Jamie saw past her 
doubled body into the back yard. 
Then he looked down. The thing 
that Mrs. Zowodny was doubled 
over was very like a sleeping bag 
from which the lining has been 
gutted and torn free. Remnants of 
that lining lay in scaly iridescence 
on the hard wood floor of both the 
hallway and parlor. The smell of 
the glandular perfume was stifling. 

Snow whirled into the kitchen 
and the door behind Jamie 
slammed shut in the draft. Mrs. 
Zowodny looked up in the half 
light and stared at the boy from 
her huge pouchy eyes. He had ar- 
rested her in an action of some im- 
portance and she was panting gro- 
tesquely from the physical effort

involved. His own heart pounded 
uncontrollably; and Mrs. Zowod- 
ny’s blood-choked eyes blazed as 
she snarled the familiar epithet. 

“You little blackhead! Why do 
you not knock?” 

“The axe,” he said, nearly sti- 
fling. “The axe.” 

Mrs. Zowodny’s terrible bloody 
eyes grew larger; and even through 
his fear Jamie understood that she 
was no longer looking at him but 
instead at the gloom that deep- 
ened at his back. A rippling move- 
ment of air made him simulta- 
neously whirl about and step back- 
ward from the door. 

As he focused on Papilio’s lean 
blue body and the peacock-eyed 
draperies of his wings, Jamie heard 
the rattle of the old woman’s 
stunned voice. This time Papilio’s 
faceted eyes gave back no images. 

“She has killed the female of 
this region,” he said. 

“Papilio,” Jamie said. 

“That is not my name,” Papilio 
said. 

He strode past the boy, carrying 
his wings lifted and outspread, an 
entomological presence who made 
the walls of the house, the floor 
and ceiling, contract upon one an- 
other like the parts of a shrinking 
garment. Jamie followed in the 
cluttered wake of Papilio’s wings 
and watched as the creature placed 
his segmented hands around Mrs. 
Zowodny’s neck. Her eyes bulged 
in terror and her fat speckled hands 
came up feebly, feebly to ward off 



the grip that was unremittingly 
carrying her to her'knees. 

“Stop it!” Jamie screamed. 

He found a ceramic figurine on 
a small end table and brought it 
down on Papilio’s elongated skull, 
striking him from behind. The 
odor in the house was now unbear- 
able and he could feel sickness 
coming on as the supple creature 
slumped away from the old wom- 
an and collapsed into the broken 
folds of his wings. Mrs. Zowodny 
opened and closed her mouth like 
a dying fish; and looking down at 
her with the base of the shattered 
figurine in his hand, Jamie saw a 
cold glint of acknowledgment in 
the old woman’s eyes, just before 
they closed irrevocably. 

“Many others will come,” Pa- 
pilio said. He lay crumpled be- 
tween an overstaffed chair and the 
thing which the old woman had 
dragged in from the back yard. 
“They are coming now.” 

The glandular odor was over- 
whelming. As Jamie looked into 
the kitchen and into the back yard, 
he became aware of angular shad- 
ows dropping from the sky, thread- 
ing their way through the multitu- 
dinous snowflakes, dropping on 
outspread capes of blue and scar- 
let. The snow was full of wings, 
and the muted whirring that Jamie 
heard was a universal music. 

Somewhere, miles and miles be- 
yond the Sangre de Cristo moun- 
tains, camels were standing in the 
snow.

J AKE escorted Joan Eunice to 
her boudoir. Winnie was waiting 
there — to Joan’s annoyance as she 
thought it possible that Jake’s 
stern character might slip if the up- 
per house were quiet. But she did 
not show it. “Hi, Winnie!’’ 

“Miss Joan! Are you all right? 
I’ve been so worried!’’ 

“Of course I’m all right; Mr. 
Salomon was taking care of me. 
Why were you worried, dear?” 
“Why, the dreadful things 
they’ve been saying about you in 
the news and there was a riot at the 
Hall of Justice; I saw it. And—” 



“Winnie, Winnie! The idiot box 
is for idiots; why do you look at 
it? I was never in danger.” 

“But she has. had a trying day, 
so you take good care of her, 
Winnie.” 

“Oh, I will, sir!” 

“And I am tired, too, so I’ll say 
good night and go to bed. After I 
find a sandwich, perhaps.” 

“Hubert put a tray in your suite, 
sir.” 

“Hubert gets another merit 
badge. Though to tell the truth, 
Winnie, I’ve had a worrisome day 
myself and it’s left me with little 
appetite and jangled nerves. I may 
dine on a sleeping pill.” 



101 




“Jake dear — ” 

“Yes, Eunice?” 

“Don’t take a pill. And do eat.” 
“But—” 

“I know, I’m a bundle of nerves 
myself. But I know what to do 
about it — and Winnie and I can 
soothe your nerves and restore 
your appetite and make you sleep 
like a baby.” 

He cocked one eyebrow, looked 
at Eunice, then at Winnie. “I think 
either of you could. But both?” 
“Jake, you’re a dirty-minded 
old man; you’ll have Winnie blush- 
ing. But we can — can’t we, Win- 
nie? The Money Hum.” 

“Oh. Yes, we can, Mr. Salo- 
mon.” 

“Harrumph! Does it involve 
blood? Or broken bones?” 

“Oh, no sir! It’s restful. Relax- 
ing.” 

“I’ll try anything once.” 

Joan said, “But you have to 
strip for it to — ” 

“I thought there was a catch.” 
“Oh, Jake. We’ll let you sissy; 
you can wear shorts. We strip for 
it; the spiritual effect is better. It’s 
the way we warm up for our exer- 
cises. Go undress, then put on 
shorts and a robe. We’ll join you 
in the Green Suite. Right after it 
you’re going to have a bite to eat 
and a tepid tub and straight to bed 
and right to sleep.” 

“Maybe I’d better bathe first. A 
day in court leaves me smelling 
like a skunk.” 

“You smell all right. Anyhow, 
Winnie and I have such control by 
now that we can decide not to be 
able to smell — or to hear a dis- 
tracting noise, or anything — if we 
choose to.”

“That’s true, Mr. Salomon.” 
“Okay. Winnie, if she beats me, 
you protect me. Adios, dears.” 
“Five minutes, Jake.” 

As soon as they were alone 
Winifred said, “You’re going to 
make me strip down bare? Again?” 
“I didn’t ‘make’ you strip the 
first time. And dear Doctor cer- 
tainly did notice that you were a 
girl. Looked to me as if the kiss he 
gave you was better than the one 
he gave me. Stop blushing. Win- 
nie, you can sissy, too, if you want 
to — but I do need you present. Or 
Jake will think I’m trying to make 
him.” 

“Oh, Mr. Salomon would never 
think that about you.” 

“He’s male. He’s as male as 
dear Doctor. I need chaperonage 
as all I’m after is to help him sleep 
without pills. The poor dear has 
had a dreadful day. Winnie, he was 
wonderful in court; I’ll tell you 
about it. Later. Let’s get these 
duds off and grab negligees. Mod- 
est ones.” Joan Eunice stopped 
suddenly. “Perhaps I’ve goofed. 
Winsome? Do you have a date?” 
Miss Gersten blushed again. 
“Uh . not until later.” 

“Paul working late? Sorry — 
erase and correct. None of my 
business.” 

The little redhead continued to 
blush but she answered steadily, 
“My business is always your busi- 
ness, Miss Joan. Uh, I’m supposed 
to take care of you — and I do try! 
But you feel like a big sister to 
me. 

“Thank you, sweet Winsome. 
But big sisters should not snoop.” 
“I’ve been meaning to tell you. 
Paul and I have split.”

“Oh, I’m sorry!” 

“I’m not. I don’t think Paul ever 
meant to get a dissolution; he was 
stringing me. But — well, Bob isn’t 
married. Not yet.” 

“ ‘Not yet.’ Planning on getting 
married, dear?” 

“Well ... I don’t think getting 
married is something one plans. It 
just happens. Like thunderstorms.” 
“You could be right. Sweet, 
whether it’s getting married, or fun 
and happiness, I hope it’s perfect 
for you. And Bob is such a com- 
mon name that I can’t be tempted 
to guess. If I don’t see him.” 

“You probably won’t. He 
comes up the service lift and into 
my rooms from the back corridor 
— nobody sees him but the guard 
on duty. And they don’t gossip.” 

“If any guard ever gossips about 
anything in this house and I find it 
out, he’ll be on Welfare so fast 
he’ll be dizzy. Winnie, the rest of 
the staff can be human about it. 
But a guard is in a specially 
trusted position and must keep his 
mouth shut. Winnie, if you ever 
want to see Bob — or anyone — 
somewhere else. I’ll have my mo- 
bile guards deliver you and pick 
you up and even I won’t know 
where.” 

“Uh . thank you. But this is 
the safest place for us — so few 
places are safe today. The most 
that can happen here is that Bob 
might be embarrassed. I wouldn’t 
be embarrassed at all. I’m proud 
of him!” 

“That’s the way to feel, dear. 
As an ex-man I know that’s the at- 
titude a man values most in a 
woman. ‘Proud of him.’ But let’s 
hurry; we’re keeping Jake waiting. 



If you’re going to wear pants, bet- 
ter find some with stretch in them. 
And thank you for lending me this 
outfit — turned out that, without 
the apron and cap, it was still most 
effective. I had the robe off a 
while. Tell you later.” 

I N MOMENTS the girls were 
hurrying down the corridor to 
the Green Suite, each just in negli- 
gee and bare-footed. At the last in- 
stant Winifred had decided that, if 
her mistress was going to practice 
meditation in the correct uniform, 
she would also. 

They found the counselor in a 
bathrobe, looking sheepish. Joan 
said, “I hope we haven’t kept you 
waiting. Is your tub ready? If not. 
I’m going to draw it before we 
start. Then into it and out, don’t 
risk falling asleep. Then — ” 

“I cheated. I took a quick tub — 
tepid, as you specified — and ate a 
little, too.” 

“Good. Then we’ll pop you 
straight into bed after this and kiss 
you good night and you’ll be 
asleep before we’re out the door. 
Jake, this is the simplest of yoga, 
not exercise, just meditation. Con- 
trolled breathing, but the easiest 
sort. Inhale through one repetition 
of the prayer, hold it through one 
more, exhale through one, hold 
through one, and repeat. All of us 
together, in a triangle. Can you sit 
in lotus? Probably not unless 
you’ve practiced.” 

“Eunice—” 

“Yes, Jake?” 

“My father was a tailor. I was 
sitting in tailor’s seat before I was 
eight. Will that do?” 

“Certainly if you are comforta- 
ble. If not, any position that lets

you relax. For you have to forget 
your body.” 

“Squatted in a tailor’s position 
I can fall asleep. But what’s this 
prayer?” 

Joan Eunice slipped off her neg- 
ligee, melted down onto the rug 
into meditation pose, soles upward 
on her thighs, palms upward in her 
lap. “It goes like this. Om Mani 
Padme Hum.” (Om Mani Padme 
Hum. I should have taught Jake 
this long ago.) 

“I know the phrase. ‘The Jewel 
in the Lotus.’ But what does it 
mean to you, Joan Eunice?” 

Winifred had followed Joan’s 
example as quickly as she set it, 
was bare and in lotus — and not 
blushing. She answered, “It means 
everything and nothing, Mr. Salo- 
mon. It is all the good things you 
know of — bravery and beauty and 
gentleness and not wanting what 
you can’t have and being happy 
with what you do have and trees 
swaying in the wind and fat little 
babies gurgling when you tickle 
their feet and anything that makes 
life good. Love. It always means 
love. But you don’t think about it, 
you don’t think at all, you don’t 
even try not to think. You chant 
the prayer and just be — until you 
find yourself floating, all warm 
and good and relaxed.” 

“Okay, I’ll try.” He took off his 
bathrobe, had under it boxer 
shorts. “Joan Eunice, when did 
you take up yoga? Winnie teach 
you?” 

“Oh, no!” said Winifred. “Miss 
Joan taught me — she’s much far- 
ther along the Path than I am.” 

(Watch it. Boss!) (No huhu. Lu- 
lu.) “One learns many things, Jake

— and loses them for lack of time. 
I used to play chess, yet I haven’t 
set up a board for fifty years. But 
for longer than that I could no 
longer even attempt a lotus seat 
. until Eunice gave me this won- 
derful young body which can do 
anything.” (Which shell is the pea 
under, Eunice?) (It’ll be under you 
if you relax too much; you should 
have emptied our bladder.) (Never 
fear, dear. I shan’t go under, must 
watch Jake.) “Join us, Jake. You 
lead, Winnie; start as soon as Jake 
is in position.” 

Salomon started to sit on the 
floor, suddenly stopped and got 
out of his shorts. Joan was de- 
lighted, taking it as a sign that he 
had decided to give in to it all the 
way. But she did not let her serene 
expression change nor move her 
eyes. Winifred. was staring at her 
navel; if she noticed it, she did not 
show it. 

“Inhale,” Winifred said softly. 
“Om Mani Padme Hum. Hold. 
Om Mani Padme Hum. Breath 
out. Om Mani Padme Hum. 
Hold ...” 

(Om Mani Padme Hum. Dig 
that clamdigger, dearie?) (Shut up! 
You’ll ruin the mood. Om Mani 
Padme Hum.) 

“Om Mani Padme Hum!” said 
Salomon in a voice that would 
have graced a cathedral. “Om 
Mani Padme Hum!” 

<<117 INNIE darling,” Joan said 
■ ■ softly. “Let it fade and 
wake up wide. We’re going to have 
to wake Jake.” 

The redhead’s eyes fluttered, she 
whispered one more prayer and 
waited. “Jake, darling,” Joan said 

104 




softly. “Eunice is calling. Wake 
just enough to let us help you into 
bed. Eunice is calling you back. 
Jake, dearest.” 

“I hear you, Eunice.” 

“How do you feel?” 

“Eh? Relaxed. Wonderful. 
Much rested but ready to sleep. 
Say, it does work. But it’s just au- 
tohypnosis.” 

“Did I even hint that it was any- 
thing else? Jake, I don’t expect to 
find God by staring into my belly 
button. But it does work . and 
it’s better than forcing your body 
with drugs. Now let Winnie and 
me help you into bed.” 

“I can manage.” 

“Of course you can but I don’t 
want the relaxation to wear off. 
Indulge me, Jake, let us baby you. 
Please.” 

He smiled and let them — slid 
into the opened bed, let them cover 
him, smiled again when Joan Eu- 
nice gave him a motherly good 
night kiss, seemed unsurprised 
when Winifred followed her mis- 
tress’s example — turned on his 
side and was asleep as the girls 
left the room. 

“Don’t bother,” Joan said as 
Winifred started to put on her 
negligee. “It’s my house and no 
one comes upstairs after dinner 
unless sent for. Except Hubert and 
I assume that Jake sent him to 
bed — Jake knew he would be 
called on by two tarts in three- 
quarters time and not much else.” 
She slid an arm around the red- 
head’s slender waist. “Winnie, 
much as I like to dress up — isn’t 
it nice to wear just skin?” 

“I like it. Indoors. Not out- 
doors, I sunburn so badly.” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“What about at night? When I 
was a boy, ages and ages ago, it 
got unbearably hot in July and 
August where we lived — the side- 
walks used to burn my bare feet. 
Houses were bake ovens even at 
night — no air-conditioning. An 
electric fan was a luxury most 
people did not have. Nights when 
I couldn’t sleep because of heat I 
used to sneak quiet as a mouse 
and bare as a frog out by the back 
door, being oh, so careful not to 
let my parents hear, and walk na- 
ked in the dark, with grass cool on 
my feet and the soft night breeze 
velvet on my skin. Heavenly!” 

“It sounds heavenly. But I 
would be terrified of getting 
mugged.” 

“The word ‘mug’ hadn’t been 
invented, much less any fear of it. 
I was a middle-aged man before I 
became wary of the dark.” They 
turned into the master bedroom. 
“Kiss me good night. Winsome, 
and go keep your date. Sleep late 
in the morning; I’m going to.” 

“Uh, my date isn’t until after 
midnight. Aren’t you going to tell 
me what happened today?” 

“Why, of course, dear. Thought 
you might be in a hurry. Come 
take a bath with me?” 

“If you want me to. I bathed 
after dinner.” 

“And you have your face on for 
your date. I bathed this morning 
but that seems a week ago. Sniff 
me and tell me just how badly I 
stink.” 

“You smell all right. Luscious.” 
“Then I’ll let it go with tooth- 
brush and bidet and a swipe at my 
armpits; I’d rather go to bed.” 

“You haven’t had dinner.” 



105 




“Not all that hungry. Just hap- 
py. Is there milk in my bedroom 
fridge? Milk and crackers is all I 
want. Want to join me with a glass 
for yourself and get crumbs in bed 
and talk girl talk? Things I can’t 
mention to dear Jake now that I’m 
a girl and not mean, old, cantan- 
kerous Johann.’’ 

“Joanie, I don’t believe you ever 
were cantankerous.” 

“Oh, yes — I was, hon. I hurt 
most of the time and was de- 
pressed all of the time and wasn’t 
fit to live with. But Joan Eunice is 
never depressed; her bowels are 
too regular. Scrounge us two 
glasses of milk and a box of crack- 
ers while I take a pretend bath. 
Don’t go downstairs; there will be 
something over there in the iron 
rations. Fig newtons, maybe, or 
vanilla wafers.” 

S OON they were sitting, munch- 
ing in the big bed while Joan 
Eunice gave an edited account of 
the day: “ — so we visited in Judge 
Mac’s chambers and let the car go 
on ahead, as Judge Mac, the sweet 
darling, wouldn’t hear of my leav- 
ing through the streets. Even 
though the phony riot was over. 
Then we switched from copter to 
car at Safe Harbor and came 
home.” (Protecting her ‘inno- 
cence,’ twin?) (Not bloody likely. 
Protecting Jake’s reputation.) 

“But the best part of the day 
was when I took off that street 
robe and let ’em look at that Aca- 
pulco outfit you dressed me in. 
Made ’em go ape, dear.” 

“ ‘Ape?’ ” 

“Out-of-date slang. They 
dropped one wing and ran in cir- 

106 



cles, like a rooster about to tread 
a strange hen.” 

“It wasn’t the outfit, it was 
you.” 

“Both. Eunice Branca had a 
heavenly body and I’m doing my 
best to justify it. With your help. 
As may be, both those darling men 
kissed me the nearest thing to rape 
I’ve encountered.” 

“Better than Doctor Garcia?” 

“I don’t think Doctor Garcia 
gave me his all-out best. I think he 
was inhibited by surprise and by 
the presence of a red-headed nurse 
I could name. But these two 
weren’t inhibited and had a couple 
of drinks in them and each was 
doing his darnedest to. do better 
than the other one. Whew! Winnie, 
I do not exaggerate — if Jake 
hadn’t been there, I think they 
would have had me down on the 
rug for a gang bang in two sec- 
onds.” 

“Uh . would you have strug- 
gled?” (Going to be truthful, tart?) 
(Who taught me to be a tart? Any 
reason not to tell her, Eunice?) 
(None. Except that she’s likely to 
rape you herself.) (Oh, pooh, she’s 
just killing time till her date.) 
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.) 

“Winnie, if I were a real lady, I 
would be horrified. But I won’t 
pretend with my chum. I don’t 
know much about being female 
but I seem to have strong instincts. 
Cross my heart, if either of those 
sweet men had given me a gentle 
shove, I would have landed on that 
rug with my legs open and eyes 
closed. Gang bang? By then I felt 
ready to take on a regiment.” 

Winfred said thoughtfully, “It 
happened to me once.” 



GALAXY 




“A regimentT’ 

“No. A gang bang.” 

“Well! Let’s shoo the crumbs 
out of bed and squeeze down the 
lights and snuggle and you tell big 
sister. Were they mean to you?” 
“Not really. Oh, dear, I’m 
blushing already. Turn off every- 
thing but one floor light and let 
me tell it against your neck.” 

“That better?” 

“Yes.” 

“Now tell Mama.” 

“Uh, it was the night I gradu- 
ated from training. I wasn’t a vir- 
gin — I’m not sure there was a vir- 
gin in my class. But this was some- 
thing else. Some interns gave a 
party for some of us. That was 
fine and I expected one of them to 
get me alone. Interns are the horn- 
iest people and a girl didn’t accept 
a date with one unless she meant 
business. But the party was toads 
of champagne and no food. Joan, 
I had never had champagne be- 
fore.” 

“Oho! I can write the ending.” 
“Well . champagne doesn’t 
taste strong. I sopped up a lot of 
it. 

“Then I was in bed and it was 
happening. Wasn’t surprised and 
tried to cooperate. But things went 
vague. I noticed that he wasn’t 
dark-haired after all; he had hair 
as red as mine. When I had been 
certain that he was dark-haired 
and had a moustache. When I no- 
ticed later that he was almost bald, 
I realized that something odd was 
going on. Joan, there were seven 
interns at that party. I think all of 
them had me before morning. I 
don’t know how many times. I 
knew what was happening after 



thick, curly red hair was replaced 
by mostly bald. But I didn’t try to 
stop it. Uh . .1 didn’t want it to 
stop. A nympho, huh?” 

“I don’t know, dear, but that’s 
the way I felt late this afternoon. 
Wanted it to happen at last, want- 
ed it to go on happening — and I 
don’t even know what it feels like. 
Go on.” 

“Well, it did go on. I got up 
once and went to the bathroom 
and noticed in the mirror that I 
didn’t have a stitch on and couldn’t 
remember having undressed. 
Didn’t seem to matter. I went back 
to bed, and found that I was feel- 
ing lonely; the party seemed to 
have stopped. 

“Only it hadn’t. A man came in 
and I managed to focus my eyes 
and said, ‘Oh, Ted! Come here.’ 
And he did and we did, and it was 
worse than ever. 

“I woke up about noon with a 
dreadful hangover. Managed to sit 
up and here were my clothes, neat- 
ly folded on a chair, and on the 
bedside table a tray with a ther- 
mos of coffee and some Danish 
pastry and a glass with a note by 
it. It read: ‘Drink this before you 
eat. You’ll need it. Chubby.’ 
Chubby was the one who was al- 
most bald.” 

“A gentlemen. Aside from his 
taste for mass rape.” 

“Chubby was always nice. But 
if anybody had told me that I 
would ever be in bed with Chubby, 
I would have laughed in her face.” 
“Were you ever again?” 

“Oh, yes. I really did appreciate 
the thoughtful little breakfast and 
especially the hangover cure. It 
put me back together. Not good

enough to go on watch but good 
enough to get dressed and back to 
my room.” 

“Were you all right? I mean, 
uh, not caught or anything?” 

“Not even sore. Not anything. 
Wasn’t my time, even if I hadn’t 
been protected with an implant, 
which I was. And one nice thing 
about going to bed with interns, 
almost no chance of picking up an 
infection. No, I was lucky all the 
way, Joan. Oh, no doubt the story 
went the rounds — but I wasn’t the 
only graduate getting it that night 
and that wasn’t the only party. 
Nobody teased me about it. But it 
was a gang bang and I didn’t make 
the slightest move to stop it.” She 
added thoughtfully, “The thing 
that worries me is that I might do 
it again. I know I would. So I 
don’t drink at all any more. I 
know I can’t handle it.” 

“Why, Winnie, you’ve had a 
drink with me, more than once.” 
“That’s not the same thing. Uh, 
if you wanted me to get drunk 
with you — I would. I’d be safe.” 
(Safe! Little does she know.) Eu- 
nice, we haven’t done more than 
snuggle and you know it.) (She’s 
asking you to step up the pace.) 
(Well, I won’t! Not much, any- 
how.) 

«TI7INNIE! Winnie dear! Look 
VV at the time.” 

“Uh? Oh, my heavens! Ten min- 
utes after midnight. I — ” The little 
redhead seemed about to cry. 

“Are you late? He’ll wait. Oh, 
I’m sure he will — for Winnie.” 
“Not late yet. He’s off duty at 
midnight and it takes a while to get 
here. But — Oh, dear, I don’t want 



to leave you. Not when we were — 
I was, anyhow — so happy.” 

“Me, too, darling,” Joan 
agreed, gently untangling herself 
from Winifred’s arms. “But big 
sister is always here. Don’t keep 
your man waiting. Check your lip- 
stick and hair and such in my bath 
if there is any chance that he may 
already be in your room.” 

“Well. All right. Miss Joan, 
you’re good to me.” 

“Don’t you dare call me ‘Miss’ 
at a time like this or swelp me. 
I’ll make you miss your date. 
Rush, rush, hon; go get beautiful. 
Kiss me good night; I’ll be asleep 
before you are out of the bath. 
And, Winsome — no exercises to- 
morrow.” 

“But—” 

“Smile, I didn’t break your dol- 
ly. I want to sleep late and I want 
you to sleep late so that I won’t 
wake up from knowing you are 
fidgeting. You’ll get all the classic 
postures you need in bed tonight. 
Stop blushing. Give him something 
special from me, only don’t tell 
him. Or do, I don’t give a darn. 
Kiss me quick, and let me go to 
sleep.” 

Her maid-chum-nurse kissed 
her not too quickly and left hur- 
riedly. Joan Eunice pretended to 
be asleep when Winifred walked 
silently from the bath through the 
room, on into her own room, and 
the door sealed behind her. 

(Well, twin, you lucked through 
again, didn’t you?) (Eunice, I’ve 
told you time and again that I am 
not going to stroll Gay Street 
while I’m a virgin. Might be habit- 
forming.) (Could be, with our 
cuddly little pet who enjoys a gang

bang. But I didn’t mean her. I 
meant at Safe Harbor.) 

(You call that lucki I call it 
the most frustrating thing that 
ever happened to me. Eunice, I 
needed the Money Hum as badly 
as Jake did.) (I call it luck. Boss 
darling, I may be dead but I can 
still read a calendar. I was steady 
on twenty-eight-and-a-half days 
for more than ten years — and 
we’ve still been on it since we 
amalgamated. We’re fertile as a 
turtle. Myrtle, this minute — and 
will be, for two or three days. Jake 
promised you that the next time 
won’t be frustrating . and you’ll 
be as carefree as a cheerleader I 
told you about. Scan me, Fanny? 
So run, don’t walk, and get that 
implant — about ten o’clock to- 
morrow morning. Unless you plan 
to get us benched right away. Do 
you?) 

(Eunice, you’re talking non — 
No, you’re not. I will do some- 
thing about it. Tomorrow. But 
‘benched right away’ is an exag- 
geration. I’m new at this while 
you’ve been through one preg- 
nancy. But your aunt probably 
watched you like a hawk — ) (She 
did. Elsie Dinsmore had a livelier 
time.) ( — but I’ve sat through 
three, as a husband. ‘Benched’ is 
just a short time at the end. And 
pregnancy doesn’t kill a woman’s 
interest. My angelic first wife Ag- 
nes would have tried it on the way 
to the hospital if I hadn’t had more 
sense about it than she had. Just 
the same. I’ll be good. I’ll be care- 
ful, rather.) 

(Joan, I wasn’t trying to talk 
you out of it. I just didn’t want us 
knocked up by accident. Say 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



through a playful romp with Jud- 
gie Wudgie. Or Alec. But if you 
want, that’s fine. Marry Jake and 
get pregnant at once. Or get preg- 
nant by him and then marry him; 
he might be more tractable.) 

(Eunice, I’m not planning on 
getting married in any hurry if at 
all.) (So? I’ve heard you propose 
to Jake at least four times.) 

(Yes, yes! If Jake agreed, I 
would; I wouldn’t let him down. 
But he won’t, if ever, until these 
legal finagles are cleared up. 
Which might take years. Do you 
remember how long it took to 
get the courts to okay the Sky 
Trails stock conversions? That 
was clear-cut compared with this 
and did not involve as much mon- 
ey. Eunice, I propose to Jake for 
his morale; I don’t care whether 
he makes an ‘honest woman’ of 
me or not, I just want him to take 
us to bed. Marriage doesn’t fi- 
gure.) 

(Twin, your naivete surprises 
me. Didn’t you hear Winnie? Mar- 
riage isn’t planned, it just happens. 
No girl is more likely to wind up 
in a hotel room, married to a man 
she didn’t even know at sundown 
the night before, than a chick who 
isn’t going to get married ‘any 
time soon.’ Boss, you marry Jake. 
Marry him as soon as he will 
agree to it — for you were talking 
sense when you pointed out that 
no other man could both under- 
stand you and not be dazzled by 
your money. In the meantime, it’s 
smart to go contra.) 

(All right. What are the girls 
using today?) (Oh, most of them 
use implants. Some use pills, 
both the daily ones and the month- 

109 




ly ones. But if you miss with eith- 
er sort, you are on a very short 
fuse. I never liked monkeying with 
my body’s economy; I’m not con- 
vinced that anything that changes 
a woman’s femaleness that much 
is a good idea. Not superstition. 
Boss, I did some careful reading 
after the time I got caught. There 
are hazards to all chemical meth- 
ods. My body worked fine the way 
it was; I didn’t want to tamper 
with a successful organization^ 
I’m quoting you, only you were 
talking about business.) (I see 
your point, Eunice, even though 
we’re talking about monkey busi- 
ness. A body is far more complex 
than a corporation, and the one 
you turned over to me is a jewel; 
I don’t want to tamper with it, 
either. But what did you use? Self- 
restraint?) 

(Never had any in stock, dearie. 
Oh, there are lots of other loving 
things you can do without getting 
pregnant — if you can shake off 
your early training and be twenty- 
first century — ) (Look, infant, I 
knew about — and used — every one 
of those other things in high 
school. I keep telling you: You 
kids did not invent sex.) (You 
didn’t let me finish. Boss. Those 
are emergency measures. A girl 
who depends on them alone is go- 
ing to add to the population ex- 
plosion. Joan, I looked into it 
carefully when I turned eighteen 
and was licensed . and settled on 
one of the oldest methods. A dia- 
phragm. They are still available; 
any physician will fit them. I wore 
one six days every month, even at 
the office — because, as the doctor 
pointed out, most diaphragm fail- 



ures result from leaving them at 
home while you run out for pound 
of sugar, be right back.) 

(I suspect he’s right, Eunice.) 
(I’m sure of it, Joan. I never liked 
them — I never liked any contra- 
ception; I seemed to have a deep 
instinct that told me to get preg- 
nant. Boss . the thing — the only 
thing — that I really mind about be- 
ing dead... is that I always 
wanted to have a baby by you. And 
that’s silly, as you were already 
too old — or maybe almost too old 
— when I first met you. But I 
would have tried if you had of- 
fered.) 

(Darling, darling!) 

(Oh, I’m happy with what I have. 
Om Mani Padme Hum. I’m not 
kicking about my karma. I’m not 
just content. I’m happy... to be 
half of Joan Eunice.) 

(Eunice, would you still be will- 
ing to have a baby by me?) 

(What? Boss, don’t joke about 
it. Don’t mock me.) 

(I’m not joking, beloved.) 

(But, Boss, the necessary part 
of you is gone. Pickled in alcohol, 
or something.) 

(They use formalin, I think. Or 
deep freeze. I’m not talking about 
that old wreck we discarded. We 
can go down and get an implant.) 

(Huh? I don’t understand.) 

(Do you remember a tax-de- 
ductible called the Johanna Muel- 
ler Schmidt Memorial Eugenics 
Foundation?) 

(Of course. I wrote a check for 
it every quarter.) 

(Eunice, despite the purposes 
set out in its charter, the only real 
purpose does not appear in the 
fine print. When my son was killed

I was already fairly old. But I was 
still virile — potent— and tests 
showed that I was fertile. So I got 
married — I think I told you — to 
have another son. Didn’t work. 
But I had my bet hedged and never 
told anyone. Sperm bank deposit. 
In the cryogenic vault of the Foun- 
dation is a little piece of Johann. 
Hundreds of millions of extremely 
little pieces, that is. Presumably 
they are not dead, just asleep. 
That’s what I meant by an implant. 
With a syringe. Or however they 
do it.

(I’m crying. Boss. Can’t a girl cry

can change your mind up till the 
last minute.) 

(I’ll never change my mind. I 
hope you won’t.) 

(Beloved.)

N ext morning Joan found that 
Jake had left the house before 
she woke; there was a note on her 
tray: 

" Dear Joan Eunice, 

“/ slept like a baby and feel 
ready to fight wildcats — thanks to 
you and Winnie. Please extend my 
thanks to her and say (to both of 
you) that / will most gratefully 
join your prayer meetings any 
time I am invited — especially if 
I’ve had a tiring day. 

“I will not be back until late — 
treasure hunting, locating links of 
evidence. Alec is off to Washing- 
ton for one link. If you need me, 
call my answering service or Judge 
McCampbell’s chambers. 



‘‘I’ve instructed Jefferson Bill- 
ings to let you draw against your 
petty expenditures account — about 
four hundred thousand in it, I be- 
lieve — on your old signature and 
new thumb print. He’ll pay drafts 
and hold them and I’ll counter- 
sign until you make out a new sig- 
nature & thumbprint card — he 
says he knew Eunice Branca by 
sight, no problem. If you wish, he 
will call on you with a new sig- 
print card — we assume that your 
signature is now somewhat 
changed.” 

(Boss, I guess Jake doesn’t 
know that I sign your signature 
better than you do.) (I don’t think 
anyone knows, dearest. I don’t 
know how that would figure in 
court — for us, or against us?) 

‘‘‘‘If you need more pocket mon- 
ey, let me make you a personal 
loan rather than have it show in 
my conservator’s report. Your 
‘‘Brother Mac” is most helpful, 
but the financial end of this non- 
sense should appear ultra-conser- 
vative until such time as he can, 
with full justification, relieve me 
as your conservator. Caesar’s 
wife, you know. 

‘‘Spe'aking of Caesar’s wife, I 
told you a chuckle about two of 
our friends. This morning I 
phoned one of them and the other 
answered and, after the usual 
query as to sight cfe sound securi- 
ty, they seemed unworried about 
what I saw or heard or might in- 
fer. I was flattered. Little imp, if 
you must misbehave, you can 
trust them — for they have your 
welfare at heart. Sorry I was stuf- 
fy yesterday. ” 

(I’m glad to learn that. Boss.)

I WILLFEAR NO EVIL 




(Eunice, I can’t see that it’s our 
business what Alec and Mac do in 
their spare time. Jake shouldn’t 
gossip about them, even to us.) 
(No, no. Boss! Jake is telling you 
that he was being a cube yesterday 
— and he’s sorry — and now he’s 
granting you absolution in ad- 
vance. We had best marry Jake — 
nevertheless I’ve fretted that Jake 
might be jealous. Possessive. His 
age, his background. Could be 
doom, twin — as you are a tart at 
heart and we both know it.) 

(Oh, nonsense, Eunice! I would 
never rub Jake’s nose in it — and 
anyhow you’re wrong. A smart 
man — which Jake is — doesn’t get 
excited over a go on the tiles; what 
worries him is fear of losing a wife 
he values. If Jake marries us, I 
will never let him worry about los- 
ing us.) (I hope you can make that 
stick. Boss honey.) (With your 
help I’m sure I can. Let’s finish 
his letter — ) 

“Don’t count on me for dinner, 
as what I must do today is urgent 
— more urgent than something 
that seemed dreadfully urgent yes- 
terday. And was. And will be, I 
hope. 

“This was meant to be a love 
letter but I’ve had to mention oth- 
er matters — and other people, so I 
must urge you to tear it up and 
flush it down the W. C. It is no ac- 
cident that I am thumb-printing 
the seal and will hand it to Cun- 
ningham with a promise to have 
his head on a platter if it leaves his 
person before it reaches you. I’ve 
learned to like Cunningham; he’s 
an ‘honest thief’ 

“My love to you, dearest, and 
the biggest kiss possible — so big

that you can break off a piece and 
deliver it to Winnie when you 
thank her for me. She’s a charm- 
ing girl, and I’m pleased that she’s 
mothering you so well. 

“J." 

(Why, the horny old bastard. 
Joan, Jake has his eye on Winnie’s 
pretty tail while he’s patting ours.) 
(She’ll have to stand in line!) {Jeal- 
ous, twin?) (No. But I repeat — I’m 
going to scalp him first. Darn it, 
Eunice, I had him all set yesterday 
— and it’s been a long struggle. 
Not the Whim-Wham-Thankee- 
Ma’am you managed with him. 
And all it got me was a spanking. 
1 do hope he comes home tonight.) 
(Three hurdles even if he does, 
twin.) {Threel) (Hubert . and 
Winnie... and that ‘implant.’ 
Boss darling? You’re not going to 
do me out of having your baby by 
letting Jake get at you first — are 
you?) (Of course not, little stupid. 
I was coping with intrigues with- 
out getting shot long before your 
grandmother was born. Mmm — 
I’ll need cash!) 

(Jake told you how to get all the 
cash you want.) (Oh, sure — on my 
signature and his countersignature. 
Like a cat covering up on lino- 
leum. Eunice my love. I’ll bet you 
never paid a bribe in your life.) 
(Well . not with money.) (Don’t 
tell me, let me guess. Hon, what 
we’re sitting on might be worth a 
million — but today I need used 
bills in medium denominations 
from no recorded source. Come 
along, little snoopy, and I’ll show 
you something that even my secre- 
tary — a sweetly deceitful girl 
named Eunice, remember her? — 

GALAXY 




didn’t know anything about.) 

(Do you mean that safe hidden 
in your bath, Boss?) {Huhl How 
the hell did you know about that‘s) 
(I’m snoopy.) (Do you know the 
combo?) (I ought to take the 
Fifth.) (Why bother? You’ll know 
it in two minutes. Or can you pick 
it out of my mind?) (Boss darling, 
you know by now that I don’t 
know anything in your memory 
until you think about it . and 
you don’t know anything in mine 
until I think about it. But — Well, 
if 1 had to open that safe, I think I 
would start with the numbers that 
mean your mother’s birthday.) 

Joan sighed. (A girl doesn’t have 
any privacy these days. All right, 
let’s see if we’ve been robbed.) 

S HE went into her bath, sealed 
the door, bolted it by hand, re- 
moved a stack of towels from a 
lower cabinet, fiddled with the ceil- 
ing of the cabinet; the back panel 
slid aside, disclosing a safe. (You 
think my mother’s birth date will 
open it?) (I’d switch on the sun 
lamps over the massage table first, 
then run the cold water in the hand 
basin.) (No privacy at all! Honey, 
did you really pay a bribe with 
your pretty tail once?) (Not ex- 
actly. I just improved the situa- 
tion. Let’s see if we’ve been 
robbed.) 

Joan opened the safe. Inside was 
money enough to interest a bank 
auditor. But the packets had not 
been packaged in a bank; they were 
not that neatly jogged and the to- 
tal for each was hand printed. 
(Plenty of moola, dear — and eith- 
er nobody found this safe or they 
never figured out the additional 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



bolts. Either way, it settles one 
thing. We won’t put Jake’s sweet 
note down the hopper.) (Let him 
think we did, huh?) (If he asks.) 
(Then cry on him later and admit 
that we couldn’t bear to part with 
it.) (Eunice, you have a mind like 
a pretzel.) (That’s why it fits so 
well into yours, twin.) (Could be.) 

Joan put the letter inside, took 
out two packets, put them in a 
purse into the dressing-room end 
— closed the safe, shut off the sun 
lamps, shut off the water, spun the 
dial, slid the panel back, replaced 
the towels, closed the cabinet. 
Then she stepped to the bath’s in- 
tercom, pressed a touchplate. 
“Chief O’Neil.” 

“Yes, Miss Smith?” 

“I want my car, one driver and 
both Shotguns in thirty minutes.” 
There was a short silence. “Uh, 
Miss Smith. Mr. Salomon appar- 
ently forgot to mention that you 
would be leaving the house.” 

“For excellent reason. He did 
not know it. Did he mention that I 
am no longer a ward of the court? 
If not, have you learned it from 
some other source?” 

“Miss, I haven’t learned it from 
an official source.” 

“I see. Then you are learning it 
from me. Officially.” 

“Yes, Miss.” 

“You don’t sound happy, 
O’Neil. You could check by phon- 
ing Judge McCampbell.” 

“Why, yes, of course.” 

“Are you going to, O’Neil?” 
“Perhaps I misunderstood. 
Miss. Weren’t you telling me to?” 
“Are you recording?” 

“Certainly, Miss. I always do, 
with orders.”

“I suggest that you play it back 
and answer your own question. I’ll 
hold. But first — how long have 
you been with me, O’Neil?” 

“Seventeen years, Miss. The last 
nine as your Chief.” 

“Seventeen years, two months, 
and some days. Not enough for 
maximum retirement but it has 
been long, faithful, and unques- 
tioning service. You can retire this 
morning on full pay for life, if you 
wish, O’Neil; faithful service 
should be appreciated. Now please 
play back while I hold.” She 
waited. 

“Be switched. Miss — I must 
need a hearing aid. You didn’t tell 
me to call the Judge. You just said 
I could." 

“That is correct. I pointed out 
that you could check on what I 
told you — officially — by making 
such a call. You still can.” 

“Uh, Miss, I don’t see what you 
are driving at.” 

“I’m sure you can figure it out. 
Do you wish to retire today? If so, 
send up Mentone; I want to inter- 
view him.” 

“Miss, I’ve no wish to retire at 
all.” 

“Really? You gave the impres- 
sion that you were looking for an- 
other job. Perhaps with Mr. Salo- 
mon. If so, I do not want to stand 
in your way. Retirement at full 
pay is available to you, O’Neil.” 

“Miss, I like it here.” 

“I’m pleased to hear it. I hope 
you will stay for many years. 
O’Neil, have you ever discussed 
my comings and goings with any- 
one?” 

“Only when you’ve told me to. 
Miss. In which case I always have 

114 



your order to do so on tape.” 
“Fine. Wipe this tape and I’ll 
hold while you do so.” 

Shortly he said, “Wiped, Miss 
Smith.” 

“Good. Let’s start over. Chief 
O’Neil, this is Miss Johann Sebas- 
tian Bach Smith speaking. I want 
my car, one driver, and both Shot- 
guns in thirty minutes.” 

“They will be ready. Miss 
Smith.” 

“Thank you. I’ll be shopping. Is 
there anything I can pick up for 
Mrs. O’Neil?” 

“That’s most kind of you. Miss. 

I don’t think so. Shall I ask her?” 
“If you do, it is only necessary 
to say that my car is going out. If 
she has a list. I’ll be happy to have 
Fred or Shorty take care of it. 
Off.” 

(Boss, you scared the pee out of 
him. Was that nice?) (Running a 
feudal enclave in the midst of a 
nominal democracy isn’t easy, Eu- 
nice. When Johann said ‘Frog’ ev- 
erybody hopped — my security boss 
especially. O’Neil has got to know 
— they’ve all got to know — that 
Johann is still here . and that no 
one, not even darling Jake, reviews 
or vetoes what I say. Unless he 
marries us, in which case I’ll go 
female and let him decide every- 
thing.) (That’ll be the day!) (I 
might, dear one. Tell me, did you 
obey Joe?) (Well... I never 
bucked him. I suppose you could 
say I obeyed him. Except that I 
fibbed, or sometimes kept my 
mouth shut.) (I’d do just about the 
same. I think a perfect arrange- 
ment would be to do exactly what 
a man tells me to do . but wan- 
gle it so that he tells me to do what 

GALAXY 




I’ve already decided to do.) 

Joan felt, rather than heard, her 
chuckle. (Boss, that sounds like a 
recipe for a perfect marriage.) 

(I find I like being female. But 
it’s different. Now what shall we 
wear?) 

J OAN settled on a bandeau, a 
knee skirt, an opaque cloak 
with hood and yashmak, plus low- 
heeled sandals, all in subdued col- 
ors. She was ready in less than 
thirty minutes. 

(How’s our face, Eunice?) 
(Okay for a shopping trip. No 
need to call Winnie; the little bag- 
gage probably hasn’t had much 
sleep.) (Nor do I want to call her; 
she might want to come along. 
Let’s go, sweet — we’re out to 
break a two-thousand-year record 
with no help from the Holy 
Ghost.) (Boss, that’s not a nice 
way to talk!) (Well, I’ll be 
frimped! Eunice, I thought you 
weren’t a Christian? Zen. Or Hin- 
duist. Or some such.) 

(I’m not any of those things. 
Boss. I simply know some useful 
spiritual disciplines. But it is rude 
to joke about anything someone 
else holds holy.) (Even in my 
mincf! Are you telling me what I 
must not think! If I could reach 
you. I’d spank you.) (Oh, you can 
say anything to me. Boss — ^just 
don’t say such things out loud.) 
(I didn’t and don’t and never have. 
Quit nagging me.) (Sorry, Boss. 
Love you.) (Love you, little nag. 
Let’s go get knocked up.) (Fej!) 

She took the front lift to the 
basement; O’Neil met her and sa- 
luted. “Car is ready. Miss — and 
both drivers and both Shotguns.” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“Why both drivers?” 

“Well, Finchley should be on 
call. But Dabrowski is bucking my 
authority a touch. Claims he’s sen- 
ior to Finchley. Do you wish to 
settle it?” 

“Of course not; you must. But 
perhaps I can smooth some feath- 
ers.” 

“Yes, Miss.” 

He conducted her to her car; 
both teams were lined up by it, 
they saluted in unison. She smiled 
at them. “Good morning, friends. 
I’m glad to see you all looking so 
well. It’s been a long time.” 

Dabrowski answered for them, 
“It has indeed. Miss Smith — and 
we are glad to see you looking so 
well.” 

“Thank you.” Her eyes traveled 
across them. “There is one thing 
no one has told me . about the 
tragedy that started this strange 
sequence of events. Which team 
was driving the night Mrs. Branca 
was killed?” 

For a long moment no one 
spoke. Then O’Neil answered, 
“Finchley and Shorty had the duty 
that night. Miss Smith.” 

“Then I must thank them — for 
Mrs. Branca and for myself. Al- 
though I know that Dabrowski 
and Fred would have acted as 
bravely, as promptly.” She looked 
at Finchley, then at Shorty, her 
face unsmiling but serene. “Which 
one of you avenged Eunice? Or 
was it both of you?” 

Finchley answered. “Shorty got 
him, Mrs. — Miss Smith. Bare 
hands, one chop. Broke his neck.” 
She turned to Shorty — six feet 
six of smooth-black soul, two hun- 
dred ninety pounds of sudden 

115 




death — and a preacher in his time 
off. She looked up at him and said 
gently, “Shorty, from the bottom 
of my heart — for Eunice Branca — 
I thank you.” (I do thank him. 
Boss! This is news to me. I was 
dead before that lift opened.) “If 
she were here, she would thank 
you — not just for herself but for 
other girls that killer will never 
kill. I’m glad you killed him in the 
act. If he had gone to trial he 
might be out by now. Doing it 
again.” 

Shorty had said nothing up to 
then. “Miss — Finch got ’im, too. 
Zapped him. Couldn’t rightly say 
which one got him first.” 

“Nor does it matter. Any of 
you four would have protected 
Mrs. Branca with your life. She 
knew it — and knows it, wherever 
she is. I know it, and Chief O’Neil 
knows it.” Joan felt tears start, 
let them flow. “I — all of us — wish 
to Heaven she had waited indoors 
until you two arrived. I know that 
each of you would rather see me 
dead than her. I ask you to do me 
the honor of believing that I feel 
the same way. Shorty, will you say 
a prayer for her tonight? For me? 
I don’t know much about pray- 
ing.” (Damn it. Boss, you’ve got 
me crying.) (Then say a Money 
Hum. For Shorty. He’s still blam- 
ing himself for the unavoidable.) 

“I will, Miss. I have every night. 
Although — Mrs. Branca — doesn’t 
need it. She went straight to Heav- 
en.” (So I did. Boss. Though not 
the way Shorty thinks.) (And we 
shan’t tell him. Have I said 
enough?) (I think so.) 

Joan said, “Thank you. Shorty. 
For me, not for Eunice. As you 

116 



say, Eunice doesn’t really need 
prayers.” She turned to O’Neil. 
“Chief, I want to go to Gimbel’s 
Compound.” 

“Certainly, Miss. Uh, Finchley, 
man the car. Both Shotguns.” 
O’Neil helped her in, locked her 
in; she locked herself in. The ar- 
mor door lifted and the big car 
rolled out into the street. (Joan, 
what in the world are you going to 
buy at Gimbel’s?) (A gag. For 
you. I’ll change that order in a 
moment. Eunice, where did you 
buy clothes? You were the most 
smartly dressed gal in town — even 
when you were the nakedest.) 

(Pooh, I was never naked; Joe’s 
designs made all the difference. 
Joan, where I shopped you would 
never shop.) (Can’t see why not.) 
(Johann might but you can’t; it 
wouldn’t do. Mmm . while I 
could not afford the stylish places, 
I know of them. Come to think of 
it, two of them lease space inside 
Gimbel’s Compound.) (So that’s 
where we’ll go — second. I’ll tell 
Finchley the change . and tell 
him to have Fred escort me; I 
think Fred feels left out.) (Wups! 
Fred can read.) (So? Oh\ Well, 
Fred can guard me later.) She 
thumbed the order switch. 

“Finchley?” 

“Yes, Miss?” 

“I got so preoccupied that I for- 
got one other stop. Please drop 
Shorty and me at the unloading 
zone where State passes over 
Main.” 

“State and Main, Miss.” 

“Please have Shorty hang the 
radio link on his belt; there’s no 
parking around there. Or was not 
the last time I was down town. 



GALAXY 




How long has that been? Over two 
years.” 

“Two years and seven months, 
Miss. Sure you don’t want both 
Shotguns with you?” 

“No, they can take turns stay- 
ing with the car. If you have to get 
out, I want you covered.” 

“Oh, I’ll be all right. Miss.” • 
“Don’t argue with me. You 
wouldn’t have argued when I was 
old Johann Smith; I assure you 
that Miss Johann Smith still has 
his poison fangs. Pass the word 
along.” 

She heard him chuckle. “I’ll do 
that. Miss Smith.” 

W HEN the car stopped, Joan 
hooked up her yashmak, con- 
cealing her identity — either or both 
of them — from the curious. 
Shorty unlocked her and handed 
her out. On the crowded pedestrian 
walk of Main Street Joan felt sud- 
denly vulnerable . except for the 
tower of strength beside her. 
“Shorty, the building I’m looking 
for is in the thirteen hundred block 
— thirteen-oh-seven. Can you find 
it?” The question made him feel 
useful; she knew where the Roberts 
Building was, she owned it. 

“Oh, sure. Miss — I read num- 
bers real good. Letters, too — ^just 
words bother me.” 

“Let’s go then. Shorty, how do 
you manage in your real profes- 
sion? Not being able to read the 
Bible, I mean.” 

“No trouble, I use talking 
books — and as for the Book, I 
got every precious word memo- 
rized.” 

“A remarkable memory. I wish 
I could say the same.” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“Just takes patience. I had the 
Book down pat while I was still in 
prison.” He added thoughtfully, 
“Sometimes I think I ought to 
learn to read . but I can’t seem 
to find time.” (The poor dear 
probably never had a teacher who 
could teach. Boss.) (Never tamper 
with a successful organization, Eu- 
nice; he’s found his niche.) 

“This must be it. Miss. ‘One, 
three, oh, seven.’ ” 

“Thank you. Shorty.” She was 
not asked for her ID at the build- 
ing entrance, nor did she offer it, 
for she had none, either as Johann 
Smith or Eunice Branca. The 
guard noted the “Licensed & Dep- 
utized” shield (which matched his 
own) on Shorty’s uniform, re- 
leased the cage turnstile and waved 
them on through. Joan Eunice 
smiled at him with her eyes — and 
made note that security at the 
Roberts Building should be tight- 
ened; the guard should have photo- 
graphed Shorty’s ID and logged 
his shield number. (Boss, he can’t 
handle so many people that way; 
he has to use his judgment.) (Look 
who’s talking! If that apartment 
house you used to live in had had 
tight security, you would never 
have been mugged. If we can’t 
stop violence outdoors, we must 
try to keep it from coming in- 
doors.) (I won’t argue. Boss dar- 
ling — I’m excitedl) (Me, too; this 
veil is a help.) 

On the twelfth floor they went 
to the suite occupied by the Jo- 
hanna Mueller Schmidt Memorial 
Eugenics Foundation, H.S. Olsen, 
M.D., Sc.D., Director, Please 
Ring and Wait. The guard let 
them in, went back to his picture 



117 




magazine. Joan noted with approv- 
al that there was a goodly number 
of women and couples in the wait- 
ing room. She (Johann) had jacked 
up Olsen about the (public) pur- 
pose of the Foundation — to offer 
superior anonymous donors to li- 
censed and qualified females — in 
her last letter accompanying a 
quarterly check; apparently it had 
had good effect. 

“Wait here, Shorty; there’s vid- 
eo over there.” 

She went to the barrier desk sep- 
arating the waiting room from the 
outer clerical office, avoided the 
sign “Applications” and got the 
reluctant attention of the only 
male back of the barrier, motioned 
him to her. “What is it. Ma’am? 
If it’s an application, go to the far 
end, present your ID and fill out 
the questionnaire, then wait. You’ll 
be called.” 

“I want to see the Director. Dr. 
Olsen.” 

“Dr. Olsen never sees anyone 
without an appointment. Give me 
your name and state your business 
and possibly his secretary will see 
you.” 

She leaned closer, spoke softly. 
“I must see him. Tell him that my 
husband has found out.” 

The office manager looked star- 
tled. “Your name?” 

“Don’t be silly. Just tell him 
that.” 

“Uh . wait here.” He disap- 
peared through a rear door. 

She waited. After a remarkably 
short time he appeared at a side 
door of the waiting room, mo- 
tioned her to him, then conducted 
her down a passage toward a door 
marked “Director — Keep out” 

118 



and to a door near it marked 
“Secretary to the Director, Ring 
& Wait.” There he left her with a 
woman who reminded Joan of Jo- 
hann’s third-grade teacher, both in 
appearance and authoritarian man- 
ner. The woman said frostily, 
“What is this nonsense? You may 
start by showing me your ID.” 
(Three fingers stiff into her solar 
plexus. Boss, and say she fainted!) 
(Maybe. We’ll try my way first.) 

Joan answered in still more for- 
mal tones, “Not likely. Miss Per- 
kins. Why do you think I’m veiled? 
Will you announce me? Or do I 
call the police and the news 
snoops?” 

Miss Perkins looked startled, 
left her stenodesk and entered the 
private office behind it. She came 
out shortly and said angrily, “You 
may go in.” 

Olsen did not get up as Joan en- 
tered. He said, “Madam, you have 
chosen an unusual way of getting 
my attention. Now what is it? 
Come to the point.” 

“Doctor, don’t you offer chairs 
to ladies?” 

“Certainly. If they are ladies. A 
point you have gone to some trou- 
ble to render dubious. Speak up, 
my good woman, or I shall have 
you removed.” (Boss, did you see 
him glance at the mike? That old 
bat in the next room is taking 
down every word.) (So I assumed, 
Eunice. So we won’t talk yet.) 
Joan stepped close to the Doctor’s 
desk, unhooked her yashmak, let 
it fall to her left shoulder. 

T he DOCTOR’S expression 
changed from annoyance to 
startled recognition. Joan Eunice

leaned across his desk, flipped off 
the dictation microphone. Then 
she said quietly, “Anything else 
still recording? Is this room sound- 
proof? How about that door?” 
“Miss—” 

“‘Miss’ is enough. Are you 
ready to ask me to sit down? Or 
shall I leave — and return with my 
lawyer?” 

“Do please sit down — Miss.” 
“Thank you.” Joan waited until 
he got up and moved a chair to a 
correct “honored-guest” position 
near his own. She sat down. “Now 
answer the rest. Are we truly pri- 
vate? If we are not — and you tell 
me that we are — I will eventually 
know it... and will take such 
steps as I deem appropriate.” 

“Uh, we’re private. But just a 
moment.” He got up, went to his 
secretary’s door, bolted it manual- 
ly. “Now, Miss, please tell me 
what this is about.” 

“I shall. First, I’ve been supple- 
menting my original endowment 
with quarterly checks. Have you 
been receiving these during my in- 
capacitation?” 

“Eh . one check failed to ar- 
rive. I waited six weeks, then wrote 
to Mr. Salomon and explained 
what your custom had been. It 
seems he checked the facts, for 
soon after we received two quar- 
terly payments at once, with a let- 
ter saying that he would continue 
to authorize payments in accor- 
dance with your custom. Is there 
some difficulty?” 

“No, Doctor. The Foundation 
will continue to receive my sup-., 
port. Let me add that the trustees 
are — on the whole — satisfied with 
your management.” 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



“That’s pleasing to hear. Is that 
why you came today? To tell me 
that?” 

“No, Doctor. Now we get to the 
purpose. Are you quite certain that 
our privacy cannot be breached? 
Let me add that the answer is far 
more important to you than it is 
to me.” 

“Miss, uh — Miss, I am cer- 
tain.” 

“Good. I want you to go into 
the cold vault, obtain donation 
551-20-0052 — I will go with you 
and check the number — and then I 
want you to impregnate me with it. 
At once.” 

The Doctor’s face broke in as- 
tonishment. Then he regained his 
professional aplomb and said, 
“Miss — that is impossible.” 

“Why? The purpose of our insti- 
tution, as defined in its charter — 
which I wrote — is to supply quali- 
fied females with donor sperm — 
on request, without fee and with- 
out publicity. That’s exactly what 
I want. If you wish to give me a 
physical examination. I’m ready. If 
you want to know whether or not 
this body is licensed for child-bear- 
ing, I assure you that it is — al- 
though you know that in this case 
a fine for unlicensed pregnancy 
means less than nothing. What’s 
the trouble? Does it take too long 
to prepare the sperm to do it all in 
one day?” 

“Oh, no, we can have it warmed 
and viable in thirty minutes.” 
“Then impregnate me thirty 
minutes from now.” 

“But, Miss — do you realize the 
trouble I could get into?” 

“What trouble?” 

“Well ... I do follow the news. 

119 




Or I would not have recognized 
you. I understand that there is a 
question of identity — ” 

“Oh, that.” Joan dismissed it. 
“Doctor, do you bet on the races?” 
“Eh? I’ve been known to. Why?” 
“If we are truly private you 
can’t possibly get into trouble. But 
there comes a time in every man’s 
life when he must bet. You are at 
such a crisis. You can bet on a 
certain horse — on the nose, you 
can’t hedge your bet. And win. Or 
lose. As you know, the other trus- 
tees of.this corporation are my 
dummies; I am the Foundation. 
Let me predict what will come to 
pass. Presently this identity non- 
sense will be over and the real Jo- 
hann Sebastian Bach Smith will 
stand up. At that time the endow- 
ment of this institution will be 
doubled. At that same time the 
salary of the director will be dou- 
bled. If you bet on the right horse, 
you will be the director. If not — 
you’ll be out of a job.” 

“You’re threatening me!” 

“No. Prophesying. Old Johann 
Sebastian Bach Smith was a sev- 
enth son of a seventh son, born un- 
der a caul; he had the gift of 
prophecy. No matter which way 
you bet, the endowment will be 
doubled. But only you and I will 
ever know what is done today.” 
“Mmmm . there are proce- 
dures to satisfy. I do have authori- 
ty to permit any adult female to 
receive a sperm donation if I am 
satisfied that she qualifies — and 
let’s say that I am. Nevertheless 
there are routines to go through, 
records that must be kept.” 

(He’s ready to geek. Boss. So 
sing him a ‘Money Hum,’ with a 

120 



different tune.) (Eunice, a cash 
bribe is to push him over if he 
won’t fall. Let’s see if he’ll sell it 
to himself.) 

Joan shook her head. “No rec- 
ords. Just do it to me and I’ll hook 
my veil over my face and leave.” 

“But, Miss — I don’t do these 
things myself. A staff doctor car- 
ries out the donation procedure, 
assisted by a nurse. They would 
think it strange if no records were 
kept. Very.” 

“No nurses. No assistants. You 
alone. Doctor. You are an M.D. 
and a specialist in genetics and eu- 
genics. Either you can do this . 
or you don’t know enough to head 
this institution — which the trustees 
would regretfully notice. Besides 
that, I go with you and check the 
number on that donation . and 
stick at your elbow until you place 
it inside me. Do we understand 
each other?” 

The Doctor sighed. “I once 
thought a general practice was 
hard work! We can’t be sure that a 
placed donation will result in im- 
pregnation.” 

“If not. I’ll be back in twenty- 
eight and a half days. Doctor, quit 
stalling. Or bet on the other horse 
and I’ll leave. No harsh words, 
now or later. Just that prophecy.” 
She stood up. (Well, Eunice? Will 
the frog hop?) (Can’t guess, dear. 
He’s seen so many female tails he’s 
bored with them. I can’t figure 
him.) 

Olsen suddenly stood up. 
“You’ll need a cold suit.” 

“All right.” 

“Plus the advantage that a cold 
suit covers so thoroughly that a 
man would not recognize his own 

GALAXY 




wife in one. I have a spare here, for 
V.I.P.’s.” 

“I think you could class me as a 
V.I.P.,” Joan said dryly. 



F orty minutes later Dr. Olsen 
said, “Hold still a moment 
longer. I am placing a Dutch cap, 
a latex occlusive cervical pessary, 
over the donation.” 

“Why, Doctor? I thought those 
things were for contraception.” 
“Usually. And it will serve that 
purpose, too — mean to say, some 
of our clients wish to be protected 
at once from any possibility of im- 
pregnation from any other source. 
But in your case my purpose in in- 
stalling this temporary barrier is 
to make certain that the donation 
does impregnate you. To give 
those wigglers a chance to reach 
target and to keep them from 
swimming downstream instead — 
follow me? Leave it in place until 
some time tomorrow — or later, it 
doesn’t matter. Do you know how 
to remove it?” 

“If I can’t get it out. I’ll call 
you.” 

“If you wish. If you fail to skip 
your next menses, we can try again 
in four weeks.” Dr. Olsen lowered 
the knee supports, offered his 
hand. She stepped down and her 
skirt fell into place. She felt 
flushed and happy. (Eunice, it’s 
done!) (Yes, Boss! Beloved Boss.) 

Dr. Olsen picked up her cloak, 
held it ready to lay around her 
shoulders. She said, “Doctor — 
don’t worry about that horse race.” 
He barely smiled. “I have not 
been worrying about it. May I say 
why?” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“Please.” 

“Um. If you recall, I have met 
Johann Smith — Mister Johann 
Smith — on other occasions.” 
“Eleven occasions, I believe, sir, 
including a private interview when 
Dr. Andrews nominated you to 
succeed him.” 

“Yes, Miss Smith. I’ll never for- 
get that interview. Miss, there may 
be some legal point to clear up 
concerning your identity. But not 
in my mind! I do not think that 
any young woman of your present 
physiological age could simulate 
Mr. Johann Smith’s top-sergeant 
manner — and make it stick.” 

“Oh, dear!” 

“Pardon me?” 

“Dr. Olsen, this sex change I’ve 
undergone is not easy to handle. It 
is fortunate — for both of us — that 
you were able to spot Johann 
Smith behind the face I now wear. 
But — darn it, sir! — I’ve got to ac- 
quire manners to match what I am 
now. Will you call on me — oh, say 
three weeks from now when I hope 
to have cheerful news — and let me 
show you that I can simulate a 
lady when I try? Come for tea. We 
can discuss how the Foundation’s 
work can be expanded under a 
doubled endowment.” 

“Miss Smith, I will be honored 
to call on you whenever you wish. 
For any reason. Or none.” (Wups! 
Hey, Eunice, I thought you said 
he was bored with female tails?) 
(So I did. But we have an unusual- 
ly pretty one, Joan, even from that 
angle. Gonna kiss him?) (Eunice, 
can’t you treat just one man im- 
personally?) (I don’t know; I’ve 
never tried. Aw, don’t be chinchy; 
he’s been a perfect lamb.) (Now 



121 




you be a lamb, too — let’s get out 
of here.) 

Joan let the doctor lay her cloak 
around her shoulders; it brought 
his head close to hers. She turned 
her face toward that side, wet her 
lips and smiled at him. 

She could see him decide to risk 
it. She did not dodge as his lips 
met hers — but did not put her 
arms around him and let herself be 
slightly clumsy, stiffened a little 
before giving in to it. (Twin! Don’t 
let him put us back on that table — 
make him use the couch in his of- 
fice.) (Neither one, Eunice. Pipe 
down!) 

Joan broke from it, trembling. 
“Thank you. Doctor. And you see 
I can he a girl if I try. How do I 
get back to the waiting room with- 
out passing your Miss Perkins?” 
She hooked her yashmak. 

XVIII 

A few minutes later Shorty hand- 
ed her into her car, locked her 
in, and mounted into the forward 
compartment. “Gimbel’s Com- 
pound, Miss Smith?” 

“Please, Finchley.” 

Once inside the compound Joan 
had Fred escort her to Madame 
Pompadour’s. The fact that she 
had a private bodyguard got her 
immediate attention from the 
manager, who was no Madame 
Pompadour even though he wore 
his hair in the style made famous 
by the notorious Marquise and 
had manners and gestures to 
match. (Eunice, are you sure we 
are in the right place?) (Certainly, 
Boss — wait till you see their 
prices.) “How may I serve Ma- 



dame?” 

“Do you have a private room?” 
“But of course, Madame. Uh, 
there is a waiting room where — ” 
“My guard stays with me.” 

The manager looked hurt. “As 
Madame wishes. If you will walk 
this way — ” (Eunice, shall we walk 
that way?) (Don’t try, twin — ^just 
follow him. Or her, as the case 
may be.) 

Shortly Joan was seated facing 
a low model’s walk; Fred stood at 
parade rest behind her. The room 
was warm; she unfrogged her 
cloak and pushed back its hood 
but left the yashmak over her fea- 
tures. Then she dug into her purse, 
got out a memorandum. “Do you 
have a model who comes close to 
these measurements?” 

The manager studied the list — 
height, weight, shoulders, bust, 
waist, leg. “This is Madame?” 
“Yes. But here is another specs 
list even if you can’t match me. A 
friend for whom I wish to buy 
something pretty and exotic. She’s 
a redhead with pale skin to match 
and green eyes.” Joan had copied 
Winifred’s measurements from 
the exercise records the two had 
been keeping. 

“I see no problems, Madame, 
but in your own case permit me 
to suggest that our great creative 
artist. Chariot, will be happy to 
check these measurements or even 
to design directly on — ” 

“Never mind. I am buying items 
already made up. If I buy.” 
“Madame’s pleasure. May I ask 
one question? Will Madame be 
wearing her own hair?” 

“If I wear a wig it will be the 
same color as my hair, so assume 



122 



GALAXY 




that.” (Eunice, should I buy a 
wig?) (Be patient and let it grow 
out, dear. Wigs are hard to keep 
clean. And they never smell clean.) 
(Then we’ll never wear one.) 
(Smart Boss. Soap and water is 
the world’s greatest aphrodisiac.) 
(I’ve always thought so. Though a 
girl should smell like a girl.) (You 
do, dearie, you do — you can’t help 
it.) 

“Madame’s hair is a beautiful 
shade. And now, since Madame 
indicated that her time is short, 
perhaps it would suit her conven- 
ience to let our accounting de- 
partment record her credit card 
while I alert the two models?” 
(Watch it. Boss!) (I wasn’t a- 
hint the door, dearie.) “I use credit 
cards with several names. Such as 
McKinley, Franklin, and Grant. 
Or Cleveland.” Joan reached into 
her purse, fanned a sheaf of bills. 
“The poor man’s credit card.” 

The manager repressed a shud- 
der. “Oh, goodness, we don’t ex- 
pect our clients to pay cash.” 

“I’m old-fashioned.” 

The manager looked pained. 
“Oh, but it’s unnecessary. If Ma- 
dame prefers not to use her gener- 
al credit account — her priviliege! — 
she can set up a private account 
with Pompadour in only moments. 
If she will permit me to have her 
ID—” 

“Just a moment. Can you read 
fine print?” Joan pointed at a no- 
tice near a portrait of President 
McKinley. “ ‘This note is legal 
tender for all debts, public and pri- 
vate.’ I shan’t get tangled up in a 
computer. I pay cash.” 

“But, Madame — we aren’t set 
up for cash! I’m not certain we 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



could make change.” 

“Well, I don’t want to put you 
to any inconvenience. Fred.” 

“Yes, Miss?” 

“Take me to La Boutique.” 

The manager looked horrified. 
“Please, Madame! I’m sure some- 
thing can be arranged. One mo- 
ment while I speak to our accoun- 
tant.” He hurried away without 
waiting for an answer. 

(Why the fuss. Boss honey? I’ve 
bought endless things for you, 
against your personal-expenditures 
account. Jake said we could use 
it.) (Eunice, I’ve despised those 
moronic machines since the first 
time I was trapped by a book 
club. But I’m not just being balky. 
Today is not a day to admit who 
we are. Later — after we’re out of 
court — we’ll set up a “Susan 
Jones” account for shopping in 
person. If we ever do again. I can 
see it’s a bloody nuisance.) (Oh, 
no, it’s fun! You’ll see, twin. But 
remember — I hold a veto until you 
learn something about clothes.) 
(Sho’, sho’, little nag.) (Who are 
you calling a nag, you knocked-up 
bag?) (Happy about it, beloved?) 
(Wonderfully happy. Boss. Are 
youl) (Wonderfully. Even if it 
wasn’t romantic.) (Oh, but it was! 
We’re going to have your baby!) 
(Quit sniffling.) (I’m not snif- 
fling; you are.) (Maybe we both 
are. Now shut up, here he comes.) 

The manager beamed. “Ma- 
dame! Our accountant says that it 
is perfectly all right to accept 
cash!” 

“The Supreme Court will be 
pleased to hear it.” 

“What? Oh! Madame is jesting. 
Of course there is a service sur- 



123 




charge of ten percent for — ” 

“Fred. La Boutique.” 

“Please, Madame! I pointed out 
to him how unfair that is . and 
found the most wonderful solu- 
tion!” 

“Really?” 

“Truly, Madame. Anything you 
choose to buy. I’ll simply charge 
against my personal account — and 
you can pay me cash. No trouble. 
I’ll be happy to. My bank doesn’t 
make the least fuss over accepting 
cash deposits. Really.” (Watch it. 
Boss; he’ll expect a fat tip.) (If he 
can show us something we want 
he may get it. Cost is no huhu, 
Eunice; we can’t get rid of the 
stuff.) (It’s the principle of the 
thing. Boss.) (Forget it and help 
me spend money.) (All right. But 
we don’t buy unless we like it.) 

F or the next two hours Joan 
spent money — and was dazed to 
discover how expensive women’s 
clothes could be. But she sup- 
pressed her early upbringing and 
paid attention only to an inner 
voice: (Not that one, twin — it’s 
smart but a man wouldn’t like it.) 
(How about this one, Eunice?) 
(Maybe. Have her walk it around 
again, then have her sit down. 
Show some leg.) 

(Here comes ‘Winnie’ again. Is 
that girl a real redhead, Eunice?) 
(Probably a wig but doesn’t mat- 
ter; she’s almost exactly Winnie’s 
size. That would be cute on our 
Winsome. Twin, see what they 
have in fancy gee-strings — green, 
for a redhead. Winnie ought to 
have at least one outfit intended to 
be seen by no one but her new boy 
friend.) (Okay, we’ll give ‘Bob’ a 
treat. Who do you think he is, 

124 



beloved?) (Haven’t the faintest — 
and we don’t want to guess. Do 
we? I just hope he’s nicer to her 
than Paul was.) 

“Mr. duValle? Do you have 
something exotic in a minimum 
gee for a redhead? Green, I sup- 
pose. And matching cups would be 
interesting, too. Something nice — 
and intimate for a bride.” (Bride?) 
(Well, it might help Winnie be- 
come a bride, Eunice — and it 
steers him away from thinking I’m 
buying it for my sweetheart.) 
(Who cares what he thinks?) 

“Jeweled perhaps? Emeralds?” 

“I wouldn’t want a bride to be 
mugged over a wedding present. 
Nor do I wish to buy her some- 
thing more expensive than her 
bridegroom can afford. Bad taste, 
I think.” 

“Ah, but these are synthetic 
emeralds. Just as lovely but quite 
reasonable. Yola dear — come 
with me.” 

Several thousand dollars later 
Joan quit. She was getting hungry 
and knew, from long experience, 
that being hungry made her un- 
willing to spend money. Her sub- 
conscious equated “hungry” with 
“poor” in a canalization it had ac- 
quired in the 1930’s. 

She sent Fred to fetch Shorty 
to help carry while her purchases 
were being packaged and while she 
paid the startling sum. (Eunice, 
where shall we eat?) (There are 
restaurants inside this compound. 
Boss.) (Uh, darn it — no, damn it\ 
— I can’t eat through a yashmak. 
You know what will happen. 
Somebody who watched video yes- 
terday will recognize us. Then the 
news snoops will be on us before 

GALAXY 




you can say medium rare.) (Well 
. how about a picnic?) (Won- 
derful! Eunice, you win another 
Brownie point. But — where can 
we go? A picnic with grass and 
trees and ants in the potato salad 
— but private so I can take off 
this veil . and yet close enough 
that we won’t starve on the way?) 

(I don’t know, Boss, but I’ll bet 
Finchley does.) 

Finchley did know. Shorty was 
appointed to buy the lunch at The 
Hungry Man inside the compound 
— “Get enough for six. Shorty, 
and don’t look at the prices. Be 
lavish. But there must be potato 
salad. And a couple of bottles of 
wine.’’ 

“One is enough. Miss. I don’t 
drink, wine is a mocker, and 
Finchley never drinks when he is 
on call to drive.” 

“Oh, think big. Shorty; I may 
drink a whole bottle myself — 
you can save my soul tomorrow. 
Today is special — my first day of 
freedom!” (Very special, beloved.) 
(Very, very special. Boss!) 

Down into the crosstown chute, 
up onto Express Route South, out 
to the unlimited zone, then fifty 
miles at three hundred feet per 
second — a speed that Finchley did 
not use until Joan was protected 
by full harness plus collision net. 
The fifty miles melted away in 
fifteen minutes and Finchley eased 
it down and over, ready to exit. 
They were not shot at, even where 
Route South skirts the Crater. 

“Finchley? Can I get out of this 
pesky cocoon now?” 

“Yes, Miss. But I’d feel easier 
if you would wear the Swedish 
belt. Some of these drivers are 

I WILLFEAR NO EVIL 



cowboys.” 

“All right. But tell me the in- 
stant I can take it off.” (Eunice, 
the engineer if-that’s-the-word who 
designed if-that’s-the-word these 
goddam straps did not have wom- 
en in mind!) (You’ve got it rigged 
for a man. Boss — of course you’re 
pinching a tit. Move the bottom 
half closer in and shift the upper 
anchor point after we stop; that’s 
the way they rigged it for me. 
Some man has used it since the 
last time I did.) (Jake, probably, 
sometime when his own car was 
laid up. Sweetheart, how many 
things do I have to learn about be- 
ing a woman before I can avoid 
tripping over my feet?) (Thou- 
sands. But you’re doing all right. 
Boss — and I’m always here to 
catch you.) (Beloved. Say, this 
doesn’t look like a picnic country. 
I wonder if Finchley is lost.) 

They were passing through solid 
masses of “bedroom” areas — 
walled enclaves, apartment houses, 
a few private homes. The trees 
looked tired and grass was scarce, 
while the car’s air-conditioning 
system still fought smog. 

But not for long — Finchley 
turned into a secondary freight 
route and shortly they had farms 
on each side. Joan noticed that 
one belonged to her — to a sub- 
sidiary of Smith Enterprises, she 
corrected, and reminded herself 
that she no longer held control. 

N evertheless she noted 

that the guard at a corner 
watch tower seemed alert and the 
steel fence was stout and tall and 
capped with barbed wire and an 
alarm strand, all in good main- 
tenance. But they were past with- 

125 



/ 




out her seeing what was being 
cropped — no matter; Johann had 
never tried to manage that slice 
of the conglom, he had known his 
limitations. (Eunice, what are we 
raising back there?) (Joan, I can’t 
see if you don’t look — and you 
never looked.) (Sorry, dearest. 
Speak up if you don’t like the ser- 
vice.) (I will. I think it was a rota- 
tion crop. This soil has been 
farmed so hard and long that it 
has to be handled carefully.) 

(What happens when the soil no 
longer responds to management?) 
(We starve, of course. What do 
you expect? But before that they’ll 
build on it.) 

(Eunice, it’s got to stop, some- 
where. When I was a boy I was a 
city kid but I could walk in less 
than an hour to green fields and 
uncut woods . woods so private 
I could play Tarzan in my skin. I 
wasn’t ‘just lucky’ — even in New 
York City a boy with five cents 
could ride to farms and woods in 
less time than it took me to walk 
it.) 

(Doesn’t seem possible. Boss.) 
(I know. It’s taken a fast car and 
a professional driver to do what I 
used to do on bare feet — yet this 
isn’t real farm country; these are 
open-air food factories with fore- 
men and time clocks and shop 
stewards and payroll deductions 
and house-organ magazines and 
you name it. A dug well and a tin 
dipper would cause s strike — and 
they’d be justified; those open 
wells and tin dippers spread di- 
sease. Just the same, the tin-dip- 
per era was a good time in this 
country . and this one isn’t. 
Where do we go from herel) 



The inner voice failed to answer. 
Joan waited. (Eunice?) 

(Boss, I don’t know!) 

(Sorry, just sounding off. Eu- 
nice, all my life I did the best I 
knew how with what I had. I didn’t 
waste — shucks, even that white- 
elephant house keeps a lot of peo- 
ple off Welfare. But every year 
things got worse. I used to get 
sour consolation from knowing 
that I wasn’t going to be around 
when things fell to pieces. Now it 
looks like I will be. That’s why I 
say; ‘Where do we go from here?’ 
I don’t know the answer, either.) 

(Boss?) 

(Yes, dearest?) 

(I could see it, too. Moving 
from an Iowa farm to a big city 
made me see it. And I did have 
plans, sort of. I knew you were go- 
ing to die, I couldn’t help but 
know, and I figured that Joe 
would get tired of me some day — 
no kids and no prospect of any, 
and me some day no longer with a 
fine job that took care of every- 
thing Joe needed. I underrated Joe; 
nevertheless I never forgot that he 
could hand me a pink slip any- 
time. So I had plans and saved my 
money. The Moon.) 

(The Moon! Hey, that’s a fine 
idea! Take one of Pan Am’s pack- 
age tours — de-luxe with private 
courier and all the trimmings. Do 
it before we bulge so big we can’t 
climb through a hatch. What do 
you say, little imp?) 

(If you want to.) 

(You don’t sound enthusiastic.) 
(I’m not against it. Boss. But I 
wasn’t saving money for a tourist 
trip. I meant to put my name on 
the list and take the selection 



126 



GALAXY 




exams . and be able to pay the 
difference, since I didn’t have one 
of the subsidized skills. Outmi- 
grate. Permanently.) 

(I’ll be durned! You had this in 
mind — and never said a word?) 
(Why talk about if and when? I 
didn’t plan to do it as long as you 
or Joe needed me. But I did have 
reason to be serious. I told you I 
was licensed for three kids.) 

(Yes, surely. I’ve known it since 
your first security check.) (Well, 
three is a high quota. Boss — more 
than half a child over replacement. 
A woman can be proud of a three- 
baby license. But I wanted more.) 

(So? You can, now. Fines are 
no problem, even though they’ve 
upped them again and made them 
progressive. Eunice, if you want 
babies, this one is just a starter.) 

(Dear Boss. Let’s see how we do 
with this one first. I knew I could 
not afford fines . but Luna has 
no restrictions against babies. 
They want babies. I think we’re 
there.) 

Finchley turned in at a gate — 
Agroproducts, Inc., Joan noticed 
— a competitor. He parked so as 
not to block the gate, then got out 
and went to the guard post. He 
had parked at such an angle that 
Joan could not see what was going 
on, the armor between her and the 
control compartment cut off her 
view. 

Finchley returned, the car rolled 
through the gate. “Miss Smith, I 
was told to hold it under twenty 
miles per hour, so no safety belts 
is okay now.” 

“Thank you, Finchley. How 
much was the bribe?” 

“Oh, nothing to matter. Miss.” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“So? I expect to see it on 
O’Neil’s Friday Report. If it is not 
there, I will have to ask you 
again.” 

“It’ll be there. Miss,” the driver 
answered promptly. “But I don’t 
know yet what the total will be. 
Have to stop at their Administra- 
tion Building and get us cleared 
through a back gate. To where you 
picnic.” 

<< O WHERE we picnic.” Joan 
■I stopped to think. It irked her 
to pay a bribe when her status 'as 
a major competitor (retired, con- 
ceded) entitled her by protocol to 
red-carpet treatment. But she had 
not sent word ahead, a minimum 
courtesy in visiting a competitor’s 
plant to allow him time to sweep 
dirt under the rug or to divert the 
visitor away from things. Indus- 
trial espionage could not with pro- 
priety be conducted at top level. 
“Finchley, did you tell the gate 
guard whom you were driving?” 

“Oh, no. Miss!” Finchley sound- 
ed shocked. “But he checked the 
license even though I tell him it’s 
your car — best to tell; he has a list 
of all private armoreds in the state, 
just like I have. What I tell him 
was. I’m driving guests of Mr. Sal- 
omon . and let him think it was 
a couple of Vips from the Coast 
with a yen to picnic in a safe spot. 
Didn’t tell him anything really, ex- 
cept Mr. Salomon’s name. That 
okay?” 

“Just fine, Finchley.” (Eunice, 
I feel like an interloper, being in- 
side without giving my name. 
Rude.) (Look at it this way. Boss. 
You know who you are. But the 
public doesn’t — not after that 

127 




silly carnival yesterday. I think it’s 
best to be Jake’s guest . which 
is true, in a way.) (I still feel that 
I should tell Finchley to give my 
name to the Chief Agronomist. 
But would the word get out? Or, 
rather, how soon!) (Thirty min- 
utes! Long enough for some clerk 
to phone in and a news copter to 
fly out. Then some snoop will try 
to interview you by loudspeaker 
because the boys won’t let him 
land.) 

(Some picnic!) 

(If he does land. Shorty and Fred 
will be elbowing each other for a 
crack at him. Eager. Too eager. 
Boss, maybe you haven’t noticed, 
but while they call you Miss Smith 
they treat you exactly as they 
treated me. In their heads they 
know you are you . but in their 
guts they feel you are me.) (That’s 
not far wrong, Eunice. In my head 
I am me . but in my guts — your 
pretty belly — I am_voM.) 

(Boss, I like that. We’re the only 
one-headed Siamese twins in his- 
tory. But not everything in our bel- 
ly is me. There’s one wiggler swim- 
ming faster than the rest — and he 
is ‘Johann’, not Joan, not Eunice 
— and if he makes it to the finish 
line, he’s more important than both 
of us put together.) 

(My love, you’re a sentimental- 
ist.) (I’m a slob. Boss. And so are 
you.) (Nolo contendere. When I 
think about Johann and Eunice — 
both dead, really — getting togeth- 
er in Joan to make a baby, I come 
unstuck and want to cry.) (Better 
not, Joan; the car is stopping. 
Boss? How long does it take a wig- 
gler to get there? I know a sperma- 
tozoon has to move several inches 

128 



to reach the ovum — but how fast 
does he swim? (Durned if I know, 
dear. Let’s leave that cork in place 
at least a couple of days. Give the 
little bastard every possible chance. 
(Good!) (Do you know how to take 
it out? Or do we have to see Dr. 
O’Neil? We don’t want to let Win- 
nie in on this.) (Boss, I’ve seated 
them and taken them out so many 
times I can do it in my sleep. No 
fret, Annette. I’ve worn out more 
rubber baby bumpers than most 
girls have shoes.) 

(Bragging. Boasting.) (Only a 
trifle. Boss dearest. I told you I 
had always been an ever-ready. For 
years and years, any day I missed 
was not my idea. I knew my pur- 
pose in life clear back when I was 
a Girl Scout, no breasts and still 
a virgin.) 

Finchley returned to the car, 
spoke after he had buttoned in. 
“Miss?” 

“Yes, Finchley.” 

“Farm boss sends greetings and 
says guests of Counselor Salomon 
are honored guests of Agroprod- 
ucts. No bribe. But he asked if the 
main gate guard had put the 
squeeze; I told him No. Correct?” 

“Of course, Finchley. We don’t 
rat on other people’s employees.” 

“Don’t think he believed me but 
he didn’t push it. He invited you 
both — assumed there was two and 
I didn’t correct it — to stop for a 
drink or coffee on the way out. I 
let him think you might or might 
not.” 

“Thank you, Finchley.” 

T hey continued through the 
farm, came to another high gate; 
Fred got out and pressed a button, 

GALAXY 




spoke to the security office. The 
gate rolled back, closed after them. 
Shortly the car stopped; Finchley 
unlocked the passenger compart- 
ment, offered his hand to Joan 
Eunice. 

She looked around. “Oh, this 
is lovely! I didn’t know there were 
such places left.” 

The spot was beautiful in a sim- 
ple fashion. A little stream, clear 
and apparently unpolluted, mean- 
dered between low banks. On and 
near its banks were several sorts 
of trees and bushes, but they were 
not dense and there was a carpet 
of grass filling the open spaces. 
From its lawnlike texture it had 
apparently been grazed. The sky 
was blue with scattered fair- 
weather cumulus and the sunshine 
was golden warm without being 
too hot. (Eunice, isn’t it grand?) 
(Uh-huh. ’Minds me of Iowa be- 
fore the summer turns hot.) 

Joan Eunice stripped off her 
sandals, tossed them into the car 
on top of her cloak. She wiggled 
her toes. “Oh, delicious! I haven’t 
felt grass under my bare feet for 
more than twenty years. Finchley, 
Shorty, Fred — all of you! If you’ve 
got the sense God promised a 
doorknob, you’ll take off your 
shoes and socks and give your feet 
a treat.” 

Shotguns looked impassive; 
Finchley looked thoughtful. Then 
he grinned. “Miss Smith, you 
don’t have to tell me twice!” He 
reached down and unclicked his 
boots. Joan Eunice smiled, turned 
away and wandered down toward 
the stream, judging that Shorty 
would be less shy if she did not 
stare. 



(Eunice, is Iowa this beautiful? 
Still?) (Parts of it, hon. But it’s 
filling up fast. Take where we 
lived, between Des Moines and 
Grinnell. Nothing but farms when I 
was a baby. But by the time I left 
home we had more commuter 
neighbors than farm neighbors. 
They were beginning to build en- 
claves, too.) (Dreadful. Eunice, 
this country is breeding itself to 
death.) (For a freshly knocked-up 
broad you have an odd attitude to- 
ward reproduction, twin. See that 
grassy spot where the stream 
turns?) (Yes. Why?) (It takes me 
back ... it looks like a stream 
bank in Iowa where I surrendered 
my alleged innocence.) (Well! Nice 
place for it. Did you struggle?) 
(Twin, are you pulling my leg? I 
cooperated.) (Hurt?) (Not enough 
to slow me down. No reason for it 
to. Boss darling, I know how it was 
in your day. But there is no longer 
an issue over tissue. Girls with 
smart mothers have it removed 
surgically when they reach men- 
arche. And some just lose it grad- 
ually and never know where it 
went. But the girl who yells bloody 
murder and bleeds like a stuck pig 
is a rare bird today.) (Infant, I 
must again set you straight. Things 
haven’t changed much. Except that 
people are more open about it 
now. Do you suppose that water is 
warm enough to swim in?) 

(Warm enough. Boss. But how 
do we know it’s clean? No telling 
what’s upstream.) 

(Eunice, you’re a sissy. If you 
don’t bet, you can’t win.) 

(That was true yesterday . but 
today we’re an expectant mother. 
A babbling brook can be loaded 



I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



129 




with nineteen sorts of horribles.) 

(Uh ... oh, hell! If it’s polluted, 
it’d be posted.) (Back here where 
you can’t reach it without being 
passed through two electric gates? 
Ask Finchley; he may know.) 

(And if he says it’s polluted?) 
(Then we go swimming anyhow. 
Boss, as you pointed out, if you 
don’t bet, you can’t win.) (Mmm 
. if he knows it’s polluted. I’m 
chicken. As you pointed out, be- 
loved, we now have responsibilities. 
Let’s go eat. I’m hungry.) {You’re 
hungry? I was beginning to think 
you had given up the habit.) (So 
let’s eat while we can. How soon 
does morning sickness start?) 
(Who dat. Boss? The other time 
the only effect it had was to make 
me hungry morning, noon, and 
night. Let’s eat!) 

Joan Eunice trotted back to- 
ward the car, stopped dead when 
she saw that Shorty was laying the 
car’s folding table — with one place 
setting. “What’s that?” 

“Your lunch. Miss.” 

“A picnic? On a table? Do you 
want to starve the ants? It should 
be on the ground.” 

Shorty looked unhappy. “If you 
say. Miss.” (Joan! You’re not 
wearing panties. If you loll on the 
ground, you’ll shock Shorty — and 
interest the others.) (Spoilsport. 
Oh, all right.) 

“Since it’s set up. Shorty, leave 
it that way. But set three more 
places.” 

“Oh, we eat in the car. Miss — 
we often do.” 

She stamped her foot. “Shorty, 
if you make me eat alone. I’ll 
make you walk home. Whose idea 

130 



was this? Finchley’s? Finchley\ 
Come here!” 

A FEW moments later all four 
sat down at the table. It was 
crowded as Joan had insisted that 
everything be placed on it at once 
— “Just reach,” she explained. “Or 
starve. Is there a strong man here 
who can open that wine bottle?” 
The dexterity with which Shorty 
opened it caused her to suspect 
that he had not always been a tee- 
totaler. She filled her glass and 
Fred’s, then reached for Finchley’s. 
He said, “Please, Miss Smith — 
I’m driving,” and put his hand over 
it. 

“Give it to me,” she answered, 
“for four drops. For a toast. And 
four drops for you. Shorty, for 
the same purpose.” She put about 
a quarter of an inch in each of 
their glasses. “But first — Shorty, 
will you say grace?” 

The big man looked startled, at 
once regained his composure. 
“Miss Smith, I’d be pleased.” He 
bowed his head. (Boss! What’s eat- 
ing you?) (Pipe down! Om Mani 
Padme Hum.) (Oh! Om Mani 
Padme Hum.) (Om Mani Padme 
Hum.) (Om Mani Padme . ) 
“Amen.” 

“Amen!” 

(Om Mani Padme Hum. Amen.) 
“Amen. Thank you. Shorty. 
Now for a toast — which is a sort 
of a prayer, too. We’ll all drink it, 
so it must be to someone who isn’t 
here . but should be.” (Boss! 
You must stop this — it’s morbid.) 
(Mind your own business!) “Will 
one of you propose it?” 

Finchley and Shorty looked at 
each other — looked away. Joan 
caught Fred’s eye. “Fred?” 

GALAXY 




“Uh — Miss, I don’t know 
how!” He seemed upset. 

“You stand up— ’’Joan stood, 
the others followed — “and say 
whatever you like about someone 
who isn’t here but would be wel- 
come. Anyone we all like. You 
name the person to be honored.” 
She raised her glass, realized her 
tears were starting. (Eunice! Are 
you crying? Or am 7? I never used 
to cry!) (Then don’t get me started. 
Boss — I told you I was a senti- 
mental slob.) 

Fred said uncertainly, “A toast 
to . someone we all like . 
and who should be here. And still 
is\” He suddenly looked fright- 
ened. 

“Amen,” Shorty said in sonor- 
ous baritone. “ ‘And still is.’ Be- 
cause Heaven is as close as you’ll 
let it be. That’s what I tell my peo- 
ple, Fred . and in your heart 
you know I’m right.” He poured 
down, solemnly and carefully, the 
symbolic teaspoonful of wine in 
his glass; they all drank. 

Joan said quietly, “Thank you, 
Fred. She heard you. She heard 
you too. Shorty. She hears me 
now.” (Boss! You’ve got them up- 
set — and yourself, too. Tell them 
to sit down. And eat. Tell ’em I 
said to! You’ve ruined a perfectly 
good picnic.) (No, I haven’t.) 
“Finchley. You knew her well. 
Probably better than I did ... for 
I was a cranky old man and she 
catered to my illness. What would 
she want us to do now?” 

“What would . Mrs. Branca? 
. want us to do?” 

“Yes. Did you call her Mrs. 
Brance? Or Eunice?” (They called 
me Eunice, Boss — and after the 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



first week I kissed them hello and 
goodbye and thanked them for 
taking care of me. Even if Jake 
could see. He just pretended not to 
notice.) (Busybody. You’re a sweet 
girl, beloved. Anything more than 
kiss them?) (Heavens, Boss! Even 
getting them to accept a kiss in 
plafce of the tips they wouldn’t take 
took doing.) (I’ll bet! — on you, 
that is — sister tart.) (Knocked-up 
broad.) 

“Uh, I called her Mrs. Branca 
at first. Then she called me Tom 
and I called her Eunice.” 

“All right, Tom, what does Eu- 
nice want us to do? Stand here cry- 
ing? I see tears in your eyes; I’m 
not the only one crying. Would 
Eunice have us spoil a picnic?” 

“Uh — She’d say, ‘Sit down and 
eat.’ ” 

“That she would!” Shorty 
agreed. “Eunice would say, ‘Don’t 
let hot things get cold and cold 
things get hot — eatV ” 

“Yes,” agreed Joan Eunice, sit- 
ting down, “as Eunice was never a 
spoilsport in all her short and 
beautiful life and wouldn’t let any- 
one else be. Especially me, when I 
was cranky. Reach me a drum- 
stick, Fred — no, don’t pass it.” 
Joan took a bite of chicken. 
(Twin, what Shorty said sounded 
like a quotation.) (It was. Boss.) 
(Then you’ve eaten with him be- 
fore.) (With all of them. When a 
team drove me late at night, I al- 
ways invited them in for a bite. 
Joe never minded, he liked them 
all. Shorty he was especially glad 
to see; he wanted Shorty to model 
for him. At first Shorty thought 
Joe was making fun of him — 
didn’t know that Joe rarely joked 

131 




and never about painting. They 
never got to it, though, as Shorty 
is shy — wasn’t sure it was all right 
to pose naked and scared that I 
might show up while he was pos- 
ing. Not that I would have.) (Not 
even once, little imp? Shorty is a 
beautiful tower of ebony.) (Boss, 
I keep telling you — ) ( — that nud- 
ity doesn’t mean anything to your 
generation. Depends on the skin, 
doesn’t it? / would enjoy seeing 
our black giant — and that goes 
for Johann as well as for Joan.) 
(Well — ) (Take your time think- 
ing up a fib; I’ve got to make con- 
versation.) “Tom, do you have 
those mustard pickles staked out 
or may I have some? Shorty, you 
sounded as if you had sampled 
Eunice’s cooking. Could she 
cook?” 

Finchley answered, “You bet 
she could!” 

“Real cooking? Anybody can 
flash a prepack — and that’s what 
kids nowadays seem to think is 
cooking.” (Boss, I’ll spit in your 
soup!) “But what could she have 
done faced with flour and lard and 
baking powder and such?” 

“Eunice would have done just 
fine,” Shorty said quietly. “True, 
she mostly never had time for real 
cooking — but when she did — or 
whatever she done, anyways — she 
done just perfect.” 

(My fan! Boss — give him a 
raise.) (No.) (Stingy.) (No, Eu- 
nice. Shorty killed the vermin who 
killed you. I want to do something 
for him. But it can’t be money, he 
would not accept it.) 

“She was an artist,” agreed 
Fred. 

“You mean ‘artist’ in the gen- 



eral sense. Her husband was, I re- 
call, an artist in the usual sense. 
A painter. Is he a good one? I’ve 
never seen any of his work. Do 
any of you know?” 

Finchley said, “I guess that’s a 
matter of opinion. Miss Smith. I 
liked Joe Branca’s paintings — but 
I don’t know anything about art; 
I just know what I like. But — ” He 
grinned. “Can I tell on you. Shor- 
ty?” 

“Aw, Tom!” 

« VOU were flattered, you know 
* you were. Miss Smith, Joe 
Branca wanted to paint that big 
ape on your right.” 

(Bingo\) (Trouble, Eunice?) 
“And did he. Shorty?” 

“Well, no. But he did ask me. 
He did.” (Don’t you see. Boss? 
This is that clincher. A fact you 
first learned from me and nowhere 
else . and then had confirmed to 
the hilt. Now you know I’m me.) 
(Oh, piffle, darling.) (But, Boss — ) 
(I’ve known you were you all 
along, beloved. But this isn’t proof. 
Once I knew that Joe and Shorty 
had met, it was a logical necessity 
that Joe would want him to model 
— any artist would want to paint 
him.) 

(Boss, you make sick! It’s 
proof. I’m me.) (Beloved darling 
without whom life would not be 
worth living even in this beautiful 
body, I know you are you. But 
flatworms don’t matter, coinci- 
dences don’t matter, no mundane 
proof matters. There is no proof 
that some cocksure psychiatrist 
could not explain away as coin- 
cidence, or dejS vu, or self-de- 
lusion. If we let them set the rules, 
we’re lost. But we shan’t. What 



132 



GALAXY 




does matter is that you have me, 
and I have you. Now shut up; I 
want to get them all so easy with 
me that they’ll call me Eunice. 
You say they used to kiss you?) 

(Oh, sure. Friendly kisses. Well, 
Dabrowski used to put zing in it 
but you know how Poles are.) 
(I’m afriad I don’t.) (Put it this 
way. Boss. With a Pole, don’t ad- 
vertise unless you mean to deliver 
— because his intentions are as 
honest as a loaded gun. With Da- 
browski I was very careful not to 
let it go critical.) 

(I’ll remember. Just as well he 
isn’t here. Because the situation is 
like that with Jake, only milder. 
Little baggage, you caused all my 
mobile guards to fall in love with 
you. So now I’ve got to get them 
to accept that you are dead while 
feeling that you are still alive, 
equally. If they call me ‘Eunice’ 
I’m halfway there. If they kiss 
me — ) (WhaP. Boss! Don’t try it!) 

(Now see here, Eunice! If you 
hadn’t played ‘My Last Duchess’ 
to half the county, I wouldn’t be 
having to repair the damage.) 
(‘Damage,’ huh? You’re complain- 
ing!) 

(No, no, my darling! Never. I 
was the prime beneficiary of your 
benevolence. But to lose some- 
thing of value is a damage, and 
that is the damage I must repair.) 
(Well ... I won’t argue, dearest. 
But in this case you can let it be; 
I never let it warm up that much.) 
(And I say you don’t know what 
you are talking about. Cool you 
may have meant to keep it. Un- 
sexy — or as unsexy as you could 
manage which isn’t very. But all 
four of my mobiles were willing 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



to die for you — correct?) (Uh — ) 
(Let’s have no silly talk. Do you 
think the fact that I paid them had 
anything to do with their willing- 
ness? Careful how you answer.) 

(Uh ... I don’t have to answer! 
Boss, what’s the use of stirring 
them up over my death?) (Because, 
my darling, from now on they will 
be guarding me — as I now am, in- 
side your lovely body — ^just as 
they guarded you. They’ve got to 
want to guard me, or they’ll never 
be happy in this weird situation. 
It’s either that, or fire them or re- 
tire them — ) (Oh, no!) (Of course 
not. To paraphrase Sherlock 
Holmes; when you have eliminated 
what you can’t do, what remains 
is what you must do. Besides, 
dearest and only, this is stern prac- 
tice for the much harder case we 
still face.) (Jake? But Jake is — ) 
(Little stupid! Jake has already 
accepted the impossible. I mean 
Joe.) 

(But Boss! You must never see 
Joe.) 

(God knows I wish I could avoid 
it. Never mind, beloved; we won’t 
see him until you know — as I do — 
that we must. Now either shut up, 
or coach me in how to handle these 
brave men.) 

(Well . I’ll help all I can. But 
you’ll never get them as easy as 
they were with me — ‘kissing 
friends’ easy, I mean. I was an 
employee. You are the Boss.) 

(If that argument were valid, 
queens would never get pregnant. 
Sure it makes it harder. But 
you’ve given me a lot to work 
with. Want to bet?) 

(Oh, sure. I’ll bet you a billion 
dollars you can’t kiss even one of 

133 




them. Don’t be silly, Boss; we can 
never make a real bet, there is no 
way to pay off.) (You don’t have 
much practice being an angel, do 
you, little imp? You still think in 
earthy terms. Certainly we can 
make a bet and pay off to the win- 
ner. This baby in us — ) (Huh! Now 
wait a moment — ) {You wait a 
moment, Eunice. If I win this bet, 
/ name our baby. If I lose, you 
have the privilege. Fair bet?) 

(Oh. All right, it’s a bet. But 
you’ll lose.) 

(We’ll see.) 

(Oh, yes, you will. Boss. You’ll 
lose even if you win. Want to know 
why?) (Planning on cheating?) 
(Not necessary. Boss darling; 
you’re going to find that you want 
to name the baby whatever name 
I want it to have. Because you’re 
a sucker for a pretty girl. Boss, al- 
ways have been and still are.) (Now 
wait a moment. I used to be, but 
now I am that ‘pretty girl’ and — ) 
(You’ll find out. Do you want 
coaching? I’ll help you win if it 
can be done. It can’t.) (Yes, but 
tuck your advice in edgeways; I’ve 
been chewing this bone too long.) 
“Fred, I’ll trade you one of these 
Danish sandwiches for more wine. 
Then keep our glasses filled; Shor- 
ty doesn’t drink and Tom won’t 
and I want company in getting 
tiddly, this is my freedom celebra- 
tion.” 

(Fred might be easiest if you can 
get him over seeing ghosts when 
he looks at you.) “I don’t mind 
another glass. Miss, but I mustn’t 
get tiddly. I’m on duty.” 

“Pish and tush. Tom and Shorty 
will get us home even if they have 
to drag us. Right, Shorty?” (Shor- 

134 



ty is your impossible case. I man- 
aged it only by being ‘little girl’ to 
him — which you can’t be. Boss.) 

“We’ll certainly try. Miss 
Smith.” 



1 have to be Miss Smith on 
”a picnic? You called Mrs. 
Branca Eunice, did you not? Did 
she call you Shorty?” 

“Miss, she called me by my 
name. Hugo.” 

“Do you prefer that to your 
nickname?” 

“It’s the name my mother gave 
me. Miss.” 

“That answers me, Hugo; I will 
remember. But it brings to mind a 
problem. Anybody want to fight 
me for the last black olive? Come 
on, put up your dukes. But that’s 
not the problem. I said I didn’t 
want to be called Miss Smith un- 
der these circumstances. But I 
don’t want to be called Johann 
either; that’s a man’s name. Hugo, 
you have christened babies?” 
“Many times. Miss — uh — ” 

Joan cut in fast. “That’s right, 
you don’t know what to call me. 
Hugo, having named so many 
babies you must have opinions 
about names. Do you think ‘Joan’ 
pronounced as two syllables would 
be a good name for a girl who 
used to be a man named Johann?” 
“Yes. I do.” 

“Tom? What do you think?” 
(Tom would kiss you at the drop 
of a hint if you weren’t his em- 
ployer. I don’t think he ever did 
give up hoping to catch me alone 
... so I was as careful not to let 
that chance come up as I was with 
Dabrowski. All it took with Tom 



GALAXY 




was to say, ‘Tom, if you’re going 
to be stuffy about letting me pay 
for extra service — ’ it was an after 
midnight run. Boss; a rare-blood 
call — ‘at least you can kiss me 
goodnight.’ So he did, quite well. 
After which Hugo was too polite 
not to lean way down and give me 
a fatherly little peck. But what 
worked for Eunice can’t work for 
Miss Smith.) (So watch me switch 
decks on them, young ’un.) 

“It sounds like a good name to 
me,” the driver-guard agreed. 

“Fred? Do I look like ‘Joan’ to 
you?” She sat up straight and lifted 
her chest. (You look like you’re 
going to break that bandeau, if 
you aren’t careful.) (Pfui, little 
hussy; it can’t break. I want him 
to realize that I’m female.) (He 
realizes it. Winnie ought to be here 
to take his pulse.) 

“I don’t see why anybody should 
get a vote but you. But, sure, I 
like it.” 

“Good! I still have to sign pa- 
pers with my former name — but 
I’m ‘Joan’ in my mind. But, 
friends, this country must have a 
thousand Joan Smiths in it; I need 
a middle name. But I want one for 
a much better reason.” She looked 
with solemn seriousness at the 
giant black. “Hugo, you are a 
man of God. Would it be pre- 
sumptuous of me to call myself 
. Joan Eunice?” (Boss, if you 
make my friend Hugo cry I’ll — 
I’ll — I won’t speak to you the rest 
of the day!) (Oh, quit nagging! 
Hugo won’t cry. He’s the only 
one of the three who believes 
you’re here. He has faith.) 

“I think that would be beauti- 
ful,” Reverend Hugo White an- 



swered solemnly and sniffed back 
tears. 

“Hugo, Eunice would not want 
you to be sad about it.” She 
looked away from him, her own 
eyes bright with unshed tears. 
“That settles it. My new name will 
be — is — Joan Eunice. I don’t want 
anyone ever to forget Eunice. 
Most especially I want you, her 
friends, to know this. Now that I 
am a woman, Eunice is my model, 
the ideal I must live up to, every 
hour, every minute, of my new 
life. Will you help me? Will you 
treat me as Eunice? Yes, yes. I’m 
your employer; somehow I must 
be both, and it’s not easy. But the 
most difficult part for me is to 
learn to behave and think and feel 
as Eunice . when I’ve had so 
many weary years as a cranky, 
self-centered old man. You are her 
friends— will you help me?” (Boss, 
did you ever sell real estate in 
Florida?) (Damn it, if you can’t 
help, keep quietl) (Sorry, Boss. 
That was applause. As Hugo 
would say, ‘You done perfect.’) 

Tom Finchley said quietly, 
“We’ll help. That goes for Da- 
browski, too. By the way, she 
called him Anton. First she called 
him Ski like the rest of us. Then 
she learned his first name and 
called him by it.” 

“Then I will call him Anton. 
Will you all call me Eunice? Or at 
least Joan Eunice? To help me? 
Oh, call me Miss Smith when oth- 
ers are around; I know you won’t 
feel easy otherwise. You probably 
called her Mrs. Branca if other 
people were — ” 

“We did.” 

“So call me Miss Smith when it 

135 



I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 




would be natural for you to call 
her Mrs. Branca. But when you 
called her Eunice, call me Joan 
Eunice and — dear and trusted 
friends! — any time you feel that I 
have earned it, please call me Eu- 
nice. It will be the highest compli- 
ment you can pay me, so don’t use 
it lightly. Leave off the ‘Joan’ and 
call me ‘Eunice.’ Will you?” 

Finchley looked at her, unsmil- 
ing. ‘‘Yes . Eunice.” 

‘‘Tom, I haven’t earned it yet.” 
Finchley did not answer. Fred 
said, ‘‘Let me get this straight. 
‘Joan Eunice’ is for everyday . 
but ‘Eunice’ means we think you’ve 
done and said just what Mrs. Bran- 
ca would have.” 

“That’s right, that’s what I 
said.” 

<<T*HEN I know what Tom 
meant. Uh, this has been a 
touchy day — worse for you. I’d 
say, but not easy for any of us. 
Shorty — Hugo, I mean — said she 
was an angel. Or meant it, any- 
how. I can’t argue; Shorty is a 
preacher and knows more about 
angels and suchlike than 1 do. But 
if she was — is, I mean — still, she 
had a lot of salt and pepper in her, 
too. You remember an hour back 
when you snapped at Shorty and 
yelled for Tom?” 

She sighed. “Yes, I remember. I 
lost my temper. I’ve got a long 
way to go. I know it.” 

“But that’s just what I’m saying 
. Eunice. She had a lot of spunk. 
If we had tried to make her eat by 
herself, she would have kicked the 
gong. Right, Shorty? — I mean 
Hugo?” 

“Amen! Eunice.” 

136 



Finchley said, “Fred read my 
mind close enough . Eunice. But 
I was thinking of other things, too. 
I never thought of her as an angel, 
partic’larly. She just treated us 
like people.” 

“Tom—” 

“Yeah, Shorty? Hugo.” 

“My name’s Shorty to you — 
and to you, Fred. Don’t put on 
any fancies. Hugo was Mama’s 
name for me. And hers. Yours, 
Eunice. But I near forgot what I 
had to say. Tom, that’s all any- 
body wants. To be treated ‘like 
people.’ She done it that way — 
Eunice. And now you do, too. 
‘Like people.’ Mr. Smith didn’t 
quite manage it. But he was old 
and sick and we made allowances.” 
“Oh, dear! I feel like crying 
again. Hugo — when I was Mr. 
Smith, I never meant to be any- 
thing but people. Truly I didn’t.” 
“Sick people can’t help being 
cranky. My Daddy got so mean 
before he passed on, I run away 
from home. Worst mistake I ever 
made. But I don’t fault him for it. 
We do what we do, then we live 
with it. Eunice — the first Eunice — 
is an angel now, my heart tells me 
and my head knows. But she had 
her little human ways, same as 
everybody. The dear Lord don’t 
fault us for that.” 

“Hugo? If it had been me and 
not her, would I have made it? To 
Heaven?” (Om Mani Padme Hum! 
Watch it. Boss! He’ll drag you 
over to that creek and wash your 
sins away.) (If he wants to. I’ll let 
him. Shut up!) 

“I don’t rightly know,” the 
preacher said softly. “I never knew 
Mr. Smith that well. But the Lord

do move in mysterious ways. 
Looks like He give you a second 
chance. He always knows what 
He’s doing.” (Oh, all right, twin. 
Try not to get water up our nose.) 

“Thank you, Hugo. I think He 
did, too — and I’m trying to justify 
it.” She sighed. “But it’s not easy. 
I try to do what Eunice would do. 
At least justify the second chance 
she gave me. I think I know what 
she would do now. But I’m not 
certain.” (I’d knock off all this 
talk, that’s what I’d do.) (Pipe 
down and give me a chance.) She 
looked around. “I don’t know how 
well you knew her and I keep 
learning things about her. I think 
you three — you four; I include An- 
ton — must have been her closest 
friends, at least in my household. 
Certainly you knew her better than 
I had thought. Tom?” 

“Yes, Eunice?” 

“Did you ever kiss her?” 

Her driver looked startled. “Yes 
. Joan Eunice.” 

“Meaning Eunice would never 
ask such a question; she would 
just do what her heart told her to. 
I wanted to, Tom — but I was 
scared. Not yet used to being a 
girl.” She jumped up, stood by his 
chair, took his hands, pulled. 

Slowly he got to his feet. She 
put her arms around his shoulders, 
put up her face — waited. 

He sighed and almost scowled, 
then took her in his arms and 
kissed her. (Twin, he can do tots 
better.) (He will. The poor dear is 
scared.) Joan let him go without 
forcing it beyond his willingness, 
whispered, “Thank you, Tom,” 
and quickly left his arms. 

— went on to Fred, took his 



hands. Again Fred looked fright- 
ened but he got up promptly. 
(What about Fred, Eunice? Sexy 
or sisterly?) (Too late, twin!) Fred 
embraced her with unexpected 
force, met her mouth so quickly 
than Joan was caught with her lips 
open and he at once answered it, 
savagely. 

But briefly. He broke from it 
and both were trembling. (Eunice! 
What is this? You didn’t warn me.) 
(So I goofed. Later, dear. Slow 
march now and say three Money 
Hums and be darn sure to be an 
innocent child with Father Hugo.) 

Joan went slowly around the ta- 
ble the long way, stopped by Hugo, 
waited. He got up from his chair, 
looked down at her. She moved 
closer, put her hands on his chest, 
looked up, face solemn, lips 
closed, eyes open. 

Gently he put his arms around 
her. (My God, Eunice, if he really 
hugged us, he ’ud break us in two!) 
(He never will, twin; he’s the gen- 
tlest man alive.) 

Hugo’s lips met hers in soft 
benediction, unhurried but quickly 
over. She stayed in his arms a mo- 
ment. “Hugo?' When you pray for 
her tonight, will you add a prayer 
for me? I may not deserve it. But 
I need it.” 

“I will, Eunice.” He seated her 
with gallant grace, then sat down 
again. (High, low, jack, and game, 
twin — what are you going to name 
him?) (‘Eunice,’ of course!) (Even 
if he’s a boy?) (If he’s a boy, he’ll 
be named Jacob E. — for ‘Eunice’ 
— Smith.) (‘Johann E. Smith’ is 
better.) (I won the bet, so shut up. 
I won’t wish ‘Johann’ on a boy. 
Now what’s this about Fred?) (You 



I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



137 





won’t believe it.) (By now I believe 
anything. All right, later.) “Fred, 
is there any wine in that bottle? 
Hugo, will you open the second 
bottle? I need it. I’m shaky.” 
“Certainly, Eunice. Hand me 
the bottle, Fred.” 

“I’m going to eat some more, 
too, and I hope all of you will. 
Tom, am I still Eunice? Or am I a 
hussy who doesn’t understand how 
a lady behaves?” 

“Yes, Eunice. I mean No, Eu- 
nice. I— Oh, hell!” 

S HE patted his hand. “That’s the 
nicest compliment I’ve had yet, 
Tom. You would never have said 



‘Oh, hell’ to Miss Smith . but 
you know that Eunice — Joan Eu- 
nice — is human.” She looked 
around the table. “Do you know 
how good it is to be touched? Have 
you ever watched kittens snug- 
gling? For over a quarter of a cen- 
tury no one kissed me. Except for 
an occasional handshake I don’t 
think anyone ever touched me. Un- 
til nurses and doctors started han- 
dling me. Friends — dear friends — 
you have taken me back into the 
human race, with your lips. I am 
so very grateful to Eunice — to Eu- 
nice Branca — that she kissed you 
before I did, and won your friend- 
ship — your love? I think so. For it 



meant that you let me in — treated 
me as ‘people!’ Uh, tell me this, I 
must know — even if it makes you, 
Tom, call me Joan Eunice again. 
Did Eunice kiss Anton, too?” 
(Boss, I’m not going to tell you 
anything until we’re alone!) (Didn’t 
asic you, dear.) 

“Won’t anyone tell me? Well, I 
suppose it’s an unfair question.” 

Finchley said suddenly, “Teams 
shift around. I drive with Fred, and 
Shorty with Ski, and so forth. 
Been times when I rode Shotgun 
for Ski. Eunice, she treated us all 
alike. But don’t never think any- 
thing bad about it — ” 

“I don’t!” 



“ — because there wasn’t any 
such. She was so warm and friend- 
ly — and good — that she could kiss 
a man friend just for, uh — ” 

“For Idvingkindness,” Shorty 
supplied. 

“ ‘For lovingkindness.’ Kissed 
us thank you and good night as 
quick with her husband there as 
any other time. Always did, if we 
stopped for a late bite o’ supper 
with them.” (All right, twin. Fred 
and Anton. Not Tom and Hugo. 
Happened only once. Oh, Tom 
would have, but no chance, so I 
kept it cool. Hugo — nobody gets 
past Hugo’s guard and I never 
tried. He has moral character —

something you and I don’t know 
anything about.) 

“Thank you for telling me, 
Tom. I’ll never let Anton guess. 
But he’ll find me easy to kiss if he 
wishes to . now that I know that 
she shared lovingkindness with him. 
Abrupt change of subject: Tom, is 
that pretty stream polluted?’’ 

“It’s clean. Clean as a creek can 
be, I mean. I know because I found 
out about this place through the 
company lending it to our guild 
for a picnic. Some of us went 
swimming after the farm super 
told us it was okay.” 

“Oh, wonderful! Because I want 
to swim. I last went swimming in 
natural water — old swimming hole 
style, I mean — let me see . 
goodness! More than three-quar- 
ters of a century ago.” 

“Eunice, I don’t think you 
should.” 

“Why?” 

“Because it can be polluted an- 
other way. Dropouts. Not all the 
dropouts are in the A.A.s; any 
wild countryside attracts them. 
Like this. I didn’t make a fuss but 
when you walked down to the bank 
by yourself, Fred had you flanked 
one side and me the other.” 

“Well, heavens, if you can keep 
me safe on the bank, you can keep 
me safe in the water.” 

“It ain’t quite the same, truly it 
ain’t. I was a few seconds late once, 
I won’t be again. Some dropouts 
are real nasty weirdos, not just 
harmless nuts.” 

“Tom, why argue? I want to get 
into that water, feel it all over me. 
I intend to.” 

“I wish you wouldn’t . Joan 
Eunice.” 

140 



She jerked her head around at 
the last two words. Then she 
grinned and pouted her lower lip. 
“Okay, Tom. Darn it. I’ve handed 
you three a leash you can lead me 
by any time you see fit. And yet 
I’m supposed to be boss. Funny.” 
“It’s like the Secret Service,” 
Finchley answered soberly. “The 
President is the top boss of any . 
but he gives in when his guards tell 
him not to do something.” 

“Oh, I wasn’t complaining; I 
was wryly amused. But don’t jerk 
that leash too much, Tom; I don’t 
think Eunice would stand for it 
and neither will I.” 

“I’m hoping you won’t pull on 
the leash as much as she did. If 
she, uh — well, things could ’a’ 
been different.” 

Fred said, “Tom, don’t cry over 
spilt milk.” 

Joan said quickly, “I’m sorry. 
Boys, I think the picnic is over. 
Maybe some day we can all have 
that swim somewhere: safe and just 
as beautiful.” (Eunice, can you 
swim?) (Red Cross lifesaver — you 
knew that, it was in my snoopsheet. 
Never went out for the team, 
though; cheerleader was more fun.) 
(I could make a comment.) (Look 
who’s talking! No-pants Smith.) 
(Who taught me?) (You didn’t 
need teaching; you have the in- 
stincts.) 

XIX 

A SHORT time later they were 
again in the car. Finchley said, 
“Home, Miss Smith?” 

“Tom, I can’t hear you.” 

“I asked did you want to go 
home. Miss?” 



GALAXY 



“I understood that part but this 
intercom must be out of order. I 
heard something that sounded like 
‘Miss Smith.’ ” 

There was a silence. “Eunice, do 
you want to go home?” 

“Not until dinnertime, Tom; I 
want all of this lovely day I can 
have.” 

“Okay, Eunice. Do I cruise? Or 
go somewhere?” 

“Uh ... I have one more item 
on my list, and there’s time enough 
for anything you three may want 
to pick up, too, so check around.” 

“Will do. Where do we take you 
for what you want, Eunice?” 

“I don’t know. I lost touch with 
such matters years ago. Tom, I 
want to buy a present for Mr. Sal- 
omon, something nice but unnec- 
essary — presents should be unnec- 
essary, a luxury a person might 
not buy himself. So it probably 
would be a men’s shop that stocks 
luxurious unnecessaries. Aber- 
crombie & Fitch used to be that 
sort — but I’m not certain they are 
still in business.” 

“They are. But let me ask Fred 
and Shorty.” 

Shortly Finchley reported; 
“There are a dozen places that 
would do. But we think The Twen- 
ty-First Century Stud has the fast- 
est stock.” 

“Roz. Let’s giddyap and get 
there.” 

“That is, if you don’t mind their 
prices. ‘Twigs and leaves.’ ” 

“I don’t mind; I’ve met thieves 
before. Tom — all of you. I came 
out of this operation with more 
money than I had last year . and 
it’s a nuisance. I’ve played the 
money game and I’m bored with it. 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



Any time any of you can think of 
a good way to help me get rid of 
some — a good way, I said; I won’t 
be played for a sucker — you’d be 
doing me a favor to tell me. Hugo, 
are there any poor people in your 
church?” 

His answer was slow. “Lots of 
them, Eunice. 'But not hurlin’ 
poor, just Welfare poor. I’d like to 
think about it . because it don’t 
do a man no good to plain give 
him what he ought to root for. So 
the Book says, in different words.” 
“That’s the trouble, Hugo. I’ve 
given away money many times and 
usually did harm when I meant to 
do good. But the Book also says 
something about the eye of the 
needle. All right, think about it. 
Now let’s go see those thieves. I’ll 
need a man to help me. Which one 
of you dresses the most far-out 
when you aren’t in uniform?” 

She heard Fred laugh. “Eunice, 
it’s no race. You should see the 
getups Tom wears. A Christmas 
tree. A light show.” 

Finchley growled, then said, 
“Don’t listen to him, Eunice.” 
“He’s probably jealous, Tom. 
All right, ,if there is parking inside 
or near this shop, you come help 

yj 

IT 16 . 

As they passed through the sec- 
ond gate Finchley said, “Crash 
belts, Eunice?” 

“I’m wearing the Swedish — and 
it’s comfortable now that Hugo 
has adjusted it. Could we get along 
with just it and the collision net if 
we didn’t go so fast? Or does that 
make me ‘Joan Eunice’ again?” 

“Uh — Will you wear the fore- 
head strap?” 

“All right. It’s just that I don’t 

141 




like to be tied down all over. It re- 
minds me — well, it reminds me of 
the way the doctors kept me 
strapped down after the operation. 
Necessary, but I hated it.” She did 
not mention that a forehead strap 
was what she disliked the most. 

“We heard about that — must ’a’ 
been horrid. But you need the fore- 
head strap. Say I’m doing only a 
hundred, a slam stop could break 
your neck. If you don’t wear it.” 

“So I wear it.” 

“I don’t see the light on the 
board.” 

“Because I haven’t put it on yet. 
There. Did the light go on?” 

“Yes. Thank you . Eunice.” 

«rpHANK you, Tom. For tak- 
ing care of me. Let’s mush. I 
wasn’t pulling on the leash, truly I 
wasn’t.” (Says you. Boss, you’re 
mendacious, untruthful and a fib- 
ber.) (Where did I learn it, dearie? 
They’re sweet boys, Eunice — but 
we’ve got to work out a way to 
live so that we don’t have to clear 
everything with forty other people. 
Good servants are priceless — but 
you work for them as much as 
they work for you. Life should be 
simpler. Honey, how would you 
like to go to India and be a guru 
and sit on a mountain top and nev- 
er have any plans? Just sit and wait 
for your grateful chelas to gather 
around?) 

(Might be a long wait. Why not 
sit at the bottom of the mountain 
and wait for the boys to gather 
around?) (One-track mind!) (Yes. 
Yours, you dirty old man.) (Con- 
ceded. But I try to' act like a lady.) 
(Not too hard, you don’t.) (As 
hard as you ever did, little trollop. 

142 



I was called Joan Eunice once . 
and the issue had nothing to do 
with sex.) (You’d be surprised how 
much sex had to do with it, Joan.) 
(Well . from that point of view, 
yes. But as long as they call me 
Eunice I’ll go on believing that I’ve 
‘done just perfect.’ Honestly, 
though, good servants can be 
smothering. Take Winnie. She’s a 
darling — but she’s underfoot every 
minute. Eunice, how the devil can 
we manage that actively female 
life you want — sorry, we want — 
with so much chaperonage?) 

(Take a tip from Winnie.) 

(Let her in on your plans. Then 
she’ll keep your secrets and never 
ask a question, just as you do for 
her. Try it.) 

(I may have to. I’m sure she 
won’t talk . and will happily lis- 
ten to anything I need to spill. But, 
Eunice, if I go outside the house, 
it’s going to be hard to keep Tom 
and Hugo, or Anton and Fred, 
from guessing. You saw the elab- 
orate maneuver I had to use to- 
day.) 

(You didn’t have to. Boss; they 
won’t talk.) 

(Perhaps they won’t, but I don’t 
want them even to think. They’re 
beginning to think I’m an angel — 
named Eunice — and I’d rather 
keep it that way.) 

(Boss, they know darned well 
that Eunice is no angel. Even Hugo 
knows it . because Hugo is the 
smartest of the four, even if he is 
an illit. Knows people. Under- 
stands them from having been 
there himself. Forgives them their 
transgressions and loves them any- 
how. Boss dear, they loved me the 

GALAXY 




way I was, feet of clay and all — 
and they’ll love you the same way.) 

(Maybe. I hope so. I know I 
love you more, knowing more 
about you and things I never sus- 
pected, than I did before we con- 
solidated. Immoral little wench. 
What’s this about you and Fred 
and Anton? Did you really?) 

(Wondered when you’d get 
around to that. Those good-night 
kisses did start out just friendly. 
Brotherly. Fatherly in Hugo’s case. 
Never got past that with Tom, as 
we were always either under Hu- 
go’s eye, or Jake’s, or both — I just 
knew darn well a man was kissing 
me. But Fred and Anton weren’t 
much chaperonage for each other 
and they were both charged up 
over me. So, when a chance turned 
up, I thought, ‘Why not?’) 

(Pure charity, eh?) 

(Was that sarcasm. Boss? Any- 
how, they took me home late one 
night. Not a blood donation call, 
just working late with Jake when 
we were very rushed getting things 
arranged for you. The ‘warm body’ 
project. I invited them in for a 
coke and a snack, as usual. Only 
it turned out Joe wasn’t home.) 

(So human nature won — again.) 

(You seem to have a low opin- 
ion of human nature. Boss dar- 
ling.) 

(I have a high opinion of human 
nature. I think it will prevail in 
spite of all efforts of wowsers to 
suppress it. But that’s all it took? 
Two men? Cold sober? And a 
chance that your husband might 
walk in? Lovely fallen angel, your 
story not only has holes; it is in- 
consistent. I do know something 
about men, having been one. What 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



they’ll risk, what they won’t. Plen- 
ty, that is, for a woman. But two 
men tend to be wary of each other 
and still more so when a husband 
might show up. Darling, you’ve 
left out something — this does not 
sound like a first time.) 

(Boss, cross our heart, it was a 
first time . and the only time, 
for I was kilted soon after. All 
right. I’ll fill in the holes. Joe I 
wasn’t likely to walk in and they 
knew it. Couldn’t, as our door 
was hand-bolted from the inside 
whenever either of us was there. 

Joe was even more careful about 
it than I was, as he had always 
been a city boy. But they knew 
also that Joe was not due home 
until midnight . and they 
brought me home about twenty- 
one-thirty. No hurry, no worry, 
no flurry. While Joe can’t read, he 
can tell time — you know those lit- 
tle dummy clocks some one-man 
shops use? Back at such-and-such ! 
a time, and mark the time by set- 
ting the hands? j 

(We had one of those, to tell the 
other one when he would be back. 
That night the door opened to my j 
voice, so I looked for the dummy i 
clock and found it set for midnight 
— and told Anton and Fred that I 
was sorry but Joe wasn’t going to 
be home soon enough for a visit.) 

(Called attention to it, minx. ! 
Sounds like a setup.) ! 

(Well, 1 knew what I was ready j 
for, once I knew we had the place j 
to ourselves. Oh, shucks. Boss, 

I’m still trying to be your ‘nice 
girl.’ I had had my ear cocked for 
a late arrival with that team for 
over a month. When Jake asked 
me to work after dinner, 1 phoned 

143 



Joe, just as usual. And set it up 
under Jake’s nose. Short-talked it 
— almost another language if 
spoken by a husband and wife. 
What Jake heard was me telling 
Joe that I wouldn’t be home until 
twenty-one-thirty. What Jake 
didn’t hear, or would not under- 
stand, was that I was asking Joe if 
he minded being elsewhere, in fam- 
ily short-talk code we used if we 
wanted that favor. It was all right. 
Boss, darling; I made myself 
scarce for Joe’s sake oftener than 
I asked it of him. The only ques- 
tion was: Was he painting? Turned 
out he was not, so I was home 
free. 

(Joe asked if I wanted him to be 
away all night? What he said was: 
‘Roz. Punch or phone?’ Not that 
Joe ever punched me to wake me, 
but I answered, ‘Judy,’ meaning 
that it was up to him but I hoped 
he would punch me, and added, 
‘Blackbirds,’ and gave him a phone 
kiss and signed off. All set, no 
sweat — knew what I would find at 
home.) 

(‘Blackbirds?’) 

(‘Four and twenty blackbirds, 
baked in a pie — ’ set midnight on 
the clock even if you stay out all 
night, Joe darling. Oh, it could 
have been ‘pumpkin’ or ‘Christmas 
Eve’ or ‘Reach’ or ‘solid gold.’ 
But what I used was ‘Blackbirds.’) 

(Did you kids ever talk Eng- 
lish?) 

(Of course we did. Boss. Joe 
speaks good English when he needs 
to. But short-talk settled it in a 
dozen words. Without giving Jake 
any hint that I was late-dating 
him. If I had had Betsy at hand I 
would have used hush and spoken 



standard English. But we weren’t 
at your house. Boss; we were at 
Jake’s pad in Safe Harbor. You 
see, we weren’t actually working 
late, not that late. I was using the 
phone you used yesterday, with 
Jake only feet away from me. Had 
to be short-talk.) 

(Let me get this straight. Joe set 
the dummy clock, saying he would 
not be home until midnight. Did 
he come home then?) 

(About ten minutes after mid- 
night. Joe wouldn’t embarrass a 
guest by being too prompt. Joe is 
a natural gentleman, never had to 
learn; he just is. It was the first 
thing that attracted me to him, 
and the quality that caused me to 
ask him to marry me. An illit, 
certainly — but I’ll take an illit 
gentleman over an Ivy-League 
squeak any year.) 

(I agree, beloved. The more 1 
hear about Mr. Jose Branca the 
better I like him. And respect him. 
And regret his tragic loss — mean- 
ing you, beloved little strumpet. I 
was just trying to get the schedule 
straight for what must have been a 
busy night. Okay, Joe got home 
shortly after midnight. But early 
that evening you phoned him and 
set things up for this date with An- 
ton and Fred. Then you got back 
into bed with Jake — ) 

(Oh, dear! Boss, I’ve shocked 
you again.) 

(No, my darling. Surprised, not 
shocLed. I find your memoirs fas- 
cinating.) 

(Shocked. That schedule sounds 
like a whore on pay day. But it 
wasn’t that at all. Boss. It was love 
— love and respect for Jake, love 
and affection for Anton and Fred, 



144 



GALAXY 




love and devotion and understand- 
ing and mutual trust and respect 
with Joe. If my husband didn’t dis- 
approve, what right have you — or 
anybody! — to look down your 
nose at me?) 

(Darling, darling! I was not 
shocked, I have never been shocked 
by you. Damn it, it’s that genera- 
tion gap. You can’t believe that I 
packed far more offbeat behavior 
into my long years of lechery than 
you possibly could have crowded 
into the fourteen years you claim. 
You’ve been a busy body, that’s 
clear — but I had more than five 
times as many years at it and quite 
as much enthusiasm. Probably not 
as frequent opportunities, but 
beautiful girls get asked oftener 
than do homely boys. But it was 
never for lack of trying on my 
part, nor do I have any complaints, 
as I received more cooperation 
than I had any reason to expect.) 

(I think you were shocked.) 

(No, little innocent. Sheer ad- 
miration — plus surprise at your 
endurance. You must have been 
half dead the next day.) 

(On the contrary I felt grand. 
Glowing. Happy. You remarked 
on it. You may even recall it . 
it was the day Joe painted me with 
tiger stripes and a cat’s face make- 
up.) 

(Be darned if I don’t! You were 
bouncy as a kitten — and 1 said you 
looked like the cat who ate the 
canary. Darling girl, I was hurting 
that day; you cheered me up.) 

(I’m glad.) 

(How much sleep did you get?) 

(Oh, plenty. Six hours. Five at 
least. Plus a nap stretched out on 
my tummy while Joe did most of 

I WILLFEAR NO EVIL 



the stripes. Joan, a well-loved 
woman doesn’t need as much sleep 
as a lonely one — you’ll find out. 
As for it being too much for me — 
Boss, who told me just last week 
that nothing encourages sex the 
way sex does? You, that’s who.) 

(Yes. But I was speaking from a 
man’s viewpoint — ) 

(Works the same for a woman, 
twin. You’ll see.) 

(I hope so. I know that most 
people — in my day — assumed the 
opposite. But it’s not true. Sex, 
whatever else it is — much else! — 
is an athletic skill. The more you 
practice, the more you can, the 
more you want to, the more you 
enjoy it, the less it tires you. I’m 
glad to hear — very personally glad 
— that it works that way for a 
woman, too. But you aren’t the 
first girl to tell me so. Uh . first 
time I heard a girl say that, or 
roughly that, was when Harding 
was President. Not a girl, a very 
sweet young married woman who 
had more in common with you 
than you are likely to believe. Al- 
most certainly dead now, God rest 
her soul; she would be over a hun- 
dred years old.) 

(What was her name?) 

(Does it matter? Little busy- 
body, you were telling me about 
Fred and Anton. I still don’t un- 
derstand how you swung it. The 
setup, yes — but how did you gen- 
tle them to it? Did you split the 
time and take them into your 
apartment separately?) 

(Oh, heavens, no! That would be 
rude. And embarrassing for every- 
one. It would have turned me off 
utterly. It was a Troy.) 

(Well?) 



145 




(Boss, can you imagine how ex- 
cited two men can get while kiss- 
ing — fondling — the same girl? If 
she’s willing? If they trust each 
other? Which they did, they were 
driver and shotgun together.) 

(Yes, that’s true but I can’t vis- 
ualize — wups! I just remembered 
something that happened so many 
years ago I had almost forgotten 
it.) 

(Tell me.) 

(No, no, you go on. Just that 
history repeats itself — as it always 
does. Go on.) 

(Well, they do. Boss. Excite 
each other even if they don’t touch 
each other at all. Just her. ‘Heter- 
odyning’ is the term I learned for 
it in secretronics; I don’t know 
what the kinseys call it. But I had 
been kissing them good night al- 
most every other night for weeks, 
and kissing them when they picked 
me up in the mornings. And the 
kisses got warmer and it’s never 
been my nature to discourage a 
man if I liked him — which I did; I 
felt affectionate toward both of 
them; they’re nice people. 

(Presently we were stopping for 
a necking session — could no longer 
call it a good night kiss — in the 
basement parking before they 
would take me up the lift. I had to 
slow that down by saying, ‘Watch 
it, boys. You’re not only getting 
body paint on your uniforms, 
you’re getting me so mussed up 
I’ll have trouble getting neat 
enough that Joe won’t notice it.’ 
Which did slow them down, more 
on my account than any fret about 
uniforms; they liked Joe — every- 
body likes Joe — and did not want 
to cause me worry at home. Didn’t 

146 



tell them that Joe wasn’t fooled; 
his artist’s eyes sees much more 
than most people see. 

(But we settled it that night. 
Boss. I told them that I was not a 
tease and that I was as eager as 
they were . but that I was not 
going to be spread in a basement. 
But that I would find a chance. 
They are both nice boys — oh, 
men, sure; Anton is forty and Fred 
is as old as I am. Was. So they 
waited and didn’t do more than 
kiss me and grab a friendly feel. 
Then twice we almost had it made 
but Joe was busy painting, which I 
would not interrupt to take the 
President to bed. 

(Then we hit the jackpot. Al- 
most missed at the last minute; 
Jake was going to send me home 
in his car. He told me to cancel the 
call I had put in for my car. Yours, 
I mean. I surprised Jake by being 
balky — told hint that I didn’t feel 
safe with Charlie unless he, Jake, 
was along. True, as far as it went; 
Charlie is a bad one, not like our 
four. 

(So dear old Jake was going to 
get dressed and ride with me — I 
said that was silly, that Finchley 
and Shorty — I never referred to 
them as Tom and Hugo and 
wouldn’t advise you to — ) 

(I’m not stupid, dearest. When 
I’m Miss Smith, they are Finchley 
and Shorty.) 

(Sorry, Boss darling, I know 
you’re not stupid. But 1 have more 
experience in being a woman than 
you have.) 

(So you have, and you keep me 
straight, darling. But what’s this 
about Tom and Hugo?) 

(Misdirection. I knew who was 

GALAXY 




on call that night. So Fred and An- 
ton picked me up and I was tempt- 
ed to tell them — getting more ex- 
cited all the time, myself. 
Couldn’t. Would have spoiled it 
some for them, since men enjoy 
much spreading a married woman 
without her husband knowing it — 
even sweet old Jake relished me 
more for that naughty reason. I 
always went along with this quirk 
because it gave me more control 
over a situation not easy to con- 
trol once a man has had you. 
Gives you a lever. You might re- 
member that, Joan.) 

(I will. But I’ll need a husband 
to make use of it.) 

(You’ll get us a husband, never 
fear, dear — I still think we ought 
to marry Jake. He’ll come around. 
But don’t hold out on him, Joan; 
Jake is not a man you can pressure 
that way.) 

(Eunice, I won’t hold out on 
Jake one-half second. I’ve never 
had any respect for that female 
tactic and won’t use it now that I 
am female.) 

(I have never used it. Boss. I’ve 
used almost every other female 
deception — but not that one. That 
one is whoring but not honest 
whoring. ’Minds me. How do you 
feel about whores. Boss?) 

(Me? Why, the way I feel about 
any professional who performs a 
personal service. Say a dentist, or 
a lawyer, or a nurse. If he’s honest 
I respect him. If he is competent 
as well, my respect is limited only 
by his degree of competence. 
Why?) 

(Have you ever patronized 
whores? Hired their services, I 
mean?) 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



(If I give that a simple affirma- 
tive will you get on with your 
story? We’re already downtown, 
damn it.) 

(Yes, sir. 1 mean, ‘Yes, twin sis- 
ter you knocked-up virgin.’ Got 
home, went up the lift with them, 
was ‘surprised’ to find Joe not at 
home, found the dummy clock 
propped on the sink, hands set at 
midnight and told them what it 
meant. That did it. Finis.) 

{Hey') 

(What is there to tell? You al- 
ready know what we did.) 

Joan sighed. (That is the skimp- 
iest account of a gang bang 1 ever 
heard in my long and evil life.) 

{WhaP. But it wasn’t a gang 
bang. Boss! Quit dragging your 
feet and come on into this century. 
A Troy is not a gang bang. Nor is 
it a frimp session — or needn’t be — 
and this was not. A Troy is friend- 
ly and loving. They are both mar- 
ried and they treated me as sweet- 
ly as they would treat their wives — 
and I loved the way they treated 
me and I loved both of them quite 
a lot — and still do — long before 
the evening was over . when up 
to then it had been just affection- 
ate, sex-charged friendship. Boss, 
one of the regrets I have about be- 
ing killed is that I was never able 
to offer them the second chance 
at me they had earned — and I had 
promised. Mmm ... do you think 
you might make it up to them?) 

(Huh? As you pointed out. I’m 
their boss; it wouldn’t be easy. And 
besides . well, hell. I’m scared. 
Two men?) 

(You didn’t seem scared of Mac 
and Alec.) 

(Not quite the same thing.) 



147 




(Nothing ever is, Boss — especial- 
ly about sex. But I want to tell 
you this. A Troy — if it works 
right, and it can’t unless there is 
trust and respect all the way 
around — if it works, it is the nicest 
thing that can happen to a woman. 
Not just twice as nice because she 
gets twice as much of what she 
wants so badly. That’s not it; she 
might even get less than some rut- 
ty young stud could manage alone. 
It’s the warm and friendly and lov- 
ing and trusting aspect that makes 
it so good. Four times better, at 
least. Maybe eight. Oh, arithmetic 
can’t measure it. But, Joan darling 
— listen to me — until you have 
been in bed between two sweet and 
loving men, men who love each 
other almost as much or even 
more than they love you . with 
your head pillowed on both their 
arms and surrounded by their love 
— until that’s happened to you, 
you still have one virginity to go, 
and an important one. Darling, I 
was crying most of the time they 
were with me . cried again when 
I kissed them good night . was 
still crying happy after they left 
. then jumped out of bed and 
rushed to unbolt the door when Joe 
got home a few minutes later — 
and blubbered all over him and 
took him straight to bed and told 
him all about it while he was being 
especially sweet to me.) 

(Did he want to hear about it?) 

(Wouldn’t yoM want to?) 

(Yes but no two men are alike 
and some husbands get headaches 
from horns.) 

(Some do. Maybe most of them, 
Joan. I was always careful of Joe’s 
feelings. Sometimes I strayed and 



carefully kept it from him — I nev- 
er told him about Jake.) 

(Why not? I would think that 
Joe would approve of Jake for you 
if he approved of anyone. Jake re- 
spects Joe very highly — you know 
it, too; you heard him.) 

(Yes. But Jake is rich and Joe 
is dirt poor. Perhaps Joe could 
have accepted Jake — I now think 
he could have. But I wasn’t sure, 
so 1 didn’t risk hurting him. But 
Anton and Fred — well, they are 
just mobile guards; Joe treated 
them as friends and equals, and 
secretly — I think — felt a little su- 
perior to them, since he is an ar- 
tist and they are just stiffs. I knew 
they wouldn’t trouble Joe’s mind 
. and I was right; he was de- 
lighted for me. Happy that I was 
happy. Can’t explain it, Joan; you 
get an instinct for it. But a man’s 
pride is a fragile thing and it is all 
the armor he has; they are far 
more vulnerable than we are. You 
have to be oh so careful in hand- 
ling them. Or they droop.) 

(I know, Eunice. Literally droop 
in some cases. Did I tell you that 
my second wife made me psychi- 
cally impotent for almost a year?) 

(Oh, you poor darling!) 

(Got over it. Not through a 
shrink. Through the warm and gen- 
erous help of a lady who didn’t as- 
sume that it was my fault. And I 
never troubled again until I was 
too feeble for any sort of proper 
physical functioning.) 

(I’m glad you found her; I wish 
I could thank her. Joan ... I 
wasn’t born knowing this about 
men; I found out the hard way. 
Twin, I made some bad mistakes 
in high school. Look — males are

so much bigger and more muscu- 
lar than we are, I didn’t dream that 
they could be so fragile. Until I 
hurt one boy’s pride so badly he 
dropped out of school . and I’ve 
tried never to hurt any boy, or 
man, since. I was stupid. Boss.) 

(Eunice, how long has it been 
since I last told you I love you?) 
(Oh, at least twenty minutes.) 
(Too long. I love you.) 

Finchley’s voice interrupted her 
revery. “We’re about to park. 
Miss Eunice.” 

“What’s this ‘Miss Eunice’ non- 
sense? We’re not in public.” 
“Seemed like a good compro- 
mise.” 

“It does, huh? Why just dabble 
your toes? Why not go whole hawg 
and call me Miss Smith? — and I 
won’t kiss you good night.” 

“Very well — Miss.” 

“Oh, Tom, don’t tease me. It’s 
been a perfect day; don’t remind 
me that I must be Miss Smith 
again. You know I’ll kiss you 
good night if you’ll let me ... or 
the real Eunice wouldn’t speak to 
me. Hugo, make him behave!” 

“I’ll fix his clock, Eunice. Tom, 
you call her Eunice, real nice.” 

“I’m sorry, Eunice.” 

“That makes me feel better, 
Tom. Are you going to be able to 
park this wagon close enough that 
you can come with me?” 

“Sure thing, Eunice — but keep 
quiet right now, please; I’ve got to 
work close with the traffic com- 
puter to get us in.”

evening. Chief.” Joan 
Wrested her hand on O’Neil’s 
forearm, stepped lightly down. 

“Good evening. Miss. Message 
from Mr. Salomon. His respects 
to you and regrets he will not be 
back for dinner. Twenty-one 
o’clock, he hopes.” 

“Tm sorry to hear it. Then I 
shan’t dine downstairs; please tell 
Cunningham or Della that I want 
trays in my lounge for Winnie and 
me. No service.” 

“Two trays and no service. Miss 
—right.” 

“And tell Dabrowski that I want 
him to drive me tomorrow.” 

“He’s gone home. Miss. But he 
knows he has the duty. He’ll be 
ready.” 

“Perhaps you didn’t understand 
what I said. Chief. I want to tell 
him, now, that / want him to drive 
me tomorrow. Ten, possibly — not 
earlier. So after you phone the 
pantry, call Dabrowski and give 
him that message from me. Leave 
the call in until you reach him. 
And phone me at once when Mr. 
Salomon’s car returns, no matter 
what hour. Don’t consult him; do 
it. Before Rockford unbuttons.” 
“Yes, Miss. Phone the pantry. 
Phone Dabrowski immediately 
thereafter. Phone you instantly 
when Mr. Salomon’s car returns, 
before he is out of his car. If I may 
say so. Miss, it feels good to have 
your firm hand back at the con- 
trols.” 

“You may say so, to me. But 
not to Mr. Salomon. For his firm 
hand has been invaluable. As you 
and I know.”

“As we both know. He’s a fine 
gentleman, Miss; I respect him. 
Shall I tell Cunningham to send 
down for your packages?” 

“No, Finchley and his guns can 
handle them — though I did go on 
quite a shopping spree.” Joan gave 
her security boss Eunice’s best 
happy-little-girl grin. “I was drunk 
with excitement, bad as a kid on 
Christmas, and tried to buy out 
the town. Finchley. Split those 
packages three ways and you three 
come up with me. Yes, I know it’s 
not your work, so don’t report me 
to your guild.” 

Packages, three men, and one 
woman almost filled the front lift. 
Joan waited until Finchley had 
punched for her floor and the lift 
had started, then she quickly 
punched the “Stop” touchplate, 
held them between floors. “Put 
those packages down.” 

She went first to Shorty, took 
his face between her hands. “Thank 
you, Hugo. Thank you most of all, 
for your gentle wisdom got us all 
straightened out.” She pulled his 
face down, kissed him softly and 
unhurriedly, lips closed. “Good 
night.” 

She turned to Fred. “Thank 
you, Fred. I thank you— and Eu- 
nice thanks you.” As his arms 
closed she let her lips come open. 
(See what I mean, twin? That’s a 
sample.) "(I see — I shall be very 
careful not to get him alone unless 
I expect more than a sample.) 
“Good night, Fred.” 

“Tom, it’s been the best day of 
my life. I hope you enjoyed it half 
as much as I did. Thank you.” 
Joan went straight into the kiss 
without waiting for Finchley to an- 

150 



swer, her face up, eyes closed — and 
with her back to Shorty in case her 
driver decided to take advantage of 
it. 

— which he did. (Goodness! Eu- 
nice, are you sure you never laid 
him?) (Quite sure, darn it! Are 
you going to?) (I don’t know, I 
don’t know!) 

Breathless she broke from him, 
turning her back to all of them to 
punch again for her floor and try- 
ing to regain her composure. 

The car stopped and she said, 
“Put everything in my bedroom, 
boys. Winnie! Wait till you see!” 

The little redhead had been wait- 
ing at the lift. “Miss Joan! You’ve 
been gone all day!” 

“And why not? Put them any- 
where, on the floor, on the bed. 
Winnie, have you had dinner? 
That’s all, thanks. Good night and 
thank you all.” 

“Good night. Miss Smith.” 

As soon as the door sealed Joan 
hugged her maid, lifting her off her 
feet. “You didn’t answer. Did you 
eat with the staff? Or did you 
wait?” 

“Couldn’t eat. Oh, Joan, I’ve 
been so worried. You ran away 
and didn’t tell anybody where you 
were going. Bad girl — to worry me 
so.” 

“Pooh. 1 had guards with me; 
you knew I was safe.” 

“But guards aren’t nurses. I’m 
supposed to watch you for Dr. 
Garcia.” 

“And pooh all over dear Doc- 
tor, too. Winsome, I’m no longer 
a patient. I’m no longer a ward; 
I’m a free woman and healthy as a 
horse and you can’t mother me 
every minute like a broody hen. 

GALAXY 




All right, we’ve got supper com- 
ing up and they’ll leave it in the 
lounge and we’ll eat when we feel 
like it.” 

“I know, I was backstairs when 
the order came in — so I hurried up 
the service lift and thought I had 
missed you as the indicator was 
stopped. Then it started again.” 

«QOMETHING wrong with that 

Olift, it stalled. But we kept 
punching buttons until the Yehudi 
woke up. Too many gadgets in 
this house.” (Eunice, I thought a 
stalled elevator was as safe as a 
grave. Is there no privacy any- 
where"!) (’Fraid not. Boss honey. 
But I never worried much about 
such things; I just worried about 
hurting people.) (I stand corrected. 
Ever been caught with your legs 
up, hussy?) (Only once when it was 
embarrassing — and that’s all it 
was. It’s nothing to worry about.) 

“Shall I tell maintenance about 
the lift?” 

“No, Finchley will report it. 
Winsome, maintenance is no part 
of your duties; you’re here to gig- 
gle with me and to give me a shoul- 
der to cry on and to cry on mine — 
and to keep dear Doctor from 
fussing.” Joan started undressing. 
“Get your clothes off; we’re go- 
ing to model clothes — I’ve been 
shopping. Boy oh boy, did I shop! 
Gave the economy a shot in the 
arm, I did. Get those duds off — 
have you had your bath, you dirty 
girl? Or are you going to bathe 
with me? Come here and let me 
smell you.” 

“Had a bath when I got up.” 

“You smell all right, I fear me 
I’m well marinated; it’s been a 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



busy day. Okay, we’ll dunk to- 
gether and get stinking good later. 
Before giving dear Jake another 
lesson in how to relax. But now we 
model. Give us a kiss first.” (Eu- 
nice, will that rubber dingus stay 
in place in the tub?) (It’ll stay 
seated anywhere — or I would have 
left a dozen orphans behind me. 
You can even use the fountain— 
and you had better.) 

“Joan, since you were going 
shopping, why didn’t you take me 
along? Meanie.” 

“Complaints, complaints, com- 
plaints. I thought you needed sleep, 
dear. Or didn’t Bob show up?” 
Winifred blushed clear down her 
breasts but she answered happily, 
“Oh, yes, he did! But I would have 
been up at once if you had called 
me — love to shop.” 

“What time did you wake up?” 
The blush renewed. “Not till al- 
most thirteen. Long past noon.” 
“The defense rests. Winsome 
baby, I didn’t take you along be- 
cause I bought things for you, too 
. and if I had had you along, 
you would have fussed every time 
I spent a dollar on you. And to 
set a precedent, too. I’m not a 
prisoner any longer. I’m free to 
come and go just as you are. If I 
don’t take you along, you mustiVt 
ask why and I may not tell you 
where or what.” 

The younger girl looked 
crushed. “Yes, Miss Joan. I’ll re- 
member.” So Joan Eunice again 
took her in her arms. “There, 
there, pet; don’t quiver your lip. 
I’ll take you with me, mostly. And 
if I don’t. I’ll tell you about it, 
mostly. But I might tell you a fib 
instead. I might have a date with 

151 




some horny interns and would not 
want to shock my Winsome.” 
“You’re teasing me.” 

“Not mean teasing. I’m at least 
half serious. Winnie, if you want 
to see your Bob no one in this 
house cares but me and my inter- 
est is friendly. But mel There are 
forty-odd people staring down my 
neck. If I ever have a man in my 
bed, the whole household will know 
it, and it’s at least fifty-fifty that 
some member of my ever-loyal 
staff would sell the fact to a news 
snoop and it would be on the 
morning gossip program — phrased 
so that I can’t sue without making 
it worse. Not?” 

“Uh . sounds horrible. But I 
guess it could happen.” 

“You know it could. Every gos- 
sip column, every gossip program, 
proves it. Hon, if a person is too 
rich, or too prominent, all the pub- 
lic lets him wear is the Emperor’s 
New Clothes — and what they like 
best is bad news, good news is too 
bland. Back when I was running it. 
Smith Enterprises spent many 
thousands of dollars every quar- 
ter to give me a totally false pub- 
lic image — poisonous phrase! — for 
business reasons. But that’s done 
with and now I’m fair game. Still 
more interesting fair game now 
that I’m miraculously young and 
female and pretty. No, beautiful 
— let’s be fair to Eunice Branca. 
You saw what they did yesterday; 
you watched the babble box. What 
would they do if they could prove 
something on me?” 

“Uh, something nasty, I guess.” 
“I know they would. I’m not 
guessing; I’ve had too many years 
of trying to avoid the spotlight. 



The old Romans knew what they 
were doing when they tossed living 
victims to the lions; most people 
are fairly decent — but collectively 
they love blood. I’m going to do 
something about getting out of the 
spotlight but in the meantime I’m 
vulnerable. Winnie, what would 
you do if I woke you some night 
and asked you to let me slide a 
man into your bed — so that you 
would be caught, not me. Be cer- 
tain to be caught, I mean, public 
as a show window. So caught that 
Bob would know, too.” 

The little girl took a deep 
breath. “I’d do it! Bob would un- 
derstand.” 

“Ah, but if I begged you not to 
explain it to Bob? Just take the 
rap for me?” 

“I’d still do it.” 

Joan kissed her. “I know you 
would. But you won’t have to, 
sweet Winsome. If — no, when — I 
slip, I won’t load it onto my chum. 
But I may ask you to tell lies for 
me some day — ^jigger for me — 
help me cover up. Would you?” 

“Of course I would.” 

“And I knew it and didn’t need 
to ask. It might be soon. I’m feel- 
ing more female every day. Now 
let’s play Christmas — I think that 
round, flubsy box is for Winnie.” 

S HORTLY Winifred was parad- 
ing in front of mirrors with an 
awed look on her face. “Oh, Joan, 
you shouldn’t have!” 

“That’s why I made you stay 
home. It’s a maid’s uniform, dear 
— an allowable deduction for me 
by terms of the Cooks, Domestics, 
and Hotel Workers approved con- 
tract.”

“Maid’s uniform indeed! It’s a 
Stagnaro Original straight from 
Rome; I read the label.” 

“As may be, I’ll tell my ac- 
countant to list it as a deduction 
just to annoy the IRS. Take it off, 
dear, and let’s see what else we 
find. Hey, here’s one for me.” 
Joan quickly got dressed. “What 
do you think? Of course with this 
I ought to have my body painted.” 
“I wouldn’t use paint if I were 
you. You look yummy and that 
off-white sets off your skin. It’s a 
delicious design even though kind 
o’ wicked. Joan, how do you know 
so much about buying women’s 
clothes? I mean, uh — ” 

“You mean, ‘How does an old 
man who hasn’t picked out a dress 
for a woman in at least half a cen- 
tury manage it?’ Genius, dear, 
sheer genius. You ought to hear 
my bird imitations.” (Hey! Don’t 
I get any credit?) (Not unless you 
want to break your cover, Mata 
Hari. The men in the white coats 
are just outside that door.) (Pee 
on you, twin. Maybe someday we 
can tell Winnie.) (I hope so, dar- 
ling — I not only love you. I’m 
proud of you.) {Kiss^) 

They worked down to two boxes 
which Joan had held back. When 
Winifred saw the synthetic emerald 
set — gee patch and two half-moon 
cups shaped for bare nipples — she 
gasped. “Oh, goodness! Put it on, 
Joan, and let me find your highest 
heels!” 

”You find your highest heels, 
darling — those green rhinestone 
stilts you were wearing earlier. 
They didn’t have stilts in your size 
to match this outfit. I’ve ordered 
them.” 



“This is for we? Oh, no!” 

“Then put it down the trash 
chute; gee-strings can’t be ex- 
changed. Winsome, that dress was 
designed for a redhead — and the 
cups are too small for me. Put it 
on. That envelope contains a floor- 
length transparent skirt, silk with a 
hint of matching green. With the 
skirt it’s just right for formal din- 
ner parties. You could wear one 
emerald on your forehead. Not 
any other jewelry. Or paint.” 

“But, Joan, I never go to that 
sort of party — I’ve never ever been 
invited to one.” 

“Perhaps it’s time I gave one; 
the banquet hall hasn’t been used 
in ten years. You would look 
beautiful — ^junior hostess at the 
other end of the long table. But, 
dear, besides an ultra-formal par- 
ty, it’s intended — without th? skirt 
— for most informal occasions. 
Would you enjoy wearing it for 
Bob — and would he enjoy taking 
it off?” 

Winifred caught her breath. “I 
can’t wait.” 

“Got a date tonight, hon?” 

“No, that’s why I said I can’t 
wait. Because I can’t resist it — 
want Bob to see me in it . want 
him to take it off me. Joan, I 
shouldn’t accept it, it’s much too 
expensive. But I will. Goodness, 
you make me feel like a kept 
woman.” 

“You are one, dear; I’m keep- 
ing you. And enjoying it very 
much.” 

The little nurse stopped smiling. 
Then she faced her mistress, 
looked up directly into her eyes. 
Joan, maybe I shouldn’t say this, 
maybe it’ll spoil everything. But I

think I must. Uh — ” She stopped 
and took a deep breath. “Two or 
three times it’s seemed to me you 
almost made a pass at me.” 
(There’s the pitch, twin! Too 
late for me to help.) “It’s been 
more than three times, Winifred.” 
“Well . yes. But why did you 
stop?” 

Joan sighed. “Because 1 was 
scared.” 

“Of me?” 

«AF me. Winsome darling— I’ve 
U done many hard things in my 
life. Such as waiting in a landing 
boat, bobbing around and seasick 
and stinking with fear . then 
dropping off into four feet of wa- 
ter with machine guns raking us 
and killing my buddies on both 
sides. But this is the hardest thing 
I’ve ever tried. Being a woman. I 
have to think about it every instant 
— do consciously the things you 
do automatically. Goodness, to- 
day I came within a split second of 
walking into a men’s toilet instead 
of the ladies’ powder room. And 
now you. Darling, can you guess 
what a temptation you are to me? 
Can you realize that old Johann is 
looking at your winsome loveli- 
ness out of Joan’s eyes? Winnie, 
there hasn’t been a moment but 
what I’ve wanted to touch you. 
Hold you in my lap. Kiss you. 
Make love to you. If I were a man 
. I’d be trying my damnedest to 
crowd Bob out. Or at least make 
room for me.” 

“Joan.” 

“Yes, dear?” 

“There’s room for you.” 

Joan found that she was trem- 
bling. “Darling! Pleasel Can’t we 



wait? You have Bob . and I have 
still to learn to be a woman.” She 
started to cry. 

And found Winifred’s arms 
around her. “Stop it, dear. Please 
stop. I didn’t mean to upset you. 
I’ll help, of course I’ll help. We’ll 
wait. Years if you need that long. 
Until you’re calmed down and 
sure of yourself — and want me. 
But Winnie isn’t trying to seduce 
her Joanie. Oh, it can be sweet, 
truly it can. But you’re right and I 
do have Bob and my nerves aren’t 
frayed the way yours must be. 
Some day you’ll fall in love with 
a man, and may forget all about 
me. Wanting to touch me, I mean 
— and that’s all right, as long as I 
can love you and be your friend.” 
Joan dashed away a tear, and 
sniffed. “Thank you, Winnie. I’ve 
made a fool of myself again.” 

“No, you haven’t. I just have 
trouble remembering, sometimes. 
Do you want a tranquilizer?” 

“No. I’m all right now.” 

“Would you rather I didn’t 
touch you?” 

“No. I want you to kiss me, 
Winnie. Hard. Best you ever have. 
Then put on the green gee-string 
dress and let us look at it. Then 
we’ll eat. And then grab some 
soap suds and make me smell bet- 
ter for our prayer meeting with 
Jake — I need those prayers to- 
night; they’re the right tranqui- 
lizer. Put it on, dear. But kiss me 
first.” 

Winnie kissed her — started to 
hold back, then flared like a prai- 
rie fire and did make it “best she 
ever had.” 

(Break, twin, before the house 
burns down. That’s the fanciest

tap dancing since Bojangles died.) 
(What do you know about Bo- 
jangles? You can’t know about 
him.) (Ever hear of classic films, 
Boss? Now see to it that Bob mar- 
ries her; you owe her that, for the 
hurdles you make her jump.) 
(How can I when I don’t know 
who he is?) (You can find out. 
Cheat. O’Neil knows. After you 
know who he is, find out what he 
wants; he’ll geek. Men\ Boss, I 
love you but sometimes I’m not 
sure why.) 

After Winnie modeled the em- 
erald dress she fetched in their 
trays from Joan’s upstairs lounge 
while Joan opened the last pack- 
age. It contained her present for 
Jake. “Winnie, tell me what you 
think of this?” 

It was a necklace rich and sim- 
ple — a heavy gold chain with 
tripled linkage, supporting a large 
gold ankh, a crux ansata. Wini- 
fred took it in her hands. “It’s 
lovely,” she said slowly. “But it’s 
not a woman’s necklace, you 
know. Or did you?” 

“It’s a man’s necklace. A pre- 
sent for Jake.” 

Winifred frowned slightly. 
“Joan, you do want me to help 
you learn how to behave as a 
woman.” 

“You know I do.” 

“Yes, I know. When I see that 
you are about to make a mis- 
take, I must tell you.” 

“You don’t think Jake will like 
this?” 

“I don’t know. He may not 
know what it means. And you may 
not know. This cross with a loop 
is called an ‘ankh’ — and it’s what 
my granddaddy would have called 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



a ‘heathen symbol.’ It means — 
well, it means most of the things 
our meditation prayer means, life 
and goodness and love and so 
forth. But specifically it means 
sex, it’s an ancient Egyptian sym- 
bol for the generative forces, both 
male and female. It’s no accident 
that the loop looks something like 
a vulva and that the rest of the de- 
sign could be interpreted as a male 
symbol. The way it’s used now — 
among people my age, people the 
age you have become — is . well, 
a wife could give it to her hus- 
band, or a husband could give a 
smaller one to his wife. Or they 
might not be married — but it al- 
ways means sexual love — flatly 
and no nonsense about it. If that’s 
not what you mean, Joan, if you 
just want to give him a nice neck- 
lace, take it back and exchange it 
for another that isn’t so specific 
in its symbolism. Any necklace 
means love — but perhaps you want 
one that a daughter could give 
her father.” 

Joan shook her head. “No, 
Winnie. I’ve known what the ankh 
means since a course in compar- 
ative religion, oh, three-quarters 
of a century ago. I assume that 
Jake knows, too; he has solid clas- 
sical training. I hadn’t been sure 
you kids knew its ancient mean- 
ing — I see I was mistaken. Winnie, 
this present is no accident; I’ve 
asked Jake to marry me several 
times. He won’t. Because of my 
age.” 

“Well ... I can see why he 
might feel that way.” 

“It’s ridiculous. Sure, I’m a 
quarter of century older than he 
is — but it no longer shows and I’m 



155 




healthy enough for marriage. Even 
though dear Doctor thinks I may 
drop dead.” 

“But — Doctor Garcia doesn’t 
really think you’ll drop dead. And 
I didn’t mean you were too old, I 
meant he — oh, dear!” 

“Yes, yes, I know. He’s being 
noble, damn him! But he doesn’t 
have to marry me, Winnie. I’ll 
accept any crumb I’m offered. 
This present is intended to say so.” 

Winifred looked solemn, sud- 
denly kissed the ankh and handed 
it back. “You and me both, Joan 
— any crumb we’re offered. Well, 
I wish you luck. With all my 
heart.” 

“Good Winnie. Let’s sop up 
some calories; it’s getting latish 
and Jake will be home — I hope — 
by twenty-one. I want to be clean 
as a kitten and just as pretty and 
smelling even prettier when the 
stubborn darling gets here. Help 
me?” 

“Love to. And look, Joanie, we 
douse you in Harem Breeze both 
the cologne and the perfume — 
and the powder. And I won’t 
wear any scent. I’ll scrub off what 
I’m wearing.” 

“No, we’ll renew the bait on 
you, too. Maybe we’ll hetero- 
dyne.” 

“ ‘Heterodyne?’ ” 

“Term that used to be used a 
lot in radio. In this case it means 
that if one girl isn’t enough, two 
might do the trick. Last night 
Jake was polite aJ)out^not staring 
. except that he was noticing my 
Winsome with both eyes all the 
time he was pretending not to. I’m 
not trying to crowd you into a 
Troy — but I have no scruples 

156 



about staking you out as bait.” 



T hey were out of the tub and 
working on the finishing touch- 
es when the house phone sounded. 
“Miss Smith. Mr. Salomon’s car 
just rolled in.” 

“Thank you, O’Neil.” 

A few minutes later Joan 
phoned the Green Suite. “Jake 
dear? This is your resident guru. 
If you wish to share a prayer meet- 
ing, guru and chela will call on 
you whenever you say.” 

“That’s welcome news; I’m 
tired — and last night was the best 
sleep I’ve had in years. Guru.” 

“I’m glad. Have you had din- 
ner?” 

“At the Gib, hours ago. Ready 
for bed now. If you’ll let me have, 
oh, twenty minutes, for a tub.” 
“Shall we be there in exactly 
twenty minutes? I don’t want 
to run into Hubert.” 

“1 sent him to bed. Nobody 
here but just us chickens.” 

“Twenty minutes, dear. Off.” 
Again two girls went bare- 
footed down the hallway. Joan was 
wearing, under a negligee, the 
ankh necklace. The door opened 
for them and Jake came toward 
them. He was wearing a bathrobe 
and had a book in hand with a fin- 
ger marking his place. “Hello, 
my dears. You both look charm- 
ing. Joan, I took the liberty of 
stopping in your downstairs li- 
brary and borrowing this book.” 
“It’s not a liberty and you know 
it. What is it, Jake?” 

He handed it to her. “Vishnude- 
vananda’s Yoga text. Thought 
there might be some of the sim- 

GALAXY 




pier postures I could try. But I’m 
afraid I must stick to medita- 

Joan looked puzzled. “This was 
downstairs?” She glanced at the 
endpaper, saw her bookplate: “Ex 
Libris — J S B Smith.” “I had for- 
gotten I owned it.” 

“You’re a pack rat, dear. This 
house must have ten thousand 
books in it.” 

“More, I think. There were that 
many the last time I had them 
catalogued. Well, after you’re 
done with it Winnie and I will 
look through it. We might find 
exercises we haven’t tried.” She 
handed it back, he put it aside. 
“Ready for autohypnosis?” 

“Ready for prayers and I’m 
sorry I sounded disparaging last 
night.” 

“I can’t see what difference a 
name makes, Jake. But first — ” 
Joan opened her robe, lifted the 
necklace from her neck. “A pre- 
sent for you, Jake. Bend your 
head down.” 

He did so. She placed it around 
his neck with the ceremonial kiss. 
He lifted the ankh, looked at it. 
“Thank you, Eunice. It’s a beau- 
tiful present. Am I to wear it 
now?” 

“As you wish. Or wear it in 
your mind — I know you’ve never 
been one for much jewelry. Ready, 
Winnie?” Joan Eunice dropped 
her robe, melted into lotus; Win- 
nie followed her. Jake got out of 
his bathrobe, leaving the neck- 
lace on, joined them. 

“Jake, will you lead us to- 
night? No need to say ‘hold’ or 
‘breathe,’ we’ll stay in step. Just 
like last night, a prayer for each of 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



the four parts. Keep the tempo 
slow.” 

“I’ll try. Om Mani Padme 
Hum!” 

(Om Mani Padme Hum.) 

J AKE SALOMON appeared to 
fall asleep instantly once they 
put him to bed. The girls quietly 
left the darkened room. Joan 
stopped a few feet down the hall. 
“Winnie, will you do something 
for me?” 

“Anything, dear.” 

“What time do people start 
stirring in the morning?” 

“I don’t know what time Cook 
gets up. About six, maybe. Mostly 
seven or near it. For the others, 
staff breakfast is at seven-thirty.” 
“Della doesn’t matter, she never 
comes upstairs. I mean this floor.” 
“Well, cleaning starts at nine. 
But no one cleans near your room 
until you phone down for your 
tray. Have you been disturbed?” 
“No. And I don’t mean to be. I 
guess Hubert is the only one who 
worries me. I’m going back and 
sleep with Jake.” 

“Oh!” 

“I’m not going this instant, I 
want to be sure he’s sound asleep. 
If he sleeps all night, I shan’t wake 
him; the poor dear needs his rest. 
But sleep with him I will! I don’t 
want Hubert barging in. Can you 
think of a way to divert him?” 

“Oh, I see. I’m pretty sure Hu- 
bert never goes to Mr. Salomon’s 
room until Mr. Salomon sends 
for breakfast and Hubert takes it 
up. Some mornings when I’ve eat- 
en downstairs and seen Hubert sit 
and drink coffee and watch the 
news, oh, quite a long time. Wait- 

157 




ing for Mr. Salomon to phone.” 

“That’s a relief. It’s not likely 
that anyone but you will know it, 
then. Not that I mind for myself, 
but I would hate to be the cause of 
Jake being dragged into a gossip 
item. All right, will you do three 
things for me? Read or sleep in my 
bed a while, muss it up. Stay all 
night if you like but muss yours, 
too. And will you set your alarm 
for eight and if I’m not in my own 
bed by then, phone the Green 
Suite? I’m sure Jake would rather 
know that you knew than have us 
caught by someone else. Then one 
other thing. Would you fetch me 
lounging pajamas and slippers? 
Then, if anything slips. I’ll put a 
bold face on it — I’ll be dressed and 
to hell with snoops. While you get 
them I’m going to put my robe 
down here and say a few more 
Money Hums. My mind is made 
up but I’m a touch nervy. Afraid 
Jake will scold me, I guess. 
(Afraid Jake won't scold you, / 
guess.) (Don’t you want us to, Eu- 
nice?) (Yes! Quit yattering and get 
on with it.) 

“Right away, Joan. Oh, I’m ex- 
cited myself! Uh, I think I’ll sleep 
in your bed. If you don’t mind.” 

“You know I don’t. But I may 
come back and wake you, most 
any time.” 

“Don’t mind. If you need a 
shoulder to cry on, I want to be 
there. Or maybe just for snuggle.” 

“Or I might have something to 
tell you. You don’t fool me a bit. 
Winsome. Never mind, I would 
like to find you there when I re- 
turn, no matter when or why.” 

A few minutes later Joan slipped 
silently into the bedroom of the 

158 



Green Suite, dropped her clothing 
without lighting a light, found her 
way to the bed by Jake’s soft 
snores. Cautiously she got into 
bed, felt the radiant warmth of his 
body close to hers, sighed happily 
and went to sleep. 

Some indefinite time later Joan 
felt a hand on her in the dark, 
came instantly awake. (What?) 
(General Quarters, twin! It’s 
now.) (I’m scared!) (I’ve taken 
over, dearest — the body remem- 
bers. Say a Money Hum.) 

Without a word Jake firmly 
took possession of her. 

(Oh, God, Eunice! Why didn’t 
you tell me?) (Tell you what?) 
(That for a woman it’s so much 
better^) (Is it?) (Ten times, a hun- 
dred times — I don’t know; I’m 
fainting.) (How could I guess that 
it’s better? Kiss him as you faint.) 

XXI 

T he occupation of the Okla- 
homa State House by the Peo- 
ple’s Agrarian Emergency Govern- 
ment continued. The Martian 
Manned Field Laboratory re- 
ported finding artifacts (age 1.4 x 
10* -I- 14% years) indicating ex- 
tinct human-equivalent intelli- 
gence. A second report signed by 
the Chinese members of the exped- 
ition denied that the exhibits were 
simply automatic and instinctive 
byproducts (analogous to coral 
rings, or to honeycombs) of sub- 
intelligent life closely related to 
the anaerobic life now present on 
Mars. The International Flat 
Earth Society in annual conven- 
tion in Surrey, England, passed its 
usual resolution petitioning the 

GALAXY 




United Nations to inflict sanctions 
on any national government wast- 
ing taxpayers’ money on alleged 
“space travel.” 

The suicide rate was up for the 
nineteenth successive year, as were 
also rates for death by accident 
and by violence. World population 
appreciation passed 300,000 per- 
sons per day and continued up, 
with six babies born every second 
vs. 2.5 persons dying each second, 
for a net gain of seven people ev- 
ery two seconds, 

A hen in Izard County, Arxan- 
sas, laid an egg with the Sign of 
the Cross on it. A spokesman for 
the Treasury Department, speak- 
ing off the record, announced that 
the Administration would not 
push the Administration bill for 
total abolition of paper currency 
in favor of universal credit cards 
and computer accounting. “We 
must face the fact,” he told the 
Washington Press Club, “that 
black market transactions, bribes, 
and other quasi-legal exchanges 
are as much part of our economy 
as is interest on the National Debt, 
and that to create conditions which 
would make these voluntary ex- 
changes impractical would bring 
on a depression the country could 
not stand. To put it poetically, 
gentlemen, the small amount of 
physical currency still in circula- 
tion — only a few billion — is our 
lubricant for the gears of progress. 
You have my assurance that the 
President recognizes this truth.” 

The First Satanist Church, Inc., 
(forty-four branches in California, 
five in other states) brought suit in 
Federal Court for relief from “dis- 
criminatory taxation.” The First 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



Disciple stated: “If other churches 
aren’t badgered and taxed and in- 
vestigated concerning their sacred 
objects, a Glory Hand should en- 
joy the same protection — that’s 
American as apple pie!” Reno 
again repealed its ordinance for 
licensed prostitution. The City 
Manager stated that the fees 
weren’t sufficient to pay the in- 
spectors . and besides, there 
wasn’t all that much commercial 
prostitution anyhow since the 
closing of the Federal Youth 
Training Center. 

The Rally for Human Beings 
gained speed in its drive to fold, 
spindle and mutilate computer 
cards and drop them into the near- 
est mail box — despite arrests by 
Postal Inspectors there was almost 
no cooperation by local police and 
no jury had brought in a verdict of 
guilty no matter how compelling 
the evidence. The Post Office’s 
Chief Inspector stated that the 
mutilated cards were almost al- 
ways bills and that, so far, no 
mutilated checks or money orders 
had been reported — and that the 
government had no great interest 
in the matter but he was getting 
damn sick and tired of the coun- 
try’s mail boxes being used as 
trash baskets. 

The chairman of the Rally for 
Human Beings answered that the 
country’s mail boxes had been 
trash baskets for years and both 
the Postmaster General and Con- 
gress knew why. The traffic com- 
puter for downtown Houston went 
into spastic breakdown during the 
evening rush hour leaving thou- 
sands of people stranded on the 
streets overnight; the estimated 

159 




deaths exceeded seven thousand, 
including heart stoppage, smog 
poisoning, and mugging, but ex- 
cluding suicide. The Southern 
States Automobile Assurance 
Companies Trade Association re- 
pudiated all claims based on the 
incident on the theory that deaths 
or injuries in stationary vehicles 
were not covered by the (fine 
print). 

The Lunar Colonies dedicated 
two more superlarge “balanced- 
aquarium” Food Caves, The 
George Washington Carver and 
the Gregor Mendel, and the Com- 
mission again announced an in- 
crease in subsidized outmigration 
quota but again with no relaxation 
in standards (the injunction against 
the Commission issued by Mr. 
Justice Handy of the United States 
Supreme Court was quietly 
ignored on the grounds of no juris- 
diction). The common stock of 
Las-Vegas-in-the-Sky continued to 
move up against the downward 
trend of the Market; most invest- 
ment advice peddlers remained 
bullish, basing their expectations 
on past correlations between 
weather, the Market, and women’s 
styles. The Interstellar Advisory 
Subcommittee to the Lunar Com- 
mission settled on Tau Ceti rather 
than Alpha Centauri for the first 
attempt. Jodrell Bank lost touch 
with the Manned Pluto Probe. The 
(official) casualties in Ukraine 
dropped below the (official) casu- 
alties in Matto Grosso — and in 
both places the dead did not argue. 

“ — whereas ‘id’ is not a scien- 
tific concept; it is merely the first 
syllable of UdiotV ... as my es- 
teemed colleague should know

best” “ — will be order in the 
courtroom.” “ — let me cite the in- 
contestable conclusions of that 
great scientist — ” “garbage in, 
garbage out! Any graduate assis- 
tant can draw pretty graphs and 
make half-bright conclusions from 
irrelevant data.” “May I ask my 
esteemed colleague to repeat that 
slur outside the courtroom?” 
“ — Bailiff is directed to keep order

we’ll get this so fouled up that no-

“Is Counsel for the challenged 
party suggesting that this is not 
Jose Branca?” “Goodness, no. I’ll 
help identify him if you need me. 
I’m simply urging that you lay a 
proper foundation.” (“Jake, Joe 
looks ghastly. I must go see him 
as soon as this nonsense is over.” 
“Do you think that is wise?” “I 
don’t know, Jake. But I know that

“Look around you, Mr. 
Branca. Tell the Court — tell the 
Judge, that is — whether or not 
your wife is in this room?” “Not 
here.” “Mr. Branca, look where I 
am pointing.” “Not here, I told 
you!” “Your Honor, we are faced 
with a reluctant witness. It be- 
comes necessary to lead him.” 
“Very well. But Counsel is re- 
minded that he cannot impeach 
his own witness.” “Thank you. 
Your Honor. Mr. Branca, I am 
pointing at this young woman, 
look at her closely. I have my 
hand on her shoulder — ” “Keep

he puts a hand on me again. I’ll

again. Your witness knows which 
young woman you mean.” “Very 
well. Your Honor — and if I have 
given offense to this young lady, I 
am sorry. Mr. Branca, I put it to 
you that this is your wife, Eunice 
Branca nee Evans.” 

“Not Eunice. She dead. Judge, 
do I gotta take this kark? That 
lyin’ fixer knows t’ score, he talk 
to me two, three hours. Sure, 
that’s Eunice’ body. But she’s 
dead. Everybody knows what hap- 
pen.” 

“Sorry, Your Honor. Mr. 
Branca, please confine yourself to 
answering my questions. You say 
your wife is dead . but did you 
ever see your wife Euncie Branca 
dead?” 

“Huh? No. This operation — ” 
“Just answer the question. You 
never at any time saw her dead. I 
put it to you that you were paid 
one million dollars to testify that 
this woman is not your wife Eu- 
nice Branca.” (“Jake, can they do 
this to Joe? Look at him.” “I’m 
sorry, darling. I didn’t call him.”) 
“Judge, this karky bastard’s 
lyin’ \ They, got this club, see? Rare 
Blood. I got this funny blood, see? 
Eunice, too. Save lives. Sure, they 
offer money, thousand, million, I 
don’t know, don’t care. You think 
I’m a pimp, maybe? For Eunice! I 
tell ’em shove it. I — ” 

“Your Honor, I pray your help 
in bringing this witness to order.” 

“I think he’s making a respon- 
sive answer to your question. Go 
on, Mr. Branca. They offered you 
money. For what?” 

“Oh. Eunice got a boss, see? 
Mr. Smith. Johann Smith. So rich 
he karks in gold pot. But poor old 

161 




muck is dying, see? Only the med- 
icares don’ let him die. Pitiful. But 
he’s got this same funny blood, 
see? Like me, like Eunice. I tell 
’em, sure, he can have Eunice’ 
body, she don’ need it no more — 
but not for money. So we rig a 
swindle — me and his fixer over 
there, Mr. Jake Salomon. He 
knows how I feel, he helps. ‘Eu- 
nice Evans Branca Memorial

paid to t’ Rare Blood Club. Ask 
Mr. Jake Salomon, he knows.

— he won’t even look at me. ’ “Put 
your veil up, dear, and cry under 
it.’’) 

“Does Counsel for Petitioners 
have any more questions to ask 
this witness?” 

“No, Your Honor. Counsel 
may inquire.” 

“No cross-examination. Your 
Honor.” 

“Does either counsel wish to 
question this witness at a later 
time? This is not a trial and the 
Court intends to allow the widest 
latitude for inquiry even at the 
cost of permitting irrelevancies to 
creep into the record. Will Coun- 
sel please answer?” 

“Petitioners have no further 
use for this witness.” 

“No questions now or later. 
Your Honor.” 

“Very well. Court will recon- 
vene at ten tomorrow morning. 
Bailiff is directed to provide this 
witness with transportation home 
or wherever he wishes to go, and 
to protect him from annoyance in 
so doing. Off the top, Evelyn, he’s 
been harried enough.” 

162 



“Judge? Can I say sump’n?” 

“If you wish, Mr. Branca.” 
“That karky fixer — not Mr. 
Salomon, other one. Gets dark 
every night. Some nights he winds 
up in Bird’s Nest turf.” 

“Order. Mr. Branca, you must 
not make threats in court.” 

‘ ‘Wasn’t no threat. Judge. Was 
prophesying. I wouldn’t hurt any- 
body. But Eunice had lots and lots 
and lots of friends.” 

“Very well. You’re excused, 
Mr. Branca; you won’t have to 
come back. Clerk will take charge 
of exhibits; Bailiff will provide 
heel-and-toe guards. Recessed.” 



« ALL rise!” “ — greatest possi- 
^ble respect for the scholarly 
qualifications of my distinguished 
colleague, nevertheless the opin- 
ions he has expressed are the most 
arrant nonsense, as proved by that 
great scientist in his paper of nine-

quote: ‘The very concept of “per-

“ — shocked to discover that the 
learned judge presiding over this 
trial is in fact a fraternity brother 
of Johann S. B. Smith. This clan- 
destine relationship may be veri- 
fied in records open to the public 
and I ask that this Court today, 
and any later courts seeing this 
record, take judicial notice, and I 
demand that opposing counsel 
stipulate the fact.” 

“Stipulated.” (“Jake, how did 
they find out?” “We leaked it. 
Through Alec, last night. Time to 
get it into the record, rather than 
in an appeal.”) 

“Aha! This damning fact having 
been stipulated. Petitioners are 
now forced to demand that the 
judge presiding disqualify himself 
and declare this a mistrial.” 
(“Jake, seems to me they’ve got 
us on the hip. Much as I like Mac 
and Alec, I have to admit that 
this has the flavor of finding a 
strawberry mark on a missing 
heir.” “No, my dear. In the course 
of a long life a prominent man ac- 
quires direct linkage to every other 
prominent man. If it hadn’t turned 
out that you and Mac were in the 
same fraternity, it would have been 
some other link as close or closer. 
How many members of the Su- 
preme Court do you know?” “Uh 
... I think it’s five.” “There’s your 
answer. At the top of the pyramid 
everybody knows everybody else.”) 
(And sleeps with them.) (Shut up, 
Eunice!) 

“Counsel, I find this interesting. 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



First let me set you straight on a 
point of law. Twice you have used 
the word ‘trial’ and now you 
speak of a ‘mistrial.’ This is, as 
you know, not a trial, it is not 
even an adversary situation; it is 
merely an inquiry for the purpose 
determining the identity of the 
young woman there who calls her- 
self Miss Smith. She is charged 
with no crime, no civil suit against 
her is before this court; it is simply 
that her claimed identity has been 
challenged by petitioners who as- 
sert an interest. So this court is 
assisting in a friendly investigation 
— helping like a good neighbor in 
attempting to straighten out a 
mixup. Not a trial.” 

“I stand corrected. Your Hon- 
or.” 

“Please be careful in your use 
of technical language. If there is 
no trial, there can be no mistrial. 
Do you agree?” 

“Perhaps I should use other 
language. Your Honor. Petition- 
ers feel that, under these disclosed 
circumstances, you are not the 
judge who should preside over this, 
uh, friendly investigation.” 

“That is possible. But the mat- 
ter has reached me in the course 
of due process and it will continue 
to remain before me unless com- 
pelling reasons are shown why I 
should step aside. Again on the 
matter of language, you used the 
word ‘clandestine.’ The Court will 
not at this moment consider 
whether or not Counsel’s choice of 
this word implies contempt — ” 
“Your Honor, I assure you — ” 
“Order. I am speaking. Nor will 
you discuss that aspect at this 
time. We will now consider only 

163 




the meaning of this word. ‘Clan- 
destine’ means ‘hidden, secret, 
concealed’ with a flavor or conno- 
tation of surreptitious, or under- 
handed, or illicit. Tell me — this 
alleged relationship: Could it be 
verified in ‘Who’s Who’?” 

“Oh, certainly. Your Honor! 
That’s where I found it.” 

“I know that my own fraternity 
is noted there; I assume that if ap- 
propriate it would be listed in the 
case of Johann Sebastian Bach 
Smith. Since you tell me that you 
have checked it, the Court takes 
judicial notice for whatever it is 
worth and requires no further sub- 
stantiation . other than to com- 
ment that we could hardly have 
been members of the same chapter 
at the same time since we differ by 
almost half a century in age. Did 
your investigations show that 
Johann Smith and I were jointly 
members of other organizations? 
For example Johann Smith was a 
founding member of the Gibraltar 
Club — and I am a member, and 
Miss Smith’s counsel Mr. Salo- 
mon is a member . and you are 
a member. In what other organiza- 
tions do I share membership with 
Johann Smith? Now or in the 
past.” 

“Uh . Petitioners have not in- 
vestigated.” 

“Oh, come now, I feel sure that 
you could turn up others. The Red 
Cross, for example. Probably the 
Chamber of Commerce at some 
time. I seem to recall that when I 
was a Scout Commissioner Jo- 
hann Smith was one also. Possibly 
we’re both in other fraternal 
bodies. Almost certainly we have 
served as trustees, or such, for the 

164 



same charitable or service groups, 
either simultaneously or succes- 
sively. I note that you are a 
Shriner, so am I. Care to com- 
ment on the fact?” 

“No comment. Your Honor.” 
“But you and I almost certainly 
share several fraternal bonds. The 
Court takes notice of the wry fact 
that, since lawyers are not permit- 
ted to advertise, as a class they 
tend to join more organizations — 
fraternal, social, service, and reli- 
gious — than do laymen as a class. 
Since you choose not to comment 
on the ones that you and I share 
in common, the Court will on its 
own motion investigate and place 
the results in the record. Now as 
to my alleged obligation to dis- 
qualify myself, do you wish to 
clarify your reasoning? Think it 
over while we take a recess. Your 
answer will go into the record. 
Ten minutes.” 

« f|RDER. Counsel for the Peti- 
wtioners? You have had time to 
think.” 

“Petitioners move that all re- 
marks concerning fraternal associ- 
ations and like matters be struck 
from the record.” 

“Motion denied. Nothing will 
be struck from this record. Come 
now. Counselor, you must have 
had some theory. State it.” 

“Your Honor, at the time I 
raised the point it seemed impor- 
tant. I now no longer think so.” 
“But you must have had a the- 
ory or you would not have raised 
it. Please speak freely, I want to 
know.” 

“Well ... if Your Honor will 
indulge me, the disclosed fact 

GALAXY 




seemed to admit of the possibility 
of prejudice on the part of the 
Court. No contempt is intended.” 
“And the Court will assume 
that none exists. But your answer 
is less than complete. Prejudice 
in favor of whom? The Petitioners? 
Because of my fraternal relation- 
ship with their grandparent?” 
“What? Oh, no, Your Honor — 
prejudice in favor of, uh, of Miss 
— the challenged party.” 

“You are stipulating that she 
is indeed Johann Sebastian Bach 
Smith?” (“My God, Jake, Mac’s 
got him biting his own tail.” “Yes. 
Who has got whom on whose 
hip?”) 

“No, no. Your Honor, we are 
not stipulating that. This is the 
very matter we are challenging.” 
“But Counsel cannot have it 
both ways. If this young woman is 
not Johann Sebastian Bach Smith 
— as Petitioners allege — then she 
is not of my college fraternity. 
Conversely, under your own theo- 
ry, she is Johann Sebastian Bach 
Smith. Which way will you have 
it?” 

“I’m afraid I have been guilty of 
faulty reasoning. I pray the 
Court’s indulgence.” 

“We all reason faultily at times. 
Are you quite finished? Shall we 
go on with examination of wit- 
nesses?” 

“Quite finished. Your Honor.” 

B ut, Dr. Boyle, do you know 
that you removed the brain 
from this body — this cadaver, and 
transplanted it into the body of 
that woman?” 

“Don’t be an ass, old chap. You 
heard my answer.” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“Your Honor, Petitioners feel 
that this is proper cross-examina- 
tion and ask for the Court’s as- 
sistance.” 

“The Court orders the witness 
to answer the questions as 
stated.” 

“Judge, you don’t scare me, y’ 
know. I am here as a voluntary 
witness — and I am not and never 
was a citizen of your quaint coun- 
try. I am now a citizen of China. 
Your State Department promised 
our Foreign Affairs Minister that 
I would have full immunity during 
my entire stay if only I would ap- 
pear. So don’t bother to throw 
your weight around; it won’t go. 
Care to see my passport? Diplo- 
matic immunity.” 

“Dr. Boyle, this court is aware 
of your immunity. However, you- 
have been induced to come here — 
at considerable expense I would 
assume and clearly at some incon- 
venience to you — to give evidence 
that only you can give. The Court 
requests you to answer all ques- 
tions put to you, as fully, explicit- 
ly, and clearly as possible, in terms 
a layman can comprehend, even if 
it means repeating yourself. We 
want to find out exactly what you 
did and what you know of your 
own knowledge, which might di- 
rectly or indirectly assist this court 
in determining the identity of this 
woman.” 

“Oh, certainly, my dear fellow 
— put that way. Well, let’s go 
back and run it through again, 
from A to Zed. A year ago, more 
or less, I was approached by that 
old bugger over there — sorry, I 
mean barrister — Mr. Jacob Salo- 
mon — to do what the Sunday 

165 




sheets call a brain transplant. I 
accepted the commission. After 
this and that — you can get the triv- 
ia from him — I did it. Moved a 
brain and some ancillary parts 
from one human skull to another. 
That brain was alive in its new digs 
when I left. 

“Now as to whom. The brain 
donor was a very elderly male, the 
body donor was a young mature 
female. And that is about the size 
of it — they are covered, y’ know, 
sterile sheeting and such, before 
the surgeon in charge comes in. 
Prepped. I can add only these 
hints: The male was in bad shape, 
kept alive by major supportive 
means. The female was in worse 
shape, she was dead — massive 
trauma to skull and cortex about 
here — head bashed in, I mean to 
say, and the yolk spattered. Dead 
as Queen Anne save that her body 
had been kept alive , by extreme 
support measures. 

“Now that unsightly hunk of 
pickled meat over there has had 
its brain et cetera removed in a 
fashion consistent with my own — 
unique — surgical techniques; I 

doubt if there is another surgeon 
alive who can do it my way. I have 
examined that cadaver carefully; 
I conclude that it is my work — 
and, by elimination, I conclude 
that it must be the body Salomon 
hired me to carve on; there is no 
conflicting evidence and the ca- 
daver is not from any other case 
of mine. 

“Identifying the young female 
is another matter. If her head were 
shaved I might look for scar tis- 
sue. If her skull were x-rayed I 
might look for prosthesis; teflon 

166 



vitae does not throw the same 
shadow on a plate as does natural 
bone. But such tests would be only 
indicative; scar tissue is easily 
come by, and other trephining 
could produce similar x-ray shad- 
ow without disturbing the central 
nervous system.” 

“Dr. Boyle, let us stipulate mo- 
mentarily that you removed a liv- 
ing brain from exhibit JJ, the ca- 
daver — ” 

“Stipulate? I did do so, you 
heard me say so.” 

“I am not contradicting you, I 
am simply using appropriate lan- 
guage. Very well, you have so tes- 
tified and you have also testified 
that you transplanted that brain 
into a young female body. Look 
about and see if you can identify 
that female body.” 

“Oh, you’re being an ass again. 
I am neither a witch doctor nor a 
beauty contest judge; I am a sur- 
geon. No, thank you. If that 
young woman — that composite 
human, female body, male brain — 
survived and is alive today — a 
point on which I have no opinion 
of my own knowledge and I as- 
sure you that I have had strong 
reason to acquaint myself both 
with relevant forensic medicine 
and medical jurisprudence; you 
are not about to trip me into being 
the ass you are — I would not to- 
day be able to single her out with 
certainty from ten thousand other 
young women of approximately 
the same size, weight, build, skin 
shade, and such. Counsel, have 
you ever seen a human body 
hooked up for extreme life sup- 
port and prepared for such sur- 
gery? I’m sure you have not or 



GALAXY 




you would not ask such silly ques- 
tions. But I assure you that you 
would not recognize your own 
wife under such circumstances. If 
you want me to perjure myself, 
you’ve come to the wrong shop.” 
“Your Honor, Petitioners seem 
unable to get a responsive answer 
on this key point.” 

“The Court finds it responsive. 
Witness states that he can and 
does identify the male body but is 
unable to identify the female body. 
Doctor, I confess that I am puz- 
zled on one point — perhaps 
through not being a medical man 
myself; nevertheless I am puzzled. 
Are we to understand that you 
would perform such an operation 
without being certain of the iden- 
tity of the bodies?” 

“Judge, I’ve never been ope to 
fret about trivia. Mr. Salomon 
assured me, in legalistic language, 
that the fix was on if I have your 
American idiom correct. His as- 
surances meant to me that the pa- 
per work was done, the legal re- 
quirements met, et cetera, and that 
I was free to operate. I believed 
him and did so. Was I mistaken? 
Should I expect an attempt to ex- 
tradite me after I return home? I 
think it would be difficult; I have 
at last found a country where my 
work is respected.” 

“I am not aware that anyone has 
any intention of trying to extradite 
you. I was curious, that’s all. 
What Counsel was getting at is 
this: There is present in this room 
a woman who claims to be that 
composite from your surgery. 
You can’t point her out?” 

“Oh, certainly I can. Though 
not as a sworn witness. It’s that 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



young lady seated by Jake Salo- 
mon. How are you, my dear? 
Feeling chipper?” 

“Very much so. Doctor.” 

“Sorry if I’ve disappointed you. 
Oh, I could make positive identi- 
fication ... by sawing off the top 
of your skull, then digging out 
your brain and looking for cer- 
tain indications. But — heh heh! — 
you would not be much use to 
yourself afterwards. I prefer seeing 
you alive, a monument to my 
skill.” 

“I prefer it, too. Doctor — and 
truly. I’m not disappointed. I’m 
eternally grateful to you.” 

“Your Honor, this is hardly 
proper!” 

“Counsel, I will be the judge of 
that. Under these most unusual 
circumstances I will permit a few 
human amenities in court.” 

“Miss Smith, I’d like to exam- 
ine you before I go home. For my 
journal, you know.” 

“Certainly, Doctor! Anything — 
short of sawing off my skull.” 

“Oh, just chest-thumping and 
such. The usual rituals. Shall we 
say tommorow morning, ten 
o’clockish?” 

“My car will be waiting for you 
at nine-thirty. Doctor. Or earlier, 
if you will do me the honor of hav- 
ing breakfast with me.” 

“The Court finds it necessary to 
interrupt. I’m sorry to say that 
both of you will be here at ten 
o’clock. The hour for recessing is 
almost on us and — ” 

“No, Judge.” 

“What, Dr. Boyle?” 

“I said, ‘No.’ I will not be here 
tomorrow morning. I speak this 
evening at twenty o’clock at a din- 

167 




ner of one of your chop-’em-up 
societies. The American College 
of Surgeons. Until shortly before 
that time I am at your disposal. I 
suppose you can require the pres- 
ence of Miss Smith tomorrow 
morning, but not mine. I’m off to 
merry old China as quickly as pos- 
sible. No shortage of opportunities 
for research there — you would be 
amazed what condemned prisoners 
will agree to. So I shan’t waste 
another day on silly-ass questions. 
But I am willing to tolerate them 
now.” 

“Mmm — I’m afraid that the 
Court must concede that this is a 
case of Mahomet and the Moun- 
tain. Very well, we will not recess 
at trie usual hour.” 

^<1|^ITNESS will stand down. 

VV Do Petitioners offer more 
witnesses?” 

“No, Your Honor.” 

“Counsel?” 

“Miss Johann Smith offers no 
further evidence.” 

“Mr. Salomon, is it your inten- 
tion to present an argument or 
summary?” 

“No, Your Honor. The facts 
speak for themselves.” 

“Petitioners?” 

“Your Honor, it is your inten- 
tion to bring this to a terminus to- 
dayT 

“That’s what I am trying to find 
out. We’ve been at this for many 
weary days and I find myself in 
sympathy with Dr. Boyle’s atti- 
tude: Let’s sweep up the mess and 
go home. Both sides agree that 
there are no more witnesses, no 
more questions, no more exhibits. 
Counsel for Miss Smith states 

168 



that he will not offer an argu- 
ment. If Petitioners’ counsel 
wishes to argue, he may do so — 
in which case Miss Smith, in per- 
son or through counsel or both, is 
privileged to rebut. What I had in 
mind. Counsel, was a recess . 
then, if you have your thoughts in 
order, you can say what you wish. 
If you can’t we can let it go over 
till tomorrow morning. You may 
at that time argue for a postpone- 
ment — but I warn you that a 
lengthy postponement will not be 
tolerated; the Court has become 
impatient with delaying tactics and 
red herrings, not to mention lan- 
guage and attitudes flavored with 
contempt. What is your wish?” 

“May it please the court, if we 
continue this evening, how long a 
recess does the court contem- 
plate?” 

“ — and rebuttal having been 
concluded, we are ready to rule. 
But first a statement by the Court. 
Inasmuch as a novel point in Con- 
stitutional Law is involved in this 
matter, if an appeal is made, the 
Court will, under the Declaratory 
Relief Act of 1984, on its own 
motion send the matter directly tO: 
Federal Appellate Court with re- 
commendation that it be referred 
at once to the Supreme Court. We 
cannot say that this will happen 
but there are aspects which lead us 
to believe that it could happen; 
this matter is not trivial. 

“We have heard the petition, we 
have heard witnesses and seen ex- 
hibits. It is possible to rule in one 
of four ways: 

“That both Johann Sebastian 
Bach Smith and Eunice Evans 
Branca are alive and among us; 

GALAXY 




“That Eunice is alive and Joh- 
ann is dead; 

“That Eunice is dead and Joh- 
ann is alive; 

“That both Eunice and Johann 
are dead. 

“The Court rules — please stand 
up, Miss Smith — that this person 
before us is a physiological com- 
posite of the body of Eunice Evans 
Branca and the brain of Johann 
Sebastian Bach Smith and that in 
accordance with the equitable 
principle set forth in ‘Estate of

“ — take it that you are offering 
me your lovely body. Sorry, 
m’dear. I have no interest in wom- 
en. Nor in men. Nor in rubber 
garments or high heels or other 
toys. I’m a sadist. Miss Smith. A 
genius sadist who realized quite 
young that he must become a sur- 
geon to stay out of the clutches of 
Jack Ketch. Sublimation, y’know. 
Thanks just the same. A pity, you 
do have a magnificent body.” 
(Well, Boss, you got turned down. 
It’s a lesson every woman must 
learn. So you brush your hair and 
start all over again.) 

(Eunice, I’m relieved. But he 
was entitled to the lagniappe if he 
wanted it.) “I’m your Galatea, 
Dr. Boyle; I owe you anything you 
care to name — short of sawing off 
my skull. The debt remains on the 
books. All I was offering was sym- 
bolic downpayment. But you don’t 
respond like a typical Australian — 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



nor sound much like one, either.” 
“Oh, that. I’m a fake, dear. 
From the Sydney slums into a sad- 
ists’ finishing school — a stylish 
British boarding school, a ‘public’ 
school right out of the second 
drawer. Then on to the University 
of London and the best surgeons 
in the world. Put your pretty robe 
on and I’ll be going. I say, would 
you mind having that extr’ordinary 
slow-motion somersault filmed in 
stereocinema for my archives?” 
“Where shall I send it. Doctor?” 
“Jake Salomon knows. Keep 
your pecker up, m’dear, and try 
to live a long time; you’re my 
masterpiece.” 

“I’ll certainly try.” 

“Do. Tata!” 

A n unidentified flying ob- 
ject roughly disc-shaped was 
reported to have landed in Per- 
nambuco and its humanoid crew 
to have visited with local yokels; 
the report was denied officially al- 
most faster than it reached the 
news services. The number of li- 
censed private police in the United 
States reached triple the number 
of public peace officers. Miss Joan 
— nee Johann — Smith received 
over two thousand proposals of 
marriage, more than that number 
of less formal proposals, one hun- 
dred eighty-seven death threats, an 
undisclosed number of extortion 
notes and four bombs — not any of 
which she received in person as 
they were diverted to Mercury Pri- 
vate Courier Service under pro- 
cedures set up years earlier. The 
waldoes of one package-opening 
bunker had to be replaced; the 
other bombs were disarmed.

The Postmaster General died 
from an overdose of barbiturates; 
the career Assistant Postmaster 
General declined an interim ap- 
pointment and put in for retire- 
ment. A woman in Albany gave 
birth to a “faun” which was bap- 
tized, dead, and cremated in 
eighty-seven minutes. No flowers. 
No photographs. No interviews — 
but the priest wrote a letter to his 
seminary roommate. The F.B.l. 
reported that recidivism was up to 
71%, while the same rate figured 
only on major felonies — armed 
robbery, rape, assault with a dead- 
ly weapon, murder, and attempted 
murder — had climlied to 84%. The 
paralysis at Harvard University 
continued. 

MIAKE, the last time you re- 

J fused to marry me, you did 
promise me a night on the town if 
we won.” 

Mr. Salomon put down his cup. 
“A delightful lunch, my dear. As 
I recall, you told me at the time 
that a night club check was no 
substitute for a marriage license.” 

“Nor is it. But I haven’t nagged 
you about marrying me since you 
accorded me the honor of first 
concubine. Uh . erase ‘first.’ I 
have no idea what you do with 
your time when you’re not here. 
Well, I don’t have to be ‘first.’ ” 
(Twin, never crowd a man about 
sex. He’ll lie.) (Pussy cat. I’m not 
crowding Jake about sex'. I’m con- 
fusing the issue. He’s going to 
take us night-clubbing and we’re 
going to wear that lush blue-and- 
gold job — it’s meant to be seen, 
not just modeled for Winnie and 
put away.)

“Eunice, surely you don’t think 
I have anyone else?” 

“It would be presumptuous of 
me to have an opinion, sir. Jake, 
I’ve stayed close to home all dur- 
ing this hearing — a little shopping, 
mostly with Winnie along. But 
now we’ve won and I see no rea- 
son to be a prisoner. Look, dear, 
we can make it a party of four — 
a girl for you and a boy for me — 
and you can come home early 
and not lose any sleep you don’t 
want to.” 

“You surely don’t think that I 
would go home and leave you at 
a night club?” 

“I surely think I can stay up all 
night and celebrate if I want to. 
I’m free, over twenty-one — my 
God, am I over twenty-one! — and 
can afford a licensed escort. But 
there is no reason to keep you up 
all night. We’ll call Gold Seal 
Bonded Escorts and fill out our 
party. Winnie’s been teaching me 
what the kids call dancing — and 
I’ve been teaching her real dancing. 
Say, maybe you’d rather escort 
Winnie than some dollikin picked 
out of a catalog? Winnie thinks 
you’re wonderful.” 

“Eunice, are you seriously pro- 
posing to hire a gigolo?” 

“Jake, I’m not going to marry 
him. I’m not even going to sleep 
with him. I expect him to dance 
with me, smile, and make polite 
conversation — at about .what a 
plumber charges. This is doom?” 

“I won’t have it.” 

“If you won’t — and Heaven 
knows I would rather be on your 
arm than that of a paid escort — 
will you take a nap? I’ll get a nap, 
too. Do you need help to get to 

GALAXY 




sleep? Money Hums, I mean, not 
horizontal calisthenics. Although 
we have that in stock, too.” 

“I don’t recall saying that we. 
were going out. Nor is there any- 
thing to celebrate, Eunice. We 
haven’t won until the Supreme 
Court rules on it.” 

“We have plenty to celebrate. 
I’m legally me — thanks to you, 
darling — and you no longer have 
to report as my conservator; my 
granddaughters have lost on all 
points. If we hold off celebrating 
until the Supreme Court maun- 
ders over it, we might both be 
dead.” 

“Oh, nonsense! You know I’m 
about to leave for Washington; I 
expect to be able to arrange for 
an early spot on the calendar. Be 
patient.” 

“Patient is what I’m not, dear. 
Surely, you’ll arrange it; you al- 
wasys do arrange things — and the 
Administration owes me that and 
will expect more from me. But, 
Jake, your jet might crash — ” 

“That doesn’t sway me, it’s my 
death-of-choice. Since my genetic 
background doesn’t permit me to 
hope for heart failure. I’ve been 
counting on cancer. But a crash 
is still better. Anything but a long, 
slow, helpless dying.” 

“You’re rubbing my nose in 
the mistake I made, sir. Will you 
let me finish? You once pointed 
out that you had only ten or twelve 
years, based on the actuarials — 
whereas I had at least half a cen- 
tury. Not true, Jake. My life ex- 
pectancy is null.” 

“Eunice, what the devil are you 
talking about?” 

“The truth. Truth you have 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



conveniently forgotten — but which 
I am aware of every golden second. 
I’m a transplant, Jake. A unique 
transplant. No statistics apply to 
me. Nobody knows, no one can 
guess. So I live each wonderful 
day as all eternity. Jake my be- 
loved master. I’m not being mor- 
bid — I’m being happy. When I was 
a little boy there was a prayer 
Mama taught me. It goes — 

“Now I lay me down to sleep; 

“I pray the Lord my soul to 
keep. 

“If I should die before I wake, 

“I pray the Lord my soul to 
take. 

“It’s like that, Jake. I had not 
used the prayer in almost ninety 
years. But now I use it . and 
go happily to sleep, unworried 
about tomorrow.” (Twin! You 
lying little bitch! All you ever say 
is a Money Hum.) (It’s the same 
thing. Puss. A prayer means what 
you want it to mean.) 

“Joan Eunice, you once told 
me that you had no religion. So 
why do you say this child’s pray- 
er?” 

“As I recall, what I told you 
was that I had been a relaxed ag- 
nostic — until I was dead for a 
while. I’m still an agnostic — mean- 
ing that I don’t have any answers 
— but I am now a happy agnostic, 
one who feels sure deep in her 
heart that the world has meaning, 
is somehow good, and that my 
being here has purpose, even if I 
don’t know what it is. As for that 
prayer, a prayer means whatever 
you make it mean; it’s an inner 
ritual. What this one means to me 
is a good intention — to live every 
moment as Eunice would live it, 

171 




did live — serenely, happily, and un- 
worried by any later moment in- 
cluding death. Jake, you said you 
were still worried about Parkin- 
son.” 

“Somewhat. As a lawyer, I 
don’t see how he can get his hands 
on it again. But as a shyster at 
heart — don’t quote me! — who has 
taken part in many a back-room 
deal, 1 know that even the Su- 
preme Court is made up of men, 
not angels met in judgment. Eu- 
nice, there are five honest men on 
that court . and four from 
whom 1 would never buy a used 
car. But of the honest ones, one 
is senile. We’ll see what we shall 
see.” 

“So we will, Jake. But don’t 
give Parky a thought. The worst 
he can do is to strip me of money. 
Which I wouldn’t mind; I’ve dis- 
covered that more money than is 
needed for current bills is a bur- 
den. Jake, I’ve got enough tucked 
away that even you don’t know 
about that I’ll never miss any 
meals. Parky con’t touch it. As 
for Parky himself. I’ve erased him 
from my universe and suggest 
that you do likewise. He’s damned 
by his own I.Q. — leave him to na- 
ture.” 

Salomon grinned. “Okay, I’ll 
try.” 

« A ND now you go do whatever 

A it is you have to do and for- 
get that I tried to inveigle you into 
a pub crawl.” (Twin, you’re giving 
up too easily.) (Who is giving up?) 

“Eunice, if you really want 
to—” 

“No, no, Jake! Your heart’s 
not in it. While you are in Wash- 

172 



ington I may sample the flesh pots 
of this decadent village but I 
promise you that I will be closely 
guarded. Shorty, probably; he 
frightens people just with his size. 
Nor will I go alone; Alec told me 
that he and Mac didn’t have much 
trouble slipping the leash, and 
Winnie can make a fourth.” 
“Eunice.” 

“Yes, dear?” 

“I am like hell going to step 
aside for those two wolves.” 

“Why, Jake, you sound jeal- 
ous!” 

“No. God save me from falling 
prey to that masochistic vice. But 
if you want to see the seamy side 
of this ant hill. I’ll find out where 
the action is and take you there. 
Dress for it, girl — I’m going to 
shake the moths off my drinkin’ 
clothes. Formal, I mean.” 

“Bare breasts?” (Could you 
have done better. Pussy cat?) 
(Pick up the pup, twin. I concede.) 

“ ‘Much too good for the com- 
mon people.’ Unless you intend 
to paint heavily, plus a lot of that 
sparkly glitter stuff.” 

“I’ll try to do you proud, dear. 
But you will take a nap? Please.” 
“A long nap at once and a din- 
ner tray in my room. H-hour is 
twenty-two hundred. Be ready or 
we jump off without you.” 

“I’m scared. Want help to get 
to sleep? Me? Or Winnie? Or 
both?” 

“No, I’ve learned how to do it 
myself. Perfectly. Though I admit 
it’s more fun with two pretty little 
girls chanting with me. You get 
a nap. I may keep you up all 
night.” 

“Yes, sir.”

“And now, if I may be excused.” 
Mr. Salomon stood up, bent over 
her hand and kissed it. “Adios.” 
“Come back here and kiss me 
right!” 

He glanced over his shoulder. 
“Later, my dear. I don’t believe 
in letting women be notional.” He 
left. 

(Who won that round. Boss?) 
(He thinks he did, Eunice — and 
you tell me that’s how it ought to 
be.) (You’re learning, twin, you’re 
learning.) 

They had been lunching in her 
lounge. She went into her boudoir, 
sat down at her stenodesk to phone 
— picking it rather than the view- 
phone because its phone was not 
a viewphone. She used it with hush 
and with ear plugs. 

Shortly she was answered: “Dr. 
Garcia’s office.” 

“This is Mrs. McIntyre’s sec- 
retary. Is the Doctor in and, if so, 
can he spare a moment to speak 
to Mrs. McIntyre?” 

“Please hold. I will inquire.” 
Joan passed the time reciting 
her meditation prayer, was calm 
when he answered, “Dr. Garcia 
speaking.” 

“Mrs. McIntyre’s secretary. 
Doctor — hush and secure?” 

“Of course, Eunice.” 

“Roberto dear, do you have 
news for me?” 

“ ‘The Greeks have captured 
Athens.’ ” 

“Oh\ You’re certain?” 

“No possible doubt, Eunice. 
But don’t panic. You can have a 
D. and C. at once with no chance 
of your privacy being breached. 
I’ll get Dr. Kystra, the best possi- 
ble man and utterly trustworthy. 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



I’ll assist, there won’t even be a 
nurse present.” 

“Oh, Roberto, no, no, no! You 
don’t understand, dear — I’m going 
to have this baby if it’s the last 
thing I ever do. You’ve made me 
terribly happy.” (Now we’ve real- 
ly got something to celebrate. 
Boss, darling. But don’t tell Jake, 
huh?) (Nobody, just yet. How soon 
does our belly bulge?) (Not for 
weeks, if you don’t eat like a pig.) 
(1 want pickles and ice cream this 
instant.) (So don’t.) 

The Doctor answered slowly, 
“I misunderstood the situation. 
But you seemed quite nervous 
when I took the specimen.” 

“Certainly I was, dear; I was 
scared silly that I might not have 
caught.” 

“Uh . Eunice, I can’t help 
feeling personally responsible. I 
know you’re wealthy — but a mar- 
riage contract can exclude any 
‘fortune hunter’ possibility and — 
well. I’m available.” 

“Roberto, I think that’s the 
sweetest — and bluntest — proposal 
a knocked-up broad ever got. 
Thank you, dear; I do appreciate 
it. But, as you pointed out, I am 
wealthy — and I do not care what 
the neighbors think.” 

“Eunice, I am not simply ac- 
cepting my responsibility ... I 
want you to know that I do not 
regard marrying you as a chore.” 
“Roberto darling, it is not your 
responsibility. For all you know 
I’ve been sweetheart to the regi- 
ment.” (We’ve tried, haven’t we 
twin!) (Don’t joggle my elbow, 
dear; he wants to be noble.) “It’s 
my baby. Who helped me is my 
business.” 



173 




“Sorry.” 

“I meant that you mustn’t feel 
any responsibility. If you did help 
me, I’m grateful. I’m grateful even 
if you didn’t. Roberto? Instead of 
trying to make an honest woman 
out of me — difficult — why don’t 
you remove that implant from 
Winnie’s pretty thigh, then place 
another sort of implant where it 
will do the most good . then 
make an honest woman out of 
her. Much easier, she leans that 
way.” 

“It’s a thought. Truthfully it’s 
a thought I’ve considered quite a 
lot lately. But she doesn’t want to 
leave you.” 

“She need not. Oh, she could 
stop pretending to be my maid, 
but this is a big old barn, several 
spare suites. If you get her preg- 
nant, she and I could chum and 
giggle about it and have our ba- 
bies almost together. I’ll shut up 
and stop trying to run your life. 
Two questions — I had planned to 
go out on the town tomight, to 
celebrate the good news I expected 
to hear from you. Must I stick to 
soft drinks now?” 

“Not at all. Shortly we’ll put 
you on a diet and limit your drink- 
ing. But tonight you could get 
stinking drunk and the only effect 
would be a hangover. You don’t 
lose a baby that easily ... as 
millions of women have learned.” 

“May not get stinking but I 
may soak up several glasses of 
bubbly. Last question — If you’re 
able to sign off, would it suit you 
to lose a night’s sleep helping me 
celebrate? Officially it’s to cele- 
brate our court victory. That ‘the 
Greeks have captured Athens’ will 

174 



remain our secret a while longer.” 
“Uh— ” 

“You sound fretted, dear.” 
“Well, to tell the truth I have 
a date with Winnie.” 

“Oh! I expressed myself badly. 
I have a date with Jake; I hope 
that you and Winnie can make it 
a four. I wasn’t asking you to 
spend a night with me in that sense 
— although I certainly would not 
be averse if it could be managed 
some other time without hurting 
Winsome. The moments you and 
I have been able to steal have been 
too short, dear. I think you are 
a man it would be sweet to be lei- 
surely with.” 

“I know that you are such a 
woman, Eunice.” 

“Go along with you, you tell 
that to all your female patients. 
Doctor, you are a delightful wolf. 
Will you wait ten minutes before 
phoning Winnie? I have a favor I 
want to ask of her.” 

“Ten minutes.” 

“Thank you, Roberto. Off.” 

J OAN switched to the house in- 
tercom. “Winnie? Are you busy, 
dear?” 

“Just reading. Be right in.” 

Joan met her at their connecting 
door. “Nothing much, hon. I want 
you to call O’Neil and tell him 
that I wish to speak to Finchley. 
In my lounge. Sure, I could phone 
O’Neil myself, sweet, but I want 
it to look more formal.” 

“Sure, Joanie. Do I stay and 
chaperone?” 

“Winsome, you know darn well 
that all I ever want is fake chap- 
eronage — and sometimes a jigger. 
This time I don’t need a jigger — 

GALAXY 




but I do want to ask Finchley 
something privately and he will 
speak more freely if you aren’t 
around. So let him into my lounge, 
come tell me he has arrived and 
don’t come back in. Go on into 
your own room and close the 
door. Then stay there — you are 
going to receive a phone call in 
about eight minutes.” 

“I am?” 

“Yes, and a nice one. You and I 
and Jake and Dr. Garcia are going 
night-clubbing tonight.” 

“OA!” 

“And when we get home just 
keep him here the rest of the night 
and I’ll see to it that Jake doesn’t 
twig. Or does he know who ‘Bob’ 
is?” 

“Uh . yes, he does. I told 
him.” 

“It may still suit dear Doctor 
to cover up; men are shy. Now 
skedaddle, dear, and phone 
O’Neil.” 

Four minutes later Winnie an- 
nounced Finchley and left the 
lounge. He said, “You sent for 
me. Miss?” 

“Tom Cat, these doors are 
soundproof; you can stop being 
formal.” 

He relaxed a little. “Okay, Pus- 
sy Cat.” 

“So give us a kiss and sit down. 
That hall door locks itself. Winnie 
is the only one who could walk in 
and she won’t.” 

“Pussy Cat, sometimes you 
make me nervous.” 

“Oh, piffle.” She mover into 
his arms. “I do have a question to 
ask you — advice that I want. You 
can discuss it with O’Neil and get 
his advice, and any of the guards. 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



But it is your advice 1 want; the 
rest is coverup.” 

“Woman, quit talking and shove 
me some mouth.” 

Joan did so, a long thorough 
kiss. Presently he said hoarsely, 
“You don’t have much on under 
this.” 

“I don’t have anything on un- 
der it. But don’t get me distracted, 
Thomas Cattus; let me get my 
question in. I’m going nightclub- 
bing tonight — Jake and me, Win- 
nie and Dr. Garcia. They’re going 
to want to take us to cubes. I want 
to see rough places. I figure you 
know where they are.” 

“Mmm . Eunice, the up-high 
places are all in bad turf.” 

“Well, are they safe once we’re 
inside? And can one get inside 
safely?” 

“Uh . there’s one, has its 
own inside parking and as good 
armor as the doors you have. 
Look, I’ll bring up a list, addresses 
and so forth, and everybody’s sug- 
gestions. But I’ll star my own.” 
“Good. Thank you, Tom Cat.” 
“God, but you feel good. Do 
we have time? Can I lock that oth- 
er door?” 

“If I’m not worried about Win- 
nie, why should you be? Grab a 
pillow and put me on the floor.” 

T he party made rendezvous in 
Joan’s lounge. Jake Salomon 
had elected to dress with ultra old- 
fashioned formality: maroon tux- 
edo jacket and trousers, with white 
turtleneck. The silky knit made a 
splendid background for his gold 
ankh necklace. Dr. Garcia was 
just as formal in modern mode: 
scarlet tights boldly padded, 

175 



stretch-fit white mess jacket with 
jabot of pearls and black lace. Lit- 
tle Winifred wore her new emerald 
dress with floor-length skirt — no 
body paint as Joan had advised 
but blushes caused her skin to 
change again and again from ex- 
tremely fair to rosy glow. On her 
forehead in caste-mark position 
was a single emerald. 

Jake looked at her. “Little one, 
what holds that solitaire in place? 
Insurance?” 

She blushed again but answered 
saucily, “It’s on a corkscrew, sir. 
Shall I unscrew it and show you?” 
“No, I’m afraid you might be 
telling the truth.” 

“Never in mixed company, sir. 
Actually it’s the adhesive we use 
on bandages. Won’t come loose 
even with soap and water but al- 
cohol takes it right off.” 

“Then be careful not to spill 
your drinks that high.” 

“Oh, I don’t drink. Counselor; 
I learned my lesson long ago. I’ll 
be drinking Cuba Libre without 
the ‘libre’ and screwdrivers with no 
drive to them.” 

“Doctor, let’s leave her at home; 
she’s just a chaperone.” 

“Would you make me stay 
home. Counselor? Just for not 
drinking?” 

“Just for calling me ‘Counselor’ 
if you do it again. And for calling 
me ‘sir.’ Winifred, men my age do 
not care to be reminded of it by 
pretty little girls. After sundown 
my name is Jake.” 

“Yes, Counselor,’’ Winifred 
answered meekly. 

Jake sighed. “Doctor, some day 
I hope to win an argument with a 
woman.” 

176 



“If you do, tell Dr. Rosenthal. 
Rosy is writing a book on the dif- 
ference in mental processes be- 
tween male and female.” 

“A dreamer. Eunice does that 
thing cover you any better when 
you stand up? And what is it?” 

“It’s a hula skirt, Jake. And it 
does.” Joan Eunice was wearing 
a floor-length skirt, with her torso 
covered with a myriad glittering 
stars. They faded out gradually at 
neck and shoulders. The skirt was 
thousands of gold nylon threads 
overlying more thousands of deep 
blue threads. 

As she was seated, the mass of 
threads fell away from her grace- 
ful legs. Now she stood up; the 
threads fell back into a solid cur- 
tain. “See, Jake? A plain gold 
skirt. But when I move” — she 
walked — “the blue underneath 
keeps flashing through.” 

“Yes, and you, too. Panties?” 

“A rude question. The Polyne- 
sians never heard of pants until the 
missionaries corrupted them.” 
“That’s not a responsive an- 
swer — ” 

“Wasn’t meant to be.” 

“ — but as long as you are stand- 
ing, let’s get rolling.” 

“Yes, dear.” Joan Eunice put 
on a matching opaque yashmak, 
let Jake lay an evening cloak 
around her shoulders. Jake hooked 
on a maroon domino which cov- 
ered his distinctive aquiline nose — 
he had been too often on videb 
lately and felt that there was no 
point in concealing Miss J. S. B. 
Smith’s face if his own face broke 
her cover. The. Doctor donned a 
small white domino — having been 
asked to help keep the party in 

GALAXY 




character — and Winifred wore a 
filmy green harem veil that was 
only a symbol, being of the same 
material as her skirt. 

As they entered the lift Joan 
Eunice said, “Where are we going, 
Jake?” 

“Woman, you aren’t supposed 
to ask. The Gaslight Club, as a 
starter.” 

“It sounds like fun,” Joan 
agreed. “A piano player with 
sleeve garters and such?” 

“And derby hat and fake cigar 
— he can sing and play anything 
written a hundred years back. Or 
fake it.” 

I want to hear him. But, Jake, 
since this is to celebrate my uhuru, 
would you indulge me a little?” 
“Probably. Show your openers.” 
“There’s a club I’ve heard about 
. and while you were napping, I 
reserved a table for four for twen- 
ty-two thirty. I’d like to try it.” 
“Winnie, you haven’t been 
coaching her enough. Eunice, 
you’re not supposed to be capable 
of making such a decision— less 
than the dust beneath my chariot 
wheels and all that. All right, 
where is the dive? What’s its name? 
We’ll try the Gaslight later — there 
is a waitress there alleged to have 
the most pinchable bottom in the 
state.” 

“Probably foam rubber; Win- 
nie has that distinction. It’s the 
Pompeii-Now, Jake — I have the 
address in my purse.” 

Mr. Salomon’s eyebrows ap- 
peared over his domino. “We 
won’t need it, Eunice. That box 
is in an Abandoned Area.” 

“Does that matter? They have 
inside parking and assured me that 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



they are armored against anything 
short of a nuke bomb.” 

“We would still have to get 
there and back.” 

“Oh, I have confidence in Finch- 
ley and Shorty. Don’t you?” 
(Twin, that’s a crotch chop. Not 
nice.) (Big sister, do you want to 
go to the Gaslight and listen to bad 
piano and watch Jake pinch bot- 
toms? If so, say so.) (I just said 
it wasn’t nice.) (So you phrase the 
next answer. Jake’s a tough case.) 

“Joan Eunice, when I take a 
lady out for the evening, we go 
in my car. Not hers.” 

“Whatever you say, Jake; I was 
trying to be helpful. I asked Finch- 
ley and he said there was a route 
in that the — what do they call it? 
— the Organization — keeps open. 
No doubt Finchley can tell Rock- 
ford.” 

“7 call it the Mafia. If there is 
an acceptably safe route, Rock- 
ford knows it; he’s the most ex- 
pert driver in town — more experi- 
enced than your boys, he drives 
more.” 

“Jake, you don’t want to go 
there. So let’s go to the Gaslight. 
I want to try sticking a pin in that 
rubber fanny.” 

They went to the Pompeii-Now. 

T here was no trouble getting 
inside and the club had a card 
lounge for its patrons’ mobile 
guards. The maitre d’hotel led 
them to a ringside table across 
from the orchestra, swept a “Re- 
served” sign from it. “Will this be 
suitable, Mr. ‘Jones?’ ” 

“Yes, thank you,” agreed Sal- 
omon. Two silver-bucket stands 
with champagne appeared as they 

177 




sat down; the maitre-d’ took a 
magnum from the sommelier and 
displayed it to Salomon, who said, 
“That’s a poor year for Pol Rog- 
er. No Dom Perignon ’95?” 

“At once, sir.” The sommelier 
hurried away. The maitre d’hotel 
asked, “Is there anything else not 
to your liking, sir?” 

Joan Eunice leaned toward Jake. 
“Please tell him that I don’t like 
this chair. It was designed by Tor- 
quemada.” 

The floor manager looked up- 
set. “I’m sorry Madame feels 
that way about our chairs. They 
were supplied by the number-one 
hotel and restaurant supply com- 
pany.” 

“As may be,” Joan answered, 
“but if you think I’m going to 
spend an evening perched on a 
shooting stick and pretend that 
it’s fun, you are mistaken. Jake, 
we should have gone to the Gas- 
light.” 

“Perhaps, but we’re here now. 
Just a moment, dear. Matee 
D’hotel—” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“You have an office here, no 
doubt.” 

“Why, yes, sir.” 

“With a desk and a chair. Prob- 
ably a padded swivel chair with 
arms and an adjustable back. A 
man who is on his feet as much 
as you are wants a comfortable 
chair when he does sit down.” 

“I do have such a chair, sir, 
and — while it’s hardly suitable for 
dining room — Madame is welcome 
to it if it pleases her. I’ll send for 
it.” 

“One moment. In a club with 
so many activities — you have a 

178 



gaming room, do you not, and 
other things? — I feel sure that it 
is possible to round up four such 
chairs.” 

“I’ll try, sir. Although our oth- 
er patrons might find it odd if we 
supply one table with special 
chairs.” 

Mr. Salomon looked around. 
The place was less than half filled. 
“Oh, I imagine that if you ex- 
plained to anyone who asked just 
how expensive such special service 
is, he might not want it. Or you 
might find it possible to accommo- 
date him, too, if he is willing to 
pay. I think those guards pretend- 
ing to be waiters standing around 
the edge of the room can handle 
anyone who is unreasonable.” 

“All our staff are guards, sir — 
in a crunch. Very well, sir, if you 
will be patient a few moments 
your party will all have desk 
chairs.” Quickly he distributed 
wine cards and drug lists, and left. 

Roberto and Winifred were al- 
ready dancing. Joan leaned toward 
Jake again and said, “Jake, will 
you buy this place for me?” 

“Does it attract you that 
much?” 

“No, I want to make a bonfire 
out of these chairs. I had forgot- 
ten what indignities night clubs 
expect their customers to put up 
with.” 

“You’re spoiled.” 

“I intend to be. Jake, much of 
what is wrong with this world 
would be righted if the customer 
screamed every time he feels 
cheated. But I’m not out to re- 
form the world tonight; I simply 
want a comfortable chair. The 
cover charge — I checked it when I 

GALAXY 




made reservations for ‘Mr. Jones’ 
— is high enough to buy a decent 
chair. What are these ‘other activ- 
dies?” . A whorehouse upstairs, 
maybe?” 

“Eunice, see those three tables 
of beautiful people over in the cor- 
ner? Attractive men and women, 
all young, all smiles, no frowns, 
and each with a champagne glass 
that may hold ginger ale? It’s high 
odds that, if the Greeks had a 
word for it, they have a price for 
it.” 

“Why, one of those girls doesn’t 
look more than twelve.” 

“She may not be that old. 
Who’s going to check on her age, 
in an Abandoned Area? I thought 
you weren’t going to reform the 
world tonight, my dear?” 

“I’m not. If the government 
can’t police these areas, I certainly 
cannot. But I hate to see children 
exploited.” (Twin, that pretty child 
may have an I.Q. of 80 and no oth- 
er possible profession — she may 
think she’s lucky. Proud of her 
job. And seeing where she is, she’s 
either got an implant or cut tubes 
— not like that cheerleader I told 
you about.) (Eunice, doesn’t it 
bother you?) (Some, chum, but 
only some. People usually are 
what they are because it suits 
them — I learned that from Joe. 
The girl’s mother may be one of 
the other pretties there — two gets 
you seven. Want to rescue them 
both?) (Oh, shut up, darling; let’s 
have fun.) (Tm willing.) 

A waitress came past, refilled 
their glasses. She was pretty and 
was dressed in sandals, cosmetics 
and careful depilation. She smiled 
and moved on. “Jake, is she one?” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“Couldn’t say, I don’t know 
the house rules. Shocked, Eunice? 
I told you not to come here.” 
“Shocked at skirP. Jake dear, 
you forget that my generation 
thinks nothing of nudity.” 

“Hrrrmphl One more remark 
like that and I’ll call you Johann 
the rest of the evening.” 

“I’ll be good. Mostly. Darling, 
our waitress suddenly reminded 
me of the Chesterfield Club. Kan- 
sas City in the palmiest days of 
the Pendergast machine. Nineteen- 
thirty-four.” 

“In nineteen-thirty-four I was 
barely out of diapers, Eunice. It 
was something like this?” 

“Not as much fake swank and 
lower prices even allowing for in- 
flation. But otherwise much the 
same. It specialized in complete 
nudity even at high noon at the 
‘Businessman’s Lunch.’ Just up 
the street from the Federal Re- 
serve Bank. Jake, she’s headed 
back. Find out for me.” 

“How? I don’t even have a hat 
to tip.” 

“Simply ask her, dear, ask her 
if she’s available. Slip her ten dol- 
lars as you do.” 

The waitress came back, smiled, 
and said, “Have you looked over 
our drug list? All illegal drugs at 
the controlled international prices 
plus twenty-five percent. Guaran- 
teed pure, we obtain them from 
government sources.” 

“Not for me, thank you, dear. 
Eunice? Want a trip?” 

“Me? I don’t even take aspirin. 
But I want a steady supply of 
champagne. And I could use a 
sandwich, or something. Chiquita, 
is there a kitchen operative now?” 

179 




“There is always a gourmet chef 
on duty, Ma’am; it says so at the 
bottom of your wine card. Any- 
thing from snacks to Maine lob- 
ster. Would you like to see a 
menu?” 

“No, thank you. Maybe a big 
platter of little sandwiches for all 
of us, Jake. And don’t forget that 
other matter.” 

J OAN Eunice saw Jake get out 
a ten-dollar bill. It disappeared 
and Joan decided that the girl 
must have folded it with one hand 
and palmed it. Jake spoke to her 
in a voice lower than the music. 

She smiled and answered clear- 
ly. “No, sir. I’m not even allowed 
to dance with customers — and I’m 
not in that branch of the business; 
I’m married. But I can arrange 
it.” The waitress glanced toward 
the ‘beautiful people’ and looked 
back. “For you, sir? Or for both 
of you?” 

“No,” Jake answered. “It was 
just curiosity.” 

“My curiosity,” Joan put in. 
“I’m sorry, dear; I shouldn’t have 
made him ask you.” 

“Ma’am, a high roller can be as 
inquisitive as he wishes. Baby 
needs shoes.” She smiled. “Twins. 
Boys. Two years old. I was li- 
censed for two and now I’m argu- 
ing with the Board as to whether 
twins use up my license. Since 
twins are okay under a one-baby 
license. I’d like to have a little girl, 
too.” 

“Jake, be a high roller again; I 
want to ask” — Joan leaned for- 
ward, read the girl’s name written 
or tattooed above her left breast — 
“Marie another question.” 

180 



“He’s paid for more than one 
question, really. Ma’am.” But a 
second note disappeared as quick- 
ly as the first. 

“Marie, do you live inside the 
turf? With kids?” 

“Oh, goodness, no! My husband 
would never permit that. An armed 
bus picks me up after supper and 
delivers me home around breakfast 
time. Most of us use it. Except — ” 
She indicated the exception by in- 
clining her head toward the corner. 
“My husband is on night shift at 
Timken — we match up pretty 
well.” 

“Who takes care of your twins 
at night? Nursery?” 

“Oh, no. Mama lives with us. 
No huhu. Actually, Ma’am, this 
is a good job. I’ve been a waitress 
where I had to wear uniforms — 
and the work was hard and the tips 
were small. Here the work is easy 
and the tips are usually high. Oh, 
sometimes a customer gets drunk 
and gropy, but I don’t bruise all 
that easily — and drunks are often 
the highest tippers. Never any 
trouble; the guards watch every- 
thing.” She smiled at Joan. “You 
could get a job here in two sec- 
onds, Ma’am. All it takes is a 
friendly manner and a good figure 
— and you’ve got both.” 

“Thank you, Marie.” 

“I’d better go, the maltre-d’ is 
bringing a party to another of my 
tables. ’Scuse, please — sandwiches 
will be right in.” 

The girl left. Joan said, “Jake, 
would you say that she has found 
her niche?” 

“Seems so. As long as she keeps 
her figure and saves her money. 
She doesn’t pile up social security 

GALAXY 




points here; this doesn’t count as a 
job under the rules, it’s off the 
map.” 

“She doesn’t pay income tax?” 

“Oh, certainly! The fact that her 
income doesn’t exist, legally, 
means nothing to revenooers. 
Though she may hold out a good 
portion — I would. My dear, do 
you want to try this music?” 

“Jake, I thought you didn’t 
dance?” 

“I don’t dance this modern stuff. 
But I can try, if you want to. I 
wonder if that combo can play 
Rock? This new stuff has so little 
beat I don’t see why they call it 
dance music.” 

Joan chuckled. “I’m so much 
older that I despised Rock instead 
of liking it. Swinging was my era, 
Jake, and on back clear to the 
Bunny Hug — though I didn’t learn 
to dance until the foxtrot crowded 
out the rest.” 

“I can foxtrot. I’m not all that 
young. But I doubt if that bunch 
of disappointed harpists can play 
one. Eunice, can you tango?” 

“Try me, just try me! Learned 
it when Irene Castle was alive — 
and with this new body I’m eight 
times as good as I was then. Been 
teaching it to Winnie. Do you have 
a firm lead?” 

“Firm enough for you, wench. 
I’m going to flag the maltre-d’ — 
it’s possible that they can play one. 
It’s the only tempo that has stayed 
evergreen through all the passing 
fads.” 

“Of course, Jake. Because the 
tango, danced correctly, is so sexy 
that you ought to get married af- 
terwards. See if they can play 
one.” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



B ut they were interrupted by bus 
boys arriving with four swivel 
chairs and Joan decided that it 
would be polite to sit in hers a 
while, since she had made a fuss 
over chairs. Then sandwiches ar- 
rived and more champagne and she 
found she wanted both — bubbly, to 
make her tiddly and sandwiches to 
soak it up so that she wouldn’t get 
tiddly too fast. Roberto and Wini- 
fred returned to the table; Winnie 
said, “Oh, food! Goodbye, waist- 
line! Bob, will you love me when 
I’m fat?” 

“Who knows? Let’s operate and 
find out,” he answered, reaching 
for a sandwich with one hand and 
champagne with the other. 

“Winsome, pour that Coke into 
the wine bucket and have cham- 
pagne.” 

“Joanie, you know I mustn’t. 
My Nemesis.” 

“But this time there’s food to go 
with it . and not the other haz- 
ards.” 

Winifred blushed. “I’ll get 
drunk. I’ll get silly.” 

“Roberto, will you promise this 
poor child that, if she passes out, 
you’ll get her home safely?” 
(What’s safe about home, twin? 
You ought to hang out a red 
light.) (Nonsense, Eunice! Our 
man won’t marry us — so what do 
you want me to do'] I don’t give 
myself to men I don’t respect — and 
I’ve got years to make up for. I’m 
nearly ninety-five years old — and 
knocked up — and healthy — and 
can’t hurt anyone physically and 
won’t hurt anyone socially ... a 
man’s pride or anything else. Why 
shouldn’t I be ‘No-Pants Smith’?) 
(‘Methinks the lady doth protest 

181 




too much.’ Boss, your Bible-Belt 
background is chafing you again. 
Certainly sex is no sin — but you 
don’t really believe it.) (I do so! 
Always have. I’ve been almost 
enough of a busybody to keep you 
happy. Why do you needle me?) 
(Beloved Boss. You’ve shown 
amazing talent for juggling eggs 
and I’ve enjoyed every second of it 
and I hope you have, too.) (You 
know I have. So much I’m scared 
of losing my judgment. My cau- 
tion, rather. Eunice, I never 
dreamed how much more it is, to 
be a woman. It’s our whole body.) 

The cabaret was crowded now; 
the lights changed and the floor 
show began — two comics. Joan 
listened, tried to look amused, and 
tried to amuse herself by trying to 
remember how long ago she had 
heard each “new” gag. She could 
see only one improvement in the 
routines: The “dirty” story of her 
(his) youth had disappeared. Being 
based on shock of breaking taboo, 
the dirty story had bled to death 
when there were no more taboos. 
There was sex humor — the comics 
used plenty of it; sex remained for- 
ever the most comical thing on a 
weary globe. But it was harder to 
work out real comedy than it once 
had been simply to shock. 

But she applauded the comics as 
they left. There was a blackout and 
the dance floor changed instantly 
into a farmyard scene — and she 
found herself more intrigued by 
trying to guess the mechanics of 
that “magic” than she had been by 
the comics. 

The farmyard set was used for 
one of the oldest (possibly the old- 
est, she decided) of all sex stories, 

182 



and it was done in stylized, very 
old symbols in both costume and 
props: The Farmer, the Farmer’s 
Daughter, and the City Slicker 
with his Hundred-Dollar Bills. It 
was pantomine, with theme music 
from the orchestra. 

She whispered to Jake, “If she’s 
a farm girl. I’m Adolf Hitler.” 

“What do you know about 
farms, my dear?” 

“Plenty, for a city boy. On one 
nearly every summer when I was a 
kid. Followed the harvest in high 
school and college — good money, 
plus occasionally a farm girl. Al- 
ways was a peasant at heart — 
wanted the biggest manure pile in 
the valley . and got it, save that 
it was cash. Jake? Couldn’t we buy 
an abandoned farm? A simple little 
place, with drawbridge and moat, 
and our own power plant and wa- 
ter supply? Get out of this dying 
city?” 

“If you say to, dear. Getting 
bored with this? Want to move 
on?” 

“Not during their act, dear.” 
(Tm curious to see how he fakes 
it.) (Me, too!) 

To her surprise the entertainers 
did not fake it. Money caused the 
“farm girl” to go from offended, 
to coy, to consent, to active coop- 
eration, with a hay stack as locale 
of consummation — and actor and 
actress made certain that the audi- 
ence could see that it was in no 
way faked. Winifred blushed to her 
waist and never took her eyes off 
it. 

The ending had a variation that 
Joan- Johann conceded was new to 
her-him. As motions grew vigor- 
ous and the orchestra kept time to 

GALAXY 




loud squeals and grunts, the 
“Farmer” showed up (as expected) 
with pitchfork. But the hay caught 
fire, apparently from the action, 
and the “Farmer” dropped his 
pitchfork and grabbed a seltzer 
bottle conveniently at hand on an 
empty table and doused his 
“Daughter” and the “City Slick- 
er” in putting out the fire — aiming 
first at the apparent source of the 
fire. 

Joan decided that it rated ap- 
plause. Winifred hesitantly joined 
in, then clapped hard when Rober- 
to did. Jake joined in but was in- 
terrupted. “What is it, Rockford?” 



J OAN turned her head, surprised. 

Jake’s driver-guard was looking 
very upset. “Mr. Salomon — Fve 
got to speak with you.” 

“You are. Speak up.” 

“Uh — ” Rockford tried to 
make it just to his employer but 
Joan watched his lips. That crazy 
fool Charlie has gone got hisself 
killed.” 

“Oh, for God’s sake! Where? 
How?” 

“Just now. In the guards’ 
lounge. Not drunk. This is a tight 
joint, they won’t let a guard drink. 
We were playing stud and Charlie 
kept needling this Polack. No ex- 
cuse and I told him to knock it off. 
But he didn’t. Polack got sore, but 
tried to avoid a showdown. Charlie 
kept crowding him and — oh, 
what’s the use; the Polack broke 
his neck. Before I could get 
around to that side of the table.” 
Rockford said, “Boss? Seeing 
where we are, I could dump him. 
Best, maybe?” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“Of course not. I have to report 
it, the body has to go to the 
morgue. Damn it. Rocky, I’m his 
parole officer.” 

“Yeah, but maybe you don’t 
know about it? He skipped. 
Dropped out.” 

“Shut up.” Salomon turned to 
Joan. “My dear. I’m terribly sor- 
ry-” 

“Jake, I should never have asked 
you to take me into an A. A.” 

“That has nothing to do with it. 
Charlie was a congenital killer. 
Rockford, get the ma1tre-d’. No, 
take me to the manager. Friends — 
Bob, Winnie---stay here please. 
I’ve got to take care of some- 
thing.” 

Garcia said, “I caught most of 
it. Take me with you, Jake. I can 
certify death — and it’s smart to get 
that done at once.” 

“Uh . who’s going to stay 
with the girls?” 

Joan put her hand on Jake’s 
arm. “Jake, Winnie and I are safe 
— lots of guards. I think we’ll go 
to the powder room. I need to, 
Winnie probably does, too. Com- 
ing, Winnie?” 



T he party was over but it was 
two hours before they were 
home; too many details — tedious 
ones rather than legal complica- 
tions, as Dr. Garcia certified 
death, and he, the manager, Mr. 
Salomon, and Rockford endorsed 
the certificate that death had oc- 
curred in an Abandoned Area at 
the hands of a party or parties un- 
known — in fact unknown, as the 
cardroom was empty save for the 
body. There was no point in inquir- 

183 




■ 







ies; it had happened in an A ban 
doned Area and was not a crime 
de facto nor in any practical sense 
de jure. Nor did anyone weep; even 
Rockford did not like his driving 
partner, he simply respected him 
as a fast gun in a crunch. To Gar- 
cia Jake groused that he should 
have known better than to try to 
rehabilitate a congenital — and got 
no sympathy, as Garcia believed 
that such creatures should be ex- 
terminated as soon as identified. 

Both tried to keep the grisly as- 
pects from the ladies. 

Winifred and Joan Eunice spent 
an hour alone at the table, fiddling 
with champagne and trying to look 
amused, while the men tidied up 



the mess. But Joan helped'on one 
to be sent to 
the morgue and Jake was unwilling 
to leave it to the management, he 
was certain they would dump it. 
Nor was he willing to send Rock- 
ford without someone to ride shot- 
gun. So a phone was brought to 
Joan and she called O’Neil — was 
answered instantly and wondered if 
her Chief ever slept. 

Finchley and Shorty were on du- 
ty; O’Neil said they would be roll- 
ing at once. But Joan ordered him 
to have them first pick up Fred, to 
ride shotgun for Rockford. As an 
afterthought she told O’Neil to 
have the night pantryman place a 
cold supper and a case of chilled 



184 







champagne in her lounge — the 
“night on the town” had turned 
out a dismal flop; she was darned 
if she would let it stay that way. 
Charlie was better dead and his 
death did not rate one crocodile 
tear. Ten thousand human beings 
had died around the globe in the 
hour since his death — why weep 
over a worthless one? (Eunice, 
what happens to a kark like Char- 
lie after he’s dead?) (I’m no au- 
thority, Boss. Maybe the bad ones 
die dead — like a potter destroying 
damaged work.) 

(I don’t know its wavelength, 
sweetheart. Maybe you can tell me 
this — How can I get this party 
rolling again? Look at Winnie — 



drinking champagne but not smi- 
ling.) (Boss darling, I recommend 
more champagne and Money 
Hums, mixed fifty-fifty.) (Eunice, 
I thought you didn’t approve of 
liquor?) (Never said that. Boss. I 
didn’t drink because I didn’t need 
it. But nothing is good or bad in it- 
self, just in its effects. Try it. Can’t 
hurt, might help.) 

So when at last the four reached 
the big, ugly fortress, Eunice in- 
sisted that they go to her lounge 
for a nightcap and a snack. “Who 
knows? We might feel like dancing 
yet. Roberto, has Winnie intro- 
duced you to our relaxing routine? 
The Money Hum?” 

“I’ve tried to teach it to him.

Joanie. But Bob is a dreadful cyn-

“Jake, let’s uncynic Roberto. 
I’ve thought of a new way to recite 
it. Sit in a circle and pass around a 
loving cup. Three recite while one 
drinks, and pass the cup to the next 
one.” 

“I vote Yea,” Jake answered. 
“Doctor, if you want to be cynical, 
go do so by yourself — you can 
have the guest bed in my suite. 
We’ll form a triangle instead.” 

“I had better stay to keep the 
party orderly.” 

“Very well, sir. But one unseem- 
ly word while we are at our devo- 
tions and you will be severely pun- 
ished.” 

“How?” 

Joan Eunice answered, “By hav- 
ing to down the loving cup unas- 
sisted, of course, and then start it 
again.” 

J OAN EUNICE woke up feeling 
rested but very thirsty. She 
glanced at the ceiling, saw that it 
was after ten and thought idly of 
turning on floor lights as a gentle 
preliminary to stronger light. 

Then she realized that she was 
not alone. Should she wake Jake — 
gently — for a pleasant good morn- 
ing? Or slide out softly and sneak 
back to her room and hope not to 
be seen? Or did it matter? Was she 
already a topic of gossip in her 
own house? 

Better not wake Jake in any 
case; the poor darling planned to 
go to Washington tonight. She 
started to slide out of bed. 

The man beside her reached out 
and pulled her to him. She at once 
gave in, went soft and boneless. 



“Didn’t know you were awake, 
dear. I meant to — Robertol” 

“You were expecting Santa 
Claus?” 

“How did you get here?” 

“You invited me.” 

“I did? Well, yes, I did. I mean 
I told you that you were welcome 
in my bed, quite a while back. But 
where’s Jake? Did he go to sleep 
on us? And what about Winnie?” 
She thumbed on the floor lights, 
saw that she was, as she was begin- 
ning to suspect, in her own bed. 

“Winnie’s next door. In her bed. 
With Jake.” 

“Good God, Roberto — I’ve fi- 
nally spent a night with you. And 
don’t remember it.” (/ do! Wheel) 
(Well, I don’t, Eunice. Not in de- 
tail. Confused.) (You’re a drunken 
little bitch. Boss. But we had fun.) 
(I’m sure we did. I wish I remem- 
bered it.) 

Dr. Garcia sighed. “Ah, well. I 
should not complain.” 

“It’s coming back to me,” she 
lied. “Just disoriented as I woke 
up. You were especially sweet to 
me. 

“You didn’t think so when I 
wouldn’t let you go to bed with 
your makeup on.” 

Joan allowed enough general il- 
lumination to come on to let her 
see herself, noted that the star se- 
quins were gone as well as body 
paint they had adhered to. She had 
not scrubbed it off herself; ergo, 
someone else had. Not Winnie — 
Winnie had been potted as a palm. 
“That’s part of what I meant by 
‘especially sweet,’ Roberto. Not 
many men would take such good 
care of a drunken wench. Was I 
hard to handle?”

“Not really. But you were 
pretty tight.” 

“Too tight?” 

“Not too tight. Just pleasantly 
so.” 

“I’m not sure I understand that 
and don’t think I want to. Roberto 
darling, even if I did fuss over it, 
thank you for washing me. Only a 
slut leaves paint on when she goes 
to bed. I’m a tart but I don’t want 
to be a slut.” (Hi, slut!) “And 
thank you most of all for a won- 
derfully sweet night. I hope I 
wasn’t too drunk.” 

“Eunice, you would be more 
woman passed out cold than most 
can manage at their best.” 

“I’m glad you said ‘would be’ 
rather than ‘are.’ But, Roberto, 
I’m uneasy. Not about you and 
me, dear, but about Winnie. Does 
this affect that thought you’ve 
been considering? About Winnie, I 
mean.” 

“On the contrary, Eunice, it was 
Winnie’s idea — her notion of how 
to celebrate our engagement — ” 
“Wait a moment! Am / engaged 
to youT’ 

“Eh? No, no — I’m engaged to 
Winnie.” 

“Oh. Roberto, I would happily 
marry you, you would make a nu- 
mero-uno esposo. But I don’t need 
one, and Winnie does. Did I know 
this last night? About you two?” 
“You seemed to. You said that 
was why you wouldn’t wait to 
scrub off your sparklers — you 
were right-now about it.” 

“Roz. 1 remember being terribly 
eager but I seem to have drawn a 
blank as to why. Roberto? Did I 
spill the news about the ‘Greeks 
capturing Athens?’ ” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“I don’t think so, Eunice. Not 
when I was around. I’m fairly sure 
Winnie doesn’t know it.” 

“I’ll tell Winnie; it’s Jake I want 
to keep in the dark.” 

“Eunice? Did Jake do it? Cap- 
ture Athens and the Parthenon as 
well.” 

“Watch that Hippocratic Oath, 
dear. Parthenogenesis might be the 
answer. Let me keep this up in the 
air a while longer. You say this 
was Winnie's idea? After you told 
her you would marry her?” 

“Yes.” 

“How did she ever get up the 
courage to propose? I’ve been urg- 
ing her to — but she’s so damn’ shy. 
Dutch courage?” 

“Yes. But my own. Sure, she’s 
shy — but under her blushes Winnie 
is as rugged as a nurse has to be. 
She said All right — if I would let 
her tie it down tight that she is no 
angel. I told her I had no use for 
angels, in bed or out. She said she 
hoped I meant that, because she 
was about to ask Jake to sleep 
with her.” 

“Roberto, I missed a lot of this. 
How 'much champagne did I 
drink?” 

“Who counts? Jake kept open- 
ing bottles and we kept passing the 
loving cup around. While reciting 
that amphigory. You got your 
share. We all did.” 

“Uh . am I engaged to Jake?” 
“Not that I know of.” 

“That’s good. Because when 
Jake finds out I’m knocked up, 
he’s going to be noble. Just as you 
were, dear, but Jake will be much 
more difficult. And I’ve discovered 
that I don’t need a husband; I just 
want loving friends. You. Jake. 

187 




Winnie. Some others. People 
who’ll love me as 1 am, clay feet 
and all — not because of a contract. 
Did Jake make any fuss over the 
sleeping arrangements?” 

“Uh, truthfully 1 don’t think 
anyone was displeased with Win- 
nie’s suggestion. Jake picked Win- 
nie up under one arm and an- 
nounced that he was reenacting the 
Rape of the Sabines.” 

“The faithless old darling.” 

“So I picked you up and carried 
you in and scrubbed you . and 
you squealed and protested and 
tdld me that was a hell of a way to 
run a rape.” 

“Mmm, I think I was right. ‘In 
vino veritas.’ ” 

“So now I’m going to put a pil- 
low over your face so that you 
can’t squeal and protest.” 

“You won’t need a pillow; just 
put your hand over my mouth if 
I’m noisy. But all these doors are 
soundproof.” 

“You think I don’t know it? 
When I lived here for most of a 
year? Miss Johann Smith, 1 know 
more about your house than you 
do.” 

“Oh, you bastard! Call me ‘Eu- 
nice.’ Or put a pillow over my face 
so 1 can’t hear you. I love you, 
Roberto — I’m so happy that 
you’re going to marry our Win- 
some.” 

“So am I, Eunice. Now shut 
up.” 

“Yes, sir.” {Unh\ Eunice, no- 
body ever tells me anything.) (Shut 
up, twin, and pay attention to what 
you’re doing!) 

J OAN EUNICE reached over for 
the intercom beside her bed, 
tapped it for Cunningham, then 

188 



reached for Roberto’s hand. 

“Yes, Miss?” 

“Cunningham, I want breakfast 
for four, served in my lounge.” 
“Yes, Miss.” 

“Placed in my lounge, rather, 
with warmers and coolers. No ser- 
vice. I have no idea when Mr. Sal- 
omon and Dr. Garcia will wake 
up, but I want to be hostessish and 
ready to serve them myself when 
they do. But Winnie and I want to 
eat.” She winked at the doctor. 
“Certainly, Miss.” 

“They need their sleep. Tell me, 
Cunningham — you’ve known me a 
long time. Have you ever pinned 
one on?” 

“Pardon me. Miss?” 

“Go on a luau, get so fried you 
can’t find the floor with both feet. 
Drunk and disorderly.” 

“I have sometimes — in the past 
— come down with that ailment.” 
“Then you know what a delicate 
condition we are in — Winnie and 
myself at least and I have reason 
to believe that the gentlemen will 
not be in much better shape. But 
there was excellent excuse.” 

“I heard about the trouble. 
Miss. Too bad.” 

“Cunningham, I did not mean 
Charlie. This may be callous of 
me . but he was a bully who 
picked a fight and lost.” 

“Oh. If I may say so. Miss, he 
was not liked below stairs. Uh, we 
really did not like having him in 
the house.” 

“I know. I would have put a 
stop to it tong ago except that he 
worked for Mr. Salomon, not me 
— and I owe Mr. Salomon a great 
deal. No, the ‘excellent excuse’ 
was something else. We were cele- 

GALAXY 




brating an engagement.” 

Cunningham said cautiously, 
“Should I offer congratulations, 
Miss?” 

“Yes, but not to me. Dr. Garcia 
is marrying Winifred.” 

“Oh! That’s fine. Miss. But we’ll 
miss her.” 

“I am hoping that we will not 
have to miss her. This is a big 
house, Cunningham, much too 
large for one person. Or for two 
whenever Mr. Salomon can be per- 
suaded to honor us. Not often 
enough, that is to say — but the 
Counselor is afraid that he will 
cause gossip about me.” 

“Uh, may I speak plainly. 
Miss?” 

“Any time you don’t, Cunning- 
ham, I shall be offended.” 

“Mr. Salomon is a fine gentle- 
man. But if he worries about that 
— well, it’s silly, that’s all I can 
say. The staff do not gossip about 
his presence. They respect him.” 
“Perhaps you can tell him, he 
won’t listen to me. But today I’m 
simply concerned that he sleep as 
late as possible. He must go to 
Washington tonight, you know. 
When you bring up breakfast, 
don’t go past his door; go around 
the other way. You can’t disturb 
me or Winnie; we are awake. And 
be certain that Hubert doesn’t 
come fussing around until Mr. 
Salomon sends for him.” 

“He won’t. Miss; he never 
does.” 

“He used to, sometimes, when 
he was tending me — be a touch 
noisy when he thought I should be 
up. So keep him off this floor. 
Keep everyone off this floor until 
I call you — that includes all clean- 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



ing, everything. Except, of course, 
that I want you to bring up break- 
fast — with whatever help you need 
— promptly.” 

“Yes, Miss. Perhaps coffee and 
juice at once?” 

“No, we don’t want to be dis- 
turbed twice; my ears might fall 
off. You’ll find evidence of the 
debacle in my lounge — a case lot 
of empty magnums. Remove them 
— quietly — for Heaven’s sake 
don’t bang one against another; I 
can hear an ant stomp this morn- 
ing. Pencil ready? We need a sim- 
ple, nourishing breakfast. At least 
four cups of coffee each, double 
oders of orange juice, half grape- 
fruits, either pinks or the big Ari- 
zonas, scrambled eggs, poached 
eggs, some link sausages and 
breakfast steaks. Better include 
cold cuts and sliced cheeses. Oh, 
toast and muffins and jam and 
such. Flatbread. And a big pitcher 
of ice cold milk for cereal, I think 
this is a cereal morning. Some de- 
cent, quiet, well-brought-up cereal 
that doesn’t snap, crackle, or pop. 
That’s all. Unless you know a 
remedy for a hangover.” 

“Well, Miss, when I was tending 
Mr. Armbrust before I went to 
work for you, I used to mix some- 
thing that he thought welt of.” 
“Yes?” 

“Silver fizz. Miss, using vodka 
rather than gin.” 

“Cunningham, you’re a genius. 
One each, plus largish dividends, in 
thermos glasses. How soon will 
breakfast be ready?” 

“Can’t be sooner than twenty 
minutes. Miss, even though Della 
has started the sausages. But I 
could still fetch up coffee and 

189 




juice.” 

“One trip only. Then steal quiet- 
ly away on stocking feet. This is a 
hospital zone, Cunningham. Win- 
nie and I need at least twenty min- 
utes to put our eyeballs back in, 
they’re bleeding. I’ll expect you 
not sooner than twenty minutes, 
not later than twenty-five. Off.” 

She put down the bedside inter- 
com, said, “Doctor, did I handle 
that?” 

“Eunice, sometimes I think 
you’re not truthful.” 

“And some time I’m going to 
be a hermit and not have to dodge 
servants. Where are your clothes, 
Roberto? In the lounge?” 

“Yes. I had better get into 
them.” 

“Better think again. We’ve got 
twenty minutes of privacy, we’ll 
use it.” 

“Oh, Eunice!” 

“Courage, comrade; Tm not a 
black widow spider. We’ll use it to 
gather up all clothes in the lounge, 
toss feminine items in here, fast — 
then take your clothes and Jake’s 
down to his suite — where I’ll grab 
a robe and pajamas and slippers 
for Jake, and a second set of his 



for you. If you’re a sissy, you’ll 
stay there and put them on. If 
you’re not, you’ll stay in skin and 
come back here with me and dress 
when you feel like it. Then I’ll 
switch on a light that tells Winnie 
I’m awake — better than phoning 
the love bugs, they might be love- 
bugging, and even a bug hates to 
be disturbed at such times. Come 
on, you bony, hairy, wonderful 
man. Sixteen minutes — we can do it 
in twelve. I’ll bet.” 

“Pussy Cat, sometimes you 
make me nervous.” 

“Oh, piffle, I own this house. 
Although 1 may sell it and buy a 
nudist resort in California — then 
run it just for me and my friends. 
Roberto, I like skin — when it’s the 
wonderful skin I have now. It’s 
meant to be seen and touched — 
not hidden away in clothes. Did 
you like our waitress last night?” 

“A healthy young woman.” 

“Oh, piffle twice. I’ll bet you 
were thinking about her when you 
took me to bed last night. I know 
men, darling — I was one, much 
longer than you’ve been alive. Fif- 
teen minutes. Let’s move.”
