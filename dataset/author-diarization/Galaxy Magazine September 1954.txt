QWERTYUIOP 



f ■''HE title of this piece should 
be more familiar than “etaoin 
shrdlu.” For some typically hu- 
man reasdn, it isn’t, even though 
you may never have seen a Lino- 
type machine and probably own 
a thing that goes “qwertyuiop.” 

The item, of course, is the 
typewriter. Its biography has 
been written by Bruce Bliven, 
Jr., entitled The Wonderful Writ- 
ing Machine and published by 
Random House. And about time, 
too — I’ve been beating typewrit- 
ers for a quarter of a century and 
never once guessed the astonish- 
ing history of this unobtrusive 
and yet revolutionary invention. 

How astonishing can the type- 
writer be? Well, on the dust jacket 
of the book is a quiz. I won’t try 
to answer all the questions, be- 
cause you’ll undoubtedly want 
to find them yourself. 

1. What well-known author 
has devised a successful Chinese 
typewriter? 

2. What is the volume of busi- 
ness done annually in the United 
States in typewriter ribbons and 
carbons: $50,000; $500,000; $50,- 
000 , 000 ? 

3. In what year did an Eng- 
lish engineer think up the basic 
idea of a typewriter: 1714; 1832; 
1888? 

I can’t pass up this bit of 



shocking news. It was on Janu- 
ary 7, 1714, that Queen Anne 
granted an English engineer, 
Henry Mill, a Royall Letters Pa- 
tent with exclusive rights for the 
next fourteen years to “an arti- 
ficial machine or method for the 
impressing or transcribing of let- 
ters singly or progressively one 
after another, as in writing . .” 

Whether Mill actually built 
the machine is not known. In any 
case, the Russians can’t claim 
the invention — the first Russian 
typewriter was made by Jaan 
Jaackson in Riga about 1840, 
while the first American machine 
was invented by William Austin 
Burt in 1828. 

But it is the fifty-second in- 
ventor of the typewriter, Chris- 
topher Latham Sholes of Mil- 
waukee, who is called the father 
of the typewriter, for his device 
laid down most of the basic prin- 
ciples of the modern one. 

4. What is the origin of the 
popular phrase, “Now is the time 
for all good men to come to the 
aid of their party”? Believe it or 
not, that was the campaign slo- 
gan of Ulysses S. Grant! 

5. Why did the first typewrit- 
ers sold look somewhat like sew- 
ing machines? 'The answer is 
simple — they were manufactured 
in a sewing machine factory. The 



4 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



foot treadle was used to haul 
the typewriter carriage back to 
starting position. 

6. Who was the first author to 
turn in to his his publisher a 
typewritten book manuscript? 
I’m glad it was Mark Twain; I’d 
hate to have the honor go to one 
of the literary slobberers who in- 
fested that period. 

7. How many schools teach 
typing in the United States to- 
day: 2,300; 23,000; 230,000? 

8. How much does it cost to 
produce the average business let- 
ter? A dismaying 80c to $1.30 — 
enough to stab a businessman 
right in the wallet. 

9. Why is the keyboard ar- 
rangement of all typewriters 
hopelessly inefficient? 

The damned thing just hap- 
pened, with the result that some- 
thing like 63% of the work is 
done by the left hand. Keyboards 
based on letter frequency have 
been devised, but “qwertyuiop” 
looks as if it’s here to stay; the 
job of retraining several million 
typists is just too big — and get- 
ting bigger every year. Yet a more 
efficient keyboard can boost 
speed and accuracy 25% or more! 

13. Is there any advantage to 
having a silk typewriter ribbon 
instead of one made of cotton? 
Bliven says yes. I say no — silk 
costs too much, prints too faint- 
ly and you hate to throw it out 
even long after you should. 



15. How many typewriters are 
used on a United States battle- 
ship: 5; 55; 550? Naval orders 
call for 55 machines, but I find 
that less intoxicating than' this 
information — in the Army, dur- 
ing combat, there are more type- 
writers within four thousand 
yards of the front lines than 
medium and light artillery pieces 
combined! 

The rest of the book contains 
equally startling data that I’m 
sure you’ll want to read. But for 
us in science fiction, the type- 
writer is another proof that the 
really vast societal changes are 
brought about by seemingly un- 
important things. 

The suffragettes fought heroic- 
ally and uselessly for equality of 
the sexes — never realizing that 
the typewriter had ended the 
battle. It brought women out of 
the home, made them economic- 
ally independent. The franchise 
was only a political recognition 
of an evolutionary fact that had 
come about almost unnoticed. 

Much more than today’s inter- 
national strife, or atomic power, 
or perhaps rocketry, there are in- 
significant-looking gadgets in the 
lab or even in common use that 
will shape the future. What are 
they? You’ll find many of the 
answers in science fiction. You 
might have one in your hand 
right now!

The man who 



By F. L. WALLACE 



There is nothing at all like having a sound 



mind in a sound body, but Dan Merrol had too 



much of one— and also too much of the otherl 






ORRY, darling,” said 
Erica. She yawned, 
' added, “I’ve tried — but 
I just can’t believe you’re my 
husband.” 

He felt his own yawn slip off 
his face. “What do you mean? 
What am I doing here then?”

“Can’t you remember?” Her 
laughter tinkled as she pushed 
him away and sat up. “They said 
you were Dan Merrol at the hos- 
pital, but they must have been 
wrong.” 

“Hospitals don’t make that 
kind of mistake,” he said with 
a certainty he didn’t altogether 
feel. 

“But / should know, shouldn’t 
I?” 

“Of course, but . .” He did 
some verbal backstepping. “It 
was a bad accident. You’ve got 
to expect that I won’t be quite 
the same at first.” He sat up. 
“Look at me. Can’t you tell 
who I am?” She returned his 
gaze, then swayed toward him. 
He decided that she was highly 
attractive — but surely he ought 
to have known that long ago. 

W ITH a visible effort she 
leaned away from him. 
“Your left eye does look fam- 
iliar,” she said cautiously. “The 
brown one, I mean.” 

“The brown one?” 

“Your other eye’s green,” she 
told him. 

“Of course — a replacement. I 
told you it was a serious accident. 
They had to use whatever was 
handy.” 

“I suppose so — but shouldn’t 
they have tried to stick to the 
original color scheme?” 

“It’s a little thing,” he said. 



“I’m lucky to be alive.” He took 
her hand. “I believe I can con- 
vince you I’m me.” 

“I wish you could.” Her voice 
was low and sad and he couldn’t 
guess why. 

“My name is Dan Merrol.” 

“They told you that at the 
hospital.” 

They hadn’t — he’d read it on 
the chart. But he had been alone 
in the room and the name had 
to be his, and anyway he felt 
like Dan Merrol. “Youi^name is 
Erica.” 

“They told you that too.” 

She was wrong again, but it 
was probably wiser not to tell 
her how he knew. No one had 
said anything to him in the hos- 
pital. He hadn’t given them a 
chance. He had awakened in a 
room and hadn’t wanted to be 
alone. He’d got up and read the 
chart and searched dizzily 
through the closet. Clothes were 
hanging there and he’d put them 
on and muttered her name to 
himself. He’d sat down to gain 
strength and after a while he’d 
walked out and no one had stop- 
ped him. 

It was night when he left the 
hospital and the next thing he 
remembered was her face as he 
looked through the door. Her 
name hadn’t been on the chart 
nor her address and yet he had 
found her. That proved some- 
thing, didn’t it? “How could I 



8 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



forget you?” he demanded. 

“You may have known some- 
one else with that name. When 
were we married?” 

Maybe he should have stayed 
in the hospital. It would have 
been easier to convince her there. 
But he’d been frantic to get 
home. “It was quite a smashup,” 
he said. “You’ll have to expect 
some lapses.” 

“I’m making allowances. But 
can’t you tell me something 
about myself?” 

He thought — and couldn’t. He 
wasn’t doing so well. “Another 
lapse,” he said gloomily and 
then brightened. “But I can tell 
you lots about myself. For in- 
stance, I’m a specialist in lepi- 
doptera.” 

“What’s that?” 

“At the moment, who knows? 
Anyway, I’m a well-known actor 
and a musician and a first-rate 
mathematician. I can’t remember 
any equations offhand except C 
equals pi R squared. It has to 
do with the velocity of light. And 
the rest of the stuff will come 
back in time.” It was easier now 
that he’d started and he went on 
rapidly. “I’m thirty-three and 
after making a lot of money 
wrestling, married six girls, not 
necessarily in this order — Lucille, 
Louise, Carolyn, Katherine, Shir- 
ley and Miriam.” That was quite 
a few marriages — maybe it was 
thoughtless of him to have men- 



tioned them. No woman approves 
her predecessors. 

“That’s six. Where do I come 
in?” 

“Erica. You’re the seventh and 
best.” It was just too many, 
now that he thought of it, and 
it didn’t seem right. 

She sighed and drew away. 
“That was a lucky guess on your 
age.” 

D ID that mean he wasn’t right 
on anything else? From the 
expression on her face, it did. 
“You’ve got to expect me to be 
confused in the beginning. Can’t 
you really tell who I am?” 

“I can’t! You don’t have the 
same personality at all.” She 
glanced at her arm. There was 
a bruise on it. 

“Did I do that?” he asked. 
“You did, though I’m sure you 
didn’t mean to. I don’t think you 
realized how strong you were. 
Dan was always too gentle — he 
must have been afraid of me. 
And you weren’t at all.” 

“Maybe I was impetuous,” he 
said. “But it was such a long 
time.” 

“Almost three months. But 
most of that time you were float- 
ing in gelatin in the regrowth 
tank, unconscious until yester- 
day.” She leaned forward and 
caressed his cheek. “Everything 
seems wrong, no matter how hard 
I try to believe otherwise. You 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX

don’t have the same personality 
— you can’t remember anything.” 

“And I have one brown eye 
and one green.” 

“It’s not just that, darling. Go 
over to the mirror.” 

He had been seriously injured 
and he was still weak from the 
shock. He got up and walked 
unsteadily to the mirror. “Now 
what?” 

“Stand beside it. Do you see 
the line?” Erica pointed to the 
glass. 

He did — it was a mark level 
with his chin. “What does it 
mean?” 

“That should be the top of 
Dan Merrol’s head,” she said 
softly. 

He was a good six inches taller 
than he ought to be. But there 
must be some explanation for 
the added height. He glanced 
down at his legs. They were the 
same length from hip bone to 
the soles of his feet, but the 
proportions differed from one 
side to the other. His knees didn’t 
match. Be-dum, be-dum, be- 
dumdum, but your knees don’t 
match — the snatch of an ancient 
song floated through his head. 

Quickly, he scanned himself. 
It was the same elsewhere. The 
upper right arm was massive, 
too big for the shoulder it merged 
with. And the forearm, while long, 
was slender. He blinked and look- 
ed again. While they were patch- 



ing him up, did they really think 
he needed black, red and brown 
hair? He wondered how a beagle 
felt. 

HAT were they, a bunch of 
humorists? Did they, for 
comic effect, piece together a 
body out of bits and scraps left 
over from a chopping block? It 
was himself he was looking at, 
otherwise he’d say the results 
were neither hideous nor horrible, 
but merely — well, what? Ludi- 
crous and laughable — and there 
were complications in that too. 
Who wants to be an involuntary 
clown, a physical buffoon that 
Mother Nature hadn’t duplicated 
since Man began? 

He felt the stubble on his face 
with his left hand — he thought 
it was his left hand — at least it 
was on that side. The emerging 
whiskers didn’t feel like anything 
he remembered. Wait a minute — 
was it his memory? He leaned 
against the wall and nearly fell 
down. The length of that arm 
was unexpectedly different. 

He hobbled over to a chair and 
sat down, staring miserably at 
Erica as she began dressing. 
There was quite a contrast be- 
tween the loveliness of her body 
and the circus comedy of his own. 

“Difficult, isn’t it?” she said, 
tugging her bra together and 
closing the last snap, which took 
considerable effort. She was a 




10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



small girl generally, though not 
around the chest. 

It was difficult and in addition 
to his physique there were the 
memories he couldn’t account for. 
Come to think of it, he must 
have been awfully busy to have 
so many careers in such a short 
time — and all those wives too. 

Erica came close and leaned 
comfortingly against him, but 
he wasn’t comforted. “I waited 
till I was sure. I didn’t want to 
upset you.” 

He wasn’t as sure as she seem- 
ed to be now. Somehow, maybe 
he was still Dan Merrol — but he 
wasn’t going to insist on it — not 
after looking at himself. Not 
after trying to sort out those 
damned memories. 

She was too kind, pretending 
to be a little attracted to him, to 
the scrambled face, to the mis- 
matched lumps and limbs and 
shapes that, stretching the term, 
currently formed his’ body. It 
was clear what he had to do. 

T HE jacket he had worn last 
night didn’t fit. Erica cut off 
the sleeve that hung far over his 
fingertips on one side and basted 
it to the sleeve that ended well 
above his wrist, on the qther. The 
shoulders were narrow, but the 
material would stretch and after 
shrugging around in it, he man- 
aged to expand it so it was not 
too tight. 

THE MAN WHO WAS SIX 



The trousers were also a prob- 
lem — six inches short with no 
material to add on, but here 
again Erica proved equal to the 
task and, using the cuffs, contriv- 
ed to lengthen them. Shoes were 
another difficulty. For one foot 
the size was not bad, but he could 
almost step out of the other shoe. 
When she wasn’t looking, he 
wadded up a spare sock and 
stuffed it in the toe. 

He looked critically at himself 
in the mirror. Dressed, his total 
effect was better than he had 
dared hope it would be. True, he 
did look different. 

Erica gazed at him with mel- 
ancholy affection. “I can’t under- 
stand why they let you out wear- 
ing those clothes — or for that 
matter, why they let you out 
at all.” 

He must have given some ex- 
planation as he’d stumbled 
through the door. What was it? 

“When I brought the clothes 
yesterday, they told me I couldn’t 
see you for a day or so,” she 
mused aloud. “It was the first 
time you’d been out of the re- 
growth tank — where no one could 
see you — and they didn’t know 
the clothes wouldn’t fit. You were 
covered with a sheet, sleeping, I 
think. They let me peek in and 
I could make out a corner of 
your face.” 

It was the clothes, plus the 
brief glimpse of his face, which 

11 



had made her think she recog- 
nized him when he came in. 

“They told me you’d have to 
have psychotherapy and I’d have 
to have orientation before I 
could see you. That’s why I 
was so surprised when you rang 
the bell.” 

His head was churning with 
ideas, trying to sort them out. 
Part of last night was dim, part 
sharp and satisfying. 

“What’s Wysocki’s theorem?” 
she asked. 

“Whose theorem?” 

“Wysocki’s. I started to call 
the hospital and you wouldn’t 
let me, because of the theorem. 
You said you’d explain it this 
morning.” She glanced at' the 
bruise on her arm. 

It was then he’d grabbed her, 
to keep her from talking to the 
hospital. He’d been unnecessarily 
rough, but that could be ascribed 
to lack of coordination. She could 
have been terrified, might have 
resisted — but she hadn’t. At that 
time, she must have , half -be- 
lieved he was Dan Merrol, still 
dangerously near the edges of 
post-regrowth shock. 

S HE was looking at him, wait- 
ing for that explanation. He 
shook his mind frantically and 
the words came out. “Self-ther- 
apy,” he said briskly. “The pa- 
tient alone understands what he 
needs.” She started to interrupt, 



but he shook his head and went 
on blithely. “That’s the first cor- 
ollary of the theorem. The second 
is that there are critical times 
in the recovery of the patient. 
At such times, with the least 
possible supervision, he should be 
encouraged to make his own de- 
cisions and carry them through 
by himself, even though running 
a slight risk of physical compli- 
cations.” 

“That’s new, isn’t it?” she said. 
“I always thought they watched 
the patient carefully.” 

It ought to be new — he’d just 
invented it. “You know how rap- 
idly medical practices change,” 
he said quickly. “Anyway, when 
they examined me last night, I 
was much stronger than they ex- 
pected — so, when I wanted to 
come home, they let me. It’s their 
latest belief that initiative is more 
important than perfect health.” 

“Strange,” she muttered. “But 
you are very strong.” She looked 
at him and blushed. “Initiative, 
certainly you have. Dan could 
use some, wherever he is.” 

Dan again, whether it was him- 
self or another person. For a 
brief time, as she listened to 
him, he’d had the silly idea that 
. But it could never happen to 
him. He’d better leave now while 
she was distracted and bewilder- 
ed and believed what he was say- 
ing. “I’ve got to go. I’m due 
back,” he told her.

“Not before you eat,” she said. 
“Any man who’s spent the night 

with me is hungry in the morn-

ing. 

It was a domestic miracle that 
amidst all the pressing and fit- 
ting, she’d somehow prepared 
breakfast and he hadn’t noticed. 
It was a simple chore with the 
automatics, but to him it seemed 
a proof of her wifely skill. 

He wanted to protest, but 
didn’t. Maybe it was the hand 
she was holding — it seemed to 
be equipped with a better set of 
nerves than its predecessor. It 
tingled at her touch. Sadly, he 
sat down and looked at his food. 
Eat? Did he want to eat? Oddly 
enough, he did. 

“How much do you remember 
of the accident?” She shoved 
aside her own food and sat 
watching him. 

TVTO'jr a thing, now that she 
asked. In fact, there wasn’t 
much he did remember. There 
had been the chart at his bed- 
side, with one word scrawled on 
it — accident — and that was where 
he’d got the idea. There had 
been other marks too, but he 
hadn’t been able to decipher 
them. He nodded and said noth- 
ing and she took it as he thought 
she would. 

“It wasn’t anybody’s fault. The 
warning devices which were sup- 
posed to work didn’t,” she began. 



“A Moon ship collided with a 
Mars liner in the upper atmos- 
phere. The ships broke up in 
several parts and since they are 
compartmented and the delay 
rockets switched on immediately, 
the separate parts fell rather 
gently, considering how high they 
were. Casualties weren’t as great 
as you might think. 

“Parts of the two ships fell 
together, the rest were scattered. 
There was some interchange of 
passengers in the wreckage, but 
since you were found in the con- 
trol compartment of the Mars 
liner, they assumed you were the 
pilot. They never let me see you 
until yesterday and then it was 
just a glimpse. I took their word 
when they said you were Dan 
Merrol.” 

At least he knew who or what 
Dan Merrol was — the pilot of the 
Mars liner. They had assumed 
he was the pilot because of where 
he was found, but he might have 
been tossed there — impact did 
strange things. 

Dan Merrol was a spaceship 
pilot and he hadn’t included it 
among his skills. It was strange 
that she had believed him at all. 
But now that it was out in the 
open, he did remember some 
facts about spaceships. He felt 
he could manage a takeoff at 
this instant. 

But why hadn’t he told her? 
Shock? Perhaps — but where had 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX

those other identities come from 
— lepidopterist, musician, actor, 
mathematician and wrestler? 
And where had he got memories 
of wives, slender and passionate, 
petite and wild, casual and com- 
plaisant, nagging and insecure? 

Erica he didn’t remember at 
all, save from last night, and 
what was that due. to? 

“What are you going to do?” 
he asked, deliberately toying with 
the last bite of breakfast. It gave 
him time to think. 

“They said they’d identified 
everyone, living or dead, and I 
supposed they had. After seeing 
you, I can believe they made any 
number of similar mistakes. Dan 
Merrol may be alive under an- 
other name. It will be hard to do, 
but I must try to find him. Some 
of the accident victims went to 
other hospitals, you know, the 
ones located nearest where they 
fell.” 

Even if he was sure, he didn’t 
know whether he could tell her 
— and he wasn’t sure any longer, 
although he had been. On the 
physical side of marriage, how 
could he ask her to share a body 
she’d have to laugh at? Later, 
he might tell her, if there was 
to be a ‘later.’ He pushed back 
his chair and looked at her un- 
certainly. 

‘Let me call a ’copter,” she 
said. “I hate to see you go.” 

“Wysocki’s theorem,” he told 



her. “The patient has decided to 
walk.” He weaved toward the 
door and twisted the knob. He 
turned in time to catch her in 
his arms. 

“I know this is wrong,” she 
said, pressing against him. 

It might be wrong, but it was 
very pleasant, though he did 
guess her motives. She was a 
warmhearted girl and couldn’t 
help pitying him. “Don’t be so 
damned considerate,” he mum- 
bled. 

“You’ll have to put me down,” 
she said, averting her eyes. 
“Otherwise . You’re an in- 
tolerable funny man.” 

He knew it — he could see him- 
self in the mirror. He was some- 
thing to laugh at when anyone 
got tired of pretending sympathy. 
He put her down and stumbled 
out. He thought he could hear 
the bed creak as she threw her- 
self on it. 

II 

O NCE he .got started, walking 
wasn’t hard. His left side 
swung at a different rate from 
his right, but that was due to 
the variation in the length of his 
thighs and lower legs, and the two 
rhythms could be reconciled. He 
swept along, gaining control of 
his muscles. He became aware 
that he was whizzing past every- 
one.

He slowed down — he didn’t 
want to attract attention. It was 
difficult but he learned to walk 
at a pedestrian pace. However 
poorly they’d matched his legs, 
they’d given him good ones. 

Last night, on an impulse, he’d 
left the hospital and now he had 
to go back. Had to? Of course. 
There were too many uncertain- 
ties still to be settled. He glanced 
around. It was still very early 
in the morning and normal traf- 
fic was just beginning. Maybe 
they hadn’t missed him yet, 
though it was unlikely. 

He seemed to know the route 
well enough and covered the 
distance in a brief time. He turn- 
ed in at the building and, scan- 
ning the directory, went at once 
to the proper floor and stopped 
at the desk. 

T HE receptionist was busy 
with the drawer of the desk. 
“Can I help you?” she asked, 
continuing to peer down. 

“The director — Doctor Cran- 
der. I don’t have an appoint- 
ment.” 

“Then the director can’t see 
you.” The girl looked up and her 
firmly polite expression ^became a 
grimace of barely suppressed 
laughter. 

Then laughter was swept away. 
What replaced it he couldn’t say, 
but it didn’t seem related to hu- 
mor. She placed her hand near 



his but it went astray and got 
tangled with his fingers. “I just 
thought of a joke,” she murmur- 
ed. “Please don’t think that I 
consider you at all funny.” 

The hell she didn’t — and it 
was the second time within the 
hour a woman had used that 
word on him. He wished they’d 
stop. He took back his hand, the 
slender one, an exquisite thing 
that might once have belonged to 
a musician. Was there an in- 
strument played with one hand? 
The other one was far larger and 
clumsier, more suited to mayhem 
than music. “When can I see the 
director?” 

She blinked at him. “A pa- 
tient?” She didn’t need to look 
twice to see that he had been 
one. “The director does occa- 
sionally see ex-patients.” 

He watched her appreciatively 
as she went inside. The way she 
walked, you’d think she had a 
special audience. Presently the 
door opened and she came back, 
batting her eyes vigorously. 

“You can go in now,” she said 
huskily. Strange, her voice had 
dropped an octave in less than a 
minute. “The old boy tried to 
pretend he was in the middle of a 
grave emergency.” 

On his way in, he miscalculat- 
ed, or she did, and he brushed 
against her. The touch was plea- 
sant, but not thrilling. That re- 
action seemed reserved for Erica. 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX 



15 



“Glad to see you,” said Doctor 
Crander, behind the desk. He 
was nervous and harassed for 
so early in the morning. “The 
receptionist didn’t give me your 
name. For some reason she seems 
upset.” 

She did at that, he thought — 
probably bewildered by his ap- 
pearance. The hospital didn’t 
seem to have a calming influence 
on either her or the doctor. 
“That’s why I came here. I’m 
not sure who I am. I thought I 
was Dan Merrol.” 

Doctor Crander tried to fight 
his way through the desk. Being 
a little wider and solider, though 
not by much, the desk won. He 
contented himself by wiping his 
forehead. “Our missing patient,” 
he said, sighing with vast relief. 
“For a while I had visions of 
. He then decided that visions 
were nothing a medical man 
should place much faith in. 

“Then I am Dan Merrol?” 

The doctor came cautiously 
around the desk this time. “Of 
course. I didn’t expect that you’d 
come walking in my office — 
that’s why I didn’t recognize you 
immediately.” He exhaled peev- 
ishly. “Where did you go? We’ve 
been searching for you every- 
where.” 

It seemed wiser to Dan not to 
tell him everything. “It was 
stuffy inside. I went out for a 
stroll before the nurse came in.” 



Crander frowned, his nervous- 
ness rapidly disappearing. “Then 
it was about an hour ago. We 
didn’t think you could walk at 
all so soon, or we would have 
kept someone on duty through 
the night.” 

fTTHEY had underestimated 
him, but he didn’t mind. Of 
course, he didn’t know how a 
patient from the regrowth tanks 
was supposed to act. The doctor 
took his pulse. “Seems fine,” he 
said, surprised. “Sit down — 
please sit down.” 

Without waiting for him to 
comply, Crander pushed him into 
a chair and began hauling out a 
variety of instruments with which 
he poked about his bewildered 
patient. 

Finally Crander seemed satis- 
fied. “Excellent,” he said. “If I 
didn’t know better, I’d say you 
were almost fully recovered. A 
week ago, we considered remov- 
ing you from the regrowth tank. 
Our decision to leave you there 
an extra week has paid off very, 
very nicely.” 

Merrol wasn’t as pleased as 
the doctor appeared to be. 
“Granted you can identify me as 
the person who came out of re- 
growth — but does that mean I’m 
Dan Merrol? Could there be a 
mistake?” 

Crander eyed him clinically. 
“We don’t ordinarily do this — 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



but it is evident that with you 
peace of mind is more important 
than procedure. And you look 
well enough to stand the physical 
strain.” 

He pressed the buzzer and an 
angular woman in her early for- 
ties answered. “Miss Jerrems, the 
Dan Merrol file.” 

Miss Jerrems flashed a glance 
of open adoration at the doctor 
and before she could reel it in, 
her gaze swept past Dan, hesitat- 
ed and returned to him. Her 
mouth opened and closed like 
that of a nervous goldfish and 
she darted from the room. 

They see me and flee as fast as 
they can caper, thought Merrol. 
It was not wholly true — Crander 
didn’t seem much affected. But 
he was a doctor and used to it. 
Furthermore, he probably had 
room for only one emotion at 
the moment — relief at the return 
of his patient. 

Miss Jerrems came back, 
wheeling a large cart. Dan was 
surprised at the mass of records. 
Crander noticed his expression 
and smiled. “You’re our prize 
case, Merrol. I’ve never heard of 
anyone else surviving such ex- 
tensive surgery. Naturally, we 
have a step-by-step account of 
everything we did.” 

He turned to the woman. “You 
may leave, Miss Jerrems.” She 
went, but the adoration she had 
showed so openly for her employ- 



er seemed to have curdled in the 
last few moments. 

Crander dug into the files and 
rooted out photographs. “Here 
are pictures of the wreckage in 
which you were found — notice 
that you were strapped in your 
seat — as you were received into 
the hospital — at various stages in 
surgery and finally, some taken 
from the files of the company for 
which you worked.” 

Merrol winced. The photo- 
graphic sequence was incontro- 
vertible. He had been a 
handsome fellow. 

“Here is other evidence you 
may not have heard of. It’s a re- 
cent development, within the last 
ten years, in fact. It still isn’t 
accepted by most courts — they’re 
always lagging — but to medical 
men it’s the last word.” 

m'ERROL studied the patterns 
of waves and lines and 
splotches. “What is it?” 

“Mass-cell radiographs. One 
was loaned by your employer. 
The other was taken just after 
your last operation. Both were 
corrected according to standard 
methods. One cell won’t do it, 
ten yield an uncertain identity — 
but as few as a hundred cells 
from any part of the original 
body, excepting the blood, con- 
stitute proof more positive than 
fingerprints before the surgical 
exchange of limbs. Don’t ask me 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX 



17 



why — no one knows. But it is 
true that cells differ from one 
body to the next, and this test 
detects the difference.” 

The mass-cell radiographs did 
seem identical and Dr. Crander 
seemed certain. Taken altogether, 
the evidence was overwhelming. 
There had been no mistake — he 
was Dan Merrol, though it was 
not difficult to understand why 
Erica couldn’t believe he was her 
husband. 

“You did a fine job,” he said. 
Recalling the picture of the 
wreckage, he knew they had. 
“But couldn’t you have done just 
a little better?” 

C RANDER’S eyebrows bounc- 
ed up. “We’re amazed at 
how well we have done. You 
can search case histories and find 
nothing comparable.” His eye- 
brows dropped back into place. 
“Of course, if you have a spe- 
cific complaint . .” 

“Nothing specific. But look at 
this hand . .” 

The doctor seized it. “Beauti- 
ful, isn’t it?” 

“Perhaps — taken by itself.” 
Dan rolled up his sleeve. “See 
how it joins the forearm.” 
Crander waggled it gravely. “It 
coordinates perfectly. I’ve ob- 
served you have complete control 
over it. The doctor’s eye, my boy. 
The doctor’s diagnostic eye.” 
The other just didn’t under- 



stand. “But the size — it doesn’t 
match my arm!” 

“Doesn’t match?" cried the 
doctor. “Do you have any idea 
of the biological ways in which it 
does match? True, it may not be 
esthetically harmonized, but here 
we delve into the mysteries of 
the human organism, and we 
can hardly be striving for Bot- 
ticelli bodies and Michelangelo 
men. First, your hand moves free- 
ly at the joint, a triumph of sur- 
gical skill.” He moved the hand 
experimentally, to show Merrol 
how it was done. He dropped the 
hand and hurried to a screen 
against the wall. 

Crander drew his finger across 
the surface and the mark re- 
mained. “You know about Rh 
positive and negative blood. 
Mixed, they can be lethal. This 
was discovered long ago, by 
someone I’ve forgotten. But there 
are other factors just as potent 
and far more complex.” 

He scribbled meaningless sym- 
bols on the screen with his finger. 
“Take the bone factors — three. 
They must be matched in even 
such a slight contact as a joint 
. this was done. Then there are 
the tissue factors — four. Tendon 
factors — two. Nerve-splice fac- 
tors — three again. After that, we 
move into a complex field, hor- 
mone-utilization factors — seven 
at the lastest count and more 
coming up with further research.

“That’s the beginning, but at 
the sensory organs we leave the 
simple stuff behind. Take the 
eye, for instance.” Merrol leaned 
away because Dr. Crander seem- 
ed about to pluck one of Dan’s 
eyes from its socket. “Surgical 
and growth factors involved in 
splicing a massive nerve bundle 
pass any layman’s comprehen- 
sion. There are no non-technical 
terms to describe it.” 

I T was just as well — Merrol 
didn’t want a lecture. He ex- 
tended his arms. One was of 
normal length, the other longer. 
“Do you think you can do some- 
thing with this? I don’t mind 
variation in thickness — some of 
that will smooth out as I exercise 
— but I’d like them the same 
length.” 

“There were many others in- 
jured at the same time, you 
know — and you were one of the 
last to be extricated from the 
ship. Normally, when we have 
to replace a whole arm, we do so 
at the shoulder for obvious rea- 
sons. But the previously treated 
victims had depleted our sup- 
plies. Some needed only a hand 
and we gave them just that, 
others a hand and a forearm, and 
so on. When we got to you, we 
had to use leftovers or permit 
you to die — there wasn’t time to 
send to other hospitals. In fact 
there wasn’t any time at all — we 



actually thought you were dead, 
but soon found we were wrong.” 
Crander stared at a crack in 
the ceiling. “Further recovery will 
take other operations and your 
nervous system isn’t up to it.” 
He shook his head. “Five years 
from now, we can help you, not 
before.” 

Merrol turned away miserably. 
There were other things, but he 
had learned the essentials. He 
was Dan Merrol and there was 
nothing they could do for him 
until it was too late. How long 
could he expect Erica to wait? 

The doctor hadn’t finished the 
medical session. “Replacement of 
body parts is easy, after all. The 
big trouble came when we went 
into the brain.” 

“Brain?” Dan was startled. 
“How hard do you think your 
skull is?” Crander came closer. 
“Bend your head.” 

Merrol obeyed and could feel 
the doctor’s forefinger slice across 
his scalp in a mock operation. 
“This sector was crushed.” 
Roughly half his brain, it appear- 
ed. That’s why so many mem- 
ories were gone — not just from 
shock. “In addition, other sectors 
were damaged and had to be re- 
placed.” 

Crander traced out five areas 
he could feel, but not see. “Sam- 
uel Kaufman, musician — Breed 
Mannly, cowboy actor — George 
Elkins, lepidopterist — Duke De- 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX 



19 



Caesares, wrestler — and Ben Ei- 
senberg, mathematician, went 
into the places I tapped.” 

Dan raised his head. Some 
things were clearer. The memor- 
ies were authentic, but they 
weren’t his — nor did the other 
wives belong to him. It was no 
wonder Erica had cringed at their 
names. 

“These donors were dead, but 
you can be thankful we had parts 
of their brains available.” (Grand- 
er delved into the file and came 
up with a sheet. 

“Here are some body part con- 
tributors.” He read rapidly. 
“Dimwiddie, Barton, Colton, 
Morton, Flam and Camera were 
responsible for arms and hands. 
Greenberg, Rochefault, Gonzal- 
ez, Tail-Cloud, Gowraddy and 
Tsin supplied feet and legs.” 

H E was not a man, Merrol 
thought. Not now. If any- 
thing, he was a convention and 
one body was not a large enough 
hotel to hold it in comfort. 

“These were the major human 
donors, but there were others I 
didn’t bother to read, for the 
kidneys and so on. And I think 
our four-footed friends deserve 
some mention.” He looked up. 
“The skin on your face is from 
a pig embryo.” 

That explained why it was 
hard to shave. “Oink?” he said. 
“I mean did it have to be a pig?” 



“You’d be surprised how hard 
it is to transplant human skin,” 
commented Crander. “Besides, 
we wanted to give you a mascu- 
line look. The finest face there 
, is, genuine pigskin.” 

Merrol felt like a wallet. 

The doctor droned on through 
the list, but Merrol scarcely lis- 
tened. Only once did he interrupt, 
to ask incredulously, “Did you 
say a horse?” 

“Is there anything wrong with 
a horse?” 

Merrol thought back. Come to 
consider it, there was nothing 
wrong — in fact, compliments 
were more in order. 

“The skill that went into 
matching the unrelated parts that 
are now you is a landmark in 
medical history, quite comparable 
to Harvey’s discovery of the cir- 
culation of the blood,” said Dr. 
Crander. “I wouldn’t believe it 
if I hadn’t participated in it my- 
self. There have been limb and 
brain replacements before, but 
never on such a scale. One of 
these days, we’ll get out a report 
that will astound the medical 
world.” 

Without doubt, it would. Mer- 
rol tried to feel grateful, but 
gratitude refused to come. They 
had saved him — but was it worth 
it? 

Puzzled, Crander frowned at 
the buzzer. He’d been pressing 
it intermittently for the past few 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



minutes. “Doesn’t seem to be 
working,” he muttered, heading 
toward the door through which 
Merrol had entered. “Wait here 
— I’ll be back. I have to cancel 
an appointment.” 

A S soon as the door closed, a 
voice behind Merrol hissed. 
“I fixed the buzzer. He went for 
the guards.” 

He whirled. Miss Jerrems stood 
in the doorway that led into the 
filing room on the opposite side 
of the office. “Guards?” he re- 
peated. 

“Of course — guards for the 
violent patients.” 

“What does that have to do 
with me?” 

“You escaped once, didn’t 
you?” 

He hadn’t escaped, he had 
merely walked out when he felt 
he could. Did that qualify him 
as violent? It might. “What of 
it? I’m no longer a patient. The 
doctor said I had recovered.” 
“That’s what he said to you. 
But even if he means it, there’s 
always psychotherapy, post-re- 
growth orientation.” 

Orientation — he hadn’t thought 
of that. They’d want to keep 
him under observation for several 
days and he had no desire to 
stay hospitalized. Erica would 
come to the hospital in a few 
hours. Perhaps she was there 
now, waiting to see someone. 



Come to think of it, he had got 
past the receptionist with re- 
markable ease. At any rate, if 
she was insistent about it, she 
must eventually get to see the 
evidence he had just studied. 

And then there would be orien- 
tation — for both of them. 

Without doubt, he would be 
taught to' accept himself as he 
was, and Erica would be trained 
to look at him without laughter, 
and together they would know 
that beneath his piebald exterior 
lurked a lovely personality. Then, 
well adjusted, they would go 
home and live happily ever after. 
Or would they? 

“Don’t stand there, if you want 
to get away,” Miss Jerrems whis- 
pered urgently. “Next time they 
won’t take any chances.” 

They wouldn’t. He would be 
confined to a room he couldn’t 
break out of with guards dis- 
guised as nurses. Blindly he 
moved toward the door. 

“Not there,” she exclaimed. 
“Do you want to walk right into 
them? This way. They won’t 
look for you in here.” She clasped 
his hand in her bony fingers and 
led him through the maze of files 
to an elevator. “This takes you 
to the ground floor,” she said. 
“Once outside, you can get 
away.” 

He probably could — it was a 
large building and it would take 
a prolonged search to determine 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX 



21 




that he was not inside it. 

She smiled peculiarly, clearing 
her throat. “Thirty-seven Brigh- 
ton Drive.” 

Mechanically he repeated the 
number. “What is it?” 

“That’s where you can find 
out.” 

“Find out what?” 

“What they did to you here. 

I can’t tell you now,” she whis- 
pered nervously. “Oh, do hurry!” 

If he had to move fast, this 
seemed a good time. The elevator 
dropped him to the street level 
and, looking cautiously around, 
he walked out. In a few minutes, 
he was blocks away. It was mid- 
morning, and he swung along, 
hands thrust into his jacket. 
There was a wad of paper inside 
and he fished it out and examined 
it — money, neatly folded with a 
note around it. 

The note was from Erica, say- 
ing that the money was meant 
for him. The sum was not great, 
but she must have given him 
everything she had in the house. 
Mistily, he counted it out. 

Ill 

D AN hadn’t been stopped and 
didn’t expect to be. He wasn’t 
a criminal, but until the hospital 
released him, he was technically 
a mental case. But Crander 
would hardly be anxious to re- 
port to the police that a patient 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

was missing — not until he had 
tried everything else. 

Merrol took the elevator. It 
was a bright new apartment 
building, which conferred some 
social status and not much else 
on those living in it. 

Miss Jerrems opened the door. 
“Come in,” she said, looking 
around furtively as he slipped 
past her. 

He sat down gingerly, watch- 
ing her scurry about. He tried 
to protest, but nothing he said 
had any effect on her aggressive 
hospitality. She thrust a cup of 
watery coffee in his hand and 
placed a tray of breakfast rolls 
beside him. 

She sat facing him. Their knees 
almost touched — it was a narrow 
room. “I came home at once,” 
she said, not very successful in 
her attempt to control her ex- 
citement. “I told them I was up- 
set and, after my long years of 
service, they didn’t question me. 
I tore my dress and told them 
you had done it. I said that you 
ran up toward the top of the 
building.” 

He appreciated her motives, 
but thought she shouldn’t have 
tried so hard to convince them. 
Now they had reason to think 
he was violent. 

“Until today, I’ve been devoted 
to Doctor Crander,” she said 
sternly. 

He recalled the first look on 



her face in the doctor’s office — 
and the one after she had seen 
him. In seconds, her whole atti- 
tude had changed. Why? 

“I heard what he told you.” 
She hissed the word — “Lies.” 
Dan stared at her skeptically. 
“They didn’t do what he said?” 
“Oh, the facts were straight 
enough,” she said bitterly. “It 
was the reasons he concealed. 
They thought you didn’t have a 
chance, so they did all sorts of 
strange things they never tried on 
anyone else. You were an experi- 
ment, that’s all — but you sur- 
prised them.” 

The hospital was looking for 
the wrong mental case. They had 
one working for them and didn’t 
know it. He didn’t doubt that 
she was right — about his being 
an experiment — but her observa- 
tions were wrong. It was due 
entirely to their unorthodox pro- 
cedures that he was alive. 

She looked him over carefully 
and he knew that the halves of 
his face didn’t match by a ridicu- 
lous margin, that one shoulder 
was heavier than the other, that 
his hair was in three colors. Even 
in repose and fully clothed, so 
that some of the discrepancies 
of his physique were hidden, he 
was hardly presentable. 

“When I saw you standing 
there today, I realized what they 
had done to you and my loyalty 
to the institution and the doctor 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



vanished,” she said earnestly. 
“And the psychotherapy isn’t to 
help you, it’s to make sure you 
won’t protest over what they’ve 
done. That’s why I had to get 
you away. They’ve ruined you 
and now you must ruin them.” 

He had half-suspected it would 
come to this — but he hadn’t been 
sure. “I don’t want to ruin them,” 
he said slowly. “I’d rather be 
alive, even as an experiment. 
And if you’re thinking of a mal- 
practice suit, you saw the files. I 
couldn’t win against that.” 

“I ought to know about the 
files — I worked on them.” Her 
eyes sparkled and her voice low- 
ered. “What if the evidence is 
missing?” 

H E sat back. With her co- 
operation, the vital parts of 
the file could vanish and, with 
that gone, he could collect a 
staggering amount from the in- 
stitution. He had only to appear 
and no jury or panels of experts 
would decide against him. Is that 
what she had planned so swiftly 
in the director’s office — that she 
would share the money with him? 
Somehow, he couldn’t believe 
money meant that much to her. 
“I can’t permit it,” he said. “In 
spite of everything, I feel ob- 
ligated.” 

She flung herself across the 
narrow space. “I expected you 
to be noble,” she sobbed. “One 



look at you, and I knew I had 
met the loneliest person in the 
world.” 

Like called to like, at least for 
her, and that explained why she 
had grimaced when she had first 
seen him. It was her counterpart 
of the receptionist’s reaction. It 
explained, too, why she was will- 
ing to turn against the doctor 
she had previously adored. As 
for the money, she didn’t want it 
for herself, but as bait for him — 
and he’d have to take her with it. 

She had guessed wrong on all 
counts. He would have thrust her 
away, but it would have been too 
cruel. He tried to comfort her, 
and she dried her eyes on his 
shoulder. “Darling,” she sniffled. 
“I’ve never yielded to any man, 
but if it will help you . .” 

She pressed close and he 
couldn’t get away without break- 
ing through the thin walls of the 
cramped apartment. He had 
never known a female form could 
be shaped around so many bones. 
“These things take time,” he said, 
though they didn’t. “Let’s not 
rush into anything we’ll regret.” 
He seemed to arouse the mother- 
ly instinct in some women, if 
only in the future tense. 

Presently, she sat up, blowing 
her nose and looking ardently at 
him through tear-rimmed eyes. 
“You can stay here. You’ve no 
place else to go, and they’ll be 
looking for you.” 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX

“Well,” he said — but it was 
true. He shouldn’t be wandering 
on the streets. 

He slept that night on a sink 
that converted to a bed. It would 
have been more comfortable un- 
converted. 

H E crept *out in the morning 
before she was awake. He 
paused outside to scribble a note, 
principally to throw her off his 
track. You never could tell with 
so unstable a person. Implicated 
in his escape, she might neverthe- 
less report to the hospital. He 
shoved the note under the door 
and left quickly apd quietly. 

His first move was to buy a 
hat, which entailed further 
trouble. The doctors had over- 
compensated in replacing the 
missing brain tissue and, in piec- 
ing a skull together, had con- 
structed an outsized head on 
which nothing seemed to fit. By 
careful shopping, he found some- 
thing that did fit and, when he’d 
clapped it on, he happily noted 
it concealed the tricolor hair . 
one item less to attract attention. 

He ate and afterward walk- 
ed to the rocketport. It was a 
long distance and formerly he 
might have complained, but now 
he didn’t mind it. The miles 
seemed to have shrunk to fur- 
longs. 

He found the big Interplanet 
sign and examined the place 



minutely from the outside. Once 
he had worked there, technically 
he still did. Some memories came 
back, but not many. He needed 
at least an hour inside to enable 
him to forget the hospital and its 
psychotherapy. 

Once cleared, he would be free 
for a while to concentrate on what 
to do about Erica. 

The hospital evidently had yet 
to call in the police, He was still 
safe on the streets, but the med- 
icos must have notified Inter- 
planet and all other places at 
which he might show up. How- 
ever, the company was too big 
for everyone to know about him 
this soon. More likely there would 
be only a few who could have 
information on him as yet. The 
trick was to bypass those in- 
dividuals who might try to de- 
tain him and still get where he 
wanted. 

Normally, he’d go to the front 
office after an accident. This time, 
he went to the side gate and 
when the guard looked at him 
questioningly, mumbled, “Re- 
porting for duty.” Which got him 
through. 

Inside, there were more mem- 
ories awaiting him. Depending on 
them, he walked rapidly through 
hall after hall and finally found 
the desk he sought. The man 
behind it looked up. “Are you 
sure you’re in the right place?” 
he asked. 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Merrol would soon know. “Re- 
porting for duty,” he stated. 

This reply elicited a puzzled 
expression. “The devil you are. 
We haven’t hired anyone new.” 
“I’m not new. I’ve been injured, 
and this is my first time back. 
Dan Merrol’s my name.” 

“Okay, where’s your slip?” 
“Slip?” he asked, stalling. This 
was something he ought to know 
about, but didn’t. 

“Sure, the release from the 
front office after an injury.” 

“They said they’d send it 
down,” he replied, holding his 
breath. 

T HE clerk pawed through the 
stack. “They don’t send noth- 
ing down,” he growled. “I’ll call 
and find out.” His hand reached 
out and then he relaxed. “No use 
bothering them, it’ll get here to- 
morrow.” He looked up and 
laughed. “Red tape,” he said by 
way of explanation. “Why should 
I doubt you? If you said they 
released you, then they did.” 
Merrol was glad to see one man 
who wasn’t impressed by office 
routines. Still, his behavior was 
a little puzzling. 

The man screened on. The 
communication unit was behind 
the desk, tilted so he couldn’t 
see it. The volume was low, but 
Dan could hear the conversation 
from this end. “Got a case for 
you. Name is Dan Merrol. I don’t 



know, he’s before my time.” 

The reply was faint and Dan 
didn’t catch it. But the clerk 
added, “He seems okay. What? 
Sure he’s got a release. Would 
I send him in?” 

He cut the connection and 
looked up. “Go over to Psych. 
They’ll test you. If you pass, 
we’ll put you back on schedule.” 
He started to turn away and saw 
Merrol standing there. “What’s 
the matter?” 

“I don’t know where Psych is.” 
“I see. We must have moved 
things since you were here.” The 
man got up and pointed. “Down 
there and turn left at the second 
corner. You can’t miss.” 

The examiner was scanning a 
card as he entered. “Lots of ex- 
perience,” he commented. “We’ll 
pass over the written stuff. That’s 
for kids, to make sure they’ve 
studied their lessons. After you’ve 
been out this long, you can al- 
most feel a course faster than 
anyone can figure it.” 

It was a relief. Merrol didn’t 
know how much theory he re- 
membered, but was sure he could 
still lift a ship as well as the 
next man. 

The examiner made a notation 
on the card and tossed it into a 
machine that snapped it up and 
clicked furiously over it. “Let’s 
take the biggest thing first, if 
you’re up to it.” 

“I feel fine.” It was not true, 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX

but it was the customary answer. 
Anything else, and he’d be shunt- 
ed off into a series of meaningless 
tests, each designed to verify the 
results of previous tests. An in- 
genious scheme rigged up by the 
psych crew in their spare time to 
see how complicated they could 
make any given system. Answered 
straightforwardly, they rushed a 
man through with a minimum of 
officiousness. 

“Okay, let’s take the trip.” 

He accompanied Dan into a 
room unlike the others. For one 
thing, it might have been the con- 
trol room of a ship. Forward, 
there was the usual clear view. 
The stars were there too, in an 
adaptation of the planetarium. 
Outside, arranged to give any 
effect from top acceleration to 
free fall, were a number of gravity 
coils. Except for the pilot — and 
Merrol would play that role — 
there was a full complement of 
officers who were invisible. 

T HE tester flicked on a ma- 
chine. “I’ll give you Mars, be- 
cause that’s your usual run. This 
is a short drive, because you’re 
in a favorable position. Got it?” 
Merrol nodded and climbed 
into the seat, facing the instru- 
ments. 

“I’ve turned on the best crew 
simulators, better than you’d ever 
actually get. Don’t worry about 
them, just take the data and flit 



the way you think you should.” 
The tester clamped a mike inches 
away and adjusted the visio- 
recorders firmly on his head, 
where electron beams could sneak 
in and tap his optic centers. “The 
first trip after you’ve been away 
is rough, but you’ll make it.” 

Merrol strapped himself in and 
hoped the other man was right. 

The examiner went to the door, 
turned and grinned. “Watch out 
for the interplanetary goose,” he 
called and snapped the switch. 

Merrol was now in a ship. In 
the back of his mind there was 
some doubt of his ability, but it 
didn’t reach as far as his fingers. 
Rockets vibrated beneath him. 
Outside, he could see the glazed 
earth-slick. He touched the power 
and climbed above the clouds. 
The sky turned black and there 
were stars. 

He checked position. The tester 
had given him a setup. The Moon 
was out of the way and the run 
to Mars was the shortest on rec- 
ord. If he couldn’t handle this, 
he wasn’t a pilot. 

The seat jabbed him suddenly. 
That’s what he’d been warned 
about — he’d been expecting it and 
still wasn’t prepared. The tem- 
pathy drugs flooded into him and 
the needle was withdrawn. 

Takeoff and landing were al- 
ways rehearsed on the pilot’s own 
time. The ends of a voyage were 
critical and it was essential to 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

have an undistorted reaction. Be- 
sides, neither took long. 

The time between one planet 
and the next was long and noth- 
ing much happened, so it could 
be shortened without deleterious 
effect on the results. Tempathy 
drugs shortened it, though not 
completely. Part of a man’s con- 
sciousness went along at normal 
speed and the rest, that which 
counted in jockeying rockets, was 
enormously telescoped. 

It telescoped on Merrol. He 
couldn’t see. Rather, part of him 
could but, for the other fraction, 
images passed in front of his 
eyes foo fast for his mind to eval- 
uate. Weeks flipped past in min- 
utes. It was a dream world turned 
inside out — the roles of conscious- 
ness and unconsciousness were 
reversed. 

There was something wrong 
with the sounds he half-heard. He 
could get emotions, though he 
couldn’t separate them into sense. 
There were additional voices that 
shouldn’t be there — the mechan- 
ical crew spoke to him giving 
silent data — but there were other 
actual voices, fearful or consola- 
tory. He tried to speak, but his 
vocal cords were preempted. 

He was doing it all, speaking, 
moving the controls, directing the 
ship between planets. It ought to 
be easier than takeoff, but it 
wasn’t. He shouldn’t be afraid of 
anything he might find out there 



— which was nothing — but that 
didn’t alter conditions. He was 
profoundly disturbed, and he 
hoped the tester noticed it. 

The examiner did spot trouble. 
He opened the door and reversed 
the switch. Lights went on, and 
another needle speared him, 
counteracting the effects of the 
tempathy drugs. Slowly the ship 
disappeared, space along with it, 
and the room whirled back into 
view and settled down. Some- 
thing handed him back his eyes 
and ears. 

“Easy,” said the man. “Sit 
there. You don’t have to move. 
We’ll find out what’s wrong. It 
may not be serious at all.” 

U NHOOKING the visio-re- 
corder, the tester also swung 
the mike away. “You were doing 
fine,” he said. “Never saw any- 
thing smoother. About here, 
though, you seemed to be having 
difficulty. We’ll slow it down and 
see what it was.” 

He snapped the reels in place 
and darkened the room. On the 
screen was the vision-port and, 
through it, a view of Mars. A 
fleck of light glittered, grew, be- 
came a cloud, a swarm. A 
swarm? 

“God!” said the tester, bewild- 
ered. “A billion butterflies! How 
could you imagine butterflies, 
twenty million miles from a 
planet?” 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTIO.N 



Merrol squirmed — he didn’t 
know either. What was wrong 
with him to make him dream up 
butterflies? 

The examiner switched the film 
off and the lights on. “So you 
missed them — why, I don’t 
know.” He fiddled with another 
machine. “We’ll slow down the 
sound, synchronize the two of 
them later, but maybe by itself 
the sound will give us a clue as 
to what happened.” 

“What’s that?” It came from 
the sound track, but it was Mer- 
rol’s voice. 

“Those are lepidoptera.” An- 
other voice, also his, though of 
different pitch and timbre — his, 
because he was the only one there 
to speak. “I’ve always dreamed 
of discovering a new species and 
at last I have, since these can 
fly through space. What strange 
adaptations they have made. 
Aren’t they beautiful?” 

He answered. “They won’t be 
when I plow through them. The 
rockets will fry them.” 

“Turn aside!” shouted the 
lepidopterist. “You can’t destroy 
them.” 

“I’m going to act as if this were 
not happening,” said a cultured 
voice. “Bang-bang!” 

“This is upsetting,” said a dif- 
ferent person. “Since I have no 
instrument, I’ll listen with my 
memory to a Bach concerto. Un- 
fortunately, it ends in the middle 



of the third movement, as though 
it has been sliced through with a 
knife that separated one note 
cleanly from the next. Still, it’s 
better to have this than nothing.” 
“Your computers are awfully 
slow,” said the fifth. “I’ll figure 
out a new course for us.” 

“Gimme the controls,” said the 
wrestler. “I’ll turn the ship, if 
I hafta do it with my bare 
hands.” 

The examiner snapped off the 
sound and busied himself with 
things that may have been neces- 
sary. “You don’t have to sit 
there,” he said after a while. 
“Wait outside.” He glanced down, 
“Be careful when you move, the 
control column will fall off. 
Didn’t know it could be broken.” 
As he got out of the seat, the 
examiner slapped his back. “Tell 
you what, fellow — don’t wait — go 
now to the Compensation Board 
and see about retirement.” 

IV 

M ERROL sat in the room 
where he had been sitting 
for a day and a half since the 
psych test. He had walked out 
immediately, found a room and 
was still in it. It wasn’t comfort- 
able, sitting. Whichever position 
was right for the bend of one 
knee was wrong for the other. 

He had depended on the test to 
get him out of a jam, but the 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX 



31 



stratagem had failed. If he had 
passed, he’d have been another 
experienced pilot for the Inter- 
planet string and that meant 
something. Experienced men were 
valuable and I. P. would have 
gone to bat for him. 

Not everyone could pass the 
test and, while it didn’t prove that 
the man who did was one hun- 
dred per cent sane, it was a big 
argument in that direction. It was 
evidence that would have to be 
respected publicly, whatever pri- 
vate doubts a psychotherapist 
might have. 

Unwittingly, he had provided 
additional ammunition against 
himself. When the results of the 
test sifted through the layers of 
red tape to the front office, Inter- 
planet would contact the hospital, 
which would then really want to 
orient him to a frazzle. 

Orientation sounded nice but it 
was not for Merrol. If they could 
orient everyone he would come in 
contact with as well — but how 
much insulation could a man 
build up against involuntary 
laughter? It was fine to be a 
comedian on the screen and then 
step out of character and relax — 
but what if you couldn’t stop? 
Nobody could adjust to the con- 
stant expectation of hysterical 
mirth. But wasn’t that a reason 
to undergo psychotherapy, so 
they could blunt the edges of his 
own reactions? It ought to be, but 



somehow it wasn’t. He didn’t 
dare submit. 

There was a difference, appar- 
ently determined by sex, in the 
way people behaved toward him. 
No man had thus far done more 
than smile respectfully while he 
was near. What they did later, 
he could guess. Face to face, they 
seemed to be reserved and in- 
credulous until they learned to 
accept him as a member of their 
species and sex and then — how 
did they act? It would take more 
than casual thinking to puzzle 
that out. 

Women saw the big joke in- 
stantly and giggled, and he 
couldn’t blame them. Seconds 
later, they smirked contritely and 
tried to touch him, as if contact 
could atone for their behavior. 
They noticed appearance at all 
times, whereas men didn’t as a 
rule of their own sex. _ 

He paused to re-examine his 
thoughts.- Something seemed to 
be missing in his analysis. What 
it was, he couldn’t tell. It would 
have to come out later, as he 
mingled more with people — if he 
ever did. 

A ND that wasn’t all. He had 
been a pilot, but never would 
be one again. His skill had been 
destroyed by the intrusion of five 
other personalities, who each 
brought his own odd bit of use- 
less knowledge to the whole Mer- 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rol. He should have expected it, 
but he hadn’t, nor had the doc- 
tors. 

It was obvious — the brain 
slices that had replaced his own 
damaged tissues had to be in 
healthy condition or they’d never 
have functioned properly — and 
what did those medical fools 
think was the function of any 
brain? He was in command of 
the group brain because, his was 
the dominant fraction, but when 
he sat down and thought about 
it, what good did it do? He was 
sitting down and it didn’t do any 
good, so he got up. 

He took two paces across the 
room and looked out the window, 
into windows that looked into his. 
Compensation was coming to 
him. Ultimately, he’d divide it 
with Erica and go away. She 
must know by now that the 
man she had spent the night 
with was actually her own hus- 
band. Intellectually she must 
have decided to accept him. 

He wasn’t noble, though. Much 
as he wanted her, he knew he 
couldn’t live with anyone who 
had to stifle her laughter when 
he stepped out of the bath or 
into bed. 

He walked the carpet aimlessly 
until, through the window, he 
caught a word from the telecast 
in the next apartment. He 
thought it sounded familiar. He 
yanked the louvers closed and 



grunted, but it didn’t help— the 
word bothered him. He reached 
out the long arm to turn on his 
own screen. 

A face came into view and a 
man’s voice whispered. Merrol 
turned up the volume, but it 
didn’t get any louder. It was 
the low-pressure soothing type. 
Whatever he was selling, it was 
a welcome change. 

The announcer smiled reas- 
suringly. “Actually, I’m talking 
to one person. The rest of you 
may listen or not for the next five 
minutes, after which I’ll have 
something to say to you.” It was 
a clever approach to insure that 
the audience didn’t switch pro- 
grams. 

“Dan Merrol, this is a personal 
message to you.” Merrol sat up. 

“We’d call you if we could, but 
this is a large city and you’ve 
simply vanished. We have opera- 
tives trying to trace you, but 
with no success up to now.” The 
announcer leaned forward con- 
fidentially. 

“Now, Dan, before you become 
alarmed, let me say you’ve done 
nothing wrong. In fact, at Inter- 
planet, we think you’ve done 
everything right — but I’ll come 
to that later.” 

TNTERPLANET? Then it 
-*■ wasn’t the hospital or the po- 
lice. What could I. P. want of 
him? 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX

“No doubt the test you took 
was somewhat of a shock. Don’t 
blame the psych examiner for the 
conclusions he formed — he can’t 
be expected to know more than 
the leading psychologists. You’re 
probably curious as to what this 
test has to do with you and Inter- 
planet. We hope so — we want you 
to keep on listening. 

“The test proved you’re no 
longer a competent pilot — but it 
also indicated something much 
bigger. Dan, you are the answer 
to a problem that has been both- 
ering us for generations. Before 
the accident, you knew nothing 
of music or any life science, 
your math was adequate but not 
deep, you often felt awkward in 
the presence of others when you 
had no need to and you lacked 
confidence in your physical 
ability. 

“Suddenly, you gained some- 
thing of each and, when we con- 
tacted your doctors, we were able 
to surmise how it happened. Now 
you ask — what good does this do 
you and what is the problem to 
which this is the answer? 

“Simply this — specialization. 
You know what constitutes a 
rocket crew — pilot, radio man, 
engineer and several lesser tech- 
nicians, each of whom knows 
only his own job. Although you’ll 
never sit at the controls again — 
through you, we can help others.” 

The announcer lowered his 



voice now. “You can unlock 
specialization for us. In the fu- 
ture, each man will concentrate 
on what particular aptitudes he 
has, then share it, via surgery, 
with others whose knowledge 
complements his own. To do this, 
we need to study you further 
and, of course, we’ll pay you 
well for the opportunity. In addi- 
tion, you’ll still get your com- 
pensation. Please come and talk 
it over with us. 

“Frankly, we’re a little worried 
about what you may be thinking. 
If you have any thoughts of self- 
destruction because of what must 
seem a strange condition, put 
them aside. You’re much saner 
than the average man.” 

M ERROL listened, smiling at 
the remark. No matter what 
they thought, he couldn’t seri- 
ously contemplate suicide. There 
were too many others to dissuade 
him. 

Nevertheless, it was hard to 
understand and accept the sud- 
den change of his status. He had 
formerly been a mere employee, 
but now . 

The announcer hadn’t finished. 
“In the beginning, Dan, I said 
you had done everything right, 
whether you knew it or not. After 
we learned what we did from 
your test, we checked through our 
files and found that we had a 
few other accident cases on record 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in which part of the brain had 
been replaced. In each case there 
was a faint trace of another per- 
sonality, which we could detect 
when we knew what to look for. 
We rechecked each person we 
could locate. Unfortunately, the 
latent personalities - - and their 
share of knowledge had been 
submerged beyond recovery by 
the rigorous psychotherapy the 
accident victim had undergone 
after surgery.” 

T HE imaginary Wysocki’s the- 
orem of self -therapy. He never 
knew of anyone by that name, 
nor had he got it from one of the 
other five. But, however nonsens- 
ically he had invented it to ex- 
press the needs he felt at the 
time, it was, in fact, not nonsense. 
When it came to that, who knew 
anything about six minds pack- 
aged together — and what could 
have been done to him in igno- 
rance? 

The announcer was finished 
talking to Dan Merrol alone. 
“Remember, all of you,” he said 
briskly. “This man is neither a 
criminal nor insane. He is ex- 
tremely withdrawn, as a result of 
unpleasant experiences. If you 
can induce him to come to Inter- 
planet, or lead our representatives 
to him, you will receive a sub- 
stantial reward. Here is his pic- 
ture.” 

Merrol turned off the screen 



and scowled. He didn’t like that 
last. He intended to take their 
offer, but he wanted to be free 
to walk the streets. He could 
settle that easily enough by just 
calling Interplanet. They’d send 
someone down to whisk him 
away. That would solve all his 
problems — or would it? 

Certainly, it eliminated orienta- 
tion or any form of psychother- 
apy. After what had happened 
to the others, the psycholo- 
gists would be content merely to 
observe what went on in his mind. 
They wouldn’t want to give him 
much privacy, but he’d have to 
insist on it. They’d listen. 

This could be just a job, a very 
good job while it lasted — say 
three or four years — until they 
had learned all they need to 
know. Perhaps there would be 
other men blended more scien- 
tifically than he had been. But 
he could accumulate enough 
money to last the rest of his 
life, or perhaps turn his many 
new talents to something else. 
There were many things he would 
like to do, and he was ahead of 
everyone else now, even though 
in three or four years he would 
no longer be unique. 

Except, of course, in his body. 

And there it was again. Was 
there nothing he could do to get 
away from it? 

He had no memory of Erica 
except for the one night, but it

was enough to convince him. 
What would their future be like 
in what was sure to follow? After 
that broadcast, he would be a 
person of some note, but would 
that stop laughter? Would she 
wait until he left the room before 
she giggled? 

He’d come to terms with Inter- 
planet, but first he had to come 
to terms with himself . and 
he hadn’t. 

How good was his imaginary 
Wysocki’s theorem? Could it take 
one last extension? He counted 
what was left of the money Erica 
had given him. It wasn’t much, 
but with it he could leave the 
city. And he had to. 

V 

I T was dusk when he slipped 
out of the room and later still 
when the plane lifted away from 
the station. It was an ancient jet, 
long since relegated to cheap 
overnight service where speed 
was ndt a factor and price was. 

He knew he was taking a 
chance and half expected to be 
stopped, but apparently not 
many people had listened to the 
broadcast. Casual glances slid off 
him and didn’t linger. Partly, he 
suspected, because he had pulled 
his hat over his face and thrust 
his hands in the jacket. He’d 
gotten away in time, but by the 
morning there would be people 



on the streets looking for him. 

He stared at the approxima- 
tion of a port. When this ship had 
been built, there was some feel- 
ing against the practice and so 
the row of picture tubes had been 
camouflaged as ports in the wall. 
There was a station selector 
switch, but none for on or off. He 
glowered at the picture at his 
elbow and turned to the least an- 
noying thing he could find. Across 
the aisle, there were three other 
programs he could see distinctly. 
The one directly opposite was a 
repeat of the broadcast he had 
heard a few hours previously. He 
scowled and looked away. If it 
hadn’t been a night plane, in 
which people sought sleep, he 
would certainly have been spot- 
ted. Apathy was his best protec- 
tion. He hunched down in his 
seat and dozed off. 

When he awakened, the famil- 
iar Interplanet program was at 
his elbow. He reached to change 
stations, then on impulse let his 
hand continue past the knob un- 
til he felt the ash tray. He un- 
fastened the heavy article and 
poked it through the screen. 

The glass broke, but only a 
few in the immediate vicinity 
heard it in the din. To those who 
stared at him, he presented a 
view of his back or the profile 
of his hat. They glanced at him 
indifferently, then looked away. 
Outside the orifice, where the 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tube had been in the outer of 
two walls, was an actual port. 
He gazed through it contentedly. 

A finger tapped him. “Yes?” he 
said in a loud voice. 

The man behind him leaned 
over. “I’ve been riding in this 
plane once a week for five years. 
I mean, would you mind if I 
looked out? I’ve never seen where 
I’m going.” 

“Glad to have you.” 

The man sat beside him and 
peered wistfully out. Below were 
lights, the patterns of cities, roads 
and towns and in the distance 
the glare of furnaces. There was 
also a current of cold air seep- 
ing from the space between the 
double walls. The man looked, 
shivered, turned up his collar 
and finally went back to his seat. 

It was cold, but Merrol re- 
mained where he was. There was 
some satisfaction in asserting 
himself, but the satisfaction wore 
off and the cold didn’t. 

His attention was caught by 
the program which was flickering 
across the aisle. Doctor Crander 
— Merrol frowned. Did the hos- 
pital want him too? He listened 
intently. No, they didn’t want 
him. 

C RANDER sounded tired. 

“This is an emergency ap- 
peal and we’ll need a wide re- 
sponse. We have in our care a 
person with a serious illness we 



can’t diagnose. With so much 
interplanetary travel we can’t de- 
termine what causes the disease. 
It may be an organism from a 
moon of Saturn or almost any- 
thing else. 

“Our staff is working at top 
speed. We feel, if we can keep 
her alive for one week, she’ll be 
out of danger. That is by no 
means a certainty, but a reason- 
ably accurate forecast. * 

“We have a new theory, largely 
untested, but we hope it will 
work. Each person differs from 
the next and though, when we 
match limbs and organs, we try 
to take this into account, we 
never quite succeed in effecting a 
perfect biological match. As a re- 
sult, the character of the blood 
changes, slightly but significantly. 
It’s as if we had lumped together 
the various natural immunities of 
the component bodies and creat- 
ed an entirely new super-immun- 
ity.” 

Crander paused. “We need per- 
sons who have had five or more 
major replacements. By major, I 
mean hands, arms, legs or parts 
of them — nothing so trivial as 
ears, or a few feet of skin, or 
three or four fingers. 

“It must be at least five, 
though more are correspondingly 
better. Nothing less — and please 
don’t apply with only a minor 
replacement. Two donors have 
volunteered so far and we have 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX

fractioned and administered the 
blood of one with dramatic, if 
temporary, results. In a few 
hours, we’ll have to use the sec- 
ond. After that, I don’t know 
what we’ll do.” 

Merrol stirred. He was deeply 
suspicious. 

“Here’s the woman,” said 
Crander. “She needs your help.” 
The man across the aisle lean- 
ed forward and his head was in 
front of the picture. Merrol tried 
to see, but couldn’t. 

“It’s up to you,” said Crander 
as he faded from the screen. 

Merrol tapped the man across 
the aisle. “Please repeat it.” 

The man glanced around and 
saw who it was. “Aw, you’re the 
guy who doesn’t like that stuff.” 
He jerked his head at the broken 
screen. 

The memory cell of the picture 
tube didn’t have a long attention 
span. It could recall forty-five 
seconds of the past program and 
no longer. The broadcast might 
be repeated, or it might not. Did 
he want to wait? 

He reached out his arm — the 
long one — and fastened onto the 
man’s jacket, giving him a short 
rough shove. 

“Repeat it, I said!” 

The man looked down. He 
wasn’t small himself, but it was 
a large fist. “Sure thing,” he said, 
jabbing the repeat button. The 
scene was replayed. 



“Thanks,” said Merrol, letting 
go. 

The man looked at his crum- 
pled clothing. “Not at all,” he 
muttered, sliding away against 
the wall. “Don’t mention it.” 

T HE woman was Erica. It was 
too much of a coincidence 
that, among so many millions in 
the city, she should be the one. 
The hospital and Interplanet 
were working together and now 
they had brought in Erica. How 
gullible did they think he was 
and how much had they offered 
her for this? It might not be 
money, though — they might have 
convinced her it was to Dan’s 
own best interest that they get 
in touch with him immediately. 

They were baiting him crudely 
and if they weren’t, there were 
others who could respond as well 
as he. There must be hundreds 
in the vicinity, scores at any rate, 
who could qualify. There were 
enough without him, depending 
on how often the blood fraction 
was needed. Crander hadn’t said. 
It was a trick and Erica wasn’t 
ill — or if she was, she would be 
safe without him. He had to 
make up his mind before he saw 
her, and he couldn’t. He clenched 
his hands, both big and little. 
He had stretched Wysocki’s the- 
orem too far and it had failed. 

“I had a wife once.” The voice 
startled him, but he sat still, hop- 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing to hear it again. Maybe they 
would tell him what to do. “Not 
so slender as Erica. Rather 
bouncy, in fact, but I liked her. 
Pity she ran away with a coleop- 
terist. Never could understand 
what she saw in him.” The voice 
grew sad. “Beetles!” 

“My advice is that wives are 
easily come by,” said a theatrical 
voice, modulated for effect. “But 
before he shuffles off this mortal 
coil to the last roundup, every 
man should have at least one wife 
like Erica.” 

“I can’t speak of wives or 
women,” said the musician. 
“There’s so little memory left, 
mostly music. But you’ve been 
subconsciously humming a tune 
for days — and I must tell you 
that Beethoven didn’t write any- 
thing called Erica. The correct 
title is Eroica.” 

“One fall don’t mean nothing, 
it’s always the best two out of 
three. The way I see it, you gotta 
get up. Get close to them, hold 
them tight, or they’ll throw you 
outta the ring.” 

“This is something that can’t 
be figured. There are some odds 
no one can live by. You’ll have to 
solve this one yourself.” 

He sat there, not moving. They 
were with him always, but some- 
times they weren’t much help. 

The plane would land on the 
other side of the continent. He 
had little money, but he could get 



in touch with Interplanet and 
they would advance him the fare 
back. Unfortunately, such a move 
would take time. There would be 
schedules to juggle, to say noth- 
ing of the ride back. A mere 
matter of hours on a fast ship — 
yet what if that was too long? 

H E got to his feet and went 
forward. “You can’t go in 
there,” said the stewardess. 

He looked past her into the 
pilot’s compartment. It was se- 
curely locked from this side 
though not on the other. He 
glanced down at the girl. It was 
a tradition that stewardesses were 
gorgeous creatures, though the 
tradition was simply not true any 
longer. In an age of space ex- 
ploration, air travel had dis- 
pensed with glamor. But for 
unfathomable reasons, this stew- 
ardess was a throwback to the old 
days. If she didn’t quite achieve 
real beauty, she came close 
enough so that no healthy male 
could conceivably object to her 
nearness. 

Merrol could take the keys 
away from her, but she’d scream 
and a dozen men would come 
leaping to her rescue. He didn’t 
care for the odds. 

He had met three women and 
had he misjudged the effect of 
the new himself on them? First 
Erica — her behavior had been 
strange, considering that, even 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX 



39 



from the first, she must have 
doubted he was her husband. 
Then the receptionist — she had 
gone out of her way to get him 
into Crander’s office when the 
latter was upset by the disap- 
pearance of a patient. And finally, 
the pathetic Miss Jerrems, who 
had thawed and would have de- 
scended to crooked schemes, had 
he encouraged her. Was this some 
form of pity or something quite 
different — or did it matter at all 
as long as they were not in- 
different? There was a way to 
find out. 

He raised his arm, the shorter 
one, and laid his hand affection- 
ately on the stewardess’ shoulder. 
“Isn’t there a private room in 
back?” 

She tilted her head and her 
lips glistened. “Yes, there is.” 
“Small enough for two?” 

“I believe so.” Her lashes trem- 
bled and lowered and she seemed 
surprised that they did. “That is 
if you — if we snuggled close.” 
“I’m sure we will. Why don’t 
you find out about that room?” 
“It ^seems like a good idea.” 
She blushed and turned to leave. 

“I’ll need keys, won’t I?” he 
said. 

She leaned against him and the 
keys dropped into his hand. “I’ll 
be waiting,” she whispered. He 
watched her walk down the aisle 
and enjoyed the enticing sway of 
her hips. Under other circum- 



stances, he might have consid- 
ered joining her. 

He had the keys! It had work- 
ed! He didn’t know why, nor 
did he have time to think about 
it. He inserted the key and step- 
ped inside. 

“Hi, Jane,” sang out the pilot, 
not turning, assuming he knew 
who it was. 

Merrol located the autopilot 
switch and, reaching past the 
man, turned it on. With the same 
motion he whirled the pilot 
around. “Listen, friend, don’t you 
want to go back?” 

“No. Why should I?” The pilot 
was startled, but not intimidated. 

“Engine trouble or something. 
You figure it out. I don’t care 
what it is, as long as we get 
back.” He half-hoped the man 
would object — physical action 
would be a relief. In an emer- 
gency, he could handle the ship 
himself — it was simpler than a 
spaceship. 

ri'iHE pilot squinted beyond and 
-J- behind him. “Engines don’t 
sound so good,” he muttered. He 
was unexpectedly docile. “Safety 
first is the motto of this airline.” 
It was a good rule, but it was 
questionable whose safety he was 
referring to. 

The pilot was still having un- 
accountable difficulty with his 
eyes — there was a marked tend- 
ency to cross. “Sure, we’ll go 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



back,” he said. “Glad you 
brought it to my attention. But 
call off your gang, will you, 
mister?” 

Merrol turned around. He was 
alone. There was no one behind 
him , though the pilot seemed con- 
vinced there was. 

He had a partial answer to the 
pilot’s strange reaction. He was a 
multiple personality and, norm- 
ally latent, in times of stress the 
multi-personality became domi- 
nant and impressed itself psy- 
chologically on the observer. 
And if the mind received the 
impression of several men, the 
eye tried hard to produce evi- 
dence that would confirm it. 

Not everyone was as successful 
at self-hypnosis as the pilot, but 
the temptation toward it was al- 
ways there. Now that he thought 
of it, men never had laughed at 
him. Instead they had been re- 
spectful. He apparently had an 
unsettling effect on those of his 
own sex he came in contact with 
— just how powerful it was, he 
didn’t know yet. The complete 
answer would have to await in- 
vestigation by trained psycholo- 
gists. 

Women were different. They 
invariably laughed first — Erica 
too, in spite of the general sym- 
pathy she must have felt for him. 
In what did the difference lie? 
That too he would have to de- 
termine — later. 



The pilot looked at him dizzily, 
beseechingly. Merrol decided he 
must be pouring it on, though 
he felt no different. “Remember, 
I can get up here in an awful 
hurry,” said Merrol, “so no 
tricks.” The pilot nodded and 
clung helplessly to the controls. 
He wouldn’t cause any trouble. 
Merrol raised his arm in a ges- 
ture. “Come on, fellows.” 

As an afterthought, he locked 
the stewardess in the private 
compartment and, as he did so, 
he could feel the plane swing in 
a wide arc that would take them 
to the station they had started 
from. The apathetic dozing pas- 
sengers didn’t even notice. 

And then all six of him walked 
back to his seat and Merrol sat 
down. 

VI 

H E slid out of the plane while 
it was still rolling. He didn’t 
want to argue with the passen- 
gers, when they found they were 
on the wrong coast and he was 
to blame. Nor did he particularly 
want to explain to the authorities. 
Later he would have to, but by 
then he would have powerful in- 
terests behind him to smooth over 
the incident. 

It was late and there were no 
cabs in sight, in air or on sur- 
face. He crossed the landing 
strip into the station and out of it 



THE MAN WHO WAS SIX

and swept along the dark streets 
with a loose-jointed stride that 
made the distance seem less than 
it was. Presently, he broke into 
a trot and his speed was en- 
couraging. 

A hoppicopter — one of the 
little surface cars that could rise 
and fly for a short time to avoid 
traffic jams — bounced down and 
rolled alongside. A window slid 
open and a head popped out. “In 
a hurry, mister?” 

He bobbed his head. “Hos- 
pital.” 

“Jump in and we’ll take you. 
We’re not doing anything special 
— just riding around.” The hop- 
picopter stopped. This was luck 
• — he’d get there faster. 

The man in the front seat 
opened the door and stepped out, 
flashing a light on him. “Just a 
check. We don’t mind taking you, 
but we want to be sure we don’t 
pick up some rough character.” 

The man didn’t look so gentle 
himself — and the light was train- 
ed on .Dan too long. If they were 
afraid, he’d have to refuse their 
offer and go on. 

“Hey, Carl,” the man with the 
flash called out puzzledly. 
“Haven’t we seen this guy some- 
where before?” 

He should have expected some- 
thing like this and not stopped — 
but maybe it would have been 
worse if he hadn’t. So far, he had 
been lucky that no one had spot- 



ted him — and now was not the 
time to be discussing terms with 
Interplanet. He began to edge 
away. 

Carl climbed out of the hop- 
picopter and circled in the same 
direction Merrol was inching to- 
ward. “I guess I have at that,” 
said Carl slowly. He was a big 
man. “Can’t say where, though.” 

Merrol breathed more easily. 
He couldn’t make a break for it, 
but perhaps he wouldn’t have to. 
They might not have seen the 
broadcast. “I’ve got to hurry,” 
he said. “I’ll go on.” 

“Don’t get sore,” said Carl 
soothingly. “We’ll take you. 
Climb in.” 

The man with the light was 
frowning indecisively. “The guy 
on the broadcast?” he asked 
sharply. 

“Nah,” said Carl disgustedly. 
“That guy — you look at his pic- 
ture and you have to bust out 
laughing. Now this fellow here — 
while he’s a long way from hand- 
some — is clearly the executive 
type, a man you can trust.” Carl 
scrutinized him thoughtfully. Be- 
fore Merrol could stop him, he 
reached out and plucked off the 
hat. “There’s only one guy with 
three-colored hair, though, and 
you’ve got it,” he said unbeliev- 
ingly. 

Merrol started to back away, 
but the body of the hoppicopter 
stopped him.

“Mister, you’ve sure got some 
disguise,” said the other man in 
an awed voice. “I could look 
right at you all day and not tell 
who it was.” 

I T was no disguise, it was the 
multi-personality again. No 
one looked quite the same in real 
life as in a picture, because the 
personality was missing. And 
with him the difference was far 
more marked. The camera could 
register his features accurately, 
but men couldn’t, not when he 
was actually there to inspire trust 
and respect — and he did arouse 
those emotions. Added together, 
these were some of the reasons 
why he hadn’t hitherto been rec- 
ognized. 

“Sorry to have bothered you,” 
he said, pushing between them 
as they converged on him. “I’m 
in a hurry.” 

“Sure, sure,” said Carl, apolo- 
getically, moving aside. 

“But he’s money!” the man 
with the flashlight cried in an 
anguished voice. 

“So he is!” said Carl. The vi- 
sion of money seemed to carry 
a lot of Weight with him. He 
seemed reluctant to act, but he 
reached out and swung Merrol 
around. “We’ll take you to In- 
terplanet and then you can go to 
the hospital. Don’t worry, we 
aren’t going to do nothing. It 
don’t pay us to hurt you.” 



Their original intentions were 
probably sincere, but now that 
they thought they’d found money 
on the street, they weren’t willing 
to let it go. But Merrol was not 
going to accompany them to In- 
terplanet. He jerked away. 

“We’ll split the reward,” said 
Carl. “Too bad we got to carry 
him in.” 

Merrol tried to exude .him, but 
Carl caught his arm in a bone- 
cracking hold. That is, it ought 
to have splintered bone. That it 
didn’t was not due to lack of 
skill, but to the proportions of 
the arm to which it was applied. 
The advantage of leverage went 
to Merrol and he used it. He 
broke loose and swung the long 
arm with the large fist and Carl 
went down. 

The man with the light drop- 
ped it, climbed on Merrol’s back 
and was pounding away at a 
nerve. Had he found the nerve, 
Merrol might have crumpled to 
the street. He didn’t find it, be- 
cause it wasn’t there. The nerve 
had been surgically rerouted. 

Merrol peeled him off and toss- 
ed him on top of Carl. He tossed 
him harder than he meant to and 
neither man moved. 

He climbed into the hoppicop- 
ter and rolled it through the dark 
streets. They had caused him to 
lose time and for this they would 
forfeit the use of their ’copter. 
They could pick it up in the

morning, if they felt like claiming 
it. He got out and hurried into 
the hospital. 

He met others in the corridors 
— it was a busy place in spite 
of the lateness — but the first per- 
son he recognized was Erica. 
“Dan!” she said. She didn’t use 
anything scientific, but the hold 
on him was harder to break than 
judo. Perhaps because he didn’t 
want to. 

Later, he became aware of 
someone tapping his shoulder. He 
turned around. “These things can 
be consummated in the privacy 
of one’s own home,” murmured 
Doctor Crander. “But when a 
life is at stake, passion should be 
put aside.” 

The purely physical elation be- 
gan to fade. He put Erica down, 
but uncertainly holding onto her. 
It was an ambivalent gesture. 
“Is this what you call an emer- 
gency?” he asked sarcastically. 
He had broken a number of 
minor laws and nearly his own 
neck in getting here. He had a 
right to be angry, though he was 
not sure how he felt. 

The doctor gave him a scanda- 
lized look. “Do you think we’re 
unethical? There is such a wo- 
man as we described, one of our 
staff. We do have other donors, 
but we think you can do more 
for her. In a fit of despondency, 
this woman wandered into the 
extraterrestrial room without the 



customary protection, hoping to 
catch something — and she did.” 
Crander frowned. “The only way 
we altered facts was to use your 
wife’s photo. It was her idea. 
Furthermore, it is true that a 
pretty girl gets a better response 
— and, of course, Erica wanted 
you back.” 

When he learned who the pa- 
tient was, he was satisfied with 
his decision. After the blood frac- 
tion had been administered to 
Miss Jerrems, even his untrained 
eyes could see the improvement. 

H E watched Erica suspiciously 
as she pattered about in a 
state of dishabille that did noth- 
ing to enhance her beauty but, 
perversely, made her more ex- 
citing. That she had been un- 
certain as to his identity the last 
time meant little and he could 
forgive it. Man and wife were 
not thereby distinct species, sep- 
arate to themselves, unattracted 
or repelled by all others of the 
opposite sex. For himself, he had 
only to remember the stewardess. 

But it was important to know 
what her true feelings toward 
him were. Laughter at the wrong 
time could be disastrous to a 
man’s ego! 

“This time, you know there’s 
no mistake,” he said, hoping that 
irony was some protection. “But 
are you sure you want me as a 
husband?”

She stopped fiddling with her 
hair. She tilted her head and 
looked at him, at a body that de- 
fied the laws of anatomy and the 
face that belonged on a clown— 
except that a clown could take 
his face off. “Are you trying to 
get rid of me?” She was asking 
questions, not answering them. 

Erica was examining him care- 
fully and he could tell that she, 
unlike a male, saw each feature 
distinctly, saw the nose that had 
belonged to someone else and 
looked it, the jaw, originally 
very fine, but with contours that 
had since melted out of shape. 

“I’m not trying to get rid of 
you,” he said. “Maybe you want 
somebody nicer.” He’d have to 
know before he could stop feeling 
tormented. 

“Nicer?” she echoed. “Do you 
want me to answer that?” 

S HE came and leaned against 
him. “A woman ought to have 
some secrets,” she murmured. 
“But if you have to know, the 



first time I saw you I laughed, 
because you are funny. And after 
that, well, I saw traces of the 
nicest features of nearly every 
man I ever had a crush on. That 
was just the physical side.” 

She rested her head on his 
shoulder. “I didn’t believe you 
actually were Dan. I didn’t pay 
attention to a thing you said.” 
“But if you didn’t believe . 
“Just what you’re thinking,” 
she answered. “I couldn’t help it. 
You’re the most exciting chal- 
lenge a woman can have. Even if 
she doesn’t know why, as I didn’t 
then, it’s still there — half a dozen 
men, and all of them in one 
monogamous package.” 

Now that she put it that way, 
he could see why she hadn’t been 
able to resist. He could see that 
there were few women who could. 
He glanced at a framed photo- 
graph of the handsome pre-ac- 
cident Dan Merrol that stood on 
the bureau. He thought, Poor 
sucker!

pull their tails,” said Em. “Now, 
C-A-T spells—” 

“Cat, cat, CAT!” he wailed, 



kicking his little heels on the 
floor. 

Em hesitated, then returned to 
her task. “Very well. The cat 
sat on the mat. M-A-T, Mat. 
And here’s a mat.” She held it 
up. “A real mat.” 

Paul sniffed contemptuously 
and, with a child’s unanswerable 
logic, said, “How can you say 
what a cat’s made for and what 
a cat’s not made for, if we haven’t 
got a cat?”

If Em had been human, she 
would have sighed. As it was, she 
wondered whether the child’s 
question was good or bad. It was 
good because it showed power 
of reasoning; bad because it 
might get in the way of his stud- 
ies. Helen now was different. She 
just listened and repeated the 
words, but Em was never sure 
whether she really understood. 

“Why can’t I have a real cal 
Em?” said Paul. “In the book, 
the boy’s got a cat. Why can’t 
I have a cat, a real alive cat, not 
one in a book? An alive cat, same 
as we’re alive.” 

I N the web of Em’s mind floated 
several thoughts. One was that 
she wasn’t really alive — not real- 
ly. And that brought the feeling 
of something a human would 
have called pain. It wasn’t pain, 
though, but something worse, be- 
cause a robot couldn’t feel pain. 
Another was that it was bad 
enough as it was, having to teach 
them from books showing child- 
ren in circumstances that they 
themselves knew nothing of ; hav- 
ing to avoid their questions, put- 
ting them off and off — 

“In the story Jay was reading 
me the other bedtime, they buyed 
a cat in a shop. Why can’t we 
buy a cat in a shop!” He screw- 
ed up his face and added in a 
plaintive little voice, “And how 
do you buy?” 



Really, thought Em, she would 
have to have a word with Jay 
and suggest that he be more care- 
ful about what he read to them. 
He was too good-natured, too 
easy-going. 

“How do you buy?” Paul said 
again, tugging at her metal knee- 
joint. 

“Well, it’s giving something for 
something else. Like ...” she 
floundered. It did involve giving 
something for something else. 
She’d heard the grownups men- 
tion it — in the days when there 
had been grownups. They had 
joked about it the way humans 
did joke, because here buying 
and — what was it? — selling had 
no meaning. 

“It isn’t important,” she said. 

“What’s important?” 

“That you learn your lessons.” 

“No, I mean what does im- 
portant mean?” 

“If you learn your lessons, 
you’ll learn what important 
means.” As she said it she real- 
ized it couldn’t be very convinc- 
ing, especially to a six-year-old. 
So she added hastily, “You’ll 
learn what all the long words 
mean, and then you’ll be able to 
read all the books there are. All 
the big books with long words in 
them.” 

To her surprise, the mention 
of big books did not brighten his 
eyes as it always had before. 

“They’re all lies!” he burst 



A START IN LIFE 



47 



out. “I don’t want to learn any- 
thing. They’re all lies about 
things that don’t happen. There 
ain’t such things as cats and trees 
and — and ...” He broke into 
bitter sobbing. 

“Not ain’t — aren’t,” said Em, 
cursing herself the next moment. 
As if that really mattered when 
there were only the four of them. 
She reached out a hand to com- 
fort him. But he shrugged it 
away. ■ 

“Come on,” she said, trying 
to modulate her voice like a 
human, trying to be soft and 
gentle and comforting and know- 
ing that she couldn’t manage it. 
“We do have trees, anyway.” 

He looked up, his face flushed 
and indignant. “They’re not 
trees,” he retorted vehemently. 
“They’re only a lot of old weeds. 
You can climb up real trees.” 

“I thought you said those were 
lies in the books about trees,” 
she said. This time she did man- 
age to get a whisper into her 
voice so that he would under- 
stand that she was only kidding 
him — she hoped. 

But he only burst into a re- 
newed fit of sobbing. 

“t |AHERE are trees,” she per- 
sisted. “Leastways, there 
have been trees. And there will 
be again.” She didn’t like to think 
what the odds were against that, 
so she didn’t. “I’ve seem them 



with my own eyes. You believe 
Em, don’t you?” She put out her 
hand again, and this time he did 
not reject it. He threw himself 
into her hard, cold, metallic lap. 

“Oh, Em,” he sobbed. “Oh, 
Em!” But his tears now were not 
the tears of anger and separation, 
but of union in a common loss, 
so that Em, too, might have wept 
had she been human. 

Instead she ran her clumsy, 
inadequate fingers through his 
damp blond hair, and said, 
“There, there" but this time it 
was far too loud and mechanical, 
so she stopped talking and 
cradled him in her arms, rocking 
him till his weeping subsided. 

She was still rocking him when 
Jay came back from the gardens 
with Helen. 

Bursting through the doorway, 
Helen yelled excitedly, “Look 
what I’ve got. A flower! A real 
flower!” 

“Ss-sh," said Em in a whisper 
like a steam valve going off. 

“Oh,” said Helen, “can’t I 
wake him to show him my 
flower?” She held the sickly yel- 
lowish bloom in front of her face. 

“No,” said Em, “he’s tired. I 
shouldn’t have given him an ex- 
tra lesson.” She turned to Jay. 
“What is this flower?” 

“It just grew, Em,” said Jay. 
“I found it in the beds along 
with the plants.” 

“Jay, is that the truth?” 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It wasn’t conscience that made 
Jay shake his head, but know- 
ing that Em knew the truth. “I — 

I planted a couple of seeds. One 
of the seed bags in the stores was 
split open and I found the seeds 
on the floor. It won’t do any 
harm, Em.” 

“I thought we agreed that 
nothing like that must be touch- 
ed. We don’t know what might 
happen.” 

“Don’t worry about it, Em. I 
read all about it in a book before 
I planted them. I thought the 
children ought to have something. 
They get so little — ” 

“Don’t you think it’s time to 
put the children to bed?” said 
Em wamingly. She noticed that 
Helen had hidden the pitiful 
flower behind her back. 

“Sure, sure,” said Jay. “But 
about these seeds, Em. I thought 
perhaps we could ...” 

He faltered. Neither robot had 
anything like facial muscles with 
which to express a meaning with- 
out words, but the way Em was 
looking at him now — head lower- 
ed, shining eyes leveled at him 
from beneath her rounded brow — 
was warning enough. 

“All right, Em. Let me have 
the boy. Come along, Helen. Bed- 
time.” 

But Helen did not turn. She 
looked up at Em. “I may keep 
the flower, Em, mayn’t I?” 

“Of course, Helen,” said Em 



after only a moment’s hesitation. 
If any harm had been done, it 
was done by now. “I’ll put some 
water in a glass and you can have 
it near your bed. How’s that?” 
“Oh, thank you, Em, thank 
you!” She rushed over and clasp- 
ed Em about the legs. Em lifted 
her gently up, but held her at 
arm’s length. Otherwise, she 
knew, the child would kiss her, 
for she was more demonstrative 
than the boy. And the thought 
that she was all in the nature of 
a mother the child had to kiss — 
only cold unyielding metal — 
made Em feel inadequate. And 
whether she was supposed to be 
able to feel that or not, she did — 
and too often. 

As she set Helen down, Em 
noticed the disappointed expres- 
sion that always came when she 
had to frustrate her childlike 
impulses. But the look she gave 
Em before she turned to follow 
Jay was somehow different from 
any Em had noticed before. 

E M stood there looking after 
her for quite a long time. 
In fact, she was still looking after 
her, standing in the same awk- 
ward, unhuman stance, when Jay 
returned. As he sat down, she sat 
down in the chair facing him. 
Sitting was another habit they’d 
long ago acquired from humans 
and not relinquished when the 
humans had died.

Jay stirred. “Helen didn’t want 
to hear a story tonight,” he said. 

“Oh?” she said. There was a 
long pause. 

“Em,” he said at last. “You’re 
not really mad at me, are you? 
About the flowers, I mean.” 

“I think you’re a fool, that’s 
all,” she said. “We can’t afford to 
take risks like that. Germs, 
spores — we just don’t know what 
might come from something 
new.” 

“But we inoculated them 
against everything, didn’t we? 
Don’t you remember, Em? Didn’t 
I hold them when you put the 
needle in?” 

“Oh, stop it,” she said crossly. 
Of course she remembered. How 
could she forget? Those first 
years when there had been so 
many things to remember from 
the last hurried instructions. How 
to change and bathe babies with 
hands that had never been made 
for it. How to nurse them through 
the childhood ailments that came 
in spite of all the inoculations. 
How to teach things that had 
never been taught to oneself, be- 
cause they’d either been unneces- 
sary or built in. 

Nervous breakdown couldn’t 
happen to a robot, because a 
robot’s system wasn’t like a 
human’s. But bringing up a hu- 
man baby was an almost hope- 
less task for a robot, Em thought. 
One mental image had become 



a recurring and fearful one — the 
fantastic image of herself explod- 
ing under the strain, of cogs and 
springs and synthetic brain-cells 
flying in all directions. 

^T'HAT was the image that 
came back now to frighten and 
confound her. 

It was different with Jay. She 
looked at him as he sat there, 
silent after the sharpness of her 
admonition. Her mind went back 
to the first days, the very first 
days before this great burden of 
responsibility had been laid upon 
them. 

How carefree it had been then! 
The way, for instance, the hu- 
mans had come to treat her and 
Jay like male and female. It was 
only coincidence that Jay’s pre- 
fix made a man’s name and hers 
a woman’s. Being an earlier 
model, which accounted for the 
alphabetical precedence, he was 
clumsier, bulkier, squarer, while 
she was neater, smaller, more 
agile and more smoothly shaped. 
More delicate of voice, too. But 
besides, she had a quicker in- 
tuition than his, a more gentle 
manner and certainly a greater 
tendency to worry. It had been 
he who had joined in the jokes 
of the men, trying to understand 
them, dancing clumsy dances to 
amuse everyone when spirits were 
low. Meanwhile, she had learned 
to cook, although it was no more 



50 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



part of her job than dancing was 
his. 

I N human company they had 
gradually assumed the posi- 
tions of man and wife — he boast- 
ing sometimes of being older and 
more experienced, she slyly point- 
ing out that that didn’t make him 
necessarily wiser. He, since the 
last human grownups had all 
gone, thinking more of making 
the children happy — she of keep- 
ing them safe. 

And, like a wife who knows she 
is more intelligent than her hus- 
band, she tried to use it by not 
demonstrating it too often. But 
now she felt she had to speak. 

“If anything ever happens to 
them we’ll be alone. I don’t think 
you properly realize just how 
delicate human beings are.” 

“Of course I do, Em.” 

“And not only in their bodies,” 
she went on, as if she hadn’t 
heard him. “You’ll have to be 
more careful what you read to 
them.” 

“Now what have I done?” 
“Don’t read them any stories 
about children having things they 
can’t have. Stick to fairy stories.” 
“But there aren’t many fairy 
stories. They know them all by 
heart by now. Anyway, humans 
wouldn’t have had these books 
for the children if they were bad 
for them, would they?” 

“Oh, oh, oh! Sometimes I won- 



der what goes on inside that big 
square head of yours. Don’t you 
see that it wouldn’t matter if 
they had their own mothers and 
fathers to tell them?” 

“Of course I see. I just didn’t 
think that — ” 

“Well, think, then,” she said 
sharply. 

He lowered his gaze. “I do 
think,” he said after a pause. 
Then he looked up and said, “I 
think, for instance, that before 
long we’ll just have to tell them. 
The truth, I mean.” 

“Why do you say that now?” 
she said, suddenly fearful. 

“Oh, just things they say some- 
times. The way they ask about 
the big door, the way their eyes 
stray toward it. Little things like 
that.” 

“I know,” Em said at length, 
“but I’m frightened. Frightened 
about how they’ll take it, about 
what knowing will do to them.” 
They were silent for long min- 
utes. Then Jay said, “Can’t we 
invent a fairy story? One big 
fairy story about everything, so 
that we never have to tell them 
the truth.” ^ 

Em laid her metal hand on his. 
“Dear Jay. Can you invent even 
a little fairy story?” 

He shook his head dumbly. 
“And neither can I,” said Em. 
“Even if we could, it wouldn’t 
last long. It would only be one 
long evasion, instead of the little

51

evasions we make now. And any- 
how, in two or three years they’ll 
have the strength to open the big 
doors themselves. And we won’t 
be able to stop them. They’ve 
got to learn by then. They should 
understand enough of the little 
truths so that the big truth won’t 
be too great a shock to them.” 
‘‘Well, for my part,” said Jay, 
“I don’t see how learning that 
C-A-T spells Cat or that two 
and two bolts make four would 
prepare them.” 

“Of course you wouldn’t,” she 
said and her tone was sharp 
again. Because she knew that, in 
his simple, direct way, he had 
come closer to the truth than she 
cared to admit. “It’s a question 
of developing their minds. Dis- 
ciplining them. Preparing them.” 
“It was only a thought,” said 
Jay hastily. “You know best, Em. 
You always do.” 

B UT it became evident to Em 
before very long that one 
couldn't teach the small truths 
if one kept dodging the big one 
all the time. For the children’s 
growing puzzlement blocked their 
will to learn. 

They were still struggling 
through the first-year lessons of 
a five-year-old. Em studied the 
teaching manuals through the 
long hours while the children were 
asleep, trying to perfect herself 
as a teacher, trying to find out 



where she had gone wrong. 

Their minds were keen enough. 
Their questions didn’t abate. 
They became more subtle, more 
suddenly sprung in the attempt 
to get past the tightening mesh 
of their guardians’ evasions. And 
it became increasingly clear to 
Em that each evasion was a step 
backward. 

She tried answering their ques- 
tions in meaningless polysyllables 
and, when they pressed for ex- 
planations, telling them that there • 
was no easier way of putting it, 
that only by learning would they 
be able to understand. That de- 
vice she gave up for they soon 
came to see through it. She could 
tell by the look that came into 
their faces — the by now familiar 
look of hurt mistrust. 

The crux came when Paul ask- 
ed a question she just couldn’t 
avoid answering. It was a ques- 
tion that every child asks his 
mother sooner or later, but Em 
didn’t know that. Her awkward- 
ness when he suddenly asked her 
in the middle of a tediously slow 
arithmetic lesson, “Em, where 
did I come from?” was not of the 
same kind that an ill-prepared 
mother might feel. But it was 
awkward, none the less. 

Her first impulse was to hedge, 
telling him not to ask general 
questions during class. But one 
look at his anxious little face 
stopped her. She was also aware 



A START IN LIFE 



53 




of Helen’s gaze upon her, a half- 
smile on her lips, but the rest of 
her face set, obdurate — and yes, 
accusing. 

“Why,” she said, “well . ” 

Jay was there and she looked 
at him for help, even knowing 
that he could not give it. The 
helpless gesture he made with his 
hands was unnecessary. 

“Helen says,” said Paul, “that 
a big machine made us. She says 
that sometimes she can hear it 
throbbing. She says that when it’s 
throbbing it’s making babies.” 

Oh, no, thought Em, not this! 
This wasn’t right at all. They 
couldn’t be allowed to think like 
that. Machines were not the mas- 
ters. Men made machines. A ma- 
chine could never make men. But 
how else could they be expected 
to think? Wasn’t it natural when 
they knew no other humans, when 
two machines controlled their 
lives? 

“Do you believe that, Helen?” 
she asked. But Helen only drop- 
ped her eyes. 

“And you, Paul, do you believe 
that?” 

“I don’t know what to believe.” 

“Have you ever heard ma- 
chines, Paul?” 

Helen broke in. “I don’t hear 
them, I feel them. I feel them 
throb, throb, throbbing.” She 
stopped abruptly, dropping her 
gaze again. 

“But you both know that 



they’re just the machines that 
give us our air and light and 
everything. They’re buried down 
and down. They just go on work- 
ing away like all good machines.” 

“Then, if machines didn’t make 
us,” said Paul, “where did we 
come from? We must have come 
from somewhere. Somewhere 
where there’s trees and cats and 
— and other boys and girls.” His 
shrill little voice mounted. “Why 
do you keep us locked away from 
them?” 

“What?” said Em, startled. 
How could she begin to tell them 
the truth, if that was what they 
thought? 

“Why can’t we ever join them 
and play in the trees with them? 
Why do you keep the big door 
locked all the time?” His eyes 
filled with tears, but he did not 
cry aloud, It was that fact, that 
he did not cry, that decided Em 
more than anything else. 

“I’ll tell you,” she said. She 
took one look at Jay. He nodded 
once, slowly. Even Jay saw there 
was no avoiding it this time. 

ri^HE children’s eyes widened. 

They looked at each other 
and back to Em. 

“Before I begin,” said Em, 
“you must promise to be brave. 
You will hear things you did not 
expect. You were each made by 
a mother and a father. Jay and I 
are only here to see that you grow 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



up well and strong and clever. 
Your father and mother, Paul, 
and yours, Helen, are dead. Once 
there were twenty people here 
and they are all dead now.” 

“We know what that means,” 
said Helen. “Not alive — like the 
mat and the chair. But where are 
they? Why aren’t they here, even 
if they are dead?” 

Em realized with something 
like relief that they had no real 
conception of death. Perhaps it 
wouldn’t be so difficult, after all. 
That could be explained later, 
when it had been revealed to 
them why it was so important to 
be alive. Or would they think it 
important after she told them 
what she had to tell them? 

“Because the dead have no 
place with the living. That is, 
except in their thoughts. Jay and 
I often think of your parents and 
the others with them. Don’t we, 
Jay?” 

“Eh? Oh, yes, yes.” 

“Because they made us, too,” 
went on Em. “Well, not your 
actual mothers and fathers, but 
other clever people like them. 
We’re grateful and happy that 
they made us. That’s why we’re 
happy to look after you. And 
that’s why you must try to be as 
clever as they were.” 

The children looked puzzled. 
“You mean,” piped Paul, “so 
that we can make people like 
you?” 



“I didn’t mean that,” said Em. 
“You will have to make others 
like yourselves.” 

“But we couldn’t do that,” 
said Helen, aghast. “We’re not 
clever enough.” 

“I don’t think,” said Em, “that 
you’ll need to be clever to do 
that when the time comes. There 
are other reasons for you to be 
clever.” She rose, crossing to the 
big door. “Come with me,” she 
said. 

T HEY stood looking after her 
for a moment, not believing 
their eyes. Then they rushed after 
her shouting excitedly. 

“Em’s going to take us out- 
side.” 

“Can we climb the trees, Em?” 
“Are there shops there?” 

She turned, one metal hand on 
the bolt, looking down at them as 
they skipped about her legs. 

“There aren’t any trees out 
there. Nor shops.” 

They looked up at her in 
shocked surprise, suddenly mo- 
tionless. 

“Then — it is all lies in the 
books?” said Paul slowly. 

“No, it’s not lies. It’s just that 
we haven’t got them. They’re in 
the past.” 

“You mean like the fairy 
stories? Once upon a time? All 
once upon a time?” 

And Helen said, “There’s just 
nothing?” 



A START IN LIFE 



55 



Em faced Jay as she said slow- 
ly, “I told you that you would 
hear things you did not expect. 
Are you really sure you want to 
go on?” 

She looked from one to the 
other. She had expected them to 
be frightened. But she’d under- 
estimated the effect on them of 
living all their lives in one con- 
fined space, their wonder at be- 
ing able to step out of it at last. 

“Yes. Please, Em,” said Helen. 

“Yes, Em,” said Paul. 
“Please.” 

As she slid the bolt back she 
had the same feeling as when the 
last humans had died. The feel- 
ing of inadequacy. The disquiet- 
ing knowledge that when one was 
dealing with inanimate objects 
two and two made four and noth- 
ing else, but when one was deal- 
ing with humans, even little 
humans — especially little humans 
— the answer might be something 
entirely different. 

She slid the door open. The 
dimly lit passages confronted 
them. 

“Oh!” they cried, sounding dis- 
appointed. 

“Come along,” she said quick- 
ly. She took their hands. Then 
she saw that Jay had not come 
to the door with them. He hung 
back, awkwardly. “Aren’t you 
coming, Jay?” 

“Oh, sure, sure,” he said and 
lumbered after them. 



“No pranks, now,” said Em to 
the children. “Keep hold of my 
hands.” 

As they walked down the cor- 
ridor Helen said, “I feel it.” 

“I feel it, too, now,” said Paul. 
The slight vibration of the en- 
gines increased. They passed 
down a short flight of steps. “Now 
I hear it,” said Helen. 

“Now you see it,” said Em as 
they turned a bend. 

A ND there were the engines, 
the great engines, purring 
and purring, the lights winking 
over the panels. 

“Oooh!” breathed the boy. 
“Look at that great wheel spin- 
ning.” 

“That’s the one that supplies 
us with air,” said Em. 

Paul took a deep breath. “It 
smells funny here.” 

“That’s ozone,” Em said. 
“What’s ozone?” 

“I’m not siue,” said Em. “It’s 
some special kind of air. It’s all 
explained in the books. All about 
how to stop the machines and 
how to start them and how to 
make them go faster. You should 
see them when they’re really go- 
ing. They’re only ticking over 
now. But, my, when they really 
cut loose it’s wonderful.” 

“Why, what do they do then, 
Em?” 

It was going right, she thought. 
They would understand, because 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



now they would want to. 

“Come along,” she said, “and 
I’ll show you.” She led them 
along the walk to the control 
room. But there she felt doubt 
return. Her hand hesitated on 
the switch. And then, because she 
knew there was no turning back 
now, she pressed it. 

The children gasped and fell 
back a step, stumbling, fearing 
they would fall. Em laid her 
hands upon their shoulders. 
“There, it’s all right,” she said. 

The screen seemed to curve 
above and beneath and all around 
them. It was as if they were sus- 
pended in the breathing heart of 
the Universe. But because the 
children had no notion of the 
word Universe, this being the first 
time they had even seen the stars, 
to them it was like floating in a 
great dream, a great and wonder- 
ful dream. 

It was Paul who, after many 
moments, broke the silence. And 
then he only whispered the one 
word, “Stars!” and he was not 
speaking to Helen or Em or Jay 
— or even to himself. He was ad- 
dressing them, the stars. 

“They’re diamonds,” said 
Helen. “Like in the story. Dia- 
monds and rubies and emeralds. 
Reach out and get one for me, 
Em, so I can hold it in my hand.” 

“I can’t,” said Em. “How far 
away do you think they are?” 
realizing even as she asked it 



that the question could have no 
meaning for them. 

But Helen was too excited to 
pursue that one. “Look,”' she 
said. “Look at that great big 
cloud.” 

In the infinitely clear depths 
of infinite space it was like a 
cloud. It couldn’t have been any- 
thing but a cloud to a child who 
had never seen the skies of Earth. 
But the teacher in Em could not 
help saying, “That’s a nebula.” 
But Helen did not hear her. She 
danced up and down, clapping 
her hands. “That’s my cloud. I’m 
going to find a wonderful name 
for it. What about you, Paul? Do 
you want that big blue star and 
red star together?” 

But Paul had turned away 
puzzledly from the screen. 
“What is it, Paul?” Em asked. 
“I’m just wondering,” he said. 
“Wondering what?” 

“Why you had to keep this 
away from us all this time.” 
“Because ...” Em faltered. 
“Because I didn’t know whether 
you were ready for it.” 

“Ready?” he said, and though 
his voice asked a question, his 
tone held a strange confidence. 
“But why not?” Helen, too, 
turned away from the screen to 
look puzzled. 

H eavens, thought Em, had 

all those precautions been 
unnecessary, then? She had only 



A START IN LIFE 



57 



been carrying out instructions 
as best she could. And her own 
reasoning had told her they were 
wise ones. But had they been? 
Perhaps she and the parents alike 
had overestimated the dangers. 
Perhaps because they had known 
what it was like to have a wide 
world under one’s feet, they had 
not understood that it would not 
be the same for children born in 
space. But no, she told herself. 
They don’t know all of it yet. 

And then she told them. 

How this was the first starship 
and probably the last for a long, 
long time, because starships 
couldn’t be made every day of 
the week to launch into space. 
Nor could men and women be 
found so easily to volunteer for 
the years of journeying that it 
entailed — the years of journey- 
ing and possibly never arriving, 
possibly dying before reaching 
their goal, but having children 
before they died, so that the 
children would carry on. 

And how it had gone wrong. 
How they had died too soon. How 
the disease had struck the first 
generation before they were far 
out in interstellar space — too far 
out to return. How unknown 
radiations had produced an un- 
known germ that had stricken all 
the adults, attacking their ner- 
vous systems. How this had 
broken out not long before the 
two children had been born. And 



how Em helped as best she could 
at the births because there had 
been so few of the crew left by 
then, and those that were still 
alive had been stricken by the un- 
controllable palsy that was the 
herald of death. 

And then the mothers had died, 
and the other remnants of the 
crew. And they died, not quite 
without hope now. Not quite. 

Em suddenly realized, in the 
middle of telling it, that talk of 
stars and starships could have 
little meaning for the children. 
So she digressed to explain some- 
thing of what she knew of the 
Universe, of its vast depths and 
distances, of how great a venture 
it was to be crossing them. 

She explained that this was 
why she and Jay had to watch 
over them so carefully, why she 
and Jay had to teach them to 
read and understand the books, 
so that they would be able to 
carry on the great venture. Be- 
cause one day the ship would 
have to be piloted down to a new 
world. She and Jay couldn’t do 
that unaided. 

Jay told them the original pur- 
pose for which they had been 
brought along — to navigate the 
ship under the stresses of land- 
ing — and the stresses of that first 
takeoff from Earth. That, and 
to explore any worlds that might 
be difficult for humans to ex- 
plore. But they couldn’t do it 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



without the help of humans to 
plan and direct. 

J AY was silent. Em also waited 
silently. That was too much 
to ask of the children all at once. 
So they just waited. 

Paul spoke first and his words 
seemed strangely irrelevant. He 
turned to Em. “Then you don’t 
die — you and Jay?” 

“Why, no,” she answered. “We 
go on looking after you and then 
after the children you will have. 
We just go on and on, like all 
good machines.” Now, she could 
admit the difference between 
them. It was better this way. 

“You’re not machines,” said 
Helen stoutly. “You’re too wise 
to be machines.” 

“Well, we’re wise machines, 
then,” Em said, and then, think- 
ing they were getting off the sub- 
ject, “so, you see, that’s why 
there aren’t any trees or cats or 
other children. They’re too far 
away, like the stars.” 

“Which one of those stars is 
Earth?” said Paul. The word 
sounded odd on his lips. 

“You can’t see Earth from 
here,” said Em. “It’s much too 
far away. Besides, it isn’t a star. 
It’s a planet going around a star.” 
“Which star?” said Paul, and 
Em realized that she didn’t know. 

“I’ll look it up in the charts,” 
she said hastily, hoping she could 
read them correctly, “and then 



I’ll point it out to you. How’s 
that?” 

“Could you see all this,” said 
Helen, “back on Earth?” 

“Oh, no, never like this. Half 
the time you couldn’t see it at 
all because the Sun was too 
bright.” 

Paul excitedly said, “But then 
it’s only just a long way away. 
Back on Earth there’s trees and 
cats and all those things. And — 
children just like us seeing them 
every day. Why, right now . .” 
“But there were other things,” 
Em said quickly. “Bad things 
as well. Things we’re free of here, 
thank goodness.” 

“What bad things?” said 
Helen. “Like being dizzy because 
of going around and around all 
the time?” 

“No,” said Em. “Nobody ever 
got dizzy from that. We’re travel- 
ing at a great speed now, but we 
don’t get dizzy, do we? No, but 
believe Em, there were bad things 
— lots of them.” A sudden 
thought struck her. “Otherwise 
your parents and the others 
wouldn’t have wanted to leave 
Earth, would they?” 

“No,” admitted Paul, but he 
didn’t seem very convinced. 

I T was Jay — Jay who had been 
silent most of the time for 
fear of upsetting things — who 
said impulsively, “Don’t you see? 
They just got tired of going 



A START IN LIFE 



59 



around and around the same little 
star all the time. They didn’t get 
giddy, they just got tired of it, 
sick and tired. And they didn’t 
want that for their children. They 
wanted to give them a better life, 
a real start in life — ” 

He stopped as abruptly as he 
had begun. He turned away as if 
fearing he had said the wrong 
thing. 

Em touched his square shoul- 
der. One look at the children’s 
faces told her that he had said 
the right thing, the supremely 
right thing. Jay turned back and 
Em nodded, her hand still resting 
gratefully on his shoulder. 

Paul said, “And when we get 
to a new world, will there be trees 
and cats?” 

“There might be trees,” said 
Em. “There might be cats.” She 



had heard the humans discus- 
sing these things. “There might 
be — anything.” 

She felt a sudden pang of guilt. 
Was it right not to tell them the 
rest? She started to, then checked 
herself. No, the crisis had been 
met and surmounted. That was 
the important thing now. 

“Anything?” said Paul. 

“Giants, even?” said Helen, 
her eyes round with wonder. 
“Wizards? Fairy castles?” 

“Yes,” said Em, “there might 
be all of those and more. Noth- 
ing guaranteed, mind you, but 
anything is possible. Anything 
at all.” 

And so she did not add that it 
wouldn’t be for another hundred 
and twenty years. That could be 
told later.

THE SOUTHERN CROSS 



I F science fiction, as one defini- 
tion has it, is literature based 
on known scientific facts and the 
extrapolation of accepted scien- 
tific theories, one of the great 
works of world literature has to 
be classified as science fiction — 
or at least a small portion of 
one of its three parts. I am speak- 
ing of Dante’s Divina Commedia. 
In Part II, Purgatorio, there are 
a few lines that have intrigued 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

scientists for a long time. As im- 
portant a personage as Alexander 
von Humboldt devoted a section 
of one of his books ( Examen 
critique de l’histoire de geo- 
graphic, vol. IV, Paris, 1836) to 
a searching appraisal of these 
lines. 

Since quite a number of read- 
ers know Italian (as well as the 
fact there is an Italian edition of 
this magazine), I’ll give the orig- 
inal wording first and follow it 
with the English translation : 

Jo nu volsi a man destra, e post mente 
All’ altro polo, e vidi quattro stelle 
Non viste mal fuor ch’alla prima gente, 
Goder pareva il ciel di lor fiammelle, 

0 settentrional vedovo sito 

Poi che privato se’ di mirar quelle I 

At right, in the direction of the south- 
ern pole 

1 saw the lights of a quadruple star 
Which the first couple only was to see. 
The heavens gloried in its radiation, 
O you poor widowed barren North, 
You never see the marvel of this con- 
stellation! 

SOMEBODY who does not 
^ know the background might 
dismiss these lines with the re- 
mark “Well, why not?” or words 
to that effect. The point here is 
that the dates involved do not 
seem to match in a spectacular 
manner. 

Dante began the Divina Corn- 
media in 1307; the above lines 
were written about ten years 
later. They unmistakably refer 
to the constellation now called 



the Southern Cross. But the 
Southern Cross was “discovered” 
by the Venetian explorer Alvise 
da Cadamosto, sailing for Prince 
Henry of Portugal, in 1455! 

To make the case even more 
mysterious, Dante stated that 
“the first couple,” meaning Adam 
and Eve, could see it. They were 
supposed to have lived in the 
Euphrates Valley, from which the 
Southern Cross is not visible, not 
now and not in Dante’s time. But 
theological reasoning put the 
creation of the world and the 
time of Adam and Eve at about 
6,000 years ago — and, at that 
time, the Southern Cross could 
be seen from the Euphrates Val- 
ley in present-day Iraq and even 
from points in Central Europe! 

How could Dante know these 
things? 

For a man of his time, he trav- 
eled a great deal, but mostly to 
the north of his native Florence. 
Even if he had gone as far south 
as is possible in Italy, he could 
not have seen it, for the toe of 
the Italian boot just touches the 
38th parallel of northern latitude 
and, in order to see the Southern 
Cross at all, one has to be south 
of the 30th parallel of northern 
latitude. To see it clearly in the 
sky some distance above the hori- 
zon, one has to be south of the 
15th parallel of northern latitude. 

This means that Dante should 
have had to travel at least to 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Upper Egypt or to the southern 
portions of the Red Sea and the 
Arab peninsula. For good visi- 
bility, he should have had to go 
to Ethiopia or to Ceylon. (For 
corresponding areas in the West- 
ern Hemisphere, one needs a trip 
to Mexico or Cuba to see the 
constellation at all, and to Nica- 
ragua or the Canal Zone for a 
good view.) 

T HE fact that Dante obviously 
had not seen the Southern 
Cross himself accounts for his ex- 
aggeration, because the Southern 
Cross is a comparatively small 
constellation that does not meas- 
ure up at all against the Big 
Dipper or Orion. Nor is it a par- 
ticularly good cross — the two 
arms do not form a right angle 
and the effect is marred by the 
presence of a fifth star. 

Interestingly enough, it took 
some time until it was even re- 
ferred to as a cross. Its “discov- 
erer” Cadamosto did not call it 
a cross and Amerigo Vespucci 
referred to it as “rhombus.” Even 
the intensely religious Dante him- 
self merely spoke, as we have 
seen, of the quattro stelle, the 
“four stars.” 

What makes the whole case 
so intriguing is that Dante’s lines 
are literally the earliest mention 
of the constellation. 

At the time of Homer (about 
800 B.C.), the Southern Cross 



was still visible from the Medi- 
terranean, but low on the horizon. 
It cannot have been conspicuous 
because the Odyssey — which, in 
one section now referred to as 
“Kalypso’s sailing instructions,” 
goes into constellations for navi- 
gational purposes with great de- 
tail — does not mention it at all. 
Nor did Ptolemy. At the time he 
lived in Alexandria, the star 
alpha of the Southern Cross still 
climbed to a little more than six 
degrees of arc above the horizon 
of his city. But' he seems to have 
added it to the constellation of 
Centaurus. 

The only place where it was 
probably mentioned as a separate 
constellation is in the Bible, in 
the Book of Job (9:9) where Job 
says that the Lord “maketh the 
Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades and 
the Chambers of the South.” At 
the time this book originated (4th 
century B.C.), the Cross was still 
visible from southern Palestine, 
but the term “chambers of the 
south” is obviously no helpful 
description to somebody who did 
not know it in the first place. 

B UT while Dante could not 
have derived his information 
from older books, which were si- 
lent on this point, there were 
other sources for such knowledge. 
It is known that soon after the 
year 1200, an Arab by the name 
of Caissar ben Abucassan had a 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



63 



globe of the sky made in Egypt, 
on which the Southern Cross was 
entered. A later globe — made in 
1279 — also of Arab origin, is still 
in existence. It is known further- 
more that Emperor Frederick II 
of Hohenstaufen acquired an 
Arab tent in 1229 that was a 
revolving map of the sky (actual- 
ly the first known planetarium), 
although no details exist. 

In addition to these globes and 
star maps, there were enough peo- 
ple in Dante’s time, mostly Arabs 
but also Europeans, who had 
traveled to places where the 
Southern Cross is clearly visible. 

One thing indicating that 
Dante relied on an eyewitness 
story is that, immediately follow- 
ing the lines quoted, he says he 
glanced back to the north “where 
the Wain had disappeared.” 

As everybody knows from per- 
sonal experience, the “Wain” 
(Big Dipper) is the most con- 
spicuous constellation of the 
northern sky. Europeans always 
felt uneasy when they came to 
areas where their main “sky 
mark” was no longer visible. 
The soldiers of Alexander the 
Great are the earliest men known 
to have complained about this. 
Even Marco Polo, who does not 
seem to have had any interest 
in the sky and never mentioned 
it, succumbed at one point by 
saying that Polaris cannot be seen 
from Sumatra. 



Though Dante could (and ob- 
viously did) find out about the 
existence and appearance of the 
Southern Cross, it is hard to 
see where he could have learned 
about the visibility of that con- 
stellation in higher northern lati- 
tudes at an earlier period. 

True, the precession of the 
equinoxes responsible for this 
phenomenon had been discov- 
ered long before him by Hip- 
parchos of Nicaea, but later 
astronomers had paid little atten- 
tion to it. In fact, only the Arabs 
seem to have believed in what is 
now called “trepidation of the 
equinoxes,” a wrong theory that 
assumed the precession would ac- 
cumulate and then swing back. 

Dante, of course, did not have 
to decide which theory was right. 
He only had to learn somewhere 
that astronomers knew of a 
steady displacement of the stars 
in the sky. He might then simply 
have been convinced that one of 
the attributes of Eden had been 
to see all the stars in the sky. 

But whether he reasoned on 
the foundations of a then current 
theory or simply guessed, it so 
happened that he was right!

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Paz, director of the Institute 
of Meteoritics at Albuquerque, 
New Mexico, are engaged in a 
project that more than fifty years 
ago was half-heartedly started 
in Europe, but then petered out 
for lack of success and financial 
support. This time, the support 
comes from the U. S. Ordnance 
Department. As for the probable 
chances of success, with the much 
better instrumentation now avail- 
able, they might have had some 
between the writing and the pub- 
lication of this column. 

The project: To find out 

whether Earth has more than one 
moon. 

As mentioned in the opening 
sentence, the problem is not ex- 
actly new. My own teacher, in 
fact, was fond of saying that his 
teacher used to say that his 
teacher considered it highly 
probable that Earth might have 
several tiny moons. Possibly, he 
added, Earth might even have a 
very faint ring. And the man 
who made this statement, the 
astronomer M. Wilhelm Meyer, 
asserted in turn that he was more 
or less quoting casual opinions 
of his teacher, Prof. E. F. W. 
Klinkerfues. Since Klinkerfues 
died in 1884, this succession of 
opinions has carried us back quite 
far, but not to the beginning of 
the idea, which originated in 
France nearly a century ago. 

The original paper by one F. 



Petit of Boulogne may be classi- 
fied as “forgotten,” but the idea 
was not because Jules Verne read 
it (or read about it) one day and 
utilized it in his second novel 
about the cannon-shot to the 
Moon. 

This book, entitled Autour de 
la Lune, appeared in 1870, five 
years later than the first book, 
De la Terre a la Lune. If you 
have read it, you might remem- 
ber that the three inhabitants of 
the Moon projectile — Barbicane, 
Nicholl and Ardan — have man- 
aged to recover from the shock 
of the firing. Since they, in Jules 
Verne’s opinion, cannot tell 
whether they are moving or not 
— actually they could not pos- 
sibly miss the sensation of being 
in free-fall — they look out of the 
window to see whether they are 
in space. 

When Barbicane was about to leave 
the window his attention was attracted 
by the approach of a brilliant object. 
It was an enormous disk the colossal 
dimensions of which could not be esti- 
mated. Its face which was turned in 
the direction of the Earth was very 
bright. One might have thought it a 
small moon reflecting the light of the 
large one. It approached with a high 
velocity and seemed to travel in an 
orbit around the Earth which would 
intersect that of the projectile . The 
object passed several hundred yards 
from the projectile and disappeared. 

In response to a surprised re- 
mark made by Michel Ardan, 
Mr. Barbicane launched into one

of his usual short lectures: 

“It is a simple meteorite, but an 
enormous one, retained as a satellite by 
the attraction of the Earth . But 
this second moon is so small and its 
velocity so great that the inhabitants 
of Earth cannot see it. It was by no- 
ticing disturbances that a French as- 
tronomer, Monsieur Petit, could de- 
termine the existence of this second 
moon and calculate its orbit. According 
to him a complete revolution around 
the Earth takes three hours and twenty 
minutes.” 

“Do all astronomers admit the ex- 
istence of this satellite?” asked Nicholl. 

“No,” replied Barbicane, “but if, like 
us, they had met it they could no 
longer doubt it . But this gives us a 
means to determine our position in 
space; its distance is known and we 
were, therefore, 4650 miles above the 
surface of our globe when we met it.” 

It is this encounter, Jules 
Verne explained, that made the 
projectile deviate from its trajec- 
tory and miss the Moon, to the 
great good fortune of the travel- 
ers. 

Since 1870, the story, in various 
languages, has been read by per- 
haps five million people. At least 
one hundred professional astron- 
omers must have been among 
those five million. Yet it took 
until 1952 before somebody no- 
ticed that Jules Verne’s figures 
for distance and period of revolu- 
tion do not jibe. 

It was Dr. Robert S. Richard- 
son of Mt. Wilson Observatory 
who did, but what he really want- 
ed to check was whether the 
gravitational field of the second 



moon would be strong enough 
to deflect the projectile from its 
path. (It wouldn’t.) In looking 
for clues to the size of the second 
moon, he noticed the discrepancy. 
(See: Bull. Pacific Rocket Soc. 
Vol. 5, No. 10; Oct., 1952.) Either 
the period was three hours and 
20 minutes, when the distance 
from the surface would have to 
be 3,114 miles, or else the dis- 
tance was 4,650 miles, when the 
period would have to be four 
hours and 30.7 minutes. 

This goes for orbits that are 
circular or very nearly so, as 
implied by Jules Verne. Of 
course, if Petit had an elliptical 
orbit in mind, both figures can be 
true. The body might have an 
orbital period of three hours and 
20 minutes and reach the distance 
of 4,650 miles at one point of its 
orbit. Nothing is actually said 
about the size of the satellite, but 
the idea seems to have been that 
it was at least a mile in diameter. 

W E can be certain that a sec- 
ond moon of Earth of the 
type postulated by Petit and 
popularized by Jules Verne does 
not exist. 

If it did, it would take one 
hour and 21 minutes to cross the 
sky from horizon to horizon, in- 
cidentally rising in the west and 
setting in the east. Not quite half 
of that time, it would be invisible 
inside the Earth’s shadow. But, 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



while rising, it would be above 
the horizon for 23 minutes before 
it entered the shadow and it 
would need another 23 minutes 
from leaving the shadow until it 
disappeared below the horizon on 
the other side. 

Even if its surface, like that of 
the Moon, were quite dark (think 
of lava or dark slate for the 
proper color value), the satellite 
would reflect enough sunlight to 
look like a very bright star and 
a careful observer could actually 
see it move. 

If Earth had a second satellite 
like that, its existence would have 
been known since the days of the 
Babylonians. This would still be 
true even if it were twenty times 
as far away as postulated. A one- 
mile satellite would be visible to 
the naked eye at a distance of 
100,000 miles. It would be faint, 
certainly, but one would notice 
that this faint star does not oc- 
cupy the same position among 
the fixed stars that it did an hour 
ago. 

Even cutting down its size to a 
mere five per cent of a mile, the 
satellite would be likely to be 
known if it were near enough. A 
satellite of that size (again as- 
suming that its surface is as 
dark as lava) would still be vis- 
ible to the naked eye at a distance 
of 1000 miles. It would no longer 
be a conspicuously bright star, 
but it would give itself away by 



its fast movement. 

If this 'l/20th-of-a-mile satel- 
lite revolved at a distance of 
10,000 miles, it would have re- 
mained undiscovered prior to the 
invention of the telescope. But it 
certainly would have been found 
during the last hundred years, 
because it would show in any 
good portable instrument. 

All of this implies that a second 
satellite of Earth, to escape dis- 
covery until now, would have to 
be small, less than a hundred 
feet in diameter. At that size, it 
would be too small to be seen 
without a telescope. Even with a 
telescope, it would be too faint 
to be conspicuous. 

One has to bear in mind that 
an observer usually looks for a 
specific thing and may therefore 
pay little attention to other ob- 
jects. Besides, in telescopic ob- 
servations, the field of vision is 
small. Something quite spectacu- 
lar could be going on just “out- 
side the telescope” and not be no- 
ticed as long as it is invisible 
to the unaided eye. This applies 
to direct observation. 

The widespread use of photog- 
raphy in astronomical work im- 
poses another condition for still 
undetected satellites. They-must 
not only be small — they must 
also be near, so that they move 
fast. If they do that, they may 
escape detection by appearing to 
be something else.

A NY telescope of reasonably 
large size, with or without 
photographic attachment, is mov- 
ed by a clockwork mechanism 
“to follow the stars” — more pre- 
cisely, to compensate for the ro- 
tation of the Earth. This means, 
of course, that the mechanism 
compensates for the apparent 
movements of objects that rise in 
the east and set in the west. 

But a near satellite would seem 
to go the other way across the 
sky. 

It would not only be quite fast 
by itself; it would appear even 
faster because the telescope 
moves in the opposite direction. 
The inevitable result is that such 
a satellite, accidentally photo- 
graphed, would leave a trail from 
edge to edge of the plate. But 
so does every bright meteor. 

While a meteor trail across a 
plate is of some casual interest, 
not much lasting attention would 
be paid to it. In the first place, 
the picture has been taken for 
another purpose. In the second 
place, a photograph of a meteor 
track, unless taken with a special 
camera and preferably with two 
cameras simultaneously, teaches 
very little. 

In short, the hypothetical sa- 
tellite track would be mistaken 
for a meteor track. Even if some- 
body was suspicious, there would 
hardly be a way of proving the 
suspicion. 



Just how Drs. La Paz and 
Tombaugh will try to catch the 
minor satellite (s) has not been 
disclosed. But the principle is 
fairly obvious. Although such a 
small satellite could have an orbit 
lying in any position compared 
with the ecliptic — the orbit of the 
Earth around the Sun — the prob- 
ability is that the satellite orbit 
would be near the ecliptic. This 
narrows the search down to a 
specific band or zone. 

Furthermore, as we have seen, 
such satellites must be fairly near, 
probably less than 10,000 miles 
at the most. This determines, in 
approximation, the speed of their 
movement. 

Now if a telescopic camera, 
aiming in the direction of the 
ecliptic, were clockwork guided 
to run opposite to the usual di- 
rection, the plates would be full 
of star tracks. They could easily 
be identified as such because the 
star tracks would all be of the 
same length. 

But if one of these tracks ap- 
peared much shorter than the 
others, it would indicate an ob- 
ject rising in the west. The speed 
of its apparent movement could 
easily be calculated from the 
length of its track, compared with 
the length of a star track. And 
once such an object has been 
“caught,” it will not be lost again. 

Since the unknown moons of 
Earth are likely to be quite small,

ANY QUESTIONS? 

In your book, The Conquest of 
the Moon, I End a table which 
says that the Moon can be, at 
times, more than 30,000 miles 
farther away from the Earth than 
at other times. If this is correct, 
shouldn't the Moon look larger 
sometimes?

Yes, it should and it does. 
Here’s a comparison of the ap- 
parent sizes at the two extreme 
distances. 



- But since the apparent di- 
ameter of the Moon is only 
ahout 1/2 of a degree of arc, 
this difference of not quite 15 
per cent in apparent diameter 
is unlikely to be noticeable to 
the naked eye. 

It does show on photographs, 
however.

This is one of the two ques- 
tions — the other is, “What are 
the Flying Saucers?” — I al- 
ways try to bet on with the 
chairman of a lecture commit- 
tee prior to a public lecture.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



My bet is simply that one or 
both of these questions will be 
asked. But apparently I sound 
so confident when making the 
proposition that no chairman 
has ever accepted the bet. 

Well, to come to the point, 
there is no such thing as a 
distance at which a gravitational 
field will suddenly stop. 

For every star, planet or 
moon, the rule is the same: If 
the gravitational field at the 
surface of the body has a 
strength of 100, the strength 
will be 25 at a distance of one 
radius from the surface. At a 
distance of two radii, it will be 
11. At three radii, 6.3. At four 
radii, 5. At five radii, 2.5. At 
six radii, 2 and at seven radii 
1.6 or still a little more than 
1-1/2 per cent of the surface 
value. And in the case of Earth, 
seven radii amount to more 
than 27,650 miles. 

In other words, a gravita- 
tional field does not stop some- 
where. It slowly peters out, just 



as a powerful light, if you move 
away from it, grows fainter and 
fainter without suddenly dis- 
appearing (except that, on 
Earth, it may be cut off by the 
horizon). 

Therefore, a gravitational 
field “disappears” only if you 
are an “infinite” distance away. 
In practice, however, there 
comes a point where another 
gravitational field is equally 
powerful and, beyond that 
point, more powerful than that 
of Earth. 

For example, at a distance of 
162,000 miles from the sur- 
face of Earth, the field of Earth 
and that of the Sun are of equal 
strength. More than 162,000 
miles from Earth, the gravita- 
tional field of the Sun is 
stronger than that of our planet. 

One might say, then, that 
Earth’s field forms a “bubble” 
some 325,000 miles in diam- 
eter inside the immense gravi- 
tational field of the Sun.

Who or what the Trader was and where he 
came from, nobody knew — or cared— until 
one of his gadgets began to play dirty! 



By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 



I F you’re human, you can’t 
keep a thing around the 
house. You’re always losing 
things and never finding them 
and you go charging through the 
place, yelling, cross-examining, 
blaming. 

That’s the way it is in all fami- 
lies. 

Just one warning — don’t try to 
figure out where all those things 
have gone or who might have 
taken them. If you have any no- 
tion of investigating, forget it. 
You’ll be happier! 

I’ll tell you how it was with me. 
I’d bought the sheet of stamps 
on my way home from the office 



Illustrated by 
BECK

so I could mail out the checks 
for the monthly bills. But I’d just 
sat down to write the checks 
when Marge and Lewis Shaw 
dropped over. I don’t care much 
for Lewis and he barely tolerates 
me. But Marge and Helen are 
good friends, and they got to 
talking, and the Shaws stayed all 
evening. 

Lewis told me about the work 
he was doing at his research lab- 
oratory out at the edge of town. 

I tried to switch him off to some- 
thing else, but he kept right on. 

I suppose he’s so interested in his 
work that he figures everyone else 
must be. But I don’t know a 
thing about electronics and I 
can’t tell a microgauge from a 
microscope. 

It was a fairly dismal evening 
and the worst of it was that I 
couldn’t say so. Helen would 
have jumped all over me for be- 
ing anti-social. 

So, the next evening after din- 
ner, I went into the den to write 
the checks and, of course, the 
stamps were gone. 

1 HAD left the sheet on top of 
the desk and now the desk 
was bare except for one of the 
Bildo-Blocks that young Bill had 
outgrown several years before, 
but which still turn up every now 
and then in the most unlikely 
places. 

I looked around the room. Just 



in case they might have blown 
off the desk, I got down on my 
hands and knees and searched 
under everything. There was no 
sign of the stamps. 

I went into the living room, 
where Helen was curled up in a 
chair, watching television. 

“I haven’t seen them, Joe,” she 
said. “They must be where you 
left them.” 

It was exactly the kind of an- 
swer I should have expected. 

“Bill might know,” I said. 

“He’s scarcely been in the 
house all day. When he does 
show up, you’ve got to speak to 
him.” 

“What’s the matter now?” 

“It’s this trading business. He 
traded off that new belt we got 
him for a pair of spurs.” 

“I can’t see anything wrong in 
that. When I was a kid . .” 

“It’s not just the belt,” she 
said. “He’s traded everything. 
And the worst of it is that he al- 
ways seems to get the best of it.” 
“The kid’s smart.” 

“If you take that attitude, 
Joe . .” 

“It’s not my attitude,” I said. 
“It’s the attitude of the whole 
business world. When Bill grows 
up ...” 

“When he grows up, he’ll be in 
prison. Why, the way he trades, 
you’d swear he was training to be 
a con man!” 

“All right, I’ll talk to him.” 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I went back into the den be- 
cause the atmosphere wasn’t ex- 
actly as friendly as it might have 
been and, anyhow, I had to send 
out those checks, stamps or no 
stamps. 

I got the pile of bills and the 
checkbook and the fountain pen 
out of the drawer. I reached out 
and picked up the Bildo-Block 
to put it to one side, so I’d have 
a good, clear space to work on. 
But the moment I picked it up, 
I knew that this thing was no 
Bildo-Block. 

It was the right size and 
weight and was black and felt 
like plastic, except that it was 
slicker than any plastic I had 
ever felt. It felt as if it had oil on 
it, only it didn’t. 

I set it down in front of me and 
pulled the desk lamp closer. But 
there wasn’t much to see. It still 
looked like one of the Bildo- 
Blocks. 

T URNING it around, I tried to 
make out what it was. On the 
second turn, I saw the faint ob- 
long depression along one side of 
it — a very shallow depression, al- 
most like a scratch. 

I looked at it a little closer and 
could see that the depression was 
machined and that within it was 
a faint red line. I could have 
sworn the red line flickered just a 
little. I held it there, studying it, 
and could detect no further flick- 



er. Either the red had faded or I 
had been seeing things to start 
with, for after a few seconds I 
couldn’t be sure there was any 
line at all. 

I figured it must have been 
something Bill had picked up or 
traded for. The kid is more than 
half pack-rat, but there’s nothing 
wrong with that, nor with the 
trading, either, for all that Helen 
says. It’s just the first signs of 
good business sense. 

I put the block over to one side 
of the desk and went on with the 
checks. The next day, during 
lunch hour, I bought some more 
stamps so I could mail them. 
And off and on, all day, I won- 
dered what could have happened 
to that sheet of stamps. 

I didn’t think at all about the 
block that had the oily feel. Pos- 
sibly I would have forgotten it 
entirely, except that when I got 
home, the fountain pen was miss- 
ing. 

I went into the den to get the 
pen and there the pen was, lying 
on top of the desk where I’d left 
it the night before. Not that I 
remembered leaving it there. But 
when I saw it there, I remem- 
bered having forgotten to put it 
back into the drawer. 

I picked it up. It wasn’t any 
pen. It felt like a cylinder of cork, 
but much too heavy to be any 
kind of cork. Except that it was 
heavier and smaller, it felt some- 



DUSTY ZEBRA

thing — somehow — like a fly rod. 

Thinking of how a fly rod felt, 
I gave my hand a twitch, the way 
you do to cast a line, and sud- 
denly it seemed to be, in fact, a 
fly rod. It apparently had been 
telescoped and now it came un- 
telescoped and lengthened out 
into what might have been a rod. 
But the funny thing about it was 
that it went out only about four 
feet and then disappeared into 
thin air. 

Instinctively, I brought it up 
and back to free the tip from 
wherever it might be. I felt the 
slack take up against a sudden 
weight and I knew I had some- 
thing on the other end of it. Just 
like a fish feels, only it wasn’t 
fighting. 

Then, as quickly as it hap- 
pened, it unhappened. I felt the 
tension snap off and the weight 
at the other end was gone and 
the rod had telescoped again and 
I held in my hand the thing that 
looked like a fountain pen. 

1 LAID it down carefully on the 
desk, being very certain to 
make no more casting motions, 
and it wasn’t until then that I 
saw my hand was shaking. 

I sat down, goggling at the 
thing that looked like the miss- 
ing fountain pen and the other 
thing that looked like a Bildo- 
Block. 

And it was then, while I was 



looking at the two of them, that 
I saw, out of the corner of my 
eye, the little white dot in the 
center of the desk. 

It was on the exact spot where 
the bogus pen had lain and more 
than likely, I imagined, the exact 
spot where I’d found the Bildo- 
Block the night before. It was 
about a quarter of an inch in di- 
ameter and it looked like ivory. 

I put out my thumb and rub- 
bed it vigorously, but the dot 
would not rub off. I closed my 
eyes so the dot would have a 
chance to go away, and then 
opened them again, real quick, to 
surprise it if it hadn’t. It still 
was there. 

I bent over the desk to examine 
it. I could see it was inlaid in the 
wood, and an excellent job of in- 
laying, too. I couldn’t find even 
the faintest line of division be- 
tween the wood and the dot. 

It hadn’t been there before; I 
was sure of that. If it had been, 
I would have noticed it. What’s 
more, Helen would have noticed 
it, for she’s hell on dirt and for- 
ever after things with a dusting 
cloth. And to cinch the fact that 
it had not been there before, no 
one I ever heard of sold desks 
with single inlaid ivory dots. 

And no one sold a thing that 
looked like a fountain pen but 
could become a fly rod, the busi- 
ness end of which disappeared 
and hooked a thing you couldn’t 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



even see — and which, the next 
time, might bring in whatever it 
had caught instead of losing it. 

Helen called to me from the 
living room. “Joe.” 

“Yeah. What is it?” 

“Did you talk to Bill?” 

“Bill? About what?” 

“About the trading.” 

“No. I guess I forgot.” 

“Well, you’ll have to. He’s at it 
again. He traded Jimmy out of 
that new bicycle. Gave him a lot 
of junk. I made him give back 
the bicycle.” 

“I’ll have a talk with him,” I 
promised again. 

B UT I’m afraid I wasn’t pay- 
ing as close attention to the 
ethics of the situation as I should 
have been. 

You couldn’t keep a thing 
around the house. You were al- 
ways losing this or that. You 
knew just where you’d put it and 
you were sure it was there and 
then, when you went to look for 
it, it had disappeared. 

It was happening everywhere 
— things being lost and never 
turning up. 

But other things weren’t left in 
their places — at least not that 
you heard about. 

Although maybe there had 
been times when things had been 
left that a man might pick up and 
examine and not know what they 
were and puzzle over, then toss in 



a corner somewhere and forget. 

Maybe, I thought, the junk- 
yards of the world were loaded 
with outlandish blocks and crazy 
fishing rods. 

I got up and went into the liv- 
ing room, where Helen had 
turned on the television set. 

She must have seen that some- 
thing had me upset, because she 
asked, “What’s the matter now?” 

“I can’t find the fountain pen.” 

She laughed at me. “Honestly, 
Joe, you’re the limit. You’re al- 
ways losing things.” 

That night, I lay awake after 
Helen went to sleep and all I 
could think about was the dot 
upon the desk. A dot, perhaps, 
that said: Put it right here, 

pardner, and we will make a 
swap. ‘ 

And, thinking of it, I wondered 
what would happen if someone 
moved the desk. 

I lay there for a long time, try- 
ing not to worry, trying to tell 
myself it didn’t matter, that I 
was insane to think what I was 
thinking. 

But I couldn’t get it out of my 
mind. 

So I finally got up and sneaked 
out of the bedroom and, feeling 
like a thief in my own house, 
headed for the den. 

I closed the door, turned on 
the desk lamp and took a quick 
look to see if the dot was still 
there. 



DUSTY ZEBRA 



77 



It was. 

I opened the desk drawer and 
hunted for a pencil and couldn’t 
find one, but I finally found one 
of Bill’s crayons. I got down on 
my knees and carefully marked 
the floor around the desk legs, so 
that, if the desk were moved, I 
could put it back again. 

Then, pretending I had no par- 
ticular purpose for doing it, I laid 
the crayon precisely on the dot. 

I N the morning, I sneaked a 
look into the den and the 
crayon was still there. I went to 
work a little easier in my mind, 
for by then I’d managed to con- 
vince myself that jt was all imag- 
ination. 

But that-evening, after dinner, 
I went back into the den and the 
crayon was gone. 

In its place was a triangular 
contraption with what appeared 
to be lenses set in each angle, and 
with a framework of some sort of 
metal, holding in place what ap- 
parently was a suction cup in the 
center of the triangle. 

While I was looking at it, 
Helen came to the door. “Marge 
and I are going to see a movie,” 
she said. “Why don’t you go over 
and have a beer with Lewis?” 
“With that stuffed shirt?” 
“What’s the matter with Lew- 
is?” 

“Nothing, I guess.” I didn’t 
feel up to a family row right then. 



\ 



“What’s that you’ve got?” she 
asked. 

“I don’t know. Just something 
I found.” 

“Well, don’t you start bringing 
home all sorts of junk, the way 
Bill does. One of you is enough 
to clutter up the house.” 

I sat there, looking at the tri- 
angle, and the only thing I could 
figure out was that it might be a 
pair of glasses. The suction cup 
in the center might hold it on the 
wearer’s face and, while that 
might seem a funny way to wear 
a pair of glasses, it made sense 
when you thought about it. But 
if that were true, it meant that 
the wearer had three eyes, set in 
a triangle in his face. 

I sat around for quite a while 
after Helen left, doing a lot of 
thinking. And what I was think- 
ing was that even if I didn’t care 
too much about Lewis, he was 
the only man I knew who might 
be able to help me out. 

So I put the bogus fountain 
pen and the three-eyed glasses in 
the drawer and put the counter- 
feit Bildo-Block in my pocket 
and went across the street. 

Lewis had a bunch of blue- 
prints spread out on the kitchen 
table, and he started to explain 
them to me. I did the best I could 
to act as if I understood them. 
Actually, I didn’t know head nor 
tail of it. 

Finally, I was able to get a 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



word in edgewise and I pulled the 
block out of my pocket and put 
it on the table. 

“What is that?” I asked. 

I expected him to say right off 
it was just a child’s block. But he 
didn’t. There must have been 
something about it to tip him off 
that it wasn’t just a simple block. 
That comes, of course, of having 
a technical education. 

L EWIS picked the block up and 
turned it around in his fin- 
gers. “What’s it made of?” he 
asked me, sounding excited. 

I shook my head. “I don’t 
know what it is or what it’s made 
of or anything about it. I just 
found it.” 

“This is something I’ve never 
seen before.” Then he spotted the 
depression in one side of it and I 
could see I had him hooked. “Let 
me take it down to the shop. 
We’ll see what we can learn.” 

I knew what he was after, of 
course. If the block was some- 
thing new, he wanted a chance to 
go over it — but that didn’t bother 
me any. I had a hunch he 
wouldn’t find out too much about 
it. 

We had a couple more beers 
and I went home. I hunted up an 
old pair of spectacles and put 
them on the desk right over the 
dot. 

I was listening to the news 
when Helen came in. She said she 



was glad I’d spent the evening 
with Lewis, that I should try to 
get to know him better and that, 
once I got to know him better, I 
might like him. She said, since 
she and Marge were such good 
friends, it was a shame Lewis and 
I didn’t hit it off. 

“Maybe we will,” I said and 
let it go at that. 

The next afternoon, Lewis 
called me at the office. 

“Where’d you get that thing?” 
he asked. 

“Found it,” I said. 

“Have any idea what it is?” 
“Nope,” I told him cheerfully. 
“That’s why I gave it to you.” 
“It’s powered in some way and 
it’s meant to measure something. 
That depression in the side must 
be a gauge. Color seems to be 
used as an indicator. At any rate, 
the color line in the depression 
keeps changing all the time. Not 
much, but enough so you can say 
there’s some change.” 

“Next thing is to find out what 
it’s measuring.” 

“Joe, do you know where you 
can get another of them?” 

“No, I don’t.” 

“It’s this way,” he said. “We’d 
like to get into this one, to see 
what makes it tick, but we can’t 
find any way to open it. We could 
break into it, probably, but we’re 
afraid to do that. We might dam- 
age it. Or it might explode. If we 
had another .

“Sorry, Lewis. I don’t know 
where to get another.” 

He had to let it go at that. 

T WENT home that evening 
grinning to myself, thinking 
about Lewis. The guy was fit to 
be tied. He wouldn’t sleep until 
he found out what the thing was, 
now that he’d started on it. It 
probably would keep him out of 
my hair for a week or so. 

I went into the den. The glasses 
still were on the desk. I stood 
there for a moment, looking at 
them, wondering what was 
wrong. Then I saw that the lenses 
had a pinkish shade. 

I picked them up, noticing that 
they had been replaced by the 
kind in the triangular pair I had 
found there the night before. 

Just then, Helen came into the 
room and I could tell, even be- 
fore she spoke, that she had been 
waiting for me. 

“Joe Adams,” she demanded, 
“what have you been up to?” 

“Not a thing,” I told her. 

“Marge says you got Lewis all 
upset.” 

“It doesn’t take a lot to upset 
him.” 

“There’s something going on,” 
she insisted, “and I want to know 
what it is.” 

I knew I was licked. “I’ve been 
trading.” 

“Trading! After all I’ve said 
about Bill!” 



“But this is different.” 

“Trading is trading,” she said 
flatly. 

Bill came in the front door, but 
he must have heard his mother 
say “trading,” for he ducked out 
again. I yelled for him to come 
back. 

“I want both of you to sit down 
and listen to me,” I said. “You 
can ask questions and offer sug- 
gestions and give me hell after 
I’m through.” 

So we sat down, all three of us, 
and had a family powwow. 

It took quite a bit to make 
Helen believe what I had to tell, 
but I pointed out the dot in the 
desk and showed them the trian- 
gular glasses and the pair of 
glasses that had been refitted 
with the pink lenses and sent 
back to me. By that time, she 
was ready to admit there was 
something going on. Even so, she 
was fairly well burned up at me 
for marking up the floor around 
the desk legs. 

I didn’t show either her or Bill 
the pen that was a fishing rod, 
for I was scared of that. Flourish 
it around a bit and there was no 
telling what would happen. 

Bill was interested and excited, 
of course. This was trading, 
which was right down his alley. 

I cautioned both of them not 
to say a word about it. Bill 
wouldn’t, for he was hell on se- 
crets and special codes. But

bright and early in the morning, 
Helen would probably swear 
Marge to secrecy, then tell her 
all about it and there wasn’t a 
thing that I could do or say to 
stop her. 

Bill wanted to put the pink- 
lensed spectacles on right away, 
to see how they were different 
from any other kind. I wouldn’t 
let him. I wanted to put those 
specs on myself, but I was afraid 
to, if you want to know the truth. 

W HEN Helen went out to the 
kitchen to get dinner, Bill 
and I held a strategy session. For 
a ten-year-old. Bill had a lot of 
good ideas. We agreed that we 
ought to get some system into the 
trading, because, as Bill pointed 
out, the idea of swapping sight 
unseen was a risky sort of busi- 
ness. A fellow ought to have some 
say in what he was getting in re- 
turn. 

But to arrive at an understand- 
ing with whoever we were trad- 
ing with meant that we’d have to 
set up some sort of communica- 
tion system. And how do you 
communicate with someone you 
don’t know the first thing about, 
except that perhaps it has three 
eyes? 

Then Bill hit upon what 
seemed a right idea. What we 
needed, he said, was a catalogue. 
If you were going to trade with 
someone, the logical first step 



would be to let them know what 
you had to trade. 

To be worth anything in such 
a circumstance, it would have to 
be an illustrated catalogue. And 
even then it might be worthless, 
for how could we be sure that 
the Trader on the other side of 
the desk would know what a pic- 
ture was? Maybe he’d never seen 
a picture before. Maybe he saw 
differently — not so much physi- 
cally, although that was possible, 
too, but from a different view- 
point and with totally alien con- 
cepts. 

But it was the only thing we 
had to go on, so we settled down 
to work up a catalogue. Bill 
thought we should draw one, but 
neither of us was any good at 
drawing. I suggested illustrations 
from magazines. But that wasn t 
too hot an idea, either, for pic- 
tures of items in the magazine 
ads are usually all prettied up, 
designed to catch the eye. 

Then Bill had a top-notch idea. 
“You know that kid dictionary 
Aunt Ethel gave me? Why don’t 
we send that to them? It’s got a 
lot of pictures and not much 
reading in it, and that s impor- 
tant. The reading might confuse 
them.” 

So we went into his room and 
started looking through all the 
junk he had, searching for the 
dictionary. But we ran across one 
of the old ABC books he’d had 



dusty zebra 



81 




when he was just a toddler and 
decided it was even better than 
the dictionary. It had good clear 
pictures and almost no reading 
at all. You know the kind of book 
I mean — A for apple, B for ball 
and so forth. 

We took the book into the den 
and put it on the desk, centering 
it on the dot, then went out to 
dinner. 

TN the morning, the book had 
disappeared and that was a 
little odd. Up until then, nothing 
had disappeared from the desk 
until later in the day. 

Early that afternoon, Lewis 
called me up. “I’m coming down 
to see you, Joe. Is there a bar 
handy where the two of us can 
be alone?” 

I told him there was one only 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a block from me and said I’d 
meet him there. 

I got a few things cleared away, 
then left the office, figuring I’d go 
over to the bar and have a quick 
one before Lewis showed up. 

I don’t know how he did it, but 
he was there ahead of me, back 
jn a comer booth. He must have 
broken every traffic regulation 
on the books. 

He had a couple of drinks 
waiting for us and was all hud- 
dled over, like a conspirator. He 
was a bit out of breath, as he 
had every right to be. 

“Marge told me,” he said. 

“I suspected she would.” 

“There could be a mint in it, 
Joe!” 

“That’s what I thought, too. 
That’s why I’m willing to give 
you ten per cent . .” 

“Now look here,” squawked 
Lewis. “You can’t pull a deal 
like that. I wouldn’t touch it for 
less than fifty.” 

“I’m letting you in on it,” I 
said, “because you’re a neighbor. 
I don’t know beans about this 
technical business. I’m getting 
stuff I don’t understand and I 
need some help to find out what 
it is, but I can always go to some- 
one else . 

It took us three drinks to get 
the details settled — thirty-five 
per cent for him, sixty-five for 
me. 

“Now that that’s settled,” I 



said, “suppose you tell me what 
you found.” 

“Found?” 

“That block I gave you. You 
wouldn’t have torn down here 
and had the drinks all set up and 
waiting if you hadn’t found 
something.” 

“Well, as a matter of fact . .” 
“Now just a minute,” I warned 
him. “We’re going to put this in 
the contract — any failure to pro- 
vide full and complete analy- 
sis . .” 

“What contract?” 

“We’re going to have a con- 
tract drawn up, so either of us 
can sue the other within an inch 
of his life for breaking it.” 

Which is a hell of a way to 
start out a business venture, but 
it’s the only way to handle a 
slippery little skate like Lewis. 

S O he told me what he’d found. 

“It’s an emotions gauge. That’s 
awkward terminology, I know, 
but it’s the best I can think of.” 
“What does it do?” 

“It tells how happy you are or 
how sad or how much you hate 
someone.” 

“Oh, great,” I said, disappoint- 
ed. “What good is a thing like 
that? I don’t need a gauge to tell 
me if I’m sore or glad or any- 
thing.” 

He waxed practically eloquent. 
“Don’t you see what an instru- 
ment like that would mean to 



DUSTY ZEBRA 



83 



psychiatrists? It would tell more 
about patients than they’d ever 
be willing to tell about them- 
selves. It could be used in mental 
institutions and it might be im- 
portant in gauging reactions for 
the entertainment business, poli- 
tics, law-enforcement and Lord 
knows what else.” 

“No kidding! Then let’s start 
marketing!” 

“The only thing is . .” 

“Yes?” 

“We can’t manufacture them,” 
he said frustratedly. “We haven’t 
got the materials and we don’t 
know how they’re made. You’ll 
have to trade for them.” 

“I can’t. Not right away, that 
is. First I’ve got to be able to 
make the Traders understand 
what I want, and then I’ll have 
to find out what they’re willing 
to trade them for.” 

“You have some other stuff?” 
“A few things.” 

“You better turn them over to 
me.” 

“Some that could be danger- 
ous. Anyhow, it all belongs to me. 
I’ll give you what I want, when 
I wanf and . .” 

We were off again. 

We finally wound up by ad- 
journing to an attorney’s office. 
We wrote up a contract that is 
probably one of the legal curi- 
osities of all time. 

I’m convinced the attorney 
thought, and still thinks, both of 



us are crazy, but that’s the least 
of my worries now. 

The contract said I was to turn 
over to Lewis, for his determina- 
tion of its technical and mer- 
chandisable nature, at least 90 
per cent of certain items, the 
source of which I alone cqn- 
trolled, and with the further un- 
derstanding that said source was 
to remain at all times under my 
exclusive control. The other 10 
per cent might, without preju- 
dice, be withheld from his exami- 
nation, with the party of the first 
part having sole authority to 
make determination of which 
items should constitute the with- 
held 10 per cent. 

T TPON the 90 per cent of the 
^ items supplied him, the par- 
ty of the second part was to make 
a detailed analysis, in writing, 
accompanied by such explana- 
tory material as was necessary to 
the complete understanding of 
the party of the first part, within 
no more than three months after 
receipt, at the end of which time 
the items reverted solely to the 
ownership of the party of the first 
part. Except that such period of 
examination and determination 
might be extended, under a mu- 
tual agreement made in writing, 
for any stated time. 

Under no circumstances should 
the party of the second part con- 
ceal from the party of the first 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



part any findings he might have 
made upon any of the items cov- 
ered by the agreement, and that 
such concealment, should it oc- 
cur, should be considered suffi- 
cient cause for action for the 
recovery of damages. That under 
certain conditions where some of 
the items might be found to be 
manufacturable, they could be 
manufactured under the terms of 
clauses A, B and C, section XII 
of this agreement. 

Provisions for a sales organiza- 
tion to market any of said items 
shall be set up and made a part 
of this agreement. That any pro- 
ceeds from such sales shall be di- 
vided as follows: 65 per cent to 
the party of the first part (me, 
in case you’ve gotten lost, which 
is understandable), and 35 per 
cent to the party of the second 
part (Lewis); costs to be appor- 
tioned accordingly. 

There were a lot more details, 
of course, but that gives you an 
idea. 

We got home from the attor- 
ney’s office, without either of us 
knifing the other, and found 
Marge over at my place. Lewis 
went in with me to have a look 
at the desk. 

Apparently the Trader had re- 
ceived the ABC book all right 
and had been able to understand 
why it was sent, for there, lying 
on the desk, was a picture cut out 
of the book. Well, not cut out, 



exactly — it looked more as 
though it had been burned out. 

The picture on the desk was Z 
for zebra. 

Lewis stared worriedly at it. 
“Now we’re really in a fix.” 

“Yeah,” I admitted. “I don’t 
know what the market price is, 
but they can’t be cheap.” 

“Figure it out — expedition, sa- 
fari, cages, ship, rail, fodder, 
keeper. You think we can switch 
him to something else?” 

“I don’t see how. He’s put in 
his order.” 

Bill came wandering in and 
wanted to know what was up. 
When I glumly told him, he said 
cheerfully, “Aw, that’s the whole 
trick in trading, Pop. If you got 
a bum jackknife you want to 
trade, you unload it on somebody 
who doesn’t know what a good 
knife is like.” 

Lewis didn’t get it, but I did. 
“That’s right! He doesn’t know a 
zebra is an animal, or, if he does, 
how big it is!” 

“Sure,” Bill said confidently. 
“All he saw was a picture.” 

I T was five o’clock then, but the 
three of us went uptown and 
shopped. Bill found a cheap 
bracelet charm about the size of 
the drawing in the book. When it 
, comfes to junk like that, my kid 
knows just where it’s sold and 
how much it costs. I considered 
making him a junior partner in 



DUSTY ZEBRA

charges of such emergencies, with 
about 10 per cent share or so — 
out of Lewis’s 35 per cent, of 
course — but I was sure Lewis 
wouldn’t hold still for that. I de- 
cided instead to give Bill a dollar 
a week allowance, said compen- 
sation to commence immediately 
upon our showing a profit. 

Well, we had Z for zebra — pro- 
vided the Trader was satisfied 
with a little piece of costume 
jewelry. It was lucky, I thought, 
that it hadn’t been Z for zephyr. 

The rest of the alphabet was 
easy, yet I couldn’t help but kick 
myself over all the time we were 
wasting. Of all the unworthy cat- 
alogues we might have sent, that 
ABC book was the worst. But 
until the Trader had run through 
the whole list, I was afraid to 
send another for fear of confus- 
ing him. 

So I sent him an apple and a 
ball and a small doll for girl and 
a toy cat and toy dog, and so on, 
and then I lay awake nights won- 
dering what the Trader would 
make of them. I could picture 
him trying to learn the use of a 
rubber doll or cat. 

I’d given Lewis the two pairs of 
glasses, but had held back the 
fountain-pen fishing rod, for I was 
still scared of that one. He had 
turned over the emotion gauge 
to a psychiatrist to try out in his 
practice as a sort of field test. 

Marge and Helen, knowing 



that Lewis and I had entered into 
some kind of partnership, were 
practically inseparable now. Hel- 
en kept telling me how glad she 
was that I had finally recognized 
what a sterling fellow Lewis was. 
I suppose Lewis heard the same 
thing about me from Marge. 

Bill went around practically 
busting to do some bragging. But 
Bill is a great little businessman 
and he kept his mouth shut. I 
had told him about the allow- 
ance, of course. 

T EWIS was all for trying to ask 
the Trader for a few more of 
the emotion gauges. He had a 
draftsman at the plant draw up a 
picture of the gauge and he want- 
ed me to send it through to indi- 
cate that we were interested in it. 

But I told him not to try to 
rush things. While the emotion 
gauge might be a good deal, we 
should sample what the Trader 
had to offer before we made up 
our minds. 

The Trader, apparently certain 
now that someone was cooperat- 
ing with him, had dropped his 
once-a-day trade schedule and 
was open for business around the 
clock. After he had run through 
the list in the ABC book, he sent 
back a couple of blank pages 
from the book with very crude 
drawings on them — drawings that 
looked as if they had been made 
with crumbly charcoal. Lewis 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



N jrew a series of pictures, showing 
[jow a pencil worked, and we sent 
the Trader a ream of paper and 
3 gross of sharpened pencils, then 
sat back to wait. 

We waited a week and were 
getting sort of edgy, when back 
came the entire ream of paper, 
with each sheet covered on both 
sides with all kinds of drawings. 
So we sent him a mail-order cat- 
alogue, figuring that would hold 
him for a while, and settled down 
to try to puzzle out the drawings 
he had made. 

There wasn’t a single thing 
that made any sense at all — not 
even to Lewis. He’d study some 
of the drawings, then pace up and 
down the room, pulling his hair 
and twitching his ears. Then he’d 
study the drawings some more. 

To me, it all looked plain Rube 
Goldbergish. 

Finally, we figured we might 
as well forget about the catalogue 
idea, for the time being at least, 
and we started feeding all sorts 
of stuff through the desk — scis- 
sors, dishes, shoes, jackknives, 
mucilage, cigars, paper clips, 
erasers, spoons — almost anything 
that was handy. It wasn’t the 
scientific way, I know, but we 
didn’t have the time to get very 
methodical about it and, until we 
had a chance to work out a more 
sensible program, we figured we 
might as well try the shotgun 
method.

And the Trader started shoot- 
ing things back at us. We’d sit 
for hours and feed stuff through 
to him and then he’d shoot stuff 
back at us and we had the damn- 
edest pile of junk heaped all over 
the place you ever laid eyes on. 

W E rigged up a movie camera 
and took a lot of film of the 
spot on the desk where the ex- 
change was going on. We spent 
a lot of time viewing that film, 
slowing it down and even stop- 
ping it, but it didn’t tell us any- 
thing at all. When the stuff 
disappeared or appeared, it just 
disappeared or appeared. One 
frame it would be there, the next 
frame it would be gone. 

Lewis canceled all his other 
work and used the lab for noth- 
ing but trying to puzzle out the 
gadgets that we got. Most of 
them we couldn’t crack at all. I 
imagine they were useful in some 
way, but we never managed to 
learn how. 

There was the perfume bottle, 
for example. That is what we 
called it, anyhow. But there was 
a suspicion in our minds that the 
perfume was simply a secondary 
effect, that the so-called bottle 
was designed for some other pur- 
pose entirely. 

Lewis and his boys were study- 
ing it down at the lab, trying to 
make out some rhyme or reason 
for it, and somehow they turned 



86 



87 



it on. They worked for three 
days, the last two in gas masks, 
trying to turn it off again. When 
the smell got so bad that people 
began calling the police, we took 
the contraption out into the 
country and buried it. Within a 
few days, all the vegetation in the 
area was dead. All the rest of the 
summer, the boys from the agri- 
cultural department at the uni- 
versity ran around, practically 
frothing at the mouth, trying to 
find the cause. 

There was the thing that might 
have been a clock of some sort, 
although it might just as easily 
have been something else. If it 
was a clock, the Trader had a 
time system that would drive you 
nuts, for it would measure the 
minutes or hours or whatever 
they were like lightning for a 
while, then barely move for an 
entire day. 

And there was the one you’d 
point at something and press a 
certain spot on it — not a button 
or a knob or anything as crass 
and mechanical as that, just a 
certain spot — and there’d be just 
a big blank spot in the landscape. 
But when you stopped pressing, 
the landscape would come back * 
again, unchanged. We filed it 
away in the darkest comer of the 
laboratory safe, with a big red 
tag on it marked : Dangerous! 
Don’t Monkey with This! 

But most of the items we just 



drew blanks on. And it kept com- 
ing all the time. I piled the 
garage full of it and started 
dumping it in the basement. 
Some of it I was scared of and 
hauled out to the dump. 

TN the meantime, Lewis was 
-*■ having trouble with the emo- 
tion gauge. “It works,” he said. 
“The psychiatrist I gave it to to 
try out is enthusiastic about it. 
But it seems almost impossible 
to get it on the market.” 

“If it works,” I objected, hand- 
ing him a can of beer, “it ought 
to sell.” , 

“In any other field, it might, 
but you don’t handle merchan- 
dise that way in the medical 
field. Before you can put some- 
thing on the market, you have to 
have it nailed down with blue- 
prints and theory and field tests 
and such. And we can’t. We don’t 
know how it works. We don’t 
know why it works. Until we do, 
no reputable medical supply 
house will take it on, no approved 
medical journal will advertise it, 
no practitioner will use it.” 

“Then I guess it’s out.” I felt 
fairly blue about it, because it 
was the only thing we had that 
we knew how to use. 

Lewis nodded and drank his 
beer and was glummer than ever. 

Looking back on it, it’s funny 
how we found the gadget that 
made us all the money-. Actually,

it wasn’t Lewis but Helen who 
found it. 

Helen is a good housewife. 
She’s always going after things 
with the vacuum and the dust- 
cloth and she washes the wood- 
work so often and so furiously 
that we have to paint it every 
year. 

One night, we were sitting in 
the living room, watching tele- 
vision. 

“Joe,” she asked me, “did you 
dust the den?” 

“Dust the den? What would I 
want to do that for?” 

“Well, someone did. Maybe it 
was Bill.” 

“Bill wouldn’t be caught dead 
with a dustcloth in his mitt.” 

“I can’t understand it, Joe,” 
she said. “I went in there to dust 
it and it was absolutely clean. 
Everything just shone.” 

Sgt. Friday was trying to get 
the facts out of someone and his 
sidekick was complaining about 
some relatives that had come to 
visit and I didn’t pay much at- 
tention at the time. 

But the next day, I got to 
thinking about it and I couldn’t 
get it off my mind. I certainly 
hadn’t dusted the den and it was 
a cinch Bill hadn’t, yet someone 
had if Helen was ready to admit 
it was clean. 

So, that evening, I went out 
into the street with a pail and 
shoveled up a pailful of dirt and^ 



brought it in the house. 

Helen caught me as I was com- 
ing in the door. “What do you 
think you’re doing with that?” 
“Experimenting,” I told her. 
“Do it in the garage.” 

“It isn’t possible,” I argued. “I 
have to find out who’s been dust- 
ing the den.” 

I knew that, if my hunch 
failed, I’d have a lot to answer 
for when she followed me and 
stood in the doorway, ready to 
pounce. 

T HERE was a bunch of junk 
from the Trader standing on 
the desk and a lot more of it in 
one comer. I cleared off the desk 
and that was when Bill came in. 

“What you doing, Dad?” he 
asked. 

“Your father’s gone insane,” 
Helen explained quietly. 

They stood there, watching 
me, while I took a handful of dirt 
and sprinkled it on the desk top. 

It stayed there for just an in- 
stant — and then it was gone. The 
top of the desk was spotless. 

“Bill,” I said, “take one of 
those gadgets out to the garage.” 
“Which one?” 

“It doesn’t matter.” 

So he took one and I spread 
another handful of dirt and, in a 
second, it was gone. 

Bill was back by that time and 
I sent him out with another 
gadget. 



DUSTY ZEBRA 



89 



We kept on like that for quite 
a while and Bill was beginning to 
get disgusted with me. But final- 
ly I sprinkled the dirt and it 
stayed. 

“Bill,” I said, “you remember 
the last thing you took out?” 

“Sure.” 

“Well, go out and bring it back 
again.” 

He got it and, as soon as he 
reached the door of the den, the 
dirt disappeared. 

“Well, that’s it,” I said. 

“That’s what?” asked Helen. 

I pointed to the contraption 
Bill had in his hand. “That. 
Throw away your vacuum clean- 
er. Burn up the dustcloth. Heave 
out the mop. Just have one of 
those in the house and . .” 

She threw herself into my 
arms. 

“Oh, Joe!” 

We danced a jig, the two of us. 

Then I sat around for a while, 
kicking myself for tying up with 
Lewis, wondering if maybe there 
wasn’t some way I could break 
the contract now that I had 
found something without any 
help from him. But I remem- 
bered all those clauses we had 
written in. It wouldn’t have been 
any use, anyhow, for Helen was 
already across the street, telling 
Marge about it. 

So I phoned Lewis at the lab 
and he came tearing over. 

We ran field tests. 



The living room was spotless 
from Bill just having walked 
through it, carrying the gadget, 
and the garage, where he had 
taken it momentarily, was spic 
and span. While we didn’t check 
it, I imagine that an area paral- 
leling the path he had taken from 
the front door to the garage was 
the only place outdoors that 
didn’t have a speck of dust upon 
it. 

W E took the gadget down in 
the basement and cleaned 
that up. We sneaked over to a 
neighbor’s back yard, where we 
knew there was a lot of cement 
dust, held the gadget over it and 
in an instant there wasn’t any 
cement dust. ‘There were just a 
few pebbles left and the pebbles, 
I suppose, you couldn’t rightly 
classify as dust. 

We didn’t need to know any 
more. 

Back at the house, I broke 
open a bottle of Scotch I’d been 
saving, while Lewis sat down at 
the kitchen table and drew a 
sketch of the gadget. 

We had a drink, then went into 
the den and put the drawing on 
the desk. The drawing disap- 
peared and we waited. In a few 
minutes, another one of the gadg- 
ets appeared. We waited for a 
while and nothing happened. 

“We’ve got to let him know we 
want a lot of them,” I said.

“There’s no way we can,” said 
Lewis. “We don’t know his 
mathematical symbols, he doesn’t 
know ours, and there’s no sure- 
fire way to teach him. He doesn’t 
know a single word of our lan- 
guage and we don’t know a word 
of his.” 

We went back to the kitchen 
and had another drink. 

Lewis sat down and drew a 
row of the gadgets across a sheet 
of paper, then sketched in repre- 
sentations of others behind them 
so that, when you looked at it, 
you could see that there were 
hundreds of them. 

We sent that through. 

Fourteen gadgets came back — 
the exact number Lewis had 
sketched in the first row. 

Apparently the Trader had no 
idea of perspective. The lines that 
Lewis had drawn to represent the 
other gadgets behind the first row 
didn’t mean a thing to him. 

We went back to the kitchen 
and had a few more drinks. 

“We’ll need thousands of the 
things,” said Lewis, holding his 
head in his hands. “I can’t sit 
here day and night, drawing 
them.” 

“You may have to do that,” I 
said, enjoying myself. 

“There must be another way.” 

“Why not draw a bunch of 
them, then mimeograph the 
drawing?” I suggested. “We could 
send the mimeographed sheets 



through to him in bundles.” 

I hated to say it, because I was 
still enamored of the idea of 
sticking Lewis somewhere off in a 
corner, sentenced to a lifetime of 
drawing the same thing over and 
over. 

“That might work,” said Lew- 
is, brightening annoyingly. “It’s 
just simple enough . .” 

“Practical is the word,” I 
snapped. “If it were simple, you’d 
have thought of it.” 

“I leave things like that to de- 
tail men.” 

“You’d better!” 

It took a while and a whole 
bottle before we calmed down. 

N EXT day, we bought a mime- 
ograph machine and Lewis 
drew a stencil with twenty-five 
of the gadgets on it. We ran 
through a hundred sheets and 
sent them through the desk. 

It worked — we were busy for 
several hours, getting those gadg- 
ets out of the way as they poured 
through to us. 

I’m afraid we never stopped to 
think about what the Trader 
might want in return for the dust- 
collectors. We were so excited 
that we forgot, for the 'moment, 
that this was a commercial prop- 
osition and not just something 
gratis. 

But the next afternoon, back 
came the mimeographed sheets 
we’d sent through and, on the re- 



DUSTY ZEBRA

verse side of each of them, the 
Trader had drawn twenty-five 
representations of the zebra 
bracelet charm. 

And there we were, faced with 
the necessity of getting together, 
pronto, twenty-five hundred of 
those silly zebras. 

I tore down to the store where 
I’d gotten the bracelet, but all 
they had in stock were two dozen 
of the things. They said they 
didn’t think they could order any 
more. The number, they said, 
had been discontinued. 

The name of the company that 
made them was stamped on the 
inside of the bracelet and, as soon 
as I got home, I put in a long 
distance call. 

I finally got hold of the. pro- 
duction manager. “You know 
those bracelets you put out?” 
“We put out millions of ’em. 
Which one are you talking 
about?” 

“The one with the zebra on it.” 
He thought a moment. “Yeah, 
we did. Quite a while ago. We 
don’t make them any more. In 
this business . .” 

“I need at least twenty-five 
hundred of them.” 

“Twenty-five hundred brace- 
lets?” 

“No, just the zebras.” 

“Look, is this a gag?” 

“It’s no gag, mister,” I said. “I 
need those zebras. I’m willing to 
pay for them.” 



“We haven’t any in stock.” 
“Couldn’t you make them?” 
“Not just twenty-five hundred 
of them. Wouldn’t be worth it to 
put through a special order for 
so few. If it was fifty thousand, 
say, we might consider it.” 

“All right, then,” I said. “How 
much for fifty thousand?” 

TTE named a price and we hag- 
■1-*- gled some, but I was in no 
position to do much bargaining. 
We finally agreed on a price I 
knew was way too high, consider- 
ing the fact that the entire brace- 
let, with the zebra and a lot of 
other junk, had only retailed at 
39 cents. 

“And hold the order open,” I 
told him. “We might want more 
of them.” 

“Okay,” he said. “Just one 
thing — would you mind telling 
me what you want with fifty 
thousand zebras?” 

“Yes, I would,” I said and 
hung up. 

I suppose he thought I was off 
my rocker, but who cared what 
he thought? 

It took ten days to get that 
shipment of fifty thousand zebras 
and I sweated out every minute 
of it. Then there was the job of 
getting them under cover when it 
came and, in case you don’t 
know, fifty thousand zebras, even 
when they’re only bracelet 
charms, take up room.

But first I took out twenty-five 
hundred and sent them through 
the desk. 

For the ten days since we’d 
gotten the dust-collectors, we’d 
sent nothing through and there 
had been no sign from the Trad- 
er that he might be getting im- 
patient. I wouldn’t have blamed 
him a bit if he’d done something, 
like sending through his equiva- 
lent of a bomb, to express his dis- 
satisfaction at our slow delivery. 
I’ve often wondered what he 
thought of the long delay — if he 
hadn’t suspected we were reneg- 
ing on the bargain. 

All this time, I had been smok- 
ing too much and gnawing my 
fingernails and I’d figured that 
Lewis was just as busy seeing 
what could be done about mar- 
keting the dusters. 

But when I mentioned it to 
him, he just looked blank. “You 
know, Joe, I’ve been doing a lot 
of worrying.” 

“We haven’t a thing to worry 
about now,” I said, “except get- 
ting these things sold.” 

“But the dust must go some- 
where,” he fretted. 

“The dust?” 

“Sure, the dust these things 
collect. Remember we picked up 
an entire pile of cement dust? 
What I want to know is where it 
all went. The gadget itself isn’t 
big enough to hold it. It isn’t big 
enough to hold even a week’s col- 



lection of dust from the average 
house. That’s what worries me — 
where does it go?” 

“I don’t care where. It goes, 
doesn’t it?” 

“That’s the pragmatic view,” 
he said scornfully. 

It turned out that Lewis hadn’t 
done a thing about marketing, so 
I got busy. 

But I ran into the same trouble 
we’d had trying to sell the emo- 
tion gauge. 

The dust collector wasn’t pat- 
ented and it didn’t have a brand 
name. There was no fancy label 
stuck on it and it didn’t bear a 
manufacturer’s imprint. And 
when anybody asked me how it 
worked, I couldn’t answer. 

One wholesaler did make me a 
ridiculous offer. I laughed in his 
face and walked out. 

T HAT night, Lewis and I sat 
around the kitchen table, 
drinking beer, and neither of us 
too happy. I could see a lot of 
trouble ahead in getting the gadg- 
ets sold. Lewis, it seemed, was 
still worrying about what hap- 
pened to the dust. 

He had taken one of the dust 
collectors apart and the only 
thing he could find out about it 
was that there was some feeble 
force-field operating inside of it 
— feeble yet strong enough to 
play hell with the electrical cir- 
cuits and fancy metering machin- 



DUSTY ZEBRA

ery he has at the lab. As soon as 
he found out what was happen- 
ing, he slapped the cover back on 
as quick as he could and then 
everything was all right. The cov- 
er was a shield against the force- 
field. 

“That dust must be getting 
thrown into another dimension,” 
he told me, looking like a hound 
dog that had lost a coon track. 

“Maybe not. It could be wind- 
ing up in one of those dust clouds 
way out in space.” 

He shook his head. 

“You can’t tell me,” I said, 
“that the Trader is crazy enough 
to sell us a gadget that will throw 
dust back into his face.” 

“You miss the point entirely. 
The Trader is operating from an- 
other dimension. He must be. 
And if there are two dimensions, 
his and ours, there may be oth- 
ers. The Trader must have used 
these dust collectors himself — 
not for the same purpose we in- 
tend, perhaps, but they get rid of 
something that he doesn’t want 
around. So, necessarily, they’d 
have to be rigged to get rid of it 
in a dimension other than his.” 

We sat there drinking beer, and 
I started turning over that busi- 
ness about different dimensions 
in my head. I couldn’t grasp the 
concept. Maybe Lewis was right 
about me being a pragmatist. If 
you can’t see it or touch it or 
even guess what it would be like. 



how can you believe there might 
be another dimension? I couldn’t. 

So I started to talk about mar- 
keting the dust collector and be- 
fore Lewis went home that night, 
we’d decided that the only thing 
left to do was sell it door to door. 
We even agreed to charge $12.50 
for it. The zebras figured out to 
four cents each and we would pay 
our salesmen ten per cent com- 
mission, which would leave us a 
profit of $11.21 apiece. 

I put an ad in the paper for 
salesmen and the next day we 
had several applicants. We start- 
ed them out on a trial run. 

Those gadgets sold like hot- 
cakes and we knew we were in! 

T QUIT my job and settled 
■*- down to handling the sales 
end, while Lewis went back to 
the lab and started going through 
the pile of junk we had gotten 
from the Trader. 

There are a lot of headaches 
running a sales campaign. You 
have to map out territories for 
your salesmen, get clearance from 
Better Business Bureaus, bail out 
your men if they’re thrown in the 
clink for running afoul of some 
obscure village ordinance. There 
are more worrisome angles to it 
than you can ever imagine. 

But in a couple of months’ 
time, things were running pretty 
smoothly. We had the state well 
covered and were branching out 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



into others. I had ordered an- 
other fifty thousand zebras and 
told them to expect re-orders — 
and the desk top was a busy 
place. It got to a point, finally, 
where I had to hire three men 
full time, paying them plenty not 
to talk, to man that desk top 24 
hours a day. We’d send through 
zebras for eight hours, then take 
away dust gadgets for eight 
hours, then feed through zebras 
for another eight. 

If the Trader had any qualms 
about what was happening, he 
gave no sign of it. He seemed 
perfectly happy to send us dust 
collectors so long as we sent him 
zebras. 

The neighbors were curious 
and somewhat upset at first, but 
finally they got used to it. If I 
could have moved to some other 
location, I would have, for the 
house was more an office than a 
home and we had practically no 
family life at all. But if we want- 
ed to stay in business, we had to 
stay right where we were because 
it was the only place we had 
contact with the Trader. 

The money kept rolling in and 
I turned the management of it 
over to Helen and Marge. The 
income tax boys gave us a rough 
time when we didn’t show man- 
ufacturing expenses, but since we 
weren’t inclined to argue over 
what we had to pay, they could- 
n’t do anything about it. 



Lewis was wearing himself 
down to a nubbin at the lab, but 
he wasn’t finding anything that 
we could use. 

But he still did some worrying 
now and then about where all 
that dust was going. And he was 
right, probably for the first time 
in his life. 

O NE afternoon, a couple of 
years after we’d started sell- 
ing the dust collectors, I had been 
uptown to attend to some bank- 
ing difficulties that Helen and 
Marge had gotten all bollixed 
up. I’d no more than pulled into 
the driveway when Helen came 
busting out of the house. She was 
covered with dust, her face streak- 
ed with it, and she was the mad- 
dest-looking woman I have ever 
seen. 

“You’ve got to do something 
about it, Joe!” she shrieked. 
“About what?” 

“The dust! It’s pouring into 
the house!” 

“Where is it pouring from?” 
“From everywhere!” 

I could see she’d opened all the 
windows and there was dust pour- 
ing out of them, almost like a 
smoke cloud. I got out of the car 
and took a quick look up and 
down the street. Every house in 
the block had its windows open 
and there was dust coming out 
of all of them and the neighbor- 
hood was boiling with angry, 



DUSTY ZEBRA 



95 



screaming women. 

“Where’s Bill?” I asked. 

“Out back.” 

I ran around the house and 
called him and he came running. 

Marge had come across the 
street and, if anything, she was 
about six degrees sorer about all 
the dust than Helen was. 

“Get in the car,” I said. 

“Where are we going?” Marge 
demanded. 

“Out to pick up Lewis.” 

I must have sounded like noth- 
ing to trifle with, for they piled 
in and I got out of there as fast 
as the car would take us. 

The homes and factories and 
stores that had bought the 
gadget were gushing so much 
dust, visibility wouldn’t be worth 
a damn before long. 

I had to wade through about 
two feet of dust on the laboratory 
floor to get to Lewis’s office and 
hold a handkerchief over my 
nose to keep from suffocating. 

TNSIDE the car, we got our 

faces wiped off and most of 
the dust hacked out of our 
throats. I could see then that 
Lewis was about three shades 
paler than usual, although, to 
tell tl^e truth, he always was a 
pasty-looking creature. 

“It’s the creatures from that 
third dimension,” he said anxi- 
ously. “The place where we were 
sending all the dust. They got 




96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sick and tired of having it pour 
in on them and they got it figur- 
ed out and now they’re firing the 
dust right back at us.” 

“Now calm down. We’re just 
jumping at the conclusion that 
this was caused by our gadget.” 
“I checked, Joe. It was. The 
dust is coming out in jets from 
' every single place where we sent 
it through. No place else.” 
“Then all we have to do is 
fire it back at them.” 

He shook his head. “Not a 
chance. The gadget works one 
way now — from them to us.” 
He coughed and looked wildly at 
me. “Think of it! A couple of 
million of those gadgets, picking 
up dust from a couple of million 
homes, stores and factories — some 
of them operating for two whole 
years! Joe, what are we going 
to do?” 

“We’re going to hole up some- 
where till this — well, blows over.” 
Being of a nasty legal turn of 
mind, he probably foresaw even 
then the countless lawsuits that 
would avalanche on us. Person- 
ally, I was more scared of being 
mobbed by angry women. 

But that’s all past history. We 
hid out till people had quieted 
down and then began trying to 
settle the suits out of court. We 
had a lot of money and were 
able to pay off most of them. The 
judgments against us still out- 
standing don’t amount to more 
* 

DUSTY ZEBRA 



than a few hundred thousand. 
We could wipe that out pretty 
quickly if we’d just hit on some- 
thing else as profitable as the 
cleaning gadget. 

Lewis is working hard at it, but 
he isn’t having any luck. And the 
Trader is gone now. As soon as 
we dared come home, I went into 
the house and had a look at the 
desk. The inlaid dot was gone. 
I tried putting something where 
it had been, but nothing hap- 
pened. 

What scared the Trader off? 
I’d give a lot to know. Mean- 
while, there are some commercial 
prospects. 

The rose-tinted glasses, for in- 
stance, that we call the Happiness 
Lenses. Put them on and you’re 
happy as a clam. Almost every 
person on the face of the Earth 
would like a pair of them, so 
they could forget their troubles 
for a while. They would probably 
play hob with the liquor busi- 
ness. 

The trouble is that we don’t 
know how to make them and, 
now that the Trader’s gone, we 
can’t swap for them. 

But there’s one thing that 
keeps worrying me. I know I 
shouldn’t let it bother me, but I 
can’t keep it out of mind. 

Just what did the Trader do 
with those couple of million 
zebras we sent him?

A sound awoke O’Keefe in- 
stantly. He threw back his 
covers, slid from the cot, 
grabbed his B-pistol from the 
wall and, with his foot, smashed 
the alarm box. High frequency 
waves tripped emergency bells 
throughout the camp. As O’Keefe 
burst from his house, lights; al- 
ready flickered on every side. 

“Where?” Fisher demanded 
shrilly. He appeared beside 
O’Keefe, still in his pajamas, 
grubby-faced with sleep. 

“Over to the right.” O’Keefe 



leaped aside for a massive can- 
non being rolled from its under- 
ground storage-chambers. Sol- 
diers were appearing among the 
night-clad figures. To the right 
lay the black bog of mists and 
obese foliage, ferns and pulpy on- 
ions, sunk in the half-liquid ooze 
that made up the surface of 
Betelgeuse II. Nocturnal phos- 
phorescence danced and flitted 
over the bog, ghostly yellow 
lights snapped in the thick dark- 
ness. 

“I figure,” Horstokowski said, 



98

“they came in close to the road, 
but not actually on it. There’s 
a shoulder fifty feet on each side, 
where the bog has piled up. 
That’s why our radar’s silent.” 
An immense mechanical fus- 
ing “bug” was eating its way in- 
to the mud and shifting water of 
the bog, leaving behind a trail 
of hard, smoked surface. The 
vegetation and the rotting roots 
and dead leaves were sucked up 
and efficiently cleared away. 

“What did you see?” Port- 
bane asked O’Keefe. 

“I didn’t see anything. I was 
sound asleep. But I heard them.” 
“Doing what?” 

“They were getting ready to 
pump nerve gas into my house. 
I heard them unreeling the hose 
from portable drums and uncap- 
ping the pressure tanks. But, by 
God, I was out of the house be- 
fore they could get the joints 
leak-tight!” 

r)ANIELS hurried up. “You 
say it’s a gas attack?” He 
fumbled for the gas mask at his 
belt. “Don’t stand there — get 
your masks on!” 

“They didn’t get their equip- 
ment going,” Silberman said. 
“O’Keefe gave the alarm in time. 
They retreated back to the bog.” 
“You’re sure?” Daniels de- 
manded. 

“You don’t smell anything, 
do you?” 



“No,” Daniels admitted. “But 
the odorless type is the most 
deadly. And you don’t know 
you’ve been gased till it’s too 
late.” He put on his gas mask, 
just to be sure. 

A few women appeared by the 
rows of houses — slim, large-eyed 
shapes in the flickering glare of 
the emergency searchlights. Some 
children crept cautiously after 
them. 

Silberman and Horstokowski 
moved over in the shadows by 
the heavy cannon. 

“Interesting,” Horstokowski 
said. “Third gas attack this 
month. Plus two tries to wire 
bomb terminals within the camp 
site. They’re stepping it up.” 

“You have it all figured out, 
don’t you?” 

“I don’t have to wait for the 
composite to see We’re getting it 
heavier all the time.” Horsto- 
kowski peered warily around, 
then pulled Silberman close. 
“Maybe there’s a reason why the 
radar screen didn’t react. It’s 
supposed to get everything, even 
knocker-bats.” 

“But if they came in along the 
shoulder, like you said — ” 

“I just said that as a plant. 
There’s somebody waving them 
in, setting up interference tor the 
radar.” 

“You mean one of us?” 

Horstokowski was intently 
watching Fisher through the 



SHELL GAME 



99 



moist night gloom. Fisher had 
moved carefully to the edge of 
the road, where the hard surface 
ended and the slimy, scorched 
bog began. He was squatting 
down and rooting in the ooze. 

“What’s he doing?” Horsto- 
kowski demanded. 

“Picking up something,” Sil- 
berman said indifferently. “Why 
not? He’s supposed to be looking 
around, isn’t he?” 

“Watch,” Horstokowski warn- 
ed. “When he comes back, he’s 
going to pretend nothing hap- 
pened.” 

PRESENTLY, Fisher returned, 
walking rapidly and rubbing 
the muck from his hands. 

Horstokowski intercepted him. 
“What’d you find?” 

“Me?” Fisher blinked. “I didn’t 
find anything.” 

“Don’t kid me! You were down 
on your hands and knees, grub- 
bing in the bog.” 

“I — thought I saw something 
metal, that’s all.” 

A vast inner excitement radi- 
ated through Horstokowski. He 
had been right. 

“Come on!” he shouted. 
“What’d you find?” 

“I thought it was a gas pipe,” 
Fisher muttered. “But it was only 
a root. A big, wet root.” 

There was a tense silence. 
“Search him,” Portbane or- 
dered. 



Two soldiers grabbed Fisher. 
Silberman and Daniels quickly 
searched him. 

They spilled out his belt pistol, 
knife, emergency whistle, auto- 
matic relay checker, geiger count- 
er, pulse tab, medical kit and 
identification papers. There was 
nothing else. 

The soldiers let him go, dis- 
appointed, and Fisher sullenly 
collected his things. 

“No, he didn’t find anything,” 
Portbane stated. “Sorry, Fisher. 
We have lo be careful. We have 
to watch all the time, as long as 
they’re out there, plotting and 
conspiring against us.” 

Silberman and Horstokowski 
exchanged glances, then moved 
quietly away. 

“I think I get it,” Silberman 
said softly. 

“Sure,” Horstokowski answer- 
ed. “He hid something. We’ll dig 
up that section of bog he was 
poking around in. I think maybe 
we’ll find something interesting.” 
He hunched his shoulders com- 
batively. “I knew somebody was 
working for them, here in the 
camp. A spy for Terra.” 

Silberman started. “Terra? Is 
that who’s attacking us?” 

“Of course that’s who.” 

There was a puzzled look on 
Silberman’s face. 

“Seemed to me we’re fighting 
somebody else.” 

Horstokowski was outraged. 



“For instance?” 

Silberman shook his head. “I 
don’t know. I didn’t think about 
who so much as what to do about 
it. I guess I just took it for grant- 
ed they were aliens.” 

“And what do you think those 
Terran monkey men are?” Hor- 
stokowski challenged. 

T HE weekly Pattern Confer- 
ence brought together the nine 
leaders of the camp in their re- 
inforced underground conference 
chamber. Armed guards protected 
the entrance, which was sealed 
tight as soon as the last leader 
had been examined, checked over 
and finally passed. 

Domgraf-Schwach, the confer- 
ence chairman, sat attentively in 
his deep chair, one hand on the 
Pattern composite, the other on 
the switch that could instantly 
catapult him from the room and 
into a special compartment, safe 
from attack. Portbane was mak- 
ing his routine inspection of the 
chamber, examining each chair 
and desk for scanning eyes. Dan- 
iels sat with eyes fixed on his 
geiger counter. Silberman was 
completely encased in an elabor- 
ate steel and plastic suit, con- 
figured with wiring, from which 
continual whirrings came. 

“What in God’s name is that 
suit of armor?” Domgraf- 
Schwach asked angrily. “Take it 
off so we can see you.” 



“Nuts to you,” Silberman 
snapped, his voice muted by his 
intricate hull. “I’m wearing this 
from now on. Last night, some- 
body tried to jab me with bac- 
teria-impregnated needles.” 
Lanoir, who was half-dozing 
at his place, came alive. “Bac- 
teria-impregnated needles?” He 
leaped up and hurried over to 
Silberman. “Let me ask you if — ” 
“Keep away from me!” Sil- 
berman shouted. “If you come 
any closer, I’ll electrocute you!” 
“The attempt I reported last 
week,” Lanoir panted excitedly, 
“when they tried to poison the 
water supply with metallic salts. 
It occurred to me their next 
method would be bacterial 
wastes, filterable virus we 
couldn’t detect until actual out- 
break of disease.” From his pock- 
et, he yanked a bottle and shook 
out a handful of white capsules. 
One after another, he popped the 
capsules into his mouth. 

Every man in the room was 
protected in some fashion. Each 
chose whatever apparatus con- 
formed to his individual experi-. 
ence. But the totality of defense- 
systems was integrated in the 
general Pattern planning. The on- 
ly man who didn’t seem busy 
with a device was Tate. He sat 
pale and tense, but otherwise un- 
occupied. Domgraf-Schwach 
made a mental note — Tate’s con- 
fidence-level was unusually high.

It suggested he somehow felt 
safe from attack. 

“No talking,” Domgraf- 
Schwach said. “Time to start.” 

He had been chosen as chair- 
manship by the turn of a wheel. 
There was no possibility of sub- 
version under such a system. In 
an isolated, autonomous colony 
of sixty men and fifty women, 
such a random method was neces- 
sary. 

“Daniels will read the week’s 
Pattern composite,” Domgraf- 
Schwab ordered. 

“Why?” Portbane demanded 
bluntly. “We were the ones who 
put it together. We all know 
what’s in it.” 

“For the same reason it’s al- 
ways read,” Silberman answered. 
“So we’ll know it wasn’t tamper- 
ed with.” 

“Just the summation!” Hor- 
stokowski said loudly. “I don’t 
want to stay down here in this 
vault any longer than I have to.” 

“Afraid somebody’ll fill up the 
passage?” Daniels jeered. “There 
are half a dozen emergency es- 
cape exits. You ought to know — 
you insisted on every one of 
them.” 

“Read the summation,” Lan- 
oir demanded. 

D ANIELS cleared his throat. 

“During the last seven days, 
there were eleven overt attacks in 
all. The main attack was on our 



new class-A bridge network, 
which was sabotaged and wreck- 
ed. The struts were weakened 
and the plastic mix that served 
as base material was diluted, so 
that when the very first convoy 
of trucks passed over it, the whole 
thing collapsed.” 

“We know that,” Portbane said 
gloomily. 

“Loss consisted of six lives and 
considerable equipment. Troops 
scoured the area for a whole day, 
but the saboteurs managed to es- 
cape. Shortly after this attack, it 
was discovered that the water 
supply was poisoned with metal- 
lic salts. The wells were there- 
fore filled and new ones drilled. 
Now all our water passes through 
filter and analysis systems.” 

“I boil mine,” Lanoir added 
feelingly. 

“It’s agreed by everyone that 
the frequency and severity of at- 
tacks have been stepped up.” 
Daniels indicated the massive 
wall charts and graphs. “With- 
out our bomb-proof screen and 
our constant detection network, 
we’d be overwhelmed tonight. 
The real question is — who are 
our attackers?'' 

“Terrans,” Horstokowski said. 

Tate shook his head. “Terrans, 
hell! What would monkey men 
be doing out this far?” 

“We’re out this far, aren’t we?” 
Lanoir retorted. “And we were 
Terrans once.”

“Never!” Fisher shouted. 
“Maybe we lived on Terra, but 
we aren’t Terrans. We’re a su- 
perior mutant race.” 

“Then who are they?” Horsto- 
kowski insisted. 

“They’re other survivors from 
the ship,” Tate said. 

“How do you know?” asked 
Silberman. “Have you ever seen 
them?” ' 

“We salvaged no lifeboats, 
remember? They must have 
blasted off in them.” 

“If they were isolated sur- 
vivors,” O’Keefe objected, “they 
wouldn’t have the equipment and 
weapons and machines they’re 
using. They’re a trained, inte- 
grated force. We haven’t been 
able to defeat them or even kill 
any of them in five years. That 
certainly shows their strength.” 

“We haven’t tried to defeat 
them,” Fisher said. “We’ve only 
tried to defend ourselves.” 

A sudden tense silence fell over 
the nine men. 

“You mean the ship,” Horsto- 
kowski said. 

“It’ll be up out of the bog 
soon,” Tate replied. “And then 
we’ll have something to show 
them — something they’ll remem- 
ber.” 

“Good God!” Lanoir exclaim- 
ed, disgusted. “The ship’s a 
wreck — the meteor completely 
smashed it. What happens when 
we do get it up? We can’t oper- 



ate it unless we can completely 
rebuild it.” 

“If the monkey men could 
build the thing,” Portbane said, 
“we can repair it. We have the 
tools and machinery.” 

“And we’ve finally located the 
control cabin,” O’Keefe pointed 
out. “I see no reason why we 
can’t raise it.” 

There was an abrupt change 
of expression on Lanoir’s face. 
“All right, I withdraw my objec- 
tions. Let’s get it up.” 

“What’s your motive?” Daniels 
yelled excitedly. “You’re trying 
to put something over on us!” 
“He’s planning something,” 
Fisher furiously agreed. “Don’t 
listen to him. Leave the damn 
thing down there!” 

“Too late for that,” O’Keefe 
said. “It’s been rising for weeks.” 
“You’re in with him!” Daniels 
screeched. “Something’s being put 
over on us!” 

IT’HE ship was a dripping, cor- 
roded ruin. Slime poured from 
it as the magnetic grapples drag- 
ged it from the bog and onto the 
hard surface that the fusing bugs 
had laid down. 

The bugs burned a hard track 
through the bog, out to the con- 
trol cabin. While the lift sus- 
pended the cabin, heavy rein- 
forced plastic beams were slid 
under it. Tangled weeds, matted 
like ancient hair, covered the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



globular cabin in the midday 
sun, the first light that had struck 
it in five years. 

“In you go,” Domgraf-Schwach 
said eagerly. 

Portbane and Lanoir advanced 
over the fused surface to the 
moored control cabin. Their 
handlights flashed ominously yel- 
low around the steaming walls 
and encrusted controls. Livid eels 
twisted and convulsed in the 
thick pools underfoot. The cabin 
was a smashed, twisted ruin. Lan- 
oir, who was first, motioned Port- 
bane impatiently after him. 

“You look at these controls — 
you’re the engineer.” 

Portbane set down his light on 
a sloping heap of rusted metal 
and sloshed through the knee- 
deep rubbish to the demolished 
control panel. It was a maze of 
fused, buckled machinery. He 
squatted down in front of it and 
began tearing away the pitted 
guard-plates. 

Lanoir pushed open a supply 
closet and brought down metal- 
packed audio and video tapes. 
He eagerly spilled open a can 
of the video and held a handful 
of frames to the flickering light. 
“Here’s the ship’s data. Now I’ll 
be able to prove there was no- 
body but us aboard.” 

O’Keefe appeared at the jag- 
ged doorway. “How’s it coming?” 

Lanoir elbowed past him and 
out on tfie support boards. He de- 

SHELL GAME 



posited a load of tape -cans and 
returned to the drenched cabin. 
“Find anything on the controls?” 
he asked Portbane. 

“Strange,” Portbane murmur- 
ed. 

“What’s the matter?” Tate de- 
manded. “Too badly wrecked?” 

“There are lots of wires and 
relays. Plenty of meters and 
power circuits and switches. But 
no controls to operate them.” 

Lanoir hurried over. “There 
must be!” 

“For repairs, you have to re- 
move all these plates — practically 
dismantle the works to even see 
them. Nobody could sit here and 
control the ship. There’s nothing 
but a smooth, sealed shell.” 

“Maybe this wasn’t the control 
cabin,” Fisher offered. 

“This is the steering mechan- 
ism — no doubt about that.” Port- 
bane pulled out a heap of 
charred wiring. “But all this was 
self-contained. They’re robot con- 
trols. Automatic.” 

They looked at each other. 

“Then we were prisoners,” Tate 
said, dazed. 

“Whose?” , Fisher asked baf- 
fledly. 

“The Terrans!” Lanoir said. 

“I don’t get it,” Fisher mutter- 
ed vaguely. “We planned the 
whole flight — didn’t we? We 
broke out of Ganymede and got 
away.” 

“Get the tapes going,” Port- 



104 



105 



bane said to Lanoir. “Let’s see 
what’s in them.” 

D ANIELS snapped the vidtape 
scanner off and raised the 
light. 

“Well,” he said, “you saw for 
yourselves this was a hospital 
ship. It carried no crew. It was 
directed from a central guide- 
beam at Jupiter. The beam car- 
ried it from the Sol System here, 
where, because of a mechanical 
error, a meteor penetrated the 
protection screen and the ship 
crashed.” 

“And if it hadn’t crashed?” 
Domgraf-Schwach asked faintly. 

“Then we would have been 
taken to the main hospital at 
Fomalhaut IV.” 

“Play the last tape again,” 
Tate urged. 

The wall -speaker spluttered 
and then said smoothly: “The 
distinction between paranoids 
and paranoiac syndromes in other 
psychotic personality disorders 
must be borne in mind when deal- 
ing with these patients. The para- 
noid retains his general per- 
sonality structure unimpaired. 
Outside of the region of his com- 
plex, he is logical, rational, even 
brilliant. He can be talked to — 
he can discuss himself — he is 
aware of his surroundings. 

“The paranoid differs from 
other psychotics in that he re- 
mains actively oriented to the 



outside world. He differs from so- 
called normal personality types 
in that he has a set of fixed ideas, 
false postulates from which he 
has relentlessly constructed an 
elaborate system of beliefs, logi- 
cal and consistent with these false 
postulates.” 

Shakily, Daniels interrupted 
the tape. “These tapes were for 
the hospital authorities on Fo- 
malhaut IV. Locked in a supply 
closet in the control cabin. The 
control cabin itself was sealed off 
from the rest of the ship. None of 
us was able to enter it.” 

“The paranoid is totally rigid,” 
the calm voice of the Terran doc- 
tor continued. “His fixed ideas 
cannot be shaken. They domin- 
ate his life. He logically weaves 
all events, all persons, all chance 
remarks and happenings, into his 
system. He is convinced the 
world is plotting against him — 
that he is a person of unusual 
importance and ability against 
whom endless machinations are 
directed. To thwart these plots, 
the paranoid goes to infinite 
lengths to protect himself. He re- 
peatedly vidtapes the authorities, 
constantly moves from place to 
place and, in the dangerous final 
phases, may even become — ” 

Silberman snapped it off sav- 
agely and the chamber was silent. 
The nine leaders of the camp sat 
unmoving in their places. 

“We’re a bunch of nuts,” Tate 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



said finally. “A shipload of psy- 
chos who got wrecked by a 
chance meteor.” 

“Don’t kid yourself,” Horsto- 
kowski snapped. “There wasn’t 
anything chance about that me- 
teor.” 

Fisher giggled hysterically. 
“More paranoid talk. Good God, 
all these attacks — hallucinations 
— all in our minds!” 

T ANOIR poked vaguely at the 
piles of tape. “What are we 
to believe? Are there any attack- 
ers?” 

“We’ve been defending our- 
selves against them for five 
years!” Portbane retorted. “Isn’t 
that proof enough?” 

“Have you ever seen them?” 
Fisher asked slyly. 

“We’re up against the best 
agents in the Galaxy. Terran 
shock troops and military spies, 
carefully trained in subversion 
and sabotage. They’re too clever 
to show themselves.” 

“They wrecked the bridge- 
system,” O’Keefe said. “It’s true 
we didn’t see them, but the bridge 
is sure as hell in ruins.” 

“Maybe it was badly built,” 
Fisher pointed out. “Maybe it 
just collapsed.” 

“Things don’t ‘just collapse’! 
There’s a reason for all these 
things that have been happening.” 
“Like what?” Tate demanded. 
“Weekly poison gas attacks,” 

SHELL GAME 



Portbane said. “Metallic wastes 
in the water supply, to name only 
two.” 

“And bacteriological crystals,” 
Daniels added. 

“Maybe none of these things 
exist,” Lanoir argued. “But how 
are we to prove it? If we’re all 
insane, how would we know?” 
“There are over a hundred 
of us,” Domgraf-Schwach said. 
“We’ve all experienced these at- 
tacks. Isn’t that proof enough?” 
“A myth can be picked up by 
a whole society, believed and 
taught to the next generation. 
Gods, fairies, witches — believing 
a thing doesn’t make it true. For 
centuries, Terrans believed the 
Earth was flat.” 

“If all foot -rulers grow to thir- 
teen inches,” Fisher asked, “how 
would anybody know? One of 
them would have to stay twelve 
inches long, a non-variable, a 
constant. We’re a bunch of in- 
accurate rulers, each thirteen 
inches long. We need one non- 
paranoid for comparison.” 

“Or maybe this is all part of 
their strategy,” Siberman said. 
“Maybe they rigged up that con- 
trol cabin and planted those tapes 
there.” 

“This ought to be no different 
from trying to test any belief,” 
Portbane explained. “What’s the 
characteristic of a scientific test?” 
“It can be duplicated,” Fisher 
said promptly. “Look, we’re go- 



107 



ing around in circles. We’re try- 
ing to measure ourselves. You 
can’t take your ruler, either 
twelve inches or thirteen inches 
long, and ask it to measure it- 
self. No instrument can test its 
own accuracy.” 

“Wrong,” Portbane answered 
calmly. “I can put together a 
valid, objective test.” 

“There’s no such test!” Tate 
shouted excitedly. 

“There sure as hell is. And in- 
side of a week, I’ll have it set up.” 

AS !” the soldier shouted. On 
Vj all sides, sirens wailed into 
life. Women and children scram- 
bled for their masks. Heavy-duty 
cannon rumbled up from sub- 
surface chambers and took up 
positions. Along the perimeter of 
the bog, the fusing bugs were 
searing away a ribbon of muck. 
Searchlights played out into the 
fern-thick darkness. 

Portbane snapped off the cock 
of the steel tank and signaled the 
workmen. The tank was rolled 
quickly away from the sea of 
mud and seared weeds. 

“All right,” Portbane gasped. 
“Get it below.” 

He emerged in the subsurface 
chamber as the cylinder was be- 
ing rolled into position. 

“That cylinder,” Portbane said, 
“should contain hydrocyanic va- 
por. It’s a sampling made at the 
site of the attack.” 



“This is useless,” Fisher com- 
plained. “They’re attacking and 
here we stand!” 

Portbane signaled the work- 
men and they began laying out 
the test apparatus. “There will 
be two samples, precipitates of 
different vapors, each clearly 
marked and labeled A and B. 
One comes from the cylinder fill- 
ed at the scene of the attack. The 
other is condensed from air taken 
out of this room.” 

“Suppose we describe both as 
negative?” Silberman asked wor- 
riedly. “Won’t that throw your 
test off?” 

“Then we’ll take more tests. 
After a couple of months, if we 
still haven’t got anything but 
negative, findings, then the attack 
hypothesis is destroyed.” 

“We may see both as posi- 
tive,” Tate said, perplexed. 

“In that case, we’re dead right 
now. If we see both samples as 
positive, I think the case for the 
paranoid hypothesis has been 
proved.” 

After a moment, Domgraf- 
Schwach reluctantly agreed. “One 
is the control. If we maintain that 
it isn’t possible to get a control 
sample that is free of hydrocyanic 
acid ...” 

“Pretty damn slick,” O’Keefe 
admitted. “You start from the one 
known factor — our own existence. 
We can’t very well doubt that.” 
“Here are all the choices,” 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Portbane said. “Both positive 
means we’re psychotic. Both 
negative means either the attack 
was a false alarm or there are 
no attackers. One positive and one 
negative would indicate there are 
real attackers, that we’re fully 
sane and rational.” He glanced 
around at the camp leads. “ But 
we’ll all have to agree which 
sample is which.” 

“Our reactions will be record- 
ed secretly?” Tate asked. 

“Tabulated and punched by 
the mechanical eye. Tallied by 
machinery. Each of us will make 
an individual discrimination.” 

A FTER a pause, Fisher said, 
“I’ll try it.” He came for- 
ward, leaned over the colori- 
meter and studied the two sam- 
ples intently. He alternated them 
for a time and then firmly grab- 
bed the check-stylus. 

“You’re sure?” Domgraf- 
Schwach asked. “You really 
know which is the negative con- 
trol sample?” 

“I know.” Fisher noted his find- 
ings on the punch sheet and 
moved away. 

“I’m next,” Tate said, impa- 
tiently pushing up. “Let’s get this 
over with.” 

One by one, the men examined 
the two samples, recorded their 
findings, and then moved off to 
stand waiting uneasily. 

“All right,” Portbane said 



finally. “I’m the last one.” He 
peered down briefly, scribbled his 
results, then pushed the equip- 
ment away. “Give me the read- 
ings,” he told the workmen by 
the scanner. 

A moment later, the findings 
were flashed up for everyone to 
see.

said softly. “As simple as that. 
We’re paranoids.” 

“You cluck!” Tate shouted at 
Horstokowski. “It was A, not B! 
How the hell could you get it 
wrong?” 

“B was as bright as a search- 
light!” Domgraf-Schwach an- 
swered furiously. “A was com- 
pletely colorless!” 

O’Keefe pushed forward. 
“Which was it, Portbane? Which 
was the positive sample?” 

“I don’t know,” Portbane con- 
fessed. “How could any of us 
be sure?” 

T HE buzzer on Domgraf- 
Schwach’s desk clicked and he 
snapped on the vidscreen.

The face of a soldier-operator 
appeared. “The attack’s over, sir. 
We drove them away.” 

Domgraf-Schwach smiled iron- 
ically. “Catch any of them?” 
“No, sir. They slipped back into 
the bog. I think we hit a couple, 
though. We’ll go out tomorrow 
and try to find the corpses.” 
“You think you’ll find them?” 
“Well, the bog usually swal- 
lows them up. But maybe this 
time — ” 

“All right,” Domgraf-Schwach 
interrupted. “If this turns out to 
be an exception, let me know.” 
He broke the circuit. 

“Now what?” Daniels inquired 
icily. 

“There’s no point in continu- 
ing work on the ship,” O’Keefe 
said. “Why waste our time bomb- 
ing empty bogs?” 

“I suggest we keep working 
on the ship,” Tate contradicted. 
“Why?” O’Keefe asked. 

“So we can head for Fomalhaut 
and give ourselves up to the hos- 
pital station.” 

Silberman stared at him in- 
credulously. “Turn ourselves in? 
Why not stay here? We’re not 
harming anybody.” 

“No, not yet. It’s the future 
I’m thinking of, centuries from 
now.” 

“We’ll be dead.” 

“Those of us in this room, sure, 
but what about our descen- 
dants?” 



“He’s right,” Lanoir conceded. 
“Eventually our descendants will 
fill this whole solar system. Soon- 
er or later, our ships might 
spread over the Galaxy.” He 
tried to smile, but his muscles 
would not respond. “The tapes 
point out how tenacious para- 
noids are. They cling fanatically 
to their fixed beliefs. If our de- 
scendants expand into Terran re- 
gions, there’ll be a fight and we 
might win because we’re more 
one-track. We would never de- 
viate.” 

“Fanatics,” Daniels whispered. 

“We’ll have to keep this infor- 
mation from the rest of the 
camp,” O’Keefe said. 

“Absolutely,” Fisher agreed. 
“We’ll have to keep them think- 
ing the ship is for H-bomb at- 
tacks. Otherwise, we’ll have one 
hell of a situation on our hands.” 

They began moving numbly 
toward the sealed door. 

“Wait a minute,” Domgraf- 
Schwach said urgently. “The 
two workmen.” He started back, 
while some of them went out 
into the corridor, the rest back 
toward their seats. 

And then it happened. 

S ILBERMAN fired first. Fisher 
screamed as half of him van- 
ished in swirling particles of 
radioactive ash. Silberman drop- 
ped to his one knee and fired up 
at Tate. Tate leaped back and 



no 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



brought out his own B-pistol. 
Daniels stepped from the path of 
Lanoir’s beam. It missed him 
and struck the first row of seats. 

Lanoir calmly crept along the 
wall through the billowing clouds 
of smoke. A figure loomed ahead; 
he raised his gun and fired. The 
figure fell to one side and fired 
back. Lanoir staggered and col- 
lapsed like a deflated balloon and 
Silberman hurried on. 

At his desk, Domgraf-Schwach 
was groping wildly for his es- 
cape button. His fingers touched 
it, but as he depressed the stud, 
a blast from Portbane’s pistol 
removed the top of his head. The 
lifeless corpse stood momentarily, 
then was whisked to “safety” by 
the intricate apparatus beneath 
the desk. 

“This way!” Portbane shout- 
ed, above the sizzle of the B- 
blasts. “Come on, Tate!” 

Various beams were turned in 
his direction. Half the chamber 
burst apart and thundered down, 
disintegrating into rubble and 
flaming debris. He and Tate 
scrambled for one of the emer- 
gency exits. Behind them, the 
others hurried, firing savagely. 

Horstokowski found the exit 
and slid past the jammed lock. 
He fired as the two figures raced 
up the passage ahead of him. 
One of them stumbled, but the 
other grabbed at him and they 
hobbled off together. Daniels was 



a better shot. As Tate and Port- 
bane emerged on the surface, one 
of Daniels’ blasts undercut the 
taller of the two. 

Portbane continued running a 
little way, and then silently 
pitched face-forward against the 
side of a plastic house, a gloomy 
square of opaque blackness 
against the night sky. 

“Where’d they go?” Silberman 
demanded hoarsely, as he ap- 
peared at the mouth of the pas- 
sage. His right arm had been torn 
away by Lanoir’s blast. The 
stump was seared hard. 

“I got one of them.” Daniels 
and O’Keefe approached the 
inert figure warily. “It’s Port- 
bane. That leaves Tate. We got 
three of the four. Not bad, on 
such short notice.” 

“Tate’s damn smart,” Silber- 
man panted. “I think he sus- 
pected.” 

He scanned the darkness 
around them. Soldiers, return- 
ing from the gas attack, came 
hurrying up. Searchlights rum- 
bled toward the scene of the 
shooting. Off in the distance, 
sirens wailed. 

“Which way did he go?” Dan- 
iels asked. 

“Over toward the bog.” 

/"VKEEFE moved cautiously 
along the narrow street. The 
others came slowly behind. 

“You were the first to realize,” 



SHELL GAME 



111 



Horstokowski said to Silberman. 
“For a while, I believed the test. 
Then I realized we were being 
tricked — the four of them were 
plotting in unison.” 

“I didn’t expect four of them,” 
Silberman admitted. “I knew 
there was at least one Terran spy 
among us. But Lanoir ...” 

“I always knew Lanoir was a 
Terran agent,” O’Keefe declared 
flatly. “I wasn’t surprised at the 
test results. They gave themselves 
away by faking their findings.” 
Silberman waved over a group 
of soldiers. “Have Tate picked up 
and brought here. He’s some- 
where at the periphery of the 
camp.” 

The soldiers hurried away, 
dazed and muttering. Alarm bells 
dinned shrilly on all sides. Fig- 
ures scampered back and forth. 
Like a disturbed ant colony, the 
whole camp was alive with ex- 
citement. 

“In other words,” Daniels said, 
“the four of them really saw the 
same as we. They saw B as the 
positive sample, but they put 
down A instead.” 

“They knew we’d put down 
B,” O’Keefe said, “since B was 
the positive sample taken from 
the attack site. All they had to 
do was record the opposite. The 
results seemed to substantiate 
Lanoir’s paranoid theory, which 
was why Portbane set up the 
test in the first place. It was 



planned a long time ago — part 
of their overall job.” 

“Lanoir dug up the tapes in 
the first place!” Daniels exclaim- 
ed. “Fisher and he planted them 
down in the ruins of the ship. 
Portbane got us to accept his test- 
ing device.” 

“What were they trying to do?” 
Silberman asked suddenly. ‘Why 
were they trying to convince us 
we’re paranoids?” 

“Isn’t it obvious?” O’Keefe re- 
plied. “They wanted us to turn 
ourselves in. The Terran monkey 
men naturally are trying to choke 
off the race that’s going to sup- 
plant them. We won’t surrender, 
of cpurse. The four of them were 
clever — they almost had me con- 
vinced. When the results flashed 
up five to four, I had a momen- 
tary doubt. But then I realized 
what an intricate strategy they 
had worked out.” 

Horstokowski examined his B- 
pistol. “I’d like to get hold of 
Tate and wring the whole story 
from him, the whole damn ac- 
count of their planning, so we’d 
have it in black and white.” 
“You’re still not convinced?” 
Daniels inquired. 

“Of course. But I’d like to hear 
him admit it.” 

“I doubt if we’ll see Tate 
again,” O’Keefe said. “He must 
have reached the Terran lines 
by now. He’s probably sitting in 
a big inter-system military trans- 



112 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



port, giving his story to gold- 
braid Terran officials. I’ll bet 
they’re moving up heavy guns 
and shock troops while we stand 
here.” 

“We’d better get busy,” Dan- 
iels said sharply. “We’ll repair 
the ship and load it with H- 
bombs. After we wipe out their 
bases here, we’ll carry the war to 
them. A few raids on the Sol 
System ought to teach them to 
leave us alone.” 

Horstokowski grinned. “It’ll be 
an uphill fight — we’re alone 
against a whole galaxy. But I 
think we’ll take care of them. 
One of us is worth a million 
Terran monkey men.” 

tiiATE lay trembling in the dark 
-B- tangle of weeds. Dripping 
black stalks of nocturnal vege- 
tables clutched and stirred 
around him. Poisonous night in- 
sects slithered across the surface 
of the fetid bog. 

He was covered with slime. 
His clothing was torn and rip- 



ped. Somewhere along the way, 
he had lost Jiis B-pistol. His 
right shoulder ached; he could 
hardly move his arm. Bones 
broken, probably. He was top 
numb and dazed to care. He lay 
face-down in the sticky muck 
and closed his eyes. 

He didn’t have a chance. No- 
body survived in the bogs. He 
feebly smashed an insect oozing 
across his neck. It squirmed in 
his hand and then, reluctantly, 
died. For a long time, its dead 
legs kicked. 

The probing stalk of a sting- 
ing snail began tracing webs 
across Tate’s inert body. As the 
sticky pressure of the snail crept 
heavily onto him, he heard the 
first faint far-off sounds of the 
camp going into action. For a 
time, it meant nothing to him. 
Then he understood — and shud- 
dered miserably, helplessly. 

The first phase of the big of- 
fensive against Earth was already 
moving into high gear.

Would perfect, omnipresent robots, who would do all the work for the human 
race and release people for purely creative activities, be good for us? Is the old 
saw true, that unending toil is the lot of man and that without work the human 
being would become a listless, hedonistic, degenerate thing? Or can a future be 
envisaged in which mankind has advanced, through psychological and mental train* 
ing, to a point where he can surmount his own baser nature and become truly a 
rational and happy being, to whom leisure is a creative boon? 

These. are the questions posed in this strange and somehow frightening science-

BRAIN WAVE by Poul Ander- 
son. Ballantine Books, cloth 
$2.50, paper 35c 

T^XCEPT for a rather fumbling 
ending, this is one of the best 
of the Ballantine science fiction 
novels. 

Imagine a situation in which 
the Earth moves, in the normal 
course of events, out of a region 
of the Galaxy containing radia- 
tions that have, for uncounted 
millions of years, slightly damp- 
ed the electromagnetic pheno- 
mena of our world, into an area 
entirely free of such radiations. 
And consider how such a speed- 



ing up of the electromagnetic 
forces might react on the minute 
neurones of the brain. 

Anderson postulates that, in 
such a situation, intelligence lev- 
els would increase about 250% — 
including every kind of animal 
as well as human beings. The 
author further assumes that the 
change cannot affect animals’ or 
people’s glandular reactions, their 
emotions, their fears or their de- 
sires. These grosser functions re- 
main as they always have been. 
The results are awesome. 

It is an original idea and is 
brilliantly carried out in a dra- 
matic counterpoint of what hap-

pens to pigs, biochemists, rabbits, 
farmhands, religious fanatics, 
dogs, morons, sociologists, tigers, 
physicists — and civilization. 

In the end, the development 
seems to me to become too gran- 
diose and almost fuzzy, but I 
think you will agree that, on the 
whole, this is a first-rate book. 

HUMAN? edited by Judith Mer- 
ril. Lion Books, 25c 

S CIENCE fiction’s only lady 
anthologist is also one of the 
best in the business — mainly be- 
cause she follows none of the 
established patterns. 

Her newest contains 15 stories 
and the main characters in every 
one of them definitely rate the 
question mark after the one -word 
title. Eight of the tales score A 
and 6 are B on my scale of values, 
and there is enough variety to 
satisfy the most jaded appetite. 

Six of the tales have appeared 
in books by their authors, though 
none in anthology. Unfortunate- 
ly, there is no indication of the 
previous book appearances in the 
cases of Sprague de Camp and 
Theodore Sturgeon. 

The author list includes Don 
Marquis, H. G. Wells and John 
Collier, as well as the two men- 
tioned above, plus Eric Frank 
Russell, Isaac Asimov, John D. 
MacDonald, Iris Seabright 
(whose “Egg a Month from All 



Over” is my favorite in the col- 
lection), Fritz Leiber, Algis Bud- 
rys, August Derleth, Graham 
Doar, and Walter. M. Miller, Jr. 

Like all the previous Merril 
collections, this book contains a 
number of items from the fan- 
tasy side of the ledger (Marquis, 
Wells, Collier, Sturgeon), but this 
is okay by me, and I think it will 
be by you. 

LOST CONTINENTS by L. 
Sprague de Camp. Gnome Press, 
$5.00 

I F there is anything you want 
to know about the cults of 
Mu, Atlantis, Lemuria, Gon- 
dwanaland; if you are curious 
about the magnificent idiocies of 
Theosophy, Rosicrucianism, and 
a couple of dozen other occult 
cosmogonies; if you want, in 
short, to have a richly document- 
ed and entertaining survey of 
how crazy the crackpots can get, 
this is the book for you. 

I found it enthralling from first 
page to last — and that’s a lot of 
pages, 360 of them. It covers 
everyone from Plato to Ignatius 
Donnelly, from Ortelius to Veli- 
kovsky, from Francis Bacon to 
the pathetic and pitiable Richard 
Shaver. 

A monument of scholarship, 
the book is at the same time 
thoroughly readable. It should be

OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS 
by William Term. Ballantine 
Books, 35c 

A BOUT the best part of this 
rather various collection of 
Tenn short stories is its intro- 
duction, “The Fiction in Science 
Fiction” — a sdfind and judicious 
look at modern science fiction’s 
problems and possibilities by a 
partisan yet still critical practi- 
tioner in the field. 

The seven short stories and 
novelets included in the book are 
all peculiarly Tenn, all readable, 
and several first-rate. The very 
best of Tenn, however, has ap- 
peared in other editors’ antholo- 
gies, and none of the stories in 
this collection has ever seen book 
publication before. 

This means that farces like 
“Liberation of Earth’’ and 
“Everybody Loves Irving Bom- 
mer” — not among Tenn’s top ten 
— are run in along with such ex- 
cellent items as “The Tenants,” 
“The Custodian,” “The Remark- 
able Flirgleflip,” and so on. 

Still, it is eminently worth the 
price. 

THE SECOND CONQUEST by 
Louis de Wohl. J. B. Lippincott 
Co., $3.00 



I'T'HIS is unquestionably one of 
the most peculiar items in the 
whole history of science fiction. 
It is, absolutely literally, the 
struggle between God and the 
Devil to take over the Martians. 
And, in addition, it is one of the 
most ineptly done pieces of ro- 
mantic theology I have ever 
read. 

You start out with a privately 
invented spaceship. It’s pow- 
ered by the fuel “celestium,” 
which has been stolen from a 
wrecked Flying Saucer. You have 
a girl stowaway. And you have 
God’s representative, in the per- 
son of Chris, the pilot; the man 
who is possessed of the Devil in 
Marmon, the evil promoter; and 
blind and stupid science in Bran- 
deis, the technician. Who the' girl 
is, I haven’t yet figured out — not 
Eve, certainly. 

The Martians, nice people 
though they are, have never 
learned about Good and Evil, 
and that is almost too bad for 
them. They nearly “fall,” just as 
did the human race in Eden. 
However, the Man of God 
(Chris) wins in the end, and 
Mars — and our world, too — is 
saved, for the time being, at 
least. 

Religion and science fiction 
are not at all incompatible, any 
more than religion and science 
are. But a noble theme is no 
excuse for poor craftsmanship.

gateway to elsewhere 

by Murray Leinster; T HE 
WEAPON SHOPS by A. E. van 
Vogt. Ace Books, 35c 

T HE third bargain in Don 
Wollheim’s new paper book 
series contains one of van Vogt’s 
best super-duper tales (if you 
haven’t read it before, don’t miss 
it here!) and a Leinster never 
before published in book form, 
though it should have been. 

Gateway to Elsewhere, which 
had magazine publication in 
1951, is a very light, lively and 
amusing pastiche on one of the 
author’s favorite ideas, the com- 
plications resulting from inter- 
connections between two parallel 
worlds. 

Here he imagines a world, 
parallel to ours, in which djinns 
and efreets are real and have 
their own highly individual char- 
acteristics. There is also a pleas- 
ant young this-world hero, name' 
of Tony Gregg, who has a bother- 
some New England conscience, 
which nevertheless does not in- 
hibit him much. 

A richly contrived plot makes 
this improbable assortment of 
characters into a very acceptable 
way of passing a couple of relax- 
ing hours. 

THE MARS PROJECT by 
Wernher von Braun. University 
of Illinois Press, $3.95 



I N addition to being one of the 
most beautifully designed and . 
printed books of 1953 (it was 
chosen as one of the 50 best books 
of the year by the American In- 
stitute of Graphic Arts), this slim 
— under 100 pages — volume is 
also a valuable though highly 
technical report on the innumer- 
able problems, and some of the 
possibilities, of interplanetary 
flight. 

It really is not for laymen, but 
for engineers and similarly pre- 
trained people. However, even 
the ordinary reader can, if he is 
sufficiently interested and knows 
how to skip judiciously, get a 
vivid picture of what one of the 
world’s top experts on the subject 
thinks a project for a flight to 
Mars — and the flight itself, round 
trip — would involve. 

The book is based on material 
by von Braun that appeared in 
the German magazine Weltraum- 
fahrt in 1952.

A NY ONE who makes science 
fiction a serious hobby will 
almost have to have this remark- 
able book. It is a 155-page vol- 
ume, 8 by 12^ inches in size, 
which was compiled and beauti- 
fully mimeographed by a devot- 
ed amateur who lives in Hobart, 
Tasmania, an island province of 
Australia. 

Its first 107 pages consist of 
an encyclopedic listing of impor- 
tant books, authors, magazines, 



and story series, all with brief 
descriptive notes and biographies 
— the tables of contents of all 
anthologies are given in full! 

The appendices contain lists of 
all the pertinent magazines, dead 
or alive, with charts of every 
issue of each one published to 
mid- 1953; pseudonyms; paper- 
books (most of them not in the 
first section of the book); names 
and addresses of book and maga- 
zine publishers in the field; and 
a supplementary list of authors, 
mainly addenda to the names in 
the first encyclopedic part. 

Even though not absolutely 
complete, the book nevertheless 
is worth its very low price.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



MILK RUN 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



What are Smags, Firgels and 
Queels? Cats in a bag . and 
Gregor was holding the bag! 






"E can’t pass it up,” 
Arnold was saying. 
“Millions in profits, 
small initial investment, immedi- 
ate return. Are you listening?” 
Richard Gregor nodded weari- 
ly. It was a very dull day in the 
offices of the AAA Ace Inter- 
planetary Decontamination Serv- 
ice, exactly like every other day. 
Gregor was playing solitaire. Ar- 
nold, his partner, was at his desk, 
his feet propped on a pile of un- 
paid bills. 

Shadows moved past their glass 
door, thrown by people going to 
Mars Steel, Neo-Roman Novel- 
ties, Alpha Dura Products, or any 
other offices on the same floor. 



But nothing broke the dusty 
silence in AAA Ace. 

“What are we waiting for?” 
Arnold demanded loudly. “Do 
we do it or don’t we?” 

“It’s not our line,” Gregor 
said. “We’re planetary decon- 
taminationists. Remember?” 
“But no one wants a planet de- 
contaminated,” Arnold stated. 

That, unfortunately, was true. 
After successfully cleansing Ghost 
V of imaginary monsters, AAA 
Ace had had a short rush of 
business. But then expansion into 
space had halted. People were 
busy consolidating their gains, 
building towns, plowing fields, 
constructing roads.

The movement would begin 
again. The human race would ex- 
pand as long as there was any- 
thing to expand into. But, for the 
moment, business was terrible. 

“Consider the possibilities,” 
Arnold said. “Here are all these 
people on their bright, shiny new 
worlds. They need farm and food 
animals shipped from home — ” 
he paused dramatically — “by us.” 
“We’re not equipped to handle 
livestock,” Gregor pointed out. 

“We have a ship. What else 
do we need?” 

^“Everything. Mostly knowl- 
edge and experience. Transport- 
ing live animals through space is 
extremely delicate work. It’s a 
job for experts. What would you 
do if a cow came down with hoof- 
and-mouth-disease between here 
and Omega IV?” 

A RNOLD said confidently, 
“We will ship only hardy, 
mutated species. We will have 
them medically examined. And 
I will personally sterilize the ship 
before they come on board.” 

“All right, dreamer,” Gregor 
said. “Prepare yourself for the 
blow. The Trigale Combine does 
all animal shipping in this sector 
of space. They don’t look kindly 
upon competitors — therefore, 
they have no competitors. How 
do you plan to buck them?” 
“We’ll undersell them.” 

“And starve.” 



“We’re starving now,” Arnold 
said. 

“Starving is better than being 
‘accidentally’ holed by a Trigale 
tug at the port of embarkation. 
Or finding that someone has load- 
ed our water tanks with kerosene. 
Or that our oxygen tanks were 
never filled at all.” 

“What an imagination you 
have!” Arnold said nervously. 

“Those figments of my imagi- 
nation have already happened. 
Trigale wants to be alone in the 
field and it is. By accident, you 
might say, if you like gory gags.” 

Just then, the door opened. 
Arnold swung his feet off the 
desk and Gregor swept his cards 
into a drawer. 

Their visitor was an out- 
worlder, to judge by his stocky 
frame, small head and pale green 
skin. He marched directly up to 
Arnold. 

“They’ll be at the Trigale Cen- 
tral Warehouse in three days,” 
he said. 

“So soon, Mr. Vens?” Arnold 
asked. 

“Oh, yes. Had to transport the 
Smags pretty carefully, but the 
Queels have been on hand for 
several days.” 

“Fine. This is my partner,” 
Arnold said, turning to Gregor, 
who was blinking rapidly. 

“Happy.” Vens shook Gregor’s 
hand firmly. “Admire you men. 
Free enterprise, competition — be-

lieve in it. You’ve got the route?” 
“All taped,” Arnold said. “My 
partner is prepared to blast off 
at any moment.” 

“I’ll go directly to Vermoine II 
and meet you there. Good show.” 
He turned and left. 

G REGOR said slowly, “Arnold, 
what have you done?” 

“I’ve been making us rich, 
that’s what I’ve done,” Arnold 
retorted. 

“Shipping livestock?” 

“Yes.” 

“In Trigale territory?” 

“Yes.” 

“Let me see the contract.” 
Arnold produced it. It stated 
that the AAA Ace Planetary 
Decontamination (and Transpor- 
tation) Service promised to de- 
liver five Smags, five Firgels and 
ten Queels to the Vermoine solar 
system. Pickup was to be made 
at the Trigale Central Ware- 
house, delivery to Main Ware- 
house, Vermoine II. AAA Ace 
also had the option of building 
its Own warehouse. 

Said animals were to arrive in- 
tact, alive, healthy, happy, pro- 
ductive, etcetera. There were 
heavy forfeiture clauses in event 
of loss of animals, their arrival 
unalive, unhealthy, unproductive, 
etcetera. 

The document read like a tem- 
porary armistice between un- 
friendly nations. 



“You actually signed this death 
warrant?” Gregor asked incredu- 
ously. 

“Sure. All you have to do is 
pick up the beasts, pop over to 
Vermoine and drop them,” 

“I? And what will you be do- 
ing?” 

“I’ll be right here, backing you 
all the way,” Arnold said. 

“Back me aboard ship.” 

“No, no — impossible. I get 
deathly sick at the very sight of 
a Queel.” 

“And that’s how I feel about 
this deal. Let’s stick your neck 
out for a change.” 

“But I’m the research depart- 
ment,” Arnold objected, perspir- 
ing freely. “We set it up that way. 
Remember?” 

Gregor remembered, sighed 
and shrugged his shoulders help- 
lessly. 

They began at once to put 
their ship in order. The hold was 
divided into three compartments, 
each to carry a separate species. 
All were oxygen breathers and all 
could sustain life at about sev- 
enty degrees Fahrenheit, so that 
was no problem. The correct 
foods were put on board. 

In three days, when they were 
as ready as they would ever be, 
Arnold decided to accompany 
Gregor as far as the Trigale Cen- 
tral Warehouse. 

It was an uneventful trip to 
Trigale, but Gregor landed on 



MILK RUN 



121 



the approach platform with con- 
siderable trepidation. There were 
too many stories about the Com- 
bine for him to feel entirely at 
home in their stronghold. He had 
taken what precautions he could. 
The ship had been completely 
fueled and provisioned at Luna 
Station and no Trigale man 
would be allowed on board. 

However, if the personnel of the 
station were worried about the 
battered old spaceship, they hid 
it nicely. The ship was dragged 
to the. loading platform by a pair 
of tractors and squeezed in be- 
tween two sleek Trigale express 
freighters. 

L EAVING Arnold in charge of 
loading, Gregor went inside 
to sign the manifests. A suave 
Trigale official produced the 
papers and looked on with inter- 
est as Gregor read them over. 

“Loading Smags, eh?” the of- 
ficial inquired politely. 

“That’s right,” Gregor said, 
wondering what a Smag looked 
like. 

“Queels and Firgels, too,” the 
official mused. “Shipping them 
all together. You’ve got a lot of 
courage, Mr. Gregor.” 

“I have? Why?” 

“You know the old saying — 
‘When you travel with Smags, 
don’t forget your magnifying 
glass.’ ” 

“I hadn’t heard that one.” 



The official grinned amiably 
and shook Gregor’s hand. “After 
this trip, you’ll be able to make 
up your own sayings. The very 
best of luck, Mr. Gregor. Unoffi- 
cially, of course.” 

Gregor smiled feebly and re- 
turned to the loading platform. 
The Smags, Firgels and Queels 
were on board, each in their own 
compartment. Arnold had turned 
on the air, checked the tempera- 
ture and given them all a day’s 
ration. 

“Well, you’re off,” Arnold said 
cheerfully. 

“I’m off, all right,” Gregor 
admitted with no cheer whatever. 
He climbed aboard, ignoring a 
faint snicker from the watching 
crowd. 

The ship was tractored to a 
blastoff strip and soon Gregor 
was in space, bound for a tiny 
warehouse circling in orbit 
around Vermoine II. 

There was always plenty to 
do on the first day in space. Gre- 
gor checked his instruments, 
then went over the main drive 
and the tanks, pipes and wiring, 
to make sure nothing had broken 
loose in the blastoff. Then he de- 
cided to inspect his cargo. It was 
about time he found out what 
they looked like. 

The Queels, in the forward 
starboard compartment, looked 
like immense snowballs. Gregor 
knew that they were prized for 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



their wool, which commanded a 
top price everywhere. 

Apparently they hadn’t gotten 
used to free-fall, for their food 
was untouched. He left them 
banking clumsily off walls and 
ceiling and bleating plaintively 
for solid ground. 

The Firgels were no problem at 
all. They were big, leathery liz- 
ards, whose purpose on a farm 
Gregor couldn’t guess. At present, 
they were dormant and would re- 
main so throughout the trip. 

Aft, the five Smags barked 
merrily when they saw him. They 
were friendly, herbivorous mam- 
mals and they seemed to enjoy 
free-fall very much. 

Satisfied, Gregor floated back 
to the control room. It was a 
good beginning. Trigale hadn’t 
bothered him and his animals 
were doing all right in space. 

This trip might be just a milk 
run, he decided. 

After testing his radio and 
control switches, Gregor set the 
alarm and turned in. 

H E awoke, eight hours later, 
unrefreshed and with a split- 
ting headache. His coffee tasted 
like slag and he could barely 
focus on the instrument panel. 

The effects of canned air, he 
decided, and radioed Arnold that 
all was well. But halfway through 
the conversation, he found he 
could hardly keep his eyes open. 



“Signing off,” he said, yawn- 
ing deeply. “Stuffy in here. Go- 
ing to take a nap.” 

“Stuffy?” Arnold asked, his 
voice very distant over the radio. 
“It shouldn’t be. The air cir- 
culators — ” 

Gregor found that the controls 
were swaying drunkenly and be- 
ginning to go out of focus. He 
leaned against the panel and 
closed his eyes. 

“Gregor!" 

“Hmm?” 

“ Gregor ! Check your oxygen 
content!” 

Gregor propped one eye open 
long enough to read the dial. He 
found, to his amusement, that 
the carbon dioxide concentration 
had reached a level he had never 
seen before. 

“No oxygen,” he told Arnold. 
“I’ll fix it after nap.” 

“Sabotage!” Arnold shouted. 
“Wake up, Gregor!” 

With a gigantic effort, Gregor 
reached forward and turned on 
the emergency air tank. The blast 
of air sobered him. He stood up, 
swaying uncertainly, and splash- 
ed some water on his face. 

“The animals!” Arnold was 
screaming. “See about the ani- 
mals!” 

Gregor turned on the auxiliary 
air supply for all three compart- 
ments and hurried down the cor- 
ridor. 

The Firgels were still alive 



MILK RUN 



123 



and dormant. The Smags appar- 
ently hadn’t even noticed the dif- 
ference. Two of the Queels had * 
passed out, but they were re- 
viving. And, in their compart- 
ment, Gregor found out what 
had happened. 

There was no sabotage. The 
ventilators in wall and ceiling, 
through which the ship’s air cir- 
culated, were jammed shut with 
Queel wool. Tufts of fleece float- 
ed in the still air, looking like a 
slow-motion snowfall. 

“Of course, of course,” Ar- 
nold ^aid, when Gregor reported 
by radio. “Didn’t I warn you that 
Queels have to be sheared twice 
a week? No, I guess I forgot to. 
Here’s what the book says: ‘The 
Queel — Queelis Tropicalis — 
is a small, wool-bearing mammal, 
distantly related to the Terran 
Sheep. Queels are natives of 
Tensis V, but have been success- 
fully introduced on other heavy- 
gravity planets. Garments woven 
of Queel wool are fireproof, in- 
sectproof, rotproof and will last 
almost indefinitely, due to the 
metallic content in the wool. 
Queels should be sheared twice a 
week. They reproduce feemish- 
ly.’ ” 

“No sabotage,” Gregor com- 
mented. 

“No sabotage, but you’d bet- 
ter start shearing those Queels,” 
Arnold said. 

Gregor signed off, found a pair 



of tin snips in his tool kit and 
went to work on the Queels. But 
the metallic wool simply blunted 
the cutting edges. It seemed that 
Queels had to be sheared with 
special hard-alloy tools. 

He gathered as much of the 
floating wool as he could find and 
cleared the ventilators again. 
After a last inspection, he went 
to have his supper. 

His beef stew was filled with 
oily, metallic Queel wool. 

Disgusted, he turned in. 

W HEN he awoke, he found 
that the creaking old ship 
was still holding a true course. 
Her main drive was operating ef- 
ficiently and the outlook seemed 
much brighter, especially after 
he found that the Firgels were 
still dormant and the Smags were 
doing nicely. 

But when Gregor inspected the 
Queels, he found that they had- 
n’t touched a morsel of food since 
coming on board. It was serious 
now. He called Arnold for ad- 
vice. 

“Very simple,” Arnold told 
him, after searching through sev- 
eral reference books. “Queels 
haven’t any throat muscles. They 
rely on gravity to get food down. 
But in free-fall, there isn’t any 
gravity, so they can’t get the 
food down.” 

It was simple, Gregor knew, 
one of those little things you 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




would never consider on Earth. 
But space, with its artificial en- 
vironment, aggravated even the 
simplest problems. 

“You’ll have to spin ship to 
give them some gravity,” Arnold 
said. 

Gregor did some quick mental 
multiplication. “That’ll use up 
a lot of power.” 

“Then the book says you can 
push the food down their throats 
by hand. You roll it up in a 
moist ball and reach in as far as 
the elbow and — ” 

Gregor signed off and activated 
the side jets. His feet settled to 
the floor and he waited anxiously. 

The Queels began to feed with 
an abandon that would have done 
a Queel-farmer’s heart good. 

He would have to refuel at 
the Vermoine II space warehouse 
and that would bring up their 
operating expenses, for fuel was 
expensive in newly colonized sys- 
tems. Still, there would be a good 
margin of profit left over. 

He returned to normal ship’s 
duties. The spaceship crawled 
through the immensity of space. 

Feeding time came again. Gre- 
gor fed the Queels and went on 
to the Smag compartment. He 
opened the door and called out, 
“Come and get it!” 

Nothing came. 

The compartment was empty. 

Gregor felt a curious sensation 
in his stomach. It was impossible. 



The Smags couldn’t be gone. 
They were playing a joke on 
him, hiding somewhere. 

But there was no place in the 
compartment for five large Smags 
to hide. 

The trembling sensation was 
turning into a full-grown quiver. 
Gregor remembered the forfeiture 
clauses in event of loss, damage, 
etcetera, etcetera. 

“Here, Smag! Here, SmagF’ he 
shouted. There was no answer. 

He inspected the walls, ceiling, 
door and ventilators, on the 
chance that the Smags had some- 
how bored through. 

There were no marks. 

Then he heard a faint noise 
near his feet. Looking down, he 
saw something scuttle past him. 

It was one of his Smags, 
shrunken to about two inches in 
length. He found the others hid- 
ing in a corner, all just as small. 

What had the Trigale official 
said? “When you travel with 
Smags, don’t forget your magni- 
fying glass.” 

T HERE was no time for a 
good, satisfying shock reac- 
tion. Gregor closed the door care- 
fully and sprinted to the radio. 

“ Very odd,” Arnold said, after 
radio contact had been made. 
“Shrunken, you say? I’m looking 
it up right now. Hmm ... You 
didn’t produce artificial gravity, 
did you?” 



126

“Of course. To let the Queels 
feed.” 

“Shouldn’t have done that,” 
Arnold said. “Queels are light- 
gravity creatures.” 

“How was I supposed to 
know?” 

“When they’re subjected to an 
unusual — for them — gravity, 
they shrink down to microscopic 
size, lose consciousness and die.” 
“But you told me to produce 
artificial gravity.” 

“Oh, no! I simply mentioned, 
in passing, that that was one way 
of making Queels feed. I suggest- 
ed hand-feeding.” 

Gregor resisted an almost over- 
powering urge to rip the radio 
out of the wall. He said, “Ar- 
nold, the Smags are light-gravity 
animals. Right?” 

“Right.” 

“And the Queels are heavy 
gravity. Did you know that when 
you signed the contract?” 

Arnold gulped for a moment, 
then cleared his throat. “Well, 
that did seem to make it a bit 
more difficult. But it pays very 
well.” 

“Sure, if you can get away 
with it. What do I do now?” 
“Lower the temperature,” Ar- 
nold replied confidently. “Smags 
stabilize at the freezing point.” 
“Humans freeze at the freezing 
point,” Gregor said. “All right, 
signing off.” 

Gregor put on all the extra 



clothes he could find and turned 
up the ship’s refrigeration sys- 
tem. Within an hour, the Smags 
had returned to their normal size. 

So far, so good. He checked the 
Queels. The cold seemed to 
stimulate them. They were live- 
lier than ever and bleated for 
more food. He fed them. 

After eating a ham-and-wool 
sandwich, Gregor turned in. 

The next day’s inspection re- 
vealed that there were now fif- 
teen Queels on board. The ten 
original adults had given birth 
to five young. All were hungry. 

Gregor fed them. He set it 
down as a normal hazard of 
transporting mixed groups of 
livestock. They should have an- 
ticipated this and segregated the 
beasts by sexes as well as spe- 
cies. 

When he looked in on the 
Queels again, their number had 
increased to thirty-eight. 

“OEPRODUCED, did they?” 
Arnold asked via radio, his 
voice concerned. 

_ “Yes. And they show no signs 
of stopping.” 

“Well, we should have expect- 
ed it.” 

“Why?” Gregor demanded baf- 
fledly. 

“I told you. Queels reproduce 
feemishly.” 

“I thought that’s what you 
said. What does it mean?” 



MILK RUN

“Just what it sounds like,” said 
Arnold, irritated. “How did you 
ever get through school? It’s 
freezing-point parthenogenesis.” 

“That does it,” Gregor said 
grimly. “I’m turning this ship 
around.” 

“You can’t! We’ll be wiped 
out!” 

“At the rate those Queels are 
reproducing, there won’t be room 
for me if I keep going. A Queel 
will have to pilot this ship.” 

“Gregor, don’t get panicky. 
There’s a perfectly simple an- 
swer.” 

“I’m listening.” 

“Increase the air pressure and 
moisture content. That’ll stop 
them.” 

“Sure. And it’ll probably turn 
the Smags into butterflies.” 

“There, won’t be any other ef- 
fects.” 

Turning back was no solution, 
anyhow. The ship was near the 
halfway mark. Now he could get 
rid of the beasts just as quickly 
by delivering them. 

Unless he dumped them all into 
space. It was a tempting though 
impractical thought. 

With increased air pressure and 
moisture content, the Queels 
stopped reproducing. They num- 
bered forty-seven now and Gre- 
gor had to spend most of his time 
clearing the ventilators of wool. 
A slow-motion, surrealistic snow- 
storm raged in the corridors and 



engine room, in the water tanks 
and under his shirt. 

Gregor ate tasteless meals of 
food and wool, with pie and wool 
for dessert. 

He was beginning to feel like 
a Queel. 

But then a bright spot ap- 
proached on his horizon. The 
Vermoine sun began glowing on 
his forward screen. In another 
day, he would arrive, deliver his 
cargo and be free to go home to 
his dusty office, his bills and his 
solitaire game. 

That night, he opened a bottle 
of wine to celebrate the end of 
the trip. It helped get the taste of 
wool out of his mouth and he 
fell into bed, mildly and pleas- 
antly tipsy. 

But he couldn’t sleep. The 
temperature was still dropping. 
Beads of moisture, on the walls of 
the ship were solidifying into ice. 

He had to have heat. 

Let’s see — if he turned on 
the heaters, the Smags would 
shrink. Unless he stopped the 
gravity. In which case, the forty- 
seven Queels wouldn’t eat. 

To hell with the Queels. He was 
getting too cold to operate the 
ship. 

H E brought the vessel out of 
its spin and turned on the 
heaters. For an hour, he wait- 
ed, shivering and stamping his 
feet. The heaters merrily drained 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fuel from the engines, but pro- 
duced no heat. 

That was ridiculous. He turn- 
ed them on full blast. 

In another hour, the tem- 
perature had sunk below zero. 
Although Vermoine was now vis- 
ible, Gregor didn’t know if he 
could even control the ship for a 
landing. 

He had just finishing building 
a small fire on the cabin floor, us- 
ing the ship’s more combustible 
furnishings as fuel, when the radio 
spluttered into life, 

“I was just thinking,” Arnold 
said. “I hope you haven’t been 
changing gravity and pressure 
too abruptly.” 

“What difference does it 
make?” Gregor asked distracted- 
ly- 

“You might unstabilize the 
Firgels. Rapid temperature and 
pressure changes could take them 
out of their dormant state. You’d 
better check.” 

Gregor hurried off. He opened 
the door to the Firgel compart- 
ment, peered in and shuddered. 

The Firgels were awake and 
croaking. The big lizards were 
floating around their compart- 
ment, covered with frost. A blast 
of sub-zero air roared into the 
passageway. Gregor slammed the 
door and hurried back to the 
radio. 

“Of course they’re covered 
with frost,” Arnold said. “Those 



Firgels are going to Vermoine I. 
Hot place, Vermoine I — right near 
the sun. The Firgels are cold-fix- 
ers — best portable air-condi- 
tioners in the Universe.” 

“Why didn’t you tell me this 
sooner?” Gregor demanded. 

“It would have upset you. Be- 
sides, they would have stayed 
dormant if you hadn’t started 
fooling with gravity and pres- 
sure.” 

“The Firgels are going to Ver- 
moine I. What about the Smags?” 
“Vermoine II. Tiny planet, not 
much gravity.” 

“And the Queels?” 

“Vermoine III, of course.” 
“You idiot!” Gregor shouted. 
“You give me a cargo like that 
and expect me to balance it?” If 
Arnold had been in the ship at 
that moment, Gregor would have 
strangled him. “Arnold,” he said, 
very slowly, “no more schemes, 
no more ideas — promise?” 

“Oh, all right,” Arnold agreed. 
“No need to get peevish about it.” 
Gregor signed off and went to 
work, trying to warm the ship. 
He succeeded in boosting it to 
twenty-seven degrees Fahrenheit 
before the overworked heaters 
gave up. 

By then, Vermoine II was dead 
ahead. 

G REGOR knocked on a piece 
of wood he hadn’t burned 
and set the tape. He was punch- 



ing a course for the Main Ware- 
house, in orbit around Vermoine 
II, when he heard an ominous 
grumbling noise. At the same 
time, half a dozen dials on the 
control panel flopped over to 
zero. 

Wearily, he floated back to the 
engine room. His main drive was 
dead and it didn’t take any spe- 
cial mechanical aptitude to fig- 
ure out why. 

Queel wool floated in the engine 
room’s still air. Queel wool was 
in the bearings and in the lubri- 
cating system, clogging the cool- 
ing fans. 

The metallic wool made an 
ideal abrasive for highly polish- 
ed engine parts. It was a wonder 
the drive had held up this long. 

He returned to the control 
room. He couldn’t land the ship 
without the main drive. Repairs 
would have to be made in space, 
eating into their profits. Fortun- 
ately, the ship steered by rocket 
side jets. With no mechanical 
system to break down, he could 
still maneuver. 

It would be close, but he could 
still make contact with the arti- 
ficial satellite that served as the 
Vermoine warehouse. 

“This is AAA Ace,” he an- 
nounced as he squeezed the ship 
into an orbit around the satellite. 
“Request permission to land.” 

There was a crackle of static. 
“Satellite speaking,” a voice 



answered. “Identify yourself, 
please.” 

“This is the AAA Ace ship, 
bound to Vermoine II from Tri- 
gale Central Warehouse,” Gre- 
gor elaborated. “My papers are 
in order.” He repeated the rou- 
tine request for landing privilege 
and leaned back in his chair. 

It had been a struggle, but all 
his animals were alive, intact, 
healthy, happy, etcetera, etcetera. 
AAA Ace had made a nice little 
profit. But all he wanted now was 
to get out of this ship and into 
a hot bath. He wanted to spend 
the rest of his life as far from 
Queels, Smags and Firgels as 
possible. He wanted . 

“Landing permission refused.” 

“What?” 

“Sorry, but we’re full up at 
present. If you want to hold your 
present orbit, I believe we can 
accommodate you in about three 
months.” 

“Hold on!” Gregor yelped. 
“You can’t do this! I’m almost 
out of food, my main drive is 
shot and I can’t stand these ani- 
mals much longer!” 

“Sorry.” 

“You can’t turn me away,” 
Gregor said hoarsely. “This is a 
public warehouse. You have 
to—” 

“Public? I beg your pardon, sir. 
This warehouse is owned and 
operated by the Trigale Com- 
bine.” 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



T HE radio went dead. Gregor 
stared at it for several min- 
utes. 

Trigale! 

Of course they hadn’t bothered 
him at their Central Warehouse. 
They had him by simply refus- 
ing landing privileges at their 
Vermoine warehouse. 

And the hell of it was, they 
were probably within their rights. 

He couldn’t land on the planet. 
Bringing the ship down without 
a main drive would be suicide. 
And there was no other space 
warehouse in the Vermoine solar 
system. 

Well, he had brought the ani- 
mals almost to the warehouse. 
Certainly Mr. Vens would un- 
derstand the circumstances and 
judge his intentions. 

He contacted Vens on Ver- 
moine II and explained the situa- 
tion. 

“Not at the warehouse?” Vens 
asked. 

“Well, within fifty miles of the 
warehouse,” Gregor said. 

“That really won’t do. I’ll take 
the animals, of course. They’re 
mine. But there are forfeiture 
clauses in the event of incom- 
plete delivery.” 

“You wouldn’t invoke them, 
would you?” Gregor pleaded. 
“My intentions — ” 

“They don’t interest me,” 
Vens said. “Margin of profit and 
all that. We colonists need every 



little bit.” He signed off. 

Perspiring in the cold room, 
Gregor called Arnold and told 
him the news. 

“It’s unethical!” Arnold de- 
clared in outrage. 

“But legal.” 

“I know, damn it. I have to 
have time to think.” 

“You’d better find something 
good,” Gregor said. 

“I’ll call you back.” 

Gregor spent the next few 
hours feeding his animals, pick- 
ing Queel wool out of his hair 
and burning more furniture on 
the deck of the ship. When the 
radio buzzed, he crossed his fing- 
ers before answering it 
“Arnold?” 

“No, this is Vens.” 

“Listen, Mr. Vens,” Gregor 
said, “if you’d just give us a 
little more time, we could work 
out this thing amicably. I’m 
sure — ” 

“Oh, you’ve got me over a bar- 
rel, all right,” Vens snapped. 
“It’s perfectly legal, too. I check- 
ed. Shrewd operation, sir, very 
shrewd operation. I’m sending a 
tug for the animals.” 

“But the forfeiture clause — ” 
“Naturally, I cannot invoke 
it.” Vens signed off. 

G REGOR stared at the radio. 

Shrewd operation? What had 
Arnold done? 

He called Arnold’s office. 



MILK RUN

“This is Mr. Arnold’s secre- 
tary,” a young feminine voice an- 
swered. “Mr. Arnold has left for 
the day.” 

“Left? Secretary? Is this the 
Arnold of AAA Ace? I’ve got 
the wrong Arnold, haven’t I?” 
“No, sir, this is Mr. Arnold’s 
office, of the AAA Ace Planetary 
Warehouse Service. Did you wish 
to place an order? We have a 
first-class warehouse in the Ver- 
moine system, in an orbit near 
Vermoine II. We handle light, 
medium and heavy gravity prod- 
ucts. Personal supervision by our 
Mr. Gregor. And I think you’ll 
find that our rates are quite at- 
tractive.” 

S O that was what Arnold had 
done — he had turned their 
ship into a warehouse! On paper, 
at least. And their contract did 
give them the option of supplying 
their own warehouse. Clever! 

But that nuisance Arnold 
could never leave well enough 
alone. Now he wanted to go into 
the warehouse business! 

“What did you say, sir?” 

“I said this is the warehouse 
speaking. I want to leave a mes- 
sage for Mr. Arnold.” 

“Yes, sir?” * 

“Tell Mr. Arnold to cancel all 
orders,” Gregor said grimly. “His 
warehouse is coming home as fast 
as it can hobble.”

who huddled together in one of 
the craters, a hundred yards 
from the mile-wide edifice. 

Art Grant raised his head 
cautiously over the lip of the 
depression. Almost directly 
ahead, a hundred-foot-high 
mound of earth lay against the 
sloping side of the dome, thrown 
up there, no doubt, by an earlier 
generation’s nuclear missile. 

“What are we waiting for, Cap- 
tain?” a husky voice whispered 
almost in his ear. 

It was Stausman, the Oxford- 
educated German. 

Art slid back down the con- 
cavity of the crater. “We’ll be 
ready to go in another ten or fif- 
teen minutes, I guess.” 

“Fifteen minute, hell!” It was 
the Russian, Karneiv. “Go now, I 
say! Go and be finish with job 
more quickly!” 

“Is it not mon capitaine who 
commands this squad?” Philip 
Latour, Parisian, demanded chid- 
ingly. 

Thunder boomed, closer this 
time. 

“If we wait until the height of 
the storm,” Art explained pa- 
tiently, “there’s a chance that*he 
more delicate detection devices 
.will be affected by electrical dis- 
charge.” 

“Voila!” exclaimed the French- 
man. “Now you have the reason, 
have you not?” 

But Karneiv Wasn’t satisfied. 



“And the storm? What if it not 
come this way?” 

Art moved his shoulders. 
“Then we’ll go back and sit it 
out until the next one. It’s better 
to wait a few days than to waste 
five years of training.” 

T IGHTNING flashed to their 
" right — closer this time. Art 
counted seconds until the thun- 
der came. The storm, he calcu- 
lated, should sweep over them in 
less than five minutes. 

The silence that followed was 
broken only by the rhythmic 
clack-clack of the radiation coun- 
ters strapped on their wrists. 

Art read the luminous dial on 
his instrument — twenty Roent- 
gen rays an hour. He went over 
to the two ponderous metal cases 
that lay in the crater with them — 
had been with them for over an 
hour. The glowing needle swung 
up to twenty-five Rs. 

“Gamma leakage the same?” 
asked Stausman. 

“No change.” 

“Then we’ve had about a twen- 
ty-R dose so far.” 

“More or less,” Art acknow- 
ledged. “We still have five hours 
left to get rid of this stuff with- 
out being in any danger.” 

The Frenchman rose and 
stretched his thin frame. “And, 
mes amis,” he asked, “it is all de- 
cided that I, Latour, will be the 
one who will — how do you say? —

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mix the ingredients to make the 
critical mass?” 

“Like hell!” Karneiv lunged 
up. “It was a Russian who was 
first human to set off nuclear de- 
vice by hand — in Great Palace 
of Kremlin. Will be Russian this 
time!” 

Stausman’s mastery of English 
broke under the impact of in- 
tense resentment. “Nein! Will be 
me!” he shouted, thumping his 
chest. Then in a calmer though 
still determined voice, he said, 
“I volunteered with the under- 
standing I would set off the de- 
vice!” 

Latour’s angry face was illu- 
minated by another flash of light- 
ning as he stood before the Ger- 
man, his bony fists knotted. 
“Latour will be the one! I, La- 
tour, will—” 

“Shut up!” Art’s voice rasped. 
“We can decide that later.” 

But he knew there would be no 
decision. He was in command. 
And he would simply order them 
to return after they had helped 
bring the components of the de- 
vice to the most vulnerable spot 
in the dome. 

Sulking, the other three drop- 
ped back to the ground. 

Then it started to rain — a 
vicious, pelting downpour that 
soaked them to the skin within 
seconds and sent rivulets stream- 
ing down their faces and cascad- 
ing from their chins and elbows 



and from the tips of their weapon 
holsters. 

Art grasped a handle of one 
of the metal boxes. “Let’s go!” 

Latour took the other handle 
and, under the great weight of 
the container, they struggled over 
the lip of the crater. Stausman 
and Karneiv followed with the 
other case. 

In the driving rain, they plod- 
ded toward the dome, bending 
outward against the pull of their 
burdens. 

“The Shrine of Satan!” Latour 
grunted, using both hands to sup- 
port his half of the load. “Ten 
million tons of concrete and steel 
for one man. Truly he is le 
diableP’ 

^ITHE mound of earth against 
the dome could riot have been 
better located for their purpose 
had they supervised its construc- 
tion. 

Its top, where they now stood 
in the relentless rain, was only 
a few feet below the huge barrel 
of one of the thousands of missile 
ejectors that ringed the squat 
structure like a halo of spikes. 

Art had thrown a rope over the 
barrel and the others had shinned 
up to a perch on top of the metal 
cylinder. Now he tied the rope 
to a second ponderous container 
and watched as they hoisted it 
up. Then, hand over hand, he 
climbed to join them. 



SATAN'S SHRINE 



137 



“Sacrebleu!” the Frenchman 
exclaimed. “Will not the weather 
himself stir /e diable in his Shrine 
this night?” 

Art laughed, throwing a leg 
over the end of the barrel. “Afraid 
not, Latour — not through a shell 
a thousand feet thick. But we’ll 
see what we can do.” 

He dropped onto the slanting 
inner surface of the rifle and 
caught Latour’s hand, as the 
Frenchman leaped down beside 
him. The two then struggled to 
lower the heavy boxes as Staus- 
man and Karneiv handed them 
down. 

Assembled in the barrel, they 
moved cautiously down the slope. 

The dome trembled. Then an- 
other vicious flash and roar erup- 
ted less than a mile from the edi- 
fice, lighting even the inside of 
the missile ejector with intense 
purplish illumination. 

Stausman shouted, “That was 
no bolt, Captain! Satan fired an 
interceptor missile! It exploded 
the incoming missile right out- 
side!” 

Art checked his watch. 
“They’ve jumped the gun! This 
can play hell with our plan!” 

Latour sneered. “A fine . ex- 
ample of Prussian coordination, 
is it not?” 

“The instructions,” Stausman 
snapped back, “were relayed 
through the French underground 
— don’t forget!” 



Art lifted his burden again 
and started forward in a lumber- 
ing run, pulling the Frenchman 
along with him. “Let’s get out 
of here before Satan starts firing 
salvos back.” 

Discarding caution, they raced 
down the incline. 

"Mon Dieu!” the Frenchman 
panted. “This rifle, is it not in the 
German attack sector?” 

“Right in the center of it,” 
Stausman replied. “Main Euro- 
pean battery. It’ll be one of the 
first to fire back. Right, Cap- 
tain?” 

A RT didn’t answer. He was 
staring ahead — at a faint 
glow th^t picked up a thousand 
reflections along the rifling of 
the barrel. 

“A light!” Karneiv exclaimed. 
“But why? He need no light in 
outer defense! Loading, firing — 
all is automatic, no?” 

“Of course,” Stausman ack- 
nowledged, disturbed. “Even the 
assembly of the missiles.” 

They reached the end of the 
rifle and climbed out through a 
four-foot-wide slit along one side, 
squeezing past a metallic con- 
veyor belt that bore a motionless 
string -of sleek-nosed projectiles. 

Leaping onto the concrete land- 
ing, Art and Latour reached up to 
take the metal containers and to 
help the other two men. 

Almost as soon as they cleared 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the area of the belt, gears whir- 
red and the line of projectiles 
inched forward, depositing the 
first missile into the barrel. 

“It’ll fire in seconds!” Art 
warned frantically. “The back- 
lash of gases!” 

Again, they paired off and 
struggled with the containers, 
stumbling down a wide corridor 
that paralleled the perimeter of 
the dome. 

The concrete all around them 
shook and a wave of concussion 
pounded their eardrums. 

“Already he fire back!” Kar- 
neiv shouted. 

■JVTOXIOUS gases caught up 
-L ’ with them and they coughed 
spasmodically, slowing their pace. 

The breech of the barrel 
through which they had entered 
now lay hidden around the curve 
of the corridor behind them. But 
visible ahead was the projectile 
belt and protruding breech of the 
next weapon. As they approach- 
ed, the unit loaded a missile. 

Another blast from their rear 
shook the monstrous structure 
and more hot gases swirled in 
the passageway. 

Art stumbled and lost his grip 
on the metal case. It crashed 
against his leg, tearing cloth and 
scraping a strip of skin from his 
calf. 

Stausman helped him up. 

“Voila!” Latour shouted. 



“There it is! The passage that 
goes inward!” He was pointing 
to a darker corridor that branch- 
ed off to their left. They raced 
into it as the rifle immediately 
behind them fired. 

Art stopped to inspect the 
bleeding wound in his leg. 

Karneiv stopped to look, too. 
“Is unserious,” he said. 

“Perhaps. But I’d better wrap 
it up temporarily so we can go 
on.” Art tore a strip from the 
ripped trouser leg and bound it 
around the wound. 

“The Yankees — they not able 
to stand a little pain, eh?” Kar- 
neiv said sarcastically. “They 
prove that on Asiatic mainland; 
in Ukraine during Third War. 
Comrade Captain Starnoff — he 
should be leader to this expedi- 
tion,” he muttered. “He would 
have — ” 

“Quiet!” Stausman cautioned. 
“Satan may be listening.” 

“ Quite right, gentlemen.” 

The voice seemed to erupt from 
the very walls. 

“This is — let us see — Expedi- 
tion Number Ninety-three. The 
first one in over ten years . 
Welcome, gentlemen! Let us sin- 
cerely hope that we shall derive 
equal enjoyment from your brief 
visit.” 

“Le diable!” Latour looked 
fearfully down the corridor. 

“He’s detected us already!” 
Stausman said hopelessly. 



SATAN'S SHRINE

Machinery grumbled and a 
concrete partition slid into place, 
closing off the radial corridor at 
the point where they had entered 
it. 

“Didn’t you imagine you’d find 
even more thorough safeguards 
within the Shrine than without? 
You should have surmised as 
much, knowing that not a single 
member of the previous ninety- 
two expeditions returned to the 
outside.” 

Art glanced over his head. He 
could see speakers, spaced at in- 
tervals along the ceiling, together 
with lights, audio pickups and 
shining lenses that were, no 
doubt, part of a video detection 
system. 

“Again I say welcome, gentle- 
men — a cordial welcome from the 
Supreme Autocrat of The Asso- 
ciated Nations . from, as you 
refer to me, Satan. May you en- 
joy your brief expedition.” 

Art turned despairingly to the 
others. “I didn’t think detection 
would come so soon. We now 
have little hope of gaining our 
objective. Whoever wishes to re- 
turn has my permission to do so.” 

“And you, mon ami?” 

“You know my answer, Latour. 
Thirty years ago my father led 
Expedition Number Eighty- 
five.” 

Latour patted him sympatheti- 
cally on the shoulder. “Then, to- 
gether, mon capitaine, we will 



extract la vengeance from le 
diable.” 

Art turned to Karneiv. “And 
you?” 

“If the Frenchman go, and the 
Yankee go, then without question 
the Russian go, too!” he said ar- 
rogantly. 

“Stausman?” 

The German laughed. “In the 
absence of pneumatic drills to 
break through that thing — ” he 
motioned toward the concrete 
panel which barred their retreat 
— “you’ll have to count me in, 
too, Captain.” 

T HE radial corridor ended at 
an intersection with a peri- 
pheral passageway. As they ap- 
proached, a concrete panel slid 
shut to block the left-hand 
branch of the new tunnel. 

After they had hauled the 
metal containers almost a block 
past the intersection, they paused 
to rest again as Art adjusted the 
bandage on his leg. 

Karneiv grumbled angrily. “We 
get nowhere if Yankee stop to 
rub leg all time.” 

His face set grimly, Art stared 
at the big Russian. “In training,” 
he reminded sharply, “we decided 
on four rest periods an hour.” 
The Russian stepped closer. 
“But we not know then we would 
be detected so — ” 

A cry from the Frenchman 
drew their stares. He was point- 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing to the floor a few yards down 
the corridor. 

Almost indiscernible against 
the gray concrete was a human 
skeleton. Ahead was another, then 
farther on, they found three more. 

“ Mon dieu!" Latour exclaim- 
ed. “The dead ones — they are all 
along here!” 

Stausman laughed briefly. 
“Frenchmen, no doubt.” 

Latour squinted at him. “You 
will please explain how you de- 
duce that.” 

“They’re the easiest to kill.” 
The German’s voice was devoid 
of jocularity. “If there are any 
dead Germans, you’ll find them 
closer to the center of the Shrine.” 

Latour swore in French and 
lunged for the larger man. 

Art stepped between them. 
“Save it till later,” he ordered. 

Tensely, Stausman and Latour 
started back for the crates, Art 
and the Russian following. 

“This no shell.” Karneiv swung 
an arm in the air around him. 
“All one solid hunk concrete with 
tunnels. Small wonder no attack 
had success.” 

Stausman stopped to wait for 
Art. “Our principal mistake, I 
think, Captain, has been in not 
establishing a system of getting 
information back to World Un- 
derground headquarters, where it 
could benefit future expeditions.” 

“I wonder,” Art answered 
thoughtfully, “whether the other 



ninety-two expeditions had the 
same idea just about here.” 
Stausman shrugged indifferent- 
ly. “You may be right.” 

The Frenchman paused before 
reaching down for his handle of 
the case. “How long, gentlemen — 
how many expeditions before le 
diable is dethroned?” 

Art hoisted his end of the con- 
tainer. “Let’s hope this is the 
last.” 

T ATOUR shook his head for- 
-^lornly. “I cannot be that op- 
timistic, monsieur le capitaine. It 
has been three hundred years 
now. Ever since — ” 

“Ever since,” Stausman broke 
in, “the French allowed Jornal 
Sakoran, the Immortal, to es- 
tablish the nucleus of his Shrine 
on the Continent.” 

“I do not believe he is im- 
mortal,” Karneiv— interjected. 
“We go about this wrong!” the 
Russian continued. “What we 
do? We make secret appropri- 
ations — every year, from every 
national area in Associated Na- 
tions. We equip expeditionary 
force with different nationalities, 
so that will be no chance for any 
one nation to control Shrine and 
take up where Satan leave off — ” 
“We trust each other, don’t 
we?” Stausman asked sarcastic- 
ally. 

“But is all wrong,” Karneiv 
went on. “Last year alone, East 



SATAN'S SHRINE 



141 



Asians spent almost billion — 
Yankee area almost six hundred 
million — all for attack Shrine. In 
past ten year, we put almost 
thousand men in Secret Corps 
all over whole world. What it 
get us?” 

“Shut up!” Art roared. Then 
in a whisper, “Don’t you realize 
he can hear everything in here?” 
“What the hell!” the Russian 
answered explosively. “He know 
already. He got spies all over. 
That’s all he use money from 
national areas for — to keep up 
spy system, pay off agents.” 
They filed around several 
skeletons that were lying in the 
center of the corridor. 

“I say we should attack spy 
system!” Karneiv was arguing. 
“Then Satan not know on which 
national area to make retalia- 
tion.” 

Art shook his head. “Tried that 
once. He just sat back and lob- 
bed missiles into all the areas 
until his underground communi- 
cation lines were restored. Killed 
several hundred persons all over 
the world that time.” 

Latour sneered. “Three thou- 
sand and I still would have re- 
sisted! Three hundred thousand 
died in the first hour of the Third 
War, is it not so?” 

“Could have been three mil- 
lion,” Art reminded him. “De- 
stroying hundreds was just a — 
threat.” 



“/ see you have arrived at the 
first check point.” 

A RT started, almost dropping 
his end of the case, as the 
voice boomed from the ceiling 
and reverberated up and down 
the corridor from a score of 
speakers. 

“We shall have roll-call after- 
ward.” 

The speakers went dead and 
silence seized the corridor once 
more. 

“Radioactivity up !” Latour 
shouted, bringing his wrist count - 
ter before his face. 

Art was suddenly conscious 
of the vicious chattering of his 
detector. He jerked his head to- 
ward the metal case he had 
dropped, to see whether its lid 
had somehow been jarred loose. 
But it was intact, as was the 
other. 

Now the counter was reacting 
so violently that it was setting up 
vibrations in his wrist. 

“One hundred Rs!” the French- 
man gasped. He was holding his 
hand close to the wall. “She 
comes from both sides! From the 
ceiling too!” 

Karneiv and Art sprinted down 
the corridor. 

“One hundred and fifty!” La- 
tour yelled as he and Stausman 
followed. 

But the German glanced over 
his shoulder. “The device!” He 



142 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was looking back at the two me- 
tal containers they had aban- 
doned. 

“Hell with them!” Art instruc- 
ted. “We have only seconds to 
get out of this hot spot!” 

Already the needle of his 
counter was halfway through the 
red mark on its dial. 

A deep-throated laugh filled 
the passageway. “Run faster, 
gentlemen," the voice urged 
through the speakers. “You do 
not have much farther to go." 

Art glanced behind him as he 
ran . and jolted to a stop. 

Stausman had gone back and 
was struggling with the metal 
cases ! 

“Let them go!” he shouted 
angrily at the German. 

“But we have to have them!” 
Stausman pleaded. 

Hesitating, Art backed in the 
direction that Karneiv and La- 
tour had gone. “We can’t do a 
damned thing if we get shot up 
with radiation!” 

Then he turned and raced after 
the other two. 

Apparently convinced, Staus- 
man followed, running at break- 
neck speed. But he faltered and 
fell, losing more critical seconds. 

A ROUND the turn in the cor- 
ridor, Art found the French- 
man and the Russian, leaning 
against the wall. 

“Clear here,” Latour panted. 



He drew up beside them, wait- 
ing for Stausman. 

Karneiv was staring at his 
watch as the German reached 
them. 

A concrete panel slid in place 
twenty feet to their rear. 

Art fought his irregular breath- 
ing. “You keep a time check?” 
he asked Karneiv. 

The Russian nodded. “I calcu- 
late Latour got single dose of 
about one-hundred-twenty R. Me 
too.” 

“Might vomit once or twice in 
a few hours,” Art said thought- 
fully. 

“You, Captain, got almost two 
hundred.” 

Art frowned. “What about 
Stausman?” he asked. 

Karneiv stared hesitatingly at 
the Captain who, in turn, glanced 
fearfully at Stausman. 

“I kept check too,” the Ger- 
man said unemotionally. “I 
got — ” 

The ceiling speakers rumbled. 
“Over one thousand /” the voice 
said. “A fatal dose — not immedi- 
ately fatal perhaps. There will 
first be vomiting and thirst and 
fever and delirium — in a short 
while. Then you will die.” 

Stausman clenched a fist and 
raised it toward the nearest video 
lens in the ceiling. “But not be- 
fore I find you, you — devil!” he 
threatened. “Not before — ” 

“Easy,” Art calmed him, hold- 



SATAN'S SHRINE 



143 



ing his arms at his side. “Exer- 
tion’ll only make it worse.” 

“I don’t give a damn!” the 
German exclaimed, his teeth set 
tightly together. “I’m not afraid 
of failure. I should have died in 
training three years ago — when 
they had to cover that hole in my 
skull with a plate!” 

He broke loose from Art and 
bolted to race up the corridor. 
But Latour and Karneiv caught 
him, each by an arm. 

“Let me go!” he screamed. “I’ll 
find him! I’ll — ” 

"Patience, mon ami,” the 
Frenchman whispered. It was the 
first time he had used the phrase 
addressing the German. 

“You do no good by self.” Kar- 
neiv shook his head dourly. “Per- 
haps together we find devil of 
Shrine before — ” 

Stausman relaxed in their grip. 
They released him cautiously. 

“Feeling better?” Art asked, 
embarrassed after he had said it. 

The German nodded, smiled 
weakly. 

After a moment, Karneiv inton- 
ed softly, “Death to Satan!” 

He was staring at the wall — 
at a spot above the outstretched 
arm of a skeleton. The bony fin- 
gers still clutched the rock that 
the victim had used to scratch 
Expedition 47 in the chalky con- 
crete. 

Farther along, another scrawl, 
Death to Dictator Sakoran! 



The phrase typed him as a mem- 
ber of one of the earliest expedi- 
tions — dating -to the time before 
Sakoran had earned the more 
pointed alphabetical designation 
Satan from the initials of his as- 
sumed title, “Supreme Autocrat 
of The Associated Nations.” 

“rpHE Sun, he is just rising out- 
A side now, n’est pas?” Latour 
asked wistfully. 

It was almost two hours after 
they had run the gantlet of the 
radioactive corridor. They were 
tired and haggard and had drawn 
up to allow Stausman to rest. 

Art checked his watch and 
nodded. 

“Then in three hours the — 
how you say? fireworks — they 
will commence, non?” 

Art closed his eyes and passed 
a hand over his face. He was 
just beginning to experience the 
nauseating effects of exposure to 
gamma radiation. He swallowed 
with difficulty. “The general mis- 
sile attack will begin in three 
hours and fifteen minutes,” he 
acknowledged. 

“Fools!” Karneiv roared in 
front of him. “The microphones! 
He listen!” 

“He knows. The probing at- 
tack has been routine after al- 
most every expedition. He will 
expect the missiles as a test of 
our success.” 

“Bah!” the Russian spat. “Suc- 



144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cess. We will fail! Satan play 
games with us!” 

A grating sounded behind them 
and they whirled abound, in- 
stinctively drawing their weapons. 
But it was only another partition, 
sliding into place to bar the pas- 
sageway. • 

Stausman, who had just pass- 
ed the spot, was leaning against 
the wall, sick. Latour uttered a 
sympathetic phrase in French 
and went back to grasp the Ger- 
man’s shoulder and support him. 

Karneiv turned to Art. “How 
much more we got to go? What 
you think?” 

Art looked down at the floor, 
hopelessly. “We haven’t gone' a 
fifth of the way to the center,” he 
said in a voice that was intention- 
ally low, so Stausman wouldn’t 
hear. 

“Look, Captain,” the Russian 
said abruptly. “We come along 
curving corridors. We find doors 
of stone blocking our way so we 
must go only 'where he wants. 
Why we no break one of those 
doors when he make us go in 
circle again? Might be we find 
way straight in.” 

Art considered the suggestion. 
But before he could express his 
approval, he gagged suddenly and 
turned quickly away from Kar- 
neiv. 

After he had finished, Art felt 
somewhat weak and his throat 
was dry and musty. He cursed 



himself for not having insisted 
that they bring along water. 

OTAUSMAN joined them and 
^ they all continued down the 
passageway. The German’s face 
was pale and drawn and he walk- 
ed unsteadily. 

Art fell back and helped sup- 
port the German. Karneiv walk- 
ed cautiously ahead, mumbling 
angrily in Russian as they passed 
more skeletons. 

" Pourquoi ?” the Frenchman 
asked thoughtfully, looking down 
at the victims of another expedi- 
tion. 

When no one answered, he re- 
peated, “Why? Why does not 
le diable stop us where we are? 
Why does he not kill us now?” 

The others were silent, except 
Stausman, who showed no re- 
action. 

Latour stopped and the rest 
of the party stopped with him. 

“Le diable — could he not have 
closed us up in the radiation 
field? Or could he not have con- 
fined us in any section of the 
passage to let the hunger consume 
us, as it no doubt consumed these 
poor unfortunates here?” 

Karneiv frowned deeply. “Is 
so. Why he no do it?” 

“Diversion, gentlemen,” the 
amplified voice erupted in the 
speakers. “It is not often that I 
am privileged to observe my sub- 
jects at such close quarters. 



SATAN'S SHRINE 



145 



Therefore, I am not disposed to 
cut my amusement short.” 

Stausman shouted frenziedly 
and tore loose from Art and La- 
tour. He reeled down the corridor 
until he reached a spot under- 
neath the first suspended speaker. 

Then his revolver was in his 
hand and he was firing up at the 
vibrating diaphragm. The first 
two shots silenced the speaker 
and he stood swaying in the cen- 
ter of the passageway. 

Now the amplified voice was 
a series of secondary echoes that 
reached them from points farther 
along the tunnel. “Shoot at them 
Go ahead! You cannot hit me!”! 

Still dazed, the German turned 
on the other three men. His face 
was red — his eyes half closed — 
his body trembled. 

“Stausman!” Art shouted. The 
German was going to open fire 
on them! 

He raised the revolver. 

The Supreme Autocrat’s rever- 
berating laughter seemed to 
quicken his movement. 

The German fired an ineffec- 
tual shot with his wavering hand. 

Latour sprang, diving in under 
him and coming up beneath his 
outstretched arm. 

Then he seized the German’s 
wrist and wrested the gun from 
him before he could fire again. 

The German fainted. 

Art felt ill again. Nausea, ag- 
gravated by the emotional im- 

* 



pact of the incident, swept over 
him. 

“Goddam devil!” Karneiv roar- 
ed, shaking his fist at the video 
cell over his head. 

Then he snapped his gun from 
his holster and took careful aim. 
The weapon spat and the lens 
shattered. 

Latour, shouting a string of 
French expletives, raced to the 
next video pickup station and 
shot out its lens, too. 

“Wait!” Art ordered, straight- 
ening. “Save it. Maybe he wants 
us to get rid of our ammunition.” 

H OLLOW laughter came again 
from remote speakers. “Shall 
we proceed, gentlemen?” 

Art recovered from his seizure, 
went over to help Latour with 
Stausman. 

“The radiation,” the French- 
man observed, “I did not know 
it could do so much to a man in 
so little time.” 

“It shouldn’t,” Art agreed. 
“But that skull plate in his head 
may have something to do with 
it. There might be an absorption 
factor that — ” 

A concrete panel slid open 
swiftly on their left. 

“Check point, gentlemen,” the 
Supreme Autocrat announced. 

A second panel sprang out 
from the wall ahead of them. 
The new avenue which had been 
opened was not a corridor. Rath- 



146

er, it was a room, fifty feet wide 
and at least two hundred feet in 
length. The mouth of another 
tunnel was open at the other end. 
The floor was littered with the 
remains of past victims. 

“SacrebleuP' the Frenchman 
exclaimed. “Can we deny that 
here lies almost half the person- 
nel of all the other ninety-two 
expeditions?” 

Karneiv suddenly poked a 
thumb in the direction of Staus- 
man. “If we go, I say we leave 
him.” 

Art stared at the Russian. 

“He no good to us,” Karneiv 
explained emotionlessly. “He on- 
ly hold us back.” 

Art’s face was grim. “He goes 
— even if Latour and I have to 
carry him. Right, Latour?” 
“C’est correct!” 

Karneiv swore disgustedly. 
“Then Karneiv goes alone!” 
“You’ll stay with the expedi- 
tion!” 

The Russian shrugged un- 
easily. “I stay, but — ” 

“Are you all ready?” the Su- 
preme Autocrat broke in. 

Karneiv and Latour stared ap- 
prehensively into the room with 
the skeletons. 

“First,” the voice continued 
“let me take this opportunity to 
congratulate you while you are 
still there to hear. I find your 
method of entry into the Shrine 
quite novel. My commendations. 



SATAN'S SHRINE 



147 



I had been wondering when they 
would think of the ejectors. Un- 
til now, entry has usually been 
through the air ducts — or, occa- 
sionally, through the supply in- 
takes that were in use before the 
Shrine became self-sufficient by 
assembling a four-thousand-year 
stockpile of supplies.” 

The Supreme Autocrat’s voice 
was free of accent, Art realized 
for the first time. Was it that, in 
his centuries-old despotism over 
nearly all the nations of the 
world, he had severed all ties of 
nationalism — including his native 
French tongue? 

“Come, gentlemen.” The Auto- 
crat mocked them. “Let us not 
waste my time. The test missiles 
will be fired shortly to determine 
whether you have succeeded. I 
must be free to direct the imme- 
diate retaliatory measures.” 

“We It ay here, diahlel” the 
Frenchman roared defiantly. 

S TAUSMAN straightened, free- 
ing himself from Art’s grip, 
and lunged into the room. 

Nothing happened to the Ger- 
man. 

Abruptly, Art was aware of the 
accelerated clacking of his wrist 
counter. 

“Radiation!” the Russian ex- 
claimed frantically. 

“A little persuasion, gentlemen. 
I’m quite sure you’ll decide to 
enter.” 



Karneiv and Latour ran in- 
side. Art followed. Glancing over- 
head, he saw there were no video 
lenses, no speakers or micro- 
phones in this new chamber. 

“But there is nothing in here!” 
the Frenchman exclaimed. 

Their wrist counters had si- 
lenced abruptly with their de- 
parture from the corridor. 

“Psychology, perhaps,” Kar- 
neiv said unsteadily. “Fear psy- 
chology.” 

“Get across to the other cor- 
ridor,” Art urged, “before he 
closes that door too!” 

Running, they overtook Staus- 
man, who was still plodding for- 
ward. They grabbed his arms 
and pulled him along with them. 

Suddenly, a tongue of unseen 
fire licked at Art’s wrists, where 
the radiation counter and watch 
were strapped. 

Karneiv shouted hoarsely. 

Latour screamed in pain. 

Stausman collapsed and lay 
limp on the floor, his body twitch- 
ing as though wracked by high- 
voltage current, as he lay there 
among three long-dead invaders. 

Art staggered and fell. But he 
got up immediately and raced, 
terror-stricken, toward the exit 
ahead, his mouth an agony of 
hot coals. He cried out in anguish. 

Then he was tearing at the 
straps of his radiation counter 
and watch. He got them off and 
cast the instruments from him, 



148 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



their metal cases glowing red-hot. 

His shoes were smoking and he 
kicked them off as he ran. There 
was a nest of fire in his side, next 
to where the revolver was strap- 
ped. As he glanced down at the 
weapon, the smoldering holster 
burst into flame. 

“We’re in a selective induction 
field!” he shouted frantically. 

He seared his fingers unsnap- 
ping his belt buckle, to hurl the 
white-hot weapon from him. 

The Russian and the French- 
man had gotten rid of the metal 
on their bodies too — had kicked 
off their shoes which, even now, 
were bursting into flame from the 
heat of the inner nails. 

Art was three-fourths of the 
way across the room when he 
was almost deafened by the roar 
of exploding, super-heated cart- 
ridges in the chambers of their 
discarded revolvers. 

After an eternity of blinding 
pain, he lunged into the corridor, 
following Latour and Karneiv 
out of the chamber of torture. 

They dropped to the floor in 
the dimly lit passageway and lay 
there, exhausted, fighting the 
agony in their mouths where the 
metal of dental fillings had heat- 
ed under the effects of the induc- 
tion field. 

A S if hypnotized, they all 
watched the door slide shut, 
closing off the room behind them. 



“Stausman?” asked Latour. 

Art shook his head regretfully. 

“Plate under scalp?” Karneiv 
asked hesitatingly. 

Art nodded. “By now it’s just 
molten metal.” 

The overhead speaker rumbled 
harshly. “/ see there are still 
three of you, gentlemen. Now, 
let me see — I would guess that 
the Frenchman will be next. He 
seems to be the least capable of 
surviving.” 

Latour jumped up, his fists 
clenched. “I will outlive you, 
pig!” he roared. His face was con- 
torted with hate. 

“Easy, Latour.” Art tried to 
calm the enraged Frenchman. 
“Let’s not make it any more 
amusing for him.” 

Latour’s shoulders sagged des- 
pairingly. Then he looked dole- 
fully at Art. “But what will we 
do, capitaine? We have no wea- 
pons! We have not even the dig- 
nity Of wearing shoes. Je suis 
dans l’embarrass!” 

Art accepted Latour’s state- 
ment literally. “I’m a bit more 
than embarrassed,” he said. “I’m 
down to the where-in-hell-do-we- 
go-from-here feeling.” 

He brought his wrists up and 
inspected the red, blistered flesh 
where the heated metal of his 
watch and radiation counter had 
left ugly, raw wounds. His trous- 
ers were smoldering where the 
flaming holster had lain against 



SATAN'S SHRINE 



149 



them. He beat out the embers 
with his hands. 

The Russian was moaning 
softly, blowing on his burned 
wrists. “World national areas,” 
he asked thoughtfully. “How 
much they got to pay Autocrat?” 

Art leaned against the wall and 
closed his eyes. The physical pain 
of his wounds was being pushed 
into the background now by the 
returning internal effects of the 
excessive radiation. “Your area 
kicks in about a billion a year — 
mine a little more.” 

“And for what, me s amis?” the 
Frenchman asked before Kameiv 
could react to the information he 
had requested. “Only for to fill 
the pockets of /e diable, so he 
can pay his espionage agents and 
his governeurs for the national 
areas.” 

The Russian rose and shook 
his seared wrists, while he paced 
restlessly. “I say let Autocrat 
have his extorted money,” he 
said bitterly. “World should do 
what he want. I say leave Shrine 
alone.” 

“Give the devil his due, eh?” 
Art asked. 

“Eh, bien!” Latour spread his 
arms despairingly. “What is it 
he wants? He rule all the world — 
yet he stay in his Shrine as 
though he not exist at all. He 
seeks no acclaim — yet all must 
be his slaves.” 

“He wants only power. La- 



tour.” Art recalled the pictures 
he had seen of the short, stout 
dictator — pictures that empha- 
sized the cruel lines of his florid 
face. “A megalomaniac, who is 
determined that there be no 
armies in the world that might 
eventually be turned against him 
— no weapons that might be aim- 
ed at the Shrine.” 

“And this slavery, mon capi- 
taine — how long must it con- 
tinue?” 

“Supreme Autocrat,” Kameiv 
said stonily, “had secret of im- 
mortality from scientists even be- 
fore he build first shell of Shrine. 
Will live forever.” 

“It will go on,” Art added, 
“four thousand years at least. He 
has supplies and ammunition to 
last that long.” 

“Longer,” Kameiv corrected. 
“Can get more whenever he 
want.” 

Art walked away from the 
others before he leaned against 
the wall and surrendered to the 
revolt his tortured stomach had 
been spawning. 

t|tHEY were in one of the long, 
curving corridors again. But 
this time the arc was more pro- 
nounced and Art called attention 
to the fact that a more notice- 
able curve could only mean a 
smaller periphery. Which, in 
turn, indicated nearness to the 
center of the Shrine.

He walked almost in a daze, 
his face flushed and his pulse 
pounding. The nausea was gone, 
but in its place was a thirst that 
was almost as torturous. 

“Water!” the Russian shouted 
excitedly, staggering forward. 

Puzzled, Art raced after him 
to prevent any lengthening of 
distance between them that might 
put Karneiv out of sight. 

Ahead, in the center of the tun- 
nel, was a plain- table. On its 
surface was a huge pitcher and 
several glasses. 

“Don’t, Kameiv!” Art warned. 
“Don’t drink it!” 

The Russian ignored the warn- 
ing. He grasped the pitcher be- 
tween his large hands and raised 
it to his mouth. After he had 
finished drinking, he handed the 
container to the Frenchman. 

“Good!” Karneiv exclaimed 
exuberantly. 

“But it might be — ” Art cut 
the sentence short, watching La- 
tour drink. 

“What the hell!” the Russian 
shrugged. “If it ffoison, it good 
poison.” 

Art took the pitcher from La- 
tour and sipped from it. The 
water was ice cold and it swept 
away the fire that had been 
blazing in his raw throat. 

“Now that we have refreshed 
ourselves, gentlemen, let us pre- 
pare for the next check point.” 

The three men started, then re- 



garded each other hesitatingly. 

“You will notice that on your 
left is a straight passage.” 

Art stared distrustfully into 
the radial tunnel he hadn’t no- 
ticed before. But he could see 
nothing. In the absence of a light- 
ing system, it was but a yawn- 
ing void. 

“ One of you will enter it. The 
other two will continue ahead. 
It is necessary that the party be 
split into smaller components at 
this point. I have prepared some- 
thing special, but only two can 
be accommodated.” 

“We no separate!” Karneiv 
shouted in the direction of the 
closest microphone. 

“/ think you will, gentlemen. 
I have very efficient methods of 
coercion, as you already realize.” 
Art tried to produce mental 
pictures of the possible tortures 
that might lie ahead for the two 
who would continue along the 
peripheral corridor. 

“I’ll go on ahead,” he said to 
Latour. “You and Kameiv de- 
cide who will go with me.” 
Laughter erupted in the speak- 
ers. “I’m afraid I’m misunder- 
stood. Ahead lies something in- 
teresting, of course. But the dark 
corridor offers only — immediate 
death.” 

A RT leaned against the table, 
his head lowered in despair. 
“Then whoever continues,” he 



SATAN'S SHRINE 



151 



said meditatively, “will have the 
only chance of reaching — ” He 
tilted, his head in the direction of 
the speakers. “Looking at the 
problem objectively,” he said, 
“I’m in the worst physical condi- 
tion and am of least value.” He 
headed toward the dark corridor. 

Latour grabbed his arm. “Non, 
mon capitaine!” 

Kameiv pulled the French- 
man away. “Let him go. He sick. 
He no help for the cause. You, 
me — we get to Autocrat.” 

“Never will we reach him!” 
Latour’s voice rose in rejection 
of the Russian’s optimism. “And 
no longer will I, Latour, do as 
he directs!” 

“You will all do as I direct /” 
the Supreme Autocrat declared. 
“I have only to inform you that 
there are selective induction coils 
in the walls. And these particu- 
lar ones are tuned so their effects 
will be felt in material much 
softer than metal.” 

“You lie!” Latour shouted. 
Then to Art, “Is it not impossible 
that he can have all this Shrine 
wired like one magnificent coil? 
He— bluffs!” 

Art pushed him off gently. “Go 
with Kameiv.” 

Then he stepped into the un- 
lit corridor. 

The stone panel started to 
close behind him. 

But Latour lunged through at 
the last second. Immediately af- 



terward, the stone thudded 
against its stop behind them. 

“You fool!” Art told the 
Frenchman. “He’ll—” 

Kameiv’ s frantic screams, bare- 
ly audible, erupted in the outer 
corridor. The terrorized out- 
bursts continued for almost a 
minute, as Art and Latour lis- 
tened, stunned in the darkness. 
Then they ended abruptly. 

“Ah!” exclaimed the French- 
man in a whisper. “Monsieur le 
diable has tried to trick us, n’est 
pas?” His voice rose excitedly. 
“Was it not in this corridor that 
he said was the certain death? 
Yet, as soon as the door is closed, 
it is the other one that becomes 
fatal. Eh bien! It was his desire 
to kill two of us that time and to 
permit only one to live.” 

“You have guessed right. 
Frenchman.” The Autocrat’s 
voice sounded in the darkness. 
“And you have interfered with 
my schedule. But it makes no 
difference. The end result will 
be the same.” 

Art reached for the French- 
man’s shoulders, pulled him 
closer. “Without lights,” he whis- 
pered, “he can’t track us with his 
video system. If we keep quiet, 
he won’t be able to follow us 
through the mikes either.” 
“Then we proceed?” Latour 
asked eagerly. 

Art went ahead silently. “On 
tiptoe, if necessary.” 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“But — ” the other lowered his 
voice — “can he not turn on the 
lights whenever he wishes?” 
“There are no lights in this 
corridor. I saw that as I entered.” 
Art guided himself with a 
hand along the wall. 

“And the doors,” the French- 
man suggested. “Is it not pos- 
sible that we may reach one be- 
fore he thinks to close it? Then 
we may go through several more 
without le diable knowing it. We 
will be lost from him, n’est pas?" 

ME was endless as they felt 
their way in the tunnel. Art 
guessed a half-hour had passed 
when the Frenchman tightened 
his grip on his shoulder. 

“The doors — we have reached 
none of them yet, capitaine?” he 
whispered. ►- 

Art considered not telling him, 
but decided it would be better 
to be frank. “We’ve passed a 
helluva lot of doors — all closed.” 
Latour gasped. “Then he has 
made the preparations for us al- 
ready! It is no use, mon ami. 
Le diable still herds us — like 
swine.” 

“Latour!” 

“Yes?” 

“Ahead — there’s a light!” 
They stopped. Faint illumina- 
tion, only a hundred feet or so 
ahead, bared the end of the cor- 
ridor. But Art could not discern 
the 'light’s source. 



The Frenchman swore. “A — 
how you call it? — dead end. Now 
we will starve without ever find- 
ing our way out — ” 

“No, Latour. Look — the cor- 
ridor turns right! That’s where 
the light’s coming from.” 
Silently, they went ahead. 

Close to the juncture. Art 
pressed his back to the wall and 
inched forward. Then, even more 
cautiously, he peered around the 
corner. He jerked his head back 
immediately. 

“Latour!” His whisper was 
barely audible. “It’s the Auto- 
crat! He’s right around the 
bend!” 

The Frenchman tensed, open- 
ed his mouth. But Art clamped a 
hand oyer it. 

“He’s in the corridor — not thir- 
ty feet away — waiting!” 

“Did he see you?” 

“No.” 

“Sacrebleu! What does he do?” 
“Nothing. He’s just standing 
there.” 

“A trap!” 

“No. His hands are empty. 
There are no weapons.” 

Art hazarded another glance. 
Jornal Sakoran stood with his 
hands hanging by his sides. There 
was an expression of impatience 
on his face. 

“Le diable — he is still there?” 
Latour gripped his arm. 

Art nodded absently. Con- 
founded, he tried to imagine what 



SATAN'S SHRINE 



153 



the ruse might be. Certainly, the 
one-time national dictator who 
had seized control of a world 
centuries ago could not be sub- 
mitting to capture now. Nor was 
it possible that he could be un- 
aware of two survivors of an ex- 
peditionary force who were dan- 
gerously close. Yet . 

With an abruptness that took 
him by surprise, Latour brushed 
by and lunged around the cor- 
ner. Art sprang after him, but the 
Frenchman had a lead of more 
than ten feet. Sakoran looked up, 
smiling. 

At- the last moment. Art sensed 
the trap and desperately tried 
to brake himself. “Latour/” he 
screamed. “Don’t — •” 

It was too late. Electrical 
flames crackled, enveloping La- 
tour’s body in brilliant, consum- 
ing light. Smoke hissed from his 
charred figure, even as he drop- 
ped lifelessly to the floor. At the 
same time, there was the crash- 
ing sound of shattering glass, 
and the image of the Autocrat 
blanked out. 

Art, horrified, drew up before 
the smashed electronic screen 
that had completely blocked the 
corridor and had presented the 
three-dimensional telecast image 
of Sakoran while it also served 
as an indiscernible death trap. 

But even with the illumination 
gone from the now dead screen, 
there was still light in the cor- 



ridor. It came from around an- 
other bend in the passageway 
beyond. 

D AZED, Art numbly stepped 
through the jagged remnants 
of the screen, around the smolder- 
ing body of the Frenchman. 

He knew that the invulner- 
ability of the Shrine was no myth. 
Truly, the Supreme Autocrat was 
invincible. He had killed Staus- 
man, Karneiv, Latour, the scores 
who were now only skeletons in 
the corridors, with incredible 
ease. But wasn’t that to be ex- 
pected? Hadn’t he had centuries 
to learn how to slaughter? 

Art lowered his head dejectedly 
as he continued forward. He went 
around a bend and jolted to a 
stop, rigid with astonishment. 

Immediately ahead, the pas- 
sageway widened into a great cir- 
cular compartment, almost a 
hundred yards in diameter. 

It was the Inner Shrine! 

Great gleaming instruments, 
scores of control panels that were 
clusters of switches and dials and 
levers, gauges and indicators and 
^purring machinery — all occupied 
every available space along the 
perimeter of the room. Overhead, 
hundreds of luminescent screens 
covered the tremendous curved 
ceiling — the nerve-center of the 
Autocrat’s worldwide communi- 
cations network. 

In the middle of the impres- 



154 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



sive chamber was a smaller dome 
of lead, a fifty-foot-high bubble 
whose standard arrangement of 
flashing red lights identified it as 
the Shrine’s nuclear power pack 

a reactor pile! One that, if 

made to exceed its safety limits, 
could be as devastating as a 
thousand nuclear devices like the 
one Art and the other members of 
his expedition had brought with 
them in the twin metal con- 
tainers ! 

But there was no sign of the 
Autocrat. Was this only another 
check point? 

Bewildered, Art entered the 
room. 

It was no trap ! He stood among 
the glistening array of instru- 
ments and controls. He was in the 
vulnerable center of the most im- 
pregnable fortress ever built! 

He saw the doorway between 
two towering instrument cases 
along the wall on his left. He 
peered in cautiously. He could 
see what appeared to be living 
quarters — plush chairs, tapestries, 
thick carpets, the edge of a bed. 

The door swung wide and the 
Supreme Autocrat stepped from 
concealment, a gun in his hand. 

Art swore. He had been de- 
feated by his own curiosity! He 
should have raced for the nuclear 
pile and . 

“Come in,” said Sakoran. He 
motioned with the gun and swung 
to the side as Art entered. 



Then the Autocrat sighed 
deeply and smiled. But it wasn’t 
a smile of derision ! It was a warm 
smile of welcome. 

“Don’t be alarmed,” he said. 
“The weapon will be used on 
me — not you. But I fear I may 
need it to hold you off until I am 
ready.” 

OPEECHLESS, Art fell back- 
ward until he sensed there 
was a chair behind him. Then he 
fell sitting in it. 

The Autocrat, dressed in a 
long, gray robe, , leaned against 
a table in the center of the elab- 
orately comfortable room. 

“I thought, for a while, the 
Frenchman would be the success- 
ful candidate,” he said. “There 
was much to be commended in 
his devotion to your cause and 
his general sense of fraternity and 
sympathy. But it was his loyalty 
that disqualified him. It was ap- 
parent that he would have im- 
mediately told the world about 
the Shrine.” 

Art continued to stare incredu- 
lously at Jornal Sakoran, the im- 
mortal dictator, the Supreme 
Autocrat of The Associated 
Nations. There was an incon- 
gruity somewhere — an incon- 
gruity over and above the 
impossible developments of the 
past few minutes. But he was 
unable to define it. 

“However,” Sakoran continued, 



SATAN'S SHRINE 



155 



§ 



“I found myself incapable of an 
unbiased decision. So I let the 
electronic screen decide. The 
Frenchman eliminated himself.” 
“Eliminated ... 7” Art re- 
peated densely. 

“Of course. The check points 
are a process of elimination by 
which all but the strongest are 
discarded and the one most fit 
to assume — ” 

Art leaped up. “You killed my 
father!” 

“Your father?” Sakoran’s hand 
tightened on the gun and Art re- 
laxed again. “Did he come here 
with one of the expeditions? 
Which one?” 

“Number Eighty-five.” 

Sakoran shook his head. “Be- 
fore my time, I’m afraid. Any- 
way, that was not a changeover 
expedition. No, I did not kill 
your father. You see, I wasn’t 
Satan at the time.” 

“You weren’t Satan?” Art re- 
peated, stunned. 

“No — I became the Supreme 
Autocrat two years later. Ex- 
pedition Eighty-seven.” 

Art fell back into the chair. 
Now he recognized the incon- 
sistency that he had felt on first 
looking at the Autocrat. The man 
before him was tall, gaunt. His 
eyes were blue. And his hair, al- 
though gray now, had no doubt 
been blond when he was' younger. 
While Jornal Sakoran, the French 
dictator who had built the im- 



pregnable Shrine, had been short, 
stout — had black, crimped hair 
and intense dark eyes! 

Sakoran was not immortal! 
Sakoran was dead! 

“You see,” the Autocrat con- 
tinued, “I am Satan the Four- 
teenth. But, about the elimina- 
tions and the check points — as 
I was explaining, their end result 
was your selection as Satan the 
Fifteenth. I feel sure that you 
will make a very efficient Su- 
preme Autocrat.” 

A LMOST a minute later, Art 
overcame his astonishment. 
“I don’t understand.” 

“It’s rather difficult to explain,” 
the Autocrat said. “Let me start 
off by saying that the deaths in 
the corridor, sadistic as they 
seem, are necessary. First, there 
can be no more than one Satan 
at a time. Even minor differences 
of opinion, or inherent concern 
for the welfare of a particular na- 
tion, might wreck the effective- 
ness of the Shrine. 

“You see, not all expeditionary 
groups meet the same fate as 
yours — only the changeover ones, 
of which yours was the thirteenth. 
Of the remaining eighty expedi- 
tions, all were executed quite 
humanely. They had to be killed 
to protect the Shrine as well as 
to prevent their possible escape 
and betrayal to the world of the 
true nature of the Shrine. And — ” 



156 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“But why — why?” Art shouted. 

“Why must there be a succes- 
sion of Satans?” the Autocrat 
rephrased the question. “I’ll try 
to explain. When Sakoran es- 
tablished his Shrine as a means 
of despotic control over his na- 
tion, Earth had just fought the 
Third War. 

“It was not a pleasant chapter 
in history, I assure you. Over a 
hundred million persons all over 
the world were annihilated in the 
war. All world governments were 
bankrupt. Poverty was rampant. 
Then came new distrust and, 
even with the millstone of desti- 
tution around its neck, humanity 
plunged into another armament 
race. 

“In the year Sakoran seized 
control of France, the leading 
powers spent a total of more than 
eight hundred billion for weapons 
and armies. By comparison, the 
nations now expend a total of 
about thirty billion annually on 
two items — one, forced consign- 
ment of capital to governors ap- 
pointed by the Shrine — two, 
secret appropriations for weapons 
to attack the Shrine. There is 
quite a difference between eight 
hundred billion — and thirty bil- 
lion. 

“And there is also a difference 
between the thousand men who 
are serving the Secret Corps and 
the millions who would be serv- 
ing in the armies of the world, if 



there were no Shrine to outlaw 
those armies and their weapons 
under the pretense of self-defense 
for Satan.” 

“You mean the whole setup is 
— insurance against war?” Art 
asked incredulously. 

The Autocrat nodded. “Hu- 
manity’s greatest debt of grati- 
tude belongs to Jornal Sakoran, 
the despot. The greatest year 
the race ever knew was the one 
in which he was able to extend 
his rule over all world powers, 
merely by dropping a few missiles 
on key cities and demonstrating 
the invulnerability of his Shrine 
when the counter-attacks came.” 

“But Sakoran? What happened 
to him?” 

“The sixth expedition into the 
Shrine was successful, as you will 
read in the records here. How- 
ever only one member survived 
in that group. It is a good thing 
for the world that he was a man 
of foresight. After he killed Sa- 
koran, he became Satan II, suc- 
cessfully repelling all other in- 
vasions of the Shrine until he 
realized he was too old to con- 
tinue in his role. He then allowed 
one member of Expedition Seven- 
teen to survive the elimination 
tests that he had devised. 

“Satan II wondered, at first, 
whether other candidates in the 
future would be instilled with the 
same principles as he was — 
whether they would be willing to 



SATAN'S SHRINE

He raised the gun relievedly to 
his temple. 

“Wait!” Art shouted. “Sup- 
pose I don’t want to be the — 
the Autocrat?” 

“You have no choice. All the 
avenues of escape are sealed off. 
When you learn how to open 
them, I believe you will have 
changed your mind.” 

After a pause, he went on. “In 
a year or two, you will learn how 
to control all the devices in the 
Shrine. And, until you do, any 
expedition which comes along 
will be disposed of automatically. 
Even the firing of the interceptor 
missiles will be out of your juris- 
diction temporarily.” 

“But how . ?” 

“You’ll be instructed by auto- 
matic recorded tapes and visual 
educational aids through the 
medium of several of the ceiling 
screens.” He stared unseeingly 
at Art. “And now, son — I’m a 
tired, old man ...” 

The Shrine shivered almost 
imperceptibly and the faintest of 
rumblings reached Art’s ears. 

“Those are our interceptor 
rockets going off to meet the 
probing missiles,” the Supreme 
Autocrat said. “You will have 
to retaliate immediately if you 
expect to preserve discipline and 
respect. The controls you’ll need 
are immediately beyond that 
door — the first panel on your 
right.” 



TVTUMBLY, Art went out the 
-*■ ’ door, stood before the panel. 

A screen overhead repeatedly 
flashed the words Missile Origin. 
It went 'blank a moment, then 
came on again with a map of 
South America. Most of the map 
faded from the screen, leaving 
only the impression of Argentina. 

In front of him were scores of 
control studs, each designated 
with the name of a different city. 
He found the one marked Buenos 
Aires and adjusted the vernier 
control slightly, watching the re- 
sults of his manipulation on the 
map overhead. 

A small x-mark, indicating 
where the retaliatory missile 
would strike, moved southward. 
When he was sure he had dis- 
placed it to an area where there 
would be a minimum of casual- 
ties, he pressed the button. 

The Supreme Autocrat’s gun 
went off almost at the same time 
in the other room. 

Art glanced over at a blank 
area on the wall next to the door. 
On the space was written a list 
of Satans. The last entry was 
Arnold Stolman, Satan XIV, 
2968-2996 A. D. 

He felt the faint vibration as 
the retaliatory missile fired. 

With a heavy pencil that was 
on the control panel, he added: 

“Art Grant, Satan XV, 2996- 

A. D.”

you to ENJOY the finest without worrying 
about the cost, the Club has arranged to bring 
you these brand-new full-length books FOR 
ONLY $1 EACH (plus a few cents shipping 
charge) — even though they cost $2.50, $2.75 
and up in publishers’ original editions! 

Each selection is described WELL IN AD- 
VANCE, in the Club’s interesting free bulletin, 
“Things Come.’’ You take ONLY those 
books you really want — as few as four a year, 
if you wish. If you don’t want the current 
selection, you notify the Club. There are no 
other rules, no dues, no fees.

“National areas are already be-

national areas. But there is still 
much progress to be made. An- 



other five hundred years, perhaps 
another thousand. Our most posi- 
tive indication of advance in that 
direction will be the era in which 
the world discontinues sending 
expeditions to destroy the Shrine. 
When that day comes, the Satans 
will have to devise other means 
of perpetuating themselves. But 
that won’t concern you.” 

The Supreme Autocrat held 
the gun up before him and looked 
at it thoughtfully. 

“I’m so glad you’ve come,” he 
said plaintively. “It’s been hard — 
lonely. I’ve killed hundreds. And, 
all the while, I could never be 
sure that it was — right.”
