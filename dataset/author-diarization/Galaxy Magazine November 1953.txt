T HERE ARE some things that can not be generally told — things you 
ought to know. Great truths are dangerous to some— but factors for 
personal power and accomplishment in the hands of those who under- 
stand them. Behind the tales of the miracles and mysteries of the 
ancients, lie centuries of their secret probing into nature's laws — their 
amazing discoveries of the hidden processes of naan's mind, and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shrouded in mystery to avoid their 
destruction by mass fear and ignorance, these facts remain a useful 
heritage for the thousands of men and women who privately use them 
in their homes today.

THAT'S LIFE , f 7C. 



VVTITH a little practice, any- 
** one can be a cliche expert. 
There is a choice of diplomas: 
either a look of pained contempt 
or amused pity. Some sophisti- 
cates own both. The ability to 
recognize a cliche and scorn it is 
a necessary passport to literate 
circles. 

Intolerance is justified, of 
course. Through incessant repe- 
tition, cliches become mere au- 
tomatic verbal responses to given 
stimuli. 

But there ought to be a post- 
graduate course, for few things 
are harder to manufacture than 
cliches. A successful cliche - is 
(or was originally) the keenest 
view of a subject and the most 
concise way of expressing it. 

Psychology textbooks need 
chapters to state: What can’t be 
cured must be endured; take it 
(an insult or hurt) whence it 
comes ; sticks and stones may 
break my bones, but names can 
never hurt me; that’s life; go 
fight City Hall; here today , gone 
tomorrow; into every life a little 
rain must fall; this, too, shall 
pass; every cloud has a silver 
lining. 

The trouble is not the content 
or phrasing of the clich£— except 
that, if done with extreme acute- 
ness and compression, the 



observation becomes easy to re- 
member and use. People are not 
likely to say: The tendency to 
dwell on past errors is an in- 
dication of emotional immaturity 
and must be rigorously checked 
by recognition of the fact that 
no amount of such regret can 
alter a prior experience. Not 
when the same lesson can be 
put this clearly: Don’t cry over 
spilled milk. 

Whoever first said It’s not the 
heat ; it’s the humidity undoubt- 
edly made a first-rate scientific 
observation and did so with the 
word-economy of a Newton or, 
for that matter, a Shakespeare. 

The actual difference between 
a cliche and a potential one is 
purely subject matter. Many 
masterpieces of clarity and pithi- 
ness don’t — well, make the grade 
because they’re too specialized. A 
statement must be usable often 
and widely before it can qualify 
as a cliche. 

Remember Poe’s “The Pur- 
loined Letter”? He showed that 
the best place to hide something 
is right out in full view, where 
it's sure to be overlooked. Well, 
a guaranteed way to take over 
an alien wprld is to inflict its 
knowledge on it in the form of 
cliches. Finding a startling truth 
in a brilliant new simplification 



THAT'S LIFE, 



ETC. 



S 




is a lot easier than peeling the 
verdigris off an old one. 

When a statement that quali- 
fies in every way somehow fails 
to achieve clichedom in 400 
years, I suppose it never will. I 
don’t understand how Michel- 
angelo's Only work can eliminate 
the traces of work escaped. It 
was fortunate for me that it did 
— not having been deafened to 
his lesson, I was able to apply 
it to my writing and editing. This 
editorial you’re reading, for ex- 
ample, is the fifth version I’ve 
written. Whatever you may think 
of it, it’s clearer and more read- 
able than the first four, which is 
all Michelangelo was saying. 

There are two other entrants 
that I’m anxious to share, though 
I know they won’t ever be petri- 
fied into standard speech. 

One is by the late Supreme 
Court Justice Oliver Wendell 
Holmes: Continuity with the past 
is not a duty; it is only a neces- 
sity. 

Any number of civilizations 
might have been saved from ex- 
tinction if they’d been relieved 
of mandatory veneration of the 
past Literally, there’s no future 
in ancestor worship. 

Holmes’s injunction also has 
considerable personal value. Un- 
due attachment to. one’s own past 
can be equally ritualistic and 
equally disastrous. 

As a possible cliche, his state- 



ment might, like Ontogeny re- 
capitulates phytogeny, have a 
very restricted currency. Certain- 
ly neither one fits broad daily 
needs. 

The same, of course, is true 
of Mankind is just emerging from 
antiquity, which was said by 
Bernard Berenson, octogenarian 
philosopher and expert on Italian 
painting. 

“Oh, we are, are we?” is a 
good healthy first reaction. “And 
how about all our scientific prog- 
ress? What other era in history 
can match it?” 

Exactly. No other era can . 
which is why many people, per- 
haps the majority, blame our cur- 
rent problems on science. But no 
blame is called for if it’s true 
that mankind is just emerging 
from antiquity. 

Our discoveries are not at fault. 
We primitively use them as big- 
ger and more destructive bal- 
listae, our bomb shelters are 
larger shields, and radioactivity 
and disease germs are only the 
present-day equivalent of plow- 
ing salt into the soil of Carthage 
so nothing may ever grow there 
again. - 

See what I mean? I needed 
all this room to explain the con- 
cept. A historian would devote 
a whole book to it. 

Berenson made the point in six 
words.

KEEP 

YOUR 

SHAPE 

By ROBERT SHECKIEY 

IHttttraM by VIDMtt 



P 1D the Pilot slowed the 
ship almost to a stand- 
still, and peered anxious- 
ly at the green planet below. 

Even without instruments, 
there was no mistaking it. Third 
from its sun, it was the only 
planet in this system capable of 
sustaining life. Peacefully it 
swam beneath its gauze of clouds. 

It looked very innocent. And 
yet, twenty previous Grom ex- 

keep your shape 



peditions had set out to prepare 
this planet for invasion — and 
vanished utterly, without a word. 

Pid hesitated only a moment, 
before starting irrevocably down. 
There was no point in hovering 
and worrying. He and his two 
crewmen were as ready now as 
they would ever be. Their com- 
pact Displacers were stored in 
body pouches, inactive but ready. 

Pid wanted to say something 

5 ' 




to his crew, but wasn’t sure how 
to put it. 

The crew waited. Ilg the Ra- 
dioman had sent the final mes- 
sage to the Grom planet Ger the 
Detector read sixteen dials at 
once, and reported, “No sign of 
alien activity,” His body sur- 
faces flowed carelessly. 

N oticing the flow, Pid knew 

what to say to his crew. Ever 
since they had left Grom, shape- 
discipline had been disgustingly 
lax. The Invasion Chief had 
warned him; but still, he had to 
do something about it. It was his 
duty, since lower castes such as 
Radiomen and Detectors were 
notoriously prone to Shapeless- 
ness. 

“A lot of hopes are resting on 
this expedition,” he began slowly. 
“We’re a long way from home 
now.” t 

Ger the Detector nodded. Ilg 
the Radioman flowed out of his 
prescribed shape and molded 
himself comfortably to a wall. 

“However,” Pid said sternly, 
“distance is no excuse for pro- 
miscuous Shapelessness.” 

Ilg flowed hastily back into 
proper Radioman’s shape. 

“Exotic forms will undoubt- 
edly be called for,” Pid went on. 
“And for that we have a special 
dispensation. But remember — any 
shape not assumed strictly in the 
line of duty is a foul, lawless de- 



vice of The Shapeless One!” 
Ger’s body surfaces abruptly 
stopped flowing. 

“That’s all,” Pid said, and 
flowed into his controls. The ship 
started down, so smoothly co- 
ordinated that Pid felt a glow of 
pride. 

They were good workers, he 
decided. He just couldn’t expect 
them to be as shape-conscious as 
a high- caste Pilot. Even the In- 
vasion Chief had told him that. 

“Pid,” the Invasion Chief had 
said at their last interview, . “we 
need this planet desperately.” 
“Yes, sir,” Pid had said, stand- 
ing at full attention, never quiv- 
ering from Optimum Pilot’s 
Shape. 

“One of you,” the Chief said 
heavily, “must get through and 
set up a Displacer near an atomic 
power source. The army will be 
standing by at this end, ready to 
step through.” 

“We’ll do it, sir,” Pid said. 
“This expedition has to suc- 
ceed,” the. Chief said, and his 
features blurred momentarily 
from sheer fatigue. “In strictest 
confidence, there’s considerable 
unrest on Grom. The Miner caste 
is on strike, for instance. They 
want a new digging shape. Say 
the old one is inefficient.” 

Pid looked properly indignant. 
The Mining Shape had been set 
down by the Ancients fifty thou- 
sand years ago, together with the

KEEP YOUR SHAPE

rest of the basic shapes. And now 
these upstarts wanted to change 
it! 

“That’s not all,” the Chief told 
him, “We’ve uncovered a new 
Cult of Shapelessness. Picked up 
almost eight thousand Grom, and 
I don’t know how many more 
we missed.” 

Pid knew that Shapelessness 
was a lure of The Shapeless One, 
the greatest evil that the Grom 
mind could conceive of. But why, 
he wondered, did so many Grom 
fall for His lures? 

npHE Chief guessed his ques- 
tion. “Pid,” he said,- “I sup- 
pose it’s difficult for you to 
understand. Do you enjoy Pilot- 
ing?” 

“Yes, sir,” Pid said simply. 
Enjoy Piloting! It was his entire 
life! Without a ship, he was noth- 
ing. 

“Not all Grom feel that way ” 
the Chief said. “I don’t under- 
stand it either. All my ancestors 
have been Invasion Chiefs, back 
to the beginning of time. So of 
course I want to be an Invasion 
Chief. It’s only natural, as well 
as lawful, But the lower castes 
don’t feel that way.” The Chief 
shook his body sadly. “I've told 
you this for a reason. We Grom 
need more room. This unrest is 
caused purely by crowding. All 
our psychologists say so. An- 
other planet to expand into will 



cure everything. So we’re count- 
ing on you, Pid.” 

“Yes, sir,” Pid said, with a glow 
of pride. 

The Chief rose to end the in- 
terview. Then he changed his 
mind and sat down again. 

“You’ll have to watch your 
crew,” he said. “They’re loyal, 
no doubt, but low- caste. And you 
know the lower castes.” 

Pid did indeed. 

“Ger, your Detector, is sus- 
pected of harboring Alterationist 
tendencies. He was once fined for 
assuming a quasi-Hunter, shape, 
Ilg has never had any definite 
charge brought against him. But 
I hear that, he remains immobile 
for suspiciously long periods of 
time. Possibly, he fancies him- 
self a Thinker.” 

“But, sir,” Pid protested. “If 
they are even slightly tainted 
with Alterationism or Shapeless- 
ness, why send them on this ex- 
pedition?” 

The Chief hesitated before an- 
swering. “There are plenty of 
Grom I could trust,” he said 
slowly. “But those two have cer- 
tain qualities of resourcefulness 
and imagination that will be 
needed on this expedition.” He 
sighed. “I really don’t understand 
why those qualities are usually 
linked with Shapelessness.” 

“Yes, sir,” Pid said. 

“Just watch them.” 

“Yes, sir,” Pid said again, and

saluted, realizing that the inter- 
view was at an end. In his body 
pouch he felt the dormant Dis- 
placer, ready to transform the 
enemy’s power source into a 
bridge across space for the Grom 
hordes. 

“Good luck,” the chief said. 
“I’m sure you’ll need it.” 

T HE ship dropped silently to- 
ward the surface of the enemy 
planet. Ger the Detector analyzed 
the clouds below, and fed data 
into the Camouflage Unit. The 
Unit went to work. Soon the ship 
looked, to all outward appear- 
ances, like a cirrus formation. 

Pid allowed the ship to drift 
slowly toward the surface of the 
mystery planet. He was in Op- 
timum Pilot’s Shape now, the 
most efficient of the four shapes 
alloted to the Pilot caste. Blind, 
deaf and dumb, an extension of 
his controls, all his attention was 
directed toward matching the ve- 
locities of the high-flying clouds, 
staying among them, becoming a 
part of them. 

Ger remained rigidly in one of 
the two shapes alloted to Detec- 
tors. He fed data into the Cam- 
ouflage Unit, and the descending 
ship slowly altered into an alto- 
cumulus. 

There was no sign of activity 
from the enemy planet. 

Ilg located an atomic power 
source, and fed the data to Pid. 



The Pilot altered course. He had 
reached the lowest level of 
clouds, barely a mile above the 
surface of the planet. Now his 
ship looked like a fat, fleecy cum- 
ulus. 

And still there was no sign of 
alarm. The unknown fate that 
had overtaken twenty previous 
expeditions still had not showed 
itself. 

Dusk crept across the face of 
the planet as Pid maneuvered 
near the atomic power installa- 
tion. He avoided the surrounding 
homes and hovered over a clump 
of woods. 

Darkness fell, and the green 
planet’s lone moon was veiled in 
clouds, 

One cloud floated lower. 

And landed. 

“Quick, everyone out!” Pid 
shouted, detaching himself from 
the ship’s controls. He assumed 
the Pilot’s Shape best suited for 
running, and raced out the hatch. 
Ger and Ilg hurried after him. 
They stopped fifty yards from 
the ship, and waited. 

Inside the ship a little-used 
circuit closed. There was a silent 
shudder, and the ship began to 
melt. Plastic dissolved, metal 
crumpled. Soon the ship was a 
great pile of junk, and still the 
process went on. Big fragments 
broke into smaller fragments, and 
split, and split again. 

Pid felt suddenly helpless, 



KEEP YOUR* SHAPE

watching his ship scuttle itself. 
He was a Pilot, of the Pilot caste. 
His father had been a Pilot, and 
his father before him, stretching 
back to the hazy past when 'the 
Grom had first constructed ships. 
He had spent his entire child- 
hood around ships, his entire 
manhood flying them. 

Now, shipless, he was naked in 
an alien world. 

TN a few minutes there was only 

a mound of dust to show where 
the ship had been. The night wind 
scattered it through the forest. 
And then there was nothing at 
all. 

They waited. Nothing hap- 
pened. The wind sighed and the 
trees creaked. Squirrels chirped, 
and birds stirred in their nests. An 
acorn fell to the ground. 

Pid heaved a sigh of relief and 
sat down. The twenty-first Grom 
expedition had landed safely. 

There was nothing to be done 
until morning, so Pid began to 
make plans. They had landed as 
close to the atomic power installa- 
tion as they dared. Now they 
would have to get closer. Some- 
how, one of them had to get very 
near the reactor room, in order to 
activate the Displacer. 

Difficult. But Pid felt certain 
of success. After all, the Grom 
were strong on ingenuity. 

Strong on ingenuity, he thought 
bitterly, but terribly short of ra- 



dioactives. That was another 
reason why this expedition was 
so important. There was little 
radioactive fuel left, on any of 
the Grom worlds. Ages ago, the 
Grom had spent their store of 
radioactives in spreading through- 
out their neighboring worlds, oc- 
cupying the ones that they could 
live on. 

Now, colonization barely kept 
up with the mounting birthrate. 
New worlds were constantly 
needed. 

This particular world, discov- 
ered in a scouting expedition, 
was needed. It suited the Grom 
perfectly. But it was too far 
away. They didn’t have enough 
fuel to mount a conquering space 
fleet. 

Luckily, there was another 
way. A better way. 

Over the centuries, the Grom 
scientists had developed the Dis- 
placer. A triumph of Identity 
Engineering, the Displacer al- 
lowed mass to be moved instan- 
taneously between any two linked 
points. 

One end was set up at Grom’s 
sole atomic energy plant. The 
other end had to be placed in 
promixity to another atomic pow- 
er source, and activated. Divert- 
ed power then flowed through 
both ends, was modified, and 
modified again. 

Then, through the miracle of 
Identity Engineering, the Grom 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




could step through from planet to 
planet; or pour through in a 
great, overwhelming wave. 

It was quite simple, 

But twenty expeditions had 
failed to set up the Earth- end 
Displacer. 

What had happened to them 
was not known. 

For no Grom ship had ever re- 
turned to tell. 

B EFORE dawn they crept 
through the woods, taking on 
the coloration of the plants 
around them. Their Displacers 
pulsed feebly, sensing the near- 
ness of atomic energy. 

A tiny, four-legged creature 
darted in front of them. Instantly, 
Ger grew four legs and a long, 
streamlined body and gave chase. 

“Ger! Come back here!” Pid 
howled at the Detector, throw- 
ing caution to the winds. 

Ger overtook the animal and 
knocked it down. He tried to bite 
it, but he had neglected to grow 
teeth. The animal jumped free, 
and vanished into the under- 
brush. Ger thrust out & set of 
teeth and bunched his muscles 
for another leap. 

“Ger/” 

Reluctantly, the Detector turn- 
ed away. He loped silently back 
to Pid. 

“I was hungry,” he said. 

“You were not,” Pid said stern- 
ly. 



“Was,” Ger mumbled, writh- 
ing with embarrassment. 

Pid remembered what the Chief 
had told him. Ger certainly did 
have Hunter tendencies. He 
would have to watch him more 
closely. 

“We’ll have no more of that,” 
Pid said. “Remember — the lure 
of Exotic Shapes is not sanc- 
tioned. Be content with the shape 
you were born to.” 

Ger nodded, and melted back 
into the underbrush. They moved 
on. 

At the extreme edge of the 
woods they could observe the 
atomic energy ( installation. Pid 
disguised himself as a clump of 
shrubbery, and Ger formed him- 
self into an old log. Ilg, after a 
moment’s thought, became a 
young oak. 

The installation was in the 
form of a long, low building, sur- 
rounded by a metal fence. There 
was a gate, and guards in front 
of it, 

The first job, Pid thought, was 
to get past that gate. He began 
to consider ways and means.. 

From the fragmentary reports 
of the survey parties, Pid knew 
that, in some ways, this race of 
Men were like the Grom. They 
had pets, as the Grom did, and 
homes and children, and a cul- 
ture, The inhabitants were skilled 
mechanically, as were the Grom. 

But there were terrific differ - 



KEEP YOUR SHAPE 



11 




ences, also. The Men were of 
fixed and immutable form,, like 
stones or trees. And to compen- 
sate, their planet boasted a fan- 
tastic array of species, types and 
kinds. This was completely un- 
like Grom, which had only eight 
distinct forms of animal life. 

And evidently, the Men were 
skilled at detecting invaders, Pid 
thought. He wished he knew how 
the other expeditions had failed. 
It would make his job much 
easier. 

A MAN lurched past them on 
two incredibly stiff legs. 
Rigidity was evident in his every 
move. Without looking, he hur- 
ried past. 

“I know,” Ger said, after the 
creature had moved away. ‘Til 
disguise myself as a Man, walk 
through the gate to the reactor 
room, and activate my Dis- 
placer,” 

“You can’t speak their lan- 
guage,” Pid pointed out. 

“I won’t speak at all. I’ll ignore 
them. Look.” Quickly Ger shaped 
himself into a Man. 

“That’s not bad,” Pid said. 

Ger tried a few practice steps, 
copying the bumpy walk of the 
Man. 

“But I’m afraid it won’t work,” 
Pid said. 

“It's perfectly logical,” Ger 
pointed out. 

“I know. Therefore the other 



expeditions must have tried it. 
And none of them came back.” 

There was no arguing that, Ger 
flowed back into the shape of 
a log. “What, then?” he asked. 

“Let me think,” Pid said. 

Another creature lurched past, 
on four legs instead of two. Pid 
recognized it as a Dog, a pet of 
Man. He watched it carefully. 

The Dog ambled to the gate, 
head down, in no particular 
hurry. It walked through, un- 
challenged, and lay down in the 
grass. 

“H’m,” Pid said. 

They watched. One of the Men 
walked past, and touched the 
Dog on the head. The Dog stuck 
out its tongue and rolled over on 
its side. 

“I can do that,” Ger said ex- 
citedly. He started to flow into 
the shape of a Dog. 

“No, wait,” Pid said. “We’ll 
spend the rest of the day think- 
ing it over. This is too important 
to rush into.” 

Ger subsided sulkily. 

“Come on, let’s move back,” 
Pid said. He and Ger started into 
the woods. Then he remembered 
Ilg. 

“IlgP’Vhe called softly. 

There was no answer. 

“UgJ” 

“What? Oh, yes,” an oak tree 
said, and melted into a bush. 
“Sorry. What were you saying?” 

“We’re moving back,” Pid said. 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Were you, by any chance, 
Thinking?” 

“Oh, no” Ilg assured him. 
“Just resting.” 

Pid let it go at that. There 
was too much else to worry about. 

T HEY discussed it for the rest 
of the day, hidden in the deep- 
est part of the woods. The only 
alternatives seemed to be Man 
or Dog. A Tree couldn’t walk 
past the gates, since that was not 
in the nature of trees. Nor could 
anything else, and escape notice. 

Going as a Man seemed too 
risky. They decided that Ger 
would sally out in the morning 
as a Dog. 

“Now get some sleep,” Pid said. 
Obediently his two crewmen 
flattened out, going immediately 
Shapeless. But Pid had a more 
difficult time. 

Everything looked too easy. 
Why wasn’t the atomic installa- 
tion better guarded? Certainly 
the Men must have learned some- 
thing from the expeditions they 
had captured in the past. Or had 
they killed them without asking 
any questions? 

You couldn’t tell what an alien 
would do. 

Was that open gate a trap? 
Wearily he flowed into a com- 
fortable position on the lumpy 
ground. Then he pulled himself 
together hastily. 

He had gone Shapeless! 



Comfort was not in the line of 
duty, he reminded himself, and 
firmly took a Pilot’s Shape. 

But a Pilot's Shape wasn’t 
constructed for sleeping on damp, 
bumpy ground. Pid spent a rest- 
less night, thinking of ships, and 
wishing he were flying one. 

He awoke in the morning tired 
and ill-tempered. He nudged Ger. 

“Let’s get this over with,” he 
said. 

Ger flowed gaily to his feet. 

“Come on, Ilg,” Pid said angri- 
ly, looking around. “Wake up.” 

There was no reply. 

“Ilg!” he called. 

Still there was no reply. 

“Help me look for him,” Pid 
said to Ger. “He must be around 
here somewhere ” 

Together they tested every 
bush, tree, log and shrub in the 
vicinity. But none of them was 

Ilg- 

Pid began to feel a cold panic 
run through him. What could 
have happened to the Radioman? 

“Perhaps he decided to go 
through the gate on his own,” 
Ilg suggested. 

Pid considered the possibility. 
It seemed unlikely. Ilg had never 
shown much initiative. He had 
always been content to follow 
orders. 

They waited. But midday 
came, and there was still no 
sign of Ilg. 

“We can’t wait any longer,” 



KEEP YOUR SHAPE

Pid said, and they started through 
the woods. Pid wondered if Ilg 
had tried to get through the gates 
on his own. Those quiet types 
often concealed a foolhardy 
streak. 

But there was nothing to show 
that Ilg had been successful. He 
would have to assume that the 
Radioman was dead, or captured 
by the Men. 

That left two of them to ac- 
tivate a Displacer. 

And he still didn’t know what 
had happened to the other ex- 
peditions. 

A T the edge of the woods, Ger 
turned himself into a fac- 
simile of a Dog. Pid inspected him 
carefully. 

l! A little less tail,” he said. 
Ger shortened his tail. 

“More ears,” 

Ger lengthened his ears, 

“Now even them up.” 

They became even. 

Pid inspected the finished prod- 
uct. As far as he could tell, Ger 
was perfect, from the tip of his 
tail to his wet, black nose. 

“Good luck,” Pid said. 
“Thanks.” Cautiously Ger 
moved out of the woods, walking 
in the lurching style of Dogs and 
Men. At the gate the guard called 
to him. Pid held his breath, 

Ger walked past the Man, ig- 
noring him. The Man started to 
walk over, Ger broke into a run. 



Pid shaped a pair of strong 
legs for himself, ready to dash if 
Ger was caught. 

But the guard turned back to 
his gate. Ger stopped running im- 
mediately, and strolled quietly 
toward the main door of the 
building. 

Pid dissolved his legs with a 
sigh of relief . and then tensed 

again. 

The main door was closed! 

Pid hoped the Radioman 
wouldn’t try to open it. That 
was not in the nature of Dogs. 

As he watched, another Dog 
came running toward Ger. Ger 
backed away from him. The Dog 
approached and sniffed. Ger 
sniffed back. 

Then both of them ran around 
the building. 

That was clever, Pid thought. 
There was bound to be a door 
in the rear. 

He glanced up at the afternoon 
sun. As soon as the Displacer 
was activated, the Grom armies 
would begin to pour through. By 
the time the Men recovered from 
the shock, a million or more 
Grom troops would be here, 
weapons and all. With more fol- 
lowing. 

The day passed slowly, and 
nothing happened. 

Nervously Pid watched the 
front of the plant. It shouldn’t be 
taking so long, if Ger were suc- 
cessful.

Late into the night he waited. 
Men walked in and out of the 
installation, and Dogs barked 
around the gates. But Ger did 
not appear. 

Ger had failed. Ilg was gone. 
Only he was left. 

And stiff he didn’t knQw what 
had happened. 

T> Y morning, Pid was in com- 
plete despair. He knew that 
the twenty -first Grom expedition 
to this planet was near the point 
of complete failure. Now it was 
all up to him. 

He saw that workers were ar- 
riving in great number, rushing 
through the gate9. He decided to 
take advantage of the apparent 
confusion, and started to shape 
himself into a Man. 

A Dog walked past the woods 
where he was hiding. 

“Hello,” the Dog said. 

It was Ger! 

“What happened?” Pid asked, 
with a sigh of relief. “Why were 
you so long? Couldn’t you get 
in?” 

“I don’t know,? Ger said, wag- 
ging his tail. “I didn’t try.” 

Pid was speechless. 

“I went hunting,” Ger said 
complacently. “This form is ideal 
for Hunting, you know. I went 
out the rear gate with another 
Dog.” 

“But the expedition — your 
duty — ” 



“I changed my mind,” Ger told 
him. “You know, Pilot, I never 
wanted to be a Detector.” 

“But you were born a Detec- 
tor!” 

“That’s true,” Ger said. “But it 
doesn’t help. I always wanted to 
be a Hunter.” 

Pid shook his entire body in 
annoyance. “You can’t,” he said, 
very slowly, as one would explain 
to a Gromling. “The Hunter 
shape is forbidden to you.” 

“Not here it isn’t,” Ger said, 
still wagging his tail. 

“Let's have no more of this,” 
Pid said angrily. “Get into that 
installation and set up your Dis- 
placer. I’ll try to overlook this 
heresy.” 

“No,” Ger said. “I don’t want 
the Grom here. They’d ruin it 
for the rest of us.” 

“He’s right,” a nearby oak tree 
said. 

“Ilg!” Pid gasped. “Where are 

you?” 

T> RANCHES stirred. “I’m right 
here,” Ilg said. “I’ve been 
Thinking.” 

“But — your caste — ” 

“Pilot,” Ger said sadly, “why 
don’t you wake up? Most of the 
people on Grom are miserable. 
Only custom makes us take the 
caste-shape of our ancestors.” 
“Pilot,” Ilg said, “all Grom are 
born Shapeless!” 

“And being born Shapeless, all 



KEEP YOUR SHAPE 



15 




Grom should have Freedom of 
Shape,” Ger said. 

“Exactly,” Ilg said. “But he’ll 
never understand. Now excuse 
me. I want to Think.” And the 
oak tree was silent. 

Pid laughed humorlessly. “The 
Men will kill you off,” he said. 
“Just as they killed off all the 
other expeditions.” 

“No one from Grom has been 
killed,” Ger told him. “The other 
expeditions are right here.” 

“Alive?” 

“Certainly. The Men don’t even 
know we exist. That Dog I was 
Hunting with is a Grom from 
the twelfth expedition. There are 
hundreds of us here, Pilot. We 
like it.” 

Pid tried to absorb it all. He 
had always known that the lower 
castes were lax in caste-conscious- 
ness. But this was preposterous! 

This planet’s secret menace was 
— freedom ! 

“Join us, Pilot,” Ger said. 
“We’ve got a paradise here. Do 
you know how many species there 
are on this planet? An uncount- 
able number! There’s a shape to 
suit every need!” 

Pid ignored them. Traitors! 

He’d do the job all by himself. 

So Men were unaware of the 
presence of the Grom. Getting 
near the reactor might not be so 
difficult after all. The others had 
failed in their duty because they 
were of the lower castes, weak 



and irresponsible. Even the Pilots 
among them must have been 
secretly sympathetic to the Cult 
of Shapelessness the Chief had 
mentioned, or the alien planet 
could never have swayed them. 

What shape to assume for his 
attempt? 

Pid considered. 

A Dog might be best. Evidently 
Dogs could wander pretty much 
where they wished. If something 
went wrong, Pid could change his 
shape to meet the occasion. 

“The Supreme Council will 
take care of all of you,” he 
snarled, and shaped himself into 
a small brown Dog. “I’m going to 
set up the Displacer myself.” 

He studied himself for a mo- 
ment, bared his teeth at Ger, and 
loped toward the gate. 

H E loped for about ten feet and 
stopped in utter horror. 

The smells rushed at him from 
all directions. Smells in a pro- 
fusion and variety he had never 
dreamed existed. Smells that 
were harsh, sweet, sharp, heavy, 
mysterious, overpowering. Smells 
that terrified. Alien and repulsive 
and inescapable, the odors of 
Earth struck him like a blow. 

He curled his lips and held his 
breath. He ran on for a few steps, 
and had to breathe again. He al- 
most choked. 

He tried to remold his Dog- 
nostrils to be less sensitive. It 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




didn’t work. It wouldn’t, so long 
as he kept the Dog-shape. An 
attempt to modify his metabolism 
didn’t work either. 

All this in the space of two 
or three seconds. He was rooted 
in his tracks, fighting the smells, 
wondering what to do. 

Then the noises hit him. 

They were a constant and stag- 
gering roar, through which every 
tiniest whisper of sound stood out 
dearly and distinct. Sounds upon 
sounds — more noise than he had 
ever heard before at one time in 
his life. The woods behind him 
had suddenly become a mad- 
house. 

Utterly confused, he lost con- 
trol and became Shapeless. 

He half -ran, half -flowed into a 
nearby bush. There he re-Shaped, 
obliterating the offending Dog 
ears and nostrils with vicious 
strokes of his thoughts. 

The Dog-shape was out. Abso- 
lutely. Such appalling sharpness 
of senses might be fine for a 
Hunter such as Ger — he prob- 
ably gloried in them. But an- 
other moment of such impressions 
would have driven Pid the Pilot 
mad. 

What now? He lay in the bush 
and thought about it, while grad- 
ually his mind threw off the last 
effects of the dizzying sensory 
assault. 

He looked at the gate. The 
Men standing there evidently 



hadn't noticed his fiasco. They 
were looking in another direction, 
... a Man? 

Well, it was worth a try. 

S TUDYING the Men at the 
gate, Pid carefully shaped 
himself into a facsimile — a syn- 
thesis, actually, embodying one 1 
characteristic of that, another of 
this. 

He emerged from the side of 
the bush opposite the gate, on 
his hands and knees. He sniffed 
the air, noting that the smells 
the Man-nostrils picked up 
weren’t unpleasant at all. In fact, 
some of them were decidedly 
otherwise. It had just been the 
acuity of the Dog-nostrils, the 
number of smells they had de- 
tected and the near-brilliance 
with which they had done so, 
that had shocked him. 

Also, the sounds weren’t half 
so devastating. Only relatively 
close sounds stood out All else 
was an undetailed whispering. 

Evidently, Pid thought, it had 
been a long time since Men had 
been Hunters. 

He tested his legs, standing up 
and taking a few clumsy steps. 
Thud of foot on ground. Drag 
the other leg forward in a heavy 
arc. Thud. Rocking from side to 
side, he marched back and forth 
behind the bush. His arms flapped 
as he sought balance. His head 
wobbled on its neck, until he re- 



K E E P YOUR SHAPE 



17 




membered to hold it up. Head up, 
eyes down, he missed seeing a 
small rock. His heel turned on it 
He sat down, hard. 

The ankle hurt. Pid curled his 
Man-lips and crawled back into 
the bush. 

The Man-shape was too un- 
speakably clumsy, It was offen- 
sive to plod one step at a time. 
Body held rigidly upright. Arms 
wobbling. There had been a de- 
luge of sense-impressions in the 
Dog- shape; there was dull, stiff, 
half-alive inadequacy to the 
Man-shape. 

Besides, it was dangerous, now 
that Pid thought it over, as well 
as distasteful. He couldn’t con- 
trol it properly. It wouldn’t look 
right. Someone might question 
him. There was too much about 
Men he didn’t — couldn’t — know. 
The planting of the Displacer 
was too important a thing for 
him to fumble again. Only luck 
had kept him from being seen 
during the sensory onslaught. 

The Displacer in his body 
pouch pulsed and tugged, urging 
him to be on his way toward the 
distant reactor room. 

Grimly, Pid let out the last 
breath he had taken with his 
Man-lungs, and dissolved the 
lungs. 

What shape to take? 

Again he studied the gate, the 
Men standing beside it, the build- 
ing beyond in which was the all- 



important reactor. 

A small shape was needed, A 
fast one. An unobtrusive one. 

He lay and thought. 

The bush rustled above him. 
A small brown shape had flut- 
tered down to light on a twig. It 
hopped to another twig, twitter- 
ing. Then it fluttered off in a 
flash, and was gone. 

That, Pid thought, was it. 

A SPARROW that was not a 
Sparrow rose from the bush 
a few moments later. An ob- 
server would have seen it circle 
the bush, diving, hedgehopping, 
even looping, as if practicing all 
manuevers possible to Sparrows. 

Pid tensed his shoulder mus- 
cles, inclined his wings. He 
slipped off to the right, ap- 
proached the bush at what seemed 
breakneck speed, though he knew 
this was only because of his 
small size. At the last second he 
lifted his tail. Not quite quickly 
enough. He swooped up and over 
the top of the bush, but his legs 
brushed the top leaves, his beak 
went down, and he stumbled in 
air for a few feet back -forward. 

He blinked beady eyes as if at 
a challenge. Back toward the 
bush at a fine clip, again up and 
over. This time cleanly. 

He chose a tree. Zoomed into its 
network of branches, wove a web 
of flight, working his way around 
and around the trunk, over and 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




under branches that flashed be- 
fore him, through crotches with 
no more than a feather’ s-breath 
to spare. 

At last he rested on a low 
branch, and found himself chirp- 
ing in delight. 

The tree extruded a feeler from 
the branch he sat on, and touched 
his wings and tail. 

“Interesting,” said the tree. 
“I’ll have to try that shape some 
time.” 

Hg. 

“Traitor," hissed Pid, growing 
a mouth in his chest to hiss it, 
and then he did something that 
caused Ilg to exclaim in out- 
rage, 

Pid flew out of the woods. Over 
the underbrush and across the 
open space toward the gate. 

This body would do the trick! 

This body would do anything! 

He rose, in a matter of a few 
Sparrow heartbeats, to an alti- 
tude of a hundred feet. From 
here the gate, the Men, the build- 
ing were small, sharp shapes 
against a green -brown mat. Pid 
found that he could see not only 
with unaccustomed clarity, but 
with a range of vision that aston- 
ished him. To right and to left 
he could see far into the hazy 
blue of the sky, and the higher 
he rose the farther he could see. 

He rose higher. 

The Displacer pulsed, remind- 
ing him of the job he had to do. 



TTE stiffened his wings and 
glided, regretfully putting 
aside his desires to experiment 
with this wonderful shape, at 
least for the present. After he 
planted the Displacer, he would 
go off by himself for a while and 
do it just a little more — some- 
where where Ilg and Ger would 
not see him — before the Grom 
Army arrived and the invasion 
began. 

He felt a tiny twinge of guilt, 
as he circled. It was Evil to want 
to keep this alien flying shape 
any longer than was absolutely 
necessary to the performance, of 
his duty. It was a device of the 
Shapeless One — 

But what had Ilg said? All 
Grom are bom Shapeless. It was 
true. Grom children were amor- 
phous, until old enough to be in- 
structed in the caste-shape of 
their ancestors. 

Maybe it wasn’t too great a 
sin to alter your Shape, then — 
just once in a long while. After 
all, one must be fully aware of 
the nature of Evil in order to 
meaningfully reject it. 

He had fallen lower in circling. 
The Displacer pulse had strength- 
ened. For some reason it irritated 
him. He drove higher on strong 
wings, circled again. Air rushed 
past him — a smooth, whispering 
flow, pierced by his beak, stream- 
ing invisibly past his sharp eyes, 
moving along his body in tiny

turbulences that moved his feath- 
ers against his skin. 

It occurred to him — or rather 
struck him with considerable 
force — that he was satisfying a 
longing of his Pilot Caste that 
went far deeper than Piloting. 

He drove powerfully with his 
wings, felt tonus across his back, 
shot forward and up. He thought 
of the controls of his ship. He 
imagined flowing into them, be- 
coming part of them, as he had 
so often done — and for the first 
time in his life the thought failed 
to excite him. 

No machine could compare 
with this! 

What he would give to have 
wings of his own! 

. Get from my sight, Shape- 
less One! 

The Displacer must be planted, 
activated. All Grom depended 
on him. 

He eyed the building, far be- 
low. He would pass over it. The 
Displacer would tell him which 
window to enter — which window 



was so near the reactor that he 
could do his job before the Men 
even knew he was about. 

He started to drop lower, and 
the Hawk struck. 

TT had been above him. His first 
inkling of danger was the 
sharp pain of talons in his back, 
and the stunning blow of a beak 
across his head. 

Dazed, he let his back go 
Shapeless. His body-substance 
flowed from the grasp of the tal- 
ons. He dropped a dozen feet and 
resumed Sparrow-shape, hearing 
an astonished squawk from the 
attacker. 

He banked, and looked up. The 
Hawk was eying him. 

Talons spread again. The 
sharp beak gaped. The Hawk 
swooped. 

Pid had to fight as a Bird, nat- 
urally. He was four hundred feet 
above the ground. 

So he became an impossibly 
deadly Bird. 

He grew to twice the size of the

Hawk. He grew a foot-long beak 
with a double razor’s edge. He 
grew talons like six inch scimi- 
tars. His eyes gleamed a red 
challenge. 

The Hawk broke flight, squal- 
ling in alarm. Frantically, tail 
down and widespread, it thun- 
dered its wings and came to a 
dead stop six feet from Pid. 

Looking thoughtfully at Pid, it 
allowed itself to plummet. It fell 
a hundred feet, spread its wings, 
stretched its neck and flew off so 
hastily that its wings became 
blurs. 

Pid saw no reason to pursue it. 

Then, after a moment, he did. 

He glided, keeping the Hawk 
in sight, thoughts racing, feeling 
the newness, the power, the won- 
der of Freedom of Shape. 

Freedom . 

He did not want to give it up. 

The bird-shape was wondrous. 
He would experiment with it. 
Later, he might tire of it for a 
time and assume another — a 
crawling or running shape, or 
even a swimming one. The possi- 
bilities for excitement, for adven- 
ture, for fulfilment and simple 



sensual pleasure were endless! 

Freedom of Shape was — ob- 
viously, now that you thought on 
it — the Grom birthright. And the 
caste-system was artificial — ob- 
viously. A device for political 
and priestly benefit — obviously. 

Go away. Shapeless One . 
this does not concern you. 

He rose to a thousand feet, two 
thousand, three. The Displacer’s 
pulse grew feebler and finally 
vanished. 

At four thousand feet he re- 
leased it and watched it spin 
downward, vanish into a cloud. 

Then he set out after the 
Hawk, which was- now only a dot 
on the horizon. He would find 
out how the Hawk had broken 
flight as it had — skidded on air — 
he wanted to do that too! There 
were so many things he wanted to 
learn about flying. In a week, he 
thought, he should be able to 
duplicate all the skill that mill- 
enia had evolved into Birds. Then 
his new life would really begin. 

He became a torpedo-shape 
with huge wings, and sped after 
the Hawk.

Mr. President 

By STEPHEN ARR 



He had been overwhelmingly elected . 
Messages of sympathy poured in, but 
they couldn't help . « . nothing could. 



G eorge wong stood 

pale ajid silent by the 
video screen, listening to 
the election returns, a long-stem- 
med glass of champagne clutched 
forgotten in his trembling right 
hand. 

The announcer droned on: 
latest returns from Venus, with 
half of the election districts re- 
porting, give three billion four 
hundred and ninety-six million 
votes for Wong, against one bil- 
lion, four hundred million for 



Thompson, one billion One hun- 
dred million for Micrio, and nine 
hundred million for Kau. These 
results, added to the almost com- 
plete return's from Earth and the 
first fragmentary reports from 
Mars, clearly indicate a landslide 
vote for Wong as the next Presi- 
dent of the Solar Union. The two 
billion votes from Ganymede and 
Callisto, which will be received 
early tomorrow morning, cannot 
appreciably affect the results. The 
battle for the twenty-five Vice-

Presidents is less clear. It is cer- 
tain that Thompson, Miccio, 
Kau, Singh, and DuLavier will 
all be among those elected, but 
in what order is not yet . 

Wong leaned over and snapped 
the video off. His shoulders sag- 
ged. He leaned against the con- 
sole as though too tired to move, 
a slight, narrow-shouldered man 
with a very high forehead and 
thin receding black hair. His 
large, sad, almond-shaped eyes 
and yellow-tinted skin indicated 
that there was a good deal of 
Asiatic in the mixed blood that 
flowed through his veins. 

“I’m sorry, truly sorry,” 
Michael Thompson said sympa- 
thetically, placing a friendly arm 
across the narrow shoulders of the 
successful candidate. They were 
alone in the living 'room of the 
hotel suite in New Geneva, which 
they had shared for the cam- 
paign. “The people chose well. 
After the wonderful job you did 
in organizing the colonization of 
Io and Europa, you were the logi- 
cal man. And then you do have 
the fantastic Responsibility Quo- 
tient of 9.6 out of 10. Anyway,” 
he added with a weary shrug, 
“don’t feel too bad — it looks as 
though I’ll be First Vice-Presi- 
dent.” 

A brief ghost of a smile crossed 
George Wong’s face. “We who 
are about to die salute you,” he 
said, lifting his glass in a bitter 



toast to the blank video screen. 

Thompson, the man who was 
to be First Vice-President, silent- 
ly joined him. 

“At least,” Wong sighed, put- 
ting his empty glass down on the 
video, “I don’t have a family. 
Look at poor Kau. At Miccio. 
With wives and children, how 
they must have suffered when 
they learned they had been draft- 
ed by the conventions . Well, I 
guess there’s nothing else to do 
but to go to bed and wait until 
they come for me in the morning. 
Good night, Michael.” 

“Good night, George,” Michael 
Thompson said. He turned to- 
ward his own room. “I am sorry,” 
he said again. 

W ONG had already eaten 
breakfast and was dressed 
in an inconspicuous tweed suit 
for the inauguration when the 
chimes sounded, telling him that 
they were at the door. Slowly, he 
walked to the door and opened 
it 

“Good morning, Mr. Presi- 
dent,” the man outside said 
cheerily, flashing his famous grin. 
George Wong immediately recog- 
nized A1 Grimm, the man who 
had been personal secretary to 
sixty-three Presidents. He was 
one of the vast army of civil ser- 
vants who kept the wheels of 
government turning smoothly un- 
til Presidents were able to make 



MR. PRESIDENT 



23 




the decisions that would create 
policy. 

“Good morning, Al,” George 
Wong said. “I am afraid I’ll have 
to place myself completely in 
your hands for these first few 
days. Do we go to the Executive 
Mansion for the inauguration 
now?** 

“Yes, sir. Then, after your in- 
auguration, to the office. Mes- 
sages of condolence have been 
pouring in all night, but I don’t 
think you want to bother with 
them. However, I am afraid we 
will have to bring up some of the 
problems that have arisen in the 
two weeks since President Rey- 
nolds left office.” 

“How is he?” Wong asked. “I 
knew him, you know. He taught 
at Venus University at the same 
time I did. He was a fine man.” 
“I’m afraid he’s no better,” Al 
said, shaking his head. “We’re 
doing all we can for him, but he 
won’t even speak to his wife. You 
know how difficult it is.” 

“Yes, I know,” Wong said. 
They rode downstairs in silence 
and walked to the Presidential 
Copter parked in the street in 
front of the house. A few guards 
loitered in the vicinity, but there 
were no crowds. They entered 
the plush copter, which rose 
smoothly Under its whirling 
blades and carried them over the 
city, landing finally on the lawn 
of the Executive Mansion. 



Chief Justice Herz met them, 
dressed in a blue business suit, 
and after they shook hands he 
administered the oath. 

“Do you, George Wong,” he 
asked, “swear to make every de- 
cision you are asked to make as 
President of the Solar Union for 
the benefit of the people of the 
Union and in accord with what 
you believe to be fair and just, 
fully cognizant of the fact that 
the welfare of seventy-five billion 
citizens of the Union is dependent 
on you?” 

“I do,” George Wong said, 
through a painfully dry throat 
that would barely permit the 
words to come out. 

T HEY all shook hands again. 

Then Al Grimm led the Presi- 
dent across the grassy lawn, into 
the mansion, and up to the office 
that had served over a thousand 
Presidents. Wong entered it ner- 
vously. It was a large plain room, 
severely decorated. Tentatively, 
he slid into the chair behind the 
huge steel desk, and began open- 
ing the drawers. He found them 
fully stocked with tapes, a re- 
corder, all the other necessities. 
The desk and everything else in 
the room was brand new. There 
was no trace anywhere of his 
predecessors, and he was relieved 
to find it so. The Psychology De- 
partment at work, he thought. 
“While we are moving your

effects into the living quarters, 
Mr. President/’ A1 said from the 
doorway, “I wonder if we could 
start discussing the problem of 
the Gnii . their Ambassadors 
have presented an ultimatum, 
and they demand an answer to- 
day/’ 

CJO soon, President Wong 
^ thought. Couldn’t he have 
just a few hours to get used to 
his office, to wander through the 
building, to explore the green 
garden that he could see from his 
barred window stretching out be- 
hind the mansion? 

For a second, he almost rebell- 
ed ; but even as he thought of an- 
swering no, he realized that he 
never would. The Psych Agents 
had measured his Responsibility 
Quotient at 9.6, and they didn’t 
make mistakes, 

“Of course,” he answered with 
forced enthusiasm. “Who do you 
suggest I discuss the matter 
with? For that matter, who are 
the Gnii?” 

“I have the Manager De- 
fense, the Manager of Trade, and 
the Manager of Foreign Affairs 
waiting in the anteroom. With 
your permission, I’ll call them in 
and they’ll explain the problem. 
But first, if you would sign this 
order : . it has already been ap- 
proved by President ReyHfcds 
and by all of the Managers con- 
cerned.” . 

MR, PRESIDENT 



President Wong- took the paper. 
It was an order sending a space 
platoon, 5,000 warships and 500,- 
000 men, to the system of Altair 
A, to place themselves under the 
command of the Grasvian fleet 
for an attack against the system 
of Altair D. 

The President frowned. “What’s 
the story behind this?” 

“As you know,” A1 explained 
patiently, “there is an unwritten 
agreement throughout the Galaxy 
that if any system conquers too 
many other systems, an inter- 
system police force is formed to 
cut the conqueror down. Since 
for all practical purposes, there is 
an infinity of systems in the Gal- 
axy, and as each conqueror bor- 
ders on more and more of them 
as he grows larger in three-di- 
mensional expansion, unlike the 
one-dimensional conquests that 
used to occur on the surface of 
planets, conquest of the Galaxy 
is an obvious impossibility. How- 
ever, the inhabitants of Altair D 
seem to have embarked on a poli- 
cy of reckless expansion that 
could reach us in time/’ 

“I see,” President Wong said. 
“How far away are they?” 

“It will take the platoon six- 
teen years to get to the rendez- 
vous. They will remain for ten 
years, then return. Because of 
the distance, we are not expected 
to send more than this token 
force.” 

25 




PRESIDENT Wong looked at 
the order. It had already been 
signed by President Reynolds, by 
the Managers of Defense and of 
Foreign Affairs. After all, even 
though forty-two years was a 
long period of time to chop out 
of a man’s life, only 500,000 men 
were involved, and it was the 
duty of every citizen to give his 
life for his planet if required. 

With an impatient motion, he 
rolled his thumbprint in the soft 
plastic signature space, and held 
it for a second as it hardened. 
Then he threw the order into a 
basket labeled outgoing corre- 
spondence. 

His first official duty com- 
pleted, he should have felt ex- 
hilerated; but instead, nagging 
thoughts of guilt tugged at his 
brain. 

Who were the inhabitants of 
Altair D, anyway? How did he 
know that the police action was 
just? Shouldn’t he get out the 
whole file and go over it? 

But that would take days . 
and there was the matter of the 
Gnii, whoever they were. 

The three managers entered. 
President Wong stood up and 
shook hands with them. They 
didn’t waste time on other pre- 
liminaries, but rushed straight 
into business, 

“The Gnii,” the Manager of 
Trade, a large, red-faced man 
said, “demand that we remove 



our trading planetoid from their 
system. They allege that the 
planetoid is a security risk, in 
that it could be used for remote - 
control bombing of any of their 
planets. They threaten that if we 
don’t remove it voluntarily, they 
will attack it, and their Ambas- 
sadors are here in person to take 
our reply to their ultimatum.” 

There was nothing unusual in 
that, President Wong knew. Since 
both spaceships and any other 
known means of communication 
traveled at the speed of light, it 
was now more common to send 
Ambassadors on important mis- 
sions than to send messages. 

“What do you think we should 
do?” President Wong asked the 
Manager of Trade. 

“T THINK we should tell them 
to go to hell,” the Manager 
of Trade replied, his heavy face 
turning redder. “After all, we 
have a million trading planetoids 
out in the Galaxy — if we retreat 
here, we set a dangerous prece- 
dent.” •*. 

“I see,” Wong said, frowning. 
“I don't recall any alien trading 
planetoids in our system.” 

“Of course not, Mr. President,” 
said the Manager cff Foreign Af- 
fairs a tall, lean, distinguished- 
looking gentleman with blue eyes 
and ‘•iron- gray hair. “We don’t 
permit them, for much the same 
reason that the Gnii want them 



26 



galaxy science fiction 




removed from their system. Trad- 
ing planetoids are usually only 
tolerated in backward systems. 
Apparently the Gnii no longer 
desire to be considered backward. 
I, for one, think that we would be 
making a mistake not to accede 
to their request.” 

“Oh, that’s very fine, decent, 
sporting and all that,” the Mana- 
ger of Trade said irritatedly. 
“But I have to worry about feed- 
ing this overpopulated system of 
ours, which would starve if it 
weren’t for intersystem trade — a 
significant part of which is car- 
ried on through the planetoids.” 

“Can we protect the threatened 
planetoid?” President Wong ask- 
ed the Manager of Defense, a 
short, slim black man with flam- 
ing red hair. 

The Manager of Defense con- 
sidered his reply carefully. “Not 
if they are willing to pay a ter- 
rific price to destroy it,” he said 
finally, “After all, it’s thirty - 
three years away. While we can 
send out a fleet immediately that 
would get there at the same time 
as the Ambassadors, and before 
they could mount an attack, we 
hardly could send reinforcements 
and replacements once the battle 
is joined. But from the best in- 
formation available, I think that 
a small force of twenty or twenty- 
five thousand troops should be 
able to frighten the Gnii out of 
doing anything foolish. They 



aren’t very far advanced.” 
“Thirty-three years,” Presi- 
dent Wong said frowning. “That 
means a mixed crew with facilities 
for children. I am told that 
things often go wrong on that 
type of mission.” 

The Manager of Defense nod- 
ded. “They do,” he agreed short- 
ly. “However, I have analyzed 
that problem in detail in my re- 
port.” 

President Wong sighed. “If you 
gentlemen will leave your reports 
with me, I will make my decision 
by tomorrow morning.” 

Each of the Managers gave him 
several rolls of tape. Those of the 
Manager of Trade felt by far the 
heaviest. President Wong slipped 
them into the racks in his upper 
left-hand desk drawer. 

“Ask the Gnii to come in,” he 
said to Al. 

A L pushed a button on the arm 
of his chair, and the door 
swung open. Four large spidery 
creatures entered the room, fol- 
lowed by a small bald man. 
Their round bodies were encased 
in plastic globes, in which a 
whitish translucent gas swirled. 
They walked over to the Presi- 
dent’s desk, and the leader ex- 
tended a hairy leg. 

With an effort, President Wong 
forced himself to take the leg 
with his hand and pump it up 
and down. He noticed that the 



MR. PRESIDENT 



57 




creature withdrew the leg as soon 
as it was decently possible, and 
smiled a bit as he concluded that 
their aversion was mutual. 

The Gnii stepped back and be- 
gan waving his two front legs. 

“He is asking for your reply to 
his ultimatum,” the small bald 
man interpreted. 

“Tell him I’ll give him a defin- 



ite decision tomorrow,” President 
Wong said. “Apologize for my not 
being able to reply today, and 
point out that since it will take 
him thirty-three years to get 
home, one day will not make 
much difference.” 

The bald interpreter waved his 
hands. The four Gnii went into a 
small huddle, waving their spi-

of the department heads.” 

President Wong nodded tired - 
ly. “X have the tapes. I’ll study all 
your positions tonight.” 

HpHE Manager of Trade and 
*■* the Manager of Foreign Af- 
fairs rose and left the room. The 
Manager of Defense stayed in 
his seat. 

“If you feel up to it,” A1 said, 
“the Manager of Defense would 
appreciate it if you would present 
a Presidential citation to the re- 
mains of the Third Company. 
They were involved in a police 
action in the system of Veganea, 
and their morale is shattered. As 
you know, the award is tradition- 
al, as is the speech. Here’s the 
text — all you need do is read it ” 

“All right,” President Wong 
said, taking the paper from Al’s 
hand and scanning it. There was 
only one paragraph, 

The door opened and four old 
men entered, followed by an hon- 
or guard of eight husky privates. 
They approached the desk and 
stood at attention.. President 
Wong looked up from the speech 
and felt a wave of sudden nau- 
sea. For a second, he was afraid 
that he actually was going to be 
sick. None of their old lined faces 
was complete. The worst wound- 
ed had less than half a face, and 
that discolored by purple blotch- 
es of radiation scar-tissue. He was 
blind, and the others maneuvered 



him into position before the desk. 

“For the heroic parts which 
you played in the Police Action 
against Veganea—” Wong stum- 
bled over the name, then contin- 
ued hastily — “I, the President of 
the Solar Union, hereby . , 

“Hot,” said the blind one, 
through toothless gums in a voice 
that was only a hoarse whisper. 
“Tell me, do you know where 
Veganea is? Does anyone on 
Earth know where Veganea is, or 
care? How many men, Mr. Presi- 
dent, how many men, young and 
healthy, left for that police ac- 
tion? Do you know?” His hoarse 
voice rose. “Four came back . 
but can any of you gentlemen 
tell me how many left?" 

“That’s enough,” the Manager 
of Defense said. At his signal, 
two of the honor guards gently 
took hold of the veteran’s arms 
and walked him out of the room 
along with the others. 

“I order that he not be pun- 
ished,” Wong said sharply. 

“He won't be,” the Manager of 
Defense said. “Do you take me 
for a barbarian? I had hoped, 
though, that your interest might 
change their attitude. As you can 
imagine, it’s raising hell with the 
morale of the recruits.” 

“By the way,” the President 
asked, “where is Veganea, and 
how many men did we send 
there?” 

“It’s about twenty -four years 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




iiway, near Vega. The action 
started before n\y time and I 
don’t know how many men were 
involved — probably not more than 
h few million. The Police Action 
< nded successfully, but our ships 
were in the first wave and were 
wiped out.” 

T HE President sat down weari- 
ly. His hand strayed over to 
the order he had signed that 
morning for a police action, then 
drifted aimlessly away. 

“What’s next?” he asked Al. 
He slipped a few energy pills into 
his mouth as Al consulted his 

book. 

“There’s the matter of the con- 
version bomb,” Al said. “The 
Manager of Scientific Research 
and the Manager of Defense 
would like you to make a deci- 
sion about it.” 

“The conversion bomb?” Presi- 
dent Wong said, puzzled. “I've 
never heard of it/ 

“It is highest level top secret,” 
the Manager of Defense explain- 
ed. “Instead of breaking down 
atoms and releasing some energy 
as in the standard fission weap- 
ons, it converts matter entirely 
into energy. Given the matter- 
energy equation, the energy re- 
leased by a small amount of 
matter is fantastic.” 

Al had risen and gone to the 
door. He returned with an old, 
gray-haired, stoop-shouldered 



man. The President recognized 
the famous Manager of Research. 

The Manager launched imme- 
diately into his argument without 
preliminaries. “Mr. President, 
while my department has finally 
found a way to convert matter 
directly into energy, I believe 
that any use of this process would 
be disastrous. First, there is ab- 
solutely no safeguard that could 
prevent a matter-conversion pow- 
ered machine, used for peaceful 
purposes, from being changed 
into a lethal weapon by the sim- 
plest of alterations. And as a 
weapon, the conversion bomb, un- 
like atomic bombs, could not 
only destroy planets but stars 
with their entire systems. We all 
know that the law of the Galaxy 
is to prevent its domination by 
any one system — and given the 
distances and populations in- 
volved, that domination is ob- 
viously impossible. But if we 
began to construct conversion 
bombs, and if word of it got out, 
the whole Galaxy would rise 
against us, all the way to the 
Edge.” 

“But, Mr. President,” the Man- 
ager of Defense said calmly. “We 
are not a unique people. If we 
do not produce the conversion 
bomb, you may rest assured that 
someone else will. Maybe even 
our friends, the Gnii. No system 
has ever saved itself by refusing 
to manufacture the best weapons

available to it. As for the Galaxy 
rising against us — if we have the 
conversion bomb, let them! We 
will be able to defend ourselves 
•gainst any or all of them and 
blast their suns into novae.” 
“Until they have the bomb,” 
the Manager of Scientific Re- 
search interrupted. “As you say, 
we are not a unique people.” 
“Gentlemen,” the President 
said, standing up suddenly. “I feel 
tired and dizzy. The idea of a 
bomb that can wipe out systems 
is new to me. If you will leave 
your tapes, I will study your 
arguments tonight, and we can 
resume this discussion tomor- 
row.” 

two Managers rose im- 
mediately, shook hands with 
the President, and left. They did 
not speak to each other as they 
went through the door. 

“Mr. President,” A1 said, “it’s 
seven o’clock. Will you join me 
for dinner, sir?” 

President Wong slumped back 
into his seat and stared dully at 
Al, only half noticing his friendly 
grin. “What would you do about 
the Gnii, Al, if you were in my 
place?” he asked. 

“I’m sorry, sir,” Al said, “but 
I really don’t know. Better come 
along for some dinner. You've 
had a hard day, and you have 
a harder one ahead of you to- 
morrow. We saved a number of 



difficult problems that we didn’t 
want to throw at you on your 
first day in office.” 

A ghost of a smile crept over 
the President’s face, then disap- 
peared quickly. “It’s all right, Al. 
Go ahead and eat. I think I’ll 
just stay here and go over these 
tapes.” 

As Al left, President Wong saw 
the order for the police action on 
his desk. He picked it up to call 
Al to take it with him, but his 
eyes caught the words 500,000 
men . sixteen years, and a pic* 
ture of the terribly wounded vet- 
erans flashed before his eyes. 
Really, he would have to go 
through the files and find out if 
the expedition was necessary . , . 

He opened the left-hand desk 
drawer and stared at the Gnii 
tapes, but he didn’t take any of 
them out. It seemed like too much 
of an effort. 

And then, the conversion bomb 
was so much more important. 

He closed the first drawer and 
opened the one with the Con- 
version bomb tapes. 

But the Gnii had to be an- 
swered tomorrow — the bomb 
could wait. He slammed the 
drawer shut. 

“Gnii,” he muttered to himself, 
and opened the other drawer. 

Then hq noticed that he had 
put the police action order back 
into his outgoing basket. He 
slammed the drawer with the Gnii 



MR. PRESIDENT 



33 




tapes shut again and opened the 
drawer below it and pushed the 
order inside, so that it wouldn’t 
be picked up by mistake before 
he could check on it. 

“Five hundred thousand men 
in here,” he said as he closed the 
drawer. “Going to — ” 

Where were they supposed to 
go? He couldn’t remember. He 
opened the drawer again and 
looked at the order. To Altair D. 
The name had no meaning for 
him. 

Now, let’s see . oh, yes, the 
conversion bomb tape. 

He opened the drawer to take 
out the tapes, and remembered 
that the Gnii ultimatum had to 
be answered by tomorrow. 

“Gnii, Gnu, Gnuts,” he said, 
opening a drawer. It was the 
Wrong one, and the tapes weren’t 
there. Which tapes? 

The door opened, and Presi- 
dent Wong looked up to see Al's 
smiling face peering in. 

“I was passing by, sir,” Al said, 
“and I wondered if I couldn’t 
talk you into supper — ” 

“ Get oat!" the President shout- 
ed. 

The door closed softly. 

Now where was he? . Oh, yes, 



the conversion bomb. Conversion, 
conversion, conversation, bomb, 
bomb, boom, BOOM. But that 
wasn’t it either — it was the Gnii, 
they had to be answered by to- 
morrow . w Gnii, Gnii, Gnu, 
Gnuts, now in what drawer had 
he put the gnats? And why order 
a police action against Gnats? 
Just convert every one of them 
into spiders . 

A L walked slowly down the 
hall, his grin gone, his face 
looking washed out. He turned 
into his own little office and 
snapped on the communications 
video. 

“First Vice-President Michael 
Thompson,” he said to the opera- 
tor. 

In a moment Thompson ap- 
peared on the screen. 

“Mr. First Vice-President,” Al 
said in a tired voice, “may I 
suggest that you remain in the 
Capital for the next few weeks?” 

Even though he knew that it 
was not polite, Al snapped off 
the set without waiting for a reply 
— but not before he caught the 
white and frightened look on 
Thompson’s face.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





By WILLY LEY 

IS ARTIFICIAL LIFE 
POSSIBLE? 



E ARLY this year, a young 
scientist, Stanley L. Mil- 
ler of the University of 
Chicago, made an important dis- 
covery. Like many other scientific 
discoveries, it was exciting to the 
specialist who is aware of all the 
background, but needs a consid- 
erable amount of explanation for 
a layman to realize its signifi- 
cance. 



What happened was that Mr. 
Miller tried to duplicate under 
glass the conditions which prob- 
ably prevailed on Earth some 
two thousand million years ago. 
At that time, cosmological theory 
says, Earth's atmosphere must 
have been entirely different from 
what it is now. It was an atmos- 
phere which every living thing of 
today, with the exception of cer- 
tain bacteria, would find poison- 
ous. 

When the job of imitating the 
surface of the Earth before life 
began was done, it was found 
that some chemicals had formed 
in the process. Not surprising in 
itself, except that the chemicals 
were amino acids, which are the 
building blocks of protein — and 
that is the basis of life. 

¥ ET’S sit back for a moment 
and draw a kind of book- 
keeping balance. To begin with, 
we have the undeniable fact that 
life does exist on Earth. Even half 
a century ago, it was known that, 
at some time in the past, life 
could not possibly have existed 
on Earth, for you can't have any- 
thing living on what amounted to 
a ball of lava. Therefore life on 
-'Earth must have started at some 
relatively specific time. After you 
had progressed so far in your rea- 
soning, you had the simple theo- 
retical choice of postulating that 
it originated on Earth in some 



manner from things we’d call 
“non-living,” or that interplane- 
tary and interstellar space is full 
of life spores which continuously 
fall on every planet and either 
perish or settle and multiply, if 
conditions permit them to do so. 

At a later date— over three dec- 
ades intervening — physicists be- 
gan to work out how the Earth’s 
surface must have looked after it 
had cooled, deriving a picture 
decidedly inimical to life, even 
though the excessive heat was 
gone. There would be no oxygen 
in the primeval atmosphere; that 
had all been oxidized away. There 
would be ammonia, carbon diox- 
ide, carbon monoxide, methane 
gas and water, the latter in both 
forms, vapor and liquid. There 
would be, in addition to these 
material things, energy, sunlight 
with radiations of all wave- 
lengths, from long radio waves 
down to X-rays, and probably 
electrical discharges. 

When that environment was 
produced in the laboratory, it 
yielded amino acids! 

Don’t jump to conclusions at 
this point. Amino acids are as 
far removed from a complete, 
large and complex protein mole- 
cule as a pile of bricks is from a 
finished house. And a finished 
protein molecule., is a long — 
though unknown — distance from 
a living cell. The experimenters 
did not (as things are easily ex- 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




aggerated) make a living cell 
in Chicago, but merely sub- 
stances which we now know to be 
sub-sub- assemblies of a cell. 

Nor can one extrapolate from 
here on and say hopefully: Now 
that they have succeeded in creat- 
ing the sub -sub-assembly from 
dead substances, next week (or 
month, or year) they’ll get a few 
thousand amino acid molecules 
together and make a protein 
molecule. And the 'week (or 
month, or year) after that, they’ll 
get a living cell. Even so — 

But to make my thinking clear, 
let's assume that somebody, in 
the course of reproducing prim- 
evil. Earth environment, does 
obtain a living cell. There would 
then be just two possibilities: 

1. It did happen in the way in 
which those amino acids hap- 
pened. In that case, virtually the 
whole of the secret of life would 
still need to be investigated, be- 
cause all we would know is that 
it happened (admittedly a good 
deal) and we would still have to 
find out how and why. 

2. The researcher knew all the 
factors involved before hand, in 
which case the experiment would 
only have been the proof of a 
well -formulated and presumably 
complicated theory of life. 

\VrE don’t have such a theory 
** of life. In spite of a really 
enormous amount of work per- 



formed during the last seventy or 
eighty years, we have trouble 
even defining life. At first a pure- 
ly chemical definition was tried, 
until it was realized that analyz- 
ing protoplasm was like melting 
down and analyzing a locomotive 
to see why it works. Then fol- 
lowed a long period in which not 
the chemical nature, but the 
chemical (and physical) actions 
were taken to be the main cri- 
terion. 

A favorite example was an or- 
dinary egg — or, rather, two of 
them, one fertilized and the other 
not. They were obviously alike 
chemically, yet one developed 
into a chick and the other would 
rot after a while. And 'if some- 
body objected and said that fer- 
tilization therefore must have 
introduced a chemical change, 
you could point out some rather 
incredible things researchers had 
done with eggs, if not chicken 
eggs. 

For the eggs of a sea urchin 
could be “fertilized” by brushing 
them with a medium-hard brush 
under water, or by sticking a 
needle into them — gently, of 
course. It worked with butterfly 
eggs, too. Now all this could do 
was to push some substance from 
the outer layers into the interior. 
The result was fertilization, de- 
cidedly without introducing a 
chemical change of the whole. 

Well, all right, in which way 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

did a living thing act differently 
from a dead substance? First of 
all, it would eat and grow, by 
taking in substance from outside 
its body. Crystals also grow, but 
they have to be in a solution of 
the same chemical substance, 
while a living cell could digest 
and “assimilate” different sub- 
stances. At the time, some phil- 
osophers objected that this was 
true not only of living beings. A 
candle flame “assimilated” the 
wax. 'That flames could grow and 
multiply and that they -would 
leave behind the “indigestible” 
things which could not be as- 
similated, or only partly assimi- 
lated, did not need any special 
and elaborate proof. At a later 
date, chemists came up with 
the so-called autocatalytic com- 
pounds, substances which can 
also be said to “assimilate” other 
compounds. 

So the definition by “action,” 
even if well meant, could not 
be phrased sharply enough to be 
fully acceptable. A much more 
recent definition also works with 
“action” and has been condensed 
as follows : 

A slab of beef is protein. A live 
animal is, too. Put them both on 
a board and tilt it. The steak 
will follow the laws of gravity; 
the live animal will fight back. 
Of course it may not succeed, 
but it will try. 

Y ou will have noticed that this 



discussion has wandered far 
afield, from what amounted to 
attempts to find a chemical 
formula for life, to the “intent” 
of fighting gravity. But this is 
merely an indication of the fact 
that we are dealing with a very 
complex problem which can be 
approached from many angles 
and somehow eludes a fine sharp 
definition. 

TN the foregoing, a number of 
parallels have been men- 
tioned. A crystal will grow like 
a living cell, but only if it has 
the chemicals which constitute 
it to feed on. An autocatalyst can 
go a step further. And a flame — 
a purely chemical process and a 
very simple one at that — not only 
seems to assimilate, but also to 
propagate. 

Granted that the example of 
the flame is a superficial simi- 
larity, don’t the other two in- 
dicate that there is no hard and 
fast borderline between living and 
non-living things? And didn’t 
Dr. Wendell M. Stanley of the 
Rockefeller Institute for Medical 
Research in Princeton jump 
across this line one and a half 
decades ago when he succeeded 
in crystallizing a virus (the virus 
which produces the so-called 
mosaic disease of the tobacco 
plant) without killing it? 

For those who did not read 
about it at that time, I’ll briefly 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




explain that the crystals, to all 
intents and purposes, appeared 
to be as “dead” as beach sand or 
ground glass. Yet when they were 
put on the leaf of a tobacco 
plant, they caused the mosaic 
disease as if they had been sub- 
jected to no change of form. 

Naturally the conclusion was 
drawn that not only the tobacco 
mosaic virus, but any virus be- 
longed in that border area be- 
tween living and dead matter. 
Since then, we have learned one 
very important fact about viruses. 
Besides differing from bacteria 
in being much smaller, they are 
also much more specialized in 
their demands. A bacterium can 
force its way into the cells of a 
bigger host and live there, or it 
can live outside a cell. A virus 
needs the environment of a liv- 
ing cell; in that, it is reminiscent 
of the crystals which can grow 
only in a very specific environ- 
ment. 

Now the question is: Is a virus 
actually such a borderline case 
which has not progressed all the 
way to the adaptability of truly 
living matter? Or is a virus a 
degenerated parasite which — like 
far larger and far more complex 
parasites high up in the ladder of 
evolution — has lost most of the 
adaptability it once possessed for 
the sake of the apparently easy 
life of a parasite? 

Personally, I feel inclined to 



suspect the latter. But either ex- 
planation may be correct. I don't 
think anybody really knows yet. 

That, unfortunately, is the note 
on which this little dissertation 
has to end. When it comes to 
questions like the suspected 
border area between living and 
non-living matter, our knowledge 
is simply insufficient to pass 
judgment. 

And the Chicago experiment? 

It has done two things. It has 
strengthened the supposition that 
life could originate on Earth 
after the planet cooled. It has 
opened up a new avenue of re- 
search which looks promising. 

In time, the dramatic experi- 
ment might lead us to an under- 
standing of what life really is. 
And after we have succeeded in 
understanding, the creation of 
artificial life would probably be 
a process of extension — protein 
molecule, cell, linked cells, and 
so forth, perhaps all the way up 
to synthetic human beings, the 
“androids” of science fiction. But 
the creating of amino acids is 
only the beginning of that long 
climb, analogous to Franklin’s 
kite to attract lightning and the 
awesome complexity of modem 
electrical generation, power trans- 
mission and consumption. 

The experiment shows us that 
it apparently can be done. If 
artificial life is created, however, 
it would just be the confirmation

of a theory that had been worked 
out beforehand. 

As you can see, we need the 
theory first Only after we have 
that can anybody state whether 
artificial life is a definite like- 
lihood. Until then, it remains a 
theoretical possibility, though a 
good one, I believe. 

THE TROJAN PLANETS 

IS a result of a recent story 
involving the Trojan planets, 
several readers inquire what they 
are and whether they exist, and 
another wants to know if there is 
a minor planet named Agamem- 
non and where it is located. 

The story of the Trojan plan- 
ets began either in 1908 or in 
1772, depending on your point 
of view. On February 22, 1908, 
Prof. Max Wolf discovered a 
minor planet in a place in the 
sky where none of the known 
minor planets (or planetoids) 
could be that night. Of course it 
might also be a new comet, so 
it was provisionally and non- 
committally labeled TC. Ob- 
servations of TG over a period of 
time made it likely that it was 
not a comet and the observations 
were mailed to Dr. Berberich in 
Berlin, head of the special com- 
puting section for minor planets. 
It turned out to be planetoid No. 
588 and Dr. Berberich announced 
that it appeared to move in the 



orbit of mighty Jupiter. 

The brightness of No. 588 
seemed to indicate that it was 
fairly large for a planetoid, with 
an estimated diameter of 150 
miles. The discoverer then named 
it Achilles and the next problem 
was to find out whether it was 
actually in the orbit of Jupiter. 
It was Prof. Charlier of Lund 




Observatory who was the first .to 
notice that the position of Achilles 
was some 55^ degrees ahead of 
Jupiter in its orbit. 

That such a thing was possible 
at all had been predicted quite 
some time earlier, when Joseph 
Louis Lagrange had published 
an essay on “Three Bodies” in 
space and how they would move 
under the mutual gravitational 
attraction. That had been in 1772 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and Lagrange had found mathe- 
matically that three bodies could 
form a stable system if they were 
arranged in the three comers of 
an equilateral triangle. The tri- 
angle, in this case, consisted of 
the Sun, Jupiter and Achilles. 

During the same year, planet- 
oid No. 617 was found and 
named Patroclus. It also formed 
an equilateral triangle with the 
Sun and with Jupiter, but in the 
other direction, since Patroclus 
trailed Jupiter in its orbit. And 
then it turned out that another 
new discovery. No. 624 (named 
Hector), was close to Achilles. 
Further observation showed that 
Achilles and Patroclus were mem- 
bers of small clusters of planet- 
oids, one group moving ahead of 
Jupiter and one behind it. They 
were all named after heroes of 
the Trojan War, hence the gen- 
eral appellation of Trojan plan- 
ets. 

The trailing group comprises 
seven known planetoids. The 
leading group has five well-estab- 
lished members, to which the 
Germans have tentatively added 
three that, for the moment, do 
not yet bear classical names. 

Since they are moving in this 
formation, the same set of figures 
applies to every one of them. 
They all move with an orbital 
velocity of 8.1 miles per second, 
need 1 1 .86 years to go around the 
Sun once, and their average dis- 



tance is 483 million miles. That 
is the distance of each grpup from 
the Sun and of each group from 
Jupiter and, of course, the dis- 
tance of Jupiter from the Sun. 

Because this is also a consider- 
able distance from us, it is ob- 
vious that each group must have 
many more members than have 
been named, for at that distance 
we can find only comparatively 
large bodies. It is very likely that 
small ones, say a mile in diam- 
eter, move around in these clus- 
ters. A good deal of space debris 
i^ likely to be present, too. 

The motions inside these clus- 
ters must be very interesting, but 
we know comparatively little 
about them. We don't actually 
have to go there to find out. This 
is one of the astronomical prob- 
lems that could be solved by 
photographic observation from a 
space station. 

At any event, the Trojan plan- 
ets are as intriguing— though 
lacking the popular appeal — as 
the canals of Mars. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

What are the oldest known 
fossils and how old are they?

First let’s get the chronology 
straight so that lack of ex- 
planation does not lead to mis- 
understandings.

Prior to our own era, we 
had the Cenozoic Era, also 
called the Tertiary Period or 
the Age of Mammals, with a 
total duration of about 60 mil- 
lion years. Before that came 
the Mesozoic Era, also called 
the Age of Reptiles, with a total 
duration of about 135 million 
years, and, prior to that, the 
Paleozic Era with a total dura- 
tion of 355 million yearg. Be- 
fore that — still going backward 
— there was the Proterozoic 
Era and, before that, the Arche- 
ozoic Era, each estimated to 
have been 650 million yearg in 
duration. 

For quite a number of years 
(but algo quite a number of 
years ago), students were 
taught that a fossil from the 
Archeozoic was known — hemi- 
spherical masses, from a few 
inches to a few feet in diameter. 
The name given was Eosoon 
canadense, but although this 
means “the dawn animal from 
Canada,” it was stated that they 
had probably been colonies of 
algae. But it is now believed 
that Eozoon is not a fossil at 
all. From the Proterozoic Era, 
a few doubtful fossils are 
known, one from Australia 
(Protaledadia) and one from 
the Grand Canyon (Beltina 
danae )■> both believed to be 
early arthropods. 

“Arthropods,” in case any- 



body stumbles over the word, 
is the summary designation of 
crustaceans, insects, gpiderg, 
scorpions, centipedes and milli- 
pedes. Spicules of sponges 
from the Proterozoic of Grand 
Canyon are less doubtful than 
the supposed early arthropods, 
and the trails of an otherwise 
unknown wormlike animal 
from the Proterozoic of Glacier 
National Park are accepted. 

The reason for the extreme 
scarcity of fossils from the first 
two Eras is twofold: One is the 
extreme age of thege periods 
and the other is that most very 
primitive animals and plants 
do not have solid shells, hones 
or other structures which can 
fossilize. 

With the first period (the 
Cambrian Period) of the Paleo- 
zoic Era, fossils become fre- 
quent. 

I have had some difficulty un- 
derstanding what nebulae actu- 
ally are. Are they composed of 
stars, cosmic dust or what? In 
connection with nebulae, I have 
heard the terms “ planetary " 
“ diffuse?' “dark” “galactic" and 
“ spiral ” What do these terms 
mean? 

' Jarrell Fontenote 

1014 Npches Drive 
Port Neches, Texas 

Yes, the terminology is some- 
what confusing. 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




In Latin, the word nebula 
means “vapor” or “smoke” 
and nebulosity means “cloud- 
ed.” This word was chosen be- 
cause the appearance of some 
nebulae suggests vapor or 
clouds. All nebulae are group- 
ed as either “galactic” or “ex- 
tragalactic,” the former belong 
to our own galaxy while the 
extragalactic nebulae are other 
galaxies. 

The galactic nebulae are of 
three types: dark, diffuse and 
planetary. 

Dark nebulae bear that name 
because they show up dark 
against a background of stars, 
many of which they obscure. 

Diffuse nebulae are of ir- 
regular outline and shape and 
are probably visible only be- 
cause of the light of nearby 
stars which they reflect. 

These two types, which might 
be essentially the same under 
different illumination, consist 
of gas molecules and dust par- 
ticles. 

The planetary nebulae have 
the most misleading name. 
They were originally called that 
because in the telescope they 
show a disk like a planet, while 
the stars show as points. They 
are the gaseous envelopes of 
certain stars, round or nearly 
round in shape and sharply 
defined. 

The extragalactic nebulae are 



subdivided into two types, el- 
liptical and spiral. The spirals 
are then subdivided once more 
into “normal spirals” and “bar- 
red spirals” and in each of 
the two spiral types, astrono- 
mers distinguish “early,” “in- 
termediate” and “late” forms. 
Since the elliptical extragalac- 
tics as well as the spirals are 
galaxies like our own, generally 
speaking, their light is due to 
the stars which compose them. 

To round off the survey, I 
have to add that a number of 
“irregular” extragalactic nebu- 
lae are known and that there 
are many Q-type extragalactic 
nebulae. Q-type means too faint 
to be classified properly.

months out of the Academy. It 
was a wonderful day. 

The Commandant told Beau- 
claire to sit down, and sat look- 
ing at him for a long while. The 
Commandant Was an old man 
with a face of many lines. He 
was old, was hot, was tired. He 
was also very irritated. He had 
reached that point of oldness 
when talking to a young man is 
an irritation because they are so 
bright and certain and don’t know 
anything and there is nothing 
you can do about it. 

“All right,” the Commandant 
said, “there are a few things I 
have to tell you. Do you know 
where you are going?” 

“No. sir,” Beauclaire said 
cheerfully. 

“All right,” the Commandant 
said again, “I’ll tell you. You 
are going to the Hole in Cygnus. 
You’ve heard of it, I hope? Good. 
Then you know that the Hole 
is a large dust cloud — estimated 
diameter, ten light-years. We 
have never gone into the Hole, 
for a number of reasons. It’s too 
thick for light speeds, it's too 
big, and Mapping Command 
ships are being spread thin. Also, 
until now, we never thought there 
was anything in the Hole worth 
looking at. So we have never gone 
into the Hole. Your ship will 
be the first.” 

“Yes, sir,” Beauclaire said, eyes 
shining. 



“A few weeks ago,” the Com- 
mandant said, “one of our ama- 
teurs had a lens on the Hole, 
just looking. He saw a glow. He 
reported to us; we checked and 
saw the same thing. There is a 
faint light coming out of the Hole 
-—obviously, a sun, a star inside 
the cloud, just far enough in to 
be almost invisible. God knows 
how long it’s been there, but we 
do know that there’s never been 
a record of a light in the Hole. 
Apparently this star orbited in 
some time ago, and is now on its 
way out. It is just approaching 
the edge of the cloud. Do you 
follow me?” 

“Yes, sir,” Beauclaire said. 

“Your job is this: You will 
investigate that sun for livable 
planets and alien life. If you 
find anything — which is highly 
unlikely — you are to decipher the 
language and come right back. A 
Psych team will go out and de- 
termine the effects of a starless 
sky upon the alien culture — ob- 
viously, these people will never 
have seen the stars.” 

riYHE Commandant leaned for- 
ward, intent now for the first 
time. 

“Now, this is an important job. 
There were no other linguists 
available, so we' passed over a 
lot of good men to pick you. 
Make no mistake about your 
qualifications. You are nothing

spectacular. But the ship will be 
yours from now on, permanently. 
Have you got that?” 

The young man nodded, grin- 
ning from ear to ear. 

“There is something else,” the 
Commandant said, and abruptly 
he paused. 

He gazed silently at Beauclaire 
—at the crisp gray uniform, the 
baby-slick cheek — and he thought 
fleetingly and bitterly of the Hole 
in Cygnus which he, an old man, 
would never see. Then he told 
himself sternly to leave off self- 
pity. The important thing was 
coming up, and he would have to 
say it well. • 

"Listen,” he said. The tone of 
his voice was very strong and 
Beauclaire blinked. “You are re- 
placing one of our oldest men. 
One of our best men. His name 
is Billy Wyatt. He — he has been 
with us a long time.” The Com- 
mandant paused again, his fingers 
toying with the blotter on his 
desk. “They have told you a lot 
of stuff at the Academy, which 
is all very important. But I want 
you to understand something 
else: This Mapping Command is 
a weary business — few men last 
for any length of time, and those 
that do aren’t much good in the 
end. You know that. Well, I want 
you to be very careful when you 
talk to Billy Wyatt; and I want 
you to listen to him, because he’s 
been around longer than any- 



body. We’re relieving him, yes, 
because he is breaking down. He’s 
no good for us any more; he 
has no more nerve. He’s lost the 
feeling a man has to have to do 
his job right.” 

The Commandant got up slow- 
ly and walked around in front of 
Beauclaire, looking into his eyes. 

“When you relieve Wyatt, treat 
him with respect. He’s been far- 
ther and seen more than any man 
you will ever meet. I want no 
cracks and no pity for that man. 
Because, listen, boy, sooner or 
later the same thing will happen 
to you. Why? Because it’s too 
big — ” the Commandant gestured 
helplessly with spread hands — 
“it’s all just too damn big. Space 
is never so big that it can’t get 
bigger. If you fly long enough, 
it will finally get too big to make 
any sense, and you’ll start think- 
ing. You’ll start thinking that it 
doesn’t make sense. On that day, 
we’ll bring you back and put you 
into an office somewhere. If we 
leave you alone, you lose ships 
and get good men killed — there’s 
nothing we can do when space 
gets too big. That is what hap- 
pened to Wyatt. That is what 
will happen, eventually, to you. 
Do you understand?” 

The young man nodded uncer- 
tainly. 

“And that,” the Commandant 
said sadly, “is the lesson for 
today. Take your ship. Wyatt

will go with you on this one trip, 
to break you in. Pay attention to 
what he has to say — it will mean 
something. There’s one other 
crewman, a man named Cooper. 
You’ll be flying with him now. 
Keep your ears open and your 
mouth shut, except for questions. 
And don’t take any chances. 
That’s all." 

Beauclaire saluted and rose to 

go. 

“When you see Wyatt,’’ the 
Commandant said, “tell him I 
won’t be able to make it down 
before you leave. Too busy. Got 
papers to sign, Got more damn 
papers than the chief has ulcers.” 

The young man waited. 

“That, .God help you, is all,” 
said the Commandant. 

TOT Y ATT saw the letter when 
the young man was still a 
long way off. The white caught 
his eye, and he watched idly for 
a moment. And then he saw the 
fresh green gear on the man’s 
back and the look on his face as 
he came up the ladder, and Wyatt 
stopped breathing. 

He stood for a moment blink- 
ing in the sun. Me? he thought 
. me? 

Beauclaire reached the plat- 
form and threw down his gear, 
thinking that this was One hell 
of a way to begin a career. 

Wyatt nodded to him, but 
didn’t say anything. He accepted 



the letter, opened it and read it. 
He was a short man, thick and 
dark and very powerful. The 
lines of his face did not change 
as he read the letter. 

“Well,” he said when he was 
done, “thank you.” 

There was a long wait, and 
Wyatt said at last : “Is the Com- 
mandant coming down?” 

“No, sir. He said he was tied 
up. He said to give you his best.” 
“That’s nice,” Wyatt said. 
After that, neither of them 
spoke. Wyatt showed the new 
man to his room and wished him 
good luck. Then he went back 
to his cabin and sat down to 
think. 

After 28 years in the Mapping 
Command, he had become neces- 
sarily immune to surprise; he 
could understand this at once, but 
it would ^)e some time before he 
would react. Weil, well, he said 
to himself; but he did not feel it. 

Vaguely, flicking cigarettes onto 
the floor, he wondered why. The 
letter had not given a reason. He 
had probably flunked a physical. 
Or a mental. One or the other, 
each good enough reason. He 
was 47 years old, and this was a 
rough business. Still, he felt 
strong and cautious, and he knew 
he was not afraid. He felt good 
for a long while yet . but ob- 
viously he was not. 

Well, then f he thought, where 
now ? 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




He considered that with inter- 
est. There was no particular place 
for him to go. Really no place. 
He had come into the business 
easily and naturally, knowing 
what he wanted — which was 
simply to move and listen and 
see. When he was young, it had 
been adventure alone that drew 
him; now it was something else 
he could not define, but a thing 
he knew he needed badly. He had 
to see, to watch . and under- 
stand. 

It was ending, the long time 
was ending. It didn’t matter 
what was wrong with him. The 
point was that he was through. 
The point was that he was going 
home, to nowhere in particular. 

When evening came, he was 
still in his room. Eventually he’d 
been able to accept it all and 
examine it clearly, and had de- 
cided that there was nothing to 
do. If there was anything out in 
space which he had not yet 
found, he would not be likely to 
need it. 

He left off sitting, and went up 
to the contrbl room. 

C OOPER was waiting for him. 

Cooper was a tall, bearded, 
scrawny man with a great temper 
and a great heart and a small 
capacity for liquor. He was sit- 
ting all alone in the room when 
Wyatt entered. 

Except for the pearl-green glow 



of dashlights from the panel, the 
room was dark. Cooper was lying 
far back in the pilot’s seat, his 
feet propped up on the panel. 
One shoe was off, and he was 
carefully pressing buttons with 
his huge bare toes. The first thing 
Wyatt saw when he entered was 
the foot glowing luridly in the 
green light of the panel. Deep 
within the ship he could hear the 
hum of the dynamos starting and 
stopping. 

Wyatt grinned. From the play 
of Coop’s toes, and the attitude, 
and the limp, forgotten pole of 
an arm which hung down loosely 
from the chair, it was obvious 
that Coop was drunk. In port, 
he was usually drunk. He was a 
lean, likable man with very few 
cares and no manners at all, 
which was typical of men in that 
Command. 

“What say, Billy?’' Coop mum- 
bled from deep in the seat. 

Wyatt sat down. “Where you 
been?” 

“In the port. Been drinkin’ in 
the goddam port. Hot!" 

“Bring back any?” 

Coop waved an arm floppUy 
in no particular direction. “Look 
around.” 

The flasks lay in a heap by 
the door. Wyatt took one and 
sat down again. The room was 
warm and green and silent. The 
two men had been together long 
enough to be able to sit without

speaking, and in the green glow 
they waited, thinking. The first 
pull Wyatt took was long and 
numbing; he closed his eyes. 

Coop did not move at all. Not 
even his toes. When Wyatt had 
begun to think he was asleep, he 
said suddenly: 

“Heard about the replace- 
ment.” 

Wyatt looked at him. 

“Found out this afternoon,” 
Coop said, “from the goddam 
Commandant.” 

Wyatt closed his eyes again. 

“Where you goin’?” Coop 
asked. 

Wyatt shrugged. “Plush job.” 

“You got any plans?” 

Wyatt shook his head. 

Coop swore moodily. “Never 
let you alone,” he muttered. 
“Miserable bastards.” He rose up 
suddenly in the chair, pointing a 
long matchstick finger into 
Wyatt’s face. “Listen, Billy,” he 
said with determination, “you 
was a good man, you know that? 
You was one hell of a good god- 
dam man.” 

Wyatt took another long pull 
and nodded, smiling. 

“You said it,” he said. 

“I sailed with some good men, 
some good men,” Coop insisted, 
stabbing shakily but emphatically 
with his finger, “but you don’t 
take nothin’ from nobody.” 

“Here’s to me, I’m true blue,” 
Wyatt grinned.

/'"’OOP sank back in the chair, 
^ satisfied. “I just wanted you 
should know. You been a good 
man.” 

“Betcher sweet life,” Wyatt 
said. 

“So they throw you out. Me 
they keep. You they throw out. 
They got no brains.” 

Wyatt lay back, letting the 
liquor take hold, receding with- 
out pain into a quiet world. The 
ship was good to feel around 
him, dark and throbbing like a 
living womb. Just like a womb, 
he thought. If s a lot like a womb. 

“Listen,” Coop said thickly, 
rising from his chair. “I think 
I’ll quit this racket. What the 
hell I wanna stay in this racket 
for?” 

Wyatt looked up, startled. 
When Coop was drunk, he was 
never a little drunk. He was 
always far gone, and he could 
be very mean. Wyatt saw now 
that he was down deep and 
sinking; that the replacement was 
a big thing to him, bigger than 
Wyatt had expected. In this 
team, Wyatt had been the leader, 
and it had seldom occurred to 
him that Coop really needed him. 
He had never really thought 
about it. But now he let himself 
realize that, alone, Coop could 
be very bad. Unless this new 
man was worth anything and 
learned quickly, Coop would 
very likely get himself killed. 



Now, more than ever, this re- 
placement thing was ridiculous; 
but for Coop’s sake, Wyatt said 
quickly: 

“Drop that, man. You’ll be on 
this ship in the boneyard. You 
even look like this ship — you got 
a bright red bow.” 

When the tall man was dark 
and silent, Wyatt said gently, 
“Coop. Easy. We leave at mid- 
night. Want me to take her up?” 
“Naw.” Coop turned away 
abruptly, shaking his head. 
“T’hell with you. Go die.” He 
sank back deeply in the seat, his 
gaunt face reflecting the green 
glow from the panel. His next 
words were sad, and, to Wyatt, 
very touching. 

“Hell, Billy,” Coop said weari- 
ly, “this ain’ no fun.” 

Wyatt let him take the ship up 
alone. There was no reason to 
argue about it. Coop was drunk; 
his mind was unreachable. 

At midnight, the ship bucked 
and heaved and leaped up into 
the sky. Wyatt hung tenuously 
to a stanchion by a port, watched 
the night lights recede and the 
stars begin blooming. In a few 
moments the last clouds were 
past, and they were out in the 
long night, and the million mil- 
lion speckled points of glittering 
blue and red and silver burned 
once more with the mighty light 
which was, to Wyatt, all that was 
real or had ever meant living. In

the great glare and the black he 
stood, as always, waiting for 
something to happen, for the huge 
lonely beauty to resolve itself to 
a pattern and descend and be un- 
derstood. 

It did not. It was just space, 
an area in Which things existed, 
in which mechanized substance 
moved. Wondering, waiting, Wy- 
att regarded the Universe. The 
stars looked icily back. 

At last, almost completely 
broken, Wyatt- went to bed. 

TJEAUCLAIRE’S first days 
passed very quickly. He spent 
them in combing the ship, seeking 
her out in her deepest layers, 
watching and touching and lov- 
ing. The ship was to him like a 
woman; the first few days were 
his honeymoon. Because there is 
no lonelier job that a man &an 
have, it was nearly always this 
way with men in the Command. 

Wyatt and Cooper left him 
pretty much alone. They did not 
come looking for him, and the 
few times that he did see them 
he could not help but feel their 
surprise and resentment. Wyatt 
was always polite. Cooper was 
not. Neither seemed to have any- 
thing to say to Beauclaire, and 
he was wise enough to stay by 
himself. Most of Beauclaire’s life 
until now had been spent among 
books and dust and dead, ancient 
languages. He was by nature a 



solitary man, and therefore it was 
not difficult for him to be alone. 

On a morning some weeks after 
the trip began, Wyatt came look- 
ing for him. His eyes twinkling, 
Wyatt fished him up, grease- 
coated and embarrassed, out of a 
shaft between the main dynamos. 
Together they went up toward 
the astrogation dome. And under 
the great dome, beneath the mas- 
sive crystal sheet on the other 
side of which there was nothing 
for ever and ever, Beauclaire saw 
a beauty which he was to remem- 
ber as long as he lived. 

They were nearing the Hole in 
Cygnus. On the side which faces 
the center of the Galaxy the Hole 
is almost flat, from top to bottom, 
like a wall. They were moving 
in on the flat side now, floating 
along some distance from the 
wall, which was so huge and in- 
credible that Beauclaire was 
struck dumb. 

It began above him, light-years 
high. It came down in a black, 
folding, rushing silence, fell away 
beneath him for millions upon 
millions of miles, passed down be- 
yond sight so far away, so un- 
believably far away and so vast, 
that there could be nothing as 
big as this, and if he had not 
seen the stars still blazing on 
either side he would have had to 
believe that the wall was just out- 
side the glass, so close he could 
touch it. From all over the wall

a haze reflected faintly, so that 
the wall stood out in ridges and 
folds from the great black of 
space. Beauclaire looked up and 
then down, and then stood and 
gazed. 

After a while, Wyatt pointed 
silently down. Beauclaire looked 
in among the folds and saw it, the 
tiny yellow gleam toward which 
they were moving. It was so small 
against the massive cloud that 
he lost it easily. 

Each time he took his eyes 
away, he lost it, and had to 
search for it again. 

“It’s not too far in,” Wyatt 
said at last, breaking the silence. 
“We'll move down the cloud to 
the nearest point, then we’ll slow 
down and move in. Should take a 
couple of days.” 

Beauclaire nodded. 

“Thought you’d like to see,” 
Wyatt said. 

“Thanks.” Beauclaire was sih- 
cerely grateful. And then, unable 
to contain himself, he shook his 
head with wonder. “My God he 
said. 

Wyatt smiled. “It’s a big 
show.” 

Later, much later, Beauclaire 
began to remember what the 
Commandant had said about 
Wyatt. But he could not under- 
stand it at all. Siire, something 
like the Hole was incomprehen- 
sible. It did not make any sense — 
but so what? A thing as beautiful 



as that, Beauclaire thought, did 
not have to make sense. 

HPHEY reached the sun slowly. 

The gas was not thick by any 
Earthly standards — approximate- 
ly one atom to every cubic mile 
of space — -but for a starship, any 
matter at all is too much. At 
normal speeds, the ship would 
hit the gas like a wall. So they 
came in slowly, swung in and 
around the large yellow sun. 

They saw one planet almost 
immediately. While moving in to- 
ward that one they scanned for 
others, found none at all. 

Space around them was abso- 
lutely strange; there was nothing 
in the sky but a faint haze. They 
were in the cloud now, and of 
course could see no star. There 
was nothing but the huge sun and 
the green gleaming dot of that 
one planet, and the endless haze. 

From a good distance out, Wy- 
att and Cooper ran through the 
standard tests while Beauclaire 
watched with grave delight. They 
checked for radio signals, found 
none. The spectrum of the planet 
revealed strong oxygen and water - 
vapor lines, surprisingly little 
nitrogen. The temperature, while 
somewhat cool, was in the livable 
range. 

It was a habitable planet. 

“Jackpot!” Coop said cheer- 
fully. “All that oxygen, bound to 
be some kind of life.”

Wyatt said nothing. He was 
sitting in the pilot chair, his huge 
hands on the controls, nursing 
the ship around into the long 
slow spiral which would take 
them down. He was thinking of 
many other things, many other 
landings. He was remembering 
the acid ocean at Lupus and the 
rotting disease of Altair, all the 
dark, vicious, unknowable things 
he had approached, unsuspecting, 
down the years. 

... So many years, that now 
he suddenly realized it was too 
long, too long. 

Cooper, grinning unconsciously 
as he scanned with the telescope, 
did not notice Wyatt’s sudden 
freeze. 

It was over all at once.. Wyatt’s 
knuckles had gradually whitened 
as he gripped the panel. Sweat 
had formed on his face and run 
down into his eyes, and he blink- 
ed, and realized with a strange 
numbness that he was soaking 
wet all over. In that moment, 
his hands froze and gripped the 
panel, and he could not move 
them. 

It was a hell of a thing to hap- 
pen on a man’s last trip, he 
thought. He would like to have 
taken her down just this once. 
He sat looking at his hands. 
Gradually, calmly, carefully, with 
a cold will and a welling sad- 
ness, he broke his hands away 
from the panel. 



"Coop,” he said, “take over.” 

Coop glanced over and saw. 
Wyatt’s face was white and 
glistening; his hands in front of 
him were wooden and strange. 

“Sure,” Coop said, after a very 
long moment. “Sure.” 

Wyatt backed off, and Coop 
slid into the seat. 

“They got me just in time,” 
Wyatt said, looking at his stiff, 
still fingers. He looked up and 
ran into Beau claire’s wide eyes, 
and turned away from the open 
pity. Coop was bending over the 
panel, swallowing heavily. 

“Well,” Wyatt said. He was 
beginning to cry. He walked 
slowly from the room, his hands 
held before him like old gray 
things that had died. 

rpHE ship circled automatically 
throughout the night, while 
its crew slept or tried to. In the 
morning they were all forcefully 
cheerful and began to work up an 
interest. 

There were people on the 
planet. Because the people lived 
in villages, and had no cities and 
no apparent science, Coop let the 
ship land. 

It was unreal. For a long while, 
none of them could get over the 
feeling of unreality, Wyatt least 
of all. He stayed in the ship and 
got briefly drunk, and then came 
out as carefully efficient as ever. 
Coop was gay and brittle. Only 



THE BOOK

Beauclaire saw the planet with 
any degree of clarity. And all the 
while the people looked back. 

From the very beginning it was 
peculiar. 

The people saw the ship pass- 
ing overhead, yet curiously they 
did not run. They gathered in 
groups and watched. When the 
ship landed, a small band of them 
came out of the circling woods 
and hills and ringed the ship, 
and a few came up and touched it 
calmly, ran fingers over smooth 
steel sides. 

The people were human. 

There was not, so far as Beau- 
claire could tell, a single signifi- 
cant difference. It was not really 
extraordinary — similar conditions 
will generally breed similar races 
— but there was something about 
these men and women which was 
hard and powerful, and in a way 
almost grand. 

They were magnificently built, 
rounded and bronzed. Their wo- 
men especially were remarkably 
beautiful. They were wearing 
woven clothes of various colors, 
in simple savage fashions; but 
there was nothing at all savage 
about them. They did not shout 
or seem nervous or move around 
very much, and nowhere among 
them was there any sign of a 
weapon. Furthermore, they did 
not seem to be particularly curi- 
ous. The ring abbut the ship 
did not increase. Although sev- 



eral new people wandered in from 
time to time, others were leaving, 
unconcerned. The only ones 
among them who seemed at all 
excited were the children. 

Beauclaire stood by the view- 
screen, watching. Eventually 
Coop joined him, looking without 
interest until he saw the women. 
There was one particular girl 
with shaded brown eyes and a 
body of gentle hills. Coop grinned 
widely and turned up the mag- 
nification until the screen showed 
nothing but the girl. He was gaz- 
ing with appreciation and mak- 
ing side comments to Beauclaire 
when Wyatt came in. 

“Looka that , Billy,” Coop 
roared with delight, pointing. 
“Man, we have come home!” 

YATT smiled very tightly, 
changed the magnification 
quickly to cover the whole throng 
around them. 

“No trouble?” 

“Nope,” Coop said. “Air’s 
good, too. Thin, but practically 
pure oxygen. Who’s first to go 
out?” 

"Me,” Wyatt said, for obvious 
reasons. He would not be missed. 

No one argued with him. Coop 
was smiling as Wyatt armed him- 
self. Then he warned Wyatt to 
leave that cute little brown-eyed 
doll alone. 

Wyatt went out. 

The air was clear and cool. 




56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




There was a faint breeze stirring 
the leaves around him, and Wyatt 
listened momentarily to the far 
bell-calls of birds. This would be 
the last time he would ever go 
out like this, to walk upon an 
unknown world. He waited for 
some time by the airlock before 
he went forward. 

The ring of people did not 
move as he approached, his hand 
upraised in what the Mapping 
Command had come to rely on as 
the universal gesture of peace. 
He paused before a tall, mono- 
lithic old man in a single sheath 
of green cloth. 

“Hello,” he said aloud, and 
bowed his head slowly. 

From the ship, through the 
wide-angle sights of a gun, Beau- 
claire watched breathlessly as 
Wyatt went through the panto- 
mime of greeting. 

None of the tall people moved, 
except the old man, who folded 
his arms and looked openly 
amused. When the pantomime 
was done, Wyatt bowed again. 
The old man broke into a broad 
grin, looked amiably around at 
the circle of people, and then 
quite suddenly bowed to Wyatt. 
One by one the people, grinning, 
bowed. 

Wyatt turned and waved at the 
ship, and Beauclaire stood away 
from his gun, smiling. 

It was a very fine way to be- 
gin. 



I N the morning Wyatt went out 
alone, to walk in the sun 
among the trees, and he found 
the girl he had seen from the 
ship. She was sitting alone by a 
stream, her feet cooling and 
splashing in the clear water. 

Wyatt sat down beside her. 
She looked up, unsurprised, out 
of eyes that were rich and grained 
like small pieces of beautiful 
wood. Then she bowed, from the 
waist. Wyatt grinned and bowed 
back. 

Unceremoniously he took off 
his boots and let his feet plunk 
down into the water. It was 
shockingly cold, and he whistled. 
The girl smiled at him. To his 
surprise, she began to hum softly. 
It was a pretty tune that he was 
able to follow, and after a mo- 
ment he picked up the harmony 
and hummed along with her. She 
laughed, and he laughed with her, 
feeling very young. 

Me Billy, he thought of saying, 
and laughed again. He was con- 
tent just to sit without saying 
anything. Even her body, which 
was magnificent, did not move 
him to anything but a quiet ad- 
miration, and he regarded him- 
self with wonder. 

The girl picked up one of his 
boots and examined it critically, 
clucking with interest. Her lovely 
eyes widened as she played with 
the buckle. Wyatt showed her 
how the snaps worked and she

57 




was delighted and clapped her 
hands. 

Wyatt brought other things out 
of his pockets arid she examined 
them all, one after the other. The 
picture of him on his ID card 
was the only one which seemed 
to puzzle her. She handled it and 
looked at it, and then at him, and 
shook her head- Eventually she 
frowned and gave it definitely 
1 back to him. He got the impres- 
sion that she thought it was very 
bad art He chuckled. 

The afternoon passed quickly, 
and the sun began to go down. 
They hummed some more and 
sang songs to each other which 
neither understood and both en- 
joyed, and it did not occur to 
Wyatt until much later how little 
curiosity they had felt. They did 
not speak at all. She had no in- 
terest in his language or his name, 
and, strangely, he felt all through 
the afternoon that talking was un- 
necessary. It was a very rare day 
spent between two people who 
were not curious and did not 
want anything from each other. 
The only words they said to each 
other were goodbye. 

Wyatt, lost inside himself, 
plodding, went back to the ship. 

TN the first week, Beauclaire 
spent his every waking hour 
learning the language of the 
planet. From the very beginning 
he had felt an unsettling, peculiar 



manner about these pople. Their 
behavior was decidedly unusual. 
Although they did not differ in 
any appreciable way from hu- 
man beings, they did not act 
very much like human beings in 
that they were almost wholly 
lacking a sense of awe, a sense of 
wonder. Only the children seemed 
surprised that the ship had land- 
ed, and only the children hung 
around and inspected it. Almost 
all the others went off about their 
regular business — which seemed 
to be farming — and when Beau- 
claire tried learning the language, 
he found very few of the people 
willing to spend time enough to 
teach him. 

But they were always more or 
less polite, and by making a pest 
of himself he began to succeed. 
On another day when Wyatt 
came back from the brown- eyed 
girl, Beauclaire reported some 
progress. 

“It’s a beautiful language,” he 
said as Wyatt came in- “Amaz- 
ingly well -dev eloped. It's some- 
thing like our Latin — same type 
of construction, but much softer 
and more flexible. I’ve been trying 
to read their book.” 

Wyatt sat down thoughtfully 
and lit a cigarette. 

“B x>k?” he said. 

“Yes. They have a lot of books, 
but everybody has this one par- 
ticular book — they keep it in a 
place of honor in their houses.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




i ’ve tried to ask them what it is — 
i think it’s a bible of some kind — 
hut they just won’t bother to tell 

: lie.” 

Wyatt shrugged, his mind drift- 
ing away. 

“I just don’t understand them,” 
Beauclaire said plaintively, glad 
to have someone to talk to. “I 
■ ion’t get them at all. They’re 
■luick, they’re bright, but they 
haven't the damnedest bit of curi- 
osity about anything, not even 
each other. My God, they don’t 
even gossip!” 

Wyatt, contented, puffed quiet- 
ly. “Do you think not seeing the 
stars has something to do with 
it? Ought to have slowed down 
the development of physics and 
math.” 

Beauclaire shook his head. “No. 
It’s very strange. There’s some- 
thing else. Have you noticed the 
way the ground seems to be sharp 
and jagged almost everywhere 
you look, sort of chewed up as if 
there was a war? Yet these peo- 
ple swear that they’ve never had 
a war within living memory, and 
they don’t keep any history so 
a man could really find out.” 

When Wyatt didn’t say any- 
thing, he went on: 

“And I can’t see the connection 
about no stars. Not with these 
people. I don’t care if you can’t 
see the roof of the house you live 
in, you still have to have a cer- 
tain amount of curiosity in order 



to stay alive. But these people 
just don’t give a damn. The ship 
landed. You remember that? Out 
of the sky come Gods like thun- 
der — ” 

W YATT smiled. At another 
time, at any time in the 
past, he would have been very 
much interested in this sort of 
thing. But now he was not. He 
felt himself — remote, sort of — 
and he, like these people, did not 
particularly give a damn. 

But the problem bothered 
Beauclaire, who was new and 
fresh and looking for reasons, and 
it also bothered Cooper. 

“Damn!” Coop grumbled as 
he came stalking into the room. 
“Here you are, Billy. I'm bored 
stiff. Been all over this whole 
crummy place lookin for you. 
Where you been?” He folded him- 
self into a chair, scratched his 
black hair broodingly with long, 
sharp fingers. “Game o’ cards?” 
“Not just now, Coop,” Wyatt 
said, lying back and resting. 

Coop grunted. “Nothin to do, 
nothin to do.” he swiveled his 
eyes to Beauclaire. “How you 
comin, son? How soon we leave 
this place? Like Sunday after- 
noon all the tune.” 

Beauclaire was always ready to 
talk about the problem. He out- 
lined it now to Cooper again, and 
Wyatt, listening, grew very tired. 
There is just this one continent,

them continued to flutter, wound- 
ed and trembling, for several 
minutes. 

Wyatt was first out of the ship, 
shaking his head as he ran to get 
back his hearing. To the west, 
over a long slight rise of green 
and yellow trees, a vast black 
cloud of smoke, several miles 
long and very high, was rising 
and boiling. As he stared and 
tried to steady his feet upon the 
shaking ground, he was able to 
gather himself enough to realize 
what this was. 

Meteors. 

He had heard meteors before, 
long before, on a world of Alde- 
baran. Now he could smell the 
same sharp burning disaster, and 
feel the wind rushing wildly back 
to the west, where the meteors 
had struck and hurled the air 
away. 

In that moment Wyatt thought 
of the girl, and although she 
meant nothing to him at all — 
none of these people meant any- 
thing in the least to him — he be- 
gan running as fast as he could 
toward- the west. 

Behind him, white-faced and 
bewildered, came Beauclaire and 
Cooper. 

When Wyatt reached the top of 
the rise, the great cloud covered 
the whole valley before him. Fires 
were burning in the crushed forest 
to his right, and from the lay of 
the cloud he could tell that the 



village of the people was not 
there any more. 

He ran down into the smoke, 
circling toward the woods and 
the stream where he had passed 
an afternoon with the girl. For 
a while he lost himself in the 
smoke, stumbling over rocks and 
fallen trees. 

Gradually the smoke lifted, and 
he began running into some of 
the people. Now he wished that 
he could speak the language. 

They were all wandering quiet- 
ly away from the site of their 
village, none of them looking 
back, Wyatt could see a great 
many dead as he moved, but he 
had no time to stop, no time to 
wonder. It was twilight now, and 
the sun was gone. He thanked 
God that he had a flashlight 
with him; long after night came, 
lie was searching in the raw gash 
where the first meteor had falleji. 

He found the girl, dazed and 
bleeding, in a cleft between two 
rocks. He knelt and took her in 
his arms. Gently, gratefully, 
through the night and the fires 
and past the broken and the 
dead, he carried her back to the 
ship. 

I T had all become frighteningly 
clear to Beauclaire. He talked 
with the people and began to 
understand. 

The meteors had been falling 
since the beginning of time, so the 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



people said. Perhaps it was the 
fault of the great dust- cloud 
through which this planet was 
moving; perhaps it was that this 
had not always been a one-planet 
system — a number of other plan- 
ets, broken and shredded by un- 
known .gravitational forces, 
would provide enough meteors 
for a very long time. And the air 
of this planet being thin, there 
was no real protection as there 
was on Earth. So year after year 
the meteors fell. In unpredictable 
places, at unknowable times, the 
meteors fell, like stones from the 
sling of God. They had been fall- 
ing since the beginning of time. 
So the people, the unconcerned 
people, said. 

And here was Beauclaire’s clue. 
Terrified and shaken as he was, 
Beauclaire was the kind of man 
who saw reason in everything, He 
followed this one to the end. 

In the meantime, Wyatt nursed 
the girl. She had not been badly 
hurt, and recovered quickly. But 
her family and friends were most- 
ly dead now, and so she had no 
reason to leave the ship. 

Gradually Wyatt learned the 
language. The girl’s name was 
ridiculous when spoken in Eng- 
lish, so he called her Donna, 
which was something like her real 
name. She was, like all her peo- 
ple, unconcerned about the mete- 
ors and her dead. She was 
extraordinarily cheerful. Her fea- 



tures were classic, her cheeks 
slim and smiling, her teeth per- 
fect. In the joy and whiteness of 
her, Wyatt saw each day what 
he had seen and known in his 
mind on the day the meteors 
fell. Love to him was something 
new. He was not sure whether or 
not he was in love, and he did 
not care. He realized that he . 
needed this girl and was at home 
with her, could rest with her and 
talk with her, and watch her walk 
and understand what beauty was ; 
and in the ship in those days a 
great peace began to settle over 
him. 

When the girl was well again, 
Beauclaire was in the middle of 
translating the book — the bible- 
like book which all the people 
seemed to treasure so much, As 
his work progressed, a striking 
change began to come over him. 
He spent much time alone under 
the sky, watching the soft haze 
through which, very soon, the 
stars would begin to shine. 

He tried to explain what he felt 
to Wyatt, but Wyatt had no 
time. 

“But, Billy,” Beauclaire said 
fervently, “do you see what these 
people go through? Do you see 
how they live?” 

Wyatt nodded, but his eyes 
were on the girl as she sat listen- 
ing dreamily to a recording of 
ancient music. 

“They live every day waiting,”

Beauclaire said. “They have no 
idea what the meteors are. They 
don’t know that there is anything 
else in the Universe but their 
planet and their sun. They think 
that’s all there is. They don’t 
know why they’re here — but 
when the meteors keep falling 
like that, they have only one con- 
clusion." 

T¥7YATT turned from the girl 
smiling absently. None of 
this could touch him. He had 
seen the order and beauty of 
space, the incredible perfection 
of the Universe, so often and so 
deeply that, like Beauclaire, he 
could not help but believe in a 
Purpose, a grand final meaning. 
When his father had died of an 
insect bite at Oberon he had be- 
lieved in a purpose for that, and 
had looked for it. 6 When his first 
crewmate fell into the acid ocean 
of Alcestis and the second died of 
a horrible rot, Wyatt had seen 
purpose, purpose; and each time 
another man died, for no appar- 
ent reason, on windless, evil use- 
less worlds, the meaning of things 
had become clearer and clearer, 
and now in the end Wyatt was 
approaching the truth, which was 
perhaps that none of it mattered 
at all, 

It especially did not matter 
now. So many things had hap- 
pened that he had lost the capaci- 
ty to pay attention. He was not 



young any more; he wanted to : 
rest, and upon the bosom of this 
girl he had all the reason for any- 
thing and everything he needed. 

But Beauclaire was incoherent. 

It seemed to him that here on this 
planet a great wrong was being 
done, and the more he thought of 
it the more angry and confused 
he became. He went off by him- 
self and looked at the terrible ' 
wound on the face of the planet, 
at all the sweet, lovely, fragrant 
things which would never be 
again, and he ended by cursing 
the nature of things, as Wyatt 
had done so many years before. 
And then he went on with the 
translation of the book. He came 
upon the final passage, still curs- 
ing inwardly, and reread it again 
and again. When the sun was 
rising on a brilliant new morn- 
ing, he went back to the ship. 

“They had a man here once," 
he said to Wyatt, “who was as 
good a writer as there ever was. 
He wrote a book which these 
people use as their Bible. It’s like 
our Bible sometimes, but mostly 
it’s just the opposite. It preaches 
that a man shouldn’t worship 
anything. Would you like to hear 
some of it?” 

Wyatt had been pinned down 
and he had to listen, feeling sorry 
for Beauclaire, who had such a 
long way to go. His thoughts 
were on Donna, who had gone 
out alone to walk in the woods

and say goodbye to her world. 
Soon he would go out and bring 
her back to the ship, and she 
would probably cry a little, but 
she would come. She would come 
with him always, wherever he 
went. 

“I have translated this the best 
way I could,” Beauclaire said 
thickly, “but remember this. This 
man could write. He was Shake- 
speare and Voltaire and all the 
rest all at once. He could make 
you feel. I couldn’t do a decent 
translation if I tried forever, but 
please listen and try to get what 
he means. I’ve put it in the style 
of Ecclesiastes because it’s some- 
thing like that.” 

“All right,” Wyatt said. 

¥>EAUCLAIRE waited for a 
long moment, feeling this 
deeply. When he read, his voice 
was warm and strong, and some- 
thing of his emotion came 
through. As Wyatt listened, he 
found his attention attracted, and 
then he felt the last traces of his 
sadness and weariness fall away. 

He nodded, smiling. 

These are the words Beauclaire 
had gathered from the Book: 

Rise up smiling, and walk with me. 
Rise up in the armor of thy body and 
what shall pass shall make thee un- 
afraid. Walk among the yellow hills, 
for they belong to thee. Walk upon 
grass and let thy feet descend into soft 
soil; in the end when all has failed 
thee the soil shall comfort thee, the 



soil shall receive thee and in thy dark 
bed thou shalt find such peace es is 
thy portion. 

In thine armor, hear my voice. In 
thine armor, hear. Whatsoever thou 
doest, thy friend and thy brother and 
thy woman shall betray thee. Whatso- 
ever thou dost plant, the weeds and 
the seasons shall spite thee. Whereso- 
ever thou goest, the heavens shall fall 
upon thee. Though the nations shall 
come unto thee in friendship thou art 
curst. Know that the Gods ignore thee. 
Know that thou art Life, and that pain 
shall forever come into thee, though 
thy years bi without end and thy days 
without sleep, even and forever. And 
knowing this, in thine armor, thou 
shalt rise up. 

Red and full and glowing is thy 
heart; a steel is forging within thy 
breast. And what can hurt thee now? 
In thy granite mansion, what can hurt 
thee ever? Thou shalt only die. There- 
fore seek not redemption nor forgive- 
ness for thy sins, for know that thou 
hast never sinned. 

Let the Gods come unto the«. 

When it was' finished, Wyatt 
sat very still. 

Beauclaire was looking at him 
intently. 

Wyatt nodded. “I see,” he said. 

“They don’t ask for anything,” 
Beauclaire said. “No immortality, 
no forgiveness, no happiness. 
They take what comes and don’t 
— wonder.” 

Wyatt smiled, rising. He look- 
ed at Beauclaire for a long while, 
trying to think of something to 
say. But there was nothing to 
say. If the young man could be- 
lieve this, here and now, he would 
save himself a long, long, pain- 
ful journey. But Wyatt could not

65 




talk about it — not just yet. 

He reached out and clapped 
Beauclaire gently upon the shoul- 
der. Then he left the ship and 
walked out toward the yellow 
hills, toward the girl and the love 
that was waiting. 

T¥7HAT will they do, Beau- 
** claire asked himself, when 
the stars come out? When there 
are other places to go, will these 
people, too, begin to seek? 

They would. With sadness, he 
knew that they would. For there 



is a chord in Man which is pluck- 
ed by the stars, which will rise 
upward and outward into infinity, 
as long as there is one man any- 
where and one lonely place to 
which he has not been. And there- 
fore what does the meaning mat- 
ter? We are built in this way, and 
so shall we live. 

Beauclaire looked up into the 
sky. 

Dimly, faintly, like God’s eye 
peeking through the silvery haze, 
a single star had begun to shine.

Forecast 

With Plainclothesman Baley in grayer danger than ever, and the 
Spacers holding the threat of retaliation over Earth's head, THE CAVES OF 
STEEL by Isaac Asimov concludes next month with a chilling revelation . 
and a blinding burst of hope. But what a bitterly paradoxical hope! The 
hunt for a killer is always tense enough, but knowing that the fate of a 
world depends on the solution— the solution that must be exactly found and 
sprung or it's worse than none at all— would daunt any man. Yet Baley is 
inexorably forced to find and spring his solution in exactly the wrong way! 

If he keeps it to himself, he will be declassified, replaced by a robot, 
and the Spacers will relentlessly move in. If he reveals it, the only result can 
be chaos! 

THE CAVES OF STEEL is a study of threat to a society; Alan Nourse's 
THE DARK DOOR is a novelet-length analysis of pure distillate of personal 
terror. Wise as you are to the methods of infiltration, you wouldn't believe 
this one— it's too preposterous. But you'll meet and flee from it just the same! 

There's a fine, likable chap whom Theodore Sturgeon calls MR. COS- 
TELLO, HERO ... a man who can't help worrying about every human being 
on all the worlds and in the ships between them. It takes real heroism to be 
willing to help people even if it has to be over their dead bodies!

cal world? In Italy, they tell me 
I have an abdominal tumor. In 
Paris, it’s cancer. And now you 
fat-heads are trying to tell me 
I’m pregnant!” 

I stuffed my stethoscope into 

UNBEGOTTEN CHILD 



my jacket pocket and tried to 
pat her hand. “Take it easy, Mrs. 
Caffey— ” 

“It’s Miss Caffey, damn you,” 
she said snatching her hand 
away, “and better I should have 
gone to an astrologer!” 

“See here, now,” I said, letting 
a stem note enter my voice. 
“You came here requesting a ver- 

67 




ification of the malignancy of 
this growth. Our discovery of a 
six month foetus is a fact, not 
an accusation.” 

“Look, Buster, I’m a thirty- 
six-year-old spinster. Like the 
joke goes, I haven’t been married 
or anything. Also, I knew about 
the birds and the bees before 
you were emptying bedpans. 
Now will you get off this subject 
of babies and find out whether 
it’s safe for me to start any con- 
tinued stories?” 

S UCH protestations from un- 
married mothers were not un- 
common, but Sara Caffey’s cold 
convictions were unshakable. She 
sank back into her seven satin 
pillows and sighed mightily. Her 
wide-spaced, intelligent eyes 
glared at me from a handsome, 
if somewhat overly strong, face. 
Creamy white shoulders swept 
gracefully into gradually darken- 
ing neck skin and frankly tanned 
cheeks and broad forehead. Her 
straight, slender nose was sun- 
burned. 

As resident physician for over 
fifteen years, I had learned pa- 
tience in these matters. But the 
thought that this lovely creature 
expected me to believe that she 
was an unfulfilled old maid got 
under my skin, particularly un- 
der the circumstances. 

“Miss Caffey, I am a physi- 
cian, not a philosopher. Just the 



same, permit me to congratulate 
you on your virginity.” 

“Thanks,” she said, in a voice 
not untinged with pride. 

“However,” I went on, “in 
spite of certain contra-indica- 
tions and irregularities of symp- 
toms such as the absence of 
morning sickness and the like, I 
would like to enlist your coopera- 
tion in delivering yourself of an 
infant within the next three 
months.” 

“Dr. Foley, please under- 
stand!” She threw her hands 
apart in despair. “I love children. 
I would have an acre of them if 
I were married, or even in the 
mood for any other alliance. But 
men just don’t fit ray frame of 
reference. And regardless of what 
kind of a damned fool * I may 
make of myself in the future, I 
haven’t, to date! Doctor, the kind 
of cooperation you ask for hasn’t 
been known for two thousand 
years.” 

I tried another tack. “Well, 
since you arrived without a medi- 
cal history on your condition, 
would you tell us the name of 
your last doctor so we may write 
for a transcript?” 

“Phillipe Sansome, *,in Paris.” 
“The surgeon?” 

She nodded. “And don’t try to 
explain that he misdiagnosed be- 
cause he’s hungry for surgical 
fees. He didn’t plan to operate. 
In fact, that’s why I left. He was

trying some new cure of his own 
that didn’t set well with the staff 
there, and they got into such a 
squabble I figured I’d better re- 
move the cause of it all before 
the dear old man lost his license.” 
While she was speaking, I cas- 
ually drew back the covers and 
exposed her slightly swollen ab- 
domen. It, too, had a surprising 
coat of tan. I donned my stetho- 
scope, moved the diaphragm 
around until I had what I want- 
ed, and held it there. 

“Yes, I know of Dr. Sansome,” 
I told her. “We shall send a wire 
at once for your case record. 
Helps, you know. Now, if you 
will just slip these into your 
ears — ” 

She let me hang the stetho- 
scope around her neck, and even 
brushed back her shining black 
hair so I could adjust the ear- 
pieces for her. 

“If Doctor Sansome had heard 
that,” I said, “he would have 
changed his mind.” 

She listened intently to the 
quick, light, foetal heartbeat for 
over a minute, and gradually a 
faraway gleam lighted her eyes. 
“Oh if you were only right,” she 
said softly, “Here I’ve chased 
stories all over the globe half my 
life, and I’d have the biggest 
story since the flood right here in 
my own tummy!” 

She lay back again. “But of 
course, you’re wrong.” 



“Then what do you call the 
sounds you’ve just heard?” I said 
in complete exasperation. , 

“Gut rumble,” she said. “Now 
go along like a nice intern and 
find me a passel of surgeons and 
let's have at this tumor, cancer, 
bubble -gum or what have you. 
I want out of here, fast as I can 
mend.” 

HpHERE was no reason to keep 
the female news-correspon- 
dent in bed, but she wouldn’t stir. 
She was confident that Phillipe 
Sansome’s findings would con- 
vince us. Three days passed with 
no word from Paris. Then, on the 
fourth day, her medical history 
arrived in the briefcase of the 
famous surgeon himself. 

“I flew,” he apologized, "but it 
took two days to detach myself. 
Delighted to meet you, Dr. Fol- 
ey. Your cable mentioned a Miss 
Sara Caffey, maternity patient. 
Is it possible ?” 

He was large for a Frenchman, 
and his gauntness was com- 
pounded by an obvious lack of 
sleep. His black eyes bore into 
mine as if to drag out what ap- 
peared to me to be a fairly mun- 
dane admission. 

“We call her that,” I said 
shrugging. “And as to her con- 
dition, you may examine her 
yourself.” 

“Sacre bleu!” His eyes rolled 
up like bloodshot cue-balls. “She

left us at her own insistence. 
Aside from ethics, we must not 
disturb her by my reappearance. 
But I have a favor to ask. A giant 
mountain of a fantastic favor. 
Now that I have found her again, 
I must not lose her, certainly not, 
until — ” 

He grabbed pen and paper and 
moved his chair to my desk, He 
wrote briefly. H Voila! These sim- 
ple adjustments in her metabo- 
lism— diet, and just a few so 
petite injections. And may I re- 
main here in the behind-ground, 
incognito? I will help with other 
work — at no cost, of course. I 
will be an orderly, if you will. 
But I must remain in tpuch. 
Close touch.” 

I was a bit nonplussed. A man 
of Sansome’s reputation! It was 
like a United States Senator 
pleading for the opportunity to 
scrub out the men’s room at the 
House of Representatives. Just 
the same, I wouldn’t be stam- 
peded or overawed. Several pro- 
vocative explanations for the 
French doctor’s concern came to 
mind . Was he the repudiated 
father of Sara’s unborn child? 
Or was he a practitioner of 
artificial insemination, with a 
rather unfortunate error to his 
credit? 

“Your request is unusual,” I 
said cautiously, “but not en- 
tirely unreasonable. In order to 
justify it, I am sure you will be 

UNBEGOTTEN CHILD 



willing to explain your interest in 
this case, will you not, Doctor?” 

T¥E frowned, “I suppose I must. 

But you will believe little 
of it. My own staff agreed with 
my diagnosis, but they violently 
rejected my theory. Wait until 
they hear your diagnosis, doc- 
tor!” He unzipped his briefcase. 
“She probably protests that she 
has a malignant tumor, not a 
baby,” he remarked as he laid 
thick sheafs of paper on my desk. 
“You are so very right,” I said. 
“Madam oiselle is magnificent,” 
he observed, running slender, 
wrinkled hands through his sparse 
gray hair. “But her obstinacy 
will not avail against evolution. 
No more than we doctors’ monu- 
mental ignorance.” 

“Evolution? Explain, please.” 
“Here is the case history.” He 
drummed on it with his short- 
clipped nails. “In it, you will find 
that Caffey came to us three 
months ago with her body cavity 
in the grasp of a small octopus 
of a soft form carcinoma. The 
pain reached from pelvis to 
chest.” 

“Incredible!” I exclaimed. 
Sansome spread his hand on 
the record sheets. “Facts are 
never incredible,” he reminded 
me gently. “What follows, how- 
ever, will tax your credulity, and 
I beg of you to allow me to im- 
pose an outrageous concept whose 

71 



only virtue appears to be its 
demonstrated validity.’* 

“Proceed.” 

“In forty years of slicing away 
tumerous growths, I had become 
morbid at the dreadful incidence 
of recurrence and the obscene 
mortality rate. In spite of all our 
techniques, these cancers have 
increased with the persistence of 
Nature herself. 

“In a fit of prolonged depres- 
sion brought on by a foolishly 
strenuous research of histories, 
my mind stumbled into a stupid 
preoccupation with a few isolated 
cases of exogenic pregnancy. One 
which fascinated me was the 
young 17 -year-old boy from 
whose lung a surgeon removed a 
live three-month foetus. Some- 
how the obvious explanation re- 
fused to satisfy me. It was, of 
course, concluded that the foetus 
was an undeveloped twin to the 
boy himself. 

“This could be so; but on what 
facts was this assumption based? 
None. Only the absence of any 
other theory justified the con- 
cept. The surgeon had expected 
to find a hard carcinoma. 

“And it came to me suddenly 
that he had found his cancer ! 

“My interpolation was this: 
Mankind is suffering an evolu- 
tionary change in his repro- 
ductive procedure. The high 
incidence of various tumors evi- 
dences Nature’s experiments in 



developing a sexual reproduc- 
tion,” 

S ANSOME’S statement so flab- 
bergasted me that I looked at 
him for signs of facetiousness or 
irrationality. His extreme fatigue 
was evident — but his calmness 
and clarity of self-expression in 
a foreign language indicated no 
mental confusion. A hoax of such 
magnitude was outside the realm 
of possibility for a surgeon of his 
distinction. 

The man was simply following 
a blind alley of reasoning, set 
off by his life-long frustration 
of battling cancer. 

I mustered my patience and 
drew him out, hoping he would 
find a contradiction in his own 
theory. 

“This is a rather staggering no- 
tion, Dr. Sansome,” I said. “Have 
you been able to support it with 
— additional evidence?” 

“Until Miss Caffey,” he said, 
“frankly, no. Not the kind of 
evidence that is acceptable. But 
the theory has much to defend it. 
In your own Journal of the 
A. M. A., May 7, 1932, Dr. Maud 
Slye published the first solid evi- 
dence that predisposition to 
so-called malignant tumor is he- 
reditary. Is this not a better 
characteristic of a true mutation, 
rather than of a disease?” 

“Perhaps,” I said. “But how 
does Mother Nature justify the 



72 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



desirability of a change from our 
present rather successful bisex- 
ual system? And isn’t she being 
rather cruel in her methods? 
Think of the millions she has 
made suffer in her experiments ” 

“Mother Nature” Sansome 
pronounced positively, “is neither 
kind nor cruel. She is manifestly 
indifferent to all but the goal of 
survival of the species. Our civi- 
lization has set out to thwart her 
with increasingly more effective 
methods of birth-control. In the 
light of survival, Nature is most 
justified in trying to bring mil- 
lions of frustrated, childless hu- 
mans to parenthood. 

“MEANWHILE » he said, rif- 
fling the case history of 
Sara Caffey, “let us examine the 
evidence at hand. Our patient 
arrived in Paris positively can- 
cerous. After confirming the 
diagnosis, I proposed an unprec- 
edented treatment based on my 
theory. We know several body 
conditions which promote the 
rapid development of carcinoma, 
such as excess alkalinity and high 
blood sugar content and so forth. 
Instead of trying to reduce these 
and fight the tumor, I reversed 
the treatment and aided Miss 
Caffey’s body to support and en- 
courage its growth to what l pre- 
dicted would be a new maturity. 

“And what happened?” He 
thretifr up his hands. “In two 



months, the tendrils of the octo- 
pus withdrew into the central 
body of the tumor. The tendency 
to spread in search for attenuated 
nourishment was reversed with 
the treatment. This alone was 
an accomplishment, for it would 
have made the growth operable 
in a short time. 

“Unfortunately, word of my 
unorthodox prescription reached 
a jealous colleague, and he set off 
such a quarrel at the Institute 
that Miss Caffey packed up and 
left with the generous miscon- 
ception that she was saving me 
from embarrassment. I had no 
opportunity to assure her that 
the Cancer Institute would de- 
cide ultimately in my favor — 
which it shall when I return with 
a photostat of a certain birth 
certificate.” 

He smiled for the first time, 
and his charm was so powerful 
that I sincerely wanted to believe 
in him. I could see no use in 
denying him his request, for his 
prescriptions were of an innocu- 
ous nature for a normally preg- 
nant woman such as Sara Caffey. 
I trusted that a normal birth of 
a typical baby would finally dis- 
suade him. 

I extended my hand again. 
“You are most welcome to stay 
with us, doctor,” I told him. “The 
treatment you desire is within 
reason, and I admire your tenac- 
ity with your theory. I hope you 



UNBEGOTTEN CHILD 



73 




will forgive me, however, if I 
say that I find your premises 
rather tenuous. I feel that we 
will witness a very normal birth, 
and ultimately Miss Caffey will 
find it to her peace of mind to 
confess a secret marriage, or, at 
most — an alliance of which she 
may be pathologically ashamed 
at the moment.” 

Sansome grasped my hand with 
enthusiasm. “Bien! Tres bien!” 
he exclaimed. “This is more gen- 
erous even than I expected. Cer- 
tainly I do not expect a scientist 
of your station to swallow my 
theory at a gulp, Dr. Foley. I 
will admit that my persistence 
depends more than it should on 
intuition. But we shall see. I am 
grateful to you.” And he kissed 
me firmly on each cheek. 

A STUDY of Sansome’s care- 
fully prepared case history 
on Sara Caffey did disturb me a 
little. I ordered a thorough re- 
examination, and was left with 
some puzzling conclusions at the 
apparent absence of tumorous 
growth, malignant or otherwise. 

Sara was enduring most of the 
classic symptoms of typical preg- 
nancy, and was enjoying Dr. San- 
sotne's treatment hugely. She 
guzzled the alkaline-producing 
fruit juices, fortified with care- 
fully rationed dribbles of gin. 
She nibbled contentedly at the 
sweets which the Frenchman sup- 



plied anonymously. And she 
raised merry hell because we re- 
fused to operate. 

After two weeks, she threatened 
to leave. I was paged over the 
P. A. and got to her room in 
time to catch her trying to zip 
up her skirt. 

She looked at me impatiently, 
and then back to her abdomen. 
“Damned thing’s getting out of 
hand.” 

She had on an expensive tweed 
suit, and the smart, powder-blue 
cashmere coat I helped her into 
made her look her role of dis- 
tinguished world traveler, syn- 
dicated columnist and woman of 
parts. 

She hunched her shoulders for- 
ward slightly, so the loose folds 
of the coat concealed her pro- 
truding middle. 

“Thanks,” she said casually. 
“I’ll write you a check and be 
on my way,” 

“Dr. Sansome will be disap- 
pointed,” I said casually. 

“You heard from him?” she 
asked with interest. 

I nodded. 

She put her hands on her hips. 
“And you still persist with your 
fatuous idea that I’m going to 
have a baby?” 

’ “Let us say,” I evaded, “that 
we have adopted Dr. Sansome’s 
treatment on a wait-and-see 
basis. You said yourself that he 
refused to operate. We have defi- 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



nitely confirmed that much. Your 
condition is still inoperable, but 
you are coming along fine.” 
"Well, now, why didn’t you tell 
me that before.” She threw off 
her coat and relieved the pres- 
sure of her waist zipper with a 
grateful sigh. "Now you’re mak- 
ing sense. Send out for another 
Spillane. I’ll go along with that. 
But no more of this drivel about 
transferring me to the maternity 
ward, see?” 

r¥lEN nights later, she changed 
her mind. I passed her room 
after a late emergency case. The 
door was open and I heard her 
crying softly to herself. I stopped 
in. Her bed lamp was on, and 
for a change she looked all 
woman. 

I felt her pulse and asked, 
“What’s the matter, Sara?” 

“I’m going to have a baby!” 
she sobbed. “I’ve been feeling 
something peculiar for some time. 
But tonight it kicked the hell 
out of me.” 

“Want to talk about it?” I 
asked, still holding her wrist. 

She looked at me with genuine 
bafflement in her eyes. Her face 
was puckered up like a hurt 
child's. “But it’s so impossible, 
doctor. I’m sorry I talked to you 
the way I have, but so help me, 
I’m a good girl.” 

I almost said, Well , these 
things happen, but that would 



have sounded pretty silly. It was 
evident that she still wouldn’t 
admit even to herself how and 
when it had happened. 

“Ever go on a good binge?” I 
suggested. 

“Not since I was sixteen,” she 
exclaimed. “But I could use one 
right now. No, that might hurt 
the baby.” She folded her arms 
protectively around her middle. 
“I don’t get it. I don’t get it at 
all. But if that’s the way it is — ” 
A crooked, pleased smile wrinkled 
tears from her cheeks. “Leave 
it to Sary to do things the 
unusual way.” 

She looked up at me. “Did 
you know I was the first white 
woman to interview a Rajah’s 
harem eunuch?” 

“Looks like you have a real 
story this time,” I said, playing 
along with her. 

“Yeah. But who in hell will 
write it?” 

pHILLIPE Sansome made 
-*■ himself eminently useful. He 
assisted in surgery every morn- 
ing, refusing fees and pleading 
with everyone to maintain his 
anonymity. The staff was in on 
the conspiracy, and the nurses 
smiled indulgently at him behind 
his back. But Sansome was too 
great a man to ridicule. The gen- 
eral feeling was the same as mine. 
He was older than he thought, 
not in body, but in over-tired

nerves and exhausted mind. None 
contested his skill with the scal- 
pel; but none gave ten cents 
worth of o»edence to his twist on 
the theory of evolution. 

As Sara’s confinement proceed- 
ed with precise conformity to 
my expectations, I thought San- 
some would lose heart — but he 
didn’t. He arranged to be present 
in the delivery room with as 
much interest as if we expected 
a breach birth of a two-headed 
panda. 

I was unfortunately called to 
Baltimore at the last minute. I 
flew both ways, but my haste was 
in vain. Sara gave birth while 
I was still aloft. 

I checked in with more excite- 



ment than I’d thought possible. 
I asked at the desk, “How's 
Caffey.” 

“Fine. Gave birth an hour ago. 
Beautiful little girl — ” 

I didn't wait for more. I dashed 
upstairs to the maternity ward, 
where Sara had finally consented 
to be moved, and slipped into 
her room. 

She was tired, but conscious. 
She smiled at me peculiarly. 

“So it’s a girl!’' I exclaimed. 
“Wait until I see Sansome. A 
beautiful, healthy, normal baby!” 

A hand tapped me softly on the 
shoulder, and I turned to look 
into Sansome’s triumphant eyes. 

“Without a navel,” he said.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 







TO THE END OF TIME : THE 
BEST OF OLAF STAPLEDON. 
Edited by Basil Davenport. 
Funk & W agnails Co., New York, 
1953. 790 pages, $5.00 

rpHE science fiction event of 
1953, for American readers, is 
the publication of this huge om- 
nibus of five science fantasies by 
the late British writer Olaf 
Stapledon. For incomprehensible 
reasons, only one of the five 
novels has ever been published 
before in the United States: Odd 
John, the famous story of the 
mutant homo superiors and their 
ill-fated attempt to establish 



their own society on an island 
in the Pacific. 

The other four are Last and 
First Men, Stapledon’ s weird and 
wonderful dream of the distant 
tomorrows of Man in the Uni- 
verse; Star Maker, his vivid fan- 
tasy of travels among different 
life-forms in our galaxy; Sirius, 
a touching story of an intelligent 
dog and its reactions to the com- 
plexities of human civilization; 
and The Flames, a rather undis- 
tinguished short novel about a 
man in contact with the intelli- 
gences that inhabit fire. 

Olaf Stapledon was a man pos- 
sessed by the idea of Infinity, 



* * * ★ ★ SHELF 



77 




an overwhelming pessimist, his 
whole life colored by preoccupa- 
tion with “the tragic disorder of 
our whole terrestrial hive,” as 
he put it. This combination 
of magnificently untrammeled 
imagination and a persistent 
sense of the futility of life 
resulted in some of the most off- 
trail science imaginings in fan- 
tastic literature. 

Furthermore, as Basil Daven- 
port points out in his pleasant 
Introduction, the novels are the 
original source of many of the 
current concepts in science fic- 
tion. The fuller and more circum- 
stantial development of many of 
his ideas by other authors is not 
reprehensible in the least. For 
one of Stapledon’s major defects 
was that he was a very bad 
novelist. His books are melanges 
of often undeveloped science fic- 
tion concepts and bombastic 
philosophizing. Today’s writers 
frequently do the ideas they take 
from Stapledon a real favor by 
developing them more adequate- 

ly- 

However, despite its many 
faults, this is definitely not a 
book to be missed. It belongs 
with the science fiction classics. 

MAN IN SPACE by Heinz 
Haber. Illustrated by Jerry 
Milord. Bobbs Merrill Co., Inc., 
Indianapolis, 1953. 291 pages, 
$3.75 



I N the rapidly increasing bibli- 
ography of serious books on 
space travel, this excellent vol- 
ume has a special value for the 
lay reader. It is the first popular 
book on the subject to emphasize 
the “condition of Man in space” 
rather than the spaceship itself 
and the engineering aspects of 
space travel. 

Heinz Haber is one of the 
nation’s foremost experts on 
“space medicine,” the physiology 
and pathology of living things 
subjected to the unprecedented 
conditions encountered beyond 
the Earth’s thin envelope of 
atmosphere. He is, therefore, al- 
most uniquely competent to dis- 
cuss the problems, of Man in 
space, and in this volume he 
does so with authority and also 
with a pleasant clarity of style 
that makes his material very 
easy to absorb. 

For those who wanf to know 
not only what it will be like to 
travel in space, but also how 
much we know about what it 
will be like, this book sum- 
marizes an enormous amount of 
experimentation (mostly mili- 
tary) on the effects of accelera- 
tion, weightlessness, lack of 
oxygen, cosmic radiation, and all 
the other problems of space flight 
— including some most of us 
never even dreamed of, such as 
the boiling of blood in the veins 
at low pressures. 



79 GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Dr. Haber’s final conclusion is 
that while none of the planets 
around our sun will support our 
existence, nor will they possess 
any intelligent life of their own, 
nevertheless Man will definitely 
“take to space” — if only to prove 
that he can . 

Dr. Haber closes his book with 
a fine plea for the conservation 
of our Earth’s resources and the 
continual improvement of its liv- 
ing conditions, since “coloniza- 
tion of the Solar System ... is 
an utterly unrealistic, utopian 
idea.” 

I agree with Dr. Haber’s con- 
servationist sentiments whole- 
heartedly. But somehow I don’t 
think we know enough about our 
own solar system — or our future 
in science — to make as dogmatic 
a statement as the one quoted. 
Like those who once said heavier - 
than-air -flight was impossible, 
Dr. Haber may eventually be 
proved wrong. 

SECOND FOUNDATION by 
Isaac Asimov, Gnome Press , 
New York, 1953. 210 pa^es, $2.75 

VJ7ITH this volume, Asimov’s 
” Foundation trilogy is com- 
pleted. Together with its two pre- 
ceding volumes, also published 
by Gnome, it comprises our first 
great sociological space opera. 
Comparisons with E- E. Smith’s 
six-volume Lensman series, the 



next-to-the-last volume of which 
is reviewed below, are natural, 
since the Smith opus is unques- 
tionably one of the biggest pre- 
sociological space-mellers in 
science fiction history. 

Both series engage in science 
extrapolations that are, to say 
the least, improbable; both are 
galactic or more in scope; both 
are tour de forces of the imagi- 
nation. But Asimov’s work, based 
as it is on fairly sound social 
principles and the activities of 
fairly normal human beings, has 
a pressing sense of reality that 
Smith’s fairy tales lack all the 
way through. 

This third volume contains the 
last two novellas Asimov has 
written on his subject: the story 
of the subjugation (by a member 
of the Second Foundation) of the 
Mule, that crippled mutant who 
nearly ruined Hari Seldon’s psy- 
cho-historical matrix for the 
hastening of the organization of 
the Second Galactic Empire; and 
the tale of Arkady Darrell, 
Homir Munn, and the simple 
Preem Palver, and how they 
worked out the fragile plans of 
the Second Foundationeers (mas- 
ters of mental science) to set the 
Galaxy on its correct track 
through the wildernesses of the 
future. 

For my taste, it is a thorough- 
ly satisfying and adult play of 
the scientific imagination.

SECOND STAGE LENSMAN 
by Edward E. Smith, Ph.D. Fan- 
tasy Press, Reading, Pa., 1953. 
307 pages, $3.00 

T^OR over 25 years, E. E. Smith 
has been the beloved of young 
space opera addicts, for he is the 
inventor and sole producer of in- 
tergalactic melodrama on which 
most of the later imitations have 
been based. It is a real achieve- 
ment, this invention, something 
that will live on for years as a 
classic of science fiction juvenali a. 

Of course, it is pretty dull go- 
ing for people who want a bit 
more than thud and blunder, ir- 
resistable forces conquering im- 
movable objects, and a style 
reminiscent of the balloons in 
the s.f. comic strips. 

In the present volume, Kim- 
ball Kinnison, dreamboat, Sec- 
ond Stage Lensman and whatnot, 
and his mighty crew of assistants 
of various shapes and planetary 
origins are still hunting down the 
Evil Powers that are attacking 
us from outside our Galaxy, and 
still failing to find the real vil- 
lains, the Eddorians. They are 
still ridding the Universe of Bos- 
konians instead, and a good 
thing, too — the vicious, sadistic 
drug-peddlers! And, in the end, 
Kim acquires his Clarrissa in 
holy matrimony — at last! 

There is a foreword, too, that 
gives the reader a synopsis of 



the previous books in the series 
— excellent for orientation in the 
Smith fairyland. 

AGAINST THE FALL OF 
NIGHT by Arthur C. Clarke. 
Gnome Press, New York, 1953. 
223 pages, $2.75 

A RTHUR Clarke, a man of 
many facets- — he is the au- 
thor of the only Book of the 
Month Club selection (non- 
fiction) on space travel — has here 
written a charming fantasy of the 
far-distant future, designed for 
boys and girls of all ages. 

It deals with the adventures of 
young Alvin, a billion years from 
now, and his efforts to get the 
remnants of mankind on this 
planet out of the lethargy that 
near-immortality has given it. 

First he escapes from the 
“prison of Diaspar,” the city of 
perfection where only initiative 
is dead, and finds the rich rural 
civilization of Lys. Then, with 
the aid of some magical robots, 
he uncovers a million-year-old 
spaceship and takes off to find 
what else is left alive in the 
Galaxy. The tale ends with a re- 
assurance of mankind’s renais- 
sance. 

“It is a light, simple, fast-mov- 
ing and often richly imaginative 
fantasy, a very pleasant time- 
passer indeed.

By ROGER DEE 

A veferon veterinarian might 
have vamoosed— but Watts had 
fo help any sick animal . 

Illustrated by CONNELL - 



N OTHING more exciting 
ever happened to Oliver 
Watts than being reject- 
ed by his draft board for a punc- 
tured eardrum until, deferring as 
usual to the superior judgment of 
his Aunt Katisha and of Glenna 
— his elder and militantly spin- 
ster sister — he put away his life- 
long dream and took up, at the 



age of twenty-five, the practice of 
veterinary medicine. 

The relinquished dream was 
Oliver’s ambition, cherished since 
childhood, to become some day a 
hunter and trainer of jungle ani- 
mals. It had been discouraged 
firmly and at length by his Aunt 
Katisha, who maintained that 
the skin of the last male Watts 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




was not to be risked in a pur- 
suit so perilous; and his Aunt 
Katisha won. He would do far 
better, Oliver realized finally, to 
resign himself to the quiet sub- 
urban life of Landsdale, Flori- 
da, and to perpetuate the Watts 
line by marrying some worthy 
and practical local girl. The quiet 
life, it developed, was that of a 
D. V. M.; the worthy and prac- 
tical girl, Miss Orella Simms of 
Tampa, to whom he was now 
engaged. 

To put it plainly, Oliver was 
until the moment of his Great 
Opportunity a good-humored 
stooge with a cowlick and a sense 
of responsibility, whose invari- 
able cue was family obligation 
and whose crowning virtue was 
docility. He was maneuvered in- 
to becoming a D. V. M. (though 
to tell the truth the profession 
suited him well enough, being 
the nearest possible approach to 
realizing his ambition) solely be- 
cause the veterinary college in 
Tampa was near enough to 
Landsdale for commuting and 
because his later practice could 
be carried on under the guiding 
aegis of his personal matriarchy. 
The virtuous, and vapid, Orella 
Simms became his fiancee by the 
same tactics and for the same 
reasons. 

Oliver had considered rebel- 
lion, of course, but common 
sense discouraged the idea. He 



had no intimates outside his fam- 
ily nor any experience with the 
world beyond Landsdale and 
Tampa, and his fledgling self- 
confidence invariably bogged 
down in a welter of introspective 
apprehensions when he thought 
of running away. Where would 
he go, and to whom could he 
turn in emergency? 

Such was the character and 
condition of Oliver Watts when 
his newly undertaken practice of 
veterinary medicine threw him 
into the company of “Mr. Thom- 
as Furnay” and of a girl whose 
name, as nearly as it can be ren- 
dered into English, was Perrl- 
high-C-trill-and-A-above. Their 
advent brought Oliver face to 
face for the first time in his sed- 
entary life with High Adventure 
— with adventure so high, as a 
matter of fact, that it took him 
literally and bodily out of this 
humdrum world. 

rriHE initial step was taken 
-*• when Mr. Furnay, known to 
Landsdale as a wealthy and ec- 
centric old recluse who had re- 
cently leased a walled property 
on Federal Route 27 that had 
once been the winter retreat of a 
Prohibition-era gangster, was 
driven by emergency to call upon 
Oliver for professional service. 
Mr. Furnay usually kept very 
much to himself behind his iron- 
grilled gates and his miles of 



clean break 



83 




stuccoed wall; but it happened 
that in pursuit of his business 
(whose true nature would have 
confounded Landsdale to its in- 
sular core) he had just bought up 
the entire menagerie of an expir- 
ing circus billed as Skadarian 
Brothers, and it was the sudden 
illness of one of his newly ac- 
quired animals that forced him 
to breach his isolation. 

Mr. Furnay called at the Watts 
place in his town car, driven by a 
small, dark and taciturn chauf- 
feur named Bivins. He found Oli- 
ver at work in his neatly ordered 
clinic at the rear of the big house, 
busily spooning cod-liver oil into 
a trussed and thoroughly out- 
raged chow named Champ. 

“I have a sick animal,” Mr. 
Furnay stated tersely. He was a 
slight man with a moderately 
long and wrinkled face, a Pan- 
ama hat two sizes too large and a 
voice that had, in spite of its ex- 
cellent diction, a jarring timbre 
and definitely foreign flavor. 

Oliver blinked, surprised and a 
little dismayed that Fate should 
have sent him so early in his ca- 
reer a known and patently cap- 
tious millionaire. Bivins, waiting 
in visored and putteed impassiv- 
ity to reopen the door for his 
master, was silently impressive; 
the town car, parked on the 
crushed shell driveway outside, 
glittered splendidly in the late 
afternoon sunshine: 



‘Til be happy to call later in 
the day,” Oliver said. He re- 
moved the padded block that had 
held Champ’s jaws apart, and 
narrowly missed losing a finger 
as the infuriated chow snapped 
at his hand. “My aunt and sister 
are bringing my fiancee down 
from Tampa for dinner this eve- 
ning, and I can’t leave the clinic 
until they get here. Someone 
might call for his pet.” 

Mr. Furnay protested his ex- 
tremity of need. “The animal 
s'lffers periodic convulsions,” he 
said. ‘‘It may be dangerously 
ill!” 

Oliver unstrapped Champ from 
his detention frame and dodged 
with practiced skill when the 
chow tried to bite him on the 
thigh. He had taken it for grant- 
ed — having heard none of the 
gossip concerning Mr. Fumay’s 
recent purchase of the Skadarian 
Brothers’ menagerie — that the 
sick animal in question was a 
dog or cat or perhaps a saddle 
horse, and the bald description 
of its symptoms startled him 
more than Champ’s predictable 
bid for revenge. 

“Convulsions? What sort of an- 
imal is it, Mr. Furnay?” 

“A polar bear,” said Mr. Fur- 
nay. 

“Polar bear!” echoed Oliver, 
and in his shock of surprise he 
dropped a detaining strap and 
let Champ loose. 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




'T'HE dog sprang across the 
room — without a breath of 
warning, as chows will — and bit 
Bivins on the leg just above his 
puttee. The chauffeur screamed 
in a high and peculiarly raucous 
voice and jerked away, jabber- 
ing in a vowelless and totally 
unfamiliar foreign tongue. Mr. 
Furnay said something sharply 
in the same grating language; 
Bivins whipped out a handker- 
chief, pressed it over the tear in 
his whipcords and went quickly 
out to the car. 

Oliver collared the snarling 
Champ and returned him to his 
cage, where the dog pressed bris- 
tling against the bars and stared 
at Mr. Furnay hungrily with 
wicked, muddy eyes. 

Mr. Furnay’s shocked voice 
said, behind Oliver, “What a 
ghastly world, where even the 
pets . 

He broke off sharply as Oliver 
turned from the cage. 

“I’m truly sorry, Mr. Furnay,” 
Oliver apologized. “If there’s 
anything I can do ... a dressing 
for Bivins’ leg — ” 

Mr. Furnay gathered himself 
with an effort. “It is nothing, a 
scratch that will heal quickly. 
But my bear — you will come to 
see him at once?” 

At another time, the thought 
of absenting himself without due 
notice to his Aunt Katisha and 
Glenna would have prompted 



Oliver to refuse; but the present 
moment called more for diplo- 
macy than for convention. Better 
to suffer matriarchal displeasure, 
he thought, than to risk a dam- 
age suit by a millionaire. 

“I’ll come at once,” Oliver said. 
“I owe ypu that, I think, after 
the fright Champ gave you.” 

And, belatedly, the realization 
that he might handle a bear — a 
great, live, lumbering bear! — 
surged up inside him to titillate 
his old boyhood yearning. Per- 
haps it was as well that his aunt 
and sister were away; this chance 
to exercise his natural skill at 
dealing with animals was too 
precious to decline. 

“Of course I won’t guarantee a 
cure,” Oliver said, qualifying his 
promise, “because I’ve never di- 
agnosed such a case. But I think 
I can help your bear.” 

Oddly enough, he was almost 
sure that he could. Oliver, in his 
younger days, had read a great 
deal on the care and treatment of 
circus animals, and the symp- 
toms in this instance had a fa- 
miliar sound. Mr. Furnay’s bear, 
he thought, in all probability had 
worms. 

The Furnay town car purred 
away, leaving Oliver to marvel at 
his own daring while he collected 
the instruments and medicines he 
might need. 

In leaving the clinic he noted 
that Mr. Fumay’s chauffeur had 



CLEAN BREAK 



85 




dropped his handkerchief at the 
doorway in his hurry to be gone — 
but Oliver by this time was in too 
great a hurry to stop and retrieve 
it. 

His Aunt Katisha might spoil 
the whole adventure on the in- 
stant with a telephone call from 
Tampa. Bivins could wait. 

^T^HE drive, after a day spent 
in the antiseptic confines of 
his clinic, was like a holiday 
jaunt. 

The late June sun was hot and 
bright, the rows of suburban 
houses trim and clean as scrub- 
bed children sunning themselves 
among color-splashed crotons and 
hibiscus and flaming poincianas. 
Oliver whistled gaily as he turn- 
ed his little white-paneled call 
truck off the highway and drove 
between twin ranks of shedding 
cabbage palms toward the iron 
gates of the Fumay estate. 

A uniformed gateman who 
might have been a twin to Bivins 
admitted him, pointing out a 
rambling white building that lay 
behind the stuccoed mansion, and 
shut the gate. Oliver parked his 
truck before the menagerie build- 
ing — it had been a stable in the 
heyday of the Prohibition-era 
gangster, when it had held horses 
or cases of contraband as occa- 
sion demanded — and found Biv- 
ins waiting for him. 

Bivins, looking upset and sull- 



en in immaculate new whipcords, 
opened the sliding doors without 
a word. 

The vast inside of the remod- 
eled stable was adequately lighted 
by roof-windows and fluorescent 
bulbs, but seemed dark for the 
moment after the glare of sun 
outside; there was a smell, fa- 
miliar to every circus -goer, of 
damp straw and animal dung, 
and a restless background stir of 
purring and growling and pacing. 

Oliver gaped when his eyes di- 
lated enough to show him the 
real extent of Mr. Furnay's me- 
nagerie holdings. At the north 
end of the building two towering 
Indian elephants swayed on pick- 
et, munching hay and shuffling 
monotonously on padded, pon- 
derous feet. A roped -off enclo- 
sure held half a dozen giraffes 
which nibbled in aristocratic de- 
precation at feed-bins bracketed 
high on the walls; and beyond 
them three disdainful camels lay 
on untidily folded legs, sneering 
glassily at the world and at each 
other. 

The east and west sides of the 
building were lined with rank 
after rank of cages holding a 
staggering miscellany of preda- 
tors: great-maned lions with their 
sleek green-eyed mistresses; rest- 
less tigers undulating their stripes 
back and forth and grinning in 
sly, tusky boredom ; chattering 
monkeys and chimpanzees; leop- 




CLEAN BREAK 



ards and cheetahs and a pair of 
surly black jaguars whose claw- 
scored hides indicated either a re- 
cent difference of opinion or a 
burst of conjugal affection. 

The south end of the vast room 
had been recently partitioned off, 
with a single heavy door break- 
ing the new wall at its center. 
On either side of this door the 
bears held sway: shaggy griz- 
zlies, black bears, cinnamon and 
brown; spectacled Andeans and 
sleek white polars padding silent- 
ly on tufted feet. 

The sick bear sulked in a cage 
to himself, humped in an oddly 
doglike pose with his great head 
hanging disconsolately. 

Oliver sized up the situation, 
casting back to past reading for 
the proper procedure. 

“I’ll need a squeeze-cage and 
a couple of cage boys to help 
immobilize the brute,” he said. 
“Will you — ” 

He was startled, in turning, to 
find that Bivins had not accom- 
panied him into the building. He 
was not alone, however. The door 
at the center of the partitioning 
wall had opened while he spoke, 
and a slender blonde girl in the 
briefest of white sunsuits was 
looking at him. 

APPARENTLY she had not 
expected Oliver, for there 
was open interest in her clear 
green eyes. She said something in 



a clear and musical — but com- 
pletely unintelligible — voice that 
ranged, with a remarkably ope- 
ratic effect, through two full 
octaves. 

Oliver stared. “I’m here to doc- 
tor the sick bear,” he said. 

“Oh, a native the girl said in 
English. 

Obviously she was trying to 
keep her voice within the tonal 
range of his own, but in spite of 
the effort it trilled distractingly 
up and down the scale in a fash- 
ion that left Oliver smitten with a 
sudden j and unfamiliar weakness 
of the knees. 

“May I help?” she said. 

She might, Oliver replied. She 
could have had as readily, he 
might have added, a pint of his 
blood. 

Many times while they worked, 
finding a suitable squeeze-cage 
and dragging it against the bear’s 
larger cage so that the two doors 
coincided, Oliver found the prim 
and reproachful image of Miss 
Orella Simms rising to remind 
him of his obligations; but for 
the first time in his life an obliga- 
tion was surprisingly easy to 
dismiss. His assistant’s lively con- 
versation, which was largely un- 
informative though fascinatingly 
musical, bemused him even to the 
point of shrugging off his Aunt 
Katisha’s certain disapproval. 

The young lady, it seemed, 
came from a foreign country 



88

whose name was utterly unpro- 
nounceable; Oliver gathered that 
she had not been long with Mr. 
Furnay, who was of another na- 
tionality, and that she was home- 
sick for her native land — for its 
“saffron sun on turquoise hills 
and umber sea,” which could only 
be poetic exaggeration or simple 
unfamiliarity with color terms of 
a newly learned language — and 
that she was as a consequence 
very lonely. 

She was, incredibly, a trainer 
of animals. 

“Not of such snarling fierce 
ones as yours,” she said, with a 
little shiver for the polar bear 
watching them sullenly through 
the bars, “but of my own gentle 
beasts, who are friends.” 

Her name was a startling com- 
bination of soprano sounds that 
might have been written as Perrl- 
high-C- trill- and- A- above, but 
which Oliver was completely un- 
able to manage. 

“Would you mind,” he asked, 
greatly daring, “if I called you 
Pearl instead?” 

She would not. But apparently 
Mr. Furnay would. 

rriHE millionaire, who had en- 
tered the menagerie unheard, 
spoke sternly to the girl in his 
own raucous tongue and pointed 
a peremptory finger toward the 
door through which she had 
come. The girl murmured “Ai 



docssain, Tsammai” in a disap- 
pointed tone, gave Oliver a smile 
that would have stunned a harem 
guard, and disappeared again 
into her own territory. 

Oliver, being neither Chester- 
field nor eunuch, was left with 
the giddy sensation of a man 
struggling to regain his balance 
after a sudden earth temblor. 

His client reoriented him 
brusquely, “Treat my bear,” Mr. 
Furnay said. 

“I’ve been waiting for help ” 
Oliver said defensively. “If you’ll 
send around your menagerie 
manager and a cage boy or 
two — ” 

“I have none,” Mr. Furnay said 
shortly. “There are only the four 
of us here, and not one will ap- 
proach within touching distance 
of a brute so vicious.” 

Oliver stared at him in aston- 
ishment . Four of them meant 
only Bivins, the gateman, the 
lovely blonde creature who called 
herself Perrl-high- C-trill -and- A- 
above and Mr. Furnay himself. 

“But four inexperienced people 
can’t possibly look after a men- 
agerie of this size!” Oliver pro- 
tested. “Circus animals aren’t 
house pets, Mr. Furnay — they’re 
restless and temperamental, and 
they need expert care. They bite 
and claw each other — ” 

“There will be more of us 
later,” Mr. Furnay said morosely, 
“but I doubt that numbers will

help. We had not anticipated a 
ferocity so appalling, and I fear 
that my error may have proved 
the ruin of an expensive project. 
The native beasts were never so 
fierce on other-—” 

He broke off. “I am sorry. You 
will have to manage as best you 
can alone.” 

And he left the menagerie with- 
out looking back. 

To deal tersely with subsequent 
detail, Oliver did manage alone — 
after a fashion and up to a point. 
It was a simple matter, once he 
found a four-foot length of con- 
veniently loose board, to prod the 
unhappy bear from his larger 
prison to the smaller. The process 
of immobilizing the brute by 
winching the squeeze-cage tight 
was elementary. 

But in his casting-back Oliver 
had overlooked two vitally im- 
portant precautions: he’d forgot- 
ten to secure the gear fastenings, 
and he’d neglected to rope the 
smaller cage to the larger. 

The bear, startled by the prick 
of the needle when Oliver gave 
him a sizable injection of nem- 
butal, reacted with a frantic 
struggling that reversed the action 
of the unsecured winch and forced 
the two cages apart. The door 
burst open, sprung by the sud- 
den pressure. 

The bear stood free. 

A considerable amount of legit- 
imate excitement could be in- 



jected into such a moment by 
reporting that the bear, at last in 
a position to revenge itself for 
past indignities, leaped upon its 
tormentor with a blood -freezing 
roar and that Oliver, a fragile 
pygmy before that near-ton of 
slavering fury, escaped only by 
a hair or was annihilated on the 
spot. 

Neither circumstance devel- 
oped, however, for the reason that 
the bear was already feeling the 
effects of the anesthetic given it 
and wanted nothing so much as a 
cool dark place where it might 
collapse in privacy. And Oliver, 
caught completely off guard, was 
too stunned by the suddenness of 
catastrophe to realize his own 
possible danger. 

What did happen was that 
Perrl - high - C - trill - and - A- above 
chose that particular moment to 
open her door again and look out. 

Her fortuitous timing altered 
the situation on the instant; the 
bear, bent only on escape and 
seeing comparative gloom beyond 
the door, charged not at Oliver 
but through the opening. And 
Oliver, still too confused to think 
past the necessity of retrieving his 
error, ran after it, brandishing his 
length of board and shouting 
wildly. 

rj^HE smaller area beyond the 
*■- partition was dimly lighted, 
but to judge by its straw-covered

floor and faint animal smell was 
evidently a special division of Mr. 
Fumay’s menagerie. The light 
was too dim and the emergency 
too great to permit Oliver more 
than a brief and incredulous 
glimpse of the improbable beast 
placidly munching hay in a 
corner; his whole attention was 
centered first on the fleeing bear 
and then upon the prostrate form 
of Perrl -high - C -trill- and -A- 
above, who had been violently 
bowled over by the bear’s rush. 

“Pearl!” yelled Oliver, petrified 
with horror. 

The bear stood swaying upright 
over her, threshing its tufted fore- 
paws for balance and showing 
yellow tusks in a grimace that 
stemmed from drugged weakness 
but which passed quite credit- 
ably for a snarl of demoniac fury. 

Obviously something had to be 
done. Oliver, galvanized by the 
realization, came to the rescue 
with a promptness that amounted 
to reflex action. 

“Down, boy!" he said, and 
dealt the bear a sharp blow across 
the muzzle with his board. 

The bear dealt Oliver a round- 
house clout in return that 
stretched him half-conscious be- 
side Perrl -high -C -trill- and -A- 
above. Then, at precisely that 
moment of greatest dramatic im- 
pact, it shook its head dizzily and 
passed out cold. 

The girl scrambled up and 



knelt beside Oliver to listen to 
his heartbeat, found that he was 
alive and raised her voice in an 
urgent arpeggio that held in spite 
of its operatic timbre a distinct 
note of command. 

In answer to her call the great 
beast in the corner — built some- 
thing on the order of a hippopota- 
mus but with unorthodox varia- 
tions in that it boasted six legs 
to either side and was covered 
with close -curling, bright blue 
wool — trotted out of the shadows 
and scooped up the unconscious 
bear in its four powerful anterior 
arms. 

A word trom Perrl-high-C- 
trill-and-A-above sent it into the 
main menagerie quarters, where 
it stuffed the limp bear into its 
old cage and trotted back to its 
mistress with a look of adoring 
deference on its round face. 

The girl gave the creature 
a random trill of commenda- 
tion and, displaying surprising 
strength for one so slight, herself 
dragged the reviving Oliver back 
to the scene of his unfinished 
diagnosis. The order given her 
earlier by Mr. Furnay was not 
forgotten, however, for she did 
not linger. 

“Not handsome, no,” she mur- 
mured, locking the partition door 
behind her this time. “But O 
Personal Deity of Unmarried 
Maidens, such headlong brav- 
ery!”

/"OLIVER roused ten minutes 
later to find himself alone 
with a memory of nightmare and 
a sleeping bear that offered no 
resistance whatever when he tun- 
neled a quantity of tetrachlore- 
thylene down its throat. 

He was still alone an hour later 
— and still trying dizzily to sepa- 
rate fact from fancy, having tried 
the partition door and found it 
locked — when the bear returned 
to semi -consciousness and sub- 
mitted groggily to a follow-up 
dosage of purgative. 

Oliver would have liked to stay 
long enough to learn the results 
of his diagnosis and to see Perrl- 
high-C-trill-and-A-above if she 
should reappear, but a glance at 
his watch electrified him with the 
realization that he had been away 
from his clinic for more than two 
hours and that his Aunt Katisha 
and Glenna might by now have 
the state police beating the pal- 
metto flats for his body. Accord- 
ingly he left the Fur nay estate in 
a great hurry, pausing at the gate 
only long enough to leave word 
for Mr. Furnay that he would 
ring later in the evening to check 
his patient’s progress. 

It was not until he had returned 
home and found his Aunt Katisha 
still out that his overworked 
nerves, punished outrageously by 
shock^ violence and confusion, 
composed themselves enough to 
permit him a reasonable guess as 



to what actually had happened — 
and by that time his conclusions 
had, taken a turn so fantastically 
improbable that he was lost again 
in a hopeless muddle of surmise. 

He poured himself a glass of 
milk in the kitchen (he pre- 
ferred coffee, but his Aunt Ka- 
tisha frowned on the habit) and 
took his grisly suspicions down 
to the clinic, where he felt more 
at ease than in the antimacas- 
sared austerity of the house. 
There he mulled them over 
again, and time was able to 
weave into the pattern the dis- 
jointed impressions carried over 
from his period of semi -conscious- 
ness and dismissed until now as 
nightmare figments from the de- 
lirium of shock. Their alignment 
with other evidence increased his 
conviction : 

Mr. Furnay and Manage, 
Oliver concluded with a cold 
thrill of horror, were not human 
beings at all but monsters. 

npHE pattern became even more 
disturbing when he considered 
various stories of local saucer- 
sightings and fireballs, which 
linked themselves with chilling 
germanity to the events of the 
day. 

First there had been Champ's 
instant distrust of Mr. Furnay 
and Bivins, and his attempt to 
route them for the aliens they 
were. There had been Bivins’

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




anomalous scream when bitten — 
a raucous sound certainly not 
human — and Mr. Furnay’s grit- 
tily inconsonant order, spoken in 
no identifiable earthly tongue. 
The isolation of the Furnay estate 
took on a sinister and significant 
logic, as did its understaffed con- 
dition; there was the evident but 
baffling reluctance of Mr. Furnay 
and his myrmidons (with the not- 
able exception of the golden- 
voiced Pearl) to approach even 
safely caged beasts, and the 
greater mystery of why a man so 
terrified of wild animals should 
have bought a menagerie in the 
first place. 

Considering the part played by 
Perrl-high-C-trill-and-A-above in 
a scheme of things so fantastic 
left Oliver more disturbed than 
ever, but for a different reason. 
That she was unarguably as alien 
as the others made her equally 
mysterious, but connoted no share 
in whatever devious plot occupied 
the Furnay faction; a reexamina- 
tion of Mr. Furnay’s harshly dic- 
tatorial attitude toward her, 
coupled with Oliver’s own uncer- 
tain memory of the moment 
when the girl had come to his 
rescue, convinced him that she 
was not ipso facto a member of 
the extraterrestrial cabal but was 
its prisoner instead. 

Visualizing the probable fate 
of a beautiful girl held captive by 
aliens — and forced by them to 



train outlandish, half-remem- 
bered brutes like the one behind 
the partition — rather strained 
Oliver’s talent for surmise, but at 
the same time moved him to the 
uneasy conviction that it was his 
duty to rescue her in turn. 

The thought that he might al- 
ready be too late appalled him. 
The slender blonde beauty of 
Perrl - high - C - trill - and - A- above 
was distractingly fresh in his 
mind, the eager arpeggiation of 
her voice an indelible memory. 
Recalling the smile she had given 
him in parting stirred an internal 
warmth unguessed at before, an 
emotional ignition certainly never 
kindled by his fiancee or family. 

O RELLA Simms, Glenna, his 
Aunt Katisha! 

Thought of his obligations 
brought him back to reality with 
a jar; the appalling gulf between 
fact and fancy made clear to him 
with sudden and shocking clarity 
the nonentity’s role that had been 
played, and must be played, all 
his life by Oliver Watts. 

He was the perennial romantic 
introvert, dreaming impossible 
dreams compounded of escape 
reading and frustration, grasping 
timorously at any thread of ad- 
venture that might lead him to 
forget for the moment the drab 
monotone of his existence. His 
mouth twisted wryly. There was, 
of course, no fantastic alien plot

incubating on the Furnay estate, 
no sunsuited damsel in distress 
awaiting rescue at his inept 
hands. He’d imagined the roman- 
tic aspects of the episode— the 
“unearthly” tongue, the improb- 
able beast. No one required, or 
ever would require, anything of 
Oliver Watts except his Aunt 
Katisha and Glenna, who de- 
manded obedience, and Orella 
Simms, who expected conformity. 

As if on cue, the Watts family 
car swung off the highway and 
rolled down the crushed shell 
driveway past the clinic. Oliver’s 
Aunt Katisha got out, leaving 
Glenna and Orella Simms to 
wait, and strode into the clinic 
office. 

“I see you’ve managed to spoil 
another one,” she said acidly, 
pausing long enough to retrieve 
the handkerchief Mr. Furnay ’s 
chauffeur had lost earlier. “More- 
over, 1 called twice this after- 
noon and found you gone. 
Where?” 

Oliver, as usual, weathered the 
storm in silence. Somewhere 
near the end he managed to 
squeeze in the information that 
he had treated a sick animal at 
the Furnay place — a saddle horse, 
he said, lying automatically as 
the lesser of two evils. 

His aunt Katisha, her inquisi- 
torial duty discharged, dropped 
the discolored handkerchief point- 
edly on Oliver’s desk and rejoined 



Glenna and Orella Simms. The 
car drove away. Oliver, left alone 
in the growing dusk of evening 
to his miserable introspection, 
found his wandering attention 
returning unaccountably to the 
crumpled handkerchief, and drew 
it closer for a better look. 

It was only a harmless square 
of linen, smudged with dust and 
spotted with blood from Bivins’ 
chow-bitten leg— -but with his 
closer look Oliver’s world sprang 
up and exploded with a shatter- 
ing bang in his startled face. 

The dust was quite ordinary, 
but Bivins’ blood was not. 

It was green. 

He was never quite sure, later, 
just what happened next. He re- 
tained a vague memory of roar- 
ing away in his Aunt Katisha’s 
car through a reckless showering 
of crushed shell; sometimes he 
could recall the cool onrush of 
wind whipping his face and the 
frantic dodging of approaching 
headlamps on the highway. But 
in the main, his descent upon the 
Fumay estate was a blank. 

Only one fact stood out with 
freezing clarity, excluding any 
thought of his Aunt Katisha’s 
certain wrath or of Orella’ s 
maidenly reproaches: Perrl-high- 
C-trill-and-A-above was in Dead- 
ly Danger, and there was none 
but Oliver Watts to rescue her. 

There was a brief instant of 
lucidity as he approached the

Fumay gates through the cab- 
bage palms and was forced to 
choose a course of action. 

The attendant certainly would 
not admit him without orders 
from Mr. Furnay, who as cer- 
tainly would not give them; the 
walls were much too high and 
sheer for climbing; and to make 
the need for haste even more 
critical, it was only too obvious 
that the Furnay gang was about 
to depart. 

A tremendous saucer-shaped 
ship had landed by the menagerie 
building, where it sat with circu- 
lar peripheral ports aglow and 
lines of bold enigmatic hiero- 
glyphs fluorescing greenly on its 
smooth undersurface. Jointed 
metal figures scurried here and 
there, chivvying the last of Mr. 
Furnay’s herbivores up a ramp 
into the belly of the ship; the 
predators, in cages drawn by 
other sleek robot stevedores, fol- 
lowed in orderly procession. 

Oliver solved his problem 
of entry by driving headlong 
through the iron grillwork. 

There was a raucous yelling 
from the gateman, a monstrous 
rending of metal and jangling of 
broken glass. Aunt Katisha’s car 
slewed erratically down the Fur- 
nay drive, turned over twice and 
pitched Oliver out, stunned for 
the second time that day, into the 
greenish glow shed by the saucer- 
ship’s lights. 



H E struggled back to awareness 
to find his head pillowed on 
something soft and wonderfully 
comfortable. A circle of startled 
faces, most of them dark fac- 
similes of the putteed Bivins’, 
stared uncertainly down at him. 
In the near foreground stood Mr. 
Furnay, wringing his hands and 
muttering grittily to himself in his 
own dissonant tongue. Mr. Fur- 
nay, seen now for the first time 
without his too-large Panama, ex- 
hibited instead of hair a crest of 
downy blue feathers and pronged 
antennae that vibrated softly in 
the evening breeze. 

“Where is she?” Oliver de- 
manded. He scrambled dizzily to 
his feet, and the circle of faces 
melted backward hastily. “What 
have you done with Pearl, you 
monsters?” 

Perrl - high - C - trill - and - A - 
above, on whose lap Oliver’s head 
had been pillowed, stood up to 
move between Oliver and the 
patently apprehensive Mr. Fur- 
nay. She wore a light maroon 
cape over her sunsuit against the 
mild chill of evening, and could 
not possibly have looked less like 
a damsel in distress. She seemed, 
as a matter of fact, quite happy. 

“I hoped you would come to 
see me again before blastoff,” she 
said. Her voice skipped, tinkling 
with pleasure, from octave to oc- 
tave. “But so suddenly — so dash- 
ing, so impetuous!”

“You're going away willingly ? H 
Oliver said dumbly. “Then 
they’re not forcing — you’re not a 
prisoner after all?” 

Her laugh was an arpeggiando 
blending of surprise and amuse- 
ment “A prisoner of these Tsam - 
mai? No. I am a performer in 
their company, hired by Xtll — 
Mr. Furnay — to train and exhibit 
animals native to my own world.” 
“But I heard Furnay threaten 
you in the menagerie building 
this afternoon! His tone — ” 

“The Tsammai tongue sounds 
dreadful because it is all con- 
sonants and not based on pitch 
and nuance as mine is,” she said. 
“But the Tsammai themselves 
are only tradesmen, and are very 
gentle. Xtll — Mr. Furnay — only 
feared that I might say too much 
to you then, when it was import- 
ant that the natives should not 
suspect our identity,” 

“It is true,” Mr. Furnay 
nodded, sounding relieved. “We 
must avoid notice on such worlds 
as yours, which are too backward 
to appreciate the marvels of our 
show. We stop here only to scout 
for new and novel exhibits.” 
“Show!” Oliver echoed. “You 
mean all this is — is — ” 

“What else?” asked Mr. Fur- 
nay. He pointed with his 
antennae to the fluorescent hiero- 
glyphs on the undersurface of the 
saucer-ship. “See, in our lingua 
galactica it reads : SKRRFF 



BROTHERS’ INTERSTELLAR 
CIRCUS, THE GALAXY’S 
GREATEST. It is the best on the 
circuit.” 

He indicated the circle of iden- 
tical Bivinsey, “These are the 
Skrrff brothers, our owners. I, 
sir, am business manager.” 

“But not always a good one,” 
one of the brothers said pointedly. 
“This time he has bought an 
entire menagerie of such fierce- 
ness that our trainers cannot ex- 
hibit it. It will have to be sold to 
some frontier -planet too, and our 
loss will be staggering.” 

It was left for Perrl-high-C- 
trill-and-A-above to deal with the 
problem, which she did with uni- 
versal feminine practicality. 

“Oliver made your bear well,” 
she pointed out. “And he is afraid 
of nothing — nothing! Could he 
not train his own fierce beasts as 
well as I train my gentle ones?” 
Oliver said, “Huh?” 

The Skrrff brothers, of course, 
implored Oliver on the spot to 
join them at any salary. 

Perrl - high - C - trill - and - A -

taves and for all the world to 
hear; “And I’m lonely, Oliver!”

Remarkable as they ore, the Pyramids cannot compare with the Incan 
Road as a feat of ancient engineering. The road reaches from Ecuador to 
Central Chile, a distance of 4,000 miles over the giant mountains and great 
canyons of the Andes, crossing swift rivers, deserts and swamps. Twenty-five 
feet wide, it rises by easy grades from valley to peak and down again, 
slashing through rock barriers, supported by immense retaining walls, across 
causeways as high as modern dams over deep ravines, spanning torrents 
with magnificently anchored suspension bridges whose enormously thick 
cables were spun of wool and fiber, tunneling through cliffs for astonishing 
distances. 

With its many side roads from the sea to the jungle, the mighty Incan 
Road totals fully 10,000 miles— yet, by flare and mirror signals, messages 
could be sent its entire length in four hours! Fish caught in the Pacific were 
eaten 300 miles awqy only 24 hours later— the railroad covering the same 
distance now takes ten hours more! 

Most incredible of all, not a single vehicle ever traveled the ancient 
road, for the Incas never invented the wheel!

crime may bring about demands 
for an indemnity to the Outer 
Worlds , and may also hasten the 
gradual replacement of the hu- 
man members of the Police De-

Allowing R. Daneel to solve the 
crime would be equally disas- 
trous. In either case, Baley fears 
“declassification” — the loss of all 
special privileges, and reduction 
to bare existence in the slum lev- 
els of the City. He fears this des- 
perately, since his father was 
declassified and Baley remem- 
bers bitterly his resultant un- 
happy and poverty-stricken 
childhood. 

Baley brings R. Daneel to his 
apartment. On the way there, 
they are brought face to face 
with a threatening anti-robot riot 
in the shoe department of a retail 
store. It is R. Daneel* s prompt 
action that averts the danger. 

At home, Baley ' s wife, Jessie,

character of the Biblical Jezebel, 
she no longer uses her full name.) 
Jessie and Bentley leave in order 
that the two men may have pri-

It is R . Daneel's theory that 
the murder is the work of the 
“Medievalists,” a group of Earth- 
men who advocate a return to 



Earth's ancient ways before the 
growth of the great “ caves of

sometimes known. Most Earth-

the murder in Spacetowh), leav- 
ing him almost helpless. 

Jessie returns unexpectedly and 
in great agitation. She has sus- 
pected that R. Daneel is a robot. 
When Baley confirms her guess , 
she is terrified that there may be 
ostracism or even outright anti- 
robot violence. She is right — if 
robots can be made so perfectly, 
nobody's job and status are safe 
any longer . 

The next morning, Baley asks 
for permission to travel to Space- 
town. The Spacers take compli- 
cated precautions to make certain 
he does nof bring in any infection 
with him. Inside Spacetown, 
Baley accuses the Spacers of hav- 
ing presented Earth with a false 
crime in order to make possible 
aggressive demands - He states 
that the apparent corpse, viewed 
by the Commissioner himself, 
was actually a cleverly designed 
robot, and that the pretended vic- 
tim, Dr. Sarton, was s till alive. 

He was, in fact, the so-called 
“robot” who masqueraded under 
the name of R. Daneel Olivaw!

CHAPTER VIII 



A FTER making his accusation, 
Baley was most conscious of 
the thud of his own ptilse. He 
seemed to be living in a moment 
of suspended time. R. Daneel's 
expression was, as always, un- 
readable. The Spacer, Dr. Han 
Fastolfe, wore a look of well- 
bred astonishment on his face. 

It was Commissioner Julius 
Enderby’s reaction that most 
concerned Baley. The trimensic 
receiver out of which his face 
stared did not allow perfect re- 
production. There was always 
that tiny flicker and that not- 
quite-ideal resolution. Through 
that imperfection and the further 
masking of the Commissioner’s 
spectacles, Enderby’s eyes were 
completely unreadable. 

Baley thought: Don’t go to 
pieces on me, Julius. I need you. 

He didn’t really think that 
Fastolfe would act in haste or 
under emotional impulse. He had 
read somewhere once that Spa- 
cers had no religion, but substi- 
tuted, instead, a cold and 
phlegmatic intellectual! sm raised 
to the heights of a philosophy. 
He believed that and counted on 
it. They would make a point of 
acting slowly and then only on 
the basis of reason. 

If he were alone among them 
and had said what he had said, 
he was certain that he would 



never have returned to the City. 
The Spacers’ plans were worth 
more to them, many times over, 
than the life of a City -dweller. 
Maybe they would present his 
corpse to the Commissioner, 
shake their heads and speak of 
an Earthman conspiracy having 
struck again. The Commissioner 
would believe them. If he hated 
Spacers, it was a hatred based 
on fear. He wouldn’t dare dis- 
believe them. 

That was why he had to be an 
actual witness of events — a wit- 
ness, moreover, safely out of 
reach of the Spacers’ calculated 
safety measures. 

rpHE Commissioner said chok- 
ingly, “Lije, you’re all wrong. 
I saw Dr. Sarton’s corpse.” 

“You saw the charred remnants 
of something you were told was 
Dr. Sarton’s corpse,” retorted 
Baley. He thought grimly of the 
Commissioner’s smashed glasses. 
That had been an unexpected 
break for the Spacers. 

“No, no, Lije. I knew Dr. Sar- 
ton well and his face was undam- 
aged.” The Commissioner put his 
hand to his glasses uneasily, as 
though he, too, remembered, and 
added, “I looked at him closely, 
very closely.” 

“How about this one. Commis- 
sioner?” asked Baley, pointing to 
R. Daneel again. “Doesn’t he 
resemble Dr. Sarton?” 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



101 




“Yes, the way a statue would.” 
“An expressionless attitude can 
be assumed, Commissioner. Sup- 
pose it was a robot you had seen 
blasted to death. You say you 
looked closely. Did you look 
closely enough to see whether the 
charred surface at the edge of 
the blast was really organic tis- 
sue or carbonization over fused 
metal?” 

The Commissioner looked re- 
volted. He said, “You’re being ri- 
diculous.” 

Baley turned to the Spacer. 
“Are you willing to have the body 
exhumed for examination?” 

Dr. Fastolfe smiled. “I would 
have no objection, Mr. Baley, but 
we do not bury our dead. Cre- 
mation is a universal custom 
among us.” 

“Very convenient.” 

“Tell me, Mr. Baley," said Dr. 
Fastolfe, “just how did you ar- 
rive at this very extraordinary 
conclusion of yours?” 

Baley thought: He isn’t giving 
up. He'll brazen it out, if he can. 

He said, “There’s more to imi- 
tating a robot than just putting 
on a frozen expression and adopt- 
ing a stilted style of conversation. 
The trouble with you men of the 
Outer Worlds is that you’re too 
used to robots. You’ve gotten to 
accept them almost as human be- 
ings. On Earth, we’re very con- 
scious of what a robot is. R. 
Daneel is too good a human to 



be a robot. My first impression 
of him was that he was a Spacer. 
It was quite an effort for me to 
adjust myself to his statement 
that he was a robot. And, of 
course, the reason for that was 
that he was a Spacer and wasn’t 
a robot.” 

R. Daneel interrupted without 
any sign of self-consciousness. 
"As I told you, partner Elijah, I 
was designed to take a temporary 
place in a human society. The re- 
semblance to humanity is pur- 
poseful.” 

“Even,” asked Baley, “down 
to the painstaking duplication of 
organs which, in a robot, would 
have no conceivable function?” 

Enderby demanded suddenly, 
“How did you find that out?” 

Baley reddened. “I couldn’t 
help noticing in the — in the Per- 
sonal.” 

Enderby looked shocked. 

F ASTOLFE said, “Surely you 
understand that a resemblance 
must be complete if it is to be 
useful. For our purposes, half- 
measures are as bad as none at 
all.” 

Baley asked abruptly, “May I 
smoke?” 

Three pipefuls in one day was 
a ridiculous extravagance, but he 
was riding a rolling torrent of 
recklessness and needed the re- 
lease of tobacco. After all, he was 
talking back to Spacers. He was 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




going to force their lies down 
their own throat. 

Fastolfe said, “I’m sorry, but 
I’d prefer that you didn’t.” 

It was a “preference” that had 
the force of a command. Baley 
felt that. Of course, he thought 
angrily, Enderby didn’t warn me 
because he doesn’t smoke himself, 
but it follows. They don’t smoke 
on their hygienic Outer Worlds, 
or drink, or have any human 
vices. No wonder they accept ro- 
bots in their damned — what did 
R. Daneel call it? — C/Fe society. 
No wonder R. Daneel can play 
the robot as well as he does. 
They’re all robots to begin with. 

He said, “The too -complete 
resemblance is just one point out 
of many. There was a near-riot 
in my section as I was taking 
him home.” He had to point. He 
could bring himself neither to 
say “R. Daneel” nor “Dr. Sar- 
ton” aloud. “He was the one who 
stopped the trouble and he did it 
by pointing a blaster at the po- 
tential rioters.” 

“Good Lord!” said Enderby. 
“The report stated that it was 
you — ” 

“I know, Commissioner. The 
report was based on information 
that I gave. I didn’t want to have 
it on the record that a robot had 
threatened to blast men and wo- 
men." 

“No, no, of course not.” Ender- 
by was visibly horrified. He lean- 



ed forward to look at something 
out of range of the trimensic re- 
ceiver. Baley could guess what 
it was. The Commissioner was 
checking the power gauge to see 
if the transmitter was being tap- 
ped. 

“Is that a point in your argu- 
ment?” asked Fastolfe. 

“It certainly is. The First Law 
of Robotics states that a robot 
cannot harm a human being.” 
“But R. Daneel did no harm.” 
“True. He even stated after- 
ward that he wouldn’t have fired 
under any circumstances. Still, 
no robot I ever heard of could 
have violated the spirit of the 
First Law by threatening to blast 
a human crowd, even if he had 
no intention to do so.” 

“I see. Are you a robotics ex- 
pert, Mr. Baley?” 

“No, sir. But I’ve had a course 
in general robotics and in posi- 
tronjc analysis." 

“Very nice," said Fastolfe 
agreeably, “but, you see, I am a 
robotics expert, and I assure you 
that the essence of the robot mind 
lies in a completely literal inter- 
pretation of the Universe. It rec- 
ognizes no spirit in the First Law, 
only the letter. The simple mod- 
els you have on Earth may be 
incapable of threatening a hu- 
man. An advanced model such as 
R. Daneel is another’ matter. If 
I gather the situation correctly, 
Daneel’s threat was necessary to 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



103 




prevent a riot. It was intended 
then to prevent harm to human 
beings. He was obeying the First 
Law, not defying it.” 

TJALEY squirmed inwardly, 
but maintained a tight ex- 
ternal calm. Hard as it would be, 
he would match this Spacer at 
his own game. 

He said, “You may counter 
each point separately, but they 
add up just the same. Last eve- 
ning, in our discussion of the so- 
called murder, this alleged robot 
claimed that he had been con- 
verted into a detective by the in- 
stallation of a new drive into his 
positronic circuits. A drive for 
justice.” 

“I’ll vouch for that,” said Fas- 
tolfe. “It was done to him three 
days ago under my own super- 
vision.” 

“A drive for justice? Justice, 
Dr. Fastolfe, is an abstraction. 
Only a human being can use the 
term.” 

“If you define ‘justice’ in such 
a way that it is an abstraction, if 
you sa"y that it is the rendering of 
each man his due, that it is ad- 
hering to the right, or anything 
of the sort, I grant you your ar- 
gument, Mr. Baley. A human 
understanding of abstractions 
cannot as yet be built into a posi- 
tronic brain,”. 

“You admit that, then — as an 
expert in robotics?” 



“Certainly. The question is, 
what did R. Daneel mean by us- 
ing the term ‘justice?’ ” 

“From the context of our con- 
versation, he meant what you and 
I and any human being would 
mean, but what no robot could 
mean.” 

“Why don’t you ask him to de- 
fine the term?” 

Baley turned to R. Daneel. 
“What is your definition of jus- 
tice?” 

“Justice is that which exists 
when all laws are enforced.” 
Fastolfe nodded. “A good defi- 
nition for a robot, Mr. Baley. 
Justice is a very concrete term to 
him since it is based on law en- 
forcement, which is in turn based 
upon the existence of specific and 
definite laws. There is nothi/ig 
abstract about it. A human being 
can recognize the fact that, on 
the basis of an abstract moral 
code, some laws may be bad ones 
and their enforcement unjust. 
What do you say, R. Daneel?” 
“An unjust law,” said R, Dan- 
eel, “is a contradiction in terms.” 
“To a robot it is, Mr. Baley. 
As you can see, you mustn’t 
confuse your justice and R. 
Daneel’s.” 

Baley faced R. Daneel sharply 
and said, “You left my apart- 
ment last night,” 

R. Daneel replied, “I did. If 
my leaving disturbed your sleep, 
I am sorry.” 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Where did you go?” 

“To the Men’s Personal.” 

For a moment, Baley was stag- 
gered. It was the answer he had 
already decided was the truth, 
but he had not expected it to be 
the answer R. Daneel would give. 
He felt a little of his certainty 
oozing away. The Commissioner 
was watching, his lensed eyes 
flickering from one to the other 
as they spoke. Baley couldn't 
back down now, no matter what 
sophistries they used against him. 

He said, “On reaching my sec- 
tion, he insisted on entering the 
Personal with me. His excuse was 
a poor one. During the night, he 
left to visit Personal again, as he 
has just admitted. If he were a 
man, I’d say he had every reason 
and right to do so. Obviously. 
As a robot, however, the trip was 
purposeless. The conclusion can 
only be that he is a man.” 

F ASTOLFE nodded, seeming 
not in the least put out. “This 
is most interesting. Suppose we 
ask Daneel why he made his trip 
to the Personal last night.” 
Commissioner Enderby leaned 
forward. “Please, Dr. Fastolfe, 
it is not proper to — ” 

“You need not be concerned. 
Commissioner,” said Fastolfe, his 
thin lips curving back in some- 
thing that looked like a smile, but 
wasn’t. “I am certain that Dan- 
eel’s answer will not offend your 



sensibilities or those of Mr. Bal- 
ey. Won’t you tell us, Daneel?” 

R. Daneel said, “Elijah’s wife, 
Jessie, left the apartment last 
night on friendly terms with me. 
It was apparent that she had no 
reason for thinking me to be oth- 
er than human. She returned to 
the apartment knowing I was a 
robot. Quite evidently, the in- 
formation to that effect exists 
outside the apartment. It follow- 
ed that my conversation with 
Elijah last night had been over- 
heard. In no other way could the 
secret of my true nature have be- 
come common knowledge. 

“Elijah told me that the apart- 
ments were well-insulated. Fur- 
thermore, we spoke together in 
low voices. Elijah is known as a 
policeman. If a conspiracy exists 
within the City sufficiently well- 
organized to have planned the 
murder of Dr. Sarton, it may well 
have been aware that Elijah had 
been placed in charge of the mur- 
der investigation. It would fall 
within the realm of possibility 
then, even of probability, that his 
apartment had been spy-beamed. 

“I searched the apartment as 
well as I could after Elijah and 
Jessie had gone to bed, but 
could find no transmitter. This 
complicated matters. A focused 
duo -beam could do the trick even 
in the absence of a transmitter, 
but that requires rather elaborate 
equipment. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL

Dr. Fastolfe said, “Well, Mr. 
Baley, does this sound reason- 
able to you?” 

"DALEY'S uncertainty was gone 
now. He said, “Reasonable as 
far as it goes, perhaps, but it 
stops short of perfection by a hell 
of a way. What he doesn't know 
is that my wife told me where 
she got the information and 
when. She learned he was a robot 
shortly after she left the house. 
Even then, the rumor had been 
circulating for hours. So the fact 
that he was a robot could not 
have leaked out through spying 
on our last evening’s conversa- 
tion.” 

“Nevertheless,” said Dr. Fas- 



106 




dered man. You are shown the 
corpse of something supposed to 
be human, but the corpse has 
since been disposed of and is not 
available for close examination. 

“The Spacers insist an Earth- 
man did the killing, even though 
the only way they can make such 
an accusation stick is to suppose 
that a City man had left the City 
and cut cross-country to Space- 
town alone and at night. You 
know damn well how unlikely 
that is. 

“Next they send a supposed 
robot into the City; in fact, they 
insist on sending him. The first 
thing the robot does is to threaten 
a crowd of human beings with a 
blaster. The second is to set in 
motion the rumor that there is 
ii Spacer robot in the City. The 
rumor is so specific that Jessie 
told me it was known that he was 
working with the police. That 
means that before long it will be 
known that it was the robot who 
handled the blaster. Maybe even 
now, the rumor is spreading 
across the yeast vat country and 
down the Long Island hydroponic 
plants that there’s a killer robot 
on the loose.” 

“This is impossible? Impossi- 
ble !” groaned Enderby. 

“It’s exactly what’s happening, 
Commissioner, Don’t you see it? 
There’s a conspiracy in the City, 
nil right, but it’s run from Space- 
town. The Spacers want to be 



able to report a murder. They 
want riots. They want an assault 
on Spacetown. The worse things 
get, the better the incident Then 
Spacer ships can come down and 
occupy the Cities of Earth.” 

T\R. FASTOLFE said mildly, 
"We had an excuse to do just 
that during the Barrier riots of 
twenty-five years ago.” 

“You weren't ready then. You 
are now.” Daley’s heart was 
pounding madly. 

"This is quite a complicated 
plot you’re attributing to us, Mr. 
Raley. If we wanted to occupy 
Earth, we could do so in much 
simpler fashion.” 

"Maybe not. Dr. Fastolfe. Your 
so-called robot told me that pub- 
lic opinion about Earth is by no 
means unified on your Outer 
Worlds. I think he was telling the 
truth at that time, anyway. May- 
be an outright occupation would 
not sit well with the people at 
home. Maybe an incident is an 
absolute necessity. A good shock- 
ing incident.” 

“Like a murder, eh? Is that it? 
You’ll admit it would have to be 
a pretended murder. You won’t 
suggest, I hope, that we’d really 
kill one of ourselves for the sake 
of an incident.” 

“You built a robot to look like 
Dr. Sarton, blasted the robot, 
and showed the remains to Com- 
missioner Enderby.” 



THE CAVES OF 5 TEE l 



107 




“And then,” said Dr. Fastolfe, 
“having used R. Daneel to im- 
pe«onate Dr. Sarton in the false 
murder, we have to use Dr. Sar- 
ton to impersonate R. Daneel in 
the false investigation of the false 
murder.” 

“Exactly. I am telling you this 
in the presence of a witness who 
is not here in the flesh and whom 
you cannot blast out of existence 
and who is important enough to 
be believed by the City govern- 
ment and by Washington itself. 
We will be prepared for you and 
we know what your intentions 
are. If necessary, our government 
will report directly to your peo- 
ple, expose the situation for ex- 
actly what it is. 1 doubt if this 
sort of interstellar trickery will 
be tolerated.” 

Fastolfe shook his head. “Real- 
ly, you have the most astonishing 
notions. Suppose now that R. 
Daneel is really R. Daneel, that 
he is actually a robot. Wouldn’t 
the corpse that Commissioner 
Enderby saw really be Dr. Sar- 
ton? It would be scarcely reason- 
able to believe that the corpse 
was still another robot. Commis- 
sioner Enderby witness R. Daneel 
under construction and can vouch 
for the fact only one existed.” 

“If it comes to that,” said Bal- 
ey stubbornly, “the Commission- 
er is not a robotics expert. You 
might have had a dozen such ro- 
bots.” 



“Stick to the point, Mr. Baley. '( 
What if R. Daneel is R. Daneel? 
Would you have any further 
basis for this completely melo- 
dramatic and implausible 
interstellar plot you have con-, 
structed?” 

“If he is a robot! I say he is 
human. I say no other conclusion 
is possible.” 

“Yet you haven’t investigated . 
the problem, Mr. Baley,” saidj 
Fastolfe. “To differentiate a ro- 
bot, even a very humanoid robot* 
from a human being, it isn’t, 
necessary to make elaborately 
shaky deductions from little 
things he says or does. For in 
stance, have you tried sticking 
pin into R. Daneel?” 



B ALEY’S mouth fell ope 
“What’s that?” 



** “What’s that?” 

“It’s a simple experiment 
There are others perhaps n 
quite so simple. His skin and h 
look real, but have you tried 
looking at them under adequate; 
magnification? Then again, h 
seems to breathe, particular! 
when he is using air to talk, bu 
have you noticed that his breath 
ing is irregular, that minutes ma 
go by during which he has ni 
breath at all? You might even 
have trapped some of his expired 
air and measured the carbon dij 
oxide content. You might ha 
tried to draw a sample of b! 

You might have tried to dete

a pulse in his wrist, or a heart- 
beat under his shirt. Do you see 
what I mean, Mr. Baley?” 

“That’s just talk,” said Baley 
uneasily. “I’m not going to be 
bluffed. I might have tried any 
of those things, but do you sup- 
pose this alleged robot would 
have let me use a hypodermic on 
him, or a stethoscope or a micro- 
scope?” 

“I see your point,” said Fss- 
tolfe. 

He looked at R. Daneel and 
gestured slightly, 

R. Daneel touched the cuff of 
his right shirt sleeve and the 
diamagnetic seam slipped open 
the entire length of his arm. A 
smooth, sinewy and entirely hu- 
man limb lay exposed. Its short 
bronze hairs, both in quantity 
and distribution, were exactly 
what one would expect of a hu- 
man being. 

Baley said, “So?” 

R. Daneel squeezed the ball of 
his right middle finger with the 
thumb and forefinger of his left 
hand. Just as the sleeve had 
separated when the diamagnetic 
field of its seam had been inter- 
rupted, so the arm itself opened 
along the center. 

Under a thin layer of fleshlike 
material was the dull blue -gray 
of stainless-steel rods, cords and 
joints. 

“Would you care to examine 
Daneel’s workings more closely, 



Mr. Baley?” asked Dr. Fastolfe 
politely. 

Baley could scarcely hear the 
remark for the buzzing in his 
ears and the Commissioner’s sud- 
den hysterical laughter. 

CHAPTER IX 

T HE minutes passed and the 
buzzing grew louder and 
drowned out the laughter. The 
Dome and everything it con- 
tained and Baley's time-sense all 
wavered. 

He found himself sitting in an 
unchanged position, but with a 
definite feeling of lost time. The 
Commissioner was gone; the tri- 
mensic receiver was milky and 
opaque; and R. Daneel sat at his 
side, pinching up the skin of 
Baley’s bared upper arm. Baley 
could see, just beneath the skin, 
the thin dark outline of a hypo- 
sliver. It vanished as he watched, 
spreading away into the inter- 
cellular fluid, from that into the 
bloodstream and the neighboring 
cells, and then into all the cells 
of his body. 

“Do you feel better, partner 
Elijah?” asked R. Daneel. 

Baley did. He rolled down his 
sleeve and looked about. Dr. 
Fastolfe sat where he had been, 
a small smile softening the home- 
liness of his face. 

“Did I black out?” Baley 
asked. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



109 




and all sorts of repercussions. 
The Spacers will demand your 
removal from the case and it’ll 
have to be that way. You under- 
stand that, don't you? But I’ll 
protect you as far as I can, Lije.” 

Baley knew that would be ex- 
actly true. The Commissioner 
would protect him, but only as 
far as he could — not to the point, 
for instance of infuriating an 
already angry Mayor. 

He could hear the Mayor, too. 
“Damn it, Enderby, who’s run- 
ning the City? Why was an un- 
authorized robot allowed inside? 
And just what the devil did this 
Baley-—” 

If it came to a decision be- 
tween Baley’s future in the De- 
partment and the Commissioner's 
own, what possible choice could 
Baley expect? He could find no 
reasonable way of blaming En- 
derby. 

The least he could expect was 
demotion and that was bad 
enough. The mere act of living in 
a modern City insured the bare 
possibility of existence, even for 
those entirely declassified. How 
bare that possibility was, he knew 
only too well. 

It was the addition of status 
that brought the little things: a 
more comfortable seat here, a 
better cut of meat there, a short- 
er wait in line at the other place. 
To the philosophical mind, these 
items might seem scarcely worth 

THE CAVES OF STEEL 



any great trouble to acquire. 

Yet no one, however philo- 
sophical, could give up those 
privileges, once acquired, with- 
out a pang. That was the point, 

What a trifling addition to the 
convenience of the apartment a 
wash-basin was when, for thirty 
years, the trip to Personals had 
been an automatic and unregard- 
ed one. How useless it was even 
as a device to prove “status” 
when it was considered the height 
of ill-form to parade “status.” 
Yet were the wash-basin to be 
removed, how humiliating and 
unbearable would each trip to 
Personals be! How yearningly at- 
tractive the memory of the bed- 
room shave! How filled with a 
sense of lost luxury! 

TT was fashionable . for modern 
political writers to look back 
with smug disapproval at the 
“Fiscalism” of Medieval times, 
when economy had been based 
on money. The competitive strug- 
gle for existence, they said, was 
brutal. No truly complex society 
could survive the eternal “fight- 
for the buck.” (Scholars had 
varying interpretations of the 
word “buck," but there was no 
dispute over the meaning as a 
whole.) 

By contrast, modern “Civism” 
was praised as efficient and en- 
lightened. 

Maybe so. There were histor- 

lll 




ical novels both in the romantic 
and the sensational tradition and 
the Medievalists thought “Fiscal- 
ism” had bred such things as in- 
dividualism and initiative, 

Baley wondered sickly if ever 
a man fought harder for that 
buck, whatever it was, than a 
City-dweller fought to keep from 
losing his Sunday night option on 
a chicken drumstick — a real- 
flesh drumstick from a once- 
living bird. 

Baley thought: Not me so 
much. There’s Jessie and Ben. 

Dr. Fastolfe’s voice broke in 
upon his thoughts. “Mr. Baley, 
do you hear me?” 

Baley blinked. “Yes?" How 
long had he been standing there 
like a frozen fool? 

“Won’t you sit down, sir? Hav- 
ing attended to the matter on 
your mind, you may now be in- 
terested in the films we took of 
the scene of the crime.” 

“No, thank you. I have busi- 
ness in the City.” 

“Surely the case of Dr. Sarton 
comes first.” 

“Not with me. I imagine I'm 
off the case already.” Suddenly, 
he boiled over. “Damn it, why 
didn’t you prove R. Daneel was 
a robot right away? Why did 
you let me make a fool of my- 
self?” 

“My dear Mr. Baley, I was in- 
terested in your deductions. As 
for your being off the case, I 

112 G 



made a special point of asking 
the Commissioner that you be re- 
tained. I believe he will co- 
operate,” 

Baley sat down, not entirely 
voluntarily. He said sharply, 
“Why?" 

Dr. Fastolfe crossed his legs 
and sighed. “Mr. Baley, in gen- 
eral I have met two kinds of 
City-dwellers, rioters and poli- 
ticians. Your Commissioner is 
useful to us, but he is a politician. 
He handles us, if you know what 
I mean. You came here and bold- 
ly accused us of tremendous 
crimes and tried to prove your 
case. I found it a hopeful de- 
velopment.” 

“How hopeful?” asked Baley 
sardonically. 

“Hopeful enough. You are" 
someone I can deal with frankly. 
Last night, Mr. Baley, R. Daneel 
reported to me by shielded sub- 
ether. Some things about you in- ' 
terested me very much. For 
instance, there was the point con- 
cerning the nature of the book-.; 
films in your apartment.” 

“What about them?” 

“A good many dealt with his- 
torical and archeological subjects. 
It makes it appear that you are 
interested in human society and 
that you know a little about its 
evolution.” 

“Even policemen can spend 
their free time on book-films, if 
they choose.” ,5

UITE,” agreed Dr. Fastolfe. 
“I'm glad of your choice of 
viewing matter. It will help me 
in what I am trying to do. In 
the first place, I want to explain, 
or try to, the exclusivism of the 
men of the Outer Worlds. We 
live here in Spacetown; we don’t 
enter the City; we mingle with 
you City -dwellers only in a very 
rigidly limited fashion. I sit here 
now with filters in my nostrils, 
gloves on my hands, and a fixed 
determination to come no closer 
to you than I can help. Why do 
you suppose that is?” 

Baley said, “There’s no point 
in guessing.” Let him talk now. 

“If you guessed as some of 
your people do, you would say 
that it was because we despised 
the men of Earth and refused to 
lose caste by allowing their shad- 
ow to fall upon us. That is not 
so. The medical examination you 
went through, as well as the 
cleansing procedures, were not 
matters of ritual. They were dic- 
tated by necessity.” 

“Disease?” 

“Yes, disease. The Earthmen 
who colonized the Outer Worlds 
found themselves on planets en- 
tirely free of terrestrial bacteria 
and viruses. They brought in 
their own, of course, but they 
also brought with them the lat- 
est medical and microbiological 
techniques. They had a small 
community of micro-organisms 



to deal with and no intermediate 
hosts, such as mosquitoes to 
spread malaria, snails to spread 
schistosomiasis. Disease agents 
were wiped out and symbiotic 
bacteria allowed to grow. The 
Outer Worlds became disease- 
free. Naturally, as time went on, 
entrance requirements for immi- 
grant Earthmen were made more 
and more rigorous, since less and 
less could the Outer Worlds re- 
sist disease.” 

“You’ve never been sick. Dr. 
Fastolfe?” 

“Not with a parasitic disease. 
We are all liable to degenerative 
diseases, but I have never had a 
cold. If I were to contract one, 
I might die of it, having built 
up no resistance to it whatsoever. 
Those of us who come here run 
a great risk. Earth is riddled with 
diseases to which we have no de- 
fense, no natural defense. You 
yourself are carrying the germs 
of almost every known disease. 
You are not aware of it, since 
you keep them under control at 
almost all times through the anti- 
bodies your body has developed 
over the years. We lack the anti- 
bodies. Do you wonder that I 
come no closer to you? Believe 
me, Mr. Baley, I act aloof only 
in self-defense.” 

Baley said, “If tflis is so, why 
isn’t the fact made known on 
Earth? I mean that it is not just 
queasiness on your part, but a 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



113 




defense against an actual phys- 
ical danger.’' 

The Spacer shook his head. 
“We are few. Mr. Baley, and are 
disliked as foreigners anyway. 
We maintain our own safety on 
the basis of a rather shaky pres- 
tige as a superior class of being. 
We cannot afford to lose face by 
admitting that we are afraid to 
approach an Earthman. Not, at 
least, until there is a better un- 
derstanding between Earthmen 
and Spacers.’' 

“There won’t be on the present 
terms. It’s your supposed su- 
periority that we — they hate you 
for." 

“It is a dilemma. Don’t think 
we aren’t aware of it.” 

“Does the Commissioner know 
of this?” 

“We have never explained it to 
him flatly, as I have just done 
to you. He may guess it, however. 
He is quite an intelligent man.” 

“If he guessed it, he might have 
told me,” Baley said reflectively. 

I~\R. Fastolfe lifted his eye- 
brows. “If he had, then you 
wouldn’t have considered the 
possibility of R. Daneel being a 
human Spacer. Is that it?” 

Baley shrugged slightly. 

But Dr. Fastolfe went on, 
“That’s quitfc true, you know. 
Putting the psychological diffi- 
culties to one side, the terrible 
effect of the noise and crowds 



upon us, the fact remains that 
for one of us to enter the City 
is the equivalent of a death sen- 
tence. It is why Dr. Sarton initi- 
ated his project of humanoid 
robots. They were substitute men, 
designed to enter the City instead 
of us — ” 

“R. Daneel explained it to me,” 
“Do you disapprove?” 

“Look,” said Baley, “since 
we’re talking to one another so 
freely, let me ask a question in 
simple words. Why have you 
Spacers come to Earth anyway? 
Why don’t you leave us alone?” 
Dr. Fastolfe said, with obvious 
surprise, “Are you satisfied with 
life on Earth?” 

“We get along.” 

“Yes, but how long will that 
continue? Your population goes 
up continuously ; the available 
calories meet the needs only as a 
result of greater and greater 
effort. Earth is up a blind alley.” 
“We get along,” Baley repeat- 
ed stubbornly. 

“Barely. A City like New York 
must spend every ounce of effort 
getting water in and waste out. 
The nuclear power plants are 
kept going by uranium supplies 
that are constantly more difficult 
to obtain even from the other 
planets of the Solar System, and 
the supply needed goes up stead- 
ily. The life of the City depends 
every moment on the arrival of 
wood-pulp for the yeast vats and 



114 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




minerals for the hydroponic 
plants. Air must be circulated un- 
ceasingly. The balance is a very 
delicate one in a hundred direc- 
tions, and growing more delicate 
each year. What would happen to 
New York if the tremendous flow 
of input and outgo were to be 
interrupted for even a single 
hour?” 

“It never has been,” Baley 
was on the defensive. 

“Which is no security for the 
future. In primitive times, in- 
dividual population centers were 
virtually self-supporting, living 
on the produce of neighboring 
farms. Nothing but immediate 
disaster, a flood or a pestilence 
or crop failure, could harm them. 
As the centers grew and tech- 
nology improved, localized dis- 
asters could be overcome by 
drawing on help from distant 
centers, but at the cost of making 
even larger areas interdependent. 
In Medieval times, the open 
cities, even the largest, could sub- 
sist on food stores and on emer- 
gency supplies of all sorts for a 
week at least. When New York 
first became a City, it could have 
lived on itself for a day. Now it 
cannot do so for an hour. A dis- 
aster that would have been un- 
comfortable ten thousand years 
ago and merely serious a thou- 
sand years ago and acute a hun- 
dred years ago would now be 
fatal,” 



T> ALEY moved restlessly in his 
chair. “I’ve heard all this be- 
fore. The Medievalists want an 
end to Cities. They want us to 
get back to the soil and to nat- 
ural agriculture. Well, they’re 
mad; we can't. There are too 
many of us and you can’t go 
backward in history, only for- 
ward. Of course, if emigration to 
the Outer Worlds were not re- 
stricted — ” 

“You know why it must be.” 
“Then we have to go on as we 
are.” 

“What about emigration to new 
worlds? There are a hundred bil- 
lion stars in the Galaxy. It is 
estimated that there are a hun- 
dred million planets that can be 
inhabited.” 

“That’s ridiculous.” 

“Why?” asked Dr. Fastolfe, 
with vehemence. “Why is the sug- 
gestion ridiculous? Thirty of the 
fifty Outer Worlds, including my 
native Aurora, were directly col- 
onized by Earthmen. Is coloniza- 
tion no longer possible?” 
“Well—” 

“If it is no longer possible, it 
is because of the development of 
City culture on Earth, Before 
the Cities, human life on Earth 
wasn’t so specialized that men 
couldn’t break loose and start all 
over on a raw world. They did it 
thirty times. But now Earthmen 
are so enwombed in their im- 
prisoning caves of steel that they 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



115 




dare not leave. You, Mr. Baley, 
won't even believe that a City- 
dweller is capable of crossing 
country to get to Spacetown. 
Crossing space to get to a new 
world must represent impossibil- 
ity squared to you. City civiliza- 
tion is ruining Earth!” 

Baley said angrily, “And if it 
does, how does that concern you 
people? It’s our problem.” 

“I know how you feel. It is not 
pleasant to listen to the preach- 
ing of a stranger. Yet I wish your 
people could preach to us for we, 
too, have a problem — one that is 
analogous to yours.” 

Baley smiled crookedly. “Over- 
population?” 

"Analogous, not identical. Ours 
is underpopulation. How old do 
you think I am?” 

The Earthman considered for 
a moment and then deliberately 
overestimated. “Sixty, I’d say.” 
"A hundred and sixty, you 
should say.” 

"What!” 

“A hundred and sixty -three 
next birthday, to be exact, and 
I’m using the standard Earth 
year as the unit. If I’m fortunate, 
if I take care of myself, most 
of all, if I catch no disease on 
Earth, I may double that age. 
People on Aurora have been 
known to live over three hundred 
and fifty years. And life expect- 
ancy is still increasing.” 

Baley looked to R. Daneel 



(who throughout the conversa- 
tion had been listening in stolid 
silence), as though he were seek- 
ing confirmation. 

H E said, “How is that pos- 
sible?” 

“In an underpopulated so- 
ciety,” replied Dr. Fastolfe, “it is 
practical to concentrate research 
on the aging process. In a world 
such as yours, a lengthened life 
expectancy would be disastrous. 
You couldn’t afford the resulting 
rise in population. On Aurora, 
there is room for tricentenarians. 
Then, of course, a long life be- 
comes doubly and triply precious. 
If you were to die now, you would 
lose perhaps forty years of your 
life, probably less. If I were to 
die, I would lose a hundred and 
fifty years, probably more. In a 
culture such as ours, then, in- 
dividual life is of prime import- 
ance. Our birth rate is low and 
population increase is rigidly 
controlled. We maintain a defi- 
nite robot man ratio designed to 
maintain the individual in the 
greatest comfort. Logically, de- 
veloping children are carefully 
screened for physical and mental 
defects before being allowed to 
mature.” 

Baley interrupted. “You mean 
you kill them if they don’t — ” 

“If they don’t measure up.. 
Quite painlessly, I assure you. 
The notion shocks you. But the' 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Earthman’s uncontrolled breed- 
ing shocks us just as much.” 

“We’re controlled, Dr. Fastolfe, 
Each family is allowed only so 
many children.” 

Dr. Fastolfe smiled tolerantly. 
“So many of any kind of chil- 
dren; not so many healthy chil- 
dren.” 

“Who’s to judge?" 

“That's rather complicated and 
not to be answered in a sentence. 
Some day we may talk it over.” 

“Well, where’s yout problem? 
You sound satisfied with your 
society.” 

“It is stable. That’s the trouble. 
It is too stable.” 

T>ALEY said, “Nothing pleases 
you. Our civilization is too 
close to the ragged edge of chaos, 
according to you, and your own 
isn’t close enough.” 

“It is possible to be too stable. 
No Outer World has colonized 
a new planet in two and a half 
centuries. There is no prospect for 
colonization in tlfe future. Our 
lives in the Outer Worlds are too 
long to risk and too comfortable 
to upset.” 

“You’ve come to Earth. You 
risk disease.” 

“There are some of us, Mr. 
Baley, who feel that the future 
of the human race is even worth 
the possible loss of an extended 
lifetime. Too few of us, I km 
sorry to say.” 



“All right, we’re coming to the 
point. How is Spacetown helping 
matters?” 

“In trying to introduce robots 
here on Earth, we’re doing our 
best to upset the balance of your 
City economy.” 

“That’s your way of helping?” 
Baley’s lips quivered. “You mean 
you’re creating a growing group 
of displaced and declassified men 
on purpose?” 

“Not out of cruelty or callous- 
ness, believe me. A group of dis- 
placed men, as you call them, are 
what we need to serve as a nu- 
cleus for colonization. Your 
ancient America was discovered 
by ships fitted out with men from 
the prisons. Don’t you see that 
the City ’3 womb has failed the 
displaced man? He has nothing 
to lose and worlds to gain by 
leaving Earth.” 

“But it isn’t working.” Baley 
frowned thoughtfully. 

“No, it isn’t,” said Dr. Fastolfe, 
sadly. “There is something 
wrong. The resentment of the 
Earthman for the robot blocks 
things. Yet those very robots can 
accompany humans, smooth the 
difficulties of initial adjustment 
to a raw world, make colonization 
practical.” 

“Then what? More Outer 
Worlds?” 

“No. The Outer Worlds were 
established before the Cities had 
spread over Earth. The new col- 



THE CAVE5 OF STEEL 



117 




onies will be built by humans 
who have the City background 
plus the beginnings of a C/Fe 
culture. It will be a synthesis. A 
carbon iron symbiosis. As it 
stands now. Earth’s .own struc- 
ture must go ricketing down in 
the near future, the Outer Worlds 
will slowly degenerate and decay 
in a somewhat further future, but 
the new colonies will be a new 
and healthy strain, combining 
the best of both cultures. By their 
reaction upon the older worlds, 
including Earth, we ourselves 
may gain new life.” 

“I don’t know. It’s all very 
vague, Dr. Fastolfe.” 

“A dream, yes, but a sharply 



detailed one. Think about it.” 
Abruptly the Spacer rose to his 
feet. “I have spent more time 
with you than I intended. In 
fact, more time than our health 
ordinances allow. You will ex- 
cuse me?” 

ITH R. Daneel, Baley left 
the dome. Sunlight, at a 
different angle, somewhat yellow- 
er, washed down upon them once 
again. Baley wondered uneasily 
whether sunlight might not seem 
different on another world. Less 
harsh and brazen, perhaps. More 
acceptable. 

Another world? The homely 
Spacer with the prominent ears 




118 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



had filled his mind with queer 
imaginings. Did the doctors of 
Aurora once look at the child 
Fastolfe and wonder if he ought 
to be allowed to mature? Wasn’t 
he too ugly? Or did their criteria 
include physical appearance at 
all? When did ugliness become a 
deformity and what deformi- 
ties — 

But when the sunlight van- 
ished and they entered the first 
door that led to the Personal, 
the mood became harder to main- 
tain. 

Baley shook his head with ex- 
asperation. Forcing Earthmen to 
emigrate, to set up a new so- 
ciety! It was nonsense! What 
were these Spacers really after? 

He thought about it and came 
to no conclusion. 

Slowly, their squad -car rolled 
down the vehicular lane. Reality 
was surging all about Baley. His 
blaster was a warm and comfort- 
able weight against his hip. The 
noise and vibrant life of the City 
were just as warm, just as com- 
fortable. 

For a moment, as the City 
closed in, his nose tingled to a 
slight and fugitive pungence. 

He thought wonderingly: The 
City smells, 

He thought of the twenty mil- 
lion human beings crammed into 
the steel walls of the great cave 
and for the first time in his life 
he smelled them with nostrils that 



had been washed clean by out- 
door air. 

He thought; Would it be dif- 
ferent on another world? Less 
people and more air — cleaner? 

But the afternoon roar of the 
City was all around them, the 
smell faded and was gone and 
he felt a little ashamed of him- 
self. 

He let the drive-rod in slowly 
and tapped a larger share of the 
beamed power. The squad-car 
accelerated sharply as it slanted 
down into the empty Motor- 
way. 

“Daneel,” he said. 

“Yes, Elijah?” 

“Why was Dr. Fastolfe telling 
me all that?” 

“We are not here just to solve 
a murder, but to save Spacetown 
and, with it, the future of the 
human race.” 

Baley said drily, “I think he’d 
have been better off if he’d let 
me see the scene of the crime 
and interview the men who first 
found the body.” 

“I doubt if you could have 
added anything, Elijah. We have 
been quite thorough.” 

“Have you? You’ve got noth- 
ing. Not a clue. Not a suspect.” 

“No, you are right. The an- 
swer must be in the City. To be 
accurate, though, we did have one 
suspect,” 

“What? You said nothing of 
this before.” 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



119 




"I did not feel it to be neces- 
sary, Elijah. Surely it is obvious 
to you that one suspect auto- 
matically existed.” 

“In the devil’s name, who?" 

“The one Earthman who was 
on the scene. Commissioner 
Julius Enderby.” 

CHAPTER X 

rpHE squad-car veered to one 
side, halted against the con- 
crete wall of the Motorway. With 
the humming of its motor stop- 
ped, the silence was dead and 
thick. 

Baley looked at the robot next 
to him and asked in an incongru- 
ously quiet voice, “What did you 
say?” 

Time stretched while Baley 
waited for an answer. A small 
and lonesome vibration rose and 
reached a minor peak, then faded. 
It was the sound of another 
squad-car, boring its way past 
them on some unknown errand, 
perhaps a mile away. Or else it 
was a fire-car hurrying along to- 
ward its own appointment with 
combustion. 

A detached portion of Baley’s 
mind wondered if any one man 
any longer knew all the Motor- 
ways that twisted about in New 
York City’s bowels. At no time 
in the day or night could the 
entire Motorway system be com- 
pletely empty, and yet there must 



be individual passages that no 
man had entered in years. With 
sudden, devastating clarity, he 
remeirfbered a short story he had 
viewed as a youngster. 

It concerned the Motorways of 
London and began, quietly 
enough, with a murder. The mur- 
derer fled toward a prearranged 
hideout in the comer of a Motor- 
way in whose dust his own shoe- 
prints had been the only 
disturbance for a century. In that 
abandoned hole, he could wait in 
complete safety till the search 
died. 

But he took a wrong turning 
and in the silence and loneness 
of those twisting corridors he 
swore a blaspheming oath that 
he would yet reach his haven. 

From that time on, no turning 
was right. He wandered through 
an unending maze from the 
Brighton sector on the Channel 
to Norwich and from Coventry to 
Canterbury. He burrowed end- 
lessly beneath the great City of 
London from end to end of its 
sprawl across the southeastern 
corner of Medieval England. His 
clothes were rags and his shoes 
ribbons, his strength wore down 
but never left him. He was tired, 
tired, yet unable to stop. 

Sometimes he heard the sound 
of passing cars, but they were 
always in the next corridor, and 
however fast he rushed (for he 
would gladly have given himself 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




up by then), the corridors he 
reached were always empty. 
Sometimes he saw an exit far 
ahead that would lead to the 
City’s life and breath, but it al- 
ways glimmered farther away as 
he approached until he would 
turn — and it would be gone. 

Occasionally, Londoners on 
official business through the un- 
derground would see a misty fig- 
ure limping silently toward them, 
a semi-transparent arm lifted in 
pleading, a mouth open and mov- 
ing, but soundless. As it ap- 
proached, it would waver and 
vanish. 

It was a story that had lost 
the attributes of ordinary fiction 
and had entered the realm of 
folklore. The “Wandering Lon- 
doner” had become a familiar 
phrase to all the world. 

In the depths of New York 
City, Baley remembered the 
story and stirred uneasily. 

R DANEEL spoke aitd there 
• was a small echo to his 
voice. He said, ‘‘We may be over- 
heard.” 

“Down here? Not a chance. 
Now what was that you said 
about the Commissioner?” 

“He was on the scene, Elijah- 
He is a City-dweller. He was 
inevitably a suspect.” 

“Was? You mean he isn’t a 
suspect now?” 

“His innocence was quickly 



established. For one thing, there 
was no blaster in his possession. 
There could not very well be one. 
He had entered Spacetown in the 
usual fashion and you know 
blasters are removed as a matter 
of course.” 

“Was the murder weapon 
found at all?” 

“No, Elijah. Every blaster in 
Spacetown was examined and 
none had been fired for weeks.” 
“Then whoever had committed 
the murder had either hidden the 
weapon so well — ” 

“It could not have been hidden 
anywhere in Spacetown.” 

Baley said impatiently, “I'm 
trying to consider all possibilities. 
It was either hidden or it was 
carried away ,by the murderer 
when he left.” 

“Exactly.” 

“And if you admit only the 
second possibility, then the Com- 
missioner is cleared.” 

“Yes. As a precaution, of 
course, he was cerebroanalyzed.” 
“He was what?” 

“The interpretation of the elec- 
tromagnetic fields of the living 
brain cells.” 

“Oh,” said Baley, unenlight- 
ened. “And what does that tell 
you?” 

“It gives us information con- 
cerning the temperamental and 
emotional makeup of an individ- 
ual. In the case of Commissioner 
Enderby, it told us that he was 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



121 




incapable of killing Dr. Sarton.” 
“I could have told you that.” 
“It is better to have objective 
information. Naturally, our peo- 
ple in Spacetown allowed them- 
selves to be cere bro analyzed as 
well.” 

“All incapable, I suppose.” 
“Beyond question. That is why 
we know that the murderer must 
be a City-dweller ” ' 

“Well, then, all we have to do 
is put the whole City through 
your cute little process.” 

“It would not be very prac- 
tical, Elijah. There might be mil- 
lions temperamentally capable of 
the deed.” 

“Millions,” grunted Baley, 
thinking of the crowds that long 
ago day who had screamed at 
the “dirty Spacers,” and of 
the threatening and slobbering 
crowds outside the shoe store the 
night before. 

He thought: Poor Julius. A 
suspect ! 

He could hear the Commis- 
sioner’s voice describing the 
period after the discovery of the 
body: '“It was brutal, brutal.” 
No wonder he had broken his 
glasses in shock and dismay. No 
wonder he did not want to re- 
turn to Spacetown. “I hate 
them,” he had ground out be- 
tween his teeth. 

Poor Julius, The man who 
could handle Spacers, The man 
whose greatest value to the City 



lay in his ability to get along 
with them. How much had that 
contributed to his rapid promo- 
tions? 

No wonder the Commissioner 
had wanted Baley to take over. 
Good old loyal, close-mouthed 
Baley. College chum! He would 
keep quiet if he found out about 
that little incident. Baley won- 
dered how cerebroanalysis was 
done. He imagined huge elec- 
trodes, busy pantographs skid- 
ding inklines across graphed 
paper. 

Poor Julius. He must already 
be seeing himself at the end of 
his career with a forced letter of 
resignation in the hands of the 
Mayor. 

The squad-car slanted up into 
the sub -levels of City Hall. 

IT was 14:30 when Baley ar- 
rived back at his desk. The 
Commissioner was out. R. Sam- 
my, grinning his mechanical grin, 
did not know where the Com- 
missioner was. 

Baley spent some time think- 
ing. The fact that he was hungry 
didn’t register. 

At 15:20 R. Sammy came to 
his desk and said, “The Com- 
missioner is in now, Lije.” 

Baley said, “Thanks.” 

For once he listened to R. 
Sammy without being annoyed. 
R. Sammy, after all, was a kind 
of relation to R. Daneel, and R. 



122 * 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Daneel obviously wasn’t a per- 
son — or thing, rather — to get an- 
noyed with. Baley wondered how 
it would be on a new planet with 
men and robots starting even 
about a City culture. He con- 
sidered the situation quite dis- 
passionately. 

The Commissioner was going 
through some documents as 
Baley entered, stopping occa- 
sionally to make notations. 

He said, “That was a giant- 
size blooper you pulled out in 
Spacetown.” 

TT^OR a moment, Baley felt puz- 
zled. Then it hit him with 
shocking impact. Jehoshaphat, 
how had he forgotten the verbal 
duel with Fastolfe! 

His long face took on a lugu- 
brious expression of chagrin. 
“I’ll say I did. Commissioner. 
I’m sorry.” 

Enderby looked up. His expres- 
sion was keen and his eyes 
glanced firmly through then- 
glass barriers. He seemed more 
himself than at any time these 
thirty hours. He said, “Fastolfe 
didn’t seem to mind, so we’ll for- 
get it. Unpredictable, these Spac- 
ers. You don’t deserve your luck, 
Lije. Next time, talk it over with 
me before you make like a sub- 
ether hero.” 

Baley nodded. He had tried a 
grandstand stunt and it hadn’t 
worked. Okay. He was a little 

THE CAVES OF STEEL 



surprised that he could be so 
casual about it, but there it was. 

He said, “Look, Commissioner. 
I want to have a two-man apart- 
ment assigned to Daneel and my- 
self. I’m not taking him home 
tonight.” 

“What’s all this?” 

“The news is out that he’s a 
robot. Remember? Maybe noth- 
ing will happen, but if there is 
a riot, I don’t want my family 
in the middle of it.” 

“Nonsense, Lije. I’ve had the 
thing checked. There’s no such 
rumor in the City.” 

“Jessie got the story some- 
where, Commissioner.” 

“Well, there’s no organized 
rumor. Nothing dangerous. I’ve 
been checking this ever since I 
got off the trimensic at Fastolfe’s 
dome, which was why I left. I 
had to track it down fast. There’s 
Doris Gillid's report. She went 
through a dozen Women’s Per- 
sonals in different parts of the 
City, You know Doris. She’s a 
competent girl. Well, nothing 
showed anywhere. Not a thing.” 
“Then how did Jessie get the 
rumor?” 

“It can be explained. R. Daneel 
made a display of himself in 
the shoe store. Did he really pull 
a blaster, Lije, or were you 
stretching the facts a little — just 
a little, perhaps?” 

“He really pulled one. Pointed 
it, too.” 

123 




C OMMISSIONER Enderby 

shook his head. “All right. 
Someone recognized him. As a 
robot, I mean.” 

“Hold on,” said Baley indig- 
nantly. “You can’t tell he’s a 
robot.” 

“Why not?” 

“Could you? I couldn’t.” 
“We’re no experts. Suppose 
there was a technician out of the 
Westchester robot factories in the 
crowd, a man who has spent his 
life building and designing ro- 
bots. He notices something queer 
about R. Daneel. Maybe in the 
way he talks or holds himself. 
He speculates about it. Maybe 
he tells his wife. She tells a few 
friends. Then it dies because peo- 
ple don’t believe it. Only it got 
to Jessie before it died.” 

“Maybe,” said Baley doubt- 
fully. “But how about an assign- 
ment to a bachelor room for two, 
anyway?” 

The Commissioner shrugged, 
lifted the intercom. After a while, 
he said, "Section Q-27 is all they 
can do. It's not a very good 
neighborhood.” 

“It’ll do,” said Baley. 

“Where’s R. Daneel now, by 
the way?” 

“He’s at our record files, try- 
ing to collect information on 
Medievalist agitators.” 

“But there are millions!” 

“I know, but it keeps him 
happy.” 



Baley was nearly at the door 
when he turned, half on impulse, 
and said, “Commissioner, did Dr. 
Sarton ever talk to you about 
Spacetown’s program? I mean 
about introducing the C/Fe cul- 
ture?” 

“The what?” 

“Introducing robots.” 

“Occasionally.” 

“Did he ever explain what 
Spacetown’s purpose was?” 

“Oh, improve health, raise the 
standard of living. The usual 
stuff. I nodded my head and all 
that. It’s just a matter of humor- 
ing them and hoping they’ll keep 
their ideas within reason. Maybe 
some day — ” 

Baley waited, but Enderby 
didn’t say what particular maybe 
some day might bring. 

Baley said, “Did he ever men- 
tion anything to you about emi- 
gration?” 

“Emigration? Never! Letting 
an Earthman into an Outer 
World is like finding a diamond 
asteroid in the rings of Saturn.” 

“I mean emigration to new 
worlds.” 

But the Commissioner an- 
swered that one with a simple 
stare of incredulous horror. 

Baley said with sudden blunt- 
ness, “What’s cerebroanalysis, 
Commissioner? Ever hear of it?” 

The Commissioner’s round face 
showed only polite interest. “No. 
What’s it supposed to be?” 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Nothing. Just picked it up.” 

Baley left the office and at 
his desk continued thinking. Cer- 
tainly the Commissioner wasn’t 
that good an actor. 

AT 16:05, Baley called Jessie 
and told her he wouldn’t be 
home that night or probably any 
night for a while. 

“Lije, is there trouble?” she 
asked anxiously. “Are you in 
danger?” 

“A policeman is always in a 
certain amount of danger,” he ex- 
plained lightly. It didn’t satisfy 
her. 

“Where will you be staying?" 

He didn’t tell her. “If you’re 
going to be lonely tonight,” he 
said, “stay at your mother’s.” 
He broke the connection abrupt- 
ly, which was probably just as 

well. 

At 16:20, he made a call to 
Washington. It took a long time 
to reach the man he wanted and 
an almost equally long time to 
convince him he ought to make 
an air-trip to New York the next 
day. By 16:40, he had succeeded. 

At 16:55, the Commissioner 
left, passing him with an uncer- 
tain smile. The day shift departed 
en masse. The skeleton night 
shift made its way in and greeted 
him in varied tones of surprise. 

R. Daneel came to his desk 
with a thick sheaf of papers. 
“This is a list of men and women 



who might belong to a Medieval- 
ist organization, Elijah.” 

Baley shook his head. “Can’t 
be. It’s too small.” 

“But there are over a million 
names here!” 

“Listen, Daneel. Almost all 
Earthmen are Medievalists in 
one way or another. Look at the 
Commissioner’s — ” he almost 
said “spectacles," then remem- 
bered that Earthmen must stick 
together, the Commissioner’s face 
must be protected in the figura- 
tive as well as the literal sense — 
“eye-omaments." 

“Yes,” said R. Daneel, “I had 
noticed them, but thought it per- 
haps indelicate to refer to them. 
I have not seen such ornaments 
on other City-dwellers.” 

“It is a very old-fashioned sort 
of thing.” 

“Does it serve a purpose of 
any sort?” 

“Usually. Daneel, how did you 
get your list?” 

“A machine did it for me. Ap- 
parently, one sets it for a par- 
ticular type of offense and it 
does the rest. I let it scan all 
disorderly conduct cases involv- 
ing robots over the jpast twenty- 
five years. Another machine 
scanned all City Newspapers for 
those who made unfavorable 
statements concerning robots or 
men of the Outer Worlds. It is 
amazing what can be done in 
three hours. The machine even

eliminated the names of non- 
survivors from the lists.” 

“You are amazed? Surely 
you’ve got computers on the 
Outer Worlds.” 

“Very advanced ones. But 
none are as massive and complex 
as the ones here. You must re- 
member, of course, that even the 
largest Outer World scarcely has 
the population of one of your 
Cities and so extreme complexity 
is not necessary.” 

“Have you ever been on 
Aurora?” 

“No,” said R. Daneel. “I was 
assembled here on Earth.” 

“Then how do you know about 
Outer World computers?” 

“My data store was drawn 
from Dr. Sarton.” 

"I see. Can you eat, Daneel?” 
“I am nuclear-powered. I had 
thought you were aware of that.” 
“I didn’t ask if you needed to 
eat. I asked if you covld eat — 
put food in your mouth, chew it 
and swallow it. I should think 
that would be important in seem- 
ing to be a man.” 

“I see your point. Yes, I can 
perform the mechanical opera- 
tions of chewing and swallowing. 
Naturally, I would eventually 
have to remove the merely mac- 
erated food from what you might 
call my stomach.” 

“All right. You can do that 
in the privacy of our room to- 
night. I’ve missed lunch, damn 



it, and I want you with me when 
I eat. And you can’t sit there 
and not eat without attracting 
attention.” 

“Very well,” said R. Daneel. 
“I shall be glad to— eat — with 
you.” 

S ECTION kitchens were the 
same all over the City. What’s 
more, Baley had been in Wash- 
ington, Toronto, Buenos Aires, 
London, Canton and Durban in 
line of duty, and they had been 
the same there, too. Perhaps it 
had been different in Medieval 
times when languages and diets 
had varied. Nowadays, yeast 
products were identical every- 
where; and English might not be 
the “English” of Shakespeare or 
Churchill, but it was the final 
potpourri that was current over 
all the continents and, with some 
modification, on the Outer 
Worlds as well. 

Language and dietary aside, 
there were the deeper similari- 
ties. There was always that par- 
ticular odor, undefinabJe but 
completely characteristic, of 
“kitchen.” There was the waiting 
triple line moving slowly in, con- 
verging at the door and splitting 
up again; right, left, center. 
There was the rumble of human- 
ity, speaking and moving, and 
the sharper clatter of plastic on 
plastic. There was the gleam of 
simulated wood, highly polished; 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




highlights on glass; long tables; 
the touch of steam in the air. 

Baley inched forward as the 
line moved. With all possible 
staggering of meal hours, a wait 
of at least ten minutes was al- 
most unavoidable. He said to R. 
Daneel in sudden curiosity, “Can 
you smile?” 

R. Daneel had been gazing at 
the interior of the kitchen with 
cool absorption. He turned and 
smiled. That is, his lips curled 
back and the skin about either 
end folded. Only the mouth 
smiled, however. The rest of the 
robot’s face was unchanged. 

Baley looked away. “Don’t 
bother. It doesn’t do a thing for 
you.” 

They were at the entrance. 
Person after person thrust a metal 
food-tag through the appropriate 
slot and had it scanned. Click — 
click— click — 

A smoothly running kitchen 
could allow the entrance of two 
hundred persons a minute, the 
tags of each one being fully 
scanned to prevent kitchen- jump- 
ing, meal-jumping and ration- 
stretching. But that was at 
maximum efficiency, which was 
lost when any one person requir- 
ed special treatment, like step- 
ping to the manual window, as 
Baley and R. Daneel did, in order 
to thrust a special permit pass at 
the official in charge. 

Jessie, an assistant dietitian be- 

THE CAVES OF STEEL 



fore she’d married Baley, had ex- 
plained it once to him. 

“It upsets things completely, 
throws off consumption figures 
and inventory estimates. It means 
special checks. You have to 
match slips with all the different 
Section kitchens to make sure 
the balance isn’t too unbalanced, 
if you know what I mean. There’s 
a separate balance sheet to be 
made out each week. Then if 
anything goes wrong and you’re 
overdrawn, it’s always your fault. 
It’s never the fault of the City for 
passing out special tickets to 
everybody and his kid sister. Oh, 
no. And when we have to say 
that free choice is suspended for 
the meal, don’t the people in line 
make a fuss! It’s always the 
fault of the people behind the 
counter — ” 

lY'NOWING this, Baley under- 
stood the dry and poisonous 
look he received from the woman 
behind the window. She made a 
few hurried notes. Home Section, 
occupation' reason for meal dis- 
placement (“official business,” a 
very irritating reason, but irre- 
futable). Then she folded the slip 
and pushed it into a slot. A com- 
puter seized it, devoured the 
contents and digested the in- 
formation. 

Finished with Baley, she turn- 
ed to R. Daneel. 

Baley jumped in hurriedly. He 

127 




said, “My friend is out-of-City.” 

The woman looked finally 
and completely outraged. “Home 
City, please,*’ she asked through 
clamped teeth. 

Baley intercepted for Daneel 
once again. “All records are to be 
credited to the Police Depart- 
ment. No details necessary. Offi- 
cial business.” 

The woman brought down a 
pad of slips with an angry slam 
and filled in the data in dark- 
light code with savage pressure 
of the first two fingers of her 
right hand. 

“How long will you be eating 
here?” 

“Till further notice,” said 
Baley. 

“Press here.” 

Baley had a short qualm as R. 
Daneel’s even fingers with their 
glistening nails pushed down- 
ward. Surely they wouldn't have 
forgotten to supply him with 
fingerprints. 

The woman took the blank 
away and fed it into the ma- 
chine near her elbow. 'It belched 
nothing back and Baley breathed 
more easily. 

She gave them little metal tags 
that were in the bright red that 
meant “temporary.” 

She said, “No free choices. 
We’re short this week. Take table 
DF.” 

They made their way toward 

DF. 



R. Daneel said, “I am under 
the impression that most of your 
people eat regularly in kitchens 
such as these.” 

“Yes. Of course, it’s rather 
gruesome eating in a strange 
kitchen. There’s no one you 
know. In your own kitchen, you 
have your own seat and you’re 
with your family and your 
friends. Especially when you’re 
young, mealtimes are the bright 
spot of the day.” Baley smiled 
in brief reminiscence. 

Table DF was apparently re- 
served for transients. Those al- 
ready seated watched their plates 
and did not talk with one an- 
other. They looked with sneak- 
ing envy at the laughing crowds. 

There is no one so uncom- 
fortable, thought Baley, as the 
man eating out-of-Section. Be it 
ever so humble, the old saying 
went, there’s no place like home- 
kitchen. Even the food tastes 
better, no matter how many 
chemists are ready to swear it to 
be no different from the food in 
Johannesburg, 

H E sat down on a stool and 
R. Daneel took one next to 

him. 

“No free choice,” said Baley, 
“so just close the switch there 
and wait.” 

It took two minutes. A disc 
slid back in the table top and a 
dish lifted. 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Mashed potatoes, zymoveal 
sauce and stewed apricots. Oh, 
well,” Baley said. 

A fork and two slices of whole 
yeast bread appeared in a recess 
just in front of the low railing 
that went down the long center 
of the table. 

R. Daneel said in a low voice, 
“You may help yourself to my 
serving, if you wish.” 

For a moment, Baley was 
scandalized. Then he remember- 
ed and mumbled, “That would 
be bad manners. Go on, eat.” 
Baley ate industriously, but 
without enjoyment. He flicked an 
occasional glance at R. Daneel. 
The robot ate with precise mo- 
tions of his jaws. Too precise. 
It didn’t look quite natural. 

Strange, now that Baley knew 
R. Daneel was actually a robot, 
all sorts of little disparities 
showed up clearly, such as no 
movement of an Adam’s apple 
when R. Daneel swallowed. Yet 
Baley didn’t mind so much. Was 
he getting used to the creature? 
Suppose people started afresh on 
a new world — how that ran 
through his mind ever since Dr. 
Fastolfe had put it there — sup- 
pose Bentley, for instance, were 
to leave Earth, could he get so 
he wouldn’t mind working and 
living alongside robots? . 

R. Daneel said, “Elijah, is it 
bad manners to watch another 
man while he is eating?” 



“If you mean stare directly 
at him, well, sure. That’s only 
common sense, isn’t it? A man 
has a right to his privacy. Or- 
dinary conversation is all right, 
but you don’t gape at a man 
while he’s chewing.” 

“I see. Why is it, then, that I 
count eight people watching us 
very closely?” 

Baley put down his fork. He 
looked about as though he were 
searching for the salt-pinch dis- 
penser. 

“I see nothing at all out of the 
ordinary.” 

But he said it without convic- 
tion. The mob of diners was only 
a vast conglomeration of stran- 
gers to him. And when R. Daneel 
turned his impersonal brown eyes 
upon him, Baley suspected un- 
comfortably that those were not 
eyes he saw, but photographic 
scanners. 

“I am quite certain,” said R. 
Daneel calmly. 

“Well, what of it? It’s crude 
behavior, but what does it 
proVe?” 

“I cannot say, Elijah. Is it 
coincidence that six of the watch- 
ers were in the crowd outside 
the shoe store last night?” 

CHAPTER XI 

L IJE Baley’s grip tightened on 
his fork. 

“Are you sure?” he demanded. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



129 




and immediately realized the use- 
lessness of the question. You 
don’t ask a computer if it is 
sure of the answer it disgorges; 
not even a computer with arms 
and legs and face. “Are they 
close to us?” 

“Not very. They are scattered.” 

Baley returned to his meal, his 
fork moving mechanically. Be- 
hind the frown on his long face, 
his mind worked furiously. 

Suppose the incident last night 
had been organized by a group 
of anti- robot fanatics — men who 
had studied robots with the in- 
tensity born of deep hostility. 
One of them might have recog- 
nized R. Daneel for what he was. 
(The Commissioner had sug- 
gested that, in a way. Damn it, 
there were surprising depths to 
that man.) 

Even if they had been unable 
to act in an organized manner 
at the spur of the moment, they 
would still have been able to plan 
for the future. If they could 
recognize a robot such as R. 
Daneel, they could certainly 
realize that Baley himself was a 
police officer. A police officer in 
the unusual company of a hu- 
manoid robot would very likely 
be a responsible man in the or- 
ganization. 

It followed then that observers 
at City Hall (or perhaps agents 
within City Hall) would be 
bound to spot Baley, R. Daneel, 



or both before too long a time 
had passed. That they had within 
twenty -four hours was not sur- 
prising, They might have done 
so in less time if Baley’s day 
had not been spent mainly in 
Spacetown and along the Motor- 
way. 

R. Daneel had finished his 
meal. He sat quietly waiting, his 
perfect hands resting lightly on 
the end of the table. 

“Had we not better do some- 
thing?” he asked. 

“We’re safe here in the kitch- 
en,” said Baley, “Now leave this 
to me. Please.” 

Baley looked about him cau- 
tiously and it was as though he 
saw a kitchen for the first time. 

What was the capacity of an 
average kitchen? About 2200. 
This one was larger than aver- 
age. 

Suppose the cry “Robot!” 
were tossed among the thousands 
like a — 

He was at a loss for a com- 
parison, 

A SPONTANEOUS riot could 
flare anywhere; in the kitch- 
ens as easily as in the corridors 
or in the elevators. More easily, 
perhaps. There was a lack of in- 
hibition at mealtimes, a sense of 
horseplay that could degenerate 
into something more serious at a 
trifle. 

But a planned riot would be 



110 GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




different. Here in the kitchen, 
the agitators would themselves 
be caught in a mob-filled room. 
Hundreds would certainly die 
and they themselves might easily 
be among them. 

No, a safe riot would have to 
be planned in the avenues of the 
City, in some relatively narrow 
passageway. There would be 
time for the quick, prepared fade- 
away along the side passage or 
the unobtrusive step onto an 
escalating Localway that would 
move them to a higher level and 
disappearance. 

Baley felt trapped. There were 
probably others waiting outside. 
Baley and R. Daneel were to be 
followed to a proper point and 
the fuse would be set off. 

R. Daneel said, “Why not ar- 
rest them?” 

“That would only start the 
trouble sooner. You know their 
faces, don’t you?” 

“I am not capable of forget- 
ting,” 

“Then we’ll nab them another 
time. Follow me. Do exactly as 
I do." 

He rose, turned his dish care- 
fully upside down, centering it 
on the movable disc on which it 
had risen. He put his fork back 
in its recess. R. Daneel, watching, 
did the same. The dishes and 
utensils dropped out of sight. 

R. Daneel said, “They are get- 
ting up, too.” 



"They won’t get too close. Not 
here.” 

TJALEY looked through the, 
steamy haze and the noise 
and with incongruous sharpness 
thought of a visit to the City Zoo 
with Ben six or seven years ago. 
It had been the boy’s first visit 
and he had been excited. After 
all, he had never actually seen 
a cat or a dog or a bird before. 
Even Baley himself, who had seen 
it a dozen, times before, was not 
immune to its fascination. 

It was feeding time in the 
sparrow cage and an attendant 
was dumping cracked oats into 
a long trough. Human beings had 
grown used to yeast substitutes, 
but animals, more conservative 
in their way, insisted on real 
grain. 

The sparrows flocked down in 
what seemed like hundreds. 
Wing to wing, with an ear- 
splitting twitter, they lined the 
trough — 

That was it, the picture that 
came to Baley’ s mind as he look- 
ed back at the kitchen he was 
leaving. Sparrows at the trough. 
The thought repelled him. 

He thought: Jehoshaphat, there 
must be a better way. 

But what better way? What 
was wrong with this way? It 
had never bothered him before. 

He said abruptly to R. Daneel, 
“Ready, Daneel?” 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



131 




“I am ready, Elijah.” 

They left the kitchen and 
escape was now flatly up to 
Baley. 

^TiHERE is a game that young- 
^ sters know called “running 
the strips.” Its rules vary from 
City to City, but the essentials 
are eternal. Its object is to get 
from point A to point B via the 
City's rapid transit system in 
such a way that the “leader” 
manages to lose as many of his 
followers as possible. A leader 
who arrives at the destination 
alone is skillful indeed, as is a 
follower who refuses to be shaken. 

The game is usually conduct- 
ed during the evening rush-hour 
when the increased flow of com- 
muters makes it more hazardous 
and complicated. The leader sets 
off, running up and down the 
accelerating strips. He does his 
best to do the unexpected, stand- 
ing on a strip as long as possible, 
then leaping off suddenly in either 
direction. He will run quickly 
through several strips, then re- 
main waiting once more. 

Pity the follower who incau- 
tiously careens forward one strip 
too far. Before he has caught his 
mistake, unless he is extraor- 
dinarily nimble, he has driven 
past the leader or fallen behind. 

To increase the complexity of 
the task tenfold, a leader will 
board the Localways or the Ex- 



pressways themselves, and hurtle 
off the other side. It is bad form 
to avoid them completely and 
also bad form to linger on them. 

The attraction of the game is 
not easy for an adult to under- 
stand, particularly for an adult 
who has never himself been a 
teen-age strip-runner. The play- 
ers are roughly treated by legiti- 
mate travelers into whose path 
they find themselves inevitably 
flying. They are persecuted by 
the police and punished by their 
parents, denounced in the schools 
and on the sub-etherics. No year 
passed without its four or five 
teen-agers killed at the game; its 
dozens hurt; its cases of injured 
innocent bystanders. 

Yet nothing could be done to 
wipe out the strip-running gangs. 
The greater the danger, the more 
the strip-runners had that most 
valuable of all prizes, honor in 
the eyes of their fellows. A suc- 
cessful one might well swagger; 
a well-known leader was cock- 
of -the -walk. 

Elijah Baley, for instance, re- 
membered with satisfaction even 
now that he had been a strip- 
runner once. He had led a gang 
of twenty from the Concourse 
Sector to the borders of Queens, 
crossing three Expressways. In 
two tireless and relentless hours, 
he had shaken off some of the 
most agile followers of the Bronx, 
and arrived at the destination 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




point alone. They had talked 
about that run for months. 

Baley hadn’t run the strips for 
over twenty years, but he remem- 
bered some of the tricks. What 
he had lost in agility, he made 
up in the fact that he was a 
policeman. No one but another 
policeman as experienced as him- 
self could possibly know where 
almost every metal-bordered al- 
ley began and ended. « 

TTE walked away from the 
kitchen briskly, but not too 
rapidly. Each moment he expect- 
ed the cry of “Robot! Robot!” 
to ring out behind him. He count- 
ed the steps until he felt the fif'st 
accelerating strip moving under 
him. 

He stopped for a moment, 
while R. Daneel moved smoothly 
up beside him. 

“Are they still behind us, 
Daneel?” 

“Yes. They are moving closer.” 

“That won’t last,” said Baley 
confidently. He looked at the 
strips stretching to either side, 
with their human cargo whipping 
to his left more and more rapid- 
ly as their distance from him in- 
creased. He had felt the strips 
beneath his feet many times a 
day almost all the days of his 
life, but he had not bent his 
knees in anticipation of running 
them in seven thousand days and 
more. He felt the old familiar 



thrill and his breath grew more 
rapid. 

He forgot the one time he had 
caught Ben at the game. He had 
lectured him interminably and 
threatened to have him* put un- 
der police surveillance. 

Lightly, quickly, at double the 
“safe” rate, he went up the 
strips. He leaned forward sharp- 
ly against the acceleration. The 
Localway was humming past. 
For a moment, it looked as 
though he would mount, but sud- 
denly he was fading backward, 
backward, dodging through the 
crowd to left and right as it thick- 
ened on the slower strips. 

He stopped and let himself be 
carried along at a mere fifteen 
miles an hour. 

“How many are with us, Dan- 
eel?” 

“Only one, Elijah.” The robot 
was at his side, unruffled, un- 
breathing. 

“He must have been a good 
one in his day, too, but he won’t 
last either.” 

He looked about quickly. 
Where were they now? B-22nd 
Street flashed by. 

He judged his steps carefully. 
Up the strips, smoothly and 
steadily, a swing onto the Local - 
way platform and a quick wrig- 
gle to the other side. 

Off he went and down the de- 
celerating strips in a complicated 
pattern so that his feet met the 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



133 





V- joint strips of an Expressway 
at the exact point of cross-over. 
Without loss of rhythm, he was 
accelerating again, then up and 
over an Expressway. 

“Is he with us, Daneel?” 

“Not one in sight, Elijah.” 
“Good. What a strip-runner 
you would have been, Daneel!” 
Off onto another Localway in 
a whirl and down the strips with 
a clatter to a doorway, large and 
official in appearance. A guard 
rose to his feet. 

Baley flashed his identification. 
“Official business.” 

They were inside. 

“Power plant,” said Baley 
curtly. “This covers our tracks 
completely.” 

T>ALEY had been in power 
plants before, including this 
one. Familiarity did not lessen 
his feeling of uncomfortable awe. 
His father had held an important 
job in such a plant — before a 
robot specialist replaced him. 

There was the surrounding 
hum of the tremendous genera- 
tors hidden in the central well of 
the plant; the faint sharpness of 
ozone in the air, the grim and si- 
lent threat of the red lines that 
marked the limits beyond which 
no one could pass without pro- 
tective clothing. 

Somewhere in the plant — -Baley 
had no idea just where — a pound 
of fissionable material was con- 



134 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




surned each day. Every so often, 
the radioactive fission products, 
the so-called “hot ash" was 
forced by air pressure through 
leaden pipes to distant caverns 
ten miles out in the ocean and a 
half-mile below the ocean floor. 
Baley sometimes wondered what 
would happen when the caverns 
were filled. 

He said to R. Daneel with sud- 
den gruffness, “Stay away from 
the red lines.” Then he added 
sheepishly, “But I suppose it 
doesn’t matter to you.” 

“Is it a question of radioactivi- 
ty?” asked Daneel. 

“Yes.” 

“Then it does matter to me. 
Gamma radiation destroys the 
delicate balance of a positronic 
brain. It would affect me much 
sooner than it would affect you.” 
“You mean it would kill you?” 
“I would require a new posi- 
tronic brain. Since no two can 
be alike, I would be a new in- 
dividual. The Daneel you now 
speak to would, in a manner of 
speaking, be dead." 

Baley looked at the other 
doubtfully. “I never knew that. 
Up these ramps.” 

“The point isn’t stressed. 
Spacetown wishes to convince 
Earthmen of the usefulness of 
such as myself, not of our weak- 
nesses.” 

“Then why tell me?” 

R, Daneel turned his eyes full 



on his human companion. “You 
are my partner, Elijah. It is well 
that you know my weaknesses 
and Shortcomings.” 

Baley cleared his throat and 
had nothing more to add to the 
subject. 

“Out in this direction,” he said 
a moment later, “and we’re a 
quarter of a mile from our apart- 
ment.” 

I T was a grim lower-class flat. 
One small room and two beds. 
Two fold-in chairs and a closet. 
A built-in sub-etheric screen that 
allowed no manual adjustment, 
and would be working only at 
stated hours, but would be work- 
ing then. No wash-basin and no 
facilities for cooking or even boil- 
ing water. A small trash -disposal 
pipe was in one corner of the 
room, an ugly, unadorned, un- 
pleasantly functional object. 

Baley shrugged. “I guess we 
can stand it.” 

R. Daneel walked to the trash - 
disposal pipe. His shirt unseamed 
at a touch, revealing a smooth 
and, to all appearances, well- 
muscled chest. 

“What are you doing?” asked 
Baley. 

“Getting rid of the food I in- 
gested. If I were to leave it, it 
would spoil and I would attract 
displeasure.” 

R. Daneel placed two fingers 
carefully under one nipple and 



THE CAVES OF STEEL

his chest opened longitudinally. 
He reached in and from a welter 
of gleaming metal withdrew a 
translucent sac, partly distended. 
He opened it while Baley watch- 
ed with a kind of horror. 

R. Daneel hesitated. He said, 
“The food is completely un- 
changed. I do not salivate or 
digest. It was drawn in through 
the gullet by suction, you know. 
It is as edible as if it were put 
through any other kind of ma- 
chine.” 

“That’s all right,” said Baley 
gently. “You just get rid of it.” 
R. Daneel’s food sac was of 
fluorocarbon plastic, Baley de- 
cided. At least the food did not 
cling to it It came out smoothly 
and was placed little by little 
into the pipe. A waste of good 
food at that, he thought. 

He sat down on one bed and 
removed his shirt. He said, “I 
suggest an early start tomorrow.” 
“For a specific reason?” 

“The location of this apart- 
ment isn’t known to our friends 
yet. At least, I hope not. If we 
leave early, we are that much 
safer. Once in City Hall, we will 
have to decide whether our part- 
nership is still practical.” 

“You think perhaps it is not?” 
Baley shrugged and said dour- 
ly, “We can't go through this sort 
of thing every day,” 

“But it seems to me — ” 

R Daneel was interrupted by 



the sharp scarlet sliver of the 
door signal. 

B ALEY rose Silently to his feet 
and unlimbered his blaster. 
The door signal flashed once 
more. 

He moved silently to the door, 
put his thumb on the blaster 
contact and threw the switch 
that activated the one-way trans- 
parency patch. It was small and 
had a distorting effect, but it was 
good enough to show Baley’s 
youngster, Ben, outside the door. 

Baley flung the door open, 
snatched brutally at Ben’s wrist 
as the boy raised his hand to 
signal a third time and pulled 
him in. 

The look of fright and bewil- 
derment faded only slowly from 
Ben’s eyes as he leaned breath- 
lessly against the wall toward 
which he had been hurled. He 
rubbed his wrist. 

“Dad!” he said. “You didn’t 
have to grab me like that.” 
Baley was staring through the 
view-patch of the closed door. 
As nearly as he could tell, the 
corridor was empty. 

“Did you see anyone out there, 
Ben?” 

“No. Gee, dad, I just came to 
see if you were all right.” 

“Why shouldn’t ! be all right?” 
“I don’t know. It was Mom. 
She was crying and all like that. 
She said I had to find you. If I 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




didn’t she said she would go her- 
self and then she didn’t know 
what would happen. She made 
me go, Dad.” 

Baley said, “How did you find 
me? Did your • mother know 
where I was?” 

“No, she didn’t. I called up 
your office." 

"And they told you?” 

Ben looked startled at his 
father's vehemence. 

“Sure. Weren’t they supposed 
to?” 

Baley and Daneel looked at 
one another. 

Baley rose heavily to his feet. 
“Where’s your mother now, Ben? 
At the apartment?” 

“No, we went to Grandma’s for 
dinner and stayed there. I’m 
supposed to go back there now. 
I mean as long as you’re all right, 
Dad.” 

“You’ll stay here. Daneel, did 
you notice the exact location of 
the floor Communo?” 

The robot said, “Yes. Do you 
intend leaving the room to use 
it?” 

“I’ve got to. I have to get in 
touch with Jessie.” 

“Might I suggest that it would 
be more logical to let Bentley 
do that? It is a form of risk and 
he is less valuable.” 

Baley stared: “Why, you — ” 
He thought: Jehoshaphat, what 
am I getting angry about? He 
went on more calmly, “You don’t 



understand, Daneel. Among us, 
it is not customary for a man to 
send his young son into possible 
danger, even if it is logical to do 
so.” 

“Danger!” squeaked Ben in a 
sort of horrified pleasure. “What’s 
going on, Dad? Huh, Dad?” 
“This isn’t any of your busi- 
ness, understand? I Want you in 
bed when I get back. You hear 
me?” 

“Aw, gosh. You could tell a 
fellow. I won’t say anything.” 
“In bed!” 

“Aw, yeast!” 

H ITCHING his jacket back, 
Baley stood at the floor 
Cummuno, his blaster butt ready 
for snatching. He spoke his per- 
sonal number into the mouthpiece 
and waited while a computer fif- 
teen miles away checked it to 
make sure the call was permis- 
sible. It was a very short wait, 
since a plainsclothesman had no 
limit on the number of his busi- 
ness calls. He spoke the code 
number of his mother-in-law's 
apartment. 

The small screen at the base 
of the instrument lit up and her 
face looked out at him. 

He said in a low voice, “Moth- 
er, put Jessie on,” 

Jessie must have been waiting 
for him. She appeared at once. 
Baley looked at her face and then 
darkened the screen deliberately. 



THE CAVES OF STEEt 



137 




“All right, Jessie. Ben’s here. 
Now what’s the matter?’* His 
eyes roved from side to side conr 
tinuously, watching. 

“Are you all right? You aren’t 
in trouble?” 

. “I’m obviously all right, Jessie. 
Now stop it.” 

“Oh, Lije, I’ve been so wor- 
ried.” 

“What about?” 

“You know. Your friend.” 

“There’ll be no trouble. I’m 
keeping Ben with me tonight and 
you go to bed. Good-by, dear.’* 

He broke the connection and 
waited for two breaths before 
starting back. His face was gray 
with apprehension and fear. 

Ben was standing in the middle 
of the room when Baley returned. 
One of his contact lenses was 
neatly pocketed in a little suc- 
tion cup. The other was still in 
his eye. 

Ben said, “Gosh, Dad, isn’t 
there any water in the place? 
Mr. Olivaw says I can’t go to 
the Personal.” 

“You can’t. Put that thing 
back in your eye, Ben. It won’t 
hurt you to sleep with them for 
one night.” 

“All right.” Ben obeyed and 
climbed into bed. “Boy, what a 
mattress H* 

Baley said to R. Daneel, “I 
suppose you won’t mind sitting 
up.” 

“Of course not. I was interest- 



ed, by the way, in the queer glass ; 
Bentley wears close to his eyes. 
Do all Earthmen wear them?” 
“Just some,” said Baley ab- 
sently. "I don’t, for instance.” 
“For what reason is it worn?” 
Baley was too absorbed with 
his own thoughts to answer. His 
own uneasy thoughts. 

The lights were out, but Baley 
remained wakeful. He was dimly 
aware of Ben’s breathing as it 
grew dCep and regular. When he 
turned his head, he became con- 
scious of R, Daneel, sitting in a 
chair with grave immobility, fac- 
ing the door. 

Then he fell asleep. , 

He dreamed Jessie was falling •;! 
into the fission chamber of a 
nuclear power plant. She held out 
her arms to him, shrieking, but 
he could only stand frozenly just 
outside a scarlet line and watch 
her distorted figure as it fell, 
growing smaller until it was only 
a dot. 

He could only watch her in 
the dream, knowing that it was 
he himself who had pushed her. 

CHAPTER XII 

|nLIJAH BALEY looked up as 
^ Commissioner Julius Ender- 
by entered the office. He nodded 
wearily. 

The Commissioner looked at 
the clock. “Don’t tell me you’ve 
been here all night.” 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“I won’t,” Baley said. 

The Commissioner asked in a 
low voice, “Any trouble last 
night?” 

"No.” 

“I've been thinking that I 
might be minimizing the danger 
of riots. If there’s anything to — ” 
“For God’s sake. Commission- 
er, if anything happened, I’d tell 
you. There was no trouble of any 
sort.” 

“All right.” The Commissioner 
moved away, closing the door 
that marked off the unusual pri- 
vacy that went with his exalted 
position. 

Baley looked after him and 
thought: He slept last night. 

Baley hadn’t. He bent to the 
routine report he was trying to 
write as a cover-up for the real 
activities of the last two days, 
but the words he had tapped out 
by finger-touch blurred and 
danced. Slowly, he became aware 
of an object standing by his desk. 

It was R. Sammy. Baley 
thought: Julius’s private me- 

chanical flunky. It pays to be a 
Commissioner. 

R. Sammy said through his 
fatuous grin, “The Commissioner 
wants to see you, Lije.” 

“He just saw me. Tell him I’ll 
be in later.” 

“He says right now.” 

“I heard you. Go away.” 

The robot backed away, say- 
ing, “The Commissioner wants 



to see you right now, Lije. He 
says fight now.” 

“Jehoshaphat,” said Baley an- 
grily. “I’m going. I’m going.” He 
got up from his desk, headed for 
the office and R. Sammy was 
silent. 

Baley said as he entered, 
“Damn it, Commissioner, don't 
send that thing after me, will 
you?” 

The Commissioner was tap- 
ping the paper before him. 
“There’s a record of a call you 
made to a Dr, Gerrigel at Wash- 
ington by insulated beam.” 
“That’s right.” 

“There’s no record of the con- 
versation, naturally, since it was 
insulated. What’s it all about?” 
“I’m after background infor- 
mation.” 

“He’s a roboticist, isn’t he?” . 
“Yes.” 

“What’s the point? What kind 
of information are you after?” 
“I’m not sure, Commissioner. 
I just have a feeling that in a 
case like this, information on 
robots might help.” 

“I wouldn’t, Lije. I don’t think 
it’s wise.” 

“What’s your objection?” 
“The fewer the people "who 
know about all this, the better.” 
“I’ll tell him as little as I can.” 
"I still don’t think it’s wise.” 
“Are you ordering me not to 
see him, Commissioner?” 

“No, no! Do as you see fit. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



139 




You’re heading this investigation. 
Only—” 

“Only what?” 

The Commissioner shook his 
head. “Nothing. Where is he? 
You know who I mean.” 
“Daneel’s still at the files.” 

The Commissioner paused a 
long moment. “We’re not making 
much progress, you know.” 
“We’re not making any. That’s 
why I'm calling in Dr. Gerrigel.” 
“All right,” said the Commis- 
sioner, but he didn’t look as 
though he really thought it was 
all right. 

R DANEEL was at Baley’s 
• desk when the plainclothes- 
man returned. 

“Well, and what have you 
got?” Baley asked gruffly. 

“I have completed my first 
rather hasty search through the 
files, partner Elijah. I believe I 
have located two people whose 
descriptions tally with two of 
those who tried to track us last 
night and who. moreover, were 
at the shoe store during the for- 
mer incident.” 

“Let’s see.” 

R. Daneel placed the stamp- 
size cards before Baley. They 
were mottled with the small dots 
that served as code. The robot 
also produced a portable decoder 
and put one of the cards into a 
slot. The dots possessed electrical 
conduction properties different 



from that of the card as a whole. 
The electric field passing through, 
the card was therefore distorted ; 
and, in response, the three-by- i 
six screen above the decoder was 
filled with words. Words which, \ 
uncoded, would have filled sev- . 
eral sheets of standard report- \ 
paper. Words, furthermore, which 
could not possibly be interpreted 
without an official police decoder. 

Baley read through the materi- 
al stolidly. The first person was 
Francis Clousarr, age 33 at time 
of arrest two years before; cause 
of arrest, inciting to riot; em- 
ployee at New York Yeast; home | 
address; parentage; hair, eyes , \ 
distinguishing marks, educational 
history, employment history, psy- j 
choanalytic profile, physical pro-| 
file, reference to tri-photo in the , 
rogues’ gallery. 

‘‘You checked the photo - 1 
graph?” asked Baley. | 

“Yes, Elijah.” R. Daneel spoke | 
patiently. \ 

The second person was Ger- \ 
hard Paul. Baley glanced at the 
material on that card and said, 
“This is all no good.” 

“I am sure that cannot be so. ’ 
If there is an organization of 
Earthmen capable of the crime 
we are investigating, these are 
members. Should they not be 
questioned?” 

“We’d get nothing out of 
them.” 

“They were there, both at the 



140 



ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



shoe store and in the kitchen. 
They cannot deny it.” 

“Just being there's no crime. 
Besides which, they can say they 
weren’t there. How can we prove 
they’re lying?” 

“I saw them.” 

“That’s no proof/’ said Baley 
savagely. “No court, if it ever 
came to that, would believe that 
you could remember two faces in 
a blur of a million.” 

“It is obvious that I can.” 
“Sure. Tell them what you are. 
As soon as you do that, you’re 
no witness. Your kind have no 
status in any court of law on 
Earth.” 

R. Daneel said, “I take it, 
then, that you have changed your 
mind.” 

“What do you mean?” Baley 
scowled at him. 

“Yesterday, in the kitchen, you 
said there was no need to arrest 
them. You said that as long as I 
remembered their faces, we could 
arrest them at any time.” 

“Well, I didn’t think it through. 
It can’t be dorfe.” 

“Not even for psychological 
reasons? They would not know 
we had no legal proof of their 
complicity in conspiracy.” 

Baley said tensely; “Look, lam 
expecting Dr. Gerrigel of Wash' 
ington in half an hour. Do you 
mind waiting till he’s been here 
and gone? Do you mind?” 

“I will wait,” said R. Daneel. 



A nthony gerrigel was 

a precise and very polite 
man of middle height, who look- 
ed far from being one of the most 
erudite roboticists on Earth. He 
was nearly twenty minutes late 
and quite apologetic about it. 
Baley, white with an anger bom 
of apprehension, shrugged off the 
apologies gracelessly. He checked 
his reservation on Conference 
Room D, repeated his instruc- 
tions that they were not to be 
disturbed for an hour and led Dr. 
Gerrigel and R. Daneel down the 
corridor, up a ramp, and through 
a, door that led to one of the 
spy-beam-insulated chambers. 

Before sitting down, Baley lis- 
tened to the soft burr of the 
pulsometer in his hand, waiting 
for any fading of the steady 
sound which would indicate a 
break, even a small one, in the 
insulation. He turned it on the 
ceiling, floor, and, with particu- 
lar care, on the door. There was 
no break. 

Dr. Gerrigel smiled a little. He 
looked like a man who never 
smiled more than a little. He was 
dressed with a neatness that could 
only be described as fussy. His 
iron-gray hair was smoothed 
carefully back and his face look- 
ed pink and freshly washed. He 
sat with prim stiffness. 

He said to Baley, “You make 
this seem very formidable.” 

“It’s important, Doctor. Any- 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



141 




thing we say here, of course, is 
top secret and the City will ex- 
pect you to forget it all when you 
leave.” Baley looked at his 
watch. 

The little smile on the roboti- 
cist’s face winked away. “Let me 
explain why I am late.” The mat- 
ter obviously weighed upon him. 
“I decided not to go by air. I get 
airsick.” 

, “That’s too bad,” said Baley. 
He put away the pulsometer, 
after checking its standard set- 
tings to make last-minute certain 
that there was nothing wrong 
with it, and sat down. 

“Not exactly airsick, but ner- 
vous. A mild agoraphobia. It’s 
nothing particularly abnormal, 
but it’s there. So I took the Ex- 
pressways.” 

Baley felt a sudden sharp in- 
terest. “Agoraphobia?” 

“I make it sound worse than 
it is,” the roboticist said at once. 
“It’s just the sensation you get 
in a plane. Have you ever been 
in one, Mr. Baley?” 

“Several times.” 

“Then you must know what I 
mean. It’s that feeling of being 
surrounded by nothing; of being 
separated from — from empty air 
by a mere inch of metal. It’s very 
uncomfortable.” 

“So you took the Expressway.” 
“Yes.” 

“All the way from Washington 
to New York?” 



“Oh, I’ve done it before. Since 
they built the Baltimore -Phila- 
delphia tunnel, it’s quite simple.” 

S O it was. Baley had never 
made the trip himself, but he 
was aware that it was possible. 
Washington, Baltimore, Phila- 
delphia, and New York had 
grown, in the last two centuries, 
to the point where all nearly 
touched. The Four City Area was 
almost the official name for the 
entire stretch of coast and there 
were a considerable number of 
people who favored administra- 
tive consolidation and the for- 
mation of a single super-City, ■ 
Baley disagreed. New York City ■ 
by itself was almost too large to| 
be handled by a centralized gov- j 
ernment. A larger City with over 
fifty million population would 
break down under its own weight. 

“The trouble was,” Dr. Gerri- 
gel was saying, “that I missed a i 
connection in Chester Sector , 1 
Philadelphia, and lost time. That ' 
and a little difficulty in getting a 
transient room assignment ended 3 
by making me late.” 

“Don’t worry about it, doctor. 
What you say, though, is inter- 
esting. In view of your dislike 
for planes, how would you feel 
about going outside City limits 
on foot?” 

“For what reason?" He looked 
startled. 

“I’m not suggesting that you 



M2 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



really should. I want to know 
how the notion strikes you, that’s 
all." 

“It strikes me very unpleas- 
antly.” 

“Suppose you had to leave the 
City at night and walk cross- 
country for half a mile or more." 

“I — I don’t think I could be 
persuaded to.” 

“No matter how important the 
necessity?” 

“If it were to save my life or 
those of my family, I might try 
it.” He looked embarrassed. 
“May I ask the point of these 
questions. Mr. Baley?” 

“I’ll tell you. A serious crime 
has been committed, a particular- 
ly disturbing murder. I’m not at 
liberty to give you the details. 
There is a theory, however, that 
the murderer, in order to commit 
the crime, did just what we were 
discussing — he crossed open 
country at night and alone. I was 
just wondering what kind of man 
could do that.” 

Dr. Gerrigel shuddered. “No 
one I know. Certainly not I. Of 
course, among millions, I suppose 
you could find a few such indi- 
viduals." 

“But you wouldn’t say it was 
a very likely thing for a human 
being to do." 

“No. Not at all likely.” 

“In fact, if there’s any other 
explanation for the crime, any 
other conceivable explanation, it 



should definitely be considered." 

Dr. Gerrigel looked more un- 
comfortable than ever as he sat 
upright with his well-kept hands 
precisely folded in his lap. “Do 
you have an alternate explana- 
tion in mind?" 

“Yes. It occurs to me that a 
robot, for instance, would have 
no difficulty at all in crossing 
open country." 

D R. GERRIGEL stood up. 
“Oh, my dear sir!” 

“What’s wrong?" asked Baley. 
“You mean a robot may have 
committed the crime?" 

“Why not?" 

“Murder? Of a human being?” 
“Yes. Please sit down, Doctor.” 
“Mr. Baley, there are two acts 
involved: walking cross-country 
and murder. A human being 
could commit the murder, but 
would find difficulty in crossing 
open country. A robot could cross 
open country easily, but the mur- 
der would be completely impos- 
sible. If you’re going to replace 
an unlikely theory by k an impos- 
sible one — ” 

“Impossible is a strong word." 
“You’ve heard of the First Law 
of Robotics, Mr. Baley?" 

“Sure. I can even quote it: A 
robot may not injure a human 
being, or, through inaction, allow 
a human being to come to harm." 
Baley suddenly pointed a finger 
at the roboticist. “Why can’t a

robot be built without the First 
Law? What’s so sacred about it?” 

“If you even know a little 
about robotics, you must know 
the gigantic task involved, both 
mathematically and electronical- 
ly, in building a positronic brain.” 

“I have an idea,” said Baley. 
He remembered well his visit to a 
robot factory once in line of duty. 
He had seen the library of book- 
films; long ones, each of which 
contained the mathematical a- 
nalysis of a single type of posi- 
tronic brain. It took more than 
an hour for the average film to be 
viewed at standard scanning 
speed, condensed though its 
symbolisms were. And no two 
brains were alike even when pre- 
pared according to the most rigid 
specifications. That, Baley under- 
stood, was a consequence of 
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Princi- 
ple. This meant that each film 
had to be supplemented by ap- 
pendices involving possible varia- 
tions. 

It was a job, all right. Baley 
wouldn’t deny that. 

Dr. Gerrigel said, “‘Well, then, 
you must understand that a de- 
sign for a new type of positronic 
brain, even one where only minor 
innovations are involved, is not 
the matter of a night’s work. It 
usually requires the entire re- 
search staff of a factory and takes 
anywhere up to a year. Even this 
would not be enough if it were 



not that the basic theory of such 
circuits has already been stand- 
ardized. The basic theory in- 
volves the Three Laws of Robot- 
ics: the First Law, which you’ve 
quoted; the Second Law, which 
states ‘A robot must obey the 
orders given it by human beings 
except where such orders would 
conflict with the First Law,’ and 
the Third Law, which states 'A 
robot must protect its own exist- 
ence as long as such protection 
does not conflict with the First or 
Second Law.’ Do you under- 
stand?” 

R DANEEL, who, to all ap- 
• pearances, had been follow- 
ing the conversation with close 
attention, broke in, “If you will 
excuse me, Elijah, I would like 
to see if I follow Dr. Gerrigel. 
What you imply, sir, is that any 
attempt to build a robot, the 
workings of whose positronic 
brain is not oriented about the 
Three Laws, would require first 
the setting up of a new basic 
theory and that this, in turn, 
would take many years.” 

The roboticist looked grati- 
fied. “That is exactly what I 
mean, Mr. — ” 

Baley said, “This is Daneel 
Olivaw, Dr. Gerrigel*" 

“Good day, Mr. Olivaw.” Dr. 
Gerrigel shook Daneel’s hand. He 
went on, “It is my estimation that 
it would take fifty years to de- 



144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




velop the basic theory of a non- 
Asenion positronic brain — -that 
is, one in which the basic assump- 
tions of the Three Laws are dis- 
allowed — and bring it to the 
point where robots similar to 
modern models could be con- 
structed.” 

“And this has never been 
done?” asked Baley. “We’ve been 
building robots for thousands of 
years. In all that time, hasn’t 
anybody or any group had fifty 
years to spare?” 

“Certainly,” said the roboti- 
cist, “but it is not the sort of 
work a roboticist would care to 
do.” 

“I find that hard to believe. 
Human curiosity will undertake 
anything.” 

“It hasn’t undertaken the non- 
Asenion robot. The human race, 
Mr. Baley, has a strong Franken- 
stein complex.” 

“A what?” 

“That’s a popular name de- 
rived from a Medieval novel de- 
scribing a robot that turned 
against its creator. I never read 
the novel myself. However, that’s 
beside the point. What I wish to 
say is that robots without the 
First Law are simply not built.” 

“And no theory for it even ex- 
ists?” 

"Not to my knowledge, and 
my knowledge—” he smiled self- 
consciously — “is rather exten- 
sive.” 



“And a robot with a First Law 
built in could not kill a man.” 
“Never. Unless the killings 
were completely accidental or 
unless it were necessary to save 
the lives of two or more men. In 
either case, the positronic conflict 
would ruin the brain beyond re- 
covery,” 

“All this represents the situa- 
tion on Earth. Right?” 

“Yes. Certainly.” 

“What about the Outer 
Worlds?” Baley demanded. 

S OME ok Dr. Gerrigel’s self- 
assurance seemed to ooze 
away. “Oh, dear, Mr. Baley, I 
couldn’t say of my own knowl- 
edge, but I’m sure that if non- 
Asenion positronic brains were 
ever designed or if the mathe- 
matical theory were worked out, 
we’d hear of it.” 

“Would we? Well, let me fol- 
low up another thought in my 
mind. Dr. Gerrigel. I hope you 
don’t mind.” 

“No. Not at all.” He looked 
helplessly first at Baley, then at 
R. Daneel. “After all, if It is as 
important as you say, I’m glad 
to do all I can.” 

“Thank you, Doctor. My ques- 
tion is, why humanoid robots? 
I’ve been taking them for granted 
all my life, but it occurs to me 
that I don’t know the reason for 
their existence. Why should a 
robot look like a man?” 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



145 




Dr. Gerrigel smiled a little. 
“The early literature of robotics 
is riddled with heated arguments 
over that very matter. If. you 
would like a very good reference 
to the polemics among the func- 
tionalists and antifunctionalists, 
I can recommend Hanford’s His- 
tory of Robotics- Mathematics is 
kept to a minimum. I think you'd 
find it very interesting.’* 

“I'll look it up," said Baley 
patiently. "Meanwhile, could you 
give me an idea?" 

“The decision was made on the 
basis of economics. Look here, 
Mr. Baley, if you were supervis- 
ing a farm, would you care to 
buy a tractor, a reaper, a harrow, 
a milker, an automobile, and so 
on, each with a positronic brain; 
or would you rather have ordin- 
ary un -brained machinery with 
a single positronic robot to run 
them all? The second alternative, 
incidentally, represents only a 
fiftieth or a hundredth the ex- 
pense.” 

“But why the human form?” 
Baley persisted. 

“Because it is the most success- 
ful generalized form in all nature. 
We are not a specialized animal, 
Mr. Baley, except for our ner- 
vous systems and a few odd 
items. If you want a design ca- 
pable of doing a great many dif- 
ferent things, you could do no 
better than to imitate the human 
form. Besides that, our entire 



technology is based on the hu- 
man form. An automobile, for 
instance, has controls meant to 
be manipulated by human hands 
and feet of a certain average size 
and shape, attached to the body 
by limbs of a certain average 
length and joints of a certain 
type. Even simple objects like 
chairs and tables or knives and 
forks are designed to meet such 
requirements. It is easier to have 
robots imitate the human shape 
than to redesign radically so 
much of our civilization." 

“That makes sense. Now isn’t 
it true. Doctor, that the roboti- 
cists of the Outer World manu- 
facture robots that are much 
more humanoid than our own?" 

“I believe so." 

“Could they manufacture a ro- 
bot so humanoid that it would 
pass as human under ordinary 
conditions?" 

R. GERRIGEL lifted his 
eyebrows and considered 
that. “It would be terribly ex- 
pensive. I doubt that the return 
could be profitable enough to 
make the attempt worth the ef- 
fort.” 

“Do you suppose,” went on 
Baley remorselessly, “that they 
could make a robot that would 
fool you into thinking it was hu- 
man?” 

The roboticist tittered. “Oh, 
my dear Mr. Baley. I doubt that. 



146 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Really, There’s more to a robot 
than just his appear — ” 

Dr. Gerrigel froze in the mid- 
dle of the word. Slowly, he turn- 
ed to R. Daneel, and his pink 
face went very pale. 

“Dear me !” he whispered. “Oh, 
dear me!” 

He reached out one hand and 
touched R. Daneel’s cheek gin- 
gerly. R. Daneel did not move 
away, but gazed at the roboticist 
calmly, 

“Dear me,” said Dr. Gerrigel, 
with what was almost a sob in his 
voice, “you are a robot.” 

“It took you a long time to 
realize that,” said Baley drily. 

“I wasn’t expecting it. I never 
saw one like this. Outer World 
manufacture?” 

“Yes.” 

“It’s obvious now. The Way he 
holds himself. The manner of his 
speaking. It is not a perfect imi- 
tation, Mr. Baley.” 

“It’s pretty good, though, isn’t 
it?” 

“Oh, it’s marvelous. I doubt 
that anyone could recognize the 
imposture at sight. I am very 
grateful to you for having me 
brought face to face with him. 
May I examine him?” The ro- 
boticist was on his feet, eager, 
Baley put out c hand. “Please, 
Doctor. In a moment. First, the 
matter of the murder, you know.” 
“Is that real, then?” Dr, Gerri- 
gel was bitterly disappointed and 



showed it. “I thought perhaps 
that was just a trick to keep my 
mind engaged and to see how 
long I could be fooled by — ” 

“It is not a trick, Dr. Gerrigel. 
Tell me now, in constructing a 
robot as humanoid as this one, 
with the deliberate purpose of 
having it pass as human, is it not 
necessary to make its brain pos- 
sess properties as close to those 
of the human brain as possible?” 
“Certainly.” 

“Very well. Couldn’t such a 
humanoid brain lack the First 
Law? Perhaps it is left out acci- 
dentally. You say the theory is 
unknown. The very fact that it 
is unknown means that the con- 
structors might set up a brain 
without the First Law. They 
would not know what to avoid.” 

G ERRIGEL was shaking his~ 
head vigorously. “Oh, no! 
Impossible! A robot without the 
First Law? It can’t be done!” 
“Are you sure? We can test 
the Second Law, of course. Dan- 
eel, let me have your blaster.” 
Baley’s eyes never left the ro- 
bot. His own fist, well to one side, 
gripped his own blaster tightly. 

R. Daneel said calmly, “Here 
it is, Elijah,” and held it out, 
butt-first, 

Baley said, “A plainclothes- 
man must never abandon his 
blaster. A robot has ho choice 
but to obey a human.” 



THE CAVES Of STIlt 



147 




“Except, Mr. Baley,” said Dr. 
Gerrigel, “when obedience in- 
volves breaking the First Law,” 

“Do you know, Doctor, that 
Daneel drew his blaster on an 
unarmed group of men and wo- 
men and threatened to shoot?” 

“But I did not shoot,” R. E)an- 
eel stated. 

“Granted, but the threat was 
unusual in itself, wasn’t it, Doc- 
tor?” 

Dr. Gerrigel bit his lip. “I’d 
need to know the exact circum- 
stances to judge. It does sound 
unusual, I admit.” 

“Consider this, then. R. Daneel 
was on the scene at the time of 
the murder, and if you omit the 
possibility of an Earthman hav- 
ing moved across open country, 
carrying a weapon with him, 
only Daneel of all the persons on 
the scene could have hidden the 
weapon.” 

“Hidden the weapon?” asked 
Dr. Gerrigel. “I don’t follow 
you.” 

“Let me explain. The scene of 
the murder was searched minute- 
ly and the blaster that did the 
killing was not found. Yet ,it 
could not have vanished like 
smoke. There is only one place 
it could have been; only one place 
they would not have thought to 
look.” 

“Where, Elijah?” asked R. 
Daneel. 

Baley brought his blaster into 



view, held its barrel firmly in 
the robot’s direction. 

“In your food sac, Daneel !” 

CHAPTER XIII 

T HE roboticist, whose glance 
had been alternating wildly 
between the plainclothesman and 
the robot, let it come to rest upon 
the human being. 

“What is all this?” he bleated. 
“I’ve asked you here for an au- 
thoritative analysis of this robot,” 
said Baley. “I can arrange to 
have you use the laboratories of 
the City Bureau of Standards. If 
you need any piece of equipment 
they don’t have, I’ll get it for 
you. What I want is a quick and 
definite answer, and hang the 
expense and trouble,” 

Dr. Gerrigel tittered nervously 
and said, “My dear Mr. Baley, 
I won’t need a laboratory.” 
“Why not?” asked Baley ap- 
prehensively, muscles tense. 

“It’s not difficult to test the 
First Law, I’ve never had to, but 
it’s simple enough.” 

Baley pulled air in through his 
mouth and let it out slowly. “Are 
you saying that you can test him 
here?” 

“Yes, of course. If I were a 
Doctor of Medicine and had to 
test a patient’s blood sugar, 
measure hi$ basal metabolic 
rate, his cortical function, or 
check his genes to pinpoint a 



148

congenital malfunction, I’d need 
elaborate equipment. On the 
other hand, I could learn if he 
was blind by merely passing my 
hand before his eyes and test 
whether he was dead by feeling 
for his pulse. 

“What I’m getting at is that 
the more important and funda- 
mental the property being tested, 
the simpler the needed equip- 
ment. It’s the same in a robot. 
The First Law is fundamental. 
It affects everything. If it were 
absent, the robot could not react 
properly in at least two dozen 
obvious ways.” 

As he spoke, he took out a 



flat, black object which expanded 
into a small book-viewer. He in- 
serted a well-worn spool into the 
receptacle. He then took out a 
stopwatch and a series of white 
plastic slivers that fitted together 
to form something that looked 
like a slide-rule with three inde- 
pendent movable scales. The no- 
tations upon it struck no chord 
of familiarity to Baley. 

Dr. Gerrigel tapped his book- 
viewer and smiled a little, as 
though the prospect of a bit of 
fieldwork cheered him. 

He said, “It’s my Handbook of 
Robotics. I never go anywhere 
without it. It’s like part of me.” 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



149 




He put the eyepiece of the 
viewer to his eyes and his finger 
dealt delicately with the controls. 
The viewer whirred and stopped, 
whirred and stopped. 

“Built-in index,” the roboti- 
cist said proudly, his voice muf- 
fled because the viewer covered 
his mouth. “I constructed it my- 
self. It saves a great deal of 
time. But that’s not the point 
now, is it? Let’s see. Umm, won’t 
you move your chair near me, 
Daneel?" 

R. Daneel did so. During the 
roboticist’s preparations, he had 
watched closely and unemotion- 
ally. 

Baley shifted his blaster to 
keep aiming at the robot. 

W HAT followed confused and 
disappointed him. Dr. Ger- 
rigel proceeded to ask questions 
and perform actions that seemed 
without meaning, punctuated by 
references to his triple slide-rule 
and occasionally to the viewer 
itself. 

At one time, he asked, “If I 
have two cousins, five years 
apart in age, and the younger is 
a girl, what sex w the older ?” 
Daneel answered, “It is im- 
possible to say on the informa- 
tion given.” 

Dr. Gerrigel’s only response, 
aside from a glance at his stop- 
watch, was to extend his right 
hand as far as he could sideways 



and to say, “Would you touch 
the tip of my middle finger with 
the tip of the third finger of your 
left hand?” 

Daneel did that promptly and 
easily. 

In fifteen minutes, Dr. Gerri- 
gel was finished. He used his 
slide-rule for a last silent calcu- 
lation, then disassembled it with 
a series of snaps. He put away 
his stopwatch, withdrew the 
Handbook from the viewer and 
collapsed the machine. 

“Is that all?” said Baley, 
frowning. 

“That’s all.” 

“But it’s ridiculous. You’ve 
asked nothing that pertains to the 
First Law.” 

“Mr. Baley, when a doctor hits 
your knee with a little rubber 
mallet, don’t you accept the fact 
that it gives information con- 
cerning the presence or absence 
of some degenerative nerve dis- 
ease? When he looks closely at 
your eyes and considers the re- 
action of your iris to light, are 
you surprised that he can tell you 
about your possible addiction to 
the use of certain alkaloids?” 

Baley said, “Wefl, what’s your 
decision?” 

“Daneel is fully equipped with 
the First Law!” The roboticist 
jerked his head in a sharp affirm- 
ative. 

“You can’t be right” said 
Baley flatly. 



150 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Are you teaching me my job?” 
The little smile had turned to an 
indignant glare. 

“I don’t mean you’re incom- 
petent,” said Baley. He put out 
a large, pleading hand. "But 
couldn’t you be mistaken? You’ve 
said yourself nobody knows any- 
thing about the theory of non- 
Asenion robots. A blind man 
could read by using Braille or a 
sound -scriber. Couldn’t you, in 
all honesty, say that a man had 
eyes because he knew the con- 
tents of a certain book-film, and 
be mistaken?” 

^TIHE roboticist grew genial 
-*■ again. *T see your point. But 
a blind man could not read 
by use of his eyes and that is 
what I was testing, if I may use 
the analogy. Take my word for 
it, regardless of what a non- 
Asenion robot could or could not 
do, it is certain that R. Daneel is 
equipped with the First Law.” 

“Couldn’t he have falsified his 
answers?” 

“A human brain, or any mam- 
malian brain, cannot be complete- 
ly analyzed by any mathematical 
discipline now known. The robot 
brain is completely analyzable, 
or it could not be constructed. 
We know exactly what the re- 
sponses to given stimuli must be. 
Therefore, no robot can falsify 
answers.” 

“Then let’s get down to cases,” 



said Baley. “R. Daneel did point 
a blaster at a crowd of human be- 
ings. I was there. Granted that 
he didn’t shoot, wouldn’t the 
First Law still have forced him 
into a kind of neurosis? It didn’t, 
you know. He was perfectly 
normal afterward.” 

The roboticist put a hesitant 
hand to his chin. “That is anoma- 
lous.” 

“Not at all,” said R. Daneel 
suddenly. “Partner Elijah, would 
you look at the blaster that you 
took from me?” 

Baley looked down upon the 
blaster he held cradled in his left 
hand. 

"Break open the charge cham- 
ber,” urged R. Daneel. "Inspect 
it.” 

Baley weighed his chances, 
then slowly put his own blaster 
on the table beside him. With a 
quick movement, he opened the 
robot’s blaster. 

“It’s empty,” he said blankly. 

“There is no charge in it,” 
agreed R. Daneel. “If you will 
look closer, you will see that the 
blaster has no ignition-bud and 
cannot be used.” 

Baley said, “You held an un- 
charged blaster on the crowd?” 

“I had to have a blaster or fail 
in my role as plainclothesman,” 
said R. Daneel, “yet to carry a 
charged and usable blaster might 
have made it possible for me to 
hurt a human being by accident, 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



1S1 




a thing which is, of course, un- 
thinkable. It did not occur to me 
to explain that to a detective be- 
cause I thought it was obvious. 
I still believe it is.” 

Baley stared bleakly at the 
useless blaster in his hand and 
said in a low voice, “I think that's 
all, Dr. Gerrigel. Thank you for 
your help.” 

T> ALEY sent out for lunch, but 
" when it came (yeast-nut cake 
and a rather extravagant slice of 
fried chicken on cracker) he 
could only stare at it. 

Round and round went the cur- 
rents of his mind. The immediate 
past stretched behind him like a 
misty improbable dream, dating 
back to the moment he had step- 
ped into Julius Enderby’s office 
and found himself suddenly im- 
mersed in a nightmare of murder 
and robotics. 

Jehoshaphat, it had begun only 
fifty hours before! 

Persistently, he had sought the 
solution in Spacetown. Twice he 
had accused R. Daneel, once of 
being a human being in disguise, 
and once as an admitted and 
actual robot; each time as a mur- 
derer. Twice the accusation had 
been broken. 

Against his will, he was being 
forced to turn his suspicions to 
the City, and since last night he 
dared not. Certain questions bat- 
tered at his conscious mind, but 



he would not listen. If he heard 
them, he couldn’t help but an- 
swer them and he didn’t want to 
face the answers. 

“Lije! Lije!” A hand shook 
Baley’s shoulder roughly. 

Baley stirred and said, “What’s 
up, Phil?” 

Philip Norfis, Plainclothesman 
C-5, sat down, put his hands on 
his knees and leaned forward, 
peering at Baley’s face. “What 
happened to you? Been living on 
knockout drops lately? You were 
sitting there with your eyes open 
and near as I could make out, 
you were dead.” 

He rubbed his thinning, pale 
blond hair, and his close-set eyes 
appraised Baley’s cooling lunch 
greedily. “Chicken!” he said. “It’s 
getting so you can’t get it without 
a doctor’s prescription.” 

“Take some,” offered Baley 
listlessly. 

Decorum won out and Norris 
said, “Oh, well, I'm going out to 
eat in a minute. Say, what’s do- 
ing with the Commish?” 

“What?” 

Norris attempted a casual at- 
titude, but his hands were rest- 
less. “You know what I mean. 
You’ve been living with him ever 
since he got back. What’s up? A 
promotion in the works?” 

Baley frowned and felt reality 
return somewhat at the touch of 
office politics. Norris had approx- 
imately his own seniority and he 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




was bound to watch assiduously 
for any sign of official preference. 

Baley said, "No promotion. 
And if it's the Commissioner 
you’re wanting, I wish I could 
give him to you!” 

‘‘Don’t get me wrong, Lije. I 
don’t care if you get promoted. 
I just mean that if you’ve got 
any pull with the Commish, how 
about using 't for the kid?” 
Baley didn't have to ask what 
kid. Vincent Barrett, the young- 
ster who had been moved out of 
his job to make room for R. 
Sammy, was shuffling up from 
an unnoticed corner of the room. 
A skull-cap turned uncomfort- 
ably in his hands and the skin 
over his high cheek-bones creased 
as he tried to smile. 

“Hello, Mr. Baley.” 

“Oh, hello, Vince. How’re you 
doing?” 

“Not so good, Mr. Baley.” 

\fINCE was looking about hun- 
" grily. Baley thought: He 

looks lost, half-dead — declassi- 
fied. 

Then, savagely, his lips almost 
twisting with the force of his 
emotion, he thought: But what 
does he want from me? 

He said, "I’m sorry, kid.” What 
else was there to say? 

“I keep thinking,” said the boy. 
"Maybe something has come up.” 
Norris moved close and spoke 
into Baley’s ear. "Someone’s got 



to stop this! They’re going to 
push out Chenlow now.” 
"What?” 

"Haven’t you heard?” 

“No, I haven’t. Damn it, he’s 
a C-3. He’s got ten years behind 
him.” 

"I know. But a machine with 
legs can do his work. Who’s 
next, now?” 

Young Vince Barrett was ob- 
livious to the whispers. He said 
out of the depths of his own 
thinking, "Mr. Baley?” 

"Yes, Vince?” 

"You know what they say? 
They say Lyrane Millane, the 
dancer, is really a robot.” 

“That’s silly.” 

"Is it? They say they can make 
robots look just like humans; 
give them a special plastic skin, 
sort of.” 

Baley thought guiltily of R. 
Daneel and found no words. He 
shook his head. 

The boy said, "Do you suppose 
anyone will mind if I just walk 
around? It makes me feel better 
to see the old place.” 

“Go ahead, kid-” 

The youngster wandered off. 
Baley and Norris watched him 

go. 

Norris said, “Maybe the Medi- 
evalists are right. The hell with 
robots. Old Earth has a better 
future without them.” 

Baley muttered, “Eight billion 
people and the uranium run- 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



153 




ning out! What’s better about 
it?” 

'‘What if the uranium does run 
out? We’ll import it. Or we’ll 
discover other nuclear processes. 
We can use sun power and that’s 
good for billions of years. We 
can build space stations inside 
Mercury’s orbit to act as energy 
accumulators. We’ll transmit en- 
ergy to Earth by direct beam.” 

This project was not new {o 
Baley. The speculative fringe of 
science had been playing with it 
for a hundred and fifty years at 
least. What was holding it up 
was the impossibility, so far, of 
projecting a beam tight enough 
to reach so many million miles 
without total dissipation, Baley 
said as much. 

Norris argued, “When it’s nec- 
essary, it’ll be done.” 

B ALEY thought of an Earth 
of unlimited energy. Popula- 
tion could continue to increase; 
the yeast farms could expand; 
hydroponic culture intensify. En- 
ergy was the only thing needed. 
The raw minerals could be 
brought in from the uninhabited 
rocks of the System. If ever water 
became a bottleneck, more could 
be brought in from the moons of 
Jupiter. For that matter, the 
oceans could be frozen and 
dragged out into space where they 
could circle Earth as moonlets 
of ice. There they would be. 



always available for use, while 
the ocean bottoms would repre- 
sent more land for exploitation; 
more room to live. Even carbon 
and oxygen could be maintained 
and increased on Earth through 
utilization of the methane at- 
mosphere of Titan and the frozen 
oxygen of Umbriel. 

Earth’s population could reach 
a trillion or two. Why not? There 
was a time when the current 
population of eight billion would 
have been considered impossible. 
Even a population of a single 
billion would have been unthink- 
able a couple of thousand years 
ago. There had always been 
prophets of Malthusian doom in 
every generation since Medieval 
days and they had always been 
proven wrong. 

What would Fastolfe say? A 
world of a trillion? Surely! But 
they would be dependent on im- 
ported air and water and an 
energy supply from complicated 
storehouses millions of miles 
away. Earth would be, and re- 
main, staring over the edge of 
disaster if any single part of the 
program failed. Disruption for 
only one hour would be catas- 
trophic now. What would it be 
then? A minute? A second? Less? 

Baley said, “I think it would 
be easier to ship off some of the 
surplus population.” It was more 
an answer to the picture he had 
conjured up than to anything

Norris had just been saying. 

“Who’d have us?" said Norris 
with bitter lightness. 

“Any uninhabited planet." 

Norris rose, patted Baley on 
the shoulder. “Lije, you eat your 
chicken, and recover. You must 
be living on knockout pills." 

Baley watched him leave with 
a humorless twist to his mouth. 
Norris would spread the news 
and it would be weeks before 
the office comedians would lay 
off. But at least it got him off 
the subject of young Vince, or 
robots, or declassification. 

He sighed as he put a fork into 
the now-cold and somewhat 
soggy chicken, 

A S Baley finished the last of 
the yeast-nut, R. Daneel left 
his own desk (assigned him that 
morning) and approached. 

Baley eyed him uncomfortably. 
“Well?" 

R. Daneel said, “The Commis- 
sioner is not in his office and it 
is not known when he’ll be back. 
I’ve told R. Sammy we will use 
it and that he was to allow no 
one but the Commissioner to en- 
ter." 

“What are we going to use it 
for?" 

“Greater privacy. I’m sure you 
agree that we must plan our next 
move. After all, you do not in- 
tend to abandon the investiga- 
tion, do you?” 



That was precisely what Baley 
longed to do, but he rose and 
led the way into Enderby’s office. 

The robot said, “Partner Eli- 
jah, since last night, you are not 
yourself. There is a definite al- 
teration in your mental aura." 

A horrible thought sprang into 
Baley’s mind. “Are you tele- 
pathic?” • 

“No, of course not,” said R. 
Daneel. 

Baley’s panic ebbed. “Then 
what the devil do you mean 
about my mental aura?" 

“It is difficult to explain. You 
will recall that I was originally 
designed to study human psy- 
chology for our people back in 
Spacetown.” 

“I know. You were adjusted to 
detective work by the simple in- 
stallation of a justice -desire cir- 
cuit." Baley did not try to keep 
the sarcasm out of his voice. 

“Exactly, Elijah. But my orig- 
inal design remains essentially 
unaltered. I was constructed for 
the purpose of cerebroanalysis." 

“For analyzing brain waves?” 

“Why, yes. It can be done by 
field -measurements without the 
necessity of direct electrode con- 
tact, if the proper receiver exists. 
My mind is such a receiver. Is 
that principle not applied on 
Earth?" 

Baley didn’t know. He ignored 
the question and said cautiously, 
“If you measure the bra in- waves, 



THE CAVES OF STEEL

what do you get out of it?” 

“Not thoughts, Elijah. I get a 
glimpse of emotion and, most of 
all, I can analyze temperament, 
the underlying drives and atti- 
tudes of a man. For instance, it 
was I who was able to ascertain 
that Commissioner Enderby was 
incapable of killing a man under 
the circumstances of*the time of 
the murder.” 

“And they eliminated him as a 
suspect on your say-so.” 

“It was safe enough to do so. 
I am a very delicate machine in 
that respect.” 

Again a thought struck Baley. 
“Wait! Commissioner Enderby 
didn’t know he was being cere- 
broanalyzed, did he?” 

“There was no need to hurt his 
feelings.” 

“I mean you just stood there 
and looked at him. No electrodes. 
No needles and graphs." 

“Certainly not. I am a self- 
contained unit.” 

Baley bit his lower lip in anger 
and chagrin. It had been the one 
remaining inconsistency, the one 
loophole through which a last 
stab might be made to pin the 
crime on Spacetown. 

R DANEEL had stated that 
• the Commissioner had been 
cerebroanalyzed. One hour later, 
the Commissioner himself had, 
with apparent candor, denied any 
knowledge of the term. Certainly 



no man could have undergone the 
shattering experience of electro- 
encephalographic measurements 
by electrode and graph under the 
suspicion of murder without an 
unmistakable impression of what 
cerebroanalysis must be. 

But now that discrepancy had 
evaporated. The Commissioner 
had been cerebroanalyzed and 
had never known it. R. Daneel 
told the truth; so had the Com- 
missioner. 

“Well,” said Baley sharply, 
“what does cerebroanalysis tell 
you about me?” 

“You are disturbed.” 

“That’s a great discovery, isn’t 
it? You’re damn right I’m dis- 
turbed.” 

“Specifically, though, your dis- 
turbance is due to a dash be- 
tween motivations within you. On 
the one hand, your devotion to 
the principles of your profession 
urges you to look deeply into this 
conspiracy of Earthmen who lay 
siege to us last night. Another 
motivation, equally strong, forces 
you in the opposite direction. 
This much is apparent in the 
electric field of your cerebral 
cells” 

“My cerebral cells, yeast!” 
snapped Baley. “Look, I’ll tell 
you why there’s no point in in- 
vestigating your so-called con- 
spiracy. It has nothing to do with 
the murder. I thought it might 
have. I’ll admit that. Yesterday,

in the kitchen, I thought we were 
in danger. But what happened? 
They followed us out, were quicks 
ly lost on the strips and that was 
that. That was not the action of 
well-organized and desperatemen. 

“My own son found out where 
we were staying easily enpugh. 
He called the Department. He 
didn’t even have to identify him- 
self. Our alleged conspirators 
could have done the same if they 
had really wanted to get us.” 
f “Didn’t they?” 

“Obviously not. If they had 
wanted riots, they could have 
started one at the shoe counter, 
and yet they backed out tamely 
enough before one man and a 
blaster. One robot, and a blaster 
which they must have known you 
would be unable to fire. They’re 
Medievalists, harmless crackpots. 
You wouldn’t know that, but I 
should have. And I would have, 
if it weren’t for the fact that this 
whole business has me thinking 
in idiotic melodramatic terms. 

“I tell you I know the type 
of people that become Medieval- 
ists. They're people who find life 
too hard for them here and get 
lost in an ideal world of the past 
that never really existed. If you 
could cerebroanalyze a move- 
ment as you do an individual, you 
would find they are no more ca- 
pable of murder than Julius En- 
derby himself.” 

R. Daneel said slowly, “I can- 



not accept your statements at 
face value.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Your conversion to this view 
is too sudden. There are certain 
discrepancies, too. You arranged 
the appointment with Dr. Ger- 
rigel hours before the evening 
meal. You did not know of my 
food sac then and could not have 
suspected me as the murderer. 
Why did you call him?” 

“I suspected you even then.” 
“And last night you talked in 
your sleep.” 

B ALEY’S eyes widened. “What 
did I say?” 

“Merely the one word ‘Jessie* 
several times. I believe you were 
referring to your wife.” 

Baley let his tight muscles 
loosen. He said shakily, “I had a 
nightmare. Do you know what 
that is?” 

“I do not know by personal 
experience, of course. The dic- 
tionary definition is that it is a 
bad dream.” 

“And do you know what a 
dream is?” 

“Again, the dictionary defini- 
tion only. It is an illusion of 
reality experienced during the 
temporary suspension of con’ 
scious thought which you call 
sleep.” 

“Sometimes the illusions can 
seem damned real. Well. I dream- 
ed my wife was in danger. I

called her name. That happens. 
You can take my word for it.” 
“I am only too glad to do so. 
But it brings up a thought. How 
did Jessie find out I was a robot?” 
Baley’s forehead went moist 
again. “We're not going into that 
again, are we? The rumor — ” 

“I am sorry to interrupt, part- 
ner Elijah, but there is no rumor. 
If there were, the City would be 
alive with unrest today. I have 
checked reports coming into the 
Department and there simply is 
no rumor. Therefore, how did 
your wife find out?” 

“Jehoshaphat! What are you 
trying to say? Do you think my 
wife is one of the members of — 
of this — ” 

“I do, Elijah.” 

Baley gripped his hands to- 
gether tightly. “Well, she isn’t, 
and we won’t discuss that point 
any further.” 

“This is not like you, Elijah. 
In the course of duty, you ac- 
cused me of murder twice.” 

“And is this your way of get- 
ting even?” 

“I am not sure I understand 
what you mean by the phrase. I 
approve your readiness to suspect 
me. You had your reasons. They 
were wrong, but they might have 
been right. Equally strong evi- 
dence points to your wife.” 

“As a murderess? Jessie 
wouldn’t hurt her worst enemy. 
She couldn’t set foot outside the 



City. She couldn’t — Why, if you 
were flesh and blood. I’d — ” 

“I merely say that she is a 
member of the conspiracy. I say 
that she should be questioned.” 

“Not on whatever it is you call 
your life. Now listen to me. The 
Medievalists aren’t after our 
blood. It’s not the way they do 
things. But they are trying to get 
you out of the City. And they’re 
trying to do it by a kind of psy- 
chological attack. They’re trying 
to make life unpleasant for you 
and for me, since I’m with you. 
They could easily have found out 
Jessie was my wife, and it was 
an obvious move for them to let 
the news leak to her. She’s like 
any other human being. She 
doesn’t like robots. She wouldn’t 
want me to associate with one, 
especially if she thought it in- 
volved danger, and surely they 
would imply that. I tell you it 
worked. She begged all night to 
have me abandon the case or to 
get you out of the City some- 
how.” 

“Presumably,” said R. Daneel, 
“you have a very strong urge to 
protect your wife against ques- 
tioning. It seems obvious to me 
that you are constructing this line 
of argument without really be- 
lieving it.” 

“What the hell do you think 
you are?” yelled Baley. “You’re 
not a detective! You’re a cere- 
broanalysis machine like the elec- 



158 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




troencephalographs we have in 
this building! You’ve got arms, 
legs, a head and can talk, but 
you’re not one inch more than 
that machine! Putting a lousy cir- 
cuit into you doesn't make you a 
detective, so you keep your 
mouth shut and let me do the 
figuring out!” 

• The robot said quietly, “I think 
it would be better if you lowered 
your voice, Elijah. Granted that 
I am not a detective in the sense 
that you are, I would still like 
to bring one small item to your 
attention.” 

“I’m not interested.” 

“If I am wrong, you will tell 
me so, and it will do no harm. 
It is only this. Last night you 
left our room to call Jessie by 
corridor phone. I suggested that 
your son go in your place. You 
told me it was not the custom 
among Earthmen for a father to 
send his son into danger. Is it the 
custom for a mother to do so?” 

“No, of cour — ” began Baley, 
and stopped. 

“You see my point,” said R. 
Daneel. “Ordinarily, if Jessie 
feared for your safety and wished 
to warn you, she would risk her 
own life, not send her son. The 
fact that she did send Bentley 



could only mean that she felt that 
he would be safe while she herself 
would not. If the conspiracy con- 
sisted of people unknown to Jes- 
sie, that would not be the case, 
or at least she would have no 
reason to think it to be the case. 
On the other hand, if she were a 
member of the conspiracy, she 
would know — she would know, 
Elijah — that she would be watch- 
ed for and recognized whereas 
Bentley might get through un- 
noticed.” 

“Wait now,” said Baley, sick 
at heart. “That’s feather-fine 
reasoning, but — ” 

The signal on the Commission- 
er’s desk started flickering mad- 
ly. R. Daneel waited for Baley to 
answer, but the man could only 
stare at it helplessly. The robot 
closed contact. 

“What is it?” 

R. Sammy’s slurring voice 
said, “There is a lady here who 
wishes to see Lije. I told her he 
busy, but she will not go 
away. She says her name is 
Jessie.” 

“Let her in,” said R. Daneel 
calmly, and his brown eyes rose 
unemotionally to meet the pan- 
icky glare of Baley’s.
