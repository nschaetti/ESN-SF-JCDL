WHICHNESS AND WHERENESS 



jV/T artin Gardner and Stephen 
Barr are old friends — to 
science-fiction readers, to each 
other and to Galaxy. As a matter 
of fact, they’ve each played a 
considerable part, at one time or 
another, in Galaxy’s history — 
Steve Barr with such memorable 
stories as The Back of Our 
Heads and I Am a Nucleus, 
while Martin Gardner’s connec- 
tion with the magazine goes back 
to a point before it existed; he 
was one of the original experts 
called in for advice on policies 
and programs before the first 
issue of Galaxy came out. Now 
both Gardner and Barr have new 
books out; and although the 
books are not in a technical sense 
related, they certainly supple- 
ment each other handsomely. 



Barr’s book is about the where- 
ness of things ; it is called Experi- 
ments in Topology (Crowell). 
What is topology? Well, says 
Barr, it begins with “the contin- 
uity of space, or shapes; it gen- 
eralizes, and then by analogy 
leads us into other kinds of con- 
tinuity — and space as we usually 
understand it is left far behind. 
Really high-bouncing topologists 
not only avoid anything like pic- 
tures of these things, they mis- 
trust them.” 

Barr is a high-bouncing top- 
ologist. His experiments — all of 
which you can do, by the way; 
you may not think so at first, 
because they bounce pretty high, 
too, but you can — will lead you 
a far piece from the Moebius 
strip and the four-color map

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s probletns. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

problem. Of course, he doesn’t 
skimp these subjects, nor yet that 
3-D paradigm of the Moebius 
strip that is called the Klein 
bottle in fact, he shows you how 
to build one — out of paper! 
And his Moebius strips take some 
surprising turns. Assuming that 
you carefully scissored one down 
the midline of its narrow ribbon, 
do you know what would hap- 
pen? If you do that with a paper 
collar like a cigar band, obvious- 
ly you get two paper collars. But 
if you do it with the paper- collar- 
given-a-half-turn called a Moeb- 
ius strip — ? 

Well, you don’t get two. Cut- 
ting it in half leaves it whole; 
you come out with a single 
Moebius strip, half as wide, twice 
as “long”. (Assuming that a 
Moebius strip has “length”.) And 
the reason? It is a matter of 
“handedness”. 

“Handedness” is what Martin 
Gardner’s The Ambidextrous 
Universe (Basic Books) is about; 
its subtitle is “Left, Right and 
the Fall of Parity.” Starting with 
topological considerations Gard- 
ner goes on to consider the fourth 
dimension and what would hap- 
pen if a 3-D body (say a man) 
were rotated in a fourth dimen- 
sion, as a two-dimensional sheet 
of paper can be rotated in a 



third. In that context, does re- 
versal” of left and right really 
mean anything? Gardner comes 
at the answer by quoting from 
George O. Smith’s Amateur in 
Chancery (originally published 
here) as well as from such other 
topologically interesting science 
fiction as George Gamow’s The 
Heart on the Other Side and H. 
G. Well’s The Plattner Story. In 
a symmetrical universe, Gardner 
concludes, “handedness” means 
nothing but an arbitrary conven- 
tion, based on nothing more sub- 
stantial than common agreement. 

But is the universe symmetri- 
cal? 

That’s where the fall of parity 
comes in, for at least in some 
types of intranuclear reactions it 
is not. Why? How? 

That’s what science is working 
on now. Gardner does not supply 
the answer. He does, however, 
give a priceless quotation from 
Niels Bohr, speaking to Wolf- 
gang Pauli who had just propos- 
ed to him a theoretical explana- 
tion for the non-parity effects: 

“We are all agreed that your 
theory is crazy. The question 
which divides us is whether it 
is crazy enough to have a chance 
of being correct. My own feel- 
ing is that it is not crazy 
enough.” — FREDERIK POHL

GALAXY 



MINDSWAP 

by ROBERT SHECKLEY 

ILLUSTRATED BY MORROW 



Only a multimillionaire could afford 
star-travel in the body. Only an idiot 
would take a chance on the other way I 



I 

Ti yfarvin Flynn read the follow- 
T’J. j n g advertisement in the 
classified section of the Stanhope 
Gazette: 

“ Gentleman from Mars, age 
43, quite, studious, cultured, 
wishes to exchange bodies with 
similarly inclined Earth gentle- 
man. August 1 — September 1. 



References Exchanged. Brokers 
Protected.” 

This commonplace announce- 
ment was enough to set Flynn’s 
pulse racing. To swap bodies with 
a Martian! 

It was an exciting idea, but 
also a repellent one. After all, 
no one would want some sand- 
grubbing old Martian inside his 
head moving his arms and legs, 



7 



looking out of his eyes and lis- 
tening with his ears. But in return 
for this unpleasantness, he, Mar- 
vin Flynn, would be able to see 
Mars. And he would be able to 
see it as it should be seen; 
through the senses of a native. 

As some wish to collect paint- 
ings, others books, others wom- 
en, so Marvin Flynn wanted to 
acquire the substance of them 
all through travel. But this, his 
ruling passion, was sadly unful- 
filled. He had been born and 
raised in Stanhope, New York. 
Physically, his town was some 
three hundred miles from New 
York City. But spiritually and 
emotionally, the two cities were 
about a hundred years apart. 

Stanhope was a pleasing rural 
community situated in the foot- 
hills of the Adirondacks, gar- 
landed with orchards and dotted 
with clusters of brown cows a- 
gainst rolling green pastureland. 
Invincibly bucolic, Stanhope 
dung to antique ways. Amiably, 
but with a hint of pugnacity, the 
town kept its distance from the 
flint-hearted megalopolis to the 
south. The IRT-7th Avenue sub- 
way had burrowed upstate as far 
as Kingston, but no further. Gi- 
gantic freeways twisted their 
concrete tentacles over the coun- 
tryside, but could not take over 
Stanhope’s elm-1 ined Main 
Street. Other communities main- 
tained a blast pit; Stanhope 

8 



clung to its antiquated jet field. 
Often at night, Marvin had lain 
in bed and listened to that poig- 
nant sound of a vanishing rural 
America; the lonely wail of a 
jetliner. 

Stanhope was satisfied with it- 
self. The rest of the world seem- 
ed quite satisfied to leave Stan- 
hope in its romantic dream of a 
less hurried age. 

The only person whom the ar- 
rangement did not suit was Mar- 
vin Flynn. 

11 e had gone on the usual tours, 
and had seen the usual 
things. Like everyone else, he 
had spent his weekends in Eur- 
ope. And he had explored the 
sunken city of Miami by scuba, 
gazed at the Hanging Gardens 
of London, and worshipped in 
the Bah’ai temple in Haifa. For 
his longer vacations he had gone 
on a walking tour across Marie 
Byrd Land, explored the lower 
Ituri Rain Forest, crossed Sinki- 
ang by camel and had even lived 
for several weeks in Lhassa, the 
art capital of the world. 

In short, the usual tourist as- 
sortment. Flynn wanted to really 
travel. 

That meant going extraterres- 
trial. 

It didn’t seem so much to ash. 
Yet he had never even been to 
the Moon. 

In the final analysis, it was a 
GALAXY 



matter of economics. Interstellar 
travel in the flesh was expensive, 
out of the question for an aver- 
age sort of fellow. Unless, of 
course, he wished to avail himself 
of the advantages of Mindswap. 

Marvin had tried to reconcile 
himself to his position in life, and 
to the very acceptable possibili- 
ties which that position offered 
him. After all, he was free, gray 
and 31, a tall, broad-shouldered 
boy with a clipped black mus- 
tache and gentle brown eyes. He 
had received the usual education 
— grade school, high school, 
twelve years of college, and four 
years of post-graduate work — 
and was considered well trained 
for his job with the Reyck-Peters 
Corporation. There he fluoro- 
scoped plastic toys for micro- 
shrinkage, porosity, texture fati- 
gue and the like. Perhaps it 
wasn’t the most important job 
in the world; but then, we can’t 
all be kings or spaceship pilots. 
It was certainly a responsible po- 
sition, especially when one con- 
siders the importance of toys in 
this world, and the vita! task of 
alleviating the frustrations of 
children. 

Marvin knew all this; and yet, 
he was unsatisfied. To see Mars, 
to visit the burrow of the Sand 
King, to travel through the aural 
splendor of The Wound, to listen 
to the chromatic sands of the 
Great Dry Sea . 

10 



He had dreamed before. But 
this time was different. 

That strange sensation in his 
throat argued a decision in the 
forming. Marvin wisely did not 
try to force it. Instead, he put 
on his beanie and went down- 
town to the Stanhope Pharmacy. 

II 

4 s he had expected, his best 
friend, Billy Hake was at 
the soda fountain, drinking an 
LSD frappe. 

“How’s the mom, Sorn?” Hake 
asked, in the slang popular at 
that time. 

“Soft and mazy, Esterhazy,” 
Marvin replied, giving the obli- 
gatory response. 

“Du koomen ta de la klipje?” 
Billy asked. (Pidgin Spanish- 
Afrikaans dialect was the new 
laugh sensation that year.) 

“Ja, Mijnheer,” Marvin ans- 
wered, a little heavily. His heart 
simply was not in clever repar- 
tee. 

Billy caught the nuance of 
dissatisfaction. He raised a quiz- 
zical eyebrow, folded his copy of 
James Joyce Comics, popped a 
Keen-Smoke into his mouth, bit 
down to release the fragrant 
green vapor, and asked, “For- 
why you burrow?” The question 
was wryly phrased but obviously 
well-in ' ended. 

Marvin sat down beside Billy. 

GALAXY 



Heavy-hearted, yet unwilling to 
reveal his unhappiness to his 
light-hearted friend, he held up 
both hands and proceeded to 
speak in Plains Indian Sign Lan- 
guage. (Many intellectually in- 
clined young men were still un- 
der the influence of last year’s 
sensational Projectoscope pro- 
duction of Dakota Dialogue , star- 
ring Bjorn Rakradish as Crazy 
Horse and Milovar Slavovivowitz 
as Red Cloud, done entirely in 
gesture.) 

Marvin made the signs, mock- 
ing yet serious, for heart-that- 
breaks, horse-that-wanders, sun- 
that-will-not-shine, moon-that- 
cannot rise. 

He was interrupted by Mr. 
Bigelow, proprietor of the Stan- 
hope Pharmacy. Mr. Bigelow 
was a middle-aged man of 74, 
slightly balding, with a small but 
evident paunch. Yet he affected 
boys’ ways. Now he said to Mar- 
vin, “Eh, Mijnheer, querenzie 
tornar la klopje inmensa de la 
cabeza vefrouvens in forma de 
ein skoboldash sundae?” 

It was typical of Mr. Bigelow 
and others of his generation to 
overdo youthful slang. “Schnell,” 
Marvin said, putting him down 
with the thoughtless cruelty of 
youth. 

“Well, I never,” said Mr. Bige- 
low, and moved huffily away. 

Billy perceived his friend’s 
pain. It embarrassed him. He was 



34, nearly a man. He had a good 
job as foreman of Assembly Line 
23 in Peterson’s Box Factory. 
He clung to adolescent ways, of 
course, but he knew that his age 
presented him with certain obli- 
gations. Thus, he cross-circuited 
his fear of embarrassment, and 
spoke to his oldest friend in clear. 

“Marvin. What’s the matter?” 

'll /T arvin shrugged his shoulder, 
' ^ quirked his mouth and 
drummed aimlessly with his fin- 
gers. He said, “Oiga, hombre, ein 
Kleinnachtmusik es demasiado, 
nicht wahr? The Todt you ruve 
to touch . .” 

“Straighten it,” Billy said, with 
dignity beyond his years. 

“I’m sorry,” Marvin said, in 
clear. “It’s just — oh, Billy, I 
really do want to travel so bad- 
ly!” 

Billy nodded. He was aware of 
his friend’s obsession. “Sure,” he 
said. “Me too.” 

“But not as bad. Billy - — I got 
the burns.” 

His skoboldash sundae arrived. 
Marvin ignored it, and poured 
out his heart to his lifelong friend. 
“Mira, Billy, it’s really got me 
wound tighter than a plastic re- 
triever coil. I think of Mars and 
Venus, and really far-away 
places like Aldeberan and Antar- 
es and — I mean, gosh, I just 
can’t stop thinking about it all. 
Like the Talking Ocean of 



MINDSWAP 



11 



Procyon IV, and the tripartritate 
hominoids of Allua II, and it’s 
like I’ll simply die if I don’t real- 
ly and actually see those places.” 
“Sure,” his friend said. “I’d 
like to see them, too.” 

“No, you don’t understand,” 
Marvin said. “It’s not just to see 
— it’s like — it’s worse than — 
I mean, I can’t just live here in 
Stanhope the rest of my life. 
Even though I got a nice job and 
I’m dating some really guapa 
girls. But heck, I can’t just marry 
some girl and raise kids and — 
and — there’s gotta be something 
more!” 

Then Marvin lapsed into ad- 
olescent incoherence. But some- 
thing of his feelings had come 
through the wild torrent of his 
words, and his friend nodded 
sagely. 

“Marvin,” he said softly, “I 
read you five by five, honest to 
Sam I do. But gee, even inter- 
planetary travel costs fortunes. 
And interstellar stuff is just 
plain impossible.” 

“It’s all possible,” Marvin 
said, “if you use Mindswap.” 
“Marvin! You can’t mean 
that!” His friend was too shocked 
to avoid the exclamation. 

“I can!” Marvin said. “And 
by the Christo malherido, I’m 
going to!” 

That shocked them both. Mar- 
vin hardly ever used bad lan- 
guage. 

12 



“But you can’t,” Billy said. 
“Mindswap is dirty!” 

“ ‘Dirty he who dirty thinks, 
cabron.’ ” 

“No, seriously. You don’t want 
some sandgrubbing ole Martian 
inside your head? Moving your 
legs and arms, looking out of 
your eyes, touching you, and 
maybe even — ” 

Marvin cut him off before he 
said something really bad. 
“Mira,” he said. “Recuerda que 
I’ll be in his body, on Mars, so 
he’ll be having the same embar- 
rassments.” 

“Martians haven’t got no sense 
of embarrassment,” Billy said. 

“That’s just not true,” Marvin 
said. Although younger, he was 
in many ways more mature than 
his friend. He had been an apt 
student in Comparative Inter- 
stellar Ethics. And his intense de- 
sire to travel rendered him less 
provincial in his attitudes, more 
prepared to see the other crea- 
ture’s point of view, than his 
friend. From the age of 12, when 
he had learned how to read, Mar- 
vin had studied the manners and 
modes of many different races 
in the Galaxy. Furthermore, he 
had scored in the 95th percentile 
in Projective Empathy. 

He jumped to his feet. “By 
jingo!” he cried, striking the palm 
of his left hand with his right 
fist, “I’ll do it!” 

The strange alchemy of de- 

GALAXY 



cision had transformed him. 
Without hesitation he returned 
home, packed a light suitcase, 
left a note for his parents, and 
caught the jet to New York. 

Ill 

I n New York, Marvin went di- 
rectly to the Body-Brokerage 
House of Otis, Blanders and 
Klent. He was sent to the office 
of Mr. Blanders, a tall, athletic 
man in the prime of life and 
already, at sixty-three, a full 
partner in the firm. He explained 
to this man his purpose in com- 
ing. 

“Of course,” Mr. Blanders said. 
“You have reference to our ad- 
vertisement of Friday last. The 
Martian gentleman’s name is Ze 
Kraggash, and he is very highly 
recommended by the rectors of 
East Skern University.” 

“What does he look like?” 
Marvin asked. 

“See for yourself,” Blanders 
said. He showed Marvin a photo- 
graph of a being with a barrel 
chest, thin legs, slightly thicker 
arms, and a small head with an 
extremely long nose. The picture 
showed Kraggash standing knee- 
deep in oozy clay, waving to 
someone. Printed on the bottom 
of the photograph were the 
words: “Souvenir of Mud Heav- 
en — Mars’ Year-‘Round Vaca- 
tionland.” 



“Nice looking chap,” Mr. 
Blanders commented. Marvin 
nodded doubtfully. 

“His home,” Blanders continu- 
ed, “is in Wagomstamk, on the 
edge of the Disappearing Desert 
in New South Mars. It is an 
extremely popular tourist area, as 
you probably know. Like you, 
Mr. Kraggash is desirous of 
travelling, and wishes to find a 
suitable host body. He has left 
the selection entirely up to us, 
stipulating only mental and 
physical health.” 

“Well,” Marvin said, “I don’t 
mean to boast, but I’ve always 
been considered healthy.” 

“I can see that at a glance,” 
Mr. Blanders said. “It is only a 
feeling, of course, or perhaps an 
intuition; but I have come to 
trust my feelings in thirty years 
of dealing with the public. Purely 
on that basis I have already re- 
jected three applicants for this 
particular Swap.” 

Mr. Blanders seemed so proud 
of this that Marvin felt impelled 
to say, “Have you really?” 

“Most certainly. You can have 
no conception of how frequently 
I must detect and eliminate mis- 
fits in this line of work. Neuro- 
tics who seek ugly and illicit 
thrills; criminals who wish to es- 
cape the purlieu of local law; 
the mentally unstable. I cull 
them all.” 

“I hope that I don’t fit any of 

13 



MINDSWAP 



those categories,” Marvin said, 
with an embarrassed little laugh. 

“I can tell at once that you do 
not,” Mr. Blanders said. “I 
would judge you as an extremely 
normal young man; almost ex- 
cessively normal, if that were 
possible. You have been bitten 
by the travel bug, which is very 
suitable for your time of life, and 
is a passion akin to falling in 
love, or fighting an idealistic war, 
or becoming disillusioned with 
the world, and other postures of 
the young. It is very fortunate 
that you had either the native wit 
or the good luck to come to us, 
the oldest and most reliable 
brokerage house in the Swap 
business, rather than to some of 
our less scrupulous competitors; 
or worst of all, to the Open Mar- 
ket.” 

TV /[ arvin knew very little about 
IVi fjjg Open Market; but he 
remained silent, not wishing to 
betray his ignorance. 

“Now then,” Mr. Blanders 
said, “we have certain formali- 
ties which we must go through 
before we can gratify your re- 
quest.” 

“Formalities?” Marvin asked. 

“Most certainly. First, you 
must have a complete examina- 
tion — physical, mental and 
moral. Next, you and the Mar- 
tian gentleman will both sign a 
Reciprocal Damage Clause. This 



states that any damage to your 
host body, whether by omission 
or commission, and including 
Acts of God, will (1) be recom- 
pensed at the rate established by 
interstellar convention, and (2) 
that such damage will be visited 
reciprocally upon your own body 
in accordance with the lex talion- 
is.” 

“Huh?” Marvin said. 

“Eye for eye, tooth for tooth,” 
Mr. Blanders explained. “Sup- 
pose you, in the Martian corpus, 
break a leg. Interstellar law re- 
quiries that, upon re-occupying 
your own body, your own leg be 
broken in as scientific and pain- 
less a manner as possible.” 

“Even if it was an accident?” 
“Especially if it were an acci- 
dent. We have found that the 
Reciprocal Damage Clause has 
cut down the number of such ac- 
cidents quite considerably.” 

“This begins to sound sorta 
dangerous,” Marvin said. 

“Any course of action contains 
an element of danger,” Mr. Blan- 
ders said. “But the risks involved 
in Swapping are statistically un- 
important, assuming that you 
stay out of the Twisted World.” 

ttT don’t know very much 
-S- about the Twisted World,” 
Marvin said. 

“Nobody does,” Blanders said. 
“That’s why you’re supposed to 
stay out of it.” 



14 



GALAXY 



Marvin nodded thoughtfully. 
“What else is there?” 

“Nothing to speak of. Just pa- 
perwork, waivers of special rights 
and immunities, that sort of 
thing. And, of course, I must give 
you the standard warning about 
metaphoric deformation.” 

“All right,” Marvin said. “I’d 
like to hear it.” 

“I just gave it,” Blanders said. 
“But I’ll give it again. Watch out 
for metaphoric deformation.” 
“I’d be glad to,” Marvin said. 
“But I don’t know what it is.” 
“It’s really quite simple,” Blan- 
ders said. “You might consider 
it a form of situational insanity. 
You see, our ability to assimilate 
the unusual is limited, and these 
limits are quickly reached and 
surpassed when we travel to 
alien planets. We experience too 
much novelty; it becomes un- 
bearable, and the mind seeks re- 
lief through the buffering process 
of analogizing. It forms a bridge 
between the accepted known and 
the unacceptable unknown, imbu- 
ing the intolerable unknown with 
a desirable familiarity. When, 
unable to handle the flood of 
data by the normal process of 
conceptual analogizing, the sub- 
ject becomes victim to perceptual 
analogizing. The process is also 
known as Panzaism. Does that 
make it clear?” 

“No.” Marvin said. “Why is it 
called Panazaism?” 



“The concept is self-explana- 
tory,” Blanders said. “Do® 
Quijote thinks the windmill is a 
giant; whereas Panza thinks the 
giant is a windmill. Quijotism 
may be defined as the perception 
of everyday things as rare en- 
tities. The reverse of that is Pan- 
zaism, which is the perception of 
rare entities as everyday things." 

“Do you mean,” Marvin asked, 
“that I might think I was look- 
ing at a cow, when actually it 
was an Altairian?” 

“Precisely,” Blanders said. “Ifa 
simple enough, once you apply 
yourself. Just sign here and heraj 
and we will get on with it.”

Y^espite a bipedal frame, tfafl 
Martian is one of tha 
strangest creatures in the galaxy. 
Indeed, from a sensory view- 
point, the Kvees of Aldeberan, 
despite their double brains and 
special-function limbs, are close*] 
to us. It is a disturbing thing t® 
Swap into the corpus of a Mar- 
tian. 

Marvin Flynn found himself is 
a pleasantly furnished room. 
There was a single window} 
through it, he gazed with Mar- 
tian eyes upon a Martian land- 
scape. 

He closed his eyes, since ha 
could register nothing except a 
dismaying confusion. Despite in- 



MINDSWAP 



15 



oculations, he was beset by the 
nausea-producing waves of cul- 
ture-shock, and he had to stand 
very still until it subsided. Then, 
cautiously, he opened his eyes 
and looked again. 

He perceived low, flat sand 
dunes, made up of a hundred or 
more distinct hues of gray. A sil- 
very-blue wind was running 
across the horizon, and an ochre 
counter-wind seemed to be at- 
tacking it. The sky was red, and 
many indescribable hues were 
visible in the infra-red scale. 

In everything, Flynn saw 
spidery spectrum lines. Earth 
and sky presented him with a 
separate dozen palettes, some 
complementary, more of them 
clashing. There was no harmony 
in nature’s colors on Mars. 

Marvin found a pair of glasses 
in his hand, and slipped them on. 
Immediately, the roar and clash 
of colors was reduced to man- 
ageable proportions. The numb- 
ness of shock receded, and he be- 
gan to perceive other things. 

First, a heavy booming in his 
ear, and a quick rattle beneath 
it, like the tattoo of a snare drum. 
He looked around for the source 
of this noise, and saw nothing ex- 
cept earth and sky. He listened 
more carefully, and found that 
the sounds were coming from his 
own chest. They were his lungs 
and heart; sounds which all Mar- 
tians lived with. 



Now Marvin was able to take 
stock of himself. He looked at 
his legs, which were long and 
spindly. There was no knee-joint; 
instead, the leg was pivoted at 
the ankle, shin, mid-thigh, and 
upper thigh. He walked, and ad- 
mired the fluid motion of his 
movements. His arms were 
slightly thicker than his legs, and 
his double-jointed hands had 
three fingers and two opposable 
thumbs. He could bend and 
twist these in a surprising num- 
ber of ways. 

He was dressed in black shorts 
and a white jumper. His chest- 
prop was folded neatly and 
covered with an embroidered 
leather case. He was amazed at 
how natural it all seemed. 

And yet, it was not surprising. 
The ability of intelligent crea- 
tures to accommodate to new 
environments was what made 
Mindswap possible. 

Flynn was musing on this when 
he heard a door open behind 
him. He turned and saw a Mar- 
tian standing in front of him, 
dressed in a government uniform 
of green and gray stripes. The 
Martian had reversed his feet in 
greeting, and Marvin quickly re- 
sponded in kind. 

/^ne of the glories of Mindswap 
is “automatic education.” In 
the amusing jargon of the trade: 
“When you take over a house,

GALAXY 



you get the use of the furnish- 
ings.” The furnishings, of course, 
are the use of primary available 
knowledge in the host brain. 
Knowledge such as language, 
customs, mores and morals, gen- 
eral information about the area 
in which one lives, and so forth. 
This is primary-environment in- 
formation; general, impersonal, 
useful as a guide, but not neces- 
sarily reliable. Personal memo- 
ries, likes, dislikes, are, with cer- 
tain exceptions, unavailable to 
the occupier; or available only 
at the cost of considerable mental 
effort. Again, in this area there 
is what appears to be a type of 
immunological reaction, which 
allows only a superficial degree 
of contact between disparate en- 
tities. 

“Soft wind,” the Martian said, 
in the classic old Martian greet- 
ing-form. 

“And cloudless sky,” Flynn re- 
plied. (To his annoyance, he 
found that his Host-body had a 
slight lisp.) 

“I am Meenglo Orichichich, of 
the Tourist Bureau. Welcome to 
Mars, Mr. Flynn.” 

“Thanks,” Flynn said. “Awful- 
ly good to be here. It’s my first 
Swap, you know.” 

“Yes, I know,” Orichichich 
said. He spat on the floor — a 
sure sign of nervousness — and 
uncurled his thumbs. From the 
corridor there came a sound of 



heavy voices. Orichichich said, 
“Now then, concerning your stay 
on Mars — ” 

“I want to see the Burrow of 
the Sand King,” Flynn said. 
“And, of course, the Talking 
Ocean.” 

“Both excellent choices,” the 
official said. “But first there are 
one or two minor formalities.” 

“Formalities?” 

“Nothing too difficult,” Orich- 
ichich said, his nose twisting to 
the left in the Martian smile. 
“Would you look over these pa- 
pers and identify them, please?” 

Flynn took the proffered pa- 
pers and scanned them. They 
were replicas of the forms he had 
signed on Earth. He read them 
through, and found that all the 
information had been sent cor- 
rectly. 

“These are the papers I sign- 
ed on Earth,” he said. 

The noise from the corridor 
grew louder. Marvin could make 
out words: “Scalded egg-laying 
son of a frostbitten tree stump! 
Gravel -loving degenerate!” 

Those were very strong insults 
indeed. 

Marvin raised his nose quizzi- 
cally. The official hastily said, 
“A misunderstanding, a mixup. 
One of those unfortunate occur- 
rences which occur even to the 
best-run of government tourist 
services. But I am quite sure 
that we can straighten it out in

five gulps of a rapi, if not soon- 
er. Permit me to ask you if — ” 
There was the sound of a 
scuffle in the corridor. Then a 
Martian burst into the room, with 
a Martian sub-official clinging to 
his arm and trying to stop him. 

'die Martian who had burst in 
was extremely old, as could 
be told by the faint phosphores- 
cence of his skin. His arms 
quivered as he pointed both of 
them at Marvin Flynn. 

“There!” he shouted. “There 
it is, and by treestumps I want 
it now!” 

Marvin said, “Sir, I am not in 
the habit of being addressed as 
‘it’.” 

“I am not addressing you,” the 
old Martian said. “I do not know 
nor care who or what you are. I 
am addressing the body which 
you are occupying, and which is 
not yours.” 

“What are you talking about?” 
“This gentleman,” the official 
said, “claims that you are oc- 
cupying a body which belongs to 
him.” He spat twice on the floor. 
“It is a mixup, of course, and we 
can straighten it out at once — ” 
“Mixup!” howled the old Mar- 
tian. “It’s an out-and-out fraud!” 
“Sir,” Marvin said, with cold 
dignity, “you are under a grave 
misapprehension. This body was 
legally and fairly rented by me.” 
“Scaly-skinned toad!” the old 



man shouted. “Let me at him!” 
He struggled with circumspec- 
tion against the restraining grip 
of the guard. 

Suddenly, an imposing figure 
dressed entirely in white ap- 
peared in the doorway. All with- 
in the room fell silent as their 
gaze fell upon the feared and 
respected representative of the 
South Martian Desert Police. 

“Gentlemen,” the policeman 
said, “there is no need for re- 
criminations. We shall proceed 
now to the police station, all of 
us. There, with the help of the 
Fulszime Telepath, we shall 
penetrate to the truth, and to 
the motivation behind it.” The 
policeman paused impressively, 
stared full into each man’s face, 
swallowed saliva to show su- 
preme calm, and said: “This, I 
promise you.” 

Without further ado the police- 
man, the official, the old man, 
and Marvin Flynn, proceeded to 
the police station. They walked 
silently, and they shared a com- 
mon mood of apprehension. 

It is a truism throughout the 
civilized galaxy that when you 
go to the fiolice your troubles 
really begin.

chamber were the Fulszime tele- 
path lived. This tripedal entity, 
like all of his fellows from the 
Fulszime Planet, possessed a 
telepathic sixth sense, perhaps in 
compensation for the dimness of 
his other five. 

“All right,” the Fulszime tele- 
path said, when all were as- 
sembled before him. “Step for- 
ward, fellow, and tell me your 
story.” He pointed a finger stern- 
ly at the policeman. 

“Sir!” the policeman said, 
straightening with embarrass- 
ment, “I happen to be the police- 
man.” 

“That is interesting,” the tele- 
path said. “But I fail to see what 
it has to do with the question of 
your innocence or guilt.” 

“But I am not even accused of 
a crime,” the policeman said. 

The telepath mused for a mo- 
ment, then said, “I think I un- 
derstand. It is these two who are 
accused. Is that it?” 

“It is,” the policeman said. 

“My apologies. Your aura of 
guilt led me to an over-hasty 
identification.” 

“Guilt?” the policeman said. 
“Me?” He spoke calmly, but his 
skin was showing the typical 
orange striations of anxiety. 

“Yes, you,” the telepath said. 
“You need not be surprised. 
Grand larceny is the sort of thing 
about which most intelligent 
creatures feel guilty.” 



“Now just a minute!” the 
policeman shouted. “I haven’t 
committed any grand larceny!” 
The telepath closed his eyes 
and introspected. At last he said, 
“That is correct. I meant to say 
that you will perform grand 
larceny.” 

“Clairvoyance is not admissi- 
ble as evidence in a court of 
law,” the policeman stated. “And 
furthermore, readings of the fu- 
ture are a direct violation of the 
law of free will.” 

“This is true,” the telepath 
said. “My apologies.” 

“It’s quite all right,” the police- 
man said. “When will I perform 
this alleged grand larceny?” 
“About six months hence,” the 
telepath said. 

“And will I be arrested?” 

“No. You will flee the planet, 
going to a place where there is 
no extradition law.” 

“Hmm, interesting,” the police- 
man said. “Could you tell me 
if . But we can discuss this 
later. Now you must hear the 
stories of these men, and judge 
their innocence or guilt.” 

The telepath looked at Marvin, 
shook a flipper at him, and said, 
“You may proceed.” Marvin told 
his story, beginning with his first 
reading of the advertisement, 
and leaving out nothing. 

“Thank you,” the telepath 
said, when he was through. “And 
now, sir, your story.” He turned

to the old Martian, who cleared 
his throat, scratched his thorax, 
spit once or twice, and then pro- 
ceeded. 

AIGELER THRUS’S STORY 

I don’t even know where to be- 
gin this thing, so I guess I’d 
better start with my name, which 
is Aigeler Thrus, and my race, 
which is Nemucthian Adventist, 
and my occupation, which is that 
I own and operate a clothing 
store on the planet Achelses V. 
Well, it’s a small business and 
not a very good business and my 
store is located in Lambersa on 
the South Polar Cap, and I sell 
clothing all day to immigrant 
Venusian laborers, who are big, 
green, hairy fellows, very igno- 
rant and very excitable and apt 
to fight, though I have no pre- 
judices against them. 

You get to be philosophical in 
my business, and maybe I’m not 
rich, but at least I got my health 
(thank God), and my wife Allu- 
ra is healthy too except for a 
mild case of tentacular fibrosis. 
And I got two grown sons, one 
of whom is a doctor in Sidneport, 
and the other is a trainer of 
Klannts. And I also got one 
daughter who is married, so of 
course that means I got a son- 
in-law. 

This son-in-law of mine I have 
always distrusted, since he is a 



fancy dresser and owns twenty 
pairs of chest-props, although hia 
wife my daughter hasn’t even 
got a matched set of scratchers. 
But it can’t be helped, she dug 
her burrow, now she has to crawl 
in it. But still, when a man is so 
interested in clothes and fancy- 
smelling joint lubricants and 
similar luxuries on the salary of 
a moisture salesman (he calls 
himself a hydrosensory engineer) 
it makes you wonder a little. 

And he’s always trying to 
scratch up extra income on the 
side with various foolish ventures 
which I have to equip him for 
out of my hard-earned savings 
which I get by selling to these big 
green fellows. Like last year he 
got hold of this novelty item, a 
backyard cloudmaker, and I told 
him, who would want it? But my 
wife insisted that I help him out, 
and sure enough he went broke. 
And then this year, he had an- 
other scheme, and this time it 
was iridescent synthetic wool 
seconds from Vega II, a consign- 
ment of which he somehow found 
in Heligoport and which he 
wanted me to buy. 

I said to him, “Look, what do 
my customers these Venusian 
loud-mouths know about fancy 
dressing? They’re lucky if they 
can afford a pair of twill shorts 
and maybe a robe for holidays.” 
But my son-in-law has got an 
answer for everything and he 



20 



GALAXY 



says to me, “Look, Papa, have I 
or have I not made a study of 
Venusian folkways and mores? 
The way I look at it, here are 
these people straight out of the 
backwoods, and they’ve got this 
love of ritual and dance and 
bright colors. So it’s a natural, 
true or not?” 

Well, to make a short story 
even shorter, I get talked into 
this venture against my better 
judgment. Naturally, I had to see 
those iridescent seconds myself, 
because I wouldn’t trust my son- 
in-law to judge a piece of lint. 
And that meant travelling half- 
way across the galaxy to Heligo- 
port in Mars. So I started mak- 
ing the arrangements. 

No one wanted to Swap with 
me. I can’t say I blame them, be- 
cause nobody comes on purpose 
to a planet like Achelses V, un- 
less it’s immigrant Venusians 
who don’t know any better. But 
I find this ad fronj this Martian, 
Ze Kraggash, who wants to rent 
his body out on account of he’s 
taking his mind into Cold Storage 
for a protracted rest. It’s damned 
expensive, but what can I do? I 
get a little money back by rent- 
ing my own body to a friend who 
had been a quarentz hunter be- 
fore he was bed-ridden by mus- 
cular dyscomyotosis. And I go 
down to the Swap Bureau and 
get projected to Mars. 

Well, imagine my sensations 



when it turns out there is no 
body waiting for me! Everybody’s 
running around trying to find out 
what happened to my host body, 
and they even try to send me 
back to Achelses V ; but they 
can’t because my friend has al- 
ready left on a quarentz hunting 
expedition with my body. 

Finally they get me a body 
from the Theresienstadt Rent-a- 
Body people. Twelve hours is the 
maximum they can allow me 
since they’re all booked up for 
short-term rentals through the 
summer. And it’s a pretty de- 
crepit old body, as you can see 
for yourself, and damned expen- 
sive anyhow. 

So I go out and try to find out 
what had gone wrong, and what 
do I find but this tourist from 
Earth walking around bold as 
brass in the body which I have 
paid for, and which, according to 
my contract, I should be occupy- 
ing at this very moment. 

It is not only unfair, it is also 
extremely aggravating to my 
health. And that is the entire 
story. 

nphe telepath retired to his 
chambers in order to ponder 
his decision. He returned in less 
than an hour, and spoke as fol- 
lows: 

“Both of you did, in all good 
faith, rent, swap, or otherwise ac- 
quire, the same body, vis., the 



MINDSWAP 



21 



corpus of Ze Kraggash. This body 
was offered by its owner, the 
aforesaid Ze Kraggash, to each of 
you, and thus sale was consum- 
mated in direct violation of all 
laws concerned. Ze Kraggash’s 
action must be considered crim- 
inal, both in execution and intent. 
This being the case, I have 
caused to be sent to Earth a mes- 
sage, requesting the immediate 
arrest of the aforesaid Ze Krag- 
gash, and his detention in a place 
of custody until such time as his 
extradition can be affected. 

“Both of you made your pur- 
chase in good faith. However, the 
prior, or earliest, sale, as shown in 
the contractual forms, was made 
by Mr. Aigeler Thrus, who takes 
precedence over Mr. Marvin 
Flynn by a matter of thirty- 
eight hours. Therefore Mr. Thrus, 
as the First Buyer, is awarded 
custody of the Corpus; and Mr. 
Flynn is ordered to Cease and 
Desist his unlawful occupancy, 
and to take cognizance of the 
Dispossess Notice which I here- 
by give him, and which must be 
obeyed within six standard 
Greenwich hours.” 

The telepath handed Marvin a 
Dispossess Notice. Flynn accept- 
ed it sadly, yet with resignation. 
“I suppose,” he said, “that I had 
better go back to my own body 
on Earth.” 

“That,” the telepath said, 
“would be your wisest choice. 

22 



Unfortunately, it is not possible 
at the moment.” 

“Not possible? Why not?” 

“Because,” the telepath said, 
“according to the Earth author- 
ities, whose telepathic reply I 
have just received, your body, 
animated by the mind of Ze 
Kraggash, is nowhere to be found. 
A preliminary investigation lead* 
us to fear that Ze Kraggash has 
fled the planet, taking with him 
your body and Mr. Aigeler’s 
money.” 

It took a while for it to sink 
in. But finally Marvin Flynn 
realized the implications of what 
had been said. 

He was stranded on Mars in 
an alien body, which he had to 
relinquish. In six hours, he 
would be a mind with no body 
at all, and with a poor chance of 
finding one. 

Minds cannot exist without 
bodies. Marvin Flynn slowly and 
unwillingly faced the imminence 
of his own death.

■ft /f arvin did not give way to 
despair. He gave way in- 
stead to anger, which was a much 
healthier emotion, though equal- 
ly unproductive. Instead of mak- 
ing a fool of himself by weeping 
in the court, he made a fool of 
himself by storming through the 
corridors of the Federal Build- 



GALAXY 



ing, demanding either fair play 
or a damned good substitute. 

There was no restraining this 
impetuous young man. Quite in 
vain did several lawyers point 
out to him that if justice really 
existed there would be no need 
for law and lawmakers, and thus 
one of mankind’s noblest con- 
ceptions would be obliterated 
and an entire occupational group 
would be thrown out of work. 

This lucid argument brought 
no peace to the frenzied Marvin, 
who gave every appearance of 
a man insusceptible to reason. 
The breath rasped and rattled in 
his throat as he roared his con- 
tempt for the Justice machinery 
of Mars. It was in this mood that 
he came to a door marked Bu- 
reau of Detection and Apprehen- 
sion, Interstellar Division. 

“Aha!” Marvin muttered, and 
entered the office. 

He found himself in a small 
room which looked like some- 
thing out of the pages of an old 
historical novel. Against the wall 
were dignified banks of old but 
reliable electronic calculators. 
Near the door was an early model 
thought-to-print translator. The 
arm chairs had the abrupt shape 
and pastel plastic upholstery 
which we associate with a more 
leisurely era. The room lacked 
only a bulky solid-state Moraeny 
to make it a perfect replica of a 
scene from the pages of Sheck- 



ley or one of the other early 
poets of the Age of Transmission. 

There was a middle-aged Mar- 
tian seated in a chair throwing 
darts at a target shaped like a 
woman’s bottom. 

He turned hastily when Mar- 
vin came in and said, “It’s about 
time. I was expecting you.” 

“Were you really?” Marvin 
asked. 

“Well, not really,” the Martian 
said. “But I have found that it 
makes an effective opening, and 
tends to create an atmosphere 
of trust.” 

“Then why do you ruin it by 
telling me?” 

The Martian shrugged his 
shoulder and said, “Look, no 
one’s perfect. I’m just an ordi- 
nary working detective. Urf Ur- 
dorf’s the name. Sit down. I think 
we have a lead on your missing 
fur coat.” 

4 ‘IX/hat fur coat?” Marvin 
* ’ asked. 

‘Aren’t you Madame Ripper 
de Lowe, the transvestite who 
was robbed last night in the Red 
Sands Hotel?” 

“Certainly not. I’m Marvin 
Flynn. I lost my body.” 

“Of course, of course,” Detec- 
tive Urdorf said, nodded vigor- 
ously. “Let’s take it point by 
point. Do you remember by any 
chance where you were when you 
first noticed that your body was 



MINDSWAP 



23 



missing? Could any of your 
friends have taken it as a joke? 
Or could you have merely mis- 
placed it, or perhaps sent it on a 
vacation?” 

“I didn’t really lose it,” Mar- 
vin said. “Actually, it was stolen.” 
“You should have said so in 
the first place,” Urdorf said. 
“That tends to put the matter in 
a different light. I am only a de- 
tective; I have never claimed to 
be a mindreader.” 

“I’m sorry,” Marvin said. 

“I’m sorry, too,” Detective Ur- 
dorf said. “About your body, I 
mean. It must have been quite a 
nasty shock.” 

“Yes, it was.” 

“I can well understand how 
you feel.” 

“Thank you,” Marvin said. 
They sat in companionable 
silence for several minutes. Then 
Marvin said, “Well?” 

“I beg your pardon?” the de- 
tective replied. 

“I said, ‘well?’” 

“Oh. I’m sorry, I’m afraid I 
didn’t hear you the first time.” 
“That’s quite all right.” 

“Thank you.” 

“You’re extremely welcome.” 
There was another silence. 
Then Marvin said, “Well?” once 
again, and Urdorf said, “I beg 
your pardon?” 

Marvin said, “I want it back.” 
“What?” 

“My body.” 



“Your what? Oh, yes, your 
body. Hmm, I daresay you do,” 
the detective said, with an ap- 
preciative smile. “But of course, 
it isn’t as easy as that, is it?” 

“I wouldn’t know,” Marvin 
said. 

“No, I don’t suppose you 
would,” Urdorf said. “But I can 
assure you that it isn’t as easy as 
that.” 

“I see,” Marvin said. 

“I rather hoped you would,” 
Urdorf said, and lapsed into 
silence. 

T his silence lasted for approxi- 
mately twenty-five seconds, 
give or take a second or two. At 
the end of that time Marvin’s 
patience collapsed and he shout- 
ed, “Goddam it are you going to 
do something about getting me 
back my body or are you going 
to just sit there on your goddam 
fat butt and talk without saying 
anything?” 

“Of course I am going to get 
you your body,” the detective 
said. “Or in any case, I am going 
to try. And there is no reason for 
abuse. I am not, after all, some 
machine filled with tabulated 
answers. I am an intelligent being 
just like yourself. I have my own 
hopes and fears. And I have my 
own way of conducting an inter- 
view. This way may seem inef- 
fectual to you, but I have found 
it extremely useful.”

“Have you really?” asked Mar- 
vin, chastened. 

“Why yes, as a matter of fact 
I have,” the detective replied, 
his mild voice showing no trace 
of rancor. 

Another silence seemed about 
to begin, so Marvin asked, “What 
sort of chance do you think I 
have — we have — for recover- 
ing my body?” 

“A most excellent chance,” De- 
tective Urdorf replied. “In fact, 
I think I could go so far as to 
say that I am certain of success. 
I base this not on a study of your 
particular case, about which I 
know very little, but on the sim- 
ple statistics involved.” 

“Do the statistics favor us?” 
Marvin asked. 

“Most assuredly! Consider: I 
am a trained detective, conver- 
sant with all the new methods 
and possessing a top efficiency 
rating of AA-A. Yet in spite of 
this, during my five years with 
the force, I have never solved 
a case.” 

“Not a single one?” 

“Not a single one,” Urdorf said 
firmly. “Interesting, isn’t it?” 
“Yes, I suppose it is,” Marvin 
said. “But doesn’t that mean — ” 
“It means,” the detective said, 
“that one of the strangest runs of 
bad luck that I have ever heard 
of is statistically due to break.” 
Marvin was nonplussed, which 
is an unusual sensation in a Mar- 



tian body. He said, “But suppose 
your luck doesn’t break?” 

“You must not be supersti- 
tious,” the detective replied. “The 
probabilities are there; even the 
most casual examination of the 
situation should convince you of 
that. I have been unable to solve 
one hundred and fifty- eight cases 
in a row. You are my 159th. How 
would you bet if you were a bet- 
ting man?” 

“I’d stay with the run,” Mar- 
vin said. 

C(Qo would I,” the detective 
^ admitted, with a self-dep- 
recating smile. “But we would 
be betting on emotion rather 
than on the calculations of our 
intellect.” Urdorf looked at the 
ceiling dreamily. “One hundred 
and fifty-eight failures! It’s a 
fantastic record. A run like that 
simply has to break! I could 
probably sit here in my office 
and do nothing, and the criminal 
would find his way to me.” 

“Yes sir,” Marvin said polite- 
ly. “But I hope you won’t test 
that particular approach.” 

“Well, no,” Urdorf said. “I tried 
that with number 156. No, I shall 
pursue your case actively. Espec- 
ially since it is a sex crime, which 
is the sort of thing I am interest- 
ed in.” 

“I beg your pardon?” Marvin 
said. 

“There is really no need to 

25 



MINDSWAP 



apologize,” the detective assured 
Mm. “One should not be embar- 
rassed or guilty by reason of be- 
ing the victim of a sex crime, 
even though the deepest folk wis- 
dom of many cultures attaches a 
stigma to being such a victim, 
on the presumption of conscious 
or unconscious complicity.” 

“No, no, I wasn’t apologizing,” 
Marvin said. “I was merely — ” 
“I quite understand,” the de- 
tective said, “But you mustn’t 
be ashamed to tell me all the 
bizarre and loathsome details. 
You must think of me as an im- 
personal official function instead 
erf as an intelligent being with 
sexual feeling and fears and urg- 
es and quirks and cravings — ” 
“What I was trying to tell 
you,” Marvin said, “is that there 
is no sex crime involved here.” 
“They all say that,” the detec- 
tive mused. “It is strange how 
the human mind is forever un- 
willing to accept the unaccept- 
able.” 

“Look,” Marvin said, “if you 
would take the time to read over 
the facts of the case, you would 
see that it was a case of an out- 
right swindle. Money and self- 
perpetuation were the motives.” 
“I am aware of that,” the de- 
tective said. “And, were I un- 
aware of the processes of sublim- 
ation, we could leave it at that.” 
“What possible motive could 
the criminal have had?” 

26 



“His motive is obvious,” Ur- 
dorf said. “It is a classic syn- 
drome. You see, this fellow was 
acting under a specific compul- 
sion, for which we have a spec- 
ific technical term. He was driven 
to his deed in an advanced state 
of obsessive projective narcis- 
ism.” 

“I don’t understand,” Marvin 
said. 

“It is not the sort of thing 
which the layman is apt to en- 
counter,” the detective told him. 

“What does it mean?” 

“Well, I can’t go into the en- 
tire etiology. But essentially, the 
dynamics of the syndrome in- 
volve a displaced self-love. That 
is to say; the sufferer falls in love 
with another, but not as other. 
Rather, he falls in love with the 
Other as Himself.” 

“All right,” Marvin said, with 
resignation. “Will this help us 
find the man who stole my 
body?” 

“Well, no,” said the detective. 
“But it will enable us to under- 
stand him.” 

4 4 I | ow soon can you begin?” 

1 I. Marvin asked. 

“I have already begun,” the de- 
tective replied. “I shall send for 
the court records, of course, and 
all other documents pertaining 
to this matter, and 1 shall con- 
tact all relevant planetary auth- 
orities for additional information.

I will spare no effort, and I will 
travel to the ends of the universe 
if necessary or desirable. I shall 
solve this case!” 

“I’m very glad you feel that 
way,” Marvin said. 

“One hundred and fifty-eight 
cases without a break,” Urdorf 
mused. “Have you ever heard of 
such a run of bad luck? But it 
will end here. I mean to say, it 
can’t go on indefinitely, can it?” 
“I don’t suppose that it can,” 
Marvin said. 

“I wish my superiors would 
take that view,” the detective 
said gloomily. “I wish they’d stop 
calling me ‘stumblebum.’ Words 
like that, and sneers, and lifted 
eyebrows, all tend to shake one’s 
confidence. Luckily for me, I 
have an implacable will and ut- 
ter self-confidence. Or at least I 
did have through my first ninety 
or so failures.” 

The detective brooded darkly 
for several moments, then said 
to Marvin: 

“I will expect your complete 
and utter cooperation.” 

“You shall have it,” Marvin 
said. “The only trouble is, I am 
to be dispossessed of this body in 
less than six hours.” 

“Damned awkward,” Urdorf 
said absent-mindedly. He was 
obviously thinking about his case, 
and only with difficulty did he 
turn his attention back to Mar- 
vin. “Dispossessed, eh? I suppose 



you’ve made other arrangements. 
No? Well then, I suppose you 
will make some other arrange- 
ments.” 

“I don’t know what arrange- 
ments to make,” Marvin said 
gloomily. 

“Well, no need to argue the 
matter,” the detective said, in a 
determinedly cheerful voice. 
“Find yourself another body 
somewhere; and above all, stay 
alive! I want you to promise me 
that you’ll really try your level 
best to stay alive.” 

“I promise,” Marvin said. 

“And I shall proceed with your 
case, and I will contact you as 
soon as I have anything to re- 
port.” 

“But how will you find me?” 
Marvin asked. “I don’t know 
what body I’ll be in, or even what 
planet.” 

“You forget that I am a detec- 
tive,” Urdorf said, smiling faintly. 
“I may have my troubles in find- 
ing criminals, but I have never 
experienced the slightest diffi- 
culty in finding victims. So keep 
your chin up, don’t lose the old 
moxie, and above all, remember 
to stay alive!” 

Marvin agreed to stay alive, 
since he had planned on it, any- 
how. 

And he went out into the 
street with his precious time 
flowing away and still without a 
body.

T T eadline in the Martian Sun- 
-*• News (tri-planet edition) : 

SWAP SCANDAL 

Police officials on Mars and Terra 
revealed today the existence of a Mind- 
swap scandal. Wanted for questioning 
is Ze Kraggash, species unknown, who 
allegedly sold, swapped, or otherwise 
disposed of his body to twelve Beings 
simultaneously. Warrants have been is- 
sued for Kraggash's arrest, and the po- 
lice of the tri-planet area confidently 
expect to make an announcement soon. 
The case is reminiscent of the infamous 
'Eddie Two-Head' scandal of the early 
90' s, in which . 

Marvin Flynn let the news- 
paper fall into the gutter. He 
watched as the flowing sand bore 
it away; the bitter ephemerality 
of the newsprint seemed a par- 
adigm of his own highly condi- 
tional existence. He stared at his 
hands; his head drooped. 

“ ‘Ere now, ‘ere now, what 
seems to be the trouble, eh, lad?” 
Flynn looked up into the kind- 
ly blue-green face of an Erlan. 
“I’ve got troubles,” Flynn said. 
“Well then, let’s hear ’em,” the 
Erlan said, folding himself down 
on the curb beside Flynn. Like 
all of his race, the Erlan com- 
bined a quick sympathy with 
brusque manners. Erlans were 
known as a rough, witty people, 
much given to cheerful banter 
and homely sayings. Great trav- 
ellers and traders, the Erlans of 



Erlan II were religiously required 
to travel in corpora 

Marvin told his story, right up 
to the disconsolate moment of the 
forward-surging now; the cruel 
and remorseless now, the hungry 
now, eating into his little stock 
of minutes and seconds, pressing 
forward to the time when his six 
hours would have elapsed, and 
bodyless, he would be cast into 
that unknown galaxy which men 
call death. 

“Garn!” the Erlan said. “Not 
half sorry for yourself, are you?” 
“You’re damned right I’m 
sorry for myself,” Flynn said, 
with a flash of anger. “I’d be 
sorry for anyone who was going 
to die in six hours. Why shouldn’t 
I be sorry for myself?” 

“Suit yourself, cook,” the Erlan 
said. “Some might call it bad 
form and all the bumf, but me, I 
hold with the teachings of the 
Guajuoie, who said; ‘Is it death 
which snuffles near you? Strike 
it on the snout!’ ” 

Marvin respected all religions, 
and certainly had no prejudices 
against the widespread Antides- 
cantine Rite. But he couldn’t see 
how the Guajuoie’s words could 
help him, and he said so. 

“Buck up!” the Erlan said. 
“Got yer brains and yer six hours, 
ain’t yer?” 

“Five hours.” 

“Well, then! Git up on your 
hind legs and show a little grit, 



MINDSWAP

er, cobber? Won’t do yourself 
much good maundering around 
here like a bloody old lag, will 
you now?” 

“I don’t suppose I will, really,” 
Marvin said. “And yet, what can 
I do? I have no body, and hosts 
are expensive.” 

“Too true, But did you ever 
fink of the Open Market? Eh?” 

“But that’s supposed to be 
dangerous,” Marvin said, and 
blushed at the absurdity of his 
statement. The Erlan grinned 
toughly. 

“Got the picture, eh, lad? But 
listen, it ain’t so bad as you fink, 
‘long as you buck up and take 
aholt. Open Market’s not so bad; 
been a lot of rot talked about it, 
mostly by the big swap agencies 
that wanna go on charging their 
overinflated capitalistic damned 
fees. But I know a bloke been 
working there twenty years on 
Short Shuffles, and he tells me 
most of the blokes is straight as 
a die. So keep your head and 
your chest prop tucked in tight, 
and pick yourself a good inter- 
man. Good luck, kid.” 

“Wait a moment!” Flynn cried, 
as the Erlan folded to his feet. 
“What is your friend’s name?” 

“James Virtue McHonnery,” 
the Erlan said. “He’s a tough, 
hard-bitten, narrow-minded little 
cuss, and overfond of looking 
upon the grape when it is red, and 
inclined to be smitten by black 

30 



rage when in his cups. But he 
deals flat and he serves straight, 
and you couldn’t ask no more 
than that from St. Xal himself. 
Just tell him that Pengle the 
Squib sent you, and good luck 
to you.” 

Flynn thanked the Squib 
eagerly, embarrassing that tough 
yet good-hearted gentleman. Ris- 
ing to his feet, he proceeded, 
slowly at first, then with more 
speed, toward the Quain, in the 
northwest corner of which lay 
the many stalls and open booths 
of the Open Market. And his 
hopes, previously near maximum 
entropy, began now to pulse 
modestly yet firmly with hope. 

And in the nearby gutter, tat- 
tered newspapers flowed on a 
stream of sand toward the eter- 
nal and enigmatic desert. 

UT T ev-va! Hey-ya! New bod- 
-*• ies for old! Come and be 
serviced — new bodies for old!” 

Marvin trembled when he 
heard that ancient street cry, so 
innocent in itself, yet so reminis- 
cent of dark bedtime stories. Hes- 
itantly he advanced into the 
tangled labyrinth of streets 
and alleys, or dead-ends and 
courtyards, that made up the an- 
cient Free Market Area. And as 
he walked, a dozen shouted prop- 
ositions assailed his aural recep- 
tors. 

“Harvesters wanted to harvest 

GALAXY 



the crop on Drogheda! We sup- 
ply you with a fully functional 
body complete with telepathy! 
All found, fifty credits a month, 
and a complete list of Class C-3 
pleasures! Special two-year con- 
tracts are now being let. Come 
harvest the crop on beautiful 
Drogheda!” 

“Serve in the Naigwin Army! 
Twenty NCO bodies currently on 
offer, plus a few specials in jun- 
ior officer ranks. All bodies will 
be fully equipped with Martial 
skills!” 

“What’s the pay?” a man asked 
the salesman. 

“Your keep, plus one credit a 
month.” 

The man sneered and turned 
away. 

“And,” the barker proclaimed, 
“unlimited sacking right.” 

“Well, that seems in order,” 
the man said grudgingly. “But 
the Naigwins been losing this war 
for a decade. High casualty rate, 
and not much corporeal reclama- 
tion.” 

“We’re changing all that,” the 
salesman said. “You’re an exper- 
ienced mercenary?” 

“Correct,” the man said. “The 
name is Sean Von Ardin, and I’ve 
been in just about every major 
war around, plus a fair number 
of minor ones.” 

“Last rank?” 

“Jevaldher in the army of the 
Count of Ganymede,” Von Ardin 



said. “But before that I held the 
rank of Full Cthusis.” 

“Well, well,” the salesman 
said, seemingly impressed. “Full 
Cthusis, eh? Got papers to prove 
it? Okay, tell you what I can do. 
I can offer you a position with 
the Naigwins as Manatee Leader, 
Second Class.” 

Von Ardin frowned and calcu- 
lated on his fingers. “Let’s see. 
Manatee Leader Second Class is 
the equivalent of a Cyclopiaa 
Demi-Vale, which is slightly bet- 
ter than an Anaxorean Banner 
King, and almost half a grade 
lower than a Dorian Old Boy. 
Which means . Hey, I’d lose 
an entire field grade if I joined 
you!” 

“Ah, but you didn’t hear me 
out,” the salesman continued. 
“You would hold that rank for a 
period of 25 days, to prove Purity 
of Intent, which the Naigwin 
political leaders are very big on. 
Then we would jump you three 
entire grades to Melanoan Super- 
ios, which would offer you an ex- 
cellent chance at provisional 
Lance-Jumbaya, and maybe— I 
can’t promise this, but I think I 
can swing it unofficially — maybe 
I can get you appointed Sack- 
meister for the spoils of Erids- 
vurg.” 

“Well,” Von Ardin said, im- 
pressed in spite of himself, “that’s 
a pretty decent deal — if you can 
swing it.”

“Come into the store,” the 
salesman said. “Let me make a 
phone call . 

A arvin walked on, and listened 
ivx ^- 0 men 0 f a dozen races ar- 
guing with salesmen of a dozen 
more. A hundred propositions 
were screamed in his ear. His 
spirits were stirred and uplifted 
by the vitality of the place. And 
the propositions he heard, though 
sometimes dismaying, were often 
intriguing: 

“Aphid-man wanted for the 
Senthis Swarm. Good pay, con- 
genial friendships!” 

“Rewrite man to work on the 
Dirty Book of Kavengii! Must be 
able to empathize with sexual 
premises of the Midridarian 
race!” 

“Garden planners needed for 
Arcturus! Come and relax among 
the only vegetable-sentients in 
the galaxy!” 

“Expert manacler wanted for 
Vega IV! Opportunities also for 
semi-skilled restrainers! Full pre- 
rogatives!” 

There were so many opportun- 
ities in the galaxy! It seemed to 
Marvin that his misfortune was 
perhaps a blessing in disguise. 
He had wanted to travel — but his 
modesty had permitted him no 
more than the role of tourist. 
But how much better, how much 
more gratifying it would be, to 
travel for a reason. To serve with 



the armies of Naigwin, experience 
life as an aphid-man, learn what 
it meant to be a manacler — even 
to do rewrites on the Dirty Book 
of Kavengii. 

Directly ahead of him, he 
spotted a sign which read: 
“James Virtue McHonnery, lic- 
ensed Short Shuffle Dealer. Sat- 
isfaction guaranteed.” 

Standing at the waist-high 
counter and smoking a cigar was 
a tough, hard-bitten, sour- 
mouthed little man with piercing 
cobalt-blue eyes. This could be 
none other than McHonnery 
himself. Silent and disdainful, 
scorning to spiel, the little man 
stood with arms folded as Flynn 
walked up to the booth. 

VIII 

'T'hey stood face to face, Flynn 
slack-jawed, McHonnery 
clam-mouthed. Several seconds 
of silence ensued. Then McHon- 
nery said: “Look, kid, this ain’t 
no goddam peep show and I ain’t 
no goddam freak. If you got 
something to say, spit it out. Oth- 
erwise take a walk for yourself 
before I break your back.” 

Marvin could see at once that 
this man was no fawning, honey- 
mouthed body salesman. There 
was no hint of obsequiousness in 
that rasping voice, no trace of 
ingratiation in that down-turned 
mouth. Here was a man who said 



32 



GALAXY 



what he wanted to say, and took 
no heed of the consequences. 

“I — I am a client,” Flynn said. 

“Big deal,” McHonnery 
harshed. “Am I supposed to turn 
handsprings or something?” 

His sardonic retort and blunt, 
inner-airected demeanor gave 
Flynn a sensation of confidence. 
He knew, of course, that appear- 
ances could be deceiving; but no 
one had ever told him what to 
judge by instead of appearances. 
He was inclined to trust this 
proud and bitter man. 

“I am going to be dispossessed 
of this body in a matter of hours,” 
Marvin explained. “Since my 
own body has been stolen, I am 
in desperate need of a substitute. 
I have very little money, but I — 
I am quite willing and prepared 
to work.” 

McHonnery stared at him, and 
a sardonic grin twisted the man’s 
tight lips. “Prepared to work, 
huh? Ain’t that nice! And just 
what are you prepared to work 
at?" 

“Why — anything.” 

“Yeah? Can you operate a 
Montcalm metal lathe with light- 
sensitive switchboard and man- 
vi .: j ! cull? No? Think you could 
handle a Quick-Greeze Particle 
Separator for the Rare Earths 
Novelty Company? Not your 
soil of thing, huh? I got a sur- 
geon on Vega who wants some- 
body to run his Nerve-Impulse- 



Rejection Simulator — the old 

model with the double pedals. 
Not exactly what you had in 
mind? Well, we got a jazz band 
on Potemkin II which needs a 
stomachhorn man, and a restau- 
rant near Bootes which could use 
a short-order cook, with working 
knowledge of Cthensis specialties. 
Doesn’t ring a bell? Maybe you 
could pick flowers on Moriglia; 
of course, you’d have to be able 
to predict anthesis without more 
than a five-second variation. Or 
you could do spot-flesh-welding, 
if you’ve got the nerves for it, or 
boss a phylopod reclamation pro- 
ject, or draw up intermediate 
creeper systems, or — But I don’t 
guess none of them strike your 
fancy, huh?” 

Flynn shook his head and 
mumbled, “I don’t know any- 
thing about any of those jobs.” 

CiQomehow,” McHonnery said, 

^ “that doesn’t surprise me 
as much as you might think. Is 
there anything you can do?” 

“Well, in college I was study- 
ing — ” 

“Don’t give me your goddam 
life story! I’m interested in your 
trade, skill, talent, profession, 
ability, whatever you want to call 
it. What, specifically, can you 
do?” 

“Well,” Marvin said, “I guess 
when you put it that way, I can’t 
do anything much.” 



MINDSWAP

“I know,” McHonnery said, 
sighing. “You’re unskilled. It’s 
written all over you. Kid, it may 
interest you to know that un- 
skilled minds are common as dirt, 
commoner. The market’s glutted 
with them, the universe is cram- 
med to overflowing with them. 
There is nothing you can do that 
a machine can’t do better, faster, 
and a damn sight more cheer- 
fully.” 

“I’m sorry to hear that, sir,” 
Marvin said, sadly but with dig- 
nity. He turned to go. 

“Just a minute,” McHonnery 
said. “I thought you wanted to 
work.” 

“But you said — ” 

“I said you were unskilled, 
which you are. And I said that a 
machine can do anything you can 
do better, faster, and more cheer- 
fully; but not more cheaply.” 

“Oh,” Marvin said. 

“Yep, in the cheapness depart- 
ment, you still got an edge over 
the gadgets. And that’s quite an 
achievement in this day and age.” 

“I suppose there’s a certain 
comfort in that,” Flynn said 
doubtfully. “And of course, it’s 
very interesting. But when Pengle 
the Squib told me to see you, I 
thought — ” 

“Hey, how’s that?” McHonnery 
said. “You’re a friend of the 
Squib?” 

“You might say that,” Flynn 
said, avoiding an outright lie. 

34 



“You should have told me that 
in the first place,” McHonnery 
said. “Not that it would have 
changed anything, since the facts 
are exactly as I have stated them. 
But I’d have told you that there’s 
no shame in being unskilled. Hell, 
all of us have to start out that 
way, don’t we? If you do well on 
a Short Shuffle contract, you’ll 
pick up skills in no time.” 

“I hope so, sir,” Flynn said, 
growing cautious now that Mc- 
Honnery had become affable. 
“Do you have a job in mind for 
me?” 

“As a matter of fact, I do,” Mc- 
Honnery said. “It’s a one-week 
Shuffle, which, even if you don’t 
like it, you could do standing on 
your head. Not that you should 
have to, since it’s a pleasant and 
compatible job, combining mild 
outdoor exercise with modest in- 
tellectual stimulation, all in a 
framework of good working con- 
ditions, enlightened management 
and a congenial working force.” 
“It sounds marvelous,” Flynn 
said. “What’s wrong with it?” 
“Well, it’s not the sort of job 
you can get rich at,” McHonnery 
said. “In fact, the pay is lousy. 
But what the hell, you can’t have 
everything.” 

“What is the job?” Marvin 
asked. 

“The official job title is Ooth- 
eca Indagator, Second Class.” 
“That sounds impressive.”

“Glad that you like it. It means 
that you hunt for eggs.” 

“Eggs?” 

“Eggs. Or to be more specific, 
you hunt for and, upon finding, 
collect, the eggs of the Rook Gan- 
zer. Think you can swing it?” 
“Well, I’d like to know a little 
more about the techniques util- 
ized for the collecting, and also 
about job conditions, and — ” 

Tie stopped because McHon- 
nery was slowly, sadly shak- 
ing his head. “You want the job?’’ 
“Do you have anything else 
available?” 

“No.” 

“I’ll take it” 

“You’ve made a smart deci- 
sion,” McHonnery said. He took 
a paper out of his pocket. “Here 
is the standard government-ap- 
proved contract, written in Kro- 
Melden, which is the official lan- 
guage of the planet Melde II, 
wherein is licensed the employ- 
ing company. Can you read Kro- 
Melden?” 

“I’m afraid not.” 

“Well, it’s just standard stuff 
. Company not being respon- 
sible for fire, earthquake, atomic 
warfare, sun going nova, acts of 
god or gods . Company agrees 
to hire you . furnish you with 
a Melde body . unless it finds 
itself unable to do so, in which 
case it won’t . and may God 
have mercy on your soul.” 



“I beg your pardon?” Flynn 
asked. 

“The last is just the standard 
invocation. Let me see, I think 
that about covers it. Your guar- 
antee, of course, not to commit 
acts of sabotage, espionage, ir- 
reverance, disobedience, etc., and 
to furthermore eschew and desist 
from the practices of sexual per- 
version as defined in Hoffmeyer’s 
Standard Manual of Melden Per- 
versions. And you also guarantee 
to wash once every two days, and 
to stay out of debt, and not to 
become an alcoholic or insane 
person, and various other things 
to which no reasonable person 
could possibly object. And that 
about sums it up. If you have any 
important questions, I’ll endeavor 
to answer them for you.” 

“Well,” Flynn said, “about 
those things I’m supposed to 
guarantee — ” 

“That’s unimportant,” Me 
Honnery said. “Do you want the 
job or not?” 

Marvin had his doubts. 

The next thing he knew, he was 
in a Melden body, on Melde. 

IX 

T he g a n z e r rain-forest on 
Melde was deep and wide. 
The faintest ghost of a breeze 
whispered among the colossal 
trees, slithered through the inter- 
locked vines, and crept broken-

backed over hook-edged grass. 
Drops of water slid painfully 
down, and around the tangled 
foliage like exhausted runners of 
a maze coming to rest at last in 
the spongy and indifferent soil. 
Shadows mingled and danced, 
faded and reappeared, called in- 
to spurious motion by two tired 
suns in a moldy green sky. Over- 
head, a desolate therengol whis- 
tled for his mate, and heard in 
reply the quick ominous cough 
of a predatory kingspringer. 

And through this dolorous 
woodland, so tantalizingly like 
Earth and yet so different, Mar- 
vin Flynn moved in his unfamil- 
iar Melden body, his eyes down- 
cast, searching for ganzer eggs 
but not knowing what they 
looked like. 

All had been haste. From the 
moment he arrived on Melde, he 
had barely had a chance to take 
stock of himself. No sooner was 
he bodified than someone was 
barking orders in his ear. 

Flynn had just had time to 
look hastily over his four-armed, 
four-legged body, give his tail a 
single experimental flick and 
fold his ears across his back; 
then he was herded into a work 
gang, given a barracks number 
and a mess hall location and 
handed a jumper two sizes too 
big for him, and shoes which fit- 
ted tolerably well except for the 
left front. He signed for and was 



given the tools of his new trade: 
a large plastic bag, dark glasses, 
a compass, a net, a pair of tongs, 
a heavy metal tripod and a blast- 
er. 

He and his fellow-workers 
were then assembled in ranks, 
and received a hasty indoctrina- 
tion by the manager, a bored and 
supercilious Atreian. 

Flynn learned that his new 
home occupied an insignificant 
portion of space in the vicinity 
of Aldeberan. Melde was a thor- 
oughly second-rate world. Its 
climate was rated “intolerable” 
on the Hurlihan-Chanz Climatic 
Tolerance Scale; its natural re- 
source potentiality was classified 
“submarginal,” and its esthetic 
resonance factor (unweighted) 
was given as “unprepossessing.” 
“Not the sort of place,” the 
manager said, “that one would 
choose for a vacation; or indeed 
for anything.” 

His audience tittered uneasily. 
“Nevertheless,” the manager 
continued, “this unloved and un- 
lovely place, this solar misfor- 
tune, this cosmic mediocrity, is 
home to its inhabitants, who con- 
sider it the finest place in the 
universe.” 

'T'he Meldens, with a fierce 
pride in their only tangible as- 
set, had made the best of their 
bad bargain. With the plucky 
determination of the eternally

unlucky, they had farmed the 
edges of the rain forest and col- 
lected meager low-yield ores 
from the vast blazing deserts. 
Their dogged persistence would 
have been inspiring — had it not 
invariably ended in failure. 

Said the manager, “This is 
what Melde would be were it not 
for one additional factor. Ganzer 
eggs! No other planet possesses 
them; no other planet so desper- 
ately needs them.” 

Ganzer eggs were the sole ex- 
port of the planet Melde. And 
luckily for the Meldens, the eggs 
were always in heavy use. On 
Orichades, ganzer eggs were uti- 
lized as love-objects; on Ophiu- 
chus II, they were ground up and 
eaten as a sovereign aphrodisiac; 
on Morichades, after consecra- 
tion, they were worshipped by 
the irrational K’tengi. 

Thus, ganzer eggs were a vital 
natural resource — and the only 
one which the Meldens possessed. 
With them, the Meldens could 
maintain a tolerable degree of 
civilization. Without them, the 
race would surely perish. 

To acquire a ganzer egg, all 
one had to do was pick it up. 
But therein lay certain difficul- 
ties, since the ganzers objected to 
this practice. 

The ganzers were forest dwell- 
ers, remotely of lizard origin. 
They also were destroyers, clever 
at concealment, wily and feroc- 



ious, and completely untamable. 
These qaulities rendered the col- 
lection of ganzer eggs extremely 
perilous. 

“It is a curious situation,” the 
manager pointed out, “and not 
without its paradoxical over- 
tones. The main source of life on 
Melde is also the main cause of 
death. It is something for you all 
to think about as you begin your 
work-day. And so I say, take 
good care of yourselves, keep 
guarded at all times, look before 
you leap, observe every precau- 
tion with your indentured lives, 
and also with the costly bodies 
which have been entrusted to 
your keeping. But in addition, 
remember that you must fulfill 
your norm, since every day’s 
work unfulfilled by so much as a 
single egg is penalized by the 
addition of an additional week. 
Good luck, boys!” Marvin and 
his fellow workers were then 
formed into ranks and marched 
into the forest on the double. 

\ T rithin an hour they reached 
* * their search area. Marvin 
Flynn took this opportunity to 
ask the foreman for instructions. 

“Instructions?” the foreman 
asked. “What kind of type in- 
structions?” (He was an Orina- 
thian deportee with no language 
aptitude.) 

“I mean,” Flynn said, “what 
am I supposed to do?”

The foreman pondered the 
question and at length respond- 
ed ‘You supposed pick eggs of 
ganzer.” (He pronounced it ‘gun- 
tser.’) 

“I understand that,” Flynn 
said, “But I mean to say, I don’t 
even know what a ganzer egg 
looks like.” 

“Not to worry,” the foreman 
replied. “You know when see no 
mistake, yes.” 

“Yes sir,” Marvin said. “And 
when I find a ganzer egg, are 
there any special rules for handl- 
ing it? I mean to say, is break- 
age a problem, or — ” 

“To handle,” the foreman said, 
“you pick up egg, put in bag. You 
understand this thing yes no?” 

“Of course I do,” Marvin said. 
“But also, I would like to know 
about daily quota expectations. 
Is there some sort of a quota 
system? Perhaps a n hourly 
breakdown?” 

“Ah!” said the foreman, a look 
of comprehension finally cross- 
ing his broad, good-natured face. 
“Of finish is like this. You pick 
ganzer egg, put in bag, check?” 

“Check,” Marvin said instant- 
ly- 

“You do so time after time un- 
til bag is full. Catch?” 

“I believe I do,” Marvin said. 
“The full bag represents the 
actual or ideal quota. Let me 
just go over the steps again to 
make absolutely sure I’ve got it. 



First, I locate the ganzer eggs, 
applying Terran associations to 
the concept, and presumably 
having no difficulty in identifica- 
tion. Second, having located and 
identified the desired object, I 
proceed to ‘put it in my basket,’ 
by which I assume that — ” 

“Wait minute.” The foreman 
tapped his teeth with his tail and 
said, “You put me on, huh, kid?” 

“Well, sir, I merely wished to 
ascertain — ” 

“You make big joke on old- 
planet Orinathian yokel. You 
think you so smart. You ain’t so 
smart. Remember — nobody likes 
wise guy.” 

“I’m sorry,” Flynn said, swish- 
ing his tail deferentially. 

“Anyhow, me I tink you catch 
elementary rudiments of job all 
right so you go now perform 
work-labor big. Keep nose clean. 
Or I break six or more of your 
limbs, dig?” 

“Dig,” said Flynn, wheeled 
and cantered into the forest and 
there began his search. 

X 

IV /T arvin Flynn slid silently 
through the forest, his nos- 
trils flared wide, his eyes extend- 
ed and swivelling, their blink- 
rate reduced. His golden hide, 
scented faintly with appisthyme, 
twitched sensitively as his great 
muscles moved beneath it, ap- 
parently relaxed yet poised.

GALAXY 



The forest was a symphony of 
greens and grays, cut through 
with the occasional scarlet theme 
of a creeper, or the purple 
flourish of a lillibabba shrub, or 
rarer still, the haunting oboe 
countermelody of an orange 
whipwhinger. Yet the effect was 
essentially somber and thought 
provoking, like a vast amusement 
park in the silent hour before 
dawn. 

But there! Right over there! A 
little to the left! Yes, yes, just 
b -neath the boku tree! Is that 
. Could it be ... 

Flynn parted the leaves with 
his right arms and bent low. 
There, in a nest of grass and 
woven twigs, he saw something 
that glittered like an ostrich egg 
encrusted with precious gems. 

The foreman had been right. 
There could be no mistaking a 
ganzer egg. 

A million fairy fires burned 
bright in the curved and multi- 
hued ganzer surface. Shadows 
drifted across it like half re- 
membered dreams, twisting and 
turning. An emotion welled up 
in Marvin of twilight and even- 
song, of slow cattle grazing near 
a crystal brook, of dusty, heart- 
broken cypresses. 

Although it wrenched his sen- 
sibilities to do so, Marvin bent 
down and reached out. His hand 
folded lovingly around the glow- 
ing orb. 



He pulled his hand back 
quickly. The glowing orb was 
hotter than hell. 

Marvin looked at it with new 
respect. Now he understood the 
purpose of the tongs with which 
he had been equipped. He closed 
them gently on the spheroid of 
dreams. 

The sphere of dreams bounced 
away from him like a rubber 
ball. Marvin galloped after it, 
fumbling with his net. The gan- 
zer egg twisted and ricocheted, 
and bolted for thick underbrush. 

Marvin cast his net in despera- 
tion and fortune guided his hand. 
The ganzer egg was neatly net- 
ted. 

It lay quietly, pulsating as 
though out of breath. Marvin ap- 
proached it cautiously, ready for 
any trick. 

Instead the ganzer egg spoke. 
“Look, mister,” it said in a muf- 
fled voice. “Just what’s eating 
you?” 

(CT)eg pardon?” Marvin said. 

* * “Look,” the ganzer egg 
said, “I am sitting here in a pub- 
lic park minding my own business 
when suddenly you come up and 
pounce on me like a lunatic, 
bruising me and acting like some 
kind of nut. Well, naturally I get 
a little hot. Who wouldn’t? So I 
decide to move away because 
it’s my day off and I don’t want 
no trouble. So you up and throw

a net arovnd me like I was a 
goddam butterfly or something. 
So I just want to know, what’s 
the big idea?” 

“Well,” Marvin said, “you see, 
you’re a ganzer egg.” 

“I’m aware of that,” the gan- 
ger egg said. “Sure I’m a ganzer 
egg. Is there a law against that 
all of a sudden?” 

“Certainly not,” Marvin said. 
“But as it happens, I am hunting 
ganzer eggs.” 

There was a short silence. Then 
the ganzer egg said, “Would you 
mind repeating that?” 

Marvin did. The ganzer egg 
said, “Mmm, that’s what I 
thought you said.” He laughed 
feebly. “You’re kidding, aren’t 
you?” 

“Sorry, I’m not.” 

“Sure you are,” the ganzer egg 
said, a note of desperation in his 
voice. “So okay, you’ve had your 
fun. Now let me out of here.” 
“Sorry . .” 

“Let me out!” 

“I can’t.” 

“Why?” 

“Because I’m hunting ganzer 
eggs.” 

“My God,” the ganzer egg said, 
“this is the craziest thing I’ve 
ever heard in my life. You never 
met me before, did you? So why 
are you hunting me?” 

“I’ve been hired to hunt ganzer 
eggs,” Marvin told him. 

“Look, fella, you just go around 



hunting any ganzer eggs a? s'i? 
You don’t care which one?" 
“That’s right.” 

“And you aren’t really looking 
for one particular ganzer egg who 
maybe did you a bad turn?” 

“No, no,” Marvin said. “I’ve 
never even met a ganzer egg be- 
fore.” 

“You’ve never . And yet you 
hunt ... I must be going out of 
my mind, I can’t be hearing right. 
I mean, things like this just don’t 
happen. It’s like some kind of an 
incredible nightmare . some 
crazy-looking guy walking up 
calm as you please and grabbing 
you and saying, dead-pan, ‘I hap- 
pen to be hunting for ganzer 
eggs.’ I mean — look, fella, you 
are putting me on, aren’t you?” 

1\ jf arvin was embarrassed and 
-*-*-*• exasperated, and he wished 
the ganzer egg would shut up. He 
said gruffly, “I’m not fooling. My 
job is to collect ganzer eggs.” 
“Collect . ganzer eggs!” the 
ganzer egg moaned, “Oh no, no, 
no, no! My God, I can’t believe 
this is happening, and yet it real- 
ly is happening, it really is — ” 
“Control yourself,” Marvin 
said; the ganzer egg was clearly 
on the thin edge of hysteria. 

“Thank you,” the ganzer egg 
said, after a moment. “I’m all 
right now. Look, could I ask you 
just one question?” 

“Hurry it up,” Marvin said. 



40 



GALAXY 



“The thing I want to ask,” the 
ganzer egg said, “do you get some 
kind of a charge out of this sort 
of thing? I mean are you some 
sort of pervert? I don’t mean to 
be insulting.” 

“That’s all right,” Marvin said. 
“No, I’m not a pervert, and I can 
assure you I take no pleasure in 
this. Believe me, I’m finding it 
very strange.” 

“You’re finding it strange!” the 
ganzer egg said, his voice rising to 
a scream. “How do you think I 
feel ? Do you think maybe I think 
it’s natural for someone to come 
along like a nightmare and col- 
lect me?” 

“Steady,” Marvin said. 

“Crazy,” the ganzer egg whis- 
pered to himself. “He’s absolute- 
ly and completely insane. May — 
may I leave a note for my wife?” 

“There isn’t time,” Marvin said 
fii'mly. 

“Then will you at least let me 
say my prayers?” 

“Go ahead and say them,” 
Marvin said. “But you’ll really 
have to be quick about it.” 

“Oh Lord God,” the ganzer egg 
intoned. “I don’t know what is 
happening to me, or why. I have 
always tried to be a good person, 
and although I am not a regular 
churchgoer, You surely know that 
true religion is in the heart. I’ve 
maybe done some bad things in 
my life, I won’t deny it. But 
Lord, why this punishment? Why 



me? Why not someone else, one 
of the real bad ones, one of the 
criminals? Why me? And why 
like this? Something is collecting 
me like I’m some sort of a thing 
. and I don’t understand. But 
I know that You are All-Wise 
and All-Powerful, and I know 
that You are good, so I guess 
there must be a reason . even 
if I’m too stupid to see it. So 
look, God, if this is it, then okay, 
this is it. But could you look after 
my wife and kids? And could you 
especially look after the little 
one?” The ganzer egg’s voice 
broke, but he recovered almost 
at once. “I ask especially for the 
little one, God, because he’s lame 
and the other kids pick on him 
and he needs a lot — a lot of love. 
Amen.” 

The ganzer egg choked back 
his sobs. His voice became ab- 
ruptly stronger. 

“I’m ready now,” he said to 
Marvin. “Do your damnedest, 
you lousy son-of-a-bitch.” 

T>ut the prayer of the ganzer 
* * egg had unmanned Marvin 
completely. With eyes wet and 
fetlocks trembling, Marvin op- 
ened the net and released his 
captive. The ganzer egg rolled 
out a little distance and then 
stopped, clearly fearing a trick. 

“You — you really mean this?” 
he asked. 

“I do,” Marvin said. “I was

MINDSWAP 



never cut out for this kind of 
work. I don’t know what they 
will do to me back at the Camp, 
but I shall never gather a single 
ganzer egg!” 

“Praise be the name of the 
Lord,” the ganzer egg said soft- 
ly. “I’ve seen a few strange things 
in my time, but it seems to me 
that the Hand of Providence — ” 

The hypothesis of the ganzer 
egg(known as the Intervention- 
alist Fallacy) was interrupted by 
a sudden ominous crashing in the 
underbrush. Marvin whirled, and 
remembered the dangers of the 
planet Melde. 

He had been warned, but had 
forgotten. And now, desperately, 
he fumbled for his blaster, which 
had become entangled in his net. 
Violently he wrenched at it, 
pulled it free, heard a shrill cry 
from the ganzer egg — 

And then he was flung violently 
to the ground. The blaster spun 
away into the underbrush. And 
Marvin gazed up into slit black 
eyes beneath a low armored fore- 
head. 

No introductions were necess- 
ary. Flynn knew that he had met 
a full-grown adult marauding 
ganzer, and had met him under 
possibly the worst of all circum- 
stances. The evidence was all too 
evident; the damning net, the 
tell-tale sunglasses, the revealing 
tongs. And closer still — closing on 
his neck — was the tooth-edged 



jaw of the gigantic saurian, so 
close that Marvin could see three 
gold molars and a temporary por- 
celain filling. 

Flynn tried to wriggle free. 
The ganzer pressed him back 
with a paw the size of a yak sad- 
dle; his cruel claws, each the size 
of a pair of ice tongs, bit cruelly 
into Marvin’s golden hide. The 
slavering jaws gaped hideously, 
descended, about to engulf his 
entire head . 

XI 

Ouddenly time stopped! Marvin 
^ saw the ganzer’s jaws arrest- 
ed in mid-slaver, his bloodshot 
left eye fixed in mid-blink, and 
his entire great body gripped in a 
strange and unyielding rigidity. 

Nearby, the ganzer egg was as 
motionless as a carven replica of 
itself. 

The breeze was stopped in 
mid- career. Trees were caught in 
straining postures, and a merith- 
eian hawk was fixed in mid-flight 
like a dummy attached to a wire. 

The sun stopped its inexorable 
rolling flight! 

And in this strange tableau, 
Marvin stared with tremendous 
sensations in the direction of a 
single movement in the air three 
feet above his head and slightly 
to his left. 

It began as a whorl of dust — 
broadened, expanded, expatiated, 



42 



GALAXY 



thickening at the base and be- 
coming convex at the apex. The 
rotation came faster, and the fig- 
ure solidified. 

“Detective Urdorf!” Marvin 
cried. For it was indeed the Mar- 
tian detective with a streak of 
bad luck who had promised to 
solve Marvin’s case and to return 
to him his rightful body. 

“Terribly sorry to barge in like 
this,” Urdorf said, materializing 
fully and falling heavily to the 
ground. 

“Thank God you have come!” 
Marvin said. “You have saved 
me from an extremely unpleasant 
fate, and now if you will help me 
out from under this creature — ” 

For Marvin was still pinned to 
the ground by the ganzer’s paw, 
which had taken on the rigidity 
of tempered steel. From beneath 
it he was unable to wriggle. 

“Sorry,” the detective said, get- 
ting up and dusting himself off. 
“I’m afraid I can’t do that.” 

“Why not?” 

“Against the rules,” Detective 
Urdorf told him. “Any displace- 
ment of bodies during an arti- 
ficial induced temporal stoppage 
(which is what this is) could re- 
sult in a Paradox, which is for- 
bidden since it might result in a 
temporal implosion which might 
conceivably hove the result of 
warping the structure-lines of our 
continuum and thus destroy the 
universe. Because of this, any dis- 



placement is punishable by a 
prison sentence of one year and 
a fine of one thousand dollars.” 
“Oh, I didn’t know that.” 
“Well, I’m afraid that’s how it 
is,” the detective said. 

“I see,” Marvin said. 

“I rather hoped you would,” 
the detective said. 

There was a long and uncom- 
fortable silence. Then Marvin 
said, “Well?” 

“Beg pardon?” 

“I said ... I meant to say, why 
did you come here?” 

“Oh,” the detective said. “I 
wished to ask you several ques- 
tions which had not occurred to 
me earlier, and which would as- 
sist me in the rigorous investiga- 
tion and solution of this case.” 
“Ask away,” Marvin said. 
“Thank you. First and fore- 
most, what is your favorite col- 
or?” 

“Blue.” 

“But exactly what shade of 
blue? Please try to be exact.” 
“Robin’s- egg blue.” 

“Hmmm.” The detective noted 
it down in his notebook. “And 
now, tell me quickly and without 
thinking, what is the first num- 
ber that comes into your mind?” 
“87792.3,” Marvin replied with- 
out hesitation. 

“Um hum. And now, without 
reflection, tell me the name of 
the first popular song you can 
think of.”

“Orang-Utan Rhapsody,” Mar- 
vin said. 

“Ummmm. Fine,” Urdorf said, 
snapping his notebook shut. “I 
think that covers everything.” 

was the purpose of 
* ' those questions?” 

“With this information, I will 
be able to test various suspects 
for corpus-vestigial responses. It 
is part of the Duulman self-iden- 
tity quiz.” 

“Oh,” Marvin said. “Have you 
had any luck yet?” 

“Luck hardly enters into it,” 
Urdorf replied. “But I can say 
that the case is proceeding in a 
satisfactory manner. We traced 
the thief to Iorama II, where he 
smuggled himself into a cargo- 
load of flash-frozen beef destined 
for Goera Major. On Goera he 
represented himself as a fugitive 
from Hage XI, which won him a 
good deal of popular favor. He 
managed to raise enough money 
for fare to Kvanthis, where he 
had cached his money. Staying no 
more than a day on Kvanthis, he 
boarded the local to the Fifty- 
stars Autonomous Region.” 

“And then?” Marvin asked. 
“Then we lost track of him 
temporarily. Fiftystars Region 
contains no less than 432 plane- 
tary systems with a combined 
population of 300 billion. So as 
you can see, our work is cut out 
for us.” 



“It sounds hopeless,” Marvin 
said. 

“Quite the contrary, it is a very 
good break for us. Laymen al- 
ways mistake complication for 
complexity. But our criminal will 
find no safety in mere multiplic- 
ity, which is always susceptible 
to statistical analysis.” 

“So what happens now?” Mar- 
vin asked. 

“We continue analyzing, and 
then we make a projection based 
upon the probabilities, and then 
we send our projection across the 
galaxy and see if it goes nova . 
I am speaking figuratively, of 
course.” 

“Of course,” Marvin said. “Do 
you really think you’ll catch 
him?” 

“I am fully confident of the re- 
sults,” Detective Urdorf said. 
“But you must have patience. 
You must remember that inter- 
galactic crime is still a relatively 
new field, and therefore inter- 
galactic investigation is newer 
still. There have been many 
crimes in which even the exist- 
ence of a criminal could not be 
proven, much less detected. So 
in some respects, we are ahead of 
the game.” 

“I guess I’ll have to take your 
word for it,” Marvin said. “But 
about this situation I’m in at 
present — ” 

“It is the very sort of situation 
I have told you to avoid,” the 



44 



GALAXY 



detective said severely. “Please 
remember that in the future — if 
you should manage to come out 
of this alive. Good luck, my 
friend.” 

Before Marvin’s eyes, Detective 
Urdorf revolved, faster, faster, 
grew dimmer, and disappeared. 

Time unfroze. 

And Marvin gazed up again in- 
to the Ganzer’s slit black eyes 
and low armored forehead, and 
saw the hideous gaping jaws 
descending, about to engulf his 
entire head — 

XII 

UVItat!” Marvin shouted. 

’ ’ “What for?” the ganzer 
asked. 

Marvin hadn’t thought that far. 
He heard the ganzer egg mutter- 
ing, “Turn-about’s fair play. And 
yet, he was kind to me. Still, 
what business is it of mine? Stick 
your neck out, somebody cracks 
your shell. And yet . 

“I don’t want to die,” Marvin 
said. 

“I didn’t suppose you did,” the 
rock ganzer said, in a not-un- 
friendly voice. “And, of course, 
you want to discuss it with me. 
Ethics, morals, the whole bit. 
But I’m afraid not. We were 
specifically warned, you see, 
never to allow a Melden to talk. 
We were told to just do the job 
and get it over with; not to per- 



sonalize it. Just do it and get on 
to the next bit of work. Mental 
hygiene, really. Therefore, if you 
would close your eyes . 

The jaws moved closer. But 
Marvin, filled with wild surmise, 
cried out: “Did you say job?” 

“Of course, it’s a job,” the gan- 
zer said. “There’s nothing per- 
sonal in it.” He frowned, appar- 
ently annoyed at himself for hav- 
ing spoken. 

“A job! Your job is to hunt 
Meldens, is that it?” 

“Well, obviously. This planet 
of Ganzer isn’t good for much, 
you see, except for hunting Mel- 
dens.” 

“But why do you hunt them?” 
Marvin asked. 

“Well, for one thing, a ganzer 
egg can grow to full maturity 
only in the host-flesh of the adult 
Melden.” 

“I say,” the ganzer egg said, 
rolling around with embarrass- 
ment, “must we get so damned 
biological? I mean to say, you 
don’t hear me talking about your 
natural functions, do you?” 

“And secondly,” the ganzer 
continued, “our sole export is 
Melde hides, which are used for 
imperial vestments on Triana II, 
for good-luck charms on Nemo 
and for seat covers on Chrysler 
XXX. This quest for the elusive 
and deadly Melden is our sole 
means of maintaining a tolerable 
degree of civilization, and — ”

“That’s exactly what they told 
me!” Marvin cried, and quickly 
repeated what the manager had 
said to him. 

“My gosh!” said the ganzer. 

Both realized the true situa- 
tion now; that the Meldens were 
utterly dependent upon the Gan- 
zers, who in turn were utterly 
dependent upon the Meldens. 
These two races hunted each 
other, lived and died for each 
other, and, through ignorance of 
guile, ignored any relationship 
between each other. The rela- 
tionship was utterly symbiotic, 
but completely unacknowledged 
by either race. In fact, each race 
pretended that it alone was a 
Civilized Intelligence, and that 
the other was bestial, contemp- 
tible and of no account. 

And it now occurred to both 
of them that they were, in equal 
measure, participants in the gen- 
eral concept of Humanity. 

'T'he realization was awesome; 

but Marvin was still pinned 
to the ground by the ganzer’s 
heavy paw. 

“This leaves me in a somewhat 
embarrassing situation,” the gan- 
zer said, after a while. “My nat- 
ural tendency is to release you. 
But I am working on this planet 
under a contract, which stip- 
ulates — ” 

“Then you are not a real gan- 
zer?” 



“No. I am a Swapper like your- 
self, and I come from Terra!” 

“My home planet!” Marvin 
cried. 

“I had guessed as much!” the 
ganzer replied. “An American. 
Probably from the East Coast, 
perhaps from Connecticut or Ver- 
mont — ” 

“New York State!!” Marvin 
cried. “I am from Stanhope!” 

“And I am from Saranac 
Lake,” the ganzer said. “My 
name is Otis Dagobert, and I am 
37 years old.” 

And with that, the ganzer lift- 
ed his paw from Marvin’s chest. 
“We are neighbors,” he said 
quietly. “And so I cannot kill 
you, just as I am reasonably sure 
you would be unable to kill me, 
had you the opportunity. And 
now that we know the truth, I 
doubt if we will be able to per- 
form any portion of our terrible 
jobs. But that is a sad thing to 
find out, for it means that we are 
doomed to Contractual Disci- 
pline; and then if we do not obey, 
our Companies will give us Ex- 
treme Severance. And you know 
what that means.” 

Marvin nodded sadly. He knew 
all too well. His head drooped, 
and he sat in disconsolate silence 
beside his newly found friend. 

“I can think of no way out,” 
Marvin said, after giving the mat- 
ter some thought. “Perhaps we 
could hide in the forest for a 



46 



GALAXY 



few days; but they would be sure 

to find us.” 

Suddenly, the ganzer egg spoke 
up. “Come now, perhaps it isn’t 
as hopeless as you think!” 

“What do you mean?” Marvin 
asked. 

“Well now,” the ganzer egg 
said, dimpling with pleasure, “it 
seems to me that one good turn 
deserves another. I could get into 
plenty of hot water for this . 
But to hell with that. I think I 
can find a way off this planet.” 

Both Marvin and Otis broke 
into exclamations of gratitude; 
but the ganzer egg stopped them 
at once. 

“Maybe you won’t thank me 
when you see what lies ahead,” 
he said ominously. 

“Nothing could be worse than 
this,” Otis said. 

“You’d be surprised,” the gan- 
zer egg said flatly. “You might 
be very surprised . This way, 
gentlemen.” 

“But where are we going?” 
Marvin asked. 

“I’m taking you to meet the 
Hermit,” the ganzer egg replied, 
and would say no more. He 
rolled purposefully away, and 
Marvin and Otis followed. 

XIII 

nphrough the rain forest wild 
and free they marched and 
rolled, ever alert for danger. But 



no creature menaced them, and 
they came at last to a clearing 
in the forest. 

Here they saw a rude hut in 
the center of that clearing, and 
a humaniform creature dressed 
all in rags squatting in front of 
the hut. 

“That is the Hermit,” said the 
ganzer egg. “He’s quite insane.” 

The two Terrans had no time 
in which to consider that infor- 
mation. The Hermit arose and 
cried, “Now stand, hold, halt! 
Reveal yourselves to my under- 
standing!” 

“I’m Marvin Flynn,” Marvin 
said, “and this is my friend Otis 
Dagobert. We want to escape 
from this planet.” 

The Hermit didn’t seem to 
hear them; he stroked his long 
beard and gazed thoughtfully at 
the treetops. In low, somber 
tones, he said: 

“ ‘Ere this moment came, a 
flight of geese 

Passed low o’erhead, press- 
ing woe; 

The refuge and disconsolate 
owl did pass 

This hid’n place of mine, 
bereft 

Of that which nature freely 
gives but man denies! 

The stars are silent when 
they light our home: 

The trees themselves pro- 
claim the flight of kings.” 



MINDSWAP

“He means,” the ganzer egg 
said, “that he had a feeling you’d 
be coming this way.” 

“Is he crazy or something?” 
Otis asked. “The way he talks — ” 

“Now rede me this! I’ll have 
no plattering roth to creep 
between the interstices of 
a mind 

Proclaiming treason,” the 
hermit said. 

“He doesn’t want you to whis- 
per to each other,” the ganzer 
egg translated. “It makes him 
suspicious.” 

“I could figure that much out 
for myself,” Flynn said. 

“So go whistle,” the ganzer egg 
said. “I was just trying to be 
helpful.” 

The hermit advanced several 
paces, halted, and said: 

“What wot ye here aroon?” 

Marvin looked at the ganzer 
egg, who remained obstinately 
silent. So, guessing at the mean- 
ing of the words, Marvin said, 
“Sir, we are trying to escape from 
this planet, and we have come 
to you for help.” 

The hermit shook his head 
and said, 

“What barbrous tongue is 
this? A thick-mouthed 
sheep 

Would clothe his meaning in 
a sound more clear!” 



“What does he mean?” Mar- 
vin asked. 

“You’re so smart, figure it out 
for yourself,” the ganzer egg said. 

“I’m sorry if I insulted you,” 
Marvin said. 

“Forget it, forget it.” 

“I really am sorry. I’d appre- 
ciate it if you’d translate for us.” 
“All right,” the ganzer egg said, 
still a little sulkily. “He says he 
doesn’t understand you.” 

“He doesn’t? But what I said 
to him was clear enough.” 

“Not to him,” the ganzer egg 
said. “You want to reach him, 
you’d better put it in meter.” 

4CT^/Te? I couldn’t!” Marvin 
said, with that instinctual 
shudder of revulsion which all in- 
telligent Terran males feel at the 
thought of verse. “I simply 
couldn’t! Otis, maybe you — ” 
“Not me!” Otis said, alarmed. 

“A silence swells and grows; 

yet honest men 
Speak bold, with well-formed 
mouth! Melikes it not 
What this development por- 
tends.” 

“He’s getting edgy,” the ganzer 
egg said. “You better have a shot 
at it.” 

“Perhaps you could do it for 
us,” Otis suggested. 

“I’m no fag,” the ganzer egg 
sneered. “If you want to speak, 



48 



GALAXY 



you’ll have to speak for your- 
selves.” 

“The only poem I can remem- 
ber from school is the Rubaiyat,” 
Marvin said. 

“Well, go to it,” the ganzer egg 
said. 

Marvin thought, twitched and 
nervously said: 

“Behold! A pilgrim from the 
forest war 

Of race ’gainst race, does 
humbly implore 

Your aid and sustenance, 
and help and hope. 

Can you this humble earnest 
plea ignore?” 

“Very shaky,” whispered the 
ganzer egg. “But not bad for a 
first attempt.” (Otis was giggling, 
and Marvin clouted him with his 
tail.) 

The hermit replied: 

“Well spoken, stranger! You 
shall have this aid. 

Nay, more! For when men 
meet, despite their divers 
forms, 

They needs must succor each 
one to his own.” 

More quickly now, Marvin re- 
plied : 

“I hoped, in this ancient 
planetoid with dreams dis- 
played 



Of sunrise splendors, sunsets 
disarrayed, 

That one poor pilgrim who 
did pass this way 

Might find escape from ter- 
rors he surveyed.” 

The hermit said: 

“I find thee apt : ’Tis parlous 
to relate 

In these lean times a halting 
tongue may work 

Quick mischief ’pon its sad- 
dened owner-lord.” 

Marvin said: 

“Ah come, take Marvin 
Flynn away, and leave 

The Rest to wrangle! He 
would grieve 

To find his body torn and 
wounded; therefore now 

He’d like to go, whilst others 
stand and cheer.” 

The hermit said: 

“Away then, gentlemen! 
Hearts high, 

Feet firm in stirrups, head 
uplifted be . 

And so they proceeded in sing- 
song fashion to the hermit’s hut, 
where they saw, hidden away un- 
der some sheets of bark, an il- 
legal Mindsender, of an ancient 
and curious design. And Marvin 



MINDSWAP 



49 



learned that there was method 
in even the direst madness. For 
the hermit had been on this 
planet for less than a year, and 
already had made a considerable 
fortune by smuggling refugees to 
the less savory labor markets of 
the galaxy. 

It was not ethical; but as the 
hermit put it? 

“Call you it dastardly, then, 
the tricks I play 
With this my engine? Sobeit! 

Nay, I’ll not dispute 
The arid-abstract trueness of 
your plea. 

Yet think upon’t; this folly 
to refuse bad wine 
When chok’t with desert 
thirst. Not so? Then why 
So harshly judge the salvor 
of your life? 

’Tis damned ingratitude of 
most perversity — 

To slap the hand that 
plucked Death’s grip from 
thee!” 

A small amount of time passed. 

A job for Otis Dagobert had 
not been difficult to find. Despite 
his protestations to the contrary, 
the young man showed a small 
but very promising streak of sad- 
ism. Accordingly, the Hermit 
Swapped him into the mind of a 
dental assistant on Prodenda IX. 

The ganzer egg wished Marvin 
the best of good fortune and 



rolled off into the forest toward 
his home. 

“And now,” the hermit said, 
“we come to the problem of you. 
It seems to me considering your 
personality quite obj ectively, that 
you have a definite aptitude as a 
victim.” 

“Me?” Marvin asked. 

“Yes, you,” the hermit replied. 

“A victim?” 

“Definitely a victim.” 

“I’m not so sure,” Marvin re- 
plied. He stated it that way out 
of politeness; actually, he was 
quite sure that the hermit was 
wrong. 

“Well, I’m sure,” the hermit 
said. “And I daresay I’ve had 
more experience in job placement 
than you.” 

“I suppose you have. I notice 
that you are no longer speaking 
in verse.” 

“Of course not,” the hermit 
said. “Why should I?” 

“Because earlier,” Marvin said, 
“you had been speaking only in 
verse.” 

“But that v/ as entirely differ- 
ent,” the hermit said. “I was out- 
side then. I had to protect my- 
self. Now I am in my house, and 
therefore quite safe.” 

“Does verse really protect you 
outside?” Marvin asked. 

“Well, what do you think? I 
have lived on this planet for over 
a year, hunted by two murderous 
races who would kill me on sight 



50 



GALAXY 



if they could find me. And in that 
time I have suffered no harm 
whatsoever.” 

“Well, it’s very fine, of course. 
But I don’t quite see the relation- 
ship between your language and 
your safety.” 

“I’ll be damned if I see it, 
either,” the hermit said. “I like 
to think of myself as a rational 
man; but the efficacy of verse 
is one thing that I am reluctant- 
ly forced to accept on faith. It 
works; what more can I say?” 

“Have you ever thought of ex- 
perimenting?” Marvin asked. “I 
mean, speaking outside without 
your language of verse? You 
might find you don’t need it.” 

“So I might,” the hermit re- 
plied. “And if you tried walking 
on the ocean bottom, you might 
find that you didn’t need air.” 

“It’s not really the same thing,” 
Marvin said. 

“It’s exactly the same thing,” 
the hermit told him. “But we 
were talking about you and vic- 
timization. I repeat, you have an 
aptitude, which opens the pos- 
sibility of an extremely interest- 
ing position for you.” 

“I am not interested,” Marvin 
said. “What else do you have 
available?” 

“Nothing else,” the hermit 
said. 

By a remarkable coincidence, 
Marvin heard at that moment a 
great crashing and thundering in 



the underbrush outside, and de- 
duced that it was either the Mel- 
dens or the Ganzers, or both, 
coming in pursuit of him. 

“I accept the job,” Marvin 
said. “But you’re wrong.” 

He had the satisfaction of the 
last word; but the Hermit had 
the satisfaction of the last deed. 
For, arranging his equipment and 
adjusting his dials, he closed the 
switch and sent Marvin off to his 
new career on the planet Cel- 
sus V. 

XIV 

/"vn Celsus V the giving and 
receiving of gifts is a cultur- 
al imperative. To refuse a gift is 
unthinkable; the emotion it rais- 
es in a Celsian is comparable to 
the incest-dread of a Terran. 
Normally this causes no trouble. 
Most gifts are white gifts, in- 
tended to express various shades 
of love, gratitude, tenderness, 
etc. But there are also gray gifts 
of warning, and black gifts of 
death. 

Thus, a certain public official 
received a handsome snout ring 
from his constituents. It was im- 
periously designed for two weeks’ 
wear. It was a splendid object, it 
had only one flaw. It ticked. 

A creature of another race 
might have flung it into the near- 
est ditch. But no Celsian in his 
right mind would do that. He 



MINDSWAP 



51 



wouldn’t even have the ring ex- 
amined. Celsians live by the mot- 
to : do not look a gift in the teeth. 
Besides, if word of his suspicion 
leaked out, it would cause an 
irreparable public scandal. 

He had to wear that damned 
ring for two weeks. 

But the thing was ticking. 

The official, whose name was 
Marduk Kras, pondered the 
problem. He thought about his 
constituents, and various ways he 
had helped them, and various 
other ways he had failed them. 
The ring was a warning, that 
much was clear. It was at best 
a warning — a gray gift. At worst, 
it was a black gift — a small bomb 
of popular design, which would 
blow his head off after the elapse 
of several anxiety-ridden days. 

Marduk was not suicidal; he 
knew that he could not wear that 
damned ring. But he also knew 
that he had to wear that damned 
ring. Thus, he found himself fac- 
ing a classic Celsian dilemma. 

“Would they do that to me?” 
Marduk asked himself. “Just be- 
cause I rezoned their dirty old 
residential neighborhood for 
heavy industry, and entered into 
an agreement with the Land- 
lord’s Guild to raise their rents 
320 per cent in return for a prom- 
ise of new plumbing within fifty 
years? I mean to say, Good Lord, 
I’ve never pretended to be per- 
fect." 



The ring ticked merrily away, 
tickling his snout and alarming 
his senses. Marduk thought of 
other officials whose heads had 
been blown off by dim-witted 
hotheads. Yes, it might very pos- 
sibly be a black gift. 

“Those stupid molters!” Mar- 
duk snarled, relieving his feelings 
with an insult he would never 
have dared voice in public. He 
was feeling sorely aggrieved. You 
worked your hearts out for those 
slack-skinned, wart-nosed idiots, 
and what was your reward? A 
bomb to wear in your nose! 

TT'or one hectic moment he con- 
templated throwing the ring 
into the nearest chlorine tank. 
That would show them! And 
there was precedent for it. Had 
not the saintly Voreeg spurned 
the Total Offering of the Three 
Ghosts? 

Yes . But the Ghosts’ Offer- 
ing, according to accepted exeges- 
is, had been a subtle attack upon 
the spirit of Gift-Giving, and 
therefore at the very core of so- 
ciety; for by making a Total Of- 
fering, they had precluded the 
possibility of any future gifts. 

Besides — what was admirable 
for a Saint of the Second King- 
dom would be execrable for a 
petty official of the Tenth Demo- 
cracy. Saints can do anything; 
ordinary men must do what is ex- 
pected of them.

GALAXY 




MINDSWAP 



Marduk’s shoulders slumped. 
He plastered warm mud on his 
feet, but it brought no relief. 
There was no way out. One Celsi- 
an could not stand alone against 
organized society. He would have 
to wear the ring, and wait for 
the mind- splitting moment when 
the tick stopped . 

But wait! There was a way! 

Yes, yes, he could see it now! 
It would take clever arrange- 
ment; but if he brought it off, he 
could have safety and social ap- 
proval. If only that damned ring 
gave him time . 

Marduk Kras made several ur- 
gent calls, and arranged for him- 
self to be ordered to the planet 
Taami II (the Tahiti of the Ten- 
Star Region) on urgent business. 
Not corporeally, of course. No 
responsible official would spend 
local funds to ship his body across 
a hundred light years when all 
that was required was his mind. 
Frugal, trustworthy Marduk 
would travel by Mindswap. He 
would satisfy the form, if not the 
spirit, of Celsian custom by leav- 
ing his body behind with the gift 
ring ticking merrily in its nose. 

He had to find a mind to in- 
habit his body during his absence. 
But that was not difficult. There 
are too many minds in the galaxy, 
and not enough bodies to go 
around. (Why this should be, no 
one really knows. After all, 
everyone was given one of each 



to begin with. But some people 
always seem to end up with more 
than they need, be it wealth, 
power, or bodies; and some with 
less.) 

Marduk got in touch with Her- 
mit Enterprises (Bodies for Any 
Purpose). The hermit had just 
the thing for him; a clean-cut 
young Terr an male in imminent 
danger of losing his life, and will- 
ing to take his chances with a 
ticking nose ring. 

Thus Marvin Flynn came to 
Celsus V. 

TT'or once there was no need to 
hurry. Upon arrival, Marvin 
was able to follow prescribed 
Swapping procedures. He lay per- 
fectly still, growing slowly accus- 
tomed to his new corpus. He 
tested his limbs, checked out his 
senses, and scanned the primary 
culture-configuration-load as ra- 
diated from the forebrain for an- 
alogue and similitude factors. 
Then he sized up the hindbrain 
emotional and structure factor 
for crux, nadir and saddlepoint 
Nearly all of this was automatic. 

He found the Celsian body a 
good fit, with a high aspect of 
jointure and an excellent main 
sequence random dispersion pat- 
tern. There were problems, of 
course; the delta curve was ab- 
surdly elliptic, and the UYPs 
(universal Y points) were falci- 
form rather than trapezoidal. But 



54 



GALAXY 



you had to expect that on a Type 
3B planet; under normal circum- 
stances, it would never cause him 
any trouble. 

Taken all in all, it was a body- 
environment-culture-role cluster 
with which he could empathize 
and identify. 

“Feels pretty good,” Marvin 
summed up for himself. “If only 
that damned nose ring doesn’t 
blow up.” 

He got up and took stock of 
his surroundings. The first thing 
he saw was a note which Marduk 
Kras had left for him, tied to his 
wrist so he wouldn’t overlook it. 

Dear Swapper, 

Welcome to Celsus! I re- 
alize that you may not feel 
very welcome, under the cir- 
cumstances, and I regret it 
nearly as much as you do. 
But I would advise you sin- 
cerely to put all thought of 
sudden demise out of your 
mind, and concentrate in- 
stead on having a pleasant 
vacation. It may console you 
to know that the statistical 
incidence of death by black 
gift is no greater than that of 
being killed in a plutonium 
mine accident, if you hap- 
pened to be a plutonium mi- 
ner. So relax and enjoy 
yourself. 

My apartment and all that 
is in it are yours to enjoy. 



My body also, though I trust 
you will not overstrain it or 
keep it out too late or feed 
it an excess of intoxicating 
beverages. It has a weak left 
wrist, so be careful if you 
should have to lift any 
heavy weights. Good luck, 
and try not to worry, since 
anxiety never yet solved a 
problem. 

P.S. I know you are a gentle- 
man and would not try to 
remove the nose ring. But I 
thought I should tell you 
that you can’t anyhow be- 
cause it is locked in place 
with a microscopic Jayverg 
Bonded Molecular Padlock. 
Good-by again, and do try 
to put all this unpleasantness 
out of mind and enjoy your 
two weeks on our lovely 
planet. 

Your Sincere Friend, 
Marduk Kras 

A t first Marvin was irritated by 
the note. But then he laugh- 
ed and crumpled it up. Marduk 
was undoubtedly a scoundrel, but 
he was a likeable one, and not 
ungenerous. Marvin decided to 
make the best of his dubious bar- 
gain, forget about the putative 
bomb nestling just above his lip, 
and enjoy his time on Celsus. 

He went on an exploration of 
his new home, and was well satis- 
fied with what he found. It was 



MINDSWAP 



55 



a bachelor burrow, designed for 
residence rather than for repro- 
duction. Its main construction 
feature — pentabrachiation — re- 
flected Kras’s status as a public 
official. Less fortunate sorts had 
to get by with three or four gal- 
lery systems; and in the slums 
of North Bogger, whole families 
were crowded into wretched mono 
and duobrachiate systems. Hous- 
ing reform had been promised in 
the near future, however. 

The kitchen was neat and 
modern, and well stocked with 
gourmet items. There were jars 
of candied annelids, and a bowl 
of exotic Alcyonium Salad mix- 
ture, and delicious tidbits of Tu- 
bipora, Pennatula, Gorgonia and 
Renilla. There was a can of Goose 
Barnacle in rotifer and orchid 
sauce, and a quick-frozen pack- 
age of sweet and sour Uce. But — 
how like a bachelor — there 
were no staples, not even a gas- 
tropod loaf or a bottle of carbo- 
nated Ginger Honey. 

Wandering down the long, 
curving galleries, Marvin found 
the music room. Marduk had not 
stinted here. A gigantic Imperial 
amplifier dominated the room, 
flanked by two Tyrant-model 
speakers. Marduk used a Whirl- 
pool semi-mix microphone, with 
a forty bbc. channel rejection, an 
“expanding” type sense- discrim- 
ination selector, with a floating 
throat-slot “passive” director. 



Pickup was by image regenera- 
tion, but there was provision for 
changing over to decay modula- 
tion. Although not professional in 
quality, it was a very good ama- 
teur rig. 

The heart of the system, of 
course, was the Insectarium. This 
particular one was an Ingenuator, 
the Super-Max model, with both 
automatic and manual selection 
and mixture controls, regulated 
feed and disposal, and various 
maximizing and minimizing fea- 
tures. 

Marvin selected a grasshopper 
gavotte (Korestal, 43 IB) and 
listened to the thrilling tracheal 
obligatto and the subtle brass ac- 
companiment of the paired Mal- 
phigian tubules. Although Mar- 
vin’s appreciation was casual, he 
was well aware of the virtuoso 
ability of this particular perform- 
er: a Blue-Striped Grasshopper, 
his second thoracic segment pul- 
sating slightly, visible in his own 
compartment of the Insectarium. 

T eaning down, Marvin nodded 

' in appreciation. The Blue- 
Striped Grasshopper clicked 
mandibles, then turned back to 
his music. (He had been bred 
especially for treble and bril- 
liance; a flashy performer, more 
showy than sound. But Marvin 
did not know this.) 

Marvin turned off the selec- 
tion, flipped the status switch 



54 



GALAXY 



from Active to Dormant mode; 
the grasshopper went back to 
sleep. The Insectarium was well 
stocked, especially with Mayfly 
symphonies and the strange new 
cutworm songs, but Marvin had 
too much to explore to bother 
with music just now. 

In the living room, Marvin 
lowered himself into a stately old 
clay bank (a genuine Wormstet- 
ter), rested his head against the 
wellworn granite headrest, and 
tried to relax. But the ring in his 
snout ticked away, a continual 
intrusion to his sense of well-be- 
ing. He reached down and picked 
at random a quick-stick from a 
pile on a low table. He ran his 
antennae over the grooves, but it 
was no use. He couldn’t concen- 
trate on light fiction. Impatiently 
he threw tire quick-stick aside 
and tried to make some plans. 

But he was in the grip of an 
implacable dynamism. He had to 
assume that the moments of his 
life were severely limited, and 
those moments were passing 
away. He wanted to do something 
to commemorate his final hours. 
But what was there he could do? 

He slid out of the Wormstetter 
and paced the main gallery, his 
claws clicking irritably. Then, 
coming to an abrupt decision, he 
went to the wardrobe room. Here 
he selected a new casing of gold- 
bronze chitin, and arranged it 
carefully over his shoulders. He 



plastered his facial bristles witti 
perfumed glue, and arranged 
them en brosse over his cheeks. 
He applied a mild stiffener to his 
antennae, pointed them at a jaun- 
ty sixty degrees, and allowed 
them to droop in their attractive 
natural curve. Lastly, he dusted 
his mid-section with Lavender 
Sand, and outlined his shoulder 
joints with lampblack. 

Surveying himself in the mir- 
ror, he decided that the effect 
was not unpleasing. He was well- 
dressed, but not dandified. Judg- 
ing as objectively as he could, he 
decided that he was a pre- 
sentable, rather scholarly looking 
young fellow. Not a Squig Star 
by any means, but definitely not 
a drunfiler. 

He left his burrow by the main 
entrance, and replaced the en- 
trance plug. 

It was dusk. Stars glittered 
overhead; they seemed no more 
numerous than the myriad lights 
in the entrances of the countless 
burrows, both commercial and 
private, which made up the pul- 
sating heart of the city. The sight 
thrilled Marvin. Surely, surely, 
somewhere in the endless inter- 
twining corridors of the great city, 
there would be that for him which 
would bring pleasure. Or, at 
least, a soft and forgetful sur- 
cease. 

Thus, Marvin walked dolorous- 
ly, yet with a tremulous hopeful- 



MINDSWAP 



57 



ness, toward the hectic and beck- 
oning Main Groove of the City, 
there to find what chance held 
out for him or fate decreed. 

XV 

X T 7"ith a long rolling stride and 
* * a creaking of leather boots, 
Marvin Flynn strode down the 
wooden sidewalk. Faintly there 
came to him the mingled odors 
of sagebrush and chapparal. On 
either side of him the adobe walls 
of the town glittered under the 
moon like dull Mexican silver. 
From a nearby saloon there came 
the strident tones of a banjo — 

Frowning deeply, Marvin stop- 
ped in midstride. Sagebrush? Sa- 
loons? What was going on 
around here? 

“Something wrong, stranger?” 
a harsh voice intoned. 

Flynn whirled. A figure step- 
ped out of the shadows near the 
General Store. It was a saddle- 
bum, a sniffling, slump-shoulder- 
ed loafer with a dusty black hat 
crushed comically on his begrim- 
ed forehead. 

“Yes, something is very 
wrong,” Marvin said. “Every- 
thing seems — strange.” 

“ ‘Tain’t nothing to be alarmed 
about,” the saddlebum reassured 
him. “You have merely changed 
your system of metaphoric refer- 
ence, and the lord knows there’s 
no crime in that. As a matter of 



fact, you should be happy to g: ye 
up those dreary animal-insect 
comparisons.” 

“There was nothing wrong with 
my comparisons,” Marvin said. 
“After all, I am on Celsus V, 
and I do live in a burrow.” 

“So what?” the saddlebum said. 
“Haven’t you any imagination?” 
“I’ve got plenty of imagina- 
tion!” Marvin said indignantly. 
“But that’s hardly the point. I 
simply mean that it is inconsis- 
tent to think like a cowboy on 
Earth when one is actually a sort 
of mole-like creature on Celsus.” 
“It can’t be helped,” the sad- 
dlebum said. “What’s happened 
is, you’ve overloaded your an- 
alogizing faculty, thereby blow- 
ing a fuse. Accordingly, your per- 
ceptions have taken up the task 
of experimental normalization. 
This state is known as metaphoric 
deformation.” 

\ Tow Marvin remembered the 
' warning he had received 
from Mr. Blanders concerning 
this phenomenon. Metaphoric de- 
formation. that disease of the in- 
terstellar traveler, had struck 
him suddenly and without warn- 
ing. 

He knew that he should be 
alarmed but instead felt only a 
mild surprise. His emotions were 
consistent with his perceptions, 
since a change unperceived is a 
change unfelt.

“When,” Marvin asked, “will I 
start to see things as they really 
are?” 

“That last is a question for a 
philosopher,” the saddlebum told 
him. “But speaking in a limited 
fashion, this particular syndrome 
will pass if you ever get back to 
Earth. But if you continue trav- 
elling the process of perceptual 
analogizing will increase; though 
occasional short-lived remissions 
into your primary situation-per- 
ception-context may be expect- 
ed.” 

Marvin found that interesting, 
but unalarming. He hitched up 
his jeans and said, “Waal, reckon 
a man’s gotta play out the hand 
that’s dealt to him and I ain’t 
about to stand here all night jaw- 
ing about it. Just who are you, 
stranger?” 

“I,” said the saddlebum, with 
a certain smugness, “am he with- 
out whom your dialogue would 
be impossible. I am Necessity 
personified; without me, you 
would have had to remember the 
Theory of Metaphoric Deforma- 
tion all by yourself, and I doubt 
that you are capable of it. You 
may cross my palm with silver.” 

“That’s for gypsies,” Marvin 
said scornfully. 

“Sorry,” the saddlebum said, 
without the least show of embar- 
rassment. “Got a tailor-made?” 

“Got the makings,” Marvin 
said, flipping him a sack of Bull 



Durham. He contemplated his 
new companion for a moment, 
then said, “Waal, yore a mangy 
looking critter, and it seems to 
me more half jackass and half 
prairie dog. But I reckon I’m 
stuck with you no matter who 
you are.” 

“Bravo,” the saddlebum said 
gravely. “You conquer change of 
context with that same sureness 
with which an ape conquers a 
banana.” 

“Reckon that’s a tetch high- 
falutin,” Marvin said equably. 
‘What’s the next move, perfes- 
ser?” 

‘We shall proceed,” the sad- 
dlebum said, “To yonder saloon 
of evil repute.” 

“Yippee,” Marvin said, and 
strode leanhipped through the 
batwinged saloon doors. 

Within the saloon, a female at- 
tached herself to Marvin’s arm. 
She looked up at him with a 
smile of Vermillion bas-relief. 
Her unfocused eyes were pencill- 
ed in imitation of gaiety; her 
flaccid face was painted with the 
lying hieroglyphics of animation. 

“Co’mon upstairs with me, 
kid,” grisly beldame cried “Lotsa 
fun, lotsa laughs!” 

“It is droll to realize,” the 
saddlebum said, “that Custom 
has decreed this lady’s mask, pro- 
claiming that those who sell 
pleasure must portray enjoy- 
ment. It is a hard demand, my

friends, and not imposed upon 
any other occupation. For note: 
the fish wife is allowed to hate 
herring, the vegetable man may 
be allergic to turnips, and even 
the newspaper boy is permitted 
his illiteracy. Not even the bless- 
ed saints are required to enjoy 
their holy martyrdoms. Only the 
humble sellers of pleasure are re- 
quired, like Tantalus, to be for- 
ever expectant of an untouchable 
feast.” 

“Yer friend’s a great little bid- 
der, ain’t he?” the termagent said. 
“But I like you best, baby, ’cause 
you make me go all mush in- 
side.” 

TYrom the virago’s neck there 
4 hung a pendant upon which 
was strung in miniature a skull, 
a piano, an arrow, a baby’s shoe, 
and a yellowed tooth. 

“What are those?” Marvin 
asked 

“Symbols,” she said. 

“Of what?” 

“Come on upstairs and I’ll 
show you, sweety.” 

“And thus,” the saddlebum in- 
toned, “we perceive the true un- 
mediated confrontation of the 
aroused feminine nature, ’gainst 
which our masculine fancies 
seem mere baby’s toys.” 

“C’mon!” the harpy cried, 
wriggling her gross body in a 
counterfeit of passion all the 
more frightening because it was 



real. “Upstairs to bed!” she 
shouted, pressing against Marvin 
with a breast the size and con- 
sistency of an empty Mongolian 
saddlebag. “I’ll really show ya 
somepin!” she cried, entwining 
his thews with a heavy white leg, 
grimy and heavily varicosed. 
“When ya git loved by me,” she 
howled, “you’ll damned well 
know you been loved!” And she 
ground lasciviously against him 
with her pudenda, which was as 
heavily armored as the forehead 
of a Tyrannosaurus. 

“Well’er, thank you so terribly 
much anyhow,” Marvin said, “but 
I don’t think just at the moment 
I — ” 

“You don’t want no lovin?” the 
woman asked incredulously. 

“Well, actually, I can’t really 
say that I do.” 

The woman planted knobkerry 
fists on tom-tom hips and said, 
“That I should live to see this 
day!” But then she softened, and 
said, “Turn not away from Ve- 
nus’s sweet perfumed home of 
pleasure! Thou must strive, sir, 
to overcome this most unseemly 
gesture of unmanliness. Come, 
my lord! The bugle sounds! 
Mount and fiercely press thy 
charge!” 

“Oh, I rather think not,” Mar- 
vin said, laughing hollowly. 

She seized him by the throat 
with a hand the size and shape of 
a Chilean poncho. “You’ll do it

now, you lousy cowardly inward- 
directed goddam narcissist bas- 
tard, and you’ll do it good and 
proper, or by Ares I’ll snap your 
scrawny windpipe like a Mich- 
aelmas chicken!” 

A tragedy seemed in the mak- 
ing, for the woman’s passion ren- 
dered her incapable of a judi- 
cious modification of her de- 
mands. 

Luckily the saddlebum, fol- 
lowing the dictates of his wit if 
not his predilection, snatched a 
fan out of his gun belt, leaned 
forward simpering, and tapped 
the enraged woman on her rhino- 
cerine upper arm. 

“Don’t you dare hurt him!” 
the saddlebum said, his voice a 
squeaky contralto. 

Marvin, quick if not apt, re- 
joindered, “Yes, tell her to stop 
pawing me! I mean to say it is 
simply too much, one cannot 
even stroll out of one’s house in 
the evening without encountering 
some disgraceful incident — ” 

“Don’t cry, for God’s sake, 
don’t cry!” the saddlebum said. 
“You know I can’t stand it when 
you cry!” 

“I am not crying!” Marvin 
said, snuffling. “It is just that 
she has ruined this shirt. Your 
present!” 

“I’ll get you another!” the sad- 
dlebum said. “But I cannot abide 
another scene!” 

The woman was staring at 



them slack-jawed, and Marvin 
was able to utilize her moment 
of inattention by taking a pry 
bar out of his tool kit, setting 
it under her swollen red fingers, 
and prying himself free of her 
grip. Seizing the dwindling mo- 
ment of opportunity, Marvin and 
the saddlebum sprinted out the 
door, leaped around the corner, 
broad-jumped across the street, 
and pole-vaulted to freedom. 

/'^nce clear of the immediate 
danger, Marvin came ab- 
ruptly to his senses. The scales 
of metaphoric deformation fell 
away for the moment, and he ex- 
perienced a perceptual experien- 
tial remission. It was all too pain- 
fully apparent now that the ‘sad- 
dlebum’ was actually a large pa- 
rasite beetle of the species S. 
Cthulu. There would be no mis- 
take about this, since the Cthulu 
beetle is characterized by a sec- 
ondary salivary duct located just 
below and slightly to the left of 
the subesophegal ganglion. 

These beetles feed upon bor- 
rowed emotions, their own having 
long ago atrophied. Typically, 
they lurk in dark and shadowy 
places, waiting for a careless Cel- 
sian to pass within range of their 
segmented maxilla. That is what 
happened to Marvin. 

Realizing this, Marvin directed 
at the beetle an emotion of anger 
so powerful that the Cthulu, vic- 



MINDSWAP 



61 



tim of its own hyperacute emo- 
tional receptors, fell over uncon- 
scious in the road. That done, 
Marvin readjusted his gold- 
bronze casing, stiffened his an- 
tennae, and continued down the 
road. 

XVI 

TT e came to a bridge that cross- 
“ed a great flowing river of 
sand. Standing on the center 
span, he gazed downward into 
the black depths which rolled in- 
exorably onward to the myster- 
ious sand sea. Half -hypnotized 
he gazed, the nose ring beating 
its quick tattoo of mortality three 
times faster than the beat of his 
hearts. And he thought: 

Bridges are receptacles of op- 
posed ideas. Their horizontal dis- 
tance speaks to us of our trans- 
cendence; their vertical declivity 
reminds us unalterably of the im- 
minence of failure, the sureness 
of death. We push outward across 
obstacles, but the primordial fall 
is forever beneath our feet. We 
build, construct, fabricate; but 
death is the supreme architect, 
who shapes heights only that 
there may be depths. 

O Celsians, throw your well- 
wrought bridges across a thou- 
sand rivers, and tie together the 
disparate contours of the planet. 
Your mastery is for naught, for 
the land is still beneath you, still 



waiting, still patient. Celslana, 
you have a road to follow, but 
it leads assuredly to death. Cel- 
sians, despite your cunning, you 
have one lesson still to learn. The 
heart is fashioned to receive the 
spear. All other effects are ex- 
traneous. 

These were Marvin’s thoughts 
as he stood on the bridge. And a 
great longing overcame him, a 
desire to be finished with desire, 
to forego pleasure and pain, to 
quit the petty modes of achieve- 
ment and failure, to have done 
with distractions, and get on with 
the business of life, which was 
death. 

Slowly he climbed to the rail, 
and there stood poised over the 
twisting currents of sand. Then, 
out of the corner of his eye, he 
saw a shadow detach itself from 
a pillar, move tentatively to the 
rail, stand erect, poise itself over 
the abyss and lean precariously 
outward — 

“Stop! Wait!” Marvin cried. 
His own desire for destruction 
had been abruptly terminated. 
He saw only a fellow-creature in 
peril. 

The shadowy figure gasped, 
and abruptly lunged toward the 
yawning river below. Marvin 
moved simultaneously, and man- 
aged to catch an ankle. 

The ensuing wrench almost 
pulled him over the rail. But re- 
covering quickly, Marvin attach-

ed suckers to the porous stone 
sidewalk, spread his lower limbs 
for maximum purchase, wrapped 
two upper limbs around a light 
pole, and maintained a tenacious 
grip with his remaining two arms. 

There was a moment of charg- 
ed equilibrium; then Marvin’s 
strength prevailed over the 
weight of the would-be suicide. 
Slowly, carefully, Marvin pulled, 
shifting his grip from tarsus to 
tibia, hauling without respite un- 
til he had brought that person 
to a point of safety on the road- 
bed of the bridge. 

All recollection of his own self- 
destructive desires had left him. 
He strode forward and grasped 
the suicider by the shoulders, 
shaking fiercely. 

“You damned fool!” Marvin 
shouted. “What kind of a cow- 
ard are you? Only an idiot or a 
madman takes an out like that. 
Haven’t you any guts at all, you 
damned — ” 

He stopped in mid-expletive. 
The would-be suicide was facing 
him, trembling, eyes averted. And 
now Marvin perceived, for the 
first time, that he had rescued 
a woman. 

XVII 

L ater, in a private booth in a 
bridgeside restaurant, Mar- 
vin apologized for his harsh 
words, which had been torn from 



him by shock rather than con- 
viction. But the woman, grace- 
fully clicking her claw, refused 
to accept his apology. 

“Because you are right,” she 
said. “My attempt was the act of 
an idiot or a madwoman, or both. 
Your analysis was correct, I fear. 
You should have let me jump.” 

Marvin perceived how fair she 
was. A small woman, coming 
barely to his upper thorax, she 
was exquisitely made. Her mid- 
body had the true sweet cylinder 
curves, and her proud head sat 
slightly forward of her body at a 
heart-wrenching five degrees 
from the vertical. Her features 
were perfection from the nicely 
bulged forehead to the angular 
sweep of jaw. Her twin oviposi- 
tors were modestly hidden be- 
hind a white satin sash, cut in 
princess style and revealing just 
a tantalizing suggestion of the 
shining green flesh beneath them. 
Her legs, all of them, were clad 
in orange windings, draped to re- 
veal the lissome segmentation of 
the joints. 

A would-be suicide she may 
have been; but she was also the 
most stunning beauty that Mar- 
vin had seen on Celsus. 

His throat went dry at the 
sight of her, and his pulse began 
to race. He found that he was 
staring at the white satin that 
concealed and revealed her high- 
tilted ovipositors. He turned 



MINDSWAP 



63 



away, and found that he was 
looking at the sensual marvel of 
a long, segmented limb. Blushing 
furiously, he forced himself to 
look at the puckered beauty- 
scar on her forehead. 

She seemed unconscious of his 
fervent attention. Unselfconsci- 
ously she said, “Perhaps we 
should introduce ourselves — un- 
der the circumstances!” 

They both laughed immoder- 
ately at her witticism. “My name 
is Marvin Flynn,” Marvin said. 

“Mine is Phthistia Held,” the 
young woman said. 

“I’ll call you Cathy, if you 
don’t mind,” Marvin said. 

Hphey both laughed again : Then 
Cathy grew serious. Taking 
note of the too-quick passage of 
time, she said, “I must thank you 
again. And now I must leave.” 
“Of course,” Marvin said, ris- 
ing. “When may I see you 
again?” 

“Never,” she said in a low 
voice. 

“But I must!” Marvin said. “I 
mean to say, now that I’ve found 
you I can never let you go.” 
She shook her head sadly. 
“Once in a while,” she murmur- 
ed, “will you give one little 
thought to me?” 

“We must not say good-by!” 
Marvin said. 

“Oh, you’ll get by,” she re- 
plied, not cruelly. 

64 



“I’ll never smile again,” Mar- 
vin told her. 

“Somebody else will be taking 
my place,” she predicted. 

“You are temptation!” he 
shouted in a fury. 

“We are like two ships that 
pass in the night,” she corrected. 

“Will we never meet again?” 
Marvin queried. 

“Time alone can tell.” 

“My prayer is to be there with 
you,” Marvin said hopefully. 

“East of the Sun and West 
of the Moon,” she intoned. 

“You’re mean to me,” Mar- 
vin pouted. 

“I didn’t know what time it 
was,” she said. “But I know what 
time it is now!” And so saying, 
she whirled and darted out the 
door. 

Marvin watched her leave, 
then sat down at the bar. “One 
for my baby, and one for 
the road,” he told the bartender. 

“A woman’s a two-face,” the 
bartender commented sympa- 
thetically, pouring a drink. 

“I got the mad-about-her-sad- 
without-her blues,” Marvin re- 
plied. 

“A fellow needs a girl,” the 
bartender told him. 

Marvin finished his drink and 
held out his glass. “A pink cock- 
tail for a blue lady,” he ordered, 

“She may be weary,” the bar- 
tender suggested. 

“I don’t know why I love her 

GALAXY 



like I do,” Marvin stated. “But 
at least I do know why there’s no 
sun up in the sky. In my solitude 
she haunts me like a tinkling 
piano in the next apartment. But 
I’ll be around no matter how she 
treats me now. Maybe it was just 
one of those things; yet I’ll re- 
member April and her, and the 
evening breeze caressed the trees 
but not for me, and — ” 

'’Inhere is no telling how long 
Marvin might have continu- 
ed his lament had not a voice 
at the level of his ribs and two 
feet to his left whispered, “Hey, 
Meester.” 

Marvin turned and saw a small, 
plump, raggedly dressed Celsian 
sitting on the next bar stool. 

“What is it?” Marvin asked 
brusquely. 

“You maybe want see thees 
muchacha so beautiful other 
time?” 

“Yes, I do. But what can you 

» 

“I am private investigator tra- 
cer of lost persons satisfaction 
guaranteed or not one cent in tri- 
bute.” 

“What kind of an accent have 
you got?” Marvin asked. 

“Lambrobian,” the investigator 
said. “My name is Juan Valdez 
and I come from the fiesta lands 
below the border to make my 
fortune here in big city of the 
Norte.” 



“Sandback,” the bartender 
snarled. 

“What thees theeng you call 
me?” the little Lombrobian said, 
with suspicious mildness. 

“I called you a sandback, you 
lousy little sandback,” the bar- 
tender snarled. 

“That ees what I thought,” 
said Valdez. He reached into his 
cummerbund, took out a long, 
double-edged knife and drove it 
into the bartender’s heart, killing 
him instantly. 

“I am a mild man, senor,” he 
said to Marvin. “I am not a man 
quickly to take offense. Indeed, 
in my home village of Montana 
Verde de los tres Picos, I am 
considered a harmless man. I ask 
nothing more than to be allowed 
to cultivate my peyote buds in 
the high mountains of Lombro- 
bia under the shade of that tree 
which we call ‘the sun hat,’ for 
these are the bes’ peyote buds 
in all the world.” 

“I can understand that.” 

“Yet still,” Valdez said, more 
sternly, “when an exploitator del 
norte insults me, and by impli- 
cation, defames those who gave 
me birth and nurtured me — why 
then, senor, a blinding red mist 
descends over my field of vision 
and my knife springs to my hand 
unaided, and proceeds from there 
non-stop to the heart of the be- 
trayer of the children of the 
poor.”

“It could happen to anyone,” 
Marvin said, 

“And yet,” Valdez said, “des- 
pite my keen sense of honor, I 
am essentially childlike, intuitive 
and easy-going.” 

“I had noticed that, as a mat- 
ter of fact,” Marvin said. 

“But enough of that. Now, you 
wish hire me investigation find 
girl? But of course. El buen pano 
en el area se vende, verdad?” 

“Si, hombre,” Marvin replied, 
laughing. “Y el deseo vence al 
miedo!” 

“Pues, adelante!” And arm in 
arm the two comrades marched 
out into the night of a thousand 
brilliant stars like the lance- 
points of a mighty host. 

XVIII 

/^vnce outside the restaurant, 
Valdez turned his mus- 
tached brown face to the heavens 
and located the constellation In- 
vidius, which, in northern lati- 
tudes, points unerringly to the 
north-northeast. With this as a 
base line, he established cross 
references, using the wind on his 
cheek (blowing west at five miles 
per hour), and the moss on the 
trees (growing on the' northerly 
sides of decidupis trunks at one 
millimeter per diem). He allow- 
ed for a westerly error of one foot 
per mile (drift), and a southerly 
error of five inches per hundred 



yards (combined tropism ef- 
fects). Then, with all factors ac- 
counted for, he began walking in 
a south-southwesterly direction. 

Marvin followed. Within an 
hour they had left the city, and 
were proceeding through a stub- 
bled farming district. Another 
hour put them beyond the last 
signs of civilization, in a wilder- 
ness of tumbled granite and 
greasy feldspar. 

Valdez showed no signs of 
stopping, and Marvin began to 
feel vague stirrings of doubt. 

“Just where, exactly, are we 
going?” he asked at last. 

“To find your Cathy,” Valdez 
replied, his teeth flashing white 
in his good-humored burnt sienna 
face. 

“Does she really live this far 
from the city?” 

“I have no idea where she 
lives,” Valdez replied, shrugging. 

“You don’t?” 

“No, I don’t.” 

Marvin stopped abruptly. “But 
you said that you did know!” 

“I never said or implied that,” 
Valdez said, his umber forehead 
wrinkling. “I said that I would 
help you find her.” 

“But if you don’t know where 
she lives — ” 

“It is quite unimportant,” Val- 
dez said, holding up a stern 
musteline forefinger. “Our quest 
has nothing to do with finding 
where Cathy lives; our quest, 



66 



GALAXY 



pure and simple, is to find Cathy, 
That, at least, was my under- 
standing.” 

“Yes, of course,” Marvin said. 
“But if we’re not going to where 
she lives, then where are we go- 
ing?” 

“To where she weel be,” Val- 
dez replied serenely. 

“Oh,” Marvin said. 

ry'hey walked on through tower- 
-®- ing mineral marvels, coming 
at last into scrubby foothills that 
lay like tired walruses around the 
gleaming blue whale of a lofty 
mountain range. Another hour 
passed, and Marvin again grew 
disquieted. But this time he ex- 
pressed his anxiety in a round- 
about fashion, hoping by guile to 
gain insight. 

“Have you known Cathy 
long?” he asked. 

“I have never had the good 
fortune to meet her,” Valdez re- 
plied. 

“Then you saw her for the 
first time in the restaurant with 
me?” 

“Unfortunately I did not even 
see her there, since I was in the 
men’s room passing a kidney 
stone during the time of your 
conversation with her. I may 
have caught a glimpse of her as 
she turned from you and depart- 
ed; but more likely I saw only 
the doppler effect produced by 
the swinging red door.”

“Then you know nothing what- 
soever about Cathy?” 

“Only the little I have heard 
from you; which, frankly, 
amounts to practically nothing.” 
“Then how,” Marvin asked, 
“can you possibly take me to 
where she will be?” 

“It is simple enough,” Valdez 
said. “A moment’s reflection 
should clear the matter for you.” 
Marvin reflected for several 
moments, but the matter stayed 
refractory. 

“Consider it logically,” Valdez 
said. “What is my problem? To 
find Cathy. What do I know 
about Cathy? Nothing.” 

“That doesn’t sound so good.” 
“But it is only half the prob- 
lem. Granted that I know noth- 
ing about Cathy; what do I know 
about Finding?” 

“What?” Marvin asked. 

“It happens that I know every- 
thing about Finding,” Valdez 
said triumphantly, gesturing with 
his graceful terra cotta hands. 
“For I am an expert in the The- 
ory of Searches!” 

“The what?” Marvin asked. 
“The Theory of Searches!” 
Valdez said, a little less trium- 
phantly. 

“I see,” Marvin said, unim- 
pressed. “Well, that’s great. I’m 
sure it’s a very good theory. But 
if you don’t know anything about 
Cathy, I don’t see how any 
theory will help.” 

68 



Valdez sighed, not unpleasant- 
ly, and touched his mustache 
with a puce-colored hand. “My 
friend, if you knew all about 
Cathy — her habits, friends, de- 
sires, dislikes, hopes, fears, 
dreams, intentions, and the like — 
do you think you would be able 
to find her?” 

“I’m sure I could,” Marvin 
said. 

“Even without knowing the 
Theory of Searches?” 

“Yes.” 

“Well then,” Valdez said, “ap- 
ply that same reasoning to the 
reverse condition. I know all 
there is to know about the The- 
ory of Searches. Therefore I 
need to know nothing about 
Cathy.” 

nphey marched steadily up- 
ward, across the steepening 
face of a mountain slope. A bit- 
ter wind screamed and buffeted 
at them, and patches of hoarfrost 
began to appear underfoot on 
the path. 

Valdez talked about his re- 
searches into the Theory of 
Searches, citing the following

“From these specifics,” Valdez 
said, “we derive the general no- 
tion of Search, and its most im- 
portant corollaries.” 

Marvin was too miserable to 
answer. It had suddenly occurred 
to him that one could die in this 
chill and waterless wasteland. 

“Amusingly enough,” Valdez 
said, “the Theory of Searches 
forces upon us the immediate 
conclusion that nothing can be 
truly (or ideally) lost. Consider: 
for a thing to be lost, it would 
require a place to be lost in. But 
no such place can be found, since 
simple multiplicity carries no im- 
plications of qualitative differen- 
tiation. In Search terms, every 
place is like every other place. 
Therefore, we replace the con- 
cept Lost, with the concept of 
indeterminate placement; which, 
of course, is susceptible to logico- 
mathematical analysis.” 

“But if Cathy isn’t really 
lost,” Marvin said, “then we 
can’t really find her.” 

“That statement is true, as far 
as it goes,” Valdez said. “But of 
course, it is merely Ideal notion, 
and of little value in this in- 
stance. For operational purposes 
we must modify the Theory of 
Searches. In fact, we must re- 
MINDSWAP 



verse die major premise of the 
theory and re-accept the original 
concepts of Lost and Found.” 

“It sounds very complicated.” 

“Well, it’s simple enough, once 
you understand the theory,” Val- 
dez said. “Now, to ensure our 
success, we must decide upon the 
optimum form of Search. Obvi- 
ously, if both of you are actively 
questing, your chances of finding 
each other are considerably less- 
ened. Consider two people seek- 
ing one another up and down the 
endless crowded aisles of a great 
department store; and contrast 
that with the improved strategy 
of one seeking, and the other 
standing at a fixed position and 
waiting to be found. The mathe- 
matics are a little intricate, so 
you will just have to take my 
word for it. The best chance of 
you/her finding her/you will be 
for one to search, and the other 
to allow himself/herself to be 
searched for. Our deepest folk 
wisdom has always known this, of 
course.” 

“So what do we do?” 

6 tY have just told you!” Valdez 

JL cried. “One must search, the 
other must wait. Since we have 
no control over Cathy’s actions, 
we assume that she is following 
her instincts and looking for you. 
Therefore you must fight down 
your instincts and wait, thereby 
allowing her to find you.” 

69 



“All I do is wait?” Marvin 
asked. 

“That’s right.” 

“And you really think she’ll 
find me?” 

“I would stake my life on it.” 
“Well . All right. But in that 
case, where are we going now?” 
“To a place where you will 
wait. Technically, it is called a 
Location-Point.” 

Marvin looked confused, so 
Valdez explained further. “Ma- 
thematically, all places are of 
equal potentiality insofar as the 
chances of her finding you are 
concerned. Therefore we are able 
to choose an arbitrary Location- 
Point.” 

“What Location-Point have 
you chosen,” Marvin asked. 

“Since it made no real differ- 
ence,” Flynn said, “I selected the 
village of Montana Verde de los 
tres Picos, in Adelante Province, 
in the country of Lombrobia.” 
“That’s your home town, isn’t 
it?” Marvin asked. 

“As a matter of fact, it is,” 
Valdez said, mildly surprised and 
amused. “That, I suppose, is why 
it came so quickly to my mind.” 
“Isn’t Lombrobia a long way 
off?” 

“A considerable distance,” Val- 
dez admitted. “But our time will 
not be wasted, since I will teach 
you logic, and also the folksongs 
of my country.” 

“It isn’t fair.” 



“My friend,” Valdez told him, 
“when you accept help, you must 
be prepared to take what one is 
capable of giving, not what you 
would like to receive. I have 
never denied my human limita- 
tions; but it is ungrateful of you 
to refer to them.” 

Marvin had to be content with 
that, since he didn’t think he 
could find his way back to the 
city unaided. So they marched 
on through the mountains, and 
they sang many folksongs. 

XIX 

/^vnward they marched-, up the 
polished mirror face of a 
vast mountain. The wind whis- 
tled and screamed, tore at their 
clothing and tugged at their 
straining fingers. Treacherous 
honeycomb ice crumbled under 
their feet as they struggled for 
footholds, their buffeted bodies 
plastered to the icy mountain 
wall and moving leech-like up its 
dazzling surface. 

Valdez bore up through it all 
with a saint-like equanimity. 
“Eet ees deefecult,” he grinned. 
“And yet — for the love which you 
bear for thees woman — eet ees 
all worthwhile, si?” 

“Yeah, sure,” Marvin mum- 
bled. “I guess it is.” But in truth, 
he was beginning to doubt it. Af- 
ter all, he had only known Cathy 
for less than an hour. 



70 



GALAXY 



An avalanche thundered past 
them, and tons of white death 
screamed past — inches from their 
strained and clinging bodies. Val- 
dez smiled with serenity. 

“Beyond all obstacles,” Valdez 
intoned, “lies that summit of ac- 
complishment which is the face 
and form of the beloved.” 
“Yeah, sure,” Marvin said. 
Spears of ice, shaken loose from 
a high dokalma, whirled and 
flashed around them. Marvin 
thought about Cathy, and found 
that he was unable to remember 
what she looked like. It struck 
him that love at first sight was 
overrated. 

A high precipice loomed before 
them. Marvin looked at it, and 
at the shimmering ice fields be- 
yond, and came to the conclusion 
that the game was really not 
worth the candle. 

“I think,” Marvin said, “that 
we should turn back.” 

Valdez smiled subtly, pausing 
on the very edge of the vertigi- 
nous descent into that wintry hell 
of suicidally shaped snow slides. 

“My frien’,” he said, “I know 
why you say this.” 

“You do?” Marvin asked. 

“Of course. It is obvious that 
you do not wish me to risk nay 
life on the continuance of your 
insensate and magnificent quest. 
And it is equally obvious that you 
intend to plunge on alone.” 

“It is?” Marvin asked. 



“Certainly. It would be ap- 
parent to the most casual observ- 
er that you are driven to seek 
your love through any and all 
dangers, by virtue of the unyield- 
ing nature of your personality. 
And it is equally clear that your 
generous and high-spirited men- 
tality would be disturbed at the 
idea of involving one whom you 
consider a close friend and bosom 
companion in so perilous a ven- 
ture.” 

“Well,” Marvin began, “I’m 
not sure — ” 

“But I am sure,” Valdez said 
quietly. “And I reply to your un- 
spoken question as follows: 
“Friendship bears this similarity 
to love : it transcends all limits.’ ” 

<t lA7' e11 ’ that’s very nice of 
* ' you,” Marvin said, eyeing 
the precipice ahead. “But I really 
didn’t know Cathy very well, and 
I don’t know how well suited we 
would be. So all in all, maybe it 
would be best if we got out of 
here.” 

“Your words lack conviction, 
my young friend,” Valdez laugh- 
ed. “I beg of you not to worry 
about my safety.” 

“As a matter of fact,” Marvin 
said, “I was worrying about my 
safety.” 

“No use!” Valdez cried gaily. 
“Hot passion betrays the studied 
coolness of your words. Forward, 
my friend!” 



MINDSWAP

Valdez seemed determined to 
force him to Cathy’s side whether 
he wanted to go or not. The only 
solution seemed to be a quick 
blow to the jaw, after which he 
would drag Valdez and himself 
back to civilization. He edged 
forward. 

Valdez edged back. “Ah no, my 
friend!” he cried. “Again, over- 
weening love has rendered your 
motives transparent. To knock 
me out, is it not? 'Then, after 
making sure I was safe and com- 
fortable and well-provisioned, 
you would plunge alone into the 
white wilderness. But I refuse to 
comply. We go on together, com- 
padre!” 

And, shouldering all their pro- 
visions, Valdez began his descent 
of the precipice. Marvin could do 
nothing but follow. 

ITfe shall not bore the reader 
* * with an account of that 
great march across the Moorescu 
Mountains, nor with the agonies 
suffered by the love-dazzled 
young Flynn and his steadfast 
companion. Nor shall we deline- 
ate the strange hallucinations 
which beset the travellers, nor the 
temporary state of insanity 
which Valdez suffered when he 
thought he was a bird and able 
to fly across thousand-foot drops. 
Nor would any but the scholarly 
be interested in the psychological 
process by which Marvin was 

72 



moved, through a contemplation 
of his own sacrifices, to a fond- 
ness for the young lady in ques- 
tion, and then to a strong fond- 
ness, and then to a sensation of 
love, and then to an overween- 
ing passion of love. 

Suffice it to say that all of 
these things happened, and that 
the journey across the moun- 
tains occupied many days and 
brought about many emotions. 
And at last it came to an end. 

Arriving at a last mountain 
crest, Marvin looked down and 
saw, instead of ice fields, green 
pastures and rolling forests under 
a summer sun, and a little village 
nestled in the crook of a genie 
river. 

“Is — is that — ” Marvin began. 

“Yes, my son,” Valdez said 
quietly, “that is the village of 
Montana de los tres Picos, in 
Adelante Province, in the coun- 
try of Lombrobia, in the valley 
of the Blue Moon.” 

Marvin thanked his old guru — 
for no other name was applicable 
to the role which the devious and 
saintly Valdez had played — and 
began his descent to the Location 
Point where his wait for Cathy 
would begin.

/Tontana de los tres Picos! 
XV JL Here, surrounded by crystal 
lakes and high mountains, a

simple, good-hearted peasantry 
engage in unhurried labor be- 
neath the swan-necked palms. At 
midday and midnight one may 
hear the plaintive notes of a gui- 
tar echo down the crenellated 
walls of the old castle. Nut-brown 
maidens tend the dusty grape 
vines while a mustached caique 
watches, his whip curled sleepily 
on his hairy wrist. 

To this quaint memento of a 
bygone age came Flynn, led by 
the faithful Valdez. 

Just outside the village, on a 
gentle rise of land, there was an 
inn, or posada. To this place Val- 
dez directed them. 

“But is this really the best 
place to wait?” Marvin asked. 

“No, it is not,” Valdez said, 
with a knowing smile. “But by 
chosing it instead of the dusty 
town square, we avoid the fallacy 
of the ‘optimum’. Also, it is more 
comfortable here.” 

Marvin bowed to the mustach- 
ed man’s superior wisdom and 
made himself at home in the pos- 
ada. He settled himself at an out- 
door table which commanded a 
good view of the courtyard and 
of the road beyond it. He forti- 
fied himself with a flagon of 
wine, and proceeded to fulfill his 
theoretical function as called for 
by the Theory of Searches: viz, 
he Waited. 

Within the hour, Marvin be- 
held a tiny dark figure moving 

MINDSWAP 



slowly along the gleaming white 
expanse of the road. Closer it 
came, the figure of a man no 
longer young, his back bent be- 
neath the weight of a heavy cy- 
lindrical object. At last the man 
raised his haggard head and 
stared directly into Marvin' 
eyes. 

“Uncle Max!” Marvin cried. 

i CXX/hy, hello, Marvin,” Uncle 
’ ’ Max replied. “Would you 
mind pouring me a glass of wine? 
This is a very dusty road.” 

Marvin poured the glass of 
wine, scarcely believing the testi- 
mony of his senses; for Uncle 
Max had unaccountably disap- 
peared some ten years ago. He 
had last been seen playing golf 
at the Fairhaven Country Club. 

“What happened to you?” 
Marvin asked. 

“I stumbled into a time warp 
on the twelfth hole,” Uncle Max 
said. “If you ever get back to 
Earth, Marvin, you might speak 
to the club manager about it. I 
have never been a com plainer; 
but it seems to me that the greens 
committee ought to know about 
this, and possibly build a small 
fence or other enclosing structure. 
I do not care so much for myself, 
but it might cause a nasty scan- 
dal if a child fell in.” 

“I’ll certainly tell them,” Mar- 
vin said. “But Uncle Max, where 
are you going now?” 

73 



“I have an appointment in 
Samarra,” Uncle Max said. 
“Thank you for the wine, my 
boy, and take good care of your- 
self. By the way; did you know 
that your nose is ticking?” 

“Yes,” Marvin said. “It’s a 
bomb.” 

“I suppose you know what 
you’re doing,” Max said. “Good- 
by, Marvin.” 

And Uncle Max trudged away 
down the road, his golf bag 
swinging from his back and a 
number 2 iron in his hand as a 
walking stick. Marvin settled 
back to wait. 

Half an hour later, Marvin 
spied the figure of a woman 
hurrying down the road. He felt 
a rising sensation of anticipation, 
but then slumped back in his 
chair. It was not Cathy after all. 
It was only his mother. 

“You’re a long way from home. 
Mom,” he said quietly. 

“I know Marvin,” his mother 
said. “But you see, I was cap- 
tured by white slavers.” 

“Gosh. Mom! How did it hap- 
pen?” 

“Well, Marvin,” his mother 
said. “I was simply taking a 
Christmas basket to a poor fam- 
ily in Cutpurse Lane, and there 
was a police raid, and various 
other things happened, and I was 
drugged and awoke in Buenos 
Aires in a luxurious room with a 
man standing near me and leer- 
74 



ing and asking me in broken Eng- 
lish if I wanted a little fun. And 
when I said no, he bent down 
and clasped me in his arms in an 
embrace that was plainly design- 
ed to be lecherous.” 

“Gosh! What happened then?” 
“Well,” his mother said, “I was 
lucky enough to remember a lit- 
tle trick that Mrs. Jasperson had 
told me. Did you know that you 
can kill a man by striking him 
forcibly under the nose? I didn’t 
like to do it, Marvin, although it 
seemed a good idea at the time. 
And so I found myself in the 
streets of Buenos Aires and one 
thing led to another and here I 
am. 

“Won’t you have some wine?” 
Marvin asked. 

“That’s very thoughtful of 
you,” his mother said, “but I 
really must be on my way.” 
“Where?” 

“To Havana,” his mother said. 
“I have a message for Garcia. 
Marvin, have you a cold?” 

“No, I probably sound funny 
because of this bomb in my 
nose.” 

“Take care of yourself, Mar- 
vin,” his mother said, and hur- 
ried on. 

T ime passed. Marvin ate his 
dinner on the portico, washed 
it down with a flagon of Sangre 
de Hombre, ’36, and settled back 
in the deep shadow cast by the 

GALAXY 



whitewashed palladium. The sun 
stretched its golden bottom to- 
ward the mountain peaks. Down 
the road, the figure of a man 
could be seen hurrying past the 
inn . 

“Father!” Marvin cried. 

“Good afternoon, Marvin,” his 
father said, startled but hiding it 
well. “I must say, you turn up 
in some unexpected places.” 

“I could say the same for you,” 
Marvin said. 

His father frowned, adjusted 
his necktie and changed his brief- 
case to the other hand. “There is 
nothing strange about me being 
here,” he told his son. “Usually 
your mother drives me home 
from the station. But today she 
was delayed, and so I walked. 
Since I was walking, I decided 
to take the shortcut which goes 
over one side of the golf course.” 

“I see,” Marvin said. 

“I will admit,” his father con- 
tinued, “that this shortcut seems 
to have become a ‘long’ cut, as 
one might express it, for I esti- 
mate that I have been walking 
through this countryside for the 
better part of an hour, if no long- 
er.” 

“Dad,” Marvin said, “I don’t 
know how to tell you this, but 
the fact is, you are no longer on 
Earth.” 

“I find nothing humorous about 
a remark like that,” his father 
stated. “Doubtless I have gone 

MINDSWAP 



out of my way; nor is the style 
of architecture what I would 
normally expect to find in New 
York State. But I am quite cer- 
tain that if I continue along this 
road for another hundred yards 
or so, it will lead into Annandale 
Avenue, which in turn will take 
me to the intersection of Maple 
and Spruce Lane. From there, of 
course, I can easily find my way 
home.” 

“I suppose you’re right,” Mar- 
vin said. He had never been able 
to win an argument from his 
father. 

“I must be getting along,” his 
father said. “By the way, Mar- 
vin, were you aware that you 
have some sort of obstruction in 
your nose?” 

“Yes, sir,” Marvin said, “It’s 
a bomb.” 

His father frowned deeply, 
pierced him with a glance, shook 
his head regretfully and march- 
ed on down the road. 

1 4lT don’t understand it,” Mar- 

■M. vin remarked later to Val- 
dez. “Why are all of these peo- 
ple finding me? It just doesn’t 
seem natural.” 

“It isn’t natural,” Valdez as- 
sured him. “But it is inevitable, 
which is much more important.” 

“Maybe it is inevitable,” Mar- 
vin said. “But it is also highly 
improbable.” 

“True,” Valdez agreed “AI- 

75 



though we prefer to call that a 
forced-probability; which is to 
say, it is an indeterminate con- 
comitant of the Theory of 
Searches.” 

“I’m afraid I don’t fully under- 
stand that,” Marvin said. 

“Well, it’s simple enough. The 
Theory of Searches is a pure 
theory; which is to say that on 
paper it works every time. But 
once we attempt to make practi- 
cal applications, we encounter 
difficulties, the foremost of which 
is the phenomenon of indeter- 
minacy. To put it in its simplest 
terms, what happens is this: the 
presence of the Theory interferes 
with the working of the Theory. 
You see, the Theory cannot take 
into account the effect of its own 
existence upon itself. Ideally, 
Theory of Searches exists in a 
universe in which there is no 
Theory of Searches. But practi- 
cally — which is our concern here 
— the Theory of Searches exists 
in a world in which there is a 
Theory of Searches, which has 
what we call a ‘mirroring’ or 
‘doubling’ effect upon itself.” 

“Hmm,” said Marvin. 

“Of course,” Valdez added; 
“we must consider lambda-chi — 
the symbolic representation of 
the inverse ratio of all possible 
searches to all possible finds. 
Thus, when lambda-chi is increas- 
ed through indeterminacy or 
other factors, the possibility of 

76 



search-failure is rapidly reduced 
to a figure near zero, while the 
possibility of search-success ex- 
pands quickly toward one.” 
“Does that mean,” Marvin 
asked, “that because of the ef- 
fect of the Theory of Searches 
all searches will be successful?” 
“Exactly,” Valdez said. “You 
have expressed it beautifully, 
though perhaps with insufficient 
rigor. All possible searches will 
be successful during the time, or 
duration, of the Set-Expansion 
Factor.” 

“I understand now,” Marvin 
said. “According to the theory, 
I must find Cathy.” 

“Yes,” Valdez said. “You must 
find Cathy; as a matter of fact, 
you must find everyone. The only 
limitation is the Set-Expansion 
Factor, or S-E.” 

“Oh?” Marvin asked. 

CtTTTell, naturally, all search- 
* es can only be successful 
during the time, or duration, of 
S-E. But the duration of S-E 
is a variable which can last no 
less than 6.3 microseconds and 
no more than 1,005.34543 
years.” 

“How long will S-E last in my 
particular case?” Marvin asked. 

“A lot of us would like to know 
the answer to that one,” Valdez 
said, with a hearty chuckle. 

“I was afraid of that,” Marvin 
said. 



GALAXY 



“Science is a cruel taskmaster,” 
Valdez agreed. Then he winked 
cheerfully and said, “But of 
course, even the cruelest task- 
masters can be evaded.” 

“Do you mean to say there is 
a solution?” Marvin cried. 

“Not a legitimate one, unfor- 
tunately,” Valdez said. 

“Still,” Marvin said, “if it 
works, let’s try it out.” 

“I would really rather not,” 
Valdez said. 

“I insist,” Marvin said. “After 
nil, I am the one who is Search- 
ing.” 

“That has nothing to do with 
it, mathematically speaking,” 
Valdez said. “But I suppose you 
would give me no peace unless I 
indulged you.” 

Valdez sighed unhappily, sch- 
lepped a piece paper and a stub 
pencil out of his rebozo, and ask- 
ed, “How many coins do you 
have in your pocket?” 

Marvin looked and replied, 
"Eight.” 

Valdez wrote down the result, 
then asked for the date of Mar- 
vin’s birth, his social security 
number, his shoe size, and height 
in centimeter. To this he gave a 
numerical value. He asked Mar- 
vin to pick a number at random 
between 1 and 14. With this, he 
added several figures of his own, 
then scribbled and calculated for 
several minutes. 

“Well?” Marvin asked. 



“Remember, this result is 
merely statistically probable,” 
Valdez said, “and has no other 
grounds for credence.” 

Marvin nodded. Valdez said, 
“The Set-Expansion Factor, in 
your particular case, is due to ex- 
pire in exactly one minute and 
forty-eight seconds, plus or mi- 
nus five minimicroseconds.” He 
consulted his watch and nodded 
in satisfaction. 

Marvin was about to protest 
vehemently about the unfairness 
of this, and to ask why Valdez 
hadn’t made that vital calcula- 
tion earlier. 

But then he looked down upon 
the road, now glowing a singular 
white against the rich blue of 
evening. 

He saw a figure moving slowly 
toward the posada. 

“Cathy!” Marvin cried. For it 
was she. 

“Search completed with 43 
minimicro seconds of the Set-Ex- 
pansion Factor unelapsed,” Val- 
dez noted. “Another experimen- 
tal validation for my Search 
Theory.” 

But Marvin did not hear him, 
for he had rushed down to the 
road, and there clasped the long- 
lost beloved in his arms. And 
Valdez, the wily old friend and 
taciturn companion of the Long 
March, smiled tightly to himself 
and ordered another bottle of 
wine.

A nd so they were together at 
last; beautiful Cathy, star- 
crossed and planet haunted, 
drawn by the strange alchemy of 
the Location-Point; and Marvin, 
young and strong, with his swal- 
low’s flash smile in a tanned, 
good-humored face; Marvin, set- 
ting out with a young man’s au- 
dacity and easy confidence to 
conquer the challenge of an old 
and intricate universe; and Cathy 
at his side, younger than he in 
years, yet vastly older in her 
woman’s inherited store of intui- 
tive wisdom; lovely Cathy, whose 
fine dark eyes seemed to hold a 
brooding sorrow, an elusive sha- 
dow of anticipated sadness which 
Marvin was unaware of except 
to feel a great and almost over- 
whelming desire to protect and 
cherish this seemingly fragile girl 
with her secret which she could 
not reveal, who had come at last 
to him, a man without a secret 
which he could reveal. 

Their happiness was flawed 
and ennobled. There was the 
bomb in Marvin’s nose, ticking 
away the inexorable seconds of 
his destiny, providing a strict 
metronomic measure for their 
dance of love. But this sense of 
foredoomedness caused their op- 
posed destinies to twine closer, 
and it informed their relationship 
with grace and meaning. 



He created waterfalls for her 
out of the morning dew, and from 
the colored pebbles of a meadow 
stream he made a necklace more 
beautiful than emeralds, sadder 
than pearls. She caught him in 
her net of silken hair, she carried 
him down, down, into deep and 
silent waters, past obliteration. 
He showed her frozen stars and 
molten sun; she gave him long, 
entwined shadows and the sound 
of black velvet. He reached out 
to her and touched moss, grass, 
ancient trees, iridescent rocks; 
her fingertips, striving upwards, 
brushed old planets and silver 
moonlight, the flash of comets 
and the cry of dissolving suns. 

They played games in which 
he died and she grew old; they 
did it for the sake of the joyous 
rebirth. They dissected time with 
love, and put it back together 
longer, better, slower. They in- 
vented toys out of mountains, 
plains, lakes, valleys. Their souls 
glistened like healthy fur. 

They were lovers. They could 
conceive of nothing but love. 

But some things hated them. 
Dead stumps, barren eagles, 
stagnant ponds — these things 
resented their happiness. And 
certain urgencies of change ignor- 
ed their declarations, indifferent 
to human intentions and content 
to continue their work of break- 
ing down the universe. Certain 
conclusions, resistant to trans- 



78 



GALAXY 



formation, hastened to comply 
with ancient directives written on 
the bones, stencilled on the blood, 
tattooed into skin. 

There was a bomb which need- 
ed explosion. There was a secret 
which required betrayal. And out 
of fear came knowledge and sad- 
ness. 

And one morning, Cathy was 
gone as if she had never been. 

XXII 

/^one! Cathy was gone! Could 
it be possible? Could Life, 
that deadpan practical joker, be 
up to his disastrous tricks again? 

Marvin refused to believe it. 
He searched the confines of the 
posada, and he poked patiently 
through the little village beyond 
it. She was gone. He continued 
his search in the nearby city of 
San Ramon de las Tristezas, and 
he questioned waitresses, land- 
lords, shopkeepers, whores, 
policemen, pimps, beggars and 
other inhabitants. He asked if 
they had seen a girl fair as the 
dawn, with hair of indescribable 
beauty, limbs of a previously- 
unheard-of felicity, features 
whose comeliness was matched 
only by their harmony, etc. And 
those he questioned sadly replied, 
“Alas, senor, we have not seen 
thees woman, not now or ever 
in our lives.” 

He calmed himself enough to 



give a coherent description, and 
found a road-mender who had 
seen a girl like Cathy travelling 
west in a large automobile with 
a bulky, cigar-smoking man. And 
a chimney sweep had spied her 
leaving town with her little gold 
and blue handbag. Her step had 
been firm. 

Then a gas station attendant 
gave him a hastily scrawled note 
from Cathy which began, “Mar- 
vin dear, please try to under- 
stand and forgive me. As I tried 
to tell you so many times, it was 
necessary for me — ” 

The rest was illegible. 

With the aid of a cryptanalyst, 
Marvin deciphered the closing 
words, which were: “But I shall 
always love you, and I hope you 
can find it in your heart to think 
of me occasionally with kindness. 
Your Loving Cathy.” 

The rest of the note, made 
enigmatic by grief, was insuscep- 
tible to human analysis. 

To describe Marvin’s emotion 
would be like trying to describe 
the dawn flight of the heron: 
both are ineffable and unspeak- 
able. Suffice it to say that Mar- 
vin considered suicide, but de- 
cided against it. 

Nothing was enough. Intoxi- 
cation was merely maudlin. Re- 
nunciation of the world seemed 
no more than the act of a pee- 
vish child. Because of the inade- 
quacy of the attitudes open to

him. Marvin struck none. Dry- 
eyed and zombie-like he moved 
through his days and nights. He 
walked, he talked, he even smil- 
ed. He was unfailingly polite. But 
it seemed to his dear friend 
Valdez that the real Marvin had 
vanished in an instantaneous ex- 
plosion of sorrow, and that in 
his place there walked a poorly 
modeled representation of a man. 
Marvin was gone; the ringer who 
moved in his place looked as if, 
in its unfailing mimicry of hu- 
manness, it might collapse at any 
moment from strain. 

T J aldez was both perplexed and 
^ dismayed. Never had the 
wily old Master of Searches seen 
such a difficult case. With des- 
perate energy he tried to rally 
his friend out of his living death. 

He tried sympathy: “I know 
exactly how you feel, my un- 
fortunate companion, for once, 
when I was quite a young man, 
I had quite a comparable experi- 
ence, and I found — ” 

That did nothing, so Valdez 
tried brutality: “Christ damn me 
for a winnieburne, but are ye still 
mawking abaht after that bit of 
fluff wot walked out on yer? Now 
by God’s wounds, I tell thee this : 
there’s women past counting in 
this world of ours, and the man’s 
no man who’d curl himself up in 
the corner when there’s good 
lovin’ to be had without . .” 



No response. Valdez tried ec- 
centric distraction: 

“Look, look over there, I see 
three birds on a limb, and one 
has a knife thrust through its 
throat and a scepter clutched in 
its claw, and yet it sings more 
merrily than the others! What 
do you make of it, eh?” 

Marvin made nothing of it. Un- 
dismayed, Valdez tried to rouse 
his friend by piteous self-referral. 

“Well, Marvin, lad, the medics 
have taken a look at that skin 
rash of mine and it seems that 
it’s a case of pandemic impetigo. 
They give me twelve hours on 
the outside, after that I cash in 
mv chips and make room for an- 
other man at the table. But for 
mv last twelve hours, what I’d 
like to do is — ” 

Nothing. Valdez, attempt to stir 
his friend with philosophy: 

“The simple farmers know 
best, Marvin. Do you know what 
they say? They say that a broken 
knife makes a poor walking-stick. 
I think you should bear that in 
mind, Marvin . .” 

But Marvin absent-mindedly 
did not bear it in mind. Valdez 
swung to Hyperstrasian Ethics: 
“Thou considerest thyself 
wounded, then? But consider: 
Self is Ineffable and Unitary, 
and not Susceptible to Externali- 
ties. Therefore it is merely a 
Wound which was Wounded; and 
this, being External to the Per- 



80 



GALAXY 



son and Extraneous to the In- 
sight affords no Cause for the 
Imputation of Pain.” 

Marvin was not swayed. Val- 
dez turned to psychology: 

“Loss of the Beloved, accord- 
ing to Steinmetzer, is a ritual 
re-enactment of the loss of the 
Fecal Self. Therefore, amusingly 
enough, when we think we mourn 
the dear departed, we actually 
are grieving the irreparable loss 
of our excrement.” 

But this, too, could not pene- 
trate Marvin’s close-held passivi- 
ty. His melancholic detachment 
from all human values seemed 
irrevocable; and this impression 
was heightened when, one quiet 
afternoon, his nose ring stopped 
ticking. It was not a bomb at all 
it was merely a gray warning 
from Marduk Kras’s constituents. 
And thus Marvin no longer stood 
in imminent danger of having his 
head blown off. 

But even this stroke of good 
fortune did nothing to alter his 
robotic spirits. Quite unmoved, 
he noted the fact of his salva- 
tion as one might observe the 
passing of a cloud from the face 
of the sun. 

Nothing seemed to have any 
affect upon him. And even the 
patient Valdez, was finally led 
to exclaim: “Marvin, you are a 
goddam pain in the tail!” 

Yet Marvin perservered, un- 
moved. And it seemed to Valdez 



and to the good people of San 
Ramon that this man was beyond 
human recall. 



And yet, how little we know 
of the twists and turns of 
the human mind! For the very 
next day, contrary to all reason- 
able expectation, an event oc- 
curred which broke at last 
through Marvin’s reserve, and in- 
advertently threw wide the flood- 
gates of susceptibility behind 
which he had been hiding. 

A single event! (Though it was 
in itself the beginning of yet an- 
other chain of casualty — the quiet 
opening move of yet another of 
the uncountable dramas of the 
universe.) 

It began, absurdly enough, 
when Marvin glimpsed a face in 
the crowd. There was a strange 
and disturbing familiarity about 
that face. Where had he gazed 
upon that line of cheek and brow, 
those brown eyes with their faint 
tilt, that firm jaw? 

Then he remembered; he had 
seen it, long ago, in a mirror. 

It was the true and genuine 
face of Marvin Flynn; his very 
own face and body, long sought 
after, long denied him. It was the 
actual and original corpus of the 
unique and only Marvin Flynn — 
now animated by the criminal 
mind of Ze Kraggash, body- 
snatcher ! 

Marvin’s own face was sneering 



MINDSWAP 



81 



at him! And the real Marvin 
Flynn stepped forward, all passiv- 
ity stripped away, his fist raised 
in anger. 

Kraggash saw him and hesi- 
tated for a moment, his (Mar- 
vin’s) eyes a study in shock, his 
fingers betraying a fine tremor, 
and his downturned mouth re- 
vealing a hint of involuntary 
twitch. Then Kraggash whirled 
and fled into a narrow, dark and 
noisome alley. 

Common sense did not entirely 
desert Marvin Flynn. He paused 
at the mouth of that ominous 
cul-de-sac; prudence dictated 
that he look for assistance before 
venturing its hidden convolutions. 
But he had caught sight of a 
slender figure hurrying away on 
Kraggash’s arm. 

It could not be . And yet, it 
was indeed — Cathy! She looked 
back once, with no recognition in 
her gray eyes. Then she too dis- 
appeared into the alley’s serpen- 
tine coils. 

Rationality has its limits, as 
the lemmings well know’. Mar- 
vin’s emotions at this moment 
transcended his potentialities for 
self-control. He charged forward, 
his face flamed with insensate 
fury, his eyes bloodshot and un- 
seeing, cheeks ashen, lower jaw 
slack as a berserker’s, his upper 
lip drawn back in the risus sar- 
donicus of a Malay running 
amok. 



Five blind steps he took into 
that strait and infamous passage. 
And then a flagstone gave way 
beneath his feet, and a section 
of pavement pivoted on a con- 
cealed hinge. 

Marvin was catapulted head- 
long down a winding stone chute, 
while above him the judas-flag- 
stone pivoted neatly back into 
position. 

XXIII 

/Consciousness returned with ag- 
^ onizing ambiguity. Marvin 
opened his eyes and found that 
he was in an underground cell. 

The place was lighted only by 
the splutter of torches, set into 
paired iron embrochures on the 
wall. The ceiling seemed to press 
down upon him, stone-bellied and 
oppressive. From the cold gran- 
ite there depended bulging 
growths of fungus, which hung 
in obscene festoons. It was a 
place constructed for the desola- 
tion of the human spirit, whose 
chill granite was the temperature 
of the grave, whose acoustics 
were designed for the high- 
pitched shrill of pain, and whose 
color was the exact and sickening 
hue of mortality. 

Out of the shadows stepped 
Kraggash. “It would seem,” the 
criminal drawled, “that we have 
played this farce long enough. 
The denoument approaches.” 



82 



GALAXY 



“Have you then prepared your 
third act?” Marvin inquired 
steadily. 

“The actors have been given 
their cues,” Kraggash responded. 
Negligently he snapped his fin- 
gers. 

Into the circle of torchlight 
stepped Cathy. 

“This,” Marvin said simply, 
“lies beyond my comprehension.” 

“Oh, Marvin, can I ever ex- 
plain my apparent treachery?” 
Cathy cried, with tears dripping 
from her overcast gray eyes. 
“How can I make you under- 
stand the diverse and unpleasant 
reasons behind my marriage with 
Kraggash?” 

“Marriage!” Marvin cried. 

“I dared not tell you sooner, 
for fear it would anger you,” 
Cathy said piteously. “But be- 
lieve me, Marvin, he courted me 
with threats and indifference, and 
captivated me by a dark power 
which I cannot pretend to under- 
stand. And further, by the use of 
drugs and double-edged words 
and sly skillful movements of his 
hands he succeeded in bemusing 
my sense into a state of counter- 
feit passion, until I seemed to 
faint for touch of his damnable 
body and for nibblature of his de- 
testable lips. And since during 
this time I was denied the com- 
forts of religion, and therefore 
had no way of knowing the true 
from the induced, I did indeed 



succumb. Nor can I expect any 
forgiveness in this world or the 
next. Nor do I ask it.” 

“Oh Cathy, Cathy, my poor 
Cathy!” Marvin declaimed to the 
weeping girl. 

“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed Krag- 
gash. “A touching scene, but as 
ineffectual as it is apropos. But 
enough of this. There enters now 
the final actor of our farce!” 
Again Kraggash snapped his 
fingers. From the shadows 
stepped a masked man, clad in 
black from tip to toe, and carry- 
ing over his shoulder a great 
double-headed axe. 

“Good day to you, execution- 
er,” Kraggash drawled. “Forward 
now, and do your duty.” 

The executioner stepped for- 
ward and tested the edges of his 
great axe. He drew the weapon 
high over his head, stoop poised 
for a moment; and then — shock- 
ingly — he began to giggle. 

“Strike!” Kraggash howled. 
“Have you taken leave of your 
senses, man? Strike, I tell you!” 
But the executioner, still gig- 
gling, lowered his blade. Then, 
with skilled fingers, he plucked 
off his mask. 

( tT^etective Urdorf!” Marvin 
^ cried. 

“Yes, it is I,” the Martian de- 
tective said. “I am sorry we had 
to put you through so much anx- 
iety, Marvin; but it was our best 



MINDSWAP 



83 



opportunity of bringing your case 
to a successful conclusion. My 
colleague and I decided — ” 

“Colleague?” Marvin asked. 

“I refer,” Urdorf said, grinning 
wryly, “to special agent Cath- 
erine Mulvavey.” 

Marvin turned to Cathy. She 
had already pinned to her bodice 
the red and blue badge of a spe- 
cial agent in the Interplanetary 
Vigilance Association. 

“I — I think I understand,” 
Marvin said. 

“It’s really simple enough,” 
Detective Urdorf said. “In work- 
ing on your case, I had, as is usu- 
al, the aid and cooperation of 
various other law enforcement 
agencies. Upon three separate oc- 
casions we came close to captur- 
ing our man ; but always he evad- 
ed us. This might have gone on 
indefinitely had we not tried this 
scheme of entrapment. The 
theory was sound; for if Krag- 
gash could succeed in destroying 
you, he could claim your body 
as his own without fear of a 
counter-claimant. Whereas, as 
long as you were alive, you would 
continue to search for him. 

“Thus, we enticed you into this 
murderous scheme, hoping that 
Kraggash would take advantage 
of the opportunity of destroying 
you. The rest is history.” 

Turning to the criminal, De- 
tective Urdorf said, “Kraggash, 
have you anything to add?” 



The thief with Marvin’s face 
lounged gracefully against the 
wall, his arms folded and his 
body replete with composure. 

“I might hazard a comment or 
two,” Kraggash said. “First, let 
me point out that your scheme 
was clumsy and transparent. I 
believed it to be a hoax from the 
start, and entered it only on the 
distant possibility of it being true. 
Therefore, I am not surprised at 
this outcome.” 

“An amusing rationalization,” 
Urdorf said. 

Kraggash shrugged. “Second- 
ly, I want to tell you that I feel 
no moral compunction in the 
slightest at my so-called crime. 
If a man cannot retain control 
of his own body, then he deserves 
to lose it. I have observed, dur- 
ing a long and varied lifetime, 
that men will give their bodies 
to any rogue who asks, and will 
enslave their minds to the first 
voice that commands them to 
obey. This is why the vast major- 
ity of men cannot keep even their 
natural birthright of a mind and 
body, but choose instead to rid 
themselves of those embarrassing 
emblems of freedom.” 

U'T'hat,” Detective Urdorf 
-*■ said, “is the classic apol- 
ogia of the criminal.” 

“That which you call a crime 
when one man does it,” Kraggash 
said, “you call government when 



84 



GALAXY 



many men do it. Personally, I 
fail to see the distinction; and 
failing to see it, I refuse to live 
by it.” 

“We could stand here all year 
splitting words,” Detective Ur- 
dorf said. “But I do not have 
time for such recreation. Try 
your arguments on the prison 
chaplain, Kraggash. I hereby ar- 
rest you for illegal Mindswap- 
ping, attempted murder, and 
grand larceny. Thus I solve my 
158th case and break my chain of 
bad luck.” 

“Indeed?” Kraggash said cool- 
ly. “Did you really think it 
would be so simple? Or did you 
consider the possibility that the 
fox might have another lair?” he 
sneered at them. 

“Take him!” Detective Urdorf 
shouted. 

He, Marvin and Cathy moved 
swiftly toward Kraggash. But 
even as they moved, the criminal 
raised his hand and drew a swift 
circle in the air. 

The circle brilliantly glowed 
with fire! 

Kraggash put one leg over the 
circle. His leg disappeared. “If 
you want me,” he said mocking- 
ly, “you’ll know where to find 
me.” 

As they rushed him, Kraggash 
stepped into the circle, and all 
of him vanished except his head. 
He winked at Marvin, then his 
head was gone, and nothing was 




MINDSWAP 



left except the circle of fire. 

“Come on!” Marvin shouted. 
“Let’s get him!” 

He turned to Urdorf, and was 
amazed to see that the detective’s 
shoulders had slumped, and that 
his downcast face was gray with 
defeat. 

“Hurry!” Marvin cried. 

“It is useless,” Urdorf said. “I 
thought I was prepared for any 
ruse . but not for this. The 
man is obviously insane.” 

“What can we do?” Marvin 
shouted. 

‘We can do nothing,” Urdorf 
said. “He has gone into the 
Twisted World, and I have failed 
in my 158th case.” 

“But we can still follow him!” 
Marvin declared, moving up to 
the fiery circle. 

“No! You must not!” Urdorf 
declared. “You do not under- 
stand — the Twisted World means 
death, or madness ... or both! 
Your chances of coming through 
it are so small — ” 

“I have just as good a chance 
as Kraggash,” Marvin shouted 
and stepped into the circle. 

“Wait, you still do not under- 
stand!” Urdorf shouted. “Krag- 
gash has no chance /” 

But Marvin did not hear those 
final words, for he had already 
vanished through the flaming 
circle, moving inexorably into the 
strange and unexplored reaches 
of the Twisted World.

SOME EXPLANATIONS OF 
THE TWISTED WORLD 
“. thus, through the Rie- 
mann-Hake equations, a math- 
ematical demonstration existed at 
last of the theoretical necessity 
for Twistermann’s Soatial Area 
of Logical Deformation. This 
Area became known as the Twist- 
ed World, though it was neither 
twisted nor a world. And, by a 
final irony, Twistermann’s all- 
imnortant third definition (that 
the Area could be considered as 
that region of the universe which 
acted as an equinoise of chaos to 
the logical stability of the pri- 
mary structure) was proven 
superfluous.”

World,” from the Galactic En- 
cyclopedia of Universal Knowl- 
edge, 483rd edition. 

“. therefore, the term mir- 
ror-deformation carries the sense 
(if not the substance) of our 
thought. For indeed, as we have 
seen, the Twisted World (sic) 
performs the work, both neces- 
sary and hateful, of rendering in- 
determinate all entities and pro- 
cesses, and thereby making the 
universe theoretically as well as 
practically ineluctable.”

matician,” Edgar Hope Grief,

B ut despite this, a few very 
tentative rules might be ad- 
duced for the suicidal traveller 
to the Twisted World: 

Remember that all rules may 
lie, in the Twisted World; in- 
cluding this rule which points out 
the exception, and including this 
modifying clause which invali- 
dates the exception ... ad infin- 
itum. 

But also remember that no 
rule necessarily lies; that any 
rule may be true, including this 
rule and its exceptions. 

In the Twisted World, time 
need not follow your preconcep- 
tions. Events may change rapidly 
(which seems proper), or slowly 
(which feels better), or not at all 
(which is hateful). 

It is conceivable that nothing 
whatsoever will happen to you in 
the Twisted World. It would be 
unwise to expect this, and equal- 
ly unwise to be unprepared for 
it. 

Among the kingdoms of prob- 
ability which the Twisted World 
sets forth, one must be exactly 
like our World; and another 
must be exactly like our world 
except for one detail; and anoth- 
er exactly like ours except for two 
details; and so forth. And also — 
one must be completely unlike 
our world except for one detail; 
and so forth. 

The problem is always predic- 
tion; how to tell what world you 



are in before the Twisted World 
reveals it disastrously to you. 

In the Twisted World, as in 
any other, you are apt to discov- 
er yourself. But only in the 
Twisted World is that meeting 
usually fatal. 

Familiarity breeds shock — in 
the Twisted World. 

The Twisted World may con- 
veniently (but incorrectly) be 
thought of as a reversed world of 
Maya, of illusion. You may find 
that the shapes around you are 
real; while You, the examining 
consciousness, are illusion. Such 
a discovery is enlightening, al- 
beit mortifying. 

A wise man once asked, “What 
would happen if I could enter the 
Twisted World without precon- 
ceptions?” A final answer to his 
question is impossible; but we 
would hazard that he would have 
some preconceptions by the time 
he came out. Lack of opinion is 
not armor. 

Some men feel that the height 
of intelligence is the discovery 
that all things may be reversed, 
and thereby become their oppos- 
ites. Many clever games can be 
played with this proposition; but 
we do not advocate its use in the 
Twisted World. There all doc- 
trines are equally arbitrary, in- 
cluding the doctrine of the arbi- 
trariness of doctrines. 

Do not expect to outwit the 
Twisted World. It is bigger, 



MINDSWAP 



87 



•mailer, longer and shorter than 
you. It does not prove. It is. 

Something which is never has 
to prove anything. All proofs are 
attempts at becoming. A proof is 
true only to itself; and it implies 
nothing except the existence of 
proofs — which prove nothing. 

Anything which is, is improb- 
able, since everything is extra- 
neous, unnecessary and a threat 
to the reason. 

These comments concerning 
The Twisted World may have 
nothing to do with the Twisted 
World. The traveller is warned.

the Specious,” by Ze Kraggash;

r f- , he transition was abrupt, and 
not at all what Marvin 
thought it would be. He had 
heard stories about the Twisted 
World, and had hazily expected 
to find a place of melting shapes 
and shifting colors, of grotesques 
and marvels. But he saw at once 
that his viewpoint had been ro- 
mantic and limited. 

He was in a small waiting- 
room. The air was stuffy with 
sweat and steam heat, and he 
sat on a long wooden bench with 
several dozen other people. 
Bored -looking clerks strolled up 
and down, consulting papers, and 



occasionally calling for one of 
the waiting people. Then there 
would be a whispered confer- 
ence. Sometimes a man would 
lose patience and leave. Some- 
times a new applicant would ar- 
rive. 

Marvin waited, watched. 

Time passed slowly, the room 
grew shadowy, someone switched 
on overhead lights. Still no one 
called his name. Marvin glanced 
at the men on either side of him, 
bored rather than curious. 

The man on his left was very 
tall and cadaverous, with an in- 
flamed boil on his neck where the 
collar rubbed. The man on his 
right was short and fat and red- 
faced, and he wheezed with every 
breath. 

“How much longer do you 
think it should take?” Marvin 
asked the fat man, more to pass 
the time than in a serious attempt 
to gain knowledge. 

“Long? How long?” the fat 
man said. “Damned long, that’s 
how long it’ll take. You can t 
hurry their goddamned majesties 
here in the Automobile Bureau, 
not even when all you want is to 
have a perfectly ordinary driv- 
er’s license renewed, which is 
what I’m here for.” 

The cadaverous man laughed: 
a sound like a stick of wood rap- 
ping against an empty gasoline 
can. 

“You’ll wait a goddamned long 



88 



GALAXY 



time, baby,” he said, “since you 
happen to be sitting in the De- 
partment of Welfare, Small Ac- 
counts Division.” 

Marvin spat thoughtfully on 
the dusty floor and said, “It hap- 
pens that both of you gentlemen 
are wrong. We are seated in the 
Department, in the anteroom of 
the Department, to be precise, of 
the Department of Fisheries, I 
was trying to say. And in my 
opinion it is a pretty state of af- 
fairs when a citizen and tax- 
payer cannot even go fishing in 
a tax-supported body of water 
without wasting half a day or 
more applying for a license.” 

The three glared at each other. 
(There are no heroes in the 
Twisted World, damned few 
promises, a mere scattering of 
viewpoints, and not a conclusion 
in a carload.) 

f | 'hey stared at each other with 
not particularly wild surmise. 
The cadaverous man began to 
bleed slightly from the fingertips. 
Marvin and the fat man frowned 
with embarrassment and affected 
not to notice. The cadaverous 
man jauntily thrust his offending 
hand into a waterproof pocket. A 
clerk came over to them. 

“Which of you is James Grin- 
nell Starmacher?” the clerk 
asked. 

“That’s me,” Marvin replied. 
“And I want to say that I’ve 



been waiting here for some little 
time, and I think this Department 
is run in quite an inefficient fash- 
ion.” 

“Yeah, well,” the clerk said, 
“it’s because we haven’t got in 
the machines yet.” He glanced 
at his papers. “You have made 
application for a corpse?” 

“That is correct,” Marvin said. 
“And you affirm that said 
corpse will not be used for im- 
moral purposes?” 

“I so affirm.” 

“Kindly state your reasons for 
acquiring this corpse.” 

“I wish to use it in a purely 
decorative capacity.” 

“Your qualifications?” 

“I have studied interior decor- 
ating.” 

“State the name and/or identi- 
fication code number of the most 
recent corpse obtained by you.” 
“Cockroach,” Marvin replied, 
“Brood number 3/32/A45345.” 
“Killed by?” 

“Myself. I am licensed to kill 
all creatures not of my subspe- 
cies, with certain exceptions such 
as the golden eagle and the man- 
ates.” 

“The purpose of your last kill- 
ing?” 

“Ritual purification.” 

“Request granted,” the clerk 
said. “Choose your corpse.” 

The fat man and the cadaver- 
ous man looked at him with wet, 
hopeful eyes. Marvin was tempt- 



MINDSWAP 



89 



ed, but managed to resist. He 
turned and said to the clerk, “I 
choose you.” 

“It shall be so noted,” the clerk 
said, scribbling on his papers. His 
face changed to the face of the 
pseudo-Flynn. Marvin burrowed 
a cross-cut saw from the cadav- 
erous man, and, with some diffi- 
culty, cut the clerk’s right arm 
from his body. The clerk expired 
unctuously, his face changing 
once again to his clerk’s face. 

The fat man laughed at Mar- 
vin’s discomfiture. “A little trans- 
substantiality goes a long way,” 
he sneered. “But not far enough, 
eh? Desire shapes flesh, but death 
is the final sculptor.” 

Marvin was crying. The cadav- 
erous man touched his arm in a 
kindly manner. “Don’t take it so 
hard, kid. Symbolic revenge is 
better than no revenge at all. 
Your plan was good; its flaw was 
external to yourself. I am James 
Grinnell Starmacher.” 

“I am a corpse,” said the 
clerk’s corpse. “Transposed re- 
venge is better than no revenge.” 
“I came here to renew my driv- 
ing license,” the fat man said. 
“To hell with all you deep think- 
ers, how about a little service?” 
“Certainly, sir,” said the corpse 
of the clerk. “But in my present 
condition, I can license you only 
to fish for dead fish.” 

“Dead, alive, what difference 
does it make?” the fat man said. 



“Fishing is the thing; it doesn’t 
matter so much what you catch.” 

He turned to Marvin, perhaps 
to amplify that statement. But 
Marvin had left. 

— and, after an unpersuasive 
transition, found himself in a 
large, square, empty room. 

nphe walls were made of steel 
plates, and the ceiling was a 
hundred feet above his head. 
There were floodlights up there, 
and a glassed-in control booth. 
Peering at him through the glass 
was Kraggash. 

“Experiment 342,” Kraggash 
intoned crisply. “Subject; Death. 
Proposition: Can a human being 
be killed? Remarks: This ques- 
tion concerning the possible mor- 
tality of human beings has long 
perplexed our finest thinkers. A 
considerable folklore has sprung 
up around the subject of death, 
and unverified reports of killings 
have been made throughout the 
ages. Furthermore, corpses have 
been brought forth from time to 
time, indubitably dead, and rep- 
resented as the remains of human 
beings. Despite the ubiquity of 
these corpses, no casual link has 
ever been proven to show that 
they ever lived, much less that 
they were once human beings. 
Therefore, in an attempt to settle 
the question once and for all, we 
have set up the following experi- 
ment. Step one .

GALAXY 



A steel plate in the wall flew 
back on its hinge. Marvin whirled 
in time to see a spear thrust forth 
at him. He sidestepped, made 
clumsy by his lame foot, and 
evaded the thrust. 

More plates popped open. 
Knives, arrows' clubs, all were 
flung at him from various angles. 

A poison gas generator was 
pushed through an opening. A 
tangle of cobras was dropped in- 
to the room. A lion and a tank 
bounded forward. A blowgun 
hissed. Energy weapons crackled. 
Flamethrowers coughed. A mor- 
tar cleared its throat. 

Water flooded the room, rising 
quickly. Naptha fire poured 
down from the ceiling. 

But the fire burned the lions, 
which ate the snakes, which 
clogged the howitzers, which 
crushed the spears, which 
jammed the gas generator, which 
dissolved the water which quen- 
ched the fire. 

Marvin stood forth miraculous- 
ly unscathed. He shook his fist 
at Kraggash, slipped on the steel 
plating, fell and broke his neck. 
He was afforded a military fu- 
neral with full honors. His widow 
died with him on the flaming 
pyre. Kraggash tried to follow, 
but was refused the solace of 
suttee. 

Marvin lay in the tomb for 
three days and three nights, dur- 
ing which time his nose dripped 



continuously. His entire life 
passed before his eyes in slow- 
motion. At the end of that time 
he arose and moved onward. 

'Pphere were five objects of 
-*■ limited but undeniable sen- 
tience in a place with no qualities 
worth mentioning. One of these 
objects was, presumably, Mar- 
vin. The other four were lay fig- 
ures, hastily sketched stereotypes 
designed for the sole purpose of 
adorning the primary situation. 
The problem confronting the five 
was, which of them was Marvin, 
and which were the unimportant 
background figures. 

First came a question of 
nomenclature. Three of the five 
wished to be called Marvin im- 
mediately, one wanted to be 
called Edgar Floyd Morrison, 
and one wished to be referred to 
as “unimportant background fig- 
ure.” 

This was quite obviously ten- 
dentious, and so they numbered 
themselves from one to four, the 
fifth stubbornly insisting upon 
being called Kelly. 

“All right, already,” said Num- 
ber One, who had already taken 
on officious air. “Gentlemen, 
could we maybe stop beating our 
gums and bring this meeting to 
order?” 

“A Jewish accent won’t help 
you here,” Number Three said 
darkly. 



MINDSWAP

“Look,” said Number One, 
“what would a Polack know 
about Jewish accents? As it hap- 
pens, I am Jewish only on my 
father’s side, and although I es- 
teem — ” 

“Where am I?” said Number 
Two. “My God, what happened 
to me? Ever since I left Stan- 
hope . 

“Shut up, Wop,” Number Four 
said. 

“My name-a not Wop, my 
name-a shesa Luigi,” Number 
Two responded swarthily. “I bin 
two year in your greata country 
ever’ since I leetle boy in village 
San Minestrone della Zuppa, 
nicht wahr?” 

“Sheet, man,” Number Three 
said darkly. “You ain’t no dago- 
wop stall nohow, you ain’t nuttin 
but jes’ a plain ornary provision- 
al background figure of limited 
flexibility; so suppose you jes 
shut you mout afore I do dat 
little ting for you, nicht wahr?” 

“Listen,” said Number One, 
“I’m a simple man of simple 
tastes and if it’ll help any I’ll 
give up my rights to Marvin- 
hood.” 

“Memory, memory,” muttered 
Number Two. “What has hap- 
pened to me? Who are these ap- 
paritions, these talkative shades?” 

“Oh I say!” Kelly said. “That’s 
really bad form, old man!” 

“Itsa pretty goddamn disin- 
genuous,” muttered Luigi. 

92 



“Invocation is not convoca- 
tion,” said Number Three. 

“But I really don’t remember,” 
said Number Two. 

“So I don’t remember so good 
neither,” said Number One. “But 
do you hear me making a big 
thing of it? I’m not even claiming 
to be human. The mere fact that 
I can recite Leviticus by heart 
don’t prove nothing.” 

“Too right it doesn’t!” shouted 
Luigi. “And disproof don’t prove 
any flaming thing neither.” 

“I thought you were supposed 
to be Italian,” Kelly said to him. 

“I am, but I was raised in 
Australia. It’s rather a strange 
story — ” 

“No stranger than mine,” Kelly 
said. “Black Irishman do you 
call me? But few know that I 
passed my formative years in a 
Hangchow dosshouse, and that 
I enlisted in the Canadian army 
to escape French persecution for 
my part in aiding the Gaullists 
in Mauretania. That is why — ” 
“Zut, alors!” cried Number 
Four. “One can keep silence no 
longer! To question my creden- 
tials is one thing; to asperse my 
country is another!” 

“Yer indignation don’t prove a 
thing!” Number Three cried. 
“Not that I really care, since I 
choose no longer to be Marvin.” 
“Passive resistance is a form of 
aggression,” Number Four re- 
sponded. 



GALAXY 



“Inadmissable evidence is still 
a form of evidence,” Three re- 
torted. 

“I don’t know what any of you 
are talking about,” Number Two 
declared. 

“Ignorance will get you no- 
where,” Number Four snarled. 
“I refuse categorically to be Mar- 
vin.” 

“You can’t give up what you 
haven’t got,” Kelly said archly. 

“I can give up anything I 
damned well want to!” Number 
Four cried passionately. “I not 
only give up my Marvinity; I 
also step down from the throne 
of Spain, yield up the dictator- 
ship of the Inner Galaxy and re- 
nounce my salvation in Bah’ai.” 
“Feel better now, kid? Sim- 
plification suits my intricate na- 
ture,” Number Four said. “Which 
of you is Kelly?” 

“I am,” Kelly said. 

“Do you realize,” Luigi asked 
him, “that only you and I have 
names?” 

“That’s true,” Kelly said. “You 
and I are different!” 

“Here now, just a moment!” 
Number One said. 

“Time gentlemen, time, 
please!” 

“Hold the fort!” 

“Hold your water!” 

“Hold the phone!” 

“As I was saying,” Luigi said. 
“We! Us! The Named Ones of 
the Proof Presumptive! Kelly — 



you can be Marvin if I can be 

Kraggasli!” 

“Done!” roared Kelly, over the 
protests of the lay figures. 

Marvin and Kraggash grinned 
at each other in the momentary 
euphoria of identity-intoxication. 
Then they flung themselves at 
each other’s throats. Manual 
strangulation followed. The three 
numbered ones, robbed of a birth- 
right they had never possessed, 
took up conventional poses of 
stylized ambiguity. The two let- 
tered ones, granted an identity 
they had seized anyhow, tore and 
bit at each other, flung forth defi- 
ant arias and cringed before deva- 
stating recitations. Number One 
watched until he grew bored, 
then began playing with a lap 
dissolve. 

That did it. The whole shoot- 
ing works slid away like a greased 
pig on roller skates coming down 
a solid glass mountain, only 
slightly faster. 

Day succeeded night, which 
succeeded in making a perfect 
fool of itself.

hey . 

were . 

. locked in titanic combat, 
which, since it had happened, 
was inevitable. Marvin smote 
Kraggash upon the breastbone, 
then smote him again upon the 
nose-bone. Kraggash promptly 
changed into Ireland, which Mar- 
vin invaded as a demi-legion of 
Danish berserkers, forcing Krag- 
gash to attempt a kingside pawn- 
storm, which stood no chance 
against a low flush. Marvin 
reached for his opponent, missed 
and devastated Atlantis. Krag- 
gash swung backhanded and 
slaughtered a gnat. 

Deadly the battle raged across 
the steaming swamps of the Mio- 
cene; a colony of termites 
mourned their queen as Krag- 
gash cometed helplessly into 
Marvin’s sun, fragmenting at last 
into countless militant spores. 
But Marvin unerringly picked 
the diamond from the glittering 
glass, and Kraggash fell back 
upon Gibraltar. 

His bastion fell in a night when 
Marvin kidnapped the barbary 
apes, and Kraggash speeded 
across southern Thrace with his 
body in a suitcase. He was seized 
at the frontier of Phthistia, a 
country which Marvin impro- 
vised. 



Weakening, Kraggash became 
evil; becoming evil, Kraggash 
grew weak. In vain he invented 
devil-worship. The followers of 
Marvinity bowed down not to the 
idol, but rather to the symbol. 
Evil, Kraggash turned nasty: dirt 
grew beneath his fingernails, nox- 
ious tufts of hair appeared on his 
soul. 

Helpless at last Kraggash lay, 
the incarnation of evil, with the 
body of Marvin clutched in his 
talon. Rites of exorcism induced 
his final agony. A buzz saw dis- 
guised as a prayer-wheel dis- 
membered him, a mace masquer- 
ading as a censor brained him. 
Kindly old Father Flynn intoned 
over him the last words: “Thou 
gettest no bread with one meat 
ball.” And Kraggash was put in- 
to a tomb hewn out of the living 
Kraggash. Appropriate graffiti 
were carved upon his tombstone, 
and flowering Kraggash was 
planted around his grave. 

It is a quiet spot. To the left 
is a grove of Kraggash trees, to 
the right is an oil refinery. Here 
is an empty beer can, here is a 
gypsy moth. And just beyond is 
the spot where Marvin opened 
the suitcase and took out his 
long-lost body. 

He blew the dust off it and 
combed its hair. He wiped its 
nose and straightened its tie. 
Then, with seemly reverence, he 
put it on.

GALAXY

A nd thus Marvin Flynn found 
himself back on Earth and 
inside his own body. 

He went to his home town of 
Stanhope, and found things un- 
changed. The town was still some 
three hundred miles from New 
York in physical distance, and 
some hundred years away in 
spiritual and emotional distance. 
Just as before there were the 
orchards, and the clusters of 
brown cows grazing against the 
rolling green pastureland. Eter- 
nal was the elm-lined Main 
Street and the lonely late-night 
wail of a jetliner. 

No one asked Marvin where 
he had been. Not even his best 
friend, Billy Hake, who assumed 
he had taken a jaunt to one of 
the regular tourist spots like 
Sinkiang or the lower Ituri Rain 
Forest. 

At first, Marvin found this in- 
vincible stability as upsetting as 
he had ever found the tranposi- 
tions of Mindswap or the de- 
formed conundrums of the Twist- 
ed World. Stability seemed exotic 
to him; he kept on waiting for 
it to fade away. 

But places like Stanhope do 
not fade, and boys like Marvin 
gradually lose their sense of en- 
chantment and high purpose. 

Alone late at night in his attic 
room, Marvin often dreamed of 



Cathy. He still found it difficult 
to think of her as a special agent 
of the Planetary Vigilance As- 
sociation. And yet, there had 
been a hint of officiousness in her 
manner, and a glint of the right- 
eous prosecutor in her eyes. 

He loved her and would always 
mourn her loss; but he was more 
content to mourn her than to 
possess her. 

And, if the truth must be told, 
Marvin’s eye had already been 
caught, or recaptured, by Marsha 
Baker, the demure and attractive 
young daughter of Edwin Marsh 
Baker, Stanhope’s leading real es- 
tate dealer. 

Stanhope, if not the best of all 
possible worlds, was still the best 
world Marvin had seen. It was a 
place where you could live with- 
out things jumping out at you 
and you jumping out at things. 
No metaphoric deformation was 
possible in Stanhope; a cow 
looked exactly like a cow, and to 
call it anything else was unwar- 
rantable poetic license. 

And so, undoubtedly : east, 

west, home’s the best; and Mar- 
vin set himself the task of enjoy- 
ment of the familiar, which senti- 
mental wise men say is the apex 
of human wisdom. 

His life was marred only by 
one or two small doubts. First 
and foremost was the question: 
How had he come back to Earth 
from the Twisted World? 



MINDSWAP 



95 



TT e did considerable research 
on this question, which was 
more ominous than it first seem- 
ed. He realized that nothing is 
impossible in the Twisted World, 
and that nothing is even improb- 
able. There is causality in the 
Twisted World, but there is also 
non-causality. Nothing must be; 
nothing is necessary. 

Because of this, it was quite 
conceivable that the Twisted 
World had flung him back to 
Earth, showing its power by re- 
linquishing its power over Mar- 
vin. 

That indeed seemed to be 
what had happened. But there 
was another, less pleasant alter- 
native. 

This was expressed in the 
Doorham Propositions as follows : 
“Among the kingdoms of prob- 
ability which the Twisted World 
sets forth, one must be exactly 
like our world, and another must 
be exactly like our world except 
for one detail, and another exact- 
ly like our world except for two 
details, and so forth.” 

Which meant that he might 
still be on the Twisted World, 
and that this Earth which he 
perceived might be no more than 
a passing emanation, a fleeting 
moment of order in the funda- 
mental chaos, destined to be dis- 
solved at any moment back into 
the fundamental senselessness of 
the Twisted World. 



In a way it made no difference, 
since nothing is permanent except 
our illusions. But no one likes to 
have his illusions threatened, and 
Marvin wanted to know where 
he stood. 

Was he on Earth, or was he on 
a replica of Earth? 

Might there not be some signi- 
ficant detail inconsistent with 
the Earth he had left? Might 
there not be several details? Mar- 
vin tried to find out for the sake 
of his peace of mind. He explored 
Stanhope and its environs, looked 
and tested and checked the flora 
and fauna. 

Nothing seemed to be amiss. 
Life went on as usual; his father 
tended his herds of rats, and his 
mother placidly continued to lay 
eggs. 

He went north to Boston and 
New York, then further south to 
the vast Philadelphia-Los Ange- 
les area. Everything seemed in 
order. 

He contemplated sailing east 
across the continent on the 
mighty Delaware River and con- 
tinuing his search in the Califor- 
nia cities of Schenectady, Mil- 
waukee and Shanghai. 

He changed his mind, however, 
realizing that there was no 
sense in spending his life trying 
to discover whether or not he had 
a life to spend. 

Besides, there was the possi- 
bility that, even if the Earth 



96 



GALAXY 



were changed, his memory and 
perceptions might also be 
changed, rendering discovery 
impossible. 

T T e lay beneath Stanhope’s 
* familiar green sky and con- 
sidered this possibility. It seemed 
unlikely: for did not the giant 
oak trees still migrate each year 
to the south? Did not the huge 
red sun move across the sky, pur- 



sued by its dark companion? Did 
not the triple moons return each 
month with their new accumula- 
tion of comets? 

These familiar sights reassur- 
ed him. Everything seemed to 
be as it always had been. And 
so, willingly and with a good 
grace, Marvin accepted his 
world at face value, married 
Marsha Baker and lived forever 
after. — ROBERT SHECKLEY

FORECAST 

Next issue's lead story is called Do I Wake or Dream?, and it's by some- 
one you've heard of before, ft is, in fact, by the man who wrote Dune World, 
Under Pressure and a goodly number of other recent, memorable science- 
fiction stories, Frank Herbert. Although Herbert is no stranger to Galaxy, 
this is by all odds the longest story of his we've been able to publish; even 
longer than Robert Sheckley's Mindswap in the current issue, and we give 
you fair warning that it's going to crowd us in spite of Galaxy's largest- 
number-of-pages-in-science-fiction. 

Still, that's the way we have to publish this particular story. It concerns 
a handful of people on a long-line trip to another star, in an experimental 
ship guided and operated by a computer. Or so it seems. But in fact the 
people are not exactly what you think; the trip is not precisely what they 
expect; and the computer — Well, you'll see when you read it. Herbert has 
written it brilliantly, inventively and with a growing pace and tension; but 
in doing so he has so arranged things that it would be distinctly unfair for 
us to split it up into a serial. Ergo — complete in our next: Do / Wake or 
Dream? 

It will crowd us . but we think it's going to be worth it. 

Also for sure is Willy Ley's column (on giant stars) and Algis Budrys's 
books reviews. We've got some really first-rate novelettes in stock — 
Cordwainer Smith, James Blish and Norman L. Knight, etc. — and at least 
one of them will be with us, as well, no doubt, as an additional short or 
two; but just which remain to be seen. But it will be a good issue, we're 
pretty sure of that. In fact, from now on it's our personal opinion that they'll 
all be.

SERVANT PROBLEM 



by OTIS KIDWELL BURGER 



They also serve who only stand 
and wait — wait for a way out/ 



T he sandstorms had been 
worse than usual that day, 
rattling the window panes of the 
Central Office Building on the 
planet Dexter, and sifting all 
afternoon over the outlying set- 
tlement of prefabs. 

Sandstorms were the worst 
feature of a climate mostly far 
better then that of the other 
colonized planets in that part of 
tl>e universe, but generally they 
w^re restricted to a brief after- 
noon flurry. On such bad days, 
however, they blew daylong. 
E*usk came early, and the whine 
o£ wind and sand, sweeping in 
fr-om the surrounding deserts, 
emphasized the loneliness and 
romoteness of the little outpost 
town. Paint rasped from houses. 
S and drifted in streets and gar- 



dens; leveling, reclaiming hu- 
man habitation back into desert 
and alien space. Work habits 
and tempers snapped. 

Lights had gone on early in 
the Central Office. Most of the 
personnel had left. Jim Richards 
had been kept late, in a wind- 
haunted lighted emptiness, to re- 
do some sloppily compiled re- 
ports. His wife had called three 
times, mostly to complain about 
the weather. 

When she called again, to say 
she had forgotten to get his 
shirts from the laundry (prob- 
ably closed now), and that it was 
time to take Miss Sissing to the 
bus, he blew up. 

“Why the hell didn’t you get 
my shirts?” 

“I wasn’t feeling welL” 



98 



“So send Miss Sissing for the 
shirts. What’re servants for? Or 
better yet, whyn’t you drive her 
to the bus now, and get the 
shirts, too? Why does it always 
have to be me? I work all day. 
Do I have to run all the er- 
rands too?” 

“I’m not feeling well.” 

“You never are.” 

“It’s the beginning of the ser- 
vants’ vacation today,” she said, 
even more feebly. “She’s got to 
be there.” 

“So let her wait a few min- 
utes. The bus doesn’t leave for 
hours.” 

“You know she’s got to be 
there early.” 

T Y e slammed down the 
•*- phone, fully determined to 
let Miss Sissing wait, for once. 
All Dexter’s servants went back, 
four times a year, to spend their 
vacations on Dexter’s two 
moons. It was generally a time 
of inconvenience and bad tem- 
per. No. Let Miss Sissing wait. 

At this point, all the office 
fuses blew out. 

With no excuse to linger in the 
dark, he drove home. The dark, 
dust-scoured streets were empty 
and derelict, and the toy-like 
little houses with their neat, ar- 
tificial gardens around them 
looked forlorn and shuttered. 
Most of the other servants had 
presumably already been taken 



to the bus station. He tried to 
dawdle further, but the little air- 
propelled car suddenly refused 
to work properly, except at high 
speeds; and he found himself at 
home, and then driving Miss Sis- 
sing to her bus, far sooner than 
he had intended. 

Beside her, driving through 
the dark streets, he was aware of 
her pinched, spinsterish profile; 
the straw hat jammed over a 
bun of graying hair, the faded 
eyes behind steel-rimmed spec- 
tacles. A humanoid caricature. 
The private life of these alien 
beings was unimaginable to him. 
What did she do on vacation? 
Play croquet and read bad nov- 
els? he thought, hating equally 
her presence and her absence. 
There was no doubt the servants 
were a convenience. They were 
assigned to all the couples on 
the base, along with a pre-fab- 
house and an air-car. Since most 
of the newly-wed wives, like 
Jim’s, were sick much of the 
time with gravity and climate, 
the servants were often a nec- 
essity. Miss Sissing, in some 
ways, was ideal. An excellent 
cook and housekeeper. Unobtru- 
sive. Well, not always, really. 
Not if, and when, during Jim’s 
and Barbara’s frequent quarrels, 
he was always aware of her pres- 
ence. Scrimpy prim spinster! 
Bad as having a mother-in-law. 

He dropped Miss Sissing at 



SERVANT PROBLEM 



99 



the bus station, a big half-empty 
landing field on the edge of 
town. There was little traffic, ex- 
cept for the buses, and occasion- 
al ships that stopped in from 
other planets. Idling his car, he 
watched her climb out and join 
all the other servants, who were 
still filing into the huge bare 
barn-like airport at the end of 
the field, to wait for the depar- 
ture of their flight. 

“Night, Mr. Richards.” 

“Night, Miss Sissing,” he 
said grudgingly. “See you next 
week.” 

He had planned to by-pass 
the laundry all together, and say 
it had been closed (heaping 
coals on Barbara’s head), and 
perhaps drop in instead on Mrs. 
Rapp. For a drink, at least. 

Mrs. Rapp’s husband had 
been the one, of that couple, 
who had been unable to stand 
the climate. He had in fact died 
some months ago. Mrs. Rapp 
had been widely and discreetly 
consoled ever since. 

But just outside the laundry, 
the car’s motor suddenly died. 
He got out. While he was staring 
at the hood, the laundryman 
recognized him and brought out 
his shirts. In the interim, a dark 
figure rang at Mrs. Rapp’s 
house, two blocks away, and 
went in. Jim paid for his shirts 
and drove home instead. The car 
worked perfectly again. 



nphe servant problem was 
perhaps more urgently dis- 
cussed on the planet Dexter 
than in most suburban commu- 
nities. 

There was no question of fir- 
ing bad servants. They came 
with the house. Though couples 
might graduate to other servants 
and other houses, and were gen- 
erally in due time reassigned to 
another planet (Dexter was 
merely the first stage, or condi- 
tioning-ground, toward future 
assignments in space), they had 
no choice in servants so long as 
they stayed on Dexter. 

Since the matching of servant- 
to-master often seemed not only 
arbitrary, but downright mali- 
cious, this arrangement caused 
much grumbling. 

“I understand the govern- 
ment’s policy of wanting to hire 
the local lower-life forms, and 
thus give us some kind of econ- 
omic welcome,” Jim said. The 
usual servants’-vacation party 
had gathered in his house that 
evening. Barbara had pulled 
herself together sufficiently to 
put on a green wool dress and 
rhinestone earrings. She looked 
attractive, and he was willing, 
now to shunt his wrath onto 
Where it Belonged. “But why, 
for instance, condemn one to a 
Miss Sissing, the New England 
spinster of outer space? Why not 
at least give a choice of evils?”

“You rather have something 
blonde, and ... I know you.” 
Barbara nudged him in the ribs, 
not too gently. 

“My Miss Minnie,” Ellen Seitz 
said, spilling a drink down her 
stout, soft, beflowered self. “Oh, 
dear ,, . Always hurrying, she is. 
She answers the phone, and 
leaves chicken tracks for notes. 
You’d think the government’d 
give them a secretarial course 
before turning them loose on us. 
Such a bother that girl is. She 
makes me nervous.” 

Big Herb Shannon said, “That 
ain’t the worst. Wait’ll your wife 
starts quoting your s as gospel. 
Miss Fallon said do this, Miss 
Fallon said do that. I can’t even 
git in bed with my wife ‘thout 
wonderin’ what Miss Fallon’d 
say.” He chuckled, with the 
deep rich Southern chuckle that 
particularly irritated Jim. It 
seemed rather studied, after 
twenty years on various planets 
far from North Carolina. But 
then, they all had a tendency to 
hang on to irritating little ha- 
bits. Pieces of home, perhaps. 

His wife, Nancy, a plucked 
and haggard Southern belle of 
fifty, with sharp eyes, chewed 
her nails. The Shannons had 
never gotten away from Dexter 
for long. Something always hap- 
pened; Herb took to drink, Nan- 
cy had a bout of nerves. His 
work went poorly. They never 



had children. And back they 
came, time and again. “Oh, you 
hush,” she said to her husband. 
“Ah Miss Fallon’s a jewel an’ 
you know it. But Ah wish she 
could make a shortcake like 
youah Pearl, honey,” she said to 
Edna Ransome. 

“Who also, and I happen to 
know, listens in on my phone 
conversations,” Edna said sharp- 
ly. Her earrings swung wildly as 
she turned. She and Nancy 
Shannon were among the few 
healthy wives on Dexter, having 
both been there long enough to 
adjust; and the only ones, there- 
fore, with enough ragged ner- 
vous energy to be continuously 
in conflict. They enjoyed contra- 
dicting each other. “I don’t 
know how she listens. Sometimes 
she’s rooms away ... I just know 
she does. Like once when George 
called to say he couldn’t be on 
time to drive her to the bus. She 
got herself a ride with Mr. Han- 
son before I’d even told her 
what George said.” 

“The help anywheah have an 
undahgroun’ system of communi- 
cation, honey,” Mrs. Shannon 
said. 

Paul Baniff, the mineralogist, 
sat in the comer half-listening 
to this familiar conversation. 
The only scientist in a group 
composed mostly of minor offi- 
cials and clerks, he regarded his 
present company with some de-

tachment. It was always like 
this, when the servants left. An 
outburst of personalities and 
complaints. But nobody ever 
asked the real questions. 

“No,” he said aloud, suddenly. 
“There is something spooky 
about them. About my Bessie, 
anyway. I’m sure she’s been 
looking into my files. Why, I 
don’t know. It’s mostly routine 
technical reports . but it’s an 
odd thing for a mere servant . 

T T e stopped abruptly, as if 
-*■ invisibly jerked. For a mo- 
ment his eyes looked totally 
blank, then he slowly closed his 
mouth. 

The silence stretched uncom- 
fortably. Then Nancy Shannon 
began chewing her nails; Ellen 
Seitz chewed her eyeglasses; 
Herb Shannon scratched his 
stomach. Barbara surreptiously 
scratched her shoulderblades be- 
neath the green wool dress. Lit- 
tle Mrs. Nugent blinked her 
pink-rimmed eyes, and said: 

“My Ella is simply marvelous 
with the baby.” 

It was almost the only baby on 
the planet, and the silence gave 
her an opportunity to talk about 
it, almost uninterruptedly, for 
fifteen minutes. The others lis- 
tened, occupied with their own 
private tics. Paul Baniff watched 
glumly. “If I tell her the most 
complicated schedule . poor 



baby has feeding and teething 
problems, you know . 

Out in the kitchen, Jim Rich- 
ards and Edna Ransome kissed 
fervently. “Naughty,” she said, 
wiping lipstick off his face. 

Outside, Dexter’s two moons 
swam down to rest below the 
horizon, and the big searchlights 
around the settlement snapped 
on: guardians against the dark 
jungles and waste lands. There 
was nothing very dangerous out 
there. Dexter had no native wild- 
life except plants, some of 
which were poisonous on con- 
tact, but none of which were 
perambulatory or predatory. 
The searchlights merely made 
the inhabitants feel safer at 
night. Distant illuminations, that 
lit the way between houses, or 
between bedrooms and bath- 
rooms, and kept off the night- 
mare possibility of Something 
unexpectedly, stealthily, crossing 
the cleared strip between village 
and wilderness. 

With the night searchlights 
on, now, they felt it safe to go 
home. In a flurry of farewells 
and last drinks, Jim’s and Bar- 
bara’s guests left their cosy 
chairs and went back to bed. 

It would be the Shannon’s 
turn to entertain the next night. 
None of them, except perhaps 
Paul Baniff, the only single man 
and scientist, could quite bear 
that stretch between end-of-work 



102 



GALAXY 



and searchlights-on alone. Or 
even in couples . 

“You didn’t buy enough li- 
quor,” Barbara said when they 
had gone. 

“Hell, yes, I did. You’re the 
one. Forgot to put enough crack- 
ers and stuff.” 

“Didn’t have enough to give 
Paul a third drink, even.” 

“So what? You served the 
same lousy crackers you’ve 
served the last three times. If 
you can’t think of something 
new, get Miss Sissing to think of 
something.” 

‘I can get on all right with- 
out Miss Sissing.” 

“You’re drunk and shut up,” 
he said. 

“I’m not, an’ if you’re so hot 
for Miss Sissing, whyn’t you 
marry her instead? What you 
should’ve married is a servant, 
not a wife . .” 

He hit her; she broke a glass 
throwing it at him. Then she 
cried, and he put her to bed. 

The other marital tiffs and 
conversations died out into 
sleep, throughout the colony. Be- 
neath the vast alien stars, the 
searchlights turned their com- 
forting beams. 

M iss Sissing entered the 
doors of the airlock, where 
she took off her uniform and 
waited. Decompression took time. 
Coming out, she was given a 



notebook, and then went into 
the big inner room where all the 
other servants were already sit- 
ting at desks, scribbling. 

She ran quickly down the re- 
port card, grading from 1 (Ex- 
cellent) to 5 (failing, hesitating 
only occasionally: 

Marital relations 4 
Relationship with others 3 
Follow directions 2 
Uses spare time constructively 
4 — 

Courteous in speech and man- 
ner — with adults 2 with class- 
mates 3 — 

Observes school and group 
rules 3 — 

After some thought, she add- 
ed, under Comments, “Jim’s re- 
lation to the group seems im- 
proved. He can articulate his 
own wants better, and his ability 
to listen to others has deepened. 
He still, however, has difficulty 
with personal relations, and 
takes badly to guidance, even 
from his wife. There is still a 
marked tendency to anti-social 
behavior, and to aggression gen- 
erally. He is careless about his 
work habits, and his homework. 
Jim is basically normal, but for 
the time being we recommend 
that he be given further special 
treatment and that he not be 
promoted to the 1st grade.” 

She put down her pen, closed 
the notebook and then pulled 
her ear thoughtfully and yawned. 



SERVANT PROBLEM 



103 



Neither Miss Sissing’s ear nor 
her mouth went back to shape 
after these gestures. They con- 
tinued to puli and stretch, as did 
the mouths, ears, and faces of the 
other servants around tire room. 
She handed in her report with a 
hand that stretched until it be- 
came a tendril; and, turning to 
Paul Baniff’s servant, who sat 
next to her, let a smile run whol- 
ly around her face until the face 
vanished into a knob topped, 
whimsically, by five eyes; run- 
ning idly through several chang- 
es, as someone tired of holding 
an unnatural position for a long 
time may yawn and stretch. 

“I suppose,” she said, from a 
mouth that had suddenly ap- 
peared from the tip of an an- 
tennae, “that you passed Paul.” 

“Skipped him a grade,” said 
what-had-been Bessie. “He’s get- 
ting too hard to hold. After that 



remark about his desk tonight, I 
recommended that they move 
him tomorrow. When are they 
going to promote you, by the 
by?” 

“I may get 3rd grade next 
time, if I’m lucky,” said a voice 
from what remained of Miss Sis- 
sing’s feet. “I’ve been going to 
night school. Any more of this 
kindergarten, and I’d be playing 
with blocks, too.” 

All around the room, the sit- 
ting shapes stretched, yawned, 
grew, altered, until they each 
nearly reached the top of the 
huge building. Then, single file, 
they walked out of the building 
to the waiting space bus, where 
they were carried off until next 
term to Dexter’s two moons, 
leaving their charges asleep in 
the gentle night-light of the 
search lights.

ILLUSTRATED BY GAUGHAN 



Most religions offer a way to 
heaven. The Vorsters gave a 
promise of going to the stars l 



I 

'"Inhere was chaos in the face of 
the earth, but to the man 
in the Nothing Chamber it did 
not matter. 

Ten billion people — or was 
it twelve billion by now? — 
fought for their place in the sun. 



Skyscrapers shot heavenward 
like sprouting beanstalks. The 
Martians mocked. The Venusians 
spat. Nut-cults flourished, and in 
a thousand cells the Vorsters 
bowed low to their devilish blue 
glow. All of this, at the moment, 
was of no significance to Rey- 
nolds Kirby. He was out of it. 



105 



He was the man in the Nothing 
Chamber 

The place of his repose was 
four thousand feet above the blue 
Caribbean, in his hundredth- 
story apartment on Tortola in 
the Virgin Islands. A man had 
to take his rest somewhere.- Kir- 
by, as a high official in the U.N., 
had the right to warmth and 
slumber, and a substantial chunk 
of his salary covered the over- 
head on his hideaway. The build- 
ing was a tower of shining glass 
whose foundations drove deep 
into the heart of the island. One 
could not build a skyscraper like 
this on every Caribbean island; 
too many of them were flat disks 
of dead coral, lacking the sub- 
stance to support half a million 
tons of dead weight. Tortola was 
different, a retired volcano, a 
submerged mountain. Here they 
could build, and here they had 
built. 

Reynolds Kirby slept the 
good sleep. 

Half an hour in a Nothing 
Chamber restored a man to vita- 
lity, draining the poisons of 
fatigue from his body and mind. 
Three hours in it left him limp, 
flaccid willed. A twenty-four 
hour stint could make any man 
a puppet. Kirby lay in a warm 
nutrient bath, ears plugged, eyes 
capped, feed-lines bringing air to 
his lungs. There was nothing like 
crawling back into the womb for 



a while when the world was too 
much with you. 

The minutes ticked by. Kirby 
did not think of Vorsters. Kirby 
did not think of Nat Weiner, the 
Martian. Kirby did not think of 
the esper girl, writhing in her bed 
of torment, whom he had seen 
in Kyoto last week. 

Kirby did not think. 

A voice purred, “Are you ready, 
Freeman Kirby?” 

Kirby was not ready. Who ever 
was? A man had to be driven 
from his Nothing Chamber by 
an angel with a flaming sword. 
The nutrient bath began to bub- 
ble out of the tank. Rubber- 
cushioned metal fingers peeled 
the caps from his eyeballs. His 
ears were unplugged. Kirby lay 
shivering for a moment, expelled 
from the womb, resisting the re- 
turn to reality. The chamber’s 
cycle was complete; it could not 
be turned on again for twenty- 
four hours, and a good thing, too. 

“Did you sleep well, Freeman 
Kirby?” 

Kirby scowled rustily and 
clambered to his feet. Pie sway- 
ed, nearly lost his balance, but 
the robot servitor was there to 
steady him. Kirby caught a 
burnished arm and held it until 
the spasm passed. 

“I slept marvelously well,” he 
told the metal creature. “It’s a 
pity to return.”

“You don’t mean that, Free- 
man. You know that the only 
true pleasure comes from an en- 
gagement with life. You said that 
to me yourself, Freeman Kirby.” 

“I suppose I did,” Kirby ad- 
mitted drily. All of the robot’s 
pious philosophy stemmed from 
things he had said. He accepted 
a robe from the squat, flat-faced 
thing and pulled it over his 
shoulders. He shivered again. 
Kirby was a lean man, too tall 
for his weight, with stringy, 
corded arms and legs, close-crop- 
ped gray hair, deep-set greenish 
eyes. He was forty, and looked 
fifty, and before climbing into 
the Nothing Chamber today he 
had felt about seventy. 

“When does the Martian ar- 
rive?” he asked. 

“Seventeen hours. He’s at a 
banquet in San Juan right now, 
but he’ll be along soon.” 

“I can’t wait,” Kirby said. 
Moodily he moved to the nearest 
window and depolarized it. He 
looked down, way down, at the 
tranquil water lapping at the 
beach. He could see the dark line 
of the coral reef, green water on 
the hither side, deep blue water 
beyond. The reef was dead, of 
course. The delicate creatures 
who had built it could stand only 
so much motor fuel in their sys- 
tems, and the level of tolerance 
had been passed quite some time 
ago. The skittering hydrofoils 



buzzing from island to island left 
a trail of murderous slime in their 
wake. 

nphe U.N. man closed his eyes. 

And opened them quickly, 
for when he lowered the lids 
there appeared on the screen of 
his brain the sight of that esper 
girl again, twisting, screaming, 
biting her knuckles, yellow skin 
flecked with gleaming beads of 
sweat. And the Vorster man 
standing by, waving that damned 
blue glow around, murmuring, 
“Peace, child, peace, you will 
soon be in harmony with the 
All.” 

That had been last Thursday. 
This was probably the following 
Wednesday. She was in harmony 
with the All by now, Kirby 
thought, and an irreplaceable 
pool of genes had been scattered 
to the four winds. Or the seven 
winds. He was having trouble 
keeping his cliches straight these 
days. 

Seven seas, he thought. Four 
winds. 

The shadow of a copter crossed 
his line of sight. 

“Your guest is arriving,” the 
robot declared. 

“Magnificient,” Kirby said 
sourly. 

The news that the Martian was 
on hand set Kirby jangling with 
tension. He had been selected as 
the guide, mentor, and watchdog 



108 



GALAXY 



for the visitor from the Martian 
colony. A great deal depended 
on maintaining friendly relations 
with the Martians, for they rep- 
resented markets vital to Earth’s 
economy. They also represented 
vigor and drive, commodities 
currently in short supply on 
Earth. 

But they were also a headache 
to handle — touchy, mercurial, 
unpredictable. Kirby knew that 
he had a big job on his hands. 
He had to keep the Martian out 
of harm’s way, coddle him and 
cosset him, all without ever seem- 
ing patronizing or oversolicitous. 
And if Kirby bungled it, well, it 
could be costly to Earth and fatal 
to Kirby’s own career. 

He opaqued the window again 
and hurried into his bedroom to 
change into robes of state. A 
clinging gray tunic, green foul- 
ard, boots of blue leather, gloves 
of gleaming golden mesh — he 
looked every inch the important 
Earthside official by the time the 
annunciator clanged to inform 
him that Nathaniel Weiner of 
Mars had come to call. 

“Show him in,” Kirby said. 

The door irised open and the 
Martian stepped nimbly through. 
He was a small, compact man in 
his early thirties, unnaturally 
wide-shouldered, with thin lips, 
jutting cheekbones, dark beady 
eyes. He looked physically pow- 
erful, as though he had spent his 



life struggling with the killing 
gravity of Jupiter, not romping 
in the airy effortlessness of Mars. 
He was deeply tanned, and a fine 
network of wrinkles radiated 
from the corners of his eyes. He 
looked aggressive, thought Kirby. 
He looked arrogant. 

C 4 TT'reeman Kirby, it’s a pleas- 

-*■ ure to see you,” the Mar- 
tian said in a deep, rasping voice. 

“The honor is mine, Freeman 
Weiner.” 

“Permit me,” Weiner said. He 
drew his laser pistol. Kirby’s ro- 
bot scurried forward with the 
velvet cushion. The Martian 
placed the weapon carefully on 
the plush mound. The robot slid 
across the floor to bring the gun 
to Kirby. 

“Call me Nat,” the Martian 
said. 

Kirby smiled thinly. He picked 
up the gun, resisted the insane 
temptation to ash the Martian on 
the spot, and briefly examined it. 
Then he replaced it on the cush- 
ion and flicked his hand at the 
robot, who carried it back to its 
owner. 

“My friends call me Ron,” Kir- 
by said. “Reynolds is a lousy 
first name.” 

“Glad to know you, Ron. 
What’s to drink?” 

Kirby was jarred by the breach 
of etiquette, but he maintained 
an equitable diplomatic mask. 



BLUE FIRE 



109 



The Martian had been punctil- 
ious enough with his gun-ritual, 
but you’d expect that with any 
frontiersman; it didn’t mean that 
his manners extended beyond 
that. 

Smoothly Kirby said, “What- 
ever you like, Nat. Synthetics, 
realies, you name it and it’s here. 
What about a filtered rum?” 
“I’ve had so much rum I’m 
ready to puke it, Ron. Those 
gabogos in San Juan drink it like 
water. What about some decent 
whiskey?” 

“You dial it,” Kirby said with 
a grand sweep of his hand. The 
robot picked up the console of 
the bar and carried it to the 
Martian. Weiner eyed the but- 
tons a moment and stabbed al- 
most at random, twice. 

“I’m ordering a double rye for 
you,” Weiner announced. “And 
a double bourbon for me.” 
Kirby found that amusing. The 
rude colonial was not only select- 
ing his own drink but one for the 
host. Double rye, indeed! Kirby 
hid his wince and took the drink. 
Weiner slipped comfortably into 
a webfoam cradle. Kirby sat also. 

“How are you enjoying your 
visit to Earth?” Kirby asked. 

“Not bad. Not bad. Sickening 
the way you people are crammed 
together here, though.” 

“It’s the human condition.” 
“Not on Mars it isn’t. Not on 
Venus either.” 



“Give it time,” Kirby said. 

“I doubt it. We know how to 
regulate our population up there, 
Ron.” 

“So do we. It just took us a 
while to get the idea across to 
everybody, and by that time 
there were ten billion of us. We 
hope to keep the rate of increase 
down.” 

C C'\/'ou know what?” Weiner 
* said. “You ought to take 
every tenth person and feed ’em 
to the converters. Get some good 
energy back out of all that meat. 
Cut your population by a billion 
over-night.” He chuckled. “Not 
serious. Wouldn’t be ethical. Just 
a passing joke.” 

Kirby smiled. “You aren’t the 
first to suggest it, Nat. And some 
of the others were serious.” 
“Discipline, that’s the answer 
to every human problem. Dis- 
cipline and more self-discipline. 
Denial. Planning. This whiskey 
is damned good, Ron. How about 
another round?” 

“Help yourself.” 

Weiner did. Generously. 
“Damned fine stuff,” he mur- 
mured. “We don’t get drinks like 
this on Mars. Got to admit it, 
Ron. Crowded and stinking as 
this planet is, it’s got comforts. I 
wouldn’t want to live here, mind 
you, but I’m glad I came. The 
women — mmmm! The drinks! 
The excitement!”

“You’ve been here two days?” 
Kirby asked. 

“That’s right. One night in 
New York, ceremonies, banquet, 
all that garbage, sponsored by 
the Colonial Association. Then 
down to Washington to see the 
President. Nice old chap. Soft 
belly, though. Could stand some 
exercise. Then this idiot thing in 
San Juan, a day of hospitality, 
meeting the Puerto Rican com- 
rades, that kind of junk. And 
now here. What’s to do here, 
Ron?” 

“Well, we could go downstairs 
for a swim, first — ” 

“I can swim all I like on Mars. 
I wan! to see civilization, not wa- 
ter. Complexity.” Weiner’s eyes 
glowed. Kirby abruptly realized 
that the man had been drunk 
when he walked in, and that the 
two stiff jolts of bourbon had 
sent him into a fine glow of in- 
toxication. “You know what I 
want to do, Kirby? I want to get 
out and grub in the dirt a little. 
I want to go to opium dens. I 
want to see espers have ecstasies. 
I want to take in a Vorster ses- 
sion. I want to live the life, Ron. 
I want to experience Earth — 
muck and all!” 

II 

^T^he Vorster hall was in a 
shabby, almost intolerably 
seedy old building in central 



Manhattan, practically within 
spitting distance of the U.N. 
buildings. Kirby felt queasy 
about entering it; he had never 
really conquered his uneasiness 
about slumming, even now when 
most of the world was one vast 
teeming slum. But Nat Weiner 
had commanded it, and so it 
must be. Kirby had brought him 
here because it was the only 
Vorster place he had visited be- 
fore, and so he didn’t feel too 
sharply out of place. 

The cult was an important new 
force in Earthly affairs, Kirby 
knew — though he didn’t know 
much more than that. Any 
religious or quasi-religious move- 
ment that could grow so swiftly 
had to be important. In a world 
increasingly fragmented and 
chaotic, the Vorsters obviously 
had something. 

The sign over the door said in 
glowing but splotchy letters; 

BROTHERHOOD OF THE 

IMMANENT RADIANCE 
ALL WELCOME 
SERVICES DAILY 
HEAL YOUR HEARTS 
HARMONIZE WITH

Weiner snickered at the sign. 
“Look at that! Heal your hearts! 
How’s your heart, Kirby?” 

“Punctured in several places. 
Shall we go in?”

“You bet we shall,” Weiner 
said. 

The Martian was sloshingly 
drunk. He held his liquor well, 
Kirby had to admit. Through the 
long evening Kirby had not even 
tried to match the colonial envoy 
drink for drink, and yet he felt 
hazy and overheated. The tip of 
his nose prickled. He yearned to 
shake Weiner off and crawl back 
into the Nothing Chamber to get 
all this poison out of his system. 

But Weiner wanted to kick 
over the traces, and it was hard 
to blame him for that. Mars was 
a rough place, where there was 
no time for self-indulgence. Ter- 
raforming a planet took a maxi- 
mum effort. The job was nearly 
done, now, after two generations 
of toil, and the air of Mars was 
sweet and clean, but no one was 
relaxing up there yet. Weiner 
was here to negotiate a trade 
agreement, but it was also his 
first chance to escape from the 
rigors of Martian life. The Spar- 
ta of space, they called it. And 
here he was in Athens. 

They entered the Vorster hall. 

I t was long and narrow, an ob- 
long box of a room. A dozen 
rows of unpainted wooden 
benches ran from wall to wall, 
with a narrow aisle down one 
side. At the rear was the altar, 
glowing with the inevitable blue 
radiance. Behind it stood a tall, 



skeleton-thin man, bald, beard- 
ed. 

“Is that the priest?” Weiner 
whispered harshly. 

“I don’t think they’re called 
priests,” said Kirby. “But he’s in 
charge.” 

“Do we take communion?” 
“Let’s just watch,” Kirby sug- 
gested. 

“Look at all these damn man- 
iacs,” the Martian said. 

“This is a very popular reli- 
gious movement.” 

“I don’t get it.” 

“Watch. Listen.” 

“Down on their knees — grovel- 
ling to that half-pint reactor — ” 
Heads were turning in their 
direction. Kirby sighed. He had 
no love for the Vorsters or their 
religion himself, but he was em- 
barrassed at this boisterous des- 
ecration of their shrine. Most 
undiplomatically, he took Wein- 
er’s arm, guided the Martian in- 
to the nearest pew, and pulled 
him down into a kneeling posi- 
tion. Kirby knelt beside him. The 
Martian gave him an ugly 
glance. Colonists didn’t like their 
bodies handled by strangers. A 
Venusian might have slashed at 
Kirby with his dagger for some- 
thing like that. But, then, a 
Venusian wouldn’t be here on 
Earth at all, let alone cutting 
capers in a Vorster hall. 

Suddenly, Weiner grabbed the 
rail and leaned forward to watch 



112

the service. Kirby squinted 
through the near darkness at the 
man behind the altar. 

The reactor was on, and glow- 
ing — a cube of Cobalt-60, shield- 
ed by water, the dangerous ra- 
diations gobbled up before they 
could sear through flesh. In the 
darkness Kirby saw a faint blue 
glow, rising slowly in brightness, 
growing more intense. Now the 
lattice of the tiny reactor was 
masked in whitish-blue light, and 
around it swirled a weird green- 
ish-blue glow that seemed almost 
purple at its core. It was the 
Blue Fire, the eerie cold light of 
the Cerenkov radiation, spread- 
ing outward to envelop the entire 
room. 

I t was nothing mystical, Kirby 
knew. Electrons were surging 
through that tank of water, mov- 
ing at a velocity greater than 
light in that medium, and as they 
moved they hurled forth a stream 
of photons. There were neat 
equations to explain the source 
of the Blue Fire. Give the Vorst- 
ers credit: they didn’t say it was 
anything supernatural. But it 
made a useful symbolic instru- 
ment, a focus for religious emo- 
tions, more colorful than a cruci- 
fix, more dramatic than the tables 
of the Law. 

The Vorster up front said 
quietly, “There is a Oneness from 
which all life stems. The infinite 



variety of the universe we owe 
to the motion of the electrons. 
Atoms meet; their particles en- 
twine. Electrons leap from orbit 
to orbit and chemical changes are 
worked.” 

“Listen to the pious bastard,” 
Weiner snorted. “A chemistry 
lecture, yet!” 

Kirby bit his lip in anguish. A 
girl in the pew just in front of 
theirs turned round and said in 
a low, urgent voice, “Please. 
Please — just listen.” 

She was such a numbing sight 
that even Weiner was struck 
dumb for once. The Martian 
gasped in shock. Kirby, who 
had seen surgically altered wom- 
en before, scarcely reacted at all. 
Iridescent cups covered the 
openings where her ears had 
been. An opal was mounted in 
the bone of her forehead. Her 
eyelids were of gleaming foil. 
The surgeons had done things to 
her nostrils, to her lips. Perhaps 
she had been in some terrible ac- 
cident. More likely she had had 
herself maimed for cosmetic pur- 
poses. Madness. Madness. 

The Vorster said, “The energy 
of the sun — the green life surg- 
ing in plants — the bursting 
wonder of growth — for this we 
thank the electron. The enzymes 
of our body — the sparking 
synapses of our brains — the 
beating of our hearts — for this 
we thank the electron. Fuel and

food, light and heat, warmth and 
nourishment, everything and all, 
rising from the Oneness, rising 
from the Immanent Radiance — ” 
The thought stunned him. 
How had it stolen upon him? 
This was no religion. This was 
cultism, a wildfire movement, the 
latest fad, here today, gone to- 
morrow. Ten million converts 
overnight? What of it? Tomorrow 
or the next day would come the 
newest prophet, exhorting the 
faithful to plunge their hands 
into a scintillation counter’s 
sparkling bath, and the Vorster 
halls would be deserted. This was 
no rock. This was quicksand. 

And yet there had been that 
momentary pull — 

Kirby tightened his lips. It 
was the strain, he thought, of 
shepherding this wild Martian 
around all evening. He didn’t 
give a damn for the supernal 
Oneness. The underlying unity of 
all things meant nothing to him. 
This was a place for the tired, 
the neurotic, the novelty-hungry, 
for the kind of person who would 
cheerfully pay good money to 
have her ears cut off and her nos- 
trils slit. It was a measure of his 
own desperation that he had been 
almost ready to join the com- 
municants at the altar. 

He relaxed. 

And in the same moment Nat 
Weiner burst to his feet and went 
careening down the aisle. 



“Save me!” the Martian cried. 
“Heal my goddam soul! Show me 
the Oneness!” 

( 4 T7" neel with us, brother,” the 
A ®Worster leader said equa- 
bly. 

“I’m a sinner!” Weiner howled. 
“I’m full of booze and corrup- 
tion! I got to be saved! I embrace 
the electron! I yield!” 

Kirby hurried after him down 
the aisle. Was Weiner serious? 
The Martians were notorious for 
their resistance to any and all 
religious movements, including 
the established and legitimate 
ones. Had he somehow suc- 
cumbed to that hellish blue glow? 

“Take the hands of your breth- 
ren,” the leader murmured. “Bow 
your head and let the glow en- 
fold you.” 

Weiner looked to his left. The 
girl with the surgical alterations 
knelt beside him. She held out 
her hand. Four fingers of flesh, 
one of some turquoise-hued 
metal. 

“It’s a monster!” Weiner 
shrieked. “Take it away! I won’t 
let you cut me up!” 

“Be calm, brother — ” 

“You’re a bunch of phonies! 
Phonies! Phonies! Phonies! Noth- 
ing but a pack of — ” 

Kirby got to him. He dug his 
fingertips into the ridged muscles 
of Weiner’s back in a way that 
the Martian was likely to notice. 



114 



GALAXY 



In a low, intense voice Kirby 
said, “Let’s go, Nat We’re get- 
ting out of here.” 

“Take your stinking hands off 
me, Earther!” 

“Nat, please — this is a house 
of worship) — ” 

“This is a bughouse! Crazy! 
Crazy! Crazy! Look at them! 
Down on their knees like stink- 
ing maniacs!” Weiner struggled 
to his feet. His booming voice 
seemed to batter at the walls. 
“I’m a free man from Mars! I 
dug in the desert with these 
hands! I watched the oceans fill! 
What did any of you do? You 
cut your eyelids off and wallow- 
ed in muck! And you — you fake 
priest, you take their money and 
love it!” 

The Martian grabbed the altar 
rail and vaulted over it, coming 
perilously close to the glowing 
reactor. He clawed at the tower- 
ing, bearded Vorster. 

Calmly the cultist reached out 
and slipped one long arm through 
the pinwheeling chaos of Wein- 
er’s threshing limbs. He touched 
his fingertips to the Martian’s 
throat for a fraction of a second. 

Weiner fell like a dead man. 

Ill 

( £ it re you all right now?” Kir- 
by asked, dry-throated. 

Weiner stirred. “Where’s that 
girl?” 



“The one with the surgery?” 
“No,” he rasped. “The esper. I 
want her near me again.” 

Kirby glanced at the slender, 
blue-haired girl. She nodded 
tensely and took Weiner’s hand. 
The Martian’s face was bright 
with sweat and his eyes were 
still wild. He lay back, head 
propped on pillows, cheeks hol- 
low. 

They were in a sniffer palace 
across the street from the Vorster 
hall. Kirby had had to carry the 
Martian out of the place himself, 
slung across his shoulders; the 
Vorsters did not let robots in. 
The sniffer palace seemed like as 
good a place as any to take him. 

The esper girl had come over 
to them as Kirby staggered into 
the place. She was a Vorster too 
— the blue hair was the tip-off — 
but apparently she had finished 
her worship for the day, and was 
topping things off with a quick 
inhalation. With instant sym- 
pathy she had bent to peer at 
Weiner’s flushed, sweat-flecked 
face. She had asked Kirby if his 
friend had had a stroke. 

“I’m not sure what happened 
to him,” Kirby said. “He was 
drunk and began trouble in the 
Vorster place. The leader of the 
service touched his throat.” 

The girl smiled. She was waif- 
like, fragile, no more than eigh- 
teen, nineteen. Cursed with tal- 
ent. She closed her eyes, took 



BLUE FIRE

Weiner’s hand, clutched the thick 
wrist until the Martian revived. 
Kirby did not know what she 
had done. All this was mystery to 
him. 

Now, strength flowing back in- 
to him visibly from moment to 
moment, Weiner tried to sit up. 
He seized the girl’s hand and held 
it. She did not attempt to break 
free. 

He said, “What did they hit 
me with?” 

“It was a momentary altera- 
tion of your charge,” the girl 
told him. “He turned off your 
heart and brain for a thousandth 
of a second. There will be no per- 
manent damage.” 

( 4 it T ow’d he do it? He just 

-*■ touched me with his fin- 
gers.” 

“There is a technique. But 
you’ll be all right.” 

Weiner eyed the girl. “You an 
esper? You reading my mind 
right now?” 

“I’m an esper, but I don’t read 
minds. I’m just an empath. 
You’re all churned up with ha- 
tred. Why don’t you go back 
across the street? Ask him to for- 
give you. I know he will. Let him 
teach you. Have you read Vorst’s 
book?” 

“Why don’t you just go to 
hell?” Weiner said casually. “No, 
don’t. You’re too cute. We got 
some cute espers on Mars, too. 



You want some fun tonight? My 
name’s Nat Weiner, and this is 
my friend, Ron Kirby. Reynolds 
Kirby. He’s a stuffed shirt, but 
we can give him the slip.” The 
Martian’s grip on the slender arm 
grew tighter. “What do you say?” 

The girl didn’t say anything. 
She simply frowned, and Weiner 
made a strange face and released 
her arm. Kirby, watching, had 
to repress a grin. Weiner was run- 
ning into trouble all over the 
place. This was a complicated 
world. 

“Go across the street,” the girl 
whispered. “They’ll help you 
there.” 

She turned without waiting for 
a reply, and faded into the dim- 
ness. Weiner passed a hand over 
his forehead as though brushing 
cobwebs from his brain. He strug- 
gled to his feet, ignoring Kirby’s 
proffered arm. 

“What kind of place is this?” 
he asked. 

“A sniffer palace.” 

“Will they preach to me here?” 

“They’ll just fog your brain a 
little,” said Kirby. “Want to try?” 

“Sure. I told you I wanted to 
try everything. I don’t get a 
chance to come to Earth every 
day.” 

Weiner grinned, but it was a 
somber grin. He didn’t seem to 
have the bounce he had had an 
hour ago. Of course, getting 
knocked out by the Vorster had 



116 



GALAXY 




sobered him some. He was still 
game, though, ready to soak up 
all the sins this wicked planet had 
to offer. 

'IT' irby wondered whether he 
was making as big a mess of 
this assignment as it seemed. 
There was no way of knowing — 
not yet. Later, of course, Weiner 
might well protest the handling 
he had received, and Kirby might 
find himself abruptly transferred 
to less sensitive duties in the fu- 
ture. That was not a pleasant 
thought. He regarded his career 
as an important matter, perhaps 
the only important matter in his 
life. He did no want to wreck it 
in a night. 



They moved toward the sniffer 
booth. 

“Tell me,” Weiner said. “Do 
those people really believe all 
that crap about the electron?” 

“I really don’t know. I haven’t 
made a study of it, Nat.” 

“You’ve watched the move- 
ment appear. How many mem- 
bers does it have now?” 

“A couple of million, I guess.” 
“That’s plenty. We only have 
seven million people on all of 
Mars. If you’ve got this many 
joining this nutty cult — ” 

“There are lots of new religious 
sects on Earth today,” Kirby 
said. “It’s an apocalyptic time. 
People are hungry for reassur- 
ance. They feel the Earth’s being 



BLUE FIRE 



117 



left behind by the stream of 
events. So they look for a unity, 
for some way out of all the con- 
fusion and fragmentation.” 

“Let them come to Mars if they 
want a unity. We got work for 
everybody, and no time to stew 
about the allness of it all.” Weiner 
guffawed. “The hell with it. Tell 
me about this sniffer stuff.” 

“Opium’s out of fashion. We 
inhale the more exotic mercap- 
tans. The hallucinations are said 
to be entertaining.” 

“Said to be? Don’t you know? 
Kirby, don’t you have first-hand 
information about anything? You 
aren’t even alive. You’re just a 
zombie. A man needs some vices, 
Kirby.” 

The U.N. man thought of the 
Nothing Chamber waiting for him 
in the lofty tower on balmy Tor- 
tola. His face was a stony mask. 
He said, “Some of us are too 
busy for vices. But this visit of 
yours is likely to be a great edu- 
cation for me, Nat. Have a sniff.” 

A robot rolled up to them. Kir- 
by clapped his right thumb 
against the lambent yellow plate 
set in the robot’s chest. The light 
brightened as Kirby’s print-pat- 
tern was recorded. 

“WeTi bill your Central,” the 
robot said. Its voice was absurdly 
deep: pitch-troubles on the mas- 
ter tape, Kirby suspected. When 
the metal creature rolled away, 
it was listing a bit to starboard. 

118 



Rusty in the gut, he figured. An 
even chance that he wouldn’t be 
billed. 

T T e picked up a sniffer mask 
and handed it to Weiner, 
who sprawled out comfortably on 
the couch along the wall of the 
booth. Weiner donned it. Kirby 
took the other mask and slipped 
it over his nose and mouth. He 
closed his eyes and settled into 
the webfoam cradle near the 
booth’s entrance. A moment 
passed; then he tasted the gas 
creeping into his nasal passages. 
It was a revolting sour-sweet 
smell, a sulphuric smell. 

Kirby waited for the hallucina- 
tion. 

There were people who spent 
hours each day in these booths, 
he knew. The government kept 
raising the tax to discourage the 
sniffers, but they came anyway, 
even at ten, twenty, thirty dol- 
lars a sniff. The gas itself wasn’t 
addictive, not in the metabolic 
way that heroin got to you. It 
was more of a psychological ad- 
diction, something you could 
break if you really tried, but 
which nobody cared to try to 
break: like the sex addiction, 
like mild alcoholism. For some 
it was a kind of religion. Every- 
one to his own creed; this was a 
crowded world, harboring many 
beliefs. 

A girl made of diamonds and 

GALAXY 



emeralds was walking through 
Kirby’s brain. 

The surgeons had cut away 
every scrap of living flesh on her 
body. Her eyeballs had the cold 
glitter of precious gems; her 
breasts were globes of white onyx 
tipped with ruby; her lips were 
slabs of alabaster; her hair was 
fashioned from strings of yellow 
gold. Blue fire flickered around 
her, Vorster fire, crackling 
strangely. 

She said, “You’re tired, Ron. 
You need to get away from your- 
self.” 

“I know. I’m using the Noth- 
ing Chamber every other day, 
now. I’m fighting off a crackup.” 

“You’re too rigid, that’s your 
trouble. Why don’t you visit my 
surgeon? Have yourself changed. 
Get rid of all that stupid meat. 
For this I say, that flesh and 
blood cannot inherit the kingdom 
of God; neither doth corruption 
inherit incorruption.” 

“No,” Kirby muttered. “It isn’t 
so. All I need is some rest. A good 
swim, sunshine, decent amount of 
sleep. But they dumped that mad 
Martian on me.” 

f | ''he hallucination laughed 
shrilly, rippled her arms, per- 
formed a sinuous convolution. 
They had sliced away fingers and 
replaced them with spikes of 
ivory. Her fingernails were of 
polished copper. The mischievous 



tongue that flicked out from be- 
tween the alabaster lips was a 
serpent of gaudy flexiplast. “Be- 
hold,” she crooned voluptuously, 
“I show you a mystery. We shall 
not all sleep, but we shall all be 
changed.” 

“In a moment,” Kirby said. “In 
the twinkling of an eye. The 
trumpet shall sound.” 

“And the dead shall be raised 
incorruptible. Do it, Ron. You’ll 
look so much more handsome. 
Maybe you can hold the next 
marriage together a little better, 
too. You miss her, admit it. You 
ought to see what she looks like 
now. Full fathom five thy loved 
one lies. But she’s happy. For this 
corruptible one must put on in- 
corruption, and this mortal must 
put on immortality.” 

“I’m a human being,” Kirby 
protested. “I’m not going to turn 
myself into a walking museum 
piece like you. Or like her, for 
that matter. Even if it’s becom- 
ing fashionable for men to have 
it done.” 

The blue glow began to pulse 
and throb around the vision in his 
brain. “You need something, 
Ron. The Nothing Chamber isn’t 
the answer. It’s — nothing. Affil- 
iate yourself. Belong. Work isn’t 
the answer either. Join. Join. You 
won’t carve yourself? All right, 
become a Vorster. then. Surren- 
der to the Oneness. Let death be 
swallowed up in victory.” 



BLUE FIRE 



119 



“Can’t I just remain myself?” 
Kirby cried. 

“What you are isn’t enough. 
Not now. Not any more. These 
are hard times. A troubled world. 
The Martians make fun of us. 
The Venusians despise us. We 
need new organization, new 
strength. The sting of death is in 
sin, and the strength of sin is the 
law. Grave, where is thy vic- 
tory?” 

A riotous swirl of colors danced 
through Kirby’s mind. The sur- 
gically altered woman pirouet- 
ted, leaped and bobbed, flaunted 
the jewel-bedecked flamboyance 
of herself in his face. Kirby quiv- 
ered. He clawed fitfully at the 
mask. For this nightmare he had 
paid good money? How could 
people let themselves become ad- 
dicts of this sort of thing — this 
tour through the swamps of one’s 
own mind? 

Kirby wrenched the sniffer 
mask away and threw it to the 
floor of the booth. He sucked 
clean air into his lungs, fluttered 
his eyes, returned to reality. 

He was alone in the booth. 

The Martian Weiner was gone. 

IV 

r T''he robot who ran the sniffer 
palace was of no help. 

“Where’d he go?” Kirby de- 
manded. 

“He left,” came the rusty re- 



ply. “Eighteen dollars sixty cents. 
We will bill your Central.” 

“Did he say where he was go- 
ing?” 

“We did not converse. He left. 
Awwwik! We did not converse. 
I will bill your Central. 
Awwwik!” 

Sputtering a curse, Kirby 
rushed out into the street. He 
glanced involuntarily at the sky. 
Against the darkness he saw the 
lemon-colored letters of the time- 
glow streaming in the firmament, 
irregularly splotched with red : 

2205 HOURS

Two hours to midnight. Plenty 
of time for that lunatic colonial 
to get himself in trouble. The last 
thing Kirby wanted was to have 
a drunken, perhaps hallucinated 
Weiner rampaging around in 
New York. This assignment 
hadn’t entirely been one of ren- 
dering hospitality. Part of Kir- 
by’s job was to keep an eye on 
Weiner. Martians had come to 
Earth before. The libertarian so- 
ciety was a heady wine for them. 

Where had he gone? 

One place to look was the 
Vorster hall. Maybe Weiner had 
gone back to raise some more 
hell over there. With sweat burst- 



120 



GALAXY 



ing from every pore Kirby spir- 
ited across the street, dodging 
the rocketing teardrops as they 
turbined past, and rushed into 
the shabby cultist chapel. The 
service was still going on. It 
didn’t seem as though Weiner 
were there, though. Everyone 
obediently knelt in his pew, and 
there were no shouts, no screams 
of boozy laughter. Kirby silently 
loped down the aisle, checking 
every bench. No Weiner. 

The girl with the surgical face 
was still there, and she smiled 
and stretched a hand toward him. 
For one bizarre moment Kirby 
was catapulted back into his 
sniffer hallucination, and his flesh 
crawled. Then he recovered him- 
self. He managed a faint smile to 
be polite, and got out of the Vor- 
ster place as fast as he could. 

He caught the sidewalk and let 
it carry him three blocks in a 
random direction. No Weiner, 
Kirby got off and found himself 
in front of a public Nothing 
Chamber place, where for twen- 
ty bucks an hour you could get 
wafted off to luscious oblivion. 
Perhaps Weiner had wandered in 
there, eager to try every mind- 
sapping diversion the city had to 
offer. Kirby went in. 

T> obots weren’t in charge here. 

A genuine flesh-and-blood 
entrepreneur came forward, a 
four-hundred-pounder, opulent 



with chins. Small eyes buried in 
fat regarded Kirby doubtfully. 
“Want an hour of rest, friend?” 
“I’m looking for a Martian,” 
Kirby blurted. “About so high, 
big shoulders, sharp cheekbones.” 
“Haven’t seen him.” 

“Look, maybe he’s in one of 
your tanks. This is important. 
It’s U.N. business.” 

“I don’t care if it’s the business 
of God Almighty. I haven’t seen 
him.” The fat man glanced only 
briefly at Kirby’s identification 
plaque. ,r What do you want me 
to do, open my tanks for you? 
He didn’t come in here.” 

“If he does, don’t let him rent 
a chamber,” Kirby begged. “Stall 
him and phone U.N. Security 
right away.” 

“I got to rent him if he wants. 
We run a public hall here, buddy. 
You want to get me in trouble? 
Look, you’re all worked up. Why 
don’t you climb into a tank for 
a little while? It’ll do wonders for 
you. You’ll feel like — ” 

Kirby wheeled and ran out. 
There was nausea in the pit of 
his stomach, perhaps induced by 
the hallucinogen. There was also 
fright, and a goodly jolt of anger. 
He visualized Weiner clubbed in 
some dark alley, his stocky body 
expertly vivisected for the boot- 
leg organ banks. A worthy fate, 
perhaps, but it would raise hob 
with Kirby’s reliability rating. 
More likely was it that Weiner, 



BLUE FIRE 



121 



bashing around like a Chinese 
bull — was that the right simile, 
Kirby wondered? — would stir up 
some kind of mess that would be 
blasphemously difficult to clean 
up. 

Kirby had no idea where to 
look. A communibooth presented 
itself on the corner of the next 
street, and he jumped in, opaqu- 
ing the screens. He rammed his 
identification plaque into the 
slot and punched for U.N. Secur- 
ity. 

The cloudy little screen grew 
clear. The pudgy, bearded face of 
Lloyd Ridblom appeared. 

“Night squad,” Ridblom said. 
“Hello, Ron. Where’s your Mar- 
tian?” 

“Lost him. He gave me the 
slip in a sniffer palace.” 

Ridblom became instantly an- 
imated. “Want me to slap a tele- 
vector on him?” 

tiTVTot yet,” Kirby said. “I’d 
^ ^ rather he didn’t know we 
were upset about his disappear- 
ance. Put the vector on me, in- 
stead, and keep contact. And 
open up a routine net for him. If 
he shows, notify me right away. 
I’ll call back in an hour to change 
the instructions if nothing’s hap- 
pened by then.” 

“Maybe he’s been kidnapped 
by Vorsters,” Ridblom suggested. 
“They’re draining his blood for 
altar wine.” 



“Go to hell,” Kirby said. He 
stepped out of the booth and put 
his thumbs briefly to his eye- 
balls. Slowly, purposelessly, he 
strolled toward the slidewalk and 
let it take him back to the Vor- 
ster hall. A few people were 
coming out of it, now. There was 
the girl with the iridescent ear- 
shells; she wasn’t content to 
haunt his hallucinations, she had 
to keep intersecting his path in 
real life too. 

“Hello,” she said. Her voice 
was gentle, at least. “I’m Vanna 
Marshak. Where’s your friend?” 

“I’m wondering that myself. 
He vanished a little while ago.” 

“Are you supposed to be in 
charge of him?” 

“I’m supposed to be watching 
him, at least. He’s a Martian, 
you know.” 

“I didn’t. He’s certainly hostile 
to the Brotherhood, isn’t he? 
That was sad, the way he erupt- 
ed during the service. He must 
be terribly ill.” 

“Terribly drunk,” Kirby said. 
“It happens to all the Martians 
that come here. The iron bars are 
lifted for them, and they think 
anything goes. Can I buy you a 
drink?” he added mechanically. 

“I don’t drink, thanks. But I’ll 
accompany you if you want one.” 

“I don’t want one. I need 
one.” 

“You haven’t told me your 
name.”

“Ron Kirby. I’m with the U.N. 
I’m a minor bureaucrat. No, I’ll 
correct that: a major bureaucrat 
who gets paid like a minor one. 
We can go in here.” 

He nudged the doorstud of a 
bar on the corner. The sphincter 
whickered open and admitted 
them. She smiled warmly. She 
was about thirty, Kirby guessed. 
Hard to tell, with all that hard- 
ware where the face used to be. 
“Filtered rum,” he said. 

V anna Marshak leaned close 
to him. She wore some 
subtle and unfamiliar perfume. 
“Why did you bring him to the 
Brotherhood house?” she asked. 
He downed his drink as though 



it were fruit juice. “He wanted 
to see what the Vorsters were 
like. So I took him.” 

“I take it you’re unsympathet- 
ic personally?” 

“I don’t have any real opinion. 
I’ve been too busy to pay much 
attention.” 

“That’s not true,” she said 
easily. “You think it’s a nutcult, 
don’t you?” 

Kirby ordered a second drink. 
“All right,” he admitted. “I do. 
It’s a shallow opinion based on 
no real information at all.” 

“You haven’t read Vorst’s 
book?” 

“No.” 

“If I give you a copy, will you 
read it?” 



BLUE FIRE

“Imagine,” he said. “A prose- 
lyte with a heart of gold.” He 
laughed He was feeling drunk 
again. 

“That isn’t really very funny,” 
she said. “You’re hostile to sur- 
gical alterations too, aren’t you?” 
“My wife had a complete face- 
job done. While she was still my 
wife. I got so angry about it that 
she left me. Three years ago. 
She’s dead, now. She and her 
lover went down in a rocket crash 
off New Zealand.” 

“I’m terribly sorry,” Vanna 
Marshak said. “But I wouldn’t 
have had this done to myself if 
I had known about Vorst then. I 
was uncertain. Insecure. Today 
I know where I’m heading — but 
it’s too late to have my real face 
back. It’s rather attractive, I 
think, anyway.” 

“Lovely,” Kirby said. “Tell me 
about Vorst.” 

“It’s very simple. He wants to 
restore spiritual values in the 
world. He wants us all to become 
aware of our common nature and 
our higher goals.” 

“Which we can express by 
watching Cerenkov radiation in 
rundown lofts,” Kirby said. 

“The Blue Fire’s just trim- 
ming. It’s the inner message that 
counts. Vorst wants to see man- 
kind go to the stars. He wants 
us to get out of our muddle and 
confusion and begin to mine our 
real talents. He wants to save the 



espers who are going insane every 
day, harness them, put them to- 
gether to work for the next great 
step in human progress.” 

“I see,” said Kirby gravely. 
“Which is?” 

ttT told you. Going to the stars. 

-S. You think we can stop with 
Mars and Venus? There are mil- 
lions of planets out there. Wait- 
ing for man to find a way to 
reach them. Vorst thinks he 
knows that way. But it calls for 
a union of mental energies, a 
blending, a — oh, I know this 
sounds mystical. But he’s got 
something. And it heals the 
troubled soul, too. That’s the 
short-range purpose: the com- 
munion, the binding-up of 
wounds. And the long-range goal 
is getting to the stars. Of course, 
we’ve got to overcome the fric- 
tions between the planets — get 
the Martians to be more tolerant, 
and then somehow re-establish 
contact with the people on 
Venus, if there’s anything human 
still left in them — do you see that 
there are possibilities here, that 
it isn’t mumbo- jumbo and 
fraud?” 

Kirby didn’t see anything of 
the kind. It sounded hazy and in- 
coherent to him. Vanna Marshak 
had a soft, persuasive voice, and 
there was an earnestness about 
her that made her appealing. He 
could even forgive her for what 



124 



GALAXY 



she had let the knife-wielders do 
to her face. But when it comes 
to Vorst — 

The communicator in his 
pocket bleeped. It was a signal 
from Ridblom, and it meant call 
'die office right away. Kirby got 
to his feet. 

“Excuse me a minute,” he said. 
“Something important to tend 
to—” 

He lurched across the barroom, 
caught himself, took a deep 
breath and got into the booth. 
Into the slot went the plaque; 
trembling fingers punched out 
the number. 

Ridblom appeared on the 
screen again. 

“We’ve found your boy,” the 
pudgy Security man announced 
blandly. 

“Dead or alive?” 

“Alive, unfortunately. He’s in 
Chicago. He stopped off at the 
Martian Consulate, borrowed a 
thousand dollars from the con- 
sul’s wife, and tried to rape her 
in the bargain. She got rid of him 
and called the police, and they 
called me. We have a five-man 
tracer on him now. He’s heading 
for a Vorster cell on Michigan 
Boulevard, and he’s drunk as a 
lord. Should we intercept him?” 

T7"irby bit his lip in anguish. 

*■- “No. No. He’s got immunity, 
anyway. Let me handle. Is there 
a chopper in the U.N. port?” 



“Sure. But it’ll take you at 
least forty minutes to get to Chi, 
and — ” 

“That’s plenty of time. Here’s 
what I want you to do: get hold 
of the prettiest esper you can 
find in Chicago, maybe an em- 
path, some sexy kid, Oriental if 
possible, something like that one 
who had the burnout in Kyoto 
last week. Plunk her down be- 
tween Weiner and that Vorster 
place and turn her loose on him. 
Have her charm him into sub- 
mission. Have her stall him in 
any way possible until I can get 
there, and if she has to part with 
her honor in the process, tell her 
we’ll give her a good price for it. 
If you can’t find an esper get 
hold of a persuasive police- 
woman, or something.” 

“I don’t see why this is really 
necessary,” Ridblom said. “The 
Vorsters can look out for them- 
selves. I understand they’ve got 
some mysterious way of knock- 
ing a troublemaker out so that 
he doesn’t — ” 

“I know, Lloyd. But Weiner’s 
already been knocked out once 
this evening. For all I know, a 
second jolt of the same stuff to- 
night might kill him. That would 
be very awkward all around. Just 
head him off.” 

Ridblom shrugged. “Thy will 
be done.” 

Kirby left the booth. He was 
cold sober again. Vanna Marshak 



BLUE FIRE

was sitting at the bar where he 
had left her. At this distance, 
and in this light, there was some- 
thing almost pretty about her ar- 
tificial disfigurements. 

She smiled. “Well?” 

“They found him. He got to 
Chicago somehow and he’s about 
to raise some hell in the Vorster 
chapel there. I’ve got to go and 
lasso him.” 

“Be gentle with him, Ron. He’s 
a troubled man. He needs help.” 

“Don’t we all?” Kirby blinked 
suddenly. The thought of making 
the trip to Chicago alone struck 
him abruptly as being nasty. 
“Vanna?” he asked. 

“Yes?” 

“Are you going to be busy for 
the next couple of hours?” 

V 

r T~'he copter hovered over Chi- 
cago’s sparkling gaiety. Be- 
low, Kirby saw the bright sheen 
of Lake Michigan, and the splen- 
did mile-high towers that lined 
the lake. Above him blazed the 
local timeglow in chartreue: 

2331 HOURS 

CENTRAL STANDARD TIME 
Wednesday May 8 2077 
OGLEBAY REALTY— 
THE FINEST! 

“Put her down,” Kirby or- 
dered. 



The robopilot steered the cop- 
ter toward a landing. It was im- 
possible, of course, to risk the 
fierce wind currents in those deep 
canyons; they would have to land 
at a rooftop heliport. The landing 
was smooth. Kirby and Vanna 
rushed out. She had given him 
the Vorster message all the way 
from Manhattan, and at this 
point Kirby wasn’t sure whether 
the cult was complete nonsense 
or some sinister conspiracy 
against the general welfare or a 
truly profound spiritually uplift- 
ing creed, or perhaps a bit of all 
three. 

He thought he had the general 
idea. Vorst had cobbled together 
an eclectic religion, borrowing the 
confessional from Catholicism, 
absorbing some of the atheism 
of ur-Buddhism, adding a dose 
of Hindu reincarnation, and lard- 
ing everything over with ultra- 
modernistic trappings, nuclear 
reactors at every altar and plenty 
of gabble about the holy elec- 
tron. But there was also talk of 
harnessing the minds of espers 
to power a stardrive, of a com- 
munion even of non-esper minds, 
and — most startling of all, the 
big selling point — personal im- 
mortality, not reincarnation, not 
the hope of Nirvana, but eternal 
life in the here and now present 
flesh. In view of Earth’s popula- 
tion problems, immortality was 
low on any sane man’s priority 



126 



GALAXY 



list. Immortality for other people, 
anyway; one was always willing 
to consider the extension of one’s 
own life, wasn’t one? Vorst 
preached the eternal life of the 
body, and the people were buy- 
ing. In eight years, the cult had 
gone from one cell to a thousand, 
from fifty followers to millions. 
The old religions were bankrupt. 
Vorst was handing out shining 
gold pieces, and if they were only 
fool’s gold it would take a while 
for the faithful to find that out. 

The copter touched down. 

“Come on,” Kirby said. “There 
isn’t much time.” 

H e scrambled down the exit 
ramp, turning to take Vanna 
Marshak’s hand and help her the 
last few steps. They hurried 
across the rooftop landing area 
to the gravshaft, stepped in, 
dropped to ground level in a 
dizzying five-second plunge. Lo- 
cal police were waiting in the 
street. They had three teardrops. 

“He’s a block from the Vor- 
ster place, Freeman Kirby,” one 
of the policemen said. “The es- 
per’s been dragging him around 
for half an hour, but he’s dead 
set on going there.” 

“What does he want there?” 
Kirby asked. 

“He wants the reactor. He says 
he’s going to take it back to 
Mars and put it to some worth- 
while use.” 



Vanna gasped at the blas- 
phemy. Kirby shrugged, sat back, 
watched the streets flashing by. 
The teardrop halted. Kirby saw 
the Martian across the street. 

The girl who was with him was 
sultry, fullbodied, lush looking. 
She had one arm thrust through 
his, and she was close to Weiner’s 
side, cooing in his ear. Weiner 
laughed harshly and turned to 
her, pulled her close, then pushed 
her away. She clutched at him 
again. It was quite a scene, Kir- 
by thought. The street had been 
cleared. Local police and a couple 
of Ridblom’s men were watching 
grimly from the sidelines. 

Kirby went forward and ges- 
tured to the girl. She sensed in- 
stantly who he was, withdrew her 
arm from Weiner, and stepped 
away. The Martian swung round. 
“Found me, did you?” 

“I didn’t want you to do any- 
think you’d regret later on.” 
“Very loyal of you, Kirby. 
Well, as long as you’re here, you 
can be my accomplice. I’m on my 
way to the Vorster place. They’re 
wasting good fissionables in those 
reactors. You distract the priest, 
and I’m going to grab the blue 
blinker, and we’ll all live happily 
ever after. Just don’t let him 
shock you. That isn’t fun.” 

“Nat — ” 

“Are you with me or aren’t 
you, pal?” Weiner pointed to- 
ward the chapel, diagonally 



BLUE FIRE

across the street a block away, 
in a building almost as shabby 
as the one in Manhattan He 
started toward it. 

Kirby glanced uncertainly at 
Vanna. Then he crossed the 
street behind Weiner. He rea- 
lized that the altered girl was 
following, too. 

J ust as Weiner reached the en- 
trance to the Vorster place, 
Vanna dashed forward and cut 
in front of him. 

“Wait,” she said. “Don’t go in 
there to make trouble.” 

“Get out of my way, you 
phony-faced bitch!” 

“Please,” she said softly. 
“You’re a troubled man. You 
aren’t in harmony with yourself, 
let alone with the world around 
you. Come inside with me, and 
let me show you how to pray. 
There’s much for you to gain in 
there. If you’d only open your 
mind, open your heart — instead 
of standing there so smug in 
your hatred, in your drunken 
unwillingness to see — ” 

Weiner hit her. 

It was a backhand slap across 
the face. Surgical alteration jobs 
are fragile, and they aren’t 
meant to be slapped. Vanna fell 
to her knees, whimpering, and 
pressed her hands over her face. 
She still blocked the Martian’s 
way. Weiner drew his foot back 
as though he was going to kick 



her, and that was when Rey- 
nolds Kirby forgot he was paid 
to be a diplomat. 

Kirby strode forward, caught 
Weiner by the elbow, swung him 
around. The Martian was off 
balance. He clawed at Kirby for 
support. Kirby struck his hand 
down, brought a fist up, landed 
it solidly in Weiner’s muscular 
belly. 

Weiner made a small oofing 
sound and began to rock back- 
ward. Kirby had not struck a 
human being in anger in thirty 
years, and he did not realize un- 
til that moment what a savage 
pleasure there could be in some- 
thing so primordial. Adrenalin 
flooded his body. He hit Weiner 
again, just below the heart. The 
Martian, looking very surprised, 
sagged and went over backward, 
sprawling in the street, a blank 
expression on his face. 

“Get up,” Kirby said, almost 
dizzy with rage. 

Vanna plucked at his sleeve. 
“Don’t hit him again,” she mur- 
mured. Her metallic lips looked 
crumpled. Her cheeks glistened 
with fears. “Please don’t hit him 
any more.” 

Weiner remained where he 
was, shaking his head vaguely. 
A new figure came forward : a 
small leathery-faced man, in late 
middle age. The Martian consul. 
Kirby felt his belly chum with 
apprehension. 



128 



GALAXY 



f I 'he consul said, “I’m terribly 
sorry, Freeman Kirby. He’s 
really been running amok, hasn’t 
he? Well, we’ll take jurisdiction 
now. What he needs is to have 
some of his own people tell him 
what a fool he’s been.” 

Kirby stammered, “It was my 
fault. I lost sight of him. He 
shouldn’t be blamed. He — ” 
“We understand perfectly 
Freeman Kirby.” The consul 
smiled benignly, gestured, nod- 
ded as three aides came forward 
and gathered the fallen Weiner 
into their arms. 

Very suddenly the street was 
empty. Kirby stood, drained and 
stupefied, in front of the Vorster 
chapel, and Vanna was with him, 
and all the others were gone, 
Weiner vanishing like an ogre 
in a bad dream. It had not, Kir- 
by thought, been a very success- 
ful evening. But now it was over. 
Home, now. 

An hour and a half would see 
him in Tortola. A quick, lonely 
swim in the warm ocean — then 
half an hour in the Nothing 
Chamber tomorrow. No, an hour, 
Kirby decided. It would take 
that much to undo this night’s 
damage. An hour of disassocia- 
tion, an hour of drifting on the 
amniotic tide, sheltered, warm, 
unbothered by the pressures of 
the world, an hour of blissful if 
cowardly escape. Fine. Wonder- 
ful. 



Vanna said, “Will you come 
in, now?” 

“Into the chapel?” 

“Yes. Please.” 

“It’s late. I’ll get you back to 
New York right away. We’ll pay 
for any repairs that — that your 
face will need. The copter’s wait- 
ing. 

“Let it wait,” Vanna said. 
“Come inside.” 

“I want to get home.” 

“Home can wait too. Give me 
two hours with you, Ron. Just 
sit and listen to what they have 
to say in there. Come to the al- 
tar with me. You don’t have to 
do anything but listen. It’ll re- 
lax you, I promise that.” 

Kirby stared at her distorted, 
artificial face. Beneath the gro- 
tesque eyelids were real eyes — 
shining, imoloring. Why was she 
so eager? Did they pay a find- 
er’s fee of salvation for every 
lost soul dragged into the Blue 
Fire? Or could it be, Kirby won- 
dered, that she really and truly 
believed, that her heart and soul 
were bound up in this move- 
ment, that she was sincere in her 
conviction that the followers of 
Vorst would live through eter- 
nity, would, live to see men ride 
to the distant stars? 

e was so very tired. 

He wondered how the secur- 
ity officers of the Secretariat 
would regard it if a high official 




BLUE FIRE 



129 



like himself began to dabble in 

Vorsterism. 

He wondered, too, if he had 
any career at all left to salvage, 
after tonight’s fiasco with the 
Martian. What was there to lose? 
He could rest for a while in 
there. His head was splitting. 
Perhaps some esper in there 
would massage his frontal lobes 
for a while. Espers tended to be 
drawn to the Vorster chapels, 
didn’t they? 

The place seemed to have a 
pull. He had made his job his 
religion, but was that really good 
enough, he asked himself now? 

The sign over the door said: 

BROTHERHOOD OF THE 

IMMANENT RADIANCE 
COME YE ALL 
YE NOW MAY NEVER DIE 

HARMONIZE WITH THE 
ALL 

“Will you?” Vanna said. 

“All right,” Kirby muttered. 
“I’m willing. Let’s go harmonize 
with the All.” 

She took his hand. They step- 
ped through the door. About a 
dozen people were kneeling in 
the pews. Up front, the chapel 
leader was nudging the modera- 
tor rods out of the little reactor, 
and the first faint bluish glow 
was beginning to suffuse the 
room. Vanna guided Kirby into 
the last row. He looked toward 



the altar. The glow was deepen- 
ing, casting a strange radiance 
on the plump, dogged-looking 
man at the front of the room. 
Now greenish-white, now pur- 
plish, now the Blue Fire of the 
Vorsters. 

The opium of the masses, Kir- 
by thought, and the hackneyed 
phrase sounded foolishly cynical 
as it echoed through his brain. 
What was the Nothing Chamber, 
after all, but the opium of the 
elite? And the sniffer palaces, 
what were they? At least here 
they went for the mind and soul, 
not for the body. 

“My brothers,” said the man 
at the altar in a soft, fog-smooth 
voice, “we celebrate the under- 
lying Oneness here. Man and 
woman, star and stone, tree and 
bird, all consist of atoms, and 
those atoms contain particles 
moving at wondrous speeds. 
They are the electrons, my 
brothers. They show us the way 
to peace — ” 

Reynolds Kirby bowed his 
head. He could not bear to look 
at that glowing reactor, sudden- 
ly. There was a throbbing in his 
skull. He was distantly aware of 
Vanna beside him, smiling, 
warm, close. 

Fm listening, Kirby thought. 
Go on. Tell me! Tell me! I want 
to hear. God and the almighty 
electron help me, I want to hear!

BY WSLLY LEY 

THE OBSERVATORY 
ON THE MOON 

Spacecraft Ranger VII did its 
^ duty last year and took and 
transmitted so many pictures of 
an area in the Mare nubium (the 
Sea of Clouds) that this area has 
been dubbed Mare cognitum, 
(the “known sea”) since then. By 
the time you read this, the first 
of a series of “lunar orbiters” is 
being readied for a trip to the 



132 



moon. It, and its successors, will 
go into a tight orbit around the 
moon for picture-taking purposes 
with the specific goal of finding 
a landing area for the Apollo as- 
tronauts. Somewhere along the 
line a Surveyor spacecraft will be 
soft landed on the moon to trans- 
mit a panorama of the lunar 
landscape around the motionless 
device. 

A few years later men will do 
the actual on-site exploring. 

And then? 

Everybody is agreed on a num- 
ber of fundamental thoughts, 
goals and conclusions. Of course 
the first landing will be followed 
by others, there will be a base on 
the moon — or rather a minimum 
of two, one speaking Russian, the 
other English — and there is also 
agreement that the main purpose 
of the lunar base will be re- 
search : chemistry, crystallog- 

raphy, electronics, metallurgy, 
biology and last, but by no means 
least, astronomy. 

Building an observatory on the 
moon will be a curious turn- 
about. After having done what 
we could with telescopes, Ranger 
flights, Surveyor landings and 
manned landings to explore the 
moon, the moon itself will be 
utilized for further astronomical 
exploration. 

Of course it is difficult to im- 
agine a better location for an as- 
tronomical observatory than a 



place on the lunar surface. Since 
the atmosphere is negligible (at 
most of a density of 1/20, 000th 
of ours at sea level) the seeing 
will be perfect all the time, not 
only during the two-week night, 
but also all day long. Only two 
rather small areas of the sky will 
not be accessible; namely the 
area occupied by the sun and its 
corona and the one occupied by 
the earth. But any astronomer 
will know in advance where the 
sun and the earth are going to 
be. 

Because of the lack of an at- 
mosphere an object just above 
the horizon can be observed just 
as well as one near the zenith. 
And since the moon is a negligible 
distance from the earth, as cos- 
mic distances go, the fixed stars 
will be in the customary places, 
existing charts can, therefore, be 
used without making any change 
at all. 

To make the picture even more 
attractive, the moon does not 
move fast in its orbit (0.6 mile 
per second) and it needs a whole 
month to turn on its axis. This 
means that the apparent motion 
of fixed stars and of extragalac- 
tic objects across the lunar sky is 
quite slow. Any object can be 
kept in the field of view for an 
endless time ; we can start dream- 
ing right now about what a 240- 
hour exposure of the Andromeda 
galaxy may show.

longer you look at all the 
possible advantages the more 
it becomes clear that an astron- 
omical observatory on the moon 
will be something very much 
worth having. Just for the sake 
of completeness I would like to 
add that this is not a new idea 
to astronomers. The two lunar 
observers Wilhelm Beer and 
Heinrich von Madler who had 
completed a 3-foot chart of the 
moon in 1834, published a book 
explaining the features on their 
chart in 1837. In that book they 
included a short section on the 
advantages of an astronomical 
observatory on the moon! If the 
first lunar observatory is official- 
ly opened in 1977 — a reasonable 
estimate — 140 years will have 
gone by between first dream and 
reality. During the latter part of 
these fourteen decades astron- 
omy added to itself another 
branch, namely radio astronomy, 
something even Beer and von 
Madler did not dream about. 

There is a reason for bringing 
up radio astronomy even before 
the discussion is really underway. 
It is because the type of instru- 
ment used may determine the 
choice of locations for the obser- 
vatory. Beer and von Madler had 
said that the lunar observatory 
should be on the moon’s farside, 
so that earthlight would not in- 
terfere. They still thought that 
the moon had a reasonably dense 



atmosphere, much less dense 
than ours, of course, but still 
dense enough to make the sky 
light if a strongly luminous body, 
like the sun or the earth, was 
overhead. We now know better; 
what there is of a lunar atmos- 
phere will not produce any op- 
tical effects. In fact an observa- 
tory using normal telescopes and 
astronomical cameras should be 
located on the lunar hemisphere 
visible from earth for ease in 
communications. 

But when it comes to radio 
astronomy the earth does inter- 
fere; not the planet itself, but 
the activities of its inhabitants. 
More and more wave bands have 
to be utilized for communication 
of all kinds and the volume of 
radio transmissions into and from 
space is bound to increase sharp- 
ly. Communications satellites will 
be in action, weather watching 
satellites will send a steady 
stream of information to the 
ground, navigational satellites 
will broadcast their position when 
requested by navigators at sea. 
There will be all kinds of special 
devices, manned orbiting labor- 
atories and so forth, in various 
orbits around the earth, all of 
them broadcasting and receiving. 
One worried radio astronomer has 
already gone on record as saying 
that his special branch of science 
will be blotted out a decade from 
now. 



134 



GALAXY 



But the other side of the moon 
is a perfect refuge for radio as- 
tronomers, since the bulk of the 
moon will protect their instru- 
ments from all the man-made 
radio noises so that they will be 
able to study radio noise coming 
in from deep space. 

\T ot quite forty years ago some- 

^ body in Germany — probab- 
ly Max Valier, but I am not sure 
— sold an article on the advan- 
tages of a lunar observatory to a 
German weekly magazine. Since 
this was an illustrated family 
magazine the article had to have 
a picture to go with it and a staff 
artist was called in to do the 
job. 

The picture showed a mag- 
nificently rocky lunar landscape 
with tall and steep mountains 
and on one of the mountain tops 
there was the observatory, with 
three cupolas of different sizes, 
and three telescopes showing in 
the cupola slots, all three look- 
ing in the same direction. I’ll ad- 
mit freely that I don’t know just 
what the lunar observatory will 
look like, but I know it won’t 
look like that illustration. 

To begin with it will not be on 
a mountain top. On earth you 
build observatories on high 
mountains to have as much of 
the troublesome atmosphere as 
possible below. On the moon the 
favored site for an observatory 



would be one where the observer 
had a clear view down to the 
horizon in all directions. Since 
the horizon on the moon is much 
closer to the observer than on 
earth this is not a very difficult 
demand, the center of any large 
flat-floored crater will do. To an 
observer in the center of Arch- 
imedes, for example, the horizon 
would appear unmarred since 
even the ringwall of the crater it- 
self would be below the horizon. 

On earth the cupola has the 
purpose of protecting the expen- 
sive instrument from the ele- 
ments, rain, hail, snow and some- 
times wind-blown dust and sand. 
On the moon protection is need- 
ed from the steady infall of 
micrometeorites, but it probably 
won’t take the shape of the cus- 
tomary cupola. 

When it comes to the instru- 
ment itself the layman is apt to 
visualize something large and im- 
pressive, possibly a big reflecting 
telescope like the 80-inch reflec- 
tor of the Kitt Peak National Ob- 
servatory not far from Tucson, or 
at least a 36-inch refractor like 
that of the Lick Observatory. 
The answer to such ideas is a 
plain “no” and the reason is 
weight. But it may be useful to 
explain the two main types of 
optical telescopes first. 

The instrument astronomers 
call a refractor is a very large 
spyglass, a tube holding two

lenses or rather lens systems. The 
purpose of the tube is two-fold; 
it carries the main lens at its out- 
er end and it also keeps out stray 
light. Since the main lens is 
heavy the tube carrying it must 
be very strong and is heavy too, 
for that reason. 

Things are a little bit better in 
the case of the reflector where 
the main optical element is a 
carefully ground mirror. The 
mirror is located at the lower 
end of the tube. Since all large 
modern reflectors are housed in 
cupolas the tube does not need 
to keep out stray light and is, 
therefore, usually a lattice con- 
struction and no longer a tube 
in the proper meaning of the 
word. 

nphe largest refractor ever built 
— with one exception that 
will be discussed below — is the 
40-inch refractor of the Yerkes 
observatory, next largest is the 
36-inch of the Lick Observatory. 
The 32.7-inch of the Paris Ob- 
servatory at Meudon holds third 
place. 

Largest of the reflectors is, of 
course, the 200-inch on Palomar 
Mountain, with the 120-inch of 
Lick Observatory and the 100- 
inch on Mt. Wilson in second and 
third places. 

The customary question 
whether a refractor or a reflector 
is “better” has no short answer; 




Fig. 1. Two possible orbits tor communication 
satellites around the moon. 



it would be like asking whether a 
Diesel engine or a gasoline en- 
gine is “better”. It depends on 
the job, plus other factors. At 
the present state of technology 
we can build 100-inch, 120-inch 
reflectors, but we could not build 
refractors with corresponding 
lens diameters. The point to keep 
in mind, in general, as well as 
with specific reference to the 
lunar observatory, is that a larg- 
er telescope does not only pro- 
duce a larger magnification. The 
main thing is that a larger lens, 
or mirror, has a larger light gath- 
ering power and can therefore 
reveal the existence of very faint 
objects, as for example very dis- 
tant galaxies. In layman’s lan- 
guage this is usually expressed by 
saying that the bigger telescope 
can “see farther” which is correct 
only insofar that a very faint gal- 
axy is likely to be much farther 
away than a fairly bright galaxy. 

The light gathering ability and 
the resolution (alias magnifica- 



136 



GALAXY 



tion) do not increase at the same 
rate as the diameter of the lens or 
mirror increases. The resolution 
increases in proportion to the 
diameter. Hence the 200-inch re- 
flector on Palomar Mountain has 
a resolution twice as good as the 
100-inch on Mt. Wilson. But the 
light gathering ability increases 
with the square of the diameter. 
Therefore the 200-inch can gath- 
er four times as much light as the 
100-inch. Hence the targets of 
the 200-inch, and of the 100-inch 
too, are usually distant galaxies. 
For observing Jupiter, which is 
bright enough, a much smaller 
instrument is very nearly as good 
as these giants. 

But now I cannot hold back 
any more on the problem of 
weight and I feel obliged to give 
advance warning that things will 
look quite bleak for a few para- 
graphs to come. 

npo begin with a historical ex- 
ample: Lord Rosse’s “giant 
of Parsonstown” a 7 2 -inch reflec- 
tor, had a total weight of 36,000 
pounds. Its tube, made of sturdy 
wood and strengthened with iron 
hoops, alone weighed 15,000 
pounds. Oh well, that was a cen- 
tury ago. We can build lighter 
now. Well, maybe we build bet- 
ter, but not lighter. The Kitt 
Peak 80-inch reflector has an 
overall weight of 70 tons, with- 
out the foundation, that is. Lick’s 



120-inch is estimated to weigh 
40 tons (just the instrument and 
mounting) while the Palomar 
200-inch has a weight of 150 tons, 
the mirror alone weighs 14J^ 
tons — the glass disk before 
grinding weighed in at 20 tons. 

Nor can any comfort be de- 
rived from the weights of the big- 
ger radio telescopes. Harvard’s 
George R. Agassiz radio telescope 
near Cambridge has a 60-foot 
dish weighing 8,000 pounds (be- 
ing of extra light construction) 
but the total weight is 103,600 
pounds. The Navy’s 84-foot radio 
telescope of Maryland Point Ob- 
servatory has a total weight of 
170,000 pounds, the dish alone 
weighs 15,000 pounds. And Great 
Britain’s Jordell Bank radio tele- 
scope is not only the biggest fully 
steerable radio telescope in ex- 
istence, it is also exceptionally 
heavy: the 250-foot dish weighs 
750 tons and the whole moveable 
structure adds up to 2,000 tons. 

Of course I am well aware of 
the fact that under the moon’s 
lesser gravity less metal will pro- 
vide the same structural strength 
A radio telescope of the same 
dimensions as the one at Jodrell 
Bank might have 350 tons earth 
weight (and weigh only 60 tons 
on the moon), but this weight 
would have to be lifted out of the 
atmosphere against the earth’s 
gravitational pull and would then 
have to be soft-landed on the

137 



moon. And while a radio tele- 
scope could still be transported 
in pieces that could be designed 
with the weight carrying capacity 
of the then existing rockets in 
mind, any optical telescope has 
one piece that has to be trans- 
ported as a whole: the mirror in 
the case of a reflector and the 
main lens in the case of a refrac- 
tor. And the weight of a mirror or 
lens could not be reduced very 
much, even for use on the moon. 

Are we then limited to 8-inch 
and 10-inch telescopes for the 
lunar observatory? Not necessari- 
ly, because at one time in the 
past a refractor of an even larger 
size than the 40-inch of Yerkes 
Observatory was built along un- 
conventional lines. It is usually 
not mentioned in astronomical 
books for two reasons: it never 
did any scientific work and it was 
dismantled only a few years af- 
ter it had been built. 

I t was the 49.2-inch refractor 
that could be seen at the Paris 
Universal Exhibition of 1900. At 
the time the French considered 
themselves the leading nation in 
the manufacture of precision op- 
tical instruments. Of course when 
this claim was made Americans 
tended to mutter “Alvin G. 
Clark” and Germans said “Carl 
Zeiss”, but these old rivalries are 
by now a thing of the past. At 
any event the Palais de FOptique 



at the Paris Exhibition was to 
have a very large telescope. Since 
the biggest instrument up to that 
time had been Lord Rosse’s re- 
flector — inactive since 1878 — a 
three-meter (circa 110-inch) re- 
flector was considered first, but 
facilities for casting a glass disk 
of such size simply did not ex- 
ist, not in France and not any- 
where else on our planet. But 
an 80-inch disk for a mirror could 
be cast, and a 50-inch disk for a 
lens. 

These two facilities were com- 
bined for the 49.2 -inch refractor. 
Since the main lens was expect- 
ed to weigh close to a ton no 
attempts at normal mounting 
were made. The lens was mount- 
ed at the front end of a 190-foot 
steel tube which was resting on 
the ground horizontally. The eye 
piece and plate holders for 
photographic plates, 30-inches 
square, were in a small wheeled 
cart connected to the steel tube 
by bellows like those of an over- 
sized camera. For focussing pur- 
poses this cart could be moved 
as much as five feet, its wheel 
resting on a short section of nar- 
row gauge railroad track. In ord- 
er to reflect starlight into the 
telescope a 12 -inch thick plane 
mirror, with a diameter of 79 
inches, was set 'into a vertical 
fork mounting. 

The disappointing performance 
of the instrument was not due to 



138 



GALAXY 



poor optics but had other rea- 
sons. No provision had been 
made for ventilating the steel 
tube properly so that the air in- 
side the tube was probably quite 
humid. But the main reason was 
the location of the instrument; 
from the point of view of the ob- 
serving astronomer it was un- 
doubtedly the worst location pos- 
sible. It was not many feet above 
sea level, on fair grounds where 
hundreds of searchlights were 
operated on and off, and near a 
very large city which must have 
been much smokier in 1900 than 
it is now. 

Still, this type of telescope 
might be the thing to use on the 
moon. The heaviest part that 
would have to be transported 
would be the main lens, and if 
we have a 30-inch lens in mind 
that means a weight (uncrated) 
of around 750 pounds. The plane 
mirror for reflecting starlight in- 
to the telescope could be much 
lighter than the one used in 1900 
and would weigh less than the 
main lens. Instead of using a 
horizontal 30-inch steel tube one 
could drill a horizontal, or even 
slanting, 30-inch tube through a 
convenient rock formation. Hous- 
ing the eye piece and photogra- 
phic equipment in a separate car 
would solve the problem of 
breathing for the observer. With 
any conventional telescope one 
would have the problem of either 



enclosing the whole telescope in 
an underground room with 
breathable air, or else exposing 
the whole telescope to the vacu- 
um of the lunar surface and hav- 
ing the observer in a spacesuit. 
Neither sounds like an optimal 
solution, but if a telescope of 
that type were used, the tunnel 
in the rock could be a vacuum 
while the observers are in their 
enclosed cabin with an airlock 
to the interior of the lunar base. 

T~'virect observation, which was 
the rule in the past, is now 
pretty much the exception and 
used mainly for work on other 
planets. Practically everything 
else is photographic work and if 
an astronomical camera is used, 
it can well be operated by a man 
in a spacesuit since his main 
jobs would be to aim the cam- 
era and to change plates. And 
astronomical cameras, fortunate- 
ly, are much lighter than astro- 
nomical telescopes. Harvard’s 
“Super Schmidt” meteor camera 
at Las Cruces is an 18-inch cam- 
era with a total weight of 5,000 
pounds. Redesigning such a cam- 
era for use on the moon could 
eliminate a good percentage of 
this weight, possibly as much as 
50 percent. It must also be kept 
in mind that so far nobody had 
tried to design light large scale 
astronomical equipment, all the 
efforts to eliminate weight have

gone into small portable tele- 
scopes. 

But how about reflectors with 
a lightweight mirror? The mirror 
does not have to be glass, as is 
the case with the 200-inch and 
its smaller rivals. The reason 
why instrument makers went 
from Sir William Herschel’s 
speculum metal mirrors to glass 
mirrors which were silvered (and 
later aluminized) was purely 
practical. The chemical action 
of the atmosphere slowly reduces 
the reflectivity of the mirror. 
Partly it is straight oxidation, 
partly the action of gases which 
are not frequent in the atmo- 
sphere, but often present, for ex- 
ample sulphur dioxide that is re- 
leased not only by industry but 
by volcanoes, too. If a speculum 
metal mirror grew dim, it meant 
repolishing, which is at the very 
least tedious work. If a silvered 
or aluminized glass mirror grows 
dim, the glass disk is simply re- 
silvered. But on the moon there 
is no atmosphere which causes 
trouble via unwanted chemical 
reactions. 

Could we produce an all alu- 
minum mirror of little weight 
and with a diameter of, say, 50 
inches? Of course lightweight 
parabolic mirrors of a diameter 
of 4 to 6 feet exist for various 
purposes, but they are not ac- 
curate enough for astronomical 
use. Again since no work in this 



direction has been carried out, 
we don’t know whether it can 
be done or not. It would be a 
development project which might 
not even be very expensive. 

T)efore we look at the back- 
side of the moon and the 
radio telescope station we might 
think quickly about a likely 
location for the visual observa- 
tory. My own suggestion is the 
large half crater with the beauti- 
ful name of Sinus itidum (Bay 
of Rainbows) at the northern 
edge of the Mare imbrium. 
There the horizon would be as 
smooth as it is on earth a hun- 
dred miles from the nearest 
shoreline at sea. Moreover, the 
ground would not get too hot. 
Most people “know” that the 
noonday temperature on the 
moon is near the boiling point of 
water. This information is cor- 
rect, but it holds true only near 
the lunar equator. In the area of 
Sinus iridum the noonday tem- 
perature of the ground will be 
around 80° Fahrenheit. The 
night temperature will be as low 
as anywhere else, an estimated 
200° Fahrenheit below zero, but 
at least the daytime tempera- 
tures do not climb as high as 
they do at the equator. 

An observatory in the center 
of the Sinus iridum would have 
a location which would corre- 
spond more or less to an observa- 



140 



GALAXY 



tory near Paris or Vienna as far 
as the astronomical view is con- 
cerned. It would be excellent 
for the northern stars, but would 
not do so well for the southern 
stars. The lunar equivalent of a 
Cape Town Observatory would 
be located in Clavius. It looks 
as if we had a choice between 
two observatories in two differ- 
ent locations or of braving the 
daytime heat of the equator, 
which would not be too difficult 
to beat by digging in. But two 
observatories seem to be a better 
answer just because of the work- 
load that will indubitably de- 
scend on them. Instrument time 
is tightly apportioned in terres- 
trial observatories, and trying to 
observe the whole sky from just 
one observatory is likely to de- 
mand the impossible. 

Let us now consider the radio 
telescope on the farside of the 
moon. Like its optical counter- 
part it should be well away from 
the lunar equator and for the 
same reason. And as for its con- 
struction we have a “prototype” 
on earth right now: the Arecibo 
radio telescope which has the 
largest antenna dish of all, name- 
ly 1,000 feet in diameter, and 
weighs less per square foot than 
any other radio telescope, main- 
ly because it is also, in a man- 
ner of speaking, lying flat on the 
ground. 

In its construction a natural 



hollow in the ground was uti- 
lized. It was not “lined with 
wiremesh” as one can read oc- 
casionally, but the wire mesh 
was suspended across the hollow 
in such a manner that it has the 
proper curved surface. The wire 
mesh is supported by cables to 
which ballast bars are tied. The 
ballast bars, by their weight, 
change the curve which a sus- 
pended cable would form natu- 
rally into a segment of a sphere. 

F or those who are surprised at 
the mention of wire mesh 
for the “reflector” I hasten to 
explain that a reflector for radio 
waves does not have to be a con- 
tinuous surface, even though 
some of the smaller dishes have 
been made of sheet metal. It is 
all a question of the wavelength 
you are dealing with. The re- 
flecting mirror of an optical 
telescope would still be optical- 
ly perfect, even if it had millions 
of tiny holes, provided that the 
size of each hole is less than 
l/20th of the wavelength reflect- 
ed. Since the waves of visible 
light are so short, this is only a 
point of theoretical information. 
But if you deal with 20 centi- 
meter (circa 8 inch) radiowaves, 
holes of 1 centimeter in diameter 
are permissible, hence wire mesh 
can be used. Theoretically the 
spaces between the wires in the 
Arecibo telescope would have to 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



141 



be smaller than 5 centimeters 
and the deviation of the shape 
of the net has the same limit. 
For the radio waves to be re- 
ceived this is a “smooth” mirror. 
In reality the spacing of the 
wires at Arecibo is only 1.3 cen- 
timeters and the error in shape 
is at most 2.5 centimeters. 

Incidentally the Arecibo tele- 
scope can be operated as a pure 
radio telescope, just receiving 
waves that come from space, or 
else it can be operated as a radar 
telescope, sending out pulses of 
radio waves and catching their 
reflections. The structure where 
the radio waves are received and 
the radar impulses are transmit- 
ted is suspended on cables 472 
feet above the large bowl. Of 
course a radio telescope of this 
type is not as versatile as the 
fully steerable Jodrell Bank 
equipment, but for weight rea- 
sons the radio telescope on the 
moon will have to be of that 
type. 

One more problem needs to be 
discussed. 

The distance between the two 
observatories is likely to be on 
the order of 2,000 miles. They 
have to communicate with each 
other and possibly also with some 
research outposts in other dis- 
tant areas of the moon. The 
most practicable and also the 
cheapest way of doing it will be 
by moon-orbiting communica- 



tions satellite. But because the 
moon’s gravitational field is 
weak, a moon-orbiting satellite 
travels slowly. A satellite needing 
two hours to complete one orbit 
would be 1,075 miles above sea 
level in the case of the earth, 
the two-hour orbit for the moon 
is only 90 miles above its sur- 
face. And because of the moon’s 
curvature it will be visible only 
along a rather narrow lane on 
the ground. It would help a little 
if the communications satellite 
were placed in a polar orbit. But 
a much larger orbit (see Fig. 1) 
would be preferable. 

A communications satellite in a 
16-hour orbit would be visible, 
and therefore ’’'■•cable, for sev- 
eral hours at a time — if it is 
visible from both observatories 
simultaneously there could be 
“live” communication. Other- 
wise storage tapes would have to 
be used. 

But a satellite in such an or- 
bit would move much faster in 
the “periselenion” (closest to the 
moon) sector of its orbit than in 
the opposite, the “aposelenion” 
sector. This fact can be utilized 
in the following manner: the or- 
bit of the communications satel- 
lite could be tilted in such a way 
that aposelenion is vertically 
above the half way point of the 
line connecting the two observa- 
tories. In that case the communi- 
cations satellite would be above 



142 



GALAXY 



the horizon for both observator- 
ies for about 10 hours and would 
be below the horizon for one of 
them, or both, for only 6 hours. 

The astronomical observatory 
on the moon about which Beer 
and von Madler dreamed more 
than a century ago will become 
reality long before the current 
century draws to a close. But it 
will look quite differently from 
the terrestrial shape these two 
observers probably had in mind. 

—WILLY LEY 

OBSERVATORY 
ON THE MOON 

by Donald H. Menzel 

TV /Ty good friend, Willy Ley, 
has pointed out the useful- 
ness of a manned observatory on 
the surface of the moon. We 
agree completely on the excel- 
lence of a lunar site, with clear, 
black skies by day as well as 
by night. The stars stand steady 
and untwinkling in this airless, 
waterless world. 

I do not agree with Willy Ley, 
however, concerning the types 
of telescopes to be used in this 
observatory, the operation of 
such telescopes, their location on 
tire surface of the moon, or the 
specific programs that one would 
use the instruments for. 

First of all, with reference to 
tire location of a radio telescope, 

OBSERVATORY ON THE MOON 



I am not altogether convinced 
that the best location would be 
on the far side of the moon. 
True, such a location would be 
free from man-made radio noise 
of terrestrial origin. But this is 
not likely to be particularly 
troublesome. One must not over- 
look the advantages of direct 
communication from earth to 
moon that would result from an 
observatory located on the side 
turned toward the earth. In any 
event, we must weigh the dis- 
advantages of having the earth 
available to help us in certain 
radio experiments. Today as- 
tronomers find the moon a big 
help, as it moves over this or 
that radio source, hiding it from 
view. The earth could be similar- 
ly used for a moon-based tele- 
scope. It could give us important 
information, for example, about 
the spatial distribution of radio 
sources on the sun or within the 
solar atmosphere, during those 
times when the earth eclipses the 
sun. 

In my opinion, the advantages 
of an optical observatory on the 
moon are even mort spectacular 
than those for radio astronomy. 
Here, Willy Ley and I concur 
that the observatory should be 
located on the earthward hemi- 
sphere. 

The moon’s orbital velocity is 
irrelevant. We correct for the 
moon’s rotation, slow though it 

143 



is, by means of telescopic con- 
trols similar to those on earth 
True the long lunar day (or 
night), lasting 14 earthly days, 
would permit long exposures on 
certain faint objects. But the 
most obvious advantage to a 
moon-based observatory would 
be our ability to study the struc- 
ture of the universe in light of 
the wavelengths that fail to pene- 
trate the earth’s atmosphere, 
light or energy that we would 
describe as far ultraviolet, or 
even X-rays. For such a purpose 
man clearly needs a reflecting 
telescope, not a refractor. Glass 
absorbs the ultraviolet light — 
hence no one would ever con- 
sider building a major refractor, 
as Willy Ley suggests. 

I disagree completely when 
he states that today we cannot 
build lighter telescopes, even 
though we may build better ones. 
The basic problem is not the 
gravitational field of the earth, 
although that enters indirectly, 
but the gravitational field of the 
moon where the instrument ulti- 
mately has to operate. We have 
built mirrors that are much 
lighter than the solid glass mir- 
rors used for the Palomar giant. 
A relatively thin layer of quartz 
melted on top of a much thicker, 
but stable, layer of foamed 
quartz gives a very rigid mirror. 
The weight of the mirror is a 
small part of the weight of the 



telescope as a whole. We could 
most certainly send to the moon 
a 100-inch mirror or larger. But 
in the low gravitational field of 
the moon, the mirror and its 
supporting telescope will be sub- 
ject to only one-sixth of the gra- 
vitational field of the earth. Dis- 
tortions will be correspondingly 
less and easier to control. The 
telescope can be much lighter in 
consequence. 

Willy Ley seems to be con- 
cerned that the astronomer might 
experience difficulties operating 
in a vacuum. As a matter of fact, 
electronic receivers would carry 
the image from the telescope it- 
self to underground, pressured 
chambers where the observer 
could operate in comfort. Re- 
mote control would enable him 
to perform all of the necessary 
telescope operations. In this way, 
we should have the enormous 
advantage of high resolution of a 
large telescope, in addition to its 
light-gathering power. 

I might mention here that the 
telescope I have described could 
not possibly function for X-ray 
astronomy. The X-ray telescope 
would look something like a giant 
insect’s eye, an enormous honey- 
comb of tiny cells turning around 
in space to measure the intensi- 
ties of cosmic X-rays coming 
from different directions of 
space. Electronic detectors would 
record the information. Such de- 



144 



GALAXY 



tectors have already been sent 
up into space by Dr. Herbert 
Friedman and his collaborators 
at the U. S. Naval laboratory. 
There they have detected X- 
rays emitted by various kinds of 
astronomical bodies. Such studies 
are extremely important. 

Willy Ley suggests that tem- 
perature considerations would 
indicate a preference for the 
location of either a radio or opti- 
cal observatory at some distance 
from the lunar equator. The 
temperature of the equipment 
would, beyond doubt, get pretty 
high near the equator, if the in- 
strument were not shielded in 
some way or other. I think that 
a very simple screen could be 
devised to put the instrument 
completely in shadow, to protect 
it from the sun’s rays. Alterna- 
tively, one could certainly cool 
the instrument by circulating 
some fluid through it, as we do 
today in many industrial plants. 

However, if one decides to 
move away from the equator, for 
one reason or another I should 
most certainly recommend that 
the first lunar telescope be 
placed in the southern hemi- 
sphere, not in the northern. This 
is because the most interesting 
and significant part of our stellar 
universe, which such a telescope 
would study, lies in the southern 
hemisphere. Certainly Sinus Iri- 
dium would be a good location 

OBSERVATORY ON THE MOON 



for the second moon-based opti- 
cal telescope. 

I question very much whether 
the first lunar radio telescope 
should resemble in any way the 
Arecibo horizontal dish. The low 
gravity of the moon should make 
particularly desirable the con- 
struction of at least a partially 
steerable dish and that is what 
I would most certainly recom- 
mend. In any event, such a per- 
manent dish, located far from 
the equator, would not be able 
to study the sun or the planets 
of the solar system. Indeed, the 
choice of Arecibo, Puerto Rico, 
as the site for the big dish was 
largely dictated by astronomical 
considerations. 

Finally, I should most certain- 
ly recommend that, if a radio 
telescope is to be built on the 
moon, it be located close to the

not only to simplify the com- 
munication system, whose com-

to simplify the whole problem of

However, despite our disagree- 
ment on details, Willy Ley and I 
agree completely that such an 
observatory will become an 
eventuality within the next three 
or four decades. I wish, more- 
over, to emphasize the knowl- 
edge to be gained from such an 
observatory and associated scien-

AN EYE FOR SILENE 

by Robert S. Richardson 

^T'here is one aspect to this 
■*- business of putting an ob- 
servatory on the Moon that has 
me worried. What are the astro- 
nomers on Luna going to use as 
a subject for conversation? 

Astronomers are not the sort 
of people who have a large fund 
of small talk. They consist most- 
ly of grim, taciturn individuals 
with a gloomy outlook on life. 
Conversation often languishes 
when they gather around the 
dinner table at their mountain- 
top observatory. But there is one 
subject that always interests 
them: What is the seeing? 

The seeing, of course, refers 
to the appearance of the image 
in the telescope as affected by 
atmospheric conditions. If the 
seeing is bad they grumble about 
their luck and swear that some- 
body up there hates them. If the 
seeing is good they perk up 
momentarily. Now on the Moon 
they will always have “Seeing 
10” — perfect! In fact, there 
won’t really be any seeing. What 
a horrible situation. A bunch of 



astronomers with nothing to com- 
plain about! 

It is impossible for a person 
without telescopic experience to 
appreciate the extent that as- 
tronomers are handicapped by 
the atmosphere. A physicist or 
chemist works in the laboratory 
where conditions are under their 
control. But an astronomer is 
completely at the mercy of his 
environment. 

It is not just a clear sky that 
he needs. After a storm the sky 
may be crystal clear. But the air 
is so turbulent the stars are 
twinkling like mad. Which means 
that in the telescope they will 
be jumping all over the place. 
Sometimes a star will explode 
right in your eye! And the big- 
ger the telescope the more ad- 
versely is it affected by seeing. 
There are scarcely two dozen 
nights in the year when a tele- 
scope like the 200-inch Hale can 
approach the full extent of its 
optical power. (Curiously enough 
the seeing is usually improved 
by smoke and haze. Possibly the 
smoke particles reduce turbu- 
lence by loading the atmosphere. 
E. E. Barnard said the best view 
of Venus he ever had was when 
the sky over the Lick Observa- 
tory was brown from a forest 
fire.) 

Even on those all too rare 
nights when the seeing is good 
the atmosphere is still an obsta- 



146 



GALAXY 



de. For it prevents about 30 per 
cent of the light of a star from 
reaching the telescope. Worse 
still . this is the 30 per cent 
that contains some of the most 
valuable information about the 
sun and stars. Beginning in the 
ultraviolet at wavelength 3200A, 
the spectrum begins to weaken 
and at 2950A is gone complete- 
ly, due to absorption in the 
ozonosphere. Further absorption 
due to molecules and atoms of 
oxygen and nitrogen continues 
into the X-ray region. Only re- 
cently has this “rocket ultravio- 
let” region become accessible to 
exploration. 

But on the airless surface of 
the Moon we would get all the 
radiation of the celestial bodies. 
The stars would be hard un- 
winking points of light set in a 
sky never stained by clouds. 

Exposure times on stellar spec- 
tra should be drastically reduced. 
When the seeing is bad the 
image of your star is dancing 
around on the polished face of 
the slit jaws instead of going in- 
to the s lit where you want it. 
Direct photography will also be 
benefited. The light in a star 
image will be concentrated in a 
tiny point on the emulsion in- 
stead of being spread over an 
area to form a spot. 

For work on the Moon the 
best type of optical telescope 
would seem to be the reflector, 




Approximate position of site selected for the 
lunar base by Air Force Cambridge Research 
Laboratories. It is near the center of the 
lunar face in the highlands just south of the 
HYGINUS RULE, near the crater AGRIPPA 
at 8° E long., 5° N lat. (crater nearest bot- 
tom of photo), (notice that E and W here do 
not conform to the usual convention on lunar 
maps.) This would not necessarily be the 
site of a lunar observatory. 

as the reflector or mirror type 
of telescope can be made so 
much larger than the refractor 
or lens type. Also, the reflector 
is such a versatile sort of instru- 
ment compared with the refrac- 
tor. Furthermore, a refractor 
would bring you right back to all 
the disadvantages of observing 
through the atmosphere in the 
violet and ultraviolet, since glass 
begins to absorb strongly around 
3400A. All work in the ultra- 
violet has to be done with mirror 
systems and concave grating 
spectrographs. 



AN EYE FOR SELENE

The trouble with a refractor is 
that you can’t do anything but 
look through it. But astronomers 
never look into a telescope any 
more except to focus it and 
make sure they’re set on the 
right object. There are very few 
astronomers today who are ex- 
perienced visual observers, of 
the caliber of such greats as 
Schiaparelli and Antonia 3i and 
Lowell. The only ones I can 
think of at the moment are 
Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer 
of Pluto, and Audouin Dollfus of 
the Meudon Observatory. 

LOCATION OF THE 
LUNAR BASE 

At least six different people 
have picked out as many differ- 
ent sites for the lunar base. The 
most extensive investigation on 
this important problem has been 
made by John W. Salisbury and 
Charles F. Campen, Jr., of the 
Air Force Cambridge Research 
Laboratories. (AFCRL 870, GRD 
Research Notes No. 70, Project 
7698, October, 1961.) After a re- 
view of all the material they 
recommend that “location of the 
lunar base in the highlands 
would be permissible because 
the discontinuous layers of the 
rubble, rock flour and meteoric 
material overlying the fractured 
basement rock would not present 
a collapse hazard. The maria, on 



the other hand, are considered 
to bear near-surface cavities 
probably twice the size of those 
predicted under the volcanic 
theory. This added collapse haz- 
ard, when compared to the neg- 
ligible collapse hazard of the 
highlands, makes the highlands 
a more favorable site for base 
location, and such a site is ad- 
vocated in this report.” In par- 
ticular “. considering the prob- 
able lunar structure, surface 
characteristics and natural re- 
sources, it appears that the lunar 
base should be located in the 
highlands near a rille, but not 
near a recent large crater such 
as Copernicus or Kepler. Also, 
bearing in mind astronomical, 
guidance and propulsion require- 
ments, for a base near the equa- 
tor and in the center of the lunar 
face, a location in the highlands 
just south of the Hyginus Rille, 
near the crater Agrippa (8°E 
long., 5°N lat.), is provisionally 
proposed for the lunar base.” 

THE ASTRONOMICAL 
OBSERVATORIES 

When it comes to making as- 
tronomical observations on the 
Moon we are reminded of the 
famous statement Lincoln made 
about establishing confidence 
with the public. At one of the 
poles of the Moon you can ob- 
serve half the stars all of the 



148 



GALAXY 



time; at the lunar equator you 
can observe all of the stars half 
of the time; but there is no place 
on the Moon where you can ob- 
serve all of the stars all of the 
time. One thing we can say: it 
is absolutely essential to have 
two lunar observatories located 
180° apart. 

As seen from the north pole of 
the Moon the stars would ap- 
pear to move in circles around 
a point in the zenith near the 
faint star 36 Draconis, which for 
want of a better object will have 
to serve as the North Star of 
the Moon. For the north polar 
observatory the astronomers 
would never be able to study 
stars south of the ecliptic such 
as Sirius, Antares or Rigel. At 
the south lunar pole the stars 
would circle around a point at 
the zenith near the 4th magni- 
tude star Delta Mensae. The 
South Star would probably be 
Canopus, the next brightest star 
to Sirius, although it is about 15° 
from the south celestial pole. 
From the south polar observa- 
tory the astronomers would nev- 
er be able to study stars north 
of the ecliptic such as Capella, 
Vega or Arcturus. From either 
observatory the Sun, Earth and 
planets would always be near 
the horizon and only visible in- 
termittently. 

If the two observatories were 
located 180° apart along the lu- 



nar equator, each would see half 
the celestial sphere at any in- 
stant. As on the Earth, the stars 
would rise in the east and set in 
the west, only their diurnal mo- 
tion would be much slower, the 
Moon requiring 27.32 days to 
make a complete rotation rela- 
tive to the stars. The Earth, Sun 
and planets would pass close to 
the zenith. The Sun would move 
even more deliberately than the 
stars, taking nearly 15 days to 
pass across the sky and set be- 
low the western horizon. To a 
casual observer the Earth would 
be a huge bluish globe hanging 
nearly motionless in the sky, al- 
though careful observation would 
show that it swings through an 
angle of about 8° to the east 
and to the west, and over a total 
distance of about 13° in a north- 
south direction. 

Although the Earth would 
scarcely seem to move relative 
to the lunar landscape, a few 
hours’ watching would reveal 
that it is moving fairly rapidly 
relative to the stars, passing over 
an angular distance equal to its 
width in 4 hours. This apparent 
motion of the Earth, of course, 
is due to the revolution of the 
Moon around it. 

If for some reason it is desir- 
able to have the Earth in view 
of both observatories at all times 
they should be located on the 
equator between longitudes 82° E 



AN EYE FOR SELENE

end 82 °W. But it would prob- 
ably be advantageous to have a 
radio telescope located on the 
Jar side of the Moon, where it 
would be shielded from man- 
made interference. 

THE CHANGING STARS 

The position of a star on the 
celestial sphere is designated by 
its right ascension and declina- 
tion. The right ascensions and 
declinations of the stars change 
continually owing to a conical 
motion of the Earth’s axis in 
space called precession. The 
direction of the north celestial 
pole is not fixed but describes 
a circle of 23°. 5 in radius in a 
period of 26,000 years. Right 
now the north celestial pole is 
near Alpha Ursae Minoris, the 
star at the end of the handle 
of the Little Dipper. But by A.D. 
7500 the direction of the north 
pole will have shifted so that 
Alpha Cephei will be our Polaris, 
and around A.D. 14,000 this dis- 
tinction will fall to the bright 
star Vega. This precessional mo- 
tion of the Earth is so slow that 



it only needs to be taken into 
account in rather precise work 
If you wanted to set on a star 
tonight, and you only had its 
position for 1940, you could 
probably find it without bother- 
ing to bring its right ascension 
and declination up to date. 

But not on the Moon you 
couldn’t. The axis of the Moon 
also describes a circle in space 
with a radius of only 1°.5, in- 
stead of 23°. 5 as in the case of 
the Earth. But the lunar axis 
precesses much faster, making a 
revolution in 18J4 years instead 
of 26,000 years. As a result, lunar 
right ascensions would change at 
a terrific rate. There would be 
no trouble in calculating them 
as the problem is thoroughly un- 
derstood. It would just mean a 
little more work for the staff at 
the Naval Observatory. 

A lunar astronomical observa- 
tory has a tremendous potential. 
We have only touched upon a 
few of its major advantages. 
Now if the lunar astronomers 
can just find something to talk 
about .

DEVIL CAR 

bv ROGER ZELAZNY 



The machine was built for one deadly 
mission — a war against its own hind! 



A If urdock sped across the 
Great Western Road Plain. 

High above him the sun was 
a fiery yo-yo as he took the 
innumerable hillocks and rises 
of the Plain at better than a 
hundred-sixty miles an hour. He 
did not slow for anything, and 
Jenny’s hidden eyes spotted all 
the rocks and potholes before 
they came to them, and she care- 
fully adjusted their course, 
sometimes without his even de- 
tecting the subtle movements of 
the steering column beneath his 
hands. 

Even through the dark-tinted 
windshield and the thick goggles 
he wore, the glare from the fused 
Plain burnt into his eyes, so that 
at times it seemed as if he were 
steering a very fast boat through 



night, beneath a brilliant alien 
moon, and that he was cutting 
his way across a lake of silver 
fire. Tall dust waves rose in his 
wake, hung in the air, and after 
a time settled once more. 

“You are wearing yourself 
out,” said the radio, “sitting there 
clutching the wheel that way, 
squinting ahead. Why don’t you 
try to get some rest? Let me fog 
the shields. Go to sleep and 
leave the driving to me.” 

“No,” he said. “I want it this 
way.” 

“All right,” said Jenny. “I just 
thought I would ask.” 

“Thanks.” 

About a minute later the radio 
began playing — it was a soft, 
stringy sort of music. 

“Cut that out!” 



151 



“Sorry, boss. Thought it might 
relax you.” 

“When I need relaxing, I’ll tell 
you.” 

“Check, Sam. Sorry.” 

The silence seemed oppressive 
after its brief interruption. She 
was a good car though Murdock 
knew that. She was always con- 
cerned with his welfare, and she 
was anxious to get on with his 
quest. 

She was made to look like 
a carefree Swinger sedan: bright 
red, gaudy, fast. But there were 
rockets under the bulges of her 
hood, and two fifty-caliber muz- 
zles lurked just out of sight in 
the recesses beneath her head- 
lamps; she wore a belt of five 
and ten -second timed grenades 
across her belly: and in her 
trunk was a spray -tank contain- 
ing a highly volatile naphthalic. 

... .For his Jenny was a spe- 
cially designed deathcar, built for 
him by the Archengineer of the 
Geeyem Dynasty, far to the 
East, and all the cunning of that 
great artificer had gone into her 
construction. 

tC'IX/'e’ll find it this time, Jen- 
' * ny,” he said, “and I 
didn’t mean to snap at you like 
I did.” 

“That’s all right, Sam,” said 
the delicate voice, “1 am pro- 
grammed to understand you.” 

They roared on across the 



Great Plain and the sun fell 
away to the west. All night and 
all day they had searched, and 
Murdock was tired. The last 
Fuel Stop/Rest Stop Fortress 
seemed so long ago, so far back 

Murdock leaned forward and 
his eyes closed. 

The windows slowly darkened 
into complete opacity. The seat 
belt crept higher and drew him 
back away from the wheel. Then 
the seat gradually leaned back- 
wards until he was reclining on 
a level plane. The heater came 
on as the night approached, later. 

The seat shook him awake a 
little before five in the morning. 
“Wake up, Sam! Wake up!” 
“What is it?” he mumbled. 

“I picked up a broadcast 
twenty minutes ago. There was 
a recent car-raid out this way. 
I changed course immediately, 
and we are almost there.” 

“Why didn’t you get me up 
right away?” 

“You needed the sleep, and 
there was nothing you could do 
but get tense and nervous.” 
“Okay, you’re probably right. 
Tell me about the raid.” 

“Six vehicles, proceeding west- 
ward, were apparently ambushed 
by an undetermined number of 
wild cars sometime last night. 
The Patrol Copter was reporting 
it from above the scene and I 
listened in. All the vehicles were 



152 



GALAXY 



stripped and drained and their 
brains were smashed, and their 
passengers were all apparently 
killed too. There were no signs 
of movement.” 

“How far is it now?” 

“Another two or three min- 
utes.” 

The windshields came clear 
once more, and Murdock stared 
as far ahead throuh the night as 
the powerful lamps could cut. 

"I see something,” he said, af- 
ter a few moments. 

“This is the place,” said Jenny, 
and she began to slow down. 

They drew up beside the rav- 
aged cars. His seat belt unsnap- 
ped and the door sprang open 
on his side. 

“Circle around, Jenny,” he 
said, “and look for heat tracks. 
I won’t be long.” 

r T''he door slammed and Jenny 
moved away from him. He 
snapped on his pocket torch and 
moved toward the wrecked ve- 
hicles. 

The Plain was like a sand- 
strewn dance floor — hard and 
gritty — beneath his feet. There 
were many skid-marks, and a 
spaghetti-work of tire tracks lay 
all about the area. 

A dead man sat behind the 
wheel of the first car. His neck 
was obviously broken. The 
smashed watch on his wrist said 
2:24. There were three persons 



— two women and a young man 

— lying about forty feet away. 
They had been run down as they 
tried to flee from their assaulted 
vehicles. 

Murdock moved on, inspected 
the others. All six cars were up- 
right. Most of the damage was 
to their bodies. The tires and 
wheels had been removed from 
all of them, as well as essential 
portions of their engines; the gas 
tanks stood open, siphoned emp- 
ty; the spare tires were gone 
from the sprung trunks. There 
were no living passengers. 

Jenny pulled up beside him 
and her door opened. 

“Sam,” she said, “pull the 
brain leads on that blue car, the 
third one back. It’s still drawing 
some energy from an auxiliary 
battery, and I can hear it broad- 
casting.” 

“Okay.” 

Murdock went back and tore 
the leads free. He returned tc 
Jenny and climbed into the 
driver’s seat. 

“Did you find anything?” 

“Some traces, heading north- 
west.” 

“Follow them.” 

The door slammed and Jenny 
turned in that direction. 

They drove for about five 
minutes in silence. Then Jenny 
said: “There were eight cars in 
that convoy.” 

“What?” 



DEVIL CAR 



153 



“I just heard it on the news. 
Apparently two of the cars com- 
municated with the wild ones 
on an off-band. They threw in 
with them. They gave away their 
location and turned on the others 
at the time of the attack.” 

“What about their passen- 
gers?” 

“They probably monoed them 
before they joined the pack.” 
Murdock lit a cigarette, his 
hands shaking. 

“Jenny, what makes a car run 
wild?” he asked. “Never know- 
ing where it will get its next 
fueling — or being sure of find- 
ing spare parts for its auto-repair 
unit? Why do they do it?” 

“I do not know, Sam. I have 
never thought about it.” 

6C r T-'en years ago the Devil 
Car, their leader, killed 
my brother in a raid on his Gas 
Fortress,” said Murdock, “and 
I’ve hunted that black Caddy 
ever since. I’ve searched for it 
from the air and I’ve searched 
on foot. I’ve used other cars. I’ve 
carried heat trackers and mis- 
siles. I even laid mines. But al- 
ways it’s been too fast or too 
smart or too strong for me. Then 
I had you built.” 

“I knew you hated it very 
much. I always wondered why,” 
Jenny said. 

Murdock drew on his ciga- 
rette. 



“I had you specially program- 
med and armored and armed to 
be the toughest, fastest, smartest 
thing on wheels, Jenny. You’re 
the Scarlet Lady. You’re the one 
car can take the Caddy and his 
whole pack. You’ve got fangs 
and claws of the kind they’ve 
never met before. This time I’m 
going to get them.” 

“You could have stayed home, 
Sam, and let me do the hunt- 
ing.” 

“No. I know I could have, but 
I want to be there. I want to 
give the orders, to press some of 
the buttons myself, to watch that 
Devil Car burn away to a metal 
skeleton. How many people, how 
many cars has it smashed? We’ve 
lost count. I’ve got to get it, Jen- 

__|»J 

ny ! 

“I’ll find it for you, Sam.” 

They sped on, at around two 
hundred miles an hour. 

“How’s the fuel level, Jenny?” 

“Plenty there, and I have not 
yet drawn upon the auxiliary 
tanks. Do not worry.” 

“ — The track is getting strong- 
er,” she added. 

“Good. How’s the weapons 
system?” 

“Red light, all around. Ready 
to go.” 

Murdock snubbed out his cig- 
arette and lit another. 

“. Some of them carry dead 
people strapped inside,” said 
Murdock, “so they’ll look like 



154 



GALAXY 



decent cars with passengers. The 
black Caddy does it all the time, 
and it changes them pretty regu- 
larly. It keeps its interior re- 
frigerated — so they’ll last.” 
“You know a lot about it, 
Sam.” 

“It fooled my brother with 
phoney passengers and phoney 
plates. Got him to open his Gas 
Fortress to it that way. Then the 
whole pack attacked. It’s paint- 
ed itself red and green and blue 
and white, on different occasions, 
but it always goes back to black, 
sooner or later. It doesn’t like 
yellow or brown or two-tone. 
I’ve a list of almost every phoney 
plate it’s ever used. It’s even 
driven the big freeways right in- 
to towns and fueled up at regu- 
lar gas stops. They often get its 
number as it tears away from 
them, just as the attendant goes 
up on the driver’s side for his 
money. It can fake dozens of 
human voices. They can never 
catch it afterwards though, be- 
cause it’s souped itself up too 
well. It always makes it back 
here to the Plain and loses them. 
It’s even raided used car lots — ” 

J enny turned sharply in her 
course. 

“Sam! The trail is quite strong 
now. This way! It goes off in the 
direction of those mountains. 
“Follow!” said Murdock. 

For a long time then Murdock 



was silent. The first inklings of 
morning began in the east. The 
pale morning star was a white 
thumbtack on a blueboard be- 
hind them. They began to climb 
a gentle slope. 

“Get it, Jenny. Go get it,” 
urged Murdock. 

“I think we will,” she said. 

The angle of the slope increas- 
ed. Jenny slowed her pace to 
match the terrain, which was be- 
coming somewhat bumpy. 

“What’s the matter?” asked 
Murdock. 

“It’s harder going here,” she 
said, “also, the trail is getting 
more difficult to follow.” 

“Why is that?” 

“There is still a lot of back- 
ground radiation in these part3,” 
she told him, “and it is throwing 
off my tracking system.” 

“Keep trying, Jenny.” 

“The track seems to go straight 
toward the mountains.” 

“Follow it, follow it!” 

They slowed some more. 

“I am all fouled up now, 
Sam,” she said. “I have just lost 
the trail.” 

“It must have a stronghold 
somewhere around here — a cave 
or something like that — where 
it can be sheltered overhead. It’s 
the only way it could have es- 
caped aerial detection all these 
years.” 

“What should I do?” 

“Go as far forward as you can 



DEVIL CAR

and scan for low openings in the 
rock. Be wary. Be ready to at- 
tack in an instant.” 

They climbed into the low 
foothills, Jenny’s aerial rose high 
into the air, and the moths of 
steel cheesecloth unfolded their 
wings and danced and spun 
about it, bright there in the 
morning light 

“Nothing yet,” said Jenny, 
“and we can’t go much further.’’ 
“Then we’ll cruise along the 
length of it and keep scanning.” 
“To the right or to the left?” 
“I don’t know. Which way 
would you go if you were a rene- 
gade car on the lam?” 

“I do not know.” 

“Pick one. It doesn’t matter ” 
“To the right, then,” she said 
and they turned in that direc- 
tion, 

A fter half an hour the night 
was dropping away behind 
the mountains. To his right 
morning was exploding at the 
far end of the Plain, fracturing 
the sky into all the colors of 
autumn trees. Murdock drew a 
squeeze bottle of hot coffee, of 
the kind spacers had once used, 
from beneath the dashboard. 

“Sam, I think I have found 
something.” 

“What? Where?” 

“Ahead, to the left of '•'hat big 
boulder, a declivity with some 
kind of opening at its end.” 



“Okay, baby, make for U 
Rockets ready.” 

They pulled abreast of the 
boulder, circled around its far 
side, headed downhill. 

“A cave, or a tunnel,” he said 
“Go slow — ” 

“Heat! Heat!” she said. “I’m 
tracking again!” 

“I can even see tire marks, 
lots of them!” said Murdock 
“This is it!” 

They moved toward the open 
ing. 

“Go in, but go slowly,” he or- 
dered. “Blast the first thing that 
moves.” 

They entered the rocky portal, 
moving on sand now. Jenny turn- 
ed off her visible lights and 
switched to infra-red. An i-r lens 
rose before the windshield, and 
Murdock studied the cave. It 
was about twenty feet high and 
wide enough to accommoda':'' 
perhaps three cars going abreast 
The floor changed from sand to 
rock, but it was smooth and 
fairly level. After a time it 
sloped upward. 

"There’s some light ahead, ’ 
he whispered. 

“I know.” 

“A piece of the sky, I think ” 

They crept toward it, Jenny’s 
engine but the barest sigh with 
in the great chambers of rock 

They stopped at the threshold 
to the light. The i-r shield drop- 
ped again.

GALAXY 



It was a sand-and-shale can- 
yon that he looked upon. Huge 
slantings and overhangs of rock 
hid all but the far end from any 
eye in the sky. The light was 
pale at the far end, and there 
was nothing unusual beneath it. 

But nearer . 

Murdock blinked. 

XT earer, in the dim light of 
^ ^ morning and in the shadows, 
stood the greatest junkheap 
Murdock had ever seen in his 
life. 

Pieces of cars, of every make 
and model, were heaped into a 
small mountain before him. 
There were batteries and tires 
and cables and shock absorbers; 
there were fenders and bumpers 
and headlamps and headlamp 
housings; there were doors and 
windshields and cylinders and 
pistons, carbureators, generators, 
voltage regulators, and oil pumps. 

Murdock stared. 

“Jenny,” he whispered, “we’ve 
found the graveyard of the 
autos!” 

A very old car, which Mur- 
dock had not even distinguished 
from the junk during that first 
glance, jerked several feet in 
their direction and stopped as 
suddenly. The sound of rivet 
heads scoring ancient brake 
drums screeched in his ears. Its 
tires were completely bald, and 
the left front one was badly in 



need of air. Its right front head- 
lamp was broken and there was 
a crack in its windshield. It 
stood there before the heap, its 
awakened engine making a er- 
rible rattling noise. 

“What’s happening?” asked 
Murdock. “What is it?” 

“He is talking to me,” said 
Jenny. “He is very old. His 
speedometer has been all the 
way around so many times that 
he forgets the number of miles 
he has seen. He hates people, 
whom he says have abused him 
whenever they could. He is the 
guardian of the graveyard. He 
is too old to go raiding any more, 
so he has stood guard over the 
spare parts heap for many years. 
He is not the sort who 'an re- 
pair himself, as the younger ones 
do, so he must rely on their 
charity and their auto- repair 
units. He wants to know what I 
want here.” 

“Ask him where the others 
are.” 

But as he said it, Murdock 
heard the sound of many engines 
turning over, until the valley 
was filled with the thunder of 
their horsepower. 

“They are parked on the other 
side of the heap,” she said. 
“They are coming now.” 

“Hold back until I tell you to 
fire,” said Murdock, as the first 
car — a sleek yellow Chrysler — 
nosed around the heap. 



DEVIL CAR 



157 



Murdock lowered his head to 
the steering wheel, but kept his 
eyes open behind his goggles. 

“Tell them that you came here 
to join the pack and that you’ve 
monoed your driver. Try to get 
the black Caddy to come into 
range.” 

“He will not do it,” she said. 
“I am talking with him now He 
can broadcast just as easily from 
the other side of the pile, and he 
says he is sending the six biggest 
members of his pack to guard 
me while he decides what to do. 
He has ordered me to leave the 
tunnel and pull ahead into the 
valley.” 

“Go ahead then — slowly.” 

They crept forward. 

'T'wo Lincolns, a powerful- 
looking Pontiac, and two 
Mercs joined the Chrysler — 
three on each side of them, in 
position to ram. 

“Has he given you any idea 
how many there are on the other 
side?” 

“No. I asked, but he will not 
tell me.” 

“Well, we’ll just have to wait 
then.” 

He stayed slumped, pretend- 
ing to be dead. After a time, his 
already tired shoulders began to 
ache. Finally, Jenny spoke: 

“He wants me to pull around 
the far end of the pile,” she said, 
“now that they have cleared the 



way, and to head into a gap in 
the rock which he will indicate. 
He wants to have his auto-mech 
go over me.” 

“We can’t have that,” said 
Murdock, “but head around the 
pile. I’ll tell you what to do 
when I’ve gotten a glimpse of 
the other side.” 

The two Mercs and the Big 
Chief drew aside and Jenny 
crept past them. Murdock stared 
upwards from the corner of his 
eye, up at the towering mound 
of junk they were passing. A 
couple well-placed rockets on 
either end could topple it, but 
the auto-mech would probably 
clear it eventually. 

They rounded the lefthand 
end of the pile. 

Something like forty-five cars 
were facing them at about a 
hundred-twenty yards’ distance, 
to the right and ahead. They had 
fanned out. They were blocking 
the exit around the other end of 
the pile, and the six guards in 
back of him now blocked the 
way behind Murdock. 

On the far side of the farthest 
rank of the most distant cars an 
ancient black Caddy was park- 
ed. 

It had been beaten forth from 
assembly during a year when 
the apprentice-engineers were 
indeed thinking big. Huge it was, 
and shiny, and a skeleton’s face 
smiled from behind its wheel. 



158 



GALAXY 



Black it was, and gleaming 
chromium, and its headlamps 
were like dusky jewels or the 
eyes of insects. Every plane and 
curve shimmered with power, 
and its great fishtailed rear end 
seemed ready to slap at the sea 
of shadows behind it on an in- 
stant’s notice, as it sprang for- 
ward for its kill. 

“That’s it!” whispered Mur- 
dock. “The Devil Car!” 

“He is big!” said Jenny. “I 
have never seen a car that big!” 
They continued to move for- 
ward. 

“He wants me to head into 
that opening and park,” she said. 

“Head toward it, slowly. But 
don’t go into it,” said Murdock 

HPhey turned and inched to- 
ward the opening. The other 
cars stood, the sounds of their 
engines rising and falling. 

“Check all weapons system.” 
“Red, all around.” 

. The opening was twenty-five 
feet away. 

“When I say ‘now’, go into 
neutral steer and turn one hun- 
dred-eighty degrees — fast, They 
can’t be expecting that. They 
don’t have it themselves. Then 
open up with the fifty-calibers 
and fire your rockets at the Cad- 
dy, turn at a right angle and 
start back the way we came, 
and spray the naphtha as we go, 
and fire on the six guards . , 



“Now!” he cried, leaping up in 
his seat. 

He was slammed back as they 
spun, and he heard the chatter- 
ing of her guns before his head 
cleared. By then, flames were 
leaping up in the distance. 

Jenny’s guns were extruded 
now and turning on their mounts, 
spraying the line of vehicles 
with hundreds of leaden ham- 
mers. She shook, twice, as she 
discharged two rockets from be- 
neath her partly opened hood. 
Then they were moving forward, 
and eight or nine of the cars were 
rushing downhill toward them. 

She turned again in neutral 
steer and sprang back in the 
direction from which they had 
come, around the southeast cor- 
ner of the pile. Her guns were 
hammering at the now retreating 
guards, and in the wide rear 
view mirror Murdock could see 
that a wall of flame was tower- 
ing high behind them. 

“You missed it!” he cried. 
“You missed the black Caddy! 
Your rockets hit the cars in front 
of it and it backed off!” 

“I know! I’m sorry!” 

“You had a clear shot!” 

“I know! I missed!” 

They rounded the pile just as 
two of the guard cars vanished 
into the tunnel. Three more lay 
in smoking ruin. The sixth had 
evidently preceded the other two 
out through the passage. 



DEVIL CAR 



159 



"Here it comes now!” cried 
Murdock. "Around the other end 
of the pile! Kill it! Kill it!” 
The ancient guardian of the 
graveyard — it looked like a 
Ford, but he couldn’t be sure — 
moved forward with a dreadful 
chattering sound and interposed 
itself in the line of fire. 

“My range is blocked.” 

tcQmash that junkheap and 
cover the tunnel! Don’t let 
the Caddy escape!” 

“I can’t!” she said. 

“Why not?” 

“I just can’t l” 

“That’s an order! Smash it 
and cover the tunnel!” 

Her guns swivelled and she 
shot out the tires beneath the 
ancient car. 

The Caddy shot past and into 
the passageway. 

“You let it get by!” he scream- 
ed. “Get after it!” 

“All right, Sam! I’m doing it! 
Don’t yell. Please don’t yell!” 

She headed for the tunnel. In- 
side, he could hear the sound of 
a giant engine racing away, 
growing softer in the distance. 

“Don’t fire here in the tun- 
nel! If you hit it we may be 
bottled in!” 

“I know. I won’t.” 

“Drop a couple ten-second 
grenades and step on the gas 
Maybe we can seal in whatever’s 
left moving back there.” 

150 



Suddenly they shot ahead and 
emerged into daylight. There 
was no sign of any other vehicle 
about. 

“Find its track,” he said, “and 
start chasing it.” 

There was an explosion up the 
hill behind him, within the moun- 
tain. The ground trembled, then 
it was still once more. 

“There are so many tracks 
. .” she said. 

“You know the one I want. 
The biggest, the widest, the hot- 
test! Find it! Run it down!” 

“I think I have it, Sam.” 
“Okay. Proceed as rapidly as 
possible for this terrain.” 

Murdock found a squeeze bot- 
tle of bourbon and took three 
gulps. Then he lit a cigarette 
and glared into the distance. 

“Why did you miss it?” he 
asked softly “Why did you miss 
it, Jenny?” 

She did not answer immedi- 
ately. He waited. 

TT'inally, “Because he is not an 
‘it’ to me,” she said. “He has 
done much damage to cars and 
people, and that is terrible. But 
there is something about him, 
something — noble. The way he 
has fought the whole world for 
his freedom, Sam, keeping that 
pack of vicious machines in line, 
stopping at nothing to maintain 
himself that way — without a 
master — for as long as he can 



GALAXY 



remain unsmashed, unbeaten — 
Sam, for a moment back there I 
wanted to join his pack, to run 
with him across the Great Road 
Plains, to use my rockets against 
the gates of the Gas Forts for 
him . But I could not mono 
you, Sam. I was built for you. 
I am too domesticated. I am too 
weak. I could not shoot him 
though, and I misfired the rock- 
ets on purpose. But I could nev- 
er mono you, Sam, really.” 
“Thanks,” he said, “you over- 
programmed ashcan. Thanks a 
lot!” 

“I am sorry, Sam.” 

“Shut up — No, don’t, not yet. 
First tell me what you’re going 
to do if we find ‘him’.” 

“I don’t know.” 

“Well think it over fast. You 
see that dust cloud ahead as well 
as I do, and you’d better speed 
up.” 

They shot forward. 

“Wait till I call Detroit. 
They’ll laugh themselves silly, 
till I claim the refund.” 

“I am not of inferior construc- 
tion or design. You know that. I 
am just more . 

“ ‘Emotional’,” supplied Mur- 
dock. 

“. Than I thought i would 
be,” she finished. “I had not real- 
ly met many cars, except for 
young ones, before I was ship- 
ped to you. I did not know what 
a wild car was like, and I had 



never smashed any cars before 
— just targets and things like 
that. I was young and . .” 

“ ‘Innocent’,” said Murdock. 
“Yeah. Very touching. Get ready 
to kill the next car we meet. If 
it happens to be your boyfriend 
and you hold your fire, then he’ll 
kill us.” 

“I will try, Sam.” 

The car ahead had stopped. It 
was the yellow Chrysler. Two of 
its tires had gone flat and it was 
parked, lopsided, waiting. 

“Leave it!” snarled Murdock, 
as the hood clicked open. “Save 
the ammo for something that 
might fight back.” 

They sped past it. 

“Did it say anything?” 
“Machine profanity,” she said. 
“I’ve only heard it once or twice, 
and it would be meaningless to 
you.” 

T T e chuckled. “Cars actually 
swear at each other?” 
“Occasionally,” she said. “I 
imagine the lower sort indulge 
in it more frequently, especially 
on freeways and turnpikes when 
they become congested.” 

“Let me hear a machine 
swear-word.” 

“I will not. What kind of car 
do you think I am, anyway?” 
“I’m sorry,” said Murdock. 
“You’re a lady. I forgot.” 

There was an audible dick 
within the radio. 



DEVIL CAR

They raced forward on the 
level ground that lay before the 
foot of the mountains. Murdock 
took another drink, then switch- 
ed to coffee. 

“Ten years,” he muttered, ‘ten 
years . .” 

The trail swung in a wide 
curve as the mountains jogged 
back and the foothills sprang up 
high beside them. 

It was over almost before he 
knew it. 

As they passed a huge, orange- 
colored stone massif, sculpted 
like an upside-down toadstool 
by the wind, there was a clearing 
to the right. 

It shot forward at them — the 
Devil Car. It had lain in am- 
bush, seeing that it could not 
outrun the Scarlet Lady, and it 
rushed toward a final collision 
with its hunter. 

Jenny skidded sideways as her 
brakes caught with a scream and 
a smell of smoke, and her fifty- 
calibers were firing, and her 
hood sprang open and her front 
wheels rose up off the ground as 
the rockets leapt wailing ahead, 
and she spun around three 
times, her rear bumper scraping 
the saltsand plain, and the third 
and last time she fired her re- 
maining rockets into the smoul- 
dering wreckage on the hillside, 
and she came to a rest on all 
four wheels; and her fifty-cali- 
bers kept firing until they were 



emptied, and then a steady 
clicking sound came from them 
for a full minute afterwards, and 
then all lapsed into silence. 

Murdock sat there shaking, 
watching the gutted, twisted 
wreck blaze against the morning 
sky. 

“You did it, Jenny. You kill- 
ed him. You killed me the Devil 
Car,” he said. 

But she did not answer him. 
Her engine started once more 
and she turned toward the south- 
east and headed for the Fuel 
Stop/Rest Stop Fortress that lay 
in that civilized direction. 

T? or two hours they drove in 
silence, and Murdock drank 
all his bourbon and all his coffee 
and smoked all his cigarettes. 

“Jenny, say something,” he 
said. “What’s the matter? Tell 
me.” 

There was a click, and her 
voice was very soft: 

“Sam — he talked to me as 
he came down the hill . .” she 
said. 

Murdock waited, but she did 
not say anything else. 

“Well, what did he say?” he 
asked. 

“He said, ‘Say you will mono 
your passenger and I will swerve 
by you’,” she told him. “He 
said, ‘I want you, Scarlet Lady 
— to run with me, to raid with 
me. Together they will never 



162 



GALAXY 



catch us,’ and I killed him.” 
Murdock was silent. 

“He only said that co delay 
my firing though, did he not? 
He said that to stop me, so that 
he could smash us both when 
he went smash himself, did he 
not? He could not have meant 
it, could he, Sam?” 

“Of course not,” said Mur- 
dock, “of course not. It was too 
late for him to swerve.” 

“ Y es, I suppose it was — do 
you think though, that he really 
wanted me to run with him, to 



raid with him — before every- 
thing, I mean — back there?” 
“Probably, baby. You’re pret- 
ty well-equipped.” 

“Thanks,” she said, and turn- 
ed off again. 

Before she did though, he 
heard a strange mechanical 
sound, falling into the rhythms 
of profanity or prayer. 

Then he shook his head and 
lowered it, softly patting the seat 
beside him with his still un- 
steady hand.

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 






A s you know, the essential 
conflict is between comfort- 
able ignorance and pitiless intel- 
ligence. But it ramifies, and there 
are days when a man hardly 
knows how much of himself is 
on which side. Complicating the 
whole thing is this Heaven-sent 
gift of self-consciousness which 
distinguishes Man from the ma- 
jor life-forms so that a man may 
sit behind a machine writing 
words which are either pro- or 
anti-machine, realize what he is 
doing, and sit there blushing. 
And, being reasonable, we also 
realize that the truth is almost 
certainly staked out somewhere 
between the fortress of reaction 
spangled with the latest tech- 
nological gimcrackery, and the 
shabby haven of the thinking 
wanderer whose favorite victim 
is himself. 

In that No Man’s Land, 
science fiction writers of both 



sides meet in dim grapple with- 
out friend or foe. And if you 
think there is poetry in that, 
friend, then you have your first 
affair with Truth yet before you. 

But we were discussing books 

“Davy,” Theodore Sturgeon 
said in his piece on this book 
for the National Review, “is a 
— .” The staff of that journal cut 
the noun out, as did the staff 
of this one, and what remains of 
Sturgeon’s Opinion can be found 
on the back of the reprint edi- 
tion which has now come out 
(Ballantine Book #U6018, 75c, 
paper, by Edgar Pangborn) : “A 
lovely book, a rollicking book, a 
candenced, surprising, provoca- 
tive and musical book.” The 
South Bend Tribune compares it 
to Tom Jones and notes its “ex- 
pert probing of the deepest and 
darkest areas of life — the sexual 



164 



and the tragic,” a quote deserv- 
ing of inscription on tablets of 
mud. 

What the book is is an auto- 
biographical journal, by Davy 
with footnotes by assorted 
friends, of a young man’s pro- 
gress in the dark years of the 
Northeastern United States some 
centuries after a nuclear cata- 
clysm which in some way dras- 
tically changed sea level and 
climate, while also wiping out 
civilization and leaving an in- 
heritance of frequent mutant 
births. Because the climate is 
warm, loin cloths and loin cloth 
humor are standard. Because the 
times are barbaric, with New 
England split up into half a doz- 
en nations of which the most 
advanced are just experimenting 
with feudalism, the social milieu 
is overtly puritanical, actually 
gross, and thus bawdy. Because 
the hero is a vigorous adolescent 
male, some of the crucial events 
in the book are sexual adven- 
tures. So much for the deepest 
and darkest areas of life. 

Pangborn has done a rare and 
wonderful thing — a thing peo- 
ple are always wanting science 
fiction to have — in creating a 
believable, impressive, vivid and 
memorable character. Davy over- 
shadows his adventures by a 
considerable margin as he moves 
from his dubious past into his 
unknown but glorious future. I 



have no idea how female readers 
will react to him, but there is 
little doubt in my mind that 
males are delighted to identify 
with him, and not simply be- 
cause he is such a marvelous 
stud and an instinctive French 
horn player besides. He is a man 
of simple needs and reactions but 
complicated motives, on the side 
of Light. In his prime, he is ac- 
tively associated with an attempt 
to restore reason to a culture 
ruled by a repressive Church. 

What seems not to have oc- 
curred to many people — and 
you may be assured Pangborn 
has again scored a terrific suc- 
cess d’estime — is that this book 
achieves its marvelous effects by 
talking tough while following 
faithfully along a line of beloved 
cliches. Some of these charming 
conventions are sketched in or 
thrown away as the book begins 
to show traces of running over- 
length, but all of them are 
scrupulously registered with the 
reader. And what these cliches 
are — from the acquisition of the 
golden horn through the bastard 
Davy’s discovery of his father 
to the vengeance Fate exacts in 
payment for the horn, and that 
scene in which a slim, handsome 
youth reveals himself to be a 
girl in disguise — are the cliches 
of the self-confident Establish- 
ment tickling itself. It occurs 
to me that either Richard Wag- 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



165 



ner or Gilbert and Sullivan 
could have used this libretto, 
and have, creating delicious, 
totally acceptable entertainment 
around characters and events 
which would actually have made 
the audience run in panic 

There are many deep and 
tragic events in Davy’s life, true. 
There are deep and tragic events 
in Davy’s world. They occur off- 
stage or are stamped in crucial 
detail as they occur The at- 
tempt to revive civilization, the 
death of Davy’s love, the civil 
war in which the Church takes 
back its hold on society ... all 
are tags for Davy’s highly per- 
sonalized and severely restricted 
narrative. 

To the end, Davy remains the 
rebel who never threatens. His 
true subversions are carried on 
out of sight. Though you cer- 
tainly wouldn’t want him alone 
in the parlor with your daugh- 
ter. he would make a titillating 
guest at a dinner party, castrated 
as he is by his inability to sire 
viable children, a trifle savage, 
of course, and, all in all, just 
the perfect cheap thrill. 

Now, you may make of that 
remark what you will. (It hor- 
rifies me). On the top of my 
head, I find a high opinion of 
Davy and a continuing high 
opinion of Pangborn which will 
not be altered by anything I 
think of this particular book. For 



the record, the book moved me, 
to the point where for some 
time 1 was completely separated 
from any reality of my own. I’m 
convinced most people wil! like 
the book very much and may 
re-read it I’m sure they’ll offer 
it to friends as an example of 
outstanding work in the field. 
I’ve turned several people on to 
it myself. But I wonder ... I 
wonder 

The Rest of the Robots, Isaac 
Asimov, Doubleday and Com- 
pany, Inc., 556 pp., $5.95, is in- 
troduced as the companion vol- 
ume to Asimov’s much earlier I , 
Robot. It is that — a great omni- 
bus volume containing eight 
short stories and the complete 
novels The Caves of Steel and 
The Naked Sun. It is also a sort 
of memorial to Isaac, containing 
much marginal notation by the 
author, plus a statement of pur- 
pose and an afterword in which 
Asimov explains that there is 
still one novel needed to finish 
his total statement about robots, 
but that he has been unable to 
work on any fiction of conse- 
quence since the summer of 1958. 
When I say “memorial,” in oth- 
er words, I’m echoing the mood 
of this book, which is more that 
of a scholarly attempt to achieve 
definition of a completed career 
— or a permanently interrupted 
one — than it is that of a book 



166 



GALAXY 



of entertainment. It is a fine 
book of entertainment, by the 
way, and if you have any sort 
of permanent library at all, this 
is your next need in that line. 

This growing practice of hav- 
ing story collections include 
voluminous notes by the author 
is beginning to wear on me. If 
the man is alive, the presump- 
tion is that these stories are new 
to the reader and will do their 
own ingratiating. If the man is 
dead, let someone else explain 
the meaning of this material 
which is now obviously being 
packaged for what it can be used 
for, not for what it is. In the 
case of this book, the effect is 
particularly unfortunate, since it 
sucks the juice out of some very 
vivacious writing indeed, and 
embalms one of science fiction’s 
most ebullient personalities. A 
man should not declaim at his 
own funeral, not even if he does 
hope to be back from science 
writing someday. 

Well, however that may be, I 
heartily recommend this book 
and its author. I hope Double- 
day’s editorial policies are pay- 
ing off in wide sales beyond 
science fiction in-group. 

Robert F. Young is one of 
those writers who now and then 
produces a memorable and 
much-discussed story, but is not 
generally considered a top-rank 



man as yet When I say “much- 
discussed,” by the way, I ob- 
viously have to mean that the 
editor who buys it brags about 
it, and other writers talk about 
it in bull sessions after it comes 
out. Hardly anyone knows what 
the readers think, any more. 

One of these “in” stories was 
Goddess in Granite, the star 
item in The Worlds of Robert 
F. Young, a collection published 
by Simon & Schuster at $3.95 
with an introduction which is 
really an expanded F&SF blurb 
by Avram Davidson. Goddess is 
poignant, relentless, and heavily 
evocative, purporting to be about 
a man climbing an alien moun- 
tain which a lost race long ago 
carved into the shape of a giant 
sleeping nude woman. It is so 
effective that it led to at least 
one autoderivative story about a 
man climbing a giant tree. Etc. 

The other fifteen stories in this 
volume illustrate Young’s more 
usual concerns, which made him 
a frequent contributor to If 
when, in an earlier incarnation, 
it propagandized heavily for 
“humanism” via sometimes pain- 
fully explicit attacks on techno- 
logy as the enemy of the soul. 
Some rather good work came 
out of that now pinched-off 
pocket universe, and Young was 
one of the top operators in that 
genre. Simon & Schuster having 
neglected to give the magazine 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF

copyright notices, I cannot tell 
you how many of the stories are 
from that time. But many are 
from that school. Those which 
are not, tend to be piffle; the 
best example anyone would need 
of this is Written in the Stars, 
for which some special award 
should go to the various editors 
who have at least had the grace 
not to brag. 

The collection balances more 
toward the piffling and the pro- 
pagandists tli a -i it does to the 
compelling. There is reason to 
believe Young wants it that way, 
which is all right as long as he 
can walk the very fine dividing 
line between effective emotiona- 
lism and the ludicrous. I would 
wait for the paperback before at- 
tempting to reach my own eval- 
uation, if I were you. 

In sometimes contentious com- 
pany with Damon Knight, Wil- 
liam Atheling, Jr. was the science 
fiction critic who transformed 
the reviewer’s trade in this field. 
Knight, of course, did most of 
his work in the prozines, one 
assumes for money and free 
books as a consequence of his 
love, whereas Atheling’s commen- 
tary, often reviewing the pro- 
zines themselves appeared in 
such amateur journals as Sky- 
hook and Axe. Advent; Publish- 
ers, P. O. Box 9228, Chicago, 
Illinois 60690, have thus pro- 



duced the perfect complement to 
their prize-winning earlier com- 
pilation of Knight. The Issue at 
Hand, by William Atheling, Jr. 
edited and with an introduction 
by James Blish, ($5.00, 136 pp. 
with index, hardbound), is the 
definitive Atheling — acidulous, 
assertive, categorical, conscien- 
tious and occasionally idiosyn- 
cratic. It subjects individual 
magazine stories to a species of 
analysis-in-depth for which I am 
sure their writers never bargain- 
ed, but which possibly left some 
of them better men. The as- 
sumption has to be that the 
clods were beyond redemption in 
any case, and that the occasional 
wounded cries were symptoma- 
tic of a healthy catharsis. 

No bones are made about 
Atheling having been Blish all 
along, even when he was dis- 
secting Blish. This kind of thing 
is from an earlier, happier time 
in the field, he said sententious- 
ly. In those days — a handful of 
years ago — the perfectability of 
science fiction was the basic as- 
sumption underlying the work 
of a handful of brilliant dedica- 
ted men who rejected “main- 
stream” literary conventions in 
favor of classical literary pre- 
cepts. They may have been 
right; certainly, they gave the 
field a push in a fruitful direc- 
tion, and some of us will cer- 
tainly never be the same. Their 



168 



GALAXY 



approach was almost exclusive- 
ly destructive — disclaimers to 
the contrary — and there is just 
so much of this the climate will 
tolerate. But there was a lot to 
destroy, and there is this much 
about an encounter with the piti- 
less — one rapidly discovers just 
what a balloon of fat one is 
carrying around one’s indestruc- 
tible core, assuming one has such 
a thing at all. 

The publishers offer this book 
in curious wise: “Virtually the 
single most necessary text for 
would-be writers, in or out of 
the science fiction field.” This 
is horsefeather of purest ray 
serene; it will undoubtedly do a 
great many things for and to the 
psyches of would-be writers who 
suspect another Atheling in the 
offing, but it will not teach an 
unprofessional the first thing 
about writing. What it will teach 
him — but of course, this is not a 



selling point — is what discipline 
of the intelligence can be, and 
how it was once applied to one 
species of literary product. 
From this, the reader may 
emerge a more illuminated man, 
and from that he may become a 
more purposeful and valuable 
writer, but the odds are not fav- 
orable. God produces many 
more victims than he does Athe- 
lings. 

Perhaps because we all know 
this, The Issue at Hand is best 
read as a work of entertainment. 
As a work of entertainment, it 
has only one peer in its genre, 
and I most earnestly urge that 
you place your order with the 
publishers; asking your local 
bookstore to order it for you will 
result in confusion and delay, 
which you will resent after dis- 
covering what a superbly enter- 
taining book this book is.

Illustrated by MODEL 



They thought they were marooned 
light-years from home — but the 
truth was far worse than thatl 



I 

\ n alarm rang, like an old- 
fashioned air-raid siren. The 
deep voice of the Brain blared, 
“Strac Astrophysics is not in his 
cabin! Strac Astrophysics, report 
to your cabin immediately! The 
Hogan's Goat will Jump in sixty 
seconds.” 

Verd tensed. He had to re- 
strain an urge to get up. In near- 
ly two centuries of piloting the 



Hogan’s Goat, Verd had never 
lost a passenger through care- 
lessness. Passengers were sup- 
posed to be careless. If Strac 
didn’t reach his room Verd 
would have to postpone Jump 
to save his life: a serious breach 
of the customs of travel. 

Above the green coffin which 
was his Jump couch the Brain 
said, “Strac Astrophysics is in 
his cabin and protected.” 

Verd relaxed. 



171 



“Five.” said the Brain. “Four. 
Three . 

In various parts of the ship, 
twenty-eight bodies jerked like 
springs released. “Oof,” com- 
plained Lourdi, lying in the 
Jump couch next to Verd’s. 
“That felt strange.” Lourdi was 
Verd’s wife, a mixture of many 
races and subdivisions of Man, 
bearing the delicate, willowy, 
beauty born of low gravity 
worlds. She was an experienced 
traveler. When she sat up in her 
green coffin she looked puzzled. 

“I’ve never felt anything like 
that before. Have you, dear?” 
she asked. 

Verd grunted as he climbed 
out. He was a few pounds over- 
weight. His face was beefy, 
smooth and unlined and fashion- 
ably hairless. So was his scalp, 
except for a narrow strip of black 
brush which ran straight up from 
between his brow ridges and con- 
tinued on until it faded out near 
the small of his back. Most of 
the hair had been cosmetically 
implanted. Neither wrinkles nor 
width of hair strip could tell a 
man’s age, and superficially 
Verd might have been anywhere 
from twenty to four hundred 
years old. It was in his economy 
of movement that Verd’s age 
showed. He did things the easy 
way, the fast way. He never 
needed more than seconds to 
find it, and he always took that 



time. He had had a long time 
to learn. 

“No,” said Verd. “Let’s find 
out what it was. Brain!” he 
snapped at the wall speaker. 

The silence stretched like a 
nerve. 

“Brain?” 

V erd Spacercaptain, Lourdi 
Coursefinder, and Parliss 
Lifesystems sat along one wall 
of the crew common room, 
watching the fourth member of 
the crew. Chanda Thinkersyst 
was a tall, homely woman whose 
major beauty was her wavy 
black hair. A strip two inches 
wide down the center of her 
scalp had been allowed to grow 
until it hung to the region of her 
coccyx, satin black and satin 
soft, gleaming and rippling as 
she moved. She stood before the 
biggest of the Brain screens, 
which now showed a diagram of 
the Hogan's Goat, and she used 
her finger as a pointer. 

“The rock hit here,” she said, 
pointing halfway back on the 
spinal maze of lines and little 
black squares and lighted power- 
source symbols which represent- 
ed the Jumper machinery. “It 
must have been there when we 
came out of overspace, so the 
meteor gun never got the chance 
to stop it. It burned through the 
Jumper and lost most of its 
mass in the hull. What was left 



172 



GALAXY 



lined droplets of high-speed 
molten metal all through the 
chip’s Brain.” 

Parliss whistled. He was tall, 
ash blond and very young. 
“That’ll soften it up,” he mur- 
mured irreverently. He winced 
at Chanda’s glare and added, 
“Sorry.” 

Chanda went on. “Of course 
there’s no chance of repairing 
the Brain ourselves. There were 
too many points of injury, and 
most of them too small to find. 
The Brain can still solve prob- 
lems and obey orders. The worst 
problem seems to be this motor 
aphasia, and I’ve circumvented 
that by instructing the Brain 
to use Morse code. Since I don’t 
know the extent of the damage 
very precisely, I recommend we 
let a tug land the passengers on 
Earth instead of trying to land 
the Goat.” 

Verd cringed at the thought 
of what the tug captains would 
say. “All right. Chanda, what is 
Morse code?” 

Chanda smiled. “Morse is 
English translated into dots and 
dashes. It was one of the first 
things I tried. I didn’t really ex- 
pect it to work, and I doubt if 
it would on a human patient.” 

“Thanks, Chanda.” Verd stood 
up and the Brain doctor sat 
down. “All I will have to say, 
group, is that we’re going to 
take a bad loss this trip. The 



Brain is sure to need expensive 
repairs, and it looks to me like 
the Jumper will have to be al- 
most completely torn out. It 
gave one awful discharge when 
the meteor hit, and most of the 
parts are fused — Lourdi, what’s 
wrong? We can afford it.” 

Lourdi shook her head. Her 
delicate surgeon’s fingers grip- 
ped hard at the arms of her 
chair. 

“Why not?” Verd asked gen- 
tly. “We land on Earth and take 
a vacation while the orbital re- 
pair companies do the worrying.” 
Lourdi Coursefinder gulped 
air before she could speak. 
“We’ll have to do the worrying, 
dear,” she said brightly. “I 
couldn’t ask the Brain to do it, 
so I used the telescope myself. 
That’s not Sol.” 

The others looked at her. 
“It’s not the Sun. It’s a green- 
ish-white dwarf, a dead star. I 
couldn’t find the Sun.” 

II 

/"Vnce it had its orders, the 
Brain was much faster with 
the telescope than Lourdi. It 
confirmed her description of the 
star which was where Sol should 
have been, and added that it 
was no star in the Brain’s cata- 
logue. Furthermore the Brain 
could not recognize the volume 
of space around it. It was still 



174 



GALAXY 



scanning star.;, hoping to find its 
bearings. 

They sat in the crew common 
room drinking droobleberry juice 
and vodka. 

The two dozen passengers had 
been told nothing as yet, but 
they must have been getting 
restless. Interstellar law gave 
each passenger access at all 
times to the ship’s Brain. Some- 
one must know by now that the 
Brain was incommunicado. 

Lourdi stopped making rings 
on the tabletop. “Chanda, will 
you translate for me?” 

Chanda looked up hopefully. 
“Of course.” 

“Ask the Brain to find the 
planet in this system which most 
resembles Saturn.” 

“Saturn?” Chanda’s homely 
face lost its hopeful expression. 
She turned to the Brain speaker 
and tapped next to it with a 
stylus. 

Almost immediately a line of 
■hort and long white lines began 
moving left to right across the 
top of the Brain screen. The 
screen itself went white, cleared, 
showing what looked like a pic- 
ture of Saturn. But there were 
too many gaps in the ring, and 
they were too well defined. 
Chanda said. “Fifth major planet 
from star. Six moons. Period, 
29.46 years. Distance from Sun: 
9.54 a. u. Diameter: 72,000 miles. 
Tyne gas giant. So?” 



Lourdi nodded to herself. Verd 
and Parliss were watching her. 
“Ask it to show us the second 
and third planets.” 

The second planet was in its 
quarter phase. The Brain screen 
showed it looking like a large 
Moon, but less badly pocked, 
and with one major difference: 
an intensely bright area across 
the middle. Chanda translated 
the marching dots: “Distance 

1.18 a. u. Period 401.4. Diameter 
7918 miles. No moon. No air.” 
The third planet — “That’s 
Mars!” said Lourdi. 

It was. 

And the second planet was 
Earth. 

“T believe I now know what 
A has happened,” said Verd, 
speaking very loudly. Twenty- 
seven faces looked back at him 
across the dining room. He was 
addressing crew and passengers, 
and he had to address them in 
person, for the Brain could no 
longer repeat his words over the 
speakers in the rooms. Verd dis- 
covered that he did not like pub- 
lic speaking. 

“You know that a Jumper 
creates an overspace in which 
the speed of light becomes in- 
finite in a neighborhood of the 
ship. “When—” 

“Almost infinite,” said a pas- 
senger. 

“That’s a popular misconcep- 

175 



ONE FACE 



tion,” Verd snapped. With an ef- 
fort he resumed his speaking 
voice. “The speed of light goes 
all the way to infinity. If it 
weren’t for the braking spines, 
which keep our speed finite by 
projecting almost into normal 
space, we’d wind up by going 
simultaneous — being every- 
where at once. The braking 
spines are those things that point 
out from the girdle of the ship. 

“Well, there was a rock in our 
way, inside the range of the 
meteor gun, when the Jumper 
went off. It went through the 
Jumper and into the Brain. 

“The damage it did to our 
Brain is secondary. Something 
happened to the Jumper while 
the rock was in there. Maybe 
some metal vaporized and 
caused a short circuit. Anyway 
the Goat jumped back into over- 
space in the other direction. The 
speed of light went to zero 

“The braking spines stuck out, 
or we wouldn’t have come out 
until the bitter end of time. Well, 
then. In a region around the 
ship, the speed of light was zero. 
Our mass was infinite, our clocks 
and hearts stopped, the ship be- 
came an infinitesimally thin disc. 
This state lasted for no time — 
in ship’s time. But when it end- 
ed several billion years had pass- 
ed.” 

A universal gasp, and then 
pandemonium. 



“Billion?” “Kdapt stomp it—” 
“Oh, my God!” “Practical joke, 
Marna. I must say — ” “Shut up 
and let him finish.” 

The shouting died away. A last 

voice shouted, “But if our mass 
» 

“Only in a region around the 
ship!” Verd recognized the man; 
it was Strac Astrophysics. 

“Oh,” said Strac, apparently 
shrugging off a picture of suns 
and galaxies snatched brutally 
down upon his cringing head by 
the Goat's infinite gravity. 

ttnphe zero effect has been 
* used before,” Verd con- 
tinued. “For suspended anima- 
tion, for very long range time 
capsules, et cetera. But it has 
never happened to a spacecraft, 
to my knowledge. Our position is 
very bad. The Sun has become 
a greenish-white dwarf. The 
Earth has lost all its air and has 
become a one-face world. Like 
Mercury, it no longer rotates. 
Mercury isn’t there any more. 
Neither is the Moon. 

“You can forget the idea of 
going home, and say good-by to 
anyone you knew outside this 
ship. This is the universe, our- 
selves and nobody else, and our 
only duty is to survive. We will 
keep you informed of develop- 
ments. Anyone who wishes his 
passage money refunded is wel- 
come to it.” 



176 



GALAXY 



In a crackle of weak, grave- 
yard laughter, Verd bobbed his 
head in dismissal. 

The passengers weren’t taking 
the hint. Hearing the captain in 
person was as strange to them 
as it was to Verd. They sat look- 
ing at each other, and a few got 
up, changed their minds and sat 
down again. One called, “What 
will you do next?” 

“Ask the Brain for sugges- 
tions,” said Verd. “Out, now!” 
“We’d like to stay and listen,” 
said the same man. He was short 
and broad and big-footed, prob- 
ably from one of the heaviest 
planets, and he had the rough- 
edged compactness of a land 
tank. “We’ve the right to con- 
sult the Brain at any time. If it 
takes a translator we should have 
a translator.” 

Verd nodded. “That’s true.” 
Without further comment he 
turned to Chanda and said, “Ask 
the Brain what actions will maxi- 
mize our chance of survival for 
maximal time.” 

Chanda tapped her stylus 
rhythmically next to the Brain 
speaker. 

The dining room seemed rau- 
cous with the sound of breathing 
and the stealthy shuffling of 
feet. Everyone seemed to be 
leaning forward. 

The Brain answered in swiftly 
moving dots of light. Chanda 
said. “Immediately replace — 



Eve of Kdapt!” Chanda looked 
very startled, then grinned 
around at Verd. “Sorry, Cap- 
tain. ‘Immediately replace Verd 
Spacercaptain with Strac Astro- 
physics in supreme authority 
over ship.’ ” 

In the confusion that followed, 
Verd’s voice was easily the loud- 
est. “Everybody out! Everybody 
but Strac Astrophysics.” 
Miraculously, they obeyed. 

Ill 

S trac was a long, tall oldster, 
old in habits and manners 
and mode of dress; a streak of 
black-enameled steel wool em- 
phasized his chocolate scalp, and 
his ears spread like wings. Verd 
wondered why he didn’t have 
them fixed, and then wondered 
no longer. Strac obviously made 
a fetish of keeping what he was 
born with. His hairline didn’t 
start until the top of his fore- 
head. His fingernails had not 
been removed. They must have 
required constant trimming. It 
was a wonder he didn’t have a 
mustache! 

“I believe you’ve traveled on 
my ship before,” Verd told him. 
“Have you ever said or done 
anything to give the Brain, or 
any passenger, the idea that you 
want to command my ship?” 
“Certainly not!” Strac seem- 
ed as ruffled by the Brain’s sug-

gestion as Verd himself. “The 
Brain must be insane,” he mut- 
tered venomously. Then he look- 
ed up uneasily. “Could the Brain 

be insane?” 

“No,” Chanda answered. “Me- 
chanical Brains can be damaged, 
they can be destroyed, but if 
they come up with an answer it’s 
the right one. If there’s even the 
slightest doubt you’ll get an ‘in- 
sufficient data’.” 

“Then why would it try to 
take my command?” 

“I don’t know. Captain, there’s 
something you should know right 
now.” 

“What?” 

“The Brain has stopped an- 
swering questions It stopped 
right after the passengers left. 
It obeys orders if they’re given 
in Morse, but it won’t answer 
back.” 

“Oh, Kdapt take the Brain!” 
Verd rubbed his temples with 
his fingertips. “Parliss. what did 
the Brain know about Strac?” 

“Same as any other passenger. 
Name, profession, medical state 
and history, mass, world of orig- 
in. That’s all.” 

“Hmph. Strac, where were you 
born?” 

“The Canyon.” 

“Oh? Kind of lonely, wasn’t 
it?” 

"In a way, yes. Three hundred 
thousand is a tiny population 
for a solar system, and there’s 

178 



no room for more. There’s no 
air above the Canyon rim, of 
course. I got out as soon as I 
could. Haven’t been back in al- 
most a century.” 

“I see.” 

“No, Captain, I don’t think 
you can. In the Canyon, it’s the 
culture that’s lonely. The people 
are constantly surrounded by 
others, and everybody thinks 
just like everybody else. You’d 
say there’s no cultural cross- 
fertilization. The pressure to 
conform is brutal.” 

“Interesting. Strac, do you 
have any bright ideas that the 
Brain might have latched onto 
somehow? Or do you perhaps 
have a reputation so large in 
scientific circles that the Brain 
might know of it?” 

“No I’m sure that’s not the 
case.” 

“Well, do you have any ideas 
at all? We need them badly.” 
“I’m afraid not. Captain, just 
what is our position? It seems 
that the biggest emergency is 
that everyone is dead but us. 
How do we cope with an emer- 
gency like that?” 

“We don’t,” said Verd. “Not 
without time travel, and that’s 
impossible. Isn’t it?” 

“Of course.” 

“Chanda, exactly what did 
you ask the Brain? How did 
you phrase it?” 

“Maximize the probability of 

GALAXY 



our surviving for maximum time. 
That’s what you asked for. Ex- 
cuse me, Captain, but the Brain 
almost certainly assumed that 
‘maximum time’ meant ‘for- 
ever’.” 

“All right. Parliss, how long 
will the ship keep us going.” 

T)arliss was only thirty years 
old, and was burdened with 
youth’s habitual unsureness; but 
he knew his profession well 
enough. “A long time, Captain. 
Decades, maybe centuries. 
There’s some boosterspice seeds 
in our consignment for the Zoo 
Of Earth ; if we could grow boos- 
terspice aboard ship we could 
keep ourselves young. The air 
plant will work as long as there’s 
sunlight or starlight. But the 
food converter — well, it can’t 
make elements. Eventually 
they’ll get lost somewhere in the 
circuit, and we’ll start getting 
deficiency diseases, and — hmmm. 
I could probably keep us all 
alive for a century and a half. 
And if we institute cannibalism 
we could — ” 

“Never mind. Let’s call that 
our limit if we stay in space. 
We’ve got other choices. Strac, 
none of them pleasant. 

“We can get to any planet in 
the solar system, using the pho- 
ton drive. There’s enough solid 
core in the landing rockets to 
land us on any world smaller 



than Uranus, or to land and take 
off from a world the size of 
Venus or smaller, and we can 
take off from anywhere with 
the photon drive, leaving noth- 
ing but boiling rock behind. But 
nothing in the system is habita- 
ble.” 

“If I may interrupt,” said 
Strac. “Why do we have a pho- 
ton drive?” 

“Excuse me?” 

“Why does the Hogan’s Goat 
need a photon drive? Why didn’t 
she just use the Jumper to get 
from one planet to another, and 
the solids to get up and down?” 
“Oh. It’s like this. The math 
of Jumper travel postulates a 
figure for the mass of a very 
large neighborhood, one which 
takes in most of the local group 
of galaxies. That figure is al- 
most twice the actual rest mass 
in the neighborhood. So we have 
to accelerate until the external 
universe is heavy enough for us 
to use the Jumper.” 

“I see.” 

“Even with total mass conver- 
sion we have to carry an awful 
lot of fuel, And without the ar- 
tificial gravity to protect us it 
would take years to reach the 
right velocity. The drive gives 
us a good one hundred gee in 
uncluttered space.” Verd grin- 
ned at Strac’s awed expression. 
“We don’t advertise that. Pas- 
sengers might start wondering 



ONE FACE 



179 



what would happen if the arti- 
ficial gravity went off. 

“Third choice. We can go on 
to other stars. It would take de- 
cades for each trip, but by re- 
fueling in each system we could 
get to a few nearby stars in the 
hundred and fifty years Parliss 
gives us. But every world we 
ever used must be dead by now, 
and the G type stars we can 
reach in the time we’ve got may 
have no useful worlds. It would 
be a gamble.” 

Qtrac shifted uneasily in his 
^ chair. “It would be worse 
than that. We don’t necessarily 
need G type suns, we can settle 
under any sun that won’t roast 
us with ultraviolet, but we do 
need a binary planet. They’re 
extremely rare, you know. I 
would hate to gamble that we 
could reach one by accident. 
Can’t you order the Brain to 
search out a habitable planet 
and go there?” 

“No,” said Lourdi, from across 
the room. “The telescope isn’t 
that good, not when it has to 
peer out of one gravity well in- 
to another. The light gets all 
bent up.” 

“And finally,” said Verd, “if 
we did land on an Earth-sized 
planet that looked habitable, and 
then found out it wasn’t, we 
couldn’t land anywhere else. 
Well what do you think?” 



Strac appeared to consider. “I 
think I’ll go have a drink. I think 
I’ll have several. I wish you’d 
kept our little predicament se- 
cret a few centuries longer.” He 
stood up with great dignity and 
turned to the door, then spoiled 
the exit by turning back. “By 
the way. Captain, have you ever 
been to a one-face world? Or 
have your travels been confined 
to the habitable worlds?” 

“I’ve been to the Moon, but 
that’s all. Why?” 

“I’m not sure,” said Strac, and 
left, looking thoughtful. Verd 
noticed that he turned right. The 
bar was aft of the dining room, 
to the left. 

Gloom thickened in the nearly 
empty dining room. Verd fum- 
bled in his belt pouch, brought 
out a white tube not much big- 
ger than a cigarette. Eyes fixed 
morosely on a wall, he hung the 
tube between his lips, sucked 
through it, inhaled through the 
side of his mouth. He exhaled 
cool, thick orange smoke. 

The muscles around his eyes 
lost a little of their tension. 

Chanda spoke up. “Captain, 
I’ve been wondering why the 
Brain didn’t answer me directly, 
why it didn’t just give us a set 
of detailed instructions.” 

“Me too. Have you got an an- 
swer?” 

“It must have computed just 
how much time it had before its 



180 



GALAXY 



motor aphasia became complete. 
So instead of trying to give a 
string of instructions it would 
never finish, it just named the 
person most likely to have the 
right answer.” 

“That sounds right, Chanda. 
But why Strac? Why not me, or 
one of you?” 

“Good question,” said Chanda 
wearily. She closed her eyes 
and began to recite, “Name, pro- 
fession, mass, world of origin, 
medical history. Strac Astrophy- 
sics, the Canyon . 

IV 

"|"n the next few days, each 
member of the crew was 
busy at his own specialty. 

Lourdi spent most of her time 
at the telescope. It was a power- 
ful instrument, and Chanda told 
the Brain to find planets of near- 
by suns and hold the telescope 
on them while Lourdi looked. 
But even the nearest were only 
circular dots. 

She did manage to find the 
Moon — in a Trojan orbit, trail- 
ing sixty degrees behind the 
Earth in its path around the 
Sun. 

Parliss spent his waking hours 
in the ship’s library, looking up 
tomes on the medical aspects of 
privation. Gradually he was put- 
ting together a detailed program 
that would keep the passengers 



healthy for a good long time, 
and alive for a long time after 
that, with safety factors allow- 
ing for breakdown of the more 
delicate parts of the life-support 
system. 

Later he intended to prepare 
a similar program using canni- 
balism to its best medical ad- 
vantage . but that could wait. 
The problem was more complex 
than it seemed, involving subtle 
physiological effects from moral 
shock. It wouldn’t give them 
more than another century any- 
way, since the air circulator 
wouldn’t last longer than that. 

Very slowly and painfully, 
with miniature extensible waldo 
machinery, Chanda searched out 
the tiny burns in the Brain’s cor- 
tex and scraped away the char- 
red semiconducting ash. “Prob- 
ably won’t do any good,” she ad- 
mitted grimly, “but the ash may 
be causing short circuits, and I 
certainly can’t do any harm by 
getting it out. I wish I had some 
fine wire.” 

Once he was convinced that 
the Jumper was stone cold dead, 
Verd left it alone. That gave him 
little to do but worry. 

He worried about the damage 
to the Brain, and wondered if 
Chanda was being overoptimis- 
tic. She was like a surgeon 
forced to operate on a friend; 
she refused even to consider that 
the Brain might get worse in- 



ONE FACE 



181 



stead of better. Verd worried, 
and he very carefully checked 
the wiring in the manual over- 
ride for the drives, moving along 
outside the hull in a vacuum 
suit. 

He worried about the passen- 
gers, too. They would be better 
off if they were given the illu- 
sion that they were helping. The 
log had a list of passengers, and 
Chanda got the Brain to put it 
on the screen, but the only use- 
ful professions Verd could find 
were: 

Strac Astrophysics 

Jimm Farmer 

Avran Zooman 

The other professions were all 
useless here. Taxer, Carmaker, 
Adman — he was lucky to find 
anything at all. “All the same,” 
he told Lourdi that night, “I’d 
have given anything to find a 
Jak FTLsystems.” 

“How ’bout a Harlan All- 
trades?” 

“On this tub? Specializing 
nonspecialists ride the luxury 
liners.” He twisted restlessly in 
the air between the sleeping 
plates. “Wanta buy an aircar? 
It was owned by a sniveling 
coward — ” 

J imm Farmer was the heavy - 
planet man, with long, 
smooth muscles and big broad 
feet. He had a Jinx accent, Verd 
guessed, which meant he could 



probably kick holes in hullmetal. 

“I’ve never worked without 
machinery,” he said. “Farming 
takes an awful lot of machinery. 
Diggers, plowers, seeders, trans- 
planters, aerators, you name it. 
Even if you gave me seeds and 
a world to grow them on I could 
do nothing by myself.” He 
scratched his bushy eyebrows. 
For some reason he’d let them 
grow outward from the end of 
his hairline. “But if all the pas- 
sengers and crew pitched in and 
followed directions, and if they 
didn’t mind a little back-break- 
ing labor, I think we could raise 
something . if we had a planet 
with good dirt and some seeds.” 

“At least we’ve got the seeds,” 

said Verd. “Thanks, Mr. Farm- 

_ _ » 
er. 

Verd had first seen Avran 
Zooman walking through the 
hall at the beginning of the trip. 
Zooman was a shocking sight. 
His thin strip of hair was bleach- 
ed-bone white and started half- 
way back on his scalp. His skin 
had faint lines in it, like the pre- 
liminary grooves made in tooled 
leather. Verd remembered dod- 
ging into an empty stateroom to 
regain his composure. Obviously 
this man was a member of one 
of those strange, nearly extinct 
religious orders which prohibit 
the taking of boosterspice. 

But he didn’t behave like a 
religious nut. Verd found him 



182 



GALAXY 




friendly, alert, helpful and very 
likable. His thick We Made It 
accent was heavy with esses. 

“In this one respect we are 
lucky,” Avran was saying. “Or 
you are lucky. I should have 
been lucky enough to miss my 
ship. I came to protect your car- 
go, which is a selection of fertile 
plant seeds and frozen animal 
eggs for the Zoo Of Earth Au- 
thority.” 

“Exactly what’s in the con- 
signment?” 

“Nearly everything you could 
think of, Captain. The Central 
Government wished to establish 
a zoo which would show all the 
life that Earth has lost as a re- 
sult of her intense population 



compression. I suspect they 
wished to encourage emigration. 
This is the first consignment, 
and it contains a male and fe- 
male of every variety of domes- 
tic life on We Made It. There 
were to be other shipments from 
other worlds, including some ex- 
tremely expensive mutations 
from Wonderland designed to 
imitate the long extinct ‘big cats’. 
We do not have those, nor the 
useless decorative plants such as 
orchids and cactus, but we do 
have everything we need for 
farming. All we need is a place 
to plant it.” 

“Not quite. Not unless you’re 
carrying an all-purpose incuba- 
tor for the animals.” 



ONE FACE

“Unfortunately I am not. Per- 
haps I could show how to make 
one out of other machinery.” Av- 
ran smiled humorously. “But 
there is a problem. I am fatally 
allergic to boosterspice extract. 
This means that I will be dead 
in less than a century, which un- 
fortunately limits the length of 
any journey of exploration that 
I can make.” 

TT'rantically Verd tried to sort 
his climbing emotions before 
they strangled him. There was 
admiration that Avran could live 
so casually with the knowledge 
of imminent death, wonder that 
he could have achieved such a 
state of emotional maturity in 
what could be no more than fifty 
years. There was shame, and 
horror; compounded horror at 
the knowledge that he was flush- 
ing, and Avran could see it. 

Avran looked concerned. “Per- 
haps I should come back later.” 
“No! I’m all right.” Verd had 
found his tobac stick without 
thinking. He pulled in a deep, 
cooling draft of orange smoke, 
and held it in his lungs for a 
long moment. 

“A few more questions,” he 
said briskly. “Does the Zoo con- 
signment have grass seed? Is 
there any bacteria or algae?” 
“Grass, yes. Forty-three dif- 
ferent varieties. But no bacter- 
ia, I’m afraid.” 



“That’s not good. It takes bac- 
teria to turn rock dust into fer- 
tile soil.” 

“Yes.” Avran considered. “We 
could start the process with sew- 
age from the ship, and use trans- 
plants of intestinal flora. Mix in 
the rock dust a little at a time. 
We have earthworms fortunate- 
ly. It might work.” 

“Good.” 

“Now I have a question, Cap- 
tain. What is that?” 

Verd followed his pointing fin- 
ger. “Never seen a tobac stick?” 

Avran shook his head. 

“There’s a funny tranquilizer 
in tobacco that helps you con- 
centrate, lets you block out dis- 
tractions. People used to have to 
inhale the tobacco smoke to get 
it. That caused lung cancer. Now 
we do it better. Is there any 
tobacco in the hold?” 

“I’m afraid not. Can you give 
up the habit?” 

“If I have to. But I won’t 
like it.” 

Verd sat for a moment after 
Avran had left, then got up and 
hunted down Parliss. “Avran 
claims to be allergic to booster- 
spice,” he told him. “I want to 
know if it’s true. Can you find 
out?” 

“Sure, Captain. It’ll be in the 
medical record.” 

“Good.” 

“Why would he lie, Captain?” 

“He may have a religious ban 



184 



GALAXY 



on boosterspice. If so, he’d be 
afraid I’ll shoot him full of it 
if I think I need him.” 

There was no point in inter- 
viewing Strac Astrophysics again. 
Parliss told him that Strac spent 
most of his time in his room, and 
that he had borrowed a pocket 
computer from Chanda. 

“He must have something in 
mind,” said Parliss. 

The next day he came to the 
cabin. “I’ve gone through the 
medical histories,” he said. 
“We’re all in good shape, ex- 
cept Avran Zooman and Laspia 
Waitress. Avran has just what he 
said he had. Laspia has a pair 
of cultured arms, no telling how 
she lost the old ones, and both 
ulnae have machinery in them. 
One’s a dooper, one’s a mul- 
tirange sonic. I wonder what that 
sweet girl is doing armed to the 
teeth like that.” 

“So do I. Did you manage to 
sabotage her?” 

“I put a power gain in her 
room. If she tries to shoot any- 
one she’ll find her batteries are 
dead.” 

The sixth day was the day of 
the mutiny. 

V 

■'t Terd and Parliss were in the 
* crew common room going 
over Parliss’ hundred-and-fifty- 
year schedule for shipboard liv- 



ing, when the door opened and 
Chanda walked in. The first hint 
came from Chanda’s taut, deter- 
mined expression. Then Verd 
saw that someone was following 
her in. 

He stood up to protest, then 
stood speechless as a line of pas- 
sengers trooped into the crew 
room, filling it nearly to burst- 
ing. 

“I’m sorry, Captain,” said 
Chanda, “but we’ve come to de- 
mand your resignation.” 

Verd, still standing, let his 
eyes run over them. 

The pretty auburn-haired 
woman in front, the one who 
held her arms in an inconspicu- 
ously strained attitude while the 
others took care not to crowd 
her elbows — she must be Las- 
pia Waitress. Jimm Farmer was 
also in the front rank. And Strac 
Astrophysics, looking acutely 
embarrassed, and many looked 
angry; Verd wasn’t sure who 
they were angry at. He gave 
himself a few seconds to think. 
Let ’em wait it out . 

“On what grounds?” he asked 
mildly. 

“On the grounds that it’s the 
best chance we have to stay 
alive,” said Chanda. 

“That’s not sufficient grounds. 
You know that. You need some 
criminal charge to bring against 
me — dereliction of duty, sloppi- 
ness with the photon drive, mur- 



ONE FACE 



185 



der, violation of religious tenets, 
drug addiction. Do you wish to 
make such a charge?” 

“Captain, you’re talking about 
impeachment — legal grounds for 
mutiny. We don’t have such 
grounds. We don’t want to im- 
peach you, regardless.” 

“Well, just what did you think 
this was, Chanda? An election?” 
“We’re inviting you to resign.” 
“Thank you, but I think not.” 
“We could impeach you, you 
know,” said Jimm Farmer. He 
was neither embarrassed nor an- 
gry; he was a man doing a job. 
“We could charge you with ad- 
diction to tobac sticks, try you 
and convict you.” 

“Tobac sticks?” 

“Sure, everyone knows they’re 
not addictive. The point is that 
there aren’t any higher courts to 
reverse our decision.” 

“I guess that’s true. Very well, 
go ahead.” 

Parliss broke in, in a harsh 
whisper. “Chanda, what are you 
doing?” His face, scalp and ears 
were flushed sunset red. 

“Quiet, Pari. I’m only doing 
what needs to be done.” 

“You’re out of your head with 
grief for that damn mechanical 
moron.” 

Chanda flashed him a smoking 
glare. Parliss returned it. She 
turned away, aloofly ignoring 
him. 

Strac spoke for the first time. 



“Don’t make us use force, Cap- 
tain.” 

“Why not? Do you idiots rea- 
lize what you’re asking?” Verd’s 
self control was going. He’d been 
a young man when the Hogan’s 
Goat was built. In nearly two 
centuries he’d flown her further 
than the total distance to An- 
dromeda and back; nursed her 
and worried about her and lived 
his life in her lighted, rushing 
womb. What he felt must have 
showed in his face, for the girl 
with the auburn hair raised her 
left arm and held it innocently 
bent, pointed right at him. Prob- 
ably the sonic; no doubt he 
would have been swathed in 
calming vibrations if her batter- 
ies had worked. But all he felt 
was nausea and a growing rage. 

“I do,” Strac said quietly. 
“We’re asking you to make it 
possible for us to give you back 
the Hogan’s Goat after we’re 
through with it.” 

Verd jumped at him. A cold 
corner of his mind was amazed 
at himself, but most of him only 
wanted to get his hands around 
Strac’s bony throat. 

He glimpsed Laspia Waitress 
staring in panic at her forearms, 
and then something clamped a 
steel hand around his ankle and 
jerked. Verd stopped suddenly in 
midair. It was Jimm Farmer. He 
had jumped across the room like 
a kangaroo. Verd looked back 



186 



GALAXY 



over his shoulder and carefully 
kicked him hard under the jaw. 
Jimm looked surprised and hurt. 
He squeezed! 

“All right,” said Verd. “All 
right. I’ll resign.” 

VI 

r T''he autodoc mended two 
cracked ankle bones, inject- 
ed mysterious substances into 
the badly bruised lower terminal 
of his Achilles tendon, and or- 
dered a week of bed rest. 

Strac’s plans were compatible. 
He had ordered the ship to 
Earth. Since the Goat was still 
moving at nearly the speed of 
light, and had gone well past 
the solar system, the trip would 
take about two weeks. 

Verd began to enjoy himself. 
It seemed the first time since 
the last Jump that he had stop- 
ped worrying for more than a 
few minutes at a time. He even 
persuaded Lourdi to cooperate 
with Strac. At first she would 
have nothing to do with the mu- 
tineers, but Verd convinced her 
that the passengers needed her 
professional help. 

After a week on his back he 
started to move around the ship, 
trying to get an idea of the state 
of the ship’s morale. He did little 
else. He was perversely deter- 
mined not to interfere with the 
new captain. 



Laspia Waitress stopped him 
in the hall. “Captain, I’ve got to 
take you into my confidence. I 
am an ARM, a member of the 
Central Government Police. 
There’s a badly wanted man 
aboard this ship.” And before 
Verd could start to humor her 
she produced authentic-looking 
credentials. 

“He’s involved in the Free 
Wonderland conspiracy,” she 
went on. “Yes, it still exists. We 
had reason to think he was 
aboard the Hogan’s Goat, but I 
wasn’t sure until he found some 
way to disarming me. I still 
don’t know just who he is.” 
Verd saw she was frightened. 
“I did that. I didn’t want any- 
one wandering around my ship 
with concealed weapons.” 

“You fool! How am I going 
to arrest him?” 

“Why would you arrest him? 
Who would you turn him over 
to if you did? What harm can 
he do now?” 

“What harm? He’s a revolu- 
tionary, a — a seditionist!” 
“Sure. He’s fanatically deter- 
mined to free Wonderland from 
the tyranny of the Central Gov- 
ernment of Earth. Only Wonder- 
land and the Central Govern- 
ment are eons dead, and we 
haven’t a single Earthman on 
board. Unless you’re one, and if 
you are nobody knows it.” 

He left her sputtering. 



187 



ONE FACE 



Surprisingly, Strac had talked 
to no one, except to ask 
questions of the crew members. 
If he had plans they were all 
his. Perhaps he wanted one last 
look at Earth, ancient grand- 
mother Earth, dead now of old 
age. Many passengers felt the 
same. 

Verd did not. He and Lourdi 
had last seen Earth twelve years 
ago — subjective time — when 
the Goat was getting her lift sup- 
port systems renovated. They 
had spent a wonderful two 
months in Rio de Janeiro, a 
teeming hive of multicolored 
human beings moving among 
buildings that reached like frus- 
trated spacecraft toward the sky. 
Once they had even seen two 
Pierson’s Puppeteers, natives 
from l’Elephant, shouldering 
their way unconcerned among 
the swarming humans, but shy- 
ing like three-legged fawns at 
the sight of a swooping aircar. 

Perhaps Puppeteers survived 
even now, somewhere in the 
smoky arms of this galaxy or 
another. Perhaps even human 
beings lived on, though they 
must be changed beyond recog- 
nition. But Verd did not want 
to look on the corpse face of 
Earth. He wanted his memories 
unspoiled. 

He was not asked. 

On the fifteenth ship’s-mom- 
ing the Earth was a wide, bril- 



liant crescent, brightest where 
the seas had dried across the 
sunward face and left a vast, 
smooth bed of salt. The sun 
shone with eery greenish-white 
radiance beyond the polarized 
windows. Verd and Lourdi were 
finishing breakfast when Strac 
appeared outside the one-way 
transparent door. Lourdi let him 
in. 

“I thought I’d better come 
personally,” said Strac. “We’ll 
be meeting in the crew common 
room in an hour. I’d appreciate 
it if you’d be there, Verd.” 

“I’d just as soon not,” said 
Verd. “Thanks anyway. Have a 
roast dove?” 

Strac politely declined and 
left. He did not repeat his in- 
vitation. 

“He wasn’t just being polite,” 
said Lourdi. “He needs you.” 
“Let ’im suffer.” 

Lourdi took him gently by the 
ears and turned him to face her 
— a trick she had developed to 
get his undivided attention. 
“Friend, this is the wrong time 
to exercise your right to be in- 
consistent. You talked me into 
working for the usurper on 
grounds that the passengers need 
my help. Well, I’m telling you 
they need yours.” 

“Dammit, Lourdi, if they need- 
ed me I’d still be captain!” 
“They need you as a crew- 
man!” 



188 



GALAXY 



Verd set his jaw and looked 
stubborn. Lourdi let go of his 
ears, patted them gently and 
stepped back. “That’s my say. 
Think it through , Lord and 
Master.” 

Qix people sat in a circle 
^ around the table. Verd was 
there, and Lourdi and Parliss 
and Chanda. Strac sat in the 
Captain’s chair, under the Brain 
screen. The sixth man was Jimm 
F armer. 

“I know what we have to do 
now,” said Strac His natural 
dignity seemed to have deepen- 
ed lately; his thin, dark face 
didn’t smile, and his shoulders 
sagged as if ship’s gee were too 
heavy for him. “But I want to 
consider alternatives first. To 
that end I want you all to hear 
the answers to questions I’ve 
been asking you individually. 
Lourdi, will you tell us about 
the Sun?” 

Lourdi stood up. She seemed 
to know exactly what was want- 
ed. 

“It’s very old,” she said. “Ter- 
ribly old and almost dead. The 
Sun followed the Main Sequence 
all the way. After our Jumper 
went funny it continued to get 
hotter and brighter and bigger 
and bluer as the region of fusing 
hydrogen burned its way up to 
the surface. It could have left 
the Main Sequence by going 



supernova or by suddenly ex- 
panding into a red giant, but if 
it had there wouldn’t be any 
inner planets. So the Sun ex- 
panded to a white giant, absorb- 
ed Mercury, burnt up the last 
of its hydrogen and collapsed. 

“It contracted to a white 
dwarf. There was unradiated 
heat working its way out, and 
heat of contraction, and there 
were still fusion reactions going 
on inside, because nuclear fusion 
gives heat all the way up to iron. 
So the Sun still gave off light, 
and still does, even though for 
all practical purposes there’s no 
fuel left. Now it’s a greenish 
dwarf, and still cooling. In mil- 
lions of years it’ll be a reddish 
dwarf, and in more millions, a 
black one.” 

“Only millions?” 

“Yes, Stare. Only millions.” 
“How much radiation is be- 
ing put out now?” 

Lourdi considered. “About the 
same as in our time, but it’s 
bluer light. The Sun is much 
hotter than when we knew it, 
but all its light has to come 
through a smaller surface area.” 
“Thanks, Loudi. Jimm Farm- 
er, could you grow foodstuffs un- 
der such a star?” 

Peculiar question, thought 
Verd. He sat up straighter, fight- 
ing a horrible suspicion. 

Jimm looked puzzled, but an- 
swered readily. “If the air was 



ONE FACE 



lt9 



right, and I had enough water, 
sure I could. Plants like ultra- 
violet. The animals might need 
protection from sunburn.” 

“Lourdi, what’s the state of 
the galaxy?” 

“Lousy,” she said promptly. 
“Too many dead stars, and most 
of what’s left are blue-white and 
white giants. Too hot. I’d bet 
that any planet that had the 
right temperature for life would 
be a gas giant like Jupiter. The 
young stars are all in the tips 
of the galactic arms, and they’ve 
been scattered by the spinning 
of the Galaxy. There are still 
younger stars in the globular 
clusters. Do you want to hear 
about them?” 

“We’d never reach them,” said 
Verd. His suspicion was a cer- 
tainty. He blew orange smoke 
and waited, silently daring Strac 
to put his intention into words. 

“Right,” said Strac. “Chanda, 
how is the Brain?” 

4 6T 7"ery, very sick. It might 
* stop working before the 
decade’s end. It’ll never last out 
the century, crippled as it is.” 
Chanda wasn’t looking so good 
herself. Her eyes were red, un- 
derlined with blue shadows. 
Verd thought she had lost 
weight. Her hair hadn’t had its 
usual care. She continued, as if 
to herself, “Twice I’ve given it 
ordinary commands and gotten 



the Insufficient Data sign. That’s 
very bad. It means the Brain 
is starting to distrust its own 
memory banks.” 

“Thanks, Chanda.” Strac was 
carrying it off pretty well, but 
beneath his commander’s dignity 
he looked determined and — 
frightened. If Verd was right he 
had reason. “Now you know ev- 
erything,” he said. “Any com- 
ments?” 

Parliss said, “If we’re going 
star hunting we ought to stop 
on Pluto and pick up an air 
reserve. We could stay alive 
maybe three hundreds years 
that way.” 

“Uh-huh. Anyone else?” 

Nobody. 

“Well, that’s that.” Strac drew 
a deep breath, let it out slowly. 
“Now you know everything. 
There’s too much risk in search- 
ing the nearby stars. We’ll have 
to go down. Chanda, please or- 
der the Brain to land us on the 
highest flat point in the noon- 
equator region.” 

Chanda didn’t move. Nobody 
moved. 

“I knew it,” Verd said, very 
quietly. His voice echoed in the 
greater quiet. The crew common 
room was like a museum exhibit. 
Everyone seemed afraid to move. 
Everyone but Jimm Farmer, 
who in careful silence was get- 
ting to his feet. 

“You’re out of your mind.” 



190 



GALAXY 



Verd paused and tried to make 
his voice persuasive. “Didn’t you 
understand, Strac? The Brain 
put you in charge because you 
had more useful knowledge than 
the rest of us. You were sup- 
posed to find a new home for 
the human race.” 

'"T^hey were all staring at Strac 
-*■ with varying degrees of hor- 
ror. All but Jimm, who stood 
patiently waiting for the others 
to make up their minds. 

“You were not supposed to 
give up and take us home to 
die!” Verd snapped. But Strac 
was ignoring him. Strac was 
glaring back at them all, with 
rage and contempt in his eyes. 

Parliss, normally Nordic-pale, 
was white as moonlight. “Strac, 
it’s dead! Leave it! We can find 
another world — ” 

“You mewling litter of blind 
idiots!” 

Even Jimm Farmer looked 
shocked. 

“Do you think I’d kill us all 
for a twinge of homesickness? 
Verd, you know better than 
that, even if nobody else does. 
They were on your back, twen- 
ty-seven people and all their 
potential children, all waiting for 
you to tell them how to die. 
Then suddenly there was a mu- 
tiny. You’re free! They’re all 
shifted to me!” 

His eyes left Verd’s and rang- 



ed over his shocked, silent crew 
“Idiots blindly following the or- 
ders of a damaged mechanical 
brain. Accepting everything 
you’re told. Lourdi!” he snap- 
ped. “What does ‘one face’ 
mean?” 

Lourdi jumped. “It means the 
planet doesn’t rotate with re- 
spect to its star.” 

“It doesn’t mean the planet 
has only one face?” 

“Wha-at?” 

“"'he Earth has a back to it.” 

“Sure!” 

“What’s it look like?” 

“I don’t know.” Lourdi 
thought a moment. “The Brain 
knows. You remember you ask- 
ed Chanda to make the Brain 
use the radar to find out. Then 
she couldn’t get it to show us 
the picture. We can’t use the 
telescope because there’s no 
light, not even infra-red. It must 
be terribly cold. Colder than 
Pluto.” 

“You don’t know,” said Strac. 
“Well, I do. We’re going down, 
Chanda?” 

“Tell us about it,” said Jimm 
Farmer. 

“No.” Verd spoke with all the 
authority he could muster. The 
responsibility Strac carried show- 
ed in his bent shoulders and 
bleak expression, in his deep, 
painful breathing, in his prev- 
ious attempts to pass the buck 
to someone else. Strac must

know exactly what he was doing. 
He must! If he didn’t he couldn’t 
have moved at all! 

“Tell us,” Jimm repeated. His 
tone was flat with menace. 

“No. Shut up, Jimm. Or we’ll 
let you make all the decisions 
from now on.” 

Jimm thought it over, sudden- 
ly laughed and sat down. Chan- 
da picked up her stylus and be- 
gan tapping on the speaker.

r I 'he Hogan’s Goat lay at an 
odd angle, nearly in the 
center of a wide, ancient asteroid 
crater, under a small, fiercely 
bright sun set in a black sky. 

There, marring the oversized 
girdle with its remaining spires, 
was the ragged, heat-stained 
hole where the meteor had 
struck. There, extending for two 
thirds of her length, was the 
gash a rack had made along her 
belly in the last seconds of the 
landing. And at the tail, aft of 
the girdles, that static explosion 
of curved metal strips was where 
the photon drive had been be- 
fore Strac had ordered it cut 
free. 

It had been a bad landing. 
Even at the start the Brain was 
a fraction of a second slow in 
adjusting the ship’s gravity, so 
that the floor had bucked queas- 
ily under them as they dropped. 



Then, when the ship was already 
falling toward the crater, Strac 
had suddenly told Chanda that 
the photon drive had to be ac- 
cessible after landing. Chanda 
had started tapping — and the 
ship had flipped at an angle. 

The Hogan’s Goat had never 
been built to land that way. 
Most of the passengers sported 
bruises. Avran Zooman had a 
broken arm. Without booster- 
spice the bone was slow to heal. 

A week of hard, grinding labor 
was nearly over. 

Only servomachinery now 
moved on the crater floor. Most 
of the activity centered around 
the huge silver tube which was 
aimed like a cannon at a point 
ten degrees above the horizon. 
The drive tube had been towed 
up against the crater wall, and 
a great mound of piled, heat- 
fused earth now buried its low- 
er end. Cables and fuel pipes 
joined it higher up. 

“Hi! Is that you, Captain?” 

Verd winced. “I’m on top of 
the crater wall,” he said, be- 
cause Strac couldn’t locate him 
from the sound of his voice. The 
indeterminate voice had to be 
Strac. Only Strac would shout 
into a suit radio. “And I’m not 
the captain.” 

Strac floated down beside 
him. “I thought I’d see the 
sights.” 

“Good. Have a seat.”

“I find it strange to have to 
call you Verd,” said the astro- 
physicist. “It used- to be just 
‘Captain’.” 

“Serves you right for staging 
a mutiny — Captain.” 

“Of course. I always knew my 
unquenchable thirst for power 
would get me in trouble.” 
“Don’t give me that.” 

r I 'hey watched as a tractor- 
mounted robot disconnected 
a fuel pipe from the drive, then 
rolled back. 

A moment later a wash of 
smoky flame burst from the 
pipe. It changed color and in- 
tensity a dozen times within a 
few seconds, then died as ab- 
ruptly as it had begun. The ro- 
bot waited for the white heat to 
leave the pipe, then rolled for- 
ward to reconnect it. 

Verd asked, “Why are you so 
calm all of a sudden?” 

“My job’s over,” said Strac 
with a shrug in his voice. “Now 
it’s in the lap of the gods.” 
“Aren’t you taking an awful 
chance?” 

“Oh? You’ve guessed what 
I’m trying to do?” 

“Sure. You’re using the pho- 
ton drive to start the Earth 
spinning again.” 

“Why?” Strac baited him. 
“You must be hoping there’s 
air and water frozen on the dark 
side. But it seems like a thin 



chance. Why were you afraid to 
explain before?” 

“You put it that way — and 
then ask why I didn’t put it to 
a vote? Verd, would you have 
done what I did?” 

“No. It’s too risky.” 

“Suppose I tell you that I 
know the air and water is there. 
It has to be there. I can even 
tell you what it looks like, a 
great shallow ice dome, stratified 
according to freezing point, with 
water ice on the bottom, then 
carbon dioxide, and all the way 
up to a few shifting pools erf 
helium II. Surely you don’t ex- 
pect a one-face world to have 
a gaseous atmosphere? It would 
all freeze out on the night side. 
It has to.” 

“It’s there? There’s air here? 
Your professional word?” 

“My word as an astrophysic- 
ist.” 

Verd stretched like a great cat. 
He couldn’t help himself. He 
could actually feel the muscles 
around his eyes and cheeks rip- 
pling as they relaxed, and a 
great grin crawled toward his 
ears. “You comedian!” he laugh- 
ed. “Why didn’t you say so?” 
“Suppose I kept talking.” 

Verd turned to look at him. 
“You’ll have thought of some 
of these things yourself. Can we 
breathe the air? It had billions 
of years to change chemically 
before it froze. Is there enough

of it? Or did too much boil off 
while the Sun was a blue-white 
giant? Maybe there’s too much, 
generated by volcanic action af- 
ter the Moon was too far away 
to skim it off. Lourdi said the 
sun is putting out about the 
right amount of heat, but just 
how close will it be to a livable 
temperature? Can Jimm Farmer 
make us topsoil? There’ll be live 
soil on the nightside, but can 
we get there if we have to? The 
Earth must be frozen all the way 
to the center by now, there can’t 
be any radioactivity left — but 
the drive could still cause seri- 
ous earthquakes. Kdapt knows 
I’ve sweated over that one! 
Well, Captain, would you have 
taken all those risks?” 

“She blows.” 

Traces of hyrogen, too thin to 
stop a meteor, glowed faintly in 
the destroying light of the drive. 
A beam like a spotlight reached 
out over the sharp horizon. 

Anything that light touched 
would flame and blow away on 
the wings of the photon wind. 
The drive nosed a little deeper 
into its tomb of lava. 

The ground trembled. Verd 
turned on his flying unit, and 
Strac rose after him. Together 
they hovered over the shaking 
ground. 

In space the drive would have 



been generating one hundred 
savage gravities. Here ... al- 
most none. Almost. 

Little quick ripples came run- 
ning from the horizon where the 
drive beam pointed. They ran 
in parallel lines of dancing dust 
across the crater floor, sent rocks 
tumbling from the crater wall, 
coming closer and closer togeth- 
er. 

“Maybe I wouldn’t have risk- 
ed it,” said Verd. “I don’t 
know.” 

“That’s the real reason the 
Brain put me in charge. Did you 
see the oxygen ice as we went by 
the nightside? Or was it too 
dark? To you this frozen air is 
purely imaginary, isn’t it?” 

“I’ll take your professional 
word.” 

“But I don’t have to. I take 
one less risk than you do,” Strac 
said. 

Dust danced over the shaking 
ground. But the ripples were less 
violent, and were coming less 
frequently now. 

“The Brain was damaged,” 
Verd said softly, musing aloud. 

“Yes,” said Strac, frowning 
down into the old crater. Sud- 
denly he touched his controls and 
started swimming down. “Come 
on, Verd. In a few days we’ll 
have air. We’ve got to get ready 
for wind and rain.”
