IT DOESN’T TAKE A GENIUS 



to figure out how much you hate miss- 
ing the best story of your favorite writer 
or the major part of a great novel. But 
we can’t compute a formula to stock 
every newsstand in the country with 
enough copies of our popular magazines 
to satisfy every reader. So we some- 
times miss you and you miss us — and 
that’s a double tragedy. 

BUT THERE’S AN ANSWER. 

It doesn’t take a genius to handle it, 
either. All it takes is a minute of your 
time, for which we want to repay you 
with a handsome saving over the news- 
stand price. Just fill in the coupon — 
or write the information on a piece of 
plain paper — and mail it to us. Then 
you’ll be sure instead of sorry.

I hope some day to meet the Por- 
guens, Mr. and Mrs., Victor. The last 
Hue And Cry carried a letter from 
Mrs. Porguen, a well-stated afid cer- 
tainly reasonable presentation of her 
views on the February issue of Galaxy 
— to which I replied. Now Mr. Por- 
guen has taken up the debate in an- 
other excellent letter. 

My reply in the last issue still stands 
— I might add that stories must evolve 
in form and content as does everything 
else — including magazines. 

Now, Mr. Porguen: 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

The question of meanings is still both- 
ering us. The July- August “ Hue and 
Cry” brings us Mr. Corwins com- 
ments on “ The Last Night of the Fes- 
tival”, heavily emphasizing the graphic 
layout values of the story. It also con- 
tains your clarification that the story 
described ” a race of humans, survivors 
of mutual abuse, who had evolved into 
creatures capable of existing only in 
festival atmosphere — . 

Now, the graphic layout was a fresh 
visual experience, though I don't rel- 
ish the possibility of having every SF 
story so adorned. Spices are best in 
minute amounts. But the story itself— 
To make certain / hadn't missed its 
true value by giving up reading it too 
soon, / made it a point this time of 
going past the 8th. page, all the way 



to the 28th. The darn thing turns out 
to be worse than I thought. 

Plachta starts with what appears to 
be some sort of mystic poetry, giving 
us a bellyful of images, some delicate 
and beautiful, some cruel and shock- 
ing and some plainly hysterical and 
stupid. They describe the movement 
of a couple towards a crowd, across 
a lawn, to the edge of a forest, under 
the Gate of Blood, to the Final Grotto, 
past the Wisdom Trees but not (Oh, 
no!) into the Tunnel of No Return, 
then to play a game called “ The Spi- 
der and the Fly”, kiss each other, pro- 
ceed to the Lazy Lagoon and finally 
enjoy walking hand in hand under the 
Surprise Shower. Honest to God. 

When the verborrhea is over, they 
start explaining to each other what it's 
all about, 23 pages too late and 5 be- 
fore the end. They talk about it for 2 
pages and then Plachta gives us . 
more of the same! A agghhh! 

Mr. Jakobsson, “ The Last Night 
of the Festival” is fantasy, very defin- 
itely fantasy and not awfully good fan- 
tasy at that. Obscure imagery has nev- 
er been the mark of a good writer. 

Plachta must be somewhat aware 
of this, as he finally feels the need to 
include a plain-language explanation, 
by means of a dialogue near the end 
of the story. 

You speak of underlying realities. 
But eight rhymed one-sentence con- 
demnations of Nazi Germany do not 
a story make, Mr. Jakobsson. A nd, in 
any case, the whole thing had abso- 
lutely no business in a science-fiction 
magazine. 

Please, no more Plachta, unless he 
becomes a writer of SF stories. 

Take ” Slow Sculpture,” for ex-

I 

IKKO FALKYNBERG es- 
timated his chances of get- 
ing out of the window two and a 
half meters to his left and knew 
that, as of now, they were small, 
one move, and the Peacemen of 
the Brothers of God would jump 
him and either beat him to death 
with their peace wands or toss him 
in the contemplation cell and drop 
the key into a glacier crevasse. 

The former was by far the more 
likely. The contemplation cell, 
which Mikko had once been 
shown, was an iron-barred stone 
prison, a single, big, unheated 
chamber with some piles of straw 
in it and a stream of water running 
through it. Sinning members of the 
Brotherhood found themselves “se- 
questered for contemplation” and 



given one meal a day until they 
were either forgiven by the Table 
of Elders or died of exposure and 
malnutrition — whichever occurred 
first. 

The Peacemen had a use for that 
cell and apparently no use whatev- 
er for Mikko Falkynberg. 

On the other hand, while the 
Holy Guardians of Peace, like the 
other members of the Brother- 
hood, were forbidden to take hu- 
man life, they were permitted to 
subdue recalcitrant sinners. They 
could carry no weapons, but their 
peace wands were of dense, hard 
wood, four centimeters in diam- 
eter and seventy-five centimeters 
long. If a sinner departed this life 
while being subdued, that was the 
Will of God and no fault of the 
Peaceman. 

Mikko Falkynberg had no de- 
eire either to contemplate himself 
to death or to be subdued to death 
by others. 

The trouble was that some of 
the men surrounding him looked 
as if they were trying to figure out 
some way to do both — preferably 
alternately and for a long time to 
come. 

Sitting in a chair with half a 
dozen of the Holy Guardians on 
each side of him, Mikko ignored 
them and faced the Table of Elders 
— all eight of them — with perfect 
aplomb. 

The Patriarch Ebenezer was 
speaking: “You came among us 
as a stranger, saying you sought 




6 



IF 




the Truth. And now — ” he ges- 
tured gently with a thin white hand. 
“And now — this.” 

Mikko put his hands palm-to- 
palm in front of his broad chest. 
“Venerable Patriarch, I have been 
among the Brotherhood and dwelt 
with them for many weeks. I have 
listened, I have learned and I have 
obeyed. I now know the Holy 
Laws, the Holy Liturgy, and the 
Holy History—” 

Most bloody well especially the 
Holy History! 

“ — and during all this time I 
have been under the watchful and 
benevolent eye of Your Most Ven- 
erable Paternity. Tell me, most 
Reverenced Patriarch, have I, dur- 
ing that time, done anything — ” 
He paused very slightly. “ — any- 
thing whatever , that Your Most 
Venerable Paternity knows, of 
your own knowledge , could be 
called a sin?” 

His emphases were gentle. 

Silence fell in the room as old 
Ebenezer looked suddenly thought- 
ful. The Patriarch was old only 
physiologically; his chronological 
age was scarcely more than Seven- 
ty Standard Years. But the skin of 
his face was dark and wrinkled, 
and his hair and beard were white 
— in spite of the fact that he was a 
great deal younger than Falkyn- 
berg. 

Falkynberg had carefully re- 
frained from disabusing the Patri- 
arch of the notion that he, Mikko, 
was no older than he looked — that 



is, looked according to the Broth- 
erhood’s rather parochial ideas of 
physiological aging. The Brother- 
hood was aware that prolongevity 
treatments were usual in other 
parts of the galaxy but, since such 
things were the work of Sathanas, 
thee were not acceptable emotion- 
ally and therefore did not really ex- 
ist. If a man looked thirty-five, he 
was thirty-five and Patriarch Ebe- 
nezer looked upon Mikko as a 
youngster half his own age. 

“No,” said the Venerable Patri- 
arch after a long minute. “I know 
of no sin upon you. But you have 
heard the charges of the Wife Sa- 
ra.” 

“I have,” Mikko said solemnly. 
“They are grave charges indeed, 
Venerable Patriarch. I know not 
how to answer them save to say 
that I am innocent.” 

T HERE was an inarticulate, 
murmuring grumble from the 
Peacemen on either side of him, 
but Mikko ignored it. 

“Do you, then, deny the accusa- 
tion, my son?” Ebenezer asked in 
his dry, raspy whisper. 

“Most emphatically. Venerable 
One.” Mikko let his gaze move 
around the circle of the others at 
the Table. Jakob, next in line for 
the Patriarchy, was somewhat 
gaunter of face than Ebenezer, and 
had round, staring eyes that made 
him look corpselike in the flicker- 
ing light from the central fireplace. 
Enoch and Enos, the twin brothers,

were hard of face and hard of eye, 
with salt-and-oepper beards and 
long hair. Jared was as bald as a 
spaceship hull, with weight and 
musculature to match. Zachariah 
had thin, wispy hair, a great hawk- 
ish nose and eyes like lasers. Eph- 
ron had curly white hair and a re- 
ceding chin that made him look 
weaker than he really was. 

And then there was Lamech. 

The trouble with Lamech was 
that every time Mikko looked at 
the man, he felt as if he were look- 
ing at a distorted image of himself. 

Lamech stood a hundred eighty- 
five centimeters tall, was heavy-set, 
perhaps a little too fat around the 
middle. Full beard, full mustache, 
full head of hair curling at the nape 
of the neck, eyebrows the same 
dark brown as the rest of the hair. 
Beneath the brows were dark, 
wide-spaced, beady, rather piggish 
eyes that showed sharp intelligence. 
Jaw broad and heavy. Lips thick 
and expressive. 

Genesis 4, 23-24, Mikko 

thought. Except that it ought to 
be: Genesis 39, 7-20. 

In spite of the fire in the fire- 
place the big, logwalled room was 
chillingly cold. Outside it was even 
colder and Mikko wasn’t really 
dressed for any long exposure to 
that cold. 

Lamech slitted his piggish little 
eyes and said calmly, “Are we to 
doubt, then, the testimony of my 
prime wife? Sara has said that this 
man — ” 



“We have heard the testimony, 
Brother Lamech,’’ the Patriarch 
said in a voice that was as dry and 
blistering as a Valdusian wind. La- 
mech withered into silence. 

Mikko had early recognized the 
reason for Sara’s behavior. Take 
at random any woman who loves 
her husband. Allow them to cohab- 
it for, say, ten years, so that the 
newness wears off and routine sets 
in. Then suddenly present her with 
an exotic stranger who greatly re- 
sembles her husband but is far 
handsomer. Present her with a man 
who is stronger, cleverer, wiser, 
more understanding, more widely 
traveled and far more sophisti- 
cated. Present her with a man who 
has all of her beloved husband’s 
good qualities — and more — and 
none of his bad ones. 

What would any such woman 
do? 

Mikko Falkynberg had long ago 
resigned himself to the fact that 
this situation would come up in his 
life with random regularity and he 
had always made it a point, be- 
cause of the generosity of his soul, 
to do his best to help such women 
— provided, of course, that they 
had the beauty, intelligence, and 
emotional stability that appeal to 
the connoisseur. 

Sara had beauty and intelligence, 
all right, but emotionally she was 
as any primitive suffering under 
the duress of a puritanical society. 
He had avoided her as he would 
have an equivalent mass of un-

shielded Cobalt Sixty. As a result, 
he was now playing Joseph to La- 
mech’s Potiphar and was under 
tecnical arrest by the Table of 
Elders. 

If only Lamech— or Sara — had 
waited another hour! 

Ebenezer murmured, “Will you 
take a solemn oath to that effect, 
my son?” 

“Without the least hesitation,” 
Mikko assured him. He raised his 
right hand solemnly. As he did so, 
he glanced at the braided cuff of 
his robe. A tiny telltale glinted. It 
might have been taken for a bit of 
mica or a tiny shard of broken 
glass gleaming in the firelight but 
Mikko saw it for what it was. 

Tress had come over the hori- 
zon. 



M IKKO kept his right hand 
raised and put his left palm 
piously on his breast, thereby ac- 
tivating certain mechanisms. He 
began to speak in the solemn tones 
of the dialect of Italio-Swahili spo- 
ken on Ndullah. 

“Tress, hear me.” 

His voice was so deep and vi- 
brant that the Elders merely 
blinked and stared. They dared not 
interrupt. 

“Yes, Mikko,” said a small 
voice in Mikko’s ear. 

“Highest priority. Put a Num- 
ber Eight HKB with a four-second

sounded, so nobody will get hurt. 
Then be waiting for me as soon as 
possible at the rendezvous. How 
long will that take you?” 

“Number Eight HKB will ar- 
rive in eight point seven three min- 
utes. I will be at rendezvous in 
fourteen point six two minutes,” 
Tress said. 

“Amen,” intoned Mikko. 

After a full two seconds of si- 
lence, Patriarch Ebenezer blinked 
and said: “Er — we cannot accept 
an oath not of our tongue.” 

“Oh, of course,” Mikko said 
smoothly. “In prayer it is natural 
to revert to one’s native tongue. 
How would you have it worded, 
Venerable Patriarch? I am not, as 
you know, fully conversant with 
your Liturgy as yet.” 

Fetching the great, hand-lettered 
book in question took five min- 
utes, and reading out the appropri- 
ate paragraphs took another three. 
Mikko was all prepared to go 
through the oath seemingly a sec- 
ond time when he happened to look 
through the window to his left. 

“My word,” he said mildly. 

“What could that be? A fire?” 

A red glow was coming from the 
village square. 

Everyone craned his neck to see. 
With precision timing Mikko 
turned his back and closed his eyes 
a fraction of a second before the 
light turned from red to blinding 
white. 

He had judged the distance to 



the other window to a centimeter. 
He walked toward it, eyes still 
closed, opened it and jumped out 
into the snowbank below, ignoring 
the shouts and screams from the 
men in the room behind him. Af- 
ter five seconds the blinding white 
light died, leaving only a faint hiss- 
ing in the melted snow of the vil- 
lage square. 

Mikko Falkynberg opened his 
eyes and started moving toward 
the woods at the edge of the vil- 
lage. 

He still had a long way to go 
but it would be several minutes be- 
fore the Table regained eyesight — 
and several more before effective 
pursuit could be organized. He 
sprinted off through the snow to- 
ward the rendezvous. 

Twenty minutes later, he was no 
longer sprinting, just keeping up a 
steady plod toward the clearing 
where Tress would be waiting. He 
could hear no sounds of pursuit to 
his rear, although his footprints 
could have been followed easily 
enough. 

Had the flare so frightened his 
interlocators that they dared not 
follow or was the confusion still 
so great that they didn’t yet realize 
what had happened? 

He never did find out. A few 
minutes later the shadowy egg- 
shape of a spaceship was looming 
in the darkling night. 

Mikko climbed aboard and said, 

“Let’s get the hell out of here 
right now.”

KTYEEL, Metrak. That’s the 

-Tigood boy.” 

The elegant, meticulously 
dressed, fashionable gentleman 
who spoke was Mr. Morgan Oxbo, 
lately come to Beedirn City and al- 
ready acceptable to the upper lev- 
els of Beedirn society. He was 
wealthy, affable, witty without be- 
ing offensive and of excellent 
countenance. His intimate know- 
ledge of recent events in the More 
Important Centers of Galactic 
Power fascinated the gentlemen. 
The ladies were particularly taken 
by his small, neat beard and mus- 
tache and his wealth of curly, dark 
auburn hair. 

The creature to whom he spoke 
was small and low-slung, looking 
as though there were both dachs- 
hund and armadillo in his ancestry 
— which there was not, since nei- 
ther Terrestrial animal had ever 
been anywhere within fifty light- 
years of Maxaglor. Little Metrak 
had a glossy black hide and a 
round, high-domed head embel- 
lished with small, neat, close-set 
ears. His eyes were black, large 
and rather wistful and his mouth 
seemed to wear a plaintive smile. 
The ladies thought him “simply 
adorable” and they admired Mr. 
Oxbo’s taste in exotic pets, but 
Metrak seemed shy and skittered 
away on six stumpy little legs 
when they tried to pet him. And 
Mr. Oxbo had warned them that 



he might scratch if he were teased. 

Metrak, hearing Mr. Oxbo’s 
voice, came away from his careful 
exploration of a Public Utility 
control dome at the curb and 
trotted back to his place at Mr. 
Oxbo’s side. 

The two of them continued their 
promenade down the avenue to- 
ward the spaceport entrance, Mr. 
Oxbo holding Metrak’s leash in 
one elegantly gloved hand. The 
faint, tangy aroma of poon flowers 
hung on the warm breeze. Twice 
Mr. Oxbo tipped his hat to pass- 
ing ladies while Metrak trotted 
along a few inches from the heel 
of a boot that was as polished and 
as black as his own glossy integu- 
ment. 

They strolled in through the 
doors of the great lobby of the 
huge spaceport, crossed it and sur- 
veyed the slidewalks. One, which 
T’d off in both directions, sported 
a large sign with this information: 

DEEPSPACEBAR “► 
DEPOTIST 
FREIGHT BONDING 
FREIGHT RECEPTION 
FREIGHT SHIPMENT 
LOCKAGE & DOWAGE 
PRIVATE BERTHS 
STRANDED ALIEN LEAGUE “►

Mr. Oxbo and his small friend 
went to the left. A few minutes 
later, Mr. Oxbo was standing be- 
fore a desk labeled FREIGHT 
RECEPTION: Inquiries , proffer-

ing his card to a young, properly 
deferential clerk. 

“I am looking,”* he said in a 
pleasant voice, “for a small crate 
— about a hundred fifty kilos — 
which was to have been shipped to 
me from Synax IV. My agents 
said they had not yet been notified 
of its arrival, so I thought I’d drop 
round and see.” 

“Of course, Mr. Oxbo,” the 
clerk said, taking his card and the 
two-debit note which clung casual- 
ly to the bottom. “I’ll be glad to 
check the newly landed freight for 
you. Will this crate be consigned 
to you?” 

“Either directly to me — easy, 
Metrak! — or to my agents, How- 
ard and Gibbs.” 

“Very well, sir. Please sit down. 
I’ll see to this myself. Only be a 
moment.” 

“Ha, hm,” Mr. Oxbo said, sit- 
ting down and tapping his chin 
with the ivory knob handle on his 
onyx cane. “I shall await your re- 
turn.” 

He picked a copy of Intragalac - 
tic Freight Handlers Digest of 
Current Rules & Regulations — 
Southern Sector from the desk 
and leafed through it. Metrak, see- 
ing his leashholder preoccupied, 
slipped out of his collar and scam- 
pered after the clerk, his six paws 
making slight waltztime clicks on 
the concrete floor. The clerk failed 
to notice as the small creature 
scuttled through the inner door 
behind him. 



A brace of signs on the wall of 
the inner corridor said: 

CONSIGNED FREIGHT 

LOADING AND UNLOADING 

The clerk took the branch to the 
left. Metrak went to the right and 
kept moving until he reached a 
door which announced: 

COMPUTERIZED FREIGHT HANDLERS 
DANGER 

AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY 

A ten-centimeter space under 
the door allowed for air circula- 
tion. Metrak flattened himself. 
His cross-section, normally almost 
round, became more and more el- 
liptical until he looked something 
like an oddly shaped doormat. His 
head was the most difficult part 
to get under but he managed it. 
The rest of him slid beneath the 
door without effort. He resumed 
his normal shape, stood up on his 
rearmost legs and surveyed the 
room. 

This was a working section of 
the spaceport. With little allow- 
ance for walkways, indirect light- 
ing or other human conveniences, 
the vast area was filled with large 
crates, small crates, long crates 
and skinny crates. They were be- 
ing loaded and unloaded by crate- 
handling robots, stacked by crate- 
stacking robots, moved to and 
from ships by field cargo robots, 
sorted by sorting robots and 



12 



IF 




picked up for local delivery by 
messenger robots. Over all the 
darting eyes of the central cargo 
computer kept careful watch as 
its minions followed their detailed 
instructions. These crate-handling 
robots were not too bright — just 
smart enough to obey the orders 
of their master, the central cargo 
computer. 

Metrak dropped to all sixes and 
click , tickety-ticked across the 
floor toward a particular field car- 
go robot. One of the mobile eyes 
examined him. Humans and sen- 
tient aliens were not permitted in 
the area without carrying a special 
badge. 

Not human, the computer de- 
cided; not listed sentient alien — 
the computer searched for a cate- 
gory. Aha! The computer sent a 
message to Maintenance Depart- 
ment Subsection Rat & Rodent 
Control , and dismissed the prob- 
lem. 

Metrak reached the carrier — 
which had just about finished load- 
ing a group of unusually shaped 
crates — and crawled under the low 
overhang between the treads. Roll- 
ing over on his back, he reached 
up with his six legs, hooked over 
a frame brace and pulled himself 
up until he was clamped tightly 
in place. 

The field cargo robot got the 
last crate loaded firmly aboard its 
carrier and, chuckling softly to it- 
self, headed out the vast double 
doors onto the field. 



HE only ship incoming from 
Synax IV in the past week 
downloaded yesterday,” the clerk 
informed Mr. Oxbo. “The entire 
cargo was a private consignment 
of, ah, er, pleasure androids. For 
transshipment, of course.” 

“Of course,” Mr. Oxbo agreed 
politely. 

“So, I’m afraid your shipment 
just hasn’t — ” 

“It was transshipped through 
Von Haagen,” Mr. Oxbo said, 
smiling innocently at the clerk. 
“Would that make a difference?” 
“A difference!” The clerk was 
amazed. “My dear sir, that means 
I’d— if you’d told me — ” 

Mr. Oxbo produced another 
two-debit note between fore and 
index fingers with the languid 
aplomb of a conjurer. 

“Delighted, of course, to find 
the shipment for you in any case,” 
the clerk continued, not noticing 
his right hand take the money. “I 
shall be but a few seconds.” 
“Take,” Mr. Oxbo insisted, 
“your time.” 

T HE ship that the field cargo 
robot pulled up to had the 
characteristic breakfast look of 
an Uxorian freighter. Built like 
three stubby sausages tied in a 
bundle and surmounted by a 
poached egg, these ships had a rep- 
utation for cheapness, large capac- 
ity, stupidity, undependability and 
difficulty of repair. They were also 
impossible to get spare parts for 




F I AAB U LSOAAAAE R

and Uxor-trained machanics — of 
which there were few — were the 
only ones who would dare delve 
into their randomly plumbed and 
wired brains and bowels. The cap- 
tains of Uxorian freighters were 
either courageous and daring or 
broke and desperate. 

Metrak dropped off the under- 
side of the carrier as it reached its 
destination and, flattening him- 
self as much as he could against 
the gray concrete, scurried over 
to the near sausage. After waiting 
long enough to make sure he 
hadn’t set off any alarms or alerted 
any interior sensors, he flattened 
himself out against the near fin, 
hooked his forepaws over its slop- 
ing edge and started to climb. 

When he reached the top of the 
fin, some forty feet up, he wrapped 
himself around an external atmo- 
sphere engine fuel pipe and 
shinnied up, a black lump against 
the stainless steel. 

A ship’s officer wearing the in- 
signia of supercargo came around 
to inspect the loading and Metrak 
froze in place. The officer puttered 
around for three or four minutes 
with Metrak thinking dark 
thoughts overhead. This would 
throw the timing off. The officer 
wandered off without having once 
looked up. Metrak allowed him- 
self a Maxaglorian grin and con- 
tinued up to the end of the pipe. 
He was still a good many feet 
short of the deepspace hydrogen 
scoops that were his target. 



M ORGAN OXBO, alone in 
the clerk’s office, practiced 
his supercilious sneer. Then be 
practiced lifting both eyebrows in 
surprise. The inner door swung 
open and he reverted automatical- 
ly to languid boredom, his most 
successful pose. While I sit here 
out-incompetencing a clerk , he 
thought, smiling vapidly as the one 
in question entered the office, 
Mikko is plying our trade on a 
primitive planet. Wild parties . 
Native girls. He and Tress are 
having a fine old time . 

“I have succeeded in exacting 
the spacial coordinates in relation 
to the specified consignment as 
per your inquiry,” the clerk an- 
nounced. 

Morgan stared at the clerk. 
Success seemed to have gone to 
his head. “How meretriciously 
consanguineous of you, old man,” 
he murmured. 

“We always try to meet or ex- 
ceed our performance specifica- 
tions, as set down in the Intra- 
galactic Manual,” the clerk as- 
sured him. He looked so pleased 
at having found the crate that 
Morgan wondered if it was the 
first time. There was a good 
chance, since the stuff was usually 
robot-handled right to final deliv- 
ery. The crate had been located 
faster than Morgan had allowed 
for — Metrak wasn’t yet back. 

“Fine,” he said, thinking fast. 
“I knew I could count on you. 
Will you please arrange to have 



14 



IF 




both crates shipped to my resi- 
dence immediately? I would be 
ever in your debt.” 

“Ah, yes,” the clerk said, fid- 
dling with his marking pen. “Both 
crates, you say?” 

“Of course. One isn’t very 
much good to me without the oth- 
er.” 

“Ah, yes. You will excuse me 
for a moment while I, ah, make 
the arrangements.” 

Morgan nodded pleasantly and 
the clerk went back through the 
inner door. 

I T WAS good that Metrak was 
so high up on the hull— the 
climbing method he had to use 
now left traces. Finding a seam in 
the plating that went straight up to 
the near scoop, he inserted his 
powerful fingers in the crack and 
pinched the metal to obtain a 
climbing grip. He left a track of 
peculiar circular indentations 
along the edge of the seam as he 
climbed. 

No other Maxaglorian would 
have dreamed of trying such a sui- 
cidally insane stunt — not on the 
surface of Maxaglor. Beings who 
have evolved on a planet with a 
surface gravity of five times ten to 
the fifth centimeters per second 
squared — five hundred Standard 
Gees — do not much care for 
heights. Even the incredibly tough 
and hard body of a Maxaglorian 
cannot survive a drop of more 
than two or three meters. And, 



unlike the majority of giant plan- 
ets, or the supergiant in the 61 
Cygni system, Maxaglor does not 
have an extensive atmosphere. 
That was ripped away hundreds of 
thousands of millennia ago by a 
nearby satellite the size of Nep- 
tune. At the surface, the atmo- 
spheric pressure is four times that 
of Earth’s, but eighty percent of 
that consists of argon, neon, and 
helium. The five percent of oxy- 
gen means that the partial pres- 
sure of that gas is the same as it 
is on Earth. Thus the Maxaglori- 
an atmosphere is shallow; climb- 
ing even a rather high hill will soon 
put one into the stratosphere. 

“Low” gravity — less than four 
or five gees — gives a Maxaglorian 
the feeling that he is falling. Which 
gives him the feeling that he is 
within a fraction of a second of 
death. On Maxaglor, if you fall 
long enough to realize it, you are 
dead. 

It had taken Metrak a long 
time, using stem mental discipline, 
to be able to climb vertically; now 
he did so with practiced ease. 

The scoop was furled closed un- 
der an atmosphere shield and 
Metrak had to clench the seam 
with his two rear pairs of feet and 
pull open one edge of the scoop 
for a few centimeters with his 
short fingers. He reached in for 
the nearest control vane and 
wrenched it loose with one quick 
motion. Passing the vane down to 
a middle hand, he used his two 



FIAABULSOAAMER 



15 




forehands to unstrap a thin metal 
sheet which had been clamped to 
his underside. About four centi- 
meters thick, and shaped like a 
sixteen-centimeter shark’s fin, it 
was a close approximation of the 
removed vane. Metrak snapped it 
into place over the exposed gas 
teat and, with the pressure of two 
stubby fingers, secured it in posi- 
tion. He then strapped the excess 
vane underneath him, where the 
counterfeit had been, and eased 
the scoop shut. He inspected the 
scoop carefully for exterior signs 
of tampering and found none. 

Looking down, Metrak saw that 
the loading was finished and the 
carrier was preparing to depart. 
He snapped loose from the seam 
and, rolling into as tight a ball as 
he could manage with the vane 
strapped to him, dropped twenty- 
five meters to the concrete. 

HERE is only one crate 
consigned to you on the bill 
of lading, Mr. Oxbo,” the clerk 
announced firmly as he came 
through the door. 

“Really? How extraordinary,” 
Morgan said. “Perhaps — oh, there 
you are, Metrak,” he added as he 
caught sight of the short figure 
scurrying in behind the clerk. “You 
really mustn’t get off your leash 
like that, you might get hurt.” He 
clipped the leash back around 
Metrak’s shiny neck. “Well, no 
matter. Just send along the one 
you’ve located and I’ll make do.” 



He stood up and, tucking his 
cane firmly under his arm, saun- 
tered out of the office, Metrak 
clicking along behind.

M R. MORGAN OXBO sat 
in the study of his flat in 
Beedirn City reading, for the third 
time, the dynafax sheet from 
Lloyds that had been forwarded 
from the planet Proxit. 

Lloyds of London is one of the 
biggest insurance companies in 
this sector of the galaxy. They 
have, historically speaking, no 
connection whatever with the an- 
cient firm of that name that had 
existed so many centuries before 
on Earth. No person named Lloyd 
has ever been connected with it. 
It was founded by three gentlemen 
named Pembroke, Raskalnikov 
and Itahu but — prompted by the 
fact that they had set up their cor- 
poration on the planet London — 
they had named it after the an- 
cient, long-defunct firm and had 
fully and conscientiously lived up 
to the honor of that almost legen- 
dary name. 

As a parallel, there is a planet 
named Cajnelot a few thousand 
light-years from Old Mother 
Earth. It only has one small con- 
tinent, and early achieved a plane- 
tary government. Its chief execu- 
tive is called King Arthur and his 
advisory council is called The 
Round Table. Its historical con-

nections with the original King 
Arthur are as direct as those of 
the present Lloyds of London with 
the old firm. 

The dynafax read:

Sirs: 

Ref: Your contract 575088 
Preliminary contract ac- 
cepted. Registered. Debits 
Five hundred thousand, 
(5 10 5 Standard Debit 
Units) plus expenses. We re- 
affirm as follows: Quindar 
Engineering has contracted 
with certain other Compan- 
ies (see Ref. 12562641) to 
provide a planetary platform 
for scientific purposes, said 
platform guaranteed by 
Quindar to pass within five 
hundred (5 • 10 2 ) light-sec- 
onds of an A-5 star for a 
length of time guaranteed to 
be sufficient for full observa- 
tion of phenomena without 
danger to the observers. (For 
details, see OBQ-1272, earli- 
er ref.) 

We have been asked by the 
group of secondary compan- 
ies to provide performance 
and liability insurance for 



the observers at comprehen- 
sive group rates. 

The directors of Quindar 
Engineering refuse to supply 
information necessary for 
evaluation of risk or perfor- 
mance capability. 

Investigation shows that 
Quindar has not spent, in 
the known galaxy, anywhere 
near the amount our esti- 
mates assume for the cost of 
such a project. 

We have been unable to 
ascertain, by any normal 
means, the location of the 
star involved. 

You are authorized to use 
any prudent means to acquire 
this information. All lawful 
action will be supported by 
this office.

Morgan put the dynafax down 
and gnawed thoughtfully at the 
tip of his right thumb. 

The door announcer spoke: 
“There is room enough—” 

Metrak, who was curled up on 
an easy chair, fast asleep, didn’t 
hear the coded words. Morgan 
shot to his feet immediately. He 
strode over to the chair and tipped 
it, so that all one hundred twenty 
kilos of Metrak’s small, compact 
mass hit the floor with a resound- 
ing thud. Morgan kicked him sol- 
idly with a heavily booted foot. 

“Up, Professor; he’s here.”

“Gmf?” said Metrak. “Who? 
Oh. Yes. Thank you, Morgan.” 
Morgan was already out of the 
room by then, walking rapidly 
down the hall toward what the up- 
per classes of Beedirn called the 
receiving room. He flung open the 
door and went in. 

The man standing in the center 
of the room was wearing a coral 
satin silon coat, a gold double- 
phase waistcoat, white form-fit- 
ting trousers and brilliant black 
polysilon boots that came almost 
up to his kneecaps. 

He bowed to Morgan and said: 
“Mr. Oxbo, I believe?” 

“Quite so, Mr. Falkynberg,” 
said Morgan, returning the bow. 
Then, straightening: “No need to 
worry. The place isn’t bugged.” 
Mikko Falkynberg put his gray 
hat on a nearby chair and began to 
remove his gray gloves. “1 had as- 
sumed it wasn’t. Ah! Good morn- 
ing, Professor Metrak.” 

“Gnp,” said the Maxaglorian. 
“Good morning, Mikko. Good to 
see you. Wait till I wake up.” 
Morgan had stepped over to the 
sideboard and was pouring a good 
quarter of a liter of Aldebaranian 
brandy into a dynocrystal goblet. 
He handed it to Metrak, who 
drained half of it gustily, then 
blinked up at Mikko. “Ahhh,” 
he said. His highly efficient metab- 
olism had already begun to con- 
vert the alcohol to needed energy. 
“You are early, Mikko,” he con- 
tinued. “Explain, please.” 



“In a moment, Professor,” 
Mikko said. He raised an eyebrow 
at Morgan, but the expression was 
unnecessary — his partner was al- 
ready handing him a brandy-and- 
water. With it he passed on the 
dynafax. 

“Thank you, Morgan,” Mikko 
said, lowering himself carefully 
into a chair. “God! What idiots!” 

“The Brotherhood?” Morgan 
asked. 

Mikko narrowed his eyes, glar- 
ing. “Naturally. I was accused — ” 
He paused. “But never mind. 
Tress has recorded it all and you 
can get it later. I’ll give you a re- 
sume.” 

“I’m listening,” Morgan said 
quietly. 

“And am I,” said Metrak, run- 
ning his black tongue around his 
horny lips. 



l\>|IKKO rested his head against 
* * *the back of his chair. “Let me 
“Let me read this first.” He read 
it through, said, “Good,” then 
placed it carefully on the table and 
looked off into some strange noth- 
ingness beyond the ceiling. “The 
Brotherhood is trying to punish 
itself. That’s natural; it always has 
been. Their religion tells the 
Brothers that God wants them to 
live in a cold climate. They must 
suffer in order to achieve salva- 
tion.” 

“Why not suffer in a hot cli- 
mate?” Metrak asked. “Is not one 



18 



IF 




sort of suffering as good as anoth- 
er?” 

“No,” Mikko said, his eyes still 
somewhere beyond the ceiling. 
“Hell is hot and they can’t suffer 
in Hell because — ” He stopped 
abruptly and looked at Metrak. 
“Professor, shut up. You can get 
the data from Tress later.” 

Metrak bobbed his head. “Yes. 
Please continue.” 

Mikko took a sip of his drink. 
“They — the Brotherhood — don’t 

believe in history; only in the Eter- 
nal Now.” He flicked a glance at 
Morgan. “In other words, they 
don’t believe in reading and writ- 
ing, except for their Book of Lit- 
urgy. They believe only in oral 
generation-to-generation transmis- 
sion of history.” 

He put his glass down gently on 
the table, next to the dynafax. 
“We tracked them through Tak- 
karid, right? That’s the earliest 
trace. Eighty-three years ago. 
Right?” 

“Right,” Morgan murmured 
softly. Metrak said nothing. 

“Very well, I am being redun^ 
dant,” Mikko said. He picked up 
the dynocrystal brandy glass, 
drained it and stared at it for a 
moment before handing it uncon- 
sciously to Morgan. “I reiterate 
without apology,” he continued. 
“The tale we heard on Takkarid 
is accurate.” He got up and 
walked over to the window, look- 
ing out at the city without seeing 
it. 



Then he started pacing back and 
forth in front of the window. 

“Back up in time. Centuries. I 
can’t nail it down but if we say 
six or eight hundred years'ago, 
we’ll be in the right order of mag- 
nitude. At about that time the 
Brotherhood of God left Earth.” 
Morgan, who was running a 
forefinger around the edge of the 
brandy snifter, violining a perfect 
B flat from it, stopped suddenly 
and said: “Earth? Earth?” 

Mikko didn’t stop his pacing. 
“Earth. Or Alpha Centauri 
George. Same volume — and it 
doesn’t matter. But I’m satisfied 
that it was Earth. The Brother- 
hood got themselves a ship and 
took off. They found themselves 
the planet they were looking for: 
cold, but not too cold; just enough 
to make them miserable without 
actually killing them off. They — ” 
Metrak’s reverberating voice 
suddenly said: “Please, Mikko — 
a question.” 

Mikko turned away from the 
window and looked at the little 
being. “Yes, Professor?” 

“Why say you it was between 
six and eight centuries ago?” 

Mikko used his right forefinger 
and thumb to massage his nose. 
He hated being interrupted but he 
realized that in this case it was 
necessary. 

“Before eight hundred years 
ago,” he pointed out, “it would 
not have been possible for a small 
group to get hold of a spaceship.

The cost was too high, and the 
ships were too few.” 

Metrak nodded. “True. But 
since then?” 

“They are unmutated Old 
Stock,” Mikko said flatly. 

“Certain?” Metrak asked. 

“Certain,” said Mikko. 

“Very well. My apologies; con- 
tinue.” 

Mikko resumed his pacing. 
“They found the planet they were 
looking for,” he said. “They took 
off, cruised for God knows how 
long and accidentally found it.” 

“Then we don’t — ” Morgan be- 
gan. 

“Just wait,” Mikko said calmly. 
“They found it. They settled down. 
They figured they were safe from 
the rest of humanity from then on. 
They could build up their own so- 
ciety without any trouble. They 
could rear their children to believe 
their own particular brand of re- 
ligious absurdity without having 
to worry about any outside inter- 
ference. Happy, happy idiots. Mor- 
gan what the tell are you doing?” 

Morgan was wrapping a length 
of silver wire around the bell of 
the dynocrystal brandy glass. He 
looked up and blinked at Mikko. 
“What? Oh, nothing! Just fiddling. 
Get on with it.” 

Mikko flicked a fingernail 
against the diamonglas of the win- 
dow. “Very well. The Brotherhood 
found a planet — somewhere back 
then. They liked it. They had a 
planet that was chilly but not dead- 



ly cold. Perfect. Just what they 
wanted and needed.” He turned 
around to look at his audience 
again. Morgan was doing some- 
thing with the glass and the wires 
that Mikko didn’t like to look at. 
He closed his eyes and very care- 
fully refrained from saying: Mor- 
gan! Must you? 

“Then,” Mikko continued, “the 
planet got too hot for them.” 

Morgan’s delicate fingers sud- 
denly stopped moving. “Literal- 
ly?” 

“I think so. Quite literally,” 
Mikko said without stopping his 
steady pacing. “Something hap- 
pened that changed the climate of 
the part of the planet where the 
Brotherhood lived. Changed it rad- 
ically. The glaciers began to melt. 
Summers became longer and hot- 
ter. Winters became shorter and 
warmer. There were floods more 
and more often.” He turned and 
put out a hand, palm up, to Mor- 
gan. 

“What would you say: local or 
planet wide?” 

“This happened over a period 
of years?” Morgan asked. 

Mikko nodded. 

“Then I’d say planetwide. Some 
local change could affect the area 
for a year or two but anything 
that drastic, over that long a peri- 
od of time, would have to be plan- 
etwide as far as I can tell. Yes, 
Mikko, I think you’ve found it.” 

“Thank you, colleague.” Again 
Mikko resumed his pacing. “But

this gives us two different planets, 
doesn’t it?” 

“Right,” Morgan agreed. 



will excuse me,” Me- 
jL trak said, softly scratching 
with one tungsten-hard claw. 
“How does this show there to be 
two planets? I apologize for my 
abysmal ignorance. I had under- 
stood we were looking for a cold 
planet that was warming up.” 
“That’s right, Professor,” Mor- 
gan said. “But if the Brotherhood 
was able to live on this planet be- 
fore it started warming, it wasn’t 
nearly cold enough. To be the kind 
of heat-sink required for the proj- 
ect Lloyds is interested in, the sur- 
face temperature of the planet 
would have to be low enough to 
freeze the atmosphere.” 

Mikko waggled a finger. 
“There’s the further point that if 
the planet is on the type of come- 
tary orbit we were hypothesizing, 
there wouldn’t be an atmosphere 
any more. Previous close passes 
to its A-5 sun would have burned 
off any surface gases.” 

“I take it back, Morgan said. 
“After due thought I am forced 
to conclude that you haven’t found 
it after all. Two separate planets 
in highly eccentric orbits around 
the same A-5 star is a bit much to 
believe in without practice.” 

“Ah, but you haven’t heard all 
yet.” 



“Excuse my question again, 
please; could you tell me exactly 
what is this heat-sink? How do you 
refrigerate a planet?” Metrak 
asked, rolling over again and sit- 
ting up on his rearmost legs. 

“Not the whole planet,” Mor- 
gan said. “Just the environment 
unit being constructed for the sci- 
entists and observers. As a matter 
of fact, you use the cold of the 
rest of the planet to protect the 
observation city.” 

Metrak looked up at Morgan, 
tilting his head back. The black 
pupils of his eyes were indistin- 
guishable from the black pigmen- 
tation of the rest of the surface of 
his eyeballs except at very close 
range, giving him a blank, sight- 
less appearance. 

“Please, how is that done?” 

“A heat sink,” Morgan said 
patiently, “is a place where you 
dump excess heat. The surface of 
the observation planet is going to 
get hot rather quickly, so the ob- 
servation city itself will have to be 
refrigerated; the heat will have to 
be pulled out of it. But it will take 
quite a while for even an A-5 sun 
to heat up a planetary mass with a 
temperature of three or four de- 
grees all the way to the core. So 
you drill down several miles and 
run nickel steel, or high-ytterbium 
copper tubes down into the planet 
and use the core itself as the cold 
end of your refrigerating system. 
There are other ways — but that 
would be the cheapest and proba-

bly the most efficient. Do you fol- 
low me?” 

“I do indeed,” said the Profes- 
sor. “I thank you, Morgan. Par- 
don me, Mikko; I interrupted you. 
You were saying that we had not 
yet heard all.” 

“So I was,” Mikko agreed. 
“There is one more datum. Some 
eighty-three years ago, the Broth- 
erhood left the planet we are dis- 
cussing and eventually established 
themselves on the planet where I 
sojourned with them for a few 
painful weeks. I discovered, dur- 
ing my study of their Holy His- 
tory, that while they gave the rise 
in temperature of their old planet 
as the moral reason for their leav- 
ing it, there was another, rather 
more immediate reason for leav- 
ing. There was a planet falling on 
them.” 

Morgan looked up sharply. 
“Ohhhh?” 

“One of the planets in their sys- 
tem was moving toward them, ap- 
parently,” Mikko said. “They 
took it as a sign of collision and 
catastrophe, so they decided to 
pack up and go.” 

“Quindar’s planet?” asked Mor- 
gan. 

“No,” Mikko said. “The planet 
would have to have been fairly 
bright in order for them to see it, 
since they have no telescopes; they 
don’t believe God wants them to 
use such things. After eighty-three 
years it must have passed the pri- 
mary and looped away again.” 



“It gets difficult,” Morgan said. 

“As my great-aunt Agatha has 
been known to remark, it’s always 
darkest before the dawn,” Mikko 
assured him. 

“That’s one of hers?” Morgan 
asked. 

“Right.” 

“No telescopes,’’ Morgan 
mused. “Fascinating. How did they 
manage to operate their getaway 
ship? How did they, come to think 
of it, manage to justify operating 
the ship?” 

“What ship?” Mikko asked. 
“The reason we stumbled across 
the reference to them in our, ah, 
perusal of the personal file hidden 
in the private safe behind two pair 
of locked doors in the study of 
one of the directors of Quindar 
Engineering,” he paused For a 
breath, “is that they didn’t have a 
ship. At least, not one that worked 
any more.” 

“Don’t sound judgmental,” 
Morgan said. “If they weren’t so 
secretive we wouldn’t have to re- 
sort to illicit measures.” 

“Morgan, old friend, let’s be 
honest. If they weren’t so secretive 
we wouldn’t have a job. If Lloyds 
could have gotten the information 
on the project without hiring us 
you know damn well they would 
have; we are very expensive. If 
there wasn’t so much money tied 
up in the prospective policies, 
Lloyds wouldn’t have bothered. 
Besides, it’s fun.” 

“True,” Morgan admitted.

clipping a small, black, waxy-look- 
ing tube onto the maze of silver 
wire in his hand. A tiny spark ran 
along the wire, orbiting the brandy 
glass in what appeared to be sever- 
al directions at once. 

Mikko didn’t look. “Our friend 
the director,” he explained to 
Metrak, “was a minor official on 
the planet the Brotherhood main- 
tained contact with through their 
one inverse-space portal. It, you 
see, has no moving parts. As my 
great-uncle the Duke used to say, 
if it doesn’t move, it must be very 
deep indeed. 

“When the planet began to fall 
on them, the elders called for aid, 
and our friend was one of those 
who helped supply it. Shortly after 
that, he left his post and joined the 
newly formed Quindar Engineer- 
ing Corporation. Suggestive?” 

“Indeed,” Metrak agreed. 
“Most suggestive.” 

“They went out to rescue the 
Brotherhood,” Morgan said, set- 
ing his silver-wire wrapped brandy 
glass down on the nearest table, 
where it quietly quivered. “They 
found something. Something the 
Brotherhood didn’t have the in- 
strumentation to discover them- 
selves. Shortly after, they start 
Quindar Engineering. It must be 
the same system, somehow.” 

“That’s what I — Morgan, what 
the hell is that thing?” 

“This?” Morgan innocently 
tapped the side of the brandy glass. 
The room was instantly filled with 



a low, mellow sound that seemed 
to be constantly going up in pitch, 
although it never arrived. “It’s a 
Little Snifter-Operated Cascade 
Sounder. I plan to manufacture 
them and retire on the proceeds.” 

“Arrghugh!” Mikko said calm- 

ly- 

Morgan shut the thing off, sad- 
ly regarding the slowly melting 
brandy glass. “It still has a few 
bugs. You will be pleased to know, 
Mikko, that we have done some- 
thing useful. At least, Metrak has 
done something useful while I pro- 
vided cover.” 

“I am pleased to know that,” 
Mikko agreed. “What is it that 
you have done?” 

“Metrak planted an inverse 
space portal on the cargo ship we 
were trying to trace. We couldn’t 
seem to get any information any 
other way, so we resorted to de- 
ception.” 

“Great!” Mikko said. “In the 
name of my great-grandfather, the 
rightful King of Faulkenberg, I 
salute you. But portals aren’t di- 
rectional.” 

“Right. It’s going to activate 
when they come out of drive and 
send us an analysis of local star- 
spectra.We should be able to fig- 
ure out where it is from that.” 

“Very clever,” Mikko approved. 
“How did you manage to hook it 
in to the ship’s power supply?” 

“Not necessary,” Metrak told 
him. “One-time power only. It 
blows up.”

“Blows up?” Mikko stared at 
Morgan. 

“I prefer to think of it as ‘ex- 
plosive energization,” Morgan ex- 
plained. 

“You go too far!” Mikko said 
sternly. “Really! Blowing up a 
perfectly innocent cargo ship just 
to—” 

“Mikko, come off it. You know 
1 wouldn’t do that. Not the whole 
ship — just part of it.” 

“Wonder of wonders,” Mikko 
said. “Come along, crew. Tress is 
waiting.” 

IV 

I NSIDE the Umpaul Raatgar- 
den , an aging freighter of Uzo- 
rian design and Friedlander regis- 
try, the crew took up their break- 
out stations. On most ships this 
would have been pointless ritual, 
since the problems attendant to 
turning off the flicker drive and 
returning full time to normal 
space had been solved over a cen- 
tury ago. On the Umpaul Raat - 
garten it was necessity. 

Heidigar van Bronk, master and 
one-tenth owner of the Umpaul 
Raatgarten , strapped himself into 
his chair. “Make for all ready,” 
he called into the intercom. A 
chorus of male voices sounded 
“All ready!” back at him. 

“Crew reports all secure,” the 
grating voice of the ship’s com- 
puter announced. 

“What from you, you triple- 



plated imbecile?” Van Bronk 
asked. 

“Ship and cargo all secure,” 
the computer replied. 

“Hah! Very well, Mr. Christians- 
sen, you may proceed already.” 

The pilot nodded and slowly, 
gingerly brought the control lever 
back from its full-on position. The 
Interspace-Phase Flicker Control 
dial, which was marked logarith- 
mically from 1 Khz to zero, re- 
volved evenly around its needle to 
the peg. 

At about 30hz an unsympathet- 
ic vibration started building up in 
the ship’s hull: the floors vibrated, 
the walls shook, the light panels 
flickered slightly and van Bronk 
felt nauseated. At 20hz a low hum- 
ming sound came from the ship’s 
speakers. At 15hz it came from the 
walls. Then the needle pegged, all 
vibration stopped and a rending 
crash sounded from below. 

“What in Kriskindom was 
that?” van Bronk yelled. 

“An object, mass two hundred 
kilos, broke loose on delta deck,” 
the computer informed him. 

“Why the hell wasn’t the cargo 
more securely lashed?” he de- 
manded, releasing the seatweb and 
striding over to the master control 
board. 

“Cargo securely lashed,” the 
computer stated. 

“Then what the hell was that?” 

The computer consulted its 
memory banks, with a keening 
sound, to establish the master’s

IF 




reference. “The that was the ship’s 
water purifier,” it said, sounding 
smug. 

Van Bronk snapped his feltscribe 
in half and threw the pieces at the 
far wall. “Send to delta deck a re- 
pair crew,” he yelled into the inter- 
com, “and report so soon as possi- 
ble.” 

“Why does the ship act that way 
when it comes out of flicker 
drive?” asked Mr. Christianssen, 
who had signed on the Umpaul 
Raatgarten after the last pilot had 
disappeared on Beedirn. 

“You tell me, please,” van 
Bronk said. “I have every mechan- 
ic in each post we stop go over the 
drive, and they say, all of them, 
that there is no reason why it 
should behave as it does. I should 
go to Uxor, they tell me. Then I 
tell them where to go. Also to 
Uxor should I go to have this com- 
puter overhauled. The thing is 
sealed, and seems to be filled with 
some kind of green goo. To Uxor 
I should go. Only with bombs do I 
go to Uxor. Secure, please, from 
flicker drive.” 

“Drive secure,” the pilot said, 
flicking the appropriate switch. 
“Pulse gate discharged. Hull dis- 
charged. Scoops in — ” There was 
a ripping sound and a sudden thud, 
as if a giant boot had just kicked 
the ship. 

“Gott verblast!” van Bronk ex- 
claimed. 

“Trouble blinker on number two 
scoop,” the pilot said. He con- 



sulted his board. “Apparently part 
of it has ripped away. Yes,” he 
added, flicking the viewer to scan 
that section of the hull, “that’s 
what happened. The outer corner 
has ripped loose. I can see one of 
the vanes drifting away from the 
ship.” 

A blinding white light filled the 
viewer. Van Bronk blinked and the 
light was gone, as was the drifting 
wreckage. “Double verblast!” he 
shouted into his pilot’s ear. “Now 
we have exploding vanes. I would 
not wish my worst enemy to go to 
Uxor. I will go to Uxor myself 
and speak gently to the designers 
of this ship. Send a recognition 
call,” he told the computer, “on 
the frequency used by this planet.” 

“What planet?” 

Van Bronk clenched his fists. “I 
hate you,” he told the computer. 
“The planet we have arrived at, 
you rasping moron.” 

“Very good,” the computer 
said. It hummed. 

The main comm-screen lit up, 
displaying what looked like a hand- 
drawn test pattern. “What ship is 
that?” a non-commital voice 
asked. 

“Verblast!” van Bronk yelled, 
stepping in front of the viewer. “It 
is your own specified recognition 
call we are using. If you don’t be- 
lieve that, what good is my word? 
We are the Umpaul Raatgarten , 
for the fourth time. Just as we 
were last month and three months 
ago.

Four fingers appeared on the 
test pattern and lifted it out of the 
way, revealing a round-faced youth 
with jug ears. Don’t get your hip- 
pies in an uproar, Captain,” he 
said. “I’m only following my in- 
structions.” 

“Your verdammt instructions 
are about on a level with every- 
thing else which already has hap- 
pened today. First the water gismo 
breaks loose, then we have an ex- 
plosion, then you. I take you with 
me to Uxor, maybe.” 

“An explosion?’’ the youth 
asked. “Wait a second.” His face 
bobbed off the screen, which stayed 
blank for about three minutes, 
then an older, darker and thinner 
face replaced it. 

“Good afternoon, Captain van 
Bronk,” the new face said. 

“Here it is night, ship time,” 
van Bronk said. “Good night, 
Herr Richtman.” 

“Whatever,” the head said, an 
arm appearing and waving after- 
noon/night away as unimportant. 
“What’s this about an explosion?” 

Van Bronk shrugged. “One of 
the vanes ripped off when we came 
out of flicker drive. From the 
scoop, you understand. Then it ex- 
ploded. Poof.” 

“Oh. This was on the outside of 
the ship, then?” 

“You show me a ship what has 
the hydrogen scoops on the in- 
side,” van Bronk challenged. 

“Do you think it could have 
been sabotage?” 



“Who would want to blow up a 
vane after it breaks off the ship? 
Maybe some conservationists? 
Afraid it would fall and hit a 
duck?” 

“Do vanes usually break off 
scoops?” Richtman asked. 

“On this ship? If something 
doesn't go wrong, then I suspect 
sabotage.” 

“Well, could it have been some 
sort of signal?” 

“It could,” van Bronk granted. 
“It certainly could. Right now it’s 
propagating through space at the 
speed of light. Inside of three years 
it will reach the nearest star out- 
side this system. In slightly more 
than fourteen years it will get to 
the nearest inhabited planet. Why 
should I tell you not to worry? In 
only fourteen years, if they’re 
looking in exactly the right place 
at exactly the right tenth of a sec- 
ond — and have some kind of in- 
strument that t can separate that 
flash from the light of the sun right 
behind it — they’ll see a flash. 
Worry.” 

The dark face nodded. “Okay, 
expert,” he said. “Mr. Goodbit has 
standing instructions to check any- 
thing unusual, so I’m checking. 
Bring your jinx ship in and we’ll 
get it unloaded. The landing bea- 
con’s on now.” The screen went 
dark. 

Van Bronk told the pilot to ma- 
neuver the ship into a landing or- 
bit and sat back, quietly wonder- 
ing what would go wrong next.

T respassers w gleamed 

bright silver on her sunlit side 
where she rested in space, sharing 
Beedirn’s orbit around its sun. 
Obviously not built for commerce 
in either goods or passengers, she 
was, by deepspace standards, a 
small, trim ship. It was impossible 
to tell her function from external 
appearance: possibly a scout ship 
or courier for some interstellar 
navy; possibly a research vessel 
commissioned by a great univer- 
sity and carrying a complement of 
dedicated scientists; possibly a 
revenue cutter, guarding against 
smugglers and pirates; possibly 
that ultimate in rich men’s toys, a 
luxurious space yacht. 

In her fairly short existence she 
had been most of the above. Her 
hull was laid in a naval shipyard in 
expectation of a war which didn’t 
break out. She had served as a pi- 
rate-chaser before being sold to 
the Leadlar Foundation for certain 
esoteric researches into the posi- 
tronic flux around collapsed stars. 
After this five-year mission, the 
results of which are still being ar- 
gued by learned bodies of great 
specialization, she was purchased 
by a man of great dignity and in- 
herited wealth and refurbished 
from bowsprit to back plates with 
nothing less than the very best. 
The latest ship’s computer was 
brought all the way from Proxit to 
replace the Navy regulation mod- 



el. This worthy, on his very first 
short hop in his new toy, found 
himself having an argument with 
his own ship, as represented by 
her new, ultra-expensive compu- 
ter. He returned home enraged 
and ordered the ship sold as scrap; 
which was done. 

The hull, “with all appurte- 
nances and dunnage,” was sold 
“in as-is condition, all registered 
sales being regarded as final,” to 
Mssrs. Morgan Oxbo and Mikko 
Falkynberg, who were agreeably 
surprised upon inspecting their 
purchase. Aside from containing 
several crates of unopened delica- 
cies and fine wines, the ship had 
the best computer either of them 
had ever seen. The previous own- 
er’s problem seemed to have been 
composed in equal parts of his 
own stubbornness and some very 
slipshod programing done by his 
local experts. Since they planned 
to use their own carefully com- 
pounded program anyway, they 
merely expanded it to utilize the 
greater abilities of their new ma- 
chine and were quite content. 

After several interesting shake- 
down cruises they decided that the 
newly christened Trespassers W 
was ready for action. The four- 
being team: Morgan, Mikko, Me- 
trak the Maxaglorian and Tres- 
passers W, announced very dis- 
creetly, in certain select circles, 
that they were in business. And 
they had been busy ever since. 

“Gentlemen,” Trespassers W

announced in her sweetest voice, 
“I have received the burst we have 
been waiting for. Shall I print it 
for you?” 

Morgan put dovtfh the solder- 
ing pencil he had been using and 
swiveled around in his chair. “We 
trust you, Tress,” he said. “Just 
throw it on the screen and give us 
the analysis.” 

Mikko trotted into the lounge 
from the galley, mixing bowl still 
clutched in one pawlike hand and 
wooden spoon brandished baton- 
like in the other, and settled on 
the couch. Metrak looked up from 
his copy of The Gracious Hostess , 
one of the books Morgan had pur- 
chased for him in Beedirn City, 
and squatted comfortably on his 
middle and rear legs. 

A row of wall panels on the op- 
posite side of the lounge went 
black. Tress said: “The inverse- 
space portal lasted a full two mil- 
liseconds longer than you told me 
to expect, Morgan, so I have more 
data than 1 had planned on — ” and 
put a complex, chromatic wave 
pattern onto the black screen. “I 
have projected here the full spec- 
trum, from infrared to gamma ra- 
diation, as received. It is, of 
course, corrected to conform to 
your visual range. The actual vis- 
ible-light part of the spectrum 
would be this.” Here two black 
bands cut off a small section at 
the low red end of the pattern. 

“Very good,” Mikko said, 
thoughtfully staring at the screen 



while he mixed his batter. “What 
have we got, Tress?” 

A portion of the wave pattern 
disconnected itself from the rest 
and rose to form a separate chart 
above. “This would seem to be a 
representation of the energy blast 
which activated the inverse-space 
tube, probably reflected off the 
hull of the ship carrying it,” Tress 
said. 

“Yes, I didn’t think of that,” 
Morgan said. “I’ll try to make a 
gadget which blows with less radi- 
ant energy next time. Anything 
else?” 

“The ship seems to have a very 
dirty hull,” Tress commented, then 
blacked that part of the chart. 
“What’s left,” she continued, “is 
principally the radiation pattern 
of a G-3 type star, about one AU 
away.” 

“G-3?” Morgan quizzed. 

“That’s a problem,” Mikko 
said, sitting forward in his chair. 
“What we’re looking for is an A-5 
type and the planet would need to 
be quite a bit further away.” 

“Now there is something very 
interesting, gentlemen,” Tress said 
with unmechanical relish. 

“What’s that?” Mikko asked. 
“Don’t be coy, little one.” 

“I notice a slight discontinuity,” 
Tress said, quite evidently proud 
of her own cleverness. “Notice 
that if you null all the radiation 
pattern to be expected from a G-3 
star — ” here most of the bright 
display went black, leaving only

IF 




slight wisps of color scattered 
along the chart, mostly on the 
very-short wave end — “there is a 
ghost left. Upon DeFrybian analy- 
sis, this proves to be the reflection 
of an A-5 type star, bounced off 
the photosphere of the G-3.” 
Morgan frowned. 

Mikko said, “Of course — ” just 
as Morgan’s frown cleared. 
“Reflection?” asked Metrak. 
“Certainly,” Mikko said smug- 
ly. “That explains a great deal. 
The star is a binary; one hot com- 
ponent and one cooler one. There 
are two different planets, but 
they’re in the same system.” 

“How’s that?” Morgan asked. 
“One going around the A-5, and 
one around the G-3?” 

“No,” Mikko said. “That 
wouldn’t be likely. That would 
mean that the cold one, Quindar’s 
planet, would be in a highly eccen- 
tric orbit around the A-5, ap- 
proaching its primary at just the 
specific moment in time that the 
Brotherhood’s planet is warming 
up because the A-5 is approaching 
it! How does it compute to you, 
Tress?” 

“Vanishingly small probability,” 
Tress told them. “The most likely 
situation is that both planets re- 
volve about the G-3: the first at 
one AU, plus or minus ten per- 
cent, the second much farther out. 
Assuming the G-3 to be station- 
ary, the A-5’s orbit would be a 
highly eccentric ellipse with a per- 
iod of from ten to a hundred fifty 



thousand years. Of course, that is 
merely a first approximation; I 
would have to get further data be- 
fore making any flat statement.” 

“You’ve checked your Star 
Catalogue?” Morgan asked. 

“I have. There are eight possi- 
bilities; the data on all are both 
old and meager. There is also a 
good probability that the binary 
is unlisted in the Catalogue.” 

Mikko looked thoughtfully at 
the glowing overhead and stroked 
his beard. “It looks very much 
like what the Brotherhood thought 
was a planet falling on them 
eighty-three years ago was an 
A-5 star. It’s probably a very good 
thing they left. Morgan, what is 
the probability that Quindar’s en- 
gineers — or other personnel, for 
that matter — suspect that there 
was something incongruous about 
that explosion?” 

“Small, I’d say. Look at it: The 
power required to energize an or- 
dinary inverse space tube requires 
a hell of a lot of heavy equipment, 
even with superconductors in the 
hundred-degrees-Absolute range. 
I couldn’t have put it in such a 
small space if I’d intended to sta- 
bilize it. I just overloaded the cir- 
cuits and let ’em blow. Those 
five-millimeter silver rods flashed 
into plasma in six milliseconds — 
half again as long as I had any 
right to expect. The Bender fusion 
batteries blew, oh, maybe a milli- 
second later, discharged through 
the silver plasma. Big flash of

light, no damage. They wouldn’t 
think of a portal operating. Since 
it’s normally used after it’s been 
established at both ends — and 
there’s such a slight energy drain 
once it’s stabilized — I doubt if 
they’d make the connection. The 
most likely explanation would be 
that the scoop field blew when the 
scoop ripped off.” 

Mikko nodded. “Excellent. 
Then it’s highly unlikely that 
they’ll be expecting us. 

“Tress, taking into account the 
time between the takeoff of the 
Umpaul Raatgarten and the flash 
through the inverse space tube, 
and the pseudovelocity of the ship, 
find that binary for us.” 
“Computing,” said Tress.

ttlJREAKOUT, gentlemen,” 
JC^Tress announced. There was 
a slight lurch, accompanied by an 
audible click and a subtle feeling of 
continuous deceleration as the 
gravity field rephased. 

The three-fourths of the team 
that were not built into the ship 
had gathered in the control room, 
each in the compleat designed for 
him. The two humans’ compleats 
resembled overstuffed executive 
chairs, and Metrak’s looked like a 
squashed trundle-bed. 

Mikko hunched forward to ex- 
amine the available readouts. 
“What does it look like?” 

“Information is not yet com- 



plete,” Tress answered him testily. 

“When will you know if this is 
the system?” Morgan asked. 

“The probability is point nine- 
nine-three that this is the system,” 
Tress replied. Two lights appeared 
on an overhead screen. “This is 
the G-3 star. This other is the 
A-5.” A dotted line sprang out 
from one light, assuming an egg- 
shape which circled the other light, 
then ran off the screen. “That’s a 
first approximation of the orbit. 
I’ll need about two standard days’ 
observations to refine it.” Three 
more lights appeared, one with a 
more nearly circular dotted line. 
“There are the observable planets. 
I have one orbit — no, two.” A sec- 
ond dotted circle appeared. 

“Which are the planets we’re 
looking for?” Metrak asked. 

“Here’s another,” Tress said, 
lighting another spot on the screen. 
“The second out from the sun 
would appear to be the Earthlike 
one. The fourth — no, fifth — ” she 
added another dot after the second 
“ — will be the planet that ap- 
proaches the A-5 star as it reaches 
apasteron. The closest point will 
occur in slightly under two stan- 
dard years. It will graph like this 
— ” The two dots moved in their 
orbits until they met and appeared 
to merge. Then the dot represent- 
ing the star pulled ahead of the 
planetary dot in its fall toward 
apasteron. “Here are the figures 
— ” A page of formulae appeared 
on the screen.

“Thank you, Tress,” Morgan 
said. “Thank you very much.” He 
swung his compleat around to face 
his companions. “Well, we’ve 
found it. What now?” 

“Now,” said Mikko Falkyn- 
berg decisively, “we sneak into a 
high orbit over that- inner planet 
and take a long look at what is 
going on down there. Tress, we 
want a nearly circular, transpolar 
orbit at about two diameters out, 
with a minimum use of power — 
drive muffled and as little radia- 
tion as possible.” 

“Computing,” Tress acknowl- 
edged. 

It took time. Time to fall into 
the prescribed orbit, time to take 
the careful observations of the sur- 
face, time to analyze the meanings 
of the recordings. During that time 
four ships under full operating 
power came, stayed and went from 
the planet’s surface. Tress report- 
ed faithfully that each of them had 
come from the cold outer planet 
and returned there. 

Morgan was asleep after gruel- 
ing hours of work the previous day 
when Mikko said to Tress: “Let 
me see Eighty-four Zeta again.” 
“Area Zeta, Composite Eighty- 
four,” Tress announced as she lit 
up a screen. On it appeared a por- 
tion of the planet’s surface. 

Because of the planetwide 
change in weather the cloud cover 
was dense and widespread. Each 
time Tress had taken a shot, she 
had made a probability estimate of 



the actual surface she could see 
and ignored the clouds. After 
eighty-four separate shots, the 
composite map was bare of clouds. 

Mikko stared at it for several 
minutes, then nodded. “Yes. 
That’s it. Up here — he tapped 
the screen with his stylus — “are 
the big plants. Probably mining 
and smelting. Spacefield over here. 
All fine. But — ” he dropped the 
point of his stylus a hundred and 
thirty kilometers to the south — 
“what is this? Another spaceport?” 

“Possibly. It reminds me of 
something else,” Mikko said 
thoughtfully. “Check this against 
the shots of the Brotherhood’s new 
planet — the shots showing the vil- 
lage.” 

“Ah,” Tress said after a few 
seconds. “You’re right, Mikko. 
There is a definite similarity. That 
is most probably the village built 
by the Brotherhood when they 
lived here.” 

“Are there any indications that 
it is being used presently?” 

“None.” 

Mikko smiled with satisfaction. 
“Excellent. That gives us our ap- 
proach. Now, how about Quin- 
dar’s communications?” 

He wasn’t asking about com- 
munications through an inverse 
space tube. An inverse space tube 
is not, of course, a tube, but it can 
be thought of as one. Two 
matched portals, when energized, 
correspond to two ends of a tube. 
Or, more exactly, to opposite sides 



FIMBULSOMMER 



31 




of a disk of zero thickness, no 
matter how distant they were from 
each other in “real” space. The 
initial energization requires tre- 
mendous power, but it can be 
maintained with only a trickle of 
current after the match is stabil- 
ized. 

Early mathematical treatment 
of inverse space indicated that any- 
thing moving through inverse 
space experienced negative time. 
If, for instance, one end happened 
to be exactly one light-year from 
the other, anything traversing the 
“tube” would emerge from the 
portal a year earlier than it had 
started. That proved to involve an 
insoluble paradox. The fact is that 
the time involved is zero; two por- 
tals are opposite sides of a single 
mathematically two-dimensional 
disc. Obviously, no material parti- 
cle can go through the “tube.” 
Only particles having an intrinsic 
velocity of c — photons and neu- 
trinos — can jump the interface. 

Communication via inverse 
space requires only a couple of 
ordinary ten-milliwatt handphones, 
but there is no way to tap the line, 
for the communication does not 
exist in “real” space. 

However, although the amount 
of power required to maintain the 
tube is small, setting it up initially 
requires a great deal of power, and 
there is no point in that at merely 
planetary distances. Tress could 
easily tap their comm lines. 

“The probability is point nine- 



seven-three,” she said, “that they 
are mining and smelting copper. 
But I do not understand the high 
breakdown factor of their working 
units. Working units should not 
break down that often.” 

“I agree,” said Mikko slowly. 
“The trouble with their troubles is 
that they are apparently not trou- 
bled by them.” 

“I wish you wouldn’t do that,” 
said Tress in a plaintive tone. 
“You used the word ‘trouble’ in at 
least two and more probably three 
different ways. And your pronouns 
are vague. I do not understand.” 
“Neither do 1,” said Morgan 
from the control door, “but not 
for the same reason.” 

“I mean,” Mikko said distinctly 
and somewhat testily, “that I’m 
bothered by the fact that the dif- 
ficulties they seem to be having 
are apparently not disturbing 
them.” 

“Noted — filed for correlation,” 
said Tress. “May I ask your basis?” 
“Just what I was wondering,” 
Morgan said. 

“That group of messages,” 
Mikko explained, “all say some- 
thing like: ‘Five working units non- 
functional. Four additional units 
required. Send nine units.’ And 
back comes the reply: ‘Nine units 
will be shipped within twelve 
hours.’ 

“Nobody ever says: ‘We are 
running short of units.’ Or: ‘Those 
things cost money.’ Or: ‘Repair 
old units.’ Morgan, if these boys

are running this enterprise on a 
thread — which they must be to 
make a killing on the payoff — why 
aren’t they more careful with their 
investments?” 

Metrak, who had been dozing 
quietly in his compleat for the past 
several hours, opened one anthri- 
cite eye. “Why do we not go down 
and see?” 

“Thank you, Professor,” Mik- 
ko said. “I was about to suggest 
exactly that.” 

S OME two hours later, the Pec - 
cavi, a space yacht of Beedirn 
registry which looked suspiciously 
like the Trespassers W if you had 
a nasty, suspicious mind, fell in an 
injured-drive-tube way into a close 
orbit about the planet, beaming a 
distress signal on all appropriate 
frequencies. 

After two orbits, when it had be- 
come obvious to the Quindar men 
who were observing her that the 
problem ship would not go away 
or explode or in some other way 
solve the problem by herself, the 
ship’s comscreen lit up to display 
a simple test pattern. 

“What ship is that?” the pattern 
asked in a young-sounding male 
voice. 

“Peccavi, out of Beedirn,” 
Morgan replied. 

“What class?” 

“Private registry,” Morgan 
said, fingering his ruffed collar 
with just the proper air of bored 
aristocracy. 



Tress’s voice whispered in his 
ear. “Photo laser pulse just ended. 
That’s the fourth. There have been 
three scans with sigma search- 
beams and there is almost contin- 
uous radar.” 

“Maybe they’re doing an al- 
bum,” Morgan murmured. 

“What seems to be the trou- 
ble?” the test pattern asked. 

“Don’t really know,” Morgan 
said. “Something about the tubes 
or some such. Something about 
patterns, you know.” 

“Depatternization of the tube 
cathodes?” 

“That’s the phrase,” Morgan 
said gratefully. “The ship knows 
what’s wrong. Says we can’t go 
any farther until the tube thingies 
are fixed. Permission requested to 
land and make necessary repairs. 
We’ll pay, of course.” 

A dull humming sound came 
through the speakers as the micro- 
phone at the other end was cut off. 
The people on the planet were pre- 
sented with a problem. What they 
wanted, it was clear, was for the 
ship to go away as fast as possible. 
But under one of the few univer- 
sally recognized laws, the Uniform 
Universal Space Calamity Act, a 
ship requesting aid or assistance of 
an inhabited planet, outpost, min- 
ing "or research station had to be 
granted such aid. If they refused 
to help, they would have more — 
and more official — company nos- 
ing around as soon as the incident 
was reported.

The test pattern was replaced by 
a close-in teleview of a dark, tri- 
angular head, rising from pointed 
chin to flat-cut hair. Wide set eyes 
balanced over a small nose, cen- 
tered above thin lips, which moved: 
“Greetings. I apologize for the de- 
lay. My subordinate had to inform 
me of your request.” 

I'll bet, Morgan thought. 

“Of course you must land as 
soon as possible. We should be 
able to effect repairs to your yacht 
almost immediately. There’ll be 
no question of payment.” 

“I humbly thank you, esteemed 
sir. We shall try not to impose on 
your hospitality.” 

“Yes,” Thinlips agreed. “You 
have, naturally, had your quara- 
mine vitus inoculations?” 

“Our who?” Morgan asked. 
“Quaramine vitus. It’s a plas- 
moid disease indigenous to this 
planet.” 

“Never heard of it,” Morgan 
said truthfully. “I guess we’ll have 
to take the inoculatioqj when we 
land.” 

Thinlips shook his head regret- 
fully. “I am sorry, but the inocu- 
lation takes two weeks to produce 
the required antibodies. I must re- 
quest you to remain in the ship 
with the airlock sealed and allow 
us to make the repairs. I’ll see that 
the landing beacon is turned on 
now — just follow it in.” 

Morgan said, “I must thank 
you for your aid and considera- 
tion.” 



Thinlips nodded and blanked off. 

Mikko Falkynberg leaned back 
and folded his arms across his 
heavy chest. “Well? Correct me if 
I was wrong.” 

Before Morgan could speak, 
Tress said: “No correction neces- 
sary. You said that they would 
have an apparently valid excuse to 
keep the three of you sealed in.” 

Morgan smiled far too sweetly. 
“And he was right. Very well, 
Tress, my love — execute the 
Falkynberg plan.” 

Trespassers W began dropping 
toward the Quindar spaceport in 
a neat landing orbit while the men 
below watched it carefully on their 
tracer screens: 

All seemed to be well for the 
first few minutes. 

Then the ship lurched suddenly 
and slid off her orbit, moving 
southward. 

“ Peccavi V snapped one of the 
watchers. “What’s the idea, 
there?” 

“Not our idea, I assure you,” 
came the cultured voice. “The 
drive’s bucking up. We’re trying 
to correct.” 

“Get back on the prescribed 
landing orbit — or you’ll crash!” 

“We know,” Morgan said, sud- 
denly harsh. “Leave us alone so 
we can correct.” 

The thin-lipped man cut off his 
voice pickup. And grinned. “All 
right,” he said, “let ’em crack up. 
Save us a lot of trouble, and it will 
look right on the records.”

IF 




On the screens the ship buckled 
and twisted, as if trying to regain 
control of a terribly faulty drive. 

Morgan, Mikko and Metrak, 
couched in their compleats, still 
felt the surges and accelerations 
that assaulted them, but Tress had 
computed her antics to a nicety. 
At the last moment, she braked, 
swerved, settled and came down 
neatly to a relatively soft landing 
in the middle of the square in the 
center of the long-deserted Broth- 
erhood village. 



T HE men in the Quindar space- 
port hunched forward in their 
chairs like a group of ill-controlled 
marionettes, waiting. Thinlips 
turned from the radar screen to 
check an oscillocom reading. He 
stared at it expressionlessly for a 
long moment and announced: 
“They’ve landed.” 

“Good!” A short man in back 
of the room pushed away from his 
chair and started pacing the floor, 
his arms locked behind him. Thin 
black hair brushed neatly away 
from his high, domed forehead, 
severe, almost military clothing 
and a certain precision of manner 
gave him an air of importance that 
somehow made him seem even 
shorter — not merely a small man 
but the king of the midgets. “You 
must send someone out to inspect 
the wreckage. Where did they 
crash?” 

“They didn’t crash, Mister 



Goodbit, they landed. The seismo 
would have indicated a crash.” 
“Landed?” Goodbit stopped 
pacing. “What does that mean? 
Where? We must send an inspec- 
tion team at once!” 

“Yessir. As soon as I — ” 

The comscreen lit. “Help! Can 
you hear me? Send someone to 
help, please!” The screen showed 
the control room of the Peccavi, 
which was filled with billowing 
clouds of dense, gray smoke. 
Tongues of flame licked up from 
behind a twisted panel in the back- 
ground. The image was so realistic 
that the watchers could almost 
smell the burning insulation. 
“Help,” the coughing face in the 
screen pleaded, tears streaming 
from the corners of reddened eyes. 

Richtman hit the call button. “I 
hear you. What happened?” 

“I don’t know. We hit the 
ground and smoke started coming 
out of everything and nothing 
works and we can’t — ” The screen 
went blank. 

“They — ah — seem to be having 
trouble,” Goodbit said with a 
slight smile. 

“Yessir. I’ll send a cargo aircar 
out as soon as I can get some fire- 
fighting equipment aboard,” Richt- 
man said, swiveling in his chair. 

“Now, now, Richtman; let us 
not be hasty. Precipitous action 
is always to be avoided. We must 
consider the situation.” 

“Excuse me. Mister Goodbit, 
but what’s to consider? If we don’t 



F I MBU LSOAAAAE R 



35 




get there quickly they’ll probably 
burn to death!” 

“So?” Goodbit’s eyes flashed. 
“You may be right. Yes, on con- 
sideration I think you are right. 
We must certainly get help to the 
poor, unfortunate crew of that 
vessel. Load the aircar — but not in 
haste, you understand. Set out for 
the wreck as soon as the car is 
loaded. Take along a photogra- 
pher so we may record the details 
of the demise of the victims of this 
terrible crash — we must make up 
a full report to send to Beedirn. 
What a pity.” 

“Very good, sir,” Richtman 
said. “All deliberate speed it is. I 
hope they don’t send an investiga- 
tion committee.” 

“I think it highly unlikely. Take 
good, clear photographs.” 

“Yessir.” 

“Now,” Goodbit dismissed the 
wrecked spacecraft with a wave of 
his well-manicured hand. “What 
about the copper situation, Dole- 
mort? The main shaft of the heat- 
sink is four days behind schedule.” 

Dolemort, a grossly fat man 
who was squeezed into one of the 
side chairs, laced his sausagelike 
fingers together nervously. “We 
can’t use any more of the locals 
and expect the food supply to keep 
up. The present, ah, working units 
are getting weak. They can’t work 
as hard.” 

“What?” Goodbit asked gently. 
“Can’t?” 

“Yes, sir, that’s right.” Dole- 



mort quivered. “The free locals 
still bring food for the, ah, im- 
pressed units — but the quality has 
gone down. There aren’t enough 
of them left.” 

“Well pick up the rest of them 
and put them to work. They don’t 
have to eat well. Throw together 
some kind of nutritional gruel out 
of the stores. We’ll get enough 
work out of them to finish the 
job.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Tell them it’s punishment for 
the man — what’s his name— that 
disappeared. They’ll understand 
that. A very moral lot.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Get up to quota,” Goodbit 
said, smiling calmly, “or I’ll stick 
a shovel in your fat hands!” Nod- 
ding to the group, he walked from 
the room. 

VII 

A S TRESS eased the outer 
door of the airlock open just 
wide enough, Mikko said: “Out, 
Professor! Bounce!” 

Metrak literally did just that — 
shot out of the airlock at better 
than two hundred kilometers per 
hour, curled himself into a ball in 
mid-flight and arched high above 
the low buildings that stood in de- 
caying ruin around the central 
square of what had been a Broth- 
erhood village more than eight 
decades before. He struck the 
ground far beyond the limits of 



36 



IF 




the dead village and rolled nearly 
half a kilometer down a rocky 
slope before coming to a halt. He 
shook himself off, flexed his in- 
credibly tough Maxaglorian mus- 
cles and scrambled up the next 
slope, heading northward at an 
easy run, averaging eighty-five kil- 
ometers an hour over the rough 
ground. 

Mikko and Morgan watched the 
screens, looking for any move- 
ment, any indication that the Pro- 
fessor had been observed. 

“Anything, Tress?” Morgan 
asked softly. 

“Nothing. There is no sign of 
radiation in the electromagnetic 
spectrum that indicates any form 
of communication nearby. The 
only anomaly is the relatively 
strong source of energy centering 
around the two-fifty to two-sixty 
gigahertz region, coming from — ” 
a picture flashed on the screen — 
“that building. A small fire, ap- 
parently dying, since the radiation 
is decreasing.” 

“Look closely at the chimney,” 
Morgan told Mikko. 

A barely visible wisp of smoke 
was coming from the crumbling 
stone tube. 

“Tress,” Morgan asked, “are 
any human beings around?” 

“The ambient temperature is al- 
most exactly three hundred de- 
grees; to detect a body radiating 
some ten degrees higher is easy at 
short range, provided insulating 
clothing is not being worn. Assum- 



ing normal human clothing for 
this temperature, and excluding 
the interior of that particular 
building, the probability is eighty- 
seven percent that there are no 
human beings within one hundred 
meters; sixty-five percent that 
there are none within five hundred 
meters. There is, however, a fifty- 
eight percent chance that there is 
at least one but not more than two 
within a thousand meters.” 

“Check vertical heat convection 
currents,” Morgan said. 

“I did.” There was indignation 
in her voice. “Mikko’s instruction 
383P584DD-CHARDEX. Do you 
wish a readout?” 

“No,” said Morgan. He looked 
at Mikko, who was regarding the 
scene with narrowed eyes. “Any 
ideas?” 

“Certainly,” said Mikko with- 
out turning his head. “A good 
many. It might, for instance, be a 
volcanic fumarole. Tress?” 

“A probability of point oh-oh- 
four.” 

Mikko was unperturbed. “The 
two most likely situations, as I see 
it are: One, that whoever built that 
fire is — or are — still inside, which 
would make them difficult to de- 
tect against the background radi- 
ation; two, that whoever built it 
heard us dropping down and fled 
precipitately to the hinterlands. 
Tress?” 

“Indeterminable. Your guess is 
as good as mine,” said Tress. 

Mikko thinned his lips but said 



FIMBULSOMAAER 



37 




nothing. Morgan had sneaked that 
phrase in and Mikko knew it. 

“Whoever built that fire is most 
assuredly not part of the secretive 
group at Quindar’s spaceport,” 
Morgan offered. “Probability, I’d 
say, over ninety-five percent.” 
“Tress?” Mikko asked. 

In a sardonic, sing-song voice, 
Tress said, “The computation of 
human motivation is beyond the 
capability of my programing.” 

“So? Well, as my great grand- 
father is reputed to have said be- 
fore the action that won him his 
third Nova, there’s probably noth- 
ing to it — but we’d better go take 
a look.” 

“I tip my hat to your great 
grandfather,” Morgan said. “Let 
us deploy and reconnoiter. Swords 
and bucklers for the landing party 
if you please, Tress.” 

A concealed locker door slid 
open, revealing a row of sidearms: 
Course-Berryman handguns, with 
their bulbous grips and fragile- 
looking, translucent blue tubes; 
squat Delancing pistols, firing an- 
aesthetizing darts; heavy, beauti- 
fully machined MacGregor slug- 
throwers; and slender Whompers. 
The gunbelts and holsters were 
neatly hanging from a line of 
hooks above. In the drawers below 
were ammunition, cleaning and 
repair equipment and spare parts. 
Shoulder-stock and heavier weap- 
ons were in the next two lockers. 

“I’ll take a Delancing,” Morgan 
decided, wrapping the appropriate 



belt tightly around his middle. 

“I’m a traditionalist,” Mikko 
declared, buckling on the massive 
MacGregor. 

“I’ll see if I can ship you up a 
crossbow,” said Morgan. “Let’s 
head out by the number-three 
hatch, so we can circle around to 
the building without being seen.” 

“A crossbow?” Mikko consid- 
ered. “I have no quarrel with 
that.” 

Tress dilated the lock as they 
reached it. “Goodbye,” she said, 
contracting it behind them. “A 
high proportional probability of 
success on your venture.” 

“What’s that?” Mikko asked. 

“Good luck.” 

Mikko glared at Morgan, who 
did his best to look innocent. 
Neither of them spoke as they 
reached the nearest of the crumb- 
ling houses, long deserted by the 
Brotherhood, and started working 
their way around toward the thin 
wisp of smoke. No words were 
necessary to this pair, who had 
worked together for longer than 
either liked to admit, except in 
serious emergencies. Normal op- 
erations went as smoothly as 
though their four hands were con- 
trolled from a single brain. 

They worked their way around 
the second corner of the square 
and picked carefully through the 
rubble toward their objective. 
Nothing else was moving; the 
smoke from the chimney, now re- 
duced to a rising haze, was the 



38 



IF 




only sign of life they could detect. 
At the back of the building they 
flattened themselves against the 
wall on each side of the alleyway 
that led to the rear door. 

“Tradesmen’s entrance?” Mor- 
gan asked quietly. 

“Garbage disposal,” Mikko 
told him. “Leads to what passes 
for a kitchen. Me first.” 

“Right.” 

Mikko pulled the MacGregor 
from its holster and led the way 
gingerly down the narrow alley. 
He heard a soft thud behind him 
and turned to see Morgan pitching 
forward to the ground. 

He sensed a flicker of motion 
above him — but before his eyes 
had a chance to focus on it a sharp 
pain shot through the side of his 
head and the ground rose up to 
cushion him. There was a ringing 
in his brain and no feeling. 

VIII 

P ROFESSOR METRAK of 
Maxaglor viewed the scene in 
the smoking valley below with the 
dispassionate eyes of the scholar. 
His brain recorded. There was no 
way of communicating with Tress; 
the Quindar people would have 
every detector they had open and 
ready, looking for any sort of 
communication. An FM laser 
might have been fairly safe but a 
couple of mountains stood be- 
tween Metrak and Tress, neither 



of which was observably transpar- 
ent. 

He had already seen two big 
transport aircars lift up high and 
drift southward at no great rate. 
They were, he was certain, “res- 
cuers” who were, understandably 
enough, not in any big hurry to 
arrive at their destination. But 
they had climbed high quickly in 
order to be in the line of sight of 
the putative Peccavi. They probably 
did not really expect anything but 
they would be fools indeed if they 
failed to take every precaution. 

Metrak had no fear that they 
would spot him from the air. A 
Maxaglorian’s energy require- 
ments were such that, to him the 
phrase “conservation of energy” 
referred to a biological necessity 
rather than a law of physics. His 
hide was tougher than wrought 
iron and harder than tungsten car- 
bide, but its heat conductivity was 
a variable controlled by his ner- 
vous system. He could hold his 
heat as easily as he could hold his 
breath, and his highly efficient 
metabolic processes did not gen- 
erate much waste heat. 

As far as optical spotting was 
concerned, he was only another 
oddly shaped black boulder among 
many oddly shaped black boulders. 

Below him the valley smoked. 

With one of his hands he eased 
the binocular surveyor from the 
special pouch under his belly and, 
bracing himself carefully, applied 



FIMBULSOAAMER 



39 




his obsidian eyes to the eyecups. 
His fingers manipulated the con- 
trols on either side, shifting the 
lined reticule which framed his 
field of vision. 

The great open-pit mine was 
roughly circular and some six 
point four kilometers in diameter. 
It had obviously been worked for 
many years. 

The smoke came from the 
smelters over to the north, three 
point one kilometers away. The 
air reeked of sulfur dioxide in the 
air. 

That, Metrak told himself with 
satisfaction, was one way Quindar 
was saving money. No anti-pollu- 
tion devices, a crime ranked as a 
felony on any settled planet. 

Metrak flicked the zoom con- 
trol and centered in on a long line 
of workers moving truckloads of 
ore up the spiral road from the 
central depths of the mine toward 
the upper periphery. They were 
large (by Metrak’s standards), 
furry beings with thin, scale-cov- 
ered legs and arms. Their heads 
would have reminded Metrak of 
an English sheepdog, had he ever 
had the fortune to observe a speci- 
men of that breed, which had only 
a few years before been recreated 
after centuries of genetic abey- 
ance. 

A sudden movement caught the 
professor’s eye. He moved his bi- 
noc a little to center the area 
where the action was taking place. 

One of the autochthons had fal- 



len. As Metrak watched, the bird- 
like extremities drew into the hair 
covering the body, the head pulled 
in until it was only a slight bulge 
on the nearly spherical ball. The 
result looked something like a 
large beachball made of yak hide. 

The recording camera in the 
binoc hummed an almost inaudible 
D-flat as the little being watched. 

The line of native orebearers 
stopped. Metrak heard a noise 
very faintly from below. One of 
his middle hands took out a col- 
lapsed sound pickup, expanded it 
and clipped it to the side of the 
binoc; automatically focusing the 
sound intensifier on the scene he 
was watching. 

The faint sound became a high 
keening as Metrak clipped the but- 
ton speaker over his earslot. He 
backed off the zoom on the binoc 
to take in more of the scene and 
went on watching and listening. 
The keening continued, the ore- 
bearers staying in place around 
their fallen comrade. 

After several minutes a small 
observation platform, looking like 
a flying bridge table, skimmed 
over to the stopped workers and 
settled softly until its ground-ef- 
fect cage touched the dirt. One of 
the two humans on it unclipped 
himself from his harness and 
climbed down, while the other 
stayed behind the control stick, 
hefting a large shock-gun and 
looking nervous. 

“Howja figure it?”- the one who 



40 



IF 




climbed down asked, his voice 
coming in small and clear over 
Metrak’s button speaker. “One 
minute the hairball’s workin’ 
along fine, the next he’s keeled 
over and tucked up.’’ He bent over 
to examine the furry beachball. 

“Just another deader,’’ the one 
on the platform said. “Come on, 
let’s get out of here.’’ 

“Don’t be so nervous. Just keep 
that gun handy. Yah, this’s a dead- 
er.’’ He looked around at the clus- 
ter of natives. “You and you — get 
rid of ’im!’’ He waved a hand at 
the featureless ball of hair at his 
feet. “And back quick, you un- 
derstand Back quick or we give 
your friends a dose!’’ He waved at 
his buddy on the platform, who 
brandished his shock-gun men- 
acingly. 

“Unnastan!’’ said one of the 
two chosen autochthons in a high, 
buzzy voice. “Bag gwig! No gill 
frems! Bag gwig!’’ 

“All right! Get movin’, then. 
Go!’’ 

The two chosen ones moved 
rapidly, grabbing their fallen com- 
rade by clutching their three-fin- 
gered talons in its hair and trot- 
ting off. 

The keening stopped. 

“All right! Move it!” said the 
human with the shock-gun. But his 
command was unnecessary; the 
orebearers had already begun to 
go on with their task. 

Metrak followed the departing 
funeral procession in his binoc un- 



til he saw it vanish over the crest 
of a distant hill. Then he packed 
up his equipment and departed — 
stealthily at first, then gaining 
speed, moving circuitously after 
the pair of autochthons until he 
had them back in sight. 

The natives and their burden, 
with Metrak a distance behind 
them, soon arrived at their des- 
tination. It was a narrow valley 
through which ran a snowmelt- 
swollen, swift-running river. 

Without ceremony they placed 
their furball burden on the bank of 
the river, a few meters from the 
water’s edge, then took off back 
the way they had come. 

Metrak stayed and watched. 

Some time later a large raft ap- 
peared upstream. Made up of bun- 
dles of small logs, it was roughly 
triangular in shape with the blunt 
end forward and two long sides 
leading to a pointed stern. Along 
both sides were a row of natives 
with thick poles, trying to keep 
the unwieldy craft steady in the 
rapid river current. 

One of the autochthons spotted 
the body. It screeched something 
Metrak didn’t understand and the 
group poled to shore. As the raft 
got closer to where Metrak 
crouched behind a convenient rock 
on the ridge line overlooking the 
river, he could see that the central 
area of the craft was filled with 
contracted autochthons like the 
one on the bank. 

Two of the polers hopped 



FIAABULSOAAMER 



41 




ashore, grabbed the body and 
swung it aboard. Then they jumped 
back themselves and resumed their 
places as the raft continued its per- 
ilous way downstream. 

When the raft was well past him, 
Metrak leaped up to the ridge line 
and, breaking into an easy lope, 
began to follow it. 

M ORGAN OXBO reflected 
dimly on the fact that his 
back was cold. And uncomfort- 
able. A voice was niggling at his 
brain. 

“My dear Morgan, do yourself 
the favor of waking up. If you 
keep lying on this cold stone you 
will get a devil of a chill — and I 
am not in any condition to hold 
you in my arms. Besides, I just 
saw your eyelids flutter.” A pause. 
Then: “Dammit, Morgan! Wake 
up!” 

He opened his eyes. The white 
light of a sun seen from entirely 
too close seared his vision, accom- 
panied by a thunder of pain. His 
eyes blinked shut but the pain did 
not go away. He groaned. 

“That’s a start, dear friend. 
That’s a start. Open your eyes. 
Not that there’s anything to see — 
but you’ve got to get up before 
your back freezes solid to the 
stone. Come on, now — open your 
eyes.” 

Morgan tried again. This time 
it was a little better. The sun 
seemed to have receded a bit. The 
pain was constant, but pain can be 



handled. He blinked several times 
and the blinding light slowly died 
down to a greenish blue as his 
irises contracted to the appropri- 
ate aperture. “Mikko?” he asked. 

“In the flesh. Very much in the 
flesh. How do you feel?” 

The blur took shape. Mikko 
towered over him. Something was 
strange. “I don’t know how I — ow 
— feel. Is the back of my head still 
connected to the front?” 

“As far as I can tell. You were 
struck by a rock about the size of 
your fist, judging by the bruised 
area. Skin broken, surface bleed- 
ing, but no deeper damage. Don’t 
feel alone — I was similarly treated. 
I must have a harder head.” 

Morgan tried shaking his head 
to clear away the fuzziness but the 
back of his skull protested sharply. 
He sat up and was rewarded with a 
wave of nausea. After threatening 
his stomach a while, it passed, and 
his brain gave signs of starting to 
function. “Where are we?” He 
looked up at Mikko and realized 
what had seemed strange before. 
“Mikko, you’re naked!” 

Mikko was bouncing from foot 
to foot and slapping his arms 
across his belly to warm up. “I 
am. You are. It would seem. to be 
the way of the world in our rather 
confined quarters.” 

“I am? I am! That’s why I’m so 
cold. Where are we? And what, in 
the name of the Seven Aspects, 
happened?” He looked around. 
The stone floor on which he was

sitting spread out in all directions 
to form the base of a square 
room. The walls, also of stone, 
rose up to a height of about three 
meters before being capped by a 
domed slab ceiling. Greenish light 
seeped in through two vine-cov- 
ered slits in the far wall. An odor 
of mildew pervaded the damp chill 
air. 

Running across the room from 
left to right stood a row of closely 
spaced iron bars, anchored in floor 
and ceiling — they cut the room 
into two unequal rectangles. The 
only entrance to the room was on 
the other side of the bars — a low, 
iron door set into the far wall. Be- 
tween the two men and the bars 
ran a small river. 

“We,” said Mikko, “are in a 
contemplation cell — the Brother- 
hood’s contribution to the science 
of penology. The gentleman in the 
corner has been contemplating for 
quite some time now.” 

“Brotherhood?” Morgan rubbed 
his aching head and tried to focus 
his eyes on a dimly perceptible fig- 
ure lying in fetal sleep on a mound 
of something in the corner. “How 
did they get into this? I mean here 
and now.” * 

“They aren’t here and now,” 
said Mikko, “but this is one of 
their relics. I have seen their latest 
model. Almost ended up in it. It’s 
designed to allow one to contem- 
plate one’s sins until one repents 
of them. This place is almost iden- 
tical.” He swung his left arm in an 



arc, palm upward. “This was or- 
iginally a small stream. It enters 
through a hole some thirty centi- 
meters on a side and originally 
flowed through a shallow trough 
of the same dimensions and on 
through the exit, over to your 
right. Drinking water to the left, 
sanitary facilities to the right. 
Simple, eh?” 

“Very,” said Morgan, carefully 
exploring the knot on the right 
side of his head. “You call it sim- 
ple, I call it barbaric. But we 
agree.” 

“Thank you. At its best, this 
place was never comfortable. The 
ten-degree slope toward that open 
drain wouldn’t be easy to sleep on 
— and the slope from left to right 
is fifteen to eighteen degrees.” 

“That flow before us is no small 
stream,” Morgan said. “It’s damn 
near a river. Since the Brother- 
hood left, the ice to the north has 
been melting. We have a flood 
here, Mikko.” 

“Exactly,” Mikko said agree- 
ably. “That rivulet is now over a 
meter deep in the center and even 
deeper to the right. I assume we 
were brought in across the left end, 
where it’s narrower and shallower. 
Up there, you see, where the wa- 
ters do not yet wash the bars. 
There’s a door in the bars, if you 
will notice.” 

“You’ve tried it,” Morgan said. 
A statement, not a question. 

“Of course. A simple lock. You 
and I have extricated ourselves

M IKKO Falkynberg clenched 
his right hand and slammed 
the fist into his left palm. “I con- 
fess to stupidity, my dear Mor- 
gan. The Brotherhood never men- 
tioned any local intelligent life 
forms and I made the assumption 
that there were none. Worse, they 
stated that there were no intelli- 
gent natives — and I believed 
them.” 

“Why should they lie?” Morgan 
asked. 

“Exactly. They didn’t.” 

“You mean they never saw the 
native beings?” Morgan looked 
puzzledly at Mikko. 

“No, the natives were seen, all 
right. And described to me. And 
that is why I am culpable. I failed 
to allow for the Brotherhood’s 
blind spot. By their religious be- 
liefs, there are no true beings ex- 
cept those of Terran descent. All 
others are animals.” He glowered 
at the far wall. “I should have 
known.” 

“Have you actually seen the 
locals?” Morgan asked. 

“Certainly.” Mikko took a 
deep breath. “They brought us our 
lunch.” 

Morgan suddenly realized that 
the pain was not all centered in his 
head; part of it lay growling in his 
abdomen. “Food? Where? Is there 
any left?” 

Mikko gestured toward a slate 
slab on the sloping floor a few feet 
away. “Help yourself.” 

Chilled to the bone, Morgan 



walked over to the slab and squat- 
ted down. He saw a pile of gray- 
green, soggy-looking lumps. Pick- 
ing up one of the lumps, he bit off 
a small portion and chewed it. It 
tasted something like boiled saw- 
dust, with a delicate dusting of 
sand, exquisitely spiced with ep- 
som salts. 

He spat. “How’s the water?” 

“Try it,” Mikko said. “Care- 
fully.” 

Morgan approached the edge of 
the water, which looked blue-green 
in the filtered light, and put a hand 
in. “Ice cold! Brrr!” He splashed 
some on his face, which made him 
feel better, then he tasted it. “A 
little sour and metallic, but not 
too bad.” He rinsed his mouth 
with it, spat it out. “I’d hate to 
have to drink it for long. I — ” 

He was interrupted by a word- 
less scream. 

Morgan and Mikko spun 
around to find their cellmate sit- 
ting up on his mound. His skinny 
arm was stretched out and a bony 
finger pointed at them. “Get out!” 
he screamed. “I see you there — 
you can’t fool me again!” His skin 
was taut over his ribs and shoul- 
ders and his pale, gaunt face held 
deep-set eyes, framed by wide, 
black circles. “Away!” he yelled. 
“Leap up with whips and flay — 
more work today!” His voice rose 
to a high scream and he pitched 
over backwards and lay silent. 

“What,” Morgan demanded, 
“was that all about?” 



46 



IF 




“I don’t know,” Mikko told 
him. “He seemed to be lucid when 
I talked to him before. He had 
trouble staying awake long enough 
to talk and was obviously very 
sick — but not delerious.” 

“Nightmare,” Morgan sug- 
gested. They went over to the 
sleeping man and looked closely 
at him. “I have no idea what to do 
for him. Do you?” 

“Yes,” Mikko said. “Get him 
out of here. Also get us out of 
here before we catch whatever he’s 
got.” 

“What’s that he’s lying on?” 
Morgan asked, staring down at the 
black, lumpy surface. 

“I’d say it was straw once, 
about eighty-five years ago be- 
fore the Brotherhood left. Call it 
what you want to now.” 

“Argh!” Morgan exclaimed, 
rubbing his side. “It’s cold in here. 
How do we get out?” 

“You tell me,” Mikko suggest- 
ed. “Those wrought-iroti bars have 
a surface coating of rust but 
they’re still solid after all this 
time. If they hadn’t taken all our 
clothes we could call Tress or the 
Professor.” 

“If they hadn’t taken all our 
clothes I wouldn’t be so cold,” 
Morgan said. “Maybe if we yelled 
Tress would hear us. Do you know 
what part of the square this here 
jail is at?” 

“If it’s built the same way the 
Brotherhood built the one on their 
new planet, it’s about five kilo- 



meters out of town. I can’t yell 
that loud.” 

“Why so far?” 

Mikko shrugged. “Isolation 
mostly. Except for the once-a- 
day visit by whoever brought his 
food, anyone in — ah — contempla- 
tion wouldn’t see or talk to a 
soul.” 

Morgan waded across the nar- 
row part of the water supply and 
pulled at the bars. “Solid. The 
Brotherhood built for the ages, 
unfortunately.” He splashed back 
and sat down, then changed his 
mind and stood back up. “What’s 
our mad friend doing in here?” 

. “He’s with Quindar. Thinks we 
are too, so if he wakes up sane 
don’t say him nay. The natives 
captured him for revenge, evident- 
ly.” 

“Revenge, huh? They’re being 
mistreated?” 

“Quindar’s got some mines in 
the hills. They’re fabricating equip- 
ment up there. Using the natives 
as slave labor in the mines and 
plants.” 

“ Yeesh ,” Morgan muttered, 
wiping at his legs with his hands, 
trying to get the water off, “that 
is cold enough to ruin a billiard 
table. Slavery? Slavery isn’t prof- 
itable.” 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” said 
Mikko. “It often has been, it can 
be, and in the present circum- 
stances it is. Why do you think we 
aren’t dead?” 

The apparent change of subject

didn’t faze Morgan Oxbo; he was 
used to Mikko’s mental opera- 
tions. “That had occurred to me. 
Why?’’ 

“As my sainted great grand- 
uncle, the last Bishop of Domer- 
meve said, just before his martyr- 
dom, These are a gentle people.’ ’’ 

“I rejoice that they are not vi- 
cious,’’ Morgan said, gently touch- 
ing his head with numb fingers. 
“So?’’ 

“According to what I gleaned 
from our recumbent cellmate,” 
Mikko continued, “the local gen- 
try are a gregarious, highly so- 
cialized species. Capture a group 
of them and each will work to keep 
his friends and relatives from be- 
ing harmed; furthermore, other 
friends and relatives will actually 
bring them foocT if permitted to do 
so. They are generally docile and 
have the approximate intelligence 
of a medium-grade moron.” 

Morgan nodded. “What a sweet 
setup for slavery. And I suppose 
they’ve decided to capture a few 
humans to force Quindar Incor- 
porated to stop what they’re do- 
ing. Make a fair trade and call ev- 
erything off.” 

“I assume so. They’re trying to 
take care of us, keep us healthy. 
They feed us regularly. They even 
give us a nice cool cell. To them, 
the weather out there must be blis- 
teringly hot. Poor devils; when 
that A-5 gets in close and the in- 
cident radiation is increased by 
twenty percent, they’re really going 



to know what a hot summer is. 
They—” 

Mikko was cut off by the hoarse 
voice of the third man. “Hey. Hey, 
you guys. Com’ere. Please 
com’ere.” 

“Sure, fella,” said Morgan as 
the partners walked over to the 
hummock of humus upon which 
the man lay. “Is there anything 
we can do?” He knew there wasn’t; 
if there had been, Mikko would 
have already done it. Or still be 
doing it. 

“Nah, nah. F’git it.” His voice 
was weak and slurred. He retched 
suddenly; nothing came up. “Uhhh. 
Sorrry. Sick Dizzy. Headache. 
Gutache. Uhhh!” Again he retched 
dryly. 

Mikko Falkynberg picked up 
the man’s flaccid wrist and applied 
his fingers to the artery at the base 
of the thumb. “Just take it easy, 
my friend,” he said. Pulse: soft 
and weak. Respiration : shallow 
and rapid. And, in spite of the 
chill, there was a thin film of clam- 
my sweat over the man’s skin. 

In the dim light that came from 
the leaden skies and filtered green- 
ish through the vine-covered slit 
high up in the far wall, the man 
looked ghastly. His half-closed 
eyes were obviously neither focus- 
ing nor tracking and his teeth, 
gums and tongue looked even a 
darker green than his skin. 

Suddenly, with extraordinary 
strength, he grasped Morgan’s 
hand. “Gotta get outa here, guys!” 



48 



IF 




There was strength and sanity in 
his voice despite its whispery tone 
and almost inaudible volume. 
“Those hairballs are tryin’ to kill 
us. Already got me. Poison in the 
food. I held out for a while but I 
got so hungry I hadda eat. Had 
to. Understand?” 

“Sure,” said Morgan. 

“Sure. 1 was, hell, starving hun- 
gry. Sick even then — cold, sick, 
miserable. Had to eat that slop. 
Got it down for a while, then — ” 
Again he retched, more violently 
this time, giving more meaning to 
his statement than any words 
could. 

He feebly spat out greenish sa- 
liva, swallowed dryly. For a mo- 
ment his eyes swam. Then they 
tried to focus on Mikko’s face. 

“Get out. Two guys could may- 
be get out, somehow, someway. 
Tell Goodbit. Leave me here. I’ll 
be okay. Couldn't move anyhow. 
But don’t eat the food. Dont — 
eat — the— food ! ' ’ 

He closed his eyes and was si- 
lent for a moment. Then he went 
into weak, shuddering convul- 
sions that lasted nearly ten min- 
utes while Mikko and Morgan 
held him. Then he lay still. 

Mikko checked the pulse. Noth- 
ing. He pulled a couple of hairs 
from the crown of his head and 
placed them over the man’s nos- 
trils and lips. They did not move. 

After a minute Morgan said: 
“He’s dead.” 

Mikko nodded. “And, all things 



considered, he died bravely. I won- 
der who he was.” 

IX 

T HE two cargo aircars landed 
a respectful distance from Tres- 
passers W. The belly pod of one 
opened and disgorged a fire trac- 
tor, which ground purposefully 
toward the silver egg. The white- 
clad man riding atop the tractor 
stopped his machine two meters 
from the ship. “It don’t look dam- 
aged,” he called, snapping up his 
visor. “Where’s the fire?” 

Just then a small vent popped 
open toward the bottom of the 
ship, sending up a cloud of acrid 
smoke. Then it closed. 

“Go on,” the leader of the group 
transmitted from inside the second 
aircar. “See if you can find an 
opening.” 

“Yeah,” the man agreed, kick- 
ing his machine into gear. 

Stop where you are\ Authorized

the landing fins. Trespassers will 
be prosecuted. This ship is author- 
ized to employ self-defense mea- 
sures under paragraph two hun-

Regulations. 

As the last tinny notes of the 
mechanical voice from the ship’s 
speakers died away the white-clad 
man halted his machine. 

“Go on,” the group leader 
urged. 

“Not me. I ain’t going closer.”

The group leader glared at the 
men around him. They all looked 
carefully in other directions. With 
a muttered curse he climbed down 
out of his perch and strode toward 
the ship. 

Haiti No trespassing. This is 
your second warning. 

“Is this the PeccaviV ’ the leader 
asked, stopping short some five 
meters from the nearest fin. 

Yes. 

“Let me speak to one of the 
men inside.” 

That is impossible. 

“Why?” 

They are not speaking. 

The leader considered that for 
a moment. “Where are they?” 

One is in the control room. One 
is in the forward cargo hold. 

“What are they doing?” 

They are lying on the deck. Keep 
back. 

“We have come to help them. 
You must let us in.” 

No answer. 

“Will you open the hatch?” 

No. 

The group leader coaxed and 
wheedled. The moronic robot on 
the Peccavi answered questions, 
but no more. 

“Damn!” the leader yelled, los- 
ing his patience. “Open that hatch 
— that’s an order!” 

The .computer clucked to itself 
for a moment, then announced in 
a loud voice, I will open the hatch. 

Halfway up the hull a round hole 
smoothly dilated. With a grunt of 



satisfaction, the leader started to- 
ward the ladder. 

A small, black object passed 
overhead with blurring speed and 
disappeared into the hole, which 
promptly closed. 

A spurt of fire appeared at the 
leader’s feet. I have opened the 
hatch. Keep back. 

M ETRAK ping-ponged off two 
of the walls in the inner hatch 
and almost bounced down the in- 
ternal ladderway before grabbing 
hold of a stanchion and pulling 
himself to a halt. 

“That’s an impressive way to 
enter a hatch,” Tress commented, 
dogging the pressure seal. 

“I misjudged,” Metrak said. 
“Did they see me?” 

“They did, but only as a black 
blur. Even now they are asking 
each other what it was that flew 
by.” 

“Very good.” Metrak trotted 
down the ladderway, around the 
dead-black, one-meter sphere that 
was Tress’s inner core, and into 
the control room. “I have all the 
data we need, complete with a tape 
of very incriminating pictures. 
Where are Mikko and Morgan?” 
“Not here,” Tress said. “They 
left shortly after you did.” 
“Really?” K Professor Metrak 
scratched his thick hide. “What 
for?” 

“To investigate this.” Tress 
flashed a picture of the building 
on the far side of the square onto 



50 



IF 




the main screen. “It was radiating 
in the infrared and smoke was 
coming from the chimney.” 

“And?” Metrak prompted. 

“And they are not back yet.” 
“Strange,” Metrak said. “Per- 
haps I should search for them. I’ll 
give them a while longer. What’s 
happening outside?” 

“The men in the aircars have 
communicated with the spaceport, 
and a person named Goodbit is 
coming here. They will do nothing 
until he arrives.” 

“Oh? Tress, record this for 
transmitting over the inverse space 
connection to planet London.” 
Professor Metrak balanced on four 
legs and scratched his belly 
thoughtfully. “To: Comex code 
Lloyds. We have completed our 
investigation. Subject Quindar En- 
gineering is definitely uninsurable. 
Their reason for wanting complete 
secrecy is tied in with their obvious 
underfinancing. Subject is using 
local autochthons as slave labor. 
Mining and smelting copper and 
other minerals for core-tapper.

“Recorded.” 

Metrak took the tapeclip out 
of his camera and slid it into the 
playback slot. “Send it, please.” 
“On line,” Tress stated. “Sent. 
The third aircar is arriving.” 

M IKKO FALKYNBERG and 
Morgan Oxbo paced the 
length of their cell as though they 



were a pair of military recruits 
practicing close-order drill, except 
for the body-slapping and rubbing 
of hands that went on as they 
marched back and forth. They both 
knew that to lie down would prob- 
ably mean the end. They might 
take a long time to die — but they’d 
never get up again. 

“We could chew our way out,” 
Morgan muttered. 

“Shut up,” Mikko said brusque- 
ly. “I’m thinking.” 

“About what?” 

“About death. Shut up.” 

Morgan shut up and frowned — 
not in irritation but in concentra- 
tion, trying to follow Mikko’s 
thoughts. Death? Mikko was not 
thinking about his own or 
Morgan’s death, that was certain. 
He might be worrying about how 
to avoid it but he wouldn’t be 
thinking about the fact itself. Then 
what death? Obviously that of their 
late cellmate — but what about it? 
If the man had actually died of 
poison rather than cold. But 
why would the “hairballs” want 
to kill him? Or didn’t they know 
their food was poisonous to hu- 
mans? 

Suddenly Mikko stopped and 
slapped his palms to his head with 
a jar that would have fractured 
both parietals of any ordinary 
man’s skull. 

“Of course!” he bellowed ring- 
ingly. “This damned cold has 
numbed my brain! I should have

RICHARD E. PECK 




W HILE sounds of the anniver- 
sary celebration wafted soft- 
ly from the dark valley below, 
George Harmon scrambled clum- 
sily over the crest of the ridge and 
cowered beside a huge boulder, 
gasping for breath. Scraps of shale 
bit into his knees and he cursed the 
darkness he himself had chosen for 
protection. Both moons lay low on 
the horizon of the summer sky, the 
nearer a mere crescent, the farther 
nearly full but dim in the distance. 



A perfect night for the test he had 
planned. Yet even as his eyes 
plumbed the darkness he sensed the 
circling shadow overhead. Shrink- 
ing against the lichen-crusted 
rocks, he waited. 

The shadow came again, blot- 
ting out a patch of brilliant stars 
which flickered rampant in their 
jet background — a milkwhite blur 
soared above him in lazy circles. 

Harmon took his bearings from 
the boulder and pointed himself 



down the far side of the ridge to- 
ward a cave mouth he had spotted 
during one of his solitary walks 
only days before, a sanctuary. If 
he could reach that cave unseen, 
his pursuer might — for one instant 
— lose track of him, might be- 
come separated, George would fi- 
nally sever the undefinable bond 
that united them. He felt little real 
hope but it was a chance. 

Seizing a large stone in one 
hand, he lurched to his feet and 
crashed through brush that raked 
his face, tore at his clothes with 
brittle fingers, scraping and clutch- 
ing at him. Heavy wings fluttered 
overhead but the sound only drove 
him faster. 

The cave mouth gaped its wel- 
come, a bit of the night sky 
planted darkling here among the 
rocks, and Harmon sprawled in- 
side, simultaneously hurling the 
stone in his hand down the talus 
slope ahead of him. Bounding 
racket clattered away through the 
rocks, a false trail to mislead his 
pursuer. Then he lay panting and 
waited. 

He swallowed nothing as the 
cotton in his mouth dissolved and 
his heaving chest slowed. Acrid 
sweat stung his eyes. All was quiet, 
except for the muted snatches of 
song drifting through the still night 
from the celebration he had left be- 
hind. That, too, was part of his 
plan: caught up in the excitement 
of the evening, the guardians might 
not notice his absence. A foolish 



hope, perhaps, but his only- one. 

After a long moment he risked a 
quick glance outside. 

His guardian perched some ten 
yards from him, preening and 
white, waiting with maddening 
faithfulness for Harmon to emerge 
from the cave. Anger swelled in 
him, drowned at once in the wave 
of peace that came unbidden to 
wash over and surround him. He 
tried to fight the calming aura that 
bathed his every thought. It was 
useless. There was no escaping. 

H ARMON rose once more to 
his feet and in resignation, 
turned back toward the valley. A 
draft of cooling night air fanned 
his neck as the guardian launched 
itself to swoop low over his bowed 
head, then wing its way aloft to re- 
sume a silent perch on the wind. 

Harmon cautiously circled the 
communal party on the way back 
to his pneumodome. The detour 
added thirty minutes to his trip 
home but he had no wish to meet 
any of the other colonists now, not 
with his guardian gleaming aber- 
rant white in the night sky above 
him like a contemning signpost. 
He knew that none of the others 
would admit how radically his 
guardian’s appearance had changed 
— he could not say whether they 
showed some mistaken sense of 
understanding or preferred blind- 
ness, but that didn’t matter. He 
knew his guardian — at least by 
sight. It had changed. 



54 



IF 




Once the guardian plummeted 
low across his path to snatch up an 
adder that had lain in deadly am- 
bush. Harmon pointedly ignored 
the service. He was long past the 
point of caring, certainly of thank- 
ing a creature whose every atten- 
tion he detested. 

His wife sat before their pneu- 
modome, waiting. “George? 
Where were you? Your clothes! 
What happened?” 

He stalked in past her. He knew, 
without bothering to glance behind 
him, that the guardian glided gent- 
ly down to settle on the dome spire 
and wait with loving concern. Dur- 
ing his first few months here he 
had several times tried to sneak 
away early in the pre-dawn dark- 
ness but the guardian was always 
alert and waiting. There was no es- 
cape. 

“George? I asked if you’re all 
right.” Marian followed him in- 
side. “I thought you might be sick 
when you left the party early.” 

He ignored her and devoted 
himself to the ritual of checking 
the compressor that kept their 
home erect. It was only through 
minor, habitual tasks like these 
that he was able to ignore her ir- 
ritating solicitude. 

“Well? Are you?” 

“Who’s ever sick here?” he de- 
manded. “And if you give me any 
of that ‘praise guardians’ I swear 
I’ll walk out again.” He flopped 
angrily into one of the two clumsy 
wooden chairs which, with a small 



table and inflated mattress, com- 
prised the furniture in their tempo- 
rary quarters. The steady thrum of 
the compressor drowned out the 
night noises outside and soothed 
him in spite of himself. 

“You should have stayed. After 
the dancing we voted to rename the 
colony. Eden. Isn’t that beautiful? 
John Martin thought of it.” 

“Eden,” George snorted. “I 
could have guessed. Leave it to our 
good Captain Martin to come up 
with that kind of maudlin mind- 
lessness.” 

Marian merely smiled and 
reached back to stroke the feath- 
ered head of her guardian, perched 
black and docile on the back of her 
chair. “Pretty bird,” she mur- 
mured. “Poor George isn’t him- 
self tonight.” 

“Damn it! Don’t excuse me to 
one of them. And haven’t I told 
you to leave that thing outside?” 

“Sorry, dear.” She nodded and 
her guardian fluttered softly 
through the susurring air current 
at the door and out into the night. 
“But he’s so small. He’s not really 
in the way.” 

“That’s just like you, throwing 
its size up to me. You wander 
around with a crow following you 
while I’m stuck with that reeking 
albino vulture out there. But I sup- 
pose you didn’t notice the color 
it’s turning.” 

“It’s really prettier than the oth- 
ers, don’t you think?” 

“But why do / get it?” 



THE GUARDIANS 



55 




“Guardians assign themselves,” 
Marian recited. 

The phrase carried the connota- 
tion of a catechism. 

George grunted his irritation 
and turned away to ignore what he 
could not refute. That fact that no 
one chose his guardian but was in- 
stead chosen had long since be- 
come apparent. Perhaps that was 
what irritated him most, his in- 
ability to change what everyone 
else in the colony had accepted as 
some sort of foreordained natural 
fact — mere hours after their ship 
had landed each colonist had found 
himself the object of special atten- 
tion lavished on him by a guardian, 
not chosen but acquired. 

O NE year ago to the day. One 
year ago they had thundered 
to a turf-searing landing in the 
broad valley stretching away to the 
south from the huge clearing that 
now contained the pneumodome 
village and the rich tilled fields 
which fed the colony. Advance 
scouting reports had promised 
them a potential paradise. Rotat- 
ing on an axis parallel to that of 
its sun, their new world underwent 
only mild seasonal changes here in 
the temperate belt. Except for a 
twenty-eight-hour day and a four- 
hundred-day year, the colonists’ 
new home seemed an improved 
replica of the overpopulated, un- 
derfed, war-ridden Earth they had 
all so eagerly left behind. 

How far behind, none of them 



could say. The psychologists all 
thought it best if they cut the cord 
completely and started fresh here. 
Some day their developing tech- 
nology would let them reestablish 
contact with other men, wherever 
their kin would be by then. For 
now, for the colonists, Eden was 
meant to be all there was. 

The trip outbound from Earth 
had passed between sleeping and 
waking — long years in suspended 
animation. During that time the 
starvation and skirmishing war- 
fare on Earth had increased un- 
known to the colonists, who awoke 
only when the ship’s preset equip- 
ment sensed “destination.” They 
awoke to new hope, to the sight of 
a green luxuriant world waiting to 
welcome them. Even George Har- 
mon had felt, for a brief moment, 
not his usual cynicism but a twinge 
of pleasure. It soon passed. Cap- 
tain Martin took command and 
restored Harmon’s sense of irrita- 
tion with his place in the new 
scheme. 

- “Families to my left, single men 
over here,” Martin ordered. “I 
want sentries posted till we can in- 
flate the first dormitory and estab- 
lish security. Then we’ll worry 
about making contact with those 
birds we’ve been hearing about.” 

A snicker rippled through the 
nervous crowd. Of the facts known 
to the colonists about their new 
home, one stood out as the most 
unlikely: in spite of the planet’s 
hospitable environment, no com- 



56 



IF 




plex organism had developed suf- 
ficiently to dominate the animal 
life present. Only a single species 
of birds which traveled in large 
flocks showed any tendency to- 
ward social organization — but not 
real intelligence — a sort of silent, 
empathetic bond. Scouting reports 
described the birds as small, appar- 
ently harmless; the roboprobe 
scoutships had brought back to 
Earth hours of film, carefully re- 
corded data — everything, in fact, 
except the intangibles which only a 
human survey crew might have no- 
ticed. But human crews were un- 
thinkable aboard scoutships, given 
the duration of the journey each 
covered and the massive G-loads 
which would reduce a frail orga- 
nism to jelly but troubled the 
automated equipment not at all. 
No, the probes had brought back 
enough data, even about the birds. 

And so, during their indoctrina- 
tion at Colony Central in Utah- 
state, the potential colonists had of 
course joked with one another 
about the hosts who awaited them 
in their new home. For the entire 
two months of their training, they 
had treated one another to puns 
about “birds of a feather,” about 
their being the “early birds” bound 
to get the worm, and whatever oth- 
er strained cleverness occurred to 
people bone-tired from days of 
endless psychological screening, 
adaptability tests and lectures on 
the problems of founding an agrar- 
ian society. 



Harmon had avoided the horse- 
play — birdplay, Marian said once, 
only to cringe under the withering 
look her husband had thrown her. 
He had concentrated instead on 
satisfying the examiners, all of 
whom had seemed determined to 
dissuade him from emigrating, 
even though his number had come 
up in the monthly New Life Lot- 
tery. Besides the pap they kept 
muttering about his potential in- 
stability, there was the question of 
his occupation. In theory a legis- 
lator like Harmon, a man accus- 
tomed to guiding an organized so- 
ciety, should be valuable in any 
new colony; in practice farmers 
and laborers somehow proved 
more effective and reliable. But 
George had managed to pass all 
their tests, more often than not 
masking his true feelings to answer 
heir childishly transparent ques- 
tions as he knew they expected of a 
“good risk.” That much he could 
do — anything to escape the terrors 
of a poisoned atmosphere, of in- 
secticide-laden milk and seawater, 
of the burgeoning sterility that 
threatened all who remained on the 
dying Earth. 

So he and Marian had joined the 
other lucky ones, the groups of 
three hundred people who fled 
Earth each month to sink a new 
foothold for man in some distant 
corner of the expanding universe. 

T HEY had stood with the oth- 
ers while John Martin, elected

captain before their liftoff from 
Earth, apportioned land and set 
them to work in teams to canni- 
balize the ship itself for its usable 
equipment. With the others in the 
sweating crowd they cheered when 
the first pneumodome sagged and 
blossomed erect. And with the oth- 
ers they tensed at the sight of hun- 
dreds of birds boiling over the ho- 
rizon to approach and circle the 
band of wary colonists. 

But at first nothing happened. 

The birds merely circled, until 
the colonists separated, each cou- 
ple or work team to go its own 
way. Then a strange symbiosis de- 
veloped between them and the birds 
— “guardians” they were soon 
called. Each colonist found him- 
self possessing, or being possessed 
by, one of the delicate, aromatic 
gray doves. Not that any formal 
bond was ever made. Nor was 
communication between them pos- 
sible. But a relationship developed 
nevertheless. A single bird fol- 
lowed each man and each woman 
night and day, always in sight. 

A sentry walking the perimeter 
of the camp first described the re- 
lationship. “1 was taking a short- 
cut through the brush over there 
and accidentally kicked a hornet’s 
nest. Anyway, they looked like 
N what I’d call hornets. They came 
buzzing out fit to eat me alive. 
This bird I’d been seeing behind me 
all along comes swooping down 
and gobbles them up so fast I al- 
most couldn’t see him work. Not 



one of them got close enough to 
sting me. First thing you know, the 
bird’s back, flying in circles over 
my head. There he is. There.” 

His report drew echoes from the 
others in the communal assembly, 
tales of unexpected aid. The birds, 
some said, had saved them from 
snakes writhing through the under- 
brush. Or the birds had chattered 
warnings to those few who had 
thought to eat what appeared to be 
an apple, a fruit later proven to be 
deadly poison. Though no one un- 
derstood how it worked, everyone 
was certain it did — the birds knew 
what threatened man and they pro- 
tected him. 

“Asking nothing in return,” 
Martin had told them. “As far as 
we know, theirs is honest altruism. 
You’ve noticed that it’s always the 
same bird trailing you, right?” 

The crowd nodded assent. 

“All I can say is, they’re some 
kind of guardians.” 

“Nonsense!” Harmon shouted. 
“They must get something out of 
it. It’s not right otherwise. In a 
symbiosis both partners benefit.” 
“Then call it parasitism, if you 
want, with us the parasites,” Mar- 
tin said. 

“I still say it’s suspicious.” 

But the others had booed 
George down. 

Within a week the relationship 
had become an accepted part of 
their new life. No one would suffer 
the least slight uttered about the 
guardians. One young boy found 



58 



IF 




himself censured for resurrecting a 
meaningless but apparently clever 
greeting he had once heard back 
on Earth: “How’s your bird?” His 
father slapped him— or began to. 
But he hesitated and the blow 
didn’t land. 

Nevertheless, the boy felt repri- 
manded. 

And John Martin’s designation 
stuck. “Guardians” the birds be- 
came. 

44^eorge?” Marian nudged him 
VJ gently. “What’s wrong?” 

He rolled to face her. “You talk 
with the others more than I do. 
Did anyone ever escape his guard- 
ian? Or see one die? And the dogs 
—they whine any time a guardian 
gets near. Or they used to.” 

“Why? They’re all—” 

“Skip it. Let it go. I should have 
known better than to ask you. Of 
course you’re content. And the 
others, not a brain in their heads. 
Your friend Martin’s as stupid as 
those sheep he coddles all day. But 
someone must recognize how we 
depend on them. It’s not right. It’s 
— it’s inhuman.” 

“We’ve been all through this, 
George, a hundred times. I 
thought John Martin had settled it. 
The crops prosper, our flocks in- 
crease, there hasn’t been a quarrel 
— much less a fight — in the whole 
year we’ve been here. If the guard- 
ians do any more than we see, it’s 
only to help. I admit I won’t go as 
far as the people who almost wor- 



ship them, but I can’t see anything 
wrong.” 

“I’ll tell you what’s wrong. 
They’re getting something from 
us. They must be. Did you ever 
know anyone to do all the things 
they do and not expect to get paid? 
On Earth we — ” 

Marian smiled. “We’re not on 
earth, dear,” 

“So? At least there a man’s 
worth was recognized. Here we’re 
all dirt-grubbing farmers, all ex- 
cept the high muckey-muck Mar- 
tin. Our leader. He even stinks like 
his sheep.” 

“Please. Try to sleep. I’m sure 
you’re worried about nothing.” 
She kissed his cheek and turned 
away. 

Patronizing— just like Martin . 
Neither of them sense enough to 
see the obvious . 

But he had seen. The feathered 
parasite that followed his every 
step had changed radically. In the 
beginning they were all the same — 
mourning doves, he might have 
called them on Earth, gray and 
delicate, small-boned, graceful, a 
delight to watch circling in the sun- 
light as the men worked the fields 
or urged their flocks upslope to 
the high pasture lands. They 
seemed to exude an undefinable 
aroma — vaguely pleasant, like 
freshly laundered linen. 

But then changes began to ap- 
pear in the birds. Marian’s guard- 
ian, for instance, was smaller now. 
Harmon was sure of it. Smaller 



THE GUARDIANS

and darker, nearly black, as if 
some evil had worked its transfor- 
mation on the bird. Harmon’s own 
had grown gigantic, almost as 
large as an eagle and was turning 
whiter by the day. He swore he had 
seen it pass through shades of 
lighter and lighter gray: leaden, 
ashen, pearl. Only a few days ear- 
lier he had glanced up to see it 
haunting him as he walked home 
from the fields. On impulse he had 
hurled his hoe at the creature, and 
it flashed brilliant white in the twi- 
light. Then the brilliance faded. As 
a single occurrence, the sight 
might have been blamed on some 
trick of the fading sunlight, but 
Harmon refused to accept that no- 
tion. He had seen the same phe- 
nomenon too often. The creature 
was whiter: now cream; then milk. 
He knew; everyone must have seen 
it. 

He had even swallowed his dis- 
like for Martin long enough to ask 
whether anyone had made contact 
with the guardians, had discovered 
some way of communicating with 
them. So many questions unan- 
swered. Why did they follow the 
colonists? and why particular ones? 
Could a man trade guardians with 
someone else? But Martin — busy 
in preparation for the anniversary 
celebration — had ignored him. And 
the others, including those few who 
seemed to fear the guardians, how- 
ever slightly, refused to under- 
stand his questions; they even de- 
nied the calming scent that seemed 



to follow the guardians every- 
where. 

It was then that Harmon had de- 
cided that he would escape his 
guardian, kill it if necessary. Settle 
things once and for all, find out 
what all this meant. 

Tonight, with the community 
gathered to celebrate a year of 
peace and plenty, he had gone off 
alone to make his final test. When 
that proved fruitless — he sucked a 
scrape on his forearm and savored 
the memory of the pain he had felt 
hurtling through the brush in his 
futile attempt to escape — when 
that proved fruitless, he had known 
what he must do. He smiled his 
hatred toward the dark dome over- 
head and toward the bird he knew 
sat waiting. He would kill his 
guardian but in such a way that no 
one else would understand his in- 
tention — make the act appear 
spontaneous, perhaps accidental. 

Harmon fell asleep smiling. 

F OR the next few days he only 
watched. The crops had been 
harvested, a second planting was 
already underway. While the work 
teams sweated and labored at their 
appointed tasks, Harmon ques- 
tioned those around him. He soon 
discovered a pattern: the guardians 
maintained their distance, usually 
separated a full twenty to thirty 
yards from the host to which each 
had attached itself, unless mo- 
tioned nearer by the man himself. 
But in moments of stress, when 



60 



IF 




tempers flared or danger threat- 
ened, they dove nearer. And they 
brought with them peace — an in- 
tangible aura of well-being — al- 
most as though each guardian 
somehow broadcast placidity and 
emotional calm. The sentimental- 
ists among Harmon’s coworkers 
called it love, to his disgust. 

To test his newly formed theo- 
ry, George tried provoking argu- 
ments. He jostled men working 
their way down the bean rows; he 
tripped a boy intentionally. Tem- 
pers flared, but nothing more ever 
came of it. In every case even a 
hint of anger or distrust drew the 
guardians nearer rnd the mood 
passed. Simultaneously the guard- 
ians paled, became for a brief mo- 
ment lighter in color than they had 
been. 

It was clear. The birds flour- 
ished on tension, on hate and fear 
and anger, on the swelling emo- 
tions alien to this world and un- 
known before man’s arrival. Per- 
haps, Harmon theorized, a man’s 
very body chemistry, imbalanced 
however slightly in moments of 
stress, attracted the hypersensitive 
guardians. As an addict might pay 
for narcotics, the birds returned a 
sense of peace and well-being for 
the emotions they absorbed. 

That possibility even accounted 
for the lack of illness among the 
colonists, he decided. Injuries were 
of course rare, with guardians al- 
ways present to warn of impending 
danger. But illness was equally 



rare. In some unexplained way the 
guardians ministered to their hosts, 
absorbing or drawing off flashes of 
anger or unpleasant physical sensa- 
tions. Though many colonists 
feared their guardians, everyone 
seemed content, at peace with him- 
self and his neighbors. Everyone 
but George Harmon, whose fear 
of the birds had become loathing. 
He hated his guardian more by the 
moment. It grew and paled notice- 
ably, bathing George in the fra- 
grant warmth of affection that on- 
ly increased his hatred. 

“Why can’t you accept things?” 
Marian pleaded. “Sometimes I 
think you’re sorry we came to 
Eden. We’re all so happy. John 
says that if — ” 

“Martin again!” George 
slammed his wooden cup against 
the wall and stared in frustration 
as it bounced to the floor undam- 
aged. He felt the veins throbbing 
in his forehead and reached for 
something to break or tear, but 
there was nothing. “If you men- 
tion him to me once — ” He 
stopped at the sound of heavy 
Wings at the curtain of his dome. 

And then he knew. He smirked. 
The strongest surge of emotion he 
had felt in weeks had drawn the 
creature toward him, like a victim 
to a baited trap. 

Martin was that bait. 

He fought the pacific calm that 
filled the pneumodome, and 
plotted his next move. It would all 
be so simple. 



THE GUARDIANS 



61 




I N THE morning he joined the 
procession moving toward the 
beanfield they were planting. He 
followed the planting team down 
the rows, covering each newly 
seeded hill with moist soil with his 
hoe blade. While he worked, he 
waited. 

Shadows drifted along the tilled 
rows. The guardians circling over- 
head. Banter passed among the 
men, gossip about a new baby born 
the day before and already under 
the protection of a guardian. 

And then Harmon’s moment ar- 
rived. John Martin strode toward 
the workers. 

“Martin! I want to see you!’’ 
A few of the others looked cu- 
rious at his tone but returned to 
their labors. Only the guardians 
overhead showed agitation. 

“What is it, George?’’ 
Harmon savored the aroma 
Martin carried, the ripe scent of 
his flocks. He let a thought blos- 
som full and rich in his mind: Kill 
him! Kill him! The hate swelled 
and burned with a fiery delight. He 
watched Martin’s gray guardian 
swoop low in chittering protest and 
dash itself against Martin’s chest; 
but Martin only paused in bewil- 
derment. 

Harmon raised his hoe and 
lunged at Martin. Fluttering wings 
grazed his head as his own screech- 
ing guardian circled lower. The 
trap sprung, George whirled. His 
hoe flashed through the sunlight to 
chop at the mass of snowy feath- 



ers. The hoe swung and struck in 
frantic, staggered rhythm. A mist 
of gas and splattering gray drop- 
lets spewed from the bird’s rup- 
tured breast to shower over Har- 
mon. He sagged suddenly in 
rapture and reached up out- 
stretched arms to the white feath- 
ers drifting gently down through 
the cloud that permeated his swell- 
ing flesh. Then he knew , became 
one with, the guardian’s fetid in- 
tensity — his lungs strained to 
bursting as he sucked in under- 
standing from the sunlit, rainbow- 
streaked air. 

Plaintive gull cries filled the air. 
The guardians dove to surround 
the men who stood rooted in fear 
at the sight of Harmon writhing on 
the ground in an agony of joy, 
bloating and swelling like a mad- 
dened cancer. A musky glow of 
peace and contentment laved over 
the watchers, tears filling their 
eyes to blind them. 

When they saw once more, they 
stared bewildered at the shattered 
guardian, the burden of hate now 
lifted from its slender frame and 
returned to its source — that source 
a mass of corruption melting to 
fuse with the earth. 

Sadly they covered the foulness 
at their feet and returned to work. 

Soon no one in Eden remem- 
bered George Harmon, though on 
still summer evenings the guard- 
ians often swoop low over a single 
spot of sterility lying barren in that 
fertile soil. •

IF 





S CIENCE fiction is unique in 
that it is essentially a literature 
of ideas. With only a few excep- 
tions the general stream of fiction 
has been forced to depend on the 
emotional involvement of essen- 
tially familiar people and their in- 
teractions in basically familiar sit- 
uations. That makes the use of any 
really different new idea so hard to 
weave in convincingly that few 
writers can succeed. On the other 
hand, science fiction offers a uni- 
verse-wide range of possibilities. 
We can tell the story of a woman 
who marries a complete alien or a 
man who sees the end of the uni- 
verse. 

One of the results of this differ- 
ence is that in science fiction the 
shorter length is often better than 
the full novel. In general fiction, 
length is needed to develop the 
complexity of interactions which 



must substitute for freshness of 
concept. In our field, simplicity 
can be a virtue, letting the basic 
idea stand forth clear and unclut- 
tered. Nowadays, due partly to the 
market, some of these get padded 
out into spurious novels, of 
course; but over the decades some 
of the most memorable examples 
of science fiction have been found 
in stories of less than fifteen thou- 
sand words. 

Maybe this is why the anthology 
has been so important a form of 
book in this field, unlike in most 
others. In general fiction a man 
who has written a whole body of 
excellent short work can hope to 
see his efforts kept in print 
through collections. But the writer 
who depends on a few great stories 
— even classics of their kind — is 
too often doomed to oblivion, ex- 
cept in science fiction. 



READING ROOM 



63 




In a sense, the story of the ac- 
ceptance of science fiction as a 
publishable form began with the 
anthology. Back in 1946, when 
only a few fan publishers were try- 
ing to bring out science fiction, 
Random House issued Adventures 
in Time and Space , edited by Ray- 
mond J. Healy and J. Francis Mc- 
Comas. It was a huge book, con- 
taining 997 pages of fiction, total- 
ing almost half a million words. 
There were 35 stories, culled from 
the virgin territory of all the 
science-fiction magazine work 
published to that date. And it sold, 
as I remember, for $2.95! 

Whenever librarians ask me to 
submit a list of science-fiction 
books they should stock, this an- 
cient anthology heads the list. Un- 
til very recently, at least, it was 
still available in the Modern Li- 
brary edition (under a different 
title — Famous Science Fiction , I 
believe — and less a couple of stor- 
ies that don’t matter that much). 
It’s a book that should still be on 
the shelves of every genuine fan of 
the field; if you don’t have it, get 
it — new or secondhand, it’s still 
a great bargain. 

During the same year another 
anthology appeared — this edited 
by Groff Conklin and put out by 
Crown Publishers: The Best of 
Science Fiction. It wasn’t quite 
the huge bargain the first was and 
Groff had sometimes been unable 
to get the stories he wanted be- 
cause they were already purchased 



for the earlier book. But its suc- 
cess in the market and in sales to 
libraries also helped to convince 
publishers that there was money 
to be made in this crazy field. 

Since then there have been 
hordes of anthologies. Some, like 
Groff Conklin’s excellent later 
ones, were gathered with love and 
by means of diligent reading of 
the magazines. Some were put to- 
gether shoddily by mining earlier 
anthologies. A few have been sim- 
ply excuses to get stories by a 
clique into print. And there have 
been numerous anthologies of 
original stories, written especially 
for the anthologist. In the case of 
the Star series by Frederik Pohl, 
this worked out rather well. But 
in general, it seems to be a poor 
practice; writers can’t turn out su- 
perb stories on order and deadlines 
force an editor to fill a volume 
with fiction no better — and some- 
times worse — than can be found 
in any issue of a magazine, despite 
the name writers and a much high- 
er price. 

About the time the anthology 
market seemed to be exhausted for 
anything but annual “Bests,” the 
collecting of stories around a 
theme became the chief sales gim- 
mick. Now the trick was not so 
much to get the best stories but to 
find the ones that could be related 
to some single subject that would 
afford a catchy or controversial 
title for the book. Some of these 
were fairly good but most either 



64 



IF 




reshuffled old familiars or aban- 
doned taste to fill the book. 

Other anthologists added all 
kinds of extraneous matter to pad 
out the volumes. Serious — and 
rather dull — articles were stuck in 
between stories to show how wise 
or clever they were in sticking to 
science, or some such, rather than 
letting the stories stand on their 
own merits. In a few cases, there 
has been so much editorial materi- 
al in explanations and blurbs and 
“selling” that it’s hard to evaluate 
the fiction, because the editor’s 
evaluation is shoved down our 
throats at every break. It is as if a 
magazine had a page of filler or 
editorial “Hoo-boy Wow Gosh” 
for every page of fiction! 

There have been some excellent 
volumes I’m happy to have in my 
collection, but it has been a long 
time since the field has seen an 
anthology capable of standing tall 
in the shadow of the classic Ad- 
ventures . For nearly a quarter of 
a century, that book has been my 
unfailing choice whenever I wanted 
to convert some friend to science 
fiction. 

N OW, at last, it has a worthy 
successor. Science Fiction Hall 
of Fame , edited by Robert Silver- 
berg (Doubleday, $7.95), is a defin- 
itive anthology of the shorter 
works of science fiction since the 
magazines began. It even lives up 
to its subtitle: The Greatest 

Science Fiction Stories of All 



Times! And without any real re- 
servations, I’m forced to give it a 
rave review on its merits. 

Of course, times have changed 
and no such bargain as the earlier 
volume is possible today. Now it 
costs $7.95 to get a quarter mil- 
lion words — half of what $2.95 
would buy in 1946! But it’s still a 
great bargain in the current mar- 
ket when a novel of 60,000 words 
usually sells for $4.95 and up. 
When you consider the quality of 
the words there’s no comparison 
in value. 

In a brief foreword, Silverberg 
gives the background and intent. 
(Mercifully, there’s no other edi- 
torial intrusion. For your money, 
you get solid worth in stories, 
packed tight in all the numbered 
pages.) All the professional writers 
who belonged to the Science Fic- 
tion Writers of America were 
asked to nominate and then vote 
on their favorite stories before 
1965. Silverberg did the work of 
collating their responses and the 
present book represents his efforts 
at putting together the results of 
the summed judgment of the pro- 
fessionals in the field. He did his 
work brilliantly and I cannot but 
agree with the few cases where he 
admitted to the need of some per- 
sonal weighing of the results. Any- 
how, it’s all explained in the fore- 
word, with the exact listing of the 
top fifteen of the twenty-six stories 
in order of votes. 

These are supposedly the stories

that would have won the Nebula 
awards given by the SFWA for 
shorter fiction, had the Nebulas 
existed when they appeared. 

Actually they’re a lot better 
in my opinion than some of the 
stories that have won— and repre- 
sent a far more balanced judg- 
ment. Apparently time and dis- 
tance have removed the personal 
angles that must so often motivate 
the voting for current awards, and 
the result is a list of some genuine 
classics. 

Also, twenty-five years have 
passed since Healy and McComas 
made their personal selections, 
and we’ve had time to weed and 
compare, as well as many more 
stories from which to select. Loyal 
as I am to the old book, I have to 
admit that some of the work there 
might better be omitted for other 
material today. 

Even the arrangement of stor- 
ies in the Silverberg anthology is a 
happy one. The order is strictly by 
date, with the first appearing in 
1934 and the last in 1963. This 
helps to put each story in perspec- 
tive as it is read and it also makes 
the book a very convenient source 
of the history of our development. 

The oldest story is Stanley 
Weinbaum’s Martian Odyssey — 
perhaps the most revolutionary 
story ever written. There are 
quaint touches which the early 
date helps to explain; some of it 
wouldn’t be written that way to- 
day. But how the story stands up 
in its totality! The next story is 

66 



John Campbell’s Twilight , which 
was good enough on first reading 
to inspire my first fan letter to a 
magazine — and still good enough 
to make me wish more writers 
who try setting mood had the skill 
Campbell showed back in 1934. 
And because of the date (1938), 1 
manage to stagger in third with 
Helen O'Loy. Curious, by hap- 
penstance I was third on the con- 
tents page in the old anthology, I 
see. Ah well, Silverberg couldn’t 
be wholly original! That would 
violate tradition, obviously. 

It’s hard to pick the best Hein- 
lein Future History novelette, but 
The Roads Must Roll still rolls. 
Then we have two stories which 
the authors have come to hate be- 
cause readers keep coming up to 
them and demanding more like 
them. I have to agree with the ma- 
jority about Theodore Sturgeon’s 
Microcosmic God — it’s my favor- 
ite from all his science fiction. On 
the other hand, I agree with Isaac 
Asimov that he has written better 
stories than Nightfall— but not 
much better and none so universal- 
ly remembered. 

A.E. van Vogt is represented by 
The Weapon Shop , to my surprise; 
I’d have guessed his very first story 
was more popular. Yet I agree 
with the majority here; it’s a story 
so good that he didn’t have to be 
confusing in it. It has some of his 
best writing and, in my opinion, 
all of his best characterization. 
The first ten years is completed 

IF 




with Mimsy Were the Borogoves , 
by Lewis Padgett (Kuttner and/or 
Moore). This was something of a 
key story also, since there were a 
number of imitations in handling 
and intent to follow that. 

It was a great decade and the 
stories assembled here to record it 
are stories every real reader of 
science fiction has to know. It was 
a decade that began with the slow 
realization that aliens were essen- 
tially human — and ended with the 
knowledge that humans are es- 
sentially alien. 

The next decade from 1944 to 
1953 seems to be more a period of 
consolidation, beginning with Clif- 
ford Simak’s Huddling Place and 
ending with Surface Tension by 
James Blish and The Nine Billion 
Names of God by Arthur Clarke. 
In between came the one great in- 
novation of the decade, I suspect — 
Cordwainer Smith’s Scanners Live 
in Vain , which was a legend with- 
in a year because of its publication 
in a less-known magazine and the 
amazing reputation it achieved in 
spite of that fact. There are still 
plenty of writers consciously or 
otherwise imitating that story. 

I T IS in this section that I find 
my own total agreement with 
the selection beginning to disap- 
pear. There are no stories here I 
can say flatly do not belong, with 
one possible exception; and that 
one is doubtful only because tha- 
lidomide came along many years 

READING ROOM 



later to take some of the kick out 
of the situation. Still, I suppose 
the effect remains on those who 
read it when it was a new and out- 
standing idea. Two other stories 
here strike me as below the qual- 
ity I associate with classics — one 
because I seem to be prejudiced 
against the writer’s work gener- 
ally, perhaps; and the other be- 
cause I never felt his best work 
was done in this field. But since 
my convictions here aren’t all that 
strong. I’ll leave it as a pleasant 
guessing game as to those I mean. 
Fill in with your own prejudices, 
if you like. 

I suspect that during the ten 
years of this middle period writers 
were improving their techniques 
but still sticking to the tried-and- 
true for ideas. If so, it would ac- 
count for the somewhat lower 
standard of impact here, since the 
ideas generally would have a lower 
luster than some earlier ones, 
even though the early handling 
lacked some of the later polish. 
People tend to remember ideas 
more than style or treatment, 
praise be! 

The last decade, ending in 1963, 
is significantly different in attitude. 
There is no longer the assurance 
of greatness that once existed in 
our dreams of the future. (Even 
Twilight showed that assurance; 
true, the end was possibly failure, 
but the middle period for millions 
of years . !) Jerome Bixby’s It’s 
a Good Life is negatively implied 

67 




in its title, and Tom Godwin’s 
Cold Equations is a story of harsh 
inevitability, as logical and as bit- 
terly unsentimental as its title in- 
dicates. And we wind up the book 
with the bitter-sweet of Roger Ze- 
lazny’s A Rose for Ecclesiastes , 
which proved that new talent could 
be great talent. 

I’ve obviously skipped some 
stories and many of those were 
ones that unquestionably had to 
be included and which I consider 
to be truly classics. I’m not trying 
to give the table of contents, but 
rather to get some meaning out of 
the book. And I hope others will 
draw their own conclusions, since 
the logical arrangement here begs 
for analysis on the part of the 
reader. 

In sum, if I were asked for one 
science-fiction book to go into a 
time-capsule today, or for one 
book to represent us on the gener- 
al shelves of our libraries, this is 
the book I would have to pick. 
Anyone who can put this book 
down with less than great satisfac- 
tion obviously has no taste at all 
for science fiction. 

This is not a perfect book, how- 
ever. Doubleday has managed as 
usual to come up with a dust wrap- 
per that makes the title hard to 
read without study and reminds 
me of a rather bad circus poster 
with the colors faded enough to 
show that the circus has already 
left town. Then they stick their list 
of authors under a caption that 



says: Chosen by the Members of 
the Science Fiction Writers of 
America. This makes it seem that 
those names represent the SFWA 
— as could hardly be true of Wein- 
baum, for instance — and as if the 
SFWA had a total of 27 mem- 
bers. Ah well. Maybe somebody at 
Doubleday is spending more time 
making book than making books. 
Fortunately, this is the only ma- 
jor gripe I have and I’ve already 
macerated the horror of that dust 
jacket and flushed it down the 
drain. 

This is listed as “Volume One,” 
incidentally. (I think that is also 
a horrible thing to put on a dust- 
jacket, since some may decide to 
wait for the others or decide not 
to buy something incomplete. 
Don’t you like to sell books, Dou- 
bleday?) Thereby hangs a plan. 

The expectation is that similar 
volumes representing the longer 
stories — more than 15,000 words 
but less than novel-length — and 
finally the novels will be issued, 
using the same method of select- 
ing. I’m going to look forward to 
the book of novelettes, since sev- 
eral of the stories I consider great- 
est were left out of this volume be- 
cause of length. And I’m going to 
worry a good bit about that vol- 
ume of novels. With no more than 
five novels to fill such a book, it’s 
going to be close to impossible to 
choose a representative collection 
of the greatest. 

When the whole project is com-

pleted, however, the value of the 
three volumes may be far greater 
than could be found in any single 
book. Then we’ll have a true li- 
brary in three books — and there 
will therefore be no excuse for 



even the smallest public library 
not carrying enough science fiction 
to offer a fine example to readers.

I 

S ECOND SECRETARY RE- 
TIEF of the Terran Embassy 
emerged from his hotel into a 
bunting-draped street crowded with 
locals: bustling, furry folk with up- 
raised, bushy tails, like oversized 
chipmunks, ranging in height from 
a foot to a yard. A party of plac- 



KEITH LAUMER 

ard-carrying marchers, emerging 
from a side street, jostled their way 
through the press, briskly ripping 
down political posters attached to 
shop walls and replacing them with 
posters of their own. Their move 
was immediately countered by a 
group of leaflet distributors who 
set about applying mustaches, 
beards and crossed eyes to the new 



71 





placards. The passersby joined in 
cheerfully, some blacking out teeth 
and adding warts to the tips of but- 
ton noses, others grabbing the 
brushes from the defacers and ap- 
plying them to their former own- 
ers’ faces. Fists flew; the clamor 
rose. 

Retief felt a tug at his knee; a 
small Oberonian dressed in blue 
breeches and a spotted white apron 
looked up at him from wide, wor- 
ried eyes. 

“Prithee, fair sir,” the small 
creature piped in a shrill voice, 
“come quick, ere all is lost!” 

“What’s the matter?” Retief in- 
quired, noting the flour smudge on 
the Oberonian’s cheek and the dab 
of pink icing on the tip of his nose. 
“Are the cookies burning?” 

“E’en worse than that, milord — 
’tis the Tsuggs! The great brutes 
would dismantle the shop entire! 
But follow and observe!” The 
Oberonian whirled and darted 
away. 

Retief followed along the steep- 
ly sloping cobbled alley between 
close-pressing houses, his head lev- 
el with the second-story balconies. 
Through open windows he caught 
glimpses of doll’s-houselike interi- 
ors, complete with toy tables and 
chairs and postage-stamp-sized TV 
screens. The bright-eyed inhabi- 
tants clustered at their railings, 
twittering like sparrows as he 
passed. He picked his way with 
care among the pedestrians crowd- 
ing the way: twelve-inch Ploots and 



eighteen-inch Grimbles in purple 
and red leathers, two-foot Choobs 
in fringed caps and aprons, lordly 
three-foot-six-inch Blufs, elegant 
in ruffles and curled pink wigs. 
Ahead, he heard shrill cries, a tin- 
kle of breaking glass, a dull thump. 
Rounding a sharp turn, he came 
on the scene of action. 

Before a shop with a sign bear- 
ing a crude painting of a salami, a 
crowd had gathered, ringing in a 
group of half a dozen giant Ober- 
onians of a type new to Retief: 
swaggering dandies in soiled silks, 
with cruelly cropped tails, scimi- 
tars slung at their waists — if crea- 
tures of the approximate shape of 
ten-pins can be said to have waists. 
One of the party held the bridles of 
their mounts — scaled, spike-maned 
brutes resembling gaily painted 
rhinoceroses, but for their promi- 
nent canines, and long, muscular 
legs. Two more were busy with 
crowbars, levering at the lintel over 
the shop doorway. Another pair 
were briskly attacking the adjacent 
wall with sledge-hammers. The 
sixth, distinguished by a scarlet 
sash with a pistol thrust through 
it, stood with folded arms, smiling 
a sharp-toothed smile at the in- 
dignant mob. 

“ ’Tis the pastry and ale shop of 
Binkster Druzz, my grand uncle 
twice removed!” RetieFs diminu- 
tive guide shrilled. “A little light- 
hearted destruction in the course 
of making one’s political views 
clear is all very well — but these

IF 




pirates would reduce us to penury! 
Gramercy, milord, canst not im- 
pede the brutes?” He swarmed 
ahead, clearing a path through the 
onlookers. The red-sashed one, no- 
ticing Retiefs approach unfolded 
his arms, letting one hand linger 
near the butt of the pistol — a Gro- 
aci copy of a two-hundred-year-old 
Concordiat sliver-gun, * Retief 
noted. 

“Close enough, off-worlder,” 
the Tsugg said in a somewhat 
squeaky baritone. “What would 
ye here? Ye’r hutch lieth in the 
next street yonder.” 

R ETIEF smiled gently at the 
bear-like Oberonian, who 
loomed over the crowd, his eyes al- 
most on a level with RetieFs own, 
his bulk far greater. “I want to 
buy a jelly doughnut,” the Terran 
said. “Your lads seem to be block- 
ing the doorway.” 

“Aroint thee, Terry; seek re- 
freshment elsewhere. Being some- 
what fatigued with campaigning, I 
plan to honor this low dive with 
my custom; my bullies must needs 
enlarge the door to comport with 
my noble dimensions.” 

“That won’t be convenient,” Re- 
tief said smoothly. “When I want a 
jelly doughnut I want it now.” He 
took a step toward the door; the 
pistol jumped at him. The other 
Tsuggs were gathering around, 
hefting crowbars. 

“Ah-ah,” Retief cautioned, rais- 
ing a finger — and at the same mo- 



ment swung his foot in a short arc 
that ended just under the gun-han- 
dler’s knee-joint. The victim 
emitted a sharp yap and leaned for- 
ward far enough for his jaw to in- 
tersect the course of Retiefs left 
fist. Retief palmed the gun deftly 
as the Tsugg staggered into the 
arms of his companions. 

“Aroint thee, lads,” the giant 
muttered reproachfully to his sup- 
porters, shaking his head dazedly. 
“We’ve been boon drinking chums 
these six Lesser Moons and this is 
the first time ye’ve give me any of 
the food stuff . .” 

“Spread out, lads,” one of the 
Tsuggs ordered his companions. 
“We’ll pound this knave into a thin 
paste.” 

“Better relax, gentlemen,” Re- 
tief suggested. “This gun is messy 
at short range.” 

“An’ I mistake me not,” one of 
the crowbar wielders said, eyeing 
Retief sourly, “ye’r one of the out- 
world bureaucrats, here to connive 
in the allocation of loot, now the 
Sticky-fingers have gone.” 

“Ambassador Clawhammer pre- 
fers to refer to his role as referee- 
ing the elections, nothing more,” 
Retief corrected. 

“Aye,” the Tsugg nodded, 
“that’s what I said. So how is it 
ye’re interfering with the free dem- 
ocratic process by coshing Dir 
Blash in the midst of exercising his 
voice in local affairs?” 

“We bureaucrats are a mild 
lot,” Retief clarified, “unless

someone gets between us and our 
jelly doughnuts.” 

Red-sash was weaving on his 
feet, shaking his head. “ ’Tis a 
scurvy trick,” he said blurrily, 
“sneaking a concealed anvil into a 
friendly little six-to-one crowbar 
affray.” 

“Let’s go,” one of the others 
said, “ere he produces a howitzer 
from his sleeve.” The banditi 
mounted their wild-eyed steeds 
amid much snorting and tossing of 
fanged heads. 

“But we’ll not forget ye’re vis- 
age, off-worlder,” another prom- 
ised. “I wot well we’ll meet again 
— and next time we’ll be none so 
lenient.” 

A hubbub of pleased chatter 
broke out among the lesser Ober- 
onians as the party passed from 
sight. 

“Milord has saved Great-uncle 
Binkster’s fried fat this day,” the 
small being who had enlisted Re- 
tieFs aid cried. The Terran leaned 
over, hands on knees, which put his 
face on a level only a foot or two 
above that of the little fellow. 

“Haven’t I seen you before?” he 
asked. 

“Certes, milord — until an hour 
since, I eked out a few coppers as 
third assistant pastry cook in the 
inn yonder, assigned to the cup- 
cake division, decorative icing 
branch.” He sighed. “My specialty 
was rosebuds — but no need to bur- 
den your grace with my plaint.” 

“You lost your job?” 



“Aye, that did I — but forsooth, 
’tis but a trifling circumstance, in 
light of what I o’erheard ere the 
hostler bade me hie me from the 
premises forthwith!” 

“Let’s see, your name is — ” 

“Prinkle, milord. Ipstitch Prin- 
kle IX, at your service.” The Twil- 
pritt turned as a slightly plumper, 
grayer version of himself bustled 
up, bobbing his head and twitching 
his ears in a manner expressive of 
effusive gratitude. “And this, Mi- 
lord, is Uncle Binkster, in the 
flesh.” 

“Your servant, sir,” Uncle 
Binkster squeaked, mopping at his 
face with a large striped handker- 
chief. “Wouldst honor me by ac- 
cepting a cooling draft of pring- 
lizard milk and a lardy-tart?” 

“In sooth, Uncle, he needs 
something stronger than whey,” 
Prinkle objected. “And in sooth, 
The Plump Sausage offers fine 
ale — if your Grace can manage 
the approaches,” he added, com- 
paring Retief s six foot three with 
the doorway. 

“I’ll turn sideways,” Retief re- 
assured the Oberonian. He ducked 
through, was led across the 
crowded room by a bustling eight- 
een-inch tapman to a corner table, 
where he was able to squeeze him- 
self onto a narrow bench against 
the wall. 

“What’ll it be, gents?” the land- 
lord inquired. 

“Under the circumstances, I’ll 
stick to small beer,” Retief said. 



74 



IF 




“Ale for me,” Uncle Binkster 
said. “ ’Tis vice, perhaps, to tipple 
ere lunchtime, but with Tsuggs 
roaming the Quarter and batter- 
ing down walls, one’d best tipple 
while opportunity presents itself.” 
“A sound principle,” Retief 
agreed. “Who are these Tsuggs, 
Uncle Binkster?” 

«T AWLESS rogues, down 
A-'from the high crags for easy 
pickings,” the elderly baker re- 
plied with a sigh. “After you Ter- 
rans sent the Groaci packing, we 
thought all our troubles were over. 
Alas, I fear me ’tis not the case. 
As soon as the ruffians got the 
word the Five Eyes were pulling 
out, they came swarming down 
out of the hills like zing-bugs after 
a jam- wagon — ’tis plain they mean 
to elect their ruffianly chief, Hoo- 
brik the Uncouth. Bands of them 
roam the city, and the countryside 
as well, terrorizing the voters — ” 
He broke off as the landlord 
placed a foaming three-inch tank- 
ard before Retief. 

“Away with that thimble, 
Squirmkin!” he exclaimed. “Our 
guest requires a heartier bumper 
than that!” 

“ ’Tis an Emperor-sized mug,” 
the landlord said, “but I allow his 
dimensions dwarf it. Mayhap I can 
knock the top out of a hogshead 
. .” He hurried away. 

“Pray don’t mistake me, mi- 
lord,” Uncle Binkster resumed. 
“Like any patriot, I rejoiced to see 



the Sticky-finger go, leaving the 
conduct of Oberonian affairs to 
Oberonians. But who’d have 
guessed we normal-sized chaps 
would at once be subjected to de- 
pradations by our own oversized 
kith and kin exceeding anything 
the invaders ever practiced!” 

“A student of history might have 
predicted it,” Retief pointed out. 
“But I agree: being pushed around 
by local hoodlums is even less sat- 
isfying than being exploited from 
afar.” 

“Indeed so,” Prinkle agreed. “In 
the case of foreigners one can al- 
ways gain a certain relief by hurl- 
ing descriptive epithets, mocking 
their outlandish ways and blaming 
everything on their inherent moral 
leprosy — an awkward technique to 
use on one’s relatives.” 

The landlord returned, beaming, 
with a quart-sized wooden contain- 
er topped by a respectable head. 
Retief raised it in salute and drank 
deep. 

“And if what my nephew o’er- 
heard be any indication,” Uncle 
Binkster went on, wiping foam 
from his whiskers, “the worst is 
yet to come. Hast related all to 
our benefactor, lad?” 

“Not yet, Uncle.” Prinkle 
turned to Retief. “I was sweeping 
up crumbs in the VIP breakfast 
room, my mind on other matters, 
when I heard the word ‘Tsugg’ 
bandied among the company still 
sitting at table. I cocked an auricle, 
thinking to hear the scoundrels

roundly denounced, only to catch 
the intelligence that their chief that 
brawling bravo Hoobrik, represent- 
ing himself to be spokesman and 
natural leader of all Oberon, with- 
al, hath demanded audience of His 
Impressiveness, Ambassador Claw- 
hammer! ’Twas but natural that I 
undertook to disabuse their Lord- 
ships of this impertinent notion, 
accidentally overturning a pot of 
chocolate in process thereof — ” 
“Alas, my nephew is at times 
too enthusiastic in his espousal of 
his views,” Uncle Binkster put in. 
“Though ’tis beyond dispute, in 
this instance he was sorely tried.” 
“In sooth, so was his honor, 
Mr. Magnan, when the cocoa 
landed in his lap,” Prinkle ad- 
mitted. “Happily, ’twas somewhat 
cooled by long standing.” 

“A grotesque prospect,” Uncle 
Binkster ruminated. “Those scape- 
grace villains, lording it over us 
honest folk! Perish the thought, 
Sir Retief! I trow I’d sooner have 
the Five-eyes back!” 

“At least they maintained a de- 
gree of control over the ne’r-do- 
wells,” Prinkle said, “restricting 
them to their hills and caves.” 

“As will we, lad, once the elec- 
tion is consummated,” Uncle 
Binkster reminded the youth. 
“Naturally, we Twilpritt stand 
ready to assume the burden of po- 
licing the rabble, as is only right 
and natural, as soon as our slate 
is elected, by reason of our super- 
visor virtues — ” 



“Hark not to the old dodderer’s 
maunderings, Giant,” a tiny voice 
peeped from the next table. A min- 
iature Oberonian, no more than 
nine inches tall, raised his one- 
ounce glass in salute. “We Chim- 
berts, being nature’s noblemen, 
are of course divinely appointed to 
a position of primacy among these 
lumbering brutes, saving your 
presence, milord — ” 

“Dost hear a dust-cricket chirp- 
ing in the woodwork?” a medium- 
sized Oberonian with black circles 
resembling spectacles around his 
eyes inquired loudly from three 
tables away. “ ’Twere plain e’en to 
an outworlder that we Choobs are 
the rightful inheritors of the man- 
tle of superiority. Once in office 
we’ll put an end to such public 
rantings.” 

“You in office?” Prinkle yelped. 
“O’er my corpse, varlet!” He 
leaped up, slopping beer as he 
cocked his arm to peg the mug at 
the offender. 

“Stay, nephew!” Uncle Binkster 
restrained the youth. “Pay no heed 
to the wretch, doubtless he’s in his 
cups — ” 

“Drunk, am I, you old sot!” the 
Choob yelled, overturning the ta- 
ble as he leaped up, grabbing for 
the hilt of his foot-long sword. 
“I’ll ha’ a strip o’ thy wrinkled 
hide for that allegation — ” His 
threat was cut off abruptly as a 
tankard, hurled from across the 
room, clipped him over the ear, 
sending him reeling into the next

table, whose occupants leaped up 
with indignant shouts and flailing 
fists. 

“Gentlemen, time, time!” the 
landlord wailed, before diving be- 
hind the bar amid a barrage of 
pewter. Retief finished his beer in 
a long swallow and rose, looming 
over the battle raging about his 
knees. 

“A pleasure, gentlemen,” he 
addressed the room at large. “I 
hate to leave such a friendly gath- 
ering, but Staff Meeting time is 
here.” 

“Farewell, Sir Retief,” Prinkle 
panted from under the table, where 
he grappled with a pale-furred lo- 
cal of about his own weight. “Call 
around any time for a drop and a 
bit of friendly political chat.” 

“Thanks,” Retief said. “If things 
get too slow in the front line 
trenches I’ll remember your invita- 
tion.” 

II 

A S RETIEF entered the confer- 
ence room — a converted pack- 
ing room in the former warehouse 
temporarily housing the Terran 
Mission to the newly liberated 
planet Oberon — First Secretary 
Magnan gave him a sour look. 

“Well — here you are at last. I’d 
begun to fear you’d lingered to 
roister with low companions in 
your usual manner.” 

“Not quite my usual manner,” 
Retief corrected. “We’d barely 



started to roister when I remem- 
bered Staff Meeting. By the way, 
what do you know about a fellow 
called Hoobrik the Uncouth?” 
Magnan looked startled. “Why, 
that name is known only to a 
handful of us in the inner security 
circle,” he said in a lowered tone, 
glancing about. “Who leaked it to 
you, Retief?” 

“A few hundred irate locals. 
They didn’t seem to know it was a 
secret.” 

“Well, whatever you do, act sur- 
prised when the Ambassador men- 
tions it,” Magnan cautioned his 
junior as they took seats at the 
long table. “My,” he went on as 
the shouts of the crowd outside the 
building rose to a thunderous level, 
“how elated the locals are, now 
they realize we’ve relieved them of 
the burdens of Groaci overlord- 
ship! Hear their merry cries!” 
“Remarkable,” Retief agreed. 
“They have a better command of 
invective than the Groaci them- 
selves.” 

“Why, Wilbur,” Magnan said as 
Colonel Saddlesore, the Military 
Attache slipped into the chair be- 
side him, avoiding his glance. 
“However did you get that alarm- 
ing discoloration under your eye?” 
“Quite simple, actually.” The 
colonel bit off his words like bul- 
lets. “I was struck by a thrown 
political slogan.” 

Magnan sniffed. “There’s no 
need for recourse to sarcasm.” 
“The slogan,” Saddlesore ampli-

Tied, “was inscribed on the rind of 
a bham-bham fruit of the approxi- 
mate size and weight of a well-hit 
cricket ball.” 

“I saw three small riots myself 
on the way in to the office,” the 
Press Attache said in a pleased 
tone. “Remarkable enthusiasm 
these locals show for universal suf- 
frage.” 

“I think it’s time, however,” the 
Counselor put in ponderously, 
“that someone explained to them 
that the term ‘political machine’ 
does not necessarily refer to a me- 
dium tank.” 

The chatter around the long ta- 
ble cut off abruptly as Ambassa- 
dor Clawhammer, a small pink- 
faced man with an impressive 
paunch, entered the room, glow- 
ered at his staff as they rose, waved 
them to their seats as he waited for 
silence. 

“Well, gentlemen,” he looked 
around the table. “What progress 
have you to report aneht the prep- 
aration of the populace for the bal- 
loting?” 

A profound silence ensued. 

“What about you, Chester?” 
Clawhammer addressed the Coun- 
selor. “I seem to recall instructing 
you to initiate classes in parlia- 
mentary procedure among these 
riffraff — that is to say, among the 
free citizens of Oberon.” 

“I tried, Mr. Ambassador. I 
tried,” Chester said sadly. “They 
didn’t seem to grasp the idea quite. 
They chose up sides and staged a 



pitched battle for possession of the 
chair.” 

“Ah — I can report a teentsy bit 
of progress in my campaign to put 
across the idea of one man, one 
vote,” a slender- necked Political 
Officer spoke up. “They got the 
basic idea, all right.” He paused. 
“The only trouble was, they im- 
mediately deduced the corollary: 
one less man, one less vote.” He 
sighed, “Luckily, they were evenly 
matched, so no actual votes were 
lost.” 

“You might point out the corol- 
lary to the corollary,” Retief sug- 
gested, “the lighter the vote, the 
smaller the Post Office.” 

“What about your assigned task 
of voter registration, eh. Mag- 
nan?” the Chief of Mission barked. 
“Are you reporting failure too?” 
“Why, no indeed, sir, not exact- 
ly failure; at least not utter failure; 
it’s too soon to announce that — ” 
“Oh?” The Ambassador looked 
ominous. “When do you think 
would be an appropriate time? Af- 
ter disaster strikes?” 

“I’d like to propose a rule limit- 
ing the number of political parties 
to P minus 1, P being the number 
of voters,” Magnan said hastily. 
“Otherwise we run the risk that no 
one gets.a majority.” 

“No good, Magnan,” the Coun- 
selor for P R Affairs spoke up. 
“We don’t want t<5 risk a charge of 
meddling. However,” he added 
thoughtfully, “we might just up 
the nomination fee to a figure suf-

IF 




ficiently astronomical to keep the 
trash out — that is, to discourage 
the weakly motivated.” 

“I don’t know, Irving,” the Econ 
Officer ran his fingers through his 
thinning hair in a gesture of frus- 
tration. “What we really need is to 
prune the ranks of the voters more 
drastically. Now, far be it from me 
to propose strong-arm methods — 
but what if we tried out a modified 
Grandfather Rule?” 



AY — a touch of the tradi- 
tional might be in order at 
that, Oscar,” the Political Officer 
agreed tentatively. “Just what did 
you have in mind?” 

“Actually I haven’t worked out 
the details — but how about limit- 
ing the franchise to those who have 
grandfathers? Or possibly grand- 
children? Or even both?” 

“Gentlemen!” Ambassador 
Clawhammer cut short the debate. 
“We must open our sights. The 
election promises to degenerate 
into a debacle of ruinous propor- 
tions, career-wise, unless we break 
through with a truly fresh ap- 
proach.” He paused impressively. 
“Fortunately,” he continued in the 
modest tones of Caesar accepting 
the crown, “I have evolved such an 
approach.” He raised a hand in 
kindly remonstrance at the chorus 
of congratulations that broke out 
at his announcement. 

“It’s clear, gentlemen, that what 
is needed is the emergence of a po- 



litical force that will weld together 
the strands of Oberonian political 
coloration into a unified party 
capable of seating handy major- 
ities. A force conversant with the 
multitudinous benefits which would 
stem from a sympathetic attitude 
toward Terran interests in the Sec- 
tor.” 

“Yes, Chief,” an alert underling 
from the Admin Section took his 
cue. “But, gosh, who could pos- 
sibly produce such a miracle from 
the welter of divergent political 
creeds here on Oberon? They’re 
practically at swords’ points with 
each other over each and every 
question of policy, both foreign 
and domestic.” 

Clawhammer nodded acknowl- 
edgment. “Your question is an 
acute one, Dimplick. Happily, the 
answer is at hand. I have made 
contact, through confidential chan- 
nels, with a native leader of vast 
spiritual influence, who bids fair 
to fulfill the role to perfection.” 
He paused to allow, the staff to 
voice spontaneous expressions of 
admiration, then raised a palm for 
silence. 

“While ‘Golly!’ and ‘Wow!’ are 
perhaps less elegant effusions than 
one might logically expect from an 
assemblage of senior career diplo- 
mats,” he said sternly, but with a 
redeeming twinkle in his small, red- 
rimmed eyes, “I’ll overlook the 
lapse this time on the basis of your 
obvious shock at receiving such 
glad tidings after your own abys-

mal failures to produce any dis- 
cernible progress.” 

“Sir, may we know the name of 
this messiah?” Magnan chirped. 
“When do we get to meet him?” 
“Curious that you should em- 
ploy that particular term with ref- 
erence to Hoobrik,” Clawham- 
mer said complacently. “At this 
moment, the guru is meditating in 
the mountains, surrounded by his 
chelas, or disciples, known as 
Tsuggs in the local patois.” 

“Did you say — Hoobrik?” Mag- 
nan queried uncertainly. “Good- 
ness, what a coincidence that he 
should have the same name as that 
ruffian of a bandit chief who had 
the unmitigated effrontery to send 
one of his strong-arm men to 
threaten your Excellency!” 

Clawhammer’s pink features 
deepened to a dull magenta which 
clashed sharply with his lime-green 
seersucker suit. 

“I fear, Magnan,” he said in a 
tone like a tire-iron striking flesh, 
“that you’ve absorbed a number 
of erroneous impressions. His 
Truculence, Spiritual Leader Hoo- 
brik, dispatched an emissary, it’s 
true, to propose certain accommo- 
dations sphere-of-influence-wise; 
but to proceed from that circum- 
stance to an inference that I have 
yielded to undue pressures is an 
unwarranted speculative leap!” 
“Possibly I just misinterpreted 
his messenger’s phraseology, sir,” 
Magnan said with a tight little 
smile. “It didn’t seem to me that 



‘foreign blood-suckers’ and ‘crav- 
en paper-pushers’ sounded all that 
friendly.” 

“ ‘IPBM’s may fry our skins, 
but words will never hurt us,’ eh, 
sir?” the Econ Officer piped bright- 
ly, netting himself a stab of the 
Ambassadorial eye. 

“Still, it’s rather strong lan- 
guage,” Colonel Saddlesore spoke 
up to fill the conversational gap. 
“But I daresay you put the fellow 
in his place, eh, Mr. Ambassa- 
dor?” 

“Why, as to that, I’ve been pon- 
dering the precisely correct pos- 
ture to adopt vis-a-vis the Tsuggs, 
protocol-wise. I confess for a few 
moments I toyed with the idea of a 
beefed-up 804-B: Massive Dignity, 
with overtones of Leashed Ire; but 
cooler counsels soon prevailed.” 

“How about a 764, sir?” the 
Econ Officer essayed. “Amused 
Contempt, with just a hint of Un- 
pleasant Surprise in the Offing?” 

“Too subtle,” Colonel Saddle- 
sore grunted. “What about the old 
standby, 26-A?” 

“Oh, the old ‘Threat to Break 
Off Talks’ ploy, eh? Embellished 
with a side-issue of Table-Shape 
Dispute, I assume?” 



ENTLEM EN !” Clawham- 
mer called the conference to 
heel. “You forget that the date of 
the elections is rushing toward us! 
We’ve no time for traditional 
ploys. The problem is simple: how 




80 



IF 




best to arrive at a meeting of the 
minds with the guru.” 

“Why not just call him in and 
offer to back him in a takeover, 
provided he plays ball?” the PR 
Chief proposed bluntly. 

“I assume, Irving,” Clawham- 
mer said into the shocked silence, 
“that what you actually meant to 
suggest was that we give His Truc- 
ulence assurances of Corps sup- 
port in his efforts to promote 
Oberonian welfare — in the event of 
his securing the confidence of the 
electorate, as evinced by victory at 
the polls, of course.” 

“Yeah, something like that,” Ir- 
ving muttered, sliding down in his 
chair. 

“Now,” Clawhammer said, “the 
question remains, how best to ten- 
der my compliments to His Truc- 
ulence, isolated as he is in his re- 
mote fastness—” 

“Why, simple enough, sir,” 
Magnan said. “We just send a 
messenger along with an invita- 
tion to tea. Something impressive 
in a gold-embossed, I’d suggest.” 

“I understand this fellow Hoob- 
rik has ten thousand blood-thirsty 
cutthroats — ah, that is, wisdom- 
hungry students — at his beck and 
call,” the Econ Officer contrib- 
uted. “They say anybody who goes 
up there comes back with his tail 
cropped.” 

“Small hazard, since we Terries 
have no tails,” Magnan said. 

“I’ve got a funny feeling they’d 
figure out something else to 



crop,” Oscar retorted sharply. 

“Am I to infer, Magnan, you’re 
volunteering to convey the bid?” 
Clawhammer inquired blandly. 

“Me, sir?” Magnan paled visi- 
bly. “Heavens, I’d love to — except 
that I’m under observation for 
possible fourth-degree cocoa 
bums.” 

“Fourth-degree burns?” Colo- 
nel Saddlesore wondered aloud. 
“I’d like to see that. I’ve heard of 
first, second, and third degree, 
but — ” 

“The symptoms are invisible to 
lay inspection,” Magnan snapped. 
“Additionally, my asthma is ag- 
gravated by high altitudes.” 

“By Gad,” Colonel Saddlesore 
whispered to his neighbor, “/’d like 
a chance to confront these fel- 
lows — ” 

“Better wear your armor, Wil- 
bur,” his confidant replied. “From 
all reports, they weigh in at three 
hundred pounds and wear six-foot 
cutlasses with which they lay about 
them freely when aroused. And 
they say the sight of a Terry 
arouses them worse than any- 
thing.” 

“ — but, as I was about to say, 
my duties require that I hole up in 
my office for the forseeable fu- 
ture,” the colonel finished. 

“Cutlasses, you say?” the Econ 
Officer pricked up his ears. 
“Hmm. Might be a market here 
for a few zillion up-to-date hand- 
weapons — for police use only, of 
course.”

“Capital notion, Depew,’’ the 
Political Officer nodded approv- 
ingly. “Nothing like a little fire- 
power to bring out the natural 
peace-loving tendencies of the peo- 
ple.’’ 

“Now, gentlemen — let us avoid 
giving voice to any illiberal doc- 
trines,” Clawhammer said sharply. 
“Our only motive, let us remem- 
ber, is to bring the liberated popu- 
lace to terms with the political 
realities — in this case, the obvious 
need for a man on horseback — or 
should I say a Tsugg on Vornch- 
back?” The Terran envoy smiled 
indulgently at his whimsy. 

“I have a question, Mr. Ambas- 
sador,” Retief said. “Since we’re 
here to supervise free elections, 
why don’t we let the Oberonians 
work out their own political reali- 
ties?” 

Clawhammer looked blank. 

“Just — ah — how do you mean?” 
the Political Officer prompted un- 
easily. 

“Why don’t we let them nomi- 
nate whomever they want, vote for 
any candidate they like?” Retief 
explained. 

“I suggest you forget these rad- 
ical notions, young fellow,” Claw- 
hammer said sternly. “These free 
elections will be conducted in the 
way that free elections have always 
been conducted. And now that I’ve 
considered the matter, it occurs to 
me it might be valuable experience 
for you to pay the proposed call 
on His Truculence. It might serve 



to polish your grasp of protocol 
a trifle.” 

“But, sir,” Magnan spoke up. 
“I need Mr. Retief to help me do 
the Consolidated Report of Delin- 
quent Reports — ” 

“You’ll have to manage alone, I 
fear, Magnan. And now, back to 
the ramparts of democracy, gen- 
tlemen! As for you, Retief — ” The 
Ambassador fixed Retief with a 
sharp eye: “I suggest you comport 
yourself with a becoming modesty 
among the Tsugg. I should dislike 
to have report any unfortunate in- 
cident.” 

“I’ll do my best to see that no 
such report reaches you, sir,” Re- 
tief said cheerfully. 



Ill 

T HE green morning sun of 
Oberon shone down warmly as 
Retief, mounted on a wiry Struke, 
a slightly smaller and more docile 
cousin of the fierce Vorch tamed 
by the Tsuggs, rode forth from the 
city gates. Pink and yellow borms 
warbled in the tree tops; the elusive 
sprinch darted from grass tuft to 
grass tuft. The rhythmic whistling 
of doody-bugs crying to their 
young supplied a somnolent back- 
drop to the idyl. 

Retief passed through a region 
of small, tidy farms, where sturdy 
Doob peasants gaped from the 
furrows. The forest closed in as 
the path wound upward into the 



82 



IF 




foothills. In mid-afternoon he 
tethered the Struke and lunched 
beside a waterfall on pate sand- 
wiches and sparkling Bacchus 
Black from a coldflask. He was 
just finishing off his mousse 
eclaire when a two-foot steel ar- 
row whistled past his ear to bury 
itself six inches in the dense blue 
wood of a Nunu tree behind him. 

Retief rose casually, yawned, 
stretched, took out a vanilla dope 
stick and puffed it alight, at the 
same time scanning the under- 
brush. There was a quick move- 
ment behind a clump of Foon 
bushes; a second bolt leaped past 
him, almost grazing his shoulder, 
to rattle away in the brush. Ap- 
pearing to notice nothing, Retief 
took a leisurely step toward the 
Nunu tree, slipped suddenly behind 
it. With a swift motion he grasped 
a small, limber branch growing out 
at waist height on his side of the 
two-foot bole, bent it down and 
pegged the tip to the shaggy, por- 
ous bark, using the match-sized 
dope stick to pin it in place. Then 
he moved quickly away, keeping 
the tree between himself and the 
unseen archer, to the concealment 
of a dense patch of shrubbery. 

A minute passed; a twig popped. 
A bulky, tattooed Tsugg ap- 
peared, a vast, dumpy figufe clad 
in dirty silks, holding a short, 
thick, recurved bow clamped in 
one boulder-like Fist, a quarrel 
nocked, the string drawn. The da- 
coit tiptoed forward, jumped sud- 



denly around the tree. Finding his 
quarry fled, he turned, stood with 
his back to the tree peering into 
the undergrowth. 

At that moment, the bent 
branch, released by the burning of 
the dope stick, sprang outward, 
ramming the astounded bowman 
in the seat of his baggy green vel- 
veteen trousers. The arrow 
smacked into the dirt at his feet as 
he jumped, then stood rigid. 

“Don’t strike, sir!” he urged in 
a plaintive tenor. “The older lads 
put me up to it — ” 

Retief strolled from his shelter, 
nodded easily to the Tsugg, 
plucked the bow from his nerve- 
less grip. 

“Nice workmanship,” he said, 
inspecting the weapon. “Groaci 
trade goods?” 

“Trade goods?” the Tsugg said 
with a note of indignation. “Just 
because yer partner has a dirk at 
me back’s no cause to make 
mockery of me. I plundered it 
from the Five-eyes all open and 
aboveboard, so help me.” 

“Sorry,” Retief said. He with- 
drew the arrow from the loam, fit- 
ted it to the bow experimentally. 

“You’re not by chance a mem- 
ber of Hoobrik’s band, are you?” 
he inquired off-handedly. 

“Too right it’s not by chance,” 
the Tsugg said emphatically. “I 
went through the Ordeal, same’s 
the other lads.” 

“Lucky we met,” Retief said. 
“I’m on my way to pay a call on 



BALLOTS AND BANDITS 



83 




His Truculence. Can you lead 
me to him?” 

The Tsugg straightened his two- 
hundred-and-ninety-pound bulk. 
“Tell yer crony to do his worst,” 
he said with a small break in his 
voice. “Fim Gloob’ s not the Tsugg 
to play the treacher.” 

“It wasn’t exactly treachery I 
had in mind,” Retief demurred. 
“Just ordinary diplomacy.” 

“Yer threats will avail ye 
naught,” Fim Gloob declared. 

“I see what you mean,” Retief 
said. “Still, there should be some 
way of working this out.” 

“No outsider goes to the camp 
of Hoobrik but as a prisoner.” 
The Tsugg rolled his shiny black 
eyes at the Terran. “Ah, sir — 
would ye mind asking yer sidekick 
not to poke so hard? I fear me 
he’ll rip me weskit, stole for me by 
me aged mums it were, a rare 
keepsake.” 

“Prisoner, eh, Fim? By the way, 
I don’t have a sidekick.” 

“That being the way of it,” Fim 
Gloob said carefully, after a short, 
thoughtful pause, “who’d be the 
villain holding the blade to me kip- 
glands?” 

“As far as I know,” Retief said 
candidly, “there’s nobody here but 
you and me.” 



T HE Tsugg turned his head cau- 
tiously,. peered behind him. 
With a grunt of annoyance he 



snapped a finger at the offending 
bough. 

“Me and me overactive imagi- 
nation,” he snorted. “And now — ” 

He turned to Retief with a 
scowl. 

“Remember, I still have the 
bow,” Retief said pleasantly. 

“And a mort o’ good it’ll do 
ye,” Fim snarled, advancing. “On- 
ly a Tsugg born and bred has the 
arm to draw that stave!” 

“Oh?” Retief set the arrow and 
with an easy motion pulled until 
the arrowhead rested against the 
bow, the latter being bent into a 
sharp curve. Another inch — and 
the stout laminated wood snapped 
with a sharp twang. 

“I see what you mean,” Retief 
said. “But then the Groaci always 
did produce flimsy merchandise.” 

“You — you broke it!” Fim 
Gloob said in tones of deep dis- 
may. 

“Never mind — I’ll steal you a 
new one. We have some ladies’ 
models in the Recreation Kits that 
ought not to overstrain you.” 

“But — I’m reckoned the stout- 
est bowman in the band.” 

“Don’t give it another thought, 
Fim. They’ll love you when you 
bring in a live Terry, single-hand- 
ed.” 

“Who, me?” 

“Of course. After all, I’m alone 
and unarmed. How could I re- 
sist?” 

“Aye— but still—” 

“Taking me in as a prisoner

IF 




would look a lot better than hav- 
ing me saunter in on my own and 
tell Hoobrik you showed me the 
route.” 

“Wouldst do such a dirty 
trick?” Fim gasped. 

“I wouldst — unless we start im- 
mediately,” Retief assured the 
Tsugg. 

Fim sighed. “I guess I know 
when I’m licked. I mean when 
you’re licked. Let’s go, prisoner. 
And let’s hope His Truculence is 
in a good mood. Otherwise he’ll 
clap ye on the rack and have the 
whole tale out of ye in a trice!” 

IV 

A FEW dozen heavyweights laz- 
ing about the communal 
cooking pot or sprawling in the 
shade under the striped awnings 
stretched between the trees looked 
up in mild interest as Retief ap- 
peared on struke-back, Fim Gloob 
behind him astride his Vorch, 
glowering ferociously as he verb- 
ally prodded the lone Terran for- 
ward. 

“Ho, that’s far enough,” he 
roared. “Dismount, while I seek 
instruction o’ His Truculence 
whether to h’ist ye out of hand or 
ha’ a bit o’ sport wi’ ye first.” 

“Ha, what be this, Gloob?” a 
bulky outlaw boomed as Retief 
swung down from the saddle. “An 
off-worlder, I trow!” 

“That he’s no Oberonian, is 
plain,” another offered. “Mayhap 



a two-eyed variety o’ Five-eyes.” 

Fim yelled, “Clear the way — 
I’ve fetched this Terry here to di- 
vert the great Hoobrik wi’ his 
saucy sayings.” 

“Here, what passes?” a familiar 
baritone cut through the clamor. 
A large Tsugg in a red sash pushed 
through the mob, which gave way 
grudgingly, with much muttering. 
The newcomer halted with a jerk 
when his eye fell on Retief. 

“Methinks,” he said, “I’ve seen 
you before, sirrah.” 

“We’ve met,’* Retief acknowl- 
edged. 

“Though all you Terries look 
alike to me.” Dir Blash fingered 
his jaw gingerly. “Meseemeth 
’twas in the Street of the Sweet- 
makers — ” 

“So it was.” 

“Aha! I’ve got it!” Dir Blash 
clapped Retief on the shoulder. 
“My boon companion! Ah, bul- 
lies,” he addressed his fellows, 
“this Terry gave me a shot of 
something with a kick like a 
Vorch — though for the life of me 
I can’t recall the precise circum- 
stances. How wert thou yclept 
again, sirrah?” 

“Retief; lucky you have the 
kind of memory you do, Dir 
Blash; your compatriots were just 
debating the best method of put- 
ting me out of my misery.” 

“Say you so?” Dir Blash looked 
around threateningly, his hand on 
the hilt of his cutlass. “Nobody 
murders my drinking buddies but

me.^He turned back to Retief. 
“Say, you wouldn’t chance to have 
any more of the same, would 
you?’’ 

“I’m saving it for a special oc- 
casion,’’ Retief said. 

“Well, what could be more 
special than a reprieve from being 
staked out on a zing-wasp hive, 
eh?” 

“We’ll celebrate later,” Retief 
said. “Right now I’d appreciate a 
short interview with His Trucu- 
lence.” 

“If I use my influence to get 
you in, wilt let me have another 
sample later?” 

“If things work out as they usu- 
ally do,” Retief said, “I think you 
can be sure of it.” 

“Then come along, Dir Retief. 
I’ll see what I can do.” 

H OOBRIK the Uncouth, 
lounging in a hammock under 
a vari-colored canopy, gazed in- 
differently at Retief as Dir Blash 
made the introductions. He was 
an immense Tsugg, above the aver- 
age height of his kind, his obesity 
draped in voluminous beaded 
robes. He selected a large green 
berry from a dented silver bowl at 
his elbow, shook exotic salts over 
it from a heavy gold saltshaker 
and popped it into his mouth. 

“So?” he grunted, spitting the 
seeds over the side. “Why disturb 
my meditations with trifles? Dis- 
pose of the creature in any way 
that amuses you, Blash — but save 



the head. I’ll impale it on a pike 
and give it to the Terry chieftain — 
gift-wrapped, of course.” 

Dir Blash nodded, scratching 
himself under the ribs. “Well, thus 
doth the tart disintegrate, Retief,” 
he said in tones of mild regret. 
“Let’s go— ” 

“I don’t want to be a spoilsport, 
your Truculence,” Retief spoke 
up, “but Ambassador Clawham- 
mer only allows his staff to be de- 
capitated at Tuesday morning 
staff meetings.” 

“Staff meetings?’’ Hoobrik 
wondered aloud. “Is that anything 
like a barbecue?” 

“Close,” Retief agreed. “Quite 
often a diplomat or two are flayed 
alive and roasted over a slow fire.” 
“Hmm.” Hoobrik looked 
thoughtful. “Maybe I should in- 
troduce the custom here. “My 
wish is to. keep up with the latest 
trends in government.” 

“In that connection,” Retief 
said, offering the stiff parchment 
envelope containing the invitation 
to the reception, “His Excellency 
the Terrestrial Ambassador Ex- 
traordinary and Minister Pleni- 
potentiary presents his compli- 
ments and requests me to hand 
you this.” 

“Eh? What be this?” Hoobrik 
fingered the document gingerly. 

“Ambassador Clawhammer re- 
quests the honor of your company 
at a ceremonial affair celebrating 
the election,” Retief explained. 
“Ceremonial affair?” Hoobrik

IF 




shifted uneasily, causing the ham- 
mock to sway dangerously. “What 
kind of ceremony?” 

“Just a small semi-formal gath- 
ering of kindred souls. It gives 
everyone a chance to show off 
their clothes and exchange veiled 
insults face to face.” 

“Waugh! What kind of contest 
is this? Give me a good hand-to- 
hand disemboweling any day!” 
“That comes later,” Retief said. 
“It’s known as Dropping by the 
Residence for a Drink. After the 
Party.” 



44 TT HATH an ominous sound,” 
A Hoobrik muttered. “Is it pos- 
sible you Terries are more fero- 
cious than I’d suspected?” 

“Ha!” Dir Blash put in. “I my- 
self dispatched half a dozen of the 
off-worlders only this morning 
when they sought to impede my 
entrance to a grog shop in the vil- 
lage.” 

“So?” Hoobrik yawned. “Too 
bad. For a moment, things were 
begining to look interesting.” He 
tore a corner off the gold-edged 
invitation and used it to poke at a 
bit of fruit rind wedged between 
his teeth. “Well, off with you, 
Blash — unless you want to play a 
featured role at my first staff 
meeting.” 

“Come, Terry,” the red-sashed 
Tsugg growled, reaching for Ret- 
ief s arm. “I just remembered the 



part of yesterday’s carouse that 
had slipped my mind.” 

“I think,” Retief said, evading 
the sub-chiefs grab, “it’s time for 
that jolt I promised you.” He 
stepped in close and rammed a 
pair of pile-drive punches to Dir 
Blash’s midriff, laced a hard right 
to the jaw as the giant doubled 
over and fell past him, out cold. 

“Here!” Hoobrik yelled. “Is 
that any way to repay my hospi- 
tality?” He stared down at his fal- 
len henchman. “Dir Blash, get up, 
thou malingerer, and avenge my 
honor!” 

Dir Blash groaned. One foot 
twitched. He settled back with a 
snore. 

“My apologies,” Retief said, 
easing the Groaci pistol from in- 
side his shirt. “Protocol has never 
been my strong suit. Having com- 
mitted a faux pas , I’d best be on 
my way. Which route would be 
least likely to result in the demise 
of any of your alert sentries?” 
“Stay, off-worlder. Wouldst 
spread tidings of this unflattering 
event abroad, to the detriment of 
my polling strength?” 

“Word might leak out,” Retief 
conceded. “Especially if any of 
your troops get in my way.” 

“ ’Tis a shame not to be borne!” 
Hoobrik said hoarsely. “All Ober- 
on knoweth that only a Tsugg can 
smite another Tsugg senseless.” 
He looked thoughtful. “Still, if the 
molehill will not come to Meyer, 
Meyer must to the molehill, as the

saying goeth. Since thou hast in 
sooth felled my liegeman, it fol- 
lows you must be raised at once to 
Tsugghood, legitimizing the event 
after the fact, as it were.” 

“I’d be honored,’’ Retief said 
amiably. “Provided, of course, 
that you authorize me to convey 
your gracious acceptance of His 
Excellency’s invitation.” 

Hoobrik looked glum. “Well — 
we can always loot the Embassy 
afterward. Very well, Terry — 
Tsugg-to-be, that is. Done!” The 
chieftain heaved his bulk from the 
hammock, stirred Dir Blash with 
a booted toe, at which the latter 
groaned and sat up. 

“Up, sluggard!” Hoobrik 
roared. “Summon a few varlets to 
robe me for a formal occasion! 
And my guest will require suitable 
robes, too.” He glanced at Retief. 
“But don’t don them yet, lest they 
be torn and muddied.” 

“The ceremony sounds rather 
strenuous,” Retief commented. 

“Not the ceremony,” Hoobrik 
corrected. “That cometh later. 
First cometh the Ordeal. If you 
survive that I’ll have my tailor fit 
you out as befits a sub-chief of the 
Tsugg.” 

T HE Ceremonial Site for Or- 
deal Number One — a clearing 
on a forest slope with a breath-tak- 
ing view of the valley below — was 
crowded with Tsugg tribesmen, 
good-naturedly quarreling, shout- 
ing taunts, offering and accepting 



wagers and challenges, passing 
wineskins from hand to grimy 
hand. 

“All right, everybody out of the 
Ring of the First Trial,” Dir Blash 
shouted, implementing his sugges- 
tion with hearty buffets left and 
right. “Unless ye plan to share the 
novitiate’s hazards.” 

The mountaineers gave ground, 
leaving an open space some Fifty 
feet in diameter, ta the center of 
which Retief was led. 

“All right, the least ye can do is 
give the off-worlder breathing 
space.” Dir Blash exhorted the by- 
standers to edge back another 
yard. “Now, Retief — this is a sore 
trial, ’tis true, but ’twill show you 
the mettle of the Tsugg, that we 
impose so arduous a criterion on 
oursel’s!” He broke off at a sound 
of crashing in the underbrush. A 
pair of tribesmen on the outer 
fringe of the audience flew into the 
air as if blown up by a mine, as 
with ferocious snorts, a wild 
Vorch, seven feet at the shoulder 
and armed with down-curving 
tusks, charged from the under- 
brush. His rush carried him 
through the ranks of the specta- 
tors into the inner circle, his short 
tail whipping, his head tossing as 
he sought a new target. His in- 
flamed eye fell on Dir Blash. 

“Botheration,” the latter com- 
mented in mild annoyance as the 
beast lowered its head and 
charged. Leaning aside, the Tsugg 
raised a fist of the size and weight

IF 




of a hand-axe, brought it down 
with a resounding bronggl on the 
carnivore’s skull. The unlucky 
beast folded in mid-leap, skidded 
chin-first to fetch up against Ret- 
iefs feet. 

“Nice timing,” he remarked. 

“Ye’d think the brute did it a- 
purpose, to plague a serious oc- 
casion,” Dir Blash said disapprov- 
ingly. “Drag the silly creature 
away,’’ he directed a pair of 
Tsugg. “He’ll be broke to harness 
for his pains. And now,” he turned 
to Retief, “if ye’re ready — ” 

Retief smiled encouragingly. 

“Right, then. The first trial is 
— take a deep breath and hold it 
for the count of ten.” Dir Blash 
watched Retief s expression alertly 
for signs of dismay. Seeing none, 
he raised a finger disappointedly. 

“Very well. Inhale.” 

Retief inhaled. 

“O netwothreefourfives ix se ve n- 
eightnineten,” Dir Blash said in a 
rush and stared curiously at the 
Terran, who stood relaxed before 
him. A few approving shouts 
rang out. Then came scattered 
hand-claps. 

“Well,” Dir Blash grunted. 
“You did pretty fair, I suppose, 
for an off-worlder. Hardly turned 
blue at all. You pass, I suppose.” 

“Hey,” someone called from 
the front rank of the gallery. 
“He’s not—” 

“Not still — ” someone else 
queried. 

“Still holding his breath?” a 



third Tsugg then asked wondering- 

iy- 

“O’ course not, lack wits!” Dir 
Blash bellowed. “How could he? 
E’en Grand Master Cutthroat Dir- 
dir Hooch held out but to the 
count of twelve!” He looked 
closely at Retief. “Thou hast in- 
deed resumed respiration?” he 
murmured. 

“Of course,” Retief reassured 
the Tsugg. “I was just grandstand- 
ing.” 

Dir Blash grunted. “In sooth, 
I’ve a feeling ye went a good thir- 
teen, if truth were known,” he 
muttered confidentially. “Hast 
made a specialty of suffocation?” 

“Staff meetings, remember?” 
Retief prompted. 

“To be sure.” Dir Blash looked 
disgruntled. “Well, on to the Sec- 
ond Trial, Terry. Ye’ll find this 
one e’en a straiter test of Tsugg- 
hood than the last!” He led the 
way upslope, Retief close behind, 
the crowd following. The path de- 
teriorated into a rocky gully wind- 
ing up between nearly vertical 
walls of rock. Pebbles rattled 
around the party from the crumb- 
ling cliffs above as members clam- 
bered toward choice vantage 
points. A medium-sized boulder 
came bounding down from a crag 
to whistle overhead and crash 
thunderously away among the 
trees below. The journey ended in 
a small natural amphitheater, the 
floor of which was thickly littered 
with stones of all sizes. Spectators

took up positions around the per- 
iphery above as pebbles continued 
to clatter down around the tester 
and testee, who stood alone at the 
center of the target. A head-sized 
rock smashed down a yard from 
Retief. A chunk the size of a 
grand piano poised directly above 
him gave- an ominous rumble and 
slid downward six inches amid a 
shower of gravel. 

“What happens if one of those 
scores a bull’s-eye on the candi- 
date?’’ Retief inquired. 

“It’s considered a bad omen,’’ 
Dir Blash said. “Drat the pesky 
motes!’’ he added as a small frag- 
ment bounded off the back of his 
neck. “These annoyances detract 
from the solemnity of the occa- 
sion.’’ 

“On the contrary,’’ Retief de- 
murred politely. “I think they add 
a lot of interest to the situation.’’ 

“Umm. Mayhap.’’ Dir Blash 
gazed absently upward, moving his 
head slightly to avoid being 
brained by a baseball-sized missile. 
“Now, off-worlder,” he addressed 
Retief, “prepare for the moment 
of truth. Bend over — ’’ he paused 
impressively — ’’ and touch your 
toes!’’ 

“Do I get to bend my knees?’’ 
Retief temporized. 

“Bend whatever you like,’’ Dir 
Blash said with airy contempt. “I 
trow this is one feat ye’ve not 
practiced at your Ordeal of the 
Staff Meeting!’’ 

“True,” Retief conceded. “The 



closest we come is lifting ourselves 
by our bootstraps.’’ He assumed a 
serious expression, bent over and, 
with a smooth motion, touched 
his fingertips to his toes. 

“He did it in one try,’’ someone 
called. 

“Didn’t even take a bounce!’’ 
another added. 

The applause was general. 

“Lacking in style,’’ Dir Blash 
grumbled. “But a pass, I allow. 
But now you face the Third Or- 
deal, where ye’re tricks will do ye 
no good. Come along.’’ They 
moved off. The stone piano 
crunched down on the spot he and 
Retief had just vacated. 

V 

T HE route to the Third Site led 
upward through a narrow cut 
to emerge on a bare rock slope. 
Fifty feet away a flat-topped rock 
spire loomed up from the depths, 
joined to the main mass of the 
peak by a meandering ribbon of 
rock some six inches in width, ex- 
cept where it narrowed to a knife 
edge, halfway across. Dir Blash 
sauntered out across the narrow 
bridge, gazing around him at the 
scenery. 

“A splendid prospect, eh, Ret- 
ief?’’ he called over his shoulder. 
“Look on it well; it may be thy 
last. What comes next has broken 
many a strong Tsugg down into a 
babbling Glert.’’ 

Retief tried the footing; it held. 
Keeping his eyes on the platform

IF 




ahead, he walked quickly across. 

“Now,” Dir Blash said, “you 
may wish to take a moment to 
commune with your patron devils 
or whatever it is you off-worlders 
burn incense to.” 

“Thanks, I’m in good shape in- 
cantation-wise,” Retief reassured 
him. “Only last night I joined in a 
toast to the auditors.” 

“In that case — ” Dir Blash 
pointed impressively to a flat stone 
that lay across two square rocks, 
the top of which cleared the 
ground by a good twelve inches. 

“Leap the obstacle in a single 
bound.” 

Retief studied the hurdle from 
several angles before taking up his 
position before it. 

“I see you hesitate,” Dir Blash 
taunted. “Dost doubt thy powers 
at last, Terry?” 

“Last year an associate of mine 
jumped fifty names on the promo- 
tion list,” Retief said. “Can I do 
less?’’ Standing flat-footed, he 
hopped over the barrier. Turning, 
he hopped back again. 

There was a moment of stunned 
silence. 

Suddenly pandemonium broke 
out Dir Blash hesitated only a 
moment, then joined in the glad 
cries. 

“Congratulations, Dir Tief!” he 
bellowed, pounding the Terran on 
the shoulder. “I warrant an off- 
worlder of thy abilities would be 
an embarrassment to all hands — 
but in sooth thou’rt now a Tsugg 



of the Tsuggs, and thy attainments 
are an adornment to our ilk!” 

EMARKABLE,” said Hoo- 
brik the Uncouth as he 
stuffed a handful of sugar-coated 
green olives into his mouth. “Ac- 
cording to Blash you went through 
the Ordeal like a Tsugg to the pa- 
vilion born. I may keep you on as 
bodyguard, Dir Tief, after I get 
the pavilion born. I may keep you 
on as bodyguard. Dir Tief, after I 
get the vote out and myself in.” 
“Coming from your Trucu- 
lence, that’s praise indeed,” Retief 
said. “Considering your willing- 
ness to offer yourself as a candi- 
date without a whimper.” 

“What’s to whimper?” Hoobrik 
demanded. “After my lads have 
rounded up more voters than the 
opposition can muster, I’ll be free 
to fill my pockets as best I may. 
’Tis a prospect I face calmly.” 
“True,” Retief said. “But first 
there are a few rituals to be gotten 
past. There’s Whistle-stopping, 
Baby-kissing, Fence-sitting, and 
Mud-slinging, plus a considerable 
amount of Viewing with Alarm.” 
“Hmm.” Hoobrik rubbed his 
chin thoughtfully. “Are these Or- 
deals the equal of our Rites of 
Tsugghood, Retief?” 

“Possibly even worse,” Retief 
solemnly assured the chieftain. 
“Especially if you wear an Indian 
war bonnet.” 

“Out upon it!’’ Hoobrik 
pounded his tankard on the table.

“A Tsugg fears neither man nor 
beast.” 

“But did you ever face a quor- 
um of Women Voters?” Retief 
countered quickly. 

“My stout lads will ride down 
all opposition,” Hoobrik declared 
with finality. “I’ve already made 
secret arrangements with certain 
Five-eyed off-worlders to supply 
me with all the write-in ballots I 
need to make everything legal and 
proper. Once in office, I can settle 
down to businesslike looting in an 
orderly manner.” 

“But remember,” Retief cau- 
tioned, “You’ll be expected tOi 
stand on your Party Platform— 
at least for the first few weeks.” 
“W-weeks?” Hoobrik faltered. 
“What is this platform, Retief?” 
“It’s a pretty shaky structure,” 
Retief confided. “I’ve never known 
one to last past the first Legislative 
Rebuff.” 

“What, yet another Ordeal?” 
“Don’t worry about it, your 
Truculence; it seldom goes as far 
as Impeachment.” 

“Well? Don’t keep me in sus- 
pense!” Hoobrik roared. “What 
doth this rite entail?” 

“This is where your rival politi- 
cians get even with you for win- 
ning, by charging you with High 
Crimes and Misdemeanors — ” 
“Stay!” Hoobrik yelled. “Is 
there no end to these torments?” 
“Certainly,” Retief reassured 
the aroused leader. “After you 
retire, you become a Statesman 



and are allowed out on alternate 
All Fools Days to be queried as to 
your views on any subject suffi- 
ciently trivial to grace the pages of 
the Sunday Supplements.” 

“Arrrhh!” Hoobrik growled and 
drained his mug. “See here, Ret- 
ief,” he said. “On pondering the 
matter, methinks ’twould be a gra- 
cious gesture on my part to take 
second place on the ticket and let 
a younger Tsugg assume party 
leadership; you, for example, 
Blash,” he addressed the sub-chief. 

“Who, me?” the latter blurted. 
“Nay, my liege — as I’ve said be- 
fore, I am not now and do not in- 
tend to be a candidate.” 

“Who, then?” Hoobrik waved 
his arms in agitation. “We need a 
Tsugg who’ll appeal to a broad 
spectrum of voters. A good scimi- 
tarman for beating down opposi- 
tion inside the party, a handy club- 
wielder to bring in the Indepen- 
dents, a cool hand with a dirk, for 
committee infighting — ” He 

paused, looking suddenly thought- 
ful. 

“Well, I’ll leave you gentlemen 
to look over the lists,” Retief said, 
rising. “May I tell the Ambassa- 
dor to expect you at the post-elec- 
tion victory reception?” 

“We’ll be there,” Hoobrik said. 
“And I think I have a sure-fire 
Tsugg standard-bearer in mind to 
pull in the vote — ” 

I N THE varicolored glow of 
lights strung in the hedges ring-

IF 




ing the former miniature golf 
course pressed into service as Em- 
bassy grounds, the Terran diplo- 
mats stood in conversation clumps 
across the fairways and greens, 
glasses in hand, nervously eyeing 
the door through which Ambassa- 
dor Clawhammer’s entrance was 
expected momentarily. 

Magnan said to Retief, glanc- 
ing at his watch, “The first results 
will be in any moment.” 

“I think we need have no fear of 
the outcome,” Saddlesore stated. 
“Guru Hoobrik’s students have 
been particularly active in these 
final hours, zealously applying 
posters to the polling places.” 

“And applying knots to the 
heads of reluctant converts,” the 
Political Officer added. “What I’m 
wondering is — after Hoobrik’s 
inauguration, what’s to prevent 
his applying the same techniques 
to foreign diplomats?” 

“Tradition, my boy,” the colo- 
nel said soothingly. “We may be 
shot as spies or deported as un- 
desirables — but shaped up by 
wardheelers, no.” 

A stir crossed the lawn. Am- 
bassador Clawhammer appeared, 
ornate in the Burgundy cutaway 
and puce jodpurs specified by CDT 
Regs for early evening ceremonial 
wear. 

“Well? No word yet?” He 
stared challengingly at his under- 
lings, accepting one of the four 
drinks simultaneously thrust at 
him by alert junior officers. “My 



private polls indicate an early lead 
for the Tsugg party, increasing to 
a commanding majority as the 
rural counties report.” 
“Commanding is right,” Mag- 
nan muttered behind his hand. 
“One of the ruffians had the auda- 
city to order me to hold his glue- 
pot while he affixed a poster to the 
front door of the Embassy.” 

“What cheek,” the Political Of- 
ficer gasped. “You didn’t do it?” 
“Of course not. “He held the 
gluepot, and I affixed the pla- 
card.” 

Happy shouts sounded from the 
direction of the gate; a party of 
Tsugg appeared, flamboyant in 
pink and yellow, handing out foot- 
long yellow cigars. A throng of 
lesser Oberonians followed, all ap- 
parently in good spirits. 

“A landslide victory,” one called 
to the assembly at large. “Break 
out the wassail bowl!” 

“Is this official. Depew?” the 
Ambassador demanded of his 
Counselor, who arrived at that 
moment at a trot, waving a sheaf 
of papers. 

“I’m afraid so — that is, I’m de- 
lighted to confirm the people’s 
choice,” he panted. “It’s amazing 
— the Tsugg candidate polled an 
absolute majority, even in the op- 
positions’ strongholds. It looks 
like every voter on the rolls voted 
the straight Tsugg ticket.” 

“Certes, Terry,” a Grimble 
confirmed jovially, grabbing two 
glasses from a passing tray. “We

know a compromise candidate 
when we see one.” 

“ ’Tis a clear mandate from the 
people,” a Tsugg declaimed. 
“Hoobrik will be along in a trice 
to help with sorting out the spoils. 
As for myself, I’m not greedy; a 
minor Cabinet post will do nice- 
ly" 

“Out upon thee!” a jovial voice 
boomed as the Tsugg chieftain 
swept through the gate, flanked by 
an honor guard of grinning scimi- 
tar-bearers. “No undignified root- 
ing at the trough, lads — there’s 
plenty to go around.” 

“Congratulations, your Trucu- 
lence,” Ambassador Clawhammer 
cried, advancing with outstretched 
hand. “I’m sure that at this mo- 
ment you’re feeling both proud 
and humble as you point with 
pride — ” 

“Humble?” Hoobrik roared. 
“That’s for losers, Terry.” 

“To be sure.” Clawhammer 
conceded the point. “Now, your 
Truculence, I don’t want to delay 
the victory celebration — but why 
don’t we first just sign this little 
Treaty of Eternal Peace and 
Friendship, set up to run for five 
years with a renewal option — ” 
“You’ll have to speak to the 
new Planetary President about 
that, Terry,” the chieftain waved 
the proffered document away. 
“As for myself, I have some im- 
portant drinking to catch up on.” 
“But — I was informed by a usu- 
ally reliable source — ” Clawham- 



mer turned to glare at the Coun- 
selor — “that the Tsugg party had 
carried off all honors.” 

“True enough. By the way, 
where is he?” 

“Where is who?” 

“Our new Chief Executive, of 
course — ” Hoobrik broke off, 
pushed past Clawhammer, rushed 
forward with outstretched arms, 
narrowly missing a small water 
hazard, to embrace Retief, who 
had just appeared on the scene. 

“Stand aside, Retief,” Claw- 
hammer snapped. “I’m in the 
midst of a delicate negotiation — ” 
“Employ a more respectful 
tone, Terry,” Hoobrik admon- 
ished the Ambassador sternly. 
“Consider to whom you’re speak- 
ing.” 

“To whom I’m speak?” Claw- 
hammer said in bewilderment. 
“Whom am I speaking to?” 

“Meet Planetary President Dir 
Tief,” Hoobrik said proudly, wav- 
ing a hand at Retief. “The winner 
—and new champion.” 



<</^OOD lord, Retief,” Magnan 
VJ was the first to recover his 
speech. “When? How?” 

“What’s the meaning of this?” 
Clawhammer burst out. “Am I 
being made sport of?” 

“Apparently not, Mr. Ambassa- 
dor,” Retief said. “It seems they 
put me on the ballot as a dark 
horse — ” 

“You’ll be a horse of a darker

color before I’m through with 
you — ” Clawhammer went rigid as 
twin scimitars flashed, ended with 
their points pressed against his 
neck. 

“But how can a Terran be elect- 
ed as head of the Tsugg party?” 
the Political Officer asked. 

“President Tief is no Terry,” 
Hoobrik corrected. “He’s a Tsugg 
after my own heart!” 

“But — doesn’t the president 
have to be a natural-born citizen?” 
“Art suggesting our President is 
unnatural-born?” Hoobrik grated. 
“Why, no—” 

“ ’Tis well. In that case, best you 
present your credentials at once 
and we can get down to business.” 
Clawhammer hesitated. A prod 
of the blade at his jugular assisted 
him in finding his tongue. 

“Why, ah, Mr. President— will 
your Excellency kindly tell your 
thugs to put those horrible-look- 
ing knives away?” 

“Certainly, Mr. Ambassador,” 
Retief said easily. “Just as soon 
as we’ve cleared up a few points in 
the treaty. I think it would be a 
good idea if the new planetary gov- 
ernment has a solemn CDT guar- 
antee of noninterference in elec- 
tions from now on — ” 

“Retief — you wouldn’t dare — I 
mean, of course, my boy, what- 
ever you say.” 

“Also, it would be a good idea 
to strike out those paragraphs 
dealing with CDT military advi- 
sors, technical experts and fifty- 



credit-a-day economists. We Ober- 
onians would prefer to work out 
our own fate.” 

“Yes — yes — of course, Mr. 
President. And now — ” 

“And as to the matter of the 
one-sided trade agreement — why 
don’t we just scrap that whole sec- 
tion and substitute a free com- 
merce clause?” 

“Why — if I agree to that they’ll 
have my scalp, back in the Depart- 
ment!” 

“That’s better than having it 
tied to a pole outside my tent,” 
Hoobrik pointed out succinctly. 

“On the other hand,” Retief 
said, “I think we Tsuggs can see 
our way clear to supply a modest 
security force to ensure that noth- 
ing violent happens to foreign dip- 
lomats among us as long as they 
stick to diplomacy and leave all 
ordinary crime to us Oberonians.” 

“Agreed,” Clawhammer squak- 
ed. “Where’s the pen?” 

It took a quarter of an hour to 
delete the offending paragraphs, 
substitute new wording and affix 
signatures to the imposing docu- 
ment establishing formal relations 
between the Corps Diplomatique 
Terrestrienne and the Republic of 
Oberon. When the last length of 
red tape had been affixed and the 
last blob of sealing wax applied, 
Retief called for attention. 

“Now that Terran-Oberonian 
relations are off on a sound foot- 
ing,” he said, “I feel it’s only ap-

T HE view of the geometrically 
flattened grass in the garden 
quad of Skag College was a luster- 
ous green this spring. Professor 
James Whytebom watched it rath- 
er distantly through a small win- 
dow. Some athletic students, the 
jolly-hockeysticks type, were prac- 
ticing pitching a cricket ball back 
and forth. Insects buzzed their du- 
tiful rounds among drowsy flow- 
ers. Whyteborn peered at the scene 
so intently that he did not notice 



the approach of William Dowles 
across the crowded Senior Com- 
mon Room. 

“Having tea?” Dowles said, 
questioning the obvious. 

“Yes, yes,” Whyteborn said 
distractedly. “I will only be a mo- 
ment. I’ve just had some Founder’s 
Port to round off my lunch and I 
am taking some tea to help it set- 
tle.” 

“You read the draft of our arti- 
cle that I wrote?”

“Yes, Helen brought it home 
with her after your dinner party.” 
In point of fact Professor Whyte- 
born suspected the events of the 
previous evening had extended far 
beyond the ordinary rituals of an 
Oxford evening dinner and this was 
one of the matters which had 
caused him to gaze so pensively at 
the garden quad, athletes and in- 
sects. 

“Any comments?” 

“A remark on the style,” 
Whytebom said. “The paper is lit- 
tered with the first person plural. 
We did this, we did that.” 

“There were two of us doing the 
experiment.” 

“Yes, but the ‘we’s’ in here be- 
gin to resemble a mob. I don’t like 
the form much, myself. Every 
scientific paper these days is full 
of them. I’ve always felt you 
shouldn’t use ‘we’ unless you’re 
an editor, a potentate or a man 
with a tapeworm.” 

“Well—” 

“But never mind, you are at no 
fault. You’re just a Reader in 
Physics at the moment — though I 
hope that will change quickly after 
publication of this paper — and 
haven’t had to wade through a 
thousand manuscripts written in 
the same style. Ah, and speaking 
of style. It could be a bit clearer.” 
“Really?” 

“I don’t see why everything can- 
not be explained in simple, clear, 
one-syllable words, without obfus- 
cating the issue.” 



The two men laughed quietly, 
so as not to disturb the Common, 
'and Whytebom went on. “There 
are a few places like that, yes, but 
generally I believe it’s okay. The 
reader can quickly see that we’ve 
done a good job of ruling out oth- 
er effects in our experiment, so 
our conclusion that we have de- 
tected tachyons is well supported. 
I was glad to see that you have in- 
cluded quite a lot of material on 
the correlation checks we did. We 
must be quite sure of this result.” 

“I think we’ve pretty well 
cleared things up, don’t you?” 
Dowles’ voice contained just the 
right blend of assertiveness and 
deference appropriate to a future 
son-in-law addressing the father of 
his fiancee. “Even the most ardent 
skeptic — ” 

“Don’t become optimistic. 
Tachyons are a whole new class of 
particles and they are going to 
turn theoretical physics on its ear. 
There will be opposition.” 

The younger man worriedly 
rubbed a thumbnail against his 
lower lip. “Surely we won’t be 
doubted too severely. The theore- 
ticians — Feinberg, Bilaniuk, Su- 
darshan — were the ones who put 
us on the track. They’ll stick by 
us.” 

W HYTEBORN nodded and 
went on sipping his tea. The 
Senior Common Room was emp- 
tying of the noon crowd, leaving 
blue curls of pipe smoke layered 



98 



IF 




in the air. “Yes, I believe they will. 
But there are going to be attacks 
on our work, be sure of it. I called 
a few people at Cambridge yester- 
day and they were most disinclined 
to accept our findings.” 

“Did they have any criticism of 
the way the experiment was set 
up?” Dowles said sharply. 

“No, none.” 

“Their objections can’t be seri- 
ous ones. Any cretin can see — ” 
Whyteborn shook his head, mar- 
veling at the innocence of youth. 
“You don’t see it. Tachyons are 
faster than light particles. That im- 
plies a whole string of new phe- 
nomena, not the least of which is 
the ability to send signals back in 
time. All the theoreticians agree 
on that point and I don’t fathom 
any reason not to go along with 
them.” 

“I know, I know,” Dowles said, 
biting into a scone. It tasted vague- 
ly of cinnamon. “Causal paradox- 
es. All that stuff about going back 
in time and shooting your grand- 
father. I’ll admit I don’t know how 
to resolve the paradoxes. That’s 
for the theoreticians to figure out. 
The fact of the matter is that tach- 
yons do exist — we’ve found them.” 
“Right on. And soon everyone 
will know about it.” 

“How soon? Not until we get 
this paper touched up, I’d think.” 
“There’s a rub about that. I’m 
afraid,” Whyteborn said, lowering 
his eyes. “It seems one of the fel- 
lows down at Cambridge trotted 



off to the journalists about this; I 
may have forgotten to ask him 
not to. At any rate, I received a 
call from a man at the Times this 
morning.” 

“Oh.” 

“Don’t worry, though, I put 
him off about it. We agreed to re- 
lease nothing until we had already 
informed our colleagues and I in- 
tend to stand fast by that. This 
news is so important I don’t want 
to overstep and get our names 
touted on the front page. That sort 
of thing will put off some of the 
people who are working on tachy- 
ons and do us no good.” 

“I’ll get right back to my office, 
then, and work on this paper some 
more.” 

“No, don’t. There’s something 
I would like you to help me with, 
if you have the time. No appoint- 
ment with Helen, I take it?” He 
tried a paternal smile which did 
not come off very well. Whyte- 
born had never felt himself to be 
the fatherly type and his experi- 
ments with the role had not 
worked out well in dealing with 
Dowles. The young man was his 
junior in the tachyon experiments 
and in the physics staff, and at the 
same time courted Helen Whyte- 
born. 

“No, we have nothing planned.” 
“Good. I spent this morning 
making changes in our apparatus. 
It was not particularly difficult to 
alter the experiment to register 
tachyon reception continuously, 

99 



3:02 P.M., OXFORD 




instead of getting detailed data on 
a few particles.” 

“Of what use is that?” 

“Well, the other evening it oc- 
curred to me that this paradox 
business is going to cause us a lot 
of trouble. The pencil pushers are 
going to worry about it. The first 
thing that will come to mind is 
that our experiments are wrong — 
that conveniently shoves the prob- 
lem out of sight for a while.” 

“Oho,” Dowles said, “you want 
to get the jump on them.” 

“Right. I want to look for mes- 
sages in the tachyon background 
we’ve detected.” 

“Just like a radio signal, you 
mean.” 

“Perhaps. I don’t know what 
form they would take. Since tach- 
yons are particles and radio is a 
wave they won’t carry signals the 
same way. We must simply look 
and see.” 

“I think that’s a good plan,” 
Dowles said, folding his arms so 
that his tweed jacket wrinkled in 
thick folds. “It will get the jump 
on the doubters.” 

Whyteborn smiled to himself, 
thinking he had handled the dis- 
cussion quite well. Appealing to 
his colleague’s competitive spirit 
was the quickest way to get him to 
working again after an already 
grueling series of experiments. 
They both harbored a simmering 
resentment against the sort of 
physicist who speculated in ideas 
like a stock broker, and tachyon 



theory was rife with them. It was 
fashionable to deplore further 
work in the field because the cau- 
sality paradox “clearly” ruled out 
their existence. To Whyteborn this 
was blowing a kernel of truth into 
a sort of intellectual puffed rice. 
The paradox showed that some- 
thing funny was going on but he 
had never felt that it should be 
used as a proof against tachyons. 
And it seemed as though he and 
Dowles had now proved their 
point. 

Whyteborn signed his tab and 
the two men left the Senior Com- 
mon Room, carrying with them 
the odors of steak and kidney pie, 
that day’s main course. 

T HEIR walk took them across 
the Euclidean perfection of the 
quad, through an ivy arch and 
down a small, cobbled lane. Ox- 
ford had bulged enormously over 
the last century but the colleges 
remained much the same. In fact, 
of late they had seemed to become 
even more encrusted with manner- 
isms and Tudor affectations, if 
that were possible. Undergradu- 
ates wore fashions in ruffles and 
lace, an Elizabethian touch — 
though not, Whyteborn imagined, 
out of historical interest, since 
bell-bottomed trousers played a 
role as well. 

All this quite suited the Profes- 
sor. He liked old things simply be- 
cause they were old and therefore 
tested. If in science he was an in- 



100 



IF 




novator, in his personal life he 
hungered for the remnants of the 
Edwardian era. 

Thus he felt particularly dis- 
comfited at the turn of events be- 
tween Dowles and his daughter, 
Helen. They seemed to have fallen 
in love, as far as he could tell. 
(Which was not very far, his hav- 
ing little experience in such mat- 
ters. His wife had died four years 
after Helen’s birth and had been, 
to Whyteborn, almost unnoticable 
even when alive.) 

He had vague feelings that he 
should have been more of a father 
to the girl and was making up for 
this now by trying to supervise her 
courtship very severely. But he was 
not experienced in that direction 
either and they seemed to be get- 
ting around him. He kept feeling 
that he was being outmaneuvered. 

For example, a few evenings ago 
they had all had dinner together 
and Helen had been going on 
about her current political hobby, 
Women’s Liberation League. This 
meant, as far as Whyteborn could 
tell, better pay and promotion for 
women, liberalized abortion laws 
and so on, all without their giving 
up having doors opened for them, 
being waited upon or being de- 
ferred to in mixed company. At 
that point Dowles leaned toward 
him and gave a gentle nudge with 
his elbow and said, “Helen rather 
enjoys standing up for her sex, I’ll 
vouch,” which sent him and Helen 
into storms of laughter. Whyte- 



born had been wondering ever 
since just how he had been meant 
to take the remark. 

He and Dowles passed by one of 
the liberal arts colleges, nodding 
to the fellows they knew socially. 
Whyteborn had never felt entirely 
comfortable with the people at Ox- 
ford who patronized arts, feeling 
that they did the same to everyone 
in the scientific colleges, and he 
was glad to reach the gates near 
his laboratory. The Skag College 
gatekeeper was tending to fines 
notices at the bulletin board and 
the Professor- took the opportunity 
to stop him. 

“There’s some chance men from 
the press might be by today,” he 
told the gatekeeper. “I would ap- 
preciate it if you’d see they don’t 
interrupt us in the labs.” 

The man nodded, stroking his 
rough chin. 

“Don’t put them off too strong- 
ly, though. Be-suave about it.” 

“Yessir,” the man said, “I’ll 
try. I ain’t half bloody suave, my- 
self.” 

“Uh, yes,” Whyteborn said, and 
the two men went into the labora- 
tories of Skag College. 

It took the better part of an 
hour to explain the changes in the 
apparatus to Dowles. Their earlier 
experiment, which discovered tach- 
yons, had depended upon a nuclear 
source, cesium. Modulation of the 
electric fields around the cesium 
nuclei stimulated tachyon emission 
and the uncharged tachyons were 



3:02 P.M., OXFORD 



101 




detected by the collisions they 
made with a sample some meters 
away. When a tachyon, moving 
much faster than the speed of light, 
struck one of the nuclei in the 
sample, the struck nucleus recoiled 
with an inordinately high momen- 
tum and created shock waves in 
the lattice of the sample. These 
shock waves were picked up and 
displayed on an oscilloscope. 

Now the nuclear source had 
been removed. Any tachyons pas- 
sing through the laboratory and 
striking the sample would also reg- 
ister on the oscilloscope. Such 
background tachyons had been 
found in the original experiment 
and had been ignored. Final proof 
that it was indeed tachyons which 
were being observed had depended 
upon correlations between the os- 
cilloscope and the electric fields 
around the cesium source, which 
the two men had varied. 

“I really don’t expect to get any- 
thing out of this,” Whyteborn said 
just before they began the new ex- 
periment. “It’s definitely a long 
shot. I don’t want to be like those 
chaps back in the thirties who were 
doing the nuclear bombardment 
work. For convenience they put 
their geiger counters on the same 
switch that turned off the beam of 
high energy particles they hit the 
samples with. If they hadn’t, they 
would have found spontaneous ra- 
dioactivity from the samples, after 
the beam was off. Missed a Nobel 
that way.” 



“Made them look rather like 
fools,” agreed Dowles. 

“Yes, and we don’t want to end 
up in the same class.” 

Whyteborn connected up the fi- 
nal wiring and they began monitor- 
ing. The oscilloscope trace danced 
and juggled, a random yellow line 
on a green background. The two 
men watched it in the leaden quiet 
of the laboratory. In a corner a 
roughing pump chugged laborious- 
ly and a liquid nitrogen bath that 
emersed the nuclear sample added 
an occasional snap as ice formed 
on its jacket. It was 2:47 PM. 



A T 3:02 the scope gave a sud- 
den scattering of pulses. A 
complex waveform wavered across 
the scale and each man looked at 
the other. 

“Strange,” said Dowles. 

“I don’t — wait. Look. It’s pul- 
sing at regular intervals. One, two, 
then nothing, four, then again 
nothing — it’s skipping some 
beats.” 

“Not ordinary background, I’d 
say.” 

“No. More like—” 

“A code,” Dowles finished. 
“Yes.” 

It was 3:06. 

“Take some of this down,” 
Whyteborn said. “I do not see 
what effect could be modulating 
the tachyons we have coming into 
the laboratory.” 

“Perhaps some process in the 



102 



IF 




sun,” Dowles said as he began to 
make notes. “A pulse, then a 
blank, another blank, and then 
pulse, pulse—” 

“No,” Whyteborn said, thinking 
aloud, “there is no such natural 
frequency related to the sun that I 
know of. Something else — ” 

He sat for a moment in silence. 
It was 3:1 1. 

“You remember,” he said, “I 
mentioned earlier that- there were 
paradoxes in the law of cause and 
effect implied by tachyons. Or so 
some think — ” His voice trailed 
off. 

Dowles went on with his notes. 
In a few moments he stopped. “It’s 
quiet right now,” he said. The 
wave form returned on the scope. 
Dowles sighed and began to copy 
once more. 

“By damn,” Whyteborn said. 
“It’s Morse. I remember it pretty 
well and this thing makes sense.” 

“It does?” 

“Well, I think. Rather outre , 
perhaps — ” 

“What does it say?” 

The Professor handed him the 
pad. PROTECT YOUR DAUGH- 
TER, it said. DOWLES HAS 
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND. 
CHECK IF YOU DON’T BE- 
LIEVE US. 

Dowles blinked for a moment. 
“It’s nonsense,” he said. 

“Of course, yes,” Whyteborn 
said, embarrassed. “I wonder how 
it—” 

“Do this next one,” Dowles said 



a little anxiously, and handed him 
the sheet. 

As Whyteborn was decoding it 
another message began to come 
in on the oscilloscope. Dowles 
copied. 

“DO NOT RELEASE TACH- 
YON RESULTS,” Whyteborn 
read after a moment. “IMPACT 
ON PHYSICAL SCIENCE 
WILL BE DELETERIOUS TO 
YOUR OWN WELL-BEING. 
REDUCTION IN SCIENCES 
APPROPRIATION. I say, you 
don’t suppose this could be some 
sort of joke?” 

“I’m taking it down just as it 
comes off the ’scope,” Dowles said 
sharply, “and I certainly would 
not have made up any such thing 
as that first one.” 

“I suppose not,” Whyteborn 
said. “It’s eerie, though. How 
could anyone — ” 

“Here’s the next,” Dowles said. 

The Professor did this one more 
quickly, since the practice was 
stimulating his memory of Morse. 
It said: 

SIGNAL OF 3:23 TRUE BUT 
MISLEADING. DOWLES IS

BUT THIS WAS ONLY TEM- 
PORARY ABERRATION. FAR 
WORSE CONSEQUENCES

LOWED TO CONTINUE HIS 
RELATIONSHIP WITH HEL- 
EN. 

“This is—” 

“Wait, there’s more,” said 



3:02 P.M., OXFORD 



103 




Dowles, who was scribbling in 
front of the oscilloscope. The mes- 
sage continued: 

OTHER MESSAGES COME 
FROM RENEGADE INTER- 
ESTS WHO WISH TO START 
CAUSAL ANOMALIES BY 
DEFLECTING WORLD LINES 
IN YOUR LOCALITY. IG- 
NORE THEM. WE— 

“Where’s the rest of it?” 

“Something happened right 
then. The signal shifted a bit and a 
stronger one came on. I’ve got 
some of it here.” 

OTHER KRAKEN WANT 
TO DISTURB YR PRESENT 
STATE OF MIND. CONT AS 
YOU WERE BUT DESTROY 
APPARATUS. IT IS THREAT 
TO MEGACOMPLEX OF UN- 
IULAR AXIS AS YOU SEE

KICKER IS IN THE AFTER— 

“My word,” Whyteborn said. 

“It’s still coming in,” Dowles 
said. 

“Can’t you get one of the tech- 
nicians from down the hall to do 
that? We must see what all this 
means.” 

“Yes, right. Be back in a min- 
ute.” Dowles fetched a PhD candi- 
date from the next laboratory and 
set him to copying. 

T HE two men sat around the 
table at the end of the room 
and decoded a few more of the sig- 
nals. 

“I am becoming more and more 



confused,” Dowles said at last, af- 
ter the PhD candidate had brought 
a fresh shelf of transcriptions. 
“What are these? Who is sending 
them?” 

“The form in itself is most cur- 
ious,” Whyteborn mused to him- 
self, ignoring the other for the mo- 
ment. “This one that begins OTH- 
ER KRAKEN seems right 
enough, but some of the words are 
not English that I recognize. The 
grammar is off, too.” 

“Not as bad as this,” Dowles 
said and held up a long sheet he 
had decoded. “ANUM REPAL- 
AT TRANSEQUIUM VERAT- 
AT, COS OCTAVIRUM WOL- 
EN, and on in that manner for 
more than a page.” 

“Here is one I think will interest 
you,” Whyteborn said. “It be- 
seeches me to kill you on the spot. 
HE IS POISONING YOUR 
MIND WITH CHAUVINISTIC 
IDEOLOGY. I will wager I know 
what sort of person sent that one.” 
“Yes,” said Dowles slowly. “I 
wonder why so many refer to me?” 
“I’ve been trying to work that 
out. The first question is why we 
are getting anything at all.” 

“Well, they’re coming from 
somewhere — ” 

“More than that. Som ewhen. I 
think the theorists were right about 
tachyons implying the ability to 
send signals into the past. Not into 
my own past, of course — I cannot 
send a telegram to myself last 
week, because that is on my world 



104 



IF 




line. But I could send one to some- 
one else.” 

“Then someone is sending us 
messages ? From the future?” 
“Precisely. The theory I have 
read says anyone on Earth could 
not send a telegram back to us 
more than about a quarter of a 
second into the past. But perhaps 
in the future a way will be found 
around that.” 

“Time machines?” 

“Time telegraphs, call them. It 
explains why we have never seen 
any time travelers, or gotten a 
message from the future.” 

“No one ever built a receiver 
before,” Dowles said slowly. “And 
now that we have — ” 

“We are getting it all. In the fu- 
ture they will know when the tach- 
yonic receiver was turned on. 
Someone is trying to signal us.” 
“But all these demands — ” 
Dowles slammed a fist down on 
the table and stood up. “Absurd.” 
Whyteborn made a tent of his 
fingers and smiled into it, his fa- 
vorite academic gesture. “Is it? 
This matter of a misdemeanor — ” 
“Uh,” said Dowles. Whyteborn 
thought he looked like a man who 
had just swallowed an absinthe 
frappe. 

“Right, nothing to be ashamed 
of, really. What is more interesting 
is the question of why it was men- 
tioned. It seems a minor point.” 
There was a small silence. “You 
aren’t going to let this influence 
Helen and me, are you?” 



“No, I don’t — wait! That must 
be it, surely. Those people in the 
future are trying to influence my 
judgment.” 

“What?” Dowles hesitated and 
then pawed among the sheets of 
paper. He fished out a half dozen 
and held them up. “There are a lot 
here that refer to Helen. You 
think — ” 

“Look, man, this is an impor- 
tant moment in history, if we’re 
right, no? What we do about the 
tachyon thing could have impor- 
tant implications. It could be, well, 
a crucial point.” 

Dowles paced back and forth, 
fretting. “Crucial or no, I don’t 
like them messing about in my af- 
fairs.” 

“But they are only trying to, 
you see. Perhaps they guessed you 
were made up on Helen but that I 
could still stop your marriage if I 
wanted. These messages are their 
way of influencing the time line to 
their benefit.” 

“Whose benefit?” 

“All those in the future. There 
must be — ” 

“There are an awful lot of 
them,’’ Dowles said. “Why so 
many? And look at this one. Not 
even English, or anything else I 
would judge. AMSNU QWEPO 
ALSEUD H 34ESUC, and so on. 
It’s gibberish.” 

“Or some other code. But I see 
your point. There are more than 
one would expect.” 

They both turned and looked at 



3:02 P.M., OXFORD 



105 




the PhD candidate, who was still 
copying intently from the oscillo- 
scope. A tall stack of paper at his 
elbow was already covered with 
notes. 

“Too many for the future — ” 
Dowles said. 

“For one future,” Whyteborn 
said suddenly. “I’m sure of it, 
Dowles, that is why we have so 
many. They will go right on com- 
ing in, too, because it is an infi- 
nitely divisible subset — ” 

“What is?” 

“The future! There must be an 
infinite number of possible ones 
but only one can actually happen, 
you see. But until I make some de- 
cision — I suppose the one about 
you and Helen — they all have 
equal chance of coming about.” 

“The future?” Dowles said won- 
deringly. “The future has some 
kind of ghost existence?” 

“Yes, right, but only one of 
them will survive. They’re all try- 
ing to influence us, to make their 
past come out right. Whatever I 
do will pick out one of the futures 
and destroy the rest.” 

Dowles thought for a moment. 
“We can test this,” he said at last, 
“if we keep track of the messages. 
There may be common threads 
among them that will tell us what 
they’re after.” 

“Perhaps,” said Whyteborn, 
thinking. 

“But we’ll need more people to 
tend the oscilloscope.” Dowles 
looked back at the PhD candi- 



date, who was visibly tiring. “I’ll 
go and find some help.” 

He left the laboratory quickly 
but Whyteborn was distracted and 
did not notice that he had gone. 
The Professor was mulling over 
the implications of what had hap- 
pened. It would make a hell of an 
article for the Royal Society, he 
was sure. 

He picked up one of the first 
messages. REDUCTION IN SCI- 
ENCES APPROPRIATION. 

How could discovery of tachyons 
make the government cut research 
funds? Still, Whyteborn thought, 
it might be a good idea to hold 
their article back for a few days, 
just in case. 

Then he found another paper, 
further along. ADVISE IMME- 
DIATE PUBLICATION EX- 
PERIMENTAL RESULTS.

TEAM WILL DETECT TACH- 
YONS WITHIN FOUR 
MONTHS. 

And another: CHECK YOUR 
RESULTS CAREFULLY.

SECTION CALCULATION 
MAY DISCREDIT YOUR 
WORK^ 

Whyteborn furrowed his brow. 
Which was right? 



D OWLES entered the labora- 
tory again and stopped by the 
PhD candidate to say something. 
In a moment the student got up 



106 



3:02 P.M., OXFORD 




and left, closing the door after 
him. 

“I don’t believe we should pub- 
lish any of this.” 

Whyteborn looked up. He had 
not noticed Dowles’ return and the 
voice took him by surprise. It had 
sounded curiously high pitched. 

“Why? Because of the mes- 
sages?” Whyteborn said. 

“Yes. There’s something in this 
we don’t understand and I think we 
should be cautious.” 

Whyteborn stared at Dowles. 
The man’s voice was oddly shrill, 
quite unlike his usual resonant 
baritone. And what was more — 

As he watched Dowles’ face, it 
flickered ever so slightly. 

Whyteborn felt a sudden chill 
down his scalp. The outlines of 
Dowles’ body wavered, as a distant 
image would on a hot summer 
day. And now that he noticed, the 
figure was not precisely like 
Dowles: the hair was thinner and 
the jawline had gone a little soft, 
giving the impression of an older 
man. 

“What’s happened?” Whyteborn 
said. 

“Happened?” the thin voice said. 
“Why—” 

“You’re not William Dowles.” 

“Oh.” The man seemed chest- 
fallen. “Well, we didn’t think it 
would work on — ” 

“You’re right, he is an impos- 
tor,” said another voice. Whyte- 
born turned to look behind him. 
Another Dowles was walking to- 



ward him from a corner of the 
laboratory, scowling. 

“An impostor?” 

“Yes,” the new man said, “I 
can’t imagine why. Some sort of 
practical joke, I would imagine. 
Come on now, get out,” he said, 

“Out? Why? So you can have a 
shot at him?” 

“I don’t know who you are,” 
said the second Dowles, “but I fail 
to see — ” 

“That stuff won’t wash,” said 
the other. “Look,” he said, turning 
to Whyteborn, “he’s going to try 
and persuade you to do something 
wrong. Don’t listen to him.” 

“Wait a moment,” Whyteborn 
said. He got up and walked around 
the table. Dowles #2 backed away 
but not quickly enough. Whyte- 
born reached out a hand toward 
the man. 

It went through. There was a 
prickling of warmth around 
Whyteborn’s wrist where it entered 
the second Dowles’ body, but noth- 
ing else out of the ordinary. His 
hand opened and closed on air. 

“What — ” was all Whyteborn 
could stammer. 

Dowles #1 said, “Well, he’s 
found out now. If you hadn’t been 
so pushy and come barging in I 
might have been able to cover.” 

“Cover? You? That facsimile 
of yours is wretched,” said Dowles 
#2. “Your eyebrows are too high 
and the posture is wrong and your 
voice is out of synchronization

H AVE you ever been to the 
Jungle sector of the Sentient 
planet? Many Terrans have. After 
the War, there were all sorts of 
package tours at reasonable rates 
and the sector was still wild 
enough to offer some exotic sight- 
seeing. The giant plants are eye- 
catching purples, reds and oranges. 
The fauna are something, too. Par- 
ticularly the Quintopods. 

I know a lot about the Quinto- 
pods. Back on Terra, is a medical 
monograph I wrote on their anato- 
my and neurophysiology. As the 
name implies, they have five ap- 
pendages, all symmetrically ar- 
ranged around a disc-shaped body. 
The malformed head holds a tan- 
gled knot of cerebellar nerves, two 
compound eyes and a slash for a 
mouth. I’ve argued that the head 
is actually a specialized sixth limb, 
but none of the other so-called au- 
thorities agree with me. 

The Quinto body is flexible, 
muscular and capable of amazing 
adaptations. They are great build- 
ers and the silicon towers of the 
jungle sector are highlighted in the 
tourist guides. They are reason- 
ably intelligent, not up to the Sen- 
tients or even to Terrans, but well 
beyond the anthropoids. 

They communicate by opening 
that scar of a mouth and thrusting 
out a slender vibrating appendage. 
The sounds are strange and unlike 
any humanoid speech I’ve ever 
heard. Some Terrans find these 
sounds exotic, dissonant, but I’ve 



always found them hauntingly mu- 
sical. I still pride myself on my 
ability to interpret these vibra- 
tions, a job I worked at for many 
long and painful years. There 
aren’t too many around who can 
understand the Quintopods. 

They are proud creatures, con- 
scious of their roles as males and 
females. The two sexes do not 
mingle socially except for pro- 
creative purposes. It is only the 
aged or infirm male who finds 
himself working alongside the 
women at the menial tasks. For 
many years the dominant Sentient 
culture nurtured the Quintopod 
communities to preserve one of 
the cherished subspecies of the 
planet. 



FTER the Sentient War I 
came in with the occupying 
Terran forces as medical officer in 
the Jungle sector. The war had 
been bloody but short. Some mis- 
directed missiles had wiped out 
eighty percent of the Quintopods, 
so special measures were taken to 
assist the survivors. Our troops 
were bored stiff and there was little 
to divert them, considering the 
prudish attitudes of the Sentients 
toward prostitution. But a couple 
of entrepreneurs from the Terran 
States were licensed to come into 
the sector and they stirred things 
up. 

One of them, an aggressive fel- 
low named Matt Handman, was a 




THE QUINTOPODS

showman and an active operator. 
He set up a gambling and sex pal- 
ace under Occupation license. He 
was also the first one to see what 
great potential the Quintopods 
had in the ancient sport of boxing. 

Boxing was still an active sport 
back on Terra and very popular. 
And the sight of a Quintopod wav- 
ing three boxing gloves was 
enough to excite any observer. 
Our troops loved it. The Quinto- 
pods were fine athletes and were 
readily trained to the sport. The 
high prestige of the gladiator was 
an irresistible inducement to them. 
I was against allowing them to 
fight. I’ve always considered the 
sport an abomination and I knew 
that, in spite of their tough skins, a 
tear in the cerebellar mantle x>f 
the Quintps could mean instant 
death. 

Within a year’s time a dozen 
Quintos had fought themselves to 
top boxing ratings. The Sentients 
were angry and presented a series 
of diplomatic protests decrying the 
“barbarization” of the Quintos. 
These notes were politely ac- 
cepted, pushed slowly through our 
Army bureaucracy and allowed to 
fade from sight. 

Huge crowds of Terran soldiers 
came to every bout, wagering hun- 
dreds of thousands of credits. I 
never went, although my baser in- 
stincts sometimes nagged at me. 
But I had too much affection for 
the Quintos and I didn’t want to 
risk seeing a fatality. Still, I would 



have liked to see Pinwheel in ac- 
tion. 

Pinwheel was champion of the 
Quintopods. I was told that he was 
a natural showman and the dar- 
ling of our troops. Instead of the 
usual three boxing gloves he wore 
five, balancing himself precarious- 
ly on two of the eight-ounce 
gloves. Although he was a very 
skillful boxer, he would sometimes 
forget finesse and slug fiercely, 
ready to take three or four blows 
just to get in one powerful hook. 
And the coup de grace would 
come in a rolling frenzy of leather 
as he spun about in an unstoppable 
blur of rotary motion. 

Matt Handman managed Pin- 
wheel and I detested him for that, 
too. He was making a fortune in 
credits out of the brutal Quinto 
fights and to me he was the low- 
est form of parasite. Periodically 
I submitted written protests to the 
commanding general. But I was 
ignored and there was nothing else 
I could do. Nothing, that is, until 
the first Quinto fatality took place. 

The Quinto hadn’t been badly 
beaten. He suffered a cerebellar 
tear after a seemingly light jab to 
the head and he died in the ring. 
It was my chance to intervene and 
I grabbed it. I pressured the Oc- 
cupation Command into letting 
me take ultrasonograms of each 
fighter’s brain. There was a good 
deal of stalling and some buck- 
passing but I was finally given per- 
mission to proceed.

IF 




The Quintos showed up for the 
physical reluctantly since their 
managers were openly hostile to 
my plan. But when I threatened to 
revoke the licenses of delinquents, 
they came right in. Two of the 
Quintos were clearly victims of a 
slight mantle tear and their licen- 
ses were immediately revoked/ Ev- 
eryone else seemed all right except 
for one doubtful ultrasonogram. 
Pinwheel was the question mark, 
although I was convinced by study- 
ing his walking motions that there 
were subtle indications of neuro- 
logical damage. I called in his 
manager,* Matt Handman, and 
told him of my findings. 

“I don’t believe you,” he said 
vehemently. “Pinwheel has never 
looked better in his bouts. I know 
that you hate me and I think you’d 
do anything to put me out of busi- 
ness.” 

“I might,” I admitted. “But I’m 
trying to be objective about Pin- 
wheel’s health. I think he’s in grave 
danger of being killed. I haven’t 
enough medical proof formally to 
revoke his license, so I’m asking 
you to get him to retire.” 

Handman stared at me as 
though I were insane and then, his 
arm around Pinwheel, he escorted 
the Quinto out of my office. I 
turned to Seva Tcana, Sentient 
medical observer who was per- 
mitted an occasional visit to my 
office by sufferance of the Ter- 
ran High Command. Like most 
Sentients, he was formally correct 



but at the same time very hard to 
know. 

“Handman is a toad,” I said 
angrily. “He’d kill his own moth- 
er for a thousand credits.” 

“He might,” said Seva. “Many 
Terrans are money-hungry ani- 
mals.” 

He didn’t smile but I assumed 
he was joking. 

“To him,” I said, “a fighter is a 
prize steer that you sell to the 
butcher.” 

Seva seemed disturbed by my 
remarks. 

“You make me uncomfort- 
able,” he said finally. “I don’t like 
to hear you disparage one of your 
own people.” 

I understood his reaction. The 
Army Guide to the Sentient planet 
had stressed their fierce intra-cul- 
tural loyalties. 

“I’m sorry,” I said. But I really 
wasn’t. 



A SONG sprang up among the 
Sentients, spontaneously it 
seemed. Translated into Terran 
and forgetting the poetic nuances, 
the lines ran roughly as follows: 

Oh the Terrans are a strange but 
verile race, 

In the War they swept along 
with martial pace. 

And in peace they love a fight 
See them gather every night 
Just to see the Quintos battered 
in the face. 



THEQUINTOPODS

The chorus, to a very catchy tune, 
went: 

Here s to Terran heroes, 

Here’s to all of those. 

Who quite fearlessly 

Watch others smashed by blows. 

This song spread like wildfire 
through the Sentient planet and 
whenever a Terran soldier ap- 
peared in even the tiniest hamlet 
someone was certain to hum the 
chorus. 

General Hinsley, head of the 
Occupation Command and hero of 
the War, was furious. A staff 
meeting was called at Command 
HQ at which I was ordered to be 
present. Matt Handman was there, 
too. The general sat at the head of 
a long, ornately carved confer- 
ence table, knitting his brows, be- 
fore he spoke. 

“I’m fond of boxing. It’s a man- 
ly sport and it builds the body and 
mind. But maybe using Quintos is 
wrong. It probably weakens the 
moral fiber of our boys to watch 
these freaks dance around in a 
ring. The doctor here keeps send- 
ing me medical reports that say 
they’ll kill each other and that 
could provoke the Sentients even 
more.” 

He shuffled the papers on his 
desk and turned to look directly 
at me. His disgust was apparent, 
although he tried to conceal it. I 
nodded my agreement. Then he 
turned to Handman. I wondered 



what sort of rebuttal the promo- 
ter could offer and I soon found 
out. He spoke quickly but he 
seemed to have prepared his argu- 
ments very carefully. 

“I agree with the general,’’ he 
began. “I’ve been involved in box- 
ing for many years back on Terra 
and there just is no greater sport. 
Two men go out into that ring 
alone and it’s one man’s skill and 
guts against another’s. In an era 
when most of everything is done 
by some kind of machine there’s 
something inspiring to see what 
men alone can do with their own 
brains and muscle.’’ 

The general seemed rapt. 

“And,’’ continued Handman, 
“those people who have criticized 
my Quinto fights have a point. 
There may be something primitive 
about seeing two Quintos box. But 
there’s more. They’re graceful, 
they’re skillful and nobody really 
gets hurt. And it does wonders for 
the morale of our boys. These 
guys are tremendous distances 
from home, they’re lonely, they’re 
bored. They risked their lives for 
Terra. Don’t we owe them a little 
entertainment?” 

I scowled and looked at my fin- 
gers. 

“The doctor says the Quintos 
might get killed. So far there’s 
only been one death and that’s 
controversial. I’ve seen a medical 
report that says the Quinto died 
of a viral infection. But I’m not a 
doctor. Maybe we do need stricter 



112 



IF 




exams before each fight. That’s 
okay with me. But let’s not take it 
out on our boys. And don’t forget 
that a lot of tax money comes 
from the gate receipts — they help 
finance Occupation expenses.” 

The general nodded. 

“But what about that song?” he 
said. 

“Let’s talk about that song,” 
said Handman. “I’m no military 
man. I trust the general here in 
whatever he wants to do. As an 
ordinary civilian I resent that song. 
I think the Sentients are trying to 
demean our manhood. But we 
can’t cut and run. I want to pro- 
pose a way that will show them 
what kind of people we are. I’m 
prepared to bring in Sam Porter, 
the heavyweight champion of Ter- 
ra, to fight the Quintopod champ, 
Pinwheel; Let’s show the kind of 
stuff we’re made of. Once and for 
all, we’ll stop those remarks about 
how we just watch and can’t do. In 
conclusion, I’m prepared to donate 
half of the receipts from this bout 
to the Occupation Recreational 
Fund.” 

He sat down abruptly. 

The general clearly seemed im- 
pressed by Handman’s arguments. 
He adjourned the meeting without 
coming to an immediate decision 
— but the following week he for- 
mally announced the match be- 
tween Sam Porter and Pin wheel. It 
caused great excitement among 
our troops and the betting rose to 
fever pitch. 



P INWHEEL went into a strenu- 
ous training program in prepa- 
ration for the Championship bout. 
Although I had never seen him 
fight, I decided to exercise my 
right as medical officer and visit 
his camp. A regulation ring was 
set up in three cleared jungle acres 
with stands that seated perhaps fif- 
ty to one hundred spectators. I 
took a seat in one of the last rows 
and waited for the day’s exhibi- 
tion to begin. 

Pinwheel came out wearing a 
protective headgear, but when he 
saw me in the back row he turned 
to Matt Handman and pointed. 
Handman smiled and very delib- 
erately removed Pinwheel’s head- 
gear and tossed it to one side. I 
pretended to be unmoved at this 
provocation but inside I was boil- 
ing. 

The opening round of the ex- 
hibition took place in almost total 
silence. It had a bizarre kind of 
fascination for me in spite of my 
revulsion at the barbaric display. 
Pinwheel was truly a master of the 
art and he had changed his tactics 
just to show me, I suppose. In- 
stead of taking three blows to one 
as I had been told he usually did, 
he wove his head about, slipping 
all of the three-gloved blows that 
shot toward his head, parrying the 
others with a kind of easy disdain. 
All through the round he threw but 
an occasional glove as though con- 
tent simply to feel out his sparring 
partner. I rubbed my chin in won- 



THE QUINTOPODS 



113 




der. Pinwheel’s moves were cer- 
tainly not those of a Quinto with 
damaged brain structure. 

The round ended and after a 
short rest the exhibition resumed. 
Now he opened up with the fa- 
mous Pinwheel spin, and a blurred 
sequence of heavy blows rained on 
his partner, staggering him. Just 
as he fell to the canvas, he threw 
a wild hook that caught Pinwheel 
in midflight, squarely on the head. 
He went down as though poleaxed 
but immediately pulled himself 
shakily erect. Handman quickly 
called time. 

I was out of my seat instantly 
and down to the ring to examine 
both Quintos. Pinwheel was walk- 
ing about to show hpw fine he felt 
but I insisted on having him car- 
ried to his dressing room where I 
went through a rudimentary neu- 
rological examination. The evi- 
dence was clear. 

“The mantle is torn,” I said 
tersely. 

Matt Handman turned white 
through his Sector tan and he said 
nothing. 1 turned to examine Pin- 
wheel’s opponent and was con- 
scious of Matt Handman, still 
standing at my side, staring at me. 

“Bring Pinwheel to my office 
tomorrow,” 1 said. “I want to give 
him a more thorough workup.” 

T HE second examination con- 
firmed what 1 had suspected. 
The beginnings of mantle tear had 
taken place and literally any kind 



of blow or jar might kill Pinwheel. 

I quietly impressed this fact on 
Matt Handman but his face was 
impassive and he showed no emo- 
tional response. Still, I thought I 
had frightened him until the fol- 
lowing day when I received a letter 
typed on Clerk of the Sector form, 
requesting a formal hearing on my 
decision to revoke Pinwheel’s li- 
cense. 

At Handman’s request the hear- 
ing was kept private. I also agreed 
to allow Pinwheel to present his 
own appeal, although 1 couldn’t 
see what difference it could make 
in my decision. Nevertheless, al- 
though I could interpret Quinto 
speech with great fluency, I de- 
layed the proceedings by calling 
for an official army interpreter. 

The Quinto, Pinwheel, came 
forward and stood quietly before 
my desk. His body was beautifully 
formed and without a single mark 
other than a freshly healed cut 
across his head. To the casual ob- 
server he seemed to be in perfect 
condition. When the interpreter 
took his place at the Quinto’s side, 
Pinwheel began. His language was 
simple and as nearly as I can re- 
member, he said: 

I wish to be permitted to fight. I 
know the danger and / am willing 
to face it. I have worked hard to 
master my craft as boxer. 1 am 
respected by my people for my 
strength and skill. Your soldiers 
admire me, too, and cheer my 
victories. If you turn me away 



114 



IF 




you will take away my strength , 
my self-respect. Perhaps I am in 
danger of dying from the slightest 
blow. / will risk it. But if you send 
me back to the women you will 
make me something less than a 
dead man. 

He stepped back and waited for 
my answer. For the moment I had 
none. My assurance had evapo- 
rated at his words and the decision 
which had seemed so obvious was 
now uncertain. Was I invading a 
private right, the right to choose 
one’s own way to die? But if that 
right involved the choice of -sui- 
cide, by Terran standards it was 
illegal, no matter what its mean- 
ing in the Quinto culture. If Pin- 
wheel were to die in the ring it 
would be because / had permitted 
it to happen. 

I rose to my feet. 

“The appeal is rejected,” I said. 
“As medical officer of this Sector, 
I hereby reaffirm my decision to 
revoke the boxing license of the 
Quintopod known as Pinwheel. Of 
course you can appeal to the com- 
manding general.” 

It was well known that General 
Hinsley, as a matter of policy, had 
never overruled lower command 
decisions of a minor nature. 

Pinwheel seemed stunned. He 
swayed, almost stumbled, uncer- 
tain of what to do or where to go. 
Matt Handman came quickly to 
his side and led him out of my of- 
fice. I gathered up all the papers 
concerning the case and placed 



them into a confidential inter-of- 
fice envelope. The matter was now 
in General Hinsley’s hands. 

I WAS asked to be present at the 
appeal, an unusual and prece- 
dent-breaking step. I found myself 
alone with the general and Matt 
Handman. We sat silently for 
many minutes while the general 
went through the record, page by 
page. Finally he closed the folder, 
removed his metal-rimmed glasses 
and addressed himself to me. 

“You’re absolutely certain of 
the tear?” 

“Absolutely.” 

The general sighed. 

“There are many reasons why 
this bout should be held. But most 
important to me is the one with 
political and psychological over- 
tones. The Sentient population is 
becoming restive under the Occu- 
pation. So far there has been no 
armed outbreak, merely a few in- 
cidents in isolated places. Then 
there’s that song. A humiliation of 
the Terran forces might spark off 
active resistance. For that reason, 
and others, I would like to see this 
bout held.” 

“I can’t sanction it,” I said. 

The general didn’t seem to hear 
me. 

“Suppose there is a mantle 
tear,” he said. “It might offer cer- 
tain advantages to us. Although 
it’s inconceivable that Sam Porter 
could lose, insurance is always 
welcome. And think what an enor- 



THE QUINTOPODS 



115 




mous propaganda risk we would 
be taking if by some freak of 
chance Sam Porter lost to the 
Quinto?” 

For some time there had been 
latrine gossip concerning the gen- 
eral’s political ambitions. It was 
said that he wanted to run for the 
Secretaryship of the Solar Direc- 
torate, Terra’s highest office. - I 
could see that he wanted to take 
no chances of anything marring 
his long-range plans. 

“I’m sorry, sir,” I said. “As a 
medical man I can’t in true con- 
science go along with you. Why 
not substitute another Quinto for 
Pinwheel?’’ 

Matt Handman shook his head. 

“We can’t do that,’’ he said. 
“No other Quinto is in his class. 
They’d accuse us of fixing the re- 
sult by using an inferior Quinto.’’ 

“They might say that anyway,’’ 
I said. “Word may have gotten 
out about Pinwheel’s suspension.’’ 

“Mr. Handman assures me that 
no one has been told by him or 
Pinwheel,’’ said the general. “And 
your hearing was private and held 
under military security procedure. 
I agree with Handman. We’ve got 
to use Pinwheel.” 

I sat there in turmoil. My med- 
ical oath had been very meaning- 
ful to me and still was. I was re- 
luctant to break it but I might 
bend it a little. 

“Very well,” I said bitterly. 
“I’ll rescind my ban. Pinwheel may 
fight Porter.” 



The general leaned toward me. 

“That’s not enough,” he said 
softly. “I want you to issue a med- 
ical statement certifying that Pin- 
wheel is in perfect fighting trim. If 
you refuse — I will have the state- 
ment drawn up and issued over 
your name. If you make me do 
that I’ll not only break you but 
I’ll see that your medical license is 
revoked.” 

I tried to speak but my voice 
had suddenly gone hoarse and low. 
I struggled with my vocal chords 
and the words finally emerged. 

“I’ll do it,” I said. 

W HEN I came into my office, 
Seva Tcana was waiting to 
see me. 

“There are whispers about that 
Pinwheel has been hurt,” he said. 
“Are they true?” 

“I thought so on my first ex- 
amination,” I said. “But it was 
only an artifact of the ultrasono- 
graphic test. I’ve just been to see 
General Hinsley and informed him 
of my findings. I plan to issue a 
medical statement giving Pinwheel 
a clear bill of health.” 

“I see,” said Seva. 

“Do you believe me?” I said 
abruptly. 

He shrugged. 

“Does it matter?” 

I was tired, angry, frustrated 
and I lost a rather tenuous grip on 
my self-control. 

“It could matter,” I said sharp- 
ly. “If Pinwheel were really in- 



IF 



116 




jured, it would be in the interest of 
your people if he never made it to 
the ring. If he has to die, at least 
it ought to be for a worthwhile 
cause.” I caught myself. “That’s 
all a theoretical supposition,” I 
said. 

Seva rose te his feet. 

“I look forward to your new 
medical statement,” he said. He 
bowed and left. 



1 SPENT the afternoon and most 
of the night writing and rewrit- 
ing my medical report until it 
seemed to reach just the proper 
language and plausibility. I left it 
on my secretary’s desk to be typed 
and printed up. 

I slept all morning and after- 
noon. When I awoke I learned of 
Pinwheel’s sudden and tragic 
death. The reports were conflict- 
ing. The first talked about an ac- 
cidental slip and fall while doing 
roadwork. The second, with sinis- 
ter overtones, hinted at an un- 
known Sentient striking the Quin- 
to a blow on the head. No wit- 
nesses were to be found, although 
the Terran command was launch- 
ing an investigation. 

I stared at my report, neatly 
typed, the sentences and para- 



graphs set in easy-to-read military 
form. It was all ridiculous now. I 
would be the laughing stock of the 
Sentient community if it were is- 
sued. As for the general, he would 
have no recourse but to suspend 
all bouts from now on. The cham- 
pionship bout with Porter had be- 
come a vanished dream. 

As I sat there, musing, Seva 
Tcana came in to my office. I 
put down my report and looked at 
him but he returned my gaze with- 
out blinking. 

“Was Pinwheel’s death an acci- 
dent?” I asked. 

“Do you really expect me to an- 
swer that?” he said. 

No, I thought. No matter how 
strongly a Sentient feels about a 
particular issue, he would never 
help an outside culture against his 
own people the way I did last 
night. 

I felt a slight tightening in my 
stomach and the roof of my 
mouth had suddenly gone dry. I 
was God knows how many mil- 
lions of miles away from home 
and friends and suddenly, com- 
pletely alone. I thought for many 
long moments before I framed a 
reply to Seva. He listened to my 
halting remarks but didn’t seem to 
care what they were. •

JUPITER 

Position in Solar System: Jupiter 
is the fifth planet from the sun. 
370 million miles from earth, this 
planet is in that area of the sys- 
tem popularly referred to as “deep 
space.” Jupiter is named after the 
chief god in Roman mythology 
and is the largest member of the 
sun’s family. 

Physical Characteristics: Jupiter is 
86,800 miles in diameter. It re- 
volves around the sun once every 
12 (Earth) years. Approximately 
318 times the size of Earth, Jupi- 
ter’s gravitational pull is 2 Vi times 
that of our own planet (suggested 
classroom exercise for elementary 
grades: each child should weigh 
himself on the Health Office scales 
and then compute how much he/ 
she would weigh on the planet Ju- 
piter). 

Jupiter has twelve moons. Four 
of them (Europa, Ganymede, Cal- 
listo, Io) are very large, almost 
the size of Earth. 

Jupiter’s atmosphere is believed 
to extend upward a thousand miles 
or more from the surface of the 
planet, with some variance at the 
poles. The atmosphere is com- 
posed of large quantities of meth- 
ane, ammonia (crystals), some 
hydrogen and lesser amounts of 



other gases. It is believed that the 
density of the atmosphere near' 
the surface of the planet approach- 
es that of a liquid. This atmo- 
sphere would not support any life 
form that we know of. 

Jupiter has nine temperature 
zones. Seen through a telescope, 
these zones appear as cloud belts 
of vaguely differentiated color 
bands. These cloud belts move 
across the surface of the planet 
at different rates of speed. This 
movement may be due to electron 
ionization within the atmosphere 
of the planet. 

A striking feature of this planet 
is the dark red area of gas that 
moves across the surface at ex- 
tremely high rates of speed. This 
“spot” (large as the Earth) is be- 
lieved to be a dense group of gases 
moving beneath the surface of the 
outer atmosphere. 

Jupiter does not conform to ex- 
pected patterns of planetary radio 
wave emanations. This phenome- 
non is, as yet, unexplained.

sults of twenty-two unmanned

TOP SECRET TOP SECRET 

Mission Book Insert 194.37 (Sup- 
plemental). Excerpts from a brief- 
ing given by Dr. Roger LaTrane 
to flight and support personnel of 
Odyssey Two. 

Subject: Radio wave patterns of 
the planet Jupiter. 



There is no need for me to em- 
phasize to you the importance of 
this mission, our second attempt 
to send men into deep space. The 
failure of Odyssey One is past his- 
tory and I’m sure you are wonder- 
ing why we choose to launch a sec- 
ond mission when we know virtual- 
ly nothing about the disappearance 
of the first. I think the reason will 
become clear to you as my talk 
progresses. In the meantime, I 
would like to apologize on behalf 
of the directors for not making 
our intentions known at an earlier 
date. Quite frankly, there was a 
good deal of indecision. Also, 
there were certain public relations 
factors which had to be taken into 
account. 

As far as our knowledge is con- 
cerned, Jupiter is the “black 
sheep” of the solar system. We 
know scarcely more about the 
planet today than we did a hun- 
dred and fifty years ago. It was 
this dearth of information that 
originally prompted us to launch 
Odyssey One. At that time we had 
reason to assume that the diffi- 
culties of the longer flight could 
be computed by the K factor and 
anticipated. We were wrong and 
we paid for our mistake with the 
lives of seven men. 

After the failure of that mis- 
sion the decision was made that we 
would not make another attempt 
to reach Jupiter until we had 
somehow gained more information 
about surface and atmospheric

conditions that might have caused 
the failure of the first mission. 
Unfortunately that information 
has not been forthcoming. Odys- 
sey Two bears the same burden of 
risk as Odyssey One, with the pos- 
sible exceptions of minute im- 
provements in the exploration ve- 
hicles and the knowledge that un- 
known danger does most definitely 
exist. 

Every planet, including the 
Earth, emits a distinct pattern of 
radio waves. Each pattern is 
unique and serves to identify a 
planet, much in the same way as a 
fingerprint will identify a man. 
The pattern of these waves is de- 
pendent upon the body’s mass, 
density, composition, atmospheric 
conditions, surface materials and 
so on. The frequency distributions 
of these materials are constant and 
reliable, enabling us to determine 
the physical characteristics of 
celestial bodies by measuring the 
quality of the radio waves emitted 
from them. 

Jupiter is the one planet in our 
system that does not conform, at 
least in theory. Its pattern of radio 
waves is not what visual observa- 
tion and spectrography tell us it 
should be. A prime objective of 
Odyssey One was to discover the 
cause of this discrepancy. 

Within the past year the pattern 
of Jupiter’s signals has changed 
dramatically. Our scientists have 
observed the waves doubling in 
intensity. It is an erratic occur- 



rence, lasting only a few milli- 
seconds at a time. However, there 
is no explanation for this phenom- 
enon. Nothing like it has ever been 
observed, except in the obvious 
case of a super nova. 

Naturally, we have no way of 
knowing whether this new phenom- 
enon has any connection with the 
disappearance of Odyssey One. 
Quite frankly, we doubt ’it. There 
seems no way the crew could 
have survived this long. Certainly, 
not anywhere near the planet’s sur- 
face. Also, it is inconceivable that 
Odyssey One could have caused 
the effect observed here on Earth. 

We have reached and colonized 
Mars, Venus and the twilight zone 
of Mercury. Development of those 
planets will consume the energies 
of our scientists for decades. In 
other words, our program of 
manned space exploration has 
ground to a standstill. There is the 
ever-present danger of stagnation. 
We have always believed that we 
have the skills and technology to 
penetrate deep space. We must do 
so if we hope someday to reach the 
stars. A new mystery may be the 
key to an old one. In any case, we 
have decided to try one more time. 
In a very real sense, the dreams 
and aspirations of all men are rid- 
ing with you. God speed.

T HE pain clung to him, em- 
bracing him in its sweaty arms

IF 




throughout the long journey from 
nothing to now. The transition 
from a state of coma to conscious- 
ness was a universe of tortured 
nerve ends and quivering muscles. 

Major Eric Bentzel blinked in 
the darkness and tested his stiff 
muscles against the leather straps 
and cushions that held him. Bits 
and pieces of memory floated into 
the vacuum in his mind to drift 
like wreckage in a tidal pool. 
Then awareness came, making him 
whole once again. 

Eric loosened the restraining 
straps and stretched his arms and 
legs, allowing himself a long, sat- 
isfied grunt of pleasure. He felt a 
sudden kinship with the men of 
Odyssey One; Claude Philmore, 
his counterpart on that first mis- 
sion, had undoubtedly gotten this 
far and experienced these same 
sensations. 

Satisfied that his circulation had 
returned to normal, Eric sat up 
and tested his gravity shoes against 
the porous strips lining the floor 
of the ship. He pushed the light- 
control lever above his head and 
his cubicle was bathed in the soft 
yellow glow of Safe Psyche illu- 
mination. Finally he detached 
from his body the needles and 
plastic tubes that had fed him 
through the long night and stood 
up. 

He waited a few moihents for 
his body to adjust to an upright 
stance, then pressed another lever 
and stepped out of his cubicle into 



what was the main body of the 
ship. 

He was the first to undergo 
transition and was quite alone in 
the huge expanse of gleaming met- 
al. The opening of his cubicle door 
had activated the interior lighting 
of the ship. At the far end of the 
chamber a multi-colored panel 
glittered in a bath of blue light. 
The panel housed the recording in- 
struments and manual controls, 
the computers and other appara- 
tus which had monitored the ship 
and crew for the past two years 
and which would have to be reset 
for the return journey to the 
Earth. On each side of the panel 
was a large green disc, the metal 
shielding for the quartz-alloy por- 
tal telescopes. When exposed, each 
optical device afforded the viewer 
a one hundred and eighty degree 
panorama of space outside the 
ship. 

The rest of the huge chamber 
was bare. The remainder of the in- 
struments were buried beneath the 
floor, ready to whir upwards at 
the touch of appropriate levers. 
The ship was designed to provide 
the maximum amount of work 
and living space. 

A touch of his hand exposed the 
portal telescopes and Eric found 
himself staring into the black, 
star-spotted maw of the void; hyp- 
notic, beautiful and ever so deadly. 
A mass of space matter drifted a 
few hundred miles a>vay, an island 
in an ocean of ink. 



THE SEVENTH MAN 



123 




He closed the portals and 
brought up the command table. 
He had no way of knowing how 
long before the others would join 
him. In the meantime he could do 
little but begin the laborious pro- 
cess of checking and rechecking 
the ship's systems. 

A cursory examination of the 
time-lapse tapes indicated to him 
that the ship would reach destina- 
tion within a week. She would au- 
tomatically inject herself into or- 
bit around Jupiter and then wait 
with the patience of a machine for 
her human cargo to awake from 
its slumber and, with that grand 
presumptuousness that is the hu- 
man spirit, resume command of 
her atomic soul. 

Even now the object of their 
voyage would be clearly visible in 
the portal telescopes, should he set 
them at the proper viewing angle. 
But he would wait; the first sight 
of Jupiter belonged to all of them 
together. 

Together they would gaze upon 
the face of a killer planet that had 
destroyed all communication and 
then proceeded to swallow up an 
entire ship as well as a crew 
trained to meet any kind of con- 
ceivable emergency. 

Conceivable emergency? 

He wondered what answers to 
what questions Philmore had 
known before he died. Had the as- 
sistant commander of Odyssey 
One seen the force that killed 
him? Had he been able to antici- 

124 



pate it even for an instant? If not, 
what possible chance did the men 
of Odyssey Two have of escaping 
the same fate? 

Eric could think of no useful 
purpose served by dwelling on the 
fate of the first mission. He re- 
turned to the task of electronically 
scanning the remainder of the 
computer tapes. He worked slow- 
ly, knowing the importance of 
finding tasks to fill the dangerous, 
yawning pockets of time. Fre- 
quently he would open his eyes to 
discover that he had been sleeping. 



T HE men stood and stared in 
silence. Jupiter appeared as a 
monstrous, suppurating wound, 
erupting from the black enamel 
hide of the universe. The white, 
rock-encrusted spheres that were 
Jupiter’s moons were maggots, 
scurrying about the gaseous behe- 
moth, waiting to enter the swirling 
red-orange pus of the wound. 

Raines was the first to turn 
away. He moved to the command 
table, studied the instruments. 

“Major Bentzel,” Raines said, 
“would you check the transmis- 
sion tapes again, please?’’ 

Eric moved quickly to the com- 
puter console and, for the fifth 
time since the ship had gone into 
orbit, punched out the communi- 
cations index. His fingers moved 
with a muscular memory of their 
own. He could feel the cold, al- 
mond eyes of Kyoto Chiang bor- 
ing into his back. There was a me- 

IF 




tallic taste in his mouth that he 
would have characterized, before 
his psychiatric realignment, as 
fear. 

“Negative,” Eric said quietly. 
“Our signal is still being transmit- 
ted but there is no indication that 
it is being received. We aren’t re- 
ceiving anything at all. The com- 
puter gives no indication of 
malfunction.” 

Raines nodded, absently tugging 
at his ear. The commander was a 
quiet man, almost to the point of 
shyness. But he showed no sign of 
indecision or even anxiety. 

“Lieutenant?” 

“I’ve tried voice contact,” Jim 
Rhodes announced. “The results 
were negative. I have no explana- 
tion. We get nothing, not even 
static.” 

“So,” Raines announced, 
scratching his shoulder, “it seems 
that we’re on our own. Any sug- 
gestions?” 

The faint clicking of the elapsed- 
time monitor was the only sound 
in the room. Eric’s gaze swept the 
dials of the console, searching for 
some clue to the breakdown in 
communications between the ship 
and Earth. It was a half-hearted 
effort, more habit than any belief 
that the answer lay in the tens of 
thousands of miles of wiring with- 
in the computer and transmission 
systems. The answer lay some- 
where on the planet beneath them. 

The dials checked, Eric let his 
mind wander once again to the dis- 

THE SEVENTH MAN 



embarkation procedures. Unless 
Raines decided differently stan- 
dard procedures would be em- 
ployed — the same as Odyssey One 
had used. 

Standard procedure dictated 
that he, as second in command, 
would remain on board the ship, 
monitoring communications and 
assuring that there would be at 
least one man to guide the ship 
home to Earth should some un- 
foreseen disaster befall the rest. 

The six others would disembark 
in two teams, three men to a team, 
utilizing the ion-propelled Surface 
Excursion Vehicles, or ‘scooters.’ 

One of the vehicles would de- 
scend to the surface and, if prelim- 
inary instrument readings were 
favorable, land. The second vehicle 
would monitor the first for up to 
three hours before landing. Then, 
if there were no indication of dan- 
ger, a site would be selected and 
the main ship would come down on 
the planet’s surface, providing a 
base of operations for the extended 
period of exploration that would 
follow. 

“Major Bentzel, how do you 
view our situation?” 

“So far,” Eric said slowly, 
weighing each word, “we’ve done 
everything in emulation of Odys- 
sey One. They lost contact and 
we’ve lost contact. In a sense 
we’re flying blind. We have no ex- 
planation for the breakdown. 
Now, we’ve been around the planet 
six times and have seen no sign of 
wreckage.” 



125 




“In eighteen years,” Chiang 
said. “Odyssey One or its pieces 
would have fallen out of orbit.” 

“Why couldn’t the men still be 
alive down on the surface?” asked 
Fred Richter, the youngest mem- 
ber of the crew. 

Raines pointed to the orange 
blur just coming into sight in the 
right hand portal. Richter fell si- 
lent. 

Eric cleared his throat and the 
other men turned their attention 
back to him. “In any event,” he 
continued, “Odyssey One was de- 
stroyed. It would seem to me that 
we had better initiate alternate 
procedures.” 

“I’ve done some preliminary 
calculations,” Raines said. “It 
would seem to me feasible to set 
up a moon base — say, on Io, 
since it’s closest to our position — 
and set up an observatory. I am in 
absolute agreement with Major 
Bentzel. We cannot attempt to 
reach the planet’s surface until we 
discover why we can’t communi- 
cate with Earth. We can’t simply 
turn around and go back. There- 
fore, using a moon base as an in- 
termediate landing station would 
appear to be the only answer. To 
keep the ship in a stable orbit re- 
quires too much power. Any com- 
ments?” 

There were none. Eric could feel 
an atmosphere of excitement and 
anticipation building in the ship, 
clinging to the men like static elec- 
tricity. Raines’ tone had become 



harder, and his words were clipped. 

“Tack, you take Richter and 
Rhodes. Run an instrument check 
on Io. See if there is a place we 
can land this thing.” 

Colonel Takata Takamoto sa- 
luted. He motioned to Richter and 
Rhodes who followed him into the 
suiting room. Eric did some rapid 
figuring in his head and calculated 
that at top speed, the scouting 
mission would take just under six 
hours. He wished he were going. 
The walls of the ship seemed to be 
diminishing, closing in on him. 
Soon he would be the only one 
left, trapped inside the metal 
womb. 

Eric shook his head and tried to 
concentrate on Raines’ voice. With 
a little luck, he’d have ground be- 
neath his feet in two or three days. 

The bright red scooter contain- 
ing Takamoto, Richter and 
Rhodes glided past the portal. The 
signal light on the computer con- 
sole lit and Eric quickly pressed 
the lever, returning the signal. 
Raines exchanged a series of quips 
with Takamoto and then signed 
off. They had at least established 
voice communication with the 
scooter. 

“I’m going to take the blue 
scooter down to the outer fringes 
of the atmosphere for a test 
probe,” Raines said. “I want some 
samples of that atmosphere. That 
will save us a lot of time once we 
get set up on Io.” 

“Better take us along,” Oliver 



126 



IF 




said, indicating himself and Kyoto 
Chiang. “You won’t be able to 
operate all of the collecting devices 
and still run the scooter. It’ll be 
easier and safer if the scooter’s 
fully manned.’’ 

“All right,’’ Raines said. “Let’s 

go” 

Eric followed the three men into 
the suiting room, helped them into 
their suits, went with them down to 
the vehicle bay. 

The blue scooter was painstak- 
ingly checked out before Raines, 
Chiang and Oliver assumed their 
positions in the tiny craft. Eric 
went down the line of men, grip- 
ping each hand in turn. Finally he 
stepped into an observation cham- 
ber. 

He watched as the canopy of the 
craft slid into place. Raines’ right 
hand moved to the control panel 
of the craft and the ship’s huge 
bay doors opened long enough to 
allow the blue scooter to pass out 
between them. Then they closed. 

The assault on Jupiter was un- 
der way. 

H E AWOKE with a start, 
straining for some sound in 
the impersonal silence around him. 
Nothing. The ship was all right. 

Eric glanced at his watch. Five 
and a half hours had elapsed since 
the red and blue scooters had dis- 
embarked on their missions. They 
had missed four communications 
checks. 

Or he had missed them. 

He had had a headache and had 



decided to rest in his cubicle. He’d 
fallen asleep. Still, the siren attach- 
ment was designed to sound 
throughout the entire ship if a sig- 
nal came through. But that had to 
be activated. Had he set it before 
lying down? 

He sprang off the couch and 
hurried out of the cubicle over to 
the communications control panel. 
His gaze darted to the siren switch. 
It was set. 

He stared at the dials for a mo- 
ment, then hurriedly set them to 
Raines’ frequency. 

“Control calling Bluebird. 
Commander, this is Major Bent- 
zel. Can you hear me? Control 
calling Bluebird. Come in, Blue- 
bird.’’ 

No answer came. Eric left 
Raines’ frequency open and cut in 
the backup system. 

“Control calling Redbird! Tack, 
can you hear me? Control calling 
Redbird. Acknowledge at once.” 

His efforts were rewarded by a 
dead silence. He struggled against 
little ripples of panic that were 
welling up inside him. One more 
scooter was left in the bay and he 
knew he would use it if the time- 
cushion elapsed. He would have 
to. He knew he could not simply 
pilot the ship home, leaving the 
others to die, even if procedure 
dictated that he do so. Psychiatric 
Realignment could only do so 
much for a man’s peace of mind. 

Then the ship was filled with the 
shriek of the siren tearing through 



THE SEVENTH MAN 



127 




the terrible silence that had pre- 
ceded it. Eric reached out and shut 
off the switch that had been turned 
up to full volume. The pain in his 
ears was delightful. 

“Control here. Tack, where the 
hell are you?” 

“Eric, we’re coming in.” Taka- 
moto’s voice was strained, brittle 
with tension. “Look through your 
left portal. Tell me if you can see 

us.” 

Eric looked. The red scooter 
was just coming into sight, glitter- 
ing in the strange, reflected glow 
of the planet. 

“I can see you,” Eric said. 
“Tack, what’s the matter?” 

“No time now. I’ll tell you 
when we get to the ship.” 

Eric monitored the docking of 
the red scooter. In a few moments 
the three crewmen entered the 
main chatnber. They had removed 
only their helmets. 

Tack went directly to the com- 
munications panel. He quickly 
scanned the computer tapes. 

“Eric, did you receive any sig- 
nals prior to ours?” 

“No,” Eric said impatiently. He 
was anxious to learn what had 
happened. “Only the last one. Just 
before that I tried to contact you 
but couldn’t get any signal at all. 
There’s no word from Raines — he 
took the blue scooter.” He hesi- 
tated a moment, trying to read the 
expression on the crewman’s face. 
“What happened?” 

“I don’t know,” Tack said 



slowly. “We scouted Io, found a 
plain and went down. Then we 
tried to contact you and couldn’t 
get through.” 

“We thought we’d lost the ship,” 
Rhodes said quietly. 

Tack asked, “Where is Raines?” 

“He and the others went down 
to collect samples of the atmo- 
sphere.” Eric felt a stab of guilt, 
as if he were responsible for what 
now seemed to have been an ex- 
ceedingly foolish decision. “They 
were just going into the outer pe- 
rimeter.” 

Tack was shaking his head. 
“But you picked up our last sig- 
nal.” 

“Yes.” 

“I could tell by our own in- 
struments that we were getting 
through. But we were already in 
visual contact. It looks as though 
our radio equipment is no better 
than our eyesight. We might as 
well be using smoke signals. There 
must be something about the at- 
mosphere. Ionization?” 

Eric shrugged. He was grappling 
with the problem of the blue 
scooter. At least four of the crew 
were safe now. He must decide 
whether or not to leave the other 
three. If he did, it would be dec- 
ades before the attempt would be 
made again, if ever. The responsi- 
bility bore down on him, threaten- 
ing to crush him with its weight. 

“I doubt it,” Eric said softly. 
“Our instruments would have 
picked up excess ionization. Every- 



128 



IF 




thing checks out perfectly, except 
our communications. Damn it. 
There’s just no explanation.” 

“You’re in command now. 
Raines is out there some place. 
You have to make a decision,” 
Takamoto said. 

Eric waited until he was reason- 
ably certain that his voice would 
not tremble. 

“I won’t send you to your 
deaths. It would make no sense.” 

“It doesn’t make any sense to 
give up at this point, either. It 
takes only one man to bring this 
ship back. One or four, it makes 
no difference; if we fail, there 
won’t be another mission for a 
hundred years. You know that.” 

“I know that the waste of life 
has no place in the exploration of 
space.” 

“But you may be wasting the 
others’ lives,” Tack said, his voice 
still very calm. “You don’t know 
that Raines and the others are 
dead. They could be down there 
right now, drifting around in a 
crippled ship, waiting for someone 
to come and get them. If we left 
now we’d be sentencing them to 
death. We can’t live with that for 
the rest of our lives.” 

“I’m the only one who has to 
live with anything. It’s my deci- 
sion. I will not send you down 
there.” 

Tack drew himself up to his full 
height, snapped to attention. His 
eyes locked with Eric’s. 

“Sir,” Tack said, “I wish to vol- 



unteer to search for Commander 
Raines.” 

Richter and Rhodes stepped for- 
ward and stood at attention on 
either side of Takamoto. The rig- 
idity of their bodies and the hard 
cast of their eyes formed an un- 
breachable wall between them and 
the new commander. Eric would 
have given anything to be able to 
step to the other side of the bar- 
rier. 

“I’ll give you four hours,” Eric 
said at last. “No more. At the end 
of four hours I blast out of orbit.” 
“Not to do so would be a dere- 
liction of duty, sir,” Takamoto 
said, allowing the smile in his eyes 
to spread to his mouth. “We com- 
pletely understand.” 

“I can only give you their last 
coordinates before they entered 
the atmosphere.” 

“That should be sufficient, sir. 
We can track with the radar.” 

“We will maintain constant 
voice communication.” 

“Yes, sir. May we leave now?” 
“Four hours.” 

“Four hours.” 

Eric swallowed hard. “For 
God’s sake, Tack, be careful.” 

In a few minutes they were 
gone.

ing given by Dr. Roger LaTrane 
to support personnel of Odyssey 
Two. 

Subject: Status of mission and ra- 
dio wave patterns of the planet 
Jupiter. 

Three days ago we received the 
first voice transmission from Od- 
yssey Two. Major Bentzel was the 
first to undergo transition. He im- 
mediately informed us that all was 
well. He indicated that there were 
some problems in transition, and 
that we will have to further refine 
the F-7 series of hibernative drugs. 
However, the remainder of the 
crew underwent transition without 
any noticeable physical or psycho- 
logical damage. 

The families were notified and 
messages were sent and received. 
Needless to say, the men and their 
families were happy to hear each 
others’ voices after two years of 
waiting. 

Our telemetry monitoring de- 
vices gave every indication 
throughout the two-year journey 
that all systems were functioning 
perfectly. Major Bentzel’s voice 
transmission served to increase 
our feelings of optimism. 

Now it is my sad duty to report 
to you that we have completely 
lost communication with Odyssey 
Two. Telemetry ceased soon after 
the ship went into orbit around 
Jupiter. 

We are continuing to emit a 
series of electronic probes but, as 
of this time, our instruments in- 
dicate the ship no longer exists.

Dr. Miller has been continuing 
to study the unusual radio bursts 
from the vicinity of the planet, the 
signals that led us to send out 
Odyssey Two. It is Dr. Miller’s 
contention that these bursts of en- 
ergy may be read as a sort of 
code. As incredible as this may 
seem, I feel we are in no position 
to discount any theory about the 
planet Jupiter. 

Dr. Miller’s computations and 
symbol reconstruction will be dis- 
tributed to you in a separate 
memo. 

Dr. Miller’s work leads him to 
believe that the signals may be in- 
terpreted in such a manner that 
they spell out the following words: 
I-T I-S A-L-I-V-E.

Stray wisps of gas danced over the 
craft’s hull in brilliant, swirling 
rainbows of phosphorescent fire. 
The radar gave no indication of 
another craft in their vicinity. 
Tack flew on, down toward the 
planet’s surface. Soon the scooter 
was completely enveloped in gas 
of a thicker density, deeper and 
darker in color. 

Tension limited the conversa- 
tion of the men to brief exchanges 
concerned solely with the opera- 
tion of the craft and readings of 
the radar sweeps. They did not dis- 
cuss the fact that they had lost 

IF 




communication with the main ship, 
nor that the craft was beginning to 
feel sluggish, a small sliver of met- 
al drowning in some mad artist’s 
pallet of oils. There seemed noth- 
ing to do but go on; the skein of 
logic they had presented to Eric 
back on the main ship still seemed 
valid. One man could bring the 
ship back to Earth just as easily as 
four. There was a reason they had 
undertaken this journey. 

The instruments continued to 
indicate that they were still far 
above the point where the atmo- 
sphere might be expected to con- 
dense or liquefy and the actual 
surface of the planet was thou- 
sands of miles below that. Still, 
something was happening in the 
atmosphere outside the craft. They 
were slowing. 

Acting on impulse, Tack 
reached up and shut off the bea- 
cons; they were surrounded by an 
iridescent glow that seemed to 
spring from the metal itself, as if 
it were ablaze. Tack’s gaze fixed 
on the instrument panel; the temp- 
erature readings were normal. 

The shimmering glow changed 
from a deep orange to brick red, 
then to a deep, garish purple that 
glowed brighter, as if from an en- 
ergy source of its own. Droplets 
of gas were condensing on the out- 
side of the hull. The droplets 
thickened and coalesced into 
clumps of jelly-like matter that 
spread rapidly over the entire outer 
surface of the scooter, blocking 

THE SEVENTH MAN 



off the vision of the men inside. 
Streaks of blue and silver ap- 
peared as the substance ate 
through the enamel and attacked 
the metal alloy of the scooter it- 
self. 

Tack struggled frantically with 
controls that did not respond. The 
air speed indicator showed that 
they were almost at a standstill, a 
metallic vegetable suspended in a 
monstrous bowl of celestial Jello. 
Tack thrust the emergency throt- 
tle forward. His ears told him that 
the engines were operating at peak 
capacity, screaming and tearing at 
the ooze that surrounded them. 
The scooter remained motionless. 

Tack heard a choked gasp be- 
hind him. He twisted around in his 
seat, freezing halfway as his eyes 
came to rest on the tiny, white 
glistening drops of molten metal 
that dripped from the ceiling, float- 
ing free in the zero-G environ- 
ment. He watched in numb, hor- 
rified fascination as one of the 
droplets came to rest on Chiang’s 
arm. The fabric of the crewman’s 
suit began to smoke. The ship was 
dissolving around them. 

There was little time to cry, or 
even to scream. The entire reac- 
tion reached its peak in a matter 
of seconds. The scooter and its 
human occupants broke up and 
dissolved in the thick jelly, trans- 
forming their matter into gaseous 
elements to float for eternity 
above the shape of a globe they 
had never seen.

E RIC watched the fatal digit on 
the time-lapse recorder clunk 
into place, signaling the deaths of 
six men and a dream. Jupiter had 
defeated them. It was time to go 
home. 

He was mildly surprised to find 
that he felt little emotion. He had 
seen death in the eyes of his men 
before they had left the ship, had 
felt and heard it in the empty si- 
lence of the radio. Now that death 
was a reality, Eric found that he 
had already been drained of sor- 
row and apprehension. He was the 
only one left, the seventh man, and 
it was his clear duty to bring the 
ship back to Earth. Still he hesi- 
tated, watching with mild interest 
as the digits on the clock marked 
the passage of time in the empty 
chamber. He found the concept of 
time suddenly void of meaning; 
life and death were the only mark- 
ers, the only boundaries within 
which a man could measure the 
value of his existence. 

An hour later Eric had still not 
begun the preparation of the ship 
for the return voyage. He found 
himself walking slowly down the 
passageway leading to the vehicle 
launch bay. He stopped at the end 
and peered through the glass win- 
dow into the airlock where the last 
scooter sat in its concrete berth, 
its engines ready, if need be, to 
send him soaring down after the 
others to continue the search. His 
hand reached out and stroked the 
silver surface of the space suit 



hanging in an open cubicle next to 
the entrance to the airlock. 

Once again, as he had done so 
many times in the past, Eric 
thought of Claude Philmore, his 
counterpart on the first mission. 
Certainly, Eric thought, Philmore 
must have been in this same situa- 
tion. Perhaps he had even stood in 
this same spot on his own ship 
when the time had come for him 
to make his final decision. What 
had he done? That was the ques- 
tion that pounded at Eric's con- 
sciousness. It seemed obvious that 
the man had ignored his directives 
and taken the third scooter. Then 
what of the ship? Perhaps he had 
tried to bring it back and had been 
caught in a meteor storm. No, 
Eric thought; any activity like that 
would have been monitored back 
on Earth. Then what of the ship? 
And the signals? And the silence? 

Eric turned and made his way 
back to the main chamber. His 
footsteps echoed on the metal sur- 
faces, mocking him. He wept free- 
ly. At that moment he would have 
given his life for one single mo- 
ment with the sea at his feet or 
sunlight on his upturned face. 

The preparations did not take 
long. The ship had been designed 
for emergency one-man operation 
and it was simply a matter of re- 
programing the computer and re- 
setting the various instruments 
that would serve to guide the huge 
machine back through the two 
year night to orbit around the 



132 



IF 




planet that hung in space like an 
exquisite, blue jewel, an oasis in a 
desert of death. 

The computer set, Eric returned 
to his cubicle and strapped himself 
into his life-support couch. He in- 
serted the intravenous feeders into 
the metal caps implanted in his 
arms, then prepared to inject the 
F-7 solution into his veins. The 
fluid, dark amber in color, floated 
in the vacuum inside the hypoder- 
mic needle. Eric pulled back the 
plunger and held the tip a fraction 
of an inch above the blue, dis- 
tended surface of a large vein on 
the inside of his elbow. 

He blinked. Somewhere in his 
mind a curtain had parted and 
something was shining in the 
darkness — a piece of a puzzle. 
Eric very carefully replaced the 
hypodermic needle in its refriger- 
ated container, unstrapped his 
body, removed the plastic feeders, 
then hurried back to the vehicle 
launch chamber. From there he 
deactivated the blast-off controls 
and checked to make certain the 
ship would remain in orbit. Then 
he donned his suit and entered the 
pressure chamber. 

He thought he had seen one 
piece of the puzzle. Now he must 
search for the remaining pieces. 
He was sure he knew where to 
look. 

His Fingers trembled as he 
checked and rechecked the 
scooter’s instruments and energy 
bank. Satisfied at last that all was 



in order, Eric climbed in and 
closed the canopy above his head. 
He pushed the launch lever and the 
craft slid from its berth out into 
space. He allowed himself a few 
seconds to float free of the main 
ship, then touched the ignition but- 
ton. The engines of the vehicle 
roared to life, speeding the man 
and his machine out into the void 
toward the object of his search. 

P HILMORE, Eric thought. His 
answers had to tie in with Phil- 
more. 

If Philmore were alive and in 
some way responsible for the al- 
tered phenomenon puzzling Earth 
— where would he be? He could 
not be on the planet’s surface. Eric 
was sure of that. He had to be on 
one of the moons. 

How could he have survived all 
these years? 

Eric knew such survival was 
theoretically possible in the physi- 
cal sense. Food, elimination of 
body wastes and other physical 
needs were taken care of by cycli- 
cal apparatus within the environ- 
ment of the scooter. Water and 
oxygen could be reconstituted 
from wastes for an indefinite pe- 
riod of time and the food could 
have come from the stores on the 
ship. The chemical nutrients alone 
could sustain one man for an in- 
determinate number of years. 

Still, it seemed highly unlikely 
that any man could maintain his 



THE SEVENTH MAN 



133 




sanity for any great length of time 
here — sufficiently to develop an 
apparatus capable of interfering 
with the signals from the planet. 
He would see, Eric thought. Phil- 
more, if he were alive, would 
have all the answers. 

Eric set his craft in a trajectory 
that he had "calculated would take 
him to the first of his targets, one 
of the smaller moons now on the 
far side of the planet. He esti- 
mated it would take him months 
to scan the surfaces of all twelve 
satellites and he wondered what 
his own mental condition would 
be if, after all that searching, he 
found nothing. He decided it 
would do no good to dwell on 
such things. He began a detailed 
systems check to help the time 
pass. 

Days passed. He scanned each 
square mile of the first moon’s 
surface with skill and precision 
bom of years of training. He had 
quickly developed a system; after 
an initial scanning flight he would 
prepare a detailed grid on the 
photographic charts and begin a 
new, inch-by-inch scan of that 
particular moon’s geography. He 
flew at low speed and dangerously 
low altitude. Even then he would 
often be left with the haunting 
thought that he had somehow 
missed Philmore. 

He would finish with one satel- 
lite, go on to the next, fighting the 
compulsion to go back and search 
again. He knew he had no time to 



waste — Ganymede alone would 
take him three or four months to 
scan properly. He must go on. 

Once he landed and slept for 
fifteen hours in the cramped quar- 
ters of the scooter. Another time, 
on the third moon he had chosen, 
he had been forced to get out and 
search on foot through a vast hilly 
region, pock-marked with caves. 
They had been four hungry, thirst- 
filled days as he had been forced to 
trek in an ever-widening circle, 
farther and farther from the life- 
support systems of the scooter. 

Soon Eric was flying the craft in 
a semi-stupor, unthinking, me- 
chanically performing the flight 
operations as the scooter flew 
from one moon to the next; he 
listened like an automaton for the 
dull click of his instruments that 
would tell him the next satellite 
was near, another dead body to 
map and search and leave behind. 
He felt his soul slowly being torn 
apart, scattered about a few pieces 
at a time, strewn behind him on 
the moons’ surfaces. 

He traveled in a counter-clock- 
wise orbit around Jupiter so that 
the glow from the planet was al- 
ways on his left side. Once he de- 
veloped fever and was forced to 
stop and rest. He tossed fitfully in- 
side the scooter, his nightmares 
filled with gaseous, orange-red 
beasts that clawed at his shaking, 
fever- wracked body. 

He reached Ganymede twenty- 
seven days from the time he had 



134 



IF 




left the main ship. The day after 
that he found it. 

Fatigue and shock had taken 
their toll of him. He could feel 
hysterical, insane laughter swelling 
and ’bubbling in his throat, about 
to erupt in a geyser that, once re- 
leased, would never stop. He ex- 
perienced a sudden sensation of 
being a part of the scooter, a 
growth on its innards; he would 
ram the machine into the surface 
of the moon and at last the night- 
mare would end. 

Below him, barely visible be- 
neath the lip of a ledge, its chipped 
and tarnished surface gleaming 
dully in the glare of his beacons, 
was a green scooter identical to 
his own. 

Eric swallowed his laughter and 
brought his craft back under con- 
trol. He circled the area, dropping 
lower on each turn. Adrenalin 
surged through his body to the 
point where he felt he must scream 
with joy. But he dared not, for the 
same reason that he dared not 
laugh; once started, it might not 
stop. 

A figure emerged from beneath 
the rock shelf, arms waving and 
neck craned in an effort to keep 
the scooter constantly in view as it 
circled over his head. Twice the 
figure stumbled and fell against 
the sharp rocks strewn across the 
surface. Eric groaned — and this 
time the laughter found vent and 
trickled from his lips. How funny 
it would be, Eric thought, to go 



through all this and then see Phil- 
more die before his eyes. 

Each time the figure rose, its 
suit intact, and continued its mad 
pursuit of the path of the descend- 
ing scooter. 

“Stop running, Philmore,” Eric 
screamed. “For God’s sake, stop 
running. I’m coming down!” 

His voice echoed loudly and 
Eric snapped back to reason. Of 
course Philmore could not hear 
him; but the man had stopped run- 
ning and was now standing mo- 
tionless at the lip of a medium- 
sized crater, still looking upward. 
Eric imagined he could hear the 
anguished cries of joy spilling 
from the man’s open mouth. 

Ill 

H E BROUGHT the scooter 
down a hundred yards from 
where the man was standing. Then 
Philmore was running again; lum- 
bering and falling, rising and lum- 
bering again, seemingly indiffer- 
ent to the danger of tearing his 
suit on the rocks. 

Was Philmore mad? The 
thought struck Eric that the man 
might kill them both here on 
Ganymede. 

Philmore stopped when he was 
still ten yards away. Eric tensed, 
then relaxed; he saw, Philmore’s 
shoulders heave with great sobs. 
Pale, bleached-out eyes filled with 
tears. Eric stepped forward and 
held out his gloved hand. Philmore 



THE SEVENTH MAN 



135 




hesitated, then reached out and 
touched it with his own. A mo- 
ment later they were together, 
hugging one another’s shielded 
bodies. 

When the first waves of emotion 
had passed, Eric stepped back and 
glanced around. His eyes came to 
rest on a series of letters that Phil- 
more, in some moment of unbear- 
able loneliness, had carved into the 
rock shelf above his scooter. The 
edges of the letters still showed 
the scars of radiation from Phil- 
more’s cutting torch. It was a 
plea — and an affirmative — to the 
surrounding darkness: 

I SHALL LIVE IN MY MIND! 

Philmore’s eyes followed the 
direction of Eric’s. Finally he 
looked back at Eric. His mouth 
creased in a sad and distant smile 
and he shrugged. 

Philmore suddenly grabbed 
Eric’s arm and began pulling him 
in the direction of the sheltered 
scooter. Eric’s own excitement 
made him equally oblivious to the 
dangers of falling as he trotted 
along beside the other man. In less 
than a minute they were beneath 
the rock ledge. 

Eric could see that a door had 
been cut into the side of the 
scooter and the canopy had been 
sealed with some kind of material 
that he could not immediately 
identify. Philmore led him through 
the door, then closed it behind 
them. There was a hissing sound 



and in a few moments a second 
door, carved at the opposite end 
of the scooter opened. Only then 
did Eric realize that the entire 
scooter had been transformed by 
Philmore into a primitive, but ef- 
fective, airlock. He passed 
through the second door and 
found himself in a cave, lit by 
some energy source that Eric 
knew must come from the com- 
ponents of the scooter. 

The walls of the cave were com- 
pletely covered with the same 
translucent material that had been 
used to seal the canopy. On close 
inspection Eric discovered the ma- 
terial to be composed of some 
sort of wax or some glucose com- 
pound. It was fantastic, Eric 
thought; Philmore had found a 
way to alter the food compounds 
in the scooter’s life-support sys- 
tem to produce what was, in ef- 
fect, an airtight cocoon. The entire 
cave was lined with what seemed 
to be light, volcanic rock, easy to 
cut and move around. 

Some pieces were striking in 
their resemblance to chairs, sofas 
and other items of furniture. Eric 
turned and looked at the other 
man with a new sense of awe; 
Philmore looked pleased. He was 
obviously proud of his handiwork. 

The entire rear area of the cave 
was taken up by a mass of elec- 
tronic gear. Some of the pieces 
looked as though they had been 
fashioned by hand. How? Eric 
thought. And from what? 



136 



IF 




Plaques and stone carvings de- 
corated the cave. One picture de- 
picted the bare outlines of a man, 
a woman and three children. Eric 
quickly looked away. 

Philmore’s fingers trembled as 
he attempted to remove his suit. 
Eric stepped forward and helped 
him, then removed his own. They 
stood for long moments, staring 
at each other. 

“I’m Eric Bentzel,” Eric said at 
last. He could think of nothing 
else to say. 

Philmore’s lips moved but no 
sound issued from his mouth. He 
put his hand to his throat and be- 
gan to gag. Eric moved forward 
but Philmore raised a hand and 
Eric paused. A thin stream of 
saliva trickled from the edge of the 
other man’s mouth and his face 
was crimson, flushed with the ter- 
rible effort of speaking. Finally, 
the human sounds came. 

“I . I’m . Cl-Claude Phil- 
more. My name is Claude Phil- 
more.” 

“I know,” Eric said quietly. 

Now Philmore’s words seemed 
to come easier. He cleared his 
throat and swallowed hard. “My 
God, Eric, I thought I’d never 
hear a human voice again. I used 
to talk to myself all the time in 
the beginning. Then I just stopped. 
Outside there, while you were 
circling, I was screaming. Just 
screaming. I thought I’d forgotten 
how to speak.” 

Both men sat and were content, 



for long moments, to feast in si- 
lence on the sight of each other. 
Then they spoke for many hours 
of home — the Earth and the smells 
of living things. Eric found him- 
self increasingly reluctant to leave 
the subject, to return to the harsh 
reality that was the planet Jupiter 
and its moons. When he did ques- 
tion Philmore, it was in a very 
gentle tone that completely masked 
the impatience building inside him. 

Philmore listened patiently to 
Eric’s account of the signal recep- 
tions on Earth, then turned and 
stared at the equipment at the 
back of his cave. 

“You managed those bursts of 
signals, didn’t you?” Eric said. 

A VACANT expression crossed 
Philmore’s face, like that 
of a man struggling to remember 
the details of a place or event that 
was only dim history. At last his 
eyes came into focus and there 
was a trace of sadness in his voice; 
he too had found solace in their 
earlier talk. 

“It’s a very long story,” Phil- 
more said. “What I did and how I 
went about it is recorded in the 
computer bank of the scooter, al- 
though the tapes may be dam- 
aged. I had to use some of the 
computer components for the 
equipment you see back there. 

“It appears that all of Jupiter’s 
moons went through a volcanic 
period, much more severe than 
that of Earth. As a result, there 



THE SEVENTH MAN 



137 




are many materials here that do 
not exist at home. In fact, I would 
guess that the entire crust of this 
moon and the others is composed 
of a substance completely alien to 
us, most likely formed by a com- 
bination of volcanic heat and the 
cold of space out here.” 

Philmore paused, as if waiting 
for Eric to make some remark. 
Eric remained silent, running his 
fingers through some of the fine 
dust on the floor of the c^ve. He 
noticed that it had a distinct me- 
tallic quality. 

“This material tends to bend 
and distort radio waves,” Phil- 
more continued. “Since the moons 
form a virtual band about the 
planet itself, this accounts for the 
erratic radio phenomena always 
observed on Earth. Also, they 
make any kind of radio transmis- 
sion within their boundaries virtu- 
ally impossible. If you’re very 
close to your target, you may get 
some kind of signal. Otherwise the 
signals are absorbed by the elec- 
tromagnetic bands created by the 
moons’ interaction with the plan- 
et.” 

Eric had risen to his feet and 
was running his hands over the 
equipment Philmore had assem- 
bled. He had never before seen 
anything like it. 

“How did you manage to in- 
terfere with the signals? What is 
this, some kind of radio transmit- 
ter?” 

Philmore was shaking his head. 



“It’s not quite that simple,” he 
said quietly. “I don’t really know 
what you’d call it. And it doesn’t 
transmit signals at all; it charges 
the mountain above our heads and 
the ground around us.” 

Eric turned and stared at Phil- 
more. Philmore shook his head. 

“I can’t explain it all now. It 
took me years even to conceive of 
the plan — and then there were 
years of building and planting elec- 
trodes in the ground. Working on 
that was the only thing that kept 
me sane all these years. 

“Most of that metal you see I 
smelted from the rocks around us. 
Using it, I was able to build a sort 
of generator that I used to hook 
up to the power source in the 
scooter. I then attached this to the 
electrode system I had planted — ” 

“You mean you were able to 
electrify this whole moon?!” 

“Not exactly. But I was able to 
generate enough power to charge 
a large area around us. This dis- 
turbed the moon’s electromagnetic 
field and further distorted the sig- 
nals that passed by from the plan- 
et out into space. I was able to 
compute the relative position of 
the Earth by star charts. Each time 
I passed through what I calculated 
to be a vector where Ganymede 
was between Jupiter and the Earth, 
I activated the generator. 

“It was an absolutely insane 
idea. But, you see, I had nothing 
else, no other hope. I didn’t dream 
that it would actually work, but 



138 



IF 




from what — you’ve — said, I — ” 
Philmore’s eyes had again 
grown dark and vacant. He seemed 
to be trying to recall something — 
a memory so terrible that it had 
been buried deep within Philmore’s 
subconscious and was only now 
emerging. 

“You what?’’ Eric prompted. 

“I — it was only a few months 
ago,” Philmore stammered. He 
seemed completely disoriented. 
“It was only a few months ago I 
was able to control the reaction to 
the point where I thought I could 
send some kind of message.” 
“Message?” 

“A — code. That is, if anybody 
was — picking up the interference 
in the first place.” Philmore hes- 
itated, shaking his head back and 
forth. Suddenly he looked up, his 
eyes wild and burning with fever- 
ish intensity. His thin hand 
reached out and circled Eric’s 
wrist in a viselike grip. “Your 
ship!” Philmore yelled. “Where 
did you leave your ship?! Did you 
land it on one of the moons?!” 
“No,” Eric said, confused by 
the sudden change in the man, “I 
left it in orbit. It’s easier — ” 

He stopped. Strange sounds 
were coming from the other man’s 
throat, completely different from 
those he had made in his first ef- 
fort to speak. Philmore was rock- 
ing back and forth, chuckling 
grotesquely. Finally his soft 
laughter rose and split into peals 
of insane howling. 



Eric hit him hard across the 
face: Philmore choked, then col- 
lapsed into Eric’s arms, his hys- 
teria broken. At last he stepped 
back and heaved a huge sigh. 

“I think it’s too late,” Philmore 
said, handing Eric his pressure 
suit and donning his own. “I sup- 
pose we must try.” 

Eric was holding his helmet in 
his hands. “Too late for what?” 
“Don’t ask any questions now,” 
Philmore said. He spoke now in 
clear, firm tones. “We have to 
hurry. Maybe there is still time. 
I’ll try to explain on the way.” 
Philmore donned his helmet, 
masking the fine, grainy residue of 
fear and madness that had settled 
down into his eyes. 

Eric followed Philmore out of 
the airlock, across the surface of 
the moon to where he had left his 
scooter. His nerves felt on fire. 
Philmore’s energy and sudden de- 
termination had not masked the 
hopelessness lacing the tones of 
his voice like a floating, dissonant 
chord. 

E RIC brought the scooter’s tra- 
jectory into phase with the 
computed coordinates of the main 
ship and set the engines at full 
thrust. Philmore told his story in 
a low monotone, only occasionally 
interrupted by a sharp cry as one 
or the other pointed to a spot on 
the horizon that might be the ship 
and never was. 

The crew of Odyssey One had 



THE SEVENTH MAN 



139 




been totally unprepared for the 
disaster that befell them. Six of 
the men had been laughing and 
joking as they manned the two 
scooters and set off for the planet’s 
surface, leaving Philmore behind 
to man the main ship. Contact 
with them had been lost soon after 
the vehicles slipped into the fog of 
the atmosphere. 

Days passed and still Philmore 
had been reluctant to follow 
through with procedure and refturn 
the ship to Earth. He was con- 
vinced that the men were some- 
where on the surface of the planet, 
perhaps struggling with any one of 
hundreds of minor mishaps that 
might have occurred in the course 
of preliminary exploration. He 
could not go down after them; that 
would have been stretching pro- 
cedure too far. Besides, he had no 
coordinates to give him any indi- 
cation where they might be. But he 
would not leave them behind to 
die. He brought the ship into a 
tight, powered orbit just outside 
the atmosphere and settled down 
to wait for the men to effect their 
repairs and return. 

Philmore passed the time by 
running computer analyses of the 
gaseous components of the atmo- 
sphere. One of the first things he 
discovered was that the great red 
spot that scudded back and forth 
across the sphere appeared to be 
more than simply another, thicker 
layer of gases. For one thing, it 
appeared to be very dense, in which 



case it was difficult to explain why 
it was not pulled down to the sur- 
face by the planet’s gravitational 
field. 

The rest of his time was spent at 
the radio, running back and forth 
through the entire frequency band, 
then beginning again and working 
until his eyes grew red and his fin- 
gers numb, and he could no long- 
er continue. 

Philmore paid little attention to 
the flight instruments. He had 
computed that the ship could 
maintain its orbit for years, and 
there seemed little to gain in con- 
tinuous checking. He was almost 
completely absorbed by the prob- 
lem of contacting the men. 

After more than three weeks 
had passed Philmore finally de- 
cided that the others would not 
return. But when he began prepa- 
rations for the return flight he 
discovered that the ship had been 
steadily sinking deeper and deeper 
into the atmosphere. He opened 
the portals to discover that the 
entire ship was being coated with 
an orange slime that seemed to 
be eating away the outer hull. 

His attempts to power the ship 
out of the atmosphere failed; the 
force of the engines was insignifi- 
cant compared to the forces act- 
ing on the ship itself. He now 
knew what had happened to the 
two exploration vehicles and the 
men inside them — and knew the 
same thing must happen to him.

IF 




He acted instinctively, opting 
for any chance of survival, how- 
ever slight. He boarded the green 
scooter, activated the engines and 
shot full speed out through the 
clinging jelly. This initial, power- 
ful thrust had enabled Philmore to 
break free of the atmosphere, 
sending him back out into the vac- 
uum of space. 

Finally he had landed on Gany- 
mede. 

His first reaction had been one 
of elation and joy — he had sur- 
vived. Such feelings were quickly 
replaced by panic and despair. It 
seemed to him that he had merely 
traded one form of death for an- 
other, and he felt he had made a 
bad bargain — now he must die of 
loneliness. 

He knew that the systems in the 
scooter would keep him alive in- 
definitely, if he so desired. But 
there seemed no point — he would 
end as a vegetable, staring with 
blank eyes out over a bleak, lunar 
surface and become as bleak and 
lifeless as it. He would hear no 
sounds from the outside, for there 
was no air. In the heavens he 
would see the sun as a star shining 
just a bit brighter than those 
around it. 

In the beginning he knew he 
would be thinking of that same 
sun pouring warm, yellow rays of 
sunlight on the green and golden 
meadows near his home in the 
country. His wife and children 
would feel that warmth on their 



faces as they looked into the sky 
and thought of him. 

That same sun would be blazing 
on the Earth, sparkling in the blue- 
green waters of the lake where he 
and his wife had so often swum; 
it would melt Earth’s snows in the 
springtime, hurry clear, fresh 
clean water into cascading tor- 
rents. Towering trees would feel 
the warmth of its kiss as their 
roots sipped water from the warm 
soil beneath their branches. 

He would imagine all this, and 
he would study the dim twinkle of 
that blazing orb from a waterless 
world, mired in the powdery dust 
of Ganymede. 

Philmore was convinced that he 
would end as a mindless hulk, 
dashing out his brains on the dark, 
lifeless rocks around him. Better 
to shut down the life-support sys- 
tems in the scooter and die quick- 

ly- 

He did not shut down the sys- 
tems, though he did begin the pro- 
cess twice. Even as the tidal waves 
of depression had washed over 
him, his mind was at work, search- 
ing for physical and psychological 
means of survival. 

H E HAD realized that his only 
chance for survival lay in to- 
tal, relentless physical and mental 
activity. He had to free himself of 
thoughts that would destroy him. 

Philmore had been the geologist 
as well as second in command on 
Odyssey One. Consequently, his 



THE SEVENTH MAN 



141 




first task in his struggle for sur- 
vival was a thorough, painstaking 
survey of the rocks, minerals, ores 
and conglomerates on the satel- 
lite’s surface. At the end of the 
first year the chemicals in his kit 
had been depleted; but he had dis- 
covered the metallic nature of the 
moon’s surface and went on to 
compute that it was this material 
that was responsible for the dis- 
torted radio signals received on 
Earth. 

This task completed, there 
seemed little else to do. Soon Phil- 
more no longer cared to move, 
even from his seat inside the 
scooter. Day after endless day he 
sat, oblivious to his own filth. He 
felt the shrouds of mental oblivion 
closing over him and he found he 
no longer cared. 

He was uncertain as to what 
happened to bring him out of his 
trance. He thought it might have 
been the sight of a comet or mete- 
or flashing across the heavens. In 
any event, Philmore suddenly 
found himself staring at and focus- 
ing on the radio transmitter in- 
side the scooter. The next moment 
he was immersed in a task that 
would take him a score of years to 
complete. 

He expanded his living quarters, 
creating the cocoon material by 
experimenting with the food syn- 
thesizer controls until he produced 
a sticky fluid that could be spread 
and that hardened in a few hours, 
forming an airtight seal. During 



this time he had no means of sus- 
tenance and almost passed out 
from hunger. Finally he found the 
cave, and brought the scooter to 
it. He had coated the cave with his 
sealer and pressurized the interior. 
The last step had been to trans- 
form the scooter into an airlock so 
that he could move back and forth 
between the cave and the lunar sur- 
face. He was now without any 
form of transportation but he had 
a home. He considered it a good 
trade. 

Philmore realized that he would 
have to create a totally new form 
of communication. The germ of 
the idea for using the moon itself 
as a gigantic antenna or trans- 
mitter had already taken root, but 
he had no idea of how he was go- 
ing to go about putting the plan 
into effect. He sensed that his pre- 
sent knowledge was virtually use- 
less. It was the inadequacy of this 
knowledge, the necessity for years 
of continuous experimentation, 
that freed his mind from the tedi- 
ousness and danger of idle 
thought. 

There were no textbooks; only 
the transmitter and receiver in the 
scooter, inscrutable with the im- 
passive coldness of a machine. 
Armed only with three hundred 
pounds of transistors, transducers, 
coils, wires and crystals, Philmore 
began the struggle to pull his mind 
back from the brink of madness. 

It had taken Philmore eight 
hours completely to dismantle, 



142 



IF 




then about two years to master 
the communications theory that 
was sealed in its circuits. After 
that it took him three weeks to de- 
termine, beyond any doubt, that 
the entire frequency band of the 
set was inadequate to produce any 
kind of signal from within the 
electromagnetic barrier formed by 
Jupiter’s moons. 

Over the years, Philmore strip- 
ped the scooter of all components 
not essential to his own life sup- 
port. He used these spare parts to 
build new circuits to add to the 
old ones, gradually building a 
machine that was entirely differ- 
ent from the one he had begun 
with. Parts not available to him he 
made himself by smelting the 
metal compound from the rocks 
around him with his nuclear cut- 
ting torch. 

When he tired of this activity, 
Philmore would don his suit and 
venture out onto the moon^ sur- 
face, drilling holes into its surface 
and planting electrodes which he 
then connected to the machine un- 
der construction back in his cave. 
Month after month he would 
make his forays out onto the sur- 
face, ranging farther each time, 
planting an ever-increasing num- 
ber of his electronic seeds. 

Eric knew the rest of the story. 
Years of trial and error experi- 
ments had led to the disruption of 
signals that had been observed on 
Earth two and a half years before 
the launching of Odyssey Two. 



His last efforts had produced the 
message that Eric now heard for 
the first time. 

H e half turned in his 

seat, his face drawn into a 
mask of incredulity. He opened 
his mouth to speak but Philmore 
grabbed his arm and pointed to the 
navigational dials on the com- 
puter. Eric turned and felt his 
stomach contract as he glanced at 
the dial; they had reached the co- 
ordinates of the main ship and 
there was nothing in sight but the 
black emptiness of space and the 
orange glow of the planet’s atmo- 
sphere outside the canopy. 

“Give me the controls.” 

Eric impassively switched con- 
trol of the scooter to Philmore’s 
panel and sat dazedly staring out 
through the canopy into the void 
where the instruments and his rea- 
son told him the ship should be. 

Philmore quickly reset the 
flight coordinates so that the 
scooter would assume a tighter, 
looping orbit, sweeping in closer 
to the planet on each revolution. 
He set the engines at maximum 
power and the color code bars on 
the temperature controls began 
their slow climb into the red dan- 
ger zone. Eric ignored them. He 
had decided that if he must die he 
preferred that death to be rapid, 
inside the killer atmosphere. He 
did not think he could go through 
what Philmore had survived and he 
did not want to try. 



THE SEVENTH MAN

They were rapidly reaching a 
point of no return, the stage of the 
atmosphere. In addition, it would 
be virtually impossible to sight the 
ship visually. Without that visual 
sighting, it would be difficult, if 
not impossible, to dock the 
scooter. 

Eric was surprised to find that 
he was suddenly calm. He was 
tremendously grateful that he was 
not screaming at the approach of 
death, that he felt only a vast, suf- 
focating weariness. He wished it 
already over with, and was im- 
mediately ashamed of the thought. 

“Earlier you mentioned trans- 
mitting that something was alive 
here,” Eric said. He traced his fin- 
ger down the center of the canopy. 
Wisps of gas were beginning to 
collect around the scooter. “What 
could live in this?” 

Philmore kept his eyes on the 
radar but his voice cut through 
the silence and tension like a knife 
blade, rising and falling in staccato 
rhythms. “There’s nothing alive on 
the planet’s surface. It’s the at- 
mosphere itself that’s alive.” 

Philmore interrupted Eric’s 
shocked reply. 

“That mixture of gases is a liv- 
ing organism,” Philmore contin- 
ued. “I’m sure of it. I’ve been 
watching it for all these years, and 
I’m sure that I’m right. It’s not so 
obvious at first — but if you ob- 
serve it over a long period of time, 
you can see it pulsate in space. My 
guess is that it’s absorbing energy 



from the planet beneath — and any 
matter that enters it. 

“The organism seems to accept 
the moons as part of its own sys- 
tem but is extremely sensitive to 
any other body even approaching 
its perimeter. Our body reacts the 
same way, you know; when a 
germ enters our bloodstream, 
white blood cells gather to destroy 
it. It seems to be the same with 
that thing; it destroys — or perhaps 
consumes — anything that comes 
into contact with it.” 

“How?” Eric whispered. 

“I would guess by some dissolv- 
ing action. It transforms the in- 
truding body into energy to feed 
itself. The color changes are re- 
lated to the amount of energy it is 
absorbing at any one time. I’ve 
seen vast sections of atmosphere 
almost clear, translucent. Then a 
meteor shower will hit and the 
whole thing goes crazy, changing 
to all shades of red, orange and 
purple. And it starts to glow.” 

That same glow could now be 
seen surrounding the scooter’s 
canopy. Eric turned away, trying 
to erase the image from his mind. 

“How could such an organism 
exist?” 

“That I don’t know,” Philmore 
said. “I believe the thing to be a 
cell.” 

“A cell?” 

“Yes. Everything about it sug- 
gests a cell, including the way it 
destroys any foreign matter that 
enters it. That red spot that every- 



144 



IF 




one gets excited about is the cell’s 
nucleus.” 

“That’s impossible,” Eric said, 
feeling foolish and not understand- 
ing why. 

“Maybe,” Philmore said evenly. 
“But when you’ve been alone in 
space as long as I have, well, the 
fact is driven home that the uni- 
verse is, indeed, constructed on a 
very large scale.” 

“I know that,” Eric said. “But 
a cell? How could it exist alone?” 

Philmore shrugged. “On Earth 
cells evolved into larger organ- 
ism. Here, at the birth of the solar 
system, it occurred all at once, on 
a monstrous scale. Besides, may- 
be it doesn’t exist alone. Maybe 
there are countless billions more 
like it, scattered all through the 
universe. I tend to think it exists 
by itself — but there could be a 
larger organism and our entire 
solar system might be a part of it. 
Or maybe — ” 

Philmore’s voice rose and broke 
off in a strangled cry. Eric turned 
around and saw, far away to their 
left and surrounded by a murky 
glow, the dim outline of his ship. 

E RIC had resigned himself to 
death. Consequently he was al- 
most sorry they had found the 
ship. His old drives and training 
were returning and that meant 
simply that dying would be that 
much harder. Even from a dis- 
tance, Eric could see silver drops 



of condensation forming on the 
outer skin of the hull. 

“It’s too late,” Philmore whis- 
pered. “God in heaven, it’s too 
late!” Once again his eyes were 
clouded, and Eric could see that 
he was reliving the first voyage. 
The scooter was beginning to slow. 
“We have to go back.” Philmore 
said, struggling with the controls. 
The scooter began to turn, a ma- 
neuver that served to slow them 
even more. 

Eric quickly resumed control of 
the scooter. He knew they could 
not go back even if they wanted to 
— even if there were something 
more than a dead moon to return 
to. They were trapped in the atmo- 
sphere. The gas was growing thick- 
er every moment and Eric knew it 
would not be long before the jelly- 
like fluid that Philmore had de- 
scribed would be forming around 
the scooter. Their only hope was 
to reach the big ship. Eric steered 
the scooter in that direction. The 
vehicle moved slowly and slug- 
gishly — but it moved. Eric kept 
his hands firmly on the controls; 
if they did not return, there would 
never be another ship, not in their 
lifetime. 

“We have to go back — ” 

Philmore fought to resume con- 
trol of the scooter. Eric turned and 
hit Philmore hard on the side of 
the neck with his hand. Philmore 
slumped in his seat.

LIFE CYCLE 



E NSIGN BOB RYDER stood green gloaming of the swamp plan- 

back from the control panel of et. Norcriss’ waiting couch and 

his beloved machine with a weary Contact helmet lay idle beside the 

headshake. “It’s no use, sir,” he tailfins of the ship. “That’s the 

said. “Except for the bloodhounds same result the roborocket re- 

aboard ship, I get no life-pulse re- ported,” he mused uneasily. “And 

sponse from the directional beam.” yet the animal has been seen, En- 

Lieutenant Norcriss, startlingly sign.” 

white-thatched in his middle thir- “A swamp is a dangerous place, 
ties, sighed and looked into the sir,” said Ryder. “The dog could 

147 



have been swallowed up in a mo- 
rass, perhaps, or caught by one of 
those aquatic carnivores — ” 

Norcriss began to nod, still be- 
mused. Then he straightened and 
flicked a glance at the technician. 
“Or reverted to its primitive state,” 
he said sharply. “A dog forced to 
forage and kill for sustenance 
might not stay a canus domesticus 
for very long. Once its primal in- 
stincts are reawakened — ” 

“You think I might get results 
with a wolf-pulse tape,” Ryder in- 
terpreted soberly. “It’s possible, 
sir, of course — ” 

“But you have doubts?” asked 
Norcriss. 

“Yes,” Bob Ryder said, then 
added with a rueful grin, “and 
none of them logical. A change in 
a life-pulse is not an impossibility 
under certain circumstances. But 
it is a rarity — ” His voice trailed 
off as he concentrated on putting a 
new tape onto the takeup reel. 

Despite his doubts he was going 
ahead with the wolf-pulse check. 
Norcriss sat down upon the edge 
of the couch and watched him, 
marveling at the hundred and one 
finely calibrated adjustments the 
other man could make so uner- 
ringly in the complex machine 
without even a minor frown of 
tight concentration. Ryder loved 
and babied his device until its func- 
tion was as familiar to him as his 
own breathing. His fingers, flicker- 
ing from knurled knob to toggle- 
switch to lever to key, moved with 



sure and unfaltering steadiness. 

Norcriss, constitutionally un- 
able to allow his mind to idle over 
nothing in particular, presently 
thought back over the events that 
had brought them to the planet. 

The Ecologists of Earth had 
raised the first ripples of concern 
about colonization of Rigel II. 
Preliminary exploration by .robo- 
rocket had shown it eminently 
suited for certain human tempera- 
ments, mostly men and women of 
the tropic regions and especially 
the Seminole Indians of Florida 
and the many whites who had over 
many generations come to thrive 
on swamp-living along with their 
red-skinned neighbors. Roborock- 
ets, designed to orbit a planet until 
all species had had life-pulses cor- 
related with those of known spe- 
cies, had found no wild life insur- 
mountably dangerous to man on 
Rigel II — that is, any hazards to 
colonists could be met and over- 
come by simple vigilance and 
adeptness with 21st Century wea- 
ponry. 

The trouble was that: “The ani- 
mal life there is self-menacing,” 
said the Ecologists’ report. “A 
strange sort of apathy seems \o 
prevail among two of the most 
ubiquitous species; there is no in- 
built instinct for self-preservation. 
Luckily the beasts seem to be in- 
credibly prolific or they would long 
ago have died out. But putting a 
new factor — Man — on the planet 
might have decidedly disastrous re- 



148 



IF 




suits. Just a bit of imbalance in 
such a precarious ecology could 
turn the planet into a veritable 
graveyard. Life forms on any giv- 
en planet interlock like Chinese 
puzzles. Destroy but one segment 
— or let it destroy itself — and the 
entire framework collapses. And 
there is a third species which reacts 
bothersomely to self-awareness. 
Not that a spider, for instance, 
knows it is a spider — but it does 
know enough to use its poison 
fangs, to spin a web, or dig a pit. 
But one beast on Rigel II seems to 
be confused as to what it is. The 
roborocket tapes rated the beast 
strictly according to its level of in- 
telligence — its habits or life cycle 
remain mysteries. On these 
grounds — two life-apathetic spe- 
cies and one totally unknown type 
— we cannot recommend the plan- 
et for colonization until a qualified 
Space Zoologist has discovered 
more than we now know.” 

And perhaps not even then , Lieu- 
tenant Norcriss thought wryly. If 
his discoveries proved to be bad 
news colonization was out. He felt 
himself begin to shiver and fought 
his unease until it went away. To 
a Learner, a man whose survival 
in Contact with the mind of a sub- 
intelligent alien species was at the 
mercy of the creature’s survival — 
if it died while he was in the un- 
varying forty-minute Contact, so 
did he — the notion of being en- 
hosted in a species which didn’t 
seem to care if it lived or died was 



a chilling one. And this planet 
boasted two such species. 

T HE bloodhounds had been 
brought by Norcriss’ ship for 
the salient reason that a man’s in- 
stincts were not always up to the 
hazards of swampland areas; sel- 
dom sensitive to danger unless he 
heard or saw something amiss, he 
had to rely upon the keener aware- 
ness of potential menace in the 
mind and senses of the animal that 
was, on such a planet, more truly 
than ever man’s best friend. Three 
dogs had been taken along. On Ri- 
gel II they had, of course, been let 
outside the ship. Penned dogs grow 
extremely restive under any cir- 
cumstances — inside a metal-walled 
ship, with thrust, shifting gravita- 
tional norms and warping into hy- 
perspace to contend with, the an- 
imals had to be kept under seda- 
tion for most of the trip. But once 
outside the ship, something had 
happened. Something unexpected, 
something strange. After the ani- 
mals’ initial delirium of joy at be- 
ing freed to gambol about on the 
coarse-grassed hummock upon 
which the ship had set down, they’d 
lain in the hot greengold sunlight, 
ribs in-and-outing contentedly, 
slack jaws huffing to draw air 
across the cooling system of their 
tongues, tails wagging in slow, 
lazily comfortable oscillation — 
until one of them had sprung to its 
feet, a growl buzzing deep in the 
folds of its rippled, sagging throat.

It had dashed into a clump of 
reeds at the edge of the small hum- 
mock, sniffing busily. What it 
found among the reeds, no one 
knew. But with a yelp it had sprung 
backward, howling terribly and 
flopping about on its back. Then, 
with a strange grunting sound and 
an unwontedly awkward coordina- 
tion of its limbs, it had plunged 
without warning into the scummy 
waters of the swamp and slogged, 
splashed and paddled from sight, 
ignoring the shouts of the crew- 
men and the agitated barking of its 
fellows on the shore. 

Subsequent checking of the 
reeds showed nothing to the men 
of Norcriss’ ship. Reeds, water, 
scum, and nothing else. The two 
remaining hounds were brought to 
sniff at the area, but they simply 
whined in bewilderment and 
seemed to find no scent at all. A 
check via Ryder’s life-pulse ma- 
chine at the same spot evoked 
nothing but the faintest of pulsa- 
tions, those of the reeds them- 
selves. Unnerved more than he 
would admit by the incident, Nor- 
criss had suggested that Ryder lo- 
cate the missing animal so that — 
by a kind of proxy Contact — Nor- 
criss might delve into its mind and 
memories to ascertain what the 
source of its odd behavior might 
have been. When the machine 
found nothing a roborocket had 
been sent aloft, in case some un- 
explained planetary field might be 
distorting the beam from Ryder’s 



machine. Save for the two dogs 
still on hand (now kept aboard ship 
for safety), the roborocket’s tapes 
showed no dog in existence upon 
Rigel II. And even as Ryder had 
been finding this out one of the 
crewmen had spotted the missing 
animal, its fur wet and clotted with 
scum, moving over the surface of 
a distant islet in the swamp. Which 
was impossible. Roborockets 
didn’t make mistakes like that. 
Norcriss, more concerned than ev- 
er, had suggested that Ryder try 
the machine again, swirling the 
beam in the area where the dog 
had just been spotted. And the ma- 
chine reported nothing. 

“I’m sorry, sir,’’ said Ryder, 
turning from his machine. “The 
wolf-pulse gets no reaction, either. 
I’m afraid we’ll have to forget 
about the animal.’’ 

Norcriss, his tone just short of 
being sharp, said, “You know we 
can’t. Even if I check out the three 
species in question. Ensign, we 
have to know what’s happened to 
that dog. If a dog can go berserk 
on Rigel II we’re going to have to 
know the reasons. What can hap- 
pen to a dog can also happen to a 
man, Ensign.’’ 

Bob Ryder smiled, unruffled. 
He’d worked long enough with 
Norcriss to know that the latter’s 
ungenerous mood was the outward 
effect of underlying fear. On Rigel 
II Norcriss had every reason to 
fear non-return from Contact, 
more than on most planets. 



150 



IF 




“I know, sir,” Ryder said quiet- 
ly. “But there’s nothing we can do 
at the moment about the dog. Un- 
til we think up some new ideas—” 

He let the statement stand unfin- 
ished. The choice was up to Nor- 
criss. A zoologist had the option 
to refuse Learning a species where 
destruction was better than a 50/ 
50 certainty. 

Norcriss, however, nodded. 

“I may as well get with it,” 

He pivoted slightly on the edge 
of the couch and, lying back, ad- 
justed the helmet to his head and 
his body to the surface it would in- 
habit mindlessly for the next forty 
minutes. 

“Any time you’re ready,” he 
said and closed his eyes. 

Ryder put the life-pulse tape 
which the primal roborocket had 
garnered from Rigel II on the spin- 
dle and locked it into place. Then 
he hesitated. 

“With your permission, sir,” he 
said, pausing until Norcriss re- 
opened his eyes and cast him a 
quizzical glance, “I’ll choose the 
worst first. I figure that if you go 
through the two life-apathetic spe- 
cies right away the third Learning 
might be a bit easier on you — ” 

“Good. I thipk I’d rather do it 
that way, myself.” For a moment, 
his gaze locked with Ryder’s. 
“Thanks.” 

He closed his eyes again. Amid 
the burble and rustle and plash of 
the swamp, he heard the techni- 
cian’s hands making final adjust- 



ments upon the control board of 
the machine. Then his mind dis- 
solved into a flare of almost intol- 
erable white energies and — 

— he was in Contact. 

T HE creature in which he was 
hosted had its eyes open but for 
a dizzy moment Norcriss could 
not figure out what he was seeing 
or how. There seemed to be water 
and dull green grass everywhere, 
images overlapping without link- 
ing. He let his mind relax, then, let 
it reject its own preconceived no- 
tions of how-to-see, and allowed 
the “attitude” of the alien being to- 
ward sight convince his mind of the 
rightness of its alien method. And 
then he could see clearly. Directly 
ahead. In three different directions 
at once. 

He was bobbing on the restless 
surface of the swamp among a 
group his host recognized as simi- 
lar creatures. Well, that's a help 
... It was not always easy to guess 
at the appearance of an animal one 
enhosted, any more than a lone 
man without hands, arms or mir- 
ror could ascertain that he had 
purple-spotted earlobes or earlobes 
at all. But upon seeing the fellows 
of the creature he would be for 
forty minutes (although the time 
might be subjectively shorter or 
longer according to the host’s own 
time-sense), he knew what he him- 
self looked like. 

Like a pale-green apple pie, a 
nubbly-topped swollen disc bob-

bing on the swamp surface. But a 
stem of sorts grew upward from 
the top center of the pie and curled 
like a garden hose in an arc that 
took its invisible other end some- 
where below the surface of the al- 
gae-covered water. Near the base 
of that stem three subsidiary stalks 
jutted in triplicate symmetry hori- 
zontally, each terminating in a 
moist green globe, pea-sized, that 
was an eye. His initial confusion 
as to what he was seeing had been 
due to seeing in three ways at once: 
forward and slightly abaft of either 
side. But the beast itself seemed to 
have no notion of front or back or 
sideways. Anywhere it looked was 
its “only-direction.” Its spatial 
sense seemed limited to “where-I- 
am” and “where-everything-else- 
is.” 

How large an object he was at 
the moment he had no idea. But if 
the size of the coarse marsh grass 
were unvarying about the planet, 
he was roughly the diameter of a 
manhole-cover, and as tall — if such 
a squat creature could conceive 
such a dimension — as an average 
watermelon lying on the earth be- 
side its vine. 

Vine ... he repeated to himself, 
uneasily. For that was what the 
arcing hose-appendage reminded 
him most of. Yet the creature 
seemed to be animal, not plant. 

I wonder if it's ambulant . 

Asserting full control over the 
alien mind, he attempted to find 
out. Letting his own mind’s “leg- 



sense” take over, he tried to move 
from the spot where he floated. 
Around him, he saw the water be- 
gin to ripple as his host’s legs, or 
fins, or perhaps cilia, tried to move 
it. He found himself moving stead- 
ily along the surface of the water, 
while the other creatures sluggishly 
slid out of his path — and then lanc- 
ing pain seemed to tear at his 
mind’s “heart-sense” and he al- 
most passed out. 

Dazedly, he realized that the 
vine remained anchored at swamp- 
bottom somewhere and that its 
base was threatening to crack off. 
He groaned, managing to paddle 
or flit or ciliate back to the place 
from which he had started. This 
thing has no more true ambulance 
than a water-lily. Just so far , and 
then its life is ripped away . 

That it fed somehow upon nu- 
trients in the muck of the swamp- 
bottom he had no doubt now. 
Creeping unwanted into his mem- 
ory came the ecologists’ fear of 
this creature’s self-destructive na- 
ture. I wonder if a shift in the sea- 
sons or rising waters or some such 
m stimulus makes the things deliber- 
ately snap their life-stems off 

Resting after the short but ago- 
nizing ordeal, he once more stud- 
ied the fellow-creatures of his host. 
They bobbed at their stalks in 
placid contentment, either oblivi- 
ous or just bored about his brush 
with death. He had to admit to 
himself after what seemed an in- 
terminable interim of simply float-

IF 




ing in one spot: If they* re self-de- 
structive, I don't see how. None of 
them seems to have the pep to go 
and wrench the food-tube off at the 
stem . 

He stopped his introspection as 
the other members of the group 
abruptly began to splash and twirl 
in growing frenzy. Distantly — as 
though the nubbly surface of the 
alien were its “ears” — he heard 
something sloshing through the 
swamp. 

Hating to do it, he released most 
of his control upon the mind he in- 
habited. Until he was certain the 
thing was about to destroy itself it 
would be safer to let the alien take 
charge. It knew the emergency; he 
didn’t. Instantly his host began to 
churn the water and to spin in cir- 
cles about the end of the vine-thing 
to which it was attached. Norcriss 
could feel the torsion this contin- 
ued circling made in the stem, a 
feeling akin to having one’s flesh 
held between pincers and then 
twisted. Frightened, he grabbed 
control of the alien and stopped its 
thrashing. Alone amid its fellows 
his host bobbed unmoving. 

N ORCRISS saw the creature 
advancing over the murky wa- 
ters. Like a large anaconda with a 
double row of Fins running down 
its back in tapering heights, the 
thing glided through the reeds, 
some sort of froggish limbs near 
its neck and abdomen and just be- 
fore the tail tip propelling it hun- 



grily toward the cluster in which 
he hung, helpless, anchored to the 
life-giving vine. Its short, broad 
jaws gaped wide, exposing upper 
and lower rows of flat, incisor-like 
teeth, curved rather than pointed 
but apparently razor-sharp, like a 
scalloped edge on an aspirin-box. 
Not the sort of jaws that would do 
much damage to a human being — 
the teeth seemed chitinously flim- 
sy, not likely to penetrate flesh, 
bone or muscle — but certainly up 
to biting hunks from the pulpy, 
soft-crusted surface of his host. 

Swollen water-gray eyes saw the 
cluster and the beast opened its 
jaws even wider, hurrying its pace. 

A sharp, crackle, then another, 
drew Norcriss’ attention from the 
oncoming horror and let him wit- 
ness another one. On the rim of 
the cluster, one, then two, then five, 
then singly and in pairs, the fellow- 
aliens to his host were passing be- 
yond the torsion-limit of the food- 
tubes, and breaking free. The torn 
ends of the tubes puckered and 
spurted slimy yellow droplets for a 
dwindling moment, then fell into 
the water and vanished. And the 
attached aliens, ripped from the 
tubes, collapsed like riven mud- 
bubbles, turning from green to 
ashen gray and flattening until they 
lay almost paper-thin upon the 
water, the eye-stalks staring wildly 
until the last minute, then shrivel- 
ing into knotted gray stumps. 

And these deflated aliens the ad- 
vancing creature ignored. It slith-

ered between their flattened 
corpses, heading in unrelenting ser- 
pentine movement toward Nor- 
criss. He saw the gaping mouth, 
and knew that death was upon him. 
How much longer he could count 
on being enhosted he had no way 
of knowing. But death in that hun- 
gry mouth was a certainty, as far 
as its swiftness. Death by severance 
from the vine was slower, if only 
by seconds. Not letting himself 
think, Norcriss withdrew control, 
felt the host — free at last from the 
unaccountable immobility that had 
paralyzed its underlimbs — begin to 
backtrack in the water, tug at the 
vine. The vine splintered, frayed — 
Norcriss, in the voiceless host, 
gave a mental shriek of horror and 
incredible pain — and then he felt 
his host collapsing, dimly saw the 
severed vine spurting into the hu- 
mid air. Then his eyes curled up, 
his mind gave a despairing sob, 
and his urgent prayer for that sal- 
vational flare of mental lightning 
heralding the completion of the 
Contact went unanswered. Sudden- 
ly there was nothing to see, to 
think, to know. Norcriss was dead. 

O— ” CRIED RYDER as 
the dial fell abruptly to the 
zero calibration. He thumped it 
frantically, readjusted its sensitiv- 
ity, did everything he could to ne- 
gate the terrible message it wrote 
upon the face of the machine. Nor- 
criss had gone the way of so many 
zoologists before him. Trapped in 



an alien body when that body died, 
he had himself died. 

Numbly Ensign Bob Ryder 
turned to look at the silent form 
upon the couch. The motionless 
body that was only seemingly dead 
a moment before was now never 
going to move again. Ryder had 
always known in his heart that it 
might happen, but a kind of blind 
optimism had prevented him from 
ever letting himself believe that it 
actually would, someday, al- 
though statistics on the life-expec- 
tancy of Learners was a grim 
warning that the odds were all 
stacked against Norcriss from the 
day he became involved in his first 
Contact. 

One of the hovering crewmen, 
alerted by his despairing cry, spoke 
haltingly to Ryder. 

“Has it happened, sir?” 

Ryder, feeling too choked for a 
long explanation, just said, “Look 
for yourself,” and pointed at the 
dial. The man looked where Ry- 
der indicated and blinked in un- 
comprehension. 

“But it’s moving, sir,” he said. 

“What?” gasped Bob Ryder, 
spinning to look. The dial was in- 
deed creeping upward from the 
zero mark, slowly but steadily 
reaching the point where Norcriss’ 
mind, at whatever spot it might in- 
habit, would be attaining con- 
sciousness. 

“I’ll be damned!” said Ryder. 
“How the hell can he — ” 

A sputter and flare of electricity

IF 




interrupted him, and he saw with 
dismay that the tape-spool, on 
which the recorded life-pulse of the 
species under investigation lay, 
was doing an untoward shimmy. 
Ryder reached over and pulled it 
from the spindle before it could 
burst into flame. Once enhosted, 
Norcriss had no need of the tape, 
anyhow. Contact would go its im- 
mutable forty minutes and then 
return him to his own brain if tape, 
spool, machine, couch and helmet 
were wrecked. It was an electron- 
ically triggered power of the hu- 
man mind, an extension, boosted 
incredibly, of any person’s ability 
to “look at things from another’s 
point of view.” Once the tape-plus- 
machine-and-helmet had induced a 
zoologist’s mind to leap into an- 
other brain, the task of electronics 
was over, save for recording what 
had occurred. 

But the behavior of the tape was 
without precedent. 

Ryder looked at the tape he 
held, then at the dials on the face 
of the machine. “This is crazy!” 
he said, with a short laugh of be- 
wilderment. 

“What is, sir?” asked the crew- 
man, who had come nearer hope- 
fully upon seeing the motion on 
Norcriss’ own life-pulse dial. 

“I put in only the one tape,” 
said Ryder, scratching his head, 
“but Norcriss is now enhosted in 
the second of those self-destruc- 
tive species,” he murmured, vague- 
ly pointing to a waiting spool of 



roborocket tape, “the one I was 
going to feed into the machine 
next!” 

“How could that be, sir?” asked 
the man. 

“At the moment,” said Ryder, 
“nobody knows but Lieutenant 
Norcriss himself.” He stared at 
the machine, shaking his head. 

N ORCRISS returned to con- 
sciousness slowly, as one who 
rises from the depths of a dark well 
of ink, then was — with a shudder 
of memory — fully alert and over- 
whelmed with confusion. He knew 
he had been dead — or at least, as 
dead as his host had been — but 
now he was alive again. The phe- 
nomenon was beyond his compre- 
hension. Until he began looking 
about him. 

He was lying upon the slope of 
a rise of land, a part of his body 
still trailing in the swamp. A few 
of his fellow-aliens lay beside him 
but they no longer resembled 
themselves as he had last seen 
them. The flat, ashen-gray discs 
had curled at opposite edges, rolled 
themselves up, scroll-fashion, and 
become salami-sized gray slugs. 
As in most vermiform creatures, 
the alimentary canal proceeded 
from an orifice in the forward tip 
to an almost-identical orifice in 
the tip of the tail. The hollow pro- 
duced by the rolling-up of the flat 
gray disc was now serving as this 
canal, he realized. The shriveled 
eye-stalks, slowly bloating during 



LIFECYCLE 



155 




the long immersion in the water, 
were now studding the rim of the 
forward orifice, again in symmet- 
rically arranged position. The oth- 
er worm-things were munching at 
the muck upon the slope, and Nor- 
criss released control upon the 
alien mind to allow his host to join 
them. No telling how much of a 
strain the period of “death” had 
occasioned in the organism; im- 
mediate feeding might be a neces- 
sity for hanging on to the slender 
thread of life. 

What kind of metabolism does 
this thing have , anyhow? I've never 
seen anything on Earth like it . 
He checked the thought suddenly, 
realizing that it was untrue. Out in 
the swamp behind him and to both 
sides of where* his far end still 
trailed in the water, he saw some 
of the still-flattened “corpses” 
starting to curl their edges slowly 
in the sunlight, and knew what 
counterpart to their behavior he 
had seen on Earth, and seen often: 
Bananas and tomatos. Plucked un- 
ripe from their life-source, they 
should die, should remain unripe 
until they rotted. But they didn’t. 
Left in the sun, they continued to 
develop, independent of the parent- 
stem, the green flesh turning 
healthy yellow or flaming red, un- 
til ripe maturity was reached. 

If a plant can do it, there's no 
reason why this animal I'm Learn- 
ing can't, is there? I'm not sur- 
prised at the conduct of a banana 
or tomato, so I should have my 



head examined for being so 
shocked about this thing. At least 
I can give a positive report to the 
ecologists. This kind of species is 
anything but self-destructive. The 
roborocket just didn't recognize 
its new life-pulse as the met amor- 
phic state of the old one . 

With a hiss and flap of great 
wings, a large avian creature 
thumped to the earth at the top of 
the slope, its curving beak looking 
hungry to Norcriss’ instinctively 
chary gaze. It made no move to 
approach the slug-things on the 
slope, but the nearest of these 
ceased its mucky meal and began 
to hump and elongate its way up 
the rise of slick soil to the very 
claws of the waiting creature. 
Then, to Norcriss’ horror, the 
beaked avian bent, lifted the slug- 
tiling in its mouth and— head 
tilted well back — swallowed it in a 
single gulp. 

Oh damn, here I go again ... At 
the thought of being enhosted in 
yet another apparently self-de- 
stroying creature, Norcriss real- 
ized that this must be at least a 
roborocket-indistinguishable cous- 
in of that next alien he was to 
Learn. 

His companions were all gone 
now and the creature at the top of 
the slope was eyeing him expec- 
tantly. This, Norcriss realized, was 
not the time to loose the controls 
of his host. He could only hope 
that the worm-gobbling thing was 
inured to cooperation of its prey 



156 



IF 




to the point where it wouldn’t 
know what to do if one simply re- 
frained from offering itself as the 
blue-plate special. But the beaked 
monstrosity only waited for a lee- 
way of an apparent ten seconds be- 
fore it came waddling clumsily 
down the slick slope, beak open 
and ready for tenancy. A taloned 
claw slipped in the muck and the 
avian had to use its wings furious- 
ly to keep itself from an ungra- 
cious sprawl upon its splayed-out 
tailfeathers. 

Futilely, Norcriss tried to slith- 
er backward into the concealment 
of the swamp but his host didn’t 
seem to possess a “reverse” in its 
neuromotor arrangement. Then 
the great beak was pinching the 
soft flesh of his enhosted alien and, 
with a mental groan of despair, 
Norcriss felt the peristaltic action 
of the avian’s gullet pulling his 
temporary body toward death in 
its stomach — or in its crop, if its 
bird-resemblance went into that 
detail of nutrition. A bird that nev- 
er dined on nuts or kernels or hard 
items of aliment wouldn’t need a 
crop. 

His own lackadaisically clinical 
attitude toward sure disaster sud- 
denly surprised him. 

I'm either too numb from the 
last Learning to care or my host 
knows something I don't that gives 
it a confidence great enough for 
my mind to share . 

He felt no panic, no fear, only 
fatalistic resignation. As a welling- 



up of juices began to lave and 
prickle upon the tender flesh of his 
host, Norcriss sensed that his 
awareness was dimming in direct 
ratio to a sort of stiffening sensa- 
tion in the flesh. 

This time I am dying. I can feel 
nutrients from the flesh being 
leeched away by these juices , feel 
the remainder of my host growing 
tough and leathery , feel the tip-to- 
tip alimentary tube coiling into a 
sort of quivering nucleus . 

His mind tried to be afraid but 
two sessions of complete terror in 
one day were beyond it. 

I'm mentally anesthetized. I've 
‘died' already , today, and my mind 
is too weary to be scared now. So 
I'm drifting with the stream of my 
host's vanishing consciousness, 
knowing that what is happening is 
right and proper and not a cause 
for fear. Because . 

Then he had it. Norcriss knew 
why the ecologists were wrong. 
This creature was following 
through magnificently in its emula- 
tion of Earth-type plant life. Its 
secondary form was similar in 
function to that of any fruit on 
Earth: look attractive, and thus be 
devoured by animals, in order that 
the seeds — that leather-shelled “nu- 
cleus” in his host’s body — might 
be taken and left to take root in 
the carrier’s droppings. 

At least the tapes back at the 
ship will record the information for 
the ecologists. The two species 
aren't self-destructive. If anything.

they’re likely to outnumber the 
other species on the planet , in time 
— or their descendents will . 

Or would they? If one pie-thing 
became one worm-thing which be- 
came one seed, and that one seed 
grew only one pie-thing via the 
vine-tube, the race was static. 
Weakly, as his mind began to go, 
he gave a chuckle, realizing that 
the picture was complete: tulips 
behaved the same way. Destroy a 
tulip-bulb, and the world was per- 
manently short one tulip. Or was 
it? Norcriss was foggily trying to 
reassess what he knew about the 
sex-life of tulips when a shattering 
flare of whiteness blanketed his 
consciousness and — 

— Contact was over. 

N orcriss sat up on the 

couch and removed the helmet, 
brushing his thick pelt of starkly 
white hair from where the humid- 
ity had plastered it to his forehead. 
“Almost lost me that time,” he re- 
marked to Ensign Ryder. “Am I 
correct in assuming that I some- 
how went through a caterpillar-to- 
moth stage, Ensign?” 

Ryder nodded. “You’ve 
squeezed both species into the one 
forty-minute period, sir. It’s un- 
precedented.” 

“And damned lucky,” said Nor- 
criss. “That second species, as far 
as I can guess, has a life-expec- 
tancy of roughly three minutes. If 
I hadn’t been nearly through the 
forty I wouldn’t be here, now.” 



“Are you game for the last one, 
sir?” asked Ryder, his fingers toy- 
ing with the rim of a tape-spool 
containing that third, and wildly 
incomprehensible, species that 
seemed to have an incredible lack 
of self-knowledge. Numerically, 
the roborocket had reported the 
third species as being less than a 
thousand, planet-wide. The Con- 
tact helmet, while not selective 
among a particular species — that 
is, one could not aim for a specific 
member of a species — would per- 
force send Norcriss’ mind into the 
nearest of that species. For that 
reason it was dangerous for crew- 
men to attack any of the local 
fauna when the zoologist was 
Learning. As long as they did not 
know the appearance of the crea- 
ture he might be inhabiting they 
dared not kill any while his body 
lay helpless upon the couch. Nor- 
criss, naturally, would steer it 
clear of the ship when he was in 
control; but this would not always 
be possible. If, for instance, he had 
to flee a predator in his alien body, 
flight in the ship’s vicinity might be 
unavoidable. So at Ryder’s query, 
his nod was only half-hearted. 

“Here’s hoping I don’t wind up 
in a bull-alligator-type of alien,” 
he said, “and blunder past a trig- 
ger-happy crewman.” 

Ryder laughed. The crew was 
hand-picked not to be given to act- 
ing without thought. In the mili- 
tary instant and unthinking obedi- 
ence was a necessity — except in the 



158 



IF 




crew of a space zoologist’s craft. 
There only men who used their 
minds were welcome. It made for 
rather relaxed discipline, aboard 
ship but it brought a lot of zoolo- 
gists home alive. 

“All right, then, sir. The tape’s 
in place,” Ryder announced a mo- 
ment later. Norcriss lay back and 
— as usual — was in Contact before 
his ears could register the click of 
the switch Ryder’s deft fingers 
threw. 

Damn it— damn it to hell . 

His tactile sensations were sink- 
ing slowly into his mind and the in- 
formation he was absorbing was 
familiar. Back in his training days, 
the Learning of Earth-indigenous 
species was part of the course, and 
a good zoologist never forgot a 
host. 

Vm a dog. I know this feeling , 
the paw-touch on the earth , the 
panting , the fur , the tongue , nose, 
drooping ears . 

He was on dry land but soon had 
trotted over to the rim of the 
swamp and studied his reflection in 
an algae-free patch of murky wa- 
ter. 

And unless I miss my guess, Vm 
that hound we lost right after the 
landing . 

The situation was incredible. 
The tape Ryder had put into the 
machine should have catapulted his 
mind into an alien body. What it 
was doing in this hound? 

Puzzled, Norcriss withdrew con- 
trol for a moment or two. Free of 



interference, the animal romped 
about a bit on the hummock, 
sniffed along the ground, lay down 
and panted in contentment, 
twitched its tail back and forth — 
in short, behaved exactly as a 
hound was supposed to. 

I dont get it. But if Ryder or 
the machine has made some error 
I ought to take advantage of it and 
get this critter back to the ship . 

A few steps around the hum- 
mock, head held high, were enough 
to bring to his sight the gleaming 
needle that was the nose of the 
spaceship. After a careful look 
around him for possible menaces 
to life and limb, Norcriss guided 
his recontrolled host into the swirl- 
ing swamp waters and began to 
swim it through the intervening 
reeds toward the waiting ship. It 
gave him a peculiar sensation, as 
always, to observe his own body 
lying on the couch near the hatch 
of the ship, to see Ryder standing 
dutifully before the towering face 
of the Contact machine, keeping 
an alert eye on the indicators — to 
see the crew standing and chatting 
idly at the site where his body lay 
in comatose rigidity. Clambering 
up onto the shore amid the reeds, 
Norcriss decided once again to re- 
linquish control, to let the animal’s 
natural instincts take it up to romp 
with the crewmen it had come to 
know during its exercise periods 
aboard ship. And as he let go — 

— hate, vicious, mindless hate 
and icy fear gripped his host. The 



LIFECYCLE 



159 




dog-body, no longer carefree of 
movement, dropped into conceal- 
ment behind the reeds and Nor- 
criss felt as though the feet were 
somehow bogging down into glu- 
tinous mire. The fear that his host 
might have blundered into quick- 
sand made him take control once 
more and he strenuously tried to 
extricate his feet from whatever 
they were imbedded in. With a 
sucking sensation, a sort of slip- 
pery resistance, he felt one, then 
another, then all the feet come 
free. 

But the hound’s body had not 
moved. 

A glance downward showed the 
paws precisely where they had been. 
And they were enmired in nothing. 
Just slightly dampened from the 
swim across the shallow swamp, 
the paws lay upon dry, sunlit land. 

But they feel free . 

Tentatively he wiggled a foot, 
wiggled all four — wiggled all six — 
Startled, Norcriss let go of the 
alien mind with his own — and the 
hound was suddenly gone. He was 
looking down upon its sprawled 
body, now, the tongue lolling out 
of the sagging mouth. He was on 
the surface of a crusty tree, feel- 
ing the searing heat of the sunlight 
as painfully as if he had been 
thrown into a furnace. 

Of his host he could see nothing 
but the distorted shadow the trunk 
of the tree but it told him enough 
to let him guess the rest. 

The shadow was serpentine, yet 



possessed of a sextet of limbs and 
twin ridges along the topside of the 
spine. He was a puny-sized version 
— probably a fairly newborn — of 
that pie-hungry creature from his 
first Contact. He knew now what 
had happened to the hound. Drawn 
to the reeds by the scent of an un- 
familiar animal, it had been easy 
prey for the snake-thing, small as 
it was. A flip of those limbs had 
sent it, faster than canine reflex, 
into the mouth of the hound, 
whereat it had disported its limbs 
into the very nerves and arteries of 
the hapless creature, in effect be - 
coming the creature. It was doing 
physically what he himself did via 
Contact. The young of the swamp- 
snake could not withstand direct 
sunlight. They lay hidden in the 
shadows, or under the water, or in- 
side — physically inside — the brain 
of another creature. It was no won- 
der they lacked self-awareness. To 
spend most of one’s life under a 
variety of other-animal forms, a 
species would be hard put to main- 
tain a sense of its own ancestry. It 
would have no standard behavior- 
patterns for the roborockets sensi- 
tive instruments to record. It 
would come across as a cipher, 
like a vote of “undecided” in a na- 
tional poll. 

My brain is frying . 

Taken up by his own thoughts, 
he hadn’t noticed the slow soften- 
ing of his limbs where they gripped 
the trunk. The flesh was growing

66 OOD luck,” everyone had 

vJsaid. “Good luck, good 
luck.” He did not believe in luck 
and never had. He believed in hard 
work and the theory of probabil- 
ity, necessarily in that order. 
“Good luck — good luck, Ed.” 

Outside the corridors had been 
a bedlam. Here in the chamber 
everything was hushed, sedate. The 
Senator in the center, who chewed 
tobacco and called square dances 
when he was electioneering in his 
home state, believed in dignity and 
decorum for these hearings. Even 
the television technicians were 
quiet, going about their wire 
stringing like so many laboring 
spiders in the eaves of an old barn. 
The audience was funeral. 

They're frightened to death of 
being thrown out. This is the big 
day of the hearings. The day / go 
on the stand . 

He sat down between the com- 
pany’s attorneys. 

One of them touched his hand 
lightly and said, “We’ll make it, 
Ed.” 

Without thinking he said, “ Wish 
me luck." 

Both of them said, “Good luck 
— ” solemnly. 

The hush deepened. A red light 
on one of the TV cameras came 
on and the Senator in the center 
rapped his gavel for orders 

“These hearings are now in ses- 
sion,” he said. 

He had a dry, colorless voice — 
like an old law clerk’s. 



“As I do at the beginning of 
every session, I wish to remind 
you that these proceedings do not 
constitute a trial. This is merely 
the Senate’s means of informing 
itself. Although anyone appearing 
here may have legal counsel if he 
so desires, any quibbling will be 
disposed of in short order by my 
colleagues and myself. 

“Most of you are doubtless 
aware of the subject of these hear-

tice initiated by one of this na- 
tion’s largest manufacturers of 
digital computers — a firm which 
also happens to be fast becoming 
one of our largest vendors of com- 
puter services. Many of the wit- 
nesses who have appeared before 
this committee believed that the 
economic life of our country is 
gravely endangered by this com- 
pany’s business practices. It is no 
secret that many people in the 
news media agree with them.” 

The Senator on the right inter- 
rupted to say, “A great many peo- 
ple consider the practice immor- 
al,” and the Senator in the center 
nodded sagely. 

“During our last session we 
heard from a representative of the 
American bar and from the presi- 
dents of the chambers of com- 
merce of the cities of Las Vegas 
and Reno. Today — ” 

He paused to whisper to the 
chief counsel of the committee. 

The chief counsel said, “Call 
Madame Felice Dubois.”

A slender woman who seemed 
literally to shimmer with chic 
stood up and glided toward the 
witness box. 

The counsel asked her, “You 
are Felice Dubois, a leading cou- 
turiere, with salons in Washington, 
New York, Los Angeles, London, 
and Paris — is that correct?” 

She nodded almost impercepti- 
bly. “It is.” 

“Do you wish to make a state- 
ment to the committee?*’ 

The woman’s laugh was a quick 
succession of notes struck on plat- 
inum bells. 

“I should really like to make 
several. I would need them to tell 
you all that has been done.” 

“One statement will be suffic- 
ient,” the Senator in the center 
said. 

“Let me make an obvious one 
then — about wedding gowns. Our 
art has given these great study re- 
cently— long-skirted, short- or 
miniskirted, even the bare midriff 
and see-through. Most of all we 
have given thought to the succes- 
sion of gowns proper in so-called 
serial marriages. Our economy 
has come to depend on people’s 
marrying more than once. Our in- 
dustry has promoted certain col- 
ors — white first, of course. For 
second marriages, some shade of 
blue — then peach or pink, then 
pastel green and so on. We are not 
quite in agreement for the fifth — 
but it is of little importance. By 
then we’re willing to compete. But 



we’ve invested a great deal of 
money in promotion and — ” 

“And what has been the effect 
of the business practice under in- 
vestigation here?” 

“Disaster! Only two years ago, 
you comprehend, a third of all 
marriages ended in divorce, the 
cultured classes averaging higher, 
of course. Of those who were di- 
vorced — ” 

The Senator rapped with his 
gavel. “We heard the statistics 
yesterday at some length, ma- 
dam.” Evidently the testimony at 
this point was not going exactly as 
he had anticipated. “What has 
been the effect on other areas of 
your business?” 

Madame Dubois was subdued 
now. 

“A good deal of money spent 
by women in our industry has 
been removed from circulation. 
The divorcee, as a class, you know 
— was much interested haute cou- 
ture — ” 

“I believe that will be suffi- 
cient,” the Senator in the center 
said. “Unless my colleagues have 
some questions for you, you may 
step down.” 

The woman waited for a mo- 
ment, then left the box, making 
her way gracefully back to her 
seat. In a whisper picked up by 
one of the PA microphones the 
Senator in the center asked the 
chief counsel, “It’s that psycholo- 
gist fellow next, isn’t it?” 

“Call Dr. Claude Honnicker.” 



OF RELAYS AND ROSES 



163 




H E WAS a tall, spare man in a 
dark suit. He wore ordinary, 
black-rimmed glasses but by some 
trick of mannerism he wore them 
as if they were pince-nez. 

The chief counsel identified him 
as a specialist in industrial psy- 
chology who operated a placement 
agency exclusively for upper eche- 
lon executives and scientists. He 
was given the same invitation to 
speak which had been tendered 
Madame Dubois. 

“If you don’t mind,” he replied 
in a precise voice, “I should prefer 
to be questioned directly. A gen- 
eral statement might be subject to 
misinterpretation.” 

“Very well then. In your exper- 
ience is there a diminished supply 
of the men in whose services you 
deal?” 

“Unquestionably. As compared 
to a similar period a year ago it 
is down seventeen per cent. As 
compared to two years past, 
twenty-two per cent. That is a very 
serious decrease and I have reason 
to believe that this — uh — this mat- 
rimonial service is largely respon- 
sible.” 

“And will you explain — or can 
you explain — how something we 
have all been led to believe is no 
more than a computerized — in 
your own phrase, matrimonial ser- 
vice — could lead to this short- 
age?” 

“I shall try. In my opinion our 
own country and every other ad- 
vanced country in the world is 



heavily dependent, upon a certain 
type of man. This man may be an 
executive, a scientist, a general or 
a coal miner — but he is the man 
who works harder than there is 
any immediate need for him to 
work and harder than any of the 
incentives offered him by society 
justify. He does this because work 
offers him an outlet for the ten- 
sions a hostile environment have 
built up in him and society ex- 
ploits him to its benefit.” 

“You make him sound like an 
alcoholic,” the senator on the 
right said. 

“Frankly — ” Dr. Honnicker 
shifted in his seat — “such men 
fairly frequently become alcohol- 
ics. Particularly the sales man- 
agers, advertising men and other 
extroverted types. The introverts 
— scientists, . for example — may 
tend toward paranoia eventually.” 
“Then you believe that the com- 
puter service we have been discus- 
sing actually benefits these peo- 
ple?” 

“To the detriment of society as 
a whole — yes. The question is: 
How much can society stand? 
There are indications that it can- 
not take much more.” 

“In other words a great number 
of our most productive people 
have stopped producing.” 

Dr. Honnicker nodded. “In a 
certain sense — that is literally 
true.” 

“The Senator on the left asked, 
“In you opinion has this effected 



164 



IF 




labor— I mean the officers of 
American unions— to the same de- 
gree that it has managerial exec- 
utives?” 

”1 cannot answer that from cer- 
tain knowledge but I doubt it. Im- 
portant union leaders tend to be 
older than the hardest hit group. 
The problem has struck most di- 
rectly at the sort of men who have 
postponed marriage for reasons of 
career. This is the rising genera- 
tion upon whom we depend. I 
might add that in my experience 
men who have already made a rea- 
sonably successful match have not 
tended to subscribe.” 

There was a long silence. 

Then the Senator in the center 
said, “I think that will be all.” 

The chief counsel announced, 
“Call Mr. Edward Teal Smithe.” 

* 

H E HAD been waiting for it. 

He put hands flat on the table 
in front of him to raise himself to 
a standing position. 

“Take the stand please.” 

He slipped into the aisle and 
walked up to the witness box. It 
was as though he were walking 
through the pews in church again 
— the feeling came back across all 
the years. He had felt then that he 
was somehow ridiculous and that 
the people were snickering as he 
passed. Wanting to turn back and 
see, he did not. The witness chair 
was of hard oak, like a school 
chair. 

“You are the vice president in 



charge of your company’s oper- 
ations? Did I understand your title 
correctly?” 

The first part, the formalities, 
had flitted past while he had been 
in a sort of waking dream. Men- 
tally he shook himself, tried to be- 
lieve that this was no more fright- 
ening than a board meeting. 

“Yes. Operations as differenti- 
ated, for example, from sales or 
research.” 

“It is your department that of- 
fers the public the service to which 
we have been alluding?” 

“Yes.” 

“But I believe you have stated 
to the press that you yourself did 
not originate the concept of such 
a service.” 

Tom Larkin had come in- 
to his office. Tom was tall 
and intense and wore a shop 
coat, often, when he lunched 
with the Old Man — an un- 
heard-of thing. He had 
thrown himself into one of 
the free-form chairs and an- 
nounced, “I’ve got some- 
thing.” Tom was in the Car- 
ibbean somewhere now, 
damn him. 

Ed had not said, Execu- 
tive's Itchl as Tom himself 
might have ynder reversed 
circumstances. He had not 
felt up to it. 

He had merely grunted, 

“Oh?” 

“Something that will 



OF RELAYS AND ROSES 



165 




make this company ten for- 
tunes.” 

“We need it. We just lost 
a government contract.” 
“I’m aware of that. 
What’s the greatest strength 
of our Mark XX digital?” 

Ed had sighed. “Data 
storage capacity. With the 
ability to read an alteration 
in a single molecule as a bi- 
nary digit the Mark XX can 
put more information in a 
hockey puck than most oth- 
er machines can in a mem- 
ory bank as big as Long Is- 
land. You worked it out. 
You don’t need lessons from 
me. 

The Senator in the center asked, 
“Aren’t you going to reply, Mr. 
Smithe?” 

“I wasn’t aware that your state- 
ment required answer. No, I did 
not originate the concept. You 
were also correct in stating that I 
have so declared in the past.” 
“Would you explain to this 
committee just how your service 
operates, please?” 

“From the viewpoint of the cus- 
tomer? A person wishes to make 
an ideal matrimonial liaison with 
another. Computers have been 
used for this in the past, usually 
on college campuses or by semi- 
serious entrepreneurs with inade- 
quate machines and facilities.” 
“Your program is different?” 
“Our company has evolved a 
computer capable of absorbing a 

166 



truly vast number of facts and a 
program which permits us to enter 
almost anything as datum with the 
assurance that irrelevancies will be 
canceled out and that we will be 
notified of any discrepancies. We 
put this at our client’s disposal.” 
“And from this hodgepodge the 
machine can select a suitable wife 
for a man or a husband for a wo- 
man? Unerringly? I find that in- 
credible.” 

“So did I at one time. As for 
our percentage of error — we seem 
to have attracted attention by not 
erring.” 

He had read his morning 
paper, as he always did, in 
the coffee shop of the resi- 
dential hotel in which he 
lived. The story was on the 
front page, unmissable. Be- 
ing a thorough man he read 
it from beginning to end be- 
fore he finished breakfast 
and also the editorial it had 
inspired. Then he had taken 
a taxi to the plant and, with- 
out stopping to hang up his 
hat in his own suite had gone 
to Tom’s office. 

Tom had said, “You’ve 
seen it. Wild, isn’t it?” 

“It’s absurd and fantastic. 
According to this you told 
some young man that he 
would find his beloved — 
that’s what it says — in an 
obscure village in Ethiopia. 
He sold everything he had, 
bought a ticket on a jet and 

IF 




he and the girl are now mar- 
ried and ecstatically happy.” 
“The story was wrong. He 
didn’t sell anything. If we 
could give him all that free 
computer time under the 
tryout program I saw no 
reason not to give him a 
plane ride, too — it was far 
less expensive. Round trip 
for him to Ethiopia, one 
way for the girl back. It in- 
creased his confidence.” 

441V/TR. SMITHE,” the Sena- 
^▼^tor on the right said, 
“don’t you feel that you are treat- 
ing your computer as an oracle?” 
“No, I don’t. Laymen often do 
so, I admit. We’ve done everything 
in our power to counter that im- 
pression. Do you remember the 
man who went to Ethiopia? It was 
the first case that was played up 
by the news media and it did a lot 
to confuse things.” 

The Senator in the center said, 
“I remember the case well. It 
did a lot to confuse things.” 

The Senator in the center said, 
“I remember the case well. It 
seemed almost miraculous.” 

“The man in question was an 
intelligent young Negro. He had 
volunteered for the service while 
we were still trying to get it out of 
the egg, so to speak. We gave him 
extensive psychological tests, fed 
the results to the computer and 
then gave the new tests it recom- 
mended. A fantastic number of 
hours of machine time were re- 

OF RELAYS AND ROSES 



quired then, but Tom Larkin, who 
is our vice president for research 
and the real instigator of the ser- 
vice, had faith in it.” 

“And what, in the opinion of the 
computer, did the tests show?’’ 
“Well, for one thing, the young 
man was intensely interested in 
Coptic Christianity. The Mark 
XX felt someone of his own faith 
would make the best partner for 
him. It also found that since he 
had spent his early childhood in a 
rural area and reacted unfavor- 
ably to urban life when his family 
moved to the city, a girl from a 
semi-rural, rather isolated locale 
would suit him best. In this coun- 
try there are very few Coptic 
Christians in isolated areas. In 
Ethiopia Coptic Christianity is the 
state religion and there are a great 
many. This is simplified, natur- 
ally — but you see the approach. 
Thousands of other correlations 
like this were made before the 
specific girl was selected.” 

“The newspapers make your 
Mark XX sound like a pythoness 
but now you’re making it sound 
as if it’s only someone’s wise old 
tin grandmother, Mr. Smithe.” 
“It’s neither. It is a machine for 
manipulating data. Senator, may 
I say something that’s been on my 
mind for a long time?” 

“Please do. That’s what we’re 
here for.” 

“As I’ve said, all of us in the 
computer industry have fought the 
public desire to make something 
supernatural of our machines. But 

167 




there is one way in whicji the pub- 
lic’s misconception is useful. It of- 
ten makes people do the logical 
thing when the logical thing is 
something that would be called 
silly if it were suggested from an- 
other source. If a town stood on 
the slope of a dormant volcano 
and the volcano started to rumble 
and smoke, a lot of the people 
might not want to leave. Because, 
after all, the volcano had never 
erupted before — at least as far as 
their knowledge went. But if a 
computer told them it was prudent 
to move they probably would. It 
may be that the man in the street 
is right to be a bit awed. If awe 
impels a man to follow a logical 
course of action — then awe has its 
uses. I’ve noticed that the comman 
man is often most right when he 
seems most wrong.” 

“That was quite a speech, Mr. 
Smithe,” the Senator said dryly. 
“My impression is today that the 
man in the street believes his 
country’s going to the dogs, and I 
understand from some of the testi- 
mony we heard yesterday that the 
company you represent has of- 
fered your marriage-broking ser- 
vice — I think I can call it that — to 
more than a hundred thousand 
Americans without fee. Do you 
have any comment on the last?” 

F ROM the first word he had 
known a sick and sinking 
feeling. There had been a ring in 
the Senator’s voice that suggested. 



he stood tried and condemned — of 
what? Something sneaky and per- 
haps un-American? “You see, 
Senator,” he began, “when Mr. 
Larkin persuaded our president to 
put the service on the market — ” 

The service hadn’t been 
much of a success. Oh, it 
succeeded in satisfying cus- 
tomers — it became better 
and better and processing re- 
quired less time with every 
new client. But there hadn’t 
been enough clients. Not 
nearly enough. 

They had all been called 
into the Old Man’s confer- 
ence room that day and 
there wasn’t a one of them 
— himself from Operations, 
Larkin from Research, rep- 
resentatives from Sales, 
Advertising, and Manufac- 
turing — who hadn’t know 
what was coming. 

The president, the Old 
Man, never tore into any- 
one; that was part of his 
charm and his effectiveness. 
He always spoke logically 
and fairly and when he could 
give the man on the carpet 
the benefit of the doubt he 
gave it. But he always had 
the facts. 

“Mr. Larkin,” he had said 
slowly, “I know you remem- 
ber the meeting at which it 
was decided to put this ex- 
periment of yours on a corn- 



168 



IF 




mercial basis. I had almost 
said, ‘it was voted,’ but you 
will also recall, I think, that 
only you and I voted in fa- 
vor. So we did it anyway.” 
Tom had said he would 
never forget that. 

“But we are losing mon- 
ey on it. The sales curve for 
— what do you call it?” 
“Program Roses.” 

“For Program Roses has 
been nearly flat and recently, 
in fact, has started slanting 
downward. Roses is in the 
red and I’ll tell you frankly 
that if the rest of our bus- 
iness were not experiencing 
a goodish upturn we 
wouldn’t have been able to 
carry it this long. Can you 
give me any reason why Pro- 
gram Roses should not be 
terminated?” 

The Senator interrupted. “From 
all you’ve said, Mr. Smithe, it 
seems to me your company should 
have sent Mr. Larkin to testify be- 
fore this committee instead of 
yourself.” 

“We wanted to,” Ed said, “but 
he couldn’t be reached.” 

“Couldn’t be reached?” 

“You see, he himself eventually 
subscribed. He and his bride are 
taking a six-month honeymoon in 
a sloop. Tom’s always been quite 
a sailor in his spare time, and as it 
turned out the girl Roses picked 
for him is, too.” 



“Did you say six months?” The 
Senator sounded incredulous. 

“With pay. Our president didn’t 
want to let him have more than 
three but Tom threatened to 
quit.” 

“It would seem — ” the Senator 
was smiling coldly — “that you 
have been victimized by your own 
cleverness.” 

“We don’t think so. You see — ” 

Tom had waited until the 
Old Man was finished before 
he exploded his bombshell. 
Until he was finished and 
there been a long, pregnant 
pause. Then he hadn’t ad- 
dressed the president direct- 
ly; he appeared to speak to 
Sales: “I don’t want Roses 
discontinued — it’s the best 
thing we’ve got. I want to 
give it away.” 

No one had spoken. Ed 
remembered that he himself 
had known a sick realization 
that Tom had cracked up at 
last. 

“Roses,” Tom had an- 
nounced, “has already 
brought us three million in 
new contracts and accounts. 
You don’t charge people to 
read your advertising, do 
you? They might be willing 
to pay — some who are inter- 
ested enough — but you 
make more money when it’s 
free.” 



OF RELAYS AND ROSES 



169 




Sales had said slowly, 
“He’s right. He and I have 
combed through the new ac- 
counts one by one, and in 
ninety per cent of the cases 
we’ve found that the decision 
to swing the business to us 
was either made or strongly 
influenced by someone 
who’d be a client for 
Roses.’’ 

The Senator in the center 
cleared his throat. “You mean to 
sit there and tell us that Roses is 
just a sales gimmick for the rest 
of your business?’’ 

“A gimmick,’’ Ed Smithe said, 
“is when you give away a plastic 
bathtub toy with a box of break- 
fast cereal. And that brings us to 
something else Tom made us rea- 
lize. Roses not only made these 
key people familiar with our ma- 
chines and impressed with them — 
it also made the Mark XX a per- 
manent part of their lives. The 
competition has found that it can 
talk a long time and not erase 
that.’’ 

“And so you have actually of- 
fered the service free.’’ 

“To people who we feel will be 
in a position to specify computers 
or computer services as part of 
their careers — yes.’’ 

T HERE was a stir in the cham- 
ber. The Senator said heavily, 
“You seem to be destroying the 



fabric of society as a sort of side 
effect.’’ 

“Not really.’’ Ed drew a deep 
breath. “Senator, who’s the better 
farmer, the man who hitches up 
his tractor and runs it until it 
breaks or the man who oils and 
services it and lets it cool off if the 
engine overheats? And who gets 
more plowing down in the long 
run? These men and women who 
have lived half their lives in lone- 
liness are often thrown off balance 
temporarily when they finally find 
someone with whom they can re- 
late, I admit. Sometimes they just 
want to quit — to be with their new 
partner every hour. But eventually 
they come back — and when they 
do they’re working for something, 
not just to get away from some- 
thing. Right now we’re in the 
trough — the service has been 
building rapidly and a majority of 
our clients are still in the honey- 
moon stage. But the earlier ones 
are coming back stronger than 
ever and I can prove it.’’ 

He did. The charts and slides 
helped but the facts really spoke 
for themselves. Numbers of theses 
written, numbers of patents 
granted, earnings of firms whose 
executive ranks were heavy with 
early clients. He was no salesman 
but he could feel the whole cham- 
ber swinging over; it thrilled him. 

When he finished he was wrung 
out. His shirt was sticking to his 
chest and his legs felt weak. But

seen it immediately!” He swung 
around and looked at the icy river 
that coursed through the cell. “The 
symptoms are obvious! Copper or 
zinc! And it wasn’t zinc that poi- 
soned him. Come along, Morgan.” 
And with that, he strode ponder- 
ously into the stream, pushing his 
way through the icy water with the 
determination of a destroyer. 

Morgan, just stared until the 
water had reached Mikko’s chest, 
then he said: “Are you crazy, 
Mikko? You’ll freeze your — ” 
“Come along!” Mikko roared. 
‘‘Do you think I’m enjoying this?” 
Morgan paused, took a deep 
breath, and waded resolutely into 
the icy stream. After three gasps 
he finally got his voice back. 
‘‘Wha — what am I missing?” 
“Copper,” Mikko said grimly, 
forging ahead. “That man died of 
copper poisoning. From the food? 
Hardly likely. He was ill before he 
ate any of that nauseating concoc- 
tion. He drank water. This water.” 
Morgan would have slapped his 
own head if he’d been less busy. 
“Oh, hell, yes,” he said bitterly. 
“I bow to a superior brain. Cop- 
per sulfate. Iron’s higher in the 
electromotive series. I feel stupid.” 
“I feel cold,” Mikko said, reach- 
ing out one hand to grasp the grill 
of iron bars. The water was just 
above his navel. “Let’s test our 
hypothesis.” 

He stooped down, grasped one 
of the bars with a powerful hand 



( Continued from page 51) 
and pulled. It snapped off some 
centimeters below the water line. 

The bars had lost their iron. In 
the decades that they had been 
washed by the copper sulfate so- 
lution. Elementary chemistry: Me- 
tallic iron plus copper sulfate yields 
metallic copper plus iron sulfate. 
But the copper that replaces the 
iron is porous, spongy, and weak. 

Morgan grasped another bar 
and jerked it loose, trying to ig- 
nore the frigid chill of the water 
and the fact that both of them 
would have to duck completely 
under to get through the opening 
they were making. 

“Just think,” he growled, “that 
poor mother died of copper poi- 
soning when there was a way out 
all the time.” 

Mikko grunted. “He didn’t die 
of copper poisoning; he died of 
ignorance.” 



M R. GOODBIT stepped out of 
his aircar and stood, hands 
clasped in the small of his back, 
staring at the Peccavi. “Most sus- 
picious,” he decided after a min- 
ute’s contemplation. “Notice the 
craft doesn’t seem to be insured in 
the slightest.” 

Richtman nodded his agreement, 
hopping nervously from foot to 
foot. “They said a cloud of smoke 
came up from the ship shortly af- 
ter they got here but it didn’t do 



FIMBULSOMMER

any damage. I think it’s a trick.” 

“Possible, certainly possible. Al- 
though it is unclear exactly what 
sort of trick. Where is this hole 
you say appeared in the hull?” 

The group leader pointed. 
“About there. Midway up the side. 
You can just make out the outline 
with an optical scanner.” 

“Very good. Break out a high 
explosive grenade and load it into 
the launcher. Put it on automatic, 
so if that port opens again it will 
lob the missile inside.” 

“Do you think they’re on to 
us?” Richtman asked. 

Goodbit shrugged. “Why take 
any chances? They seem to be 
snooping. That is something we 
cannot afford.” 

“You think they’ve found any- 
thing out yet?” 

Something moved next to Good- 
bit’s foot. Without taking his eyes 
off the ship, he squashed it under 
his heel. “Perhaps they have. They 
couldn’t have completed their 
snooping or the ship wouldn’t be 
sitting here. We must stop it from 
leaving.” 

“Yes, but what do you think 
that black thing that flew in the 
hatch was? Some sort of spy de- 
vice?” 

Goodbit glared at his minion. 
“You’re beginning to babble. 
Don’t get nervous. Whatever it is, 
it’s something that high explosive 
will destroy. That hatch will open 
again. When it does, it won’t 
close.” 



T HE outer door of the long-de- 
serted contemplation cell was 
not locked. It had been smashed 
long before, its primitive mechan- 
ism broken. Morgan Oxbo, using 
one finger, eased it open. 

There might — just might — be 
one of the locals on the other side 
of it. 

But there wasn’t. A set of stone 
steps led upward to the surface. 
Obiously, the vine-covered light 
slits were at ground level, with 
most of the contemplation cell un- 
derground. At the top of the stairs 
were the remnants of what had 
once been a wooden, iron-bound 
door. It, too, had been smashed 
long ago and had been decaying 
ever since. 

A gust of warm air swept down 
as Morgan swung the door wide. 
Except for plant life, no living thing 
was in sight.. 

Two chilled, wet men crept cau- 
tiously up the stairway. 

Morgan peered over the broken, 
rotting boards, took a long look 
around, then glared back down at 
Mikko. 

“I thought you said this place 
was five kilometers out of the vil- 
lage,” he whispered. 

“No,” Mikko corrected. “I said 
that' on the planet now inhabited 
by the Brotherhood the contem- 
plation cell was five kilos away. I 
am not responsible for changes in 
design. I take it that we are within 
the village?” 

“Apparently. Take a look.”

IF 




“Indeed,” said Mikko after a 
full minute of observation. “If my 
memory of our survey serves me 
— and it does — we are approxi- 
mately seven hundred and fifty me- 
ters from the village square. I sug- 
gest we proceed with the utmost 
caution.” 

“Agreed,” Morgan said. He 
stepped into the alleyway, which 
was cobblestoned and covered with 
a mosslike overgrowth. “Frankly,” 
he muttered, “I feel naked without 
my instruments.” 

“You look it,” Mikko growled. 
“Well, you aren’t the prettiest 
nude I've ever seen, either.” 

“May I say that your figure also 
would be clearly enhanced by ele- 
gant clothing — or any other meth- 
od of concealing it. Shall we go?” 
The street was overgrown with 
purple-green vegetation that 
reached, in places, up to their 
waists. Morgan avoided the thick 
patches with innate distaste, while 
Mikko plunged straight forward 
with a disdain for anything merely 
vegetable. They both moved silent- 
ly and stayed beneath the overhang 
of the aging stone walls as much 
as possible, keeping vigilant eyes 
on the roofs. The buildings at the 
edge of town were spaced well 
apart, and the two men darted 
from house to house like a pair of 
pink mice in a bakery. 

“Drop,” Mikko barked, falling 
flat and rolling into a thicket of 
leafy bushes. Morgan dived for 
the shadow of a time-twisted board 



fence. They lay motionless while 
an aircar hissed by some hundred 
meters to their left and fifty meters 
over the village. 

After a minute Morgan eased 
himself to a kneeling position, star- 
ing over the houses beyond which 
the aircar had disappeared. 
“Landed in the square, apparently. 
Fun and games at the ship. I hope 
Metrak is back.” 

“Damn!” Mikko snarled vi- 
ciously. 

“Trouble?” 

“This bush is full of thorns.” 
Mikko rose gingerly and stepped 
away from the offending flora. 
“I’m as full of pricks as a pud- 
ding.” 

“Are you all right?” Morgan 
asked with quick concern. 

“Unless they were tipped with 
cyanide, I am,” Mikko said. 

“I’ve had my shots.” 

“Can you walk?” 

“Walk, run, or wrestle auto- 
chthons,” said Mikko. “Pain is 
merely the entrance fee to a higher 
level of understanding. Let us pro- 
ceed.” 

On the block next to the square 
the houses were pressed close to- 
gether, separated only by narrow 
alleys. At that point they left the 
street and crept through a building 
to the back lot. Keeping well apart, 
they headed for the buildings front- 
ing the square. 

Mikko checked several back 
doorways until he found one with 
an open door. The rusty hinges of 



FIMBULSOMMER 



173 




the closed ones would have 
screamed their presence. He 
stepped inside the building and rap- 
idly checked to make sure it was 
completely deserted, then signaled 
Morgan. 

Morgan peered around the 
musty ground-floor room. “What 
a mess,” he whispered. “And it’s 
damn cold out of the sun. This 
planet might be warming up but 
I think there’s still a layer of per- 
mafrost.” 

“Before we go through to the 
front,” Mikko said, “notice any- 
thing peculiar?” 

Morgan looked more closely. 
“Someone seems to have ripped 
off most of the wallboard and even 
pieces of flooring.” 

“Right,” Mikko agreed. “And 
they’ve burned them in the fire- 
place.” 

“Natives trying to keep warm?” 
Morgan hypothesized. 

“Not likely. Remember, for 
them this is a hot spell. Besides, 
they seem to have removed the 
ash.” 

“What then? Obviously you’ve 
figured it out. Don’t hoard infQr- 
mation.” 

“Simple. They eat wood. That’s 
what the natives that clobbered us 
were probably doing — having 
lunch.” 

“Brill — you might say — iant. 
Lead on.” 

Mikko made his way to the 
front of the structure, Morgan 
carefully covering the rear. 



T HE windows facing the square 
had lost their glass so long ago 
that even the shards had been 
blown away or buried under the 
cake of dried mud covering the 
floor under the square frames. 
Mikko kneeled to the side of the 
hole, keeping carefully out of 
sight, while Morgan crawled under 
the opening and slowly lifted his 
head until his eyes peered out to 
survey the square. 

Trespassers W squatted, a silver 
egg shape, in the center of the field. 
She was surrounded by the legion 
of Quindar, who were keeping a 
respectful distance from her 
gleaming side. 

“Tress has spotted us,” Morgan 
whispered. 

“How can you tell?” 

“As soon as I stuck my head up 
she flashed a laser beam into my 
eyes. Two bright blinks.” 

“Good girl.” 

“I think I’m blind.” 

“Don’t be silly, Tress would 
never be that careless.” 

“Well, I can’t see anything. 
There — things are starting to come 
back into focus. Three aircars have 
landed to our right. A group of 
men surrounds them. The rest of 
the men are surrounding Tress. 
Must be thirty people out there.” 
“Weapons?” Mikko asked. 
“Indeed. Take a look. We’re in 
the shadow and no one is looking 
this way anyway.” 

Mikko stuck his head out. 
“Humph! Rapid-fire slug throw- 



174 



IF 




ers. Isn’t that some kind of pro- 
jectile weapon by the first aircar?” 

“I can’t tell from here.” 

“Notice,” Mikko said, point- 
ing with his chin. “Over, there to 
the left. Three men behind that 
wall. What do you think they’re 
doing?” 

“Sharpshooters,” Morgan 
guessed. “They’ve got scopes on 
those guns. Must be hoping for 
someone to stick his head out of 
the hatch.” 

“Agreed,” Mikko murmured. 
“They must have decided we’re 
hostile. I wonder how long it took 
them to reach that conclusion. I’ll 
wager that, with all the attention 
they’re paying to the ship, they 
wouldn’t notice it if two men were 
to sneak up behind and — ah — ac- 
cost them.” 

“Any particular two men you 
have in mind?” Morgan asked. He 
sighed. “I’ll get a rock.” 

“We’ll have to go around two 
buildings before coming out — to 
make sure we’re not seen by the 
rest of that bunch.” 

“Sneak it is, sir,” Morgan 
agreed. 

They crept back to the rear of 
the building and out to the alley. 
The back door to the building they 
wanted was rusted shut. 

“A window?” Morgan suggest- 
ed. He peered through the nearest 
glassless rectangle. “No, not this 
one. Our friendly natives have eat- 
en the floor.” 

“This side alley will do,” Mikko 



decided. He picked up a massive 
stone and hefted it in one large 
hand. Morgan settled for a smaller 
rock. 

They went silently down the al- 
ley to the front and paused, hidden 
by the corner of the building. 
About twenty meters in front of 
them, kneeling behind a large 
chunk of granite wall, the three 
sharpshooters were intent on their 
target. 

“Sneak?” Morgan asked. 

“Rush. Twenty meters. Less 
than three seconds. Ready?” 

“Ready.” 

They moved away from the 
building. Morgan noted that they 
were out of sight of anyone except 
their targets — and Tress. 

“Move!” 

The two naked men raced into 
the field, each with a stone gripped 
in his hand, like a pair of dinner- 
hunting Neanderthals. 

One of the sharpshooters must 
have seen a flicker of motion out 
of the corner of his eye. 

“Wha— ” 

A stone smashed against his 
head and he was silent. The second 
never turned. He slid down the rock 
to crumple on the purple-green 
moss. 

The third swiveled around, try- 
ing to bring his weapon to bear, 
mouth open to shout a warning. 
Mikko grabbed him around the 
throat and squeezed, cutting off 
air and blood. In three seconds the 
man went limp and Mikko low-

ered him gently to the ground. 

“Beautiful!” Morgan gasped. 
“But I think I’m a little out of 
shape. I need more exercise.” 

“I’ll remind you that you said 
that,” Mikko told him. “Put on 
those coveralls.” 

It was well that the stretch 
coveralls had plenty of give to 
them. Morgan found that the 
Quindar uniform was rather snug; 
Mikko found it almost impossible. 
He could feel the strain on the field 
of the magnetic seam in front. 

“Never steal from midgets,” 
Morgan whispered. “Can Tress 
hear us?” 

“I should say so,” Mikko said. 
“Tress? How say you?” 

Inside the ship itself, Tress re- 
ported to Metrak. One of her para- 
boloid directional sound pickups 
heard their voices easily. 

“Are you ready to let them in 
and repel boarders?” Metrak 
asked. 

“We are on riot alert,” Tress 
said calmly. “No weapons that 
can breach the hull are within de- 
tector distance. Should I increase 
to full battle alert?” 

“No,” said Metrak after a mo- 
ment. “Not while Morgan and 
Mikko are on the outside. Stay 
on riot control and let them know 
we are ready for them.” 
“Complying.” 

Outside, fifty meters away, 
Goodbit listened, his eyes slitted, 
as he heard the ship’s PA system 
say: 



Trespassers warned! This unit 
prepared for any and all attempts 
to board. 

Tress picked up Mikko’s whis- 
per. “Good girl, Tress. Now listen 
to what I have to say and relay to 
Metrak. Ready?” 

Trespassers warned! 

“Good. We’re going to get in 
as close as we can with these ill- 
fitting uniforms. Be ready to pick 
us up. If we’re spotted, Delta-gas 
the area and send Metrak down 
to retrieve our sleeping forms. No 
use taking chances.” 

Mikko turned to Morgan. 
“Ready?” he asked, picking up 
one of the rifles. 

Morgan grabbed another. “Let’s 
move out!” 

X 

G OODBIT sat on one of the 
steps of his aircar and glared 
at the ship. “Why did it say that?” 
“What’s that, Mister Goodbit?” 
Richtman asked. 

“That last bit of monologue 
from the ship. Why did it say 
that?” 

“I don’t know sir.” 

“There’s something wrong. Is 
that grenade launcher set?” 

“Yes, sir,” the group leader re- 
ported. “Set and on automatic.” 
Goodbit considered the problem. 
His men were all spread out around 
the field. Two of the sharpshooters 
had left the wall they were behind 
and were heading toward a frag- 



176 



IF 




ment of low wall closer to the ship. 

The situation was altogether too 
static. Something had to happen; 
the one thing positive about stale- 
mates was that they ended before 
expected. Goodbit’s rule was 
simple: if something is going to 
happen, cause it! Do onto others 
— first. He beckoned to Richtman. 
“Call the base. Tell them to send 
out a brace of thirty-centimeter 
rockets. Use the codebook in case 
that egg is monitoring.” 

Richtman entered the aircar to 
send the message. The two sharp- 
shooters passed the fragment of 
wall and closed in on the ship. 

Goodbit studied the scene, run- 
ning a small hand over his round, 
smooth-shaven chin. Something 
was wrong here. Very wrong. He 
felt that he had underestimated the 
situation, that an important fact 
was right before his eyes but some- 
how eluding him. 

The two sharpshooters moved 
forward and reached the inner 
circle of men surrounding the ship; 
something sparked in Goodbit’s 
calculating brain. 

“You two! Stop where you 
are!” he shouted through his bull- 
horn. “Enders! Disarm those two 
men standing to your left. If they 
attempt resistance, shoot them!” 
A sudden high, keening whistle 
permeated the air. 

The man Enders ignored the 
noise coming from the spaceship 
and turned. And went right on 
turning, his knees buckling beneath 



him. He fell in a twisted heap on 
the ground. Those around him be- 
gan to fall, including the two men 
he had been ordered to disarm. 

As Goodbit saw man after man 
fall in an ever- widening circle that 
spread away from the egg-shaped 
craft, a thought flashed through 
his mind: 

Delta-gas! Supersonic disper- 
sion! 

But it was too late for action. 
The gas had already reached him 
and Goodbit’s brain turned in on 
itself and ceased to function as a 
thinking entity. 



M ETRAK looked into the 
screen with what might have 
been a leer on his small, black 
face. “They would all seem to be 
out. What say you, Tress? Shall 
I go down and pick up Morgan and 
Mikko?” 

“All heartbeats and breathing 
rates are consistant with uncon- 
sciousness,” Tress decided. “The 
gas will have dispersed to the safe 
level in fifteen seconds.” 

“Perfect. It will take me that 
long to reach the lock.” Metrak 
trotted into the corridor and leaped 
the flight of stairs to the airlock 
landing. The double sphincter di- 
lated. 

Metrak leaped forward, his in- 
tention being to drop to the ground 
below, haul Mikko and Morgan 
up the ladder and tell Tress to take 
off instantly. He started his leap 



178 



IF 




just as something outside went 
WHACK! 

The automatic grenade-launch- 
er had fired as soon as the airlock 
sphincters had dilated. In mid-air, 
Metrak saw the grenade coming 
toward him. His ultra-fast reflexes, 
evolved in an environment that 
needed them, took over. He twist- 
ed in mid-air and grabbed at the 
missile as it snapped past him. 

But not even muscle and nerves 
trained at half a kilogee can be to- 
tally accurate. The grenade, bullet- 
fast, touched the tips of Metrak’s 
fingers, snapped upward, bounced 
off the hard alloy ceiling, and 
dropped down the stairwell. 

The explosion, a millisecond 
later, merely added to Metrak’s 
velocity as he shot on out of the 
airlock. 



IKKO! Be pleased to wake 
up, Mikko! hfikko!’' 
Something like a pair of pliers 
was pinching Mikko’s arm, shak- 
ing him at the same time — and 
none too gently. 

He forced his eyes open and saw 
double. “I am awake, Professor,” 
he said rather hoarsely. “Control 
that little hand of yours, my good 
friend, or you’ll leave bruises clear 
down to the bone.” 

“Oh! I am sorry.” The pinch 
went away and Mikko tried to con- 
solidate his double-image of the 
overhead into a single image. He 
didn’t quite succeed. 



He closed his eyes again and 
said, “Where are we?” 

“Nearly a parsec away from our 
takeoff,” Metrak said. “Acceler- 
ating on flicker drive. How do you 
feel?” 

Mikko kept his eyes closed. “In 
the past twenty hours, I have been 
given a minor concussion and a 
dose of Delta-gas. My head hurts, 
and my body is still numb. I know 
that I shall be unable to move 
around for at least half an hour. 
How do I feel? Just great. How is 
Morgan?” 

“Still unconscious. In spite of 
your greater age, you seem to re- 
cover from these things more 
rapidly. I gave him the antidote 
first, but he is still asleep.” 

“Any indications that we have 
been followed?” Mikko asked. 

“None. Unless an antidote is 
brought from their main station, 
the Quindar troops will be uncon- 
scious for another hour. But — ” 

“Will we need to go back?” 
Mikko interrupted. “For evidence, 
I mean.” 

“I think not,” Metrak said soft- 
ly. “I hope not. But — before I say, 
what have you and Morgan found 
out?” 

Mikko opened his eyes, found 
they still wouldn’t track, closed 
them again. Then, groggily, he told 
Metrak what had happened in the 
contemplation cell — including what 
they had learned from the prisoner. 

“It conjugates with the facts I 
have already reported by inverse

space tube,” Metrak said. “It is 
—how did you call it? — a shoe- 
string operation. I saw — 

Mikko, his mind still rather fuz- 
zy, interrupted again. “We didn’t 
get any recordings. No real evi- 
dence. What did you get?” 

“Good recordings, Mikko. Al- 
ready sent. We have proved pol- 
lution and slavery. And attempted 
genocide.” 

Mikko’s arms and legs tingled 
horribly as they came slowly out 
of their paralysis. He kept himself 
immobile and said, “Forced labor 
at what, to the natives, is a high 
temperature. Killing them off.” 
“Not exactly,” Metrak said. 
“Though they think they are.” 
Mikko turned his head to look 
at Metrak and wished he hadn’t. 
He clamped his eyes shut again. 
“What do you mean?” he asked 
weakly. 

“The local people suffer of the 
heat, that is so,” Metrak said, 
“and they appear to die. They are 
taken away to a — a disposal place. 
Some of them die. Most do not. 
Those who do not are removed by 
their kinsmen to a cave — a series 
of caves — in the mountains. They 
are taken down deep, where the 
temperature is constant, and they 
are tenderly placed with others on 
soft moss. They sleep. They — how 
do you say?” 

Mikko sighed and relaxed, “Es- 
tivate, my dear Professor, estivate. 
They sleep through the hot sum-, 
mer that comes but once in a hun- 



dred millennia — or whatever it is. 
Lloyds will be glad to hear that; 
it takes them off the hook.” 

“How so?” Metrak asked, blink- 
ing anthracite eyes. 

“The autochthons would have 
to be rescued if this near pass of 
the A-5 would kill them. But it 
won’t. They’re used to it — it’s part 
of their racial cycle. Probably a 
very old race, you see. Slow mu- 
tation rate. Does the A-5 passing 
encourage mutation or does es- 
tivation keep them back? Does — ” 
Mikko brought himself up short, 
clamping his lips. “Excuse me, 
Professor; I’m babbling nonsense. 
Can you — ” 

“t/AAA ...” The sound came 
from Morgan’s compleat. 

“Our friend seems to be coming 
around, Professor. How do you 
feel, Morgan?” 

“Mizzabul,” Morgan said 
thickly. “Where are we?” 

“Well away from the scene, I 
assure you.” Mikko paused. 
“Where are we headed, by the way, 
Professor?” 

“Toward Proxit. I assume.” 
“What do you mean; you as- 
sume? Tress, where are we head- 
ed?” Mikko opened his eyes. There 
was no answer. He jumped to his 
feet and fought down a wave of 
dizziness. He realized that Tress 
had said no word since he had 
awakened. And Tress should have 
answered his question about posi- 
tion in the first place. 

Metrak folded his two foremost 



180 



IF 




limbs over his belly and looked up 
into Mikko’s eyes. “The lady is 
dead.” 

Mikko turned and stared at the 
control and instrument console. 
The battle control computer, 
normally just another I/O device 
for Tress, had taken over. It was 
fleeing the scene of battle, as or- 
dered. 

Morgan lifted his head weakly. 
“Tress dead? What do you mean?” 

“It is all my fault,” said Me- 
trak. “I take full blame. The hos- 
tiles had a missile-thrower aimed 
at the hatch. It went off automatic- 
ally when the hatch dilated, even 
though the man operating it was 
unconscious. I attempted to de- 
flect the missile as it passed me 
and only succeeded in knocking it 
downward. It detonated against 
the globe of Tress’s consciousness. 
What you call the main processing 
unit. It was penetrated and de- 
stroyed. Tress is no longer opera- 
tional.” 

Morgan, still weak and dizzy, 
tried to rise from his compleat, 
but Mikko shoved him back down 
with a palm. 

“Stay here. I’ll look.” he 
pounded down the spiral to the 
deck below. 

“Well?” Morgan asked after 
a minute. 

“She’s a mess, all right,” came 
Mikko’s voice. “Metrak was right. 
The MPU is junk. So is all her on- 
line memory. That bomb quite 
literally blew her brains out.” 



Morgan sat upright again. Most 
of the dizziness had worn off by 
now. “How about the records?” 

“I’m checking,” Mikko said. 

Morgan looked carefully at his 
control panel, then tapped several 
keys in sequence. A screen lit up, 
displaying tightly packed orange 
symbols against a blue back- 
ground. 

“You hit the ACTIVATE key, 
Metrak?” he asked. 

“Yes,” the little being said. “It 
was blinking green and you have 
told me what to do. Did I do 
wrong?” 

“No. You did just exactly right. 
The battle computer was pro- 
gramed to take off and head for 
Proxit as soon as you hit that key. 
Very good.” 

“Is there, then, another brain 
aboard?” 

“In a way. It’s nothing like as 
complicated and complex as Tress 
and normally Tress uses it as an 
input-output deyice. But it can — 
and does — control the ship under 
combat conditions. It’s rather 
small and it’s hidden under heavy 
armor. Only a Navy ship would 
normally have such a thing — and 
the Trespassers W used to be just 
that.” 

“But how would it know what 
to do?” Metrak asked, puzzled. 

“It wouldn’t unless Tress told 
it.” He waved at the bright orange- 
and-blue display. “She saw that 
grenade coming in and had nearly 
three-quarters of a second to react. 



FIMBULSOMAAER 



181 




Just before the explosion, she fed 
all the takeoff data to battle con- 
trol and programed it to act as 
soon as the ACTIVATE key was 
pressed.” 

“Her dying act,” Metrak said 
softly. “She set things up so that 
we might live.” 

“You might put it that way.” 
Mikko came up the spiral. 
“Records all okay. All off-line 
datasets okay except one, which 
seems to have a slight hairline 



crack in the crystal. We won’t 
know whether we’ve lost any im- 
portant bits until we feed it into 
another computer on Proxit.” 

“Yes,” said Metrak, squeezing 
his small hands together, “we must 
get another computer, of course. 
But there will never be another like 
Tress. She was a good friend and 
1 loved her.” 

Mikko and Morgan looked at 
him strangely — but neither said 
a word. • 



OF RELAYS AND ROSES 

at least he had convinced them. 

The Senator on the left said, 
“You give the service to — ” 

“People in private industry, 
government, or nonprofit institu- 
tions who in our judgment may 
eventually be in a position to give 
us business. Others are charged a 
minimal fee. I’m happy to say 
we’ve gotten that down quite a 
bit.” 

The Senator in the center 
smiled suddenly. It was the charm- 
ing, slightly lopsided smile he had 
used on a thousand campaign 
posters. 

“If I’m not being impertinent, 
Mr. Smithe,” he asked, “could 
you tell us your own marital sta- 
tus?” 

“I have been a widower for al- 
most twenty years.” 

“You haven’t used the Roses 
service yourself?” 



( Continued from page 169) 

In a voice that was barely audi- 
ble he said, “To tell the truth, 
Senator, I’ve had to postpone my 
trip to England because of these 
hearings. You see, our president 
wanted to make certain I’d be here 
to testify. Marcia — that’s her 
name; she’s a librarian in Liver- 
pool — Marcia and I have written 
and talked by long-distance tele- 
phone but we’ve not yet been able 
to meet.” 

“I hope you will be able to 
soon,” the Senator in the center 

said. “You may step down, Mr. 
Smithe.” 

He began the long walk back to 
his seat, glad he hadn’t been forced 
to tell them that it was Marcia 
who had requested Roses from 
the company’s British subsidiary. 
That she had found him. It would 
have sounded too silly. •

spotted it first thing.” 

“Well, I thought I could change 
my story a little,” Dowles #1 
said somewhat hesitantly, “make 
myself out to be a cousin of 
Dowles or something.” 

“Hopeless,” Dowles #2 said. 
“We saw what you were doing and 
timed our entry when we thought 
you’d be leaving. It was you who 
gave it away.” 

Whyteborn was still standing 
transfixed, staring at the spot 
where his hand went through 
Dowles #2. “I don’t think your 
treatment is very much better,” he 
said calmly to the image in front 
of him. “Your right arm is shorter 
than the left. Not to mention this.” 
He gestured with the hand that was 
submerged in the other’s stomach. 

#2 looked ruefully down at the 
hand. “That is unavoidable, I’m 
afraid. This is — ”

“As I was saying, this is merely

Soviet Union in 1987 will be dis- 
astrous, leading to — ” 

“Wait.” A third voice broke in, 
lower than the first two. Another 
Dowles was forming and rippling 
slightly on the other side of the 
table. “Don’t listen to them. The 
British government — ” 

“It’s time you knew the truth,” 
a fourth voice said. A stocky, 
slightly blue Dowles had appeared 
by the oscilloscope and was bear- 
ing down on Whyteborn. “These 
others are liars — ” 

“Stop a moment,” Whyteborn 
said, irritated. “You are all liars, 
if you’ll only stop and think. If 
you are from the future you must 
realize there are alternate futures 
and each of you is from a different 
one.” 

“Yes,” said several of them. 
Two more Dowles appeared and 
were hushed by the others. Whyte- 
born ignored them and went on. 

“When I began to realize there 
were too many of those telegraph 
messages for me to know which 
to believe, you stepped in with 
these television pictures or what-

ever it is that you call them.” 
“We had to,” Dowles #1 
squeaked. “If you keep on with 
your research you will destroy our 
past, the past in which tachyons 
were not discovered. My present 
will disappear — and I with it.” 

T HE rest began to shout pro- 
tests and Whyteborn waved 
his hands for them to stop. More 
Dowleses were flickering into be- 
ing around the laboratory. The 
room was becoming crowded. 

“Quiet!” Whyteborn shouted. 
This served to calm the laboratory 
slightly. “You must under- 
stand — ” 

“You don’t see what tachyons 
will lead to, Whyteborn!” yelled a 
new apparition. This most recent 
edition of Dowles opened his 
mouth to continue and then saw 
the other images standing about 
the laboratory. He turned, looking 
at all of them, and suddenly looked 
very surprised. He vanished with- 
out ever closing his mouth. 

“There went one of you who re- 
alized the implications of what’s 
happening,” Whyteborn said sar- 
castically. 

A deformed Dowles with three 
feet and webbed hands appeared at 
Whyteborn’s elbow. “Thruk! As- 
ram pluddex!” it said. 

“Have you all forgotten that 
messages sent into the past can 
cause paradoxes? Contradictions 
of cause and effect?” Whyteborn 
asked. 



Dowles #2 shrugged. The others 
simply stared. 

“Practically speaking — if you 
people had taken the time to think 
about it — a message contains in- 
formation only if the receiver can 
believe it.” 

“Believe me! I tell the truth!” 
three Dowleses said together. They 
stopped and looked at each other. 

“Listen, you dunce,” one of the 
nearer Dowleses said, “I don’t 
have the power reserves to send 
this picture back to you much 
longer and I don’t have time to 
listen to another of your lectures. 
Do as I say and — ” 

“As you say?” Whyteborn said. 
“I’ve already had years of your 
shallow thinking. I put up with it 
because of Helen. Just — ” 
“Shallow! You—” 

“Look at this, it’s a mob,” 
Whyteborn said, shouting louder. 
“How could I trust you? I don’t 
know which of you will be my fu- 
ture — you’re all equally possible. 
I don’t know your motives — ” 
“Chauvinist!” cried one of the 

Dowleses. “Enemy of the work- 



ers — 

“There’s no use trying to con- 
fuse me with these false Dowleses, 
either,” Whyteborn said hotly. “I 
can’t be tricked into stopping or 
continuing my experiments.” 

“He’ll kill us all!” screamed 
Dowles #1. 

“Murderer!” another cried. 
“Helen will—” 

“Quat thrunk!”

IF 




The shimmering images moved 
toward Whyteborn angrily, ges- 
turing. Even though he knew they 
were only projections, Whyteborn 
stepped back. 

The nearest figure raised his 
fist as if to strike. Whyteborn in- 
stinctively threw up an arm to 
ward off the blow and ducked to 
the side. 

He slipped. 

His head struck the edge of the 
table. There was a solid snapping 
noise. His body went completely 
limp before it hit the floor. 

The images leaped back, star- 
tled. 

“But this didn't happen in my 
— " said one, and vanished. 

“Whyteborn cant die—" 

The remaining images looked 
at each other in surprise. More 
winked out of existence. Dowles 
#2 started to say something, then 
shrugged and disappeared. Within 
a moment they were all gone. 

A short time later the original 
and now only Dowles returned to 
the laboratory with the two gradu- 
ate students he had gone to find. 



He discovered Whyteborn’s body. 
The university physician, who was 
called immediately, stated that 
Whyteborn had died instantly of a 
broken neck and severe damage to 
the spinal cord. No one could be 
quite sure just how it had hap- 
pened. 

The funeral was held two days 
later. Whytebom's daughter, Hel- 
en, was considerably distraught. 
William Dowles was gentle and 
considerate; he handled most of 
the details and was of great com- 
fort to her. 

The paper presenting their dis- 
covery of tachyons was soon ready 
for publication. The death of 
Whyteborn had left a vacancy in 
the staff. Dowles soon moved up 
and acquired a more solid position 
in the physics department of Skag 
College. Some time later he be- 
came more involved with teaching 
and ceased to do active research. 
Some slight trace of caution re- 
strained him, however, and the pa- 
per he had written with James 
Whyteborn was never published. • 



THE SEVENTH MAN 

Inch by precious inch the scoot- 
er was moving toward the ship. 
There was the sound of a faint 
click and he knew he had made 
contact — the instruments indicated 
a successful docking. He activa- 
ted the lock control and waited an 
eternity of ten slow, sticky seconds 



( Continued from page 145) 

for the air pressure to equalize. 
Then the bay doors opened and the 
scooter slowly slipped into the 
dark, inviting interior of the ship. 
The bay doors closed behind him. 

Eric opened the canopy and 
dragged Philmore out into the air 
chamber, taking care to avoid the 



185 




clumps of jelly that the vehicle had 
carried into the ship with them. 
The substance was bubbling with a 
soft, popping sound as it began to 
eat away the soft, metal alloy of 
the chamber’s interior 

Eric placed Philmore in one 
corner of the chamber and dashed 
out of the airlock, down the long 
corridor leading to the main stor- 
age area. 

A plan caught up with his in- 
stincts at the moment he stepped 
into the storage room. He tore in- 
to the stacks of boxed tools and 
supplies. Finally he found what he 
was looking for: a large box on 
which the word EXPLOSIVES 
had been carefully stenciled. 

He removed the crate from its 
fastenings and pushed it ahead of 
him back down the corridor, rac- 
ing as fast as he could in the zero- 
G environment, scuffling his feet 
along the rough gravity pads on 
the floor. His lungs were throb- 
bing painfully and he felt a scald- 
ing sensation in his arms and legs. 

Philmore had said the thing out- 
side was a cell, Eric thought. The 
ship was an irritant and all of the 
organism’s destructive power was 
focused on her. He had to some- 
how divert its energies away from 
the ship long enought to break free. 

The jelly in the airlock had 
changed to the color of stagnant 
mud and was no longer active. 
Eric guessed that the material had 
died upon exposure to oxygen. 
Outside, seen through a tiny ob- 



servation portal, the ooze had 
transformed itself to a deep, red 
color, laced with streaks of green 
and purple. Eric knew he did not 
have much time. 

Quickly, he opened the canopy 
of the scooter and placed the ex- 
plosives in its interior, set the ig- 
nition timer on the crate for nine- 
ty seconds, then activated the en- 
gines of the scooter, setting them 
at full thrust. Finally he pressed 
the launch lever and closed the 
canopy. 

Eric managed to drag Philmore 
out through the lock. The door 
closed, just as the portals opened 
and the scooter surged forward 
and disappeared into the surround- 
ing jelly. 

Eric turned to Find Philmore 
standing beside him. 

“I’m sorry,” Philmore said 
quietly, “I—” 

“I know,” Eric said quickly. 
“Follow me. We have to hurry.” 

Seventy-Five seconds. 

Philmore shuffled down the 
corridor behind Eric, straining to 
hear the explanation shouted over 
the other man’s shoulder. Then 
they were in the central chamber 
and Eric was at the main control 
panel. 

Eric glanced at his watch. They 
had forty seconds. 

The computers set for the return 
voyage, both men raced to a cubi- 
cle and strapped themselves into 
the life-support couches. Eric in- 
serted the hypodermic needle into 



186 



IF 




his flesh and waited for the numb- 
ing sensation to creep through his 
body. 

Fifteen seconds. 

Eric knew he had to time the in- 
jection just right; the blast mech- 
anism on the ship was set for man- 
ual control. If he was not awake 
to press the manual launch but- 
ton, they would disintegrate in the 
atmosphere. His vision was going 
out of focus now and he had to 
feel for the button with his fingers. 

Then he felt the shock wave 
from the scooter as it exploded 
somewhere outside the ship. Eric 
pressed the launch button, and he 
could feel the engines inside the 
ship throb to life. The shock waves 
from the explosion crashed against 



LIFECYCLE 

waxy, almost molten. 

I’ve got to get back . 

He sprang down to the body of 
the dog. But a frantic fumbling 
with his living “vehicle” proved 
futile. Apparently a dead creature 
could not be taken over. Or his 
heat-seared limbs were beyond 
proper function. 

He was just desperately giving 
the creature its own control once 
more, hoping its instincts would 
save the two of them, when he 
heard a voice. The alien’s mind re- 
ceived the sounds as gibberish but 
his own mind caught the fleeting 
memory of the sounds and was 
able to translate them as the voice 
of one of the crewmen, saying, 



the side of the ship, and the metal 
shuddered. Outside the portals the 
atmosphere changed suddenly to 
a brilliant, scintillating green that 
gradually shifted to a dull, yellow- 
ish brown. 

Eric’s last sensation was that of 
motion. The force of the scooter’s 
explosion had momentarily freed 
them from the grip of the atmo- 
sphere. The thrust of the engines 
was carrying them home, to the 
Earth. 

A series of images engulfed 
Claude Philmore as he too slipped 
into his drug-induced coma. Green 
trees, bathed in warm sunlight, 
waved flowing branches. 

A mountain of clouds drifted by 
in the distance. • 



(Continued from page 160) 
“There it is — the hound is right 
over here, on the shore—” 

Norcriss felt the alien tense its 
limbs and knew what the fate of 
that approaching crew member 
would be in another instant. 

Grabbing control once more, he 
forced himself to scuttle on blis- 
tered limbs down the slope and in- 
to the waters of the swamp. He 
swam rapidly away. The animal 
seemed to have no gills, so he had 
to keep its head above the surface, 
where the reflected sunlight was 
striking the fragile skull of the 
beast. There was a shadowy area 
ahead, a dark cave between over- 
hanging, twisted marsh grasses. 
He managed to get into it, then 



187 





could only cling weakly to the 
ragged stem at the deepest part of 
the gap, hoping he hadn’t pushed 
his host beyond its physical en- 
durance. He was weak, sick and 
probably dying. He could only 
cling and hope that Contact would 
end before the creature did. It 
seemed hours before that welcome 
flash of silent lightning released 
his mind from the dessicated body 
of the snake-thing, but eventually 
it came — 

— and he was safely back upon 
the couch. 

tfVT^ELL, sir?” asked Ryder 
▼ ▼ curiously as Norcriss rose 
from the couch, wearily removing 
the helmet from his skull. 

“The ecologists were right, but 
for the wrong reasons, Ensign. The 
two species they worried about are 
harmless. The third is a deadly 
version of a marine creature of 
Earth. A soft-bodied animal that 
relies for protection on the cast- 
off shells of mollusks or even crus- 
taceans on the ocean bottom. But 
in one respect, it’s mortally differ- 
ent: it uses living shells to inhab- 
it.” 

By the time he had finished tell- 
ing Ryder about the snake-crea- 
ture, the crewmen had gathered up 
the paraphernalia of the zoologist, 
stored it back aboard the ship and 
one of them took upon himself the 
task of burying the dead hound. 
When the ship blasted off from 
Rigel II, Norcriss wrote up his re- 



port to his superiors back on Earth 
with an odd feeling of elation. For 
the first time in his career as a 
Learner he found his sympathies 
lying with the would-be colonists, 
instead of the animals those colon- 
ists must destroy to establish them- 
selves upon a new planet. 

His recommendation of Rigel II 
was conditional to someone’s de- 
veloping a competent anti-swamp- 
snake mask for the colonists to 
wear. Eventually, a poison, a wea- 
pon, or a predator would be devel- 
oped that would wipe every trace 
of the animal from the face of the 
planet. Loss of the snakes might 
result, in turn, in loss of the proper 
stimulus for the pie-things to tear 
loose, which would mean no slug- 
things for the avians to dine upon, 
which might mean the end of the 
avians, too. 

But Norcriss could not bring 
himself to regret a single extinc- 
tion. There was something un- 
wholesome about swampland, 
something that made the natural 
fauna just as unwholesome to the 
zoologist. He found he was glad to 
be instrumental in even a minor 
destruction of the creatures in 
such a place. 

He was still shivery after his pe- 
riod of death and darkness in that 
initial Contact. 

An eye for an eye, he told him- 
self, is hardly a scientific attitude, 
Norcriss. 

But he signed the recommenda- 
tion with a flourish. •

propriate that I step down, leav- 
ing the field clear for a new elec- 
tion. Accordingly, gentlemen, I 
hereby resign the office of Presi- 
dent in favor of my vice president, 
Hoobrik.” 

Amid the clamor that broke 
out, Clawhammer made his way to 
confront Retief. 

“You blundered at last, sir,” he 
murmured in a voice aquiver with 
rage. “You should have clung to 
your spurious position long 
enough to have gotten a head start 
for the Galactic periphery! I’ll see 
you thrown into a dungeon so deep 
that your food will have to be low- 
ered to you in pressurized con- 
tainers! I’ll—” 

“You’ll be on hand to dedicate 
the statue to our first Ex-Presi- 
dent, I ween?” President Hoobrik 
addressed the Terran envoy. “1 
think a hundred-foot monument 
will be appropriate to express the 
esteem in which we hold our Tsugg 
emeritus, Dir Tief, eh?” 

“Why, ah—” 

“We’ll appreciate your accredit- 
ing him as permanent Political Ad- 
visor to Oberon,” Hoobrik con- 
tinued. “We’ll need him handy to 
pose.” 



(Continued from page 95) 

“To be sure,” Clawhammer 
gulped. 

“Now I think it’s time we be- 
took ourselves off to more private 
surroundings. Dir Tief,” the Pres- 
ident said. “We need to plot party 
strategy for the by-election.” 

“You’re all invited to sample 
the hospitality of the Plump Sau- 
sage'' Binkster Druzz spoke up. 
“Provided I have your promises 
there’ll be no breeching of walls.” 

“Done!” Hoobrik cried heart- 
ily. “And by the way, Dir Druzz — 
What wouldst think of the idea of 
a coalition, eh?” 

“Hmm — Twilprit sagacity 

linked with Tsugg bulk might in- 
deed present a formidable ticket,” 
Binkster concurred. 

“Well, Retief,” Magnan said as 
the party streamed toward the 
gate, “yours was surely the short- 
est administration in the annals of 
representational government. Tell 
me confidentially — how in the 
world did you induce that band of 
thugs to accept you as their nom- 
inee?” 

“I’m afraid that will have to re- 
main a secret for now,” Retief 
said. “But just wait until I write 
my memoirs.” •

ample. It’s marvelous prose. It's full 
of meaningful images, strung on a fas- 
cinating plot. It has its measure of 
poetry, and its underlying realities are 
quite patent, but never dull. Above all, 
it’s definitely SF. 

Somehow, I feel there must be two 
Jakobssons: the one who grabbed 
( eagerly , I hope) Sturgeon’s " Sculp- 
ture ” and the other one who passed 
( reluctantly , I hope ) Plachta’s “ Festi-

As far as Bodes strip is concerned, 
well. it’s not a matter of how much 
sex there's in it, or how much violence. 
It’s a matter of ” redeeming literary 
value,” to paraphrase you know who. 
After scanning Bodes Bump ( pun in- 
tended) my Redeem-o-meter registers 
a cold Zero. Yes, he can draw. The 
question is, what is he going to do with 
his talent? 

No one belongs under a camel’s 
foot, least of all our Editor. And, while 
I have never tried it, I imagine it must 
be quite a task attempting to balance 
a magazine’s contents so that it satis-

ers. I just don't happen to think that 
either Plachta or Bode are essential to 
that task.

Dear Mr. Jakobs son; 

Like a knife in the chest; the pain 
unbearable. What has been done to our 
magazine? What has happened to our 
WORLDS OF IF? 

No, not BIMONTHLY! Not after 
all the years of success and three grand 
Hugos. Why? How could the world's 
best science-fiction magazine be low- 

190 



ered to such a position? Is there no re- 
consideration, no control, no possibil- 
ity of bringing our magazine back 
twelve times a year? 

Is this the price we readers pay to 
see the likes of the new WORLDS OF 
TOMORROW? Is it worth losing six 
issues of the great IF a year? I won- 
der. 

Sincerely, 
Thomas R. Harper 
Murfreesboro, Tennessee 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson, 

I just received my May- June IF in 
the mail and I noticed that you have 
gone bi-monthly. Why? The only an- 
swer that I can supply to this question 
is that the resurrection of WORLDS 
OF FANTASY and WORLDS OF 
TOMORROW has cost so much mon- 
ey that IF will have to go bi-monthly 
(I certainly hope GALAXY can stay 
monthly). If this is true then you 
should have at least told the readers of 
your magazine about it, or better yet, 
have asked us whether or not we would 
rather have two monthly magazines 
or 3(?) bi-monthly ones. I would have 
said two bi-monthly mags. Again, you 
should have told the readers about the 
change in format. Or do the readers 
matter so little to you? GALAXY and 
IF are now the best SF magazines pub- 
lished why not stay with a winner? I 
will not threaten to discontinue sub- 
scribing to and reading your maga- 
zines because I like reading Science 
Fiction too much for that. Also the 
loss of money would not help you go 
monthly. 

Secondly, I ask you please tell us 
something about this change in format. 
How long will IF be bi-monthly? Will 

IF 




GALAXY continue to be published 
monthly? Will a bi-monthly IF be larg- 
er? There are many question which I 
hope that you will answer in the next 
issue. 

Sincerely, 
Bill A ndresen

WOF and WOT had nothing to do 
with IF s going bimonthly. We're in- 
creasing the size of all four publica- 
tions and experimenting on methods 
of putting together the best possible 
magazines — this has to do with availa- 
bility of top material, editorially. Both 
If and Galaxy are on the upswing in 
sales since the change of ownership a 
little more than a year ago and may 
soon again go monthly. 

Dear Mr. Jakobosson: 

The “ new Silverberg” continues to 
amaze me. “The Reality Trip “ is a 
long inward look into the characters 
and the times. 

Good to see Avram Davidson back 
in the sf magazines with “ Zon “ (and 
“ Timeserver “ in May GALAXY). 
“Zon” has a strength and beauty un- 
matched in all the other stories in the 
May-June IF. 

I enjoy Jack Gaughans work in 
both your publications, but I feel it's 
high time you let other good excep- 
tinal artists in. 

Peace, 
Bill Wolfenbarger 
Neosho, Missouri 

Dear Mr. Jakobs son: 

“Zon“ impressed me as being the 
first five chapters of a tight, well-struc- 
tured novel. I must confess ignorance 
as to Mr. Davidson s previous accom- 
plishments, but I do recognize the 

HUEANDCRY 



blend of skill and imagination required 
of a good science-fiction writer. It is 
unfortunate that “Zon“ is destined to 
remain unfinished, the potential is 
there. 

I am glad you chose to publish these 
few chapters, for they stand well alone 
on their own merit. 

Grant Moyer 
Burlington, Vermont 

We were particularly pleased to have 
Avram Davidson in GALAXY and IF 
after a too-many-year absence. “Zon," 
as you have guessed is part of a larger 
work in progress. We hope to be able 
to bring you the rest of it. 

Dear Sir: 

As this is the first time l have writ- 
ten to you, I would like to say that 
IF is the best magazine going, and it 
should have won the Hugo award 
hands down. One complaint, though 
( just a small one), I would like to see 
more stories by the worlds best sf writ- 
er Arthur C. Clarke, as you have not 
had one of his stories for ages. “By 
the Falls," by Harry Harrison was one 
of the best stories I have read. 

Yours faithfully, 
Malcolm Wall 
Lancaster, England 

We, too, would like to see more 
stories from Arthur C. Clarke (you 
did catch his “Neutron Tide," in the 
May GALAXY, didn't you?) and we 
keep hounding him to write. Trouble 
is for the last five years he has been 
busy with 2001 , first writing it and 
more recently promoting the film 
around the world. Last time we saw 
Arthur, he was talking about getting 
back to his first love — sf. So, let’s 
hope ....

Dear Mr. Jakobs son: 

The best single thing you’ve done 
since becoming editor was establishing 
Jack Gaughan as an assistant direc- 
tor. Galaxy and If have never looked 
better, and the illustrations are Gau- 
ghan at his best. Many would disagree, 
but I think that you should use his il- 
lustrations almost exclusively, as you 
have been doing. Besides providing the 
best of art, it gives the magazines a 
distinctive style. Will that be your pol- 
icy from now on? 

Best of luck.

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I have to write to protest the lack 
of quality in some of the stories in 
your magazine. The worst issue the 
January, 1970, issue with two sicken- 
ingly soupy stories on the same sub- 
ject: "If a Man Answers," by Richard 
Wilson and "This One," by James Sal- 
lis. No wonder your rating fell; I won- 
der how you got the prize twice in a 
row anyway. Only Frank Herbert’s 
"great" ( as you say) serial and "O 
Kind Master ’’ ( even with it’s unlikely 
ending ) partly saved the day. 

Hopefully yours, 
Edwin Todd 
Richmond, Virginia 

For the record, //received the Hugo 
three years in succession. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

IF #148 was not one of your better 
issues: "Reality Trip" — one of the 
good stories — was an interesting 
weirdy; " Piecemakers" — I like Laum- 
er, but Vm sick of Retief; "Zon ” — 
okay till the end, which was quite poor 



unless this is the first of a series; "Mis- 
spelled Magician" — very funny and 
very good so far; "Troubleshooter" 
— interesting idea, poor story; " Hu- 
man Element" — pure cliche; "Night- 
blooming Saurian’’— ditto cliche. The 
cover was one of the few bits of Gau- 
ghan artwork I liked. I prefer the styles 
of Barr and Fabian. 

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Mr. Hval's letter (May-June, 1970) 
caught my interest for two reasons: 
Canadian readers of SF have up until 
now been as scarce as moon rocks, 
and his request opens the possibility 
of experimentation. 

In answer (?) to his questions I sug- 
gest the following ideas. First, large 
meetings can be unwieldy and can get 
hung up in organizational problems. 
Thus I suggest setting up small discus- 
sion groups .which have a less formal 
atmosphere and lend to freer discus- 
sion. The goal of such groups would 
be to produce a " think-tank ” mood 
where the ideas presented in SF could 
be discussed, on the basis of feasibility 
and desirability. While these ideas are 
being discussed the question could be 
posed as to whether or not anything 
can be done to encourage or prevent 
such events happening. 

If the mem bers of a group or groups 
decide they can do something on their 
own or with the entire organization the 
transition from "think-tank" to " DO- 
tank" could offer not only an excuse 
for such an organization, but a valid 
reason by getting people involved in 
making Science Fiction an actual Fact.

Brian Carroll

How the Clisb works: Each month it offers a 
really superb new science fact or fiction book at 
a fraction of its regular price. Even though these 
books sell for $4.95, $5.95 and more in their orig- 
inal editions. Club members get them for only 
$1.49 each-in special full-length, hard-cover edi- 
tions-unless you select an extra-value book at 
slightly higher price. And the Club tells you in 
advance what each monthly selection will be. 
During your trial membership, you agree to take 
as few as four books in the coming year. Cancel 
any time thereafter. 

No-Risk Guarantee: If not delighted with intro- 
ductory 3-book shipment, return books within 10 
days to cancel membership. Otherwise you will 
be enrolled in the Club as a Trial Member. Mail
