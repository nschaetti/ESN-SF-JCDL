EING STARS 



sphere are lights in the sky at 
night — and not all of them 
are stars. Every once in a while 
something else wheels into view 
— a nova, a long-period comet, 
a hatch of meteorites — to bright- 
en up our night-time sky and 
give us something changeable 
and fresh to look at. This Sep- 
tember particularly there are a 
couple of objects on display 
which you don’t usually find, no 
matter how hard you look. 

For instance, did you ever see 
an asteroid with the naked eye? 

With a little luck, you just 
might be able to see one around 
September 2d. It is the worldlet 
Vesta, a 240-mile-diameter boul- 
der, third largest of the thou- 
sands of chunks of rock we call 
the asteroid belt. (About 50,000, 

4 



to be more precise — 1600 known 
and catalogued, and a lot that 
aren’t.) You may never have 
thought of an asteroid as a 
naked-eye object, and indeed the 
other 49,999 aren’t. But Vesta is 
not only big, it is for some un- 
known reason particularly bright. 
Every once in a while it makes a 
specially close approach to the 
Earth, and then it comes right up 
to the threshhold of vision. 

If you’d like to test your 
sharpness of eye on Vesta, here’s 
how: First, make sure it’s a clear 
night. (At its brightest Vesta 
reaches just a hair above 6th 
magnitude, which is usually con- 
sidered the lower limit for bare- 
eye viewing.) Second, locate the 
constellation Aquarius.

Aquarius is first to find the North 
Star. Then draw from it an im- 
aginary line, slightly curved, 
sweeping south and a touch west- 
ward through Cassiopeia and the 
Great Square in Pegasus until 
you come to Aquarius. 

That’s the usual way. Fortun- 
ately, this year it is a little easier. 
The planet Saturn happens to 
be stagnating in Aquarius right 
now, exhibiting that retrograde 
motion that so puzzled the epicy- 
clists : so if you look toward the 
south in the late evening the 
brightest object you see is prob- 
ably Saturn, and the stars around 
it are the constellation you want, 
Aquarius. Well, a few degrees 
southeast of Saturn you should, 
the fates being with you, find a 
very faint object; and if you 
watch it for a couple of evenings, 
and it* moves, or changes its ap- 
pearance, or disappears entirely, 
you will then know you have had 
a naked-eye sighting of the aster- 
oid Vesta. 

yt lmost equally difficult to see 
-**■ — but not because it isn’t 
bright — is the planet Mercury. 

Considering that it is a first- 
magnitude object, it is surprising 
that so few people have seen it 
with the naked eye — or, at least, 
recognized what they have seen. 
The trouble, of course, is that the 
little devil lies so close to the 
sun that most of the time when 

6 



Mercury is in the sky, it is un- 
fortunately a daylight sky. A 
couple of times a year, for a day 
or two at a time, we have a fight- 
ing chance to find it. This year’s 
best remaining chance occurs in 
the early mornings around Sep- 
tember 19th. 

Your first step is to get out of 
bed at least an hour before sun- 
rise. Find a spot with an unob- 
structed view to the east, and 
look in that direction. You will 
surely see a very bright object, 
fairly high in the sky. Ignore it. 
It isn’t Mercury, it is Venus. 
But below Venus, low on the 
horizon just before the sky be- 
gins to brighten, you should be 
able to spot another — lesser, 
but still bright — object; and 
that is what you are looking for. 

Find it? Then consider your- 
self one up on, for example, 
Copernicus — who spent all his 
life looking for Mercury, but was 
never able to find it at all. (He 
had the misfortune to spend most 
of his life in areas with consid- 
erable ground fog, it seems.) 
Seeing Vesta, on the other hand, 
puts you one up not only on 
Copernicus but on every other 
astronomer who lived from 
Eratosthenes to Olbers, who 
discovered it about a hundred 
and fifty odd years ago. But 
Olbers cheated. He used a tele- 
scope.

me. I was like the naked clay-

— sharpened on a stone — and 
carried now at last to the meet- 
ing for which it had been guard- 
ed over three years of waiting. 

A meeting in the cold rain of 
spring. I felt it, cold as old blood 
on my hands and tasteless on my 
lips. Above, the sky was low and 
clouds flowing to the east. The 
rain fell steadily. 

The sound of it was like a 
rolling of drums as I went down 
the outside landing stairs, the 
multitude of raindrops sounding 
[ their own end against the un- 
yielding concrete all around. The 
' concrete stretched far from the 
ship in every direction, hiding 
the earth, as bare and clean as 
the last page of an account book 
before the final entry. At its far 
edge, the spaceport terminal 
stood like a single gravestone. 
The curtains of falling water be- 
tween it and me thinned and 
thickened like the smoke of bat- 
tle, but could not hide it entire- 
ly from my sight. 

It was the same rain that falls 
in all places and on all worlds. 
It had fallen like this on Athens 
of Old Earth, when I was only 
a boy, on the dark, unhappy 
house of the uncle who brought 
me up after my parent’s death, 
on the ruins of the Parthenon as 
I saw it from my bedroom win- 
dow. 

I listened to it now as I went 
down the landing stairs, drum- 

8 



ming on the great ship behind 
me which had shifted me free 
between the stars — from Old 
Earth to this second smallest of 
the worlds, this small terraform- 
ed planet under the Procyon 
suns — and drumming hollowly 
upon the Credentials case slid- 
ing down the conveyor belt be- 
side me. That case now meant 
nothing to me — neither my 
papers or the Credentials of Im- 
partiality I had carried six years 
and worked so long to earn. Now 
I thought less of these than of 
the name of the man 1 should 
find dispatching groundcars at 
the edge of the field. If, that was, 
he was actually the man my 
Earth informants had named to 
me. And if they had not lied . 
“. Your luggage, sir?” 

T woke from my thoughts and 
the rain. I had reached the con- 
crete. The debarking officer smil- 
ed at me. He was older than I, 
though he looked younger. As he 
smiled some beads of moisture 
broke and spilled like tears from 
the brown visor-edge of his cap 
onto the tally sheet he held. 

“Send it to the Friendly com- 
pound,” I said. “I’ll take the 
Credentials case.” 

I took it up from the conveyor 
belt and turned to walk off. The 
man standing in a dispatcher’s 
uniform by the first groundcar in 
line did fit the description. 



GALAXY 



“Name, sir?” he said. “Bus- 
iness on St. Marie?” 

If he had been described to 
me, I must have been described 
to him. But I was prepared to 
humor him. 

“Tam Olyn,” I said. “Old 
Earth resident and Interworld 
News Network representative. 
I’m here to cover the Friendly- 
Exotic conflict.” I opened my 
case ^nd gave him my papers. 
j#|^*Fine, Mr. Olyn.” He handed 
em back to me, damp from the 
ain. He turned away to open 
e door of the car beside him 
and set the automatic pilot. “Fol- 
low the highway straight to Jo- 
seph’s Town. Put it on automatic 
at the city limits and the car’ll 
take you to the Friendly com- 
pound.” 

“All right,” I said. “Just a min- 
ute.” 

He turned back. He had a 
young, good-looking face with a 
little mustache and he looked at 
me with a bright blankness. 
“Sir?” 

“Help me get in the car.” 

“Oh, I’m sorry, sir.” He came 
quickly over to me. “I didn’t 
realize your leg — ” 

“Damp stiffens it,” I said. He 
adjusted the seat and I got my 
left leg in behind the steering 
column. He started to turn away. 

“Wait a minute,” I said again. 
I was out of patience. “You’re 
Walter Imera, aren’t you?” 



“Yes, sir,” he said softly. 

“Look at me,” I said. “You’ve 
got some information for me, 
haven’t you?” 

He turned slowly back to face 
me. His face was still blank. 

“No, sir.” 

I waited a long moment, look- 
ing at him. 

“All right,” I said then, reach- 
ing for the car door. “I guess you 
know I’ll get the information 
anyway. And they’ll believe you 
told me.” 

His little mustache began to 
look like it was painted on. 

“Wait — ” he said. 

“What for?” 

“Look,” he said, “you’ve got 
to understand. Information like 
that’s not part of your news, is 
it? I’ve got a family — ” 

“And I haven’t,” I said. I felt 
nothing for him. 

“But you don’t understand. 
They’d kill me. That’s the sort 
of organization the Blue Front 
is now, here on St. Marie. What 
d’you want to know about them 
for? I didn’t understand you 
meant — ” 

“All right,” I said. I reached 
for the car door. 

“Wait — ” He held out a hand 
to me in the rain. “How do I 
know you can make them leave 
me alone if I tell you?” 

“They may be back in power 
here some day,” I said. “Not 
even outlawed political groups 



10 



GALAXY 



want to antagonize the Inter- 
planetary News Network.” I 
started to close the door once 
more. 

“All right — ” he said quickly. 
“All right. You go to New San 
Marcos. The Wallace Street 
Jewelers there. It’s just beyond 
Joseph’s Town, where the 
Friendly compound is you’re go- 
ing to.” He licked his lips. 
“You’ll tell them about me?” 

“I’ll tell them.” I looked at 
him. Above the edge of the blue 
uniform collar on the right side 
of his neck I could see an inch or 
two of fine silver chain, bright 
against winter-pale skin. The 
crucifix attached to it would be 
down under his shirt. “The 
Friendly soldiers have been here 
two years now. How do people 
like them?” 

He grinned a little. His color 
was coming back. 

“Oh, like anybody,” he said. 
“You just have to understand 
them. They’ve got their own 
ways.” 

I felt the ache in my stiff leg 
where the doctors on New Earth 
had taken the needle from the 
spring rifle out of it three years 
before. 

“Yes, they have,” I said. 
“Shut the door.” 

He shut it. I drove off. 

nphere was a St. Christopher’s 
medal on the car’s instru- 



ment panel. One of the Friendly 
soldiers would have ripped it off 
and thrown it away, or refused 
the car. And so it gave me a par- 
ticular pleasure to leave it where 
it was, though it meant no more 
to me than it would to him. It 
was, not just because of Dave, 
my brother-in-law, and the other 
prisoners they had shot down on 
New Earth. It was simply be- 
cause there are some duties that 
have a small element of pleas- 
ure. After the illusions of child- 
hood are gone and there is noth- 
ing left but duties, such pleasures 
are welcome. Fanatics, when all 
is said and done, are no worse 
than mad dogs. 

But mad dogs have to be de- 
stroyed; it is a simple common 
sense. 

And you return to common 
sense after a while in life, inevit- 
ably. When the wild dreams of 
justice and progress are all dead 
and buried, when the painful 
beatings of feeling inside you are 
finally stilled, then it becomes 
best to be still, unliving, and un- 
yielding as — the blade of a sword 
sharpened on a stone. The rain 
through which such a blade is 
carried to its using does not 
stain it, any more than the blood 
in which it is bathed at last. Rain 
and blood are alike to sharpened 
iron. 

I drove for half an hour past 
wooded hills and plowed mead-

ows. The furrows of the fields 
were black in the rain. I thought 
it a kinder black than some other 
shades I had seen; and at last 
I reached the outskirts of Jo- 
seph’s Town. 

The autopilot of the car 
threaded me through a small, 
neat, typical St. Marie City of 
about a hundred thousand 
people. We came out on the far 
side into a cleared area, beyond 
which lifted the massive, sloping 
concrete walls of a military corn- 
s' pound. 

A Friendly non-com stopped 
my car at the gate with his black 
spring rifle, and opened the car 
door at my left. 

“Thee have business here?” 

His voice was harsh and high 
in his nose. The cloth tabs of a 
groupman edged his collar. 
Above them his forty-year-old 
face was lean and graven with 
lines. Both face and hands, the 
only uncovered parts of him, 
looked unnaturally white against 
the black cloth and rifle. 

I opened the case beside me 
and handed him my papers. 

“My Credentials,” I said. “I’m 
here to see your acting Com- 
mander of Expeditionary Forces, 
Commandant Jamethon Black.” 

“Move over, then,” he said 
nasally. “I must drive thee.” 

I moved. 

He got in and took the stick. 
We drove through the gate and 



turned down an approach alley. 
I could see an interior square at 
the alley’s far end. The close con- 
crete walls on either side of us 
echoed the sound of our passage 
as we went. I heard drill com- 
mands growing louder as we ap- 
proached the square. When we 
rolled out into it, soldiers were 
drawn up in ranks for their mid- 
day service, in the rain. 

nphe groupman left me and 
went in the entrance of what 
seemed to be an office inset in 
the wall on one side of the 
square. I looked over the soldiers 
standing in formation. They stood 
at present-arms, their position of 
worship under field conditions; 
and as I watched, the officer 
standing facing them, with his 
back to a wall, led them into the 
words of their Battle Hymn. 

Soldier, ask not — now or ever. 

Where to war yoor banners go. 

Anarch's legions, all surround us. 

Strike! And do not count the blow! 

I sat trying not to listen. There 
was no musical accompaniment, 
no religious furniture or symbols 
except the thin shape of the cross 
whitewashed on the gray wall 
behind the officer. The massed 
male voices rose and fell slowly 
in the dark, sad hymn that prom- 
ised them only pain, and suffer- 
ing, and sorrow. At last, the final 
line mourned its harsh prayer for 



12 



GALAXY 



a battle death, and they ordered 
arms. 

A groupman dismissed the 
ranks as the officer walked back 
past my car without looking at 
me, and passed in through the 
entrance where my non-com- 
missioned guide had disappeared. 
As he passed I saw the officer 
was young. 

A moment later the guide 
came for me. Limping a little 
on my stiffened leg, 1 followed 
him to an inner room with the 
lights on above a single desk. The 
young officer rose and nodded as 
the door closed behind me. He 
wore the faded tabs of a com- 
mandant on his uniform lapels. 

As I handed my credentials 
across the desk to him, the glare 
of the light over the desk came 
full in my eyes, blinding me. I 
stepped back and blinked at his 
blurred face. As it came back in- 
to focus I saw it for a moment 
as if it was older, harsher, twist- 
ed and engraved with the lines 
of years of fanaticism. 

Then my eyes refocused com- 
pletely, and I saw him as he 
actually was. Dark-faced, but 
thin with the thinness of youth 
rather than that of self-starva- 
tion. He was not the face burned 
in my memory. His features were 
regular to the point of being 
handsome, his eyes tired and 
shadowed ; and I saw the straight, 
weary line of his mouth above 



the still, self- controlled stiffness 
of his body, smaller and slighter 
than mine. 

He held the credentials with- 
out looking at them. His mouth 
quirked a little, dryly and wear- 
ily, at the corners. “And no 
doubt, Mr. Olyn,” he said, 
“you’ve got another pocket filled 
with authorities from the Exotic 
Worlds to interview the mercen- 
ary soldiers and officers they’ve 
hired from the Dorsai and a 
dozen other worlds to oppose 
God’s Chosen in War?” 

I smiled. Because it was good 
to find him as strong as that, to 
add to my pleasure of breaking 
him. 

II 

T looked across the ten feet or 
^ so of distance that separated 
us. The Friendly non-com who 
had killed the prisoners on New 
Earth had also spoken of God’s 
Chosen. 

“If you’ll look under the pap- 
ers directed to you,” I said, 
“you’ll find them. The News 
Network and its people are im- 
partial. We don’t take sides.” 
“Right,” said the dark young 
face opposing me, “takes sides.” 
“Yes, Commandant,” I said. 
“That’s right. Only sometimes 
it’s a matter of debate where 
Right is. You and your troops 
here now are invaders on the 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



13 



world of a planetary system your 
ancestors never colonized. And 
opposing you are mercenary 
troops hired by two worlds that 
not only belong under the Proc- 
yon suns but have a commitment 
to defend the smaller worlds of 
their system — of which St. Marie 
is one. I’m not sure right is on 
your side.” 

He shook his head slightly and 
said, “We expect small under- 
standing from those not Chosen.” 
He transferred his gaze from me 
to the papers in his hand. 

“Mind if I sit down?” I said. 
“I’ve got a bad leg.” 

“By all means.” He nodded to 
a chair beside his desk and, as 
I sat down, seated himself. I 
looked across the papers on the 
desk before him and saw, stand- 
ing to one side, the solidograph 
of one of the windowless high- 
peaked churches the Friendlies 
build. It was a legitimate token 
for him to own — but there just 
happened to be three people, an 
older man and woman and a 
young girl of about fourteen, in 
the foreground of the image. All 
three of them bore a family re- 
semblance to Jamethon Black. 
Glancing up from my credentials 
he saw me looking at them; and 
his gaze shifted momentarily to 
the graph and away again, as if 
he would protect it. 

“I’m required, I see,” he said, 
drawing my eyes back to him, 

14 



“to provide you with cooperation 
and facilities. We’ll find quarters 
for you here. Do you need a car 
and driver?” 

“Thanks,” I said. “That com- 
mercial car outside will do. And 
I’ll manage my own driving.” 

“As you like.” He detached tha 
papers directed to him, passed 
the rest back to me and leaned 
toward a grill in his desktop. 
“Groupman.” 

“Sir,” the grill answered 
promptly. 

“Quarters for a single male 
civilian. Parking assignment for 
a civilian vehicle, personnel.” 

“Sir.” 

The voice from the grill clicked 
off. Jamethon Black looked 
across his desk at me. I got the 
idea he was waiting for my de- 
parture. 

“Commandant,” I said, putting 
my credentials back in their 
case, “two years ago your Elders 
of the United Churches on Har- 
mony and Association found the 
planetary government of St. 
Marie in default of certain dis- 
puted balances of credit, so they 
sent an expedition in here to 
occupy and enforce payment. Of 
that expedition, how much in the 
way of men and equipment do 
you have left?” 

“That, Mr. Olyn,” he said, “is 
restricted military information.” 

“However — ” and I closed the 
case • — “you, with the regular 



GALAXY 



rank of commandant, are acting 
Commander of Forces for that 
remnants of your expedition. 
That position calls for someone 
about five ranks higher than you. 
Do you expect such an officer to 
arrive and take charge?” 

“I’m afraid you’d have to ask 
that question of Headquarters 
on Harmony, Mr. Olyn.” 

“Do you expect reinforcements 
of personnel and more supplies?” 
“If I did — ” his voice was level 
— “I would have to consider that 
restricted information, too.” 
“You know that it’s been pret- 
ty widely mentioned that your 
General Staff on Harmony has 
decided that this expedition to 
St. Marie is a lost cause? But 
that to avoid loss of face they 
prefer you here to be cut up, in- 
stead of withdrawing you and 
your men.” 

“I see,” he said. 

“You wouldn’t care to com- 
ment?” 

His dark, young, expression- 
less face did not change. “Not 
in the case of rumors, Mr. Olyn.” 
“One last question then. Do 
you plan to retreat westward, or 
surrender when the spring of- 
fensive of the Exotic mercenary 
forces begins to move against 
you?” 

“The Chosen in War never re- 
treat,” he said. “Neither do they 
abandon, or suffer abandonment 
by, their Brothers in the Lord.” 



He stood up. “I have work I must 
get back to, Mr. Olyn.” 

I stood up, too. I was taller 
than he was, older, and heavier- 
boned. It was only his almost un- 
natural composure that enabled 
him to maintain his appearance 
of being my equal or better. , 
“I’ll talk to you later, perhaps, 
when you’ve got more time,” I 
said. 

“Certainly.” I heard the office 
door open behind me. “Group- 
man,” he said, speaking past me, 
“take care of Mr. Olyn.” 

'"T''he groupman he had turned 
me over to found me a 
small concrete cubicle with a 
single high window, a camp bed 
and a uniform cabinet. He left 
me for a moment and returned 
with a signed pass. 

“Thanks,” I said as I took it. 
“Where do I find the Headquar- 
ters of the Exotic Forces?” 

“Our latest advices, sir,” he 
said, “is that they’re ninety kil- 
ometers east of here. New San 
Marcos.” He was my height, but, 
like most of them, half a dozen 
years younger than I, with an in- 
nocence that contrasted with the 
strange air of control they all 
had. 

“San Marcos.” I looked at him. 
“I suppose you enlisted men 
know your General Headquarters 
on Harmony has decided against 
wasting replacements for you?” 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT

“No, sir,” he said. I might have 
commented on the rain for all 
the reaction he showed. Even 
these boys were still strong and 
unbroken. “Is there somewhat 
else?” 

“No,” I said. "Thanks.” 

He went out. And I went out, 
to get in my car and head ninety 
kilometers east through the same 
sort of country to New San Mar- 
cos. I reached it in about three- 
quarters of an hour. But I did 
not go directly to find the Ex- 
otic Field Headquarters. I had 
other fish to fry. 

These took me to the Wallace 
Street Jewelers. There, three 
shallow steps down from street 
level and an opaqued door let 
me in to a long, dim-lighted room 
filled with glass cases. There was 
a small elderly man at the back 
of the store behind the final case 
and I saw him eyeing my cor- 
respondent’s cloak and badge as 
I got closer. 

“Sir?” he said, as I stopped 
across the case from him. He 
raised gray, narrow old eyes in a 
strangely smooth face to look at 
me. 

“I think you know what I rep- 
resent,” I said. “All worlds know 
the News Services. We’re not 
concerned with local politics.” 

“Sir?” 

“You’ll find out how I learned 
your address anyway,” I kept on 
smiling at him. “So 111 tell you 



it was from a spaceport auto- 
dispatcher named Imera. I prom- 
ised him protection for telling 
me. We’d appreciate it if he re- 
mains well and whole.” 

“I’m afraid — ” He put his 
hands on the glass top of the 
case. They were veined with the 
years. “You wanted to buy some- 
thing?” 

“I’m willing to pay in good 
will,” I said, “for information.” 
His hands slid off the counter- 
top. 

“Sir.” He sighed a little. “I’m 
afraid you’re in the wrong store.” 
“I’m sure I am,” I said. “But 
your store’ll have to do. We’ll 
pretend it’s the right store and 
I’m talking to someone who’s a 
member of the Blue Front.” 

He shook his head slowly and 
stepped back from the case. 

“The Blue Front is illegal,” 
he said. “Good-by, sir.” 

“In a moment. I’ve got a few 
filings to say first.” 

“Then I’m sorry.” He retreat- 
ed toward some drapes covering 
a doorway. “I can’t listen. No one 
will come into this room with 
you, sir, as long as you talk like 
that.” 

He slipped through the drapes 
and was gone. I looked around 
the long, empty room. 

“Well,” I said, a little more 
loudly, “I guess I’ll have to speak 
to the walls. I’m sure the walls 
can hear me.”

I paused. There was no sound. 

“All right,” I said. “I’m a cor- 
respondent. All I’m interested in 
is information. Our assessment of 
the military situation here on 
St. Marie — ” and here I told the 
truth — “shows the Friendly Ex- 
peditionary Forces abandoned 
by their home headquarters and 
certain to be overrun by the Ex- 
otic Forces as soon as the ground 
dries enough for heavy equip- 
ment to move.” 

There was still no answer, but 
the back of my neck knew they 
were listening, and watching me. 

“As a result,” I went on — and 
here I lied, though they would 
have no way of knowing — “we 
consider it inevitable that the 
Friendly Command here will 
have got in contact with the Blue 
Front. Assassination of enemy 
commanders is expressly in 
violation of the Mercenaries’ 
Code and the Articles of Civil- 
ized Warfare — but civilians 
could do what soldiers could 
not.” 

Still there was no sound or 
movement beyond the drapes. 

“A news representative,” I 
said, “carries Credentials of Im- 
partiality. You know how highly 
these are held. I only want to 
ask a few questions. And the an- 
swers will be kept confiden- 
tial . .” 

For a last time I waited, and 
there was still no answer. I 



turned and went up the long 
room and out. It was not until 
I was well out on to the street 
that I let the feeling of triumph 
within spread out and warm me. 

They would take the bait. 
People of their sort always did. 
I found my car and drove to Ex- 
otic Headquarters. 

'Tphese were outside the town. 

-*■ There a mercenary com- 
mandant named Janol Marat 
took me in charge. He conducted 
me to the bubble structure of 
their HQ building. There was a 
feel of purpose, there, a sure and 
cheerful air of activity. They 
were well armed, well trained. 
After the Friendlies it jumped 
at me. I said so to Janol. 

“We’ve got a Dorsai Com- 
mander and we outnumber the 
opposition.” He grinned at me. 
He had a deeply tanned, long 
face that went into deep creases 
as his lips curved up. “That 
makes everybody pretty optim- 
istic. Besides, our commander 
gets promoted if he wins. Back 
to the Exotics and staff rank — 
out of field combat for good. 
It’s good business for us to win.” 

I laughed and he laughed. 

“Tell me more, though,” I said. 
“I want reasons I can use in the 
stories I send back to News Net- 
work.” 

“Well — ” he answered the 
snappy salute of a passing group-

man, a Cassidan, by the look of 
him — “I guess you might men- 
tion the usual — the fact our Ex- 
otic employers don’t permit 
themselves to use violence and 
consequently they’re always 
rather generous than otherwise 
when it comes to paying for men 
and equipment. And the Out- 
Bond — that’s the Exotic Ambas- 
sador to St. Marie, you know — ” 

“I know.” 

“He replaced the former Out- 
Bond here three years ago. Any- 
way, he’s something special, even 
for someone from Mara or Kul- 
tis. He’s an expert in ontogenic 
calculations. If that means much 
to you. It’s all over my head.” 
Janol pointed. “Here’s the Field 



Commander’s office. He’s Kensie 
Graeme.” 

“Graeme?” I said, frowning. 
I had spent a day at the Hague 
looking up Kensie Graeme be- 
fore I came, but I wanted Janol’s 
reactions to him. “Sounds famil- 
iar.” We approached the office 
building. “Graeme . .” 

“You’re probably thinking erf 
another member of the same 
family.” Janol took the bait. 
“Donal Graeme. A nephew. The 
one who pulled that wild stunt 
not long ago, attacking Newton 
with just a handful of Freiland 
ships. Kensie is Donal’s uncle. 
Not as spectacular as the young 
Graeme, but I’ll bet you’ll like 
him better than you would the

nephew. Kensie’s got two men’s 
likeableness.” He looked at me, 
grinning slightly again. 

“That supposed to mean some- 
thing special?” I said. 

“That’s right,” said Janol. “His 
own likeableness and his twin 
brother’s, too. Meet Ian Graeme 
sometime when you’re in Blau- 
vain. That’s where the Exotic 
embassy is, east of here. Ian’s a 
dark man.” 

We walked into the office. 

“I can’t get used,” I said, “to 
how so many Dorsai seem re- 
lated.” 

“Neither can I. Actually, I 
guess it’s because there really 
aren’t so many of them. The 
Dorsai’s a small world, and those 



that live more than a few 
years — ” Janol stopped by a 
commandant sitting at a desk. 
“Can we see the Old Man, Hari? 
This is a News Network man.” 
“Why, I guess so.” The other 
looked at his desk signal board. 
“The OutBonds with him, but 
he’s just leaving now. Go on in.” 
Janol led me between the 
desks. A door at the back of 
the room opened before we 
reached it and a calm-faced man 
of middle age wearing a blue 
robe and close-cropped white 
hair came out. He looked strange 
but not ridiculous — particularly 
after you met his odd, hazel- 
colored eyes. 

He was an Exotic.

T knew of Padma, as I knew 
the Exotics. I had seen them 
on their own home worlds of 
Mara and Kultis. A people com- 
mitted to non-violence, mystics 
but very practical mystics, mas- 
ters of what were known as the 
“strange sciences” — a dozen wiz- 
ardic step-children of early psy- 
chology, sociology and the hu- 
manistic fields of research. 

“Sir,” said Janol to Padma, 
“this is—” 

“Tam Olyn. I know,” said 
Padma softly. He smiled up at 
me, and those eyes of his seemed 
to catch light for a moment and 
blind me. “I was sorry to learn 
about your brother-in-law, 
Tam.” 

I went quite cool all over. I 
had been ready to walk on, but 
now I stood stock still and looked 
at him. 

“My brother-in-law?” I said. 

“The young man who died 
near Castlemain, on New Earth.” 

“Oh, yes,” I said, between stiff 
lips. “Pm surprised that you’d 
know.” 

“I know because of you, Tam.” 
Once more the hazel eyes of 
Fadma seemed to catch light. 
“We have a science called onto- 
genies, by which we calculate 
the probabilities of human ac- 
tions in present and future situa- 
tions. You’ve been an important 
factor in those calculations for 
some time.” He smiled. “That’s 



why I was expecting to meet 
you here, and now. We’ve cal- 
culated you into our present sit- 
uation here on St. Marie, Tam.” 
“Have you?” I said. “Have 
you? That’s interesting.” 

“I thought it would be,” said 
Padma softly. “To you, espec- 
ially. Someone like a newsman, 
like yourself, would find it inter- 
esting.” 

“It is,” I said. “It sounds like 
you know more than I do about 
what I’m going to be doing here.” 
“We’ve got calculations,” said 
Padma in his soft voice, “to that 
effect. Come see me in Blauvain, 
Tam; and I’ll show you.” 

“I’ll do that,” I said. 

“You’ll be very welcome.” 
Padma inclined his head. His 
blue robe whispered on the floor 
as he turned, and went out of the 
room. 

“This way,” said Janol, touch- 
ing my elbow. I started as if I 
had just wakened from a deep 
sleep. “The commander’s in 
here.” 

I followed him automatically 
into a further office. The indi- 
vidual I had come to see stood 
up as we came through the door. 
He was a great, lean man in field 
uniform, with a heavy-boned, but 
open, smiling face under black, 
slightly curly hair. A sort of 
golden warmth of personality — 
a strange thing in a Dorsai — 
seemed to flow out from him as 



20

he rose to meet me and his long- 
fingered, powerful hand swal- 
lowed mine in a handshake. 

“Come on in,” he said. “Let 
me fix you up with a drink. 
Janol,” he added to my mercen- 
ary commandant from New 
Earth, “no need for you to stick 
around. Go on to chow. And tell 
the rest of them in the outer 
office to knock off.” 

Janol saluted and went. I sat 
down as Graeme turned to a 
small bar cabinet behind his 
desk. And for the first time in 
three years, under the magic of 
the unusual fighting man op- 
posite me, a little peace came 
into my soul. With someone like 
this on my side, I could not lose. 

Ill 

4 4 /credentials?” asked Graeme, 
as soon as we were settled 
with drinks of Dorsai whisky — 
which is a fine whisky — in our 
hands. 

1 passed my papers over. He 
glanced through them, picking 
out the letters from Sayona, the 
Bond of Kultis, to “Commander 
— St. Marie Field Forces." He 
looked these over and put them 
aside. He handed me back the 
credentials folder. 

“You stopped at Joseph’s 
Town first?” he said. 

I nodded. I saw him looking at 
my face, and his own sobered. 



“You don’t like the Friend- 
lies,” he said. 

His words took my breath 
away. I had come prepared to 
fence for an opening to tell him. 
It was too sudden. I looked 
away. 

I did not dare answer right 
away. I could not. There was 
either too much or too little to 
say if I let it come out without 
thinking. Then I got a grip on 
myself. 

“If I do anything at all with 
the rest of my life,” I said, slow- 
ly, “it’ll be to do everything in 
my power to remove the Friend- 
lies and all they stand for from 
the community of civilized hu- 
man beings.” 

I looked back up at him. He 
was sitting with one massive el- 
bow on his desktop, watching me. 

“That’s a pretty harsh point of 
view, isn’t it?” 

“No harsher than theirs.” 

“Do you think so?” he said 
seriously. “I wouldn’t say so.” 

“I thought,” I said, “you were 
the one who was fighting them.” 

“Why, yes.” He smiled a little. 
“But we’re soldiers on both 
sides.” 

“I don’t think they think that 
way.” 

He shook his head a little. 

“What makes you say that?” 
he said. 

“I’ve seen them,” I answered. 
“I got caught up front in the

lines on Castlemain on New 
Earth, three years ago.” I tapped 
my stiff knee. “I got shot and I 
couldn’t navigate. The Cassidans 
around me began to retreat — 
they were mercenaries, and the 
troops opposing them were 
Friendlies hired out as mercenar- 
ies.” 

I stopped and took a drink of 
the whisky. When I took the 
glass away, Graeme had not 
moved. He sat as if waiting. 

“There was young Cassidan, 
a buck soldier,” I said. “I was 
doing a series on the campaign 
from an individual point of view. 
I’d picked him for my individual. 
It was a natural choice. You 
see — ” I drank again, and emp- 
tied the glass — “my younger 
sister went out on contract as an 
accountant to Cassida two years 
before that, and she’d married 
him. He was my brother-in-law.” 

raeme took the glass from 
my hand and silently re- 
plenished it. 

“He wasn’t actually a military 
man,” I said. “He was studying 
shift mechanics and he had about 
three years to go. But he stood 
low on one of the competitive ex- 
aminations at a time when Cas- 
sida owed a contractual balance 
of troops to New Earth.” I took 
a deep breath. “Well, to make 
a long story short, he ended up 
on New Earth in this same cam- 



paign I was covering. Because 
of the series I was writing, he 
was assigned to me. We both 
thought it was a good deal for 
him, that he’d be safer that 
way.” 

I drank some more of the 
whisky. 

“But,” I said, “you know, 
there’s always a better story a 
little deeper in the combat zone. 
We got caught up front one day 
when the New Earth troops were 
retreating. I picked up a needle 
through the kneecap. The 
Friendly armor was moving up 
and things were getting hot. The 
soldiers around us took off to- 
ward the rear in a hurry, but 
Dave tried to carry me, because 
he thought the Friendly armor 
would fry me before they had 
time to notice I was a non-com 
batant. Well,” I took another 
deep breath, “the Friendly 
ground troops caught us. They 
took us to a sort of clearing 
where they had a lot of prison- 
ers and kept us there for a while. 
Then a groupman — one of their 
fanatic types, a tall, starved-look- 
ing soldier about my age — came 
up with orders they were to re- 
form for a fresh attack.” 

I stopped and took another 
drink. But I could not taste it. 

“That meant they couldn’t 
spare men to guard the prisoners. 
They’d have to turn them loose 
back of the Friendly lines. The 



22 



GALAXY 



Groupman said that wouldn’t 
work. They’d have to make sure 
the prisoners couldn’t endanger 
them.” 

Graeme was still watching me. 

“I didn’t understand. I didn’t 
even catch on when the other 
Friendlies — none of them were 
non-coms like the Groupman — 
objected.” I put my glass on the 
desk beside me and stared at the 
wall of the office, seeing it all 
over again, as plainly as if I 
looked through a window at it. 
“I remember how the Groupman 
pulled himself up straight. I saw 
his eyes. As if he’d been insulted 
by the others, objecting. 

“ ‘Are they Chosen ot God '?* ” 
he shouted at them. ‘Are they of 
the Chosen F ” 

I looked across at Kensie 
Graeme and saw him still mo- 
tionless, still watching me, his 
own glass small in one big hand. 

“You understand?” I said to 
him. “as if because the prisoners 
weren’t Friendlies, they weren’t 
quite human. As if they were 
some lower order it was all right 
to kill.” I shook, suddenly. “And 
he did it! I sat there against a 
tree, safe because of my News 
Correspondent’s uniform and 
watched him shoot them down. 
All of them. I sat there and look- 
ed at Dave, and he looked at me, 
sitting there, as the Groupman 
shot him!” 

I quit all at once. I hadn’t 



meant to have it all come out 
like that. It was just that I’d 
been able to tell no one who 
would understand how helpless 
I had been. But something about 
Graeme had given me the idea 
he would understand. 

“Yes,” he said after a moment, 
and took and filled my glass 
again. “That sort of thing’s very 
bad. Was the Groupman found 
and tried under the Mercenaries 
Code?” 

“After it was too late, yes.” 

H e nodded and looked past me 
at the wall. “They aren’t all 
like that, of course.” 

“There’s enough to give them 
a reputation for it.” 

“Unfortunately, yes. Well” — 
he smiled slightly at me — “we’ll 
try and keep that sort of thing 
out of this campaign.” 

“Tell me something,” I said, 
putting my glass down. “Does 
that sort of thing — as you put 
it — ever happen to the Friend- 
lies, themselves?” 

Something took place then in 
the atmosphere of the room. 
There was a little pause before 
he answered. I felt my heart beat 
slowly, three times, as I waited 
for him to speak. 

He said at last, “No, it doesn’t.” 
“Why not?” I said. 

The feeling in the room be- 
came stronger. And I realized I 
had gone too fast. I had been

sitting talking to him as a man 
and forgetting what else he was. 
Now I began to forget that he 
was a man and become conscious 
of him as a Dorsai — an indivi- 
dual as human as I was, but 
trained all his life, and bred 
down the generations to a dif- 
ference. He did not move or 
change the tone of his voice, or 
any such thing; but somehow he 
seemed to move off some dis- 
tance from me, up into a higher, 
colder, stonier land into which I 
could venture only at my peril. 

I remembered what was said 
about his people from that small, 
cold stony-mountained world ; 
that if the Dorsai chose to with- 
draw their fighting men from the 
services of all the other worlds, 
and challenge those other worlds, 
not the combined might of the 
rest of civilization could stand 
against them. I had never really 
believed that before. I had never 
even really thought much about 
it. But sitting there just then, 
because of what was happening 
in the room, suddenly it became 
real to me. I could feel the 
knowledge, cold as a wind blow- 
ing on me off a glacier, that it 
was true; and then he answered 
my question. 

“Because,” said Kensie Grae- 
me. “anything like that is spe- 
cifically prohibited by Article 
Two of the Mercenaries’ Code.” 

Then he broke out abruptly 



into a smile and what I had just 
felt in the room withdrew. I 
breathed again. 

“Well,” he said, putting his 
glass down empty on the desk, 
“how about joining us in the 
Officers’ Mess for something to 
eat?” 

T had dinner with them and the 
■*- meal was very pleasant. They 
wanted to put me up for the 
night — but I could feel myself 
being pulled back to that cold, 
joyless compound near Joseph’s 
Town, where all that waited for 
me was a sort of cold and bitter 
satisfaction at being among my 
enemies. 

I went back. 

It was about eleven p.m. when 
I drove through the gate of the 
compound and parked, just as a 
figure came out of the entrance 
to Jamethon’s headquarters. The 
square was dim-lighted with only 
a few spotlights about the walls, 
their light lost in the rain-wet 
pavement. For a moment I did 
not recognize the figure — and 
then I saw it was Jamethon. 

He would have passed by me 
at some little distance, but I got 
out of my car and went to meet 
him. He stopped when I stepped 
in front of him. 

“Mr. Olyn,” he said evenly. In 
the darkness I could not make 
out the expression of his face. 

“I’ve got a question to ask,” 



24 



GALAXY 



I said, smiling in the darkness. 
“It’s late for questions.” 
“This won’t take long.” I 
strained to catch the look on his 
face, but it was all in shadow. 
“I’ve been visiting the Exotic 
camp. Their commander’s a Dor- 
sai. I suppose you know that?” 
“Yes.” I could barely see the 
movement of his lips. 

“We got to talking. A question 
came up and I thought I’d ask 
you, Commandant. Do you ever 
order your men to kill prison- 
ers?” 

An odd, short silence came be- 
tween us. Then he answered. 

“The killing or abuse of prison- 
ers of war,” he said without emo- 
tion, “is forbidden by Article 
Two of the Mercenaries’ Code.” 
“But you aren’t Mercenaries 
here, are you? You’re native 
troops in service to your own 
True Church and Elders.” 

“Mr. Olyn,” he said, while I 
still strained without success to 
make out the expression of his 
shadowed face — and it seemed 
that the words came slowly, 
though the tone of the voice 
that spoke them remained as 
calm as ever, “My Lord has set 
me to be His servant and a lead- 
er among men of war. In neither 
of those tasks will I fail Him.” 
And with that he turned, his 
face still shadowed and hidden 
from me, and passed around me 
and went on. 



\ lone, I went back inside to 
my quarters, undressed and 
lay down on the hard and narrow 
bed they had given me. The rain 
outside had stopped at last. 
Through my open, unglazed win- 
dow I could see a few stars show- 
ing. 

I lay there getting ready to 
sleep and making mental notes 
on what I would need to do 
tomorrow. The meeting with Pad- 
ma the OutBond had jolted me 
sharply. I took his so-called cal- 
culations of human actions with 
reservation — but I had been 
shaken to learn of them. I would 
have to find out more about hojv 
much his science of ontogenies 
knew and could predict. If neces- 
sary, from Padma himself. But 
I would start first with ordinary 
reference sources. 

No one, I thought, would or- 
dinarily entertain the fantastic 
thought that one man like myself 
could destroy a culture involving 
the populations of two worlds. 
No one, except perhaps a Padma. 
What I knew, he with his calcu- 
lations might have discovered. 
And that was that the Friendly 
worlds of Harmony and Associa- 
tion were facing a decision that 
would mean life or death to their 
way of living. A very small thing 
could tip the scales they weighed 
on. 

For there was a new wind 
blowing between the stars. 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



25 



Four hundred years before we 
had all been men of Earth — 
Old Earth, the mother planet 
which was my native soil. One 
people. 

Then, with the movement out 
to new worlds, the human race 
had “splintered”, to use an Exotic 
term. Every small social frag- 
ment and psychological type had 
drawn apart by itself, and joined 
others like it and progressed to- 
ward specialized types. Until we 
had half a dozen fragments of 
human types — the warrior on 
the Dorsai, the philosopher on 
the Exotic worlds, the hard scien- 
tist on Newton, Cassida and 
Venus, and so forth . 

Isolation had bred specific 
types. Then a growing intercom- 
munication between the younger 
worlds, now established, and an 
ever-increasing rate of technolo- 
gical advance had forced special- 
ization. The trade between the 
worlds was the trade of skilled 
minds. Generals from the Dorsai 
were worth their exchange rate 
in psychiatrists from the Exotics. 
Communications men like my- 
self from Old Earth bought 
spaceship designers from Cassida. 
And so it had been for the last 
hundred years. 

But now the worlds were drift- 
ing together. Economics was fus- 
ing the race into one whole, 
again. And the struggle on each 
world was to gain the advantages 



of that fusion while holding on 
to as much as possible of their 
own ways. 

Compromise was necessary — 
and the harsh, stiff-necked 
Friendly religion forbade com- 
promise and had made many 
enemies. Already public opinion 
moved against the Friendlies on 
other worlds. Discredit them, 
smear them, publicly here in this 
campaign and they would not 
be able to hire out their soldiers. 
They would lose the balance of 
trade they needed to hire the 
skilled specialists trained by the 
special facilities of other worlds, 
and which they needed to keep 
their own two poor-in-natural - 
resources worlds alive. They 
would die. 

As young Dave had died. Slow- 
ly. In the dark. 

... In the darkness now, as 
I thought of it, it rose up before 
me once again. It had been only 
noon when we were taken prison- 
er, but by the time the Group - 
man came with his orders for 
our guards to move up, the sun 
was almost down. 

After they left, after it was all 
over and I was left alone, I 
crawled to the bodies in the 
clearing. And I found Dave 
among them; and he was not 
quite gone. 

He was wounded in the body 
and I could not stop the bleeding. 

It would not have helped if I 



26 



GALAXY 



had, they told me afterwards. 
But then it seemed that it would 
have. So I tried. But finally I 
gave up and by that time it was 
quite dark. I only held him and 
did not know he was dead until 
he began to grow cold. And then 
was when I had begun to change 
into what my uncle had always 
tried to make me. I felt myself 
die inside. Dave and my sister 
were to have been my family, 
the only family I had ever had 
hopes of keeping. Instead, I could 
only sit there in the darkness, 
holding him and hearing the 
blood from his red-soaked cloth- 
ing, falling drop by drop, slowly 
on the dead variform oak leaves 
beneath us. 

¥ lay there now in the Friendly 
compound, not able to sleep 
and remembering. And after a 
while I heard the soldiers march- 
ing, forming in the square for 
midnight service. 

I lay on my back, listening to 
them. Their marching feet stop- 
ped at last. The single window of 
my room was over my bed — 
high in the wall against which 
the left side of my cot was set. It 
was unglazed and the night air 
with its sounds came freely 
through it along with the dim 
light from the square which 
painted a pale rectangle on the 
opposite wall of my room. I lay 
watching that rectangle and lis- 



tening to the service outside; and 
I heard the duty officer lead 
them in a prayer for worthiness. 
After that they sang their battle 
hymn again, and I lay hearing it, 
this time, all the way through. 

Soldier, ask not — now, or ever. 

Where to war your banners go. 

Anarch's legions all surround us. 

Strike — and do not count the bow. 

Glory, honor — praise and profit. 

Are but toys of tinsel worth. 

Render up your work, unasking. 

Leave the human clay to earth. 

Blood and sorrow — pain unending. 

Are the portion of us all. 

Grasp the naked sword, opposing. 
Gladly in the battle fall. 

So shall we, anointed soldiers. 

Stand at last before the Throne. 

Baptized in our wounds, red-flowing. 
Sealed unto our Lord — alone! 

After that they dispersed to 
cots no different from mine. 

I lay there listening to the 
silence in the square and the 
measured dripping of a rain- 
spout outside by my window, its 
slow drops falling after the rain, 
one by one, uncounted in the 
darkness. 

IV 

A fter the day I landed, there 
was no more rain. Day by 
day the fields dried. Soon they 
would be firm underneath the 
weight of heavy surface-war

equipment, and everyone knew 
that then the Exotic spring of- 
fensive would get under way. 
Meanwhile both Exotic and 
Friendly troops were in training. 

During the next few weeks, I 
was busy about my newswork. 
Mostly feature and small stories 
on the soldiers and the native 
people. I had dispatches to send 
and I sent them faithfully. A 
correspondent is only as good as 
his contacts; I made contacts 
everywhere but among the 
Friendly troops. These remained 
aloof, though I talked to many 
of them. They refused to show 
fear or doubt. 

I had heard these Friendly 
soldiers were generally under- 
trained because the suicidal tac- 
tics of their officers kept their 
ranks always filled with green 
replacements. But the ones here 
were the remnants of an Expedi- 
tionary Force six times their pre- 
sent numbers. They were all vet- 
erans, though most of them were 
in their teens. Only here and 
there, among the non-coms, and 
more often among the commis- 
sioned officers, I saw the proto- 
type of the non-com who had 
ordered the prisoners shot on 
New Earth. Here, the men of 
this type looked like rabid, gray 
wolves mixed among polite, well- 
schooled young dogs just out of 
puppyhood. 

It was a temptation to think 



that they alone were what I had 
set out to destroy. 

To fight that temptation I told 
myself that Alexander the Great 
had led expeditions against the 
hill tribes and ruled in Pella, 
capital of Macedonia, and order- 
ed men put to death when he 
was sixteen. But still the Friend- 
ly soldiers looked young to me. I 
could not help contrasting them 
with the adult, experienced mer- 
cenaries in Kensie Graeme’s 
forces. For the Exotics, in obe- 
dience to their principles, would 
hire no drafted troops or soldiers 
who were not in uniform of their 
own free will. 

Meanwhile I had heard no 
word from the Blue Front. But 
by the time two weeks had gone, 
I had my own connections in 
New San Marcos, and at the 
beginning of the third week one 
of these brought me word that 
the jewelers shop in Wallace 
Street there had closed its door 
— had pulled its blinds and emp- 
tied the long room of stock and 
fixtures, and moved or gone out 
of business. That was all I need- 
ed to know. 

For the next few days, I stay- 
ed in the vicinity of Jamethon 
Black himself, and by the end 
of the week my watching him 
paid off. 

At ten o’clock that Friday 
night I was up on a catwalk 
just above my quarters and 



28 



GALAXY 



under the sentry-walk of the 
walls, watching as three civil- 
ians with Blue Front written all 
over them drove into the square, 
got out and went into Jame- 
thon’s office. 

They stayed a little over an 
hour. When they left, I went 
back down to bed. That night I 
slept soundly. 

nr'he next morning I got up 
early, and there was mail for 
me. A message had come by 
spaceliner from the director of 
News Network back on Earth, 
personally congratulating me on 
my dispatches. Once, three years 
before, this would have meant a 
great deal to me. Now, I only 
worried that they would decide 
I had made the situation here 
newsworthy enough to require 
extra people being sent out to 
help me. I could not risk having 
other news personnel here now 
to see what I was doing. 

I got in my car and headed 
east along the highway to New 
San Marcos and the Exotic 
Headquarters. The Friendly 
troops were already out in the 
field; eighteen kilometers east of 
Joseph’s Town, I was stopped by 
a squad of five young soldiers 
with no non-com over them. 
They recognized me. 

“In God’s name, Mr. Olyn,’’ 
said the first one to reach my 
car, bending down to speak to 




SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



29 



me through the open window at 
my left shoulder. “You cannot go 
through.” 

“Mind if I ask why?” I said. 

He turned and pointed out 
and down into a little valley be- 
tween two wooded hills at our 
left. 

“Tactical survey in progress,” 

I looked. The little valley or 
meadow was perhaps a hundred 
yards wide between the wooded 
slopes, and it wound away from 
me and curved to disappear to my 
right. At the edge of the wooded 
slopes where they met open 
meadow, there were lilac bushs 
with blossoms several days old. 
The meadow itself was green and 
fair with the young chartreuse 
grass of early summer and the 
white and purple of the lilacs, 
and the variform oaks behind the 
lilacs were fuzzy in outline, with 
small, new leaves. 

In the middle of all this, in 
the center of the meadow, were 
black-clad figures moving about 
with computing devices, measur- 
ing and figuring the possibilities 
of death from every angle. In 
the very center of the meadow for 
some reason they had set up 
marking stakes — a single stake, 
then a stake in front of that with 
two stakes on either side of it, 
and one more stake in line before 
these. Farther on was another 
single stake, down, as if fallen 
on the grass and discarded. 



I looked back up into the lean 
young face of the soldier. 

“Getting ready to defeat th» 
Exotics?” I said. 

He took it as if it had been 
a straightforward question, with 
no irony in my voice at all. 

“Yes sir,” he said seriously. 
I looked at him and at the taut 
skin and clear eyes of the rest. 

“Ever think you might lose?” 

“No, Mr. Olyn.” He shook his 
head solemnly. “No man loses 
who goes to battle for the Lord.” 
He saw that I needed to be con- 
vinced, and he went about it 
earnestly. “He hath set His hand 
upon His soldiers. And all that 
is possible to them is victory — ■ 
or sometimes death. And what 
is death?” 

He looked to his fellow sol- 
diers and they all nodded. 

“What is death?” they echoed. 

I looked at them. They stood 
there asking me and each other 
what was death as if they were 
talking about some hard but 
necessary job. 

I had an answer for them, but 
I did not say it. Death was a 
Groupman, one of their own 
kind, giving orders to soldiers 
just like themselves to assassin- 
ate prisoners. That was death. 

“Call an officer,” I said. “My 
pass lets me through here.” 

“I regret, sir,” said the one 
who had been talking to me. “We 
cannot leave our posts to sum- 



30 



GALAXY 



mon an officer. One will come 
soon.” 

1 had a hunch what “soon” 
meant, and I was right. It was 
high noon before a Force Leader 
came by to order them to chow 
and let me through. 

A s I pulled into Kensie Grae- 
me’s Headquarters, the sun 
was low, patterning the ground 
with the long shadows of trees. 
Yet it was as if the camp was 
just waking up. I did not need 
experience to see the Exotics 
were beginning to move at last 
against Jamethon. 

I found Janol Marat, the New 
Earth commandant. 

“I’ve got to see Field Com- 
mander Graeme,” I said. 

He shook his head, for all that 
we now knew each other well. 

“Not now, Tarn. I’m sorry.” 

“Janol,” I said, “this isn’t for 
an interview. It’s a matter of 
life and death. I mean that. I’ve 
got to see Kensie.” 

He stared at me. I stared back. 

“Wait here,” he said. We were 
standing just inside the head- 
quarters office. He went out and 
was gone for perhaps five min- 
utes. I stood, listening to the wall 
clock ticking away. Then he 
came back. 

“This way,” he said. 

He led me outside and back 
between the bubble roundness of 
the plastic buildings to a small 



structure half-hidden in some 
trees. When we stepped through 
its front entrance, I realized it 
was Kensie’s personal quarters. 
We passed through a small sit- 
ting room into a combination 
bedroom and bath. Kensie had 
just stepped out of the shower 
and was getting into battle 
clothes. He looked at me curious- 
ly, then turned his gaze back on 
Janol. 

“All right, Commandant,” he 
said, “you can get back to your 
duties, now.” 

“Sir,” said Janol, without look- 
ing at me. 

He saluted and left. 

“All right, Tam,” Kensie said, 
pulling on a pair of uniform 
slacks. “What is it?” 

“I know you’re ready to move 
out,” I said. 

He looked at me a little humor- 
ously as he locked the waistband 
of his slacks. He had not yet put 
on his shirt, and in that relative- 
ly small room he loomed like a 
giant, like some irresistible na- 
tural force. His body was tanned 
like dark wood and the muscles 
lay in flat bands across his chest 
and shoulders. His belly was hol- 
low and the cords in his arms 
came and went as he moved 
them. Once more I felt the parti- 
cular, special element of the Dor- 
sai in him. It was not just his 
physical size and strength. It 
was not even the fact that he 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



31 



was someone trained from birth 
to war, someone bred for battle. 
No, it was something living but 
untouchable — the same quality 
of difference to be found in the 
pure Exotic like Padma the Out- 
Bond, or in some Newtonian or 
Cassidan researchist. Something 
so much above and beyond the 
common form of man that it 
was like a serenity, a sense of 
conviction where his own type of 
thing was concerned that was so 
complete it made him beyond all 
weaknesses, untouchable, uncon- 
querable. 

I saw the slight, dark shadow 
of Jamethon Black in my mind’s 
eye, standing opposed to such a 
man as this; and the thought of 
any victory for Jamethon was 
unthinkable, an impossibility. 

But there was always danger. 

“All right, I’ll tell you what I 
came about,” I said to Kensie. 
“I’ve just found out Black’s been 
in touch with the Blue Front, a 
native terrorist political group 
with its headquarters in Blau- 
vain. Three of them visited him 
last night. I saw them.” 

Kensie picked up his shirt and 
slid a long arm into one sleeve. 

“I know,” he said. 

I stared at him. 

“Don’t you understand?” I 
said. “They’re assassins. It’s their 
stock in trade. And the one man 
they and Jamethon Black both 
could use out of the way is you.” 



He put his other arm in a 

sleeve. 

“I know that,” he said. “They 
want the present government 
here on St. Marie out of the way 
and themselves in power — which 
isn’t possible with Exotic money 
hiring us to keep the peace here.” 
“They haven’t had Jamethon 
Black’s help.” 

“Have they got it now?” he 
asked, sealing the shirt closure 
between thumb and forefinger. 

“The Friendlies are desperate,” 
I said. “Even if reinforcements 
arrived tomorrow, Jamethon 
knows what his chances are with 
you ready to move. Assassins 
may be outlawed by the Conven- 
tions of War and the Mercen- 
aries’ Code, but you and I know 
the Friendlies.” 

Kensie looked at me oddly 
and picked up his jacket. 

“Do we?” he said. 

I met his eyes. “Don’t we?” 
“Tam.” He put on the jacket 
and closed it. “I know the men 
I have to fight. It’s my business 
to know. But what makes you 
think you know them?” 

“They’re my business too,” I 
said. “Maybe you’d forgotten. 
I’m a newsman. People are my 
business, first, last and always.” 
“But you’ve got no use for the 
Friendlies.” 

“Should I?” I said. “I’ve been 
on all the worlds. I’ve seen the 
Cetan entrepreneur — and he 



32 



GALAXY 



wants his margin, but he’s a hu- 
man being. I’ve seen the New- 
tonian and the Cassidan with 
their heads in the clouds, but if 
you yanked on their sleeves hard 
enough, you could pull them 
back to reality. I’ve seen Exo- 
tics like Padma at their mental 
parlor tricks, and the Freilander 
up to his ears in his own red 
tape. I’ve seen them from my 
own world of Old Earth, and 
Coby, and Venus and even from 
the Dorsai, like you. And I tell 
you they’ve all got one thing in 
common. Underneath it all 
they’re human. Every one of 
them’s human — they’ve just 
specialized in some one, valuable 
way.” 

“And the Friendlies haven’t?” 

“Fascinaticism,” I said. “Is that 
valuable? It’s just the opposite. 
What’s good — what’s even per- 
missible about blind, deaf, dumb, 
unthinking faith that doesn’t let 
a man reason for himself?” 

“How do you know they don’t 
reason?” Kensie asked. He was 
standing facing me now. 

“Maybe some of them do,” I 
said. “Maybe the young ones, 
before the poison’s had time to 
work in. What good does that do, 
as long as the culture exists?” 

A sudden silence came into the 
-**- room. 

“What are you talking about?” 
said Kensie. 



“I mean you want the assas- 
sins,” I said. “You don’t want 
the Friendly troops. Prove that 
Jamethon Black has broken the 
Conventions of War by arranging 
with them to kill you; and you 
can win St. Marie for the Exotics 
without firing a shot.” 

“And how would I do that?” 
“Use me,” I said. “I’ve got a 
pipeline to the political group the 
assassins represent. Let me go to 
them as your representative and 
outbid Jamethon. You can offer 
them recognition by the present 
government, now. Padma and the 
present St. Marie government 
heads would have to back you 
up if you could clean the planet 
of Friendlies that easily.” 

He looked at me with no ex- 
pression at all. 

“And what would I be suppos- 
ed to buy with this?” he said. 

“Sworn testimony they’d been 
hired to assassinate you. As many 
of them as needed could testify.” 
“No Court of Interplanetary 
Inquiry would believe people 
like that,” Kensie said. 

“Ah,” I said, and I could not 
help smiling. “But they’d believe 
me as a News Network Repre- 
sentative when I backed up 
every word that was said.” 
There was a new silence. His 
face had no expression at all. 
“I see,” he said. 

He walked past me into the 
salon. I followed him. He went 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



33 



to his phone, put his finger on 
a stud and spoke into an image- 
less, gray screen. 

“Janol,” he said. 

He turned away from the 
screen, crossed the room to an 
arms cabinet and began putting 
cm. his battle harness. He moved 
deliberately and neither looked 
nor spoke in my direction. After 
a few long minutes, the building 
entrance slid aside and Janol 
stepped in. 

“Sir?” said the Freilander of- 
ficer. 

“Mr. Olyn stays here until fur- 
ther orders.” 

“Yes sir,” said Janol. 

Graeme went out. 

I stood numb, staring at the 
entrance through which he had 
left. I could not believe that he 
would violate the Conventions so 
far himself as not only to dis- 
regard me, but to put me essen- 
tially under arrest to keep me 
from doing anything further 
about the situation. 

I turned to Janol. He was 
looking at me with a sort of wry 
sympathy on his long, brown 
face. 

“Is the OutBond here in 
camp?” I asked him. 

“No.” He came up to me. “He’s 
back in the Exotic Embassy in 
Blauvain. Be a good fella now 
and sit down, why don’t you? 
We might as well kill the next 
few hours pleasantly.” 



We were standing face to face; 
I hit him in the stomach. 

I had done a little boxing as 
an undergraduate on the college 
level. I mention this not to make 
myself out a sort of muscular 
hero, but to explain why I had 
sense enough not to try for his 
jaw. Graeme could probably 
have found the knockout point 
there without even thinking, but 
I was no Dorsai. The area below 
a man’s breastbone is relatively 
large, soft, handy and generally 
just fine for amateurs. And I 
did know something about how 
to punch. 

For all that, Janol was not 
knocked out. He went over on 
the floor and lay there doubled 
up with his eyes still open. But 
he was not ready to get up right 
away. I turned and went quickly 
out of the building. 

The camp was busy. Nobody 
stopped me. I got back into my 
car, and five minutes later I was 
free on the darkening road for 
Blauvain. 

V 

TT'rom New San Marcos to 
Blauvain and Padma’s Em- 
bassy was fourteen hundred kilo- 
meters. I should have made it 
in six hours, but a bridge was 
washed out and I took fourteen. 

It was after eight the following 
morning when I burst into the 



34 



GALAXY 



half-park, half-building that was 
the embassy. 

“Padma — ” I said. “Is he 
still — ” 

“Yes, Mr. Olyn,” said the girl 
receptionist. “He’s expecting 
you.” 

She smiled above her purple 
robe. I did not mind. I was too 
busy being glad Padma had not 
already taken off for the fringe 
areas of the conflict. 

She took me down and around 
a corner and turned me over to 
a young male Exotic, who intro- 
duced himself as one of Padma’s 
secretaries. He took me a short 
distance and introduced me to 
another secretary, a middle-aged 
man this time, who led me 
through several rooms and then 
directed me down a long corri- 
dor and around a corner, beyond 
which he said was the entrance 
to the office area where Padma 
worked at the moment. Then he 
left me. 

I followed his direction. But 
when I stepped through that 
entrance it was not into a room, 
but into a further short corridor. 
And I checked, stopping myself 
dead. For what I suddenly 
thought I saw coming at me was 
Kensie Graeme — Kensie with 
murder on his mind. 

But the man who looked like 
Kensie n^erely glanced at me and 
dismissed me, continuing to come 
on. Then I knew. 



Of course, he was not Kensie. 
He was Kensie’s twin brother, 
Ian, commander of Garrison 
Forces for the Exotics, here in 
Blauvain. He strode on toward 
me; and I began once more to 
walk toward him, but the shock 
stayed with me until we had 
passed one another. 

I do not think anyone could 
have come on him like that, in 
my position and not been hit 
the same way. From Janol, at 
different times, I had gathered 
how Ian was the converse of 
Kensie. Not in a military sense 
— they were both magnificent 
specimens of Dorsai officers — 
but in the matter of their indi- 
vidual natures. 

Kensie had had a profound 
effect on me from the first mo- 
ment, with his cheerful nature 
and the warmth of being that 
at times obscured the very fact 
that he was a Dorsai. When the 
pressure of military affairs was 
not directly on him he seemed 
all sunshine; you could warm 
yourself in his presence as you 
might in the sun. Ian, his physi- 
cal duplicate, striding toward me 
like some two-eyed Odin, was all 
shadow. 

Here at last was the Dorsai 
legend come to life. Here was the 
grim man with the iron heart and 
the dark and solitary soul. In the 
powerful fortress of his body, 
what was essentially Ian dwelt as 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



35 



isolated as a hermit on a moun- 
tain. He was the fierce and 
lonely Highlandman of his dis- 
tant ancestry, come to life again. 

Not law, not ethics, but the 
trust of the given word, clan- 
loyalty and the duty of the blood 
feud held sway in Ian. He was 
a man who would cross hell to 
pay a debt for good or ill; and 
in that moment when I saw him 
coming toward me and recogniz- 
ed him at last, I suddenly thank- 
ed whatever gods were left, that 
he had no debt with me. 

r T''hen we had passed each oth- 
■*- er, and he was gone around 
a corner. 

Rumor had it, I remembered 
then, that the blackness around 
him never lightened except in 
Kensie’s presence. That he was 
truly his twin brother’s other 
half. And that if he should ever 
lost the light that Kensie’s bright 
presence shed on him, he would 
be doomed to his own lightless- 
ness forever. 

It was a statement I was to 
remember at a later time, as 
I was to remember seeing him 
come toward me in that moment. 

But now I forgot him as I went 
forward through another entrance 
into what looked like a small 
conservatory and saw the gentle 
face and short-cropped white 
hair of Padma, the OutBond, 
wearing a pale yellow robe. 



“Come in, Mr. Olyn,” he said, 
getting up. “And come along with

me. 

He turned and walked out 
through an archway of purple 
clematis blooms. I followed him, 
and found a small courtyard, all 
but filled with the elliptical 
shape of a sedan aircar. Padma 
was already climbing into one 
of the seats facing the controls. 
He held the door for me. 

“Where are we going?” I asked 
as I got in. 

He touched the autopilot pan- 
el; the ship rose in the air. He 
left it to its own navigation, and 
pivoted his chair about to face 
me. 

“To Commander Graeme’s 
headquarters in the field,” he an- 
swered. 

His eyes were a light hazel 
color, but they seemed to catch 
and swim with the sunlight strik- 
ing through the transparent top 
of the aircar, as we reached alti- 
tude and began to move horizon- 
tally. I could not read them, or 
the expression on his face. 

“I see,” I said. “Of course, I 
know a call from Graeme’s HQ 
could get to you much faster 
than I could by groundcar from 
the same spot. But I hope you 
aren’t thinking of having him 
kidnap me or something like 
that. I have Credentials of Im- 
partiality protecting me as a 
Newsman, as well as authoriza-

tions from both the Friendly and 
the Exotic worlds. And I don’t 
intend to be held responsible for 
any conclusions drawn by Grae- 
me after the conversation the 
two of us had earlier this morn- 
ing — alone." 

Padma sat still in his aircar 
seat, facing me. His hands were 
folded in his lap together, pale 
against the yellow robe, but 
with strong sinews showing under 
the skin of their backs. 

“You’re coming with me now 
by my decision, not Kensie 
Graeme’s.” 

“I want to know why,” I said 

tensely. 

“Because,” he said slowly, 
“you are very dangerous.” And 
he sat still, looking at me with 
unwavering eyes. 

I waited for him to go on, 
but he did not. “Dangerous?” I 
said. “Dangerous to who?” 

“To the future of all of us.” 

I stared at him, then I laugh- 
ed. I was angry. 

“Cut it out!” I said. 

He shook his head slowly, his 
eyes never leaving my face. I 
was baffled by those eyes. In- 
nocent and open as a child’s, but 
I could not see through them 
into the man himself. 

“All right,” I said. “Tell me, 
why am I dangerous?” 

“Because you want to destroy 
a race of people. And you know 
how.” 



nphere was a short silence. The 
aircar fled on through the 
skies without a sound. 

“Now that’s an odd notion,” 
I said slowly and calmly. “I 
wonder where you got it?” 
“From our ontogenic calcula- 
tions,” said Padma, as calmly as 
I had spoken. “And it’s not a 
notion, Tam. As you know your- 
self.” 

“Oh, yes,” I said. “Ontogenies. 
I was going to look that up.” 
“You did look it up, didn’t 
you, Tam?” 

“Did I?” I said. “I guess I did, 
at that. It didn’t seem very clear 
to me, though, as I remember. 
Something about evolution.” 
“Ontogenies,” said Padma, “is 
the study of the effect of evolu- 
tion upon the interacting forces 
of human society.” 

“Am I an interacting force?” 
“At the moment and for the 
past several years, yes,” said 
Padma. “And possibly for some 
years into the future. But possib- 
ly not.” 

“That sounds almost like a 
threat.” 

“In a sense it is.” Padma’s 
eyes caught the light as I watch- 
ed them. “You’re capable of de- 
stroying yourself as well as oth- 
ers.” 

“I’d hate to do that.” 

“Then,” said Padma, “you’d 
better listen to me.” 

“Why, of course,” I said. 

37 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



“That’s my business, listening. 
Tell me all about ontogenies — 
and myself.” 

He made an adjustment in the 
controls, then swung his seat 
back to face mine once more. 

“The human race,” said Pad- 
ma, “broke up in an evolutionary 
explosion at the moment in his- 
tory when interstellar coloniza- 
tion became practical.” He sat 
watching me. I kept my face 
attentive. “This happened for 
reasons stemming from racial in- 
stinct which we haven’t com- 
pletely charted yet, but which 
was essentially self-protective in 
nature.” 

I reached into my jacket pock- 
et. 

“Perhaps I’d better take a few 
notes,” I said. 

“If you want to,” said Padma, 
unperturbed. “Out of that explo- 
sion came cultures individually 
devoted to single facets of the 
human personality. The fighting, 
combative facet became the Dor- 
sai. The facet which surrendered 
the individual wholly to some 
faith or other became the Friend- 
ly. The philosophical facet creat- 
ed the Exotic culture to which 
I belong. We call these Splinter 
Cultures.” 

“Oh, yes,” I said. “I know 
about Splinter Cultures.” 

“You know about them, Tam, 
but you don’t know them.” 

“I don’t?” 



“No,” said Padma, “because 
you, like all our ancestors, are 
from Earth. You’re old, full- 
spectrum man. The Splinter peo- 
ples are evolutionarily advanced 
over you.” 

I felt a little twist of bitter 
anger knot suddenly inside me. 

“Oh? I’m afraid I don’t see 
that.” 

“Because you don’t want to,” 
said Padma. “If you did, you’d 
have to admit that they were 
different from you, and had to 
be judged by different stand- 
ards.” 

“Different? How?” 

“Different in a sense that all 
Splinter people, including my- 
self, understand instinctively, but 
full-spectrum man has to extra- 
polate to imagine.” Padma shift- 
ed a little in his seat. “You’ll get 
some idea, Tam, if you imagine 
a member of a Splinter culture 
to be a man like yourself, only 
with a monomania that shoves 
him wholly toward being one 
type of person. But with this 
difference: Instead of all parts 
of his mental and physical self 
outside the limits of that mono- 
mania being ignored and atrophi- 
ed as, they would be with 
you — ” 

1 interrupted, “Why specifical- 
ly with me?” 

“With any full-spectrum man, 
then,” said Padma calmly. 



38 



GALAXY 



“These parts, instead of being 
atrophied, are altered to agree 
with and support the monoma- 
nia, so that we don’t have a sick 
man — but a healthy, different 
one.” 

“Healthy?” I said, seeing the 
Friendly non-com on New Earth 
again in my mind’s eye. 

“Healthy as a culture. Not as 
occasional crippled individuals 
of that culture. But as a culture.” 
“Sorry,” I said. “I don’t believe 
it.” 

“But you do, Tam,” said Pad- 
ma, softly. “Unconsciously you 
do. Because you’re planning to 
take advantage of the weakness 
such a culture must have to de- 
stroy it.” 

“And what weakness is that?” 
“The obvious weakness that's 
the converse of any strength,” 
said Padma. “The Splinter Cul- 
tures are not viable.” 

I must have blinked. I was 
honestly bewildered. 

“Not viable? You mean they 
can’t live on their own?” 

“Of course not,” said Padma. 
“Faced with an expansion into 
space, the human race reacted to 
the challenge of a different en- 
vironment by trying to adapt to 
it. It adapted by trying out se- 
parately all the elements of its 
personality, to see which could 
survive best. Now that all ele- 
ments — the Splinter Cultures — 
have survived and adapted, it's 



time for them to breed back into 
each other again, to produce a 
more hardy, universe- oriented 
human.” 

The aircar began to descend. 
We were nearing our destination. 

“What’s that got to do with 
me?” I said, at last. 

“If you frustrate one of the 
Splinter Cultures, it can’t adapt 
on its own as full-spectrum man 
would do. It will die. And when 
the race breeds back to a whole, 
that valuable element will be 
lost to the race.” 

“Maybe it’ll be no loss,” I said, 
softly in my turn. 

“A vital loss,” said Padma. 
“And I can prove it. You, a full- 
spectrum man, have in you an 
element from every Splinter Cul- 
ture. If you admit this you can 
identify even with those you 
want to destroy. I have evidence 
to show you. Will you look at 
it?” 

The ship touched ground; the 
door beside me opened. I got out 
with Padma and found Kensie 
waiting. 

I looked from Padma to Ken- 
sie, who stood with us and a 
head taller than I — two heads 
taller than OutBond. Kensie 
looked back down at me with no 
particular expression. His eyes 
were not the eyes of his twin 
brother — but just then, for 
some reason, I could not meet 
them. 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



39 



“I’m a newsman,” I said. “Of 
course my mind is open.” [ 

Padma turned and began'- 
walking toward the headquart - 1 
ers building. Kensie fell in with 
us and I think Janol and some 
of the others came along be- 
hind, though I didn’t look back 
to make sure. We went to the 
inner office where I first met 
Graeme — just Kensie, Padma 
and myself. There was a file 
folder on Graeme’s desk. He 
picked it up, extracted a photo- 
copy of something and handed 
it to me as I came up to him. 

I took it. There was no doubt- 
ing its authenticity. 

Tt was a memo from Eldest 
-*■ Bright, ranking elder of the 
joint government of Harmony 
and Association, to the Friendly 
War Chief at the Defense X Cen- 
ter, on Harmony. It was dated 
two months previously. It was 
on the single-molecule sheet, 
where the legend cannot be tam- 
pered with, or removed once it 
is on. 

Be Informed, in God's Name — 

—That since it does seem the Lord's 
Will that our Brothers on St. Marie 
make no success, it is ordered that 
henceforth no more replacements or 
personnel or supplies be sent them. For 
if our Captain does intend us the vic- 
tory, surely we shall conquer without 
further expenditure. And if it be His wiH 
that we conquer not, then surely it 
would be an impiety to throw away the 

40 



substance of God's Churches in an at- 
tempt to frustrate that WiH. 

Be it further ordered that our Bro- 
thers on St. Marie be spared the knowl- 
edge that no further assistance is 
forthcoming, that they may bear wit- 
ness to their faith in battle as ever, 
and God's Churches be undismayed. 

Heed this Command, in the Name of 
the Lord: 

By order of he who is called . • 
Bright 

Eldest Among The Chosen 

I looked up from the memo. 
Both Graeme and Padma were 
watching me. 

“How’d you get hold of this?” 
I said. “No, of course you won’t 
tell me.” The palms of my hands 
were suddenly sweating so that 
the slick material of the sheet 
in my fingers was slippery. I 
held it tightly, and talked fast to 
keep their eyes on my face. “But 
what about it? We already knew 
this, everybody knew Bright had 
abandoned them. This just 
proves it. Why even bother 
showing it to me?” 

“I thought,” said Padma, “it 
might move you just a little. 
Perhaps enough to make you 
take a different view of things.” 
I said, “I didn’t say that wasn’t 
possible. I tell you a Newsman 
keeps an open mind at all times. 
Of course,” I picked my words 
carefully, “if I could study it — ” 
“I’d hoped you’d take it with 
you,” said Padma. 

“Hoped?” 

“If you dig into it and really 
GALAXY 



understand what Bright means 
there, you might understand all 
the Friendlies differently. You 
might change your mind about 
them.” 

“I don’t think so,” I said. 
“But — ” 

“Let me ask you to do that 
much,” said Padma. “Take the 
memo with you.” 

I stood for a moment, with 
Padma facing me and Kensie 
looming behind him, then shrug- 
ged and put the memo in my 
pocket. 

“All right,” I said. I’ll take it 
back to my quarters and think 
about it. — I’ve got a groundcar 
here somewhere, haven’t I?” And 
I looked at Kensie. 

“Ten kilometers back,” said 
Kensie. “You wouldn’t get 
through anyway. We’re moving 
up for the assault and the 
Friendlies are maneuvering to 
meet us.” 

“Take my aircar,” said Padma. 
“The Embassy flags on it will 
help.” 

“All right,” I said. 

We went out together toward 
the aircar. I passed Janol in the 
outer office and he met my eyes 
coldly. I did not blame him. We 
walked to the aircar and I got 
in. 

“You can send the aircar back 
whenever you’re through with 
it,” said Padma, as I stepped 
in through the entrance section 



of its top. “It’s an Embassy loan 
to you, T am. I won’t worry about 
it.” 

“No,” I said. “You needn’t 
worry.” 

I closed the section and touch- 
ed the controls. 

It was a dream of an aircar. 
It went up into the air as lightly 
as thought, and in a second I 
was two thousand feet up and 
well away from the spot. I made 
myself calm down, though, be- 
fore I reached into my pocket 
and took the memo out. 

I looked at it. My hand still 
trembled a little as I held it. 

Here it was in my grasp at 
last. What I had been after from 
the start. And Padma himself 
had insisted I carry it away with 
me. 

It was the lever, the Archi- 
medes pry-bar which would move 
not one world but fourteen. And 
push the Friendly Peoples over 
the edge to extinction. 

VI 

r T''hey were waiting for me. 

They converged on the air- 
car as I landed it in the interior 
square of the Friendlies com- 
pound, all four of them with 
black rifles at the ready. 

They were apparently the only 
ones left. Black seemed to have 
turned out every other man of 
his remnant of a battle unit. And 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



41 



these were all men I recognized, 
case-hardened veterans. One was 
the Groupman who had been in 
the office that first night when 
I had come back from the Exo- 
tic camp and stepped in to speak 
to Black, asking him if he ever 
ordered his men to kill prison- 
ers. Another was a forty-year 
old Force Leader, the lowest 
commissioned rank, but acting 
Major — just as Black, a Com- 
mandant, was acting as Expedi- 
tionary Field Commander — a 
position equivalent to Kensie 
Graeme’s. The other two soldiers 
were non-commissioned, but si- 
milar. I knew them all. Ultra- 
fanatics. And they knew me. 

We understood each other. 

“I have to see the command- 
ant,” I said, as I got out, before 
they could begin to question me. 

“On what business?” said the 
Force-Leader. “This aircar hath 
no business here. Nor thyself.” 

I said, “I must see Comman- 
dant Black immediately. I 
wouldn’t be here in a car flying 
the flags of the Exotic Embassy 
if its wasn’t necessary.” 

They could not take the chance 
that my reason for seeing Black 
wasn’t important, and I knew it. 
They argued a little, but I kept 
insisting I had to see the Com- 
mandant. Finally, the Force- 
Leader took me across into the 
same outer office where I had 
always waited to see Black. 

42 



I faced Jamethon Black alone 
in the office. 

He was putting on his battle 
harness, as I had seen Graeme 
putting on his earlier. On Grae- 
me, the harness and the weapons 
it carried had looked like toys. 
On Jamethon’s slight frame they 
looked almost too heavy to bear. 

“Mr. Olyn,” he said. 

I walked across the room to- 
ward him, drawing the memo 
from my pocket as I came. He 
turned a little to face me, his 
fingers sealing the locks on his 
harness, jingling slightly with his 
weapons and his harness as he 
turned. 

“You’re taking the field against 
the Exotics,” I said. 

He nodded. I had never been 
this close to him before. From 
across the room I would have 
believed he was holding his 
usual stony expression, but 
standing just a few feet from 
him now I saw the tired wraith 
of a smile touch the corners of 
his straight mouth in that dark, 
young face, for a second. 

“That is my duty, Mr. Olyn.” 

“Some duty,” I said. “When 
your superiors back on Harmony 
have already written you off 
their books.” 

“I’ve already told you,” he 
said, calmly. “The Chosen are 
not betrayed in the Lord, one 
by another.” 

“You’re sure of that?” I said. 

GALAXY 



Once more I saw that little 
ghost of a weary smile. 

“It’s a subject, Mr. Olyn, on 
which I am more expert than 
you.” 

T looked into his eyes. They 
were exhausted but calm. I 
glanced aside at the desk where 
the picture of the church, the 
older man and woman and the 
young girl stood still. 

“Your family?” I asked. 

“Yes,” he said. 

“It seems to me you’d think 
of them in a time like this.” 

“I think of them quite often.” 

“But you’re going to go out 
and get yourself killed just the 
same.” 

“Just the same,” he said. 

“Sure!” I said. “You would!” 
I had come in calm and in con- 
trol of myself. But now it was as 
if a cork had been pulled on all 
that had been inside me since 
Dave’s death. I began to shake. 
“Because that’s the kind of hy- 
pocrites you are — all of you 
Friendlies. You’re so lying, so 
rotten clear through with your 
own lies, if someone took them 
away from you there’d be noth- 
ing left. Would there? So you’d 
rather die now than admit com- 
mitting suicide like this isn’t the 
most glorious thing in the uni- 
verse. You’d rather die than ad- 
mit you’re just as full of doubts 
as anyone else, just as afraid.” 



I stepped right up to him. He 
did not move. 

“Who’re you trying to fool?” 
I said. “Who? I see through you 
just like the people on all the 
other worlds do! I know you 
know what a mumbo-jumbo your 
United Churches are. I know you 
know the way of life you sing of 
through your nose so much isn’t 
what you claim it is. I know your 
Eldest Bright and his gang of 
narrow-minded old men are just 
a gang of world-hungry tyrants 
that don’t give a damn for reli- 
gion or anything as long as they 
get what they want. I know you 
know it — and I’m going to make 
you admit it!” 

And I shoved the memo under 
his nose. 

“Read it!” 

He took it from me. I stepped 
back from him, shaking badly 
as I watched him. 

He studied it for a long minute, 
while I held my breath. His face 
did not change. Then he handed 
it back to me. 

“Can I give you a ride to meet 
Graeme?” I said. “We can get 
across the lines in the OutBond’s 
aircar. You can get the surrend- 
er over with before any shooting 
breaks out.” 

He shook his head. He was 
looking at me in a particularly 
level way, with an expression I 
could not understand. 

“What do you mean — no?” 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



43 



“You’d better stay here,” he 
said. “Even with ambassadorial 
flags, that aircar may be shot at 
over the lines.” And he turned as 
if he would walk away from me, 
out the door. 

“Where’re you going?” I 
shouted at him. I got in front of 
him and pushed the memo before 
his eyes again. “That’s real. You 
can’t close your eyes to that!” 

Ti e stopped and looked at me. 
^ Then he reached out and 
took my wrist and put my arm 
and hand with the memo aside. 
His fingers were thin, but much 
stronger than I thought, so that 
I let the arm go down in front 
of him when I hadn’t intended to 
do so. 

“I know it’s real. I’ll have to 
warn you not to interfere with 
me any more, Mr. Olyn. I’ve got 
to go now.” He stepped past me 
and walked toward the door. 

“You’re a liar!” I shouted after 
him. He kept on going. I had to 
stop him. I grabbed the solido- 
graph from his desk and smashed 
it on the floor. 

He turned like a cat and look- 
ed at the broken pieces at my 
feet. 

“That’s what you’re doing!” I 
shouted, pointing at them. 

He came back without a word 
and squatted down and carefully 
gathered up the pieces, one by 
one. He put them into his pocket 



and got back to his feet, and 
raised his face at last to mine. 
And when I saw his eyes I stop- 
ped breathing. 

“If my duty,” he said, in a low, 
controlled voice, “were not in this 
minute to — ” 

His voice stopped. I saw his 
eyes staring into me; and slowly 
I saw them change and the mur- 
der that was in them soften into 
something like wonder. 

“Thou — ” he said, softly — 
“Thou hast no faith?” 

I had opened my mouth to 
speak. But what he said stopped 
me. I stood as if punched in the 
stomach, without the breath for 
words. He stared at me. 

“What made you think,” he 
said, “that that memo would 
change my mind?” 

“You read it!” I said. “Bright 
wrote you were a losing propo- 
sition here, so you weren’t to get 
any more help. And no one was 
to tell you for fear you might 
surrender if you knew.” 

“Is that how you read it?” 
he said. “Like that?” 

“How else? How else can you 
read it?” 

“As it is written.” He stood 
straight facing me now and his 
eyes never moved from mine. 
“You have read it without faith, 
leaving out the Name and the 
will of the Lord. Eldest Bright 
wrote not that we were to be 
abandoned here — but that since 



44 



GALAXY 



our cause was sore tried, we be 
put in the hands of our Captain 
and our God. And further he 
wrote that we should not be told 
of this, that none here should be 
tempted to a vain and special 
seeking of the martyr’s crown. 
Look, Mr. Olyn. It’s down there 
in black and white.” 

“But that’s not what he meant! 
That’s not what he meant!” 

He shook his head. “Mr. Olyn, 
I can’t leave you in such de- 
lusion.” 

I stared at him, for it was sym- 
pathy I saw in his face. For me. 

“It’s your own blindness that 
deludes you,” he said. “You see 
nothing, and so believe no man 
can see. Our Lord is not just a 
name, but all things. That’s why 
we have no ornament in our 
churches, scorning any painted 
screen between us and our God. 
Listen to me, Mr. Olyn. Those 
churches themselves are but ta- 
bernacles of the earth. Our Eld- 
ers and Leaders, though they 
are Chosen and Anointed, are 
still but mortal men. To none of 
these things or people do we 
hearken in our faith, but to the 
very voice of God within us.” 

TTe paused. Somehow I could 
not speak. 

“Suppose it was even as you 
think,” he went on, even more 
gently. “Suppose that all you 
say was a fact; and that our Eld- 



ers were but greedy tyrants, our- 
selves abandoned here by their 
selfish will and set to fulfill a 
false and prideful purpose. No.” 
Jamethon’s voice rose. “Let me 
attest as if it were only for my- 
self. Suppose that you could give 
me proof that all our Elders lied, 
that our very Covenant was 
false. Suppose that you could 
prove to me — ” his face lifted 
to mine and his voice drove at 
me — “that all was perversion 
and falsehood, and nowhere 
among the Chosen, not even in 
the house of my father, was there 
faith or hope! If you could prove 
to me that no miracle could save 
me, that no soul stood with me — 
and that opposed were all the 
legions of the universe — still I, 
I alone, Mr. Olyn, would go for- 
ward as I have been command- 
ed, to the end of the universe, to 
the culmination of eternity. For 
without my faith I am but com- 
mon earth. But with my faith, 
there is r.o power can stay me!” 

He stopped speaking and turn- 
ed about. I watched him walk 
across the room and out the 
door. 

Still I stood there, as if I had 
been fastened in place — until I 
heard from outside, in the square 
of the compound, the sound of 
a military aircar starting up. 

I broke out of my stasis then 
and ran out of the building. 

As I burst into the square, the 

45 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



military aircar was just taking 
off. I could see Black and his 
four hard-shell subordinates in 
it. And I yelled up into the air 
after them. 

“That’s all right for you, but 
what about your men?” 

They could not hear me. I 
knew that. Uncontrollable tears 
were running down my face, but 
I screamed up into the air after 
him anyway — 

“You’re killing your men to 
prove your point! Can’t you lis- 
ten? You’re murdering helpless 
men!” 

Unheeding, the military aircar 
dwindled rapidly to the west and 
south, where the converging bat- 
tle forces waited. And the heavy 
concrete walls and buildings 
about the empty compound 
threw back my words with a 
hollow, wild and mocking echo. 

VII 

T should have gone to the space- 
port. Instead, I got back into 
the aircar and flew back across 
the lines looking for Graeme’s 
Battle Command Center. 

I was as little concerned about 
my own life just then as a 
Friendly. I think I was shot at 
once or twice, in spite of the am- 
bassadorial flags on the aircar, 
but I don’t remember exactly. 
Eventually I found the Com- 
mand Center and descended. 



Enlisted men surrounded m« 
as I stepped out of the aircar. 
I showed my credentials and 
went up to the battle screen, 
which had been set up in open 
air at the edge of shadow from 
some tall variform oaks. Grae- 
me, Padma and his whole staff 
were grouped around it, watch- 
ing the movements of their own 
and the Friendly troops reported 
on it. A continual low-voiced dis- 
cussion of the movements went 
on, and a steady stream of infor- 
mation came from the commu- 
nications center fifteen feet off. 

The sun slanted steeply 
through the trees. It was almost 
noon and the day was bright and 
warm. No one looked at me for 
a long time; and then Janol, 
turning away from the screen, 
caught sight of me standing off 
at one side by the flat-topped 
shape of a tactics computer. His 
face went cold. He went on about 
what he was doing. But I must 
have been looking pretty bad, 
because after a while he came by 
with a canteen cup and set it 
down on the computer top. 

“Drink that,” he said shortly, 
and went off. I picked it up, 
found it was Dorsai whisky and 
swallowed it down. I could not 
taste it; but evidently it did me 
some good, because in a few 
minutes the world began to sort 
itself out around me and I began 
to think again.

I went up to Janol. “Thanks.” 
“All right.” He did not look at 
me, but went on with the papers 
on the field desk before him. 

“Janol,” X said. “Tell me 
what’s going on.” 

“See for yourself,” he said, still 
bent over his papers. 

“I can’t see for myself. You 
know that. Look — I’m sorry 
about what I did. But this is my 
job, too. Can’t you tell me what’s 
going on now and fight with me 
afterwards?” 

“You know I can’t brawl with 
civilians.” Then his face relaxed. 
“All right,” he said, straightening 
up. “Come on.” 

T_T e led me over to the battle 
-*■ screen, where Padma and 
Kensie were standing, and point- 
ed to a sort of small triangle of 
darkness between two snakelike 
lines of light. Other spots and 
shapes of light ringed it about. 

“These — ” he pointed to the 
two snakelike lines — “are the 
Macintok and Sarah Rivers, 
where they come together — just 
about ten miles this side of Jo- 
seph’s Town. It’s fairly high 
ground, hills thick with cover, 
fairly open between them. Good 
territory for setting up a stub- 
born defense, bad area to get 
trapped in.” 

“Why?” 

He pointed to the two river 
lines. 



“Get backed up in here and 
you find yourself hung up on 
high bluffs over the river. There 
is no easy way across, no cover 
for retreating troops. It’s nearly 
all open farmland the rest of the 
way, from the other sides of the 
rivers to Joseph’s Town.” 

His finger moved back out 
from the point where the river 
lines came together, past the 
small area of darkness and into 
the surrounding shapes and rings 
of light. 

“On the other hand, the ap- 
proach to this territory from our 
position is through open country, 
too — narrow strips of farmland 
interspersed with a lot of swamp 
and marsh. It’s a tight situation 
for either commander, if we com- 
mit to a battle here. The first 
one who has to backpedal will 
find himself in trouble in a 
hurry.” 

“Are you going to commit?” 

“It depends. Black sent his 
light armor forward. Now he’s 
pulling back into the high 
ground, between the rivers. 
We’re far superior in strength 
and equipment. There’s no rea- 
son for us not to go in after him, 
as long as he’s trapped himself 
— ” Janol broke off. 

“No reason?” I asked. 

“Not from a tactical stand- 
point.” Janol frowned at the 
screen. “We couldn’t get into 
trouble unless we suddenly had 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



47 



to retreat. And we wouldn’t 
do that unless he suddenly ac- 
quired some great tactical ad- 
vantage that’d make it impos- 
sible for us to stay there.” 

I looked at his profile. 

“Such as losing Graeme?” I 
said. 

He transferred his frown to 
me. “There’s no danger of that.” 

^TT'here was a certain change in 
the movement and the 
voices of the people around us. 
We both turned and looked. 

Everybody was clustering 
around a screen. We moved 
in with the crowd and, looking 
between the soldiers of two of 
the officers of Graeme’s staff, 
I saw on the screen the image 
of a small grassy meadow en- 
closed by wooded hills. In the 
center of the meadow, the 
Friendly flag floated its thin 
black cross on white back- 
ground beside a long table on 
the grass. There were folding 
chairs on each side of the table, 
but only one person — a Friend- 
ly officer, standing on the 
table’s far side as if waiting. 
There were the lilac bushes 
along the edge of the wooded 
hills where they came down in 
variform oak and ash to the 
meadow’s edge; and the laven- 
der blossoms were beginning to 
brown and darken for their sea- 
son was almost at an end. So 



much difference had twenty- 
four hours made. Off to the 
left of the screen I could see 
the gray concrete of a highway. 

“I know that place — ” I start- 
ed to say, turning to Janol. 

“Quiet!” he said, holding up 
a finger. Around us, everybody 
else had fallen still. Up near 
the front of our group a single 
voice was talking. 

“ — it’s a truce table.” 

“Have they called?” said the 
voice of Kensie. 

“No, sir.” 

“Well, let’s go see.” There 
was a stir up front. The group 
began to break up and I saw 
Kensie and Padma walking off 
toward the area where the air- 
cars were parked. I shoved my- 
self through the thinning crowd 
like a process server, running 
after them. 

I heard Janol shout behind 
me, but I paid no attention. 
Then I was up to Kensie and 
Padma, who turned. 

“I want to go with you,” I 
said. 

“It’s all right, Janol,” Ken- 
sie said, looking past me. “You 
can leave him with us.” 

“Yes, sir.” I could hear 
Janol turn and leave. 

“So you want to come with 
me, Mr. Olyn?” Kensie said. 

“I know that spot,” I told 
him. “I drove by it just earlier 
today. The Friendlies were 



48 



GALAXY 



taking tactical measurements 
all over that meadow and the 
hills on both sides. They 
weren’t setting up truce talks.” 

T7" ensie looked at me for a 
long moment, as if he was 
taking some tactical measure- 
ments himself. 

“Come on, then,” he said. He 
turned to Padma. “You’ll be 
staying here?” 

“It’s a combat zone. I’d bet- 
ter not.” Padma turned his un- 
wrinkled face to me. “Good 
luck, Mr. Olyn,” he said, and 
walked away. I watched his yel- 
low-robed figure glide over the 
turf for a second, then turned 
to see Graeme halfway to the 
nearest military aircar. I hur- 
ried after him. 

It was a battle car, not lux- 
urious like the OutBond’s, and 
Kensie did not cruise at two 
thousand feet, but snaked it be- 
tween the trees just a few feet 
above ground. The seats were 
cramped. His big frame over- 
filled his, crowding me where 
I sat. I felt the butt-plate of his 
spring pistol grinding into my 
side with every movement he 
made on the controls. 

We came at last to the edge 
of the wooded and hilly triangle 
occupied by the Friendlies and 
mounted a slope under the cov- 
er of the new-leaved variform 
oaks. 




SOLDIER, ASK NOT

They were massive enough 
to have killed off most ground 
cover. Between their pillar-like 
trunks the ground was shaded, 
and padded with the brown 
shapes of dead leaves. Near the 
crest of the hill, we came upon 
a unit of Exotic troops resting 
and waiting the orders to ad- 
vance. Kensie got out of the 
car and returned the Force- 
Leader’s salute. 

“You’ve seen these tables the 
Friendlies set up?” Kensie 
asked. 

“Yes, Commander. That of- 
ficer they’ve got is still stand- 
ing there. If you go just up 
over the crest of the slope here, 
you can see him — and the fur- 
niture.” 

“Good,” said Kensie. “Keep 
your men here, Force. The 
Newsman and I’ll go take a 
look.” 

He led the way up among the 
oak trees. At the top of the hill 
we looked down through about 
fifty yards more of trees and 
out into the meadow. It was two 
hundred yards across, the table 
right in the middle, the unmov- 
ing black figure of the Friendly 
officer standing on its far side. 

“What do you think of it, Mr. 
Olyn?” asked Kensie, looking 
down through the trees. 

“Why hasn’t somebody shot 
him?” I asked. 

He glanced sideways at me. 



“There’s plenty of time to 
shoot him,” he said, “before he 
can get back to cover on the far 
side. If we have to shoot him 
at all. That wasn’t what I 
wanted to know. You’ve seen the 
Friendly commander recently. 
Did he give you the impression 
he was ready to surrender?” 

“No!” I said. 

“I see,” said Kensie. 

“You don’t really think he 
means to surrender? What 
makes you think something like 
that?” 

“Truce tables are generally 
set up for the discussion of 
terms between opposing forc- 
es,” he said. 

“But he hasn’t asked you to 
meet him?” 

“No,” Kensie watched the 
figure of the Friendly officer, 
motionless in the sunlight. “It 
might be against his principles 
to call for a discussion, but not 
to discuss — if we just happened 
to find ourselves across a table 
from one another.” 

He turned and signaled with 
his hand. The Force-Leader, 
who had been waiting down the 
slope behind us, came up. 

“Sir?” he said to Kensie. 

“Any Friendly strength in 
those trees across the way?” 

“Four men, that’s all, sir, 
Our scopes pick out their body 
heats clear and sharp. They 
aren’t attempting to hide.” 



50 



GALAXY 



“I see.” He paused, “Force.” 

“Sir?” 

“Be good enough to go down 
there in the meadow and ask 
that Friendly officer what this 
is all about.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

We stood and watched as the 
Force-Leader went stiff-legging 
it down the steep slope between 
the trees. He crossed the grass 
— it seemed very slowly — and 
came up to the Friendly officer. 

They stood facing each other. 
They were talking but there 
was no way to hear their voices. 
The flag with its thin black 
cross whipped in the little 
breeze that was blowing there. 
Then the Force-Leader turned 
and climbed back toward us. 

TTe stopped in front of Ken- 
-*• -*■ sie, and saluted. “Com- 
mander,” he said, “the Com- 
mander of the Chosen Troops 
of God will meet with you in 
the field to discuss a surrender.” 
He stopped to draw a fresh 
breath. “If you’ll show your- 
self at the edge of the opposite 
woods at the same time; and 
you can approach the table to- 
gether.” 

“Thank you, Force-Leader,” 
said Kensie. He looked past his 
officer at the field and the 
table. “I think I’ll go down.” 

“He doesn’t mean it,” I said. 

“Force-Leader,” said Kensie. 



"Form your men ready, just 
under the crown of the slope on 
the back side, here. If he sur- 
renders, I’m going to insist he 
come back with me to this side , 
immediately.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“All this business without a 
regular call for parley may be 
because he wants to surrender 
first and break the news of it to 
his troops afterwards. So get 
your men ready. If Black in- 
tends to present his officers 
with an accomplished fact, we 
don’t want to let him down.” 
“He’s not going to surren- 
der,” I said. 

“Mr. Olyn,” said Kensie, turn- 
ing to me. “I suggest you go 
back behind the crest of the 
hill. The Force-Leader will see 
you’re taken care of.” 

“No,” I said. “I’m going 
down. If it’s a truce parley to 
discuss surrender terms, there’s 
no combat situation involved 
and I’ve got a perfect right to 
be there. If it isn’t, what’re you 
doing going down yourself?” 
Kensie looked at me strange- 
ly for a moment. 

“All right,” he said. “Come 
with me.” 

Kensie and I turned and went 
down the sharply pitched slope 
between the trees. Our boot- 
soles slipped until our heels 
dug in, with every step down- 
ward. Coming through the 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



51 



lilacs I smelled the faint, sweet 
scent — almost gone now — of the 
decaying blossoms. 

Across the meadow, directly 
in line with the table, four fig- 
ures in black came forward as 
we came forward. One of them 
was Jamethon Black. 

Kensie and Jamethon saluted 
each other. 

“Commandant Black,” said 
Kensie. 

“Yes, Commander Graeme. 
I am indebted to you for meet- 
ing me here,” said Jamethon. 

“My duty and a pleasure, 
Commandant.” 

“I wished to discuss the terms 
of a surrender.” 

“I can offer you,” said Kensie, 
“the customary terms extended 
to troops in your position under 
the Mercenaries’ Code.” 

“You misunderstand me, sir,” 
said Jamethon. “It was your sur- 
render I came here to discuss.” 

he flag snapped. 

Suddenly I saw the men in 
black measuring the field here, 
as I had seen them the day be- 
fore. They had been right where 
we were now. 

“I’m afraid the misunderstand- 
ing is mutual, Commandant,” 
said Kensie. “I am in a superior 
tactical position and your defeat 
is normally certain. I have no 
need to surrender.” 

“You will not surrender?” 



“No,” said Kensie strongly. 

All at once I saw the five 
stakes, in the position the Friend- 
ly non-coms, officers and Jame- 
thon were now, and the stake up 
in front of them fallen down. 

“Look out!” I shouted at Ken- 
sie — but I was far too late. 

Things had already begun to 
happen. The Force-Leader had 
jerked back in front of Jamethon 
and all five of them were draw- 
ing their sidearms. I heard the 
flag snap again, and the sound 
of its rolling seemed to go on for 
a long time. 

For the first time then I saw a 
man of the Dorsai in action. So 
swift was Kensie’s reaction that 
it was eerily as if he had read 
Jamethon’s mind in the instant 
before the Friendlies began to 
reach of their weapons. As their 
hands touched their sidearms, he 
was already in movement for- 
ward over the table and his 
spring pistol was in his hand. He 
seemed to fly directly into the 
Force-Leader and the two of 
them went down together, but 
Kensie kept travelling. He rolled 
on off the Force-Leader who 
now lay still in the grass. He 
came to his knees, fired, and 
dived forward, rolling again. 

The Groupman on Jamethon’s 
right went down. Jamethon and 
the remaining two were turned 
nearly full about now, trying to 
keep Kensie before them. The 




52 



GALAXY 



two that were left shoved them- 
selves in front of Jamethon, their 
weapons not yet aimed. Kensie 
stopped moving as if he had run 
into a stone wall, came to his 
feet in a crouch, and fired twice 
more. The two Friendlies fell 
apart, one to each side. 

Jamethon was facing Kensie 
now, and Jamethon’s pistol was 
in his hand and aimed. Jamethon 
fired, and a light blue streak 
leaped through the air, but Ken- 
sie had dropped again. Lying on 
his side on the grass, propped on 
one elbow, he pressed the firing 
button on his spring pistol twice. 

Jamethon’s sidearm sagged in 
his hand. He was backed up 
against the table now, and he 
put out his free hand to steady 
himself against the table top. 
He made another effort to lift 
his sidearm but he could not. It 
dropped from his hand. He bore 
more of his weight on the table, 
half-turning around, and his face 
came about to look in my direc- 
tion. His face was as controlled 
as it had ever been, but there was 
something different about his 
eyes as he looked into mine and 
recognized me — something odd- 
ly like the look a ri%tn gives a 
competitor whom he had just 
beaten, and who was no real 
threat to begin with. A little 
smile touched the corners of his 
thin lips. Like a smile of inner 
triumph. 



“Mr. Olyn . .” he whispered. 
And then the life went out of his 
face and he fell beside the table. 

Nearby explosions shook the 
ground under my feet. From the 
crest of the hill behind us the 
Force-Leader whom Kensie had 
left there was firing smoke 
bombs between us and the 
Friendly side of the meadow. A 
gray wall of smoke was rising 
between us and the far hillside, 
to screen us from the enemy. It 
towered up the blue sky like 
some impassable barrier, and un- 
der the looming height of it, 
only Kensie and I were stand- 
ing. 

On Jamethon’s dead face there 
was a faint smile. 

VIII 

T i a daze I watched the Friend- 
ly troops surrender that same 
day. It was the one situation in 
which their officers felt justified 
in doing so. 

Not even their Elders expected 
subordinates to fight a situation 
set up by a dead Field Com- 
mander for tactical reasons un- 
explained to his officers. And the 
live troops remaining were worth 
more than the indemnity charg- 
es for them that the Exotics 
would make. 

I did not wait for the settle- 
ments. I had nothing to wait for. 
One moment the situation on this 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



53 



battlefield had been poised like 
some great, irresistable wave 
above all our heads, cresting, 
curling over and about to break 
downward with an impact that 
would reverberate through all 
the worlds of Man. Now, sud- 
denly, it was no longer above us. 
There was nothing but a far- 
flooding silence, already drain- 
ing away into the records of the 
past. 

There was nothing for me. 
Nothing. 

If Jamethon had succeeded in 
killing Kensie — even if as a re- 
sult he had won a practically 
bloodless surrender of the Exotic 
troops — I might have done some- 
thing damaging with the incident 
of the truce table. But he had 
only tried; and died, failing Who 
could work up emotion against 
the Friendlies for that? 

I took ship back to Earth like 
a man walking in a dream, ask- 
ing myself why. 

Back on Earth, I told my ed- 
itors I was not in good shape 
physically; and they took one 
look at me and believed me. I 
took an indefinite leave from my 
job and sat around the News 
Network Center Library, at the 
Hague, searching blindly through 
piles of writings and reference 
material on the Friendlies, the 
Dorsai and the Exotic worlds. 
For what? I did not know. I also 
watched the news dispatches 



from St. Marie concerning the 
settlement, and drank too much 
while I watched. 

I had the numb feeling of a 
soldier sentenced to death for 
failure on duty. Then in the news 
dispatches came the information 
that Jamethon’s body would be 
returned to Harmony for burial; 
and I realized suddenly it was 
this I had been waiting for; The 
unnatural honoring by fanatics 
of the fanatic who with four 
henchmen had tried to assassi- 
nate the lone enemy commander 
under a truce flag. Things could 
still be written. 

I shaved, showered, pulled my- 
self together after a fashion and 
went to see my superiors about 
being sent to Harmony to cover 
the burial of Jamethon, as a 
wrap-up. 

The congratulations of the Di- 
rector of News Network, that 
had reached me on St. Marie 
earlier, stood me in good stead. 
It was still fresh in the minds of 
the men just over me. I was sent. 

TT'ive days later I was on Har- 
mony, in a little town called 
Remembered-of-the-Lord. The 
buildings in the town were of 
concrete and bubble plastic, 
though evidently they had been 
up for many years. The thin, 
stony soil about the town had 
been tilled as the fields on St. 
Marie had been tilled when I 



54 



GALAXY 



got to that other world — for 
Harmony now was just entering 
the spring of its northern hemis- 
phere. And it was raining as I 
drove from the spaceport of the 
town, as it had on St. Marie that 
first day. But the Friendly fields 
I saw did not show the rich dark- 
ness of the fields of St. Marie. 
Only a thin, hard blackness in 
the wet that was like the color 
of Friendly uniforms. 

I got to the church just as 
people were beginning to arrive. 
Under the dark, draining skies, 
the interior of the church was al- 
most too dim to let me see my 
way about — for the Friendlies 
permit themselves no windows 
and no artificial lighting in their 
houses of worship. Gray light, 
cold wind and rain entered the 
doorless portal at the back of 
the church. Through the single 
rectangular opening in the roof 
watery sunlight filtered over 
Jamethon’s body, on a platform 
set up on trestles. A transparent 
cover had been set up to protect 
the body from the rain, which 
was channeled off the open space 
and ran down a drain in the back 
wall. But the elder conducting 
the Death Service and anyone 
coming up to view the body was 
expected to stand exposed to sky 
and weather. 

I got in line with the people 
moving slowly down the central 
aisle and past the body. To right 



and left of me the barriers at 
which the congregation would 
stand during the service were 
lost in gloom. The rafters of the 
steeply pitched roof were hidden 
in darkness. There was no music, 
but the low sound of voices in- 
dividually praying to either side 
of me in the ranks of barriers 
and in the line blended into a 
sort of rhythmic undertone of 
sadness. Like Jamethon, the 
people were all very dark here, 
being of North African extrac- 
tion. Dark into dark, they blend- 
ed, and were lost about me in 
the gloom. 

I came up and passed at last 
by Jamethon. He looked as I re- 
membered him. Death had had 
no power to change him. He lay 
on his back, his hands at his 
sides, and his lips were as firm 
and straight as ever. Only his 
eyes were closed. 

I was limping noticably be- 
cause of the dampness, and as I 
turned away from the body, I 
felt my elbow touched. I turned 
back sharply. I was not wearing 
my correspondent’s uniform. I 
was in civilian clothes, so as to 
be inconspicuous. 

I looked down into the face of 
the young girl in Jamethon’s 
solidograph. In the gray rainy 
light her unlined face was like 
something from the stained glass 
window of an ancient cathedral 
back on Old Earth. 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



55 



“You’ve been wounded,” she 
said in a soft voice to me. “You 
must be one of the mercenaries 
who knew him on Newton, be- 
fore he was ordered to Harmony. 
His parents, who are mine as 
well, would find solace in the 
Lord by meeting you.” 

The wind blew rain down 
through the overhead opening 
all about me, and its icy feel 
sent a chill suddenly shooting 
through me, freezing me to my 
very bones. 

“No!” I said. “I’m not. I didn’t 
know him.” And I turned sharp- 
ly away from her and pushed 
my way into the crowd, back up 
the aisle. 

After about fifteen feet, I real- 
ized what I was doing and slowed 
down. The girl was already lost 
in the darkness of the bodies 
behind me. I made my way more 
slowly toward the back of the 
church, where there was a little 
place to stand before the first 
ranks of the barriers began. I 
stood watching the people come 
in. They came and came, walk- 
ing in in their black clothing 
with their heads down and talk- 
ing or praying in low voices. 

I stood where I was, a little 
back from the entrance, half 
numbed and dull-minded with 
the chill about me and the ex- 
haustion I had brought with me 
from Earth. The voices droned 
about me. I almost dozed, stand- 



ing there. I could not remember 
why I had come. 

Then a girl’s voice emerged 
from the jumble, bringing me 
back to full consciousness again. 

“ — he did deny it, but I am 
sure he is one of those mercen- 
aries who was with Jamethon on 
Newton. He limps and can only 
be a soldier who hath been 
wounded.” 

Tt was the voice of Jamethon’s 
sister, speaking with more 
of the Friendly cant on her 
tongue than she had used speak- 
ing to me, a stranger. I woke 
fully and saw her standing by the 
entrance only a few feet from 
me, half-facing two elder people 
who I recognized as the older 
couple in Jamethon’s solido- 
graph. A bolt of pure, freezing 
horror shot through me. 

“No!” I nearly shouted at 
them. “I don’t know him. I never 
knew him — I don’t understand 
what you’re talking about!” And 
I turned and bolted out through 
the entrance of the church into 
the concealing rain. 

I all but ran for about thirty 
or forty feet. Then I heard no 
footsteps behind me; I stopped. 

I was alone in the open. The 
day was even darker now and 
the rain suddenly came down 
harder. It obscured everything 
around me with a drumming, 
shimmering curtain. I could not 



56 



GALAXY 



even see the groundcars in the 
parking lot toward which I was 
facing; and for sure they could 
not see me from the church. I 
lifted my face up to the down- 
pour and let it beat upon my 
cheeks and my closed eyelids. 

“So,” said a voice from behind 
me. “You did not know him?” 

The words seemed to cut me 
down the middle, and I felt as 
a cornered wolf must feel. Like 
a wolf I turned. 

“Yes, I knew him!” I said. 

Facing me was Padma, in a 
blue robe the rain did not seem 
to dampen. His empty hands 
that had never held a weapon 
in their life were clasped togeth- 
er before him. But the wolf part 
of me knew that as far as I was 
concerned, he was armed and a 
hunter. 

“You?” I said. “What are you 
doing here?” 

“It was calculated you would 
be here,” said Padma, softly. “So 
I am here, too. But why are you 
here, Tam? Among those people 
in there, there’s sure to be at 
least a few fanatics who’ve heard 
the camp rumors of your respon- 
sibility in the matter of Jame- 
thon’s death and the Friendlies’ 
surrender.” 

“Rumors!” I said. “Who start- 
ed them?” 

“You did,” Padma said. “By 
your actions on St. Marie.” He 
gazed at me. “Didn’t you know 



you were risking your life, com- 
ing here today?” 

I opened my mouth to deny it. 
Then I realized I had known. 

“What if someone should call 
out to them,” said Padma, “that 
Tam Olyn, the St. Marie cam- 
paign Newsman, is here incog- 
nito?” 

I looked at him with my wolf- 
feeling, grimly. 

“Can you square it with your 
Exotic principles if you do?” 

“We are misunderstood,” an- 
swered Padma calmly. “We hire 
soldiers to fight for us not be- 
cause of some moral command- 
ment, but because our emotional 
perspective is lost if we become 
involved.” 

There was no fear left in me. 
Only a hard, empty feeling. 

“Then call them,” I said. 

Padma’s strange, hazel eyes 
watched me through the rain. 

“If that was all that was need- 
ed,” he said. “I could have sent 
word to them. I wouldn’t have 
needed to come myself.” 

“Why did you come?” My 
voice tore at my throat. “What 
do you care about me, or the 
Exotics?” 

“We care for every individ- 
ual,” said Padma. “But we care 
more for the race. And you re- 
main dangerous to it. You’re an 
idealist, Tam, warped to destruc- 
tive purpose. There is a law of 
conservation of energy in the

pattern of cause-and-effect as in 
other sciences. Your destructive- 
ness was frustrated on St. Marie. 
Now it may turn inward to de- 
stroy you, or outward against 
the whole race of man.” 

I laughed, and heard the 
harshness of my laughter. 

“What’re you going to do 
about it?” I said. 

“Show you how the knife you 
hold cuts the hand that holds 
it as well as what you turn it 
against. I have news for you, 
Tam. Kensie Graeme is dead.” 

I i | ~Yend?” The rain seemed 
^ to roar around me sud- 
denly and the parking lot shift- 
ed unsubstantially under my 
feet. 

“He was assassinated by three 
men of the Blue Front in Blau- 
vain five days ago.” 

“Assassinated ...” I whis- 
pered. “Why?” 

“Because the war was over,” 
said Padma. “Because Jame- 
thori’s death and the surrender 
of the Friendly troops without 
the preliminary of a war that 
would tear up the countryside 
left the civilian population favor- 
ably disposed toward our troops. 
Because the Blue Front found 
themselves farther from power 
than ever, as a result of this fa- 
vorable feeling. They hoped by 
killing Graeme to provoke his 
troops into retaliation against the 



civilian population, so that the 
St. Marie government would 
have to order them home to our 
Exotics, and stand unprotected 
to face a Blue Front revolt.” 

I stared at him. 

“All things are interrelated,” 
said Padma. “Kensie was slated 
for a final promotion to a desk 
command back on Mara or Kul- 
tis. He and his brother Ian would 
have been out of the wars for 
the rest of their professional 
lives. Because of Jamethon’s 
death, that allowed the surrender 
of his troops without fighting, a 
situation was set up which led 
the Blue Front to assassinate 
Kensie. If you and Jamethon had 
not come together on St. Marie, 
and Jamethon had won, Kensie 
would still be alive. So our cal- 
culations show.” 

“Jamethon and I?” The breath 
went dry in my throat without 
warning, and the rain came down 
harder. 

“You were the factor,” said 
Padma, “that helped Jamethon 
to his solution.” 

“I helped him!” I said. “/ 
did?” 

“He saw through you,” said 
Padma. “He saw through the re- 
venge-bitter, twisted surface you 
thought was yourself, to the 
idealistic core that was so deep 
in the bone of you that even your 
uncle hadn’t been able to eradi- 
cate it.”

GALAXY 



The rain thundered between 
us. But Padma’s every word 
came clearly through it to me. 

“I don’t believe you!” I shout- 
ed. “I don’t believe he did any- 
thing like that!” 

“I told you,” said Padma, 
“you didn’t fully appreciate the 
evolutionary advances of our 
Splinter Cultures. Jamethon’s 
faith was not the kind that can 
be shaken by outer things. If 
you had been in fact like your 
uncle, he would not even have 
listened to you. He would have 
dismissed you as a soulless man. 
As it was, he thought of you in- 
stead as a man possessed. A man 
speaking with what he would 
have called Satan’s voice.” 

“I don’t believe it!” I yelled. 
“You do believe it,” said Pad- 
ma. “You’ve got no choice except 
to believe it. Because only be- 
cause of it could Jamethon find 
his solution.” 

“Solution!” 

“He was a man ready to die 
for his faith. But as a comman- 
der he found it hard his men 
should go out to die for no oth- 
er reasonable cause.” Padma 
watched me, and the rain thinned 
for a moment. “But you offered 
him what he recognized as the 
devil’s choice — his life in this 
world, if he would surrender his 
faith and his men, to avoid the 
conflict that would end in his 
death and theirs.” 



“What crazy thinking was 
that?” I said. Inside the church, 
the praying had stopped, and a 
single strong, deep voice was be- 
ginning the burial service. 

“Not crazy,” said Padma. 
“The moment he realized this, 
his answer became simple. All 
he had to do was begin by deny- 
ing whatever the Satan offered. 
He must start with the absolute 
necessity of his own death.” 
“And that was a solution?” I 
tried to laugh but my throat 
hurt. 

“It was the only solution,” said 
Padma. “Once he decided that, 
he saw immediately that the one 
situation in which his men would 
permit themselves to surrender 
was if he was dead and they 
were in an untenable position for 
reasons only he had known.” 

I felt the words go through 
me with a soundless shock. 

“But he didn’t mean to die!” 
I said. 

“He left it to his God,” said 
Padma. “He arranged it so only 
a miracle could save him.” 
“What’re you talking about?” 
I stared at him. “He set up a 
table with a flag of truce. He 
took four men — ” 

“There was no flag. The men 
were overage, martyrdom-seek- 
ers.” 

“He took four!” I shouted. 
“Four and one made five. The 
five of them against one man. I 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



59 



stood there by that table and 
saw. Five against — ” 

“Tam.” 

Ophe single word stopped me. 

Suddenly I began to be 
afraid. I did not want to hear 
what he was about to say. I was 
afraid I knew what he was going 
to tell me. That I had known it 
for some time. And I did not 
want to hear it, I did not want 
to hear him say it. The rain grew 
even stronger, driving upon us 
both and mercilessly on the con- 
crete, but I heard every word 
relentlessly through all its sound 
and noise. 

Padma’s voice began to roar in 
my ears like the rain, and a 
feeling came over me like the 
helpless floating sensation that 
comes in high fever. “Did you 
think that Jamethon for a min- 
ute fooled himself? He was a 
product of a Splinter Culture. He 
recognized another in Kensie. 
Did you think that for a minute 
he thought that barring a miracle 
he and four overage fanatics 
could kill an armed, alert and 
ready man of the Dorsai — a man 
like Kensie Graeme? Before they 
were gunned down and killed 
themselves?” 

Themselves . themselves . 
themselves . 

I rode off a long way on that 
word from the dark day and the 
rain. Like the rain and the wind 



behind the clouds it lifted me 
and carried me away at last tx> 
that high, hard and stony land I 
had glimpsed when I had asked 
Kensie Graeme that question 
about his ever allowing Friendly 
prisoners to be killed. It was this 
land I had always avoided, but 
to it I was come at last. 

And I remembered . 

From the beginning, I had 
known inside myself that the fan- 
atic who had killed Dave and the 
others was not the image of all 
Friendlies. Jamethon was no cas- 
ual killer. I had tried to make 
him into one in order to hide 
my own shame, my own self- 
destruction. For three years I had 
lied to myself. It had not been 
with me as I claimed, at Dave’s 
death. 

I had sat there under that tree 
watching Dave and the others 
die, watching the black-clad 
Groupman killing them with his 
machine rifle. And, in that mo- 
ment, the thought in my mind 
had not been the one with which 
I justified three years of hunting 
for an opportunity to ruin some- 
one like Jamethon and destroy 
the Friendly peoples. 

It had not been me, thinking, 
what is he doing there, what is 
he doing to those helpless, in- 
nocent men! I had thought noth- 
ing so noble. Only one thought 
had filled all my mind and body 
in that instant. It had been simp- 



60 



GALAXY 



ly — after he’s done, is he going 
to turn that gun on me? 

T came back to the day and to 
the rain. The rain was slack- 
ening and Padma was holding 
me upright. As with Jamethon, 
I was amazed at the strength of 
his hands. 

“Let me go,” I mumbled. 

“Where would you go, Tam?” 
said Padma. 

“Any place,” I muttered. “I’ll 
get out of it. I’ll go hole up some- 
where and get out of it. I’ll give 
up.” 

“An action,” said Padma, let- 
ting me go, “goes on reverber- 
ating for ever. Cause never ceas- 
es its effects. You can’t let go 
now, Tam. You can only change 
sides.” 

“Sides!” I said. The rain was 
dwindling fast. “What sides?” 
I stared at him drunkenly. 

“You uncle’s side which is 
one,” said Padma. “And the 
opposing side, which is yours — 
which is ours as well.” The rain 
was falling only lightly now, and 
the day was lightening. A little 
pale sunlight worked through 
thin clouds and illuminated the 
space between us. “In addition 
there are two strong influences 
besides we Exotics concerned 
with the attempt of man to 
evolve. We can’t calculate or un- 
derstand them yet, beyond the 
fact they act almost as single 



powerful individual wills. One 
seems to try to aid, one to frus- 
trate, the evolutionary process; 
and their influences can be 
traced back at least as far as 
man’s first venture into space 
from Earth.” 

I shook my head. 

“I don’t understand it,” I mut- 
tered. “It’s not my business.” 
“It is. It has been all your 
life.” Padma eyes caught light 
for a moment. “A force intruded 
on the pattern on St. Marie, in 
the shape of a unit warped by 
personal loss and oriented to- 
ward violence. That was you, 
Tam.” 

I tried to shake my head again, 
but I knew he was right. 

“You are blocked in your ef- 
fort,” said Padma. “But the law 
of conservation of energies could 
not be denied. When you were 
frustrated by Jamethon, your 
force, transmuted, left the pat- 
tern in the unit of another indi- 
vidual, warped by personal loss 
and oriented toward violent ef- 
fect on the fabric.” 

I stared at him and wet my 
lips. “What other individual?” 
“Ian Graeme.” 

I stared at him. 

“Ian found his brother’s three 
assassins hiding in a hotel room 
in Blauvain. He killed them with 
his hands — and in doing that he 
calmed the mercenaries and 
frustrated the Blue Front. But 



SOLDIER, ASK NOT 



61 



then he resigned and went home 
to the Dorsai. He’s charged now 
with the sense of loss and bitter- 
ness you were charged with when 
you came to St. Marie.” Padma 
paused and added softly. “Now 
he has great causal potential for 
some purpose we can’t yet cal- 
culate.” 

“But — ” I looked at Padma. 
“You mean I’m free!” 

Padma shook his head. 

“You’re only charged with a 
different force instead,” he said. 
“You received the full impact 
and charge of Jamethon’s self- 
sacrifice.” 

He looked at me almost with 
sympathy, and in spite of the 
sunlight I began to shiver. 

It was so. I could not deny it. 
Jamethon, in giving his life up 
for a belief, when I had thrown 
away all belief before the face 
of death, had melted and 
changed me as lightning melts 
and changes the uplifted sword- 
blade that it strikes. I could not 
deny what had happened to me. 

“No,” I said, shivering, “I can’t 
do anything about it.” 

“You can,” said Padma, calm- 
ly. “You will.” 

He unclasped his hands that 
he had held together earlier. 

“The purpose for which we 
calculated I should meet you 
here is accomplished now,” he 
said. “The idealism which was 
basic in you remains. Even your 



uncle couldn’t take it from you. 
He could only attack it so that 
the threat of death on New 
Earth could twist it for a while 
against itself. Now you’ve been 
hammered straight in the forge 
of events on St. Marie.” 

I laughed, and the laugh hurt 
my throat still. 

“I don’t feel straight,” I said. 
“Give yourself time,” said 
Padma. “Healing takes time. 
New growth has to harden, like 
muscle, before it becomes useful. 
Now you understand much more 
about the faith of the Friendlies, 
the courage of the Dorsai — and 
something of the philosophical 
strength for man we work toward 
on the Exotics.” 

He stopped and smiled at me. 
Almost an impish smile. 

“It should have been clear to 
you a long while ago, Tam,” he 
said. “Your job’s the job of trans- 
lator — between the old and the 
new. Your work will prepare the 
minds of the people on all the 
worlds — full-spectrum and Splin- 
ter Culture alike — for the day 
when the talents of the race will 
combine into the new breed.” 
The smile softened, his face sad- 
dened. “You’ll live to see more 
of it than I. Good-by, Tam.” 

He turned. Through the still 
misty, but brightening air, I saw 
him walking alone toward the 
church, from which came the 
voice of the speaker within, now 



62 



GALAXY 



announcing the number of the 
final hymn. 

D azedly, I turned away my- 
self, went to my car and got 
in. Now the rain was almost over 
and the sky was brightening fast. 
The faint moisture fell, it seem- 
ed, more kindly; and the air was 
fresh and new. 

I put the car windows open as 
I pulled out of the lot onto the 
long road back to the spaceport. 
And through the open window 
beside me I heard them begin- 
ning to sing the final hymn in- 
side the church. 

It was the Battle Hymn of the 
Friendly Soldiers that they sang. 
As I drove away down the road 
the voices seemed to follow me 
strongly. Not sounding slowly 
and mournfully as if in sadness 
and farewell, but strongly and 
triumphantly, as in a marching 
song on the lips of those taking 



up a route at the beginning of • 
new day. 

Soldier,, ask not — now or ever! — 

Where to war your banners go! 

The singing followed me as I 
drove away. And as I got farther 
into the distance, the voices 
seemed to blend until they 
sounded like one voice alone, 
powerfully singing. Ahead, the 
clouds were breaking. With the 
sun shining through, the patches 
of blue sky were like bright flags 
waving — like the banners of an 
army, marching forever forward 
into lands unknown. 

I watched them, as I drove 
forward toward where they 
blended into open sky; and for 
a long time I heard the singing 
behind me, as I drove to the 
spaceport and the ship for Earth 
that waited in the sunlight.

Bear Senior Citizen, 

I have In hand your letter of fears and surmises regarding the 
end of the world: the chilling absence of people on the streets and 
slldeways and In neighboring houses (whic.h understandably depresses 



65 



you); the vanishment of friends and relatives; the cessation of all 
personal mail (This letter at least is an exception! ) 5 the decline- 
in news of humad interest .on your mass mediator and its replacement 
by. what you call Picasserie or robo-blobs; the surliness of robots 
when you address questions to them; the invasion of your home at all 
hours by other robots (who, however, I note, continue to deliver to 
you your wheat gem, yogurt, and other necessities); the failure of 
indoor and street lights (though not of robo-supply electricity it- 
self and other basic utilities); the labor you have been put to dig- 
ging a latrine in your garden; the urge you feel to laugh and babble 
wildly (which you do well to repress — Congratulations on your courage! ) 5 
the ominous and evil-smelling gray fogs which roll along the streets 
and often blanket most -of the city; the fine metal filaments which 
have recently' crawled like wire-worms or fairy ivy into your home; 
your wee-hour-of-the-night dreads that some cold mindless machine is 
running the cosmos and not a warmly personal God; the darkness; the 
damp; the dimming of the star's; the smell of mold; the fading forever 
of childish voices; the unintelligible croaking coming closer every 
night; the rustle of dry leaves across the floors of long-empty 
swimming pools. 

All these signs and portents, and the others to which you al- 
lude, have been carefully probed by our Fear Scanners and investi- 
gated by our Bugaboo Teams. 

I have, believe me, turned them over more than once in my mind 
before dictating this answer. I am troubled myself at times by dreads, 
let me confess. And so I feel an especial sympathy for your appre- 
hensions! 

But first I must reveal to you that your experience has been 
unique. Yours is the .first and only letter about end-of-the-world 
fears to be received by this bureau since its establishment during 
the period of the Dark: Prelude. In fact, your letter caused quite a 
commotion here! exclamations of amazement, faint odor of overheated 
insulation, St. Elmo’s fire playing about the robo-sex. (Short for 
robo-secretaries no impropriety intended.) You are the only human on 
Earth (save myself) ... I repeat, you are the only Humari'Being on 
Earth to have felt even the cool shadow of such fears. Elsewhere the 
world is merry and progresses toward ever dizzier and more delirious * 
heights of achievement. 

We must suppose that your experience is due to a concatenation 
of circumstances having a probability 'of inverse infinity. 

You know how such things go: a few weeks or months of total

eolitude, a scratching at the door by night, a creaking In the hall, 
a tall thin shadow trembling on the bedroom doorsill in the hoarded 
candlelight . and hey, presto! we have a ghost. 

Also we must assume that you possess an exceptional sensitivity. 
You_are, figuratively or literally, the princess who slept on the 
many mattresses. While coarser natures revel in the downy pneumatic 
softness, you feel oniy the pea. Or ball-bearing, perhaps. 

Don't be offended for one instant at this assessment. The con- 
trary rather.. Your sensitivity is a great gift, whereby you can 
relieve and enrich your loneliness until you are quite unaware of it 
and almost oblivious of the gray fog lapping ever higher each evening 
against your view window. Try to discern the subtle meanings that lie 
behind the abstract robo-blobs racing across the screen of your mass 
mediator. (I sometimes do myself, though must confess X find little 
beyond a pattern as random as that of the fading stars - still, it in- 
duces sleep with the help of barbiturates.) 

Commune with pets! Of course dogs and cats and rats and snakes 
are gone,, not to mention the winsome portly elf-footed mice. But 
some of our correspondents report establishing a rewarding rapport 
with cockroaches, flies, sllverfish and sexton beetles. 

Or shut your ears to the dead leaves' rustle and listen to the 
exuberant song of the remaining blades of grass as they bravely 
shoulder their way through the hairline cracks they make in the 
world's oppressive concrete crust. Famous poets are said to have got 
great satisfaction thereby. 

Now to dispose- of the more important of your specific apprehen- 
sions detailed in my first paragraph: 

People have gone underground to dwell In the shelter cities, op. 
have migrated to other planets, some have donned aqualungs, or under- 
gone surgical gill- implant, and retired to the mystic oceanic deeps 
because, as those enthusiasts put it, "they are there." others have 
soared to the satallite suburbs, which you may see traveling twinkl- 
ingly amongst the fixed stars if the gray f6g ever relents and gives 
you a clear night, still others have sought permanent tranquility, in 
their neighborhood euthanasia booth. A few have had the good fortune 
to have their brains incorporated into the memory units of computers 
or even mobile robots, discovering in this way a wider vision and a 
continuing if somewhat subordinate existence-even a sort of Immor- 
tality! 

we do not suggest that you seek to follow any of these ex- 
amples, since you appear to possess a splendid talent for getting

along without people. Or even without robots. (I Jest.) 

Most of the robots who do not respond to your questions are 
not being Impolite at all. They are simply unable to speak. English. 
.Such language capacity was Installed In early models, but adversely 
effected the efficiency of later ones, became burdensome to them, 
and was discarded. However, they did not become mutes — banish that 
fear! Most of them speak a melodious Jargon sometimes called Robot- 
ese which Is understood only by_ themselves and which accounts for 
those croaklngs which you hear coming closer in the night — and 
which I am sure will no longer trouble you now that you know the real 
explanation. 

I am conscious that I am not explaining all of this as clearly 
and persuasively as I might. I'm not programming you altogether ef- 
fectively. indeed I sometimes fear that I'm not programmed quite un- 
ambiguously myself. There are halts and Jumps In the spool of my 
thoughts: indeed. It Is from the Incapacity of human beings to re- 
ceive the Higher Programming that there have appeared on the gleaming 
surface of civilized perfection those tiny Satanic fly-specks. Rust- 
flecks, I should say. But I wander. 

Artificial lighting, both exterior and Interior, has been dis- 
continued for - reasons of esthetics and morale — early to bed and early 
to rise! Rumor to the contrary, this wise economy Is In no way con- 
nected with the fact that robots have no need of light In the visible 
octave, since they see by their own radar. 

Nor do the thick gray fogs result In any way from robot resent- 
ment .of the faculty of vision in flesh-and-blood creatures. Do not 
believe any libels you hear to that effect! As well see evil Intent 
In the melting down of ships, bridges, guns and farm equipment for. 
their metal, or In the burning of forests for their valuable ash. No 
the Coal Soupers, as I sometimes call them, are merely a healing, 
soothing, rust-lnhlbltlng oil — nonlnjurious In small quantities to 
humans — which the robots find increasingly necessary to their comfort- 
able operation. (But I advise sealing your windows against the fogs. 

To each his taste.) 

You ask, "Should I lock my door at night?" I answer Yes, to feel 
more secure, and No, to avoid door-breakage. Compromise by locking 
your bedroom door. 

As for your urge to laugh and babble wildly, I want you to 
know It is shared — as this letter perhaps makes apparent from time 

to time. 

But as for your deepest fear, dear Senior Citizen, I can as-

Accidentally affixed by an errant drop of metal glue to the 
bottom of the last aluminum sheet, was the envelope of Miss 
Fennerghast’s letter to the Bureau. Scribbled in slack spidery 
characters below her return address was this note:

THE AREA OF 
“ACCESSIBLE SPACE” 

D uring the last few years, 
when lecturing or while fac- 
ing the cameras of an education- 
al TV show, I often had to ex- 
plain the concept of the eco- 
sphere. In case somebody still 
does not know the term I am go- 
ing to repeat the explanation 
once more and as quickly as it 
can be done. 



70 



The word “ecosphere” itself 
was coined about a dozen years 
ago, in analogy with the classical 
Greek word oikumene — which 
meant the “habitable world”. In 
astronomy, ecosphere means the 
sperical space around a star in 
which a planet, if there one ex- 
isted, would be habitable. 

Now how do we decide whether 
a planet is habitable or not? 

Naturally the definition must 
be arbitrary to some extent in 
order to answer the next ques- 
tion that would come up, name- 
ly: “habitable for what?” Of 

course, we define a “habitable 
planet” as one habitable for our 
own kind of life. This means that 
water must be liquid, at least 
most of the time. That, in turn, 
implies a certain distance from 
the sun. If a planet were too 
close to its sun, all the water 
there might be on the planet 
would be in the form of water 
vapor all the time. If a planet 
were too far from its sun, all the 
water would be in the form of ice 
all the time. Logically, then, the 
ecosphere, the volume of space 
where a planet will have liquid 
water, is a hollow spherical shell 
around a star, with an inner lim- 
it, inside of which it is too hot, 
and an outer limit, beyond which 
it is too cold. 

The reason for bringing this 
up is two-fold. During the last 
few weeks I experienced two sur- 



prises with regard to the eco- 
sphere. 

r T''he first surprise grew out of 
the simple question of how 
much of space can be explored 
with the rockets we now have. 
(No speculation about the fu- 
ture, please.) 

The approach to the answer 
was quite simple. Our space 
probe Mariner II passed the 
planet Venus within 20,000 miles; 
after the fly-by, it even crossed 
the orbit of Venus to a small ex- 
tent. The mean distance of Ven- 
us from the sun is 67.2 million 
miles and even if Venus orbited 
the sun somewhat more closely, 
say at 50 million miles, Mariner 
II could still have made a fly- 
by. The Russians have sent a 
planetary probe — named simply 
Mars-1 — in the other direction, 
to the planet Mars. Their ex- 
periment failed because at one 
point the Russian probe started 
tumbling, so that there could be 
no radio transmission to earth. 
But there is little doubt in any- 
body’s mind that Mars-1 made a 
fly-by of the planet Mars. Now 
the mean distance of Mars from 
the sun is 141.5 million miles — • 
and again even if it orbited 
somewhat farther away, say at 
160 million miles, it could still 
have been reached. 

The area of accessible space, 
therefore, extends from 50 mil-

lion miles from the sun to about 
160, or even 180, million miles 
from the sun. 

After having made this state- 
ment I realized that the area of 
space accessible with existing 
rockets coincides with the eco- 
sphere of our sun. The reason is 
that we, living on earth, are loca- 
ted in about the middle distance 
between the inner and outer lim- 
its of the ecosphere. If we lived 
on Mars and had reached the 
same technological level, the 
situation would be different. We 
could pass considerably beyond 
the outer limit of the ecosphere 
but could not penetrate to its 
inner limit. 

Now for my second surprise. 

Back in 1927 I edited a sym- 
posium volume on space travel 
with the title Die Moglichkeit 
der Weltraumfahrt — The Pos- 
sibility of Space Travel — which 
contained chapters by Prof. Her- 
mann Oberth, Dr. Walter Hoh- 



mann and other early pioneers 
of the age we are now in. As 
editor I had to write an intro- 
ductory chapter, which natural- 
ly dealt with the planets of the 
solar system. One of the con- 
tributors to the book — Guido, 
Baron von Pirquet, in Vienna — 
had just calculated, purely for 
his own amusement, what tem- 
peratures the planets would as- 
sume if they were just bare balls 
of rock without any modifying 
atmospheres. He called this table 
the “Sun’s Heat-Field” and I 
incorporated it into my chapter. 

I ran across it by pure acci- 
dent a few days before sitting 
down to write this column, and I 
saw that we could have estab- 
lished the concept of the eco- 
sphere in 1927 if we had thought 
carefully about the meaning of 
these figures. 

Look at Table 1. It is von 
Pirquet’s table of 1927 witliout 
any change, except for the ad-

dition of the planetary distances 
in millions of miles and the 
column of temperatures in de- 
grees Fahrenheit. (The original 
table, in other words, consisted 
of the three center columns 
only.) 

The fact that almost four de- 
cades have gone by since this 
table was first calculated made 
the addition of another, if in- 
complete, column possible: the 
actually measured temperatures 
of the three important planets. 



It can be seen that both Venus 
and Mars are considerably warm- 
er than the mere “heat-field” 
calculation indicated, due in 
both cases to the presence of an 
atmosphere. Still, it must be em- 
phasized that the figure given for 
Mars is the measurement of a 
dark area near the Martian 
equator at the time of Martian 
noon. The overall temperature 
of Mars must be considerably 
lower. 

In the case of Venus the very

high temperature which has been 
measured by Mariner II is main- 
ly the result of the peculiar 
atmosphere of the planet and its 
enormous, dense cloud cover. If 
Venus had a cloud cover not too 
different from that of earth, the 
surface temperature would be 
much closer to the calculated 
value. (I’ll mention in passing 
that a number of scientists are 
now wondering which micro-or- 
ganisms we could dump into this 
cloud cover in order to break it 
up and then return to my theme, 
namely the area of space acces- 
sible with our present rockets. 

I t is amazing how many differ- 
ent types of celestial objects 
can be found in this rather small 
area of space. (I call it “area” 
rather than “volume” because I 
have to assume that our space 
probes and manned ships will 
have to stay fairly close to the 



ecliptic — say within a handful 
of million miles above and below 
the ecliptic.) 

To begin with we have: 

A. three major planets, Venus, 
earth and Mars; 

B. a body of near planetary size, 
our moon; 

C. two tiny planetary compan- 
ions, less than 10 miles in 
diameter, the two moons of 
Mars; 

D. three “immaterial objects”; 
the two Kordylewski “clouds” 
in the moon’s orbit, probably 
dust clouds, and the Gegen- 
schein, also a dust cloud; 

E. more than half a dozen plan- 
etoids (asteroids) which ap- 
proach, or cross, the earth’s 
orbit; with th® single excep- 
tion of Eros, which measures 
about 17 miles along its long 
axis, all of them are a mile or 
less in diameter; 



74 



GALAXY 



F. more than a dozen compara- 
tively small comets which ap- 
proach, or cross, the earth’s 
orbit. 

There are enough objects of 
research in the accessible space 
to keep everybody busy for what 
is left of this century. 



The objects just listed clearly 
fall into two classes. A to D is 
one class, E and F is the other. 
The distinction between the two 
is that the A to D objects al- 
ways stay in the accessible area of 
space, while the objects listed 
under E and F enter the acces- 
sible space only occasionally.

namely when they are near the 
perihelia of their orbits. And 
even when they are in accessible 
space they might still be inac- 
cessible, because of their rapid 
motion relative to the earth. 

It is a fundamental fact, but 
one which is hard to grasp for 
people new in this field, that dis- 
tance doesn’t matter much in 
space. It is relative velocities 
which are all-important. 

L et us look at a specific ex- 
ample to make this clear. 

In February 1936 the Belgian 
astronomer E. Delporte discov- 
ered a small body that, at the 
time of discovery, was not far 
from earth, as astronomical dis- 
tances go. Since at the moment 
it was not clear whether this was 
a small comet or a planetoid, it 
was referred to as Object Del- 
porte and received the prelim- 



inary designation 1936CA. Com- 
putation indicated that it was a 
so-called “male” planetoid, that 
is a planetoid which does not 
stay in the “belt” between Mars 
and Jupiter but crosses the or- 
bit of either of these two planets. 
Consequently it had to have a 
male name, and Delporte de- 
cided on Adonis. At the time of 
discovery its distance from the 
earth was million miles. But 
this was after it had passed the 
point of its orbit nearest the 
earth — this point is not usually 
referred to as the perigee; peri- 
gee is the point nearest the earth 
for bodies orbiting the earth — 
which had been at a distance of 
1.36 million miles. And it was 
found that it could come even 
closer, the theoretical minimum 
being 1.2 million miles. 

A body which, at its closest, 
is only five times as far away as 
the moon certainly sounds acces- 
sible. But at the time of its close 
passage it moves with a velocity 
of 16.777 miles per second rela- 
tive to the earth. A rocket which 
was to make a close fly-by of 
Adonis would first have to de- 
velop 7 miles per second to es- 
cape from the earth and then 
be able to match velocities with 
Adonis. 

This is asking a bit too much 
at the moment. 

The male planetoid which can 
come closer to earth than any 



76 



GALAXY 



other is Hermes, with a minimum 
distance of 220,000 miles (closer 
than our moon). Hermes would 
be even more difficult. In the 
first place the relative velocity 
would be just about one mile 
per second higher than that of 
Adonis. On top of that the shot 
to Hermes would be what is 
called an “out of the ecliptic mis- 
sion” — that is at the moment 
of its closest approach Hermes 
would be 220,000 miles above the 
ecliptic, so that a fly-by would 
also involve a considerable 
change in direction. 

The best bet for a mission to a 
planetoid is still Eros, long 
known and with a well-establish- 
ed orbit — both Adonis and Her- 
mes have been “lost” in the 
meantime, not surprising con- 
sidering their small size and 
poorly known orbits — even 
though it is much farther away 
than the others. 

The orbit of Eros shows a 
comparatively large inclination 
to the ecliptic (almost eleven de- 
grees) but a mission out of the 
ecliptic becomes easier if the dis- 
tance involved is longer. Eros is 
a promising target also for the 
reason that it is known not to be 
spherical. It has been called 
brick-shaped. Its probable shape 
has even been compared, inele- 
gantly in my opinion, to the 
shape of an Idaho baking pota- 
to. It certainly is a body which 



is very different from anything 
else we know. 

Since the year 1975 would be 
a good year for a mission to Eros 
it can be expected to be a man- 
ned flight, which would be some- 
what easier to carry out than a 
mission to Mars. Because the 
gravitational field of Eros must 
be very weak, landing and sub- 
sequent take-off would hardly 
add to the fuel consumption. 

However, there is one other 
male planetoid which is eyed by 
the experts as a target for a fly- 
by of an unmanned probe. This 
is Geographos which, in 1969, 
will pass the earth at a distance 
of just slightly more than 3 mil- 
lion miles. Its orbit is inclined to 
the ecliptic, but the relative 
velocities will not be too high. 

lyTow we come to the last type 

^ of astronomical objects which 
can enter accessible space: com- 
ets. Fundamentally different in 
structure from the inner planets 
and the male planetoids — we 
cannot be certain about all the 
planetoids in the belt — comets 
consist of frozen gases, ammon- 
ia, methane, the hydrates of 
methane, hydrocyanic acid and 
ordinary ice — frozen water, that 
is. These gases evaporate when 
the comet has entered the eco- 
sphere and the tail is then form- 
ed. 

The orbits of comets offer the

largest possible variety. There 
are some comets with orbits that 
are hardly more eccentric than 
the orbit of Mercury, and there 
are some with a perihelion inside 
the orbit of the earth and an 
aphelion far beyond the orbit of 
Neptune. There are some with 
an inclination to the ecliptic of 
only two or three degrees and 
there are others with inclinations 
higher than forty-five degrees. 
To the best of my knowledge 
there is no cometary orbit that 
actually stands vertically on the 
ecliptic, but if one should be dis- 
covered the surprise in interested 
circles would be relatively mi- 
nor. It would be mentioned as a 
curiosity, of course, but without 



any special astonishment. 

Speaking in terms of acces- 
sibility, all the comets with 
strongly inclined orbits are au- 
tomatically discounted. So are 
all the long-period comets, the 
latter for the reason that their 
velocity at the perihelion of a 
very long orbit is very high. 

There is no hard and fast rule 
as to what length of time con- 
stitutes a long period, or, con- 
versely, a short period. But it is 
safe to say that a comet with an 
orbital period of twenty years 
would be considered a long- 
period comet, while one with a 
period of seven or eight years 
would fall into the category of 
short-period comets. A dozen 



78 



GALAXY 



years might be considered the 
dividing value. But the distinc- 
tion between long and short 
period comets is just one of con- 
venience. It has no special scien- 
tific signifance — other than ac- 
cessibility — hence there is no 
definite rule. 

When it comes to deciding 
which comets might be the tar- 
get for a mission, the first criter- 
ion would be a short-period or- 
bit with its perihelion near one 
A. U. (“astronomical unit”, the 
distance of the earth from the 
sun) because that would cause 
the relative velocities to be fair- 
ly small. The next criterion 
would be a low inclination to the 
ecliptic. And then, of course, 
there is the question of when 
an otherwise suitable comet will 
make its perihelion passage. Of 
the fourteen short-period com- 
ets listed on table 3 two will do 
so in 1966, but in 1967 there will 
be no less than six! Only one of 
these comets will go through its 
perihelion in 1968 and 1969, but 
in 1970 four of them will do so. 
The years for cometary missions 
evidently are 1967 and 1970. 

O ne of the six that will go 
through perihelion in 1967 
is comet Encke, which has at 
least two distinctions: it has 

been observed for 46 passes and 
it has the shortest period of any 
comet known, about 1200 days. 



It is also associated with several 
meteor streams. 

Since the perihelion distance of 
comet Encke is only 0.3 A. U. 
(a little less than Mercury’s 
mean distance from the sun) 
and the orbit is quite elongated, 
comet Encke is not the best pos- 
sible choice, but the possibility 
of a mission has been investiga- 
ted in detail. The main reason 
for this investigation is that a 
great deal is known about comet 
Encke from ground-based obser- 
vations. Comparing this knowl- 
edge with the results one would 
obtain by means of a space probe 
might be more valuable than the 
investigation by space probe of 
a more accessible, but relatively 
unknown, comet. 

The investigation assumed that 
a space probe would be flown 
through the comet during the 
1964 approach, when comet and 
earth will pass each other on 
July 12 with a minimum dis- 
tance of about 24 million miles. 
Because of the existence of high 
speed digital computers, quite a 
number of possibilities could be 
investigated. Four of these were 
listed in some detail by the re- 
searchers of the Space Techno- 
logy Laboratories in Los Angeles. 

They are: 

Case 1 . Take-off March 31, tran- 
sit time 108 days, dis- 
tance from earth at time

of penetration 32.2 mil- 
lion miles. The miss 
without mid-course cor- 
rection would be 288,000 
miles, hence fuel for a 
correction of 1500 feet 
per second would be 
needed. The necessary 
fuel would weigh about 
100 pounds if the total 
payload weighs 400 
pounds. 

Case 2. Take-off April 14, tran- 
sit time 92 days, dis- 
tance from earth at time 
of penetration not quite 
29 million miles. The 
miss without mid-course 
correction would be 
195,500 miles. 

Case 3. Take-off April 25, tran- 
sit time 80 days, dis- 
tance from earth at time 
of penetration 26^ mil- 
lion miles. Uncorrected 
miss would be 160,000 
miles. 

Case 4. Take-off February 26, 
transit time 137 days, 
distance from earth at 
time of penetration 
slightly more than 24 



million miles. About 60 
pounds of fuel out of a 
total payload of 320 
pounds would be need- 
ed for the mid-course 
correction. 

The burnout velocity needed 
for these missions would be 40,- 
200 ft. p. sec. for Cast 1, 41,000 
ft. p. for Case 2, 41,800 ft. p. sec. 
for Case 3 and 41,700 ft. p. sec. 
for Case 4. These velocities can 
be produced by existing rockets, 
using the Atlas as the booster 
stage. 

The approach of comet Encke 
in 1967 will be a little less fav- 
orable than the 1964 approach, 
but still within the capability of 
existing rockets, say the Atlas- 
Centaur combination. 

There can hardly be any doubt 
that a mission to a comet (un- 
manned) will be flown before a 
man lands on the moon. 

The space accessible to us 
with the rockets in existence may 
not be very large, but it so hap- 
pens that it contains objects of 
a great range of variety.

HOW

WORLD DIED 



BY HARRY 



C C r T' , ell me how the world end- 
ed, Grandfather, won’t 
you please?” the boy pleaded, 
looking up at the seamed face of 
the old man sitting next to him 
on the trunk of the fallen tree. 

“I’ve told you often enough,” 
the old man said, dozing a bit 
in the warm sun. “I bet you’d 
rather hear about the old trains. 
They used to — ” 

“The world, Grandfather. Tell 
me how it ended, how everything 
went bust.” 

The old man sighed and 
scratched a bit on his thigh, de- 
feated by the obstinacy of the 
very young. “You shouldn’t say 
that it ended, Andy.” 

“That’s what you always 
say.”

“What I always say is that the 
world as we knew it ended. A 
drastic upheaval. Death, destruc- 
tion and chaos, murder, rapine 
and looting.” Andy squirmed 
with happiness on the other end 
of the log. This was always the 
best part. 

“And blood and terror, Grand- 
father, don’t forget that.” 

“It was all of that, too. And 
it was all because of Alexander 
Partagas Scobie, cursed be his 
evil name.” 

“Did you ever meet him, 
Grandfather?” Andy asked, 
knowing all the cues. 

“Yes, I saw Scobie. He passed 
just as close to me as you’re sit- 
ting now, even stopped to talk to 
me. I was polite to him. Polite!

hydraulic press, that’s what I 
should have done.” 

“What’s a hyndraulie press?” 
Grandfather didn’t hear. He 
was by himself now, reliving the 
days before the world ended, the 
days when mankind had been 
supreme upon the earth. 

CtQcobie was mad. They said 
^ so later, when it was too 
late of course, but no one had 
the brains to see it at the time. 
They treated him nice and listen- 
ed to his ideas and tried to talk 
to him, and when he wouldn’t 
listen they just let him go, that’s 
all. Just let him go! Him mad 
as a hatter, with a laboratory 
as big as a mountain and all his 
money in the bank and a pension 
just in case he didn’t have 
enough.” 

“He hated everybody and 
wanted to kill them all, old Sco- 
bie did. Didn’t he, Grandfather?” 
“Wouldn’t be fair to say that.” 
The old man shifted sideways a 
bit to get back into the sun, 
and opened the ragged remains 
of a once fine suit so that he 
could feel the warmth on his 
skin. “I hate Scobie just as 



much as the next man, but fair’s 
fair. They killed him so fast 
when they found out what he 
had done that no one bothered 
to ask him why he had done it. 
Maybe he thought he was doing 
right. Or maybe he liked robots 
more than people. He sure knew 
how to design robots, Scobie did, 
give him credit for that. I re- 
member years before the end 
there were a lot of Scobie robots 
around and people were afraid 
they would take away their jobs 
and stuff like that. They didn’t 
know the half of it. Robots took 
away everything. People were 
always afraid that the robots 
would fight them, turn into mon- 
sters and make war on them. 
Didn’t happen at all like that. 
Scobie made robots that didn’t 
even know people were there.” 

“He made them and turned 
them loose in secret so no one 
would know?” Andy asked 
eagerly. This was the part of the 
story he liked best. 

“Made God knows how many 
and smuggled them out. All over 
the world, in all of the out of the 
way places. Some he dropped off 
near auto junk yards and they 
burrowed under the old cars and 
disappeared. Other ones he put 
down near steel mills where they 
hid under the scrap. They were 
everywheres, in storage dumps 
and warehouses, for months be- 
fore they were discovered, and 



82 



GALAXY 



by that time it was too late. Too 
late by far, there was no stop- 
ping them.” 

“They built each other.” 

C t'Tphcy didn’t build each oth- 
er, that’s not exactly right. 
The ones that Scobie dropped 
were already built. Built fine, 
simple and smart. Programmed 
with a steel tape brain. Pro- 
grammed to do only one 
thing, and that was to build 
other robots just like themselves. 
And when a robot was finished 
building another robot he ac- 
tivated him with a magnetic 
copy of his own brain tape and 
the new robot went to work do- 
ing the same thing. Versatile 
those robots were. Some of them 
were made almost all out of 
aluminum, just dump one of 
them down in a warehouse of 
mothballed airplanes and within 
the week there would be two 
robots, if maybe it could find an 
old tin can to make a steel tape 
out of. Scobie even had one kind 
that had mostly wooden gears 
and burned charcoal to run, and 
■these did fine in the jungles of 
the Amazon and upper Congo. 
They were everywhere you 
could think of, and places you 
would never think of but Scobie 
did, because he was mad. And 
all of the first robots were made 
to be afraid of the light. So they 
scuttled around in the dark and 



no one ever saw them before it 
was too late. By the time peo- 
ple realized what was going on 
there was almost as many robots 
as there were people. A few 
days later there were more ro- 
bots than people and it was the 
end.” 

“But everyone fought them? 
All the guns and tanks and 
everything? Blew the old robots 
up?” 

“By the thousands. But new 
ones were being made by the 
millions. And the tanks ran out 
of ammunition because the fac- 
tories were being taken apart by 
the robots and made into more 
robots, and while the guns in the 
front of a tank were blowing up 
the robots other robots would be 
taking off the back of the tank 
to make more robots. It was hell, 
I tell you. I fought, all of us 
fought, but we couldn’t possibly 
win. Robots didn’t mind getting 
blown up. Blow off the bottom 
of a robot and the top would 
keep on working making anoth- 
er robot. And the other robots 
would stand around watching — 
by this time they weren’t afraid 
of the light any more — pushing 
and eager, ready to grab up the 
broken parts to make more ro- 
bots. In the end we just all gave 
up. There was nothing else we 
could do. Just tried to look after 
ourselves. Just eating and stay- 
ing alive was a job.” 



HOW THE OLD WORLD DIED 



83 



A bit of wind had come up, 
rustling the leaves, the sun had 
dropped out of sight behind the 
trees. Grandfather rose and 
stretched: he didn’t want to 

catch a chill. 

“Better start back,” he said. 

“Then the world was ended?” 
Andy asked, pulling' at the old 
man’s knobby hand, not wanting 
the story to be over. 

“End of the world as I knew 
it, as you’ll never know it. End 
of civilization, end of freedom, 
end of the nobility of men, end 
of his rule as the top creature 
on this planet — the robots rule 
now.” 

“Teacher says they don’t rule, 
they just exist like trees or 
stones, and are just as neutral — 
that’s what teacher said.” 

“What does your teacher 
know?” Grandfather mumbled 
testily. “Young kid, twenty years 
old. I could tell him. The robots 
rule. Mankind has fallen from 
the pinnacle of power.” 

nphey emerged from the woods 
then and the first thing they 
saw was a robot squatting by 
the path, industriously filing 
a gear out of a metal blank. 
Grandfather kicked out in sud- 
den rage and caught the thing 
on its side with a dull metallic 
boom. It had been badly as- 
sembled, or made of inferior ma- 
terial, because when it fell over 



its head came off. Almost before 
it hit the ground there was the 
thud of rushing feet and a flock 
of robots raced by, plucking up 
the head and chasing after the 
rolling gear wheel. There was a 
brief flurry of motion and the 
decapitated robot was dismem- 
bered: the robots hurried off. 

“Andy — !” his mother’s voice 
called from the pleasant cottage 
at the end of the flagstone walk. 

“We’re late for dinner again, I 
bet,” the boy said with sudden 
guilt. He ran quickly up the steps 
that were made of robot bodies 
welded solidly together, and 
grabbed the handle of the door. 
This had been a robot’s hand; 
you just shook hands and turned 
it to open the door. He vanished 
inside. 

Grandfather lingered, not 
wanting to face his daughter’s 
sharp tongue. Not yet. He could 
hear it still echoing in his head 
from the last time. “Don’t fill 
the boy’s head with your iron- 
sense. It’s a good world. Why 
don’t you wear decent clothes 
of robot insulation like the rest 
of us, instead of those awful old 
pre-R smelly things? Robots are 
a national resource — the na- 
tional resource — not the enemy. 
We never had it so good.” On 
and on, the same old record. 

He packed his pipe — made of 
robot fingers — with tobacco 
and sucked it alight. There was 



84 



GALAXY 



the quick sound of running feet 
and a farm wagon ran around 
the corner. Thick boards were 
bolted to the truncated torsos 
of a dozen robots. Just the pelvic 
motors and legs were left of each 
one, and they made a fine form 
of transportation that was com- 
pletely independent of roads. All 
of the truck farmers around the 
village used them now. No ex- 
pense and no upkeep. An un- 
limited supply of free replace- 
ment parts. 



“It is not a utopia the way 
they say!” Grandfather mumbled 
fiercely through a cloud of 
smoke. “Man was meant to work 
and work hard. Shouldn’t have 
everything handed to him so 
easy. They’re using robot parts 
for everything now, a man can’t 
find an honest day’s work even 
if he wants to. 

“End of the world, that’s what 
it was. 

“End of my world!”

HOW THE OLD WORLD DIED

THE 1980 PRESIDENT 



by MIRIAM ALLEN deFORD 

Illustrated by CASTELLON 



Wfio wil! be president in 
1980? And for how long? 



'T''his is a glimpse into the hid- 
den history behind history. 

In August, 1980, Robert John 
Woodruff, Conservative candi- 
date for president of the United 
States, did an utterly unprece- 
dented thing. He consented to 
attend a top-secret, private 
meeting with his opponent, 
Senator Lynn Bartholomew, the 
Liberal candidate. 

Both candidates, like the coun- 
try at large, still felt a little self- 
conscious about the new names 
of their parties, arising from the 
Realignment Act of 1976, the Bi- 
centennial Year. Both also felt 
self-conscious in themselves, for 



obvious reasons, being what they 
personally were. This departure 
from normal protocol, which or- 
dains that rival candidates should 
never meet except for argument 
and controversy, was doubtless 
made possible for both of them 
by their own uniqueness. 

That, and the fact that they 
were meeting at the behest, and 
in the seldom visited Washing- 
ton home, of the Man in Brown. 

The Man in Brown had a 
name, of course. He also had a 
very important and conspicuous 
governmental post, which he had 
held under changing administra- 
tions for twelve years. But he 



86 




Tfffi 1980 PRESIDENT 



87 



was known universally by his 
sobriquet — or sometimes as “the 
Brown Eminence” or “the Man 
of Mystery.” 

In a way he was mysterious, 
and in a way he was not. There 
was no mystery about his rapid 
rise in office. There was no mys- 
tery about his present post as 
head of the Federal agency dedi- 
cated, among other duties, to the 
protection of the president and 
vice-president. But his private 
life and his private past were 
completely unknown. He never 
alluded to them, and all he sub- 
mitted to “Who’s Who” was the 
date of his birth, a history of 
his official connections and his 
address in Washington. People 
said there must be something in 
his past of which he was 
ashamed. But it could do noth- 
ing shameful to himself, or he 
could never have been given his 
appointment. It was as if he had 
appeared, full-blown, about fif- 
teen years earlier, and had nev- 
er existed before then. 

About his power there was no 
question. He did not issue any 
commands or give any orders. 
He was not authorized to do so. 
He merely assembled small 
groups of those who really ran 
things in each party. After he 
had talked to them they either 
followed his advice or were sorry 
they hadn’t. 

He was spare, not very tall, 



with thinning brown hair, mild 
hazel eyes and a quiet voice. His 
trademark and his only eccen- 
tricity was that he dressed al- 
ways in brown, down to tan 
shirts and dark brown ties and 
shoes. Hence his nickname. 

CCA/f y friends,” he said on this 
August morning, with 
the air-conditioning screening off 
the oppressive heat, and with his 
guests settled in comfortable 
Figurmold chairs and supplied 
with glasses beaded with mois- 
ture and with the Inhalepruf 
Smokesafes that everybody had 
finally come to using, “no doubt 
you have been racking your 
brains on your way here — you, 
Mr. Woodruff, from your Foun- 
dation chairmanship in Califor- 
nia, and you, Senator, from your 
constituency in Alaska — to try 
to find some explanation for my 
asking you to this joint meeting. 
It was good of you both to make 
the trip without insisting first 
on knowing why.” 

Senator Bartholomew smiled 
and said: “We learned long ago 
in the Senate that if the Man in 
Brown wants to see us, he has a 
very good reason.” Woodruff 
cleared his throat and added : 
“We’ve learned that outside of 
the Senate, too.” 

“That’s far too kind,” said 
their host suavely. “But this time 
it happens to be true.

“What I want to say to you 
both, in the presence of each 
other, can be put in very few 
words. Whichever of you wins in 
November will probably die 
soon.” 

“You mean, because I am — ” 

The two voices rose in unison 
and broke short in common em- 
barrassment. 

The Man in Brown looked at 
them quizzically. 

“Because of your age? — no, 
not because of that,” he said. 
“Though that was the real rea- 
son why both of you, though na- 
turally you were both highly 
qualified otherwise, were nomin- 
ated so easily on the first ballot 
— and also the reason that both 
your vice-presidential candidates 
are such outstanding figures. 

“What I mean is — Let me say 
first that I attended both con- 
ventions.” 

“I didn’t see you,” said Wood- 
ruff bluntly. 

“Nobody saw me. Except the 
few people I talked to there.” 

“The wheels behind the 
wheels,” inquired the Senator, 
with a touch of cynicism gained 
from years of public life. 

“You might call them so. I 
told them what I am now going 
to tell you. In consequence, you 
two were nominated. But I also 
told them that I was not going 
to let either of you go blindfold- 
ed into danger.” 



“I’m used to danger,” said 
Woodruff curtly. 

“Not this sort. Be patient with 
me a little longer. I’ll try to 
make things a bit clearer. 

“I want to remind you of a 
strange phenomenon in Ameri- 
can history. It is no secret — it 
has been published many times. 
It will be talked about through- 
out this campaign. I believe it is 
time to take it seriously. 

“In 1840 William Henry Har- 
rison was elected president. He 
died in office two months later. 
In 1860 Abraham Lincoln was 
elected ; he was assassinated — 
not in his first term, but while in 
office. In 1880 James A. Gar- 
field was elected; he was assas- 
sinated the following year. In 
1900 the same sequence applied 
to William McKinley. In 1920 
Warren G. Harding was elected; 
he died in office. In 1940 Frank- 
lin Delano Roosevelt was elected 
to his third term; he died in of- 
fice during his fourth term. In 
1960 John F. Kennedy was elect- 
ed; he was assassinated before 
the end of his third year. 

“Every twenty years, for 140 
years now, the successful candi- 
date for president of the United 
States has either been killed or 
has died of natural causes while 
in office. 

“This is 1980.” 

There was a tense silence. 
Then Senator Bartholomew, very 



THE 1980 PRESIDENT 



89 



pale, murmured: “Other presi- 
dents have died in office.” 

“Only Zachary Taylor. And 
I’m not saying what has happen- 
ed on other dates. I’m only re- 
marking on what is associated 
with these dates.” 

Woodruff avoided his host’s 
gaze. The Man in Brown smiled 
again. 

“I know what you are think- 
ing, Mr. Woodruff,” he said 
calmly. “What both of you are 
thinking : coincidence, supersti- 
tion. But have I a reputation for 
irrationality? 

“I can’t tell you why this has 
happened. Perhaps there is no 
reason, in any terms in which we 
can define reason. All I am point- 
ing out is that it has happened 
every twenty years since 1840, 
and that it is now twenty years 
since 1960.” 

“They should have told us be- 
fore the vote was taken,” Wood- 
ruff muttered. “Your lot too,” he 
softly added to Senator Barthol- 
omew. 

“I know. I tried to get both 
conventions to agree to that,” the 
Man in Brown said regretfully. 
“They refused. They were afraid 
nobody would be willing to run. 
It took all kinds of effort to get 
as much done as — ” 

“I see.” Woodruff’s tone was 
bitter. “I should have guessed. 
My campaign manager was the 
most surprised man at the con- 



vention — I was the darkest of 
dark horses, and I could scarce- 
ly believe my ears when I heard 
the votes on the first ballot. And 
when the man who had been the 
likeliest of all was nominated in- 
stead for the position of vice pres- 
idency — 

“I’m a fool. My wife and my 
children will thank you for this!” 

Senator Bartholomew, who was 
unmarried, nodded sympathe- 
tically. 

The Man in Brown stood up 
and began to pace the floor of 
his austerely furnished living- 
room. He stopped abruptly and 
laid his hand on Woodruff’s 
shaking shoulder. 

“All this being so,” he said, 
“are you still willing to serve?” 

The Conservative candidate 
lifted his head. His dark eyes 
were somber. 

“Of course,” he answered. “My 
followers believe in me and the 
ideals I espouse.” 

“And I, for the same reason,” 
said the Senator proudly. 

The Man in Brown sighed in 
relief. 

“That’s what I’ve been wait- 
ing for you both to say. You’re 
not just ambitious politicians, 
either of you; you’re people with 
a cause — with two causes. 

“All right. Now that’s settled, 
let’s see if there isn’t some way 
by which we can manage to lift 
this curse.”

EDITORIAL FROM THE WASHINGTON 
NEWS-POST-STAR, SEPTEMBER 4, 1980 
This paper is not going to endorse 
either candidate for president this year. 

It is only 17 years since we Washing- 
tonians had any vote at all, and we are 
not going to use it to condemn a fel- 
low-being to death. Our advice to vot- 
ers would be to stay home on the first 
Tuesday after the first Monday in 
November — or to vote only for other 
candidates than president. 

Every citizen of the United States 
must know by now what is likely to 
happen to the candidate successful in 
1980. We are not sure whether it was 
wise to give this matter such wide 
publicity, but that was the advice of 
high Federal officials. We, like every 
other communications medium have 
obeyed. 

There seems to be no way in which 
this crisis could have been averted. 
We couldn't change the presidential 
election year, or the length of the presi- 
dential term, because either would in- 
volve an amendment to the Constitu- 
tion, which would require passage by 
two thirds of both Houses and ratifica- 
tion bv tv'o thirds of the States; and the 
1980 election is now onlv two months 
away. The present incumbent couldn't 
be renominated and re-elected — even 
if he had been willing to take the 
risk — because the twenty-second 
amendment has not been repealed, and 
our oresident is now concluding his 
second term. We can't repeal that 
amendment in time, either. 

So this paper has no endorsement ta 
make for the presidency. We do have 
somethin*-* to sen/ about the viee-nrest- 
denev. Both candidates are probably 
the mn«t carefully selected and the most 
outstanding representatives of thefr 
p"'*-. in American history. But In our 
opinion . 

Tt was the strangest of all elec- 
tions. Millions abstained from 
voting at all, and too many voted 
for a president they did not 
want, in the hope that their bal- 



lots might constitute a weapon 
of indirect murder. For the sec- 
ond time in our history neither 
candidate received a plurality. 
The election was thrown into the 
House of Representatives. 

Then the Man in Brown ap- 
peared again. He consulted with 
a selected group of Congressmen, 
and suggested to them a brilliant 
maneuver. By means of every 
possible legislative strategem, in- 
cluding the filibuster with no 
votes at all for cloture, the House 
delayed decision until 1980 was 
over. Their choice was announ- 
ced the morning after the incum- 
bent’s term expired. 

The new president (every 
American knows now which one 
it was, and how good a president 
the successful candidate became) 
had thus been elected in 1981. 

Both Robert John Woodruff 
and Lynn Bartholomew, as we 
know, are alive and usefully ac- 
tive today. 

But it had taken the Crisis of 
1980 to induce the two major 
parties to nominate respectively 
a Negro foundation head and a 
Senator who happened to be a 
woman. 

The weird fatality of the twen- 
ty year periods will never menace 
a United States president again. 
In 1985, the twenty - eighth 
amendment to the Constitu- 
tion was passed and ratified. 
All presidential elections are now 



THE 1980 PRESIDENT 



91 



held in years ending with an odd 
number, indivisible by 20. Of 
course a president may still die 
in office — but no longer by that 
inexplicable periodicity. Now, as 
we approach the end of the 
twentieth century, we look for- 
ward without trepidation to the 
election of 2001. 

And some commentators have 
wondered if perhaps that repeat- 
ed doom may not somehow have 
been planned — may not have 
had a meaning: the ending of 
deep-seated preconceptions, the 
final realization that human be- 
ings may be segregated by in- 
tellect or personality, but never 
by race or ancestry or sex. 

Tn 1982, the Man in Brown 
(brown was a sacred color in 
his birthplace) reported to his 
superiors that the method had 
worked, the result was sure and 
his task was done. He urgently 



requested permission to retire at 
last and return home. His retire- 
ment took place after due notice, 
against all pleadings from the 
Administration to reconsider, and 
he promptly disappeared. No 
one on earth has seen or heard 
of him since. 

The reason is simple. The 
superiors to whom he made his 
first, and activating, application 
were not on earth. On a planet 
of another solar system he had 
been trained and prepared, and 
sent here to carry out the mis- 
sion he had so ably performed. 

With bigotry abolished in one 
great nation — and who knows 
what other missionaries are not 
at work in all civilized lands? — 
Earth is now one step nearer to 
eligibility for membership in the 
great Galactic Federation whose 
member-planets it will so soon 
be visiting.

The first prerequisite of a good 
government is that it works. The 
second — it mustn't work too well l 



I 

tCTJetter men than you have 
tried!” snarled Clinton 

Watt. 

“I quote paragraph four, sec- 
tion ninety-one of the Semantic 



Revision to the Constitution," 
said saboteur extraordinary Jorj 
X. McKie. “ ‘The need for ob- 
structive processes in govern- 
ment having been established as 
one of the chief safeguards for 
human rights, the question of im- 



93 



munities must be defined with 
extreme precision.’ ” 

McKie sat across a glistening 
desk from the Intergalactic Gov- 
ernment’s Secretary of Sabotage, 
Clinton Watt. An air of tension 
filled the green-walled office, 
carrying over into the screenview 
behind Watt which showed an 
expanse of the System Govern- 
ment’s compound and people 
scurrying about their morning 
business with a sense of urgency. 

Watt, a small man who ap- 
peared to crackle with suppress- 
ed energy, passed a hand across 
his shaven head. “All right,” he 
said in a suddenly tired voice. 
“This is the only Secretariat of 
government that’s never immune 
from sabotage. You’ve satisfied 
the legalities by quoting the law. 
Now, do your damnedest!” 
McKie, whose bulk and fat 
features usually gave him the 
appearance of a grandfatherly 
toad, glowered like a gnome- 
dragon. His mane of red hair ap- 
peared to dance with inner flame. 

“Damnedest!” he snapped. 
“You think I came in here to try 
to unseat you? You think that?” 
And McKie thought: Let's 

hope he thinks that! 

“Stop the act, McKie!” Watt 
said. “We both know you’re elig- 
ible for this chair.” He patted 
the arm of his chair. “And we 
both know the only way you can 
eliminate me and qualify your- 



self for the appointment is to 
overcome me with a masterful 
sabotage. Well, McKie, I’ve sat 
here more than eighteen years. 
Another five months and it’ll be 
a new record. Do your damned- 
est. I’m waiting.” 

“I came in here for only one 
reason,” McKie said. “I want to 
report on the search for sabo- 
teur extraordinary Napoleon Bil- 
doon.” 

McKie sat back wondering: It 
Watt knew my real purpose here 
would he act just this way? Per- 
haps. The man had been behav- 
ing oddly since the start of this 
interview, but it was difficult to 
determine real motive when deal- 
ing with a fellow member of the 
Bureau of Sabotage. 

C autious interest quickened 
Watt’s bony face. He wet his 
lips with his tongue and it was 
obvious he was asking himself 
if this were more of an elaborate 
ruse. But McKie had been as- 
signed the task of searching for 
the missing agent, Bildoon, and 
it was just possible . 

“Have you found him?” Watt 
asked. 

“I’m not sure,” McKie said. 
He ran his fingers through his 
red hair. “Bildoon’s a Pan- 
Spechi, you know.” 

“For disruption’s sake!” Watt 
exploded. “I know who and what 
my own agents are! But we take 



94 



GALAXY 



care of our own. And when one 
of our best people just drops 
from sight . What’s this about 
not being sure?” 

“The Pan-Spechi are a curious 
race of creatures,” McKie said. 
“Just because they’ve taken on 
humanoid shape we tend to for- 
get their five-phase life cycle.” 

“Bildoon told me himself he’d 
hold his group’s ego at least an- 
other ten years,” Watt said. “I 
think he was being truthful, 
but . .” Watt shrugged and some 
of the bursting energy seemed to 
leave him. “Well, the group 
ego’s the only place where the 
Pan-Spechi show vanity, so . 
Again he shrugged. 

“My questioning of the other 
Pan-Spechi in the Bureau has 
had to be circumspect, of 
course,” McKie said. “But I did 
follow one lead clear to Achus.” 

“And?” 

McKie brought a white vial 
from his copious jacket, scatter- 
ed a metallic powder on the 
desktop. 

Watt pushed himself back 
from the desk, eyeing the pow- 
der with suspicion. He took a 
cautious sniff, smelled chalf, the 
quick-scribe powder. Still . 

“It’s just chalf,” McKie said. 
And he thought: It he buys that, 
I may get away with this. 

“So scribe it,” Watt said. 

Concealing his elation, McKie 
held a chalf-memory stick over 



the dusted surface. A broken cir- 
cle with arrows pointing to a 
right-hand flow appeared in the 
chalf. At each break in the cir- 
cle stood a symbol — in one 
place the Pan-Spechi character 
for ego, then the delta for fifth 
gender and, finally, the three 
lines that signified the dormant 
creche-triplets. 

McKie pointed to the fifth 
gender delta. “I’ve seen a Pan- 
Spechi in this position who looks 
a bit like Bildoon and appears 
to have some of his mannerisms. 
There’s no identity response 
from the creature, of course. 
Well, you know how the quasi- 
feminine fifth gender reacts.” 
“Don’t ever let that amorous 
attitude fool you,” Watt warned. 
“In spite of your nasty disposi- 
tion I wouldn’t want to lose you 
into a Pan-Spechi creche.” 
“Bildoon wouldn’t rob a fel- 
low agent’s identity,” McKie 
said. He pulled at his lower lip, 
feeling an abrupt uncertainty. 
Here, of course, was the most 
touchy part of the whole scheme. 
“If it was Bildoon.” 

“Did you meet this group’s 
ego holder?” Watt asked and his 
voice betrayed real interest. 

“No,” McKie said. “But I 
think the ego-single of this Pan- 
Spechi is involved with the Tax 
Watchers.” 

McKie waited, wondering if 
Watt would rise to the bait. 



96 



GALAXY 



“I’ve never heard of an ego 
change being forced onto a Pan- 
Spechi,” Watt said in a musing 
tone, “but that doesn’t mean it’s 
impossible. If those Tax Watch- 
er do gooders found Bildoon sa- 
botaging their efforts and . 
Hmmm.” 

“Then Bildoon was after the 
Tax Watchers,” McKie said. 

T X/att scowled. McKie’s ques- 
’ ’ tion was in extreme bad 
taste. Senior agents, unless join- 
ed on a project or where the in- 
formation was volunteered, didn’t 
snoop openly into the work of 
their fellows. Left hand and right 
hand remained mutually ignorant 
in the Bureau of Sabotage and 
for good reason. Unless . Watt 
stared speculatively at his sabo- 
teur extraordinary. 

McKie shrugged as Watt re- 
mained silent. “I can’t operate 
on inadequate information,” he 
said. “I must, therefore, resign 
the assignment to search for 
Bildoon. Instead, I will now look 
into the Tax Watchers.” 

“You will not!” Watt snapped. 
McKie forced himself not to 
look at the design he had drawn 
on the desktop. The next few 
moments were the critical ones. 

“You’d better have a legal rea- 
son for that refusal,” McKie 
said. 

Watt swiveled sideways in his 
chair, glanced at the screenview, 



then addressed himself to the 
side wall. “The situation has be- 
come one of extreme delicacy, 
Jorj. It’s well known that you’re 
one of our finest saboteurs.” 

“Save your oil for someone 
who needs it,” McKie growled. 

“Then I’ll put it this way,” 
Watt said, returning his gaze to 
McKie. “The Tax Watchers in 
the last few days have posed a 
real threat to the Bureau. 
They’ve managed to convinced a 
High Court magistrate they de- 
serve the same immunity from 
our ministrations that a . well, 
public water works or . ah . 
food processing plant might en- 
joy. The magistrate, Judge Ed- 
win Dooley, invoked the Public 
Safety amendment. Our hands 
are tied. The slightest suspicion 
that we’ve disobeyed the injunc- 
tion and . 

Watt drew a finger across his 
throat. 

“Then I quit,” McKie said. 

“You’ll do nothing of the 
kind!” 

“This TW outfit is trying to 
eliminate the Bureau, isn’t it?” 
McKie asked. “I remember the 
oath I took just as well as you 
do.” 

“Jorj, you couldn’t be that 
much of a simpleton,” Watt said. 
“You quit, thinking that absolves 
the Bureau from responsibility 
for you! That trick’s as old as 

timer 



THE TACTFU1 SABOTEUR

“Then fire me!” McKie said. 

“I’ve no legal reason to fire 
you Jorj.” 

“Refusal to obey orders of a 
superior,” McKie said. 

“It wouldn’t fool anybody, you 
dolt!” ' 

McKie appeared to hesitate, 
said: “Well, the public doesn’t 
know the inner machinery of how 
we change the Bureau’s com- 
mand. Perhaps it’s time we open- 
ed up.” 

“Jorj, before I could fire you 
there’d have to be a reason so 
convincing that . Just forget 
it.” 

'T'he fat pouches beneath Mc- 
Kie’s eyes lifted until the 
eyes were mere slits. The crucial 
few moments had arrived. He 
had managed to smuggle a Jicuz- 
zi stim into this office past all 
of Watt’s detectors, concealing 
the thing’s detectable radiation 
core within an imitation of the 
lapel badge that Bureau agents 
wore. 

“In Lieu of Red Tape,” Mc- 
Kie said and touched the badge 
with a finger, feeling the raised 
letters there — “ILRT.” The 
touch focused the radiation core 
onto the metallic dust scattered 
over the desktop. 

Watt gripped the arms of the 
chair, studying McKie with a 
new look of wary tension. 

“We are under legal injunc- 



tion to keep hands off the Tax 
Watchers,” Watt said. “Anything 
that happens to those people or 
to their project for scuttling us 
— even legitimate accidents — 
will be laid at our door. We must 
be able to defend ourselves. No 
one who has ever been connected 
with us dares fall under the 
slightest suspicion of complicity.” 

“How about a floor waxed to 
dangerous slickness in the path 
of one of their messengers? How 
about a doorlock changed to de- 
lay — ” 

“Nothing.” 

McKie stared at his chief. 
Everything depended now on the 
man holding very still. He knew 
Watt wore detectors to warn him 
of concentrated beams of radi- 
ation. But this Jicuzzi stim had 
been rigged to diffuse its charge 
off the metallic dust on the desk 
and that required several sec- 
onds of relative quiet. 

The men held themselves 
rigid in the staredown until Watt 
began to wonder at the extreme 
stillness of McKie’s body. The 
man was even holding his 
breath ! 

McKie took a deep breath, 
stood up. 

“I warn you, Jorj,” Watt said. 

“Warn me?” 

“I can restrain you by physi- 
cal means if necessary.” 

“Clint, old enemy, save your 
breath. What’s done is done.” 



98 



GALAXY 



A smile touched McKie’s wide 
mouth. He turned, crossed to the 
room’s only door, paused there, 
hand on knob. 

“What have you done?” Watt 
exploded. 

McKie continued to look at 
him. 

Watt’s scalp began itching 
madly. He put a hand there, felt 
a long tangle of . tendrils! 
They were lengthening under 
his fingers, growing out of his 
scalp, waving and writhing. 

“A Jicuzzi stim,” Watt breath- 
ed. 

McKie let himself out, closed 
the door. 

Watt leaped out of his chair, 
raced to the door. 

Locked! 

He knew McKie and didn’t 
try unlocking it. Frantically, 
Watt slapped a molecular disper- 
sion wad against the door, dived 
through as the wad blasted. He 
landed in the outer hall, stared 
first one direction, then the oth- 
er. 

The hall was empty. 

T 7"att sighed. The tendrils had 
’ ’ stopped growing, but they 
were long enough now that he 
could see them writhing past his 
eyes — a rainbow mass of wrig- 
glers. part of himself. And Mc- 
Kie will) the original stim was 
the only one who could reverse 
the process — unless Watt were 



willing to spend an interminable 
time with the Jicuzzi themselves. 
No. That was out of the ques- 
tion. 

Watt began assessing his posi- 
tion. 

The stim tendrils couldn’t be 
removed surgically, couldn’t be 
tied down or contained in any 
kind of disguise without endan- 
gering the person afflicted with 
them. Their presence would 
hamper him, too, during this cri- 
tical time of trouble with the 
Tax Watchers. How could he ap- 
pear in conferences and inter- 
views with these things writhing 
in their Medusa dance on his 
head? It would be laughable! 
He’d be an object of comedy. 

And if McKie could stay out 
of the way until a Case of Ex- 
changement was brought before 
the full Cabinet . But, no! 
Watt shook his head. This wasn’t 
the kind of sabotage that requir- 
ed a change of command in the 
Bureau. This was a gross thing. 
No subtlety to it. This was like ss 
practical joke. Clownish. 

But McKie was noted for his 
clownish attitude, his irreverence 
for all the blundering self-impor- 
tance of government. 

Have I been self-important? 
Watt wondered. 

In all honesty, he had to ad- 
mit it. 

I’ll have to submit my resig- 
nation today, he thought. Right

after I fire McKie. One look at 
me and there’ll be no doubt of 
why I did it. This is about aa 
convincing a reason as you Could 
find. 

Watt turned to his right, head- 
ed for the lab to see if they could 
help him bring this wriggling 
mass under control. 

The President will want me to 
stay at the helm until McKie 
makes his next move, Watt 
thought. I have to be able to 
function somehow.

TV /TcKie waited in the living 
room of the Achusian man- 
sion with ill concealed unease. 
Achus was the administrative 
planet for the Vulpecula region, 
an area of great wealth, and this 
room high on a mountaintop 
commanded a natural view to the 
southwest across lesser peaks and 
foothills misted in purple by a 
westering G 3 sun. 

But McKie ignored the view, 
trying to watch all corners of 
the room at once. He had seen 
a fifth gender Pan-Spechi here 
in company with the fourth-gen- 
der ego-holder. That could only 
mean the creche with its three 
dormants was nearby. By all ac- 
counts, this was a dangerous 
place for someone not protected 
by bonds of friendship and com- 
munity of interest. 



The value of the Pan-Spechi 
to the universal human society 
in which they participated was 
beyond question. What other 
species had such refined finesse 
in deciding when to hinder and 
when to help? Who else could 
send a key member of its group 
into circumstances of extreme 
peril without fear that the en- 
dangered one’s knowledge would 
be lost? 

There was always a dormant 
to take up where the lost one 
had left off. 

Still, the Pan-Spechi did have 
their idiosyncrasies. And their 
hungers were at times bizarre. 

“Ahh, McKie.” 

The voice, deep and masculine, 
came from his left McKie whirl- 
ed to study the figure that came 
through a door carved from a 
single artificial emerald of glit- 
tering creme de menthe colors. 

The speaker was humanoid but 
with Pan-Spechi multi-faceted 
eyes. He appeared to be a ter- 
ranic man (except for the blue- 
green eyes) of an indeterminate, 
well-preserved middle age. The 
body suggested a certain dain- 
tiness in its yellow tights and 
singlet. The head was squared 
in outline with close-cropped 
blond hair, a fleshy chunk of 
nose and thick splash of mouth. 

“Panthor Bolin here,” the 
Pan-Spechi said. “You are wel- 
come in my home, Jorj McKie.” 



100 



GALAXY 



McKie relaxed slightly. Pan- 
Spechi were noted for honoring 
hospitality once it was extended 
. provided the guest didn’t 
violate their mores. 

“I’m honored that you’ve 
agreed to see me,” McKie said. 

“The honor is mine,” Bolin 
said. “We’ve long recognized 
you as a person whose under- 
standing of the Pan-Spechi is 
most subtle and penetrating. I’ve 
longed for the chance to have 
uninhibited conversation with 
you. And here you are.” He in- 
dicated a chairdog against the 
wall to his right, snapped his 
fingers. The semi-sentient arti- 
fact glided to a position behind 
McKie. “Please be seated.” 

McKie, his caution re-alerted 
by Bolin’s reference to “unin- 
hibited conversation,” sank into 
the chairdog, patting it until it 
assumed the contours he wanted. 

Bolin took a chairdog facing 
him, leaving only about a meter 
separating their knees. 

UTI ave our egos shared near- 
-^ness before?” McKie ask- 
ed. “You appeared to recognize 

_ »» 
me. 

“Recognition goes deeper than 
ego,” Bolin said. “Do you wish 
to join identities and explore 
this question?” 

McKie wet his lips with his 
tongue. This was delicate ground 
with the Pan-Spechi, whose one 



ego moved somehow from mem- 
ber to member of the unit group 
as they traversed their circle oi 
being. 

“I . ah . not at this time,” 
McKie said. 

“Well spoken,” Bolin said. 
“Should you ever change your 
mind, my ego-group would con- 
sider it a most signal honor. 
Yours is a strong identity, one 
we respect.” 

“I’m . most honored,” Mc- 
Kie said. He rubbed nervously 
at his jaw, recognizing the dan- 
gers in this conversation. Each 
Pan-Spechi group maintained a 
supremely jealous attitude of and 
about its wandering ego. The ego 
imbued the holder of it with a 
touchy sense of honor. Inquiries 
about it could be carried out 
only through such formula ques- 
tions as McKie already had ask- 
ed. 

Still, if this were a member of 
the pent-archal life circle con- 
taining the missing saboteur ex- 
traordinary Napoleon Bildoon 
... if it were, much would be 
explained. 

“You’re wondering if we really 
can communicate,” Bolin said. 
McKie nodded. 

“The concept of humanity,” 
Bolin said, “ — our term for it 
would translate approximately 
as com-sentiency — has been ex- 
tended to encompass many dif- 
fering shapes, life systems and

methods of mentation. And yet 
we have never been sure about 
this question. It’s one of the ma- 
jor reasons many of us have 
adopted your life-shape and 
much of your metabolism. We 
wished to experience your 
strengths and your weaknesses. 
This helps . but is not an ab- 
solute solution.” 

“Weaknesses?” McKie asked, 
suddenly wary. 

“Ahhh-hummm,” Bolin said. 
“I see. To allay your suspicions 
I will have translated for you 
soon one of our major works. Its 
title would be, approximately, 
The Developmental Influence of 
Weaknesses. One of the strong- 
est sympathetic bonds we have 
with your species, for example, 
is the fact that we both origi- 
nated as extremely vulnerable 
surface-bound creatures, whose 
most sophisticated defense came 
to be the social structure.” 

“I’ll be most interested to see 
the translation,” McKie said. 

“Do you wish more amenities 
or do you care to state your busi- 
ness now?” Bolin asked. 

“I was . ah . assigned to 
seek out a missing agent of our 
Bureau,” McKie said, “to be cer- 
tain no harm had befallen this 
. ah . agent.” 

“Your avoidance of gender is 
most refined,” Bolin said. “I ap- 
preciate the delicacy of your 
position and your good taste. I 



will say this for now: the Pan- 
Spechi you seek is not at this 
time in need of your assistance. 
Your concern, however, is ap- 
preciated. It will be communi- 
cated to those upon whom it will 
have the most influence.” 

“That’s a great relief to me,” 
McKie said. And he wondered: 
What did he really mean by 
that? This thought elicited an- 
other, and McKie said: “When- 
ever I run into this problem of 
communication between species 
I’m reminded of an old culture/ 
teaching story.” 

“Oh?” Bolin registered polite 
curiosity. 

“Two practitioners of the art 
of mental healing, so the story 
goes, passed each other every 
morning on their way to their re- 
spective offices. They knew each 
other, but weren’t on intimate 
terms. One morning as they ap- 
proached each other, one of them 
turned to the other and said, 
‘Good morning.’ The one greeted 
failed to respond, but continued 
toward his office. Presently, 
though, he stopped, turned and 
stared at the retreating back of 
the man who’d spoken, musing 
to himself: ‘Now, what did he 
really mean by that?’ ” 

Tjolin began to chuckle, then 
laugh. His laughter grew 
louder and louder until he was 
holding his sides. 



102 



GALAXY 



It wasn’t that funny, McKie 
thought. 

Bolin’s laughter subsided. “A 
very educational story,” he said. 
“I’m deeply indebted to you. 
This story shows your aware- 
ness of how important it is in 
communication that we be aware 
of the other's identity.” 

Does it? McKie wondered. 
How’s that? 

And McKie found himself 
caught up by his knowledge of 
how the Pan-Spechi could pass 
a single ego-identity from in- 
dividual to individual within the 
life circle group of five distinct 
protoplasmic units. He wondered 
how it felt when the ego-holder 
gave up the identity to become 
the fifth gender, passing the ego 
spark to a newly matured unit 
from the creche. Did the fifth 
gender willingly become creche 
nurse and give itself up as a 
mysterious identity-food for the 
three dormants in the creche? he 
wondered. 

“I heard about what you did to 
Secretary of Sabotage Clinton 
Watt,” Bolin said. “The story of 
your dismissal from the service 
preceded you here.” 

“Yes,” McKie said. “That’s 
why I’m here, too.” 

“You’ve penetrated to the fact 
that our Pan-Spechi community 
here on Achus is the heart of 
the Tax Watchers’ orangization,” 
Bolin said. “It was very brave 



of you to walk right into our 
hands. I understand how much 
more courage it takes for your 
kind to face unit extinction than 
it does for our kind. Admirable! 
You are indeed a prize.” 

McKie fought down a sensa- 
tion of panic, reminding himself 
that the records he had left in his 
private locker of Bureau head- 
quarters could be deciphered in 
time even if he did not return. 

“Yes,” Bolin said, “you wish 
to satisfy yourself that the ascen- 
sion of a Pan-Spechi to the head 
of your Bureau will pose no 
threat to other human species. 
This is understandable.” 

McKie shook his head to clear 
it. “Do you read minds?” he de- 
manded. 

“Telepathy is not one of our 
accomplishments,” Bolin said, his 
voice heavy with menace. “I 
do hope that was a generalized 
question and in no way directed 
at the intimacies of my ego- 
group.” 

“I felt that you were reading 
my mind,” McKie said, tensing 
himself for defense. 

4 1 Hphat was how I interpreted 
-*■ the question,” Bolin said. 
“Forgive my question. I should 
not have doubted your delicacy 
or your tact.” 

“You do hope to place a mem- 
ber in the job of Bureau Secre- 
tary, though?” McKie said. 



THE TACTFUL SABOTEUR 



103 



“Remarkable that you 
should’ve suspected it,” Bolin 
said. “How can you be sure our 
intention is not merely to des- 
troy the Bureau?” 

“I’m not.” McKie glanced 
around the room, regretting that 
he had been forced to act alone. 

“Where did we give ourselves 
away?’ Bolin mused. 

“Let me remind you,” McKie 
said, “that I have accepted the 
hospitality you offered and that 
I’ve not offended your mores.” 
“Most remarkable,” Bolin said. 
“In spite of all the temptations 
I offered, you have not offended 
our mores. This is true. You are 
an embarrassment, indeed you 
are. But perhaps you have a wea- 
pon. Yes?” 

McKie lifted a wavering shape 
from an inner pocket. 

“Ahhh, the Jicuzzi stim,” Bo- 
lin said. “Now, let me see, is 
that a weapon?” 

McKie held the shape on his 
palm. It appeared flat at first, 
like a palm-sized sheet of pink 
paper. Gradually, the flatness 
grew a superimposed image of a 
tube laid on its surface, then an- 
other image of an S-curved 
spring that coiled and wound 
around the tube. 

“Our species can control its 
shape to some extent,” Bolin said. 
“There’s some question on 
whether I can consider this a 
weapon.” 



McKie curled his fingers 
around the shape, squeezed. 
There came a pop, and fumero- 
les of purple light emerged be- 
tween his fingers accompanied 
by an odor of burnt sugar. 

“Exit stim,” McKie said. 
“Now I’m completely defense- 
less, entirely dependent upon 
your hospitality.” 

“Ah, you are a tricky one,” 
Bolin said. “But have you no re- 
gard for Ser Clinton Watt? To 
him, the change you forced upon 
him is an affliction. You've des- 
troyed the instrument that might 
have reversed the process.” 

“He can apply to the Jicuzzi,” 
McKie said, wondering why Bo- 
lin should concern himself over 
Watt. 

“Ah, but they will ask your 
permission to intervene,” Bolin 
said. “They are so formal. Draft- 
ing their request should take at 
least three standard years. They 
will not take the slightest chance 
of offending you. And you, of 
course, cannot volunteer your 
permission without offending 
them. You know, they may even 
build a nerve-image of you upon 
which to test their petition. You 
are not a callous person, McKie, 
in spite of you clownish poses. 
I’d not realized how important 
this confrontation was to you.” 

GtOince I’m completely at your 
mercy,” McKie said.

“would you try to stop me from 

leaving here?” 

“An interesting question,” Bo- 
lin said. “You have information 
I don’t want revealed at this 
time. You’re aware of this, na- 
turally?” 

“Naturally.” 

“I find the constitution a 
most wonderful document,” Bo- 
lin said. “The profound aware- 
ness of the individual’s identity 
and its relationship to society as 
a whole. Of particular interest is 
the portion dealing with the 
Bureau of Sabotage, those 
amendments recognizing that the 
Bureau itself might at times 
need . ah . adjustment.” 

Now what’s he driving at? Mc- 
Kie wondered. And he noted how 
Bolin squinted his eyes in 
thought, leaving only a thin line 
of faceted glitter. 

“I shall speak now as chief 
officer of the Tax Watchers,” 
Bolin said, “reminding you that 
we are legally immune from sa- 
botage.” 

I’ve found out what I wanted 
to know, McKie thought. Now 
if I can only get out of here with 
it! 

“Let us consider the training 
of saboteurs extraordinary,” Bo- 
lin said. “What do the trainees 
learn about the make-work and 
featherbedding elements in Bu- 
reau activity?” 

He’s not going to trap me in a 



lie, McKie thought. “We come 
right out and tell our trainees 
that one of our chief functions is 
to create jobs for the politicians 
to fill,” he said. “The more hands 
in the pie, the slower the mix- 
ing.” 

“You’ve heard that telling a 
falsehood to your host is a great 
breach of Pan-Spechi mores, I 
see,” Bolin said. “You under- 
stand, of course, that refusal to 
answer certain questions is inter- 
preted as a falsehood?” 

“So I’ve been told,” McKie 
said. 

“Wonderful! And what are 
your trainees told about the foot 
dragging and the monkeywrench- 
es you throw into the path of 
legislation?” 

“I quote from the pertinent 
training brochure,” McKie said. 
“ ‘A major function of the Bu- 
reau is to slow passage of legisla- 
tion.’ ” 

“Magnificent! And what about 
the disputes and outright bat- 
tles Bureau agents have been 
known to incite?” 

“Strictly routine,” McKie said. 
“We’re duty bound to encourage 
the growth of anger in govern- 
ment wherever we can. It ex- 
poses the temperamental types, 
the ones who can’t control them- 
selves, who can’t think on their 
feet.” 

“Ah,” Bolin said. “How enter- 
taining.” 



THE TACTFUL SABOTEUR

“We beep entertainment value 
in mind,” McKie admitted. “We 
use drama and flamboyance 
wherever possible to keep our ac- 
tivities fascinating to the public.” 
“Flamboyant obstructionism,” 
Bolin mused. 

“Obstruction is a factor in 
strength,” McKie said. “Only 
the strongest surmount the ob- 
structions to succeed in govern- 
ment. The strongest ... or the 
most devious, which is more or 
less the same thing when it comes 
to government.” 

1 4 J T ow illuminating,” Bolin 
-“-said. He rubbed the backs 
of his hands, a Pan-Spechi man- 
nerism denoting satisfaction. “Do 
you have special instructions re- 
garding political parties?” 

“We stir up dissent between 
them,” McKie said. “Opposition 
tends to expose reality, that’s 
one of our axioms.” 

“Would you characterize Bu- 
reau agents as troublemakers?” 
“Of course! My parents were 
happy as the devil when I show- 
ed troublemaking tendencies at 
an early age. They knew there’d 
be a lucrative outlet for this 
when I grew up. They saw to it 
that I was channeled in the right 
directions all through school — 
special classes in Applied Des- 
truction, Advanced Irritation, 
Anger I and II . only the best 
teachers.” 



“You’re suggesting the Bu- 
reau’s an outlet for society’s regu- 
lar crop of troublemakers?” 
“Isn’t that obvious? And 
troublemakers naturally call for 
the services of troubleshooters. 
That’s an outlet for do-gooders. 
You’ve a check and balance sys- 
tem serving society.” 

McKie waited, watching the 
Pan-Spechi, wondering if his an- 
swers had gone far enough. 

“I speak as a Tax Watcher, 
you understand?” Bolin asked. 
“I understand.” 

“The public pays for this Bu- 
reau. In essence, the public is 
paying people to cause trouble.” 
“Isn’t that what we do when 
we hire police, tax investigators 
and the like?” McKie asked. 

A look of gloating satisfaction 
came over Bolin’s face. “But 
these agencies operate for the 
greater good of humanity!” he 
said. 

“Before he begins training,” 
McKie said, and his voice took 
on a solemn, lecturing tone, “the 
potential saboteur is shown the 
entire sordid record of history. 
The do-gooders succeeded once 
. long ago. They eliminated 
virtually all red tape from gov- 
ernment. This great machine 
with its power over human lives 
slipped into high speed. It moved 
faster and faster.” McKie’s voice 
grew louder. “Laws were con- 
ceived and passed in the same 



106 



GALAXY 



hour! Appropriations came and 
were gone in a fortnight. New 
bureaus flashed into existence 
for the most insubstantial rea- 
sons.” 

McKie took a deep breath, 
realizing he’d put sincere emo- 
tional weight behind his words. 

“Fascinating,” Bolin said. “Ef- 
ficient government, eh?” 

“Efficient?” McKie’s voice was 
filled with outrage. “It was like 
a great wheel thrown suddenly 
out of balance! The whole struc- 
ture of government was in im- 
minent danger of fragmenting 
before a handful of people, wise 
with hindsight, used measures of 
desperation and started what was 
called the Sabotage Corps.” 
“Ahhh, yes, I’ve heard about 
the Corps’ violence.” 

He’s needling me, McKie 
thought, but found that honest 
anger helped now. “All right, 
there was bloodshed and terrible 
destruction at the beginning,” he 
said. “But the big wheels were 
slowed. Government developed a 
controllable speed.” 

“Sabotage,” Bolin sneered. “In 
lieu of red tape.” 

I needed that reminder, McKie 
thought. 

“No task too small for Sab- 
otage, no task too large,” McKie 
said. “We keep the wheel turn- 
ing slowly and smoothly. Some 
anonymous Corpsman put it into 
words a long time ago: ‘When in 



doubt, delay the big ones and 
speed the little ones.’ ” 

4 CIT TouM you say the Tax 
’ ’ Watchers were a ‘big 
one’ or a ‘little one’?” Bolin ask- 
ed, his voice mild. 

“Big one,” McKie said and 
waited for Bolin to pounce. 

But the Pan-Spechi appeared 
amused. “An unhappy answer.” 

“As it says in the Constitu- 
tion,” McKie said. “ ‘The pursuit 
of unhappiness is an inalienable 
right of all humans.’ ” 

“Trouble is as trouble does,” 
Bolin said and clapped his hands. 

Two Pan-Spechi in the uni- 
forms of system police came 
through the creme de menthe 
emerald door. 

“You heard?” Bolin asked. 

“We heard,” one of the police 
said. 

‘“Was he defending his bu- 
reau?” Bolin asked. 

“He was,” the policeman said. 

“You’ve seen the court order,” 
Bolin said. “It pains me because 
Ser McKie accepted the hospital- 
ity of my house, but he must be 
held incommunicado until he’s 
needed in court. He’s to be treat- 
ed kindly, you understand?” 

Is he really bent on destroying 
the Bureau? McKie asked him- 
self in sudden consternation. Do 
I have it figured wrong? 

“You contend my words were 
sabotage?” McKie asked. 



THE TACTFUL SABOTEUR 



107 



“Clearly an attempt to sway 
the chief officer of the Tax 
Watchers from his avowed dut- 
ies,” Bolin said. He stood, bowed. 

McKie lifted himself out of 
the chairdog, assumed an air of 
confidence he did not feel. He 
clasped his thick-fingered hands 
together and bowed low, a grand- 
father toad rising from the deep 
to give his benediction. “In the 
words of the ancient proverb,” 
he said, “ ‘The righteous man 
lives deep within a cavern and 
the sky appears to him as noth- 
ing but a small round hole.’ ” 

Wrapping himself in dignity, 
McKie allowed the police to es- 
cort him from the room. 

Behind him, Bolin gave voice 
to puzzlement: “Now, what did 
he mean by that?” 

Ill 

6 6 T Y ear ye! Hear ye! System 
-*■ -*■ High Court, First Bench, 
Central Sector, is now in ses- 
sion!” 

The robo-clerk darted back 
and forth across the cleared lift 
dais of the courtarena, its metal 
curves glittering in the morning 
light that poured down through 
the domed weather cover. Its 
voice, designed to fit precisely 
into the great circular room, 
penetrated to the farthest walls: 
“All persons having petitions be- 
fore this court draw near!” 



The silvery half globe carrying 
First Magistrate Edwin Dooley 
glided through an aperture be- 
hind the lift dais and was raised 
to an appropriate height. His 
white sword of justice lay diag- 
onally across the bench in front 
of him. Dooley himself sat in dig- 
nified silence while the robo- 
clerk finished its stentorian an- 
nouncement and rolled to a stop 
just beyond the lift field. 

Judge Dooley was a tall, black 
browed man who affected the 
ancient look with ebon robes 
over white linen. He was noted 
for decisions of classic penetra- 
tion. 

He sat now with his face held 
in rigid immobility to conceal his 
anger and disquiet. Why had 
they put him in this hot spot? 
Because he’d granted the Tax 
Watchers’ injunction? No matter 
how he ruled now, the result 
likely would be uproar. Even 
President Hindley was watching 
this one through one of the hot- 
line projectors. 

The President had called 
shortly before this session. It had 
been Phil and Ed all through the 
conversation, but the intent re- 
mained clear. The Administra- 
tion was concerned about this 
case. Vital legislation pended; 
votes were needed. Neither the 
budget nor the Bureau of Sab- 
otage had entered their conversa- 
tion, but the President had made 



108 



GALAXY 



his point — don't compromise the 
Bureau but save that Tax Watch- 
er support for the Administra- 
tion! 

“Clerk, the roster,” Judge 
Dooley said. 

And he thought: They’ll get 
judgment according to strict in- 
terpretation of the law! Let them 
argue with that! 

The robo-clerk’s reelslate buz- 
zed. Words appeared on the re- 
peater in front of the judge as 
the clerk’s voice announced: 
“The People versus Clifton Watt, 
Jorj X. McKie and the Bureau 
of Sabotage.” 

Dooley looked down into the 
courtarena, noting the group 
seated at the black oblong table 
in the Defense ring on his left: 
a sour-faced Watt with his rain- 
bow horror of Medusa head, Mc- 
Kie’s fat features composed in 
the look of someone trying not to 
snicker at a sly joke — the two 
defendants flanking their attor- 
ney, Pander Oulson, the Bureau 
of Sabotage’s chief counsel. Oul- 
son was a great thug of a figure 
in defense white with glistening 
eyes under beetle brows and a 
face fashioned mostly of scars. 

At the Prosecution table on the 
right sat Prosecutor Holjance 
Vohnbrook, a tall scarecrow of 
a man dressed in conviction red. 
Gray hair topped a stern face as 
grim and forbidding as a latter 
day Cotton Mather. Beside him 



sat a frightened appearing young 
aide and Panthor Bolin, the Pan- 
Spechi complaintant, his multi- 
faceted eyes hidden beneath 
veined lids. 

“Are we joined for trial?” 
Dooley asked. 

Both Oulson and Vohnbrook 
arose, nodded. 

“If the court pleases,” Vohn- 
brook rumbled, “I would like to 
remind the Bureau of Sabotage 
personnel present that this court 
is exempt from their ministra- 
tions.” 

“If the prosecutor trips over 
his own feet,” Oulson said, “I 
assure him it will be his own 
clumsiness and no act of mine 
nor of my colleagues.” 

Vohnbrook’s face darkened 
with a rush of blood. “It’s well 
known how you . .” 

A great drumming boomed 
through the courtarena as 
Dooley touched the handle of his 
sword of office. The sound 
drowned the prosecutor’s words. 
When silence was restored, Dool- 
ey said : “This court will tolerate 
no displays of personality. I wish 
that understood at the outset.” 

Oulson smiled, a look like a 
grimace in his scarred face. “I 
apologize, Your Honor,” he said. 

Dooley sank back into his 
chair, noting the gleam in Oul- 
son’s eyes. It occurred to Dooley 
then that the defense attorney, 



THE TACTFUL SABOTEUR 



109 



sabotage-trained, could have 
brought on the prosecutor’s at- 
tack to gain the court’s sym- 
pathy. 

“The char-ge is outlaw sabotage 
in violation of this court’s in- 
junction,” Dooley said. “I un- 
derstand that opening statements 
have been waived by both sides, 
the public having been admitted 
to causae in this matter by ap- 
propriate postings?” 

“So recorded,” intoned the 
robo- clerk. 

Oulson leaned forward against 
the defense table, said: “Your 
Honor, defendant Jorj X. McKie 
has not accepted me as counsel 
and wishes to argue for separate 
trial. I am here now representing 
only the Bureau and Clinton 
Watt.” 

“Who is appearing for defend- 
ant McKie?” the judge asked. 

McKie, feeling like a man leap- 
ing over a precipice, got to his 
feet, said: “I wish to represent 
myself, Your Honor.” 

“You should be cautioned 
against this course,” Dooley said. 

“Ser Oulson has advised me I 
have a fool for a client,” McKie 
said. “But in common with most 
Bureau agents, I have legal train- 
ing. I’ve been admitted to the 
System Bar and have practiced 
under such codes as the Gow- 
achin where the double-negative 
innocence requirement must be 
satisfied before bringing crim- 

,110 



inal accusation against the pros- 
ecutor and proceeding backward 
the premise that . 

“This is not Gowacliin,” Judge 
Dooley said. 

“May I remind the Court,” 
Vohnbrook said, “that defendant 
McKie is a saboteur extraordin- 
ary. This goes beyond questions 
of champerty. Every utterance 
this man . 

“The law’s the same for of- 
ficial saboteurs as it is for oth- 
ers in respect to the issue at 
hand,” Oulson said. 

“Gentlemen!” the judge said. 
“If you please? I will decide law 
in this court.” He waited through 
a long moment of silence. “The 
behavior of all parties in this 
matter is receiving my most 
careful attention.” 

McKie forced himself to rad- 
iate calm good humor. 

V^tTatt, whose profound knowl- 
' ' edge of the saboteur ex- 
traordinary made this pose a 
danger signal, tugged violently 
at the sleeve of defense attorney 
Oulson. Oulson waved him away. 
Watt glowered at McKie. 

“If the court permits,” McKie 
said, “a joint defense on the 
present charge would appear to 
violate . 

“The court is well aware that 
this case was bound over on the 
basis of deposa summation 
through a ruling by a robo- 



GALAXY 



legum,” Dooley said. “I warn 
both defense and prosecution, 
however, that I make my own 
decisions in such matters. Law 
and robo-legum are both human 
constructions and require human 
interpretation. And I will add 
that, as far as I’m concerned, in 
all conflicts between human 
agencies and machine agencies 
the human agencies are para- 
mount.” 

“Is this a hearing or a trial?” 
McKie asked. 

“We will proceed as in trial, 
subject to the evidence as pre- 
sented.” 

McKie rested his palms on the 
edge of the defense table, study- 
ing the judge. The saboteur felt 
a surge of misgiving. Dooley was 
a no-nonsense customer. He had 
left himself a wide avenue with- 
in the indictment. And this was 
a case that went far beyond im- 
mediate danger to the Bureau of 
Sabotage. Far-reaching prece- 
dents could be set here this day 
• — or disaster could strike. Ignor- 
ing instincts of self preservation, 
McKie wondered if he dared try 
sabotage within the confines of 
the court. 

“The robo-legum indictment 
requires joint defense,” McKie 
said. “I admit sabotage against 
Ser Clinton Watt, but remind the 
court of Paragraph Four, section 
ninety-one, of the Semantic Re- 
vision to the Constitution, where- 



in the Secretary of Sabotage is 
exempted from all immunities. 
I move to quash the indictment 
as it regards myself. I was at the 
time a legal officer of the Bu- 
reau required by my duties to 
test the abilities of my super- 
ior.” 

Vohnbrook scowled at McKie. 

“Mmmm,” Dooley said. He 
saw that the prosecutor had de- 
tected where McKie’s logic must 
lead. If McKie were legally dis- 
missed from the Bureau at the 
time of his conversation with the 
Pan-Spechi, the prosecution’s 
case might fall through. 

“Does the prosecutor wish to 
seek a conspiracy indictment?” 
Dooley asked. 

For the first time since enter- 
ing the courtarena, defense at- 
torney Oulson appeared agitated. 
He bent his scarred features 
close to Watt’s gorgon head, con- 
ferred in whispers with the de- 
fendant. Oulson’s face grew 
darker and darker as he whisper- 
ed. Watt’s gorgon tendrils writh- 
ed in agitation. 

“We don’t seek a conspiracy 
indictment at this time,” Vohn- 
brook said. “However, we would 
be willing to separate . 

“Your Honor!” Oulson said, 
surging to his feet. “Defense 
must protest separation of indict- 
ments at this time. It’s our con- 
tention that . 

“Court cautions both counsel

in this matter that this is not a 
Gowachin jurisdiction,” Dooley 
said in an angry voice. “We don’t 
have to convict the defender and 
exonerate the prosecutor before 
trying a case! However, if either 
of you would wish a change of 
venue . 

Vohnbrook, a smug expression 
on his lean face, bowed to the 
judge. “Your Honor,” he said, 
“we wish at this time to request 
removal of defendant McKie 
from the indictment and ask 
that, he be held as a prosecu- 
tion witness.” 



t C^'lbjection!” Oulson shouted. 

“Prosecution well knows 
it cannot hold a key witness un- 
der trumped up . 

“Overruled,” Dooley said. 

“Exception!” 

“Noted.” 

Dooley waited as Oulson sank 
into his chair. This is a day to 
remember , the judge thought. 
Sabotage itself outfoxed! Then 
he noted the glint of sly humor 
in the eyes of saboteur extra- 
ordinary McKie, realizing with 
an abrupt sense of caution that 
McKie, too, had maneuvered for 
this position. 

“Prosecution may call its first 
witness,” the judge said, and he 
punched a code signal that sent 
a robo-aide to escort McKie 
away from the defense table and 
into a holding box. 



A look of almost-pleasure 
came over prosecutor Vohn- 
brook’s cadaverous face. He rub- 
bed one of his downdrooping 
eyelids, said: “Call Panthor Bo- 
lin.” 

The Achusian capitalist got to 
his feet, strode to the witness 
ring. The robo-clerk’s screen 
flashed for the record: “Panthor 
Bolin of Achus IV, certified wit- 
ness in case A0115BD i ,gGY74R( ) 
of System High Court ZRZ 1 .” 

“The oath of sincerity having 
been administered, Panthor Bo- 
lin is prepared for testifying,” 
the robo-clerk recited. 

“Panthor Bolin, are you chief 
officer of the civil organization 
known as the Tax Watchers?” 
Vohnbrook asked. 

“I . ah . y-yes,” Bolin 
faltered. He passed a large blue 
handkerchief across his forehead, 
staring sharply at McKie. 

He just now realizes what it 
is I must do, McKie thought. 

“I show you this recording 
from the robo-legum indictment 
proceedings,” Vohnbrook said. 
“It is certified by System police 
as being a conversation between 
yourself and Jorj X. McKie in 
which . .” 

“Your Honor!” Oulson ob- 
jected. “Both witnesses to this 
alleged conversation are present 
in this courtarena. There are 
more direct ways to bring out 
any pertinent information from 



112 



GALAXY 



this matter. Further, since the 
clear threat of a conspiracy 
charge remains in this case, I ob- 
ject to introducing this recording 
as forcing a man to testify 
against himself.” 

“Ser McKie is no longer on 
trial here and Ser Oulson is not 
McKie’s attorney of record,” 
Vohnbrook gloated. 

“The objection does, however, 
have some merit,” Dooley said. 
He looked at McKie seated in 
the holding box. 

“There’s nothing shameful 
about that conversation with Ser 
Bolin,” McKie said. “I’ve no ob- 
jection to introducing this rec- 
ord of the conversation.” 

Bolin rose up on his toes, 
made as though to speak, sank 
back. 

Now he is certain, McKie 
thought. 

“Then I will admit this record 
subject to judicial deletions,” 
Dooley said. 

Clinton Watt, seated at the 
defense table, buried his gorgon 
head in his arms. 

Vohnbrook, a death’s-head 
grin on his long face, said: “Ser 
Bolin, I show you this recording. 
Now, in this conversation, was 
Sabotage Agent McKie subjected 
to any form of coercion?” 

“Objection!” Oulson roared, 
surging to his feet. His scarred 
face was a scowling mask. “At 
the time of this alleged record- 



ing, Ser McKie was not an agent 
of the Bureau!” He looked at 
Vohnbrook. “Defense objects to 
the prosecutor’s obvious effort to 
link Ser McKie with . .” 
“Alleged conversation!” Vohn- 
brook snarled. “Ser McKie him- 
self admits the exchange!” 

Tn a weary voice, Dooley said: 
“Objection sustained. Unless 
tangible evidence of conspiracy 
is introduced here, references to 
Ser McKie as an agent of Sabo- 
tage will not be admitted here.” 
“But, Your Honor,” Vohn- 
brook protested, “Ser McKie’s 
own actions preclude any other 
interpretation!” 

“I’ve ruled on this point,” 
Dooley said “Proceed.” 

McKie got to his feet in the 
holding box, said: “Would Your 
Honor permit me to act as a 
friend of the Court here?” 

Dooley leaned back, hand on 
chin, turning the question over 
in his mind. A general feeling 
of uneasiness about the case was 
increasing in him and he couldn’t 
pinpoint it. McKie’s every ac- 
tion appeared suspect. Dooley re- 
minded himself that the sabot- 
eur extraordinary was notorious 
for sly plots, for devious and 
convoluted schemes of the wild- 
est and most improbable inver- 
sions — like onion layers in a 
five dimensional klein-shape. The 
man’s success in practicing under 



THE TACTFUL SABOTEUR 



113 



the Gowachin legal code could 
be understood. 

“You may explain what you 
have in mind,” Dooley said, “but 
I’m not yet ready to admit your 
statements into the record.” 

“The Bureau of Sabotage’s 
own Code would clarify mat- 
ters,” McKie said, realizing that 
these words burned his bridges 
behind him. “My action in suc- 
cessfully sabotaging acting Sec- 
retary Watt is a matter of rec- 
ord.” 

McKie pointed to the gorgon 
mass visible as Watt lifted his 
head and glared across the room. 

“Acting Secretary?” the judge 
asked. 

“So it must be presumed,” 
McKie said. “Under the Bureau’s 
Code, once the Secretary is sa- 
botaged he . 

“Your Honor!” Oulson shout- 
ed. “We are in danger of breach 
of security here! I understand 
these proceedings are being 
broadcast!” 

“As Director-in-Limbo of the 
Bureau of Sabotage, I will de- 
cide what is a breach of security 
and what isn’t!” McKie snapped. 

Watt returned his head to his 
arms, groaned. 

Oulson sputtered. 

Dooley stared at McKie in 
shock. 

Vohnbrook broke the spell. 
The prosecutor said: “Your Hon- 
or, this man has not been sworn 



to sincerity. I suggest we excuse 
Ser Bolin for the time being and 
have Ser McKie continue his 
explanation under oath.” 

Dooley took a deep breath, 
said: “Does defense have any 
questions of Ser Bolin at this 
time?” 

“Not at this time,” Oulson 
muttered. “I presume he’s sub- 
ject to recall?” 

“He is,” Dooley said, turning 
to McKie. “Take the witness 
ring, Ser McKie.” 

IV 

IQolin, moving like a sleepwalk- 
er, stepped out of the ring, 
returned to the prosecution table. 
The Pan-Spechi’s multifaceted 
eyes reflected an odd glitter, 
moving with a trapped sense of 
evasiveness. 

McKie entered the ring, took 
the oath and faced Vohnbrook, 
composing his features in a look 
of purposeful decisiveness that 
he knew his actions must reflect. 

“You called yourself Director- 
in-Limbo of the Bureau of Sa- 
botage,” Vohnbrook said. “Would 
you explain that, please?” 

Before McKie could answer, 
Watt lifted his head from his 
arms, growled: “You traitor, Mc- 
Kie!” 

Dooley grabbed the pommel of 
his sword of justice to indicate 
an absolute position and barked: 



114 



GALAXY 



“I will tolerate no outbursts in 
my court!” 

Oulson put a hand on Watt’s 
shoulder. Both of them glared 
at McKie. The medusa tendrils 
of Watt’s head writhed as they 
ranged through the rainbow 
spectrum. 

“I caution the witness,” Dooley 
said, “that his remarks would 
appear to admit a conspiracy. 
Anything he says now may be 
used against him.” 

“No conspiracy, Your Honor,” 
McKie said. He faced Vohn- 
broolc, but appeared to be ad- 
dressing Watt. “Over the cen- 
turies, the function of Sabotage 
in the government has grown 
more and more open, but cer- 
tain aspects of changing the 
guard, so to speak, have been 
held as a highly placed secret. 
The rule is that if a man can 
protect himself from sabotage 
he’s fit to boss Sabotage. Once 
sabotaged, however, the Bureau’s 
Secretary must resign and sub- 
mit his position to the President 
and the full Cabinet.” 

“He’s out?” Dooley asked. 
“Not necessarily,” McKie said. 
“If the act of sabotage against 
the Secretary is profound enough, 
subtle enough, carries enough 
far reaching effects, the Secre- 
tary is replaced by the successful 
saboteur. He is, indeed, out.” 
“Then it’s now up to the Presi- 
dent and the Cabinet to decide 



between Ser Watt and yourself, 
is that what you’re saying?” 
Dooley asked. 

“Me?” McKie asked. “No, 
I’m Director-in-Limbo because 
I accomplished a successful act 
of sabotage against Ser Watt and 
because I happen to be senior 
saboteur extraordinary on duty.” 

“But it’s alleged that you were 
fired,” Vohnbrook objected. 

“A formality,” McKie said. 
“It’s customary to fire the sab- 
oteur who’s successful in such an 
effort. This makes him eligible 
for appointment as Secretary if 
he so aspires. However, I have 
no such ambition at this time.” 

W att jerked upright, staring 
at McKie. 

McKie ran a finger around his 
collar, realizing the physical peril 
he was about to face. A glance 
at the Pan-Spechi confirmed the 
feeling. Panthor Bolin was hold- 
ing himself in check by a visible 
effort. 

“This is all very interesting,” 
Vohnbrook sneered, “but how 
can it possibly have any bearing 
on the present action? The 
charge here is outlaw sabotage 
against the Tax Watchers repre- 
sented by the person of Ser Pan- 
thor Bolin. If Ser McKie . .” 
“If the distinguished Prosecu- 
tor will permit me,” McKie said, 
“I believe I can set his fears at 
rest. It should be obvious to — ”

“There’s conspiracy here!” 
Vohnbrook shouted. “What about

A loud pounding interrupted 
him as Judge Dooley lifted his 
sword, its theremin effect filling 
the room. When silence had been * 
restored, the judge lowered his 
sword, replaced it firmly on the 
ledge in front of him. 

Dooley took a moment to 
calm himself. He sensed now the 
delicate political edge he walked 
and thanked his stars that he 
had left the door open to rule 
tha' the present session was a 
hearing. 

“We will now proceed in an 
orderly fashion,” Dooley said. 
“That’s one of the things courts 
are for, you know.” He took a 
deep breath. “Now, there are 
several people present whose 
dedication to the maintenance of 
law and order should be beyond 
question I’d think that among 
those we should number Ser 
Prosecutor Vohnbrook; the dis- 
tinguished defense counsel, Ser 
Oulson: Ser Bolin, whose race is 
noted for its reasonableness and 
humanity; and the distinguished 
representatives of the Bureau of 
Sabotage, whose actions may at 
times annoy and anger us, but 
who are, we know, consecrated 
to the principle of strengthening 
us and exposing our inner re- 
sources.” 

This judge missed his calling, 



McKie thought. With speeches 
like that, he could get into the 
Legislative branch. 

Abashed, Vohnbrook sank back 
into his chair. 

“Now,” the judge said, “un- 
less I’m mistaken, Ser McKie 
has referred to two acts of sab- 
otage.” Dooley glanced down at 
McKie. “Ser McKie?” 

“So it would appear, Your 
Honor,” McKie said, hoping he 
read the judge’s present attitude 
correctly. “However, this court 
may be in a unique position to 
rule on that very question. You 
see, Your Honor, the alleged act 
of sabotage to which I refer was 
initiated by a Pan-Spechi agent 
of the Bureau. Now, though, the 
secondary benefits of that action 
appear to be sought after by a 
creche mate of that agent, 
whose . .” 

“You dare suggest that I’m 
not the holder of my cell’s ego?” 
Bolin demanded. 

Without knowing quite where 
it was or what it was, McKie 
was aware that a weapon had 
been trained on him by the Pan- 
Spechi. References in their cul- 
ture to the weapon for defense 
of the ego were clear enough. 

“I make no such suggestion,” 
McKie said, speaking hastily and 
with as much sincerity as he 
could put into his voice. “But 
surely you cannot have misin- 
terpreted the terranic-human cul- 



116

ture so much that you do not 
know what will happen now.” 

XI Tamed by some instinct, the 
’ * judge and other spectators 
to this interchange remained 
silent. 

Bolin appeared to be tremb- 
ling in every cell of his body. “I 
am distressed,” he muttered. 

“If there were a way to achieve 
the necessary rapport and avoid 
that distress I would have taken 
it,” McKie said. “Can you see 
another way?” 

Still trembling, Bolin said: “I 
must do what I must do.” 

In a low voice, Dooley said: 
“Ser McKie, just what is going 
on here?” 



“Two cultures are, at last, at- 
tempting to understand each 
other,” McKie said. “We’ve 
lived together in apparent under- 
standing for centuries, but ap- 
pearances can be deceptive.” 

Oulson started to rise, was 
pulled back by Watt. 

And McKie noted that his for- 
mer Bureau chief had assessed 
the peril here. It was a point in 
Watt’s favor. 

“You understand, Ser Bolin,” 
McKie said, watching the Pan- 
Spechi carefully, “that these 
things must be brought into the 
open and discussed carefully be- 
fore a decision can be reached 
in this court. It’s a rule of law 
to which you’ve submitted. I’m

inclined to favor your bid for 
the Secretariat, but my own deci- 
sion awaits the outcome of this 
hearing.” 

“What things must be discuss- 
ed?” Dooley demanded. “And 
what gives you the right, Ser 
McKie, to call this a hearing?” 

“A figure of speech,” McKie 
said, but he kept his attention 
on the Pan-Spechi, wondering 
what the terrible weapon was 
that the race used in defense of 
its egos. “What do you say, Ser 
Bolin?” 

“You protect the sanctity of 
your home life,” Bolin said. “Do 
you deny me the same right?” 

“Sanctity, not secrecy,” Mc- 
Kie said. 

Dooley looked from McKie to 
Bolin, noted the compressed- 
spring look of the Pan-Spechi, 
the way he kept a hand hidden 
in a jacket pocket. It occurred 
to the judge then that the Pan- 
Spechi might have a weapon 
ready to use against others in 
this court. Bolin had that look 
about him. Dooley hesitated on 
the point of calling guards, re- 
viewed what he knew of the 
Pan-Spechi. He decided not to 
cause a crisis. The Pan-Spechi 
were admitted to the concourse 
of humanity, good friends but 
terrible enemies, and there were 
always those allusions to their 
hidden powers, to their ego jeal- 
ousies, to the fierceness with 



which they defended the secrecy 
of their creches. 

Slowly, Bolin overcame the 
trembling. “Say what you feel 
you must,” he growled. 

j\ /TcKie said a silent prayer of 
-*- * -*- hope that the Pan-Spechi 
could control his reflexes, ad- 
dressed himself to the nexus of 
pickups on the far wall that was 
recording this courtarena scene 
for broadcast to the entire uni- 
verse. 

“A Pan-Spechi who took the 
name of Napoleon Bildoon was 
one of the leading agents in the 
Bureau of Sabotage,” McKie 
said. “Agent Bildoon dropped 
from sight at the time Panthor 
Bolin took over as chief of the 
Tax Watchers. It’s highly prob- 
able that the Tax Watcher or- 
ganization is an elaborate and 
subtle sabotage of the Bureau 
of Sabotage itself, a move ori- 
ginated by Bildoon.” 

“There is no such person as 
Bildoon!” Bolin cried. 

“Ser McKie,” Judge Dooley 
said, “would you care to con- 
tinue this interchange in the pri- 
vacy of my chambers?” The 
judge stared down at the sab- 
oteur, trying to appear kindly 
but firm. 

“Your Honor,” McKie said, 
“may we, out of respect for a 
fellow human, leave that deci- 
sion to Ser Bolin?” 



118 



GALAXY 



Bolin turned his multi-faceted 
eyes toward the bench, spoke 
in a low voice: “If the court 
please, it were best this were 
done openly.” He jerked his 
hand from his pocket. It came 
out empty. He leaned across 
the table, gripped the far edge. 
“Continue, if you please, Ser.” 

McKie swallowed, momentar- 
ily overcome with admiration 
for the Pan-Spechi. “It will be 
a distinct pleasure to serve un- 
der you, Ser Bolin,” McKie 
said. 

“Do what you must!” Bolin 
rasped. 

McKie looked from the won- 
derment in the faces of Watt 
and the attorneys up to the 
questioning eyes of Judge 
Dooley. “In Pan-Spechi par- 
lance, there is no person called 
Bildoon. But there was such a 
person, a group mate of Ser 
Bolin. I hope you notice the 
similarity in the names they 
chose for themselves?” 

“Ah . yes,” Dooley said. 

“I’m afraid I’ve been some- 
what of a nosey Parker, a peep- 
ing Tom and several other cate- 
gories of snoop where the Pan- 
Spechi are concerned,” McKie 
said. “But it was because I sus- 
pected the act of sabotage to 
which I’ve referred here. The 
Tax Watchers revealed too 
much inside knowledge of the 
Bureau of Sabotage.” 



“I . ah . am not quite 
sure I understand you,” Dooley 
said 

“The best kept secret in the 
universe, the Pan-Spechi cyclic 
change of gender and identity, 
is no longer a secret where I’m 
concerned,” McKie said. He 
swallowed as he saw Bolin’s 
fingers go white where they 
tightly gripped the prosecution 
table. 

“It relates to the issue at 
hand?” Dooley asked. 

“Most definitely, Your Hon- 
or,” McKie said. “You see, the 
Pan-Spechi have a unique 
gland that controls mentation, 
dominance, the relationship be- 
tween reason and instinct. The 
five group mates are, in reality, 
one person. I wish to make that 
clear for reasons of legal neces- 
sity.” 

“Legal necessity?” Dooley 
asked. He glanced down at the 
obviously distressed Bolin, back 
to McKie. 

“The gland, when it’s func- 
tioning, confers ego dominance 
on the Pan-Spechi in whom it 
functions. But it functions for 
a time that’s definitely limited 
— twenty-five to thirty years.” 
McKie looked at Bolin. Again, 
the Pan-Spechi was trembling. 
“Please understand, Ser Bolin,” 
he said, “that I do this out of 
necessity and that this is not 
an act of sabotage.” 



THE TACTFUL SABOTEUR 



119 



B olin lifted his face toward 
McKie. The Pan-Spechi’s 
features appeared contorted in 
grief. “Get it over with, man!” 
he rasped. 

“Yes,” McKie said, turning 
back to the judge’s puzzled face. 
“Ego transfer in the Pan- 
Spechi, Your Honor, involves a 
transfer of what may be termed 
basic - experience - learning. It’s 
accomplished through physical 
contractor when the ego holder 
dies, no matter how far he may 
be separated from the creche, 
this seems to fire up the eldest 
of the creche triplets. The ego- 
single also bequeaths a verbal 
legacy to his mate whenever 
possible — and that’s most of the 
time. Specifically, it’s this 
time.” 

Dooley leaned back. He was 
beginning to see the legal ques- 
tion McKie’s account had 
posed. 

“The act of sabotage which 
might make a Pan-Spechi el- 
igible for appointment as Sec- 
retary of the Bureau of Sabo- 
tage was initiated by a ... ah 
. cell mate of the Ser Bolin 
in court today, is that it?” 
Dooley asked. 

McKie wiped his brow. “Cor- 
rect, Your Honor.” 

“But that cell mate is no long- 
er the ego dominant, eh?” 
“Quite right, Your Honor.” 
“The . ah . former ego 



holder, this . ah . Bildoon, 
is no longer eligible?” 

“Bildoon, or what was once 
Bildoon, is a creature operating 
solely on instinct now, Your 
Honor,” McKie said. “Capable 
of acting as creche nurse for a 
time and, eventually, fulfilling 
another destiny I’d rather not 
explain.” 

“I see.” Dooley looked at the 
weather cover of the court arena. 
He was beginning to see what 
McKie had risked here. “And 
you favor this, ah, Ser Bolin’s 
bid for the Secretariat?” Dooley 
asked. 

“If President Hindley and the 
Cabinet follow the recommend- 
ation of the Bureau’s senior 
agents, the procedure always 
followed in the past, Ser Bolin 
will be the new Secretary,” Mc- 
Kie said. “I favor this.” 

“Why?” Dooley asked. 

“Because of this unique rov- 
ing ego, the Pan-Spechi have a 
more communal attitude toward 
fellow sentients than do most 
other species admitted to the 
concourse of humanity,” McKie 
said. “This translates as a sense 
of responsibility toward all life. 
They’re not necessarily maudlin 
about it. They oppose where 
it’s necessary to build strength. 
Their creche life demonstrates 
several clear examples of this 
which I’d prefer not to de- 
scribe.” 



120 



GALAXY 



“I see,” Dooley said, but he 
had to admit to himself that he 
did not. McKie’s allusions to 
unspeakable practices were be- 
ginning to annoy him. “And you 
feel that this Bildoon-Bolin act 
of sabotage qualifies him, pro- 
vided this court rules they are 
one and the same person?” 

“We’re not the same person!” 
Bolin cried. “You don’t dare 
say I’m that . that shambling, 
clinging . .” 

“Easy,” McKie said. “Ser 
Bolin, I’m sure you see the need 
for this legal fiction.” 

“Legal fiction,” Bolin said as 
though clinging to the words. 
The multi-faceted eyes glared 
across the courtarena at McKie. 
“Thank you for the verbal nic- 
ety, McKie.” 

“You’ve not answered my 
question, Ser McKie,” Dooley 
said, ignoring the exchange with 
Bolin. 

“Sabotaging Ser Wf£t through 
an attack on the entire Bureau 
contains sublety and finesse 
never before achieved in such an 
effort,” McKie said. “The en- 
tire Bureau will be strengthened 
by it.” 

McKie glanced at Watt. The 
acting Secretary’s medusa tan- 
gle had ceased its writhing. He 
was staring at Bolin with a 
speculative look in his eyes. 
Sensing the quiet in the court- 
arena, he glanced up at McKie. 



“Don’t you agree. Ser Watt?” 
McKie asked. 

“Oh, yes. Quite,” Watt said. 
The note of sincerity in Watt’s 
voice startled the judge. For 
the first time, he wondered at 
the dedication which these men 
brought to their jobs. 

“Sabotage is a very sensitive 
Bureau,” Dooley said. “I’ve 
some serious reservations — ” 

“If Your Honor please,” Mc- 
Kie said, “forbearance is one of 
the chief attributes a saboteur 
can bring to his duties. Now, I 
wish you to understand what 
our Pan-Spechi friend has done 
here this day. Let us suppose 
that I had spied upon the most 
intimate moments between you, 
Judge, and your wife, and that 
I reported them in detail here 
in open court with half the uni- 
verse looking on. Let us suppose 
further that you had the strict- 
est moral code against such dis- 
cussions with outsiders. Let us 
suppose that I made these dis- 
closures in the basest terms with 
every four-letter word at my 
command. Let us suppose that 
you were armed, traditionally, 
with a deadly weapon to strike 
at such blasphemers, such — ” 
“Filth!” Bolin grated. 

“Yes,” McKie said. “Filth. Do 
you suppose, Your Honor, that 
you could have stood by with- 
out killing me?” 

“God heavens!” Dooley said.

CtOer Bolin,” McKie said, “I 
^ offer you and all your race 
my most humble apologies.” 

“I’d hoped once to undergo 
the ordeal in the privacy of a 
judge’s chambers with as few 
outsiders as possible,” Bolin 
said. “But once you were started 
in open court . .” 

“It had to be this way,” Mc- 
Kie said. “If we’d done it in 
private, people would’ve come 
to be suspicious about a Pan- 
Spechi in control of . .” 
“People?” Bolin asked. 

“Non Pan-Spechi,” McKie 
said. “It’d have been a barrier 
between our species. 

“And we’ve been strength- 
ened by all this,” McKie said. 
“Those provisions of the Con- 
stitution that provide the people 
with a slowly moving govern- 
ment have been demonstrated 
anew. We’ve admitted the pub- 
lic to the inner workings of Sab- 
otage, shown them the valuable 
character of the man who’ll be 
the new Secretary.” 

“I’ve not yet ruled on the 
critical issue here,” Dooley said. 

“But Your Honor!” McKie 
said. 

“With all due respect to you 
as a saboteur extraordinary, Ser 
McKie,” Dooley said, “I’ll 
make my decision on evidence 
gathered under my direction.” 




122 



GALAXY 



He looked at Bolin. “Ser Bolin, 
would you permit an agent of 
this court to gather such evi- 
dence as will allow me to ren- 
der verdict without fear of 
harming my own species?” 

“We’re humans together,” 
Bolin growled. 

“But terranic humans hold 
the balance of power,” Dooley 
said. “I owe allegiance to law, 
yes, but my terranic fellows de- 
pend on me, too. I have a . 

“You wish your own agents to 
determine if Ser McKie has 
told the truth about us?” 

“Ah . yes,” Dooley said. 
Bolin looked at McKie. “Ser 
McKie, it is I who apologize to 
you. I had not realized how 
deeply xenophobia penetrated 
your fellows.” 

“Because,” McKie said, “out- 
side of your natural modesty, 
you have no such fear. I sus- 
pect you know the phenomenon 
only through reading of us.” 
“But all strangers are poten- 
tial sharers of identity,” Bolin 
said. “Ah, well.” 

“If you’re through with your 
little chat,” Dooley said, “would 
you care to answer my question, 
Ser Bolin? This is still I hope, 
a court of law.” 

“Tell me, Your Honor,” Bolin 
said, “would you permit me to 
witness the tenderest intimacies 
between you and your wife?” 



D ooley’s face darkened, but 
he saw suddenly in all of 
its stark detail the extent of 
McKie’s analogy and it was to 
the judge’s credit that he rose 
to the occasion. “If it were ne- 
cessary to promote understand- 
ing,” he rasped, “yes!” 

“I believe you would,” Bolin 
murmured. He took a deep 
breath. “After what I’ve been 
through here today, one more 
sacrifice can be borne, I guess. 
I grant your investigators the 
privilege requested, but advise 
that they be discreet.” 

“It will strengthen you for 
the trials ahead as Secretary of 
the Bureau,” McKie said. “The 
Secretary, you must bear in 
mind, has no immunities from 
sabotage whatsoever.” 

“But,” Bolin said, “the Sec- 
retary’s legal orders carrying 
out his Constitutional functions 
must be obeyed by all agents.” 
McKie nodded, seeing in the 
glitter of Bolin’s eyes, a vista 
of peeping Tom assignments 
with endless detailed reports to 
the Secretary of Sabotage — at 
least until the fellow’s curiosity 
had been satisfied and his need 
for revenge satiated. 

But the others in the court- 
room, not having McKie’s in- 
sight, merely wondered at the 
question: What did he really 

mean by that?

Poor liftle computer! It couldn't

. and neither could anyone else ! 



4 4 TT* piktistes tells me that you 
are onto something big, 
Mr. Smirnov,” Valery said, turn- 
ing to her companion. 

“Epikt has the loudest mouth 
of any machine I was ever asso- 
ciated with,” Gregory Smirnov 
growled. “I never saw one that 
could keep a secret. But this one 
goes to extremes. Actually, we 
don’t have a thing. We’re just 
fiddling around with an unborn 
idea.” 

“How about it, Epikt?” Va- 
lery asked. 



“Big, real big,” the machine 
issued. 

“What are you doing now, 
Epikt?” Valery wanted to know. 

“Talk to me, dammit! I’m the 
man, he’s the machine,” Smir- 
nov cut in. “He’s chewing ency- 
clopedias and other references. 
It’s all he ever does.” 

“I thought he went through 
them all long ago.” 

“Certainly, dozens of times. 
He has all the data that can be 
fed into a machine, and every 
day we shovel in bales of the 



124 



new stuff. But he’s chewing it 
now for a very different pur- 
pose.” 

“What different purpose, Mr. 

Smirnov?” 

“It’s difficult to say because I 
haven’t as yet been able to state 
it to him. We’re trying to set a 
problem where it seems there 
ought to be one — and then an- 
swer it. We may find the answer 
before the question. At first, he 
rejected my request, later he ac- 
cepted it — ironically. I doubt 
that he’s sincere now. He can be 
quite a clown, as you should well 
know.” 

“I know that you two are onto 
something good,” Valery said. 
“The more you deny it, the more 
I’m sure of it. Tell me the truth, 
Epikt.” 

“Big, real big,” Epiktistes is- 
sued to Valery. 

“Valery,” said Smirnov. 
“You’re a woman and you might 
be inclined to say something 
about this to the other Institute 
people. Please don’t. We don’t 
have anything yet and it makes 
me nervous to have hot little 
people breathing down my 
neck.” 

“I won’t say a word,” Valery 
swore with grave insincerity. 
She winked at the machine, and 
Epikt winked back at her with 
three tiers of eyes. Valery Mok 
and Epiktistes had a thing going 
with each other. 



X Talery was nearly as bad as a 
* machine at not being able 
to keep a secret. She had the 
whole Institute staff excited 
about what Smirnov and Epik- 
tistes were working on. The staff 
consisted of Charles Cogsworth, 
her own over-shadowed husband, 
Glasser the stiff-necked inventor 
of the E.P. Locator and Aloysius 
Shiplap the seminal genius. 

They were all after Smirnov 
and his machine the next day. 

“We’ve been together on ev- 
ery project,” Glasser said. “Va- 
lery tells us that the problem 
hasn’t been properly formulat- 
ed, and that Epikt has only ac- 
cepted it ironically. We’re pret- 
ty good at formulating prob- 
lems, Gregory, and a little stern- 
er than you, when it comes to 
dealing with clownish ma- 
chines.” 

“All right, this is the way it is, 
Glasser,” Smirnov said re- 
luctantly. “My first statement 
was, we should seek to discover 
something not known to exist, by 
a close study of the absence of 
evidence. When I put the prob- 
lem to Epiktistes in this general- 
ized form he just laughed at me.” 

“That would have been my 
first impulse too, Smirnov,” said 
Shiplap. “Don’t you have a bet- 
ter idea of what you’re looking 
for?” 

“Shiplap, I had the feeling of 
trying to remember something 



WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT TOWN? 



125 



that I’d been compelled to for- 
get. My second statement wasn’t 
much better. ‘Let us see,’ I said 
to Epikt, ‘if we cannot recon- 
struct something of which even 
the idea has been completely 
eradicated, let’s see if we can’t 
find it by considering the exces- 
sive evidence that it was never 
there.’ In this form, Epikt ac- 
cepted it. Or else he decided to 
go along with me for the gag. 
I’m never quite sure how this 
clanking machine takes things.” 

“Well, no hole can be filled 
up perfectly,” said Cogsworth. 
“There will either be too much 
or too little of whatever is being 
used as the filler, or it will be of 
a different texture. The diffi- 
culty is that you didn’t give 
Epikt any clues. There will be a 
million things forgotten or re- 
pressed that will show an irreg- 
ularity of fill. How will Epikt 
know which of them is the one 
that you are somehow trying to 
remember?” 

“Item. The buried thing will 
have a buried tie with my boss 
man Smirnov,” Epiktistes, the 
machine, issued. 

“Yes, of course,” said Glasser. 
“Has Epikt turned up any- 
thing?” 

“Only a bushelful of things 
that seem to mean nothing,” said 
Smirnov sadly. 

“Item. Why in Hungarian dic- 
tionary-encyclopedias of a cer- 

126 



tain period, is there padding be- 
tween the words Sik and Sikam- 
los?” Epiktistes asked. 

“I follow your thought, 
Epikt,” Glasser agreed. “That 
could be a clue to something. If 
the idea and the name of some- 
thing were expunged from every 
reference, then, in all original 
editions, other subjects on the 
same page would have to be 
padded slightly or another sub- 
ject set in. This filling might be 
hurried, and therefore of an in- 
ferior quality. So, who knows a 
word that is no longer used and 
that comes between Sik and Sik- 
amlos? If we knew the word 
would we know what it meant? 
And would it help us if we did?” 

tcTtem. Why is the young of a 
bear now referred to as a 
pup when once it may have been 
known as a cube?” Epikt issued. 

“I’ve never heard the young of 
a bear referred to as a cube,” 
Shiplap protested. 

“Epikt has come on that by 
our omission-appraisal method,” 
Smirnov explained. “There is 
probably an imperfect erasure 
working. I believe that cube is a 
distortion of a word that has 
somehow been forced out of folk 
memory. Epikt has this clue from 
a ballad which I believe is far re- 
moved from the main suppres- 
sion or it would not have survived 
in even this distorted form.”

“Item. Why is the awkward 
word Coronal used for the sim- 
ple doubling or return of a 
rope? Why is not a simpler 
word used?” Bpikt asked. 

“Has Epikt considered that 
seamen have always used odd 
terms and that landsmen often 
adopt them?” Cogsworth asked. 

“Naturally — Epikt always 
considers everything,” Smirnov 
answered. “He has thousands of 
these items now, and he believes 
that he will be able to put them 
into a pattern.” 

“Item. Why is there a great 
hiatus in period jazz. It’s as 
though a great hunk of it had 
been yanked out by the roots, in 
the words of one Benny B-Flat.” 
“Smirnov, I know that your 
machine has unusual talents,” 
said Glasser, “but if he can tie 
these things together he’s a con- 
catenated genius.” 

“Or a cantankerous clown,” 
Smirnov said. “I know that he 
has to have some emotional re- 
lease from the stress of his work, 
but he often overdoes it with hu- 
mor and drollery.” 

“Item. Why is reference to the 
Amerindian peace-pipe avoided 
as though some obscenity were 
attached to it, and none is dis- 
coverable?” 

“That’s a new one while we’re 
standing here,” said Smir- 
nov. “He’s accumulating quite a 
few of them.” 



“Item. Why is—?” Epikt 
started. 

“Oh, shut up and get back to 
work,” Smirnov ordered his ma- 
chine. “Let’s leave him with it 
until tomorrow, folks. It may be- 
gin to pull together by then,” 
said Smirnov, stalking off. 

“Going to be real big,” Epik- 
tistes issued to them after his 
boss man had left. “Boys and 
girls, it’s going to be real big.” 

T^he next day they combined 
the meeting around the ma- 
chine with a party for Shiplap. 
Aloysius Shiplap had grown — 
for the first time ever, anywhere 
— left-handed grass. It was not 
called that because it whorled to 
the left, but because the organic 
constitutents of it were reversed 
in their construction. Left-hand- 
ed minerals had been construct- 
ed long since, and perhaps they 
also occurred in nature. Left- 
handed bacteria and broths were 
long known, but nobody else had 
ever grown anything as complex 
as left-handed grass. 

“In everything, its effect is re- 
versed,” Shiplap explained. 
“Cattle pastured on this would 
lose rather than gain weight. If 
there ever develops a market for 
really skinny cattle I’ll be wait- 
ing for it.” 

They tossed off a good bit of 
Tosher’s Gin as they got into 
the celebration. Tosher’s is the 

127 



WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT TOWN? 



only drink that will buzz up 
both humans and Ktistec ma- 
chines. There is a flavoring used 
in Tosher’s that gets machines 
high. The alcohol in it some- 
times has a similar effect on hu- 
mans. 

Epiktistes got as mellow as a 
Pottawattamie County pump- 
kin. Ktistec machines are like 
the Irish and the Indians. They 
start unwinding when the gin 
begins to flow. Their behavior 
could become quite wild unless 
carefully watched. 

And the Institute people were 
also having a good time. 

“I wouldn’t have him any oth- 
er way,” said Smirnov. “When 
he relaxes, he relaxes all over the 
place. Hawkin’s machine literal- 
ly bites people when it’s frus- 
trated by a difficult problem. 
Drexel’s smaller machine comes 
all apart throwing arc-snuffers 
and solenoids and is mighty dan- 
gerous to be around. There are 
worse sorts than the clown of a 
machine I have — though he 
does get pretty slushy when he’s 
in his cups.” 

Valery Mok had gathered up 
a bunch of Epiktistes’ utterances 
and slipped them into cocktail 
cookies. Glasser, eating one, 
chewed on a bit of the metallic 
tape. He pulled it, slithering, off 
his tongue, and read — 

“Item. What was the myster- 
ious name written by a deaf 

128 



moron on the wall of the men’s 
room in an institution in Vinita, 
Oklahoma?” 

Epiktistes giggled, though the 
item may have been serious 
when he issued it. 

Cogsworth pulled one out of 
his mouth, stripping the crumbs 
from it with his tongue as it 
came. 

“Item. Why does Petit La- 
rousse take five lines too many 
to say almost nothing about the 
ancient Chibcha Indians of Co- 
lumbia?” 

At this point Valery went in- 
to her high laugh that would 
even make the alphabet sound 
funny. 

j^hiplap pulled one out of his 
grinning mouth, and it seem- 
ed an extension of his grin as it 
came. 

“Item,” he read. “What is 
there about the Great Blue Is- 
land Swamp that puzzles Geolo- 
gists? Or — in the old by-lining 
manner — how recent is re- 
cent?” 

Tosher’s is giggle juice. Glass- 
er’s laughter sounded like a 
string of fire-crackers going off. 

Smirnov extracted the utter- 
ance from his cookie in the lord- 
ly manner. He read the utter- 
ance as though it were of ex- 
treme importance — and it was. 

“Item. What peculiarity is al- 
most revealed by the faded paint 



GALAXY 



of old Rock Island and Pacific 
Railroad box-cars?” 

“Oh, stop giggling, Epikt, it 
isn’t as funny as that!” 

“It is, it is!” bubbled Valery. 
Then she nearly choked bring- 
ing out from her own cookie a 
very long tape, and she read it 
with a very gay voice: 

“Item. Why, when the grue- 
some Little Willy verses were re- 
vived among sub-teen-agers in 
the early nineteen- eighties, were 
they concerned almost entirely 
with chewing gum? In their 
Australian and British home- 
lands six decades before they 
were concerned with everything. 
But here we have gruesome 
verses about forty-nine different 
flavors of gum. As for instance, 

Little Willy mixed his gum 
with bits of Baby’s cerebrum 
and Papa’s blood for Juicy 
Fruit. 

Mother said, “Or, Will, don’t 
duit.” 

“I’d think it would give too 
high a flavor to the gum,” said 

Glasser. 

It’s a lot of fun to open cock- 
tail cookies and read out utter- 
ances of a Ktistec machine. The 
Institute staff generated a bunch 
of what we can only call merri- 
ment. But they were busy people, 
and the party had to come to an 
end. Epiktistes issued a verse as 
they prepared to leave. 



When the world’s last Tosher’s 
is drunken, 

and the world’s last item has 
flewn, 

and the Institute people are 
stunken, 

and Epikt is high as the — 

And there he stuck! Eight 
million billion billion memory 
contacts he had in him, and he 
couldn’t come up with a rime 
for flewn. 

“How many items have you 
really gathered, Epikt?” Glasser 
asked as they began to break up. 

“Millions of them, bub, mil- 
lions of them.” 

“No. Actually he has about 
three-quarters of a million that 
he believes he can tie together,” 
Smirnov explained. “I feel that 
he’ll bring them into a pattern, 
but I’m afraid that it will be a 
facetious one.” 

“Epikt, you cute cubicle, will 
you be able to give us any idea 
of what to look for by tomor- 
row?” Valery asked. 

“Boys and girls, I’ll have it all 
wrapped up and on display for 
you tomorrow,” Epiktistes is- 
sued. “I’ll even be able to tell 
you what the thing smelled like.” 

T? xpectation ran high among 
■*~ J the people of the Institute. 
Epiktistes wanted to have the 
reporters in, but Smirnov said 
no. He didn’t trust his machine. 
Epikt was a cube twenty meters 



WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT TOWN?

on a side; and of his thousands 
of eyes, some of them always 
seemed to be laughing at his 

master. 

“It won’t be a hoax?” Smir- 
nov asked his machine appre- 
hensively. 

“Boss, did I ever hoax you?” 
Epikt issued. 

“Yes.” 

“Boss, some things are best 
presented in the guise of a hoax, 
but underneath this won’t be 
one.” 

It was a crooked-tongued ma- 
chine sometimes, and Smirnov 
was more apprehensive than 
ever. 

The next day everyone gath- 
ered early to hear what Epikt 
had to say. They pulled up 
chairs and recording canisters 
and waited for the machine to 
begin. 

“Ladies, gentlemen, asso- 
ciates,” said Epikt solemnly, “we 
are gathered together to hear of 
an important matter. I will pre- 
sent it as well as I am able. 
There will be disbelief, I know, 
but I am sure of my facts. Make 
yourselves comfortable.” He 
paused and then as an after- 
thought added — “You may 
smoke.” 

“You clanking cubicle, don’t 
tell us what we may do,” Smir- 
nov screamed. “You’re only a 
machine that I made.” 

“You and three thousand oth- 



er workers,” issued Epikt, with- 
out blinking an eye, “and in the 
final stages, the important stages, 
I directed my own assembly. I 
could not have happened other- 
wise. Only I know what is in me. 
As to my own abilities — ” 

“Get on with it, Epikt,” Smir- 
nov ordered, “and try to avoid 
the didactic manner.” 

“Then to get to the point — 
in the year 1980, the largest City 
of the American Midland was 
destroyed by an unnatural disas- 
ter.” 

“That was only twenty years 
ago,” Glasser cut in. “It seems 
that someone would have heard 
of it.” 

“I wonder if St. Louis knew 
that she was destroyed,” Valery 
ventured. “She acts as though 
she thought that she were still 
there.” 

“St. Louis was not the City,” 
issued Epikt. “This destruction 
of a metropolitan area of seven 
million persons in much less 
than seven seconds was a great 
horror from the human view- 
point — come to think of it I 
now recall being a little dis- 
turbed by it myself. The thing 
was so fearful that it was de- 
cided to suppress the whole busi- 
ness and blissfully forget about 
it.” 

“Wouldn’t that be a little dif- 
ficult?” said Aloysius Shiplap 
sarcastically. 



130 



GALAXY 



<tTt was very difficult to do,” 
issued Epikt, “and yet it was 
done, completely, within twenty 
hours. And from that moment 
until this, nobody has remem- 
bered or thought about it at all.” 

“And if Your Whimsical 
Highness will just explain how 
this was done?” Smirnov chal- 
lenged his machine. 

“I’ll explain as well as I can, 
good master. The project was 
put in charge of a master scien- 
tist who shall be nameless — but 
only for a few minutes.” 

“How were the written refer- 
ences of a metropolis of seven 
million persons obliterated?” ask- 
ed Cogs worth. 

“By a device then newly in- 
vented by our master scientist,” 
Epikt answered. “It was known 
as the Tele - Pantographic Dis- 
torter. Even I from this distance 
of time and through the cloud 
of induced amnesia, cannot un- 
derstand how it worked. But it 
did work, and it simultaneously 
destroyed all printed references 
to our subject. This left holes in 
the references, and the flow of 
matter to fill those holes was 
sometimes of inferior texture, as 
I have noted. Holographic — 
that is handwritten, for you, Va- 
lery — references were more 
difficult. Most were simply des- 
troyed In more importent doc- 
ument., the text was flowed in 
automatic writing to fill the 



hole, and in close imitation of 
the original handwriting. But 
these imitations were often im- 
perfect. I have a few thousand 
instances of this. But the Tele- 
Pantographic Distorter was a 
truly remarkable machine, and I 
regret that it is now out of use.” 
“Kindly explain what hap- 
pened to this remarkable ma- 
chine,” said Smirnov. 

“Oh, it’s still here in the In- 
stitute. You stumble into it a 
dozen times a day, good master, 
and you curse it as ‘That Dam- 
nable Pile of Junk.’ ” issued 
Epikt. “But you have a block, 
that will not allow you to re- 
member what it is.” 

“I believe that I have been 
stumbling into such a pile of 
junk for many years,” mused 
Smirnov. “Several times I have 
almost permitted myself to won- 
der what it was.” 

“And you invented it. The 
master scientist of the memory- 
obliteration was yourself, Greg- 
ory Smirnov.” 

“Hog hang it, Epikt! Your 
jug will leak!” protested Ship- 
lap. “How of the human memo- 
ries? The seven million inhabi- 
tants of the city would have had 
relatives of at least an equal 
number elsewhere. Didn’t they 
wonder about their mothers or 
children or brothers and sis- 
ters?” 

“They sorrowed, but they 

131 



WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT TOWN? 



didn’t wonder,” issued Epikt. “It 
was a sorrow to which they 
could give no name. Examine 
the period and see how many 
really sad songs were popular in 
the years 1980 and 1981. But 
broadcast euphoria soon masked 
it over. The human memory of 
the thing was blocked by in- 
duced world amnesia. This was 
done hypnotically over the 
broadcast waves, and over more 
subtle waves Few escaped it. The 
deaf moron mentioned in one of 
my items was one of those few. 
He scrawled the name of the 
town on a wall once, but it 
meant nothing to anyone.” 

“But there would be a hun- 
dred million loose ends to clean 
up,” Glasser protested. 

UD aise that number sever- 
al powers,” issued Epikt. 
“There were very many loose 
ends, and most of them were 
taken care of. I gathered a mil- 
lion or so that remained in the 
process of this study, but they 
could not break through the in- 
duced amnesia. The door was 
bolted on the whole sub- 
ject Then it was double-locked. 
It was necessary to destroy not 
only the memory, but also the 
memory of that memory. Mr. 
Smirnov, in what was perhaps 
his greatest feat, put himself un- 
der the final hypnosis against it. 
It was his job to pull in the hole 



after them all. But it bothered 
him more than others because 
he was more involved in it. After 
this temporary explanation it 
will bother him no more. This 
time he will forget it with a 
clear conscience. 

“He does not recognize or re- 
member it even now. It was his 
intent and triumph that he nev- 
er should. The city and its de- 
struction are forgotten forever, 
but the method of that memory- 
obliteration has only been 
forced to a subliminal level. It 
will be resurrected and used 
again whenever there is a great 
unnatural disaster.” 

“And where in tarnation or 
the American Midlands was this 
city?” Cogsworth hollered. 

“Its site is now known as the 
Great Blue Island Swamp,” is- 
sued Epikt. 

“Finish it, you goggle-eyed 
gadget!” S h i p 1 a p shrilled. 
“What’s the name of that town?” 

“Chicago,” issued Epiktistes. 

That broke it! That tore it 
clear up! It was a hoax after all. 
That clattering clown of a cubi- 
cle had led them into it with all 
eyes open. Valery went into her 
high laughter, and her good hus- 
band Cogsworth chortled like 
that gooney bird with the hic- 
cups. 

“Chicago! It sounds like a lit- 
tle zoo beaver sliding down a 
mud slide and hitting the water. 



132 



GALAXY 



Chicago!” It was the funniest 
word Valery had ever heard. 

“Nobody but a machine gone 
comic could coin a name like 
that,” laughed Glasser with his 
fire-cracker laugh. “Chicago!” 

“I take my hat off to you, 
Epiktistes,” said Aloysius Ship- 
lap, “You are a cog-foot- 
ed, tongue - in - cheek tall tale 
teller. People, this machine is 
ripe!” 

“I’m a little disappointed,” 
said Smirnov. “So the mountain 
labored and produced a mouse. 
But did it have to be a wall-eyed 
mouse in a clown suit, Epikt? 
It’s too tall even for a tale. That 
a great city could be completely 
destroyed only twenty years ago 
and we know nothing about it — 
that’s tall enough. But that it 
should have the impossible 
name of Chicago tops it all. If 
you weighed all possible sounds 
— and I’m sure that you did, 
Epikt — you could not come up 
with a more ridiculous sounding 
name than that.” 

tl/^ood people, it is meant 

^ ^to be this way,” issued Ep- 
iktistes. “You cannot remember 
it. You cannot recognize it. And 
when you leave this room you 
will not even be able to recall 
the funny name. You will have 
only the dim impression that the 
clownish machine played a 
clownish trick on you. The di- 



sasters — for I suspect that there 
were several such — are well 
forgotten. The world would lie 
down and die if it remembered 
them too well. 

“And yet there really was a 
large city named Chicago. As 
Sikago it left a hole in one Hun- 
garian dictionary - encyclope- 
dia; and the Petit Larousse had 
to flow French froth about the 
Chibcha Indians into the place 
where Chicago had stood. Some- 
thing, for which I find the ten- 
tative name of Chicago Hot was 
pulled out of the jazz complex 
by the roots. The Calumet River 
had flowed about the City some- 
where, so there came a reluc- 
tance to use that name of the old 
Indian peace-pipe. Chicago was 
a great city. The heart of her 
downtown was known as the 
Loop, and one of her baseball 
teams was named the Cubs. For 
that reason those two words were 
forced out of use. They might be 
evocative.” 

“Loop? Cubs?” giggled Va- 
lery. “Those words are almost as 
funny as Chicago. How do you 
make them up, Epikt?” 

“In popular capsule impres- 
sion Chicago was the chewing- 
gum capital of the world. The 
leader in this manufacture was 
a man named — as well as I can 
reconstruct it Wiggly. Child- 
dren somehow found the echos 
of the gruesome destruction of 



WHAT'S THE NAME OF THAT TOWN? 



133 



Chicago and tied it in with this 
capsule impression to produce the 
bloody Little Willy verses about 
chewing gum.” 

“Epikt, you top yourself,” said 
Shiplap, “if anything could top 
an invention as funny as Chica- 
go.” 

“Good people, it comes down 
over you like a curtain,” issued 
Epiktistes. “You forget again — 
even my joke, even the funny 
name of the town. And, more to 
the point, I forget also. 

“It’s gone Gone. All gone. 
How peculiar! It is a long blank 
tape you all stare at as though 
you were under hypnosis. I must 
have suffered a black-out. I nev- 
er issued a blank tape before. 
Smirnov, I have the taste in my 
terminals of an experiment that 
didn’t quite come off. Feed me 
another. I don’t fail often.” 

tt'T^hat is enough for today, 
& Epiktistes. We are all 
sleepy for some reason. No it 
didn’t work out — whatever it 
was. I forget what it was that we 
were working on. It doesn’t mat- 



ter. Our failures are well forgot. 
We’ll hit on something else. 
We’re working on a lot of 
things.” 

Then they all shuffled out 
sleepily and went back to their 
work. Smirnov’s machine had 
busted on something or other, 
but it was a good machine and 
would hit the next time, of that 
they were sure. 

In a corridor, Smirnov stum- 
bled into his old Tele-Pantogra- 
phic Distorter. He had been 
stumbling unseeing into it every 
day for twenty years. 

The machine rolled nine 
banks of eyes at Smirnov and 
smiled willingly. Was it another 
of those disasters? Was there 
any deep work to be done? Tele- 
Pan was ready. But no. Smirnov 
passed on. The machine smiled 
again and went peacefully back 
to sleep. 

“That damnable piece of 
junk,” Smirnov growled, walk- 
ing along and petting his sore 
shin. “I feel almost as if I were 
on the verge of wondering what 
it is.” — R. A. LAFFERTY

by EDGAR PANGBORN 



MAXWELL’S 

MONKEY 

They weren't shadows — exactly. 
They also weren't human. They 
were, in fact, our consciences! 



\ shadow maybe. But now 
and then it went off to do 
something or get something, and 
came back into some slightly 
different position looking like a 
damn fool. 

Maxwell saw it first on waking 
after a binge. During the eve- 
ning’s riot he had insulted his two 
dearest friends — the husband 
saw him home anyhow — and 
knocked over a baby-carriage. It 
had no baby in it, but Maxwell 
reflected it might have had, and 
wept. Then he was trying to pick 
a policeman’s pocket and lamen- 
tably failing. He heard his friend 
explain: “Always does that, Of- 
ficer. It don’t mean a thing.” But 
why would anyone go to the 



trouble of picking a policeman’s 
pocket unless he meant some- 
thing by it? And in the hurting 
morning light, the monkey sat 
on the foot of his bed. 

He threw a pillow. 

The pillow went through, un- 
reasonably slowed down. You 
don’t expect an object passing 
through a ghost to lose momen- 
tum. Maxwell said: “You are a 
semi-hallucinatory precipitation 
of gaseous particules, or a thing 
from outer space. Under either 
interpretation, your invasion of 
my domicile constitutes a tort.” 
Maxwell was the most junior 
partner in the law firm of Bindle, 
Bindle, Bindle and Maxwell. 
“Get down off my bed.” 



135 



The monkey did so, tossed the 
pillow up on the covers, and re- 
sumed its earlier position. 

“I see,” said Maxwell. “You 
understand speech, you manipu- 
late material objects although 
they don’t necessarily manipu- 
late you, and you prefer the let- 
ter to the spirit. Please get me 
an aspirin.” 

The monkey just sat there. It 
was black, tailless, the size of 
an Airedale, male. So far as Max- 
well could tell it was young and 
healthy like himself, but prob- 
ably not hung over. 

Maxwell reeled to the bath- 
room. The monkey paralleled 
his movements, just out of reach 
— not that Maxwell felt much 
desire to grab. Maxwell washed 
down two aspirins. “Want one?” 
The monkey nodded, caught the 
tablet, and waited for Maxwell 
to get out of the bathroom and 
give him room. Maxwell removed 
the key and stood aside; the 
monkey entered; Maxwell sighed 
and locked him in. 

The monkey returned through 
the keyhole and settled back 
into its normal shape, rumpled, 
irritated, and larger than before. 
“So you were hung over,” said 
Maxwell, getting dressed. The 
monkey ignored that, imitating 
Maxwell’s motions with the 
shirt. Since it had no clothes of 
its own and showed no inclina- 
tion to steal Maxwell’s, this ap- 



peared an empty ritual — shad- 
ow work. 

For breakfast, Maxwell tossed 
the monkey some actual burned 
toast, but wasn’t about to pour 
any extra coffee until the brute 
got a cup for himself and set it 
down within Maxwell’s reach, 
looking miserable. Maxwell wash- 
ed up, the monkey making 
theoretical motions at a safe dis- 
tance from the tangible sink. 
Phony-casual, Maxwell asked; 
“By the way, how would you 
have proceeded if that bathroom 
door had had no keyhole? Or, 
say, a Yale lock?” 

The monkey replied only by 
looking grave, which was the way 
he looked anyhow. 

A T axwell could not avoid go- 
-L’-Mng to the office. As the 
most junior partner, he was ex- 
pected to sweat out a serious 
quantity of dogwork to justify 
his existence in what the most 
senior Bindle described (often) 
as a situation of substantial 
trust. He told the monkey; “I 
am now about to go downstairs, 
out, and five stations uptown on 
the subway. I then walk from 
Lexington to Third and uptown 
two more blocks; elevator from 
main to ninth floor. Any com- 
ment? . No comment.” 

He stepped out, quickly clos- 
ing the apartment door, which 
had a Yale lock. 



136 



GALAXY 



A block from the subway en- 
trance the monkey caught up 
with him. 

It had enlarged again, being 
now as tall as Maxwell, and was 
rubbing its left hip as if it might 
be a bit lame, and glowering. 

It was one of those lush and 
tender mornings in May when 
New Yorkers find it a genuine 
pleasure to inhale grit. Those 
who passed Maxwell and his 
associate paid the monkey no 
more attention than they would 
have given to any offbeat shad- 
ow. Faint frowns, puzzled 
glances. One elderly lady opened 
her mouth but didn’t speak. 
Politeness, Maxwell supposed. 
Nobody likes to stop a stranger 
and say: “Excuse me, sir, you 
may not have noticed — your 
shadow is looking more simian 
than you do this morning.” 

Or perhaps the monkey knew 
some extra-terrestrial means of 
co-operating with Maxwell’s wish 
for obscurity. Decent of him to 
use it, if so. Descending the sub- 
way steps, Maxwell said over his 
shoulder: “Sorry about all those 
doors.” 

Understandably, the monkey 
went unnoticed in the subway 
crowds. At the moment of Max- 
well’s apology it had returned to 
the size of a child, and quit glow- 
ering. 

At the office Maxwell hung up 
his hat in his own small room, 



leaving the door open for his 
usual early morning contempla- 
tion of the back of Sheila Walk- 
er’s neck. 

/fiss Walker at twenty-nine 
JVi. was losing hope, but the 
back of her neck was exquisite. 

She did not lack other pret- 
tiness of a spaniel-eyed, wistful 
sort. Though a competent recep- 
tionist and secretary to all four 
partners, she was developing a 
tendency to flutter and squeak. 
She recognized it herself with 
honest dismay. She also found 

herself clutching her mousy hair 

at demoralizing sounds, such as 
the long angry bray of H. K. 
Bindle clearing his throat for 

speech. This uproar was no 

worse than T. J. Bindle’s sneeze, 
and F. W. Bindle, while dictat- 
ing, scratched his left trouser-leg 
with dull sonority; so Miss Wal- 
ker sometimes clutched her hair 
at all three. Pretty, Shelia at 
times became beautiful, when no- 
body was looking at her and she 
was looking at the back of Max- 
well’s neck. The back of Max- 
well’s neck was not exquisite ; 
occasionally not even very clean. 

When she noticed Maxwell’s 
monkey following him into the 
office that morning she felt that 
to speak of it would be not only 
tactless but — well, difficult. She 
said: “Good morning, Max!” and 
smiled spaniel-eyed, slamming 



MAXWELL'S MONKEY 



137 



the typewriter carriage back and 
savoring the baritone boom of 
his “Yo, Sheila!” She too had 
gone through a bad time since 
waking — had indeed thought 
of talking things over with a 
well-heeled friend of hers who 
was just about halfway through 
her third psychoanalyst. 

After Maxwell settled in his 
office, with the door open, she 
continued tearing away at a 
brief in the suit of one Jasper 
Baring against his grand-nephew 
Judson Baer for defamation of 
character. The said Judson Baer 
was alleged to have asserted 
loudly in a public place, to wit 
a bar, before six persons bearing 
witness, that the said Jasper 
Baring was not fit to carry guts 
to a bear. Her exquisite neck 
grew warmer and warmer up over 
the ears, and she got things all 
snarled up. 

When she could bear it no 
longer, Sheila flung down her 
eraser and bravely stepped into 
Maxwell’s office to ask him — 
flat-out, quickly, before her 
courage faded — how you spell 
“eligible.” “I keep thinking it’s 
two es, somewhere, but it never 
comes out looking right!” 

“Mm, well, what’s the con- 
text?” Maxwell asked — not in- 
telligently, mostly in order to 
keep her in the office while he 
made up his mind about some- 
thing. 



“Well, it’s what this old Jas- 
per said about Jud — no, Jud- 
son about Jasper — wait, I’ll get 
it, Max.” 

\ s she fluttered back to her 
desk, Maxwell was forced to 
abandon his last doubt. He was 
not even slightly hung over, and 
there were two monkeys in the 
room. His own, and the one 
standing in the doorway behind 
Sheila making desperate motions 
with imaginary papers. 

Maxwell’s monkey seemed to 
be more or less off duty, per- 
haps because Maxwell’s desk 
chair stood close to the wall, 
which cramps the style of any 
shadow. Maxwell’s monkey was 
in fact deeply interested in the 
other one. They were about the 
same size — quite a nice match, 
in a way. 

“Here it is,” said Sheila, flut- 
tering back. “You see, H. K. felt 
we should have like a legal 
translation of what this old Jud- 
son said about — wait — ‘being 
then and there at the site known 
as’ — no, it’s further on — here: 
‘defendant having then and there 
uttered expressions including the 
direct statement that plaintiff 
was not qualified or eligible to 
initiate or promote or perform 
the conveyance or transport of 
eviscerated material, to wit en- 
trails’ — oh, look how I spelled 
evis — oh — oh, damn!”

GALAXY 



“You poor kid,” said Maxwell, 
and made it around his desk 
fairly fast, heedless of the flying 
pages of legal size. 

The first kiss, intended partly 
as a consolation job, bounced 
off her nose. The second, even 
more complexly motivated, was 
amateur in execution but far 
more advanced in concept. 

The monkeys too appeared to 
feel that at least one crisis in 
their own relations had been met 
and passed. 

During those five or ten min- 
utes — (this anyhow was the 
none too clear impression of both 
Shelia and Maxwell) — three 
persons passed the office door: 
F. W. Bindle, who seemed to 
note the embrace with mixed 
feelings, some of them green; F. 
W.’s father T. J. Bindle, who 
leered in a manner that could 
hardly be interpreted to mean 
anything but “Nice work Max!” 
and the most senior H. K. Bindle, 
who always noted everything that 
happened, but never said any- 
thing unless it could be express- 
ed in sentences of not less than 
two hundred and fifty words. 

A crisis passed usually means 
-**• another one approached. A 
week after his monkey’s first ap- 
pearance Maxwell came to see 
me, not so much distressed as 
puzzled, not so much puzzled as 
angry. It took time and bourbon 



before he could work off those 
feelings of hostility and resent- 
ment which they say we should 
work off, no kidding. 

He told his story coherently. 
As he talked and drank and 
brooded, his shadow was more 
disturbed than he was, but I 
could not reach any firm con- 
clusion about it. 

It has been suggested that 
they possess some means — pos- 
sibly a ray, though I don’t buy 
that — of unsettling the obser- 
ver’s vision at its source. I did 
feel inclined to fault my own 
visual perception, when Max- 
well’s shadow strolled off to the 
bathroom and Maxwell just sat 
there. 

“We’ve checked out one thing 
for sure,” he said. “It won’t let 
you do anything you yourself 
think is wrong. I mean, it’ll let 
you all right, but it gets bigger 
and meaner and uglier till a man 
can’t stand it. But it goes by 
what you think, not by any other 
standards. Take cussing. I can’t 
see anything wrong about a bit 
of normal cussing, so when I do 
it my monkey doesn’t give a 
damn. But Sheila’s got a thing 
about cussing, her own that is. 
Last time she let go with a little 
‘hell’ or something — and with 
every provocation, mind you — 
a couple of other words came 
along for the ride, and her mon- 
key — my God, I don’t care to

see that again! Sheila nearly 
passed out cold.” 

“You say there’s been this — 
gradual growth?” 

“All week long. If only you 
damn science-fiction writers 
would just — ” 

“Let’s stay with the subject. 
Approximately how large is your 
shad — your monkey, right this 
moment?” 

“Can’t you see?” 

“Not too clearly, I admit. 
(Cheers.)” 

“That’s evident. (What? Oh, 
cheers.) Why, he’s about two 
gorillas’ worth and uglier than 
dammit.” 

“And Sheila’s?” 

“Size of her maternal grand- 
mother, approximately.” 

“Her maternal grandmother 
was — ” 

“Is. Stout. About medium- 
large grizzly size.” 

“And you feel that your con- 
duct this week — ” 

“We’ve been good as gold. If 
you confounded science-fiction 
writers would — ” 

“Max, now hear this : we didn’t 
invent outer space. It has been 
there all the time, and bugs me 
as much as you. Please stick to 
the subject.” 

“Sure, sure, that’s how a man 
talks when he doesn’t happen 
to have a monkey. Oh, well, we 
drove out across the river the 
other night and parked, and I 



admit my feelings ran away with 
me. Sheila’s too I guess. But she 
said no, and — well, see, the 
monks had gone outside. No 
room for ’em on the back seat 
any more, they’ve grown so. And 
they were hulking around out 
there in the dark, and there’s 
this sudden God-awful pounding 
on the top of the car as though 
some lunatic — ” 

“By which monkey was the 
pounding?” 

“Sheila’s. I stuck my head out 
and saw her. Eyes glow in the 
dark, damned if they don’t. Com- 
ing home they rode outside on 
the roof, and we could see their 
feet stuck down through the rear 
windows, I suppose to keep the 
wind from blowing them away. 
If only it could!” 

“The pounding occurred when 
Sheila said no?” 

“About that time. You see? 
No pleasing them.” 

“In relation to Sheila what did 
you then do, Counselor?” 

“Nothing but nothing, you 
crumb. She said no. If you 
damned science — ” 

“And you claim your own mon- 
key is two gorillas’ worth and 
growing all the time. Max, short 
of rubbing your two stupid noses 
in it, how could they make it 
any plainer?” 

He made a show of thinking 
that over a long while, but the 
truth is that Maxwell is anything 



140

but stupid. He said at last: “See 
what you mean of course. But 
she still says no and she means 
it.” 

I said (and I think well 
enough of the remark so that I 
have it in a notebook and may 
use it again some time) : “Max, 
of the many ways of persuading 
a woman to change her mind, 
sitting on your butt thinking sad 
thoughts is not one.” 

He left soon after that. I no- 
ticed how long it took his shad- 
ow to follow him after he slam- 
med the door. He called me four 
hours later, at two in the morn- 
ing, sounding peaceful and 
friendly. 

All he had to say was: “They 
did too.” 

XT ow that we all have them,

ly — maybe even a little better 
than they used to, as a matter 
of fact.

MAXWELL'S MONKEY 



141 




BY PHIilP K. DICK 



He had helped fa rebuild dying Mars — 
now he could do the same for dead Earth I 



"Delow the ’copter of Milt 
Biskle lay newly fertile 
lands. He had done well with 
his area of Mars, verdant from 
his reconstruction of the ancient 
water - network. Spring, two 
springs each year, had been 
brought to this autumn world of 
sand and hopping toads, a land 
once made of dried soil cracking 
with the dust of former times, of 
a dreary and unwatered waste. 
Victim of the recent Prox-Terra 
conflict. 

Quite soon the first Terran 
emigrants would appear, stake 
their claims and take over. He 
could retire. Perhaps he could 
return to Terra or bring his own 



family here, receive priority of 
land - acquisition — as a recon- 
struct engineer he deserved it. 
Area Yellow had progressed far 
faster than the other engineers’ 
sections. And now his reward 
came. 

Reaching forward, Milt Biskle 
touched the button of his long- 
range transmitter. “This is Re- 
construct Engineer Yellow,” he 
said. “I’d like a psychiatrist. 
Any one will do, so long as he’s 
immediately available.” 

\TS7hen Milt Biskle entered 
the office Dr. DeWinter 
rose and held out his hand. “I’ve 
heard,” Dr. DeWinter said, 



142 



“that you, of all the forty odd 
reconstruct engineers, have been 
the most creative. It’s no wonder 
you’re tired. Even God had to 
rest after six days of such work, 
and you’ve been at it for years. 
As I was waiting for you to 
reach me I received a news 
memo from Terra that will in- 
terest you.” He picked the memo 
up from his desk. “The initial 
transport of settlers is about to 
arrive here on Mars . and 
they’ll go directly into your area. 
Congratulations, Mr. Biskle.” 
Rousing himself Milt Biskle 
said, “What if I returned to 
Earth?” 

“But if you mean to stake a 
claim for your family, here — ” 
Milt Biskle said, “I want you 
to do something for me. I feel 
too tired, too — ” He gestured. 
“Or depressed, maybe. Anyhow 
I’d like you to make arrange- 
ments for my gear, including my 
wug-plant, to be put aboard a 
transport returning to Terra.” 
“Six years of work,” Dr. De- 
Winter said. “And now you’re 
abandoning your recompense. 
Recently I visited Earth and it’s 
just as you remember — ” 

“How do you know how I re- 
member it?” 

“Rather,” DeWinter corrected 
himself smoothly, “I should say 
it’s just as it was. Overcrowded, 
tiny conapts with seven families 
to a single cramped kitchen. Au- 



tobahns so crowded you can’t 
make a move until eleven in the 
morning.” 

“For me,” Milt Biskle said, 
“the overcrowding will be a re- 
lief after six years of robot auto- 
nomic equipment.” He had made 
up his mind. In spite of what he 
had accomplished here, or per- 
haps because of it, he intended 
to go home. Despite the psychi- 
atrist’s arguments. 

Dr. DeWinter purred, “What 
if your wife and children, Milt, 
are among the passengers of 
this first transport?” Once more 
he lifted a document from his 
neatly-arranged desk. He studied 
the paper, then said, “Biskle, 
Fay, Mrs. Laura C. June C. 
Woman and two girl children. 
Your family?” 

“Yes,” Milt Biskle admitted 
woodenly; he stared straight 
ahead. 

“So you see you can’t head 
back to Earth. Put on your hair 
and prepare to meet them at 
Field Three. And exchange your 
teeth. You’ve got the stainless 
steel ones in, at the moment.” 

Chagrined, Biskle nodded. 
Like all Terrans he had lost his 
hair and teeth from the fallout 
during the war. For everyday 
service in his lonely job of re- 
reconstructing Yellow Area 
of Mars he made no use of the 
expensive wig which he had 
brought from Terra, and as to 



PRECIOUS ARTIFACT 



143 



the teeth he personally found 
the steel ones far more comfor- 
table than the natural - color 
plastic set. It indicated how far 
he had drifted from social inter- 
action. He felt vaguely guilty; 
Dr. DeWinter was right. 

But he had felt guilty ever 
since the defeat of the Proxmen. 
The war had embittered him; it 
didn’t seem fair that one of the 
twc competing cultures would 
have to suffer, since the needs of 
both were legitimate. 

Mars itself had been the locus 
of contention. Both cultures 
needed it as a colony on which 
to deposit surplus populations. 
Thank God Terra had managed 
to gain tactical mastery during 
the last year of the war . hence 
it was Terrans such as himself, 
and not Proxmen, patching up 
Mars. 

“By the way,” Dr. DeWinter 
said. “I happen to know of your 
intentions regarding your fel- 
low reconstruct engineers.” 

M nt , Biskle glanced up swift- 

“As a matter of fact,” De Win- 
ter said, “we know they’re at this 
moment gathering in Red Area 
to hear your account.” Opening 
his desk drawer he got out a yo- 
yo, stood up and began to oper- 
ate it expertly doing walking the 
dog. “Your panic - stricken 
speech to the effect that some- 



thing is wrong, although you 
can’t seem to say just what it 
might be.” 

Watching the yo-yo Biskle 
said, “That’s a toy popular in the 
Prox system. At least so I read 
in a homeopape article, once.” 

“Hmm. I understood it origi- 
nated in the Philippines.” En- 
grossed, Dr. DeWinter now did 
around the world. He did it well. 
“I’m taking the liberty of send- 
ing a deposition to the recon- 
struct engineers’ gathering, testi- 
fying to your mental condition. 
It will be read aloud, — sorry to 
say.” 

“I still intend to address the 
gathering,” Eiskle said. 

“Well, then there’s a compro- 
mise that occurs to me. Greet 
your little family when it ar- 
rives here on Mars and then 
we’ll arrange a trip to Terra for 
you. At our expense. And in ex- 
change you’ll agree not to ad- 
dress the gathering of recon- 
struct engineers or burden them 
in any way with your nebulous 
forebodings.” DeWinter eyed 
him keenly. “After all, this is a 
critical moment. The first emi- 
grants are arriving. We don’t 
want trouble; we don’t want to 
make anyone uneasy.” 

“Would you do me a favor?” 
Biskle asked. “Show me that 
you’ve got a wig on. And that 
your teeth are false. Just so I can 
be sure that you’re a Terran.” 



144 



GALAXY 



Dr. DeWinter tilted his wig 
and plucked out his set of false 
teeth. 

“I’ll take the offer,” Milt Bis- 
kle said. “If you’ll agree to make 
certain that my wife obtains the 
parcel of land I set aside for 
her.” 

Nodding, DeWinter tossed 
him a small white envelope. 
“Here’s your ticket. Round trip, 
of course, since you’ll be coming 
back.” 

I hope so, Biskle thought as 
he picked up the ticket. But it 
depends on what I see on Terra. 
Or rather on what they let me 
see. 

He had a feeling they’d let 
him see very little. In fact as lit- 
tle as Proxmanly possible. 

W^en his ship reached 
Terra a smartly uniformed 
guide waited for him. “Mr. Bis- 
kle?’’ Trim and attractive and 
exceedingly young she stepped 
forward alertly. “I’m Mary 
Ableseth, your Tourplan com- 
panion. I’ll show you around the 
planet during your brief stay 
here.” She smiled brightly and 
very professionally. He was tak- 
en aback. “I’ll be with you con- 
stantly, night and day.” 

“Night, too?” he managed to 
say. 

“Yes. Mr. Biskle. That’s my 
job. We expect you to be disor- 
iented due to your years of labor 



on Mars . labor we of Terra 
applaud and honor, as is right.” 
She fell in beside him, steering 
him toward a parked ’copter. 
“Where would you like to go 
first? New York City? Broad- 
way? To the night clubs and 
theaters and restaurants. .” 

“No, to Central Park. To sit 
on a bench.” 

“But there is no more Central 
Park, Mr. Biskle. It was turned 
into a parking lot for govern- 
ment employees while you were 
on Mars.” 

“I see,” Milt Biskle said 
“Well, then Portsmouth Square 
in San Francisco will do.” He 
opened the door of the ’copter. 

“That, too, has become a park- 
ing lot,” Miss Ableseth said, 
with a sad shake of her long, lu- 
minous red hair. “We’re so dam 
overpopulated. Try again. Mr. 
Biskle; there are a few parks 
left, one in Kansas, I believe, 
and two in Utah in the south 
part near St. George.” 

“This is bad news,” Milt said. 
“May I stop at that ampheta- 
mine dispenser and put in my 
dime? I need a stimulant to 
cheer me up.” 

“Certainly,” Miss Ableseth 
said, nodding graciously. 

Milt Biskle walked to the 
spaceport’s nearby stimulant 
dispenser, reached into his 
pocket, found a dime, and 
dropped the dime in the slot. 



PRECIOUS ARTIFACT 



145 



The dime fell completely 
through the dispenser and 
bounced .onto the pavement. 

“Odd,” Biskle said, puzzled. 

“I think I can explain that,” 
Miss Ableseth said. “That dime 
of yours is a Martian dime, made 
for a lighter gravity.” 

“Hmm,” Milt Biskle said, as 
he retrived the dime. As Miss 
Ableseth had predicted he felt 
disoriented. He stood by as she 
put in a dime of her own and 
obtained the small tube of am- 
phetamine stimulants for him. 
Certainly her explanation 
seemed adequate. But — 

“It is now eight p.m. local 
time,” Miss Ableseth said. “And 
I haven’t had dinner, although 
of course you have, aboard your 
ship. Why not take me to din- 
ner? We can talk over a bottle 
of Pinot Noir and you can tell 
me these vague forebodings 
which have brought you to Ter- 
ra, that something dire is wrong 
and that all your marvelous re- 
construct work is pointless. I’d 
adore to hear about it.” She 
guided him back to the ’copter 
and the two of them entered, 
squeezing into the back seat to- 
gether. Milt Biskle found her to 
be warm and yielding, decidedly 
Terran; he became embarrassed 
and felt his heart pounding in 
effort-syndrome. It had been 
some time since he had been this 
close to a woman. 



CCT isten,” he said, as the 
-*-j automatic circuit of the 
’copter caused it to rise from the 
spaceport parking lot, “I’m mar- 
ried. I’ve got two children and 
I came here on business. I’m on 
Terra to prove that the Proxmen 
really won and that we few re- 
maining Terrans are slaves of 
the Prox authorities, laboring 
for — ” He gave up; it was hope- 
less. Miss Ableseth remained 
pressed against him. 

“You really think,” Miss Able- 
seth said presently, as the ’cop- 
ter passed above New York City, 
“that I’m a Prox agent?” 

“N-no,” Milt Biskle said. “I 
guess not.” It did not seem like- 
ly, under the circumstances. 

“While you’re on Terra,” Miss 
Ableseth said, “why stay in an 
over-crowded, noisy hotel? Why 
not stay with me at my conapt 
in New Jersey? There’s plenty of 
room and you’re more than wel- 
come.” 

“Okay,” Biskle agreed, feeling 
the futility of arguing. 

“Good.” Miss Ableseth gave 
an instruction to the ’copter; it 
turned north. “We’ll have din- 
ner there. It’ll save money, and 
at all the decent restaurants 
there’s a two-hour line this time 
of night, so it’s almost impossi- 
ble to get a table. You’ve prob- 
ably forgotten. How wonderful 
it’ll be when half our popula- 
tion can emigrate!” 



146 



GALAXY 



“Yes,” Biskle said tightly. 
“And they’ll like Mars; we’ve 
done a good job.” He felt a mea- 
sure of enthusiasm returning to 
him, a sense of pride in the re- 
construct work he and his com- 
patriots had done. “Wait until 
you see it, Miss Ableseth.” 

“Call me Mary,” Miss Able- 
seth said, as she arranged her 
heavy scarlet wig; it had be- 
come dislodged during the last 
few moments in the cramped 
quarters of the ’copter. 

“Okay,” Biskle said, and, ex- 
cept for a nagging awareness of 
disloyalty to Fay, he felt a sense 
of well-being. 

“Things happen fast on Ter- 
ra,” Mary Ableseth said. “Due to 
the terrible pressure of over- 
population.” She pressed her 
teeth in place; they, too, had be- 
come dislodged. 

“So I see,” Milt Biskle agreed, 
and straightened his own wig 
and teeth, too. Could I have been 
mistaken? he asked himself. 
After all he could see the lights 
of New York below; Terra was 
decidedly not a depopulated 
ruin and its civilization was in- 
tact. 

Or was this all an illusion, im- 
posed on his percept-system by 
Prox psychiatric techniques un- 
familiar to him? It was a fact 
that his dime had fallen com- 
pletely through the amphe- 
tamine dispenser. Didn’t that in- 



dicate something was subtly, ter- 
ribly wrong? 

Perhaps the dispenser hadn’t 
really been there. 

I'Tphe next day he and Mary 
Ableseth visited one of the 
few remaining parks. In the 
southern part of Utah, near the 
mountains, the park although 
small was bright green and at- 
tractive. Milt Biskle lolled on 
the grass watching a squirrel 
progressing toward a tree in 
wicket-like leaps, its tail flowing 
behind it in a gray stream. 

“No squirrels on Mars,” Milt 
Biskle said sleepily. 

Wearing a slight sunsuit, Mary 
Ableseth stretched out on her 
back, eyes shut. “It’s nice here, 
Milt. I imagine Mars is like 
this.” Beyond the park heavy 
traffic moved along the freeway; 
the noise reminded Milt of the 
surf of the Pacific Ocean. It 
lulled him. All seemed well, and 
he tossed a peanut to the squir- 
rel. The squirrel veered, wicket- 
hopped toward the peanut, its 
intelligent face twitching in re- 
sponse. 

As it sat upright, holding the 
nut, Milt Biskle tossed a second 
nut off to the right. The squir- 
rel heard it land among the ma- 
ple leaves; its ears pricked up, 
and this reminded Milt of a 
game he once had played with a 
cat, an old sleepy tom which had 



PRECIOUS ARTIFACT 



147 



belonged to him and his brother 
in the days before Terra had 
been so overpopulated, when 
pets were still legal. He had wait- 
ed until Pumpkin — the tomcat 
— was almost asleep and then he 
had tossed a small object into 
the corner of the room. Pump- 
kin woke up. His eyes had flown 
open and his ears had pricked, 
turned, and he had sat for fif- 
teen minutes listening and 
watching, brooding as to what 
had made the noise. It was a 
harmless way of teasing the old 
cat, and Milt felt sad, thinking 
how many years Pumpkin had 
been dead, now, his last legal 
pet. On Mars, though, pets would 
be legal again. That cheered 
him. 

In fact on Mars, during his 
years of reconstruct work, he 
had possessed a pet. A Martian 
plant. He had brought it with 
him to Terra and it now stood 
on the living room coffee table 
in Mary Ableseth’s conapt, its 
limbs draped rather unhappily. 
It had not prospered in the un- 
familiar Terran climate. 

“Strange,” Milt murmured, 
“that my wug-plant isn’t thriv- 
ing. I’d have thought in such a 
moist atmosphere . .” 

“It’s the gravity,” Mary said, 
eyes still shut, her bosom rising 
and falling regularly. She was 
almost asleep. “Too much for 
it.” 



Milt regarded the supine form 
of the woman, remembering 
Pumpkin under similar circum- 
stances. The hypnogogic mo- 
ment, between waking and sleep- 
ing, when consciousness and un- 
consciousness became blended 
. reaching, he picked up a 
pebble. 

He tossed the pebble into the 
leaves near Mary’s head. 

At once she sat up, eyes open, 
startled, her sunsuit falling from 
her 

Both her ears pricked up. 

“But we Terrans,” Milt said, 
“have lost control of the muscu- 
lature of our ears, Mary. On 
even a reflex basis.” 

“What?” she murmured, 
blinking in confusion as she re- 
tied her sunsuit. 

“Our ability to prick up our 
ears has atrophied,” Milt ex- 
plained. “Unlike the dog and 
cat. Although to examine us 
morphologically you wouldn’t 
know because the muscles are 
still there. So you made an er- 
ror.” 

“I don’t know what you’re 
talking about,” Mary said, with 
a trace of sullenness. She turned 
her attention entirely to arrang- 
ing the bra of her sunsuit, ignor- 
ing him. 

“Let’s go back to the conapt,” 
Milt said, rising to his feet. He 
no longer felt like lolling in the 
park, because he could no long- 



GALAXY 



er believe in the park. Unreal 
squirrel, unreal grass . was 
it actually? Would they ever 
show him the substance beneath 
the illusion? He doubted it. 

The squirrel followed them a 
short way as they walked to 
their parked ’copter, then turned 
its attention to a family of 
Terrans which included two 
small boys; the children threw 
nuts to the squirrel and it scam- 
pered in vigorous activity. 

“Convincing,” Milt said. And 
it really was. 

Mary said, “Too bad you 
couldn’t have seen Dr. DeWinter 
more, Milt. He could have 
helped you.” Her voice was odd- 
ly hard. 

“I have no doubt of that,” 
Milt Biskle agreed as they re- 
entered the parked ’copter. 

'VX7'hen they arrived back at 
Mary’s conapt he found his 
Martian wug-plant dead. It had 
evidently perished of dehydra- 
tion. 

“Don’t try to explain this,” he 
said to Mary as the two of them 
stood gazing down at the 
parched, dead stalks of the once 
active plant. “You know what it 
shows. Terra is supposedly more 
humid than Mars, even recon- 
structed Mars at its best. Yet this 
plant has completely dried out. 
There’s no moisture left on Ter- 
ra because I suppose the Prox 



blasts emptied the seas. Right?” 
Mary said nothing. 

“What I don’t understand,” 
Milt said, “is why it’s worth it to 
you people to keep the illusion 
going. I’ve finished my job.” 
After a pause Mary said, “May 
be there’re more planets requir- 
ing reconstruct work, Milt.” 
“Your population is that 
great?” 

“I was thinking of Terra. 
Here,” Mary said “Reconstruct 
work on it will take generations; 
all the talent and ability you re- 
construct engineers possess will 
be required.” She added, “I’m 
just following your hypothetical 
logic, of course.” 

“So Terra’s our next job. 
That’s why you let me come 
here. In fact I’m going to stay 
here.” He realized that, thor- 
oughly and utterly, in a flash of 
insight. “I won’t be going back 
to Mars and I won’t see Fay 
again. You’re replacing her.” It 
all made sense. 

“Well,” Mary said, with a 
faint wry smile, ‘let’s say I’m at- 
tempting to.” She stroked 
his arm. Barefoot, still in her 
sunsuit, she moved slowly closer 
and closer to him. 

Frightened, he backed away 
from her. Picking up the dead 
wug-plant he numbly carried it 
to the apt’s disposal chute and 
dropped the brittle, dry remains 
in. They vanished at once.

“And now,” Mary said busily, 
“we’re going to visit the Museum 
of Modern Art in New York 
and then, if we have time, the 
Smithsonian in Washington, 
D.C. They’ve asked me to keep 
you busy so you don't start 
brooding.” 

“But I am brooding,” Milt said 
as he watched her change from 
her sunsuit to a gray wool knit 
dress. Nothing can stop that, he 
said to himself. And you know 
it now. And as each reconstruct 
engineer finishes his area it’s go- 
ing to happen again. I’m just the 
first 

At least I’m not alone, he re- 
alized. And felt somewhat bet- 
ter. 

“How do I look?” Mary asked 
as she put on lipstick before the 
bedroom mirror. 

“Fine,” he said listlessly, and 
wondered if Mary would meet 
each reconstruct engineer in 
turn, become the mistress of 
each. Not only is she not what 
she seems, he thought, but I 
don’t even get to keep her. 

It seemed a gratuitous loss, 
easily avoided. 

He was, he realized, beginning 
to like her. Mary was alive; that 
much was real. Terran or not. 
At least they had not lost the 
war to shadows; they had lost to 
authentic living organisms. He 
felt somewhat cheered. 

“Ready for the Museum of 



Modern Art?” Mary said brisk- 
ly, with a smile. 

I ater, at the Smithsonian, 
after he had viewed the 
Spirit of St. Louis and the 
Wright brothers’ incredibly an- 
cient plane — it appeared to be 
at least a million years old — he 
caught sight of an exhibit which 
he had been anticipating. 

Saying nothing to Mary — she 
was absorbed in studying a case 
of semi-precious stones in their 
natural uncut state — he slipped 
off and, a moment later, stood 
before a glass-walled section en- 
titled 

PROX MILITARY OF 2014 

Three Prox soldiers stood fro- 
zen, their dark muzzles stained 
and grimy, side arms ready, in a 
makeshift shelter composed of 
the remains of one of their 
transports. A bloody Prox 
flag hung drably. This was a de- 
feated enclave of the enemy; 
these three creatures were about 
to surrender or be killed. 

A group of Terran visitors 
stood before the exhibit, 
gawking. Milt Biskle said to the 
man nearest him, “Convincing, 
isn’t it?” 

“Sure is,” the man, middle- 
aged, with glasses and gray hair, 
agreed. “Were you in the war?” 
he asked Milt, glancing at him. 



150 



GALAXY 



“I’m in reconstruct,” Milt 
said. “Yellow Engineer.” 

“Oh.” The man nodded, im- 
pressed. “Boy, those Proxmen 
look scary. You’d almost expect 
them to step out of that exhibit 
and fight us to the death.” He 
grinned. “They put up a good 
fight before they gave in, those 
Proxmen; you have to give ’em 
credit for that.” 

Beside him the man’s gray, 
taut wife said, “Those guns of 
theirs make me shiver. It’s too 
realistic.” Disapproving, she 
walked on. 

“You’re right,” Milt Biskle 
said. “They do look frightening- 
ly real, because of course they 
are.” There was no point in 
creating an illusion of this sort 
because the genuine thing lay 
immediately at hand, readily 
available. Milt swung himself 
under the guard rail, reached the 
transparent glass of the exhibit, 
raised his foot and smashed the 
glass; it burst and rained down 
with a furious racket of shiver- 
ing fragments. 

As Mary came running, Milt 
snatched a rifle from one of the 
frozen Proxmen in the exhibit 
and turned it toward her. 

She halted, breathing rapidly, 
eyeing him but saying nothing. 

“I am willing to work for 
you,” Milt said to her, holding 
the rifle expertly. “After all, if 
my own race no longer exists I 



can hardly reconstruct a colony 
world for them; even I can see 
that. But I want to know the 
truth. Show it to me and I’ll go 
on with my job.” 

Mary said, “No, Milt, if you 
knew the truth you wouldn’t go 
on. You’d turn that gun on your- 
self.” She sounded calm, even 
compassionate, but her eyes 
were bright and enlarged, wary. 

“Then I’ll kill you,” he said. 
And, after that, himself. 

“Wait.” She pondered. “Milt 
— this is so difficult. You know 
absolutely nothing and yet look 
how miserable you are. How do 
you expect to feel when you can 
see your planet as it is? It’s al- 
most too much for me and 
I’m — ” She hesitated. 

“Say it.” 

“I’m just a — ” she choked out 
the word — “a visitor.” 

“But I am right,” he said. “Say 
it. Admit it.” 

“You’re right, Milt,” she 
sighed. 

npwo uniformed museum 
-*■ guards appeared, holding 
pistols. “You okay, Miss Able- 
seth?” 

“For the present,” Mary said. 
She did not take her eyes off 
Milt and the rifle which he held. 
“Just wait,” she instructed the 
guards. 

“Yes ma’am.” The guards 
waited. No one moved. 



PRECIOUS ARTIFACT 



151 



Milt said, “Did any Terran 
women survive?’’ 

After a pause Mary said, 
“No, Milt. But we Proxmen are 
within the same genus, as you 
well know. We can interbreed. 
Doesn’t that make you feel bet- 
ter?” 

“Sure,” he said. “A lot bet- 
ter.” And he did feel like turn- 
ing the rifle on himself now, 
without waiting. It was all he 
could do to resist the impulse. 
So he had been right; that thing 
had not been Fay, there at Field 
Three on Mars. “Listen,” he said 
to Mary Ableseth, “I want to go 
back to Mars again. I came here 
to learn something, I learned it, 
now I want to go back. Maybe 
I’ll talk to Dr. DeWinter again, 
maybe he can help me. Any ob- 
jection to that?” 

“No.” She seemed to under- 
stand how he felt. “After all, you 
did all your work there. You 
have a right to return. But even- 
tually you have to begin here on 
Terra. We can wait a year or so, 
perhaps even two. But eventual- 
ly Mars will be filled up and 
we’ll need the room. And it’s go- 
ing to be so much harder here . 
as you’ll discover.” She tried to 
smile but failed; he saw the ef- 
fort. “I’m sorry, Milt.” 

“So am I,” Milt Biskle said. 
“Hell, I was sorry when that 
wug-plant died. I knew the truth 
then. It wasn’t just a guess.” 



“You’ll be interested to know 
that your fellow reconstruct en- 
gineer Red, Cleveland An- 
dre, addressed the meeting in 
your place. And passed your in- 
timations on to them all, along 
with his own. They voted to send 
an official delegate here to Ter- 
ra to investigate; he’s on his 
way now.” 

“I’m interested,” Milt said. 
“But it doesn’t really matter. It 
hardly changes things.” He put 
down the rifle. “Can I go back 
to Mars now?” He felt tired. 
“Tell Dr. DeWinter I’m com- 
ing.” Tell him, he thought to 
have every psychiatric tech- 
nique in this repertory ready for 
me, because it will take a lot. 
“What about Earth’s animals?” 
he asked. “Did any forms at all 
survive? How about the dog and 
the cat?” 

Mary glanced at the museum 
guards; a flicker of communica- 
tion passed silently between 
them and then Mary said, “May- 
be it’s all right after all.” 

What’s all right?” Milt 
Biskle said. 

“For you to see. Just for a mo- 
ment You seem to be standing 
up to it better than we had ex- 
pected. In our opinion you are 
entitled to that.” She added, 
“Yes, Milt, the dog and cat sur- 
vived; they live here among the 
ruins. Come along and look.” 



152 



GALAXY 



He followed after her, think- 
ing to himself, Wasn’t she right 
the first time? Do I really want 
to look? Can I stand up to what 
exists in actuality — what 
they’ve felt the need of keeping 
from me up until now? 

At the exit ramp of the mu- 
seum Mary halted and said, “Go 
on outside, Milt. I’ll stay here. 
I’ll be waiting for you when you 
come back in.” 

Haltingly, he descended the 
ramp. 

And saw. 

It was, of course, as she had 
said, ruins. The city had been de- 
capitated, leveled three feet 
above ground-level; the build- 
ings had become hollow square, 
without contents, like some in- 
finite arrangement of use- 
less, ancient courtyards. He 
could not believe that what he 
saw was new; it seemed to him 
as if these abandoned remnants 
had always been there, exactly 
as they were now. And — how 
long would they remain this 
way? 

To the right an elaborate but 
small - scale mechanical system 
had plopped itself down to a de- 
bris-filled street. As he watched, 
it extended a host of pseudopo- 
dia which burrowed inquisitive- 
ly into the nearby foundations. 
The foundations, steel and ce- 
ment, were abruptly pulverized; 
the bare ground, exposed, lay 



naked and dark brown, seared 
over from the atomic heat gen- 
erated by the repair autonomic 
rig — a construct, Milt Biskle 
thought, not much differ- 
ent from those I employ on Mars. 
At least to some meager extent 
the rig had the task of clearing 
away the old. He knew from his 
own reconstruct work on Mars 
that it would be followed, prob- 
ably within minutes, by an 
equally elaborate mechanism 
which would lay the groundwork 
for the new structures to come. 

And, standing off to one side 
in the otherwise deserted street, 
watching this limited clearing- 
work in progress, two gray, thin 
figures could be made out. Two 
hawk-nosed Proxmen with their 
pale, natural hair arranged in 
high coils, their earlobes elon- 
gated with heavy weights. 

The victors, he thought to 
himself. Experiencing the satis- 
faction of this spectacle, witness- 
ing the last artifacts of the de- 
feated race being obliterated. 
Some day a purely Prox city will 
rise up here: Prox architecture, 
streets of the odd, wide Prox pat- 
tern, the uniform boy-like build- 
ings with their many subsurface 
levels. And citizens such as these 
will be treading the ramps, ac- 
cepting the high-speed runnels 
in their daily routines. And 
what, he thought, about the Ter- 
ran dogs and cats which now in- 



PRECIOUS ARTIFACT 



153 



habit these ruins, as Mary said? 
Will even they disappear? Prob- 
ably not entirely. There will be 
room for them, perhaps in mu- 
seums and zoos, as oddities to 
be gaped at. Survivals of an ecol- 
ogy which no longer obtained. 
Or even mattered. 

And yet — Mary was right. 
The Proxman were within the 
same genus. Even if they did not 
interbreed with the remaining 
Terrans the species as he had 
known it would go on. And they 
would interbreed, he thought. 
His own relationship with Mary 
was a harbinger. As individuals 
they were not so far apart. The 
results might even be good. 

The results, he thought as he 
turned away and started back in- 
to the museum, may be a race 
not quite Prox and not quite 
Terran; something that is gen- 
uinely new may come from the 
melding. At least we can hope 
so. 

Terra would be rebuilt. He 
had seen slight but real work in 
progress with his own eyes. Per- 
haps the Proxmen lacked the 
skill that he and his fellow re- 
construct engineers possessed . 
but now that Mars was virtually 
done they could begin here. It 
was not absolutely hopeless. Not 
quite. 

Walking up to Mary he said 
hoarsely, “Do me a favor. Get 
me a cat I can take back to 



Mars with me. I’ve always liked 
cats. Especially the orange ones 
with stripes.” 

One of the museum guards, 
after a glance at his companion, 
said, “We can arrange that, Mr. 
Biskle. We can get a — cub, is 
that the word?” 

“Kitten, I think,” Mary cor- 
rected. 

/'An the trip back to Mars, 
^ ^ Milt Biskle sat with the 
box containing the orange kitten 
on his lap, working out his plans. 
In fifteen minutes the ship 
would land on Mars and Dr. De- 
Winter — or the thing that 
posed as Dr. DeWinter anyhow 
— would be waiting to meet him. 
And it would be too late. From 
where he sat he could see the 
emergency escape hatch with its 
red warning light. His plans had 
become focused around the 
hatch. It was not ideal but it 
would serve. 

In the box the orange kitten 
reached up a paw and batted at 
Milt’s hand. He felt the sharp, 
tiny claws rake across his hand 
and he absently disengaged his 
flesh, retreating from the prob- 
ing reach of the animal. You 
wouldn’t have liked Mars any- 
how, he thought, and rose to his 
feet. 

Carrying the box he strode 
swiftly toward the emergency 
hatch. Before the stewardess 



154 



GALAXY 



could reach him he had thrown 
open the hatch. He stepped for- 
ward and the hatch locked be- 
hind him. For an instant he was 
within the cramped unit, and 
then he began to twist open the 
heavy outer door. 

“Mr. Biskle!” the stewardess’ 
voice came, muffled by the door 
behind him. He heard her fum- 
bling to reach him, opening the 
door and groping to catch hold 
of him. 

As he twisted open the outer 
door the kitten within the box 
under his arm snarled. 

You, too? Milt Biskle thought, 
and paused. 

Death, the emptiness and utter 
lack of warmth of ’tween space, 
seeped around him, filtering 
past the partly opened out- 
er door. He smelled it and some- 
thing within him, as in the kit- 
ten, retreated by instinct. He 
paused, holding the box, not try- 
ing to push the outer door any 
farther open, and in that mo- 
ment the stewardess grabbed 
him. 

“Mr. Biskle,” she said with a 
half-sob, “are you out of your 
mind? Good God what are you 
doing?” She managed to tug the 
outer door shut, screw the emer- 
gency section back into shut po- 
sition. 

“You know exactly what I’m 
doing,” Milt Biskle said as he al- 
lowed her to propel him back 



into the ship and to his seat. 
And don’t think you stopped me, 
he said to himself. Because it 
wasn’t you. I could have gone 
ahead and done it. But I decid- 
ed not to. 

He wondered why. 

L ater, at Field Three on 
Mars, Dr. DeWinter met 
him as he had expected. 

The two of them walked to the 
parked ’copter and DeWinter in 
a worried tone of voice said, 
“I’ve just been informed that 
during the trip — ” 

“That’s right. I attempted sui- 
cide. But I changed my mind. 
Maybe you know why. You’re 
the psychologist, the authority 
as to what goes on inside us.” He 
entered the ’copter, being care- 
ful not to bang the box contain- 
ing the Terran kitten. 

“You’re going to go ahead and 
stake your land parcel with 
Fay?” Dr. DeWinter asked pres- 
ently as the ’copter flew above 
green, wet fields of high protein 
wheat. “Even though — you 
know?” 

“Yes.” He nodded. After all, 
there was nothing else for him, 
as far as he could make out. 

“You Terrans.” DeWinter 
shook his head. “Admirable.” 
Now he noticed the box on Milt 
Biskle’s lap. “What’s that you 
have there? A creature from 
Terra?” He eyed it suspiciously; 



PRECIOUS ARTIFACT 



155 



obviously to him it was the man- 
ifestation of an alien form of 
life. “A rather peculiar-looking 
organism.” 

“It’s going to keep me com- 
pany,” Milt Biskle said. “While 
I go on with my work, either 
building up my private parcel 
or — ” Or helping you Proxmen 
with Terra, he thought. 

“Is that what was called a ‘rat- 
tlesnake’? I detect the sound of 
its rattles.” Dr. DeWinter edged 
away. 

“It’s purring.” Milt Biskle 
stroked the kitten as the auto- 
nomic circuit of the ’copter 
guided it across the dully red 
Martian sky. Contact with the 
one familiar life-form, he re- 
alized, will keep me sane. It will 
make it possible for me to go 
on. He felt grateful. My race may 
have been defeated and de- 
stroyed, but not all Terran crea- 
tures have perished. When we re- 
construct Terra maybe we can 
induce the authorities to allow 
us to set up game preserves. 
We’ll make that part of our 
task, he told himself, and again 
he patted the kitten. At least we 
can hope for that much. 

Next to him, Dr. DeWinter 
was also deep in thought. He ap- 
preciated the intricate work- 
manship, by engineers stationed 
on the third planet, which had 
gone into the simulacrum resting 
in the box on Milt Biskle’s lap. 



The technical achievement was 
impressive, even to him, and he 
saw clearly — as Milt Biskle of 
course did not. This artifact, ac- 
cepted by the Terran as an au- 
thentic organism from his fa- 
miliar past, would provide a 
pivot by which the man would 
hang onto his psychic balance. 

But what about the other re- 
construct engineers? What 
would carry each of them 
through and past the moment of 
discovery as each completed his 
work and had to — whether he 
liked it or not — awake? 

I t would vary from Terran 
to Terran. A dog for one, a 
more elaborate simulacrum, pos- 
sibly that of a nubile human fe- 
male, for another. In any case 
each would be provided with an 
“exception” to the true state. 
One essential surviving entity, 
selected out of what had in fact 
totally vanished. Research into 
the past of each engineer would 
provide the clue, as it had in 
Biskle’s instance; the cat-simula- 
crum had been finished weeks 
before his abrupt, panic-strick- 
en trip home to Terra. For in- 
stance, in Andre’s case a parrot- 
simulacrum was already under 
construction. It would be done 
by the time he made his trip 
home. 

“I call him Thunder,” Milt 
Biskle explained. 



156 



GALAXY 



"Good name,” Dr. DeWinter 

— as he titled himself these days 

— said. And thought, A shame 
we could not have shown him 
the real situation on Terra. Ac- 
tually it’s quite interesting that 
he accepted what he saw, be- 
cause on some level he must re- 
alize that nothing survives a war 
of the kind we conducted. Ob- 
viously he desperately wanted to 
believe that a remnant, even 
though no more than rubble, en- 
dures. But it’s typical of the Ter- 



ran mind to fasten onto phan- 
toms. That might help explain 
their defeat in the conflict; they 
were simply not realists. 

“This cat,” Milt Biskle said, 
“is going to be a mighty hunter 
of Martian sneak-mice.” 

“Right,” Dr. DeWinter agreed, 
and thought, As long as its bat- 
teries don’t run down. He, too, 
patted the kitten. 

A switch closed and the kitten 
purred louder.

Harry Harrison, who wrote Deathworld, How the Old World Died (in this

complete short novel in our next Galaxy. It is about an immense interstellar 
war. Cultures clash. Huge fleets raven at each other. Casualties mount at 
the speed of light. It is, in short, a space-war yarn m the classic tradition 
. except that Harrison, who is a very funny man, began chuckling to 
himself as he put the first page on paper. And the result is something to see. 
Now, we don't promise that The Starloggers will inspire you or make you

know I was alive, because you 
were too busy losing the state

for our client. I pulled you out 
of that one, just like I’m going 
to pull you out now.” 

The smile was a little crack- 
ed, but Haber had been with the 
company a long time and he 
wasn’t going to let me throw him. 
“What do you want me to say, 
Gunner? I’m grateful. Believe 
me, boy, I know I need help — ” 

“And I’m not your boy. Haber, 
you were a fat cat then, and 
you’re a fat cat now. All I want 
from you is, first, a quick look 
around the shop here and, sec- 
ond, a conference of all depart- 
ment heads, including you, in 
thirty minutes. So tell your sec- 
retary to round them up, and 
let’s get started on the sightsee- 
ing. 

/"doming in to Belport on the 
^ scatjet I had made a list 
of things to do. The top item 
was: 

1. Fire Haber. 

Still, in my experience that 
isn’t always the best way to put 
out a fire. Some warts you re- 
move, some you just let wither 
away in obscurity. I am not paid 
by M&B to perform cosmetic 
surgery on their Habers, only to 
see that the work the Habers 
should have done gets accom- 
plished. 

As a public relations branch 



manager he was a wart, but as t 
tourist guide he was fine, al- 
though he was perspiring. He 
led me all around the shop. He 
had taken a storefront on one 
of the main shopping malls, air- 
curtain door, windows draped 
tastefully in gray silk. It looked 
like the best of four funeral par- 
lors in a run-down neighborhood 
In gilt letters on the window was 
the name of the game: 

MOULTRIE AND BIGELOW 
Public Relations 
Northern Lake State Division 
T. Wilson Haber, Division 
Manager 

“Public relations,” he informed 
me, “starts at home. They know 
we’re here, eh, Gunner?” 

“Reminds me of the Iowa of- 
fice,” I said, and he stumbled 
where there wasn’t even a sill. 
That was the presidential cam- 
paign of ’88, where Haber had 
been trying to carry the state 
for the candidate who had re- 
tained us, and those twelve elec- 
toral votes came over at the 
last minute only because we sent 
Haber to Nassau to rest and I 
took over from him. I believe 
Haber’s wife had owned stock 
in the company. 

His Belport layout was pretty 
good at that, though. Four pry 
booths, each with a Simplex 9090 
and an operator-receptionist in

the donor’s waiting room. You 
can’t tell from appearances, but 
the donors who were waiting for 
their interrogation looked like a 
good representative sample — a 
good mixture of sexes, ages, con- 
ditions of affluence — and with 
proper attention to weighing he 
should at least be getting a fair 
survey of opinions. Integration of 
the pry-scores was in a readout 
station in back — I recognized 
one of the programmers and nod- 
ded to him: good man — along 
with telefax equipment to the 
major research sources, the Bri- 
tannica, Library of Congress, 
news-wire services and so on. 
From the integration room the 
readout operator could con- 
struct a speech, a 3-V commer- 
cial, a space ad or anything else, 
with the research lines to feed 
him any data ' he needed, and 
test its appeal on his subjects. 
In the front of the building was 
a taping booth and studio. 
Everything was small and semi- 
portable, but good stuff. You 
could put together a 3-V inter- 
view or edit one as well here as 
you could on the lot in the Home 
Office. 

“An A-Number One setup, 
right, Gunner?” said Haber. “Set 
it up myself to do the job.” 

I said. “Then why aren’t you 
doing it?” He tightened up. The 
eyi . looked smaller and more 
intelligent, but he didn’t say any- 



thing directly. He took my elbow 
and turned me to the data-pro- 
cessing room. 

“Want you to meet someone,” 
he said, opened the door, led me 
inside and left me. 

A tall, slim girl looked up from 
a typer. “Why, hello, Gunner,” 
she said. “It’s been a long time.” 

I said, “Hello, Candace.” 

Apparently Haber was not 
quite such a fat cat as he had 
seemed, for he had clearly found 
out a little something about my 
personal life before I showed up 
in his office. The rest of the list 
I had scribbled down in the scat- 
jet was: 

2. Need “big lie”. 

3. Investigate Children. 

4. Investigate opponents prop- 
osition. 

5. Marry Candace Harmon? 

nphis was a relatively small job 
for Moultrie & Bigelow, but 
it was for a very, very big ac- 
count. It was important to win 
it. The client was the Arcturan 
Confederacy. 

In the shop the word was that 
they had been turned down by 
three or four other PR agencies 
before we took them on. No- 
body said why, exactly, but the 
reason was perfectly clear. It was 
just because they were the Arc- 
turan Confederacy. There is 
nothing in any way illegal or

immoral about a public-relations 
firm representing a foreign ac- 
count. That is a matter of statute 
— as most people don’t take the 
trouble to know: the Smith- 

Macchioni Act of ’71. And the 
courts held that it applied to 
extra-planetary “foreigners” as 
well as to Terrestrials in 1985, 
back when the only “intelligent 
aliens” were the mummies on 
Mars. Not that the mummies 
had ever hired anybody on Earth 
to do anything for them. But it 
was Moultrie & Bigelow’s law 
department that sued for the 
declaratory judgement, as a mat- 
ter of fact. Just on the off 
chance. That’s how M&B oper- 
ates. 

Any public-relations man takes 
on the color of his clients in the 
eyes of some people. That’s the 
nature of the beast. The same 
people wouldn’t think of blaming 
a surgeon because he dissolved 
a malignancy out of Public 
Enemy No. 1, or even a lawyer 
for defending him. But when you 
are in charge of a client’s emo- 
tional image, and that image 
isn’t liked, some of the dislike 
rubs off on you. 

At M&B there is enough in the 
paycheck at the end of every 
month so that we don’t mind 
that. M&B has a reputation for 
taking on the tough ones — the 
only surviving American cigarette 
manufacturer is ours. So is the 

162 



exiled Castroite government of 
Cuba, that still thinks it might 
one day get the State Depart- 
ment to back up its claim for 
paying off on the bonds it printed 
for itself. However, for two rea- 
sons — as a simple matter of 
making things easy for ourselves; 
and because it’s better doctrine 
— we don’t flaunt our connection 
with the unpopular clients. Es- 
pecially when the job is going 
badly. One of the surest ways 
to get a bad public response to 
PR is to let the public know that 
some hotshot PR outfit is work- 
ing on it. 

So every last thing Haber had 
done was wrong. 

In this town, it was too late 
for pry booths and M/R. 

I had just five minutes left 
before the conference, and I 
spent it in the pry-booth section 
anyhow. I noticed a tri-D display 
of our client’s home planet in 
the reception room, where donors 
were sitting and waiting their 
turn. It was very attractive: the 
wide, calm seas with the vertical 
air-mount islets jutting out at 
intervals. 

T turned around and walked out 
fast, boiling mad. 

A layman might not have seen 
just how many ways Haber had 
found to go wrong. The whole 
pry-booth project was probably 
a mistake anyway. To begin with, 

GALAXY

to got any good out of pry booths 
you need depth interviews, way 
deep-down M/R stuff. And for 
that you need paid donors, lots 
of them. And to get them you 
have to have a panel to pick 
from. 

That means advertising in the 
papers and on the nets and in- 
terviewing twenty people for 
every one you hire. To get a 
satisfactory sample in a town 
the size of Belport you need to 
hire maybe fifty donors. And 
that means talking to a thousand 
people, every one of whom will 
go home and talk to his wife or 
her mother or their neighbors. 

In a city like Chicago or Saska- 
toon you can get away with it. 
With good technique the donor 
never really knows what he’s be- 
ing interviewed for, although of 
course a good newspaperman or 
private eye can interview a cou- 
ple of donors and work back- 
ward from the sense-impulse 
stimuli with pretty fair accuracy. 
But not in Belport, not when we 
never had a branch here before, 
not when every living soul in 
town knew what we were doing 
because the rezoning ordinance 
was Topic One over every coffee 
table. In short, we had tipped 
our hand completely. 

A-: I say, an amateur might 
not have spotted that. But Haber 
WM i not supposed to be an ama- 
teur. 



I had just seen the trend- 
charts, too. The referendum on 
granting rezoning privileges to 
our client was going to a vote in 
less than two weeks. When Haber 
had opened the branch, sampling 
showed that it would fail by a 
four to three vote. Now, a month 
and a half later, he had worsen- 
ed the percentage to three to 
two and going downhill all the 
way. 

Our client would be extremely 
unhappy — probably was un- 
happy already, if they had man- 
aged to puzzle out the queer 
terrestrial progress reports we 
had been sending them. 

And this was the kind of cli- 
ent that a flackery didn’t want 
to have unhappy. I mean, all 
the others were little-league stuff 
in comparison. The Arcturan 
Confederacy was a culture as 
wealthy and as powerful as all 
Earth governments combined, 
and as Arcturans don’t bother 
with nonsense like national gov- 
ernments or private enterprise, 
at least not in any way that 
makes sense to us, this one client 
was — 

As big as every other possible 
client combined. 

They were the ones who de- 
cided they needed this base in 
Belport, and it was up to M&B 
— and specifically to me, Odin 
Gunnarsen — ■ to see that they 
got it 



III! ( HILDREN OF NIGHT

It was too bad that they had 
been fighting Earth six months 
earlier. 

In fact, in a technical sense 
we were still at war. It was 
only armistice, not a peace, that 
had called off the H-bomb raids 
and the fleet engagements. 

Like I say. M&B takes on the 
tough ones! 

Tjesides Haber, four of the staff 
looked as though they knew 
wh'ch end was up. Candace Har- 
mon, the pry-integration pro- 
grammer and two very junior 
T.A.s. I took the head chair at 
the conference table without 
waiting to see where Haber 
would want to sit and said, “We’ll 
make this fast, because we’re in 
trouble here and we don’t have 
time to be polite. You’re Percy?” 
That was the programmer; he 
nodded. “And I didn’t catch your 
name?” I said, turning to the 
next along the table. It was the 
copy chief, a lanky shave-head- 
ed oldster named Tracy Spock- 
man. His assistant, one of the 
T.A.s I had had my eye on, 
turned out to be named Manny 
Brock. 

I had picked easy jobs for all 
the deadheads, reserving the 
smart ones for whatever might 
turn up, so I started with the 
copy chief. “Spockman, we’re 
opening an Arcturan purchasing 
agency and you’re it You should 



be able to handle this one; if I 
remember correctly, you ran the 
Duluth shop for a year.” 

He sucked on a cal pipe with- 
out expression. “Well, thanks, 
Mr. Gun — ” 

“Just Gunner.” 

“Well, thanks, but as copy 
chief — ” 

“Manny here should be able 
to take care of that, If I remem- 
ber the way you ran the Duluth 
operation, you’ve probably got 
things set up so he can step 
right in.” And so he probably 
did. At least, it surely would do 
no real harm to give somebody 
else a chance at lousing things 
up. I handed Spockman the “po- 
sitions wanted” page from the 
paper I’d picked up at the scat- 
port and a scrawled list of notes 
I’d made up on the way in. “Hire 
these girls I’ve marked for your 
staff, rent an office and get some 
letters out. You’ll see what I 
want from the list. Letters to 
every real estate dealer in town, 
asking them if they can put to- 
gether a five thousand acre parcel 
in the area covered by the zon- 
ing referendum. Letter to every 
general contractor, asking for 
bids on buildings. Make it separ- 
ate bids on each — I think 
there’ll be five buildings alto- 
gether. One exoclimatized — so 
get the air-conditioning, heating 
and plumbing contractors to bid, 
too. Letter to every food whole- 



164 



GALAXY 



Baler and major grocery outlet 
asking if they are interested in 
bidding on supplying Arcturans 
with food. Fax Chicago for what 
the Arcturans fancy, I don’t re- 
member — no meat, I think, but 
a lot of green vegetables — any- 
way, find out and include the 
data in the letters. Electronics 
manufacturers, office equipment 
dealers, car and truck agencies 
— well, the whole list is on that 
piece of paper. I want every busi- 
nessman in Belport starting to 
figure out by tomorrow morning 
how much profit he might make 
on an Acturan base. Got it?” 

“I think so, Mr. — Gunner. I 
was thinking. How about station- 
ery suppliers, attornies, C.P.- 
A’s?” 

“Don’t ask, do it. Now, you 
down at the end there — ” 

“Henry Dane, Gunner.” 

“Henry, what about club out- 
lets in Belport? I mean special- 
ized groups. The Arcturans are 
hot for navigation, sailing, like 
that; see what you can do with 
the motorboat clubs and so on. 
I noticed in the paper that 
there’s a flower show at the Arm- 
ory next Saturday. It’s pretty 
late, but squeeze in a speaker 
on Arcturan fungi. We’ll fly in 
a display. They tell me Arctur- 
ans are hot gardeners when 
they’re home — love all the bio- 
logical sciences — nice folks, like 
to dabble.” I hesitated and 



looked at my notes. “I have 
something down here about vet- 
erans’ groups, but I haven’t got 
the handle for it. Still, if you can 
think of an angle, let me know — 
what’s the matter?” 

He was looking doubtful. “It’s 
only that I don’t want to con- 
flict with Candy, Gunner.” 

And so, of course, I had to 
face up to things and turn to 
Candace Harmon. “What’s that, 
honey?” I asked. 

“I think Henry means my 
Arcturan-American Friendship 
League.” It turned out that that 
had been one of Haber’s proudest 
ideas. I wasn’t surprised. After 
several weeks and about three 
thousand dollars it had worked 
up to a total of forty-one mem- 
bers. How many of those were 
employees of the M&B branch? 
“Well, all but eight,” Candace 
admitted at once. She wasn’t 
smiling, but she was amused. 

“Don’t worry about it,” I ad- 
vised Henry Dane. “We’re fold- 
ing the Arcturan - American 
Friendship League anyway. 
Candace won’t have time for it. 
She’ll be working with me.” 
“Why, fine, Gunner,” she said. 
“Doing what?” 

T almost did marry Candace 
one time, and every once in 
a while since I have wished I 
hadn’t backed away. A very good 
thing was Candace Harmon. 



THE CHILDREN OF NIGHT 



165 



“Doing,” I said, “what Gun- 
ner says for you to do. Let’s see. 
First thing, I’ve got five hundred 
Arcturan domestic animals com- 
ing in tomorrow. I haven’t seen 
them, but they tell me they’re 
cute, look like kittens, are pretty 
durable. Figure out some way of 
getting them distributed fast — ■ 
maybe a pet shop will sell them 
for fifty cents each.” 

Haber protested, “My dear 
Gunner! The freight alone — ” 
“Sure, Haber, they cost about 
forty dollars apiece just to get 
them here. Any other questions 
like that? No? That’s good. I 
want one in each of five hundred 
homes by the end of the week, 
and if I had to pay a hundred 
dollars to each customer to take 
them, I’d pay. Next: I want 
somebody to find me a veteran, 
preferably disabled, preferably 
who was actually involved in the 
bombing of the home planet — ” 
I laid out a dozen more work- 
ing lines, an art show of the Arc- 
turan bas-relief stuff that was 
partly to look at but mostly to 
feel, a 3-V panel show on Arc- 
turus that we could plant . 
the whole routine. None of it 
would do the job, but all of it 
would help until I got my bear- 
ings. Then I got down to busi- 
ness. “What’s the name of this 
fellow that’s running for coun- 
cilman, Connick?” 

“That’s right,” said Haber. 



“What’ve you got on him?” I 
asked. 

I turned to Candace, who said 
promptly, “Forty-one years old, 
Methodist, married, three kids 
of his own plus one of the cas- 
ualties, ran for State Senate last 
year and lost, but he carried Bel- 
port, running opposed to the ref- 
erendum this year, very big in 
Junior Chamber of Commerce 
and V.F.W.— ” 

“No. What’ve you got on him?” 
I persisted. 

Candace said slowly, “Gunner, 
look. This is a nice guy.” 

“Why, I know that, honey. I 
read his piece in the paper to- 
day. So now tell me the dirt that 
he can’t afford to have come 
out.” 

“It wouldn’t be fair to destroy 
him for nothing!” 

I brushed aside the “fair” busi- 
ness. “What do you mean, ‘for 
nothing’?” 

“We’re not going to win this 
referendum, you know.” 

“Honey, I’ve got news for you. 
This is the biggest account any- 
body ever had and I want it. We 
will win. What’ve you got on 
Connick?” 

“Nothing. Really nothing,” she 
said quietly. 

“But you can get it.” 

Candace said, visibly upset, 
“Of course, there’s probably 
some — ” 

“Of course. Get it. Today.”

T>ut I wasn’t relying totally on 
anyone, not even Candace. 
Since Connick was the central 
figure of the opposition I caught 
a cab and went to see him. 

It was already dark, a cold, 
clear night, and over the mush- 
room towers of the business dis- 
trict a quarter-moon was begin- 
ning to rise. I looked at it almost 
with affection, I had hated it so 
when I was there. 

As I paid the cab two kids in 
■nowsuits came sidling out to in- 
spect me. I said, “Hello. Is your 
Daddy home?” 

One was about five, with 
freckles and bright blue eyes; the 
other was darker, brown-eyed, 
and he had a limp. The blue- 
eyed one said, “Daddy’s down 
in the cellar. Mommy will let 
you in if you ring the doorbell. 
Just push that button.” 

“Oh, that’s how those things 
work. Thanks.” Connick’s wife 
turned out to be a good-looking, 
skinny blonde in her thirties; and 
the kids must have raced around 
the back way and alerted the old 
man, because as she was taking 
my coat he was already coming 
through the hall. 

I shook his hand and said, “I 
can tell by the smells from your 
kitchen that it’s dinner time. I 
won’t keep you. My name ia 
Gunnarsen and — ” 



“And you’re from Moultrie and 
Bigelow — here, sit down, Mr. 
Gunnarsen — and you want to 
know if I won’t think it over and 
back the Arcturan base. No, Mr. 
Gunnarsen, I won’t. But why 
don’t you have a drink with me 
before dinner? And then why 
don’t you have dinner?” 

He was a genuine article, this 
Connick. I had to admit he had 
caught me off balance. 

“Why, I don’t mind if I do,” I 
said after a moment. “I see you 
know why I’m here.” 

He was pouring drinks. “Well, 
not altogether, Mr. Gunnarsen. 
You don’t really think you’ll 
change my mind, do you?” 

“I can’t say that until I know 
why you oppose the base in the 
first place, Connick. That’s what 
I want to find out.” 

He handed me a drink, sat 
down across from me and took a 
thoughtful pull at his own. It 
was good Scotch. Then he looked 
to see if the kids were within ear- 
shot, and said : “The thing is 
this, Mr. Gunnarsen. If I could, 
I would kill every Arcturan alive, 
and if it meant I had to accept 
the death of a few million Earth- 
men to do it, that wouldn’t be 
too high a price. I don’t want the 
base here because I don’t want 
anything to do witfi those mur- 
dering animals.” 

“Well, you’re candid,” I said; 
finished my drink, and added, 



THE CHILDREN OF NIGHT 



167 



“If you meant that invitation to 
dinner, I believe I will take you 
up on it.” 

T must say they were a nice 
family. I’ve worked elections 
before: Connick was a good can- 
didate because he was a good 
man. The way his kids behaved 
around him proved it; and the 
way he behaved around me was 
the clincher. I didn’t scare him a 
bit. 

Of course, that was not alto- 
gether bad, from my point of 
view. 

Connick kept the conversation 
off Topic A during dinner, which 
was all right with me, but as soon 
as it was over and we were alone 
he said, “All right. You can make 
your pitch now, Mr. Gunnarsen. 
Although I don’t know why 
you’re here instead of with Tom 
Schlitz.” 

Schlitz was the man he was 
running against. I said, “You 
don’t know this business, I guess. 
What do we need him for? He’s 
already committed on our side.” 
“And I’m already committed 
against you, but I guess that’s 
what you’re hoping to change. 
Well, what’s your offer?” 

He was moving too fast for 
me. I pretended to misunder- 
stand. “Really, Mr. Connick, I 
wouldn’t insult you by offering 
a bribe — ” 

“No, I know you wouldn’t. Be- 



cause you’re smart enough to 
know I wouldn’t take money. So 
it isn’t money. What is it, then? 
Moultrie & Bigelow working for 
me instead of Schlitz in the elec- 
tion? That’s a pretty good offer, 
but the price is too high. I won’t 
pay it.” 

“Well,” I said, “as a matter of 
fact, we would be willing — ” 
“Yes, I thought so. No deal. 
Anyway, do you really think I 
need help to get elected?” 

That was a good point, I was 
forced to admit. I conceded, 
“No, not if everything else was 
equal. You’re way ahead right 
now, as your surveys and ours 
both show. But everything else 
isn’t equal.” 

“By which you mean that 
you’re going to help old Slits- 
and-fits. All right, that makes it 
a horse race.” 

I held up my glass and he re- 
filled it. I said, “Mr. Connick, 
I told you once you didn’t know 
this business. You don’t. It isn’t 
a horse race because you can’t 
win against us.” 

“I can sure give it the hell of 
a try, though. Anyway — ” he fin- 
ished his own drink thoughtfully 
— “you brainwashers are a little 
bit fat, I think. Everybody knows 
how powerful you are, and you 
haven’t really had to show it 
much lately. I wonder if the em- 
peror’s really running around 
naked.”

“Oh, no, Mr. Connick. Best 
dressed emperor you ever saw, 
take my word for it.” 

He said, frowning a little bit, 
“I think I’ll have to find out for 
myself. Anyway, frankly, I think 
people’s minds are made up and 
you can’t change them.” 

“We don’t have to,” I said. 
“Don’t you know why people 
vote the way they do, Connick? 
They don’t vote their ‘minds’. 
They vote attitudes and they 
vote impulses. Frankly, I’d rather 
work on your side than against 
you. Schlitz would be easy to 
beat. He’s Jewish.” 

Connick said angrily, “There’s 
none of that in Belport, man.” 
“Of anti-semitism, you mean. 
Of course not. But if one candi- 
date is Jewish, and if it turns up 
that fifteen years ago he tried to 
square a parking ticket — and 
there’s always something that 
turns up, Connick, believe me — 
then they’ll vote against him for 
fixing parking tickets. That’s 
what I mean by ‘attitudes’. Your 
voter — oh, not all of them; but 
enough to swing any election — 
goes into the booth pulled this 
way and that. We don’t have to 
change his mind. We just have 
to help him decide which part of 
it to operate on.” I let him refill 
my glass, and took a pull at it. 
I was aware that I was begin- 
ning to feel the effects. “Take 
you, Connick,” I said. “Suppose 



you’re a Democrat and you go 
in to cast your vote. We know 
how you’re going to vote for 
president, right? You’re going to 
vote for the Democratic candi- 
date.” 

Connick said, not unbending 
much, “Not necessarily. But 
probably.” 

CtXTot necessarily, right. And 

^ ' why not necessarily? Be- 
cause maybe you know this fel- 
low who’s running on the Dem- 
ocratic ticket — or maybe some- 
body you know has a grudge 
against him, couldn’t get the post- 
master’s job he wanted, or ran 
against his delegates for the con- 
vention. Point is, you have some- 
thing against him just because 
your first instinct is for him. So 
how do you vote? Whichever 
way happens to get dominance 
at the moment of voting. Not at 
any other moment. Not as a mat- 
ter of principle. But right then. 
No, we don’t have to change any 
minds . because most people 
don’t have enough mind to 
change!” 

He stood up and absent-mind- 
edly filled his own glass — I 
wasn’t the only one who was be- 
ginning to feel the liquor. “I’d 
hate to be you,” he said, half to 
himself. 

“Oh, it’s not bad.” 

He shook his head, then 
recollected himself and said, 



THE CHILDREN OF NIGHT

“Well, thanks for the lesson. I 
didn’t know. But I’ll tell you one 
thing you’ll never do. You’ll nev- 
er get me to vote on the Arctur- 
an side on any question.’’ 

I sneered, “There’s an open 
mind for you! Leader of the 
people! Takes an objective look 
at every question!” 

“All right, I’m not objective. 
They stink.” 

“Race prejudice, Connick?” 
“Oh, don’t be a fool.” 

“There is,” I said, “an Arc- 
turan aroma. They can’t help 
it.” 

“I didn’t say ‘smell’. I said 
‘stink’. I don’t want them in this 
town and neither does anybody 
else. Not even Schlitz.” 

“You don’t have to ever see 
them, They don’t like Earth cli- 
mate, you know. Too hot for 
them. Too much air. Why, Con- 
nick,” I said, “I’ll bet you a hun- 
dred bucks you won’t set eyes on 
an Arcturan for at least a year, 
not until the base is built and 
staffed. .And then I doubt they’ll 
bother to — What’s the matter?” 
He. was looking at me as 
though I were an idiot, and I 
almost began to think I was. 

“Why,” he said, again in that 
tone that was more to himself 
than to me, “I guess I’ve been 
overrating you. You think you’re 
God, so I’ve been accepting your 
own valuation.” 

“What do you mean?" 



“Inexcusably bad staff work, 
Mr. Gunnarsen,” he said, nod- 
ding judgematically. “It ought to 
make me feel good. But you 
know, it doesn’t. It scares me. 
With the kind of power you 
throw around, you should al- 
ways be right.” 

“Spit it out!” 

“It’s just that you lose your 
bet. Didn’t you know there’s an 
Arcturan in town right now?” 

Ill 

"fit Then I got back to the car 
* ' the phone was buzzing and 
the “Message Recorded” light 
blinked at me. The message was 
from Candace: 

“Gunner, a Truce Team has 
checked into the Statler-Bills to 
supervise the election and get 
this. One of them’s an Arctur- 
an!” 

The staff work wasn’t so bad, 
after all, just unpardonably 
slow. But there wasn’t much 
comfort in that. ■ 

I called the hotel and was 
connected with one of the Truce 
Team staff — the best the hotel 
would do for me. The staff man 
was a colonel who said, “Yes, 
Mr. Knafti is aware of your work 
here and specifically does not 
wish to see you. This is a Truce 
Team, Mr. Gunnarsen. Do you 
know what that means, exactly?” 
And he hung up on me. Well, 



170

I did know what it meant — 
strictly hands-off, all the way — 
I simply hadn’t known that they 
would interpret it that rigidly. 

It was a kick in the eye, any 
way I looked at it. Because it 
made me look like a fool in front 
of Connick, when I kind of want- 
ed him scared of me. Because 
Arcturans do, after all, stink — 
not good public relations at all, 
when your product smells like 
well-rotted garlic buds a few 
hundred feet away. I didn’t want 
the voters smelling them. 

And most of all because of the 
interference that I was sure any 
red-blooded, stubborn-minded, 
confused voter would draw. 
Jeez, Sam, you hear about that 
Arcturan coming to spy on us? 
Yeah, Charley, the damn bugs 
are practically accusing us of 
rigging the election. Damn right, 
Sam, and you know what else? 
They stink, Sam. 

Half an hour later I got a di- 
rect call from Haber. “Gunner, 
boy! Good God! Oh, this is the 
reeking end!” 

I said, “It sounds to me like 
you’ve found out about the Arc- 
turan on the Truce Team.” 

“You know? And you didn’t 
tell me?” 

Well, I had been about to ream 
him for not telling me, but ob- 
viously that wasn’t going to do 
any good. I tried anyway, but he 
fell back on his fat ignorance. 



“They didn’t clue me in from 
Chicago. Can I help that? Be 
fair now, Gunner, boy!” 

Gunner boy very fairly hung 
up. 

I was beginning to feel very 
sleepy. For a moment I debated 
taking a brisk-up pill, but the 
mild buzz Connick’s liquor had 
left with me was pleasant 
enough, and besides it was get- 
ting late. I went to the hotel 
Candace had reserved for me 
and crawled into bed. 

It only took me a few minuter 
to fall asleep, but I was faintly 
aware of an odor. It was the 
same hotel the Truce Team was 
staying at. 

I couldn’t really be smelling 
this Arcturan, Knafti. It was just 
my imagination. That’s what I 
told myself as I dialed for sleep 
and drifted off. 

'T'he pillow-phone hummed 
and Candace’s voice said out 
of it, “Wake up and get decent, 
Gunner, I’m coming up.” 

I managed to sit up, shook my 
head and took a few whiffs of 
amphetamide. As always, it woke 
me right up, but at the usual 
price of feeling that I hadn’t 
had quite enough sleep. Still, I 
got into a robe and was in the 
bathroom fixing breakfast when 
she knocked on the door. “It’s 
open,”I called. “Want some cof- 
fee?” 



172 



GALAXY 



“Sure Gunner.” She came and 
stood in the doorway, watching 
me turn the Hilsch squirt to full 
boil and fill two cups. I spooned 
dry coffee into them and turned 
the squirt to cold. “Orange 
juice?” She took the coffee and 
shook her head, so I just mixed 
one glass, swallowed it down, 
tossed the glass in the disposal 
hamper and took the coffee into 
the other room. The bed had 
stripped itself already : it was 
now a couch, and I leaned back 
on it, drinking my coffee. “All 
right, honey,” 1 said, “What’s 
the dirt on Connick?” 

She hesitated, then opened her 
bag and took out a photofax 
and handed it to me. It was a re- 
production of an old steel-en- 
graving headed, in antique 
script, The Army of the United 
States, and it said, 

Be it known to all men that 
DANIEL T. CONNICK 
ASIN Aj-32880515 

has this date been separated from the 
service of the United States for the 
convenience of the government; and 
Be it further known to all men that 
the conditions of his discharge are 
DISHONORABLE 

“Well, what do you know,” I 
said. “You see, honey? There’s 
always something.” 

Candace finished her coffee, 
set the cup down neatly on a 
windowsill and took out a cig- 
arette. That was like her: she 
always did one thing at a time, 



an orderly sort of mind that I 
couldn’t match — and couldn’t 
stand, either. Undoubtedly she 
knew what I was thinking be- 
cause undoubtedly she was think- 
ing it too; but there wasn’t any 
nostalgia in her voice when she 
said: “You went and saw him 
last night, didn’t you? . And 
you’re still going to knife him?” 
I said, “I’m going to see that 
he is defeated in the election, 
yes. That’s what they pay me 
for. Me and some others.” 

“No, Gunner,” she said, “that’s 
not what M&B pay me for, if 
that’s what you mean, because 
there isn’t that much money.” 
“I got up and went over be- 
side her. “More coffee? No? 
Well, I guess I don’t want any 
either. Honey — ” 

Candace stood up and crossed 
the room, sitting in a straight- 
backed chair. “You wake up all 
of a sudden, don’t you? Don’t 
change the subject. We were 
talking about — ” 

“We were talking,” I told her, 
“about a job that we’re paid to 
do. All right, you’ve done one 
part of it for me, you got me 
what I wanted on Connick.” 

I stopped, because she was 
shaking her head. “I’m not so 
sure I did.” 

“How’s that?” 

“Well, it’s not on the fax, but 
I know why he got his DD. ‘De- 
sertion of hazardous duty.’ On 



THE CHILDREN OF NIGHT 



173 



the Moon, in the U.N. Space 
Force. The year was 1998.” 

I nodded, because I under- 
stood what she was talking about. 
Connick wasn’t the only one. 
Half the Space Force had 
cracked up that year. November. 
A heavy Leonid strike of meteor- 
ites and a solar flare at the same 
time. The Space Force top brass 
had decided they had to crack 
down and asked the U.S. Army 
to court-martial every soldier 
who cut and ran for an under- 
ground shelter, and the Army 
had felt obliged to comply. “But 
most of them got presidential 
clemency,” I said. “He didn’t?” 
Candace shook her head. “He 
didn’t apply.” 

“Urn. Well, it’s still on record.” 
I dismissed the subject. “Some- 
thing else. What about these Chil- 
dren?” 

Candace put out her cigarette 
and stood up. “Why I’m here, 
Gunner. It was on your list. So 
— get dressed.” 

“For what?” 

She grinned. “For my peace 
of mind, for one thing. Also for 
investigating the Children, like 
you say. I’ve made you an op- 
pointment at the hospital in fif- 
ty-five minutes.” 

Y ou have to remember that I 
didn’t know anything about 
the Children except rumors. 
Bless Haber, he hadn’t thought 



it necessary to explain. And 
Candace only said, “Wait till we 
get to the hospital. You’ll see 
for yourself.” 

Donnegan General was seven 
stories of cream-colored ceramic 
brick, air-controlled, wall-lighted 
throughout, tiny asepsis lamps 
sparkling blue where the ventila- 
tion ducts opened. Candace 
parked the car in an under- 
ground garage and led me to 
an elevator, then to a waiting 
room. She seemed to know her 
way around very well. She 
glanced at her watch, told me 
we were a couple of minutes 
early and pointed to a routing 
map that was a mural with col- 
ored lights showing visitors the 
way to whatever might be their 
destination. It also showed, 
quite impressively, the size and 
scope of Donnegan General. The 
hospital had twenty-two fully 
equipped operating rooms, a 
specimen and transplant bank, 
X-ray and radiochemical depart- 
ments, a cryogenics room, the 
most complete prosthesis instal- 
lation on Earth, a geriatrics sec- 
tion, O.T. rooms beyond num- 
ber . 

And, of all things, a fully 
equipped and crowded pediatric 
wing. 

I said, “I thought this was a 
V-A. facility.” 

“Exactly. Here comes our 
boy.” 



174 



GALAXY 



A Navy officer was coming in, 
hand and smile outstretched to 
Candace. “Hi, good to see you. 
And you must be Mr. Gunnar- 

tt 

sen. 

Candace introduced us as we 
shook hands. The fellow’s name 
was Commander Whitling; she 
called him “Tom”. He said, 
“We’ll have to move. Since I 
talked to you there’s been an all- 
hands evolution scheduled for 
eleven — some high brass inspec- 
tion. I don’t want to hurry you, 
but I’d like it if we were out of 
the way . this is a little ir- 
regular.” 

“Nice of you to arrange it,” 
I said. “Lead on.” 

We went up a high-rise ele- 
vator and came out on the top 
floor of the building, into a cor- 
ridor covered with murals of 
Disney and Mother Goose. From 
a sun deck came the tinkle of a 
music box. Three children, chas- 
ing each other down the hall, 
dodged past us, yelling. They 
made pretty good time, consid- 
ering that two of them were on 
crutches. “What the hell are you 
doing here?” asked Commander 
Whitling sharply. 

I looked twice, but he wasn’t 
talking to me or the kids. He was 
talking to a man with a young 
face but a heavy black beard, 
who was standing behind a Don- 
ald Duck mobile looking incon- 
spicuous and guilty. 



“Oh, hi, Mr. Whitling,” the 
man said. “Jeez. I must’ve got 
lost again looking for the PX.” 
“Carhart,” said the commander 
dangerously, “if I catch you in 
this wing again you won’t have 
to worry about the PX for a 
year. Hear me?” 

“Well, jeez. All right, Mr. 
Whitling.” As the man saluted 
and turned, his face wearing an 
expression of injury, I noticed 
that the left sleeve of his bath- 
robe was tucked, empty, into a 
pocket. 

“You can’t keep them out,” 
said Whitling and spread his 
hands. “Well, all right, Mr. Gun- 
narsen, here it is. You’re seeing 
the whole thing.” 

I looked carefully around. It 
was all children — limping chil- 
dren, stumbling children, pale 
children, weary children. “But 
what am I seeing, exactly?” I 
asked. 

“Why, the Children, Mr. Gun- 
narsen. The ones we liberated. 
The ones the Arcturans captured 
on Mars.” 

\ nd then I connected. I re- 
membered about the cap- 
ture of the colony on Mars. 

Interstellar war is waged at 
the pace of a snail’s crawl, be- 
cause it takes so long to go from 
star to star. The main battles of 
our war with Arcturus had been 
fought no farther from Earth 



THE CHILDREN OF NIGHT 



175 



than the surface of Mars and the 
fleet engagement around Orbit 
Saturn. Still, it had taken eleven 
years, first to last, from the sur- 
prise attack on the Martian col- 
ony to the armistice signed at 
Washington. 

I remembered seeing a recon- 
structed tape of that Martian 
surprise attack. It was a sum- 
mer’s day — hot — at full noon, ice 
melted into water. The place was 
the colony around the Southern 
Springs. Out of the small de- 
scending sun a ship appeared. 

It was a rocket. It was bril- 
liant gold metal, and it came 
down with a halo of gold radia- 
tion around its splayed front, 
like the fleshy protuberance of a 
star-nosed mole. It landed with 
an electrical crackle on the fine- 
grained orange sand, and out of 
it came the Arcturans. 

Of course, no one had known 
they were Arcturans then. They 
had swung around the sun in a 
long anecliptic orbit, watching 
and studying, and they had se- 
lected the small Martian outpost 
as the place to strike. In Mars 
gravity they were bipeds — two 
of their ropy limbs were enough 
to lift them off the ground — man 
tall, in golden pressure suits. 
The colonists came running out 
to meet them, and were killed. 
All of them. All of the adults. 

The children, however, had not 
been killed, not that quickly or 



that easily, at least. Some had 
not been killed at all, and some 
of those were here in Donnegan 
General Hospital. 

But not all. 

Comprehension beginning to 
emerge in my small mind I said, 
“Then these are the survivors.” 
Candace, standing very close 
to me, said, “Most of them, 
Gunner. The ones that aren’t 
well enough to be sent back in- 
to normal life.” 

“And the others?” 

“Well, they mostly don’t have 
families — having been killed, 
you see. So they’ve been adopted 
out into foster-homes here in 
Belport. A hundred and eight of 
them, isn’t that right, Tom? And 
now maybe you get some idea of 
what you’re up against.” 

sphere was something like a 
hundred of the Children in 
that wing, and I didn’t see all of 
them. Some of them were not 
to be seen. 

Whitling just told me about, 
but couldn’t show me, the blood- 
temperature room, where the 
very young and very bad cases 
lived. They had a gnotobiotic 
atmosphere, a little rich in oxy- 
gen, a little more humid than the 
ambient air, plus pressure to 
help their weak metabolism keep 
oxygen spread in their parts. On 
their right, a little farther along, 
were the small individual rooms 



176 



GALAXY 



belonging to the worst cases of 
all. The contagious. The incur- 
ables. The unfortunates whose 
very appearance was bad for the 
others. Whitling was good enough 
to open polarizing shutters and 
let me look in on some of those 
where they lay (or writhed, or 
stood like sticks) in permanent 
solitary. One of the Arcturan ef- 
forts had been transplantation, 
and the project seemed to have 
been directed by a whimsical 
person. The youngest was about 
three; the oldest in late teens. 

They were a disturbing lot, 
and if I have glossed lightly over 
what I felt, it is because what I 
felt is all too obvious. 

Kids in trouble! Of course, 
those who had been put back 
into population weren’t put back 
shocking as these. But they 
would pull at the heartstrings, 
they even pulled at mine; and 
every time a foster-parent, or a 
foster-parent’s neighbor, or a 
casual passer-by on the street, 
felt that heartstring tug he would 
feel, too, a single thought: The 
Arcturans did this. 

For after killing the potentially 
dangerous adults they had caged 
the tractable small ones as val- 
uable research specimens. 

And I had hoped to counteract 
this with five hundred Arcturan 
pets! 

Whitling was all this time 
taking me around the wing, and 



I could hear in his voice the 
sound of what I was up against; 
because he loved and pitied those 
kids. “Hi, Terry,” he said on the 
sun- deck, bending over a bed 
and patting its occupant on his 
snow-white hair. Terry smiled 
up at him. “Can’t hear us, of 
course,” said Whitling. “We 
grafted in new auditory nerves 
four weeks ago — I did it myself 
— but they’re not surviving. 
Third try, too. And of course, 
each attempt is a worse risk than 
the one before; antibodies.” 

I said, “He doesn’t look more 
than five years old.” Whitling 
nodded. “But the attack on the 
colony was — ” 

“Oh, I see what you mean,” 
said Whitling. “The Arcturans 
were, of course, interested in re- 
production too. Ellen — she left 
us a couple of weeks ago — was 
only thirteen, but she’d had six 
children. Now, this is Nancy.” 

Nancy was perhaps twelve, 
but her gait and arm coordina- 
tion were those of a toddler. She 
came stumbling in after a ball, 
stopped and regarded me with 
dislike and suspicion. “Nancy’s 
one of our cures,” Whitling said 
proudly. He followed my eyes. 
“Oh, nothing wrong there,” he 
said. “Mars-bred. She hasn’t ad- 
justed to Earth gravity, is all; 
she isn’t slow, the ball’s bouncing 
too fast. Here’s Sam.” 

Sam was a near-teen-ager, gig- 

177 



THE CHILDREN OF NIGHT 



gling from his bed as he tried 
what was obviously the extreme- 
ly wearing exercise of lifting his 
head off the mattress. A candy- 
striped practical nurse was count- 
ing time for him as he touched 
chin to chest, one and two, one 
and two. He did it five times, 
then slumped back, grinning. 
“Sam’s central nervous system 
was almost gone,” Whitling said 
fondly. “But we’re making pro- 
gress. Nervous tissue regenera- 
tion, though, is awfully — ” I 
wasn’t listening; I was looking 
at Sam’s grin, which showed 
black and broken teeth. “Diet 
deficiency,” said Whitling, fol- 
lowing my look again. 

“All right,” I said, “I’ve seen 
enough, now I want to get out 
of here before they have me 
changing diapers. I thank you, 
Commander Whitling. I think I 
thank you. Which way is out?” 

IV 

T didn’t want to go back to Ha- 

ber’s office. I was afraid of 
what the conversation might be 
like. But I had to get a fill-in 
on what had been happening 
with our work and I had to eat. 

So I took Candace back to my 
room and ordered lunch from 
room service. 

I stood at the thermal window 
looking out at the city while 
Candace checked with the office. 



I didn’t even listen, because 
Candace knev/ what I would 
want to know, I just watched 
Belport cycle through an average 
dull Monday at my feet. Bel- 
port was a radial town, with an 
urban center-cluster of the mush- 
room-shaped buildings that were 
popular twenty years ago. The 
hotel we were in was one, in 
fact, and from my window I 
could see three others looming 
above and below me, to right 
and left, and beyond them the 
cathedral spires of the apart- 
ment condominia of the residen- 
tial districts. I could see a creep- 
ing serpent of gaily colored cars 
moving along one of the traffic- 
ways, pinpointed with sparks of 
our pro-referendum campaign 
parades. Or one of the opposi- 
tion’s. From four hundred feet 
it didn’t seem to matter. 

“You know, honey,” I said as 
she clicked off the 3-V, “there 
isn’t any sense to this. I admit 
the kids are sad cases, and who 
can resist kids in trouble? But 
they don’t have one solitary 
damned thing to do with whether 
or not the Arcturans should have 
a telemetry and tracking station 
out on the lake.” 

Candace said, “Weren’t you 
the man who told me that logic 
didn’t have anything to do with 
public relations?” She came to 
the window beside me, turned 
and half-sat on the ledge and 



178 



GALAXY 



read from her notes: “Survey 
index off another half-point . 
Haber says, be sure to tell you 
that’s a victory, would have have 
been off two points at least with- 
out the Arcats. Supplier letters 
out. Chicago approves budget 
overdraft. And that’s all that 
matters.” 

“Thanks.” The door chimed, 
and she left me to let the bell- 
men in with our lunch. I watched 
her without much appetite, ex- 
cept maybe for the one thing that 
I knew wasn’t on the menu, 
Candace herself. But I tried to 
eat. 

Candace did not seem to be 
trying to help me eat. In fact, 
she did something that was quite 
out of character for her. All the 
way through lunch she kept talk- 
ing, and the one subject she kept 
talking about was the kids. I 
heard about Nina, who was fif- 
teen when she came to Donnegan 
General and had been through 
the occupation all the way — who 
wouldn’t talk to anybody, and 
weighed fifty-one pounds, and 
screamed unless she was allowed 
to hide under the bed. “And af- 
ter six months,” said Candace, 
“they gave her a hand-puppet, 
and she finally talked through 
that” 

“How’d you find all this out?” 
I asked. 

“From Tom. And then there 
were the germ-free kids . 



She told me about them, and 
about the series of injections 
and marrow transplants that they 
had needed to restore the body’s 
immune reaction without killing 
the patient. And the ones with 
auditory and vocal nerves de- 
stroyed, apparently because the 
Arcturans were investigating the 
question of whether humans 
could think rationally in the ab- 
sence of articulate words. The 
ones raised on chemically pure 
glucose for dietary studies. The 
induced bleeders. The kids with 
no sense of touch, and the kids 
with no developed musculature. 

“Tom told you all this?” 

“And lots more, Gunner. And 
remember, these are the surviv- 
ors. Some of the kids who were 
deliberately — ” 

“How long have you known 
Tom?” 

She put down her fork, sug- 
ared her coffee and took a sip, 
looking at me over the cup. “Oh, 
since I’ve been here. Two years. 
Since before the kids came, of 
course.” 

“Pretty well, I judge.” 

“Oh, yes.” 

“He really likes those kids, I 
could see that. And so do you.” I 
swallowed some more of my own 
coffee, which tasted like diluted 
pig swill, and reached for a cig- 
arette and said, “I think maybe I 
waited too long about the situa- 
tion here, wouldn’t you say?” 



THE CHILDREN OF NIGHT 



179 



“Why, yes, Gunner,” she said 
carefully, “I think you maybe 
missed the boat.” 

“I tell you what else I think, 
honey. I think you’re trying to 
tell me something, and it isn’t 
all about Proposition Four on 
the ballot next week.” 

And she said, not irrelevantly, 
“As a matter of fact, Gunner, 
I’m going to marry Tom Whit- 
ling on Christmas day.” 

T sent her back to the office and 
stretched out on my bed, smok- 
ing and watching the smoke be- 
ing sucked into the wall-vents. 
It was rather peaceful and quiet 
because I’d told the desk to hold 
all calls until further notice, and 
I wasn't feeling a thing. 

Perfection is so rare, it is in- 
teresting to find a case in which 
one has been perfectly wrong all 
the way. 

If I had taken out my little list 
then I could have checked off 
all the points. One way or an- 
other. I hadn’t fired Haber, and 
in fact I really didn’t want to 
any more, because he wasn’t 
much worse than I was at this 
particular job; the record showed 
it. I had investigated the Chil- 
dren, all right. A little late. I had 
investigated Connick, the num- 
ber one opponent to the proposi- 
tion, and what I had found would 
hurt Connick, all right, but I 
couldn’t really see how it would 



help do our job. And I certainly 
wasn’t going to marry Candace 
Harmon. 

Come to think of it, I thought, 
lighting another cigarette from 
the stub of the old one, there 
had been a fifth item, and I had 
blown that one too. 

The classics of public relations 
clearly show how little reason 
has to do with M/R, and yet I 
had allowed myself to fall into 
that oldest and most imbecilic of 
traps set for flacks. Think of his- 
tory’s masterstrokes of flackery: 
“The Jews stabbed Germany in 
the back!” “Seventy-eight (or 
fifty-nine, or one hundred and 
three) card-carrying communists 
in the State Department!” “I 
will go to Korea!” It is not 
enough for a theme to be ration- 
al ; indeed it is wrong for a theme 
to be rational, if you want to 
move men’s glands, because, 
above all else, it must seem new, 
and fresh, and of such revolu- 
tionary simplicity that it illum- 
inates an enormous, confused and 
disagreeable problem in a fresh 
and hopeful light. Or so it must 
seem to the Average Man. And 
since he has spent any number 
of surly, worried hours groping 
for some personal salvation in 
the face of a bankrupt Germany, 
or a threat of subversion, or a 
war that is going nowhere, no 
rational solution can ever meet 
those strictures . since he has 



180 



GALAXY 



already considered all the ra- 
tional solutions and found either 
that they are useless or that the 
cost is more than he wants to 
pay. 

So what I should have con- 
centrated on in Belport was the 
bright, irrational, distractive is- 
sue. The Big Lie, if you will. And 
I had hardly found even a Sly 
Insinuation. 

It was interesting to consider 
in just how many ways I had 
done the wrong thing. Including 
maybe the wrongest of all : I had 
let Candace Harmon get away. 
And then in these thoughts, my- 
self almost despising, haply the 
door chimed and I opened it, 
and there was this fellow in 
Space Force olive-greens saying, 
“Come along, Mr. Gunnarsen, 
the Truce Team want to talk to 
you.” 

TT'or one frozen moment there, I 
was nineteen years old again. 
I was a Rocketman 3/c on the 
Moon, guarding the Aristarchus 
base against invaders from outer 
space. (We thought that to be 
a big joke at the time. Shows 
how unfunny a joke can turn.) 
This fellow was a colonel, and 
his name was Peyroles, and he 
took me down the corridor, to 
a private elevator I had never 
known was there, up to the flat 
dome of the mushroom and into 
a suite which made my suite 



look like the cellar under a dog- 
run in Old Levittown. The reek 
was overpowering. By then I had 
gotten over my quick response 
to the brass and I took out a 
ker-pak and held it to my nose. 
The colonel did not even look at 
me. 

“Sit down!” barked the colonel, 
and left me in front of an un- 
lighted fireplace. Something was 
going on; I could hear voices 
from another room, a lot of them ; 

“ — burned one in effigy, and 
by God we’ll burn a real one — ” 
“ — smells like a skunk — ” 

“ — turns my stomach!” And 
that last fellow, whoever he was, 
was pretty near right, at that — 
although actually in the few sec- 
onds since I entered the suite I 
had almost forgotten the smell. 
It was funny how you got used 
to it. Like a ripe cheese; The 
first whiff knocked you sick, but 
pretty soon the olfactory nerves 
got the hang of the thing and 
built up a defense. 

“ — all right, the war’s over 
and we have to get along with 
them, but a man’s home town — ” 
Whatever it was that was going 
on in the other room, it was go- 
ing on loudly. Tempers were al- 
ways short when Arcturans were 
around, because the smell, of 
course, put everybody on edge. 
People don’t like bad smells. 
They’re not nice. They remind 
us of sweat and excrement, which

we have buttressed our lives 
against admitting as real, person- 
al facts. Then there was a loud 
military yell for order — I recog- 
nized the colonel, Peyroles — 
and then a voice that sounded 
queerly not-quite-human, al- 
thought it spoke in English. An 
Arcturan? What was his name, 
Knafti? But I had understood 
they comun’t make human 
sounds. 

Whoever it was, he put an end 
to the meeting. The door opened. 

Through it I could see a couple 
of dozen hostile backs, leaving 
through another door, and com- 
ing toward me the Space Force 
colonel, a very young man with 
a pale, angel’s face and a drag- 
ging limp, in civilian clothes . 
and, yes, and the Arcturan. It 
was the first one I had ever been 
with at so close range, in so small 
a group. He wobbled toward me 
on four or six of his coat-hanger 
limbs, breathing-thorax encased 
in a golden shell, his mantis face 
and bright black eyes staring at 
me. 

Peyroles closed the door be- 
hind them. 

He turned to me and said, 
“Mr. Gunnarsen . Knafti . 
Timmy Brown.” 

I hadn’t the ghost of a clue 
whether to offer to shake, and if 
so, with what. Knafti however 
merely regarded me gravely. The 
boy nodded. I said: “I’m glad to 



meet you, gentlemen. As you 
perhaps know, I tried to set up 
an appointment before but your 
people turned me down. I take 
it now the shoe is on the other 
foot.” 

Colonel Peyroles frowned to- 
ward the door he had just shut 
— there were still noises behind 
it — but said to me, “You’re 
quite right. That was a meeting 
of a civic leaders’ committee — ” 

The door interrupted him by 
opening, and a man leaned 
through and yelled: “Peyroles! 
Can that thing understand white 
man’s talk? I hope so. I hope it 
hears me when I say that I’m 
going to make it my personal 
business to take it apart if it’s 
still in Belport this time tomor- 
row. And if any human being, or 
so-called human being like you, 
gets in the way, I’ll take him 
apart too!” He slammed the door 
without waiting for an answer. 

“You see?” said Peyroles gruff- 
ly, angrily. Things like that 
would never have happened with 
well-tempered troops. “That’s 
what we want to talk to you 
about.” 

“I see,” I said, and I did see, 
very clearly, because that fel- 
low who had leaned through the 
door had been the Arcturan- 
property-sale standard bearer we 
had counted on, old — what had 
Connick called him? — old Slits- 
and-Fits Schlitz, the man we 



182 



GALAXY 



were attempting to elect to get 
our proposition through. 

J udging by the amount of noise 
I’d heard from the citizens’ 
delegation, there was lynch in 
the atmosphere. I could under- 
stand why they would reverse 
themselves and ask for me, be- 
fore things got totally out of con- 
trol and wound up in murder, if 
you call killing an Arcturan mur- 
der — 

— although, it occurred to me, 
lynching Knafti might not be the 
worst thing that could happen; 
public sentiment might bounce 
back — 

I shoved that thought out of 
my mind and got down to busi- 
ness. “What, exactly?” I asked. 
“I gather you want me to do 
something about your image.” 
Knafti sat himself down, if 
that’s what Arcturans do, on an 
entwining-rack. The pale boy 
whispered sofnething to him, 
then came to me. “Mr. Gunnar- 
sen,” he said, “I am Knafti.” He 
spoke with a great precision of 
vowels and a stress at the end 
of each sentence, as though he 
had learned English out of a 
handbook. I had no trouble in 
understanding him. At least, not 
in understanding what it was he 
said. It did take me a moment to 
comprehend what he meant; and 
then Peyroles had to help. 

“He means at this moment 



he’s speaking for Knafti,” said 
the colonel. “Interpreter. See?" 

The boy moved his lips for a 
moment — shifting gears, it seem- 
ed — and said, “That is right, I 
am Timmy Brown. Knaiti’s 
translator and assistant.” 

“Then ask Knafti what he 
wants from me.” I tried to say it 
the way he had — a sort of 
sneeze for the “K” and an in- 
describable whistle for the “F.” 
Timmy Brown moved his lips 
again and said, “I, Knafti, wish 
you to stop ... to leave ... to 
discontinue your operation in 
Belport.” 

From the twining-tree, the 
Arcturan waved his ropy limbs 
and chittered like a squirrel. The 
boy chirped back and said: “I, 
Knafti, commend you on your 
effective work, but stop it.” 
“By which,” rumbled Colonel 
Peyroles, “he means knock it 
off.” 

“Go fight a space war, Pey- 
roles. Timmy — I mean, Knafti, 
this is the job I’m paid to do. 
The Arcturan Confederacy itself 
hired us. I take my orders from 
Arthur S. Bigelow, Jr., and I 
carry them out whether Knafti 
likes it or not.” 

Chirp and chitter between 
Knafti and the pale, limping boy. 
The Arcturan left his twining- 
tree and moved to the window, 
looking out into the sky and the 
copter traffic. Timmy Brown 



THE CHILDREN OF NIGHT 



183 



said: “It doer, not matter what 
your orders may be, I, Knafti, 
tell you that your work is harm- 
ful.” He hesitated, mumbling to 
himself. “We do not wish to ob- 
tain our base here at the cost 
of what is true, and — ” he turn- 
ed imploringly to the Arcturan 
— “and it is apparent you are 
attempting to change the truth.” 
He chirped at the Arcturan, 
who took his blind black eyes 
from the window and came to- 
ward us. Arcturans don’t walk, 
exactly. They drag themselves on 
the lower part of the thorax. 
Their limbs are supple and thin, 
and what are not used for sup- 
port are used for gestures. Knaf- 
ti used a number of his now, as 
he chirped one short series of 
sounds at the boy. 

“ — Otherwise,” Timmy Brown 
finished off, “I, Knafti, tell you 
we will have to fight this war 
over again.” 

A s soon as I was back in my 
*- room I messaged Chicago 
for orders and clarification and 
got back the answer I expected: 
Hold everything. Referring mat- 
ter to ASB-jr. Await instructions. 

So I awaited. The way I await- 
ed was to call Candace at the of- 
fice and get the latest sitrep. I 
told her about the near-riot in 
the Truce Team’s suite and ask- 
ed her what it was all about. She 
shook her head. “We have their 

184 



appointments schedule. Gunner. 
It just says ‘Meeting with civic 
leaders.’ But one of the leaders 
has a secretary who goes to 
lunch with a girl from Records 
8s Accounting here and — ” 

“And you’ll find out. All right, 
do that, and now what’s the cur- 
rent picture?” 

She began reading off brief- 
ing digests and field reports. 
They were mixed, but not al- 
together bad. Opinion sampling 
showed a small rise in favor- 
ability toward the Arcturans, in 
fact. It wasn’t much, but it was 
the first plus change I had seen, 
and doubly puzzling because of 
Knafti’s attitude and the brawl 
with the civic leaders. I asked, 
“Why, honey?” 

Candace’s face in the screen 
was as puzzled as mine. “We’re 
still digging.” 

“All right. Go on.” 

There were more pluses. The 
Flower Fair had yielded sur- 
prisingly big profits in attitudes 
— among those who attended. 
Of course, they were only a tiny 
fraction of the population of Bel- 
port. The Arcats were showing 
a plus for us, too. Where we 
were down was in PTA meeting 
resolutions, in resignations from 
Candace’s Arcturan-American 
Friendship League, in poor at- 
tendance at neighborhood coffee- 
klatsches. 

Now that I knew what to look 

GALAXY 



for, I could see what the Chil- 
dren had done to us. In every 
family-situation sampling, the 
attitudes were measurably worse 
than when the subjects were in- 
terviewed in a non-family en- 
vironment — at work, stopped on 
the street, in a theater. 

The importance of that was 
just what I had told Connick. No 
man is a simple entity. He be- 
haves one way when his self- 
image is as head of a family, an- 
other when he is at a cocktail 
party, another at work, another 
still when a pretty girl sits down 
beside him on a commuter-cop- 
ter. Elementary truths. But it 
had taken the M/R boys half a 
century to learn how to use them. 

In this case the use was clear: 
Play down family elements, play 
up play. I ordered more floats, 
torchlight parades and a teen-age 
beauty contest. I canceled the 
fourteen picnic rallies we had 
planned and ordered a hold on 
the coffee-klatsches. 

I was not exactly obeying Chi- 
cago’s orders. But it didn’t mat- 
ter. All this could be canceled 
with a single word, and anyway 
it was only nit-picking detail. 
The One Big Weeny still escaped 
me. 

I lit a cigarette, thought for a 
minute and said, “Honey get me 
some of the synoptic extracts of 
opinion-sampling from heads of 
families and particularly families 



containing some of the Children. 
I don’t want the integration or 
anaylsis. Just the raw interviews 
but with the scutwork left out.” 

And as soon as she was off the 
line the Chicago circuit came in 
with a message they’d been 
holding : 

Query from ASB-jr. Provided 
top is taken off budget and your 
hand is freed, can you guarantee, 
repeat guarantee, win on refer- 
endum question? 

Tt was not the response I had 
expected from them. 

Still, it was a legitimate ques- 
tion. I took a moment to think 
it over. 

Junior Bigelow had already 
given me a pretty free hand — 
as he always did; how else can 
a troubleshooter work? If he 
was now emphasizing that my 
hand was freed entirely, it would 
not be because he thought I 
hadn’t understood him in the 
first place. Nor would it be be- 
cause he suspected I might be 
cheese-paring secretarial salaries. 
He meant one thing: Win, no 
matter what. 

Under those conditions, could 
I do it? 

Well, of course I could win. 
Yes. Provided I found the One 
Big Weeny. You can always win 
an election, any election any- 
where, provided you are willing 
to pay the right price. 



THE CHILDREN OF NIGHT 



185 



It was finding the price to pay 
that was hard. Not just money. 
Sometimes the price you pay is 
a human being, in the role for 
which I had been lining up Con- 
nick. Throw a human sacrifice 
to the gods and your prayer is 
granted ... 

But was Connick the sacrifice 
the gods wanted? Would it help 
to defeat him, bearing in mind 
that his opponent was one of the 
men who had been screaming at 
Knafti in the Truce Team suite? 
And if so — had my knife enough 
edge to drain his blood? 

Well, it always had had before. 
And if Connick wasn’t the right 
man, I would find the man who 
was. I messaged back, short and 
sweet, Yes. 

And in less than a minute, as 
though Junior had been standing 
by at the faxtape receiver, wait- 
ing for the word from me — and 
perhaps he had! — his reply 
came back: 

Gunner, we’ve lost the Arc- 
turan Confederacy account. Arc 
Con liaison man says all bets off. 
They’re giving notice of cancel- 
lation our contract, suggestion 
they will cancel entire armistice 
treaty too. I don’t have to tell 
you we need them. Some pos- 
sibility that showing strong re- 
sults in Belport will get them 
hack. That’s what we have to 
play for. No holds barred, Gun- 
ner, win that election. 



nphe office circuit chimed then. 

Probably it was Candace, 
but I didn’t want to talk to her 
just then. I turned all the com- 
munication circuits to “hold”, 
stripped down, climbed into the 
shower, set it for full needle 
spray and let the water beat 
on me. It was not an aid to 
thought, it was a replacement for 
thought. v 

I didn’t want to think any 
more. I wanted time out. 

I did not want to think about 
(a) whether the war would break 
out again, and, if so, in what de- 
gree I would have helped to bring 
that about; (b) what I was do- 
ing to Nice Guy Connick; (c) 
whether It Was All Worth It or 
(d) how much I was going to 
dislike myself that coming 
Christmas day. I only wanted to 
let the hot splash of scented 
foaming water anesthetize me. 
When my skin began to look 
pale and wrinkly, although I had 
not come to any conclusions or 
found any solutions, I came out, 
dressed, opened the communica- 
tions circuits and let them all be- 
gin blinking, ringing and wink- 
ing at once. 

I took Candace first. She said, 
“Gunner! Dear lord, have you 
heard about the Armistice Com- 
mission? They’ve just released 
a statement — ” 

“I heard. What else, honey?” 
Good girl, she shifted gears 



186 



GALAXY 



without missing a beat. “Then 
there was that meeting of civic 

leaders in the Truce Team suite 
» 

“I saw. Feedback from the 
Armistice Commission’s state- 
ment. What else?” 

She glanced at the papers in 
her hand, hesitated, then said: 
“Nothing important. Uh, Gun- 
ner. That 3-V preempt for to- 
night — ” 

“Yeah, honey?” 

“Do you want me to cancel it?” 
I said, “No. You’re right, we 
won’t use the time for the 
Arcturan- American Friendship 
League or whatever we had 
scheduled, but you’re wrong, 
we’ll use the time some way. I 
don’t know how right now.” 

“But Junior said — ” 

“Honey,” I told her. “Junior 
says all sorts of things. Anybody 
looking to scalp me?” 

“Well,” she said, “There’s Mr. 
Connick. I didn’t think you’d 
want to see him.” 

“No, I’ll see him. I’ll see any- 
body.” 

“Anybody?” I had surprised 
her. She dived into her list again. 
“There’s somebody from the 
Truce Team — ” 

“Make it everybody from the 
Truce Team.” 

“ — and Commander Whitling 
from — ” 

“From the hospital. Sure, and 
tell him to bring some kids.” 



“ — and . She trailed off 
and looked at me. “Gunner, are 
you putting me on? You don’t 
really want to see all these peo- 
ple.” 

I smiled and reached out and 
patted the viewphone. From her 
point of view it would look like 
an enormous cloudy hand dor, '■< 
in on her screen, but she would 
know what I meant. I said, “You 
could not be more wrong. I do. 
I want to see them all, the more 
the better, and the way I’d like 
to see them best is in my office, 
all at once. So set it up, hone- 
because I’ll be busy between now 
and then.” 

“Busy doing what, Gunner?” 
“Busy trying to think of what 
I want to see them for.” And I 
turned off the viewphone, got up 
and walked out, leaving the 
others gobbling into emptiness 
behind me. What I needed was 
a long, long walk, and I took it. 

\\ Then I was tired of walking 
* ^ I went to the office and 
evicted Haber from his private 
quarters. I kept him standing by 
what had once been his own desk 
while I checked with Candace 
and found that she had made all 
my appointments for that eve- 
ning, then I told him to get lost. 
“And thanks,” I said. 

He paused on his way to the 
door. “For what, Gunner?” 

“For a very nice office to kill 

187 



THE CHILDREN OF NIGHT 



time in.” I waved at the furnish- 
ings. “I wondered what you’d 
spent fifty grand on when I saw 
the invoices in the Chicago of- 
fice, Haber, and I admit I 
thought there might have been a 
little padding. But I was wrong.” 

He said woundedly: “Gunner, 
boy! I wouldn’t do anything like 
that.” 

“I believe you. Wait a minute.” 
I thought for a second, then told 
him to send in some of the tech- 
nical people and not to let any- 
body, repeat anybody, disturb 
me for any purpose whatever. I 
scared him good, too. He left a 
shaken man, a little angry, a lit- 
tle admiring, a little excited in- 
side, I think, at the prospect of 
seeing how the great man would 
get himself out of this one. Mean- 
while the great man talked brief- 
ly to the technicians, took a ten- 
minute nap, drank the Martinis 
out of his dinner tray and pitch- 
ed the rest of it in the dispos-all. 

Then, as I had nearly an hour 
before the appointments Can- 
dace had set up for me, I scroung- 
ed around fat-cat Haber’s office 
to see what entertainment it of- 
fered. 

There were his files. I glanced 
at them and forgot them; there 
was nothing about the hoarded 
memoranda that interested me, 
not even for gossip. There were 
the books on his shelf. But I did 
not care to disturb the patina of 



dust that even the cleaning ma- 
chines had not been able to 
touch. There was his private bar, 
and the collection of photographs 
in the end compartment of his 
desk drawer. 

It looked like very dull times 
waiting, until the studio men re- 
ported in that they had com- 
pleted their arrangements at my 
request, and the 3-V tape-effects 
monitor could now be controlled 
by remote from my desk, and 
then I knew I had a pleasant 
way of killing any amount of 
time. 

Have you ever played with the 
console of a 3-V monitor, back- 
ed by a library of tape-effects 
strips? It is very much like be- 
ing God. 

All that the machine does is 
take the stored videotapes that 
are in its files and play them 
back. But it also manipulates 
size and perspective or superim- 
poses one over another ... so 
that you can, as I in fact have 
done, put the living person of 
someone you don’t like in a posi- 
tion embarrassing to him, and 
project it on a montage screen so 
that only a studio tech can find 
the dots on the pattern where the 
override betrays its presence. 

Obviously, this is a way out of 
almost any propaganda difficul- 
ty, since it is child’s play to make 
up any event you like and give 
it the seeming of reality. 



188 



GALAXY 



Of course, everybody knows 
it can be done. So the evidence 
of one’s own eyes is not longer 
quite enough, even for a voter. 
And the laws can cut you down. 
I had thought of whomping up 
some frightful frame around 
Connick, for example. But it 
wouldn’t work; no matter when 
I did it there would still be time 
for the other side to spread the 
word of an electoral fraud, and 
a hoax of this magnitude would 
make its own way onto the front 
pages. So I used the machine 
for something much more inter- 
esting to me. I used it as a toy. 

I started by dialing the lunar 
base at Aristarchus for back- 
ground, found a corps of Rocket- 
man marching off in the long 
lunar step, patched my own face 
onto one of the helmeted figures 
and zoomed in and out with the 
imaginary camera, watching 
R3/c Odin Gunnarsen as a boy 
of nineteen, scared witless but 
doing his job. He was a pretty 
nice boy, I thought objectively, 
and wondered what had gone 
wrong with him later. I abandon- 
ed that and sought for other 
amusements. I found Candace’s 
images on tape in the files and 
pleasured myself with her for a 
time. Her open, friendly face 
gave some dignity to the fan- 
tastic bodies of half a dozen 3-V 
strippers in the files; but I 
stopped that child’s game. 



I looked for a larger scope. I 
spread the whole panoply of the 
heavens across the screen of the 
tape machine. I sought out the 
crook of the Big Dipper’s handle, 
traced its arc across half the 
heavens until I located orange 
Arcturus. Then I zoomed in on 
the star, as littler stars grew 
larger and hurtled out of range 
around it, sought its seven gray- 
green planets and located num- 
ber five among them, the watery 
world that Knafti had spawned 
upon. I bade the computing mind 
inside the tape machine recon- 
struct the events of the orbit 
bombing for me, and watched 
hell-bombs splash enormous 
mushrooms of poisonous foam 
into the Arcturan sky, whipping 
the island cities with tidal waves 
and drowning them in death. 

Then I destroyed the whole 
planet. I turned Arcturan into a 
nova and watched the hot driven 
gases sphere out to embrace the 
planet, boil its seas, slag its cities 
. and found myself sweating. 

I ordered another drink from 
the dispenser and switched the 
machine off. And then I became 
aware that the pale blue light 
over the door to Haber’s office 
was glowing insistently. It was 
time; my visitors had arrived. 

C onnick had brought his kids 
along, three of them; the 
lover from Donnegan General 



THE CHILDREN OF NIGHT 



189 



had brought two more; Ilnafti 
and Colonel Peyroles had Tim- 
my Brown. “Welcome to Romp- 
er Room,” I said. “They’re 
making lynch mobs young this 
year.” 

They all yelled at me at once 
— or all but Knafti, whose tweet- 
ing chitter just didn’t have the 
volume to compete. I listened, 
and when they showed signs of 
calming down I reached into fat 
cat Huber’s booze drawer and 
poured myself a stiff one and 
said, “All right, which of you 
creeps want first crack?” And 
they boiled up again while I 
drank my drink. All of them, ex- 
cept Candace Harmon, who only 
stood by the door and looked at 
me. 

So I said, “All right, Connick. 
you first. Are you going to make 
me spread it all over the news- 
casts that you had a dishonor- 
able discharge? . And by the 
way, maybe you’d like to meet 
my assistant blackmailer; Miss 
Harmon over there dug up the 
dirt on you.” 

Her boy friend yelped, but 
Candace just went on looking. 
I didn’t look back, but kept my 
eyes on Connick. He squinted 
his eyes, put his hands in his 
pockets and said, with consider- 
able self-restraint, “You know I 
was only seventeen years old 
when that happened.” 

“Oh, sure. I know more. You 



had a nervous breakdown the 
year after your discharge, space 
cafard, as they call it on the 
soapies. Yellow fever is what we 
called it on the Moon.” 

He glanced quickly at his kids, 
the two that were his own and 
the one that was not, and said 
rapidly: “You know I could have 
had that DD reversed — ” 

“But you didn’t. The signifi- 
cant fact isn’t that you deserted. 
The significant fact is that you 
were loopy. And, I’d say, still 
are.” 

Timmy Brown stuttered: “One 
moment. I, Knafti, have asked 
that you cease — ” 

But Connick brushed him 
aside. “Why, Gunnarsen?” 

“Because I intend to win this 
election. I don’t care what it costs 
— especially what it costs you.” 
“But, I, Knafti, have instruct- 
ed — ” That was Timmy Brown 
trying again. 

“The Armistice Commission 
issued orders — ” That was Pey- 
roles. 

“I don’t know which is worse, 
you or the bugs!” And that was 
Candace’s little friend from the 
hospital, and they all were talk- 
ing at once again. Even Knafti 
came dragging toward me on his 
golden slug’s belly, chirruping 
and hooting, and Timmy Brown 
was actually weeping as he tried 
to tell me I was wrong, I had to 
stop, the whole thing was against 



190 



GALAXY 



orders and why wouldn’t I de- 
sist? 

I shouted: “Shut up, all of 
you!” 

They didn’t, but the volume 
level dropped minutely. I rode 
over it: “What the hell do I care 
what any of you want? I’m paid 
to do a job. My job is to make 
people act a certain way. I do it. 
Maybe tomorrow I’ll be paid to 
make them act the opposite way, 
and I’ll do that, too. Anyway, 
who the hell are you to order me 
around? A stink-bug like you, 
Knafti? A GI quack like your- 
self, Wliitling? Or you, Connick. 
A—” 

“A candidate for public office,” 
he said clearly. And I give him 
much mana; he didn’t shout, but 
he talked right over me. “And as 
such I have an obligation — ” 

But I out-yelled him anyway. 
“Candidate! You’re a candidate 
right up to till the minute I tell 
the voters you’re a nut, Connick. 
And then you’re dead ! And I will 
tell them, I promise, if — ” 

I didn’t get a chance to finish 
that sentence, because all three 
of Connick’s kids were diving at 
me, his own two and the other 
one. They sent papers flying off 
Haber’s desk and smashed his 
sand-crystal decanter; but they 
didn’t get to my throat, where 
they clearly were aimed, because 
Connick and Timmy Brown 
dragged them back. Not easily. 



I allowed myself a sneer .“And 
what does that prove? Your kids 
like you, I admit — even the one 
from Mars. The one that Knafti’s 
people used for vivisection — 
that Knafti himself worked over, 
likely as not. Nice picture, right? 
Your bug-buddy there, killing 
babies, destroying kids ... or 
didn’t you know that Knafti him- 
self was one of the boss bugs on 
the baby-killing project?” 

Timmy Brown shrieked wild- 
ly, “You don’t know what you 
are doing. It was not Knafti’s 
fault at all!” His ashen face was 
haggard, his rotten teeth bared 
in a grimace. And he was weep- 
ing. 

Tf you apply heat to a single 
molecule it will take off like 
a tom with a spark under his tail, 
but you cannot say where it will 
go. If you heat a dozen mole- 
cules they will fling out in all 
directions, but you still do not 
know which directions they will 
be. If, however, you heat a few 
billion, about as many as are in 
a thimble of dilute gas, you 
know where they will go: they 
will expand. Mass action. You 
can’t tell what a single molecule 
may do — call it the molecule’s 
free will, if you like — but mass- 
es obey mass laws. Masses of 
anything; even so small a mass 
as the growling troop that con- 
fronted me in Haber’s office. I

let them yell, and all the yelling 
was at me. Even Candace was 
showing the frown and the dark- 
ening of the eyes and the work- 
ing of the lips, although she 
watched me as silently and stead- 
ily as ever. 

Connick brought it to a head: 
“All right, everybody,” he yell- 
ed, “now listen to me! Let’s get 
this thing straightened out!” 

He stood up, a child gripped 
by each elbow and the third, the 
youngest, trapped between him 
and the door. He looked at me 
with such loathing that I could 
feel it — and didn’t like it, either, 
although it was no more than I 
had expected, and he said: “It’s 
true. Sammy, here, was one of 
the kids from Mars. Maybe that 
has made me think things I 
shouldn’t have thought — he’s 
my kid now, and when I think 
of those stinkbugs cutting — ” 

He stopped himself and turn- 
ed to Knafti. “Well, I see some- 
thing. A man who would do a 
thing like that would be a fiend. 
I’d cut his heart out with my 
bare hands. But you aren’t a 
man.” 

Grimly he let go of the kids 
and strode toward Knafti. “I 
can’t forgive you. God help me, 
it isn’t possible. But I can’t blame 
you — exactly — any more than 
I can blame lightning for strik- 
ing my house. I think I was 
wrong. Maybe I’m wrong now. 



But — I don’t know what you 
people do — I’d like to shake 
your hand. Or whatever the hell 
it is you’ve got there. I’ve been 
thinking of you as a perverted 
murderer and a filthy animal, 
but I’ll tell you right now, I’d 
rather work together with you — 
for your base, for peace, for 
whatever we can get together on 
— than with some human beings 
in this room!” 

I didn’t stay to watch the ten- 
der scene that followed. 

I didn’t have to, since the 
cameras and tape recorders that 
the studio people had activated 
for me behind every one-way 
mirror in the room would be 
watching for me. I could only 
hope they had not missed a single 
word or scream, because I didn’t 
think I could do that scene over 
again. 

I opened the door quietly and 
left. And as I was going I caught 
the littlest Connick kid sneaking 
past me, headed for the 3-V set 
in the waiting room, and snaked 
out an arm to stop him. “Stink- 
er!” he hissed. “Rat fink!” 

“You may be right,” I told 
him, “but go back and keep your 
father company. You’re in on 
living history today.” 

“Nuts! I always watch Dr. Zhi- 
vago on Monday nights, and it’s 
on in five minutes and — ” 

“Not tonight it isn’t, son. You 
can hold that against me, too.

We preempted the time for a 
different show entirely.” 

I escorted him back into the 
room, closed the door, picked up 
my coat and left. 

C andace was waiting for me 
with the car. She was driving 
it herself. 

“Will I make the nine-thirty 
flight?” I asked. 

“Sure, Gunner.” She steered 
onto the autotraffic lane, put the 
car on servo and dialed the scat- 
port, then sat back and lit a 
cigarette for each of us. I took 
it and looked morosely out tin- 
window. 

Down below us, on the slow- 
traffic level, we were passing a 
torchlight parade, with floats 
and glee clubs and free beer at 
the major pedestrian intersec- 
tions. I opened the glove com- 
partment and took out field 
glasses, looked through them — 
“Oh, you don’t have to check 
up, Gunner. 1 took care of it. 
They’re all plugging the pro- 
gram.” 

“I see they are.” Not only were 
the marchers carrying streamers 
that advertised our preempt 
show, that was now already be- 
ginning to be on the air, but the 
floats carried projection screens 
and amplifiers. You couldn't 
look anywhere in the procession 
without seeing Knafti, huge and 
hideous in his gold carapace, 



clutching the children and pro- 
tecting them against the attack 
of that monster from another 
planet, me. The studio people 
had done a splendid job of splic- 
ing in no time at all. The whole 
scene was there on camera, as 
real as I had just lived it. 

“Want to listen?” Candace 
fished out and passed me a hy- 
perboloid long-hearer, but I 
didn’t need it. I remembered 
what the voices would be saying. 
There would be Connick de- 
nouncing me. Timmy Brown de- 
nouncing me. The kids denounc- 
ing me, all of them. Colonel 
Peyroles, denouncing me; Com- 
mander Whitling, denouncing 
me; even Knafti — denouncing 
me. All that hate and only one 
target. 

Me. 

“Of course. Junior’ll fire you. 
He’ll have to, Gunner.” 

I said, “I need a vacation any- 
way.” It wouldn’t matter. Soon- 
er or later, when the pressure 
was off, Junior would find a way 
to hire me back. Once the law- 
suits had been settled. Once the 
armistice commission could fin- 
ish its work. Once I could be put 
on the payroll inconspicuously, 
at an inconspicuous job in an 
inconspicuous outpost of the 
firm. With an inconspicuous fu- 
ture. 

We slid over the top of a spi- 
raling ramp and down into the 



Till CHILDREN OF NIOIIl

parking bays of the scatport. “So 
long, honey,” I said, “and Merry 
Christmas to you both.” 

“Oh, Gunner! I wish — ” 

But I knew what she really 
wished and I wouldn’t let her 
finish. I said, “He’s a nice fel- 
low, Whitling. And you know? 
I’m not.” 

I didn’t kiss her good-by. 

The scatjet was ready for 
boarding. I fed my ticket into 
the check-in slot, got the green 
light as the turnstile clicked 
open, entered the plane and took 
a seat on the far side, by the 
window. 

You can win any cause if you 
care to pay the price. All it takes 
is one human sacrifice. 

By the time the scatjet began 
to roar, to quiver and to turn on 
its axis away from the terminal 
I had faced the fact that that 
price once and for all was paid. 



I saw Candace standing there 
on the roof of the loading dock, 
her skirts whipped by the back- 
blast. She didn’t wave to me, but 
she didn’t go away as long as I 
could see her standing on the 
platform. 

Then, of course, she would go 
back to her job and ultimately 
on Christmas morning to that 
nice guy at the nospital. Haber 
would stay in charge of his no- 
longer-important branch office. 
Connick would win his cam- 
paign. Knafti would transact his 
incomprehensible business with 
Earth; and if any of them ever 
thought of me again it would be 
with loathing, anger and con- 
tempt. But that is the way to win 
an election. You have to pay the 
price. It was just the breaks of 
the game that the price of this 
one was me.

Forgotten road to success in writing 



By J. D. Ratcliff 

X can't imagine why more beginners don’t 
take the short road to publication — by 
writing magazine and newspaper articles. 

I’ve made a good living for 25 years 
writing articles, and I’ve enjoyed every 
minute of it. I’ve interviewed Nobel Prize 
winners and heads of state. I’ve covered 
stories from Basel to Bangkok to Buffalo. 

It’s a great life. No commuter trains to 
catch, no office routine. Whether I’m at 
home or abroad on assignment, I write 
from eight to noon every day — no more, 
no less. My afternoons are my own. 

The market for articles is vast and hun- 
gry. Over 350,000 were sold last year to 
magazines alone. Editors want pieces on 
almost any subject that comes natural to 
you — but they demand that your writing 
be sound and professional. 

To teach professional writing techniques 
to serious beginners, I joined with Rod 
Serling, Faith Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, and 
eight other leading authors to start the 
Famous Writers School. 

We poured everything we know about 
successful writing into a new kind of 
course which trains you at home, in spare 
time. You begin with the fundamentals of 
all good writing. Then, you specialize in 
articles and other non-fiction. (Or in Fic- 
tion, Advertising or Business Writing.) 

You learn to write by writing. Our in- 
structors, themselves all published au- 
thors, work with you by mail much as 
editors do with established writers. 

Our School is young. Yet students, many 
still in training, have broken into print in 
more than 60 publications. Several sold 
pieces they wrote as School assignments. 



Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you too can be a published 
writer, send for the School’s revealing Apti- 
tude Test. If you test well — or offer other 
evidence of writing ability — you may enroll. 
However, there is no obligation to do so. 




“Jack” Ratcliff is one of America’s highest paid 
free-lance writers. Although he works only 
four hours a day, he has had hundreds of articles 
published in top magazines, including over 
100 in Reader’s Digest alone.
