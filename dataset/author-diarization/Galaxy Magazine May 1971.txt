LETTERS 3 



Some time ago I suggested in 
this space that human intelli- 
gence, if it existed at all, should in 
the light of current needs be con- 
sidered wealth. All right, I’ve just 
spent three days and far into 
nights in the hall of diamonds. 

With you. 

Bernard Williams, our associate 
publisher, resident cynic and rain- 
maker during dry spells — and one 
of the best friends you and I could 
have — made up the December 
reader poll. Bern is also the au- 
thor of one of the most widely 
published texts (all English- 
speaking countries and ten for- 
eign languages) on psychomet- 
rics, the science of measurement 
of psychophysical processes. 

In a sense both you and I were 
undergoing psychometric testing 
in the poll. You scored brilliantly. 
You came through wide-angle, 
glittering, en masse , and with fine 
detail in the closeups. And you 
shape up like an editor’s dream. 

The response has been great and 
the results uniformly gratify- 
ing. Actually questionnaires 
and letters are still coming in but 
more than enough are on hand to 
give us a definite picture. 

Wide-angle first: more than two- 
thirds of Galaxy's brain trust — you 
folks — are in age from 18 (55% in 
college) to 39. The educational 
level of this group is tops — 74.4% 
college or better. The age groups 
at each end of the spectrum are 



split fairly evenly. The oldest 
reader to send in a questionnaire 
to date is 73 — he extended his sub- 
scription. 

Robert A. Heinlein’s / Will Fear 
No Evil (concluding installment) 
and Robert Silverberg’s We Are 
Well Organized handily won the 
best story in the issue vote by split- 
ting almost exactly 50% of the 
total ballots. James Blish’s Dark- 
side Crossing was a fairly close 
third — Stephen Tail’s The Mad 
Scientist And The FBI , fourth. 

Here are some of your reactions 
to key questions: 

1) I don't like fantasy mixed in 
with science fiction. The trick 
phrasing here was deliberate: a) 
the question was an important 
one; the argument is as old as sf 
and we wanted you to do a double 
take, think it over and answer 
from conviction; b) Bern and I 
had been arguing about this, ham- 
mer and tongs, and the question 
was loaded in case you weren’t 
looking. 

But you were looking and Bern 
was the first to congratulate 
me — 64% of you rephrased the 
statement to: I like ( occasional 
fantasy ... or otherwise left no 
doubt. 

Actually I don’t like to mix most 
fantasy with sf — but I want to be 
able to run a work like Blish’s Day 
After Judgment in Galaxy when 
I have the chance. It doesn’t hap- 
pen daily. 

So thank you. 

2) Nearly 80% of you gave four - 
letter-and-cussword freedom of ex- 
pression to Galaxy — but let me 
pledge you this: I won’t buy them

T HE man from the ministry was 
coming. Today. Tomorrow and 
tomorrow and tomorrow. Or had 
it been yesterday? Yesterday and 
yesterday and yesterday. It was 
summer and a fine morning. 
Afternoon. Yes — afternoon. He 
had had his lunch, so it was after- 
noon. The sun high and the swal- 
lows, sweet sister swallows, dot- 
ERNESTHILL dancing above the trees presaging 

fine days to come. Peter San- 
derson lit his pipe and walked slow- 
ly to the French windows looking 
out to the long, downward slop- 



5 



ing rose garden. His eye followed 
the irregular line t of the bushes 
petering out where the undulating 
bank curved into an even parabola 
ending at the willows, drooping 
over a river’s course in sinusoidal 
loops across the meadows and into 
the woods behind. No. It had not 
been yesterday and yesterday 
and yesterday. The words had not 
been said. The conversation re- 
hearsed only in his own mind. The 
problem had not been resolved. 

The problem — yes. Was it — had 
it indeed been a problem? Here, 
buried in a quiet garden behind a 
smiling Tudor house in a tiny de- 
populated village, the few scat- 
tered buildings of his workshops 
and laboratories — Sanderson’s 
zoo — landscaped and blended in- 
to the countryside, problems of 
any sort became no more than 
academic exercises. Solutions 
were found, theses written, find- 
ings tabulated into typescript, 
folded and placed into large buff 
envelopes and posted away. That 
was the end and solution to all 
problems. Sometimes large, stiff 
envelopes arrived of their own ac- 
cord. Sealed and stamped with 
curious insignia. “Top secret.” 
“Urgent.” “Immediate” “Prior- 
ity.” “Destroy after perusal.” And 
a host of other meaningless titles 
to the trumpery within. You 
scanned them at your leisure, con- 
sidered the requirements, tested, 
experimented and, in your own 



good time, supplied the answers. 
You did not ask yourself what it 
was the little people in the cities 
might do with your findings or 
why they needed the information in 
the first place. At least, he had 
never considered the oddities of 
their demands untilnow. Not until 
the envelope had arrived with more 
seals and stamps than most. 

It had been delivered by hand, 
he remembered. Someone in a 
blue — or had it been a khaki uni- 
form? Dropping onto the garden 
pad in an autogyro. Marching 
with a left-right crunch up the 
chipped crazed paving path and 
snapping his hand up to the peak 
of his cap. He had insisted on see- 
ing the document placed in the 
safe before he left. 

Peter Sanderson opened the 
French windows and smiled 
whimsically as he stepped out to 
the lawn and settled himself in the 
garden chair under the sycamore. 
They had had difficulty in finding 
a safe, he remembered. Had set- 
tled finally for a refrigeration 
cabinet used otherwise for cul- 
tures of some of the more deadly 
plagues. It had seemed safe enough 
even to the much-bemedaled 
comedian with the gold braid. 

He had not considered the man 
particularly odd at the time. The 
city people were always odd. 
Everything had seemed straight- 
forward enough when he had 
found time to open the envelope

and study the requirements. The 
job of any scientist was to supply 
only the overall evaluation. To 
tell them what was and what was 
not possible. To give guidelines 
they would afterward translate in- 
to computer language and feed 
into their production controls. 

Yes , he thought, drav/ing on his 
pipe and letting the smoke curl up 
to where a thrush was trilling on 
an outward-spreading branch. 
From the great , windowless 
dungeons of their cities , from all 
their automated production and 
cybernetics, they have to come 
down to an ordinary man in the 
end to do their thinking for them. 
They can only develop what we, 
detached from it all, give them to 
play with. Neither they nor all their 
machines can invent any new 
thing or even ask themselves an 
objective question. Why are we 
doing it? Is this what we really 
want? Where do we want to get to? 
Is there a better way? 

As long as the scientist sup- 
plied the answers expected of him 
and came up with a regular sup- 
ply of new ideas they would leave 
him in peace in his primitive sur- 
roundings with flowers in his gar- 
dens and the absurdity of windows 
in his walls to look out upon some- 
thing he seemed unaccount- 
ably — and from their point of view, 
perversely — to want to see. A 
scientist should never interfere 
or question their right to a knowl- 



edge that was any man’s for the 
asking if he knew what the ques- 
tions should be. 

The man from the ministry was 
on his way now. A black dot 
among the dipping of the 
swallows, hovering over the trees. 
The pilot was probably checking 
his charts and looking for some 
sort of concrete pad in the absence 
of the usual flat roof to land on. He 
would find himself a spot in the 
end. His jets would scorch a black 
patch in the meadow and the cows 
with their ungainly udders swing- 
ing would amble around, chew and 
stare at him. The man from the 
ministry would be helped from his 
seat. Something thin and black 
would descend the steps, a brief- 
case on one side and an umbrella 
on the other. A gray, amorphous 
shading between the hard brim of 
the hat and the crisp whiteness of 
the collar. A face perhaps. The 
striped trousers and polished shoes 
would pick their way carefully 
through the cowpats and trample 
on the buttercups. The gray-black 
wraith would bend, bow stiffly and 
extend a cuff-white hand, cold and 
moist as the tail of a fish. 

“Heigh-ho!" Peter Sanderson 
sighed. “Better go and meet him, 1 
suppose." 

W HAT a pleasant surprise to 
find the face under the regu- 
lation Homburg hat ruddy, pleas- 
ant and — what was more — vaguely

recognizable. He had met the man 
some time. Either last week or 
twenty-five years ago. A large 
hand outstretched, a firm grip fol- 
lowed by a genial pumping. Hard- 
ly the hand of the minister of — 
what was it — Research and Devel- 
opment? Astronautics? Ergonom- 
ics, ecology and materials supply? 

“Don’t I—?’’ 

“You remember me? Wilfred 
Wannemaker. We were at 'Harwell 
together/’ 

“Were we indeed?” 

The name was remotely familiar, 
the face also. Harwell. What or 
who was Harwell — or what was it 
Harwell had once been? Some sort 
of university. Imperial College of 
Science and Technology. Yes, he 
had been to Harwell. He had 
graduated at Harwell twenty — or 
was it forty? — years ago. What 
had a minister of whatever it was to 
do with Science and Technology? 
Ministers were not technocrats. 
Ministers were not anything that 
he had heard of. 

“Yes — of course we were!” 
Wannemaker seemed excessively 
jovial, he noticed. “I graduated in 
Twenty-one-fifty. You had already 
gone down by then, of course. A 
legend and an inspiration to all of 
us. Honors in everything. My 
goodness, yes! We all knew what 
the future had in store for you. 
And look at you now! Where we 
who were proud to know you were 
all confident you would finish up!” 



Peter Sanderson untied and 
retightened the knot in the necktie 
twisted around the wasitband of 
the tweed trousers that, adjust 
them as he might, always man- 
aged to slip down over his meager 
hips, leaving a bulge behind and a 
frayed turn-up trapped under the 
left shoe heel. 

“Where am I?” he asked 
curiously. 

“Now — come now, Professor!” 
The man who had called himself 
Wannemaker smiled. “You know 
very well where you are. What? 
With all of us in the ministries 
hanging on to your every word? 
You are without doubt the leading 
anthropologist in the world today.” 
“Anthropologist, you say?” 
“Would that not be correct? I 
know of course of your reputa- 
tion as a biologist, endocrinolo- 
gist, ecologist — to name but a 
few — ha-ha — might one say?” 
“Interesting,” he murmured. 
“Very interesting.” 

“Surely you are aware of your 
own reputation?” 

“I am aware of very few things 
that happen in the cities and 
the — shall we say developed areas 
of society? You appear to think 
highly of my work. I am very grati- 
fied. I was not aware that I was so 
well known outside my own quite 
academic circle.” 

“Your contributions to the soci- 
ety you shun are well known, Pro- 
fessor — and appreciated. The 



8 



GALAXY 




tangible results of your theoreti- 
cal studies are probably more far- 
reaching than you imagine. We 
all — in the various lands of the 
West — sleep more soundly in our 
beds in the knowledge that you are 
there.’" 

“Do you indeed?” he reflected. 
“But only in the West? I had hoped 
that all mankind — ” There was a 
blackbird hopping on its yellow 
stilt legs behind the gladiolas. 
Black like the minister and, in the 
limited enclave of the garden; 
considerably more important. 
“Tell me,” he asked suddenly. “I 
recently had a visit from a very ex- 
alted personage in some military 
attire. He seemed moved by the 
desire to salute me at every turn. 
Would that phenomenon have 
been due in some measure to what 
you term — my reputation?” 

“That, Professor, was General 
First Class Alexander Dunweath- 
er. 

“As 1 thought, as I thought. 
Somewhat renowned in his own 
field, no doubt?” 

“But surely, Professor, you 
know. General Dunweather is Su- 
preme Allied Commander, Stra- 
tegic Space and Satellite Forces 
Western Europe.” 

“And he saluted me? Well now, 1 
am more flattered than 1 knew I 
was at the time.” 

“Shall we go inside, Professor? 
We have a lot to discuss concern- 
ing General Dunweather and the 



project on which you have been 
working.” 

“Project? What project? Ah, yes! 
The large, buff envelope with 
many seals and stamps that the 
good general did me the honor of 
delivering personally into my 
own hands. And from there to the 
refrigeration cabinet. Certainly 
we will discuss it. The matter has 
been very much on my mind of 
late. You would like a sherry, no 
doubt?” 

It would, of course be a sherry, 
Wannemaker thought, holding 
the clear crystal glass to the light. 
And served in an antique re- 
ceptacle blown from a heavy and 
preposterously unsuitable medium. 
Probably not a single lightweight 
plastic utensil in the house. 

They live utterly in the past, 
these academic types. Incredible 
how a man can work and even 
think with the distraction of the 
daylight and the outside world 
streaming in through glass holes in 
the walls. Sitting, even, under a 
tree with the damp, unconditioned 
wind blowing through his unpro- 
tected, natural hair. Myself, I 
should die of rheumatism at an 
early age and, lacking the society 
and competition of my fellows, / 
should achieve nothing at all. 
Boredom would stultify my every 
effort. A nd yet perhaps . 

“I envy you, Professor. 

“My dear fellow! You gradu- 
ated, you tell me. You, too, could 



TIPOFTHE ICEBERG

have chosen the academic life. All 
of us seem to have slipped away to 
our various little hidey-holes. There 
are plenty more if you look for 
them. Population seems, I have no- 
ticed, to be dwindling fast." 

“I am afraid the city called me. 
Politics. A sense of service to my 
fellows, you might say. I devel- 
oped early on, I suppose, those 
qualities of leadership — I set out 
on a search for — " 

“Power?" the professor asked, 
mildly. 

“Yes," he said. “Yes. I suppose 
you could call it that. Power. I 
achieved it, you know. I have 
power now in a certain measure. 

“My congratulations." 

“You are somewhat contemp- 
tuous, Professor. But you, too, 
whether you like it or not, have 
power. Considerably more than 1 
have or could hope to attain." 

“You are about to explain to me 
a pronouncement I can only at this 
moment regard as cryptic." 

“Yes," Wannemaker agreed. He 
emptied his glass, got up and 
walked to the large brick fireplace, 
smoke-grimed and so authentic- 
looking it was impossible not to 
imagine that it was sometimes, in 
winter, put to its original use. An 
inadequate incinerator and an 
ineffectual radiator and con- 
vector of heat. He found the 
hearth, however, a suitable plat- 
form and, leaning on the mantel, 
looked down curiously at the 



slight, ill-clad figure comfortably 
buried in the floral tapestry of a 
deep-cushioned armchair. 

ttpROFESSOR SANDER- 
r SON," he said. “I, with 
some scientific training, have done 
my best to fathom your report on 
the Dunweather project. I confess 
I am at a loss. You have apparent- 
ly, in excess of our most optimistic 
forecasts, achieved a breakthrough. 
And yet you have seen fit to pre- 
sent your findings in terms of — 
shall we say, a philosophical trea- 
tise? If we interpret you correctly 
you are unwilling to supply details 
of your experiments because of 
your misgivings about some ulti- 
mate but unnamed harm that 
might befall the human race as a 
result of the wider applications of 
your technique. Do I read you 
correctly?" 

Peter Sanderson rummaged in 
his bulging pockets for his tobacco 
pouch and matches. He filled his 
pipe carefully and lit it to his sat- 
isfaction before replying. 

“You do," he said. 

“I need hardly tell you, Profes- 
sor, that for an academic to imag- 
ine himself capable of deciding on 
the utilitarian aspect of his theo- 
ries is, in a modern industrialized 
society, is — well — is" 
“Unthinkable?" 

“You must see. Professor — " 
“But 1 do see, Mr. — er — your 
name is Wannemaker, I believe? 



10 



GALAXY 




Yes, I do see. But you mentioned 
power, Mr. Wannemaker. I have 
never wished for positive power — 
the sort of authority I do not doubt 
you exercise. I am quite content to 
leave the decision inherent in run- 
ning a conglomerate society to the 
heads of that society. But you are 
quite right. I do have this power in 
a negative sense. I am in a position 
to give you what you require but 1 
do not intend to do so. That is what 
one might term the negative 
aspect of my authority.” 

Wannemaker drew himself to his 
full and considerable height. He 
was tall and, in the eyes of his col- 
leagues on committee, a dis- 
tinguished figure. When he spoke 
good committee men fell into a 
respectful silence, nodding like 
teazles in the warm winds of his 
eloquence. But now, meeting the 
bright, smiling eyes of the small 
figure in the chair, he hesitated, 
uncertain whether to threaten 
with a quick cut-off of funds or 
cajole with an emphasis on every 
man’s duty to the state. 

“Yes?” Peter Sanderson asked, 
mildly. 

“Professor — ” 

“Yes?” 

“You are aware, are you not, of 
the reasons behind General Dun- 
weather’s concern? We have intel- 
ligence that the Russians, who have 
been experimenting with this form 
of communication for some 
years, have achieved a break- 



through. From ground station to 
distant starship, we are told. We 
don’t know its extent, or how ef- 
fective it will prove, but it has be- 
come obvious that such a possibil- 
ity exists.” 

“And we should not be left be- 
hind?” 

“Certainly we should not.” 

“No,” he said. “I see that.” 

He sucked at his pipe for a while 
and a tabby cat, padding in from 
the garden, jumped silently onto 
his lap, curled up and went to sleep. 
He continued to sit staring through 
the windows, seeing in his mind’s 
eye, although Wannemaker was 
not aware of it, the upsurge of a 
mushroom cloud that had bur- 
geoned for the same reasons in the 
necessity to forestall its develop- 
ment by the wrong side. But the 
mushroom was history and would 
have been there in the end what- 
ever any man had done. Knowl- 
edge is like that. It is any man’s for 
the asking. Suddenly he knocked 
out his pipe and stuffed it back into 
his trousers pocket. Removing 
the cat, he got to his feet. 

“Come,” he said. “You have not 
understood the philosophical — as 
you call them — reasons for my re- 
fusal to proceed any further with 
telepathic methods of contact. I 
will give you a practical demon- 
stration.”

through a heavy, iron-studded 
door. So quickly did he move that 
the minister, with by far the longer 
pair of legs, had difficulty in keep- 
ing up with him on the graveled 
drive that led to a sparse colony of 
scattered outbuildings among the 
trees. 

“What do you suppose was my 
first experiment?" He threw the 
words over his shoulder while the 
rocks wheeling above the elm trees 
gossiped and squawked among 
themselves. 

“I’ve naturally no idea." 

The professor stopped in his 
tracks, turned to face him. 

“You don’t?" he asked. 

“No." 

“Do you know /what race 
claimed telepathic contact among 
its priesthood, along with tele- 
kinesis and bilocation?" 

“No— I don’t." 

The rooks, disturbed by the first 
crunching steps on the gravel, 
swooped and cawed among the 
trees and a frog from the depths of 
a ditch croaked with a guttural 
guffaw. The professor turned on 
his heel and set off nimbly toward 
the first of the huts. 

“The Tibetans," he threw back 
to the minister. “They drove a 
spike of wood into the brains of 
their initiates. Through the fore- 
head. Once you knew how big a 
spike and where to put it, it was 
supposed to give them telepathic 
ability." 



“And did it?" 

“That is what I set out to dis- 
cover. On rats at first. I experi- 
mented with pegs and rats. Two 
thousand of them. I put them 
through a series of carefully con- 
trolled experiments. Food hidden 
where one rat knew its location 
but the subject rat did not. And 
more of this nature. In the end I 
succeeded. I discovered the exact 
size of the peg and the point where 
to insert it through the skull. I 
progressed as far as the Tibetan 
Llamas had done a thousand years 
ago. I created a telepathic rat." 

“And then?" Wannemaker was 
struggling to keep up with the hur- 
rying figure. Annoyed at this un- 
orthodox method of reporting and 
considerably concerned for the se- 
curity aspect. A Russian agent, for 
all the scurrying figure knew, 
might be lurking with tape- 
recorder and short-wave transmit- 
ter behind every buckthorn bush. 

“Then, naturally, I continued 
with relatively sized pegs on a num- 
ber of higher animals, fishes and 
birds. I Induced telepathic abilities 
in all my subjects. Finally I carried 
out the crucial test. On a primate. 
The gentleman we are about to 
visit. An adult male gorilla." 

“But my dear professor — why a 
gorilla?" 

Peter Sanderson unfastened the 
latch on a five-barred gate across a 
concrete path leading to a large, 
brick-built hut with flower beds uri-

der the barred windows and 
wisteria trailing around the door. 

“You mean why not a chimp or 
a gibbon? I happened to have a go- 
rilla for which 1 had no other use. 
A rather likeable animal. We call 
him Rastus." 

The door to the hut was opened 
by a white-coated young man, also 
with a pipe in his mouth and a rose 
in his buttonhole. 

“Come in," the professor in- 
vited. “I want you to see Rastus’s 
rather remarkable accomplish- 
ments." 

Wannemaker found himself in a 
narrow passage, facing a line of 
cages. In the first of these a 
heavily built gorilla was standing, 
holding on to the bars with both 
hands and, in a very disconcerting 
fashion, staring him in the eyes. 
Something about the face moved 
Wannemaker intensely. A sense of 
brutish, seemingly demonic power. 
The bloodshot whites of the deep- 
set, brooding eyes; the half-open 
mouth exposing strong, yellow 
teeth; the massive, overhanging, 
intelligent brows. There was some- 
thing malignant in the steady and, 
to Wannemaker’s mind, totally 
evil stare. Even as he blinked, 
uncertain and incredulous, Rastus 
tugged suddenly at the bars and 
jumped back against the wall with 
a sharp cry of revulsion. 

“It’s all right,” Sanderson said 
sharply. “He can’t get his arms 
through the bars. Come along to

SPEAKING of being a Very Big Cor- 
poration— we were, last month— 
(speaking of it, that is), there are lots 
of traps in becoming a large corpo- 
rate structure. Immobility is one. 
There seems to be a direct correla- 
tion between number of people and 
the ability to move. We are trying to 
offset this by doing our publishing in 
separate pockets, as it were— hence 
Beagle, Walden, Comstock and the 
new London operation. Ballantine 
Books 7 far-flung Empire. All of which 
make it possible for the original BB's 
to nip off to places like San Francisco 
for a couple of days or to get Annie 
over here for a week (well, hell, how 
else would we have gotten the galleys 
of DRAGONQUEST read in time?) 
and for others to visit us from vari- 
ous points of our small globe. In this 
way we hope to evade yet another 
problem of bigness— lack of commun- 
ication.

AS TO what happens within our of- 
fices of (now) Vk floors, it's a bloody 
mad house. We conducted a small 
poll recently and found that not one 
of the 90-odd bodies now located here 
would want it any other way. Work- 
ing in this firm does something to peo- 
ple. As an example of our esprit-de- 
corps (if that is, indeed, what it can 
be called) the entire Accounting De-

partment is flowering forth in beards. 
Formidable. A lot of us even read our 
own books— outside of the editors, 
that is. (This is a rare thing in a pub- 
lishing house.) This department must 
sadly admit to not being able to keep 
up with the whole list any more. Just 
the Adult Fantasy, Science Fiction, 
Mysteries, Westerns, Ecology, En- 
vironment, Comstock and sex books. 
Enough. 



HAVING thus brought you adroitly 
to the discussion of books, what have 
we got for this month— a whole fleet 
of books from Fred Pohl and Jack 
Williamson, namely: UNDERSEA 
QUEST, UNDERSEA FLEET, and 
UNDERSEA CITY— three to do with 
subsea acadehny types (did you see 
that crazy Cousteau film on the sea- 
dragons of Galapagos?) involved in 
various adventures, plus another 
group of Clark Ashton Smith stories 
-HYPERBOREA— our Adult Fan- 
tasy. Meanwhile all the H.P. Love- 
craft titles in Ballantine and Beagle 
go bouncing from glory to glory. 
Great stuff.

the next cage. Now — as you will 
notice — Rastus can’t see or hear us 
in here. There’s a thick wall and a 
close-fitting connecting door be- 
tween us. Here, take a banana and 
hide it in one of those cupboards.” 

The professor, Wannemaker 
noted, was a man different in his 
laboratory from the easy-going 
savant in the house. He was quick- 
spoken, keyed-up, exact in all he 
did. Wannemaker noticed the cup- 
boards, numbered one to twenty- 
four against the far wall. Opening 
one, he put the banana inside, 
closing and locking the door and, 
at Sanderson’s direction, hiding 
the key under some straw on the 
floor. 

“All right,” Sanderson said. 
“Come outside and watch Rastus 
carefully.” 

He closed and secured the cage 
door behind them. Then both he 
and the young assistant heaved on 
a rope running over a pulley to the 
connecting door until it was fully 
open. Rastus stood still, his hands 
on the cage bars, watching the door 
rise until it was secured and the 
rope tied. Then Wannemaker was 
conscious of the blood-red eyes on 
his face, unblinking, unwavering 
and, he was convinced, charged 
with an indescribable malevolent 
hatred. The lips pulled back in a 
grin — a snarl it may have 
been — and the beast turned, sham- 
bled through the door, picked up 
the key from under the straw, un-

locked the correct cupboard, took 
out the banana, peeled it and, 
squatting on his haunches, pop- 
ped it into his mouth. His eyes were 
still on Wannemaker as he 
sucked his fingers, nibbling re- 
flectively at the nails. 

“He read your mind,” Sander- 
son said simply. “Or mine — or 
Roger's here— or the minds of all 
three of us together. It's not 
words, of course, that tell him 
where to go. It is the visual sense 
we all have before we verbalize 
that transfers itself. The gestalt, 
one might say. But we haven’t fin- 
ished. Roger, give him the bag of 
tricks.” 

R OGER took down a canvas 
bag from a hook on the wall 
and passed it through a one-way 
flap set in the bars of the cage. He 
produced a second banana and 
laid it in the passageway a few 
feet from the grille. 

“Now then — we’ll let you con- 
duct the next operation yourself. 
Inside that bag are a dozen or so 
rods. Any three of them will screw 
together to make a scoop nearly 
but not quite long enough for Ras- 
tus to reach his banana. They’re all 
numbered — one to fifteen, to be 
exact. Now-take a piece of paper 
and write down any three numbers 
you would like Rastus to use and 
let him do the rest. Until you give 
him the idea he won’t even be able 
to open the bag.” 



Rastus was looking at him again 
as he took out his notebook and 
pencil. He knew it was foolish to 
assume that the grin of any simian 
had the same origin as a human’s 
desire to laugh, but there was, he 
was convinced, something more 
than anthropomorphism in his 
own conviction that Rastus was 
smirking at him with a sardonic 
and vindictive contempt. Even 
before he finished writing Rastus 
had lurched away to the bag, 
opened it and, taking out the cor- 
rect three rods, had begun clum- 
sily but without hesitation screw- 
ing them together. 

“Remarkable — ” Wannemaker 
breathed. 

“Wait,” The professor whis- 
pered. “You haven’t seen anything 
yet.” 

Rastus inserted the rod between 
the bars and reached toward the 
banana, which remained another 
eighteen inches beyond his grasp. 
For a moment he seemed frus- 
trated and uneasy. His eyes strayed 
toward Wannemaker’s but he 
obviously found no comfort 
there. He shook his head several 
times and scratched his forehead 
with his free hand. Then he laid 
down the rod and stood for a while, 
grasping the bars, his head bent 
forward and his eyes closed. The 
banana began to move. A flick at a 
time, a quiver, a short bounce and 
then, rocking and slewing like a 
Mexican jumping bean, it began 



TIPOFTHE ICEBERG

to move toward the cage. In a half- 
minute it was within reach of the 
rod, was hooked and maneuvered 
back to a point where the long 
fingers could reach out, secure it 
and draw it inside to be peeled and 
eaten. 

The professor nodded, well 
pleased. 

"Three factors emerge from this 
experiment," he explained. “Each 
in its own way remarkable. 
First — there is a sense of number, 
which was also hinted at in the cup- 
board experiment. All the rods 
would have fitted together had you 
been aware of it and made an 
instrument long enough for the 
purpose. But you did not know 
that and he was at that time taking 
his instructions from you alone. 
Roger and I kept our own minds 
inoperative by mentally counts 
ing from fifteen upward. But far 
more important than the sense of 
number was the ability to rec- 
ognize numerals, a totally dif- 
ferent matter. He could not, of 
course, relate the symbol for 
eight with any specific quantity 
but he received the image and 
identified its counterpart on the 
rod, together with the other two 
numerals you gave him. Children 
do much the same thing when, in- 
correctly, they are taught their 
tables before they have had time 
to develop a sense of plurality. 
Thirdly, and totally unrelated to 
the phenomenon of image recep- 



tion, he has demonstrated the fact 
of telekinesis. The paraphysical 
powers latent in any brain are at 
this creature's command once he 
learns how to use them." 

II 

T HEY were back in the comfort- 
able lounge of the Tudor house, 
drinking tea and munching dry 
pastry the professor referred to 
as “biscuits" before Sanderson 
would discuss the matter further 
or answer the question that was 
uppermost in Wannemaker’s 
mind. Night was deepening over 
the willows and Wannemaker 
had already settled himself to 
stay the night in an unheated and 
overventilated bedroom when 
the professor suddenly set down 
his teacup and produced a bottle 
of scotch. As he uncorked the 
bottle he returned without fur- 
ther preamble to the subject of his 
report. 

“You want to know why, having 
progressed so far, I do not intend 
to go any further?" He handed his 
guest a glass and raised his own, 
staring at it thoughtfully for a 
while before he drank. 

“There is an overall philosophi- 
cal concept I shall try to explain to 
you later. A matter, shall we say, 
of the use of knowledge and the 
relationship of man to his destiny. 
The tiny, three-dimensional world 
of man and all his cousins is the tip

GALAXY 




only of a larger, paraterrestrial 
iceberg. But all this can wait. Let 
us consider Rastus himself. You 
have seen the ability this poor crea- 
ture has developed as the result of 
a crude experiment: to read your 
thoughts and to utilize a power, the 
source of which no one, myself in- 
cluded, can explain. And Rastus is 
learning fast. Already we have 
taken elaborate precautions to 
ensure his safety. It is not bananas 
he wants most in life. It is free- 
dom. The key to the door of his 
cell.” 

“But surely, he can’t — ” Wan- 
nemaker began. 

“You have seen what Rastus can 
receive. You have not seen, nor do 
we know, what he can project. 
Telepathy is a two-way com- 
munication and its field, as far as 
we know, is not limited by dis- 
tance. Hence your general’s inter- 
est in its application in space. Not 
only can Rastus read your mind, he 
can also transmit his thoughts to 
you. We are not at all sure what 
form these thoughts may take since 
they cannot, of course, be formu- 
lated in words or even, possibly, in 
readily understandable concepts. 
But I am not at all sure that it was 
not Rastus himself who decided 
that you would stay the night with 
me. It was an out-of-character de- 
cision on your part and he seems, 
Mr. Wannemaker, to have taken a 
strong dislike to you.” 

Wannemaker wriggled uncom- 



fortably in his chair. It was too 
deep and too low and he was a man 
much given to the right postures. 
He had not followed everything 
the professor had intended to 
convey but Rastus’s dislike of 
him had seemed patent enough. 
He was not at all sure that Sander- 
son was not ranging himself on 
the side of his monkey. 

“True, I sensed a certain malev- 
olence every time he looked at me. 
But surely it’s ridiculous to sug- 
gest — Why, I decided quite freely 
myself to accept your — ah — excel- 
lent hospitality.” 

Sanderson refilled the glasses 
and drew the curtains against the 
darkening night. A clock chimed 
from the hallway. 

“Malevolence is not the word,” 
he said. “No, no. Neither Rastus 
nor any beast can be malevolent, in 
the way you mean. He can project 
only the images of his own sub- 
jective life. Brutish to you, no 
doubt. Probably more brutish still 
due to his unnatural life in a cage 
far from the society of his fellows 
and the forests of his home. He 
has not so far seen fit to convey his 
images to me.” 

“But you know that he could. 
You believed he had done so to 
me. 

“I have a colleague, Mr. Wan- 
nemaker. A young lady. She is an 
excellent zoologist, a quiet, pale, 
rather withdrawn girl not given to 
emotional upsets. She is now at 



TIPOFTHE ICEBERG 



17 




home under sedation very near to a 
serious mental breakdown. Rastus 
desired her, Mr. Wannemaker. He 
has no mate of his own and no 
means, one would think, of formu- 
lating, let alone projecting, his 
confused desires. Yet he desires 
her. This confused projection of 
longing burgeoned the first time 
he saw her after the insertion of 
our peg in his brain. He continues 
to desire her from a quite con- 
siderable distance. Her house is 
ten miles away, but I am afraid 
that Dr. Angela Styles is never 
without Rastus in her mind or 
without an awareness of his pres- 
ence. He will remain with her until 
he dies. Even after he dies, I am not 
sure — ” 

"You don’t say!” 

Wannemaker stared at him. The 
lighting in the small room with its 
ridiculously low, beamed ceiling 
was far from adequate. Two small 
standard lamps with incongruous- 
ly large and only vaguely translu- 
cent shades. The atmosphere was 
eerie. The quiet, unemotional voice 
of the professor, the creaking of 
the uneven floor, a spasmodic 
thudding, due possibly to a tree 
branch stirred by the night wind 
and striking against the wall of the 
house. Still more eerie in the 
uneasy silences when nothing hap- 
pened at all. It seemed not impos- 
sible in this otherworldly house to 
sense the thought patterns of 
Rastus like radio waves streaming 



in, permeating the half-light, 
curling with the smoke patterns 
from the professor’s pipe, eddy- 
ing in fragile images, trailing off 
into the air, but remaining after- 
ward, a dead static conception of 
presence like the stale smell of 
tobacco after the pipe has gone 
out. 

"I do say,” the professor puffed, 
in answer to his question. 

"But,” Wannemaker objected, 
pulling himself together with an 
effort. "If that is so and your go- 
rilla can project something toward 
the lady, something evil — ” 

"Not evil,” Sanderson inter- 
rupted sharply. "He is projecting 
no more than a natural response, 
not even, as far as we know, any 
suggestion of actual mating. Do 
you think Rastus believes this to be 
evil? Evil implies departure from 
an accepted standard.” 

"Very well — not evil, but shall 
we say — unfortunate? If you are 
now satisfied that the same opera- 
tion is possible on a human being, 
what is the further objection to do- 
ing it? If Rastus is destroyed and 
the project is carried to its logical 
conclusion the juxtaposition of 
the bestial to the human mind 
would no longer apply.” 

"You still don’t see.” Sander- 
son sighed. "Don’t you realize at 
all what it is I have established? 
That we have now, all of us, to start 
our basic thinking again from 
scratch? That the whole scientific 



18 



GALAXY 




world will now have to rethink 
from its basic theories the whole 
application of knowledge itself? 
We must begin from a new and 
this time quite indisputable 
axiom.” 

“And that is?” 

t'AJV ^ DEAR Wannemaker, for 
an ex-Harwell man, you are 
remarkably unreceptive. What 1 
have established is the simple fact 
that neither the human brain, nor, 
it seems, any brain at all, has 
evolved. There is no evolution. We 
were created.” 

“But how can you possibly de- 
duce — ” 

“Very simply, my dear Min- 
ister. If the brain has evolved, it has 
done so by trial, error, experiment 
and mutation, developing new 
skills to overcome the problems 
with which each succeeding species 
was faced. It would have learned, 
step by step, to manipulate its 
environment. It did not learn to 
develop a paraphysical ability until 
I drove a wedge into its tissues and 
upset the normal workings of its 
highly complex, but still basically 
material, composition. I released 
something apparently new — a 
force. But this force was there al- 
ready. I did not create it. I have un- 
sheathed a link, it seems — a link in- 
herently beyond the organic — to 
the submarine section of the 
human iceberg. This force did not 
evolve, but was inherent and must 



thus, without question, have been 
created.” 

“You mean — by God?” 

“God is a simplification em- 
bracing, as the word does, in one 
concept a hoped-for explanation of 
all we don’t understand. I would go 
no further than an intuitive guess. 
This paraphysical force is a link 
between the brain and the brain 
behind the brain. The mind, if you 
like — the real person, the real 
gorilla, the real rat, of which the 
manishness, the apishness, the 

rattishness is all we can see or 

-1 

understand. It would seem fur- 
ther that all parapersonalities — 
men, apes, rats, possibly all living 
things — are linked by an overall 
mind conception and what we term 
preverbal thought can flow through 
all and perhaps is, in some way in 
totality, common to all.” 

“What a stupendous thought,” 
Wannemaker began. “But I still 
don’t see — ” 

He was interrupted by the clan- 
gor of a telephone bell in an an- 
cient black instrument on the 
carved oak sideboard. The profes- 
sor lifted the receiver and listened 
impassively for a moment. 

“Right,” he said in reply to 
someone. “Get everyone here. I’ll 
notify the police, of course.” He re- 
placed the receiver and looked long 
and sadly at the minister. 

“You don’t see?” he asked, re- 
turned to the original conversa- 
tion. “I think you will see very

shortly. Rastus has escaped/’ 

They heard the story from the 
young man, Rogers, as he drove 
them — Sanderson, Wannemaker, 
a police sergeant and two con- 
stables — at high speed down a re- 
markably ill-surfaced road that led 
to a rambling and isolated house 
where the lady zoologist, Angela 
Styles, lived alone, attended now, 
the professor explained, by a 
nurse and two men from the labs. 
The armed attendant, whose job it 
was to keep an eye on the cage and 
report any suspicious behavior on 
the part of the occupant had 
gotten up, laid down his rifle, un- 
locked the door and let Rastus out, 
without afterward having any 
idea of why he had done so. 

“You see what we’re up 
against?” The professor sighed as 
they turned into a long, tree-lined 
drive. “The same thing could hap- 
pen to any of us. We just don’t 
know what we might do or exactly 
what Rastus can make us do. He 
can’t verbalize. He can have only a 
vague notion of the world outside 
the lab. He cannot make us do 
anything outside the compass of 
his own understanding, but he can 
certainly be moved by a desire to 
prevent his own recapture.” 

“My men have instructions to 
shoot at sight,” the sergeant grunt- 
ed. “Nothing your ape can do will 
stop that.” 

“I regret the necessity, but it is 
the only way. I regret it for the 

20 



sake of Rastus, for the sake of 
learning, for all our sakes. Most of 
all 1 regret the ancient law of all 
creation that we must kill what we 
do not understand. But law it is. 
Society must be protected. If we do 
not kill Rastus, Rastus may kill 
us. 

“We’ll take care of society,” the 
sergeant confirmed. “We have 
every available man out tonight. 
He won’t get far.” 

“You think he will make straight 
for Miss — ah — Doctor Styles?” 

“1 think it more than probable. 
If only because it is the only loca- 
tion he is aware of.” 

A NGELA STYLES was a pale, 
fair-haired girl with thin sharp 
features and small, deep-set but ex- 
ceptionally bright blue eyes. She 
came into the library where they 
had been ushered by the nurse, a 
large room with bookshelves from 
floor to ceiling and high mullioned 
windows looking out onto the 
black shapes of ancient trees 
against the brightness of the moon- 
lit sky. 

“Won’t you sit down?” she said. 
She had, Wannemaker noticed, a 
nervous, reedy voice, but she 
seemed at the same time, although 
taut and very upright in her close- 
fitting housecoat, reasonably 
well composed. 

“So Rastus has escaped?” 

“I’m afraid so,” Sanderson con 
fessed. 



GALAXY 




She sat in a high-backed chair, 
her hands folded in her lap and 
studied them all from sharp, dart- 
ing eyes. There was a long and em- 
barrassed silence before she spoke 
again. 

“You think he will come here, 
Professor?” 

“It is a possibility we can hardly 
overlook.” 

“Now, there’s nothing to worry 
about,” the police sergeant as- 
sured her. “We’ve got a dozen 
armed men in the grounds and the 
professor thinks we all should stay 
the night with you, so you’ll be 
properly looked after. We will 
have the dogs out after him in the 
morning as soon as it’s daylight 
and a squadron of autogyros 
from HQ. He won’t get far, I 
promise you.” 

“And when you find him what 
will you do — shoot him?” 

“If you’ve got a better sugges- 
tion, miss — ” 

She was staring at the professor, 
accusingly Wannemaker thought, 
but he met her eyes squarely and 
shook his head. 

“What else, Doctor Styles?” 

“I see,” she said sharply. She got 
up and straightened the folds of her 
housecoat. Her eyes flickered 
again around the room, resting for 
some time and to his embarrass- 
ment on Wannemaker. She 
seemed, he thought, like a trapped 
bird with the cage door open, un- 
sure if she knew how to fly. 



“Very well. As I seem to be ad- 
equately protected, I shall go to 
bed. Miss Rawlins here will see 
that you are all comfortable. I 
suggest, Professor, that you take 
the room next to mine. I should 
like to know where you are in case 
of necessity.” 

The professor stood for a long 
time at the window of his bed- 
room, looking out at the stars and 
the depth of the blue-black sky and 
the infinity and eternity that was 
beyond the sky. Tall trees on a 
clustered knoll moved only occa- 
sionally in the wind and a single 
long streak of a stratus cloud 
reached out frorn the world’s edge 
across the horizon like the hand of 
God shading his otherworldly 
eyes to see what was on the dark 
side of his personally favored ball 
of rock, floating on the outskirts 
of his otherwise happily inani- 
mate galactic garden. 

Vve made Rastus more and less 
than a man, he said to himself. 
Knowing nothing of his brain or 
the mind behind it, I have split the 
wall and let the mind come oozing 
through. I have broken into the 
garden of all the angels, not be- 
cause I had found the key to the 
door, but suddenly, like a thief 
with a jimmy. I am no better than 
a Mongol at the gates of Samark - 
hand. 

I should like to pray , he thought. 
Not because God and all his angels 
were really there in the garden or 



TIPOFTHE ICEBERG 



21 




could hear him if they were. But 
because he now knew that some- 
thing or someone was there. Be- 
cause of th6 iceberg below the tip. 
Because of himself and the 
knowledge now of someone be- 
hind himself, the counterpart that 
Rastus had found linking him with 
all the other Rastus’s in some great 
shadow-casting sphere beyond 
the umbral and penumbral illu- 
sion of a subjective earth. He let 
himself down on thin and shaking 
knees by the bedside and con- 
sidered what he should say and to 
whom he should say it. They were 
all there somewhere, from Lilith 
to the Mother of God. Lahamu and 
Tiamet. Buddha, Ghengis Khan, 
Jesus of Nazareth and Isaac New- 
ton. One for the master and one for 
the maid and one for the little boy 
who lived down the lane. What 
should he say and whom should he 
choose? Why did reverence de- 
mand genuflexion rather than a 
leap into the everlasting arms, a 
wave and a whistle and a: “Hiya, 
God!” Why words at all? Why 
images? Thou shalt make thyself 
no graven image in thy mind, 
squatting Buddhalike on the 
battlements of a dream. Thou 
shalt not bandy words with God. 
But thou shalt do something 
rather than kneel on rheumy knees 
and let thy thoughts dance nimbly, 
heel for heel and toe for toe, across 
the coverlet. 

Neither words nor images for- 



mulated into anything God might 
want to hear as he knelt by the bed- 
side, hands cupped, staring at the 
wall. There was nothing to say, to 
project across the Great Divide 
into a listening, attentive ear. 
Nothing that the Divided Great 
could understand. An old man’s 
wheezing whisper. A wedge driv- 
en into the skull and tissue of a 
near-human brain. The exped- 
iency of a gorilla’s death. 

Ill 

T here was a sound from the 
next room and his thoughts re- 
turned sharply from their un- 
rewarding amble into wordless 
reverie. A window had opened 
with a stiff, scraping sound. A 
- creaking of loose floorboards, a 
shuffling, a cough and then an un- 
mistakable grunt. He pulled him- 
self to his feet as fast as his stiff 
knees would allow. He felt no fear 
for himself but he was trembling 
nevertheless, almost paralyzed 
by the horrible realization that, 
loud as the sounds had been, 
Angela Styles had not cried out. 
Rastus was there — in Angela 
Styles’ room — and she was com- 
pletely in his power. He dragged 
himself tottering along the pas- 
sage and threw himself against the 
doctor’s door, expecting to find it 
bolted against any entry. It 
opened easily and he found him- 
self lurching into the room head-

first and stumbling toward a black 
shape that was launching itself 
from the open window into the 
night. He staggered after it and 
looked out. There was a tree with 
thick foliage spreading to the 
eaves and a branch was swaying 
with a spasmodic jerky motion. A 
rustle of leaves and then all was 
still. Only then did he turn to the 
bed. Angela Styles was leaning 
back against the pillows, smiling 
and apparently unharmed. 

“You didn’t call for me!” 

“No,” she said quietly. 

“You’re not hurt? He didn't 
touch you?” 

“No. He didn’t touch me.” 

She laughed a short rasping 
laugh and he turned quickly to- 
wards the door. 

“No!” she ordered sharply. 

“But my dear Doctor — ” 

“Call me Angela.” 

“Why — yes— of course, Angela. 
But we can’t just let him run loose. 
No one can predict what he might 
do.” 

“Do you mind if 1 call you 
Peter?” 

“Why, no,” he agreed, puzzled. 
“Call me what you like.” 

“That’s better,” she said enig- 
matically. “You and me, Peter, we 
can’t hand our work over to the 
barbarians. Let Rastus have his 
chance.” 

“I know what you mean. But we 
can’t, Doctor — Angela. Whatever 
we say, we are a part of society.” 



“So is Rastus,” she said. 

He came and sat in the chair by 
her bed and looked at her thought- 
fully. Leaning over, he took her 
pulse. 

“It’s all right,” she smiled. “I’m 
not under his influence, if that’s 
what you are thinking — not in any 
hypnotic way at least. I just don’t 
want anyone to harm him.” 

“You may not know whether 
you are under his influence or not. 
How did he get in? Through the 
window?” 

“Originally,” she said in a tired 
voice. “But he was here all along. 
When you came. He can travel 
very fast, you see. He was hiding 
under my bed.” 

“What!” 

“You needn’t be alarmed. I said 
he was quite harmless. I was afraid 
of him only when I didn’t under- 
stand what he wanted. When he 
came to me I knew. He was fright- 
ened and very lonely. All he 
wanted was to be near and tell me 
how lonely he was — when he found 
out how to do it. I understand 
him, you see.” 

The professor sat staring out 
through the window, helplessly, 
into the night. Torches were flash- 
ing under the trees and a dog was 
barking at the end of the garden. 

“My God,” he said, vocalizing 
the initial capital. “What have we 
done?” 

“I can see you believe me. Pro- 
fessor.”

“Yes,” he said, wearily. “1 be- 
lieve you.” 

“We must get him back safely to 
the lab and remove the wedge.” 

“It’s no use,” he told her. “The 
damage is done. Removed or not, it 
will make no difference.” 

“So this creature has to wander 
Earth, conscious for the first time 
of his own identity, aware of his 
loneliness, unable to use the knowl- 
edge we have thrust upon him, un- 
til he dies.” 

“Until he dies,” he said. 

“Why doesn't he hate us?” she 
asked. “He isn't capable of hate, 
somehow. Is hate only a human 
trait? We haven't made him 
human, we’ve raised him to a level 
we all should have known was 
there, though we never found it. 
We are the brutes, the guilty ones. 
And now, because we are afraid of 
what we've done, we’re going to 
kill him.” 

T HE torches were coming back 
toward the house and the first 
flush of morning was brushing its 
way lightly, orchid-tinting the 
edges of the broadening stratus 
cloud. He stood up and went slowly 
to the door. 

“Yes,” he said. “We’ve called 
out all the forces of law and order. 
Even the minister is here. Nothing 
I say will make any difference now; 
I am a part of that world down 
there, however much I believed 
myself not to be. We have the law 



on our side, whatever we do. And 
right. And the Common Weal. 
But justice? Justice is another 
matter. If we have let in anything 
through the pin-prick in that 
animal’s brain, we may find that 
there is universal justice on the 
other side. And if there is, God help 
us all.” 

He went down to the library 
where the minister was sitting, 
dozing in a leather-upholstered 
chair. The sergeant and the three 
constables were playing gin 
rummy on a mahogany table, their 
rifles ready at their sides. He stood 
at the door, hesitating and uncer- 
tain of what to say. 

“No sign of him yet, Professor. 
The dog-handler thought he had 
something just now but it came to 
nothing. Move through the trees, 
he would, I reckon.” 

“Sergeant,” he said. “I want you 
to call your men off for a while. I 
want to go out myself alone and 
try to make contact with him.” 

“Bit risky that, sir, isn’t it?” 
“No!” Wannemaker sat up and 
dusted his lapels. “I can’t allow 
that for a moment, Professor. You 
are far too valuable to society — to 
your country — to put yourself un- 
necessarily at risk.” 

“I am?” he asked. 

“You must see that yourself. 
This animal is of no further use to 
us. You have developed the techni- 
que. It must be clear to you that, 
loose, he could do untold damage

not only to you but to anyone else 
who crossed his path. Unpleasant 
as it is for all of us, he must be shot 
at sight. 1 ' 

“I don’t take orders, Mr. Wan- 
nemaker. In this case, which I un- 
derstand much better than you do, 
I give them. I would ask you, Ser- 
geant, to kindly call your men in 
here. 11 

“Sergeant — 1 am the Minister 
for Defense and in this case I can 
speak equally well for the Home 
Office. You will see to it, please, 
that Professor Sanderson does 
not leave this house. 11 

He had forgotten what it was 
like to feel anger, so that he at first 
misjudged his own emotions. This 
was not anger that he felt, a testy, 
petulant resentment of a lesser 
man’s authority. Anger was heat, 
confusion, spite and bile. In the 
heart of the minister, tall and com- 
manding, his trousers creased and 
crumpled a little at the knees, the 
stolid-faced policemen lining up 
at the door, was only a cold, 
withering contempt. He decided 
that the contempt had always 
been there, deep inside himself. 
Contempt for his masters, the lit- 
tle men of power who bought 
knowledge and exploited it for 
their own trivial ends. What he 
felt, he told himself, was scorn and 
a hopelessness — a crystal-clear 
recognition of the doom of a world 
where the potentials of learning 
were siphoned from easy-going 



savants by tribal headmen wield- 
ing the fruits of wisdom with the 
same indifferent abandon as a 
Neanderthaler using a club. 

“You will please step aside. Ser- 
geant. I am going out.” 

“Now, you’d better be sensible, 
sir. There’s nothing you can do out 
there.” 

Society treating him amiably, 
like a child. A foolish old man who 
thought himself capable of using 
his own wisdom without a police- 
man to show him how. He was 
really angry now. He would have 
brushed the sergeant aside or at 
least put him in the embarras- 
sing position of using violence to 
restrain him. He would have done 
so, but he could not. He was frozen 
where he stood, one hand out- 
stretched and the other caught in 
the act of hitching up his trouser 
band to a more comfortable posi- 
tion above the hips. The con- 
stables appeared equally rigid. 
They had suddenly lifted their 
rifles, an odd enough action in any 
case since they were not likely to 
shoot him, but had then found 
themselves immobilized in un- 
gainly postures, staring blankly 
not at him, but through and be- 
yond him. Sanderson found him- 
self, although unable to step for- 
ward or backward, free to turn 
and face the window. And not only 
free but under a compulsion to do 
so. Wannemaker was standing 
like a toy guardsman by his chair 



TIPOFTHE ICEBERG 



25 




and behind him, the large, mul- 
lioned window was slowly open- 
ing, creaking on its hinges. There 
was nothing beyond the window 
but the green-blue tint of the 
morning sky and the outline of the 
trees. Sanderson heard the door 
open behind him he knew that 
Angela was there, standing beside 
him. 

“Rastus is coming,” she said. 

H E COULD not reply. There 
was a dryness in his throat and a 
cold vacuum in his bowels like the 
yearning loneliness of a silent, 
empty night. A dog howled in the 
distance. A nightingale voiced a 
single staccato trilling and snapped 
silent again a quaver short of the 
phrase. A horse in the middle dis- 
tances whinnied. 

Something was breathing heavi- 
ly outside the window. Deep, gut- 
tural rasping sounds of strong 
lungs crying for air. A strangled 
cry. A swirl and rustle of inrushing 
wind and then a crash as the win- 
dow was lifted and fell from its 
hinges and, a moment later, Rastus 
was standing on the ledge. He 
raised himself up and down on his 
huge legs and then crouched for- 
ward, his hands on his knees, his 
teeth bared and gouts of foam drip- 
ping from his lips. He sat for a 
while on his haunches, his mouth 
working and his deep-set red eyes 
resting on each of them in turn. 



Then he jumped to the floor and 
shambled to Angela Styles. 

Hes come to take her , Sander- 
son thought. And nothing we can 
do will stop him. There is nothing 
any of us can do . 

But Rastus did not take Angela 
Styles. He stood in front of her, the 
muscles in his great shoulders 
knotted, his head sunk forward on 
his chest, staring, it seemed, at her 
feet. Whatever he was saying or 
trying to say, the image of himself 
he projected moved her so much 
that she touched him lightly on the 
cheek before sinking into a chair 
and bursting into tears. He stood 
where he was for a long minute 
before raising his hand and 
stroking the spot where her fingers 
had rested. Then, thumping his 
chest, he let out a cry that ought to 
have been of rage or challenge, but 
with all his enemies at his mercy, 
he made no move to attack. In- 
stead he backed to the window 
and, facing them, let out another 
cry. Something, Sanderson knew, 
was about to happen, some 
tragedy about to unfold. Some- 
thing Wagnerian was in the atmo- 
sphere, the dominant figure of 
Rastus like Wotan himself, a 
sullen smouldering of doom in his 
eyes. 

Wannemaker began to come to 
life. He found his arms and his legs 
free, free to back away from the 
menacing shape by the window, to 
dive for the door, tear at the 



26 



GALAXY 




handle, boots and knees against the 
panel, beside himself with fear. 
The door, immobile as the ser- 
geant and the constables, refused 
to open. 

“Shoot him!” he shouted. 
“Shoot him, you fools!” 

Rastus stood where he was, his 
chest rising and falling and his 
breath rasping and steaming 
through his bared, yellow teeth. 
Sanderson could feel his presence 
more clearly now, some glimmer- 
ing of a lowering mental force 
weighing on the air like the im- 
minence of thunder on a sultry day. 
Angela Styles felt it, too, and 
seemed to recognize it for some- 
thing more than a projection of 
loneliness, isolation and fear. She 
dropped her hands from her face as 
the gloom descended, a mush- 
room of mental agony of which 
Rastus was not the source but, in 
some extra-corporeal way, the 
stem and focal point. The cloud 
hovered above and around them 
and, like the mushroom fins, 
something of his positive essence 
radiated toward them. Sander- 
son felt the tingle of its passage, an 
emanation of thought encarna- 
lized, but although it passed 
through him with the emotional 
stirring of particles in a magnetic 
field, he could not have defined it, 
nor interpreted in any visual or 
symbolic sense what it was Rastus 
felt or intended to convey. Angela 
however appeared to understand. 



“No!” she cried. “Rastus! Don’t 
do it!” 

Wannemaker had given up tug- 
ging at the door and turned to face 
him. He seemed calmer now. De- 
liberately and without taking his 
eyes from the great ape’s face he 
took a rifle from the nerveless 
hands of a constable. 

“No!” Angela cried again, but 
she seemed unable to move from 
her chair. They were all fixed and 
rigid except Wannemaker and Ras- 
tus himself. Rastus stood very still, 
staring fixedly at Wannemaker 
until he fired. Then, closing his 
eyes, Rastus crumbled to the floor 
— dead. 

“Straight through the heart,” 
Sanderson said dully, knowing that 
it was so. “He chose you as his ex- 
ecutioner, and guided your hand.” 
“There was nothing else I could 
do,” Wannemaker muttered. 

“No, there was nothing else you 
could do. You fired the shot, but 
we are all equal in the sight of the 
one great unfocused eye. There is 
only one human race.” 

“I don’t know what you’re talk- 
ing about — what eye?” 

“You know he is still there?” 
Angela said, kneeling by the body, 
its head in her hands. “Not Rastus 
himself, but the power we all felt. 
It’s spilling through the eye we 
opened in his head. The third eye. 
Rastus would have let us go and 
put the guilt only on the one, but

THE NO-WIND SPOTTED 

TIGER PLANET 

Pollution was no problem. But 
where were all the people? 

W. MacFARLANE 



W ITH the authority of experi- 
ence, the Mohmu completed 
the interspecies transfer. He was 
projected from warm dark com- 
fort into a bright noisy world of 
physical assault that made him 
take a breath into his new lungs 
and howl with shock. The dis- 
placed entity was lodged in his 
own body with full observation 
and no control, his ship was safe- 
ly stationed a nanosecond in the 
past, and he was overwhelmed by 
sensory input. Any planetary in- 
vestigator knows the best way to 
understand a species is to be- 
come one of them and this is what 
the Mohmu had done, a full iden- 



tity transfer at the moment of 
birth. 

The Mohmu are not chronocen- 
tric. Their physical being is es- 
sentially invulnerable. They 
raise their young in a mindless 
condition and their highest art is 
the design and imprint of intel- 
lect at bodily maturity. Pro- 
gramed as an investigator, with no 
imperatives of time, Brad Sym- 
ons functioned in all depart- 
ments, cried in the night and stud- 
ied his new world. 

He grew older with all deliber- 
ate speed and care. When his fa- 
ther rented a cabin with an un- 
vented gas heater the baby pushed 



28 



a coat stand through a window to 
save the family from asphyxi- 
ation* When his mother cut her 
wrist and fainted he lay on a pres- 
sure point until his father re- 
turned. Later, when he found the 
steering arm of the old Chewy 
cracked and he was too young to 
warn about it, he tugged away the 
log in front of a wheel and let the 
car roll into a tree. 

He was an extraordinarily or- 
dinary child though he was Brad- 
now, Brad-aboard-the-ship and a 
Mohmu, constantly amazed at 
intelligence in such a tentative 
and fragile form, naked to cir- 
cumstance and subject to im- 
probable tensions. He adapted to 
the pattern of this image-manipu- 
lating species and began to pro- 
ject goals for orientation, to ig- 
nore reality and dream the future 
to construct the future. It was a 
profound exercise of will to live in 
distorted time instead of the 
eternal now. 

His parents were caught by a 
storm on a lake and drowned, and 
the boy, who had been an average 
student, settled seriously to work 
and won a scholarship to college. 
He graduated as a cultural 
anthropologist. He took his mas- 
ters at Columbia and his paper on 
Ritual , Taboo and Sexual Prac- 
tice Among the Academic Hier- 
archy became an underground 
classic. It illustrated his complete 
familiarity with the odd juxta- 



positions men call humor and it 
made a lower profile profes- 
sionally desirable. He took a 
teaching job at Euphemia Col- 
lege in Tullataska, Tennessee. 

According to a small group of 
Young Turks on the faculty, Eu- 
phemia was an outstanding ex- 
ample of the stagnant educa- 
tional system — motivational fade- 
out, instruction like a clogged 
leach line from the septic tank of 
knowledge. Brad Symons thought 
the college admirable, a field 
where young animals could exer- 
cise themselves and even more, a 
rich source for his investigation of 
what he privately labeled idioznic- 
roznies and coinkydinks. He had 
observed the hitherto unexampled 
foreshortening of time in man’s 
history, but it was a coincidence 
(odds a million to one) that the id- 
iosyncrasies of Joe Magworth 
(odds meaningless) should bear 
fruit at Euphemia. 

Magworth said, “Okay, Brad, 
step into the field.” 

The other men, Beaird, 
Kramatz, Morgan and Dilwarden 
said they observed a euphoric ef- 
fect, just as if the sun were shining 
on your liver, just as if you were 
eighteen and it was the first warm 
day of summer in a red converti- 
ble and the girl had that unmis- 
takable languid look in her eyes. 

The Mohmu were beyond prim- 
ative technology. Experimental 
physics was plywood, C-clamps 



THE NO-WIND SPOTTED TIGER PLANET

and pipe, electric cable and junc- 
tion boxes, equipment of pains- 
taking complexity. The disci- 
pline had its necessary jargon and 
while Brad understood words like 
check , plug her in and goddamn, 
most of the conversation was 
“thermal inertial diodes steady,” 
and “in-phase beam triads” doing 
as they ought. 

He walked into the circle painted 
on the floor. He was wearing a 
plastic doughnut on his head, a 
wide belt with rods sticking out a 
foot from his waist, a hundred 
strings of macaroni running from 
the doughnut to the rods and down 
to the floor. The tubes were filled 
with coca-cola or chopped alfalfa 
and at the focus of the beams, the 
man disappeared. Brad knew this 
because he had seen Dilwarden 
vanish. Kramatz swung a yard- 
stick through him and Dilwarden 
said he felt it as much as a flash- 
light beam. 

“Get the hell away,” said Mag- 
worth. The men stewed and fretted 
and checked the machinery and 
swore. Beaird got a Polaroid and 
they tried it again, and Brad got a 
look at himself as others saw him. 
All the spaghetti had vanished 
and there he stood like a brick-red 
statue done up in heat-shrink plas- 
tic. 

“Anthropologists are always 
great bastards,” said Joe Mag- 
worth. 

Brad told him that physicists 



were Tinker-toy clowns and his 
mother had been frightened by an 
Erector set. 

M AGWORTH stumbled into 
Brad’s apartment the follow- 
ing Sunday, heavy-eyed and inat- 
tentive to the TV football game. 
Brad was fascinated by football 
as a microcosm of mankind with 
infinite variables in a framework 
and Magworth liked the ballet 
and beer aspects of the game. To- 
day he was preoccupied. 

“I don’t understand it,” he said. 
“The pulling guard missed his 
block, that’s what.” 

“No — damn it, Brad! I got J.B. 
Buckert to come in and he’s a big- 
ger man than you. He’s a very con- 
scientious guy and wanted to 
know why the lights were on at 
three this morning. He weighs 
two-forty and he vanished like 
that little beaker of beer you gave 

^ n 

me, 

“Have another beer.” 

“Right,” said Magworth. “But 
you’re a polka-dot tiger, dammit. 
Every other person checks out 
stripes. Trouble is. I’m not a geolo- 
gist — maybe you’ve a different 
kind of rocks in your* head — and I 
can’t find the money to pay for a 
first-class examination. All the 
college clinic can do is tell me if 
you have athlete’s foot or not.” 
Three months later money was 
no problem. Euphemia was sud- 
denly a peer of the University of 



30 



GALAXY 




Tennessee instead of a shirt-tail 
relation, because of Magworth, 
the Magworth Effect and what 
happened at the demonstration. 

J.B. Buckert was chief of the 
eight-man police force of Tulla- 
taska, dedicated to his job as 
peace officer. He was a graduate 
of Euphemia and often bent the 
law fo favor the student, and when 
outsiders chose the college as a 
symbol of social repression and 
laid plans to raise hell, J.B. had 
early word on the proposal and 
took action. He kept a slush fund 
for worthy purposes and he fi- 
nanced a more particular appli- 
cation of the Magworth Effect. 

What happened was called the 
Incident at Tullataska Creek. It 
flowed Through campus and sub- 
sequently became as well known 
as the Rubicon. The invasion 
was organized. The wire services 
had been notified, a TV crew from 
Nashville was in attendance and 
sympathizers showed up from 
places all over the map. The lo- 
cal students came to watch the 
sophisticated ways of the outer 
world and were caught up in the 
excitement. 

Buckert timed his operation to 
the musical interludes. People 
flung themselves around and, with 
the ecological addicts present, it 
was not surprising when many of 
them embraced trees. The loud- 
speakers blasted at ninety-five 
decibels and few noticed the tree 



fanciers. The TV crew paid atten- 
tion and their sequence of one 
earnest young leader presumably 
overcome by frenzy, wrapping 
both arms around a blue gum, was 
picked up by the networks. The 
lens zoomed in to see handcuffs 
miraculously appear around his 
wrists and that was the tipoff. 
With the leaders embracing 
trees, it wasn’t much of a demon- 
stration. All it did was change the 
course of history. 

J.B. said, “No harm done. We 
turned over the gasoline and dyna- 
mite to the state police. We’re 
lookin’ for the fellas who poured 
molasses in the electric git-tars. 
Handcuffs around trees? Students 
funnin’ is what I say. The fella 
who used the sheepshears on them 
people is also missin’. The crowd 
dispersed nice when the music 
stopped. No trouble a-tall.” 

Anthropologists keep journals as 
teenage girls keep dance pro- 
grams. Brad Symons wrote: “Of 
course it couldn’t stay a secret. 
One reporter found the modified 
heating suits in the police lock- 
ers — Buckert sent a cruiser to 
Nashville to buy them at a sur- 
plus store. Then the Newsweek 
legman caught Dilwarden and 
Beaird up a tree, removing the 
beam projectors. What, cinched it 
was the freshman who covered 
the happening with a Jap job 
and calmly sold an eight-by-ten 
glossy to UP- 1 NS, the one with the

shears in mid-air, chopping off 
long curls.” 

M AGWORTH said, “Hide me. 1 
locked myself in the bathroom, 
climbed out the window onto the 
shed roof, sneaked through the li- 
lacs and got away. There were re- 
porters and TV and guys from 
GM and Westinghouse and when I 
got over the back fence I heard si- 
rens in front.” 

“Have a beer. Relax. It's about 
time for the TV special.” 

Magworth groaned and chugga- 
lugged half a quart of beer. 

A girl on TV said there was no 
excuse to smell like yourself when 
you could smell otherwise and 
Magworth chuggalugged the rest 
of the bottle. The screen went 
blank and then: The Invisible Man. 

“Turn it off!” said Magworth. 
“What am I going to do?” 

“Keep your cool and make out 
like a bandit. The Army and FBI 
and CIA will come around. You 
could try for a warm weather 
foundation like Dr. Salk. Sell out 
to the best bidder. One thing, can 
you detect the Magworth Effect?” 
“Oh, sure, with a diopiter in- 
gaussing perpelator. Buy one at 
any radio supply store.” 

“Write that down for me, Joe.” 
“Okay, and a simple indopitor 
degaussing violator nullifies it. 
Turn it on or off. That’s how we ex- 
ternalized the cuffs. Shall I write 
that down, too?” 



“Please do,” said Brad Symons. 

He spent the evening in the De- 
partment of Anthropology af- 
ter the CIA won the treasure hunt 
and took Magworth under its 
wing. He mimeographed the in- 
formation and addressed the fold- 
ed-over sheets to the mayors of the 
thirty-eight largest cities as re- 
ported by the World Almanac, 
to every fourth company on For- 
tune’s 500 list and the rest to mem- 
bers of the House. As an anthro- 
pologist he deplored interfering 
with his study group, but as a 
Mohmu he thought he should bal- 
ance things off. 

Within six months the genera- 
tion and nullification of the 
Magworth Effect were well un- 
derstood. Brad Symons stayed in 
the center of the action because 
he was the one being on whom 
there was no effect. He had taken 
the precaution of mailing his fly- 
ers in a dozen little towns in an- 
other state and, after the public- 
ity, complete disclosure was the 
policy of the government and he 
was the more or less official his- 
torian. 

His report titled Fear, Hys- 
teria and the Zigzag Future was a 
runaway best seller. This meant 
that a tenth of the population ever 
heard of it, a tenth of that number 
saw a copy and a tenth of those 
opened the book. He had the icono- 
clastic gall to reprint the head- 
lines:

They invalidated the cliche that 
it takes 80% as much informa- 
tion to predict the future as it 
does to achieve it; 99% was avail- 
able and no one foresaw the world 
as it was to become. 

Brad relegated Magworth’s lat- 
est thoughts to Appendix I: 

Assuming that present tech- 
nology depends on past re- 
search, then the incremental 
increase of technology may 
be expressed as 

dS = TSdt 

where S = the present level 
of knowledge 

T = the rate of increase of 
technology 

dt = the temporal incre- 
ment 

This simple first order differ- 
ential equation may be solved 
with the result: 

dS = Tdt 
S 

S = AeTt 

Now if H = S, then: 



oc tech 




but if to = 0 and the constant 
A is assumed to be equal to 
unity, then: 



octech = / (eTt - 1 )dt 



And it got worse for thirty solid 
pages. 

While Senators cried panic and 
Tullataska doubled briefly in 
population from an influx of in- 
dustrial and international spies 
and invisible men were blamed for 
everything from spilled milk to 
earthquakes, the electronics in- 
dustry stamped out millions and 
millions of detectors and neu- 
tralizers. At first they were very 
much like dog whistles with no 
dog to call. The United States ex- 
ported millions for distribution 
in other countries. With the mag- 
nificent human ability to forget 
the past, the Magworth Effect dis- 
tressed almost no one by the end 
of the first year, though the hand- 
writing was on the wall, the beam 
broadcaster had been made por- 
table and the receptors were third 
generation as two-inch-wide belts. 

W HEN Brad Symons wore one 
he still looked like a shiny 
brick statue. Applications of the 
maggie effect proliferated while

fundamental understanding was 
still at the chalk-and-blackboard 
stage, a situation like running 
north from the south rim of the 
Grand Canyon blindfolded, be- 
cause extrapolation projected 
more level desert. The Mohmu 
was thinking about this at the en- 
trance of the Institute when Joe 
Magworth parked his car. Forty- 
six people got out. 

“How do you like that?" asked 
Joe. 

“That rips the rag off the bush," 
said Brad. “I can barely under- 
stand the idea that we’re built of 
atoms miles apart like the solar 
system, so how many angels can 
you jam together on the point of a 
pin?" 

“We figure two hundred thou- 
sand in the same square foot space 
would push the two hundred thou- 
sand and first a foot away. No 
problem." 

“Are you still individual, dis- 
crete and alone with a hundred 
and ninety-nine thousand, nine 
hundred and ninety-nine people 
inside you and around you?" 

“I’ll agree it sounds cozy," said 
Magworth, “but nobody casts a 
shadow. Just like in the begin- 
ning, the sun still shines on your 
liver. A very happy feeling." 

“I think today you bombed the 
transportation industry." 

“That’s the way the cookie 
crumbles,” said Magworth with 
true scientific detachment. 



Where ten planes had flown be- 
fore, one flew now and it was very 
small. Commuter trains became 
the size of a delivery van. Cabs 
had nullifiers and so did every 
building, but elevators used the 
beam and little elevator space 
was needed. In the beginning, for 
all the fail-safes and backup sys- 
tems, moderate disasters oc- 
curred. Nobody enjoyed the idea 
of sixty-three people materializ- 
ing in one elevator and personal 
battery-powered beams worn in 
hats became popular for a while. 
With design improvements, a jet 
crashed after it sucked in a flock 
of Canadian geese over Fargo, 
North Dakota and four hundred 
and thirty-eight people walked 
away from the scene of the acci- 
dent. 

To the surprise of all observers, 
stodgy Washington, D.C. took 
the next step and installed beam 
projectors covering the entire 
city. You could see people in shops 
and restaurants and hear the bee- 
murmur of the great buildings, 
but the sidewalks were deserted. 
Visitors were issued receptors. 
Criminals were sentenced to visi- 
bility. With mandatory nullifier 
implants, they were the only ones 
who walked the streets. A timing 
device was set to the length of the 
sentence, coded to avoid tamper- 
ing, and it worked well. Ostra- 
cism is a powerful force among so- 
cial animals. Some cities took the 



34 



GALAXY 




opposite stance and mounted 
nullifiers in a spirit of independ- 
ence, but they changed their posi- 
tion as the crime rate soared. 

It was much like the process of 
electrification. Central station 
power generation was begun in 
1882 and fifty years later there 
were still communities with oil or 
gas illumination. With the fore- 
shortening of events, the almost 
total spread of the maggie effect 
took five years in the United 
States. 

Brad Symons returned to Wash- 
ington after four months in a 
holdout commune in New Mexi- 
co. He had studied visible towns as 
they went maggie and estab- 
lished the obvious: the sense of 
euphoria was so attractive it be- 
came habit-forming, as life itself 
is habit-forming in spite of multi- 
tudinous drawbacks like tooth- 
ache and taxes. 

rpHE Mohmu designed for inves- 
* tigation are remarkably stable, 
but with complete feedback from 
Brad-aboard-the-ship, Brad-now 
was hungry for the most human 
environment, the city. He thought 
the wide open spaces and mindless 
nature were great for freaks and 
this made the changes in Washing- 
ton doubly shocking. 

Truck traffic had dwindled. Pri- 
vate cars were almost absent. A 
few government vehicles were 
left. The nullifiers were off at the 



Institute and Magworth’s office 
was empty. “Where is everybody!” 
Brad yelled. 

“Hey, Brad.” Magworth ap- 
peared in corporeality. 

“What happened?” 

“I see what you mean. Well, it’s 
just better, is all. Solid bodies are 
great but they’ve got to be fed and 
they catch cold and you have to 
take them to doctors. J think the 
field theory has got to include the 
idea that man gets what he wants. 
Now, I’ve done a little math on 
this—” 

“Another time, Joe.” 

“He dreamed of flying and he 
flew. Dreaming of music for pri- 
vate occasions, he made a record 
player. Dreaming of the moon, he 
made a ladder long enough. You 
see what I mean?” 

“No.” 

“Well, scratch an engineer and 
you find a man who knocks on 
wood. Wary of a hubris of the in- 
tellect, mankind is now wallow- 
ing in a passion of the spirit. De- 
lightful. It’s been indicated by 
magic and superstition and re- 
ligion. Forget the mechanism 
that triggered the reaction, for- 
get the intellectual origin, for- 
get Euphemia and Tullataska 
Creek.” ' 

“What are you talking about? 
Where does it end?” 

“It’s one of the things so ob- 
vious it’s unexamined, but it’s 
characteristic as hunger or fear 



THE NO-WINDSPOTTEDTIGER PLANET

of falling. Mary Coleridge put 
part of it like this: 

Egypt’s might is tumbled down 
Down a-down the deeps of 
thought; 

Greece is fallen and Troy town , 
Glorious Rome hath lost her 
crown , 

Venice’s pride is nought . 

But the dreams their children 
dreamed 

Fleeting , unsubstantial, vain, 
Shadowy as the shadows seemed. 
Airy nothing, as they deemed. 
These remain. 

“You weird people are down the 
tube/’ said the Mohmu. 

“There’s an inbuilt wish for 
transcendental emotional experi- 
ence. That’s the way the buzzard 
burps. That’s the way it is, Brad.’’ 
“Turn off the projectors!" 
“They’re only necessary during 
the learning period, like training 
wheels on a bike. Right now it’s the 
midpoint of the process and 
they’re still on while the rest of the 
people come to the same conclu- 
sion.’’ 

The Mohmu saw no point to 
continuing. “I’ve changed,’’ he 
said. “Have a receptor handy?” 

He put it on. 

Brad Symons vanished. As far 
as the Mohmu could tell, safe and 
warm aboard the ship in his own 



body, living a nanosecond in the 
past had not been perceptible to 
the former Brad-aboard-the-ship. 

Joe Magworth whistled. “Great. 
Another inbuilt is the belief that 
the mysteries are unending. 
You’re an example. Wonderful. 
I’ll have to think more about that.” 

He vanished. 

The Mohmu considered another 
life on Earth. The planet was large 
and only the carnal, crass, ma- 
terialistic cultures, the technical- 
ly advanced countries, had gone 
maggie. 

It was another of the multiple 
paradoxes. He felt a new sensa- 
tion of sand under his own 
Mohmu hide, a dreadful itch to- 
ward chronocentricity, toward 
the unending, mysterious hu- 
man experience. It was an abom- 
inable sensation. 

He left horrible Earth for home 
in desperate search for help — re- 
newed certainty — and faith in the 
massive accumulation of data. 
But first he put up a warning sign 
for unwary passersby in space, the 
first his invulnerable, ubiquituous 
race had ever bothered about: 

TRANSITIONAL SPECIES MAY BE 
HARMFUL TO THE HEALTH 

and he shut out the fear that he 
might be contaminated beyond 
curing, that his Earthly insights 
might be infectious to his own 
eternal gyroscopic genus. ★

sealed: personal 

To: Geoffrey Quest-Profitte, 

M.D. 

Damn it, Geoff, of all times for 
you to be away at The Ethical 
Drug Convention! All I can do is 
write this informally and hope 
that when you get back you’ll 
come straight down here and let 
me show you the biggest break- 
through in the history of the 
company. Company, hell — the 
biggest thing since the scalpel was 
invented. Hang tight, boss. Fend 
off Prexy and his snooper for a 
little while longer while I get it 
written up and he’ll forgive you — 
and therefore me — everything. 

Just to whet your curiosity, 
though, let me tell you that my 
latest requisition is for more 
mice, lot A64 and L073. In case 
it’s slipped your mind what these 
are, the first is Malignancies, in- 
herited, and the second is Carcino- 
ma, induced. The previous three 
lots of each group are cured — re- 
mitted — normal. I mean 100%, 
Geoff — and I mean overnight, 
every time. And the seven litters 
I have so far from the first lot — 
and one from the second, check 
out normal. 

I know as well as anybody does 
how careful everyone has to be 
and how much time and cross- 



checking we have to go through, 
but I’m telling you — this stuff is 
a one-shot, overnight cure not on- 
ly for lesions but for systemic 
metastasization. You don’t be- 
lieve this as you read it and I 
don’t expect you to, so get down 
here and I’ll show you. 

And by the way — before you 
get to polishing up a medal for 
me — this isn’t my discovery. All 
I’m doing is repeating the proce- 
dures of the guy who did discover 
it and I’m going to see to it that 
he gets the credit for it. My re- 
sults-of-record extend back three 
months. His go back four years. 
So hurry back and get your thing 
down here.

P.S. It also cures warts. 

P.P.S. The discoverer is Max Or- 
loff. He’s a neighbor and a friend 
of mine. 

P. P.P.S. On second thought, I’ll 
enclose photocopies of my results. 
Did I mention what the raw mate- 
rials cost? Nothing. 

P.P. P.P.S. If I sound a little man- 
ic — wouldn’t you?

Assistant to the Director 
Just a word to acknowledge your 
efforts during my visit to your 
laboratory. You will of course 
assign my lack of response to a 
deeply ingrained caution — the 
caution so necessary to all of us in 
the ethical drug trade. Above all 
the stature and reputation of the 
firm must be maintained and I am 
sure you will observe the same kind 
of caution. As I predicted, the 
requisitions in question are quite 
justified. Hereafter, however, it 
would be appreciated if you would 
report any new directions in 
research to this office before the 
fact. Keep up the good work.

P.S. by hand. You recognize this as 
a slap on the wrist, very light 
because of the results. For God’s 
sake don’t talk about this on the 
outside — it could start riots. Mat- 
ter of fact, don’t talk about it on 
the inside either. As for your Aunt 



Mollie — I almost fainted. That I 
don’t want talked about again —

To: Geoffrey Quest-Profitte, M.D. 

Director of Research. 

I very much appreciate your 
sending me your interoffice cor- 
respondence with Dr. Verity. It 
was no more than your duty. I 
suggest to you — knowing it is 
hardly necessary — just what you 
suggested to Dr. Verity. We’d best 
keep this in the family. I am 
certainly going to keep it to my- 
self. By the way — I fail to com- 
prehend the reference to “Aunt 
Mollie.’’ Can you elucidate? 

Endorsement : I totally agree with 
you, Dr. Rebate, that the Verity 
file falls into my province as Di- 
rector of Security. 

In response to your request for 
suggestions, I think that first of all, 
Dr. Verity must be isolated — 
without his knowing it. I would 
suggest a security examination of 
his laboratory and papers each

night after hours — and that the 
mailroom be alerted so that his 
correspondence interoffice and 
outside (God forbid) can be ex- 
amined. His telephone can easily 
be put on delay — as is done on 
radio talk-shows — and monitored 
so that before an incautious word 
gets out of the building it can be 
cut. I think that to stop his work or 
to divert it would only alert him. 
Meanwhile I think an outside 
investigation of this Orloff person 
(that name has a bad ring to it. 
Doctor) is indicated, together with 
the nature of his relationship with 
Dr. Verity. 

Who is Aunt Mollie? 

Howlan Beagle, Col., (Ret;) 
Director of Security 

Endorsement : The one thing that 
strikes me is Dr. Verity’s state- 
ment that the raw material costs 
nothing. Can you get me a non- 
technical description of this 
“nothing”? I don’t believe it, of 
course, unless it’s a figure of 
speech. But it worries me. Makes it 
too easy for the competition to 
undersell us once they analyze the 
product. 

Tip Turner 
Director of Sales 

Endorsement : I appreciate a look 
at this file. I wouldn’t say that at 
this stage the matter is in my de- 
partment, but unless we are ex- 
tremely cautious it might well 



be — and a nightmare to boot. I, 
too, very much doubt that this 
Orloff has anything — or Dr. Ver- 
ity either — but the matter should 
be investigated. I will be glad to go 
with whoever investigates this 
person. He may require some 
handling. Let me know.

To: Geoffrey Quest-Profitte, M.D. 
Director of Research 
Sure. You start with the spore 
of Mucor Mucedo. What you 
want is the endospore, but you 
don’t have to excavate for it. Just 
let it develop the germ tube and 
nip it off before it branches. Stick 



40 



GALAXY 




these in your bell jar or whatever 
you’re using for a quick hard vac- 
uum and freeze-dry it. You’ll get 
an aqueous vapor that can be bub- 
bled through distilled water until 
it saturates. Run it into your still. 
What comes out of the top pipe 
you can throw away. Same with 
the bottom. The one in the middle 
is what you call the serum, though 
I wouldn’t — it’s an aromatic ex- 
tract. Does that answer your ques- 
tion? A.V. 



Interoffice Memo 

To: The President 

Here is Turner’s question — 
which mightily impressed me; that 
man knows his trade — and Dr. 
Verity’s answer. For our Sales 
Manager’s information (not yours, 
of course) Mucor Mucedo is the 
common black mold, found in 
soil practically everywhere. The 
endospore is just what the word 
says — the inner white substance 
of the spore. The germ tubes grow 
out of the spore, which cracks 
open its black rind to let it out. 
Precisely what happens in that 
sort of distillation I can’t say with- 
out an analytical series. 

It is, as Turner suggested, rath- 
er alarmingly simple and inexpen- 
sive. Shall I suggest to Dr. Verity 
that he try to synthesize it?

From the desk of: 

Uriah Legree 
Assistant to the President 

Picked up Mr. Flack at prear- 
ranged time, 8:00 A.M. Tuesday, 
driving personal car. Arrived vi- 
cinity Orloff residence shortly af- 
ter 9:00. After considerable excur- 
sions up and down unfashionable 
streets without success, queried 
local gas station, asking for Max 
Orloff. Attendant, Grand OF Opry 
type, overalls, old straw hat even, 
cigar stub interfering with dic- 
tion, said Balzac, Baldaz, Boldass 
or Bolaz? — difficult to tell which 
and not understandable until later. 
Mr. Flack said again, Max Or- 
loff and the native said. Yeah, 
that’s ol’ Baldaz (or Balzac or 
some such) and gave explicit di- 
rections. 

House on top of hill behind 
screen of trees — three, four acres

cultivated, garden vegetables, 
grapes, cow, duckpond, rabbit 
hutch. Sign on door WE LIVE 
WITHOUT CLOTHES. IF THIS 
MAKES YOU UNCOMFORT- 
ABLE PLEASE RING AND 
WE WILL DRESS. IF NOT, 
PLEASE KNOCK. Reached for 
doorbell. Mr. Flack stopped me 
and knocked, said always take the 
sucker at his own measure. 

Door open, man in his forties 
wearing hair to shoulders, beard 
period. Waved us in asking noth- 
ing. Big room, beams, fireplace, 
loom. Weaving at loom young 
woman wearing long yellow hair 
period. Smiled. Second young 
man comes in door at back, sup- 
pose kitchen, wearing full skirt 
long black hair period, says. Oh, 
hello, I’ll get tea. Started to say 
no. Mr. Flack said, Thanks yes. 
Man said, That’s Joyce, woman 
at loom, that’s Jocelyn. Jocelyn 
ties off thread, comes to us, kisses 
Mr. Flack, kisses me just after I 
caught Mr. Flack’s Hold Still 
signal. Mr. Flack introduces him- 
self and me and says we’re from 
Ethicolossus. The man acts very 
glad, says he’s Max Orloff. Sit 
down. Nothing to sit on but great 
big half-filled bright-colored vel- 
vet bags. Mr. Flack sits on one, 
his weight makes it shape itself 
like a kind of chair without legs. 
I try one carefully, lose balance, 
fall into it, it catches me, sure 
enough a chair, much too low but 



GALAXY 




comfortable. Orloff says, Jocelyn 
made them. Jocelyn sits on floor 
in front of, between us. Smiles a 
lot. 

Mr. Flack tells Orloff how im- 
pressed everyone at Ethicolossus 
is with him and his work and a lot 
more about saving the world from 
misery and pain. Orloff takes it 
all in as if he believes every word 
and after a while I think he really 
does. Mr. Flack doing all talking, 
slow and easy, Jocelyn says to 
me Like to see the place? Mr. 
Flack flashes me a quick nod and 
Jocelyn gets up and holds out 
hand. Don’t want hand, don’t want 
to go, but Mr. Flack gives signal 
again and I get up. Jocelyn keeps 
hand. Very unsettling. Go out 
through kitchen, brick and iron 
stove, burning wood I guess. 
Beams, cast-iron and copper, tile 
floor. Big. See larder, root cellar, 
spring house, bedrooms with mat- 
tress covering whole floor, twenty 
cats with names, stories, four dogs, 
doves. Jocelyn tells how they live 
off the land, but only salt, flour, 
matches and the like, not even 
sugar, they keep bees. OrlofFs 
lab. Like Alchemists workshop- 
lot of stuff usually glass is cer- 
amic. Jocelyn says Joyce makes 
it. 

On the way back in she stops 
and takes both my hands and 
says. Oh, please, will Ethicolossus 
buy Max’s discovery? Said I don’t 
know, but maybe. She says, Oh, 



and tears come into her eyes. Says 
it’s been very hard for a long time. 
Max could lose the place. It would 
take such a little bit to let him 
keep it. Went back in. Joyce has 
tray with mugs. All go into big 
room. Mr. Flack and Orloff heads 
together over papers, Max has 
Mr. Flack’s pen. Joyce says, Tea? 
I don’t want it but Mr. Flack 
takes his and gives me the look. 1 
take the big mug, guess Joyce 
made that, too, took a drink. 
Herbs. Awful. Mr. Flack drank 
his all up, so me too. Everybody 
happy enough to make a man 
puke. We leave, both girls kiss 
us, afraid Max Orloff might, too. 

In car, Mr. Flack laughs all the 
way down the hill, says, You’d 
never believe what we got the pro- 
cess for — fifty dollars, a lousy 
Fifty dollars. Only Orloff does not 
know that and will not until he 
shows those papers to a lawyer. 
Told him Orloff about to lose the 
place. Mr. Flack said, Good, 
glad we got there before he moved. 
Said this world is sharks and 
minnows and the minnows live to 
get eaten, that’s what they are for. 

Dropped off Mr. Flack at Ethi- 
colossus, proceeded to county air- 
port for second part of investiga- 
tion. Lunched at airport, caught 
Flight 803 as planned, landed at 
Breed City 3:18 p.m. Hired car, 
proceeded to Mollie Verity neigh- 
borhood, checked out house. 
Trees on street made it like tun-

Dr. Verity, just passing through. 
Miss Verity sounds very hospi- 
table. Drive back and park. Little 
lady bounces off porch glider, 
meets me halfway up front walk, 
takes both hands. Different thing 
from that Jocelyn altogether. Eyes 
bright as headlights, hair graying 
but not much and pulled back so 
tight it hurt into little bun. Apple 
cheeks really. Looked like all her 
own teeth. Gingham dress, blue 
with white polkadots and white 
collar and white tea apron, looked 
like that what’s-his-name that used 
to paint Post covers. Rockwell. 
Harder to believe than naked Or- 
loff. 

Inside, not a word until lemon- 
ade in tall glass with ice and home- 
made ginger and lemon cookies. 
Then all about Albert, how is Al- 
bert, is he working too hard, does 
he look peak-ed? Never had to say 
I don’t see Dr. Verity one month 
to the next. She carried it all. 

Have to say if I didn’t see this 
woman myself, couldn’t believe 
both her and the medical report 
Col. Beagle gave me to read. Re- 
port said total terminal, metasta- 
sis, gone everywhere, weight less 



than 80 pounds, delirium to coma. 
Then spontaneous remission. But 
all that only months ago, now 
healthiest little lady around, full 
of bounce, laughing, always on 
the move. Said it herself — cancer 
did her good. Never had so much 
energy before, nor so much fun. 

No trouble at all getting her to 
talk about it. About A1 Verity 
either. Sun rises and sets on him. 
Golden boy. Not just family 
pride, real miracle worker, all 
that. Couldn’t get her to say what 
if anything he’d done. She was too 
far gone to know. 

But she said this, she said she 
came out of the haze and the pain 
laughing. She says she never felt 
so good in all her life, better even 
than now. She said she saw colors 
she had never seen before, had no 
names for them. Shifting, balanced 
patterns, moving mosaics. Every- 
thing part of the colors — sound — 
click of a spoon, footsteps, air- 
plane — translated into the colors, 
joined them. Then, dreams — im- 
possible flying and living and feel- 
ing dreams, realer than most real 
things. And all the while feeling 
great. 

Then hungry. Couldn’t get 
enough. Her folks and friends 
laughed, then got worried. Gained 
18 pounds in three weeks, all of it 
in the right places, kept on feeling 
good, so not to worry. 

Gave me a piece of fruitcake, 
says it’s Albert’s favorite, says that

Somebody else better do that. 
At least till he finds out from 
someone else. 

Like my job. Lot of different

a better afternoon. Maybe some 
day see that lady again.

Uriah Legree 
Assistant to the President. 

Endorsement : 1 attest to the ac- 
curacy of Legree’s photographic 
eye and telegraphic prose. I can- 
not completely identify with his 
sketches of me, but then, why ca- 
vil? That is not the issue. What is 
most seriously the issue is that the 
treatment she had, however she 
got it or from whom, seems to be 
psychedelic or at least euphoric. 
That won’t do. 

Genteel Flack 
Director, Public relations. 

Endorsement: What is overridingly 
important — and I am astonished 
at the reluctance of both these 
gentlemen to point it out — is that 
this Orloff is a nudist with long 
hair who has an open and irregular 
arrangement with not one, but two 
females. I would advise strongly 
against any association with a 
person of this sort. One can read- 
ily assume what his politics is. 
There are more kinds of security, 



apparently, than these gentlemen 
realize. 

Howlan Beagle, Col. (USA Ret) 
Director of Security. 

Endorsement: As the long-haired 
man would doubtless say, the 
Colonel can cool it. With those 
signed papers in hand there is no 
danger of any such association. 
Dr. Quest-Profitte: when you have 
read through this, see what you 
can do about getting the euphoric 
effect out of the distillate.

Al, I’ve been studying your dia- 
grams of the aromatic rings in 
the Orloff distillate, as well as 
your chromatography charts, and 
it seems to me that there may pos- 
sibly be a parallel or analogical 
similarity between some of these 
fractions and such compounds as 
psilocybin. If so, there may be 
unexpected and certainly unwanted 
side effects. 

Will you please check this out

Director of Research 

I’m impressed. I really wouldn’t 
have thought you or anyone 
could have discovered that ana- 
logue by the rough reports I sent 
up, though it is there if you know 
what to look for. The answer is 
yes — the stuff gives a tremendous 
high and I have the happiest mice 
in the world. If you’re worried 
that people might buy it for that, 
like glue-sniffers, forget it — it 
seems to have no effect on any- 
one but cancer patients. It’ll take 
a lot of testing to prove that out, 
but it seems to be the case — so 
much so that I was about to 
broach the subject of a line of 
research to investigate the dis- 
tillate as a diagnostic. 

Would you favor such an ap- 
proach? I believe it would bear 
fruit — and, rather quickly, at that. 

Work progresses on the syn- 
thesis, which I still think is a vast 
waste of time, but indications are 
that the synthetic product will 
work as well as the natural deriva- 
tive. 

By the way, I dropped over to 
see Orloff the other night and he 
was in seventh heaven. He showed 
me the agreements with Ethicolos- 
sus and I find them extremely 
generous. It’s going to make a 
great deal of difference to a very 
good man. 

Right?

Interoffice Memo 

To: Albert Verity M.D. 

Al, you’ll have to get the eupho- 
ric effect right out of the distil- 
late. Dr. Rebate, Mr. Flack, Mr. 
Turner and I have conferred on 
the matter and it’s unanimous. 
The thing to shoot for is an effect 
no more marked than that of the 
common tranquilizers or so-called 
psychic energizers. That much 
would be fine. Can you do it? 

The answer to your question re 
using the Orloff distillate as a 
diagnostic is, of course, answered 
by the above. 

Geoffrey Quest-Profitte, M.D. 
Director of Research. 



Dear Geoff: 

I’m taking advantage of you, I 
know — and also of a certain sym- 
bolism. This is a letter on plain 
paper and in a plain envelope — 
for plain talk, for once not under 
the engraved umbrella of the Ethi- 
colossus name and image. This is 
me — Al — the guy downstairs who 
shovels mouse turds and tries his 
damnedest to do what he wants in 
the way you say you want it. 

Let me sidle into the subject. 
Years ago there was a wonderful 
English humorist, almost forgot- 
ten today, whose name was Je- 
rome K. Jerome. He was a very 
funny man. He was also gentle, 
quizzical, questioning and bright 



46 



GALAXY 




as hell — one of those rare human 
beings who was capable of explor- 
ing the everyday world as if it were 
a foreign country, full of strange 
practices and heathen idols — which 
of course it was and is. 

Remember one of his simplest, 
gentlest little essays. It was about 
baby dresses. In his day — around 
the turn of the century — it was 
customary to make dresses about 
four feet long for infants. He be- 
gan to wonder about this, as he 
wondered about everything his eye 
lit on, so he went to an expert to 
find an answer. The expert was 
one of those legendary English 
nannies pushing a pram in a Lon- 
don park. “Why do babies wear 
such long dresses?” he asked her, 
and she replied, just this side of 
shock: “My goodness, sir! You 
wouldn’t have them in short 
dresses, would you?” 

Now the point of the essay isn’t 
that she didn’ know and was ad- 
mitting it. The point is that she did 
know and that was her answer. 
Further, it was an answer that ab- 
solutely satisfied her, the kind of 
answer you find at the end of a 
theorem, or carved on a tablet of 
stone for Moses. 

We’ve run head on into one just 
like that. You want me to take the 
“upper” effect out of what I’ll be 
so incautious as to call a cancer 
cure. I understand what you’re do- 
ing. You’re protecting Ethicolos- 
sus against charges which might 



be brought against it once the news 
was out. I’ll concede that they 
will be made when it gets out. But 
it seems not to have occurred to 
you that the charges can be re- 
futed — and should be. 

First of all there’s a safety fac- 
tor. I think it will be proved be- 
yond doubt that that euphoric ef- 
fect will not occur except in the 
presence of malignancy. But ab- 
solutely aside from that — did it 
ever occur to you to ask, “What’s 
the matter with sick people feel- 
ing good?” 

Why is it that morphine is the 
mainstay in terminal analgesis? 
You know as well as I do that 
there are a dozen or a score other 
drugs which will kill pain as well 
or better, which are not used sim- 
ply and solely because they are 
euphorics. It isn’t a medical is- 
sue, it’s a moral one — and it’s the 
kind of morality that has no place 
in medicine — not the kind Hippo- 
crates was talking about, nor my 
kind either. It’s the kind of moral- 
ity that forced the Chinese doctor 
to examine his female patients by 
means of an ivory doll passed 
through the curtains, marked 
where it hurt. It’s the kind that 
made anatomical dissection virtu- 
ally impossible for over a thou- 
sand years. 

We don’t give euphorics to dy- 
ing patients because somehow it’s 
wrohg for them to go out feeling 
good. We do a little something to

keep them from feeling too bad 
or from feeling at all — but some- 
how it’s immoral to let them go 
out happy. 

In the case of Orloffs distillate 
we have to think one step further. 
Suddenly I see the whole R & D 
of this amazing substance aborted 
because patients might feel good — 
not while they’re dying, but while 
they’re getting well! 

I’d hate to have to explain that 
to a man from Mars. 

Hey, Geoff— I’m really grate- 
ful that I have your shoulder to 
cry on in private like this. I get 
frustrated from time to time and 
this helps.

There is very little I can say in 
response to your good letter, ex- 
cept that I share in your pleasure 
in this means of making yourself 
feel better. It seems to me that 
the proper place and time for in- 
vestigations into the philosophy 
and morality of the healing arts is 
at two in the morning after too 
much weak beer in one’s second 
year of medical school. These 
things can hardly be the concern 
of men of our degree of age and 



experience, especially not on 
company time. 

I will go so far as to point out 
to you that our function in phar- 
maceuticals is to serve medical 
practice, not to alter it. Let physi- 
cians make these alterations. 
When and if they do, we shall ac- 
commodate them. We can do no 
more. We must do no more, Dr. 
Verity. 

I do not think your letter was 
what, in law, is called a responsive 
answer to my query as to the pos- 
sibility of recompounding the Or- 
loff distillate in such wise as to re- 
duce or eliminate the deleterious 
side effects. Please advise me.

Why don’t you square with 
yourself if not with me? The Or- 
loff distillate will disappear into 
the archives (and now I understand 
why your terms with Max were 
so generous: they were all contin- 
gent on production; now for fifty 
lousy dollars you’ve gained all 
right and title to his discovery) 
and it is being buried 

— because Max Orloff has no 
medical degree 

— because he is a known ec- 
centric 

— because the distillate can be 
easily produced from readily 
available materials, duplication is 
likely and profit is small, or 
— because a big markup 



couldn’t be concealed 

But mostly because the exis- 
tence of such a treatment would 
send shudders through the Big 
Machine and all its many parts — 
Ethicolossus, the pharmacists, the 
doctors, the hospitals, the hospi- 
tal-supply firms, the “chronic” 
rest-homes and all their heirs and 
assigns, cohorts and confederates. 

And I quit. 

I resign with great joy — not be- 
cause I am defeated in this pro- 
ject, but because Orloff and his 
work and his way of life are big- 
ger than anyone’s business or 
career or prestige and I want no 
part of any of that. You will call 
me a dropout, but I will go ahead 
with the healing I was trained 
for — and with no more dirt on my 
hands than I get from weeding the 
eggplant patch. You’ll never pin a 
malpractice on me because I am 
on to you. The papers Orloff 
signed are no good to you because 
Orloff exists and the distillate ex- 
ists and I exist — and because of 
that people are just going to get 
better and they’ll pay for it by 
harvesting tomatoes and chopping 
wood. And here’s one more thing 
to think about. With Orloff — es- 
pecially with me and Orloff — 
there’s more where that came 
from; more products, processes, 
ideas. 

But you don’t want to hear any 
of this. You can’t, can you?

FALLING THROUGH 
THE WORLD 



DUNCAN LUNAN 



Up was down and down was up, but 
there was only one way to go! 





WTTEY, MAC! Have you got a 
“minute?” 

McKay turned. Slazeck was 
coming out of the Communica- 
tions Room. 

“I was just starting to look for 
you,” said Slazeck. “We’ve some- 
thing coming in from space.” 

“A starship, you mean?” 

“No, something physically com- 
ing from deep space. It’s about the 
moon’s distance out right now.” 
They went back into Communica- 
tions and Slazeck plugged into the 
perception circuits of the Inter- 
face equipment. McKay did the 
same through his personal com- 
municator. 

“There it is.” Slazeck brought 
out the relevant head-up display. 
The circuits gave a direct input to 
the perception centers of the 
brain. “It’s making no signals 
and it’s quite small, whatever it is. 
But the scanners definitely think 
it’s artificial.” 

“Do we have a visual sighting?” 
The symbol display merged into 
the section of the heavens con- 
taining the intruder. The star- 
field grew richer as magnification 
increased but nothing else came in- 
to view. 

“It really is small.” 

“Doesn’t mean we can ignore it, 
unfortunately,” said McKay. 
“Earth has some deadly com- 
panions orbiting the sun these 
days, despite the clean-up efforts 
of the Furtherance teams after 



the battle. In the good old days, 
the Sasarenn installations would 
have taken care of it,” he added 
ironically. 

“Innocent or guilty,” Slazeck 
agreed. “But from its trajectory, 
this one is guilty. With stuff being 
thrown every way during the bat- 
tle, some of it is bound to inter- 
sect Earth’s orbit again.” 

“Right. Try a recognition pulse, 
anyway.” 

“No response,” said Slazeck a 
few moments later. “It’s a missile 
for my money, Mac.” 

“I think so. It’ll be in range in 
twelve hours. We can put it on ice 
while we make certain.” 

“Always supposing it doesn’t de- 
struct when you put an Interface 
in front of it.” 

“That, too, is possible.” McKay 
sighed. “We can shield Earth from 
the heat flash, but there would be a 
communications blackout.” He 
came off the circuit, “returning” 
to the room with its curiously 
blank-faced equipment. “Okay, 
I’ll call Lang and get the Commit- 
tee for Earth’s Defense alerted. I 
can just imagine how pleased 
they’ll be.” 

He was becoming quite used to 
this juggling act between two alien 
technologies and the worried au- 
thorities of Earth. The Interface, a 
multiracial culture linked by inter- 
stellar matter-transmitters, had 
reached Earth some time before, 
immediately preceded by the war

fleet of the reptilian Sasarenn, who 
opposed the spread of the Inter- 
face. The Sasarenn had occupied 
the Earth-moon system for three 
months, with McKay their reluc- 
tant planetary agent, before the 
Furtherance (the Interface survey 
fleet) broke through the blockade 
and pitched them out. That left 
Earth, somewhat shaken, newly 
enrolled in the Interface with 
McKay still planetary agent, still 
flying the Recovery and Liaison 
Vehicle thrust upon him by the 
Sasarenn. Dealings with the In- 
terface to date had not simplified 
the situation in the least. 

The Committee for Earth’s De- 
fense seldom made McKay’s life 
easier. When he telephoned Lang 
at the U.N. he had some trouble 
making the situation clear. 

Lang wanted to know, “Can’t 
you send a camera missile to in- 
tercept before it gets nearer 
Earth?” 

“The thing’s just inside the 
moon’s orbit,” McKay said 
patiently, “making about three 
miles a second toward Earth. The 
maximum range of the Interface 
relay is ten thousand miles, as you 
know. We can throw a missile out 
from that with any speed you like, 
depending how far out you want 
the rendezvous, but the faster it 
goes the more accurate our aim 
has to be. Even if our aim is on tar- 
get we’ll only get a glimpse in pass- 
ing, and by the time we’ve evalu- 



ated that glimpse and decided to 
destroy the thing, the missile will 
be well out of range.” 

“But if you wait we may get a 
thermonuclear explosion within 
ten thousand miles of Earth.” 

“Too early for that worry. As 
soon as it’s in range I’ll put an In- 
terface in front of it. If it doesn’t 
blow then, I’ll bring it to rest and 
look it over. If it’s dangerous I’ll 
drop it through Interface into a 
disposal area.” 

“It had better work,” said Lang. 
“If the Van Allen Belt is dis- 
rupted the international sci- 
entific community will go 
crazy — to say nothing of the mili- 
tary reaction!” 

“I’m fed up to here with both of 
them,” McKay replied sourly. “A 
member of the international sci- 
entific community managed to 
put the RLV on full combat alert 
yesterday, trying to map the 
power section interior with ultra- 
sonics. I can’t get them to believe 
the ship’s conscious and suspi- 
cious of them.” 

“Okay, Mac, point taken. We’ll 
leave it with you. Keep us posted 
on developments.” 

T HERE were no developments 
until late that evening when the 
object fell into Interface range. 
McKay had considered taking the 
RLV up to the space station and 
handling the interception from 
there but had decided there was no 



FALLING THROUGH THE WORLD 



53 




point. With the perception cir- 
cuits annihilating immediate 
surroundings, the crew missed 
nothing by the ship’s remaining 
at the Montana spacefield. They 
had visual sighting of the stranger 
now, but it was still only a speck 
among the stars. 

“Here goes, then.” McKay had 
set the Interface relay to bring the 
object to rest where it was. ‘ 'Up 
Interface — ” 

An intricate tracery of symbols 
filled the head-up display for a sec- 
ond and was replaced by one word: 
Negative. 

“What the hell? Up Inter- 
face — ” 

The word swam in their heads 
again. 

“What’s going on?” Lang asked. 
He was plugged in on sound only, 
in New York. 

“The object is inhibiting the 
space around itself from Inter- 
face contact,” McKay told him, 
working furiously with the com- 
puter input. “I’m working back 
to find the limit of the interfer- 
ence.” 

“What could cause such inter- 
ference? Is this object of non-In- 
terface origin?” 

“Perhaps it’s an Interface relay 
itself,” said McKay. “Several 
were lost in the battle, believed de- 
stroyed.” 

“The limit of the interference is 
eighty miles,” he announced a 
minute later. “I’m sending out a 



camera probe now. Stand by — ” 
They waited eagerly for the 
probe to close the distance. “You 
watch the picture, Walt,” McKay 
said at last. “I’ll slow up the rock- 
et.” 

Watching the electronic display, 
McKay turned the probe and pre- 
pared to match velocities. 

“I have visual sighting,” Sla- 
zeck reported. “Object roughly 
spherical, coming up fast — It is 
an Interface relay.” 

“Okay.” McKay fired the 
probe’s motor and brought it 
alongside. “Let me see — ” 

The relay was roughly spheri- 
cal, built up of solid-state compo- 
nents in a complex pattern; but 
one side of it had become a glassy, 
fused mass. 

“Sasarenn beam damage,” he 
said. “Receivers knocked out, ob- 
viously — that explains why it 
was never recovered.” 

“That ends that panic,” said 
Lang with obvious relief. “Are 
you going to blow it up now?” 

“I don’t think so,” said McKay. 
“Where’s it going to fall?” 

“In the South Atlantic,” Dev- 
lin, the third member of the team, 
reported. “Off Cape Horn, but 
well away from land.” 

“Well, then, no need to worry,” 
said McKay. “Unless it burns out 
in the atmosphere we’ll try to sal- 
vage it after splashdown.” 

“Can’t you pick it up in space?” 
asked Lang, anxious again. 



54 



GALAXY 




“There isn’t time for that. It’ll be 
in the atmosphere in about twenty 
minutes.” 

“Your coolness amazes me,” 
said Lang. “What if it burns up?” 

“Then we can’t recover it.” Lang 
was being unusually dense today. 

“Shouldn’t it, therefore, be de- 
stroyed now?” 

“No, dammit. We should recov- 
er it if we can, but it’s not worth 
risking life for a snatch in space. 
There’s no danger in letting it fall 
into the sea.” 

Lang’s misgivings disappointed 
McKay. So far Earth’s only deal- 
ings with Interface civilization had 
been a few RLV missions flown by 
McKay, Slazeck and Devlin on be- 
half of the Furtherance teams 
opening up this part of the 
Galactic spiral for Interface 
traffic. Lang and McKay were 
agreed that there must be more 
contact with the member races of 
the Interface, and recovering an 
Interface relay, worth a planet’s 
ransom, would help this along. 
They waited while the relay fell on 
into the atmosphere; as McKay 
had hoped, the defensive field still 
operating acted as a heat shield 
and the unit decelerated steadily. 
As the ionization around it dis- 
persed a radio beacon came on, 
calling for pickup. 

“Let’s go,” said McKay. He had 
brought the RLV across to the con- 
trol buildings and they were al- 
ready suited up for the flight. The 



ship took off on VTOL jets, con- 
verting to forward thrust, then 
to ramjets as it pulled up to the In- 
terface corridor Air Traffic had 
laid out, away from the field. 

A T FIVE thousaind feet McKay 
contacted the orbital relay, a 
unit identical to the one they were 
after, but positioned in stable or- 
bit around the Earth. There were 
similar units for Mars, Jupiter 
and Venus now, and for other 
points of interest along the great 
staircase of stars the Further- 
ance had reached. Any of them 
could be reached in seconds, once 
the void had been crossed to posi- 
tion the relays — a task to which at 
least one member race had dedi- 
cated all its resources. 

“Up Interface — ” said McKay 
to the ship’s computer-autopilot. 

They were climbing into a night 
sky with a few stars showing 
through clouds lit by a first-quar- 
ter moon. In the south Atlantic it 
was nearly dawn, so the half-mile 
disk of the Interface was full of 
pale, cold clouds. The RLV flew in- 
to it and there was the sea below 
them, with Cape Horn out of sight 
two hundred miles to the west and 
a black circle of Montana sky 
hanging impossibly behind them. 
After a few seconds the disc 
vanished, leaving them alone. 

McKay activated the RLV 
search devices. “That sea looks 
pretty rough,” he said. “We won’t 



FALLING THROUGH THE WORLD 



55 




be able to touch down, so the pick- 
up’s going to be tricky.” 

“You said it,” said Devlin. “I’ll 
go aft and try to get it figured out.’" 

McKay was sure he’d think of 
something. The RLV — Recovery 
and Liaison Vehicle — had been 
designed to make rescues and pick- 
ups in all extreme conditions. How- 
ever, the search devices were 
having trouble. By now they should 
have been on top of the splash- 
down, but the ship hadn’t detected 
the downed relay’s position. The 
satellite overhead had lost it as 
'well. 

“I think I’ve got it figured,” 
Devlin reported. “How near are we 
to the pickup?” 

“Can’t find the target at all,” 
said McKay. “Stay back there. I’m 
starting a search pattern.” 

After an hour he gave up. If the 
relay had been transmitting any- 
where in that area of sea they 
would have found it long before. 
And if the beacon had gone dead it 
would be pure chance even for the 
RLV’s sensors to find it in that 
tumbling waste. Most likely it had 
hit too hard, damaged as it was, 
and gone straight to the bottom. 

Four days later McKay was with 
the station commander at the 
Montana field when Slazeck 
•phoned from Communications. 
“We’ve picked up that relay’s 
beacon again.” 

“It’s come back to life? Where is 
it now?” 



“Two hundred fifty miles off the 
Cape of Good Hope.” 

“You mean Cape Horn — Good 
Hope’s the tip of Africa.” 

“That’s the one I mean. To be 
more accurate, it’s off Cape St. 
Francis. That satellite is out in the 
Indian Ocean.” 

McKay swore. If Slazeck told 
you the world was coming to an 
end he still wouldn’t make it sound 
serious. “Okay, get out to the ship 
on the double. We’ll grab the thing 
before it moves again.” 

When he got to the ship Slazeck 
and Devlin were already aboard. 
Cathy, Devlin’s fiancee, was wait- 
ing in the hangar. 

“Can I come for the ride, Mac?” 
“Sure, if you want to.” As 
Lang’s assistant, Cathy was a 
valued member of the RLV team. 
“There shouldn’t be anything for 
you to do on this mission, though.” 
“There’s nothing for me to do 
here today.” They ducked under 
the fuselage and stepped on to the 
outer door/ramp of the RLV air- 
lock. Once aboard, he showed her 
to a G-couch and went forward to 
the controls. 

“One thing I don’t understand, 
Mac,” the girl said as the ship 
climbed away. “I thought it was 
theoretically impossible for a re- 
lay to project itself through Inter- 
face?” 

“So I’ve always been told,” said 
McKay. “So this one must be 
interfering in some way with the 



56 



GALAXY 




Earth-orbital relays. That’s why 
we have to neutralize it at once.” 
"‘Where has it been for the last 
four days?” 

‘‘Who the hell knows?” McKay 
replied with a shiver. “A bigger 
hazard to navigation than a rogue 
Interface relay would be difficult 
to imagine.” 

O N THE Indian Ocean the day 
was beautiful. The Interface had 
appeared as a circle of flawless 
blue against the Montana thunder- 
clouds and the relay, when they 
found it, was floating peacefully in 
a calm sea. 

‘‘We don’t get to try your idea 
after all, Dev,” said McKay as he 
made his approach. “You’ll be 
able to reach out and pull the thing 
aboard.” He set the ship down 
vertically, starting up the fans of 
the air-cushion pads and moving in 
on the floating satellite. “Opening 
lock now.” 

“I have a line on it,” Devlin re- 
ported soon. “Bringing it in now. 
Open cargo hatch, please.” 

“Cargo hatch open.” 

“Second line attached — reel it 
in. Satellite coming aboard now. 
We’d better hurry this up, Mac, the 
weather doesn’t look so good from 
out here.” 

“The weather? Good grief, 
you’re right.” A haze had come up 
from nowhere and was beginning 
to obscure the sun. As the scene 
grew darker the sea looked more 



threatening. “My God, that’s a 
sudden change. Is the satellite 
stowed?” 

“Clamps closing now.” 

“Okay, I’m closing the cargo 
hatch. Get back in and shut the 
lock.” 

“Ready for takeoff,” Devlin re- 
ported a minute later. The motion 
of the ship in the waves was be- 
coming noticeable. 

“Okay, I’m taking her up.” 
McKay started up the VTOL jets 
and eased the ship up from the wa- 
ter, correcting as the wind took 
hold. “This is going to be a real 
storm down here,” he said as he 
converted to forward thrust. 

“Came up out of nowhere, didn’t 
it?” 

The sun was gone now and the 
haze was thickening into clouds 
blowing over them with sur- 
prising speed. 

“I don’t know what this is, 
Mac,” said Slazeck, “but I recom- 
mend we get above it.” 

“Gladly,” said McKay. “But I 
can’t gain more height.” 

“Systems check,” ordered Sla- 
zeck. The computer display cas- 
caded over the field of view. “We 
have green lights on all systems, 
Mac.” 

“We have full power on the jets 
and can’t climb,” said McKay. “If 
this gets any worse we can’t even 
stay airborne.” 

“Look ahead, Mac!” yelled 
Cathy. 



FALLING THROUGH THE WORLD 



57 




A shallow depression had 
appeared in the sea ahead. In 
seconds it became a bowl and then 
a sheer pit, still expanding in size, 
until the far side was lost in the 
thickening mist. 

“That’s not a whirlpool, it’s an 
Interface!” shouted Slazeck. 
“That water’s going down 
vertically!’’ 

“Into what, for God’s sake?” 
cried McKay, still fighting to keep 
the ship up. “Can anybody see 
what’s down there?” 

“We’re going over the edge — ” 

Cathy shrieked. She sounded 
terrified and who could blame her? 
The awe-inspiring sight was like 
the edge of doom and already the 
ship was below normal sea level. 

“Our jets are powerless against 
this downdraft,” McKay snapped 
as they went down with the thun- 
dering wall of white water. “Rock- 
et acceleration warning, primary 
boost in five seconds.” He banked 
sharply away from the cascade, 
stood the RLV on its tail and fired 
the fusion sustainer motor. A 
blinding jet of blue flame stabbed 
down into the abyss. 

“I don’t believe this,” he 
murmured as the rocket-seconds 
ticked on and on. They had ex- 
pended enough fuel to go far out in- 
to space and still the edge of the ti- 
tanic waterfall was lost above 
them. 

“Go to secondary boost, Mac, 
please,” Cathy implored. 

58 



“We can’t, honey," Devlin said 
soothingly. “If we use secondary 
boost down here we’ll melt our- 
selves.” 

“Okay, cut-off,” said McKay. 
The ship stalled instantly, almost 
crashing into the wall of water be- 
fore he regained control. 

“Let’s keep that down,” mur- 
mured Slazeck as they banked out 

t 

from it again. 

“Let’s all calm down,” said 
McKay. “The ship’s fully func- 
tional and we’re not about to hit 
anything. I want to hear some 
thinking about what’s happened to 
us.” 

“First thought,” said Devlin 
immediately. “Stop circling and 
fly along the face of this thing.” 

“Okay.” McKay leveled out. 
“Basis?” 

“It doesn’t look like the curved 
side of a pit any more,” said Dev- 
lin, “and we lost sight of the other 
side even before we fell in. If this is 
a flat sheet of water it must have 
edges.” 

“Radar shows nothing ahead,” 
said McKay. “Incidentally there’s 
no change in outside air pressure, 
though on visual evidence we’ve 
already fallen miles.” 

A FTER thirty minutes there was 
no sign of an edge to the water- 
fall, nor of a bottom' to it. 

“There’s no way out,” McKay 
heard Cathy whisper. 

“Nonsense,” he said sharply. 

GALAXY 




“Interface has thrown us into 
some weird situations before this. 
We were a month in pitch dark- 
ness once, remember? We don’t 
give up on this one so soon, when 
the ship’s still in good shape.” 
“What do the search devices 
show so far, Mac?” Slazeck 
asked. As always he was calm. 

“Search devices show nothing. 
According to inertial guidance 
we’re flying in a straight line — but 
there’s nothing ahead of us, be- 
hind, above, below, or opposite to 
the water. The artificial horizon 
says we’re nose-up all the time, by 
the way, but if I level out we start 
gaining airspeed.” 

“It’s like the old flat-Earth 
legend,” said Devlin. “The sea 
falls off the edge.” 

“If I see giant elephants or 
turtles I’ll let you know,” McKay 
promised. 

“Do the instruments give us any 
kind of position in relation to the 
Earth’s surface?” asked Slazeck. 

“Not a thing,” said McKay, 
checking. “We’re in limbo, it 
seems.” 

“I think you’re right there,” 
Slazeck agreed. “The fact that we 
can’t fly upward suggests that 
we’re not in normal space at all.” 
“Now we’re getting somewhere. 
What kind of space are we in, 
though?” 

“I think — on the evidence so 
far — it’s finite but unbounded. 
Look, an Interface only lasts about 



half a minute. There’s a limit to 
how much water can fall through 
it, however deep in the sea it was. 
And when we were above this thing 
it looked like a cylinder. The sides 
didn’t look straight until we were 
inside.” 

“I see,” McKay said slowly. “So 
this airspace is curved back on it- 
self through a fourth spatial di- 
mension. Though our eyes and our 
three-D inertial guidance say we’re 
flying in a straight line, we’re 
actually spiralling down a four-D 
cylinder.” 

“More complex than a 
cylinder,” said Slazeck. “I can’t 
visualize an analogous shape in 
three dimensions at all. Look, this 
wall of water seems to extend to in- 
finity above and below us, and 
that’s just as impossible as its 
lateral extension.” 

“Ow.” McKay rubbed his 
forehead under the pressure hel- 
met. “So it’s closed in a fifth 
spatial dimension as well. There 
really is no bottom to it in our 
vertical.” 

“Right. There’s nothing here but 
air and water, however, so we can’t 
mark any point so as to recognize 
when we next passed.” 

“We could trail smoke, but it 
would probably disperse in all this 
water vapor before we went around 
the fourth- and fifth- D loops and 
came back to it.” 

“There’s a point,” said Devlin. 
“How come the waterfall’s still 



FALLING THROUGH THE WORLD 



59 




there? With the accumulating ki- 
netic energy of this endless drop 
you’d think it would all be vapor by 
now.” 

“There’s lots of vapor around us. 
Visibility’s a few hundred yards at 
most. Probably just as well for our 
sanity — if the fourth-D radius is 
only a couple of miles, say, we 
could see ghost images of our- 
selves!” 

“But the falling water isn’t ac- 
celerating now any more than we 
are,” said Slazeck. “Each drop of 
water over there has reached its 
terminal velocity in air.” 

T HEY all looked again at the 
raging white wall. “Staggering 
thought, isn’t it?” 

“Back to work,” said McKay, 
tearing his eyes away from the hyp- 
notic display of force. “How has 
this multidimensional phenome- 
non come into being? It’s new in 
human experience.” 

“You may be wrong there,” said 
Slazeck. “I’ll tell you — what put 
the idea into my head was the start- 
ing point. Years ago I read a piece 
about five areas in the world where 
unusual numbers of ships and air- 
craft vanished without trace. They 
all lay in the oceans to the east of 
the continents — off North and 
South America, South Africa, 
Australia — and they were all the 
same oval shape and size. The 
thought occurred to me then, 
quite fancifully it seemed, that 



there might be some con- 
gruence — some pverlapping of 
those areas in multidimensional 
space.” 

“So the thing’s a natural phe- 
nomenon,” said Cathy. “Was it 
the origin of the flat-Earth legends 
and the edge of the world, do you 
think?” 

“Can’t be. Nobody who saw it 
could survive until now. Even air- 
craft pulled in would run out of fuel 
eventually — and anything falling 
into that water would be smashed 
to pieces. We must be the first nu- 
clear-powered machine in here.” 
“That’s one big advantage we 
have anyway,” said Devlin. “Since 
we’re not burning fuel we can keep 
flying on jets forever.” 

“Oh, no,” said Cathy. “Like an 
airborne Flying Dutchman. Why 
this is Hell , nor am / out of it — ” 
“No, no,” said McKay gently. 
Cathy was still recovering from a 
bad time on the RLV’s last 
mission, regaining her confidence. 
“The relay made it through, pro- 
tected by its defensive field, in 
four days. All we have to do is keep 
flying and we’ll get out eventu- 
ally.” 

“It will take more than four days 
to fly through,” Slazeck pointed 
out. “The water’s falling a lot 
faster than we are.” 

“If we just dive, we’ll pick up 
more speed until we reach the 
ship’s thermal limit. We could 
hold the speed back, but I wouldn’t 



60 



GALAXY 




care to fly on airbrakes for days 
on end.” 

“Agreed,” said Slazeck with a 
professional shudder. 

“Another point has occurred to 
me,” McKay said after some mo- 
ments. “We thought the relay had 
gotten to the Indian Ocean by in- 
terfering with the orbital units. 
But in fact it must interact with 
this natural spacewarp, getting 
into it and out again via Interface. 
From our viewpoint in the outside 
world, the fall through the warp 
took four days and we’ve been 
down here for more than an hour 
already. But there’s still light here, 
which can only be coming from the 
open ends, one or both. And those 
ends, being Interfaces, are only 
open for thirty seconds of real 
time.” 

“I copy,” said Slazeck reluc- 
tantly. “We’re outside normal 
time as well as space. To us, the fall 
could take any amount of 
time — millions of years, maybe.” 

“Equally, it may be nearly 
over,” McKay said hastily to keep 
Cathy from despair. “My thought 
was that the far end of this may be 
open to us right now if we can find 
the way to it.” 

“Suggest we begin with the In- 
terface relay, since we seem to be 
agreed it got us into this,” said 
Slazeck. 

“Agreed. You take over, Walt, 
and Dev and I will take a look at 
this beast we’ve brought aboard.” 



T HOUGH the artificial horizon 
still said the ship was nose up, 
the floor was flat underfoot. Mc- 
Kay and Devlin walked to the rear 
of the main cabin and opened a 
floor hatch into the cargo space. 
There lay the gray sphere of the re- 
lay, dry now and faintly stained 
with salt. 

“I’m not sure we can risk fool- 
ing with this,” said Devlin. “That 
molten damage goes pretty deep 
inside and we know nothing about 
its technical principles. Obviously 
parts of it are erratically active and 
who knows how sensitive it is.” 
“Sure,” said McKay. “I wasn’t 
thinking of tampering with it as 
much as possibly opening the lower 
hatch and dropping it. Maybe it’s 
only the relay that’s holding us in-/ 
side the warp and we’d find our- 
selves back over the Indian 
Ocean.” 

“Or maybe a thousand miles un- 
der South Africa,” Devlin replied. 
“We can’t tell where we are right 
now, projected on normal space. 
Besides the relay then goes on in 
harmonic motion to and fro in the 
warp — and we still have to find it 
again and dispose of it. Let’s hang 
on to it now we have it.” 

“Well said.” They closed the 
hatch and stood up. “Of course we 
may be wrong to blame the satel- 
lite. Every time we bring this girl of 
yours we get into trouble.” 

“You’re not putting her off,” 
said Devlin. “Jonah or not!” 



FALLING THROUGH THE WORLD 



61 




Back at the controls, McKay 
plugged in and scanned the all- 
around visual display. Their 
situation was unchanged: they 
were still flying through a misty 
abyss, featureless except for the 
vertical tumult of water to port of 
the ship. “Where does the light 
come from?” he asked, after more 
thought. “Obviously not from the 
water; yet it’s so diffused around 
us that we’re casting no shadow on 
the water. Somewhere there’s an 
Interface feeding that light in 
here — why can’t we see it?” 

“Obviously the inner structure of 
this warp is still more compli- 
cated,” Slazeck commented. 
“We’re moving along the periph- 
ery — and even that we can’t con- 
ceive of except as a mathematical 
abstraction.” 

“It must have a center,” said 
Cathy. “Maybe if we cut across 
that we can get out.” 

“It doesn’t have to haVe a cen- 
ter — ” McKay began. 

“Yes it does. The outstanding 
characteristic of this space-within- 
space is its gravity field.” 

McKay thought for a moment. 
“It’s not a true gravity field, 
Cathy, because it’s impossible to 
overcome it. It’s just an effect of 
the curvature of space here.” 

“All gravity is an effect of the 
curvature of space, if I remember 
Einstein,” said Slazeck. “I think 
Cathy’s right, Mac. A five-dimen- 
sional space doesn’t have to allow 



free movement symmetrically inj 
all of the dimensions, does it?” 

“I haven’t any idea,” said Mc- 
Kay. “But if there is a normal 
gravity field in a new kind of space, 
it should have a neutral point 
somewhere.” 

“It’s Earth-normal gravity,” 
said Devlin. “I think it's just 
Earth’s field channeled through 
this warp. There won’t be a neutral 
point — but the way out must be 
right along the center of that chan- 
nel.” 

“What brains we have!” said 
McKay. “Do you realize the ship’s 
computer isn’t equipped to test out 
these intuitive jumps with math?” 

“I don’t care,” said Devlin. “The 
theory does seem intuitively cor- 
rect. If we continue to fly around 
the fourth- and fifth-D curves of 
this space we’ll ultimately reach 
and pass some kind of mid-point 
beyond which the warp leads back 
to normal space. The instruments 
will show we’re diving involun- 
tarily — and the water would fall 
upwards — if we could see it from 
here.” 

“All right, accepting that, I 
don’t think we can short-cut the 
trip in that case. We can’t navigate 
in four- and five-D.” 

“We don’t have to,” said Cathy 
suddenly. “We’re moving along the 
fourth and fifth axes now, though 
we can’t detect it — and along our 
first and third — and that’s doing 
the trip the hard way. If there is a 



62 



GALAXY 




snori-cui u lies aiong our lateral 
axis.” 

“Good girl,” said McKay with 
the utmost respect. “Cathy, from 
now on you can come on any mis- 
sion you want.” 

“What are you proposing to 
do?” asked Slazeck. “Fly out from 
the water?” 

“Fly out from the water as far as 
we can go — sideways from here, 
not upward, Dev. When we hit the 
inner convolutions of this some 
weird things will happen, though. 
Does anyone think we should fly 
through the long way after all?” 

“Frankly, no,” said Devlin. “We 
have no way of calculating just how 
long that long way will be. It might 
literally take years.” 

“Okay,” said McKay. “Every- 
body stay strapped in — we’ll make 
a run for it.” He banked away from 
the stupendous cascade, out into 
the mist. Now they were com- 
pletely isolated. The gray light 
came from above, below and all 
sides. Only the instruments guided 
him — and as he watched, the 
inertial guidance reported a simul- 
taneous 360-degree turn in all 
axes. 

H E KEPT the controls central- 
ized. “We just passed the first 
bend in the course,” he said. 
“We’ve found a short-cut in one of 
this thing’s dimensions, all right.” 
“There goes another one,” said 
Slazeck. “Look out — ” 



ivAcivay oanKeu away irom me 
curved wall of water looming out of 
the mist. “How did that happen?” 
“The radius of the warp is di- 
minishing as we go along it,” snap- 
ped Slazeck, inspired. “It’ll hap- 
pen again. Keep turning away from 
the water.” 

McKay obeyed as the guidance 
toppled again and radar showed 
water ahead once more. Through 
the mist he caught a glimpse of 
it — this time the curvature was ob- 
vious. 

“I think I’ve got it now,” Sla- 
zeck went on. “This thing is ana- 
logous to a corkscrew in shape but 
five-dimensional — with us inside 
the screw. If we’d continued our 
original course we’d have flown all 
the way down the screw, spiraling 
inside it two ways as we went 
around and around the fourth- and 
fifth-D periphery. The ‘walls’ 
would have curved gradually as the 
screw shrank — but instead we’re 
now cutting across the turns of the 
screw. As the radius narrows your 
straight course keeps taking you 
back to the side.” 

“We’re approaching it at a les- 
ser angle each time,” said McKay, 
banking again. 

“Right. When we pass the mid- 
point our course will seem parallel 
to the water, I believe.” 

“And then the screw will widen 
again?” 

“I sure hope so.” 

“How narrow is it going to get?” 



FALLING THROUGH THE WORLD 



63 




Very narrow indeed, it became 
obvious as the inertial guidance 
toppled again and again. Now 
they could see the racing water all 
round them becoming a tunnel in 
the mist. McKay went on correct- 
ing course until they were flying 
straight along the center of the 
tunnel. 

“Artificial horizon’s level 
again,” he reported. “Why aren’t 
we gaining airspeed? Relative to 
the water we’re diving vertically.” 

“Because we’re on the central 
axis of the warp and near the mid- 
point. Gravity acts radially out- 
ward here, equally in all directions. 
The water out on the periphery is 
following gravity in directions one, 
three, four and five and we’re fly- 
ing down the weightless axis of 

tWQ.” 

“That water, though it looks to 
our senses to be falling straight, is 
making an elaborate spiral rel- 
ative to our course?” 

“Right. We’re still flying at 
right-angles to it, though you can’t 
detect that any more.” 

“The spiral is still contracting, 
Walt. The periphery’s moving in on 
us — ” 

“You can never get a submarine 
when you want one,” said Cathy. 
She seemed to be coming to terms 
with the situation. 

“I think we’ll be okay,” said Sla- 
zeck. “The gravity field is going to 
hold the water to the sides of the 
tube.” 



“That won’t help us if the clear 
space is narrower than our wing- 
span!” 

“I don’t think that will happen. 
The narrowing seems to have stop- 
ped, in fact.” 

“So I see. But the guidance top- 
pling is becoming continuous.” 
McKay has now shut off the gyros 
but the laser unit was still oper- 
ational. As he watched, the artifi- 
cial horizon began to drift. 

“How does that grab you, Walt? 
According to that we’re starting to 
spin.” ! 

“I think,” Slazeck said slowly, 
“that although the three-D radius 
of this tunnel has stopped shrink- 
ing, its radius of curvature in one of 
the extra dimensions is still di- 
minishing.” 

“How serious is that going to 
be?” 

“It shouldn’t hurt us at all, even 
if it rolls up the ship like a ciga- 
rette. We won’t be able to detect 
the change.” 

“1 can detect a change,” said 
Cathy. “The light’s fading.” 

“It’s being red-shifted,” McKay 

discovered, wondering where his 

own panic level was. “This three-D 

tube is so tightly wrapped around 

itself now that visible light hasn’t 

the energy to cross it!” 

% 

R ADAR contact with the water 
failed. As they watched, the vi- 
sual input to the ship’s sensors 
dropped steadily into the infrared. 



64 



GALAXY 




“We're going to get that back on 
the radar frequency before long," 
said McKay. “Until we do we’ll be 
on dead-reckoning. All I can do is 
keep the controls centralized and 
pray we don’t drift off-center.” 

“An interesting question,” said 
Slazeck. “How far can space be 
warped before its fabric gives 
way?” 

“There must be some minimum 
radius of curvature below which 
matter disrupts,” McKay agreed. 
“Since the relay made it through 
here, 1 assume we won’t be wound 
up as tightly as that — ” 

Suddenly Devlin yelled. 

“Dev! What’s the matter?” 

“Stay plugged in,” Devlin said, 
very rapidly. “Don’t anybody use 
his own vision. The ship’s percep- 
tions aren’t affected by the radius 
contraction but ours are — hor- 
ribly.” 

“Why?” 

“The visual field the computer 
gives us is derived from structural 
relationships,” said Slazeck. 
“Though space is curving un- 
believably it’s still showing the 
wings as straight. They’d still look 
straight to Dev’s eyes if seeing 
didn’t depend on light images — but 
the retina must catch multiple im- 
ages of everything now.” 

“I’m still plugged in but I’m feel- 
ing dizzy,” Cathy complained. 

“You’re right,” said McKay. 
“We’re building up inertial effects 
from the spinning space is doing 



around us. I’m closing the accel- 
eration shields now.” 

“The ship is being left behind by 
the rotation of three-D space in the 
other two dimensions,” said Sla- 
zeck. 

“I’m not surprised,” said Mc- 
Kay, fighting an insane desire to 
laugh. “According to the compu- 
ter our wingtips are moving at near 
the speed of light!” 

The energy blackout was creep- 
ing down the wings. “For the sake 
of sanity,” McKay ordered, “stay 
on the instrument display. Even the 
computer can’t make visual sense 
much longer.” 

“I wonder if there’s a minimum 
radius for perception of any kind,” 
said Slazeck gravely. “Will we 
twist so far that we can’t even form 
mental images?” 

“We must remain calm,” said 
McKay. “Even if we get to com- 
plete sensory deprivation the ship is 
still here around us and unless we 
hit the side of the tube space will 
start to straighten out again.” 

“A ghost ship,” said Cathy. 
“Not even a ghost, just an intellec- 
tual construct.” 

“Hang on to that construct,” 
said McKay. “We can still think in 
the abstract even if we can’t form 
mental pictures.” 

A LONG pause followed. There 
was no visual input at all from 
the ship’s sensors now but the in- 



FALLING THROUGH THE WORLD

strument display remained effec- 
tive. Nothing happened to talk 
about. 

McKay thought, If we touch that 
water, which in the extra* 
dimensions must be too close to us 
to measure, we wont even feel the 
end at this speed. Perhaps we al- 
ready have — 4 'Why this is Hell, 
nor am I out of it . .” 

“It’s lifting a bit ,' 1 Devlin re- 
ported. “We’ve got the fuselage 
back.” 

It was true. Though the image 
was very dim and the wings still 
faded into nothing, the computer 
was able to form the image of the 
hull again. Gradually the image 
brightened, grew wider, came back 
into the visible spectrum. 

“We’re through,” said McKay. 
“From here it’s downhill all the 
way.” 

“Visibly uphill, gravitationally 
down, like that crazy hillside in 
Scotland,” said Slazeck. “You 
shouldn’t have to worry about hit- 
ting the sides now your straight 
course is still along the axis of the 
warp.” 

“Right,” said McKay. The 
curved wall of death had receded 
from them on all sides and they 
were isolated in the mist again. As 
predicted, to maintain airspeed 
McKay now had to fly nose-down 
by the artificial horizon. 

“When we reach the periphery 
we’ll see it as a sheer waterfall 
again,” he realized aloud. “It’ll be 



dead ahead of us and I’ll have to 
pull up fast.” 

“Down,” said Slazeck. “Down 
for the love of God. If you pull up 
we’ll stall and hit the water for 
sure.” 

“That’s crazy! We’re trying to 
fly up out of this thing, from the 
sea into the sky — ” 

“But gravity, as channeled 
through this space we’re in, will be 
upside-down with respect to real 
space until we cross the Inter- 
face.” 

“That can’t be right!” ex- 
claimed McKay. “Surely gravity 
can’t turn back on itself — ” 

“Think of it as falling through 
the world, Mac. We’ll come back 
to the ocean’s surface and we’ll 
dive out into the sky, not climb. 
Take my word — look at the 
radar.” 

Before them, blocking their way 
as the mists parted, was the fa- 
miliar, terrifying wall of water. It 
was, of course, falling “down” in 
relation to the ship, in relation to 
gravity and aerodynamic lift. 
But which way was that in relation 
to the Earth’s surface? Surely the 
ship had to climb past the cascade 
and over the rim. 

“Up,” he said firmly. 

“Down, Mac, believe me.” Even 
this couldn’t shake Slazeck. 

McKay banked before they 
reached the wall, out into the mist 
again. He primed the rocket motor 
as they turned — and at the last mo- 



66

,‘T 



ment, visualizing how the break- 
out would look from outside, he 
had serious doubts. Water 
couldn’t fall into the warp at both 
ends — the light was brightening 
around them as the sea parted 
somewhere to let them go. 

“Down it is, Walt,” he said and 
fired the fusion motor. 

The instruments and everything 
else went crazy. What for a mo- 
ment was a power dive became a 
vertical climb out of a pit in the 
ocean which was filling with 
appalling speed. The waters rushed 
together on the dazzling exhaust 
as the RLV leaped into the 
storm-filled sky. 

Vision was lost for a moment as 
they tore through the clouds and 
came back with the full force of 
brilliant sunlight. The rocket as- 
cent continued at maximum ac- 
celeration. 

“Good grief,’’ said Slazeck, 
making a navigational check. “The 
Pacific, this time.” 



“I won’t begin to feel safe until 
we leave the atmosphere,” said 
McKay. “Get me an escape trajec- 
tory, retrograde in the Ecliptic.” 
“What are you going to do, 
Mac?” Cathy asked. 

“Since we can’t get rid of this re- 
lay using Interface, I’m using the 
ship as a slingshot to launch it to- 
ward the sun. If we have enough 
fuel I’ll give it a collision course. 
Then we can separate eighty miles 
from the thing and come back via 
Interface ourselves.” 

The sky darkened as they burned 
up through the stratosphere. “Sec- 
ondary boost, five-second warn- 
ing,” said McKay. 

“Well, I guess we’re the first 
guys in history to fly through the 
Maelstrom,” said Devlin, relaxing. 

“It’s easier that way,” Cathy 
threw in. “Our hair hasn’t turned 
white.” 

“It has on the inside,” said Mc- 
Kay, watching the Earth retreat be- 
low. ★

JAMES E. GUNN 





The Message was the same for all, 
yet each man read it his own way . 




fJIHE audience waited. 

*Every seat in the domed stadium 
was filled and the aisles were 
clogged with people sitting and 
standing. The people were of all 
kinds: old, middle-aged, young, 
children, infants; men and wom- 
en; rich and poor; black, brown, 
red, yellow and pink; clothed for 
work, street or party. They waited 
for the Message to begin. 

Missing from the audience were 
the criers, the coughers, the whis- 
perers, the talkers, the catcallers, 
the whistlers, the feet stompers. 
And the minimal noises of more 
than one hundred thousand per- 
sons, the shuffling and shifting, 
were muffled by the distant 
thunder of air-conditioning units 
trying to cope with body heat and 
exhalations and a Texas summer. 

The bodies were packed 
together, shoulder to shoulder, 
knee to back. The sensation was 
not unpleasant. It was, in fact, a 
kind of sensual communication, as 
if the fleshy contact formed a 
circuit linking each member of the 
audience to the rest like batteries 
in series. All were waiting for 
something to happen, waiting for 
some switch to be thrown that 
would put all the latent power to 
work digging rivers, moving moun- 
tains, destroying evil. 

At least one person did not share 
the general mood. Mitchell pulled 
away from the shoulder pressing 
him on the left and asked, “Are 



you sure you want to go through 
with this?’’ 

Thomas looked at MacDonald. 
MacDonald raised one hand in 
deprecation and shook his head. 

The three men were sitting in the 
top row of the stadium. The floor 
was far below. It was packed with 
ranks of portable chairs; all of 
them were filled. The only empty 
space in the vast arena was the 
square in the middle. Over the 
intervening heads stretching from 
the foreground almost to infinity, 
the distant square looked very 
small. 

Mitchell pulled away again with 
a barely controlled twitch of 
aversion and persisted, “Eve seen 
these things get out of control.” 

In front of them people turned 
and frowned; others, farther away, 
looked around to locate the source 
of the voices. 

MacDonald shook his head 
quickly. 

“It’s not too late to go back to 
the booth,” Mitchell said. “With 
the closed-circuit television and 
all, we’d have a much better view 
and a much better idea of what’s 
going on.” He turned to Thomas. 
“Tell him, George.” 

Thomas raised his shoulders and 
hands helplessly. 

MacDonald touched a finger to 
his lips. “It will be all right, Bill,” 
he said softly. “It’s not enough just 
to see it and hear itr. You’ve got to 
feel it.” 



70 



GALAXY 




“I feel it,” Mitchell muttered. 

More faces were turning in their 
direction. Mitchell made an 
obscene gesture at them with his 
finger. 

Thomas leaned toward Mit- 
chell’s ear. ‘The difference be- 
tween you and Mac,” he said 
softly, “is that you dislike people 
and you hate situations you can’t 
control. There are many like that 
in our business.” 

“People!” Mitchell muttered. 




T HE lights in the stadium went 
out as if the hand of God had 
opened and let night fall over them 
instead of trickling through His 
fingers. In the darkness the roof 
seemed about to drop in and the 
sense of closeness seemed to grow 
as though the audience were 
swelling to fill the entire space. 

Mitchell controlled a rush of 
panic. He breathed deeply. “Damn 
him,” he said. “He can’t do this.” 
But there were no screams, no 
scufflings, only the hushed expec- 
tancy of people waiting for a 
miracle to be performed. 

And a single, powerful shaft of 
light descended from the top of the 
dome, split the darkness, created a 
white circle in the center of the 
stadium floor. 

In the center of the circle stood a 
single figure. In the entire stadium 
only that figure was visible. 



Everyone stared at it, could not 
help but stare. 

Only the part of the audience in 
the portable chairs close to the cir- 
cle could be sure of what the figure 
was. From where Mitchell sat, it 
resembled the kind of stick draw- 
ing of a person a child might make. 

The merest impression came to 
him — of white and flesh-pink and 
black, of thin, of tall, of arms held 
up, outstretched to encompass 
the audience as the figure turned — 
an audience that could not be seen 
or heard in the darkness. 

Slowly, however, the impression 
of listeners returned, only this 
time they were one entity, one 
living thing; the fleshy circuit that 
had connected the individual 
members earlier had now grown 
solid. The audience waited for the 
message. 

The Figure stood alone in the 
embracing circle of light. 1 1 and the 
light were all. No microphone, no 
platform, no table or chairs were in 
evidence, only the lonely Figure 
amid a silent audience of tens on 
tens of thousands. 

“Speak, damn it, speak,” 
Mitchell muttered, but he knew 
the man in the circle would wait, 
draw out the moment into a Fine, 
glittering wire of expectation just 
about to break. The old bastard 
knew what he was doing. 

The audience seemed to hold its 
breath. 

The Figure spoke and the voice, 

71 



THE MESSAGE 




magically, filled the dome stadium 
like the voice of God, coming from 
nowhere, coming from every- 
where. The voice moved the 
audience, shook it, reunited it. 
The voice reinforced the linkages, 
stepped up the power. 

The voice spoke and its sound 
was wisdom; it was truth. 

“We are alone/’ 

The audience moaned an anti- 
phonal response. 

“That is the Message,” the voice 
said. “The Message is from God. 

“They say to you that the Mes- 
sage is from another world like 
ours, from people like us. But they 
do not know. They have heard the 
voice of God and they do not un- 
derstand. They try to read it with 
their minds; they cannot do it. 
They must read it with their hearts. 
They must have faith. 

“The Message is from God and 
it is carried by the angels who are 
the messengers of God. How can a 
Message come from someone 
else?” 

The audience waited for an 
answer it knew would come. 

“There is no one else but man 
and God. We are alone with God in 
the universe. That is the way it is. 
That is the way it was meant to 
be.” 

The words rippled the audience 
like a wind blowing across a valley 
of wheat. 

“Why should we be afraid?” the 
voice asked. “Why should we 

72 



refuse to recognize the truth when 
it is laid before us? God created 
the universe for His glory. God 
created man to wonder at the 
magnificence of the universe and 
to glorify God.” 

The audience took a deep breath. 

“This is the meaning of the 
Message — of man’s words re- 
turned to him, of his frivolity 
shown him as in a mirror — there 
are no others; we are alone . .” 

The words continued to come, 
unbidden, uncompelled, like a 
great natural phenomenon, like 
revelation. The force built up 
within the audience as if they were 
magnets being aligned until each 
field reinforced the next and the 
total field exerted by more than 
one hundred thousand persons 
thinking and feeling as one entity 
was great enough to pervade the 
entire city, to encompass the 
world, and even, perhaps, to shift 
the stars themselves .

T HEY walked down the empty 
corridor underneath the sta- 
dium, their footsteps echoing 
from concrete walls and floor and 
ceiling, little puffs of dust and 
powdered concrete rising as their 
shoes fell. Dimly lighted by occa- 
sional ceiling bulbs, the corridor 
seemed to go on forever. 



GALAXY 




“Well?” Thomas said and 
cringed from the reverberations. 
“Speak of ‘man’s words returned 
to him,’ ” he said. 

“Bastard!” Mitchell said. 

“ "On doit se regarde r soi- 
meme un fort long temps / ” 
MacDonald said, “ ‘ avant que de 
songer a condemner les gens ' ” 
“What did he say?” Mitchell 
asked Thomas. 

“That’s a quotation from 
Moliere’s Misanthrope about not 
judging others until you’ve taken 
a good long look at yourself,” 
Thomas said. 

Mitchell shrugged. “I’ve taken a 
good long look at him,” he said. 

“Are you sure this is the way?” 
MacDonald asked. 

“This is what Judith told me,” 
Mitchell said. 

The corridor broadened into a 
room. Giant pistons supported the 
ceiling like so many hydraulic 
lifts. In the middle was a metal 
cage. Inside the cage were control 
panels with levers and vernier 
rheostats and large buttons paint- 
ed red and green. The cage was 
locked and so were each of the 
controls. 

The room was deserted; only 
their footsteps, pausing now, dis- 
turbed its silence. 

“The magic,” MacDonald said 
appreciatively. 

“The son of a bitch,” Mitchell 
said. “I think it’s this way.” 

He led them past the control 



room and down another corridor 
to a door painted gray. He 
knocked lightly. When there was 
no response he knocked harder. 

The door opened a crack. 
“Judith?” he said. 

“Bill?” The door opened wider. 
A girl slipped into the corridor 
and gave Mitchell her hand. 

She was small and slender with 
dark hair and large dark eyes seem- 
ingly all pupil. She was not excep- 
tionally pretty, Mitchell thought in 
his more rational moments; per- 
haps it was the impact on him of 
the large pupils. He could be 
objective about the matter and yet 
feel an attraction to her that made 
her appear unique in all the world 
and therefore beautiful. 

He squeezed her hand in place of 
a kiss. She disliked a public 
display of affection. Her Puritan 
upbringing, he had called it when 
they were first going together as 
undergraduates. 

“Is the old bastard in there?” he 
asked. 

“Bill !” she protested but with- 
out heat. “He is my father. And 
he’s inside, resting. He’s not well, 
you know. Sermons take a great 
deal of his strength.” 

“This is Mr. MacDonald,” 
Mitchell said. “He’s in charge of 
the Project.” 

“Golly!” Judith said. “I’m hon- 
ored.” She really seemed im- 
pressed. 

“And this is Mr. Thomas,” 



THE MESSAGE 



73 




Mitchell continued. “He’s my 
boss.” 

“It’s a collaboration,” Thomas 
said. 

“Judith Jones,” Mitchell said. 
“My fiancee.” 

“Now, Bill,” she said, “that’s 
not strictly true.” 

They were talking in hushed 
voices like conspirators, and the 
reverberations in the corridor 
made the voices even stranger. 
Mitchell had an eerie sense of play- 
ing a part in a play in which the 
characters tried to communicate 
through endless, echoing caverns. 

“Does your father know we're 
coming to see him?” MacDonald 
asked. 

Judith shook her head. "He 
wouldn’t still be here if he knew. 
He doesn’t like to meet people. 
He doesn’t like people who want 
things, who want him to do things, 
who want to argue with him. He 
doesn’t have time, he says, but 
mainly he doesn’t like it.” 

“Are we just going to break in 
on him?” MacDonald asked. 

Judith frowned as if she were 
bracing herself for something 
unpleasant. “I’ll introduce you. 
Try not to disturb him — too 
much.” She turned toward the 
door and then turned back. “And 
try not to mind that he seems rude. 
He really isn’t. He protects him- 
self.” 

She opened the door and slid 
back into the room, leaving the 

74 



door ajar behind her. “Father,” 
Mitchell heard her say, “some men 
are here to see you.” 




J UDITH opened the door quick- 
ly before her father could speak. 
“This is Mr. MacDonald,” she 
said. “He’s in charge of the Pro- 
ject. And Mr. Thomas. He works 
with Bill Mitchell. And you know 
Bill.” 

The man was sitting in an old 
metal chair beside an old makeup 
table and mirror. The furnishings 
were from another era. The man 
seemed as old as they were, old 
enough to be MacDonald's father 
instead of Judith’s. His hair was 
pure white and his face was lined. 
His eyes, as dark as Judith's, 
blazed up as the men entered - 
then the fire was gone, as if a door 
had been shut to hide it. The man 
looked down. 

“I know Mitchell,” the voice 
said. It was a tired voice, an old 
voice, a ghost of the voice that had 
Filled the stadium above. “I know 
him as a foul-mouthed blasphemer, 
an atheist who scoffs at the beliefs 
of others, a lecher with the morals 

GALAXY 




of a monkey. I know, too, that I 
told you not to see him again. Nor 
do I wish to see these others.” 

“Mr. Jones — ” MacDonald 

began. 

“Get out,” the old man said. 

“We are both older men, Mr. 
Jones,” MacDonald began. 
“Jeremiah,” the old man said. 
“Mr. Jeremiah — ” 

“Just Jeremiah. And Jeremiah 
does not talk to atheists.” 

“1 am a scientist — ” 

“An atheist.” 

“I want to talk to you about the 
Message.” 

“I have heard the Message.” 
“Directly?” 

Jeremiah placed one long, 
translucent hand on each bony 
knee and leaned toward MacDon- 
ald, looking up. “I have heard it 
from God,” he said harshly. 
“Have you heard it more directly 
than that?” 

“Did you hear it before the 
Project picked it up or afterward?” 
Jeremiah sat back and sighed. 
“Goodbye, Mr. MacDonald. You 
wish to trap me — ” 

“To talk with you — ” 

“The Message I speak of is not 
your Message, which comes in rid- 
dles over waves. The Message — 
my Message — is from God and it 
tells me about yours. Is your 
Message from God?” 

“It may be,” MacDonald said. 
Jeremiah was about to turn his 
back upon them, but he stopped 



and looked at MacDonald. So did 
Mitchell. 

“I do not know from whom it 
is,” MacDonald said, “so it may 
be from God.” 

“But you do not think so,” 
Jeremiah said. 

“I do not think so,” MacDonald 
said. “But I do not know. I have 
not had a revelation like yours. My 
mind is not closed — is yours?” 

“A mind is not closed which is 
open to truth but not to false-, 
hood,” Jeremiah said. “You have 
not read your Message, then?” 

“No,” MacDonald admitted. 
“But we will.” 

“When you do,” Jeremiah said, 
dismissing them, “then come talk 
to me if you must.” 

“If — when — we do read it, if I 
send for you, will you come?” 

Jeremiah’s dark eyes looked in- 
to MacDonald’s. “Before it is an- 
nounced to the rest of the world?” 

“Yes.” 

“I will come.” A pale hand came 
up to support a head that drooped 
to meet it. When the others did not 
move, Jeremiah looked up. “What 
do you want of me?” he asked 
wearily. 

“Your public meetings are 
stirring people up against the 
Project,” MacDonald said. 

The banked fires flickered. “I 
am speaking the truth.” 

“Your truth is creating an 
atmosphere in which people may 
shut down the Project, keep us 



THE MESSAGE 



75 




from deciphering the Message, 
prevent us from listening for 
others/’ 

“I speak truth,” Jeremiah said. 
“We are alone. Nothing can 
change that. What happens when 
people know the truth is as God 
wills.” 

“But if the Message is from 
God and meant for all of us, not 
just to you alone should we not 
read it? And hear more?” 

Jeremiah’s long face grew 
longer. “The Message may be from 
Satan.” 

“In your sermon you said it was 
from God.” 

“That is true,” Jeremiah said. 
“But Satan can deceive even those 
who listen to God.” A translucent 
hand stroked a pale chin in 
thought. “I could be mistaken,”^ 
he said. 

M acdonald took half a step 
toward Jeremiah, starting a 
gesture that he stopped in mid-air. 
“If you change your interpretation 
now, it would only confuse the 
faithful. Give us a chance to 
decipher the Message. I don’t ask 
you to stop telling the truth as you 
see it, but at least do not incite 
your followers against the Pro- 
ject.” 

Jeremiah looked at MacDon- 
ald’s hand until it dropped to his 
side. “What do you hope to de- 
cipher? The voices?” 

“The voices from the Thirties?” 



MacDonald said and shook his 
head. “Those bits and snatches of 
the radio shows of that time, re- 
broadcast to us from the direction 
of Capella, are just the wave of 
the hand, the attention getter.” 
“Then what is the Message?” 
“We’re not absolutely sure. We 
think it’s in the bursts of static be- 
tween the voices. Slowed down, 
filtered for noise, for real static, it 
can sound like a real communica- 
tion — dots and silence, dots and 
silence.” 

Jeremiah looked skeptical. “You 
could read anything you wished 
into dots and silence.” 

“We haven’t. Not yet. But we’re 
trying to read it right. The 
computers are working on it, trying 
to make some intelligent pattern 
out of it. We’ll get it done. It just 
takes time. That’s what we need — 
time.” 

Jeremiah said, “I can’t promise 
anything.” 

“We’ll let you know first.” 

“I can’t promise anything,” 
Jeremiah said again, but this time 
it was like a promise. “Now leave 
me alone. And, Judith — you must 
not see this man again.” He mo- 
tioned toward Mitchell. “I have 
told you so before, but I tell you 
now. You must choose between 
us. If you choose him, if you 
choose to disobey me, then I will 
not see you again.” 

“Damn it — ” Mitchell began. 
Judith stopped him. “Go on. 



76

Bill,” she said. She stepped out- 
side the door with them. “I’m not 
going to see you again, Bill, not 
alone.” 

“I need you,” Mitchell said. 
“We made plans — ” 

“He needs me,” Judith said. 
“He’s old. He’s not well. He’s not 
good with people.” She went back 
inside. 

“What a strange mixture of a 
man,” Thomas said." “He can 
make thousands believe he speaks 
with God and he can’t talk to 
another human being without 
trying to push him away, without 
rejecting the communication.” 
“You should try to understand 
him, Bill,” MacDonald said gently. 
“He’s asking for understanding in 
his way. He’s asking for help. And 
you two are a lot alike.” 

“Damn him,” Mitchell 
muttered, his soul filled with dis- 
gust for the human race. “Damn 
everybody!” He looked around. 
“Well, nearly everybody,” he said. 




T HE taxi rolled silently through 
the traffic toward the airport. 
Seated between Thomas and 
Mitchell, MacDonald said, 
“ Y ou’ ve done a good job.” 

“Hah!” Thomas said. 
MacDonald raised a hand to 
emphasize his sincerity. “I mean it. 
You and Bill and the others, with 
your articles and releases and 
interviews and programs and all 
the other techniques of communi- 
cation, by now have won popular 
acceptance for the Project. No, not 
just acceptance — enthusiasm. The 
news that we have received a 
message from intelligent beings 
who live on a planet which 
probably circles one of the twin 
suns of Capelja has been received 
without skepticism — with excite- 
ment but no panic. I don’t know 
how it could have been done any 
better.” 

“I do,” Mitchell said. 

“You’re setting your goals too 
high,” MacDonald said. “After 
all, for fifty years nine persons out 
of ten had never heard of the 
Project and those who had mostly 
thought it was a waste of time and 
effort. And for more than fifty 
years experts have predicted that 
people would become hysterical 
when they were presented with 
proof of the existence of other 
intelligent creatures in the uni- 
verse.” 

“Experts!” Thomas said. 
MacDonald shook his head and

chuckled. “All right, gentlemen, 
accept credit for bringing back 
radio .’ 1 He leaned forward and 
twisted a knob until it clicked. 

Music filled the taxi, first some 
of the current folk revival, then 
dance music from the Thirties. 
After a moment that faded and the 
sound that came back up was filled 
with static and broken trans- 
missions .... Mitchell reached to 
turn it off. 

“Some accomplishment,’’ he 
said. 

Thomas stopped his hand. 
“Wait!” 

“CRACKLE,” came over the 
radio. “Say good night grace POP-

“That’s it, isn’t it?” Mitchell 
said. “The Message itself.” He 
found a strange kind of conviction 
in the poor quality of the reception. 

“Part of it,” Thomas said. 

His voice was a little shaken, 
Mitchell thought, as if Thomas 
were reliving that moment in 
Puerto Rico when he had heard it 
first. He had changed, then, from a 



skeptic to a dedicated Project 
partisan. His self-assigned mis- 
sion was to convince a great variety 
of publics that the Message was 
real, good, not be feared. His 
friends had not credited the change 
in Thomas, not at first, but then 
they too had listened to the Mes- 
sage and to George and had agreed 
to help. Mitchell had joined in the 
first month. 

“Those are the sounds of yes- 
terday and today,” the radio 
announcer said. “Those are the 
sounds of the stars. That is part of 
the Message being received from 
Capella, forty-five light-years away 
from Earth. If you have any 
suggestions for deciphering the 
Message, send them to Robert 
MacDonald, Project, Arecibo, 
Puerto Rico. And now — another 
episode from a story begun ninety 
years ago . .” 

The voice faded and eerie music 
came up, modulated, and a deep 
voice asked, “Who knows what evil 
lurks in the hearts of men?” The 
music came back up and faded. 
“The Shadow knows 

Thomas twisted the knob until 
it clicked. 

“A brilliant idea,” MacDonald 
said, “but I don’t know how we are 
going to answer all the mail.” 

“Any worthwhile suggestions?” 
MacDonald shook his head. 
“Not yet. But who knows what 
brilliance lurks in the minds of 
men?”

“Well,” Thomas said, “we 
didn’t expect any. Tell you 
what — we’ll send somebody down 
to draft some standard replies, set 
them up on your computer.’’ 
“Good,’’ MacDonald said. 
“What are you going to do about 
the Chinese?” Thomas asked. 
“They've called the Message a 
capitalist plot to distract the world 
from American imperialism. May- 
be we should have informed them 
before the public announcement.” 
MacDonald shrugged. “Don’t 
worry about it. Their scientists 
have requested tapes.” 

“The Russians have announced 
that they picked up the Message a 
year ago,” Mitchell said. 

“They haven’t asked for tapes,” 
MacDonald said. “They’re prob- 
ably picking it up for themselves 
now that they know where to 
search.” 

Thomas sighed. “I’m afraid 
we’re just creating more trouble for 
you.” 

MacDonald smiled. “‘Law, 
Brer Tarrypin!’ sez Brer Fox, se- 
zee, ‘you ain’t see no trouble yit. 
Ef you wanter see sho’ nuff trou- 
ble, you des oughter go ‘longer 
me; I’m de man w'at kin show 
you trouble,’ sezee.” 

The taxi pulled up at the airport 
and MacDonald retrieved his 
credit card from the meter as he 
got out. 

“Come with me to the gift 
counter,” he called over his 



shoulder to the others. “1 want to 
pick up something for Maria and 
Bobby.” When they drew abreast 
of him as he walked across the vast 
expanse of imitation marble, he 
said, “I’ve switched your reserva- 
tions. I want you to return to 
Arecibo with me.” 

The floor vibrated as the electric 
catapult launched another jet. A 
moment later came a low whoosh 
and a fading thunder. 

“I’ve got things here I should 
take care of before I leave,” 
Mitchell said. 

“For the sake of the Project,” 
M acDonald said, “I think you 
should stay away from Judith for a 
while.” 

“You and Jeremiah,” Mitchell 
said. 

“He’s a prophet, all right,” 
Thomas said gloomily. “And a 
danger.” 

“That’s why I want you to come 
back with me,” MacDonald said. 
“I want you to get the feel of the 
Project again, the reality, the ex- 
citement of the impending break- 
through. If you can communicate 
this, it might counteract the grow- 
ing influence of Jeremiah and his 
followers.” 

Thomas shook his head. “We 
won’t counteract Jeremiah. He’s 
an honest man possessed by a 
vision, like a poet. He has his own 
reality.” 

“He’s an old bastard,” Mitchell 
said. 



THE MESSAGE 



79 




"‘He’s a man whose basic beliefs 

have been severely threatened,” 

MacDonald said, “and he reacts 

by defending his world. The Soli- 

tarians cannot coexist with the 

fact of intelligent life on other 

worlds.” 

» 

“Then why did you invite him to 
the Project?” Mitchell asked. 

“Because he is an honest man as 
well as a fanatic,” MacDonald 
said. “I think we have an even 
chance, or a little less, that if he 
sees what we are doing, sees the 
translation, he will accept it and 
be able to change.” 

“Or he will reject it or be 
destroyed,” Thomas said. 

“Yes, ” M acDonald admitted. 
“Those are the possibilities.” 

“How serious is his threat to the 
Project?” Mitchell asked. 

“The most serious since its 
founding,” MacDonald said. 
“How ironic — and somehow 
peculiarly appropriate to the 
history of the Project — that its 
most critical moment should come 
at the time it accomplished what it 
was created to do! Fifty years 
without results and no challengs, 
but the moment we received a 
communication our existence was 
threatened.” 

Thomas laughed. “Scientists are 
dangerous. They bought you off 
with toys, but when the toys turned 

out to be real they began to wor- 

■» 

ry- 

“What can the Solitarians do?” 



Mitchell asked. “Besides talk 
among themselves.” 

“They're big,” MacDonald 
said, “and they're growing. “They 
want the Project stopped and 
they’re putting pressure on Sena- 
tors and Congressmen. In spite 
of your good work, in spite of 
what I’ve called public acceptance, 
they still manage to exploit man- 
kind’s basic fear of meeting a su- 
perior. And there’s no doubt that 
the Capellans are superior.” 

“How so?” Mitchell asked, and 
as he heard the words he felt that 
his tone was a little sharper than he 
had intended. 

The floor shook again. The gift 
counter was just ahead. MacDon- 
ald already was running his gaze 
along the shelves. 

“They’re clearly older and more 
capable than we,” MacDonald 
said. “Their giant red suns are 
older than our sun by millions — 
perhaps billions — of years, de- 
pending, say my astronomers, on 
the effect of mass on stellar evo- 
lution. In any case, we have not 
even been able to pick up radio 
broadcasts from other worlds, 
much less rebroadcast them so 
that the original world could re- 
ceive them again.” 

“ ‘Who’s that little chatter- 
box?’ ” Thomas half-sang, half- 
chanted, his gaze distant. “Pepsi- 
Cola hits the spot.” He shivered. 

MacDonald bought a new book, 
a romantic novel about love and

peril in orbit, for his wife. A three- 
dimensional scale model of the 
stars surrounding Earth to a dis- 
tance of fifty light-years — includ- 
ing, of course, Capella — he chose 
for his son. And then, admitting 
that an eight-month-old infant 
would have little use for the mod- 
el, at least for a year or two, he 
picked out for the babe a stuffed 
toy ostrich. It was so big that it 
had to go into the jet’s baggage 
compartment. 




ttljOBBY!” Maria said in the 
Iw little waiting room of the 
airport just outside Arecibo. She 
was frowning as she tried not to 
laugh at the gigantic bird with the 
long legs that stood in front of her. 
“Hush, now,” she said to the cry- 
ing child in her arms, “it won’t hurt 
you.” And then she said to 
MacDonald, “What a monstrous 
bird to give a baby!” 



Mitchell thought she was the 
most beautiful woman he had ever 
seen. He wondered what she would 
have been like at twenty or even 
thirty. Between Maria and his 
work, MacDonald had two mag- 
nificent reasons for remaining in 
Arecibo as much as possible. 

“I’m a fool,” MacDonald said, 
stricken. “I just can’t seem to 
understand my own family.” 

“Considering,” Thomas said, 
“how well he understands and 
communicates with everybody 
else.” 

“Ah!” MacDonald said de- 
precatingly. “What of Jeremiah?” 

“At least you got him to listen,” 
Thomas said, “and to promise to 
come.” 

Maria’s smile burst upon 
MacDonald. “You did, Robby? 
You won him over?” 

“Nothing as final as that,” 
MacDonald said. “Here, now, let 
me hold him.” 

He held out his arms to the 
squalling boy. The baby went to 
him willingly, trustingly, but not 
looking at the stuffed bird all the 
same. In a moment or two the in- 
fant’s yells turned to sobs and the 
sobs to silence. 

“Now, Bobby,” MacDonald 
said, “you know your father 
wouldn’t bring you anything that 
would hurt you — though, to be 
sure, it might frighten you at first. 
Well, come along,” he said to the 
ostrich, putting his gaze on its

black eyes, enigmatic in their 
plastic sockets, “we will grow up 
to you.” 

He tucked the bird under his 
other arm, turned toward the door 
and stopped. “What am I thinking 
of?” he asked Maria. “These are 
my guests. You know George, our 
own doubting Thomas. And this 
other handsome gentleman is Bill 
Mitchell, who is a star-crossed 
lover.” 

“Hello, George,” Maria said, 
presenting her cheek to be kiss- 
ed. “Hello, Bill,” she said, extend- 
ing her hand. “I hope the stars are 
as kind to you as they have been to 
me. 

“It’s not all that serious,” 
Mitchell said, trying to keep his 
tone light. “You know, a stubborn 
father, a girl who must choose — it 
will all work out.” 

“I know it will,” Maria said, and 
Mitchell was swayed for a mo- 
ment by her conviction. “Come,” 
Maria said, “I will fix you all a 
good Mexican supper.” 

As Maria withdrew her hand 
from his, Mitchell caught a glimpse 
of a white scar that crossed her 
wrist. 

“ Querida ,” MacDonald said 
apologetically, “we ate on the 
plane.” 

“You call that eating?” 

“Besides,” MacDonald said, 
“we are on our way to the Project. 
We’ve still got work to do. To- 
morrow — before these gentlemen 



must fly back to New York — you 
can fix a big dinner. Okay?” 

Partially mollified, she gave him 
a comic shrug and a broad: 
“Hokay.” 

He laughed. 

They put their bags and the os- 
trich into the trunk of MacDon- 
ald’s car. The baby was relieved 
when the stuffed bird disappeared: 
he settled comfortably onto his 
father’s shoulder. Maria drove. 
She handled the car skillfully for 
a woman, Mitchell thought, parti- 
cularly for a beautiful woman. 
The old steam turbine hummed 
peacefully under the hood as they 
climbed the quiet green hills in the 
night. 

It had been a long day that 
started in New York and ended in 
Puerto Rico by way of Texas and 
Florida, and Mitchell should have 
been exhausted. But for him the 
evening was enchanted. He did 
not know why. Perhaps it was the 
Puerto Rican quiet after the urban 
congestion of Texas, perhaps the 
automobile taking them farther 
from civilization, perhaps the 
calm beauty of MacDonald’s wife, 
perhaps their domestic chatter in 
the front seat. Usually this kind of 
thing embarrassed him, this talk 
of food and family in which he 
played the role of an unwilling 
eavesdropper, but somehow this 
was different. 

Maybe , he thought, people are 
not so disgusting .

H E LOOKED at Thomas. Even 
Thomas felt it. This man of 
tangled nerves, one-time poet and 
novelist, sometime muckraking 
reporter, now committed propa- 
gandist for the Project and its 
cause, was staring quietly out a 
window as if he had packaged all 
his worries and mailed them back 
to Manhattan. 

The journey in the moonlight 
went on. Mitchell found himself 
wishing it would never end, this 
trip beyond time and space, but 
then he saw below them a valley 
that gleamed metallic in the night. 
Across the valley some giant 
spider hlad been busy spinning 
cables in a precise mathematical 
pattern; it was a web to catch the 
stars. Beyond it they came upon a 
giant ear cocked to the sky to hear 
the whispers of the night. 

And then the car drifted onto a 
broad parking lot that gleamed 
phosphorescently in the moon- 
light and came to a stop beside a 
long, low concrete building. 
Mitchell blinked. The spell faded. 
It faded slowly. Looking back 
later Mitchell thought that it con- 
tinued to color his impressions 
for as long as he stayed on the is- 
land. 

They left the car. MacDonald 
placed the sleeping child gently in 
the seat and strapped him down. 
He kissed Maria and murmured 
something about his plans. 

Thomas and Mitchell took their 



bags out of the trunk; Mitchell re- 
moved the ostrich. “I’ll keep him 
at the office for a while,” he said, 
“until Bobby gets used to him.” 

The car whispered away. 
MacDonald opened the door to 
the building. 

“Here we are.” 

Thomas stopped in the doorway 
and motioned toward the distant 
steerable telescope, moving slowly 
on its supporting arm. 

“You’re still searching?” 
MacDonald shrugged. “Just be- 
cause we picked up one message 
doesn’t mean there are no others, 
that our search is ended. And we 
have engineers who are good at 
listening but not so good at under- 
standing what they hear — so far, 
of course, none of us have been 
very good at that — and we don’t 
want to lose them, to see the team 
broken up before the game is over. 

They entered the building. The 
corridors were of painted con- 
crete, the floors tiled, all lit by ra- 
diant fixtures. From the cars in the 
parking lot Mitchell had assumed 
the place was busy, but somehow 
he was unprepared for the bustle. 
Men walked purposefully along 
the halls, papers in their hands, 
nodding at MacDonald as if he 
had never been away, or talking 
eagerly to each other, not notic- 
ing MacDonald and the strangers. 
Or women moved past, more soci- 
able, talking to MacDonald, ask- 
ing about his trip, about Maria and

Bobby, being introduced to the 
visitors. 

And then MacDonald had them 
down the hall to an open door. 
“Here’s our listening post,” he 
said to Mitchell, pulling him by 
one arm into the doorway. For 
some reason Mitchell did not 
mind being guided. 



T HE room was filled with elec- 
tronic equipment, a computer, 
recording devices; it smelled of 
ozone. Two men were in the room, 
one at a panel against a wall, tink- 
ering with its wiring, the other sit- 
ting in a chair, earphones over his 
head. He looked up, waved and 
turned one earphone out toward 
MacDonald in a gesture of invita- 
tion. MacDonald waved back and 
shook his head. 

“What’s with the bird?” the lis- 
tener called out. 

MacDonald shook his head 
again. “It’s a long story. I’ll tell 
you later.” He turned back to 
Mitchell. “Any- other time I’d take 
you in and show you what we have 
here. I’d let you listen to the music 
of the spheres, the sound of the in- 
finite, the voices of the damned 
who cannot make themselves 
understood, but right now we 
don’t have time.” 

“Don’t- do it,” Thomas warned 
Mitchell, half-seriously. “You’ll 
never be the same. That’s what 
makes them all so strange.” 



“You want to hear the Mes- 
sage,” MacDonald asked, smil- 
ing. “You want to know why we 
haven’t deciphered it in six 
months of effort. Six months and 
the Solitarians gather their forces, 
Congress grows nervous about 
appropriations and the efforts 
of clever, dedicated communica- 
tors like you and George are in 
danger of being frittered away.” 

Mitchell shook his head. 

“You’re right,” MacDonald 
said. “We haven’t deciphered the 
Message and we should have done 
it by now with all the minds and all 
the computers we’ve had working 
on it. Come on. I’ll show you.” 

They passed other doors, other 
rooms where doors were open and 
men and women worked at desks 
or benches or panels. The com- 
puter room was at the end of the 
corridor. It was called the com- 
puter room apparently, because 
instead of walls it had computers 
and the floor was so filled with 
data-input keyboards and print- 
ers that there was scarcely room 
to walk between them. 

At the keyboard amid the com- 
puters, like a witch surrounded 
by familiars, sat a middle-aged 
man with salt-and-pepper hair cut 
short. 

“Hello, Oley,” MacDonald said. 

“You brought me a present,” the 
other said. 

MacDonald sighed, took the 
ostrich out from under his arm. 



84 



GALAXY 




put it in a distant corner and said, 
“No, Oley, I brought you some 
guests/’ He introduced Mitchell 
to Olsen, his computer expert. 
Thomas had met him before. 

Mitchell looked around at all the 
machines, trying to guess what 
they all did. 

“Any breakthroughs?” Mac- 
Donald asked. 

“We’re lucky we haven’t lost 
ground,” Olsen said. 

“Play your best selection for 
our visitors,” MacDonald said. 

Olsen pressed two keys on his 
keyboard. A visual display ap- 
peared on a window in front of 
him, broken rows of white num- 
bers on a gray background, but 
Mitchell looked at it only for a mo- 
ment. They he was listening to 
sounds that came from concealed 
speakers — a soft hiss, then silence, 
then a noise, silence, more noise. 
Sometimes the noise would be 
loud, sometimes soft, sometimes 
brief, sometimes extended, some- 
times a click, sometimes a buzz or 
a plop. 

M ITCHELL looked at. Thomas 
and they both looked at Mac- 
Donald. “I can get better mes- 
sages from a thunderstorm,” Mit- 
chell said. 

“That’s part of the problem,” 
MacDonald said. “Part of what 
we get between the rebroadcasts 
of our old radio programs is stat- 



ic. Add the effect of distance, of 
interruption, of fading. But part 
of what we pick up, we think, is 
communication. The problem is 
how to distinguish one from the 
other. Tell them what we’re try- 
ing to do, Oley.” 

“First we try to clean up the 
transmission,” Olsen said. “Filter 
out the natural noise electroni- 
cally, I mean. We try to eliminate 
what is clearly casual, then run a 
series of variables on what is 
questionable, hardening up the 
signals, reinforcing them where 
necessary — ” 

“Show them what we get when 
we clean it up,” MacDonald said. 

Olsen pressed two more keys. 
From the speakers came a firm ser- 
ies of sounds and silences, like the 
buzz of an old-fashioned interna- 
tional code without the dashes: a 
dot and another dot, a long si- 
lence — six more dots, a silence — 
seven more dots, silence — dot, si- 
lence — dot . 

They listened, Mitchell and 
Thomas, trying to make sense out 
of it, and finally looked up sheep- 
ishly for there was no way they 
could decipher the message just 
by listening to it. 

“There’s something hypnotic 
about it all the same,” Mitchell 
said. 

“But that’s no better than the 
other,” Thomas said, “and it’s not 
real. This isn’t the way it origin- 
ally sounds.” 



THE MESSAGE 



85 




Olsen shrugged. “The unfilt- 
ered stuff isn't, either. It’s just the 
way our particular speakers in- 
terpret the small packets of energy 
picked up on our radio programs 
of ninety years ago. With the help 
of the computers we have rein- 
terpreted the message in sounds 
that seem more familiar or more 
meaningful." 

“And you still can’t read it," 
Thomas said. 

Olsen nodded. “We’ve still got 
problems. We're trying to find 
duplications, repetitions, pat- 
terns. We don’t know where the 
message starts or where it ends, 
whether it’s one message given 
over and over again or a series of 
messages. Sometimes we think 
we’ve found something; it works 
for a while and then it falls apart." 

“Found what?" Mitchell asked. 
“A statement?" 

“In what language?" Olsen 
asked. 

“Well, mathematics, maybe. 
Like one and one equal two — or 
the Pythagorean theorem or some- 
thing." 

MacDonald smiled. “That 
would be useful for catching our 
attention, for demonstrating that 
it was a message sent by intelli- 
gent beings, but they've done that, 
don’t you see? With the rebroad- 
cast of our radio programs." 

“What kind of message could 
they send that would mean any- 
thing?" Mitchell asked. 



“Sound and silence," Thomas 
mused. “Sound and silence. It 
must mean something." 

“Dots and silence,’’ Mitchell 
said. “That’s what Mac told Jere- 
miah. Dots and silence. That’s 
what it sounds like, too. Dots and 
no dashes. Dots and blanks." 

MacDonald looked quickly at 
Mitchell. “Say that again." 

“Dots and silence. That's what 
you said. To Jeremiah." 

“No," MacDonald said. “What 
you said after that." 

“Dots and no dashes," Mitchell 
repeated. “Dots and blanks." 

“Dots and blanks," MacDonald 
repeated. “Dots and blanks." 

“Dots and blanks," MacDonald 
mused. “What does that remind 
you of, Olsen? A crossword puz- 
zle? Do you suppose — The old 
Drake game?" He turned to Ol- 
sen. “Let’s try it. For all the com- 
binations of prime numbers." 

He turned to Mitchell. “Bill you 
send a message to Jeremiah over 
my signature. Three words. 
‘Come. Message deciphered.’ ’’ 

“Are you so sure you have the 
answer?" Thomas asked. “Can’t 
you wait to make certain?" 

“You’ve felt that confidence 
before," MacDonald’s tone made 
it a question, “the feeling that 
you know you have the answer 
even before you try it out, a kind 
of instant communication?" 

“Yes," Thomas said. “Yes." 

“And I want Jeremiah to be 



86 



GALAXY 




here when we run it off for the first 
time,” MacDonald said. “I think 
that may be very important.” 
Mitchell paused at the door. 
“You aren’t going to try it until 
then?” he asked incredulously. 

MacDonald shook his head 
slowly. 




T HE room already was crowded 
with people when Jeremiah and 
Judith and MacDonald came 
through the door. Thomas was 
there and Olsen and a dozen more 
of MacDonald’s colleagues on 
the Project. 

Mitchell had been surprised 
when Jeremiah’s message ar- 



rived — he had outdone MacDon- 
ald’s brevity by a word, “I 
come — ” and even more surprised 
when Judith’s message arrived 
soon afterward giving the arrival 
time. Mitchell had never known 
Jeremiah to fly, and he had not 
thought the old man would come at 
all. 

The wait for Mac to return 
from the airport with Jeremiah 
had been nearly unendurable for 
Mitchell; how much more diffi- 
cult must it have been for the oth- 
ers who had been working so long 
on the Project? But they were re- 
markably patient. They shifted 
their positions from time to time 
as they waited, but no one moved 
to leave, no one complained, no 
one urged Olsen to give them a 
preview. Perhaps, Mitchell 
thought, they had been selected for 
patience by the long years of the 
Project when they had achieved 
nothing but negatives. Or per- 
haps they were an exceptional 
group of men and women shaped 
into a high-morale group by Mac- 
Donald’s leadership. 

Mitchell did not find himself re- 
pelled by their proximity. He 
found himself liking them in- 
dividually — even collectively. 

Jeremiah entered the room like a 
high priest wrapped in his robes of 
office, aloof, cold, unapproach- 
able. MacDonald tried to intro- 
duce him to the members of his 
staff, but Jeremiah waved him

away. He studied the machinery on 
wall and floor, ignoring the peo- 
ple. 

Judith followed him, nodding at 
the people they passed as if to 
make up for her father's absence 
of humanity. Mitchell's flesh grew 
taut as he saw her again and he 
wondered why it was Judith, why 
it was this one girl among many, 
who made him shiver. 

Jeremiah stopped in front of 
MacDonald, as if they were the 
only two persons in the room, and 
said, “It takes all this to read one 
small Message? For the faithful 
it requires only a believing heart." 

M acdonald smiled. “One 

small difference between us 
makes necessary all the apparatus. 
Our faith requires that all data 
and results can be duplicated by 
anyone using the same equipment 
and techniques. And with all the 
believing hearts in the world, 
none, I think, has received identi- 
cal Messages." 

“It isn’t necessary," Jeremiah 
said. 

“I understand that your com- 
munications are highly personal," 
MacDonald said, “but wouldn’t 
it be wonderful if the important 
Messages could be received by all 
the faithful?" 

Jeremiah looked at MacDonald. 
It seemed to Mitchell that these 
two men were alone in the room 



and that they were battling for 
each other’s souls. He reached out 
and took Judith’s hand. She 
glanced at him and then down at 
their hands and then away, not 
speaking. But she didn’t take her 
hand away and Mitchell thought 
he felt her fingers tighten. 

“You did not bring me here to 
scoff at my faith," Jeremiah said. 

“No," MacDonald said, “to 
show you mine. I, too, have had 
my revelation. I do not compare 
it with yours. It has no identifi- 
able source. It is an inner con- 
viction that has grown from a small 
thought to a large certainty that 
there is other life in the universe, 
that to prove its existence is the 
most gloriously human thing man 
can do, that to communicate with 
it would make this vast, incom- 
prehensible place in which man 
lives, this unexplored forest of the 
night, a friendlier, happier, more 
wonderful, more exciting, holier 
place in which to be." 

Mitchell looked at the other 
faces in the room. They were star- 
ing at MacDonald and Mitchell 
had the feeling that they, too, were 
hearing MacDonald’s credo for 
the first time, that he had lived it 
but never expressed it before. 
Now he was unveiling himself be- 
fore this skeptical stranger as if 
Jeremiah’s belief in him mat- 
tered more than anything else. 
Mitchell’s hand tightened on 
Judith’s.

Jeremiah was frowning. “I did 
not come all this way to argue 
theology,” he said harshly. 

k Tm not arguing,” MacDonald 
said earnestly. “And I’m not deal- 
ing in theology, not the way I see it, 
although I may infringe upon 
those areas you have declared 
sacred to your beliefs. I’m trying 
to explain myself, you see—” 
“Why?” Jeremiah asked. 
“Because it's important to me 
that you understand,” MacDon- 
ald said. “I want you to know that 
I am a man of good will.” 

“Most dangerous of all are men 
of good will,” Jeremiah said, look- 
ing like a prophet in his old- 
fashioned black suit, “For they 
are easily deluded.” 

“I am not easily deluded," 
MacDonald said. 

“You want to believe. You are 
easily deluded. And you will find 
what you wish to find.” 

“No,” MacDonald said, “it can- 
not be that way. I will find what 
anyone can find, whatever his be- 
liefs and desires, what you would 
find if you should look and listen. 
What I am trying to tell you is 
that no matter what my inten- 
tions, my hopes, my fears, my mes- 
sage is not like yours. It can be 
checked. It must read the same to 
everyone, every time, or it is 
wrong and will be discarded.” 
Jeremiah’s lips curled. “You do 
not interpret? You read it directly 
as it comes to you?” 



M acdonald sighed. “We 

clean it up,” he admitted. 
“The natural universe makes a 
great deal of noise, somewhat 
like the noise of a city — and we 
must filter that out.” 

Jeremiah smiled. 

“We have techniques,” Mac- 
Donald said. “They are verifiable. 
They work. And then there is the 
signal itself. It must be identified, 
analyzed.” 

Jeremiah nodded. “And then?” 
“And then,” MacDonald ad- 
mitted, “we must interpret the 
Message. It is not a simple mat- 
ter, you understand, because the 
Message comes from far away, so 
far it takes forty-five years for the 
signal to reach us. And it comes 
from an alien mind.” 

“Then you will never read your 
message,” Jeremiah said, “or you 
will read into it whatever you 
wish, because there is no possible 
communication between alien 
minds.” 

“What about man and God?” 
“Man is made in God’s im- 
age,” Jeremiah said. 

MacDonald made a gesture of 
frustration and then continued. 
“What alien minds have in com- 
mon is intelligence and the natural 
universe. Matter reacts in the 
same way everywhere in the uni- 
verse, forming the same elements 
which combine in the same way to 
form molecules — the same kinds of 
energy are available, all obedient

verywhere must cope with their 
nvironment in the certain basic 
/ays to satisfy basic needs. And if 
hey communicate with each oth- 
r in a variety of ways — they will 
ind ways that compare with the 
xperience of other intelligent 
reatures. And if they try to 
ommunicate with other worlds 
hey will refer to these common 
xperiences: measurements, math- 
matics, sensory impressions, im- 
ges, abstractions — ” 

“Faith?” Jeremiah asked. 

Judith’s hand tightened on Mit- 
hell’s. 

“Perhaps — ” MacDonald began. 

“Don’t patronize me," Jere- 
liah said. 

“But we would not know how to 
epict faith,” MacDonald went on 
without pausing. 

Jeremiah gestured impatiently. 

1 believe you are sincere. You 
lay be deluded, but you are sin- 
ere. Show me what you brought 
le here to see and let me return 
i my mission.” 

“All right,” MacDonald said, 
le seemed like a defeated man. 
litchell felt sorry for him, but he 
ould have told him that no effort 
i reason with Jeremiah would 
ucceed. Mitchell had tried it too 
ften in the past. Jeremiah was 
nmovable. How did one reason 
dth a fanatic? “I just want you to 
nderstand what we have done,” 
lacDonald continued, “so that 



the result is intelligible to you 
when it comes from the computer. 
Olsen?” 

“We kept searching for a mean- 
ingful pattern in the brief bursts 
of energy we were receiving — ” 
Olsen began. 

“Yom tell me,” Jeremiah said to 
MacDonald. 

MacDonald shrugged. “Dots 
and silence. That’s what I said to 
you. Dots and silence. And then 
Bill here said, ‘Dots and blanks,’ 
and something fell into place. The 
Capellans might be trying to send 
us a visual message with the 
sounds standing for black dots and 
the silences for white spaces. 
Frank Drake suggested the possi- 
bility more than fifty years ago. He 
sent a message to fellow scientists 
made up of a series of ones and 
zeroes and his colleagues made a 
picture out of it. Perhaps we 
should have thought of it. Our ex- 
cuse, I suppose, is that we didn’t 
have a neat little row of binary 
symbols; instead we had dots and 
long silences, and we weren’t sure 
when the message began or when 
it ended. Now I think we can do it. 
We have asked the computer to 
plot the Message onto a grid, 
using prime numbers for the sides 
of the grid, breaking up the silence 
into signals equaling the dots in 
duration, like a switch turning on 
and off.” 

“Or like a computer,” Olsen 
interjected, “with only two num- 



0 



GALAXY 




bers, one and zero.” 

“If we plot the signals as dark 
and light,” MacDonald said, 
“then we may come up with a rec- 
ognizable picture.” 

“May?” Jeremiah asked. “You 
haven’t tried it yet?” 

“Not yet,” MacDonald said. 
“Sometimes a man has a con- 
viction — you might call it a revela- 
tion — that he has found the answer. 
I think we have found it. I wanted 
you to see it with us, the first 
time.” 

“You had a revelation?” 
“Perhaps. We’ll see.” 

“I don’t believe it,” Jeremiah 
said, turning away. “You are try- 
ing to deceive me. You would not 
bring me here without having 
tested your theory first.” 



M acdonald put out a hand 
as if to touch Jeremiah and 
stopped. “Wait. You have come 
this far. At least see what we have 
to show you.” 

Jeremiah stopped. “Do not tell 
me any more lies,” he said harshly. 
“Show me your deception from 
the machine and let me go.” 

“For God’s sake,” said some- 
one from among MacDonald’s 
colleagues, “let’s get it over with.” 
The man’s voice was shaky. 

In the corner the stuffed ostrich 
looked over the proceedings with 
inscrutable eyes. There were some 
advantages Mitchell thought, to 



not caring if you understood 
others or they understood you. 

MacDonald sighed and nodded 
at Olsen. The computer expert 
punched a sequence of buttons on 
the keyboard in front of him. 
Tapes turned on one of the com- 
puter consoles and then on anoth- 
er. Before Olsen a series of ones 
and zeroes appeared on the screen, 
faded, were replaced by others. 
Before Jeremiah a continuous 
roll of paper began to reel silently 
out of the printer. 

The first few grids were mean- 
ingless. 

“Folly,” Jeremiah muttered and 
again began to turn. 

MacDonald was in his way. 
“Wait!” he repeated. “The com- 
puter is running through the small 
prime numbers across and down 
and then the other way, explor- 
ing all the possibilities.” 

The computer reached nineteen 
plotted against all the smaller 
prime numbers and then the larger 
ones. Suspense grew at the same 
rate as disappointment. The com- 
puter hummed. Paper reeled from 
the printer. 

Then it began, something that 
looked intelligible, printed from 
the bottom, line by line. 

“There’s something,” MacDon- 
ald said. “Look!” 

Sourly, skeptically, Jeremiah 
looked and then with growing dis- 
belief continued to look. 

“That square in the corner,” 



THE MESSAGE

MacDonald said, “that could be a 
sun. Those dots on the right. They 
look like — look like — ” 

“Binary numbers,” Olsen said. 

“But not quite,” MacDonald 
said. 

“They’re printed from the 
right,” Olsen said. “Look, nine, 
eight, seven, six, five — ” 

“Of course,” MacDonald said, 
exultation growing in his voice, 
“why should we expect them to 
read from the left, why not the 
right, like the Japanese, or from 
the bottom up?” 

“This is ridicu — ” Jeremiah be- 
gan. 

“But what are those symbols on 
the left-hand side?” MacDonald 
asked. “And on the right-hand side 
of the sun?” 

“Measurements?” someone 
suggested. 

“Formula?” said another. 

“Words?” suggested a third. 

“Maybe words,” MacDonald 
said. “Numbers on the right, 
printed horizontally, words on the 
left with a vertical component. It 
looks like they’re building up a 
vocabulary of numbers and 
words.” 

“Legs,” Jeremiah muttered. 
“Feet.” 

“Yes,” MacDonald said. “Long 
legs, and a body, arms — more than 
one set of arms, and over there at 
the right — what?” 

“If those are words on the left,” 
someone said, “then one of them 



is repeated three times.” 

“Must be important,” some- 
one else said. “It looks like the 
creature is pointing at two of 
them.” 

And then the picture was com- 
plete. Olsen pressed a key. The 
printed stopped. The computer 
stopped. In silence they stared at 
the picture. 




“If that’s a sun in the lower left, 
then that’s another sun in the up- 
per right,” someone said. “Of 



92 



GALAXY 




course. Two suns. Capella.” 

“And that set of dots below 
it — ” MacDonald pointed — “a 
large planet, perhaps a super- 
Jovian, with four satellites, two of 
them larger, perhaps Earth size. 
The being is pointing at one of 
them with one of his four arms.” 

“Not arms,” Jeremiah mut- 
tered. “Two are wings.” 

“But what’s that thing on its 
head?” someone asked. 

Jeremiah put his hands together 
in front of him and lowered his 
face to them, his eyes closed. “For- 
give me,” he said. “Forgive me for 
doubting. It is a message from 
God.” 

“What is he talking about?” 
Mitchell asked Thomas. 

“Quiet,” Thomas said softly. 

The others in the room quieted, 
too, their comments dwindling one 
by one. 

Finally Jeremiah lifted his head 
from his hands. “I will not stand in 
your way,” he said to MacDonald. 
“I will tell my people that I have 
seen the Message and the Mes- 
sage is from God. I do not know 
what it says, but this much I know. 
It is up to you to read the rest of 
it.” 

“I am as much surprised as you 
are,” MacDonald said. 

“I believe that. It would not have 
happened this way had you plan- 
ned it. This is an angel. It has a 
halo.” 

“A halo,” Mitchell echoed. 



“It could be a helmet,” 
MacDonald said gently. “Or ear- 
phones. Or a bird with a large 
head.” 

“You may speculate as you 
wish,” Jeremiah said. “But it is a 
halo. If you do not deny it is an' 
angel, speculate as you will, I will 
not deny that the Message is from 
God, that there are other beings, 
that we call them angels.” 

“You may call them angels,” 
MacDonald said as if expressing 
a formal agreement. “I will not 
say you are mistaken. There is 
much to speculate about and little 
that we can be sure of.” 

“Come, Judith,” Jeremiah said. 
“Father,” Judith said, “Bill has 
something he wants to say.” 

“I misjudged you, sir,” Mitchell 
said. He had been wrong about the 
old man. Jeremiah was not a 
phony. He faced a difficult job, 
going back and reinterpreting 
the Message to his followers, but 
he did not flinch. He had seen the 
truth and changed. Perhaps, 
Mitchell thought, he himself had 
been wrong about some things. 

“I have felt that you were bad 
for my daughter,” Jeremiah said, 
“that you did not like people.” 

“I am beginning to like them 
better,” Mitchell said. 

“Well,” Jeremiah said, turning 
toward the door, “we will see.” 

“I’ll drive you — ” Mitchell be- 
gan. 

“Not yet,” Judith said, giving 

93

his hand a squeeze as she joined her 
father. “In time. If you wish.” And 
she followed her father’s stiff back 
through the doorway. 

ft W HAT luck! ” Mitchell said to 

™ MacDonald. “What magni- 
ficent luck! Or was it?” 

Thomas looked at Mitchell and 
then at MacDonald. MacDonald 
was staring at the picture drawn by 
the printer. He had not heard the 
question. 

“One thing you’ve still got to 
learn,” Thomas said to Mitchell, 
“is that no two people are alike. To 
understand Mac you must under- 
stand that he wouldn’t cheat.” 

“Not even to save the Project?” 
Mitchell asked skeptically. “Not 
even to do tremendous good for 
man and Capellan? Not even to 
counteract stubborn mysticism 
and ignorance?” 

“It sure looks like a big bird,” 
someone said. 

“If it’s a bird,” someone else 
said, “maybe that dot under its feet 
is an egg.” 

“One of the three identical 
words on the left, if they are words, 
is opposite the egg, if it is an egg,” 
Olsen said. 

Mitchell was eyeing Thomas. 

“Not even then,” Thomas said. 
“Not because he wouldn’t be 
tempted, not even because he 
would be found out, but because of 
what he is and because he can’t be 



what he is and be expedient and be- 
cause he knows it.” 

“Look,” someone said, “the two 
suns are different.” 

MacDonald did not move from 
the spot where he could look 
directly down upon the printout. 
The conversation flowed around 
him, but he did not seem to hear it. 
He looked as if he, too, had seen an 
angel. 

Mitchell watched the others in 
the room. Each one was reacting 
differently; each one, like Jere- 
miah, was seeing the same mes- 
sage but reading it according to 
his own particular interpretation. 

Mitchell shook his head and saw 
the stuffed ostrich in the corner. He 
walked to it and looked into its 
black pupils. 

“You’re the only one I really 
understand,” he said. 

He turned and looked at the 
room and all the people clustered 
about the Message, and he 
thought about all the equipment 
and personnel and time that had 
gone into receiving the Message. 
His vision broadened to include 
the steerable radio telescope out- 
side cocked to the night sky and the 
big array in the valley catching 
stardust and he imagined himself 
traveling across great, dark in- 
finities alone in space for long 
years. 

He shivered. 

Who, he thought desperately, 
will understand me? ★

S O we did this column about 
what commercial writing is like, 
and a fair number of professional 
writers were nice enough to agree 
with what was said. 1 got one nasty 
letter, from a nonprofessional, 
who assured me that Norman 
Spinrad and Harlan Ellison were 
somehow exempt from human 
processes. 

1 don't know Spinrad that well. 
But I know Harlan Ellison; we owe 
each other money and we've 
starved and scratched together and 



separately. He's seen the gray look 
on my face and I've seen it on his. 
There is no harder scratcher in this 
field; the only writer of any kind 
I've seen in the same league with 
Ellison was Dick Gehman five 
years ago, and I'd still bet on Har- 
lan to take the pot even if Gehman 
held cards and spades. And maybe 
even the good ten. For all I know, 
Spinrad's been on foundation 
grants all his life, though I serious- 
ly doubt it, but all the writers I 
know — and like anyone else with 



95 



twenty years in the business I 
know hundreds with well-es- 
tablished bylines — have either got 
to make a buck today or else 
worked hard enough to make two 
bucks yesterday. That’s the system. 

There have been a few, in the 
past, who hit hard enough young 
enough, or who worked in Europe 
where things are sometimes dif- 
ferent, or who are wrapped in an- 
tiquity, who somehow in popular 
thought stand away from the com- 
mercial moil. 

There are many who are out- 
wardly smooth enough so that it 
doesn’t show ... for a while. (Did 
you think James T. Farrell was 
stuffed and put in a museum? Do 
you really think Hemingway in- 
cubated that last weak novel in his 
publisher’s safe just to be cute? 
What do you hear from Nelson 
Algren?) Somehow, we like to 
think, there is a place where writ- 
ers can go happily to live on the 
past; a perpetual Thanatopsis 
Society that’s been meeting at 
the Heavenly Algonquin ever 
since Bill Shakespeare’s day. 
(There’s nothing in the grave; the 
dust is pure- gold, and odorless). 
Lenny Bruce entertains at cock- 
tail hour. 

But we do, in science fiction, 
have our little circle of gods who 
must somehow have escaped the 
process; people whose work is 
(paradoxically) somehow bet- 
ter because it was worked away 



from the usual pastures of pulp. 
We believe that way — or, rather, 
some of you believe that way; 1 
don’t — because deep down under- 
neath some of us do believe that 
writing for a living is per se in- 
compatible with excellence. 
Seen through the enchantment 
lent by distance, there is this cir- 
cle of people whose work is better 
because they never had to learn 
how to lie to a bill collector. We 
talk about Wells, and Verne, as if 
they never started at the sound of 
the doorbell; we’ve found out 
about Zamyatin; we’ve been 
brought up to date on Capek. 

Well, l don’t believe that , eith- 
er. Wells had a very rough time of 
it. Verne was like Gehman and 
Charles Dickens. What I believe 
in is excellence, and it so hap- 
pens I see it in several of the gen- 
tlemen named above, most of 
whom I know for a fact were 
scratchers and biters — though 
that may indeed be beside the 
point. Keeping the circle down to 
dead writers for purposes of dis- 
cussion, though, and striking a 
balance between my perhaps 
idiosyncratic view and the popu- 
lar legend, let’s call them the Clas- 
sicists in this field. 



W HAT to do then, with Stan- 
islaw Lem? Walker and Com- 
pany has published the first En- 
glish language translation of one 



96 



GALAXY 




of his novels ( Solaris , $4.95). Now 
at last those of us whose Polish is 
not up to the reading level can get 
some idea of the actual scope of 
this man who is sometimes com- 
pared to Verne and Capek, and 
who is considered fit company for 
Wells, Stapledon, and a number of 
other names which make the earth 
to tremble as their memory strides 
by in the night. 

To help us, in addition to the 
translation by Joanna Kilmar- 
tin and Steve Cox, there is an Af- 
terword by Professor Darko 
Suvin, in the form of an essay on 
Lem’s career to date. This pro- 
vides thumbnail synopses of his 
18 books, and among many other 
useful facts the information that 
Lem has been translated into 
some 40 languages. (Bear that last 
part in mind, will you?) 

Suvin, who takes science fic- 
tion very seriously and is build- 
ing a reputation as a teacher in 
Canada and as a critic, had been 
Lem’s foremost sponsor in our 
circles. And to tell the truth, it 
would be nice to find another cer- 
tified literary giant in this 
field — those other fellows have 
not been producing much lately. 

There is something intrinsically 
attractive in the image of a major 
talent locked away from our par- 
ticular enclave, working, work- 
ing, working, flirting briefly with 
the few bright leaves of American 
and English sf that flutter into 



his gloomy cognitive cell, reject- 
ing them finally in 1965 “a point 
at which he seems to have given up 
western sf in disgust” according 
to Suvin, and molding his own 
expression at last out of the di- 
verse elements of classic sf, com- 
mercial sf of the 1940s and 50s, 
and the cultural heritage of 
Eastern Europe. Surely what 
such a man might accomplish 
would be recognizably powerful 
on the one hand, and contagious- 
ly innovative on the other. 

But what to do with what we 
have of Stanislaw Lem? The trans- 
lated Solaris is not rendered in- 
to our Anglic symbological con- 
text from the Polish, a Slavic lan- 
guage, but from a Romance 
(French) translation — it is a Xerox 
of a Xerox at best, and more like- 
ly a pale carbon. 

Nor is Suvin’s contact with his 
protege an intimate one: 

‘‘Since Lem is too busy to an- 
swer bibliographical questions, my 
information had to be obtained 
from his agent Mr. Franz Rotten- 
steiner and a variety of minor sec- 
ondary sources of unknown accur- 
acy, indeed intermittently contra- 
dictory. The bibliograpy should be 
fairly accurate, since Mr. Rotten- 
steiner’s data (very helpful in this 
endeavor) have been independently 
checked by myself.” 

There is something about all this 
which smacks irresistibly of the 
James Thurber story about the re- 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



97 




nowned novelist who never wrote 
a word and whose epitaph was 
“Our loss is Hell’s gain.” But 
since we are here dealing with a 
snapshot of a shadow thrown on a 
translucent panel, that kind of 
wisecrack is not only cheap, it is 
infinitely reproducible. Literally, 
the atmosphere wrapped about this 
entire project is that anybody can 
be making anything he pleases out 
of anything he claims to perceive, 
without fear of definitive contra- 
diction. 

It so happens that Professor 
Suvin’s bibliographical sketch of 
Lem’s general approach indi- 
cates that enigma is exactly the 
writer’s strong suit; certainly, 
this particular utterance of Sol- 
aris fits right into the spirit. The 
problem is not that one can’t 
make heads nor tails of it; one can 
make as many as one desires and 
have parts left over no matter 
what sort of chimera results. 
Since the locale of the book is a 
planet whose sole native inhabi- 
tant is an apparently living pan- 
genic ocean with inconsistent and 
capricious powers, and the nar- 
rative is a catalogue of futile ef- 
forts to make sense of what the 
ocean does in — debatable — re- 
sponse to human investigation, 
we are indeed left with what Suvin 
calls “The open-ended parable of 
Stanislaw Lem and Solaris ,” and 
others might call a hoax. 

Why not? Going by what little 

98 



can be gathered from the thready 
evidence of this diffused volume, 
Suvin could be benignly kidding 
either us or himself, and the same 
could be true of Lem. They could 
both be members of that popu- 
lous tribe of earnest metaphysi- 
cians which has done so much over 
the centuries to make Europe- 
an philosophical scholarship a 
scrupulous study with ambigu- 
ous results. 



I N LEM’S or Suvin’s case, we 
could be seeing an illustration of 
the fact that while we may grant 
that genius consists of an infinite 
capacity for taking pains, an infi- 
nite taking of pains does not re- 
quire the capacity of a genius. See 
your nearest postal clerk. 

The plot of Solaris , which Suvin 
inaccurately calls a detective puz- 
zle — apparently not as aware of the 
formalities of that genre as he is of 
classic science fiction — is an unre- 
solved one; Kelvin, the protago- 
nist, is shown attempting to come 
to grips with the enigmatic nature 
of the “ocean” on Solaris, the 
(presumably) single planet of the 
Centaurian binary system. 

That is the sole and entire plot. 
Kelvin has this problem, as hun- 
dreds of Terrestrial investigators 
have had it before him, and in the 
end he — and everyone else— still 
has it. 

There are several sub-plots, one 

GALAXY 




or two of which do resolve. For 
instance, the investigative base is 
an artificial station floating above 
the '‘ocean," suspended by mag- 
netic and gravitic fields. Once 
staffed by numerous techni- 
cians and by robots of unspeci- 
fied functional ability, it now re- 
flects the downhill nature of the 
enterprise by having only three 
living staff members — Snow, who 
is frightening and disillusion- 
ing himself to death; Sartorius, 
who stays in his room and rattles 
apparatus; and Kelvin, who ar- 
rives to find that Gibarian, his pre- 
ceptor, is newly dead. The robots 
are locked away. 

Apart from a barefoot Negress 
who lies sleeping against Gi- 
barian’s body in the cold storage 
room, and the unseen but fierce 
creatures whom Sartorius and 
Snow attempt to keep suppressed 
in their quarters, there are no oth- 
er actors to account for the brok- 
en locks, bent doors, smashed pan- 
els and scattered laboratory 
equipment, except for Rheya, 
Kelvin’s suicidal woman, who 
shortly turns up in his cabin, is 
very possessive of him, and is 
capable of reattempting suicide 
by drinking liquid oxygen with- 
out suffering damage of any 
great duration. 

The phenomenon of these inhu- 
manly resilient doppelgangers ac- 
counts for the mystery of the 
smashed furnishings, thus resolv- 



ing one sub-plot which endures for 
several early chapters because 
Snow, who could clear it up in a 
paragraph, simply refuses to say 
the words. Apparently, they are 
sent by the “ocean" as, perhaps, 
instruments to study the investi- 
gators. (Since attempts to obtain 
even the slightest privacy from 
them are what drives them into 
frenzy, the “instrument" hypothe- 
sis is one of the few probably valid 
conclusions to be drawn about 
them by the station staff). 

The doppelgangers — which sim- 
ply materialize on board the sta- 
tion — are apparently created by 
the “ocean’s" being able to read 
the subconscious minds of the 
station personnel and supply- 
ing each with the one individual 
who represents their greatest 
psychic trauma. Thus Kelvin gets 
a representation of Rheya, who 
died years ago on Earth when he 
left her. (Suvin says “wife" — there 
is no evidence for a formal rela- 
tionship, however). Now she 
can’t be separated from him. 
She’s unkillable; the best he can 
do is trick her on board a recon- 
naissance rocket and fire her off 
into orbit, where, perhaps, she 
continues to pound against the 
casing long after the “oxygen’’ 
runs out. 

Since Lem specifies that Kelvin 
comes to the station in a similar 
vehicle while wearing a pressur- 
ized suit, it’s not clear why the

rocket also has a life-support 
system; Terrestrial technology 
as depicted in Solaris is long past 
the point of having to design re- 
dundancy into its space vehicles. 
In any event, next night a fresh 
copy is on hand, unaware that 
she’s a duplicate, amnesiac about 
most of her past except that she 
loves Kelvin. 

A few rudimentary experiments, 
hitherto unperformed by any pre- 
vious staff member on his own 
doppelganger, reveal that Rheya is 
based on neutrino structures, as 
distinguished from atomic. 

I’m not competent to know 
whether this is gibberish; two 
stages of translation intervene be- 
tween my poor power and the au- 
thor’s perhaps plausible rationale. 
However, there are curious other 
parallels between Suvin’s style in 
bibliographical sketches and Lem’s 
narrative: 

“The symmetriad (One of sev- 
eral types of spontaneous hard- 
ened formations which appear on 
the planetary being’s usually 
liquid surface from time to time) 
now begins to display its most 
exotic characteristic —the property 
of ‘illustrating,’ sometimes con- 
tradicting, various laws of physics 
. The interior of the symmetriad 
becomes a factory for the produc- 
tion of ‘monumental machines,’ 
as these constructs are sometimes 
called, although they resemble no 
machine which it is within the pow- 



er of mankind to build: the desig- 
nation is applied because all this 
activity has finite ends, and is 
therefore in some sense ‘mechani- 
cal.’” 

This has to be bad translation to 
some extent. The shift within the 
definition, which begins by talking 
about factories and constructs and 
ends with reference to activity, is 
difficult to explain otherwise. Sim- 
ilarity, though the word here is 
“machines,” what Lem goes on to 
describe are exclusively architec- 
tural features — groins, vaults, pil- 
lars, etc. — rather than shafts, 
gears, cathodes, lenses, resonators 
and other transmission devices. 
Since anything recognizably me- 
chanical must by definition have 
recognizable parts with centuries- 
old names, they are prima facie 
not at all beyond the power of in- 
terstellar Mankind to build. Nor 
is that business about “finite ends” 
a usual or useful description of 
mechanical qualities. It would per- 
mit a tree to be described as a ma- 
chine, and while one certainly 
could so describe any organism, I 
fail to grasp why one should ac- 
cept verisimilitude for an appella- 
tion so far in left field as “monu- 
mental machines” instead of such 
far more likely ones as “cathed- 
ra,” “amphitheatra,” or even “ar- 
chitectura.” 

B UT not all of this is enigmatic 
solely in the language. Howev- 



100

er he couched it, Lem fails to il- 
lustrate his assertion that the sym- 
metriads “in which even the laws 
of physics do not hold” (P. 1 17), 
have the property of illustrating, 
(P. 118) sometimes contradicting, 
various laws of physics. 

The laws of physics obviously 
do hold; Lem shows us nothing be- 
ing done by the symmetriad which 
cannot be accomplished by pres- 
sure, tension, compression and 
gravitic manipulation on the 
same order as that employed by 
the Terrestrial station. That is 
gibberish, down on the basic lev- 
el of thought, rather than among 
superficialities of expression. 

Perhaps he means Newtonian 
physics or, more likely, Archi- 
medean mechanics. Even then 
very little happens in the sym- 
metriad that Archimedes couldn’t 
understand on the spot. 1 venture 
to say nothing happens that 
Archimedes couldn’t account for 
after a few weeks of night school. 
For one thing is very clear — the 
Solaris ph enomena have never 
been studied by a single first-class 
mind, out of the hundreds that 
have come to do so; certainly, the 
three chucklehead "‘scientists” 
who resolutely fail to do any- 
thing fundamentally rational in 
Solaris have to be — to put it mild- 
ly^ — charletans. 

You may have felt the stirrings 
of a powerful story in the doppel- 
ganger sub-plot. Little actual trace 



of it emerges from the Walker ren- 
dering. In the particular case of 
Kelvin and the second Rheya, 
with whom he says he is in 
love — says to her and to us — there 
is no incidence of tenderness. 
There are speeches — Solaris is 
full of speeches and excerpts from 
books on Solaris — but there is no 
confirming action; no moment 
when Kelvin is shown forgetting 
himself long enough to take de- 
light in Rheya’s form or habits, or 
in the slightest personal inti- 
macy accurately described. 1 
specifically don’t demand 
scenes of throbbing sexual pas- 
sion here; rather, I would expect 
that a writer trying to work with 
this situation, in which Kelvin is 
said to be trapping himself by lov- 
ing the “ocean’s” instrument, 
would show us examples of their 
emotional fixation on each oth- 
er, as far more revelatory than 
their mutual inability to be phy- 
sically apart. 

There’s a difference between 
“sleeping together” and sleeping 
together. 

(Eventually, by the way, Sar- 
toris and Snow destroy Rheya off- 
stage with a neutrino-structure- 
neutralizing machine Sartoris has 
whipped up in the laboratory, 
where he’s haunted by a neutrino- 
structured doppelganger who 
watches his every move. Kelvin 
goes off and sits on a symmetriad, 
and the narrative ends).

There is really only one remain- 
ing kind hypothesis to be held 
about this book, and about Lem as 
we glimpse him here and in the Su- 
vin essay. That is that the man is 
definitely not a Verne or Wells 
or Stapledon — none of those gen- 
tlemen would have found merit in 
talking scientific nonsense in a 
science-fiction story — however 
allegorical or satirical. That 
leaves Capek, and the proposition 
that Lem is being funny. But one 
fast pass through R.U.R. or The 
War With the Newts also shows a 
mind too precise to think that sa- 
tire excuses logical contradic- 
tion. 

So that comparison, too, is 
washed out. 

Lem’s unique gift to the kind of 
science fiction written by classi- 
cists, then, apparently is no more 
than an infusion of the same lack 
of logical rigor as that which dis- 
tinguishes much “New Wave’’ 
commercial sf of the ’sixties, in 
which illusions of profundity are 
generated by imprecise refer- 
ence, paradoxic exposition and 
a ruthless unwillingness to let the 
characters act as smart as they 
say they are. You can accomplish 
anything that way — prove that all 
the angels can dance on the head 
of a pin, indite a treatise on a life- 
time’s study of the properties of 
Phlogiston, sit burning in the ru- 



ins of your house while rapt in con- 
templation of the Panacea. 

But to be a true contributor to 
literature and deserve the reputa- 
tion of having refined human 
awareness to even the slightest 
extent— as Wells has, as Capek 
and Stapledon may have, as 
Verne the ingenious commercial 
hack has not — you have to play by 
rules other than your own, and 
that makes it harder. 

The burden is not really on Lem; 
at no point in Solaris does the 
author speak. Who knows whether 
he aspires to be a giant? There’s 
nothing in the contract that says 
every writer must commit him- 
self to a serious exploration of 
human nature, conducted in a 
manner whose every step is be- 
yond question as sound experi- 
mental technique; that’s a tough- 
er row to hoe than many hands are 
fit for. One can be charming and 
entertaining while eschewing all 
that, and ashamed before no one. 

No, the burden falls on those 
who want to place Lem in the pan- 
theon with Capek, Zamyatin, and 
those other fellows. An advo- 
cate who goes on to mention 
Yefremov and the Strugatskys in 
the same breath with his candi- 
date is already begging the ques- 
tion; if he’s got a giant under the 
saddle, what’s he doing entering 
him on the same track with mere 
competents?

tt¥T CAN hardly be continental 

*drift,” said the pale anthro- 
pologist. “There is no way these 
shards could have found their way 
from the bottom of the mid-Atlan- 
tic to the Bay of Bengal. My theo- 
ry is that this is all that remains of 
the cargo of a merchant vessel be- 
tween Atlantis and primeval 
India.” 

“Then why,” said his ruddier- 
complected companion, “is the 
clay of a sort found only in the In- 
dian Ocean area? It had to be fired 
there.” 

“Perhaps it was,” said Fredrik 
Wilkes, the anthropologist, with a 
dismissive shrug of his thin shoul- 
ders. “I see no reason why the ship 
could not have been en route from 
India to ancient Atlantis when it 
sank. Since the original tablet 
must have been borne by a courier 
— at least, it seems to be some sort 
of battle bulletin — it is certainly 
logical that it be inscribed in the 
Atlantean tongue, since that was 
the language spoken by the people 
at the tablet’s intended destination, 
George.” 

George Bradley, the man ad- 
dressed, chuckled and shook his 
head. 

“You miss my meaning, Fred. 
The kind of continental drift I had 
in mind was the cataclysmic kind 
— straight down. My contention is 
that this tablet came from the lost 
continent of Lemuria. The conti- 
nent was reputedly located in the 



Indian Ocean, as I suppose you 
know.” 

“And inscribed in the Atlantean 
tongue?” said Wilkes, with a skep- 
tical sniff. “Don’t be ridiculous. 
Atlantis and Lemuria had nothing 
in common.” 

“They both vanished from the 
face of Earth,” George observed 
dryly. 

Wilkes’ normal pallor flushed a 
splotchy pink. “You know very 
well what I mean. There is no 
proof the two continents even 
existed in the same age!” 

George lifted the deeply in- 
scribed rectangle of fired clay and 
turned it slowly over between his 
thick strong fingers. 

“There’s this,” he said quietly. 

It was the anthropologist’s turn 
to chuckle and he took it. 

“Are you postulating an inter- 
continental war between Atlantis 
and Lemuria, George?” he scoffed. 
“There is no evidence of one in 
this message, if you are.” 

“What I’m postulating,” George 
said slowly, “is an intercontinental 
entente between the two, against a 
common enemy. This message,” 
he said, tapping the hard clay tab- 
let with a fingernail for emphasis, 
“I believe to be an urgent cry for 
help — one which never arrived in 
Atlantis — from the doomed Le- 
murian continent.” 

Wilkes removed rimless bifocals 
to stare better at his friend. 

“You’re not suggesting the corn- 



104

mon enemy possessed the firepow- 
er to wipe that continent off the 
globe?’' he said incredulously. 
‘There’s not a nation on the plan- 
et today that could pull off such a 
cataclysm. Level an enemy coun- 
try, yes, right to the bare soil. But 
sink a continent? Never!” 

“7Vo continents, Fred. Two. 
Atlantis went under shortly there- 
after.” 

“But what enemy? There is no 
record of any civilization existing 
at the time of Atlantis that could 
do more than launch an army of 
foot soldiers in an attack — and on 
wooden ships, at that. What enemy 
could possibly — ” 

“No enemy on Earth,” George 
interrupted. “If you take my mean- 
ing.” 

“An extraterrestrial enemy?” 
exclaimed the other man. “Are you 
saying Atlantis and Lemuria fell 
victim to an interplanetary war?!” 
“Not quite,”, said George. 
“What I had in mind was more — 
interstellar.” He turned the tablet 
toward his friend and jabbed a fin- 
ger toward a row of archaic At- 
lantean symbols. “What does this 
particular glyph convey to you?” 
“Superstitious poppycock,” said 
Wilkes. “The ancient necroman- 
cers of the land undoubtedly found 
the zodiacal aspects very poor for 
battle and were warning the gen- 
erals against a move which did not 
fit their horoscope.” 

“Fred,” said George, patiently, 



“what does it say — exactly?” 

Fred Wilkes considered the line 
in question carefully, then pursed 
his lips and blinked owlishly. Then 
he replaced his spectacles and read 
it again. After a moment, he 
looked up at George. “Well,” he 
said reluctantly, “I think I see 
what you mean — that bit about 
‘the stars against us’ could have a 
bit more rational meaning than 
the usual astrological interpreta- 
tion. But surely — ” 

“We’re only absolutely sure of 
one thing,” said George. “Atlantis 
and Lemuria were continents — one 
in the Atlantic, the other in the In- 
dian Ocean — and, within a rela- 
tively short space of time of one 
another, both were wiped out.” 
“Are we to assume, then, that 
the same thing occurred with the 
enemy?” 

“What do you mean?” asked 
George. 

“This message — from Lemuria 
to Atlantis, if we grant your theo- 
ry — states that attack is imminent 
and that some terrible retaliation 
has been planned. Since we are not 
hipdeep in aliens, George, I can 
only surmise that this intended 
counterattack was carried off suc- 
cessfully, right?” 

G EORGE looked narrowly at 
the anthropologist. “I can tell 
by your momentary acceptance of 
my thesis that you are not con- 



RATEOF EXCHANGE

vinced — you have a sardonic grin 
hiding behind that deadpan stare, 
my friend — right?” 

The other man's smile broke 
through. “You know me too well,” 
he murmured with mild chagrin. 
“Yes, I think I have found a rath- 
er large fly in your cosmic oint- 
ment- the time element, George.” 
George frowned. “I don't follow 
you.” 

“Atlantis — as recent artifacts 
and Carbon-fourteen tests prove 
was a land that had ostensibly been 
civilized for better than a thousand 
years when it perished. It died at 
the height of its grandeur, in the 
full flower of its civilized maturity. 
Now, if we grant that the quarrel 
began with Orion I am assuming 
now that the hunter-glyph in that 
star-phrase represents a place rath- 
er than a heavenly sign of the zo- 
diac if we grant that the quarrel 
began just before the end of the 
two continents — ” 

“Hold on,” said George. “Why 
just before the end?” 

“Let's postulate wildly a mo- 
ment — envision a society as great 
as our own, in the technological 
sense — imagine all sorts of mod- 
ern-day things on these two van- 
ished continents — radar and mis- 
siles and lasers and the like 

“All right,” said George. “Let's. 
But why?” 

“So that an attack from Orion 
— or a planet on one of the stars 
in what we today call Orion 



could be detected before the super- 
bombs landed. That would be the 
aforementioned fly in the oint- 
ment. George — have you forgot- 
ten just how distant the stars are 
from our own solar system? Even 
a missile hurtling out from here 
at the speed of light itself would 
take eons to arrive at its target. 
Let's say, though, that Lemuria's 
radar detected the oncoming Orion 
barrage and that Lemuria imme- 
diately activated its defense setup 
and fired a retaliatory barrage 
back at the enemy, shortly before 
its destruction. The avenging mis- 
siles would not have struck their 
star-distant target for more than a 
millennium of time! Now, this be- 
ing the case, what would be the 
point in sending an urgent mes- 
sage to Atlantis, telling what Le- 
muria had done? The messenger 
could have crawled the distance in 
the intervening years, and still ar- 
rived in plenty of time.” Wilkes 
held a hand up to forestall 
George's reply. “And don't say it 
was because Lemuria had detected 
a backup barrage of missiles timed 
to strike Atlantis as the Earth ro- 
tated it into target range shortly 
after the first barrage — the com 
tinent-sinking barrage — had struck 
Lemuria.” 

George faltered. “That is what 1 
was going to say.” 

“And you don’t see the flaw in 
all your theorizing?” 

George shook his head. 



106 



GALAXY 




“I’m sorry, Fred, but I really 
don’t see any flaw.” 

The anthropologist laughed be- 
nignly. “George — would a civiliza- 
tion that could boast radar and in- 
terstellar missiles ever be likely to 
send an urgent dispatch by foot- 
messenger inscribed upon a clay 
tablet ?” 

George sat silent for a long mo- 
ment. Then he said almost wist- 
fully, “No. No, I guess it wouldn’t. 
Not with radio or telephone or 
some such device at its disposal. I 
guess my theory was a bit cock- 
eyed — ” 

And then he stopped. 

“What is it, George?” asked 
Wilkes, oddly uncomfortable at 
the expression on the other man’s 
face. His friend reached out and 
gripped his forearm. 

“Fred — if that clay tablet — hard- 
fired and nearly indestructible — 
was not intended for the At- 
lanteans — then whom was it in- 
tended for?” 

The anthropologist looked at the 
tablet once again. Its message 
seemed to hover there in deeply 
etched convolutions of fire-red 
warning. And his mind envisioned 
in the fraction of an instant the 
obvious corollary to his earlier 
theory: If the Lemurians fired a 
retaliatory barrage toward Orion 
— and that barrage did take mil- 
lennia to reach its target — and the 
people of Orion were not destroy- 



ed by the avenging bombs — or else 
they detected the approach of their 
own doom in the same manner as 
had Lemuria . Would they not 
send a new barrage , a reprisal bar- 
rage of their own. Earthward 
again? 

The same idea, in an even more 
insidious flash of insight, had come 
to his companion. “Fred,” said 
George, “Orion would have had 
almost a thousand years extra de- 
velopment between the Lemurian 
retaliation and their own — in fact, 
twice a thousand years between the 
Lemurian-bound barrage and their 
second Earthbound retaliation- 
barrage. In all that time, their 
weaponry would have improved 
quite a bit, wouldn’t it? I mean, 
what they dropped out of the cos- 
mos onto Lemuria and Atlantis 
would be like a kid’s firecracker 
compared to what, they sent in the 
next wave, right?” 

Fred nodded, unable to speak. 
Then he straightened, and his man- 
ner became a bit braver. “Of 
course,” he said, with a trace of 
his former good humor, “you real- 
ize that all of this is simply un- 
founded theorizing?” 

George did not reply. George 
was no longer there. In fact, at that 
moment, for a globular radius of 
some three billion miles in all di- 
rections from where the sun had 
been, nothing was any longer there.

1T1HAT afternoon a problem 
* came to me concerning a ship 
from Threish and some false cargo 
manifests and I went to a pier to 
verify the facts. By chance I 
encountered Schweiz. Since part- 
ing from him a few days before, I 
had dreaded meeting him again; it 
would be intolerable, I thought, to 
look into the eyes of this man who 
had beheld my entire self. But then 
I saw him near me on the pier. He 
clutched a thick sheaf of invoices 
in one hand and was shaking the 
other furiously at some watery- 
eyed merchant in Glinish dress. To 
my amazement I felt none of the 
embarrassment I had anticipated, 
but only warmth and pleasure at 
the sight of him. I went to him. 
He clapped my shoulder and I 
clapped his. 

“You look more cheerful now," 
he said. 

“Much.” 

“Let me finish with this scoun- 
drel and weTl share a flask of 
golden, eh?” 

“By all means;” I said. 

An hour later, as we sat togeth- 
er in a dockside tavern, I said, 
u How soon can we leave for 
Sumara Borthan?” 

The voyage to the southern con- 
tinent was conducted as though in a 
dream. Not once did I question 
the wisdom of undertaking the 
journey, nor did I pause to ask 

no 



myself why it was necessary for 
me to take part in person, rather 
than letting Schweiz make the 
trip alone or sending some hireling 
to gather the drug on our behalf. 
I simply set about the task of ar- 
ranging for our passage. 

No commercial shipping goes 
regularly between Velada Borthan 
and Sumara Borthan. Those who 
would travel to the southern con- 
tinent must charter a vessel. This I 
did, through the instrumentality of 
the High Justiciary, using inter- 
mediaries and dummy signatories. 
The vessel I chose was no Manner- 
angi craft, for I did not care to be 
recognized when we sailed, but 
rather a ship of the western 
province of Velis that had been tied 
down in Manneran Harbor for the 
better part of a year by a lawsuit. 
It seemed there was some dispute 
over title to the ship going on in 
its home port, and the thicket of 
injunctions and counter-injunc- 
tions had succeeded in making it 
impossible for the vessel to leave 
Manneran after its last voyage 
there. The captain and crew were 
bitter over this enforced idleness 
and had already filed a protest 
with the Justiciary; but the High 
Justice had no jurisdiction over a 
lawsuit that was being fought en- 
tirely in the courts of Velis. We 
therefore had had to continue the 
stay on the vessel's departure un- 
til word came from Velis that title 
was clear. Knowing all this, I 

GALAXY 




issued a decree in the High 
Justice's name that would permit 
the unfortunate craft temporarily 
to accept charters for voyages to 
points “between the River Woyn 
and the eastern shore of the Gulf of 
Sumar." That usually was taken to 
mean any point along the coast of 
the province of Manneran, but I 
specified also that the captain 
might hire himself out for trips to 
the northern coast of Sumara Bor- 
than. Doubtless that clause left the 
poor man puzzled and it must 
have puzzled him even more when, 
a few days later, he was ap- 
proached by my agents and asked 
to make a voyage to that very 
place. 

To avoid complications with the 
collectors of customs, among 
other things, I picked as our port of 
departure the town of Hilminor, 
in southwestern Manneran on the 
Gulf of Sumar. This is a medium- 
sized place that depends mainly 
on the fishing trade but serves al- 
so as a halfway stop for ships 
traveling between the city of Man- 
neran and the western provinces. 1 
arranged to meet our chartered 
captain in Hilminor; he then set 
out for that town by sea, while 
Schweiz and I made for it in a 
groundcar. 

I T WAS a two-day journey via 
the coastal highway through a 
countryside ever more lush, ever 



more densely tropical as we 
approached the Gulf of Sumar. 
Schweiz was in high spirits, as was 
I. We talked to one another in the 
first person constantly; to him it 
was nothing, of course, but I felt 
like a wicked boy sneaking off to 
whisper “I" and “me" in a play- 
mate's ear. He and I speculated on 
what quantity of the Sumaran drug 
we would obtain and what we 
would do with it. No longer was it 
just a question of my getting some 
to use with Halum: we were talking 
now of proselytizing everyone 
and bringing about a wholesale 
liberation of my self-stifling 
countrymen. That evangelical ap- 
proach had crept gradually into 
our plans almost without my 
realizing it and had swiftly be- 
come dominant. 

We came to Hilminor on a day 
so hot the sky itself seemed to 
break out in blisters. A shim- 
mering dome of heat covered 
everything and the Gulf of Sumar, 
as it lay before us, was golden- 
skinned in the fierqe sunlight. 
Hilminor is rimmed by a chain of 
low hills, which are thickly forested 
on the seaward side and desert on 
the landwards; the highway 
curved through them and we stop- 
ped at one point so that I could 
show Schweiz the flesh trees that 
covered the parched inland slopes. 
A dozen of the trees were clustered 
in one place. We walked through 
crackling tinder-dry underbrush to 

111 



A TIME OF CHANGES 




reach them: twice the height of men 
they were, with twisted limbs and 
thick pale bark, spongy to the 
touch like the flesh of very old 
women. The trees were scarred 
from repeated tapping of their 
sap, making them look all the 
more repugnant. 

“Can we taste the fluid?" 
Schweiz asked. 

We had no implements for mak- 
ing the tap, but just then a girl of 
the town came along, perhaps ten 
years old, half-naked, tanned a 
deep brown to hide the dirt; she 
was carrying an auger and a flask 
and evidently had been sent out by 
her family to collect flesh-tree sap. 
She looked at us sourly. 

I produced a coin and said, “One 
would show his companion the 
taste of the flesh tree." 

Still a sour look; but she jammed 
her auger into the nearest tree with 
surprising force, twisted, with- 
drew it and caught the gush of clear 
thick fluid. Sullenly she handed 
her flask to Schweiz. He sniffed it, 
took a cautious lick, finally had a 
gulp. And whooped in delight. 

“Why isn’t this stuff sold all over 
Velada Borthan?’’ he asked. 

“The whole supply comes from 
one little area along the Gulf," I 
told him. “Most of it’s consumed 
locally and a lot gets shipped to 
Threish, where it’s almost an 
addiction. That doesn’t leave 
much for the rest of the continent. 
You can buy it in Manneran, of 



course, but you have to know 
where to look." 

“You know what I’d like to do, 
Kinnall? I’d like to start a flesh- 
tree plantation, grow them by the 
thousands and get enough juice 
bottled so we not only could 
market it all over Velada Borthan, 
but could set up an export deal. 
I—" 

“Devil!" the girl cried and added 
something incomprehensible in 
the coast dialect, and snatched the 
flask from his hand. She ran off 
wildly, knees high, elbows out- 
thrust, several times looking back 
to make a finger-jabbing sign of 
contempt or defiance at us. 
Schweiz, bewildered, shook his 
head. 

“Is she crazy?" he asked. 

“You said T three times," I 
said. “Very careless." 

“I’ve slipped into bad habits, 
talking with you. But can it really 
be such a filthy thing to say?" 

“Filthier than you’ll ever ima- 
gine. That girl is probably on her 
way to tell her brothers about the 
dirty old man who obscened at her 
on the hillside. Come on: let’s get 
into town before we’re mobbed." 

“Dirty old man," Schweiz mur- 
mured. “Me!" 

I pushed him into the groundcar 
and we hurried toward the port of 
Hilminor.

auxiliary sail, hull painted blue and 
gold. We presented ourselves to 
the captain — Khrisch was his 
name — and he greeted us blandly 
by the names we had assumed. In 
late afternoon we put out to sea. 

The coast of Velada Borthan 
dipped from sight behind me and 
ahead lay only the grand open 
sweep of the Strait of Sumar. No 
land at all could be seen, neither aft 
nor fore. That frightened me. In 
my brief career as a Glinish sea- 
man I had never been far from the 
coast and during stormy moments 
1 had soothed myself with the 
comforting deceit that I might al- 
ways swim to shore if we capsized. 
Here, though, the universe seemed 
all to be of water. As evening ap- 
proached a gray-blue twilight 
settled over us, stitching sky seam- 
lessly to sea, and it became worse 
for me: now there was only our 
little bobbing, throbbing ship adrift 
and vulnerable in this direction- 
less, dimensionless void, this 
shimmering antiworld where all 
places melted into a single non- 
place. I had not expected the strait 
to be so wide. On a map I had seen 
in the Justiciary only a few days 
before the strait had had less 
breadth than my little finger; I had 
assumed that the cliffs of Sumara 
Borthan would be visible to us 
from the earliest hours of the voy- 
age; yet here we were amid noth- 
ingness. I stumbled to my cabin, 
plunged face first onto my bunk 

A TIME OF CHANGES 



and lay there shaking, calling 
upon the god of travelers to pro- 
tect me. Bit by bit I came to loathe 
myself for this weakness. I re- 
minded myself that I was a 
septarch’s son and a septarch’s 
brother and another septarch’s 
cousin, that in Manneran I was a 
man of the highest authority, that 
I was the head of a house and a 
slayer of hornfowl. All this did me 
no good. What value is lineage to a 
drowning man? What use are 
broad shoulders and powerful 
muscles and a skill at swimming 
when the land itself has been 
swallowed up, so that a swimmer 
would have no destination? I 
trembled. I think I may have wept. 

I felt myself dissolving into that 
gray-blue void. Then a hand lightly 
caught my shoulder. Schweiz. 

‘The ship is sound,” he whis- 
pered. “The crossing is a short one. 
Easy. Easy. No harm will come.” 

If it had been anyone else who 
had found me like that, any other 
man except perhaps Noim, I 
might have killed him or myself to 
bury the secret of my shame. 

I said, “If this is what it is like to 
cross the Strait of Sumar, how can 
one travel between the stars with- 
out going mad?” 

“One grows accustomed to tra- 
vel.” 

“The fear — the emptiness — ” 
“Come above.” Gently. “The 
night is very beautiful.” 

Nor did he lie. Twilight was past 

113 




and a black bowl pocked with fiery 
jewels lay over us. Near cities one 
cannot see the stars so well be- 
cause of the lights and the haze. I 
had looked upon the full glory of 
the heavens while hunting in the 
Burnt Lowlands, yes, but then I 
had not known the names of what 1 
saw. Now Schweiz and Captain 
Khrisch stood close alongside me 
on deck, taking turns calling out 
the names of stars and constella- 
tions, vying with each other to dis- 
play their knowledge, each one 
pouring his astronomy into my 
ear as though I were a terrified 
child who could be kept from 
screaming only by a constant 
flow of distractions. See? See? And 
see, there? I saw. A host of our 
neighboring suns, four or five of 
the neighbor-planets of our system 
and even a vagrant comet that 
night. What they taught me stayed 
with me. 1 could step out of my 
cabin now, I believe, here in the 
Burnt Lowlands, and call off the 
stars the way Schweiz and the 
captain called them off to me 
aboard ship in the Strait of Sumar. 
How many more nights do 1 have, 1 
wonder, on which 1 will be free to 
look at the stars? 

M ORNING brought an end to 
fear. The sun was bright, the 
sky was lightly fleeced, the broad 
strait was calm and it did not mat- 
ter to me that land was beyond 
sight. We glided toward Sumara 



Borthan in an almost imper- 
ceptible way; I had to study the 
surface of the sea with care to re- 
mind myself we were in motion. 
A day, a night, a day, a night, a 
day, and then the horizon sprouted 
a green crust for there was Sumara 
Borthan. It provided a fixed point 
for me, except that we were the 
fixed point and Sumara Borthan 
was making for it. The southern 
continent slid steadily toward us, 
until at last I saw a rim of bare 
yellow-green rock stretching 
from east to west. Atop those 
naked cliffs rose a thick gap of 
vegetation, lofty trees knitted to- 
gether by heavy vines to form a 
closed canopy, stubbier shrubs 
clustering in the darkness below, 
everything cut down the side as if 
to reveal the jungle's edge to us in 
cross-section. I felt not fear but 
wonder at the sight of that jungle. I 
knew that not one of those trees 
and plants grew in Velada Bor- 
than; the beasts and serpents and 
insects of this place were not those 
of the continent of my birth; what 
lay before us was alien and per- 
haps hostile, an unknown world 
awaiting the first footstep. In a 
tumble of tangled imaginings I 
dropped down the well of time and 
saw myself as an explorer peeling 
the mystery from a newly found 
planet. Those gigantic boulders, 
those slender, high-crowned trees, 
those dangling snaky vines, all 
were products of a raw, elemental 



114 



GALAXY 




mystery straight out of evolution’s 
belly, which now I was about to 
penetrate. That dark jungle was 
the gate to somethng strange and 
terrible, I thought, yet I was not 
frightened so much as I was stirred, 
deeply moved, by the vision of 
those sleek cliffs and tendriled 
avenues. This was the world that 
existed before man came. This was 
as it was when there were no god- 
houses, no drainers; no Port Justi- 
ciary: only the silent leafy paths 
and the surging rivers scouring the 
valleys; the unplumbed ponds and 
the long heavy leaves glistening 
with the jungle’s exhalations; the 
unhunted prehistoric beasts turn- 
ing in the ooze and the fluttering 
winged things that knew no fear; 
the grassy plateaus and the veins of 
precious metals — a virgin king- 
dom and over everything the 
brooding presence of the gods, of 
the god, of the god, waiting for the 
time of worshipers. The lonely 
gods who did not yet know they 
were divine. The lonely god. 

Of course the reality was noth- 
ing so romantic. There was a place 
where the cliffs dipped to sea-level 
and yielded to a crescent harbor. 
Here a squalid settlement existed, 
the shacks of a few dozen Sumarnu 
who had taken to living here so 
that they might meet the needs of 
such ships as occasionally did come 
from the northern continent. I had 
thought that all the Sumarnu lived 
somewhere in the interior —naked 



tribesmen camping down by the 
volcanic peak Vashnir — and that 
Schweiz and I would have to hack 
our way through the whole apoca- 
lyptic immensity of this myste- 
rious land, unguided and uncer- 
tain, before we found what passed 
for civilization and made contact 
with anyone who might sell us that 
for which we had come. Instead, 
Captain Khrisch brought his little 
ship smartly to shore by a 
crumbling wooden pier and, as we 
stepped forth, a small delegation 
of Sumarnu came to offer us a 
sullen greeting. 

You know my fantasy of fanged 
and grotesque Earthmen. So, too, 
I instinctively expected these peo- 
ple of the southern continent to 
look in some way alien. I knew it 
was irrational; they were, after all, 
sprung from the same stock as the 
citizens of Salla and Manneran 
and Glin. But had these centuries 
in the jungle not transformed 
them? Had their disavowal of the 
Covenant not laid them open to 
infiltration by the vapors of the 
forest and turned them into 
unhuman things? No and no. They 
looked to me like peasants of any 
province’s back country. Oh, they 
wore unfamiliar ornaments, odd 
jeweled pendants and bracelets of 
an un-Veladan sort, but there was 
nothing else about them, neither 
tone of skin nor shape of face nor 
color of hair, that set them apart 
from the men I had always known. 

115 



ATIME OF CHANGES 




The homogeneity of mankind’s 
genetic pool had spiked my 
imagination once again. 

T HERE were eight or nine of 
them. Two, evidently the lead- 
ers, spoke the dialect of Man- 
neran, though with a troublesome 
accent. The others showed no sign 
of understanding northern lan- 
guages, but chattered among 
themselves in a tongue of clicks 
and grunts. Schweiz found com- 
munication easier than I did and 
entered a long conversation so dif- 
ficult for me to follow that I soon 
ceased to pay attention. 1 wan- 
dered off to inspect the village. 

When I returned Schweiz said, 
“It’s all arranged.” 

“What is?” 

“Tonight we sleep here. Tomor- 
row they’ll guide us to a village that 
produces the drug. They don’t 
guarantee we’ll be allowed to buy 
any.” 

“Is it only sold at certain 
places?” 

“Evidently. They swear there’s 
none at all available here.” 

I asked, “How long a journey 
will it be?” 

“Five days. On foot. Do you like 
jungles, Kinnall?” 

“I don’t know the taste of them 
yet.” 

“It’s a taste you’re going to 
learn,” said Schweiz. 

He turned now to confer with 
Captain Krisch, who was planning 



to go off on some expedition of his 
own along the Sumaran coast. 
Schweiz arranged to have our ship 
back at this harbor waiting for us 
when we returned from our trip in- 
to the jungle. Krisch’s men un- 
loaded our baggage — chiefly 
trade-goods for barter, mirrors and 
knives and trinkets, since the 
Sumarnu had no use for Veladan 
currency — and got their ship out 
into the strait before night fell. 

Schweiz and I had a shack for 
ourselves on a lip of rock over- 
looking the harbor. Mattresses of 
leaves, blankets of animal hide, one 
lopsided window, no sanitary 
facilities: this is what the thou- 
sands of years of man’s voyage 
through the stars have brought us 
to. We haggled over the price of 
our lodgings, finally came to an 
agreement in knives and heat-rods 
and at sundown were given our 
dinner. A surprisingly tasty stew 
of spicy meats, some angular red 
fruits, a pot of half-cooked vege- 
tables, a mug of what might have 
been fermented milk — we ate 
what was given us and enjoyed it 
more than either of us had ex- 
pected, though we made edgy jokes 
about the diseases we were likely to 
catch. I poured out a libation to 
the god of travelers, more out of 
habit than conviction. 

Schweiz said, “So you still be- 
lieve, after all?” 

“I replied that I found no rea- 
son not to believe in the gods, 



116 



GALAXY 




though my faith in the teachings of 
men had been greatly weakened. 

This close to the equator dark- 
ness came on swiftly, a sudden 
black curtain rolling down. We sat 
outside a little while, Schweiz 
favoring me with some more 
astronomy and testing me on what 
I had already learned. Then we 
went to bed. 

XV 

F IVE days. Six, actually: either 
Schweiz had misunderstood, or 
the Sumarnu chieftain was poor at 
counting. We had one guide and 
three bearers. I had never walked 
so much before, from dawn to sun- 
set, the ground yielding and 
bouncy beneath my feet. The 
jungle rising, a green wall, on both 
sides of the narrow path. Astonish- 
ing humidity, so that we swam in 
the air, worse than on the worst 
day in Manneran. Insects with 
jeweled eyes and terrifying beaks. 
Slithering, many-legged beasts 
rushing past us. Strugglings and 
horrid cries in the underbrush, 
just beyond sight. The sunlight 
falling in dappled streaks, barely 
making it through the canopy high 
above. Flowers bursting from the 
trunks of trees: parasites, Schweiz 
said. One of them a puffy yellow 
thing that had a human face, 
goggly eyes, a gaping pollen- 
smeared mouth. 

We crept up the spine of the con- 



tinent, emerging from the jungle 
for a day and a half to climb a 
good-sized mountain, then more 
jungle on the other side, Schweiz 
asked our guide why we had not 
gone around the mountain instead 
of over it, and was told that this 
was the only route, for poison ants 
infested all the surrounding low- 
lands: very cheering. Beyond the 
mountain lay a chain of lakes and 
streams and ponds, many of them 
thick with gray toothy snouts 
barely breaking the surface. All 
this seemed unreal to me. A few 
days’ sail to the north lay Velada 
Borthan, with its banking houses 
and its groundcars, its customs 
collectors and its godhouses. That 
was a tamed continent, but for its 
uninhabitable interior. Man had 
made no impact at all, though, on 
this place where we marched. Its 
disorderly wildness oppressed me, 
that and the heavy air, the sounds 
in the night, the unintelligible 
conversations of our primitive 
companions. 

On the sixth day we came to the 
native village. Perhaps three hun- 
dred wooden huts were scattered 
over a broad meadow at a place 
where two rivers of modest size ran 
together. I had the impression 
that there once had been a larger 
town here, possibly even a city, for 
on the borders of the settlement I 
saw grassy mounds and humps, 
quite plausibly the site of ancient 
ruins. 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



117 




The villagers surrounded us: not 
hostile, only curious. Northerners 
were uncommon sights. A few of 
them came close and touched me, a 

i 

timid pat on the forearm, a shy 
squeeze of the wrist, invariably 
accompanied by a quick little 
smile. These jungle folk seemed not 
to have the sullen sourness of 
those who lived in the shacks by the 
harbor. They were gentler, more 
open, more childlike. 

An interminable parley began 
among Schweiz, our guide, and 
three of the village elders. After the 
first few moments Schweiz was out 
of it: the guide, indulging in long 
cascades of verbal embellish- 
ments footnoted by frantic 
gesticulations, seemed to be 
explaining the same thing over and 
over to the villagers, who con- 
stantly made the same series of re- 
plies to him. Neither Schweiz nor I 
could understand a syllable of it 
all. At last the guide, looking 
agitated, turned to Schweiz and 
poured forth a stream of Sum- 
arnu-accented Mannerangi, 
which I found almost wholly 
opaque but which Schweiz, with his 
tradesman’s skill at communicat- 
ing with strangers, was able to 
penetrate. 

Schweiz said finally to me, 
“They’re willing to sell to us. Pro- 
vided we can show them that we’re 
worthy of having the drug.’’ 

“How do we do that?” 

“By taking some with them at a 



love ritual this evening. Our 
guide's been trying to talk them 
out of it, but they won’t budge. No 
communion, no merchandise.” 

“Are there risks?” I asked. 

Schweiz shook his head. “It 
doesn’t seem that way to me. But 
the guide has the idea that we’re 
only looking for profit in the 
drug, that we don’t mean to use it 
ourselves but intend to go back to 
Manneran and sell what we get for 
many mirrors and many heat-rods 
and many knives. Since he thinks 
we aren’t users, he’s trying to pro- 
tect us from exposure to it. The vil- 
lagers also think we aren’t users 
and they’re damned if they’ll turn a 
speck of the stuff over to anyone 
who’s merely planning to peddle 
it. They’ll make it available only 
to true believers.” 

“But we are true believers,” 1 
said. 

“1 know. But I can’t convince 
our man of that. He knows enough 
about northerners to know that 
they keep their minds closed at all 
times and he wants to pamper us in 
our sickness of soul. But I’ll try 
again.” 

Now it was Schweiz and our 
guide who parleyed, while the vil- 
lage chiefs stood silent. Adopting 
the gestures and even the accent of 
the guide, so that both sides of the 
conversation became unintelligi- 
ble to me, Schweiz pressed and 
pressed and pressed. The guide re- 
sisted all that the Earthman was 



118 



GALAXY 




telling him and a feeling of despair 
came over me so that I was ready 
to suggest that we give up and go 
empty-handed back to Manneran. 
Then Schweiz somehow broke 
through. The guide, still suspicious, 
clearly asked Schweiz whether he 
really wanted what he said he 
wanted. Schweiz emphatically 
said he did and the guide, looking 
skeptical, turned once more to the 
village chiefs. This time he spoke 
only briefly with them and then 
briefly again with Schweiz. 

“It's been settled/’’ Schweiz told 
me. “Well take the drug with them 
tonight/’ He leaned close and 
touched my elbow. “Something 
for you to remember, when you go 
under: be loving. If you can't love 
them, all is lost." 

1 was offended that he had found 
it necessary to warn me. 

qiEN of them came for us at 

sundown and led us into the 
forest east of the village. Among 
them were the three chieftains and 
two other older men, along with 
two young men and three women. 
One of the women was a hand- 
some girl, one a plain girl and one 
quite old. Our guide did not go with 
us; I am not sure whether he was 
not invited to the ceremony or 
simply did not feel like taking 
part. 

We marched a considerable dis- 
tance. No longer could we hear the 
cries of children in the village or 

A TIME OF CHANGES 



the barking of domestic animals. 
Our halting place was a secluded 
clearing, where hundreds of trees 
had been felled and the dressed logs 
laid out in five rows as benches to 
form a pentagonal amphitheater. 
In the middle of the clearing was a 
clay-lined firepit, with a great heap 
of firewood neatly stacked beside 
it; as soon as we arrived, the two 
young men commenced building 
a towering blaze. On the far side 
of the woodpile I saw a second 
clay-lined pit; about twice as wide 
as a large man’s body; it descended 
diagonally into the ground and 
gave the appearance of being a 
passage of no little depth, a tun- 
nel offering access to the depths of 
the world. 

The Sumarnu showed us through 
gestures where we should sit: at the 
base of the pentagon. The plain 
girl sat beside us. To our left, next 
to the tunnel entrance, sat the 
three chiefs. To our right, by the 
firepit, were the two young men. 
In the far right corner sat the old 
woman and one of the old men; the 
other old man and the handsome 
girl went to the far left corner. Full 
darkness was upon us by the time 
we were seated. The Sumarnu now 
removed what little clothing they 
wore and, seeing them obviously 
beckoning to us to do the same, 
Schweiz and I stripped, piling our 
clothes on the benches behind us. 
At a signal from one of the chiefs 
the handsome girl rose and went 

119 




to the fire, poking a bough into it 
until she had a torch; then, ap- 
proaching the slanting mouth of 
the tunnel, she wriggled awk- 
wardly feet-first into it, holding 
the torch high. Girl and torch dis- 
appeared entirely from view. For a 
little while I could see the flicker- 
ing light of the firebrand coming 
from below, but soon it went out, 
sending up a gust of dark smoke. 
Shortly the girl emerged without 
the torch. In one hand she carried a 
thick-rimmed red pot, in the other 
a long flask of green glass. The two 
old men — high priests? — left their 
benches and took these things from 
her. They began a tuneless chant 
and one, reaching into the pot, 
scooped from it a handful of white 
powder — the drug! —and dropped 
it into the flask. The other 
solemnly shook the flask from side 
to side in a mixing motion. Mean- 
while the old woman — a priest- 
ess? — had prostrated herself by 
the mouth of the tunnel. She be- 
gan to chant in a different intona- 
tion, a jagged gasping rhythm, 
while the two young men flung 
more wood on the fire. The 
chanting continued for a good 
many minutes. Now the girl who 
had descended into the tunnel — a 
slim, high-breasted wench with 
long silken red-brown hair — took 
the flask from the old man and 
brought it to our side of the fire, 
where the plain girl, stepping for- 
ward, received it reverently with 



both hands. Solemnly she carried it 
to the three seated chieftains and 
held it toward them. The chief- 
tains now joined the chanting for 
the first time. What I thought of as 
the Rite of the Presentation of the 
Flask went on and on; I was 
fascinated at first, finding delight 
in the strangeness of the cere- 
mony, but soon I grew bored and 
had to amuse myself by trying to 
invent a spiritual content for what 
was taking place. The tunnel, I de- 
cided, symbolized the genital open- 
ing of the world-mother, the route 
to her womb, where the drug — 
made from a root, from some- 
thing growing underground — 
could be obtained. 1 devised an 
elaborate metaphorical construct 
involving a mother-cult, the sym- 
bolic meaning of carrying a 
lighted torch into the world-moth- 
er’s womb, the use of plain and 
handsome girls to represent the 
universality of womanhood, the 
two young fire-warders as guard- 
ians of the chieftains’ sexual 
potency — and a great deal more, 
all of it nonsense, but — so I 
thought — an impressive enough 
scheme to be assembled by a 
bureaucrat like myself, of no 
great intellectual powers. My 
pleasure in my owrr musings 
evaporated abruptly , when I 
realized how patronizing I was be- 
ing. I was treating these Sumarnu 
like quaint savages, whose chants 
and rites were of mild esthetic 



120 



GALAXY 




interest but could not possibly have 
any serious content. Who was I to 
take this lofty attitude? I had 
come to them, had I not, begging 
the drug of enlightenment that 
my soul craved; which of us then 
was the superior being? I assailed 
myself for my snobbery. Be 
loving . Put aside courtly 

sophistication. Share their rite if 
you can and at the least show no 
contempt for it, feel no contempt, 
have no contempt. Be loving. The 
chieftains were drinking now, 
each taking a sip, handing the 
flask back to the plain-looking girl 
who, when all three had sipped, be- 
gan to move about the circle, bring- 
ing the flask first to the old men, 
then to the old woman, then to the 
handsome girl, then to the young 
fire-tenders, then to Schweiz, then 
to me. She smiled at me as she gave 
me the flask. By the fire’s leaping 
light she seemed suddenly beauti- 
ful. The flask contained a warm 
gummy wine; I nearly gagged as I 
drank. But I drank. The drug 
entered my gut and journeyed 
thence to my soul. 

117 E ALL became one, the ten of 
them and the two of us. First 
there were the strange sensations 
of going up, the heightening of 
perception, the loss of bearings, 
the visions of celestial light, the 
hearing of eerie sounds; then came 
the detecting of other heartbeats 
and bodily rhythms about me, the 



doubling, the overlapping of 
awarenesses; then came the 
dissolution of self and we became 
one, who had been twelve. I was 
plunged into a sea of souls and I 
perished. I was swept into the 
center of all things. I had no way of 
knowing whether I was Kinnall, 
the septarch’s son, or Schweiz, the 
man of old Earth, or the fire- 
tenders, the chiefs, the priests, the 
girls or the priestess, for they were 
inextricably mixed up in me and I 
in them. And the sea of souls was a 
sea of love. How could it be any- 
thing else? We were each other. 
Love of self bound us each to each, 
all to all. Love of self is love of oth- 
ers; love of others is love of self. 
And I loved. I knew more clearly 
than ever why Schweiz had said to 
me, / love you , as we were coming 
out of the drug the first time — that 
odd phrase, so obscene on Bor- 
than, so incongruous in any case 
when man is speaking to man. I 
said to the ten Sumarnu, I love 
you , though not in words, for I had 
no words that they would under- 
stand — and even if I had spoken to 
them in my own tongue and they 
had understood, they would have 
resented the foulness of my 
words, for among my people I love 
you is an obscenity and no help for 
it. I love you. And I meant it, and 
they accepted the gift of my love. I, 
who was part of them. I, who not 
long ago had patronized them as 
amusing primitives worshiping

bonfires in the woods. Through 
them I sensed the sounds of the 
forest, the heaving of the tides 
and, yes, the merciful love of the 
great world-mother, who lies sigh- 
ing and quaking beneath our feet 
and who has bestowed on us the 
drug root for the healing of our 
sundered selves. I learned what it is 
to be Sumarnu and live simply at 
the meeting place of two small 
rivers. I discovered how one can 
lack groundcars and banking 
houses and still belong to the com- 
munity of civilized humanity. I 
found out what half-souled things 
the people of Velada Borthan 
have made of themselves in the 
name of holiness and how whole it 
is possible to be if one follows the 
way of the Sumarnu. None of this 
came to me in words or even in a 
flow of images, but rather in a rush 
of received knowledge, knowl- 
edge that entered and became 
part of me after a manner I can 
neither describe nor explain. I 
hear you saying now that I must 
be either lying or lazy to offer you 
as little specific detail of the ex- 
perience as I have done. But I reply 
that one cannot put into words 
what never was in words. One can 
deal only in approximations and 
one’s best effort can be nothing 
more than a distortion, a coarsen- 
ing of the truth. For I must trans- 
form perceptions into words and 
set them down as my skills per- 
mit — and you must pick my words 



from the page and convert them 
into whatever system of per- 
ceptions your mind habitually em- 
ploys; at each stage of this trans- 
mission a level of density leaches 
away, until you are left only with 
the shadow of what befell me in 
the clearing in Sumara Borthan. 
So how can I explain? We were 
dissolved in one another. We were 
dissolved in love. We, who had no 
language in common, came to 
total comprehension of our 
separate selves. When the drug at 
length lost its hold on us, part of 
me remained in them and part of 
them remained in me. If you 
would know more than that, if you 
would have a glimpse of what it is 
to be released from the prison of 
your skull, if you would taste love 
for the first time in your life, I say 
to you. Look for no explanations 
fashioned out of words, but put the 
flask to your lips. Put the flask to 
your lips. 

117 E HAD passed the test. They 
™ would give us what we wanted. 
After the sharing of love came the 
haggling. We returned to the vil- 
lage and in the morning our bearers 
brought out our cases of trade- 
goods, The three chieftains 
brought out three squat clay pots, 
the white powder visible within 
them. We heaped up a high stack 
of knives and mirrors and heat- 
rods and they carefully poured 
quantities of powder from two of 



122 



GALAXY 




the pots into the third. Schweiz did 
most of the bargaining. The guide 
we had brought from the coast was 
of little value, for, though he could 
talk these chieftains’ language, he 
had never talked to their souls. In 
fact, the bargaining inverted it- 
self suddenly, with Schweiz happily 
piling still more trinkets into the 
price and the chiefs responding by 
adding more powder to our bowl, 
everyone laughing in a sort of 
hysterical good nature as the con- 
test of generosity grew more 
frenzied. In the end we gave the 
villagers everything we had, keep- 
ing only a few items for gifts to our 
guide and bearers, and the vil- 
lagers gave us enough of the drug 
to snare the minds of thousands. 

Captain Khrisch was waiting 
when we reached the harbor. “One 
sees you have fared well,” he re- 
marked. 

“Is it so obvious?” I asked. 

“You were worried men when 
you went into this place. You are 
happy men coming out of it. Yes, 
it is obvious.” 

On the first night of our voyage 
back to Manneran, Schweiz called 
me into his cabin. He had out the 
pot of white powder and he had 
broken the seal. I watched as he 
carefully poured the drug into 
little packets of the kind in which 
that first dose had come. He 
worked in silence, scarcely 
glancing at me, filling some seventy 
or eighty packets. When he was 

A TIME OF CHANGES 



done he counted out a dozen of 
them and pushed them to one side. 
Indicating the others, he said, 
“Those are for you. Hide them well 
about your luggage or you’ll need 
all your power with the Port Justi- 
ciary to get them safely past the 
customs collectors.” 

“You’ve given me five times as 
much as you’ve taken,” I pro- 
tested. 

“Your need is greater,” Schweiz 
told me. 

XVI 

¥ DID NOT understand what he 
* meant until we were in Man- 
neran again. We landed at Hilmi- 
nor, paid Captain Khrisch, went 
through a minimum of inspection 
formalities (how trusting the port 
officials were, not very long ago!) 
and set out in our groundcar for 
the capital. Entering the city of 
Manneran by the Sumar Road, we 
passed through a crowded district 
of marketplaces and open-air 
shops, where I saw thousands of 
Mannerangi jostling, haggling, 
bickering. I saw them driving 
their hard bargains and whipping 
out contract forms to close the 
deals. I saw their faces, pinched, 
guarded the eyes bleak and un- 
loving. And I thought of the drug I 
carried and fold myself, If only I 
could change their frosty souls. I 
had a vision of myself going 
among them, accosting strangers, 

123 




drawing this one aside and that, 
whispering gently to each of them, 
“I am a prince of Salla and a high 
official of the Port Justiciary, 
who has put such empty things 
aside to bring happiness to man- 
kind, and I would show you how to 
find joy through selfbaring. Trust 
me: 1 love you.” No doubt some 
would flee from me as soon as I be- 
gan to speak, frightened by the 
initial obscenity of my “I am.” 
Others might hear me out and 
then spit in my face and call me a 
madman — and some might cry for 
the police — but perhaps there 
would be a few who would listen, 
feel tempted and come off with me 
to a quiet dockside room where we 
could share the Sumaran drug. One 
by one I would open souls until 
there were ten in Manneran like 
me — twenty — a hundred — a sec- 
ret society of selfbarers, knowing 
one another by the warmth and 
love in their eyes, going about the 
city unafraid to say “I” or “me” 
to their fellow initiates, giving up 
not merely the grammar of polite- 
ness but all the poisonous denials 
of self-love that that grammar 
implied. And then I would charter 
Captain Khrisch again for a voyage 
to Sumara Borthan, return- laden 
with packets of white pfowder and 
continue on through Man- 
neran — 1 and those who now were 
like me — and. we would go up to 
this one and that, smiling, glow- 
ing, to whisper, “I would show you 



how to find joy through selfbaring. 
Trust me: I love you.” 

There was no role for Schweiz in 
this vision. This was not his planet; 
he had no stake in transforming it. 
All that interested him was his 
private spiritual need, his hunger to 
break through to a sense of the 
godhood. He had begun that 
breakthrough already and could 
complete it on his own, apart. 
Schweiz had no need to skulk 
about the city, seducing strangers. 
And this was why he had given me 
the greater share of our Sumaran 
booty: I was the evangelist, I was 
the new prophet, I was the messiah 
of openness. Schweiz realized that 
before 1 did. Until now he had 
been the leader — drawing me into 
his confidence, getting me to try 
the drug, luring me off to Sumara 
Borthan, making use of my 
power in the Port Justiciary, keep- 
ing me at his side for companion- 
ship and reassurance and 
protection. 1 had been in his 
shadow throughout. Now he 
would cease to eclipse me. Armed 
with my little packets, I alone 
would launch the campaign to 
change a world. 

It was a role I welcomed. All my 
life I had been overshadowed by 
one man or another, so that for all 
my strength of body and ability of 
mind I had come to seem second- 
rate to myself. Perhaps that is a 
natural defect of being born a 
septarch’s second son. First there 



124 



GALAXY 




had been my father, whom I could 
never hope to equal in authority, 
agility, or might; then Stirron, 
whose kingship brought only exile 
for me; then my master in the 
Glinish logging camp; then 
Segvord Helalam; then Schweiz. 
All of them men of determination 
and prestige, who knew and held 
their places in our world, while I 
wandered in frequent bewilder- 
ment. Now, in the middle of my 
years, I could at last emerge. I had 
a mission. I had purpose. The 
spinners of the divine design had 
brought me to this place, had made 
me who 1 was, had readied me for 
my task. In joy I accepted their 
command. 

T HERE was a girl I kept for my 
sport, in a room on the south 
side of Manneran, in the tangle of 
old streets back of the Stone 
Chapel. She claimed to be a 
bastard of the Duke of Kongoroi, 
spawned when the duke was on a 
state visit to Manneran in the days 
of my father’s reign. Perhaps her 
story was true. Certainly she be- 
lieved it. 1 was in the habit of go- 
ing to her twice or thrice each 
moontime for an hour of plea- 
sure, whenever I felt too stifled by 
the routine of my life, whenever I 
felt boredom’s hand at my throat. 
She was simple but passionate: 
lusty, available, undemanding. I 
did not hide my identity from her, 
but I gave her none of my inner 



self and none was expected; we 
talked very little and there was no 
question of love between us. In 
return for the price of her lodgings 
she let me make occasional use of 
her body and the transaction was 
no more complex than that: a 
touching of skins, a sneeze of the 
loins. She was the first to whom I 
gave the drug. I mixed it with 
golden wine. “We will drink this,” 
I said, and when she asked me why, 
I replied, “It will bring us closer 
together.” She asked, in no great 
curiosity, what it would do to us 
and I explained, “It will open self 
to self and make all walls trans- 
parent.” She offered no pro- 
tests — no talk of the Covenant, no 
whining about privacy, no talk of 
the evils of selfbaring. She did as 
she was told, convinced I would 
bring no harm to her. We took the 
dose and lay naked on her couch, 
waiting for the effects to begin. I 
stroked her cool thighs, kissed the 
tips of her breasts, playfully 
nibbled her earlobes and soon the 
strangeness started, the buzzing 
and the rush of air, and we began 
to detect one another’s heartbeats 
and pulse. 

“Oh,” she said. “Oh, one feels so 
peculiar!” But it did not frighten 
her. Our souls drifted together and 
were fused in the clear white light 
coming from the Center of All 
Things. And I discovered what it 
is like to wriggle one’s shoulders 
and have heavy breasts slap to- 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



125 




gether and I felt eggs throbbing 
and impatient in my ovaries. At the 
height of our voyage we joined our 
bodies. I felt myself moving 
against myself, 1 felt lips on my 
lips, tongue on my tongue, soul in 
my soul. This union of our bodies 
endured for hours, or so it seemed. 
And in that time my self was open 
to her, so that she could see in it all 
she chose, my boyhood in Salla, 
my flight to Glin, my marriage, 
my love for my bondsister, my 
weaknesses, my self-deceptions, 
and I looked into her and saw the 
sweetness of her, the giddiness, 
the moment of first finding blood 
on her thighs, the other blood of a 
later time, the image of Kinnall 
Darival as she carried it in her 
mind, the vague and unformed 
commandments of the Covenant 
and all the rest of her soul’s furni- 
ture. Then we were swept away by 
the storms of our senses. I felt her 
orgasm and mine, mine and mine, 
hers and hers, the double column of 
frenzy and that was one, the rise 
and the fall. We lay sweaty and 
sticky and exhausted, the drug still 
thundering through our joined 
minds. I opened my eyes and saw 
hers unfocused, the pupils dilated. 
She gave me a lopsided smile. 

“I — I — I — I — I,” she said. “IT 
The wonder of it dazed her. 

“I ! I ! I !” I planted a kiss 
between her breasts and felt the 

i 

brush of my lips myself. T love 
you,” I said. 



T HERE was a clerk in the Port 
Justiciary, a certain Ulman, half 
my age and clearly a man of 
promise, whom 1 had come to like. 
He knew my power and my ances- 
try and showed no awe of me over 
that; his respect for me was based 
entirely on my skills in evaluating 
and handling the problems of the 
Justiciary. I kept him late one day 
and called him into my office 
when the others were gone. ‘There 
is this drug of Sumara Borthan,” I 
said, “that allows one mind freely 
to enter another.” He smiled and 
said that he had heard of it, yes, but 
understood it was difficult to ob- 
tain and dangerous to use. “There 
is no danger,” 1 answered. “And as 
for the difficulty of obtaining 
it — ” I drew forth one of my little 
packets. His smile did not fade, 
though dots of color came into his 
cheeks. We took the drug together 
in my office. Hours later, when we 
left for our homes, I gave him some 
so that he could take it with his 
wife. 

I N THE Stone Chapel I dared to 
reach out to a stranger, a short, 
thickbodied man in princely 
clothes, possibly a member of the 
septarch’s family. He had the clear 
serene eyes of a man of good faith 
and the poise of one who has 
looked within himself and is not 
displeased by what he has seen. 
But when 1 spoke my words to him 
he shoved me away and cursed me 



126 



GALAXY 




with such fury that his anger be- 
came contagious; maddened by his 
words, I nearly struck him in blind 
frenzy. “ Selfbar er! Selfbarer !’’ 
The shout echoed through the holy 
building, and people emerged 
from rooms of meditation to stare. 
It was the worst shame I had 
known in years. My exalted 
mission came into another per- 
spective: 1 saw it as filthy and my- 
self as something pitiful, a 
creeping slinking fog of a man 
driven by who knew what compul- 
sion to expose his shabby soul to 
strangers. My anger drained from 
me and fear flowed in: I slipped 
into the shadows and out by a side 
door, dreading arrest. For a week 
I walked on tiptoe, forever look- 
ing back over my shoulder. But 
nothing pursued me except my 
panging conscience. 



T HE time of insecurity passed. 

Again I saw my mission whole, 
recognized the merit of what I had 
pledged myself to do and felt only 
sorrow for the man in the Stone 
Chapel who had spurned my gift. 
And in a single week I found three 
strangers who would share the drug 
with me. I wondered how I ever 
could have doubted myself. But 
other seasons of doubt lay ahead. 

I TRIED to arrive at a theoreti- 
cal basis for my use of the 

A TIME OF CHANGES 



drug, to construct a new theology 
of love and openness. I studied the 
Covenant and many of its 
commentaries, attempting to dis- 
cover why the first settlers of 
Velada Borthan had found it 
necessary to deify mistrust and 
concealment. What did they fear? 
What were they hoping to 
preserve? Dark men in a dark time, 
with mindsnakes creeping through 
their skulls. In the end I came to no 
real understanding of them. They 
were convinced of their own 
virtue. They had acted for the best. 
Thou shalt not thrust the inward- 
ness of thy soul upon thy fellow 
man. Thou shalt not unduly 
examine needs of thine own self. 
Thou shalt deny thyself the easy 
pleasures of intimate conversa- 
tion. Thou shalt stand alone be- 
fore thy gods. And so we had lived, 
these hundreds of years, un- 
questioning, obedient, keeping the 
Covenant. Maybe nothing keeps 
the Covenant alive now, for most 
of us, except simple politeness: we 
are unwilling to embarrass others 
by baring ourselves and so we go 
locked up, our inner wounds fester- 
ing, and we speak our language of 
third-person courtliness. Was it 
time to create a new Covenant? A 
bond of love, a testament of 
sharing? Hidden in my rooms at 
home, I struggled to write one. 
What could I say that would be be- 
lieved? That we had done well 
enough following the old ways, but 

127 




at grievous personal cost. That the 
perilous conditions of the first 
settling no longer obtained among 
us and certain customs, having be- 
come handicaps rather than 
assets, could be discarded. That 
societies must evolve if they are not 
to decay. That love is better than 
hate and trust is better than mis- 
trust. But little of what I wrote con- 
vinced even me. Why was I 
attacking the established order of 
things? Out of profound con- 
viction, or merely out of the hunger 
for dirty pleasures? I was a man of 
my own time; I was embedded 
firmly in the rock of my up- 
bringing even as 1 toiled to turn 
that rock to sand. Trapped in the 
tension between my old beliefs 
and my still unformed new ones, 1 
swung a thousand times a day 
from pole to pole, from shame to 
exaltation. As I labored over the 
draft of my new Covenant's 
preamble one evening, my bond- 
sister Halum unexpectedly 
entered my study. 

“What are you writing?” she 
asked pleasantly. 

I covered one sheet with anoth- 
er. My face must have reflected 
my discomfort, for hers showed 
signs of apology for having in- 
truded. 

“Official reports,” I said. “Fool- 
ishness. Dull bureaucratic trivia.” 

That night 1 burned all I had 
written, in a paroxysm of self-con- 
tempt. 



I N THOSE weeks I took many 
voyages of exploration into un- 
known lands. Friends, strangers, 
casual acquaintances, a mistress: 
companions on strange journeys. 
But through all the early phase of 
my time of changes I said not a 
word to Halum about the drug. To 
share it with her had been my 
original goal, that had brought the 
drug to my lips in the first place. 
Yet 1 feared to approach her. It 
was cowardice that kept me back: 
what if, by coming to know me too 
well, she ceased to love me? 

S EVERAL times I came close to 
broaching the subject with her. I 
held myself back. I did not dare to 
move toward her. If you wish you 
may measure my sincerity by my 
hesitation; how pure, you may 
ask, was my new creed of open- 
ness if I felt that my bondsister 
would be above such a com- 
munion? But I will not pretend 
there was any consistency in my 
thinking then. My liberation 
from the taboos on self-baring was 
a willed thing, not a natural evolu- 
tion, and I had constantly to battle 
against the old habits of ‘our 
custom. Though I talked in “I” 
and “me” with Schweiz and some 
of the others with whom I had 
shared the drug, I was never com- 
fortable in doing so. Vestiges of 
my broken bonds still crept to- 
gether to shackle me. I looked at 
Halum and knew that I loved her 



128 



GALAXY 




and told myself that the only way 
to fulfill that love was through the 
joining of her soul and mine — and 
in my hand was the powder that 
would join us. And I did not dare. 
And I did not dare. 

XVII 

T HE twelfth person with whom I 
shared the Sumaran drug was 
my bondbrother Noim. He was in 
Manneran to spend a week as my 
guest. Winter had come, bringing 
snow to Glin, hard rains to Salla 
and only fog to Manneran — 
northerners needed a little prod- 
ding to come to our warm prov- 
ince. I had not seen Noim since 
the summer before, when we had 
hunted together in the Huishtors. 
In this past year we had drifted 
apart somewhat; in a sense 
Schweiz had come to take Noim’s 
place in my life and I no longer 
had quite the same need for my 
bondbrother. 

Noim now was a wealthy land- 
owner in Salla, having come into 
the inheritance of the Condorit 
family as well as the lands of his 
wife’s kin. In manhood he had be- 
come plump, though not fat; his 
wit and cunning were not hidden 
deep beneath his new layers of 
flesh. He had a sleek, well-oiled 
look, with dark unblemished skin, 
full complacent lips and round sar- 
donic eyes. Little escaped his at- 
tention. Upon arriving at my house 



he surveyed me with great care, as 
though counting my teeth and the 
lines about my eyes and, after the 
formal bondbrotherly greetings, 
after the presentation of my gift 
and the one he had brought from 
Stirron, after we had signed the 
contract of host and guest, Noim 
said unexpectedly, “Are you in 
trouble, Kinnall?” 

“Why do you ask that?’' 

“Your face is sharper. You’ve 
lost weight. Your mouth — you 
hold it in a quirky grin that doesn’t 
announce a relaxed man within. 
Your eyes are red-rimmed and 
they don’t want to look directly in- 
to other eyes. Is anything wrong?” 
“These have been the happiest 
months of one’s life,” I said, a 
shade too vehemently, perhaps. 

Noim ignored my disclaimer. 
“Are you having problems with 
Loimel?” 

“She goes her way and one goes 
his own.” 

“Difficulties with the business of 
the Justiciary, then?” 

“Please, Noim, won’t you be- 
lieve that — ” 

“Your face has changes in- 
scribed in it,” he said. “Do you 
deny there have been changes in 
your life?” 

I shrugged. “And if so?” 
“Changes for the worse?” 

“One does not think so.” 

“You’re being evasive, Kinnall. 
Come: what’s a bondbrother for if 
not to share problems?” 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



129 




'There are no problems," I in- 
sisted. 

"Very well." And he let the mat- 
ter drop. But I saw him watching 
me that evening and again the next 
day at morning’s meal, studying 
me, probing me. 1 could never hide 
anything from him. We sat over 
blue wine and talked of the Sallan 
harvest, talked of Stirron's new 
program of reforming the tax 
structure, talked of the renewed 
tensions between Salla and Glin, 
the bloody border raids that had 
lately cost me the life of a sister. 
And all the while Noim watched 
me. Halum dined with us, we 
talked of our childhood and 
Noim watched me. He flirted with 
Loimel, but his eyes did not wan- 
der from me. The depth and in- 
tensity of his concern preyed on 
me. He would be asking questions 
of others, soon, trying to get from 
Halum or from Loimel some 
notion of what might be bothering 
me, and he might stir up trouble- 
some curiosities in them that way. I 
could not let him remain ignorant 
of the central experience of his 
bondbrother’s life. Late the sec- 
ond night, when everyone else had 
retired, 1 took Noim to my study, 
opened the secret place where I 
stored the white powder and asked 
him if he knew anything of the 
Sumaran drug. He claimed not to 
have hea rd of it. Briefly I 
described its effects to him. His 
expression darkened; he seemed 



to draw in on himself. "Do you 
use this stuff often?" he asked. 

"Eleven times thus far." 

"Eleven — why, Kinnall?" 

"To learn the nature of one’s 
own self, through sharing that self 
with others.” 

Noim laughed explosively: it was 
almost a snort. "Selfbaring, Kin- 
nall?" 

"One takes up odd hobbies in 
one’s middle years.” 

"And with whom have you 
played this game?” 

I said, "Their names don’t mat- 
ter. No one you would know. Peo- 
ple of Manneran, those with some 
adventure in their souls, those who 
are willing to take risks.” 

"Loimel?" 

Now it was my turn to snort. 
"Never! She knows nothing of this 
at all.” 

"Halum, then?” 

I shook my head. "One wishes 
one had the courage to approach 
Halum. So far one has concealed 
everything from her. One fears 
she’s too virginal, too easily 
shocked. It's sad, isn’t it, Noim, 
when one has to hide something as 
exciting as this, as wonderfully 
rewarding, from one’s bondsis- 
ter.” 

"From one's bondbrother too,” 
he observed testily. 

"You would have been told in 
time,” I said. "You would have 
been offered your chance to ex- 
perience the communion." 



130 



GALAXY 




His eyes flashed. “Do you think 
Td want it?” 

His deliberate obscenity earned 
only a faint smile from me. “One 
hopes one's bondbrother will share 
all of one’s experiences. At present 
the drug opens a gulf between us. 
One has gone again and again to a 
place you have never visited. Do 
you see, Noim?” 

N oim saw. He was tempted; he 
hovered at the edge of the abyss; 
he chewed his lips, tugged at his 
earlobes and everything that 
passed across his mind was as 
transparent to me as if we had al- 
ready shared the Sumaran powder. 
For my sake he was uneasy, know- 
ing that I had seriously strayed 
from the Covenant and might soon 
find myself in grave spiritual and 
legal trouble. For his own sake he 
was gnawed by curiosity, aware 
that selfbaring with one’s bond- 
brother was no great sin and half- 
eager to know the kind of com- 
munion he might have with me un- 
der the drug. Also his eyes re- 
vealed a glint of jealousy that I had 
bared myself to this one and this 
one and that — unimportant stran- 
gers — and not to him. I tell you 
that I comprehended these things 
at that moment, though I con- 
firmed them later when Noim’s 
soul was open to me. 

We said nothing to one another 
about these matters for several 
days. We visited with Schweiz, 



emptied many a flask of good wine 
and discussed religious topics in a 
hearty, earnest, drunken way. 
(“All my life,” said Schweiz, “has 
been a quest for plausible reasons 
to believe in what I know to be ir- 
rational.”) Noim noticed that 
Schweiz did not always observe 
the grammatical niceties. Anoth- 
er night we dined with a group of 
Mannerangi nobles in a volup- 
tuous house in the hills overlook- 
ing the city: small birdlike men, 
overdressed and fidgety, with 
huge, handsome young wives. 
Noim was displeased by these ef- 
fete dukes and barons, with their 
talk of commerce and jewelry, but 
he grew more irritable yet when 
the chatter turned to the rumor 
that a mind-unsealing drug from 
the southern continent was now 
procurable in the capital. To this I 
made only polite interjections of 
surprise; Noim glared at me for 
my hypocrisy and even refused a 
dish of tender Mannerangi brandy, 
so tight-strung were his nerves. 

A sizzling tension was building 
in Noim during these days, for he 
clearly longed to return to the sub- 
ject of our early conversation, yet 
could not bring himself to it. 1 
made no move toward reopening 
the theme. It was Noim who made 
the move, finally, on the eve of his 
departure for his home in Salla. 

“This drug of yours — ” he be- 
gan hoarsely. 

He said he felt he could not

131 




regard himself as my true bond- 
brother unless he sampled it. These 
words came from him at great cost. 
His elegant clothes were rumpled 
by his restlessness and a fine line 
of beaded perspiration stood out 
on his upper lip. We went to a 
room where no one could intrude 
and I prepared the potion. As he 
took the flask he briefly flashed at 
me his familiar grin, impudent and 
sly and bold, but his hand was 
shaking so badly he nearly spilled 
the drink. 

The drug took effect quickly for 
both of us. It was a night of thick 
humidity. A dense greasy mist 
covered the city and its suburbs and 
it seemed to me that fingers of it 
were sliding into our room 
through the partly opened window: 
I saw shimmering, pulsating 
strands of cloud groping at us, 
dancing between my bondbrother 
and myself. The early sensations 
of druggedness disturbed Noim, 
until I explained that everything 
was normal, the twinned heart- 
beats, the cottony head, the high 
whining sounds in the air. Now we 
were open. I looked into Noim 
and saw not only his self but his 
image of his self, encrusted with 
shame and self-contempt; there 
was in Noim a fierce and burning 
loathing of his imagined flaws — 
and the flaws were many. He held 
himself accused of laziness, lack 
of discipline and ambition, ir- 
religiousness, a casual concern 



with high obligations and physi- 
cal and moral weakness. Why he 
saw himself in this way I could 
not understand, for the true Noim 
was there beside the image and 
the true Noim was a tough- 
minded man, loyal to those he 
loved, harsh in judgment of folly, 
clear-sighted, passionate, ener- 
getic. The contrast between 
Noim’s Noim and the world’s was 
startling: it was as though he were 
capable of correctly evaluating 
everything but his own worth. I 
had seen such disparities before on 
these drug voyages; in fact they 
were universal in all but Schweiz, 
who had not been trained from 
childhood in self-denial; yet they 
were sharper in Noim than in any- 
one else. 

Also I saw, as I had seen before, 
my own image refracted through 
Noim’s sensibility: a far nobler 
Kinnall Darival than I recognized. 
How he idealized me! I was all he 
hoped to be, a man of action and 
valor, a wielder of power, an 
enemy of everything that was 
frivolous, a practitioner of the 
sternest inner discipline and de- 
votion. Yet this image bore traces 
of a new overlay of tarnish, for 
was I not also now a Covenant- 
defiling selfbarer, who had done 
this and this and that and that 
with eleven strangers and who now 
had lured his own bondbrother 
into criminal experimentation? 
Noim also found in me the true 



132

depth of my feelings for Halum 
and upon making that discovery, 
which confirmed old suspicions, 
he altered his image of me once 
again, not for the better. Mean- 
while I showed Noim how 1 had al- 
ways seen him — quick, clever, cap- 
able — and showed him, too, his 
own Noim and the objective Noim 
as well, while he gave me a view of 
the. selves of mine he now could see 
beside that idealized Kinnall. 
These mutual explorations con- 
tinued a long time. 1 thought the 
exchanges were' immensely valu- 
able, since only with Noim could I 
attain the necessary depth of per- 
spective, the proper parallax of 
character, and he only with me; we 
had great advantages over a pair 
of strangers meeting for the first 
time by way of the Sumaran drug. 
When the spell of the potion be- 
gan to lift, I felt myself ex- 
hausted by the intensity of our 
communion, yet ennobled, exalt- 
ed, transformed. 

Not so Noim. He looked 
depleted and chilled. He could 
barely lift his eyes to mine. His 
mood was so frigid that I dared not 
break in on it but remained still, 
waiting for him to recover. 

At length he asked, “Is it all 
over?” 

“Yes.” 

“Promise one thing, Kinnall. 
Will you promise?” 

“Say it, Noim.” 

“That you never do this thing 



with Halum! Is it a promise? Will 
you promise it, Kinnall? Never. 
Never. Never.” 

S EVERAL days after Noim's de- 
parture some guilty impulse 
drove me to the Stone Chapel. To 
fill the time until Jidd could see 
me, I roamed the halls and byways 
of the dark building, pausing at 
altars, bowing humbly to half- 
blind scholars of the Covenant 
holding debate in a courtyard, 
brushing away ambitious minor 
drainers who, recognizing me, 
solicited my trade. All about me 
were the things of the gods, and 1 
failed to detect the divine pres- 
ence. Perhaps Schweiz had found 
the godhood through the souls of 
other men, but I, dabbling in self- 
baring, somehow had lost that 
other faith and it did not matter to 
me. I knew that in time I would 
find my way back to grace under 
this new dispensation of love and 
trust that I hoped to offer. So I 
lurked in the godhouse of god- 
houses, a mere tourist. 

I went to Jidd. I had not had a 
draining since immediately 
after Schweiz first had given me 
the Sumaran drug. The little 
crooknosed man remarked on 
that as I took the contract from 
him. The pressures of the Just- 
iciary, I explained, and he shook 
his head and made a chiding 
sound. “You must be full to over- 
flowing,” Jidd said. I did not

133 




reply, but settled down before his 
mirror to peer at the lean, un- 
familiar face that dwelled in it. He 
asked me which god I would have 
and I told him the god of the in- 
nocent. He gave me a queer look at 
that. The holy lights came on. With 
soft words he guided me into the 
half-trance of confession. What 
could 1 say? That I had ignored my 
pledge and gone on to use the self- 
baring potion with everyone who 
would take it from me? 1 sat silent. 
Jidd prodded me. He did some- 
thing I had never known a drainer 
to do before: hearkened back to a 
previous draining and asked me 
to speak again of this drug whose 
use I had admitted earlier. Had 1 
used it again? I pushed my face 
close to the mirror, fogging it 
with my breath. Yes. Yes. One is a 
miserable sinner and one has been 
weak once more. Then Jidd asked 
me how I had obtained this drug 
and 1 said that I had taken it, the 
first time, in company with one 
who had purchased it from a man 
who had been to Sumara Borthan. 
Yes, Jidd said, and what was the 
name of this companion? That 
was a clumsy move: immediately 
I was on guard. It seemed to me 
that Jidd’s question went far be- 
yond the needs of a draining. I re- 
fused therefore to give him 
Schweiz 1 name, which led the 
drainer to ask me, a little rough- 
ly, if I feared he would breach the 
secrecy of the ritual. 



Did I fear that? On rare occas- 
ions I had held things back from 
drainers out of shame, but never 
out of fear of betrayal. Naive I 
was and I had full faith in the ethics 
of the godhouse. Only now, sud- 
denly suspicious, the suspicion 
having been planted by Jidd him- 
self, did I mistrust Jidd and all his 
tribe. Why did he want to know? 
What information was he after? 
What could I gain, or he, by my re- 
vealing my source of the.drug? 

I replied tautly, “One seeks for- 
giveness for oneself alone and 
how can telling the name of one's 
companion bring that. Let him to 
his own confessing. 11 But of 
course there was no chance that 
Schweiz would go to a drainer; 
thus I had come down to playing 
word games with Jidd. All value 
had leaked from this draining, 
leaving me with an empty husk. 

“If you would have peace from 
the gods, 11 Jidd said, “you must 
speak your soul fully. 11 

How could I do that? Confess 
the seduction of eleven people 
into selfbaring? I had no need of 
Jidd’s forgiveness. I had no faith 
in his good will. Abruptly I stood 
up, a little dizzy from kneeling in 
the dark, swaying a bit, almost 
stumbling. 

“One is not ready for draining 
today,” I told Jidd. “One must ex- 
amine one’s soul more closely.” I 
lurched toward the door. He 
looked in a puzzled manner at the 



134 



GALAXY 




money I had given him. 

“The fee?” he called. I told him 
he could keep it. 

T HE days became mere vacant 
rooms, separating one journey 
with the drug from the next. I 
drifted idle and detached through 
all my responsibilities, seeing 
nothing of what was around me, 
living only for my next commun- 
ion. The real world dissolved; I 
lost interest in sex, wine, food, the 
doings of the Port Justiciary, the 
friction between neighboring prov- 
inces of Velada Borthan and all 
other such things, which to me 
now were only the shadows of 
shadows. Possibly I was using the 
drug too frequently. 1 lost weight 
and existed in a perpetual haze of 
blurred white light. I had diffi- 
culties in sleeping and for hours 
found myself twisting and shifting, 
a blanket of muggy tropical air 
clamping me to my mattress, a 
haggard insomniac with an ache 
in his eyeballs and grittiness un- 
der the lids. I walked tired 
through my days and blinking 
through my evenings. Rarely did 
I speak with Loimel, nor did I 
touch her, and hardly ever did 1 
touch any other woman. I fell 
asleep at midday once while lunch- 
ing with Halum. I scandalized 
High Justice Kalimol by replying 
to one of his questions with the 
ph rase, “It seems to me—” Old 
Segvord Helalam told me I looked 



ill and suggested I go hunting 
with my sons in the Burnt Low- 
lands. Nevertheless the drug had 
the power of bringing me alive. I 
sought out new sharers and found it 
ever more easy to make contact 
with them, for often now they were 
brought to me by those who had al- 
ready made the inner voyage. An 
odd group they were: two dukes, a 
marquis, a whore, a keeper of the 
royal archives, a sea captain in 
from Glin, a septarch’s mistress, 
a director of the Commercial and 
Seafarer’s Bank of Manneran, a 
poet, a lawyer from Velis here to 
confer with Captain Khrisch, and 
many more. The circle of self- 
barers was widening. My supply 
of the drug was nearly consumed, 
but now there was talk among 
some of my new friends of outfitt- 
ing a new expedition to Sumara 
Borthan. There were fifty of us by 
this time. Change was becoming 
infectious; there was an epidemic 
of it in Manneran. 

S OMETIMES, unexpectedly, in 
the blank dead time between one 
communion and another, I under- 
went a strange confusion of the 
self. A block of borrowed exper- 
ience that I had stowed in the dark 
depths of my mind might break 
loose and float up into the higher 
levels of consciousness, intrud- 
ing itself into my own identity. I 
remained aware of being Kinnall 
Darival, the septarch’s son of 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



135 




Salla, yet there was suddenly 
among my memories a segment 
of the self of Noim, or Schweiz, or 
one of the Sumarnu, or someone 
else of those with whom I had 
shared the drug. For the length of 
that splicing of selves — a moment, 
an hour, half a day — I walked 
about unsure of my past, unable 
to determine whether some event 
fresh in my mind had really be- 
fallen me or had come to me 
through the drug. This was dis- 
turbing but not really frightening, 
except the first two or three times. 
Eventually I learned to distin- 
guish the quality of these unearned 
memories from that of my gen- 
uine past through familiarity with 
the textures of each. The drug had 
made me many people, I realized. 
Was it not better to be many than 
to be something less than one? 

XVIII 

I N EARLY spring a lunatic heat 
settled over Manneran, coupled 
with such frequent rains that all the 
city’s vegetation went mad and 
would have swallowed every street 
if not given a daily hacking. It was 
green, green, green, everywhere: 
green haze in the sky, green rain 
falling, green sunlight sometimes 
breaking through, broad glossy 
green leaves unfurling on every 
balcony and in every garden plot. 
A man’s own soul can mildew in 
that. Green, too, were the awnings 



on the street of the spice-mer- 
chants’ shops. Loimel had given me 
a long list of things to purchase, 
delicacies from Threish and Velis 
and the Wet Lowlands and in a 
docile husbandly way I went to 
obtain them, since the street of 
spice was only a short walk from 
the Justiciary. She was mounting 
a grand feast to celebrate the 
Naming Day of our eldest daugh- 
ter, who was at last going to come 
into the adult-name we had in- 
tended for her: Loimel. All the 
great ones of Manneran had been 
invited to look on as my wife ac- 
quired a namesake. Among the 
guests would be several who had 
covertly sampled the Sumaran 
drug with me and I took private 
pleasure in that; Schweiz, though, 
had not been invited, since Loimel 
deemed him coarse. In any event, 
he had left Manneran on some 
business trip just as the weather 
was beginning to go berserk. 

I moved through the greenness 
to the best of the shops. A recent 
rain had ended and the sky was a 
flat green plaque resting on the 
rooftops. To me came delicious 
fragrances, sweetnesses, pungen- 
cies, clouds of tongue-tickling 
flavors. Abruptly there were black 
bubbles coursing through my skull 
and for a moment I was Schweiz 
haggling on a pier with a skipper 
who had just brought a cargo of 
costly produce in from the Gulf of 
Sumar. I halted to enjoy this 



136

tangling of selves. Schweiz faded; 
through Noim’s mind 1 smelled the 
scent of newly threshed hay on the 
Condorit estates, under a delici- 
ous latesummer sun. As I stood 
gaping outside the spice-shop, a 
thin hand fell on mine and a guard- 
ed voice said, “I must talk to you 
secretly, Kinnall.” /. The word 
jolted me from my dreaming. 

Androg Mihan, keeper of the 
archives of Manneran’s prime 
septarch, stood beside me. He 
was a small man, sharp-featured 
and gray, the last you would think 
to seek illegal pleasures; the Duke 
of Sumar, one of my early con- 
quests, had led him to me. “Where 
shall we go?” I asked and Mihan 
indicated a disreputable-looking 
lower-class godhouse across the 
street. 

Its drainer lounged outside, try- 
ing to stir up business. I could not 
see how we could talk secretly in a 
godhouse, but I followed the 
archivist anyway; we entered the 
godhouse and Mihan told the 
drainer to fetch his contract 
forms. The moment the man was 
gone, Mihan leaned close to me 
and said, “The police are on their 
way to your house. When you re- 
turn home this evening you will be 
arrested and taken to prison on 
one of the Sumar Gulf s isles.” 

“Where do you learn this?” 

“The decree was verified this 
morning and has passed to me for 
filing.” 

A TIME OF CHANGES 



“What charge?” 1 asked. 
“Selfbaring," Mihan said. “Ac- 
cusation filed by agents of the 
Stone Chapel. There is also a se- 
cular charge: use and distribu- 
tion of illegal drugs. They have 
you, Kinnall.” 

“Who is the informer?” 

“A certain Jidd, said to be a 
drainer in the Stone Chapel. Did 
you let the tale of the drug be 
drained from you?” 

“I did. In my innocence. The 
sanctity of the godhouse — ” 

“The sanctity of the dung- 
house,” Androg Mihan said vehe- 
mently. “Now you must flee! The 
full force of the government is 
mustered against you.” 

“Where shall I go?” 

“The Duke of Sumar will shelter 
you tonight,” said Mihan. “After 
that — I do not know.” 

The drainer now returned, bear- 
ing a set of contracts. He gave us a 
proprietary smile and said, “Well, 
gentlemen, which of you is to be 
first?” 

“One has remembered another 
appointment,” Mihan said. 

“One feels suddenly unwell,” I 
said. 

I tossed the startled drainer a fat 
coin and we left the godhouse. 
Outside, Mihan pretended not to 
know me and we went our separate 
ways without a word. Not for a 
moment did I doubt the truth of 
his warning. I had to take flight; 
Loimel would have to purchase 

137 




her own spices. I hailed a car and 
went at once to the mansion of the 
DukeofSumar. 

ipHIS duke is one of the wealth- 
* iest in Manneran, with sprawl- 
ing estates along the gulf and in 
the Huishtor foothills and a 
splendid home at the capital set 
amid a park worthy of an em- 
peror’s palace. He is hereditary 
customs-keeper of Stroin Gap, 
which is the source of his family’s 
opulence, since for centuries they 
have skimmed a share of all that is 
brought forth to market out of the 
Wet Lowlands. In his person this 
duke is a man of great ugliness or 
remarkable beauty, I am not sure 
which: he has a large flat trian- 
gular head, thin lips, a powerful 
nose and strange dense tightly 
curled hair that clings like a carpet 
to his skull. His hair is entirely 
white, yet his face is unlined. His 
eyes are huge and dark and in- 
tense. His cheeks are hollow. It is 
an ascetic face, which to me al- 
ways seemed alternately saintly 
and monstrous and sometimes 
the both at once. I had been close 
with him almost since my arrival 
in Manneran so many years be- 
fore; he had helped Segvord 
Helalam into power and he had 
stood soulbinder to Loimel at our 
wedding ceremony. When I took 
up the use of the Sumaran drug, he 
divined it as if by telepathy. In a 
conversation of marvelous sub- 



tlety he learned from me that I had 
the drug and arranged that he 
should take it with me. That had 
been four moonrises earlier, in late 
winter. 

Arriving at his home, I found a 
tense conference in progress. 
Present were most of the men of 
consequence whom I had in- 
veigled into my circle of self- 
barers. The Duke of Mannerangu 
Smor. The Marquis of Woyn. The 
bank director. The Commission- 
er of the Treasury and his brother, 
the Procurator-General of Man- 
neran. The Master of the Border. 
And five or six others of similar 
significance. Archivist Mihan ar- 
rived shortly after I did. 

“We are all here now,” the Duke 
of Mannerangu Smor said. 
“They could sweep us up with a 
single stroke. Are the grounds well 
guarded?” 

“No one will invade us,” said the 
Duke of Sumar, a trifle icily, clear- 
ly offended by the suggestion 
that common police might burst 
into his home. He turned his huge 
alien eyes on me. “Kinnall, this will 
be your last night in Manneran, 
and no help for it. You are to be the 
scapegoat.” 

“By whose choice?” I asked. 

“Not ours,” the duke replied. He 
explained that something close to 
a coup d’etat had been attempted 
in Manneran this day and might 
well yet succeed: a revolt of jun- 
ior bureaucrats against their mas.- 



138

ters. The beginning, he said, lay in 
my having admitted my use of the 
Sumaran drug to the drainer Jidd. 
(Around the room faces darkened. 
The unspoken implication was 
that 1 had been a fool to trust a 
drainer and now must pay the price 
of my folly, I had not been as 
sophisticated as these men.) Jidd, 
it seemed, had leagued himself 
with a cabal of disaffected minor 
officials, hungry for their turn at 
power. Since he was drainer to 
most of the great men of Manner- 
an, he was in an extraordinarily 
good position to aid the ambi- 
tious, by betraying the secrets of 
the mighty. Why Jidd had chosen 
to contravene his oaths in this fash- 
ion was not yet known. The Duke 
of Sumar suspected that in Jidd 
familiarity had bred contempt 
and, after listening for years to the 
melancholy outpourings of his 
powerful clients, he had grown to 
loathe them: exasperated by their 
confessions, he found pleasure in 
collaborating in their destruc- 
tion. (This gave me a new view of 
what a drainer’s soul might be 
like.) Hence Jidd had, for some 
months now, been slipping useful 
facts to rapacious subordinates, 
who had threatened their masters 
with them, often to considerable 
effect. By admitting my use of 
the drug to him, I had made my- 
self vulnerable, and he had sold 
me to certain folk of the Justr 
iciary wishing me out of office. 



“But this is absurd!” 1 cried. 
“The only evidence against me is 
protected by the sanctity of the 
godhouse! How can Jidd place a 
complaint against me based on 
what I’ve drained to him? I'll have 
him up on charges for violation of 
contract!” 

“There is other evidence,” the 
Marquis of Woyn said sadly. 

“There is?” 

“Using what he heard from your 
own lips,” the Marquis said, “Jidd 
was able to guide your enemies into 
channels of investigation. They 
have found a certain woman who 
lives in the hovels behind the 
Stone Chapel, who had admitted 
to them that you gave her a strange 
drink that opened her mind to 
you — ” 

“The beasts.” 

“They have also,” the Duke of 
Sumar said, “been able to link sev- 
eral of us to you. Not all, but sev- 
eral. This morning some of us 
were presented, by their own sub- 
ordinates, by demands to resign 
their offices or face exposure. We 
met these threats firmly and those 
who made them are now under de- 
tention, but there is no telling 
how many allies they have in high 
places. It is possible that by next 
moonrise we will all have been 
cast down and new men will hold 
our power. However, I doubt this, 
since, so far as we can determine, 
the only solid evidence so far is the 
confession of the slut, who has

139 




implicated only you, Kinnall. The 
accusations made by Jidd will of 
course be inadmissible, though 
they can do damage anyway.'” 

“We can destroy her credibil- 
ity, ” I said. "I'll claim I never 
knew her. I — ” 

"Too late,” said the Procura- 
tor-General. "Her deposition is 
on record. Tve had a copy from 
the Grand Justiciar. It will stand 
up. You’re hopelessly impli- 
cated.” 

"What will happen?” I asked. 
"We will crush the ambitions of 
the blackmailers,” said the Duke 
of Sumar, "and send them into 
poverty. We will break Jidd’s pres- 
tige and drive him from the Stone 
Chapel. We will deny all of the 
charges of selfbaring that may be 
brought against us. You, however, 
must leave Manneran.” 

"Why?” I looked at the duke in 
perplexity. "I’m not without in- 
fluence. If you can withstand the 
charges, why not I?” 

"Your guilt is on record,” the 
Duke of Mannerangu Smor said. 
"If you flee, it can be claimed that 
you alone — and this girl you cor- 
rupted — were the only ones in- 
volved and that the rest is merely 
the fabrication of self-serving 
underlings trying to overthrow 
their masters. If you stay and try 
to fight a hopeless case, you’ll 
eventually bring us all down.” 

It was wholly plain to me now. 

I was dangerous to them. My 



strength might be broken in court 
and their guilt thus exposed. Thus 
far I was the only one indicted, 
and I was the only one vulnerable 
to the processes of Mannerangi 
justice. They were vulnerable sole- 
ly through me, and if I went, there 
was no way to getting at them. 
The safety of the majority re- 
quired my departure. Moreover: 
my naive faith in the godhouse, 
which had led me rashly to con- 
fess to Jidd, had led to this temp- 
est, which otherwise might have 
been avoided. I had caused all this; 
I was the one who must go. 

The Duke of Sumar said, "You 
will remain with us until the dark 
hours of the night. Then my pri- 
vate groundcar, escorted by 
bodyguards as though I myself 
were traveling, will take you to the 
estate of the Marquis of Woyn. A 
riverboat will be waiting there. By 
dawn you will be across the Woyn 
and into your homeland of 
Salla — and may the gods journey 
at your side.” 

O NCE more a refugee. All the 
power I had accumulated in 
fifteen years in Manneran was 
lost in a single day. Neither high 
birth nor high connections could 
save me: I might have ties of mar- 
riage or love or politics to half the 
masters of Manneran, yet they 
were helpless to help me. I have 
made it seem as if they had forced 
me into exile to save their own

skins, but it was not like that. My 
going was necessary and it 
brought as much sorrow to them 
as to me. The others had taken the 
drug, had adapted to the changes 
and now would be enhanced and 
transformed by it. And not in- 
jured. Not so with me. With me the 
drug had opened the doors of ruin. 
Why? Why? Some flaw in my fate, 
I suppose. Some darkness of my 
destiny. That I, a septarch’s son, 
should have taken up a creed of 
selfbaring — well, perhaps that 
demanded my downfall and not 
that of these other high ones. I have 
no idea. There is little justice. 

I had nothing with me but the 
clothes I wore. My wardrobe, my 
weapons, my ornaments, my 
wealth itself, must remain be- 
hind in Manneran. As a boy- 
prince fleeing from Salla to Glin, 1 
had had the 'prudence to transfer 
funds ahead of myself, but now I 
was cut off. My assets would be 
sequestered; my sons would be 
paupered. There had been no time 
for preparations. 

Here at least my friends were of 
service. The Procurator-Gen- 
eral, who was nearly of a size with 
me, had brought several changes 
of handsome clothing. The Com- 
missioner of the Treasury had ob- 
tained for me a fair fortune in 
Sallan currency. The Duke of 
Mannerangu Smor pulled two 
rings and a pendant from his own 
body, that I should not go 



unadorned into my native prov- 
ince. The Marquis of Woyn 
pressed on me a ceremonial dag- 
ger and his heat-rod, with a hilt 
worked with precious gems. 
Mihan promised to speak with 
Segvord Helalam and tell him the 
details of my downfall; Segvord 
would be sympathetic, Mihan be- 
lieved, and would protect my sons 
with all his influence and keep 
them untainted by their father’s 
indictment. Lastly, the Duke of 
Sumar came to me at the deepest 
time of the night — when I sat alone 
sourly eating the dinner I had 
had no time for earlier — and 
handed my a small jeweled case of 
bright gold, of the sort one might 
carry medicine in. “Open it care- 
fully,” he said. I did and found it 
brimming with white powder. In 
amazement I asked him where he 
had obtained this; he had lately 
sent agents secretly to Sumara 
Borthan, he replied, who had re- 
turned with a small supply of the 
drug. He claimed to have more, but 
I believe he gave me all he had. 

“In an hour’s time you will 
leave,” said the duke, to smother 
my gush of gratitude. 

I asked to be allowed to make a 
call first. 

“Segvord will explain matters to 
your wife,” the duke said. 

“One did not mean one's wife. 
One meant one’s bondsister.” In 
speaking of Halum I could not 
drop easily into the rough gram-

mar we selfbarers affected. “One 
has had no chance to make one’s 
farewell to her.’’ 

The duke understood my 
anguish, for her had been within 
my soul. But he would not grant 
me the call. Lines might be tapped; 
he could not risk having my voice 
go forth from his home this night. I 
realized then how delicate a posi- 
tion even he must be in and I did 
not force the issue. I could call 
Halum tomorrow, when I had 
crossed the Woyn and was safe in 
Salla. 

Shortly it was time for me to de- 
part. My friends had already gone 
some hours since; the duke alone 
led me from the house. His ma- 
gestic groundcar waited, and a 
corps of bodyguards on individ- 
ual powercycles. The duke em- 
braced me. I climbed into the car 
and settled back against the cush- 
ions. The driver opaqued the win- 
dows, hiding me from view, 
though not interfering with my 
own vision. The car rolled silently 
forward, picked up speed, plunged 
into the night, with my outriders, 
six of them, hovering about it like 
insects. It seemed that hours went 
by before we came even to the 
main gate of the duke’s estate. 
Then we were on the highway. I 
sat like a man carved of ice, scarce- 
ly thinking of what had befallen 
me. Northward lay our route and 
we went at such a rate that the sun 
was not yet up when we reached 



the margin of the Marquis of 
Woyn’s estate, on the border be- 
tween Manneran and Salla. The 
gate opened; we shot through; the 
road cut across a dense forest in 
which, by moonlight, I could see 
sinister parasitic growths like 
hairy ropes tangling tree to tree. 
Suddenly we erupted into a clear- 
ing and I beheld the banks of the 
River Woyn. The car halted. 

Someone in dark robes helped 
me out, as though I were a dod- 
derer, and escorted me down the 
spongy bank to a long narrow 
pier, barely visible in the thick 
mist rising off the breast of the 
river. A boat was tied up, no great 
craft, hardly more than a dinghy. 
Yet it traveled at great speeds 
across the broad and turbulent 
Woyn. Still I felt no inner re- 
sponse to my banishment from 
Manneran. I was like one who 
has gone forth in battle and had 
his right leg sliced off at the thigh 
by a fire-bold, and who now lies in 
a tumbled heap, staring calmly 
at his stump and sensing no pain. 
The pain would come in time. 

Dawn was near. I could make 
out the shape of the Sallan side of 
the river. We pulled up at a dock 
that jutted out of a grassy bank, 
plainly some nobleman’s private 
landing. Now I felt my first alarm. 
In a moment I would step ashore 
in Salla. Where would I find my- 
self? How would I reach some 
settled region? I was no boy, to 



142

beg rides from passing trucks. But 
all this had been settled for me 
hours before. As the boat bumped 
the shoulder of the pier a figure 
emerged in the dimness and ex- 
tended a hand: Noim. He drew me 
forth and clasped me in a tight hug. 
"1 know what has happened," he 
said. “You will stay with me.” In 
his emotion he abandoned polite 
usage with me for the first time 
since our boyhood. 

XIX 

A T MIDDAY, from Noim’s es- 
tate in southwestern Salla, I 
phoned the Duke of Sumar to con- 
firm my safe arrival —it was he, of 
course, who had arranged for my 
bondbrother to meet me at the 
border and then I put through a 
call to Halum. Segvord had told 
her just a few hours earlier of the 
reasons for my disappearance. 
“How strange this news is," she 
said. “You never spoke of the drug. 
Yet it was so important to you, for 
you risked everything to use it. 
How could it have had such a role 
in your life and yet be kept a secret 
from your bondsister?" I answer- 
ed that I had not dared to let her 
know of my preoccupation with 
it, for fear I might be tempted to 
offer it to her. She said, “Is open- 
ing yourself then to your bond- 
sister so terrible a sin?" 

Noim treated me with every 
courtesy, indicating that I could 



stay with him as long as I 
wished -weeks, months, even 
years. Presumably my friends in 
Manneran would succeed even- 
tually in freeing some of my as- 
sets and I would buy land in Salla 
and take up the life of a country 
baron; or perhaps Segvord and the 
Duke of Sumar and other men of 
influence would have my indict- 
ment quashed, so that I could re- 
turn to the southern province. 
Until then, Noim told me, his 
home was mine. But I detected a 
subtle coolness in his dealings 
with me, as if this hospitality 
were offered merely out of re- 
spect for our bonding. Only after 
some days did the source of his re- 
moteness reach the surface. Sit- 
ting late past dinner in his great 
white-washed feasting hall, we 
were talking of childhood days 
our main theme of conversation, 
far safer than any talk of recent 
events - when Noim suddenly 
said, “Is that drug of yours 
known • to give people night- 
mares?" 

“One has heard of no such cases, 
Noim." 

“Here’s a case, then. One who 
woke up drenched with chilly 
sweat night after night for weeks 
after we shared the drug in Man- 
neran. One thought one would lose 
one’s mind." 

“What kind of dreams?" I 
asked. 

“Ugly things. Monsters. Teeth.

Claws. A sense of not knowing 
who one is. Pieces of other minds 
floating through one’s own/’ He 
gulped at his wine. "You take the 
drug for pleasure, Kinnall?” 

"For knowledge.” 

"Knowledge of what?” 
"Knowledge of self and 
knowledge of others.” 

"One prefers ignorance, then.” 
He shivered. "You know, Kin- 
nall, one was never a particularly 
reverent person. One blas- 
phemed, one stuck his tongue out 
at drainers, one laughed at the god- 
tales they told, yes? You’ve nearly 
converted one into a man of faith 
with that stuff. The terror of open- 
ing one’s mind — of knowing that 
one has no defenses, that another 
can slide right into one’s soul and is 
doing it — it’s impossible to take.” 
"Impossible for you,” I said. 
"Others cherish it.” 

"One leans toward the Cov- 
enant,” said Noim. "Privacy is 
sacred. One’s soul is one’s own. 
There’s a dirty pleasure in baring 
it.” 

"Not baring. Sharing.” 

"Does it sound prettier that 
way? Very well: there’s a dirty 
pleasure in sharing it, Kinnall. 
Even though we are bondbrothers, 
one came away from you last time 
feeling soiled. Sand and grit in the 
soul. Is this what you want for 
everyone? To make us all feel 
filthy with guilt?” 

"There need be no guilt, Noim. 



One gives, one receives, one comes 
forth better than one was — ” 

"Dirtier.” 

"Enlarged. Enhanced. More 
compassionate. Speak to others 
who have tried it,” I said. 

"Of course. As they come 
streaming out of Manneran, land- 
less refugees, one will question 
them about the beauty and wonder 
of selfbaring. Excuse me: self- 
sharing.” 

I saw the torment in his eyes. He 
wanted still to love me, but the 
Sumaran drug had shown him 
things — about himself, perhaps 
about me — that made him hate the 
one who had given the drug to him. 
He was one for whom walls are 
necessary; I had not realized that. 
What had I done -to turn my 
bondbrother into my enemy? Per- 
haps if we could take the drug a 
second time I might make things 
more clear to him — but no, no 
hope of that. Noim was frightened 
by inwardness. I had trans- 
formed my blaspheming bond- 
brother into a man of the Cov- 
enant. There was nothing I could 
say to him now. 

After some silence he said, "One 
must make a request of you, Kin- 
nall.” 

"Anything.” 

"One hesitates to place 
boundaries on a guest. But if you 
have brought any of this drug with 
you from Manneran, Kinnall, if 
you hide it somewhere in your 



144 



GALAXY 




rooms — get rid of it, is that under- 
stood? There must be none of it in 
this house. Get rid of it, Kinnall.” 

Never in my life had I lied to my 
bondbrother. Never. 

With the jeweled case the Duke 
of Sumar had given me blazing 
against my breastbone I said 
solemnly to Noim, “You have 
nothing to fear on that account, 
Noim.” 

WOT many days later the news of 
** my disgrace became public in 
Manneran and swiftly reached 
Salla. Noim showed me the ac- 
counts. I was described as the 
chief adviser to the High Justice of 
the Port and openly labeled a 
man of the greatest authority in 
Manneran, who, moreover, had 
blood ties to the prime septarchs of 
Salla and Glin — and yet, despite 
these attainments and prefer- 
ments, I had fallen away from the 
Covenant to take up unlawful 
selfbaring. I had violated not 
merely propriety and etiquette, 
but also the laws of Manneran, 
through my use of a certain pro- 
scribed drug from Sumara Bor- 
than that dissolves the god-given 
barriers between soul and soul. 
Through abuse of my high office, 
it was said, I had engineered a 
secret voyage to the southern con- 
tinent (poor Captain Khrisch! 
Had he been arrested too?) and 
had returned with a large quantity 
of the drug, which I had devilishly 



forced on a lowborn woman whom 
1 was keeping; I had also cir- 
culated the foul stuff among cer- 
tain prominent members of the 
nobility, whose names were being 
withheld because of their 
thorough repentance. On the eve 
of my arrest I had escaped to 
Salla and good riddance to me: if I 
attempted to return to Man- 
neran I would immediately be ap- 
prehended. Meanwhile I would 
be tried in absentia and, accord- 
ing to the Grand Justiciar, there 
could be little doubt of the ver- 
dict. By way of restitution to the 
state for the great injury I had 
done the fabric of social stability, I 
would be required to forfeit all 
my lands and property, except 
only a portion to be set aside for 
the maintenance of my innocent 
wife and children. (Segvord 
Helalam, then, had at least ac- 
complished that.) To prevent my 
highborn friends from trans- 
ferring my assets to me in Salla 
before the trial, all that I 
possessed was already sequestered 
in anticipation of the Grand 
Justiciar’s decree of guilt. Thus 
spake the law. Let others who 
would make selfbaring monsters 
of themselves beware! 

I MADE no secret of my where- 
abouts in Salla, for I had no 
reason now to fear the jealousy of 
my royal brother. Stirron as a 
boy newly on the throne might 



ATIME OF CHANGES 



145 




have been driven to eliminate me 
as a potential rival, but not the 
Stirron who had ruled for more 
than seventeen years. By now he 
was an institution in Salla, well 
loved and an integral part of ev- 
eryone’s existence, and 1 was a 
stranger who spoke with a Man- 
nerangi accent and who had been 
publicly branded with the shame 
of selfbaring. Even if I cared to 
overthrow Stirron, where would 1 
find followers? 

In truth I was hungry for the 
sight of my brother. In times of 
storm one turns to one’s earliest 
comrades; and with Noim es- 
tranged from me and Halum on the 
far side of the Woyn, I had only 
Stirron left. I had never resented 
having had to flee Salla on his ac- 
count, for I knew that had our ages 
been reversed I would have caused 
him to flee the same way. If our re- 
latipnship had grown frosty since 
my flight, it was a frost of his mak- 
ing, arising from his guilty con- 
science. Years had passed since my 
last visit to Salla City: perhaps my 
adversities would open his heart. 
I wrote Stirron a letter from 
Noim’s place, formally begging 
sanctuary in Salla. Under Sallan 
law I had to be taken in, for I was 
one of Stirron’s subjects and was 
guilty of no crime committed on 
Sallan soil: yet I thought it best to 
ask. The charges lodged against me 
by the Grand Justiciar of Man- 
neran, I admitted, were true, but I 



offered Stirron a terse and (I 
think) eloquent justification of 
my deviation from the Covenant. 
I closed the letter with express- 
ions of my unwavering love for 
him and with a few reminiscences 
of the happy times we had had be- 
fore the burdens of the septarchy 
had descended on him. 

I expected Stirron in return to 
invite me to visit him at the cap- 
ital, so that he could hear from my 
own lips an explanation of the 
strange things I had done in Man- 
neran. A brotherly reunion was 
surely in order. But no summons 
to Salla City came. Each time the 
telephone chimed, I rushed to- 
ward it, thinking it might be Stir- 
ron calling. He did not call. Sev- 
eral weeks of tension and gloom 
passed; I hunted, I swam, I read, I 
tried to write my new Covenant of 
love. Noim remained aloof from 
me. His one experience at soul- 
sharing had thrust him into so 
deep an embarassment that he 
hardly dared to meet my eyes, for 
I was privy to all his innerness 
and that had become a wedge be- 
* tween us. 

At last came an envelope bearing 
the septarch’s imposing seal. It 
held a letter signed by 1 Stirron, but 
I pray it was some steely minister 
and not my brother, who com- 
posed that pinch-souled message. 
In fewer lines than I have fingers, 
the septarch told me that my re- 
quest for sanctuary in the province 



146 



, GALAXY 




of Salla was granted, but only on 
the condition that I forswear the 
vices I had learned in the south. If I 
were caught just once spreading 
the use of selfbaring drugs in 
Salla I would be seized and driven 
into exile. That was all my brother 
had to say. Not a syllable of kind- 
ness. Not a shred of sympathy. Not 
an atom of warmth. 

A T THE crest of the summer 
L Halum came unexpectedly to 
visit us. The day of her arrival I 
had gone riding far out across 
Noim's land, following the track 
of a male stormshield that had 
burst from its pen. An accursed 
vanity had led Noim to acquire a 
clutch of these vicious furbearing 
manmals, though they are not na- 
tive to Salla and thrive poorly 
there: he kept twenty or thirty of 
them, all claws and teeth and angry 
yellow eyes, and hoped to breed 
them into a profitable herd. I 
chased the escaped male through 
woods and plain, through morning 
and midday, hating it more with 
each hour, for it left a trail of 
mutilated carcasses of harmless 
grazing beasts. These storm- 
shields kill for sheer love of 
slaughter, taking but a bite or two 
of flesh and abandoning the rest to 
scavengers. Finally I cornered it 
in a shadowy box-canyon. "Stun it 
and bring it back whole," Noim 
had instructed me, conscious of 
the animals value: but when 



trapped it rushed at me with such 
ferocity that I gave it the full beam 
and gladly slew it. For Noim’s 
sake I took the trouble to strip 
off the precious hide. Then, weary 
and depressed, I rode without 
stopping back to the great house. 
A strange groundcar was parked 
outside and beside it stood 
Halum. 

"You know the summers in 
Manneran," she explained. "One 
planned to go as usual to the is- 
land, but then one thought it would 
be good to take a holiday in Salla 
with Noim and Kinnall." 

She had by then entered her 
thirtieth year. Our women marry 
between fourteen and sixteen, are 
done bearing their children by 
twenty-two or twenty-four and at 
thirty have begun to slide into 
middle age, but time had left 
Halum untouched. Not having 
known the tempests of marriage 
and the travails of motherhood, 
not. having spent her energies on 
the grapplings of the conjugal 
couch or the lacerations of child- 
bed, she had the supple, pliant body 
of a girl: no fleshy bulges, no sag- 
ging folds, no exploded veins, no 
thickening of the frame. She had 
changed only in one respect, for in 
recent years her dark hair had 
turned silvery. This was but an en- 
hancement, however, since it 
gleamed with dazzling brilliance 
and offered agreeable contrast to 
the deep tan of her youthful face.

In her luggage was a packet of 
letters for me from Manneran: 
messages from the duke, from 
Segvord, from my sons Noim and 
Stirron and Kinnall, from my 
daughters Halum and Loimel, 
from Mihan the archivist, and sev- 
eral others. Those who wrote did so 
in tense, self-conscious style. They 
were the letters one might write to 
a dead man if one felt guilty at hav- 
ing survived him. Still, it was good 
to hear these words out of my 
former life. I regretted not find- 
ing a letter from Schweiz; Halum 
told me she had heard nothing 
from him since before my indict- 
ment and thought he might well 
have left our planet. Nor was there 
any word from my wife. “Is Loi- 
mel too busy to write a line or 
two?” I asked and Halum, looking 
embarrassed, said softly that 
Loimel never spoke of me these 
days: “She seems to have forgot- 
ten that she was married.” 

Halum also had brought a trove 
of gifts for me from my friends 
across the Woyn. They were start- 
ling in their opulence: massy 

clusters of precious metals, ela- 
borate strings of rare gems. 
“Tokens of love,” Halum said, but 
I was not fooled. One could buy 
great estates with this heap of 
treasure. Those who loved me 
would not humiliate me by trans- 
ferring cash to my account in 
Salla, but they could give me these 
splendors in the ordinary way of 



friendship, leaving me free to dis- 
pose of them according to my 
needs. 

“Has it been very sad for you, 
this uprooting?” Halum asked. 
“This sudden going into exile?” 
“One is no stranger to exile,” I 
told her. “And one still has Noim 
for bondlove and companion- 
ship.” 

“Knowing that it would cost you 
what it did,” she said, “would you 
play with the drug a second time, 
if you could turn time backward 
by a year?” 

“Beyond any doubt.” 

“Was it worth the loss of home 
and family and friends?” 

“It would be worth the loss of 
life itself,” I replied, “if only one 
could be assured by that that all 
of Velada Borthan would come 
to taste the drug.” 

T HAT answer seemed to frighten 
her: she drew back, she touched 
the tips of her fingers to her lips, 
perhaps becoming aware for the 
first time of the intensity of her 
bondbrother’s madness. In speak- 
ing those words I was not uttering 
mere rhetorical overstatement, 
and something of my conviction 
must have reached Halum. She saw 
that I believed and, seeing the 
depth of my committment, feared 
for me. 

Noim spent many of the days 
that followed away from his lands, 
traveling to Salla City on some 



148

family business and to the Plain 
of Nand to inspect property he 
was thinking of buying. In his ab- 
sence I was master of the estate, 
for the servants, whatever they 
might think of my private life, did 
not dare to question my authority 
to my face. Daily I rode out to 
oversee the workers in NoinTs 
fields and Halum rode with me. 
Actually little overseeing was de- 
manded of me. This was midway 
in the seasons between planting 
and harvest and the crops looked 
after themselves. We rode for 
pleasure mainly, pausing here 
for a swim, there for a lunch at the 
edge of the woods. I showed her the 
stormshield pens, which did not 
please her, and took her among the 
gentler animals of the grazing 
fields, who came up and amiably 
nuzzled her. 

These long rides gave us hours 
each day to talk. I had not spent so 
much time with Halum since child- 
hood and we grew wonderfully 
close. We were cautious with one 
another at first, not wishing to get 
too near the bone with our ques- 
tions, but soon we spoke as bond- 
kin should. I asked her why it was 
she had never married and she 
answered me simply, “One never 
encountered a suitable man.” Did 
she regret having gone without 
husband and children? No, she 
said, she regretted nothing, for 
her life had been tranquil and re- 
warding; yet there was wistful- 



ness in her tone. I could not press 
her farther. On her part she ques- 
tioned me about the Sumaran 
drug, trying to learn from me what 
merits it had that had led me to run 
such risks. I was amused by the 
way she phrased her inquiries: try- 
ing to sound earnest and sympath- 
etic and objective, yet unable to 
hide her horror at what I had 
done. It was as though her bond- 
brother had run amok and 
butchered twenty people in a mar- 
ketplace, and she now wished to 
discover, by means of patient and 
good-humored questioning, just 
what had been the philosophical 
basis that had led me to take up 
mass murder. I also tried to main- 
tain a temperate and dispassion- 
ate manner, so that I would not 
sear her with my intensity as I 
had done in that first interchange. 
I avoided all evangelizing and, as 
calmly and soberly as I could, ex- 
plained to her the effects of the 
drug, the benefits I gained from it 
and my reasons for rejecting the 
stony isolation of self that the 
Covenant imposes on us. Shortly 
a curious metamorphosis came 
over both her attitude and mine. 
She became less the highborn 
lady striving with well-meant 
warmth to understand the crim- 
inal, and more the student 
attempting to grasp the mysteries 
revealed by an initiated master. 
And I became less the descrip- 
tive reporter and more the proph-

et of a new dispensation. I spoke 
in flights of lyricism of the rap- 
tures of soulsharing; 1 told her 
of the strange wonder of the early 
sensations, as one begins to open, 
and of the blazing moment of 
union with another human con- 
sciousness; I depicted the exper- 
ience as something far more in- 
timate than any meeting of souls 
one might have with one’s bond- 
kin, or any visit to a drainer. Our 
conversations became mono- 
logs. I lost myself in verbal ec- 
stasies and came down from them 
at times to see Halum, silver- 
haired and eternally young, her 
eyes sparkling and her lips parted 
in total fascination. The out- 
come was inevitable. One scorch- 
ing afternoon as we walked slow- 
ly through the aisles in a field of 
grain that rose chest-high on her, 
she said without warning, “If the 
drug is available to you here, may 
your bondsister share it with 
you?” I had converted her. 

T HAT night I dissolved some 
pinches of the powder in two 
flasks of wine. Halum looked un- 
certain as I handed one to her and 
her uncertainty rebounded to me, 
so that I hesitated to go through 
with our project; but then she gave 
me a magical smile of tenderness 
and drained her flask. “There is no 
flavor of it,” she said, as I drank. 
We sat talking in Noim’s trophy 
hall, decked with hornfowl spears 



and draped with stormshield furs, 
and as the drug began to take ef- 
fect Halum started to shiver; I 
pulled a thick black hide from the 
wall, draped it about her shoulders 
and through it I held her until the 
chill was past. 

Would this go well? Despite all 
my propagandizing I was fright- 
ened. In every man’s life there is 
something he feels driven to do, 
something that pricks him at the 
core of his soul as long as it re- 
mains undone — yet as he ap- 
proaches the doing of it he will 
know fear, for perhaps to fulfill the 
obsession will bring him more pain 
than pleasure. So with Halum and 
me and the Sumaran drug. But my 
fear ebbed as the drug took hold. 
Halum was smiling. Halum was 
smiling. 

The wall between our souls be- 
came a membrane, through which 
we could slide at will. Halum was 
the first to cross it. I hung back, 
paralyzed by prudery, thinking 
even now that it would be an intru- 
sion on my bondsister’s maiden- 
hood for me to enter her mind and 
also a violation of the command- 
ment against bodily intimacies be- 
tween bond-kin. So I dangled in 
this absurd trap of contradictions, 
too inhibited to practice my own 
creed, for some moments after the 
last barriers had fallen; meanwhile 
Halum, realizing at last that 
nothing prevented her, slipped un- 
hesitatingly into tny spirit. My in- 



150 



GALAXY 




stant response was to try to shield 
myself: 1 did not want her to dis- 
cover this or this or that and par- 
ticularly to learn of my physical 
desire for her. But after a moment 
of this embarrassed flurrying 1 
ceased trying to plaster my soul 
with figleaves and went across into 
Halum, allowing the true com- 
munion to begin, the inextricable 
entanglement of selves. 

I found myself — it would be 
more accurate to say, I lost my- 
self -in corridors with glassy floors 
and silvered walls, through which 
played a cool sparkling light, like 
the crystalline brightness one sees 
reflected from the white sandy 
bottom of a shallow tropical cove. 
This was Halum’s virginal inward- 
ness. In niches along these corri- 
dors, neatly displayed, were the 
shaping factors of her life, memo- 
ries, images, odors, tastes, visions, 
fantasies, disappointments, de- 
lights. A prevaling purity governed 
everything. I saw no trace of sex- 
ual ecstasies, nothing of the fleshly 
passions. I cannot tell you whether 
Halum, out of modesty, took care 
to shield the area of her sexuality 
from my probings or had thrust it 
so far from her own consciousness 
that I could not detect it. 

She met me without fear and 
joined me in joy. I have no doubt of 
that. When our souls blended the 
union was complete, without 
reservation, without qualification. 
I swam through the glittering 



depths of her and the grime of my 
soul dropped from me: she was 
healing, she was cleansing. Was I 
staining her even as she was re- 
fining and purifying me? I cannot 
say. We surrounded and engulfed 
one another, supported one anoth- 
er and interpenetrated one anoth- 
er; and here mingling with my self 
was the self of Halum, who all my 
life had been my staff and my 
courage, my ideal and my goal, this 
cool incorruptible perfect in- 
carnation of beauty; and perhaps 
as this corruptible self of mine put 
on incorruption, the first corrosive 
plaque sprouted on her shining 
incorruptibility. I cannot say. I 
came to her and she came to me. 
At one point in our journey 
through one another I encountered 
a zone of strangeness, where 
something seemed coiled and 
knotted: and I remembered that 
time in my youth, when I was set- 
ting out from Salla City on my 
flight into Glin, when Halum had 
embraced me at Noim’s house and 
I thought I detected in her em- 
brace a tremor of barely sup- 
pressed passion, a flicker of the 
hunger of the body. For me. For 
me. And I thought that I had found 
that zone of passion again, only 
when 1 looked more closely at it, it 
was gone, and I beheld the pure 
gleaming metallic surface of her 
soul. Perhaps both the first time 
and the second it was something I 
manufactured out of my own 



ATIME OF CHANGES 



151 




churning desires and projected on 
her. I cannot say. Our souls were 
twined; 1 could not have known 
where I left off and Halum began. 

We emerged from the trance. 
The night was half gone. We 
blinked, we shook our foggy heads, 
we smiled uneasily. There is always 
that moment, coming out of the 
drug’s soul-intimacy, when one 
feels abashed, one thinks one has 
revealed too much and one wants 
to retract what one has given. 
Fortunately that moment is 
usually brief. I looked at Halum 
and felt my body afire with holy 
love, a love that was not at all of 
the flesh, and I started to say to 
her, as Schweiz had once said to 
me, I love you. But I choked on the 
word. The “I” was trapped in my 
teeth, like a fish in a weir. /. /. /. / 
love you, Halum. I. If I could only 
say it. /. It would not come. It was 
there, but could not get past my 
lips. I took her hands between 
mine — she smiled a serene moon- 
like smile and it would have been 
so easy then to hurl out the words, 
except that something imprisoned 
them. I. /. How could I speak to 
Halum of love and couch my love 
in the syntax of the gutter? I 
thought then that she would not 
understand, that my obscenity 
would shatter everything. Fool- 
ishness: our souls had been one, 
how then could a mere phrasing of 
words disturb anything? Out with 
it! / love you. Faltering, I said, 



“There is — such love in one — for 
you — such love, Halum — ” 

She nodded as if to say. Don’t 
speak, your clumsy words break 
the spell. As if to say. Yes, there is 
in . one such love for you also, 
Kinnall. As if to say, I love you, 
Kinnall. Lightly she rose to her feet 
and went to the window: cold 
summer moonlight on the formal 
garden of the great house, the 
bushes and trees white and still. I 
came up behind her and touched 
her at the shoulders, very gently. 
She wriggled and made a little pur- 
ring sound. I thought all was well 
with her. I was certain all was well 
with her. 

We held no post-mortems on 
what had taken place between us 
this evening. That, too, seemed to 
threaten a puncturing of the mood. 
We could discuss our trance 
tomorrow, and all the tomorrows 
beyond that. I went with her back 
to her room, not far down the 
hallway from my own, kissed her 
cheek timidly and had a sisterly 

kiss from her; she smiled again and 
closed the door behind her. In my 
own room I sat a while awake, , 
reliving everything. The missionary 
fervor was kindled anew in me. I 
would become an active messiah 
again, I vowed, going up and down 
this land of Salla spreading the 
creed of love; no more would I hide 
here at my bondbrother’s place, 
broken and adrift, a hopeless exile 
in my own nation. Stirron’s 



152 



GALAXY 




warning meant nothing to me. 
How could he drive me from Salla? 
I would make a hundred converts 
in a week. A thousand, ten 
thousand. 1 would give the drug to 
Stirron himself and let the septarch 
proclaim the new dispensation 
from his own throne! Halum had 
inspired me. In the morning I 
would set out, seeking disciples. 

There was a sound in the court- 
yard. I looked out and saw a 
groundcar: Noim had returned 
from his business trip. He entered 
the house; I heard him in the hall- 
way, passing my room; then came 
the sound of knocking. 1 peered 
into the corridor. He stood by 
HalunTs door, talking to her. 1 
could not see her. What was this, 
that he would go to Halum, who 
was nothing but a friend to him, 
and fail to greet his own bond- 
brother? Unworthy suspicions 
woke in me — unreal accusations. I 
forced them away. The conver- 
sation ended; HalunTs door closed; 
Noim, without noticing me, con- 
tinued toward his own bedroom. 

Sleep was impossible for me. I 
wrote a few pages, but they were 
worthless and at dawn I went out to 
stroll in the gray mists. It seemed 
to me that I heard a distant cry. 
Some animal seeking its mate, I 
thought. Some lost beast wander- 
ing at daybreak. 

I WAS alone at breakfast. That 
was unusual but not surprising: 

A TIME OF CHANGES 



Noim, coming home in the middle 
of the night after a long drive, 
would have wanted to sleep late 
and doubtless the drug had left 
Halum exhausted. My appetite was 
powerful and I ate for the three of 
us, all the while planning my 
schemes for dissolving the 
Covenant. As I sipped my tea one 
of Noim’s grooms burst wildly in- 
to the dining hall. His cheeks were 
blazing and his nostrils were flared, 
as if he had run a long way and 
were close to collapse. “Come,’' 
he cried, gasping. “The storm- 
shields — " He tugged at my arm, 
half dragging me from my seat. I 
rushed out after him. He was al- 
ready far down the unpaved road 
that led to the stormshield pens. I 
followed, wondering if the beasts 
had escaped in the night, wonder- 
ing if I must spend the day chasing 
monsters again. As I neared the 
pens I saw no signs of a breakout, 
no clawed tracks, no torn fences. 
The groom clung to the bars of the 
biggest pen, which held nine or ten 
stormshields. I looked in. The ani- 
mals were clustered, bloody- 
jawed, bloody-furred, around some 
ragged meaty haunch. They were 
snarling and quarreling over the 
last scraps of flesh; I could see 
traces of their feast scattered 
across the ground. Had some un- 
fortunate farm beast strayed 
among these killers by darkness? 
How could such a thing have hap- 
pened? And why would the groom 

153 




see fit to haul me from my break- 
fast to show it to me? I caught his 
arm and asked him what was so 
strange about the sight of storm- 
shields devouring their kill. He 
turned a terrible face to me and 
blurted in a strangled voice, ‘The 
lady — the lady — " 

XX 

N OIM was brutal with me. 

“You lied," he said. “You 
denied you were carrying the drug, 
but you lied. And you gave it to her 
last night. Yes? Yes? Yes? Don't 
hide anything now, Kinnall. You 
gave it to her!" 

“You spoke with her," 1 said. I 
could barely manage words. 
“What did she tell you?" 

“One stopped by her door be- 
cause one thought one heard the 
sound of sobbing," Noim an- 
swered. “One inquired if she felt 
well. She came out: her face was 
strange, it was full of dreams, her 
eyes were as blank as pieces of 
polished metal and yes, yes, she 
had been weeping. And one asked 
what was wrong, whether there had 
been any trouble here. No, she 
said, all was well. She said you and 
she had talked all evening. Why 
was she weeping, then? She 
shrugged and smiled and said it 
was a female thing, an unimpor- 
tant thing — women weep all the 
time, she said, and need give no 
explanations. And she smiled again 



and closed the door. But that look 
in her eyes — it was the drug, 
Kinnall! You gave it to her against 
all your vows! And now — and 
now — " 

“Please," I said softly. But he 
went on shouting, loading me with 
accusations, and 1 could not reply. 

The grooms had reconstructed 
everything. They had found the 
path of Halum’s feet in the dew- 
moist sandy road. They had found 
ajar the door of the house that 
gives access to the stormshield 
pens. They had found marks of 
forcing on the inner door that leads 
to the feeding gate itself. She had 
gone through; she had carefully 
opened the feeding gate and just as 
carefully closed it behind her, to 
loose no killers on the sleeping 
estate; then she had offered herself 
to the waiting claws. All this 
between darkness and dawn, 
perhaps even while I strolled in a 
different part. That cry out of the 
mists. 

Why? Why? Why? Why ? 

B Y EARLY afternoon such few 
possessions as 1 had were 
packed. 1 asked Noim for the loan 
of a groundcar and he granted it 
with a brusque wave of his fingers. 
There was no question of my re- 
maining here any longer. Not only 
were echoes of Halum resonating 
everywhere — I also had to go 
where I could think undisturbed, 
examine all that 1 had done and 



154 



GALAXY 




that I hoped to do. Nor did I wish 
to be here when the district police 
carried out their inquest into 
Halum’s death. 

Had she been unable to face me 
again, the morning after having 
given her soul away? She had gone 
gladly enough into the sharing of 
selves. But afterward, in that rush 
of guilty reappraisal that often 
follows the first opening, she may 
have felt another way: old habits of 
reticence reasserting themselves, a 
sudden cascading sense of horror 
at what she had revealed. And the 
quick irreversible decision, the 
frozen-faced trek to the 
stormshield pens, the ill-considered 
passing of the final gate, the 
moment of regret-within-regret as 
the animals pounced and she 
realized she had carried her 
atonement too far. Was that it? I 
could think of no other ex- 
planation for that plunge from se- 
renity to despair, except that it was 
a second thought, a reflex of shock 
that swept her to doom. And I was 
without a bond-sister — and had 
lost bondbrother, too, for Noim’s 
eyes were merciless when he looked 
at me. Was this what I had 
intended when 1 dreamed of 
opening-souls? 

“Where will you go?” Noim 
asked. “They'll jail you in Man- 
neran. Take one step into Glin with 
your drug and you’ll be flayed. 
Stirron will hound you out of Salla. 
Where, then, Kinnall? Threish? 



Velis? Or maybe Umbis, eh? 
Dabis? No! By the gods, it will be 
Sumara Borthan, won’t it? Yes. 
Among your savages — and you’ll 
have all the selfbaring you'll need 
there, yes? Yes?” 

Quietly I said, “You forget the 
Burnt Lowlands, Noim. A cabin in 
the desert — a place to think, a 
place of peace — there is so much 
one must try to understand now — ” 
“The Burnt Lowlands? Yes, 
that’s good, Kinnall. The Burnt 
Lowlands in high summer. A fiery 
purge for your soul. Go there, yes. 
Go.” 

A LONE I drove northward along 
the flank of the Huishtors, and 
then westward, on the road that 
leads to Kongoroi and Salla’s 
Gate. More than once I thought of 
swerving the car and sending it 
tumbling over the highway’s rim 
and making an end. More than 
once, as the first light of day 
touched my eyelids in some back- 
country hostelry, I thought of Hal- 
um and had to struggle to leave 
my bed, for it seemed so much 
easier to go on sleeping. Day and 
night and day and night and day, 
and a few days more, and I was 
deep into West Salla, ready to go 
up the mountains and through the 
gate. While resting one night in a 
town midway into the uplands I 
discovered that an order was out in 
Salla for my arrest. Kinnall 
Darival, the septarch’s son, a man 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



155 




of thirty -years, of this height and 
having these features, brother to 
the Lord Stirron, was wanted for 
monstrous crimes: selfbaring and 
the use of a dangerous drug, 
which against the explicit orders 
of the septarch he was offering to 
the unwary. By means of this drug 
the fugitive Darival had driven 
his own bondsister insane and, in 
her madness, she had perished in 
a horrible way. Therefore all citi- 
zens of Salla were enjoined to ap- 
prehend the evildoer, for whom a 
heavy reward would be paid. 

If Stirron knew why Halum 
had died, then Noim had told him 
everything. I was lost. When I 
reached Salla’s Gate I would find 
officers of the West Sallan con- 
stabulary waiting for me, for my 
destination was known. Why had 
the announcement not informed 
the populace that I was heading 
for the Burnt Lowlands? Possibly 
Noim had held back some of what 
he knew. 

I had no choice but to go for- 
ward. It would take me days to 
reach the coast and I would find all 
of Salla’s ports altered for me when 
I got there; even if I slipped on 
board a vessel, where would I go? 
Glin? Manneran? It was similar- 
ly hopeless to think of my getting 
somehow across the Huish or the 
Woyn into the neighboring prov- 
inces: I was already proscribed in 
Manneran and surely I would 
find a chilly greeting in Glin. The 



Burnt Lowlands it would have to 
be, then. I would stay there some 
while and then, perhaps, try to 
make my way out via one of the 
Threishtop passes to start a new 
life on the western coast. Perhaps. 

I bought provisions at a place 
that served the needs of hunters 
entering the Lowlands: dried 
food, some weapons, and con- 
densed water, enough to last me 
by careful expansion for several 
moontimes. As 1 made my pur- 
chases I thought the townsfolk 
were eyeing me strangely. Did 
they recognize me as the de- 
praved prince whom the septarch 
sought? No one moved to seize me. 
Possibly they knew there was a 
cordon across Salla’s Gate and 
would take no risks with such a 
brute when there were police in 
plenty to get me on top of Kon- 
goroi. Whatever the reason, I 
got out of the town unbothered, 
and set out now on the final 
stretch of the highway. In the past 
I had come this way only in win- 
ter when snow lay deep; even now 
there were patches of dirty white- 
ness in shadowy corners. As the 
road rose the snow thickened, un- 
til near Kongoroi’s double sum- 
mit everything lay mantled in it. 
Timing my ascent carefully, I 
managed things so that I came to 
the great pass well after sundown, 
hoping that darkness would pro- 
tect me in case of a roadblock. But 
the gate was unguarded. My car’s 



156 



GALAXY 




lights were off as I drove the last 
distance — I half expected to go 
over the edge. I made the familiar 
left turn that brought me into Sal- 
la’s Gate and I saw no one there. 
Stirron had not had time to close 
the western border — or did not 
think I would be so mad as to flee 
that way. I went forward, through 
the pass and slowly down the 
switchbacks on the western face 
of Kongoroi. When dawn over- 
took me I was into the Burnt Low- 
lands, choking in the heat but safe. 

XXI 

N EAR the place where the horn- 
fowl nest I found this cabin — 
about where I remembered it to be. 
It was without plumbing, nor were 
the walls whole, yet it would do. It 
would do. The awful heat of the 
place would be my purge. I set up 
housekeeping inside, laying out 
my things, unpacking the journal 
paper I had bought for this record 
of my life and deeds, setting the 
jeweled case containing the last of 
the drug in a corner, piling my 
clothing above it, sweeping away 
the red sand. On my first full day of 
residence I busied myself 
camouflaging my groundcar, so 
that it would not betray my 
presence when searchers came: I 
drove it into a shallow ravine and 
collected woody ground plants to 
make a covering for it, throwing 
sand atop the interwoven stems of 



the plants. Only sharp eyes would 
see the car when I was done. I 
made careful note of the place, lest 
I fail to find it myself when I was 
ready to leave. 

For some days I simply walked 
the desert, thinking. I went to the 
place where the hornfowl struck 
down my father and had no fear of 
the sharp-beaked circling birds: let 
them have me too. I considered the 
events of my time of changes, ask- 
ing myself, Is this what you 
wanted? Is this what you hoped to 
bring about? Does this satisfy 
you? I relived each of my many 
soulsharings, from that with 
Schweiz to that with Halum, ask- 
ing, Was this good? Were there 
mistakes that could have been 
avoided? Did you gain — or did you 
lose by what you did? And I con- 
cluded that I had gained more than 
I had lost, although my losses had 
been terrible ones. My only re- 
grets were for poor tactics, not for 
faulty principles. If I had stayed 
with Halum until her uncertain- 
ties had fled she might not have 
given way to the shame that des- 
troyed her. If I had been more open 
with Noim — if I had stayed in 
Manneran to confront my en- 
emies — if — if — if — and yet I had 
no regrets for having done my 
changing, only for having bun- 
gled my revolution of the soul. 
For I was convinced of the wrong- 
ness of the Covenant and of our 
way of life. Your way of life. That

157 




Halum had seen fit to kill herself 
after two hours of experiencing 
human love was the most scath- 
ing possible indictment of the 
Covenant. 

And finally — not too many days 
ago — I began to write what you 
have been reading. My fluency 
surprised me; perhaps I verged on 
glibness, though it was hard for 
me at first to use the grammar 1 
imposed on myself. / am Kinnall 
Darival and I mean to tell you all 
about myself. So I began my 
memoir. Have I been true to that 
intent? Have I concealed any- 
thing? Day upon day my pen had 
scratched paper and I have put 
myself down whole for you, with 
no cosmetic alterations of the 
record. In this sweatbox of a cab- 
in have I laid myself bare. Mean- 
while I have had no contact with 
the outside world except for oc- 
casional hints, possibly irra- 
tional, that Stirron’s agents are 
combing the Burnt Lowlands for 
me. I believe that guards are 
posted at the gates leading into 
Salla, Glin and Manneran; and 
probably at the western passes as 
well; and also in Stroin Gap, in 
case I try to make my way to the 
Gulf of Sumar through the Wet 
Lowlands. My luck has held well, 
but soon they must find me. Shall I 
wait for them? Or shall I move on, 
trusting to fortune, hoping to 
find an unguarded exit? I have this 
thick manuscript. I value it now 



more than life itself. If you could 
read it, if you could see how I have 
stumbled and staggered toward 
knowledge of self, if you could re- 
ceive from it the vibrations of my 
mind — I have put everything 
down, I think, in this autobi- 
ography, in this record of self, in 
this document unique in the his- 
tory of Velada Borthan. If I am 
captured here my book will be 
captured with me and Stirron will 
have it burned. 

I must move on then. 

A sound? Engines? 

A groundcar is coming swiftly 
toward my cabin over the flat red 
land. I am found. It is done. At 
least I was able to write this much. 

PlVE days have passed since t the 
’■* last entry and I am still here. 
The groundcar was NoinTs. He 
came not to arrest me but to res- 
cue me. Cautiously, as if expecting 
me to open fire on him, he crept 
about my cabin, calling, ‘"Kinnall? 
Kinnall?" I went outside. He tried 
to smile but was too tense to 
manage it. He said, “One thought 
you would be somewhere near this 
place. The place of the hornfowl — 
it still haunts you, eh?" 

“What do you want?" 

“Stirron’s patrols are searching 
for you, Kinnall. Your path was 
traced as far as Salla’s Gate. They 
know you’re in the Burnt Low- 
lands. If Stirron knew you as well 
as your bondbrother does, he’d 



158 



GALAXY 




come straight here with his troops. 
Instead they’re searching to the 
south. The theory is that you mean 
to go into the Wet Lowlands — to 
the Gulf of Sumar — and get a ship 
to Sumara Borthan. But they’re 
bound to start hunting for you in 
this region once they discover 
you haven’t been down there." 

“And then?" 

“You’ll be arrested. Tried. Con- 
victed. Jailed or executed. Stirron 
thinks you’re the most dangerous 
man on Velada Borthan." 

“I am," I said. 

Noim gestured toward the car. 
“Get in. We’ll slip through the 
blockade. Into West Salla, some- 
how, and down to the Woyn. The 
Duke of Sumar will meet you and 
put you aboard some vessel head- 
ing out. You can be in Sumara 
Borthan by next moonrise." 

“Why are you helping me, 
Noim? Why should you bother? I 
saw the hate in your eyes when I 
left you?" 

“Hate? Hate? No, Kinnall, no 
hate, only sorrow. One is still 
your " He paused. With an ef- 
fort, he said, “/'m still your bond- 
brother. I’m pledged to your wel- 
fare. How can I let Stirron hunt 
you like a beast? Come. Come. I’ll 
get you safely out of here." 

“No." 

“No?" 

“We’re certain to be caught. 
Stirron will have you, too, for aid- 
ing a fugitive. He’ll seize your 



lands. He’ll break your rank. Don’t 
make a useless sacrifice for me, 
Noim." 

“I came all the way into the 
Burnt Lowlands to fetch you. If 
you think I’ll go back without — " 

“Let’s not quarrel over it," I 
said. “Even if I escape, what is 
there for me? To spend the rest of 
my life hiding in the jungles of 
Sumara Borthan — among peo- 
ple whose language I can’t speak 
and whose ways are alien to me? 
No. No. I’m tired of exile. Let 
Stirron take me." 

Persuading Noim to leave me 
here was no little task. We stood in 
the midday fire for eternal min- 
utes, arguing vehemently. He 
was determined to effect this 
heroic rescue, despite the al- 
most certain probability that we 
would both be captured. This he 
was doing out of a sense of duty, 
not out of love, for I could see that 
he still held Halum’s death to my 
account. I would not have his dis- 
grace scored against me as well and 
told him so: he had done nobly to 
make this journey, but I could not 
go with him. Finally he began to 
yield, but only when I swore I 
would at least make some effort to 
save myself. I promised that I 
would set out for the western 
mountains instead of sitting 
where Stirron would surely find 
me. If I reached Velis or Threish 
safely, I said, I would notify 
Noim in some way, so that he

would cease to fear my fate. And 
then I said, “There is one thing you 
can do for me/' 1 brought my 
manuscript out of the cabin — a 
great heap of paper, red scrib- 
bling on grayish, rough sheets. In 
this, I said, he would find the whole 
story. 1 asked him to read it and to 
pass no judgment on me until he 
had. “You will find things in here 
that will horrify and disgust 
you,” I warned him. “But I think 
you’ll also find much that will 
open your eyes and your soul. Read 
it, Noim. Read it with care. Think 
about my words.” And I asked one 
last vow of him, by our oath of 
bonding: that he safely preserve 
my book even if the temptation 
came over him to burn it. “These 
pages hold my soul,” I told him. 
“Destroy the paper and you des- 
troy me. If you loathe what you 
read hide the book, but do no harm 
to it. What shocks you now may 
not shock you a few years from 
now. And some day you may want 
to show my book to others, so that 
you can explain what manner of 
man your bondbrother was and 
why he did what he did.” And so 
that you may change them as I 
hope my book will change you , I 
said silently. Noim vowed this 
vow. He took my sheaf of pages 
and stored them in the hold of his 
groundcar. We embraced; he 
asked me again if I would not ride 
away with him; again I refused; I 
made him say once more he would 



read my book and preserve it; 
once more he swore he would; then 
he drove slowly toward the east. I 
entered the cabin. The place 
where 1 had kept my manuscript 
was empty and I felt a sudden 
hollowness, I suppose much like 
that of a woman who has car- 
ried a child for the full seven 
moontimes and now finds her bel- 
ly flat again. I had poured all of 
myself into those pages. Now 1 
was nothing and the book was all. 
Would Noim read it? I thought so. 
And would he preserve it? Very 
likely he would, though he might 
hide it in the darkest corner of his 
house. And would he some day 
show it to others? This I do not 
know. But if you have read what I 
have written it is through the kind- 
ness of Noim Condorit; and if he 
has let it be read — then I have pre- 
vailed over his soul after all, as I 
hope to prevail over yours. 

I HAD said to Noim that I 
would remain in the cabin no 
longer but would set out for the 
west in an attempt to save myself. 
But that sweltering shack had 
become my home. I stayed a day, 
another day and a third, doing 
nothing, wandering the blazing 
solitude of the Burnt Lowlands, 
watching the hornfowl circle. On 
the fifth day, as you perhaps are 
able to see, I fell into the habit of 
autobiography again, sat down 
at the place where I had lately 



160 



GALAXY 




spent so many hours sitting and 
wrote a few new pages to describe 
my visit from Noim. Then I let 
three days more go by, telling my- 
self that on the fourth 1 would dig 
my groundcar out of the red sand 
and head westward. But on the 
morning of that fourth day Stir- 
ron and his men found my hiding 
place and now it is evening of that 
day and I have an hour or two 
more to write, by the grace of the 
Lord Stirron. And when 1 have 
done with this, I will write no more. 

THEY came in six well-armed 
groundcars, surrounded my 
cabin and called on me through 
loudspeakers to surrender. I had no 
hope of resisting them, nor any 
desire to try. Calmly- -for what 
use was fear? — I showed myself, 
hands upraised, at the cabin door. 
They left their cars and I was 
amazed to find Stirron himself 
among them, drawn out of his pal- 
ace into the Lowlands for an out- 
of-season hunting party with his 
brother as quarry. He wore all his 
finery of office. Slowly he 
walked toward me. I had not seen 
him in some years and was ap- 
palled by the signs of age on him: 
shoulders rounded, head thrust 
forward, hair thinning, face deep- 
ly lined, eyes yellowed and dim. 
The profits of half a lifetime of 
supreme power. We regarded 
one another in silence, like two 
strangers seeking a point of con- 



tact. I tried to find in him that boy, 
my playmate, my elder brother, 
whom I had loved and lost so long 
ago, and 1 saw only a grim old 
man with trembling lips. A sep- 
tarch is trained to mask his inner 
feelings, yet Stirron was able to 
hold nothing secret from me, nor 
could he keep one consistent ex- 
pression: I saw in his face, one 
tumbling across the other, tok- 
ens of imperial rage, bewilder- 
ment, sorrow, contempt, and 
something that I took to be a sort 
of suppressed love. I spoke first, 
inviting him into my cabin for a 
conference. He hesitated, per- 
haps thinking i had assassina- 
tion in mind, but after a moment 
he accepted in right kingly man- 
ner, waving to his bodyguard to 
wait outside. When we were alone 
another silent spell obtained, 
which this time he broke, saying, 
“One has never felt such pain, 
Kinnall. One scarcely believes 
what one has heard about you. 
That you should stain our father’s 
memory — ” 

“Is it such a stain, Lord Sep- 
tarch?” 

“To foul the Covenant? To cor- 
rupt the innocent — your bondsis- 
ter among the victims? What have 
you been doing, Kinnall? What 
have you been doing?" 

A terrible fatigue came over me 
and I closed my eyes, for I scarce- 
ly knew where to begin explain- 
ing. After a moment I found 



A TIME OF CHANGES

strength. I reached toward him, 
smiling, taking his hand, and 
said, “1 love you, Stirron.” 

“How sick you are!” 

“To talk of love? But we came 
out of the same womb! Am I not to 
love you?” 

“Is this how you talk now, only 
in filth?” 

“I talk as my heart commands 
me. 

“You are not only sick but sick- 
ening,” said Stirron. He turned 
away and spat on the sandy floor. 
He seemed a remote medieval fig- 
ure to me, trapped behind his dour 
kingly face, imprisoned in his 
jewels of office and his robes of 
state, speaking in gruff, distant 
tones. How could I reach him? 

I said, “Stirron, take the Su- 
maran drug with me. I have a little 
left. I’ll mix it for us. We’ll drink it 
together and in an hour or two 
our souls will be one and you’ll un- 
derstand. I swear, you’ll under- 
stand. Will you do it? Kill me af- 
terward if you still want to, but 
take the drug first.” I began to 
bustle about, making ready the 
potion. Stirron caught my wrist 
and halted me. He shook his head, 
with the slow, heavy gesture of one 
who feels an infinite sadness. 

“No,” he said. “Impossible.” 

“Why?” 

“You will not fuddle the mind 
of the prime septarch.” 

“I’m interested in reaching the 
mind of my brother Stirron!” 

162 



“As your brother, one wishes 
only that you may be healed. As 
prime septarch, one must avoid 
harm, for one belongs to one’s 
pepple.” 

“The drug is harmless, Stir- 
ron.” 

“Was it harmless for Halum 
Helalam?” 

“Are you a frightened virgin?” I 
asked. “I’ve given the drug to 
scores of people. Halum is the on- 
ly one who reacted badly — Noim 
too, I suppose, but he got over it. 
And—” 

“The two people in the world 
closest to you,” said Stirron, “and 
the drug harmed them both. Now 
you offer it to your brother?” 

It was hopeless. I asked him 
again, several times, to risk an ex- 
periment with the drug, but of 
course he would not touch it. And 
would it have availed me anything 
if he had? I would have found only 
iron in his soul. 

1 asked, “What will happen to 
me now?” 

“A fair trial, followed by an 
honest sentence.” 

“Which will be what? Execu- 
tion? Imprisonment for life? Ex- 
ile?” 

Stirron shrugged. “It is for the 
court to decide. Do you take one 
for a tyrant?” 

“Stirron, why does the drug 
frighten you so? Do you know 
what it does? Can I make you see 
that it brings only love and under- 



GALAXY 




standing? There’s no need for us to 
live as strangers to each other, 
with blankets around our souls. 
We can speak ourselves out. We 
can reach forth. We can say 7,’ 
Stirron, and not have to apolo- 
gize for having selves. /. /. /. We 
can tell each other what gives us 
pain and help each other to es- 
cape that pain.” His face dark- 
ened; I think he was sure 1 was 
mad. I went past him to the place 
where I had put down the drug, 
quickly mixed it and offered a 
flask to him. He shook his head. I 
drank, impulsively gulping it, 
and offered the flask again to him. 
“Go on,” I said. “Drink. Drink! It 
won’t begin for a while. Take it 
now, so we’ll be open at the same 
time. Please, Stirron!” 

“I could kill you myself,” he 
said, “without waiting for the 
court to act.” 

“Yes! Say it, Stirron! 1! My- 
self! Say it again!” 

“Miserable selfbarer. My fath- 
er’s son! If I talk to you in ‘I,’ Kin- 
nail, it’s because you deserve no 
better than filth from me.” 

“It doesn’t need to be filth. 
Drink — and understand.” 

“Never.” 

“Why do you oppose it, Stir- 
ron? What frightens you?” 

“The Covenant is sacred,” he 
said. “To question the Covenant 
is to question the whole social or- 
der. Turn this drug of yours loose 
in the land and all reason col- 



lapses, all stability is lost. Do you 
think our forefathers were vil- 
lains? Do you think they were 
fools? Kinnall, they understood 
how to create a lasting society. 
Where are the cities of Sumara 
Borthan? Why do they still live in 
jungle huts while we have built 
what we have built? You’d put us 
on their road, Kinnall. You’d 
break down the distinctions be- 
tween right and wrong, so that in a 
short while law itself would be 
washed away and every man’s 
hand would be lifted against his fel- 
low — and where would be your 
love and universal understand- 
ing then? No, Kinnall. Keep your 
drug. One still prefers the Conven- 
ant.” 

“Stirron—” 

“Enough. The heat is intoler- 
able. You are arrested; now let us 
go" 

B ECAUSE the drug was in me 
Stirron agreed to let me have a 
few hours alone before we began 
the journey back to Salla, so that I 
would not have to travel while my 
soul was vulnerable to external 
sensations. A small mercy from 
the lord septarch: he posted two 
men as guards outside my cabin 
and went off with the others to 
hunt hownfowl until the coming 
of dusk. 

Never had I taken the drug with- 
out a sharer. So the strangenesses 
came upon me and I was alone 



ATIME OF CHANGES

with them to hear the throbbings 
and the whinings and the rushings 
and then, as the walls fell away 
from my soul there was no one for 
me to enter and no one to enter 
me. Yet I could detect the souls of 
my guards— hard, closed, metal- 
lic — and I felt that with some ef- 
fort I could reach even into them. 
But 1 did not, for as I sat by my- 
self I was launched on a miracu- 
lous voyage, my self expanding 
and soaring until 1 encompassed 
this our entire planet and all the 
souls of mankind were merged in- 
to mine. And a wondrous vision 
came upon me. I saw my bond- 
brother Noim making copies of 
my memoir and distributing 
them to those he could trust. Oth- 
er copies were made from those, to 
circulate through the provinces 
of Velada Borthan. And out of 
the southern land now came ship- 
loads of the white powder, sought 
not merely by an elite, not only 
by the Duke of Sumar and the 
Marquis of Woyn, but by thou- 
sands of ordinary citizens, by 
people hungry for love, by those 
who found the Covenant turning 
to ashes, those who wished to reach 
one another’s souls. And though 
the guardians of the old order did 
what they could to halt the move- 
ment, it could not be stopped, for 
the former Covenant had run its 
course and now it was clear that 
love and gladness could no longer 
be suppressed. Until at last a net- 

164 



work of communication existed, 
shining filaments of sensory per- 
ception linking one to one to one 
to all. Until at last even the sep- 
tarchs and the justiciars were 
swept up in the tide of liberation 
and all the world joined in joyous 
communion, each of us open to 
all, and the time of changes was 
complete; the new Covenant was 
established. I saw all this from 
my shabby cabin in the Burnt 
Lowlands. I saw the bright glow 
encompassing the world, shim- 
mering, flickering, gaining pow- 
er, deepening in hue. I saw walls 
crumbling. I saw the brilliant red 
blaze of universal love. I saw new 
faces, changed and exultant. 
Hands touching hands. Selves 
touching selves. This vision 
blazed in my soul for half a day, 
filling me with joy such as I had 
never experienced at any time, 
and my soaring spirit wandered 
in realms of dream. And only as 
the drug began to ebb from me did 
I realize that the vision was noth- 
ing but a fantasy. 

Perhaps it will not always be a 
fantasy. Perhaps Noim will find 
readers for what I have written 
and perhaps others will be per- 
suaded to follow my path until 
there are enough like me and the 
changes become irreversible 
and universal. It has happened 
before. I will disappear, I the 
forerunner, I the anticipator, I 
the martyred prophet. But what I 

GALAXY 




have written will live and through 
me you will be changed. It may yet 
be that this is no idle dream. 

This final page has been set 
down as twilight descends. The 
sun hastens toward the Huish- 
tors. Soon, as Stirron’s prisoner, 
I will follow it. I will take this lit- 
tle manuscript with me, hidden 
somewhere about me, and if I 
have good fortune I will find some 
way of giving it to Noim, so that it 
can be joined to the pages he has al- 
ready had from me. I cannot say if 
I will succeed, nor do I know what 
will become of me and of my 
book. And you who read this are 
unknown to me. But I can say this: 



that if the two parts have become 
one and you read me com- 
plete— you may be sure that I have 
begun to prevail. Out of that join- 
ing can come only changes for 
Velada Borthan, changes for all 
of you. If you have read this far 
you must be with me in soul. So I 
say to you, my unknown reader, 
that I love you and reach my hand 
toward you, I who was Kinnall 
Darival, I who have opened the 
way, I who promised to tell you all 
about myself and who now can say 
that that promise has been ful- 
filled. Go and seek. Go and touch. 
Go and love. Go and be open. Go 
and be healed. ★

sex in story content when it’s im- 
portant to the story — and here 
again a few comments are in or-

Let’s take excerpts from one of 
your letters:

this issue (ire: I Will Fear No Evil

Crossing ... I am (not) a physi- 
cian, scientist , engineer or a 
technician — would you believe 
Educator? 

I am not against real-life sex 
when it's important to the story: 
True. But it had better be damn 
important! If I want to read a sex

novel ( and I have at times ) I will go 
buy a sex novel . 

Bob Snow 
San Bernardino, Cal. 

You’ve made a point for me. 
That sex per se “always sells” is a 
popular fantasy — other topics 
have sold and will continue to sell 
as well or better. 

But to pretend that sex doesn’t 
exist is as much a fantasy. I will 
not, as several authors already 
know, buy a story simply because 
it has sex — but neither will I turn 
down a story for that sole reason. 

Thank you for your vote. 

A great many of you went to 
great pains to answer the ques- 
tionnaire by letter rather than cut 
up an issue. The following note

appended to answers to the poll, 
is a sample. 

. / almost neglected answer- 
ing your questionnaire in order to 
keep my Galaxy intact. However , 
my feelings of near-duty got the 
best of me and I had to reply — late 
and sloppy. (No, I was sloppy, 
placing the questionnaire where 
I did. — Ed.) I do hope , however , 
I will be counted. Especially in 
this time of metamorphosis of my 
favorite magazine . 

Brent Higinbotham

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I already subscribe, so Vll not 
take advantage of your offer. 

Just a few comments on your 
questionnaire. First, I like stories 
by a lot of other people besides 
those 9 listed. The novel-length 
serials are fine. The illustrations 
are good, but they are not all that 
important — the editorial con- 
tent is what it’s all about. The sci- 
ence-fact articles are okay, but 
don't make them too technical. 
Just the same, I buy Galaxy for 
the fiction and the book reviews. 
As far as I'm concerned profani- 
ty in fiction shouldn't be cen- 
sored, but don’t go out of the way 
to insert it either. The next ques- 
tion confused me, but I'll say here 
that fantasy is fine (if you stop 
publishing it, F&SF will be the 
only quality purveyors of the 
form. 

One thing I've noticed in science 
fiction in the last 12 years is that 
the characterizations are getting 
better along with everything else. 
If sex is necessary to the story de- 



velopment, by all means let’s 
have, it. Sex is part of a human be- 
ing's life. 

Harold F. Metcalf

. Heinlein should make war 
and let Sturgeon make love. 
IWFNE was fun but couldn't hold 
a candle to The Moon Is a Harsh 
Mistress . 

David Lee Powell 
Bellevue, N.B. 

... I cannot express my mind on 
the questions I circled with a sim- 
ple Yes, No, True or False. I feel a 
little as though I'm being asked 
whether I prefer prudishness or 
obscenity . 

Henri Lastrapes 

... I am a grade school teacher 
and the wife of a chemical engi- 
neer. Much enjoyed your abso- 
lutely wonderful serial by Hein- 
lein: I Will Fear No Evil. I only 
wish it had not ended. 

John and I have been arguing for 
months as to whether the book is 
pornographic. I say yes; he says 
no. I think this is due to sex differ- 
ences in viewpoints. We both 
agree that the story is not repul- 
sively pornographic and feel that 
this is the important factor. 

Mrs. John Caccione

The book is not pornographic by 
any definition. I know. 



I think all of you, without ex- 
ception, have helped give Galaxy 
a new direction — may it reward 
you. —JAKOBSSON

THE BUYER 

LARRY EISENBERG 



H E WAS tall, very dark-skinned, 
with shaggy uncut hair. But his 
clothes were elegant, cut by the 
finest Sentient tailor. He stood off 
at a distance, looking at me 
speculatively. I pretended not to 
notice him. 

The dining console was some- 
what different from those I was 
used to and I had a little trouble 



placing my breakfast order. As I 
sat there, somewhat baffled by 
the instructions on how to enter 
the proper code, he came over and 
sat down at my table. 

“Can you use some help?” he 
asked amiably. 

I nodded. He showed me how to 
enter an order for simulated ham 
and eggs. I pushed the ap- 



167 




propriate buttons and a few min- 
utes later, a steaming dish came 
up through the center table lift. It 
looked and tasted pretty good. 

Then I realized that I had for- 
gotten my manners. 

“Would you like something?” I 
asked. 

“No,” he said. “1 never eat 
when I’m on business.” 

“What’s your business?” 

He smiled. 

“Right now you’re my busi- 
ness.” 

I dug into the food and chewed 
it, pondering his remark and baf- 
fled at what he was getting at. 

“I don’t think I know you,” I 
said. "Don’t be offended. My 
memory was never of the best.” 

“We’ve never met,” he said. 
“But I know you very well. I’ve got 
a business proposition to make 
to you.” 

I smiled. I had been prospecting 
in the Sentient hills for almost six 
years, sifting through the 
abandoned mineral mines for 
signs of gold. Once or twice I had 
found a small vein with enough 
paydirt to stake me for another 
year or two. But the few claims I 
had were worthless. 

He seemed to sense what I was 
thinking. 

“It’s not your claims I’m inter- 
ested in,” he said. “I want to buy 
your name.” 

I chuckled. 

“ That ain’t worth much,” I said. 



I thought it was a pretty good 
joke on his part. 

“I don't think you even know my 
name,” I added. 

He pronounced it clearly, each 
syllable getting exaggerated 
emphasis. I had never heard my 
name pronounced that way be- 
fore but it was definitely mine. 

“You think I’m joking,” he 
said. “But I’m not. I’ll give you 
fifty thousand Sentient credits for 
your name.” 

I was jolted into putting down 
my fork. 

“That’s a hell of a lot of 
money,” I said. 

It was more than I had made in 
the past ten years or was likely to 
make in the next ten. 

“What the hell do you want with 
my name?” I said tartly. 

“Fifty thousand credits,” he 
said. “I got the name transfer 
forms right here. You sign on this 
line. I sign there. We go over to the 
town clerk and get it validated and 
I hand over fifty thousand credits 
in cash. The whole thing shouldn’t 
take more than half an hour.” 

I put my dish back on the table 
center lift and pressed the BUS 
button. The dish slid out of sight. I 
picked up the napkin and wiped 
my mouth. Then I stood up. 

“Thanks for helping me order,” 
I said. “But I got to get going 
now.” 

“Sit down for a minute,” he said 
soothingly. “You don’t seem to 



168 



GALAXY 




catch on to what I'm saying. 
You’ll never get a better deal as 
long as you live.” 

I sat down. 

“Get this straight,” I told him. 
“I ain’t selling my name. It was 
my father's name and his father's 
before him. Besides, it ain't much 
of a name.” 

He pronounced my name again 
but this time it was all music and 
loving sounds. 



WIT'S a beautiful name,” he said. 

■^“You don't think I’d offer fifty 
thousand for just any name?” 

He reached into his shirt pocket 
and withdrew a small notebook. 

“There's some in here I didn't 
give more than five hundred for. 
But yours is worth every bit of 
what I’m offering.” 

“I ain't interested,” I said. 

He clucked his tongue. 




James Gunn, author of "The Mes- 
sage," the third stories in the series 
that began with "The Listeners" 
[Galaxy, August, 19681, began writ- 
ing science fiction in 1948. Since then 
he has produced ten books and some 
sixty shorter works and has held a 
series of professional positions as 
paperback editor, university public 
relations director, college teacher 
—all reflecting his interests. He is 
the author of This Fortress World, 
Star Bridge [with Jack Williamson], 
Station in Space, The Joy Makers, 
The Immortals, Future Imperfect, 
The Witching Hour and The Immor- 
tal, and he edited Man and the Fu- 
ture. 

The ABC-TV "Movie of the Week" 
and the 1970 series "The Immortal" 
were adapted from Jim's The Im- 
mortals. And The Immortal is his 
novelization of the pilot film screen- 
play. Jim summed up his experience 
with television and his opinions about 



science fiction on film in a recent ar- 
ticle in TV Guide. 

This Spring Bantam brought out a 
new edition of The Joy Makers. Dell 
will publish his new book. The Burn- 
ing, this summer; and Scribner's has 
contracted to publish The Listeners. 

Jim now is a full-time faculty 
member at the University of Kansas, 
from which he has two degrees and 
where he teaches fiction writing for 
the English department and a new 
course in science fiction as literature 
for the School of Journalism. He is 
working on a textbook about science 
fiction and putting on film a science- 
fiction course in which writers, edi- 
tors and other authorities discuss as- 
pects of the field they know best. He 
has a 90-year-old house, a 24-year-old 
marriage, two sons, 21 and 16, three 
Siamese cats and a dachshund. And 
if all that isn't enough, he was a 
candidate this year for president of 
the SFWA.

“How old are you?” he said. 

“Sixty-three,” I lied. 

I was close to sixty-eight. 

“1 got enough years left,” 1 said, 
“to want my name wrapped 
around them. Fifty thousand 
credits is a lot of money but it ain’t 
the same as a name.” 

“I could make it sixty,” he said. 
“But that’s my last offer.” 

Now sixty is only ten more than 
fifty and it shouldn’t have made 
that much difference to me but it 
did. I was mighty close to closing 
the deal at that point. But I had one 
more question to ask. 

“What will you do with my 
name if 1 sell it to you?” 

He frowned. 

“Do with it? I won’t do any- 
thing with it.” 

I must have looked terribly puz- 
zled because his brow clouded 
and then he began to laugh out 
loud. 

“I see what you mean,” he said. 
“You think that I’ll use it some 
way. Maybe bring disgrace on 
your name.” 

“Sully it, is what 1 was think- 
ing.” 

“1 just want to own it,” he said. 
“Some men accumulate real 
estate. Others want art objects or 
rare books. I like names. But it has 
to be mine, do you follow what 
I’m saying? The name has to 
belong to me. And when I take a 
fancy to it, I got to have it. And I 
pay the top price.” 



His eyes were all afire and his 
dark cheeks were gleaming with 
fresh sweat. He opened his wallet 
and counted out sixty thousand 
credits in fresh new bills. It was 
painful to look at all of that cash 
in one place. 

“I’ll take it,” I said and I felt 
dirty all over. 

A FTER the clerk had validated 
the form we shook hands. 

“It’s a good name,” I said. 
“Take care of it.” 

“I will,” he said, but he seemed 
to have lost interest. He was look- 
ing at another Terran with wrap- 
ped leggings around his ankles, 
who was walking down the dusty 
cobbled street. 

“Excuse me,” he said. “I see an- 
other prospect.” 

He shoved the validated form 
carelessly into his breast pocket 
and set out after the Terran. His 
tall thin body had come alive and 
his fingers were trembling slight- 
ly- 

“You didn’t say goodbye,” I 
called after him, bitterly. 

There were sixty thousand 
credits in my hand, too much to 
carry on my person. 1 went to the 
credit exchange to open an ac- 
count 

“In what name?” said the teller. 
He was even less startled than I 
was at the fresh tears that sud- 
denly spurted out of my eyes. ★

GALAXY 





REMEMBER well how he 
looked that day, at the peak of 
his powers and self-confidence, al- 
ready at thirty a world-renowned 
metal-people engineer — or, as we 
in the trade spoke about it at the 
great experiment center in that 
long-ago time, a peoplegeer. I re- 
call how his black wild hair tossed, 
how strands fell athwart his beady 
burning eyes when he, the honored 
guest, almost shrieked, addressing 
the world convention, “Did God 



build you and me? Yes! But in the 
beginning. Since then He has not 
lifted a hand. It was not needed.” 
Deafening applause from the as- 
sembled thousands of metal-people 
engineers rose up in thunderous 
sanction, smote agreement-noise 
violently at the young man on the 
stage. When the yells and the thun- 
dering hands had stilled a little we 
waited anxiously for his next 
words. His urgent staring about, 
his pleading manner of standing 




171 



with his hands cupped at us, all 
marked him as a man in the throes 
of a mission. “We are so far be- 
hind God,” he cried, “in the field 
of this science that we should be 
ashamed. Each night, on our knees, 
we should say, ‘God, I am ashamed, 
forgive me. I am sad that I have 
moved so slowly, been a dull me- 
tal-people engineer.’ But all shall 
soon be remedied by my plan. God 
never meant that we, year after 
year, should go on, tediously fash- 
ioning our servants. Man was 
meant for leisure times. And the 
contemplation of his body and its 
pleasure-needs. Gentlemen, it is 
my studied belief that in all the 
universe there is none to equal the 
pleasure potential of man in his 
flesh.” 

Applause crashed up and out 
from many beating palms and re- 
verberated like great deep drum- 
beats from the curves of the egg- 
shaped auditorium. 

“Now, to achieve more leisure 
time: In many central places we 
shall put our structures, buildings 
of a size to dwarf any yet attempt- 
ed. They will not be greatly tall, 
but they will cover many many 
acres, lying like gigantic metal 
orange halves on the flat places. In 
these we must store our parts. Or 
I should say, their parts.” He 
paused as if half expecting some 
recognition of humor. But there 
was never a titter. We were too 
tense for jest. 

“We must make the parts at 



first,” he went on, “as we have 
made the steel-folk. We shall store 
the parts so the buildings built like 
halves of oranges can be, in a man- 
ner of speaking, termed founts- 
of-life.” Angry mutterings of dis- 
appointment were beginning to 
come from the audience now. And 
one renowned metal-people engi- 
neer, who had once been a robot 
engineer and was much older 
than the young man on the stage, 
was heard to curse and say some- 
thing to the effect that the young 
fool was about to advocate a plan 
that had been tried more than thir- 
ty years ago, tried and found want- 
ing before this young fool was 
born. 

“Ah, no,” the young man pro- 
tested, as if sensing the nature of 
their disappointment. “I am not 
thinking of that ancient plan of the 
late Professor Blanochon. I am, 
of course, familiar with it — that 
stingy unimaginative scheme that 
called for self-repair of the worn 
or injured servants of another age, 
the unsophisticated robots. In that 
there was no progress, no imagina- 
tion, no grasp of the true problem. 
The robot, after a certain period 
of usually good service to man, 
grew in lassitude, his wires old, his 
plates and power wafers jaded. He 
made no honest attempt to re- 
pair himself well, wishing rather to 
die back to some easy junk yard. 
But my plan calls for a whole new 
deal for steel-folk. You might call 
it the steel-man’s chance for bliss,

his emancipation. But it also 
means the emancipation — finally 
the almost total emancipation — 
of man from the toil of making 
servants merely to— do I say mere- 
ly? nay, boundlessly — receive the 
services of servants. TO GIVE 
MAN MORE LEISURE TIME!” 
The last sentence was grandly 
shouted. 



T HE applause rose and became 
prolonged. We stood at our 
seats and danced. We were with 
this man! When the bedlam had 
ceased a little he went on. He out- 
lined his plan while the huge con- 
clave of world metal-people engi- 
neers held to the edges of their 
seats. The entire working force of 
present day steel-folk, he explained, 
must be scrapped — junked as out 
of date. In the new population of 
servants, to be created by the en- 
gineers, there must be the sexes, 
three, or perhaps more correctly 
two true sexes and one work-horse 
nonsex which could, after certain 
nonsex service in the warehouse, 
be elevated to a sex. (Upon the ele- 
vation of a nonsex a sex would 
necessarily be demoted in the ro- 
tation necessary to keep the ware- 
house force and the sex groups at 
stable strength). Designations for 
the three groups would be hes, ses 
and hese. A hes would have his 
power unit on the right side of his 
chest; a ses would have hers on the 
left side; and a hese, the nonsex, 



would display the power unit in 
the middle of the chest. 

On a day determined by local 
conditions, the quality and quan- 
tity of the work force and perhaps 
other considerations, best under- 
stood by the metal-people engi- 
neer in charge, all the hes and ses 
of a given district would be called 
together. Under the watchful su- 
pervision of the ranking engineer 
of that particular community each 
hes and ses would be required to 
remove a certain one of his or her 
power wafers from the power unit. 
On a gleaming steel table, per- 
fectly bare except for a few carved 
signs of erotic significance to steel- 
folk (such as steel-shaving flowers 
bloomed on intricate balance- 
stems amidst lance-shaped bees 
without wings and iron balls mated, 
represented as whirling two-and- 
two in a perfectly clear, colorless 
oil) the wafers would be placed 
in two heaps, the hes wafers in 
one, the ses wafers in another. 
Then, with careful tabulation by 
the ranking peoplegeer, the hes and 
ses would file by the mating table 
and each be handed a wafer from 
the opposite-sex heap. To hasten 
the mechanics of mating, as a 
check and to keep everything de- 
cently routine, a peoplegeer-in- 
charge-of-love, merely a clerk- 
lieutenant sent from the central 
offices to assist the head people- 
geer of the district, would call 
out sex and numbers of correctly 
matched pairs, usually calling out

the hes number first. For instance 
he would sing out, “Hes Twenty 
must have ses Ten-nine-six-four’s 
love wafer and vice versa.” And so 
it would go until all the pairs cho- 
sen for love at this particular call- 
up were correctly ready for mat- 
ing. (Yes, it does seem rather a 
shabby and shallow plan-of-love 
and many a better one — and at 
least one worse one — at once come 
to mind. But I give you this plan 
exactly as outlined to that great 
conclave by the genius with wild 
dark hair and beady, flashing eyes.) 

Their part of courtship over in 
a prearranged matching of wafers, 
hes 20 and ses 10964 would repair 
to a little cubicle out of sight of 
everyone and soon would come to 
vib-reactors of breathless eaves- 
droppers a tiny tink-tink sound; 
perhaps the listeners would feel 
a pleasant anticipatory thrill deep 
in the chambers of their own most 
delicate wires and plates, knowing 
that one happy pair were already 
toying with each other’s power sec- 
tions and exchanging wafers. 
When the lovers reappeared there 
might be wild metallic cheers or 
merely hoarse huzzas or perhaps 
just the blinking of bulb-eyes to 
show appreciation of a solemn oc- 
casion and a joyful one. But hes 
20 and ses 10964 couldn’t care less 
because they would be in love now 
and they would hurry off to the 
great "metal building shaped like 
half an orange. There they would 
confront the workhorse hese. Per- 



haps he would say, “Gob doy, 
congrootulotions, yoy yoy!” Or 
if he were old and tired from his 
warehouse chores he might simply 
blink his bulbs and ask them to 
get on with it. 

“Oh, see them,” our speaker 
cried, carried away by his dream, 
“enter the steellov room, a place 
filled with those wonder-things we 
may term love objects of steel- 
folk.” The black wild hair shook 
down, the eyes gleamed. “Steel 
balls balance on jets of rainbow- 
colored gas there to swing the 
steel lover’s waltz constantly 
through the room; robot puppets 
of finest thread-wire and new-met- 
al cavort unceasingly on a stage of 
ever-changing lights. And over all 
wafts an atmosphere of tiny ro- 
bot-calipers interminably measur- 
ing lengths amidst the lance bees 
gently whirling in a clear cool 
light that does seem to shine be- 
yond forever. From the lovers the 
unexplained sounds! Ah, it may 
be only earnest conversation. They 
emerge! They tell the hese what 
they have decided to do! He goes 
to the proper stack and picks out 
the proper frame. He gives them a 
steel-bound book of instructions 
—all the things, each detailed step, 
to rear the little frame right. And 
on the book’s last page the frame 
stands whole, all his gleaming 
parts together, all the detail su- 
perimposed. 

And under the picture appears 
this little verse: 



174 



GALAXY 




You held the future in my 
lacks; 

Think! Did you visit all 
the right stacks? 

‘‘Gentlemen, picture the inward 
glow, which no steel-person could 
have experienced in the old days, 
when the happy pair clank off 
around the warehouse, the bare 
frame clasped between them. And 
know that these good steel par- 
ents are determined to visit all the 
right stacks and rear a sturdy ac- 
curately constructed steel-person 
according to the book. And they 
will do it! Then, the job finished, 
they will leave their creation at the 
warehouse — whether a hes a ses 
or a hese — for further disposition. 
Tomorrow, back to work — end of 
happy useful marriage — end of 
happy useful love ... for a time 
. until next call-up . according 
to local conditions . quality and 
quantity of the work force . date 
set by metal-people engineer.” 

E VEN now, here in my extreme 
leisure on this high mountain 
top where no hes or ses or hese 
has yet come, I can see him and, 
calling up the dark vision, I can 
hear him crying, Did God build 
you and me? Yes! But in the be- 
ginning. Since then He has not lift- 
ed a hand ... I can hear hear 
him pleading for man’s leisure as 
on that great day when he spoke 
before the assembled giants of 
steel-folk engineering. But across 



his words a strange sound pounds 
me, nearer and nearer — like rocks 
on metal sheets and metal balls on 
stone. Yes, the warehouses are 
climbing the mountains; the steel- 
folk come chanting a song of 
happy love-power, their metal foot- 
steps on the level places sounding 
like little pile drivers walking free, 
their scratchy holds on the sheer 
mountain stones sounding like cats 
whetting claws. In the Old Days 
. But I must not regard them in 
other than their true light. They 
are not angry; they are merely 
coming to work. They will whirl 
stones away like pebbles, dig 
holes that swallow hills — and they 
will level the mountain to build a 
new warehouse. You see, they are 
forced to expand because love has 
been strong. Almost from the first 
they saw no cause to wait for call- 
up by a metal-people engineer. 
And though many frames have 
been born out of wedlock and 
many a stack has been visited in 
sheer excess of free love, the steel- 
folk have prospered. And now 
they are crowding me — the last 
engineer, the last flesh-man, the 
last human being on earth — from 
the last mountain top of my world. 
Oh, they will not, I feel sure, even 
notice me waiting here amid more 
leisure — and terror— than any 

other man knew. I think they 
must stoop and whirl me from the 
mountain as of no use, as though I 
were a resting stone.

The doctor told me,"Marguerite, you can be alive and ugly, 

or beautiful and dead” 



The day I first noticed the small pink spot on my 
cheek, I had other things on my mind. The New York 
papers said, “Marguerite Piazza opens at the Persian 
Room". I covered the spot with makeup, walked out 
into the spotlight, and forgot it— forgot everything— 
in the joy of singing. 

It wasn't until the spot began to spread, that I went 
to a cancer specialist. The day the doctor told me I'd 
have to have radical face surgery, I was sure my career 
was over. It was no longer a matter of saving my looks. 
Just of saving my life. 

They kept the mirrors in my hospital room covered 
for a week. And yet today, thanks to the fantastic skill 



of the surgeons, I sing in the spotlight again. I let myself 
be photographed full-face by a famous photographer 
of glamorous women. And I am alive. 

So now you know why I am appealing to you on 
behalf of the American Cancer Society. To give money. 
To get regular checkups. And to pay attention to can- 
cer's warning signals.
