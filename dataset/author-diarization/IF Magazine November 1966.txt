“We’re looking for people 
who want to write” 



By Gordon Carroll 

Director, Famous Writers School, Former 
editor, Reader's Digest, Time, Inc., Coronet 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
I would like to test your writing aptitude. 
We’ll help you find out if you can be 
trained to become a successful writer. 

Several years ago, we started the 
Famous Writers School. Our aim was to 
help qualified people acquire the skills 
they need to break into print. We poured 
everything we knew about writing into 
a new kind of professional training 
course, which you take at home and in 
your free time. After a solid grounding 
in fundamentals, you get advanced train- 
ing in the specialty of your choice— Fic- 
tion, Non-Fiction, Advertising or Busi- 
ness Writing. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers or editors. 
Your instructor spends up to two hours 
analyzing your work. He blue-pencils 
corrections right on it — much as an 
editor does with established writers. 
Then he returns it to you with a long 
personal letter of advice and specific 
recommendations. 

This training works well. Our students 
have sold their writing to more than 100 



publications including Readers Digest, 
True, Redbook. 

Stephen Novak of Wayne, N. J., says, 
“I just received a check from Ellery 
Queen* s Mystery Magazine. That’s 1 1 
stories sold in six months.” Doris Steb- 
bins of S. Coventry, Conn., who has sold 
six stories to Woman's Day for $2,050 
writes, “Taking your Course has made 
it all possible.” 

Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you can benefit from this 
training, send for the School’s Aptitude 
Test. If you test well, or offer other evi- 
dence of writing ability you may enroll. 
But there is no obligation to do so.

ABOUT SCIENTISTS 



I n the official org*an of the Science 
Fiction Writers of America 
there’s an article by a scientist, 
commenting on the descriptions of 
how scientists think, talk and act 
in science-fiction stories. (You’ll be 
glad to know we came off pretty 
well — particularly such scientists 
as Doc Smith’s “Skylark” Seaton, 
who gets high marks as a repre- 
sentative of the breed.) 

Probably sf readers know a lot 
more than the general public about 
what scientists are all about, if 
only because so many of them are 
scientists (or, if still undergradu- 
ates, proto-scientists) themselves. 
But a batch of new books that have 
come across our desk recently give 
some interesting additional lights. 
Science-fiction writers will find 
them invaluable; the rest of us will 
find them just fascinating reader- 
ing. 

Scientists in government, Ralph 
E. Lapp’s The New Priesthood 
(Harper & Row) has a lot to tell 
us about the Manhattan Project and 
its later ramifications. Not surpris- 
ingly, the burden of the message 
has to do with the failure of com- 
munication between scientists and; 
politicians. (Were Einstein, Szilard'* 
and the other instigators of the 
atomic-bomb research project anx- 
ious to create a new super-weapon? 
Apparently not. Lapp’s book makes 
it clear that their primary concern 



was that Nazi Glermany might de- 
velop the weapon, and their urging 
of a U.S. program was viewed as 
a counter-measure. When the war 
against (Germany ended they lost 
much of their steam, even though 
Japan was still fighting — since 
Japan was only a conventional mili- 
tary enemy, not likely to come up 
with nuclear weapons. But the 
government officials, of course, took 
a simpler view: a weapon was a 
weapon, and the purpose of it was 
to employ it in warfare.) From this 
lack of mutual understanding arose 
endless troubles. Scientists disliked 
and were ingenious in trying to find 
ways around the barriers of secrecy. 
To the military in charge of the 
atomic project, this was dangerous 
and irreligious behavior; but the 
scientists were at least as unhappy 
with the necessity for it — Leo 
Szilard thought the bomb would 
have been operational as early as 
the spring of 1944 without the rigid 
secrecy that kept people in one 
laboratory from learning that people 
in another laboratory had already 
solved their problem. Even after the 
war, scientists and politicians still 
were unable to communicate. Scien- 
tists were shocked when General 
Groves ordered three captured Jap- 
anese research cyclotrons dumped 
into the Pacific Ocean — they knew 
the difference between a laboratory 
tool and an armament plant, and 
couldn’t see why everyone else didn’t 
know it too. When U.S. scientists

dertected the first Russian nuclear 
explosion a special group of their 
most famous men briefed President 
Truman on it — and did it so badly 
that even years later, Truman was 
still in doubt as to whether the ex* 
plosion had ever happened. 

A couple decades later in the 
story, we find Daniel Lang’s An 
Inquiry into Enoughness (McGraw- 
Hill). The dialogue is broadened 
here, and we find that the problems 
of communcation between scientists 
and politicians in America are 
matched by the problems of com- 
munication between both classes in 
this country and their opposite 
numbers on the other side of the 
Iron Curtain. Lang attended one 
of the Pugwash conferences in Dub- 
rovnik, Yugoslavia, where U.S. and 
U.S.S.R. scientists, impatient with 
the failures of their political lead- 
ers, tried to get together on nuclear 
disarmament plans. But they made 
little headway, even on so simple a 
part of the problem as settling on 
a reasonable number of on-site in- 
spections to enforce a test ban. A 
Russian named Artsimovich report- 
ed how — 

— a small group of Russian 
and American scientists had 
gone off by themselves, de- 
termined to lick the problem on 
a strictly scientific basis. But 
it hadn’t worked. The Russians’ 
calculations had led them to 
the conclusion that one insjwc- 
tion annually would be suffi- 
cient; the Americans had come 
up with fifty as their figure. 
Both answers could be defended 
scientifically, Artsimovich said, 
depending on how suspicious 
one considered ‘‘suspicious 
events”. If one wanted each 



and every suspicious event in- 
vestigiated, he explained, that 
would mean from fifty to sev- 
enty inspections, but if one as- 
sumed, as most scientists did, 
that only a series of under- 
ground tests could have mili- 
tary significance, then the num- 
ber of inspections need be no- 
where near that high. “There 
is no simple relationship be- 
tween the number of inspec- 
tions, on the one hand, end the 
number of suspicious events, on 
the other,” Artsimovich told 
Working Group 6. “That is 
what the scientific point of 
view shows us. Everything de- 
pends not on jointly improving 
detection techniques but on 
trust and confidence.” 

But in Lang’s book, as indeed in 
Lapp’s, there are signs that the 
opposing parties are beginning, 
however haltingly, to learn each 
other’s language. “Trust and con- 
fidence” are abstractions, but the 
scientists are learning to quantify 
them — even to buttress them by 
technology. In that view, the “hard- 
ening” of our missile installations, 
marking them near-invulnerable to 
enemy attack, is in fact a contribu- 
tion to “trust and confidence” be- 
cause there is nothing like the knowl- 
edge that an opponent can retaliate 
to cause sober second thoughts be- 
fore rash action. Lang quotes an 
official of the Defense Department 
in that connection : “Our gain in se- 
curity doesn’t necessarily imply a 
concomitant Soviet loss. That is the 
great distinction of all arms-con- 
trol measures that aren’t phony. 
They make for a mutual security. 
And if the Russians achieve sur- 
vivability of their strategic mis-

IF 




siles, which might be in the next 
few years, the arms race may be 
further stabilized.” 

Of course, this is the stability 
that Oppenheimer compared to “two 
scorpions in a bottle” . but if 
“trust and confidence” are enhanced 
it seems likely enough that it is 
enough stability to keep us all alive. 

Scientists in history, William C. 
Vergara’s Science, the Never-End- 
ing Quest (Harper & Row) starts 
with Eratosthenes and ends with 
Rutherford and Fermi; (that’s two 
thousands years and a bit, or rough- 
ly five years to a page, and natural- 
ly some of the by-ways of the march 
of science have got smoothed over 
or overlooked. But surprisingly little 
is left out, at that, in this account 
of the changes in men’s scientific 
thought in the Age of Science, and 
of the men who made the (great dis- 
coveries. 

Written to a smaller compass, 
but correspondingly rich in detail 
(and blessed with a graceful prose 
style and a knack for description), 
Barbara Lovett Cline’s The Ques- 
tioners (Crowell) is one of the most 
rewarding books we’ve seen in some 
time. This is the story of the physi- 
cists whose joint monument is the 
quantum theory — Bohr and Pauli, 
Rutherford and Planck, Einstein and 
Heisenberg. The time is half a cen- 
tury ago, when the world seemed 
simpler and scientists were certainly 
poorer (their usual mode of trans- 
portation, Miss Cline records, was 
third-class rail carriages; they lived 
in small rooms and dormitories; 
their chief amusement was talk). 
Miss Cline is successful in descrilnng 
what these men thought and how 
their views changed the face of 
physics, but for most of us what 



will stand out is the personalities 
involved — Dirac, who when asked 
if he took sugar in his tea was sur- 
prised to be further asked how 
many spoonsful ; “sugar” was a 
quantum unit to him, implying one 

spoonful. Or Pauli, picking out 

scientific flaws in Jules - Verne’s 
early sf novels and telling his in- 
structors they were idiots. Or Niels 
Bohr, skiing in Norway and brood- 
ing over Schrodinger’s wave equa- 
tions on the slopes. Or Gamow’s 

practical jokes and cartoons, or 

Rutherford excitedly proclaiming the 
virtues of “the most wonderful in- 
strument in scientific history”, Wil- 
son’s newly invented cloud chamber. 



Scientists studying themselves. In 
a Columbia University Press book 
edited by Aaron W. Warner, Dean 
Morse and Alfred S. Teichner, The 
Impact of Science on Technology, 
we can get some revealing insights 
into what scientisits think of them- 
selves, each other and the work they 
do. I. I. Rabi, for example, on the 
space program: “Scientifically the 
moon is not a very interesting sub- 
ject. It’s nowhere near the center 
of science. I think it comes more 
under the heading of exploration. 
The fact is that the space program 
does not get the best people. It’s 
just something which is going on 
in the basement. It’s using a lot of 
material. It provides headlines. But 
actually, it has only peripheral 
scientific interest, except for astron- 
omers.” 

All interesting books, about in- 
teresting people, doing interesting 
things. We think you’ll enjoy them 
as much as we did.

The war couldn't be stopped; Earth's 
diplomats couldn't be saved . but 
nobody had explained that to Retief! 



1 

F irst Secretary Jame Retief of the 
Terran Embassy pushed open 
the conference room door and duck- 
ed as a rain of plaster chips clattered 
down from the ceiling. T^e chande- 
lier, a baroque construction of Yal- 
can glasswork, danced on its chain 



and then fell with a crash on the 
center of the polished greenwood 
table. Across the room, drapes flut- 
tered at glassless windows which 
rattled in their frames in resonance 
with the distant crump-crump! of 
gunfire. 

“Mr. Retief, you’re ten minutes 
late for staff meeting!” a voice 



sounded from somewhere. He stoop- 
ed, glanced under the table. A hud- 
dle of eyes stared back. 

“Ah, there you are, Mr. Am- 
bassador, gentlemen,” Retief greeted 
the Chief of Mission and his staff. 
“Sorry to be tardy, but there was 
a brisk little aerial dogfight going 
on just over the Zoological Gardens. 
The Gloys are putting up a hot re- 
sistance to the Blort landings this 
time.” 

“And no doubt you paused to haz- 
ard a wager on the outcome,” Am- 
bassador Biteworse snapped. “Your 
mission, sir, was to deliver a sharp 
rebuke to the Foreign Office re- 
garding the latest violations of the 
Embassy! What have you to report?” 

“The Foreign Minister sends his 
regrets. He was just packing up to 
leave. It looks as though the Blorts 
will be reoccupying the capital about 
dinner time.” 

“What, again? Just as Fm on the 
verge of re-establishing a working 
rapport with his Excellency?” 

“Oh, but you have a dandy rap- 
port with his Blortian Excellency, 
loo.” The voice of Counsellor of 
Embassy Magnan sounded from his 
position well to the rear of the 
group sheltered under the long 
board. “Remember, you were just 
about to get him to agree to a limited 
provisional preliminary symbolic par- 
tial -ceasefire covering left-handed 
bloop guns of calibre .25 and below!” 

“Fm aware of the status of the 
peace talks!” Biteworse cut him off. 
The peppery diplomat emerged, rose 
and dusted off the knees of his pink 
and green-striped satin knee-breech- 
es, regulation early afternoon semi- 



informal dress for top three graders 
of the Corps Diplomatique Ter- 
restrienne on duty on prenuclear 
worlds. 

“Well, I suppose we must make 
the best of it.” He glared at his 
advisors as they followed his lead, 
ranged themselves at the table 
around the shattered remains of the 
chandelier, while the chatter and 
rumble of gunfire continued out- 
side. “Gentlemen, in the nine months 
since this Mission was accredited 
here on Plushnik II, we’ve seen the 
capital change hands four times. Un- 
der such conditions, the shrewdest 
diplomacy is powerless to bring to 
fruition our schemes for the pacifi- 
cation of the system. Nevertheless, 
today’s dispatch from Sector HQ 
indicates that unless observable re- 
sults are produced prior to the up- 
coming visit of the Inspectors, a 
drastic reassessment of personnel re- 
quirements may result — and Fm 
sure you know what that means!” 

“Ummm. We’ll all be fired.” 
Magnan brightened at a thought. 
“Unless, perhaps, your Excellency 
points out that after all, as Chief of 
Mission, you’re the one . .” He 
paused as he noted the expression 
on the Biteworse features. “The one 
who suffered most,” he finished 
weakly. 

“I need not remind you,” the Am- 
bassador bored on relentlessly, “that 
alibis fail to impress visiting inspec- 
tion teams! Results, gentlemen! 
Those are what count! Now, what 
proposals do I hear for new ap- 
proaches to the problem of ending 
this fratricidal war which even 
now ...”

T he Ambassadorial tones were 
drowned by the deep-throated 
snarl of a rapidly approaching in- 
ternal combustion engine. Glancing 
out the window, Relief saw a bright 
blue, twin-winged aircraft coming in 
from the northwest at tree-top level, 
a vivid darting form outlined against 
the sky-filling disc of the planet’s 
sister world, Plushnik I. The late- 
afternoon sun glinted from the craft’s 
polished wooden propeller blades. 
Its cowl-mounted machine guns 
sparkled as they hosed a stream of 
tracers into the street below. 

“Take cover!” the military at- 
tache barked and dived for the ta- 
ble. At the last instant, the fighter 
plane banked sharply up, executed 
a flashy slow roll and shot away, 
out of sight behind the chipped tile 
dome of the Temple of Erudition 
across the park. 

“This is too much!” Biteworse 
shrilled from his position behind a 
bullet-riddled filing cabinet. “That 
was an open, overt attack on the 
Chancellery! A flagrant violation of 
interplanetary law!” 

“Actually, I think he was after a 
Gloian armored column in the 
park,” Relief said. “All we got was 
the overkill.” 

“Inasmuch as you happen to be 
standing up, Mr. Relief,” Biteworse 
called, “I’ll thank you to put a call 
through on the hot line to Lib Glip 
at the Secretariat. I’ll lodge a pro- 
test that will make his caudal cilia 
stand on end!” 

Relief pressed buttons on the com- 
pact CDT-issue field rig which had 
been installed to link the Embassy 
to the local governmental offices. 



Behind him. Ambassador Biteworse 
addressed the staff: 

“Now, while it’s necessary to im- 
press on the Premier the impropriety 
of shooting up a Terran Mission, 
we must hold something in reserve 
for future atrocities. I think we’ll 
play the scene using a modified For- 
mula Nine image: Kindly Indulgence 
tinged with Latent Firmness, which 
may at any moment crystallize into 
Reluctant Admonition, with appro- 
priate overtones of Gracious Con- 
descension.” 

“How would you feel about a 
dash of Potential Impatience, with 
maybe just a touch of Appropriate 
Reprisals?” the Military Attache 
suggested. 

“We don’t want to antagonize 
anyone with premature saber-rattling. 
Colonel,” Biteworse frowned a re- 
buke. 

“Hmm.” Magnan pulled at his 
lower lip. “A masterful approach 
as you’ve outlined it, your Excel- 
lency. But I wonder if we mightn’t 
add just the teeniest hint of Ago- 
nizing Reappraisal?” 

Biteworse nodded approvingly. 
“Yes. An element of the traditional 
might be quite in order.” 

A moment later the screen cleared 
to reveal a figure lolling in an 
easy chair, splendidly 9lad in an ir- 
ridescent Bromo-seltzer blue tunic, 
open over an exposed framework 
of leathery-looking ribs from which 
gaily-be-jeweled medals dangled in 
rows. From the braided collar, 
around which a leather strap was 
slung supporting a pair of heavy 
Japanese-made binoculars, a stout

neck extended, adorned along its 
length with varicolored patches rep- 
resenting auditory, olfactory and ra- 
dar organs, as well as a number of 
other senses the nature of which 
was still unclear to Terr an physiolo- 
gists. At the tip of the stem, a trio 
of heavy-lidded eyes stared piercing- 
ly at the diplomats. 

“General Barf!” Biteworse ex- 
claimed. “But I was calling the Pre- 
mier! How — what — ” 

“Evening, Hector,” the general 
said briskly. “I made it a point to 
seize the Secretariat first, this trip.” 
He brought his vocalizing organ up 
on the end of its tentacle to place 
it near the audio pick-up. “I’ve been 
meaning to give you a ring, but I’ll 
be damned if I could remember how 
to operate this thing.” 

“General,” Biteworse cut in sharp- 
ly. “I’ve grown accustomed to a 
certain amount of glass breakage dur- 
ing these, ah, readjustment periods, 
but — ” 

“I warned you against flimsy con- 
struction,” the general countered. 
“And I assure you. I’m always care- 
ful to keep that sort of thing at a 
minimum. After all, there’s no tell- 
ing who’ll be using the facilities 
next, eh?” 

“But this is an entirely new cate- 
gory of outrage!” Biteworse bored 
on. “I’ve just been bombed and 
strafed by one of your aircraft! The 
scoundrel practically flew into the 
room! It’s a miracle I survived!” 

“Now, Hector, you know there 
are no such things as miracles,” the 
Blortian officer chuckled easily. 
“There’s a perfectly natural explana- 
tion of your survival, even if it does 



seem a bit hard to understand at 
first glance.” 

“This is no time to haggle over 
metaphysics!” Biteworse shook a 
finger at the screen. “I demand an 
immediate apology, plus assurances 
that nothing of the sort will occur 
again until after my transfer!” 

“Sorry, Hector,” the general said 
calmly. “I’m afraid I can’t guaran- 
tee that a few wild rounds won’t be 
coming your way during the course 
of the night. This isn’t a mere Com- 
mando operation this time. Now that 
I’ve secured my beachhead. I’m ready 
to launch my full-scale Spring Of- 
fensive for the recovery of our 
glorious homeland. Jumpoff will be 
in approximately eight hours from 
now; so if you’d care to synchronize 
chronometers — ” 

“An all-out offensive? Aimed at 
this area?” 

“You have a fantastic grasp of tac- 
tics,” Barf said admiringly. “I intend 
to occupy the North Continent first, 
after which I’ll roll up the Gloian 
Divisions like carpets in all direc- 
tions.” 

“But — my Chancellery is situ- 
ated squarely in the center of the 
capital! You’ll be carrying your as- 
sault directly across the Embassy 
grounds!” 

“Well, Hector, I seem to recall 
it was you who selected the site for 
your quarters.” 

“I asked for neutral ground!” 
Biteworse shrilled. “I was assigned 
the most fought-over patch on the 
planet!” 

“What could be more neutral than 
no man’s land?” General Barf in* 
quired in a reasonable tone.

V-J to Retief. “Barf sounds as 
though he may be harboring some 
devious motivation behind that open 
countenance.” 

“Maybe he has a few techniques 
of his own,” Retief suggested. “This 
might be his version of the Number 
Twenty-three Leashed Power gambit, 
with a side order of Imminent 
Spontaneous Rioting.” 

“Heavens, do you suppose . .? 
But he hasn’t had time to learn the 
finer nuances. He’s only been in the 
business for a matter of months.” 
“Perhaps it’s just a natural apti- 
tude for diplomacy.” 

“That’s possible. I’ve observed the 
instinctive fashion in which he dis- 
tinguishes the bonded whiskey at 
cocktail parties.” 

“. immediate cessation of hos- 
tilities!” the Ambassador was de- 
claring. “Now, I have a new formula, 
based on the battle lines of the tenth 
day of the third week of the Moon 
of Limitless Imbibing, as modified 
by the truce team’s proposals of the 
second week of the Moon of Cease- 
less Complaining, up-dated in accor- 
dance wifh Corps Policy Number 
746358-b, as amended — ” 

“That’s thoughtful of you, Hec- 
tor.” Barf held up a tactile member 
in a restraining gesture. “But as it 
happens, inasmuch as this will be the 
final campaign of the War for Lib- 
eration of the Homeland, peace- 
making efforts become nugatory.” 

“I seem to recall similar predic- 
tions at the time of the Fall Cam- 
paign, the pre-Winter Offensive, the 



Winter Counter-offensive, the Post- 
Winter Anschluss and the Pre-Spring 
Push.” Biteworse retorted. “Why 
don’t you reconsider, General, be- 
fore incurring a new crop of need- 
less casualties?” 

“Hardly needless. Hector. You 
need a few casualties to sharpen up 
discipline. And in any case, this 
time things will be different. I’m 
using a new technique of saturation 
leaflet bombing followed by inten- 
sive Victory parades, guaranteed to 
crumble all resistance. If you’ll just 
sit tight — ” 

“Sit tight, and have the building 
blown down about my ears?” Bite- 
worse cut in. “I’m leaving for the 
provinces at once.” 

“I think that would be unwise. 
Hector, with conditions so unsettled. 
Better stay where you are. In fact, 
you may consider that an order, un- 
der the provisions of martial law. If 
this seems a trifle harsh, remember, 
it’s all in a good cause. And now I 
have to be moving along. Hector. 

I have a new custom-built VIP model 
armored car with air and music 
that I’m dying to test drive. Ta-ta.” 
The screen blanked abruptly. 

4 4'"T^his is fantastic!” The Ambas- 
A sador stared around at his 
staff for corroboration of his assess- 
ment of the situation. “In the past, 
the opposing armies have at least 
made a pretense of respecting diplo- 
matic privilege. Now they’re openly 
proposing to make us the center of 
a massive combined land, sea and 
air strike!” 

“We’ll have to contact Lib Glip 
at once,” the Political Officer said

urgently. “Perhaps we can convince 
him that the capital should be de- 
clared an open city.” 

“Sound notion, Oscar,” the Am- 
bassador agreed. He mopped at his 
forehead with a large monogrammed 
tissue. “Retief, keep trying until you 
reach him.” 

Half a minute later, the circular 
visage of the Gloian Foreign Minis- 
ter appeared on the screen, against 
a background of passing shopfronts 
seen through a car window. Two 
bright black eyes peered through a 
tangle of thick tendrils not unlike a 
tangerine-dyed oil mop, capped by a 
leather Lindy cap with goggles. 

“Hi, fellows,” he greeted the Ter- 
rans airily. “Sorry to break our lunch 
date, Biteworse, but you know how 
foreign affairs are. Here today and 
gone to dinner, as the saying goes, 1 
think. But never mind that. What 1 
really called you about was — ” 

“It was I who called you\" the 
Ambassador broke in. “See here. Lib 
Clip. A highly placed confidential 
source has advised me that the capital 
is about to become the objective of 
an all-out Blort assault. Now, I think 
it only fair that your people should 
relinquish the city peaceably, so as 
to avoid a possible interplanetary in- 
cident.” 

“Oh, that big-mouth Barf has been 
at you again, eh? Well, relax, fellows. 
Everything’s going to be okay. I 
have a surprise in store for those 
indigo indigents.” 

“You’ve decided to propose a un- 
ilateral cease-fire?” Biteworse blurt- 
ed. “A magnificent gesture — ” 

“Are you kidding, Biteworse? 
Show the white feather while those 



usurpers are still in full possession of 
our hallowed mother world?” The 
Gloian leaned into the screen, “ril 
let you in on a little secret. The re- 
treat is just a diversionary measure 
to suck Barf into over extending his 
lines. As soon as he’s poured all his 
available reinforcements into this dry 
run — whammo! I hit him with a 
nifty hidden-ball play around left 
end and land a massive expedition- 
ary force on Blort! At one blow, I’ll 
regain the cradle of the Gloian race 
and end the war once and for all!” 
“I happen to be directly in the 
path of your proposed dry run!” 
Biteworse keened. “I remind you, sir, 
this compound is neither Gloian nor 
Blortian soil, but Terran!” A patch 
of plaster fell with a clatter as if to 
emphasize the point. 

44^^h, we won’t actually bombard 
the Chancellery itself. At 
least not intentionally. Unless, that 
is, Barf’s troops try to use it as a 
sanctuary. I suggest you go down 
into the sub-basement; some of you 
may come through with hardly a 
scratch.” 

“Wait! We’ll evacuate! I hereby 
call upon you for safe-conduct — ” 
“Sorry. I’ll be too busy checking 
out on the controls of my new hand- 
tooled pursuit craft to arrange trans- 
port to the South Pole just now. 
However, after the offensive — ” 
“You — you’ll be manning a 
fighter personally?” 

“Yes, indeed! A beaut. Everything 
on it but a flush John. I handle the 
portfolio of Defense Minister in the 
War Cabinet personally, you know. 
And a leader’s place is with his

troops at the front. Maybe not actu- 
ally at the front,” he amended. “But 
in the ge'neral area, you know.” 
“Isn’t that a little dangerous?” 
“Not if my G-4 reports are on 
the ball. Brides, I said this was an 
all-out effort.” 

“But that’s what you said the last 
time, when you were learning how 
to operate that leather-upholstered 
tank you had built!” 

“True. But this time it will be 
all-out all-out. And now 1 have to 
scoot or I’ll have to flip my own 
prop. You won’t hear from me again 
until after the victory, since I’m im- 
posing total communications silence 
now for the duration. Ciao'' The 
alien broke the connection. 

“Great galloping • galaxies!” Bite- 
worse sank into a plaster-dusted 
chair. “This is catastrophic! The 
Embassy will be devastated, and we’ll 
be buried in the rubble!” 

There was a discreet tap at the 
conference room door; it opened, 
and an apologetic junior officer peer- 
ed in. “Ah . Mr. Ambassador. A 
person is here, demanding to see 
you at once. I’ve explained to 
him — ” 

CCQtep aside, junior,” a deep voice 
O growled. A short, thick-set 
man in wrinkled blues thrust through 
the door. 

“I’ve got an Operational Instan- 
taneous Utter Top Secret dispatch for 
somebody.” He stared around at the 
startled diplomats. “Who’s in 
charge?” 

“I am,” Biteworse barked. “These 
are my staff. Captain. What’s this 
dispatch all about?” 



“Beats me. I’m Merchant Service. 
Some Navy brass hailed me and 
asked me to convoy it in. Said it 
was important.” He extracted a 
pink emergency message-form from 
a pouch and passed it across to Bite- 
worse. 

“Captain, perhaps you’re unaware 
that I have two emergencies and a 
crisis on my hands already!” Bite- 
worse looked indignant. 

The sailor glanced around the 
room. “From the looks of this place, 
I’d say you had a problem, all right, 
Mister,” he agreed. “I ran into a 
few fireworks myself, on the way in 
here. Looks like Chinese New ’Year 
out there.” 

“What’s the nature of the new 
emergency?” Magnan craned to read 
the paper in Biteworse’s hand. 

“Gentlemen, this is the end,” 
Biteworse said hollowly, looking up 
from the message - form. “The In- 
spectors are ahead of schedule. 
They’ll be here first thing in the 
morning.” 

“My, just in time to catch the 
action,” Magnan said. 

“Don’t sound so complacent, you 
imbecile!” Biteworse yelped. “That 
will be the final straw! An inspection 
team, here to assess the effectiveness 
of my pacification efforts, will be 
treated to the sight of a full-scale 
battle raging about my very door- 
step!” 

“Maybe we could tell them it’s just 
the local Water Festival.” 

“Silence!” Biteworse screeched. 
“Time is running out, sir! Unless 
we find a solution before dawn our 
careers will end in ignominy!” 

“If you don’t mind sharing space

with a cargo of Abalonian blue-fish 
eggs, you can come with me,” the 
merchantman offered over a re- 
newed rumble of artillery. “It will 
only be for a couple of months, un- 
til I touch down at Adobe. I hear 
they’ve got a borax mining camp 
there where you can work out your 
board until the Spring barge convoy 
shows up.” 

“Thank you,” Biteworse said cold- 
ly. “I shall keep your offer in mind.” 
“Don’t wait too long. I’m leaving 
as soon as I’ve off-loaded.” 

“All right, gentlemen,” the Ambas- 
sador said in an ominous tone after 
the captain had departed in search 
of coffee. “I’m ordering the entire 
staff to the cellars for the dura- 
tion of the crisis. No one is to at- 
tempt to leave the building, of 
course. We must observe Barf’s cur- 
few. We’ll be burning the midnight 
fluorescents tonight. And if by sun- 
rise we haven’t evolved a brilliant 
scheme for ending the war, you 
may all compose suitable letters of 
resignation — those of you who sur- 
vive!” 

Ill 

I n the corridor, Retief encountered 
his local clerk-typist, just donning 
a floppy beret dyed a sour orange 
as an expression of his political 
alignment. 

“Hi, Mr. Retief,” he greeted the 
diplomat glumly. “I was just leaving. 
I guess you know the Blorts are 
back in town.” 

“So it appears, Dil Snop. How 
about a stirrup cup before you go?” 
“Sure. They won’t have the 



streets cordoned off for a while yet.” 

In Retief’s office, the clerk parked 
his bulging briefcase and accepted a 
three-finger shot of black Bacchus 
brandy, which he carefully poured 
into a pocket like a miniature mar- 
supial’s pouch. He heaved a deep 
sigh. “Say, Mr. Retief, when that 
Blue incompetent shows up, tell him 
not to mess with the files. I’ve just 
gotten them straightened out from 
the last time.” 

“I’ll mention your desires,” Re- 
tief said. “You know, Snop, it seems 
strange to me that you Gloians 
haven’t been able to settle your dif- 
ferences with the Blorts peaceably. 
This skirmishing back and forth has 
been going on for quite a while now, 
with no decisive results.” 

“Hundreds of years, I guess,” 
Snop nodded. “But how can you 
settle your differences with a bunch 
of treacherous, lawless, immoral, 
conscienceless, crooked, planet- steal- 
ing rogues like those Blorts?” Dil 
Snop looked amazed, an effect he 
achieved by rapidly entertwining the 
tendrils around his eyes. 

“They seem harmless enough to 
me,” Retief commented. “Just what 
did they do that earns them that 
description?” 

“What haven’t they done?” Dil 
Snop waved a jointed member. 
“Look at this office — a diplomatic 
mission! Bullet holes all over the 
place, shrapnel scars on the walls — ” 

“The shrapnel scars were made by 
your boys in orange the last time 
they took over,” Retief reminded 
him. 

“Oh. Well, these little accidents 
will happen in the course of foiling

the enemy’s efforts to ravish our 
foster home — and this, mind you, 
sir, after they’ve invaded the hal- 
lowed soil of Plushnik I, swiped the 
entire planet and left us to scrabble 
for ourselves on this lousy world!” 
“Seems like a pretty fair planet to 
me,” Retief said. “And I was un- 
der the impression this was your 
homeland.” 

“Heck, no! This place? Pah! That 
— ” Dil Snop pointed through the 
window at the looming disk of the 
nearby sister planet — “is my be- 
loved ancestral stamping ground.” 
“Ever been there?” 

“I’ve been along on a few in- 
vasions, during summer vacations. 
Just between us,” he lowered his 
voice, “it’s a little too cold and wet 
for my personal taste.” 

4 4 T T ow did the Blorts manage to 
n steal it?” 

“Carelessness on our part,” Snop 
conceded. “Our forces were all over 
^here, administering a drubbing to 
them, and they treacherously slipped 
over behind our backs and entrench- 
ed themselves.” 

“What about the wives and little 
ones?” 

“Oh, an exchange was worked 
out. After all, they’d left their ob- 
noxious brats and shrewish mates 
here on Plushnik II.” 

“What started the feud at first?” 
“Beats me. I guess that’s lost in 
the mists of antiquity or something.” 
The Gloian put down his glass and 
rose. “I’d better be off now, Mr. 
Retief. My reserve unit’s been called 
up, and I’m due at the armory in 
half an hour.” 



“Well, take care of yourself, Dil 
Snop. I’ll be seeing you soon, I ex- 
pect.” 

“I wouldn’t guarantee it. Old Lib 
Clip’s taken personal command, and 
he burns troops like joss sticks.” He 
tipped his beret and went out. A mo- 
ment later, the narrow face of Coun- 
sellor Magnan appeared at the door. 

“Come along, Retief. The Am- 
bassador wants to say a few words 
to the staff; everyone’s to assemble 
in the subcellar in five minutes.” 

“I take it he feels that darkness 
and solitude will be conducive to 
creative thinking.” 

“Don’t disparage the efficacy of 
the Deep-think technique. Why, Tve 
already evolved half a dozen pro- 
posals for dealing with the situation.” 
“Will any of them work?” 

Magnan looked grave. “No. But 
they’ll look quite impressive in my 
personnel file during the hearings.” 
“A telling point, Mr. Magnan. 
Well, save a seat for me in a seclud- 
ed corner. I’ll be along as soon as 
I’ve run down a couple of obscure 
facts.” 

R etief employed the next quarter 
hour in leafing through back 
files of classified dispatch binders. 
As he finished, a Blort attired in 
shapeless blues and a flak helmet 
thrust his organ cluster through the 
door. 

“Hello, Mr. Retief.” he said list- 
lessly. “I’m back.” 

“So you are, Kark,” Retief greet- 
ed the lad. “You’re early. I didn’t 
expect you until after breakfast.” 

“1 got shoved on the first con- 
voy; as soon as we landed I sneaked

off to warn you. Things are going to 
be hot tonight.*’ 

“So I hear, Kark.” A deafening 
explosion just outside bathed the 
room in green light. “Is that a new 
medal you’re wearing?” 

“Yep.” The youth fingered the 
turquoise ribbon anchored to his 
third rib. “I got it for service above 
and beyond the call of nature.” He 
went to the table at the side of. the 
room, opened the drawer. 

“Just what I expected,” he said. 
“That Gloian creep didn’t leave any 
cream for the coffee. I always leave 
a good supply, but does he have the 
same consideration? Not him. Just 
like an Orange.” 

“Kark, what do you know about 
the beginning of the war?” 

“Eh?” The clerk looked up from 
his coffee preparations. “Oh, it has 
something to do with the founding 
fathers. Care for a cup? Black, of 
course.” 

“No, thanks. How does it feel to 
be back on good old Plushnik II 
again?” 

“Good old? Oh, I see what you 
mean. Okay, I guess. Kind of hot 
and dry, though.” The building trem- 
bled to a heavy shock. The snarl of 
heavy armor passing in the street 
shook the pictures on the walls. 

“Well, I’d better be getting to 
work, sir. I think I’ll start with the 
breakage reports. We’re three in- 
vasions behind.” 

“Better skip the paperwork for 
how, Kark. See if you can round 
up a few members of the sweeping 
staff and get some of this glass 
cleaned up. We’re expecting several 
varieties of VIP about daybreak. 



and we wouldn’t want them to get 
the impression we throw wild par- 
ties.” 

“You’re not going out, sir?” Kark 
looked alarmed. “Better not try it; 
there’s a lot of loose metal flying 
around out there, and it’s going to 
get worse!” 

“I thought I’d take a stroll over 
toward the Temple of Higher Learn- 
ing.” 

“But that’s forbidden territory to 
any non-Plushnik.” Kark looked 
worried, as evidenced by the rhyth- 
mic waving of his eyes. 

Retief nodded. “I suppose it’s 
pretty well guarded?” 

“Not during the battle. The Gloian 
have called up everybody but the 
inmates of the amputees’ ward. 
They’re planning another of their 
half-baked counter-invasions. But 
Mr. Retief — if you’re thinking what 
I think you’re thinking, I don’t 
think—” 

“I wouldn’t think of it, Kark.” 
Retief gave the Blortian a cheery 
wave and went out into the deserted 
hall. 

IV 

I n the twilit street, Retief glanced 
up at the immense orb of Plush- 
nik I, barely 4,000 miles distant, a 
celestial relief map occluding half 
the visible sky. A slim crescent of 
the near-by world sparkled in full 
sunlight, llie remainder was a pat- 
tern of lighted cities gleaming in 
the murk of the shadow cast as its 
twin transited between it and the 
primary. 

The route of the Blortian invasion

IF 




fleet was clearly visible as a line of 
tiny, winking fires stretching in a 
loose catenary curve from the ma- 
jor staging areas on the neighbor 
world across the not quite airless 
void. As Retief watched, the giant 
disc sank visibly toward the horizon, 
racing in its two-hour orbit around 
the system’s common center. 

A quarter of a mile distant across 
the park, the high, peach-colored 
dome of the university library push- 
ed up into the evening sky. The dart- 
ing forms of fighter planes were 
silhouetted beyond it, circling each 
other with the agility of combative 
gnats. At the far end of the street, a 
column of gaily caparisoned Gloian 
armored cars raced past, in hot pur- 
suit of a troop of light tanks flying 
the Blortian pennant. The sky to the 
north and west winked and flickered 
to the incessant duelling of Blue and 
Orange artillery. There was a sharp, 
descending whistle as a badly aimed 
shell dropped half a block away, 
sending a gout of pavement chips 
hurtling skyward. Retief waited un- 
til the air was momentarily clear of 
flying fragments to cross the street 
and head across the park. 

The high walls of the Center of 
Learning, inset with convoluted pat- 
terns in dark-colored mosaic tile, 
reared up behind a dense barrier 
of wickedly thomed shark trees. Re- 
tief used a small pocket beamer to 
slice a narrow path through into the 
grounds, where a flat expanse of 
deep green lawn extended a hundred 
yards to the windowless structure. 
Retief crossed it, skirted a neatly 
trimmed rose bed where a stuffed 
dust-owl lay staring up into the night 



with red glass eyes. Above, a ragged 
scar showed in the brickwork of the 
sacrosanct edifice. There were dense 
vines on the wall at that point. 

It was an easy two-minute climb 
to the opening, beyond which shat- 
tered glass cases and a stretch of 
hall were visible. Retief gave a last* 
glance at the searchlight-swept sky^ 
and stepped inside. Dim light glowed 
in the distance. He moved silently 
along the corridor, pushed through 
a door into a vast room filled with 
racks containing the books favored 
by both Gloians and Blorts. 

As he did, a light stabbed out 
and flicked across his chest, fixed 
on the center button of his dark 
green early-evening blazer. 

44T^on’t come any farther,” a 
-L' reedy voice quavered. “I’ve 
got this light right in your eye and 
a bloop gun aimed at where I esti- 
mate your vitals to be.” 

“The effect is blinding,” Retief 
said. “I guess you’ve got me.” Be- 
yond the feeble glow, he made out 
the fragile figure of an aged Gloian 
draped in zebra-striped academic 
robes. 

“I suppose you sneaked in here 
to make off with a load of Plushniki 
historical treasures,” the oldster 
charged. 

“Actually I was just looking for 
a shady spot to load my Brownie,” 
Retief said soothingly. 

“Ah-hah! Photographing cultural 
secrets, eh? That’s two death penal- 
ties you’ve earned so far. Make a 
false move, and it’s three and out.” 
“You’re just too sharp for me. 
Professor,” Retief conceded.

“Well, I do my job.” The ancient 
snapped off the light. “I think we 
can do without this. It gives me a 
splitting flurg-ache. Now, you better 
come along with me to the bomb 
shelter. Those rascally Blorts have 
been dropping shells into the Temple 
grounds, and I wouldn’t want you 
to get hurt before the execution.” 
“Certainly. By the way, since I’m 
to be nipped in the bud for stealing 
information, 1 wonder if it would 
be asking too much to get a few 
answers before 1 go?” 

“Hmmm. Seems only fair. What 
would you like to know?” 

“A number of things,” Retief said. 
“To start with, how did this war be- 
gin in the first place?” 

The curator lowered his voice. 
“You won’t tell anybody?” 

“It doesn’t look as though I’ll have 
the chance.” 

“That’s true. Well, it seems it 
was something like this . .” 

4 C A nd they’ve been at it ever 
since,” the ancient Gloian 
concluded his recital. “Under the cir- 
cumstances, I guess you can see that 
the idea of a cessation of hostilities 
is unthinkable.” 

“This has been very illuminating,” 
Retief agreed. “By the way, during 
the course of your remarks, I hap- 
pened to think of a couple of little 
errands that need attending to. I won- 
der if we couldn’t postpone the exe- 
cution until tomorrow?” 

“Well — it’s a little unusual. But 
with all this shooting going on out- 
side, I don’t imagine we could stage 
a suitable ceremony in any case. I 
suppose I could accept your parole; 



you seem like, an honest chap, for 
a foreigner. But be back by lunch- 
time, remember. I hate these last- 
minute noose adjustments.” His hand 
came up suddenly; there was a sharp 
zopp! and a glowing light bulb across 
the room poofl^d and died. 

“All the same, it’s a good thing 
you asked.” The old curator blew 
across the end of his pistol barrel 
and tucked the weapon away. 

“I’ll be here,” Retief assured the 
elder. “How if you’d just show me 
the closest exit, I’d better be getting 
started.” 

The Gloian tottered along a nar- 
row passage, opened a plank door 
letting onto the side garden. “Nice 
night,” he opined, looking at the 
sky where the glowing vapor trails 
of fighter planes looped across the 
constellations. “You couldn’t ask for 
a better one for — say, what are 
these errands you’ve got to run?” 

“Cultural secrets.” Retief laid a 
finger across his lips and stepped 
out into the night. 

It was a brisk ten-minute walk 
to the Embassy garages, where the 
small official fleet of high-powered 
CDT vehicles was stored. Retief 
selected a fast-moving, one-man 
courier boat; a moment later the lift 
deposited the tiny craft on the roof. 
He checked over the instruments, 
took a minute to tune the tightbeam 
finder set to the personal code of the 
Gloian Chief of State and lifted off. 

V 

R ocketing along at fifteen hundred 
feet, Retief had a superb view 
of the fireworks below. The Blor- 



20 



IF 




tian beachhead north of town had 
been expanded into a wide curve of 
armored units poised ready for the 
dawn assault that was to sweep the 
capital clear. To the west, Gloian 
columns were massing for the coun- 
terstrike. At the point of juncture 
of the proposed assault lines, the 
lights of the Terran Embassy glowed. 

Retief corrected course a degree 
and a half, still climbing rapidly, 
watching the quivering needles of 
the seek-and-find beam. The emerald 
and ruby glow of a set of navigation 
lights appeared a mile ahead, moving 
erratically at an angle to his course. 
He boosted the small flyer to match 
altitudes, swung in on the other 
craft’s tail. Close now, he could dis- 
cern the bright-doped, fabric-covered 
wings, the taut rigging wires, the 
brilliant Orange blazon of the Gloian 
national colors on the fuselage, and 
below them the ornate personal em- 
blem of Marshal Lib Glip. He could 
even make out the goggled features 
of the warrior Premier gleaming 
faintly in the greenish light from the 
instrument faces, his satsuma-toned 
scarf streaming bravely behind him. 

Retief maneuvered until he was 
directly above the unsuspecting craft, 
then peeled off and hurtled past it 
on the left dost enough to rock the 
light airplane violently in the buffet- 
ing slip-stream. He came around in 
a hairpin turn, shot above the bi- 
plane as it banked right, did an 
abrupt left to pass under it, and 
saw a row of stars appear across the 
plastic canopy beside his head as 
the Gloian ace turned inside him, 
catching him with a burst from his 
machine guns. 



Retief put the nose of the flier 
down, dived clear of the stream of 
lead, swung back and up in a tight 
curve, rolled out on the airplane’s 
tail. Lib Glip, no mean pilot, put his 
ship through a series of vertical 
eights, snaprolls, immelmans and 
falling leaves, to no avail. Retief 
held the courier boat glued to his tail 
almost close enough to brush the 
wildly wig-wagging control surfaces. 

After fifteen minutes of frantic 
evasive tactics, the Gloian ship 
settled down to a straight speed run. 
Retief loafed alongside, pacing the 
desperate flyer. When Lib Glip look- 
ed across at him, Retief made a 
downward motion of his hand and 
pointed at the ground. Then he eased 
over, placed himself directly above 
the bright-painted plane and edged 
downward. 

Below, he could see Lib Glip’s 
face, staring upward. He lowered 
the boat another foot. The embat- 
tled Premier angled his plane down- 
ward. Retief stayed with him, forc- 
ing him down until the racing craft 
was racketing along barely above 
the tops of the celery-shaped trees. 
A clearing appeared ahead. Retief 
dropped until his keel almost scraped 
the fuel tank atop Lib Glip’s upper 
wing. The Gloian, accepting the in- 
evitable, throttled back, settled his 
ship into a bumpy landing and rolled 
to a stop just short of a fence. Re- 
tief dropped in and skidded to a 
halt beside him. 

T he enraged Premier was already 
out of his cockpit, waving a 
large clip-fed hand-gun, as Retief 
popped the hatch of the boat.

“What’s the meaning of this?” the 
Gloian yelled. “Who are you! 
How . He broke off. “Hey, aren’t 
you What’s-his-name, from the Terry 
Embassy?” 

“Correct.” Retief nodded. “I con- 
gratulate your Excellency on your 
acute memory.” 

“What’s the idea of this piece of 
unparalleled audacity?” the Gioian 
leader shrilled. “Don’t you know 
there’s a war on? I was in th:; mid- 
dle of leading a victorious Jr as- 
sault on those Blortian I iue-bel- 
lies — ” 

“Really? I had the impression your 
squadrons were several miles to the 
north, tangling with an impressive 
armada of Blortian bombers and 
what seemed to be a pretty active 
fighter cover.” 

“Well, naturally I have to stand 



off at a reasonable distance in or- 
der to get the Big Picture,” Lib Clip * 
explained. “That still doesn’t tell me ^ 
why a Terry diplomat had the un- 
varnished gall to interfere with my 
movements! I’ve got a good mind to ^ 
blast you full of holes and leave the 
explanations to my Chief of Propa- 
ganda!” 

“I wouldn’t,” Retief suggested. 
“This little thing in my hand is a 
tight-beam blaster. Not that there’s 
any need for such implements among 
friendly associates.” 

“Armed diplomacy?” Lib Clip 
choked. “I’ve never heard of such 
a thing!” 

“Oh, I’m off duty,” Retief said. 
“This is just a personal call. There’s 
a little favor I’d like to ask of you.” 

“A . favor? What is it?” 

“I’d like a ride in your airplane.” 





“You mean you forced me to the 
ground just to . to . 

“Right. And there’s not much 
time, so I think we’d better be go- 
ing.” 

“I’ve heard of airplane fanciers, 
but this is fantastic! Still, now that 
you’re here, I may as well point out 
to you she has a sixteen cylinder 
V-head mill, swinging a twenty-four 
lamination sword-wood prop, syn- 
chronized 9mm lead-spitters, twin 
spotlights, low pressure tires, foam 
rubber seats, real instruments — no 
idiot lights — and a ten-coat hand- 
rubbed lacquer job. Sharp, eh? And 
wait till you see the built-in bar.” 
“A magnificent craft, your Excel- 
lency.” Relief admired the machine. 
“I’ll take the rear cockpit and tell 
you which way to steer.” 

“You’ll tell me — ” 



“I have the blaster, remember?” 
Lib Glip grunted and climbed into 
his seat. Relief strapped in behind 
him. The Premier started up, taxied 
to the far end of the field, gunned 
the engine, and lifted off into the 
tracer-streaked sky. 

VI 

Ci'T^hat’s him.” Relief pointed to 
A a lone vehicle perched on a 
hilltop above a lively fire-fight, clear- 
ly visible now against a landscape 
bathed in the bluish light of the 
newly risen crescent of Plushnik I, 
the lower curve of which was at the 
horizon, the upper almost at Zenith. 

“See here, this is dangerous,” Lib 
Glip called over the whine of air 
thrumming through the rigging wires 
as the plane glided down in a wide 




spiral, “That car packs plenty of fire- 
power, and — ” 

He broke off and banked sharply 
as vivid flashes of blue light stutter- 
ed suddenly from below. The brililant 
light of Plushnik I glinted from the 
armored car’s elevated guns as they 
tracked the descending craft. 

“Put a short burst across his bow,” 
Retief said. “But be careful not to 
damage him.” 

“Why, that’s Barfs personal car!” 
the Gloian burst out. “I can’t fire on 
him, or he might — that is, we 
have a sort of gentleman’s agree- 
ment — ” 

“Better do it,” Retief said, watch- 
ing the stream of tracers from below 
arc closer as Barf found the range. 
“Apparently he feels that at this 
range the agreement’s not in effect.” 

Lib Clip angled the nose of the 
craft toward the car and activated 
the twin lead-spitters. A row of pock- 
marks appeared in the turf clpse be- 
side the car as the plane shot low 
over it. 

“That’ll teach him to shoot with- 
out looking,” Lib Clip commented. 

“Circle back and land,” Retief 
called. The Premier grumbled but 
complied. The plane came to a halt 
a hundred feet from the armored 
car, which turned to pin the craft 
down in the beams of its headlights. 
Lib Clip rbse, holding both hands 
overhead, and jumped down. 

‘T hope you realize what you’re 
doing,” he said bitterly. “Forcing me 
to place myself in the hands of this 
barbarian is flagrant interference in 
Plushniki internal affairs! See here, 
if he’s been crooked enough to offer 
you a bribe, I give you my word as 



a statesman tiiat Tm even crookeder. 
I’ll up his offer — ” 

“Now, now, your Excellency, this 
is merely a friendly get-together. 
Let’s go over and relieve the gen- 
eral’s curiosity now, before he de- 
cides to clear his guns again.” 

A s Retief and the Gloian came up, 
a hatch opened at the top of 
the heavy car and the eye-stalk of 
the Blortian emerged cautiously. The 
three eyes looked over the situation; 
then the medal-hung chest of the of- 
ficer appeared. 

“Here, what’s all this shooting?” 
he inquired in an irritated tone. “Is 
that you, Glip? Come out to ar- 
range surrender terms, I suppose. 
Could have gotten yourself hurt — ” 
“Surrender my maternal great- 
aunt Bunny!” the Gloian shrilled. “I 
was abducted by armed force and 
brought here at gun-point!” 

“Eh?” Barf peered at Retief. “I 
thought you’d brought Retief along 
as an impartial witness to the very 
liberal amnesty terms I’m prepared 
to offer.” 

“Gentlemen, if you’ll suspend hos- 
tilities for just a moment or two,” 
Retief put in, “I believe I can ex- 
plain the purpose of this meeting. I 
confess the delivery of invitatiii^ns 
may have been a trifle informal, but 
when you hear the news. I’m sure 
you’ll agree it was well worth the 
effort.” 

“What news?” both combatants 
echoed. 

Retief drew a heavy, fan-shaped 
paper from an inner pocket. “The 
war news,” he said crisply. “I hap- 
pened to be rummaging through 



24 



IF 




some old papers and came across a 
full account of the story behind the 
present conflict. I’m going to give 
it to the press first thing in the 
morning, but I felt you gentlemen 
should get the word first, so that 
you can realign your war aims ac- 
cordingly.” 

“Realign?” Barf said cautiously. 

“Story?” Lib Clip queried. 

“I assume, of course, that you 
gentlemen are aware of the facts of 
history?” Retief paused, paper in 
hand. 

“Why, ah, as a matter of fact — ” 
Barf said. 

“I don’t believe I actually, 
er . .” the Gloian Premier har- 
rumphed. 

“But of course, we Blort don’t 
need to delve into the past to find 
cause for the present crusade for the 
restoration of the national honor,” 
Barf pointed out. 

“Gloy has plenty of up-to-date rea- 
sons for her determination to drive 
the invaders from the fair soil of her 
home planet,” Lib Glip snorted. 

“Of course. But this will inspire 
the troops,” Retief pointed out. “Im- 
agine how morale will zoom, Mr. 
Premier,” he addressed the Gloian, 
“when it becomes known that the 
original Blortians were a group of 
government employees from Old 
Plushnik, en route to the new settle- 
ments here on Plushnik I and II.” 

“Government employees, eh?” 
Barf frowned. “I suppose they were 
high-ranking civil servants, that sort 
of thing?” 

“No,” Retief demurred. “As a 
matter of fact, they were prison 
guards, with a rank of GB 19.” 



“Prison guards? GB 19?” Barf 
growled. “Why, that’s the lowest 
rank in the entire government pay- 
roll!” 

“Certainly there can be no charge 
of snobbery there,” Retief said in 
tones of warm congratulation. 

A choking sound issued from Lib 
Glip’s speaking aperture. “Par- 
don my mirth,” he gasped. “But after 
all the tripe we’ve heard — eek- 
eek — about the glorious past of 
Blort . .*• 

“And that brings us to the 
Gloians,” Retief put in smoothly. 
“They, it appears, were travelling 
on the same vessel at the time of the 
outbreak — or should I say break- 
out?” 

“Same vessel?” 

Retief nodded. “After all, the 
guards had to have something to 
guard.” 

“You mean . .?” 

“That’s right,” Retief said cheer- 
fully. “The Gloians’ founding fathers 
were a consignment of criminals 
sentenced to transportation for life.” 
General Barf uttered a loud 
screech of amusement and slapped 
himself on the thigh. 

“I don’t know why I didn’t guess 
that intuitively!” he chortled. “How 
right you were, Retief, to dig out 
this charming intelligence!” 

“See here!” Lib Glip shrilled. 
“You can’t publish defamatory in- 
formation of that sort! I’ll take it to 
court!” 

“And give the whole galaxy a 
good laugh over the breakfast 
trougb,” Barf agreed. “A capital sug- 
gestion, my dear Glip!”

s^Anyway, I don’t believe it! It’s 
a tissue of lies! A bunch of malarkeyl 
A dirty, lousy falsehood, and a base 
canard!” 

“Look for yourself.” Relief offer- 
ed the documents. Lib Clip fingered 
the heavy parchment, peered at the 
complicated characters. 

“Hit’s printed in Old Plushnik,” he 
grumbled. “I’m afraid I never went 
in for dead languages.” 

“General?” Retief handed over the 
papers. Barf glanced at them and 
handed them back, still chuckling. 
“No, sorry. I’ll have to take your 
word for it — and I do.” 

“Fine, then,” Retief said. “There’s 
just one other little point. You gentle- 
men have been invading and counter- 
invading now for upwards of a thou- 
sand years. Naturally in that length 
of time the records have grown a 
trifle confused. However, I believe 
both sides are in agreement that the 
original home planets have changed 
hands and that the Blortians are oc- 
cupying Gloy territory, while the 
Gloians have taken over the original 
Blort world.” 

Both belligerents nodded. 

‘That’s nearly correct,” Retief 
said, “with just one minor correction. 
It isn’t the planets that have changed 
hands. It’s the identities of the par- 
ticipants in the war.” 

“Eh?” . 

“What did you say?” 

“It’s true, gentlemen,” Retief said 
solemnly. “You and your troops. 
General, are descendants of the 
original Gloians. And your people — ” 
he inclined his head to the Gloian 
Premier — “inherit the mantle of 
Blortship.” 



vn 

4 4T>ut this is ghastly,” General 
Barf groaned. “I’ve devoted 
half a lifetime to instilling a cor- 
rect attitude toward Gloians in my 
chaps. How can I face them now!” 
“Me, a Blort?” Lib Glip shudder- 
ed. “Still,” he said as if to him- 
self, “we were the guards, not the 
prisoners. I sup{X)se on the whole 
we’ll be able to console ourselves 
with the thought that we aren’t re- 
presentatives of the criminal class.” 
“Criminal class!” Barf snorted. 
“By Pud, sir, I’d rather trace my 
descent from an honest victim of 
the venal lackeys of a totalitarian 
regime than to claim kinship with a 
pack of hireling turnkeys!” 

“Lackeys, eh? I suppose that’s 
what a pack of butter-fingered pick- 
pockets would think of a decent 
servant of law and order!” 

“Now, gentlemen. I’m sure these 
trifling differences can be settled 
peaceably,” Retief put in. 

“Ah-hah, so thafs it!” Barf 
crowed. “You’ve dug the family 
skeletons out of the closet in the 
mistaken belief it would force us to 
suspend hostilities!” 

“By no means. General,” Retief 
said blandly. “Naturally, you’ll want 
to exchange, supplies of propaganda 
leaflets and go right on with the 
crusade. But of course you’ll have to 
swap planets, too.” 

“How’s that?” 

“Certainly. The CDT can’t stand 
by and see the entire populations of 
two worlds condenmed to live on, 
in exile on a foreign planet. I’m 
sure I can arrange for a fleet of 



26 



IF 




Corps transports to handle the trans- 
fer of population — ” 

“Just a minute,” Lib Clip cut in. 
“You mean you’re going to repatriate 
all us, er, Blortians to Plushnik I 
and give Plushnik II to those ras- 
cally, ah, Gloians?” 

“Minus the slanted adjectives, a 
very succinct statement of affairs.” 
“Now, just a minute,” Barf put 
in. “You don’t expect me to actually 
settle down on this dust-ball full 
time, do you? With my sinus con- 
dition?” 

“Me live in the midst of that 
swamp?” Lib Clip hooked a thumb 
skyward at the fully risen disk of 
the gibbous planet, where rivers and 
mountains, continents and seas 
gleamed cheerfully, reflecting the 
rays of the distant sun. “Why, my 
asthma would kill me in three weeks! 
That’s why I’ve always stuck to 
lightning raids instead of long, 
drawn-out operations!” 

“Well, gentlemen, the CDT cer- 
tainly doesn’t wish to be instrumen- 
tal in undermining the health of two 
cooperative statesmen.” 

“Ah . how do you mean, co- 
operative?” Barf voiced the question. 

iC^^T'ou know how it is. General,” 
1 Retief said. “When one has 
impatient superiors breathing down 
one’s neck, it’s a little hard to really 
achieve full rapport with even the 
most laudable aspirations of others. 
However, if Ambassador Biteworse 
were in a position to show the in- 
spectors a peaceful planet in the 
morning, it might very well influ- 
ence him to defer the evacuation un- 
til further study of the question.” 



“But . my two-pronged panzer 
thrust,” the general faltered. “The 
crowning achievement of my mili- 
tary career!” 

“My magnificently coordinated 
one-two counterstrike!” Lib Glip 
wailed. “It cost me two weeks’ golf 
to work out those logistics!” 

“I might even go so far’ as to 
hazard a guess,” Retief pressed on, 
“that in the excitement of the an- 
nouncement of the armistice, I might 
even forget to publish my historical 
findings.” 

“Hmmm.” Barf eyed his colleague. 
“It might be a trifle tricky, at that, 
to flog up the correct degree of anti- 
Blort enthusiasm on such short no- 
tice.” 

“Yes, I can foresee a certain 
amount of residual sympathy for 
Gloian institutions lingering on for 
quite some time,” Lib Glip nodded. 

“I’d still have the use of my car, 
of course,” the general mused. “As 
well as my personal submarine, my 
plushed-up transport and my various 
copters, hoppers, unicycles and sedan 
chairs for use on rough terrain.” 

“I suppose it would be my duty 
to keep the armed forces at the peak 
of condition with annual War 
Games,” Lib Glip commented. He 
glanced at the general. “In fact, we 
might even work out some sort of 
scheme for joint maneuvers, just to 
keep the recruits sharpened up.” 

“Not a bad idea, Glip. I might try 
for the single-engine pursuit trophy 
myself.” 

“Ha! Nothing you’ve got can touch 
my little beauty when it comes to 
close-in combat work!” 

“I’m sure we can work out the

details later, gentlemen,*’ Retief said. 
“I must be getting back to the Em- 
bassy now. I hope your formal joint 
announcement will be ready soon.” 
“Well . .” Barf looked at Lib 
Clip. “Under the circumstances ...” 
“I suppose we can work out some- 
thing,” the latter assented glumly. 

“I’ll give you a lift back in my car, 
Retief,” General Barf offered. “Just 
wait till you see how she handles!” 

I n the pink, light of dawn. Am- 
bassador Biteworse and his staff 
waited on the breeze-swept ramp to 
greet the portly officials descending 
from the Corps lighter. 

“Well, Hector,” the senior mem- 
ber of the inspection team comment- 
ed, looking around the immaculate 
environs of the port, “It looks as 
though perhaps some of those rumors 
we heard as to a snag in the dis- 
armament talks were a trifle exag- 
gerated,” 

Biteworse smiled blandly. “A pure- 
ly routine affair.” 

“Actually, I think it’s about time 
we began considering you for a 
more substantive post. Hector.” 
“That was a dirty trick, Retief, 
getting a pardon directly from young 
Lib Clip. I don’t get much excite- 
ment over there in the stacks.” 
“Things will be better from now 
on,” Retief assured the oldster. “I 
think you can expect to see the 
library opened to the public soon.” 
“Oh, boy!” the curator exclaimed. 
“Just what I’ve been urging for 
years! Plenty of snazzy young co- 
eds coming in, eager to butter an old 
fellow up in return for a guaranteed 
crib-sheet! Thanks, lad!” 



“Retief.” Magnan plucked at his 
sleeve. “I’ve heard a number of frag- 
mentary rumors regarding events 
leading up to the truce. I trust your 
absence from the Chancellery for an 
hour or two early in the evening was 
in no way connected with the various 
kidnappings, thefts, trespasses, as- 
saults, blackmailings, breakings and 
enterings and other breaches of diplo- 
matic usage said to have occurred.” 
“Mr. Magnan, what a suggestion!” 
Retief took out a fan-folded paper, 
began tearing it into strips. 

“Sorry, Retief. By the way, isn’t 
that a Old Plushniki manuscript 
you’re destroying?” 

“This? Why, no. It’s an old Chinese 
menu I came across tucked in the 
Classified Dispatch binder.” He 
dropped the scraps in a refuse bin. 

“Oh. Well, why don’t you join me 
in a quick bite before this morning’s 
briefing for the inspectors? The Am- 
bassador plans to give them his stan- 
dard five-hour introductory chat, fol- 
lowed by a quick run-through of the 
voucher files — ” 

“No, thanks. I have an appoint- 
ment with Lib Clip to check out in 
one of his new model pursuit ships.” 
“Well, I suppose you have to 
humor him, inasmuch as he’s Pre- 
mier.” Magnan cocked an eye at Re- 
tief. “I confess I don’t understand 
how it is you get on such familiar 
terms with these bigwigs, restricted 
as your official duties are to prepara- 
tion of reports in quintiplicate.” 

“I think it’s merely a sort of in- 
formal manner I adopt in meeting 
them,” Retief said. He waved and 
headed across the runway to where 
the little ship waited. END

Puppeteers never made bod bargains. 
If they offered a high price for a 
job, a wise man would turn it down! 



I 

I couldn’t decide whether to call it 
a painting, a relief mural, a sculp- 
ture or a hash; but it was the prize 
exhibit in the Art Section of the 
Institute of Knowledge on Jinx. The 
Kdatlyno must have strange eyes, I 
thou^t. My own were watering. 
The longer I looked at “FTL- 
SPACE”, the more blurred it got. 

I’d tentatively decided that it was 
supposed to look blurred when a set 
of toothy jaws clamped gently on 



my arm. I jumped a foot in the air. 
A soft, thrilling contralto voice said, 
“Beowulf Shaeffer, you are a spend- 
thrift.” 

That voice would have made a 
singer’s fortune. And I thought I 
recognized it — but it couldn’t be; 
that one was on We Made It, light- 
years distant. I turned. 

The puppeteer had released my 
arm. It went on: “And what do you 
think of Hrodenu?” 

“He’s ruining my eyes.” 
“Naturally. The Kdatlyno are 



29 




blind to all but radar. ‘FTLSPACE’ 
is meant not to be seen but to be 
toudied. Run your tongue over it.” 
“My tong:ue? No, thanks.” I tried 
running my hand over it. If you want 
to know what it felt like, hop a ship 
for Jinx; the thing’s still there. I 
flatly refuse to describe the sensation. 

The puppeteer cocked its heads 
dubiously. “I’m sure your tongue is 
more sensitive. No guards are near.” 
“Forget it. You know, you sound 
just like the regional president of 
General Products on We Made It.” 
“It was he who sent me your dos- 
sier, Beowulf Shaeffer. No doubt 
we had the same English teacher. I 
am the regional president on Jinx, 
as you no doubt recognized from 
my mane.” 

W ell, not quite. A puppeteer is 
best described as a three leg- 
ged centaur with two flat, brainless 
heads mounted on long, sinuous 
necks. The mouths also function as 
hands, and very well, too. The mane, 
which runs from the tail forward to 
become an auburn mop over the 
brain case between the necks, is sup- 
posed to show caste once you learn 
to discount variations of mere style. 
To do that you have to be a pup- 
peteer. Instead of admitting my 
ignorance, I asked, “Did that dos- 
sier say I was a spendthrift?” 

“You have spent more than a 
million stars in the past four years.” 
“And loved it.” 

“Yes. You will shortly be in debt 
again. Have you thougjit of doing 
more writing? I admired your article 
on the neutron star BVS-1. ‘The 
pointy bottom of a gravity well’ . 



‘blue starlight fell on me like intangi- 
ble sleet’ . lovdy.” 

“Thanks. It paid well, too. But 
I’m mainly a spaceship pilot.” 

“It is fortunate, our meeting here. 
I had thought of having you found. 
Do you wish a job?” 

That was a loaded question. The 
last and only time I took a job from 
a puppeteer, the puppeteer black- 
mailed me into it, knowing it would 
probably kill me. It almost did. I 
didn’t hold that against the regional 
president of We Made It. In fact, I 
blackmailed him back when he let 
it slip that the puppeteer home planet 
has no moon. The puppeteers, con- 
stitutional cowards all, go to great 
lengths to keep the galaxy-at-largc 
from finding that world. But to let 
them have another crack at me — ? 
“I’ll give you a conditional Maybe. 
Do you have the idea I’m a pro- 
fessional suicide pilot?” 

“Not at all. If I show details, do 
you agree that the information shall 
be confidential?” 

“I do,” I said formally, knowing 
it would commit me. A verbal con- 
tract is as binding as the tape it’s 
recorded on. 

“Good. Come.” He pranced 
toward a transfer booth. 

T he transfer booth let us out 
somewhere in Jinx’s vacuum 
regions. It was night. High in the 
sky, Sirius B was a painfully bright 
pinpoint casting vivid blue moonlight 
on a ragged lunar landscape. I look- 
ed up and didn’t see Binary, Jinx’s 
bloated orange companion planet, 
so we must have been in the Far- 
side End.

IF 




But there was something 'hanging 
over us. 

A #4 General Products hull is a 
transparent sphere a (thousand-odd 
feet in diameter. No bigger ship has 
been built anywhere in the known 
galaxy. It takes a government to 
buy one, and they are used for 
colonization projects only. But this 
one could never have been so used. 
It was all machinery. Our transfer 
booth stood between two of the land- 
ing legs, so that the swelling flank 
of the ship looked down on us as an 
owl looks down at a mouse. An ac- 
cess tube ran through vacuum from 
the booth to the airlock. 

I said, “Does General Products 
build complete spacecraft nowa- 
days?” 

“We are thinking of branching 
out. But there are problems.” 

From the viewpoint of the pup- 
peteer-owned company, it must have 
seemed high time. General Products 
makes the hulls for ninety-five per 
cent of all ships in space, mainly 
because nobody else knows how to 
build an indestructible hull. But 
they’d made a bad start with this 
ship. The only room I could see for 
crew, cargo or passengers was a few 
cubic yards of empty space right at 
the bottom, just above the airlock. 
And it seemed to be just big enough 
for a pilot. 

“You’d have a hard time selling 
that,” I said. 

“True. Do you notice anything 
else?” 

“Well . .” The hardware which 
filled the transparent hull was very 
tightly packed. The effect was as if 
a race of ten-mile-tall giants had 



striven to achieve miniaturization. I 
saw no sign of access tubes; hence 
there could be no in-spaoe repairs. 
Four reaction motors poked their 
appropriately huge nostrils through 
the hull, angled outward from the 
bottom. No small attitude jets; hence, 
oversized gyros inside. Otherwise . 
“Most of it looks like hyperdrive 
motors. But that’s silly. Unless you’ve 
thought of a good reason for moving 
moons around?” 

“At one time you were a com- 
mercial pilot for Nakamura Lines. 
How long was the run from Jinx 
to We made It?” 

“Twelve days if nothing broke 
down.” Just long enough to get to 
know the prettiest passenger aboard, 
while the autopilot did everything 
for me but wear my uniform. 

“Sirius to Procyon is a distance 
of four light-years. Our ship would 
be able to make the trip in five min- 
utes.” 

“You’ve lost your mind.” 

“No.” 

But — that was almost a light- 
year per minute! I couldn’t visu- 
alize it. Then suddenly I did visu- 
alize it, and my mouth fell open, 
for what I saw was the galaxy open- 
ing before me. We know so little 
beyond our own small neighborhood 
of the galaxy. But with a ship like 
that — ! 

“That’s goddam fast.” 

“As you say. But the equipment 
is bulky, as you note. It cost seven 
billion stars to build that ship, dis- 
counting centuries of research, but 
it will only move one man. As is, the 
ship is a failure. Shall we go inside 
and take a look?” 



AT THE CORE

n 

T he lifesystem was two circular 
rooms, one above the other, 
with a small airlock to one side. The 
lower room was the control room, 
with banks of switches and dials and 
blinking lights dominated by a huge 
si^erical mass pointer. The upper 
room was bare walls, transparent, 
through which I could see air- and 
food-producing equipment. 

“This will be the relaxroom,” said 
the puppeteer. “We decided to let 
the pilot decorate it himself.” 

“Why me?” 

“Let me further explain the prob- 
lem.” The puppeteer began to pace 
the floor. I hunkered down against 
the wall and watched. Watching a 
puppeteer move is a pleasure. Even 
in Jinx’s gravity the deerlike body 
seemed weightless, the tiny hooves 
tapping the floor at random. “The 
human sphere of colonization is 
some thirty light-years across, is it 
not?” 

“Maximum. It’s not exactly a 
sphere — ” 

‘The puppeteer region is much 
smaller. The Kdatlyno sphere is half 
the size of yours, and the kzinti is 
fractionally larger. These are the 
important space-traveling species. We 
must discount the Outsiders since 
they do not use ships. Some spheres 
coincide, naturally. Travel from one 
sphere to another is nearly nil ex- 
cept for ourselves, since our sphere 
of influence extends to all who buy 
our hulls. But add all these regions, 
and you have a region sixty light- 
years across. This ship could cross 
it in seventy-five minutes. Allow six 



hours for takeoff and six for landing, 
assuming no traffic snarls near the 
world of destination, and we have a 
ship which can go anywhere in thir- 
teen hours but nowhere in less than 
twelve, carrying one pilot and no 
cargo, costing seven billion stars.” 
“How about exploration?” 

“We puppeteers have no taste for 
abstract knowledge. And how should 
we explore?” Meaning that whatever 
race flew the ship would gain the 
advantages thereby. A puppeteer 
wouldn’t risk his necks by flying it 
himself. “What we need is a great 
deal of money and a gathering of in- 
telligences, to design something 
which may go slower but must be 
' less bulky. General Products does 
not wish to spend so much on some- 
thing that may fail. We will require 
the best minds of each sentient 
species and the richest investors. 
Beowulf Shaeffer, we need to attract 
attention.” 

“A publicity stunt?” 

“Yes. We wish to send a pilot to 
the center of the galaxy and back.” 
“Ye . gods! Will it go that fast?” 
“It would require some twenty-five 
days to reach the center and an equal 
time to return. You can see the rea- 
soning behind — ” 

“It’s perfect. You don’t need to 
spell it out. Why me?” 

“We wish you to make the trip 
and then write of it. I have a list of 
pilots who write. Those I have ap- 
proached have been reluctant. They 
say that writing on the ground is 
safer than testing unknown ships. I 
follow their reasoning.” 

“Me too.” 

“Will you go?” 



32 



IF 




“What am I offered?” 

“One hundred thousand stars for 
the trip. Fifty thousand to write the 
story, in addition to what you sell it 
for.” 

“Sold.” 

F rom then on, my only worry was 
that my new boss would find 
out that someone had ghostwritten 
that neutron star article. 

Oh, I wondered at first why Gen- 
eral Products was willing to trust me. 
The first time I worked for them I 
tried to steal their ship, for reasons 
which seemed good at the time. But 
the ship I now called Long Shot 
really wasn’t worth stealing. Any 
potential buyer would know it was 
hot; and what good would it be to 
him? Long Shot could have explored 
a globular cluster; but her only othei; 
use was publicity. 

Sending her to the Core was a 
masterpiece of promotion. 

Look: it was twelve days from 
We Made It to Jinx by conventional 
craft, and twelve hours by Long 
Shot, What’s the difference? You 
spent twelve years saving for the 
trip. But the Core! Ignoring refuel- 
ing and reproyisioning problems, my 
•Id ship could have reached the 
galaxy’s core in three hundred years. 
No known species had ever seen the 
Core! It hid behind layer on layer of 
tenuous gas and dust clouds. You 
can find libraries of hterature on 
those central stars, but they all con- 
sist of generalities and educated 
guesses based on observation of other 
galaxies, like Andromeda. 

Three centuries dropped to less 
than a month! There’s something 



anyone can grasp. And with pictures! 

The lifesystem was finished in a 
couple of weeks. I had them leave 
the control room walls transparent 
and paint the relaxroom solid blue, 
no windows. When they finished I 
had entertainment tapes and every- 
thing it takes to keep a man sane 
for seven weeks in a room the size 
of a large closet. 

On the last day the puppeteer 
and I spoke the final version of my 
contract. I had four months to reach 
the galaxy’s center and return. The 
outside cameras would run constant- 
ly; I was not to interfere with them. 
If the ship suffered a mechanical 
failure I could return before reach- 
ing the center, otherwise, no. There 
were penalties. I took a copy of the 
tape to leave with a lawyer. 

“There is a thing you should 
know,” the puppeteer said afterward. 
“The direction of thhist opposes the 
direction of hyperdrive.” 

“I don’t get it.” 

The puppeteer groped for words. 
“If you turned on the reaction 
motors and the hyperdrive together, 
the flames would precede your ship 
through hyperspace.” 

I got the picture then. Backward 
into the unknown. With the control 
room at the ship’s bottom, it made 
sense. To a puppeteer, it made sense. 

Ill 

nd I was off. 

I wsnt up under two standard 
gees because I like my comfort. 
For twelve hours I used only the re- 
action motors. It wouldn’t do to be 
too deep in a gravity well when I 




AT THE CORE 



33 




used a hyperdrive, especially an ex- 
perimental one. Pilots who do that 
never leave hyperspace. The relax- 
room kept me entertained until the 
hell rang. I slipped down to the con- 
trol room, netted myself down 
againss free fall, turned off the mo- 
tors, rubbed my hands briskly to- 
gether, and turned on the hyperdrive. 

It wasn’t quite like I’d expected. 

I couldn’t see out, of course. When 
the hyperdrive goes on it’s like your 
blind spot expanding to take in all 
the windows. It’s not just that you 
don’t see anything; you forget that 
there’s anything to see. If there’s a 
window between the kitchen con- 
trol bank and your print of Dali’s 
“Spain”, your eye and mind will 
put the picture right next to the 
kitchen bank, obliterating the space 
between. It takes getting used to, in 
fact it has driven people insane, but 
that wasn’t what bothered me. I’ve 
spent thousands of man-hours in hy- 
perspace. I kept my eye on the mass 
pointer. 

The mass pointer is a big trans- 
parent sphere with a number of blue 
lines radiating from the center. The 
direction of the line is the direc- 
tion of a star; its length shows the 
star’s mass. We wouldn’t need pilots 
if the mass pointer could have been 
hooked into an autopilot, but it 
can’t. Dependable as it is, accurate 
as it is, the mass pointer is a psionic 
device. It needs a mind to work. I’d 
been using mass pointers for so long 
that those lines were like real stars. 

A star came toward me, and I 
dodged around it. I thought that an- 
other line that didn’t point quite 
straight ahead was long enough to 



show dangerous mass, so I dodged. 
That put la blue dwarf right in front 
of me. I shifted fast and looked for 
a throttle. I wanted to slow down. 

Repeat, I wanted to slow down. 

Of course there was no throttle. 
Part of the puppeteer research pro- 
ject would be designing a throttle. A 
long, fuzzy line reached for me: a 
protosun .... 

Put it this way: imagine one of 
Earth’s freeways. You must have 
seen pictures of them from space, a 
tangle of twisting concrete ribbons, 
empty and abandoned but never torn 
down. Some lie broken; others are 
covered with houses. People use the 
later rubberized ones for horseback 
riding. Imagine the way one of these 
must have looked about six o’clock 
on a week night in, say, nineteen 
■seventy. Groundcars from end to 
end. 

Now, let’s take all these cars and 
remove the brakes. Further, let’s put 
governors on the accelerators, so 
that the maximum speeds are be- 
tween sixty and seventy miles per 
hour, not all the same. Let something 
go wrong with all the governors at 
once, so that the maximum speed 
also becomes the minimum. You’ll 
begin to see signs of panic .... 

Ready? Okay. Get a radar installed 
in your car, paint your windshield 
and windows jet black, and get out 
on that freeway. 

It was like that. 

I t didn’t seem so bad at first. The 
stars kept coming at me, and I 
kept dodging, and after awhile it 
settled down to a kind of routine. 
From experience I could tell at a 



34 



IF 





■;v. 



glance whether a star was heavy 
enough and close enough to wreck 
me. But in Nakamura Lines I’d only 
had to take that glance every six 
hours or so. Here I didn’t dare look 
away. As I grew tired the near- 
misses came closer and closer. After 
three hours of it I had to drop out. 

The stars had a subtly unfamiliar 
look. With a sudden jar I realized 
that I was entirely out of known 
space. Sirius, Antares — I’d never 
recognize them from here; I wasn’t 
even sure they were visible. I shook 
it off and called home. 

“Long Shot calling General Pro- 
ducts, Long Shot calling — ” 
“Beowulf Shaeffer?” 

“Have I ever told you what a 
lovely, sexy voice you have?” 

“No. Is everything going well?” 
“I’m afraid not. In fact, I’m not 
going to make it.” 

A pause. “Why not?” 

“I can’t keep dodging these stars 
forever. One of them’s going to get 
me if I keep on much longer. The 
ship’s just too goddam fast.” 

“Yes. We must design a slower 
ship.” 

“I hate to give up that good pay, 
but my eyes feel like peeled onions. 
I ache all over. I’m turning back.” 
“Shall I play your contract for 
you?” 

“No. Why?” 

“Your only legal reason for re- 
turning is a mechanical failure. 
Otherwise you forfeit twice your pay. 
Jinx has recently adopted the debtor’s 
prison.” 

I said, “Mechanical failure?” 
There was a tool box somewhere in 
the ship, with a hammer in it 



“I did not mention it before, since 
it did not seem polite, but two of 
the cameras are in the lifesystem. 
We had thought to use films of you 
for purposes of publicity, but — ” 

“I see. Tell me one thing, just one 
thing. When the regional president 
of We Made It sent you my name, 
did he mention that I’d discovered 
your planet has no moon?” 

“Yes, he did mention that matter. 
You accepted one million stars for 
your silence. He naturally has a re- 
cording of the bargain.” 

“I see.” So that’s why they’d pick- 
ed Beowulf Shaeffer, well known 
author. “The trip’ll take longer than 
I thought.” 

“You must pay a penalty for every 
extra day over four months. Two 
thousand stars per day late.” 

“Your voice has acquired an un- 
pleasant grating sound. Good-by.” 

I went on in. Every hour I shifted 
to normal space for a ten-minute 
coffee break. I dropped out for 
meals, and I dropped out for sleep. 
Twelve hours per ship’s day I spent 
traveling, and twelve trying to re- 
cover. It was a losing battle. 

By the end of day two I knew I 
wasn’t going to make the four month 
limit. I might do it in six months, 
forfeiting one hundred and twenty 
thousand stars, leaving me almost 
where I started. Serve me right for 
trusting a puppeteer! 

Stars were all around me, shining 
through the floor and between the 
banked instruments. I sucked coffee, 
trying not Xo think. The milky way 
shone ghostly pale between my feet. 
The stars were thick now; they’d get 



36 



IF 




thicker as I approached the Core, 
until finally one got me. 

An idea! And about time, too. 
The golden voice answered imme- 
diately. “Beowulf Shaeffer?” 

“There’s nobody else here, honey. 
Look, I’ve thought of something. 
Would you send — ” 

“Is one of your instruments mal- 
functioning, Beowulf Shaeffer?” 
“No, they all work fine, as far as 
they go. Look — ” 

“Then what could you possibly 
have to say that would require my 
attention?” 

“Honey, now is the time to de- 
cide. Do you want revenge, or do you 
want your ship back?” 

A small silence. Then, “You may 
speak.” 

“I can reach the Core must faster 
if I first get into one of the spaces 
between the arms. Do we know 
enough about the galaxy to know 
where our arm ends?” 

“I will send to the Institute of 
Knowledge to find out.” 

“Good.” 

Four hours later I was dragged 
from a deathlike sleep by the ring- 
ing of the hyperphone. It was not 
the president, but some flunky. I 
remembered calling the puppeteer 
Honey last night, tricked by my own 
exhaustion and that seductive voice, 
and wondered if I’d hurt his pup- 
peteer feelings. “He” might be male; 
a puppeteer’s sex is one of his little 
secrets. The flunky gave me a bear- 
ing and distance for the nearest gap 
between stars. 

It took me another day to get 
there. When the stars began to thin 
out I could hardly believe it. I turned 



off the hyperdrive, and it was true. 
The stars were tens and hundreds 
of light-years apart. I could see part 
of the Core peeking in a bright rim 
above the dim flat cloud of mixed 
dust and stars. 

IV 

F rom then on it was better. I was 
safe if I glanced at the mass 
pointer every ten minutes or so. I 
could forget the rest breaks, eat 
meals and do isometrics while watch- 
ing the pointers. For eight hours a 
day I slept, but during the other six- 
teen I moved. The gap swept toward 
the Core in a narrowing curve, and 
I followed it. 

As a voyage of exploration the 
trip would have been a fiasco. I saw 
nothing; I stayed well away from 
anything worth seeing. Stars and 
dust, anomalous whispy clusters shin- 
ing in the dark of the gap, invisible 
indications that might have been 
stars — my cameras picked them up 
from a nice, safe distance, showing 
tiny blobs of light. In three weeks I 
moved seventeen thousand light- 
years toward the Core. 

The end of those three weeks was 
the end of the gap. Before me was 
an uninteresting wash of stars backed 
by a wall of opaque dust clouds. I 
still had thirteen thousand light- 
years to go before I reached the 
center of the galaxy. 

I took some pictures and moved 
in. 

Ten minute breaks, mealtimes that 
grew longer and longer for the rest 
they gave, sleep periods that left my 
eyes red and burning. The stars were 



AT THE CORE 



37 




thick, and the dust was thicker, so 
that the mass pointer showed a blur 
of blue broken by sharp blue lines. 
The lines began to get less sharp. I 
took breaks every half hour .... 
Three days of that. 

It was getting near lunchtime on 
the fourth day. I sat watching the 
mass pointer, noting the fluctuations 
in the blue blur which showed the 
changing density of the dust around 
me. Suddenly it faded out complete- 
ly. Great! Wouldn’t it be nice if the 
mass pointer went out on me? But 
the sharp starlines were still there, 
ten or twenty of them pointing in 
all directions. I went back to steer- 
ing. The clock chimed to indicate a 
rest period. I sighed happily and 
dropped into normal space. 

The clock showed I had half an 
hour to wait for lunch. I thought 
about eating anyway, decided against 
it. The routine was all that kept me 
going. I wondered what the sky look- 
ed like, reflexively looked up so I 
wouldn’t have to look down at the 
transparent floor. That big an ex- 
panse of hyperspace is hard even on 
trained eyes. I remembered I wasn’t 
in hyperspace and looked down. 

For a time I just stared. Then, 
without taking my eyes off the floor, 
I reached for the hyperphone. 
“Beowulf Shaeffer?” 

“No, this . is Albert Einstein. I 
stowed away when the Long Shot 
took off, and I’ve decided to turn 
myself in for the reward.” 

“Giving misinformation is an im- 
plicit violation of contract. Why 
have you called?” 

“I can see the Core.” 

“That is not a reason to call. 



It was implicit in your contract that 
you would see the Core.” 

“Dammit, don’t you care? Don’t 
you want to know what it looks like?” 
“If you wish to describe it now, 
as a precaution against accident, I 
will switch you to a dictaphone. 
However, if your mission is not total- 
ly successful, we cannot use your 
recording.” 

I was thinking up a really searing 
answer when I heard ‘the click. 
Great, my boss had hooked me into 
a dictaphone. I said one short sen- 
tence and hung up. 

The Core. 

Gone were the obscuring masses 
of dust and gas. A billion years ago 
they must have been swept up for 
fuel by the hungry, crowded stars. 
The Core lay before me like a great 
jeweled sphere. I’d expected it to 
be a gradual thing, a thick mass of 
stars thinning out into the arms. 
There was nothing gradual about it. 
A clear ball of multicolored light 
five or six thousand light-years 
across nestled in the heart of the 
galaxy, sharply bounded by the last 
of the dust clouds. I was ten thou- 
sand four hundred light-years from 
the center. 

The red stars were the biggest and 
brightest. I could actually pick some 
of them out as individuals. The rest 
was a finger painting in fluorescent 
green and blue. But those red stars 
. they would have sent Aldebaran 
back to kindergarten. 

It was all so bright. I needed the 
telescope to see black between the 
stars .... 

I’ll show you how bright it was. 



38 



IF 




Is it night where you are? Step 
outside and look at the stars. What 
color are they? Antares may show 
red, if you’re near enough; in the 
System, so will Mars. Sirius may 
show bluish. But all the rest are white 
pinpoints. Why? Because it’s dark. 
Your day vision is in color, but at 
night you see black-and-white, like a 
dog. 

The Core suns were bright enough 
for color vision. 

I’d pick a planet here! Not in the 
Core itself, but right out here, with 
the Core on one side and on the 
other, the dimly starred dust clouds 
forming their strange convoluted 
curtain. Man, what a view! Imagine 
that flaming jeweled sphere rising 
in the east, hundreds of times as big 
as Binary shows on Jinx, but with- 
out the constant feeling Binary gives 
you, the fear that the orange world 
will fall on you; for the vast, twink- 
ling Core is only starlight, lovely and 
harmless. I’d pick my world now 
and stake a claim. When the pup- 
peteers got their drive fixed up, I’d 
have the finest piece of real estate 
in the known universe! If I could 
only find a habitable planet. 

If only I could find it twice. 

Hell, i’d be lucky to find my way 
home from here. I shifted into hyper- 
space and went back to work. 

V 

A n hour and fifty minutes, one 
lunch break and two rest 
breaks, and fifty light-years later, I 
noticed something peculiar in the 
Core. 

It was even clearer then, if not 



much bigger; I’d passed through the 
almost transparent wisps of the last 
dust cloud. Not too near the center 
of the sphere was a patch of white, 
bright enough to make the green and 
blue and red look dull around it. I 
looked for it again at the next break, 
and it was a little brighter. It was 

brighter again at the next break 

“Beowulf ShaefferV” 

“Yah. I — ” 

“Why did you use the dictaphone 
to call me a cowardly, two-headed, 
monster?” 

“You were off the line. I had 
to use the dictaphone.” 

“That is sensible. Yes. We pup- 
peteers have never understood your 
attitude toward a natural caution.” 
My boss was peeved, though you 
couldn’t tell from his voice. 

“I’ll go into that if you like, but 
it’s not why I called.” 

“Explain, please.” 

“I’m all for caution. Discretion 
is the better part of valor, and like 
that. You can even be good business- 
men, because it’s easier to survive 
with lots of money. But you’re so 
damn concerned with various kinds 
of survival that you aren’t even in- 
terested in something that isn’t a 
threat. Nobody but a puppeteer 
would have turned down my offer to 
describe the Core.” 

“You forget the kzinti.” 

“Oh, the kzinti.” Who expects ra- 
tional behavior from kzinti? You 
whip them when they attack, you 
reluctantly decide not to exterminate 
them, you wait till they build up 
their strength, and when they attack 
you whip ’em again. Meanwhile you 
sell them food-stuffs and buy their 



AT THE CORE 



39 




metals and employ them where you 
need good games theorists. It’s not 
as if they were a real threat. They’ll 
always attack before they’re ready. 

Ci'T^he kzinti are carnivores. 

A Where we are interested in 
survival, carnivores are interested 
in meat alone. They conquer because 
subject peoples can supply them with 
food. Tliey cannot do menial work. 
Animal husbandry is alien to them. 
They must have slaves or be bar- 
barians roaming the forests for meat. 
Why should they be interested in 
what you call abstract knowledge? 
Why should any thinking being, if 
the knowledge has no chance of 
showing a profit? In practice, your 
description of the Core would attract 
only an omnivore.” 

“You’d make a good case, if it 
were not for the fact that most sen- 
tient races are omnivores.” 

“We have thought long and hard 
on that.” 

Ye cats. I was going to have to 
think long and hard on that, 

“Why did you call. Beowulf Shaef- 
fer?” 

Oh, yeah. “Look I know you don’t 
want to know what the Core looks 
like, hut I see something that might 
represent personal danger. You have 
access to information I don’t. May 
I proceed?” 

“Yx>u may.” 

Hah! I was learning to think like 
a puppeteer. Was that good? I told 
my boss about the blazing, strange- 
ly shaped white patch in the Core. 
“When I turned the telescope on it, 
it nearly blinded me. Grade two sun- 
glasses don’t give any details at all. 



It’s just a shapeless white patch, but 
so bright that the stars in front look 
like black dots with colored rims. 
I’d like to know what’s causing it.” 
“It sounds very unusual.” Pause. 
“Is the white color uniform? Is the 
brightness uniform?” 

“Just a sec.” I used the scope 
again. “The color is, but the bright- 
ness isn’t. I see dimmer areas inside 
the patch. I think the center is fading 
out.” 

“Use the telescope to find a nova 
star. There ought to be several in 
such a large mass of stars.” 

I tried it. Presently I found some- 
thing: a blazing disk of a peculiar 
blue-white color with a dimmer, 
somewhat smaller red disc half in 
front of it. That had to be a nova. 
In the core of Andromeda galaxy, 
and in what I’d seen of our own 
Core, the red stars were the biggest 
and brightest. 

“I’ve found one.” 

“Comment.” 

A moment more and I saw what 
he meant. “It’s the same color as 
the patch. Something like the same 
brightness, too. But what could make 
a patch of supernovas go off all at 
once?” 

“You have studied the Core. The 
stars of the Core are an average of 
half a light-year apart. They are 
even closer near the center, and no 
dust clouds dim their brightness. 
When stars are that close they shed 
enough light on each other to materi- 
ally increase each other’s tempera- 
ture. Stars burn faster and age faster 
in the Core.” 

“I see that.” 



40 



IF 




“Since the Core stars age faster, a 
much greater portion are near the 
supernova stage than in the arms. 
Also, all are hotter considering their 
respective ages. If a star were a few 
millenia from the supernova stage, 
and a supernova exploded half a 
light-year away, estimate the prob- 
abilities.” 

4 4''X^hey might both blow. Then 
A the two could set off a third, 
and the three might lake a couple 
more . .” 

“Yes. Since a supernova lasts on 
the order of one human standard 
year, the chain reaction would soon 
die out. Your patch of light must 
have occurred in this way.” 

“That’s a relief. Knowing what did 
it, I mean. I’ll take pictures going 
in.” 

“As you say.” Click. 

The patch kept expanding as I 
went in, still with no more shape 
than a veil nebula, getting brighter 
and bigger. It hardly seemed fair, 
what I was doing. The light which 
the patch novas had taken fifty years 
to put out, I covered in an hour, 
moving down the beam at a speed 
which made the universe itself seem 
unreal. At the fourth rest period I 
dropped out of hyperspace, looked 
down through the floor while the 
cameras took their pictures, glanced 
away from the patch for a moment, 
and found myself blinded by tan- 
gerine afterimages. I had to put on 
a pair of grade one sunglasses, out 
of the packet of twenty which every 
pilot carries for working near suns 
during takeoff and landing. 

It made me shiver, to think that 



the patch was still nearly ten thou- 
sand light-years away. Already the 
radiation must have killed all life 
in the Core, if there ever had been 
life there. 

My instruments on the hull show- 
ed radiation like a solar flare. 

At the next stop I needed grade 
two sunglasses. Somewhat later, 
grade three. Then four. The patch 
became a great bright amoeba reach- 
ing twisting tentacles of fusion fire 
deep into the vitals of the Core. In 
hyper space the sky was jammed 
bumper to bumper, so to speak; but 
I never thought of stopping. As the 
Core came closer the Patch grew 
like something alive, something need- 
ing ever more food. I think I knew, 
even then. 

Night came. The control room 
was a blaze of light. I slept in the 
relaxroom, to the tune of the labor- 
ing temperature control. Morning, 
and I was off again. The radiation 
meter snarled its death song, louder 
during each rest break. If I’d been 
planning to go outside I would have 
dropped that plan. Radiation couldn’t 
get through a General Products hull. 
Nothing else does, either, except vis- 
ible light. 

I spent a bad half hour trying to 
remember 'Whether one of the pup- 
peteers’ customers saw X rays. I was 
afraid to call up and ask. 

The mass pointer began to show 
a faint blue blur. Gases thrown out- 
ward from the patch. I had to keep 
changing sunglasses . 

Sometime during the morning of 
the next day, I stopped. 

There really was no point in go- 
ing further.

“I would like to deliver a lecture

“Surely it can wait until your re-

“The galaxy is exploding.” 

There was a strange noise. Then: 
“Repeat, please.” 

“Have I got your attention?” 
“Yes.” 

“Good. I think I know the reason

riosity must be a survival trait.” 
“Must we discuss this? Very well. 
You may well be right. Others have* 
made the same suggestion, including 
puppeteers. But how has our species 
survived at all?” 

“You must have some substitute 
for curiosity. Increased intelligence, 
maybe. You’ve been around long 
enough to develop it. Our hands 
can’t compare with your mouths for 
tool building. If a watchmaker had 
taste and smell in his hands, he still 
wouldn’t have the strength of your 
jaws or the delicacy of those knobs 
around your lips. When I want to 
know how old a sentient race is, I 
watch what he uses for hands and 
feet.” 

“Yes. Human feet are still adapt- 
ing to their task of keeping you 
erect. You proppose, then, that our 
intelligence has grown sufficiently 
to insure our survival without de- 
pending on your hit-or-miss method 
of learning everything you can for 
the sheer pleasure of learning.” 



“Not quite. Our method is better. 
If you hadn’t sent me to the Core 
for publicity you’d never have known 
about this.” 

“You say the galaxy is exploding.” 
“Rather, it finished exploding 
some nine thousand years ago. I’m 
wearing grade twenty sunglasses, and 
it’s still too bright. A third of the 
Core is gone already. The patch is 
spreading at nearly the speed of 
light. I don’t see that anything can 
stop it until it hits the* gas clouds 
beyond the Core.” 

There was no comment. I went 
on. “A lot of the inside of the patch 
has gone out, but all of the surface 
is new novas. And remember, the 
light I’m seeing is nine thousand 
years old. Now, I’m going to read 
you a few instruments. Radiation, 
two hundred and ten. Cabin tempera-

ture normal, but you can hear the 
whine of the temperature control. 
The mass indicator shows nothing 
but a blur ahead. I’m turning back.” 

“Radiation two hundred and ten? 
How far are you from the edge of 
the Core?” 

“About four thousand light-years, 
I think. I can see plumes of incan- 
descent gas starting to form in the 
near side of the patch, moving toward 
galactic north and south. It reminds 
me of something. Aren’t there pic- 
tures of exploding galaxies in the 
Institute?” 

“Many. Yes, it has happened be- 
fore. Beowulf Shaeffer, this is bad 
news. When the radiation from the 
Core reaches our worlds, it will 
sterilize them. We puppeteers will 
soon need considerable amounts of 
money. Shall I release you from

your contract, paying you nothing?” 
I laughed. I was too surprised even 
to get mad. “No.” 

“Surely you do not intend to 
enter the Core?” 

“No. Look, why do you — ” 
“Then by the conditions of our 
contract, you forfeit.” 

“Wrong again. I’ll take pictures 
of these instruments. When a court 
sees the readings on the radiation 
meter and the blue blur in the mass 
indicator, they’ll know something’s 
wrong with them.” 

“Nonsense. Under evidence drugs 
you will explain the readings.” 
“Sure. And the court will know 
you tried to get me to go right to 
the center of that holocaust. You 
know what they’ll say to that?” 
“But how can a court of law find 
against a recorded contract?” 

“The point is they’ll want to. 
Maybe they’ll decide that we’re both 
lying, and the instruments really 
did go haywire. Maybe they’ll find 
a way to say the contract was ille- 
gal. But they’ll find against you. 
Want to make a side bet?” 

“No. You have won. Come back.” 

VI 

T he Core was a lovely multicolor- 
ed jewel when it disappeared 
below the lens of the galaxy. I’d 
have liked to visit it some day; but 
there aren’t any time machines. 

Yd penetrated nearly to the Core 
in something like a month. I took 
my time coming home, going straight 
up along galactic north and flying 
above the lens where there were no 
stars to bother me, and still made 



it in two. All the way I wondered 
why the puppeteer had tried to cheat 
me at the last. Long Shot's publicity 
would have been better than ever; 
yet the regional president had been 
willing to throw it away just to 
leave me broke. I couldn’t ask why, 
because nobody was answering my 
hyperphone. Nothing I knew about 
puppeteers could tell me. I felt perse- 
cuted. 

My come-hither brought me down 
at the base in the Farside End. No- 
body was there. I took the transfer 
booth back to Sirius Mater, Jinx’s 
biggest city, figuring to contact Gen- 
eral Products, turn over the ship 
and pick up my pay. 

More surprises awaited me. 

1 ) General Products had paid 
one hundred and fifty thousand stars 
into my account in the Bank of 
Jinx. A personal note stated that 
whether I wrote my article was solely 
up to me. 

2) General Products has disap- 
peared. They are selling no more 
spacecraft hulls. Companies with 
contracts have had their penalty 
clauses paid off. It all happened two 
months ago, simultaneously on all 
known worlds. 

3) The bar I’m in is on the roof 
of the tallest building in Sirius Mater, 
more than a mile above the streets. 
Even from here I can hear the stock 
market crashing. It started with the 
the collapse of spacecraft companies 
with no hulls to build ships. Hun- 
dreds of others have followed. It 
takes a long time for an interstellar 
market to come apart at the seams, 
but, as with the Core novas. Nothing 
can stop the chain reaction. 



IF 




4) The secret of the indestructi- 
ble General fProducts hull is being 
advertised for sale. General Pro- 
ducts’ human representatives will col- 
lect bids for one year, no bid to be 
less than one trillion stars. Get in 
on the ground floor, folks. 

5) Nobody knows anything. That’s 
what’s causing most of the panic. It’s 
been a month since a puppeteer was 
seen on any known world. Why did 
they drop so suddenly out of inter- 
stellar affairs? 

I know. 

I n twenty thousand years a flood 
of radiation will wash over this 
region of space. Thirty thousand 
light-years may seem a long, safe 
distance, but it isn’t, not with this 
big an explosion. I’ve asked. The 
Core explosion will make this galaxy 
uninhabitable to any known form of 
life. 

Twenty thousand years is a long 
time. It’s four times as long as hu- 
man written history. We’ll all be 
less than dust before things get 
dangerous, and I for one am not go- 
ing to worry about it. 

But the puppeteers are different. 
They’re scared. They’re getting out 
right now. Paying off their penalty 
clauses and buying motors and other 
equipment to put in their industruct- 
tible hulls will take so much money 
that even confiscating my puny 
salary would have been a step to 



the good. Interstellar business can 
go to hell; from now on the pup- 
peteers will have no time for any- 
thing but running. 

Where will they go? Well, the 
galaxy is surrounded by a halo of 
small globular clusters. The ^ones 
near the rim might be safe. Or the 
puppeteers may even go as far as 
Andromeda. They have the Long 
Shot for exploring, if they come 
back for it, and they can build more. 
Outside the galaxy is space empty 
enough even for a puppeteer pilot, 
if he thinks his species is threatened. 

It’s a pity. This galaxy will be dull 
without puppeteers. Those two-head- 
ed monsters were not only the most 
dependable faction in interstellar 
business; they were like water in a 
wasteland of more-or-less human- 
oids. It’s too bad they aren’t brave, 
like us. 

But is it? 

I never heard of a puppeteer re- 
fusing to face a problem. He may 
merely be deciding how fast to run, 
but he’ll never pretend the problem 
isn’t there. Sometime within the next 
twenty millenia, we humans will 
have to move a population which al- 
ready numbers forty-three billion. 
How? To where? When should we 
start thinking about this? When the 
glow of the Core begins to shine 
through the dust clouds? 

Maybe men are the cowards — 
at the core. END

SCIENCE-FICTION 

FANWAYS 

by LIN CARTER 



Our Man in Fandom gives us another 
short couse in How to Be Fannish! 



More Nutty Fannish Slang 

L ast month, this column was de- 
voted to science fiction’s 
answer to the National Trivia Test, 
the fannish lingo. If you’re still with 
us lafter that guided tour through the 
brain-wringing byways of science- 
fiction slang, get set for some more 
of the same. 

Fans have always been prone to 
picking up catch-ptoases and intrigu- 
ing terms from their favorite reading 
matter. The late E.E. Smith (“Doc” 
Smith to his thousands of friends) 
was a fertile source for this sort of 
thing. In one or another of the six 
books that make up his supernovel, 
the “Lensman” series, Kimball Kin- 
nison and his chums used a sort of 
“future slang” that was probably the 
first such ever attempted in sci- 
ence fiction. Remember? — “QX” 
(okay); “she was a blinding flash 
and a deafening retort — a real 
seven-sector call-out” (she was a 



rather attractive young woman); 
“let’s flit, ace” (shall we go, pal?); 
“by Klono’s iridium intestines!” 
(gee whiz); “I check you to nine- 
teen decimals” (you are correct); 
and much more. 

Other terms were picked up from 
the science-fiction writers. In last 
month’s installment of this column, 
I discussed L. Sprague de Camp and 
Fletcher Pratt’s “Yngvi is a louse!” 
a catchy nonsense-phrase from their 
famous fantasy novel. The Incom- 
plete Enchanter, Popular British sci- 
ence-fiction writer, Eric Frank Rus- 
sell, has also contributed to the fan- 
nish slanguage ... or slannish fan- 
guage, whichever you prefer. In this 
novel Dreadful Sanctuary, one major 
scene hinges on the interesting and 
sort of philosophical phrase “How 
do you know you’re sane?” which 
promptly turned up in fanzines for 
years and years as a put-down or a 
one-up. 

But nonsense, or seeming non- 



46 





sense, remains the most popular form 
of fan slang. Old time sf writer Miles 
J. Breuer wrote a story around the 
phrase “The Gostak distims the 
doshes.” This phrase was never ex- 
plained in Breuer’s charming little 
Lewis Carroll type story, so the fans 
rushed in where Breuer feared to 
tread. The Fancy do pedia — which 
is just what it sounds like it is — 
defined this Breuerism for all time: 

Gostak: that by which the doshes 
are distimmed. 

distimming: that which charac- 
terizes the relation of the 
Gostak to the doshes (^.v.) 

doshes: those which are distimmed 
by the Gostak. 

So much for “real” nonsense. 
Now for that which just seems to be 
nonsensical, but actually makes sense 
if you are In. For example, dyktawo? 
— which sounds like it ought to be 
a word in High Barsoomian, but 
isn’t. This is naught but a simple 
acronym. (“Acronym” — that’s not 
a specimen of fan slang, gang, but a 
word you can look up in a “real” 
dictionary.) 

Twenty-some years ago, back dur- 
ing the late, unlamented Unpleasant- 
ness, when fans trying to buy mimeo- 
graph paper, stencils and other neces- 
sities of life found themselves smack 
up against the paper shortage, their 
howls of frustrated fanac (fan ac- 
tivity — like, say, publishing fan- 
zines) came up against the bland 
wartime store owners’: “Don’t you 
know there’s a war on?” As the Du- 
ration wore on — and on — this 
simple but maddening phrase became 



so noisomely familiar it was con- 
densed into the acronym dyktawo?, 
which became an all-purpose answer 
to just about any complaint. So con- 
venient was this unanswerable 
answer to all plaints, that its use 
continued even after the war ended 

— with a minor variant in meaning 

— as, “Don’t you know there’s a war 
overT* 

Another acronym is yhos. It may 
sound like one of Lovecraft’s evil 
gods, but it derives from the old- 
style closing of a letter, just before 
the signature: “Your humble, obedi- 
ent servant,” and the fans used it as 
a synonym for “me.” 

Twonk's Disease, and other Afflictions 

T hen there’s the word gafia — 
a psychic ill to which most 
fanzine publishers are prone. A fan 
who has not published an issue of his 
fanzine for quite some time is said 
to have fallen prey to this loathesome 
disease, namely gafiation. Oh, I 
guess it’s not really as bad as it 
sounds, for someone who is gafiating 
is merely succumbing to a desire 
to “get away from it all” — an- 
other smarty-pants acronym! In re- 
cent years, it has given rise to the 
fannish farewell, “See ya later, gafi- 
ator!” 

Another fannish disease, to which 
the skills of Dr. Spock, Dr. Salk 
and ,the Mayo Clinic combined 
could find no cure, is snearyism. 
This prevalent ill gained its name 
from its foremost proponent, a witty 
and lovable fan named Rick Sneary 
out in South Gate who ust to rite 
lettors to the science fictian magga-

zins thet wer spelt lik this. His mis- 
spellings were so constant and so 
unpredictable that a movement was 
once afoot to raise a fund and buy 
him a dictionary. Rick replied, af- 
fably: “I done need a dictonary. 
Whot I need is a secratery.” 

And then, of course, there’s the 
most horrendous of all ills — 
Twonk’s Disease. Nobody knows 
what it is, exactly, but it’s the ulti- 
mate of all human (including fan- 
nish) afflictions. 

Two other afflictions rival even 
Twonk’s Disease in their magnitude 
and horrendousness. These are call- 
ed Neohood and Completism, 

Completism sometimes strikes an 
aged or elderly fan. You never know 
just when the condition may arise. 
There you are, going merrily along 
reading and collecting the science- 
fiction magazines and purchasing an 
occasional hardcover book . and 
all of a sudden your eyes glaze, your 
hands begin to twitch with uncon- 
trollable greed . and you realize 
you yeam to have EVERYTHING 
in your collection. Every single sf 
paperback and hardcover ever pub- 
lished ... a copy of every single 
issue of every single last science-fic- 
tion or fantasy magazine ever print- 
ed, in America or England or 
wherever . gakk! You are a Com- 
pietist . ; poor slob! 

Neohood is worse in some ways, 
buf it’s curable in that you even- 
tually outgrow it, whereas the collec- 
tor’s lust toward Completism is never 
satisfied. This ailment strikes at 
young, over-enthusiastic neofans, 
who are (as the term implies) new 
come to the fan ranks. They tend 



to be boisterous and boresome, fran- 
tically collecting autographs and writ- 
ing endless (and pointless) letters to 
people of stellar magnitude, like Rob- 
ert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke, 
for no better reason than to boast to 
their friends they have received let- 
ters from Robert Heinlein and Ar- 
thur C. Clarke. Oh, well, I guess it’s 
a Step up from collecting bubble 
gum cards. 

The Great Staple War, dnd Others 

W "ay back in 1934, when we were 
very young, a chap with the un- 
likely name of “Bob Tucker” an- 
nounced the formation of a Society 
For The Prevention of Wire Staples 
in Science Fiction Magazines. Re- 
cruits flocked to the banner of the 
Cause . well, they got 35 mem- 
bers, anyway. This organization, 
which was known rather bafflingly 
as the SWPSSTFM (I say “baffling- 
ly” because the initials just don’t 
match the name)*, launched some 
ingenious idea like substituting rub- 
ber staples in place of the wire vari- 
ety, or sticking the science-fiction 
magazines together with chewing 
gum (a different flavor for each 
month . and if the magazine 
is so crummy you can’t read it, 
by golly you can chew it.) The 
SWPSSTFM published propaganda 
fanzines devoted to their Cause, 
some of which were held together by 
brads, others were sewn with white 



♦No. no Lin! It's SPWSSTFM, not 
SWPSSTFM . and if you remember 
that the old abbreviation for science 
fiction was “stf” (short for “scienti* 
fiction”) it all comes out right. — Editor.

silk thread, and so on : — including 
one issue of Tucker’s magazine which 
was fastened with a strip of gummy 
black bicycle tape up the left side. 

At last the superfan of the hour, 
Don Wollheim, could endure no 
more. He founded a counter-organi- 
zation yclept the International and 
Allied Organizations for the Purpose 
of Upholding and Maintaining the 
Use of Metallic Fasteners in Science 
Fiction Pubhcations in the United 
States of America, Unlimited. This 
was known as the lAOPUMUMFP- 
USA, Unltd, for short. 

Thus, with the roll of drums and 
the flourish of trumpets, was launch- 
ed The First Great Staple War. With 
Wollheim as Grand High Cocolor um 
and crony Kenneth Sterling as Ex- 
alted Grand Booleywag of the 
lAOPetc, the conflict was joined. A 
military force was formed, called 
the Ultra-Violet Shirt Sho(^ked 
Troops, which published their of- 
ficial propaganda publication, known 
as The Polymorphanucleated Leu- 
cocytCf which denounced the policies 
advocated by Tucker as Dictator of 
the SWPSetc and his second officer, 
Robert W. Lowndes (since editor of 
several science-fiction magazines), 
who rejoiced in the title of Royal 
Pill Roller. 

Wollheini issued proposals which 
went beyond mere advocacy of the 
use of humdrum wire staples. He 
actually suggested The Platinum 
Plan, under which system the sf 
magazines were urged to use staples 
fashioned of pure platinum, the idea 
being that, after the reader had fin- 
ished with an issue he could then 
pry out the precious staples and sell 



the metal for many times what he 
paid for the magazine. This scheme, 
of course, would make for a science- 
fiction boom as soon as The General 
Public caught on. Countless thou- 
sands would storm the newstands to 
buy science-fiction magazines, which 
in no time at all would be outselhng 
even the Reader* s Digest from coast 
to coast. 

Then there was another conflict 
called the Great Stationery Duel, 
but this was a “local” war between 
two fans only. Jack Speer and Dick 
Wilson challenged each other to a 
contest in which each was to write 
to the other using a different letter- 
head or kind of stationery in each 
letter, and the first who gave out 
was defeated. 

Both fans are said to have de- 
veloped very specialized forms of 
advanced kleptomania during the 
course of the war, snitching letter- 
head from motels, hotels, offices and 
so on. They worked out a fantastical- 
ly elaborate code of rules as to just 
what was “a different type of sta- 
tionery”. The code forbade the pur- 
chase of stationery for duelling 
uses. For a time they bombarded 
each other with curt missives writ- 
ten on the letterhead of this or that 
plumber, sanitary engineer, junk col- 
lector or dentist, until eventually one 
member of the contest gave out (I 
can’t say whether he succumbed to 
an attack of gafia or what); where- 
upon the survivor (Speer) was chal- 
lenged to a continuation of the bat- 
tle by Harry Warner, Jr., and for all 
I know the fearful combat may still 
be blazing away via the courtesy of 
the U.S. Mail. END

Sign of Gree was still resolvable — 

T he wan bluish light of a distant four vertical bars plus a horizontal

of dust motes off to one side. cases, dead ones. 

They were derelicts, all right — He raised to his mouth an object 
fourteen scoutships floating in aim- like a very fat metal pencil and spoke 
less paths, jagged black holes agape into it. “Colonel Duke here. I was

too far ^way to see all Fd have liked, 
but the ambush was pretty much like 
the one Fazzool described. The 
Remm Task Force spaced in, launch- 
ed a salvo, nulled immediately, 
spaced in on the opposite side, 
launched another and nulled again. I 
emphasize: they were out of, into, 
out of and back into null again, all 
within four seconds. The Gree 
scoutship squadrons had to sacrifice 
themselves to give Gree capital ships 
time to build up nulling charges. If 
the Remm had appeared again with 
a third salvo from another angle, 
they’d have really clobbered the Gree 
main force. Maybe they couldn’t, or 
maybe they didn’t want to risk their 
own ships. As it was, several Gree 
heavies took hits but escaped. 

“Fazzool’s report was correct. The 
Remm are able to null the same ship 
at least three times in quick succes- 
sion. These were not, repeat not, 
two duplicate forces. I saw minor 
damage taken the first time they 
popped out, and it was there when 
they came back. 

“In view of our previous disastrous 
attempts to contact the Remm, I’m 
adopting my primary plan of posing 
as a Gree Slave Warrior and being 
taken prisoner. My priorities will be 
as follows: One, learn how the 

Remm null without the delay to build 
up charges; Two, pinpoint the Remm 
home region; Three, if the Remm 
are reasonable beings, initiate con- 
tact. 

“A fourth objective will be to 
learn why the Remm are skirmish- 
ing with the Gree Empire, and a 
fifth will be to learn, if possible, what 
happened to Fazzool. But these and 



any other intelligence will be con- 
ditional upon my getting the pri<Mity 
information and bringing or sending 
it out. 

“I am going to join the Slaves 
now. I’ll use my old name of Jen, 
in case I look familiar to anyone, but 
I won’t let the Jen personality sur- 
face. Ends.” 

He twisted one end of the metal 
object, pushed it from him, and put 
his hands over his ears. Even so, the 
implosion was loud as it nulled away. 
Then he slewed the bag around and 
applied drive toward the derelicts. 

Before he got there, one of the 
Remm ships suddenly appeared a 
few miles beyond, and he got his first 
good look at it. 

I t was quite impractical from the 
familiar standpoints of construc- 
tion and repair. Instead of being an 
end-to-end stack of flat cylinders, 
like the ships of Gree or his own 
side, it consisted of two huge globes, 
fixed together at a separation of 
about one radius by three triangular- 
ly spaced booms or tubes. Those — 
if he were judging distance and size 
right — would be thick enough to 
enclose not only passageways but 
compartments. Nowhere upon the 
ship could he see weld-lines; it must 
have been cast integrally or poured 
in perfectly blending increments. 

Suddenly he realized he could see 
stars through one of the globes. There 
were no outlines within; just the 
translucent globe, with the brighter 
stars beyond gleaming through it. 
The other globe was quite opaque. 

The Gree survivors near him were 
making hasty hand signals back and

forth. One, a Gunner Third (the 
same rank Steve had attained as a 
Gree Slave) but a B’lant, not a hu- 
man, signaled, “We could try to 
reach one of the derelicts and find 
some operable weapon.” 

Another of the gray-skinned, hair- 
less humanoids replied, “Futile. 
We’d be incinerated before we moved 
ten yards. Better to be taken and 
tell the Goodness and Might of Gree 
to these foolish strangers.” 

Steve was happy to see the latter 
viewpoint prevail. 

The huge ship moved slowly 
toward them. On one side of one 
^obe, an opening suddenly appeared. 
Since it was just big enough to ad- 
mit a bag comfortably, the meaning 
was obvious. Like well trained Slave 
Warriors, the drifting survivors be- 
gan to maneuver their bags into a 
file, in rough order of rank. That 
made Steve hustle to take his place 
near the front. 

There were sixty-odd in the line 
(other bags, holding inert bodies, 
drifted away) of which only two 
other than Steve were men. He 
counted seventeen of the leather- 
skinned B’lant. All the rest were 
Sabrils — tall, slope-shouldered, 
dark blue. Sabrils were good fight- 
ing stock, but emotional and not very 
logical. They seldom reached the top 
Slave ranks and consequently now 
formed the rear of the line. 

The first bags were entering the 
huge ^ ship. Steve, in his turn, 
maneuvered through the hole. 

T he cubicle compartment could 
occupy only a small sector of 
the vast globe; nevertheless, the 



spacebags floated in it without 
crowding. The last Sabril came in, 
and the opening vanished. Now 
there was diffuse light from several 
sources. Artificial gravity came on, 
very weak at first so that the bags 
settled slowly to the “floor”. At the 
same time, Steve noticed that his bag 
was less rigid, which meant atmo- 
sphere was building up in the com- 
partment. By the time he was down, 
the bag was quite limp. 

A voice, with a liquid, unfamiliar 
accent but speaking fair B’lant, 
boomed loud enough to be heard 
through the plastic, ‘The air is 
breathable. Leave your bags. All 
weapons, including knives, must be 
left in them. Go, one at a time, 
through the door that appears, and 
walk along the corridor. You will be 
automatically photographed as you 
walk. By the time you are assembled 
again you will be over the planet 
where you are to be interned. If you 
co-operate, you will not be harmed.” 

Steve unsealed one hub of his bag, 
laid it carefully inside and squirmed 
out the opening. He stood, unob- 
trusively checking over his Gree uni- 
form to make sure it was correct. 
There was a buzz of talk now, as 
other prisoners emerged from their 
bags — some of it in B’lant; some 
in Sabril. He met the eyes of a B’lant 
Gunner, Third, and to avoid talk 
made a gesture of resignation. 

When the door appeared it was as 
suddenly and as unpredictably as the 
outside opening. He took his place 
in line and walked along the corri- 
dor. Near the end of that he had the 
mild momentary sensation of discon- 
tinuity that meant they had null-

jumped. It happened again as he 
emerged into a big room, and a 
third time a little later. The door 
closed behind the last of the prison- 
ers. 

The artificial gravity was steadily 
growing. It must be nearly one and 
one-third Ter ran G now, and the 
Sabrils were showing discomfort. 
Steve looked around him. Three walls 
of the room were lined by low, very 
broad stools — circular, a good five 
feet across, three-legged and rough- 
ly made from some hard wood. They 
looked quite new. Without waiting 
for invitations, he walked over and 
sat down opposite where the door 
had been. Others followed suit. He 
avoided looking at any of them too 
long. The less he talked, the better; 
it had been several years since he’d 
spent any length of time with Gree 
Slaves. 

Twenty minutes by his chrono- 
meter passed. Then, above where the 
door had been, a big section of metal 
bulkhead vanished. 

Recessed a few inches was a view- 
screen showing rugged mountains, 
seen from above, slowly drifting. 
That went on for a few minutes, 
then the scene began to expand as 
if the ship were dropping. He heard 
from somewhere the thrumming of 
air on a hull. 

The alien voice suddenly spoke 
again. “You will see your prison 
valley. It will not be luxurious, but 
you can live there until your future 
is decided. Escape on foot will be 
impossible. There is nowhere to go. 
When we land, you are to stay in a 
group apart from the prisoners al- 
ready there, until we have interro- 



gated each of you briefly. Then you 
will be permitted to join them.” 

T he scene swelled and the valley 
became visible. It might, Steve 
judged, be ten miles long or more, 
roughly oval, with a river splitting 
it and a small lake at the lower end. 
Most of it was grassy, but thick 
growths of trees lined the river, and 
a few small tributaries, surrounded 
the lake ,and covered the lower moun- 
tain slopes around the spot. ' 

They were still moving laterally. 
Now they passed over a herd of 
grazing animals which, judging by 
the size relative to the trees, must be 
fifteen feet long, low-built, with four 
pairs of legs each. They gave the 
impression of giant caterpillars, but 
looked vertebrate. Then a stretch of 
grass and suddenly, near the river 
at the valley’s upper end, a cluster 
of huts with tiny humanoid figures 
about them. The grass had been 
cleared, as if they’d been here for 
some time. There were campfires — 
startling in their brightness, for the 
screen’s intensity was turned up — 
in what seemed to be a pattern of 
sentry-^posts around the encampment. 
Now that he noticed, there were vir- 
tually no shadows in the valley. It 
must be dawn or dusk. 

The ship was down to a few hun- 
dred feet when the humanoids on 
the ground began to look up. Then, 
singly and in small groups, they 
drifted toward what must be the 
landing-spot. 

The screen went off, and the wall 
reappeared. Now the ship settled 
slowly, hung, and touched down. An- 
other wait, then an exit appeared. 



54 



IF 




Steve queued up, stepped out onto 
grass — no cleared field — and 
noted that the gravity matched the 
ship’s. That had been deliberate, 
then. 

The mountains around the valley 
were higher even than they’d looked, 
and the only daylight was a strong 
glow above them, to one side. The 
sky, in the other direction, was deep 
blue. Stars hung like multicolored 
lanterns. He gave a second startled 
look at them. Some of the reddish 
ones showed actual disks! 

They’d nulled into a very dense 
star-cluster. 

The alien voice warned again, 
“Stay in a group. You may call to 
the others, but if you attempt to 
mingle with them you will be shot.” 

The prisoners from the camp were 
still a hundred yards away, approach- 
ing slowly. 

It was about that moment that 
Steve realized the bulk looming be- 
hind him was not the huge double- 
globe ship, but a much smaller cylin- 
drical craft. It must have been in- 
side the big one. At some time, may- 
be in leaving the first compartment, 
they’d entered it without knowing. 

He turned to watch the approach- 
ing mob. A hundred or more, not 
counting sentries left behind at the 
camp — Sabrils, B’lant, a few men, 
in about the same proportion as his 
own group; plus a few thick-muscled 
Gjiss to whom this gravity was like 
home. Most wore Gree uniforms, 
more or less deteriorated; some wore 
crude leather garments. A few car- 
ried bows with nock^ arrows and 
were alert, as if there might be dan- 
gerous animals in the valley. 



His eyes fell upon a B’lant in very 
old boots, short trousers cut from a 
uniforni, and a thin leather jerkin. 
The blunt gray features weren’t much 
different from any B’lant’s, but 
Steve’s pulse leaped. 

Fantastic — Fazzool’s being here! 
Suspicious, even! 

But maybe not. Fazzool’s sketchy 
report had said the Remm seemed 
not to have much of a foothold in 
this part of the galaxy (if, indeed, 
they were a large empire anywhere). 
Quite possibly — almost certainly, 
reasoning by probability — if he and 
Fazzool had both been brought here, 
this was the only prison camp they 
had. 

He made a small sign that Fazzool 
would see, then turned away. 

II 

T he Remm voice said, “Wait.” 
Still the captors didn’t show 
themselves. 

Now there was shouted communi- 
cation between the prisoners, but 
Steve did not take part. He was busy 
studying the alien ship. Like the big 
one, it was of smooth metal, all in 
one piece. He could see no openings; 
not even the one from which he’d 
emerged. He supposed they might 
open weapon-ports wherever they 
wished. 

He turned his attention to the val- 
ley. The grass was short but quite 
thick and green. It, or the ground, 
smelled slightly dank. He bent to 
feel of it. The ground was moist. 
Also, it was warm. Maybe, then, this 
was a hotter climate than he’d guess- 
ed from the valley’s greenness. He 



THE SIGN OF GREE 



55 




looked at the glow above the moun- 
tains, trying to see whether it had 
grown brighter or dimmer. He 
couldn’t tell. 

However — if he didn’t imagine 
it — the glow had moved laterally. 

As time passed, he was certain. 
That, then, was the planet’s sun — 
but it wasn’t rising or setting. He 
was near one of the poles. But the 
glow was moving pretty fast. He esti- 
mated degrees as well as he could 
and came up with a planetary ro- 
tation of ten or twelve hours. 

The ground’s warmth, then, was 
volcanic, or simply warmth from a 
hot core. 

So — near a pole or not (the 
south one, observing the sun-glow’s 
direction of movement) — the valley 
was livable, though the gravity would 
be a nuisance. 

With that thought, his situation 
suddenly bothered him. If they simp- 
ly dumped him here, how was he go- 
ing to learn anything about them? 

His orders were explicit, and the 
reason behind them good. He daren’t 
reveal his true alliance, and Faz- 
zool’s, until he knew about them. So 
far, they’d been very trigger-happy; 
and the Effogan forces, hastily 
scraped together from inadequate 
bits, had a desperate enough task 
resisting Gree. 

He had to ‘get out of the valley, 
and get Fazzool out, too. Even with 
the B’lant patience, Fazzool was no 
doubt almost wild. 

Like the others, he was sitting 
now. Then someone spotted two air- 
cars coming down. 

The new craft were grav-driven 
cargo types, like fifty-foot boxes 



with clear windshields at one end 
for the pilots. They landed a little 
beyond the spaceship. Hatches (no 
magic openings this time, but ordi- 
nary, mechanically controlled doors) 
opened. Creatures spilled out. It 
wasn’t until Steve saw that they wore 
hand-guns and took up regular 
guard-positions that he realized these 
were the Remm. 

They were not humanoid. He 
ignored the shiver along jiis spine 
and studied the nearest one. 

T he Remm was compact but 
muscular enough to weigh three 
times as much as a man. His body 
was like some bunchy feline’s, ex- 
cept that the tail was only two feet 
long and rather clubby. The forelegs 
were wider-set and heavier than the 
hind ones, no doubt to carry the 
weight of the very thick, two-foot- 
high neck that thrust up above the 
wide chest. Maybe neck wasn’t the 
word, for, Just below the broad head, 
a pair of short muscular arms grew. 
They seemed to have more than two 
joints and ended in blunt strong 
hands of two fingers and a thumb 
each. The claws on the hands were 
trimmed, which was not true of the 
four feet. The wide head had a good 
braincase and a short muzzle that 
showed carnivore’s teeth. The eyes 
were wide apart, slitted, deep-set, 
yellow irised, round-pupiled, intelli- 
gent. The creature had short thick 
fur, nearly black in the poor light, 
and wore nothing except a belt 
around the base of the neck, to carry 
a bolstered energy-pistol. 

The others looked identical and 
behaved like a military squad. They

IF 




hardly needed to draw the pistols — 
espe(^y as they moved very easily 
in this valley’s gravity. 

A voice from one of the aircars — 
Remm, but speaking much better 
B’lant than the other one — said, 
“Line up by seniority and enter 
the rear hatch one at a time as 
called.” 

Steve let the B’lant Gunners, 
Third, go ahead of him. The first 
was only in the cargo van five min- 
utes, then he emerged from a side 
door and walked in silence toward 
the crowd of earlier prisoners. That 
pattern continued until it was Steve’s 
turn. He stepped in and halted with 
sudden dismay. The white-enameled 
door facing him bore the Sign of 
Gree. It was that of an Inquisition 
Booth. 

Then he realized the Remm must 
have captured it and adapted it for 
their own interrogating. He moved 
forward, the door opened and he 
stepped in. 

is Gree?'' 

ff The Voice was studiedly 
deep, fatherly, reassuring. Steve knew 
there were subtle drugs in the air of 
the Booth. The Jen personality in 
him welled up, brought a sob to his 
throat, tried to surface. He fought 
it down. ThisT was no time to get 
mired in that bog. Suddenly, he re- 
alized this was his chance. He had to 
go through the Litany, of course — 
as any Gree Slave would — but he 
let his voice sound surly. “Gree is 
Love. Gree is Protection. Gree is 
Wisdom; the only Sustenance.” 

The Booth definitely hesitated be- 
fore resuming the ritual. He made 



the responses listlessly, hoping the 
real anxiety in his mind wouldn’t be 
mistaken for the loyal emotions. An- 
other wait, while the mechanical per- 
ceptors probed him, then the exit 
door opened. In the darkness be- 
yond, the side hatch of the cargo van 
yawned. Hope falling,, he walked 
slowly toward it. 

But there was a ripple of liquid 
syllables outside, and one of the 
alien guards gestured unmistakably 
that Steve was to precede him to the 
other aircar. 

The rearmost compartment of this 
one was well lit (but with make- 
shift lighting) and furnished with 
two of the low broad stools. On one 
reclined a Remm. The creature ges- 
tured to the other stool. “Sit, if you 
wish.” 

Steve sat, and heard the hatch 
close behind him. This Remm, he 
thought, was the one whose voice 
had come from the other aircar — 
at least, the B’lant was as good. This 
one’s fur was shaggier than that of 
the guards, touched with gray around 
the muzzle and the tips of the small 
erect ears and around the claws of 
all four feet. He wore no weapon. 
In place of the holster with a small 
medallion of some silvery medal. 

The alien studied him a minute, 
glancing at the Gunner, Third, in- 
signia below the Gree symbol on 
the breast of Steve’s uniform. “What 
is your name?” 

“Jen,” Steve lied. 

The next question startled him. 
“Are you one of the Overseer race?” 

“Why . of course not. They 
don’t look at all like me.” 

The Remm shifted its weight, like 



THE SIGN OF GREE 



57 




some great feline. “We have never 
seen an Overseer. But you are no 
ordinary Slave; you did not respond 
emotionally to the Booth. Why?” 
Steve tried to hide his excitement. 
“The Booths are a fraud. Especially 
when they’re stolen by enemies.” 

The Remm’s teeth showed in what 
might be a smile. “All the Slaves we 
have tested in the Booth showed the 
emotional response, except you. If 
you realize the Booths are a fraud, 
you must have similar ideas about 
some of the other nonsense.” 

Steve growled, “You’re not going 
to trap me into treason.” 

The Remm said reasonably, “Since 
you’ve seen through the frauds, 
whether you admit it or not, you 
must realize that the whole aim of 
Gree is conquest, using you as dupes. 
Consider how readily you’re sacri- 
ficed, while the Overseers are care- 
fully guarded. The loyalty of that 
race has been purchased, and the 
payment continues. If you’re worried 
about comrades, or about worlds that 
are dear to you, be assured we mean 
no aggressive war on the Gree Em- 
pire. We were attacked without warn- 
ing, and are only raiding to learn 
what we need to know to defend 
ourselves. Help us, and we’ll give you 
freedom. Luxury. Even deliver you 
to some free world if it’s within our 
power to do so. The alternative is 
this prison valley. You’ll find it 
very dull.” 

Steve avoided the alien’s eyes. 
“No one likes to be a traitor.” 
“Consider this,” the Remm said. 
“The longer it takes us to learn 
what we must know, the more raids 
we’ll have to make. You’ll be helping 



your fellow Slaves of the Empire by 
helping us.” 

S teve pretended to mull that over. 

Finally he said, “How do I know 
you’re only defending yourselves? 
You might be worst tyrants than — ” 
He pretended to break off in con- 
fusion. 

The alien’s teeth showed again. 
“Than Gree?” 

Steve averted his eyes. “Yes.” He 
let a minute pass, then looked up. 
“What would I have to do?” 

“First of all,” the Remm said, 
“We’ll take you to another place 
where we can talk at more leisure, 
and you’ll be more comfortable. Un- 
derstand, you really don’t have any 
choice. Aside from torture or drugs, 
we have only to play back your re- 
sponses to the Booth, and this con- 
versation, for your fellow prisoners. 
They’d fear you to bits. But we’d 
rather not.” 

Steve let himself look a little 
frightened. “Well . .” 

The Remm got to his feet and 
hopped lightly off the broad stool. 
“I’m glad you’re being intelligent. 
Do you think any others of the new 
arrivals have similar thoughts?” 
Steve — though he knew he was 
being impulsive — jumped at the 
chance. “I don’t know. None of 
them are from my ship. But there’s 
one of the older prisoners — I just 
happened to catch a glimpse of him 
— whom I used to know. And 
he . .” 

The Remm waited a moment, then 
asked, “What’s his name?” 
“Fazzool.” 

The alien looked at him so long 

IF

Steve began to wonder if he'd stepped 
into a Finally the teeth showed 
again. “Perhaps I’ll talk to him. By 
the way, I am called Egral. I am in 
charge of all prisoner interrogation.” 

m 

A lone in the cargo compartment 
during a long flight, Steve had 
nothing to do but think. 

If the valley were the Remm’s only 
prison camp (for Gree Slaves, at 
least) then he was probably on the 
way now to some Remm base. Once 
he saw that, he might be considered 
as knowing too much. 

Certainly he wouldn’t be allowed to 
rejoin the other Slaves. Obviously 
the reason for flying the Interroga- 
tion setup to the valley was to keep 
them in ignorance of the base. 

He didn’t expect it to be much of 
an establishment. The crude wooden 
stools (designed for Remm, not hu- 
manoids) were one bit of evidence. 
They’d certainly not come from 
a sawmill. Probably they’d been 
made from slabs cut with a laser 
tool, then scraped with some metal 
blade. The huts in the valley were 
of similar lumber. And these air- 
cars — if he knew the indications, 
they were actually cargo-lighters 
from a spaceship. So the planet 
wasn’t settled. 

He hoped he hadn’t put Fazzool 
in a jam. 

Hours passed. They were travelling 
fast; hundreds of miles must have 
unreeled by now. He was hungry 
and thirsty, and it had been quite 
a while since he slept. He tried that 
now, couldn’t. The aircar hurtled on. 



He thought they might have gone 
several thousand miles before the 
speed slackened and the craft slanted 
down. They landed, and, stiff from 
sitting, he got up, impatient for the 
hatch to open. 

It was then he realized he wa3 
no longer in heavy gravity. It was 
less than one G now. He stood, one 
hand resting on a bulkhead, and pon- 
dered. Surely this cargo tub didn’t 
have artificial gravity. Then were 
they inside a ship? No; there had 
been the airstream on the hull. 

The hatch opened, and he saw 
stony ground, faintly lit by starlight 
or weak artificial light. As he 
stepped out the first thing that took 
his eyes was one of the huge double- 
globe ships, looming behind some 
buildings that were only dimly lit 
and almost as crude as the huts, 
though bigger. Barracks, he thought. 
A larger one that was probably a 
hangar seemed put together from 
sections of curved ships’ hulls. 

T he base was in a fairly narrow 
river valley, and other ships or 
buildings might be hidden behind a 
curve, but the place didn’t have that 
feel. There were sounds of hammer- 
ing and the intermittent rasp of an 
arc welder or cutting-torch. A few 
Remm loped about silently, wraith- 
like in the semidarkness. The stars 
were the same close-in ones, tending 
to red, he’d seen from the valley. 
That they didn’t dazzle his eyes more 
now, at night, meant there was nebu- 
lar-cloud matter partially obscuring 
them, which was normal for such a 
dense cluster. 

On both slopes of the canyon. 



THE SIGN OF GREE

islands of primitive incandescent 
bulbs were no doubt weapons em- 
placements. Not heavy stuff, to fight 
off attacks from space, but light 
missile-launchers or beamers, for re- 
pelling ground attack or atmospheric 
bombers. They could prevent capture 
of the base, but not its destruction. 
Of course, there might be heavier 
stuff out of sight. Or the big ships 
might launch the ground-to-space 
missiles. 

He hadn’t much time to see more, 
because Egral emerged from the 
pilot’s compartment of the aircar 
and hustled him to one of the wooden 
buildings. “I’ll arrange a bath and 
something to shave with and send 
food to your room. Will a sleeping- 
pad be all right? We don’t have ac- 
commodations here for humanoids.” 

Steve said tiredly, “A pad will be 
fine.” 

They locked him in, of course, 
and he could hear a guard in the 
corridor outside. But the freshly- 
cooked meat was good, only a little 
gamey, and the boiled grain with it 
wasn’t bad, and the bath (in what 
looked like half a missile-case) was 
hot; and the sleeping-pad was better 
than various things he’d slept on. He 
didn’t even lie awake worrying. 

The five or six hours of night 
seemed gone in an instant. Egral 
gave him a few minutes to dress, 
then hurried him to the other end 
of^the building. “Wendar, who wants 
to talk to you, is one of the two top 
aides to the Commanding Officer 
of this region.” 

W endar’ s desk was metal and 
probably taken from some 



ship. It was ordinary except that it 
was low and of a size for the short 
Remm arms. The seat behind it was 
one of the squat stools, upon which 
Wendar sprawled casually. He wore 
no clothing, but had one of the me- 
dallions. His fur was definitely gray- 
ing, and his teeth, when they show- 
ed, were yellow and worn down. He 
eyed Steve for a moment, then es- 
sayed B’lant: “I not strong in your 
speak. Egral will ... go between.” 
He put his stubby hands on the desk- 
edge and shifted his weight on the 
stool, rumbling liquid Remm speech 
meanwhile. 

Egral translated, “Are you ready 
to help us without reservation?” 

Steve muttered, “Yes.” 

Egral’s next translation was long- 
er. “It is desirable that we capture 
one or more Overseers. Can you tell 
us how to do that without a serious 
battle?” 

Steve felt dismay. That would take 
a lot of scheming and spying and 
preparation. “I can tell you,” he said 
hesitantly, “where to find important 
bases, reckoning from where I was 
captured. But to take an Over- 
seer ...” 

The older Remm’s look was con- 
temptuous, his question gruffer. 
Egral rendered it as, “Are you afraid 
to betray an Overseer?” 

“No. But they’re well protected. 
Command ships don’t expose them- 
selves.” 

Egral translated Wendar’s further 
growl as, “Those ships that are not 
commanded by Overseers — how do 
they navigate? Who operates their 
computers?” 

“Why,” Steve said, “unless they’re 



60 



IF 




locked into central control by a 
Command Ship, Computer Techs 
operate them. Haven’t you captured 
apy?” After a moment he risked, 
“Why is it necessary to capture an 
Overseer?” 

The two Remm conferred. Wendar 
growled in B’lant, “Slaves work on 
computers?” 

“Certainly. I know some computer 
technology myself, though it isn’t 
my specialty.” 

There was another conference, 
more animated, then Egral asked, 
“Could you do anything with a com- 
puter that’s programmed in the Over- 
seer language?” 

“Why, I — ” Steve broke off, 
thinking hard. “Is it possible you 
only want an Overseer so you can 
learn his language?” 

They both eyed him, silently and 
with hostility now. His blood pumped 
faster. If he handled this right . 

“Slaves are not supposed to know 
any of that language, but it happens 
that I was in a situation once wh6re 
I learned some of it, secretly. I 
think . that may have been the 
start of my doubts.” 

The effect on the aliens was 
startling. Wendar was up in a flash, 
forepaws oh the edge of the desk, 
hands clenched. He spewed Remm. 
Egral, tail lashing, said hurriedly, 
“This we vow. If you will translate 
certain memory banks into B’lant, 
you will receive the best treatment 
we can give you! You will not be 
asked to betray your Empire further. 
And we will pledge our honor not 
to take any aggressive action that is 
not forced upon us.” 

Steve, his feelings mixed, faced 



them. It was not his aim to bring; 
about any truce between them and^ 
Gree. But he had a solid fulcrun^^ 
now, if he could apply the leverage 
right. He said slowly, “I would need 
someone who knew the actual sci- 
ence of computers better than I.” 
He looked at Egral. “That B’lant I 
mentioned ...” 

Egral was suddenly motionless, 
eyes intent, teeth showing in the 
Remm smile. Presently he purred 
something to Wendar. Wendar con- 
sidered and grunted a reply. Egral 
said, “Yes, Fazzool. He is on his 
way here already. When he arrives, 
I think we shall take another little 
trip. But I warn you. Though we 
have been lenient with you prisoners 
until now, we are not squeamish in 
punishing trickery. Do not attempt 
it.” 

Steve, furious at himself, said 
nothing. Why did he always have to 
push things so? Now Egral was 
definitely suspicious. And Steve’s 
gambit had been unnecessary. 

IV 

44^omrade.” Fazzool’s voice was 

^ quiet, but there was emotion 
in his head-clasp. They were in the 
cargo van of another aircar, hurtling 
somewhere. Steve didn’t care whether 
there were listening devices; he and 
the B’laiit could talk in English, 
guardedly. 

The gray-skinned humanoid 
grinned. “I did not expect to be re- 
moved from ze valley so soon.” 

“Maybe it was too soon,” Steve 
said glumly. “They’re suspicious 
now.” 



THE SIGN OF GREE 



61 




Fazzool shrugged. “Anyone must 
be suspicious, dealing wiz strangers. 
Ze question is, what do zese crea- 
tures want here? And where is here?” 
Steve began almost to wish Egral 
did understand some English. It 
would be amusing to swap informa- 
tion with Fazzool, without giving 
Egral any. “In a dense star cluster, 
somewhere.” 

“Zat is certainly true; and zey 
must know zere way in it, or nulling 
would be suicide. But I mean, on zis 
planet. I have not been out of ze 
valley before. Ze gravity ... I will 
swear it is getting steadily less, as we 
travel. If it were equatorial spin . .” 
Steve shook his head. “Haven’t 
you seen the sun today? It’s still not 
going to get much above the hori- 
zon. Anyway, it would take a rotation 
several times faster to offset gravity 
to this extent. Well, aside from that. 
What do you make of things? Pret- 
ty primitive in some ways, eh?” 

“Zey did not act primitive in ze 
battle when I was captured.” 

Steve grinned inwardly. So Faz- 
zool, too, had posed as a Gree 
Slave Warrior. “I got the same im- 
pression. So this is a trivial base for 
them.” 

“Unless,” Fazzool said, “all zat is 
just stage dressing. I do not see, zo, 
why zey should care to fool prison- 
ers.” 

“Maybe,” Steve said, “there is 
someone else they want to fool. It 
would be unwise to judge them on 
the basis of rough lumber.” Fazzool 
would get the message. They were 
still not to reveal their own true 
connections until they learned more 
about the Remm. 



Fazzool grinned, rather widely for 
a B’lant. 

The flight stretched on. For a 
time it sounded as if they flew 
through rain or hail. Outside, it must 
be night again, by Steve’s chrono- 
meter. 

After some hours a sniall hatch 
slid open, and Egral peered back at 
them. “We still have a way to go. 
Do you want some cold meat? I 
cannot offer you any of the grain; 
we have some along but there is 
no way to cook it.” 

“The meat will be fine,” Steve 
said. He and Fazzool chewed on 
it and talked innocently in B’lant of 
past campaigns, of the Hive World 
where they’d met and competed in 
the training-games and finally won 
their way to the Advanced Academy, 
of comrades who were gone. 

Finally the aircar began to des- 
cend. 

It landed, there was a short wait, 
the rear hatch opened, and brilliant 
yellow sunlight poured in. Steve, 
blinking, tried to see his chrono- 
meter. It shouldn’t be morning yet. 
But it was. He unkinked hims elf and 
stepped out, realizing as he did that 
the gravity couldn’t be as much as 
half a G. 

G rass had been scythed down to 
form a tan matting. Fifty yards 
from the aircar, untouched grass 
stood shoulder-high, thick and lushly 
green. He could smell it, slightly 
musty but sweet. Insects like dragon- 
flies with eight-inch wings flapped 
leisurely above it. He filled his lungs 
with the air. The pressure was the 
same as in the prison valley. With a 



THE SIGN OF GREE

planet hold an atmosphere? Maybe 
surface gravity like this, how did a 
this gravity and that nearer the poles 
averaged out. Which reminded him 
to check the sun. It still wasn’t much 
above the horizon, though air and 
grass were dry enough to suggest it 
had been up a while. 

Egral appeared and led the way 
around the aircar, four armed Remm 
falling in behind Steve and Fazzool, 
and Steve saw why he’d been brought 
here. 

At the limit of the clearing, near 
a tremendous wall or forest, lay a 
spaceship. It was a large auxiliary of 
some kind, compK)sed in the orthodox 
way of five sections, each a flat 
cylinder. The Sign of Gree was pro- 
minent on its hull. At least two of 
the sections were holed. It had never 
been heavily armed, and now what 
gunports it had were empty. 

The trees beyond towered hun- 
dreds of feet, well foliaged in light 
green, vaguely pinelike but with 
globular crowns at the top. They 
were not close-packed, letting con- 
sidefable yellow sunlight into the 
forest. Parasite plants of various 
colors grew in them; vines sent long 
roots to the ground. Huge birds flap- 
ped about lazily, with low hoarse 
cries. 

Steve looked around for signs of 
battle.' NQne. He said to Fazzool in 
English, “Probably captured and 
brought here. The drive being dam- 
aged, they landed it where the gravity 
was light.” 

Fazzool nodded. “But what type is 
it? I see no cargo hatches. And zose 
gunports — not quite right, eh?” 

Egral, annoyed, dropped back be- 



side them. “If you’re discussing the 
ship, it was k training vessel for 
Overseers. There’s material in it in 
the Overseer language that you’re to 
translate. Also damage to some of 
the memory-banks must be repaired.” 

“Oh!” Steve studied the ship as 
they walked toward it. He knew 
Fazzool would be wondering the 
same thing he was — just what did 
the Remm want so badly to know? 

There were Remm watching from 
various of the ship's gunports, but 
nowhere did he see any weapons 
larger than hand guns. Schemes be- 
gan stirring in his mind. Suppose he 
could actually get control of the 
ship — seal it up, a few compart- 
ments at least, and null it away 
somewhere? 

Would the Remm be that foolish? 
What if Fazzool were right and this 
were all a fake? Suppose they 
deliberately let Steve (presuming 
him to be a loyal Gree partisan after 
all, if not a Slave) steal the ship and 
bring a Gree Task Force to the spot? 
The seemingly unsettled planet might 
erupt with weapons. There was that 
anomalous gravity . Far-fetched, 
but possible. 

They neared the ship. A small 
hatch, about thirty feet above ground 
in the curve of the middle section, ‘ 
opened. Several Remm began 
manually letting down a board ramp. 
Rough lumber again. Why not 
simply a ladder? Then Steve remem- 
bered that the Remm weren’t built 
for ladders. 

Guards, after a short conference 
with Egral, conducted them via corri- 
dors and one elevator to the control 
room. Steve noticed that regular 



64 



IF 




ship’s lighting was on, which meant 
it had at least some power. 

Another guard opened a door, and 
they stepped into the central control 
room. There were extra keyboards, 
no doubt for instructional memory- 
banks, and whole panels of switches 
that probably controlled lecture 
rooms throughout the ship. 

The two guards remained; and 
Egral, squatting against the far bulk- 
head, said, “Somewhere in this maze, 
unless it’s been destroyed by battle- 
damage, is the basic theory, plus 
practical aspects, of the Gree null 
system.” 

V 

S teve, pretty sure by now that 
Egral understood no English, 
risked plain talk with Fazzool. “It 
doesn’t make sense. Their null sys- 
tem’s obviously superior, yet they’re 
desperate to learn Gree’s.” 

Fazzool made a face. “Zey are 
not idiots. Zere is zomezing in ze 
Gree system zey haven’t got. Well, 
what do we do?” 

“Go ahead and start betraying 
Gree, I suppose,” Steve said. “It 
breaks my heart.” He turned to the 
keyboard they were studying and 
punched byttons. 

But he punched a little aberration 
into the program. 

A rasp came from a small grille 
below a viewscreen, then an Over- 
seer voice. “Three-hop training 
voyage, using one isolated star, one 
cloud nebula at long range and one 
correlation of star-charts. Student 
must — ” The voice faded, came 
back for a moment, then was lost in 



a harsh rattle of electronic noise. 

Steve looked up at Egral. “I’ll 
have to search various alternate cir- 
cuits.” 

Under cover of that, he moved 
to the main navigating keyboard, ac- 
tivated it and punched for specific 
information. He demanded in^ Over- 
seer, “State of ship’s null apparatus 
and of ship’s grav drive^ Verbal reply 
only.” 

Back it came promptly: “Null on 
indefinite stand-by, as ordered by 
Commanding Officer just prior to 
ship’s disabling. Power leads to ac- 
cumulators deliberately sabotaged. 
Ship’s grav drive damaged; extent 
not known.” 

Steve didn’t risk more, but turned 
to Egral. “According to the Main 
Computer, various things are out of 
order, including the null apparatus. 
How did you get her here?” 

He hop^ to slip the question by, 
but Egral showed his teeth in a brief 
grin. “There is no reason I should 
not tell you. We used two of our 
own capital ships to form a null 
field big enough to englobe this 
ship.” 

Steve said nothing and pretended 
to search farther for damage. The 
technique Egral described was rou- 
tine. He asked questions of the com- 
puters and got answers. Gradually 
he built up a picture of the damage 
that existed, but there were important 
blank spots in the picture. Either he 
or Fazzool would have to get a 
chance to go over the ship. Then, 
given another shot at the control 
room, they might do many things. 

Suppose, instead of nulling away, 
they merely locked hatches so they 



THE SIGN OF GREE 



65 




were alone with Egral? Could they 
ovei^oome him? Not likely. Those 
teeth and claws, and those muscles, 
weren’t for nothing. Lock him in a 
separate compartment, then, and null 
Just a little ways; communicate; and, 
using Egral as a hostage, bargain? 
Bargaining wasn’t indicated yet. 
And at that moment Egral, a glint 
in his eyes, said, “Incidentally, we’ve 
removed certain things for study, so 
this ship isn’t in flying condition.” 
So much, then, for that scheme. 

I t took two long sessions for Steve 
to find the information Egral es- 
pecially wanted. It was a series of 
lectures, with diagrams and photos 
that could be flashed on screens in 
various classrooms, outlining the 
theory and practice of the Gree null 
science. No Slave, even a Drive 
Tech, would have access to this. 
Steve knew some of it, and he 
thought Egral was being naive to as- 
sume it could be absorbed quickly. 
He said so to Fazzool. 

“Well,” the B’lant said, “zat is so, 
if he expects to absorb it. But he did 
not say zat. He just said we are to 
translate it. Would it not be more 
logical for zem to take ze transla- 
tion somewhere for study?” 

“Yeah. I wonder . could you 
pretend to be looking for damage 
to the memory-banks and meanwhile 
find that deliberate break in the 
power-leads and fix it or be ready 
to?” 

“I can pretend, if zey give me ze 
chance.” 

Steve turned to the Remm who was 
on guard and said distinctly, “Egral.” 
The alien blinked, hesitated, then 



waved his pistol for them to precede 
him. 

Egral, when they found him, pon- 
dered the request. “All right. But 
there’s one of us here who’s been 
studying the circuitry. He’ll accom- 
pany Fazzool.” 

Fazzool showed no disappoint- 
ment. He said, “Fair enough,” and 
went with Egral while Steve was es- 
corted back to the control room. 

O stensibly working at the translif- 
tion, Steve had time to investi- 
gate the ship’s automatic and remote 
controls. He could, he decided 
(though he didn’t test it then) open 
or close all the hatches, turn lights 
on or off, adjust the air conditioning 
and do various other things from the 
control room. He decided to test the 
Remms’ tolerance by activating an 
outside viewer. 

The guard, squatting in a corner, 
was on his feet with a little snarl 
the instant the viewscreen came on. 
Steve, pretending casualness, swung 
the view, showing first the forest, 
then the clearing with the two air- 
cars in it. One of the big flying in- 
sects moved by close to the cam- 
era. The Remm guard sat down 
again. Steve added sound. 

Egral, when he came in, gave a 
little purr of surprise. “We thought 
they were inoperative! But why did 
you — ” 

Steve said apologetically, “Testing 
power leads; they’re an awful maze. 
Is there any objection?” 

Egral eyed him narrowly. “I think 
not. In fact, that viewer may be 
useful. Can you set it to watch the 
forest?” 



66 



IF 




“Why, yes.” And Steve did so. 

Egral was thoughtful for a mo- 
ment. “I must talk to someone.” 
With a glance at the guard, he left 
the room. 

Fazzool returned before the viewer 
showed night outside. “Oh! Zey. pre- 
mit zat?” 

Steve said, “I didn’t ask permis- 
sion first. But now they want the 
forest watched. Did you see any- 
thing that looked like sentries?” 

“I did indeed. Zere are squads on 
watch in ports on zat side, wiz 
searchlights ready.” 

Steve thought that over. “If there’s 
something they’re worried about, 
we’ll have to be ready ourselves. 
What about ship’s power?” 

“Zere are no broken leads zat can- 
not be repaired fairly easily, and ex- 
cept for grav drive and null, ze ship 
has power. But ze heavy converters 
are gone; cut out wiz torches. Zis 
tub will not fly.” 

“But there’s plenty of power for 
on-the-ground functions?” 

“Yes.” 

“How about weapons?” 

“None. But zere is various loose 
metal. We could make clubs or 
knives.” 

Steve couldn’t help grinning. “A 
hell, of a way to fight a space war. 
Well, I’ve done enough for today.” 
He gestured to the guard. 

N ow, in a ship’s compartment, 
they had real bunks and bed- 
ding. Steve lay in the dark, listening 
to Fazzool’s heavy breathing. Out- 
side the door, a guard’s claws oc- 
casionally clicked on steel decking. 
He wasn’t happy with the way 



things were going. It didn’t look as 
if he were going to get off the planet, 
or even see the Remm base here. 
And Egral was certainly suspicious. 
Maybe he even suspected the truth. 
Ad^tting knowledge of the Over- 
seer language had been an expedi- 
ent, and the more Steve thought 
about it, the less proud bf it he was. 
The Remm knew ordinary Slaves 
were carefully kept ignorant of that 
language. 

Wasn’t it logical then, from their 
viewpoint, to think Steve was some 
kind of special commando? By now 
they’d surely satisfied themselves 
that he was not of the Overseer race 
— close questioning of a Slave would 
take care of that. But why shouldn’t 
there be individual Slaves elevated 
to a higher service, secret from the 
other Slaves? And with that sus- 
picion, it was logical for the Remm 
to play along, pretending naivete, 
and perhaps concealing all sorts of 
resources Steve couldn’t imagine. 
Maybe they had their own view- 
screens somewhere in the ship, 
watching everything. 

Irritably, he kicked off his blank- 
ets and pounded the pillow to make 
it softer. What did he know about 
the Remm at all, except that they 
had two arms and four legs and 
some unfamiliar ships? 

Laboriously, he went over funda- 
mentals. One: the Remm were study- 
ing Gree war potential. Two: so far, 
their tactics had been only hit-and- 
run, to capture Slaves and equipment 
to study. Three: they hadn’t appear- 
ed, so far as Steve’s side could de- 
termine, anywhere but in this limited 
region, just within the edge of the 



THE SIGN OF GREE 



67 




Grce Empire. Four: their ships and 
at least some of their technology 
were radically different. 

It was tempting to conclude that 
they came from a long way off and 
that they’d had no previous contact 
with Gree. But a long way in what 
direction? Gree and Effogan scouts 
had explored, more or less, a sector 
of the galaxy amounting to about a 
tenth of the volume. It was supposed 
to be impossible to null much closer 
to the nave. And to go around much 
farther in either direction, and re- 
turn, would take a fair chunk of a 
humanoid’s lifespan unless one 
gambled very dangerously on long 
null-hops. 

But of course there were many 
dense star-clusters like this one; es- 
pecially here, on the nave- ward edge 
of the known sector. And if the 
Remm could navigate in this one 
safely, they could do so in others. 

And of course there was the nave 
itself — a grinding maelstrom of un- 
known forces, close-whirling multi- 
ple stars, gas clouds already coales- 
cing into new stars and general de- 
bris. Theory said it couldn’t be navi- 
gated. But theory had been wrong 
before. 

There wasn’t anything he knew to 
indicate, eidier, that the Remm did 
or did not plan war against the vast 
Gree Empire. If they did, they’d 
need a lot ipore than a few Task 
Forces using hit-and-run tactics. 
OoBOter-tac' ics could be worked out. 
NiiM disadvantage or no, the sheer 
bu& of the Empire was enough to 
give any strategist fits. 

Neither had he made any head- 
way in finding out whether the Remm 



— presuming, against all credibility, 
that could defeat the Empire — 
would ^emselves become a threat 
to the rest of the galaxy. Which left 

him right where he’d started. 

% 

VI 

A s fitful as his sleep was, he awoke 
with one idea. He discussed it 
with Fazzool over breakfast — 
which was meat and boiled grain 
again. “Did you have a chance to 
see whether the artificial gravity cir- 
cuits were okay?” ^ 

The B’lant, munching grain, eyed 
him questioningly. “I saw no dam- 
age. But ze most zat could be gen- 
erated in any part of a ship like zis 
would be less zan two G’s, anyway. 
If you’re zinking of trying zat against 
ze Remm, zey’d hardly notice it.” 
“No. But I can feed all sorts of 
things into the intercoms. And I 
can lock Egral in somewhere by re- 
mote control, maybe, and fake some- 
thing that would cause him to give 
the wrong orders. He couldn’t tell 
gravity from acceleration. I might 
even be able to fake a take-off. Or, 
I can fake the sound of weapons, 
I think.” He scowled at Fazzool’s 
faintly derisive look. “Damn it, I 
haven’t worked out anything definite 
yet. But a lot can be done by mis- 
leading people.” 

“People; yes. We do not know 
about zese beings. And assume ze 
best. Suppose you could get zem 
all lock^ up in ze ^ip, and we 
capture ze two aircars and some 
hand guns. Zen where do we go, eh? 
Back to ze valley? Or do we attack 
ze base ze two of us and capture a 



a 



IF 




ship we do not know how to fly?” 
Steve nodded gloomily. “Sure. I’m 
only thinking, really, of getting some 
kind of a bargaining position. If 
you’ve got any better ideas, let’s have 
them.” 

Fazzool shrugged, ate more meat 
and said, with pretended serious- 
ness, “Since you are ze colonel and 
I am only a new major, I have not 
given it much zought.” 

Steve snarled and pushed his own 
plate away. 

Nevertheless, to be ready for any 
break, he continued familiarizing 
himself with ^ the ship’s controls, 
meanwhile going on with his trans- 
lation. 

On the fourth day, another air- 
car arrived, bringing about a dozen 
nu>re Remm. At least two of them 
were older than Egral, but neither 
seemed to be his military superior. 
Shortly the aircar took off again, 
taking several of the Remm who’d 
been here before. Simply rotation of 
duty, maybe. 

Later in the day Egral asked Steve, 
“Can you arrange some way to trans- 
fer what you’ve done so far into a 
portable memory bank?” 

Steve asked, “In what form?” 
“Why, in spoken B’lant.” 

Steve, puzzled, asked, “if it’s por- 
table, it can be brought into the con- 
trol room, can’t it? And we can just 
play the stuff into it. Or doesn’t it 
have a sound pickup?” 

Egral blinked. “Of course it has. 
That was stupid of me.” Then he 
said, “One of the group who arrived 
today thinks you’ve only been trans- 
lating superficial theory so far.” 
Steve lied, “I’m taldng it as it 



comes. And I’m no Diive icch, re- 
member.” 

“Nevertheless,” Egral said ,“we 
believe you can do better. If y«u 
don’t, we will apply presure,^ 

“Such as what?” 

Egral’s brief smile showd. “For 
a start, feeding you more grain and 
less meat. I notice you do not Mke 
the grain much, though it is sup- 
posed to be good for -you.” 

Steve nearly cursed him, but then 
he had to grin. “I’U hurry it all I 
can.” 

The incident didn’t bother him; 
it was only a first admonition. And 
it convinc^ him finally that Egral 
himself knew very little null tech- 
nology. 

N ow he dipped into lore that 
quickened his interest: the 

means by which two null-points, of 
approximately known location but 
shifting, could be linked by some 
sort of beacon or track. That was 
done all the time; when, for instance, 
a ship hopped into a null-tank, with- 
in an atmosphere or somewhere else 
where there was too much matter to 
allow spacing-in. You evacuated a 
large, strong steel tank to near vacu- 
um, formed the link and nulled the 
ship into the tank. But what he 
hadn’t known was that an actual 
beam of some force, only empirically 
known and operating in null without 
time-lag, was generated from both 
ends and, once joined, maintained its 
connection automatically. 

The Overseer who’d recorded 
this lecture went into considerable 
speculation of whether the beam 
formed a straight line (assuming 



THE SIGN OF GREE 



69 




there was such a thing in null as a 
straight line) or whether it followed 
some sort of curve as a result of 
divergent aiming. In any case, it 
seemed to Steve that the technique 
might hint at how the Remm 
achieved their instant null, without 
waiting to recharge. If forces suffici- 
ent to guide a ship could be sent 
through null, why not accumulated 
energy? 

If it did relate to their system, he 
wouldn’t be giving them anything 
new. He translated that lecture, which 
took him over twenty hours, and 
started on another. He was working 
in four-hour shifts now, with breaks 
in each for lunch, which left him 
nearly seven hours off per planetary 
rotation. Egral seemed happy with 
what he was doing now. 

It was two nights after he’d fin- 
ished the long translation that some 
noise wrenched him from his sleep. 

H e was up and slapping at his hip 
by reflex for a weapon that 
wasn’t there, then groping for boots 
and jamming his feet into them. Faz- 
zool was a step faster getting to the 
door. Some kind of a fight was going 
on behind it. He touched Fazzool on 
the shoulder and stood aside as the 
B’lant jerked it open. 

The fight was apparently over. 
Two vaguely humanoid shapes were 
rounding a turn in the corridor. On 
the deck, the Remm guard was 
sprawled, legs moving spasmodically. 
One blunt hand clutched a giant ar- 
row — rather, a feathered spear — 
that he’d apparently just pulled from 
a wound in his neck. Blood from 
that and other wounds spread on 



the steel. Another spear, broken, 
lay not far away. Steve darted a 
look around, saw the Guard’s energy- 
pistol where it had fallen and jump- 
ed to scoop it up. The Remm con- 
vulsed once more and lay still. Steve 
snapped, “Control room!” to Faz- 
zool and ran that way. 

They turned into a well lit cor- 
ridor and came face-to-face with sev- 
eral of the attackers. 

They were not men, nor. human- 
oids. 

There were two legs, two arms, a 
neck and head. But the limbs were 
slender, almost spidery; the torso 
very spare, only inches thick from 
front to back except for the thorax, 
where leathery skin stretched over 
thin ribs. The head was smaller than 
a man’s, with oval, sharp-tipped ears 
and a bestial face with a muzzle and 
fangs like a dog. 

An instant, and the creature’s arm 
shot up to hurl one of the feathered 
spears. Steve saw now that a great 
membrane — he’d taken it at first 
for a cloak — stretched from wrist 
to ankle, like the patagium of some 
gliding mammal. He jerked up the 
pistol and fired. The creature 
screamed in pain. The spear went 
askew; but half a dozen others were 
poised. 

Steve was already whirling, as 
Fazzool paused to throw his own 
captured spear. The shafts whished 
around them as they fan back the 
way they’d come, awkwardly in the 
light gravity. A sharp pain struck at 
Steve’s shoulder blade, but the spear 
bounced off the bone. He heard Faz- 
zool grunt and hoped the thick 
B’lant skin had turned a shaft or at 



70 



IF 




least partly stopped it. They reached 
the side corridor, and he skidded to 
a stop, leaned back to rake the well 
lighted one with the energy beam. 
The creatures’ shouts went up in 
pitch, and they fought to retreat. He 
didn’t wait to kill more of them, but 
gestured Fazzool on. There were 
roars from all directions now, as if 
the ship were full of the things. He 
scanned closed doorways in the cor- 
ridor, chose one, gulped a breath of 
relief that it was the right one. A 
ladder led down into an unlit well. 
He started down, heard Fazzool 
slam the door behind them and fol- 
low. Four levels down, by feel, he 
opened a door cautiously and step- 
ped out into a pitch-black corridor, 
groping his way along it. He made 
a turn, and another, came up against 
a dead end and had to retrace. Fi- 
nally he found the verticle shaft he 
wanted. The ladder was easy climb- 
ing in the half-gravity, but his shoul- 
der hurt He hoped Fazzool wasn’t 
any worse off. 

He counted levels, muttered a 
word of warning to the B’lant and 
stepped onto a platform to put his 
ear to a metal door. There were 
faint sounds behind it. Damn! Then 
,he recognized that they were only 
the outside s^ound pickup, still turn- 
ed on. Pistol ready, he threw open 
the door. 

The control room was lit but un- 
occupied. Hurriedly he went around 
locking doors, Fazzool helping. 
Finally he ordered the B’lant, “Hold 
still,” and stepped behind him. 
Blood was seeping through the leath- 
er jerkin in two places, but not much. 
Relieved, he said, “Guess you’ll do. 



Now, if we can manage a few tricks 
from here, we’ll go get those two 
aircars, as you suggested.” 

“/ suggested?” the B’lant said. “1 
was only making talk. What good 
are ze ^cars to us?” 

“If we get them, we’ve got the 
Remm here isolated, at least for 
several hours. I’m almost sure they 
don’t have a transmitter except in 
the aircars, and I’m going to make 
sure right now.” He went to a com- 
munications panel and began keying 
different rooms. “Egral?” He tried 
another. “Egral?” 

I t took ten minutes to get a reply. 

It came, the panel light indicated, 
from a large compartment with sev- 
eral outside ports, which must have 
been an instruction room. Indicators 
showed the ports as closed and lock- 
ed; the doors also. “Jen? Where — 
you must be in the control room! 
How did you get there? It was cut 
off!” 

“Ladders,” Steve said. “We’re 
adapted to climbing, remember. Our 
guard is dead. How about the rest 
of you?” 

Egral said, “Out of about thirty- 
five, six known dead. Seveti, count- 
ing your guard. Two or three badly 
hurt; others with minor wounds. A 
small group is somewhere in the far 
end of the ship, but safe, we think, 
as they are still operating their 
searchlight. Maybe you can connect 
us with them. The rest of us are 
safe here for the time. We thought 
we’d wait for morning. But now, of 
course, you can light the whole ship, 
and we can start clearing it out.” 
“Well,” Steve lied, “the power’s

they actually fly? How many in-

sounded impodeot. “Don't 
forget, your safety depends on ours. 
They can fly for short distances, or 
soar in a wind. We’ve only had 
skirmishes with small bands before, 
so we’ve never bothered to teach 
them a real lesson. Perhaps we 
should have. We think there must 
be several hundred aboard. We were 
foolish enough to let a few land un- 
seen from directly overhead. They 
showed a surprising organization, 
seized several open ports and held 
them while others poured in from 
the trees. Is Fazzool with you? Are 
you both unhurt?” 

“Both here, nicked, but not dan- 
gerously.” Steve saw from panel 
lights that Egral’s compartment was 
dark. To pretend allegiance Steve 
turned on lights in it. “Is that better? 
Have you radioed for help?” 

“No,” Egral said, “we — ” He 
broke off. 

Steve gave Fazzool a look and 
turned off the communicator for a 
moment. “These Remm aren't on top 
of the situation.” 

Fazzool shook his head. “I knew 
zat when we saw ze guard, dead from 
somezing so primitive as a spear. 
But what zen?” 

Steve keyed the intercom again. 
“I’ll investigate the ship’s radio 
equipment, Egral. If it’s working, 
maybe I can give you a voice cir- 
cuit so you can call your base. Wait.” 

H e could, of course, do that in 
moments. Instead, he went to 
one of the teaching-banks’ key- 



boards, chose a lecture, programmed 
it to play in various part of the ship, 
pundbyed for loud volume and set it 
going. Noise blared outside the lock- 
ed doors. That would distract the 
gliding creatures for a while — and 
also cover up the sounds of certain 
doors and hatches opening, to clear 
a path to ground level. Quickly, he 
turned on outside cameras and 
swivelled them around, increasing 
intensity to see in the starlight. On 
the forest side, a searchlight swept 
across a gliding figure, which twisted 
and dove, evading the energy beam 
that spat out from a hand gun. In 
the other direction the two aircars 
were dark, with no sign of action 
around them. 

Egral’s voice was calling angrily. 
Steve turned off the noise long 
enough to talk. “I heard them outside 
doing something, and 1 wanted to 
worry them and gain ‘ ne. Say, we’ve 
just had an idea. I'a/zool says there’s 
power enough for artificial gravity 
for a few minutes. Would it help if 
I made gravity throughout the ship 
about four times what it is now?” 

There was a silence. Then Egral 
said, “I think you know that it would 
immobilize them without bothering 
us. Just what is in your mind, Jen? 
I remind you once more that you are 
alone, weaponless, on a strange plan- 
et in a part of the galaxy the loca- 
tion of which you don’t know.” 

That, Steve mused, was EgraVs 
bargaining position, and it was a 
good one. Still — 

Suddenly he stared at Fazzool. Of 
course! ^^y hadn’t it occurred to 
him? He turned back to the inter- 
com. “True,” he said to Egral. “We’re 



72 



IF 




as lost as you are, until we get back 
to where you captured us.” 

It was a gamble, of course. 

A minute passed, silently. Fazzool 
began to grin. Steve told Egral, “I’m 
going to start the gravity, but you’d 
better stay put until we go down 
ladders and check the power supply. 
It will take us a while. We won’t be 
able to climb back up in the gravity, 
but I’ll arrange so we can talk to you 
from there.” 

He turned on the loud lecture 
again, then swiftly programmed the 
artificial gravity and punched the 
“Execute” button. 

Fazzool, braced, growled, “It does 
not work!” 

Steve pointed to lights on a panel. 
“Sure it does. You didn’t think I’d 
include this room or our path to 
the outside, did you?” 

VII 

A s fast as they could in the dark, 
they went down ladders and 
along passageways to a port low on 
the curve of the middle section. 
Around them, the ship resounded 
with the programmed lecture. Steve 
peered out at the starlit clearing, 
saw nothing. > 

The nearer of the aircars was fifty 
or sixty » yards away. Once there, 
they’d fly it to the other. He dropped 
the thirty feet or so to the ground, 
rolled to absorb the impact and was 
on his feet, running, with a glance 
to make sure Fazzool got down all 
right. He tried to watch the footing 
and look up and behind at the same 
time. A dark shape came diving. He 
hurled himself aside as a spear 



zipped into the ground, raked a pis- 
tol-beam across the creature lo be 
sure of a hit. It screamed «nd 
swerved to flee. Other dim shapes 
were swooping from atop the ship, 
releasing their spears from a safer 
distance. The spears plunked m a 
scattered patter; there was no use 
dodging. Then they were at the flyer, 
and Skeve, his back pressed against 
it, sent short squirts of energy up to 
discourage the attackers. Fazzool 
fumbled the hatch open, and they 
scrambled into the pilot’s compart- 
ment Steve felt about the unfamiliar 
panel for light-studs, swore and play- 
ed the laser gun for an instant on 
the steel ceiling. The momentary 
glow was enough. He jabbed at but- 
tons and lights came on. 

Then it was only a matter of guess- 
work and experimentation to get the 
craft in the air. He spent a minute 
checking controls, then moved 
toward the second aircar, maneuver- 
ed carefully, and hovered while Faz- 
zool leaped out and got into the 
second vehicle. Then Steve lifted a 
ways and made a dash at a flock 
of the gliding creatures, who, flap- 
ping hard, were hovering nearby. 
They scattered and dove like spar- 
rows before a hawk. 

Now there was time to study the 
radio transmitter and make sure he 
only used enough power to peach 
Egral. The booming lecture was still 
going; he’d been a little generous 
guessing how long they’d need to 
get to the aircars. When it stopped 
he tried channels until Egral’s voice 
answered. “Jen? Where :ire you? Will 
the gravity stay on?” 

“No,” Steve told him, “it’ll go off

any minute now. I programmed it 
tiiat way. And there are a lot of 
those vermin outside, anxious to get 
into (the ship.** 

A long pause. Then, in a snarl, 
“Where are you?** 

“In the two aircars. We want to 
bargain.** 

E gral said in a flat tone, “I sup- 
pose you’re some kind of special 
commando. If I hadn’t been dealing 
with the Slaves, I wouldn’t have 
underestimated you so badly. As it 
is, you were very lucky in having 
this thing come up.” 

“Of course,” Steve said, “but give 
us credit for being ready, anyway.” 
“I’ll give you nothing. We’ll blow 
up this whole planet before we sur- 
render.” 

“Surrender, hell,” Steve said, “we 
want to pool resources with you. 
Especially technology! Fazzool and 
I aren’t with Gree. We represent a 
coalition that’s resisting him, and 
we can’t conceivably be a threat to 
your home region, wherever it is. We 
aren’t conquest-minded, anyway. 
We’ve tried before to make contact 
with you, but you shot without wait- 
ing to listen.** 

Another pause, then Egral said, a 
little uncertainly, “The gravity just 
went off.” He didn’t know it, of 
course, but that was only in his 
compartment, to fool him. “If we 
shot without provocation, we are not 
aware of it.” 

“I’ll accept that,” Steve said, 
“since I realize your position, sur- 
rounded by hostiles, isolated and 
lost. Anyway, our ships look like 
Gree’s. They may even have been 



wearing the Sign, since they had 
to sneak so deep into Gree terri- 
tory. What I propose is this: you and 
I sit and trade questions, one at a 
time, in turn. We both agree to 
answer them frankly. As a guarantee 
of our own sincerity, we’ll rescue you 
from the vermin, give up all our ad- 
vantage and place ourselves in your 
hands agkin. We don’t have to, you 
know. We have other resources.” 
Which was a pretty splendid lie. 

Egral said cautiously, “You don’t 
know much about us. 'You wouldn’t 
bargain if you had other resources.” 
Steve said, “I know with reason- 
able certainty that you’re not pirates 
or tyrants. You’re not nearly ruthless 
enough. And I’ll rely on your word.” 
Another wait, then Egral made a 
sound like a sigh. “All right; I give 
it. But I’ll be skinned alive for talk- 
ing to you direct.” 

Steve said, “We’re in the same 
boat. But this is the best way.” He 
looked toward the other aircar and 
saw, as he expected, Fazzool’s face 
glaring at him. 

F azzool wasted a question by ask- 
ing about the planet. “It’s disk- 
shaped,” Egral told them, “less than 
fifteen per cent as thick through the 
poles as its longest diameter, which 
is close to thirty thousand miles.” 
He caught Steve’s look of doubt. 
“No. As you realize, a core of nor- 
mal matter couldn’t assume that 
shape without spinning much faster, 
and then it would be unstable. But 
this isn’t what you call normal mat- 
ter. It’s a small core, of much denser 
matter than any you consider nor- 
mal, which has the property that. 



74 



IF 




when a mass of it rotate .. Us gravity 
is polarized along the axis of spin. 
Not entirely, but to an extent de- 
pending on the rate of spin. That’s 
why the gravity in that prison valley’s 
bigber. Out here, besides being off 
the center line of polarization, we’re 
much farther from the core. I’ve 
often wished I had time to fly out 
farther, near the rim; things might 
be interesting there. My question: 
Where is this Effogan coalition you 
represent?” 

Steve told him, “Out beyond the 
Gree Empire. We’re mostly in one 
spiral arm of the galaxy. Now, my 
question: why is such a competent 
fighting force as yours so lacking in 
technicians, or even artisans?” 

Egral shifted his body weight. 
“That’s a longer story. We were on 
a long cruise. We do have enemies, 
as you’ve doubtless concluded. Then, 
forced into a sudden maneuver, we 
made a hastily computed null jump. 
It just happened to land us in some 
nexus of force that I can’t begin to 
explain. Without insisting on a ques- 
tion, m tell you that our home is 
closer to the galactic nave, where 
there are forces that baffle our best 
theoreticians. In an^^ case, our par- 
ticular group of the Force was 
hurled thousands of light-years into 
totally unfamiliar surroundings. 
We’ve never been this far out before 
— we didn’t even know the galaxy 
had spiral arms! Well, this particular 
cluster here attracted us somehow, 
or brought us out of null or whatever 
we were travelling in. It seems this 
is a localized concentration of the 
denser matter I described, and which 
we’re used to; that’s probably what 



brought us out of null. But I digress. 
We were without any of our auxiliary 
ships, which bore the technicians — 
we had nothing, almost, but fighting 
personnel. Though I, myself, am a 
linguist by specialty.” He paused. 
“You see, with us, the females are 
the technicians, and they dom’t go 
into actual battle on fighting slyps. 
My question — oh, nonsease; I 
don’t have any worth bothering with. 
What do you want to know?” 
“Well,” Steve said, “if our icsen- 
tists, who are as good or better tian 
Gree’s, are going to help you get 
home, they’ll have to know about 
your null technique.” 

“Oh, that. Tm not too well versed 
in it myself. But in our capital ships, 
which do the nulling with the small- 
er ones inside, a great store of en- 
ergy is left in null, so that it doesn’t 
have to be built up slowly in normal 
space. That’s why we have the dou- 
ble-globe shape; one’s left m null, 
connected by bonds of force as well 
as matter, and it holds the necessary 
energy. The only reason it’s visible 
at all is that there’s a minor energy- 
leak into space. I notice our trick 
of opening a hull wherever we wish 
amazes you. It’s very simpk. We 
simply null a section of the metal, 
then return it whenever we wish.” 

S teve said, “TechnologicaDy, I 
think our side will get the better 
of this bargain.” 

“Maybe,” Egral said, “but there 
are things we lack too. Knowkdge 
of the outer galaxy . And of 
course, lius Group has little' to offer 
except the ehips, for study. Once we 
were in contact with the Grcc forces

IF 




— they attacked without warning, by 
the way, when we were only explor- 
ing peacefully — we hoped we could 
capture scientists and learn enough 
from them to find our way home. 
But frankly, things were getting des- 
perate. We’d learned almost nothing. 
We haven’t the basic training we 
need anyway. And we’re running 



short of munitions, not to mention 
fuel.” 

Fazzool said, “Zat will be quickly 
remedied once we get to an Effogan 
base.” He added thoughtfully, “I 
have always wondered what ze nave 
of ze galaxy would be like. Perhaps 
I will add one term to ze deal: you 
take us zere!” END

A Code For Sam 

by LESTER del REY 

Illustrated by LUTJENS 



Ouf at the end of the spaceways, 
humans and robots fought side by 
side to win new worlds for Earth! 



I 

I t was hours after the cave-in be- 
fore the first sounds of rescue 
reached Sam. He switched his brain 
back to high amperage drain to 
come fully -alert and began sending 
more current through his body heat- 
ers to prepare for emergence. From 
the nearness of the digging, there 
could be only a few feet of rubble 
left in the collapsed tunnel. 

Fifteen minutes later, he felt a 
pick strike near his outstretched 



hand. He grabbed it and pulled him- 
self out of the dirt and gravel around 
him, then scrambled quickly forward 
to the entrance. Surprisingly, it was 
a human hand that reached out to 
help him to his feet. 

“You okay, Sam?” Barney Collins 
asked. The wizened old prospector’s 
face and oxygen mask were filthy 
with sweat and dust, but concern 
showed plainly in his eyes. 

Sam nodded. “I’m fine, Barney. 
What happened to Pete?” 

“The new robot?” Barney shoved 



78 





his mask aside and spat out tobacco 
juice, then shrugged. “Something 
funny about him. Came into camp 
hours ago, but never said a word 
about you till we got worried and 
asked. Come on, we better get back 
to the digger before it gets colder.” 

Sam glanced about, to see that 
the day was almost done. The high 
ceremonial mounds were casting long 
shadows as Tau Ceti sank in the 
east, and the thin air was already 
losing heat. In another hour, the 
temperature would be forty below 
zero. At its best, Anubis was a hos- 
tile world even to a robot like Sam, 
totally unlike the lovely second plan- 
et men called Isis. Here, except for 
the Gregg Archeological Expedition, 
there were only a few prospectors 
and trappers, with a small spaceport 
and trading post at Ramses to ser- 
vice them. 

Their digger was a converted 
prospector tank with a larger cabin 
and a collapsible shovel crane on 
top. Inside, Barney threw off his 
mask and began washing it hastily, 
while Sam lifted his chestplate and 
switched to freshly charged batteries. 
The man turned on the headlight, 
then swung -the vehicle on its 
caterpillar treads to head back toward 
the camp, some four miles away. 

“A lot of" trolls showing up,” he 
muttered. “Too blamed many.” 

A dozen natives could be seen in 
the headlight beams as he 
spoke, moving aside to let the digger 
pass. Their snarling, vulpine faces 
stared fixedly at the machine. They 
stood three feet high, with bodies 
like pears mounted on pipestem legs 



and with arms that nearly touched 
the ground. A greenish fur stood 
out several inches as insulation 
against the cold. All were armed 
with spears and heavy stone ham- 
mers, and some had bows slung 
over their backs. There were no 
young among them. 

Sam shared none of Barney’s" pre- 
judice against the trolls, but he felt 
a growing unease as they passed an- 
other armed group. In the years he 
had worked with Gregg to untangle 
the lost past of Anubis, he had en- 
countered no real threat from them. 
But their sullen legends were full of 
violence, and most of it centered 
here at the Burial Mounds of the 
Rock Devils where the expedition 
was digging. 

The men were just sitting down 
to eat as they entered the main ex- 
pedition Quonset. Barney took his 
seat between the gray form of James 
Gregg and the heavy figure of his 
former prospecting partner, Yeng 
Lee. Across the table, young Dick- 
son sat alone. He had joined them 
with the PT model robot two days 
before, unasked but bearing authori- 
zation from the Earth university 
that was funding them. The space 
he’d taken in the supply truck hadn’t 
made him any more welcome. And 
now his face was flushed with heat 
from some argument that had been 
going on before Sam arrived. 

Gregg motioned for Sam to take 
one of the chairs. “All right, now 
maybe we’ll get some sense out of 
it. Sam, what happened to you? 
Dickson here won’t let me question 
Pete properly.” 

“I have every authority to retain 



A CODE FOR SAM

full control over Pete, as you know, 
Dr. Gregg,” Dickson said in a tone 
he tried to keep patient. He had 
moved away slightly as Sam dropped 
beside him, a gesture that betrayed 
his Earth origin even more than his 
accent. “Pete is an important experi- 
mental model. I cannot let him be 
ruined by improper handling.” 

Sam broke in quickly to tell what 
he could, but he wasn’t entirely sure 
himself! He’d been digging a tunnel 
into the core of a new mound after 
instructing Pete in the placement of 
temporary shoring. There had been 
the sound of strain on one section, 
and he’d yelled for Pete to get under 
it and support it until new bracing 
could be added. Then the whole 
roof came down, trapping him. 

“The cave-in may have started 
before Pete could reach it,” Sam 
finished. He didn’t believe it, but 
his back had been turned at the 
time. “But Jim, I — ” 

Gregg interrupted impatiently. 
“All right, we’ll let that go. But 1 
want to know why he abandoned 
you there and then didn’t report 
when he got back! Well, Dr. Dick- 
son?” 

“I won’t even discuss it before 
another robot,” Dickson said. 

Gregg’s fist hit the table with a 
blow that made the dishes jump. 
“By Horus, Dickson, one more 
crack like that and you’ll be walking 
back to Ramses, fund or no fund! 
Sam’s my second in command here, 
as well as a friend of mine. Pete, 
come out here!” 

“Easy, Jim,” Barney said quietly. 
“The kid’s from Earth and doesn’t 
know any better. Give him time.” 



Gregg’s face lost some of its tense- 
ness. He fumbled in his pocket 
and dragged out a cigarette^ lapping 
it sharply against the table. He was 
just lighting it when Pete ennerged 
from the kitchen. 

Then the new robot waa across 
the main room at a single and 
his fingers were tearing the eigarette 
out of Gregg’s mouth. He dropped 
it onto the packed dirt Hoor and 
ground it out with his heoL 
“Cigarettes are harmful to human 
beings. Master,” he said in hie gentle, 
monotonous voice. 

U 

D ickson had jumped to hk feet 
and covered the robot’s body 
with his own before Gregg could 
push up from the chair. Now he be- 
gan shoving Pete from tho room, 
saying something in words loo low 
for the others to hear. Then he was 
back, looking acutely embarrassed. 

“I’m sorry — very sorry. He 
won’t do that again. I’ve lold him 
that cigarettes are only harmful on 
Earth — quite healthful here.” He 
sighed and groped backwards for 
his chair. “I — I guess I’d better 
explain, even though it may con- 
taminate our experiment.” 

Gregg look a long time lighting 
another cigarette. Finally he nodded 
stiffly. “Yes, Dr. Dickson, I think 
perhaps you’d better.” 

Dickson began awkwardly with 
needless background and too much 
bias. Robots were produced by Earth 
companies and leased from them, but 
nearly all were used in space, where 
they could cope with hostile environ- 



80 



IF 




ments better than men. As a result, 
most Earthmen had never seen a 
robot, and inexperience left them 
prey to every fantasy from the anci- 
ent horror films. And, of course, 
occasionally a robot did injure a 
human, with sensational headlines 
in all Earth newspapers. 

“So we had to make robots safe 
for Earth,” Dickson went on. “To 
do that, we had to devise a fool- 
proof code of ethics for them.” 

“Maybe you’d better find a de- 
cent code of ethics for humans and 
use that,” Barney suggested, 

Dickson smiled dutifully. “It 
wouldn’t work. Men’s ethics revolve 
around instinctual social drives; but 
robot brains contain only what is 
put into them during their educa- 
tion programs. Hence we must have 
precise rules that can be completely 
conditioned into them. Fortunately, 
I was able to discover such laws 
in the same literature which enabled 
Dr. Sorrenson to discover, our faster- 
than-light drive.” 

They might have guessed it. After 
Sorrenson invented the space drive 
and publicly admitted he’d taken the 
idea from an old science-fiction 
story, a lot of the borderline sci- 
ences had leaped onto the band- 
wagon. NoJx)dy had yet found any- 
thing else useful, but it was a good 
way to get research money now, 

ii/^ood Lord!” The anger on 
Gregg’s face had been re- 
placed by a growing amazement. 
“The three laws of the Asenion ro- 
bots! I read about them up in my 
grandfather’s attic when I was a kid. 
Don’t tell me you took those plot 



tricks seriously?” He closed his eyes, 
trying to remember. “A robot must 
not inflict or permit harm to a hu- 
man; subject to that law, a robot 
must obey human orders; and sub- 
ject to both laws, a robot must^ pro- 
tect itself. Right?” 

“Not precisely. But in general — ” 

“Slavery and racism!” Le6 spat 
the words out. “A black slave must 
not strike a white master; a black 
slave must obey a white master’s 
orders; a black slave must protect it- 
self as part of its white master’s 
property. You call that ethicsT 

“I don’t think the author meant 
them that way, Lee. They were just 
things he could build plots on, for 
fun,” Gregg said. 

The big man grimaced. “Fun! I 
suppose having Pete call every hu- 
man Master is an Earthman’s idea of 
fun, too?” 

“Unfortunately, it probably is.” 
Gregg turned back to Dickson, and 
his face was completely sober. “Na- 
turally, you had to train Pete to be 
as literal minded as most of the fic- 
tional robots. Any flexibility or judg- 
ment would have ruined your pre- 
cious code. Poor Pete! Without hu- 
man orders, he had to run away 
from any danger in the tunnel to 
protect himself. The robot Sam 
meant nothing in his code. And then, 
because he probably knew he’d done 
something wrong, he had to protect 
himself further by making no report 
until ordered to do so. Give him a 
month of normal work in conflict 
with your code, and Pete’s going to 
be hopelessly insane — maybe dan- 
g^ously so. Dr. Dickson, your ex- 
periment’s finished. Until you can

leave, you’ll keep Pete under close 
supervision, confined to the kitch- 
en.” 

“No!” Sam put a heavy hand on 
Dickson’s shoulder and shoved the 
whit^faced man back into his chair 
before angry words could spill from 
his lips. “No, I’m going to need Pete 
in the new tunnel tomorrow. And 
I’ll need Dr. Dickson to make him 
obey my orders.” 

Gregg shook his head, “Impossi- 
ble. Sam, you don’t know what 
you’d be letting yourself in for.” 
“Then I’ll have to risk it. No, 
wait. You were all so busy arguing 
about Pete’s ethics that I never got 
a chance to finish my report. Jim, 
this isn’t like the tunnels we’ve dug 
through all the other mounds. 
It’s ** 

“King Tut’s Tomb!” 

Sam nodded. “Maybe. At least 
I’ve struck against some kind of a 
metal barrier less than half way 
through the mound.” 

Then the men were clustering 
around him, pounding him on the 
back and yelling for the few details 
he could give. Even Dickson began 
to catch the feeling, though his eyes 
kept darting back to the metal hand 
that had rested so rudely on his 
shoulder. 

Later, when the men had finally 
retired to their bunks, Sam had 
time to let the contagion of their 
enthusiasm drain away and to get 
back to his private doubts. He moved 
out into the freezing night, staring 
at the ring of eyes around the Quon- 
set The trolls were still gathering 
here, armed and waiting. As he 
watched, a new group moved up and 



found places to huddle, only few 
hundred yards from the camp. 

Fifteen years, he thought as he 
went back into the dim main room. 
Long years while Gregg and he 
tracked down tiny bits of evidence 
that seemed to indicate the trolls 
had somehow reached a brief period 
of high culture a thousand years 
before. A worn bit of metal knife 
blade; a chipped burning glass that 
still worked; the divergent legends 
of the Killing of the Rock Devil 
and the yearly ceremony of mound 
building. And then the final discov- 
ery. 

Lee and Barney, returning from 
prospecting, had found a battered 
metal object sticking out of one 
mound. They hadn’t considered it 
important enough to mark the 
mound, but they’d taken it to Gregg 
at Ram. When finally opened, it con- 
tained nearly two hundred well pre- 
served sheets of paperlike material 
covered with writing. 

Sam took out a set of photocopies 
and glanced through it. A primitive 
language changes slowly, and the 
decoded writing was a phonetic 
script for early troll speech. He 
could read most of it now without 
Gregg’s dictionary or notes. But he 
couldn’t accept it. 

Without leaving evidence of a 
technology capable of building huge

write a simplified text on astronomy

and the evolution of stars? How 
could could such a culture refine and 
alloy aluminum and then roll it out 
to make the flat sheet that formed 
a barrier in the tunnel?

IF 




If the ancestors of the trolls had 
achieved all that once, who could 
hope to guess what they might do 
now? 

On impulse, Sam carried the pho- 
tocopy back into the kitchen where 
Pete was still sitting. There was time 
enough before morning for a PT 
robot to master Old Trollish, and the 
ability might prove useful later. At 
least it would fill Pete’s time better 
than brooding about his code of 
ethics. 

Ill 

I n the morning, the trolls seemed 
to have filled the whole area. 
They made no hostile move as the 
expedition party began unloading 
the digger and carrying shoring sup- 
plies. up to the tunnel, but hundreds 
of eyes followed every move. 

Gregg had been conferring with 
a couple of old trolls he had recog- 
nized, but now that conference seem- 
ed to be over. He was staring into the 
tunnel mouth cautiously as Sam and 
Pete climbed up to it with a load 
of shoring. He slipped the flashlight 
off its liook and began crawling 
forward, obviously trying to catch a 
glimpse of the other end. Pete watch- 
ed intently until the man was nearly 
inside the entrance. Then he dropped 
the last of his load and dashed for- 
ward to drag Gregg back. 

“You might be hurt. Master. It 
isn’t safe in there,” he warned the 
man gently. 

Surprisingly, Gregg grinned slight- 
ly. “Oh hell, maybe you’re right this 
time, Pete. Go back to work, and I’ll 
behave.” 



He waited until he was alone with 
Sam and then gestured toward the 
tunnel. “You’re going to need a lot 
more material than we brought to 
shore that up safely. The whole 
mound above it looks unstable. 
Think you can make out all right 
while we pull material out of Lee’s 
last dig?” 

“I think so,” Sam told him. “So 
far, Dickson’s lecture to Pete about 
following my orders seems to work. 
What about the trolls?” 

“They’ve been hearing rumors 
that we’re trying to bring the Rock 
Devil back to life, near as I can 
make out. I’ve told them we just 
want to make sure he’s still dead 
and really kill him if not. They seem 
willing to accept that, but they’re 
going to stick around to make sure.” 
He shrugged. “Maybe I’d better 
leave Dickson with you and Pete. 
He’s not much good for work, any- 
how.” 

He slipped over the edge and slid 
to the surface below. A few minutes 
later, the digger took off, drawing 
a small contingent of trolls after it. 
Most stayed on, keeping their gaze 
fixed on Dickson and the robot. 

There wasn’t much Dickson could 
do. He found a broad rock near the 
supplies and sat watching as Sam 
and Pete drew on their grappling 
mittens and heaved and pulled the 
heavy sections of wire mesh up to 
the ledge in front of the tunnel. 
Finally the work of hauling was fin- 
ished. 

“You go first, Pete,” Sam ordered. 
“I’ll back you up.” 

Pete considered the tunnel and 
began drawing back from it. “I

can't Yesterday proved that it's too 
dangerous in there.” 

Dickson was running toward them, 
and Pete would follow his orders, of 
course; the second law took pre- 
cedence over the third. But Sam had 
taken enough nonsense. He couldn't 
depend on calling Dickson to int^- 
cede if an accident happened in the 
tunnd. 

H e stepped forward, brushing 
Pete’s hesitant arms aside with 
a savage thrust. His grappling mit- 
tens closed firmly over the robot's 
nedc, and he began forcing the claws 
of the miftens together. 

“You’re in more danger now than 
you would be in the tunnel,” he 
told Pete. “You’ll have every wire 
in your neck sh<Mt-circuited, unless 
you make up your mind to obey my 
orders from now on.” 

Pete's head bobbed as far as it 
would go. “Yes, Master.” 

‘Tm not your mastw. I’m just 
Sam.” 

“Yes, Sam. I’ll go in the tunnel 
and do what you order.” 

“Sam, stop it!” Dickson was 
screaming and struggling to break 
Sam’s grip. “Release him at once, 
Sam. That’s an order!” 

Sam let his grip loosen and shov- 
ed the man aside. “You’d better get 
hack below. Dr. Dickson. I don’t 
have a second law — maybe not 
even a first one. If I’ve got any code 
at 1^, you wouldn’t know it — be- 
cause it wouldn’t occur to you to 
ask a normal robot about such things 
as ethics, would it?” 

The brief flush of fright was fad- 
ing from Dickson’s face, to be re- 



placed hf a thin smile. “No,” he 
admitted. *Tt really didn’t occur to 
me. Pechaps 1 should ask you, some 
time when we’re both not so busy. 
I’m sure you’d have an interesting 
answer.” 

Enlarging and bracing the tunnel 
was hard, slow work. Pete was no 
longer affected by the risk, but he 
was sadly lacking in initiative. After 
the first few minutes, Sam took the 
lead position, letting the other robot 
haul rubble and fetch supplies. By 
the time the men came back, less 
than twenty feet had been braced 
and lined properly with canvas and 
mesh. 

There was room for no more than 
two in the tunnel, and the robots 
were better suited than the men for 
such work. Barney and Lee stayed 
near the entrance, hauling back 
baskets of rubble, while Gregg op- 
erated the digger shovel occasionally 
to clear the ledge. The cave-in seem- 
ed to have loosened part of the 
mound above them, and the work 
became increasingly difficult as they 
moved further in. It was long after 
noon before the last section was 
cleared, to expose a six-foot circle 
of what seemed to be machine-roll- 
ed aluminum sheet that blocked fur- 
ther progress. 

Gregg came down to inspect it, 
tapping the metal doubtfully. 
“Sounds hollow, and not very thick. 
Can you cut it?” 

“There may be danger for you. 
Master,” Pete warned hesitantly. 

Gregg sighed, but stepped back. 
“All right. I’ll keep my oxygen mask 
tight. Go ahead, Sam, open it!” 

If the metal had ever been tem- 



84 



IF 




pered or work-hardened, time had 
softened it. While Pete held the light, 
Sam began cutting it with the mesh 
snips. He tore the last few feet 
free and folded the panel back 
against the tunnel wall. 

All the men were crowded into 
the tunnel by the time he had fin- 
ished, pressing forward and craning 
their necks to see what lay beyond. 
But they waited impatiently while 
Sam found a place inside for the 
light and Gregg took the necessary 
photographs for the record. 

Metal walls and roof formed a 
low dome, not more than twenty 
feet in diameter. A battered, dented 
door at one side was flanked by 
benches that curved along the walls. 
Opposite the door, hanging shelves 
rose to a height of six feet. The 
largest feature of the room was di- 
rectly in front of those — an en- 
closed table or desk, with a seat at- 
tached to it on a swinging arm. The 
floor was of metal, strewn with 
wreckage and damaged machinery. 

Sam’s eyes swung rapidly over the 
scene and then center^ on the ob- 
jects scattered across the shelves 
and spilled onto the floor below. 
There were dozens of familiar metal 
containers and other things that 
could only be books. 

He was adross the room as soon 
as the camera stopped clicking, 
reaching »ut cautiously for them. 
Beside him, he heard Gregg’s breath- 
ing catch. He half expected the book 
to crumble at his touch, but what- 
ever the paperlike maiteiial was 
seemed proof against time. There 
was a solid feel to the book and 
the pages turned easily. 



The characters were the same as 
those of Old Trollish, with two new 
additions. But the words were total- 
ly meaningless. 

“Aliens,” Gregg said. 'They had 
to be. There isn’t a thing ia this 
room designed to fit troll hands or 
bodies. Let’s take a look at Iflie can- 
nisters.” 

O nce it was pointed out, the un- 
trollish nature of everything 
was obvious. Even the door handle 
was too high. A man or robot might 
have sat at the desk Pete and Dick- 
son were inspecting, but no troll 
could have used the swinging seat. 

“Trolls maybe didn’t design any 
of this, but they sure ruined it,” 
Barney called. “Better take a look 
at this, Jim.” 

He and Lee had gone at nnee to 
examine the wrecked machinery. 
Now he began pointing out what 
they had discovered. 

The largest piece was obviously 
some kind of organic fuel cell, with 
the piping around it reduced to 
twisted metal shreds. Something 
with vats and movable flat belts 
might have been either the source 
ef the plastic paper or a way of 
printing on it — or both; there 
wasn’t enough left to be sure. And 
a beautifully simple typewheel writ- 
ing machine was intact, except for 
its motor. Half a dozen broken stone 
axe heads could be seen to show 
what had caused the damage. 

“Looks like they started a news 
press here, and vox pop didn’t like 
the truth,” Barney said bitterly, 
“Every blamed thing that nsoved is 
smashed to smithereens.”

85 




Gregg nodded thoughtfully. 
“Well, get what details you can 
with the camera.” He motioned to 
Dickson, who was watching Pete 
try to pry open a locked desk draw- 
er. “Give them a hand moving 
things, will you? I want to find out 
if there’s any information in those 
cannisters,” 

The containers opened easily to 
pressure in the right places, and this 
time the writing was in Trollish. Sam 
found a text in agriculture, one on 
metallurgy, and a duplicate of that 
on astronomy. Then the fourth came 
open, and he let out a cry for Gregg. 

There were two columns this 
time, one in Trollish and the other 
in what must be alien words. They 
flipped through the pages, finding 
another section with the order re- 
versed. It was obviously a bilingual 
dictionary, alphabetized for both 
languages, and covering several 
thousand words. Two other com- 
plete sets of sheets lay behind the 
first. 

“What a Rosetta Stone!” Gregg 
exulted. He was literally caressing 
the sheets. “And in triplicate! With 
this, we’ll be reading all those books 
in a matter of days, Sam. And 
once — ” 

A loud crashing sound drowned 
out the rest of his words. They jerk- 
ed around to see Pete stamping and 
leaping madly beside the desk. Dick- 
son shouted an order for him to 
stop, but the robot went on unheed- 
ingly. By the time Sam could reach 
him, Pete had reduced whatever had 
been in the opened desk drawer to 
a mess of plastic lumps and metal 
scraps that could never have mean- 



ing. Then he halted, standing quietly 
in the ruin he had made. 

Dickson approached him, striving 
for a note of firm command. ‘Tm 
giving you an order, Pete. I order 
you to tell me what that was.” 

Pete made no answer. He began 
backing away, shaking his head. 

And more orders from Dickson 
only made him back away faster. 

IV 

4 4/^h, let him alone,” Gregg said 
at last. “It’s your damned 
prime law — something that Pete 
thinks might harm men, obviously. 
That means anything from the ulti- 
mate weapon to some alien dirty pic- 
ture. And since he thinks telling us 
would also harm us, we’ll never 
know whether it was important or 
not. It’s my fault for letting a rule- 
and fool-crippled robot in here and 
not having him watched. Take him 
back to the digger, Dr. Dickson.” 
Lee held out a thick wrist, indi- 
cating his watch. “We’d all better 
go back with the slavemaster, Jim. 
By the time we can weld some mesh 
over the entrance to keep trolls out, 
it’ll be night.” 

Gregg frowned in surprise as he 
checked his own watch. Then he 
nodded. He gathered up a set of 
the dictionary sheets, selected a cou- 
ple of books at random, and fell in 
beside Sam as they headed back 
through the tunnel. But as they near- 
ed the entrance, he stopped. 

“I think this place is taboo to 
trolls, even without the gate. But I’ll 
feel better making sure. You go on, 
Sam.”

go on. I wasn’t planning on 
getting much sleep tcmig^t, anyhow,” 
Sam told him with heavy sarcasm. 

Gregg chuckled. “You’re right, of 
course. Thanks. I’ll send down fresh 
batteries and my rifle before we 
leave. See you in the morning.” 

He hurried after the others, and 
Sam turned back, studying the situ- 
ation. From the desk, he could see a 
good distance up the tunnel by ar- 
ranging the light carefully. And by 
turning in the seat, he could reach 
most of the books. He spread out 
the second word list and prepared 
to do some serious studying. 

Barney brought the rifle and bat- 
teries down a quarter hour later. He 
pulled a sandwich out of his pouch 
and sat down on the ruined fuel cell 
to eat it. “They got the gate welded 
down pretty good,” he announced 
casually. 

Sam shook his head gently in the 
gesture he used where a man would 
smile. “Thanks, Barney.” 

“Don’t mention it, youngster. 
Temperature ought to stay com- 
fortable down here, at least.” The 
man finished eating and drew a thin 
air mattress from his pouch. When 
it had blown itself up, he began 
kiddng an area free of debris. 
“Wake me if anything should hap- 
pen” 

Somehow, in spite of the oxygen 
mask, Barney managed to snore. 
But Sam was rather glad of the 
sound. He stared down at the old 
man fondly, remembering the first 
human he’d ever loved. Pop had 
been officially only head jailor of 
the robot school, but he’d somehow 
managed to provide an endless 



stream of games and stories for the 
students. He’d laughed away their 
failures and given them all the same 
advice when they finally graduated. 
By now, he was a legend among 
robots, and his words were hallowed 
in tradition. 

Pete had missed all that in his 
conditioning. It was no wonder he 
acted more like a half-trained dog 
than a real person. 

A t midnight, Sam checked the tun- 
nel. The gate was still secure. 
It was too dark to spot the trolls, 
but he could hear them yammering 
all around, with one repeated cry: 
Yar Noo biliyet! The first two 
words meant “Rock Devil” and the 
third was obscene. They were ’'work- 
ing up to something, but they didn’t 
sound dangerous yet. 

He went back to pore over the 
books. He’d given up any hope 
of making sense by translation; too 
many words were missing from the 
bilingual sheets for immediate sense. 
He was looking for the few books 
that had pictures, studying those. 
One showed a night sky with a star 
pattern that might help astronomers 
locate the alien sun. Another yielded 
several group scenes, and those 
disturbed him. They showed a dark, 
graceful people with two legs and 
four slender arms. But their skins 
were too smooth, their bodies too 
similar, and their heads too identi- 
cally spherical. 

“Something eating you, Sam?” 
Barney asked suddenly. He must 
have been awake for some time, 
since he was already chewing away 
at a cud of tobacco. 



88 



IF 




Sam shook his head, unwilling 
to state his suspicions yet. 

Barney grunted. “Well, some- 
thing’s eating me. From where I 
sit, I can see half an inch showing 
under the bottom plate of youridesk, 
and I want to know what’s under- 
neath, holding it up. Think you can 
move it?” 

A minute later, they were looking 
at the spot where the desk had stood. 
A smooth, oval bole had been cut 
through the metal floor and dug in- 
to the ground below. Heavy rocks 
were jamm^ tightly together to fill 
it completely. 

Barney looked at the rocks and 
then at the desk that had been placed 
over them. “Lx)oks like something 
was meant to stay down there. I 
got a hunch we’re going to have a 
lot of work getting it out.” 

It wasn’t too hard at first, though 
some of the stones weighed more 
than a hundred pounds. But the 
work increased with depth, and they 
were eight feet down before they 
reached the last layer. The men and 
Pete had already returned in the 
morning and were clustered around 
the hole when Sam finally freed 
what lay at the bottom and passed 
it up. 

The head was no longer spherical, 
the metal chdst was horribly crush- 
ed, and most of the brown enamel 
was gone. But as Barney and Lee 
stretched it out on the floor, it was 
still slim and graceful, with two 
legs and four slender arms, like all 
the people in the book. 

And like them ... it was a ro- 
bot. 

“So that’s the Rock Devil,” Gregg 



said finally, without surprise. 

Dickson was studying it witk kor- 
rified fascination. “It doesn’t look 
much like rock to me.” 

“It does to trolls,” Sam told kkn. 
“If a thing bleeds or gives sap, tt’s 
bel — food; otherwise, it’s yar — 
rock. Yar that acts like bel is a 
devil — noo — and smart trolls or- 
dinarily look the other way. But this 
is the ultimate Yar Noo .and sup- 
posed to drive them into a killing 
rage.” 

“It’s going to complicate our prob- 
lem, but I guess it’s worth the risk,” 
Gregg decided. “Any trouble here 
last night?” 

“No troll trouble. Just a lot of 
noise.” 

Gregg frowned. “That’s odd. We 
had a sort of war dance around us 
all night. Two of the chiefs I know 
came to warn me that if we didn’t 
make sure the Rock Devil was dead 
and get out quickly they couldn’t 
control things much longer. I’ve 
abandoned camp already. I figured 
on loading up here and heading south 
to Ramses at once. But now we’ve 
got to smuggle the Rock Devil out. 
Any idea how?” 

“Cover him with a piece of can- 
vas, and I’ll carry him down and 
load him in the digger,” Sam sug- 
gested. It was the simplest way. 

A pparently it was too simple for 
the others. Eventually they de- 
cided to make four drawstring bags 
front the canvas. One would con- 
tain the Rock Devil, and three others 
would be filled to the same size 
with everything else. These would be 
lowered one at a time by crane. 



A CODE FOR SAM 



89 




The bag with the Rock Devil would 
go last, after they saw the troll re- 
action to the others. 

“Pete will have to operate the 
crane,” Gregg decided. “Dickson, 
you supervise and make sure there 
are no slip-ups this time. Lee and 
Barney can improvise the bags, then 
go down to stow things in the dig- 
ger. Sam, you’ll stay with me and 
select what we’ll take.” 

The thick canvas bags were 
clumsy, but they seemed strong 
enough. Sam bundled the alien into 
the first to give them a model for 
the size of the others. Then they 
began stripping the dome of all of 
any value. Two books, the writing 
machine and Sam’s spare batteries 
were left to be carried out after the 
bags were safely down. Sam slung 
the rifle over his shoulder and began 
moving the sacks to the entrance. 

The trolls were about a hundred 
feet beyond the digger and herded 
between all the mounds. They kept 
their fixed stares on the ledge as 
Sam moved out with a sack, jabber- 
ing obscenities, but made no sign of 
taking other action. 

At least Pete could handle simple 
machine controls well enough. The 
shovel swung up smoothly to level 
with the ledge, accepted the first 
sack from Sam, and carried it down 
directly to jvhere Lee and Barney 
were waiting. The trolls hopped 
about and yelled, but they made no 
effort to interfere. The second and 
third sacks followed. Sam waited 
until all were stowed in the digger 
before bringiiig out the one with 
the alien and dropping it onto the 
shovel. 



The crane drew backwards — and 
swung suddenly away from the men 
waiting below! The digger tracks 
spun into motion, slewing the ma- 
chine around to face away from the 
mound. Inside it, Sam could see 
Dickson pounding futilely against 
Pete’s hands. Then the man gave up 
and ran back to leap for the machine 
and stumble toward Lee and Bar- 
ney. Gregg started toward the ledge, 
but Sam pulled him back. 

“We’re better off up here, Jim, 
if there’s trouble. Call the others 
up.” 

Gregg yelled down, and all three 
men began climbing toward the 
ledge. Dickson looked sick as Sam 
pulled him up the last few feet. 

The digger was rolling forward 
now. Trolls spilled back and aside as 
it headed for them. The machine 
drove on for perhaps two hundred 
feet along the old road toward camp 
until it came to a rocky section. 
Then the shovel opened and spilled 
its contents directly in front of one 
caterpillar tread. The churning 
plates of the track hit the sack and 
began pounding across it, carrying 
ten tons of weight to grind it against 
the rock. The digger reversed itself 
and reversed again. It made six more 
passes before it stopped and Pete 
dropped from it. The robot began 
walking back toward the mound 
casually. Trolls jittered and then 
made room for him. 

“They didn’t spot it,” Gregg said 
suddenly. “They don’t know we had 
the Rock Devil. Sam, if we can get 
the digger back, we may still get out 
of this.” 

Sam nodded and threw his am-

ened hearing brought him the sound

. The words were in Old Trollish, 
but the PT brain of the robot had 
learned the lesson well — and some- 
how he had managed to guess the 
cant of primitive oratory. **Yar Noo 
alidet! The Rock Devil is dead! We 
bound him and cast him from us, 
we ground him into the dust of the 
earth, we made him like the grains 
of sand that blow before the wind. 
His breath is spent, and his power, 
forgotten. He cannot rise again!” 
There was a delay as the ancient 
form of the language filtered through 
to the trolls. Then they were leaping 
for the area where the digger had 
destroyed the alien. And a moment 
later, the message was being relayed 
forward. 

^*Yar Noo alidet! Yar Noo alidetr 
V 

T he results came quickly. There 
was a series of wild cries, and 
then the trolls were leaping forward 
toward the mound, drawing their 
weapons. Bows were lifted, and ar- 
rows began whistling through the 
air. They fell short, but the next 
flight would reach. 

Sam swung, his arms, shoving the 
men down the tunnel. He turned 
again, ^yanked the rifle from his 
back, and sighted quickly. He knew 
some of the chiefs, and he picked 
them off while the arrows banged 
against him. At the death of the fifth 
chief, the trolls faltered. As the 



eighth dropped, they began retreat- 
ing. 

He lowered the rifle and stretched 
out a hand to help Pete up, while 
Gregg came from the tuaael en- 
trance to join them, then otood 
watching as the last of the trolls 
vanished behind the digger and near- 
by mounds. Now that the fini rush 
had failed, they would spend the 
day picking new chiefs and yelling 
their courage back, waiting for the 
obvious advantage of darkness. But 
meantime, they were making sure 
that their victims had no safe line 
of escape. 

‘They may relax a little near 
sundown,” Sam decided. “Then if 1 
can reach the digger while yon cover 
me with the rifle, we may have a 
chance. I’ll back it up to the BK>und, 
and you’D have to make a concerted 
run for it. If you get inside, it may 
protect us long enough tn get 
through the mob and outrun them.” 

Back inside the little dome, the 
men listened grimly as Gregg out- 
lined the situation and plan to them. 
Lee and gamey nodded as be fin- 
ished. 

Dickson shook his head. “Not all 
of us. Dr. Gregg, that robot isn’t 
safe with us. He deliberately refused 
to obey. He got us into this!” 

“Sit down, Dr. Frankenstein,” 
Lee said sharply. A big hand put 
force behind his order. “We’re all 
in this together — even you! With 
what I heard about the danger to 
us of the Rock Devil and the trolls’ 
insistence we kill it, I thought Pete 
was doing the right thing. And I 
still don’t blame him. What got into 
the trolls, anyhow, Jim?” 



92 



IF 




Gregg shrugged. “Who knows? 
Wc can guess. But Sam and I were 
always uncertain about the legends 
and the parts we couldn’t seem to 
get. We knew they were afraid of 
his reviving — but now it seems the 
only reason they didn’t attack us 
before was because of that fear. 
They liked his trinkets, but when he 
wanted to change their ways, they 
killed and buried him. That’s all we 
know.” 

“No, Jim,” Sam corrected him. 
“They didn’t bury him. That hole 
in the floor isn’t troll work. There 
had to be at least two aliens. One 
found the first and buried him, then 
took such vengeance on the trolls 
that they still remember. They must 
have thought it was the same one. 
So they are afraid he’ll revive 
again.” 

“You mean that robot’s master 
was with him?” Dickson asked. 

G regg shook his head. ‘There 
were no alien ‘masters.’ From 
the books I studied, the masters died 
off so long ago that the robot 
branch no longer has dear records 
of k. Something happened — per- 
haps some disease — and the robots 
carried on alone.” 

“Disease?, Murder!” Dickson came 
to his feet with a scream, his face 
taut and white with all the ancient 
Earth fears he had bottled up un- 
der his mask of scientific study. 
“The robots killed their masters. Just 
as ours will do. We’re not safe while 
a single robot exists. The3r*re the 
most dangerous threat to our lives — 
and you sit there!” 

Lee was moving toward him, but 



Gregg’s fist stopped the tirade. 
“Pete, don’t listen — ” 

But Gregg’s words were too late. 
Pete swung abruptly, grabbing Sam’s 
spare batteries from the desk, and 
he was pounding up the tunnel. By 
the time Sam could get past' the 
tangle of men around Dickson, the 
other robot had vanished. 

“He’ll kill himself,” Gregg shout- 
ed. “He has to. If he’s the greatest 
source of harm to men, that damned 
first law has to negate the third. 
We’ve got to stop him.” 

Sam shook his head, but he fol- 
lowed the others up the tunnel to 
the entrance. Even Dickson man- 
aged to stagger along with the oth- 
ers, moaning and grimacing with 
the pain of his jaw as sanity re- 
turned to him. 

At first, there was no sign of 
Pete. Then they saw that the trolls 
had begun to stream forth and clus- 
ter below the ledge, their vulpine 
stares fixed upwards, Sam followed 
their gaze and finally spotted the 
other robot. Pete had almost reach- 
ed the top of the mound, scramb- 
ling and fighting for holds in the 
crumbling surface. As they l#eke4, 
he reached the peak and sat down 
upon it. 

Methodically, he began to open 
his chest plate and change from hk 
fresh batteries to the used spares he 
had scooped from the desk. Below, 
the trolls began screaming. “Yor/ 
Yar Noor 

**Yar Noo haremetr Pete shouted 
back in old TroUlsh. ‘The Rock 
Devil has returned! You did evil as 
you did of Old, and the Rock Devil

this body and became strong again. 
Fear me and run from me, little bugs 
of evil!” 

Most of them bad already begun 
to draw back, though a few were 
lifting their bows. Now Pete stood 
up again, the two fresh batteries in 
his hands. 

And Sam could see that the pro- 
tective caps were removed, expos- 
ing the bare terminals. 

“Down!” he cried sharply to the 
men. 

Pete jumped, holding the bat- 
teries, moving them precisely and 
slowly toward his own metal body. 
And' just before he landed among 
the screaming trolls, he moved his 
hands to short the terminals against 
himself. 

Those batteries were capable of 
holding a hundred ampere hours at 
more than a hundred volts pressure 
as a strain in the space within them. 
And now suddenly twenty kilowatt 
hours of potential energy screamed 
out in a terrible attempt to become 
raw heat. 

When the explosion of light and 



heat was over, there were no trolls 
except the dead and the fleeing. 

Pete’s torment was over. The laws 
and idiocy that had made his life 
a hell where all he did was wrong 
had been repealed. 

4 4TTTe can go home now,” Sam 
VV told the men as they 
emerged from the tunnel. “I guess 
we can even go out to the stars on 
the great Gregg Expedition to find 
the aliens. But first, Barney, will you 
help me take what’s left of Pete and 
bury him in the hole like the other 
Rock Devil?” 

And with the mangled body would 
go a card that Sam had carried for 
all the years since he had graduated 
— a cheap little printed card of 
congratulations with the scrawl of a 
janitor on the back. It was the code 
a man had inscribed for Sam: 

Take care of yourself — and al- 
ways try to leave things a little bet- 
ter for the next fellow, 

Pete hadn’t been given such a 
code, of course. But he’d earned the 
right to it, nonetheless. END

THE BABE IN THE OVEN 

by JOHN T. SLADEK 

Tough day! The baby was a 
spy, and the friendly parish 



priest was 



A gnes had been wishing for a 
baby all day, so it was no sur- 
prise to her when she peeked through 
the glass door of the oven and found 
one. 

Bundled in clean flannel, it slept 
on the wire rsick while she scrubbed 
out dusty bottles, fixed formula and 
dragged down the crib from the at- 
tic. By the time Glen came home 
from work, she was giving the baby 
its first bottle. 

“Look!” she exclaimed. “A baby I” 
“Oh, my <jod, where did you get 
that?” he said, his healthy pink face 
going white. “You know it’s illegal to 
have babies.” 

“I found it. Why illegal?” 
“Everything is illegal,” he whis- 
pered, parting the curtains cautious- 
ly to peer out. “Damn near.” The 
face upon Glen’s big, pink, cubical 
head looked somewhat drawn. 



accomplice! 



“What’s the matter?” 

“Oh, nothing,” she said testily. 
“We’re going to have a gas war, 
that’s all.” 

Glen was a pathetic figure as he 
moved so as not to cast a shadow 
on the curtains. His bright, skintight 
plastic suit was far from skintight, 
and even his cape looked baggy. 

“Is it? Is that all?” 

“No. Say, that neighbor of ours 
'has been raking leaves an awfully 
long time.” 

“Answer me. What’s wrong? 
Something at the office?” 

“Everything. The carbon paper 
and stamps and paper clips have be- 
gun to disappear. I’m afraid they’ll 
blame me. The boss is going to buy 
a computer to keep track of the loss. 
Someone stole my ration book on 
the train, and I found I had last 
week’s newspaper. IBM stock is fall- 



95 





ing, faintly falling. 1 have a cold, or 
something. And — and they’re do- 
ing away with the Dewey Decimal 
System.” 

“You’re just overwrought Why 
don’t you just sit down and dandle 
Gur new baby on your knee, while I 
rustle up some supper.” 

“Stealing food! It’s indecent!” 

“Everyone does it, dear. Did you 
know 1 tound the baby in the oven?” 

“No!” 

“Yes, the queerest thing. I had 
just been wishing I’d find a baby 
somewhere.” 

“How are the other appliances 
doing?” 

“The automatic washer tried to de- 
\our me. The dishwasher is fading 
away; we must have missed a pay- 
ment.” 

“Yes, and we’re overdrawn,” he 
said, sighing. 

“The garbage disposal is hulk- 
ing.” 

“Hulking?” 

“Over there.” 

He did not look where she was 
pointing. He continued to peer out 
the window, where the weather situ- 
ation was building up. A Welcome 
Wagon moved slowly down the 
street. He could not read the sign, 
but he recognized the armor plat- 
ing and the blue snouts of machine 
guns. 

“Yes, it just sits there hulking in 
the sink, and it won’t eat anything. 
It ateMts guarantee, though.” 

T he neighbor, a “Mr. Green,” 
paused in his raking to note 
down the Welcome Wagon’s license 
number. 



“Not hulking, darling. Sulking** 
Glen said. 

“You have such a big vocabulary. 
And you don’t even read M^w to 
Build Bit Wordsr 

“1 read Existential Digest, when 1 
find the time,” he confessed. **But 
last week I took their lest and learn- 
ed that I’m not alienated enough. 
That’s why I’m so damned proud 
of our kids.” 

“Jenny and Peter?” 

“The same.” 

Agnes sighed. “I’d like to read a 
copy of the Irish Mail sometime. By 
the way, the potatoes had poison 
again. Every eye.” She went into the 
bedroom and laid the baby in its 
crib. 

“I’m going down and turn some- 
thing on the lathe,” Glen announced. 
“Something good.” 

“Take off your cape first. You re- 
member the safety laws we kamed 
at PTA.” 

“Lord, how could I forget? Snuff 
out all candles. Never stand in a 
canoe or bathtub. Give name, rank 
and serial number only. Accept 
checks only if endorsed in your 
presence. Do not allow rats to chew 
on matches, should they so desire.” 
He disappeared, and, at the same 
time, Jenny and Peter came home 
from school, demanding a “snack.” 
All the kids on television had 
“snacks,” they explained. Agnes 
gave them Hungarian goulash, bread 
and butter, coffee and apple pie. 
They paid 95c each, and each tipped 
her 15c. They were gruff, dour 
eight-year-o<lds, who talked little 
while they ate. Agnes was a little 
afraid of them. After their snack,

they belted on guns and went out 
to hunt other children, before it grew 
too dark to see them. 

Agnes sighed and sat down to her 
secret transmitter. 

“AUNT ROSE EXPECTED BY 
NOON TRAIN,” she sent. “HAVE 
MADE ARRGTS FOR HER 
GLADIOLI. SEE THAT FUDGE 
MEETS 0400 PARIS PLANE 
WITH CANDLES. THE GARDEN- 
ER NEEDS TROWEL XPRESS.” 

In a moment, the reply came. 
“TROWEL ARRGD. FUDGE HAS 
NO REPEAT NO CANDLES. 
WILL USE DDT. HOLD ROSE 
TILL VIOLET HEARD FROM.” 

Always the same, tired, meaning- 
less messages. 

Agnes sighed again and hid her 
transmitter in the cookie jar as Glen 
came up the stairs. He had, she 
knew, his own transmitter in the 
basement. For all she could tell, it 
was him she was calling each eve- 
ning. 

“Look at this!” he said proudly 
and displayed a newel post. 

Outside, a plane dropped leaflets. 
The neighbor rushed about, raking 
them up and burning them. 

Every night, the same damned 
thing,” said Glen, gnashing his teeth. 
“Every night they drop leaflets tell- 
ing us to give up, and every night 
that jerk burns them all. At this 
rate, we’ll never even learn who 
‘they’ are.” 

“Is it really so important?” she 
asked. He would not answer. “Come 
on, quit hulking.. I’ll tdl you what I 
want to do. I want to ride on a real- 
way train.” 

"'Railway'' he corrected. “You 



can’t. The Public Health Depart- 
ment says that going more than thir- 
ty miles an hour contributes signfi- 
cantly to cancer.” 

“A lot you care what happens to 
me!” 

G len bowed his great cube of a 
head resignedly over the' tele- 
vision set. “You’ll notice/* he said, 
“that it looks like an innocent Army- 
Navy football game. And so it may 
be. Perhaps the ball won’t blow up 
when he Idcks it. Perhaps that series 
of plays is only a coincidence.” 

“No. 27 fades back to pass,” she 
murmured. “What would that mean, 
I wonder?” 

Glen felt her hand reach out to 
touch his. He held hands with his 
wife in the darkened living room, 
after making sure she was not wear- 
ing her poison ring. 

“The common cold,” he muttered. 
""They call it the ‘common cold.* By 
the way, have I told you we’re over- 
drawn?” 

“Yes. It’s that damned car. You 
would have to order all those special 
features.” 

“The bazooka in the trunk? Tlie 
direction-finder radio? The gun tur- 
ret? Everyone else has had them 
for years, Agnes. What am I sup- 
posed to do if the police start chasmg 
me? Try to outrun them, me with 
all that armor plate?” . 

“I just don’t see what we’re go- 
ing to live on,” she said. 

“We can eat green stamps, until 

^t* 

“No. They confiscated them this 
morning, I forgot to tell you.” 

The children trooped in, smelling

of mud and cordite. Jenny had 
scratched her knee on a barb^ wire 
barrier. Agnes applied a bandaid to 
it, gave them coffee and donuts, 15c, 
and sent them upstairs to brush their 
teeth. 

“And don’t, for God’s sake, use 
the tap water,” Glen shouted. 
“There’s something in it.” 

He walked into the room where 
the baby slept and returned in a 
moment, shaking his head. “Could 
have sworn I heard him ticking.” 
“Oh Glen, let’s get away for a 
few days. Let’s go to the country.” 
“Oh sure. Travel twenty miles over 
mined roads to look at a couple of 
cowpies. You wouldn’t dare get out 
of the car, for the deadly snakes. 
They’ve sowed the ground with 
poison ivy and giant viruses.” 

“I wouldn’t care! Just a breath of 
fresh air — ” 

“Sure. Nerve gas. Mustard gas. 
Tear gas. Pollen, Even if we sur- 
vived, we’d be arrested. No one 
ever goes into the country any more 
but dope peddlers, looking for wild 
tobacco.” 

A gnes began to cry. Everyone was 
someone else. No one was who 
they were. The garbageman scrutin- 
ized her messages to the milkman. In 
the park, the pigeons all wore metal 
capsules taped to their legs. There 
were cowpifes in the country, but no 
cows. Even at the supermarket you 
had to be careful. If you picked out 
items that seemed to form any sort 
of pattern — 

“Are there any popsicles left?” 
Glen asked. 

“No. There’s nothing in the ice- 



box but a leftover custard. We can’t 
eat that, it has a map in it. Glen, 
what are we going to eat?” 

“I don’t know. How about . 
the baby? Well, don’t look at me like 
that! You found him in the oven, 
didn’t you? Suppose you had just 
lit the oven without looking in?” 
“No! I will not give up my baby 
for a — a casserole!” 

“All right! I was merely making 
a suggestion, that’s all.” 

It was dark, now, thrgughout the 
lead-walled house, except in the 
kitchen. Out the quartz picture win- 
dow, dusk was falling on the lawn, 
on the lifeless body of “Mr. Green.” 
The television showed a panel dis- 
cussion of eminent doctors, who 
wondered if eating were not the ma- 
jor cause of insanity. 

Agnes went to answer the front 
door, while Glen went back to the 
kitchen. 

“Excuse me,” the priest said to 
Agnes. “I’m on a sick call. Someone 
was good enough to loan me his 
Diaper Service truck, and I’m afraid 
it has broken down. I wonder if I 
might use your phone?” 

“Certainly, father. It’s bugged, of 
course.” 

“Of course.” 

She stood aside to let him pass, 
and just then Glen shouted, “The 
baby! He’s at the custard!” 

Agnes and the priest dashed out 
to see. In the clean, well-lighted 
kitchen, Glen stood gaping at the 
open refrigerator. Somehow the 
baby had gotten into it, for now 
Agnes could see his diapered bottom 
and pink toes sticking out from a 
lower shelf.

IF 




“He’s hungry,” she said. 

“Take another look,” Glen grated. 
Leaning closer, she saw the child 
had pulled the map from the cus- 
tard. He was taking photos of it 
with a tiny, baby-sized camera. 
“Microfilm!” she gasped. 

“Who are you?” Glen asked the 
priest. 

1 m — 

“Wait a minute. You don’t look 
like a man of the cloth to me.” 

I t was true, Agnes saw in the light. 

The breeze rustled the carbon- 
paper cassock, and she saw it was 
held together with paper clips. His 
stole was, on closer examination, a 
strip of purple stamps. 

“If you’re a priest,” Glen con- 
tinued, “why do I see on your Ro- 
man collar the letterhead of my of- 
ficer 

“Very clever of you,” said the 
man, drawing a pistol from his 
sleeve. “I’m sorry you saw through 
our little ruse. Sorry for you, that 
is.” 

*'Ourr said Glen. He looked at 
the baby. “Hold on. Agnes, what 
kind of vehicle did he drive up in?” 
“A diaper truck.” 

“Aha! I’ve been waiting a long 
time to catch up with you — Diaper 
Man! Your chequered career has 
gone on far too long.’' 

“Ah, so you’ve recognized me and 
my dimple-kneed assistant, have you? 
But I’m afraid it won’t do you much 
good. You see, we already have the 
photos, and there is a bullet here for 
each of you. Don’t try to stop me!” 



Watching them, the false priest 
scooped up the baby. “I think I had 
better kill the two of you in any 
case,” he said. “You already know 
too much about my modus operan- 
di.'" The baby in his arms waved the 
camera gleefully and gooed its 
derision. 

“All right,” said Diaper Man. 
“Face the wall, please.” 

“Now!” Glen said. He leaped for 
the gun, while Agnes deftly kicked 
the camera from the baby’s chubby 
fist. 

The infant spy looked startled, but 
he acted fast, a tiny blur of mo- 
tion. Scooping up two fistfuls of cus- 
tard, he flung them in Glen’s eyes. 
Gasping, Glen dropped the gun, as 
the infamous pair made their dash 
for freedom. 

“You’ll never take me alive!” 
snarled the false priest, vaulting in- 
to his truck. 

“Let them go,” said Glen. He 
tasted the custard. “I should have 
realized earlier the baby wasn’t 
ticking, he was clicking. Let them 
go. They won’t get far, and we’ve 
saved the map — for whatever it’s 
worth.” 

“Are you all right, darling?” 

“Fine. Mmm. This is pretty good, 
Agnes.” 

She blushed at the compliment. 
There was a muffled explosion, and 
in the distance, they could see flames 
shooting high in the air. 

“Esso bombing the Shell station,” 
said Glen. 

The gas war had begun.

HALFWAY HOUSE 

by ROBERT SILVERBERG 

Alfieri was a dead man who wanted 
to live. But there was a price — 
his life would rto more be his own! 



A fterward, Alfieri realized that 
you must give a life to gain a 
life. Now, he was too interested 
simply in staying alive to think much 
about profundities. 

He was Vuomo dal fuoco in bocca, 
the man with fire in his mouth. Can- 
cer clawed at his throat. The vocoder 
gave him speech; but the raging fire 
soon would burn through to the core 
of him, and there would be no more 
Franco Alfieri. That was hard to 
accept. So he came to the Fold for 
aid. 

He had the money. That was what 
it took, in part, to enter that gateway 
of worlds : money, plenty of it. Those 
who ran the* Fold did not do it for 
sweet charity’s sake. The power drain 
alone ^ was three million kilowatts 
every time the Fold was opened. 
You could power a good-sized city 
on a load like that. But Alfieri was 
willing to pay what it cost. The 
money would shortly be of no use 



to him whatever, unless the beings 
on the far side of the Fold gave his 
life back to him. 

“You stand on that bedplate,” a 
technician told him. “Put your feet 
along the red triangular areas. Grasp 
the rail — so. Then wait.” 

Alfieri obeyed. He was no longer 
in the habit of taking such brusque 
orders, but he forgave the man for 
his rudeness. To the technician, Al- 
fieri was so much wealthy meat, al- 
ready going maggotty. Alfieri posi- 
tioned his feet and looked down at 
the mirror^bright polish of his point- 
ed black shoes. He grasped the fur- 
ry yellow skin of the rail. He waited 
for the power surge. 

H e knew what would happen. Al- 
fieri had been an engineer in 
Milan, twenty years back, when the 
European power grid was just com- 
ing in. He understood the workings 
of the Fold as well as — well, as 



100 




well as anyone else who was not a 
mathematician. Alfieri had left en- 
gineering to found an industrial em- 
pire that sprawled from the Alps to 
the blue Mediterranean, but he had 
kept up with technology. He was 
proud of that. He could walk into 
any factory, go straight to a work- 
bench, display a rare knowledge of 
any man’s labor. Unlike most top 
executives, his knowledge was deep 
as well as broad. 

Alfieri knew, then, that when the 
power surge came, it would momen- 
tarily create a condition they called 
a singularity, found in the natural 
universe only in the immediate vicini- 
ty of stars that were in their last mo- 
ments of life. A collapsing star, a 
spent supernova, generates about it- 
self a warp in the universe, a fun- 
nel to nowhere, the singularity. As 
the star shrinks, it approaches its 
Schwarzchild radius, the critical point 
when the singularity will devour it. 
Time runs more slowly for the dying 
star as it nears the radius; its faint 
light shifts conspicuously toward the 
red; time rushes to infinity as the 
star is caught and swallowed by the 
singularity. And a man who hap- 
pens to be present? He passes into 
the singularity also. Tidal gravita- 
tional forces of infinite strength 
seize him; fie is stretched to the 
limit and simultaneously compressed, 
attaining zero volume and infinite 
density, and he is hurled — some- 
where. 

They had no dying stars in this 
laboratory. But for a price they 
could simulate one. For Alfieri’s 
bundle of lire they would strain the 
universe and create a tiny opening 



and hurl him through the Fold, to a 
place where pleated universes met, 
to a place where incurable diseases 
were not necessarily incurable. 

Alfieri waited, a trim, dapper man 
of fifty, with thinning sandy hair 
slicked crosswise over the tanned 
dome of his skull. He wore the 
tweed suit he had bought in Lon- 
don in ’95, and a matching gray-green 
tie and his small sapphire ring. He 
gripped the railing. He was not aware 
of it when the surge came, and the 
universe was broken open, and 
Franco Alfieri was catapulted 
through a yawning vortex into a 
place never dreamed of in Newton’s 
philosophy. 

T he being called Vuor said, “This 
is Halfway House.” 

Alfieri looked about him. Super- 
ficially, his surroundings had not 
changed at all. He still stood on a 
glossy copper bedplate, still grasped 
a furry rail. The quartz walls of the 
chamber looked the same. But an 
alien being now peered in, and Al- 
fieri knew he had been translated 
through the Fold. 

The alien’s face was virtually a 
blank: a slit of a mouth below, slits 
of eyes above, no visible nostrils, a 
flat greenish facade, altogether, sit- 
ting on a squat neck, a triangular 
shoulderless trunk, ropy limbs. Al- 
fieri had become accustomed to 
aliens in his dealings, and the sight 
of Vuor did not disturb him, though 
he had never seen one of this sort 
before. 

Alfieri felt sweat churning through 
his pores. Tongues of flame licked at 
his throat. He had refused full seda- 



HALFV/AY HOUSE 



101 




tion, for unless Alfieri’s mind could 
work properly he would not be Al- 
fieri. But the pain was terrible. 

He said, “How soon can I get 
help?” 

“What is the trouble?” 

“Cancer of the throat. You hear 
my voice? Artificial. The larynx is 
gone already. There’s a malignant 
beast eating me. Cut it out of me.” 
The eyeslits closed momentarily. 
Tentacles twined themselves together 
in a gesture that might have been 
sympathy, contempt, or refusal. 
Vuor’s reedy, rasping voice said in 
passable Italian, “We do not help 
you here, you understand. This is 
merely Halfway House, the screening 
point* We distribute you onward.” 
“I know. I know. Well, send me 
to a world where they can cure can- 
cer. I don’t have much time left. I’m 
suffering, and I’m not ready to go. 
There’s still work for me to do on 
Earth. CapisceV 

“What do you do, Franco Alfieri?” 
“Didn’t my dossier arrive?” 

“It did. Tell me about yourself.” 
Alfieri shrugged. His palms were 
growing clammy, and he let go of the 
rail, wishing the alien would let him 
sit down. “I run an engineering com- 
pany,” he said. “Actually, a holding 
company. Alfieri S.A. We do every- 
thing: power distribution, pollution 
control, robotics. We’re getting into 
planetary transformation. Our ope- 
rating divisions employ hundreds of 
thousands of men. We’re more than 
just a money-making concern, 
though. We’re shapers of a better 
world. We — ” He hesitated, realiz- 
ing that he sounded now like one of 
his own public relations flunkies and 



realizing also that he was begging 
for his own life. “It’s a big, impor- 
tant, useful company. I founded it. 
I run it.” 

“And you are very rich. For this 
you wish us to prolong your life? 
You know that we all live under a 
sentence of death. For some sooner, 
others later. The surgeons beyond 
the Fold cannot save everyone. The 
number of sufferers who cry out 
is infinite, Alfieri. Tell me why you 
should be saved.” 

W rath flamed in Alfieri. He sup- 
pressed it. 

He said, “I’m a human being with 
a wife and children. Not good 
enough reason, eh? I’m wealthy 
enough to pay any price to be 
healed. Good? No? Of course not. 
All right, try this: I’m a genius. 
Like Leonardo, like Michelangelo, 
like — like Einstein. You know those 
names? Good. I have a big genius 
too. I don’t paint, I don’t compose 
music. I plan. I organize. I built 
the biggest corporation in Europe. 
I took companies and put them to- 
gether to do things they could never 
have done alone.” 

He glowered at the alien green 
mask beyond the quartz wall. “The 
technology that led Earth to open 
the Fold in the first place — my 
company. The power source — mine. 
I built it. I don’t boast, I speak the 
truth.” 

“You are saying that you have 
made a lot of money.” 

“Danm you, no! I’m saying that 
I’ve created something that didn’t 
exist before, something useful, some- 
thing important not only to Earth 



102 



IF 




but to all the other worlds that meet 
here. And I’m not through creating. 
I’ve got bigger ideas. I need ten 
more years, and I don’t have ten 
months. Can you take the responsi- 
bility of shutting me off? Can you 
afford to throw away all that’s still 
in me? Can you?” 

His unreal voice, which never 
grew hoarse even when he raised it 
to a shout, died away. Alfieri leaned 
on the railing again. The small gold- 
en eyes in the narrow slits regarded 
him impassively. 

After a long silence Vuor said, 
“We will give you our decision short- 
ly.” 

The walls of the chamber went 
opaque. Alfieri paced the little room 
wearily. The taste of defeat was 
sour in his mouth, and somehow it 
did not anger him to know that he 
had failed. He was past cafing. They 
would let him die, of course. They 
would tell him that he had done his 
work, that he had built his company, 
that it saddened them but they had 
to consider the needs of younger 
men whose life-dreams still were un- 
realized. Then, too, they were likely 
to think that merely because he was 
rich, he was not deserving of res- 
cue. Easier was it for a camel to 
go through the eye of a needle, than 
for a richjnan to attain new life on 
the surgeon’s tables of a world be- 
yond the Fold. Yet he couldn’t give 
up now. 

As he awaited his death sentence, 
Alfieri planned how he would spend 
his remaining months of life. Work- 
ing to the end, of course. The heat- 
sink project at Spitzbergen — yes, 
that first, and then — 



T he walls were clear again. Vuor 
had returned. 

“Alfieri, we have made an ap- 
pointment for you on Hinnerang, 
where your cancer will be remitted 
and your tissues restored. But there 
is a price.” 

“Anything! A trillion lirer 
“Not money,” Vuor said. “Service. 
Put your genius to work in our aid.” 
“Tell me how!” 

“Halfway House, you know, is co- 
operatively staffed by representatives 
of the many worlds whose continua 
meet at the Fold. There is not cur- 
rently an administrator from Earth 
on our staff. A vacancy is soon to 
develop. You fill it. Lend us your 
gift for organizing, for administra- 
tion. Take a five-year term among 
us. Then you may return home.” 
Alfieri pondered. He had no par- 
ticular wish to give up five years 
to this place. Too much beckoned 
to him on Earth, and if he were 
away five years, who would take 
the reins of his companies? He might 
return and find himself hopelessly 
out of touch. 

Then he realized the absurdity of 
the thought. Vuor was offering him 
twenty, thirty, fifty more years of 
life. Standing at the edge of Ae grave 
as he was, Alfieri had no right to 
begrudge five of those years if his 
benefactors demanded them. He had 
made his unique administrative abili- 
ties his claim for renewed life; was 
it any surprise that they now wanted 
those same abilities as quid pro quo? 
“Agreed,” Alfieri said. 

“There will, in addition, be a 
monetary payment,” said Vuor, but 
Alfieri hardly cared about that. 



HALFWAY HOUSE

A n infinity of universes met at the 
Fold, as they did at every other 
point in space-time. Only at the 
Fold, though, was it possible now 
to cross from one continuum to an- 
other, thanks to the equipment in- 
stalled there. A web work of 

singularities poked holes in the fab- 
ric of universal structures. Halfway 
House was the shuttle point for this 
loom of worlds; those who could 
convince the administrators that they 
had the right to occupy a valuable 
place on the transfer channels were 
shunted to the worlds of their need. 

An infinity is an infinity, and the 
channels filled all needs. There was 
access, for those who wanted it, to 
a matter-free universe, and to a uni- 
verse filled with one all-encompass- 
ing atom, and to a universe contain- 
ing a world where living beings grew 
steadily younger and not the reverse. 

There were worlds unknown to 
the sons of Adam, with tribes whose 
heads did grow beneath their shoul- 
ders and their mouths in their 
breasts; worlds of monoculi, who 
run swiftly though they have only 
a single leg and a single eye; worlds 
of folk whose mouths are so small 
they take nourishment only through 
a straw; worlds of amoebic intelli- 
gences; worlds where bodily rein- 
carnation is an established fact; 
worlds where dreams become re- 
alities at the snap of a finger. An 
infinity [is an infinity. But for prac- 
tical purposes, only some two dozen 
of those worlds mattered, for they 
were the ones linked by common pur- 
poses and common orientation. 

On one of those worlds, skilled 
surgeons might repair a cancer- 



ravaged throat. In time that skill 
would be imparted to Earth in re- 
turn for some Earthly good, but Al- 
fieri could not wait for the exchange 
to be consummated. He paid his 
fee, and the administrators of Half- 
way House sent him to Hinnerang. 

Alfieri was unaware, once again, 
as he squeezed through the Schwarz- 
child singularity. He had always 
loved tasting unfamiliar sensations, 
and it seemed unfair to him that a 
man should be compressed to zero 
volume and infinite density without 
some tactile knowledge of the fact. 
But so it happened. A dying super- 
nova was simulated for him, and he 
was whisked through the singularity, 
and he emerged in one more identi- 
cal chamber on Hinnerang. 

Here, at least, things looked prop- 
erly alien. There was a reddish tinge 
to the warm, golden sunlight, and 
at night four moons danced in the 
sky. The gravity was half that of 
Earth’s; and as he stood under that 
quartet of shimmering orbs, Ajfieri 
felt a strange giddiness and an in- 
ner access of ecstatic strength. It 
seemed to him that he could leap 
at a bound and snatch one of those 
jewels from the sky. 

T he Hinnerangi were small, angu- 
lar beings with auburn skins, 
high-vaulted skullcaps, and fibrous 
fingers that divided and divided 
again until they formed writhing 
networks of filament at the tips. 
They spoke in sinister whispers, and 
their language struck Alfieri as more 
barbarous than Basque and as con- 
sonant-heavy as Polish; but the usual 
small devices turned their words to 



104 



IF 




the tongue of Dante when they 
needed to communicate with him, a 
miracle that struck Alfieri as more 
awesome than the whole mechanism 
of the Fold, which at least he could 
pretend he understood. 

“We will first negate your pain,” 
his surgeon told him. 

“By knocking out my pain sen- 
sors?” Alfieri asked. “Cutting nerve 
lines?” 

The surgeon regarded him with 
what seemed like grave amusement. 
“There are no pain sensors as such 
in the human nervous system. There 
are merely functional bodies that 
perceive and respond by classifying 
the many patterns of nerve impulses 
arriving from the skin, selecting and 
abstracting the necessary modalities. 
‘Pain’ is simply a label for a class of 
experiences, not always unpleasant. 
We will adjust the control center, 
the gate of responses, so that your 
scanning of input impulses will be 
orientated differently. There will be 
no loss of sensory information; but 
what you feel will no longer be classi- 
fied as pain.” 

At another time, Alfieri might 
have been happy to discuss the re- 
fined semantics of pain theory. Now, 
he was satisfied to nod solemnly and 
permit them to put out the fire that 
raged in hi^ throat. 

It was done, delicately and simp- 
ly. He lay in a cradle of some gum- 
my foam while the surgeon planned 
the next move: a major resection of 
tissue; replacement of lost cell mat- 
ter; regeneration of organs. To Al- 
fieri, wireless transmission of power 
was an everyday matter, but these 
things were the stuff of dreams. He 



submitted. They cut away so much 
of him that it seemed another slice 
of the surgical beam would sever 
his head altogether. Then they re- 
built him. When they were finished, 
he would speak with his own voice 
again, not with an implanted me- 
chanism. But would it really be this 
own, if they had built it for him? 
No matter. It was flesh. Alfieri’s 
heart pumped Alfieri’s blood through 
the new tissue. 

And the cancer? Was it gone? 

The Hinnerangi were thorough. 
They hunted the berserker cells 
through the corridors of his body. 
Alfieri saw colonies of cancer es- 
tablishing themselves in his lungs, 
his kidneys, his intestines. He visu- 
alized marauding creatures stabbing 
good cells with mortal wounds, 
thrusting their own vile fluid into 
unwanted places, replicating a legion 
of goose-stepping carcinomas cell by 
cell by cell. But the Hinnerangi were 
thorough. They purged Alfieri of 
corruption. They took out his ap- 
pendix, in the bargain, and com- 
forted his liver against a lifetime of 
white Milanese wine. Then they sent 
him off to recuperate. 

He breathed alien air and watched 
moons leaping like gazelles in a 
sky of strange constellations. He put 
his hand to his throat a thousand 
times a day, to feel the newness 
there, the warmth of fresh tissue. 
He ate the meat of unknown beasts. 
He gained strength from hour to 
hour. 

At last they put him in a singulari- 
ty chamber and rammed him through 
the complexities of the Fold, and he 
returned to Halfway House. 



HALFWAY HOUSE 



105 




V uor said, “You will begin your 
work at once. This will be your 
office.” 

It was an oval room, walled with 
a living plastic that made it seem as 
warm and pink and soft as the walls 
of a womb. Beyond one wall was 
the quartz-bounded chamber used 
by those who traveled the Fold. Vuor 
showed him how to operate the 
switch that permitted viewing access 
to the chamber in either direction. 

“What will my duties be?” Al- 
fieri asked. 

“Come and tour Halfway House 
first,” said Vuor. 

Alfieri followed. It was hard to 
grasp the nature of the place; Al- 
fieri pictured it as something like a 
space station, an orbiting wheel of 
finite size divided into many cham- 
bers. But since there were no win- 
dows, he could not confirm that be- 
lief. The place seemed fairly small, 
no bigger than a good-sized office 
building. Much of it was given over 
to a power plant. Alfieri wished to 
stay and examine the generators, but 
Vuor hurried him on to a cafeteria, 
to a small room that would be his 
dwelling place, to some sort of chap- 
el, to executive offices. 

The alien seemed impatient. Si- 
lent figures drifted through the halls 
of Halfway House, beings of fifty 
sorts. Nearly all were oxygen- 
breathers who could handle the all- 
purpose atmosphere of the place, but 
some were masked and mysterious. 
They nodded at Vuor, stared at Al- 
fieri. Civil servants, Alfieri thought. 
Doing their routine work. And now 
I am one of them, a pretty bureau- 
crat. But I am alive, and I will wade 



through a sea of bureaucratic forms 
to show my gratitude. 

They returned to the oval office 
with the soft, moist pink walls. 

“What will my duties be?” Al- 
fieri asked again. 

“To interview those who come to 
Halfway House seeking to travel be- 
yond the Fold.” 

“But that’s your job!” 

“No longer,” said Vuor. “My term 
is up. Mine is the now-vacant posi- 
tion you have been recruited to fill. 
When you begin, I can leave.” 

“You said I’d get an administra- 
tive post. To organize, to plan — ” 
“This is administrative work. You 
must judge the niceties of each ap- 
plicant’s situation. You mu^t be 
aware of the capacity of the facili- 
ties beyond this point. You must 
maintain an overview of your task: 
whom to send forward, whom to re- 
ject.” 

A lfieri’s hands trembled. “I’m the 
one who’ll decide? I say, you 
go back and rot, and you come for- 
ward? I choose life for some and 
death for others? No. I don’t want 
it. I’m not God!” 

“Neither am I,” said the alien 
blandly. “Do you think I like this 
job? But now I can shrug it off. I 
am finished here. I have been God 
for five years, Alfieri. It’s your turn 
now.” 

“Give me some other work. There 
must be other jobs suited for me!” 
“Perhaps there are. But you are 
best suited for this one. You are a 
gifted decider. And another thing to 
consider, Alfieri: you are my re- 
placement. If you do not take the 



106 



IF 




job, I must remain until someone 
else capable of handling it is found. 
I have been God long enough, Al- 
fieri.” 

Alfieri was silent. He stared into 
the golden eyeslits, and for the first 
time he thought he could interpret 
an expression he found there. Pain. 
The pain of an Atlas, carrying worlds 
on his shoulders. Vuor was suffer- 
ing. And he, Franco Alfieri, could 
alleviate that pain by taking the 
burden on himself. 

Vuor said, “When your applica- 
tion was approved, there was an un- 
derstanding that you would render 
service to us. The scope of your du- 
ties has been outlined to you. There 
is an obligation, Alfieri.” 

Nodding, Alfieri saw the truth of 
that. If he refused to take the post, 
what would they do? Give him his 
cancer back? No. They would find 
another use for him. And Vuor 
would continue to hold this job. Al- 
fieri owed his life to the suffering 
alien. If he extended Vuor’s duties 
by one additional hour, it would be 
unforgivable. 

“I accept the obligation,” Alfieri 
said. 

The look in the alien eyeslits could 
have been nothing but joy. 

T here Avere certain things Alfieri 
had to learn about his job, and 
then he was on his own. He learned 
them. He took up his new existence 
as a bureaucrat with good grace. 
One room to live in, instead of a 
cycle of mansions; food prepared by 
computers, not by master chefs; a 
long day of work, and little recre- 
ation. But he was alive. He could 



look to a time beyond the five years. 

He sent word to Earth that he 
would be detained and that he would 
eventually return in good health to 
resume his position in the corpora- 
tion. He authorized the commence- 
ment of Plan A for running the com- 
pany in his prolonged absence. Al- 
fieri had planned everything.. Men 
he trusted would be stewards for him 
until he returned. It wa.s made quite 
clear to him at Halfway House that 
he could not attempt to run the 
firm by remote control, and so he 
activated his plan and left the com- 
pany to its new administrators. He 
was busy enough. 

Applicants came to him. 

Not all of them wished medical 
aid, but all had some good and 
compelling reason for journeying to 
some world beyond the Fold. Alfieri 
judged their cases. He had no quota; 
if he cared to, he could send all his 
applicants through to their destina- 
tions or turn them* all away. But the 
one would be irresponsible, the other 
inhumane. Alfieri judged. He 
weighed in the balance, and some 
he found wanting, and others he 
passed on. There were only so many 
channels, a finite number of routes 
to the infinity of worlds. Alfieri 
thought of himself sometimes as a 
traffic policeman, sometimes as Max- 
well’s Demon, sometimes as Rhada- 
manthus in Hades. Mostly he thought 
of the day when he could go home 
again. 

The refusals were painful. Some 
of the applicants bellowed their rage 
at him and made threats. Some of 
them shrank into sobbing stupors. 
Some quietly warned of the grave 



HALFWAY HOUSE 



107 




injustice he was doing. Alfieri had 
made hard decisions all his life, but 
his soul was not yet calloused from 
them, and he regretted the things 
the applicants said to him. The job, 
though, had to be done, and he could 
not deny he had a gift for it. 

He was not the only such judge 
at Halfway House, naturally. Streams 
of applicants were constantly pro- 
cessed through many offices. But Al- 
fieri was, in addition to a judge, the 
final court of appeals for his col- 
leagues. He maintained the overview. 
He controlled the general flow. It 
was his talent to administer things. 

A day came when an auburn- 
skinned being with swarming 
subdivided tendrils stood before him, 
a man of Hinnerang. For a terrible 
moment Alfieri thought it was the 
surgeon who had repaired his throat. 
But the resemblance was only super- 
ficial. This man was no surgeon. 

Alfieri said, “This is Halfway 
House.” 

“I need help. I am Tomrik Hori- 
man. You have my dossier?” 

“I do,” Alfieri said. “You know 
that we give no help here, Tomrik 
Horiman. We simply forward you 
to the place where help may be ob- 
tained. Tell me about yourself.” 

The tendrils writhed in anguish. 
“I am a grower of houses. My cap- 
ital is overextended. My entire estab- 
lishment is threatened. If I could go 
to a world where my houses would 
win favor, my firm would be saved. 
I have a plan for growing houses on 
Melknor. Our calculations show that 
there would be a demand for our 
product there.” 



“Melknor has no shortage of 
houses,” Alfieri remarked. 

“But they love novelty there. 
They’d rush to buy. An entire fam- 
ily is faced with ruin, kind sir! Root 
and branch we will be wiped out. 
The penalty for bankruptcy is ex- 
treme. With my honor lost, I would 
have to destroy myself. I have chil- 
dren.” 

Alfieri knew that. He also knew 
that the Hinnerangi spoke the truth; 
unless he were allowed to pass 
through to Melknor to save his busi- 
ness, he would be obliged to take his 
own life. As much as Alfieri him- 
self, this being had come before the 
tribunal of Halfway House under a 
death sentence. 

But Alfieri had gifts. What did 
this man offer? He wished to sell 
houses on a planet that had no real 
need for them. He was one of many 
such house-growers, anyway, and 
a poor businessman to boot. He had 
brought his troubles upon himself, 
unlike Alfieri, who had not asked 
for his cancer. Nor would Tomrik 
Horiman’s passing be any great loss 
except to his immediate family. It 
was a great pity; but the application 
would have to be refused. 

4 4TXTe will give you our de- 
VV cision shortly,” said Alfieri. 
He opaqued the walls and briefly 
reported to his colleagues. They did 
not question the wisdom of his de- 
cision. Clearing the walls, he stared 
through the blocks of quartz at the 
man from Hinnerang and said, “I 
greatly regret that your application 
must be rejected.” 

Alfieri waited for the reaction. 



108 



IF 




Anger? Hysterical denunciation? Des- 
pair? Cold fury? A paroxysm of 
frustration? 

No, none of those. The merchant 
of vegetary houses looked quietly 
back at Alfieri, who had spent 
enough time among Hinnerangi to 
interpret their unvoiced emotions. 
And Alfieri felt the flood of sorrow 
coming at him like a stream of acid. 
Tomrik Horiman pitied hin>. 

“I am very sorry,” the Hinnerangi 
said. “You bear such a great bur- 
den.” 

Alfieri shook with the pain of the 
words. The man was sorry — not for 
himself, but for him! Morbidly, he 
almost wished for his cancer back. 
Tomrik Horiman’s pity was more 
than he could bear at that moment. 

Tomrik Horiman gripped the rail 
and stood poised for his return to 
his own world. For an instant his 
eyes met the shadowed ones of the 
Earthman. 

“Tell me,” Tomrik Horiman said. 
“This job you have, deciding who 
goes forward, who goes back. Such a 
terrible burden! How did this job 
come to you?” 

“I was condemned to it,” said 
Franco Alfieri in all the anguish of 
his Godhead. “The price for my life 
was my life. I never knew such 
suffering, when I was only a dying 
man.” 

He scowled. And then he threw 
the switch that sent Tomrik Horiman 
away. END

now and then in the process!

I drove home first, taking Jota 
with me, for he insisted we 
should change into dank dotflies. 

We knew the place where the 
camp must be: *7n a bend on the 
river about a mile upstream,** It was 



a piece of wasteland which camp- 
ers had used before, but not often, 
because modern campers had cars 
or cjiravans or bicycles or trucks; 
and if they hadn’t, they wanted to 
be near a road where diey could 
catch buses. This spot was near no 
road, and anybody camping there

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



In the little town of Shuteley, England, on the hottest summer 
of any resident's memory, a party of visitors appeared. They were all 
young, and they were enormous. Moreover, they had a couple of 
traits that startled the quiet people of Shuteley. The girls in the party 
wore dresses that disappeared from time to time; and all of them hod 
an unusual knowledge of what was happening in the town . and 
what was about to happen. 

The giants had established a camp on the bank of a river out- 
side of Shuteley. Two of the inhabitants went to visit there, to satisfy 
their curiosity. 

They didn't know that the price of their curiosity would be 
their lives! 



who wanted to come into Shuteley 
had to walk all the way. 

It was a good place, perhaps the 
best place in the vicinity for camp- 
ers who wanted privacy. Yet it was 
also a place where anyone who 
wanted to spy on them could do 
so very easily. 

And yet, as I said to Iota just 
before turning into our drive: “We 
may be making fools of ourselves. 
If they knew the precise second 
when you’d walk into my office, 
don’t they know already that we’re 
on our way to spy on them?” 

Such considerations didn’t bother 
Iota. ‘Then something may de- 
velop. And that’s wbait we want.” 

I left the oar outside the house, 
and Jota took his one trunk in- 
side with him. 

Sheila met us in the hall, and 



at sight of Jota she started and 
shot a quick glance at me which 
could only be described as unfriend- 
ly. “I thought I told you — ” she 
said. 

“Sorry,” I said rather awkward- 
ly. “I knew you were going shop- 
ping. I thought you’d have left.” 

I had put it that way, because 
when we came in I knew she hadn’t 
left. Her Austin mini was still in 
the drive. 

“Hello, Sheila,” said Jota easily. 
“You look more wonderful than 
ever.” 

Sheila said nothing. She picked 
up her shopping bag and went out, 
slamming the front door. 

“You should have phoned, you 
know,” Jota told me. “Don’t you 
know anything about women? It’s 
nothing to do with whether she 



112 



IF 




loves me or hates my guts. Maybe 
she wouldn’t have prettied herself 
up anyway. You sihould have given 
her (the choice, to be here or not, 
to be dressed up or just — ” 

“Let’s change,” I said irritably. I 
didn’t want a lecture from Jota, 
of all people, on Sheila, of all 
people. 

Jota was staring past me at the 
stairs. I (turned. Dina was descend- 
ing slowly, dressed in an old pink 
evening gown of Sheila’s. 

“She saw a Goldwyn picture on 
television the other day,” I mur- 
mured. “Beautiful girls coming 
down wide staircases.” Raising my 
voice, I called: “Dina — would you 
like to go and stay with the Cars- 
wells?” 

She stopped play-acting at once, 
lifted her long skirt and ran down 
the rest of the way. “Now?” she 
said eagerly. 

“If you like.” 

She turned. “I’ll go -and pack.” 
“Wait, Dina. Aren’t you going 
to say hello to Jota?” 

“Hello,” she said and started for 
the stairs. 

“She’s lovely,” Jota said. “No 
change? I mean — ” 

“I know what you mean,” I said 
shortly. “No change.” 

“That,’' he said, “is a great pity.” 
“That,” I replied, “is an under- 
statement.” 

“What I mean is — ” 

“I know what you mean.” 

He seemed to feel I should be 
more forthcoming. “Naturally I’m 
interested,” he said. “Dina’s my 
cousin.” 

I added nothing, however, and 
the subject was dropped. 



T he probable camp site being on 
(the other side of the river, we 
rowed (across the placdd Shute in 
a rubber dinghy. Sddom used, the 
boat was invaluable at times, the 
nearest bridge being at Shutdey. 

We made a considerable detour 
in order to be able to approach the 
place where we expected the camp 
to be from the far side, and we 
stopf>ed talking as we neared the 
spot. Sound can carry unexpectedly 
in the open, especially near water. 

Of course Jota, Gil and I had 
played as (kids all around Shuteley, 
and the countryside had changed 
less than the town — which hadn’t 
changed much. There were some 
places where we knew every bush, 
every tree and every stone, and this 
was one of them. 

Along the riverside east of the 
probable camp site there was a jun- 
gle of undergrowth. It was through 
this that we approached. A slight 
breeze rustled the leaves and cloaked 
any noise we might have made. 

The camp was exactly where we 
expected — and the giants didn’t 
know we were there. At least, if 
they did they were pretending they 
didn’t, and that seemed out of char- 
acter. 

At first sight their camp was like, 
any other. There were two large 
tents and five small ones. Most of 
the boys and girls I had already 
seen were there, and there were 
some I was sure I hadn’t seen. The 
sixteen who had been in The Cop- 
]>er Beech the evening before, plus 
Greg, were not, therefore, the whole 
company. 

In the shade of a canopy two girls 
were reading magazines. Four of 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS

the men lay on the grass sunbath- 
ing, and on the other side of the 
big tents, three girls lay drowsily 
in the afternoon heat. Two or three 
more sat on the river bank, not 
bathing, merely dangling their toes 
in the water. 

Two who were missing were Mir- 
anda and Greg. The chance link pro- 
duced a sudden stab of jealousy in 
me. Was Miranda Greg’s girl? 

Such things happened. They kept 
happening. A girl talked as if a 
certain man was, as far as she was 
concerned, the person least likely 
to succeed. And then you found 
out . 

On the face of it, Miranda didn’t 
like Jota much and liked Greg less. 
But I knew that any vague ideas I 
might have about Miranda and me 
— adolescent fantasies, anyway, fat- 
uous even if I weren’t married to 
Sheila — were going to be over- 
turned by Greg or Jota, if not both. 
I knew this because such things al- 
ways happened. It was in the na- 
ture of things. 

Anyway, the camp presented a 
very normal scene. I didn’t know 
what Jota had expected, but I hadn’t 
exj>ected this. Not when the giants 
didn’t know we were watching 
them. 

We could see very well. We were 
unlikely to be detected; but unfor- 
tunately we were too far away to 
pick up any of the lazy, murmured 
conversations of either group of 
sunbathers. 

And after five minutes I was more 
than ready to leave. I was rather 
afraid that Jota was going to force 
the issue by striding into the camp 



and making something happen. Un- 
certain why I didn’t want that, I 
was nevertheless certain that it 
would 'be a mistake. 

Every single person in the camp 
was dressed exactly as might be ex- 
pected. Nothing sensational like the 
luxon dresses was visible, and that 
was puzzling. If the giants didn’t 
mind creating a sensation in Shute- 
ley, why were they so conventional 
in their own camp? 

Did they know we were watching 
them, after all? 

The tents, too, were straightfor- 
ward. Primus stoves, plastic contain- 
ers, buckets, basins — every item of 
camping equipment I could see look- 
ed standard. 

That crystallized one of the things 
that puzzled me about the giants. 
If their origin was as strange as I 
suspected, one of two things could 
have been expected. 

Either they’d make quite certain 
their clothes, money, appearance, 
speech, camping equipment and 
everything else they had with them 
were authentic. Or, careless of what 
Shuteley thought of them, they’d 
appear in their true colors — which 
were, I was quite certain, vastly 
different from anything we had ever 
seen. 

But they steered a baffling middle 
course. 

At last what I feared came about. 
“Come on,” said Jota in a normal 
tone and moved forward. 

“No,” I whispered urgently, try- 
ing to hold him back. 

“They’re ordinary kids or they’re 
not,” he said. “Let’s talk to them 
and find out.”

IF 




Reluctantly I followed him, and 
we strode into the camp. 

N o, they hadn’t been expecting 
us. The sunbathers sat up, 
startled, one of the girls who had 
unfastened the strap of her bra 
holding a towel in front of her. 

“Greg!” somebody shouted, and 
Greg emerged from one of the tents. 
I wondered: was Miranda in there? 

“Hi,” said Greg casually, coming 
to meet us. 

All the giants gathered together — 
and they were giants, seen in this 
setting. Nobody was fat, but the 
vital statistics of both boys and girls 
were unusual. Average figures 
among the girls, I calculated, would 
be 41-27-40. Scaled down, very sat- 
isfactory. But they had to stand 
back for the full effect to be made. 

There was no pretense that we 
were anything but unwelcome visit- 
ors. Someone whisipered to Greg, 
and then he faced us. 

“So you came to spy on us, Val,” 
Greg said. “Iota’s idea, I guess.” He 
said “Iota” this time, not “Clarence 
Mulliner.” 

“We simply came to — ’’ 

“Fft,” said Greg derisively, point- 
ing. I followed his glance. His 
meaning and Jiis conclusion were 
unmistakable. Wc had come from 
dense undergrowth. Nobody openly 
approaching the camp would ever 
have come that way 

WTiile my head was turned he 
must have made a gesture. Before we 
could move we were each in the 
grasp of two of the most gigantic 
of giants. 

From that moment I ceased 



thinking of the giants as kids. When 
two of them could hold Iota and I 
as those four held us, they were 
men. 

“A duel,” said Greg. “No, two 
duels. That’s it.” 

There was an excited hum among 
the giants. 

Iota’s silence surprised me. He 
was seldom at a loss for w.ords. 

“Knives or guns,” said Greg. 
“1*11 take Iota.. Obviously. Wesley, 
you can have Val.” 

They began to form a ring. One 
of the girls ran into Greg’s tent 
and emerged almost at once with 
a pair of wicked-looking knives and 
two old-fashioned dueling pistols in 
a case. 

“This has gone far enough,” I 
said. “Where’s Miranda?” 

“She isn’t here,” Greg said. And 
the way he said it made me certain 
that her absence completely left him 
off the leash, that he felt free to 
do things he might not otherwise 
have dared do. 

In a daze I saw Iota calmly elect 
to fight with the pistols. His idea 
was to play along with the giants, 
see how far they would go. Per- 
haps he was right, I thought. On 
his own, without any conventional 
reaction, he’d possibly have been 
able to get himself accepted on his 
own terms as usual. 

The giants played out the farce 
gravely, though with suppressed ex- 
citement. One of them offered him- 
self as lota’s second. 

Then Greg said, not to us but 
to the rest of them: “This really is 
a test. This really is worth while. 
Tm taking Iota.” He stopped, the 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



115

pause heavy with signifioaoce, al- 
though what the significance might 
be was a compiete mystery to us. 
He went on: “So after t!^ weH 
ah know, won’t we?” 

A wave of uneastiness ran through 
them. All the gids stood well back. 
Then we got on with it. The pis- 
tols were inspected, the meeting- 
ground paced out. Then Gieg and 
Iota stood back to back and at a 
signal began to stride slowly and 
steadily apart. 

They had not let me be Iota’s 
second. I had therefore had no 
chance to' examine the pistols. They 
would, of course, be loaded with 
blanks. Perhaps they were not real- 
ly pistols at all, but cigarette lighters 
or elaborate toys. 

I couldn’t take the affair serious- 
ly, and I was sure Iota wasn’t do- 
ing so either, because it was obvious 
that the giants were simply playing 
at duels. There had been a chill 
for a moment as Greg made his lit- 
tle speech, but already those not 
directly involved were smiling and 
laughing, as if this was all a big 
joke. 

Iota and Greg took their last 
paces and turned. The two shots were 
so close that it was impossible to 
tell which was first. Iota’s, I thought, 
buit of course he had deloped — 
fired in the air. Crazy though he 
might 'be at times, he wasn’t tak- 
ing the chance of really shooting 
Greg. 

But Greg had not deloped. And 
incredulously I watched Iota sink to 
his knees, blood at his mouth. 

When we reached him he was 
dead. 



I don’t know what 1 said and did. 
Ifie rest was nightmare. 
F^^agments of thought flashed 
through my mind. One was that if 
our world really was nothing to the 
giants, murder in it didn’t count 
to them. If to -them we were un- 
real, they could kill us as we’d shoot 
clay pipes. Was that -the explana- 
tion? 

I also thought of the. incredible 
manner of lota’s death. He had 
always seemed larger than life. Yet 
at the end, he died grotesquely — 
firing in the air, quite certain the 
duel was a piece of juvenile play- 
acting, letting Greg pick him off. 

I wondered if Miranda’s presence 
would have made any difference. 
Would she have stood hack with 
the rest of the girls? Or would she, 
having spoken to me three times 
and lunched with me, have felt what 
none of the others seemed to feel 
— that we were human beings? I 
had to admit she had never shown 
any sign of it. 

I noticed then, though I was un- 
able to analyze it until later, that 
Greg had proved a point. The -giants 
were looking at him now with new 
respect. No, not respect. Rather 
caution and apprehension. Why this 
should he I didn’t know. The reason 
had to he something more than that 
he had proved he could shoot 
straight. Perhaps it was because he 
had proved he could kill. 

Incredibly, in the middle of this, 
they were making me choose 
we^jpons. Greg was telling me — 
the sense registered, though the 



116 



IF 




words did not — that if I won, I was 
free to go. 

“Killer,” I whispered. 

“We’re all killers,” he said in- 
differently. “You’re a meat eater.” 

“Are you going to eat Jota?” I 
demanded. 

“That’s a point,” he admitted 
and gropved mentally. “A hit — a 
palpable hit,” he added. 

Realizing that this much was real, 
that I had to fight Wesley and he 
would kill me if he could, I chose 
the knives. Pistols were no use. 
Greg had shown he could shoot, 
and no doubt Wesley could too. I 
didn’t know I couldn’t, but I was 
fairly sure, never having tried. 

Wesley was taller than me but 
not much heavier. Although some 
of the protocol of duello had been 
observed, no one had said anything 
about dress. I still wore dark pants 
and a dark sweater, and Wesley, in 
swimming briefs, evidently intended 
to start that way. 

We started fighting. In the first 
two seconds Wesley slashed my left 
wrist deeply and painfully, and 
nothing could have brought home 
to me more clearly that I was fight- 
ing for my life. 

I knew this was a nightmare, I 
knew it wasn’t real to the giants, 
and yet it had been real to Jota, 
and it was real to me. 

So I feinted. I slid under that 
terrifying blade, and before I got 
clear again I slashed Wesley’s leg. 
It was a fearsome cut, and it near- 
ly made me sick. The giants shout- 
ed and screamed with excitement. 

I had tried to tell Greg that we 



couldn’t kill them, that the death 
of Jota had been murder because 
Jota couldn’t possibly try to kill 
him. And if I killed one of the 
giants, the police would see it only 
as murder. 

But if I didn’t kill Wesley, he 
would kill me. This I now fully 
accepted. ^ 

The slashed leg hampered him 
considerably. Faster than me until 
then, he had shown no particular 
skill with a knife. But then, I had 
none either. 

He attacked me twice and I 
dodged him, making him waste en- 
ergy and lose blood. And now he 
knew that he could lose this fight 
— I saw it in his eyes. With every 
moment he was slower and weaker. 

I got him again. Although the 
slash across his chest did no serious 
damage, it made him a gory ob- 
ject, with rich blood welling from 
his leg on the grass and long 
streaks running down his torso. 

It was his blood that nearly fin- 
ished me. I slipped on it, and he was 
on me, the knife high. 

Too high. Never having fought 
with a knife, anymore than I had, 
he paid for the dramatic gesture, 
knife raised at arm’s-length for the 
death stroke. 

I cut his legs from under him 
and as he fedl pressed the knife 
into his heart. It was torn from 
my fingers. 

Unfortunately for all of us, he 
didn’t die quite as quickly as Jota had 
done ... 

“All right, Vail,” Greg said sob- 
erly, “you can go.” 

They were all sober now, the ex- 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



117 




ci'tement ifading from their faces. 
Some of the giiis looked rather sick. 

I tunned and walked out of the 
camp. What I was going to do now, 
I had no idea. The giants had killed 
Jota, and I’d killed one of them. 

Of one thing, somehow, I was 
certain. The giants would cover up. 
If I went to the police and took 
them back to the camp, there would 
be no sign of Jota or of Wesley. The 
blood would be gone . 

J ota and I were striding into the 
camp! 

For a moment we faltered and 
stared at each other. Then Greg, 
enjoying himself, was saying: “No 
argument, please. Just get out.” 
Grinning at me in a not unfriend- 
ly way was Wesley. Alive. And I 
knew from his expression that the 
duels were something more than a 
figment of imagination. He looked 
exactly as if I had beaten him, fair 
and square, in any contest, and he 
was ready to admit it. 

But there was no blood. He was 
unscratched, as I was. 

It wasn’t quite the same as the 
last time we had entered the camp. 
This time they were expecting us, 
lined up. The sunbathers were there 
too, on their feet. The shy girl had 
fastened her bra. 

In a second sense, Jota came to 
life. “No,” he said. ‘Td like to stay 
here with -you. In fact, I will.” 
Greg frowned. “That was meant 
as a warning. If you — ” 

“I’m warned,” said Jota easily. 
“Now, I’d like to stay with you for 
a while. I’ll be no bother. I’ve 
camped out often.” 



All the giants seemed taken aback. 

“I’ll even promise not to ask 
questions,” Jota said. “Gosh, it’s 
hot.” He started taking off his 
jacket. 

“We’ll throw you out,” said Greg. 

“And I’ll come back,” Jota said. 
“I came back from the dead, didn’t 
I?” 

“We arranged that,” said Greg 
ominously. “Next time we won’t 
loop you back.” 

Jota had his jacket off and was 
unbuttoning his shirt. /‘Oan some- 
one lend me a pair of shorts?” he 
asked. 

Greg suddenly laughed — the bel- 
low that had rattled the windows 
of my office. “I like you,” he said. 

“Most people do,” said Jota. 

“You’re a bit like me,” said Greg. 

“In more ways than one,” said 
Jota softly. And now he was speak- 
ing with significance. 

There was a sudden silence. Jota 
knew something he wasn’t supposed 
to know. 

I was out of this, yet not entire- 
ly out of it, not without some clue. 
I had known Jota a long time. 

“Remember,” Greg said, “I killed 
you.” 

“Remember,” Jota said, “I let 
you.” 

They suddenly all decided by 
common consent that if Jota was 
halfway one of them, I certainly 
wasn’t. can’t stay,” Greg told 
Jota. 

“That’s all right,” said Jota calm- 
ly. “I don’t need anyone to hold 
my hand.” 

They were going to let him stay. 
He was going to have his way. 



118 



IF 




as usual. And I knew he’d had this 
idea in his head all along. 

Jota, despite a wide variety of 
personal contacts that were fleet- 
ing or lasting, was a lone wolf. He 
didn’t want me with him. He want- 
ed to do this his way. 

“What’s your name?” he asked 
one of the girls, the prettiest next 
to Miranda. 

“Irwina,” she said. 

“Let’s go and dangle our toes in 
the water — after somebody lends 
me a pair of shorts.” 

Greg looked at me. “Get out,” 
he said briefly. 

I didn’t argue. Jota, living in the 
camp, was bound to learn a lot — 
perhaps everything there was to 
learn. 

I walked away and left them. 

I t was quicker to walk back along 
the river bank than it would have 
been to cut across country to the 
road into town. 

There was no point in going 
back to the office. I knew I couldn’t 
do anything useful that afternoon. 
Fighting for your life, even if you 
win, doesn’t leave you cool, calm 
and collected. 

To say I was shaken was an un- 
derstatement. Unharmed, unscratoh- 
ed though I 'was, I had lived the 
nightmare. Jota had died, and yet 
he had experienced less than I had. 
I could still feel the pain in my 
wrist, the warm dripping blood. I 
would never forget what it was like 
to fight for my life, knowing the 
only choice was to kill or be killed. 
Nor would I forget what it was like 
to be a killer. 



If I ever killed again, there would 
have to be a reason, a stronger 
reason even than self-defense. Until 
then I had not realized Hhere could 
be a st^on^ge^ reason. Yet if you 
kill merely to avoid beinlg killed, 
you don’t want to !kill. If you kill 
in anger or bate, you mean it . 

I was going home to have a ^iff 
whisky, or two, or three. SSieila was 
out. And Dina would have gone to 
the Carswells. 

I was glad Sheila wouldn’t be at 
home. If a man and womian are 
close, married or not, everything 
that happens has to be shared, and 
as soon as possible. Once Fd have 
been running home to tdl Sheila 
what had happened, to talk it out 
with her. As it was I was impa- 
tient to get into a cool, daricened 
room, out of the sun, with a glass 
and a bottle of Glen Grant. 

I meant to get drunk. Yet I don’t 
drink a lot, and seldom alone. 

Ahead of me, I saw a swimmer in 
the river. And what a swiniimer! She 
was moving away, gaining on me. 
She must therefore have slipped into 
the water, unnoticed, just in front 
of me. 

Although I could see only her 
dark head, she must be Miranda. 
Nobody in Shuteley could swim like 
that . 

I guessed at once where she was 
going. 

When three or six or a dozen 
out of the ordinary things happen 
at more or less the same time, the 
chances of a connection between 
them are overwheJming. Miranda 
was swimming downriver. She 
wasn’t swimming lazily, as anyone 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



119 




might on a hot day. She was swim- 
ming with a purpose, to get some- 
where. 

About half a mile downriver, on 
the south side, was the copse where 
I had seen the unexplained, inex- 
plicable radiance. And short of go- 
ing all the way to Shuteley, crossing 
there, coming back on the other 
side and then walking up our drive, 
past the house and through the gar- 
den, the only way to reach it from 
the giants’ camp was to swim or use 
a boat. 

I started to run. I wanted to be 
in the copse before Miranda, to hide 
and see what happened. Unless I ran 
I had no chance of beating her there, 
because I had to run past the copse 
to where Jota and I had left the 
dinghy, row myself over and get 
mysd'f established in the copse be- 
fore Miranda arrived. 

I made it. I was across the river 
and well hidden at the bottom of 
the garden just before Miranda 
swam up the first inside leg of the 
W bend. 

I saw her climb onto the bank, 
shaking the water from her hair . 
then she said, not loudly: “Come 
out, Val.” 

XII 

T here was no point in going on 
pretending. I stood up, pushed 
my way through the bushes, and 
joined her on the small strip of 
grass at the edge of the river, 

“You saw me?” I said. 

“I saw your boat.” 

At the point where I crossed, 
only a tiny stretch of river past the 



bends was visible. By a piece of bad 
luck, Miranda must have been ex- 
actly at that pK>int when I was row- 
ing myself across. 

She sat down on the grass. Her 
swimsuit was a brief, white two-piece, 
and I had never seen anything so 
lovely as she in it. Not sexy — that, 
too, of course, but she was genuine- 
ly beautiful rather than provocative. 
“Where were you?” she asked. 

I sat down too. “At the camp. 
With Jota.” 

“What happened?” 

I told her. 

For a moment she was furiously 
angry, though silent — the first 
time I had seen her really alive. But 
all she said was: “That Greg . 
of course he’ll ruin everything. We 
knew that. Everybody knew that.” 
“Ruin what?” I asked. 

She ignored that. “And in this 
crazy duel, Jota just died?” 

“He fired his gun in the air.” 

She nodded. “That figures.” 

“He said — and everybody seem- 
ed to make sense of it hut me — 
he let Greg kill him.” 

She nodded. 

“But . that’s ridiculous. I 
mean, Jota didn’t know the clock 
was going to be put hack. He didn’t, 
I’m certain. So why would he . .?” 
‘That’s not what he meant.” 
“Greg used the word ‘loop’ .... 
‘Next time we won’t loop you 
back.’ ” 

She sighed. 

“It’s some kind of time warp, ob- 
viously,” I said. “The same thing 
that enables you to be here, when 
anyone can see you were born in 
some other century.” 



120 



IF 




Miranda said: “Val, please give 
up. I’ve told you a few iinimportaiit 
things. There aren’t many unkniport- 
ant things left that I can teiU you. 
But if you promise to stop fishing, 
we can talk if you like.” 

An idea stirred in my mind as 
I noticed that even in a bikini she 
managed to be more elegant than 
a Paris model. 

I had, of course, no intention of 
stopping fishing. What I wanted to 
do was pull this beautiful fish so 
far out of water that, gasping for 
breath, she’d tell me what I wanted 
to know 'before I let her off the 
hook. It might not be possible, but 
I meant to try. 

H er white two-piece was already 
quite dry. Her pale, creamy 
skin had already stopped steaming, 
and only her damp hair showed that 
she had been in the water a few 
minutes ago. 

Until that moment I had thought 
a bikini was just a bikini, and a 
girl wearing one was not so much 
dressed as censored. But Miranda’s 
two-piece was subtle . the bra, 
with shaped straps, not too small, 
concealed and revealed her thought- 
fully and tastefully, as if a talented 
artist had painstakingly drawn and 
redrawn the lines until his critical 
eye was satisfied. The briefs, not 
too tiny either, harmonized with and 
complemented muscles and curves. 
Superficially similar, the white two- 
piece was actually in a completely 
different class from the brutally 
utilitarian kind of bikini which is 
merely insurance against arrest. 
“Well?” she said. “Shall I turn 



round so that you can inspect the 
other side too?” 

“I’m thinking,” I said. “Suppose a 
girl from the seventeenth century 
were here now. Just an ordinary 
pretty girl, not the daughter of a 
duke. She probably wouldn’t be very 
clean. She would have bad teeth. 
Her face would b e marked "with 
smalli>ox and maybe worse things. 
Makeup, if any, would be crude. 
Scars, not properly treated, would 
mar her skin.” 

Miranda was listening so intently 
that I was encouraged. 

“Her clothes would be old, im- 
perfectly washed with poor soap, 
or no soap at all. They’d fit only 
approximately. If there was a bit 
of cleavage, it would be unsubtle, 
almost as if she’d forgotten to put 
something on. Am I making sense?” 

“I’m listening,” said Miranda. 

“A girl of today,”^ I said, “can 
make far more of herself without 
really trying. There’s plenty of clean 
water and good soap, and in this 
part of the world we’ve beaten the 
insect problem. She wears new or 
nearly new clothes, and they fit. 
Underneath she can wear lightweight 
machinery that does a marvelous 
job on what Nature forgot to do. All 
kinds of make-up are available, if 
she^happens to know how to use it, 
and she doesn’t have to have bad 
teeth. However. ...” 

I paused. But Miranda said noth- 
ing. 

“After another century or two,” 
I said, “purely technical things like 
better materials and seamless joints 
will be taken for granted. As well 
as that, though, experience in de- 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS

sign should count for something. Oh, 
I know none of you would wear the 
clothes you’ve (been wearing here 
back where you came from, any 
more than a girl from my office 
would go around in 1666 dressed as 
she is now. But if she went back — ” 
“Don’t labor it,” said Miranda. 
“You’ve made your point.” 

“What puzzles me,” I said, “is 
your curious compromise. I mean, 
everything I saw in the camp looked 
right. You’ve all got your hair cut 
the right way. Yet just this morn- 
ing, when you wore a pink suit that 
would otherwise have been perfectly 
all right for Shuteley High Street, 
it was made of luxon.” 

“Well . that was a mistake.” 

“I thought only Greg made mis- 
takes.” 

Rather sharply she said: “It’s 

not mistakes Greg makes. Some of 
the things he does he means. Others 
he just doesn’t care about. A mis- 
take is something you’d take back 
if you had the chance. Greg wouldn’t 
take anything back.” 

“But he just did. He looped Jota 
back.” 

She decided to surrender on that, 
yielding on one more thing that 
didn’t matter too much. 

“Loop equipment is small and 
light, and the effect is purely local,) 
she said. “There isn’t supposed to be 
a set at the camp, but apparently 
someone’s gqt one. I’ll have to do 
something about that.” 

“Just minor gadgetry,” I said. 
“Like luxon. Nothing more.” 

S he looked at me sharply, wonder- 
ing, as she seemed to have done 



once or twice, if I was possibly 
not as primitively moronic as I was 
supposed to be. 

^e told me a htUe more about 
the loop technique, and I realized 
that I’d ibeen pretty near the mark. 
To her, it was minor, unremarkable, 
which was why she told me about 
it. In much the same way I might 
have tried to explain a zip fastener 
to a girl of the seventeenth century. 

When a small, local disaster oc- 
curred, you snuffed it out of exis- 
tence. If an axe slipped and slashed 
your leg, you snapped back a few 
seconds and avoids the accident. If 
a car carelessly reversed at a har- 
bor, plunged into the dock, you 
took the careless moments back and 
braked before the car went over 
the edge. If you dropped a precious 
vase and it shattered in a thousand 
fragments, you turned the second 
band back md didn’t drop the vase. 

It was a useful but very ordinary 
technique, possibly more significant 
than paper clips, zip fasteners, safe- 
ty pins, and cigarette lighters, but 
not to be classed with things like 
the (transistor radio, television or 
atomic energy . she thought. 

And it occurred to me for the 
first time that Miranda was no 
genius, merely an ordinary girl of 
her time, fairly intelligent but no 
deep thinker. 

“Another thing,” I said. “Food is 
just food. The quality doesn’t mat- 
ter. Now that’s a real surprise. All 
the indications are that people will 
become more choosy, not less. But 
the expected doesn’t always come 
about. I could make a guess .

food supply more and more diffi-

food as merely fuel. To eat enough 
but not too much. To be healthy, 
to avoid anything grossing, never 
to get fat and never to regard food 
as an end in itself.” 

Miranda refused to react, so I 
prodded her again. “So you do come 
from the future. Despite all pro- 
testations.” 

She lay right back on the grass. 
“We’re from the present,” she said 
with finality. 

“That means vs^e're in the past. 
Your time is the real time. We’re 
ancient, ignorant, dead savages. 
That’s why we’re not real. That’s 
why our problems, our lives, don’t 
matter. That’s why the disaster that’s 
going to happen in the next few 
hours is going to be merely an 
interesting spectacle. That’s why, 
though you give as little as pK>ssi- 
ble away, you talk with us as I 
might talk to some ignorant civilian 
Trojan, not even a soldier, who 
hasn’t the faintest suspicion that 
the great wooden horse is full of 
men. If we’re not too unimportant 
to talk to, we’re too stupid.” 

She was sitting up again, startled. 
She was brfeathing deeply and sud- 
denly flushed. 

What I had done I didn’t know. 
But whatever it was, it took effect 
— as if I, a foreigner, had sud- 
denly spoken to her in her own 
language; or as if I’d kissed her 
the way Iota, no doubt, could have 
done. 



XIII 

S he didn’t say anything, yet I knew 
that I had got through to her. 
And I knew that Miranda was no 
longer a thousand miles or years 
out of my reach. 

I leaned over and kissed her light- 
ly. She did^ nothing. I kissed her 
. again, more insistently, more de- 
mandingly. 

“Let’s go up to the ’house,” ^e 
said, pushing me away. “Sheila can’t 
be there, or you woudn’t be acting 
this way. I’m thirsty.” 

“So,” I said, “am I. You might 
as well come up to the house, since 
you can’t do what you were going 
to do here with me around, can 
you?” 

“No,” she admitted and smiled. 
It was the first real smile I’d had 
from her. 

In the house, I tried to make her 
drink whisky, from ancient mo- 
tives. But she wanted lemonade. It 
seemed to startle her w'hen I put ice 
in it. Evidently this prehistoric meth- 
od of chilling drinks was strange 
to her. 

Standing in bare feet and a white 
bikini on the deep carpet of the 
lounge, she was out of place in 
a dozen ways. Although I had drawn 
the curtains in case anyone hap- 
pened to look through the window, 
I was uneasy. “Would you like to 
borrow a dress?” I said. “If Sheila’s 
things are too big for you, Dina’s 
might fit. 

“No, thanks,” she said. “I’ll 
swim back.” A thought struck her. 
“Who’s she?” 

“My sister.” 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS

I wasn’t telling her, I was re- 
mlmding her. She must know about 
Bima. 

But she didn’t. It showed. 

And I was startled. How could 
she 'know what she knew and not 
know about Dina? 

I started asking questions again. 
“You didn’t know about Dina? You 
didn’t even know she existed? Yet 
you knew Jota would meet me at 
3:10 this afternoon.” 

“Did I?” 

“Greg did. And you wanted to 
meet him . you arrived precise- 
ly on cue.” 

‘Tell me about Dina.” 

“Do you know about my moth- 
er?” 

“Something . she’s sick, isn’t 
she?” 

“If you want to use a euphemism, 
yes.” 

“And Dina?” 

“Sick too — using the same 
euphemism. Pretty, healthy, stable 
in her way. But that’s the way of a 
child. That’s how she’ll stay.” 

“I wonder.” 

“What do you mean, you won- 
der?” 

She sat on a couch, drawing up 
her legs. “You’re not sick — in 
that way.” 

“If I am, I hope it doesn’t show. 
But Sheila and I have no chil- 
dren.” 

“Why not?” 

“D<Mi’t be dense.” 

“I think you’re wrong. I think 
your children would be normal.” 
“And their children?” 

She shrugged. “You know the 
difference between heredity and en- 



vironment. If environment, illness, 
anything like that was the cause of 
what happened to your mother — ” 
“It can’t be.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because of Dina.” 

She questioned me briefly hut 
rather thoroughly about my mother, 
about Dina, about me. 

Presently she smiled, and her 
smile was warmer now. “I knew 
you were sorry for yourself, Val,” 
she said. “It shows. I didn’t know 
you had so many good excuses for 
being sorry for yourself.” 

“Excuses?” I said. 

“Oh, sure. Even if you’re no psy- 
chologist, you know that self-pity 
is self-destruction. If you’ve only 
one leg and everybody else has two 
— too bad, but self-pity can only 
make your situation worse.” 

‘Thanks for the lecture,” I said. 
She smiled. “Don’t do that,” she 
said. “That’s self-defense. You’re 
putting up a barrier. It’s not in the 
least necessary, because I’m not try- 
ing to psychoanalyze you. ...” 
“What else are you doing?” 

S he got up again and began to 
move about. I tried not to watch 
her, because she affected me almost 
as she would affect a lusty seven- 
teen-year-old boy who had been in 
solitary confinement for a year. Yet 
it was impossible not to watch her. 

“This is only 1966,” she said. 
“It’s not long since psychiatry was 
born. Clever men found out many 
things which had always been as- 
sumed to be straightforward physi- 
cal ailments were actually caused by 
mental factors. And, of course, they

went tcK) far. Now almost every- 
thing short of a broken leg or 
diphtheria is supposed to be psycho- 
somatic. Quite soon now other clev- 
er men will start swinging the pendu- 
lum again. Things in the blood 
other than alcohol can cause dis- 
turbances — ” 

“Obviously,” I said. 

“And a great deal of what used 
to be called madness can be very 
simply dealt with.” 

“Loop it out of existence,” I re- 
torted. “It’s easy.” 

“No, not that ... I think there’s 
something quick and easy that could 
cure Dina. Not your mother. She 
really is psychotic. Dina is . well, 
she just needs a certain stimula- 
tion — I think. I can’t be sure. It 
depends on whether there’s anything 
fundamentally wrong in the here- 
dity line. Hers and yours.” 

“Is there a way of finding out?” 
She looked at me with sudden 
suspicion and relaxed instantly. 
“There’s a way I could find out 
about you,” she said. “And your 
children. It’s a rather curious way to 
find out such a thing . But it 
would be infallible. It would settle 
whether there was any chance of 
your passing on . what you’re 
afraid you might pass on.” 

“Will you do it?” I asked quickly. 
She smiled and looked away. 
“You don’t know what you’re ask- 
mg. 

“What do you mean?” 

“And because you don’t know 
what you’re asking . Turn around, 
Val.” 

Perhaps I was slow, but I hadn’t 
the faintest idea What was coming. 



I thought she was going to hypnotize 
me or drug me, though where she’d 
get the drugs was quite a question. 

A moment later she said: “All 
right. Turn back.” 

She was on the thick carpet, 
naked, her marvelous body twice as 
marvelous as even my heated imag- 
ination had been able to picture it. 

She held out her arms to me, yet 
like a fool I hesitated. 

“This way?” I said stupidly. 
‘This is part of it. But if you’re 
reluctant. .” 

I ran to her. 

XIV 

I had read and heard of acts of 
love which were not merely sex, 
which were more even than the con- 
summation of true love: timeless 
moments when two people met ?*nd 
were reborn. I had not believed such 
things could happen. 

I didn’t even love Miranda, and 
quite certainly she didn’t love me. 
Yet what happened then and there 
shocked us, drained us, and left us 
two different p>eople. 

Although I was aware of none 
of the details, which were unim- 
portant and probably quite conven- 
tional, I knew that she was as much 
taken aback as I was. I also vague- 
ly understood why: it was only a 
few minutes before that I had made 
her see me as something more than 
a character in a play, and now m ? 
were together with a background 
silent thunder. 

We didn’t discuss it; we didn’t 
try to explain it or explain it awav. 
It was not love, it was not passion. 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



125 




It was destiny. It was one of the 
moments, big or small, after which 
things are never quite the same 
again. 

And we recognized this, dimly, 
yet with no possdibiillty of pretense 
that nothing particular had hap- 
pened. 

Miranda’s reaction didn’t really 
surprise me, though I couldn’t un- 
derstand it. “Val,” she said soft- 
ly, ‘%vithout meaning to, I’ve done 
something more tragic than Greg 
could ever manage to do.” 

I didn’t reply. What was there 
to say to that? 

She jumped up. “You must stay 
till I come back,” she said. 

Before I could emerge from 
euphoria — which I had no par- 
ticular desire to do, anyway — she 
was gene.

I had been irritated at the irrele- You’re not going out tonight, and 

vance. Things would be different if I. Good-bye, Val.” 

I were seventy-^five feet tall, or if She ran from the room. And I

All I said was: “You had to test T)y the time Sheila drove up, twen- 
me — that way?” X3 ty minutes later, I had care- 

She nodded. “In the circum- fully removed all evidence that Mir- 

stances, it was the only way. I could anda had been in the house. I left 

my own glass where it was, but 
washed hers and put it away. 

I just didn’t know how I’d act 
and how Sheila would act after what 
happened. Not only had I been 
faithful to Sheda since we got mar- 
ried, I had been faithful to her since 
the day we met. 

After hearing her mini drive up 
and stop, I waited in the hall. Sheila 
might guess what had happened the 
moment she saw my face . Be- 
latedly I realized I should have 
found something to do, instead of 
simply standing waiting for Sheila 
with no prepared explanation of 
what I’d l^n doing all afternoon. 

She came in and said: “What’s her 
name, Val?” 

“Miranda,” I said. It would have 
been fatuous to ask what she was 
talking about, whose name she 




SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



127 




meant, and even more fatuous to 
ask how she had found out. 

“Why did you do it, Val?” Sheila 
asked quietly. She should have wait- 
ted for an answer, but she sur- 
rendered some of her advantage by 
going on: “I thought . with 
Dina out of the way for a while, 
we might have had a chance. Dina’s 
the root of afl the trouble, you 
know. All of it. You don’t think so, 
but you don’t have to put up with 
Dina at her worst, all day.” 

So we were talking afbout Dina, 
not Miranda, and the heat was tem- 
porarily off. 

“Lots of people have in-law trou- 
ble,” I said rather weakly. 

“Yes, but not this kind of trou- 
ble,” said Sheila bleakly. “If she 
was a cripple, I could speak to her 
plainly and reach some kind of 
understanding. If she wias old I 
could at least try to manage her. 
But she’s just . well, you know.” 

“I know.” 

“I hate her, Val, do you know 
that? She does. Of course she hates 
me, so we’re even. But she hated 
me first.” 

Some people could ignore dislike. 
Sheila wasn’t one of them. She 
couldn’t be indifferent. 

She went back to Miranda then, 
trying to work up the fury she had 
felt earlier. But it was too late. And 
I had realized with relief that she 
wasn’t talking about Miranda and 
me in the lounge an hour ago, but 
Miranda and me in the Red Lion 
earlier. 

“Did you have to humiliate me, 
Val?” she demanded. “Did you have 
to take her where everybody knows 



you, and me? Couldn’t you have 
taken her to some hotel out of 
town?” 

“You’ve got it wrong. Sheila,” I 
said. 

“Of course. Obviously. What else 
could be expvected? She’s a rich 
client, the daughter of the Earl of 
Shor^itoh.” 

“Skhe’s one of the giants,” I said. 

“The what? Oh, those kids. Don’t 
be ridiculous. I hear she’s about 
the same height as me.” 

“I mean, she’s with them. Listen, 
Sheila. Tliere’s something very 
strange happening here in Shuteley, 
something fantastic. This afternoon 
Jota was killed. I might have been 
killed too, but instead I killed my 
opponent — ” 

“Killed?” She stared at me. “Jota 
dead?” 

I explained what had happened. 
She listened, yet I knew I wasn’t 
getting tlirou^ to her. It wasn’t 
that she disbelieved what I said. It 
was rather that she was the kind 
of woman, the kind of womanly 
woman, who saw her own family 
and honsehold and everything that 
affected them in technicolor and 
everything else in black and white. 
The giants were all black and white, 
except Miranda, who had lunched 
with me at the Red Lion. Besides, 
she wasn’t a giant. 

I t might have made a difference to 
Sheila’s attitude, I thought, if 
Miranda had been six feet four. 
Then she’d have been a freak, and 
anything I did might have been 
laughed off as temporary aberration, 
as if I had fallen desperately in love

with the fat lady of a travdiiig cir- 
cus. 

“Anyway,” I said, “Tlieyll be 
gone tomoirrow.” 

“How do you know?” 

“I told you. Greg said — ” 

“And you believe everything 
you’re told?” 

“Sheila, these giants know things. 
One of the things . 

“Well, go on.” 

“They say,” I muttered, “that I 
needn’t worry about my children. 
That there’s no reason why they 
shouldn’t be normal. And I believe 
it’s true.” 

Sheila’s head came up quickly. 
For a moment there was radiance 
in her face. She bad fought against 
my decision, not so imuch because 
she wanted children, though she did, 
as because she believed we needed 
them. 

Then the radiance died. “Who 
told you — Miranda?’’ 

“As a matter of fact, yes.’’ 

“And anything she says is true?” 
“It’s not like that.” 

“Isn’t it?” She paused and then 
asked: “Is she very 'beautiful?” 
“Very. But she’ll be gone tomor- 
row too.” 

“So you have to make hay while 
the sun shines?” 

The phone rang. “I’ll get it,” I 
said at once, too quickly, for Sheila 
looked at me oalculatingly. Invar- 
iably she answered the phone, even 
if I was at home, because I wasn’t 
often called at home and if I was, 
her answering it gave me a chance 
to think or pretend not to be home. 

She was doing me an injustice 
this time, for the possibility that 



Miranda might be calling had not 
crossed my mind. 

It was, in fact, Jota. 

“Haven’t muc^ time,” he said. 
“I’m out for a stroll with some of 
the giants. Val, something happens 
tonight. They haven’t said any- 
thing definite — I guessed froip the 
way they talk about tomorrow, as if 
everything’s going to be. different.” 
He wasn’t telling me anything I 
didn’t know. 

“Good? Bad?” I said. 

“They’re excited. That’s all I can 
say. Except — they seem to think 
they’re going to do me a good 
turn. I think now they let me stay 
with them so that they’d know 
where I was and could keep an eye 
on me. One other thing. Go out. 
Take Sheila with you. Go right 
away. Don’t waste any time.” 
“Why?” 

“I don’t know why. Think they 
tell me everything? But I gather 
you’re supposed to stay at home 
tonight. It’s taken for granted. It’s 
assumed you must stay at home.” 
“Then I suppose I must,” I said. 
“Don’t be an idiot. Why give in? 
They think you’ll stay at home. So 
go out. Don’t be a vegetable.” 
“Jota,” I said .“What you and 
Greg were saying to each other . 
that must be im]>ortant. What ex- 
actly did you mean when — ” 

Jota chuckled and rang off. 

“So it wasn’t Miranda,” said Shei- 
la. “What a disappointment for 
you.” 

“Sheila,” I said, “let’s go out for 
dinner.” 

“And we’ll happen to run into 
Miranda.” 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



129 




“Don’t be . silly. You pick the 
place. Right out of town some- 
where. Sheila ... I love you.” 

She looked at me doubtfully, sus- 
piciously. But I met her gaze fair 
and square. 

It wasn’t hypocritical, telling 
Sheila I loved her so soon after what 
had happened. I was quite certain 
that what had happened between 
Miranda and me would never hap- 
pen again. She had called it tragic 
. anyway, she had called some- 
thing tragic. We had met without 
meeting, and then suddenly in an 
explosion of feeling we had fused 
in one way and been blown apart 
in another. 

“We never go out to dinner,” 
Sheila said. 

That reminded me. Miranda, not 
just Jota, had said “You’re not go- 
ing out tonight.” That was another 
of the things she knew. It wasn’t 
in the cards that I would leave the 
house again that day. 

“We’re going this time,” I said. 
“Go and get yourself all dolled up. 
There isn’t a girl in Shuteley who 
can hold a candle to you when you 
really try.” 

“Except Miranda, of course.” 

“Miranda isn’t in Shuteley. I don’t 
think she’s anywhere.” 

Although this puzzled Sheila, it 
also seemed to satisfy her. 

XV 

1 rushed Shelia. She wanted to 
spend hours getting ready, as 
women do. She took it for granted 
she’d have a bath and do all the 
other things that had to be done, and 



we’d get out about seven or eight or 
nine. 

But I thought, I had a feeling, 
that if we didn’t sidestep fate, we’d 
lose the chance. Maybe twenty giants 
would arrive and keep us at home 
by force. 

And as we closed the front door 
and walked to the car — my car — 

I was certain there had been some- 
thing behind that feeling, for I felt 
myself waking up. A moment before 
I had felt tired and father disin- 
clined to go out after all, and if I 
hadn’t been hustling Sheila, if there 
had been any easy way to change 
my mind. I’d have been quite con- 
tent to stay at home watching tele- 
vision instead. 

We drove to Shuteley and south- 
wards across country to a new road- 
house, the Qibit, on the nearest 
main road. We had been there just 
once before, for a drink. 

We talked only casually. Miran- 
da wasn’t mentioned, nor the giants, 
nor Jota, nor Dina. And all the 
chill between us gradually melted. I 
realized in wonder that I liked be- 
ing with Sheila, that we were go- 
ing to enjoy ourselves. It had been 
like this before we were married, 
and for a very short time after- 
ward. 

I was happier than I had been for 
years. Sheila and I would have chil- 
dren. We’d become a family. There 
must be some solution to the prob- 
lem of Dina, if we really work^ on 
it. Perhaps it would be a tough 
one. She might have to be shown, 
with brutal directness if necessary, 
that if Sheila and I couldn’t live our 
lives in peace with her around, Dina 



130 



IF 




wouldn’t be aiUawed to stay around. 

Ouriously, although I completely 
accepted Miranda’s statement that I 
could have normal children, I left 
her promise that something would 
be done about Dina entirely in the 
air. I didn’t even think about it 
again. That I could have a family 
without fear was, after all, not hard 
to believe. It had been doubts that 
had been set at rest, not certainties. 
Dina turning into a normal teenager 
was something more in the na- 
ture of a miracle. 

A mile or so short of the road- 
house, Sheila said: “We’re far too 
early, Val. There won’t ibe a soul 
there, and it’s too soon for dinner. 
Let’s stop for a while.” 

So I drove off the road. 

M arried couples aibandon pre- 
marital parked-car behavior 
for a hundred excellent reasons. 
Kids stay parked for hours, not 
necessarily misbeihaving themselves, 
because they’ve nowhere else to go. 
After marriage, many couples try 
to recapture magic moments in cars 
parked at favorite spots . but 
even if they stay in love, it can’t 
be the same. 

Yet Sheila and I, just off the 
road, in broad daylight, managed 
to go back. We did nothing more 
than hold hands and talk, yet it 
was the same as it used to be. Half 
an hour was a minute. We talked 
about nothing at aU, certainly not 
about Miranda or Jota or Dina. 

We moved on in the end only be- 
cause, despite the magic, we were 
hungry. And the magic needn’t nec- 
essarily fly away. 



By this time I had made up my 
mind irrevocably about Dina, ^me- 
thing which she couldn’t help was 
strangling her life. But it couldn’t 
be allowed to strangle three lives 
instead of one. 

The roadhouse was long and low. 
The noise from it as I parked the 
car rather took me aback; because 
we’d thought it was a fairly quiet 
place. Then I realized that on such 
a hot night Ml the windows were 
wide open. 

Sheila had put on a new dress, 
and I didn’t get the effect until she 
emerged from the ladies’ room. She 
flushed with pleasure as I looked 
at her, knowing that I meant what 
I looked. 

She wore a short green dress with 
just enough cleavage, and I saw in 
wonder that she was much more 
beautiful than she had been the 
last time I looked at her in this way. 
A business associate who had mar- 
ried a lovely girl and then divorced 
her had told me once, over a drink, 
that he had never wanted her more 
than when he saw her for the first 
time after she had remarried. 

I was lucky. I was having the 
same sort of experience, only for 
me it wasn’t too late. 

I tried not to think of Miranda, 
and then, as Sheila went ahead to 
our table, I let myself think of Mir- 
anda . and Sheila didn’t suffer 
by comparison after all. 

Miranda was the actress in the 
safari picture. Her perfection had 
the same unreallity. She wasn’t a 
girl who worked wonders with noth- 
ing at all. She had access to tricks 
far beyond anything available even 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



131 




to the girl in the safari picture. 

Sheila didn’t have any tricks. And 
Sheiila was my wife. 

We bad a wondieirful time. It was 
easily the best evening we had ever 
spent together. And with every sec- 
ond together, we came closer. 

Only once more during the eve- 
ning, while Sheila and I were danc- 
ing, did Miranda come to mind. And 
it was with gratitude, for I knew 
that if I had not somehow been re- 
leased that day, Sheila and I would 
not he spending this kind of evening 
together. 

We didn’t prolong the evening 
greedily. We knew that unlike kids 
out on such a date, we didn’t have 
to part afterwards. We could go 
home — and to a home without 
Dina. 

So it was not long after ten when 
we 'got back in the car and started 
to drive home. 

“What’s that, Cal?” Sheila said 
idly. 

T stared and then put my foot 
hard down. 

The sky ahead of us was on fire. 

I ’d seen fires at night before. Quite 
often they look far worse than 
they are. An empty bam aflame can 
light the sky, over a hill, like a 
burning town. 

But this was something more than 
a burning bam. We could see flames 
shooting high, flames and smoke — 
and Shuteley was still ten miles 
away. 

The flames that seemed to be 
shooting miles into the sky really 
were wibat they seemed. 

At once it all fell into place. The 



giants /[new. Now I understood 
Greg’s visit and his bizarre idea of 
insuring against disaster in the next 
twenty-four hours. Of course he 
hadn’t meant to collect. He hadn’t 
even meant to have the policy drawn 
up. He had merely been amusing 
himself. 

Other things began to assume 
more significance. Miranda had 
known, I’d stay at home, and I’d 
gone out partly to malke her wrong. 
Had she known then I’d die? Or 
had she been thinilang something 
quite different, that I’d he safe out 
of it, because ^e Queen Anne house 
was in a bend in the river hundreds 
of yards from the town? 

Dina . my heart missed a beat. 
Gil’s (house was in the middle of old 
tim'bered houses in the oldest part of 
town. 

Then, with hope, I remembered 
that Miranda knew where Dina was 
and had said she expected to see 
her later. 

The giants, who had known all 
about this fire, surely didn’t pro- 
pose simply to stand and watch, 
did they? 

“What is it, Val?” Sheila said, and 
for a moment I thought she didn’t 
even realize Shuteley was on fire. 
But then she added: “What are you 
thinking about?” And I knew that 
she’d been watching my face. 

“About the giants,” I said. 

“You mean — they did this?” 

I hadn’t been thinking that and 
still didn’t, on the whole. It seemed 
far more likely that, knowing this 
was going to happen, they had 
booked their seats for the show in 
advance. Maybe last week they’d

watcihed the Great Fire of London, 
seeing St. Paul’s burned down, and 
eighty-seven parish churches, and 
13,200 homes. 

At the thought, I jerked con- 
vulsively and so did the car. The 
Great Fire was in 1666. This was 
1966, the three hundredth anniver- 
sary of the London disaster. Could 
that be coincidence? Or did it, in 
a twisted way, explain everything? 

“Sheila,” I said. “Can you remem- 
ber the date of the Great Fire of 
London?” 

“Sixteen something,” she said. 

“No, I mean the day and the 
month.” 

“You must be kidding,” she said. 

It was a pKJssi'bility that the giants 
were teenage vandals of time, des- 
troying for the sake of destruction 
and doing it on a scale beyond be- 
lief. Things I knew made this possi- 
ble too — the way, for example, in 
which the giants, even Miranda until 
a few short hours ago, obviously re- 
garded Shuteley and the people in it 
as mere Shadows of living creatures. 

Was that what Miranda had meant 
when she used the word tragic — 
tragic because suddenly, because of 
what had happened between us, she 
realized that the people of Shuteley 
were something more than names 
fading from ancient gravestones? 

B ut then I rememibered a small 
item in a TV program some 
weeks ago, unimportant at the time. 
That had been the exact anniversary 
of the Great Fire. It was past. So 
this wasn’t just a fantastic, manufac- 
tured playback for the giants’ amuse- 
ment, three centuries later. 



“Talk to me, Val,” said Sheila. 
“And don’t drive so fast. You near- 
ly went off the road at the last 
corner.” 

I slowed a little. As we approached 
Shuteley the fire seemed to spread 
until it was all around us, although 
that couldn’t be so. 

“Shuteley,” I said. “The most old- 
fashioned town in England. Oh, af- 
terwards it’s always easy to see . 
the Titanic, instead of being un- 
si nkable, was constructed so that if 
a certain thing happened she abso- 
lutely had to sink. The Lusitania 
acted as if she wanted to be sunk, 
paying no attention to instructions 
and being in one of the last places 
she ought to have been. At Pearl 
Harbor, half a dozen warnings were 
ignored, disbelieved, and what 
should have 'been expected was an 
unbelievable shook — ” 

“What are you talking about?” 
she asked, bewildered. 

“Fire risk. Well, who should 
know better than me? Naturally, 
every new building in Shuteley has 
to conform to all the latest safety 
regulations. Modifications are al- 
ways being made in all the old hous- 
es. But how much has it amounted 
to? Shuteley’s the most inflammable 
town in England — perhaps in 
Europe.” 

“You mean, a fire only had to 
start, and it would be bad?” 

“Something like that.” My 
thoughts were jumlbled. Sometimes 
I thought the giants had done it 
all, with my black-hiaired playmate 
Snow White as the sohemer-in-chief. 
Then I found myself dismissing the 
giants an mere spectators. 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS

'‘Gradually, of couirse, tihe risks 
have 'been flesseniinig,” 1 sa&l. ‘‘But 
you know Shuteley . dhaniges that 
would take ten years anyiwhere else 
take fifty in Shuteley. And this sum- 
mer there’s been hardly any rain. 
Not only the town is ibone dry, but 
the grass, the bushes, the trees. The 
river’s as low as it has ever been.” 
“You think it’s very bad, don’t 
you?” Sheila said quietly. 

I did, though in an oddly theore- 
tical, uncommitted way. ^ far I 
was only guessing. 

So I mused: “Maybe this is the 
fire that’s going to change our 
whole conception of safety measures. 
When the Titanic sank, there was 
no rule that there had to be life- 
boat accommodations for every pas- 
senger. The company thought they’d 
done ptretty well 'because they’d done 
far more than the regulations de- 
manded. We did the same. I’m sure 
of it. A lot more could have been 
done in Shuteley.” 

After a pause, thinking of the 
giants again, I said bitterly: “I 

should have known. I had the 
clues.” 

“What could you have done?” 
“Nothing, I suppose. I don’t know. 
Tried to get the police to move the 
giants on, perhaps. Watch them. 
Make sure they didn’t have a chance 
to do any damage.” 

“Then you think they did it.” 

“I don’t know. But if they didn’t 
start the fire, they knew it was go- 
ing to happen.” 

“Miranda too?” she said it quite 
evenly, with no detectable malice. 
“Miranda too,” I said rather bleak- 

ly. 



I t seemed to take an interminable 
time to drive ten miles. The road 
was narrow and >winding. It was 
not possible to average more than 
forty, and in trying to do the jour- 
ney too quickly I was losing time, 
and knew it, and lost more time 
trying to make it up. 

By this time I bad realized we’d 
have reached Shuteley sooner if I’d 
asked Sheila to drive. My brain was 
too involved with other considera- 
tions to allow me to drive well. But I 
didn’t want to stop now ^ to let her 
take over. The time lost might be 
greater than the time saved. 

“I never knew this road was so 
long,” I groaned. 

“What can you do when you get 
there?” 

“I don’t know. At least make 
sure* the firemen, the police, every- 
body involved know about the 
giants, if they don’t already.” 

“Vd,” said Sheila quietly, “calm 
down. Think — no matter how bad 
it looks, it’s only a fire.” 

“Only a fire!” I almost screamed. 
“Please, Val. Shuteley doesn’t 
consist entirely of wooden houses. 
You said yourself safety modifica- 
tions are always being made. Spaces 
have been cleared. And we have 
a modem fire-fighting service, with 
the latest equipment. You know that 
as well as I do. Better.” 

Her calm words took effect, al- 
though we now smelt smoke, burn- 
ing wood, burning rubber and — I 
hoped I was imiagining this — burn- 
ing flesh. 

Of course she was right. Despite 
the inferno we were driving towards, 
the orange gouts of flame shooting 



134 



IF 




high into the dark sky, the billowing 
clouds of smoke pouring upwards, 
the sudden spurts of flame which 
told of oil explosions or gas leaks. 

What we were seeing — the red- 
orange glow which made driving 
difficult, dimming the headlights — 
must, simply had to be, far worse 
in appearance than it was in actuali- 
ty. It looked as if we were ap- 
proaching a city the size of Man- 
chester ablaze from end to end. 
And that was impossible. Shuteley 
would be lost in a suburb of Man- 
chester. 

I took a bend with a screaming 
of tires. For a minute or two we 
were tearing frustratingly along at 
right angles to the blaze, getting no 
nearer. There was a slight rise just 
this side of the river, which meant 
that we wouldn’t get a direct view 
of the town until we were close to 
the suspension bridge. 

Yet as Sheila said, it couldn’t be 
all that bad. Shuteley being a town 
in which fires that did occur could 
be more serious more quickly than 
in other places, the fire-fighting ser- 
vice was that much more efficient 
and better equipped. In the Great 
Fire of London there probably was 
little the Londoners could do ex- 
cept throw buckets of water over 
smoldering timbers. In Shuteley, a 
great deal of damage was undoubt- 
edly being done; lives might be lost, 
but the outbreak would be contained. 

I remembered Dina again and 
caught my breath as I found myself 
thinking that if she died, one prob- 
lem was solved . 

No! I didn’t want problems to be 
solved that way. 



At last I reached the end of the 
straight and was able to turn to- 
wards the maeiLstrom again. Sud- 
denly I brak^ as I saw something 
across the road. 

Sheila screamed and cut her 
scream off abruptly. I was able 
to slow the car enough to hit the 
obstruction gently, but not enough 
to stop short of it. It looked like 
molten lava flowing sullenly across 
the road ... 

There was a brief check, nothing 
more. It was water flowing across, 
turned dull red by the glow in the 
sky. 

The car hit the last rise, and we 
both coughed. We were breathing 
thick wood-smoke. My eyes stung 
so fiercely so quickly that I braked 
again, braked harder as a cloud of 
smoke swept across the road, obscur- 
ing everything. 

Yet it was practically a windless 
night, and most of the smoke and 
flames rose straight up. Nor was 
there even a breeze to fan the flames. 
That was something. 

Then we were over the hill, almost 
at the river, and we saw the hell 
that was Shuteley.

W hen you try to burn damp 
garden refuse, you have to 
create fierce heat before the green 
twigs, sappy cuttings and weeds be- 
gin to smoke, smolder and finally 
burn. Yet no matter how wet every- 
thing is, the greedy maw of a roar- 
ing fire will in the end swallow 
everything. 

In Shuteley that summer night, 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



135 




everything inflammable or iinin- 
flamimable was as dry as tinder. 
Eveiythimg that would burn was 
ready to do so at -the first touch of 
fiiame. Everything that wouldn’t was 
neutral in the onslaught, neither 
helping nor hindering. 

All along the river on the other 
side, buildings blazed as if they’d 
been prepared for a fire display and 
then touched off at a dozen points. 
Orange flames painted the gaunt 
shells of buildings which were all 
that was left along the riverside. 
Every few seconds, above the 
crackling roar of burning wood, 
there was a crash as somewhere 
masonry collapsed. 

Nothing could be alive across the 
river from us. If anyone by some 
miracle escaped alive from any of 
those blazing buildings, there was 
no sanctuary in narrow streets swept 
with flame. I could only hope that 
the people who had be^ in these 
houses, the most densely populated 
part of the town, had already man- 
aged to get out. 

Nothing could be alive across the 
a furnace; even a fireman is full 
protective clothing would collapse 
and melt like a tallow candle. 

“The whole town,” Sheila whis- 
pered beside me. “Everything’s burn- 
ing. There’s nothing left.” 

She was right. The fire stretched 
on both sides to the limits of the 
town. And although we could see 
practically nothing through the wall 
of fire, the flames and smoke which 
gushed into the red sky showed that 
behind what we could see the fire 
was just as intense. 

Where we were, a hundred yards 



from the river and looking across 
it to a strip of scorched earth and 
stone and concrete that could burn 
no more — perhaps three hundred 
yards from the nearest flame — we 
were facing a blast of heat that 
would have killed us in time and 
must already have been toasting us, 
although we were protected by the 
car’s body and were looking through 
glass. But we were too fascinated 
to draw back. 

Only after we had seen all there 
was to be seen on tne other side 
of the river did we look closer. 

Sheila gasped. The suspension 
bridge was buckled, twisted, still 
spanning the river but with its me- 
tals glowing and a huge pile of 
nibble in the river bed below it. 

The river was practically dry. 
Only thin crimson trickles ran 
through the mud and stones and 
weeds. 

To the left, the New Bridge was 
piled high with masonry and still- 
burning timber. The warehouses 
across the river had collapsed into 
the dry bed. 

There were people and machines 
this side of the New Bridge, a few 
hundred yards along from where we 
stood, but I had little attention to 
spare yet for this side of the river, 
where there were few buildings and 
those not on fire. 

Instead I looked the other way 
— and saw that the Old Bridge 
was down. It lay shattered in the bed 
of the river, an astonishingly vast 
pile of rubble, apparently the 
blockage that was holding back the 
river. But that way I couldn’t see 
distinctly, because something close 



136 



IF 




to the Old Bridge on tihe opposite 
side was shooting out dense douds 
of smoke. 

And I began to reailize the full 
horror of the situation, which I had 
scarcely thought, a moment ago, 
could be worse. 

Ihere were two footbridges be- 
yond the bridges I could see, but 
both were partly wooden. It could 
be taken for granted they were 
destroyed. And the next nearest 
bridge was twenty miles away. 

Shuteley was a backwater at the 
best of times. Yet in the middle of 
a well populated country, the town 
could never have been described as 
isolated — until now. 

The main road, the big Midland 
towns, the rest of England were 
reached from this side. On the other, 
lanes meandered through villages, 
brooks, farms, woods. Of course 
help could reach the town that 
way, but it would take hours. And 
this was a lightning fire. 

Sheila was puling at my arm, 
trying to make me reverse back over 
the hil. But before I did anything 
else, I looked back at the New 
Bridge. 

It was hard to see exactly what 
was going on there, because sheds 
and war^ouses cut off the view, 
and at this point there was no road 
along the bank. But I saw two fire 
engines and men in helmets. 

And they were on this side of the 
river. 

y tried to start the car and only 
X after several seconds did I realize 
I’d never killed the motor. I put 
the car in reverse . 



There were two faint pops and 
the (front settled. At the same time. 
1 notioed steam rising from the front 
of the oar. Above al the other 
burning smells. I smelled rubber. 

Protected by the car, I hadn’t 
realized that the fierce heat from 
across the river was capable of 
melting the tires and boiling the 
water in the radiator. -However, the 
car did move jerkily, and* in a few 
seconds we were back over the 
brow of the hil, protected by it. 

“What can we do?” Sheila said. 

Wei, what could we do? Noth- 
ing, probably. Nobody could do any- 
thing that I could see. It was too 
late for any measures that I could 
imagine. 

It was ironic and symbolic, rather 
than really important, that the fire- 
men were trapped this side of the 
river. Certainly they could do noth- 
ing if they crossed the bridge — if 
it were possible to cross the bridge. 
The fire engines were rubber shod, 
Ike my car, and there was water 
in the radiators. Anyway, firemen 
in conventional unifomi couldn’t get 
near a conflagration like that. 

Since the only sign of life we 
had seen had b^n at this end of 
the New Bridge, I turned the car 
and, running on the rim with a 
steaming radiator, drove along the 
lane behind the warehouses. 

I stopped. 

Here in the semi-gloom, lit by the 
blaze in the sky but unaffected by 
the outbreak as yet, were old huts, 
sheds, stores. And in the lane in 
front of us, blazing fiercely, was a 
wood brand a foot thick and three 
feet long.

We got out of the car and looked the time. Indeed, I could see them 
at the hlazing halk rather helplessly, (flying across the sky.

some value on this side of the river, 
of none if directed the other way. 

I recognized Fire Officer Sayell, 
brother of the wit of my office. 
“How did it start?” I asked. 

His face twitched in annoyance, 
and I realized how silly my question 
was. Undoubtedly later there would 
be an investigation, and it might 
even be possible to establish the 
original cause of the fire. Meantime 
there were a million things that mat- 
tered more. 

“Excuse me, Mr. Mathers,” he 
said, and I recognized the carefully 
controlled tone of a man near the 
end of his tether, impotent, with an 
impossible job on his hands. “There’s 
not much I can do, but I’ve got to 
get on with it anyway.” 

“There’s help coming?” 

“Lots of it. Mostly to the other 
side. Nobody can do anything much 
here. We’ve tried the ladders. They 
don’t reach the other side, not from 
any place we can put the tenders.” 

I t would not, I thought, have made 
much difference if the ladders had 
spanned the bed. Nobody could go 
across there and live. Anyway, the 
steel ladders would buckle in the 
heat. 

Sayell swore as one of the jets 
failed, closely followed by the other. 

“Everything’s wrong,” he said bit- 
terly. “The river’s dried up. Block- 
ed higher up.” 

“How about the Winshell brook?” 
Sheila suggested. 

“Dry before this happened. Dry 
yesterday.” 

“Have you looked?” I demanded. 
He stared at me with desperation 



in his eyes. The interference of local 
VIP’s was another penultimate straw. 

“No, I haven’t bloody looked!” he 
snapped. “The bloody brook was 
dry when the river was still — ” 

“Se«Kl somebody,” I said. 

Suddenly quiet, he said : “Do you 
want me to 'hit you, Mr. Mathers? 
Do you want me to cleave your 
skull with my axe? Because so help 
me — ” 

“Send somebody to look,” I said 
and turned slightly away. If I tried 
to outface him, maybe he would 
cleave my skull with his axe. Many 
men with impossible jobs on their 
hands get like Sayell then. A breath 
of opposition sends them into spon- 
taneous combustion. 

But if someone says casually 
“Do so-and-so” and moves on, 
they’ve got something to try, some- 
thing that isn’t likely to make the 
situation any worse and might im- 
prove it. And if it fails utterly, it’s 
not his fault. 

Behind me, Sayell shouted: “Hor- 
ner! Take a look over the hill and 
try the Winshell brook. And look 
lively!” 

The Winshell brook was a tiny 
tributary of the Shute. It went the 
wrong way, meeting the river head 
on rather than quietly trickling into 
it. The meeting place, called not un- 
expectedly The Meeting of the 
Waters, was only a short distance 
downriver from where we stood. 

I had remembered the water run- 
ning across the road. 

At the giant’s camp, at our house, 
probably even just beyond the 
mound of debris at the Old Bridge 
which I had glimpsed through the

IF 




smcJke, the river was still running. It 
was only in Shuteley itself, at the 
moment it was most needed, that it 
had run dry. But all the water was 
still flowing somewhere. Some of it, 
though not nearly enough, was still 
getting through along the old river 
bed. Some of it was perhaps going 
to the other side of the river, doing 
something to limit the blaze. That 
was unlikely, however, because it 
would have to get round Castle 
Hill. 

The rest of it must be flowing 
along the other side of the hill 
which for so many miles had cut 
off our view of Shuteley. And the 
Winshell brook was there.

'"T^he human animal has survived 
and will continue to survive, 
because of its enormous talent for 
adaptation — and rapid adapta- 
tion at that. 

We were living in a world of 
smoke which stung our eyes and 
made breathing always difficult, 
sometimes painful and occasionally 
impossible. 

We were living in a world of 
heat which made sweat run from 
us continuously. We were all so 
thirsty that we would have drunk 
anything, "even the muddy crimson 
trickles that were still meandering 
down the river bed. 

We were living in a world where 
thirst, pain, hunger and comfort 
had to be^set apart. All of us had 
small burns where sparks had 
landed. Several of us had small 
smoldering spots in our clothes 



which we beat out absently. We were 
hungry from our exertions, at least I 
was, but that didn’t mean the thought 
of eating was present. Drinking was 
different. All of us, given the 
chance, would have knocked down 
a pint or two of water, milk, lem- 
onade, beer, anything. We couldn’t 
say drinking no longer mattered. 
We’d have drunk greedily " if we 
could. But if we couldn’t, it would 
have to wait. 

We were living in a nightmare 
world where only one thing could 
be held in the mind at one time. 
At the moment it was the Winshell 
brook. Even Sayell, who had wanted 
to kill me for bothering him, was 
waiting, praying. 

If there was water, something 
could be done. Without water, stuck 
across the river from the fire (which 
nobody for the moment was look- 
ing at) we could no nothing but 
watch this side of Shuteley, such as 
it was, burn with the rest. 

It was no use thinking of what 
had happened and was still hapi>en- 
ing across the river. Apparently these 
firemen knew little more than I did 
about that. 

Our wives, children, parents, 
friends and lovers were over there, 
dead or alive. Either they’d escaped 
when the fire started (whenever that 
was) or they were still there, for- 
ever, unrecognizable. 

I suppose I was the luckiest of 
all those people there. Sheila was 
with me, and Sheila, despite every- 
thing, was the human being I cared 
most about. Sheila and I were go- 
ing to live. If necessary we could 
escape and save ourselves. 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



141 




We had no children, and at that 
moment I had never been more glad 
of anything. Sheila’s parents were 
dead, and the remaining parent I 
had was far from Shuteley. 

Hiere was only Dina to worry 
about. And Gil, perhaps. 

As for the others . Well, 
through being faithful to Sheila and 
her alone, I had become unconcern- 
ed with most of the people in Shute- 
ley. In the office, I was concern- 
ed chiefly about Sally Henrey, and 
she was on holiday, out of this al- 
together. Of course I’d be sorry about 
many others. But they weren’t close, 
apart from Gil. And was he close 
any more? 

Somebody screamed, and I turn- 
ed. As if thrown by an ancient cata- 
pult, a blazing mass of timber was 
flying in a leisurely parabola across 
the dry river, strai^t for us. 

I grabbed Sheila and pulled her 
to the left. But we bumped into 
two very solid firemen and bounced 
the other way. The timber crashed 
on the ground twenty yards from us. 

Nobody was near it. Everybody 
had had plenty of time to get clear. 
But when it hit the ground it flew 
asunder into a thousand blazing 
sparks which exploded in all direc- 
tions, and the curses and screams 
of those hit by the sparks temporar- 
ily drowned the noises from across 
the river. 

A -couple of brands dug into my 
clothes and obstinately stuck. I was 
trying to brush them off when a 
scream from Sheila made me look 
at her and see that a spark was 
clinging like a leech to the front 



of her dress. I tore off my jacket, 
sUll with a smoldering patch in it, 
and plucked away the spark and 
some of her dress, whereupon Sheila 
promptly fainted. 

I could have sworn she had her 
fur wrap on, but either it had 
slipped off unnoticed or she had 
thrown it away in the broiling heat. 
Picking her up, I carried her be- 
hind the shelter of one of the 
sheds. The spark on my leg had 
fallen off, though not before burning 
through to the skin. The' pain was 
sharp and more like a stab wound 
than a bum. 

I put Sheila down. She’d had been 
lucky. There was no sign of a burn. 

I pulled up a leg of my pants 
and saw to my astonishment that 
the considerable pain in my leg 
was caused by a tiny burn no larger 
than a pinprick. 

Sheila opened her eyes. She 
didn’t move. “Val,” she said, “am I 
badly burned?” 

“You aren’t burned at all,” I said 
bluntly. Reassured, she jumped up 
and wailed when she saw that the 
left top half of her dress was torn 
away. 

“Where’s your wrap?” I demand- 
ed. 

“I can’t wear it in this heat. 
It’s — ” 

“Find it, put it on and keep it 
on.” 

“Sparks stick in it.” 

“I know, but ...” 

I was beginning to realize that 
though it was reassuring to have 
your wife with you in such a sit- 
uation, and many men who found 
themselves alone at this moment

IF 




would have given their right arms to 
be as fortunate as I was, a fully 
feminine girl like Sheila kept your 
hands full. You’d scarcely time even 
to see what was going on. 

So I said: “Look Sheila, the best 
thing you can do is gather all the 
kids and old folk together and take 
them back over the hill, where it’s 
safe, and just stay there. A lot of 
people were burned and injured un- 
necessarily just now. They needn’t 
have been here.” 

“And what are you going to do?” 
she demanded. 

I shrugged. I didn’t know. If the 
firemen were helpless, it wasn’t like- 
ly I’d be able to do anything use- 
ful. But I had to try. I had to be 
there. If I could no nothing else, I 
had to stand and watch. 

“What will this mean to your 
job?” Sheila said. 

T rust a woman to be practical. 

The thought seemed to come 
from a thousand miles away. 

But I was responsible for practi- 
cally all the insurance in Shuteley 
— and the San Francisco disaster 
that wrecked insurance companies 
among other things was a minor af- 
fair compared with this. True, Shut- 
eley wasn’t a big town. But never in 
history, savp by act of war, had 
any town been so completely 
destroyed as Shuteley obviously 
would be before this was over. 



Behind us there was a shout. And 
we ran back, for at such a time the 
last thing we expected to hear was 
a shout filled with excitement and 
delight. 

When we saw the firemen talking 
to Say ell and gesticulating, we didn’t 
have to hear what they were saying. 
There was water in the Winchell 
brook, and plenty of it. 

It was remarkable how merely 
having something they could do 
transformed the firemen from a 
dispirited, cursing, demoralized mob, 
no more useful than the children and 
old people who still stood around, 
into an efficient, well drilled team. 

A squad raced up the hill with 
their equipment, and Sayell turned 
to me, his face alight. “Thanks, Mr. 
Mathers,” he said. “If it hadn’t been 
for you, we might never have looked 
at the brook. I never guessed it 
would be . anyway, we’re in 
business again.” 

Significantly he turned to look 
at the fire on the other side of the 
river, which for some time he had 
been ignoring. Then he turned back, 
shouting orders. 

I sent Sheila to do as I’d suggested 
and saw that she too became effi- 
cient once she had something to do. 
She waved to me as she shepherded 
the children and the old people over 
the hill . and that was the last 
I saw of her while the Great Fire 
raged.

IF • Short Story 



HAIRRY 

by MIKE HILL 



Never know what you're going fo 
meet out in the red. You might 
even meet something tike this! 



T he band finished the number 
with a flare of the clarinet and 
a whoom and rattle of the drums. 

Jake began talking again, “The 
way I met Hairry? I was out in the 
red with a geological survey team 
looking for petroleum. That’s not the 
cleanest sport in the world, but 1 
wanted to get ahead, and the pay 
was good. We were working the 
canal branches to the north out of 
Thorsport, and we pitched camp 
up near the mountains. There’s been 
no fauna of any account discovered 
in that region in all the thirty years 
since the planet survey, but we slept 
in the tractor tanks anyway. That 
way we didn’t have to carry tents 
and wefen’t bothered by the cold 
nights. 

" “Well, you know the ceremony in 
the desert when a new camp is 
pitched. We had a ten-gallon oil 
can full, with plenty of bio-fixed 
alky from the chemical stores added. 



There’s no hangover if you do that, 
and not only does it make a good 
party, but the effects last over into 
the next day. By the time it fades 
out the job is going good, and the 
scenery hasn’t bothered you a bit. 
But you can’t have a party with this 
stuff every day either. 

“A good party — did you ever 
hear Jam Pot on a radio turned up 
full, helped along by harmonica, 
samisen, banjo and tin cane — in- 
side a tractor tank? Twenty db’s too 
loud, but sweet just the same. The 
Chief is drinking only bourbon; he 
quits early and goes off to the office 
wagon. But the rest of us think we 
sound fine. 

T he next day, still feeling the beat, 
we get into the scout cars and 
start on the branch canals. The 
ground is broken up on these branch- 
es — the scouts nevertheless can go 
nearer the edges than the heavy trac- 



144 




tors, and of course the nearer the 
edge the better you can study the 
strata. Even with the branches it’s 
a long way to the bottom. I drive off 
humming the oiler’s song.” 

H ere Jake broke into song in his 
gratey voice: 

Oil, oil, oil well; sh, shush, 
whoosh, whoom! 

Clik, clak, clik, clak, tread that 
turns the wheel. 

Sand, sand, salt dome, salt that 
covers the boom 
Drill, drill, drill deep, down, 
deep down, to oil. 

After a while, I whisk off my hel- 
met and try a turn on my harmonica. 
It lacks something, but still being 
in a state myself I like it. But the 
camp intercom is still on. My jazz 
harmonica must’ve been giving a 
concert for the Chief, because next 
thing I hear is his bull roar. 

” ‘Jake, you fool, quit that. And 
close your flacky helmet. If you hit 
a bump and spring a leak in that gut 
busted crap box you drive, you — * 
The Chief knows all those good old- 
fashioned words. 

“So seeing how he is right and I 
am wrong/l shut and dog my helmet, 
and a good thing, too. One minute 
I’m breezing along with a good view 
in all directions; pearly sky, smiling 
crags — not a worry in the uni- 
verse. Then I hit a flaw in the bank. 

“The car tilts — I try to set it 
right, but then I get a sinking feel- 
ing. I glance to the up side and see 
a crack widening in the ground. 
Frantically I gun the engine and try 



to get back on solid grouiid; bui • 
edge is breaking too fast! Man! I .n 
flying — and without wings! 

“The crumbling rock gives way 
completely; the scout car flips out 
over the canal, and I’m in free fall. 
The car turns slowly as it drops 
downwards, and I get a beautiful 
view of a thin ribbon of water way 
down below. Inside the glass bubble 
of the dome I can hear the thin air 
whining past, and everything seems 
unreal. I try to close my eyes, but I’m 
hypnotized. I think about home; I 
wish I were there. Mama wanted me 
to be a violinist; Papa wanted me 
to work in the shop; me — I wanted 
to be an oil geologist — so here I 
am. The ribbon of water comes 
closer and closer, faster and faster, 
larger and larger. Everywhere. Sud- 
denly I’m not here; I’m in sweet vel- 
vet blackness. 

“The blackness thins. I hear water 
and open my eyes. The water is 
splashing past the helmet of my 
suit, and I’m bobbing up and down 
like a Halloween apple. I’m alive! 
I start moving my arms like a wind- 
mill and finally thrash to the edge 
of the canal, gasping for breath. 1 
pull myself up onto the jagged, de- 
cayed edge and sit gasping until time 
catches up with me. Then I pull my- 
self together and look the situation 
over. Down the canal a way is the 
wreckage of my scout car grinding 
against a fallen rock. The bubble has 
a hole in it large enough for a man 
— me — to have popped out like 
a pingpong ball. Which is lucky for 
me, but that scout car is gone for- 
ever, which looks like the time I’m 
about to spend down here. 



HAIRRY 



145 




“It is very shady down here at the 
bottom of the canal gorge. I look 
upwards, and I’m very astonished at 
how tall the cliffs are. Way above 
me I see a thin line that must be 
the sky, with a star or two shining 
in it . I’m wondering how in 
forever I will make it to the top. 
Things get suddenly worse. A cloud 
drops over me with no warning. It 
looks like a wisp of fog; but of 
course there can be no fog here. I 
brush at it. It does not brush away, 
but sticks gooey to my glove. I don’t 
get it at first, but more strands drift 
down on me, and then I see this 
thing with ten legs start going round 
and round me. A spider! Big. Big 
as me. It must be the air or gravity, 
but it’s sure big. A chill goes through 
me. I stare at the spider stuff in 
horror. Desperately, I try to tear 
the stuff off my suit, stumbling 
around on the jumbled rocks of 
the canl edge. But more of the web 
settles over me. I struggle with the 
stuff, but it is sticky; and the more 
I move, the more I get tangled in 
the mess. 

44T’m a cocoon. I’m wound so 

X tight I cannot move. But my 
view plate is free enough of the 
web, so I can see the character who 
does me this dirty trick. A ten- 
legged spider scittles around me, two . 
legs straight in the air; there are a 
few sights I would prefer. In a mo- 
ment I feel myself lifted and carried 
along on its back. I start having men- 
tal pictures of things that might hap- 
pen next. Each one is worse than 
the one before. 

“Suddenly we are in darkness, me 



and the ten-legged streetcar. We are 
going through a tunnel. I bump 
whenever we go through a narrow 
place. Finally it gets a little ligjhter. 
I can see that the walls are studded 
with luminescent rocks. The colors 
are very pretty, but I’m in no mood 
for the appreciation of scenery. I 
have a suspicion that unkind things 
are being planned for me. To be 
specific, I feel like a package from 
the meat market. I have a hunch 
that I am to be the .main course in 
an arachnid smorgasbord. 

“Finally I am deposited in a hole 
in the wall. The multilegged mon- 
ster is very neat about this. The web 
stuff around my suit acts like pack- 
ing, and I am wedged tight in the 
crevice. Just for security a few new 
strands fasten me for good to the 
walls, so I can’t wander off. Then 
I am left alone with my imagination. 

“Now and then, one of the crea- 
tures scuttles by. Most of them pay 
no attention, but a few take careful 
inventory. Maybe this is a main 
highway for these characters. May- 
be the ones that look me over think 
I’m a lobster. 

“After a while a spider comes 
along who does not seem to be in 
such a rush and gives me the glad 
eyes. There is nothing I can do but 
look back again. When I get a good 
look at his color arrangements, I 
feel as if I’ve slipped a dimension, 
like you do when you go in over- 
drive. 

“ ‘I can change’em for my friends,* 
says a voice from nowhere. 

“Now I know I’m cracking. I am 
hearing voices, and I am wonder- 
ing if I should answer. Then I no- 



146 



IF 




tice that the spider is looking at 
me like he just passed a remark. I 
know it’s impossible, but these spi- 
ders have not been discovered by 
the all-seeing survey either. 

“So I try a snappy rejoinder, ‘Did 
you say something?’ 

“ ‘Daddyo, you hear gospel,’ with a 
flash of green along its legs that 
chilled me cold. 

“This leaves me speechless for a 
moment. I mean spiders can’t talk; 
they breathe through their joints, or 
cracks in their shell, and have no 
vocal cords; besides, these particular 
spiders don’t exist, having not been 
surveyed. And more besides, my 
specimen is covered with thick, stiff, 
long hair all over, and you wouldn’t 
have heard him if he were talking. 
Except on the ends of his legs, where 
he has six hairless fingers apiece. 

“‘How can you talk? I don’t be- 
lieve it,’ I assert. 

“ ‘Oh man! Don’t come on so 
square! I’m a telepath. All us cats 
are telepaths.* 

“I am astonished. ‘Where did you 
get that jive talk?’ 

“‘On the radio, man. I dig that 
jazz the most.’ 

“‘A radio!’ I am double astonish- 
ed. ‘You bugs don’t exist. How would 
you get a radio?’ 

“‘Hah, man! I drum, I live. Yours 
isn’t the first scout car that’s gone 
over the edge. I stole a radio. I 
found the thing in a wrecked scout 
car a long time ago. When I moved 
the dials, things happened. Oh, man! 
When I heard that thing, something 
happened inside me. I took it to my 
pad. Then I heard the true word; 
then I got religion.’ 

HAIRRY 



“ ‘The true word? What’s the true 
word?’ 

“‘Oh, man! Chummy Harris on 
sax! Dizzy Casper on vibes! Man 
it’s all true.’ 

“ ‘I don’t believe it,’ I snarl and 
jerk at the webs that hold me. ‘You 
wouldn’t recognize ‘Jam Pot’ if you 
heard it live.’ 

‘“Jam Pot’ OH WOW! I FLIP.’ 
And he really does; up and over like 
a hot cake, rustling against the walls, 
hopping on his hind legs between 
the flips; and then finally up to the 
ceiling and down on a silver thread, 
spinning wildly. All this with chamel- 
eon effects, too. This daffy arachnid 
is gone on jazz; and he isn’t coming 
back. When he finally bounces to a 
stop, he snaps his fingers. 

“ ‘Oh, man. You know things. We 
got to have a talk in private; this 
tunnel echoes thoughts all up and 
down. Nobody else here knows about 
jazz like I do, and that’s what I 
dig the most.’ 

“Working plenty fast with hands 
or feet or what, he loosens the webs 
from the rocks and tosses me on his 
back. 

“ ‘Where are we going?’ I wonder, 
^as we race down the passageway. 

“‘Not so loud. Pops; think easy. 
We’re going to my pad. It’s insulated 
for thought and sound, and that’s 
where the radio is.’ 

4 finally reach the hole in 

VV the rock that he calls his 
pad. There is a web across the en- 
trance; that he pulls aside, slicks us 
through and gums it back, before I 
can see how he does it. Probably just 
a matter of having enough fingers. 

147 




Plenty more web siali pads the little 
cave all over. At the tar side, against 
the bare rock, is the radio. He wasn’t 
kidding; he really has the thing. 
Dropping me on the floor, he begins 
fiddling with the dials. In a moment 
sound blazes into the cave from the 
hot jazz program out of Thorsport. 

“‘Oh, man!’ says the hipster. ‘1 
gotta get in on this!* 

“Alongside the radio on the same 
rock shelf, he has a crude but fair- 
ly complete set of drums. He seizes 
these, three of them, and begins on 
them, and he also makes a queer 
motion with four of his other legs, 
one leg plucking the others, another 
leg rubbing the others. A flutelike 
keening rises, mixed with the per- 
cussion of the drums; a chilling, en- 
rapturing rhythm seizes me, and I 
beat my feet against the floor of the 
cave. For a moment I wonder if this 
is some sort of ritual before the 
feast, but when the radio stops, he 
stops, and I lay panting. 

“ ‘How did you learn that?’ I 
think. 

“ ‘Easy, Pops. I listen to the 
sounds, and I know what’s making 
them. I made these drums. It took 
a long while. And the rest I just got 
into. The drums are just a crude set, 
but it’s the best 1 could do without 
scratch.* 

“ ‘Scratch!’ 

“ ‘Sure, man. Bundle. Bread. 
Dough Money. Pops, without scratch 
you can’t do so much.’ 

“Civilization coming from a spi- 
der. vou see. 

“Well, that’s how I first met 
Hairry.” 

“You were in quite some fix.’* 



Jake continued, “Hairry begins 
working on the drums again, and 1 
have to admit he is good, but good. 
He has all ten of his drums now 
and isn’t doing any of the leg stuff. 
An idea begins to glimmer in my 
mind — how would this cat look 
fronting a twenty piece outfit? 

“The hipster’s eyes have been half 
closed in a dreamy concentration on 
the drums; but now they open wide, 
and all ten drums pop wide open. 

“‘Pops, I read you clear. You 
think good, and I can see scratch 
in the background.’ 

“I can see it too, but first I can 
see a way out of this mess I’m tied 
in. After that maybe with the right 
manager this arachnid can clean the 
air. 

“1 even start wondering how his 
name would look in lights. ‘What do 
they call you?’ I ask. 

“ ‘Man, they call me as little as 
possible. They think I’m nuts. It’s 
sour grapes. There’s only one radio 
and all us spiders. But I got a tag.* 
There follows on my mind an impres- 
sion which I can’t untangle. 

“I shake my head. ‘That don’t 
pronounce, and it don’t spell. I’d rath- 
er call you something that people can 
recognize. What you look like. 
Hairry, that’s good. I can’t spell, 
anyway.’ 

“‘Crazy, dad. Call me anything 
but beautiful.’ 

“‘Crazy, Hairry.’ And now I 
broach the delicate point. ‘We can’t 
do anything down here. For one 
thing alone, my suit air won’t last 
overnight. 

“‘So how can we get out of here 
and play some real?’ 



148 



IF 




4 4 T T airry lays down his sticks and 
looks at me, with all his 
eyes. But then he pushes aside any 
visions of meals he sees and takes 
the bait. 

‘“Good spider,’ I think, without 
thinking. 

“He winks at me with exactly half 
his eyes. 

“ ‘That takes some thinking. Pops. 
You’re' the main dish for dinner to- 
night. It’ll be hard to get you away 
from the King.’ 

“I suddenly think that these char- 
acters are people, in their way. 

‘“Sure, man, and we got a high 
priest and vestal virgins.’ 

“Arachnid humor. He winks the 
other half of his eyes. 

“‘Oh, man, they have. But I’m 
out of it now, with these.’ He points 
to his drums. ‘Man, you set me up 
like you showed, and I’m with you.’ 

“ ‘It’s a deal,’ I think. 

“‘Pops, you’re my private pack- 
age now. Up on my back, and with 
enough of this webbing around you 
no one will see you. But, oh man, 
keep your thoughts on jazz, so they’ll 
think it is me. Like, they’d believe 
anything I’d do, just so it didn’t 
seem reasonable.’ 

“To me this was as good a plan 
as any I’d been thinking of. ‘Just 
make it fast » enough to avoid the 
dinner rush.* 

“ ‘Right, Pops.’ Hairry picks down 
some of the door web and slaps it 
around me, then puts me on his 
back. He ambles out into the pas- 
sage. I can just barely sense him 
going dah bah dittin bittn achhh 
ohhh, bop, to himself. Let the other 
spiders figure out his plans from 



that if they can. They are all around, 
though, as Hairry rushes along. 
Sometimes I get a glimpse through 
the threads, and sometimes I get a 
drift of the mental fog they use for 
conversation. I try to think in jazz, 
too, but not a tune can I remem- 
ber. I try not to think too loud. 
How do you think in a mutter when 
you got worries like I have? 

“Suddenly Hairry gives a mental 
shout. ‘Oh, wow! They know that 
dinner’s gone! And they know 
where!’ His pace changes to a gallop. 
‘Hang on. Pops, it’s all or nothing! 
If they catch us, I’ll be the side 
dish.’ I cling to the cocoon around 
me, for what good that does, but for 
the first time I am glad that the 
sticky web sticks to Hairry as good 
as it sticks to me. 

“Hairry really works up some 
speed. He races down the tunnel, not 
taking much care what he hits. We 
break around a corner into an al- 
cove — occupied by four spiders 
waiting for us. I think we are lost, 
but Hairry bowls right through them, 
legs flying loose in all directions. 
Two of them manage to fasten webs 
onto us, but Hairry spins his ninth 
leg in a sort of Gordian knot opera- 
tion and cuts the webs off, before 
the two can even tighten them. 

“‘Wonder what the score would 
have been if Hairry had lost that 
leg,’ flies through my mind. 

“‘I’d grow a new one. Pops.’ 

“We are rushing down the tunnel 
again, almost as fast as I’d fallen 
down into the canal in the first 
place, but in perfect darkness. A 
glimmer of light shows far ahead. A 
point, a star, growing larger by the

minute. As we get closer, I can see 
that it is the mouth of the tunnel. 
We break into the open, and Hairry 
races along the edge of the canaL 

“‘Oh, wow, I can hear them call- 
ing up the reserves!’ 

“With a burst of speed, Hairry 
swerves into a cleft in the cliff wall 
and begins climbing upwards. Down 
below we can hear the other spiders 
in pursuit. Their thoughts are loud 
and angry. Several of them try to 
get into the cleft at the same time. 
They jam. Then more push from be- 
hind. Hairry hesitates. 

4C^"T^hen, ‘All or nothing,’ he mur- 
A murs. He turns his radio on 
full and lets it drop onto the top 
of the sprawl. Some of them re- 
spond and begin to dance. In fact, 
Hairry’s ruse works almost too well. 
Hairry begins to dance and wave 
his legs as if drumming; he begins 
to edge back down the cleft! 

“ ‘Stay with Jake, Hairry,’ I plead, 
but without much result, ‘There’s 
bigger radios with Jake.’ I visualize 
an all-transistor monster receiving 
three different jazz programs at the 
same time, but the visualization isn’t 
strong enough to break through to 
Hairry. He drops me on the ground 
and continues jogging down the cleft. 
I finally work my harmonica loose 
and into my mouth. I play on it and 
imagine that it is a twenty piece 
band. 

“This is all yours, Hairry,’ and I 
visualise Hairry playing the drums 
in that band. Well, that does it. 
Hairry breaks loose from the spell 
that holds him, races back, picks me 
up and starts moving for the top 



again. The sounds of the combined 
jam session and donnybrook in the 
mouth of the cleft drift far behind 
and below until there is nothing. 
Even after that it takes a half hour 
of Hairry’s best climbing to reach 
the top. Hairry heaves me onto the 
ground with a thump and sprawls 
his ten legs out, resting. 

“Far away, tiny but bright in the 
afternoon light is the most beautiful 
sight that has ever greeted my eyes: 
a bunch of tanks and tractors in a 
circle around the camp site. 

“ Pops, we are here, free and 
clear.* 

“Hairry rests some more, then 
pulls all the webbing off me, then 
rests again. Even for a spider that is 
some climb. I am a little stiff my- 
self, partly from being tied up so 
long and partly from straining 
against the webbing. It feels great to 
be back on my own feet. Hairry 
watches as I stumble around, trying 
to work up the circulation. 

“‘Pops, the trouble with you is 
you don’t have enough legs.’ 

“Well, I am glad he has his ten, 
so he gets no argument there. We 
start walking toward the camp site. 
It takes a couple — three hours, so 
it is almost sundown when we hear 
voices. You can see a long way in 
the desert, and sound carries far, 
too. Voices begin coming in as the 
guys get into camp and start yakking 
on the intercoms. As we get nearer, 
I hear the unmistakable ping of a 
neutron rifle, the way the charge 
crackles. 

“A stone to one side of us vanish- 
es in a puff of powdered rock, and 
we dive for cover. I hear a commo-

tion behind me and turn to see 
Hairry disappearing in a cloud of 
sand. 

“ ‘Whattinell are you doing, 
Hairry?’ 

“His mental voice comes dimly 
through the flying grit, ‘Pops, I know 
it’s square, but I’m digging a hole!’ 

In a few minutes Hairry is com- 
pletely out of sight beneath a mound 
of sand. I dog into my suit’s tool 
pockets and pull out a white swab 
rag. This I tie to a chipping hammer 
and wave over the top of the dune. 
Then I hear a voice I know, old 
heavy bass boss-guy himself. 

“ ’Jake, you goldbricking poisoner, 
is that you?’ 

“ ‘It won’t be if you keep shooting 
that thing at me.*” 

T he first sounds of the musicians 
tuning up offstage began to drift 
to us. Jake resumed hurriedly, “Well, 
that’s the complete story of how I 
met Hairry. Things progressed one 
after another after that bullet. We 
got into town all right with no trou- 



ble from the chief. He thought it was 
all the funniest, with special snickers 
to the survey. We got our start by 
Hairry dropping in on one of 
Casper’s sessions, playing the drums 
full tilt. There’s nobody that can 
resist him. Well, I have to hurry off 
now. Stop around after the show, 
and I’ll introduce you. Watch this 
now.” And he was off. 

A silken rope began to lower on- 
to the brightened stage. Then six 
spider drums, each held by a hand 
of a different color, appeared below 
the edge of the curtain. Suddenly a 
crescendo broke from the drums. 
Hairry swung down the rope, and 
the rest of the band raised out of the 
floor. A samisen, a tin cane, clari- 
nets and flutes. They all sang out, 
but Hairry topped their every note 
and outswung their eveiy rhythm 
in a flow of tone, a niceness of 
syncopation, a burst of skyrocket 
colors. 

Hairry. As Jake said, “There’s no- 
body that can resist him.”

IF • Short Story 



The Boat in the Bottle 

by THURLOW WEED 



She was the finest Boat on all 
Earth's oceans — and doomed 
to the sea's most fantastic end! 



T he Boat was the world’s most 
impressive ship, as she was in- 
tended to be. This was why she was 
named The Boat. It had been de- 
cided in a Board Meeting that a 
more prosaic name, such as Maresta 
or Grand Dame (both of which had 
been suggested), would not do for the 
vessel which was to be the supreme 
achievement of all shipbuilding. It 
was agreed, also, that the air of cas- 
ualness about the name would ap- 
peal to some travellers who, though 
possessed of great wealth, sought a 
formal casualness when travelling. 

She was an impressive ship in 
several ways. First of all, she was 
longer than any ship, any ocean 
liner, at least, had ever been. She 
was two thousand feet long. She 
could carry three thousand passen- 
gers and required a crew of two 



thousand to operate her and serve 
those passengers. She was almost 
four4enths of a mile long and 
could go the nautical equivalent of 
forty miles an hour. 

Simply to build her as the world’s 
most impressive ship was, of course, 
not the end of it. She had also to 
be fitted out in the proper manner. 
For a ship with such a name noth- 
ing would be too elaborate or too 
plush. 

Even and especially her name 
was made much of in the outfitting. 
It was made the motif of all decora- 
tion and ornamentation, both in- 
terior and exterior. Great mosaics 
filled entire walls in lounges, salons, 
and even in the wider corridor. Each 
mosaic featured either the profile of 
the vessel or her name as the cen- 
tral element. One mosaic, in fact, 



152 




the one behind the Second (or as 
they called it, The Traveller) Class 
bar, was composed entirely of “The 
Boat” written thousands of times in 
miniature script. So discreetly done 
was it that only drinkers at the bar 
could be sure of the text, and they 
not for long. 

But should drink get the better of 
them, blurring their vision, they were 
reminded by the bottles and glasses 
from which they drank their beer. 
Each crystal glass had “The Boat” 
etched in modem script around both 
lip and base. The bottles were pro- 
duced by the company’s own brewery 
and proclaimed on their labels 
“Boat Bottling Company.” The bot- 
tles were miniature replicas of the 
vessel herself, with the cap going 
over the single funnel. Thus when 
used bottles were cast into the sea 
with other refuse they would be in- 
stantly identified by any beachcomb- 
er in the world, no matter on what 
deserted or remote beach they came 
to rest. 

Even, let it be noted, the lifeboats 
were Boatshaped. Not that it was 
thought there would ever be a need 
to employ them as safety devices, 
but because when the vessel was in a 
port they would show magnificently 
above the terminal buildings and be 
a further ' advertisement of the 
world’s most impressive ship. 

T here is an area of the ocean, 
quite near the coast, where in 
the course of the past twenty years 
strange events are presumed to have 
taken place. The right word is “pre- 
sumed” because no way has yet been 
found to make proof either for or 



against strangeness. It is a heavily 
travelled section of the sea, being 
near one of the world’s best-known 
resort cities, and is used daily by 
hundreds of airplanes and dozens 
of ships. 

Yet in the past twenty years sever- 
al of these ships and even more of 
these airplanes have ventured, into 
the area, as they have daily count- 
less times in the past, and then failed 
to emerge from it. 

The circumstances at any age 
would have been considered omi- 
nous. But in this day of highly ac- 
curate navigational aids, radio and 
radar, it is considerably more omi- 
nous than even those few who know 
of it realize, for those some dozen 
airplanes and probably six or eight 
ships and yachts have vanished in 
these few (no one knows for sure 
how many) square miles of ocean, 
and not one of them has so much 
as sent a simple distress call or ra- 
dioed back that anything out of the 
ordinary was occurring. They mere- 
ly sail or fly into the area and cease 
to exist. 

In one case no fewer than five 
military planes, flying in formation, 
vanished into this Unknown simul- 
taneously and were followed later 
by one of the planes of the search 
party sent after them. 

Of course no wreckage of ship 
or plane has ever been found. 

T he Unknown, or the Bahama 
Abyss as some have come to 
call it, seems to be very selective, 
claiming only two dozen or less of 
the tens of thousands of ships and 
planes which have traversed it (with- 



THE BOAT IN THE BOHIE

oult noticing anything unusual or sus- 
picious) regularly since the days of 
Ponce de Leon and before. Hordes 
of tourists, untold warehouses full 
of goods, many warships and even 
simple fishermen have passed un- 
harmed and unvanished through the 
Bahama Abyss. Of every million air 
or sea passages made through the 
Abyss area, statistically less than one 
vanishes. Yet that one continues to 
do so with an erratic regularity. 

In certain circles mudi interest 
has been taken in the Abyss. Insur- 
ance and transportation companies 
have investigated. So has the mili- 
tary, since besides the formation- 
plus-one lost on one occasion, be 
it noted that the atomic submarine 
which recently sank mysteriously in 
the North Atlantic passed through 
the area of the Abyss on her way 
from her last port of call to the spot 
where she went down. Some have 
suggested the Abyss misfired on that 
occasion, but had its victim in the 
end. 

Of all this interest nothing con- 
crete has come. Theories have been 
set forth, as theories will be, but 
they range from the fantastic (sea 
monsters) to the odd but possible (a 
field of some sort distorting the 
natural laws causing such things as 
gravity and radio to operate, set up 
perhaps by a hypothetical sunken 
cargo of some ore in which chemical 
changes have taken place). So far 
the only logically acceptable explana- 
tion ^advanced on the Bahama Abyss 
is that it is no abyss at all, only 
a strange but honest set of coinci- 
dences. 

As it happens, all explanations are 



equally incorrect. There is an Abyss, 
and an active one. 

Some force (the scientists are 
working on it even now, having the 
data from The Boat’s trip) acts upon 
ships and planes entering the area, 
if certain conditions exist. The con- 
ditions, if known, have not yet been 
announced. All that has been re- 
leased is that the force acts only 
upon machines of transportation, 
i.e., ships and planes, and their con- 
tents. Thus flotsam is not affected, 
nor are creatures of the sea. (As 
to the sea itself, it cannot be de- 
termined. After all, the ocean is a 
difficult thing to measure). 

But the logical explanation was 
accepted by most people who knew 
of the case and was accepted by the 
Board Members of the Boat Cor- 
poration, since they were (as The 
Boat amply demonstrated) rational 
men. 

Thus it came about that they 
caused much publicity to be given 
to the Bahama Abyss. Feature pages 
in the Sunday magazine sections 
carried installments for weeks. The 
magazines of several nations pub- 
lished articles, and pictures (of the 
missing planes or vessels or their 
type models), and all the theories, 
concentrating on the most implausi- 
ble. Of all the theories, one was sel- 
dom mentioned, that of coincidence, 
for it would not have suited the 
Board’s plans concerning The Boat. 
When it was of necessity mentioned, 
it was played down or ridiculed. A 
book was published, entitled The 
Secret of the Bahama Abyss. 

The Board Members planned this 
publicity campaign to coincide with 



154 



IF 




the final stages of the outfitting of 
The Boat, so that her maiden voy- 
age could be into, through, and out 
of, the Bahama Abyss. It was so 
planned that the builder’s trials took 
the ship to the resort city nearest 
the Abyss proper, and that the maid- 
en voyage should be a lengthy 
cruise through the crucial area and 
on to Europe. It was to be a luxury 
voyage, land reports were to be sent 
to the waiting millions of The Boat’s 
progress. Her owners, having no 
doubts of the explanation of the 
Abyss, had no anxiety over her trip, 
and the Board Members and their 
families were the first to be entered 
on the passenger list (pot, be it 
noted. Traveller Class, but Premiere 
Classe). 

And so it happened. The publicity 
campaign, both as regards the Abyss 
and The Boat’s intended voyage 
through it and the final trials runs 
of the ship came simultaneously. The 
gala pre-sailing balls and parties were 
held, with representatives from the 
world’s press flashing bulbs and 
making notes, the baggage was load- 
ed, immigration officials were put 
at ease and the time for sailing came. 

T he actual sailing was at sunset. 

The three thousand passengers 
had been aboard since midafter- 
noon, and' at least triple that num- 
ber (newspapers put it even higher) 
cheered on the pier as the lines were 
cast off and the tugboats moved 
the noble vessel into the channel and 
the open sea. 

The two thousand crewmen, from 
the six fully qualified captains to the 
innumerable cabin boys, served The 



Boat and her passengers at peak ef- 
ficien^cy, joyful to sail the world’s 
most famous (and impressive) ship 
on the world’s most talked-about 
voyage. The nine Board Members 
and their families glowed in pride as 
they absorbed every drop of excite- 
ment. 

Once the mainland was lost to 
view and The Boat was enclosed by 
clean horizons, festive dinner was 
served, if possible more festive even 
than the most extravagant of the 
Bon Voyage dinners. In the Pre- 
miere Classe Dining Room and bars 
much champagne was consumed, 
and in the Traveller Class quarters, 
much whiskey and beer. Wine flow- 
ed by the cask as each captain tried 
to outdo the others in compliments. 

The plan was to approach the 
boundary of the Abyss (as everyone 
called it, to dissuade which none of 
the Board Members said a word) by 
night and then, once full daylight 
had come and the sun was high in 
the east, enter it full steam at the 
whole forty knots in The Boat’s en- 
gines. Once at the probable center 
of the area they would stop the en- 
gines, drift silently with whatev^ 
breezes and currents might be foun 
and celebrate their conquering o 
the Abyss with a lavish party. 

The night passed in revelry, bu 
most of the pasengers and as man 
of the crew as could be spared fror- 
duty retired by midnight or short 1 
after to be on hand when the mo- 
ment came. 

When the dawn arrived, early, 
bright and bellclear, as is usual in 
tropical waters, the decks were 
crowded to the rails. The early risers 



THE BOAT IN THE BOTTLE 



155 




had arranged the deck chairs to their 
liking, and the later comers stood 
in packs around and behind them, 
all straining to discern any move- 
ment or shape on the horizon or in 
the water by the side. The nine Board 
Members were on the starboard Fly- 
ing Bridge with a captain to advise 
them. The captain in command had 
taken the wheel himself. The re- 
maining four captains occupied the 
port Flying Bridge. Every crewman 
who could find a porthole or inch 
of deckspace was, with the com- 
mander’s permission, on attentive 
watch. 

At the appointed moment the 
conunander spun the wheel, gave 
orders to the engine room for full 
speed ahead and steered The Boat 
confidently into The Bahama Abyss. 

T he commander saw with satis- 
faction that the sea and sky, 
the weather in short, was absolute 
perfection. The Board Members 
noted the fact also. The Boat would 
not have to report so much as a fog 
or a one-foot sea for her passage 
of the Abyss. 

So much the better for her repu- 
tation and fame. The weather was 
in fact a cliche: the sky lacked even 
the suggestion of a cloud, and the 
ocean was calmer than whatever mill- 
pond sea-travellers so often men- 
tion. The Boat slid across the water 
with the smoothness of a warm knife 
cutting* butter, and the sky was brit- 
tle in its clarity. If there was any- 
thing to be reported (which of 
course there wouldn’t be, since the 
disappearances were coincidences in- 
volving unseaworthy or unairworthy 



ships or planes, and The Boat was 
more seaworthy even than the Ti- 
tanic had claimed to be), observa- 
tion of it would not have been ham- 
pered by the weather. Actually only 
the more imaginative of the passen- 
gers and the more superstitious of 
the crew expected anything worthy 
of observation, aside from the sheer 
beauty of the ship and (it must be 
said) of the day’s run. The com- 
mander exulted in his vessel, while 
the other captains secretly wished 
sickness on him that they might take 
command. The Board Members 
watched either the sea or the pas- 
sengers with vague and vacant ex- 
pressions. One or two of them even 
went so far as to be dreaming of a 
successor to The Boat which would 
be even greater and more impressive, 
then abandoned the dream on con- 
sideration of the difficulty of finding 
a name for the world to call it. 

Whatever their unspoken thoughts, 
the five thousand people on The Boat 
sailed peacefully into the Bahama 
Abyss. As was fitting for the por- 
tentuous occasion, an occasion for 
which they had paid large sums to 
either travel agents or union officials, 
an occasion for which the rest of 
the world bad been prepared by 
reams measured in the hundreds of 
thousands of publicity, there was no 
sound from human throat. The en- 
gines of The Boat gargled in a mur- 
mur, and the parted seas hissed along 
the sides of the world’s most impres- 
sive ship. Long since the gulls from 
the harbor had returned after scav- 
enging the garbage cast overboard 
from the festival. Five thousand peo- 
ple breathed as quietly as they could. 



156 



IF 




and the fabled ship bore them with 
steady and as-advertised power. 

Fifteen minutes after swinging 
The Boat onto the preplanned 
course the commander called the 
next senior captain to the wheel, 
then stepped to a microphone to 
proclaim their course, speed and 
elapsed time to the waiting thou- 
sands. The silence all but glittered 
as breaths were held and the com- 
mander’s voice boomed from every 
cleverly concealed loudspeaker in 
The Boat’s decor. At the end of his 
terse announcement five thousand 
voices cheered as one (for even the 
commander allowed his exultation 
to become mildly vocal). The unison 
roar reached to the horizon, which 
did not echo. 

Once broken, the silence was not 
regained. The cheer dissolved into 
the babble, then subsided to the mur- 
mur, of hundreds of conversations. 
Most passengers remained on deck, 
but a few drifted into the bars and 
lounges. As the minutes went by, 
more and more went inside to drink 
to the successful bearding by The 
Boat of the Abyss in its den. The 
Board Members and the captains 
opened a ‘boam of supreme cham- 
pagne (the commander turning the 
ship over to a glistening Mate), and 
the crewmen returned to their posts. 

B y ten o’clock, one hour later, 
laughter and merrymaking dis- 
pelled even the memory of the ear- 
lier silence. A few adventure-loving 
passengers still searched the horizon, 
but most remaining on deck had all 
but forgotten the romance of the 
hour before. The routine of a 



luxury liner at sea (if so young a 
ship as The Boat can be said to have 
developed a routine) was settled 
into by everyone. 

At eleven o’clock midmorning cof- 
fee was served in the lounges and 
on the decks. Jokes about the Abyss 
had run their course, and all but 
two of those on the ship had begun 
to forget the whole matter. Those 
two were the commander, whb was 
making an entry in the log book, 
and the radio operator' who, at th : 
behest of the commander (in turr 
at the behest of the Chairman of the 
Board), was sending a complete re 
port of the successful running of t ' 
Abyss to the home offices, the new , 
services and the world. 

In the kitchens the employees we: e 
halfway through their preparations 
for the midday meal. The noon posi- 
tion was taken and duly noted in log 
book and charts (both navigational 
and passengers’). The weather had 
not changed, though a slight sea, a 
gentle and extremely prolonged swell, 
had developed. This was noted in 
the log, somewhat improperly in 
the kitchens, and subconsciously else- 
where. 

When lunch was served in the 
Dining Rooms at one o’clock, the 
rolling of the ship had become quite 
noticeable, and when after-lunch cof- 
fee was served an hour later it was 
necessary to raise the restraining 
borders on the tables to keep the 
dishes from sliding to the floor. 

Through the next two hours the 
seas continued to become larger, 
but were causing no major discom- 
fort. The commandbr made mention 
of it in the four o’clock log entry, 



THE BOAT IN THE BOHLE 



157 




as well as of the fact that the sky 
remained transparently cloudless. 

By five o’clock some concern, or 
rather interest, had been generated 
on the Bridge by the now quite large 
swells. They were of considerable 
interest because they were so large, 
yet so long and broad. While they 
lifted The Boat with sonorous regu- 
larity, they came no faster than one 
each minute, if that. The swells were 
unlike anything in the experience of 
any of the six captains assembled 
in discussion. It was as though the 
ocean were heaving great, deep 
sighs. 

But the cause of the discussion was 
not itihe peculiar swells so much as 
the strange item which had been in- 
creasingly visible for the past hour 
overtaking them in their wake. 

It seemed, visually, to be a ship. 
But no answer was received from 
the repeated messages broadcast 
from Ae radio room. Binoculars 
provided only one further bit of in- 
formation about the following ves- 
sel, and that was the fact that she 
seemed to be green. It was thought 
by four of the captains to be an 
optical illusion produced by the now 
beginning to set sun, and a halluci- 
nation by the other two. 

T he most disturbing thing about 
the ship in their wake was that 
no two estimates as to her distance 
agreed, and none agreed with the 
radar report of fifty-five miles 
(which all six captains agreed was 
totally impossible — at that distance 
she would be invisible). Either she 
was much farther away than she 
seemed, or much closer. 



The stranger was causing idle 
comment among many of the pas- 
sengers, but few had enough sea ex- 
perience to recognize the problems 
she (raised. Those who did merely 
shrugged and ordered more Boat 
Battling Company beer. 

When six o’clock arrived, how- 
ever, the ship was abuzz with gen- 
eral comment and even consterna- 
tion. The Bridge was in a state of 
orderly panic. The following ship 
seemed to be larger than The Boat 
(which was physically impossible). 
It was now evident that she was in- 
deed wholly and totally green, from 
funnel to waterline. Whatever vessel 
she might turn out to be (she still 
answered no radio messages), she 
was built on the lines of a luxury 
liner. The wireless operator had re- 
ported her to the shore, as the com- 
mander had instructed, but for the 
past hour and a half no radio mes- 
sages had been received at all, which 
had caused the dismantling of one 
wireless, the employment of another 
and an inspection of the aerials. 

Furthermore, and no one but the 
most drunken of the passengers 
would say it aloud, she seemed to be 
transparent. 

This more or less irrelevant fact 
was causing more consternation on 
the Bridge than her size, distance 
and identification problems. No ship 
was bigger than The Boat, and cer- 
tainly none was at the same time 
green and transparent. Everyone was 
now watching the strange sight in 
their wake with as great an apprehen- 
sion as nine o’clock had been met. 
The watchers were either silent, as 
in the morning, or excitedly babbling. 



158 



IF 




as dieir various temperaments, du- 
ties, and states of sobriety dictated. 

T hen, as they watched, the huge 
ship behind them heeled slug- 
gishly and rolled over onto her 
port side. 

It was an awful and majestic sight. 
The captains, frozen to their binocu- 
lars, saw that no boats were lowered, 
no survivors leapt into the sea. Es- 
timates differed wildly as to her prob- 
able distance (radar having been so 
obviously wrong that the sets had 
been taken apart by electricans for 
inspection), but the commander im- 
mediately put The Boat about and 
steamed at full speed toward the 
stranger to offer his assistance. 

Time seemed to have frozen con- 
gealed around The Boat. The com- 
mander ordered a radar reading on 
the stranger, sent further unacknowl- 
edged radio messages to her, and re- 
turned to his binoculars. 

At seven o’clock a radar set had 
been blasphemously reassembled by 
the technicians, and a report of the 
stranger’s distance was telephoned 
to the commander, who gasped, be- 
gan to tremble, ordered the radar 
sets destroyed completely and then 
disintegrated. 

The next senior captain took com- 
mand, had the previous commander 
restrained and removed, and tried, 
too late, to countermand the destruc- 
tion order. The chief radar operator 
was able, however, to repeat the 
reading which had disintegrated the 
former commander. The senior cap- 
tain thereupon calculated for a mo- 
ment on a scratch pad and inform- 
ed his four fellows that if both ra- 



dar and visual observations were 
correct, the capsized stranger was 
approximately thirteen miles long 
and three miles high. A junior cap- 
tain refused to accept this and, on 
inspecting the scratch pad calcula- 
tions, disintegrated screaming the 
same phrases the first commander 
had used. 

It was now evident to all, even 
the Board Members, that something 
incredible was at hand, for as they 
steamed at full speed toward the 
stricken monster it became obvious 
that the stranger was indeed much 
larger than The Boat. The most ac- 
curate calculations, in fact, placed 
her length at approximately thirty- 
five times that of the world’s most 
impressive ship. 

But far more disturbing than her 
size was the fact that she was green, 
transparent and imoccupied. She had, 
capsized, swung around so that her 
superstructure was visible from The 
Boat. Her lines were strangely round- 
ed and blurred, as though in a fog. 
No distinct features could be dis- 
cerned. And no, absolutely no, hu- 
man activity could be seen. By now 
she was so near — less than a mile 
some said — that even her smallest 
features were too large to be taken 
in by the eye. She simply and mon- 
olitWcally overwhelmed the tiny 
Boat. 

Then a new current usurped the 
power of the mysterious swell. While 
the swell was tremendous, requir- 
ing The Boat to chmb for thirty or 
forty seconds up one slope and then 
down another, the new current was 
not so friendly. It was set up by the 
capsized monster ship, for when her 



THE BOAT IN THE BOTTLE 



159 




funnel touched the water the ocean 
made a determined attempt to rush 
bodily into her innards. 

Though she tried every evasive 
maneuver known to her remaining 
four captains, The Boat was slowly 
and majestically drawn into the full 
rush of that current. 

With irresistible force. The Boat 
was swept through the monster fun- 
nel and into the green transparence. 

O ne hour later an immense net- 
work of almost a thousand 
ships and planes was searching the 
Bahama Abyss for some sign of The 
Boat. This vast search operation had 
been planned quietly even before 
The Boat sailed, and when no radio 
messages were received from her 
after about four o’clock in the after- 
noon, at eight o’clock the search was 
begun. Since The Boat was equipped 
in triplicate with the latest in radio 
equipment it was assumed that her 
four--hour silence was due to more 
than mechanical failure. When the 
silence stretched to eight hours 
(midnight of the fatal day), and 
when by that time neither search 
ship nor search plane had located 
her (despite their having accurate 
copies of her planned course and her 
reported positions up to and includ- 
ing four that afternoon), the worst 
was assumed. No public announce- 
ment, however, was made. The 
search was quietly continued. 

At ten the next morning, when 
it became (after five hours of day- 
light) evident that no Boat was go- 
ing to be found, the planes were 
called in. The ships were given in- 
structions to search now for wreck- 



age. Even small pieces of flotsam 
were ordered to be gently and care- 
fully picked up, stored in tanks of 
sea water, and returned to shore for 
chemical and radioactive analysis. 

And so it was that a search ship, 
at four-thirty that following after- 
noon (24^ hours after The Boat’s 
final and strictly routine radio mes- 
sage was received, and approximate- 
ly 21^ hours after she was sucked 
through that gigantic green funnel), 
very gently and very carefully re- 
moved a beer bottle from the sea. 
It was assumed, even certain, to be 
refuse cast overboard from the liner, 
since it was (though the label had 
soaked off) a bottle from the Boat 
Bottling Company. This was evident 
from the shape, that of The Boat 
herself. 

The bottle was found floating 
within two miles of the reported 
position of The Boat at the previous 
afternoon’s four o’clock sighting. 

T he explanation of the Bahama 
Abyss began to break on the 
world when the seaman who actually 
plucked the bottle from the water 
observed that a piece of debris rough- 
ly one-third of an inch long had 
found its way into the bottle through 
the top (disguised as a ship’s fun- 
nel). He noted that, furthermore, it 
seemed to be carved into a miniature 
replica of The Boat herself, and im- 
mediately reported to his superior. 

Subsequent measurement proved 
this seaman’s find in the bottle to be 
0.266247558559375 inches long. 

Of The Boat, and of the Bahama 
Abyss, nothing further has ever been 
proved. END

one of those. Let's start with a base- 
ball. The conventional view says 
when you throw it you add kinetic 
energy in the amount %mv2. An- 
other and more accurate way to 
look at it is that in the process of 
accelerating it you add to its mass. 
You pump in energy and it shows 
up as mass. When the ball hits a 
brick wall and stops dead the extra 
mass turns back into energy which 
shows up as heat, cracks in the wall 
and whatnot. So back to the proton. 
When you accelerate it you pump 
energy into it and the energy shows 
up as a relativistic mass increase. 
You might say you are turning en- 
ergy into matter. So even with a 
proton you need infinite energy to 
get to the speed of light. Even with 



an electron. (A better way to say 
it would be that for any specified 
finite energy input, no matter how 
large, the velocity imparted to the 
object will be less than the speed of 
light.) 

So what about photons? To square 
with the above rules, the physicist 
make a definition that the photon 
has no rest mass. In other words, it 
ain't matter. Along with that, you 
will never observe a photon going 
slower than the speed of light. If 
you don't mind the angruished 
screams from the mathmeticians, 
you can say this illustrates the rule 
that zero (the rest mass) times in- 
finity (the relativistic mass in- 
crease) equals an ordinary number 
(the mass that shows up because 
the photon is affected by a gravity 
field.) 

Now, in anticipation I would like 
to shoot down some other goodies 
that people have confused the scene 
with now and again. Suppose we 
have a rocket with a perfect matter 
converter for a drive. Say it can 
give 1 gravity for 100 years. (The 
design is a mere engineering prob- 
lem.) No matter how fast it goes, 
from its standpoint it is standing 



161 



still, so it can g-o faster. From the 
viewpoint of an observer standing 
still (accelerating with respect to 
the ship) the ship^s drive suffers 
no impairment, because as it goes 
faster it has more matter to turn 
into energy. So how come it can’t 
go faster than light? The dilation 
comes to the rescue. Relative to the 
ship, acceleration is constant at 1 g. 
The ship is always standing still 
relative ito itself, so there is no prob- 
lem. The other observer sees ship 
time slowing down as the ship’s vel- 
ocity approaches that of light, and 
consequently the acceleration also 
slacks off, lapproaching zero sym- 
ptotically as the velocity goes up. 

One more. What about non-uni- 
form acceleration? Despite old chest- 
nuts to the contrary, the special 
theory of relativity holds perfectly 
well for non-uniform accelerations. 
In many cases the actual computa- 
tions can get a bit hairy, but the 
rules are still there, and every bit 
as valid. You need to go to the mis- 
named general theory only when 
you insist on throwing gravitational 
fields into the misch on the same 
par with other types of accelera- 
tion. 

So much for that. I like your mag- 
azine. It reminds me of the old 
Thrilling twins. Lately I’ve even 
been buying it regularly. — Leon-

Dear Editor: 

I have been reading If for only 
about a year and I’ve wondered why 
people wrote in saying how much If 
has improved and to keep up the 
good work. (I discovered why when 
I ordered back issues of If. Oh, 



brother!) But I must enter my plea 
for you not to get too good. What 
are pulps for if not to develop new 
writers besides offering stories by 
well-established authors? 

I would like to say that your book 
reviewer, Algis Budrys, is my fav- 
orite sf reviewer. I like someone 
whose opinions run fairly parallel 
to mine. 

Now, I’m going to make one of 
those lists that you never publish 
in Hue and Cry (But the kind of 
list that you need, nevertheless.) I 
give you my favorite authors: (1) 
van Vogt (Of course! Plus Heinlein 
and all the other obvious ones.) (2) 
Fred Saberhagen. (3) C. C. Mac- 
App. (4) Mark Philips (Laurence 
M. Janifer or Randall Garrett, if 
you will.) (5) Avram Davidson. (6) 
Murray Leinster. (7) Clifford Si- 
mak. 

I think someone should compile a 
list of aU science-fiction writers 
and the pen names used by each. 
Pen names give me a pain.

Dear Editor: 

I would appreciate receiving an 
answer to the following question 
through the readers’ column of If 
In the Fall, 1946 issue of Thrilling 
Wonder Stories there appeared a 
novelette called The Multillionth 
Chance by John Russell Fearn. Does 
anyone recall the plot of the story, 
and in particular the definitions of 
the word “multillionth” as it ap- 
pears therein? — Rudolph W. Cas- 
town, 142 Manhattan Avenue, New 
York, New York 10025.

The only thing we know about tomorrow 
is that it has its roots today. And out of the 
fantastic facts of today's scientific wonders 
Gataxy's all-star lineup of contributors weave 
stories that are sometimes wry, sometimes ter- 
rifying— but always a delight to read. 

Would you like to join us, next issue and 
every issue thereafter for years to come, on 
this fascinating exploration of the fears and 
foibles of tomorrow? All it takes is a check, a 
Stamp and a minute of your time. (If you pre- 
fer not to tear the coupon out of your maga- 
zine, just give us the information requested on 
a plain piece of paper.) From then on the mails 
will bring Galaxy to your door, with the best 
stories being written by the best science-fiction 
writers of all time. 

Here are some of the famous stories that 
appeared in Galaxy in its first fifteen years. 
Will the next fifteen years be as good? 

Frankly, we don't think so. We think they'll 
be better!
