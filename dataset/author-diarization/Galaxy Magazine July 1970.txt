Whatever happened to 




DMIIETICS? 

In May 1950, a brilliant American writer, philosopher and 
Scientist shattered forever the myths and barriers surrounding the 
unknown territory of the Human Mind. 

L. Ron Hubbard’s Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health 
struck the English-speaking world like a thunderbolt. This best 
selling book heralded the breakthrough sought by Man for over 2000 
years, the discovery and identification of the source of psycho- 
somatic ills, human aberration, unhappy interpersonal relationships 
and the technique to eradicate it! 

Many promises were made. Man could rid himself of all unwanted 
emotions, conditions and aberrations. He could attain higher states 
of existence and ability only dreamed about for centuries. 

Man could be totally free. 

Today, all the promises have been kept.

DIANETICS IN 1950 

Dianetics was first announced to the 
public in a popular science fiction maga- 
zine in 1950. Without formal training or 
an organization, the superior technology 
in the first book made Dianetics tremen- 
dously popular. Informal groups mush- 
roomed ail over the country and hun- 
dreds of thousands actively applied Dia- 
netic techniques with amazing results. 

Mental upset and psychosomatic ills 
vanished and miracles were commonplace. 

L. Ron Hubbard continued his re- 
search to improve the already excellent 
results from Dianetic technology and 
went far beyond. He created training 
methods far superior to existing systems 
and founded an organization to service 
the huge demand for the first truly work- 
able technology of the human mind. 

Finally in 1966 he completed his re- 
search on the full route to the state of 
CLEAR and TOTAL FREEDOM.

L. Ron Hubbard presents Scientology's 
GRAND NATIONAL CONVENTION OF THE 20TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF DIANETICS & TOTAL FREEDOM 
July 3rd, 4th and 5th at the west's most beautiful and mod- 
ern convention center. The LONG BEACH ARENA, Long 
Beach California. 

Here is the complete story of the tremendous growth of 
Dianetics and its evolution into Scientology, its amazing 
technology and the culmination of 20 years of "miracles 
beyond belief." Plan now to attend this event. i 



DIANETICS TODAY 

Today we have Scientology (study of 
knowledge) which was the inevitable re- 
sult of L. Ron Hubbard’s advanced re- 
search into the mind. Scientology goes 
beyond the mind into the realm of the 
human spirit. 

Dianetics was only part of the answer 
and now, with Scientology techniques, 
Dianetics is 100% workable. 

Dianetics takes a person up to a well 
and happy human being. Scientology 
goes beyond to higher states of existence. 
Scientology is far more popular than Dia- 
netics ever was alone. 

Today hundreds of Scientology Cen- 
ters and organizations circle the globe 
and Scientologists number in the millions. 
Scientology doubles every year.

ASBESTOS, TOO 

If society persists in its present 
course the future holds great peril, 
whether from the uncontrolled effects 
of technology itself or from an un- 
reasoned political reaction against 
technological innovation — a reac- 
tion that could condemn mankind to 
poverty, frustration and the loss of 
freedom . 

The above is the conclusion reached 
by a panel convened by the National 
Academy of Sciences to assess the ef- 
fects of technology on the 'condition 
of Earth and Man. The report, pub- 
lished in Scientific American, Feb- 
ruary 1970, noted in passing that “As- 
bestos is so diversely useful that it 
has found its way into every automo- 
bile, train, airplane, factory and home 
and thence into human lungs, where, 
remaining as indestructible as it is in 
nature, it can cause grave disease.” 

Some of the yodels against ecologi- 
cal damage caused by technological 
evolution — by persons who have just 
now looked up the definitions of the 
words — do have an asbestos rasp and 
suggest serious illness. Coast to coast, 
demonstrations have urged unlikely 
if not impossible reversals in the con- 
dition of Man. Some featured sledge- 
hammer assaults on unmanned auto- 
mobiles — first pollutingly driven to the 
scene. Others launched indiscriminate 
broadsides at electric and other indus- 
tries without which modern man — 
and the demonstrators themselves — 
would probably refuse to survive. 

Back-to-nature proposals tend to 
run out of steam — perhaps because 
we are part of nature. The artificial 
homo sapiens is an invention still wait- 
ing to happen — a creation of philoso- 

2 



phers and fictioneers. Animals and 
predators we are — so ruthless that we 
have in fact become our own most 
dangerous environment. 

For those who prefer a long-term 
and more more constructive attack on 
the very real problems confronting us, 
this issue of GALAXY brings two 
views of Man’s possible ecological fu- 
ture. 

One is Robert Silverberg’s novel- 
ette, THE THROWBACKS (page 
26). CONTAINERS FOR THE 
CONDITION OF MAN (page 65) 
covers a recent exhibit in Washington, 
D.C. under sponsorship of the Depart- 
ment of Urban Housing and Develop- 
ment and the Prudential Insurance 
Company. 

The exhibit, titled “The Architec- 
tural Vision of Paolo Soleri,” attract- 
ed major attention in leading archi- 
tectural journals as well as mass me- 
dia — and the remarkable thing is that 
Messrs. Silverberg and Soleri, work- 
ing independently and unaware of each 
other, reached similar visions of hu- 
man tomorrows. 

Both men see an erect society, sin- 
gle-structure cities towering tall as 
the mountains, freeing the rest of the 
global surface to wilderness and agri- 
culture and providing Technological 
Man with all his needs and wants. Sil- 
verberg, pessimistically, sees a society 
so tightly organized that it’s impossi- 
ble for any human to say no to anoth- 
er — and proper punishment is given 
those who do. 

Soleri’s view is sunnier — perhaps as 
befits a man working with structural 
materials. Neither Silverberg nor Sol- 
eri pretends to present final answers 
to Man’s future on Earth — each inde-

T he room was old-fashioned, 
1980 baroque, but it was wide, 
long, high, and luxurious. Near 
simulated view windows stood an 
automated hospital bed. It looked 
out of place but was largely con- 
cealed by a magnificent Chinese 
screen. Forty feet from it a board- 
room table also failed to match 
the decor. At the head of this table 
was a life-support wheelchair; 
wires and tubings ran from it to 
the bed. 

Near the wheelchair, at a mobile 
stenodesk crowded with directional 
mikes, voice typewriter, clock-cal- 
endar, controls, and the usual an- 
cillaries, a young woman sat. She 
was beautiful. 

Her manner was that of the per- 
fect unobtrusive secretary but she 
was dressed in a current exotic 
mode, “Half & Half’ — right 

shoulder and breast and arm con- 
cealed in jet-black knit, left leg 
sheathed in a scarlet tight, panty- 
ruffle in both colors joining them, 
black sandal on the scarlet side, 
red sandal on her bare right foot. 
Her skin paint was patterned in the 
same scarlet and black. 

On the other side of the wheel- 
chair was an older woman garbed 
in a nurse’s conventional white 
pantyhose and smock. She ignored 
everything but her dials and a pa- 
tient in the chair. Seated around 
the table were a dozen-odd men, 
most of them in spectator-sports 
style affected by older executives. 

Cradled in the life-support chair 
was a very old man. Except for 
restless eyes, he looked like a poor 
job of embalming. No cosmetic 



help had been used to soften the 
brutal fact of his decrepitude. 

“Ghoul,” he was saying softly 
to a man halfway down the table. 
“You’re a slavering ghoul. Parky, 
me boy. Didn’t your father teach 
you that it is polite to wait for a 
man to stop kicking before you 
bury him? Or did you have a fa- 
ther? Erase that last, Eunice. Gen- 
tlemen, Mr. Parkinson has moved 
that I be invited to resign as chair- 
man of the board. Do I hear a 
second?” 

He waited, looking from face to 
face, then said, “Oh, come now! 
Who is letting you down. Parky? 
You, George?” 

“I had nothing to do with it.” 

“But you would love to vote 
‘Aye.’ Motion fails for want of a 
second.” 

“I withdraw my motion.” 

“Too late, Parkinson; Erasures 
are made only by unanimous con- 
sent, implied or overt. One objec- 
tion is enough — and I, Johann Se- 
bastian Bach Smith, do so object 
. and that rule controls because 
I wrote it before you learned to 
read. 

“But — ” Smith looked around 
at the others — “I do have news. As 
you heard from Mr. Teal, all our 
divisions are in satisfactory shape; 
Sea Ranches and General Text- 
books are more than satisfactory 
— so this is a good time for me to 
retire.” 

Smith waited, then said, “You 
can close your mouths. Don’t 
look smug. Parky; I have more 
news for you. I stay on as chair- 
man of the board but will no long- 
er be chief executive. Our chief 
counsel, Mr. Jake Salomon, be-

GALAXY 




comes deputy chairman and — ” 

“Hold it, Johann. I am not go- 
ing to manage this five-ring 
circus.” 

“Nobody said you would, Jake. 
But you can preside at board 
meetings when I’m not available. 
Is that too much to ask?” 

“Mmm, I suppose not.” 

“Thank you. I’m resigning as 
president of Smith Enterprises, and 
Mr. Byram Teal becomes our 
president and chief executive offi- 
cer — he’s doing the work; it’s time 
he got the title — and pay and stock 
options and all the perks and privi- 
leges and tax loopholes. No more 
than fair.” 

Parkinson said, “Now see here. 
Smith!” 

“Hold it, youngster. Don’t start 
a remark to me with ‘Now see 
here — ’ Address me as ‘Mr. Smith’ 
or ‘Mr. Chairman.’ What is your 
point?” 

Parkinson controlled himself, 
then said, “Very well. Mister 
Smith. I can’t accept this. Quite 
aside from promoting your assis- 
tant to the office of president in 
one jump — utterly unheard of — if 
there is a change in management, / 
must be considered. I represent the 
second largest block of voting 
stock.” 

“I did consider you for presi- 
dent, Parky.” 

“You did?” 

“Yep. I thought about it . and 
snickered.” 

“Why, you — ” 

“Don’t say it — I might sue. 
What you forget is that my block 
has voting control. Now about 
your block — By company policy 
anyone representing five percent or 

I WILLFEAR NO EVIL 



more of voting stock is automat- 
ically on the board even if nobody 
loves him and he suffers from spir- 
itual bad breath. Which describes 
both you and me. 

“Or did describe you. Byram, 
what’s the late word on proxies 
and stock purchases?” 

“A full report, Mr. Smith?” 

“No, just tell Mr. Parkinson 
where he stands.” 

“Yes,, sir. Mr. Parkinson, you 
now control less than five percent 
of the voting stock.” 

Smith added sweetly, “So you’re 
fired, you young ghoul. Jake, call 
a special stockholders meeting, 
legal notice, all formalities, for the 
purpose of giving Parky a gold 
watch and kicking him out — and 
electing his successor. Further bus- 
iness? None. Meeting’s adjourned. 
Stick around, Jake. You, too, Eu- 
nice. And Byram, if you have any- 
thing on your mind.” 

Parkinson jumped to his feet. 
“Smith, you haven’t heard the last 
of this!” 

“Oh, no doubt,” the old man 
said sweetly. “Meantime, my re- 
spects to your mother-in-law and 
tell her that Byram will go on 
making her rich even though I’ve 
fired you.” 

P ARKINSON left abruptly. 

Others started to leave. Smith 
said mildly, “Jake, how does a 
man get to be fifty years old with- 
out acquiring horse sense? Only 
smart thing that lad ever did was 
pick a rich mother-in-law. Yes, 
Hans?” 

“Johann,” Hans von Ritter said, 
leaning on the table and speaking 
directly to the chairman, “I did 



7 




not like your treatment of Parkin- 
son.” 

.“Thanks. You’re honest with 
me to my face. Scarce these days.” 
“Removing him from the board 
is okay; he’s an obstructionist. 
But there was no need to humiliate 
him.” 

“I suppose not. One of my little 
pleasures, Hans. I don’t have 
many these days.” 

A Simplex footman rolled in, 
hung the vacated chairs on a rack, 
rolled out; von Ritter continued: 
“7 have no intention of being treat- 
ed that way. If you want nothing 
but yes-men on your board, let us 
note that I control much less than 
five percent of the voting stock. 
Do you want my resignation?” 
“Good God, no! I need you, 
Hans — and Byram will need you 
still more. I can’t use trained seals; 
a man has to have the guts to dis- 
agree with me or he’s a waste of 
space. But when a man bucks me, 
I want him to do it intelligently. 
You do. You’ve forced me to 
change my mind several times — 
not easy, stubborn as I am. Now 
about this other — sit down. Eu- 
nice, whistle up that easy chair 
for Dr. von Ritter.” 

The chair approached; von Rit- 
ter waved it back, it retreated. 
“No, I haven’t time to be cajoled. 
What do you want?” He straight- 
ened up; the boardroom table fold- 
ed its legs, turned on edge and 
glided away through a slot in the 
wall. 

“Hans, I’ve surrounded myself 
with men who don’t like me, not a 
yes-man or a trained seal among 
them. Even Byram — especially By- 
ram — got his job by contradicting 



me and being right. Except when 
he’s been wrong and that’s why he 
needs men like you on the board. 
But Parkinson — I was entitled to 
clip him — publicly — because he 
called for my resignation — public- 
ly. Nevertheless you are right, 
Hans; tit for tat is childish. Twen- 
ty years ago — even ten — I would 
never have humiliated a man. If a 
man operates by reflex, as most 
do instead of using their noggins, 
humiliating him forces him to try 
to get even. I know better. But I’m 
getting senile, as we all know.” 

Von Ritter said nothing. Smith 
went on, “Will you stick? And 
help keep Byram steady?” 

“Uh . I’ll stick. As long as 
you behave yourself.” He turned 
to leave. 

“Fair enough. Hans? Will you 
dance at my wake?” 

Von Ritter looked back and 
grinned. “I’d be delighted!” 

“Thought so. Thanks, Hans. 
G’bye.” 

Smith said to Byram Teal, 
“Anything, son?” 

“Assistant Attorney General 
coming from Washington tomor- 
row to talk to you about our Ma- 
chine Tools Division buying con- 
trol of Homecrafts, Ltd. I 
think — ” 

“To talk to you. If you can’t 
handle him I picked the wrong 
man. What else?” 

“At Sea Ranch number five we 
lost a man at the fifty-fathom line. 
Shark.” 

“Married?” 

“No, sir. Nor dependent par- 
ents.” 

“Well, do the pretty thing, what- 
ever it is. You have those video- 



8 



GALAXY 




spools of me, the ones that actor 
fellow dubbed the sincere voice on- 
to. When we lose one of our own 
we can’t have the public thinking 
we don’t give a hoot.” 

Jake Salomon added, “Especial- 
ly when we don’t.” 

Smith clucked at him. “Jake, do 
you have a way to look into my 
heart? It’s our policy to be lavish 
with death benefits, plus the little 
things that mean so much.” 

“ — and look so good. Johann, 
you don’t have a heart — ^just dials 
and machinery. Furthermore, you 
never did have.” 

Smith smiled. “Jake, for you 
we’ll make an exception. When 
you die, we’ll try not to notice. 
No flowers, not even the custom- 
ary black-bordered page in our 
house organs.” 

“You won’t have anything to 
say about it, Johann. I’ll outlive 
you twenty years.” 

“Going to dance at my wake?” 

“I don’t dance,” the lawyer an- 
swered, “but you tempt me to 
learn.” 

“Don’t bother. I’ll outlive you. 
Want to bet? Say a million to your 
favorite tax deduction? No, I can’t 
bet; I need your help to stay alive. 
Byram, check with me tomorrow. 
Nurse, leave us. I want to talk 
with my lawyer.” 

“No, sir. Dr. Garcia wants a 
close watch on you at all times.” 
Smith looked thoughtful. “Miss 
Bedpan, I acquired my speech hab- 
its before the Supreme Court took 
up writing dirty words on side- 
walks. But I will try to use words 
plain enough for you to under- 
stand. I am your employer. I pay 
your wages. This is my home. I 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



told you to get out. That’s an or- 
der.” 

The nurse looked stubborn, said 
nothing. 

Smith sighed. “Jake, I’m getting 
old — I forget that they follow their 
own rules. Will you locate Dr. 
Garcia — somewhere in the house — 
and find out how you and I can 
have a private conference in spite 
of this too-faithful watch dog?” 
Shortly Dr. Garcia arrived, 
looked over dials and patient, con- 
ceded that telemetering would do 
for the time being. “Miss Macin- 
tosh, shift to the remote displays.” 
“Yes, Doctor. Will you send for 
a nurse to relieve me? I want to 
quit this assignment.” 

“Now, Nurse — ” 

“Just a moment. Doctor,” 
Smith put in. “Miss Macintosh, I 
apologize for calling you ‘Miss 
Bedpan.’ Childish of me, another 
sign of increasing senility. But, 
Doctor, if she must leave — I hope 
she won’t — bill me for a thousand- 
dollar bonus for her. Her atten- 
tion to duty has been perfect . 
despite many instances of unrea- 
sonable behavior on my part.” 

“Uh — see me outside. Nurse.” 

W HEN doctor and nurse had 
left Salomon said dryly, “Jo- 
hann, you are senile only when it 
suits you.” 

Smith chuckled. “I do take ad- 
vantage of age and illness. What 
other weapons have I left?” 
“Money.” 

“Ah, yes. Without money I 
wouldn’t be alive. But I am child- 
ishly bad-tempered these days. 
You could chalk it up to the fact 
that a man who has always been ac- 



9 




live feels frustrated by being im- 
prisoned. But it’s simpler to call it 
senility . since God and my doc- 
tor know that my body is senile.” 

“I call it stinking bad temper, 
Johann, not senility — since you 
can control it when you want to. 
Don’t use it on me; I won’t stand 
for it.” 

Smith chuckled. “Never, Jake; 
I need you. Even more than I need 
Eunice — though she’s ever so much 
prettier than you. How about it, 
Eunice? Has my behavior been bad 
lately?” 

His secretary shrugged — pro- 
ducing complex secondary mo- 
tions pleasant to see. “You’re pret- 
ty stinky at times. Boss. But I’ve 
learned to ignore it.” 

“You see, Jake? If Eunice re- 
fused to put up with it — as you do 
— I’d be the sweetest boss in the 
land. As it is, I use her as a safety 
valve.” 

Salomon said, “Eunice, any 
time you get fed up with this vile- 
tempered old wreck you can work 
for me, at the same salary or high- 
er.” 

“Eunice, your salary just dou- 
bled!” 

“Thank you. Boss;” she said 
promptly. “I’ve recorded it. And 
the time. I’ll notify accounting.” 

Smith cackled. “See why I keep 
her? Don’t try to outbid me, you 
old goat. You don’t have enough 
chips.” 

“Senile,” Salomon growled. 
“Speaking of money, whom do 
you want to put into Parkinson’s 
slot?” 

“No rush, he was a blank file. 
Do ydu have a candidate, Jake?” 

“No. Although after this last 

10 



little charade it occurs to me that 
Eunice might be a good bet.” 
Eunice looked startled, then 
dropped all expression. Smith 
looked thoughtful. “It had not oc- 
curred to me. But it might be a 
perfect solution. Eunice, would 
you be willing to be a director of 
the senior corporation?” 

Eunice flipped her machine to 
“Not Recording.” “You’re both 
making fun of me! Stop it.” 

“My dear,” Smith said gently, 
“you know I don’t joke about 
money. As for Jake, it is the only 
subject sacred to him — he sold his 
daughter and his grandmother 
down to Rio.” 

“Not my daughter,” Salomon 
objected. “Just grandmother . 
and the old girl didn’t fetch much. 
But it gave us a spare bedroom.” 
“But, Boss, I don’t know any- 
thing about running a business!” 
“You wouldn’t have to. Direc- 
tors don’t manage, they set policy. 
But you do know more about run- 
ning it than most of our directors; 
you’ve been on the inside for 
years. Plus almost inside during 
the time you were my secretary’s 
secretary before Mrs. Bierman re- 
tired. But here are advantages I 
see in what may have been a play- 
ful suggestion on Jake’s part. You 
are already an officer of the cor- 
poration as Special Assistant Sec- 
retary assigned to record for the 
Board — and I made you that, 
you’ll both remember, to shut up 
Parkinson when he belly-ached 
about my secretary’s being present 
during an executive session. You’ll 
go on being that — and my personal 
secretary, too; can’t spare you — 
while becoming a director. No

conflict — you’ll simply vote as well 
as recording. Now we come to the 
key question: Are you willing to 
vote the way Jake votes?” 

She looked solemn. “You wish 
me to, sir?” 

“Or the way I do if I’m present, 
which comes to the same thing. 
Think back and you’ll see that 
Jake and I have always voted the 
same way on basic policy — settling 
it ahead of time — while wrangling 
and voting against each other on 
things that don’t matter. Read the 
old minutes, you’ll spot it.” 

“I noticed it long ago,” she said 
simply, “but didn’t think it was my 
place to comment.” 

“Jake, she’s our new director. 
One more point, my dear: If it 
turns out that we need your spot, 
will you resign? You won’t lose by 
it.” 

“Of course, sir. I don’t have to 
be paid to agree to that.” 

“You still won’t lose by it. I feel 
better. Eunice, I’ve had to turn 
management over to Teal; I’ll be 
turning policy over to Jake — you 
know the shape I’m in. I want Jake 
to have as many sure votes back- 
ing him as possible. Oh, we can 
always fire directors . but it is 
best not to have to do so, a fact 
von Ritter rubbed my nose in. 
Okay, you’re a director. We’ll for- 
malize it at that stockholders 
meeting. Welcome to the ranks of 
the Establishment. Instead of a 
wage slave, you have sold out and 
are now a counter-revolutionary, 
warmongering, rat-fink, fascist 
dog. How does it feel?” 

N ot ‘dog,’ ” Eunice objected. 
“The rest is lovely but dog is

the wrong sex. I’m female. A 
bitch.” 

“Eunice, I not only do not use 
such words with ladies around, 
you know that I do not care to 
hear them from ladies.” 

“Can a rat-fink fascist be a 
lady? Boss, I learned that word in 
kindergarten. Nobody minds it 
today.” 

“I learned it out behind the barn 
and let’s keep it there.” 

Salomon growled, “I don’t have 
time to listen to amateur lexicolo- 
gists. Is the conference over?” 
“What? Not at all! Now comes 
the top-secret part, the reason I 
sent the nurse out. So gather ye 
round.” 

“Johann, before you talk se- 
crets; let me ask one question. 
Does that bed have a mike on it? 
Your chair may be bugged, too.” 
“Eh?” The old man looked 
thoughtful. “I used a call button 
. until they started standing a 
heel-and-toe watch on me.” 

“Seven to two you’re bugged. 
Eunice my dear, can you trace the 
circuits and make sure?” 

“Uh . I doubt it. The cir- 
cuitry isn’t much like my steno- 
desk. But I’ll look.” Eunice left 
her desk, studied the console on 
the back of the wheel-chair. “These 
two dials almost certainly have 
mikes hooked to them; they’re 
respiration and heart beat. But 
they don’t show voices — my voice 
does not make the needles jiggle. 
Filtered out, I suppose. But — ” 
she looked thoughtful — “voice 
could be pulled off either circuit 
ahead of a filter. I do something 
like that, in reverse, whenever I re- 
cord with a high' background db. I 

n 




don’t know what these other dials 
do. Darn it, I might spot a voice 
circuit . but I could never be 
sure that there was not one. Or 
two. Or three. I’m sorry.” 

“Don’t be sorry, dear,” the law- 
yer said soothingly. “There hasn’t 
been real privacy in this country 
since the middle of the twentieth 
century — why, I could phone a 
man I know of and have you pho- 
tographed in your bath and you 
would never know it.” 

“Really? What a dreadful idea. 
How much does this person charge 
for such a job?” 

“Plenty. Depends on difficulty 
and how much chance he runs of 
being prosecuted. Never less than 
a couple of thousand and then up 
like a kite. But he can do it.” 

“Well!” Eunice looked thought- 
ful, then smiled. “Mr. Salomon, 
if you ever decide that you must 
have a picture of me, phone me for 
a competitive bid. My husband has 
an excellent Chinese camera and 1 
would rather have him photograph 
me in my bath than some strang- 
er.” 

“Order, please,” Smith said 
mildly. “Eunice, if you want to sell 
skin pictures to that old lecher, do 
it on your own time. I don’t know 
anything about these gadgets but I 
know how to solve this. Eunice, go 
out to where they telemeter me — 
I think it’s next door in what used 
to be my upstairs lounge. You’ll 
find Miss Macintosh there. Hang 
around three minutes. I’ll wait two 
minutes, then I’ll call out: ‘Miss 
Macintosh! Is Mrs. Branca there?’ 
If you hear me, we’ll know she’s 
snooping. If you don’t, come back 
at the end of three minutes.” 

12 



“Yes, sir. Do I give Miss Mac- 
intosh any reason for this?” 

“Give the old battle-axe any 
stall you like. I simply want to 
know if she is eavesdropping.” 
“Yes, sir.” Eunice started to 
leave the room. She pressed the 
door switch just as its buzzer 
sounded. The door snapped aside, 
revealing Miss Macintosh, who 
jumped in surprise. 

The nurse recovered and said 
bleakly to Mr. Smith, “May I 
come in for a moment?” 
“Certainly.” 

“Thank you, sir.” The nurse 
went to the bed, pulled its screen 
aside, touched four switches on its 
console, replaced the screen. Then 
she planted herself in front of her 
patient and said, “Now you have 
complete privacy, so far as my 
equipment is concerned. Sir.” 
“Thank you.” 

“I am not supposed to cut the 
voice monitors except on doctor’s 
orders. But you had privacy any- 
how. I am as bound to respect a 
patient’s privacy as a doctor is. I 
never listen to sickroom conver- 
sation. I don’t even hear it! Sir.” 
“Get your feathers down. If you 
weren’t listening, how did you 
know we were discussing the mat- 
ter?” 

“Oh! Because my name was 
mentioned. Hearing my name trig- 
gers me to listen. It’s a conditioned 
reflex. Though I don’t suppose you 
believe me.” 

“On the contrary, I do. Nurse — 
please switch on whatever you 
switehed off. Then bear in mind 
that I must talk privately and I’ll 
remember not to mention your 
name. But I’m glad to know that 

GALAXY 




I can reach you so promptly. To 
a man in my condition that is a 
comfort.” 

“Uh — very well, sir.” 

“And I want to thank you for 
putting up with my quirks. And 
bad temper.” 

She almost smiled. “Oh, you’re 
not so difficult, sir. I once put in 
two years in an N.P. hospital.” 

Smith looked startled, then 
grinned. “Touchel Was that where 
you acquired your hatred for bed- 
pans?” 

“It was indeed. Now if you will 
excuse me, sir — ” 

When she was gone, Salomon 
said, “You really think she won’t 
listen?” 

“Of course she will, she can’t 
help it, she’s already triggered and 
will be trying too hard not to lis- 
ten. But she’s proud, Jake, and I 
would rather depend on pride than 
gadgetry. Okay, I’m getting tired, 
so here it is in a lump. I want to 
buy a body. A young one.” 

E unice BRANCA barely 
showed reaction. Jake Salo- 
mon’s features dropped into the 
mask he used for poker and dis- 
trict attorneys. Presently Eunice 
said, “Am I to record, sir?” 

“No. Oh, hell, yes. Tell that sew- 
ing machine to make one copy for 
each of us and wipe the tape. 
File mine in my destruct file; file 
yours in your destruct file — and, 
Jake, hide your copy in the file you 
use to outwit the Infernal Revenue 
Service.” 

“I’ll file it in the still safer place 
I use for guilty clients. Johann, 
anything you say to me is privi- 
leged but I am bound to point out

IT IS June and science fiction is pro- 
liferating away at the Milford Work- 
shop and in other enlightened courses 
and areas all around the country. 
Summertime in hardcover publish- 
ing, traditionally a lazy, easy time, is 
a period of frenzied activity for pa- 
perbounders. The catalog for Fall 
was all done by the end ot May. Now 
comes the time when the books which 
were a gleam in someone's eye a 
month ago have to be translated into 
a reality— or the catalog becomes a 
wicked lie. This year is particularly 
frenzied because of the high immedi- 
acy quotient in many of th'^ environ- 
mental books we are doing. It is with 
a sigh of relief that one can turn to 
something staid, steady and reliable, 
like s.f.

RIGHT ON. Okay, its Clark Ashton 
Smith this month, in a volume titled 
ZOTHIQUE— he of the prose of deca- 
dent iridescence, just to prove that 
not all Adult Fantasy is fun and 
fairies ... It's rich stuff, vivid and 
powerful, with a great cover by 
George Barr. And this month it's 
DAY MILLION, by Frederik Pohl — 
a varied group of the master's later 
short stories to celebrate the reissue 
of three earlier collections, also avail- 
able this month— THE CASE 
AGAINST TOMORROW (aha!), THE 
MAN WHO ATE THE WORLD (how 
prophetic can you get?) and DIGITS 
AND DASTARDS (the answers are 
all in the numbers, right?). And this 
month, a newcomer to the fold— R.W. 
Mackelworth. His first novel, a 
strangely haunting tale of the rem- 
nants of life surviving in a world of 
deathly cold, living on dreams of "the 
warm." Remember that theory about 
the polar icecaps and a pull on the 
Earth's floating crust? Or alterna- 
tively a shift in the axis? It could lead 
to a lot of excitemenf— and does, in 
TILTANGLE.

MEANWHILE, back at the plant, the 
motto for the month is GARBAGE IS 
GOLD. No pun intended. We'll almost 
certainly be doing a book about gar- 
bage— but that's a goodie to come.

that the Canons forbid me to ad- 
vise a client in how to break the 
law, or to permit a client to dis- 
cuss such intention. As for Eunice, 
anything you say to her or in her 
presence is not privileged.” 

“Oh, come off it, you old shy- 
ster; you’ve advised me in how to 
break the law twice a week for 
years. As for Eunice, nobody can 
get anything out of her short of 
all-out brainwash.” 

“I didn’t say I always followed 
the Canons; I merely told you what 
they called for. I won’t deny that 
my professional ethics have a little 
stretch in them — but I won’t be 
party to anything smelling of body- 
snatching, kidnapping, or congress 
with slavery. Any self-respecting 
prostitute — meaning me — has lim- 
its.” 

“Spare me the sermon, Jake; 
what I want is both moral and 
ethical. I need your help to see 
that all of it is legal — utterly legal, 
can’t cut corners on this — and 
practical.” 

“I hope so.” 

“I know so. I said I wanted to 
buy a body — legally. That rules 
out bodysnatching, kidnapping, 
and slavery. I want to make a le- 
gal purchase.” 

"You can’t.” 

“Why not? Take this body,” 
Smith said, pointing to his chest. 
“It’s not worth much even as ma- 
nure; nevertheless I can will it to a 
medical school. You know I can. 
You okayed it.” 

“Oh. Let’s get our terms straight. 
In the United States there can be 
no chattel ownership of a human 
being. Thirteenth Amendment. 
Therefore your body is not your 

GALAXY 




property because you can’t sell it. 
But a cadaver is property — usually 
of the estate of the deceased . 
although a cadaver is not often 
treated the way other chattels are 
treated. But it is indeed property. 
If you want to buy a cadaver, it 
can be arranged — but whom were 
you calling a ghoul earlier?” 

“What is a cadaver, Jake?” 

“Eh? A dead body, usually of a 
human. So says Webster. The le- 
gal definition is more complicated 
but comes to the same thing.” 

“It’s that ‘more complicated’ 
aspect I’m getting at. Okay, once 
it is dead, it is property and maybe 
we can buy it. But what is ‘death,’ 
Jake, and when does it take place? 
Never mind Webster; what is the 
/an/?” 

“Oh. Law is what the Supreme 
Court says it is. Fortunately this 
point was nailed down in the ’sev- 
enties — Estate of Henry M. Par- 
sons vs. Rhode Island. For years, 
many centuries, a man was dead 
when his heart quit beating. Then, 
for about a century, he was dead 
when a licensed M.D. examined 
him for heart action and respira- 
tion and certified that he was dead 
— and sometimes that turned out 
grisly, as doctors do make mis- 
takes. And then along came the 
first heart transplant and oh, moth- 
er, what a legal snarl that stirred 
up! 

“But the Parsons case settled it 
— a man is dead when all brain ac- 
tivity has stopped, permanently.” 
“And what does that mean?” 
Smith persisted. 

“The court declined to define 
it. But in application — look, Jo- 
hann, I’m a corporation lawyer, 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



not a specialist in medical juris- 
prudence nor in forensic medicine 
— and I would have to research 
before I—” 

“Okay, so you’re not God. You 
can revise your remarks later. 
What do you know now?” 

“When the exact moment of 
death is important, as it sometimes 
is in estate cases, as it often is in 
accident, manslaughter and mur- 
der cases, as it always is in an or- 
gan transplant case, some doctor 
determines that the brain has quit 
and isn’t going to start up again. 
They use various tests and talk 
about ‘irreversible coma’ and ‘com- 
plete absence of brain wave activ- 
ity’ and ‘cortical damage beyond 
possibility of repair — ’ but it all 
comes down to some M.D. laying 
his reputation and license on the 
line to certify that this brain is 
dead and won’t come alive again. 
Heart and lungs are now irrelevant. 
They are classed with hands and 
feet and gonads and other parts 
that a man can do without or have 
replaced. It’s the brain that counts. 
Plus a doctor’s opinion about that 
brain. In transplant cases there are 
almost always at least two doctors 
in no way connected with the oper- 
ation and probably a coroner as 
well. Not because the Supreme 
Court requires it — in fact only a 
few of the fifty-four states have 
legislated in re thanatotic require- 
ments — but — ” 

“Just a moment, Mr. Salomon 
— that odd word. My typewriter 
has placed a query after it.” Eunice 
kept her hand over the “Hold” 
light. 

“How did your typer spell it?” 

“T-H-A-N-A-T-O-T-I-C.” 



15 




“Smart machine. It’s the techni- 
cal adjective referring to death. 
From the Greek god Thanatos, 
Death.” 

“Half a second while I tell it so.” 
Eunice touched the “Memory” 
switch with her other hand, whis- 
pered briefly, then said, “It feels 
better if 1 reassure it at once. Go 
ahead.” She lifted her hand from 
the “Hold” light. 

“Eunice, are you under the im- 
pression that that machine is alive?” 

S HE blushed, then touched 
“Erase” and covered “Hold.” 
“No, Mr. Salomon. But it does 
behave better with me than with 
any other operator. It can get 
downright sulky if it doesn’t like 
the way it is handled.” 

“I can testify to that,” Smith 
agreed. “If Eunice takes a day off, 
her relief had better fetch her own 
gadgets or fall back on shorthand. 
Listen, dear, knock off the chatter. 
Talk with Jake about the care and 
feeding of machines some other 
time; great-grandfather wants to 
go to bed.” 

“Yes, sir.” She lifted her hand. 
“Johann, I was saying that in 
transplant cases the medical pro- 
fession has set up tight rules or 
customs, both to protect them- 
selves from criminal and civil ac- 
tions and also, I am sure, to fore- 
stall restrictive legislation. They 
have to get that heart out while it’s 
still alive and nevertheless protect 
themselves from indictments for 
murder, cum multimillion-dollar 
damage suits. So they spread the 
responsibility thin and back each 
other up.” 

“Yes,” agreed Smith. “Jake, 



you haven’t told me a thing I 
didn’t know — but you have re- 
lieved my mind by confirming facts 
and law. Now I know it can be 
done. Okay, I want a healthy body 
between ages twenty and forty, still 
warm, heart still working and no 
other damage too difficult to re- 
pair . but with the brain legally 
dead, dead, dead. I want to buy 
that cadaver and have this brain 
— mine — transplanted into it.” 
Eunice held perfectly still. Jake 
blinked. “When do you want this 
body? Later today?” 

“Oh, next Wednesday ought to 
be soon enough. Garcia says he 
can keep me going.” 

“I suggest later today. And get 
you a new brain at the same time — 
that one has quit functioning.” 
“Knock it off, Jake; I’m seri- 
ous. My body is falling to pieces. 
But my mind is clear and my mem- 
ory isn’t bad — ask me yesterday’s 
closing prices on every stock we 
are interested in. I can still do log- 
arithmic calculations without ta- 
bles; I check myself every day. 
Because I know how far gone I am. 
Look at me — worth so many mega- 
bucks that it’s silly to count them. 
But with a body held together with 
Scotch tape and string — I ought to 
be in a museum. 

“Now, all my life I’ve heard 
‘You can’t take it with you.’ Well, 
eight months ago when they tied 
me down with all this undignified 
plumbing and wiring, having noth- 
ing better to do I started thinking 
about that old saw. I decided that, 
if I couldn’t take it with me, I 
wasn’t going to go!” 

“Humph! ‘You’ll go when the 
wagon comes.’ ” 



16 



GALAXY 




“Perhaps. But I’m going to 
spend as much as necessary of that 
silly stack of dollars to try to beat 
the game. Will you help?” 

“Johann, if you were talking 
about a routine heart transplant, 
I would say Good luck and God 
bless you! But a brain transplant 
— have you any idea what that en- 
tails?” 

“No, and neither do you. But I 
know more about it than you do — 
I’ve had endless time to read up. 
No need to tell me that no suc- 
cessful transplant of a human brain 
has ever been made; I know it. No 
need to tell me that the Chinese 
have tried it several times and 
failed — although they have three 
basket cases still alive if my infor- 
mants are correct.” 

“Do you want to be a basket 
case?” 

“No. But there are two chimpan- 
zees climbing trees and eating ba- 
nanas this very day — and each has 
the brain the other one started 
with.” 

“Oho! That Australian.” 

“Dr. Lindsay Boyle. He’s the 
surgeon I must have.” 

“Boyle. There was a scandal, 
wasn’t there? They ran him out of 
Australia.” 

“So they did, Jake. Ever hear of 
professional jealousy? Most neu- 
rosurgeons are wedded to the no- 
tion that a brain transplant is too 
complicated. But if you dig into it 
you will find the same opinions ex- 
pressed fifty years ago about 
heart transplants. If you ask neu- 
rosurgeons about those chimpan- 
zees, the kindest thing any of them 
will say is that it’s a fake — even 
though there are motion pictures 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



of both operations. Or they talk 
about the many failures Boyle 
had before he learned how. Jake, 
they hate him so much they ran 
him out of his home country when 
he was about to try it on a hu- 
man being. Why, those bastards 
— excuse me, Eunice.” 

“My machine is instructed to 
spell that word as ‘scoundrel’.” 
“Thank you, Eunice.” 

“Where is he now, Johann?” 

“In Buenos Aires.” 

“Can you travel that far?” 

“Oh, no! Well, perhaps I could, 
in a plane big enough for these 
mechanical monstrosities they use 
to keep me alive. But first we need 
that body. And the best possible 
medical center for computer-as- 
sisted surgery. And a support 
team of surgeons. And all the rest. 
Say Johns Hopkins. Or Stanford 
Medical Center.” 

“I venture to say that neither one 
will permit this unfrocked surgeon 
to operate.” 

“Jake, Jake, of course they will. 
Don’t you know how to bribe a 
university?” 

“I’ve never tried it.” 

Y OU do it with really big chunks 
of money, openly, with an aca- 
demic procession to give it dig- 
nity. But first you find out what 
they want — football stands, or a 
particle accelerator, or an endowed 
chair. But the key is plenty of mon- 
ey. From my point of view it is bet- 
ter to be alive and young again, 
and broke, than it is to be the rich- 
est corpse in Forest Lawn.” Smith 
smiled. “It would be exhilarating 
to be young— and broke. So don’t 
spare the shekels. 



17 




“I know you can set it up for 
Boyle; it’s just a question of whom 
to bribe and how — in the words of 
Bill Gresham, a man I knew a long 
time ago: ‘Find out what he wants — 
he’ll geek!’ 

“But the toughest problem in- 
volves no bribery but simply a 
willingness to spend money. Lo- 
cating that warm body. Jake, in 
this country over ninety thousand 
people per year are killed in traf- 
fic accidents alone — call it two 
hundred and fifty each day — and a 
lot of those victims die of skull 
injuries. A fair percentage are be- 
tween twenty and forty years old 
and in good health aside from a 
broken skull and a ruined brain. 
The problem is to find one while 
the body is still alive, then keep it 
alive and rush it to surgery.” 

“With wives and relatives and 
cops and lawyers chasing along be- 
hind.” 

“Certainly. If money and organ- 
ization weren’t used beforehand. 
Finders’ fees — call them something 
else. Life-support teams and cop- 
ters equipped for them always 
standing by, near the worst con- 
centrations of dangerous traffic. 
Contributions to highway patrol 
relief funds, thousands of release 
forms ready to sign, lavish pay- 
ment to the estate of the deceased 
— oh, at least a million dollars. 
Oh, yes, nearly forgot — I’ve got an 
odd blood type and any transplant 
is more likely to take if they don’t 
have to fiddle with swapping blood. 
There are only about a million peo- 
ple in this country with blood 
matching mine. Not an impossi- 
ble number when you cut it down 
still further by age span — twenty 

18 



to forty — and good health. Call 
it three hundred thousand, tops. 
Jake, if we ran big newspaper ads 
and bought prime time on video, 
how many people could we flush 
out of the bushes? If we dangled a 
million dollars as bait? One mega- 
buck in escrow with Chase Man- 
hattan Bank for the estate of the 
accident victim whose body is 
used? With a retainer to any pros- 
pective donor and his spouse who 
will sign up in advance.” 

“Johann, I’m durned if I know. 
But I would hate to be married to 
a woman who could collect a mil- 
lion dollars by ‘accidentally’ hit- 
ting me in the head with a ham- 
mer. 

“Details, Jake. Write it so that 
no one can murder and benefit by 
it — and suicide must be excluded, 
too; I don’t want blood on my 
hands. The real problem is to lo- 
cate healthy young people who 
have my blood type, and feed their 
names and addresses into a com- 
puter.” 

“Excuse me, Mr. Smith, but 
have you thought of consulting the 
Rare Blood Club?” 

“Be darned! I am growing se- 
nile. No, I hadn’t, Eunice — and 
how do you happen to know about 
it?” 

“I’m a member, sir.” 

“Then you’re a donor, dear?” 
Smith sounded pleased and im- 
pressed. 

“Yes, sir. Type AB-Negative.” 

“Be darned twice. Used to be a 
donor myself — until they told me I 
was too old, long before you were 
born. And your type — AB-Neg- 
ative.” 

“I thought you must be, sir, 
GALAXY 




when you mentioned the number. 
So small. Only about a third of 
one percent of us in the popula- 
tion. My husband is AB-Negative, 
too, and a donor. You see — well, 
I met Joe early one morning when 
we were both called to give blood 
to a new-born and its mother.” 
“Well, hooray for Joe Branca! 
I knew he was smart — he grabbed 
you, didn’t he? I had not known 
that he was an Angel of Mercy 
as well. Tell you what, dear — when 
you get home tonight, tell Joe that 
all he has to do is to dive into a 
dry swimming pool . and you’ll 
be not only the prettiest widow in 
town — but the richest.” 

“Boss, you have a nasty .sense 
of humor. I wouldn’t swap Joe for 
any million dollars — money won’t 
keep you warm on a cold night.” 
“As I know to my sorrow, dear. 
Jake, can my will be broken?” 

“Any will can be broken. But 1 
don’t think yours will be. I tried to 
build fail-safes into it.” 

“Suppose I make a new will 
along the same general lines but 
with some changes — would it stand 
up?” 

“No.” 

“Why not?” 

Y OU said it yourself. Senility. 

Any time a rich man dies at an 
advanced age with a new will any- 
one with an interest in breaking it 
— your granddaughters, I mean — 
will try to break it, alleging senility 
and undue influence. I think they 
would succeed.” 

“Darn. I want to put Eunice 
down for a million so she won’t 
be tempted to kill her AB-Nega- 
tive husband.” 



“Boss, you’re making fun of me 
again. Nasty fun.” 

“Eunice. I told you that I do not 
joke about money. How do we 
handle it, Jake? Since I’m too se- 
nile to make a will.” 

“Well, the simplest way would 
be an insurance policy with a paid- 
up single premium . which would 
cost, in view of your age and 
health, slightly more than a mil- 
lion, I surmise. But she would get 
it even if your will was broken.” 
“Mr. Salomon, don’t listen — ” 
“Johann, do you want that mil- 
lion to revert to you if by any long 
chance you outlive Eunice?” 

“Mmm ... no, if it did, a judge 
might decide to look at the mat- 
ter — and God himself doesn’t 
know what a judge will do these 
days. Make the Red Cross the re- 
siduary. No, make it the Rare 
Blood Club.” 

“Very well.” 

“Get it paid up first thing in the 
morning. No, do it tonight; I may 
not live till morning. Get an un- 
derwriter — Jack Towers, maybe — 
get Jefferson Billings to open that 
pawnshop of his and get a certified 
check. Use my power of attorney, 
not your own money, or you might 
be stuck for it. Get the signature of 
a responsible officer of the insur- 
ance company, then you can go to 
bed.” 

“Yes, Great Spirit. I’ll vary that; 
I’m a better lawyer than you are. 
But the policy will be in force be- 
fore night — with your money, not 
mine. Eunice, be careful not to kick 
those hoses and wires as you go 
out. But tomorrow you needn’t be 
careful — as long as you don’t 
get caught.”

She sniffed. “You each have a 
nasty sense of humor. Boss, I’m 
going to erase this. I don’t want a 
million dollars. Not from Joe dy- 
ing, not from you dying.” 

“If you don’t want it, Eunice,” 
her employer said gently, “you 
can step aside and let the Rare 
Blood Club have it.” 

“Uh . Mr. Salomon, is that 
correct?” 

“Yes, Eunice. But money is nice 
to have, especially when you don’t 
have it. Your husband might be 
annoyed if you turned down a 
million dollars.” 

“Uh — ” Mrs. Branca shut up. 
“Take care of it, Jake. While 
thinking about how to buy a warm 
body. And how to get Boyle here 
and get him whatever permission 
he needs to do surgery in this 
country. And so forth. And tell — 
no. I’ll tell her. Miss Macintosh!” 
“Yes, Mr. Smith?” came a voice 
from the bed console. 

“Get your team in; I want to go 
to bed.” 

“Yes, sir. I’ll tell Dr. Garcia.” 
Jake stood up. “Good day, Jo- 
hann. You’re a crazy fool.” 
“Probably. But I do have fun 
with my money.” 

“So you do. Eunice, may I run 
you home?” 

“Oh, no, sir, thank you. My 
Gadabout is in the basement.” 
“Eunice,” said her boss, “can’t 
you see that the old goat wants to 
take you home? So be gracious. 
One of my guards will take your 
Gadabout home.” 

“Uh . thank you, Mr. Salo- 
mon. I accept. Get a good night’s 
sleep. Boss.” They started to 
leave. 

20 



“Wait, Eunice,” Smith com- 
manded. “Hold that pose. Jake, 
pipe those gams! Eunice, that’s ob- 
solete slang meaning that you have 
pretty legs.” 

“So you have told me before, 
sir — and so my husband often tells 
me. Boss, you’re a dirty old man.” 
He cackled. “So I am, my dear 
. and have been since I was six. 
I’m happy to say.” 



M r. SALOMON helped her in- 
to her cloak, rode down with 
her to the basement, waved his 
uards aside and handed her into 
is car. Shotgun locked them in, 
got in by driver-guard and locked 
that compartment. As she sat down 
Mrs. Branca said, “Oh, how big\ 
Mr. Salomon, I knew a Rolls was 
roomy — but I’ve never been in one 
before.” 

“A Rolls only by courtesy, my 
dear — body by Skoda, power plant 
by Imperial Atomics, then Rolls- 
Royce pretties it and backs it with 
their reputation and service. You 
should have seen a Rolls fifty 
years ago, before gasoline engines 
were outlawed. There was a dream 
car!” 

“This one is dreamy enough. 
Why, my little Gadabout would 
fit inside this compartment.” 

A voice from the ceiling said, 
“Orders, sir?” 

Mr. Salomon touched a switch. 
“One moment, Rockford.” He 
lifted his hand. “Where do you live, 
Eunice? Or the coordinates of 
wherever you want to go?” 

“Oh. I’ll go home. North one 
one eight, west thirty-seven, then 
up to level nineteen — though I 

GALAXY 




doubt that this enormous car will 
fit into the vehicle lift.” 

“If not, Rocky and his partner 
will escort you up the passenger 
lift and to your door.” 

“That’s nice. Joe doesn’t want 
me to ride passenger lifts by my- 
self.” 

“Joe is right. So we’ll deliver you 
like a courier letter. Eunice, are 
you in a hurry?” 

“Me? Joe expects me when I 
get there, Mr. Smith’s working 
hours being so irregular now. To- 
day I’m quite early.” 

“Good.” Mr. Salomon again 
touched the intercom switch. 
“Rockford, we’re going to kill 
some time. Uh, Mrs. Branca, what 
zone for those coordinates? 
Eighteen something?” 

“Nineteen-B, sir.” 

“Find a cruising circle near nine- 
teen-B; I’ll give you coordinates 
later.” 

“Very good, sir.” 

Salomon went on to Eunice. 
“This compartment is soundproof 
unless I thumb this switch; they 
can’t hear us. Which is good as I 
want to discuss things with you and 
make phone calls about that in- 
surance policy.” 

“Oh? Surely that was a joke.” 
“Joke, eh? Mrs. Branca, I have 
been working for Johann Smith for 
twenty-six years, the last fifteen 
with his affairs as my sole prac- 
tice. Today he made me de facto 
chairman of his industrial empire. 
Yet if I failed to carry out his or- 
ders about that insurance policy — 
tomorrow I would be out of a job.” 
“Oh, surely not! He depends on 
you.” 

“He depends on me as long as 
I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



he can depend on me and not one 
minute longer. That policy must be 
written tonight. I thought you had 
quit fretting when you learned that 
you could step aside for the Rare 
Blood Club?” 

“Well, yes. Except that I’m 
afraid I might get greedy and take 
it. When the time comes.” 

“And why not? The Rare Blood 
Club has done nothing for him; 
you have done much.” 

“I’m well paid.” 

“Listen, you silly child, don’t be 
a silly child. He wanted you to 
have a million dollars in his will. 
And he wanted you to know it so 
that he could enjoy seeing your 
face. I pointed out that it is too 
late to change his will. Even this 
insurance gimmick is chancy if his 
natural heirs get a look at the 
books and discover it — which I 
shall try to prevent — as a judge 
might decide it was just a dodge — 
as it is — and require the insurance 
company to pay it to his estate. 
Which is where the Rare Blood 
Club comes in handy; they would 
probably fight it and win, if you 
cut them in for half. 

“But there are other ways. Sup- 
pose you knew nothing about this 
and were invited to the reading of 
his will and discovered that your 
deceased employer had bequeathed 
you a lifetime income ‘in grateful 
appreciation of long and faithful 
service.’ Would you turn it down?” 
“Uh — ” she said, and stopped. 

“ ‘Uh,’ ” he repeated. “Exactly, 
‘Uh.’ Of course you wouldn’t turn 
it down. He’d be gone and you’d 
be out of a job and there would be 
no reason to refuse it. So, instead 
of a lump sum so big it embar- 

21 




rasses you, I’m going to write a 
policy that sets up a trust to pay 
you an annuity.” He paused to 
think. “A safe return, after taxes, 
on a trust is about four percent. 
What would you say to around 
seven hundred and fifty a week? 
Would that upset you?” 

“Well ... no. I understand sev- 
en hundred and fifty dollars' much 
better than I understand a mil- 
lion.” 

“The beauty of it is that we 
can use the principal to insure 
against inflation — and you can still 
leave that million, or more, to the 
Rare Blood Club when your own 
Black Camel kneels.” 

“Really? How wonderful! I nev- 
er will understand high finance.” 

“That’s because most people 
think of money as something to 
pay the rent. But a money man 
thinks of money in terms of what 
he can do with it. Never mind. I’ll 
fix it so that all you need do is 
spend it. I’ll use a Canadian insur- 
ance company and a Canadian 
bank, as each will be stuffy about 
letting a U.S. Court look at its 
records. In case his granddaugh- 
ters find out what I’ve done, I 
mean.” 

“Oh. Mr. Salomon, shouldn’t 
this money go to them?” 

“Again, don’t be silly. They are 
harpies. Snapping turtles. And had 
nothing to do with making this 
money. Do you know anything 
about Johann’s family? Outlived 
three wives — and his fourth mar- 
ried him for his money and it cost 
him millions to get shut of her. 
His first wife gave him a son and 
died in doing so — then Johann’s 
son was killed trying to capture a 

22 



worthless hill. Two more wives, 
two divorces, a daughter by each 
of those two wives, resulting in a 
total of four granddaughters — and 
those ex-wives and their daughters 
are all dead, and their four carniv- 
orous descendants have been wait- 
ing for Johann to die and are sore 
at him because he hasn’t.” 

Salomon grinned. “They’re in 
for a shock. I wrote his will so as 
to give them small lifetime in- 
comes — and chop them off with a 
nominal dollar if they contest. 
Now excuse me. I must make 
phone calls, then take you home 
and run over to Canada and nail 
this down.” 

“Yes, sir. Do you mind if I take 
off my cloak? It’s rather warm.” 
“Want the cooling turned up?” 
“Only if you are too warm. But 
this cloak is heavier than it looks.” 
“I noticed it was heavy. Body 
armor?” 

“Yes. sir. I’m out by myself 
quite a lot.” 

“No wonder you’re too warm. 
Take it off. Take off anything you 
wish to.” 

She grinned at him. “I wonder if 
you are a dirty old man, too. For 
another million?” 

“Not a durned dime! Shut up, 
child, and let me phone.” 

“Yes, sir.” Mrs. Branca wig- 
gled out of her cloak, then raised 
the leg rest on her side, stretched 
out, and relaxed. 

S UCH a strange day ... am I 
really going to be rich? Doesn’t 
seem real . well. I’m not going

it — unless it’s safe in the bank .

we were married . some men 
understand money — such as Mr. 
Salomon, or Boss — and some 
don’t, such as Joe . but as sweet 
a husband as a girl could wish . 
as long as I never again let him 
share a joint account . 

Dear Joe! Those are pretty 
gams if you do say so as shouldn’t, 
you bitch. ‘Bitch — ’ how quaint 
Boss is with his old-fashioned ta- 
boos . always necessary not to 
shock him — not too much, that is; 
Boss enjoys a slight flavor of 
shock, like a whiff of garlic . 
especially necessary not to annoy 
him with language everybody uses 
nowadays ... Joe is good for a 
girl, never have to be careful 
around him . except about mon- 
ey .. 

Wonder what Joe would think if 
he could see me locked in this lux- 
urious vault with this old goat . 
probably be amused but best not 
to tell him, dearie; men’s minds 
don’t work the way ours do, men 
are not logical . wrong to think 
of Mr. Salomon as an ‘old goat’ 
though; he certainly has not acted 
like one . you had to reach for 
that provocative remark, didn’t 
you, dear? Just to see what he 
would say . and found out! Got 
squelched — 

Is he too old? Hell, no, dear, 
the way they hike ’em up with 
hormones a man is never too old 
until he’s too feeble to move . 
the way Boss is . not that Boss 
ever made the faintest pass even 
years back when he was still in fair 
shape . 

Does Boss really expect to re- 
gain his youth by transplanting his 
brain? Arms and legs and kidneys 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



and even hearts, sure, sure — but a 
brain? 

S ALOMON switched off the 
telephone. “Done,” he an- 
nounce. “All but signing papers 
which I’ll do in Toronto this eve- 
ning.” 

“I’m sorry to be so much trou- 
ble, sir.” 

“My pleasure.” 

“I do appreciate it. And I must 
think about how to thank Boss — 
didn’t thank him today but didn’t 
think he meant it.” 

“Don’t thank him.” 

“Oh, but I must. But I don’t 
know how. How does one thank a 
man for a million dollars? And not 
seem insincere?” 

“Hmm! There are ways. But, in 
this case, don’t. My dear, you de- 
lighted Johann when you showed 
no trace of gratitude; I know him. 
Too many people have thanked 
him in the past . then figured 
him as an easy mark and tried to 
bleed him again. Then tried to 
knife him when he turned out not 
to be. So don’t thank him. Sweet 
talk he does not believe; he figures 
it’s always aimed at his money. I 
notice you’re spunky with him.” 

“I have to be, sir, or he tromps 
on me. He had me in tears a cou- 
ple of times — years back — before 
I found out he wanted me to stand 
up to him.” 

“You see? The old tyrant 'is 
making bets with himself as to 
whether you’ll come trotting in to- 
morrow and lick his hand like a 
dog. So don’t even mention it. Tell 
me about yourself, Eunice — age, 
how long you’ve been married and 
how often, number of children, 

23 




childhood diseases, why you aren’t 
on video, what your husband does, 
how you got to be Johann’s secre- 
tary, number of arrests and for 
what — or tell me to go to hell; you 
are entitled to privacy. But I would 
like to know you better; we are go- 
ing to be working together from 
here on.” 

“I don’t mind answering.” (I’ll 
tell just what I want to tell!) “But 
does this work both ways?” She 
stopped to let down the leg rest, 
straightened up. “Do I quiz you 
the same way?” 

He chuckled. “Certainly. I may 
take the Fifth. Or lie.” 

“I could lie, too, sir. But I don’t 
need to. I’m twenty-eight and mar- 
ried once and still am. No chil- 
dren — no children yet; I’m licensed 
for three. As for my job — well, I 
won a beauty contest at eighteen, 
the sort that offers a one-year con- 
tract making appearances around 
your home state, plus a video test 
with an option for a seven-year 
contract — ” 

“And they didn’t pick up your 
option. I’m astonished.” 

“Not that, sir. Instead I took 
stock of myself — and quit. Win- 
ning that state contest and then 
losing the national contest made 
me realize how many pretty girls 
there are. Too many. And some 
things I heard from them about 
what you have to go through to 
get into video and stay there . 
well, I didn’t want it that much. 
And went back to school and took 
an associate’s degree in secretarial 
electronics, with a minor in com- 
puter language and cybernetics, 
and went looking for a job.” (And 
I’m not going to tell you how I 

24 



got through school!) “And even- 
tually filled in as Mrs. Bierman’s 
secretary while her regular secre- 
tary had a baby . then she didn’t 
come back and I stayed on . and 
when Mrs. Bierman retired. Boss 
let me fill in. And kept me on. So 
here I am — a very lucky girl.” 

“A very smart girl. But I’m sure 
your looks had much to do with 
Johann’s decision to keep you on.” 
“I know they did,” she answered 
quietly. “But he would not have 
kept me had I not been able to do 
his work. I know how I look but 
I’m not conceited about it; appear- 
ance is a matter of heredity.” 

“So it is,” he agreed, “but there 
are impressive data to show that 
beautiful women are, on the aver- 
age, more intelligent than homely 
ones.” 

“Oh, I don’t think so! Take 
Mrs. Bierman — downright home- 
ly. But she was terribly smart.” 

“I said on the average,” he re- 
peated. “What is beauty? A lady 
hippopotamus must look beautiful 
to her boy friend, or we would run 
out of hippopotamuses — potami — 
in one generation. What we think 
of as physical beauty is almost, 
certainly a tag for a complex of 
useful survival characteristics. 
Smartness — intelligence — among 
them. Do you think that a male 
hippo would think you beautiful?” 
She giggled. “Not likely!” 

“You see? In reality you’re no 
prettier than a female hippopota- 
mus; you are simply an inherited 
complex of survival characteristics 
useful to your species.” 

“I suppose so.” (Humph! Give 
me one opening and I’ll show you 
what I am.)

“But since Johann — and I — are 
of your species, what that means 
to us is beauty. Which Johann ap- 
preciates.” 

I KNOW he does,” she said 
quietly,. She straightened her 
scarlet-covered leg in full exten- 
sion and looked at it. “I dress this 
way to amuse Boss. When I first 
went to work for Smith Enter- 
prises 1 wore as little as the other 
girls in the outer offices — you 
know, skin paint and not much 
else. Then, when I went to work 
for Mrs. Bierman, I started dress- 
ing quite modestly because she did 
— covered up all over, I mean, like 
Nurse Macintosh — not even a see- 
through. Uncomfortable. I went 
on dressing that way when Mrs. 
Bierman left. Until one morning I 
had only one such outfit — 1 wore 
disposables, cheaper than having 
them cleaned — and spilled coffee 
down the front and was caught 
with nothing to wear. 

“And no time to buy anything 
for I was more afraid of being late 
— you know how impatient Mr. 
Smith is — than I was that he might 
disapprove of my dress. Or lack of 
it. So I gritted my teeth and got 
out an office-girl bikini and asked 
Joe to paint me and hurry it up. 
Joe’s an artist, did I say?” 

“1 don’t believe so.” 

“He is. He does my skin paint- 
ing, even styles my face. But I was 
late anyhow that morning as Joe 
really is an artist and refused to let 
it go with just spraying me the 
background color. The two-piecee 
was white with asorted sizes of big 
blue polka dots . and Joe in- 
sisted on continuing the pattern

all over me, with me cussing and 
telling him to hurry and him in- 
sisting on painting just one more 
big polka dot. I was so late that I 
cut through an Abandoned Area I 
ordinarily circled around.” 

“Eunice, you should never go 
into an Abandoned Area. Good 
God, child, even the police don’t 
risk it other than in a car as well 
armored as this one. You could 
be mugged, raped and murdered 
and no one would ever know.” 

“Yes, sir. But I was scared of 
losing my job. I tried to explain to 
Boss why I was late and he told 
me to shut up and go to work. 
Nevertheless, he was unusually 
mellow that day. The next day I 
wore the sort of full cover-up I 
had been wearing — and he was 
downright mean all day. Mr. Salo- 
mon, I don’t have to be slapped in 
the face with a wet fish; from then 
on I quit trying to look like a nun 
and dressed and painted to enhance 
what I’ve got as effectively as pos- 
sible.” 

“It’s effective. But, dear, you 
should be more careful. It’s all 
very well to wear sexy clothes for 
Johann; that’s charity. The old 
wretch can’t get much pleasure out 
of life and is no threat to you, the 
shape he is in.” 

“He never was a threat, sir. In 
all the years I’ve worked for Mr. 
Smith he has never so much as 
touched my hand. He just makes 
flattering remarks about each new 
getup — sometimes quite salty and 
then I sass him and threaten to tell 
my husband, which makes him 
cackle. All innocent as Sunday 
school.”

J ASON QUEVEDO lives in 
Shanghai, though just barely: 
his apartment is on the 761st floor, 
and if he lived only one level lower 
he would be in Chicago, which is 
no place for a scholar. His wife 
Micaela frequently tells him that 
their lowly status in Shanghai is a 
direct reflection of the quality of 
his work. Micaela is the sort of 
wife who often says things like that. 

Jason spends most of his work- 
ing time down in Pittsburgh, where 



the archives are. He is a historian 
and needs to consult the docu- 
ments, the records of how it used 
to be. He does his research in a 
clammy little cubicle on the urb- 
mon’s 185th floor, almost in the 
middle of Pittsburgh. He does not 
really have to work down there, 
since anything in the archives can 
easily be piped up to the data ter- 
minal in his own apartment. But 
he feels it is a matter of profes- 
sional pride to have an office 
where he can file and arrange and 
handle the source materials. He 



26 




said as much when he was pulling person in an urban monad. When 
strings to have the office assigned more than 800,000 people live un- 
to him; “The task of recreating der the same roof, absolute social 
previous eras is a delicate and harmony is essential. He knows 
complex one, which must be per- that if he loses his temper and be- 
formed under optimal circum- haves in a seriously unblessworthy 
stances, or — ” way they simply throw him down 

The truth is that if he didn’t es- the chute and turn his mass into 
cape from Micaela and their five energy. So he is careful, 
littles every day, he’d go flippo. He is a short, soft-spoken man 
That is, accumulated frustration with mild green eyes and thinning 
and humiliation would cause him sandy hair. “Your meek exterior 
to commit nonsocial acts, perhaps is deceptive,” lovely Mamelon 
violent ones. He is aware that Kluver told him throatily at a par- 
there is no room for the nonsocial ty last summer. “Your type is like 



27 







a sleeping volcano. You explode 
suddenly, astonishingly, passion- 
ately.” He thinks she may be 
right. He fears the possibilities. 

He has been desperately in love 
with Mamelon Kluver for perhaps 
the last three years, and certainly 
since the night of that party. He 
has never dared to touch her. 
Mamelon’s husband is the cele- 
brated Siegmund Kluver, who 
though not yet fifteen is universal- 
ly recognized as one of the urb- 
mon’s future leaders. Jason is not 
afraid that Siegmund would ob- 
ject. In an urban monad, natural- 
ly, no man has a right to withhold 
his wife from anyone who desires 
her. Nor is Jason afraid of what 
Micaela would say. He knows his 
privileges. He is simply afraid of 
Mamelon. And perhaps of himself.

J ASON dictates such memoran- 
da whenever and wherever some 
new structural hypothesis enters 
his mind. These are thoughts that 
come to him during a nightwalk- 
ing excursion on the 155th floor, 
in Tokyo. He is with a thickset 
young brunette named Gretl when 
the sequence of ideas arrives. He 
has been fondling her for some 
minutes and she is panting, ready, 
her hips pumping, her eyes nar- 
rowed to steamy slits. 

“Excuse me,” he says and 
reaches across her heavy quivering 
breasts for a stylus. “I have to 
write something down.” He acti- 
vates the data terminal’s input 
screen and punches the button that 
will relay a printout of his memo- 
randum to his desk at his research 
cubicle in Pittsburgh. Then, quick- 
ly pursing his lips and scowling, he 
begins to make his notations. 

He frequently goes nightwalking 
but never in his own city of Shang- 
hai. Jason’s one audacity: boldly 
he flouts the tradition that one 
should stay close to home during 
one’s nocturnal prowls. No one 
will punish him for his unconven- 
tional behavior, since it is merely 
a violation of accepted custom, 
not of urban law. No one will even 
criticize him to his face for doing 
it. Yet his wanderings give him the 
mild thrill of the forbidden. Jason 
explains his habit to himself by 
saying that he prefers the crosscul-

tural enrichment that comes from 
sleeping with women of other cit- 
ies. Privately he suspects that he is 
just uneasy about getting mixed 
up with women he knows, such as 
Mamelon Kluver. Especially 
Mamelon Kluver. 

So on his nightwalking nights he 
takes the dropshafts far into the 
depths of the building, to such cit- 
ies as Pittsburgh or Tokyo, even 
to squalid Prague or grubby Reyk- 
javik. He pushes open strange 
doors, lockless by statute, and 
takes his place on the sleeping 
platforms of unknown women 
smelling of mysterious lower-class 
vegetables. By law they must em- 
brace him willingly. “I am from 
Shanghai,” he tells them, and they 
go, “Ooooh!” in awe and he 
mounts them tigerishly, contemp- 
tuously, swollen with status. 

Breasty Gretl waits patiently 
while Jason records his latest no- 
tions. Then he turns toward her 
again. Her husband, bloated on 
whatever the local equivalent of 
tingle or mindblot may be, lies 
belly-up at the far side of the sleep- 
ing platform, ignoring them. 
Gretl’s large dark eyes glow with 
admiration. “You Shanghai boys 
sure got brains,” she says as Jason 
pounces and takes her in a single 
fierce act. 

Later he returns to the 761st 
floor. Wraiths flit through the dim 
corridors: other citizens of Shang- 
hai, back from their own night- 
walking rounds. He enters his 
apartment. Jason has forty-five 
square meters of floor space, not 
really enough for a man with a 
wife and five fifties, but he does 



not complain. God bless, you take 
what you get; others have less. Mi- 
caela is asleep, or pretends to be. 
She is a long-legged, tawny- 
skinned woman of twenty-three, 
still quite attractive, though quirky 
fines are beginning to appear in her 
face. She frowns too much. She 
lies half uncovered, her long black 
glossy hair spread out wildly 
around her. Her breasts are small 
but perfect; Jason compares them 
favorably to the udders of Tokyo’s 
Gretl. He and Micaela have been 
married nine years. Once he loved 
her a great deal — before he discov- 
ered the gritty residue of bitter 
shrewishness at the bottom of her 
soul. 

She smiles an inward smile, 
stirs, still sleeping, brushes her 
hair back from her eyes. She has 
the look of a woman who has just 
had a thoroughly satisfactory sex- 
ual experience. Jason has no way 
of knowing whether some night- 
walker visited Micaela tonight 
while he was gone and, of course, 
he cannot ask. (Search for evi- 
dence? Stains on the sleeping plat- 
form? Stickiness on her thighs? 
Don’t be barbaric!) He suspects 
that even if no one had come to 
her tonight, she would try to make 
him think that someone had; and 
if someone had come and had giv- 
en her only modest pleasure, she 
would nevertheless smile for her 
husband’s benefit as though she 
has been embraced by Zeus. He 
knows his wife’s style. 

, The children seem peaceful. 
They range in age from two to 
eight. Soon he and Micaela will 
have to think about having anoth-

er. Five littles is a fair-sized family 
but Jason understands his duty to 
serve life by creating life. When 
one ceases to grow, one begins to 
die; it is true of a human being and 
also of the population of an urban 
monad, of an urbmon constella- 
tion, of a continent, of a world. 
God is life and life is god. 

He lies down beside his wife. 

He sleeps. 

He dreams that Micaela has 
been sentenced to the chute for 
countersocial behavior. 

Down she goes! Mamelon Klu- 
ver makes a condolence call. 
“Poor Jason,” she murmurs. Her 
pale skin is cool against him. The 
musky fragrance of her. The ele- 
gance of her features. The look of 
total mastery of self. Not even 
seventeen; how can she be so im- 
periously complete? “Help me dis- 
pose of Siegmund and we’ll belong 
to each other,” Mamelon says. 
Eyes bright, mischievous, goading 
him to be her creature. “Jason,” 
she whispers. “Jason, Jason, Ja- 
son.” Her tone a caress. Her 
hands on him. He wakes, trem- 
bling, sweating, horrified, half an 
inch from messy ecstasy. He sits 
up and goes through one of the 
forgiveness modes for improper 
thoughts. 

God bless, he thinks, god bless, 
god bless, god bless. I did not 
mean such things. It was my mind. 
My monstrous mind free of shack- 
les. He completes the spiritual ex- 
ercise and lies down once more. 
He sleeps and dreams harmlessly. 

I N THE morning the littles run 
madly off to school and Jason 



prepares to go to his office. Mi- 
caela says suddenly, “Isn’t it inter- 
esting that you go six hundred 
floors down when you go to work, 
and Siegmund Kluver goes up on 
top, to Louisville?” 

“What the god bless do you 
mean by that?” 

“I see symbolic meaning in it.” 

“Symbolic garbage. Siegmund’s 
in urban administration — he goes 
up where the administrators are. 
I’m in history — I go down where 
the history is. So?” 

“Wouldn’t you like to live in 
Louisville some day?” 

“No.” 

“Why don’t you have any am- 
bition?” 

“Is your life so miserable here?” 
he asks, holding himself tensely in 
check. 

“Why has Siegmund made so 
much of himself at the age of 
fourteen or fifteen and here you 
are at twenty-six and you’re still 
just an input-pusher?” 

“Siegmund is ambitious,” Jason 
replies evenly, “and I’m merely a 
time-server. I don’t deny it. May- 
be it’s genetic. Siegmund strives 
and gets away with it. Most men 
don’t. Striving sterilizes, Micaela. 
Striving is primitive. God bless, 
what’s wrong with my career? 
What’s wrong with living in Shang- 
hai?” 

“One floor lower and we’d be 
living in — ” 

“ — Chicago,” he says. “I know. 
But we aren’t. May I go to my of- 
fice now?” 

He leaves. He wonders whether 
he ought to send Micaela to the 
consoler’s office for a reality ad-

justment. Her threshold of thwart- 
ing-acceptance has dipped alarm- 
ingly of late; her expectations-level 
has risen just as disturbingly. Ja- 
son is well aware that such things 
should be dealt with at once, be- 
fore they become uncontrollable 
and lead to countersocial behavior 
and the chute. Probably Micaela 
needs the services of the moral en- 
gineers. But he puts aside the idea 
of calling the consoler. 

It is because I dislike the idea of 
having anyone tamper with my 
wife’s mind. 

He tells himself this piously and 
a mocking inner voice tells him 
that he is taking no action because 
he secretly wishes to see Micaela 
become so countersocial that she 
must be thrown down the chute. 

He enters the dropshaft and pro- 
grams for the 185th floor. Down 
he goes to Pittsburgh. He sinks, 
inertia-free, through the cities that 
make up Urbmon 116. Down he 
goes through Chicago, through 
Edinburgh, through Nairobi, 
through Colombo. 

Forty floors constitute one city. 
The twenty-five cities of Urbmon 
1 16 comprise the successive layers 
of a single great urban monad, a 
tower of super-stressed concrete 
three kilometers high, a self-con- 
tained unit housing more than 

800.000 human beings. Most cities 
within the urbmon have between 

30.000 and 40,000 people but there 
are exceptions. Louisville, the 
high-prestige abode of the urban 
administrators, is sparsely popu- 
lated; luxury is the compensation 
one is given for the burdens of 
such responsibility. Reykjavik, 



Warsaw and Prague, the three bot- 
tom cities where the maintenance 
workers and other humble grub- 
bers live, are overpopulated; 
crowding is considered beneficial 
there. Everything is conceived for 
the greater good. 

Urbmon 116 looks after itself. 
Its central service core provides 
light, fresh air, heating, cooling 
and other essentials. Central kitch- 
ens handle most of the food-pro- 
cessing chores. Below ground lev- 
el, 400 meters down, is found the 
utilities substructure: refuse com- 
pactors, the plants for the repro- 
cessing of wastes, the heat-sink, 
the power generators and every- 
thing else on which the life of the 
urbmon depends. Food is the only 
thing that must come from out- 
side — from the agricultural com- 
munes that lie beyond the urban 
area. Jason’s building is one of 
fifty-odd identical structures mak- 
ing up the Chipitts urban constel- 
lation, which in this year of 2382 
has a population of close to 
41,000,000. There are many other 
such urban constellations in the 
world — Boshwash, Sansan, Shan- 
kong, Bocarac, Wienbud — and the 
aggregate human population of 
Earth has risen well past 75,000, 
000,000. Because of the new verti- 
cality of urban housing patterns, 
there is ample land for meeting the 
food requirements of that many 
people and more. 

He feels the comforting solidity 
of the building about him as he de- 
scends. The urbmon is his world. 
He has never been outside it. Why 
should he go out? His friends, his 
family, his whole life, are here. 



THE THROWBACKS

His urbmon is adequately supplied 
with theaters, sports arenas, 
schools, hospitals, houses of wor- 
ship. His data terminal gives him 
access to any work of art that is 
considered blessworthy for human 
consumption. No one he knows 
has ever left the building, except 
for the people who were chosen by 
lot to settle in the newly opened 
Urbmon 158 a few months ago and 
they, of course, will never come 
back. There are rumors that ur- 
ban administrators sometimes go 
from building to building on busi- 
ness but Jason is not sure that this 
is true and he does not see why 
such travel would be necessary or 
desirable. Are there not systems of 
instantaneous communication link- 
ing the urbmons, capable of trans- 
mitting all relevant data? 

I T IS a splendid system. As a his- 
torian, privileged to explore the 
records of the pre-urbmon world, 
he knows more fully than most 
people how splendid it is. He un- 
derstands the awful chaos of the 
past. The terrifying freedoms; the 
hideous necessity of making 
choices. The insecurity. The con- 
fusion. The lack of plan. The 
formlessness of contexts. 

He reaches the 185th floor. He 
makes his way through the sleepy 
corridors of Pittsburgh to his of- 
fice. A modest room but he loves 
it. Glistening walls. A wet mural 
over his desk. The necessary ter- 
minals and screens. 

Five small glistening cubes lie 
on his desk. Each holds the con- 
tents of several libraries. He has 
been working with these cubes for 



two years, now. His theme is The 
Urban Monad as Social Evolu- 
tion: Parameters of the Spirit De- 
fined by Community Structure. 
He is attempting to show that the 
transition to an urbmon society 
has brought about a fundamental 
transformation of the human soul. 
Of the soul of western man, at any 
rate. An orientalization of the oc- 
cidentals, as formerly aggressive 
people accept the yoke of the new 
environment. A more pliant, more 
acquiescent mode of response to 
events; a turning away from the 
old expansionist-individualist phi- 
losophy, as marked by territorial 
ambition, the conquistador men- 
tality and the pioneering way, to- 
ward a kind of communal expan- 
sionism centered in the orderly and 
unlimited growth of the human 
race. Definitely a psychic evolu- 
tion of some sort, a shift toward 
graceful acceptance of hive-life. 
The malcontents bred out of the 
system generations ago. We who 
have not gone down the chute ac- 
cept the inexorabilities. Yes. Yes. 
Jason believes that he has struck 
upon a significant subject. Micae- 
la disparaged the theme when he 
announced it: “You mean you’re 
going to write a book showing that 
people who live in different kinds 
of cities are different? That urb- 
mon people have a different atti- 
tude than jungle people? Some 
scholar. I could prove your point 
in six sentences.” Nor was there 
much enthusiasm for the subject 
when he proposed it at a staff 
meeting, although he did manage 
to get clearance for it. His tech- 
nique so far has been to steep him- 



32 



GALAXY 




self in the images of the past, to 
turn himself, so far as is possible, 
into a citizen of the pre-urbmon 
society. He hopes that that will 
give him the essential parallax, the 
perspective on his own society, 
that he will need when he begins to 
write his study. He expects to start 
writing in two or three years. 

He consults a memorandum, 
chooses a cube. 

A kind of ecstasy comes over 
him as scenes out of the ancient 
world materialize. He leans close 
to his input speaker and begins to 
dictate. Frantically, frenziedly, Ja- 
son Quevedo sets down notes on 
the way it used to be.

H ouses and streets. A hori- 
zontal world. Individual family

square meters of surface. Roads. 
Concept of road hard for us to un- 
derstand. Like a hallway going on

are they all going? Why so fast? 
Why not stay home? Crash! 
Blood. Head goes through glass.

Estimated grid reading: 10,000 pe- 
destrians this sector alone, in strip 
8 meters wide and 80 meters long. 
Is that figure right? Check it. El- 



bow to elbow. And they’d think 
our world was overcrowded? At 
least we don’t impinge on each 
other like that. We know how to 
keep our distances within the over- 
all structure of urbmon life. Ve- 
hicles move down middle of street. 
The good old chaos. Chief activ- 
ity: the purchase of goods. Private 
consumption. Cube IlAb8 shows 
interior vector of a shop. Exchang- 
ing of money for merchandise. 
Not much difference there except 
random nature of transaction. Do 
they need what they buy? Where 
do they PUT it all? 

This cube holds nothing new for 
him. Jason has seen such city 
scenes many times before. Yet the 
fascination is ever fresh. He is 
tense, sweat flowing freely, as he 
strains to comprehend a world in 
which people may live where they 
please, where they move about on 
foot or in vehicles in the open, 
where there is no planning, no or- 
der, no restraint. He must perform 
a double act of imagination: it is 
necessary for him to see that van- 
ished world from within, as though 
he lived in it and then he must try 
to see the urbmon society as it 
might seem to someone wafted 
forward from the twentieth centu- 
ry. The magnitude of the task dis- 
mays him. He knows roughly how 
an ancient would feel about Urb- 
mon 116: it is a hellish place, the 
ancient would say, in which people 
live hideously cramped and brutal 
lives, in which every civilized phi- 
losophy is turned on its head, in 
which uncontrolled breeding is 
nightmarishly encouraged to serve

justed, fully content? These are 
topics he means to explore inten- 
sively when he writes his book. But 
it is so hard, so absurdly hard, to 
grasp them from the viewpoint of 
ancient man! 

Jason struggles to understand 
the uproar over overpopulation in 
the ancient world. He has drawn 
from the archives scores of tracts 
directed against indiscriminate hu- 
man spawning — angry polemics 
composed at a time when less than 
4,000,000,000 people inhabited the 
world. He is aware, of course, that 



humans can choke a whole planet 
quickly when they live spread out 
horizontally the way they did; but 
why were they so worried about 
the future? Surely they could have 
foreseen the beauties of the verti- 
cal society! 

No. No. That’s just the point, 
he tells himself unhappily. They 
did not foresee any such thing. In- 
stead they talked about limiting 
fertility, if necessary by imposing 
a governmental authority to hold 
population down. Jason shivers. 
Don’t you see. he asks his cubes. 



THE THROWBACKS 



35 




that only a totalitarian regime 
could enforce such limits? You 
say that we’re a repressive society. 
But what kind of society would 
you have built if the urbmons 
hadn’t developed? 

The voice of ancient man re- 
plies, I’d rather take my chances 
on limiting births and allowing 
complete freedom otherwise. 
You’ve accepted the freedom to 
multiply but it’s cost you all the 
other freedoms. Don’t you see — 

You’re the one who doesn’t see, 
Jason blurts. A society must sus- 
tain its momentum through the 
exploitation of god-given fertility. 
We’ve found a way to make room 
for everybody on Earth, to sup- 
port a population ten or twenty 
times greater than what you imag- 
ined was the absolute maximum. 
You see it merely as suppression 
and authoritarianism. But what 
about the billions of lives that 
could never have come into being 
at all under your system? Isn’t 
that the ultimate suppression: for- 
bidding humans to exist in the first 
place? 

But what good is letting them 
exist if the best they can hope for 
is a box inside a box? What about 
the quality of life? 

I see no defects in the quality of 
our life. We find fulfillment in the 
interplay of human relationships. 
Do I need to go to China or A fri- 
ca for my pleasures when I can 
find them within a single building? 
Isn’t it a sign of inner dislocation 
to feel compelled to roam all over 
the world? In your day everybody 
traveled, I know, and in mine no 
one does. Which is a more stable 



society? Which is the happier one? 

Which is more human? Which 
exploits man’s potential more 
fully? Isn’t it our nature to seek, 
to strive, to reach out? 

What about seeking within? Ex- 
ploring the inner life? 

But don’t you see — 

But don’t you see — 

If you only would listen — 

If you only would listen — 

Jason does not see. Ancient 
man’s spokesman does not see. 
Neither will listen. There is no 
communication. Jason wastes an- 
other dismal day wrestling with his 
intractable material. Only as he is 
about to leave does he remember 
last night’s memorandum. He will 
study ancient sexual mores in a 
new attempt to gain insight into 
that vanished society. He punches 
out hk requisition. The cubes will 
be on his desk when he returns to 
his office tomorrow. 

He goes home to Shanghai, 
home to Micaela. 

T hat evening the Quevedos 
have dinner guests; Michael, 
Micaela’s twin brother, and his 
wife Stacion. Michael is a com- 
puter-primer; he and Stacion live 
in Edinburgh, on the 704th floor. 
Jason finds his company challeng- 
ing and rewarding, although the 
physical resemblance between his 
brother-in-law and his wife, which 
he once found amusing, now 
alarms and disturbs him. Michael 
affects shoulder-length hair, and is 
barely a centimeter taller than his 
tall, slender sister. They are, of 
course, only fraternal twins, yet 
their facial features are virtually 



36 



GALAXY 




identical. They have even settled 
into the same pattern of tense, 
querulous smirks and scowls. 
From the rear Jason has difficul- 
ties in telling them apart unless he 
sees them side by side; they stand 
the same way, arms akimbo, heads 
tilted backward. Since Micaela is 
small-breasted, the possibility of 
confusion exists also in profile and 
sometimes, looking at one of 
them in front view, Jason has mo- 
mentarily wondered whether he 
beholds Michael or Micaela. If 
only Michael would grow a beard! 
But his cheeks are smooth. 

Now and again Jason feels sex- 
ually drawn to his brother-in-law. 
It is a natural attraction, consid- 
ering the physical pull Micaela has 
always exerted on him. Seeing her 
across the room, angled away 
from him, her smooth back bare, 
the little globe of one breast visi- 
ble under her arm as she reaches 
toward the data terminal, he feels 
the urge to go to her and caress 
her. And if she were Michael? And 
if he slid his hand to her bosom 
and found it flat and hard? And if 
they tumbled down together in a 
passionate tangle? His hand going 
to Micaela’s thighs and finding not 
the hot hidden slot but the dang- 
ling flesh of maleness? And turn- 
ing her over. Him? Parting the 
pallid muscular buttocks. The 
sudden strange thrust. No. Jason 
flushes the fantasy from his mind. 
Once again. Not since the rough 
easy days of boyhood has he had 
any kind of sexual contact with 
his own sex. He will not permit it. 
There are no penalties for such 
things, naturally, in the society of 



the urbmon, where all adults are 
equally accessible. Many of them 
do it. For all he knows, Michael 
himself. If Jason wants Michael, 
he has only to ask. Refusal a sin. 
He does not ask. He fights the 
temptation. It is not fair, a man 
who looks so much like my wife. 
The devil’s snare. Why do I resist, 
though? If I want him, why not 
take? But no. I don't really want. 
It’s just a sneaky urge, a sidewise 
way of desiring Micaela. And yet 
the fantasy surges again. Himself 
and Michael, spoofi-fashion, 
mouths gaping and stuffed. The 
image glows so brightly that Jason 
rises in a brusque tense motion, 
knocking over the flask of wine 
that Stacion has brought tonight 
and, as Stacion dives for and res- 
cues it, he crosses the room, 
aghast at the erection prodding his 
taut gold-and-green shorts. He 
goes to Micaela and cups one of 
her breasts. The nipple is soft. He 
snuggles against her, nibbles the 
nape of her neck. She tolerates 
these attentions in a remote way, 
not interrupting the programing 
of dinner. But when, still dis- 
traught, he slips his left hand into 
the open side of her sarong and 
runs it across her belly to her 
loins, she wriggles her hips in dis- 
pleasure and whispers harshly, 
“Stop it! Not with them sitting 
there!” 

Wildly he finds the fumes and 
offers them around. Stacion re- 
fuses; she is pregnant. A plump, 
pleasant, red-haired girl, compla- 
cent, easy. Out of place in this 
congregation of the hyptertense. 
Jason sucks the smoke deep and 



THE THROWBACKS 



37 




feels the knots loosen slightly in- 
side. Now he can look at Michael 
and not fall prey to unnatural 
urges. Yet he still speculates. Does 
Michael suspect? Would he laugh 
if I told him? Take offense? Angry 
at me for wanting to? Angry at 
me for not trying to? Suppose he 
asked me to, what would 1 do? 
Jason takes a second fume and the 
swarm of buzzing questions leaves 
his mind. “When is the little due?” 
he asks, in counterfeit geniality. 

“God bless, fourteen weeks,” 
Michael says. “Number five. A 
girl, this time.” 

“We’ll name her Celeste,” Sta- 
cion puts in, patting her middle. 
Her maternity costume is a short 
yellow bolero and a loose brown 
waist-sash. Leaving the bulging 
belly bare. The everted navel like 
the stem of the swollen fruit. 
Milky breasts swaying in and out 
of visibility under the open jacket. 
“We’re talking about requesting 
twins for next year,” she adds. “A 
boy and a girl. Michael’s always 
telling me about the good times 
he and Micaela used to have to- 
gether when they were young. Like 
a special world for twins.” 

Jason is caught unawares by the 
bringdown and is plunged abruptly 
into feverish fantasy once more. 
He sees Micaela’s spread legs 
sticking out from under Michael’s 
lean pumping body, sees her child- 
ish ecstatic face looking up over 
his busy shoulder. The good times 
they used to have. Michael the 
first one into her. At nine — ten, 
maybe? Even younger? Their awk- 
ward experiments. Let me get on 
top of you this time, Michael. Oh, 



it’s deeper this way. Do you think 
we’re doing anything wrong? No, 
silly, didn’t we sleep together for 
nine whole months? Put your hand 
here. And your mouth on me 
again. Yes. You’re hurting my 
breasts, Michael. Oh, that’s nice. 
But wait just another few seconds 
. the good times they used to 
have. “Is something the matter, 
Jason?” Michael’s voice. “You 
look so tight.” Jason forces him- 
self to pull out of it. Hands trem- 
bling. Another fume. He rarely 
takes three before dinner. 

S TACION has gone to help Mi- 
caela unload the food from the 
delivery slot. Michael says to Ja- 
son, “I hear you’ve started a new 
research project. What’s the basic 
theme?” 

Kind of him. Senses that I’m ill 
at ease. Draw me out of my mor- 
bid brooding. All these sick 
thoughts . 

Jason replies, “I’m investigating 
the notion that urbmon life is 
breeding a new kind of human be- 
ing. A type that adapts readily to 
relatively little living space and a 
low privacy quotient.” 

“You mean a genetic muta- 
tion?” Michael asks, frowning. 
“Literally an inherited social char- 
acteristic?” 

“So I believe.” 

“Are such things possible, 
though? Can you call it a genetic 
trait, really, if people voluntarily 
decide to band together in a so- 
ciety like ours and — ” 
“Voluntarily?” 

“Isn’t it?” 

Jason smiles. “I doubt that it

ever was. In the beginning, you 
know, it was a matter of necessity. 
Because of the chaos in the world. 
Seal yourself up in your building 
or be exposed to the food bandits. 
I’m talking about the famine 
years, now. And since then, since 
everything stabilized, has it been 
so voluntary? Do we have any 
choice about where we live?” 

“I suppose we could go outside 
if we really wanted to,” Michael 
says, “and live in whatever they’ve 
got out there.” 

“But we don’t. Because we rec- 
ognize that that’s a hopeless fanta- 
sy. We stay here, whether we like 
it or not. And those who don’t like 
it, those who eventually can’t take 
it — well, you know what happens 
to them.” 

“But—” 

“Wait. Two centuries of selec- 
tive breeding, Michael. Down the 
chute for the flippos. And no 
doubt some population loss 
through leaving the buildings, at 
least at the beginning. Those who 
remain adapt to circumstances. 
They like the urbmon way. It 
seems altogether natural to them.” 

“Is this really genetic, though? 
Couldn’t you simply call it psy- 
chological conditioning? I mean, 
in the Asian countries, didn’t peo- 
ple always live jammed together 
the way we do, only much worse, 
no sanitation, no regulation — and 
didn’t they accept it as the natural 
order of things?” 

/‘Of course,” Jason says. “Be- 
cause rebellion against the natural 
order of things had been bred out 
of them thousands of years ago. 
The ones who stayed, the ones who 



reproduced, were the ones who 
accepted things as they were. The 
same here.” 

Doubtfully Michael says, “How 
can you draw the line between psy- 
chological conditioning and long- 
term selective breeding? How do 
you know what to attribute to 
which?” 

“I haven’t faced that problem 
yet,” Jason admits. 

“Shouldn’t you be working with 
a geneticist?” 

“Perhaps later 1 will. After I’ve 
established my parameters of in- 
quiry. You know. I’m not ready to 
defend this thesis, yet. I’m just col- 
lecting data to discover if it can be 
defended. The scientific method. 
We don’t make a priori assump- 
tions and look around for sup- 
porting evidence. We examine the 
evidence first and — ” 

“Yes, yes, I know. Just between 
us, though, you do think it’s really 
happening, don’t you? An urbmon 
species.” 

“I do. Yes. Two centuries of se- 
lective breeding, pretty ruthlessly 
enforced. And all of us so well 
adapted now to this kind of life.” 

“Ah. Yes. All of us so well 
adapted.” 

“With some exceptions,” Jason 
says, retreating a bit. He and 
Michael exchange wary glances. 
Jason wonders what thoughts lie 
behind his brother-in-law’s cool 
eyes. “General acceptance, though. 
Where has the old western expan- 
sionist philosophy gone? Bred out 
of the race, I say. The urge to 
power? The love of conquest? The 
hunger for land and property? 
Gone. Gone. Gone. I don’t think

that s just a conditioning process. 
I suspect it’s a matter of stripping 
the race of certain genes that lead 
to—” 

“Dinner, professor,” Micaela 
calls. 

A costly meal. Proteoid steaks, 
root salad, bubble pudding, relish- 
es, fish soup. Nothing reconsti- 
tuted and hardly anything synthet- 
ic. For the next two weeks he and 
Micaela will have to go on short 
rations until they’ve made up the 
deficit in their luxury allotment. 
He conceals his annoyance. Mich- 
ael always eats lavishly when he 
comes here; Jason wonders why, 
since Micaela is not nearly so so- 
licitous of her seven other brothers 
and sisters. Scarcely ever invites 
two or three of them. But Michael 
here at least five times a year, al- 
ways getting a feast. Jason’s sus- 
picions reawaken. Something ugly 
going on between those two? The 
childhood passions still smoulder- 
ing? Perhaps it is cute for twelve- 
year-old twins to couple but 
should they still be at it when 
twenty-three and married? Michael 
a nightwalker in my sleeping plat- 
form? Jason is annoyed at himself. 
Not bad enough that he has to fret 
over his idiotic homosexual fixa- 
tion on Michael; now he has to 
torment himself with fears of an 
incestuous affair behind his back. 
Poisoning his hours of relaxation. 
What if they are? Nothing socially 
objectionable in it. Seek pleasure 
where you will. In your sister’s 
slot if you be so moved. Shall all 
the men of Urban Monad 116 
have access to Micaela Quevedo, 
save only the unfortunate Mich- 



ael? Must his status as her womb- 
mate deny her to him? Be realis- 
tic, Jason tells himself. Incest ta- 
boos make sense only where breed- 
ing is involved. Anyway, they pro- 
bably aren’t doing it, probably 
never have ... He wonders why so 
much nastiness has sprouted in his 
soul lately. The frictions of living 
with Micaela, he decides. Her 
coldness is driving me into all 
kinds of unblessworthy attitudes, 
the bitch. If she doesn’t stop goad- 
ing me I’ll . I’ll what? Seduce 
Michael away from her? 

He laughs at the intricacy of his 
own edifice of schemes. 

S OMETHING funny?” Micaela 
asks. “Share it with us, Ja- 
son.” 

He looks up, helpless. What 
shall he say? “A silly thought,” 
he improvises. “About you and 
Michael, how much you look like 
each other. I was thinking — per- 
haps some night you and he could 
switch rooms and a nightwalker 
would come here looking for you. 
But when he actually got under the 
covers with you he’d discover that 
he was in bed with a man and — 
and — ” Jason is smitten with the 
overwhelming fatuity of what he 
is saying and descends into a feeble 
silence. 

“What a peculiar thing to imag- 
ine,” Micaela says. 

“Besides, so what?” Stacion 
asks. “The nightwalker might be a 
little surprised for a minute, may- 
be, but then he’d just go ahead and 
make it with Michael, wouldn’t 
he? Rather than make a big scene 
or bother to go someplace else. So 
I don’t see what’s funny.”

“Forget it,” Jason growls. “I 
told you it was silly. Micaela in- 
sisted on knowing what was cross- 
ing my mind and I told you. But 
I’m not responsible if it doesn’t 
make any sense, am I? Am I?” He 
grabs the flask of wine and pours 
most of what remains into his cup. 
“This is good stuff,” he mutters. 

After dinner they share an ex- 
pander, all but Stacion. They 
groove in silence for a couple of 
hours. Shortly before midnight 
Michael and Stacion leave. Jason 
does not watch as his wife and her 
brother make their farewell em- 
braces. As soon as the guests are 
gone, Micaela strips away her sa- 
rong and gives him a bright, fierce 
stare, almost defying him to have 
her tonight. But though he knows 
it is unkind to ignore her wordless 
invitation, he is so depressed by his 
own inner performance this eve- 
ning that he feels he must flee. 
“Sorry,” he says. “I’m restless.” 
Her expression changes; desire 
fades and is replaced by bewilder- 
ment, then by rage. He does not 
wait. Hastily he goes out, rushing 
to the dropshaft and plummeting 
to the 59th floor. Warsaw. He en- 
ters an apartment and finds a 
woman of about thirty, with fuzzy 
blonde hair and a soft fleshy body, 
asleep alone on an unkempt sleep- 
ing platform. At least eight littles 
stacked up on cots in the corners. 
He wakes her. “Jason Quevedo,” 
he says. “I’m from Shanghai.” 

She blinks. Having trouble fo- 
cusing her eyes. “Shanghai? But 
are you supposed to be here?” 
“Who says I can’t?” 

She ponders that. “Nobody 



says. But Shanghai never comes 
here. Really, Shanghai? You?” 
“Do I have to show you my 
identiplate?” he asks harshly. 

His educated inflections destroy 
her resistance. She begins to 
primp, arranging her hair, reach- 
ing for some kind of cosmetic 
spray for her face, while he drops 
his clothing. He mounts the plat- 
form. She draws her knees up al- 
most to her breasts, presenting 
herself. Crudely, impatiently, he 
takes her. Michael, he thinks. Mi- 
caela. Michael. Micaela. Grunt- 
ing, he floods her. 

Ill 

I N THE morning, at his office, 
he begins his newest line of in- 
quiry, summoning up data on the 
sexual mores of ancient times. As 
usual he concentrates on the twen- 
tieth century, which he regards as 
the climax of the ancient era and 
therefore most significant, reveal- 
ing as it does the entire cluster of 
attitudes and responses that had 
accumulated in the pre-urbmon in- 
dustrial era. The twenty-first cen- 
tury is less useful for his purposes, 
being, like all transitional periods, 
essentially chaotic and unschemat- 
ic, and the twenty-second century 
brings him into modern times with 
the beginning of the urbmon age. 
So the twentieth is his favorite 
area of study. Seeds of the col- 
lapse, portents of doom running 
through it like bad-trip threads in 
a psychedelic tapestry. 

Jason is careful not to fall vic- 
tim to the historian’s fallacy of 
diminished perspective. Though 



THE THROWBACKS

the twentieth century, seen from 
this distance, seems to be a single 
seamless entity, he knows that this 
is an error of evaluation caused by 
overfacile abstracting; there may 
be certain apparent patterns that 
ride one unbroken curve across the 
ten decades but he realizes that he 
must allow for certain qualitative 
changes in society that have cre- 
ated major historical discontinui- 
ties between decade and decade. 
The unleashing of atomic energy 
created one such discontinuity. 
The development of swift intercon- 
tinental transporation formed an- 
other. In the moral sphere, the 
availability of simple and reliable 
contraception caused a fundamen- 
tal change in sexual attitudes, a 
revolution not to be ascribed to 
mere rebelliousness. The arrival of 
the psychedelic age, with its spe- 
cial problems and joys, marked 
one more great gulf, setting off 
part of the century from all that 
went before. So 1910 and 1930 and 
1950 and 1970 and 1990 occupy in- 
dividual summits in Jason’s jagged 
image of the century, and in any 
sampling of its mentality that he 
takes, he draws evidence from 
each of its discrete subepochs. 

Plenty of evidence is available 
to him. Despite the dislocations 
caused by the collapse an enor- 
mous weight of data on the eras 
of pre-urbmon time exists, stored 
in some subterranean vault, Jason 
knows not where. Certainly the 
central data bank (if there is in- 
deed only one and not a redundant 
series of them scattered through 
the world) is not anywhere in Urb- 
mon 116 and he doubts that it is 



even in the Chipitts constellation. 
It does not matter. He can draw 
from that vast deposit any infor- 
mation that he requires and it will 
come instantaneously. The trick 
lies in knowing what to ask for. 

He is familiar enough with the 
sources to be able to make intelli - ' 
gent data requisitions. He thumbs 
the keys and the new cubes arrive. 
Novels. Films. Television pro- 
grams. Leaflets. Handbills. He 
knows that for more than half the 
century popular attitudes toward 
sexual matters were recorded both 
in licit and illicit channels — the or- 
dinary novels and motion pictures 
of the day and an underground 
stream of clandestine, “forbidden” 
erotic works. Jason draws from 
both groups. He must weigh the 
distortions of the erotica against 
the distortions of the legitimate 
material; only out of this New- 
tonian interplay of forces can the 
objective truth be mined. Then, 
too, he surveys the legal codes, 
making the appropriate allow- 
ances for laws observed only in the 
breach. What is this in the laws of 
New York: “A person who wil- 
fully and lewdly exposes his person 
or the private parts thereof, in any 
public place, or in any place where 
others are present, or procures an- 
other to so expose himself shall 
be guilty of. .” Guilty of what? 
In the state of Georgia, he reads, 
any sleeping car passenger who re- 
mains in a compartment other 
than the one to which he is as- 
signed is guilty of a misdemeanor 
and is subject to a maximum fine 
of $1000 or twelve months’ impris- 
bnment. The laws of the state of 



42 



GALAXY 




Michigan tell him, “Any person 
who shall undertake to medically 
treat any female person, and while 
so treating her shall represent to 
such female that it is, or will be 
necessary or beneficial to her 
health that she shall have sexual 
intercourse with a man, and any 
man, not being the husband of 
such female, who shall have sexual 
intercourse with her by reason of 
such representation, shall be guilty 
of a felony, and be punished by a 
maximum term of 10 years.” 
Strange. Stranger still: “Every 
person who shall carnally know, 
or shall have sexual intercourse in 
any manner with any animal or 
bird, is guilty of sodomy. .” No 
wonder everything’s extinct! And 
this? “Whoever shall carnally 
know any male or female by the 
anus (rectum) or with the mouth 
or tongue, or who shall attempt 
intercourse with a dead body. 
$2000 and/or five years’ imprison- 
ment. .” Most chilling of all: in 
Connecticut the use of contracep- 
tive articles is forbidden, under 
penalty of a minimum fine of fifty 
dollars or sixty days to one year 
in prison — and in Massachusetts 
“whoever sells, lends, gives, exhib- 
its (or offers to) any instrument 
or drug, or medicine, or any arti- 
cle whatever for the prevention of 
conception, shall be subject to a 
maximum term of five years in 
prison or a maximum fine of 
$1000.” What? What? Send a man 
to prison for decades for cun- 
nilingualizing his wife and impose 
so trifling a sentence on the 
spreaders of contraception? Where 
was Connecticut, anyway? Where 



was Massachusetts? Historian 
that he is, he is not sure. God 
bless, he thinks, but the doom that 
came upon them was well merited. 
A bizarre folk to deal so lightly 
with those who would limit births! 

H e skims a few novels and 
dips into several films. Even 
though it is only the first day of 
his research, he perceives patterns, 
a fitful loosening of taboos 
throughout the century, acceler- 
ating greatly between 1920 and 
1930 and again after 1960. Timid 
experiments in revealing the ankle 
lead, shortly, to bared breasts. 
The curious custom of prostitu- 
tion erodes as liberties become 
more commonly obtained. The 
disappearance of taboos on the 
popular sexual vocabulary. He can 
barely believe some of what he 
learns. So compressed were their 
souls! So thwarted were their 
urges! And why? And why? Of 
course, they did grow looser. Yet 
terrible restraints prevail through- 
out that dark century, except to- 
ward the end, when the collapse 
was their liberation. He sees a 
forced, self-conscious mode of 
amorality coming into being. The 
shy nudists. The guilt-wracked 
orgiasts. The apologetic adulter- 
ers. Strange, strange, strange. He 
is endlessly fascinated by the twen- 
tieth century’s sexual concepts. 
The wife as husband’s property. 
The premium on virginity: well, 
they seemed to get rid of that\ At- 
tempts by the state to dictate posi- 
tions of sexual intercourse and to 
forbid certain supplementary acts. 
The restrictions even on words! A

phrase leaps out of a supposedly 
serious twentieth-century work of 
social criticism: “Among the most 
significant developments of the 
decade was the attainment of the 
freedom, at last, for the responsi- 
ble writer to use such words as 
fuck and cunt where necessary in 
his work.” Can that have been so? 
Such importance placed on mere 
words? Jason pronounces the odd 
monosyllables aloud in his re- 
search cubicle. “Fuck. Cunt. Fuck. 
Cunt. Fuck.” They sound merely 
antiquated. Harmless, certainly. 
He tries the modern equivalents. 
“Top. Slot. Top. Slot. Top.” No 
impact. How can words ever have 
held such inflammatory content 
that an apparently penetrating 
scholar would feel it worthwhile to 
celebrate their free public use? Ja- 
son is aware of his limitations as a 
historian when he runs into such 
things. He simply cannot compre- 
hend the twentieth-century’s ob- 
session with words. To insist on 
giving God a capital letter, as 
though He might be displeased to 
be called god! To suppress books 
for printing words like c--t and 
f— k and s— t! 

By the close of his day’s work 
he is more convinced than ever of 
the validity of his thesis. There has 
been a monumental change in sex- 
ual morality in the past three hun- 
dred years and it cannot be ex- 
plained only on cultural grounds. 
We are different, he tells himself. 
We have changed and it is a cel- 
lular change, a transformation of 
the body as well as the soul. They 
could not have permitted, let alone 
encouraged, our total-accessibility 



society. Our night walking, our nu- 
dity, our freedom from taboos, 
our lack of irrational jealousies, 
all of this would have been wholly 
alien to them, distasteful, abomin- 
able. Even those who lived in a 
way approaching ours — and there 
were a few — did so for the wrong 
reasons. They were responding not 
to a positive societal need but to 
an existing system of repression. 
We are different. We are funda- 
mentally different. 

Weary, satisfied with what he 
has found, he leaves his office an 
hour ahead of time. When he re- 
turns to his apartment, Micaela is 
not there. 

T his puzzles him. Always here 
at this hour. The littles left 
alone, playing with their toys. Of 
course it is a bit early, not much. 
Just stepped out for a chat? I don’t 
understand. She hasn’t left a mes- 
sage. He says to his eldest son, 
“Where’s Mommo?” 

“Went out.” 

“Where?” 

A shrug. “Visiting.” 

“How long ago?” 

“An hour. Maybe two.” 

Some help. Fidgety, perturbed, 
Jason calls a couple of women on 
the floor, Micaela’s friends. They 
haven’t seen her. The boy looks up 
and says brightly, “She was going 
to visit a man.” Jason stares 
sharply at him. “A man? Is that 
what she said? What man?” But 
the boy has exhausted his infor- 
mation. Fearful that she has gone 
off for a rendezvous with Michael, 
he debates phoning Edinburgh. 
Just to see if she’s there. A lengthy

inner debate. Furious images rac- 
ing in his skull. Micaela and 
Michael entangled, indistinguish- 
able, united, inflamed. Locked to- 
gether in incestuous passion. As 
perhaps every afternoon. How 
long has this been going on? And 
she comes to me at dinnertime 
every evening hot and wet from 
him. He calls Edinburgh and gets 
Stacion on the screen. Calm, 
bulgy. “Micaela? No, of course 
she isn’t here. Is she supposed to 
be?” 

“I thought maybe — dropping 
in — ” 

“I haven’t heard from her since 
we were at your place.” 

He hesitates. Just as she moves 
to break the connection he blurts, 
“Do you happen to know where 
Michael is right now?” 

“Michael? He’s at work. Inter- 
face Crew Nine.” 

“Are you sure?” 

Stacion looks at him in obvious 
surprise. “Of course I’m sure. 
Where else would he be? His crew 
doesn’t break till seventeen- 
thirty.” Laughs. “You aren’t sug- 
gesting that Michael — that Miche- 
la— ” 

“Of course not. What kind of 
fool do you think I am? I just 
wondered — that perhaps — if — ” 
He is adrift. “Forget it, Stacion. 
Give him my love when he comes 
home.” Jason cuts the contact. 
Head bowed, eyes full of un- 
wanted visions. Michael’s long fin- 
gers encircling his sister’s breasts. 
Rosy nipples poking through. 
Mirror-image faces nose to nose. 
Tonguetips touching. No. Where 
is she, then? He is tempted to try 



to reach him in Interface Crew 
Nine. Find out if Michael really is 
on duty. Or maybe off in some 
dark cubbyhole topping his sister. 
Jason throws himself face down 
on the sleeping platform to con- 
sider his position. He tells himself 
that it is not important that Mi- 
caela is letting her brother top her. 
Not at all. He will not let himself 
be trapped into primeval twenti- 
eth-century attitudes of morality. 
On the other hand, it is a consid- 
erable violation of custom for Mi- 
caela to go off in mid-afternoon 
to be topped. If she wants Mich- 
ael, Jason thinks, let him come 
here decently after midnight, as a 
nightwalker. Instead of this skulk- 
ing and sneaking. Does she think 
I’d be shocked to know who her 
lover is? Does she have to hide it 
from me this way? It’s a hundred 
times as bad to steal away like 
this It introduces a note of deceit. 
Old-fashioned adultery: the secret 
rendezvous. How ugly! I’d like to 
tell her. 

The door opens and Micaela 
comes in. She is naked under a 
translucent flutter-robe and has a 
flushed, rumpled look. She smirks 
at Jason. He perceives the loath- 
ing behind the smirk. 

“Well?” he says. 

“Well?” 

“I was surprised not to find you 
here when I got home.” 

Coolly Micaela disrobes. She 
gets under the cleanser. From the 
way she scrubs herself there can be 
no doubt that she has just been 
topped. After a moment she says, 
“I got back a little late, didn’t I? 
Sorry.”

“Got back from where?” 
“Siegmund Kluver’s.” 

He is astounded and relieved all 
at once. What is this? Daywalk- 
ing? And a woman taking the sex- 
ual initiative? But at least it 
wasn’t Michael. If he can believe 
her. “Siegmund?” he says. “What 
do you mean, Siegmund?” 

“I visited him. Didn’t the littles 
tell you? He had some free time 
today and I went up to his place. 
Quite blessworthy, I must say. An 
expert slotman. Not my first time 
with him but by far the best.” 



She steps out from the cleanser, 
seizes two of the littles, strips 
them, thrusts them under for their 
afternoon bath. Paying almost no 
attention to Jason. He contem- 
plates her lithe bare body in dis- 
may. A lecture on urbmon sexual 
ethics almost spills from him but 
he dams his lips, baffled and agog. 
Having laboriously adjusted him- 
self to accept the unacceptable no- 
tion of her incestuous love, he 
cannot easily come to terms with 
this other business of Siegmund. 
Chasing after him? Daywalking. 



46 



GALAXY 



Daywalking? Has she no shame? 
Why has she done this? Purely for 
spite, he tells himself. To mock 
me. To anger me. To show me 
how little she cares for me. Using 
sex as a weapon against me. 

Flaunting her illicit hour with 
Siegmund. But Siegmund should 
have had more sense. A man with 
his ambitions, violating custom? 
Perhaps Micaela overwhelmed 
him. She can do that. Even to 
Siegmund. The bitch! The bitch! 
He sees her looking at him now, 
eyes sparkling, mouth quirked in 



a hostile smile. Daring him to 
start a fight. Begging him to try 
to make trouble. 

No, Micaela, I won’t play your 
game. 

As she bathes the littles he says 
quite serenely, “What are you 
programing for dinner tonight?”

who decide to exchange mates for 
a night, then find themselves with- 
out the courage to go through 
with it. Jason is wholly drawn into 
the film, enthralled not only by the 
scenes of private houses and open 
countryside but by the sheer alien- 
ness of the characters’ psychology 
— their transparent bravado, their 
intense anguish over a matter as 
trivial as who will poke what into 
whom, their ultimate cowardice. 
It is easier for him to understand 
the nervous hilarity with which 
they experiment with what he 
takes to be cannabis, since the 
film, after all, dates from the 
dawn of the psychedelic era. But 
their sexual attitudes are won- 
drously grotesque. He watches the 
film twice, taking copious notes. 
Why are these people so timid? 
Do they fear an unwanted preg- 
nancy? A social disease? No, the 
time of the film is after the vener- 
eal era, he believes. Is it pleasure 
itself that they fear? Tribal punish- 
ment for violation of the mono- 
polistic concept of twentieth-cen- 
tury marriage? Even if the viola- 
tion is conducted with absolute 
secrecy? That must be it, Jason 
concludes. They dread the laws 
against extramarital intercourse. 
The rack and the thumbscrew, the 
stocks and the ducking-stool, so 
to speak. Hidden eyes watching. 
The shameful truth destined to 
out. So they draw back; so they 
remain locked in the cells of their 
individual marriages. 

Watching their antics he sud- 
denly sees Micaela in the context 
of twentieth-century bourgeois 
morality. Not a timid fool like the 



four people in the film, of course. 
Brazen, defiant — bragging about 
her visit to Siegmund, using sex as 
a way of diminishing her husband. 

A very twentieth-century attitude, 
far removed from the easy accep- 
tance characteristic of the urbmon 
world. Only someone whose view 
of sex is tied to its nature as a , 
commodity could have done what 
Micaela has done. She has rein- 
vented adultery in a society where 
the concept has no meaning! His 
anger rises. Out of 800,000 people 
in Urban Monad 116, why must 
he be married to the one sick one? 

Flirting with her brother be- 
cause she knows it annoys me, not 
because she's really interested in 
him. Going to Siegmund instead 
of waiting for Siegmund to come 
to her. The slotty barbarian! I’ll 
show her, though. I know how to 
play her silly sadistic game! 

At midday he leaves his cubicle, 
having done less than five hours’ 
work. The liftshaft takes him to 
the 787th floor. Outside the apart- 
ment of Siegmund and Mamelon 
Kluver he succumbs to sudden ter- 
rible vertigo and nearly falls. He 
recovers his balance — but fear is 
still great and he is tempted to 
leave. He argues with himself, try- 
ing to purge his timidity. Thinking 
of the people in the motion pic- 
ture. Why is he afraid? Mamelon’s 
just another slot. He’s had a hun- 
dred as attractive as she. But she’s 
clever. 

Might cut me down with a cou- 
ple of quick quips. Still, I want 
her. Denied myself all these years. 
While Micaela blithely marches 
off to Siegmund in the afternoon.

He pushes open the door. 

The Kluver apartment is empty. 
A baby in the maintenance slot, 
no other sign of life. 

“Mamelon?” he asks. Voice al- 
most cracking. 

The screen glows and Mamel- 
on’s pre-programed image ap-

How radiant she is. Smiling. She 
says, “Hello. I have gone to my

gent messages may be relayed to 
me in Shanghai Somatic Fulfill- 
ment Hall or to my husband Sieg- 
mund at Louisville Access Nexus. 
Thank you.” The image fades. 

1500 hours. Nearly a two-hour 
wait. Shall he go? 

He craves another glimpse of 
her loveliness. “Mamelon?” he 
says. 

She reappears on screen. He 
studies her. The aristocratic fea- 
tures, the dark mysterious eyes. 
A self-contained woman, undriven 
by demons. A personality in her 
own right, not, like Micaela, a 
frayed neurotic whipped by the 
psychic winds. “Hello. I have gone 
to my afternoon polyrhythm class 
and will be home at 1500 hours. 
Urgent messages may be re- 
layed — ” 

He waits. 

The apartment, which he has 
seen before, impresses him anew 
with its elegance. Rich textures of 
hangings and draperies, sleek ob- 



jects of art. Marks of status. 
Soon Siegmund will move up to 
Louisville, no doubt and these pri- 
vate possessions are harbingers of 
his coming elevation to the ruling 
caste. To ease his impatience 
Jason toys with the wall-panels, in- 
spects the furniture, programs all 
the scent-apertures. He peers at 
the baby cooing in its maintenance 
slot. He paces. The other Kluver 
child must be two years old by 
now. Will it come home from the 
creche soon? He is not eager to 
entertain a little all afternoon 
while waiting tautly for Mamelon. 



H e tunes the screen and 
watches one of the afternoon 
abstractions. The flow of forms 
and colors carries him through an- 
other impatient hour. Mamelon 
will be here soon. 

1450. She comes in, holding her 
little’s hand. Jason rises, athrob, 
dry-throated. She is dressed sim- 
ply and unglamorously in a cas- 
cading blue tunic, knee-length, and 
gives an unusually disheveled im- 
pression. Why not? She has spent 
the afternoon in physical exercise; 
he cannot expect her to be the im- 
peccable, glistening Mamelon of 
the evenings. 

“Jason? Is something wrong? 
Why—” 

“Just a visit,” he says, barely 
able to recognize his own voice. 

“You look half flippo, Jason! 
Are you ill? Can I get you any- 
thing?” She discards her tunic and 
tosses it, crumpled, under the 
cleanser. Under it she wears only 



THE THROWBACKS

a filmy wrap; he averts his eyes 
from her blazing nudity. And 
stares out of the corners as she 
drops the wrap also, washes and 
dons a light housecoat. Turning to 
him again, she says, “You’re act- 
ing very strangely.” 

Out with it in a rush. 

“Let me top you, Mamelon!” 
A surprised laugh from her. 
“Now? Middle of the afternoon?” 
“Is that so wicked?” 

“It’s unusual,” she says. “Es- 
pecially coming from a man who 
hasn’t ever been to me as a night- 
walker. But I suppose there’s no 
harm in it. All right — come on.” 
As simple as that. She takes off 
the housecoat and inflates the 
sleeping platform. Of course — she 
will not frustrate him, for that 
would be unblessworthy. The hour 
is strange but Mamelon under- 
stands the code by which they live 
and does not hold him strictly to 
the rules. She is his. The white 
skin, the high full breasts. Deepset 
navel. Black matted thatch curling 
lavishly onto her thighs. She beck- 
ons to him from the platform, 
smiles, rubs her knees together to 
ready herself. He removes his 
clothing, carefully folding every- 
thing. He lies down beside her, 
takes one of her breasts nervously 
in his hand, lightly nips her ear- 
lobe. He wants desperately to tell 
her that he loves her. But that 
would be a breach of custom far 
more serious than any he has 
committed thus far. In a sense — 
not the twentieth-century sense — 
she belongs to Siegmund and he 
has no right to intrude his emo- 
tions between them. With a quick 



tense leap he climbs her. As usual, 
panic makes him hurry. 

He gains control of himself and 
slows it down. He dares to open 
his eyes and is gratified to find 
that hers are closed. The nostrils 
flared, the lips drawn back. Such 
perfect white teeth. She seems to 
be purring. He moves a little 
faster. Clasping her in his arms; 
the mounds of her brpasts flatten- 
ing against him. Abruptly, amaz- 
ingly, something extraordinary is 
kindled within her. She shrieks and 
makes hoarse animal noises as she 
claws at him. He is so astonished 
by the fury of her coming that he 
forgets to notice his own. So it 
ends. Exhausted, he clings to her 
a little while after and she strokes 
his sweaty shoulders. Analyzing it 
in the afterward coolness, he real- 
izes that it was not so very differ- 
ent from what he has experienced 
elsewhere. One wilder-than-usual 
moment, perhaps. But otherwise 
only the familiar process. Even 
with Mamelon Kluver, the object 
of his incandescent imaginings for 
three years, it was only the old 
two-backed beast. So much for 
romanticism. In the dark all cats 
are gray: old twentieth-century 
proverb. 

So now I've topped her. 

He withdraws and they go to the 
cleanser together. 

She says, “Better now?” 

“I think so.” 

“You were terribly tight when 
I came in.” 

“I’m sorry,” he says. 

“Can I get you anything?” 

“No.” 

“Would you like to talk?” 



50

“No. No.” He is averting his 
eyes from her body again. He 
searches for his clothing. She does 
not bother to dress. “I guess I’ll 
go,” he says. 

“Come back some time. Per- 
haps during regular nightwalking 
hours. I don’t mean that I really 
mind you coming in the afternoon, 
Jason, but it might be more re- 
laxed at night. Do you follow 
what I’m saying?” 

She is frighteningly casual. 
Does she realize that this is the 
first time he has topped a woman 
of his own city? What if he told 
her that all his other adventures 
had been in Warsaw and Reykja- 
vik and Prague and the other 
grubbo levels? He wonders now 
what he had feared. He will come 
back to her, he is sure. He makes 
his exit amid a flurry of grins, 
nods, half-winks and furtive direct 
glances. Mamelon blows him a 
kiss. 



I N THE corridor. Still early af- 
ternoon. The whole point of this 
excursion will be lost if he comes 
home on time. He takes the 
dropshaft to his office and con- 
sumes two futile hours there. 
Even so, too early. Returning to 
Shanghai a little past 1800, he en- 
ters the somatic fulfillment hall 
and dumps himself into an image- 
bath. The warm undulating cur- 
rents are soothing but he responds 
badly to the psychedelic vibrations 
from below and his mind fills with 
visions of shattered, blackened 
urbmons, all girders and skewed 
concrete. When he comes up it is 



1920 and the screen in the dressing 
room, picking up his emanations, 
says, “Jason Quevedo, your wife 
is trying to trace you.” Fine. Late 
for dinner. Let her squirm. He 
nods to the screen and goes out. 
After walking the halls for close 
to an hour, beginning at the 770th 
floor and snaking his way up to 
792, he drops to his own level and 
heads for home. 

A screen in the hall outside the 
shaft tells him again that tracers 
are out for him. 

“I’m coming. I’m coming,” he 
mutters, irritated. 

Micaela looks rewardingly wor- 
ried. “Where have you been?” she 
asks, the instant he appears. 

“Oh, around. Around.” 

“You weren’t working late. I 
called you there. I had tracers on 
you.” 

“As if I were a lost boy.” 

“It wasn’t like you. You don’t 
just disappear in the middle of the 
afternoon.” 

“Have you had dinner yet?” 

“I’ve been waiting,” she says 
sourly. 

“Let’s eat, then. I’m starved.” 

“You won’t explain?” 

“Later.” Working hard at an 
air of mystery. 

He scarcely notices his food. 
Afterward he spends the usual 
time with the littles. They go off 
to sleep. He rehearses what he will 
say to Micaela, arranging the 
words in various patterns. He tries 
inwardly to practice a self-satisfied 
smirk. For once he will be the ag- 
gressor. For once he will hurt her. 

She has become absorbed in the 
screen transmission. Her earlier 



THE THROWBACKS

anxiety about his disappearance 
seems to have vanished. Finally he 
is forced to say, “Do you want to 
discuss what I did today?” 

She looks up. “What you did? 
Oh, you mean this afternoon?” 
She no longer cares, it appears. 
“Well?” 

“I went to Mamelon Kluver.” 
“Day walking? You?” 

“Me.” 

“Was she good?” 

“She was superb,” he says, puz- 
zled by Micaela’s air of uncon- 
cern. “She was everything I imag- 
ined she’d be.” 

Micaela laughs. 

“Is it funny?” he asks. 

“It isn’t. You are.” 

“Tell me what you mean by 
that.” 

“All these years you deny your- 
self nightwalkihg in Shanghai and 
go off to the grubbos. Now, for 
the stupidest possible reason, you 
finally allow yourself Mame- 
lon — ” 

“You knew I never night walked 
here?” 

“Of course I knew,” she says. 
“Women talk. 1 ask my friends. 
You never topped any of them. So 
I started to wonder. 1 had some 
checking done on you. Warsaw. 
Prague. Why did you have to go 
down there Jason?” 

“That doesn’t matter now.” 
“What does?” 

“That I spent the afternoon on 
Mamelon’s sleeping platform.” 
Silence. 

“You idiot.” 

“Bitch.” 

“Failure.” 

“Sterilizer!” 



“Grubbo!” 

“Wait,” he says. “Wait. Why 
did you go to Siegmund?” 

“To annoy you,” she admits. 
“Because he’s a rung-grabber and 
you aren’t. I wanted to get you 
excited. To make you move.” 

“So you violated all custom 
and aggressively daywalked with 
the man of your choice. Not 
pretty, Micaela. Not at all femi- 
nine, I might add.” 

“That keeps things even, then. 
A female husband and a mannish 
wife.” 

“You’re quick with the insults, 
aren’t you?” 

“Why did you go to Mame- 
lon?” 

“To get you angry. To pay you 
back for Siegmund. Not that I 
give a damn about your letting 
him top you. We can take that 
stuff for granted, I think. But 
your motives. Using sex as a wea- 
pon. Deliberately playing the 
wrong role. Trying to stir me up. 
It was ugly, Micaela.” 

“And your motives? Sex as re- 
venge? Nightwalking is supposed 
to reduce tensions, not to create 
them. Regardless of the time of 
day you do it. You want Mame- 
lon, fine — she’s a lovely girl. But 
to come here and brag about it, 
as if you think I care whose — ” 
“Don’t be a filther, Micaela.” 
“Listen to him! Listen to him! 
Puritan! Moralist!” 

They shout. 

The littles begin to cry. They 
have never heard shouting before. 
Micaela makes a hushing gesture 
at them behind her back. 

“At least 1 have morals,” he 



52

says. “What about you and your 
brother Michael?” 

“What about us?” 

“Do you deny you’ve let him 
top you?” 

“When we were kids, yes, a 
couple of times,” she says, flush- 
ing. “So? You never touched your 
sisters, I suppose.” 

“Not only when you were kids. 
You’re still making it with him.” 
“I think you’re insane, Jason.” 
“You deny it?” 

“Michael hasn’t touched me in 
ten years. Not that 1 see anything 
wrong with his doing it, except 
that it hasn’t happened. Oh, Jason, 
Jason, Jason! You’ve spent so 
much time mucking around in 
your archives that you’ve turned 
yourself into a twentieth-century 
man. You’re jealous, Jason. Wor- 
ried about incest, no less. And 
whether 1 obey the rules about fe- 
male initiative. What about you 
and your Warsaw nightwalking? 
Don’t we have a propinquity cus- 
tom? Are you imposing a double 
standard, Jason? You do what you 
like and I observe custom? And 
upset about Siegmund. Michael. 
You’re jealous, Jason. Jealous. 
We abolished jealousy a hundred 
and fifty years ago!” 

“And you’re a social climber. 
A would-be slicko. You aren’t 
satisfied with Shanghai, you want 
Louisville. Well, ambition is ob- 
solete, too, Micaela. Besides, you 
were the one who started this 
whole business of using sex to 
score debating points. By going to 
Siegmund and making sure 1 knew 
it. You think I’m a puritan? 
You’re a throwback, Micaela. 



You’re full of pre-urbmon moral- 
ity.” 

“If I am, I got that way from 
you,” she cries. 

“No. I got that way from you. 
You carry the poison around in 
you. When you — ” 

The door opens. A man looks 
in. Charles Mattern, from 799. The 
sleek, fast-talking sociocomputa- 
tor; Jason has worked with him on 
several research projects. Evi- 
dently he has overheard the un- 
blessworthy furor going on in 
here, for he is frowning in embar- 
rassment. “God bless,” he says 
softly, “I’m just out nightwalking 
and I thought I’d — ” 

“No,” Micaela screams. “Not 
now! Go away!” 

Mattern shows his shock. He 
starts to say something, then 
shakes his head and ducks out of 
the room, muttering an apology 
for his intrusion. 

Jason is appalled. To turn away 
a legitimate nightwalker? To order 
him out of the room? 

“Savage!” he cries, and slaps 
her across the face. “How could 
you have done that?” 

She recoils, rubbing her cheek. 
“Savage? Me? And you hitting? 
I could have you thrown down the 
chute for — ” 

“I could have you thrown down 
the chute for — ” 

He stops. They both are silent. 



Y OU shouldn’t have sent Mat- 
tern away,” he says quietly, a 
little later. 

“You shouldn’t have hit me.” 
“I was worked up. Some rules

just musn’t be broken. If he re- 
ports you — ” 

“He won’t. He could see we 
were having an argument. That I 
wasn’t exactly available to him 
right then.” 

“Even having an argument,” he 
says. “Screaming like that. Both 
of us. At the very least it could 
get us sent to the moral engi- 
neers.” 

“I’ll fix things with Mattern, Ja- 
son. Leave it to me. I’ll get him 
back here and explain and I’ll give 
him the topping of his life.” She 
laughs gently. “You dumb 
flippo.” There is affection in her 
voice. “We probably sterilized half 
the floor with our screeching. 
What was the sense, Jason?” 

“I was trying to make you un- 
derstand something about your- 
self. Your essentially archaic psy- 
chological makeup, Micaela. If 
you could only see yourself ob- 
jectively, the pettiness of a lot of 
your motivations lately — I don’t 
want to start another fight. I’m 
just trying to explain things 
now — ” 

“And your motivations, Jason? 
You’re just as archaic as I am. 
We’re both throwbacks. Our 
heads are both full of primitive 
moralistic reflexes. Isn’t that so? 
Can’t you see it?” 

Of course. 

He walks away from her. 
Standing with his back to her, he 
fingers the rubbing-node set into 
the wall near the cleanser and lets 
some of the tensions flow from 
him into it. “Yes,” he says after 
a long while. “Yes, I see it. We 
have a veneer of urbmonism. But 



underneath — jealousy, envy, pos- 
sessiveness — ” 

“Yes. Yes.” 

“And you see what this does to 
my work, of course?” He man- 
ages a chuckle. “My thesis that 
selective breeding has produced a 
new species of human in the urb- 
mons? Maybe so, but I don’t be- 
long to the species. You don’t be- 
long. Maybe they do, some of 
them. But how many? How many, 
really?” 

His mind continues to echo the 
question. 

She comes up behind him and 
leans close. He feels her nipples 
against his back. Hard, tickling 
him. “Most of them, perhaps,” 
she says. “Your thesis may still 
be right. But we’re wrong. We’re 
out of place.” 

“Yes.” 

“Throwbacks to an uglier age.” 

“Yes.” 

“So we’ve got to stop torturing 
each other, Jason. We have to 
wear better camouflage. Do you 
see?” 

“Yes. Otherwise we’ll end up go- 
ing down the chute. We’re un- 
blessworthy, Micaela.” 

“Both of us.” 

“Both of us.” 

He turns. His arms surround 
her. He winks. She winks. 

“Vengeful barbarian,” she says 
tenderly. 

“Spiteful savage,” he whispers, 
kissing her earlobe. 

They slip together onto the 
sleeping platform. The nightwalk- 
ers will simply have to wait. 

He has never loved her as much 
as he does this minute. ★

containers for the 
condition of man 

FACT FEATURE by LAURI VIRTA

“The most practical man on Earth 
and the wealthiest on top of that 
finds himself in the most extrava- 
gant and irrational position. The 
American metropolitan man is just 
plain silly and he’s becoming aware 
ofit. 

The Architectural Vision of Pa- 
olo Saleri — Corcoran Gallery of 
Art, Washington, D.C. 

T he condition of Man these days 
is often described as barely so- 
so. God is dead and the cities are 
sagging. There are too many of 
thee and scarcely enough of me 
and too often thee won’t listen. 
Air, water and Earth are polluted 
and few of us, from top to bottom, 
show any great inclination to stop 
chewing each other’s jugulars for 
reasons ranging from pot to patri- 
otism. Few things work and peo- 
ple don’t want to. It was about 
time for something to happen in 
New Jersey. 



Man’s current condition is prob- 
ably as well exemplified in New 
Jersey as anywhere. The state is 
the most densely populated in the 
Union and economically among 
the most urbanized. Agriculture 
accounts for less than one per cent 
of its work force distribution; 
manufacture, trade, services and 
government — in that order — use 
up 84.2% of the remaining payroll. 
Spread out evenly over its land 
area nearly a thousand New Jer- 
seyites might homestead each 
square mite of the state — delete 
lakes and waterways, roads and 
other transportation facilities, 
manufacturing and business sites, 
waste depots and other unusable 
areas and conditions for life be- 
come much more crowded. 

Then try to shoehorn a badly 
needed modern jet airport right in- 
to where all the action is — that’s 
where jetports are needed — and 
you have a problem. Perhaps even 



55 




a sudden life-and-death problem. 

The photographs on the follow- 
ing pages treat it as such. The de- 
signer of the scale-model struc- 
tures depicted, Arizona-based Ar- 
chitect Paolo Soleri, calls them ar- 
cologies, a name derived from 
combining architecture and ecolo- 
gy- 

“When we cry for the raped 
Earth,” says Soleri, “we cry for 
the narrowing lead we have on 
death.” 

Soleri’s view of the future, how- 
ever, is audacious rather than tear- 
ful. Man must be contained — but 
not imprisoned. His conditions of 
survival have grown increasingly 
complex — until their byproducts 
threaten that very survival. Soleri’s 
arcologies are also defined as 
“containers for the condition of 
man — ” italics ours — and include 
all of modern man’s life-support 
artifacts and, hopefully, their evo- 
lutionary potential. 

The first two photos show a 
three-dimensional model “contain- 
er” titled 3-D Jersey, recently ex- 
hibited at the Corcoran Gallery of 
Art in Washington, D.C., under 
the joint sponsorship of the De- 
partment of Housing and Urban 
Development and the Prudential 
Insurance Company. It is a single- 
structure city, an integrated urban 
complex more than a mile in diam- 
eter and a half-mile high — twice- 
plus the height of the Empire State 
Building — designed to house, em- 
ploy and completely service the 



economic, health, educational, cul- 
tural, physical and domestic needs 
of a million or more residents. 
With fresh air, sunlight and recre- 
ational facilities thrown in. 

The concept grew out of New 
Jersey’s need for a new, major air- 
port and is the result of a study in 
depth which originally involved the 
State Planning Commission as 
overall coordinator of state plan- 
ning, the Ford Motor Company as 
transportation consultant, Rutgers 
University as supplier of sociologi- 
cal input — and Paolo Soleri as de- 
signer. 

The bio'nomic function of 3-D 
Jersey is that of a massive trans- 
portation center — air traffic is its 
supporting industry. In the design 
shown (photo, p. 56) the airfield — 
hinted at only fractionally at upper 
left and top — completely sur- 
rounds the city. Traffic from all 
points of the compass would reach 
the city without noisy and pollut- 
ing overflights. Aircraft would 
touch down two to two and a half 
miles from the center of the city, 
taxi underground into the huge, en- 
circling outer ring (shown partially 
at left and across the top of the 
photo). The ring houses terminals, 
freight and passenger areas, han- 
gars and repair shops. 

Traffic departures reverse the 
process. Takeoffs or liftoffs would 
again take place well away from 
the heart of the city. A small heli- 
port — usable also by vertical-take- 
off craft — perches atop an elevator

The pyramids are gigantic plat-

variety of buildings may be con- 
structed. Again the outer surfaces 
of the arcology are designed for 
housing, gardens, playgrounds and 
neighborhoods and afford maxi-

Hexahedron is also admirably 
designed, according to Mr. Walk- 
er, for recycling its own wastes and 
sewage to produce — for instance — 
electric power. 

Collection is easy. “You’re not 
dealing with laid-out, flat, horizon- 
tal systems and the possibilities of 
reusing the stuff are almost end- 
less.” 

N one of Mr. Soleri’s giant ar- 
cologies has as yet attained 
structural reality, although his vi- 
sionary designs have exploded dra- 
matically on the speculative scene. 
Nor will they begin to house hu- 
mans until many socio-economic 
and political attitudes change dras- 
tically. Exactly what changes are 
required will be tested, starting this 
year, in central Arizona. 
Groundwork for the construc- 



tion of the first modest arcology, 
Arcosanti, is scheduled to begin 
early this summer. Strictly an ex- 
perimental project, Arcosanti (see 
photo on page 63) is designed to 
house from 2,500 to 3,000 people 
on ten acres of land situated in a 
wilderness preserve of 4,000 acres. 

Again quoting Mr. Walker: 
“The idea is, we’re trying to test 
the concept of putting a city or 
town or whatever — a, complete ur- 
ban environment — in a large, open 
park or preserve. It will allow peo- 
ple the option of having a city en- 
vironment or raw nature.” 

The test is an important one — 
Mr. Soleri and his apprentices be- 
lieve in an urban environment for 
Man. The rest of the 4,000 acres 
will be devoted to farming, recre- 
ation parks or just plain wilderness 
to increase the options. It is hoped 
that the project will invite as par- 
ticipants professional people — ar- 
chitects, engineers, economists and 
the like — who will be able to de- 
fine new urban situations and build 
or design to meet them. Except for 
the container shown here, the pur- 
pose is to make Arcosanti a self- 
building city. 

A kind of inevitability underlies 
many — if not most — of Paolo Sal- 
eri’s concepts. “Miniaturization” 
is a key word that frequently and 
basically crops up in connection 
with his massive arcologies, which 
are basically conceived as social 
organisms following biological 
laws.

“As any organism evolves,” Mr. 
Walker quotes his mentor, “as it 
has more options — the structure in 
which it operates seems to im- 
plode.” 

The arcologies are not designed 
to expand physically. 

“They’re organized in the sense 
that, say, the human body is orga- 
nized. It’s very difficult for the hu- 
man body to add another finger or 
to add another heart — this takes 
millions of years of evolution. 
These cities might be considered to 
be designed in such a way that 
their bones and nervous systems 
are defined. Then the skin and 
mind can go through almost infi- 
nite change, as in a human being. 
We’re all organized in the same 
physical pattern but each of us is a 
separate individual, depending on 
how our senses and sensibilities de- 
velop. The concept can be applied 
to this organism called the city.” 

Perhaps the sense of inevitability 
one has about Mr. Soleri’s arcolo- 
gies derives from the fact they in- 
clude containers for virtually every 
condition in which technological 
Man has found himself. Asteromo 
is a city in orbit — an asteroid de- 
signed to house indefinitely, under 
simulated Earth conditions, a pop- 
ulation of about 70,000 people. “It 
is a double-skinned cylinder kept 
inflated by pressurization and rota- 
tion on its main axis. The inner 
skin is the ground on which man 
walks. It is lined with vegetation 
for food and the carbon dioxide- 



oxygen cycle . .” Mr. Soleri 
writes in his book. The City in the 
Image of Man, recently published 
byM.I.T. 

Then there are Novanoah I and 
Novanoah II for humans whose 
condition — by preference — is 

linked to the ocean. The first of 
these rises to a height of 1,000 me- 
ters — nicely more than a half-mile 
— above the surface of the ocean 
in which it floats on a wheel-like 
base of 6,800 acres. Mechanical fa- 
cilities, industries, life-support sys- 
tems, sea-farms and submarine 
harbors are designed below water 
level; housing, cultural, business 
and administrative centers above. 

Novanoah II is a seagoing giant, 
based on a floating platform three 
miles across and reaching up to a 
mile in height. Its population is es- 
timated at 2,400,000 and distribu- 
tion of facilities is about the same 
as in Novanoah I. 

Many of Mr. Soleri’s “contain- 
ers” are not only sociologically 
and spiritually but also technologi- 
cally beyond the current condition 
of Man. We still lack know-how — 
some of Mr. Soleri’s most massive 
urban organisms are intended to be 
fusion-powered — like having a lit- 
tle sun in your basement. Mr. Sol- 
eri does not present them as ulti- 
mate answers to Man’s condition. 

They are simply to indicate a 
possible direction.

J IM Hailey had to look all 
through the house before he 
found his wife. She was soaking in 
the tub; her clothes lay strewn 
across the bathroom floor. “Say, 
Mona, what’s all that meat on the 
front porch?” he said, frowning. 
“Looks like hell.” 

She burst into tears. “That’s 
not meat, that’s Amanda Jean.” 
“You must be kidding,” ex- 
claimed Jim. “Is this some damn 
fool joke?” 

“Joke!” She started to laugh. 
Jim could see she was close to 
hysteria; he got her out of the tub 
and into bed and brought her a 
drink of brandy. 

“Now, tell me all about it,” he 
said calmly, although he was very 
upset himself. Amanda Jean was 
his favorite daughter. 

She took a deep, shuddering 
breath. “We were walking from 
the bus stop, along Elm. I met her 
downtown and we took the bus 
home together. And this. big 
station wagon draws up alongside, 
this fellow. leans out with his 
. gun—” 

“What kind of gun?” 

“You know I don’t know one 
from the other!” 

“Long barrel or — Never mind. 
What happened then?” 

“He missed. I gave her a push. 
We started running. She was out 
ahead, she’s so fast. Was so fast. 
I was trying to. .get in the way, 
you know?” 

Jim touched her hand. 



“I know.” 

“We got to the cedar hedge. So 
then I knew if we once got across 
the Hursts’ lawn we could duck 
back of the big willow into the pa- 
tio and be — ” her mouth had to 
work to form the word — “safe. 
And I thought, Jim was right tO; 
put the willow there. .” 

His hand twitched on hers. “But 
as soon as we reached the lawn she 
. .went down. I tripped on her 
and I. .” 

Jim waited, stroking her arm. 
“There, there. You did everything 
you could.” But his mind was not 
with her; his mind was out in the 
street, hearing the shot, seeing 
Amanda Jean fall, inventing a face 
for the man who shot her and try- 
ing to memorize the invented face, 
as though it were real; just to be 
doing something, anything. 

“I crawled over, kind of laid 
across her. He said, ‘Please look 
out.’ I knew it was no use, but I just 
lay there, screaming, the way you 
do. So he pushed me aside. .” 
“You got off easy.” 

”. .and put another. .shot in 
her neck.” 

“Not her head.” 

“Of course not! The head was 
what he wanted] I knew we should 
have cut her hair. I told you, re- 
member? I said — ” 

“Go on, damn you!” he snarled. 
She set up a wail. 

“Oh, I’m sorry, Mona honey. 
Only when I feel so bad and then 
you say it’s my fault — ”

T hey dung to each other. She 
was shaking. “It was a rifle. I 
can see the long barrel. .” 

“What did he look like? What 
kind of a looking fellow?” 

“Why, do you know what he 
looks like. You know Lister Will- 
ings, from up the hill. That big 
house on Cerrito?” 

“By sight. Not to speak to. Go 
on.” 

“Well, he carried her up on the 
porch and asked could I let him 
have a bucket of water and some 
newspaper. So I did and he cleaned 
it all up. Nice and neat, didn’t you 
think?” 

“Neat enough,” he said. Her 
voice was fading and he needed a 
few more facts before she got to 
the end of her strength. “What did 
he take?” 

“Well, the head, of course, and 
the patches. In this plastic carrying 
case? Then he asked did I want him 
to quarter the rest, and I. .said 
yes. I didn’t know what to say, and 
you weren’t here. .he would have 
carried them inside but I said no, I 
didn’t want him in my house. So 
he took his case and his knives and 
left.” 

“And nobody came to give you 
a hand? None of the neighbors?” 
“Louise Hurst came over, soon 
as he left. Then Mrs. Atterman. 
Helped me in, left a message for 
you at the office and all — but I 
sent them home, they have their 
dinner to fix. Jack Hurst’ll be by 
when he sees your car. There’s a 



new bottle of bourbon in the cup- 
board, underneath.” 

“Well, I’ll be gone for a while.” 
He found the sleeping pills and 
gave her two with a drink of wa- 
ter. “Just lie quiet and you’ll drop 
off. I’ll leave a note for the kids.” 
She brought his hand to her lips 
and lay back, eyes closed. He went 
downstairs and wrote the note, 
taping it to the refrigerator door 
so they would surely see it.

He spread a plastic dropcloth on 
the back seat of his car, piled 
Amanda Jean’s quarters on it and 
drove down to the police station. 
But he could have saved himself 
the trouble. “Hell, Jim,” said Cap- 
tain Morck, “I feel really bad 
about this but you know it’s the 
season. Here’s a man got his per- 
mit and his license, she was fifteen 
years of age, not a darn thing in 
the world I can do.” 

“Shooting out of his station 
wagon?” cried Jim. 

“Who says?” 

“My wife was right there.” 

Dave Morck grabbed irritably 
at a fly. “It’s up to you, Jim. You 
can bring a charge against him, get 
your wife up on the stand and put 
her through this awful experience 
all over again — and who’s going to

believe the girl’s mother? And 
what’s to stop him putting on a 
witness’ll swear he was on foot?” 
Jim knew Dave was talking 
sense but it made him wild. 
“Aren’t you supposed to enforce 
the law? Didn’t you take some 
kind of oath of office?” 

“It’s your wife,” said Dave 
Morck.. “You really want to put 
her through that, go ahead. And 
then what? Maybe he gets two 
years, out in ten months — that 
going to bring back your girl?” 
“No.” He slapped the desk, 
stood up slowly. 

“Take it easy.” 

“Yeah.” He walked out, mak- 
ing a brief gesture of greeting to 
Breierman and Foley. When he 
opened his car door he saw the 
flies on Amanda Jean and beat 
them off, swearing. 



H e drove up to the Willings 
place, through the gates and 
around to the front, or what he 
took to be the front, since it was 
where the driveway went. It was a 
real modern house. He walked up 
to the door and rang, looking the 
place over out of habit; sixty thou- 
sand in the house, ten for the lot, 
another ten for the tennis court 
and pool and some kind of barbe- 
cue out back — he could smell the 
charcoal. 

The door opened. A heavy-set 
man in a flowered sport shirt said, 
“Yes?” 



“Willings? I’m Jim Hailey, 
down on Juanita and Elm.” 

“Oh!” said Willings. “That was 
your daughter?” He stood back. 
“Come on in.” 

It was a good-sized room, fire- 
place, ceramic tile floor. “What 
do you drink?” > 

“Not now, thanks.” 

“Sit down anyhow.” Willings 
indicated a big leather chair. 

“Can’t stay. I’ve got her quar- 
ters out in the car. How come you 
left them? I smelled barbecue just 
now — you’re not vegetarian. 
Didn’t think she’d eat good?” 

“Oh, sure, but I hoped you 
could use them. My freezer’s full, 
been pretty lucky this year. Say, 
actually, you like something suc- 
culent? Remember last fall, they 
opened up the pre-schoolers down 
in San Felipe? I’ve still got a few 
chops, little boy about three and a 
half, cuts like butter.” 

“I have everything I need,” said 
Jim. “But I’d surely appreciate it 
if you could spare Amanda Jean’s 
trophies.” 

Willings clucked, frowning. 
“No can do. They’re at Hamil- 
ton’s already. I’ll have him ship 
them over to you when they’re 
mounted. He’s putting them on a 
slab of Honduras mahogany, 
you’ll have something really nice.” 
He put up one hand. “My plea- 
sure, don’t mention it.” 

“I wasn’t about to, you dirty 
bastard. Sweet talking me, but I 
know you got her with a rolling

shot. Real rodeo rifle, aren’t you, 
Willings?” 

Willings flushed. “I’m afraid 
you’ve been misinformed, Mr. 
Hailey. I wouldn’t do a thing like 
that.” 

“But you would call my wife a 
liar,” Jim said gently. 

“Look here, Hailey — ” began 
Willings. “I invited you into my 
home, offered you a drink — ” 

“And a pound of kindergarten 
cutlets and a piece of Honduras 
mahogany. You must figure I’m 
looking to be paid for my own 
daughter.” Willings opened his 
mouth but Jim cut him off. “You 
might as well fix me that drink.” 

Willings turned to the bar. Jim 
looked around till he found the 
door to the kitchen. The wife was 
shredding cabbage. “Beg pardon. 
Ma’am. Could I trouble you to 
step in here?” 

She put down her knife and 
came in, looking from him to 
Willings. Willings reached toward 
his gun rack but Jim got him first. 
He fell back across the bar with a 
crash of breaking glass and slid 
tinkling to the floor. 

J IM lowered the wife — widow — 
gently into a chair. “You saw it. 
Ma’am. You saw it was a legal 
kill.” 

She nodded. 

When he brought back the vac- 
uum she was still nodding. He 
slapped her sharply to bring her 
out of it — but then he was sorry he 



did, because all the time he was 
scalping Willings she made a real 
nuisance of herself. 

“I know how you feel, ma’am,” 
he said finally, “but I don’t have 
all day. Got to get home, look af- 
ter my kids.” He got her back in 
the chair. “You ought to have 
somebody up here with you. You 
want me to call your people?” 

He meant to do this right. 

“No, I wijl,” she said. He 
brought her the phone and she 
turned her head away and began 
talking in a low voice. When he 
was finished he went around and 
caught her eye, pointing to the 
quarters, but she shook her head, 
so he carried them out and 
dropped them in the back with 
Amanda Jean. He considered leav- 
ing his card in case she decided to 
sell — but then he figured to pass 
on the tip to Hank Schloss. He 
didn’t want anything that would 
remind him of this day, not even a 
commission. 

When he got home Mona was 
still asleep. The kids had fixed din- 
ner and tidied up. They were good 
kids. He called Billy away from 
TV to help with the wrapping and 
freezing but after a few minutes he 
let him go — the poor kid’s eyes 
filled with tears every time he 
looked at his sister’s slender quar- 
ters. 

Then he had a sandwich and a 
glass of beer and went to bed, al- 
though he did not fall asleep for 
the longest time. 



GOODBYE AMANDA JEAN

N ext day he notified the school 
and the insurance company. 
Mona and the kids went through 
Amanda Jean’s clothes and divided 
up her records and trinkets. It 
looked to Jim as if they were tak- 
ing shifts crying — as soon as one 
dried up another started. 

Then he thought he would just 
get past it, the way he did after 
Duane was shot — but maybe he 
was more attached to Amanda 
Jean than to Duane. Or maybe it 
was because he and Mona were 
older now, not likely to have any 
more kids. It was over and done 
with — her trophies were up over 
the mantel, Willings’ scalp was 
cured and hung on the knotty pine 
scalp rack in the office; still he 
would be showing a property and 
his mind would go slipping away 
to the Willings house, with the 
crash of glass, the smell of blood 
and whiskey, the feel of Willings’ 
bald spot under his fingers during 
the scalping. 

And still he kept seeing her out 
of the corner of his eye. But it was 
always one of the other girls. 



TIE WASN’T eating right or 
sleeping right. Mona kept after 
him but he didn’t want to talk 
about it — it made him feel like a 
fool. Then one morning as he was 
leaving for the office she said, 
“Honey, I made a date for you to 
see Dr. Peabody.’’ 

He just stood and stared at her 



and she got flustered. “Well, not 
really a date. He said he’d be 
working on his sermon this after- 
noon if you wanted to drop by. 
But I can call and break it — ’’ 

He picked up his jacket. “Seems 
as if you did enough talking about 
me already. I’ll call.” / 

And he meant to. But as the 
morning wore on he got to won- 
dering what Dr. Peabody would 
say when he heard the whole story 
— and after lunch Jim stopped by 
to tell it to him. 

Dr. Peabody didn’t say a thing, 
just took off his glasses, turned 
them around and stared at them as 
if they were someone else’s eyes. 
Jim sat forward. “Now, wasn’t 
that wrong. Dr. Peabody? A per- 
son might close their eyes to the 
illegal shot, if it was a fellow 
needed food. But to drive off and 
leave her, all but the trophies — 
don’t you say it was wrong?” 

Dr. Peabody’s uncovered eyes 
looked large and soft. “Of course 
there’s a line between right and 
wrong. But it isn’t straight and 
sharp, like a property line. It 
doesn’t even stand still. It’s more 
like the wet line that runs down the 
beach after a wave breaks. Ever 
watch? Then there’s another wave 
and another wet line. Was it higher 
or lower this time? Is the tide 
coming in or going out?” Jim 
wasn’t sure what Dr. Peabody was 
getting at, but he nodded politely. 
“Take your kill, Jim. Of Mr. 
Willings. Was that right?”

“It was a one hundred per cent 
legal kill,” said Jim. “Over and 
above that, it was to Mphold the 
law. If more people would get out 
and do like I did, we could get the 
guns out of the cars and give our 
girls a sporting chance.” 

“I didn’t ask if it was legal. I 
asked if it was right.” 

“It surely was!” 

“Would you be here if you real- 



ly believed that?” said Dr. Pea- 
body quietly. 

“What?” said Jim. He felt con- 
fused. 

Dr. Peabody put his glasses on 
again — now his eyes were smaller, 
farther away. 

“Jim. You killed in anger — did 
you not?” 

“I never!” cried Jim. “1 was 
cool as a butcher.”

“Ah?” said Dr. Peabody. “Well, 
then, I must be mistaken. I sup- 
pose you’ve eaten him.” 

Jim looked at Dr. Peabody’s 
chin. “I don’t know. Maybe. Mo- 
na handles all that.” 

“Did you eat him, Jim?” 

“No, sir,” he muttered. 

“Why not?” 

Jim looked away, up one wall of 
Dr. Peabody’s study and down the 
other. “Why not, Jim?” 

Jim looked down at his hands. 
“Then, of course, you had no 
right to take his life. And you 
know it, don’t you? In your heart. 
Don’t you, Jim?” 

All of a sudden he felt some- 
thing snapping inside his chest, as 
if a great big rubber band had been 
holding him together. He walked 
to the door, tried to speak — and 
just went on out. He drove over to 
the far side of the golf course and 
sat in his car crying for about half 
an hour. 

Then he went home and made 
himself a drink and began taking 
quarters out of the freezer. 

“Call the gang,” he told Mona. 
“Barbecue tomorrow.” 

Mona looked at him and kept 
her mouth shut. She was a really 
good wife. 

N ext morning early he started 
the fire and trimmed out the 
meat. Then he mixed up his own 
special sauce and began basting. 
He used a child’s toy broom that 
he kept for barbecues. Once or 



twice he had a call from the office 
but mostly he just stood around 
painting on sauce and fussing with 
the fire. 

That night Hank Schloss said it 
was the best he ever ate. “Only I 
wish I had a few days notice, so’s 
I could have worked up a real ap- 
petite! What came over you all qf 
a sudden?” 

“Why, Hank, you ought to 
know,” said Jim, “there’s three 
things a man don’t like to hang 
around and wait for, once he gets 
the notion — and two of them’s 
barbecue!” They all laughed. 

But in fact he ate very little. 
And even so he was up most of the 
night, puking. 

But next morning when he came 
downstairs he felt it was going to 
be all right. He stopped at the 
stove and laid his cheek against 
Mona’s and she reached around 
and patted his shoulder with the 
oven mitt. 

On his way to the office he 
stopped at the Peabody’s and 
dropped off two fine rib roasts out 
of his freezer. 

“Your very own girl!” ex- 
claimed Mrs. Peabody. .“I am 
touched! And what joy to have 
something tender, for a change!” 
She clapped her hand over her 
mouth. “Aren’t I awful, talking 
like this? When people are so kind 
and generous about sharing with 
us? But you know, it generally 
turns out to be somebody’s old 
aunt, for braising.” ★

T his is an attempt to assemble 
such facts (hard and soft) as 
may yet be found about a remark- 
able man who seemed to be abso- 
lutely balanced and integrated, yet 
who developed a schizo-gash deep 
as a canyon right down the middle 
of his person. Dr. George Drakos 
says that he developed three or 
four such schizo-gashes. 

This is also an attempt to re- 
cord some of the strange goings- 
on in the house on Harrow Street 
— and it is a half-hearted (no, a 
faint-hearted or downhearted) at- 
tempt to record the looser goings- 
on in the subsequently forever 
house on Harrow Street. The sub- 
ject is a man who had everything, 
took hold of something beyond 
that and was broken to pieces by 
it. Or was not. 

“1 want to be the complete 
man,” John Penandrew used to 
say to himself. “1 want to be the 
complete man,” he would say to 
all of us who would hear him. 
Well, he was already the most 
complete man that any of us had 
ever seen. He had been a promis- 
ing young man: as Don Marquis 
has said of himself, and had been a 
promising young man for twenty 
years. But Penandrew didn’t show 
those twenty years at all, except in 
his depth. 

His eyes, his shape, his every- 
thing was just as all had been when 
he left Monica Hall twenty years 
before: he had been a gilded youth 
then — or at least he had been 



plated over with a very shiny sub- 
stance. He still was, he was still 
that youth, but in his depth he was 
a full man, sure and mature, and 
with the several appearances to- 
gether and unconflicting. For he 
was also the boy he had been thirty 
years before, in no detail changed. 
He had been a loud-mouthed kid, 
but smart all the time and smooth 
when he wanted to be. Now there 
was a boy, a youth and a man, 
three non-contradictory stages of 
him looking out of his gray eyes. 
His complexity impressed me 
strongly. And it also impressed 
four men who were not as easily 
impressed as I was. 

There were five men who knew 
everything; and there was myself. 
We met loosely two or three times 
a year. The five men who knew 
everything were this John Penan- 
drew (he was in banks as his father 
had been); Dr. George Drakos, 
who was Greek and who used to 
go to Greek school in the even- 
ings; Harry O’Donovan, who was 
a politician as his fathers had been 
forever; Cris Benedetti, an ex-sem- 
inarian who taught literature and 
esoterica at the university; and 
Barnaby Sheen, who was owner of 
the Oklahoma Seismograph En- 
terprizes. 

These five men were all rich, 
and they all knew everything. I 
wasn’t and I didn’t. I belonged to 
the loose group by accident: they 
had never noticed that I alone had 
not become rich or that there were

We had all gone to school twen- 
ty years before to the Augustini- 
ans at Monica Hall and minds 
once formed by the Augustinians 
are Augustinian forever. We had 
learned to latch onto every sound 
idea and intuition and to hold on 
forever. At least we had more 
scope than those who went to 
school to the Jesuits or the Do- 
minicans. This information is all 
pertinent. Without the Augustini- 
an formation John Penandrew 
would never have shattered — he’d 
have bent. 

I ’VE decided not to die in the 
natural course of things,” John 
Penandrew said softly. The other 
four of those men who knew ev- 
erything didn’t seem at all sur- 
prised. 

“You’ve given enough thought 
to it, have you?” Cris Benedetti 
asked him. “That’s really the way 
you want it?” 

“Yes, that’s the way I want it,” 
John Penandrew said. “And I’ve 
considered it pretty thoroughly.” 
“You’ve decided to live for- 
ever then, have you?” Barney 
Sheen asked with just a hint of 
boyish malice. 

“Naturally not to live forever 
here,” Penandrew attempted to 
explain. “I’ve decided to live only 
as long as the world lasts, unless I 
am called from my plan by pe- 
remptory order. I am resolved, 
however, to live for very many 



normal lifetimes. The idea appeals 
to me strongly.” 

“Have you decided just how 
you will bring this about?” Dr. 
George Drakos asked. 

“Not fully decided. I’ve begun 
to consider that part only recently. 
Of first importance is always the 
decision to do a thing. The means 
of carrying it out will have to fol- 
low that decision and flow from it. 
There is no real reason why I 
shouldn’t be able to do it, 
though.” 

“No, I suppose not,” Cris Ben- 
edetti said thoughtfully. “You’re 
an intelligent man and you’re used 
to tall problems. But there have 
been other intelligent men and, as 
far as I know, none of them has 
done this thing.” 

“Do you know of any really in- 
telligent man who has decided to 
do this and then has failed in the 
doing?” Penandrew asked. 

“No, not if you put it that 
way,” Cris admitted. “Most prob- 
lems remain unsolved simply be- 
cause they have never been tried 
seriously and in the proper frame- 
work. And there are legends of 
men (I presume them to have been 
intelligent) who have done this 
thing and are doing it. Not very 
reputable legends, though.” 

“Well, what is it then, an elixir 
of youth that you’ll be seeking?” 
Harry O’Donovan asked in his 
high voice. 

“No, Harry, that idea is clearly 
unworkable. It couldn’t be taken 



THE ALL-AT-ONCE-MAN 



75 




seriously by anyone except a 
youth,” Penandrew talked it out 
carefully. “It will not be an elixir 
of youth: it will be an elixir of all 
ages — that, I believe, is the crux of 
the matter. I do not want to be 
only a youth forever or for a very 
long time — I am more than just a 
youth now. It would not be possi- 
ble to remain a youth forever.” 

“Then what?” O’Donovan de- 
manded. “I don’t believe you’ve 
thought this out very thoroughly, 
John. Do you want to live for a 
very long time and you getting 
older and older and older all that 
time?” 

“But I have thought it out pret- 
ty thoroughly, Harry. I will get 
old only at one end, only in depth. 
I will become a complete man — 
and then still more complete. I be- 
lieve there is no record of any real- 
ly complete man’s ever dying — 
that’s the thing.” 

“I believe there is no record of 
any complete man at all,” George 
Drakos said. “That’s really the 
thing.” 

“There’s probably been a large 
handful of us,” Penandrew said. “I 
.. know pretty well what I want to do 
and I know pretty well what it con- 
sists of. I will become every aeon 
of myself simultaneously; then I 
will have become a complete man 
— and then I will not die. There is 
•a meaning within a meaning of the 
old word aeon. Aeon means ages. 
But the pleroma or plentitude is 
made up of substantial powers 



called aeons. I maintain that these 
two meanings are the same. In 
Gnosticism the aeon is one of the 
group of eternal beings that com- 
bine to form the supreme being — 
all are eternal and simultaneous 
but no one of them would be eter- 
nal out of combination. I believe 
that there is analogy on the human 
plain; and I intend to become that 
analogy, to be all my ages simul- 
taneously and forever, to be every 
aeon of myself. I will be forever a 
boy, forever a youth, forever a 
man and forever an old man. I’m 
already something of this multiple 
appearance. I’m told. I guarantee 
that I’ll be a boy forever. I’ll nail 
down that end.” 

“And what happens when the old 
man in you gets older and older 
and dies?” Drakos said. 

“I don’t know what will happen 
but I’m certainly interested in 
knowing, George. Possibly I will 
assume a still older man and then 
a still older. I’m not sure there is a 
necessary connection between very 
old age and death. It may be, 
though, that the extreme aeons of 
me will pass over the edge and give 
me a foot in each world. I’d like 
that. The possibilities are almost 
endless. But I believe that the boy 
in me, the youth in me, the man in 
me will live for innumerable life- 
times.” 

“Oh brother!” Harry O’Dono- 
van sounded in his high voice. 
“And how will you be doing it all? 
Not by talking about it. I’ll bet.”

“Yes>, I will do it by consider- 
able talking about it and by much 
more thinking about it,” Penan- 
drew ventured. “It is not a thing 
for gadgets or apparatuses, though 
1 may employ, them some. It is a 
thing, I believe, of mental and 
physical disposition and I tell you 
that I’m well disposed toward it.” 

T his John Penandrew who lived 
in the big house on Harrow 
street was married to Zoe Archi- 
kos. Barny Sheen would like to 
have been married to her. So 
would Cris Benedetti and Harry 
O’Donovan. So would George 
Drakos except that she was his 
cousin. Zoe was a creature that 
has become fairly rare these last 
twenty-five centuries: a blonde 
Grecian, a veritable Helen, a ge;n- 
uinely classic model with that 
brassiness that must go with it. 
The bronze age understood the ne- 
cessity of this high brass, but we 
have forgotten. 

Oh, she was form and life, she 
was perfection and brindled pas- 
sion — and she was also the blast of 
a brass horn. John Penandrew was 
fortunate in having her; she should 
have been elixir enough for any- 
one. But he was fortunate in al- 
most everything. 

T he fathers tell us that Adam, 
in his preternatural state, en- 
joyed all ages at once,” Barney 
Sheen said, “so it is not strictly 
true that he had no childhood, even 



though he was created adult. He 
was created all ages at once. It was 
a good trick till he broke it. And, 
by coincidence, I recently ran into 
the still surviving legend of the one 
man who, since Adam, is most 
persistently believed to have been 
all ages at once and to be still 
alive.” 

“Coincidence, which is simulta- 
neity, is valid when it touches a 
simultaneous man as I am becom- 
ing,” John Penandrew said with 
what would have been pomposity 
in another man. “Ah — where did 
you run into the latest legend of 
Prester John, Barney?” 

“In Ethiopia. I have several 
crews doing petroleum exploration 
work there and I visited there re- 
cently. Some of the simple local 
workmen talk of the everlasting 
man as if he were a present-day 
presence.” 

“Near Magdala, was it?” John 
Penandrew asked with sudden ea- 
gerness. 

“About seventy miles northwest 
of there, on the Guna slopes.” 

“I was sure it was near. Magda- 
la, of course, is a modern name- 
form of old Mogadbre, the legen- 
dary kingdom of Prester John.” 
“That’s impossible,” George 
Drakos cut in. “Anyone with even 
an elementary knowledge of the 
Amharic language would know 
that the one name could not 
change into the other.” 

“Anyone with even an elemen- 
tary knowledge of anything would 



THE ALL-AT-ONCE-MAN 



77 




know that both names are from 
the Geez and not the Amharic lan- 
guage,” Cris Benedetti sneered, 
“and there is a strong possibility 
that the two names are the same, 
George.” 

(It is sometimes confusing to 
have these acquaintances who 
know everything.) 

“But you can’t do it, John, in 
Ethiopia or anywhere; you can’t 
be the simultaneous man,” Cris 
continued. “You haven’t the integ- 
rity for it.” 

“Why not, Cris? I pay tithes of 
cummin and that other stuff. I love 
my wife and many other persons. I 
have a pleasant way with my mon- 
ey and I do not grind the faces of 
the poor. Why haven’t I integrity?” 

“You have common decency, 
John, but not integrity,” Cris said. 
“I use the word to mean unified 
totality and scope — that is integri- 
ty in the theological sense. I use 
the word as Tanquerey uses it.” 

(They used to study Tanquerey’s 
Dogmatic Theology in the semi- 
naries. Now they study rubbish.) 

“There are several ways I can 
go about this,” Penandrew said. 
“I believe that we originally had 
this simultaneity and everlasting- 
ness as a preternatural gift. Then 
we were deprived of it. But it re- 
mains a part of our preternatural 
nature. This means that we must 
be deprived of it all over again ev- 
ery day or it will flow back into 
us. It could be as simple a thing as 
actinic rays depriving us of this 



handy gift of everlasting life. I’ve 
studied these possibilities a little. 1 
could have a series of silver plates 
or baffles set into my head to com- 
bat the rays. That’s one way.” 
“What’s the other ways?” Bar- 
ney Sheen asked. 

“Oh, proper disposition of mind 
and body. Induced mystic states 
combined with my natural powers 
and proclivities. 1 believe that there 
may be gadgetry employed as a 
trigger — but only as a trigger for 
the alteration. I believe that it will 
be mostly realizing a state of being 
that already belongs to us, some- 
thing that belongs to our preter- 
natural nature.” 

“Or our unnatural nature,” 
Barney said. “You didn’t use to 
play so loose with words. What’s 
the other way, John?” 

“Oh, I may go and find Prester 
John and learn how he’s been do- 
ing it these thousands of years,” 
John Penandrew said. “And I will 
go and do likewise.” 

“Did you ever hear anything 
like that, Laff?” Barney asked me. 
“Has the subject ever been handled 
in your — ah, pardon my smile — 
field?” 

“Several stories have handled 
the subject,” I said, “but not in the 
variation that Penandrew wants to 
give it.”

DICTIONARY OF THE OSAGE 
LANGUAGE— FRANCIS LA 
FLESCHE 

OHN PENANDREW was out 
of town for about a year. When 
he came back he had a different 
look to him. Oh, he had simulta- 
neity now! He really had it. He 
was the boy he had been thirty 
years ago; he was the youth he had 
been twenty years ago; he was the 
man he should have been now and 
he was also an older man. He was 
all these several persons or ages at 
once, much more than he had been 
before — all of them, completely 
and unconflictingly. He had pulled 
it off. He was truly the simulta- 
neous man. But that isn’t exactly 
what we mean when we say that he 
had a different look to him. 

In all his simultaneous persons 
he had something just a little bit 
lopsided about him. One eye was 
always just a little bit larger than 
the other. There was more than a 
hint of deformity and there 
shouldn’t have been this in a com- 
plete man. 

But he was the complete man 
now. He had done it. He had 



pulled the coup. He was wound up 
all the way and he would live for- 
ever unless he flew apart. This was 
no fakery. You could feel that he 
had done it. 

He lived in the big house on 
Harrow Street with the brassy 
classy Zoe and they lived it to the 
hilt. There wasn’t ever anyone in 
such a hurry to have so much fun 
so fast. They were perfervid about 
it. But why should he be in such a 
hurry when he had forever? 

Well, he had money and he had 
talent and he had Zoe. The boy 
was strong in him now (he had 
been a loud-mouthed kid but smart 
all the time and smooth when he 
wanted to be); the youth was in 
him very strong (he had been a 
gilded youth or at least a very 
brassy one); and the man and the 
older man were vital and shouting 
in him. The Penandrews were cut- 
ting a wide swath and they were 
much in the papers. But what was 
John’s big hurry now? 

“Add one dimension, then you 
might as well add another.” He 
grinned with a grin a little too lop- 
sided for a complete and simul- 
taneous man. “Speed, that’s the 
thing. Speed forever and lean 
heavy on that hooting horn.” 

But it was another year before 
myself and those five men who 
knew everything were all together 
again. 

JOHN PENANDREW lolled

he were too full of mischief to 
talk. And Barnaby Sheen wound 
into one of his cosmic theses, of 
which he had hundreds: 

“Just before the Beginning there 
was a perfect sphere and no other 
thing.” Barney spoke in his rich 
voice. “At least it supposed itself 
to be a perfect sphere — it had no 
imperfect spheroid with which to 
compare itself. It suspected that it 
was revolving at a very high rate of 
speed, such a rate of speed that it 
would immediately fly apart if the 
rotation could be established as 
fact. But in relation to what point 
could it be rotating? 

“It was not in space — there was 
no space beyond it; how could 
there be? It could not be in mo- 
tion, of course, there being nothing 
relative to it. Neither could it be 
at rest — in relation to what could 
it be at rest? It was not in time nor 
in eternity, there being nothing to 
pose it against in either aspect. It 
had no size, for there was nothing 
to which it might be compared — it 
might be a pinhead in size, or a 
mega-megalo. It had no tempera- 
ture, it had no mass, it had no 
gravity — all of these things are rel- 
ative to other things. 

“Then an exterior speck ap- 
peared. This was the Beginning, 
not the sphere’s lone existence. 
The mere speck was less than one 
billionth to the billionth power the 
diameter of the sphere and was at 
much more than a billion billions 
of diameters from it. Now there 



was both contrast and relationship. 

“Now there was size and mass 
and temperature, space, time and 
motion; for there was something 
to relate to. The sphere was indeed 
found to be in furious and power- 
ful rotation, now that it could ro- 
tate in relation to something. It 
was in such rapid rotation that it 
deformed itself with its own cen- 
trifugal force, it ruptured itself, it 
flowed apart completely and every- 
thing thence is from its pieces. 

“What happened to the speck? 
Was it consumed in the great ex- 
plosion? Probably not. Likely it 
had never existed at all. It was a 
mere illusion to get things started. 
Say, I consider that an excellent 
‘In the Beginning’ bit. Can you use 
that, Laff? Can you make a piece 
out of that piece?” 

“I will use it some day,” I said. 

“The important thing about that 
speck was its duration.” John Pen- 
andrew licked the words out with a 
tongue that now seemed a little 
lop-sided. “It lasted for much less 
than a billionth of a billionth of a 
second. It was in contrast to the 
short-duration speck that the then- 
happening cosmos acquired its de- 
lusion of immortality.” 

“You are sure it is a delusion. 
Pen?” Cris Benedetti asked anx- 
iously, as though much depended 
on the answer. 

“Yes, all a delusion,” Penan- 
drew grinned. “We cosmic types 
call it the workable delusion, and 
we will work it for all it is worth.”

“Tell us the truth, Penandrew,” 
Barnaby Sheen said gruffly. “Did 
you really do it? And how did you 
do it?” 

“I really did it, Barney. I’ll not 
die. I’ll dance on your graves and 
on the graves of your great-great- 
grandchildren. I’ll make a point of 
it. I’ll dance naked on the graves 
as David danced before the Ark.” 

“Why such frenzied pleasure in 
our going. Pen?” Cris asked with 
some hurt. 

“It’s the boy in me. He’s a bit 
monstrous now and he’s me. I 
can’t change him or any of us or 
it will all collapse. It’s mine. I’ll 
hang onto it. I’ll bow my back. I 
won’t give an inch ever. I’ve got 
a mind-set in me now — that’s a big 
part of it.” 

“Yes, I believe you did pull it 
off, Penandrew,” Barney said 
slowly. “How did you do it, 
though? By elixir? By plates 
against the rays? By Prester John’s 
secret? How?” 

“Oh yes, I finally lifted the se- 
cret from Prester John himself and 
now 1 will not die in the natural 
course of things. But I’ll not tell 
you about it. You don’t need to 
know about it. Why should you 
want to know?” 

“We also might want to avoid 
dying in the natural course of 
things,” Doctor George Drakos 
said softly. 

“No, no, that’s impossible,” 
Penandrew shouted. “I won’t be 
done out of it by anyone. I’ll hold 



onto it for dear life — and that is 
exactly the case of it.” 

“Is it an exclusive thing?” Har- 
ry O’Donovan asked, “and it can’t 
be shared?” 

“It cannot be shared,” Penan- 
drew said harshly. “It isn’t any- 
thing like you think it is. It isn’t at 
all as I thought it might be. It be- 
came a freak in its general with- 
drawal. It’s a jealous thing. It’s a 
snake in the hand and it must be 
held tightly. It isn’t the preternat- 
ural thing I thought it would be. 
It’s an unnatural thing now — and 
only one person in the world can 
have it at a time, for all time. I 
won’t let go of it. Hack my hands 
off — but I won’t let go of it!” 

“How is Prester John?” Barney 
Sheen asked in a strong low tone. 

“Oh, leave off the legends,” 
Harry O’Donovan sounded angri- 
ly. “If there was a Prester John ev- 
er — he’s been dead these thousand 
years.” 

“No. About eighteen months,” 
Penandrew said. “I found him 
alive. And now he is dead.” 

“You killed him,” Barney said 
simply. 

“How would I kill him?” Penan- 
drew protested. “He died of old 
age and God knows that that is the 
truth. He crumbled to dust. Why 
should he not have died of old age? 
Do you know how long he had 
been around? He saw Rome fall. 
And Jerusalem.” 

“What did you take from him?” 
Barney Sheen asked. 



THE ALL-AT-ONCE-MAN 



81 




“I took the jealous thing, the 
only thing. And now I will not die 
in the natural course of things. He 
wanted me to take it. He had been 
trying to give it to someone for a 
long time.” 

“That is the truth?” Sheen 
asked. 

“That is the truth,” Penandrew 
said. And it was the truth, we all 
knew that, but it was a lopsided 
truth. Penandrew left us suddenly 
then. 

“May the sun come up on him 
crooked in the morning,” Harry 
O’Donovan said bitterly. 

But in the big house on Harrow 
Street, John and Zoe Penandrew 
lived it up to the haft. It was speed 
forever and lean heavy on the 
hooting horn. There was some- 
thing a little disreputable about 
the couple now — if that word can 
be used of rich and positioned peo- 
ple. 

John grew older only in the old 
man of him. The boy in him was 
still the boy, the youth still the 
youth, the man still the man. He 
was living at least four lives at 
once, all at high speed and all for- 
ever. Zoe became more buxom 
and more classic, more brassy, 
more lively. If she aged at all she 
did it entrancingly and disgraceful- 
ly — but not ungracefully. There 
was nobody like her. She was full 
and overflowing, always. 

All the fun that could be 
crammed into every day and night! 
Speed, and the dangerous teetering 



that goes with very high speed. 
They went on forever. 

Actually they went on for ten 
years. Then Zoe left him and he 
broke up. 

No. He broke up first and then 
she left him. 

“I lost it,” he said, “and I 
couldn’t have. Nobody could ever 
have got it out of my grip.” 

HI 

For his duration too there is 
a word — the word Aevum or 
Aeviternity, the duration of 
that in which its essence or 
substance knows no change: 
though by its accidents it can 
know change. 

THEOLOGY AND SANITY— 
F.J. SHEED 

I T WAS then that the doings in 
the house on Harrow Street 
took a peculiar turn. Things had 
been hectic when Zoe was there; 
they had been noisy and publicized. 
But, whatever Zoe was, she was 
always High Brass. She’d had 
class. Now the house and happen- 
ings degenerated. 

John Penandrew brought those 
three nephews of his into the big 
house to live with him. They were 
a crass bunch. There was some- 
thing pretty low about them, and 
they brought John pretty low. A 
man should not be ashamed of his 
poor relations, of course: he 
should help them if they need help; 



82 



GALAXY 




and perhaps it was the essence of 
charity that John should take them 
into his own house. John had real 
charity in his heart; there is no tak- 
ing that away from him. He also 
had baser things there and they be- 
gan to pour out of it now. The 
three nephews were bums and John 
Penandrew became a bum along 
with them. Rich bums are the 
worst kind. 

And there was no doubting the 
kinship. All three of the fellows 
had the family look strongly. They 
were loudmouths, as John had al- 
ways been a little — but they were 
not smart and they were not 
smooth, as John could be when he 
wished. They all had what I can 
only call a facial deformity and 
they had it to a grotesque degree 
where John had it only to a minor 
extent. It was that lopsided look. 
It was that one eye bigger than the 
other. Coming out of that clan, 
John Penandrew came by his own 
slight deformity honestly. 

There were low-life doings at 
the big house on Harrow Street. 
The four Penandrew males each 
seemed to bring in seven cronies 
worse than himself. There were ri- 
otous doings there and the black 
maria was a frequent visitor to 
those doors. There was the aroma 
of stale evil in all this and John 
hadn’t used to be a bad sort of 
man. 

John Penandrew talked rational- 
ly but sadly whenever we came 
across him. 

THE ALL-AT-ONCE-MAN 



“I should never have taken the 
thing,” he said. “I knew before I 
finally seized it that it was wrong 
and unnatural. And, having taken 
it, I should have been willing to let 
it go easier when I found what de- 
formity it really was. ‘The corrup- 
tion of the best is the worst—’ do 
you remember when we were 
taught that? This excellent gift was 
taken away from us long ago, and 
for a reason. I had it as a tainted 
and forbidden remnant, and I held 
onto it like a snake in the hand. 
But I will not easily give up any 
strong idea that I have held. I have 
an intransigent mind. Do you re- 
member when we were taught to 
have thaf] I held it too tight, and it 
shattered me.” 

And in fact John Penandrew was 
a shattered man now — or a splat- 
tered one. The sap had been all 
drained out of him, as though the 
nephews were sapsuckers or blood- 
suckers who preyed on him. He 
weathered badly. Now he looked 
older than he was and he no longer 
looked all ages at once. He aged 
monstrously — he leered and lolled. 
He seemed to be returning to most 
unaromatic dust. 

He had given up his chairman- 
ships of the boards and his associa- 
tions with the banks. It was their 
loss. He had always been very 
smart in matters of business and 
policy. He knew that that was fin- 
ished with him now. He took his 
money and went home. 

And that home was a shipwreck. 

83 




The middle nephew was as queer 
as a glass-egg goose. He had a 
stack of morals charges against 
him and John Penandrew had 
thousands of dollars of bond out 
on him. He was an almost person- 
able fellow, but he was slanted — 
how he was slanted! 

The youngest nephew was no 
more than a boy — a cat-killing, 
window-breaking, arsonous vandal 
who led a wild pack and always 
left a trail right up to the Harrow 
Street house. What things he got 
away with because he was not yet 
adult! And him much more intri- 
cate than the adults who had to 
deal with him and much more 
deadly — it is pretty certain that he 
killed larger and higher things than 
cats and broke more fragile things 
than windows. 

The oldest nephew, a twisted hu- 
morist, an almost good fellow, was 
the instigator of the endless series 
of sick parties held in the big 
house, the procurer of the dozen 
or so florid witches who always 
came with the dark. He was an ex- 
perimenter in the vices, an innova- 
tor of reputation. 

John Penandrew had become an 
old and dirty caricature of himself. 
There was something artificial 
about him now, as though he were 
no more than a mask and effigy 
propped up on a display float at 
some garish carnival. The shape he 
was in, John Penandrew surely 
could not go on forever and he 
didn’t. 



After about three years of co- 
habitation with the nephews, John 
Penandrew died. That should have 
wrecked the legend. Maybe not, 
though. Well, it really seemed that 
he did not die in the natural course 
of things. There was something 
most unnatural about the course 
of his dying, as though he had 
turned to dust before he died; as 
though what died was not himself 
at all; as though the dying were an 
incident, almost an afterthought. 

He wasn’t much more than fifty 
years old. He looked ninety. Zoe 
didn’t come to the funeral. 

“He isn’t in very good shape 
right now,” she said. “I’ll wait a 
few months, and then go back to 
him when things are looking a lit- 
tle better with him.” She wasn’t at 
all distraught; she was just not 
making sense. She left the country 
the night before the funeral. 

A fter the funeral mass, after 
the Zecharih Canticle when the 
body is taken out from the church, 
Barnaby Sheen whispered to the 
priest in the vestibule: 

“I don’t believe you’ve got him 
all there.” 

“I don’t believe so either,” the 
priest whispered back. 

Zoe inherited. 

The nephews? No, they didn’t 
get anything. 

There was something a little bit 
loose about those nephews. They 
weren’t — ah — seen again. No trace 
was found of them, either back-

ward or forward. They simply 
hadn’t been. In the legal and re- 
corded sense, at least, John Penan- 
drew hadn’t had any nephews. He 
had had attributes, we suppose, but 
not nephews. Well, peace to the 
pieces of the poor rich man! 

I T’S a moral paradigm, really, 
of a man who reached for too 
much and was shattered by it. It’s 
a neat instance of final moral com- 
pensation and seemliness. Yes, ex- 
cept that it wasn’t neat; that this 
wasn’t the final part of it; and that 
the compensation was not particu- 
larly moral. 

It was not neat because there 
were pieces left sticking out of it — 
a primordial brass horn that surely 
wasn’t Gabriel’s; and three, at 
least, noisy persons in the house 
on Harrow Street. 

But it was not stated that the 
nephews were not heard from 
again. They were heard. Oh how 
they were heard! They were the 
noisiest unbodied bodies that ever 
assaulted honest ears. They and 
their florid witches (unseen also) 
made the nights — well — interesting 
for quite some months in that long 
block on Harrow Street. 

This was the first phase of the 
Haunted House in Harrow Street. 
It was featured in Sunday supple- 
ments everywhere, likely in your 
own town paper. It was included in 
books like Beyond the Strange. It 
became a classic instance. 

And that was only the first phase 

THE ALL-AT-ONCE-MAN 



of the Haunted House episode. 
The next phase was not so loudly 
trumpeted (don’t use that word in 
this case) to the world. There was 
a tendency to play it down. It was 
too hell-fire hot to handle. 

Zoe came back to town, bright 
and big and brassy as ever. A clas- 
sic personage. Zoe. How the clas- 
sic has been underestimated and 
misunderstood! But she came in 
almost silently, muted brass with 
only a hint of the dazzle and blare. 

“I believe that things will be 
looking a little better with my hus- 
band John now,” she said. “He 
should be better composed by this 
time. I am his wife. I will just 
move in with him again and be the 
proper wife to him.” 

“Move in where?” Harry 
O’ Donovan asked aghast, “into 
the grave?” 

“Oh no. I’ll move back into the 
house on Harrow Street and live 
there with my husband.” 

“Zoe, did you take the, well, 
thing from John?” Barney Sheen 
asked curiously. 

“Yes, I took it, Barney, but on- 
ly for this short while. I’ll give it 
back to him now. He may be able 
to cope with it this time. I don’t 
need such things for myself. This 
time I am certain that we will have 
a long and entertaining life togeth- 
er. All things coalesce for us now.” 
“Zoe, you’re not making sense. 
John Penandrew is dead!” Cris 
Benedetti shouted. 

“Who isn’t?” she asked simply. 

85 




“I’ll bet you though, Cris — ’’ (rau- 
cous horn blowing in the far dis- 
tance) “that he’s more alive than 
you are at this minute. Or you or 
you or you or you. If any of you 
were as alive as he is, I’d have 
you.’’ 

“You’re out of your wits, Zoe,” 
George Drakos said and blinked. 
There was something the matter 
with Drakos’ eyes, with all of our 
eyes. Somewhere a brassy shimmer 
of the second brightest light that 
human eyes will ever see. The four 
men who knew everything did not 
know Zoe Archikos; much less did 
I. 

Z OE moved back into the house 
on Harrow Street. And how 
was it with her there? Noisy, noisy. 
Some things at least coalesced for 
her or into her: among these, the 
florid witches who used to come 
with the dark. Their voices had 
been so jangling because they were 
broken voices, part voices. Now 
they were together in that dozen- 
toned instrument, the red-brass, 
the flesh-brass. They had never 
been anything other than wraiths 
of her. Now she was all one again. 

There was some evidence also 
(shouting, grisly evidence) that the 
aeons or nephews or attributes had 
all coalesced into John Penandrew 
again. 

Well, that is the sort of thing 
that a town must live with, or die 
with; but it will not live on a nor- 
mal course. 



L isten. No, not with your 
ears! Listen with your crawling 
flesh! Did you yourself ever meet 
a man after you had seen him 
dead? It does give you a dread, 
does it now? There was no need of 
elaboration. John Penandrew was 
a humorist but by that time he had 
become a little edgy of horror hu- 
mor. There was none of that com- 
ing through the walls business. He 
came in normally by the door and 
sat down. 

“Jesus Christ!’’ Barney Sheen 
moaned. “Are you a ghost, John?’’ 
“The very opposite,” Penandrew 
said softly. “In fact, I had to give 
up the ghost.” Penandrew was that 
kind of humorist, but even bad 
Jokes are shocking from a man 
who’s supposed to be dead. 

“It wasn’t all of you in the cof- 
fin was it, John?” Barney asked in 
wonder. 

“No. Only my older aspect went 
over the edge. I once thought that 
this would give me a foot in each 
world and I was curious about it. 
It didn’t work that way. I have no 
consciousness of that aspect now; 
nor, I suppose, has he of me. I 
shuffled off the mortal coil there. 
I’ve won. That’s something. No- 
body else ever won at it, except 
those like Zoe who were already 
preternatural.” 

“You’re a damned zombie, Pen- 
andrew!” Harry O’Donovan cried 
in shrill anger. 

“Can a zombie be damned?” 
Penandrew asked. “I don’t know. 



86 



GALAXY 




Tell me, Chris. You were the the- 
ology student. For damnation is 
there not required a nature of a 
certain moment? But I’m of an- 
other moment now. Momentum, 
I am saying, which means a move- 
ment and a power and a weight; 
and ‘moment of time’ is only part 
of its meaning and only part of 
mine.” 

“Damn your Latin! You’re a 
deformity,” O’Donovan cried. 

“Yes, I’m a deformed curve, the 
one that never closes on itself,” 
Penandrew said with his lopsided 
smile. “Barney Sheen’s ‘In the Be- 
ginning’ bit left something out. 
There was what might have been a 
perfect sphere, yes. There was, 
possibly, an exterior speck for con- 
trast. I say that there was some- 
thing else, one curve that would 
not close when everything else 
closed into the rather neat package 
that called itself The Cosmos, the 
Beauty. There was one shape left 
over. I am part of that other shape. 
Try being a little lopsided some- 
times, men. You’ll live longer by 
it.” 

That was the last real talk that 
we ever had with John Penandrew. 
He never sought our company 
again and we sure never sought 
his. 

N obody else lives in that long 
block on Harrow Street now, 
but the noises are over-riding in 
that whole part of town. There is 
nothing the law can do. It is always 

THE ALL-AT-ONCE-MAN 



that beautifully brassy woman 
there when they call and always 
with her artless answers: 

“It is only myself and my hus- 
band together here,” Zoe says, 
“and we taking our simple plea- 
sures together. Is that so wrong?” 
Even coppers get that funny look 
in their eyes when they have been 
hexed by the prevading sound of 
the brass winds. 

Old boys and young men often 
gather near that house at night and 
howl like wolves from the glandu- 
lar ghosts that the strange flesh 
calls up in them. But even the 
most aroused of them will not at- 
tempt the house or the doors. 

The Penandrews are a unique 
couple taking their pleasures to- 
gether all at once forever, and so 
violently as to drive the whole 
town stone-deaf — like those old 
stone-deaf statues, their only real 
kindred? For these two will not die 
in any natural course of things, 
not with that big loud bright brassy 
horn blowing in a distance, and at 
absolute close range, all at once, 
everywhere, unclosed, lop-sided. 
It’s the ending that hasn’t any end. 
The Stone is found, and it’s an 
older texture than the philosophers 
believed. The transmutation is ac- 
complished, into brass. Classic and 
koine: this is the Zoe who dies 
hardly forever; this is the Penan- 
drew, the man of the wrong shape. 

The four men who know every- 
thing understand it now. 

And I do not. ^

JT HAD little to do with the technical/^pects of 
the hookup — both nations had long^^nce mas- 
tered the necessary techniques. It w^s, rather, the 
political overtone of the operation that gripped the 
entire world with prayerful anticipqiion. 

Long months at the conference tables of half a 
dozen world capitals had gone into the final prepa- 
rations for this historic cooperative effort. Long 
years of meticulous planning had pushed irrevoca- 
bly toward its ultimate success. Long centuries of 



89 



quiet dreaming had gently pointed 
toward its fruition. 

A thousand miles above the 
curving spread of the Pacific 
Ocean, where an imaginary line 
split fragments of time into days, 
the United States of America and 
the Soviet Union would soon join 
outstretched hands. 

The two-man American space 
team, consisting of veteran astro- 
nauts Reynolds and Fletcher, was 
already on its way. They dropped 
a gigantic stage near the Florida 
coast and burned an arching tra- 
jectory toward the bulge of Africa. 

Within a few dramatically 
thrifty minutes of the united space 
age, the Russian cosmonauts were 
concluding their countdown. The 
Soviet team, Zhutrovich and Zhu- 
trovich, recently joined as husband 
and wife, poised for launch. 

More anxious moments around 
a breathless sphere and two tum- 
bling ships were in orbit. The 
Earth breathed out deep messages 
of congratulations, and bourbon 
and vodka permeated the atmo- 
spheric blanket. 

The American spaceship Wash- 
ington, D.C. Ill whirled in its 
great oval orbit, biding its time 
with the distant stars. Its crew was 
relaxing with the prospect of sev- 
eral panoramic sightseeing hours 
ahead, prior to the final intricate 
maneuvering needed to reach the 
rendezvous point. 

The elated astronauts watched 
the steady lights of Earth skim be- 



neath their cartwheeling ship, sa- 
voring the beauty and the splendid 
wonder of it all, when they heard a 
determined clanging beyond the in- 
ner door of the air lock. 

“It’s too soon,” said Reynolds, 
somewhat alarmed. 

“I’ll radio back,” said Fletcher 
— but he stood frozen. 

“No,” said the senior-ranked 
Reynolds, reaching for his airtight 
helmet. “They must be in trou- 
ble.” 

Quickly they secured their in- 
verted fish-bowl helmets and 
moved with highly trained preci- 
sion to unbolt the air-lock door. 

The desperate clanging contin- 
ued. 

“They have a woman aboard,” 
said Fletcher through the wire 
trails of the intercom. His voice 
was edged with soft metal. 

“They’re hours ahead of sched- 
ule,” said Reynolds, glancing at 
the glowing console clock. 

As they completed their task the 
violent clanging stopped. With fi- 
nal mated movements the Ameri- 
cans opened their end of the air 
lock. They bent their crystal- 
domed heads and peered cautious- 
ly through the yawning hatchway. 

“It’s empty,” said Reynolds, 
with surprise barely buried within 
his crackling-metal voice. 

“Not quite,” breathed Fletcher. 

He stepped back from the hatch. 

A dog-sized form like a shining 
black beetle scurried into their 
ship. ★

something like seventy-five percent channels to jet out into space from

the electron waste tube and the ion 
exhaust jets. 

Primitive, inefficient, uneconom- 
ical. But magnetism, gravity, re- 
sisted conquest with the tenacity of 
a blob of chewing gum on a the- 
ater seat. 

The ship trembled. It plunged 
through space at a speed of 3 x 108 
feet per second. Difficult? Try 
2.1 X 108 mph. Still difficult? 
Make it over 56,800 miles per sec- 
ond, then couple that to a 2.1759- 
G acceleration and reach for your 
slipstick. A waste of time, that — 
one of the ship’s four passengers is 
Jealous of his responsibility and his 
computer tells him .acceleration is 
steady at seventy feet per second 
toward a goal of 186,300 mps. Or 
thereabouts. 

“I’ll bet on energy,’’ the comp- 
tech said. He patted his computer. 
It winked at him, humming. 
“That’s what ole Cal means. I’m 
sure, and I go along with whatever 
Cal says. Energy.” 

“That is not what Cal says, 
Tom” the captain told him. He 
spun idly back and forth in his 
chair, facing the other three men. 
He was a captain of men, not ma- 
chinery — the computer decided 
what to do and when to do it and 
told the ship and the ship obeyed. 
The captain was about as neces- 
sary to the ship’s operation as the 
quintillions of watts of energy the 
engines wasted as a matter of 
course because Man could not 
wait for a better way. “Cal says he 



does not know. ‘Insufficient data: 
Warning’ does not mean Cal com- 
putes we’ll be converted to ener- 
gy.” He grinned at the reporter. 
“You agree?” 

“With you? Or that we’ll be con- 
verted to energy?” 

The captain nodded, grinning. 
“Yep.” 

The reporter shuddered. “How 
about some alternatives?” 

“Oh man! There’s an infinity of 
’em,” the captain said and chuck- 
led at his joke. He swung in his 
chair, back and forth, back and 
forth, one hand flat on the steel 
panel running along the steel bulk- 
head behind him. “Doc?” 

The government physicist looked 
up. He was calculating, using gen- 
ine paper — lined — and a genuine 
pen, ballpoint. “Hm? What?” 
“Tom’s computer would be de- 
lighted to do whatever you’re do- 
ing, Doc — and Tom would be dou- 
ble-delighted to feed it in.” 

“Oh, I’m sure of that,” the 
physicist said. His manner was em- 
barrassed. He waved the pen. 
“Habit. I use computers, too, of 
course.” 

“What do those artifacts of 
yours tell you?” Tom asked. 

The physicist chuckled, looking 
down at the paper. “They tell me I 
can’t work worth a damn at two- 
plus gees. Also — insufficient data. 
I’m just like Cal. I don’t know.” 
“Cal,” Tom said, his chin as- 
suming a Mussolini tilt, “does 
know. All we lack is being smart 



92 



GALAXY 




enough to know how to ask the 
questions. Cal can answer them.” 

T he captain sighed. “Okay. Tom 
says we’ll wind up as energy, 
Doc, because he thinks that’s the 
‘Insufficient data’ his machine 
complains about, and that’s why it 
says ‘Warning.’ We have lots of 
time. Suppose we try to live with 
the data we have and play guessing 
games. What’s your theory?” 

Doc leaned back and frowned. 
His chin sagged badly under two 
gravities acceleration. “Einstein 
said that no energy can be trans- 
mitted at a velocity greater than 
the speed of light — c. If we hit c, 
we’ll still be in the process of trans- 
mission even if we, uh become en- 
ergy. Thus — ” 

“If we bust one rule,” Tom said, 
“we can bust another. “I say we 
become energy at the instant we 
hit c.” He twisted a little to pat the 
gleaming hide of his computer. 
“And Cal knows it. He thinks — ” 
“Cal,” the physicist said, “does 
not think.” 

The comptech raised a finger to 
his lips and rolled his eyes. “Sh, 
Cal’s sensitive!” 

Three men laughed. The reporter 
was frowning. “Uh — look. Sup- 
pose you just pretend I’m a three- 
year-old in the first grade, okay?” 
The captain looked eager. 
“Start from how far back?” 

The computer technician and the 
physicist appeared just as delighted 
at the opportunity to show off. 

ASK A SILLY QUESTION 



Which was what the reporter 
wanted, of course — he knew the 
theory backward and forward or 
he would not have been on board. 

“Try starting,” he said, looking 
sheepish, “with E=mcT” 

“Wow!” Tom rolled his eyes in 
the general direction of his hair- 
line, which appeared to have re- 
treated from previous threats. 
“You came along without know- 
ing an ionized thing? Man, you’re 
either dedicated or crazy! You re- 
alize we’ll probably wind up look- 
ing like a supernova, with everyone 
on Earth trying to decide which of 
us to name it after.” 

“I know there’s danger,” the re- 
porter said. “I’ve had that kind of 
assignment before. I also know this 
is the biggest story since the Cuda- 
hy Equations.” 

The captain was shaking his 
head, wearing his lady-killer smile 
again — worthless on this ship. He 
reached up to push his fingers 
through his blond burr-cut. “E = 
mc^ means a given mass — that’s 
m, and that’s us — is transformed 
into E for energy at the speed of 
light, in centimeters squared. Too 
plain. Doc?” 

The physicist moved his shoul- 
ders in a shrug. “It’ll do.” 

“Everything’s relative to every- 
thing else. And interdependent — 
space, time, matter. Space and 
time, interdependent, depend also 
on us, as observers. They aren’t 
absolute, I mean. Einstein’s law — 
which we’ve gone back to calling 

93 




‘theory’ — says we can’t exceed c. 
Because as we accelerate we gain 
mass. At almost-light, our mass 
doubles. At c, our mass becomes 
infinite.” 

“That’s a meaningless phrase,” 
the reporter prompted. “Totally 
meaningless, like ten billion dol- 
lars. It’s inconceivable. Anyhow — 
so what would happenT' 

“That’s what our feller ’murri- 
cans are shelling out an inconceiv- 
able amount of money for us to 
find out,” the captain told him. 
“One theory says the universe 
would collapse, whatever that 
means. Implode, sort of. Point is, 
since Cudahy we think Einstein 
postulated his theory, not the Uni- 
verse’s Law. Maybe. No big deal 
there: Newton was right for a long 
time but no one tried to apotheo- 
size him. Einstein was nearly made 
a god. People in science have a bad 
habit of accepting what’s in their 
books, without asking why and 
what if. I think that’s why a lot of 
’em are in science; it’s a nice, safe 
haven, like a convent. Every now 
and then some boat-rocker with a 
bump of curiosity and a little 
imagination pops up and becomes 
Galileo or Newton or Maxwell or 
Planck or Einstein — or Cudahy.” 

“Or something else,” the physi- 
cist said. “But I happen to agree 
with Doctor Cudahy — which 
doesn’t stop me from admitting he 
might be crazy as a bedbug. And 
my presence here indicates I am. 
Ever hear of Stefan Christesco?” 



He showed surprise when all 
tlwee of the others shook their 
heads. He smiled. “I’ll tell you 
why. Christesco published a book 
in nineteen-twenty-five in defense 
of Euclidean geometry. He tore in- 
to Einstein and Lorentz and Min- 
kovski and wound up saying their 
postulates belonged to ‘the domain 
of the imaginary and the absurd.’ 
Cudahy’s been attacked, too. So 
have I, for the matter of that. So, 
when the decision was made to 
send out a manned ship to find out, 
I volunteered and then fought to 
come. A lot of my detractors 
didn’t express any desire to prove 
themselves right the hard way — 
wouldn’t have looked through Gal- 
ileo’s telescope, either.” 

“Crazy as a bedbug,” the comp- 
tech said. “But I haven’t heard 
your theory. Doctor Bowers.” 



T he physicist leaned back and 
poked at his chin with his pen. 
“You may be right. But bear in 
mind that you are interpreting that 
computer’s answer. It hasn’t given 
an answer, for the matter of that; 
it’s given a definite lack of one. 
And remember this — the word ‘in- 
tuit’ wasn’t invented for comput- 
ers. 1 think we can marry Einstein 
and Cudahy. Suppose it’s true we 
can’t exceed the speed of light. 
What does that mean? It means 
relative to us, to what we know. Or 
think we know. In this universe, 
this plane, this dimension — this 



94 



GALAXY 




coil, if you want to go Shakespear- 
ean. So — at the speed of light I 
wonder if we won’t just, uh, slip 
sideways into another dimension. I 
doubt time. 1 expect something al- 
together else, a fifth one, if you 
need a word. Where the railroad 
tracks come together. Where time 
is — abbreviated. Where we can ex- 
ceed c, in that plane.” 

“Sort of the universe next 
door?” the reporter asked. The 
physicist smiled and nodded. The 
reporter looked at the captain. 
“And you? What do you think. 
Captain?” 

“I think we’re going to be stuck 
with each other for a long, long 
time and you’d better call me Bob. 
Meanwhile, I don’t theorize much. 
I’m just curious. What’s ‘infinity?’ 
What does infinite mean? What’s it 
like in no-Time no-Space?” He 
shrugged. “I volunteered and got 
picked. I asked just one question.” 
He waited, and they waited. “Go- 
ing to stare me down without ask- 
ing, huh? Okay. I asked, ‘Does 
light have mass and energy?’ ” 

Doctor Bowers nodded, smiling. 
“That’s an old one. Then how 
come it travels at lightspeed, eh?” 

The reporter sighed. “The A- 
bomb proved Einstein, right? And 
you think you’re going to become 
one?” 

“A real whopiper,” Tom said. 

“Assuming we get back — sorry, 
Tom,” the reporter said, “am I go- 
ing to be allowed to quote this 
theorizing-before-the-fact?” 

ASK A SILLY QUESTION 



“Ask me again,” the physicist 
smiled, "post facto." 

“One thing about it,” the cap- 
tain sighed. “If you’re right. Doc, 
Tom and that Cal of his will just 
have to decide how they want their 
crow cooked. But if Tom’s right, 
you’ll never have to listen to his I- 
told-you-so.” 

“But, the point is we can’t do 
it,” the reporter said, stepping 
back into the discussion. “As Doc 
said, Cudahy’s equations are just 
that: figures on paper. Th^y have 
yet to be field-tested.” 

“You’ve been stringing us 
along,” the captain said. “You 
know all about it, don’t you?” 

“Well — suppose I challenge you 
back. I’ll bet not one in a hundred 
or maybe more can give the mean- 
ing of E=mc L But Einstein said 
no material body or anything bear- 
ing energy could exceed the speed 
of light because — because it would 
require infinite energy?” 

The comptech nodded. “With re- 
spect to the observer,” he said. 
“And don’t forget the business 
about achieving infinite mass. 
We’re gaining now. I say it’s im- 
possible for our mass to reach in- 
finity, whatever that is — but I’m 
no Chris Whoever-Doc-said. I say 
that at c we’ll be converted into 
pure energy. Relatively speaking, I 
mean.” He grinned. “Relative to 
us. And I believe in Cal. Cal 
doesn’t goof. If I’m wrong, I eat 
crow, not Cal. He says we haven’t 
told him enough for him to give us 



95 




an answer — either that or he 
doesn’t have the, the vocabulary to 
answer us. I keep trying, every 
time I think of another way to 
ask.” 

The reporter’s mind was nearly 
as audible as the mechanical one 
behind Tom. “And that is the 
point,” he said. “That there isn’t 
any absolute motion. It’s all rela- 
tive. Right?” 

“Relative,” Doctor Bowers said, 
“to something.” He stressed the fi- 
nal word and looked meaningfully 
at the reporter, then at Bob and 
Tom, his eyes large and round and 
ingenuous-looking as a kitten’s. 
“But we can go on and on with our 
speculating. Try this. No material 
body. Suppose at the instant we 
hit c we become immaterial. And 
at the instant we drop under light- 
speed we — materialize again. Voi- 
la!" 

“That’s strictly an evasion,” 
Tom said. “But we’re about to 
find out.” He swung around to his 
pet. “Tell us when. Cal. Accelera- 
tion constant at seventy feet per 
second. Velocity . .” He contin- 
ued to speak quietly to the shiny 
metal cabinet with its ornamenta- 
tion of dials and gauges and keys 
and its ‘mouth,’ a television screen. 
It chattered back. 

The ship surged on, trembling. 

T he reporter watched the stars. 

Their positions were changing, 
he knew — relative to him, since he 
felt no movement — in the same 



manner as the minute hand on his 
watch. He knew it moved. He 
could see that it had moved, by 
looking away and counting and 
then looking back. But its actual 
motion was not quite visible. The 
stars moved the same way; they 
were there, immobile in appear- 
ance, but they weren’t where they’d 
been a few hours ago. Relative to 
their more distant companions. 
And to the observer. 

Tom gave the computer a veloc- 
ity figure of 56,820 mps. That fig- 
ure changed as the electronic brain 
figured its answer. He had keyed a 
tape answer in addition to the visu- 
al one — he read the tape, nodded, 
said “Mark,” and depressed a key. 
A black pointer swung across a 
dial, stopped at 112. The dial next 
to it indicated 24. The third regis- 
tered 54. The last gauge mentioned 
a figure too small to bother with. 

“Round to minutes,” Tom told 
his machine and Cal dutifully ze- 
roed ihe final dial and raised the 
one to its left to 55. Tom swung 
around in his padded chair. Doctor 
Bowers was looking at him, smil- 
ing, his head cocked. 

“One-hundred thirteen days, fif- 
ty-five minutes to lightspeed,” the 
computer technician said and the 
physicist nodded, looking down at 
the paper on his knees. His hand 
was damp; both pen and hand were 
heavy at just over two gravities 
constant acceleration. 

“Right,” he said and the report- 
er made a grinning note.

GALAXY 



“Doc’s kidding you, Tom,” the 
captain said. “Ask your friend if 
we can take the mass increase at 
steady acceleration.” Doctor Bow- 
ers jerked his head to stare quizzi- 
cally at the captain as the comp- 
tech turned and posed the question 
to Cal. 

A broad glastic screen just above 
Tom’s head glowed as its five- 
ounce electron tube beamed Cal’s 
answer on it: “E = mc^.” 

The captain chuckled. “Can’t 
fool old Cal,” he said. “From that 
answer I’d swear he has a sense of 
humor. He’s reminding me that 
sure our mass will increase, just as 
your pen will shorten. Doc. But 
since it’s all relative we won’t be 
aware of a thing. No sweat.” 

“Plenty of sweat,” the reporter 
said. “We’ve got to sit around and 
wait four months and a day. That’s 
a long sweat.” 

“I’m not worrying about the 
four months and a day,” Tom 
said. “But you can bet I’ll sweat 
those last fifty-five minutes!” 

T he stars crawled by. Dials 
moved. There were no days, no 
nights, no noons. Long ago Tom 
had set the computer to ring an 
alarm to remind them of lunch- 
time and dinner hour. Later he’d 
cut it off — it invariably interrupted 
a discussion or an argument or a 
game of chess or double-board 
Broadside. They ate when it was 
opportune, slept when they began 
to slur words and squint. On the 



one hundred and fifth day they 
were moving at one hundred seven- 
ty-six thousand miles per second. 
On the one-hundred eleventh day 
they watched the final three figures 
on the velocity gauge creep higher 
and higher. The first three read 
one-eight-five. 

They waited. Eyes strayed more 
and more frequently to the gauges. 

“Bingo,” the reporter said and 
Doctor Bowers jumped two inches. 

Heads snapped to the dials. 
Their velocity indicator ticked up 
to 186,000 miles per second. 

They made their bets, each tak- 
ing a different figure, no one 
choosing the accepted lightspeed of 
186,282. “Be damned if I’m not 
sweating,” the captain growled and 
the nervous laughter of his com- 
panions was their admission of the 
same fact. 

“We’ve got a few more hours. 
Bob,” the comptech said. “You’re 
one game up on me. Want to give 
me a chance to even the score?” 

The captain grinned. “No fair. 
I’m in no condition to play chess.” 

“Relative to someone on 
Earth,” you mean, Tom said, 
laughing. “Relative to me we’re 
even.” 

Again they laughed. Nervously. 

And waited. And watched the 
hour-clock die as had the day- 
clock. Their eyes ached as they 
watched the last pointer creep 
backward from fifty-five while the 
velocimeter crept forward. 

Tom began counting at ten. 

97 



ASK ASILLY QUESTION 




“Four- three- two- one- bingo!” 
His announcement was gratuitous 
— he turned from the computer to 
find the others watching the view- 
place and the gauges beneath it. 

Nothing happened. Their speed 
moved past 186,282 miles per sec- 
ond. Nothing happened. 

And then the stars vanished from 
the viewplate and all gauges swung 
back to zero. 

“My God!” 

“According to the old story,” 
the captain said drily — and quietly 
— “a voice is supposed to answer 
‘Yes?’ ” He went on — no one had 
smiled. “Very well. Exec.” His 
voice was stiff now. Military disci- 
pline had been used to dam panic 
before. “We have exceeded the 
speed of light and we have not been 
converted to energy and my mass 
feels pretty finite. The railroad 
tracks have not converged. You 
better confess to being wrong, kick 
Cal in the slats and then tell us the 
score.” 

“Aye sir.” Tom turned his chair 
to face Cal. He felt fantastically, 
sickeningly light. The pressure of 
acceleration was gone. He glanced 
back over his shoulder at the dead 
gauges and the blank viewplate. 
Then he asked his question. 

“Cal — have we exceeded the 
speed of light?” 

YES 

The television screen spelled out 
the word. Cal volunteered no infor- 
mation. It was because of the com- 
puter’s laconic responses that Tom 



had named it after a former presi- 
dent famed for his terseness. 

“What has happened to us. 
Cal?” 

NOTHING. 

“Like hell. Qualify!” 

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING HAS HAP- 
PENED TO YOU OR TO THIS SHIP. 

“All right then, dammit, what 
has happened, period?” 

repeat: nothing has happened 

TO YOU OR SHIP OR CAL. SHIP HAS 
SUCCESSFULLY EXCEEDED LIGHT- 
SPEED. REST OF UNIVERSE HAS VAN- 
ISHED. 

“Good god!” the reporter 
gasped. 

“My sentiments exactly,” the 
captain said. “Cal has been right 
all along: ‘Insufficient data. Warn- 
ing.’ He couldn’t tell us about this 
until we asked him and we didn’t 
know how to ask the question. 
Well. Try asking Cal where the 
universe is, Tom.” 

Tom did. 

INSUFFICIENT DATA. UNKNOWN. 

“Where are we. Cal? Tom 
asked and his machine chittered 
back at him like a happy squirrel. 

The answer flashed on the 
screen. The men stared at it, then 
at each other. Doctor Bowers had 
to smile. His smile became a 
chuckle, flowed into laughter. In a 
moment all four of them were 
laughing, the sound moving steadi- 
ly toward hysteria. The computer’s 
reply reiqained on the screen while 
Cal waiteif in vain for an answer. 

RELATIVE TO WHAT?

hood children we have here.”

ANNE MCCAFFREY’S The 
^Ship Who Sang is a pretty good 
adventure book. It’s published by 
Walker & Co. for $4.95, and its 
the story of Helva, the human per- 
sonality embedded in an interstel- 
lar spaceship. 

Now, I don’t normally review 
other reviewers, but Paul Tabori, 
author of The Green Rain and 
other science fiction non-land- 
marks, said something so incredi- 
ble about this book for one of the 
Chicago papers that I’m going to 
break a rule this one time. Dis- 
playing that insert of erudition 
which elevates a true critic above 
the mere hack. Professor Tabori 
told us all about the potted human 
beings once in vogue at certain 
royal courts and other centers of 
illumination around the middle of 
the second millennium. 



Infant people were placed in 
large earthenware jars for life and 
carried around from place to place 
to be a kind of portable T.V. They 
were educated, frequently enter- 
taining and witty — deponent know- 
eth not what alternative they had, 
except a quicker death — and some- 
how all this reminded Professor 
Tabori of Helva. I brought him in- 
to this review because I want to 
borrow his admittedly fascinating 
historical reference and discuss 
Helva as the antithesis of a captive 
brain. Helva is, in fact. Wonder 
Woman. She can do anything ex- 
cept get felt, and she doesn’t have 
to be very smart. Nor is she. 

She has talent — she sings. She 
has emotions — expressed in terms 
of purest soap opera, because she 
cannot gesture or show any other 
form of expression, and therefore 



102 




has to pour it all into the one chan- 
nel of her unsubtle verbal appara- 
tus, (as distinguished from a su- 
perb set of vocal cords). 

Unlike a human being set in a 
jar, able to command his environ- 
ment only through the exercise of 
wit and wile and able to achieve 
mobility only through persuasion, 
Helva has got the fully developed 
ability to go anywhere and do any- 
thing. In fact, the only control her 
masters actually have over her is a 
pretty well developed sense of in- 
hibition that she has acquired in 
the course of her education. And 
they do sweat and worry about 
what would happen if Helva, the 
super spaceship, ever decided to 
take off on her own. 

Well, she does and she doesn’t. 
She has numerous mind-affairs 
with the “brawns” who are her pi- 
lots. But of course she’s fully in- 
sulated from any physical contact 
and, as we’ve seen, in my opinion 
she’s not particularly capable of 
doing much with an opportunity 
for genuine emotion. 

She goes along shouting and 
singing and heaving great metallic 
sighs. She becomes famous 
throughout the galaxy of course, 
because unlike all the other ships 
like her, she does this peculiar 
thing — she sings. She’s a kind of a 
freak, you see.

in this field. She writes, as the say- 
ing goes, like an angel, and what 
she writes is always a treat. What 
she lacks as a plotter of commer- 
cial fiction can normally be seen 
only when one looks over the im- 
pressive array of really great com- 
mercial stories turned out by her 
and the late Henry Kuttner, when 
they were married and creating 
numbers of independent literary 
reputations for their various col- 
laborative pen names. 

The Kuttner-Moore stories were 
really fantastically good. In part 
this was because their people had 
three dimensions and an engage- 
ment with life. Even roaring down 
the road to hell they did it with a 
gusto and a sense of their own 
worth. Yet at the same time the 
stories in which they displayed 
these traits were tightly plotted, 
well-paced presentations. 

In ordinary analytical parlance 
that latter trait is assumed to have 
been Kuttner’s contribution. Still, 
C.L. Moore working under her 
solo byline is also the author of 
stories like No Woman Born and 
the novel Judgement Night. No 
one with these masterpieces in her 
repertoire can be said to be any- 
thing less than, superb as a com- 
mercial writer in all respects. 

But if you would like to see 
what can be done with superb 
storytelling ability and an as yet 
not fully developed sense of plot, 
then Jirel of Joiry is your girl. 
This book (Paperback Library 



)^63-166, 60<t) compiles five pre- 
Kuttner stories by C.L. Moore 
from the 1930s Weird Tales. The 
latest date is 1939, the earliest is 
1934. 

Each of these sword-and-sorcery 
stories devotes about 10,000 words 
to advancing a plot which would 
suffice for one well developed 
paragraph under most circum- 
stances as they are understood to- 
day and as they were even better 
understood a score of years ago. 
But Jirel of Joiry lives on despite 
the forty-five intervening years 
since her creation. It may not 
make a hell of a lot of sense for a 
slim redhead to have been a feudal 
tiger but C.L. Moore makes it 
make sense. She does it by substi- 
tuting observation for action. In- 
stead of advancing the plot, the 
events which occur to Jirel, as she 
struggles with the half-understood 
forces of darkness in her quasi- 
medieval world, are all things that 
play on the heart of what being 
you and me is all about. When she 
inflicts horror on her lover she 
knows what she has done. She goes 
out and atones for it, and they 
don’t live happily ever after. But 
at least their souls are at peace, 
which is a pretty good concept 
when you come right down to it, 
and the reason why this is still a 
good book, and why the young 
Catherine Moore is still one heck 
of a worker even though there have 
been later and even more skillful 
editions. ★

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 

“I’m sure it is. But you must be 
more careful going to and from 
work. I don’t mean just stay out 
of Abandoned Zones. Dressed the 
way you dress and looking as you 
do, you are in danger anywhere. 
Don’t you realize it? Doesn’t your 
husband know it?’’ 

“Oh. I’m careful, sir; I know 
what can happen, I see the news. 
But I’m not afraid. I’m carrying 
three unregistered illegal weapons 
— and know how to use them. 
Boss got them for me and had his 
guards train me.’’ 

“Hmm. As an officer of the 
court I should report you. As a 
human being who knows what a 
deadly jungle this city is I applaud 
your good sense. If you really do 
know how to use them. If you have 
the courage to use them promptly 
and effectively. If, having defended 
yourself, you’re smart enough to 
get away fast and say nothing to 
cops. That’s a lot of ifs, dear.”

“Very well, I am. Privileged. Go

Joe wasn’t home. Didn’t worry 
me. I’ve made donations at night 
many times and often alone. I

know that old, old hospital on the

“I’m afraid not.” ! 

“No matter. It’s old, built be- 
fore the government gave up try- 
ing to guarantee safety in the 
streets. No vehicle lift, no indoor 
parking. Just a lot with a fence and 
a guard at the gate. Happened 
when I came out. This frog tried 
to hop me between the parked cars. ' 
Don’t know whether tie was after j 
my purse. Or me. Didn’t wait to 
find out — don’t even know if it 
was a man, could have been a 
woman — ” 

“Unlikely.” 

“As may be. Stun bomb in his 
face with my left hand as I zapped 
with my right and didn’t wait to 
see if he was dead. Buzzed out of 
there and straight home. Never ■ 
told the police, never told Joe, 
never told anybody until just now.” 
(But it took a triple dose of Nar- 
cotol to stop your shakes, didn’t 
it, dearie — oh, shut up, that’s not ! 
the point.) 

“So you’re a brave girl and can 
shoot if you have to. But you are 
a silly girl, too, and very lucky. ^ 
Hmm. Johann has an armored car 
much like this and two shifts of 
guards to go with it.” 

“Of course he has guards, sir. 

I know nothing about his cars.” 

“He has a Rolls-Skoda. Eunice, 
we are no longer going to depend 
on how fast you are with weapons. 
You can sell your Gadabout or 
plant flowers in it; from here on 
you’ll have mobile guards and an 
armored car. Always.” 

M rs. Branca looked startled. 

“But, Mr. Salomon! Even with 
my new salary 1 couldn’t begin 
to—”

“Switch off, dear. You know 
that Johann will never again ride in 
a car. Chances are he will never 
leave that room. But he still owns 
his personal defense car; he still 
keeps a double crew, two drivers, 
two shotguns — and maybe they 
run an errand once a week. Eating 
their heads off and playing pinoch- 
le the rest of the time. Tomorrow 
morning my car will pick you up; 
tomorrow afternoon your own car 
— Johann’s — will take you home. 
And will be on call for you at all 
other times, too.” 

“I’m not sure Boss is going to 
like this.” 

“Forget it. I’m going to chew 
him out for letting you take risks. 
If he gives me any back talk, he’ll 
find I have enough chips to hire 
you away from him. Be sensible, 
Eunice; this doesn’t cost him a 
dollar; it’s a business expense that 
he is already incurring. Change of 
subject. What do you think of his 
plans for this soi-disant warm 
body?” 

“Is a brain transplant possible? 
Or is he grabbing at a straw? I 
know he’s not happy tied down to 
all that horrid machinery — good- 
ness, I’ve been combing the shops 
for the naughtiest styles I can find 
but it gets harder and harder to get 
a smile out of him. Is it practical, 
this scheme?” 

“That’s beside the point, dear. 
He’s ordered it and we are going 
to deliver. This Rare Blood Club 
—does it have all the AB-Nega- 
tives?” 

“Heavens, no. The last club re- 
port showed less than four thou- 
sand AB-Negs enrolled out of a 
probability of about a million.”

“Too bad. What do you think 
of his notion of page ads and 
prime time on video?” 

“It would cost a dreadful lot of 
money. But I suppose he can af- 
ford it.” 

“Certainly. But it stinks.” 

“Sir?” 

“Eunice, if this transplant is to 
take place, there must be no pub- 
licity. Do you remember the fuss 
when they started freezing people? 
No, you’re too young. It touched 
a bare nerve which set off loud 
howls and the practice was very 
nearly prohibited — on the theory 
that, since most people can’t af- 
ford it, no one should be allowed 
to have it. The Peepul, bless ’em — 
our country has at times been a 
democracy, an oligarchy, a dicta- 
torship, a republic, a socialism, 
and mixtures of all of those, with- 
out changing its basic constitution, 
and now we are a de facto anarchy 
under an elected dictator even 
though we still have laws and legis- 
latures and Congress. But through 
all of this that bare nerve has al- 
ways been exposed: the idea that if 
everyone can’t have something, 
then no one should have it. So 
what will happen when one of the 
richest men in the country adver- 
tises that he wants to buy another 
man’s living body — ^just to save 
his own stinking, selfish life?” 

“I don’t think Boss is all that 
bad. If you make allowances for 
his illness, he’s rather sweet.” 
“Beside the point. That bare 
nerve will jump like an ulcerated 
tooth. Preachers will denounce 
him and bills will be submitted in 
legislatures and the A.M.A. will 
order its members to have nothing

to do with it and Congress might 
even pass a law against it. Oh, the 
Supreme Court would find such a 
law unconstitutional I think — but 
by then Johann would be long 
dead. So no publicity. Does the 
Rare Blood Club know who these 
other AB-Negatives are who are 
not members?” 

“I don’t know. I don’t think so.” 

“We’ll check. I would , hazard 
that at least eighty percent of the 
people in this country have had 
their blood typed at some time. 
Does blood type ever change?” 

“Oh, no, never. That’s why we 
rares — that’s what we call our- 
selves — are so in demand.” 

“Good. Almost all of the popu- 
lation who have been typed have 
the fact listed in computers some- 
where, and with computers so in- 
terlinked today it is a matter of 
what questions to ask and how 
and where — and I don’t know how 
but I know the firm to hire for it. 
We progress, my dear. I’ll get that 
started and off-load the details on- 
to you, and then get other phases 
started and leave you to check on 
them while I go to South Amer- 
ica and see this butcher Boyle. 
And—” 

“Mr. Salomon! Bad turf com- 
ing up.” 

Salomon thumbed his intercom. 
“Roger.” He added: “Damn them. 
Those two beauties like to go 
through Abandoned Areas. They 
hope somebody will shoot so that 
they will have legal excuse to shoot 
back. I’m sorry, my dear. With 
you aboard I should have given 
orders to stay out of A.A.s no 
matter what.” 

“It’s my fault,” Mrs. Branca 
I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



said meekly. “I should have told 
you that it is almost impossible to 
circle near Nineteen-B without 
crossing a bad zone. I have to de- 
tour way around to reach Boss’s 
house. But we’re safe inside, are 
we not?” 

“Oh, yes. If we’re hit, this old 
tank has to be prettied up, that’s 
all. But I should not have to tell 
them. Rockford isn’t so bad; he’s 
just a Syndicate punk, an enforcer 
who took a fall. But Charlie — the 
one riding Shotgun — is mean. An 
XYY. Committed his first murder 
at eleven. He — ” Steel shutters 
slid up around them and covered 
the bulletproof glass. “We must 
be entering the A. A.” 

Inside lights came on as shut- 
ters darkened windows. Mrs. Bran- 
ca said, “You make it sound as if 
we were in more danger from your 
mobiles than from the bad zone.” 

He shook his head. “Not at all, 
my dear. Oh, I concede that any 
rational society Would have liqui- 
dated them — but since we don’t 
have capital punishment I make 
use of their flaws. Both are on 
probation paroled to me and they 
like their jobs. Plus some other 
safe — ” The rap-rap-rap of an au- 
tomatic weapon stitched the length 
of the car. 

In that closed space the din was 
ear-splitting. Mrs. Branca gasped 
and clutched at her host. A single 
explosion, still louder, went 
poungkl She buried her face in his 
shoulder, clung harder. “Got ’im!” 
a voice yelped. The lights went out. 

“They got us?” she asked, her 
voice muffled by the ruffles of his 
shirt. 

“No, no.” He patted her and 

107 





put his right arm firmly around 
her. “Charlie got them. Or thinks 
he did. That last was our turret 
gun. You’re safe, dear.” 

“But the lights went out.” 
“Sometimes happens. The con- 
cussion. I’ll find the switch for the 
emergency lights.” He started to 
take his arms from around her. 

“No, no! Just hold me, please — 
I don’t mind the dark. Feel safer 
in it — if you hold me.” 

“As you wish, my dear.” He 
settled himself more comfortably, 
and closer. 

RESENTLY he said softly, 
“My goodness, what a snuggly 
baby you are.” 



“You’re pretty snuggly yourself 
. Mr. Salomon.” 

“Can’t you say Jake? Try it.” 
“Jake. Yes, Jake. Your arms 
are so strong. How old are you, 
Jake?” 

“Seventy-one.” 

“I can’t believe it. You seem 
ever so much younger.” 

“Old enough to be your grand- 
father, little snuggle puppy. I sim- 
ply look younger ... in the dark. 
But one year into borrowed time 
according to the Bible.” 

“I won’t let you talk that way; 
you’re youngl Let’s not talk at all, 
Jake. Dear Jake.” 

“Sweet Eunice.” 

Some minutes later the driver’s 



108 




voice announced, “All clear, sir,” 
as the shutters started sliding down 
— and Mrs. Branca hastily disen- 
tangled herself from her host. 

She giggled nervously. “My 
goodness!” 

“Don’t fret, dear. It’s one-way 
glass.” 

“That’s a comfort. Just the 
same, that light is like a dash of 
cold water.” 

“Um, yes. Breaks the mood. 
Just when I was feeling young.” 

“But you are young — Mr. Sal- 
omon.” 

“Jake.” 

“Jake. Years don’t count, Jake. 
Goodness me, I got skin paint all 
over your shirt ruffles.” 



“Fair enough, I mussed your 
hair.” 

“My hair I can comb. But what 
will your wife say when she sees 
that shirt?” 

“She’ll ask why I didn’t take it 
off. Eunice, dear, I have no wife. 
Years ago she turned me in on a 
newer model.” 

“A woman of poor taste. 
You’re a classic, Jake — and clas- 
sics improve with age. Does my 
hair look better now?” 

“Lovely. Perfect.” 

“I’m almost tempted to ask to 
have us driven back into that bad 
zone so you can muss it again.” 
“I’m more than ‘almost 
tempted.’ But I had better take 




you home — unless you want to go 
with me over into Canada? Back 
by midnight, probably.” 

“I want to and I can’t, really I 
can’t. So take me home. But let 
me sit close and put your arm 
around me but don’t muss my hair 
this time.” 

“I shall be careful.” He gave 
his driver the coordinates of Mrs. 
Branca’s flat, then added: “And 
get there without going through 
any more Abandoned Areas, you 
trigger-happy bandits!” 

“Very good, Mr. Salomon.” 
They rode in silence, then Mrs. 
Branca said, “Jake . you were 
feeling quite young, just before we 
were interrupted.” 

“I’m sure you know it.” 

“Yes. I was ready to let you, 
and you know that, too. Jake? 
Would you like a skin pic of me? 
A good one, not one taken by that 
snoopy character who charges so 
much.” 

“Will your husband take one? 
Can you sneak me a copy?” 

“No huhu, Jake, dear. I have 
dozens of skin pix — I was once a 
beauty contestant, remember? 
You are welcome to one ... if 
you’ll keep your mouth shut 
about it.” 

“Privileged communication. 
Your secrets are always safe with 
your attorney.” 

“What do you like? Artistic? Or 
sexy?” 

“Uh . what a choice to have 
to make!” 

“Mmm, a pic can be both. I’m 
thinking of one of me in a shower, 
hair soaked, wet all over, not a 
speck of body paint, not even face 
makeup, not even—well, you’ll 

no 



see. Is that on your wave length?” 
“I’ll howl like a wolf!” 

“You shall have it. Quick 
change of subject; we’re almost 
there. Jake? Does Boss stand any 
chance with this brain transplant 
thing?” 

“I’m not a medical man. In my 
lay opinion — none.” 

“So I thought. Then he doesn’t 
have long to live whether he has 
the operation or not. Jake, I’m 
going to make still greater effort 
to dress even naughtier for him, 
as long as he lasts.” 

E unice, you are a sweet girl. 
There is nothing nicer you 
could do for him. Much better 
than saying thanks for this trust 
fund.” 

“I wasn’t thinking about that 
ridiculous million dollars, Jake, I 
was thinking about Boss. Feeling 
sorry for him. I’ll go shopping to- 
night for something really exotic 
— or if I can’t find a novel exotic, 
then a simple skintight see- 
through . passe but always ef- 
fective with the right paint job un- 
derneath — Joe is good at that. 
And — well, if I’m going to have 
guards now, some days I may 
wear nothing but paint — stilt heels 
to make my legs look even better 
— yes, I know they’re pretty — 
heels, a nylon minimum-gee and 
paint.” 

“And perfume.” 

“Boss can’t smell, Jake. All 
gone.”

“I still have my sense of smell.” 
“Oh. All right, I’ll wear per- 
fume for you. And paint for Boss. 
I’ve never tried anything that ex- 
treme at work . but now that 
we no longer work at his offices — 
no longer see many people — and I 
can keep a semi-see-through 
smock around, just in case — I 
might as well see if Boss likes it. 
Joe will enjoy thinking up provoc- 
ative designs, likes to paint me 
and is not jealous of Boss, feels 
sorry for the poor old man just as 
I do. And it is so hard to find nov- 
elty in exotic clothes. Even though 
I shop at least one night a week.” 
“Eunice.” 

“Yes, sir. Yes, Jake.” 

“Don’t shop tonight. That’s an 
order — from your boss by virtue 
of the power-of-attorney I hold.” 
“Yes, Jake. May one ask why?” 
“You can wear a paint-only job 
tomorrow if you wish — this car 
and my guards will deliver you 
like crown jewels. But I need the 
car tonight. Starting tomorrow 
you’ll have Johann’s car and 
guards and you will always use 
them for shopping. And every- 
thing.” 

“Yes, sir,” she said meekly. 

“But you are mistaken about 
Johann’s not having long to live. 
His problem is that he has too 
long to live.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“He’s trapped, dear, all joking 
aside. He’s fallen into the clutches 
of the medical profession and they 
won’t let him die. Once he allowed 
them to harness him into that life- 
support gear he lost his last 
chance. Have you noticed that his 
meals are served without a knife? 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



Nor even a fork? Just a plastic 
spoon.” 

“But his hands tremble so. I 
sometimes feed him. He hates to 
have nurses ‘messing around’ as 
he calls it.” 

“Think about it, dear. They 
have made it impossible for him to 
do anything but stay alive. A ma- 
chine. A weary machine that hurts 
all the time. Eunice, this brain 
transplant is just a way for Johann 
to outsmart his doctors. A fancy 
way to commit suicide.” 

“No!” 

“Yes. They’ve taken the simple 
ways away from him, so he’s had 
to think up a fancy one. You and I 
are going to help him do it, exact- 
ly the way he wants it done. We 
seem to have arrived. Don’t cry, 
damn it. Your husband will want 
to know why and you must not 
tell him. Do you feel like kissing 
me goodbye?” 

“Oh, please do!” 

“Stop the tears and turn up 
your pretty face; they’ll be unlock- 
ing us in a moment or two.” 

Presently she whispered, “That 
Was as good a kiss as the very first 
one, Jake . and I no longer feel 
like crying. But I heard them un- 
lock us.” 

“They’ll wait until I unlock 
from inside. May I go up the lift 
with you and see you to your 
door?” 

“Nnn ... I can explain your 
guards but would have trouble ex- 
plaining why the firm’s chief coun- 
sel bothers to do so. Joe isn’t jeal- 
ous of Boss — but might be of you. 
I don’t want him to be . espe- 
cially when I came so close to giv- 
ing him reason to be.”

“We could correct that near 
miss.” 

“Could be, dear Jake. My 
lowa-farm-girl morals don’t seem 
very strong today — I think I’ve 
been corrupted by a million dol- 
lars and a Rolls-Royce . and a 
city slicker. Let me go, dear.”

T he guards escorted her up and 
to her door in respectful si- 
lence. Mrs. Branca looked with 
new interest at Charlie, the Shot- 
gun — wondered how a mousy, 
fatherly little man could be as vi- 
cious as Jake seemed to know that 
he was. 

They “stood sideboy” as she 
spoke to her door’s lock, then 
waited until her husband unbolted 
it. As the door opened Rockford 
saluted and said, “Oh-nine-forty, 
miss — we’ll be waiting right here.” 
“Thank you, Rockford. Good 
night. Good night, Charlie.” 

Joe Branca waited until he had 
thrown the bolts and reset the 
alarm before he spoke. “What 
t’hell happen? An’ where you trap 
uniform apes?” 

“Don’t I get a kiss first? Surely 
I’m not all that late? It’s not yet 
eighteen.” 

“Talk, woman. Other ape shows 
back two hours with your jitter- 
buggy — tha’s okay; your boss’s 
butler phoned.” He took off her 
cloak and kissed her. “So where 
you been, dizzy baggage? Missed 
you.” 

“That’s the nicest thing I’ve 
heard all day. That you’ve missed 
me.”

“Walking the ceiling! What 
happen?” 

“Were you worried? Oh, dear!” 
“Not worried. Smith’s door 
flunky said you been sent on er- 
rand and ‘ud come home in a 
Brink’s. So kneA' you safe. Just 
torched it took so long when call 
made spec you’d short it. Roz- 
zei?” 

“Roz. Simple, though. Boss 
sent me with his Best Boy — Jake 
Salomon, you know.” 

“Fixer. Roz.” 

“Mr. Salomon took me in his ‘ 
car to his office to work on things 
Boss wanted at once — you know 
how right-now Boss is and worse 
since he’s been wired down.” 

“Poor old muck should take the 
Big One. Pitiful.” 

“Don’t say that, dear. I cry 
when I think about it.” 

“You’re a slob. Sis. But me, 
too.” 

“That’s why I love you, dear. 
Anyhow a longish job and Mr. 
Salomon had his guards take me 
home — and they drove through 
Bird’s Nest turf and we got fired 
on. Chopped all down one side.” 
“Huh? Doom?” 

“Not even grief. Fun.” 

“Like what inside?” 

“Terribly noisy. But exciting. 
Made me horny.” 

“Everything makes you horny, 
tits.” He grinned and mussed her 
hair. “You’re home and no aches, 
what counts. So peel. Inspiration 
eating me, whole day. Walking the 
ceiling!” 

“Which sort of inspiration, 
dearest?” she asked while sliding 
the half-sweater off her right 
shoulder and peeling it down her

arm. “And have you eaten? If you 
start painting, you won’t stop to 
eat.” 

“Ate some. Too high on inspi- 
ration. Big, big! I’ll flash a pack 
for you. Chicken? Spaghetti? 
Pizza?” 

“Anything. I’d better eat if it’s 
that sort of inspiration.” She 
kicked off her sandles, pushed 
down the panty-ruffle, sat on the 
floor to slide off the single tight 
attached to it. “Am I going to 
pose for a painting or are you go- 
ing to paint on me and mug it?” 
“Both. Tha’s the grabber. A 
Nova.” 

She laid her dress carefully 
aside, rocked forward into lotus 
seat. “I don’t roz it. ‘Both?’ ” 
“Both. You’ll see.” He looked 
down, ran his eyes over her, 
smiled. “And both sorts inspira- 
tion. 

“Well! Happy-making!” 

“Not too Wngry? Can wait.” 
“Beloved man, when was I ever 
that hungry? Never mind the bed; 
just grab a pillow and come here!” 
Shortly Mrs. Branca was think- 
ing happily how lucky it was that 
she had not let dear Jake go ahead 
— the sweet thing would have been 
a disappointment compared with 
what she had at home ... yet he 
had got her wonderfully primed 
for this. Really, it was best to be 
a faithful wife. Usually. What a 
wonderful, extraordinary day! 
Should she tell Joe about her big 
pay raise? No hurry. Couldn’t tell 
him anything else. Too bad. Then 
she quit thinking coherently. 

Some time later she opened her 
eyes and smiled up at him. “Thank 
you, beloved.”

- “Good vibes?” 

“Just what Eunice needed. At 
times like this I’m convinced that 
you’re Michelangelo.” 

He shook his head. “Not old 
Mike. Boys his jolly. Picasso 
maybe.” 

She hugged him. “Anyone you 
want to be, darling, as long as you 
go on being mine. All right. I’ll 
pose now, and eat at the breaks.” 
“Forgot. Letter from Mama. 
Read?” 

“Certainly, darling. Let me up 
and find it.” 

H e fetched it, still unopened. 

She sat up and glanced through 
it to see how much editing it 
would require. Un-hah, just as you 
expected, dearie, the periodic 
threat to come pay us “a nice long 
visit.” Well, she knew how to deal 
with that. Out! Because Joe did 
not know how to refuse his mother 
anything. That one visit had been 
one too many — yet that had been 
when they had had two rooms, be- 
fore she had found this wonderful 
one-big-everything studio room 
for Joe. Let that clinging old bag 
move in? No more jolly romps on 
the floor? No, Mama Branca. I 
will not let you ruin our happy 
nest with your smothering pres- 
ence. You stay where you are and 
live on Welfare . and I’ll send 
you a check from time to time 
and let you think it’s a present 
from Joe. But that’s all\ 
“Anything?” 

“The usual, dearest. Her stom- 
ach still bothers her but the priest 
sent her to another doctor and 
she’s doing better, she says. But 
let me start at the beginning. ‘My 

113 




darling Baby Boy, Not much news 
since last time Mama wrote but if 
I don’t write I don’t never get a 
letter back. Tell Eunice to write 
a longer letter this time and tell 
me everything that’s happening to 
you; a mother worries so. Eunice 
is a very nice girl even though I do 
think you would be better off with 
a girl of your own religion — ’ ” 

“Enough.” 

“Be tolerant, Joe. She’s your 
mother. I don’t mind and I will 
take time — tomorrow — to write 
her a long letter. I’ll send it by 
Mercury in the company pouch 
so that she will be sure to get it; 
Boss doesn’t mind. All right. I’ll 
skip the rest of that; we know what 
she thinks of Protestants. Or ex- 
Protestants. 1 wonder what she 
would think if she heard us chant- 
ing Om Mani Padme — ” 

“Kark her drawers.” 

“Oh, Joe!” She skipped, includ- 
ing the self-invitation. “ ‘Angela is 
going to have another baby. The 
Visitor is sore at her but I gave the 
Visitor a piece of my mind and I 
guess that learned her not to mis- 
treat decent people. I can’t see 
why they can’t just leave us alone. 
What’s wrong with having a baby?’ 
Which of your sisters is Angela, 
Joe?” 

“Third one. Visitor’s right. Ma- 
ma’s wrong. Don’ read alt, tits. 
Just read and tell.” 

“Yes, dear. Nothing more, 
really, just gossip about neighbors, 
remarks about the weather. The 
actual news is that your mother’s 
stomach is better and Angela is 
pregnant. Give me a moment to 
shower this red and black off — 
Boss liked the combo, by the way 

114 



— and I’ll be ready to be painted 
or to pose or whatever. You can 
flash a pizza for me while I get 
clean and I’ll gnaw it between 
times. And, dear? I shouldn’t pose 
later than midnight and I’d be aw- 
fully pleased if you would get up 
when I do tomorrow — rather 
early. I’m afraid. But you can go 
back to bed.” 

“So?” 

“For Boss, dearest. To cheer 
him up.” She explained her idea 
of full-paint costume alternated 
with erotic styles. 

He shrugged. “Glad to. Why 
gee-string? Silly. Old man dying, 
let him look. Can’t hurt.” 

“Because, dear. Boss prides 
himself on being ‘modern’ and 
‘keeping up with the times.’ But 
the truth is he formed his ideas so 
tong ago that nakedness wasn’t 
just uncommon, it was a sin. He 
thinks I’m a nice girl from so far 
back in the cornstalks that I’ve 
never been touched by the changes. 
As long as I wear a minimum-gee 
— and paint and shoes — I’m 
dressed, not naked. By his ‘mod- 
em’ standards, I mean. A nice girl 
pretending to be naughty to amuse 
him. Which he likes.” 

He shook his head. “No roz.” 
“Oh, but you do, dear. Symbol- 
ism, as you have explained to me 
about art. But it has to be Boss's 
symbols. Nudity doesn’t mean a 
thing to our generation. But it 
does to Boss. If I leave off that 
scrap of nylon, then by his sym- 
bols I’m not just a sweet girl, 
naughty-but-nice; I’m a whore.” 
“Whores okay. Angela one.” 

A clumsy one, she said under 
her breath. “Sure they are. But

not to Boss. The hard part is to 
guess what his symbols are. I’m 
twenty-eight and he’s over ninety 
and I can’t possibly roz his mind. 
If I push it too far, he might be 
angry — even very angry; he might 
fire me. Then what would we do? 
We’d have to give up this lovely 
studio.” 

Still in lotus, she looked 
around. Yes, lovely. Aside from 
the Gadabout parked near the 
door and the bed in the corner all 
the rest was the colorful clutter of 
an artist’s studio, always changing 
and always the same. The steel 
grid over the high north windows 
made a pretty pattern — and was 
so strong that she never worried. 
She felt warm and safe and happy 
here. 

“Eunice my darling — ” 

She was startled. Joe used 
short-talk so habitually that she 
was always surprised when he 
chose to shift idiom, even though 
he could use formal English as 
well as she could — well, almost, 
she corrected . but he was quite 
grammatical for a man who had 
had only a high school practical 
curriculum. “Yes, dearest?” 

“I roz it perfectly. Wasn’t sure 
you did. Just testing, beautiful. 
Not ninety myself but any artist 
understands figleaf symbol. Could 
happen you crowd Mr. Smith’s 
symbols too hard, don’ know. But 
we’ll do it. Figleaf so that his mind 
can lie to itself — no, no, mustn’t 
touch; Mama spank — then I paint

“Oh, good!” 

“But never worry about job.

it, who cares? Broke don’t scare 
me.” 

(It scares me, dear!) “I love 
you, darling.” 

“But we do it for nice old boy 
dying, not to save studio. Under- 
stand?” 

“Roz indeed! Joe, you’re the 
nicest husband a girl ever had.” 



H e DID not answer and got a 
pained scowl, which she recog- 
nized as birth pangs of creativity. 
So she kept still. Presently he 
sighed, “Down off ceiling. Prob- 
lem what to do for Boss solves in- 
spiration that put me up there. 
Tomorrow you’re a mermaid.” 
“All right.” 

“And tonight. Upper body sea- 
green with rosy glow showing 
through on lips and cheeks and 
nipples. Lower body golden fish 
scales blending at waist. Undersea 
background with sunlight filtering 
down. Traditional seabottom sym- 
bols, romantic. But upside down.” 
She hesitated. “So?” (Hard to 
know when to ask, when to keep 
quiet, when Joe was creating.) 

He smiled. “Fool-the-eye. 
You’re swimming. Diving straight 
down to bottom, back arched, hair 
streaming, toes pointed — main 
light dapple-scrimmed for water.

off, then oil you. But you see, I 
see, everybody see what happen to 
girls who paint too much. Pimples, 
blackheads, itching, scratching — 
ugly. Sure, we’ll paint you for 
Boss from ears to toes — but not 
too often and scrub you minute

you come home. That’s official.” 
“Yes, sir.” 

“So scrub jet and scarlet off, 
while I flash pizza.” 

A few minutes later she shut off 
the shower and called out through 
the door of the bath unit: “What 
did you say?” 

“Forgot. Big Sam stopped by. 
Pizza ready.” 

“Cut me a chunk, that’s a dear. 
What did he want? Money?” 

“No. Well, I let him have a fin. 
But stopped to invite us. Sunday. 
All day meditation. Gigi’s pad.” 
She stepped out into the room, 
still toweling. “All day, huh? Just 
us four? Or his whole class?” 
“Neither. A Seven Circle.” 




“Swinging?” 

“Suppose so. Didn’t say.” 
“Swinging.” She sighed. “Darl- 
ing, I don’t mind you lending him 
a five you’ll never see. But Big 
Sam is no guru, he’s just a stud. 
And a bliffy.” 

“Big Sam and Gigi share what 
they got, Eunice. And nobody has 
to swing. Ever.” 

“Theoretically, yes. But the 
only good way to break a Circle 
is never to join it. Especially a 
Seven Circle. Did you promise? I 
can grit my teeth and smile — ” 

“No. Told him had to see you, 
tell him tomorrow.” 

“Well? What do you want me 
to say, dearest?” 

“I’ll tell him no.” 

“Dearest, I don’t think you an- 
swered me. Is there some special 
reason you want us in this Seven? 
An art critic perhaps? Or a dealer? 
If it’s Gigi you have on your mind, 
why not ask her to model some 
daytime while I’m working? She’d 
be up here at once, her tail quiver- 
ing — I’ve seen her eyeing you.” 

He shook his head and grinned. 
'"Nyet, Yvette. Believe, lass — I 
stalled Big Sam because possible 
you wanted to join in. But Big 
Sam chills me, too — bad aura.” 
“Oh, I’m so relieved! I’ll swing, 
I promised you that when I asked 
you to marry me. And I have, the 
few times you’ve wanted to. And 
most were fun — only one struck 
me as boring. But 1 like to size up 
the players.” 

“Grab pizza, climb throne. 
Paint legs while you eat.” 

Y es, darling.” She mounted the 
model’s throne with a wedge of 



pizza in each hand; there followed 
a long period broken only by 
sounds of chomping, and low pro- 
fanity that punctuated his alter- 
nating pleasure and exasperation. 
Neither noticed. Joe Branca was 
deep in the euphoria of creation, 
his wife was immersed in the warm 
glow of being cherished. 

At last he said, “Down.” 

“May 1 look?” 

“No. Ribs and tits now. Don’t 
raise arms yet. Want to study.” 

“As if you didn’t know every 
wrinkle.” 

“Shut up. Want to think about 
how to paint ’em in morning.” 
Presently he said, “Been thinking 
maybe you crowd Boss too hard 
with only a gee-panty. Solved 
now.” 

“So?” 

"'Da. Paint a bra on you.” 

“But wouldn’t that spoil it, 
dear? Mermaids don’t wear bras.” 
“Was problem. Bad empathy. 
So use sea shells. Flat curved kind 
with nubbly backs. You know.” 
“Sorry but I don’t dear. Sea 
shells are scarce in Iowa.” 

“No matter. Sea shells fix bad 
empathy, symbols all match.” He 
grinned. “Pretty one, I’ll paint 
sea-shell bra cups so fool-the-eye 
that Boss won’ know for sure. 
He’ll spend day trying to see 
whether is real bra or just paint. 
If he asks — I win.” 

She gurgled happily. “Joe, 
you’re a genius!”

A S DR. BOYLE came oUt of 
the operating theater Mr. Salo- 
mon stood up.

“Doctor!” 

Boyle checked his impatient 
strides. “Oh. You again. Go to 
hell.” 

“No doubt I will. But wait a 
moment, Doctor.” 

The surgeon answered with con- 
trolled fury: “Listen, chum — I’ve 
been operating eleven hours with 
one short break. By now I hate 
everybody, especially you. So let 
me be.” 

“I thought perhaps you could 
use a drink.” 

The surgeon suddenly smiled. 
“Where’s the nearest pub?” 

“About twenty yards from here. 
In my car. Parked on this floor. 
Stocked with Australian beer, 
both cold and room temperature. 
And other things. Whisky. Gin. 
Name it.” 

“My word, you Yahnk bar- 
stahds do know how. Right. But I 
must change first.” Again he 
turned away. 

Salomon again stopped him. 
“Doctor, I took the liberty of hav- 
ing your street clothes packed into 
your bag and placed in my car. So 
let’s have that drink at once.” 

Boyle shook his head and 
grinned. “You do take liberties — 
too right. Very well, if you can 
stand the stink. I’ll tub and change 
at my hotel. ‘Lay on, MacDuff!’” 

Salomon let it go at that until 
they were locked into his car and 
he had poured beer for them — the 
authentic kangaroo kick for the 
surgeon, a much weaker American 
brew for himself; he had tangled 
with Australian beer in his youth 
and was wary. The big car started 
smoothly and continued so; Rock- 
ford had been warned that drinking 

I WILLFEAR NO EVIL 



might take place in the passenger 
compartment. 

Salomon waited until his guest 
had half a glass down him and had 
sighed in relief. “Doctor, how did 
it go?” 

“Eh? Smoothly. We had 
planned it, we rehearsed it, we did 
it. How else? That’s a good team 
you got for me.” 

“I take it you are saying the 
operation was successful?” 

“‘ — but the patient died.’ That’s 
the rest of the old saw.” 

Jacob Salomon felt a wave of 
sorrow and relief. He sighed and 
answered, “Well, I expected it. 
Thank you. Doctor. I know you 
tried.” 

“Slow down! I don’t mean that 
this patient died; I merely com- 
pleted the cliche. The operation 
went exactly as planned; the pa- 
tient was in satisfactory shape 
when I relinquished control to the 
support team.” 

“Then you expect him to live?” 

“‘It,’ not ‘he.’ That thing back 
there is not a human being and 
may never be. It won’t die, it can’t 
— unless one of your courts gives 
permission to switch off the ma- 
chinery. That body is young and 
healthy; with the support it is re- 
ceiving it can stay alive — as proto- 
plasm, not as a human being — for 
any length of time. Years. And the 
brain was alive when I left; it was 
continuing to show strong alpha- 
wave response. It should stay 
alive, too; it is receiving blood 
supply from that healthy body. 
But whether that brain and that 
body will ever marry into a living 
human being — what church do 
you attend?” 



119 




“I don’t.” 

“Too bad, I was about to sug- 
gest that you ring up God and ask 
Him, as / do not know. Since I 
saved the retinas and the inner ears 
— first surgeon ever to do that, by 
the bye, even though they call me 
a quack — it might be able to see 
and hear. Possibly. If the spinal 
cord fuses, it might regain some 
motor control, even be able to dis- 
pense with some of the artificial 
support. But I tell you the stark 
truth. Counselor, the most likely 
outcome is that that brain will 
never again be in touch with the 
outside world in any fashion.” 

“I hope your misgivings are un- 
founded,” Salomon said mildly. 
“Your contingent fee depended on 
your achieving sight, hearing and 
speech, at a minimum.” 

“In a pig’s arse.” 

“I’m not authorized to pay it 
otherwise. Sorry.” 

“Wrong. There was mention of 
a bonus, a ridiculously large sum 
— which I ignored. Look, cobber, 
you shysters are allowed to work 
on contingent fees; we butchers 
have other rules. My fee is for op- 
erating. I operated. Finis. I’m an 
ethical surgeon, no matter what 
the barstahds say about me.” 
“Which reminds me — ” Salo- 
mon took an envelope from his 
pocket. “Here’s your fee.” 

The surgeon pocketed it. Salo- 
mon said, “Aren’t you going to 
check it?” 

“Why should I? Either I was 
paid in full. Or I sue. Either way, 
I couldn’t care less. Not now.” 
“More beer?” Salomon opened 
another bottle of Down-Under dy- 
namite. “You are paid. In full, in 

120 



gold, in Switzerland — that enve- 
lope contains a note advising you 
of your account number. Plus an 
acknowledgment that we pay your 
expenses, all fees of assisting 
teams, all computer time, all hos- 
pital charges, whatever. But I 
hope, later, to pay that ‘ridicu- 
lous’ bonus, as you called it.” 

“Oh, I won’t turn down a gift. 
Research is expensive — and I do 
want to go on; I would like to be a 
respectable paragraph in medical 
histories . instead of being 
sneered at as a charlatan.” 

“No doubt. Not quite my own 
reason.” 

Boyle took a swig of beer and 
blinked thoughtfully. “I suppose 
I’ve been a stinker again. Sorry — 
I always come out of surgery in a 
vile mood. I forgot he is your 
friend.” 

S ALOMON again felt that bit- 
tersweet wave of relief and sor- 
row. He answered carefully, “No, 
Johann Smith is not my friend.” 
“So? I had an impression that 
he was.” 

“Mr. Smith has no friends. I am 
a lawyer in his hire. As such, he is 
entitled to my loyalty.” 

“I see. I’m glad you aren’t emo- 
tionally involved, as the prognosis 
on a brain transplant is never good 
— as I know better than anyone.” 
Boyle added thoughtfully: “It 
might work this time. It was a 
good tissue match, surprisingly 
good in view of the wide difference 
between donor and recipient. And 
identical blood type, that helps. 
We might luck it. Even disparity 
in skulls turned out to be no prob- 
lem once I could see that brain.” 

GALAXY 




“Then why are you gloomy?” , 
“Do you know how many mil- 
lions of nerve connections are in- 
volved? Think I could do them all 
in eleven hours? Or eleven thou- 
sand hours? We don’t try; we just 
work on the nerves of the head, 
then butt the raw ends of two spi- 
nal cords together — and sit back 
and spin our prayer wheels. May- 
be they fuse, maybe they don’t — 
and no one knows why.” 

“So I understood. What I don’t 
understand is how those millions 
of connections can ever take place. 
Yet apparently you were success- 
ful with two chimpanzees.” 
“Bloody! I was successful. Sor- 
ry. The human nervous system is 
infinitely inventive in defending it- 
self. Instead of reconnecting old 
connections it finds new paths — if 
it can — and learns to use them. 
Do you know the psych lab experi- 
ment with inverting spectacles?” 
“I’m afraid not.” 

“Some student has inverting 
lenses taped to his eyes. For a day 
or two he sees everything upside 
down, has to be led by the hand, 
fed, escorted to the Jakes. Then, 
rather suddenly, he sees everything 
right side up again; the brain has 
switched a few hundred thousand 
connections and is now interpret- 
ing the new data successfully. At 
this point we remove the spectacles 
from the volunteer chump — and 
now his bare eyes see the world 
upside down. So he goes through 
it a second time — and again the 
brain finds new paths and eventu- 
ally the images flip over again and 
he sees the world normally. 

“Something somewhat analo- 
gous to that happened to my two 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 





prize chimps, Abelard and Helo- 
ise. Nothing at first, thought I had 
still another failure. Then they 
started to twitch and we had to re- 
strain them to keep them from 
hurting themselves — motor action 
but no control. Like a very young 
baby. But in time the brains 
learned to manage their new 
bodies. Don’t ask me how; I’m a 
surgeon and won’t guess — ask a 
psychologist, they love to guess. 
Or ask a priest; you’ll get as good 
an answer and maybe better. Say, 
isn’t your driver chap taking us 
around the barn? My hotel was 
only five minutes from the medi- 
cal center.” 

“I must now admit to having 
taken another liberty. Doctor. 
Your luggage was packed, your 
hotel bill has been paid and all 
your things were moved to my 
guest room.” 

“My word. Why?” 

“Better security.” 

“That hotel seemed secure to 
me. Armed guards on every door, 
more armed men operating the 
lifts — I could not get in or out 
without showing my ID at least 
thrice. Reminded me of the army. 
Hadn’t realized what an armed 
camp the States are. Isn’t it rather 
a nuisance?” 

“Yes. But one grows used to it. 
Your hotel is safe enough, physi- 
cally. But the press are onto us 
now and they can get inside. And 
so can the police.” 

Boyle looked troubled but not 
panicky. “Legal complications? 
You assured me that all that sort 
of thing had been taken care of.” 

“I did. It has. The donor was 
married, as I told you, and by' 

122 



great luck husband and wife had 
given pre-consent. We had a good 
many thousands of that blood type 
quietly signed up — and paid re- 
tainers — but we couldn’t predict 
that one would be accidentally 
killed in time; the statistical pro- 
jection did not favor it. But one 
of them was indeed killed and 
there were no complications — no 
insuperable ones,” Salomon cor- 
rected, thinking of a bag of well- 
worn Federal Reserve notes, “and 
a court permitted our action as 
‘useful and necessary research.’ 
Nevertheless, the press will stir up 
a storm and some other court may 
decide to look into it. Doctor, I 
can put you in Canada in an hour, 
anywhere on this planet in a day — 
even on the Moon without much 
delay. If you so choose.” 

“Hmm. Wouldn’t mind going 
to the Moon, I’ve never been 
there. You say my clothes are in 
your guest room?” 

“Yes. And you are most wel- 
come.” 

“Is there a tub of hot water 
nearby?” 

“Oh, certainly.” 

“Then I’ll ask for another beer 
and that hot tub and about ten 
hours sleep. I’ve been arrested be- 
fore. Doesn’t worry me.”

odor, touch — and always surreal- 
istic which he never noticed. They 
flowed through him, or he through 
them, with perfect logic. To him. 

Meanwhile the world flowed on 
around him — and forgot him. 
The attempt at transplanting a liv- 
ing brain offered opportunity for 
much loose talk by video com- 
mentators, plus guest “experts” 
who were encouraged to add their 
own mixture of prejudice, specula- 
tion and bias in the name of 
“science.” A judge in need of pub- 
licity issued a warrant for the ar- 
rest of “Dr. Lyndon Doyle (sic) 
but Dr. Lindsay Boyle was outside 
jurisdiction before the warrant was 
signed and long before the name 
was straightened out. A famous 
and very stylish evangelist pre- 
pared a sermon denouncing the 
transplant, using as a text “Vanity 
of Vanities.” 

But on the third day a spectacu- 
lar and unusually bloody political 
assassination crowded Johann 
Smith out of the news and the 
evangelist found that he could use 
the sermon by changing a few sen- 
tences — which he did, understand- 
ing instinctively the American lust 
for the blood of the mighty. 

As usual, the unlicensed birth 
rate exceeded the licensed rate 
while the abortion rate exceeded 
both. Upjohn International de- 
clared an extra dividend. The 
backing and filling for the upcom- 
ing Presidential campaign speeded 
up with a joint announcement by 
the national committees of the two 
conservative parties, the SDS and 
the PLA, that they would hold 
their conventions together (while 
preserving mutual autonomy) for 

GALAXY 




the (unannounced but understood) 
purpose of re-electing the incum- 
bent. The chairman of the extreme 
left-wing Constitutional Libera- 
tion Rally denounced it as a typi- 
cal crypto-fascist capitalistic plot 
and predicted a November victory 
for Constitutional freedom. The 
splinter parties, Democratic, So- 
cialist, and Republican, met quiet- 
ly (few members and almost no 
delegates under sixty-five) and 
stole away without causing more 
than a ripple in the news. 

In the Middle East an earth- 
quake killed nine thousand people 
in three minutes and brought close 
the ever-present possibility of war 
through disturbing the balance of 
terror. The Sino-American Lunar 
Commission announced that the 
Lunar colonies were now 87% self- 
sufficient in proteins and carbo- 
hydrates, and raised the subsidized 
out-migration quota but again re- 
fused to relax the literacy require- 
ment. 

Johann Sebastian Bach Smith 
dreamed on. 

A fter an unmeasured time 
(how measure a dream?) Smith 
woke enough to be aware of him- 
self — the reflexive self-awareness 
of waking as contrasted with the 
unquestioning and unexplicit self- 
experience of dreaming. He knew 
who he was, Johann Sebastian 
Bach Smith, a very old man — not 
a baby, not a boy, not any of his 
younger selves — and was aware of 
his sensory surroundings, which 
were zero: darkness, silence, ab- 
sence of any physical sensation, 
not even pressure, touch, kinesthe- 
sia. 

1 WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



He wondered if the operation 
had started and what it would feel 
like when he died. He did not wor- 
ry about pain; he had been assured 
that the brain itself had no pain 
receptors and that he was being 
anesthetized solely to keep him 
quiet and unworried while the job 
was done — besides, pain had not 
worried Smith in years; it was his 
constant companion, almost an 
old friend. 

Presently he went back to sleep 
and to more dreams, unaware that 
his brain-wave pattern was being 
monitored and had caused great 
excitement when change in rhythm 
and peak had shown that the pa- 
tient was awake. 

Again he was awake and this 
time gave thought to the possibili- 
ty that this nothingness was death. 
He considered the idea without 
panic, having come to terms with 
death more than a half century 
earlier. If this was death, it was 
neither the heaven he had been 
promised as a child, nor the hell he 
had long since ceased to believe in, 
nor even the total lack of self he 
had corn* to expect — it was just 
one damn big bore. 

He slept again, unaware that the 
physician in charge of his life-sup- 
port team had decided that the pa- 
tient had been awake long enough 
and had slowed his breathing and 
made a slight change in his blood 
chemistry. 

He woke again and tried to take 
stock of the situation. If he was 
dead— and there seemed no longer 
reason to doubt it — what did he 
have left and how could he cut his 
losses? Assets: none. Correction: 
one asset, memory. He had a re- 

125 




cent memory-of-a-memory, vague 
and undefined, of confused and 
crazy dreams — probably from an- 
esthesia and no use to him — plus 
other memories older but much 
sharper of being (or having been) 
Johann Smith. Well, Johann you 
old bastard, if you and me are go- 
ing to have to spend all eternity 
locked in this limbo we had better 
get to work on total recall of 
everything we ever did. 

Everything? Or concentrate on 
the good parts? No, a stew had to 
have salt or it was too bland. Try 
to remember all of it. If we have 
all eternity with nothing to play 
but this one rerun, we’re going to 
want to have all of it on tap . 



as even the best parts may get bor- 
ing after a few thousand times. 

Still, it wouldn’t hurt to con- 
centrate — ^just for practice — on 
some exceptionally pleasant mem- 
ory. So what’ll it be, partner? 
There are only four top subjects, 
the rest are sideshows: Money, 
sex, war, and death. So which do 
we choose? Right! You’re correct, 
Eunice; I’m a dirty old man and 
my only regret (and a sharp one!) 
is that I didn’t find you forty or 
fifty years back. When you were 
not yet a gleam in your father’s 
eye, more’s the pity. Tell me, girl,

bles could take charge of a lanky, 
too-eager, almost-virgin boy, 
steady him, lead him through it, 
make him enjoy it, let him know 
she enjoyed it — make him feel 
good about it afterward. 

God bless your generous soul,

Mrs. Wicklund! If you are lost 
somewhere in this darkness — for 
you must have died many years 
sooner than I did — I hope you re- 
member me and are as happy in 
remembering me as I am in re- 
membering you. 

All the details now — Your flat 
was right under ours. Cold windy 
afternoon and you gave me a 
quarter (big money then, a dime 
was standard) for going to the gro- 
cery for you. For what? How 
good is yoiir memory, you horny 
old goat? Correction: horny old 
‘ghost.’ What have I got left to be 
horny with? Never mind, I am — 
it’s up here. Doc. Half a pound of 
sliced boiled ham, a sack of russet 
potatoes, a dozen ranch eggs (sev- 
en cents a dozen then — my God!), 
a ten-cent loaf of Holsum bread 
and — something else. Oh, yes, a 
spool of sixty white cotton thread 
at the notions shop next to Gil- 
more’s drugstore. Mrs. Baum’s 
shop — two sons, one killed in War 
One and the other made a name 
for himself in electronics. But let’s 
get back to you, Mrs. Wicklund. 

You heard me bring my bike 
into the hallway and opened your 
door and I carried your groceries 
on through to your kitchen. You 
paid me and offered me hot cocoa 
and — why wasn’t I nervous about 
Mama? Pop at work and Mr. 
Wicklund, too; that figured — but 
where was Mama? Oh, yes, her 
sewing circle afternoon. 

So while I drank cocoa and was 
being polite, you cranked your 
Victrola and put on a record — uh 
— Margie, it was, and you asked 
me if I knew how to dance? You 
taught me all right — on the sofa.

LIFE-SUPPORT technician 
studied an oscilloscope, noted 
an increase in brain activity, con- 
cluded that the patient might be 
frightened and decided to tranquil- 
ize. Johann Smith slipped gently 
into sleep without knowing it — to 
the scratchy strains of a mechani- 
cal phonograph. He was “fox- 
trotting,” so she told him. He did 
not care what it was called; his 
arm was around her waist, hers 
was around his neck, her warm 
clean odor was sweet in his nos- 
trils. Presently she seduced him. 

After a long, ecstatic and utter- 
ly satisfying time he said, “Eunice 
honey, I didn’t know you could 
fox-trot.” 

She smiled into his eyes. “You 
never asked me. Boss. Can you 
reach past me and shut off the 
Victrola?” 

“Sure, Mrs. Wicklund.” 

VI 

J OHANN SMITH became 
aware that this limbo was no 
longer featureless — head resting on 
something, mouth unpleasantly dry 
and felt crowded, as if with the sort 
of junk a dental surgeon inflicts on 
his victims. There was still total 
blackness but not quite dead si- 
lence. A sucking noise — 

Any sensation was most wel- 
come. Johann shouted, '"Hey\ I 
lived through it\" 

Two rooms away the monitor- 
ing technician on watch jumped up 
so fast he knocked over his chair. 
“Patient’s trying to articulate! Get 
Dr. Brenner!” 

Brenner answered quietly over 
the voice monitor. “I’m with the 

GALAXY 




patient, Cliff. Get a team in here. 
And notify Dr. Hedrick and Dr. 
Garcia.” 

“Right away!” 

Johann said, “Hey, damn it! 
Isn’t anybody here?” The words 
came out as incoherent grunts. 

The doctor touched a wand 
speaker to the patient’s teeth, held 
the microphone hooked to it 
against his own throat. “Mr. 
Smith, do you hear me?” 

The patient mumbled again, 
more loudly and forcefully. The 
doctor answered, “Mr. Smith, I’m 
sorry but I cannot understand you. 
If you hear me, make one sound. 
Any sort but just one.” 

The patient grunted once. 

“Good, wonderful — you can 
hear me. All right, one sound by 
itself means Yes; two sounds mean 
No. If you understand me, answer 
with two sounds. Two grunts.” 
Smith grunted twice. 

“Good, now we can talk. One 
sound for Yes, two for No. Do 
you hurt?” 

Two grunts — “Uh . ko!” 
“Fine! Now we try something 
else. Your ears are covered and 
completely soundproofed; my 
voice is reaching your inner ears 
through your teeth and upper jaw- 
bone. I’m going to remove part of 
the covering on your left ear and 
speak to you that way. The sounds 
may be painfully loud at first, so I 
will start with whispers. Under- 
stand me?” 

One grunt — 

Smith felt gentle firmness as 
something pulled loose. “Do you 
still hear me?” 

“Uh . ko— ” 

“Now do you hear me?” 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



“Uh ... /co ... ah ... ee ... oh 
. ee . oo . ow!” 

“I think that was a sentence. 
Don’t try to talk yet. Just one 
grunt, or two.” 

Johann said, “Of course I can’t 
talk, you damned idiot!” Take this 
junk out of my mouth!” The vow- 
els came through fairly clearly; 
consonants were distorted or mis- 
sing. 

“Doctor, how can the patient 
talk with all that gear in the way?” 

Brenner said quietly, “Shut up. 
Nurse. Mr. Smith, we have an as- 
pirator down your throat to keep 
you from choking on phlegm, 
drowning in your own saliva. I 
can’t remove it yet, so try to be pa- 
tient. Besides that, your eyes are 
masked. Your eye specialist will 
decide when that comes off. I can’t 
— I’m the life-support specialist on 
duty at the moment, not the physi- 
cian managing your case; that’s 
Dr. Hedrick, assisted by Dr. Gar- 
cia. I can’t do much more than I 
have till one of them gets here. Are 
you comfortable? One grunt, or 
two.” 

One grunt — 

“Good. I’ll stay here with you. 
And talk to you if you want me to. 
Do you?” 

One grunt — 

“Okay, I will. You can talk with 
more than a Yes or No any time 
you wish. By spelling. I’ll recite 
the alphabet, slowly, and you stop 
me with one grunt when I reach a 
letter you want. And so on for the 
next letter, until it’s spelled out. 
It’s slow . but neither one of us 
is going anywhere. Want to try 
it?” 

One grunt — 



129 




“Good. I’ve had lots of practice 
at it; I’ve been on many a life-sup- 
port watch in which the patient 
could not talk but was awake and 
perfectly rational. As you are,” 
the doctor added, lying hopefully, 
one eye on the master oscillo- 
scope. “But bored, of course. Very 
bored — that’s the worst part for a 
patient in life-support; he’s bored 
silly, yet we can’t let him sleep all 
the time; it’s not good for him 
and sometimes we need his cooper- 
ation. All right, any time you want 
to spell anything, give three dis- 
tinct grunts and I’ll prove I know 
my abc’s.” 

Three grunts — 

“A . b . c . d . e . f — ” Jo- 
hann grunted at “r.” 

“ ‘R?” Dr. Brenner repeated. 
“Don’t bother to answer if I’m 
right. Okay, first letter is ‘r.’ A . 
b . c . d . ” 

The message read: “Right ear.” 
“Do you want the plug removed 
from your right ear?” 

One grunt — 

Carefully the doctor removed it. 
“Testing,” he said. “Cincinnati, 
sixty-six, Susannah. Are you hear- 
ing with both ears? Does my voice 
seem to move from side to side?” 
One grunt, followed by three 
grunts — 

“Okay, spelled message. A . b 
. c — ” 

Shortly the doctor said, “ ‘No- 
body’? Is that the first word of 
your message?” 

Double grunt — 

“All right. I’ll try again. A . b 
— ” He was interrupted by a series 
of grunts and stopped. “You don’t 
want me to spell again . yet 
‘Nobody’ is not the first word of 

130 



your message. But I would have 
sworn that I got it right. ‘Nobody 
— ’ Uh . hey! ‘No . body’ — 
two words?” 

One emphatic grunt — 

“Are you trying to tell me that 
you feel as if you had no body? 
Can’t feel it?” 

Grunt — 

“Oh! Of course you can’t feel 
it; you haven’t finished healing. 
But honestly,” the doctor went on, 
lying with the skill of long prac- 
tice, “your progress has been 
amazingly fast. Both speech and 
hearing so soon, that’s wonderfully 
encouraging. In fact you’ve just 
won a bet for me. Five hundred,” 
he went on, still lying, “and at that 
I demanded more than twice the 
recovery time you’ve shown. And 
now I’m going to double my win- 
nings by putting them back and 
betting that you’ll have full recov- 
ery of the use of your whole body 
in no longer time. Because this is a 
wonderfully healthy body you have 
even though you can’t feel it yet. 
Marvelous repair factor.” 

Triple grunt — Then the spelled 
message was: “How long?” 

“How long since your opera- 
tion? Or how long until you get 
the use of your whole body?” • 



D r. BRENNER was saved by the 
bell. He stopped reciting the al- 
phabet and said. “Half a moment, 
Mr. Smith; Dr. Hedrick has ar- 
rived. I must report. Nurse will 
stay with you — ^just let the patient 
rest. Nurse. This has been tiring.” 
Outside the door Dr. Brenner 
stopped the case-managing physi- 
cian, saying, “Dr. Hedrick, one 

GALAXY 




moment before you go in. You’ve 
checked the remotes?” 

“Certainly. Awake-normal, ap- 
parently.” 

“And rational, in my opinion. I 
have removed the central stopples 
from both ear pads and we have 
been talking, spell-and-grunt, kill- 
ing time until you — ” 

“I heard you on monitor, as- 
sumed you must have opened the 
ears. You take a lot on yourself. 
Doctor.” 

Dr. Brenner stiffened, then an- 
swered coldly, “Doctor — your pa- 
tient, conceded. But I was here 
alone and had to use my own judg- 
ment. If you wish me to leave the 
case, you have only to say so.” 
“Don’t be so damned touchy, 
young man. Now let’s go in and 
see the patient. Our patient.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

They went inside. Dr. Hedrick 
said, “I’m Dr. Hedrick, Mr. 
Smith, physician in charge of your 
case. Congratulations! Welcome 
back to our weary world. This is a 
triumph for everyone — and vindi- 
cation for a great man. Dr. Boy- 
le.” 

Three grunts — 

“You wish to spell a message?” 
One grunt — 

“If you will wait a moment, we 
will remove some items from your 
mouth and you can talk instead.” 
(With great good luck, Hedrick 
amended to himself — but I never 
expected the case to progress even 
this far. That arrogant butcher 
really is a great man. To my sur- 
prise.) “Would that suit you?” 

An emphatic grunt — 

“Good. Hand aspiration. Dr. 
Brenner. Adjust those lights, 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



Nurse. Monitor watch! Find out 
what’s keeping Dr. Feinstein.” 
Johann Smith felt hands working 
rapidly but gently, then Dr. Hed- 
rick said, “Let me check. Doctor. 
Very well, remove the jaw wedges. 
Mr. Smith, we will have to aspi- 
rate every few moments — I’d rath- 
er not have to force you to cough 
up fluid. Or go after it the hard 
way. But you may talk if you 
wish.” 

“ Aye-gaA-aye-Aay-dih !” 

“Slowly, slowly. You’re having 
to learn to talk all over again, like 
a baby. That same remark now — 
but slowly and carefully.” 

“By . God . I . made 
. it!” 

“You surely did. The first man 
in history to have his brain moved 
into a new body — and lived 
through it. And you will go on liv- 
ing. This is a fine body. Healthy.” 
“But . can’t . peal — feel — a 
damn . thing . from . chin . 
down.” 

“Lucky you,” said the Doctor. 
“Because we’ve got you restrained 
all over against the day — soon, I 
hope — ” but never, more likely, he 
added to himself — “when you will 
start feeling your entire new body. 
When that day comes you may 
jerk uncontrollably — if we don’t 
have you restrained. Then you’ll 
have to go to work and learn to 
control your body. Like a new 
baby. Practice. Possibly long and 
tedious practice.” 

“How . long?” 

“I don’t know. Dr. Boyle’s 
chimps made it rather quickly, I ' 
understand. But it might take you 
as long as it takes a baby to learn 
to walk. But why worry about that 

131 




now? You’ve got a new body, good 
for many, many years — why, you 
might be the first human being to 
live two hundred years. So don’t 
be in a hurry. Now rest, please — 
I’ve got to examine you. Chin 
screen. Nurse.” 

“The patient’s eyes are covered. 
Doctor.” 

“Ah, yes, so they are. Mr. 
Smith, when Dr. Feinstein arrives, 
we will see if he wants to expose 
your eyes to light today. In the 
meantime — uncover the patient. 
Nurse.” 

U NCOVERED, the new body 
was still mostly covered. A 
plastic corset “iron lung” encased 
the torso from chin to pubis; arms 
and legs were strapped and the 
straps cushioned; urethral and anal 
catheters were in place and se- 
cured; two blood vessels were in 
use, one for nourishment, the other 
for monitoring; four others were 
prepared for use but currently 
stopped off. Wires were here and 
there. The body inside this dismal 
mess could have been one that 
Michelangelo would have treasured 
but the assemblage of artifact and 
protoplasm could seem beautiful 
only to a medical specialist. 

Dr. Hedrick seemed pleased. He 
took a stylus from his pocket, sud- 
denly scratched the sole of the right 
foot — got the reflex he expected, 
got no response from Johann 
Smith, also as expected. 

“Dr. Hedrick?” came a voice 
from the bed console. 

“Yes.” 

“Dr. Feinstein is operating.” 
“Very well.” He indicated to a 
nurse that he wanted the body cov- 

132 



ered. “Did you hear that, Mr. 
Smith? Your ophthalmologist is in 
surgery, can’t see you today. Just 
as well, as you have had enough 
for one day. It’s time for you to 

*'^“No. You... do... it. My... 
eyes.” 

“No. We wait for Dr. Fein- 
stein.” 

“No! You. are. in. charge.” 

“So 1 am and your eyes won’t be 
touched until your specialist is pre- 
sent.” 

“Damn. ..you. Get. .Jake. 
Sal.o.mon!” 

“Mr. Salomon is in Europe, will 
be notified that you are awake, and 
he may possibly be here tomorrow. 
I couldn’t say. In the meantime I 
want you to rest. Sleep.” 

“Won’t!” 

“Ah, but you will.” Dr. Hedrick 
pointed to Dr. Brenner, nodded. 
“As you pointed out, 1 am in 
charge. Want to know what 1 am 
certain you will sleep? Because we 
are slowing your breathing rate and 
introducing into your blood stream 
a harmless drug that will insure 
that you do sleep. So goodnight, 
Mr. Smith, and again — my con- 
gratulations.” 

“Damn . your ... ins . insuf- 
fera — ” Johann Smith slept. 

Once he half roused. “Eunice?” 
(Right here. Boss. Go back to 
sleep.) He slept on. 



VII 

H I, JAKE!” 

“Hello, Johann. How do you 
feel?” 

“Mean as a fox with its tail in a 

• GALAXY 




trap except when these tyrants 
dope me with something that 
makes me sweetness-and-light in 
spite of myself. Where the hell 
have you been? Why didn’t you 
come when I sent for you?” 

“On vacation. First decent vaca- 
tion I’ve had in fifteen years. Any 
objections?” 

“Get your feathers down. You 
do have a nice tan. And taken off 
a little weight, too, I think. Okay, 
okay — though I don’t mind saying 
I was disappointed that you didn’t 
trot back for a day or two at least 
when 1 woke up. Hurt my feel- 
ings.” 

“Humph! You have no feelings. 
Never did.” 

“Now, Jake — I do so have feel- 
ings, just never was one for show- 
ing them. But, damn it, I needed 
you.” 

The lawyer shook his head. 
“You didn’t need me. I know why 
you thought you did. You wanted 
me to interfere with Dr. Hedrick’s 
management of your case. Which 
I would not have done. So I ex- 
tended my vacation to avoid use- 
less argument.” 

Johann grinned at him. “Always 
the sly one, Jake. Okay, I’ve never 
been one to fret about yesterday’s 
trouble. But now that you’re back 
— well, Hedrick’s a good doctor 
. but he’s high-handed with me 
when it’s not necessary. So we’ll 
change that. I’ll tell you what I 
want and you tell Hedrick — and 
if he balks, you can let him know 
that he is not indispensable.” 

“No.” 

“WhaJ do you mean, ‘No?’ ” 

“I mean No. Johann, you still 
require constant medical atten- 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



tion. I haven’t interfered with Dr. 
Hedrick up to now and the results 
have been good. I won’t interfere 
now.” 

“Oh, for Pete’s sake, Jake. 
Sure, sure, you have my interests 
at heart. But you don’t understand 
the situation. I’m no longer in a 
critical condition; I’m convales- 
cent. Look, here’s late news, im- 
portant. Know what I did this 
morning during physiotherapy? 
Moved my right index finger. On 
purpose, Jake. Know what that 
means?” 

“Means you can bid in an auc- 
tion. Or signal a waiter.” 

“Crab apples. Wiggled my toes 
a little, too. Jake, in a week I’ll be 
walking, unassisted. Why, I spend 
thirty minutes each day now with- 
out this lung thing, this corset . 
and when they put it back on me, 
it’s simply set to assist, if neces- 
sary. But despite all this wonderful 
progress. I’m still treated like a 
wired-up laboratory monkey. Al- 
lowed to stay awake only a short 
time each day — hell, they even 
shave me while I’m asleep and God 
alone knows what else; I don’t. I’m 
strapped down every minute that at 
least six people don’t have their 
hands on me for physio. If you 
don’t believe me, lift the sheet and 
take a look. I’m a prisoner. In my 
own house.” 

Salomon didn’t move. “I believe 
you.” 

“Move that chair around so that 
I can see you better. They’ve even 
got my head clamped — now I ask 
you, is that necessary?” 

“No opinion. Ask your doctor.” 
Salomon stayed where he was. 

“I asked you . because I’m 

133 




fed up with his top-sergeant be- 
havior.” 

“And I declined to express an 
opinion in a field in which I have 
no competence. Johann, you’re 
getting well, that’s evident. But 
only a fool replaces a quarterback 
who is winning. / never thought 
you would live through the opera- 
tion. I don’t think you did, either.” 

“Well . truthfully, I didn’t. I 
was betting my life— -literally — on 
a long gamble. But I won.” 

“Then why don’t you try being 
grateful? Instead of behaving like 
a spoiled child!" 

“Temper, Jake, temper — why, 
you sound like me." 

“God knows I don’t want to 
sound like you. But I mean it. 
Show gratitude. Praise the Lord — 
and Dr. Hedrick.” 

“And Dr. Boyle, Jake. Yes, I 
am grateful, truly I am. I’ve been 
snatched back from the edge of 
death — and now have every reason 
to expect a wonderful new life — 
and all I risked was a few more 
weeks of a life that had grown in- 
tolerable.” Johann smiled. “I can’t 
express how grateful 1 am, there 
are no words. My eyes are twenty/ 
twenty again and I’m seeing shades 
of color I had forgotten existed. I 
can hear high notes I haven’t heard 
in years. I get ’em to play sym- 
phonies for me and I can follow 
the piccolo clear up to the roof. 
And the violins. I can hear all sorts 
of high sounds now, higher than 
ever — even my new voice sounds 
high; he must have been a tenor. 
And I can smell, Jake — and I lost 
my last trace of a sense of smell 
years ago. Nurse, walk past me 
and let me smell you.” 

134 



The nurse, a pretty redhead, 
smiled, said nothing, did not move 
from the bed’s console. 

J OHANN went on, “I’m even 
allowed to eat now, once a day 
— eat and swallow, I mean, not a 
blasted tube. Jake, did you know 
that Cream o’ Wheat tastes better 
than filet mignon? It can. Hell, 
everything tastes good now; I had 
forgotten what fun it is to eat. 
Jake, it’s so grand to be alive — in 
this body — that I can’t wait to go 
out in the country and walk in 
fields and climb a hill and look at 
trees and watch birds. And clouds. 
Sunbathe. Ice-skate, maybe. 
Square-dance. Ever square-dance, 
Jake?” 

“I used to be good at it. No 
time for it, late years.” 

“I never had time for it even 
when I was young. I’m going to 
take time, now. Reminds me, 
who’s minding the store?” 

“Teat, of course. He wants to 
see you.” 

“You see him. I’m too busy 
learning to use my new body. And 
enjoying it. Do 1 have any money 
left? Not that I give a hoot.” 

“You want the ungarnished 
truth?” 

“You can’t scare me, Jake. If I 
have to sell this house to pay off 
this gang of jailers, it won’t worry 
me. Might be fun. I can tell you 
this: I’ll never be on Welfare. I’ll 
get by — always have, always will.” 
“Brace yourself. You’re worth 
more than ever.” 

“Huh? Oh, what a shame! When 
I was just beginning to enjoy be- 
ing broke.” 

“Hypocrite.” 



GALAXY 




“Not at all, Jake. I—” 
“Hypocrite, I said. Oh, hush 
up. Your fortune had already 
reached the take-off point, where 
it can’t possibly be spent no mat- 
ter how you try. It just keeps 
growing. I didn’t even spend all 
your income on this operation and 
all that went with it. However, you 
no longer control Smith Enter- 
prises.” 

“So?” 

“Yes. I encouraged Teal to bor- 
row money and buy some of your 
voting shares; it gave him incen- 
tive in ‘minding the store.’ And it 
looked better. Also, as de facto 
chairman of the board, I thought 
it would look better if I owned a 
bigger block, too, so I traded you 
some blue chips and tax-exempts 
for some of your senior-corpora- 
tion voting stock. At present two 
of us — you and I, or you and Teal 
— hold voting control. But no one 
of us. However, I’ll trade back any 
time you want to resume control.” 
“God forbid!” 

“We’ll leave the matter open, 
Johann. I was not trying to take 
advantage of your illness.” 

“No, Jake. If I don’t have con- 
trolling interest, I don’t have even 
a moral responsibility to look out 
for the company. I’ll resign as 
chairman of the board — and you 
can be chairman, or Teal, or you 
can put it up for grabs.” 

“Wait till you’re well.” 

“Okay, but I shan’t change my 
mind. But now about that other 
matter — uh. Nurse, don’t you 
have to go empty something, or 
wash your hands, or check the 
roof to see if it’s on tight? I want 
a private talk with my lawyer.” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



She smiled and shook her head. 
“No, sir. You know I can’t leave 
the room even a moment without 
being relieved. But Tm authorized 
by Dr. Hedrick to do this, sir; I 
can shut off the voice monitor to 
the remotes, then go over in that 
far corner and watch video with 
the sound turned up high so that 
you’ll be certain I can’t hear you. 
Dr. Hedrick said that you might 
want privacy in speaking with Mr. 
Salomon.” 

“Well! The old bug — bug-hunt- 
er is human after all. You do that. 
Nurse.” 

Shortly, Johann was able to say 
quietly, “You saw that, Jake? God 
knows there could be no harm in 
you alone watching me a few min- 
utes — you could call for help if I 
choked or something. Anyhow, 
any trouble would show on their 
dials. But, no, they chaperone me 
every second and won’t agree to 
the most harmless request. Look, 
very quietly now — do you have a 
pocket mirror on you?” 

“Eh? Never carried one in my 
life.” 

“A pity. Well, have one on you 
next time you’re in to see me. To- 
morrow, I hope. Jake, Hedrick is 
a good doctor, conceded — but he 
won’t tell me anything. Just this 
week I asked him whose body this 
had been — and he wasn’t even po- 
lite enough to lie; he just told me 
that it was none of my business.” 

“It isn’t.” 

“Huh?” 

“Remember the contract I 
worked out? It said — ” 

“Never read it. Your pidgin.” 

“I told you; you didn’t listen. 
Donor’s privacy to be respected 

135 




unless donor specifically grants 
permission to breach it . and 
even then his estate must confirm 
after death. In this case neither 
proviso was met. So you can never 
be told.” 

“Oh, rats. I can find out, once 
I’m up and around. I would never 
publicize it; I just want to know.” 

“No doubt you will find out. 
But I won’t be a party to breach- 
ing a contract with the dead.” 

“Hmm. Jake, you’re a stiff- 
necked old bastard; it wouldn’t do 
any harm. All right, all right. But 
get me that mirror. Look, you can 
get me one now. Go into my bath- 
room, usual excuse, and look 
around. Search. Four or five small 
mirrors in there, drawers and such 
— or were the last time I was on 
my feet. Almost certainly still are. 
Just don’t let a nurse see it. In 
your pocket. Or under your 
jacket.” 

“Why don’t you simply ask for 
one?” 

“Because they won’t let me have 
one, Jake. You may think I’m 
paranoid but I am being perse- 
cuted by this high-and-mighty doc- 
tor. Won’t let me see my new face 
in a mirror. Okay, it’s probably 
scarred; I don’t care. Won’t let me 
look at myself at all. When they 
work on me they put up a chin 
screen; I haven’t even seen my 
hands. Would you believe it, I 
don’t even know what color I am. 
Am I a soul? Or a honk? Or some- 
thing else? It’s maddening.” 

J OHANN, it might be literally 
maddening for you to see your- 
self. Before you have your strength 
back.”

“What? Oh, be your age, Jake; 
you know me better than that. If 
I’m the ugliest thing since wart 
hogs and covered with purple 
stripes, I can take it.” Johann 
grinned. “I was ugly as sin before 
the operation; any change for the 
worse can’t be great. But I tell you 
no lie, old friend; if they keep 
treating me like a retarded child, 
they really will drive me off the 
rails.” 

Salomon sighed. “I’m sorry to 
have to tell you this, Johann, but 
it is no news to me that they won’t 
let you see yourself in a mirror — ” 
“What?” 

“Steady down. I’ve discussed it 
with Dr. Hedrick and with the 
psychiatrist working with him. 
They are of the opinion that you 
could suffp a severe emotional 
shock — one that might give you a 
grave setback, even (as you say) 
‘drive you off the rails’ — if you 
saw your new self before you are 
fully well and strong.” 

Johann Smith did not answer at 
once. Then he said quietly, “Pig 
whistle. I know I’m physically 
something else now. What harm 
do they think it could do me?” 

“The psychiatrist mentioned the 
possibility of a split personality.” 
“Move around and look me in 
the eyes. Jake Salomon, do you 
believe that?” 

“My opinion is neither relevant 
nor competent. I am not going to 
buck your physicians. Nor help 
you to outwit them.” 

“So that’s how the wind sets. 
Jake ... I am sorry to be forced 
to say this — but you are not the 
only lawyer in this city.” 

“So I know. I am sorry — truly 

GALAXY 




sorry — to be forced to say this, 
Johann — but I am the only lawyer 
you can turn to.” 

“ What do you mean?” 

“Johann, you are now a ward 
of the court. I am your guardian.” 
Johann Smith was slow to an- 
swer, then barely whispered; “Con- 
spiracy. I never thought it of you, 
Jake.” 

“Johann, Johann!” 

“Do you mean to keep me 
locked up forever? If not, what’s 
the price to turn me loose? Is the 
judge in on it? And Hedrick?” 
Salomon controlled himself. 
“Please, Johann, let me speak. I’m 
going to pretend that you never 
said what you did say . and I’ll 
have a transcript of the proceed- 
ings brought here for you to see. 
Hell, I’ll have the judge himself 
fetch them. But you’ve got to lis- 
ten.” 

“I’m listening. How can I help 
listening? I’m a prisoner.” 

“Johann, you will cease being a 
ward as soon as you are able to 
appear in court — in person — and 
convince the judge — Judge Mc- 
Campbell, it is, an honest man as 
you know — convince McCampbell 
that you are no longer non com- 
pos mentis. He took the step re- 
luctantly — and I had to fight to be 
named your guardian, as I was not 
the petitioner.” 

“So? And who asked to have me 
committed?” 

“Johanna Darlington Seward, et 
alia — meaning your other three 
granddaughters, too.” 

“I see,” Johann said slowly. 
“Jake, I owe you an apology.” 
Salomon snorted. “For what? 
How can you do or say anything 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



calling for an apology when you 
are legally non compos mentisT' 
“Whew! Hand me the tradition- 
al pinch of snuff; that was razor 
sharp. Dear little Johanna — I 
should have drowned her at birth. 
Her mother, my daughter Evelyn, 
used to shove her into my lap and 
remind me that she was my name- 
sake. Jake, the only thing that brat 
ever did for me was to pee on my 
trousers — on purpose. So June and 
Marla and Elinor are in it, too. 
Not surprising.” 

“Johann, they darn near made 
it. I had to resort to everything 
short of treason to get it into 
Judge McCampbell’s court. Even 
then, only the fact that I have held 
your general power of attorney for 
an unbroken fifteen years kept the 
court from naming Mrs. Seward 
as guardian and conservator. That 
and one other thing.” 

“What other thing?” 

“Their stupidity. If they had 
shot for guardianship right off, 
they might have made it. Instead 
their first move was to try to have 
you declared legally dead.” 

“Well! Jake, do you suppose — 
later — that I can cut them out of 
my will entirely?” 

“You can do better than that; 
you can outlive them. Now.” 
“Mmm, yes, I suppose I can. I 
will! It’ll be a pleasure.” 

“That move wasn’t serious, just 
stupid. Stupid lawyer. Took four 
days for the expert witnesses to 
unwind, took the court four min- 
utes to rule in accordance with 
‘Estate of Parsons vs. Rhode Is- 
land.’ Hoped 1 had seen the last of 
them then; that diploma-mill shy- 
ster seemed pretty cowed. Then 

137 




Parkinson got into it . and his 
lawyer is not stupid.” 

“Parkinson? Our boy Parky, 
our idiot ex-director?” 

“The same.” 

“Hmm. Von Ritter was right; it 
doesn’t pay to humiliate a man. 
But how could Parky show an in- 
terest?” 

H e DIDN’T. That Parkinson 
put them up to it is simply a 
conclusion but a firm one — Park- 
inson’s mother-in-law’s lawyer and 
Parkinson himself present every 
day in court, a happy spectator. 
Johann, I didn’t dare ask that the 
matter be continued during your 
recovery; our own expert witnesses 
were unwilling to testify that you 
would ever be yourself again, able 
to manage your own affairs. So 
we stipulated your temporary lack 
of competence — surprised ’em, 
caught ’em unprepared — and I had 
our attorney move that I be ap- 
pointed your guardian pro tern. 
Made it. But, Johann, as soon as 
this was in the wind 1 started shuf- 
fling stock around. For several 
weeks Teal held a big chunk of 
your voting stock — Teal is okay; 
you made a good choice — Teal 
held all of your stock that I now 
hold, using money I lent him. An 
open transaction that could be ver- 
ified, none of this ‘ten dollars and 
other valuable considerations’ 
dodge. During that period, your 
stock that I had sold to Teal, us- 
ing my money plus Teal’s stock 
that he already had, plus what I 
have long held, was voting control 
. because I knew that if I lost, 
the next day Parkinson would show 
up with proxies for your stock — 

138 



signed by your granddaughters — 
and demand a stockholders meet- 
ing and kick me out of the chair 
and fire Teal as president. Yet I 
didn’t dare buy stock from you 
myself — or I would go into court 
as an interested party and the other 
side might sniff it. It was touch- 
and-go for a while, Johann.” 

“Well, I’m glad we’re out of the 
woods. Parky.” 

“We aren’t. Other actions com- 
ing up, none of which you need 
worry about today.” 

“Jake, I’m not going to worry 
about anything. I’m going to think 
about birds and bees and fleecy 
clouds and enjoy the wonderful 
taste of Cream o’ Wheat. And 
prunes, strained prunes fixed baby- 
style. I’m just glad to know that 
my oldest friend didn’t knife me 
while 1 was unconscious and sorry 
as hell I thought so even for a mo- 
ment. Oh, I still think you’re a 
timid, gutless, stinking sissy not to 
help me out on this mirror non- 
sense but we’ll argue that another 
day. I can wait if I have to; I see 
why you don’t want to buck a psy- 
chiatrist if I have to go into court 
when I’m up and convince Judge 
McCampbell that I can still hit 
the floor with my hat.” 

“I’m glad to hear it. And I’m 
glad to see that you are getting 
well, Johann. I’m certain you are 
since you are again, or still, the 
same stinking bad-tempered, un- 
reasonable old scoundrel you al- 
ways were.” 

Johann chuckled. “Thanks, Jake 
— and I see that you are in good 
health, too. May we never see the 
day we talk sweet to each other. 
What else is new? Oh, yes! Where 

GALAXY 




in hell is my secretary? Eunice, I 
mean. There is not a one of this 
gang of kidnappers around me 
who ever knew hef . and they 
show no interest in trying to find 
her. Oh, Garcia knew her by sight 
— but he says he doesn’t know 
where she is and claims he’s too 
busy to run errands. Told me to 
ask you.” 

“Oh.” Salomon hesitated. “Do 
you know her address?” 

“Eh? Somewhere at the north 
end of town. I suppose my accoun- 
tant has it. Wait a moment! You 
took her home once, I remember 
clearly.” 

“So I did. It was indeed some- 
where in the north end. But those 
rabbit warrens all look alike. My 
guards may know. Hold it — your 
mobile guards escorted her for sev- 
eral months, right up to the time 
you went in for surgery. Have you 
asked them?” 

“Hell, Jake, I haven’t been al- 
lowed to see anyone. I don’t even 
know that they are still working 
for me.” 

“I’m fairly sure they still were 
when I left for Europe. But, Jo- 
hann, while we can ask them, I 
doubt if it will do any good.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because I did see Eunice just 
before your operation. She was in- 
terested — she was fond of you, Jo- 
hann, much more so than you de- 
served — ” 

“Conceded! Make it march.” 

“Well, she didn’t mention speci- 
fic plans but I don’t think she in- 
tended to stay in secretarial work. 
Hell, man, none of us expected 
that you would ever need a secre- 
tary again. I would happily have 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



hired her myself; she is a good sec- 
retary. But — ” 

“I’m sure you would, you old 
goat. But surely you let her know 
that she could stay on my payroll 
forever? Well, until I died, at 
least.” 

“She knew that. But she is a 
proud girl, Johann. Not a parasite. 
I’ll make an effort to find her. 
However, if I don’t, there are 
many good secretaries. I’ll find 
one for you. That’s a promise.” 

“Look, I don’t want another 
secretary; I want Eunice Branca.” 

“I meant — ” 

“I know what you meant. You’d 
find me some old witch who does 
perfect work but is no fun to look 
at or have around . while you’ve 
probably got Eunice stashed away 
in your office.” 

S ALOMON said slowly, “Jo- 
hann, I swear by all that’s holy 
that I do not have her in my office 
nor anywhere.” 

“Then she did turn you down. 
Jake, I trust you with my life and 
all my worldly goods. But I don’t 
trust you or any man not to steal 
a perfect secretary if he can.” 

“Wo/o contendere. I did offer 
her a job any time she wanted it. 
She did not accept.” 

“So we find her. You find her.” 
Salomon sighed. “What clues 
can you give me? Her husband, 
perhaps? Isn’t he an artist?” 

“I suppose you could call him 
that. Look, Jake, don’t hold this 
against Eunice — but / would call 
him a gigolo. But I’m old-fash- 
ioned. I had to get a report when 
she married him. He was clean, no 
reason to lose the best secretary a 

139 




man ever had just because she 
chose to marry him. Yes, he was 
an artist, one who didn’t sell much; 
she supported him. That was her 
business; Branca was all right — 
didn’t use drugs, didn’t even drink. 
But he wasn’t up to her. Illiterate. 
Surely I know how common that 
is today; I’m not prejudiced. I’ve 
got illiterates right in this house — 
and only God and Accounting 
know how many are working for 
Smith Enterprises. Branca may 
never have attended a school in 
which reading is taught. But I can 
give you one lead — if Eunice is not 
working as a secretary — easy to 
check through Social Security — 
and if they aren’t on the Welfare 
rolls — she won’t be, he might be — 
then check model agencies, video, 
artists, photographers, et cetera. 
For both of them. For he was as 
handsome as Eunice was beautiful; 
the snoopshot with the security re- 
port made that plain.” 

“Very well, Johann; I’ll get a 
skiptrace firm on it.” 

“Hell, put a regiment of detec- 
tives on it!” 

“But suppose they dropped out? 
People do.” 

Johann sniffed. “Perhaps he 
would — I would lay any amount 
that she never would. But, if nec- 
essary, I want every Abandoned 
Area in this city combed.” 

“Expensive. You send a private 
detective into an A. A. and the 
premium on his life goes sky 
high.” 

“Didn’t you tell me that I have 
more money than I know what to 
do with?” 

“True. But I don’t relish hiring 
a man for hazardous work even if 

140 



he wants the job. But we’re bor- 
rowing trouble; it may take noth- 
ing more than getting Accounting 
to dig out that address. Or do a 
back check on a social security 
number with the customary small 
bribe. I’ll let you know.” 

Salomon stood up to leave. 
Smith said, “Hold it. Will I see 
you tomorrow? And will you 
phone in a report — tell Hedrick or 
the physician on watch; they won’t 
let me talk on the phone — phone a 
report each day? Till you find 
her?” 

“Every day, Johann.” 

“Thanks, Jake. You’ll make 
Eagle Scout yet. Tell nursy she 
can come out of the corner now. 
They’re probably waiting to slip 
me my Mickey Finn — this is the 
longest they’ve let me stay awake 
so far.” 

T WO rooms away Salomon 
stopped to speak to Dr. Hed- 
rick. The physician looked at him. 
“Rough,” he stated. 

“Quite. Doctor, how long do 
you expect to keep your patient 
from using a mirror?” 

“Hard to say. Progress has been 
rapid lately . but Smith still has 
very imperfect control of the new 
body. Plus tingling and itching and 
numbness — all to be expected — 
and imaginary pains. Psychoso- 
matic, rather; they are real to the 
patient. Counselor, if you expect 
me to have my patient ready for a 
competency hearing any time soon, 
emotional shocks must be delayed 
as long as possible. That’s my 
opinion, though, of course, I am 
strongly influenced by Dr. Rosen- 
thal’s judgment. Besides imperfect 

GALAXY 




body control, our patient is weak 
and emotionally extremely unsta- 
ble.” 

“So I am aware.” 

“Mr. Salomon, you look as if 
you needed another tranquilizer. 
May I?” 

Salomon grudged a smile. “On- 
ly if it involves grain alcohol.” 

Hedrick chuckled. “Will you 
settle for some bottled in Scot- 
land?” 

“Yes! No water. Well, just a 
touch.” 

“I’ll dispense the drug, you add 
water to taste. I’ll prescribe for 
myself, too — I also find this case 
a bit trying. Even though we are 
making medical history.” 

VIII 

R. GARCIA rubbed Jake Salo- 
mon’s arm where he had just 
injected him. “Now wait three 
minutes. With a tenth cc of ‘Tran- 
quille’ in you, you could attend 
your own hanging in a calm 
mood.” 

“Thank you. Doctor. Dr. Hed- 
rick, what’s bothering Johann 
now? Your message was not spe- 
cific.” 

Hedrick shook his head. “The 
patient won’t talk to us. Simply 
demands to see you.” 

“Uh ... he has found out? Or, 
rather, if he has, what then?” 

Hedrick turned to his colleague. 
“Dr. Garcia?” 

“You know my opinion. Doc- 
tor. Your patient has recovered, 
is simply weak from being too 
long in bed. There is no longer any 
excuse — any medical excuse — for 
restraints.” 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



“Dr. Rosenthal?” 

The psychiatrist shrugged. “The 
human mind is a weird and won- 
derful thing — and the longer I 
study it the less I’m sure about 
anything concerning it. But I agree 
with Dr. Garcia on one point: You 
can’t keep a patient tied down for- 
ever.” 

Hedrick said, “I’m afraid that’s 
it. Counselor.” 

Salomon sighed. “And I’ve been 
appointed a volunteer.” 

“Any of us will go in with you 
if you wish, sir. But the patient 
flatly refuses to talk to us. We’ll 
be standing by, ready to move fast 
if a crisis develops.” 

“The dummy-switches dodge 
again?” 

“Oh, certainly. And this time 
the nurse has been instructed to 
get out if you tell her to. You, not 
the patient. But don’t worry; I’ll 
be watching and listening by 
closed-circuit video; Dr. Garcia 
and Dr. Rosenthal will watch the 
monitor ‘scopes’.” 

“I’m not worrying, that drug 
must have hit me. Okay, I’ll go in 
— and if I have to ride the tiger. 
I’ll hang onto its ears.” 

J OHANN SMITH said, “Jake! 

Where the hell have you been? 
You’ve come to see me just once 
in the past three weeks. Once! 
Damn you.” 

“I’ve been working. Which is 
more than you can say.” 

“You think so, eh? Physiother- 
apy is damned hard work, harder 
than you ever do, you shyster — 
and I have to go through it seven 
days a week.” 

“My heart bleeds, Johann — 




141 




want a chit to see the Chaplain? I 
was laid up sick for ten days — 
which I’m sure Hedrick told you — 
and I still don’t feel chipper, so 
move over, you lazy bastard, and 
let me stretch out. Damn it, 
Johann, I’m not as young as I 
used to be; I can’t jump through 
hoops every time you snap your 
fingers.” 

“Now, now, Jake, don’t take 
that line with me. I’m sorry you 
were ill. I told ’em to send you 
flowers. Did you get them?” 

“Yes. Thank you.” 

“That’s odd, I didn’t send any. 
Caught you, didn’t I? Jake, I never 
intend to overwork a man — but, 
damn it, when he’s on my payroll 
I expect to hear from him occa- 
sionally. And see him.” 

“I’m not on your payroll.” 

“Huh? What nonsense is this?” 
“When the court appointed me 
your guardian pro tern and con- 
servator, McCampbell awarded 
me a token fee of ten dollars a 
month. That’s all I am allowed to 
accept from you — and I haven’t 
collected it.” 

Johann looked incredulous. 
“Well, we’ll change that in a hur- 
ry! You get word to Judge Mc- 
Campbell that I said — ” 

“Stow it, Johann. It was part of 
the deal to shut up your grand- 
daughters. Now what is eating 
you? Mrs. Branca? You’ve had a 
report each day — negative. I 
fetched a briefcase stuffed with de- 
tailed reports — all negative but 
showing what has been done. Want 
to read ’em? I see you have a read- 
ing machine now.” 

“Read negative reports? Jake, 
don’t be silly. Yes, I’m fretted 

142 



about Eunice — damn it, even if she 
didn’t want to work for me any 
longer, you’d think she would have 
paid me the minimum courtesy of 
a sickroom visit. But that’s not 
what is on my mind — not why I 
sent for you, I mean. Nurse!” 

“Yes, sir?” 

“Switch off the voice monitors, 
then go hide your head in the idiot 
box. Pick any program as long as 
it’s loud; I want privacy.” 

“Yes, sir.” She stood up and 
switched off the dummy switches. 
“Nurse.” 

“Yes, Mr. Salomon?” 

“Ask Dr. Hedrick if we can 
have full privacy. I don’t think Mr. 
Smith is going to swing from the 
chandelier simply because I don’t 
have a nursing degree.” 

“Mr. Salomon, Dr. Hedrick 
says that we are doing so well — ” 
she smiled brightly — “aren’t we, 
Mr. Smith? — that if you wanted 
to talk privately, I could leave. 
Just push this red button when you 
want me.” She smiled again and 
left. 

Johann said, “Well, that’s a sur- 
prise!” 

“Why so? You’re getting well, 
Hedrick says so.” 

“Hmm. I fear the Greeks, even 
bearing gifts. Jake, come close, I 
want to whisper . because I 
wouldn’t put it past ’em to have a 
spare microphone tucked away 
somewhere.” 

“Paranoia, you old fool. Why 
would Hedrick bother to listen to 
our conversation?” 

“‘Young fool,’ please — I’m 
young again. Paranoid, possibly. 
Anyhow I don’t want anybody to 
hear this but you. Because if I’m 

GALAXY 




mistaken, it won’t sound good to 
have this repeated in court in a 
competency hearing. So lean close 
and listen hard. Jake . I'm al- 
most certain this new body of mine 
is femaleV 

Jake Salomon’s ears started to 
buzz and he was glad that Garcia 
had given him that shot. “So? In- 
teresting idea. If true, what are 
you going to do? Take it back to 
the complaint desk and demand 
another one?” 

“Oh, don’t talk like a fool, 
Jake. Whatever body I have now. 
I’m stuck with — and if it’s female, 
well, it’ll seem odd but half the hu- 
man race manages to bear up un- 
der it; I guess I can. But don’t you 
see'! If my notion is correct, that’s 
why they’ve taken such great care 
not to let me see myself. Afraid I 
would jump my cams, no doubt.” 
Johann chuckled. “I’m tougher 
than that. Shucks, they haven’t 
even let you see anything you 
could spot as female — sheet over 
my whole body, not even my arms 
in sight, and enough gear hooked 
to me to clutter up any lines of 
figure. Towel over my scalp — I 
suppose the hair is growing back, 
or such. If I’m horsefaced enough, 
you couldn’t tell my sex just from 
my face. My new face.” 

“Perhaps. It’s an interesting the- 
ory. How did you reach it?” 

“Oh, a number of things. Espe- 
cially the fact that, even though I 
now can use my hands and arms, 
they won’t let me. Except during 
controlled physiotherapy. Can’t 
touch myself, I mean; they strap 
me down again at once, with an 
excuse about ‘spastic muscle ac- 
tion’ and so forth. Which I did 



have at first and don’t have now. 
But never mind. This is the first 
time there hasn’t been a nurse in 
the room. So find out. Lift the 
sheet and look! Tell me, Jake, am 
I male or female! Hurry — she 
might come back.” 

Salomon sat still. “Johann.” 
“What, Jake? Hurry up, man!” 
“You’re female.” 



J OHANN SMITH was silent 
several moments, then said, 
“Well, it’s a relief to be sure. At 
least I’m not crazy. If ‘female’ and 
‘crazy’ aren’t synonyms. Well, 
Jake? How did it happen?” 

“I’ve known it all along, Johann. 
It’s been a strain on me to see you 
and not let on. For you are cor- 
rect; your doctors were afraid that 
you might not take it well. While 
you were still weak.” 

“They don’t know me very well 
— it’s not half the surprise it was 
to me when — at about six, it was — 
I found out that girls really are 
different from boys. Little girl 
down the block, it was. Showed 
me. But how did it happen, Jake? 
It wasn’t what I signed up for.” 
“Oh, but it was.” 

“Eh?” 

“No instruction you gave said 
one word about race or sex. You 
specified ‘healthy,’ and around 
twenty to forty years old, and with 
AB-Negative blood. Nothing else.” 
Johann blinked. “Yes. But it 
never occurred to me that they 
might put me into a woman’s 
body.” 

“Why not? They put women’s 
hearts into male bodies and vice 
versa every day.”

“True. I’m simply saying that 
I never thought about it. But even 
if I had, I don’t think 1 would have 
risked cutting my chances in half 
by making such a restriction. As 
may be, I’ve never been one to cry 
over spilt milk. Well, now that I 
know, there’s no reason to con- 
tinue that silly business about no 
mirrors. Will you step out and tell 
that stubborn doctor that I want to 
see myself at once and no more 
nonsense? If necessary, knock his 
ears in.” 

“I’ll see, Johann.” Salomon 
buzzed for the nurse, then went out. 
He was gone five minutes, returned 
with Drs. Hedrick, Garcia and Ro- 
senthal, and a second nurse, who 
was carrying a large hand mirror. 

Hedrick said, “How do you feel. 
Miss Smith?” 

She smiled wryly. “So it’s ‘Miss’ 
Smith now, is it? Much better, 
thank you; my mind is at ease. 
You could have told me weeks ago; 
I am not as unstable as you think.” 
“That is possible. Miss Smith, 
but I am bound to do what I think 
is best for my patient.” 

“No criticism, none. But now 
that the cat is out of the bag, 
please ask the nurse to show me 
what I look like. I’m curious.” 
“Certainly, Miss Smith.” 

Dr. Garcia waved the nurse at 
the console aside and sat down; 
Hedrick stationed himself on one 
side of the bed, Rosenthal on the 
other. Only then did Hedrick take 
the mirror from the nurse, hold 
it to let his patient see herself in it. 

Johann Smith looked at her new 
face first with intense interest, then 
with unbelief — then her features 
broke in horror. “Oh, my God! 

144 



Dear God, what have they done to 
us? Jake! You knew]” 

The lawyer’s face was working 
in the convulsions of a strong man 
trying not to weep. “Yes, 1 knew, 
Johann. That’s why I couldn’t find 
her for you — because she was 
here along. Right here — and 1 had 
. to talk to her!” He gave up 
and sobbed. 

“Jake, how could you let them 
do it? Eunice, oh Eunice my dar- 
ling, forgive me — I didn’t know]” 
Her sobs echoed his, an octave 
higher. 

Hedrick snapped, “Dr. Garcia!” 
“Started, Doctor!” 

“Dr. Rosenthal, take care of Mr. 
Salomon. Nurse, help him, he’s 
about to fall! Damn it, where’s 
that aspirator?” 

F ive minutes later the room was 
quiet. The patient had been 
forced into sedated sleep. Dr. He- 
drick satisfied himself that Miss 
Smith was safe and turned the bed- 
side watch over to Dr. Garcia. He- 
drick then left the sickroom. 

He found Mr. Salomon stretch- 
ed out on a couch at the remote 
watch station; Dr. Rosenthal was 
seated by the couch, a stethoscope 
around his neck. Hedrick cocked 
an eyebrow at the psychiatrist, who 
mouthed soundlessly, “Okay,” 
then added aloud, “Perhaps you 
will check me.” 

“Very well. Doctor.” Hedrick 
sat down where Rosenthal had 
been, hitched the chair closer, took 
Salomon’s wrist and felt his pulse. 
“How do you feel?” 

“I’m okay,” Salomon said gruf- 
fly. “Sorry I made a fool of my- 
self. How \%sheT' 

I WILLFEAR NO EVIL 




“Sleeping. You were fond of 
her.” 

“We both were fond of her. Doc- 
tor, she was an angel.” 

“Go ahead and cry. Tears are 
lubricant for the soul. Males would 
be better off if they cried as easily 
as women do. Eh, Rosenthal?” 
“Correct, Doctor. Cultures in 
which men cry easily have little 
need of my specialty.” He smiled. 
“Mr. Salomon, you’re in good 
hands so I’ll run along — got to 
shrink a few heads for my col- 
lection. Unless you need me. Doc- 
tor?” 

“Run along. Rosy. You might 
be here in the morning when we 
wake the patient. Say ten o’clock.” 
“Good-bye, Dr. Rosenthal. 
Thank you. Thank you for every- 
thing.” 

“No huhu. Counselor. Don’t 
let that veterinarian sell you any 
flea powder.” He left. 

“Mr. Salomon,” said Hedrick, 
“this big castle is loaded with beds. 
What do you say to sacking out in 
one, then about twenty-one or -two 
o’clock I can give you a pill guar- 
anteed to slug you for eight hours 
of dreamless sleep.” 

“I’m okay, really 1 am.” 

“If you say so. I can’t force 
treatment on you. But as another 
human being who has come to 
know you fairly well — and admire 
you — I must admit that I am 
more worried about you than I am 
about my patient. You referred to 
her as an ‘angel’ — by which you 
meant the donor, not Miss Smith.” 
“Eh? Yes, of course. Eunice 
Branca.” Salomon’s features con- 
torted momentarily. 

“I never knew her and I’ve had 



little experience with angels; doc- 
tors don’t see people at their best. 
But her body would do credit to 
an angel; I have never seen a 
healthier one. Twenty-eight years 
old by the records, physiologically 
perhaps five years younger. She — 
Miss Smith I now mean. Miss 
Johann Smith — can take a severe 
shock and bounce out of it; she 
has that superb young body to sus- 
tain her. But you have had much 
the same shock and — forgive me — 
are no longer young. If you won’t 
sleep here — best — ” 

“I don’t want to sleep here'." 
“Very well. Second best would 
be for you to permit me to check 
your heart and lungs and blood 
pressure. If I don’t like what I find, 
then I want you to rest while I 
send for your physician.” 

“He doesn’t make house calls.” 
Hedrick grunted. “Then he’s not 
a physician; physicians go where 
they are needed. A most unprofes- 
sional remark as we are expected 
to pretend that any M.D. with a li- 
cense is a dedicated saint with the 
wisdom of Jove — even when we 
know he is a bungler whose dedi- 
cation is to the Internal Revenue 
Service. Don’t quote me; they 
might lift my union card. Now 
about that checkup? Do you want 
it?” 

“Uh, yes. Please. And I’ll take 
that pill if you’ll let me take it 
home. Don’t ordinarily use such 
— but tonight is a special case.” 
“Good. If you’ll slip off your 
shirt — ” 

While he worked the physician 
said quietly, “Mr. Salomon, 1 
don’t have Dr. Rosenthal’s train- 
ing. But if it will do you any good 

145 



I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 




to talk, I can listen. This has been 
on your mind, I know. I think 
your worst hurdle is past — letting 
Johann Smith know that he is now 
‘Miss’ Smith, plus the still worse 
shock of seeing him — her — discov- 
er that she now inhabits his former 
secretary’s body. So you are past 
that crisis. If there is more it 
would help to get off your mind, 
feel free to talk. In my profession 
as in yours, such talk is privi- 
leged.” 

“I don’t mind talking about Eu- 
nice. But I don’t know what to 
say.” 

“Well, you might tell me how 
such a lovely girl got killed. Never 
knew the donor’s name until you 
told me. There was a privacy re- 
striction. So we don’t ask — as long 
as the donation is properly certi- 
fied.” 

“Yes, there was such restriction. 
We’ll never know why but I sus- 
pect that the child — woman, I 
mean, and a very competent one 
— but I thought of her as a child, 
being so much older than she was. 
I think Eunice had a romantic no- 
tion that she could give her body 
to her boss if she no longer needed 
it and not let him find out. Ridicu- 
lous, but it fitted her sweet nature. 
I had to tell you, once it looked as 
if old Johann might live through it. 
Because I knew he would blow his 
wig. And he did.” 

“A very good thing you told me. 
Counselor. I think — and Dr. Ros- 
enthal thinks — that we would nev- 
er have pulled this patient through 
if we hadn’t taken extraordinary 
precautions to keep her from 
knowing her sex. In view of the pa- 
tient’s relation to the donor.” 



C LOSE. Close for both of us. 
Doctor, I am not exaggerating 
— if I had been as little as twice 
Eunice’s age — and she not married 
— I would have done my damned- 
est to marry her. And the same, I 
feel certain, goes for old Johann. 
So I knew what a shock it would 
be to him — worse than simply 
learning that she had been killed.” 
“Car accident?” 

“Nothing so innocent. Killed by 
a mugger. Psychopath probably — 
but the point is immaterial as Jo- 
hann’s mobile guards caught him 
almost in the act and killed him. 
That’s how she was saved — her 
body was saved, I mean — because 
they rushed her to a hospital hop- 
ing to save her.” Jake Salomon 
sighed. “It does help to talk.” 
“Good. How did Johann 
Smith’s guards happen to be so 
Johnny-on-the-spot, yet not quite?” 
“Oh. The poor darling tried to 
save ten minutes. She was a blood 
donor — AB-Negative — and — ” 
“O/i! Now I know why ‘Miss’ 
Smith has seemed vaguely famil- 
iar. I saw her once. I’m now cer- 
tain, giving blood to a patient I 
had been called in to support. A 
lovely girl, with a warm disposi- 
tion, friendly, who dressed in, um, 
exotic styles.” 

“Erotic styles you mean, let’s 
not use euphemisms. Yes, Eunice 
did. She knew she was beautiful 
and did not mind sharing her beau- 
ty. Played up to it.” 

“I wish I had known her.” 

“I wish you had. Doctor; your 
life would have been richer there- 
by. If she had a call to give blood, 
Johann’s guards were under orders 
to driver her. Protect her. Pick her

up at her door, escort her to the 
car, deliver her, wait for her. But 
this was an emergency and she 
lives — lived — nineteen levels up in 
one of those beehives in the north 
end. Vehicle lift, sure — but not 
able to lift the sort of armor 
Johann owned. Owns. So the poor 
darling decided to save ten minutes 
and used the passenger elevator 
without waiting for escort. And 
that’s where she was jumped. 
KUled.” 

“A pity. I suppose she didn’t 
know that we can always stretch a 
patient an extra ten minutes if we 
know a donor is on the way.” 
“Maybe she did, maybe she 
didn’t — but it is characteristic of 
Eunice Branca that she tried to 
hurry.” 

“A pity. You can put your shirt 
on. How old did you say you 
were?” 

“I didn’t say. Seventy-two is 
staring me in the face.” 

“I’m amazed. You seem to be 
younger — internally I mean, not 
necessarily your face — ” 

“So I’m ugly. I know it.” 

“I think ‘distinguished’ is the 
accepted term. You seem much 
younger, physiologically. Say 
twenty years.” 

“So I take my hormones.” 

“I’m not sure you need them. 
Go home if you wish. Or stay. If 
you stay. I’d like to put a monitor 
on your heart. Professional inter- 
est.” (And to make damn sure you 
don’t conk out, old fellow — some- 
times a heart stops for no good 
reason after a shock such as you 
have had.) 

“Uh ... I am tired. Could I 
skip dinner and go straight to bed? 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



With maybe a twelve-hour dose in- 
stead of eight?” 

“No trouble.” 

Soon Jake Salomon was in bed 
and asleep. Hedrick ate, looked in 
on his patient, left orders with the 
night watch to call him if the dis- 
plays exceeded certain tolerances, 
went to bed and to sleep; he never 
needed the drugs he prescribed. 

Despite sedation, Johann 
Smith’s dreams were troubled. 
Once the old man in the borrowed 
skull muttered, “Eunice?” (I’m 
here. Boss. Go back to sleep.) “All 
right, my dear. Just wanted to 
know where you’d gone.” (Quit 
fretting. Boss. I’m here.) Johann 
smiled in his sleep and then slept 
quietly, no more bad dreams. 

T he morning nurse bustled in 
with a tray. “Good morning. 
Miss Smith! How are we today?” 

“1 don’t know how you are, but 
I’m hungry.” 

“Good! Hot oatmeal this morn- 
ing, dear, and orange juice and a 
boiled egg — and we’ll soak a little 
toast in egg so that it will go down 
easily. I’m going to tilt the bed up 
a touch.” 

“Mrs. Sloan — ” 

“Yes? Let me tuck the napkin 
under your chin.” 

“Stop that, or I’ll tell you where 
to tuck it! Uncover me and un- 
strap me; I’m going to feed my- 
self.” (Boss, don’t be rude to her. 
She’s trying to help you.) (Eunice?) 
(Of course, dear — didn’t I promise 
I wouldn’t leave you again?) 
(But — ) (Shush, she’s talking.) 

“Now, Miss Smith, you know I 
can’t do that. Please, dear. Doesn’t 
this smell good?” 



147 




“Uh ... I suppose you can’t 
unstrap me without Dr. Hedrick’s 
permission. I’m sorry I snapped at 
you.” (That’s better. Boss!) “But 
don’t try to feed me, please don’t. 
Instead please find Dr. Hedrick 
and tell him I’m being difficult 
,again. You might also tell him 
that, if he doesn’t want to go along 
with my unreasonable demands, he 
had better try to reach Mr. Salo- 
mon. Because if anyone tries to 
put food in my mouth while my 
hands are strapped. I’ll do my best 
to spit it on the ceiling.” (Is that 
better, Eunice?) (Some, Boss. Say 
ten percent.) (Uh, darn, I don’t 
have any practice in being a lady.) 
(I’ll teach you. Boss.) (Eunice, are 
you really there, dear? Or have I 
come unstuck just as they thought 
I would?) (Discuss it later. Boss 
dear — you’re going to have to face' 
the doctor right away . and don't 
mention me ... or you know 
what’ll happen. They’ll never un- 
strap our wrists. You know that, 
don’t you.) (Of course I do! Think 
I’m crazy?) (Irrelevant and imma- 
terial as Jake would say. The ppint 
is never to let Dr. Hedrick — or 
anybody — guess that I’m here . 
or they’ll be certain you’re crazy. 
Now I’m going to shut up.) (Don’t 
go ’way!) (Boss, I’ll never go away; 
I’ll just keep quiet. You and I had 
better talk mostly when others 
aren’t around. Unless I see you 
about to make a mistake.) (Going 
to nag me, huh?) Johann heard her 
merry giggle. (Haven’t I always. 
Boss? Watch it; here come the 
cops.) 

Dr. Hedrick came in, followed 
by Dr. Garcia. “Good morning. 
Miss Smith.” 

148 



“Good morning, gentlemen.” 
The patient nodded at them. 

“Nurse says that you would like 
to try feeding yourself.” 

“That’s true but that’s not all of 
it. I want these straps and clamps 
removed, all of them.” 

“Letting you feed yourself is no 
problem. It’s a good idea, good 
practice. As for the rest — That 
calls for thought.” 

“Doctor, the masquerade is 
over. If you can’t see your way 
clear to removing all restraints 
from my body, then forget about 
breakfast; I won’t starve. Get my 
lawyer instead.” 

“As it happens, Mr. Salomon is 
in the house — ” 

“Then get him!” 

“Just a moment, please.” Dr. 
Hedrick glanced at Dr. Garcia, 
who had seated himself at the con- 
sole; Dr. Garcia nodded. “Miss 
Smith, would you agree to a rea- 
sonable compromise? Or at least 
listen?” 

“I’ll listen. But — ” (Shut up. 
Boss!) “I’ll listen. Doctor.” 

“Mr. Salomon is, as you know, 
an elderly man, and he had a try- 
ing day yesterday. I persuaded him 
to stay overnight, and rest. I’m told 
that he is just getting up; he has 
not had breakfast. I have and so 
has Dr. Garcia — but so long ago 
that we could use a bit of brunch. 
Now I can unstrap your arms, let 
you feed yourself — but unstrapping 
your pelvis . well, as you must 
have guessed, there is some odd 
plumbing down there, and other 
things. Takes time to unhitch ev- 
erything. 

“So here is my thought. You 
can invite Mr. Salomon to join 

GALAXY 




you for breakfast . and you 
could invite us, too, for that bit of 
brunch — and we four can talk over 
what needs to be done next. I shall 
follow the wishes of your guar — 
your lawyer. Or let him select an- 
other physician and withdraw, if I 
find that I must.” 

“My guardian,” Johann said 
quietly. “We’ll do whatever my 
guardian requires. But I hope he 
does not decide to replace you. Dr. 
Hedrick. I have been a difficult pa- 
tient and I’m sorry. I know what a 
miraculous job you have done on 
me . and I am grateful.” 

“Thank you. Miss Smith.” 

“I would be delighted to have 
you three gentlemen join me for 
brunch ... if you will be so kind 
as to unstrap my arms.” 

(Boss!) (What’s biting you, little 
one? I thought I was being a per- 
fect lady?) (You are — but don’t 
you dare let gentlemen in here to 
eat with us until we’re made pretty! 
Not a speck of makeup, and our 
hair must be a mess. Horrid!) (But 
look, dear, it’s just Jake and our 
doctors.) (It’s the principle of the 
thing. I know more about being a 
girl than you do — well, don’t I? 
When did I ever come to work with 
my face stark naked and my hair 
in rats? Why, I often got up much 
earlier than I had to, just to make 
sure that I was as pretty as pos- 
sible, just for you. Didn’t 1? Did I 
not?) 

PAIN, Miss Smith?” 

“Eh? I mean, ‘Oh?’ Sorry, 
Doctor, just thinking. If I am to 
have gentlemen guests for break- 
fast, shouldn’t 1 start practicing 
how to be a lady? It’s new to me, 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



you know. Do I have any makeup 
on?” 

Hedrick looked startled. “Do 
you mean lipstick?” 

“Whatever it is that ladies put 
on their faces; I’m sure it’s always 
more than lipstick. And my hair 
should be brushed. Or do I have 
hair?” 

“Why, certainly you have. Still 
short but a fine, healthy growth.” 
“That’s a relief. I thought possi- 
bly 1 had a plastic skull and would 
have to wear wigs.” 

“There was some prosthetic res- 
toration. But Dr. Boyle managed 
to save the scalp and you’ll never 
notice the prosthesis.” Hedrick 
smiled briefly. “Tougher than na- 
tural bone. 'With good blood sup- 
ply to your scalp and normal hair 
— just hasn’t grown out very far.” 
“I’m relieved. Dandruff?” 
“Haven’t noticed any.” 

“We won’t worry about it this 
morning. Doctor, I’d like to be 
made up to look like a lady ready 
to receive guests. If you’ll have 
one of the servants take in a cup 
of coffee and some orange juice to 
Mr. Salomon along with our invi- 
tation to breakfast. I’m sure he 
won’t mind waiting.” (How’m I 
doing, Eunice?) (Fine, old dear!) 

Dr. Hedrick looked puzzled. 
“Miss Smith, when I set up a sup- 
port team, I try to anticipate every 
possible emergency, supplies, 
drugs, and so forth. This is the 
first time I’ve been asked to pro- 
duce lipstick. And cosmetics.” 

“Oh. But you’re not being asked 
to. Doctor. The ladies’ powder 
room on the first floor is stocked 
with all shades of lipstick and 
many cosmetics. Should be. Was. 

149 




Should still be, or someone will 
hear about it. And one of the 
nurses can help me. That pretty 
redhead — Minnie? Ginny? Miss 
Gersten, I mean. She must know 
quite a lot abput cosmetics.” (She 
does — that red hair came out of a 
bottle, Boss.) (Meeow! Shut up, 
pussy cat.) (Wasn’t being catty. 
Boss. She does well, in spite of 
those godawful uniforms.) 

“Winifred Gersten,” said Dr. 
Garcia. “Nurse, find Winnie. And 
take that tray out; it’s cold.” 

Forty minutes later Miss Johann 
Smith was ready to receive. Her 
hair was fluffed, her face had been 
made up with restrained boldness 
by the red-haired nurse, and the re- 
sult as shown in a mirror had been 
approved by the second voice in- 
side Smith — grudgingly, it seemed 
to Johann — (I can do better. It’ll 
do for now). 

The bed had been contoured to 
let her sit up and from somewhere 
a smart bed jacket had been pro- 
duced, one that matched her eyes. 
Best of all, her hands and arms 
were free. 

Johann found that her hands 
were trembling. She attributed it 
to excitement and decided that, if 
she had trouble controlling a fork, 
she would stick to things that 
would not slop on her Jacket — be- 
sides, she was not hungry now. Too 
excited. 

(Steady down. Boss, darling. 
Leave the eating to me.) 

(But-) 

(No ‘buts.’ I’ve been feeding that 
face for years. The body remem- 
bers, Boss. You talk to the gentle- 
men; I’ll handle the calories. Now 
let’s shut up; they’re arriving.) 

150 



“May we come in?” 

“Do, gentlemen, please. Good 
morning, Jake. 1 hope you had a 
good night’s rest.” (Put out your 
hand to him. Boss.) 

“Slept like a child.” 

“Good. So did I.” Johann ex- 
tended her left arm and hand, that 
being the side the lawyer was on. 
“Look, Jake! Hands!” 

Salomon took her hand, bowed 
over it — hesitated and then touched 
it to his lips. Johann was so 
amazed that the hand was almost 
snatched back. (Good God! What 
does Jake think I am? A pansy?) 
(He thinks you’re a beautiful girl. 
You are. I should know. Look, 
Boss, we must talk about Jake — 
later. Say hello to your shrink.) 

D r. ROSENTHAL was saying, 
“I’m a party-crasher. May I 
come in. Miss Smith?” 

“You’re most welcome. Some- 
one is going to have to assure these 
other gentlemen that I don’t have 
termites in the attic; I’m depend- 
ing on you. Doctor.” 

The psychiatrist smiled down at 
her. “That is an appeal hard to re- 
sist. I must say your improvement 
since yesterday is astounding. 
You’re looking lovely — Miss 
Smith.” 

Johann smiled and gave him her 
hand. Dr. Rosenthal bowed over it 
and kissed it — not a quick and 
frightened peck such as Salomon 
had given it, but a kiss that was 
soft and warm and unhurriedly 
sensuous. Johann felt a tingle run 
up her arm. (Hey, what is this?) 
(Stay off his couch. Boss. He’s a 
wolf — I can tell.) 

When he straightened up he held 

GALAXY 




her hand a moment longer than 
necessary, smiled at her again, then 
moved away. Johann thought of 
asking him if that was his standard 
way of treating patients, decided 
not to — but felt slightly annoyed 
that the other two doctors had not 
offered the same homage. Yonny 
Schmidt had been born at a time 
and place where hand-kissing was 
unheard of; Johann Smith had nev- 
er taken it up; Miss Johann Smith 
was discovering that the silly cus- 
tom was habit-forming. She felt 
flustered. 

She was saved by another voice 
from the door, that of her butler. 
“May we serve now. Miss Smith?” 

“Cunningham! It’s good to see 
you. Yes, you may serve.” Johann 
wondered who had given instruc- 
tions to make the meal formal? 

The butler stared over her head 
and said tonelessly, “Thank you. 
Miss.” Johann was startled. The 
butler, like all the male household 
staff (and some of the females), 
was sudden death armed or un- 
armed; his manner alone could in- 
timidate news snoops. (The poor 
man is scared!) (Of course. So 
calm him down. Boss.) 

“But first come here, Cunning- 
ham.” 

“Yes, Miss.” Her household 
chief walked carefully toward her, 
stopped a very respectful distance 
away. 

“Oh, do come closer. Look at 
me. Right at me, don’t turn your 
eyes away. Cunningham, the way 
I look is a shock to you. Isn’t it?” 

Cunningham swallowed without 
speaking; his Adam’s apple 
bobbed. 

“Oh, come now,” Johann said 
I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



firmly. “Of course it is. But if it 
upsets you, think what a shock it 
is to me. Until yesterday I didn’t 
even know that I had been turned 
into a woman. I’ll have to get used 
to it and so will you. Just remem- 
ber this: Underneath I am the same 
cantankerous, unreasonable, un- 
appreciative old scoundrel who 
hired you as a guard-footman nine- 
teen years ago. I’ll go on expecting 
perfect service, notice it as little, 
and remember to say ‘thank you’ 
as seldom. Do we understand each 
other?” 

The butler barely smiled. “Yes, 
sir — I mean ‘Yes, Miss.’ ” 

“You meant ‘Yes, sir’ but 
you’re going to have to learn to 
call me ‘Yes, Miss’ and I’m going 
to have to learn to expect it. We 
old dogs must learn new tricks. 
How’s your wife’s lumbago?” 

“Some better, she says. Thank 
you. Miss.” 

“Good. Tell Mary I asked. You 
may serve.” 

The brunch was almost merry. 
Johann tasted the wine when Cun- 
ningham offered a sample, ap- 
proved it but declined a glass her- 
self. She barely touched it to her 
tongue but the flavor spread like 
strong brandy and she had been 
startled almost into choking by the 
vibrant wonder of its bouquet. Yet 
the bottle she recognized as that of 
an adequate but not spectacular 
Chablis. She played safe with 
orange juice. 

Table talk was lively and di- 
rected mostly at the hostess with 
no reference to her status as a pa- 
tient. The men seemed to vie for 
her attention — and Johann found 
that she enjoyed it. She laughed 

151 




frequently, answered their sallies 
and felt witty herself. 

But she could see that Jake was 
not eating much and looked at her 
all the time except when she looked 
back ... at which his gaze wavered 
and shifted. Poor Jake. (Eunice, 
what are we going to do about 
Jake?) (Later, Boss— one thing at 
a time.) 

She was startled again when 
Cunningham came to remove her 
plate from her lap table — startled 
to see that scrambled eggs and two 
rolls had disappeared as well as 
orange juice, half a glass of milk 
and one of three link sausages. 
“Coffee, Miss?” 

“1 don’t know. Dr. Hedrick, am 
I allowed coffee?” 

“Miss Smith, now that you can 
eat sitting up, there is no reason 
why you should not eat or drink 
anything you want.” 

“Then I’ll celebrate. The first 
coffee I’ve been permitted in ten 
years — Demi-tasse for me, Cun- 
ningham, but man-size cups for the 
gentlemen. And Cunningham? Is 
there any Mumm ’97 on ice?” 
“Certainly, Miss.” 

“Serve it.” She raised her voice 
a little. “Any sissies who won’t 
drink champagne this early in the 
day may sneak out quietly.” 

No one left. When glasses were 
filled and bubbles were chasing up 
their stems. Dr. Hedrick stood up. 
“Gentlemen, a toast — ” He waited 
until they were standing. Johann 
raised her glass with them. 

But did not drink: the toast was 
“To our lovely and gracious host- 
ess — long may she live!” 

“Amen!” 

“Cheers!” 

152 



And the tinkle of breaking glass. 
Johann felt tears, ignored them. 
“Thank you, gentlemen. Cunning- 
ham, fresh glasses.” 

When they were filled she said, 
“Gentlemen, I ask for another 
standing toast — ” she waited, then 
went on — “this should be to Dr. 
Boyle . and to you, Jake, old 
friend, without whose loyal help I 
would not be here . and certain- 
ly to you. Dr. Hedrick, and to all 
the doctors who have helped you 
and helped Dr. Boyle . and to 
all the patient nurses I have 
snapped at. But those can wait. I 
ask you to drink — ” her tears were 
falling and her voice was almost a 
whisper — “to the memory of the 
sweetest, loveliest and most gallant 
girl 1 have ever known . Eunice 
Branca.” 

T he toast was drunk in silence. 

Then Jake Salomon slowly 
crumpled into his chair and cov- 
ered his face with his hands. 

Dr. Hedrick jumped to help him. 
Dr. Garcia was quick on the other 
side. Johann stared in helpless dis- 
tress. (Oh, I should have known 
better! But I meant it, darling, I 
meant every word.) (I know you 
did. Boss, and I appreciate it. But 
it’s all right. Jake has got to admit 
that I’m dead. And so do you.) 
(Are you dead, Eunice? Are you?) 
(Don’t worry over a word. Boss. 
I’m here and I won’t leave you, 
ever. I promised you. Have you 
ever known me to break my word?) 
(No, never.) (So believe me this 
time. But we’ve got to take care of 
Jake.) (How, dearest girl?) (When 
the time comes, you’ll know. Talk 
later, when we’re alone.) 

GALAXY 




Dr. Rosenthal was leaning over 
her. “Are you all right, my dear?” 
“I’m okay — ^just terribly sorry 
about Mr. Salomon. Is he all 
right?” 

“He will be, shortly. Miss 
Smith, don’t worry about Mr. Sa- 
lomon. Yes, you brought on an- 
other catharsis — which he needed, 
or he would not have had it. As for 
his physical well-being, he’s in Dr. 
Hedrick’s hands . and Curt Hed- 
rick hasn’t lost a patient he reached 
in time since he started practicing 
his specialty. Your house is loaded 
with everything Dr. Hedrick could 
possibly need . and Mr. Salo- 
mon isn’t even ill. He simply needs 
to lie down, plus a happy drug.” 

Dr. Rosenthal sat with her while 
the room was cleared of dishes, 
brunch table, dining chairs, etc. Dr. 
Hedrick returned with Dr. Garcia. 
Johann again asked, “How is he?” 
“Half asleep. Slightly ashamed 
of being a ‘spectacle’ and a ‘nui- 
sance’ — his terms. But only slight- 
ly as what I gave him doesn’t per- 
mit such self-hate very long. How 
are yoM?” 

“She’s ready to go six rounds,’ 
Rosenthal assured him. 

“So the ’scopes say. We might 
as well get on with our conference. 
Miss Smith. I discussed all that I 
am going to say with Mr. Salomon 
while you were getting pretty be- 
fore brunch, and he approves. I am 
withdrawing from your case.” 

“Oh, Dr. Hedrick! No!" 

“Yes. Dear lady, ain’t nobody 
going away mad. This means that 
you are well. Well. Oh, still weak, 
still in need of care. But I’m not 
deserting you. I’m turning you 
over to Dr. Garcia.” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



She looked at Dr. Garcia, who 
nodded. “Nothing to worry about. 
Miss Smith.” 

“But — Doctor Hedrick, you will 
come back and see me? Won’t 
you?” 

“Delighted to. But not very 
soon. I’m afraid. You see — well, 
there is an interesting transplant 
case which has been hanging fire. A 
radical one, the heart and both 
lungs. Now they are ready to start 
surgery. I received a call before 
you were awake, asking if I would 
be available. I said that I would 
have to call back — and after I saw 
you I did call and said that ! could 
do it. After consulting Dr. Garcia, 
of course, and notifying Mr. Salo- 
mon.” He smiled quickly. “So, if 
you will excuse me. I’ll leave.” 

Johann sighed and reached out 
her hand. “Since you must.” 

Hedrick took her hand, bent 
over it; Dr. Rosenthal said lazily, 
“Aren’t you going to scrub first. 
Doctor?” 

Hedrick said, “You go to hell, 
Rosy!” and kissed her hand. 

I T SEEMED to Johann that Dr. 

Hedrick stretched it at least twice 
as long as Dr. Rosenthal’s earlier 
effort. She felt goose pimples on 
her arm and a most curious feeling 
at her middle — yes, she decided, if 
one had to be a woman, this was a 
custom to be encouraged. 

(Going to lay him. Boss?) (Eu- 
nice!) (Oh, piffle. Boss. We’re Si- 
amese twins now and should be 
honest with each other. You 
wanted to lay me for years. But 
couldn’t. You knew you wanted to, 

I knew it too; we just never talked 
about it. Now you still can’t. But 

153 




you can lay him if you want to . 
and it’s the best way to say ‘Thank 
you.’ But watch it, dearie. Do it 
here, not where you might get 
caught. He has a jealous wife; he 
has all the signs.) (Eunice, I’m not 
going to discuss such a ridiculous 
idea! I’m surprised at you. You, a 
nice girl — and married yourself.) 
(Wups, dearie! I’m not married. 
‘Until death do us part’ is the limit 
. .and I’m a ghost. ’Minds me, 
though — my husband — erase and 
correct; my widower, Joe Branca. 
Got to talk about him, too. Doc’s 
turning to go. So wet your lips and 
smile, if you have it even faintly on 
your mind. And you have.) 

Miss Smith wet her lips and 
smiled. “Adios, Doctor, not good- 
bye. Hurry back. When you can.” 
(You’re learning, dearie, you’re 
learning.) 

Dr. Garcia said, ‘‘Miss 
Smith—” 

“Oh. Yes, Doctor?” 

“If you’re ready. I’ll get nurses 
in and we’ll unharness you and sev- 
eral other things. You can have a 
general anesthetic if you wish. I 
suggest locals, with a chin screen 
to keep you from seeing how I’m 
bungling it. With something you 
want to read projected, and some 
music.” 

“Music would be nice. But I 
won’t read. I’m too interested. Lo- 
cals, then. Or nothing, pain doesn’t 
upset me.” 

“But it upsets me, so we’ll use 
local anesthesia.” 

For an hour and more she lis- 
tened to a tape of evergreens, from 
classic rock she had never grown 
used to clear back to folk music 
popular before Johann Schmidt 

154 



was born. Mostly she enjoyed lazi- 
ly the sensuous pleasure of feeling 
her body being touched and hand- 
led and manipulated. Not only was 
it wonderful to have a body after 
days of complete paralysis from 
the neck down (plus fear of being 
forever a basket case, a fear Jo- 
hann had never fully admitted) but 
also, most important, this body felt 
everything so sensitively — ^just to 
be touched was pleasure. 

Not much like that old wreck 
you discarded! For the past ten, 
fifteen years that body’s sole vir- 
tue had been that it still ran. It re- 
minded her of a fifth-hand Model- 
T Ford that he and four other 
young cake-eaters had bought for 
seventy dollars in Baltimore and 
had driven half across the conti- 
nent — no lights, no brakes (the re- 
verse had to serve), no driving li- 
censes (unheard of), no instru- 
ments, no nothing. But the tough 
and ugly little touring car had 
chugged along on three cylinders 
(not always the same three) at a 
(estimated) top speed of twenty- 
five miles an hour. They had 
stopped now and then to throw 
water on the spokes to keep them 
from falling out. 

Somewhere on a dirt road in 
Missouri it had coughed and quit, 
and smell had traced the trouble to 
the wiring. Yonny had fixed it — 
wrapped the burned insulation with 
toilet paper, tied it with string . 
cranked the heap and it had started 
at once and chugged along as be- 
fore. 

She wondered where that sturdy 
old junkpile had wound up? And 
what had become of her male 
body? Johann’s will had left it to a 

GALAXY 




medical school — but since Johann 
hadn’t died, quite, that will did not 
control. Had they pickled it? Or 
swept it out with the trash? Must 
ask. 

S EVERAL times she felt pulling 
sensations that should have hurt 
but did not and once a sharp pain 
which she ignored. There were 
odors, sour-sweet and nauseating; 
she thought of suggesting that the 
air system be turned up, then de- 
cided to mind her own business. 
Presently the odors were gone and 
she became aware that she was be- 
ing given a bed bath, then sheets 
and pad were being changed. 

The chin screen was removed; 
the top part of the fresh bottom 
sheet was whisked into place by 
two nurses while a third lifted Miss 
Smith’s shoulders. Two nurses left 
the room, carrying a hamper be- 
tween them. “There,” said Dr. 
Garcia. “That wasn’t so bad, was 
it?” 

“Not at all. I feel grand.” She 
wiggled her toes, opened and closed 
her thighs. “Grand! Now Tm me 
all over — free! Doctor? Since I’m 
no longer wired for sight and 
sound, not to mention plumbing, 
do we need this fancy hospital bed? 
I would stop feeling like an invalid 
sooner if I had my own bed.” 
“Mmm . must you rush it? 
This bed is the right height for 
nurses to work on you — back rubs 
and such — and it has side rails 
which can be raised when you 
sleep. Miss Smith, every nurse’s 
nightmare is the thought of a pa- 
tient falling out of bed.” 

“Well! 'What do you think I am? 
A baby?” 

I WILL FEAR NO EVIL 



“Yes, Miss, that’s what I think 
you are. A baby getting acquainted 
with its body. Babies can fall. But 
1 don’t intend to let you fall. Ei- 
ther out of bed, or in learning to 
walk. Or in taking a tub bath, 
which you will be demanding al- 
most at once.” 

(Play it cool. Boss!) “Doctor, I 
will follow your orders. But my 
own bed has its points. It will con- 
tour, just touch a button. And it 
has hydraulic lift. Raises as high as 
this one or higher — but will also 
lower till it’s hardly more than a 
mattress on the floor, ten inches 
high. Will this one do that?” 

“Mmm, no.” 

“I did fall out of bed, ten years 
back. It shook me up so, that I 
ordered this special bed. Back when 
I was still walking I used to raise 
it to the easiest height — about at 
my hips — to get into it. Then low- 
er it all the way down to sleep.” 

“Mmm . maybe we can make 
a deal. Will you promise me al- 
ways to lower the bed once you get 
into it? Even if you don’t intend to 
sleep.” 

She smiled. “Signed and wit- 
nessed and with posted perfor- 
mance bond.” 

“I don’t think we need to go that 
far. Miss Smith, we no longer need 
to monitor you the forty-’leven 
ways we’ve been doing. But I want 
a continuous check on heart action 
and respiration until you are living 
a normal life. That’s the main rea- 
son I need this life-support bed. 
But if you will let me fasten to 
your skin, anywhere on your ribs, 
a little pickup-transmitter weighing 
a half-ounce and no bigger than an 
alloy dollar, we won’t need this 

155 




fancy bed. It’s comfortable, you’ll 
forget it’s on you. You can bathe 
with it in place — waterproof and 
sticks like a poor relation.” 

She smiled. “Start sticking!” 
“I’ll fetch it. And have the 
nurses swap beds.” 

“Oh, the nurses can’t move my 
bed. It takes big huskies and a 
power dolly. Tell Cunningham. 
But no rush. Speaking of nurses — 
Winnie, don’t you need to wash 
. your hands or something? I want 
to talk to my doctor.” 

The redhead smiled at her. 
“Dear, I’ve heard everything. 
Don’t mind me.” 

“Look, Winnie, you did a lovely 
job on my face when I did not 
know how. But that’s the point, 
dear. Outside I’m a woman. But 
up here back of my eyes is still a 
crabby old man who is far too shy 
— chicken, I mean — too chicken to 
discuss intimate matters with a 
pretty girl present. And I must." 

“Miss Gersten, go to the watch 
station and take a break. I’ll call 
you.” 

“Yes, Doctor.” 

Once she was gone Johann said, 
“You’re durn sure all the mikes 
are dead?” 

“We’re private. Miss Smith.” 
“Call me ‘Johann,’ Doc; this 
has got to be man-to-man — and 
embarrasses me even discussing it 
with a man. All right, first ques- 
tion; Did I come sick — menstru- 
ate — in the last few days?” 

Garcia looked surprised. “You 
twigged? Yes, you are just over 
your period; we removed a tamp- 
on while we were working on you 
and it was not necessary to replace 
it. But where did I miss? I thought 

156 



1 had anticipated it and had bolshoi 
painkiller in you in tinle. You felt 
cramps?” 

“Not a twinge. But things didn’t 
feel right . and that’s when I 
started getting suspicious about 
my sex.” She looked thoughtful. 
“Perhaps it was the tampons — I 
felt something odd down there — 
and now the feeling is no longer 
there.” 

“Might have been that. I would 
have used napkin pads, usual hos- 
pital practice. But there were just 
too many bells and whistles — 
plumbing I mean — in the way. I 
didn’t think you would notice a 
tampon placed while you were se- 
dated. Contrary to popular belief 
there is almost no sensation inside 
a vagina.” 

“So? There damn well is in 
mine! I just didn’t know what the 
sensation was.” 

“Well, the matter has never 
come up before; your case is 
unique. Was that all that was 
troubling you. Miss — sorry! Jo- 
hann.” 

“No. This new body of mine — 
Has it had a whatchamacallit, a fe- 
male examination?” 

“Oh, certainly. Dr. Kystra, best 
G-Y-N man in town. Done while 
you were paralyzed, checked again 
after your spinal cord fused but 
done while you were in deep seda- 
tion. All okay.” 

“I want a full report. Damn it. 
Doc, I’m in charge of this body 
now . and I know as little about 
how to be female as my Gross- 
mutter knew about aircraft. Noth- 
ing, that is.” 

“I can get the report out of file 
if you want it — ” 



GALAXY 




“Ido!” 

“ — but I can tell it in terms you 
are more likely to understand. 
Shall I?” 

“Go ahead.” 

“VOU have a normal female 
I body, physiological age circa 
twenty-five — calendar age some- 
what older, I understand. Breasts 
normal virginal — which doesn’t 
mean your body is virgo intacta; 
it isn’t. Just means you haven’t 
suckled a child. No trace of ab- 
dominal surgery, from which I 
conclude that your appendix is in 
place and your tubes are intact — ” 
“Meaning I could get pregnant.” 
“ — the latter opinion having 
been confirmed by insufflation 
while you were paralyzed. You 
not only could get pregnant; you 
will. Unless you live an absolutely 
chaste life — and even if you plan 
to, I would still recommend pre- 
cautionary contraception — say 
six-month implants in one buttock. 
The best-laid plans of mice and 
men, you know. And women. Es- 
pecially women. Since you are Rh- 
negative about six-sevenths of the 
male population could give you a 
damaged or stillborn child. We 
can prevent that if we know it in 
time, but an unexpected pregnancy 
can turn out tragically. So don’t 
let it be unexpected. Plan it. In the 
meantime use contraception.” 
“Doc, what makes you so damn 
sure I’ll get pregnant? Even if I get 
married — which I do not plan on 
— hell. I’ve had only hours to get 
used to the notion of being female; 
I certainly haven’t had time to con- 
sider being actively female. But 
even so, as the old gal said, 

I WILLFEARNOEVIL 



‘Shucks, honey, hundred and hun- 
dreds of times ain’t nothing happen 
a-tall.’ ” 

“If you adjust normally to being 
a young female, you will be active 
about it, that’s why. Or you will 
eventually wind up on Dr. Rosen- 
thal’s confession couch or some 
emotional equivalent, such as Join- 
ing a nunnery. Johann, your new 
body has a normal female hormon- 
al balance; you had better plan ac- 
cordingly. Even getting your tubes 
cut is no answer; you might come 
down with the emotional never-get- 
overs through regretting it. As for 
what the old gal said, it doesn’t 
apply. Because of that child’you’ve 
already had.” 

“What?'' (Boss, why didn’t you 
mind your own business? I could 
have told you all of this you need 
to know.) (Shut up, Eunice.) 

Garcia looked surprised. “You 
didn’t know? I had assumed that, 
since this body was that of your 
secretary, you knew that she had 
had a child. Or children.” 

“Not only didn’t know it, I don’t 
believe it.” Surely the security in- 
vestigation would have turned up 
such an obvious fact . and God 
knows Eunice had never been out 
of his sight since then long enough 
to bear a child. 

“I’m afraid you will have to be- 
lieve it, uh, Johann. Striations 
called stretch marks on belly and 
buttocks — hardly noticeable unless 
your skin is tanned and then easily 
concealed by cosmetics. But pres- 
ent. Not definitive, as a woman, 
or even a male, can get stretch 
marks from obesity. But charac- 
teristic. But the thing that nails it 
down is that the cervix of a virgin 

157 




womb does not look like that of a 
woman who has borne a child. The 
difference is so marked that a lay- 
man can spot it. I have seen yours. 
Q.E.D. Could be photographed if 
you doubt me.” 

(Drop it, Boss!) 

“Oh, I believe you, now that 
you’ve explained it.” 

“A comparison photo might be 
a good idea. Make you more care- 
ful. I was not implying any criti- 
cism of Mrs. Branca; I was simply 
warning you that the baby-baking 
apparatus you inherited from her 
is in prime shape and ready to be 
triggered each lunar month. Say 
about ten days from now.” 

“I’ll be careful.” 

“Want a lecture on contracep- 
tion?” 

“No.” Johann smiled wryly. 
“Apparently I have at least a week 
before I need a chastity girdle.” 
“Approximately, by statistics. 



But, uh, Johann. No, Miss Smith 
— do you know the technical term 
we physicians use to describe girls 
who depend on rhythm?” 

“No. What?” 

“We call them ‘mothers.’ ” 

“Oh, Ohr 

“So don’t wait too long. Next 
question?” 

“Uh ... no more today. Doc- 
tor; I need to digest what you’ve 
told me. Thank you.” 

“Not at all. Miss Smith. Shall I 
have them switch beds now?” 

“I’ll send for Cunningham later; 
I’d like to rest. Doctor? Could 
you stick that dingus on my ribs? 
Then have the nurses stay out a 
couple of hours?” 

“Certainly. If you’ll let me raise 
the safety rails, as this bed is not 
only ten inches from the floor.” 
“Oh, of course.”

any subject he writes about both understandable 
and entertaining. Reviewers customarily greet 
Asimov publications with such adjectives as 
“brilliant,” “engrossing,” “powerful,” and “spark- 
ling.” Opus 100 is no exception.
