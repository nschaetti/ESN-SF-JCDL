An informal history of 
liquid rocket propellants 




JOHN D. CLARK 

Foreword by Isaac Asimov 

"Read this book . you'll 
get a glimpse of the heroic 
excitement that seemed to 
make it reasonable to 
cuddle with death every 
waking moment — to say 
nothing of learning a heck 
of a lot about the way in 
which the business of sci- 
ence is really conducted.” 
—Isaac Asimov 

Ignition! takes you inside 
the world of scientific 
research — a dangerous, 
exciting, sometimes very 





funny place indeed. John D. 
Clark, in charge of liquid 
propellant development at 
the Picatinny Arsenal for 
some 20 years, gives a first 
hand account of the dedi- 
cated men who survived 
explosions, smelly test 
tubes and one or two wars 
in order to put men on 
the moon. 

"The only clear story of one 
of the high moments of 
scientific research ... as 
good a job of reporting on a 
difficult field as I can re- 
member and far funnier at 
times than most.’'— Lester 
del Rey $10.00

A MESSAGE FROM 
THE PUBLISHER 




ARNOLD E. ABRAMSON 



The United States Postal Service, 
now a semi-independent govern- 
mental corporation, recently in- 
creased postage rates by 1 .4 billion 
dollars. 

And that's just the beginning. In 
its new budget, the Postal Service 
is asking for an additional 414 
million dollars ! 

Included is an increase in maga- 
zine and newspaper rates of 142% 
over the next five years — starting 
with a 30% increase this year. And 
with no reasonable prospect of any 
improvement in service to you. 

Despite the President's efforts to 
curb inflation by means of his 5.5% 
price and wage stabilization program, 
the Postal Service pursues this 
irresponsible plan for enormous 
rate increases — both immediate and 



future. Where is the logic in achieving 
success on some fronts while per- 
mitting the Postal Service to touch 
off roaring inflation in its own area? 

The contemplated postal increases, 
of course, would start an inevitable 
inflationary chain-reaction. Unable 
to absorb the higher costs, publishers 
would be obliged to pass on a portion 
of them to the public — and to ad- 
vertisers who in turn would have to 
pass on the increases to consumers 
of their goods. Directly or indirectly, 
it will be you who pays! 

So we earnestly appeal to the 
President, to Congress and to you. 
the readers of Worlds of IF, to hold 
the line on postal-rate increases for 
at least three compelling reasons: 

1. To deter the general inflation 
threatening all of us — man. woman 
and child. 

2. To protect yourself, specifically, 
from inflationary pressures on ad- 
vertised products that you buy. 

3. To keep costs at a level per- 
mitting the free press of America 
to survive. 

We feel that our position is reason- 
able. We hope that you agree and 
will write your Congressman accord- 
ingly. It would please us to have a 
copy of your letter^

^■y^HE President of the United 
AStates was an alien. 

Ross Harriman was what they 
called him and he let them. His 
own name "had a decidedly foreign 
flavor. 

The record stated that he had 
been born in Madison, Wisconsin, 
in 1945, and after a half-century of 
reasonably honest living and 
politicking had come to be Vice 
President. On the death of Pres- 
ident Ashby, Harriman became 
President 

The President of the United 
States cannot, of course, legally be 
an alien. Article II, Section I of the 
Constitution clearly states: “No 
person except a natural born Citi- 
zen of the United States. shall 
be eligible to the Office of Pres- 
ident; neither shall any person 
. who shall not have attained to 
the age of thirty-five years. .” 

In point of fact Harriman, who 
called himself something that 
sounded like Braxn, had not been 
born at all. He had been budded 
about six months before stepping 
into office on an interstellar survey 
vessel just out of the Vega system 
and had eased into the first stage of 
maturity about a week before 
the ship reached our solar system 
and went into orbit around Earth. 

The problem of Braxn’s nation- 
ality would have interested quite 
a few people, as there was a 
pregnant woman on Tranquility 



Base and there would no doubt 
soon be another on Tsiolkovski. 
The jus sanguinis argument was 
somewhat simplified in Braxn’s 
case, as he had only one parent, 
his bud-father Brohass, who was 
a “pure-blooded” G’drellian. The 
jus soli, or place of birth, argument, 
however, was most complicated 
Braxn began life somewhere on a 
non-Euclidian geodesic stretching 
from Vega to Earth through 
seventeen distinct (of course) 
dimensions. 

Braxn could probably have made 
a point for claiming himself a citi- 
zen of either Vega system or Sol 
system. But the inhabitants of one 
were pre-literate gibbering savages 
and the inhabitants of the other not 
much better — so he had let the 
option go and remained a 
G’drellian. 

Outside of legal fiction, of course, 
Braxn could only be a G’drellian 
and would never wish to be any- 
thing else. The inhabitants of 
G’drell were about the most gifted 
creatures in the galaxy — the best 
shape-changers and quickest learn- 
ers, very good philosophers and 
mathematicians, virtually (abso- 
lutely, they claimed) immortal, 
powerful telepaths, competent 
humorists, sometimes talented 
weather forecasters and inventors. 
A G’drellian invented the drive 
all interstellar ships use — it has 
a moving part but doesn’t wear 
out. Neither does it use anything 
as cumbersome as fuel. Every adult 



8 



GALAXY 




G’drellian understands the prin- 
ciple behind the drive. But 
they’ve never been able to explain 
it to anybody else — or so they 
claim. 

So — at an age when a human 
child is barely able to focus his 
eyes and reach for a bottle, Braxn 
was teaching quantum mechanics 
to a class of Oxford upperclass- 
men. When that calling began to 
seem dull to him — after one 
afternoon — he became a cutthroat 
bandit on the Trieste waterfront. 
That preoccupation lasted almost 
a whole day. And so on. 

During his first stage of develop- 
ment Braxn, like all G’drellian 
children, was after variety in 
experiences. The one thing common 
to all his little experiments in 
living was that he either inflicted or 
experienced pain or discomfort — 
from simple embarrassment to 
excruciating death. These sensa- 
tions he arranged into a system of 
esthetics that was, to say the 
least, incomprehensible to mere 
sane humans. 

To an adult G’drellian, though, 
they were on the order of 
fingerpaintings. 

T hroughout this childish 

stage the immature G’drellian 
is protected from real harm by a 
considerable ability to manipulate 
time and space, matter and energy 
by purely mental effort. He could 
repair damaged tissues by transmu- 



tation of any available matter or, 
if given warning, simply teleport 
out of harm’s way. 

While learning about pain 
Braxn destroyed several hundred 
sentient creatures. And in his 
lovable childlike way he felt no 
more remorse for them than a 
zoologist feels for the specimens 
he dissects. Less. 

A time came when Braxn had 
reached a plateau of sophistication 
in dealing with the illusions (to 
him) of pain and death. He was 
now ready to pass on to the next 
phase of his education — the 
manipulation of power. 

At this particular moment of 
history — the last decade of the 
twentieth century — two laborato- 
ries of sufficient size and scope 
existed for Braxn to use as a base 
for his investigation of power. 
One was the fifty-two United 
States of America and the other 
was what was loosely called The 
Eastern Bloc — forty-nine or fifty 
(the number changed every now 
and then) countries and fractions of 
countries which at least paid lip 
service to the ideals of Marx and/ 
or Mao and/or Lenin. 

When Braxn had to make the 
choice he was in the state of New 
York, which is closer to Washing- 
ton than to Novymoscva. The 
effort required to teleport was 
more important to him than the 
minuscule difference he saw be- 
tween communism and capitalism, 
between oriental inscrutability and

occidental brashness. So he became 
President. 

It took him less than a microsec- 
ond to elect himself. 

First he killed the President by 
the simple expedient of wishing a 
heart attack 'on him. He disposed 
of the Vice President after dupli- 
cating the latter’s body and brain 
and was swished into office by the 
law of succession. The period of 
confusion after the President’s 
death, Braxn reasoned, would 
cover any mistakes he might make 
out of inexperience. Besides, he 
had at his disposal all of the politi- 
cal acumen stored up in the former 
Vice President’s brain. 

Unfortunately, as is often the 
case with Vice Presidents, this 
was not much. But the personal 
details were useful. 

Braxn stumbled through the 
first hours of office, giving a 
convincing imitation of a bewil- 
dered Ross Harriman suddenly 
weighed down by grief and a 
crushing burden of responsibility. 
By 3:00 a.m., after numberless 
conferences, speeches, comfortings 
and a few genuine surprises — 
China turned out not to have 
been behind the newest Pakistan 
conflict — the army of advisors, 
well-wishers, reporters and op- 
portunists* let the new Chief 
Executive retire for the night. 

O F COURSE, being a G’drel- 
lian, Braxn needed sleep no 
more than he needed pollen or 



diesel fuel. But he was glad to get 
away from public scrutiny so he 
could relax in a more comfortable 
shape. 

Once satisfied that his suite was 
free of bugs and that he was in no 
danger of sudden interruption, 
Braxn mentally reviewed the 
shapes available in his repertoire. 
He settled on being a Persian rug. 
He had been one before and 
enjoyed the musty taste and the 
soothing colors and the fuzzy feel 
of air wafting over him. He set 
his mind in the Persian rug pattern 
and pushed. 

Nothing happened. He pushed 
again in the familiar way, but 
instead of rolling out on the floor 
in a riot of rich color he stayed the 
same shape and the air in front of 
him shimmered and solidified into 
an image of his father, Brohass. 

Brohass held up a tentacle. 
“Don’t try to say anything, 
Braxn old bud, because the follow- 
ing is a recorded announcement, 
which you triggered by trying to 
change shape. 1 don’t know how 
long you stayed in that dumpy 
Harriman body before you de- 
cided to slip into something more 
comfortable. Doesn’t really make 
any difference. You’re stuck with 
being Harriman for a while — with 
one important exception. 

“While you were an infant, in the 
aesthetic stage of your develop- 
ment, you did quite a bit of violence 
to your environment. This was nec- 
essary for reasons that will one day 



10 



GALAXY 




be quite clear to you. While you 
were on your rampage you had to 
be protected from the possible 
consequences of your violence - 
thus you were given certain of the 
powers of an adult G’drellian. 
These included, but were not 
limited to, transmutation, tele- 
portation, telekinesis and the 
ability to read and manipulate 
the minds of others. 

“Starting now, you may use these 
powers only in a limited way. 1 
command this, as your father and 
as your teacher, because the pres- 
ent stage of your development 
involves the manipulation and ap- 
preciation of power and, being 
virtually omnipotent by the stan- 
dards of this planet’s aborigines, 
you could otherwise no more learn 
about power than one could learn 
to be a gourmet while being con- 
tinually gorged with food. Don’t — ’’ 

“The—’’ 

“ — interrupt. As a G’drellian 
you will, however, enjoy certain 
advantages. Most creatures in 
relatively complete control of their 
environment never get any bal- 
anced appreciation of their power 
— the use of their strengths insu- 
lates them philosophically. You, 
son, will not be limited in this 
wise. You will find that you have a 
new talent. It will enable you to 
feel directly the effects of wielding 
power You may not like it — its 
application will be random and 
painful. 1 leave for you to discover 
its nature on your own. 



“One word of warning. Don’t 
attempt to use freely your ability 
to transfer personality from one 
body to another. It could be 
dangerous. Because you can die 
in this phase of your growth.’’ 

Die? Braxn had seen hundreds 
of animate beings die, but it had 
never occurred to him that he 
himself might perish. 

“Yes, you can die. G’drellians 
are immortal only after the fourth 
pha.se. You may die and, to be 
perfectly candid, your death 
would upset me no more than if 
you had aborted as a bud. You are 
still an imperfect, unformed 
organism. Anyhow, about the 
personality transfer. If Harriman’s 
body dies — you will die. Even if 
you transfer and leave Harriman 
behind you will still die if Harriman 
does — and in addition you will 
share the dangers of another body. 

“It’s not an easy phase to go 
through, Braxn. 1 well remember 
my own power stage. But I’m confi- 
dent you can handle it. I’m looking 
forward to assessing your progress 
some months or years from now — 
when the ship returns to pick you 
up. Until then — learn and grow.” 

T he image of the' octopoid 
figure faded out and the 
telephone chimed. Braxn glared at 
it and savagely punched the 
FULL VIEW button. 

“Mr. President — Senator Tweed 
says he has to see you immediately.” 
“Damn it, Fred!” Braxn 



POWER COMPLEX 



11 




exploded. “Tell Tweed he can see 
me in the morning. It’s been too 
damn rough a day for me to sit up 
here and choke on his infernal 
Italian cigar smoke.” 

“Well, sir — 1 don’t mean to 
appear to — ufi — ” 

“Goddamn it, Fred, you never 
minced words with the old man. 
Show me the same consideration. 
Spit it out.” 

“Sir, Senator Tweed is the 
majority leader 

“And I’m the minority 
President.” 

“Yes, sir. And he’s very con- 
scious of protocol — or at least the 
overt formalities. You must see him 
before you receive any other 
member of Congress.” 

“Jesus Christ.” Braxn slid the 
old-fashioned hornrims off his 
face and knuckled an eye in a well- 
known gesture. “Mana.” 

“Sir?” 

“I’ve got mana. Anthropologist’s 
word.” Fred looked at Braxn in a 
subtly different way and Braxn 
thought. You ignored old Harri- 
man while you were Ashby’s right 
hand — now you’re surprised to 
find out that he might be more than 
just a harmless puppet. “Tweed 
wants tc be first in line while the 
magic’s still fresh — or something. 
I read about it somewhere.” 
Braxn stared thoughtfully at 
Fred’s image. He knows I’m 
backing off. Does he know I know 
he knows? “Hell, send him in. 
Call the plant and have ’em turn 



the airco all the way up. Make it 
as noisy as possible.” He grinned 
at the screen and clamped the 
glasses back on. “Maybe the old 
bastard forgot his hearing aid.” 

A secret service man conspicu- 
ously armed with a high-energy 
laser tube opened the thick oak 
door and ushered in Arthur Tweed. 
The majority leader was an old 
man who in the right light could 
have looked like an old woman - 
shoulder-length stringy hair framed 
his wrinkled and bony features. 
But he strode through the door not 
at all like an octogenarian kept 
up six hours past his bedtime. He 
crinkled a smile at Braxn that 
lasted until the door whispered 
shut. Then eighty-three years 
dropped like a frayed cloak over 
Tweed’s frail body and his grin 
became a spinster’s smile. 

Braxn ignored the switch from 
the college-boy routine. Tweed 
was a veteran actor who knew 
that not even Presidents were 
immune to pity. 

“Good of you to see me at this 
hour, Ross,” Tweed offered. 

Braxn raised an eyebrow. 
Tweed had known Harriman for 
eighteen years and had never used 
Harriman’s first name before. 

Braxn waited a fraction of a 
second longer than was polite 
before replying, “My pleasure. 
Senator. Please pull up a chair.” 
Purely rhetorical — the old man 
didn’t look strong enough to pull 
up his own drawers.

GALAXY 




Tweed perched himself on the 
edge of an overstaffed chair to 
Braxn’s right. “I’ve already of- 
fered you my official condolences, 
but please let me — ’’ 

Braxn cut him short with a chop 
of his hand. 

“Skip it. You didn’t like the old 
bastard any more than 1 did.” 

“Uh -huh!” The Senator slid 
back in his chair. “Huh -huh” 
It took Braxn a second to realize 
Tweed was laughing. “That's what 
1 like huh huh — a man who 
speaks his mind — huh!” 

Just what you don’t like, you 
devious old fool. 

T weed reached into his vest 
pocket and extracted a short 
black Toscani cigar. The sulfurous 
vapor from the wooden match was 
balm to the nose, compared to 
what followed. The airco cut in at 
just the right moment, loudly. 
Tweed looked at Braxn through 
narrowed eyes. 

“You can’t be feeling the heat, 
Ross.” 

“No.” Braxn pushed an immac- 
ulate silver ashtray across the desk 
to Tweed. “Is this just a social 
visit or do you have something in 
mind?” 

“Mnh. Well, no. I’m here about 
a bill, the Selective Service re- 
newal — Ashby was going to sign 
it tomorrow.” 

“Really?” Braxn smiled. 

"’Yes, damn it! He— we talked 
him into it.”

THE GoH at the LAC on this year is the 
fellow who introduced us to the whole 
world of science fiction — he and Flet- 
cher Pratt, that lovable marmoset. 
Between Fred Poh! and Fletcher, we 
got to meet everybody. Fred edited the 
classic STAR series that introduced us 
to the s-f world. AH originals they were, 
and really great stuff. So to celebrate 
with Frederik Pohl. master copysmith 
of them all, we are reissuing the STAR 
series (all six in one glup — with fan- 
tastic covers by Berkey), along with 
Fred's latest collection for us. The Star 
At The Rainbow's End. AH ready for 
the Con. This is his ninth collection and 
the 34th book to appear on the BB list 
either authored by, co-authored by, or 
edited by Frederik Poh! (under his own 
name, that is. More than 34 if you 
count pseudonyms). Mr. Poh! is a very 
impressive person, a highly sophisti- 
cated writer with an IQ of ISO. and a 
great speaker. But mostly we love 
him and are delighted he's GoH. And 
it is somehow fitting that Fred is still 
aboard ^f or the twentieth anniversary 
in our Ballantine Books incarnation. 
Blessings on you. Frederik and Carol.

LEST you. gentle reader, imagine that 
Fred is the only fellow we publish, 
we'd better quickly tell you of the other 
titles appearing in July and August. 

IN JULY— The Night Land. Vols. I & II, 
by that crazy William Hope Hodgson, 
a Women's Lib nightmare. Shades of 
My Precious Baby Slave, ye Gods. 
Along with William, a splendid anthol- 
ogy unimaginatively (but accurately) 
tided Best Of The Year and edited by 
(of course) Terry Carr.

IN AUGUST, the third volume of the 
Mebinogion myth — The Song Of Rhi- 
annon — by thet remerkmble ledy. 
Evangeline Walton, who continues to 
surprise us with the strength, individ- 
uality and stature of each succeeding 
volume. You keep thinking she just 
can't do it again, and then she quietly 
goes ahead and does. Miss Waiton is 
one of the joys of being a pubiisher. 
Un case you're wondering, from the 
bitching in our last column, why we go 
bravely on). She really is superb, and 
one of these years some Johnny-come- 
Lateiy out there in the mainstream is 
going to discover her. In the meantime, 
ail you fortunate and intelligent 
science-fiction freaks, be sure you have 
all three Evangeline Walton volumes — 
The Island Of The Mighty, The Children 
Of Uyr, and now The Song Of 
Rhiannon. 

August sees a new R. W. Mackelworth, 
startling us with an exercise in extra- 
ordinary logic, Starflight 3000 — a bril- 
iiant extrapolation.

INCIDENTALLY, we are celebrating 
our 20th Anniversary with the reissue 
of fifteen topnotch BB titles. They'll 
be appearing in their own speciai rack 
in August — ail with brand new covers,

“Tripling the draft call?” 

“Of course. If we don’t, Paki- 
stan’s bound to go under.” 

“Bull — twangy.” Braxn took a 
cigarette out of the ornate case on 
the desk and waved it alight. “Ash- 
by never believed that. If you be- 
lieve it you’ve been listening to your 
own speeches.” 

“Huh! Nevertheless, 1 think you 
may want to reevaluate your own 
position, Ross.” 

“Cut and dried. Senator. It’s 
another Vietnam. We’re pulling 
out as soon as — ” 

“Ross, you were a military man, 
weren’t you?” 

“You know damn well I was. 
West Point — and I’m still a mili- 
tary man, incidentally.” He smiled. 
“Comm ander-in-Chief. ’ ’ 

“Ah. Yes, Purple Heart, I be- 
lieve. Silver Star. For bravery. In 
Vietnam.” 

“That’s right.” 

“You were a real cracker] ack 
combat officer.” 

“Get to the point.” 

“Yes.” Tweed blew a leisurely 
ring that floated a foot and broke 
up in the air currents. “A man has 
to have honorable military service 
before he can think of running for 
office. It’s the American way. 
Combat, preferably. I was in 
Korea, of course.” 

“Of course.” 

“Honorable service.” Tweed 
blew another smoke ring. 

“The point?” 

“Yes. A — uh - man came to my

office tonight. With a series of 
photographs.” 

“How intriguing.” 

“The man was your copilot, 
Ross, when your helicopter went 
down during a mission and you 
won the Silver Star defending it.” 
“And?” 

“The photographs, yes. They 
indicate that your helicopter was 
not shot down it was grounded by 
mechanical failure. And that your 
wound was self-inflicted.” 

“Get out.” 

“Now just a minute, Ross — I 
don’t for a second believe — ” 
“Out.” 

“1 was just — ” 

“Listen, Tweed. Any military 
doctor can look at that wound even 
now — after thirty years — and tell 
you it came from a fifty-caliber 
machine gun. A man can no more 
‘self-inflict’ a fifty-caliber wound 
than he can shoot himself with a 
howitzer.” 

“Ross, Ross, I know that. 1 told 
you — I don’t for a moment believe 
him. But you know as well as I that 
once the accusation is made — ” 
“What do you — does he — want?” 
“He’s a fanatic militarist, Ross. 
He wants you to sign the draft bill.” 
Braxn laughed — one short bark. 
“I’ll think about it. Tell him I’ll 
think about it.” He rose and glow- 
ered down at the little old man. 
“It was a pleasure speaking to you. 
Senator.” 

Tweed levered himself out of the 
chair and laid the smoldering cigar 



in the little silver bowl. “I hope 
you’ll be in touch with me.” 
“Goodbye, Senator.” When the 
man had disappeared behind the 
wall of oak Braxn punched the 
phone for Fred. “What do we have 
on old Tweed?” 

“Almost nothing, Mr. President. 
He has a mistress, but he’s had her 
for thirty years. She’s ugly as sin.” 
“Hauling her out would gain him 
more votes than she would cost 
him. Put some of the staff to work 
on him. Then you get some sleep. 
I’m going to do the same.” 

B raxn left his office and, ac- 
companied by the ubiquitous 
secret service guard, retired to his 
personal quarters. The guard 
stayed outside the door. 

“Thanks, Captain.” He closed 
the door gently so as not to awaken 
Harriman’s wife, now presumably 
asleep in the master bedroom. They 
wouldn’t be moving upstairs to the 
executive apartments, of course, 
until Elizabeth Ashby moved out. 

Braxn strode into the study and 
sat down at the huge desk. The 
antique dverstuffed swivel chair 
groaned and squeaked a pleasant 
fugue of old bearings and new 
leather. He started at the top of 
the stack of papery overflowing the 
IN box. 

“Ross?” Standing in the door, in 
the half-light from the desk lamp, 
Linda Harriman looked almost 
pretty. She stepped closer and the 
illusion vanished.

“’Morning, darling.” Braxn 
watched her approach, putting on 
Harriman’s smile of genuine af- 
fection. Thirty years earlier people 
had whispered about “political 
suicide” whqn Ross Harriman had 
married the homeliest girl in Madi- 
son society. But the years that had 
blunted the fragile beauty of her 
contemporaries had been kind to 
her, softening planes and juts into 
gentle curves. 

“You shouldn’t be up.” She took 
the cigarette from his mouth and 
laid it in the ashtray. “Tomor — 
today is going to be hard.” 

“I caught a nap earlier.” He 
turned back to the desk. 

She tugged a curl of his hair. 
“Liar.” She smiled. “Try to get 
some sleep before you jump into 
the fray again.” 

“Okay.” He chuckled and 
squeezed her hand goodbye. 

When she was gone Braxn started 
to riffle through the hundred pages 
of synopses Ashby’s staff had pre- 
pared — summations of bills, per- 
sonal requests, appointments, all 
needing action in the next week or 
ten days. Luckily Harriman had a 
reputation for being a fast reader — 
though with regrettably shallow 
comprehension. 

In a half-hour he had memorized 
the synopses and decided on ten- 
tative courses of action. He reached 
for the phone and tapped out Fred’s 
combination. 

An unfamiliar face peered at him 
from the screen, seemed about to 



phrase a nasty comment, then 
registered recognition. “Oh, Mr. 
President— let me get Mr. Aller.” 

“Don’t wake him up on my ac- 
count. Just checking on some- 
thing.” 

“He’s awake, sir. I’ll get him.” 
After a moment Fred Aller filled 
the screen. His ascot was unkempt. 
He sat down, hollow-eyed and 
stubble-chinned. 

“Damn it, Fred, I told you to get 
some sleep.” 

“I know, sir. Something big came 
up.” 

“Oh? What?” 

“Might be something we can use 
on Tweed.” 

“Then why wasn’t I called?” 

“Sir, I thought you were asleep — 
you need rest as much as I do.” 
Fred’s eyes moved that fraction out 
of line that showed he was staring 
at the screen. “Maybe you didn’t 
need it as much. Still have TV 
makeup on?” 

“Hell, no. Got some uppers from 
the doc. What’s the scoop on 
Tweed?” 

“Same thing he wants to pull on 
you. We have spies — ” 

“What?” 

“ — not in your office, sir, in his. 
Holographic infrared laser bug, 
its optical locus in the glass over an 
eighteenth-century painting Tweed 
thinks has been hanging in front 
of his desk since the Roosevelt 
administration. The first — Teddy.” 

“Same thing, you said. Do you 
mean his war record?”

“That’s right, sir. But in his case 
the facts are more or less verifiable. 
He was commanding a front-line 
infantry platoon in Korea and got 
fragged, hit by a — ’’ 

“ -grenade. Yes, 1 know what 
‘fragged’ means.” 

“Rifle grenade. Anyhow, he was 
evacuated to the rear for treatment. 
There they taped him up and sent 
him to a hospital in Japan, diag- 
nosing neurasthenia.” 

“Shell shock?” 

"Right. That could cost him a 
few vet votes right there. Lots of 
people think that shell shock is just 
a nice word for cowardice. This 
isn’t on his medical record, by the 
way — he covered his tracks pretty 
well. But that’s not half of it. He 
lounged around Japan for a month 
— whoring it up — and then got 
transferred back to Stateside. He 
took a Pentagon job, reporting to 
Walter Reed once a month for 
examination.” 

“I don’t know,” Braxn said. “It’s 
good stuff, but it’s too diffuse. An 
awful lot of people wouldn’t see 
anything particularly reprehensible 
about any of that.” 

“Ah, sir, but the clincher is how 
he got out of Japan. The second in 
command in the hospital was his 
uncle — whom he later got ap- 
pointed to a high place in the army 
medical service — a post the uncle 
held for only three months before 
being discharged for gross incom- 
petence and dishonesty. The infor- 
mation and the link to Tweed are 



fully documented and classified. 
Publication would stir up more 
stink than the Pentagon Papers in 
the seventies.” 

“Hah!” Braxn slapped a palm on 
the desk. “That might do it. Can 
you get me a package of evidence, 
photocopies and such, before 
noon?” 

“Already made up, sir.” 

“Wonderful. Call the old bas- 
tard’s secretary and tell him that 
the President desires the Senator’s 
company for lunch tomorrow.” 

II 

T he White House chef had 
prepared a mild Chicken Kiev, 
in deference to Tweed’s aging 
entrails. The two men washed it 
down with a white Bordeaux 
not a bad wine but not quite 
as good as the most junior Senator 
of the President’s party would 
have gotten. 

Both men were in formal black. 
Soon after lunch they would have 
to get into their respective 
limousines and join the cortege 
bearing Ashby’s remains down 
Pennsylvania Avenue Mall, cleared 
of pedestrian traffic for the oc- 
casion, around to the Lincoln Me- 
morial and across the bridge to 
Arlington Cemetery. Braxn re- 
flected that Tweed would have no 
trouble looking appropriately sad 
once he saw the contents of the 
manila folder sitting in the back 
seat of his waiting car. 



POWER COMPLEX

After lunch Braxn escorted 
Tweed to the secluded atrium that 
Ashby had caused to be built 
shortly following his inauguration. 
It was a pleasant green place to go 
to relax and v^as incidentally filled 
with disrupters and noise gener- 
ators in every frequency, which 
made it totally impossible to bug. 
The slight hiss and hum where the 
little watchdogs spilled over into 
audible frequencies was nicely 
masked by a soothing miniature 
waterfall. 

Braxn produced brandy and of- 
fered the old man a Havana. 

“No, thanks, Ross. I used to 
smoke ’em before you were born. 
But we went into that embargo 
nonsense when I was just getting 
started in politics and I had to lose 
my taste for them.” He accepted 
the brandy, though. Braxn lit up a 
Havana and Tweed ignited a black 
Toscani. 

“A pity to rush a good cigar,” 
Braxn said, taking a deep puff and 
letting the smoke trickle out of one 
corner of his mouth. “But I suppose 
we have some business.” 

“Business, yes. Yes.” 

“Your — ah — your photographer 
friend?” 

“Yes, hum, he says he’s having 
bids submitted by TimelLife 
and — ” 

“Damn!” Braxn jumped out of 
his chair. 

“Calm down, calm down, Ross. 
You aren’t implicated yet. All 
they’re smelling is — ‘a scandal in- 



volving a high government official.’ 
They’ll be bidding against the 
Times, WPI and the Scanlan 
Syndicate.” 

“And if 1 comply with your — 
his demands, what does he tell the 
firm that wins the bid?” 

Tweed chuckled. The sound fell 
somewhere between a death rattle 
and a pant. “Don’t worry, Ross. 
We have an alternate — ” 

“To throw to the wolves. So 
another member of my party, in- 
stead of me, gets the gaff. An un- 
attractive dilemma. Senator.” 

“No, not one of yours, Ross. One 
of my own.” 

“Not Sam!” 

Tweed answered with a deaths- 
head grin wreathed in gray smoke. 

“God! You’re the most — ” 
Braxn sat down and puffed his 
cigar back to life. “No matter. 
You old fox.” As he used it, the 
word conjured up a predator- 
scavenger with needle-sharp fangs 
and bad breath. Braxn stared at 
Tweed through a fragrant blue 
nimbus, then jerked the cigar out 
of his mouth and laughed. 

Tweed jumped. 

‘“Tweed. Oh, Tweed — I don’t 
know many really big mistakes 
you’ve made in your career, but 
this one has got to take the prize. 
You don’t lean on a President — 
not this way.” 

Tweed said quietly, “I’ve made a 
career of leaning on Presidents.” 
“There’s a manila folder on the 
seat of your limousine. You go

down and read it and then decide 
whether to go through — ” 

Tweed smiled. “Bribery?” 

“What a coarse word. No money 
is involved, just a trade. Something 
similar to the commodity you 
hold.” 

“Impossible, Ross. There’s no 
way for you to trade your political 
future for mine. I won’t be running, 
next — ” 

“Bushwah! You’ve been threat- 
ening to retire for twenty years. 
You can no more stop running than 
can an animal caught in a forest 
fire.” 

Tweed finished off his brandy in 
one gulp and stood up. “You 
young — look, Ross, you’re out of 
your league. Why don’t you Just — ” 

“Why don’t you just read the 
damn thing and we’ll talk 
tomorrow.” 

“Maybe. I may have an appoint- 
ment with the gentlemen of the 
press.” 

Tweed turned on his heel and 
stalked out. 

B RAXN felt a coldness in the 
pit of his stomach and was 
startled to realize that he was 
afraid. He had never known fear 
before. He swallowed some brandy 
and the fire fed the coldness. 

“Mr. President?” 

“Ah, come in, Fred. Have a 
drink. It’s going to be a long ride.” 
“Thank you, sir.” Fred poured 
a couple of fingers and sat in the 
chair Tweed had just vacated. “I’ve 



made up a list — here, you’ll want to 
check it.” He handed Braxn a sheet 
of paper. “No banquet, of course, 
after the state funeral, but these are 
the people we’re ‘inviting to 
dinner.’ ” 

Braxn tried to .study the list. It 
named the representatives of some 
twenty countries -he seemed un- 
able to focus his mind on it. Sud- 
denly the world split— and he knew 
what his father had been talking 
about. It was as if only the right 
side of his body were here in the 
atrium and talking to Fred — and 
left side was walking down the steps 
in front of the White House, in- 
habiting an old body full of aches 
and twinges, seeing the cherry 
blossoms through rheumy, jaun- 
diced eyes. 

That young upstart pup

Chauffeur opening rear door, 
touching his cap. “Thank you,

“God knows I’d like to invite

“But if Cuba comes, then what

German'y? And if East Ger- 
many and Cuba get together — ”

came tearing in with a glass. 

“It’s all right, Fred.” Braxn held 
up a wavering hand, refusing the 
water. “As I say, it’s happened — ” 
Fred’s sleeve buzzed. He set down 
the water and talked to his bracelet. 
“I’m busy, damn it. What?” 
“Tweed’s had a heart attack. 
Right in front here.” 

Braxn didn’t move a muscle. 
“Get that dossier.” 

“God, that’s right, that’s what — ” 
he spoke to the bracelet. “Manila 
folder on the seat of Tweed’s car. 
Get it if you have to steal the car.” 
Fred turned to Braxn. “Guess I’d 
better go down — make sure the 
area’s cordoned off. And have 
somebody grind out a short speech 
for me to give to the reporters. 

“I imagine Tweed’s too old for 
another transplant or implant.” 
“Probably.” 

“Hopefully,” Braxn whispered. 
The two of them went off to the 
elevator. 

Other members of the cortege 
were standing around, speaking in 
low murmurs, mostly French and 
English. The scene had the quality 
of a theater-of-the-absurd funeral 
as if a state figure had died on cue, 
rows of black limousines and pla- 
toons of mourning dignitaries al- 
ready arranged for. Or as if the 
body had been on the way to its 
hearse and had been carelessly 
dropped on the sidewalk. 

The only man not dressed in 
black was the White House physi- 
cian, who wore a conservative twill 



one-piece. His oxblood coverall 
didn’t look out of place. Braxn had 
a mental image of a tribe of savages 
mourning their newly dead prince, 
red daubed witch doctor speeding 
his soul to wherever. 

“Any chance?” 

“No, Mr. President. He’s been 
on borrowed tissue for fifteen years. 
At his age, with his habits, it should 
have worn out long ago.” 

Braxn looked at the old man he 
had just fought with and killed. 
Grayish skin, blue lips pulled open 
in wide surprise, eyes red slits where 
somebody had closed them — the 
hands were dead white claws on 
scrawny chest. The smell of cheap 
cigar smoke competed with em- 
barrassing evidence of final peri- 
staltic surge. 

A ground-car ambulance pulled 
up over the front lawn. After it had 
taken away the body Braxn entered 
the limousine directly behind the 
hearse and led the cortege off 
across the river. 

(Not to surprisingly, even after a 
lifetime of scrupulous churchgoing, 
Tweed admitted in his will to hav- 
ing always been an atheist and 
wanting no part of the barbaric 
practice of having his bones planted 
in magic ground. He preferred 
antiseptic cremation — his ashes 
were to be scattered in the Potomac 
by his lifelone companion, chauf- 
feur and manservant, Harry Doyle. 
Unfortunately, the Environmental 
Services Commission pointed out, 
that rite was against the law. Gently

but firmly it reminded Tweed’s 
estate that the Potomac is not the 
Ganges. At least not in Washington. 

(Of course, the Potomac also 
runs through Maryland on its 
course to the. Chesapeake Bay. So 
Harry was dispatch^ with the urn 
to nearby Charles County and 
Indian Rock to scatter Tweed’s 
ashes not so very far downstream 
from his beloved Capitol. 

(Harry, who had always hated 
the old man’s guts, got as far as 
Waldorf, where he flushed the ashes 
down a toilet in the men’s room of a 
Gulf station. Then he drove on to 
Indian Rock and drank a sixpack 
while watching the Potomac flow 
sluggishly by.) 



Ill 

T he tea following the funeral, 
went quite well. The dinner 
afterward — attended by enemies, 
switch-hitters and the unaligned 
— was occasionally marred by 
dignified argument, strained 
through the teeth. 

During the tea the Pakistani 
ambassador implored Harriman 
to sign the draft bill. Braxn told 
him bluntly that the bill in its 
present form, tripling the draft 
call, would put a severe strain on 
American manpower. Besides, it 
would be political suicide — a Gal- 
lup taken the week before showed 
that 39% of Americans wanted us 
to withdraw the 75,000 advisors 



already there and 11% wanted us 
to throw our support over to Tibet. 

Braxn vetoed the bill the next 
day, as almost everyone but Tweed 
had expected. 

A compromise bill, doubling 
the draft quotas, had been intro- 
duced earlier. It fizzled out by 
negative vote on engrossment and 
third reading. 

The third and final draft bill was 
a complicated mess of new appor- 
tionment criteria, full of obfusca- 
tory rhetoric and pages of figures. 
But if you sat down with a blue 
pencil and an adding machine 
you found it boiled down to another 
compromise. 

“This bill — ’’ Braxn tapped the 
folder with a pencil, “is alwut the 
best you’re going to get out of this 
Congress. I’m not sure that you’ll 
get even this, though. I, for one, 
need more justification than 
Pakistan.’’ 

“You’ve got it, sir.” The man 
who said it was a burly, bullet- 
headed, craggily handsome soldier 
with so many stars on his shoulders 
that he had to call only one man 
“sir.” 

“The general’s right, Mr. Presi- 
dent.” The secretary of defense 
was a slim, bland-looking man who 
looked as if he might be an insur- 
ance executive or the dean of a 
small law school. He had in fact 
been both. He had never been a 
soldier. “We realize you probably 
haven’t had time to read the entire 
report — ”

“I’ve read it. I’m still not 
convinced.’’ 

“Well, it convinced me,” the 
secretary said. “We’ve got to think 
of the future — ’’ 

“ — in the light of the nineteen- 
ninety-five Geneva Accords espe- 
cially,” the general interrupted. 
“We’re going to be headed for 
bad trouble if — ” 

“Wait, wait,” Braxn waved a 
hand at both of them. “1 under- 
stand the argument. You assume 
there will never be another Two 
Chinas War -that the Geneva 
Accords forbidding the use of 
certain weapons in international 
conflict make our technologically 
oriented weaponry obsolete. That 
we ought to retool down, train 
fewer troops no troops eventually 
— in the use of sophisticated weap- 
ons. We must, in effect, ‘detoxify’ 
our military.” 

The general snorted loudly, re- 
covered himself, hastily made 
answer in an urgent voice. 

“Sir, that’s not it at all. Begging 
your pardon, sir — we plan to keep 
the modern weaponry in the event 
that the Accords break down. But 
more and more men have to be 
allotted to infantry and regular 
artillery if we’re going to be able 
to cope with these brush-fire wars 
between small countries.” 

“And to be frank about it,” 
the secretary said, “we need Paki- 
stan. We need to not only stay 
there but increase our involvement 
— otherwise we aren’t going to have 



the nucleus of experienced men 
and officers we’ll need if a real 
war comes up.” 

“I think you’re both unduly 
alarmed. General, approximately 
what percentage of our forces are 
combat veterans?” 

“Well, sir, damn it, nearly sixty 
per cent. But that doesn’t mean 
anything! Most of those men got 
their combat experience in the 
Two Chinas War. You can’t blame 
them for thinking in terms of nukes 
and lasers and disruptors — not 
bullets and C-six lousy five- 
hundred pound bombs! They’re 
just plain ill-equipped — ” 

“Then haul ’em back and 
teach ’em. General! Oh, hell — ” 
he tossed the pencil down on the 
bill — “I assume you both know 
that this bill is going to pass 
whether 1 veto it or not. By the 
narrowest of margins, of course — 
the Senate wants a stronger mili- 
tary, but it doesn’t want to seem 
hawkish to the folks at home. To 
the people who are going to be 
drafted. 

“I’ll think about it. I’ll keep 
thinking about it. Gentlemen, I 
hate to seem abrupt, but we just 
aren’t getting anywhere. Besides, 
I have some very important hand- 
shaking to do.” 

Both men rose. “Well, thank 
you for taking time out to listen 
to us, sir,” the general said. “Again 
I urge you to — ” 

Braxn cut him short with a wave 
and a smile. “I may. Goodbye.”

AS SOON as the men disap- 
peared Braxn took out his 
pen and looked at the document 
without seeing it. / wonder if either 
of them understands, he thought, 
that it’s not really a military ques- 
tion at all. His problem had to do 
with his relations with Congress. 
Since he had gotten to the Presi- 
dency essentially through a gover- 
norship, Harriman did not have 
many real friends in the legislature. 
They were testing him with this 
bill, knowing there would be a lot 
of noise when the public deciphered 
it and found out that it meant 
larger draft calls all around. He 
could make them pass it over his 
veto and come out lily-white. Or he 
could sign the damn thing and take 
some of the heat off Congress. 

The old-fashioned flatnib foun- 
tain pen scratched loudly on the 
parchment. Anachronisms, Braxn 
thought and punched his secretary’s 
desk. 

“Send in the Scouts and feed me 
the speech, Joyce.” He turned up 
the gain slightly on the receiver 
built into his eyeglass frame. The 
Boy Scouts were his last formal 
appointment of the day. 

He gave it about ten minutes, 
parroting the words and actions 
that his secretary fed to him. 
Twelve Eagle Scouts in full regalia, 
their scoutmaster in mufti, regis- 
tered attention and respect. Braxn 
amused himself by imagining what 
the spindly little man would look 
like in the traditional shorts and 



a Teddy Roosevelt hat. From Har- 
riman’s memory he dragged up a 
half-century-old image of Wally 
Cox playing Mr. Peepers. 

After the Scouts had gone he 
punched Fred’s combination. 

“Oh, hello, sir.” 

Without preamble: “1 signed 
the goddamn thing.” 

Fred nodded soberly. “No 
choice, really. Let’s hope Congress 
handles it right.” 

“Well, I’m knocking off for the 
night.” Braxn reached for the 
switch. 

“Oh wait, sir, just a second. One 
thing might not be going too — ” 
“Too well?” 

“Well — yes, that’s the word. 

One of my men got the dossier on 
Tweed, slipped it off the back seat 
of the limousine while everybody 
was watching the old man die. I 
checked it over, though, and the 
last page is missing. A Xerox of an 
old photostat of his Army psychi- 
atric profile.” 

“You rechecked the car?” 

“We took the damn thing apart 
a couple of hours ago. No sign.” 
“I guess we just sit tight. What 
about the helicopter pilot?” 

“No sweat. We found him this 
morning holed up in a fleabag 
hotel in Philadelphia. He was 
scared, sir, almost out of his mind. 
He was sure we’d killed Tweed 
and were after him. We persuaded 
him otherwise.” 

“You were not too convincing, 
I hope.”

“Naturally not. We also pur- 
chased the article from him, just 
as a safeguard. Ten thousand 
bucks — about a tenth what he 
was going to get. Took the money 
out of the party’s campaign fund 
chalked it up to ‘ghost writing.' " 
“All this and a lousy sense of 
humor, too.” 

“Yes, sir,” Fred said with a little 
smile. 

B RAXN returned the draft 
bill to its black leather case 
and gave it to his secretary on the 
way out, instructing that a courier 
run it over to the Speaker’s office. 

Braxn’s wife met him at the door, 
trading him a glass of chilled Tavel 
for his coat. 

“Hard day today, dear?” 
“Humph.” He sat down in an 
overstuffed recliner. “Conferences. 
Audiences. Two secretaries. Four 
Congressmen, a general, two 
ambassadors and twelve Macedon- 
ians in full battle array. Actually, 
1 think they were Boy Scouts.” 
“Sounds exciting.” 

“It was. 1 must have woken up 
twice. What’s for dinner?” 

“Oh, Rosa’s fixed something 
special. A secret.” She spoke into 
her watch. “Rosa? When can 
dinner be served?” She put the 
watch up to her ear. “Whenever 
you’re ready, dear,” she said to 
Ross. 

He had picked up a copy of the 
Star nitefax. He refolded it along 
the original crease and tossed it 



down. “Let’s go. 1 could eat a 
can of dog food.” 

“That won’t be necessary for a 
while, I hope.” 

While they were walking to the 
dining room the world shimmered 
and split again. 

It was dawn in Barisal, the 
least likely time for an ambush. 
Besides, most of the fighting 
had been confined to the city 
proper, so the Americans .

An artillery spoUing-round 
popped maybe two hundred 
meters away. The captain 
was lying beside a dead radio- 
man, talking on the horn 
while he looked at the map. 
“Drop one-zero-zero and fire

“Oh, now look! You’ve got

O — God . Jesus Christ, 
make it stop . The ground 
fell away and slapped back, 
twice, four times — so loud you 
didn’t hear it with your ears 
but with your lungs and guts 
and bones and balls . 

Braxn rose from the table 
and supported himself with a 
hand on the chair back. “I’m 
going to lie down for a while.” 

“Let me come rub your 
back.” 

“No, finish supper. I’ll just 
lie- ” 

“Ten-six — Doc! Ten-six?” 

Wonder why it doesn’t hurt . 

I always thought it would hurt 
so much but you cant put’em

Braxn closed the door to

B raxn was lying in a stand 
of elephant grass, gray-white 
smoke clinging to the ground 
around him, soft yammer of battle 
sounds whispering in his ears. 
Bluish intestines spilled through 
a foot-wide wound in his abdomen. 

He willed his hands sterile and 
carefully rolled the guts back into 
the abdominal cavity. With his 
fingers and his, mind he debrided 
the wound and held the bloody 
lips of it together for a few seconds 
until it healed. He cleansed him- 
self internally against peritonitis, 
then fixed the broken eardrums. 
Now for the larger problem.

Could he still affect the rate of 
subjective time flow? He con- 
centrated on slowing down this 
little corner of the universe. Make 
it lazy. Come on. Reality, isn’t 
it hard to support a war? So much 
noise and * confusion. Easier just 
to let it all . run . down . 

A machine gun about ten meters 
in front of him was firing at a 
hysterical cyclic rate — dubdubdub- 
dub — belt-fed, rattling off a thou- 
sand rounds per minute. After 
about a hundred rounds it started 
to signal the results of Braxn’s 
efforts. 

Dubdubdub - dub - dub — dub — 
dub, doob, doob. .doomb. Thud. 

Braxn stood up and walked 
through the grass to the machine 
gun. He was halfway there when a 
bullet crawled through the air 
toward him, moving with the speed 
of an overfed bumblebee. He 
caught it between two fingers and 
lifted it — it was heavy with fos- 
silized kinetic energy — and re- 
leased it above his head. It glided 
on. 

Another bullet was just coming 
out of the muzzle when he reached 
the gun. He swatted the slug into 
the ground. No wonder the gunner 
had been firing hysterically — a 
piece of shrapnel had hit him in 
the face and spirited away his nose 
and half a cheek. He was in pro- 
found shock and dying. 

Braxn took the necessary ele- 
ments from nearby plants and 
insects and a pinch of dirt and 



fashioned the man a new nose 
and cheek. Of course, it wouldn’t 
look exactly like his old one, but 
at least it was consistent with 
Pakistani somatotypes. 

The gunner’s loader, the man who 
keeps the belt of ammunition feed- 
ing into the gun, was splayed out 
behind the gun with an ugly wound 
in his throat. Braxn healed the hole 
in the trachea, closed the wound in 
the neck and teleported the inspir- 
ated blood out of the man’s lungs. 
Then he visualized the bolt of the 
machine gun and made the firing 
pin disappear. He started to wander 
through the battle area. 

A hand grenade hung suspended 
in midair, imperceptibly rotating 
and falling. Braxn plucked it out of 
the air and unscrewed the top 
assembly. He snapped off the blast- 
ing cap inside, then screwed the 
thing back together, its firing 
mechanism useless, and let il 
continue on its way. 

In all, Braxn deactivated sixty- 
three rifles and pistols and four 
machine guns, eighty-one hand 
grenades and two grenade launch- 
ers. He revived seven dead men and 
healed the wounds of fourteen 
others. One person, who had evi- 
dently sustained a direct hit from 
an artillery shell, he had to leave the 
way he found him- there were no 
pieces larger than a section of liver 
to work with. The all-important 
brain cells were disorganized and 
scattered over an eight-meter 
radius.

Braxn returned the soldier’s body 
to the stand of elephant grass. As a 
final touch he cleaned all of the 
blood and smoke from the battle- 
ground. He laid down and pushed 
his persona back into Harriman’s 
body. 

Ugh. what's that — of course, 
of course — this body's dead— 
or at least not alive. It wasn't 
alive when I took it over. What 
a bother — have to reprogram 
the brain . 

So quiet all of a sudden . 
wait! I was hurt, / was dying 
but O God, sweet Jesus . 

. must be careful in the 
future — if I leave this body 
again — not to leave it too long. 
It'll start to smell . 

“1 know, goddamn it, 1 
can’t get mine to work either — 
stop those bastards — ” 

B raxn stood up Harriman’s 
body and experimentally 
wiggled it around and stretched. 
Everything seemed to be in order, 
but numb and aching. He shuffled 
back into the living room. Linda 
was sitting on the couch, not-read- 
ing a magazine. 

“Oh, Ross. You look just awful 
—come put your head on my lap.’’ 
Braxn did so to humor her, found it 
felt good. “I checked on you while 
you were sleeping. You looked so 



— well — so bad that I called Dr. 
Dean.’’ 

“Ah. Well. It’s not that serious. 
But — ’’ Braxn closed his eyes and 
shook his head. “The bill.’’ 

“What was that, dear?” Linda 
was stroking his forehead with a 
cold wet napkin. 

“The draft bill. 1 shouldn’t have 
let it through.” 

“Didn’t you veto it day before 
yesterday?” 

“No. That was a different one, 
not as sneaky. This one Just 
reapportions various Selective 
Service districts.” 

“But it still increases the draft?” 

“Overall, yes. Lowers it in some 
noisy districts.” 

Linda dipped the cloth in water 
again. “Well, I agree. You should 
have vetoed it -those poor boys. 
Don’t you remember how you felt 
after — ” 

“Yes. Yes, I remember.” He 
squeezed a hand over his eyes. 
“Maybe that’s what’s bothering 
me. But the situation is more 
complicated than that. If I had 
vetoed that bill I’d get nothing — 
absolutely nothing — out of this 
Congress for the rest of my term.” 

“Still—” 

“Oh, still, still! You know a 
President can’t do everything the 
way he wants, the way he knows is 
right, thinks is right — ” 

Dr. Dean came in, followed by a 
worried-looking Rosa. 

“Good evening, Linda, Ross.” 
He moved a chair over beside the

couch and sat down. “What seems 
to be the trouble?” 

“It’s nothing, Joe. Really there 
is noth — ” 

“He almost fainted at the dinner 
table, Doctor.” 

“Linda . , . just a combination of 
not enough sleep and too much 
coffee.” 

“Well, roll up a sleeve and I’ll 
check the hydraulic pressure.” 
Dean wrapped a slender tape 
around Braxn’s arm and checked 
the numbers on a digital readout in 
his bag. “Normal. Pulse a little 
low, but nothing to worry about. 
Here.” He peered at Braxn’s 
retina with an ophthalmoscope. 
“Yes, it definitely is an eye.” He 
checked knee-jerk reflexes and 
took a blood sample. 

“I’ll put this juice in the mix- 
master upstairs. Don’t expect to 
find anything, though — 1 think 
your diagnosis was correct. Dr. 
Harriman. Fatigue, possible over- 
dose of caffeine and nicotine. 
Taking any other drugs?” 

“Not since those uppers you gave 
me last week.” 

“Last ones you’ll get, too. Take 
my advice, Ross, and try to cool it 
a little bit. These eighteen-hour 
days are driving your staff crazy. 
Besides, you’re stuck with this job 
for three more years, maybe even 
seven. You won’t make it to elec- 
tion year unless you slow down.” 

“Hogwash. I’ve never fell belter 
in my life.” 

“I wish you knew how many 



people have said that to doctors and 
keeled over dead the next day. Your 
mind thrives on work, Ross, but 
your body is just the same old kind 
of inefficient machine everybody 
trundles around in.” 

“All right, Joe. I promise to 
sleep till six— at least one morning 
a week.” 

“Well, that’s something. Linda, 
you make him stick to it.”

T he next morning Braxn strode 
to his desk and punched up the 
morning J*oJ/-fax. He found what 
he was looking for on page two. 

SOLDIERS CLAIM BATTLEFIELD 
MIRACLE 

BARISAL (wpi) April 21 At 
dawn today an American patrol 
based in Barisal was ambushed 
by a force of guerrillas, but the 
ambush was foiled by what 
many soldiers swore was a 
“genuine miracle.” Only one 
fatality resulted from what the 
patrol commander, John Carrie 
of Dade City, Florida, de- 
scribed as “an initially hopeless 
situation.” 

Gen. Theodore Howard, 
commander of the American 
base camp in Barisal, has 
ordered a full-scale investiga- 
tion of the incident, saying that 
(cont’d on B28, col2) 

A note on Braxn’s desk read: 
“Urgent you get in touch with me 
soonest — Fred.”

GALAXY 




Braxn punched up Fred. 

“What’s happening?” 

“Too much, sir. You know that 
missing page from the dossier on 
Tweed?” 

“You found it?” 

“It found us. In the person of 
Harry Doyle, Tweed’s old 
chauffeur.” 

“Surely he can’t — ” 

“Reconstruct what happened? 
I’m afraid he did. He knew that 
Tweed was reading something that 
we gave him when he dropped dead. 
Doyle tried to find it after the 
fuss slowed down and only came 
up with the one page. It had slipped 
down behind the seat.” 

“Did he say what he’s going to do 
with it?” 

“That’s the scary part. He said he 
hasn’t decided, but he didn’t even 
hint about taking a bribe. He’s a 
nut, sir, and he hates politicians — 
when he came to Washington 
twenty-five years ago, he had 
political ambitions, took a job 
driving for Tweed just to tide him- 
self over. Never got any further.” 
What a mess.” Braxn stared 
I space for a second, then lit a 
irette. “Any ideas?” 

Yes, sir. We could pull Tweed’s 
trick on him.” 

“Have him committed? Fred, 
this isn’t nineteen fifty-eight. 
Where would we find an old- 
fashioned insane asylum?” 

“Maybe Berne, Switzerland. The 
place is known simply as the 
Institut. It’s a fairly new spa, but it 



has old-fashioned ideas, like 
total isolation of the patient until 
he gets well.” 

“And Doyle’s case?” 

“Poor fellow. He suffers from 
a really deep-rooted psychosis.” 

“I don’t like it, Fred. It sounds 
Big Brotherish.” 

“I don’t care for it either. But the 
alternative, the scandal, would be 
worse. For you and the country.” 
“We can’t just make a person 
drop out of sight like that.” 

“Ah, but we can — all above- 
board and legal. His mother — she’s 
sixty-eight, lives in Sioux Falls and 
is also a nut — would be glad to sign 
the papers. She tried to get him 
committed eight years ago.” 
“You’re very thorough, Fred.” 
“Yes. We have a man in Sioux 
Falls with a Swiss passport and a 
German accent. He has contracts 
that give very attractive terms. He 
will meet Mrs. Doyle at a women’s 
club get-together tomorrow. We 
also took the liberty of putting a 
little something in Doyle’s dinner 
last night. He’ll be heavily sedated 
for twelve hours yet.” 

“And if I give the word he wakes 
up in Switzerland?” 

“That’s correct.” 

“What about t|ie rest of his 
family?” 

“Never married, father dead. 
No friends to speak of.” 

“Okay, go ahead. But I have a 
feeling it’s going to backfire.” 

Fred shrugged. “It seems tight 
enough. And it’s reasonably

humane. In the Eastern Bloc 
they’d just haul him in and shoot 
him.” 

“Well, in China, maybe.” Braxn 
took off his glasses and rubbed his 
eyes. “In Russia they would bundle 
him up and send him off to an 
asylum in Siberia. Or maybe 
Switzerland.” 



AFTER Fred had signed off 
Braxn leaned back and 
thought about yesterday’s sojourn 
in Pakistan. He had learned noth- 
ing new about power through the 
experience. Presumably that was 
not good. He was stuck in this 
uncomfortable phase of his 
development until some internal 
mechanism told him he had 
learned enough. 

Braxn resolved to make a mini- 
mum use of his G’drellian 
abilities, but he saw no real reason 
not to use them at all — his father 
had exaggerated, as usual. The one 
thing he had to remember was not 
to be “away” from the Harriman 
body for too long at a stretch. 

Which brought up an interesting 
question. His father had said he 
could die here if Harriman died. 
But the body had been unquestion- 
ably dead when he had returned to 
it and the fact had caused him no 
great difficulty. His danger had 
to lie in being inside a body 
when it died — Harriman’s or any- 
body else’s. 

He would be careful. 



D uring the next week Braxn 
went through the involuntary 
“dual-life” phenomenon daily. 

As the result of a bill approving 
the (further) devaluation of the 
dollar he lived with a Mexican 
peasant who had been making a 
marginal income by working in 
Laredo, Texas, and crossing the 
border back home every night. 
When the value of American 
currency went down he found that 
his paycheck no londer provided a 
marginal living for his family — 
even before his pay was cut to help 
keep his employer in business. 

To cut down on welfare ex- 
penses, Braxn made it impossible 
for a family to get food stamps if 
the total annual family income was 
over 21% of average U.S. family 
income per adult member, plus 
$1000 per child. For a conventional 
family of two adults and two chil- 
dren, this was quite equitable. 
But Braxn had to live through 
the situation as it presented itself 
to a forty-two-year-old ex- 
prostitute trying to support four 
children, working as a custodian 
for an income barely above the 
minimum for a single adult. She 
solved her problem by teaching her 
twelve-year-old daughter a trade 
and finding old gentlemen willing 
to pay a premium for her services. 

A bill terminating funds for a 
space research project made him 
share the body of a chemist, who 
couldn’t tell his wife, eight months’ 
pregnant, that he had been fired 



32

but instead filled a 500-milliliter 
flask with fuming nitric acid and 
managed to get most of it down 
before he died. Braxn was unable 
to help him and barely succeeded 
in saving his own life. 

A Presidential directive ordering 
energy workers in New York City 
back to work resulted in a brief 
but bloody shootout between the 
“loaf-ins” and the National Guard. 
Braxn got to “be” a teenage 
Guardsman who didn’t want to live 
after an emasculating pistol 
wound in the groin, but did. 

<i ALL right, Mr. Secretary, 
x\. you have about ten 
minutes. Start talking.” 

The secretary of defense lowered 
himself gently into a chair. Prob- 
ably has hemorrhoids, Braxn 
reflected. 

“Mr. President, my staff in- 
formed me only this morning of a 
very disturbing rumor — ” 

“It’s true.” 

“Uh — ha-ha! It can’t be true, 
sir. The rumor concerns a pullout 
of—” 

“Yes.” Braxn slid a five-page 
report across his large desk. “When 
I heard you were coming 1 had a 
copy of this made up for your en- 
lightenment. You’re getting it a 
day early.” 

The secretary picked it up with- 
out looking at it. “We — we’re end- 
ing our involvement in Pakistan?” 

“Correct.” 

“But only a few weeks ago — ” 



“I reluctantly signed a bill raising 
the draft call by a third — but not 
for the defense of a puppet regime 
and not so your brass hats can 
gain experience by playing soldier 
with the lives of American boys. 
The bill was to enhance our overall 
defense posture. Emphasis on de- 
fense — of America, not Zambia, 
Paraguay or Pakistan.” 

The secretary shook his head 
slowly from side to side. “This is a 
terrible mistake.” 

“No, this is the avoidance of a 
mistake. Almost every other 
country learned its lesson from the 
Two Chinas War. Time we figured 
it out, too.” 

Shimmer and split. 

“Is it all right if I have 
another drink?” 

“All right, Doyle, but I wish 
you’d try to get some sleep 
after we change at Kennedy.” 

“You know better than that, 
Mr. Secretary. China will be 
anything but happy. They 
don’t — ” 

“I’m sorry, sir, but we’ll be 
in our landing pattern in a 
couple of minutes.” 

“That’s all right, thank you 
anyhow, miss.” Got to make 
my play at Kennedy. I'll never 
get another chance at that 
bastard Harriman. 

“What are you going to do

33 




with all that Army back in the 
States?” The secretary was up 
and pacing around. “Mark 
my words, without an actual 
war — ” 

... he can’t clap me away in 
some looney bin fulla Krauts 
. “Smooth landing.” 

"Ja." 

“There’s no need to discuss 
this. It’s an executive order 
and you may either comply 
or submit your resignation.” 

Short one that time, Braxn 
thought. 

“I’m not resigning. Not yet. 1 
wouldn’t give you the satisfaction.” 
“Don’t misunderstand me, Mr. 
Secretary.” Braxn said smoothly. 
“1 want you to stay on. 1 need men 
of experience and discernment. 
But I’m not Ashby. 1 have different 
ideas, some of which fall into your 
sphere.” Braxn stood. “I’m only 
telling you that you can learn to 
work with me if you wish. Other- 
wise — the sooner you leave, the 
less prejudicial it will be to your 
political future.” 

“You’ll be hearing from me, 
Mr. Harriman.” 

“I’ll expect to.” 



A lone again, Braxn stabbed a 
c finger at the phone. 

“Good afternoon, sir. What can 
I do for you?” 



“Let me speak to Mr. Aller. 
Very urgent.” 

“Mr. Aller is in Chicago. I’ll 
see if I can patch you through and 
punch you back. All right, sir?” 
“That’s fine.” 

Have to find out what’s with 
Doyle. How did he get out and 
what’s he doing in an airplane 
with a German.^ A Swiss? 

Fred’s image on the screen was 
of poor quality and rolling. “Yes, 
sir? What can I do for you?” 

“Arc you alone?” 

“No sir. I’m in the mayor’s 
limousine — with the mayor. Would 
you like to say hello to him?” 
“Certainly. Phil. How are things

A flaccid fat face filled the 
screen — “Not too well actually, 
Mr. President. The labor 
situation” 

“Ah, yes, I know — that’s why 
I sent you Fred. He’s my right 
arm and half my brain— in fact, 
I can’t get along without him. Can 
you spare him for about an hour?” 
“Sure thing, sir. Fred, we’re 
pretty near your hotel — I’ll just 
drop you there?” 

“Fine,” Fred said off camera. 
“While I’ve got your ear, Mr. 
President — ” Braxn half-listened 
to the old criminal for a couple of 
minutes. Then he said goodbye 
and Fred punched him from the 
scrambled telephone in his hotel 
room. 

“What’s up, sir? World War 
Three?”

“Not till next week. Fred — do 
you believe in intuition?” 

“Why? Did you get a flash about 
something?” 

“Something like that. Maybe I’m 
all wrong — if so, I apologize for 
tearing you away from your pleas- 
ant companions.” 

“Quite all right, sir. I was getting 
cancer of the eardrum.” 

“Anyhow, it’s about Doyle.” 
“Doyle?” 

“Tweed’s man — when did you 
last get a report on him?” 

“Oh, that, that — haven’t heard 
anything since they told me he was 
definitely safe behind bars. Sir, 
you shouldn’t worry. He’s lost to 
the world until — ” 

“Still, I am worried. Take long 
to check?” 

“Well, we shouldn’t call the 
hospital directly. I’ll have my 
German call his mother first.” 

“Do as you think best, Fred. 
But do it fast.” 

“Of course, sir. We’ll get right on 
it and punch you back.” 

“Fine. I’ll be herein my office.” 
After a few minutes Fred came 
back on the screen, worried and 
perplexed. “Sir, it’s weird. We 
tried to get his mother and patched 
into a funeral home. She died yes- 
terday. My man’s calling — wait — ” 
Fred looked to his left, evidently 
at another screen. “Damn it, they 
had orders . Has it left . 
arrived? Check the roster for the 
connecting flight — right.” He 
produced a handkerchief and 



passed it over his face. “Sir, if you 
ever get another flash — listen to it. 
Doyle’s mother died and the In- 
stitut decided that he was stable 
enough to attend the funeral and 
take care of the arrangements. 
They sent him to the U.S., accom- 
panied by an aide. The plane - 
damn it — the plane landed twenty 
minutes ago in New York. My 
man’s checking their connecting 
flight. It’s pretty close — ” 

Fred looked away again and 
swore. Braxn was amused in spite 
of himself. Fred was always so 
cool. “The flight to Sioux City 
has loaded. They aren’t aboard. 
I’ll keep checking.” 

“Okay. I’ll keep worrying. Punch 
me as soon as anything happens.” 
Split again.

“Okay, set it up. Better watch

to concentrate on the thick report

sal down at his desk, the thick 
report unopened before him. He 
stared at the telephone, then 
punched Fred. 

“No word yet, sir.” 

“Nothing?” 

“No, sir. The New York City 
Police are dragging Kennedy. All 
the airlines have his description. 
If he hasn’t left Kennedy we’ll 
find him soon.” 

“We? Or the police?” 

“Sir?” 

“If they catch him they’ll hold 
him for homicide. He’s sure to 
shoot off his mouth. Headlines 
for a week.” 

“Damn.” Fred slapped his head 
twice. “I’m not thinking.” 

“That’s all right, Fred. It was my 
idea to feed his description to 
them. What do you think the 
chances are that he’s still there?” 

“Well, it gels more likely with 
every shuttle that lands without 
him. Another hour at the most and 
we’ll be able to say he definitely 
didn’t — ” 

“ — didn’t lake the shuttle to 
Washington or Baltimore. Could 
he have slipped on another auto- 
mated flight before his description 
went out?” 

“Oh, it’s possible. The other 
shuttles are — let’s see, Newark, 
Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia. 
Might be one to Richmond, but 1 
doubt — ” 

“Any way to check them?” 

“Newark and Boston probably 
have cameras like the one at Ken- 



nedy — lakes pictures of all the 
people debarking from the shuttle 
because of the smuggling. I’ll 
check all of them.” 

“Well, that’s a start. Go ahead.” 

(Harry Doyle left the shuttle in 
Boston and caught a limousine to 
Cambridge. Knowing he couldn’t 
buy a gun with Kramer’s identi- 
fication, he wailed in a bar until 
he saw a man about his own age, 
height and build. He followed the 
man home to his apartment, rang 
the bell and when the man came to 
the door he slashed out with the 
razor blade — a technique he had 
practiced mentally a thousand 
times in Switzerland — pushed the 
silently dying man inside, was 
grateful that he was alone, took the 
man’s wallet and memorized his 
new name and social security num- 
ber, locked the door behind him 
and went down to the street. 

(He called five sporting goods 
stores before he found one that had 
the Weatherby .658 Magnum, an 
elephant gun that was really over- 
kill — even for elephants. He said he 
would be there in a half-hour and 
he was. 

(It took most of Kramer’s Amer- 
ican money to buy the Weatherby, 
a box of shells, a case and shooter’s 
muffs. When all the items were 
wrapped up in brown paper and 
tied, the package didn’t suggest 
a gun at all. Doyle left it in a locker 
in the bus station, went to the pub- 
lic library, looked in Section B of

Harry.) 

. our conclusions were that this 
type of EE station has an optimum 
balancing effect in areas on the 
periphery of an urban heat sink, 
but closer to the .. 

The telephone chimed and Braxn 
punched up visual. 

“Well, sir, we got results from 
Newark and Hartford. The camera 
at Boston had been taken down 
for repairs. Nobody who looks like 
Doyle — ’’ 

“Any way to check Boston?’’ 

“Not after four hours, sir. Big 
town with efficient rapid transit in 
and out. If he slipped through the 
Boston shuttle while the camera 
was down he could be anywhere on 
the East Coast.” 

“That might make things easier 
in a way. I guess we can assume 
he’s crossed state lines pursuant to 
the commission of a — ” 

“The CBI?” 

“Yes. Might as well. We have 
more control over them than over 
the police. Contact the CBI — tell 
them all you have that’s safe for 
them to know. Tell them that Doyle 
is a murderer, is suspected of high 
treason and is armed and dan- 
gerous.” 

“And not to risk taking him 



alive?” Fred’s expression was grim. 

Braxn chewed a nail thought- 
fully. “I think that would be best. 
Tell the director he can call me for 
verification. Patch him through 
your scrambler, though — Oh, and 
Fred, I’m going to try to take a 
little nap. Don’t worry if you can’t 
raise me right off.” 

“Okay, sir.” Fred’s image 
flashed to a point and faded. 

B oston offered one obvious 
course of action. Braxn 
punched up a street map of the city 
and memorized it. Seven million 
people — it would take a week to 
check each one of them by body 
transfer. Besides, Doyle probably 
had left by now. But Doyle had 
been thinking lovingly about a 
Weatherby. 

Braxn made contact with a 
policeman on the beat and — with 
rather more difficulty than last 
time, since he was not in involun- 
tary telepathic contact — slipped 
into the man’s body. 

He found a public telephone and 
started going down the list of 
sporting goods stores in the area. 
People told his uniform, badge and 
beefy Irish face that yes, a man had 
called about a Weatherby, but they 
didn’t have one in stock. The fifth 
store said it had just sold one, not 
two hours earlier, and gave Braxn 
the purchaser’s name and address. 

He took the cop back to his beat 
and transferred to another police- 
man who was on duty near the 



38 



GALAXY 




apartment of the man who had 
supposedly bought the Weatherby. 
He mounted the stairs of the apart- 
ment house and found the right 
door. A dark stain ran along the 
bottom edge. Braxn moved the 
lock tumblers with his brain and 
pushed open the door. 

He investigated the dead man’s 
brain and decided that there was 
still enough there to make revival 
worthwhile. He sealed up the 
jugular and the neck wound, trans- 
muted a steak, a cabbage, two nails 
and a quantity of tap water into a 
sufficient supply of blood, then 
wished away the huge puddle of old 
blood from the Oriental rug and 
parquet floor. It took only a couple 
of minutes to fix up the brain- 
make the man an intelligent am- 
nesiac. As he was coming to, Braxn 
tapped him not too gently on the 
temple with the nightstick to make 
it plausible that the man had been 
merely robbed. 

As, of course, he had been. 

Having gotten exactly nowhere 
so far — except to confirm that 
Doyle would murder without prov- 
ocation — Braxn walked the police- 
man’s body back. On the way he 
scanned the minds of various 
people to see whether any one 
had particularly noticed Doyle. 
No one had, which was not sur- 
prising. Humans did not notice 
much. 

Harriman’s body had been va- 
cant for twelve minutes. Still, 
Braxn found it a chore to revive it.

pull the poisons out of the tissues 
and get everything creaking around

He punched up Fred. “Did you 
reach the director?’’ 

“It’ll be another hour, sir. 1 
talked to his administrative assis- 
tant, who is setting up tentative 
agent assignments. Of course, the 
director must have the final word.’’ 
“All right. I’ll be working on the 
Peace Corps dedication. Couldn’t 
sleep.” 

“Sir, um, maybe you ought not 
to make any public appearances 
until we nail him. He is desperate 
and — ” 

“Yes, I had planned to curtail 
my peregrinations. I’ll keep my 
appointments in the Washington 
area and trust the secret service and 
the CBI. I’ve got two speeches in 
town this week and this one out in 
Columbia. The rest I’ll postpone or 
arrange for a substitute.” 

(In order to look like a casual 
traveler Harry bought an old suit- 
case and filled it with newspapers 
and a supply of sandwich materials. 
Then he went to a trucking firm and 
traded a twenty-dollar bill for a lift 
to Baltimore on a big ground- 
effect rig.)

“Tell him 1 need a rewrite. 1 want 
more about ‘the Administration’s 
changing priorities’ and I want it 
worded so that young people will 
think that the Peace Corps will be 
an alternative to the draft, but older 
people will see it as just a two- 
year deferment.’’ 

“Uh, sir — do you know which it 
will be?” 

“Something in between.” A 
chime rang. “Have to punch off, 
Joyce.” Braxn turned to the other 
telephone. “What is it, Fred?” 

“Just a progress report. Little 
enough progress, but we do have 
the CBI’s full cooperation. The 
director assigned a hundred and 
twenty-two men to the job.” 
“Good.” Harriman had always 
been wary of the power the CBl 
had assimilated — it had had too 
much from its inception in the 
merger of the old CIA and FBI — 
but now Braxn was glad to have it 
on his side. Most C-men came close 
to their public image of remorse- 
less, incorruptible automations. 
No man on Earth could elude more 
than a hundred of them for any 
length of time. 

(Harry got off at a truckers’ stop 
just north of the outer Beltway and 
hitched a ride to Towson. Five 
minutes later two expressionless 
men in charcoal coveralls came into 
the truck stop with a description of 
him. Luckily for him the waitress 
on duty had no love for the law — 
none at all.) 



Braxn had approved a measure 
closing some loopholes in the Capi- 
tal Gains Law a week earlier. He 
lived through two hours of a busi- 
nessman’s fidgeting, worrying, 
waiting for his secretary to go to 
lunch — whereupon he opened a 
window, stepped out and jumped 
1459 feel into a busy Dallas inter- 
section. An experienced skydiver, 
he aimed for a red convertible and 
just missed.

<< ELL, Senator, I did wade 
through the report — ” 
Braxn hefted the inch-thick volume 
— “and I agree with you. We need 
an extensive and uniform environ- 
mental monitoring system all over 
the country to enforce the Clean 
Cities Act. But your ‘EE stations’ 
will cost more than the public will 
be willing to finance. The figure of 
two billion dollars each, from state 
and us — it’s at once too conserva- 
tive and too much.” 

The young Senator was obviously 
uncomfortable. He had been rail- 
roaded into sponsoring this project, 
more on the basis of his lack of 
seniority than because he had evi- 
denced any special interest in the 
environment. It was the first time 
he had sat in the President’s office 
and he acutely wished himself 
elsewhere. 

“Sir, we’re willing to make com- 
promises, but there’s no getting

Equipment below a certain level of 
sophistication just won’t do any

“Compromise.” Braxn put on 
his glasses and leafed idly through 
the report. “Perhaps you could 
make the distribution of the sta- 
tions less comprehensive — set up 
the system first as an experimental 
project covering only a few cities. 
Of course the states chosen would 
balk at having to match funds — ”

“ — get together with your

“Where you headed?” 

Don’t know too much about 
this area. “West, man — ^just 
west.” 

<<T’M SORRY you don’t have 
A more time, Mr. President.” 
The young Senator was glad to get 
away. 

The door whispered shut and 
Braxn locked it from his desk. 
Fifty or sixty miles away, coming 
from Boston, wants to go west 
to “get out into the country.’’ 
Braxn needed no map to tell that 
Doyle was somewhere north of 
Baltimore — probably on route 95, 
695 or 795. Somebody in a ground- 
car had just picked him up. Braxn 
started searching the minds of 
drivers in those areas. 

The telephone chimed and Braxn 
stabbed it. The caller was Fred. 

“Good news, sir — he did land in 
Boston and we know how he got 
out. He bought a ride on a truck 
that was bound for Baltimore. 
They’re intercepting the truck right 
now.” 

“Good. Let me know when they 
find out — ah — if Doyle isn’t in the 
the truck get back to me when they 
find out where he was let off.” 

Braxn continued checking. It 
took him five seconds to locate 
each mind and scan it superficially.

He did a fast multiplication, de- 
cided he faced a day’s work — too 
long. 

Fred called back. “We missed 
him by a few minutes. Driver said 
he thought ’ Doyle was headed 
toward Towson.” 

“Okay stay on it, Fred. I’m 
going to try to take a nap again 
Doc Dean won’t let me take pills 
and I just can’t seem to sleep at 
night.” 

“All right, sir. I won’t call unless 
it’s really big.” 

Braxn scanned Towson and 
decided to take over a policeman’s 
body again. A uniform would 
take him Just about anywhere. 

He rode shotgun in a squad car 
for over an hour — going back 
every ten minutes to revive Harri- 
man’s body — before anything 
happened. Then another car caught 
a squawk to go check on somebody 
who was evidently firing a large- 
caliber weapon in a quarry outside 
town. Braxn transferred to that 
car 

It pulled up at the entrance to 
the quarry. 

“Just some hunter, shooting 
cans,” the other officer said. 
“We’ll give him a warning and let 
him go.” 

Just then Doyle stepped around 
a corner, holding the piece of 
cardboard he had used as a target, 
elephant gun cradled in the crook 
of his elbow. He saw the two law- 
men and jumped. 

“Say, fellow, there’s — ” The cop 



saw Doyle bring up the muzzle of 
the weapon and barely had time to 
get his .357 clear of the holster 
when the first round struck him in 
the throat and severed his head 
from his body. Braxn made no 
effort to shoot. He was gathering 
himself to leap into Doyle’s body 
when a bullet smashed into his 
kneecap, spinning him around. 
Miraculously he stayed on his feet 
for a moment, but fell over when 
he tried to put some weight on his 
left leg. Half of it simply was no 
longer there. 

Doyle ran past as Braxn fell, 
Braxn pushing and pushing, but 
unable to free himself from the 
mutilated body. 

This is what Father meant, 
Braxn thought. He tried to teleport 
the shattered lower leg back to a 
conjunction with the bloody stump. 
It shuddered but wouldn’t move. 
If the creature Tm inhabiting is 
hurt badly enough and starts to die 
I can’t escape. 

His powers seemed worthless. 

What a small thing, he thought 
as the world washed away to a 
white glare, to die like this — to die 
a human. 

4< O AM — ” Braxn opened his 
O eyes to a white clean room 
and people all around him. He was 
in bed and what he first thought 
was a defect of vision was a plastic 
envelope that covered his head — an 
oxygen tent. 

“Sam, it’s very important —

listen.” The speaker was the only 
man in the room not in hospital 
gear. He wore a plain blue coverall 
and was obviously a policeman. 

“How much ” The man averted 
his face from Braxn. “How much 
longer. Doc?” he whispered to one 
of the other men. The doctor moved 
his head horizontally half an inch, 
then back again. 

“Sam, you’ve got to tell us who 
did this to you and Halliday. 
Please!” 

The doctor sighed and touched 
one of the nurses on the arm. She 
moved to Braxn’s side, placed a 
pneumatic injector next to his skin 
and fired. A powerful stimulant 
blasted into the dying body and 
Braxn surged almost reflexively 
into the body of the plainclothes 
policeman. 

He would have leaped on to 
Harriman, but another minute’s 
delay couldn’t make that much 
difference. He had revived men 
who had been dead for minutes — 
now the problem of reversing a 
case of terminal shock was just a 
finger exercise. He lingered long 
enough to adjust the body chemis- 
try of his former host — neutralizing 
the fatal stimulant dose in the 
bargain — made a few subtle 
changes in various organs, de- 
stroyed a cancer that was just 
starting in the left lung and went on 
to the White House. 

T he telephone was chiming 
furiously, but it took him al- 



most a minute to get Harriman’s 
body back into shape —it had been 
decomposing for a record thirty- 
five minutes. 

“Sorry, Fred. I was sound asleep. 
What’s up?” 

“Double shooting in Towson. 
The description of the weapon 
suggests Doyle must have done 
it.”' 

“Any witnesses?” 

“Yes and no. One of the victims 
is still alive — they might be able to 
gel a description from him. Luckily 
both men shot were policemen - 
when one of them drew his gun the 
act automatically dispatched a 
police helicopter — otherwise we 
wouldn’t even have this chance 
for a witness. That’s a terrible 
weapon he has.” 

“No match for the secret service 
and the CBl. Don’t get uptight, 
Fred.” Fred smiled at the archaic 
slang. “We’ll get him. I have every 
confidence.” 

Maybe that would be best, 
Braxn thought. Let them take care 
of it. I’m pretty safe in this body 
. best stay in it unless I get a 
direct tine to Doyle. 

Braxn’s man on the Ways and 
Means Committee had sent over a 
report outlining /important forth- 
coming bills. He started on that. 

(Harry drove his Hertz ground- 
car to Columbia and located the 
new Peace Corps school. He noted 
the position of the bleachers and 
drove on without stopping.)

“He look just like he

(Harry Doyle parked in the lot 
behind an all-night drug store and 
waited in the car until it got dark. 
Then he stepped inside briefly to 
purchase a small flashlight and a 
bottle of fingernail enamel. Out- 
side, he painted the lens of the 
flashlight with enamel, so it gave 
off a very faint red glow. 

(Harry sneaked across a golf 
course to a water tower he had 
seen that afternoon. It was the 
highest point around. He found a 
breach in the chain-link fence and 
wiggled through with rifle, hacksaw 
and lunch bag. 

(Using his light sparingly, Harry 
found the steps that spiraled up 
the side of the tower and he tip- 
toed up. A catwalk at the top ran 
all the way around the tank. From 
one point he could look down and 
see the faint pattern of light and 
darkness that was the new Peace 
Corps school and bleachers, not a 
half-mile away. 

(On the far side of the catwalk. 



on top of the tank, stood a small 
shed he had noted earlier. It was 
unlocked. Harry went in, closed the 
door behind him and lay down. So 
he had carried the hacksaw all the 
way up there for nothing. Who 
would have guessed he would be 
lucky enough just to walk in? 

<< T DON’T believe in luck, 
-i- Fred! There’s incompetence, 
carelessness, somewhere along the 
line.” 

“They’re doing all they can, sir. 
The director assigned another team 
— a hundred more — to the hunt.” 

“Maybe he’s laying low for a 
while — on the West Coast or in 
Canada — ” 

“We have men there — and there. 
And in Mexico and Cuba.” 

(When Harry awoke a bright 
line of sunlight shone under the 
door. He ate a stale sandwich and 
sipped water from a canteen.) 

“Almost time for you to go, sir.” 

“Thank you, Joyce.” Braxn 
heard the helicopter engines start-

(He heard footsteps long before 
the man reached the shed. When 
the door opened Harry was stand-

horizontally, butt-first, at eye level. 
The secret service man stepped in.

laser in one hand and flashlight 
in the other, and probably never 
felt the twenty-pound club strike 
his temple. 

(Harry considered taking the 
laser, but decided it wasn’t accurate 
enough at 800 meters. He heard 
the flutter of helicopters and 
crawled over the agent’s body and 
started around the catwalk.) 

Braxn looked through the win- 
dow and saw the green field, the 
school and the bleachers slowly 
rising to meet him. He mentally 
reviewed his opening comments, 
going over modifications he would 
make according to who had or had 
not shown up. 

(He crawled to his firing position 
just about the same time as the heli- 
copters touched down. He put a 
handful of ammunition in front of 
him — the rifle worked like a dou- 
ble-barrelled shotgun and had to be 
reloaded after every second shot — 
and focused the scope on the door 
of the white helicopter.) 

Braxn let two of the secret service 
men precede him, then he stepped 
out to the grass, Fred following. 

There’s the bastard! Breathe 
and hold, now . crosshairs 
on Harriman’s chest. 

Braxn jumped to the right 
No place to hide . 



. swing to the left — aim for 
the top of his head . not sure 
how far it'll drop but only has 
to hit his big toe and he’s 
dead. 

“You can die here,” Father 
said. Jump left. 

Swing right. 

Fred caught Braxn’s arm in 
a tight grip. “Sir? What’s — ’’ 

Now. 

Let go! “Let Go " 

The force of the bullet jerked 
Braxn from Fred’s, grip. His right 
shoulder erupted in a spray of 
blood and muscle and bone splint- 
ers. His body turned a half- 
sommersault in the air and he 
landed heavily just as the sound of 
the shot, rolling thunder, reached 
him. A second bullet dug a furrow 
inches from his head. 

Lasers crackled and filled the 
air with ozone while the doctor did 
something to stop the cephalic and 
brachial veins and the brachial 
artery from oozing and spurting 
blood. He was administering a 
quick injection for shock when the 
third bullet whined past his head. 
The fourth hit a secret service man 
in the abdomen, killing him. 

(Harry chambered two more 
shells and smiled. They might get

him sooner or later but, as he had 
figured, those lasers just wouldn’t 
reach. He put his eye to the scope 
and looked for a good target. 

(He failed to see the secret service 
agent who had jumped back into 
the helicopter and now poked out 
the snout of a 6.35 mm Mannlicher 
target rifle. Harry was squeezing 
the elephant gun’s trigger when the 
relatively small bullet from the 
agent’s rifle fortuitously struck 
the end of his telescopic sight. 
Glass shards and the metal eye- 
guard slammed back, painfully 
putting out Harry’s eye. 

(He stood up raging, blood 
streaming from his eye, and fired 
two wild, unaimed shots before the 
second small bullet opened a 
bloody rose in the middle of his 
chest. The bullet passed on through 
and penetrated the metal skin of 
the water tank, and a jet of water 
pushed Harry off the catwalk.) 



<< C ON! Wake up! This body is 
vJ dying.” The illusion of a 
friendly octopoid figure floated 
before Braxn’s eyes, not quite as 
real as the bright lights and anxious 
masked people hovering over him, 
green tunics smeared with blood. 

“It hurts. Father.” The surgeon 
didn’t look up, but one of his assis- 
tants turned bright eyes to the 
President’s face. 

“1 know you are probably in 
pain,” the prerecorded, hypnot- 
ically implanted image said. “Re- 



member your learnings and ignore 
the pain. You may be able to 
escape. 

“If you have learned enough 
about power — if you’ve learned 
enough from both ends of it — you 
have no further use for this body. 
Try to reach out and find another. 
Try!" 

Braxn tried but the pain was too 
much of a presence, a crushing 
weight. 

“This pain is not mine,” he said 
aloud. “This pain belongs to this 
body.” He took the thought and 
pulled it, stretched it until it lay over 
the dying organism like a shroud. 
The pain did not fade, but it slowly 
became less important. He reached 
out. 

The surgical mask was rather 
tight and tasted slightly of lipstick. 
Its owner had scrubbed down in too 
much of a hurry. Good to be in a 
healthy young woman’s body after 
that. 

“Scalpel,” the surgeon said. 

With hands that were his and 
not his Braxn placed a scalpel into 
the doctor’s waiting palm. 

The doctor stood for an instant, 
the scalpel in his hand, staring at 
the cardiac monitor. “Heart team,” 
he said and stepped back from the 
body. 

A medic stabbed Harriman in 
the chest with a huge hypodermic, 
pumping adrenalin straight into the 
heart muscle. He counted seconds 
under his breath, watching the 
monitor while a beefy medic pushed 



46 



GALAXY 




rhythmically on the sternum. 

Two men stepped to each side of 
Harriman’s body — both held long 
wands trailing thick cables. 

“Go.” The men slapped the long 
electrodes on opposite sides of the 
body’s chest, held him there for 
long seconds. The body jerked 
and twitched. A burned-flesh smell 
competed with the other odors, 
biological and medical. But no 
cardiac responses came. They 
repeated their efforts four times. 
Nothing happened. 

Braxn knew they would be able 
to do nothing. Not much anybody 
could do in a case of death by 
spiritual abdication. 

The last member of the heart 
team stepped forward with a set of 
chromium bolt-cutters. 



“Crack the chest?” 

“I don’t think so.” The doctor 
in charge of the heart team looked 
to the surgeon for verification. 

The surgeon stripped the gloves 
from his hands and pulled down 
his mask. With an opportunity to 
say something that would ring 
down through the ages, he merely 
shook his head, whispered an 
earthy monosyllable and stalked 
out. 



A fterward, washing up, 
L Braxn was still enough of a 
political animal to wonder whether 
that doddering old fool of a 
Speaker would have the grace and 
good sense to step out of the line 
of succession. ★

CHANGING 

WOMAN 



W. MACFARLANE 





SAN FRANCISCO (UFA) A 
spokesman for the UC Geophysi- 
cal Group said today; “An 8.4 
Richter with a Mercalli X-XI is 
not incompatible with observed 
effects, however localized. The 
San Andreas Fault goes out to sea 
at the mouth of Alder Creek, 85 
air miles to the south. The so-called 
‘Red Lady’ branch fault must be 
regarded as hypothetical, though 
stresses between the Pacific and 
Continental crustal plates. ." 

G irl cloud-walking 

said, “A job on the California 
coast?” She turned on her high 
stool and looked through the win- 
dow down the canyons of Chicago 
fading into quiet snow a couple of 
blocks away. She was a plump 
woman with small feet and long, 
blunt-fingered hands. Her hair 
was shining crow color and braided 
into a coronet. “They get a little 
hysterical out there.” 

“Birdeena Ora Oza Yadon, 
sweetie — ” Her boss was hesitant. 

“Are you using your forked or 
unforked tongue?” 

“Deena, from us you get six 
months leave of absence. From the 
Mundy Foundation you get double 
pay plus all expenses. That’s much 
wampum, my lady Indian friend. 
Work in big wigwam. You get 
food and lodging thrown in.” 
“Forked, I think. Maybe I’ll 
phone Rand McNally for a job. 
What do you get out of this?” 



“Nothing but trouble. You are 
the best collagist in the business, 
but Mrs. Arlis Mundy owns thirty- 
eight per cent of Aero Precision 
Survey. Who’s to replace you? Do 
you know how much that eighty- 
two mile Indiana State highway 
was out? Sixteen inches.” 

“So how did they measure it? 
With a string?” 

“They said laser triangulation.” 
“The benchmarks were painted 
fat and I have some reservations 
about that print-drying process. 
We’ve got to get deeper into the 
materials. I’m not sure the errors 
canceled. Now look, John—” 
“Don’t put me off, Birdeena.” 
She glanced around the room 
where she had worked for the past 
three years. It was familiar and 
comfortable to her — the tilted 
drawing board, the 4x12 table, 
the K&E tools, her desk with the 
calculator and phone and hideaway 
typewriter, the tall files and the 
ranks of flat files for air photos. 
This was a web of precision and 
rationality and beauty. This had 
been a safe and growing place. 

“Well, John?” There were spiders 
that cast a silk web into the air 
and drifted off with the wind. She 
smiled faintly at the idea of herself 
as a fat spider flying to California. 

“Hell with it,” he said suddenly. 
“Let the woman squeal. If she 
don’t like it bad enough, we’ll both

phone Rand McNally.” He had 
a wife and children in Oak Park, 
but he meant it. He was a tough- 
minded Syrian with an appreciation 
of his own worth. 

“Not to be hasty,” she said. 
“Maybe it’s time to go.” 

Girl Cloud- Walking never ques- 
tioned the provenience of decisions 
forming themselves from the sum 
of her life. She felt no need to jus- 
tify the quiet satisfaction of mathe- 
matics or her pleasure in the precise 
detail of engineering draftsman- 
ship. Her father had been a high- 
iron man and followed construction. 
She had had a year of college in 
Virginia and another in Nebraska. 
When she had had enough college 
she had found this job in Chicago. 

“Baby, you are so precisely my 
bag of tea 1 hate to see you go.” 
He was troubled. “You might not 
come back, Deena. You might like 
it out there.” 

“Might,” she said. "How can / 
tell until I go to Cairo or Cathay j 
Whether or not this blessed spot 
is blessed in every way? Old Indian 
saying by Emily Dickenson.” 
“Sure,” he said sadly. “1 mean, 
ugh.” 

F our days later Birdeena Ora 
Oza Yadon flew from O’ Hare 
to San Francisco International. 
She was met and made to feel a 
Very Important Person by the 



pilot of the Beech Queen Air, who 
flew her north along the coast and 
ducked under a rolling fog bank, 
to land south of Cape Mendocino 
on an abrupt airstrip carved in the 
timber of a valley behind the first 
ridge, paralleling the fog-blotted 
breakers. 

“What are you?” she asked the 
pilot. 

“Almost a foolish man, but not 
quite. Otherwise we’d have to land 
thirty miles away.” He grinned. 
“Blackfoot.” 

“Jicarilla Apache. My mother 
is Navaho. Friends or enemies?” 

“Brand-new,” he said and taxied 
the Queen Air to a hangar. “1 
don’t think we ever met histori- 
cally.” He ran to a door and she 
sat with her hands in her lap. She 
could not see the tops of the red- 
woods behind the hangar in the 
drizzling fog. The great doors 
opened from the center. He fas- 
tened a towbar to the nose wheel 
and hauled the plane into the 
brightly lighted building with a 
towmotor. It was an amazing 
place with great laminated beams 
and enough shop to build a scratch 
airplane. 

He carried her luggage to a four- 
wheel drive station wagon parked 
in front of a rubber-tire roller and 
beside a full-size motor grader. 
They drove outside into the rain 
and fog and he punched a code on 



50 



GALAXY 




a dash-mounted radio control. 
The doors of the hangar closed and 
the lights turned off. 

“Extra special, first class.” 
“Well, what do you do with all 
the money there is?” 

“Build a quarter-million-dollar 
hangar. Then you lay a twenty- 
four-foot asphalt road. That runs 
along the strip. That runs into a 
rain forest, that’s what.” 

“Right on. You can afford spec- 
tacular temper tantrums.” 

“The Mundy Foundation is a 
temper tantrum?” 

“It’s my latest theory.” 

“What do you do here?” 

“Oh, I’m airplane driver and 
head custodian — systems mainte- 
nance engineer. You’ll stay warm 
at the house because of the dam 
and generator, two thirty-thousand 
gallon propane tanks and fifty 
thousand gallons of diesel. We got 
backup systems on backup sys- 
tems. The last time 1 tried to 
figure, the investment in this hys- 
terical complex was two point eight 
million iron men.” 

“Because Mrs. Foundation is in 
a snit?” 

The station wagon shuddered as 
they left the forest and followed a 
cut through a ridge. The surf 
boomed somewhere in the fog. 
Rain lashed the windows. Scud 
creamed across the road in wavy 
lines. 



“This outfit has paid me more 
money in the last five years than 
I expect to see in the next ten.” He 
raised his voice against a drumbeat 
of rain. “I’m still going back to 
Montana and cowboy. Trouble is, 
1 know everything about this 
place — but what it’s about.” 

They drove into a wide paved 
area sheltered by rock walls and a 
roof. The asphalt was black with 
wind-driven rain. A door lifted in 
response to the radio control and 
they drove through a short tunnel 
to a garage. A dozen cars were 
parked herringbone around a 
glassed-in central office. A man 
stood by the door, laughing at 
another struggling into foul- 
weather gear. 

“Hey, Marty, the bridge farside 
screwed up again. Mesi Stevens is 
stuck over there.” He leaned 
against a red XKE Jaguar and 
pulled on his boot. 

“Damn it,” said the pilot. “We 
got to go underground with that 
line. Ed, this is Birdeena Yadon, 
new tech staff. Ed Fukahara, elec- 
tric genius and troubleshooter.” 
He introduced Birdeena to Doc 
Crowell in the glass office. He was 
a bony blond man with white snag- 
gle teeth who said he would have a 
key and ID card for her tomorrow 
morning. 

Birdeena followed the pilot to 
an elevator. “Who is Mesi Ste- 



CHANGING WOMAN 



51 




vens?” she asked. “Is this a league 
of nations?” 

“Mesi is our darkroom genius. 
All the people who work here are 
extra special. I’d like to know how 
much it cost to pick the permanent 
staff. They interviewed me three 
days before I skinned by. A fancy 
kind of selection and it sure 
works.” The door opened to a 
40x60 room, thick with carpet and 
interest. 

“What do they choose for?” 
asked Birdeena, looking up at him. 

“You tell me after supper,” he 
said and led her through chairs and 
planters and bookcases and tables 
to meet the housekeeper. Rose 
Chiappetta. She was at the far end 
of the room with her finger on a 
switch. Soft primrose-colored 
drapes marched across black, rain- 
running windows. She welcomed 
Birdeena and took her to her room. 
It was luxurious and comfortably 
snug. 

The people she met at dinner 
seemed curiously open to her, like 
moon-shot commentators revealed 
as perceptive men removed from 
the banalities of TV by the occasion 
and their own intelligence. Her new 
associates did not put on a front. 
They had sober self-esteem. They 
were courteous from strength and 
helpful and friendly. 

And something worth knowing 
was the pilot’s name. Martin San- 



derson . might just catch ... a 
plump little watermelon . out of 
the air — she smiled drowsily and 
resolved to continue her new nega- 
tive response to the deep-frosted 
chocolate cake Paul Maniatti, the 
cook, made. 

Girl Cloud-Walking went to 
sleep that night with a feeling of 
integrity and immediate security, 
like going up green in her mother’s 
old riddle. What goes up green and 
comes down red? 

She met Arlis Mundy next morn- 
ing in the drafting loft. 

ARLIS MUNDY looked like the 
X\. Queen of Hell. She was tall 
and regal in a vermilion knit dress 
and soft, cerise, ankle-high boots. 

“Birdeena Ora Oza Yadon, how 
nice you could come to work with 
us.” 

Birdeena was shy but not self- 
conscious. Arlis Mundy’s charm 
put her at ease, though she observed 
the nakedness of the hips under the 
knit dress and the faint, miniscule 
awkwardness with which this im- 
perial woman moved. It was an 
almost imperceptible flaunting of 
the Joints, a ghost of hesitancy that 
might be taut control or a conscious 
check of wracking forces. 

She took Birdeena through her 
austere office — orange and black 
and white — to a balcony overlook- 
ing an enormous cube of space. It 



52 



GALAXY 




took in one entire end of the build- 
ing, five stories tall. There were 
no windows. The temperature was 
controlled and the humidity con- 
stant. A series of composite air 
photos were racked one behind 
another, flown from the ceiling on 
overhead tracks. To the left was a 
montage of weather satellite shots 
of the entire Earth, sixteen by forty 
feet, in a clever Homolosine equal- 
area projection, an intricately cut 
orange peel spread flat. To the 
right was the coast of California 
from San Francisco to the Sierras 
and south to San Diego bay and 
the Mexican border. The photos 
were mounted on high density 
overlay with plywood web support 
trusses behind. Girl Cloud-Walking 
felt the hanging panels were deso- 
late, scuffed and pushed to discard. 

They walked down stairs to the 
lowest of the three balconies. “Our 
project is to create the most ac- 
curate photomontage possible,” 
said Mrs. Mundy. “The scale is 
one to three-sixteen-eight-oh-five or 
five miles to the inch.” She hesi- 
tated. “What is your secret name, 
dear? We’ll be working together for 
some months.” 

“Deena. My parents are not res- 
ervation. They called me Deena.” 

“Well then, Deena, reducing a 
curved surface to a plane has not 
proven altogether satisfactory. I’m 
told on good authority that a circle 



is a polygon with an infinite number 
of sides, so we shot along thirty- 
four degrees, twenty minutes from 
the New Mexico border west and 
laid the strip to the west as well. 
We reached the coast with errors 
obvious. What happened was not 
exactly what I had in mind.” 

Her hair was wheat gold, her 
face a triangle with a high wide 
brow. Her skin was white and 
smooth, her mouth small and crim- 
son above a pointed chin. “There’s 
no precedent for original research 
— obviously,” she said. “So we 
shall try another approach with 
control inherent. This is it.” 

In the center of the floor was a 
dome fifty feet across, rising not 
quite five feet at the center. The 
precisely patterned circumference 
was eight feet off the floor. 

“A representational slice of the 
Earth,” said Arlis Mundy. 

A carpeted platform projected 
from the lowest balcony. At the 
far end was a hip-high control 
standard. She stepped aboard and 
flicked a switch and checked a dial. 
She pushed a toggle. 

The platform ran out from the 
balcony on triangular steel columns 
with a hushed purr of motors and 
gearing. It was dead steady. She 
touched another control and the 
platform sank to within two inches 
of the dome surface. “You might 
call this a plotting chair or a layout 



CHANGING WOMAN 



53 




cradle. You’ll be working off it.” 
She flexed her knees. There was 
not the faintest quiver. She shook 
the control standard with both 
hands. No movement at all. She 
hiked her skirt and kicked a leg 
over the standard with a dancer’s 
improbable leap and lash and faced 
Birdeena. 

Her voice was level. "Similia 
similibus curantur." she said. “Like 
things are — let us say — cured by 
like. The principle is, like produces 
like and the part stands for the 
whole. This is where we map the 
United States as it has never been 
done before.” 

She touched the controls and the 
platform rose and carried her 
smoothly toward Birdeena, who 
stood stolidly on the balcony as 
the Empress of Hell in red loveli- 
ness rode the air to her. She won- 
dered why she had not seen the 
color of Arlis Mundy’s eyes before. 
They had no color. They were gray 
as fog. 

IRDEENA YADON worked 
twenty-two days straight be- 
fore Martin Sanderson lifted her 
chin with a curled forefinger and 
asked if she would like to go to 
San Francisco. “Avoid excess,” he 
said. “If the Great Spirit wanted 
you to work all the time he never 
would have invented Saturday and 
Sunday.” 



She blinked like a woman half 
out of a dream. “Oh, dear,” she 
said. “Mesi Stevens has Spring- 
field, Illinois to do again. He 
doesn’t know who slipped the scale 
but that’s what happened. 1 was 
checking along forty degrees north 
and found it.” 

“Then let him grope by himself 
in the darkroom. Moderation is a 
lovely virtue. Let’s go now.” 

She took a deep breath. “Yes, 
please.” 

It was a sparkling day as they 
taxied to the end of the strip for 
takeoff She admired the tall trees 
on either side and asked why 
shorter ones had been left beyond 
the end of the runway. He said the 
brush down to the rocky riverbed 
was for contingencies, the trees 
for emergency. 

“Life is very, very dangerous,” 
he said. “You should try to main- 
tain orderliness in areas not subject 
to control.” He ran up the engines. 
“The wingspan is fifty feet three 
inches and the trees are maybe 
twenty feet apart. We land at over 
eighty miles an hour. If the brakes 
fail or power quits on takeoff, I 
have those trees to go between. 
Ripping off wings is one way to 
stop.” 

They took off and banked over 
the ocean. The Mundy Foundation 
was an architect’s rendering on the 
shelf above the tumbling cliffs.

GALAXY 




The maproom at the far end was 
blind. Girl Cloud-Walking tight- 
ened her seatbelt and asked, “What 
degree of latitude is Los Angeles?” 

“About thirty-four, maybe a 
little north. Why?” 

“Earthquakes.” 

“We can do anything here just as 
good as they can in LA,” he said, 
“but don’t worry about our little 
home. It’s steel frame with ply- 
wood in sheer panels. The rock on 
the outside is for pretty. It’s a non- 
structural facade with lots of rebar 
in it. You might tip over the 
Mundy Foundation, but it won’t 
collapse. How do you like your 
job by now?” 

“Cartographer’s heaven.” She 
said there was not a trace of ex- 
pediency — unlike the experience of 
the old man of Thermopylae, every- 
thing here was done properly — 
though she felt like the top of an 
iceberg. An enormous amount of 
work had been done before she 
arrived and she was in the sunshine, 
sparkling. “I walk past all those 
empty tables and the dark com- 
munications center and 1 work 
in the drafting loft with only Nancy 
Kaneshige to help and we rattle 
around.” 

“Deena, I asked how you like 
it.” 

“Yes.” She, turned to face him 
in the high, thin sunshine. “Did you 
ever hunker down to look at the 



iridescent colors of oil on water? 
Ever surprise a skunk when the 
sun was low and the high fan of a 
tail was haloed black and white 
and gold? Were you ever really 
greedy with a box of your mother’s 
chocolates?” 

“Sounds like you have mixed 
emotions.” 

“I get a very Indian feeling out 
of this, those thousands of color 
photographs, the file systems, the 
loft, the layout tables, the arched 
assembly sections. It makes amaz- 
ing good sense — until you wonder 
why.” She said shyly, “I thought 
you were going to Montana and 
cowboy.” 

“I thought I might stick around 
for a while. Up by the border it 
gets mighty pretty by June — a very 
good month.” 

They separated in San Francisco 
and met for a late lunch at the 
Mark Hopkins. She thought the 
Top of the Mark very grand. It 
justified the chrysanthemum rust 
dress she bought a size smaller than 
her old size at the Emporium. She 
sat quietly by a window overlook- 
ing the world. She was deeply 
pleased with Marty Sanderson, 
hawk-elegant in her' eyes. How 
well did she know him? She felt 
far better than she knew. 

“How much does this cost?” 
she whispered. 

“A couple of boxes of thirty- 



CHANGING WOMAN 



55 




ought-six cartridges,'’ he whispered 
back. “A case of ten-thirty oil.” 
His eyes twinkled. “A small 
wiener pig.” 

They flew up the coast in com- 
panionable silence and Deena only 
raised her eyebrows when they did 
not put down at the strip behind the 
Mundy Foundation. “Thought 
you might like to see Humboldt 
Bay and Eureka,” he said. “They 
massacred Indian women and 
children there a hundred-something 
years ago.” She could not read his 
face as they overflew the sawmills 
and the bar and the long bay. “Get 
lots of rain. Better see it while it’s 
clear.” They banked over Areata 
and flew south. “I’ve got an Indian 
feeling, too,” he said. “If you meet 
a bear by mistake, the best thing 
to do is nothing. If that doesn’t 
work, run away.” He did not look 
at her. “We’re mixed up with a 
crazy paleface, Deena. Maybe we 
should run away to Montana.” 
“Why the to-ing and fro-ing?” 
she asked carefully. “The best of 
both worlds is barely good enough 
for us — even if it takes maintaining 
order in an area not subject to 
control.” 

I N THE busy days that followed 
Birdeena took mental notes. 
She had not been so formal since 
college. What she wanted to re- 
member, she remembered. What 



she forgot, she forgot. The notes 
were mosaic pieces she turned 
slowly in her mind to see if they 
made a pattern. 

Marty Sanderson told her, “Mrs. 
Mundy leased six Constellations 
and flew in front of winter last 
year.” Connies made the best 
photographic platforms. They 
flew the contiguous United States 
in east-west strips during Sep- 
tember and October. 

Paul Maniatti said, “Come on 
and see some day, Deena. There 
are caves dug in this hill behind 
us. We could eat for three years 
before we opened one sack of corn 
or beans. It’s all refrigerated and 
the bulk stuff is CA sealed. Con- 
trolled Atmosphere, nitrogen or 
helium or something. How about a 
piece of cake?” 

Mesi Stevens confirmed her 
opinion of the air photos. “1 was 
with ESSA, the Coast and Geodetic 
for twelve years. They never put 
together a series like this. The 
planning took eighteen months. 
There were four men in the comm 
center with radio and direct tele- 
type to field stations. Result — 
brilliant negatives, good overlap, 
no cloud cover.” 

Doc Crowell said, “The draw- 
bridge works fine now. If you come 
back late at night just put your 
card in the slot and turn the key. 
It’s pretty fair security. Park the

roller and grader on the air strip 
and you need a chopper to get in. 
You can't land a boat at the bottom 
of the cliffs. On foot it’s a long 
old walk in tough old country. A 
very careful setup. There’s no such 
thing as complete security, but this 
comes close.” 

Nancy Kanashige said, “How did 
you guess? We are missing Cape 
Mendocino to Point Delgada. 
They’re not in the prints or the 
duplicate prints and Mesi doesn’t 
have the negatives. Do you suppose 
Mrs. Mundy has them?” Birdeena 
said not to bother yet. 

When Martin Sanderson asked 
her if she would like an ice cream 
soda at Garberville she said, “Yes 
indeed I would.” She leaned back 
comfortably on the car seat beside 
him as they drove over the bridge 
and through the woods to the 
rutted public road. 

“Have you concluded any con- 
clusions?” he asked. 

“Human nature is neither good 
nor evil,” she said. “What happens 
is what counts. You’d better take 
what people say literally. More 
often than not -they tell you true. 
Do you know Marty, I feel all 
high-school girlish going for a 
soda?” 

“That’s too much to untangle 
at once.” He pulled off where the 
road was wide. He put both hands 
on her shoulders and shook her 



gently. “Speak slowly in short 
words.” 

“Sure, Marty. Arlis Mundy 
doesn’t like the world. She wants 
to do something about it. She 
doesn’t like the United States most, 
because she knows it best. The 
why could be hubris and three un- 
satisfactory husbands. It’s sur- 
prising how much time you can 
waste with why when the house 
is burning down. Hubris is over- 
weening pride. And she is using the 
most advanced technology for old 
and dark purposes. Marty, I think 
I’ll have a strawberry soda — ” 

He popped a smacking kiss on 
her mouth to get her attention 
and succeeded beyond expectation. 
It was Girl Cloud-Walking, who 
caught her breath and murmured, 
“Besides, she does violence to the 
principle of duality — oh, my good- 
ness — men and women belong 
together and complement each 
other — ” She surfaced again 
flushed and rosy. “So when the 
first good maps were being made, 
things were horribly stirred up and 
they called it the Renaissance. And 
with the blank spaces filled in — 
will you leave a girl no secrets? — 
the First World War came along. 
And air photography we;nt on be- 
tween the wars and a little more 
was stolen — ” 

“What was stolen?” he asked in 
a muffled voice. 



CHANGING WOMAN

“The soul of the Earth.” 

“Oh, no.” 

“Yes. And things settled down 
again until satellites and radio 
photos and the air-caught film 
drops and especially those in 
color — when you come right down 
to it, do you think the people have 
souls whose pictures are most 
taken?” She had his attention on 
two levels and he slowly disengaged 
the action on one. “Presidents, 
ballplayers, movie people,” she 
went on a little breathlessly. “I’m 
not sure television counts unless 
it’s recorded — ” 

“Primitive superstition,” he 
snorted. “Soul stealing!” 

“Bad things happen. Did you 
hear about the airliner on the 
Kansas-Nebraska border? They 
blamed CAT. That means — ” 
“Clear Air Turbulence, I know.” 
“What you don’t know is it 
happened when the very first 
montage was done. I’m extending 
from an arbitrary center, forty 
degrees north, ninety-eight degrees 
west. Arlis Mundy was on the plat- 
form with me. There was a fly 
buzzing around. I don’t know how 
it got in. She caught the fly out 
of the air with a snatch of her hand. 
She is very quick. The plane did a 
cartwheel over Burr Oak, Kansas.” 
“I’m getting thirsty,” he said. 
“Marty, what are we going to 
do?” 



“The second thing that comes to 
mind is Garberville.” 

“You don’t believe me?” 

“What do you want me to do? 
I’ll do it.” 

“I want to get into Arlis Muncy’s 
office some day when you take 
her flying. I don’t think her flat 
maps correlated enough. I want 
a key. What 1 don’t want is to see 
the rest of the country as far out 
in left field as she is.” 

“Birdeena Ora Oza Yadon, 
Girl World Saver?” 

“It’s not because I asked for 
the job — it’s just because if 1 quit 
somebody else will put the map 
together. Honest and truly. I’m 
my-heart-is-in-my-throat afraid. 
Let’s go get that soda.” 

S O WHEN Mrs. Mundy flew to 
San Francisco three days later 
Deena found the negatives in an 
orange-colored file cabinet. She 
took them to Mesi Stevens who 
said he would be happy to blow 
them up for her, just for the change. 
She hid the prints in the middle of 
Texas and returned the negatives. 
When Mrs. Mundy was away 
again, she made collage with all 
her skill and precision.

If Birdeena was patient, Marty 
Sanderson was not. The earth- 
quake in the Midwest bothered 
him. He got Paul Maniatti to fix 
a picnic lunch and took Birdeena 
past the airstrip and up the road 
a mile beyond the dam. She was 
sparkling but he was troubled. 
They walked along the narrow lake 
and spread lunch above a pleasant 
cove. 

“It’s wicked superstition,” he 
said. 

“Have another piece of chicken.” 
“Deena, the earthquake’s only 
logical. There’s a banana-shaped 
belt running north-south from the 
middle of Oklahoma through 
Kansas into southeast Nebraska. 
Just because they had a Richter 
three point four at Oklahoma City 
doesn’t mean Arlis Mundy had 
anything to do with it.” 

“These home-cured olives are 
good.” 

“Nobody believes you can steal 
a soul by photography.” 

“Seen any pictures of Howard 
Hughes lately? Marty, there are 
more ham sandwiches.” 

“You are out of your Indian 
mind!” 

“Over you,” she said shyly. He 
groaned in exasperation. “Tell you 
what, Marty. Let me take a sneaky 
peek. That unfortunate woman 
is up all hours and I’ve noticed 
things happen in the morning. 



Before dawn is an awful time if 
you’ve been up all night, hating.” 

“I’ll make you a deal,” he said. 
“I’ll get the as-builts out of my 
files. We’ll both take a look and see 
what goes on. I don’t agree with 
you and I don’t like any part of 
this — ” 

“I’m glad you can come,” she 
said simply. “I’m scared.” 

The next morning he scratched 
on her door at 4:00 a.m. She was 
dressed in blue jeans and a black 
sweater. He had a roll of corrected 
blueprints in his hand. 

“Here you are,” he said, “but 
we caii’t go this morning. I got a 
call last night after you’d gone to 
bed. I’ve got to pick up a couple 
of Internal Revenue Service men 
along with the Foundation’s tax 
attorney. Eight o’clock in San 
Francisco. 1 want to run a check 
on the plane before I take off. 
Okay, Deena?” 

“Anything you want is all right 
with me.” He grinned at her 
broadly, kissed her soundly and 
went out softly. 

She studied the blueprints. She 
took her courage and her flash- 
light and went up stairs she had 
never seen before. She climbed a 
ladder to a black attic. There was 
a catwalk through a wilderness 
of rafters and insulation and steel 
trusses. Ducting ran like rectangu- 
lar snakes. Every forty feet she 



CHANGING WOMAN 



59 




came, to a solid partition with a 
door. Bundles of wires followed the 
catwalk on one side, conduit and 
pipes on the other. The place was 
cold and black and quiet. 

She opened a final door. Blocky, 
louvered sha|3es were droning. 
There was a hisk and whine of mov- 
ing air. Stacks for the heating and 
ventilation units ran through the 
roof. A relay clicked and her 
heart turned over when a motor 
stopped. Beyond the machinery 
was the enormous, unpartitioned 
and solid-decked attic of the map 
cube. The trusses and girders were 
heavier. She stepped carefully 
over electric motors and gearbox 
assemblies. They were the support 
system for the overhead tracks of 
the vertical maps. She walked a 
line of nailheads with the utmost 
caution to a drum of cable. 

She lifted a trapdoor. It was an 
inspection panel for the tracks. 
Then she lifted a two-foot square 
of ceiling module. She lay on her 
stomach. The view was puzzling. 
She moved away from the obstruc- 
tion of the tracks and saw the 
sliced-off portion of the Earth 
way and away below. 

It would accommodate the cen- 
tral section of the North American 
continent at the determined scale. 
In the very center were the color 
air photos of her montage. They 
took the shape of a webbed X with 



the corners filled in at Arlis 
Mundy’s direction. Birdeena had 
been precisely on the Geodetic 
Survey’s control points as they 
were plotted. It could be a hand- 
some job, she thought rather 
ruefully. 

Something moved on the blank 
world around the cross. It lurched 
with a horrible grace away from 
the mapped area, a preposterous 
shrunken midget, a child's drawing 
with a head and legs but no torso. 
The legs went front and back from 
her direct overhead view. The figure 
spun and leaped over the montage. 
It sank to the surface on the other 
side and stretched out with the 
head near the edge of the map. 

It was Arlis Mundy. She wore an 
ice-green leotard. She crossed 
her legs and sat in ferocious con- 
centration. Was she thinking hate 
at the world? Panic? Hysteria? 
She moved her head in a curious 
forward rocking motion. She was 
blowing gently over a corner of 
Missouri. 

Half an hour later Birdeena 
stood in her shower and asked 
herself a little shakily if she felt 
like God, looking down on Earth. 
She dressed again and went for an 
early breakfast. The radio that 
morning had a news filler about 
the Jet stream swinging south. 
Birdeena decided she was looking 
from Earth down into Hell.

W HEN Marty Sanderson 
flew in with the IRS men, 
Arlis Mundy took them to the 
map room. “The spherical surface 
is built with the octagonal sections 
in question ribbed for strength 
and precision assembly.” Each 
piece was turned to a thousandth’s 
tolerance by a profile-milling 
machine. Yes, it was expensive. 
And it rotates and that wasn’t 
cheap. The architectural engineers 
wrote the specs. Certainly other 
construction was considered, 
screeded casting plaster, a fiber- 
glass section from a concave 
form . 

“But the cost!” said an IRS 
man. 

“The government is concerned 
with expense?” She turned her 
head away and Birdeena saw her 
instant silent scream — all the 
muscles of her neck corded. She 
resumed control and turned back 
to the men. “The contract, the 
earnest money, the progress pay- 
ments, the receipted bills are 
filed in my office. My attorney 
will be with you. 1 won’t.” She 
left the room. 

Birdeena saw Marty at lunch. 
He said Arlis Mundy inspected 
I he Queen Air while he was out 
on the air strip, regrading and 
rolling a hollow. He told Birdeena 
he expected orders to bring an axe 
and fly east, so Arlis Mundy could 



chop down the Washington 
Monument. 

When Birdeena went back to 
work, laying out nylon fiber paper 
on which the collage was tissue- 
fixed in curvature by a special dry- 
mount press, she saw Arlis Mundy 
in the comm room, speaking into 
a microphone. 

Arlis Mundy turned off the radio 
and said to Deena, “I missed them 
on the ground. The invoices must 
go out today. Will you run this 
envelope over to the strip and give 
it to Marty Sanderson?” 

Doc Crowell said he would drive 
her. They arrived at the hangar 
just as the Queen Air appeared 
over the treetops with flaps down, 
sideslipped and landed. Halfway 
along the field a cloud of mist 
trailed behind the right wheel. 
The plane stumbled forward on the 
tricycle gear — and did not slow. 
Crowell spun dirt onto the runway. 
He said something about too fast 
to stop, too slow to take off and it 
would sure as hell flip if Marty 
tried to turn. Birdeena folded the 
envelope of invoices and put it 
into her purse. 

Sanderson chose to go between 
his trees but he could not mangae 
to hit dead even. The left wing 
tore off with a wrenching squall 
and leapfrogged through the brush 
into the rocky stream. The fuselage 
pivoted on the other wing. It

crumpled. The stub reached for the 
sky. The wreck slammed to the 
ground. Sanderson flung open the 
door and threw out two men. They 
got up and walked dazedly. He 
hung a third out of the cabin, 
dropped to the ground and slung 
him over his shoulder. They all 
staggered away and were in a 
stumbling run when the gasoline 
hissing on hot metal went whoomp 
and a billowing ball of flame rose 
higher than the tree. 

They tumbled into the wagon 
smelling of blood and singed hair 
and shock. At the hangar Crowell 
phoned the house and the U.S. 
Forest Service about the fire. 
Birdeena ripped a clean rag for 
Marty to hold on the jagged cut 
from temple to ear while she 
mopped his bloody face with a wet 
towel. 

He said, “Ruptured brake line. 
Switches off but it burned. Too 
bad. Give a pretty to see if it was 
cut and taped. Oh, well.” 

She said, “Press harder. And be 
more careful. The life you save 
is not entirely your own any more.” 

Arlis Mundy braked her XKE 
to a stop and said she would drive 
the men to the hospital. Crowell 
would direct the fire crew. She 
drove the wagon with two men in 
shock beside her. Marty was in 
the back, steadying the unconscious 
man. 



Birdeena mopped his blood from 
her dress. She watched a green 
pumper arrive and water down the 
wreck. She washed her face and 
hands. She got her purse and 
opened the envelope. It had in- 
voices in it, all from the files, a 
year and a half old. 

Dinner was quiet. Arlis Mundy 
came in and had a cup of coffee 
with the staff. She said one of the 
IRS men had a broken pelvis. The 
other was burned and the doctor 
suspected internal injuries. Her 
attorney had a dislocated shoulder 
and bruises and Marty Sanderson 
had twelve stitches in his head 
and was resting uneasily. He 
wanted to get out. She flicked her 
upper lip with a pointed tongue. 

G irl Cloud-Walking awoke 
at two that morning with a 
quiet heart. She dressed as she 
had the night before and climbed 
to the attic. She thought of Chang- 
ing Woman, a favorite figure 
among the Holy People of the 
Navahos. Changing Woman taught 
the People to control wind, light- 
ning and storms and how to keep all 
forces in harmony with each other. 
She developed ways of doing things 
that were partly practical and 
partly magical. Girl Cloud-Walk- 
ing removed the inspection panel 
and looked at the world below.

A naked figure was dancing there. 
All restraint was gone. It was a 
dance of indecent triumph. 

She put back the ceiling panel. 
She replaced the trapdoor, re- 
turned through the attics and down 
the ladder. She walked the silent 
corridors to the loft. She turned 
on all the lights. Without haste 
and without waste motion she 
took the montage Mesi Stevens 
had blown up for her and fixed it 
together. She laid it out on the 



curved surface and the edges were 
lifted. 

Of course, she thought practi- 
cally. One of the large tables was 
very slightly arched. It should 
approximate the scale almost 
precisely. It was a brilliant color 
montage with every detail in fine 
contrast. She could see the airstrip, 
the road and the house. She fixed 
it to the table and shoved it into 
proper orientation. She clenched 
her fist above her head and

caught her breath. She thumped 
the map softly. Nothing hap- 
pened. She bent and blew gently. 
Birdeena straightened to listen 
— no wind at all outside. She 
kicked off her shoes and climbed 
to the table top. She bent and 
blew fiercely this time. 

The door to the office slammed 
open. Hell’s own Queen stood there 
in a fiery orange wrapper. Her eyes 
were a mad gray fog. 

Of course. Girl Cloud-Walking 
understood. It was a matter of 
intent. In sorrow, in compassion, 
in absolute determination she 
brought her heel down on the 
Mendocino coast. 

The building rocked and 
shruddered. 

Changing Woman danced and 
the world reeled under her and 
the Empress of Hell screamed 
soundlessly and screamed again. 
She wheeled to her office, a shadow 
seeker from the light, and the desk 
charged down the rocking floor. 
The door slammed shut of itself 
and sprang open again. Changing 
Woman saw her through both 
open doors, standing on the bal- 
cony, then flying and flying — as 
Girl Cloud-Walking herself was 
flying from the table in the jolting, 
punching, rumbling earthquake. 
Mr. Richter would admire this 
one. 

Deena was not surprised to wake 



by firelight. The electricity had 
gone with Arlis Mundy. The world 
was askew but steady now. The 
fire was licking at the photo files. 
Fire had no malicious intent. A 
door pushed open with a crash. 
Marty Sanderson stood there 
looking like the Sun, husband to 
Changing Woman. 

Changing Woman dwelt in a 
wondrous house on western 
waters. She was ever young and 
ever radiant in beauty. But Marty 
had a lopsided bandage on his 
head and Girl Cloud-Walking said 
“Aie!” when he picked her up. 

And she was content as he 
carried her through the shambles 
of the building, Birdeena Ora Oza 
Yadon, a safe little watermelon 
as the fire crackled and grew and 
roared behind them.

during an earthquake is sufficient

to put any comparative numerical 
value on a force that shifts ‘solid’ 
earth twenty feet vertically.” He 
deplored hysteria and rumors 
that “exotic machinery” found 
in the ashes of the Mundy Founda-

with the tragedy that took the life 
of a great and generous woman .

<< '^^HAT do you call yourself, 
then — a magnetologist?” 

“There’s no such word. Magne- 
tometerologisl would be closer, but 
there aren’t any of those either. At 
least not in the dictionary.’’ 

This conversation occurred be- 
tween David Groves and Gregory 
Ohno. Actually Groves was a 
geophysicist and his particular 
interest was magnetism. Magnetic 
fields of the Earth, their secular 
variations, things like that. In this 
case — the magnetic field or fields 
of the moon. 

“Just about here. I’d say.” 
Groves stopped the buggy. 

This was Pegasus 4, and the men 
were in the center of a small 
unnamed crater near Leontievski. 
Unnamed, that is, until Groves 
decided to call it Peacock. The 
name had stuck. This was Pegasus 
4, yes, and honest-to-God scientists 
were beginning to join the astros on 
the moon. Happy days for science 
—if you can forget Pegasus 2. It 
almost seems as if the Space Pro- 
gram were trying to make amends 
for that one. Groves and Ohno were 
both scientists and there was only 
one astro on this mission. He was 
Felton Ford and he was in orbit, 
minding the command module, 
Vireo. And all the astros and the 
scientists had had a bit of psychi- 
atric screening since the splash- 
down of what was left of Pegasus 2. 



For reasons of economy the 
scientists were semi-astros. Either 
Groves or Ohno could pilot the 
lunar module to rendezvous with 
Vireo — but they were scientists 
first and astros second. With Ford 
it was the other way around. 

“Houston?” Groves said. 

“Roger, Dave. Your seminar is 
coming in loud and clear.” They 
had been talking for some time 
about nomenclature in different 
areas of science. 

“Dullsville.” That was Ford, 
from orbit. 

“Okay, Houston. You have our 
position?” 

“Roger. Suggest you initiate 
magnetometry program now.” 

“That’s why I called, Harry. 
We’re beginning now.” Groves 
walked back to the nonmagnetic 
cart, switched on the magnetometer, 
checked the calibrations. The indi- 
cators showed nothing of interest, 
which was no surprise, but the pens 
were recording properly, tracing the 
first magnetographs made by a 
magnetometer moving directly 
over the lunar surface. Groves 
checked the odometer, took a 
tentative bearing on a distant mini- 
crater and started the buggy. 

“I don’t get it, Dave. The moon 
doesn’t have a magnetic field worth 
mentioning. Right?” 

“Depends what you mean by 
worth mentioning. I told Leeds we 



FRUE SCHOOL OF MODESTY

should have more interdisciplinary 
briefing. I don’t know any more 
about geology than you do about 
physics. As it happens, old buddy, a 
magnetometer emplaced by Apollo 
Twelve found a steady subsurface 
magnetic field in Oceanus Pro- 
cellarum. This field was localized, 
not global.” 

Through his bubble Ohno darted 
a glance of interest. “A magne- 
tized meteorite?” The look of 
interest was followed by one of 
outrage. “Why wasn’t I told about 
that? They filled us full enough of 
the magnetic constituents of all the 
Apollo samples. That’s another one 
the training program blew.” 

“Yes, alas. The Apollo Twelve 
anomaly is really more up your 
alley than mine. I guess you didn’t 
keep up with your outside reading. 
Or put it down to the complexity of 
the program. Or to the brevity of 
the briefing. Or to the time we spent 
learning to be quasi-astros. Any- 
way, that magnetic field in Oceanus 
Procellarum is almost certainly not 
caused by a buried magnetic 
jneteorite. Consensus is that it’s a 
magnetized chunk of native lunar 
material.” 

“I don’t believe it. Magnetized by 
what?” 

“That’s the question and you’re 
right to disbelieve. Just a minute — I 
want to see if this thing is working 
now that it’s in motion.” The mag- 



netometer was gimbaled and 
mounted with much sophistication. 
It had never malfunctioned in 
simulation, but that wasn’t always 
the last word. Groves stopped the 
buggy again, walked back to the 
cart and checked. “Houston?” 
“Roger, Dave.” 

“Magnetometer systems A- 
Okay. Random excursions of in- 
significant magnitude. Two gam- 
mas plus or minus small fractions. 
Will continue according to plan.” 
“Roger, Dave. Houston out.” 
Groves started the buggy. 
“Whatever it is, it could have been 
magnetized a long time ago by a 
close approach to Earth, of course. 
Within about three Earth radii 
would do it,” Groves said. 

“If that’ s so, then there should be 
other — ” Thoughtful pause. “Oh. 1 
get it.” 

“Right. That’s one of the reasons 
we’re dragging this device in a neat 
triangular pattern across the center 
of Peacock.” 

“Why can’t the thing in Pro- 
cellarum be a magnetized artifact?” 
“Don’t think they didn’t think of 
that, old buddy. But the field 
gradient was too low even to be 
measured — and there was no field 
change when Intrepid went back up 
to Yankee Clipper. There would 
have been if that field were due to 
an artifact. The reasons are 
complex.”

“So. No Sentinel ?” 

“Not there, anyway.” 

Groves glanced at the odometer, 
continued forward a half kilometer 
and stopped the buggy. “Okay, 
Greg. Station A. Do your thing.” 

T he moon soil was dark and 
crunchy, flat and even, sprin- 
kled with rocks that were quite 
small, nothing larger than an 
orange. Groves checked the magne- 
tograph. The squiggles were insig- 
nificant. Then he took a collecting 
bag and did what he was supposed 
to do to help Ohno. Looking for 
rocks of any size that showed 
striation, he began circumnavi- 
gating the buggy and cart at a 
distance of about thirty meters. 
Ohno took many photographs of 
rock and soil and, using selective 
criteria, collected several rocks. 

Station A mission accomplished. 
“Nothing striated,” Grove said. 

“Me neither. 1 didn’t think we’d 
find any. But we have to look — for 
the terrestrial tektite boys.” 
“Tektites aren’t striated.” 

“Well, Dave, you’re right about 
needing more cross-talk between 
the disciplines. Tektites aren’t 
striated and we don’t look for 
tektites on the moon, but we look, 
wherever we go on the moon, for 
striated rock. That’s related, and 
again too complex to go into. Let’s 
get going.” 



Groves started the buggy, made a 
120° turn to the right, and they 
began the second leg of the 
expedition. 

“Magnetometer okay?” Groves 
nodded. “Why aren’t your data 
being telemetered?” 

“I’d bloody well like to know that 
myself. 1 tried to find out but got a 
typical runaround. Some project 
engineer probably didn’t bother to 
compare the weight of the poly- 
graph we’re carrying around with 
that of the hardware needed to 
transmit the data back. Who 
knows?” 

Silence for a time. Then: “I’ve 
been thinking,” Ohno said. They 
were riding the buggy. 

“Mercy!” 

“No, really. Why does our noble 
mission put down so close to that 
Russian lem? We must be within a 
mile of it right now.” 

“They told us all about that.” 
“Yes. 1 know what they told us.” 
Houston was hearing all this — not 
that it made any difference. “They 
told us the geologists wanted rocks 
from very near that place, but not 
from right on top of it.” 

“So what’s your problem?” 
“Well, this is really my question: 
since we’re so close — why haven’t 
we been programed to go over 
and have a look at it?” 

“Damned if I know,” Groves 
said. “Houston?” 



TRUE SCHOOL OF MODESTY

“Roger.” 

“Being as how we’re so close to 
that Russkie lem, why don’t we go 
over and have a look at it?” 

“We went into that in your brief- 
ing. No scientific value. Senti- 
mental, maybe, but not scientific. 
What you’re doing is more 
important. All right?” 

“Just curious,” Ohno said, as 
they continued to Station B. Ohno 
from time to time saw a promising 
piece of moon and asked to stop 
the buggy. Groves looked up at 
Earth now and then. Glamor and 
excitement on the moon, right? 
Magnetometer working well, film 
being exposed, collecting bags 
filling. Turning 120° and on to 
Station C, which is back where this 
trip started. Why are the Stations 
designated so? Ask someone back 
on Earth. 

“That’s it,” Groves said, stop- 
ping the buggy. “I’ll check the 
magnetometer and we’ll go back to 
base. Not much time left.” He 
crunched over the dark soil and 
scanned the polygraph. He stood 
there looking at it. He shook his 
head and sunlight danced on his 
bubble. 

“Let’s go,” Ohno said, a touch of 
irritation in his tone. 

“Come here a minute, Greg.” 
Groves had unrolled, clum- 
sily, a three-foot section of the 
magnetograph. 



“How’s General Motors?” asked 
Ohno. He had an interest in the 
market. He looked at the lines. He 
didn’t have to be a magnetologist 
to get the picture. 

“Oh, wow — ” 

“Yeah. Oh, wow.” 

“Dave?” Houston. 

“Roger, Harry. Mission control 
from Redbird. Gentlemen. Approx 
halfway between Stations B and C 
we have hooked a fish. Not a very 
big one, but we’ve got something on 
the hook.” 

There was lots of conversation 
after that — and that was how we 
found Magnetic Anomaly 2. 

Graves and Ohno had to return 
to their module then and the boys 
in the back room at Houston spent 
the next eight hours in hectic 
revision of the rest of the Program 
of Pegasus 4. 

R eplanning the mission was 

. hectic because Pegasus 4 had 
just about run out of time when the 
anomaly was found. After com- 
pletion of the triangular explora- 
tion Groves and Ohno were sup- 
posed to spend six hours in the 
module, eating, sleeping and resting. 
During the first four hours after 
that they were to set up a battery of 
instruments, including a seismo- 
meter, two reflectors to bounce 
back laser beams sent from Earth, 
a few other oddments and a top- 



70 



GALAXY 




secret black box with an on-off 
switch on one side of it and an 
adjustable antenna sticking out of 
its top. After that they had two 
hours to prepare for liftoff and 
docking with the command module, 
Vireo. 

The six hours of sleeping and 
eating were necessary and went 
according to plan, though Groves 
didn’t sleep much. All other 
activities, however, except for 
planting the black box, were 
scrubbed by the boys in the back 
room, a decision which caused 
understandable anguish among the 
scientists whose experiments were 
thereby canceled. The command 
decision was that Groves and Ohno, 
once the black box was taken care 
of, would spend the remaining 
available time collecting all the 
data they could with respect to 
Anomaly 2. 

^i'VWTHAT’s in this misbe- 
W gotten box, anyway?” 
Ohno was impatient again and they 
were having trouble with the 
antenna. 

“That seems to be classified. 
How now, Houston?” 

“Back a trifle the way you just 
came from.” Groves made awk- 
ward movements and swore. “Hold 
it. Now just a little toward the 
horizon. Easy. Little more. Now 
back one micron. That’s it.” 



“Roger. And that’s at least a 
half-hour lost to magnetomelry. 
Let the record show that the means 
provided to adjust this antenna are 
ill-suited to the purpose. With your 
permission we’ll now proceed on 
our business. We don’t have too 
much time;” 

“No need to get sore, Dave. That 
box is important.” 

“What’s in it? Put on the scram- 
bler and tell us.” 

“1 don’t know, cross my heart, 1 
really don’t.” 

Ohno was firing up the buggy. 
This time he would be driving. 
Groves got aboard and they re- 
traced their previous path between 
Stations C and B. About a third of 
the way to B Groves said, “Okay,” 
and Ohno stopped the buggy. 
Groves got off and checked the 
magnetograph. 

“Okay. Slow ahead.” Groves 
walked beside the cart, watching 
the squiggly lines. How come I’m 
more tense now than I was at 
liftoff? Crunching over the dark 
soil. One of the pens began a wider 
excursion. “Here it ^ comes. 
Slower.” He thought of the last 
seismograph he had seen, though 
the curves were not similar. 

Maximum. “Keep going.” The 
excursions diminished. “Okay. 
Turn around.” Back to maximum. 
No need to mark the spot, the 
tracks would be there a long time. 



TRUE SCHOOL OF MODESTY 



71 




“All right, this way.” Groves 
indicated a path at right angles to 
B-C, in the direction toward the 
center of their triangle. Again the 
excursions diminished. “Around 
the other way and straight ahead. 
Houston?” 

“Roger, Dave.” 

“How come this isn’t 
telemetered?” 

“Payload considerations, 1 
think.” 

“Okay.” They crossed B-C and 
the pens began to go off the chart. 
“Hold it one.” Ohno stopped the 
buggy and Groves adjusted the 
range of the magnetometer. “Go 
ahead.” There was some backing 
and filling and Houston kept 
telling them how much time they 
had left. Groves had to switch to 
another range before they sat 
directly over maximum field. 

“This is it, Houston. Would you 
believe one hundred and seventy- 
five gammas?” 

“The field gradient. Groves, the 
field gradient?” A different voice. 

“Hello, Edmund. I thought you 
might be there. It will take some 
figuring, but it sure the hell is there. 
Not like Apollo Twelve, don’t 
worry.” 

Edmund didn’t ask if Groves 
thought they might have an arti- 
fact, but that was what was on his 
mind, and Groves knew it. 

“Can’t tell how deep it is yet,” 



Groves said. “Be nice if we had a 
shovel or corer or something. Pity 
somebody didn’t think to send one 
along. Well, we’ll have lots of data 
to play with when we get back, 
Edmund.” 

“That’s right. Don’t get lost on 
the way, friend.” 

Capcom came on. “You have 
thirty-four minutes before begin- 
ning return to module. Suggest 
you — ” 

“1 know, 1 know. We’ll get back 
to work now.” 

They did so, collecting such data 
as they could in the lime they had. 

Pegasus 4 returned to Earth 
without, as they say, incident. 

Pegasus 5 was loo far along its 
own path to be diverted to Peacock. 

P iEGASUS 6 was, after contro- 
versy, diverted to Peacock for 
the more or less express purpose of 
studying Magnetic Anomaly 2, or 
MA-2 as everyone came to call it. 
It was not an easy diversion, since 
the scientists involved in the 
original Pegasus 6 program 
screamed like wounded eagles, but 
in the end it was not the scientists 
who carried the day. It was the 
romanticists. 

Romanticists? Yes. The Pegasus 
4 magnetographs were studied 



72 



GALAXY 




relentlessly by anyone who could 
claim even a peripheral interest and 
the consensus was that there was a 
possibility that the magnetic field 
was created by an artifact located 
approximately two to four feet 
beneath the lunar surface at the 
pinpointed site in the center of 
Peacock. Pegasus 6 wasn’t going up 
there to gather rocks (though there 
would, of course, be some of that) 
or to make seismological experi- 
ments or to do anything much but 
find out, if they could, what MA-2 
was. So, because of the possibility 
of an artifact the romanticists won. 

Gregory Ohno did what he could 
to have a visit to the Russian lem 
included in the Pegasus 6 mission, 
but lop brass said that was a no-no, 
a zero priority. If the Russians 
wanted a look at that lem they 
could send up their own mission. 
And everyone knew they weren't 
going to the moon much these 
days. 

David Groves accepted with ill 
grace the fact that there was no 
way he could make the roster for 
Pegasus 6. His pleas had gone all 
the way to the top. No way. Slots 
in the Space Program must, in all 
equity, be passed around, must 
they not? But I discovered ... No 
way. In any case, Pegasus 6 
wouldn’t have much to do with 
magnetometers. More like 
archeology. 



“Needless to say. I’m more than 
a little pissed off.” 

“It isn’t as if MA-2 is your 
personal property, Dave.” 

“I know that. But that is the way 
1 feel, damn it.” 

Groves and Ian Scanlan, another 
geophysicist, were having drinks in 
a bar not far from the Space 
Center. “So what do you think it 
is?” Scanlan asked. 

“Consider the possibilities. There 
aren’t too many, after all.” 

“Right. There may be an artifact 
up there. If so, it comes from the 
solar system or from outside. If 
from our system, it’s from Earth, 
the moon or other planet or 
satellite. If not, it’s from outside. 
That exhausts the possibilities.” 
“That’s right, old buddy. A 
simple-minded statement that 
doesn’t say very much, but it takes 
care of the geography. How about 
trying for the why?” 

Scanlan ordered another round. 
He said, “I can give you one right 
off the lop of my frizzled head.” 
“Go.” 

“From outer space comes a 
spaceship and something goes 
wrong — if it can, it will, remember 
— and it whops into what is now, 
thanks to you, called Peacock. Why 
did you name it that, by the way?” 
“That’s a long story. I’ll tell you 
another time.” 

“Okay. So, this ship whops into 



TRUE SCHOOL OF MODESTY 



73 




Peacock — there being no Peacock 
there before, this crater being 
caused, built, created by the crash 
of a derailed spaceship into that 
place. So the artifact is the ship 
that fell there, making the crater 
within whith we have found an 
artifactual magnetic anomaly.” 
“You all right?” asked Groves. 
“You talk funny.” 

“I’m as all right as you.” 

Groves found nothing to say to 
that. “Right on, old buddy. But the 
anomaly isn’t big enough, not by 
orders of magnitude, to be a ship. 
So give me some more.” 

“Glad to oblige. So it could be a 
Sentinel like. You know? Some 
communication left behind by folks 
so superior to us we have to bend 
down to crawl under a worm, 
right?” 

“What?” 

“Superior beings, man.” Scanlan 
whirled his glass around, looked at 
it as if wondering what it was trying 
to tell him. “Trouble with you is, 
you got no soul.” 

G roves took offense to this 
and ordered another round, 
though ihe glasses before them 
were not empty. “I’ve all the soul 
you have, and maybe a little bit 
more, though my skin be white. 
I’ve been there, right? Right. Tell 
me this, then, keeper of sacred 
secrets: assuming this is an intelli- 



gence-indicating artifact planted 
three feet beneath that dark lunar 
soil — and for the moment I’m 
willing to assume that — who put it 
there? What does it do? What is it 
going to say? To whom? Could be 
it’s a signaling device for the home 
folks. Their home folks.” 
“Something is telling me it’s 
time to go home,” Scanlan said, 
but he didn’t seem about to go. The 
bar was dark. The walls were of 
phony soot-stained wood and it was 
a comfortable place. 

“It’s not time to go home yet,” 
Groves said. “Though home does 
have advantages at times. Assume 
again, then, that it’s an intelli- 
gently planted artifact. What is its 
purpose? Why is it there?” 

They were both tired. Both were 
drinking a lot — the two of them 
sitting in an Earthbound, darkened 
bar near the Space Center and 
wishing they could go up next time. 
And knowing that was out for both 
of them, one having made it once, 
the other thinking now he never 
would. 

“Tell me this first, brother. Why 
is it underground?” 

“I have the answer to that one. 
It was emplaced a long time ago on 
the surface, dead-center in Peacock, 
but the general course of events has 
since buried it. Micrometeorites, 
dust — like that.” 

“That would make it out of sight 



74 






GALAXY 




back there, man. Back in time, I 
mean.” 

“That’s right, it would. Look. 
I’m serious about this. We’re as 
certain as can be that the anomaly 
isn’t a spaceship that crashed into 
Peacock. No way. So back to my 
question, which you evade. If it is 
an artifact — which is, after all, 
only a possibility — who put it there 
and why?” 

“Okay, friend,” Scanlan said. 
His dark gaze, thrust over the top 
of his tumbler and into the eyeballs 
of Groves, reminded its recipient of 
a saw-whet owl he’d raised a long 
time back. “Okay. So ask it from 
this end. We are a superior culture 
and we’re out there exploring the 
galaxy, spreading the gospel. Or 
maybe we’re involved in rapine and 
plunder, who knows? We find a 
planetary system with, say, Cro- 
Magnons living in caves. Or with 
Elizabethans, the equivalent there- 
of, doing their thing in the equiva- 
lent of London. Oh, to be in 
England, now that — ” 

“All right,” said Groves. “We’re 
a superior folk and we find a system 
in a primitive stage of development. 
Do we have a message for them? 
Suppose we go to the stars 
tomorrow. We want to tell them 
something? The primitives we 
find?” 

Scanlan ordered another round, 
mentioning to no one in particular 



that this round would be the last. 
He focused his owlish eyes upon the 
problem, as if to solve it by mere 
visual observation, it lying there on 
the table between them. “I think,” 
he said, after some moments, “that 
we do. We’re superior folk, right? 
So We give them something to help 
them make it.” 

“Okay. 1 hope that’s the way it 
is. Why do we put it on the moon, 
then, instead of on the planet?” 
“A question of timing,” Scanlan 
said. “That says it all.” 

Silence for some moments. 
“Pegasus Four was me,” Groves 
said. 

“What?” 

“I keep wondering what hap- 
pened to Stuart Stong and Nora 
Ivanovna when Harry Littlewood 
flew Pigeon back to Glaucous and 
left them there. Pegasus Two.” 
“They died, man. Bad scene. Not 
yours to worry about.” 

“We were pretty close to them on 
Peacock. We could have gone over 
and had a look.” 

“Wouldn’t have bought you 
nothing — and they, wouldn’t let you 
do it.” 

Their concern with and about 
MA-2, and Grove’s thought of the 
first two astronauts to be stranded 
on the moon, had taken them some 
distance from Earth and they 
wanted to stay out there a while. 
But guilt feelings are to be dealt

with and they handled their present 
ones by getting out of there and 
going home to their respective 
wives, both of whom were, by then, 
quite angry. 

P |EGASUS 6 consisted of a 
command module carrying four 
and a lem putting three of these 
onto the lunar surface. They 
touched down within a hundred 
feet of the selected site. One astro- 
scientist in the command module 
and three scientist-astros in the 
lem, which was called Poseidon. 
(The command module was 
Neptune. One of the romanticists 
was a deep-sea fisherman by avo- 
cation, and his nomenclature had 
prevailed.) Two of the scientists, 
Perkins Savage and Sato Sugi- 
yama, were archeologists. Their 
astro training had been hurried and 
minimal. They had been chosen for 
their skill in unearthing and un- 
covering ancient artifacts. The third 
scientist was Corbi Acampora. He 
had been born in Napoli and he was 
a real quasi-astro — he could fly 
Poseidon up to Neptune, which 
could in no way be said for either 
Sugiyama or Savage. 

The first archeological mission to 
the moon. 

“Those tracks are as fresh as if 
they were made yesterday,” Savage 
said. 

Acampora looked into Savage’s 



bowl with contempt. “You were 
expecting maybe they’d be washed 
out, rained away, perhaps demol- 
ished by meteorites?” 

Pegasus 6 didn’t have a proper 
buggy because they weren’t going 
to cover much territory, but it had a 
considerable payload of things to 
dig with. Shovels, picks, probes, 
corers, things like that, and a 
magnetometer. These were in a 
cart that had been so constructed 
that two men pulled and one 
pushed. Pegasus 6 would have been 
in trouble if they had missed the 
target by much, but there hadn’t 
been any worry about that. 

“No,” Savage said, pushing. 
“It’s just that they are so fresh. 
They might have been made a 
minute ago.” Crunching over that 
dark lunar soil. “How quick and 
fresh art thou — ” 

“May I politely ask what that is 
from?” Sugiyama asked. 

“Twelfth Night. If music be the 
food of love, play on. You know?” 
“1 am archeologist. A very 
sensitive one, granted, but still only 
archaeologist.” 

“I may say the same for myself. 
Anyway; O spirit of love! How 
quick and fresh art thou — ” 

“Oh, really? This is a lunar 
mission? Or looney?” Acampora, 
pulling. “Do you know how many 
squawk boxes are tuned into 
that- ” 



76 



GALAXY 




“I’m glad you reminded me,” 
Savage said as they approached the 
site. “The nature of this mission, 
Pegasus Six, is archeological. And 
this is it. We’re there, Houston. Or 
here, as you prefer.” 

“Roger. You’re there. Savage, 
from the official Houston point of 
view.” 

“Roger. Site appears as de- 
scribed and photographed by 
Pegasus Four. Program 
commencing.” 

Acampora began scrounging 
around with the inevitable rock 
bag. His functions were geologic 
and photographic. He was not a 
real geologist, just a rock collector. 
Savage and Sugiyama made a brief 
check with the magnetometer, an 
instrument neither had heard of 
until recently, and began a delicate 
probing of that dark soil. They 
found MA-2, by probe, within 
minutes. It was no more than 
thirty inches beneath the lunar 
surface. 

“We have contact, Houston,” 
Savage said. “We’ll begin to 
shovel.” Savage and Sugiyama 
marked off a two-by-six-foot area 
and began to excavate. 

“Real weird,” Sugiyama said. 
“Lightest dirt I’ve ever dug. And 
the most uncomfortable suit to do 
it in.” 

Twenty-eight inches down Sav- 
age said, “There she is.” 



Acampora came over to look and 
to photograph. Savage and Sugi- 
yama now scooped with great care, 
removing lunar soil from whatever 
it was. Silence. 

“Well?” Houston, unable to 
wait. 

“Just a minute,” Savage said. 
Scooping more soil off and brush- 
ing clear an area of about a square 
foot. 

“You appreciate the fact that 
we’re waiting,” Houston said, a 
touch of acid coming over the 
microwaves. 

“Yes. You probably won’t tike 
this. This is no artifact. Sorry 
about that.” 

“What—” 

“Where are the geologists, now 
that we need them? It’s, well, a 
rock. Looks like a meteor. 1 mean 
meteorite. I haven’t seen one in a 
long time.” 

“We’d like you to describe what 
you can now see of it.” The voice 
from Houston trailed behind it a 
wake of palpable disappointment. 

“We know you’re sorry,” 
Sugiyama said. “We wanted an 
artifact too. More than you did, no 
doubt. It looks like a piece of dusty 
gray iron more than anything else. 
Moon dirt on it. We can’t see much 
of it. Give us a little time and we’ll 
tell you more.” 

“The surface, what is the surface 
like?” 



TRUE SCHOOL OF MODESTY 



77 




“What?” 

“Pitted or smooth? Rough or 
regular? What is the surface like?” 

“Small pits,” Savage said. “If it 
is a meteorite it didn’t fall through 
much atmosphere. We’ll extend 
the trench.” 

Acampora seemed bored but he 
photographed, with competence, 
the continuing excavation. The men 
scooped away the moon dirt and 
brushed off the moon dust and 
found that the object of this very 
expensive mission was not — to 
archeologists — of much interest. 

Back to Poseidon then, to dine 
upon those NASA goodies, to 
sleep and perhaps to dream. And 
Savage dreamed. 

S AVAGE dreamed of a Russian 
woman and an American man, 
marooned on the moon by a mad- 
man. His dream has not been 
recorded anywhere, but this is 
what happened because of it: 
Suiting up in Poseidon, mikes 
off. 

“Sugi.” 

“Yes?” 

“Our mission is an archeological 
bust, right?” 

“Right.” 

“But there’s lots else to do. We 
set up the programs canceled from 
Pegasus Four, handily sent along 
with us in case the archeology 
didn’t work out. We’ve plenty to do 



to keep us busy after we’ve spent a 
few more hours on the damn mete- 
orite, if that’s what it is. But you 
and Acampora can take care of the 
rock for a while.” 

“What you have in mind, old 
buddy?” asked Acampora. 

“I’m going over the ridge of 
Peacock and have a look at the 
Russian lem.” 

“1 see why you want the mikes 
off,” Sugiyama said. “Houston 
won’t buy that — and you know it.” 
“No way they can stop me, is 
there? I’m going to go.” 

And he went. There was a 
monstrous barrage of flak, of 
course, but Savage was persuasive 
and eventually got Houston’s half- 
hearted approval. He would have 
gone anyway. 

<<npHIS is rough terrain. I’m 
X about a hundred yards from 
the top of the crater.” 

“Slow down,” said Houston. 
“Pulse and respiration are both 
way up there.” 

“Roger,” Savage said, but he 
continued to struggle to the crater’s 
edge. Turning around, he saw 
Sugiyama and Acampora, small 
figures, digging around the rock. 
He reached the top and was 
stunned by the suddenly open view. 
“1 do be dog,” he said. “You all 
should be up here. This is some 



78 



GALAXY 




kind of view. I’ll send you a picture 
postcard.” 

He carried a camera, of course. 
He took some photographs. 

“I see the lem. About a hundred 
yards slightly to my right, down a 
gentle slope from here. I’ll go on 
over.” 

“Roger,” said Houston. “Life 
support looks good. Take your 
time.” 

“Yeah, sure,” Savage said, be- 
ginning to walk toward the fallen 
spacecraft. “I have a weird feel- 
ing,” he said some time later. 
“Like Tm about to open Tut-ankh- 
amen’s tomb.” 

Finally, approaching the ship: 
“The hatch is open. Nobody home. 
Lots of tracks.” He took many 
pictures. He found the male 
Russian astronaut. “This man 
looks like he died yesterday,” he 
said. “Vacuum-packed, so to 
speak,” he said, adopting this tone 
in defense of the unexpected and 
disconcerting sense of awe that he 
felt. And where the hell, he 
wondered, did the other two go? 
So he followed the tracks and found 
them. 

“1 will be damned,” he finally 
said. Everyone started talking at 
once, and Savage shut off the in- 
coming audio. He stood there 
looking, thinking, and eventually 
taking some pictures. They were 
lying there, close together, fish-

bowls off. Savage, aided by his 
dream, put it all together. They had 
stayed in the lem until there’d been 
nothing left to breathe. Then they 
had suited up and come out here to 
sit on this small rise and look up at 
Earth. And a few minutes before 
there was nothing left to breathe in 
one of their suits (which one first? 
Savage wondered) they had both 
taken off the bowls and put their 
heads together for the last time. 
And they had died, right then. The 
way they’d fallen, fallen together, 
had an unplanned and uncontroll- 
able beauty and Savage was 
reminded of ancient sculpture. He 
stood there some more, then turned 
on the incoming audio. 

“Houston?” 

“Roger, Perk, and just where the 
hell have you been?” 

“To the true school of modesty,” 
he said and he told them about it.

G roves and Scanlan were in 
Mission Control. Command 
module Neptune was halfway 
between here and there. Groves had 
an urgency to get on the horn and 
finally made.it. 

“Savage?” 

“Roger. Groves?” 

“Yes. I want to ask you 
something.” 

“Right on.” 

“What did you mean when you 
said that about the true school of 
modesty?” 

“Well, I’m glad somebody asked 
me that. You named our little 
crater up there, did you not? 
Peacock, yes. When I first heard 
you something came back to me 
from English Lit and I looked up 
the works of one Thomas Love 
Peacock. Great man. You know the 
quotation, of course, old buddy?” 
“1 named the crater, didn’t I?” 
“No offense, thin-skin. Anyway 
— and you will appreciate this — 
that’s what it was like, that’s how 
they looked. You’ll see the pictures 
later. For the benefit of the un- 
initiate, what Mr. Peacock said was 
something like this: Ancient 

sculpture is the true school of 
modesty. Where they — he was 
referring here to the Greeks — 
where they had modesty, we have 
cant. There’s more and you can 
look it up, but it ends with: Where 



they had anything that exalts, 
delights, or adorns humanity, we 
have cant, cant, cant. It came to 
mind, sort of, up there.” 

“Roger. I dig. Thanks, Perk.” 
Scanlan interposed: “Take good 
care of those pictures on the way 
down, you hear, white boy?” 

“Will do, Ian. Wish you could 
have been here, too.” 

“Not room for all of us this 
trip.” He relinquished the micro- 
phone. “Let’s get out of here,” he 
said to Groves. 

And they did. 

T he bar was dimly lit and the 
walls were of phony soot- 
stained wood. They had been talk- 
ing quite a while. Scanlan’s dark 
gaze peered across the polished 
wood into David Groves. 

“So. We didn’t find a sentinel, we 
found no artifact. But we got a 
message anyway. Right?” 

“Right. I wish I’d been up 
there.” 

“So what else is new? You can 
see the pictures. Okay? We get the 
message. Savage sure as hell got it 
loud and clear. So who else will? 
Who, and in what places? How 
many, and where? Enough to make 
any difference?” 

“We’ll see,” Groves said, think- 
ing it was about time to go home. 
“We’ll see.” ^

THE 

YEARS 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 



T he old man paused when he 
came to the campus. The sea- 
son was fall. A raw wind was blow- 
ing out of the west. It rattled the 
dead leaves that hung in tatters 
from the branches of academic 
elms and maples. It wrinkled the 
dead grass and blew through the 
naked shrubbery. Soon snow would 
come and the year would die and 
the new year would bow in. 

The old man was trembling, but 
not because he was cold. The uni- 
versity buildings in the background 



81 



frightened him. He was terrified of 
the students strolling along the 
walk — the long-haired, sloppily 
attired young men, the long-haired 
girls in overalls and denims. But he 
forced himjelf to go on and he 
made his old eyes focus upon the 
faces of the girls. It had cost him 
his life’s savings to make the trip 
and he was determined not to go 
back empty-handed. 

None of the students seemed to 
notice him. It was as though he did 
not exist (in a way he didn’t, he 
supposed). Repeatedly he had to 
step off the walk to avoid colliding 
with them. But he was used to such 
indifference. The young of each 
generation were invariably arro- 
gant and self-centered. It was only 
natural that they should be. The 
world was their apple and they 
knew it. 

The old man began to lose some 
of his fear. The university buildings 
were far less formidable in appear- 
ance than memory had painted 
them. Memory was a poor painter 
at best. It overdrew, exaggerated. 
It added details that had never 
existed, left out others that had. 
And there was yet another consid- 
eration. You could never see some- 
thing the second time in quite the 
same way you saw it the first, 
because the part of you that inter- 
preted the initial impression was 
forever dead. 



The old man peered eagerly at 
the faces of the strolling girls, 
searching for Elizabeth’s. It was 
her face alone that he wanted to 
see. He wanted to take its youthful 
radiance back with him so that the 
final years of his life might be less 
bleak — so that some of the loneli- 
ness that had descended upon him 
after the death of his wife might be 
driven away. Just for a little while. 
A little while would be enough. 

When he finally found her face he 
was touched to his marrow. So 
young, he thought. So sweetly 
beautiful. It surprised him that he 
could recognize it so readily. Per- 
haps memory was not as poor a 
painter as he had thought. His 
heart pounded and his throat grew 
tight. The classic reactions, only 
in his case multiplied by one thou- 
sand. His vision dimmed. He found 
it hard to see. Elizabeth . 

She was walking beside a tall 
young man, talking to him and 
swinging her books. But the old 
man did not look at her companion. 
The moment was too precious to 
waste. Besides, he was afraid to 
look. The years . 

The couple grew closer, laughing 
and talking, warm and secure in 
the oasis of their youth. Elizabeth 
wore no hat, no kerchief. Her red- 
gold hair danced in the wind, broke 
in evanescent waves along the soft 
shores of her childlike cheeks.

Her lips were an autumn leaf lying 
lightly upon the lovely landscape 
of her face. Her eyes were shards 
of summer sky. She wore a shape- 
less gray sweater and paint-daubed 
dungarees. Her long and lissome 
legs were hidden from the sun. But 
memory served him well. 

He was crying now. Unabashedly, 
the way a drunk cries. Elizabeth. 
Elizabeth, my darling, my dear . 

She did not even notice him till 
she and her companion were almost 
abreast of him. Then she seemed 
to feel his gaze and looked into his 
eyes. She stopped and her face went 
white. Her companion halted be- 
side her. The old man halted, too. 

Color came into Elizabeth’s 
cheeks. Revulsion darkened the 
azure of her eyes. Her full lips 
thinned. “How dare you stare at 
me like that, you dirty old man!” 

Her companion was indignant. 
Angrily he confronted the old man. 
“1 ought to punch you in the nose!” 

The old man was horrified. Why, 
they hate me, he thought. They 
look upon me as a leper. 1 didn’t 
expect them to recognize me — I 
didn’t want them to. But this — 
dear God, no! 

He tried to speak, but there was 
nothing he could say. He stood 
there dumbly, staring at the 
young man’s strange and familiar 
face. 

“Dirty old man,” Elizabeth said 



again. She took her companion’s 
arm and the two of them walked 
away. Helplessly the old man 
stared after them, knowing that 
although he would go on living, 
from that moment on he would be 
dead. 

Why didn't I remember? he won- 
dered. How could I have forgotten 
that poor old man? 

He returned on dead legs to the 
bosquet on the outskirts of the 
university town where the time- 
field burned, stepped into its shim- 
mering embrace and sped back 
through the years that had trans- 
muted him from a tall young man 
into something unclean. After 
paying the guard the second half 
of the agreed-upon bribe and 
leaving the time station by the rear 
entrance, he drove out to the ceme- 
tery where Elizabeth lay buried. 
He stood by the grave, in the bitter 
wind, for a long time. Again and 
again he read the inscription on the 
granite marker: B. — d. in 
MEMORY OF MY BELOVED WIFE . 

But Time the Thief had not yet 
finished. It trephined his skull and 
cut keep into his memories and ex- 
tracted the soft summer nights and 
the sleeping flowers and the misty 
afternoons. It left only naked fields 
and tree-denuded hills. 

He read the inscription a final 
time. 

“Dirty old woman,” he said. ★

J AMES BUSH, prolific and 
sometimes extraordinary author 
{A Case of Conscience, the “Cities 
in Flight” novels), editor {Nebula 
Award Stories 5. Kalki — which is 
the journal of the James Branch 
Cabell Society) and, writing as 
“William Atheling, Jr.,” critic- 
in-depth, has given us Midsummer 
Century, a novel about ESP. 
That is about as descriptive a 
phrase as saying that the Forsyte 
Saga is a story about some people. 
When Blish begins to ponder 
something he does it with care and 
rigor and a great gift for hypo- 
thesis. He is an argumentative man 
and when he finds himself unable 
to go along with some line of 
thinking -J. B. Rhine’s, perhaps 
or Soal’s — he tries to demolish 
it. His hypothesis in this case is 
interesting indeed: that the evolu- 
tionary development of ESP and 
that of intelligence are mutually 
exclusive, mostly because intel- 
ligence does most of its chores 
better. To Blish, however, this 
does not mean that in the future 
ESP will necessarily evolve out or 
that intelligence will necessarily 
prevail — or even that ESP will 
disappear entirely from intelligent 
species. His deep and very wise 
insight into nature illuminates the 
fact that nature does not, need not, 
and probably will not proceed in a 
linear fashion to satisfy anyone's 



preconceptions. In Midsummer 
Century, the Birds (and believe me. 
they are a flock very different from 
Hitchcock’s Birds) have developed 
a form — or degree -of extrasen- 
sory, nonintelligent proclivity 
which seriously threatens hu- 
manity. But that is only one thread, 
one level of this unusual book. 
There are also a seriously con- 
sidered thesis on the nature of 
death and an afterlife, and one on 
possession or the coexistence of 
one or more entities within an- 
other. Yes, and something to do 
with flying, too, which is the basis 
for one of the more exciting pas- 
sages. During it the imprisoned 
protagonist kills one of his guards 
— a bird — and uses the corpse to 
glide himself out of the prison 
tower. Blish exhibits his usual 
flaw: he seems unable to put him- 
self in the presence of dialogue 
and personally hear it — if he did 
he wouldn’t write it as he does and 
his dialogue would be as good as 
his narrative, which is very. In 
any case, he most assuredly has 
an engrossing book here. Recom- 
mended.

Golden Hours by Ernest Brahmah, 
respectfully edited by Lin Carter. 
Kai Lung is a sort of Scheherezade/ 
Schweik/ Aesop/Munchausen from 
mythical-mystical China, who 
clumsies himself into one appalling 
predicament after another and 
gets out of each by telling stories 
— more often than not to someone 
who knows he has not made his 
point but who lets him go anyway 
because the story was such fun. 
Once you tune in to Brahmah’s 
Ching Lee type of periphrasis 
(“This humble and overrated per- 
son inexcusably suggests. .”) and 
begin to waltz with it — for if you 
can’t it will get in your way — 
you’ll be enchanted. 

D aw books is Donald A. 

Wollheim, editor become 
publisher, and he is presenting an 
interesting line. His guarantee 
(aside from his claim to like what 
science-fiction readers like — and 
he ought to; he started in the field, 
rumor has it, some time between 
Cyrano de Bergerac and Hugo 
Gernsback) is that he will not 
publish anything that has been in 
paperback before. This he does by 
reprinting hardcovers from a while 
back, by buying originals and by 
making up collections in a new 
blend. More power to him. Ex- 
amples in each category are 
these: 



My favorite for this month and 
probably for a good while to come: 
The Mind Behind the Eye, by 
Joseph Green, which was published 
in hardcover in England. Here is 
story-telling with a vengeance. 
I’m not claiming that Joseph 
Green is a National Book Award 
league writer, but he tells a rich 
and eventful tale with two strong 
pluses: one, he really makes you 
give a damn about his characters 
and, two, his is the newly liberated, 
no-taboo approach so sorely needed 
before the prudery was zapped. 
Here is really the best of both 
worlds. Too many writers seem to 
have the idea that demonstrating 
their liberation is all they have to 
do and do it instead of telling a 
whacking good yarn. Green brings 
in sex without a giggle or blush or 
brashness, and as an absolutely 
essential component to his nar- 
rative. And what a narrative — not 
since Robert Young has there been 
a writer who envisages the gigantic 
as awesomely and specifically as 
Green. I’ll give you this much: an 
alien invader is captured, not quite 
dead; his brain is irreparably 
damaged. He is three hundred feet 
tall. A space behind his eyeball 
is cleared away and fitted with 
two sets of computers, one for the 
autonomic system and one for the 
temporal chores, and two scien- 
tists, one a woman, get in there 



86 



GALAXY 




and make the giant live again — go 
to Mars — send out distress calls — 
be rescued by the interstellar 
aliens. I enjoyed this to the point 
of public gratitude to Mr. Green 
and DAW. 

An example of the originals 
DAW is publishing is Brian N. 
Ball’s The Probability Man. If 
you like convoluted plotting, 
worlds within worlds, time, space 
and history all recast into a con- 
cept of (to misquote the Bard) all 
the worlds are stages, then this is 
for you. For me, it’s interesting 
that a 300-foot giant overwhelms 
me with size and a time-space- 
and-planets thing just hits me as a 
passable passe-temp.s. But I’m 
speaking my crotchets and per- 
haps they’re not yours. 

Finally, DAW is doing things 
like The Book of Van Vogt, a nice 
retrospective, and the 1972 Annual 
World's Best SF, an activity 
Wollheim has been into for long 
enough to know well what he’s 



doing. I have always liked his selec- 
tions, though such a sweepingly 
inclusive title raises an eyebrow. 
It’s not really as arrogant as it 
seems — and nobody would de- 
mand an exactitude like "The Best 
1972 Science Fiction I Could Get." 
He got some pretty good ones. 

I’m not going to review the re- 
print of Ursula K. Le Gain’s 
Rocannon's World, beyond re- 
porting that it’s available and 
stating that this is one author you 
can buy on sight. 

R oger Elwood and Vic 
- Ghidalia have come up with 
a real treasure: Young Demons, 
the best anthology of stories about 
marvelous, terrifying, amazing 
and unforgettable children since 
William Tenn’s landmark Chil- 
dren of Wonder. There are eight 
stories, every single one worth 
the price of the whole book. 1

Bettyann in its original novelette 
form. The novel is excellent, too, 
but this one grabbed me when it 
first came out in 1951 and the 
advent of the novel made me a 
little sad: would I ever see the 
original again? Well, I did — and so 
can you. 

B usy, busy Arthur Clarke. 

Completists are always down 
at the lumberyard with their 
hammers and saws, building exten- 
sions for the Clarke shelf. Quantity 
does not impair the special quali- 
ties of this giant in our field. Re- 
port on Planet Three and Other 
Speculations is a collection of 
articles, speeches, hypotheses and, 
well, speculations reprinted from 
a wide variety of publications. 
He expounds on science, tech- 
nology, religion and Asimov, al- 
ways with clarity and a good deal 
of dry humor. The Wind from the 
Sun is a new collection of fiction, 
his sixth, and contains all the 
stories he wrote in the ’sixties, 
which he terms “one of the most 
dramatic periods in the history of 
science and technology.” It was 
indeed, and Clarke’s nineteen 
stories reflect it well. Well-written 
and well-priced, this is a book 
worth having. 

K it Pedlar and Gerry Davis 
are, yet again, authors who 



do far better with ideas than with 
people. Mutant 59: The Plastic 
Eaters is one of the most fascinat- 
ing compendia of real and extra- 
polated science and technology 
that I have ever read. Micro- 
biology, metallurgy, aero- and 
hydro-dynamics — and then first- 
order verisimilitude in the opera- 
tion and internal function of air- 
craft and contemporary spacecraft 
— all marvelous. The tight de- 
scriptions of the mysterious break- 
ups of machines are almost 
unbearably realistic and sus- 
penseful. It’s only when it gets 
into interpersonal relationships 
that one comes back out of the 
book — the one time one should go 
in deeper. I get angry about this — 
see above, the remarks about Blish 
— not because of the defects of an 
author but because of his merits. 
1 get angry when I see someone 
pounding in tacks with a violin, 
even when it isn’t my violin. I get 
many, many more books than I 
review, and flawed technique 
coupled with flawed ideation makes 
for titles I just don’t bother you 
with. When the extraordinary and/ 
or unique comes along, as it does 
in this book, with bathetic people 
in it — I, well, am bothered. Still, by 
all means read this — it has so 
much. But if that “much” doesn’t 
make you regret that there is not 
more. ★

THE SOUL MUSIC OF 
DUCKWORTH’S DIBS 

LARRY EISENBERG 




If you would make this a better 
world — just listen to yourself! 



D uckworth was bored, i 

could see it all in the lack- 
luster glimmer of his black, beady 
eyes. He yawned and stretched 
constantly and 1 found myself 
yawning in empathy, though 1 was 
bursting with vigor and vitality. 

“For God’s sake,” I snapped 
one day. “What’s wrong with 
you?” 



He sighed. 

“I’m in one of those doldrums 
that periodically afflict all scien- 
tific minds. At the moment I’m 
without a single new idea to pursue 
and the old ones are a total drag. 
Don’t worry. I’ll snap out of it.” 
But he didn’t. He seemed to 
mope about most of the time. 1 
was concerned enough to schedule 



89 



a lunch date at the faculty dining 
room with Dr. Nahr, eminent 
psychologist who had sent his 
rats through many maze patterns. 
I slipped the problem of Duck- 
worth’s boredom into the conver- 
sation slyly and Dr. Nahr bit. 

“1 know what he’s going 
through,” he said. “I’ve been 
there myself. My solution always 
is to construct a new sort of maze, 
one that the rats can’t possibly 
solve.” 

“Don’t you like rats?” 

“I hate ’em,” said Dr. Nahr. 
“I’ve always hated them since I 
was a boy. My guiding ambition 
is to drive the rats into a nervous 
breakdown through frustration.” 

“I don’t think that would help 
Duckworth,” I said doubtfully. 

“Alternatively,” said Dr. Nahr, 
“he might try to sweep his mind 
clean for a bit. He feels barren at 
the moment and struggles to 
come up with ideas. Consequently 
he ties himself into mental knots.” 
“Then you would suggest?” 
“Total disengagement from 
academic activity. Let him loaf, 
fish, even chase women if his 
fancy takes him.” 

“It might,” 1 said. “I’ll 
subtly try to suggest this carefree 
sabbatical.” 

1 tried to locate Duckworth that 
afternoon but without any luck. 
That evening I gulped my dinner 



and sat impatiently through a 
television spectacular on the 
evolution of a multiple ingredient 
sudsless soap until, in an unwary 
moment, my teenage daughter 
momentarily hung up the tele- 
phone. I snatched it and dialed 
vigorously. I hit the jackpot. The 
great Nobel laureate was at home. 

A bone-cracking yawn preceded 
his; “Hello.” 

“Duckworth,” I cried. “Where 
were you all afternoon?” 

“Sleeping.” 

1 clucked my tongue. 

“I think I have the cure for 
your problem.” 

He seemed unimpressed as 1 
outlined Dr. Nahr’s strategy. 
But at last he reluctantly agreed to 
try the approach, possibly just to 
get rid of me. 

E APPEARED to have taken 
my suggestion. The following 
morning and afternoon, when 1 
peeked into his lab, he was not 
around. His secretary assured me 
he was not sleeping at home. In a 
week’s time I had begun to wonder 
where he was. A week after that 
I had almost forgotten about him 
when I was called to the phone. 1 
was both guilty and pleased at 
the sound of Duckworth’s voice, 
annoyed and acerbic as ever when 
his brain was functioning.

“You’re back al work?” I 
cried. 

“Damn right,” he snapped. 
“Can you gel over to my lab 
right away?” 

1 was delighted to go. It was 
clear that the cobwebs had been 
swept away and that the superb 
creative machine, the Duckworth 
brain, was ready to start cracking 
again. He was pacing up and down 
when 1 arrived, muttering to 
himself in little expletives. 

“Something is wrong?” I asked 
anxiously. 

“Worse than that,” he said 
bitterly. “I tried to immerse my- 
self in wine, women and song. The 
wine was all right, but the 
women? We’ve lost all sense of 
true bawdiness and vulgarity. 

“You were turned down?” 

“On the contrary, I didn’t even 
have to ask. And have you seen a 
Tilm lately?” 

“Not many,” 1 admitted. 
“Frankly, I’m a bit embarrassed 
by the spate of explicit sexual acts 
that cram the screen. Besides, I’ve 
never looked on sex as a spectator 
sport.” 

Duckworth seized my hand and 
shook it warmly. 

“There are times,” he said, 
“when I remember why it is 
I’m so fond of you. But you left 
out the most salient feature. The 
films are all deadly dull.” 



“True.” 

“And,” resumed Duckworth, 
“although 1 had hoped to relax 
through a series of quietly banal 
films, these bits of rulomania 
overwhelmed the eyes and ears 
with grotesque caricatures of 
the female and male form. 
Frankly, I’ve had my fill of 
pimpled rumps.” 

1 shuddered at the image. 

“But there is still song," 1 said. 

“Which brings me to my newest 
idea,” said Duckworth. 

I beamed at him. 

“Don’t look so damned happy,” 
said Duckworth. “It’s a minor 
effort but it’s in the public interest. 
I’ve listened to enough rock 
epics to know when I’ve been had 
by incompetents and musical 
cretins. I wondered where the 
Mozarts and Beethovens had 
gone. And then the answer came to 
me.” 

“They’re dead?” 

“I’m trying to be serious,” said 
Duckworth. “I’ve invented a new 
musical form. It will require your 
considerable programing talents 
and the aid of your computer.” 

I was disappointed and I suppose 
my chagrin showed/ in my face. 

“There’s nothing original in 
that approach,” I said. “Computer 
programs have been written to 
compose music and there are 
electronic devices like the Moog 



THE SOUL MUSIC OF DUCKWORTH’S DIBS

that can simulate many 
instruments.” 

“I’m quite aware of all that,” 
said Duckworth. “My DIBS 
offers an approach that goes back 
to the human being in the most 
fundamental sense.” 

“DIBS?” 

“Duckworth’s Instrument Body 
Synthesizer.” 

“Are you synthesizing bodies?” 

Duckworth groaned. 

“So my acronym isn’t perfect. 
Listen to my idea. I propose to 
assign various tonal scales to 
certain body parameters. For 
example, the electrocardiogram is 
an elecrical waveform which 
reproduces the field changes due 
to the contraction cycle of the 
heart. Suppose I assign a different 
note to each level of this 
waveform?” 

“And assign another range of 
notes to the brain-wave pattern?” 
I suggested. 

Duckworth almost went into a 
highland fling. 

“You’ve got the idea,” he 
exulted. “Cellos for the blood 
pressure, oboes for skin re- 
sistance. By monitoring these 
different body parameters and 
sending our signals to the DIBS, 
we can produce the sounds of 
different instruments, each one 
corresponding to different changes 
in one’s body.” 



“It sounds exciting to me,” I 
said. “Each individual will 
produce his own music, unique 
to himself and to the mood he’s 
in. I like the idea.” 

“Good,” said Duckworth. “I 
need your time, lots of it.” 

1 didn’t have the time to spare 
but I couldn’t let my old friend 
down. 

“I’ll fit you in somehow,” I 
promised. 

I STOLE fleeting moments here 
and there. Even at the movies, 
1 thought of how certain subrou- 
tines ought to go. I skipped lunches 
for weeks until candy bars began to 
rot my teeth. And at last my 
computer program was written and 
debugged. 

Duckworth had been patience 
itself. He met me in the computer 
lab, pushing ahead of him a 
cabinet on wheels. 

“We’ll place the monitoring 
electrodes on your body, connect 
them to my box and thence to the 
computer,” he said. 

“My body?” I cried. “Not me.” 
“Don’t be afraid of exposing your 
soul,” said Duckworth. “I’ll have 
the output sound connected to 
your earphones and you alone shall 
hear the music.” 

I drew a deep breath as Duck- 
worth deftly applied the electrodes 



92 



GALAXY 




and then switched on his box. My 
music began. 

It was an exhilarating experience 
and a painful one — all at the same 
time. It revealed everything I knew 
about myself and things I didn’t 
care to admit. It shook me to the 
very core and, after Duckworth had 
turned off the power, I was deter- 
mined to be a better man. 

“I have some things I must tell 
my wife,” I said. 

“Later,” said Duckworth. 

He peered at me closely. 

“You do look as though you 
had been through an ordeal. I 
guess it’s my turn now.” 

“Don’t,” I warned. 

“I have to.” 

I helped place the electrodes 
about his chest, scalp and arms 
and then turned on the power. 
Duckworth lifted the earphones to 
his head and his face turned a 
bloodless shade. 1 averted my 
eyes, recalling what I had gone 
through. 

When it was over, Duckworth 
said nothing. Quietly we dis- 
assembled the cables and put 
away all of the loose gear. After 
we had left the computer room 
Duckworth turned to me. 

“Would you dare to let anyone 
else hear your music?” 

“Only my psychoanalyst,” I 
said. 

“I agree,” said Duckworth. “I 



must write a letter of apology to 
Dr. Steersford.” 

Steersford had been Duckworth’s 
rival for the Nobel Prize. I 
discreetly did not ask Duckworth 
why he was writing. He fished out 
his wallet and handed me a bill. 

“The twenty 1 owed you,” he 
said. 

“I’d forgotten all about it.” 

“I know,” said Duckworth. 
“I’m going off now. I want to 
rewrite some grant proposals 
that are filled with exaggerations.” 

I took hold of his arm. 

“Duckworth,” I said. “Don’t 
you see what we have on our 
hands?” 

The beady eyes became reflective 
and he stroked his wispy beard. 

“I know what you mean. 
Listening to this music has made 
us see into our very souls. As a 
consequence, we’ve become honest 
men and are determined to undo 
all of our misdeeds.” 

“Exactly,” 1 said. “With all 
due modesty, I don’t think our 
misdeeds amount to that much. 
But what if we could get someone 
in the power structure to listen 
to his soul song?” 

“It may not work on everybody,” 
said Duckworth. 

“Let’s give it the acid test,” 1 
said. “Try it on President 
Hinkle.” 

Duckworth winced. 



THE SOUL MUSIC OF DUCKWORTH’S DIBS 



93 




“Our university president and 
grand old man of science? It’s a 
grossly unfair test, but I agree.” 

G etting President Hinkle 
to participate in our experi- 
ment was a lot easier than I had 
expected. He arrived at the 
computer lab the following morn- 
ing and after applying the 
electrodes, I slipped the phones to 
his head. He was beaming 
genially all through the pre- 
liminaries and even humming a 
little tune whose lyrics were, as 1 
recall, quite bawdy. Then Duck- 
worth turned on the DIBS. 

Hinkle’s face lit up like a 
Christmas tree. He waved his arms 
about rhythmically and even 
hopped a little. I looked at 
Duckworth, perplexed, and his face 
reflected even greater amazement 
than mine did. Fifteen minutes 
later we turned off the computer. 

“Oh pshaw,” said President 
Hinkle. “Is it over so soon? 
Duckworth, you’ve outdone your- 
self. What a perfectly charming 
musical device!” 

“Were you pleased with the 
music?” asked Duckworth. 

“Pleased? My boy, that’s the 
greatest understatement of them 
all. It was grand, noble, 
illuminating. It was an amazing 
journey into my soul and every- 
thing I saw pleased me.” 



“I see,” I said. 

After I removed the electrodes 
and helped Hinkle back into his 
shirt he spoke once again. 

“One thing more,” he said. “This 
experience has also helped me 
make up my mind about a couple 
of things that had been hanging 
fire. I’m going to accept the sug- 
gestion of the Trustees to start 
constructing a twenty-five-foot 
statue of me. I’m also going to let 
them double my salary.” 

“At a time when everyone else 
is being asked to accept a ten 
per cent cut?” I cried. 

The question was indiscreet 
but I was unable to stop myself. 

“Only a truly big man can 
accept honors without mock 
humility,” said President Hinkle. 

He leaned over, shook Duck- 
worth’s hand and then mine. He 
waved blithely before leaving 
the computer lab. 

When he had gone, I shook my 
head sadly. 

“That takes the cake, Duck- 
worth,” I said bitterly. “In his 
case, it reinforced every egoman- 
iacal tendency he has ever had. 
And God knows he didn’t need 
any reinforcement.” 

“You’re right,” said Duckworth. 
“The machine is a failure. It 
makes people who are basically 
decent more so.” 

“And the loathsome ones even 



94 



GALAXY 




more so,” I added, “it certainly 
would be a way of separating the 
sheep from the goats.” 

“Do 1 need a complex technolog- 
ical mishmash to tell a louse when 
1 see him?” cried Duckworth. 

“No, but think what a help it 
would be in personnel offices. 
Those who would be upset could 
be steered into the lower echelon 
jobs. And the ones who enjoy 
listening to their soul music 
would qualify for the executive 
posts. The Pentagon would buy 
a thousand of these devices.” 
Duckworth was inspecting the 
fire hose that lay in neat coils 
around its spindle. Then he 
deftly slipped the fire axe out of its 
niche. 

“Don’t do it, Duckworth,” I 
warned. “The Luddite approach 
will solve nothing.” 

“I designed it and I have the 
right to destroy it,” he snarled. 

“Not any more,” 1 said. 

“Besides, we’ve overlooked the 
most important aspect of all. 
So far no one has listened to 
someone else’s soul music. Think 
of the possibilities there.” 
Duckworth shuddered. 

“1 have.” 

“You can’t have!” I cried. 
“Look at it this way. Suppose 
every prospective bride and groom 
had to listen to the music of the 
other. Or better still — what if 



every candidate for political 
office, or any other position of 
trust, had to play his soul music 
for the people?” 

“We’d have no candidates,” 
said Duckworth. 

“Who’s the cynic now? Maybe 
you’re right. But suppose, just 
suppose, that people begin to 
strive to measure up to what 
they say they are. What a magni- 
ficent society would emerge!” 

“It’s a remote possibility,” said 
Duckworth. 

He hefted the axe in his palm 
and then carefully put it back on 
the wall. 

“What the hell,” he said, 
“what isn’t a remote possibility? 
I’ll give it a try. I’ll even agree to 
write a series of popular articles on 
the potential of the DIBS, 
provided that you help me.” 

“Of course,” 1 said. “But 1 
consider myself unworthy of 
the opporutnity.” 

“You are,” said Duckworth. 

We set about putting our leads 
away and closing up the DIBS. 
Duckworth chuckled for the first 
time that day. 

“Whaf s funny?”( 1 asked. 

Duckworth shrugged. 

“Who knows?” he said. “It just 
occurred to me that the DIBS 
may solve Mao’s problems on 
self-criticism.” 

And as far as I know, it did. ★

AMONG THE IMMORTALS

Wouldn't it be nice to live 
forever and walk among the stars? 



F elix weaver, m. d., 

hearing the door chimes, anti- 
cipated the repairman. He stood 
up quickly — the call was costing 
him money. 

Opening the door. Dr. Weaver 
was pleased to note that the man 
was new. The last repairman had 
not done as well as he might have 
since the cooker was down again — 
and the new man (hopefully with 
a family) might be in need of 
medical services. With the pros- 
pects of immortality assured no 
man wanted to risk being carried 
off prematurely because of some 
correctable defect, no matter 
how remote the possibility was. 

“It’s the cooker again,” said 
Dr. Weaver. 

“How do I get to it?” 

“Come along,” said Dr. Weaver. 
Dr. Weaver lived in one of the 
older houses, which had required 
extensive remodeling. What had 
formerly been the kitchen was 
now his medical laboratory. Be- 
yond this was his office, a re- 
modeled den, containing two 
chairs and his mahogany desk. 
The food-preparation unit was en- 
tered from the dining room via 
a concrete stairway. 

Dr. Weaver lighted the stairway 
for the repairman and the two of 
them descended. At the bottom 
the repairman examined the meal 
preparer briefly, then went to his 



bag, which he had put down at the 
foot of the stairs. He opened it and 
began unpacking. Soon his instru- 
ments lay around him — meters, 
probes, an oscilloscope and a 
small computer. 

“Let’s plug this thing in and 
see,” he said. 

Dr. Weaver drew out his business 
card and fingered it nervously. 
One always sought clients — the 
story of a physician’s life. One 
spoke of strange diseases that 
might be encountered as a result 
of the night air and for which all- 
purpose injections were adminis- 
tered. Occasionally one could 
avail oneself of an epidemic 
scare and business would be good 
for a week or two. Failing 
epidemics, all were advised to have 
their systems depoisoned at 
least every six months to be on the 
safe side, since you could never 
know for sure what lethal agents 
accidentally got into the air and 
the food. There was also a fair 
business in prescription analgesics 
and oxygen preparations for 
hangovers and in certain other 
miscellaneous services. On rare oc- 
casions one found a case where 
surgery of some sort was indicated 
and managed to snag a finder’s 
fee. Altogether not the best — but 
a living. 

Dr. Weaver stood on first one 
foot and then the other.

“Bread prices went up again 
today,” the repairman said. “It’s 
getting so a working man can’t 
make ends meet.” 

“That’s certainly true,” Dr. 
Weaver said. He felt the growth 
of maniacal rage. Murder, al- 
though severely dealt with, was not 
unknown. Dr. Weaver was a firm 
supporter of the President. 

“You’ll be glad to know that 
I’ll have this thing fixed in a 
jiffy. Computer picked up the 
trouble.” 

“You’ll have time for a cup of 
coffee, then?” Dr. Weaver said, 
knowing he was going to pay for 
a full hour in any event. 

“That’d be good,” said the 
repairman. 

“We’ll have it when you finish 
here,” said Dr. Weaver, shifting 
his weight and peering over the 
man’s shoulder. 

The repairman, somewhat dis- 
pleased with the continuing super- 
vision, stopped and sat down. 
“Let me tell you what I’m doing,” 
he said. “You see, this cooker 
unit is attached to your frozen 
storage compartment — where the 
food is kept — and there’s a little 
trigger that is supposed to start 
it up when the food comes sliding 
down that chute over there. Now, 
this little trigger has caused us a 
lot of trouble in the — ” 

“Just call me when you finish.” 



“ — a lot of trouble, I was saying, 
in development, because the opera- 
tion is quite complex. You have to 
consider that the cooker has to 
maintain different levels of heat in 
various areas if you want the food 
all to come out at the same time.” 
“I understand that,” said Dr. 
Weaver, “and I really have to go 
now.” He fled the repairman. If 
angered sufficiently the man might 
follow him about the house, from 
room to room, explaining the 
operation of the equipment. Re- 
pairmen had been known to do so. 

D r. weaver waited in his 
laboratory — in what used to 
be the kitchen when cooking was 
still done manually. The lab’s 
contents had been given to him on 
his graduation from medical 
school — at the rates possible in 
his practice it would have taken 
him ten lifetimes to pay for it. 
He could, of course, do no major 
repairs on the equipment. That was 
for the engineers, who went to 
school a number of years longer 
than he did. The human body, 
when all was said and done, was 
basically less complex than many 
electronic devices. In the human 
organism only a half-dozen im- 
portant chemical reactions plus 
a few mechanical things could 
still go wrong. Like a radio, it was 



98 



GALAXY 




comparatively simple, self-renew- 
ing and built to last forever. 

The repairman came up shortly. 
“There,” he said. “That ought to 
do it. I thought I might have to 
replace the trigger unit, but you 
were lucky this time. Tell your 
wife to watch for sensitive tempera- 
ture differences — she works it too 
hard and it will be down again in- 
side a year. You have to learn to 
treat these cooker units right if 
you want them to last.” 

“I’ll tell her.” 

The repairman seated himself, 
apparently pleased with the speed 
with which the trouble had been 
located and repaired. “Here I am 
working twenty hours a week,” 
he said, “and the rest of the world 
is coming along nicely without 
working this hard. Why do you 
suppose they spend our tax 
dollars trying to industrialize 
Asia?” 

Dr. Weaver thought, suddenly 
despairing, that the future was 
shaped by the present. The 
majority, in the end, would go 
where they wanted to go. An 
industrialized Asia would need 
more repairmen than doctors. 
There was little Dr. Weaver could 
do. His anger returned. He drew 
coffee for the two of them, his 
hand shaking with the emotion. 
Thirty minutes were still left of 
the hundred-and-seventy-five-dol- 



lar hour. He knew that some day 
he was going to kill somebody. 

The repairman said, “And think 
of how many years we’ve wasted 
fiddling with science — and the 
tax dollars down that rathole, 
too.” 

Dr. Weaver suggested, “In this 
day and age it’s hard to see how 
anybody can figure out a new way 
to go insane.” 

“And it’s difficult, if I may say 
so as an engineer, imagining the 
degree of sanity of a man who 
thinks he’s fiddling around with 
the fundamental fabric of the 
space-time continuum and expects 
to have any success with it.” 

“I’m not too much up on theory,” 
Dr. Weaver said. “But wouldn’t 
you like to see us able to explore 
other star systems, not just our 
eight other little planets here? Some 
day we might be able to walk out 
there, once we get the equipment 
built — and we may need Asia to 
help us build the equipment. It 
seems to me that we ought to 
support the President completely 
in this.” 

“Can you tell me why we should 
do it, though? That’s all I’m 
asking.” 

Images drifted through Dr. 
Weaver’s mind of other planets 
circling other stars. “We’d reap a 
lot of technological benefits.” 

“We got all we need.” 



MEDICAL PRACTICES AMONG THE IMMORTALS

T he blind rage filled Dr. 

Weaver again, but somehow he 
could never get it out in words and 
it lay penned. Why should he be so 
interested in getting to the stars? 
What more .did a man really need 
than what he already had? Nearly 
everyone felt like the repairman 
and yet, to Dr. Weaver, that was 
wrong. They were all wrong some- 
how. It was necessary to get the 
planet into order and go out among 
the stars. 

“If it weren’t for these high taxes 
and having to work my butt off 
every week,” the repairman con- 
tinued, “I’d be perfectly happy. 
Let me tell you, I would be.” 

Dr. Weaver felt the rage retreat, 
followed by despair. 

“Nice place you got here,” said 
the repairman, putting four spoons 
of sugar in the coffee, stirring. 

“Thank you, we like it. I’m just 
a physician, an M.D., and we 
survive. Do you have any children?” 
“One. He’s two now. We plan 
our other one when this one’s out 
of college. I think it’s better to 
space them out. I know a lot of 
people wind up not wanting to be 
bothered with the second one if 
they wait — but 1 think I’ll take that 
route.” 

“We did,” said Dr. Weaver. 
“Our first is seventeen and we’re 
seriously thinking about a second 
now.” 



“Seventeen?” asked the repair- 
man. “What do you think these 
teenagers are up to? Just don’t 
understand them. What are they 
looking for? Running all over these 
agricultural countries and upsetting 
whole economies.” 

Dr. Weaver knew that an ex- 
tended discussion along this line 
would only alienate beyond recall 
a potential client. Further more, it 
would continue to subject him to 
the alternate waves of fury and 
despair. 

“May I give you my business 
card?” he asked. “In case you need 
the services of a physician. I think 
you’re right on raising the child. 
A child really deserves undivided 
attention for the first fifteen years 
at least. It’s a wise choice you’ve 
made. Maybe I could show you my 
little laboratory? It’s very well 
finished.” 

“I can see that. That’s a nice 
model of the cell monitor.” 

“Well, you don’t need to have 
this stuff described to you, but it is 
well set up. With this equipment, 
I can locate any organic defect you 
can name. Now, obviously, most 
aren’t important — though one 
should keep an eye on them — but 
you can never be sure without 
professional advice — ” 

The repairman prepared to 
listen with interest, even though — 
barring accident, poison or irrepar- 



100 



GALAXY 




able organic defects of a genetic 
nature — he could live as long as 
he wanted to. Basically longevity 
was merely a question of eliminat- 
ing the death wish and keeping the 
glands in proper adjustment to pre- 
vent aging. 

“The full examination costs only 
five hundred dollars,” Dr. Weaver 
said. “And then 1 give you the 
shots you need without any other 
charge — 1 throw them in free. 
Now, of course, there’s a routine 
check, which is virtually as good 
and which 1 can handle for seven- 
teen-fifty, with a six-dollar, 
twenty-five-cent charge for each 
shot — the total seldom runs over 
ten. You’ll find that very competi- 
tive. Many of my patients let me 
set up a continuing program, which 
includes periodic depoisoning and 
is recommended by the medical 
association. I think you ought 
seriously to consider a program of 
that sort.” 

The repairman promised to think 
about dropping by. He had gone to 
a physician about six months ago, 
but you could never tell. What one 
man missed another might catch — 
and he might arrange a visit for his 
wife and baby to see how they 
liked it. If they liked the deal he 
would come himself and try the 
service. 

“Certainly love to have you,” 
said Dr. Weaver. 



In that moment Dr. Weaver 
suddenly wished he had gone into 
surgery to avoid the necessity for 
such arrangements as this. Still, a 
good surgeon was a person of great 
competence and there was no doubt 
that one had to have exceptional 
talent to start with— and worked 
hard to keep in practice for the 
few operations one did. Every film 
was reviewed and if a man turned 
in a really awkward performance 
he was pensioned off — and without 
the work a man had trained for he 
usually passed on between sixty- 
five and seventy, if not earlier. 

So maybe it was better to be just 
an M.D. instead of a surgeon. Dr. 
Weaver was looking forward to a 
good long life. He thanked the 
repairman at the door, signed the 
slip and repeated how pleased he 
would be to meet the repairman’s 
wife and child. 

He went back to his office. It 
was a little early for his next 
appointment — a Mrs. Christian- 
son. She wanted a chemical modifi- 
cations to her body hair for some 
strange reason. 

Dr. Weaver flipped on for the 
news printout. 

The lead story was about a man 
who’d just turned a hundred and 
twenty. A real rarity. Dr. Weaver 
looked over the suicide list to see if 
there was anyone on it he had 
known. •#

T here was always the danger 
of being found out. David 
Selig knew he had to be on his 
guard. This was an era of witch- 
hunters, when anyone who departed 



from community norms was fer- 
reted out and burned at the stake. 
Spies were everywhere, probing 
for young Selig’s secret. Even 
Miss Mueller, his biology teacher. 
She was a pudgy little poodle of a 
woman, about forty, glum face, 
dark arcs under her eyes. Miss 
Mueller was very deep into 
extrasensory and occult phenom- 
ena. Of course they didn’t use 
phrases like “very deep into” in 
1949, when David Selig was in her 
class, but let the anachronism 
stand — she was ahead of her time, 
a hippie born too soon. She really 
grooved behind the irrational, the 
unknown. She knew her way 
around the high school bio 
curriculum in her sleep, which was 
more or less the way she taught it, 
but what really turned her on were 
things like telepathy, clairvoyance, 
telekinesis, astrology, the whole 
parapsychological bag. It didn’t 
take much to nudge her away from 
the day’s assignment, the study of 
metabolism or the circulatory 
system or whatever, and onto one 
of her hobbyhorses. She was the 
first on her block to own the / 
Ching. She had done time inside 
orgone boxes. She believed that 
the Great Pyramid of Gizeh held 
divine revelations for mankind. 
She had sought deeper truths by 
way of Zen, General Semantics, 
the Bates eyesight exercises and 
the readings of Edgar Cayce. 

Naturally she kept up with the

ception that J.B. Rhine was 
doing down at Duke University. 
She terrified David whenever she 
spoke of this. He constantly feared 
that she was going to give way to 
the temptation to run some 
Rhine experiments in class and 
would thereby flush him out of 
hiding. He had read Rhine himself, 
of course, hoping to find something 
that would explain him to himself, 
but there was nothing there except 
statistics and foggy conjecture. 
Okay, Rhine was no threat to him 
so long as he went on piddling 
around in North Carolina. But 
muddled Miss Mueller might 
just strip him naked and deliver 
him to the pyre. 

Inevitable, the progression to- 
ward disaster. The topic for the 
week, suddenly, was the human 
brain, its functions and capabilities. 
See, this is the cerebrum, this is the 
cerebellum, this is the medulla 
oblongata. A child’s garden of 
synapses. Fat-cheeked Norman 
Heimlich, gunning for a 99, 
knowing precisely which button 
to push, put up his hand. 

“M iss Mueller, do you think 
it’ll ever be possible for people 
really to read minds, I mean not 
by tricks or anything but actual 
mental telepathy?” 

This was her cue to launch into 
an animated discussion of ESP, 
parapsychology, inexplicable phe- 
nomena, supernormal modes of 
communication and perception, 
the Rhine researches, et cetera. 



et cetera. David wanted to hide 
under his desk. The word “telep- 
athy” made him wince. He al- 
ready suspected that half the 
class realized what he was. Now 
came a flash of wild paranoia. Are 
they looking at me, are they 
staring and pointing and tapping 
their heads and nodding? He had 
surveyed every mind in the class 
again and again, desperately trying 
to amuse himself during the arid 
stretches of boredom, and he knew 
that his secret was safe. His 
classmates, plodding young 
Brooklynites all, would never 
cotton to the veiled presence of a 
superman in their midst. They 
thought he was strange, yes, but 
had no notion of how strange. 
Would Miss Mueller now blow 
his cover, though? 

N O ESCAPE. She had her 
cards with her the next day. 
“These are known as Zener cards,” 
she explained solemnly, holding 
them up, fanning them out like 
Wild Bill Hickok about to deal 
himself a straight flush. David had 
never actually seen a set of the 
cards before, yet they were as 
familiar to him as the deck his 
parents used in their interminable 
canasta games. “They were 
devised about twenty-five years 
ago at Duke University by Dr. 
Karl E. Zener and Dr. J.B. Rhine. 
Another name for them is ‘ESP 
cards.’ Who can tell me what 
‘ESP’ means?”

Norman Heimlich’s stubby hand 
was waving in the air. “Extrasen- 
sory perception, Miss Mueller!” 
“Very good, Norman.” Absent- 
mindedly she began to shuffle the 
cards. Her eyes, normally inex- 
pressive, gleamed with a Las 
Vegas intensity. She said, “The 
deck consists of twenty-five cards, 
divided into five ‘suits’ or symbols. 
Five cards are marked with a star, 
five with a circle, five with a 
square, five with a pattern of wavy 
lines and five with a cross or plus 
sign. Otherwise they look just 
like ordinary playing cards.” She 
handed the pack to Barbara Stein, 
another of her favorites, and told 
her to copy the five symbols on the 
blackboard. “The idea is for the 
subject being examined to look at 
each card in turn, face down, and 
try to name the symbol on the other 
side. The test can be run in many 
different ways. Sometimes the 
examiner looks briefly at each card 
first — this gives the subject a 
chance to pick the right answer out 
of the examiner’s mind if he can. 
Sometimes neither the subject nor 
the examiner sees the card in ad- 
vance. Sometimes the subject is 
allowed to touch the card before he 
makes his guess. Sometimes he 
may be blindfolded and at other 
times he may be permitted to 
stare at the back of each card. No 
matter now it’s done, though, the 
basic aim is always the same — 
the subject is to determine, using 
extrasensory powers, the design on 



a card that he can’t see. Estelle, 
suppose the subject has no 
extrasensory powers at all, but is 
simply operating on pure guess- 
work. How many right guesses 
could we expect him to make out 
of the twenty-five chances?” 

Estelle, caught by surprise, 
reddened and blurted, “Uh — 
twelve and a half?” 

A sour smirk from Miss 
Mueller, who turned to Estelle’s 
brighter, happier twin. “Beverly?” 
“Five, Miss Mueller?” 

“Correct. You always have one 
chance out of five of guessing the 
right suit, so five right calls out of 
twenty-five is what luck alone 
ought to bring. Of course, the re- 
sults are never that neat. On one 
run through the deck you might 
have four correct hits and the next 
time six — then five, then maybe 
seven and then perhaps only 
three — but the average over a long 
series of trials ought to be about 
five. That is, if pure chance is the 
only factor operating. Actually, 
in the Rhine experiments, some 
groups of subjects have averaged 
six and a half or seven hits out of 
twenty-five over many tests. 
Rhine believes that this above-aver- 
age performance can only be 
explained as ESP. And certain 
subjects have done much better. 
There was a man once who 
called nine straight cards right for 
two days in a row. A few days later 
he hit fifteen straight cards, 
twenty-one out of twenty-five. The 



106 



GALAXY 




odds against that feat are fantastic. 
How many of you think it could 
have been nothing but luck?” 

About a third of the hands in the 
class went up. One of the hands 
belonged to David Selig. He was 
merely trying to don protective 
coloration. 

Miss Mueller said, “Let’s run a 
few tests today. Victor, will you 
be our first guinea pig? Come to 
the front of the room.” 

Victor Schlitz shambled forward. 
He stood stiffly beside Miss 
Mueller’s desk as she cut the cards 
and cut them again. After peering 
quickly at the top card she slid it 
toward him. “Which symbol?” 
she asked. 

“Circle?” 

“We’ll see. Class, don’t say any- 
thing.” She handed the card to 
Barbara Stein, telling her to place 
a checkmark under the proper 
symbol on the blackboard. 
Barbara checked the square. Miss 
Mueller glanced at the next card. 
Star, David thought. 

“Waves,” Victor said. Barbara 
checked the star. 

“Plus.” Square, dummy! Square. 

“Circle.” Circle. Circle. A 
sudden ripple of excitement in 
the classroom at Victor’s hit. Miss 
Mueller, glaring, called for 
silence. 

“Star.” Waves. Waves was what 
Barbara checked. 

“Square.” Square, David agreed. 
Square. Another ripple, more 
subdued. 



V ICTOR went through the 
deck. Miss Mueller had kept 
score: four corrrect hits. Not even 
as good as chance. She put him 
through a second round. Five. 
All right, Victor — you may be 
sexy, but a telepath you aren’t. 
Miss Mueller’s eyes roved the 
room. Another subject? Let it not 
be me, David prayed. God, let it 
not be me. It wasn’t. She sum- 
moned Sheldon Feinberg. He hit 
five the first time, six the second. 
Respectable, unspectacular. Then 
Alice Cohen. Four and four. 
Stony soil. Miss Mueller. David, 
following each turn of the cards, 
had hit twenty-five out of twenty- 
five every time, but he was the only 
one who knew that. 

“Next?” Miss Mueller said. 
David shrank into his seat. How 
much longer until the dismissal 
bell? “Norman Heimlich.” Nor- 
man waddled toward the teacher’s 
desk. She glanced at a card. 
David, scanning her, picked up the 
image of a star. Bouncing then to 
Norman’s mind, David was amazed 
to detect a flicker of an image 
there, a star perversely rounding 
its points to form a circle, then 
reverting to being a star. What was 
this? Did the odious Heimlich have 
a shred of the; power? “Circle,” 
Norman murmured. But he hit the 
next one — the waves — and the one 
after that, the square. He did 
indeed seem to be picking up 
emanations, fuzzy and indistinct 
but emanations all the same. 



DYING INSIDE 



107 




from Miss Mueller’s mind. Fat 
Heimlich had the vestiges of the 
gift. But only the vestiges. David, 
scanning his mind and the 
teacher’s, watched the images grow 
ever more cloudy and vanish al- 
together by the tenth card, fa- 
tigue scattering Norman’s feeble 
strength. He scored a seven, 
though, the best so far. The bell, 
David prayed. The bell, the bell, 
the bell! Twenty minutes away. 

A small mercy. Miss Mueller 
briskly distributed test paper. She 
would run the whole class at once. 
“I’ll call numbers from one to 
twenty-five,’’ she said. “Write 
down the symbol you think you see 
as I call each number. Ready? 
One.’’ 

David saw a circle. Waves, he 
wrote. 

Star. Square. 

Waves. Circle. 

As the test neared its close, it 
occurred to him that he might be 
making a tactical error by muf- 
fing every call. He told himself 
to put down two or three right ones, 
just for camouflage. But it was 
too late for that. There were only 
four numbers left, it would look 
too conspicuous if he hit several 
of them correctly after missing all 
the others. He went on missing. 

Miss Mueller said, “Now ex- 
change papers with your neighbor 
and mark his answers. Ready? 
Number one; circle. Number two: 
star. Number three: waves. Num- 
ber four . .’’ 



Tensely she called for results. 
Had anyone scored ten hits or 
more? No, teacher. Nine? Eight? 
Seven? Norman Heimlich had 
seven again. He preened himself — 
Heimlich the mind-reader. David 
felt disgust at the knowledge that 
Heimlich had even a crumb of 
power. Six? Four students had 
six. Five? Four? Miss Mueller 
diligently Jotted down the results. 
Any other figures? Sidney Gold- 
blatt began to snicker. “Miss 
Mueller, how about zero?” 

She looked startled. “Zero? Was 
there someone who got all twenty- 
five cards wrong?” 

“David Selig did!” 

AVID SELIG wanted to 
drop through the floor. All 
eyes were on him. Cruel laughter 
assailed him. David Selig got 
them all wrong. It was like saying, 
David Selig wet his pants, David 
Selig cheated on the exam, 
David Selig went into the girls’ 
toilet. By trying to conceal himself 
he had made himself terribly 
conspicuous. Miss Mueller, looking 
stern and oracular, said, “A null 
score can be quite significant, too, 
class. It might mean extremely 
strong ESP abilities rather than 
the total absence of such powers, 
as you might think.” Oh, God. 
Extremely strong ESP abilities. 
She went on, “Rhine writes of 
phenomena such as ‘forward 
displacement’ and ‘backward dis- 
placement,’ in which an unusually 




108 



GALAXY 




powerful ESP force might ac- 
cidentally focus on one card 
ahead of the right one or one card 
behind it — or even two or three 
cards away. So the subject would 
appear to get a below-average 
result when actually he’s hitting 
perfectly, just off the target! David, 
let me see your answers.” 

“1 wasn’t getting anything. Miss 
Mueller. 1 was just putting down 
my guesses and 1 suppose they 
were all wrong.” 

“Let me see.” 

As though marching to the 
scaffold, he brought her the sheet. 
She placed it beside her own list 
and tried to realign it, searching 
for some correlation, some dis- 
placement sequence. But the 
randomness of his deliberately 
wrong answers protected him. A 
forward displacement of one card 
gave him two hits. A backward 
displacement of one card gave 
him three. Nothing significant 
there. Nevertheless, Miss Mueller 
would not let go. “I’d like to test 
you again,” she said. “We’ll run 
several kinds of trials.” She began 
to shuffle the deck. God, God, God, 
where are you? Ah. The bell! 
Saved by the bell! “Can you stay 
after class?” she asked. In agony 
he shook his head. “Got to go to 
geometry next. Miss Mueller.” 
She relented. Tomorrow, then. 
We’ll run the tests tomorrow, 
(iod! He was up all the night in 
a turmoil of fear, sweating, 
shivering — about four in the

morning he vomited. He hoped his 
mother would make him stay 
home from school, but no luck. 
At half-past seven he was aboard 
the bus. Would Miss Mueller 
forget about the test? Miss 
Mueller had not forgotten. The 
fateful cards were on her desk. 
There would be no escape. He 
found himself the center of all 
attention. All right, Duv, be 
cleverer this time. “Are you ready 
to begin?” she asked, tipping up the 
first card. He saw a plus sign in 
her mind. 

“Square,” he said. 

He saw a circle. “Waves,” he 
said. 

He saw another circle. “Plus.” 

He saw a star. “Circle,” he said. 

He saw a square. “Square,” he 
said. That’s one. 

He kept careful count. Four 
wrong answers, then a right one. 
Three wrong answers, another right 
one. Spacing them with false 
randomness, he allowed himself 
five hits on the first test. On the 
second he had four. On the third, 
six. On the fourth, four. He 
wondered, am I being too average? 
Should I give her a one-hit run 
now? But she was losing interest. 
“1 still can’t understand your null 
score, David,” she told him. “But 
it does seem to me as if you have 
no ESP ability whatever.” He tried 
to look disappointed. Apologetic, 
even. Sorry, teach, I ain’t got no 
ESP. Humbly the deficient boy 
made his way to his seat. 



I N ONE blazing instant of 
revelation and communion. 
Miss Mueller, 1 could have justified 
your whole lifelong quest for the 
improbable, the inexplicable, the 
unknowable, the irrational. The 
miraculous. But 1 didn’t have the 
guts to do it. 1 had to look after 
my own skin. Miss Mueller. 1 had 
to keep a low profile. Will you 
forgive me? Instead of giving you 
truth, 1 faked you out, Miss 
Mueller, and sent you spinning 
blindly onward to the tarot, to 
the signs of the zodiac, to the 
flying-saucer people, to a thou- 
sand surreal vibrations, to a mil- 
lion apocalyptic astral antiworlds, 
when the touch of my mind against 
yours might have been enough 
to heal your madness. One touch 
from me. In a moment. In the 
twinkling of an eye.

AMONG the trivia I had once 
inadvertently picked up in 
Tom Nyquist’s mind were the 
results of some EEC and other 
tests to which he had submitted as 
a favor for a friend who was 
doing a Ph. D. thesis on electrical 
phenomena associated with the 
human brain and nervous system. 
Nyquist’s brain picture revealed 
nothing unusual except that the 
friend picked up, or thought he did, 
simultaneously identical patterns 
from Nyquist’s head and that of a 



110 



GALAXY 




subject whose mind Nyquist was 
reading — under circumstances that 
seemed to make the coincidence as 
remarkable as finding yourself 
shaking hands with a man whose 
fingerprints were duplicates of 
yours. Nyquist was amused by the 
fact that his friend’s subsequent 
thesis omitted all mention of both 
the tests and their results — the 
man wanted his doctorate. 

But Nyquist thought, without too 
much insistence, that perhaps he 
and I — products of genetic evolu- 
tion — emit some kind of “electro- 
magnetic” probe that operates as 
a myriad of electrodes might to 
soak up the microvolts and fre- 
quencies from the skulls of our 
victims. He once called ours the 
“superhuman condition.” For me 
the image conjured up is that of 
the leeching bat creature I found 
in Toni’s mind. 

W HEN Toni moved out of my 
place on 1 14th Street I 
waited two days before I did 
anything. I assumed she would 
come back when she calmed down. 

I figured she would call, contrite, 
from some friend’s house and 
say she was sorry she panicked 
and would 1 come get her. Also in 
those two days I was in no shape 
to take any sort of action. 1 was 
still suffering the after-effects of 
my vicarious trip. I felt as though 
someone had seized my head and 
pulled on it, stretching my neck 
like a rubber band, letting it 



finally snap back into place with a 
sharp thwock that addled my 
brains. 

' But she didn’t come back and 
she didn’t call and on the Tuesday 
after the acid trip 1 started 
searching for her. 1 phoned her 
office first. Teddy, her boss, a 
bland sweet scholarly man, very 
gentle, very gay. No, she hadn’t 
been to work this week. No, she 
hadn’t been in touch at all. Was it 
urgent? Would 1 like to have her 
home number? “I’m calling 
from her home number,” 1 said. 
“She isn’t here and 1 don’t know 
where she’s gone. This is David 
Selig, Teddy.” “Oh,” he said. 
Very faintly, with great compas- 
sion. “Oh.” And I said, “If she 
happens to call in will you tell her 
to get in touch with me?” 

Next I started to phone her 
friends, those whose numbers I 
could find: Alice, Doris, Helen, 
Pam, Grace. Most of them, I 
knew, didn’t like me. I didn’t have 
to be telepathic to realize that. 
They thought she was throwing 
herself away on me, wasting her 
life with a man without career, 
prospects, money, ambition, talent 
or looks. All five of them told me 
they hadn’t heard from her. 
Doris, Helen and Pam sounded 
sincere. The other two, it seemed 
to me, were lying. 

1 took a taxi over to Alice’s 
place in the Village and shot a 
probe upward, zam\ nine stories 
into her head, and I learned a lot 



DYING INSIDE 



111 




of things about Alice that I 
hadn’t really wanted to know, but 
I didn’t find out where Toni was. 
I felt dirty about spying and 
didn’t probe Grace. Instead I 
called my employer, the writer, 
whose book Toni was editing, and 
asked if he’d seen her. Not in 
weeks, he told me, all ice. Dead 
end. The trail had run out. 

1 dithered on Wednesday, won- 
dering what to do, and finally, 
melodramatically, called the police. 
Gave a bored desk sergeant her 
description: tall, thin, long dark 
hair, brown eyes. No bodies found 
in Central Park lately? In subway 
trash cans? The basements of 
Amsterdam Avenue tenements? 
No. No. No. Look, buddy, if we 
hear anything we’ll let you know, 
but it don’t sound serious to me. So 
much for the police. Restless, 
hopelessly strung out, I walked 
down to the Great Shanghai for a 
miserable half-eaten dinner, good 
food gone to waste. (Children are 
starving in Europe, Duv. Eat. Eat.) 

When I returned home the 
phone was ringing. Pam. “I’ve 
heard from Toni,” she said. 
“She’s staying with Bob Larkin 
at his place over on East Eighty- 
Third Street.” 

Jealousy, despair, humiliation. 

“Bob who?” 

“Larkin. He’s that high- 
bracket interior decorator she 
always talks about.” 

“Not to me.” 

“One of Toni’s oldest friends. 



They’re very close. 1 think he 
used to date her when she was in 
high school.” A long pause. Then 
Pam chuckled warmly into my 
numb silence. “Oh, relax, relax, 
David! He’s gay! He’s just a kind 
of father confessor for her. She 
goes to him when there’s trouble.” 

“I see.” 

“You two have broken up, 
haven’t you?” 

“I’m not sure. I suppose we have. 
I don’t know.” 

“Is there anything I can do to 
help?” This from Pam who, I had 
always thought, regarded me as a 
destructive influence of whom 
Toni was well advised to be quit. 

“Just give me his phone 
number,” I said. 

I phoned. It rang and rang and 
rang. At last Bob Larkin picked 
up. Gay, all right, a sweet tenor 
voice complete with lisp, not very 
different from the voice of Teddy- 
at-work. Who teaches them to 
speak with the homo accent? I 
asked, “Is Toni there?” A guarded 
response: “Who’s calling, please?” 
I told him. He asked me to wait 
and a minute or so passed while he 
conferred with her, hand over the 
mouthpiece. At last he came back 
and said Toni was there, yes, but 
she was very tired and resting and 
didn’t want to talk to me right 
now. “It’s urgent,” I said. 
“Please tell her it’s urgent.” 
Another muffled conference. Same 
reply. He suggested vaguely that 
I call back in two or three days. 



112 



GALAXY 




I started to wheedle, to whine, to 
beg. In the middle of that unheroic 
performance the phone abruptly 
changed hands and Toni said to 
me, “Why did you call?” 

“That ought to be obvious. I 
want you to come back.” 

“I can’t.” 

She didn’t say, / won’t. She said, 
I can't. 

I said, “Would you like to tell me 
why?” 

“Not really.” 

“You didn’t even leave a note. 
Not a word of explanation. You 
ran out so fast.” 

“I’m sorry, David.” 

“It was something you saw in 
me while you were tripping, wasn’t 
it?” 

“Let’s not talk about it,” she 
said. “It’s over.” 

“I don’t want it to be over.” 

“I do.” 

1 do. That was like the sound of 
a great gate clanging shut in my 
face. But I wasn’t going to let her 
throw home the bolts just yet. 
I told her she had left some of her 
things in my room, some books, 
some clothing. A lie — she had 
made a clean sweep. But I can be 
persuasive when I’m cornered and 
she began to think what I said 
might be true. I offered to bring 
the stuff over right now. She didn’t 
want me to come. She preferred 
never to see me again, she told me. 
But her voice lacked conviction. 
It was higher in pitch and much 
more nasal than it was when she 



spoke with sincerity. 1 knew she 
still loved me, more or less — 
even after a forest fire some of the 
burned snags live on and green new 
shoots spring from them. So I 
told myself. Fool that I was. In 
any case she couldn’t entirely turn 
me away. Talking very fast, I 
bludgeoned her into yielding. All 
right, she said. Come over. Come 
over. But you’re wasting your time. 

I T WAS close to midnight. The 
summer air was clinging and 
clammy, with a hint of rain on the 
way. No stars were visible. 
Larkin’s apartment was on the 
nineteenth floor of an immense new 
terraced white-brick tower, far over 
on York Avenue. Admitting me, he 
gave me a tender, compassionate 
smile as if to say. You poor 
bastard, you’ve been hurt and 
you’re bleeding and now you’re 
going to get ripped open again. He 
was about thirty, a stocky, boyish- 
faced man with long unruly curly 
brown hair and large uneven 
teeth. He radiated warmth and 
sympathy and kindness. I could 
understand why Toni ran to him at 
times like this. 

“She’s in the living room,” he 
said. 

It was a big, impeccable place, 
somewhat freaky in decor. 
Jagged blurts of color danced over 
the walls. Pre-Columbian artifacts 
gleamed in spotlighted showcases 
set among bizarre African masks, 
chrome-steel furniture. The living 



DVING INSIDE 



113 




room was the core of the spectacle, 
a vast white-walled enclosure with 
a long curving window. Toni sat 
at the far end, near the window, on 
an angular couch, dark blue 
flecked with gold. She wore old, 
dowdy cjothes that clashed 
furiously with the splendor around 
her: a motheaten red sweater that 
I detested, a short frumpy black 
skirt, dark hose — and she was 
slumped down sullenly on her 
spine, leaning on one elbow, her 
legs jutting awkwardly forward. 
The posture that made her look 
bony and ungraceful. A cigarette 
drooped in her hand and a huge 
pile of butts heaped the ashtray 
beside her. Her eyes were bleak. 
Her long hair was tangled. She 
didn’t move as I walked toward 
her. Such an aura of hostility 
came from her that I halted 
twenty feet away. 

“Where’s the stuff you were 
bringing?’’ she asked. 

“There wasn’t any. I just said 
that to have an excuse to see you.” 
“I figured that.” 

“What went wrong, Toni?” 
“Don’t ask. Just don’t ask.” 
Her voice had dropped into its 
lowest register, a bitter husky 
contralto. “You shouldn’t have 
come here at all.” 

“If you’d tell me what I did — ” 
“You tried to hurt me,” she said. 
“You tried to bum-trip me.” She 
stubbed out her cigarette and im- 
mediately lit another. Her eyes, 
somber and hooded, refused to 



meet mine. “I realized finally 
that you were my enemy, that 1 
had to escape from you. So I 
packed and got out.” 

“Your enemy? You know that 
isn’t true.” 

“It was strange,” she said. 
“I didn’t understand what was hap- 
pening and I’ve talked to some 
people who’ve dropped a lot of 
acid and they can’t understand it 
either. It was like our minds were 
linked, David. Like a telepathic 
channel had opened between us. 
And all sorts of stuff was pouring 
from you into me. Hateful stuff. 
Poisonous stuff. I was thinking 
your thoughts. Seeing myself as 
you saw me. Remember when you 
said you were tripping too, even 
though you hadn’t had any acid? 
And then you told me you were, 
like, reading my mind. That was 
what scared me. The way our 
minds seemed to blur together, to 
overlap. To become one. I never 
knew acid could do that to people.” 

This was my cue to tell her that 
it wasn’t only the acid, that it 
hadn’t been some druggy delusion, 
that what she had felt was the 
impingement of a special power 
granted me at birth — a gift, a curse, 
a freak of nature. But the words 
congealed in my mouth. They 
sounded insane to me. How could 
I confess such stuff? I let the 
moment pass. Instead I said 
lamely, “Okay, it was a strange 
moment for both of us. We were a 
little out of our heads. But the 



114 



GALAXY 




trip is over. You don’t have to 
hide from me now. Come back, 
Toni.” 

“No.” 

“In a few days, then?” 

“No.” 

“I don’t understand this.” 
“Everything’s changed,” she 
said. “I couldn’t ever live with 
you now. You scare me too much. 
The trip is over, but I look at 
you and I see demons. I see some 
kind of thing that’s half-bat, half- 
man, with big rubbery wings and 
long yellow fangs and — oh, Jesus, 
David, I can’t help any of this! 
I still feel as if our minds are 
linked. Stuff is creeping out of 
you into my head. 1 should never 
have touched the acid.” Care- 
lessly she crushed her cigarette and 
found another. “You make me 
uncomfortable now. I wish you’d 
go. It gives me a headache just 
being this close to you. Please. 
Please. I’m sorry, David.” 

I DIDN’T dare look into her 
mind. I was afraid that what 
I’d find there would blast and 
shrivel me. But in those days my 
power was still so strong that I 
couldn’t help picking up, whether 
I sought it or not, a generalized 
low-level mental radiation from 
everyone I came close to, and what 
I picked up now from Toni con- 
firmed what she was saying. She 
hadn’t stopped loving me. But the 
acid, though lysergic and not sul- 
furic, had scarred and corroded our 



relationship by opening that ter- 
rible gateway between us. It was 
torment for her to be in the same 
room with me. No resources of 
mine could deal with that. 1 con- 
sidered strategies, looked for 
angles of approach, ways to reason 
with her, to heal her through soft 
earnest words. No way. No way at 
all. I ran a dozen trial dialogs in 
my head and they all ended with 
Toni begging me to get out of her 
life. So. The end. She sat there all 
but motionless, downcast, dark- 
faced, her wide mouth clamped in 
pain, her brilliant smile extin- 
guished. She seemed to have aged 
twenty years. Her odd, exotic 
desert-princess beauty had wholly 
fled from her. Suddenly she was 
more real to me in her shroud of 
pain than ever before. Ablaze with 
suffering, alive with anguish. And 
no way for me to reach her. 

“All right,” I said quietly. “I’m 
sorry too.” 

Over, done with, swiftly, sud- 
denly, no warning, the bullet sing- 
ing through the air, the grenade 
rolling treacherously into the tent, 
the anvil falling from the placid 
sky. Done with. Alone again. Not 
even any tears. Cry? What shall 1 
cry? 

Bob Larkin had tactfully re- 
mained outside, in his long foyer 
papered with dazzling black and 
white optical illusions, during our 
brief muffled conversation. Again 
the gentle sorrowing smile from 
him as I emerged.

“Thanks for letting me bother 
you this late,” I said. 

“No trouble at all. Too bad 
about you and Toni.” 

We faced each other uncertainly 
and he moved toward me, digging 
his fingers momentarily into the 
muscle of my arm, telling me 
without words to shape up, to ride 
out the storm, to get myself to- 
gether. He was so open that my 
mind sank unexpectedly into his 
and I saw him plain, his goodness, 
his kindness, his sorrow. Out of him 
an image rose to me, a sharp encap- 
sulated memory: himself and a sob- 
bing, demolished Toni, the night 
before last, lying naked together 
on his modish round bed, her head 
cradled against his muscular hairy 
chest. Her body trembling with 
need. He struggling to offer her the 
consolation of sex. His gentle spirit 
at war with itself, flooded with 
pity and love for her but dismayed 
by her disturbing femaleness. You 
don’t have to. Bob, she keeps say- 
ing, you don’t have to, you really 
don’t have to, but he tells her he 
wants to, it’s about time we made 
it after knowing each other all 
these years. It’ll cheer you up, 
Toni, and anyway a man needs a 
little variety, right? His heart goes 
out to her but his body resists and 
their lovemaking, when it happens, 
is a hurried, pathetic, fumbled 
thing, a butting of troubled reluc- 
tant bodies, ending in tears, trem- 
ors, shared distress and, finally, 
laughter, a triumph over pain. 



He kisses her tears away. She 
thanks him gravely for his efforts. 
They fall into childlike sleep, side 
by side. How civilized, how tender. 
My poor Toni. Goodbye. Goodbye. 
“I’m glad she went to you,” I said. 
He walked me to the elevator. 
What shall 1 cry? “If she snaps out 
of it I’ll make sure she calls you,” 
he told me. 1 put my hand to his 
arm as he had to mine, and gave 
him the best smile in my repertoire. 
Goodbye.

T his is my cave. Twelve floors 
high in the Marble Hill Houses, 
Broadway and 228th Street, for- 
merly a middle-income municipal 
housing project, now a catchall for 
classless and deracinated urban 
detritus. Two rooms plus bath- 
room, kitchenette, hallway. Once 
upon a time you couldn’t get into 
this project unless you were mar- 
ried and had kids. Nowadays a few 
singles have slipped in, on the 
grounds that they’re destitute. 
Things change as the city decays 
— regulations break down. 

Would you like the guided tour 
of David Selig’s cave? Very well. 
Please come this way. No touching 
anything, please, and don’t park 
your chewing gum on the furniture. 
The sensitive, intelligent, amiable, 
neurotic man who will be your 
guide is none other than David 
Selig himself No tipping allowed. 
Welcome, folks, welcome to my 



116 



GALAXY 




humble abode. We’ll begin our 
tour in the bathroom. See, this is 
the tub — that yellow stain in the 
porcelain was already there when 
he moved in — this is the crapper, 
this is the medicine chest. Selig 
spends a great deal of time in here 
— it’s a room significant to any 
in-depth understanding of his 
existence. For example, he some- 
times takes two or three showers 
a day. What is it, do you think, 
that he’s trying to wash away? 
Leave that toothbrush alone, 
sonny. All right, come with me. 
Do you see these posters in the 
hallway? They are artifacts of the 
1960’s. This one shows the poet 
Allan Ginsberg in the costunre of 
Uncle Sam. This one is a crude 
vulgarization of a subtle topologi- 
cal paradox by the Dutch print- 
maker, M. G. Escher. Eight to ten 
years ago hundreds of thousands 
of young people decorated their 
rooms with such posters. Selig, 
although he was not exactly young 
even then, did the same. He often 
has followed current fads and 
modes in an attempt to affiliate 
himself more firmly with the struc- 
tures of contemporary existence. 

This room is the bedroom. Dark 
and narrow, with the low ceiling 
typical of municipal construction a 
generation ago. This is his bed, in 
which he dreams uneasy dreams, 
occasionally, even now, reading 
the minds of his neighbors and 
incorporating their thoughts in his 
fantasies. On this bed he has forni- 



cated maybe fifteen women, once 
or twice or sometimes three times 
each, during the two and a half 
years of his residence here. Don’t 
look so abashed, young lady! Sex 
is a healthy human endeavor and 
it remains an essential aspect of 
Selig’s life, even now in middle 
age! It may become even more 
important to him in the years 
ahead, for sex is, after all, a way 
of establishing communication 
with other human beings and cer- 
tain other channels of communica- 
tion appear to be closing for him. 
Who are these girls? Some of them 
are not girls. Some are women well 
along in life. He charms them in 
his diffident way and persuades 
them to share an hour of joy with 
him. He rarely invites any of them 
back and those whom he does in- 
vite back often refuse the invitation, 
but that’s all right. His needs are 
met. Please don’t sit on his bed. 
It’s an old one, bought second-hand 
at an upstairs bargain basement 
that the Salvation Army runs in 
Harlem. I picked it up for a few 
bucks when I moved out of my last 
place, a furnished room on St. 
Nicholas Avenue, and needed some 
furniture of my own. What else is 
in the bedroom? Very little of 
interest. I’m afraid. A chest of 
drawers containing commonplace 
clothing. A pair of worn slippers. 
A cracked mirror — are you super- 
stitious? A lopsided bookcase 
packed tight with old magazines 
that he will never look at again —

Partisan Review, Evergreen, Paris 
Review, New York Review of 
Books, Encounter. A mound of 
trendy literary stuff, plus a few 
journals of psychoanalysis and 
psychiatry, which Selig reads 
sporadicall/ in the hope of in- 
creasing his self-knowledge. He 
always tosses them aside in bore- 
dom and disappointment. Let’s get 
out of here. This room must be 
depressing you. We go past the 
kitchenette — four-burner stove, 
half-size refrigerator, formica- 
topped table — where he assembles 
very modest breakfasts and lunches 
(dinner he usually eats out) and 
enter the main focus of the apart- 
ment, the L-shaped blue-walled 
jam-packed living room/study. 

H ere you can observe the full 
range of Daivd Selig’s intel- 
lectual development. This is his 
record collection, about a hundred 
well-worn disks, some of them 
purchased as far back as 1951. 
Almost entirely classical music, 
although you will note two in- 
trusive deposits, five or six jazz 
records dating from 1959 and five 
or six rock records dating from 
1969, both groups acquired in 
vague, abortive efforts at expand- 
ing the horizons of his taste. Other- 
wise what you will find here, in the 
main, is pretty austere stuff, 
thorny, inaccessible: Schoenberg, 
late Beethoven, Mahler, Berg, the 
Bartok quartets, Bach passacaglias. 
Nothing that you’d be likely to 



whistle after one hearing. He 
doesn’t know a lot about music, 
but he knows what he likes — you 
wouldn’t much care for it. 

And these are his books, ac- 
cumulated since the age of ten and 
hauled lovingly about with him 
from place to place. The archae- 
ological strata of his reading can 
readily be isolated and examined. 
Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Mark 
Twain, Dashiell Hammett at the 
bottom. Sabatini. Kipling. Van 
Loon, The Story of Mankind. Ver- 
rill. Great Conquerors of South 
and Central America. The books of 
a sober, earnest, alienated little 
boy. Suddenly, with adolescence, 
a quantum leap: Orwell, Fitzgerald, 
Hemingway, Hardy, the easier 
Faulkner. Look at these rare paper- 
backs of the 1940’s and early 
1950’s, in odd off-sized formats, 
with laminated plastic covers! See 
what you could buy then for only 
25^1 These science-fiction books 
date from that era too. I gobbled 
the stuff whole, hoping to find some 
clues to my own dislocated seifs 
nature in the fantasies of Bradbury, 
Heinlein, Asimov, Sturgeon, 
Clarke. Look, here’s Stapledon’s 
Odd John, here’s Beresford’s 
Hampdenshire Wonder, here’s a 
whole book called Outsiders: 
Children of Wonder, full of stories 
of little superbrats with freaky 
powers. I’ve underlined a lot of 
passages in that last one, usually 
places where I quarreled with the 
writers. Outsiders? Those writers.

gifted as they were, were the out- 
siders, trying lO imagine powers 
they had never had, and I who was 
on the inside, 1 the youthful mind- 
prowler (the book is dated 1954), 
had bones to pick with them. They 
stressed the angst of being super- 
normal, forgot about the ecstasy. 
Although, thinking about angst 
vs. ecstasy now, 1 have to admit 
they knew whereof they writ. 
Fellows, 1 have fewer bones to 
pick these days. This is rats’ alley, 
where the dead men lost their 
bones. 

Observe how Selig’s reading be- 
comes more rarefied as we reach 
the college years. Joyce, Proust' 
Mann, Eliot, Pound, the old avant- 
garde hierarchy. The French 
period: Zola, Balzac, Montaigne, 
Celine, Baudelaire. This thick slug 
of Dostoyevsky occupying half a 
shelf. Lawrence. Woolf. The mys- 
tical era: Augustine, Aquinas, the 
Too Te Ching, the Bhagavad- 
Gita. The psychological era: Freud, 
Jung, Adler, Reich, Reik. The 
philosophical era. The Marxist 
era. All that Koestler. Back to 
literature: Conrad, Forster, Beck- 
ett. Moving on toward the frac- 
tured ’50’s: Bellow, Pynchon, 

Malamud, Mailer, Burroughs, 
Barth. Catch-22 and The Politics 
of Experience. Oh, yes, ladies and 
gentlemen, you are in the presence 
of a well-read man! 

Here we have his files. A trea- 
sure-trove of personalia awaiting 
a biographer yet unknown. Report 



cards, always with low marks for 
conduct. (“David shows little 
interest in his work and frequently 
disrupts the class.”) Crudely cray- 
oned birthday cards for his mother 
and father. Old photographs — can 
this fat freckled boy be the gaunt 
individual who stands before you 
now? This man with the high fore- 
head and the forced, rigid smile 
is the late Paul Selig, father of our 
subject, deceased 11 August 1971 
of complications following surgery 
for a perforated ulcer. This gray- 
haired woman with the hyperthy- 
roid eyes is the late Martha Selig, 
wife of Paul, mother of David, 
deceased 15 March 1973 of mys- 
terious rot of internal organs, 
probably cancerous. This grim 
young lady with cold knifeblade 
face is Judith Hannah Selig, 
adopted child of P. and M., un- 
loving sister of D. Date on back of 
photo: July 1963. Judith is there- 
fore eighteen years old and in the 
summertime of her hate for me. 
How much she looks like Toni in 
this picture! 1 never noticed the 
resemblance before, but they’ve 
got the same dusky Yemenite look, 
the same long black hair. But 
Toni’s eyes Were always warm and 
loving — except right at the very 
end — Jude’s eyes never held any- 
thing for me other than ice, ice, 
Plutonian ice. Let us continue with 
the examination of David Selig’s 
private effects. This is his collection 
of essays and term papers, written 
during his college years.

How fortunate for D. Selig that 
he kept all this literary twaddle — 
here in his later years these papers 
have become the capital on which 
he lives, for you know, of course, 
how the central figure of our in- 
vestigations earns his livelihood 
nowadays. • 

W HAT else do we find in these 
archives? The carbon copies 
of innumerable letters. Some of 
them are quite impersonal missives. 
Dear President Eisenhower. Dear 
Pope John. Dear Secretary-Gen- 
eral Hammarskjold. Quite often 
once — though rarely in recent 
years — he launched these letters 
to far corners of the globe. His fit- 
ful unilateral efforts at making 
contact with a deaf world. His 
troubled futile attempts at re- 
storing order in a universe plainly 
tumbling toward the ultimate ther- 
modynamic doom. Shall we look 
at a few of these documents? 

. You say. Governor Rocke- 
feller, that "with nuclear weapons 
multiplying our security is depen- 
dent on the credibility of our will- 
ingness to resort to our deterrent. 
It is our heavy responsibility as 
public officials and as citizens to 
save the lives and to protect the 
health of our people. A lagging 
civil-defense effort cannot be 
excused by our conviction that 
nuclear war is a tragedy and that 
we must strive by all honorable 
means to assure peace.” Permit 
me to disagree. Your bomb-shelter 



program. Governor, is the project 
of a morally impoverished mind. 
To divert energy and resources 
from the search for a lasting peace 
to this ostrich-in-the-sand scheme 
is, I think, a foolish and dangerous 
policy that. 

The Governor, by way of reply- 
ing, sent his thanks and an offprint 
of the very speech Selig was pro- 
testing. Can one expect more? 

. Mr. Nixon, your entire cam- 
paign is pitched to the theory that 
America never had it so good under 
President Eisenhower, and so let's 
have four more years of the same. 
To me you sound like Faust, crying 
out to the passing moment, Bleibe 
doch, du bist so schoen! (Am / too 
literate for you, Mr. Vice Presi- 
dent?) Please bear in mind that 
when Faust utters those words, 
Mephistopheles arrives to collect 
his soul. Does it honestly seem to 
you that this instant in history is 
so sweet that you would stop the 
clocks forever? Listen to the an- 
guish in the land. Listen to the 
voices of Mississippi’s Negroes, 
listen to the cries of the hungry 
children of factory workers thrown 
out of work by a Republican reces- 
sion, listen to ... 

Dear Mrs. Hemingway: Please 
allow me to add my words to the 
thousands expressing sorrow at the 
death of your husband. The bravery 
he showed in the face of a life- 
situation that had become unendur- 
able and intolerable is indeed an 
example for those of us who.

Unfortunately we do not have 
the imaginary letters which he dic- 
tates constantly to himself but 
never sends. Dear Mr. Kierke- 
gaard: I agree entirely with your 
celebrated dictum equating "the 
absurd” with "the fact that with 
God all things are possible,” and 
declaring, "The absurd is not one 
of the factors which can be dis- 
criminated within the proper com- 
pass of the understanding: it is not 
identical with the improbable, the 
unexpected, the unforeseen.” In 
my own experience with the ab- 
surd. Dear Mr. Shakespeare: 
How aptly you put it when you say, 
"Love is not love which alters when 
it alteration finds. Or bends with 



the remover to remove." Your 
sonnet, however, begs the question: 
if love is not love, what then is it, 
that feeling of closeness which can 
be so absurdly and unexpectedly 
destroyed by a trifle? If you could 
suggest some alternate existential 
mode of relating to others that. 

Since they are transient, the pro- 
duct of vagrant impulses, and often 
incomprehensible, we have no 
satisfactory access to such commu- 
nications, which Selig sometimes 
produces at a rate of hundreds per 
hour. Dear Mr. Justice Holmes: 
In Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, 
244 U S. 205, 221 [1917], you 
ruled, "I recognize without hesi- 
tation that judges do and must 
legislate, but they can do so only 
interstitially; they are confined 
from molar to molecular motions.” 
This splendid metaphor is not en- 
tirely clear to me, I must confess, 
and. 

Dear Mr. Selig; 

The present state of the 
world and the whole of life is 
diseased. If 1 were a doctor 
and were asked for my advice, 
I should reply, “Create 
silence.”

tain letters of a rather more 
personal kind. Under the terms of 
our agreement with the David 
Selig Foundation I am forbidden 
to quote, though I may paraphrase. 
These are his letters to — and 
occasionally from — the girls he 
has loved or has wanted to love. 
The earliest ’is dated 1950 and 
bears the notation at the top in 
large red letters, NEVER SENT. 
Dear Beverly, it begins, and it is 
full of embarrassingly graphic 
sexual imagery. What can you tell 
us about this Overly, Selig? 

Well, she was short and cute and 
freckled, with big headlights and a 
sunny disposition and sat in front 
of me in my biology class. She 
had a creepy twin sister, Estelle, 
who scowled a lot and through 
some fluke of genetics was as flat 
as Beverly was bosomy. Maybe 
that was why she scowled so much. 
1 used to wander barefoot in Bev- 
erly’s mind while the teacher. Miss 
Mueller, droned on about mitosis 
and chromosomes. She had just 
yielded her cherry to Victor Schlitz, 
the big rawboned green-eyed red- 
haired boy who sat next to her. 1 
learned a lot about sex from her 
at one remove, with a 12-hour time- 
lag, as she radiated every morning 
her adventure of the night before 
with Victor. I wasn’t jealous of 
him. He was handsome and self- 
confident and deserved her, and I 
was too shy and insecure to lay 
anybody anyway, then. So I rode 
secretly piggyback on their ro- 



mance and fantasized doing with 
Beverly the gaudy things Victor 
was doing with her, until my ex- 
plorations of her head told me that 
to her I was just an amusing gnom- 
ish child, an oddity, a jester. How 
then to score? I wrote her this 
letter, describing in vivid sweaty 
detail everything that she and Vic- 
tor had been up to, and said. Don’t 
you wonder how I know all this, 
heh heh heh? The implication being 
that I’m some kind of superman 
with the power to penetrate the 
intimacies of a woman’s mind. I 
figured that would topple her right 
into my arms in a swoon of awe, 
but some second thoughts led me 
to see that she would either think 
I was crazy or a peeping tom. And 
would in either case be wholly 
turned off me. 1 filed the letter 
away undelivered. 

Most of the letters in this file 
date l)etween 1954 and 1968. The 
most recent was written in the 
autumn of 1974, after which time 
Selig began to feel less and less in 
touch with the rest of the human 
race and stopped writing letters, 
except in his head. I don’t know 
how many girls are represented 
here but there must have been quite 
a few. Generally these were all 
superficial affairs, for Selig, as 
you know, never married or even 
had many serious involvements 
with women. 

At times he made use of his 
special gifts knowingly to exploit 
women sexually, especially at about

the age of twenty-five. He is not 
proud of that period. Wouldn’t 
you like to read these letters, you 
stinking voyeurs? But you won’t. 
You won’t get your paws.on them. 

Why have 1 invited yoii in here, 
anyway? Why do I let you peer at 
my books and my photographs and 
my unwashed dishes and my 
stained bathtub? It must be that 
my sense of self is slipping. Iso- 
lation is choking me. The windows 
are closed but at least I’ve opened 
the door. I need you to bolster my 
grip on reality by looking into my 
life, by incorporating parts of it 
into your own experience, by dis- 
covering that I’m real, 1 exist, 1 
suffer, I have a past if not a future. 
So that you can go away from here 
saying. Yes, 1 know David Selig, 
actually I know him quite well. 
But that doesn’t mean I have to 
show you everything. Hey, here’s a 
letter to Amy! Amy who relieved 
me of my festering virginity in the 
spring of 1953. Wouldn’t you like 
to know the story of how that hap- 
pened? Anybody’s first time has 
an irresistible fascination. Well, 
I don’t feel like discussing it. It 
isn’t much of a story anyway. Make 
up the details yourself. 

Where’s Amy now? Amy’s dead. 
She died in an auto accident at the 
age of twenty-three and her hus- 
band, who knew me vaguely, 
phoned me to tell me, since I had 
once been a friend of hers. He was 
still in trauma because the police 
had made him come down to 



identify the body and she had 
really been destroyed, mangled, 
mutilated. Like something from 
another planet, that’s how she 
looked, he told me. Catapulted 
through the windshield and into a 
tree. And 1 told him, “Amy was 
the first girl 1 ever slept with,” and 
he started consoling me. He, con- 
soling me, and I had only been try- 
ing to be sadistic. 

Time passes. Amy’s dead and 
Beverly’s a pudgy middle-aged 
housewife, 1 bet. Here’s a letter to 
Jackie Newhouse, telling her 1 
can’t sleep for thinking about her. 
Jackie Newhouse? Who that? Oh, 
yes. Five feet two and a pair of 
boobs that would have made Mari- 
lyn Monroe feel topheavy. Sweet. 
Dumb. Puckered lips, baby-blue 
eyes. Jackie had nothing going for 
her at all except her bosom, but 
that was enough for me, seventeen 
years old and hung up on breasts, 
God knows why. 1 loved her for 
her mammaries, so globular and 
conspicuous in the tight white 
polo shirts she liked to wear. Sum- 
mer of 1952. She loved Frank Si- 
natra and Perry Como, and had 
FRANKIE written in lipstick down 
the left thigh of her jeans and 
PERRY on the right. She also loved 
her history teacher, whose name, 
I think, was Leoif Sissinger or 
Zippinger or something like that, 
and she had LEON on her jeans 
too, from hip to hip. 

I kissed her twice but that was 
all. She was even more shy than I,

terrified that some hideous male 
hand would violate the purity of 
those mighty knockers. I followed 
her around, trying not to get into 
her head because it depressed me to 
see how empty it was. How did it 
end? Oh, yes. Her kid brother 
Arnie was telling me how he sees 
her naked at, home all the time and 
I, desperate for a vicarious glimpse 
of her bare breasts, plunged into 
his skull and stole a second-hand 
peek. I hadn’t realized until then 
how important a bra can be. Un- 
bound, they hung to her plump 
little belly, two mounds of dangling 
meat crisscrossed by bulging blue 
veins. Cured me of my fixation. 
So long ago, so unreal to me now, 
Jackie. 

Here. Look. Spy on me. My 
fervid frenzied outpourings of love. 
Read them all, what do I care? 
Donna, Elsie, Magda, Mona, Sue, 
Lois, Karen. Did you think I was 
deprived? Did you think my lame 
adolescence sent me stumbling into 
manhood incapable of finding 
women? Dear Connie, what a wild 
night that was! Dear Chiquita, 
your perfume still lingers in the 
air. Dear Elaine, when I woke this 
morning the taste of you was on my 
lips. Dear Kitty, 1 — 

Oh, God. Kitty. Dear Kitty, I 
have so much to explain to you 
that I don't know where to begin. 
You never understood me, and I 
never understood you, and so the 
love I had for you was fated to 
bring us to a bad pass sooner or 



later. Which it now has. The fail- 
ures of communication extended 
all up and down our relationship^ 
but because you were different 
from any person I had ever known, 
truly and qualitatively different, I 
made you the center of my fan- 
tasies and could not accept you as 
you were, but had to keep ham- 
mering and hammering and ham- 
mering away at you, until — Oh, 
God. This one’s too painful. What 
the hell are you doing reading 
someone else’s mail? Don’t you 
have any decency? I can’t show 
you this. The tour’s over. Out! 
Out! Everybody out! For Christ’s 
sake, get out\ 

T uesday. Election Day. For 
months the clamor of the cam- 
paign has fouled the air. The free 
world is choosing its new maximum 
leader. The sound-trucks rumble 
along Broadway, belching slogans. 
Our next President. The man for all 
America. Vote! Vote! Vote! Vote 
for X! Vote for Y! The hollow 
words merge and blur and flow. 
Republocrat. Demican. Bourn. 
Why should I vote? 1 will not vote. 
I do not vote. 1 am not plugged in. 
I am not part of the circuit. Voting 
is for them. Once, in the late 
autumn of 1968, I think it was, I 
was standing outside Carnegie Hall 
when suddenly all traffic halted on 
57th. A motorcade came rumbling 
out of the east and lo! in a dark 
black limousine rode Richard M. 
Nixon, President-elect of the

United States of America. My big 
chance at last, I thought. I will look 
into his mind and make myself 
privy to great secrets of state. I will 
discover what is is about our 
leaders that sets them apart from 
ordinary mortals. I looked into his 
mind and what I found in there 1 
will not tell you, except to say that 
it was more or less what 1 should 
have expected to find. And since 
that day I have had nothing to do 
with politics or politicians. Today 
I stay home from the polls. Let 
them elect the next President 
without my help. 

W EDNESDAY. 1 doodle with 
Yahya Lumumba’s half- 
finished term paper and other such 
projects. Getting nowhere. Judith 
calls. “A party,” she says. “You’re 
invited. Everybody’ll be there.” 

“A party? Who? Where? Why? 
When?” 

“Saturday night. Near Columbia. 
The host is Claude Guermantes. 
Do you know him? Professor of 
French Literature.” No, the name 
is not Guermantes. 1 have changed 
the name to protect the guilty. 
“He’s one of those charismatic new 
professors. Young, dynamic, hand- 
some, a friend of Simone de 
Beauvoir, of Genet. Karl and I are 
coming. And a lot of others. He 
always invites the most interesting 
people.” 

“Genet? Simone de Beauvoir? 
Will they be there?” 

“No, silly, not them. But it’ll be 



worth your time. Claude gives the 
best parties of anybody I know. 
Brilliant combinations of people.” 
“Sounds like a vampire to me.” 
“He gives as well as takes, Duv. 
He specifically asked me to invite 
you.” 

“How does he know me at all?” 
“Through me,” she says. “I’ve 
talked of you. He’s dying to meet 
you.” 

“I don’t like parties.” 

“Duv — ” 

1 know that warning tone of 
voice. I have no stomach for a 
hassle just now. “All right,” I say, 
sighing. “Saturday night. Give me 
the address.” Why am I so pliable? 
Why do I let Judith manipulate me? 
Is this how I build my love for her, 
through these surrenders? 

T hursday. I do two para- 
graphs in the a.m. for Yahya 
Lumumba. Very apprehensive 
about his reaction to the thing I’m 
writing for him. He might just 
loathe it. If I ever finish it. I must 
finish it. Never missed a deadline 
yet. Don’t dare to. In the p.m. I 
walk up to the 230th Street book- 
store, needing fresh air and- want- 
ing, as usual, to see if anything 
interesting has come out since my 
last visit three days before. Com- 
pulsively I buy a few paperbacks — 
an anthology of minor metaphysi- 
cal poets, Updike’s Rabbit Redux 
and a heavy Levi-Straussian an- 
thropological study, folkways of 
some Amazonian tribe, that I know

I’ll never get around to reading. A 
new clerk at the cash register: a 
girl nineteen or twenty, pale, 
blond, white silk blouse, short 
plaid skirt. Attractive in a vacant- 
eyed way. She isn’t at all interesting 
to me sexually or otherwise. As I 
think that I chide myself for putting 
her down — let nothing human be 
alien to me — and on a whim I 
invade her mind as 1 pay for my 
books. I burrow in easily, deep, 
down through layer after layer of 
trivia, mining her without hind- 
rance, getting right to the real 
stuff. Oh! What a sudden blazing 
communion, soul to soul! She 
glows. She streams fire. She comes 
to me with a vividness and a com- 
pleteness that stun me, so rare has 
this sort of experience become for 
me. No dumb pallid mannequin 
now. I see her full and entire, her 
dreams, her fantasies, her ambi- 
tions, her loves, her soaring ecsta- 
sies (last night’s gasping copulation 
and the shame and guilt afterward), 
a whole churning steaming sizzling 
human soul. Only once in the last 
six months have I hit this quality of 
total contact, only once, that awful 
day with Yahya Lumumba on the 
steps of Low Library. And as 1 
remember that searing, numbing 
experience something is triggered in 
me and the same thing happens. A 
dark curtain falls. I am discon- 
nected. My grip on her conscious- 
ness is severed. Silence, that 
terrible mental silence, rushes to 
enfold me. 1 stand there, gaping. 



stunned, alone again and fright- 
ened. 1 start to shake and drop my 
change and she says to me, worried, 
“Sir? Sir?” in that sweet fluting 
little-girl voice. 

F riday. Wake up with aches, 
high fever. Undoubtedly an 
attack of psychosomatic ague. The 
angry, embittered mind mercilessly 
flagellating the defenseless body. 
Chills followed by hot sweats 
followed by chills. Empty-gut 
puking. I feel hollow. Headpiece 
filled with straw. Alas! Can’t work. 
I scribble a few pseudo-Lumumba- 
esque lines and toss the sheet away. 
Sick as a dog. Well, a good excuse 
not to go to that dumb party, 
anyhow. 

Felt better after a while. 1 should 
call Judith. Have her make some 
chicken soup for me. Oy, veh. Veh 
ist mir. 

S ATURDAY. Without help of 
chicken soup 1 recover and de- 
cide to go to the party. Veh ist mir, 
in spades. Why has David allowed 
Judith to drag him from his cave? 
An endless subway ride down- 
town. At last the familiar Colum- 
bia station. I must walk a few 
blocks, shivering, not dressed 
properly for the wintry weather, to 
the huge old apartment house at 
Riverside Drive and 1 12th Street 
where Claude Guermantes is re- 
puted to live. I stand hesitantly 
outside. A cold, sour breeze rip- 
ping malevolently across the Hud-

son at me, bearing the windborne 
detritus of New Jersey. Dead leaves 
swirling in the park. A mahogany 
doorman eyes me fishily. 

“Professor Guermantes?” I 
say. 

He jerks a thumb. “Seventh 
floor, 7-G.” Waving me toward 
the elevator. 

I’m late — now it’s almost ten 
o’clock. Upstairs in the weary Otis, 
creak creak creak creak, elevator 
door rolls back, silkscreen poster 
in the hallway proclaims the route 
to Guermantes’ lair. A high- 
decibel roar from the left tells me 
where the action is. I ring the bell. 
Wait. Nothing. Ring again. Party’s 
too loud for them to hear me. Oh, 
to be able to transmit thoughts in- 
stead of just to receive them! I’d 
announce myself in tones of 
thunder. Ring again, more aggres- 
sively. Ah! Yes! Door opens. Short 
dark-haired girl, undergraduate- 
looking, wearing a sort of orange 
sari that leaves her right breast — 
small — bare. Nudity a la mode. 
Flashes her teeth gaily. “Come in, 
come in, come in!’’ 

A mob scene. Eighty, ninety, a 
hundred people, everyone dressed 
in Seventies Flamboyant, gathered 
in groups of eight to ten, shouting 
profundities at one another. Those 
who hold no highballs are busily 
passing joints, ritualistic hissing in- 
take of breath, much coughing, 
passionate exhaling. Before I have 
my coat off someone pops an 
elaborate ivory-headed pipe in my 



mouth. “Super hash,” he explains. 
“Just in from Damascus. Come on, 
man, toke up!” I suck smoke willy- 
nilly and feel an immediate effect. 
1 blink. “Yeah,” my benefactor 
shouts. “It’s got the power to cloud 
men’s minds, don’t it?” In this mob 
my mind is already pretty well 
clouded, however, sans cannabis, 
solely from input overload. My 
power seems to be functioning at 
reasonably high intensity tonight, 
only without much differentiation 
of persons. 

I am involuntarily taking in a 
thick soup of overlapping trans- 
missions, a chaos of merging 
thoughts. Murky stuff. Pipe and 
passer vanish and I stumble 
stonedly forward into a cluttered 
room lined from floor to ceiling 
with crammed bookcases. 1 catch 
sight of Judith just as she catches 
sight of me, and from her on a 
direct line of contact comes her 
outflow, fiercely vivid at first, 
trailing off in moments into mush: 
brother, pain, love, fear, shared 
memories, forgiveness, forgetting, 
hatred, hostility, murmphness, 
froomz, zzzhhh, mmm. Brother. 
Love. Hate. Zzzhhh. 

“Duv!” she cries. “Oh, here I 
am, Duvid!” 

J UDITH looks sexy tonight. Her 
long lithe body is sheathed in a 
purple satiny wrap, skin-tight, 
throat-high, plainly showing her 
breasts and the little bumps of her 
nipples and the cleft between her

buttocks. On her bosom nestles 
a glittering slab of gold-rimmed 
jade, intricately carved. Her hair, 
unbound, tumbles gloriously. 1 
feel pride in her beauty. She is 
flanked by two impressive-looking 
men. On one side is Dr. Karl F. 
Silvestri, author of Studies in the 
Physiology of Thermoregulation. 
He corresponds fairly closely to the 
image of him that 1 had plucked 
from Judith’s mind at her apart- 
ment a week or two ago, though he 
is older than I had guessed, at least 
fifty-five, maybe closer to sixty. 
Bigger, too — perhaps six feet five. 
He has florid cheeks, a stolid self- 
satisfied facial expression, tender 
intelligent eyes. He radiates some- 
thing avuncular or even paternal 
toward her. I see why Jude is at- 
tracted to him — he is the powerful 
father figure that poor beaten Paul 
Selig never could have been for 
her. On Judith’s other side is a man 
whom I suspect to be Professor 
Claude Guermantes. 

I bounce a quick probe into him 
and confirm that guess. His mind 
is quicksilver, a glittering, shim- 
mering pool. He thinks in three or 
four languages at once. His ram- 
paging energy exhausts me at a 
single touch. He is about forty, just 
under six feet tall, muscular, ath- 
letics. He wears his elegant sandy 
hair in swirling baroque waves 
and his short goatee is impeccably 
clipped. His clothing is so advanced 
in style that I lack the vocabulary 
to describe it, being unaware of 



fashions myself — a kind of mantle 
of coarse green and gold fabric 
(linen? muslin?), a scarlet sash, 
flaring satin trousers, turned-up 
pointed-toed medieval boots. His 
dandyish appearance and mannered 
posture suggest that he might be 
gay, but he gives off a powerful 
aura of heterosexuality. From 
Judith’s stance and fond way of 
looking at him 1 begin to realize 
that he and she must once have 
been lovers. May still be. I am shy 
about probing that. My raids on 
Judith’s privacy are too sore a 
point between us. 

“I’d like you to meet my 
brother David,’’ Judith says. 

Silvestri beams. “I’ve heard so 
much about you, Mr. Selig.” 

“Have you really?” {I’ve got this 
freak of a brother, Karl. Would 
you believe it? He can actually 
read minds. Your thoughts are 
as clear as a radio broadcast to 
him.) How much has Judith actu- 
ally revealed about me? I’ll try to 
probe him and see. “And call me 
David. You’re Dr. Silvestri, right?” 

“That’s right. Karl. I’d prefer 
Karl.” 

“I’ve heard a lot about you from 
Jude,” I say. No go on the probe. 
My abominable waning gifts — I 
get only sputtering bits of static, 
misty scraps of unintelligible 
thought. His mind is opaque to me. 
My head starts to throb. “She 
showed me two of your books.” 

A pleased chuckle from lofty 
Silvestri. Judith meanwhile has 



128 



GALAXY 




begun to introduce me to Guer- 
mantes. He murmurs his delight 
at making my acquaintance. I 
half expect him to kiss my cheeks 
or maybe my hand. His voice is 
soft, purring — it carries an accent, 
but not a French one. Something 
strange, a mixture. Franco-italic, 
maybe, or Franco-Hispanic. Him 
at least I can probe even now — 
somehow his mind, more volatile 
than Silvestri’s, remains within my 
reach. I slither in and take a look. 
Christ! Casanova Redivivus! He’s 
slept with everything that walks 
or crawls, masculine feminine 
neuter, including of course my ac- 
cessible sister Judith. The profes- 
sor is speculating in a civilized way 
on the possibilities of nailing me 
before the night is out. No hope, 
professor. I will not be added to 
your Selig collection. He asks me 
pleasantly about my degrees. 

“Just one,” I say. “A B.A. in 
’fifty-six. 1 thought about doing 
graduate work in English literature 
but never got around to it.” 

He teaches Rimbaud, Verlaine, 
Mallarme', Baudelaire, Lautrdi- 
mont, that whole sick crew, and 
identifies with them spiritually. 
As he talks to me he fondles 
Judith’s shoulderblades affec- 
tionately, proprietorially. Dr. 
Silvestri appears not to notice, or 
else not to care. 

“Your sister,” Guermantes 
murmurs, “she is a marvel, she is 
an original, a splendor — a type. 
M’sieu’ Selig, a type." A compli- 



ment, in the froggish sense. He 
fascinates me — so blatant, so 
phony, so manipulative and yet 
so attractive despite all his trans- 
parent failings. He offers me cock- 
tails, highballs, liquers, brandies, 
pot, hash, cocaine, anything I 
crave. 1 feel engulfed and escape 
from him in some relief, slipping 
away to pour a little rum. 

A GIRL accosts me at the liquor 
- table. One of Guermantes’ 
students, no more than twenty. 
Coarse black hair tumbling into 
ringlets, pug nose, fierce perceptive 
eyes, full fleshy lips. Not beautiful 
but somehow interesting. Evidently 
1 interest her, too, for she grins at 
me and asks, “Would you like to 
go home with me?” 

“I just got here.” 

“Later. Later. No hurry.” 

“Do you say that to everybody 
you’ve just met?” 

“We haven’t even met,” she 
points out. “And no, 1 don’t say 
it to everybody. To lots, though. 
What’s wrong? Girls can take the 
initiative these days. Besides, it’s 
leap year. Are you a poet?” 

“Not really.” 

“You look like one. 1 bet you’re 
sensitive and you suffer a lot.” My 
familiar dopy fantasy, coming to 
life before my eyes. Her eyes are 
red-rimmed. She’s stoned. Her 
legs are too short for her torso, her 
hips too wide, her breasts too 
heavy. Is she putting me on? I bet 
you’re sensitive and you suffer a

lot. Are you a poet? 1 try to explore 
her, but it’s useless. Fatigue is 
blanking my mind and the collec- 
tive shriek of the massed mob of 
partygoers is drowning out all 
individual outputs. “What’s your 
name?” she asks. 

“David Selig.” 

“Lisa Holstein. I’m a senior at 
Barn — ” 

“Holstein?” The name triggers 
me. Kitty, Kitty, Kitty! “Is that 
what you said? Holstein?” 

“Holstein, yes, and spare me the 
cow jokes.” 

“Do you have a sister named 
Kitty? Catherine, I guess. Kitty 
Holstein. About thirty-five years 
old. Your sister, maybe your 
cousin — ” 

“No. Never heard of her. Some- 
one you know?” 

“Used to know,” I say. “Kitty 
Holstein.” I pick up my drink and 
turn away. 

“Hey,” she calls after me. “Did 
you think I was kidding? Do you 
want to go home with me tonight 
or don’t you?” 



<<qpOM NYQUIST- ” 

X The name leaps suddenly, 
startlingly, out of the white-noise 
background hum of party chatter. 
For an instant it hangs in the smoky 
air like a dead leaf caught by a lazy 
October breeze. Who said “Tom 
Nyquist” just then? Who was it 
who spoke his name? A pleasant 



baritone voice no more than a 
dozen feet from me. I look for 
likely owners of that voice. Men 
all around. You? You? You? No 
way of telling. Yes, one way. When 
words are spoken aloud, they 
reverberate in the mind of the 
speaker for a short while. (Also 
in the minds of his hearers, but the 
reverberations are different in 
tonality.) I summon my slippery 
skill and, straining, force needles 
of inquiry into the nearby con- 
sciousnessness, hunting for echoes. 
The effort is murderously great. 
The skulls I enter are solid bony 
domes through whose few crevices 
1 struggle to ram my limp, feeble 
probes. But I enter. I seek the 
proper reverberations. Tom Ny- 
quist? Tom Nyquist? Who spoke 
his name? You? You? Ah. There. 
The echo is almost gone, just a dim 
hollow clangor at the far end of a 
cavern. A tall plump man with a 
comic fringe of blond beard. 

“Excuse me,” I say. “I didn’t 
mean to eavesdrop, but I heard 
you mention the name of a very old 
friend of mine — ” 

“Oh?” 

“ — and 1 couldn’t help coming 
over to ask you about him. Tom 
Nyquist. He and I were once very 
close. If you know where he is 
now, what he’s doing — ” 

“Tom Nyquist?” 

“Yes. I’m sure I heard you 
mention him.” 

A blank smile. “I’m afraid 
there’s been a mistake. I don’t 



130 



GALAXY 




know anyone by that name. Jim? 
Fred? Can you help?” 

“But I’m positive I heard — ” 
The echo. Bourn in the cave. Was 
1 mistaken? At close range I try to 
get inside his head, to hunt in his 
filing system for any knowledge of 
Nyquist. But I can’t function at 
all, now. They are conferring 
earnestly. Nyquist? Nyquist? Did 
anybody, hear a Nyquist men- 
tioned? Does anyone know a 
Nyquist? 

One of them suddenly cries, 
“John Leibnitz!” 

“Yes,” says the plump one hap- 
pily. “Maybe that’s whom you 
heard me mention. I was talking 
about John Leibnitz a few mo- 
ments ago. A mutual friend. In 
this racket that might very well 
have sounded Nyquist to you.” 
Leibnitz. Nyquist. Leibnitz. Ny- 
quist. Bourn. Bourn. “Quite pos- 
sibly,” I agree. “No doubt that’s 
what happened. Silly of me.” 
John Leibnitz. “Sorry to have 
bothered you.” 

G UERMANTES says, mincing 
and prancing at my elbow, 
“You really must audit my class 
one of these days. This Wednesday 
afternoon I start Rimbaud and 
Verlaine. Do come around. You’ll 
be on campus Wednesday, won’t 
you?” 

Wednesday is the day I must 
deliver Yahya Lumumba’s term 
paper on the Greek tragedians. I’ll 
be on campus, yes. I’d better be. 



But how does Guermantes know 
that? Is he getting into my head 
somehow? What if he has the 
gift, too? And I’m wide open to 
him, he knows everything, my poor 
pathetic secret, my daily incre- 
ment of loss and there he stands, 
patronizing me because I’m failing 
and he’s as sharp as I ever was? 
Then a quick paranoiac flash — not 
only does he have the gift but per- 
haps he’s some kind of telepathic 
leech, draining me, bleeding the 
power right out of my mind and 
into his. Perhaps he’s been tapping 
me on the sly ever since ’74. 

I shake these useless idiocies 
away. “I expect to be around on 
Wednesday. Maybe I’ll drop in.” 
There is no chance whatever that 
I will go to hear Claude Guer- 
mantes lecture on Rimbaud or 
Verlaine. If he’s got the power, let 
him put that in his pipe and smoke 
it. 

“I’d love it if you came,” he tells 
me. He leans close to me. I smell 
hair tonic, shaving lotion, deo- 
dorant and other perfumes. A 
small blessing — not all my senses 
are dwindling at once. “Your 
sister,” he murmurs. “Marvelous 
woman. How I love her! She speaks 
often of you.” 

“Does she?” 

“With great love. Also with great 
guilt. It seems you and she were 
estranged for many years.” 

“That’s over now. We’re finally 
becoming friends.” 

“How wonderful for you both.”

He gestures with a flick of his eyes. 
“That doctor. No good for her. 
Too old, too static. After fifty, 
most men lose the capacity to 
grow. He’ll bore her to death in six 
months.” 

“Maybe boredom is what she 
needs,” I reply. “She’s had an ex- 
citing life. It hasn’t made her 
happy.” 

“No one ever needs boredom,” 
Guermantes says and winks. 

ii ARL and I would love to 
,^^have you come for dinner 
next week, Duv. There’s so much 
we three need to talk about.” 

“I’ll see, Jude. I’m not sure 
about anything about next week 
yet. I’ll call you.” 

Lisa Holstein. John Leibnitz. I 
think I need another drink. 

S UNDAY. Greatly overhung. 

Hash, rum, wine, pot — God 
knows what else. And somebody 
popping amyl nitrite under my nose 
about two in the morning. That 
filthy party. I should never have 
gone. My head, my head, my head. 
Where’s the typewriter? I’ve got 
to get some work done. Let’s go, 
then: 

We see, thus, the difference 
in the method of approach of 
these three tragedians to the 
same story. Aeschylus’ primary 
concern is theological impli- 
cations of the crime and the 
inexorable workings of the 



gods: Orestes is torn between 
the command of Apollo to 
slay his mother and his own 
fear of matricide, and he goes 
mad as a result. Euripides 
dwells on the characterization, 
and takes a less allegorical 

No damned good. Save it for 
later. 

Silence between my ears. The 
echoing black void. I have nothing 
going for me at all today, nothing. 
I think it may be completely gone. 
I can’t even pick up the clamor of 
the spies next door. November is 
the cruelest month, breeding onions 
out of the dead mind. I’m living an 
Eliot poem. I’m turning into words 
on a page. Shall I sit here feeling 
sorry for myself? No. No. No. No. 
I’ll fight back. Spiritual exercises 
designed to restore my power. On 
your knees, Selig. Bow the head. 
Concentrate. Transform yourself 
into a fine needle of thought, a 
slim telepathic laser beam, stretch- 
ing from this room to the vicinity 
of the lovely star, Betelgeuse. Got 
it? Good. That sharp pure mental 
beam piercing the universe. Hold 
it. Hold it firm. No spreading at 
the edges allowed, man. Good. 
Now ascend. We are climbing 
Jacob’s ladder. This will be an 
out-of-the-body experience, Duvid. 
Up, up and away! Rise through the 
ceiling, through the roof, through 
the atmosphere, through the iono- 
sphere, through the stratosphere, 
through the whatsisphere. Out-

No, stop that stuff! Only positive

Well? 

Nothing. Nada. Niente. No-

up, if that’s what you want. All 
right. Rest for a little while. Rest 
and then pray, Selig. Pray. 

M onday. The hangover is 
gone. The brain is once again 
receptive. In a glorious burst of 
creative frenzy I rewrite The 
“Electra” Theme in Aeschylus, 
Sophocles and Euripides from gun- 
wale to fetlock, completely re- 
casting it, revoicing it, clarifying 
and strengthening the ideas while 
simultaneously catching what I 
think is just the perfect tone of 
offhand black hipness. As I 
hammer out the final words the 
telephone rings. Lisa Holstein. 
“You promised to take me home 
after the party,’’ she says mourn- 
fully, accusingly. “What the hell 
did you do, sneak away?” 

“How did you get my number?” 
“From Claude. Professor Guer- 
mantes.” That sleek devil. He 



knows everything. “Look, what 
are you doing right now?” 
“Thinking about having a shower. 
I’ve been working all morning and 
I stink like a goat.” 

“What kind of work do you do?” 
“I ghostwrite term papers for 
Columbia men.” 

She ponders that a moment. 
“You sure have a weird head, man. 
1 mean really — what do you do?” 

“I Just told you.” 

A long digestive silence. Then; 
“Okay. I can dig it. You ghost- 
write term papers. Look, Dave, go 
take your shower. How long is it 
on the subway from a hundred and 
tenth and Broadway to your 
place?” 

“Maybe forty minutes if you get 
a train right away.” 

“Swell. See you in an hour, 
then.” Click. 

1 shrug. A crazy broad. Dave, 
she calls me. Nobody calls me 
Dave. Stripping, I head for the 
shower, a long leisurely soaping. 
Then I pick up the Updike book. 
I get to page four and the phone 
rings again. Lisa: she’s on the train 
platform at 225th, wants to know 
how to get to my apartment. This 
is more than a joke now. But okay. 
I can play her game. 1 give her the 
instructions. 

Ten minutes later, a knock on the 
door. Lisa in thick black sweater, 
the same sweaty one as Saturday 
night, and tight blue jeans. A shy 
grin, strangely out of character for 
her. “Hi,” she says. Making herself

comfortable. “When I first saw you 
I had this intuitive flash on you: 
This guy’s got something special. 
Make it with him. If there’s one 
thing I’ve learned, it’s that you’ve 
got to trust your intuition. I go 
with the flow, Dave, I go with the 
flow.’’ Her sweater is off by now. 
Her breasts are heavy and round, 
with tiny, almost imperceptible 
nipples. A Jewish star nestles in 
the deep valley between them. She 
wanders the room, examining my 
books, my records, my photo- 
graphs. “So tell me,” she says. 
“Now that I’m here. Was I right? 
Is there anything special about 
you?” 

“There once was.” 

“What?” 

“That’s for me to know and you 
to find out,” I say and, gathering 
my strength, I ram my mind into 
hers. It’s a brutal frontal assault, 
a rape. Of course, she doesn’t feel 
a thing. I say, “I used to have a 
really extraordinary gift. It’s 
mostly worn off by now, but some 
of the time I still have it and, as a 
matter of fact. I’m using it on you 
right now.” 

“Far out,” she says and drops 
her jeans. No underpants. She will 
be fat before she’s thirty. Her 
thighs are thick, her belly pro- 
trudes. While 1 inspect her flesh 
I savagely ransack her mind, 
sparing her no areas of privacy, 
enjoying my access while it lasts. 
I don’t need to be polite. I owe her 
nothing — she forced herself on me. 



I check first to see if she had been 
lying when she said she’d never 
heard of Kitty. The truth: Kitty is 
no kin to her. A meaningless coin- 
cidence of surnames, is all. 

“I’m sure you’re a poet, Dave,” 
she says as we entwine and drop 
onto the unmade bed. “That’s an 
intuition flash too. Even if you’re 
doing this term paper thing now, 
poetry is where you’re really at.” 

1 continue to loot her mind like 
a Goth plundering the Forum. She 
is fully open to me — 1 delight in 
this unexpected return of vigor. 
Her autobiography assembles itself 
for me. Born in Cambridge. Twenty 
years old. Father a professor. One 
younger brother. Tomboy child- 
hood. Measles, chicken pox, scar- 
let fever. Puberty at eleven, lost 
her virginity at twelve. Abortion 
at sixteen. Several Lesbian ad- 
ventures. Passionate interest in 
French decadent poets. Acid, mes- 
calin, psilocybin, cocaine, even a 
sniff of smack. Guermantes gave 
her that. Guermantes also took 
her to bed five or six times. Vivid 
memories of that. Her mind shows 
me more of Guermantes than 1 
want to see. Lisa comes through 
with a tough, aggressive self-image, 
captain of her soul, master of her 
fate, and so forth. Underneath that 
it’s just the opposite, of course; 
she’s scared as hell. Not a bad kid. 
I feel a little guilty about the casual 
way 1 slammed into her head, no 
regard for her privacy at all. But I 
have my needs.

i lie there picking her brain and 
accepting the gift of her lips. Co- 
vertly I feed on feedback, tapping 
into her pleasure-responses. But 
then a funny thing happens. The 
broadcast from her mind is be- 
coming erratic and indistinct, more 
noise than signal. The images break 
up in a pounding of static. What 
gets through is garbled and 
distant — I scramble to maintain my 
hold on her consciousness, but no 
use, no use, she slips away, moment 
by moment receding from me, until 
there is no communion at all. 

She is caught by surprise. “What 
brought you down?” she asks. 

I find it impossible to tell her. I 
remember Judith asking me, some 
weeks back, whether I had ever 
regarded my loss of mental powers 
as a kind of metaphor of impo- 
tence. And now here, for the first 
time, metaphor blends with reality 
— the two failures are integrated. 
He is impotent here and he is im- 
potent there. Poor David. 

“I guess I got distracted,” I tell 
her. “Let’s just rest and maybe 
I’ll come back to life.” 

We rest. Side by side, stroking 
her skin in an abstract way, I run 
a few tentative probing efforts. 
Not a flicker on the telepathic 
level. Not a flicker. The silence of 
the tomb. Is this it, the end, right 
here and now? Is this where it 
finally burns out? And I am like all 
the rest of you now. I am con- 
demned to make do with mere 
words. 



I try again to probe her. Zero. 
Zee-ro. Is it gone? I think it’s really 
gone. You have been present today 
at an historic event, young lady. 
The perishing of a remarkable 
extrasensory power. Leaving be- 
hind this merely mortal husk of 
mine. Alas. 

“I’d love to read some of your 
poetry, Dave,” she says. 

M onday night, about seven- 
thirty. Lisa has left, finally. 
I go out for dinner to a nearby 
pizzeria. I am quite calm. The 
impact of what has befallen me 
hasn’t really registered yet. How 
strange that I can be so accepting. 
At any moment, 1 know, it’s bound 
to come rushing in on me, crushing 
me, shattering me. But for now I’m 
surprisingly cool. An oddly post- 
humous feeling, as of having out- 
lived myself. And a feeling of 
relief — the suspense is over, the 
process has completed itself. The 
dying is done and I’ve survived it. 
Of course I don’t expect this mood 
to last. I’ve lost something central 
to my being and now I await the 
anguish and the grief and the 
despair that must surely be due to 
erupt shortly. 

But it seems that my mourning 
must be postpbned. What I thought 
was all over isn’t over yet. I walk 
into the pizzeria and the counter- 
man gives me his flatly cold New 
York smile of welcome. And I get 
this, unsolicited, from behind his 
greasy face;

Hey, here's the fag who always 
wants extra anchovies. 

Reading him clearly. So it’s not 
dead yet! Not quite dead! Only 
resting a while. Only hiding. 

T uesday. Bitter cold, one of 
those terrible late-autumn days 
when every drop of moisture has 
been squeezed from the air and the 
sunlight is like knives. I finish 
two more term papers. Judith calls 
after lunch. The usual dinner 
invitation. My usual oblique reply. 

“What did you think of Karl?” 
she asks. 

“A very substantial man.” 

“He wants me to marry him.” 
“Well?” 

“It’s too soon. 1 don’t really 
know him, Duv. I like him — 1 
admire him tremendously, but 1 
don’t know whether I love him.” 
“Then don’t rush into anything 
with him,” I say. “Besides, if you 
marry him, he’d probably want you 
to give up Guermantes. I don’t 
think he could dig it.” 

“You know about me and 
Claude?” 

“Of course.” 

“You always know everything.” 
“This was pretty obvious, Jude.” 
“I thought your power was 
waning.” 

“It is, it is — faster than ever. But 
this was still pretty obvious. To the 
naked eye.” 

“All right. What did you think of 
him?” 

“He’s death. He’s a killer.” 



“You misjudge him, Duv.” 

“I was in his head. I saw him, 
Jude. He isn’t human. People are 
toys to him.” 

“If you could hear the sound of 
your own voice now, Duv. The 
hostility, the outright Jealousy — ” 
“Jealousy? Am I so openly 
incestuous?” 

“You always were,” she says. 
“But let that pass. I really thought 
you’d enjoy meeting Claude.” 

“I did. He’s fascinating. 1 think 
cobras are fascinating too.” 

“Oh, shove it, Duv.” 

“You want me to pretend 1 liked 
him?” 

“Don’t do me any favors.” The 
old icy Judith. 

“What’s Karl’s reaction to 
Guermantes?” 

She pauses. Finally: “Pretty 

negative. Karl’s very conventional, 
you know. Just as you are.” 

“Me?” 

“Oh, you’re so damned straight, 
Duv! You’re such a puritan! You’ve 
been lecturing me on morality all 
my goddamned life, wagging your 
finger at me — ” 

“Why doesn’t Karl like him?” 

“I don’t know. He thinks 
Claude’s sinister. Exploitive.” Her 
voice is suddenly flat and dull. 
“Maybe he’s just jealous. He knows 
I’m still sleeping with Claude. Oh, 
Jesus, Duv, why are we fighting 
again? Why can’t we just talk!" 

“I’m not the one who’s fighting. 
I’m not the one who raised his 
voice.”

“You’re challenging me. That’s 
what you always do. You spy on 
me and then you challenge me and 
try to put me down.” 

“Old habits are hard to break, 
Jude. Really, though — I’m not 
angry with you.” 

“You sound so smug!” 

“I’m not angry. You are. You 
got angry when you saw that Karl 
and 1 agree about your friend 
Claude. People always get angry 
when they’re told something they 
don’t want to hear. Listen, Jude, 
do whatever you want. If Guer- 
mantes is your trip, go ahead.” 

“I don’t know. I just don’t 
know.” An unexpected concession: 
“Maybe there is something sick 
about my relationship with him.” 
Her flinty self-assurance vanishes 
abruptly. That’s the wonderful 
thing about her— you get a different 
Judith every two minutes. Now, 
softening, thawing, she sounds 
uncertain of herself. In a moment 
she’ll turn her concern outward, 
away from her own troubles, 
toward me. “Will you come to 
dinner next week? We very much 
do want to get together with you.” 
“I’ll try.” 

“I’m worried about you, Duv.” 
Yes, here it comes. “You looked 
so strung out on Saturday night.” 
“It’s been a pretty rough time for 
me. But I’ll manage.” I don’t feel 
like talking about myself. “Listen, 
I’ll call you soon, okay?” 

“Are you still in so much pain, 
Duv?” 



“I’m adapting. I’m accepting the 
whole thing. I mean. I’ll be okay. 
Keep in touch, Jude. My best to 
Karl.” And Claude, I add, as I put 
down the receiver. 

EDNESDAY morning. 
Downtown to deliver my 
latest batch of masterpieces. It’s 
colder even than yesterday. The 
air is clearer, the sun brighter, more 
remote. How dry the world seems. 
The humidity must be practically 
zero, I think. This is the sort of 
weather I used to function in with 
overwhelming clarity of perception. 
But I was picking up hardly any- 
thing at all on the subway ride 
down to Columbia, just muzzy 
little blurts and squeaks, nothing 
coherent. 1 can no longer be certain 
of having the power on any given 
day, apparently, and this is one of 
the days off. Unpredictable. That’s 
what you are, you who live in my 
head — unpredictable. Thrashing 
about randomly in your death 
throes. 

I go to the usual place and await 
my clients. They come. They get 
from me what they have come for. 
They cross my palm with green- 
backs. David Selig, benefactor of 
undergraduate mankind. I see 
Yahya Lumumba like a black 
sequoia making his way across 
from Butler Library. Why am I 
trembling? It’s the chill in the air, 
isn’t it, the hint of winter, the 
death of the year? 

“You got the paper, man?”

“Right here.” I deal it off the 
stack. “Aeschylus, Sophocles, 
Euripides. Six pages. That’s twenty- 
one dollars, minus the five you 
already gave me — makes sixteen 
you owe me.” 

“Wait, man.” He sits down 
beside me on the steps. “I got to 
read it first, right?” 

I watch him as he reads. Some- 
how I expect him to be moving his 
lips, to be stumbling over the un- 
familiar words, but no — his eyes 
flicker rapidly over the lines. He 
gnaws his lip. He reads faster and 
faster, impatiently turning the 
pages. At length he looks at me 
and there is death in his eyes. 

“This is shit, man,” he says. “I 
mean, this here is just shit. What 
kind of con you trying to pull?” 

“1 guarantee you’ll get a B-f-. 
You don’t have to pay me until 
you get the grade. Anything less 
than B-l- and — ” 

“No, listen to me. Who talking 
about grades? I can’t turn this thing 
in at all. Look, half this thing is 
jive-talk, the other half is copied 
straight out some book. Crazy shit, 
that’s what. The prof is going to 
read it, he going to look at me, he 
going to say, Lumumba, who you 
think I am? You think I a dummy, 
Lumumba? You didn’t write this 
crap, he going to say to me. You 
don’t believe Word One of this.” 
Angrily he rises. “Here, I going 
to read you some of this, man. 1 
show you what you give me.” 
Leafing through the pages, he 



scowls, spits, shakes his head. “No. 
Why the hell should 1? You know 
what you up to here, man? You 
making fun of me, that’s what. 
You playing games with the dumb 
nigger, man.” 

“1 was trying to make it look 
plausible that you had written — ” 

“Crap. You pulling a mindfuck, 
man. You making up a pile of 
stinking Jew shit about Europydes 
and you hoping I get in trouble 
trying to pass it off as my own 
stuff.” 

“That’s a lie. I did the best pos- 
sible job for you — and don’t think 
1 didn’t sweat plenty. When you 
hire another man to write a term 
paper for you I think you have to 
be prepared to expect a certain — ” 

“How long this take you? Fifteen 
minutes?” 

“Eight hours, maybe ten,” I say. 
“You know what 1 think you’re 
trying to do, Lumumba? You’re 
pulling reverse racism on me. Jew 
this and Jew that — if you don’t 
like Jews so much, why didn’t you 
get a black to write your paper for 
you? Why didn’t you write it your- 
self? I did an honest job for you. 
I don’t like hearing it put down as 
stinking Jew shit. And I tell you 
that if you turn it in, you’ll get a 
passing grade for sure — you’ll 
probably get a B-f- at the very 
least.” 

“I gonna get flunked, is what.” 

“No. No. Maybe you just don’t 
see what 1 was driving at. Let me 
try to explain it to you. If you’ll

give it to me for a minute so I can 
read you a couple of things — maybe 
it’ll be clearer if I — ” Getting to my 
feet, I extend a hand toward the 
paper, but he grins and holds it 
high above my head. I’d need a 
ladder to reach it. “Come on, damn 
it, don’t play games with me! Let 
me have it!’’ I snap. He flicks his 
wrist and the six sheets of paper 
soar into the wind and go sailing 
eastward. Dying, I watch them go. 
1 clench my fists — an astonishing 
burst of rage explodes in me. I 
want to smash in his mocking face. 
“You shouldn’t have done that,” 
1 say. “You shouldn’t have just 
thrown it away.” 

“You owe me my five bucks.” 
“Hold on, now. I did the work 
you hired me to do and — ” 

“You said you don’t charge if 
the paper’s no good. Okay, the 
paper was shit. No charge. Give 
me the five.” 

“You aren’t playing fair, Lu- 
mumba. You’re trying to rip me 
off.” 

“Who ripping who off? Who set 
up that money-back deal anyhow? 
Me? You. What I gonna do for a 
term paper now? I got to take an 
incomplete and it your fault. Sup- 
pose they make me ineligible for 
the team because of that. Huh? 
Huh? What then? Look, man, you 
make me want to puke. Give me 
the five.” 

I S HE serious about the refund? 
I can’t tell. The idea of paying 



him back disgusts me and it isn’t 
just on account of losing the money. 
I wish I could read him, but I can’t 
get anything out of him on that 
level — I’m completely blocked 
now. I’ll bluff. I say, “What is this, 
slavery turned upside down? 1 did 
the work. 1 don’t give a damn what 
kind of crazy irrational reasons 
you’ve got for rejecting it. I’m 
going to keep the five. At least 
the five.” 

“Give me the money, man.” 

“Go to hell.” 

I start to walk away. He grabs 
me — his arm, fully extended toward 
me, must be as long as one of my 
legs — and hauls me to him. He 
starts to shake me. My teeth are 
rattling. His grin is broader than 
ever, but his eyes are demonic. 
I wave my fists at him, but, held 
at arm’s length, I can’t even 
touch him. 1 start to yell. A crowd 
is gathering. Suddenly there are 
three or four other men in varsity 
jackets surrounding us, all black, 
all gigantic, though not as big as 
he is. His teammates. Laughing, 
whooping, cavorting. I am a toy 
to them. “Hey, man, he bothering 
you?” one of them asks. “You 
need help, Yahya?” yells another. 
“What’s the honkie doing to you, 
man?” calls a third. They form 
a ring and Lumumba thrusts me 
toward the man on his left, who 
catches me and flings me onward 
around the circle. I spin — I stumble 
— I reel. They never let me fall. 
Around and around and around.

An elbow explodes against my lip. 
1 taste blood. Someone slaps me 
and my head rockets backward. 
Fingers are jabbing my ribs. I 
realize that I’m going to get very 
badly hurt, that in fact these giants 
are going to beat me up. A voice 
I barely recognize as my own 
offers Lumumba his refund, but 
no one notices. They continue to 
whirl me from one to the next. 
Not slapping now, not jabbing, 
but punching. Where are the cam- 
pus police? Help! Help! Pigs to 
the rescue! But no one comes. 1 
can’t catch my breath. I’d like to 
drop to my knees and huddle 
against the ground. They’re yelling 
at me, racial epithets, words 1 
barely comprehend, soul-brother 
jargon that must have been in- 
vented last week. I don’t know 
what they’re calling me, but I 
can feel the hatred in every syl- 
lable. Help? Help? The world spins 
wildly. I know now how a basket- 
ball would feel, if a basketball 
could feel. The steady pounding, 
the blur of unending motion. 
Please, someone, anyone, help me, 
stop them. Pain in my chest — a 
lump of white-hot metal back of my 
breastbone. I can’t see. I can only 
feel. Where are my feet? I’m fall- 
ing at last. Look how fast the steps 
rush toward me. The cold kiss 
of the stone bruises my cheek. I 
may already have lost conscious- 
ness — how can I tell? There’s one 
comfort at least. I can’t get any 
further down than this. 



XX 

H e was ready to fall in love 
when he met Kitty, overripe 
and eager for an emotional en- 
tanglement. Perhaps that was the 
whole trouble — what he felt for 
her was not so much love as simply 
satisfaction at the idea of being 
in love. Or perhaps not. He never 
understood his feelings for Kitty 
in any orderly way. They had 
their romance in the summer of 
1963, which he remembers as the 
last summer of hope and good 
cheer before the long autumn of 
entropic chaos and philosophical 
despair descended on western 
society. 

Selig, who was twenty-eight 
years old, had just moved from 
his Brooklyn Heights apartment 
to a small place in the West Seven- 
ties. He was working as a stock- 
broker then, of all unlikely things. 
This was Tom Nyquist’s idea. 
After six years, Nyquist was still 
his closest and possibly only friend, 
although the friendship had waned 
considerably in the last year or two. 
One day Selig had said wistfully 
that if he could only manage to get 
a bundle of money together — say, 
twenty-five thousand dollars or 
so — he would go off to a remote 
island and spend a couple of years 
writing a novel, a major statement 
about alienation in contemporary 
life, something like that. He had 
never written anything serious and 
wasn’t sure he was sincere about 



140 



GALAXY 




wanting to. He was secretly hoping 
that Nyquist would simply hand 
him the money — Nyquist could 
pick up twenty-five thousand dol- 
lars in one afternoon’s work, if he 
felt like it — and say, “Here, chum, 
go and be creative.” But Nyquist 
didn’t do things that way. Instead 
he said that the easiest way for 
someone without capital to make a 
lot of money in a hurry was to take 
a job as a customer’s man with a 
brokerage firm. The commissions 
would be decent, enough to live on 
and something left over, but the 
real money would come from riding 
along on all the in-shop maneuvers 
of the experienced brokers — the 
short sales, the new-issue pur- 
chases, the arbitrage ploys. If 
you’re dedicated enough, Nyquist 
told him, you can make just about 
as much as you like. Selig protested 
that he knew nothing about Wall 
Street. 

“I could teach you everything 
in three days,” said Nyquist. 

The lesson actually took less 
time. Selig slipped into Nyquist’s 
mind for a quick cram course in 
financial terminology. Nyquist had 
all the definitions beautif^ully ar- 
ranged — common stocks and pre- 
ferred, shorts and longs, puts and 
calls, debentures, convertibles, 
capital gains, special situations, 
closed-end versus open-end funds, 
secondary offerings, specialists and 
what they do, the over-the-counter 
market, the Dow-Jones averages, 
point-and-figure charts and every- 



thing else. Selig memorized all of 
it. There was a vivid quality about 
mind-to-mind transferences with 
Nyquist that made memorizing 
things easy. 

The next step was to enroll as a 
trainee. Every big brokerage firm 
was looking for beginners. Selig 
picked one at random and applied. 
They gave him a stock-market quiz 
by way of preliminary screening. 
He knew most of the answers and 
those he didn’t know he picked up 
out of the minds of his fellow 
testees, most of whom had been 
following the market since child- 
hood. He got a perfect score and 
was hired. After a brief training 
period he passed the licensing test 
and before long he was a registered 
representative operating out of a 
fairly new brokerage office on 
Broadway near 72nd Street. 

He was one of five brokers, all of 
them fairly young. The clientele 
was predominantly Jewish and 
generally geriatric: seventy-five- 

year-old widows from the huge 
apartment houses along 72nd 
Street and cigar-chomping retired 
garment manufacturers who lived 
on West End Avenue and Riverside 
Drive. Since most of the clients 
were elderly and didn’t work, the 
bulk of dealings at the office were 
transacted in person rather than 
by phone. There were always ten or 
twelve senior citizens schmoozing 
in front of the stock ticker and now 
and then one of them would dodder 
to the desk of his pet broker and

place an order. Selig quickly 
became a favorite, especially 
among the old ladies; they liked 
him because he was a nice Jewish 
boy, and several offered to intro- 
duce him to comely granddaughters. 

Business was steady but unspec- 
tacular. Once. he had acquired his 
own nucleus of regulars, Selig’s 
commissions ran to about a hun- 
dred and sixty a week. This was 
more money than he had ever made 
before, but hardly the kind of 
income he imagined brokers pulled 
down. “You’re lucky you came 
here in the spring,” one of the other 
customer’s men told him. “In the 
winter months all the clients go to 
Florida and we can choke before 
anybody gives us any business 
here.” 

As Nyquist had predicted, he was 
able to turn some pleasant profits 
by trading for his own account; 
there were always nice little deals 
circulating in the office, hot tips 
with substance behind them. He 
started with savings of three hun- 
dred fifty dollars and quickly pyra- 
mided his wad to a high four-figure 
sum. But he discovered that Wall 
Street runs in two directions and 
much of his winnings melted away 
through badly timed trades. He 
came to see that he was never going 
to have enough of a stake to go off 
and write that novel. 

1 UCK delivered Kitty to him. 

< She came in one muggy July 
morning at half-past nine. The 



market had not yet opened. Many 
of the customers had fled to the 
Catskills for the summer and the 
only people in the office were Mar- 
tinson, the manager, Nadel, one of 
the other customer’s men, and 
Selig. 

Selig, idle, was daydreaming 
of falling in love with somebody’s 
beautiful granddaughter. Then 
the door opened and somebody’s 
beautiful granddaughter came in. 
Not exactly beautiful, maybe, but 
certainly attractive — a girl in her 
early twenties, slim and well pro- 
portioned, perhaps five feet three 
or four, with fluffy light-brown 
hair, blue-green eyes, finely out- 
lined features, a graceful slender 
figure. 

She seemed shy, intelligent, 
somehow innocent, a curious mix- 
ture of knowledge and naivete'. She 
wore a white silk blouse — gold 
chain lying on the smallish breasts 
— and an ankle-length brown skirt, 
offering a hint of excellent legs 
beneath. No, not a beautiful girl, 
but certainly pretty. What the hell, 
Selig wondered, does she want in 
this temple of Mammon at her age? 
She’s here fifty years too early. 
Curiosity led him to send a probe 
drilling into her forehead as she 
walked toward him. Seeking only 
surface stuff: name, age, marital 
status, address, telephone number, 
purpose of visit — what else? 

He got nothing. 

That shocked him. It was an 
incredible experience, unique. To 



142 



GALAXY 




reach toward a mind and find it 
absolutely inaccessible, opaque, 
hidden as if behind an impenetrable 
wall — he had never had that happen 
to him before. He got no aura from 
her at all. She might as well have 
been a department store’s plaster 
window mannequin or a mindless 
robot from another planet. He sat 
there blinking, trying to account 
for his failure to make contact. He 
was so astounded by her total 
blankness that he forgot to listen 
to what she was saying to him. He 
had to ask her to repeat. 

“I said. I’d like to open a bro- 
kerage account. Are you a broker?” 

Sheepish, fumbling, stricken with 
sudden adolescent clumsiness, he 
gave her the new-account forms. 
Sitting beside his cluttered desk, 
she told him of her investment 
needs while he studied the elegant 
structure of her high-bridged nose, 
fought without success against her 
perplexing and enigmatic mental 
inaccessibility and, despite or 
perhaps because of that inaccess- 
ibility, felt himself helplessly falling 
in love with her. 

She was twenty-two, one year out 
of Radcliffe, came from Long 
Island and shared a West End 
Avenue apartment with two other 
girls. Unmarried — there had been 
a long futile love affair ending in 
a broken engagement not long 
before, he would discover later. 
(How strange it was for him not to 
be discovering everything at once, 
taking the information as he 



desired it.) Her background was in 
mathematics and she worked as a 
computer programer, a term which, 
in 1963, meant very little to him. 
He wasn’t sure whether she 
designed computers, operated them 
or repaired them. Recently she 
had inherited sixty-five hundred 
dollars from an aunt in Arizona, 
and her parents, who evidently were 
stern and formidable advocates of 
sink-or-swim education, had told 
her to invest the money on her own, 
by way of assuming adult respon- 
sibilities. So she had gone to her 
friendly neighborhood brokerage 
office, a lamb for the shearing, to 
invest her money. “What do you 
want?” Selig asked her. “To stash 
it away in safe blue chips, or to go 
for a little action, a chance for 
capital gains?” 

“1 don’t know. 1 don’t know the 
first thing about the market. I just 
don’t want to do anything silly.” 

Another broker — Nadel, say — 
would have given her the Nothing 
Ventured, Nothing Gained speech 
and, advising her to forget about 
such old and tired concepts as 
dividends, would have steered her 
into an action portfolio — Texas 
Instruments, Collips Radio, Pola- 
roid, stuff like that. Then he would 
churn her account every few monts, 
switch Polaroid into Xerox, Texas 
Instruments into Fairchild Camera, 
Collins into American Motors, 
American Motors back into Pola- 
roid, running up fancy commissions 
for himself and, perhaps, making 



DYING INSIDE 



143 




some money for her. Or perhaps 
losing some. Selig had no stomach 
for such maneuvers. 

“This is going to sound stodgy,” 
he said, “but let’s play it very safe. 
I’ll recommend some decent things 
that won’t ever make you rich but 
that you won’t get hurt on, either. 
And then you can just put them 
away and watch them grow, with- 
out having to check the market 
quotations every day to find out if 
you ought to sell. Because you 
don’t really want to bother worry- 
ing about the short-term fluctu- 
ations, do you?” This was 
absolutely not what Martinson 
had instructed him to tell new 
clients, but to hell with that. 

She smiled. It was a shy, half- 
forced smile, but he thought he 
detected flirtatiousness in her 
eyes. It was agony for him not to 
be able to read her, to be compelled 
to depend on external signals alone 
in order to know where he stood 
with her. But he took the chance. 

“What are you doing this even- 
ing?” he asked. “I get out of here 
at four o’clock.” 

She was free, she said. Except 
that she worked from eleven to 
six. He arranged to pick her up at 
her apartment around seven. There 
was no mistaking the warmth of her 
smile as she left the office. “You 
lucky bastard,” Nadel said. 
“What did you do, make a date 
with her? It violates the SEC rules 
for customer’s men to go around 
laying the customers.” 



S ELIG only laughed. Twenty 
minutes after the market 
opened he shorted two hundred 
Molybdenum on the Amex and 
covered his sale a point and a 
half lower at lunchtime. That 
ought to take care of the cost of 
dinner, he figured, with some to 
spare. Nyquist had given him the 
tip yesterday. During the mid- 
afternoon lull, he phoned Nyquist 
to report on his maneuver. “You 
covered too soon,” Nyquist said 
immediately. “She’ll drop five or 
six more points this week. The 
smart money’s waiting for that.” 
“I’m not that greedy. I’ll settle 
for the quick three bills.” 

“That’s no way to get rich.” 

“I guess I lack gambling 
instinct,” Selig said. He hesitated. 
He hadn’t really called Nyquist 
to talk about shorting Molybde- 
num. I met a girl, he wanted to say, 
and I have this funny problem with 
her. I met a girl, I met a girl. 
Sudden fears held him back. 
Nyquist’s silent passive presence 
at the other end of the telephone 
line seemed somehow threatening. 
He’ll laugh at me, Selig thought. 
He’s always laughing at me, 
quietly, thinking I don’t see it. 
But this is foolishness. He said, 
“Tom, something strange happened 
today. A girl came into the office, 
a very attractive girl. I’m seeing 
her tonight.” 

“Congratulations.” 

“Wait. The thing is, I was 
entirely unable to read her. I mean. 



144 



GALAXY 




I couldn’t even pick up an aura. 
Blank, absolutely blank. I've never 
had that with anybody before. Have 
you?” 

“I don’t think so.” 

“A complete blank. 1 can’t 
understand it. What could ac- 
count for her having such a strong 
screen?” 

“Maybe you’re tired today,” 
Nyquist suggested. 

“No. No. 1 can read everybody 
else, same as always. Just not 
her.” 

“Does that irritate you?” 

“Of course it does.” 

“Why do you say of course?” 

The reason seemed obvious to 
Selig. He could tell that Nyquist 
was baiting him — the voice calm, 
uninflected, neutral. A game. A 
way of passing time. He wished 
he hadn’t phoned. 

Brusquely Selig said, “I’m — 
well, very interested in her. And it 
bothers me that I have no way of 
getting through to her real self.” 
Nyquist said, “You mean you’re 
annoyed that you can’t spy on her.” 
“1 don’t like that phrase.” 
“Whose phrase is it? Not mine. 
That’s how you regard what we do, 
isn’t it? As spying. You feel quilty 
about spying on people, right? 
But it seems you also feel upset 
when you can’t spy.” 

“1 suppose,” Selig admitted sul- 
lenly. 

“With this girl you find yourself 
forced back on the same old 
clumsy guesswork techniques for 



dealing with people that the rest 
of the world is condemned to use 
all the time — and you don’t like 
that. Yes?” 

“You make it sound evil, Tom.” 
“What do you want me to say?” 
“I don’t want you to say any- 
thing. I’m just telling you that 
there’s this girl I can’t read, that 
I’ve never been up against this 
situation before, that I wonder if 
you have any theories to account 
for why she’s the way she is.” 

“I don’t,” Nyquist said. “Not 
off the top of my head.” 

“All right, then. 1 — ” 

But Nyquist wasn’t finished. 
“You realize that I have no way 
of telling whether she’s opaque to 
the telepathic process in general 
or just opaque to you, David.” 
That possibility had occurred to 
Selig a moment earlier. He 
found it deeply disturbing. 
Nyquist went on smoothly, 
“Suppose you bring her around 
one of these days and let me take 
a look at her. Maybe I’ll be able to 
learn something useful about her 
that way.” 

“I’ll do that,” Selig said without 
enthusiasm. He knew such a 
meeting was necessary and in- 
evitable, but the idea of exposing 
Kitty to Nyquist produced 
agitation in him. “One of these 
days soon,” he said. “Look, all 
the phones are lighting up. I’ll 
be in touch, Tom.” 

“Give her one for me,” said 
Nyquist.

Selig Studies 101, Prof. Selig 
November 10, 1976 

ENTROPY AS A FACTOR IN 
EVERYDAY LIFE 

Entropy is defined in 
physics as a mathematical 
expression of the degree in 
which the energy of a ther- 
modynamic system is so dis- 
tributed as to be unavailable 
for conversion into work. In 
more general metaphorical 
terms entropy may be seen 
as the irreversible tendency of 
a system, including the 
universe, toward increasing 
disorder and inertness. That 
is to say, things have a way of 
getting worse and worse all 
the time, until in the end 
they get so bad that we lack 
even the means of knowing 
how bad they really are. 

The great American phys- 
icist Josiah Willard Gibbs 
(1839-1903) was the first to 
apply the second law of 
thermodynamics — the law that 
defines the increasing disorder 
of energy moving at random 
within a closed system — to 
chemistry. It was Gibbs who 
most firmly enunciated the 
principle that disorder spon- 
taneously increases as the 
universe grows older. Among 



those who extended Gibbs’ 
insights into the realm of 
philosophy was the brilliant 
mathematician Norbert Wiener 
(1894-1964), who declared in 
his book. The Human Use of 
Human Beings, “As entropy 
increases, the universe, and 
all closed systems in the 
universe, tend naturally to 
deteriorate and lose their 
distinctiveness, to move from 
the least to the most probable 
state, from a state of organi- 
zation and differentiation in 
which distinctions and forms 
exist, to a state of chaos and 
sameness. In Gibbs’ universe 
order is least probable, chaos 
most probable. But while the 
universe as a whole, if indeed 
there is a whole universe, tends 
to run down, there are local 
enclaves whose direction 
seems opposed to that of the 
universe at large and in which 
there is a limited and tempor- 
ary tendency for organization 
to increase. Life finds its home 
in some of these enclaves.” 
Thus Wiener hails living 
things in general and human 
beings in particular as 
heroes in the war against 
entropy — which he equates 
in another passage with the war 
against evil: “This random 

element, this organic imcom- 
pleteness [that is, the funda- 
mental element of chance in 
the texture of the universe]. 



146 



GALAXY 




is one which without too 
violent a figure of speech we 
may consider evil.” Human 
beings, says Wiener, carry on 
anti-entropic processes. We 
have sensory receptors. We 
communicate with one another. 
We make use of what we learn 
from one another. Therefore 
we are something more than 
mere passive victims of the 
spontaneous spread of univer- 
sal chaos. ‘‘We, as human 
beings, are not isolated 
systems. We take in food, 
which generates energy, from 
the outside, and are, as a 
result, parts of that larger 
world which contains those 
sources of our vitality. But 
even more important is the 
fact that we take in informa- 
tion through our sense organs, 
and we act on information 
received.” There is feedback, 
in other words. Through com- 
munication we learn to control 
our environment, and, he 
says, ‘‘In control and com- 
munication we are always 
fighting nature’s tendency to 
degrade the organized and to 
destroy the meaningful; the 
tendency. for entropy to 
increase.” In the very long run 
entropy must inevitably nail 
us all; in the short run we can 
fight back. ‘‘We are not yet 
spectators at the last stages of 
the world’s death.” 

But what if a human being 



turns himself, inadvertently 
or by choice, into an isolated 
system? 

A hermit, say. He lives in 
a dark cave. No information 
penetrates. He eats mush- 
rooms. They give him just 
enough energy to keep going, 
but otherwise he lacks inputs. 
He’s forced back on his own 
spiritual and mental resources, 
which he eventually exhausts. 
Gradually the chaos expands 
in him, gradually the forces 
of entropy seize possession of 
this ganglion, that synapse. 
He takes in a decreasing 
amount of sensory data 
until his surrender to entropy 
is complete. He ceases to 
move, to grow, to respire, to 
function in any way. This 
condition is known as death. 

One doesn’t have to hide in 
a cave. One can make an 
interior migration, locking 
oneself away from the life- 
giving energy sources. Often 
this is done because it appears 
that the energy sources are 
threats to the stability of the 
self. Indeed inputs do threaten 
the self; a push usually will 
upset equilibrium. However, 
equilibrium itself is a threat 
to the self, though this is 
frequently overlooked. There 
are married people who strive 
fiercely to reach equilibrium. 
They seal themselves off, 
clinging to one another and 



DYING INSIDE 



147 




shutting out the rest of the 
universe, making themselves 
into a two-person closed 
system from which all vitality 
is steadily and inexorably 
expelled by the deadly 
equilibrium they have estab- 
lished. Two can perish as well 
as one if they are sufficiently 
isolated from everything else. 
I call this the monogamous 
fallacy. My sister Judith said 
she left her husband because 
she felt herself dying, day by 
day, while she was living with 
him. Of course, Judith’s a 
slut. 

The sensory shutdown is not 
always a willed event, 
naturally. It happens to us 
whether we like it or not. If 
we don’t climb into the box 
ourselves we’ll get shoved in 
anyway. That’s what I mean 
about entropy’s inevitably 
nailing us all in the long run. 
No matter how vital, how 
vigorous, how world-devouring 
we are, the inputs dwindle as 
time goes by. Sight, hearing, 
touch, smell — everything goes, 
as good old Will S. said, and 
we end up sans teeth, sans 
eyes, sans taste, sans every- 
thing. Sans everything. Or, 
as the same clever man also 
put it, from hour to hour we 
ripe and ripe, then from hour 
to hour we rot and rot — and 
thereby hangs a tale. 

I offer myself as a case in 



point. What does this man’s 
sad history reveal? An in- 
explicable diminution of once- 
remarkable powers, A shrink- 
age of the inputs. A small 
death, endured while he still 
lives. Am I not a casualty of 
the entropic wars? Do I not 
now dwindle into stasis and 
silence before your very eyes? 
Is my distress not evident and 
poignant? Who will I be when 
I have ceased to be myself? 
I am dying the heat death. A 
spontaneous decay. A random 
twitch of probability undoes 
me. And I am made into 
nothingness. I am becoming 
cinders and ash. I will wait 
here for the broom to gather 
me up. 

That’s very eloquent, Selig. 
Take an A. Your writing is clear 
and forceful and you show an ex- 
cellent grasp of the underlying 
philosophical issues. You may go 
to the head of the class. Do you 
feel better now? 

XXII 

I T WAS a crazy idea, Kitty, a 
dumb fantasy. It could never 
have worked. 1 was asking the 
impossible from you. There was 
only one conceivable outcome, 
really — that I would annoy you and 
bore you and drive you away from 
me. Well, blame Tom Nyquist. 
It was his idea. No, blame me. 1 



148 



GALAXY 




didn’t have to listen to his crazy 
ideas, did I? Blame me. Blame me. 

Axiom: It’s a sin against love 
to try to remake the soul of 
someone you love, even if you 
think you’ll love her more after 
you’ve transformed her into some- 
thing else. 

Nyquist said, “Maybe she’s a 
mind-reader, too, and the blockage 
is a matter of interference, of a 
clash between your transmissions 
and hers, canceling out the waves 
in one direction or in both. So 
that there’s no transmission from 
her to you and probably none 
from you to her.’’ 

“1 doubt that very much,” 1 told 
him. This was August of 1963, 
two or three weeks after you and 1 
had met. We weren’t living together 
yet but we had already been to bed 
couple of times. “She doesn’t have 
a shred of telepathic ability,” 1 
insisted. “She’s completely normal. 
That’s the e.ssential thing about 
her, Tom — she’s a completely 
normal girl.” 

“Don’t be so sure,” Nyquist 
said. 

He hadn’t met you yet. He 
wanted to meet you, but 1 hadn’t 
set anything up. You had never 
heard his name. 

1 said, “If there’s one thing 1 
know about her, it’s that she’s 
a sane, healthy, nicely balanced, 
absolutely normal girl. Therefore 
she’s no mind-reader.” 



“Because mind-readers are 
insane, unhealthy and unbalanced. 
Like you and like me. Q.E.D., eh? 
Speak for yourself, man.” 

“The gift tips the spirit,” 1 
said. “It darkens the .soul.” 

“Yours, maybe. Not mine.” 

He was right about that. 
Telepathy hadn’t injured him. 
Maybe I’d would have had the 
problems 1 have even if 1 hadn’t 
been born with the gift. 1 can’t 
credit all my maladjustments to 
the presence of one unusual ability, 
can 1? And God knows there are 
plenty of neurotics around who 
have never read a mind in their 
lives. 

Syllogism; 

Some telepaths are not 
neurotic. 

Some neurotics are not 
telepaths. 

Therefore telepathy and neu- 
rosis aren’t necessarily related. 

Corollary: 

You can seem cherry-pie 
normal and still have the power. 

1 remained skeptical of this. 
Nyquist agreed, under pressure, 
that if you did have the power 
you would have probably revealed 
it to me by now through certain 
unconscious mannerisms that 
any telepath would readily 
recognize. I had detected no such 
mannerisms. He suggested, though, 
that you might be a latent telepath 



DYING INSIDE 



149 




— that the gift was there, un- 
developed, unfunctional, lurking at 
the core of your mind and serving 
somehow to screen your mind 
from my probing. Just a hypothe- 
sis, he said. But it tickled me with 
temptation. “Suppose she’s got 
this latent power,” I said. “Could 
it be awakened, do you think?” 

“Why not?” Nyquist asked. 

I was willing to believe it. 1 had 
this vision of your awakened to 
full receptive capacity, able to 
pick up transmissions as easily and 
as sharply as Nyquist and I. How 
intense our love would be then! 
We would be wholly open to one 
another, shorn of all the little 
pretenses and defenses that keep 
even the closest of lovers from 
truly achieving a union of souls. 
1 had already tasted a limited 
form of that sort of closeness with 
Tom Nyquist, but of course 1 
had no love for him, I didn’t even 
really like him, and so it was a 
waste, a brutal irony, that our 
minds could have such intimate 
contact. But you? If 1 could only 
awaken you, Kitty! And why 
not? I asked Nyquist if he 
thought it might be possible. Try 
it and find out, he said. Make 
experiments. Hold hands, sit 
together in the dark, put some 
energy into trying to get across to 
her. It’s worth trying, isn’t it? Yes, 
1 said, of course it’s worth trying. 

Y OU seemed latent in so 
many other ways, Kitty — a 



potential human being rather than 
an actual one. An air of adoles- 
cence surrounded you. You seemed 
much younger than you actually 
were — if I hadn’t known you were a 
college graduate I would have 
guessed you were eighteen or nine- 
teen. You hadn’t read much 
outside your fields of interest — 
mathematics, computers, technol- 
ogy — and, since those weren’t my 
fields of interest, I thought of you 
as not having read anything at 
all. So I saw you as raw material 
awaiting the sculptor’s hand. I 
would be your Pygmalion. 

In September of 1963 you 
moved in with me. You were spend- 
ing so much time at my place 
anyway that you agreed it didn’t 
make sense to keep going back and 
forth. I felt very married — wet 
stockings hanging over the shower- 
curtain rod, an extra toothbrush 
on the shelf, long brown hairs in 
the sink. The warmth of you 
beside me in bed every night. My 
belly against your smooth cool 
butt, yang and yin. I gave you 
books to read: poetry, novels, 
essays. How diligently you 
devoured them! You read Trilling 
on the bus going to work and 
Conrad in the quiet after- 
dinner hours and Yeats on a Sun- 
day morning while I was out 
hunting for the Times. But nothing 
really seemed to stick with you — 
you had no natural bent for 
literature. I think you had trouble 
distinguishing Lord Jim from 



150 



GALAXY 




Lucky Jim, Malcolm Lowry from 
Malcolm Cowley, James Joyce 
from Joyce Kilmer. Your fine 

mind, so easily able to master 
COBOL and fortran, could not 
decipher the language of poetry and 
you would look up from The 
Waste Land, baffled, to ask 
some naive schoolgirl question 
that would leave me irritated for 
hours. A hopeless case, I some- 
times thought. Although on a 
day when the stock market was 
closed you took me down to the 
computer center where you 
worked and I listened to your 
explanations of the equipment and 
your functions as though you 
were talking so much Sanskrit to 
me. Different worlds, different 
kinds of mind. Yet I always had 
hope of creating a bridge. 

At strategically timed moments 
I spoke elliptically of my interest 
in extrasensory phenomena. 

I made it out to be a hobby of 

mine, a cool dispassionate study. 
I was fascinated, I said, by the 
possibility of attaining true mind- 
to-mind communication between 
human beings. I took care not to 
come on like a fanatic, not to 
oversell my case. 1 kept my 
desperation out of sight. Because 
1 genuinely couldn’t read you, it 
was easier for me to pretend to a 
scholarly objectivity than it 
would have been with anyone else. 
And I had to pretend. My 
strategy didn’t allow for any true 
confessions. 1 didn’t want to 



frighten you, Kitty. 1 didn’t 
want to turn you off by giving you 
reason to think 1 was a freak or, 
as it probably would have seemed 
to you, a lunatic. Just a hobby, 
then. A hobby. 

You couldn’t bring yourself to 
believe in ESP. If it can’t be 
measured with a voltmeter or 
recorded on an electroencephalo- 
graph, you said, it isn’t real. Be 
tolerant, I pleaded. There are 
such things as telepathic powers. 
I know there are. (Be careful, 
Duv!) I couldn’t cite EEG readings 
— I’ve never been near an EEG in 
my life, have no idea whether my 
power would register. And I had 
barred myself from conquering 
your skepticism by calling in 
some outsider and doing some 
party-game mind-reading on him. 
But 1 could offer other arguments. 
Look at Rhine’s results, look at 
all these series of correct readings 
of the Zener cards. How can you 
explain them, if not by ESP? And 
the evidence for telekinesis, 
teleportation, clairvoyance. 

You remained skeptical, coolly 
putting down most of the data I 
cited. Your reasoning was keen 
and close — there was nothing 
fuzzy about yoilr mind when it was 
on its own home territory, the 
scientific method. Rhine, you said, 
fudges his results by testing 
heterogeneous groups, then select- 
ing for further testing only those 
subjects who show unusual runs of 
luck, dropping the others from his 



DYING INSIDE 



151 




surveys. And he publishes only 
the scores that seem to prove his 
thesis. It’s a statistical anomaly, 
not an extrasensory one, that 
turns up all those correct guesses 
of the Zener cards, you insisted. 
Besides, the experimenter is 
prejudiced in 'favor of belief in 
ESP — and that surety leads to 
all sorts of unconscious errors of 
procedure, tiny accesses of un- 
intentional bias that inevitably 
skew the outcome. Cautiously I 
invited you to try some experi- 
ments with me, letting you set up 
the procedures to suit yourself. 
You said okay mainly, I think, 
because it was something we 
could do together and — this was 
early October — we were already 
searching for areas of closeness, 
your literary education having be- 
come a strain for both of us. 

W E AGREED — how subtly 
I made it seem like your 
own idea! — to concentrate on 
transmitting images or ideas to 
one another. And right at the 
outset we had a cruelly deceptive 
success. We assembled some 
packets of pictures and tried to 
relay them mentally. 1 still have, 
here in the archives, our notes 
on those experiments:

locomotive and airplane. (Flowers, 
buildings, heavy-duty equipment, 
means of transportation.) Enough 
to give us false hopes of true trans-

No direct hits for me either. But 
three close associations, of sorts, 
out of ten; tropical beach and 
sunny landscape, George Washing- 
ton Bridge and the Washington 
Monument, highway at rush hour 
and beehive — the common denomi- 
nators being sunlight, George 
Washington and intense, tight- 
packed activity. At least we de- 
ceived ourselves into seeing them 
as close associations rather than 
coincidences. I confess 1 was 
stabbing in the dark at all times, 
guessing rather than receiving, 
and I had little faith even then in 
the quality of our responses. 
Nevertheless those probably ran- 
dom collisions of images aroused 
your curiosity — there’s something 
in this stuff, maybe, you began to 
say. 

We varied the conditions for 
thought transmission. We tried 
doing it in absolute darkness, 
one room apart. We tried it with 
the lights on, holding hands. We 
tried it during sex. We tried it 
drunk. We tried it fasting. We 



tried it under conditions of sleep 
deprivation, forcing ourselves to 
stay up around the clock in the 
random hope that minds groggy 
with fatigue might permit mental 
impulses to slip through the 
barriers separating us. We sought 
in a dozen other ways to open the 
telepathic conduit. I thought you 
were as dedicated to the work as I 
was. But it had ceased to be either 
an experiment or a game — it was, 
you saw, plainly an obsessive 
quest and you asked several 
times in November if we could 
quit. All this mind-reading, you 
said, left you with woeful head- 
aches. But I couldn’t give up, 
Kitty. 1 overrode your objections 
and insisted we go on. I was 
hooked, I brow-beat you merci- 
lessly into cooperating, 1 tyran- 
nized you in the name of love, 
seeing always that telepathic Kitty 
1 would ultimately produce. Every 
ten days, maybe, some delusive 
flicker of seeming contact buoyed 
my idiotic optimism. We would 
break through; we would touch 
each other’s minds. How could 
1 quit now when we were so close? 
But we were never close. 

E arly in November Nyquist 
gave one of his occasional 
dinner parties, catered by a 
Chinatown restaurant he favored. 
His parties were always brilliant 
events — to refuse the invitation 
would have been absurd. So at 
last I would have to expose you to 



DYING INSIDE

him. For more than three months 
I had been more or less deliberately 
concealing you from him, avoiding 
the moment of confrontation out 
of a cowardice I didn’t fully under- 
stand. We came late — you were 
slow getting ready. I introduced 
you to Nyquist. He smiled and 
murmured a sleek compliment and 
gave you a bland, impersonal 
kiss. You seemed shy, almost 
afraid of him, of his confidence 
and smoothness. After a moment of 
patter he went spinning away to 
answer the doorbell. A ^little 
later, as we were handed our first 
drinks, I planted a thought for 
him: 

— Well? What do you think of 
her? 

But he was too busy with his 
other guests to probe me and 
didn’t pick up on my question. 
I had to seek my own answers in 
his skull. I inserted myself — he 
glanced at me across the room, 
realizing what 1 was doing — and 
rummaged for information. Layers 
of hostly trivia masked his 
surface levels: he was simultan- 
eously offering drinks, steering 
a conversation, signaling for the 
eggrolls to be brought from the 
kitchen and inwardly going over 
the guest list to see who was yet 
to arrive. But I cut swiftly 
through that stuff and in a 
moment found his locus of Kitty- 
thoughts. At once I acquired the 
knowledge I wanted and dreaded. 
He could read you. Yes. To him 



you were as transparent as anyone 
else. Only to me were you opaque, 
for reasons none of us knew. 
Nyquist had instnatly penetrated 
you, had assessed you, had formed 
his judgment of you, there for me 
to examine — he saw you as 
awkward, immature, naive, yet 
also attractive and charming. 
(That’s how he really saw you. 
I’m not trying, for ulterior reasons 
of my own, to make him seem 
more critical of you than he 
really was. You were very young — 
you were unsophisticated and he 
saw that. The discovery numbed 
me. Jealousy curdled me. That I 
should work so ponderously for so 
many weeks to reach you, getting 
nowhere, and he could knife so 
easily to your depths, Kitty! I 
was instantly suspicious. Nyquist 
and his malicious games — was 
this yet one more? Could he 
read you? How could 1 be sure 
he hadn’t planted a fiction for me? 
He picked up on that: 

— You don’t trust me? Of course 
I’m reading her. 

— Maybe yes, maybe no. 

— Do you want me to prove it? 

—How? 

—Watch. 

Without interrupting for a 
moment his role of host, he 
entered your mind, while mine 
remained locked on his. And so, 
through him, I had my first and 
only glimpse of your inwardness, 
Kitty, reflected by way of Tom 
Nyquist. Oh! It was no glimpse I 



154 



GALAXY 




ever wanted. I saw myself 
through your eyes through his 
mind. Physically I looked, if 
anything, better than 1 imagined 
I would, my shoulders broader 
than they really are, my face 
leaner, the features more regular. 
You left no doubt that you 
responded to me physically. But 
the emotional associations! You 
saw me as stern father, as grim 
schoolmaster, as grumbling 
tyrant. Read this, read that, 
improve your mind, girl! Study 
hard to be worthy of me! Oh! 
Oh! And that flaming core of 
resentment over our ESP experi- 
ments — worse than useless to you, 
a monumental bore, an excursion 
into insanity, a wearying, grinding 
drag. Night after night to be bug- 
ged by monomaniacal me. Even 
our screwing invaded by the 
foolish quest for mind-to-mind 
contact. How sick you were of me, 
Kitty! How monstrously dull 
you thought me! 

Stung, I retreated, pulling away 
quickly from Nyquist. You looked 
at me in a startled way, I recall, 
as if you knew on some subliminal 
level that mental energies were 
flashing around the room, reveal- 
ing the privacies of your soul. You 
blinked and your cheeks reddened 
and you took a hasty diving gulp of 
your drink. Nyquist shot me a sar- 
donic smile. I couldn’t meet his 
eyes. 

Later, after we had eaten, I saw 
you talking animatedly to Nyquist 



at the far side of the room. You 
were flirtatious and giddy. I 
imagined you were discussing me 
and not being complimentary. I 
tried to pick up the conversation 
by way of Nyquist, but at my first 
tentative probe he glared at me. 

— Get out of my head, will you? 

1 obeyed. 1 heard your laughter, 
too loud, rising above the hum of 
conversation. 1 drifted off to talk 
to a lithe little Japanese sculptress 
whose flat tawny chest sprouted 
untemptingly from a low-cut black 
sheath, and found her thinking, in 
French, that she would like me to 
ask her to go home with me. But 
1 went home with you, Kitty, sitting 
sullen and graceless beside you on 
the empty subway train. And when 
I asked you what you and Nyquist 
had been discussing you said, “Oh, 
we were just kidding around. Just 
having a little fun.” 

ABOUT two weeks later, on a 
AA. clear crisp autumn afternoon. 
President Kennedy was shot in 
Dallas. The stock market closed 
early after a calamitous slide and 
Martinson shut down the office, 
turning me out, dazed, into the 
street. I couldn’t easily accept the 
reality of the progression of events. 
Someone shot at the President. 
someone shot the President. 
someone shot the President in the 
head. .the President has been 
critically wounded. .the President 
has been rushed to Parkland Hos- 
pital. .the President has received

155 




the last rites. .the President is 
dead. Kennedy was the only presi- 
dential candidate 1 ever voted for 
who won — and they killed him: 
the story of my life in one com- 
pressed bloody parable. 

That November afternoon 1 
picked up emanations of fear on 
all sides as I walked fearfully 
home. Paranoia was general every- 
where. People sidled warily, one 
shoulder in front of the other, ready 
to bolt. Pale female faces peered 
between parted curtains in the 
windows of the towering apartment 
houses, high above the silent 
streets. No one lingered in the 
open — everyone hurried toward 
shelter. Anything might happen 
now. Packs of wolves might burst 
out of Riverside Drive. Maddened 
patriots might launch a program. 
From my apartment — door bolted, 
windows locked — I tried to phone 
you at the computer center, think- 
ing you might somehow not have 
heard the news. Or perhaps I just 
wanted to hear your voice in this 
traumatic time. The telephone 
lines were choked. I gave up the 
attempt after twenty minutes. 
Then, wandering aimlessly from 
bedroom to living room and back, 
clutching my transistor, twisting 
the dial trying to find one radio 
station whose newscaster would 
tell me that he was still alive after 
all, I detoured into the kitchen 
and found your note on the table, 
telling me that you were leaving, 
that you couldn’t stay with me any 



more. The note was dated 
10:30 A.M., before the assassina- 
tion, in another era. f rushed to 
the bedroom closet and saw what 
I had not seen before, that your 
things were gone. When women 
leave me, Kitty, they leave sud- 
denly and stealthily, giving no 
warning. 

T oward evening 1 telephoned 
Nyquist. This time the lines 
were open. “Is Kitty there?” 1 
asked. “Yes,” he said. “Just a 
minute.” And put you on. You 
explained that you were going to 
live with him for a while until you 
got yourself sorted out. He had 
been very helpful. No, you had no 
hard feelings toward me, no bitter- 
ness at all. It was just that I 
seemed, well, insensitive, whereas 
he — he had this instinctive, intuitive 
grasp of your emotional needs — 
he was able to get onto your trip, 
Kitty, and I couldn’t manage that. 
So you had gone to him for com- 
fort and love. Goodbye, you said, 
and thanks for everything, and I 
muttered a goodbye and put down 
the phone. During the night the 
weather changed and a weekend of 
black skies and cold rain saw JFK 
to his grave. I missed everything, 
the casket in the rotunda, the brave 
widow and the gallant children, the 
murder of Oswald, the funeral pro- 
cession, all that instant history. 
Saturday and Sunday I slept late, 
got drunk, read six books without 
absorbing a word. On Monday, 



156 



GALAXY 




the day of national mourning, 1 
wrote you that incoherent letter, 
Kitty, explaining everything, telling 
you what I had tried to make out 
of you and why, confessing my 
power to you and describing the 
effects it had had on my life. Telling 
you also about Nyquist, warning 
you of what he was, that he had 
the power, too, that he could read 
you and you would have no secrets 
from him. Telling you not to mis- 
take him for a real human being, 
telling you that he was a machine, 
self-programed for maximum self- 
realization. That the power had 
made him cold and cruelly strong 
whereas it had made me weak and 
jittery, insisting that essentially he 
was as sick as I, a manipulative 
man, incapable of giving love, capa- 
ble only of using. I told you that he 
would hurt you if you made your- 
self vulnerable to him. 

You didn’t answer. I never heard 
from you again, never saw you 
again, never heard from him or 
saw him again either. Thirteen 
years. I have no idea what became 
of either of you. Probably I’ll 
never know. But listen. Listen. I 
loved you, lady, in my clumsy way. 
1 love you now. And you are lost to 
me forever. 

XXIII 

E WAKES, feeling stiff and 
sore and numb, in a bleak, 
dreary hospital ward. Evidently 
this is St. Luke’s, perhaps the 



emergency room. His lower lip is 
swollen. His left eye opens only 
reluctantly and his nose makes an 
unfamiliar whistling sound at every 
intake of air. Did they bring him 
here on a stretcher after the basket- 
ball players finished with him? He 
has spent relatively little time in 
hospitals. He wonders if his cloth- 
ing is stained with dried blood, but 
when he succeeds in looking down 
— his neck, oddly rigid, does not 
want to obey him — he sees only 
the dingy whiteness of a hospital 
gown. Each time he breathes he 
imagines he can feel the ragged 
edges of broken ribs scraping to- 
gether. Slipping a hand under the 
gown, he touches his bare chest and 
finds that it has not been taped. He 
does not know whether to be re- 
lieved or apprehensive about that. 

Carefully he sits up. The room is 
crowded and noisy, beds pushed 
close together. The beds have cur- 
tains but no curtains are drawn. 
Most of his fellow patients are 
black and many of them are in 
serious condition, surrounded by 
festoons of equipment. Impassive 
nurses drift through the room, 
showing much the same distant 
concern for the patients as museum 
guards do for mummies in display 
cases. No one is paying any atten- 
tion to Selig except Selig, who 
returns to the examination of him- 
self. His fingertips explore his 
cheeks. Without a mirror he cannot 
tell how battered his face is, but 
there are many tender places. His 




DYING INSIDE 



157 




left clavicle aches as from a light, 
glancing karate chop. His right 
knee radiates throbbings and 
twinges, as though he had twisted 
it in falling. Still, he feels less pain 
than might have been anticipated. 
Perhaps they have given him some 
sort of shot. 

His mind is foggy. He is receiving 
some mental input from those 
about him in the ward, but every- 
thing is garbled, nothing is distinct; 
he picks up auras but no intelligible 
verbalizations. Diagonally across 
from him, two nurses have begun 
to erect what perhaps is a forced- 
feeding system, with a plastic tube 
snaking into the nostril of a 
huge unconscious bandage-swathed 
black. Selig’s own stomach sends 
him no hunger signals. The chemi- 
cal smell in the hospital air gives 
him nausea — he can barely sali- 
vate. Will they feed him this even- 
ing? How long will he be kept here? 
Who pays? Should he ask that 
Judith be notified? How badly has 
he been injured? 

An intern enters the ward, a short 
dark man, concise and fine-boned 
of body, a Pakistani by the looks 
of him, moving with bouncy pre- 
cision. Surprisingly, he comes right 
to Selig. “The X-rays show no 
breakages,” he says without pre- 
amble in a firm, unresonant voice. 
“Therefore your only injuries are 
minor abrasions, bruises, cuts and 
an unimportant concussion. We 
are ready to authorize your re- 
lease. Please get up.” 



“Wait,” Selig says feebly. “I just 
came to. I don’t know what’s been 
going on. Who brought me here? 
How long have I been unconscious? 
What—” 

“1 know none of these things. 
Your discharge has been approved 
and the hospital has need of this 
bed. Please. On your feet, now. I 
have much to do.” 

“A concussion? Shouldn’t 1 
spend the night here, at least, if 
I had a concussion? Or did 1 spend 
the night here? What day is today?” 

“You were brought in about 
noon today,” says the intern, grow- 
ing more fretful. “You were treated 
in the emergency room and given a 
thorough examination after having 
been beaten on the steps of Low 
Library.” Once more the command 
to rise, given wordlessly this time, 
an imperious glare and a pointing 
forefinger. Selig probes the intern’s 
mind and finds it accessible, but 
there is nothing in it except im- 
patience and irritation. Ponder- 
ously Selig climbs from the bed. 
His body seems to be held together 
with wire. His bones grind and 
scrape. There is still the sensation 
of broken rib ends rubbing in his 
chest; can the X-ray have been in 
error? He starts to ask, but too 
late. The intern, making his rounds, 
has whirled off to another bed. 

They bring him his clothing. He 
pulls the curtain around his bed 
and dresses. Yes, bloodstains on his 
shirt as he had feared — also on his 
trousers. A mess. He checks his be- 



158 



GALAXY 




longings. Everything is here, wallet, 
wristwatch, pocket comb. What 
now? Just walk out? Nothing to 
sign? Selig edges uncertainly 
toward the door. He actually gets 
into the corridor unperceived. Then 
the intern materializes as if from 
ectoplasm and points to another 
room across the hall, saying, “You 
wait in there until the security man 
comes.” Security man? What se- 
curity man? 

There are, as he had feared, 
papers to sign before he is free of 
the hospital’s grasp. Just as he 
finishes with the red tape, a plump, 
gray-faced, sixtyish man in the 
uniform of the campus security 
force enters the room, puffing 
slightly, and asks, “You Selig?” 

He acknowledges that he is. 

“The dean wants to see you. You 
able to walk by yourself or you 
want me to get you a wheelchair?” 
“I’ll walk,” Selig says. 

T hey go out of the hospital 
together, up Amsterdam Ave- 
nue to the 1 15th Street campus 
gate and into Van Am Quad. The 
security man stays close Iteside 
him, saying nothing. Shortly Selig 
finds himself waiting outside the 
office of the Dean of Columbia 
College. The security man waits 
with him, arms folded placidly, 
wrapped in a cocoon of boredom. 
Selig begins to feel almost as 
though he is under some sort of 
arrest. Why is that? An odd 
thought. What does he have to fear 



from the dean? He probes the se- 
curity man’s dull mind but can find 
nothing in it but fog.” 

A voice from within says, “Dean 
Cushing will see him now.” 

“Go on in,” the security man 
says. 

Cushing? A fine deanly name. 
Who is he? Selig limps in, awkward 
from his injuries, bothered by his 
sore knee. Facing him behind a 
glistening uncluttered desk sits a 
wide-shouldered, smooth-cheeked, 
youthful-looking man, junior- 
executive model, wearing a con- 
servative dark suit. Selig’s first 
thought is of the mutations worked 
by the passage of time — he had 
always looked upon deans as lofty 
symbols of authority, necessarily 
elderly or at least of middle years, 
but here is the Dean of the College 
and he seems to be a man of Selig’s 
own age. Then he realizes that this 
dean is not merely an anonymous 
contemporary of his but actually 
a classmate, Ted Cushing ’56, a 
campus figure of some repute back 
then, class president, football star 
and A-level scholar, whom Selig 
had known at least in a passing 
way. It always surprises Selig to be 
reminded that he is no longer 
young, that he has lived into a time 
when his generation has. control of 
the mechanisms of power. “Ted?” 
he blurts. “Are you dean now, Ted? 
Christ, I wouldn’t have guessed 
that. When — ” 

“Sit down, Dave,” Cushing says 
politely but with no great show of 



DYING INSIDE 



159 




friendliness. “Did you get badly 
hurt?” 

“The hospital says nothing’s 
broken. 1 feel half ruined, though.” 
As he eases into a chair he indicates 
the bloodstains on his clothing, 
the bruises on his face. Talking is 
an effort — his jaws creak at their 
hinges. “Hey, Ted, it’s been a long 
time! Must be twenty years since I 
last saw you. Did you remember 
my name or did they identify me 
from my wallet?” 

“We’ve arranged to pay the 
hospital costs,” Cushing says, not 
seeming to hear Selig’s words. “If 
there are any further medical ex- 
penses we’ll take care of those, too. 
You can have that in writing if 
you’d like.” 

“The verbal commitment is 
fine. And in case you’re worrying 
that I’ll press charges or sue the 
University — well, I wouldn’t do 
anything like that. Boys will be 
boys. TTiey let their feelings run 
away with themselves a little bit, 
but?” 

“We weren’t greatly concerned 
about your pressing charges, 
Dave,” Cushing says quietly. “The 
real question is whether we’re going 
to press charges against you.” 

“Me? For what? For getting 
mauled by your basketball players? 
For damaging their expensive 
hands with my face?” He essays a 
painful grin. Cushing’s face re- 
mains grave. Selig struggles to 
interpret Cushing’s joke. Finding 
no rationale for it, he decides to 



venture a probe. But he runs into a 
wall. He is suddenly too timid to 
push, fearful that he will be unable 
to break through. “1 don’t under- 
stand what you mean,” he says 
finally. “Press charges for what?” 
“For these, Dave.” For the first 
time Selig notices the stack of type- 
written pages on the dean’s desk. 
Cushing nudges them forward. “Do 
you recognize them? Here, take a 
look.” 

S ELIG leafs unhappily through 
them. They are term papers, all 
of them of his manufacture. Odys- 
seus as a Symbol of Society. The 
Novels of Ka/ka. Aeschylus and 
the Aristotelian Tragedy. Resigna- 
tion and Acceptance in the Philoso- 
phy of Montaigne. Virgil as 
Dante’s Mentor. Some of them 
bear marks — A-, B-(-, A-, A — and 
marginal comments, mainly favor- 
able. Some are untouched except 
by smudges and smears. These are 
the ones he had been about to 
deliver when he was set upon by 
Lumumba. With immense care he 
tidies the stack, aligning the edges 
of the sheets precisely, and pushes 
them back toward Cushing. “All 
right,” he says. “You’ve got me.” 
“Did you write those?” 

“Yes.” 

“For a fee?” 

“Yes.” 

“That’s sad, Dave. That’s aw- 
fully sad.” 

“I needed to earn a living. They 
don’t give scholarships to alumni.” 



160 



GALAXY 




“What were you getting paid for 
these things?” 

“Three or four bucks a typed 
page.” 

Cushing shakes his head. “You 
were good — I’ll give you credit for 
that. There must be eight or ten 
guys working your racket here, but 
you’re easily the best.” 

“Thank you.” 

“But you had one dissatisfied 
customer. We asked Lumumba 
why he beat you up. He said he 
hired you to write a term paper for 
him and you did a lousy job — you 
ripped him off — and then you 
wouldn’t refund his money. All 
right. We’re dealing with him in 
our own way, but we have to deal 
with you, too. We’ve been trying 
to find you for a long time, Dave.” 

“Have you?” 

“We’ve circulated xeroxes of 
your work through a dozen depart- 
ments the last couple of semesters, 
warning people to ^ on the lookout 
for your typewriter and your style. 
There wasn’t a great deal of cooper- 
ation. A lot of faculty members 
didn’t seem to care whether the 
term papers they received were 
phony or not. But we cared, Dave. 
We cared very much.” Cushing 
leans forward. His eyes, terribly 
earnest, seek Selig’s. Selig looks 
away. He cannot abide the search- 
ing warmth of those eyes. “We 
started closing in a few weeks ago,” 
Cushing continues. “We rounded 
up a couple of your clients and 
threatened them with expulsion. 



They gave us your name, but they 
didn’t know where you lived and we 
had no way of finding you. So we 
waited. We knew you’d show up 
again to deliver and solicit. Then 
we got this report of a disturbance 
on the steps of Low — basketball 
players beating up somebody — and 
we found you with a pile of un- 
delivered papers clutched in your 
arm and that was it. You’re out of 
business, Dave.” 

“I should ask for a lawyer,” 
Selig says. “I shouldn’t admit 
anything more to you. I should 
have denied everything when you 
showed me those papers.” 

“No need to be so technical 
about your rights.” 

“I’ll need to be when you take 
me to court, Ted.” 

“No,” Cushing says. “We aren’t 
going to prosecute, not unless we 
catch you ghosting more papers. 
We have no interest in putting you 
in jail and, in any case. I’m not sure 
that what you’ve done is a criminal 
offense. What we really want to do 
is help you. You’re sick, Dave. For 
a man of your intelligence, of your 
potential, to have fallen so low, to 
have ended up faking term papers 
for college kids — that’s sad, Dave, 
that’s awfully sad. We’ve discussed 
your case here and we’ve come up 
with a rehabilitation plan for you. 
We can find you work on campus, 
as a research assistant, maybe. 
There are always doctoral candi- 
dates who need assistants and we 
have a small fund we could dip into 



DYING INSIDE

to provide a salary for you. Noth- 
ing much — but at least as much as 
you were making on these papers. 
And we’ll admit you to the psy- 
chological counseling service here. 
It wasn’t set up for alumni, but I 
don’t see why we need to be inflexi- 
ble about it, Dave. For myself, I 
have to say that 1 find it embar- 
rassing that a man of the Class of 
’56 is in the kind of trouble you’re 
in. If only out of a spirit of loyalty 
to our class, 1 want to do everything 
possible to help you put yourself 
back together and begin to fulfill 
the promise that you showed 
when. .” 

C USHING rambles on, restat- 
ing and embellishing his 
themes, offering pity without cen- 
sure, promising aid to his suffering 
classmate. Selig, listening inat- 
tentively, discovers that Cushing’s 
mind is beginning to open to him. 
The wall that earlier had separated 
their consciousnesses, a product 
perhaps of Selig’s fear and fatigue, 
has started to dissolve and Selig 
is able now to perceive a general 
image of Cushing’s mind, which is 
energetic, strong, capable, but also 
conventional and limited, a stolid 
Republican mind, a prosaic Ivy 
League mind. 

Foremost in it is not his concern 
for Selig but rather his complacent 
satisfaction with himself — the 
brightest glow emanates from 
Cushing’s awareness of his happy 
station in life, ornamented by a 



suburban split-level, a strapping 
blond wife, three handsome chil- 
dren, a shaggy dog, a shining new 
Lincoln Continental. Pushing a 
bit deeper, Selig sees that Cushing’s 
show of concern for him is fraudu- 
lent. Behind the earnest eyes and 
the sincere, heartfelt, sympathetic 
smile lies fierce contempt. Cushing 
despises him. Cushing thinks he is 
corrupt, useless, worthless, a dis- 
grace to mankind in general and 
the Columbia College Class of ’56 
in particular. Cushing finds him 
physically as well as morally re- 
pugnant, seeing him as unwashed 
and unclean, possibly syphilitic. 
Cushing suspects him of being 
homosexual. Cushing has for him 
the scorn of the Rotarian for the 
junkie. It is impossible for Cushing 
to understand why anyone who 
has had the benefit of a Columbia 
education would let himself slide 
into the degradations Selig has 
accepted. Selig shrinks from Cush- 
ing’s disgust. Am I so despicable, 
he wonders, am I such trash? 

His hold on Cushing’s mind 
strengthens and deepens. It ceases 
to trouble him that Cushing has 
such contempt for him. Selig 
drifts into a mode of abstraction 
in which he no longer identifies 
himself with the miserable churl 
Cushing sees. What does Cushing 
know? Can Cushing penetrate the 
mind of another? Can Cushing feel 
the ecstasy of real contact with a 
fellow human being? And there is 
ecstasy in it. Godlike he rides pas-

senger in Cushing’s mind, sinking 
past the external defenses, past the 
petty prides and snobberies, past 
the self-congratulatory smugness, 
into the realm of absolute values, 
into the kingdom of authentic self. 
Contact. Ecstasy! That stolid Cush- 
ing is the outer husk. Here is a 
Cushing that even Cushing does 
not know. But Selig does. 

Selig has not been so happy in 
years. Light, golden and serene, 
floods his soul. An irresistible 
gaiety possesses him. He runs 
through misty groves at dawn, 
feeling the gentle lashing of moist 
green fern fronds against his shins. 
Sunlight pierces the canopy of high 
foliage and droplets of dew glitter 
with a cool inner fire. The birds 
awaken. Their song is tender and 
sweet, a distant cheebling, sleepy 
and soft. He runs through the 
forest and he is not alone, for a 
hand grasps his hand. And he 
knows that he has never been alone 
and never will be alone. The forest 
floor is damp and spongy beneath 
his bare feet. He runs. He runs. An 
invisible choir strikes a harmonious 
note and holds it, holds it, holds it, 
swelling it in perfect crescendo, 
until, just as he breaks from the 
grove and sprints into a sun-bright 
meadow, that swell of tone fills all 
the cosmos, reverberating in magi- 
cal fullness. He throws himself 
face-forward to the ground, hug- 
ging the earth, writhing against the 
fragrant grassy carpet, flattening 
his hands against the curve of the 



planet, and he is aware of the 
world’s inner throbbing. This is 
ecstasy! This is contact! Other 
minds surround his. In whatever 
direction he moves, he feels their 
presence, welcoming him, support- 
ing him, reaching toward him. 
Come, they say, join us, join us, 
be one with us, give up those tat- 
tered shreds of self, let go of all 
that holds you apart from us. Yes, 
Selig replies. Yes. I affirm the 
ecstasy of life. 1 affirm the joy of 
contact. 1 give myself to you. They 
touch him. He touches them. It was 
for this, he knows, that 1 received 
my gift, my blessing, my power. 
For this moment of affirmation and 
fulfillment. Join us. Join us. Yes! 
The birds! The invisible choir! The 
dew! The meadow! The sun! He 
laughs. He rises and breaks into 
an ecstatic dance. He throws back 
his head to sing, he who has never 
in his life dared to sing, and the 
tones that come from him are rich 
and full, pure, squarely striking 
the center of the pitch. Yes! Oh, 
the joining, the touching, the 
union, the oneness! No longer is he 
David Selig. He is a part of them 
and they are a part of him and in 
that joyous blending he experiences 
loss of self. He gives up all that is 
tired and worn and sour in him — 
he gives up his fears and uncertain- 
ties; he gives up everything that has 
separated himself from himself for 
so many years. He breaks through. 
He is fully open and the immense 
signal of the universe rushes freely 



DYING INSIDE

into him. He receives. He trans- 
mits. He absorbs. He radiates. 
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. 

He knows this ecstasy will last 
forever. 

But in the moment of that 
knowledge he feels it slipping from 
him. The choir’s glad note dimin- 
ishes. The sun drops toward the 
horizon. The distant sea, retreating, 
sucks at the shore. He struggles to 
hold to the joy, but the more he 
struggles the more of it he loses. 
Hold back the tide? How? Delay 
the fall of night? How? How? The 
birdsongs are faint now. The air 
has turned cold. Everything rushes 
away from him. He stands alone in 
the gathering darkness, remember- 
ing that ecstasy, recapturing it 
momentarily, reliving it — for it is 
already gone, and must be sum- 
moned back through an act of the 
will. Gone, yes. It is very quiet 
suddenly. He hears one last sound, 
a stringed instrument in the dis- 
tance, a cello, perhaps, being 
plucked, pizzicato, a beautiful 
melancholy sound. Twang. The 
plangent chord. Twing. The break- 
ing string. Twang. The lyre un- 
tuned. Twang. Twing. Twong. And 
nothing more. Silence envelops 
him. A terminal silence, it is, that 
booms through the caverns of his 
skull, the silence that follows the 
shattering of the cello’s strings, 
the silence that comes with the 
death of music. He can hear noth- 
ing. He can feel nothing. He is 
alone. He is alone. 



He is alone. 

“So quiet,” he murmurs. “So 
private. It’s — so — private — here.” 

“Selig?” a deep voice asks. 
“What’s the matter with you, 
Selig?” 

“I’m all right,” Selig says. He 
tries to stand, but nothing has any 
solidity. He is tumbling through 
Cushing’s desk, through the floor 
of the office, falling through the 
planet itself, seeking and not find- 
ing a stable platform. “So quiet. 
The silence, Ted, the silence!” 
Strong arms seize him. He is 
aware of several figures bustling 
about him. Someone is calling for 
a doctor. Selig shakes his head, 
protesting that nothing is wrong 
with him, nothing at all, except 
for the silence in his head, except 
for the silence, except for the 
silence. 

Except for the silence. 

XXIV 

W INTER is here. Sky and 
pavement form a seamless, 
inexorable band of gray. There will 
be snow soon. Silence reigns. 
Scrawny black and gray cats, 
motionless, statues of themselves, 
peer out of alleys. Traffic is light. 
Walking quickly through the 
streets from the subway station to 
Judith’s place, I avert my eyes 
from the faces of the few people I 
pass. I feel shy and self-conscious 
among them, like a war veteran 
who has just been discharged from

the rehabilitation center and is 
still embarrassed about his mutila- 
tions. Naturally I’m unable to tell 
what anybody is thinking. Their 
minds are closed to me now and 
they go by me wearing shields of 
impenetrable ice. But, ironically, 
1 have the illusion that they all 
have access to me. They can look 
right into me and see me for what 
I’ve become. There’s David Selig, 
they must be thinking. How care- 
less he was! What a poor custodian 
of his gift! He messed up and let 
it all slip away from him, the dope. 
1 feel guilty for causing them this 
disappointment. Yet I don’t feel 
as guilty as I thought I might. On 
some ultimate level I just don’t 
give a damn at all. This is what I 
am, I tell myself. This is what I 
now shall be. If you don’t like it, 
tough crap. Try to accept me. If 
you can’t do that, just ignore me. 

<< AS THE truest society ap- 
proaches always nearer to 
solitude, so the most excellent 
speech finally falls into silence. 
Silence is audible to all men, at all 
times, and in all places.” So said 
Thoreau, in 1849, in A Week on the 
Concord and Merrimack Rivers. 
Of course Thoreau was a misfit 
and an outsider with very serious 
neurotic problems. When he was a 
young man just out of college he 
fell in love with a girl named Ellen 
Sewall, but she turned him down 
and he never married. I wonder if 
he ever made it with anybody. 



Probably not. Poor Thoreau. 
Silence is audible, Henry. 

I IMAGINE, as I near Judith’s 
building, that I meet Toni in the 
street. I seem to see a tall figure 
walking toward me from Riverside 
Drive, hatless, bundled up in a 
bulky orange coat. Strangely 1 feel 
neither excitement nor apprehen- 
sion over this unexpected reunion. 
I am quite calm, almost unmoved. 
Coolly I halt in her path, smile, 
hold up my hands in greeting. 
“Toni?” I say. “Don’t you know 
me?” 

She studies me, frowns, seems 
puzzled for a moment. But only a 
moment. “David. Hello.” Her 

face looks more lean, the cheek- 
bones higher and sharper. There 
are some strands of gray in her 
hair. Well, of course she’s in her 
middle thirties now. Not exactly a 
girl. As old now, in fact, as 1 was 
when I first met her. But in fact 1 
know she has hardly changed at 
all, only matured a little. She 

seems as beautiful as ever. Yet 

desire is absent from me. All pas- 
sion spent, Selig. All passion spent. 
And she too is mysteriously free of 
turbulence. I remember our last 
meeting, the look of pain on her 
face, her obsessive heap of ciga- 
rette butts. Now her expression is 
amiable and casual. We both have 
passed through the realm of 

storms. 

“You’re looking good,” I say. 
“What is it? Eight years, nine?” 



DYING INSIDE 



165 




I know the answer to that. I’m 
merely testing her. And she passes 
the test, saying, “The summer of 
’68.” I’m relieved to see that she 
hasn’t forgotten. I’m still a chapter 
of her autobiography, then. “How 
have you been, David?” 

“Not bad.” The conversational 
inanities. “What are you doing 
these days?” 

“I’m with Random House now. 
And you?” 

“Free-lancing,” I say. “Here and 
there.” Is she married? Her gloved 
hands offer no data. I don’t dare 
ask. I’m incapable of probing. 1 
force a smile and shift my weight 
from foot to foot. The silence that 
has come between us suddenly 
seems unbridgeable. 

She says, “You’ve changed.” 
“I’m older. Tireder. Balder.” 

“It isn’t that. You’ve changed 
somewhere inside.” 

“I suppose I have.” 

“You used to make me feel un- 
comfortable. I’d get a sort of 
queasy feeling. I don’t any more.” 
“You mean, after the trip?” 
“Before and after both,” she 
says. 

“You were always uncomfortable 
with me?” 

“Always. I never knew why. 
Even when we were really close 1 
felt — I don’t know, on guard, off 
balance, ill at ease, when I was 
with you. And that’s gone now. It’s 
entirely gone. I wonder why.” 
“Time heals all wounds,” I say. 
Oracular wisdom. 



“I suppose you’re right. God, it’s 
cold! Do you think it’ll snow?” 

“It’s bound to before long.” 

“1 hate the cold weather.” She 
huddles into her coat. I never knew 
her in cold weather. Spring and 
summer, then goodbye, get out, 
goodbye, goodbye. Odd how little 
I feel for her now. If she invited 
me up to her apartment I’d proba- 
bly say. No, thank you. I’m on my 
way to visit my sister. Of course 
she’s imaginary — that may have 
something to do with it. But also 
I’m not getting an aura from her. 
She’s not broadcasting — or rather 
I’m not receiving. She’s only a 
statue of herself, like the cats in 
the alleys. Will I be incapable of 
feeling now that I’m incapable of 
receiving? She says, “It’s been good 
to see you, David. Let’s get to- 
gether some time, shall we?” 

“By all means. We’ll have a drink 
and talk about old times.” 

“I’d like that.” 

“So would I. Very much.” 

“Take care of yourself, David.” 
“You too, Toni.” 

We smile. I give her a little mock- 
salute of farewell. We move apart; 
I continue walking west, she hurries 
up the windy street toward Broad- 
way. 1 feel a little warmer for hav- 
ing met her. Everything cool, 
friendly, unemotional between us. 
Everything dead, in fact. All 
passion spent. It’s been good to 
see you, David. Let’s get together 
some time, shall we? When I 
reach the corner I realize I have 



166 




forgotten to ask for her phone 
number. Toni? Toni? But she is out 
of sight. As though she never was 
there at all. 

It is the little rift within the lute. 

That by and by will make the 
music mute, 

And every widening slowly 
silence all. 

That’s Tennyson; Merlin and 
Vivien. You’ve heard that line 
about the rift within the lute before, 
haven’t you? But you never knew 
it was Tennyson. Neither did I. 
My lute is riven. Twang. Twing. 
Twong. 

Here’s another little literary 
gem: 

Every sound shall end in silence, 
but the silence never dies. 

Samuel Miller Hageman wrote 
that in 1876 in a poem called 
Silence. Have you ever heard of 
Samuel Miller Hageman before? 
I haven’t. You were a wise old cat, 
Sam, whoever you were. 

J UDITH answers the door. She 
wears an old gray sweater and 
blue slacks with a hole in the knee. 
She holds her arms out to me and I 
embrace her warmly, pulling her 
tight against my body for perhaps 
half a minute. I hear music from 
within — the Siegfried Idyll, I think. 
Sweet, loving, accepting music. 

“Is it snowing yet?” she asks. 



“Not yet. Gray and cold, that’s 
all.” 

“I’ll get you a drink. Go into 
the living room.” 

1 stand by the window. A few 
snowflakes blow by. My nephew 
appears and studies me at a dis- 
tance of thirty feet. To my amaze- 
ment he smiles. He says warmly, 
“Hi, Uncle David!” 

Judith must have put him up to 
it. Be nice to Uncle David, she must 
have said. He isn’t feeling well, he’s 
had a lot of trouble lately. So there 
the kid stands, being nice to Uncle 
David. I don’t think he’s ever 
smiled at me before. He didn’t even 
gurgle and coo at me out of his 
cradle. Hi, Uncle David. All right, 
kid. I can dig it. 

“Hello, Pauly. How have you 
been?” 

“Fine,” he says. With that his 
social graces are exhausted; he does 
not inquire in return about the state 
of my health, but picks up one of 
his toys and absorbs himself in its 
intricacies. Yet his large dark 
glossy eyes continue to examine me 
every few moments and there does 
not seem to be any hostility in his 
glance. 

Wagner ends. I prowl through 
the record racks, select one, put it 
on the turntable. Schoenberg, 
Verklaerte Nacht. M*usic of tem- 
pestuous anguish followed by calm- 
ness and resignation. The theme of 
acceptance again. Fine. Fine. The 
swirling strings enfold me. Rich, 
lush chords. Judith appears, bring- 



167 




ing me a glass of rum. She has 
something mild for herself, sherry 
or vermouth. She looks a little 
peaked but very friendly, very open. 
“Cheers,” she says. 

“Cheers.” 

“That’s good music you put on. 
A lot of people won’t believe Scho- 
enberg could be sensuous and ten- 
der. Of course it’s very early 
Schoenberg.” 

“Yes,” I say. “The romantic 
juices tend to dry up as you get 
older, eh? What have you been up 
to lately, Jude?” 

“Nothing much. A lot of the 
same old.” 

“How’s Karl?” 

“I don’t see Karl any more.” 
“Oh.” 

“Didn’t 1 tell you that?” 

“No,” 1 say. “It’s the first I’ve 
heard of it.” 

“Tm not accustomed to needing 
to tell you things, Duv.” 

“You’d better get accustomed 
to it. You and Karl — ” 

“He became very insistent about 
marrying me. I told him it was too 
soon, that I didn’t know him well 
enough, that 1 was afraid of struc- 
turing my life again when it might 
possibly be the wrong structure for 
me. He was hurt. He began lec- 
turing me about retreats from in- 
volvement and commitment, about 
self-destructiveness, a lot of stuff 
like that. I looked right at him in 
the middle of it and I flashed on 
him as a kind of father figure, you 
know, big and pompous and stern. 



not a lover but a mentor, a pro- 
fessor, and I didn’t want that. And 
I started thinking about what he’d 
be like in another ten or twelve 
years. He’d be in his sixties and 
I’d still be young. And I realized 
there was no future for us together. 
1 told him that as gently as 1 
could.” 

“I’m sorry.” 

“No need to be, Duv. 1 did the 
smart thing. I’m sure of it. Karl 
was good for me, but it couldn’t 
have been permanent. The thing 
is not to let a phase go on too long 
after you know it’s really over.” 
“Yes,” I say. “Certainly.” 
“Would you like some more 
rum?” 

“In a little while.” 

“What about you?” she asks. 
“Tell me about yourself. How 
you’re making out, now that — now 
that — ” 

“Now that my superman phase 
is over?” 

“Yes,” she says. “It’s really 
gone, eh?” 

“Really. All gone. No doubt.” 
“And so, Duv? How has it been 
for you since it happened?” 

J USTICE. You hear a lot about 
Justice, God’s justice. He look- 
eth after the righteous. He doeth 
dirt to the ungodly. Justice? 
Where’s justice? Where’s God, for 
that matter? Is He really dead, or 
merely on vacation or only absent- 
minded? Look at His justice. He 
sends a flood to Pakistan. Zap, a 



168 



GALAXY 




million people dead, the adulterer 
and the virgin both. Justice? 
Maybe. Maybe the supposedly 
innocent victims weren’t so inno- 
cent after all. Zap, the dedicated 
nun at the leprosarium gets leprosy 
and her lips fall off overnight. 
Justice. Zap, the cathedral that the 
congregation has been building for 
the past two hundred years is 
reduced to rubble by an earthquake 
the day before Easter. Zap. Zap. 
God laughs in our faces. This is 
justice? Where? How? I mean, 
consider my case. I’m not trying to 
wring pity from you now. I’m being 
purely objective. Listen, I didn’t 
ask to be a superman. It was 
handed to me at the moment of my 
conception. A mutant. God’s in- 
comprehensible whim. A whim 
that defined me, shaped me, mal- 
formed me, dislocated me, and it 
was unearned, unasked for, entirely 
undesired, unless you want to think 
of my genetic heritage in terms of 
somebody else’s bad karma, and 
crap on that. It was a random 
twitch. God said. Let this kid be a 
superman, and Lo! young Selig 
was a superman in one limited 
sense of the word. For a time, 
anyhow. God set me up for every- 
thing that happened: the isolation, 
the suffering, the loneliness, even 
the self-pity. Justice? Where? The 
Lord giveth, who the hell knoweth 
why, and the Lord taketh away. 
Which He has now done. The 
power’s gone. I’m just plain folks, 
even as you and you and you. 



Don’t misunderstand — I accept 
my fate. I’m completely reconciled 
to it, 1 am NOT asking you to feel 
sorry for me. 1 simply want to 
make a little sense out of this. Now 
that the power’s gone, who am I? 
How do I define myself now? I’ve 
lost my special thing, my power, 
my wound, my reason for apart- 
ness. All I have left now is the 
memory of having been different. 
The scars of it. What am I sup- 
posed to do now? How do I relate 
to mankind now that the difference 
is gone and I’m still here? It died. 
I live on. What a strange thing you 
did to me, God. I’m not protesting, 
you understand. I’m just asking 
things, in a quiet, reasonable tone 
of voice. I’m inquiring into the 
nature of divine justice. I think 
Goethe’s old harpist had the right 
slant on you, God. You lead us 
forth into life, you let the poor 
man fall into guilt and then you 
leave him to his misery. For all 
guilt is avenged on Earth. That’s a 
reasonable complaint. You have 
ultimate power, God, but you 
refuse to take ultimate responsi- 
bility. Is that fair? I think I have a 
reasonable complaint, too. If 
there’s justice, why does so much 
of life seem unjust? If you’re really 
on our side, God, why do you 
hand us a life of pain? Where’s 
justice for the baby born without 
eyes? The baby born with two 
heads? The baby born with a 
power men weren’t meant to have? 
Just asking, God. I accept your 



DYING INSIDE 



169 




decree, believe me, I bow to your 
will, because 1 might as well — what 
choice do 1 have, after all? But I’m 
still entitled to ask. Right? 

T he music is ending. Celestial 
harmonies filling the room. 
Everything merging into oneness. 
Snowflakes swirling beyond the 
windowpane. Right on, Schoen- 
berg. You understood, at least 
when you were young. You caught 
truth and put it on paper. 1 hear 
what you’re saying, man. Don’t 
ask questions, you say. Accept. 
Only accept, that’s the motto. 
Accept. Accept. Whatever comes 
to you, accept. 

The thing is, you have a whole 
new base to build on, Duv. When 
you had the power, the power was 
everything and you were nothing. It 
crowded you out of your own life. 
You were a superman, but you 
knew you didn’t deserve it — it was 
something handed to you by God 
knows what mixing-up of the DNA. 
And so you saw yourself as a leech, 
a bat, a parasite, a voyeur. But 
now. Stripped of the power, you’re 
nothing, right? And yet you’re 
something. You start the way every 
human being starts, as a blank 
tablet. So build, man. Make some- 
thing out of yourself. Use your 
real talents, use the things that 
David Selig still has now that the 
freaky stuff is gone. Enter the 
world for the first time. Meet man- 
kind on an equal basis. Stop beat- 



ing yourself up. You can be useful. 
Jesus, maybe you can even help 
others who were in the same mess 
you were in. To help others, Duv — 
that’s a novelty, isn’t it? 

And wholeness. To work toward 
wholeness. The sort of wholeness 
you found in that old German 
farmer, right? And even in Dean 
Cushing. You’ve been split long 
enough. Now you can be whole, 
Duv, now you can be whole. 



J UDITH says, “Claude Guer- 
mantes has invited me to go 
skiing with him in Switzerland over 
Christmas. I can leave the baby 
with a friend in Connecticut. But 
I won’t go if you need me, Duv. 
Are you okay? Can you manage?’’ 
“Sure I can. I’m not paralyzed, 
Jude. I haven’t lost my sight. Go to 
Switzerland if that’s what you 
want.” 

“I’ll only be gone eight days.” 
“I’ll survive.” 

“When 1 come back 1 hope you’ll 
move out of that housing project. 
You ought to live down here close 
to me. We should see more of each 
other.” 

“Maybe.” 

“1 might even introduce you to 
some girl friends of mine. If you’re 
interested.” 

“Wonderful, Jude.” 

“You don’t sound enthusiastic 
about it.” 

“Go easy with me,” I tell her. 
“Don’t rush me with a million

things. I need time to sort things 
out.” 

“All right. It’s like a new life, 
isn’t it, Duv?” 

“A new life. Yes. A new life, 
that’s what it is, Jude.” 



T he storm is intense now. Cars 
are vanishing under the first 
layers of whiteness. At dinnertime 
the radio weather forecaster talked 
of an accumulation of eight to ten 
inches before morning. Judith has 
invited me to spend the night here, 
in the maid’s room. Well, why not? 
Now of all times, why should I 
spurn her? I’ll stay. In the morning 
we’ll take Pauly out to the park 
with his sled. Into the new snow. 
It’s really coming down now. The 
snow is so beautiful. Covering 
everything, cleansing everything, 
briefly purifying this tired eroded 
city and its tired eroded people. I 
can’t take my eyes from it. My face 
is close to the window. I hold a 
brandy snifter in one hand, but 1 
don’t remember to drink from it. 
The snow has caught me in a hyp- 
notic spell. 

“Boo]” someone cries behind me. 
1 jump so violently that the co- 
gnac leaps from the snifter and 
splashes the window. In terror I 
whirl, crouching, ready to defend 
myself — then the instinctive fear 
subsides and I laugh. Judith laughs, 
too. 

“That’s the first time I’ve ever 
surprised you,” she says. “In 



thirty-one years, the first time!” 

“You gave me one hell of a 
jolt.” 

“I’ve been standing here for 
three or four minutes thinking 
things at you. Trying to get a rise 
out of you, but no, no, you didn’t 
react, you just went on staring at 
the snow. So I sneaked up and 
yelled in your ear. You were really 
startled, Duv. You weren’t faking 
at all.” 

“Did you think I was lying to you 
about what had happened to me?” 

“No, of course not.” 

“Then why’d you think I’d be 
faking?” 

“I don’t know. I guess I doubted 
you just a little. 1 don’t any more. 
Oh, Duv, Duv, I feel so sad for 
you!” 

“Don’t,” 1 say. “Please, Jude.” 

She is crying softly. How strange 
that is, to watch Judith cry. For 
love of me, no less. For love of me. 

It’S very quiet now. 

The world is white outside and 
gray within. I accept that. I think 
life will be more peaceful. Silence 
will become my mother tongue. 
There will be discoveries and reve- 
lations, but no upheavals. Perhaps 
some color will cotne back into the 
world for me, later on. Perhaps. 

Living, we fret. Dying, we live. 
I’ll keep that in mind. I’ll be of 
good cheer. Twang. Twing. Twong.

hello. ★ 



DYING INSIDE

Directions: 

This is in direct response to Cy 
Chauvin's letter in the March '72 
Galaxy. Science fiction doesn't "have 
a purpose." Writers have purposes. 
Editors and publishers have purposes. 
Readers have purposes. An editor or 
publisher may have the purpose of 
advancing a certain genre (as does a 
fan or a fan club). It is advantageous 
and proper to label a product so that 
the customer knows what he is buying. 
Thus Theodore Sturgeon’s Slow Sculp- 
ture, for instance, would have been 
properly turned down by a mystery 
magazine. 

A writer may consider himself a 
"hack" — that is, he may feel that his 
main purpose is to sell his material 
and earn a living. If so, it suits his 
purposes to understand the sales 
package, to submit "science fiction" 
(whatever that is — I've been reading 
it since 1942 and haven't found a 
definition I like for more than six 
months) to “science fiction markets." 
If his story utilizes the science fction 
elements as "merely an incidental bit 
of background" this may be simply 
an attempt to aim the story at a mar- 
ket. It is up to the editor or publisher 



to decide whether this is in fact true and 
if the story is up to total standards to 
purchase it despite this background. 
As a reader I would prefer a good story 
with "incidental" science fction ele- 
ments to a poor story that is "intrin- 
sically science fction. " 

The person who defines himself as 
a writer must find out what he has to 
say and what medium best suits that 
"saying." An example: I was once in 
a play-writing class under a great 
teacher. I was able to "hack" it — 
write plays that met the technical 
specifications, followed the pattern 
of plays. They were plays — not very 
good ones. The teacher’s reaction was 
to say to me: "You have the needed 
technical skills, but you also have 
something to say. And what you have 
to say is not the size or shape of a 
play. What you want to say is the size 
and shape of a novel. You may be a 
novelist -but don't run out and start 
writing novels. You won't be mature 
enough to write the novel you are trying 
to write until you're in your forties." 

The point here is not whether I will 
ever be a novelist. The point is that 
this man, dedicated to plays, didn't 
say, "You don't fully exploit the 
medium of the play." He said, "You 
meet the technical requirements. ." 

To go back to my starting point — 
the question of whether science fction 
has "a purpose." 

It is an amorphous area of writing 
in which it suits certain writers to 
function, for which there is a specif c 
market and which serves certain in- 
terest groups (fans, publishers, editors) 
who wish to keep that market separate 
and discrete from other markets. 
Hence, in reviewing a product — movie, 
book, etc. — labeled "science fction," 
it is legitimate to say, “This is not sf." 



172 




or, "The sf in this work is incidental." 
However, it is also legitimate to say 
that this (book, movie, TV program! 
which is or is not labeled "science 
fiction" is of such quality or nature 
that it would or would not interest 
science-fwtion readers. 

/ wouldn't worry about whether sf 
has or has not a purpose. Writers have 
been able to do things within the vague 
outline of the medium that cannot be 
done within any other genre. Some- 
times a writer can use science-fiction 
effects in another medium — and vice 
versa. Sometimes a rock concert can 
do something that people used to think 
only classical forms could do — the very- 
term "rock concert" suggests as much 
— so media and their interpretations 
change, readers change, writers 
change. They may change so much that 
science fiction will merge into other 
media. 

What has happened is that the 
boundaries of sf have changed. They 
probably will remain fluid. We do not 
accept the old-style Buck Rogers space 
opera as "hard core sf." We do admit 
fantasy. And sex. And "New Wave" 
writing. But we still haven't reached 
the limits of what can be done uniquely 
within science fiction. I think we have 
passed the peak of sociological explora- 
tions, utopias or anti anti-utopias, if 
you will. But there hasn't been much 
sf that truly uses psychology — that 
explores people really built the way 
Freud said they were or that digs into 
Jung's or Rogers' theories, creating 
really “other" aliens. 

We've gotten into theology a bit 
(I think some of those priestly drop- 
outs may have picked up a buck or two 
here and there) but we haven't gotten 
into black theology — which might 
give V hites an insight into men (crit- 



ters! of other races. 

We've got some people whom other 
people think nonhuman. I have not 
seen one science-fiction story treat 
aliens the way we treat the Vietnamese. 
I have read one science-fiction situa- 
tion analogous to that of the school 
principal in Chicago who could not get 
a person from the city Department of 
Health to test his kindergarteners for 
lead poisoning, even though they came 
from a population (urban poor! known 
to suffer from that affliction — and the 
affliction is known to be permanant 
if not treated early and to defeat the 
whole purpose of having the kids in 
school (they gel stupid, baby, really). 
If I placed that story on Mars or the 
planet Ogacihc, you'd say, "Well 
written, but unbelievable. People 
wouldn't act that stupidly or cruelly." 
So we haven't touched man's inhuman- 
ity to man, let alone his inhumanity 
to alien. 

Incidentally, why do we so often 
expect the alien ( whether Martian or a 
black! to be morally "superior" to us— 
always on our (the dominant race's! 
terms. Do we confuse moral superiority 
with weakness? Are all whites blue- 
eyed devils as the Prophet says? Maybe 
we can explore these ideas in science 
fiction — we can't in mainstream, you 
know. The alien is mystical or good, 
rejects the nasty technology we wallow 
in. Read G. B. Shaw's Don Juan in 
Hell and note where he describes the 
arts of peace confined to "machinery 
of peace a greedy dog could define. 
but ". .death, they wallow in it." 
Maybe we aren't so bad (how's that 
for heretical thought?!. Maybe .some 
aliens are worse. 

Mark Twain fully explored the alien 
who considers us amusing ants. fVe 
often see the alien who does not con-

sider us at all. What about the alien 
who sees us as we see the Vietnamese? 
Or the goldfish? / saw some — imported 
from China — with big bubble eyes and 
distorted shaggy bodies. I thought 
them beautiful — what would my gold- 
fish think? 

What about an alien civilization that 
valued us for our sense of rhythm? For 
the way we played the banjo? For our 
peculiar color? Could we invent codes 
like the spirituals to communicate? 
Yes, Fm aware that this is explored in 
the C'mell series — is this science fic- 
tion? Could it he done better as a realis- 
tic novel set in 1972 in Chicago? 

The answer, of course, is no. 

For me science fiction is a medium 
than can introduce problems and di- 
lemmas of the time and culture in 
which it is written in an imaginative 
way that can be published and con- 
sidered by a larger audience than in the 
mainstream. I am currently writing 
essays on black theology, which may 
be published in journals and read by a 
handful. The C’mell series or a story 
(should / be successful in writing and 
selling it) would reach a larger audience 
to consider the same problems in a 
wider frame.

Directions: 

Re Cy Chauvin's letter in March "72 
Directions: in your efforts to categorize 
you have forgotten the purpose of 
science fiction — to outline change. If 
an author can fulfill this purpose by 



putting the science fiction in shadow 
instead of the limelight he is still cre- 
ating a science-fiction story. 

What is a “genre requirement?" Is 
it a yardstick to measure a good story 
versus a bad story? If so, from whose 
side do we measure — and is the yard- 
stick always constant? 

What are “mainstream effects?" In 
fiction the principal effect is the 
emotion engendered. When we object 
to mainstream effects in science fiction 
do we mean that human emotions are 
only allowable in a Redbook novel or 
a New York Times Book of the Year? 
Perhaps Cy means technique, which 
brings up a different point. Let’s 
imagine two artists. One uses his three 
colors and a §2 brush to paint a pain- 
stakingly detailed portrait. His brother 
artist will use the same materials and 
produce an abstract image of the same 
subject. Each uses the same brush and 
the same colors, but each finishes 
with a different picture. What has 
been borrowed — and by whom? 

Cy wants authors “fully to exploit 
their (stories’) .science-fiction potential. 
A story’s potential is different for 
every reader. I agree that some stories 
could be developed more completely 
and some could be cut in half and still 
say what they have to say. But to 
question a story for not cleanly fitting 
into a personally defined category is 
trying to make a hampering order out 
of the chaos of creation. 

Good music by any name is good 
music.

Isaac Asimov’s newest book is 
“a must”* for anyone interested in 
science - or anyone terrified by it. 



"There is no doubi lhal Isaac Asimov 
is the finest popular science writer working 

today . prolific, encyclopedic witty, with a 

gift for colorful and illuminating examples 
and explanations,"* 

In his latest work. Asimov's Guide to 
Science, he tells us of pulsars, magma, black ^ 
holes, quarks, clones, the surface of Mars and Ihe^^ 
shifting of the continents — of the fascinating world of 
and the challenging world of tomorrow — "with clarity, 
with charm, (and) with calm.”* 

Acclaimed in its earlier edition as "the most exciting . , 
general account. .of modern science,"t this encyclopedic work 
is meant to be read and enjoyed. In nontechnical language, 
it offers a comprehensive picture of the whole of modern 
science. Dr. Asimov tells what has been learned of 
the earth and its atmosphere and the space beyond; the 
nature of matter and the atom; the natural laws and 
phenomena that have shaped our technology; the living cell 
and the chemistry of life; the biological heritage of mankind: 
the human brain and human behavior. 

"Isaac Asimov is one of the rare ones," writes Nobel 
Prize winner George W. Beadle. "He knows and 
understands science in both its history and 
its substance, and he writes about 
it simply, clearly, and with 
infectious enthusiasm."
