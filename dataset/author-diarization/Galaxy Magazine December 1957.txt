Control Pond of GENIAC 
sot op to do a problem 
In space ship engineering 




Be careful before you answer. 
GENIAC the first electrical brain 
construction kit is equipped to play 
tic-tac-toe, cipher and encipher codes, 
convert from binary to decimal, rea- 
son in syllogisms, as well as add, sub- 
tract, multiply and divide. Specific 
problems in a variety of fields — ac- 
tuarial, policy claim settlement, phys- 
ics, etc., can be set up and solved 
with the components. Connections are 
solderless and are completely ex- 
plained with templates in the manual. 
This covers 33 circuits and shows 
how new ones can be designed. 

You will find building and using 
GENIACS a wonderful experience; 
one kit user wrote us: “this kit has 
opened up a new world of thinking 
to me." You actually see how com- 
puting, problem solving, and game 
play (Tic-tac-toe, nim, etc.) can be 
analyzed with Boolean Algebra and 
the algebraic solutions transformed 
directly into circuit diagrams. You 
create from over 400 specially de- 
signed and manufactured compo- 
nents a machine that solves prob- 
lems faster than you can express 
them. 

Schools and colleges, teachers of 



science or math, engineering, phi- 
losophy or psychology will find these 
excellent demonstrators of circuitry, 
solutions in symbolic logic, theory of 
numbers, cybernetics, and automa- 
tion. 

Note: Teachers take advantage of 
our 10% discount to educational in- 
situations and for group purchases.

THE ROUNDEST TRIP 



IN India, in the village of Na- 
-*■ makkal, near Madras, there is 
a shrine to the goddess Nama- 
giri. About 70 years ago, the 
father-in-law of a Brahman ac- 
countant went to that shrine to 
pray that his daughter would have 
a child. 

I don’t know whether the prayer 
had anything to do with it, but 
the couple did have a son not long 
after. And two decades later, that 
son asked the help of someone to 
write this letter to G. H. Hardy 
at Trinity College, Cambridge, 
England : 

dear sir: 

I beg to introduce myself to you 
as a clerk in the Accounts Depart- 
ment of the Port Trust Office at 
Madras on a salary of only £20 per 
annum. I am now about 23 years of 
age. I have had no University edu- 
cation but I have undergone the 
ordinary school course ... I would 
request you to go through the en- 
closed papers. 

The “enclosed papers” were 120 
mathematical theorems, and the 
name signed to the letter was “S. 
Ramanujan.” 

I wonder what G. H. Hardy 
made of those 120 theorems when 
he first looked at them, for Hardy 
was, though a Trinity Fellow, a 



very unconventional fellow — he 
called God his personal enemy; he 
was surely the only English mathe- 
matician of standing to root for 
the Boston Red Sox; and he went 
to his death proudly boasting that 
nothing he had done would ever 
benefit a single human being (he 
was wrong— a paper of his sup- 
plied the clue that made it pos- 
sible to keep Rh-negative babies 
alive). 

Unconventional or not, however, 
a Trinity Fellow doesn’t expect to 
find anything of much value in a 
babu-English letter from an of- 
fice clerk. 

Surprise for Mr. Hardy: “The 
first question was whether I would 
recognize anything,” he wrote af- 
terward. That was the surprise. He 
did. Theorem 1.8, for instance- 
why, LaPlace had discovered that. 
Others— only a man like Hardy 
could even recognize them— 
cropped up in the work of Rogers, 
Bauer and other men. Still others 
—they “defeated me completely,” 
Hardy admitted; he couldn’t recog- 
nize them, he couldn’t prove them, 
he couldn’t even make sense out 
of them. 

But one thing was sure: “They 
must be true because, if they were 
not true, no one would have had

the imagination to invent them . 
The writer must be completely 
honest, because great mathemati- 
cians are commoner than thieves 
or humbugs of such incredible 
skill.” 

Amazing Ramanujan! He had 
taught himself math out of one 
borrowed book, and now he was 
confounding the experts! He was 
not an impressive person: “a short 
uncouth figure, stout, unshaved, 
not overclean.” He had neither de- 
grees nor scholastic records. And 
yet here was a brain chained by 
India’s awful poverty, and he 
couldn’t help himself— he emitted 
mathematics as another might emit 
perspiration. 

What he did was on that rare- 
fied level that mathematicians des- 
pair of explaining to laymen; it 
had to do with the congruence 
properties of partitions, transfor- 
mations of infinite series and the 
eclectic like. Numbers were his 
friends (he had few others). Once, 
in a taxi, someone pointed out the 
car’s number— 1729— and said it 
was a dull one. “No,” said Rama- 
nujan, “it is a very interesting 
number; it is the smallest number 
expressible as a sum of two cubes 
in two different ways.” 

He was a vegetarian; he insisted 
on cooking his own food, and he 
always changed into pajamas be- 
fore cooking. And, like his grand- 
father, he prayed to the goddess 

6 



Namagiri for help with his math. 
He died when he was 33. His 
prayers were answered, for his pa- 
pers are still of basic importance 
in a dozen fields— but if he’d lived, 
he would be only 70 now, and 
what might he not have dis- 
covered? 

All this and much more I got 
from an overwhelming kind of 
book published by Simon & Schus- 
ter. The name of it is The World 
of Mathematics and it comes in 
four volumes, boxed, more than 
2,500 stunning pages. Besides 
chapters on every sort of math 
proper, there are biographies of 
the greatest mathematicians, from 
Ah-mose, the Egyptian scribe, to 
the present day— the flyleaf of the 
book says “To Einstein,” but it 
goes beyond him. 

If time travel existed, I can 
think of few worthier— or more 
predictably successful— uses than 
to send this book back half a cen- 
tury to the lonely, unlovely genius 
of Madras. The world would bene- 
fit beyond imagination— and so 
would he, for he’d have found 
friends not only in symbols, but 
also in mathematical fiction by 
G. B. Shaw, Lewis Carroll, Aldous 
Huxley, Stephen Leacock, Jona- 
than Swift and many more. 

Poor Ramanujan! A brain like 
that and a book like The World 
of Mathematics— what couldn’t a 
combination of that sort produce!

The Three Laws of Posit ronic Robots made it 
impossible to kill a human, but there was a 
loophole . murdering a man after his death I 




Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



T HE United States Robot 
and Mechanical Men, Inc., 
as defendants in the case, 
had influence enough to force a 
closed-doors trial without a jury. 

Nor did Northeastern University 
try hard to prevent it. The trus- 
tees knew perfectly well how the 
public might react to any issue in- 
volving misbehavior of a robot, 
however rarefied that misbehavior 
might be. They also had a clearly 
visualized notion of how an anti- 
robot riot might become an anti- 
science riot without warning. 

The government, as represented 
in this case by Justice Harlow 
Shane, was equally anxious for a 
quiet end to this mess. Both U. S. 
Robots and the academic world

were bad people to antagonize. 

Justice Shane said, “Since 
neither press, public nor jury is 
present, gentlemen, let us stand 
on as little ceremony as we can 
and get to the facts.” 

He smiled stiffly as he said 
this, perhaps without much hope 
that his request would be effective, 
and hitched at his robe so that he 
might sit more comfortably. His 
face was pleasantly rubicund, his 
chin round and soft, his nose broad 
and his eyes light in color and 
wide-set. All in all, it was not a 
face with much judicial majesty 
and the judge knew it 

Barnabas H. Goodfellow, Pro- 
fessor of Physics at Northeastern 
U., was sworn in first, taking the 
usual vow with an expression that 
made mincemeat of his name. 

After the usual opening-gambit 
questions, Prosecution shoved his 
hands deep into his pockets and 
said, “When was it, Professor, that 
the matter of the possible employ 
of Robot EZ-27 was first brought 
to your attention, and how?” 
Professor Goodfellow’s small 
and angular face set itself into an 
uneasy expression, scarcely more 
benevolent than the one it re- 
placed. He said, “I have had pro- 
fessional contact and some social 
acquaintance with Dr. Alfred Lan- 
ning, Director of Research at U. S. 
Robots. I was inclined to listen 
with some tolerance then when I 
received a rather strange sugges- 



tion from him on the 3rd of March 
of last year—” 

“Of 2033?” 

“That’s right” 

“Excuse me for interrupting. 
Please proceed.” 

The professor nodded frostily, 
scowled to fix the facts in his mind, 
and began to speak. 

OROFESSOR Goodfellow 
looked at the robot with a cer- 
tain uneasiness. It had been car- 
ried into the basement supply 
room in a crate, in accordance with 
the regulations governing the ship- 
ment of robots from place to place 
on the Earth’s surface. 

He knew it was coming; it 
wasn’t that he was unprepared. 
From the moment of Dr. Lanning’s 
first phone call on March 3, he 
had felt himself giving way to the 
other’s persuasiveness, and now, as 
an inevitable result, he found him- 
self face to face with a robot 
It looked uncommonly large as 
it stood within arm’s reach. 

Alfred Lanning cast a hard 
glance of his own at the robot, as 
though making certain it had not 
been damaged in transit Then he 
turned his ferocious eyebrows and 
his mane of white hair in the pro- 
fessor’s direction. 

“This is Robot EZ-27, first of 
its model to be available for pub- 
lic use.” He turned to the robot 
“This is Professor Goodfellow, 
Easy.” 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Easy spoke impassively, but 
with such suddenness that the pro- 
fessor shied. “Good afternoon, Pro- 
fessor.” 

Easy stood seven feet tall and 
had the general proportions of a 
man — always the prime selling 
point of U. S. Robots. That and 
the possession of the basic patents 
on the positronic brain had given 
them an actual monopoly on ro- 
bots and a near-monopoly on com- 
puting machines in general. 

The two men who had uncrated 
the robot had left now and the 
professor looked from Lanning to 
the robot and back to Lanning. “It 
is harmless, I’m sure.” He didn’t 
sound sure. 

“More harmless than I am,” said 
Lanning. “I could be goaded into 
striking you. Easy could not be. 
You know the Three Laws of Ro- 
botics, I presume.” 

“Yes, of course,” said Goodfel- 
low. 

“They are built into the posi- 
tronic patterns of the brain and 
must be observed. The First Law, 
the prime rule of robotic existence, 
safeguards the life and well-being 
of all humans.” He paused, rubbed 
at his cheek, then added, “It’s 
something of which we would like 
to persuade all Earth if we could.” 

“It’s just that he seems formid- 
able.” 

“Granted. But whatever he 
seems, you’ll find that he is useful.” 

“I’m not sure in what way. Our 



conversations were not very help- 
ful in that respect Still, I agreed 
to look at the object and I’m do- 
ing it” 

“Well do more than look, Pro- 
fessor. Have you brought a book?” 
“I have.” 

“May I see it?” 

Professor Goodfellow reached 
down without actually taking his 
eyes off the metal-in-human-shape 
that confronted him. From the 
briefcase at his feet, he withdrew 
a book. 

Lanning held out his hand for it 
and looked at the backstrip. “ Phy- 
sical Chemistry of Electrolytes in 
Solution. Fair enough, sir. You se- 
lected this yourself, at random. It 
was no suggestion of mine, this 
particular text. Am I right?” 

“Yes.” 

Lanning passed the book to Ro- 
bot EZ-27. 

r ■ ''HE professor jumped a little. 

“No! That’s a valuable book!” 
Lanning raised his eyebrows and 
they looked like shaggy coconut 
icing. He said, “Easy has no in- 
tention of tearing the book in two 
as a feat of strength, I assure you. 
It can handle a book as carefully 
as you or I. Go ahead, Easy.” 
“Thank you, sir,” said Easy. 
Then, turning its metal bulk slight- 
ly, it added, “With your permis- 
sion, Professor Goodfellow.” 

The professor stared, then said, 
“Yes— yes, of course.” 



GALLEY SLAVE 



11 




With a slow and steady manipu- 
lation of metal fingers, Easy turned 
the pages of the book, glancing at 
the left page, then the right; turn- 
ing the page, glancing left, then 
right; turning the page and so on 
for minute after minut£. 

The sense of its power seemed 
to dwarf even the large cement- 
walled room in which they stood 
and to reduce the two human 
watchers to something consider- 
ably less than life-size. 

Goodfellow muttered, “The light 
isn’t very good.” 

“It will do.” 

Then, rather more sharply, “But 
what is he doing?” 

“Patience, sir.” 

The last page was turned even- 
tually. Lanning asked, “Well, 
Easy?” 

The robot said, “It is a most ac- 
curate book and there is little to 
which I can point On line 22 of 
page 27, the word ‘positive’ is 
spelled p-o-i-s-t-i-v-e. The comma 
in line 6 of page 32 is superfluous, 
whereas one should have been used 
on line 13 of page 54. The plus 
sign in equation XIV-2 on page 
337 should be a minus sign if it 
is to be consistent with the previ- 
ous equations—” 

“Wait! Wait!” cried the profes- 
sor. “What is he doing?” 

“Doing?” echoed Lanning in 
sudden irascibility. “Why, man, he 
has already done it! He has proof- 
read that book.” 



“Proofread it?” 

“Yes. In the short time it took 
him to turn those pages, he caught 
every mistake in spelling, gram- 
mar and punctuation. He has noted 
errors in word order and detected 
inconsistencies. And he will retain 
the information, letter-perfect, in- 
definitely.” 

The professor’s mouth was open. 
He walked rapidly away from 
Lanning and Easy and as rapidly 
back. He folded his arms across 
his chest and stared at them. Fi- 
nally he said, “You mean this is a 
proofreading robot?” 

Lanning nodded. “Among other 
things.” 

“But why do you show it to 
me?” 

“So that you might help me per- 
suade the university to obtain it 
for use.” 

“To read proof?” 

“Among other things,” Lanning 
repeated patiently. 

The professor drew his pinched 
face together in a kind of sour dis- 
belief. “But this is ridiculous!” 

“Why?” 

“The university could never af- 
ford to buy this half-ton— it must 
weigh that at least— this half-ton 
proofreader.” 

“Proofreading is not all it will 
do. It will prepare reports from 
outlines, fill out forms, serve as an 
accurate memory-file, grade pa- 
pers—” 

“All picayune!” 



12 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




T ANNING said, “Not at all, as 
I can show you in a moment. 
But I think we can discuss this 
more comfortably in your office, if 
you have no objection” 

“No, of course not,” began the 
professor mechanically and took a 
half-step as though to turn. Then 
he snapped out, “But the robot— we 
can’t take the robot. Really, Doc- 
tor, you’ll have to crate it up 
again.” 

“Time enough. We can leave 
Easy here.” 

“Unattended?” 

“Why not? He knows he is to 
stay. Professor Goodfellow, it is 
necessary to understand that a ro- 
bot is far more reliable than a hu- 
man being.” 

“I would be responsible for any 
damage—” 

“There will be no damage. I 
guarantee that. Look, it’s after 
hours. You expect no one here, I 
imagine, before tomorrow morning. 
The truck and my two men are 
outside. U. S. Robots will take any 
responsibility that may arise. None 
will. Call it a demonstration of the 
reliability of the robot.” 

The professor allowed himself 
to be led out of the storeroom. 
Nor did he look entirely comfort- 
able in his own office, five stories 
up. 

He dabbed at the line of drop- 
lets along the upper half of his 
forehead with a white handker- 
chief.

“As you know very well, Dr. 
Lanning, there are laws against 
the use of robots on Earth’s sur- 
face,” he pointed out. 

“The laws, Professor Goodfel- 
low, are not simple ones. Robots 
may not be used on public 
thoroughfares or within public edi- 
fices. They may not be used on 
private grounds or within private 
structures except under certain re- 
strictions that usually turn out to 
be prohibitive. The university, 
however, is a large and privately 
owned institution that usually re- 
ceives preferential treatment. If 
the robot is used only in a speci- 
fic room for only academic pur- 
poses, if certain other restrictions 
are observed and if the men and 
women having occasion to enter 
the room cooperate fully, we may 
remain within the law.” 

“But all that trouble just to read 
proof?” 

“The uses would be infinite, Pro- 
fessor. Robotic labor has so far 
been used only to relieve physical 
drudgery. Isn’t there such a thing 
as mental drudgery? When a pro- 
fessor capable of the most useful 
creative thought is forced to spend 
two weeks painfully checking the 
spelling of lines of print and I of- 
fer you a machine that can do it 
in thirty minutes, is that pica- 
yune?” 

“But the price—” 

“The price need not bother you. 
You cannot buy EZ-27. U. S. Ro- 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




bots does not sell its products. But 
the university can lease EZ-27 for 
a thousand dollars a year— consid- 
erably less than the cost of a single 
micro-wave spectograph continu- 
ous-recording attachment.” 

Goodfellow looked stunned. 
Lanning followed up his advan- 
tage by saying, “I only ask that 
you put it up to whatever group 
makes the decisions here. I would 
be glad to speak to them if they 
want more information.” 

“Well,” Goodfellow said doubt- 
fully, “I can bring it up at next 
week’s Senate meeting. I can’t 
promise that will do any good, 
though.” 

“Naturally,” said Lanning. 

r I^ HE Defense Attorney was 
-*• short and stubby and carried 
himself rather portentously, a 
stance that had the effect of ac- 
centuating his double chin. He 
stared at Professor Goodfellow, 
once that witness had been handed 
over, and said, “You agreed rather 
readily, did you not?” 

The Professor said briskly, “I 
suppose I was anxious to be rid of 
Dr. Lanning. I would have agreed 
to anything.” 

“With the intention of forgetting 
about it after he left?” 

“Well-” 

“Nevertheless, you did present 
the matter to a meeting of the 
Executive Board of the University 
Senate.” 



“Yes, I did ” 

“So that you agreed in good 
faith with Dr. Lanning’s sugges- 
tions. You weren’t just going along 
with a gag. You actually agreed 
enthusiastically, did you not?” 

“I merely followed ordinary 
procedures.” 

“As a matter of fact, you weren’t 
as upset about the robot as you 
now claim you were. You know 
the Three Laws of Robotics and 
you knew them at the time of your 
interview with Dr. Lanning.” , 

“Well, yes.” 

“And you were perfectly willing 
to leave a robot at large and un- 
attended.” 

“Dr. Lanning assured me—” 

“Surely you would never have 
accepted his assurance if you had 
had the slightest doubt that the 
robot might be in the least dan- 
gerous.” 

The professor began frigidly, “I 
had every faith in the word—” 

“That is all,” said Defense ab- 
ruptly. 

As Professor Goodfellow, more 
than a bit ruffled, stood down, Jus- 
tice Shane leaned forward and 
said, “Since I am not a robotics 
man myself, I would appreciate 
knowing precisely what the Three 
Laws of Robotics are. Would Dr. 
Lanning quote them for the bene- 
fit of the court?” 

Dr. Lanning looked startled. He 
had been virtually bumping heads 
with the gray-haired woman at his 



GALLEY SLAVE 



15 




side. He rose to his feet now and 
the woman looked up, too— ex- 
pressionlessly. 

Dr. Lanning said, “Very well, 
Your Honor.” He paused as 
though about to launch into an 
oration and said, with laborious 
clarity, “First Law: a robot may 
not injure a human being, or, 
through inaction, allow a human 
being to come to harm. Second 
Law: a robot must obey the or- 
ders given it by human beings, 
except where such orders would 
conflict with the First Law. Third 
Law: a robot must protect its own 
existence as long as such protec- 
tion does not conflict with the First 
or Second Laws.” 

“I see,” said the judge, taking 
rapid notes. “These Laws are built 
into every robot, are they?” 

“Into every one. That will be 
borne out by any roboticist.” 

“And into Robot EZ-27 speci- 
fically?” 

“Yes, Your Honor.” 

“You will probably be required 
to repeat those statements under 
oath.” 

“I am ready to do so, Your 
Honor.” 

He sat down again. 

T\R. Susan Calvin, robopsycholo- 
gist-in-chief for U. S. Robots, 
who was the gray-haired woman 
sitting next to Lanning, looked at 
her titular superior without favor, 
but then she showed favor to no 



human being. She said, “Was 
Goodfellow’s testimony accurate, 
Alfred?” 

“Essentially, ” muttered Lanning. 
“He wasn’t as nervous as all that 
about the robot and he was anxious 
enough to talk business with me 
when he heard the price. But there 
doesn’t seem to be any drastic 
distortion.” 

Dr. Calvin said thoughtfully, “It 
might have been wise to put the 
price higher than a thousand.” 
“We were anxious to place 
E^asy.” 

“I know. Too anxious, perhaps. 
They’ll try to make it look as 
though we had an ulterior motive ” 
Lanning looked exasperated. 
“We did. I admitted that at the 
University Senate meeting.” 
“They can make it look as if we 
had one beyond the one we ad- 
mitted.” 

Scott Robertson, son of the 
founder of U. S. Robots and still 
owner of a majority of the stock, 
leaned over from Dr. Calvin’s 
other side and said in a kind of 
explosive whisper, “Why can’t you 
get Elasy to talk so we’ll know 
where we’re at?” 

“You know he can’t talk about 
it, Mr. Robertson.” 

“Make him. You’re the psy- 
chologist, Dr. Calvin. Make him.” 
“If I’m the psychologist, Mr. 
Robertson,” said Susan Calvin 
coldly, “let me make the decisions. 
My robot will not be made to do 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




anything at the price of his well- 
being” 

Robertson frowned and might 
have answered, but Justice Shane 
was tapping his gavel in a polite 
sort of way and they grudgingly 
fell silent. 

Francis J. Hart, head of the De- 
partment of English and Dean of 
Graduate Studies, was on the 
stand. He was a plump man, 
meticulously dressed in dark cloth- 
ing of a conservative cut, and pos- 
sessing several strands of hair 
traversing the pink top of his 
cranium. He sat well back in the 
witness chair with his hands folded 
neatly in his lap and displaying, 
from time to time, a tight-lipped 
smile. 

He said, “My first connection 
with the matter of the Robot EZ- 
27 was on the occasion of the ses- 
sion of the University Senate 
Executive Committee at which the 
subject was introduced by Pro- 
fessor Goodfellow. Thereafter, on 
the 10th of April of last year, we 
held a special meeting on the sub- 
ject, during which I was in the 
chair.” 

“Were minutes kept of the meet- 
ing of the Executive Committee? 
Of the special meeting, that is?” 

“Well, no. It was a rather un- 
usual meeting.” The dean smiled 
briefly. “We thought it might re- 
main confidential.” 

“What transpired at the meet- 
ing?” 



T\EAN Hart was not entirely 
comfortable as chairman of 
that meeting. Nor did the other 
members assembled seem com- 
pletely calm. Only Dr. banning 
appeared at peace with himself. 
His tall, gaunt figure and the 
shock of white hair that crowned 
him reminded Hart of portraits he 
had seen of Andrew Jackson. 

Samples of the robot’s work 
lay scattered along the central 
regions of the table and the repro- 
duction of a graph drawn by the 
robot was now in the hands of 
Professor Minott of Physical 
Chemistry. The chemist’s lips were 
pursed in obvious approval. 

Hart cleared his throat and said, 
“There seems no doubt that the 
robot can perform certain routine 
tasks with adequate competence. I 
have gone over these, for instance, 
just before coming in and there is 
very little to find fault with.” 

He picked Up a long sheet of 
printing, some three times as long 
as the average book page. It was 
a sheet of galley proof, designed to 
be corrected by authors before the 
type was set up in page form. 
Along both of the wide margins 
of the galley were proofmarks, 
neat and superbly legible. Occa- 
sionally, a word of print was 
crossed out and a new word sub- 
stituted in the margin in characters 
so fine and regular it might easily 
have been print itself. Some of the 
corrections were blue to indicate 



GALLEY SLAVE 



17 




the original mistake had been the 
author’s, a few in red, where the 
printer had been wrong. 

“Actually,” said Lanning, “there 
is less than very little to find fault 
with. I should say there is nothing 
at all to find fault with, Dr. Hart. 
I’m sure the corrections are per- 
fect, insofar as the original manu- 
script was. If the manuscript 
against which this galley was cor- 
rected was at fault in a matter of 
fact rather than of English, the 
robot is not competent to correct 
it.” 

“We accept that. However, the 
robot corrected word order on oc- 
casion and I don’t think the rules 
of English are sufficiently hide- 
bound for us to be sure that in 
each case the robot’s choice was 
the correct one.” 

“Easy’s positronic brain,” said 
Lanning, showing large teeth as 
he smiled, “has been molded by 
the contents of all the standard 
works on the subject I’m sure you 
cannot point to a case where the 
robot’s choice was definitely the 
incorrect one.” 

Professor Minott looked up 
from the graph he still held. “The 
question in my mind, Dr. Lanning, 
is why we need a robot at all, with 
all the difficulties in public rela- 
tions that would entail. The sci- 
ence of automation has surely 
reached the point where your com- 
pany could design a machine, an 
ordinary computer of a type 



known and accepted by the public, 
that would correct galleys.” 

“I am sure we could,” said Lan- 
ning stiffly, “but such a machine 
would require that the galleys be 
translated into special symbols or, 
at the least, transcribed on tapes. 
Any corrections would emerge in 
symbols. You would need to keep 
men employed translating words 
to symbols, symbols to words. Fur- 
thermore, such a computer could 
do no other job. It couldn’t pre- 
pare the graph you hold in your 
hand, for instance.” 

Minott grunted. 

T ANNING went on. “The hall- 
mark of the positronic robot is 
its flexibility. It can do a num- 
ber of jobs. It is designed like a 
man so that it can use all the tools 
and machines that have, after all, 
been designed to be used by a 
man. It can talk to you and you 
can talk to it. You can actually 
reason with it up to a point. Com- 
pared to even a simple robot, an 
ordinary computer with a non-posi- 
tronic brain is only a heavy add- 
ing machine.” 

Goodfellow looked up and said, 
“If we all talk and reason with the 
robot, what are the chances of our 
confusing it? I suppose it doesn’t 
have the capability of absorbing 
an infinite amount of data.” 

“No, it hasn’t But it should last 
five years with ordinary use. It will 
know when it will require clearing. 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and the company will do the job 
without charge.” 

“The company will?” 

“Yes. The company reserves the 
right to service the robot outside 
the ordinary course of its duties. 
It is one reason we retain control 
of our positronic robots and lease 
rather than sell them. In the pur- 
suit of its ordinary functions, any 
robot can be directed by any man. 
Outside its ordinary functions, a 
robot requires expert handling, and 
that we can give it. For instance, 
any of you might clear an EZ 
robot to an extent by telling it to 
forget this item or that. But you 
would be almost certain to phrase 
the order in such a way as to cause 
it to forget too much or too little. 
We would detect such tampering, 
because we have built-in safe- 
guards. However, since there is no 
need for clearing the robot in its 
ordinary work, or for doing other 
useless things, this raises no prob- 
lem.” 

"TkEAN Hart touched his head 
as though to make sure his 
carefully cultivated strands lay 
evenly distributed and said, “You 
are anxious to have us take the 
machine. Yet surely it is a los- 
ing proposition for U. S. Robots. 
One thousand a year is a ridicu- 
lously low price. Is it that you hope 
through this to rent other such ma- 
chines to other universities at a 
more reasonable price?” 



“Certainly that’s a fair hope,” 
said Lanning. 

“But even so, the number of 
machines you could rent would be 
limited. I doubt if you could make 
it a paying proposition.” 

Lanning put his elbows on the 
table and earnestly leaned for- 
ward. “Let me put it bluntly, gen- 
tlemen. Robots cannot be used on 
Earth, except in certain special 
cases, because of prejudice against 
them on the part of the public. 
U. S. Robots is a highly success- 
ful corporation with our extra- 
terrestrial and space-flight markets 
alone, to say nothing of our com- 
puter subsidiaries. However, we 
are concerned with more than 
profits alone. It is our firm belief 
that the use of robots on Earth 
itself would mean a better life for 
all eventually, even if a certain 
amount of economic dislocation re- 
sulted at first. 

“The labor unions are naturally 
against us, but surely we may ex- 
pect cooperation from the large 
universities. The robot, Easy, will 
help you by relieving you of scho- 
lastic drudgery— by assuming, if 
you permit it, the role of galley 
slave for you. Other universities 
and research institutions will fol- 
low your lead, and if it works out, 
then perhaps other robots of other 
types may be placed and the pub- 
lic’s objections to them broken 
down by stages.” 

Minott murmured, “Today 



GALLEY SLAVE 



19 




Northeastern University, tomorrow 
the world.” 

A NGRILY, Lanning whispered 
to Susan Calvin, “I wasn’t 
nearly that eloquent and they 
weren’t nearly that reluctant. At a 
thousand a year, they were jump- 
ing to get Easy. Professor Minott 
told me he’d never seen as beau- 
tiful a job as that graph he was 
holding and there was no mistake 
on the galley or anywhere else. 
Hart admitted it freely.” 

The severe vertical lines on Dr. 
Calvin’s face did not soften. “You 
should have demanded more 
money than they could pay, Al- 
fred, and let them beat you down.” 
“Maybe,” he grumbled. 
Prosecution was not quite done 
with Professor Hart. “After Dr. 
Lanning left, did you vote on 
whether to accept Robot EZ-27?” 
“Yes, we did.” 

“With what result?” 

“In favor of acceptance, by ma- 
jority vote.” 

“What would you say influenced 
the vote?” 

Defense objected immediately. 
Prosecution rephrased the ques- 
tion. “What influenced you, per- 
sonally, in your individual vote? 
You did vote in favor, I think.” 

“I voted in favor, yes. I did so 
largely because I was impressed by 
Dr. Lanning’s feeling that it was 
our duty as members of the world’s 
intellectual leadership to allow ro- 



botics to help Man in the solution 
of his problems.” 

“In other words, Dr. Lanning 
talked you into it.” 

“That’s his job. He did it very 
well.” 

“Your witness.” 

Defense strode up to the witness 
chair and surveyed Professor Hart 
for a long moment. He said, “In 
reality, you were all pretty eager to 
have Robot EZ-2 7 in your employ, 
weren’t you?” 

“We thought that if it could do 
the work, it might be useful.” 

“If it could do the work? I un- 
derstand you examined the 
samples of Robot EZ-27’s original 
work with particular care on the 
day of the meeting which you 
have just described.” 

“Yes, I did. Since the machine’s 
work dealt primarily with the 
handling of the English language, 
and since that is my field of com- 
petence, it seemed logical that I 
be the one chosen to examine the 
work.” 

“Very good. Was there anything 
oh display on the table at the time 
of the meeting which was less than 
satisfactory? I have all the ma- 
terial here as exhibits. Can you 
point to a single unsatisfactory 
item?” 

“Well-” 

“It’s a simple question. Was 
there one single solitary unsatisfac- 
tory item? You inspected it. Was 
there?” 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




The English professor frowned. 
“There wasn’t” 

“I also have some samples of 
work done by Robot EZ-27 dur- 
ing the course of his 14-month em- 
ploy at Northeastern. Would you 
examine these and tell me if there 
is anything wrong with them in 
even one particular?” 

Hart snapped, “When he did 
make a mistake, it was a beauty.” 

“Answer my question,” thun- 
dered Defense, “and only the 
question I am putting to you! Is 
there anything wrong with the 
material?” 

Dean Hart looked cautiously 
at each item. “Well, nothing.” 

“Barring the matter concerning 
which we are here engaged, do you 
know of any mistake on the part 
of EZ-27?” 

“Barring the matter for which 
this trial is being held, no.” 

T'k EFENSE cleared his throat as 
though to signal end of para- 
graph. He said, “Now about the 
vote concerning whether Robot 
EZ-27 was to be employed or 
not. You said there was a majority 
in favor. What was the actual 
vote?” 

“Thirteen to one, as I remem- 
ber.” 

“Thirteen to one! More than 
just a majority, wouldn’t you say?” 

“No, sir!” All the pedant in 
Dean Hart was aroused. “In the 
English language, the word ‘majori- 



ty’ means ‘more than half.’ Thir- 
teen out of fourteen is a majority, 
nothing more.” 

“But an almost unanimous one.” 
“A majority all the same!” 
Defense switched ground. “And 
who was the lone holdout?” 

Dean Hart looked acutely un- 
comfortable. “Professor Simon 
Ninheimer.” 

Defense pretended astonish- 
ment. “Professor Ninheimer? The 
head of the Department of Sociolo- 
gy?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“The plaintiff?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

Defense pursed his lips. “In 
other words, it turns out that the 
man bringing the action for pay- 
ment of $750,000 damages against 
my client, United States Robot 
and Mechanical Men, Incorpor- 
ated, was the one who from the 
beginning opposed the use of the 
robot— although everyone else on 
the Executive Committee of the 
University Senate was persuaded 
that it was a good idea.” 

“He voted against the motion, 
as was his right” 

“You didn’t mention in your de- 
scription of the meeting any re- 
marks made by Professor Ninhei- 
mer. Did he make any?” 

“I think he spoke.” 

“You think?” 

“Well, he did speak.” 

“Against using the robot?” 

“Yes.” 



GALLEY SLAVE 



21 




“Was he violent about it?” 
Dean Hart paused. “He was ve- 
hement.” 

Defense grew confidential. “How 
long have you known Professor 
Ninheimer, Dean Hart?” 

“About twelve years.” 
“Reasonably well?” 

“I should say so, yes.” 
“Knowing him, then, would you 
say he was the kind of man who 
might continue to bear resentment 
against a robot, all the more so be- 
cause an adverse vote had—” 
Prosecution drowned out the 
remainder of the question with an 
indignant and vehement objection 
of his own. Defense motioned the 
witness down and Justice Shane 
called luncheon recess. 

R obertson mangled his 

sandwich. The corporation 
would not founder for loss of three- 
quarters of a million, but the loss 
would do it no particular good. 
He was conscious, moreover, that 
there would be a much more cost- 
ly long-term setback in public 
relations. 

He said sourly, ‘Why all this 
business about how Easy got into 
the university? What do they hope 
to gain?” 

The Attorney for Defense said 
quietly, “A court action is like a 
chess game, Mr. Robertson. The 
winner is usually the one who can 
see more moves ahead, and my 
friend at the prosecutor’s table is 



no beginner. They can show dam- 
age; that’s no problem. Their main 
effort lies in anticipating our de- 
fense. They must be counting on 
us to try to show that Easy 
couldn’t possibly have committed 
the offense — because of the Laws 
of Robotics.” 

“All right,” said Robertson, “that 
is our defense. An absolutely air- 
tight one.” 

“To a robotics engineer. Not 
necessarily to a judge. They’re set- 
ting themselves up a position from 
which they can demonstrate that 
EZ-27 was no ordinary robot. It 
was the first of its type to be of- 
fered to the public. It was an ex- 
perimental model that needed 
field-testing and the university was 
the only decent way to provide 
such testing. That would look 
plausible in the light of Dr. Lan- 
ning’s strong efforts to place the 
robot and the willingness of U. S. 
Robots to lease it for so little. The 
prosecution would then argue that 
the field-test proved Easy to have 
been a failure. Now do you see 
the purpose of what’s been going 
on?” 

“But EZ-27 was a perfectly 
good model,” argued Robertson. 

“It was the 27th in production.” 

“Which is really a bad point,” 
said Defense somberly. “What was 
wrong with the first 26? Obvious- 
ly something. Why shouldn’t there 
be something wrong with the 27th, 
too?” 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“There was nothing wrong with 
the first 26 except that they 
weren’t complex enough for the 
task. These were the first posi- 
tronic brains of the sort to be con- 
structed and it was rather hit-and- 
miss to begin with. But the Three 
Laws held in all of them! No robot 
is so imperfect that the Three 
Laws don’t hold.” 

“Dr. Lanning has explained this 
to me, Mr. Robertson, and I am 
willing to take his word for it. The 
judge, however, may not be. We 
are expecting a decision from an 
honest and intelligent man who 
knows no robotics and thus may be 
led astray. For instance, if you or 
Dr. Lanning or Dr. Calvin were 
to say on the stand that any posi- 
tronic brains were constructed ‘hit- 
and-miss,’ as you just did, Prosecu- 
tion would tear you apart in cross- 
examination. Nothing would sal- 
vage our case. So that’s something 
to avoid.” 

Robertson growled, “If only 
Easy would talk.” 

Defense shrugged. “A robot is 
incompetent as a witness, so that 
would do us no good.” 

“At least we’d know some of the 
facts. We’d know how it came to 
do such a thing.” 

^USAN Calvin fired up. A dull- 
^ ish red touched her cheeks 
and her voice had a trace of 
warmth in it “We know how Easy 
came to do it It was ordered to! 



I’ve explained this to counsel and 
I’ll explain it to you now.” 

“Ordered to by whom?” asked 
Robertson in honest astonishment 
(No one ever told him anything, 
he thought resentfully. These re- 
search people considered them- 
selves the owners of U. S. Robots, 
by God!) 

“By the plaintiff,” said Dr. Cal- 
vin. 

“In heaven’s name, why?” 

“I don’t know why yet Perhaps 
just that we might be sued, that he 
might gain some cash.” There were 
blue glints in her eyes as she said 
that. 

“Then why doesn’t Easy say 
so?” 

“Isn’t that obvious? It’s been or- 
dered to keep quiet about the mat- 
ter.” 

“Why should that be obvious?” 
demanded Robertson truculently. 

“Well, it’s obvious to me. Robot 
psychology is my profession. If 
Easy will not answer questions 
about the matter directly, he will 
answer questions on the fringe of 
the matter. By measuring in- 
creased hesitation in his answers as 
the central question is approached, 
by measuring the area of blank- 
ness and the intensity of counter- 
potentials set up, it is possible to 
tell with scientific precision that his 
troubles are the result of an order 
not to talk, with its strength based 
on First Law. In other words, he’s 
been told that if he talks, harm will 



GALLEY SLAVE 



23 




be done a human being. Presum- 
ably harm to the unspeakable Pro- 
fessor Ninheimer, the plaintiff, 
who, to the robot, would seem a 
human being.” 

“Well, then,” said Robertson, 
“can’t you explain that if he keeps 
quiet, harm will be done to U. S. 
Robots?” 

“U. S. Robots is not a human 
being and the First Law of Ro- 
botics does not recognize a cor- 
poration as a person the way ordi- 
nary laws do. Besides, it would be 
dangerous to try to lift this par- 
ticular sort of inhibition. The per- 
son who laid it on could lift it off 
least dangerously, because the ro- 
bot’s motivations in that respect 
are centered on that person. Any 
other course—” She shook her head 
and grew almost impassioned. “I 
won’t let the robot be damaged!” 

T ANNING interrupted with the 
•*“* air of bringing sanity to the 
problem. “It seems to me that we 
have only to prove a robot incap- 
able of the act of which Easy is 
accused. We can do that.” 

“Exactly,” said Defense, in an- 
noyance. “ You can do that. The 
only witnesses capable of testify- 
ing to Easy’s condition and to the 
nature of Easy’s state of mind are 
employees of U. S. Robots. The 
judge can’t possibly accept their 
testimony as unprejudiced.” 

“How can he deny expert testi- 
mony?” 



“By refusing to be convinced by 
it. That’s his right as the judge. 
Against the alternative that a man 
like Professor Ninheimer deliber- 
ately set about ruining his own 
reputation, even for a sizable sum 
of money, the judge isn’t going to 
accept the technicalities of your 
engineers. The judge is a man, af- 
ter all. If he has to choose between 
a man doing an impossible thing 
and a robot doing an impossible 
thing, he’s quite likely to decide 
in favor of the man.” 

“A man can do an impossible 
thing,” said Lanning, “because we 
don’t know all the complexities of 
the human mind and we don’t 
know what, in a given human mind, 
is impossible and what is not. We 
do know what is really impossible 
to a robot” 

“Well, we’ll see if we can’t con- 
vince the judge of that,” Defense 
replied wearily. 

“If all you say is so,” rumbled 
Robertson, “I don’t see how you 
can.” 

“We’ll see. It’s good to know and 
be aware of the difficulties in- 
volved, but let’s not be too down- 
hearted. I’ve tried to look ahead a 
few moves in the chess-game, too.” 
With a stately nod in the direction 
of the robopsychologist, he added, 
“With the help of the good lady 
here.” 

Lanning looked from one to the 
other and said, “What the devil is 
this?”

But the bailiff thrust his head 
into the room and announced 
somewhat breathlessly that the 
trial was about to resume. 

They took their seats, examin- 
ing the man who had started all 
the trouble. 

Simon Ninheimer owned a 
fluffy head of sandy hair, a face 
that narrowed past a beaked nose 
toward a pointed chin, and a habit 
of sometimes hesitating before key 
words in his conversation that gave 
him an air of a seeker after an al- 
most unbearable precision. When 
he said, “The Sun rises in the— 
uh— east,” one was certain he had 
given due consideration to the pos- 
sibility that it might at some time 
rise in the west 

Prosecution said, “Did you op- 
pose employment of Robot EZ-27 
by the university?” 

“I did, sir.” 

“Why was that?” 

“I did not feel that we under- 
stood the— uh— motives of U. S. 
Robots thoroughly. I mistrusted 
their anxiety to place the robot 
with us.” 

“Did you feel that it was capable 
of doing the work that it was al- 
legedly designed to do?” 

“I know for a fact that it was 
not” 

“Would you state your reasons?” 

S IMON Ninheimer’s book, en- 
titled Social Tensions Involved 
in Space-Flight and Their Resolu- 



tion , had been eight years in the 
making. Ninheimer’s search for 
precision was not confined to his 
habits of speech, and in a subject 
like sociology, almost inherently 
imprecise, it left him breathless. 

Even with the material in gal- 
ley proofs, he felt no sense of com- 
pletion. Rather the reverse, in fact 
Staring at the long strips of print, 
he felt only the itch to tear the 
lines of type apart and rearrange 
them differently. 

Jim Baker, Instructor and soon 
to • be Assistant Professor of So- 
ciology, found Ninheimer, three 
days after the first batch of galleys 
had arrived from the printer, star- 
ing at the handful of paper in ab- 
straction. The galleys came in 
three copies: one for Ninheimer 
to proofread, one for Baker to 
proofread independently, and a 
third, marked “Original,” which 
was to receive the final corrections, 
a combination of those made by 
Ninheimer and by Baker, after a 
conference at which possible con- 
flicts and disagreements were 
ironed out. This had been their 
policy on the several papers on 
which they had collaborated in the 
past three years and it worked 
well. 

Baker, young and ingratiating- 
ly soft-voiced, had his own copies 
of the galleys in his hand. He said 
eagerly, “I’ve done the first chap- 
ter and they contain some typo- 
graphical beauts.”

“The first chapter always has 
them,” said Ninheimer distantly. 

“Do you want to go over it 
now?” 

Ninheimer brought his eyes to 
grave focus on Baker. “I haven’t 
done anything on the galleys, Jim. 
I don’t think I’ll bother.” 

Baker looked confused. “Not 
bother?” 

Ninheimer pursed his lips “I’ve 
asked about the— uh— workload of 
the machine. After all, he was 
originally — uh — promoted as a 
proofreader. They’ve set a sched- 
ule.” 

“The machine? You mean 
Easy?” 

“I believe that is the foolish 
name they gave it.” 

“But, Dr. Ninheimer, I thought 
you were staying clear of it!” 

“I seem .to be the only one do- 
ing so. Perhaps I ought to take my 
share of the— uh— advantage.” 

“Oh. Well, I seem to have 
wasted time on this first chapter, 
then,” said the younger man rue- 
fully. 

“Not wasted. We can compare 
the machine’s result with yours as 
a check.” 

“If you want to, but—” 

“Yes?” 

“I doubt that we’ll find any- 
thing wrong with Easy’s work. It’s 
supposed never to have made a 
mistake.” 

“I dare say,” said Ninheimer 
dryly. 



r I ’HE first chapter was brought in 
again by Baker four days later. 
This time it was Ninheimer’s copy, 
fresh from the special annex that 
had been built to house Easy and 
the equipment it used. 

Baker was jubilant. “Dr. Nin- 
heimer, it not only caught every- 
thing I caught— it found a dozen 
errors I missed! The whole thing 
took it twelve minutes!” 

Ninheimer looked over the 
sheaf, with the neatly printed 
marks and symbols in the mar- 
gins. He said, “It is not as com- 
plete as you and I would have 
made it. We would have entered 
an insert on Suzuki’s work on the 
neurological effects of low gravity.” 
“You mean his. paper in Socio- 
logical Reviews?” 

“Of course.” 

“Well, you can’t expect impos- 
sibilities of Easy. It can’t read the 
literature for us.” 

“I realize that. As a matter of 
fact, I have prepared the insert. 
I will see the machine and make 
certain it knows how to— uh— 
handle inserts.” 

“It will know.” 

“I prefer to make certain.” 
Ninheimer had to make an ap- 
pointment to see Easy, and then 
could get nothing better than fif- 
teen minutes in the late evening. 

But the fifteen minutes turned 
out to be ample. Robot EZ-27 un- 
derstood the matter of inserts at 
once.

Ninheimer found himself un- 
comfortable at close quarters with 
the robot for the first time. Al- 
most automatically, as though it 
were human, he found himself ask- 
ing, “Are you happy with your 
work?” 

“Most happy, Professor Ninhei- 
mer,” said Easy solemnly, the pho- 
to-cells that were its eyes gleam- 
ing their normal deep red. 

“You know me?” 

“From the fact that you present 
me with additional material to in- 
clude in the galleys, it follows that 
you are the author. The author’s 
name, of course, is at the head of 
each sheet of galley proof.” 

“I see. You make— uh— deduc- 
tions, then. Tell me—” he couldn’t 
resist the question— “what do you 
think of the book so far?” 

Easy said, “I find it very pleas- 
ant to work with.” 

“Pleasant? That is an odd word 
for a— uh— a mechanism without 
emotion. I’ve been told you have 
no emotion.” 

“The words of your book go in 
accordance with my circuits,” Easy 
explained. “They set up little or no 
counter-potentials. It is in my 
brain-paths to translate this me- 
chanical fact into a word such as 
‘pleasant.’ The emotional context 
is fortuitous.” 

“I see. Why do you find the 
book pleasant?” 

“It deals with human beings, 
Professor, and not with inorganic 



materials or mathematical sym- 
bols. Your book attempts to under- 
stand human beings and to help 
increase human happiness.” 

“And this is what you try to do 
and so my book goes in accord- 
ance with your circuits? Is that 
it?” 

“That is it, Professor.” 

The fifteen minutes were up. 
Ninheimer left and went to the 
university library, which was on 
the point of closing. He kept them 
open long enough to find an ele- 
mentary text on robotics. He took 
it home with him. 

Tj 1 XCEPT for occasional inser- 
tion of late material, the gal- 
leys went to Easy and from him 
to the publishers with little inter- 
vention from Ninheimer at first— 
and none at all later. 

Baker said, a little uneasily, “It 
almost gives me a feeling of use- 
lessness.” 

“It should give you a feeling of 
having time to begin a new proj- 
ect,” said Ninheimer, without look- 
ing up from the notations he was 
making in the current issue of So- 
cial Science Abstracts. 

“I’m just not used to it. I keep 
worrying about the galleys. It’s 
silly, I know.” 

“It is.” 

“The other day I got a couple 
of sheets before Easy sent them 
off to—” 

“What!” Ninheimer looked up, 



GALLEY SLAVE

scowling. The copy of Abstracts 
slid shut. “Did you disturb the 
machine at its work? 5 ’ 

“Only for a minute. Everything 
was all right. Oh, it changed one 
word. You referred to something 
as ‘criminal’; it changed the word 
to ‘reckless.’ It thought the second 
adjective fit in better with the 
context.” 

Ninheimer grew thoughtful. 
“What did you think?” 

“You know, I agreed with it. I 
let it stand.” 

Ninheimer turned in his swivel- 
chair to face his young associate. 
“See here, I wish you wouldn’t 
do this again. If I am to use the 
machine, I wish the— uh— full ad- 
vantage of it. If I am to use it 
and lose your — uh — services 
anyway because you supervise it 
when the whole point is that it re- 
quires no supervision, I gain 
nothing. Do you see?” 

“Yes, Dr. Ninheimer,” said 
Baker, subdued. 

The advance copies of Social 
Tensions arrived in Dr. Ninhei- 
mer’s office on the 8th of May. 
He looked through it briefly, flip- 
ping pages and pausing to read a 
paragraph here and there. Then 
he put his copies away. 

As he explained later, he for- 
got about it. For eight years, he 
had worked at it, but now, and for 
months in the past, other interests 
had engaged him while Easy had 
taken the load of the book off his 



shoulders. He did not even think 
to donate the usual complimentary 
copy to the university library. 
Even Baker, who had thrown him- 
self into work and had steered 
clear of the d&partment head since 
receiving his rebuke at their last 
meeting, received no copy. 

On the 16 th of June that 
stage ended. Ninheimer received a 
phone call and stared at the image 
in the ’plate with surprise. 
“Speidell! Are you in town?” 
“No, sir. I’m in Cleveland.” Spei- 
dell’s voice trembled with emotion. 
“Then why the call?” 

“Because I’ve just been looking 
through your new book! Ninhei- 
mer, are you mad? Have you gone 
insane?” 

TV INHEIMER stiffened. “Is 
-L ' something — uh — wrong?” he 
asked in alarm. 

“Wrong? I refer you to page 
562. What in blazes do you mean 
by interpreting my work as you 
do? Where in the paper cited do 
I make the claim that the criminal 
personality is non-existent and 
that it is the /aw-enforcement agen- 
cies that are the true criminals? 
Here, let me quote—” 

“Wait! Wait!” cried Ninheimer, 
trying to find the page. “Let me 
see. Let me see . Good God!” 
“Well?” 

“Speidell, I don’t see how this 
could have happened. I never 
wrote this.” 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“But that’s what’s printed! And 
that distortion isn’t the worst. You 
look at page 690 and imagine 
what Ipatiev is going to do to you 
when he sees the hash you’ve 
made of his findings! Look, Nin- 
heimer, the book is riddled with 
this sort of thing. I don’t know 
what you were thinking of— but 
there’s nothing to do but get the 
book off the market. And you’d 
better be prepared for extensive 
apologies at the next Association 
meeting!” 

“Speidell, listen to me—” 

But Speidell had flashed off with 
a force that had the ’plate glowing 
with after-images for fifteen sec- 
onds. 

It was then that Ninheimer went 
through the book and began mark- 
ing off passages with red ink. 

He kept his temper remarkably 
well when he faced Easy again, 
but his lips were pale. He passed 
the book to Easy and said, “Will 
you read the marked passages on 
pages 562, 631, 664 and 690?” 
Easy did so in four glances. 
“Yes, Professor Ninheimer.” 

“This is not as I had it in the 
original galleys.” 

“No, sir. It is not.” 

“Did you change it to read as 
it now does?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Why?” 

“Sir, the passages as they read 
in your version were most un- 
complimentary to certain groups 



of human beings. I felt it advis- 
able to change the wording to 
avoid doing them harm.” 

“How dared you do such a 
thing?” 

“The First Law, Professor, does 
not let me, through any inaction, 
allow harm to come to human be- 
ings. Certainly, considering your 
reputation in the world of sociolo- 
gy and the wide circulation your 
book would receive among 
scholars, considerable harm would 
come to a number of the human 
beings you speak of.” 

“But do you realize the harm 
that will come to me now?” 

“It was necessary to choose the 
alternative with less harm.” 
Professor Ninheimer, shaking 
with fury, staggered away. It was 
clear to him that U. S. Robots 
would have to account to him for 
this. 

HP HERE was some excitement 
at the defendants’ table, which 
increased as Prosecution drove the 
point home. 

“Then Robot EZ-27 informed 
you that the reason for its action 
was based on the First Law of 
Robotics?” 

“That is correct, sir.” 

“That, in effect, it had no 
choice?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“It follows then that U. S. Ro- 
bots designed a robot that would 
of necessity rewrite books to ac- 



GALLEY SLAVE

cord with its own conceptions of 
what was right. And yet they 
palmed it off as simple proofread- 
er. Would you say that?” 

Defense objected firmly at once, 
pointing out that the witness was 
being asked for a decision on a 
matter in which he had no com- 
petence. The judge admonished 
Prosecution in the usual terms, 
but there was no doubt that the 
exchange had sunk home— not least 
upon the attorney for the Defense. 

Defense asked for a short re- 
cess before beginning cross-exami- 
nation, using a legal technicality 
for the purpose that got him five 
minutes. 

He leaned over toward Susan 
Calvin. “Is it possible, Dr. Calvin, 
that Professor Ninheimer is telling 
the truth and that Easy was mo- 
tivated by the First Law?” 

Calvin pressed her lips together, 
then said, “No. It isn’t possible. 
The last part of Ninheimer’s testi- 
mony is deliberate perjury. Easy 
is not designed to be able to judge 
matters at the stage of abstraction 
represented by an advanced text- 
book on sociology. It would never 
be able to tell that certain groups 
of humans would be harmed by a 
phrase in such a book. Its mind 
is simply not built for that.” 

“I suppose, though, that we 
can’t prove this to a layman,” said 
Defense pessimistically. 

“No,” admitted Calvin. “The 
proof would be highly complex. 



Our way out is still what it was. 
We must prove Ninheimer is ly- 
ing, and nothing he has said need 
change our plan of attack.” 

“Very well, Dr. Calvin,” said 
Defense, “I must accept your word 
in this. We’ll go on as planned.” 
In the courtroom, the judge’s 
gavel rose and fell and Dr. Nin- 
heimer took the stand once more. 
He smiled a little as one who feels 
his position to be impregnable 
and rather enjoys the prospect of 
countering a useless attack. 

Defense approached warily and 
began softly. “Dr. Ninheimer, do 
you mean to say that you were 
completely unaware of these al- 
leged changes in your manuscript 
until such time as Dr. Speidell 
called you on the 16th of June?” 
“That is correct, sir.” 

“Did you never look at the gal- 
leys after Robot EZ-27 had proof- 
read them?” 

“At first I did, but it seemed to 
me a useless task. I relied on the 
claims of U. S. Robots. The ab- 
surd— uh— changes were made only 
in the last quarter of the book af- 
ter the robot, I presume, had 
learned enough about sociology—” 
“Never mind your presump- 
tions!” said Defense. “I understood 
your colleague, Dr. Baker, saw 
the later galleys on at least one 
occasion. Do you remember testi- 
fying to that effect?” 

“Yes, sir. As I said, he told me 
about seeing one page, and even 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




there, the robot had changed a 
word.” 

A GAIN Defense broke in. 

“Don’t you find it strange, 

sir, that after over a year of im- 
placable hostility to the robot, after 
having voted against it in the first 
place and having refused to put 
it to any use whatever, you sud- 
denly decided to put your book, 
your magnum opus, into its 
hands?” 

“I don’t find that strange. I 

simply decided that I might as 
well use the machine.” 

“And you were so confident of 
Robot EZ-27— all of a sudden— 
that you didn’t even bother to 

check your galleys?” 

“I told you I was — uh — per- 
suaded by U. S. Robots’ propagan- 
da.” 

“So persuaded that when your 
colleague, Dr. Baker, attempted to 
check on the robot, you berated 
him soundly?” 

“I didn’t berate him. I merely 
did not wish to have him— uh— 
waste his time. At least, I thought 
then it was a waste of time. I did 
not see the significance of that 
change in a word at the—” 

Defense said with heavy sar- 
casm, “I have no doubt you were 
instructed to bring up that point 
in order that the word-change be 
entered in the record—” He al- 
tered his line to forestall objection 
and said, “The point is that you 



were extremely angry with Dr. 
Baker.” 

“No, sir. Not angry.” 

“You didn’t give him a copy of 
your book when you received it.” 
“Simple forgetfulness. I didn’t 
give the library its copy, either.” 
Ninheimer smiled cautiously. “Pro- 
fessors are notoriously absent- 
minded.” 

Defense said, “Do you find it 
strange that, after more than a 
year of perfect work, Robot EZ-27 
should go wrong on your book? On 
a book, that is, which was written 
by you, who was, of all people, 
the most implacably hostile to the 
robot?” 

“My book was the only sizable 
work dealing with mankind that 
it had to face. The Three Laws 
of Robotics took hold then.” 
“Several times, Dr. Ninheimer,” 
said Defense, “you have tried to 
sound like an expert on robotics. 
Apparently you suddenly grew in- 
terested in robotics and took out 
books on the subject from the 
library. You testified to that ef- 
fect, did you not?” 

“One book, sir. That was the 
result of what seems to me to have 
been— uh— natural curiosity.” 

“And it enabled you to explain 
why the robot should, as you al- 
lege, have distorted your book?” 
“Yes, sir.” 

“Very convenient. But are you 
sure your interest in robotics was 
not intended to enable you to

31 




manipulate the robot for your own 
purposes?” 

Ninheimer flushed. “Certainly 
not, sir!” 

Defense’s voice rose. “In fact, 
are you sure the alleged altered 
passages were not as you had them 
in the first place?” 

The sociologist half-rose. “That’s 
— uh — uh — ridiculous! I have the 
galleys—” 

He had difficulty speaking and 
Prosecution rose to insert smooth- 
ly, “With your permission, Your 
Honor, I intend to introduce as 
evidence the set of galleys given 
by Dr. Ninheimer to Robot EZ-27 
and the set of galleys mailed by 
Robot EZ-27 to the publishers. I 
will do so now if my esteemed col- 
league so desires, and will be will- 
ing to allow a recess in order that 
the two sets of galleys may be 
compared.” 

rkEFENSE waved his hand im- 
patiently. “That is not neces- 
sary. My honored opponent can 
introduce those galleys whenever 
he chooses. I’m sure they will show 
whatever discrepancies are claimed 
by the plaintiff to exist. What I 
would like to know of the witness, 
however, is whether he also has 
in his possession Dr. Baker’s gal- 
leys.” 

“Dr. Baker’s galleys?” Ninhei- 
mer frowned. He was not yet 
quite master of himself. 

“Yes, Professor! I mean Dr. 




Baker’s galleys. You testified to 
the effect that Dr. Baker had re- 
ceived a separate copy of the gal- 
leys. I will have the clerk read 
your testimony if you are sud- 
denly a selective type of amnesiac. 
Or is it just that professors are, 
as you say, notoriously absent- 
minded?”

••Ninheimer said, “1 remember 
Dr. Baker’s galleys. They weren’t 
necessary once the job was placed 
in the care of the proofreading 
machine—” 

“So you burned them?” 

“No. I put them in the waste 
basket” 

“Burned them, dumped them— 



what’s the difference? The point 
is you got rid of them.” 

“There’s nothing wrong—” be- 
gan Ninheimer weakly. 

“Nothing wrong?” thundered 
Defense. “Nothing wrong except 
that there is now no way we can 
check to see if, on certain crucial 
galley sheets, you might not have

substituted a harmless blank one 
from Dr. Baker’s copy for a sheet 
in your own copy which you had 
deliberately mangled in such a 
way as to force the robot to—” 

Prosecution shouted a furious 
objection. Justice Shane leaned 
forward, his round face doing its 
best to assume an expression of 
anger equivalent to the intensity 
of the emotion felt by the man. 

The judge said, “Do you have 
any evidence, Counselor, for the 
extraordinary statement you have 
just made?” 

Defense said quietly, “No direct 
evidence, Your Honor. But I would 
like to point out that, viewed prop- 
erly, the sudden conversion of the 
plaintiff from anti-roboticism, his 
-sudden interest in robotics, his 
refusal to check the galleys or to 
allow anyone else to check them, 
his careful neglect to allow any- 
one to see the book immediately 
after publication, all very clearly 
point—” 

“Counselor,” interrupted the 
judge impatiently, “this is not the 
place for esoteric deductions. The 
plaintiff is not on trial. Neither are 
you prosecuting him. I forbid this 
line of attack and I can only point 
out that the desperation that must 
have induced you to do this can- 
not help but weaken your case. 
If you have legitimate questions to 
ask, Counselor, you may continue 
with your cross-examination. But 
I warn you against another such 



exhibition in this courtroom.” 

“I have no further questions, 
Your Honor.” 

Robertson whispered ' heatedly 
as counsel for the Defense returned 
to his table, “What good did that 
do, for God’s sake? The judge is 
dead-set against you now.” 

Defense replied calmly, “But 
Ninheimer is good and rattled. And 
we’ve set him up for tomorrow’s 
move. He’ll be ripe.” 

Susan Calvin nodded gravely. 

r T'HE rest of Prosecution’s case 
was mild in comparison. Dr. 
Baker was called and bore out 
most of Ninheimer’s testimony. 
Drs. Speidell and Ipatiev were 
called, and they expounded most 
movingly on their shock and dis- 
may at certain quoted passages in 
Dr. Ninheimer’s book. Both gave 
their professional opinion that Dr. 
Ninheimer’s professional reputa- 
tion had been seriously impaired. 

The galleys were introduced in 
evidence, as were copies of the 
finished book. 

Defense cross-examined no more 
that day. Prosecution rested and 
the trial was recessed till the next 
morning. 

Defense made his first motion 
at the beginning of the proceed- 
ings on the second day. He re- 
quested that Robot EZ-27 be 
admitted as a spectator to the pro- 
ceedings. 

Prosecution objected at once 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and Justice Shane called both to 
the bench. 

Prosecution said hotly, “This is 
obviously illegal. A robot may not 
be in any edifice used by the gen- 
eral public.” 

“This courtroom,” pointed out 
Defense, “is closed to all but those 
having an immediate connection 
with the case.” 

“A large machine of known er- 
ratic behavior would disturb my 
clients and my witnesses by its 
very presence! It would make 
hash out of the proceedings.” 

The judge seemed inclined to 
agree. He turned to Defense and 
said rather unsympathetically, 
“What are the reasons for your 
request?” 

Defense said, “It will be our con- 
tention that Robot EZ-27 could 
not possibly, by the nature of its 
construction, have behaved as it 
has been described as behaving. 
It will be necessary to present a 
few demonstrations.” 

Prosecution said, “I don’t see 
the point, Your Honor. Demon- 
strations conducted by men em- 
ployed at U. S. Robots are worth 
little as evidence when U. S. Ro- 
bots is the defendant.” 

“Your Honor,” said Defense, 
“the validity of any evidence is 
for you to decide, not for the 
Prosecuting Attorney. At least, 
that is my understanding.” 

Justice Shane, his prerogatives 
encroached upon, said, “Your un- 



derstanding is correct. Neverthe- 
less, the presence of a robot here 
does raise important legal ques- 
tions.” 

“Surely, Your Honor, nothing 
that should be allowed to over- 
ride the requirements of justice. 
If the robot is not present, we are 
prevented from presenting our 
only defense.” 

The judge considered. “There 
would be the question of transport- 
ing the robot here.” 

“That is a problem with which 
U. S. Robots has frequently been 
faced. We have a truck parked 
outside the courtroom, constructed 
according to the laws governing 
the transportation of robots. Ro- 
bot EZ-27 is in a packing case in- 
side with two men guarding it. The 
doors to the truck are properly 
secured and all other necessary 
precautions have been taken.” 
“You seem certain,” said Just- 
tice Shane, in renewed ill-temper, 
“that judgment on this point will 
be in your favor.” 

“Not at all, Your Honor. If it 
is not, we simply turn the truck 
about. I have made no presump- 
tions concerning youj: decision.” 
The judge nodded. “The request 
on the part of the Defense is 
granted.” 

The crate was carried in on a 
large dolly and the two men who 
handled it opened it. The court- 
room was immersed in a dead si- 
lence.

S USAN Calvin waited as the 
thick slabs of celluform went 
down, then held out one hand. 
“Come, Easy.” 

The robot looked in her direc- 
tion and held out its large metal 
arm. It towered over her by two 
feet but followed meekly, like a 
child in the clasp of its mother. 
Someone giggled nervously and 
choked it off at a hard glare from 
Dr. Calvin. 

Easy seated itself carefully in 
a large chair brought by the bailiff, 
which creaked but held. 

Defense said, “When it becomes 
necessary, Your Honor, we will 
prove that this is actually Robot 
EZ-27, the specific robot in the 
employ of Northeastern University 
during the period of time with 
which we are concerned.” 

“Good,” His Honor said. “That 
will be necessary. I, for one, have 
no idea how you can tell one robot 
from another.” 

“And now,” said Defense, “I 
would like to call my first witness 
to the stand. Professor Simon Nm- 
heimer, please.” 

The clerk hesitated, looked at 
the judge. Justice Shane asked, 
with visible surprise, “You are 
calling the plaintiff as your wit- 
ness?” 

“Yes, Your Honor.” 

“I hope that you’re aware that 
as long as he’s your witness, you 
will be allowed none of the lati- 
tude you might exercise if you 



were cross-examining an opposing 
witness.” 

Defense said smoothly, “My 
only purpose in all this is to ar- 
rive at the truth. It will not be 
necessary to do more than ask a 
few polite questions.” 

“Well,” said the judge dubious- 
ly, “you’re the one handling the 
case. Call the witness.” 

Ninheimer took the stand and 
was informed that he was still un- 
der oath. He looked more nervous 
than he had the day before, al- 
most apprehensive. 

But Defense looked at him be- 
nignly. 

“Now, Professor Ninheimer, you 
are suing my clients in the amount 
of $750,000.” 

“That is the— uh— sum. Yes.” 

“That is a great deal of money.” 

“I have suffered a great deal 
of harm.” 

“Surely not that much. The ma- 
terial in question involves only a 
few passages in a book. Perhaps 
these were unfortunate passages, 
but after all, books sometimes ap- 
pear with curious mistakes in 
them” 

Ninheimer’s nostrils flared. “Sir, 
this book was to have been the 
climax of my professional career! 
Instead, it makes me look like an 
incompetent scholar, a perverter 
of the views held by my honored 
friends and associates, and a be- 
liever of ridiculous and— uh— out- 
moded viewpoints. My reputation 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




is irretrievably shattered! I can 
never hold up my head in any— 
uh— assemblage of scholars, regard- 
less of the outcome of this trial. 
I certainly cannot continue in my 
career, which has been the whole 
of my life. The very purpose of 
my life has been— uh— aborted and 
destroyed.” 

Defense made no attempt to in- 
terrupt the speech, but stared ab- 
stractedly at hi§ fingernails as it 
went on. 

He said very soothingly, “But 
surely, Professor Ninheimer, at 
your present age, you could not 
hope to earn more than— let us 
be generous— $150,000 during the 
remainder of your life. Yet you 
are asking the court to award you 
five times as much.” 

TyiNHEIMER said, with an 
-L ^ even greater burst of emotion, 
“It is not in my lifetime alone that 
I am ruined. I do not know for 
how many generations I shall be 
pointed at by sociologists as a— 
uh — a fool or maniac. My real 
achievements will be buried and 
ignored. I am ruined not only until 
the day of my death, but for all 
time to come, because there will 
always be people who will not 
believe that a robot made those 
insertions—” 

It was at this point that Robot 
EZ-27 rose to his feet. Susan Cal- 
vin made no move to stop him. 
She sat motionless, staring straight 



ahead. Defense sighed softly. 

Easy’s melodious voice carried 
clearly. It said, “I would like to 
explain to everyone that I did in- 
sert certain passages in the gal- 
ley proofs that seemed directly op- 
posed to what had been there at 
first—” 

Even the Prosecuting Attorney 
was too startled at the spectacle 
of a seven-foot robot rising to ad- 
dress the court to be able to de- 
mand the stopping of what was 
obviously a most irregular proced- 
ure. 

When he could collect his wits, 
it was too late. For Ninheimer rose 
in the witness chair, his face work- 
ing. 

He shouted wildly, “Damn you, 
you were instructed to keep your 
mouth shut about—” 

He ground to a choking halt, 
and Easy was silent, too. 

Prosecution was on his feet now, 
demanding that a mistrial be de- 
clared. 

Justice Shane banged his gavel 
desperately. “Silence! Silence! Cer- 
tainly there is every reason here to 
declare a mistrial, except that in 
the interests of justice I would like 
to have Professor Ninheimer com- 
plete his statement. I distinctly 
heard him say to the robot that 
the robot had been instructed to 
keep its mouth shut about some- 
thing. There was no mention in 
your testimony, Professor Ninhei- 
mer, as to any instructions to the 



GALLEY SLAVE 



37 




robot to keep silent about any- 
thing!” 

Ninheimer stared wordlessly at 
the judge. 

Justice Shane said, “Did you 
instruct Robot EZ-27 to keep si- 
lent about something? And if so, 
about what?” 

“Your Honor—” began Ninhei- 
mer hoarsely, and couldn’t con- 
tinue. 

The judge’s voice grew sharp. 
“Did you, in fact, order the in- 
serts in question to be made in the 
galleys and then order the robot to 
keep quiet about your part in 
this?” 

Prosecution objected vigorous- 
ly, but Ninheimer shouted, “Oh, 
what’s the use? Yes! Yes!” And 
he ran from the witness stand. He 
was stopped at the door by the 
bailiff and sank hopelessly into 
one of the last rows of seats, head 
buried in both hands. 

Justice Shane said, “It is evident 
to me that Robot EZ-27 was 
brought here as a trick. Except for 
the fact that the trick served to 
prevent a serious miscarriage of 
justice, I would certainly hold at- 
torney for the Defense in con- 
tempt. It is clear now, beyond any 
doubt, that the plaintiff has com- 
mitted what is to me a complete- 
ly inexplicable fraud since, ap- 
parently, he was knowingly ruining 
his career in the process—” 

Judgment, of course, was for the 
defendant.

1~\R. Susan Calvin had herself 
announced at Dr. Ninheimer’s 
bachelor quarters in University 
Hall. The young engineer who had 
driven the car offered to go up 
with her, but she looked at him 
scornfully. 

“Do you think he’ll assault me? 
Wait down here.” 

Ninheimer was in no mood to 
assault anyone. He was packing, 
wasting no time, anxious to be 
away before the adverse conclu- 
sion of the trial became general 
knowledge. 

He looked at Calvin with a 
queerly defiant air and said, “Are 
you coming to warn me of a coun- 
ter-suit? If so, it will get you 
nothing. I have no money, no job, 
no future. I can’t even meet the 
costs of the trial.” 

“If you’re looking for sympathy,” 
said Calvin coldly, “don’t look for 
it here. This was your doing. How- 
ever, there will be no counter-suit, 
neither of you nor of the univer- 
sity. We will even do what we can 
to keep you from going to prison 
for perjury. We aren’t vindictive.” 
“Oh, is that why I’m not already 
in custody for forswearing myself? 
I had wondered. But then,” he 
added bitterly, “why should you 
be vindictive? You have what you 
want now.” 

“Some of what we want, yes,” 
said Calvin. “The university will 
keep Easy in its employ at a con- 
siderably higher rental fee. Fur- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




thermore, certain underground 
publicity concerning the trial will 
make it possible to place a few 
more of the EZ models in other 
institutions without danger of a 
repetition of this trouble” 

“Then why have you come to 
see me?” 

“Because I don’t have all of 
what I want yet. I want to know 
why you hate robots as you do. 
Even if you had won the case, your 
reputation would have been ruined. 
The money you might have ob- 
tained could not have compen- 
sated for that. Would the satis- 
faction of your hatred for robots 
have done so?” 

“Are you interested in human 
minds, Dr. Calvin?” asked Nin- 
heimer, with acid mockery. 

“Insofar as their reactions con- 
cern the welfare of robots, yes. 
For that reason, I have learned a 
little of human psychology.” 

“Enough of it to be able to 
trick me!” 

“That wasn’t hard,” said Calvin, 
without pomposity. “The difficult 
thing was doing it in such a way 
as not to damage Easy.” 

“It is like you to be more con- 
cerned for a machine than for a 
man.” He looked at her with 
savage contempt. 

It left her unmoved. “It mere- 
ly seems so, Professor Ninheimer. 
It is only by being concerned for 
robots that one can truly be con- 
cerned for twenty-first-century 



Man. You would understand this 
if you were a roboticist.” 

“I have read enough robotics to 
know I don’t want to be a roboti- 
cist!” 

“Pardon me, you have read a 
book on robotics. It has taught you 
nothing. You learned enough to 
know that you could order a robot 
to do many things, even to falsify 
a book, if you went about it proper- 
ly. You learned enough to know 
that you could not order him to 
forget something entirely without 
risking detection, but you thought 
you could order him into simple 
silence more safely. You were 
wrong.” 

“You guessed the truth from 
his silence?” 

“It wasn’t guessing. You were 
an amateur and didn’t know 
enough to cover your tracks com- 
pletely. My only problem was to 
prove the matter to the judge and 
you were kind enough to help us 
there, in your ignorance of the 
robotics you claim to despise.” 

there any purpose in this 

•*- discussion?” asked Ninhei- 
mer wearily. 

“For me, yes,” said Susan Cal- 
vin, “because I want you to un- 
derstand how completely you have 
misjudged robots. You silenced 
Easy by telling him that if he told 
anyone about your own distortion 
of the book, you would lose your 
job. That set up a certain poten- 



GALLEY SLAVE 



39 




tial within Easy toward silence, 
one that was strong enough to re- 
sist our efforts to break it down. 
We would have damaged the brain 
if we had persisted. 

“On the witness stand, however, 
you yourself put up a higher coun- 
ter-potential. You said that be- 
cause people would think that you, 
not a robot, had written the dis- 
puted passages in the book, you 
would lose far more than just your 
job. You would lose your repu- 
tation, your standing, your respect, 
your reason for living. You would 
lose the memory of you after 
death. A new and higher poten- 
tial was set up by you— and Easy 
talked.” 

“Oh, God,” said Ninheimer, 
turning his head away. 

Calvin was inexorable. She said, 
“Do you understand why he 
talked? It was not to accuse you, 
but to defend you! It can be 
mathematically shown that he was 
about to assume full blame for 
your crime, to deny that you had 
anything to do with it The First 
Law required that. He was going to 
lie— to damage himself— to bring 
monetary harm to a corporation. 
All that meant less to him than 
did the saving of you. If you really 
understood robots and robotics, 
you would have let him talk. But 
you did not understand, as I was 
sure you wouldn’t, as I guaran- 
teed to the defense attorney that 
you wouldn’t You were certain. 



in your hatred of robots, that Easy 
would act as a human being would 
act and defend itself at your ex- 
pense. So you flared out at him 
in panic— and destroyed yourself.” 
Ninheimer said with feeling, “I 
hope some day your robots turn 
on you and kill you!” 

“Don’t be foolish,” said Cal- 
vin. “Now I want you to explain 
why you’ve done all this.” 

Ninheimer grinned a distorted, 
humorless grin. “I am to dissect 
my mind, am I, for your intellec- 
tual curiosity, in return for im- 
munity from a charge of perjury?” 
“Put it that way if you like,” 
said Calvin emotionlessly. “But 
explain.” 

“So that you can counter future 
anti-robot attempts more efficient- 
ly? With greater understanding?” 
“I accept that” 

“You know,” said Ninheimer, 
“I'll tell you— just to watch it do 
you no good at all. You can’t un- 
derstand human motivation. You 
can only understand your damned 
machines because you’re a machine 
yourself, with skin on.” 

TT was breathing hard and there 
was no hesitation in his 
speech, no searching for precision. 
It was as though he had no further 
use for precision. 

He said, “For two hundred and 
fifty years, the machine has been 
replacing Man and destroying the 
hander aftsman. Pottery is spewed 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




out of molds and presses. Works 
of art have been replaced by iden- 
tical gimcracks stamped out on a 
die. Call it progress, if you wish! 
The artist is restricted to abstrac- 
tions, confined to the world of 
ideas. He must design something in 
mind— and then the machine does 
the rest. 

“Do you suppose the potter 
is content with mental creation? 
Do you suppose the idea is 
enough? That there is nothing in 
the feel of the clay itself, in watch- 
ing the thing grow as hand and 
mind work together? Do you sup- 
pose the actual growth doesn’t act 
as a feedback to modify and im- 
prove the idea?” 

“You are not a potter,” said Dr. 
Calvin. 

“I am a creative artist! I de- 
sign and build articles and books. 
There is more to it than the mere 
thinking of words and of putting 
them in the right order. If that 
were all, there would be no pleas- 
ure in it, no return. 

“A book should take shape in 
the hands of the writer. One must 
actually see the chapters grow and 
develop. One must work and re- 
work and watch the changes take 
place beyond the original concept 
even. There is taking the galleys 
in hand and seeing how the sen- 
tences look in print and molding 
them again. There are a hundred 
contacts between a man and his 



work at every stage of the game— 
and the contact itself is pleasur- 
able and repays a man for the 
work he puts into his creation 
more than anything else could. 
Your robot would take all that 
away.” 

“So does a typewriter. So does 
a printing press. Do you propose 
to return to the hand-illumination 
of manuscripts?” 

“Typewriters and printing 
presses take away some, but your 
robot would deprive us of all. 
Your robot takes over the galleys. 
Soon it, or other robots, would 
take over the original writing, the 
searching of the sources, the check- 
ing and cross-checking of passages, 
perhaps even the deduction of con- 
clusions. What would that leave 
the scholar? One thing only— the 
barren decisions concerning wliat 
orders to give the robot next! I 
want to save the future generations 
of the world of scholarship from 
such a final hell. That meant more 
to me than even my own reputa- 
tion and so I set out to destroy 
U. S. Robots by whatever means.” 

“You were bound to fail,” said 
Susan Calvin. 

“I was bound to try,” said Simon 
Ninheimer. 

Calvin turned and left. She did 
her best to feel no pang of sym- 
pathy for the broken man. 

She did not entirely succeed.

SANCTUARY 



By WILLIAM TENN

or a martyr? Put him to this test 
— time travel wounds all heels! 



Illustrated by MARTINEZ 



T HE cry was in a deep voice, 
a breathless, badly fright- 
ened voice. Hoarse and ur- 
gent, it rose above the roar of the 
distant mob, above the rattle of 
traffic; it flung itself into the spa- 
cious office on the third floor of the 
Embassy and demanded imme- 
diate attention. 

His Excellency, the Ambassador 
from 2219 A.D.— the sole occupant 
of that office— was a man of re- 
laxed bearing and a wonderfully 
calm face. His eyes transmitted the 
unvarying message that all things 
were essentially simple— and could 



be further simplified. It was, there- 
fore, quite remarkable how that 
cry from the grounds below made 
him look suddenly uncertain. 

He rose and moved to the win- 
dow with unaccustomed haste. A 
tall, bearded man, whose clothes 
were torn and whose body was 
badly bruised, had just leaped onto 
the Embassy lawn from the sur- 
rounding high fence. The bearded 
man pointed the forefingers of both 
hands at the third-floor office of 
the Ambassador from 2219 A.D. 
and shrieked again: 

“Sanctuary!” 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




There was an answering shriek 
from the mob cascading down the 
street toward him. The bearded 
man looked over his shoulder once, 
then leaped forward across the 
lawn. His feet could be heard 
pounding up the steps of the Em- 
bassy. Downstairs, a heavy door 
slammed behind him. 

The Ambassador from 2219 
A.D. bit his lip. Well, the fellow 
had made it. Now his problems be- 
gan. 

He turned a dial on his wrist 
communicator. “All Embassy per- 
sonnel,” he said. “Attention! This 
is the Ambassador speaking. Bolt 
and barricade all street doors im- 
mediately! Barricade all windows 
on the street level that are not 
protected by bars. All female per- 
sonnel and the fugitive who has 
just entered will be sent up to the 
second floor. Havemeyer, take 
charge of the first floor. Bruce, 
take charge of the second floor— 
and keep the fugitive under careful 
guard. Dodson, report to me.” 

TJE turned the dial another 
notch. “Police Department? 
This is the Ambassador from 2219 
A.D. A fugitive has just entered 
the building, requesting sanctuary. 
From the looks of the mob behind 
him, I'd say that your normal de- 
tail down here will be inadequate 
to protect us. You will have to 
send reinforcements.” 

The policeman’s snort was as 



much anger as surprise. “You’re 
giving sanctuary to Henry Grop- 
pus and you want us to protect 
you? Listen, I live in this time! It’s 
as much as my life is worth to—” 

“It’s as much as your job is 
worth if a riot detail isn’t down 
here in two minutes. Two minutes, 
I said. It is now precisely twenty- 
seven minutes past six o’clock.” 

“But listen!” The voice from 
the dial seemed almost hysterical. 
“That’s Henry Groppus you have 
in there. Do you know what he 
did?” 

“At the moment, that’s not rele- 
vant. If his request for asylum 
isn’t honored, he will be returned 
to the proper authorities. I am 
asking protection for the Embassy 
from 2219 A.D., for its property 
and personnel, which, like all Em- 
bassies and their staffs, enjoy ex- 
traterritorial status and immunity. 
It’s your responsibility to see that 
we get it.” 

The Ambassador clicked off and 
drew a deep breath. His calm was 
returning and once more his eyes 
announced that all complex mat- 
ters could be refined down to 
simple ones— and handled. 

As he turned to the window 
again, Dodson, his First Secretary, 
came in and stood respectfully at 
his shoulder. 

Together, they stared down at 
the mob, the relaxed, observant 
older man and the slender, alert 
young one who split his gaze be- 



SANCTUARY 



43 




tween the scene below and his 
chief. 

As far as the eye could see, in all 
directions, the street was the color 
of the yelling mob. It had pushed 
right up against the fence, so hard 
and so tight that those in front 
were unable to climb it as they had 
intended, but were jammed, 
screaming their agony, into the 
iron bars. 

“The police detail on duty, sir,” 
Dodson said in a low voice. “They 
weren’t able to hold them back for 
more than a few seconds. But they 
gave us time we needed. Every- 
thing downstairs should be secure, 
sir.” 

The Ambassador grunted. 

Now the fence was giving way. 
It bent slowly, steadily inward, like 
a black flower closing. And then 
it was down here and the mob 
spilled over it, down there and a 
thick wave of mob washed across 
the lawn, down everywhere, mob 
over it everywhere, mob rushing 
toward the building in which they 
stood, mob maddened and swirling 
all about them and breaking thun- 
derously against the walls. 

T? OR just a moment, Dodson was 
looking contemptuously down 
through the window. “2119 A.D.!” 

The Ambassador grunted again. 
The grunt could be taken any 
one of several ways. 

The frenzied, directionless noise 
from below abruptly changed in 



quality. It became steady, rhyth- 
mical. At the peak of each pulsa- 
tion, there was an enormous thump. 
After a while, the thumps were 
followed by a ripping sound. 

“Sir!” Havemeyer’s voice came 
in suddenly on the wrist commu- 
nicator. “The front door’s begin- 
ning to give way. All right if we 
move up to the second floor?” 

“By all means. And as soon as 
you’re up there, you and Bruce 
see to it that the doors, front and 
rear, are barricaded. Then I want 
you to stand by the destructive 
fuses on the Embassy files. If the 
mob breaks into the second floor, 
see to it that the files go.” 

“Right, sir.” 

“Do you think, sir, that there’s 
any chance—” Dodson had begun, 
when the sound of a dozen sirens 
made them look up. 

The riot squad was coming 
down from the sky on flying plat- 
forms, two men to a platform. 
Soupy yellow stuff flowed out of 
the nozzles of the canisters each 
policeman carried, flowed out and 
bubbled into the mob. 

The Ambassador looked at his 
watch. “One minute and fifty sec- 
onds,” he said comfortably. Then 
he went back to his desk. 

Dodson stood at the window, 
watching the mob stumble back 
across the Embassy lawn in chokes 
and gasps. Above all, he was fasci- 
nated by the number of individuals 
who, in the midst of their choking, 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




stopped and turned and shook 
their fists at the building behind 
them. 

When he could tear himself 
away, he described them to his 
chief. 

“They evidently feel pretty 
strongly, sir,” he suggested. “This 
is no ordinary mob.” 

“No, it’s no ordinary mob. And 
Groppus is no ordinary criminal. 
Send him in. Tell Havemeyer and 
Bruce to start straightening up the 
place. I want an itemized state- 
ment on all damage to be for- 
warded to the Secretary of State 
before five o’clock.” 

“Yes, sir.” Dodson paused near 
the door. “You know, sir, the staff 
received him inside as something 
of a hero.” 

The Ambassador looked up, his 
calm eyes slightly intent. “Of 
course they did. How did you feel 
about him, Dodson— criminal or 
hero?” 

The secretary’s face went im- 
mediately blank as his burgeoning 
diplomat’s mind tried to blunt the 
question. “Well, of course, sir, he’s 
both— both criminal and hero.” 

“Yes, but which is he chiefly? 
Take a stand, Dodson. How did 
you feel about him? Off the record, 
naturally.” 

“Well, sir,” the young man be- 
gan, then hesitated. “I think the 
dictum that applies here is When 
in Rome . We are, in effect, in 
Rome. Therefore, Henry Grop- 



pus should undoubtedly be con- 
sidered a criminal.” 

“Yes,” the Ambassador said 
thoughtfully. “In Rome. All right, 
send him in, send him in.” 

‘PkODSON left. The Ambassador 
sat back and stared at the 
ceiling — calmly. Then he got up 
and paced back and forth across 
the office— calmly. Then he went 
back to his desk, opened a heavy, 
gray-bound book, skimmed through 
a few pages in it and finally leaned 
forward, drumming his fingers on 
the polished desktop — calmly, 
very calmly. 

His wrist communicator buzzed. 
He flipped it on. 

“Your Excellency, this is the 
Secretary of State,” said a formal, 
moistureless voice. 

“Good afternoon, Mr. Secre- 
tary,” said the Ambassador, with 
equal formality. “What can I do 
for you?” 

“Your Excellency, according to 
information just received by my 
office, a certain Henry Hancock 
Groppus has escaped from the jail 
cell in which he was awaiting 
execution and taken shelter in your 
Embassy. I must ask you if this 
is true.” 

“That is true, Mr. Secretary, 
except for one small detail. At the 
time he entered the Embassy, he 
was not being pursued by lawfully 
constituted authority, but by an 
unlawful and ungoverned mob.” 



SANCTUARY 



45 




The voice in the communicator 
coughed an extremely dry cough. 
“I cannot regard this detail as be- 
ing relevant, Your Excellency. In 
the name of the government of 
the United States of America of 
2119 A.D.— to which government 
you are accredited and whose laws 
you are bound to respect— I must 
ask you to surrender the person 
of Henry Hancock Groppus, con- 
victed felon, to the justice of his 
country and his time.” 

“And I, Mr. Secretary,” the Am- 
bassador replied with equal dry 
urbanity, “as a representative and 
servant of United Earth of 2219 
A.D., must respectfully decline un- 
til I have had time to study the 
situation.” 

“In that case, Your Excellency, 
I regret to have to inform you of 
the extreme displeasure of my gov- 
ernment and our determination to 
take whatever steps are necessary 
to secure the person of Henry 
Hancock Groppus.” 

“Noted, Mr. Secretary,” said 
the Ambassador. 

There was a silence. “May I 
speak to you on the private chan- 
nel, Your Excellency?” 

“You may, Mr. Secretary. One 
moment, please.” 

The Ambassador from 2219 
A.D. pressed a button on his desk 
which locked his door and lit a 
Do Not Disturb indicator. Then 
he swung around and switched on 
the big screen behind his desk. 



A HEAVY-SET balding man 
appeared on it “Hi, Don,” he 
said. “This is one big stink we’re 
in.” 

“I know, Cleve,” the Ambassa- 
dor sighed. “A bigamy case. Capital 
offense.” 

“Bigamy, hell! Polygamy, Don 
boy! That’s what this joker’s been 
convicted of, polygamy. Advocat- 
ing, abetting and encompassing 
polygamy. You just don’t go any 
lower.” 

“In your time, you mean. In 
2199.” 

“In our time, yes. That’s the 
time we’re living in right now. 
The time that has to face the prob- 
lem of one woman to every ten 
men because of the genetic im- 
balance created by the last world 
war. All right, so we haven’t licked 
the Uterine Plague yet. We won’t 
lick it for another fifty years, ac- 
cording to you, though you won’t 
tell our medics how we finally will 
solve it.” 

The Ambassador gestured 
wearily at the screen. “You know 
as well as I, Cleve, there are things 
that Temporal Embassies can do 
and there are things they can’t 
do.” 

“Okay. Good. No argument 
You boys take your orders and 
have your problems. But we’ve got 
problems, too. Gigantic ones. We’ve 
got a social code that was designed 
in the days when there were equal 
numbers of men and women, and

it’s splitting at the seams every- 
where. We’ve got to persuade hun- 
dreds of millions of normal men 
that it’s right and proper for them 
to lead lives of the most madden- 
ing frustration if we want to keep 
civilization from dissolving into 
hand-to-hand battles. We’ve got 
them persuaded— about as well per- 
suaded as a herd of rutting ele- 
phants. And along comes this 
Henry Groppus and his hand- 
ful of crackpot Mendelists, mak- 
ing strange, sudden noises in the 
rear of the herd and—” 

“Slow down, Cleve. Take a deep 
breath. I know the kind of prob- 
lems your time is facing, perhaps 
better than you. I know it from 
the history I studied in school, and, 
since I’ve arrived here in 2119 as 
Ambassador from the Next Cen- 
tury, I’ve seen it sharp and bloodi- 
ly clear, at first hand. I know what 
an explosive danger the Mendelist 
philosophy is. I couldn’t be more 
sympathetic, I assure you. 

“Nonetheless, Cleve, you’re an 
important government official; 
you’re not the man in the street. 
2119 is grappling with the social 
effects of the Uterine Plague, and 
to 2119 it looks like the biggest 
thing that ever was. But 2119 is 
just a drop in the historical bucket. 
And so, for that matter,” he added 
in all fairness, “is 2219, my own 
period. Be just to your position and 
your intellect; look at the thing 
in perspective.” 



T V ’HE Secretary of State made 
a sluicing motion at the top 
of his bald head. “What perspec- 
tive? How perspective?” 

“Simply this, as an example. 
Take an Englishman of the upper 
middle class, a rich merchant, let 
us say. In the time of the Tudors, 
he’d be all for increasing the pow- 
ers of the king, all for an absolute 
monarchy, all for a very strong 
central government— the things that 
would damage his superiors, the 
feudal nobility, the most. A cen- 
tury later, when the nobility had 
been pretty much reduced to so 
much court decoration, his great- 
great-grandson would be fighting 
the absolutism of the Stuarts tooth 
and nail, insisting that the people 
had a right to call their king to 
account and that any government 
which was dictatorial deserved to 
be overthrown. 

“And a hundred years or so af- 
ter that, under the Hanoverian 
George^ III, his great-great-grand- 
son, looking across the channel to 
France, observing that the very 
common people there in the course 
of taking the same drastic action 
with their king had completely bol- 
lixed up industry, banking and 
commerce— he would be exclaim- 
ing his pious horror over regicides 
and calling for laws that would 
strengthen the government and 
keep revolutionaries in their place.” 

“The point being,” said the Sec- 
retary of State, “that most social 



SANCTUARY 



47 




values are conditioned by the time, 
place and prevailing political cli- 
mate. Is that what you mean by 
perspective?” 

“Exactly,” the Ambassador said 

The bald-headed man stared 
angrily out of the screen. “I wish 
I weren’t so upset It’s my mis- 
fortune to forget every dirty word 
I know when I get really mad. And 
this calls for— Look, Don, I don’t 
know very much about 2219, 
what’s important what’s sacred, 
what’s not to be touched. The rules 
of your outfit forbid you to give us 
a very clear picture of your time— 
and you’re a close-mouthed char- 
acter to begin with. But I’d give 
the goddam front lobe of my brain 
to see how you’d behave if some 
Henry Groppus of the twenty-third 
century did the future equivalent 
of polygamy in your neck of the 
woods. 

“You’d perspective him, you 
would. Now I’m not going to beat 
about the bush any more. Enough 
history, enough philosophy. Our 
government wouldn’t last a week if 
we let Mendelists get away with 
preaching their vicious nonsense, 
let alone committing overt acts. I 
hate to have to put it this way, 
Don, but the man is the vilest of 
criminals. You’re going to hand 
him over to us.” 

S MILING calmly, the Ambassa- 
dor from 2219 AX>. said, “I re- 
peat: he’s a criminal in your terms. 



Beyond that, I repeat: I have to 
study the situation. He had es- 
caped from prison; he was being 
pursued by a lynch mob; he took 
asylum in our Embassy, which is 
legally an enclave of 2219 in the 
present-day United States, an ex- 
tension of our time and govern- 
ment into yours. Don’t talk to me 
as if I were your office boy’s as- 
sistant, Cleve.” 

“A criminal is a criminal,” the 
bald-headed man went on dog- 
gedly. “ This criminal has got to 
be brought to justice. I’ve asked 
you for him on the record and off 
the record. Next step is formal ex- 
tradition papers. And the step after 
that— well, I won’t like to do it, but 
I will.” 

“I wouldn’t like you to do it, 
either,” said the Ambassador calm- 
ly and softly. 

Their eyes locked. The Secre- 
tary of State spread his hands. 
“Well, there it is,” he muttered, and 
he clicked off. 

Dodson and Groppus had been 
waiting patiently outside. When 
the Ambassador unlocked the door 
and nodded them in, he looked the 
bearded man over carefully. 

A thoroughly bewhiskered, 
messily eyebrowed and well- 
muscled person, perhaps a jot past 
middle age, he stood clumsily tall 
and stiffly erect in a manner slight- 
ly reminiscent of a military cadet 
who had arrived at the academy 
just the evening before.

His eyes were mild and apolo- 
getic, not at all fanatic and intense. 
They had a tendency to blink if 
you stared at them too hard. His 
hands were the most vibrant part 
of him. Even in comparative re- 
pose, when he was listening or 
thinking, they kept going through 
the repertoire of fluid, underlin- 
ing gestures of the practiced side- 
walk exhorter. 

“I suppose you know, Mr. Grop- 
pus, that you are already the sub- 
ject of a rather acrimonious con- 
troversy between your govern- 
ment and my Embassy?” said the 
Ambassador. 

“Not my government. I don’t 
recognize it as mine. I don’t admit 
its jurisdiction over me.” 

“Unfortunately, it feels different- 
ly. And it is larger, more powerful 
and more numerous than you. 
Please sit down.” 

Henry Groppus lowered his 
head and shook it from side to 
side slowly, a negative gesture 
that could make its point the entire 
length of a meeting hall. “I prefer 
to stand, thank you. I always 
stand. Size, power, numbers— since 
the beginning of time, those three 
have been trying to correlate with 
right and wrong. So far, they 
haven’t succeeded.” 

TVTODDING, the Ambassador 
^ murmured, “Very true. But, on 
the other hand, they do exceeding- 
ly well with life and death. Which, 



of course, brings us back to the 
present moment and you. As a 
convicted criminal under sentence 
of—” 

“I am not a criminal.” 

“You aren’t? In that case, Mr. 
Groppus, we have all been misled. 
I really must beg your pardon. 
Suppose you tell me then: how, 
precisely, do you visualize your 
role?” 

“As a political refugee! I come 
here, persecuted and cast out, to 
my true home and nation. I claim 
spiritual citizenship in 2219.” 
“Spiritual citizenship? That’s 
hardly the best kind. But putting 
that complex question aside for 
the moment, let me ask you, Mr. 
Groppus: what has given you the 
impression that my era shares your 
beliefs? The first rule of all Tem- 
poral Embassies is to transmit no 
information about the technologi- 
cal status and social attitudes of 
their own time to the period in 
which they are accredited. I fail 
to see what basis you have for—” 
“I always suspected that the fu- 
ture would be Mendelist, but I 
couldn’t be really sure. When the 
mob broke into the jail to lynch 
me and I got away from them, 
this was the only place I could 
think of hiding in. Now that I’ve 
been here for a while and seen 
you people— I know! The next cen- 
tury belongs to us!” 

The Ambassador looked com- 
pletely startled and unbelieving, as 



50 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




if he’d stubbed an emotion on a 
projecting rock. He shot a quick, 
questioning glance at his First Sec- 
retary. 

“I’m sorry, sir,” Dodson said in 
a low, rapid voice. “Bruce. It was 
his fault He was so busy barricad- 
ing the second floor against the 
mob that he neglected to take 
proper precautions. Some of the 
clerks came up to the prisoner 
during the excitement and got into 
conversation with him. By the time 
I reached him, the damage had 
been done.” 

“Some of the clerks—” His Ex- 
cellency fought with himself for 
a moment then squirted out an 
immense, protective cloud of calm. 
He said, after a deep breath, “I 
was under the impression that my 
staff was composed of trained em- 
ployees, regularly briefed as to 
their responsibilities. Well trained. 
Down to the very lowest echelons.” 

“Yes, sir, but these were three 
youngsters on their first extra-tem- 
poral assignment I’m not trying to 
make excuses for them, but it’s 
been very dull at the Embassy 
these last few months, especially 
for romantic kids who came out all 
hot and bothered at the idea of 
seeing history come alive and hap- 
pen. And then, all of a sudden, 
there’s a lynch mob and a siege 
of the Embassy. They find them- 
selves standing next to an actual 
twenty-second-century Mendelist 
Martyr in the flesh. Well, you 



know how it is, sir. They started 
out by asking excited, admiring 
questions— and ended up answering 
them.” 

r I "'HE Ambassador nodded grave- 
ly. “Groppus is the man to do 
just that. But after this affair has 
been cleared up, Vice-Consul 
Bruce and those three clerks will 
be the subject of an investigation 
and a report through Temporal 
Embassy channels clear to the end 
of the line.” 

Groppus, meanwhile, had wound 
himself up and was now running 
strong. 

“It had to be! It had to be!” he 
chanted, pacing up and down the 
office, his tom clothes whipping in 
the breeze created by his gesticu- 
lating hands. “We carried the word 
to the people and told them it had 
to be. If the Uterine Plague means 
that nine-tenths of all female chil- 
dren are still-born, does it follow 
that the remaining precious tenth 
should marry at random? No, we 
said. Such a thought stinks in the 
nostrils of evolution! 

“It’s not enough to require every 
prospective husband to show a cer- 
tificate of fecundity. We must go 
further! We must march under the 
slogan of a maximum genetic po- 
tential in every marriage. After 
all, we are not living in the dark- 
ness of the twentieth and twenty- 
first centuries! With modem 
eugenic methods, we can know 



SANCTUARY 



51 




exactly what we are getting in 
every fetus conceived. But even 
that is not enough. We must—” 

“All right,” said the Ambassa- 
dor from 2219 A.D. wearily, drop- 
ping into his chair and frowning 
at the desktop. “I am quite fa- 
miliar with the sentiments. I had 
them drummed into me all through 
childhood, and I had to memorize 
and repeat them all through my 
adolescence.” 

“Even that is not enough!” re- 
peated the bearded man, his voice 
rising majestically. “We must go 
further yet, we told them. We 
must turn a curse into a blessing, 
the Uterine Plague into a true 
genetic revival! If only the best 
should be allowed to reproduce, 
why not the best of the best? And 
if only the best of the best— if only 
the smallest, most refined nugget 
of mankind is to be allowed the 
privileges of further heredity—” 
here his voice sank to a dramatic 
whisper, before suddenly soaring 
up again— “surely we will not pre- 
sume to impose the ancient, out- 
worn limitation of one woman, one 
wife, one mate at a time? 

“Surely the race— stumbling and 
floundering in a deadly biological 
morass— deserves more than this 
mote, this snippet of aid? Doesn’t 
the next, the smaller generation, 
deserve the best of the previous, 
the larger generation, whatever 
custom may whine and morality 
may squeak to the contrary? We 



don’t preach sexual monopoly: we 
preach sexual salvation! And I 
say to you—” 

“Oh, Dodson, please take him 
out!” the Ambassador begged. “I 
have to think, and these grammar 
school recitations are giving me a 
headache!” 

A T the door, Groppus abruptly 
slid from his dizzy forensic 
heights and landed springily on his 
feet “So you won’t allow them to 
extradite me, Your Excellency? 
You won’t relinquish me to the 
justice of these primitives?” 

“I haven’t decided one way or 
the other. There’s more at stake 
than your person. I have to con- 
sider the matter carefully.” 

“Consider? Are you for light or 
for darkness? Are you for the fu- 
ture or the past? What is there 
to consider? I am a spiritual citi- 
zen, a philosophical forefather of 
2219 A.D. I have the right to 
sanctuary here— I demand that you 
give me asylum!” 

The Ambassador stared at him 
calmly. “Neither spiritual citizen- 
ship nor philosophical forebears 
are included in the category of' 
duties for which I am responsible. 
And I would like to point out to 
you, Mr. Groppus, that under in- 
ternational law— from which the 
body of extra-temporal law is de- 
rived— a fugitive’s rights of asylum 
are never implicit, but are depen- 
dent entirely upon the determ ina- 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




tion of the state to which he flees 
or the embassy of refuge in each 
separate case.” 

Dodson closed the door on the 
bearded man’s dawning expres- 
sion of consternation. 

When he returned, having de- 
posited Groppus with guards who 
were going to be very self-con- 
sciously uncommunicative, the Am- 
bassador told him of the threat 
contained in the Secretary of 
State’s last comment 

The young man swallowed. 
“That seems to imply that— that 
shortly after we’re served with ex- 
tradition papers, sir, a forcible 
entry of the Embassy will be made 
in order to remove the prisoner. 
But that’s unheard of!” 

“It may be the sort of thing that 
isn’t talked about much, but it 
certainly isn’t unheard of. It would 
mean, of course, that the Temporal 
Embassy would be permanently 
withdrawn from the United States 
of this era.” 

“Would they risk that, sir? After 
all, it’s their link with the future! 
We can’t give them all the infor- 
mation they want, but we do give 
them whatever knowledge the 
Temporal Embassies in our own 
time say is safe. And we take 
nothing in return. It would be 
idiotic for them to break relations.” 

The Ambassador studied a page 
in the gray-bound book on his 
desk. 

“Nothing which must be done is 



idiotic,” he said, largely to him- 
self. “Precedent after precedent. 
A matter of finding the right kind 
of spurious legality in which to 
cloak such action. And who is to 
say what is spurious or not about 
the reasons a sovereign state gives 
for taking drastic measures, if it 
believes that the measures are es- 
sential to its survival? A case like 
this, so intricately involved with 
mass frustration and the most basic 
problems of individual male 
egos . .” 

T\ ODSON was watching him 
closely. “So we give up the 
fugitive? I thought we would have 
to from the very beginning, if 
you’ll pardon me for saying so, 
sir. He is a criminal, no doubt 
about it. But it is going to be an 
uncomfortable business, very much 
like turning in a forefather, at that 
He thinks so much like us.” 

The young man rubbed a hand 
reflectively against a clean-shaven 
chin. “Even looks like us— I mean 
the way we looked back home in 
2219, before we were anachronised 
for the Embassy in this period. It’s 
amazing in how many petty and 
minor ways, as well as large and 
important ones, Groppus has an- 
ticipated our age.” 

His Excellency stood up and 
stretched at great length. “Non- 
sense, Dodson, nonsense! Don’t 
confuse cause with effect and real 
history with dramatic personalities.

Henry Groppus didn’t grow whisk- 
ers because he envisioned the pos- 
sibility that every man in our time 
will— that’s not the way it works at 
all. We go about bearded because 
our entire civilization is based on 
the Genetic File. And the concept 
of the Genetic File had its roots 
among the ideas of the twenty- 
second-century Mendelists— a mal- 
adjusted anti-social bunch who 
wore whiskers in a non-whiskered 
time as part of their general pro- 
test. 

“Put the utopian babblings of 
Henry Groppus up against the 
hard, workaday facts of the Ge- 
netic File in our age— do you see 
any real correspondence? Here 
and there, clumsily— as in Groppus 
advocating compulsory polygamy 
for genetic aristocrats, and in our 
society allowing an occasional, 
gifted* man, under special circum- 
stances, to take more than one wife. 
The sad truth about political 
saints of any given past is that 
nobody but a scholar will take the 
trouble to read their complete 
works and try to see them whole. 
But all this to one side: the Men- 
delists are political saints in our 
time and we can’t turn one of them 
in.” 

“I’m afraid I don’t follow you, 
sir,” Dodson objected. “You said 
just a moment ago that the pres- 
ent-day United States government 
felt so strongly about this matter 
that it was prepared to recover 



fugitives by force, even at the cost 
of breaking diplomatic relations 
with our time. Well, sir? And then 
there’s paragraph 16a of the Tem- 
poral Embassy By-laws: ‘. and 
above all the duty ot respecting 
the laws, the customs and the 
mores peculiar to the time in which 
an Embassy is accredited and of 
giving no offense whatsoever there- 
to’.” 

The Ambassador from 2219 
A.D. began emptying his desk, ex- 
plaining gently over his shoulder: 
“By-laws are one thing, Dodson. 
Natural laws are another. And the 
first and most fundamental natural 
law of a public servant is this: 
don’t bite the hand that feeds 
you. Don’t offend the sensibilities 
of the government officials who 
employ you. And above all, don’t 
offend the sensibilities of the pub- 
lic who employs them. If I turned 
Groppus in, I would receive the 
heartfelt appreciation of this period 
—and never get another diplomatic 
appointment from 2219 A.D. 
That’s the basis on which I final- 
ly made my decision. 

“So we simplify things. We close 
down the Embassy before even the 
extradition warrant arrives, and 
we leave, with all our personnel, 
papers and our precious fugitive, 
through the emergency chrondro- 
mos in the basement Back in our 
time, we make the necessary ex- 
planations, they make the neces- 
sary apologies to this period, and,

after a necessary interval has 
elapsed and memories have 
dimmed a bit, a new Temporal 
Ambassador from 2219 A.D. is 
appointed — one who will swear 
upon his arrival that he would ab- 
solutely never dream of obstruct- 
ing justice. Everyone’s face is 
saved.” 

He chucklingly prodded the as- 
tonished First Secretary in the 
ribs with the gray-bound Casebook 
of Extra-temporal Law. “Jump, 
my boy, jump! The Embassy has 
to be ready to move out of here 
in an hour. And Havemeyer has 
to check out the scientific prob- 
lems involved in bringing Henry 
Groppus into the future! And you 
have to write out a visa for him!” 

r I 'HREE weeks later— or, to be 
-*■ exact, one hundred years and 
three weeks later— Dodson called 
on the Ambassador, who was pack- 
ing busily, having just been ap- 
pointed to the Embassy on Gany- 
mede. Both men scratched from 
time to time at newly sprouted hair 
on their faces. 

“Have you heard, sir? About 
Groppus? He finally did it!” 

“Did what, my boy? The last 
I heard, he was going from tri- 
umph to triumph. Adoring crowds 
everywhere. A speech at the Monu- 
ment to the Mendelist Martyrs. 
Another speech on the steps of the 
North American Genetic File, 
tearfully hailing the concrete 



reality of a dream hallowed in 
blood— or some such moist meta- 
phor.” 

The young man shook his head 
excitedly. “That’s what I mean. 
After the speech on the steps of 
the North American Genetic File 
last week, he went inside with a 
flourish and made out an appli- 
cation for a fatherhood certificate 
—just in case, he explained, he ran 
into a woman he wanted to mar- 
ry. Well, this morning the Genetic 
File completed its regulation chro- 
mosome survey on him— and he 
was turned down! Too many un- 
stable patterns, said the voucher. 
But that’s nothing, sir, nothing! 
What do you think he did fifteen 
minutes ago?” 

“I don’t know.” The Ambassa- 
dor shrugged. “Blew up the Ge- 
netic File?” 

“That’s exactly what he did! He 
made up the explosive himself, he 
said. He claimed he had to free 
mankind from the tyranny of 
eugenic red tape. He destroyed the 
File completely, sir!” 

He sat down heavily. 

The Ambassador’s face had gone 
white. “But,” he whispered, “but 
—the Genetic File! The only com- 
plete genetic record of every in- 
dividual in North America! The 
basis of our civilization!” 

“Isn’t it— Isn’t it—” Dodson gave 
up trying to express the calamity 
in words. He clenched his fists. 
“He’s under heavy guard. But I

can tell you this, sir, and Fm not 
the only one who feels that way— 
he’ll never live to face sentence. 
Not if I know 2219 A.D.!” 

r |' 1 HE cry was in a deep voice, 
a breathless, badly frightened 
voice. Hoarse and urgent, it rose 
above the roar of the distant mob, 
above the rattle of traffic; it flung 
itself into the spacious office on 
the third floor of the Embassy and 
demanded immediate attention. 

His Excellency, the Ambassa- 
dor from 2319 A.D.— the sole oc- 
cupant of that office— was a man 
of tense bearing and an extreme- 
ly strained face. His eyes trans- 
mitted the unvarying message that 



all things were essentially com- 
plex— and might be further com- 
plicated. It was, therefore, not at 
all remarkable how that cry from 
the grounds below made him look 
suddenly uncertain. 

He rose and moved to the win- 
dow with his usual haste. A tall, 
bearded man, whose clothes were 
tom and whose body was badly 
bruised, had just leaped onto the 
Embassy lawn from the surround- 
ing high fence. The bearded man 
pointed the forefingers of both 
hands at the third-floor office of 
the Ambassador from 2319 A.D. 
and shrieked again:

The visitor closed the folder, 
looked at the Chief of the Depart- 
ment and asked, “Only one hour 
for weightlessness?” and the Chief 
started explaining. 

This visit is not an imaginary 
one, taking place on “a summer 
day in 1977.” The date was the 
31st of May, 1957; the place was 
the School of Aviation Medi-

cine, United States Air Force 
( Samusaf ), located at Randolph 
Air Force Base near San Antonio, 
Texas, commanded by Major Gen- 
eral Otis O. Benson, Jr. I, with 
General Benson’s permission, was 
the visitor. 

The curriculum is a real one, 
the Department of Space Medi- 
cine is one uf the Departments of 
Samusaf, and its Chief is Profes- 
sor Hubertus Strughold, M.D., 
PhD., with whom I had smorgas- 
bord the next night, prior to taking 
off for the place which calls itself, 
unofficially and proudly, Rocket 
City, even though the prosaic Post 
Office Department keeps, calling 
it Huntsville, Alabama. 

jC 1 STABLISHMENTS like the 
Department of Space Medi- 
cine do not happen by accident. 
They come into existence gradual- 
ly. Hence they have a history, and 
in the case of something which is 
part of the U. S. Air Force, but 
headed by a former German, there 
are several lines to this history. 

The beginning at the American 
end was the appointment, by the 
Adjutant General of the Army, of 
a board of medical officers. The 
board met for the first time in the 
fall of 1917 and began to think 
about its job, which was to study 
the “selection and maintenance” 
of pilots and to make the neces- 
sary recommendations. The first 
recommendation of the board was 



the establishment of a medical re- 
search laboratory which, in time, 
grew into the School of Aviation 
Medicine of the U. S. Air Force. 

As the Surgeon General of the 
Air Force, General Harry G. Arm- 
strong, pointed out later, the School 
of Aviation Medicine happens to 
be older than its parent, the Air 
Force, because at the time the 
medical research laboratory was 
established, U. S. military flying 
was a part of the Army’s Signal 
Corps. 

But, of course, during the re- 
maining days of the First World 
War, the inter-war period and dur- 
ing the Second World War, at 
which time General Armstrong was 
a colonel at Wright Field, the 
School of Aviation Medicine had 
both feet firmly on the ground and 
its head not much higher than the 
clouds. Space was still firmly re- 
served for the science fiction writ- 
ers who were not aware* that the 
people now in Rocket City, then 
at Peenemiinde on Usedom at the 
Baltic Sea, were getting ready to 
shoot into space. Space Medicine 
did not yet exist at Randolph Air 
Force Base. 

The beginning at the other end 
consisted very simply in the fact 
that a student who was interested 
in flying and whose name hap- 
pened to be Hubertus Strughold 
got himself a Ph.D. in physiology 
and also an M.D. degree in prepa- 
ration for an academic career.

I may add here by way of ex- 
planation that a physiologist could 
not teach physiology to medical 
students in a German university 
if he did not have an M.D. de- 
gree. The same applied to the men 
who taught pharmacology or toxi- 
cology; the anatomist could be a 
possible exception with a PhD. 
instead of an M.D., but he then 
officially belonged to the Depart- 
ment of Zoology. 

In 1927, young Professor Strug- 
hold started a rather daring inno- 
vation— he delivered a weekly lec- 
ture on aviation medicine. When 



telling me this, Strughold smiling- 
ly recalled that some people in his 
audience, especially (German) 
army officers, smiled in a different 
way and very politely shook then- 
heads. Lectures on aviation medi- 
cine! Who needs that? Those medi- 
cal people really overdid their 
specialization! But he kept lectur- 
ing on aviation medicine. 

i~kNLY six years after that first 
^ lecture, the Nazis came to 
power. The professor of physiology 
of the University of Wurzburg, Dr. 
Strughold, was suspect in their 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





eyes. He was not a party member, 
and if he was invited to join, he 
forgot all about it. Moreover, he 
was known to be a Roman Catho- 
lic. In spite of all this, he was made 
director of the Institute for Avia- 
tion Medicine in Berlin in 1935 
and held his post until 1945. 

It is a virtually unknown fact 
in this country that Goering, as 
head of the Luftwaffe, decreed in 
1942 that his airmen did not need 
any psychology and simply dis- 
banded the psychological depart- 
ments which existed. But the need 
for physiology was not doubted, 
even by Goering. The institute in 
Berlin was more or less left alone 
and the Allies, after the war, found 
nothing to criticize. 

Meanwhile, the University of 
Heidelberg was in severe need of 
teachers without a political past. 
Doctor Strughold became profes- 
sor of physiology at Heidelberg. 
This was in 1946. One year later, 
he had to request a leave to go to 
the School of Aviation Medicine in 
Texas. 

There followed a year of medi- 
cal teaching and of talks in all 
directions and in March, 1949, 
General Armstrong established the 
Department of Space Medicine (at 
first it was called the Department 
of Space Flight Medicine) because 
he was convinced— “for no special 
reason,” as he said— that “some day 
we will travel beyond the strato- 
sphere.” 



Space travel, to General Arnold, 
was the logical outcome of general 
progress and he wanted to be pre- 
pared for it in the medical field, 
especially since, in the past, medi- 
cine had quite often lagged be- 
hind engineering progress. 

The first project of the new de- 
partment was to think about a 
double proposition: (A) just what 
were the medical problems that 
would come up in flights beyond 
the atmosphere and (B) how 
much did we know about the cli- 
matic conditions (conducive to 
health and happiness or otherwise ) 
on other planets? 

For the first few years, most 
of the work consisted in thinking, 
with a little experimentation in 
high-altitude chambers thrown in. 
A number of reports and papers 
(mainly published in the Journal 
of Aviation Medicine) were the 
result. I’ll mention just two items 
from this early work. 

One was the realization that air 
travel had created a physiological 
novelty— namely that you can get 
“out of step” with the time in 
which you live. 

This factor could never have 
been noticed before; when you 
cross the Atlantic Ocean by ship, 
or the North American continent 
by train, you have to advance— or 
else to set back, depending on the 
direction in which you travel— your 
watch one hour every day. This 
is hardly noticed in the general

Dr. James G. Gaume explaining controls of Simulator. The aas bottle racks are attached

holiday atmosphere of an Atlantic 
crossing or in the general boredom 
of a long train ride. 

But if I take a non-stop flight 
from Idlewild Airport to Holly- 
wood, I am in for an awfully long 
day. 

WfHEN I take the DC-7 at 12 
** noon, New York time, I land 
at Los Angeles International Air- 
port at 8 PM, both according to my 
wristwatch and to my stomach. 
But the airport clock in Los An- 
geles says that it is 5 PM. My 
wristwatch can be adjusted in less 

62 



the cabin. 

than a minute. My stomach lacks 
such a mechanism. By 6 PM, local 
time, my stomach insists that I 
have missed dinner. By 7 PM, my 
stomach is satisfied, but I have the 
general feeling that I ate much 
too late. By 8 PM, local time, I 
think it is time to go to bed be- 
cause it feels (and physiologically 
it is) 11 pm. Unfortunately, the 
people around me think it is only 
8 pm and behave accordingly. 

If the DC-7 displaces me in time 
for about three hours for such a 
flight, the DC-8 or the Boeing 707 
will displace me for about six 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




hours. The body does adjust, at 
the rate of about one hour in 24, 
which is the reason it was never 
noticed in ship or train travel. 
Whatever lack of adjustment there 
wag left on arrival was blamed on 
general travel fatigue, with which, 
of course, it did blend. 

Now the fact of this discrepan- 
cy between physiological time and 
actual time is most important if 
the traveler has to be in top form 
immediately after arrival. Travel 
times then must be planned ac- 
cordingly or the traveler may lose 
out at the conference table, the 
concert hall or the sports field. 

The other item I want to men- 
tion is the concept of “space equiv- 
alent altitudes.” If a man, by magic, 
were suddenly transported to an 
altitude of, say, a thousand miles, 
he would die from “space ex- 
posure.” He would have no air to 
breathe, his skin would blister un- 
der the unshielded ultra-violet 
light from the Sun, he would be 
hit by a few cosmic rays and pos- 
sibly by a micro-meteorite, and, 
because of the lack of pressure, his 
warm body fluids would boil. 

I have used the expression “by 
magic” advisedly to indicate that I 
had instantaneous transportation 
in mind. In reality, this would not 
be instantaneous, and as the test 
person ascended into the atmos- 
phere, he would learn that the 
“space conditions” are not attained 
all together at the same moment, 



but that they would come into 
play one by one. 

Oxygen deficiency takes place 
soonest, beginning for some people 
at three miles, for others at four 
miles, but being complete for ab- 
solutely everybody at seven miles. 
There just is not enough oxygen 
to breathe; hence this particular 
space condition takes place fairly 
low in the atmosphere. (There are 
a number of complicating factors, 
but I trust Strughold will forgive 
me for skipping them, since 
Galaxy is not a medical journal.) 

The next altitude where a con- 
dition like one in space takes place 
is around 63,000 feet. At that 
height, the boiling point of water 
has dropped to around 36° C. or 
97° F. This is the temperature of 
the body fluids, so they begin to 
vaporize. The term “boiling,” origi- 
nally used, has now been aban- 
doned because it produces a mis- 
leading mental image. The current 
and, it is hoped, permanent term, 
is space ebullism, coined by using 
the Latin word ebullire which 
means “to bubble out.” 

Q OME authors have, often inad- 
^ vertently, caused the impres- 
sion that space ebullism will take 
place at a precise altitude. One 
might say they sounded as if the 
man were still safe at 62,998 feet 
and doomed at 63,002 feet This, 
of course, is nonsense and would 
make the danger point vary with 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



63 




geographical latitude. Furthermore, 
the vaporization arid bubble for- 
mation also depends on local pres- 
sures in the body (which is differ- 
ent, for example, in veins and in 
arteries) and on local heat, for dif- 
ferent parts of the body may have 
fairly distinct temperatures. 

Space ebullism will begin be- 
tween 63,000 and 63,500 feet and, 
for some parts of the body, up to 
67,000 feet. 

So this is another “space equiva- 
lent altitude,” but with a slight dif- 
ference. At 65,000 feet, the man 
would still be conscious for 10 to 
12 seconds and might be able to 
do something to save himself (if 
pressure is restored before that 
time is up, he will probably sur- 
vive) while in actual space the 
period of consciousness would be 
only 5 to 7 seconds. 

But, though at 65,000 feet you 
have reached two space equiva- 
lents (anoxia or more precisely 
anoxic anoxia, lack of enough oxy- 
gen; and space ebullism because of 
lack of pressure), the other space 
equivalents have not yet been 
reached. 

The atmosphere is still a fine 
protection against ultra-violet— that 
particular space equivalent altitude 
lies between 120,000 and 140,000 
feet— and against meteoric dust. 
The atmosphere does not become 
space equivalent with regard to 
meteorites below 80 miles. While 
the atmosphere as a whole reaches 



up for quite some distance, “space 
with some of its properties reaches 
down to 50,000 to 80,000 feet,” as 
Strughold puts it 

A LL this introduction was ne- 
cessary to show the things 
the Department of Space Medicine 
has to worry about. In the early 
years, incidentally, the staff of the 
department consisted of just three 
men, Prof. Strughold (physiolo- 
gy), Dr. Heinz Haber (physics 
and astronomy) and Dr. Buettner 
(meteorology). Later, Dr. Fritz 
Haber (engineering) was with the 
department for some time. 

Now the three men working di- 
rectly with Prof. Strughold are 
James G. Gaume (M.D.), Captain 
Emanuel M. Roth (M.D.) and 
Mr. Fenton Duepner (electronics 
engineering). But I must not for- 
get the department’s hard-work- 
ing secretary, Mrs. Margaret B. 
Niehaus who, among other things, 
is supposed to know where every- 
body is at a given moment, and 
usually does. 

What is at first confusing to a 
casual visitor is that several scien- 
tists whose work belongs into the 
concepts of space medicine do not 
belong to the department, even 
though they are at Randolph Air 
Force Base. For example, George 
T. Hauty (Ph.D.) belongs to the 
Department of Experimental Psy- 
chology, while the psychologist 
Siegfried J. Gerathewohl (PhD.) 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




is in the Department of Ophthal- 
mology and Hans-Georg Clamann 
(M.D.) is in the Physiology-Bio- 
physics Department. 

After I had made some official 
and some private visits and 
brought myself more or less up to 
date on personnel and areas of re- 
search, Prof. Strughold asked me, 
“What do you want to see first— 
Mars in a jar or the spaceship in 
the basement?” Since Mars in a 
jar was one floor closer, I decided 
on that. 

r ¥ 1 HE surface conditions of Mars, 
as you probably know, are as 
follows: Air pressure like that in 
our atmosphere eleven miles up, 
but with a different composition— 
all nitrogen, that is, with a possible 
faint trace of oxygen and a rela- 
tive humidity of not quite one per 
cent. Daytime temperature up to 
70° F., nighttime temperature be- 
low minus 40° F., surface gravity 
0.38 that of Earth. 

Except for the lower gravity, all 
this can be duplicated in a re- 
stricted space. The restricted 
spaces in use look very much like 
large pickle jars. They hold soil 
and rock of a type we would ex- 
pect to crunch underfoot on Mars. 
Their atmosphere is nitrogen of 
sufficiently low density with a trace 
of water vapor. During the day, 
the jars stand on shelves in the 
air-conditioned rooms and are per- 
mitted to warm up to 70 to 75° F. 



In the evening, they are put into 
a very cold super refrigerator. 

Fortunately, the difference be- 
tween Earth day and Martian day 
is only 37 minutes and about 23 
seconds, which can be disregarded. 

The “inhabitants” of the Mars 
jars are only bacteria, so far. The 
interesting point is that they are 
inhabitants, for they can live un- 
der these conditions. It seems that 
whenever a new colony of bacteria 
is introduced to Mars, a large num- 
ber of them die off, but the tougher 
survivors soon increase the popu- 
lation figure again. 

Next to the Mars jars, inciden- 
tally, there was apparatus with al- 
gae busily producing oxygen. 

“Chlorella?” I asked, because all 
such work I have ever read about 
had been with chlorella algae. 

“No,” was the answer, “this is 
Nostoc.” And since I did not an- 
swer at once, the speaker (I believe 
he was Lt. John A. Kooistra, Jr., 
but wouldn’t swear to it) contin- 
ued : “This does not mean that we 
think Nostoc will be the last word, 
but it is our starting point.” 

My silence had had an entirely 
different reason, however. Nostoc 
is virtually a childhood friend of 
mine. After Krakatoa blew up in 
1883, completely sterilizing itself, 
the ruins of that island were re- 
settled by living things. The first 
living thing to establish itself on 
the bare volcanic rock was Nos- 
toc, which seems to be about as 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



65 




hardy an explorer and settler as 
Man himself. 

“All we have to do now,” mused 
somebody, “is to teach these algae 
a few things. They have to learn 
to live on human waste materials, 
to swallow clouds of carbon 
dioxide, to produce clouds of pure 
oxygen, to reproduce quickly and 
not succumb to accidental poison- 
ing, to thrive under zero-g and be- 
come edible in several different 
flavors” 

It was not completely a joke. It 
is perfectly possible for algae to 
do every bit of this. All you need 
to do is to find, or breed, the right 
strains. 

E climbed down to the base- 
ment, where the Department 
of Space Medicine has built itself 
a spaceship. Like the proverbial 
boat in the cellar, they couldn’t 
get it out in one piece, if at all, 
even though it is not a whole 
spaceship but merely a spaceship 
cabin. It began as a project several 
years ago under the name of 
Sealed Cabin; now that it is a 
reality, it is known under the more 
appropriate name of Space Cabin 
Simulator. 

It is made of steel and the in- 
side air space is 110 cubic feet. 
Outside the Simulator, the base- 
ment air is an even air-conditioned 
75° F. Inside the Simulator, after 
the steel door has been closed, it 
can be anything Dr. Gaume wants 



it to be. My first question was what 
will happen if nothing is done. The 
result is about what one should ex- 
pect. After three hours, the inside 
temperature is up to about 95 
degrees and the relative humidity 
is around the same figure. If I 
remember correctly, it trails a bit 
behind, but not much. 

The external shape of the Space 
Cabin Simulator is not at all easy 
to describe. The main part of it is 
a wide steel cylinder standing on 
end. In front, a boxlike shape is 
attached to this cylinder. You en- 
ter through this section. 

The man who serves as a test 
subject sits facing the (closed) 
door. If the test lasts long— some 
men have been inside for over 24 
hours— the chair opens out into a 
six-foot bed. If the test subject 
wants to sleep, the scientists don’t 
mind at all, but he must be able 
to sleep with the lights on, for he 
is, after all, under observation 
whether awake or asleep. To the 
left of the test subject, there is a 
small airlock through which meals 
can be passed inside. 

All the control equipment is 
outside, partly for reasons of sim- 
plicity, partly for easy access in 
case something needs to be ad- 
justed or repaired. The simplest 
test would be that a man sits in- 
side for a number of hours with 
a supply of reading matter. His 
very presence ruins the atmosphere 
and the machinery’s job is to keep 




66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




the atmosphere in good repair. 

The man does three main things 
to the sealed air. He heats it up, 
he removes oxygen from it by 
breathing, and he adds carbon 
dioxide and water vapor, also by 
breathing, plus more water vapor 
by skin evaporation. The oxygen 
is replaced as it is used up, the car- 
bon dioxide is removed chemically, 
and the water vapor is removed by 
condensing it out in the air con- 
ditioner, which also removes the 
surplus heat. The air breathed by 
the man is always the same. 
Nothing is added but oxygen, 
nothing removed but heat, water 
vapor and carbon dioxide. 

This simple test is actually more 
a test of the machinery than of the 
man. But it has to begin that way. 
Only if you are sure that the ma- 
chinery can keep the air cool and 
breathable can you start introduc- 
ing variations. 

One elementary variation of this 
type is to permit the carbon di- 
oxide to accumulate. Eventually, 
in a spaceship, plants are to be 
called upon to absorb the carbon 
dioxide and a good deal of the 
moisture and to produce the 
oxygen for the crew. Plants can 
do with the very small amount of 
carbon dioxide normally in the 
air. They do better if the carbon 
dioxide content is somewhat higher. 
How high can it be permitted to 
get, for the sake of the plants, 
without harming the men? 



A NOTHER variation is to lower 
the pressure in the cabin. I 
don’t know what the simulated 
spaceship in the basement at Ran- 
dolph Air Force Base weighs, but 
a real spaceship cabin will have to 
be much lighter. Any engineer 
knows that there are spots in any 
structure where a leak may take 
place. He also knows that there 
may be a slow leak with 14 pounds 
of pressure on one side (and no 
pressure on the other), but that 
there may be no leak if the pres- 
sure is only 7 pounds per square 
inch. 

Before you can decide on build- 
ing such a lighter cabin for less in- 
side pressure, though, you have to 
find out how the man inside is 
doing. This is one of the many 
many possibilities where the Simu- 
lator comes in as a research in- 
strument. 

Reduce the total pressure inside 
the Simulator to 7 pounds per 
square inch. But vary the ratio be- 
tween nitrogen and oxygen in such 
a manner that the man still gets 
the same amount of oxygen with 
every breath he takes. How does 
the man react? Well, he doesn’t, 
which is to say that he feels fine. 

But there is now another prob- 
lem: the cabin air is much richer 
in oxygen than normal air. How 
much of a fire hazard is this richer 
oxygen mixture? The answer 
seems to be that there is no greater 
hazard that a fire may start just 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



67 




because there is more oxygen. But 
once a fire has started, the rate of 
combustion is much faster. 

Another problem : years ago, the 
Navy started experiments with a 
helium-oxygen atmosphere in div- 
ing suits. The reason is rather well 
known by now. Nitrogen dissolves 
in the blood (and body fluids gen- 
erally) under pressure; if the pres- 
sure is suddenly released, the nitro- 
gen forms bubbles in the fluids 
which cause the dangerous “bends.” 
Helium is absorbed under pressure 
to a far lesser extent and therefore 
there is far less dissolved gas to 
form bubbles. 

However, the helium bubbles 
happen to be larger than the nitro- 
gen bubbles. So the problem 
shapes up as follows: in a space- 
ship cabin, we might reduce the to- 
tal atmospheric pressure for engi- 
neering reasons. For the sake of the 



crew, we then change the compo- 
sition so that the spaceship atmos- 
phere is richer in oxygen. (For the 
sake of the plants, we might also 
permit the carbon dioxide fraction 
to grow larger.) But what do we 
use for the inert gas in the atmos- 
phere? Just helium? Or a mixture 
of helium and nitrogen in a pro- 
portion still to be established? Or 
use argon instead of nitrogen in 
such a mixture? 

These are the problems on hand. 
Some are already under investiga- 
tion. Some are on the list and their 
turn will come as soon as the cur- 
rent work is finished. True, to some 
extent these problems can be inves- 
tigated on paper. But there comes 
a time when you need observed 
facts. 

And then you start using the 
Space Cabin Simulator.

WHAT’S HE DOING IN THERE? 

By FRITZ LEIBER 

He went where no Martian ever 
went before — but would he come 
out — or had he gone for good? 

Illustrated By BOWMAN 



T HE Professor was con- 
gratulating Earth’s first visi- 
tor from another planet on 
his wisdom in getting in touch with 
a cultural anthropologist before 
contacting any other scientists (or 
governments, God forbid!), and in 
learning English from radio and 
TV before landing from his orbit- 
parked rocket, when the Martian 
stood up and said hesitantly, “Ex- 
cuse me, please, but where is it?” 



That baffled the Professor and 
the Martian seemed to grow 
anxious — at least his long mouth 
curved upward, and he had earlier 
explained that it curling downward 
was his smile— and he repeated, 
“Please, where is it?” 

He was surprisingly humanoid 
in most respects, but his com- 
plexion was textured so like the 
rich dark armchair he’d just been 
occupying that the Professor’s pin-

69 




striped gray suit, which he had 
eagerly consented to wear, seemed 
an arbitrary interruption between 
him and the chair — a sort of 
Mother Hubbard dress on a phan- 
tom conjured from its leather. 

The Professor’s Wife, always a 
perceptive hostess, came to her 
husband’s rescue by saying with 
equal rapidity, “Top of the stairs, 
end of the hall, last door.” 

The Martian’s mouth curled 
happily downward and he said, 
“Thank you very much,” and was 
off. 

Comprehension burst on the 
Professor. He caught up with his 
guest at the foot of the stairs. 

“Here, I’ll show you the way,” 
he said. 

“No, I can find it myself, thank 
you,” the Martian assured him. 

SOMETHING rather final in 
^ the Martian’s tone made the 
Professor desist, and after watch- 
ing his visitor sway up the stairs 
with an almost hypnotic softly 
jogging movement, he rejoined his 
wife in the study, saying wonder- 
ingly, “Who’d have thought it, by 
George! Function taboos as strict 
as our own!” 

“I’m glad some of your profes- 
sional visitors maintain ’em,” his 
wife said darkly. 

“But this one’s from Mars, dar- 
ling, and to find out he’s — well, 
similar in an aspect of his life is 
as thrilling as the discovery that 



water is burned hydrogen. When 
I think of the day not far distant 
when I’ll put his entries in the 
cross-cultural index . 

He was still rhapsodizing when 
the Professor’s Little Son raced in. 

“Pop, the Martian’s gone to the 
bathroom!” 

“Hush, dear. Manners.” 

“Now it’s perfectly natural, dar- 
ling, that the boy should notice 
and be excited. Yes, Son, the Mar- 
tian’s not so very different from 
us.” 

“Oh, certainly,” the Professor’s 
Wife said with a trace of bitter- 
ness. “I don’t imagine his turquoise 
complexion will cause any com- 
ment at all when you bring him to 
a faculty reception. They’ll just 
figure he’s had a hard night— and 
that he got that baby-elephant 
nose sniffing around for assistant 
professorships.” 

“Really, darling! He probably 
thinks of our noses as disagreeably 
amputated and paralyzed.” 

‘Well, anyway, Pop, he’s in the 
bathroom. I followed him when he 
squiggled upstairs.” 

“Now, Son, you shouldn’t have 
done that. He’s on a strange planet 
and it might make him nervous if 
he thought he was being spied on. 
We must show him every courtesy. 
By George, I can’t wait to discuss 
these things with Ackerly-Rams- 
bottom! When I think of how 
much more this encounter has to 
give the anthropologist than even

the physicist or astronomer . 

He was still going strong on his 
second rhapsody when he was in- 
terrupted by another high-speed 
entrance. It was the Professor’s 
Coltish Daughter. 

“Mom, Pop, the Martian’s—” 
“Hush, dear. We know.” 

The Professor’s Coltish Daugh- 
ter regained her adolescent poise, 
which was considerable. “Well, he’s 
still in there,” she said. “I just 
tried the door and it was locked.” 
“I’m glad it was!” the Professor 
said while his wife added, “Yes, 
you can’t be sure what—” and 
caught herself. “Really, dear, that 
was very bad manners.” 

“I thought he’d come downstairs 
long ago,” her daughter explained. 
“He’s been in there an awfully 
long time. It must have been a 
half hour ago that I saw him gyre 
and gimbal upstairs in that real 
gone way he has, with Nosy here 
following him.” The Professor’s 
Coltish Daughter was currently 
soaking up both jive and Alice. 

VKT HEN the Professor checked 
" his wristwatch, his expression 
grew troubled. “By George, he is 
taking his time! Though, of course, 
we don’t know how much time 
Martians ... I wonder.” 

“I listened for a while, Pop,” 
his son volunteered. “He was run- 
ning the water a lot.” 

“Running the water, eh? We 
know Mars is a water-starved 



planet. I suppose that in the pres- 
ence of unlimited water, he might 
be seized by a kind of madness 
and . But he seemed so well 
adjusted.” 

Then his wife spoke, voicing all 
their thoughts. Her outlook on life 
gave her a naturally sepulchral 
voice. 

“What’s he doing in there?” 

Twenty minutes and at least as 
many fantastic suggestions later, 
the Professor glanced again at his 
watch and nerved himself for ac- 
tion. Motioning his family aside, 
he mounted the stairs and tiptoed 
down the hall. 

He paused only once to shake 
his head and mutter under his 
breath, “By George, I wish I had 
Fenchurch or von Gottschalk here. 
They’re a shade better than I am 
on intercultural contracts, especial- 
ly taboo-breakings and affronts . .” 

His family followed him at a 
short distance. 

The Professor stopped in front 
of the bathroom door. Everything 
was quiet as death. 

He listened for a minute and 
then rapped measuredly, steadying 
his hand by clutching its wrist with 
the other. There was a faint splash- 
ing, but no other sound. 

Another minute passed. The 
Professor rapped again. Now there 
was no response at all. He very 
gingerly tried the knob. The door 
was still locked. 

When they had retreated to the 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




stairs, it was the Professor’s Wife 
who once more voiced their 
thoughts. This time her voice car- 
ried overtones of supernatural hor- 
ror. 

“What’s he doing in there?” 
“He may be dead or dying,” the 
Professor’s Coltish Daughter sug- 
gested briskly. “Maybe we ought 
to call the Fire Department, like 
they did for old Mrs. Frisbee.” 
The Professor winced. “I’m 
afraid you haven’t visualized the 
complications, dear,” he said gent- 
ly. “No one but ourselves knows 
that the Martian is on Earth, or 
has even the slightest inkling that 
interplanetary travel has been 
achieved. Whatever we do, it will 
have to be on our own. But to 
break in on a creature engaged in 
—well, we don’t know what primal 
private activity— is against all an- 
thropological practice. Still—” 

“Dying’s a primal activity,” his 
daughter said crisply. 

“So’s ritual bathing before mass 
murder,” his wife added. 

“Please! Still, as I was about to 
say, we do have the moral duty to 
succor him if, as you all too rea- 
sonably suggest, he has been in- 
capacitated by a germ or virus or, 
more likely, by some simple en- 
vironmental factor such as Earth’s 
greater gravity.” 

“Tell you what. Pop— I can look 
in the bathroom window and see 
what he’s doing. All I have to do 
is crawl out my bedroom window 



and along the gutter a little ways. 
It’s safe as houses.” 

rpHE Professor’s question begin- 
ning with, “Son, how do you 
know—” died unuttered and he re- 
fused to notice the words his 
daughter was voicing silently at 
her brother. He glanced at his 
wife’s sardonically composed face, 
thought once more of the Fire De- 
partment and of other and larger 
and even more jealous— or would 
it be skeptical?— government agen- 
cies, and clutched at the straw of- 
fered him. 

Ten minutes later, he was quite 
unnecessarily assisting his son back 
through the bedroom window. 

“Gee, Pop, I couldn’t see a sign 
of him. That’s why I took so long. 
Hey, Pop, don’t look so scared. 
He’s in there, sure enough. It’s 
just that the bathtub’s under the 
window and you have to get real 
close up to see into it.” 

“The Martian’s taking a bath?” 

“Yep. Got it full up and just 
the end of his little old schnozzle 
sticking out. Your suit, Pop, was 
hanging on the door.” 

The one word the Professor’s 
Wife spoke was like a death knell. 

“Drowned!” 

“No, Ma, I don’t think so. His 
schnozzle was opening and closing 
regular like.” 

“Maybe he’s a shape-changer,” 
the Professor’s Coltish Daughter 
said in a burst of evil fantasy. 



WHAT’S HE DOING IN THERE? 



73 




“Maybe he softens in water and 
thins out after a while until he’s 
like an eel and then he’ll go ex- 
ploring through the sewer pipes. 
Wouldn’t it be funny if he went 
under the street and knocked on 
the stopper from underneath and 
crawled into the bathtub with 
President Rexford, or Mrs. Presi- 
dent Rexford, or maybe right into 
the middle of one of Janey 
Rexford’s Oh-I’m-so-sexy bubble 
baths?” 

“Please!” The Professor put his 
hand to his eyebrows and kept 
it there, cuddling the elbow in his 
other hand. 

“Well, have you thought of 
something?” the Professor’s Wife 
asked him after a bit. “What are 
you going to do?” 

The Professor dropped his hand 
and blinked his eyes hard and 
took a deep breath. 

“Telegraph Fenchurch and Ack- 
erly-Ramsbottom and then break 
in,” he said in a resigned voice, 
into which, nevertheless, a note of 
hope seemed also to have come. 
“First, however, I’m going to wait 
until morning.” 

And he sat down cross-legged in 
the hall a few yards from the bath- 
room door and folded his arms. 

C O the long vigil commenced. 
^ The Professor’s family shared 
it and he offered no objection. 
Other and sterner men, he told 
himself, might claim to be able 



successfully to order their children 
to go to bed when there was a 
Martian locked in the bathroom, 
but he would like to see them 
faced with the situation. 

Finally dawn began to seep 
from the bedrooms. When the bulb 
in the hall had grown quite dim, 
the Professor unfolded his arms. 

Just then, there was a loud 
splashing in the bathroom. The 
Professor’s family looked toward 
the door. The splashing stopped 
and they heard the Martian mov- 
ing around. Then the door opened 
and the Martian appeared in the 
Professor’s gray pin-stripe suit. His 
mouth curled sharply downward 
in a broad alien smile as he saw 
the Professor. 

“Good morning!” the Martian 
said happily. “I never slept better 
in my life, even in my own little 
wet bed back on Mars.” 

He looked around more closely 
and his mouth straightened. “But 
where did you all sleep?” he asked. 
“Don’t tell me you stayed dry all 
night! You didn't give up your 
only bed to me?” 

His mouth curled upward in 
misery. “Oh, dear,” he said, “I’m 
afraid I’ve made a mistake some- 
how. Yet I don’t understand how. 
Before I studied you, I didn’t 
know what your sleeping habits 
would be, but that question was 
answered for me— in fact, it looked 
so reassuringly homelike— when I 
saw those brief TV scenes of your

If there were no better spaceships than those 
that belonged to Quantum— and there weren't— 
what were their competitors beating them with? 



T HE Chief called me in about 
ten that morning. With a 
sweep of the hand, he rat off 
all communication buttons with the 
rest of his subordinates, by which 
I knew that something big was stir- 
ring. 



“Carl,” he said, “do we or do 
we not ship chemicals to Mars 
from which the Earth Colony can 
make hard-to-get water and oxy- 
gen for their climate-restoration 
project?” 

I spoke right up. “We do.” 



76

He nodded his crew-cut, iron- 
gray head. “Do we not also carry 
mail at special mail rates for the 
Colonies on Mars and the Aster- 
oids?” 

“It brings in good money ” 

The Chief fingered one of our 



space tariffs, which gave rates on 
the thousand or so most essential 
Earth-manufactured items that we 
shipped to the Moon and Mars 
Colonies as well as to the new As- 
teroid groups. Scientific instru- 
ments needed to survive on strange 



PAYLOAD 



77 



planets. Special foods and clothing. 
Communication stuff. Even a few 
luxury items to make the Earth 
Colonists feel at home. 

“To do all this, Carl,” said the 
Chief, leaning back and closing 
his eyes, “we maintain a fleet of 
a dozen of the finest spaceships. 
We pay rental on three of the 
space stations, and we have an- 
other half-dozen new spaceships 
a-building.” 

I nodded. “Cost Accounting is 
worried about that, too, Chief. 
We’ve got almost two hundred 
million tied up there, and no mat- 
ter how many trips we make with 
full cargo, we can’t make money. 
The little profit we show has to be 
plowed back into equipment.” 

“It takes fourteen men, good and 
true, drawing fourteen salaries to 
run those ships,” he said. “Not 
roustabout salaries, but money paid 
to good technical men who will 
put up with the vicissitudes of 
space travel month in and month 
out.” 

WT OOK,” I said, growing impa- 
tient, “I know all about 
what it takes to run Quantum As- 
sociates. I dream those figures at 
night. With the last three rate 
boosts, we’ve finally gotten past 
the experimental stages of cost ac- 
counting and know what it costs 
us to deliver a pound of goods on 
Mars. The figures may seem fan- 
tastic to our customers, but the 



point to argue is that so far there 
is no return trade to spread the 
expense. When we find something 
valuable out there, we can fill our 
ships on the return sweep and 
lower shipping costs.” 

He smiled the sickly sweet smile 
that meant trouble. “And so we 
charge twenty-five hundred dol- 
lars a day running costs per ship 
in space.” 

I realized that he was quoting 
my new figures for the National 
Spaceloading contract. This was 
a purchasing firm, similar to the 
old railroad carloading companies 
that sold shipping space to small 
shippers at the higher less-than- 
carload rates, and shipped enough 
to send out full carloads at the 
lower rates and made their profit 
on the difference. We encouraged 
this, as it guaranteed full payloads 
on every trip. The National Space- 
loading contract was new and it 
was going to do a lot for Quantum 
Associates. 

“I can’t shave those figures. 
Chief. National Spaceloading has 
no complaint. Let them ask for a 
government subsidy if they can’t 
stand the new rate. We can’t go on 
losing—” 

He cut me dead. “You don’t 
have to shave those figures. The 
government won’t have to subsi- 
dize. We lost the National Space- 
loading contract.” 

“ What ! n 

I did a rapid mental calcula-

tion. There were two other com- 
panies competing with Quantum 
Associates, smaller than us. They 
had their hands full and were 
charging more than we were, since 
their original fleets hadn’t been 
amortized as ours was. 

“Who beat us?” I asked, baffled. 
“Julia Associates.” 

“Never heard of them.” 

“Neither have I. But they’ve de- 
livered the necessary hundred 
thousand tons of goods to the 
Moon station in order to establish 
their space-freight status, as re- 
quired by law. They’re quoting a 
flat hundred dollars a day in 
space.” 

“A hundred dollars a day ! ” 
“Against our twenty-five hun- 
dred,” said the Chief, smiling wry- 
ly. “You’d better zip up to the 
space station and see what the 
hell goes. With this kind of compe- 
tition, we’ll be grounding our en- 
tire fleet by November.” 

T GOT out of there fast. I made 
-*■ a noon reservation for the 
rocket blast to one of our space 
stations and threw a couple of 
things in a bag. Goods get shunted 
up there by the Short Freighters— 
that’s an Earth-rocket proposition, 
not space travel— and we take over 
at the space station, as do all space 
shippers. 

One thing was foremost in my 
mind. I was a young man in a 
young business. Like most of 



Quantum Associates, I had begun 
with Earth-rocket freighting, which 
is a very old business where you 
have as much chance to advance 
as a barnacle on the outside keel 
of an oceangoing liner. The im- 
portant positions in Earth-rocket- 
ing are darn near hereditary. They 
go to friends or relatives of the 
guys already in good spots. 

Space shipping, on the other 
hand, is as new as tomorrow’s 
spacecast. Carl Cummings— me— 
didn’t intend to be jarred loose 
from his new career by Julia As- 
sociates or anyone else. 

I paused long enough to get a 
quick Dunbrad on Julia Associates. 
Capitalization was very small, but 
shippers, with their insurance and 
bonding protection, don’t care 
about that. I found something 
more interesting. Frank Stresinger 
and Julia Stresinger, brother and 
sister, were listed as controlling 
company officers and owners. 

I never heard of Julia Stresin- 
ger, but the name of Frank Stresin- 
ger touched off a faint bell in my 
mind. 

Just before I loaded aboard the 
Earth rocket for the space station, 
I called our Legal Department to 
clarify my memory. 

I was right. There was a con- 
nection between Quantum and 
Stresinger. Two years before, 
Quantum Associates had had an 
employee of that name. 

Frank Stresinger was a space

engineer who’d been lost from one 
of our spaceships out on the As- 
teroid Belt In his lawsuit against 
the Company, he charged that 
while he was making some exterior 
repairs, our ship had taken off from 
under him, deserting him in space 
and causing him physical injury 
and mental distress, what with ex- 
posure to unknown cosmic rays 
and the mental harassment of the 
meteor danger. 

He had drifted two days before 
the mass of the asteroid which the 
ship had just visited finally exerted 
itself on his smaller mass, and he 
sank lightly back to the Asteroid 
Colony. 

A lucky escape. What’s more, 
we’d tried to pay him off for an 
incident that most space engineers 
would have laughed at, but he 
went ahead and sued. In the trial, 
we made him look pretty silly, 
pointing out that he had failed to 
notify anybody but the cook when 
he went outside, a clear violation 
of Company rules. He lost the 
suit. 

At the same time, the incident 
broke up some of the informality 
of crew life and we never lost a 
man after that, so we came out 
ahead all around. 

But I was bothered. Had he 
discovered something about space 
travel that the rest of us hadn’t? 
What had he found that allowed 
him to operate a spaceship on one 
hundred dollars a day? 



I^ATIONAL Spaceloading had 
’ just taken over one of the 
two dozen space stations original- 
ly built by the government for 
military purposes, but of less im- 
portance now that the Moon and 
Mars Colonies were well estab- 
lished. 

I went immediately to the Na- 
tional Spaceloading station instead 
of to the Quantum stations. I knew 
Halsey, the National Spaceloading 
traffic manager, from my old 
Earth-rocket days and went direct- 
ly to his office-living quarters. I 
found him knee-deep in manifests. 

“Gravitate elsewhere, Carl,” he 
told me. “I’m making shipments 
for Mars and the Asteroids, I’ve 
got to clear a thousand tons to- 
night. Tomorrow I’ll buy you a 
beer.” 

“Just asking a favor. How’s 
about sneaking me into one of the 
ships of Julia Associates for a look 
around?” 

He shot me a funny look. “Why 
don’t you ask Julia Associates? 
They’re down in the bar, waiting 
to take over our thousand-ton ship- 
ment for Mars.” 

“Well, at least you can tell me 
something about the ships—” 
Halsey scowled. “Listen, Carl. 
We’re not spacemen. We only as- 
semble shipments. We shove ’em 
off the station to the taxis. The 
taxis tow them to the spaceships 
just like at your own docks. Once 
the stuff is checked out of the 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




space station, I don’t worry about 
it any more.” 

“You’ve never been on one of 
their ships,” I said accusingly. 

“They take the goods from us 
and they deliver the goods to desti- 
nation. For a reasonable price- 
one that Quantum can’t meet, Carl. 
If they’re mysterious about their 
ships, that’s no problem of mine. 
For their rates, I ask no questions.” 

I took a stab in the dark. “They 
don’t have any ships,” I said. 

He gave me a neutral answer: 
“Get the hell out of here.” 

T WENT down to the bar. I 
found a scowling young man 
and a loose-legged young woman 
having some drinks. 

“Hi, friends,” I said. 

I got two cold nods. 

“I used to work for Quantum,” 
I said. I shoved back my sleeve 
to show the scar I got when I was 
a kid, working summers in Earth 
rockets. “I got hurt on a run last 
year and the Company wouldn’t 
do anything about it, the lousy 
rats.” 

No change in expression. 

“I heard you were shipping,” I 
said. “I need a job.” 

“Our crews are full,” said the 
guy. 

“How did you know we were 
shipping?” asked the girl. I im- 
mediately pegged her as the less 
hostile. 

“I’ve been scratching out an 



existence down yonder and keep- 
ing my ears working. And word 
gets around—” 

“Word couldn’t,” said the girl. 

“Nobody knows about us ex- 
cept National Spaceloading and 
possibly our rivals, Quantum As- 
sociates, who just lost a contract.” 
Frank Stresinger gave a nasty 
laugh. 

“All right,” I grinned. “I got a 
girl friend in the office of Harvey 
J. Mortimer at Quantum. She let 
it slip.” 

I was thinking of the prune- 
faced Miss Whelan and the Chief. 
The idea of the Chief having a 
pretty, young office decoration or 
of Miss Whelan with her thirty 
solid years of executive secretary- 
ship blabbing anything was a riot. 
But these people didn’t know that, 
and they didn’t know me. 

I thought the girl’s eyes softened 
a little. 

“Frank,” she said, “we could use 
a hired man.” 

Frank shook his head. “When I 
want a hired man, I’ll go find him 
myself. Nobody else need apply.” 

I mixed a drink for myself. You 
don’t have room in space stations 
for luxuries like bartenders. 

It was time to lay off. Some- 
times you can make a sale by just 
hanging around and not saying 
too much. I sat there staring out 
the window at Earth, trying to look 
worried and unemployed. My suc- 
cess was partial. Presently Julia

Associates got up to leave, and a 
twenty-dollar bill floated down in 
my lap. 

“We had it tough ourselves 
once,” said the girl. “Maybe this’ll 
help. Why don’t you try pho- 
tons, Inc., or Spacesavers? They 
hire sometimes.” 

The man jerked the girl’s arm. 
“Come on, Sis. He’s a spy. If he 
shows up near our shipment, I’ll 
blow his head off.” 

“I just hate to see anybody 
starve,” she said. 

Frank grunted and they left. 

HEN Halsey didn’t even in- 
vite me to supper, I taxied 
to Johanson’s grimy little place, 
which can hardly be dignified with 
the name of a space station. It was 
formerly used to house a big tele- 
scope in the early days, separate 
from the stations. Now they’ve got 
the fine observatories on the Moon. 

Johanson had converted the old 
structure as a base for his space 
taxi business, but there was hardly 
room for the taximen to rest their 
weary heads, exhausted after a day 
of bouncing passengers and cargo 
from one space station to another, 
or from the space stations to the 
spaceships proper. 

Like the rockets that brought 
people and things up to the sta- 
tions from Earth, the taxis were 
a separate operation from ours, 
but Johanson knew me well. He 
and I once pulled freight together 



in Earth rockets. I had a plan and 
hoped I wouldn’t run into him. 

I went in with my dummied-up 
bag of old newspapers in a mail 
container I stole from Halsey. 

“Mail for the Julia Associates 
for Mars,” I told the duty man. 

The bright-eyed kid on the 
Operations Desk didn’t know me. 
He gestured over his shoulder. 

“Dump her over there,” he said, 
indicating some other mail bags. 
“Taxi 202 will make the run out 
in a half-hour. That’s the last taxi 
out for them before takeoff.” 

I shook my head. “Got to have 
this bag signed for personally by 
Julia Associates. Special U. S. 
Mail.” 

“Our taximan’ll get the signa- 
ture.” 

“I’ve got to go to their ship,” 
I said. 

He looked at me funnywise. 
“Frank Stresinger doesn’t like 
strangers around his mooring. The 
Post Office will never know that 
you didn’t actually go and get 
the signature. Stay away from 
them, friend.” 

I shrugged. I might’ve argued 
further, but just then Old Johan- 
son came in with his hang-dog look 
from trying to satisfy too many 
people for too many years and 
dropped in a chair. “Hi, Carl,” he 
said. “How’s everything with 
Quantum Associates?” 

“Fine,” I said glumly. 

The young fellow snickered. “He 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




wanted to go out to the Julia As- 
sociates shipment. Wouldn’t Frank 
love that if he could catch a Quan- 
tum man out there? He’d shoot 
this guy’s pants off.” 

Johanson didn’t laugh. He got 
right up out of his chair. “You’d 
better leave them alone, Carl. That 
young punk is a little crazy. He’ll 
shoot you dead if you go out 
there.” 

That ended Plan One. I needed 
another. “Just curious,” I sighed, 
sitting on the desk. I pulled out a 
bottle of stuff I’d swiped from Hal- 
sey’s bar. “I suppose you taximen 
are still losing money so that all 
you can afford to drink is space- 
glue.” 

Johanson and the young guy 
both gave their eyeballs a treat at 
the sight of my bottle. 

“Black and Tan,” breathed the 
young man. 

“Real Black and Real Tan,” said 
Old Johanson, eyes aglitter, “is 
Real Good Scotch.” 

“Never mind the commercial,” 
I said, breaking the seal. 

As I poured the fire into the tin 
cup, Johanson said: “Remember, 
Carl, I ain’t taking you out to no 
Julia Associates shipment, nor none 
of my men.” 

A S it turned out, we got into a 
hot argument about the mail- 
bags. I claimed that it was perfect- 
ly legal for a man to buy postage 
and ship himself through space in 



a mailbag. Johanson doubted it. 
He’s a kind of space lawyer any- 
way, and he had all the rules at the 
tip of his tongue. But I proved it 
was physically possible by show- 
ing him that a man could comfort- 
ably fit into an empty mailbag. 

I put on my space helmet, which 
took care of the air problem. I 
snuggled down in comfort. From 
inside the bag, I could faintly hear 
Johanson and his young employee 
arguing the merits of the case. 

Presently Johanson said: “Say, 
what happened to Carl? He was 
here a minute ago.” 

“Don’t know. But he left his 
bottle. He’ll be back.” 

“He better come soon,” giggled 
the youth. “All of his Black is 
gone, and the Tan is gettin’ low!” 
Half an hour later, the taximan 
came in, sniffed the air, grumbled 
and loaded his mailbags into Taxi 
202, the last taxi to go to the Julia 
Associates shipment before take- 
off. He had no trouble loading me 
with the rest— inside Johanson’s 
cubbyhole, I had a weight of about 
two pounds due to centrifugal force 
of the structure’s rotation; outside 
of it, I was as weightless as the 
rest of the mail. 

We took off. 

The conversation at the round- 
up point was simple and brief. I 
could hear it because the headset 
in my space helmet was zeroed on 
“vicinity,” which is the way most 
radio space talkbacks work, in-

stead of by single frequencies. 

“This is all,” said the man. With 
the top down, he was chucking the 
mailbags over the side of the taxi. 

“It’s enough,” grumbled Frank 
Stresinger. “Now beat it.” 

“Thought I might wait around 
until you loaded onto your space- 
ship,” said the driver. “With all 
this stuff, you could use some help.” 
Then he gave a big guffaw. 

“Beat it.” 

“You got an awful big ship,” said 
the taximan. Then, frightened: 
“Okay, okay, take it easy. I’m just 
kidding.” 

And the taxi zoomed off, leav- 
ing the mailbags, including me, 
drifting there. 

I made then what was my first 
mistake and almost my last. I un- 
fastened the mailbag, stuck my 
helmeted head out of it and said 
over the radio: “Hi, Frank! Need 
some help?” 

I was only about twenty feet 
from him and he was bending 
over, standing on a large cargo box, 
doing something with a rope. He 
gave a cry of rage— “Spy!”— and 
dropped his rope and began to dig 
for his gun. Since I didn’t have 
any, I decided to remove myself 
as a target as quickly as possible. 

TT 1 ORTUNATELY, there was 
about an acre of boxes and 
bundles, all bumping together there 
in space, centering around its own 
mass, drifting gently Earthward. 



The reflected Earthlight was just 
dim enough for me to hope for 
security. I opened the jets on my 
shoulder harness and headed 
straight for the biggest bulk of 
crates— what looked like some of 
the oxygen-water manufacturing 
machines that Quantum Associates 
had hoped to be shipping to Mars. 

I cut my jets and scrambled 
into the blackness of the cargo, 
sliding in and around boxes like 
an ant diving into his hole. With 
a thousand tons of the stuff con- 
glomerated in a mass, it wasn’t 
hard to hide. I couldn’t hear 
Frank’s shots because there was no 
medium to transmit the sound 
waves, but I could feel the boxes 
vibrate where his probing shots 
hit them instead of me. Friendly 
cuss! 

He was digging madly in the 
boxes and I was burrowing deeper 
into the mass when Julia came 
alongside of him and I could hear 
the talk over my receiver. 

“Frank, we’ve got to get started.” 

“First I’m going to kill me a 
spy!” 

“You’ve got two months to hunt 
him out while we’re traveling. But 
we can’t waste even two hours go- 
ing through all of this cargo just 
now.” 

“Get Old William and Mary! I 
ain’t starting till he’s been taken 
care of!” 

“You and your hate-everybody 
routine,” she said. “I won't get 



84

them. They’re bilsy finishing the 
lashing job. Come on now.” 

“Give me just fifteen minutes 
—ten.” 

“I’ve already set the breeder- 
reactor. We start in five minutes, 
whether or not you’ve finished your 
part of the lashing.” 

Frank groaned and they moved 
off, arguing. 

I stayed hidden, deep in the 
darkness. In about five minutes, I 
felt an enormous tug. Then nothing. 

Space sensations are tricky. I 
had only my space station experi- 
ence to give me orientation— that 
three weeks I’d spent at the sta- 
tions, setting up a cost accounting 
system. But it felt funny. 

I clambered out of my hiding 
place and peered around to check 
up. Over the jumbled surface of 
the mass of shipping boxes, I could 
see the Earth behind us, dwindling 
as we accelerated, its yellow-green 
disk turning into nothing greater 
than an oversized moon. I caught 
my breath when I realized what 
speed we had reached. 

I looked up ahead and saw the 
Moon. It looked perfectly normal 
for a second— and then it jittered. 
We were really burning up space 
miles! 

I looked closer at hand, directly 
over the carpet of boxes and bags 
ahead of me, and finally saw the 
spaceship that Julia Associates 
used. 

A house-trailer! 



OU can imagine why I cursed 
that Black and Tan for several 
minutes before I believed what I 
saw. 

This was the scene: 

First, an ordinary old-fashioned 
highway house-trailer of the alu- 
minum kind, only it was obviously 
plated with space steel, an isotope 
alloy of great toughness. A large 
rope, the size of hawser for a major 
oceangoing ship, was hooked to 
one side of the trailer. The rope 
wandered off one side of the trailer 
and threaded its way in a rough 
semi-circle behind. 

Laced to the rope at regular in- 
tervals was the cargo of Julia As- 
sociates, the whole mass of it 
strung like beads on a necklace. 
The circle looped around grace- 
fully and came back to the other 
side of the house-trailer, from 
which, so help me, there shone or- 
dinary lights, giving the effect of 
a homy, comfortable trailer seen 
parked alongside some country 
road at night! 

It wasn’t hard to tell what pow- 
ered Frank’s spaceship. It was a 
breeder-reactor, but a very small 
one. For those who don’t know 
what a B-R is, it’s an atomic power 
plant that produces two phenom- 
ena. 

It produces power by the fa- 
miliar chain reaction of cracking 
U-235, enough power to reach the 
stars. 

But second, and even more im- 



PAYLOAD

portant, some of the neutrons are 
split off to bombard a fuel pack 
of U-238. This U-238 is broken 
down into fissionable U-235, so 
that the device continues to make 
its own future fuel of U-235 while 
consuming its present U-235. In 
other words, with a few ounces of 
U-235 already hot and spitting out 
fission and a few pounds of U-238 
always being converted, you can 
go on forever, tubes blasting. Quan- 
tum, Photon, all the spaceships 
use breeder-reactors, but nobody 
ever built one as small as Frank’s. 
Whatever could you use such a 
small B-R for? 

Thus the tradition-bound brains 
of so-called smart space engineers. 

“I’m coming for you, Spy!” The 
words bounced in my skull and 
I jumped. “I see you! I’m going 
to shoot!” 

I didn’t fall for Frank’s trick. 
I could see him as he slipped out 
of the door of the trailer, a gun 
frozen in his spacesuit mitt, and he 
had hoped that I would start scur- 
rying when he turned up his radio 
power and shouted. 

I was beginning to feel some 
discomfort, and I knew this cat- 
and-mouse routine couldn’t go on 
forever. Then I had a bright idea. 
I snipped four of the mailbags off 
the tow rope and kicked them 
loose in space. My kick had the 
same effect as throwing them over- 
board, for the faster-moving mass 
began to leave them behind. 



T TURNED on my radio sender. 
-*■ “You’ve just lost four mail- 
bags. Uncle Sam won’t like that/ 
Frank, when you show up in Mars 
without the mail.” 

Frank said some nasty things 
and jetted over the acre of boxes 
to see what was going on. The 
light was getting much murkier 
as we moved away from Earth, 
and I figured that it would take 
him a while to find those tiny bags 
—although I suspected that my fu- 
tile kicks hadn’t broken them from 
the mass attraction of our flotilla 
and that they would follow along 
at a respectful distance anyway. 
But he couldn’t know how hard 
I’d shoved or jetted them, and 
he was going crazy, working the 
rim of the necklace and lecturing 
at me. I cut off my receiver and 
clambered my way in haste and 
sweat to the trailer. 

I knew there were, besides 
Frank and his sister Julia, a man 
named William and a woman 
named Mary — Frank had men- 
tioned them in the argument. I 
could only hope they weren’t as 
bloodthirsty as Frank. 

Frank was far back in the mass 
now, and I jetted to the trailer 
door, grabbed the handle and, be- 
cause it wasn’t locked, stumbled in. 

There was a tiny decompression 
chamber, big enough for a single 
body. The outer door slammed 
and the air hissed in automatic 
control. I could see Julia grinning

at me through the glass and I 
made frantic motions for entrance. 
The automatic machinery finished 
its cycle and the inner door opened. 

“Welcome, Mr. Spy, to the main 
office of Julia Associates,” said 
Julia with mock courtesy. 

I took in the room at a glance. 
It was homy, all right. A stove, a 
table and tiny chairs, a space radio, 
a sofa, and by God, bookcases 
lined with books. There was also 
a very large atomic pellet gun 
mounted in the roof bn a uni- 
versal swivel. 

I got off my helmet. “For gosh 
sakes, where is it?” 

Julia held a gun which she kept 
pointed at me. 

“Where’s what?” 

On the sofa sat Mary, a plump, 
gray-haired old lady who could 
have been anybody’s grandmother. 
She was knitting. But, on closer 
look, I saw she had a strong jaw 
and was not as old as her bleached 
hair first made her out to be. 

“In there,” Mary said to me, 
nodding. 

Julia looked puzzled while I 
made a dash for the tiny, closet- 
sized room. Then she laughed as 
I dived into it in agony. 

The bathroom, of course. 

^’P'RANK,” said Julia, “was al- 
ways a brilliant boy, but no- 
body would believe it. In school 
and later, people always thought 
he was lazy because he figured out 



short, simple ways to do things. 
They laughed at him, but they 
usually stole his ideas.” 

I was bolting down a sandwich 
the two women had prepared for 
me, and drinking a celestial glass 
of water from the trailer’s conver- 
sion system. 

“Psychology aside,” I said, “we 
can’t keep up this game of space 
tag forever. I’m likely to get mad 
and twist him into the square root 
of nothing.” 

Julia laughed and stretched her 
long legs and yawned. She had a 
certain sleepy good humor about 
her, like a self-satisfied cat. 

“This I doubt, Mr. — Er,” she 
said. 

“Carl Cummings.” 

“Mr. Cummings. Frank has tried 
hard to get ahead as a space en- 
gineer. But he kept doing things 
the simple way and his superiors 
sneered at him. Now he has his 
own business. But it depends on 
his knowledge of space and his 
design of the miniature breeder- 
reactor. You’re a threat— you could 
steal both.” 

“His breeder-reactor is bolted 
on and space belongs to every- 
body,” I said reasonably. “How 
could I steal anything?” 

“Watch him, Julia,” warned the 
older woman. “He’s prying, like 
Frank said.” 

I was watching Julia’s face. I 
had detected before, back in the 
bar on the space station, that there 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




was bad blood between Frank and 
his sister. Now I saw a faint blush 
spread over the cheeks. The easy, 
humorous eyes widened in anger 
and the lips tightened. 

“For instance, his concept of 
mass versus weight,” she said with 
a defiant glance at Mary. “Mass 
is mass everywhere in the Uni- 
verse, but it equates with weight 
only under gravity. There is none 
in space. Therefore, whether a 
shipment rims a pound or a thou- 
sand tons, weight is no problem. 
A child could shove the Empire 
State Building around very easily 
out here.” 

“Now, Julia—” 

“Everybody knows that,” I said 
quickly. 

“But nobody ever builds a con- 
cept of space travel around it! How 
silly to carry boxes in another 
box called a spaceship when there’s 
no gravity to overcome!” 

“I’m going to get Frank,” said 
Mary, sitting up. 

“You’ll do no such thing,” Julia 
told her. “I’m sick of him always 
being suspicious. I can’t talk to 
anybody, anybody at all! I can’t 
have dates, I can’t call on my 
friends, I can’t walk up the street 
without Frank interfering. Every- 
body’s our enemy! Everybody’s 
a spy! We can’t even get decent 
help—” 

“All right, all right,” said Mary, 
looking resigned. “But Frank is 
going to be awful sore.” 



J ULIA had her victory and in- 
tended to make the most of it 
I could see that, unlike Frank, she 
was a normal, friendly type and 
proud of their achievements, but 
had never had a chance to brag 
about them. And what’s the reason 
in life to do a clever thing unless 
you can take credit for it? 

“You need a good spaceship if 
only to protect the crew,” I said, 
still using probing needles. “That’s 
where Frank’s concept breaks 
down.” 

She fixed me with a triumphant 
eye. “Typical Earth thinking! On 
Earth, there’s weight to overcome, 
weather to protect against, the ef- 
fects of rain, wind and sunshine, 
the drag of friction, the very dan- 
gers of the clouds that hide high 
mountains. Out here— nothing! You 
need a good spacesuit to damp 
out the cosmic rays, control 
temperatures for the body. That’s 
your spaceship! Power? In a 
vacuum like space, you accelerate 
something and it just keeps on 
going forever at that speed. I won’t 
insult your intelligence by point- 
ing out how we can decelerate the 
mass of this shipment by reform- 
ing the rope and blasting against 
our present direction until we over- 
come thrust.” 

“There’re meteors,” I said. 

She tapped me on the chest 
with her finger. She was mak- 
ing a sale now, really warmed up. 
“A spaceship the size of an of- 



PAYLOAD 



89 




fice building offers a great deal 
more target than a man six feet 
tall and a foot and a half wide. 
And space is empty, Mr. Cum- 
mings. That’s what people don't 
understand. Your chances of being 
hit by a meteor are less than the 
chances of being hit by a monkey 
wrench dropped out of an air- 
plane flying over the Earth. At 
least that’s what Frank says. Space 
is truly empty, a concept that 
Earthmen who live in a world clut- 
tered and crammed and joggled up 
full of objects can’t understand." 

“Thanks for telling me the 
things I already knew,” I said drily. 
I was a little annoyed, because I 
was thinking of the cost of the 
Quantum fleet and the ships a- 
building. 

“You know it logically, but you 
don’t know it to feel it,” she said. 
“Frank only grasped it by accident 
one time when he was lost from a 
spaceship and floated around in 
free space for two days.” 

Mary got up. “I’m going to bed, 
Julia. While you’re at it, why don’t 
you also give him the blueprints 
for Frank’s breeder-reactor?” 

Julia smiled sweetly. “Good 
night, Mary. Rest well— we start 
inventory tomorrow.” 

1V/T ARY snorted, put on her space 
helmet, clomped to the door 
and went out. 

Julia laughed at my amazed ex- 
pression. “Of course she sleeps out- 



side! We all do. The moving mass 
carries you along and you simply 
relax and drift. Quiet, safe, alone 
with the stars, drifting free and not 
cooped up in some sardine-bunk. 
It’s a sleep of peace no Earthman 
knows.” 

“Well, thanks for the lecture,” I 
said, “but Frank’s coming along- 
side, I see. Maybe we’d better skip 
the blueprints.” 

Her eyes flashed. “I’m not giving 
out any secrets and Mary knows 
it. But I’m getting sick of this con- 
stant distrust After all, I have 
some say in things. I had to get 
the money to convert this trailer. I 
had to get the backing to design 
and build these spacesuits, to work 
out the details of our qualifying 
shipments, to sell the services of 
Julia Associates to individual ship- 
pers. And I have to go along as 
crew to help with the inventory 
and cook the meals and—” 

She threw up her hands. “Frank 
has been promising to hire help 
for a long time. He never will. He 
trusts nobody. When we organized 
this first Mars trip, I made my- 
self the promise to grab the first 
man that came along— you're him 
—and that’s why I wanted to ex- 
plain things.” 

I looked out of the trailer win- 
dow. It was very dark now, but 
I could see that the spacesuited 
figure was very close, picking his 
way recklessly over our meadow 
of goods.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Maybe I am,” I said, “but we’d 
better not tell Frank just yet. Put 
me to work first” 

“Okay. Take inventory.” 

I’ve been taking inventories 
since I first began to shave. On 
Earth rockets. With Quantum. It 
was obvious that Julia was a good 
saleswoman but a poor detailer. 
The same went for Old William, 
a converted rocketman who spent 
most of his time curled up with 
a book on a comfortable shipping 
box, reading by a flashlight inside 
his space helmet Mary was will- 
ing, but she was a little fat and a 
little old. 

It was necessary for them to 
check out all their items with the 
manifests to be sure that no small 
item was lost, strayed or stolen. 
Quite a job in that jumbled field 
of boxes, containers and packages. 
Julia slipped me some manifests 
and I did more in a half-hour than 
the other three could do in a day. 

Her eyes shone when I turned 
in the sheets, checked out and 
asked for more. 

“I really got carried away,” I 
laughed over the radio. “It’s simple 
for a guy who thinks best staring 
out of his office window, automati- 
cally counting and classifying the 
first hundred helicopters that go 
by. I was bom with a counting 
machine in my head.” 

“And it takes only one bullet 
to unwind it all,” said Frank’s 
voice, jumping out at me. 



W E’D gotten careless. He came 
at me less than a dozen feet 
away, his gun out “That’s all for 
you, spy!” 

I did a shuffle with my feet, but 
nothing happened except the trans- 
fer of my heart from my chest to 
just behind my eyes. 

Julia’s gun was out, too— and 
she pointed it straight at him, 
not me. 

“Wait, Frank!” she said. 

There are certain tones of voice 
that all people have learned to 
respect. It’s the voice of someone 
who has been pushed just a bit 
too far. 

“Listen—” he began. 

“You listen! How many mani- 
fests did you turn over this morn- 
ing as your part of the job?” 

“A couple, I guess. But believe 
me, I had plenty on my mind! 
Now stand aside.” 

“There’ll be no shooting,” she 
said. “You gave me the concept 
for Julia Associates. You built the 
tiny B-R. You trained us for space. 
But I did all the rest. I did, ex- 
cuse the expression, one hell of 
a lot. Now you expect to loaf 
around on this trip while I take 
the inventory, cook meals and 
keep the log. Only it isn’t going to 
be that way. I’ve just hired a man 
to help me— whether you like it or 
not— and that’s the way it’s going 
to be!” 

Frank had heavy-lidded eyes 
and a sleepy face, but there was

nothing wrong with the machinery 
behind it 

“I didn’t tell you this. Last night 
I got on the UHF radio and called 
National Spaceways. Halsey says 
our bird here is Carl Cummings, 
all right and he’s the chief cost 
accountant for Quantum.” 

Julia gave me a startled look. 
Obviously Halsey had found out 
about the mailbag and the liquor 
I’d taken. My veins were strain- 
ing against the spacesuit in fright. 

“Now wait!” I said. “I can ex- 
plain everything—” 

Julia looked coldly at me. It was 
embarrassing for her to have told 
so much to the wrong man, but 
she was practical. 

“He’s still going to take inven- 
tory,” she said to Frank. “You can 
guard him, if you want. By the 
time we get to the Moon and the 
inventory’s taken — you can do 
whatever you want.” 

“I’ll know what to do,” said 
Frank. 

r l^ HEY put me to work on the 
inventory. They fed me, gave 
me water and visiting privileges 
in the trailer, and the rest of the 
time I worked. I have never been 
so careful with an inventory. My 
own staff would’ve sat up in as- 
tonishment I wanted that job to 
last! 

“You can just knock off that 
recount routine,” said Frank as he 
sat a short distance away from me, 



the ever-present gun on his lap. 
“If you try to gum us up by fak- 
ing the inventory, Sis will con- 
sider you expendable. And I'm 
the kid that knows how to ex- 
pend.” 

He meant it Each day, so much 
had to be done, and be done per- 
fectly. Julia would check it all 
while he waited eagerly to find out 
if I’d lost my usefulness to her. 
I made sure I didn’t 

In a dim way, I could even see 
his point of view. Years of hostility 
built up as he drifted from one 
failure to another. The big hos- 
tility against Quantum Associates. 
And then, at last, a victory for a 
man who’d always failed. The con- 
tract stolen from under the nose 
of Quantum. And in the midst of 
that victory, along comes a man 
who could wreck the works— a man 
from his old enemy, Quantum. 

“Of course you can’t hope to 
keep your little secret forever,” I 
told them. 

Julia snorted. “It’ll take a long 
time for your bright engineers to 
make a B-R as small as Frank’s. 
It took him a long time and he’s 
as good as the best.” 

“Listen,” I said. “I could sign 
you up with Quantum. You could 
be vice-president. Frank could be 
a space captain.” 

Frank laughed. 

“Listen,” I said desperately. “I 
could make Frank senior space 
captain of all the Quantum fleet. 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




That’s plenty of publicity, plenty 
of income, not to mention your 
name being a household word. 
Listen—” 

“Why don’t you shut up and get 
some rest? You’ve got a big day 
tomorrow,” said Frank. 

I tried something else ten 
minutes later. 

“Honey,” I said to Mary, “I’ll 
give you a thousand dollars to 
steal Frank’s gun for me. I’ve got 
that much. I’m a Company exec 
with Quantum.” 

Big Mary gave me a scornful 
look. 

“Frank’s mother was my cousin,” 
she said. “She was sick-like. I 
helped raise Frank during the 
times I wasn’t working in one elec- 
tronics factory or another. Now 
Frank is looking after me. What 
he wants goes.” 

Frank came hurrying over the 
top of our space mass. “Hey, you! 
Back to work!” 

W A LIFETIME job,” I told 
Old William. “You name 
the pension figure. I own stock in 
the company. I just want to get 
out with my skin. I won’t hurt 
Frank or his sister.” 

Old William looked up from the 
book he was reading and tried to 
scratch his ear. It looked funny 
because of his space helmet “I like 
this job even better’n night watch- 
man.” His mild brown eyes specu- 
lated on the stars. “I don’t sup- 



pose you’d remember overlong 
once you were out of trouble. And 
there aren’t many people on Earth 
want to hire a lazy bookworm like 
me.” 

I didn’t feel the bullet until 
it struck. Frank had fired it as a 
warning shot but it went right 
through the calf of my leg. Only 
the self-sealing spacesuit saved me, 
and I knew then he really meant 
to kill me. 

The first chance I had, I went 
to the trailer and got Julia to ban- 
dage me up. 

“That brother of yours is out 
for murder,” I said. “You’d better 
cool him down or he’ll spend the 
rest of his life running from the 
law.” 

She straightened up from her 
bandaging job, flushing. “I’ll speak 
to him,” she said. 

She did. It didn’t do any good, 
except to increase the rift between 
them. When I saw that even Julia 
couldn’t save me, I knew it was 
time to put the gray cells to work 
for a final try. 

I had one piece of information 
they didn’t have. I knew that a 
Quantum ship, the Jolly Roger, 
was heading out for the Moon on 
its weekly run. We would be bound 
to cross its path at one time or 
another. 

Frank, with his direct kind of 
mind, paid no attention to space 
navigation. You left Earth; there 
was the Moon visible to the naked

93 





eye. How could you miss it? You 
left the Moon and there was Mars, 
more prominent than it was ever 
seen from Earth, so you headed 
for it— why bother with planetary 
motions and points of intersection 
and all the rest? 

True, you might have to correct 
your line of flight several times 

94 



as you got closer, but you could 
haul food in bulk behind you for 
at least a year and the B-R would 
last much longer. And no shipper 
would hold you for being a couple 
of months overdue— least of all at 
any such price as a hundred dol- 
lars a day. 

They kept a casual watch on 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





the radarscope in the trailer be- 
cause they didn’t want to come 
too close to regular ships, but I 
fixed that I jimmied the controls 
so it swept a portion of space 
where no spaceship would ever be, 
and the dial settings remained the 
same. 

Another time, when I had a few 



seconds alone near the control 
panel of the B-R, I set the controls 
at an angle which would sweep us 
past the Jolly Roger’s track. 

As I finished the inventory for 
one day, I knew that on the next 
we’d cross paths. And none too 
soon, for I had only a few more 
items to tally before my useful-

ness to the Stresingers would be 
done. 

T HEY always drew straws to 
see which one had to stay 
cooped up on watch in the trailer, 
rather than enjoying the restful- 
ness of space. Frank lost that 
night. 

In the middle of the night, I 
knocked for admittance to the 
trailer for a rest-call and Frank, 
digging sleep out of his eyes, 
grudgingly admitted me. 

When I came out of the tiny 
room, I announced, “The bath- 
room is flooding” 

Frank leveled a gun. “Well, get 
a mop,” he grinned at me. 

Frank, the engineer, was a tin- 
kerer, good with his hands, and 
there’s one thing that this sort of 
person can’t stand— to watch some- 
body flubbing the dub when a few 
quick turns with the monkey 
wrench can fix whatever is wrong. 

Frank watched me fool and 
fumble with his plumbing for 
about five minutes before he got 
disgusted and shoved his gun in 
his belt 

“Stand back,” he said, “and don’t 
think you can jump me. I’ve al- 
ready radioed Julia that you’re in 
here, and she’ll blast you the 
minute you set foot outside.” 
“You forget I could jump you 
and then barricade myself in here 
and take the trailer and shipment.” 
Frank had the superior smile of 



the knowing. “Wrong, spy! The 
master controls for the B-R hap- 
pen to be on the outside. I de- 
signed it that way so I wouldn’t 
have to go through decompression 
just to come into the trailer and 
change the line of flight These 
inside controls can be taken over 
by the master panel outside.” 

And he was already digging in- 
to his plumbing setup. 

I didn’t plan to escape. I didn’t 
plan to jump him. I needed only 
five seconds at the other end of 
the trailer with his space radio. I 
called the Jolly Roger, told Cap- 
tain Lake that we were in distress 
and asked him to accelerate on up. 
My message probably sounded a 
bit strange, but Lake, or any of 
our captains, were always on the 
lookout for distress signals. That’s 
the code of the road in space. 

J ULIA Associates were some- 
what astonished when the big 
freighter jumped out of nowhere 
and put out tiny space taxis and 
they found themselves face to face 
with Captain Lake and four armed 
men asking what the trouble was. 
Frank never even had a chance to 
use his atomic pellet gun. 

I waved my hand at the acre 
of goods. ‘We lost our ship, Cap- 
tain. We’ve been traveling with the 
aid of the life-raft to tow the stuff, 
but I don’t think we can make 
the Moon. Can’t you take us over 
as salvage?” 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Salvage!” roared Frank. “Listen, 
you spy—” 

“Salvage!” cried Julia. “How 
dare you—” 

Captain Lake’ eyes glittered. “I 
don’t see any spaceship. I’ve had 
a distress call and one of your crew 
members begs assistance. It looks 
to me like you’re derelict — and 
salvage.” 

Frank was almost purple. “This 
man is not one of our crew! He 
belongs to Quantum Associates 
and this is a foul trick—” 

Lake shrugged. “I don’t know all 
the people who work for Quan- 
tum. Maybe he does, maybe not 
But if he can prove that he’s a 
member of your crew, I’ll have to 
pick you up.” 

“You might take a look at the 
inventory sheets,” I said. “Mak- 
ing ’em up is a crew job and 
every last one of them is in my 
handwriting.” 

HP HE courts had fun with that 
one. Of course we never had a 
chance to get away with the sal- 
vage claim, but the idea of ship- 
ping in space without a spaceship 
rather shocked the Earthmen who 
sat on the jury. After all, they’d 
been reading about spaceships for 
generations and to travel in space, 
why, by God, you need a space- 
ship. 

That set them against Julia As- 
sociates. 

They disallowed the salvage 



claim, but I brought another suit 
for damages, including that shot 
Frank put in my leg. The forced- 
labor and mental-strain claims 
didn’t register, but the shot in the 
leg did. And Frank didn’t help 
his case by yelling on the stand 
that he would’ve aimed higher if 
he’d known. 

At this point, the National 
Spaceloading shipment was still 
impounded on the Moon. When 
I presented my claim for damages, 
it was just too bad for Julia As- 
sociates. They couldn’t pay off. 
And I had a lien on the company 
assets. 

It was fun. 

So was the final day in New 
York when the Chief rubbed his 
hands together and offered me a 
cigar. 

“Well, Carl, you really managed 
this thing well! With Julia Asso- 
ciates as a subsidiary, and with 
their tiny B-R and those special 
spacesuits— nobody will be able to 
touch our space rates! I’m going 
to double your salary.” 

“That’s green-white of you, 
Chief. What about Julia and her 
brother and company?” 

“Oh, we’ll find harmless spots 
for them. When are you going to 
bring that trailer over to the yards 
so we can duplicate the B-R for 
our operation?” 

“Never,” I said amiably. 

The Chief looked at me. 

“The claim that the jury

awarded me and which amounts to 
financial control of the Julia As- 
sociates is not to Quantum, but 
to me personally,” I said. “I’ve de- 
cided to quit Quantum and run my 
own company.” 

“Now wait a minute, Cummings! 
Quantum saved your apples! Cap- 
tain Lake—” 

“Oh, I’ve taken care of that 
I’m hiring Captain Lake. You 
should have his resignation today 
or tomorrow.” 

Then I showed him the new 
sign to hang in front of our offices: 
“Stresinger and Cummings, Space 
Shippers.” 

“I’ll take you to court!” he 
shouted. 

“Do that. I’ll only have to pay 
back the money I drew from 
Quantum while on my trip to the 
Moon. The decision to go on that 
trip was mine, not an order from 
you.” 

“Ill build my own B-R and 
spacesuits and run you out of busi- 
ness!” 

“Please do, Chief,” I said. “All 
you need is a good, small breeder- 
reactor. That should only take you 
about five years to design. Mean- 
while, with ours already in opera- 
tion, we’ll have five years of low- 
cost shipping to build us up to 
your size.” 

“I’ll— I’ll— ” 

“You’ll be working for me, that’s 
what you’ll someday be doing,” I 
said. 



'T'HAT afternoon, I had a session 
with Julia in the new offices 
I had rented. 

“I’m a business woman,” she 
said. “I know when I’m licked. I 
think I could bring myself to work 
for the new company— but there’s 
Frank to think about He won’t 
come in, and it would break his 
heart if I did.” 

I took her by the arm and led 
her to the door. I opened it a crack. 
In the outer office were half a 
dozen people. You only needed a 
glance at the sound-film equip- 
ment they carried to identify them 
as newspapermen. 

“What-” 

“Just watch.” 

The door opened. Frank Stresin- 
ger came in. Julia, from our hid- 
ing place, gasped. Frank looked 
like a movie usher. He wore a 
uniform that had braid, braid and 
braid, silver on black. He looked 
real good in it. But his face was 
scowling. 

“How the devil did he get 
that—” 

“Oh, you sent it to him,” I said. 
“You told him you had a plan to 
stop me from controlling the com- 
pany and for him to wear the uni- 
form and come on up here. I had 
the office boy deliver it after you 
left him at your apartment, of 
course.” 

“But-” 

“Listen to them!” 

Newspapermen are busy people.

They were already at work, firing 
the questions at Frank. As the cap- 
tain of our fleet, what were his 
predictions for the new company? 
Would this smash the old-line com- 
panies? Was he hiring space peo- 
ple from the other companies? 
What— 

And so on. 

The man who had never had 
status stood there in the shining, 
glittering uniform and sputtered. 
Two or three of the newsmen were 
famous people. The names on the 
equipment were great names in 
network communications. They 
were coming to him, asking him 
questions— 

“He’ll knock them down,” 
breathed Julia. 

“He’ll do nothing of the kind,” 
I said. 

TIE did nothing of the kind. 
■*-*- Within five minutes, he was 
strutting before the cameras, tell- 
ing off the world. He was making 
good copy and they were lapping 
it up, and I closed the door. 

“Now will you sign?” I asked. 

“How much of the company do 
Frank and I get?” 

“A quarter apiece. I get the 
other half.” 

“Both Photons and Space Sav- 
ers will make that good a deal and 
lend me money to pay off your 
lien.” 

It was time to pull the final 
gambit. I laid the contract on the 



desk. “In this state,” I said, “a wife 
owns half of everything a husband 
does. Both the heads of Photons 
and Space Savers are married. 
I’m not” 

Julia looked shocked. Then she 
looked outraged. Both ways, she 
looked cute. 

“God, what nerve!” 

“Why don’t you struggle with 
the thought a few days?” I said. 

Outside, we could hear Frank’s 
voice, finishing the interview. All 
her life she’d been taking care of 
Frank, keeping a place for him, 
trying to sell his inventions, trying 
to give him stability. She was in 
her thirties, unmarried and proba- 
bly sick of her narrow life. All my 
life I’d been struggling to get some 
place. Alone. I was sick of that, 
too. 

“No, thanks,” she said, deciding 
not to make an issue of it, but 
giving me an affectionate pat on 
the cheek. 

Frank burst into the office. He 
stopped when he saw us. 

“Well, I see you hooked him!” 
he crowed, seeing her cheek-pat 
“Community property keeps it all 
in the family like you said, Julia- 
even if I hate the guy. Did he put 
up much fight?” 

Julia blushed the deepest red 
I ever saw anyone blush. 

“Not m-much,” she said. 

I guess she had a plan, after 
all.

THE ASCENT OF RUM 
DOODLE by W. E. Bowman. The 
Vanguard Press, N. Y. $2.95 

T? VEN if you have nothing more 
than the adventuresome spirit 
of a social climber, you’ll find 
in Rum Doodle oodles of vicarious 
information concerning the how-to 
of conquering that titanic peak. 
To be truthful, I had never heard 
of Rum Doodle and its companion 
peak, North Doodle, which lies to 
the west. 

Estimates of its height vary be- 
tween 30,000 and 50,000 feet But 
taking the average, the height 



works out to 40,000%. Obviously, 
all previous accounts of successful 
and unsuccessful ascents of other 
peaks pale into insignificance 
alongside this epic. 

The expedition consisted of 
seven picked men and its object 
was to place two men on the sum- 
mit requiring the establishment of 
a camp at 39,000 feet. Equipment 
for this camp called for five por- 
ters. Two porters were needed to 
carry food for these five, and an- 
other carried food for these two. 
His food was carried by a boy. 
Altogether, for the various bases 
and camps established up the 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mountain, 3,000 porters and 375 
boys were needed. As you can see, 
it was a remarkably well-organ- 
ized assault. 

The descriptive passages are as 
breathtakingly awesome as in any 
book on mountaineering you may 
have devoured. 

Just take this example: “The 
North Wall is a sheer glass-like 
face of ice broken only by rock, 
snowfields, ice-pinnacles, crevasses, 
bergschrunds, ridges, gulleys, scree, 
gendarmes, Dames Anglaises, 
needles, strata, gneiss and gab- 
bra.” 

In actuality, the major credit 
for the incredible climb can be 
given the native cook, Pong. If not 
for him, the summit would never 
have been attained. But all in 
vain— from his cooking there was 
no escape. 

If this misAdventure book 
doesn’t make you forget your 
cares, see your doctor at once! 
It’s laughter than you think!

Of these six yarns, half present

“The Midas Plague” depicts a

material possessions and our con- 
cepts of rich and poor are topsy- 
turvied. “The Census Takers” and

T IKE R. E. Howard, Lovecraft 
seemingly goes on forever; the 
two decades since their death are 
as nothing. In any event, they 
appear more prolific now than 
then. What with de Camp, Nyberg 
and Derleth avidly rooting out 
every scrap of their writings and 
expanding them into novels, there 
may never be an end to their 
posthumous careers. 

Whether this is a good thing is 
a moot point. Lovecraft at his best 
could build a mood of horror un- 
surpassed; at his worst, he was 
laughable. Taking Lovecraft* s frag- 
mentary plot notes, Derleth gener- 
ates unintended humor in most of 
his reconstructions. The excep- 
tions are the two final entries, “The 
Shadow out of Space” and “The 
Lamp of Alhazred.” 

Having read Lovecraffs novel, 
The Shadow out of Time, in Asf 



some twenty-one years ago and be- 
ing no master of total recall, it 
appears to me to bear considerable 
resemblance to the Derleth refab. 
But, that aside, A. D. has done a 
commendable job with this one

The final story, “The Lamp of

TJERHAPS the most endearing 
feature of Frederic Brown’s 
art is his Puckish humor. I almost 
said Roguish but that would mere- 
ly point up redundantly the fail- 
ure of this novel. To summarize— 

Crag, the pivotal character, is 
an unregenerate criminal who is 
framed for reasons and by persons 
unknown. The presiding judge at 
his trial was also his arbiter six 
years previously, when he went 
free though guilty, to the enraged 
disgust of the judge. Since then. 
Judge Olliver has risen very high 
in party circles, having been beaten 
out for American Coordinator, but 
polling a huge vote. 

Crag discovers the reason for 
Quiver’s interest in his case after 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




his conviction. During the usual 
closeting prior to sentencing, Ol- 
liver confides that he wants Crag 
to escape so that he can do a per- 
sonal job for him. He offers Crag 
limited assistance, but a whopping 
million credits if he can steal a 
certain article. Crag is slated for 
the psycher, a sort of plastic sur- 
gery job on the ego, that will turn 
him into more palatable charac- 
ter. Conveniently, though, Olli- 
ver’s wife, an edible redhead, is a 
psycher technician, so that takes 
care of that. 

Olliver, by the way, is in ca- 
hoots with Crag because he wants 
to reestablish Democracy, now a 
naughty word, and the mysterious 
article that Crag is to steal will 
help him do it. 

Oops. Almost forgot. Crag has 
a removable prosthetic right hand, 
weight 10 lbs., that enables him 
to throw (literally) a terrific right- 
hand punch. 

But all this is pretty small po- 
tatoes because Brown has some- 
thing really big in store. A sentient 
asteroid has blundered into the 
Solar System and has taken a shine 



to this miserable criminal. It 
brings him back to life— it really 
shouldn’t have bothered!— and, in 
general, acts moonstruck, if you’ll 
pardon the expression. 

All this might have been fine 
had Brown realized he was writ- 
ing a funny story and treated it 
that way. He didn’t.

Being a scrupulous root estate agent and a 
devout angler, Homer Jackson knew a clean 
sale from a fish story — but not this tlmel 



T HE man who came into 
Homer Jackson’s office 
was wearing his left shoe 
on his right foot and his right 
shoe on his left. 

He gave Homer quite a start 

CARBON COPY 



The man was tall and had a 
gangling look about him, but he 
was smartly dressed— except for 
his shoes. And his shoes were all 
right too; it was just the way 
he wore them. 

105 




“Am I addressing Mr. Homer 
Jackson?” he asked with a for- 
mality to which Homer was en- 
tirely unaccustomed. 

“That’s me,” said Homer. 

He squirmed a bit uncomfort- 
ably in his chair. He hoped this 
wasn’t one of Gabby Wilson’s 
jokes. 

Gabby had an office just 
down the hall and loved to pes- 
ter Homer plenty. When Gabby 
cooked up a joke, he did a mas- 
sive job on it; he left out not a 
single detail. And some of Gab- 
by’s jokes got pretty rough. 

But the man seemed to be 
dead serious and perhaps a little 
anxious. 

“Mr. Homer Jackson, the sub- 
urban realtor?” he persisted. 

“That’s right,” said Homer. 

“Specializing in lake proper- 
ties and country acreages?” 

Tm your man.” Homer began 
to feel uncomfortable. This man 
was spreading it on a trifle thick 
and Homer thought he could see 
Gabby’s hand in it. 

“I’d like to talk with you. I have 
a matter of small business.” 

“Fire away,” said Homer, mo- 
tioning toward a chair. 

The man sat down carefully, 
bolt upright in the chair. 

“My name is Oscar Steen,” he 
said. “We’re building a develop- 
ment on what is known as the 
Saunders place. We call it Hap- 
py Acres.” 

106 



TTOMER nodded. “I’m ac- 
quainted with the place. 
It’s the last good holding on the 
lake. You were fortunate to get 
it.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Jackson. We 
think that it is nice.” 

“How are you getting on?” 
“We have just finished it. But 
now comes the most important 
part. We must get people onto 
the property.” 

“Well,” said Homer, “things 
are a little tough right now. 
Money has tightened up and the 
interest rates are higher and 
Washington is no help and be- 
sides that—” 

“We wondered if you’d be in- 
terested in handling it for us.” 
Homer choked a little, but re- 
covered quickly. “Well, now, I 
don’t know. Those houses may 
be hard to sell. You’d have to get 
a solid figure for them and the 
prices will run high. That stone 
wall you put around the place and 
those fancy gates and all, I would 
suspect you have high-class 
houses. You have gone and made 
it into an exclusive section. 
There’ll be only a certain class of 
buyer who might be interested.” 
“Mr. Jackson,” said Steen, “we 
have a new approach. You won’t 
have to sell them. We’re only 
leasing them.” 

“Renting them, you mean.” 
“No, sir, leasing them.” 

“Well, it all comes out to the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




same thing in the end. You’ll 
have to get a lot for them” 

“Five thousand.” 

“Five thousand is an awful lot 
of money. At least, out here it 
is. Five thousand a year comes 
to over four hundred a month 
and—” 

“Not for a year,” corrected 
Steen. “For ninety-nine.” 

“For what!” 

“Ninety-nine. We’re leasing at 
five thousand dollars for nine- 
ty-nine full years ” 

“But, man, you can’t do that! 
Why, that’s absolutely crazy! 
Taxes would eat up—” 

“We’re not so interested in 
making money on the houses as 
we are in creating business for 
our shopping center.” 

“You mean you have a shop- 
ping center in there, too?” 

Steen allowed himself a smile. 
“Mr. Jackson, we obtain the 
property and then we build the 
wall to have some privacy so 
there can be no snoopers.” 

“Yes, I know,” said Homer. “It’s 
smart to do it that way. Good 
publicity. Whets the public’s in- 
terest. Gives you a chance to 
have a big unveiling. But that 
twelve-foot wall—” 

“Fourteen, Mr. Jackson.” 

“All right, then, fourteen. And 
it’s built of solid stone. I know— 
I watched them put it up. And no 
one builds walls of solid stone 
any more. They just use stone 



facing. The way you built that 
wall set you back a hunk—” 

“Mr. Jackson, please. We know 
what we are doing. In this shop- 
ping center, we sell everything 
from peanuts to Cadillacs. But 
we need customers. So we build 
houses for our customers. We de- 
sire to create a good stable popu- 
lation of rather well-to-do fami- 
lies.” 

J UMPING to his feet in exas- 
peration, Homer paced up 
and down the office. 

“But, Mr. Steen, you can’t pos- 
sibly build up enough business at 
your shopping center by relying 
solely on the people in your de- 
velopment. For instance, how 
many houses have you?” 

“Fifty.” 

“Fifty families are a mere 
drop in the bucket for a shop- 
ping center. Even if every one 
of those fifty families bought all 
their needs from you— and you 
can’t be sure they will— but if 
they did, you’d still have little 
volume. And you won’t pick up 
any outside trade — not behind 
that wall, you won’t.” 

He stopped his pacing and 
went back to his chair. 

“I don’t know why I’m upset 
about it,” he told Steen. “It’s no 
skin off my nose. Yes, I’ll handle 
the development, but I can’t 
handle leasing at my usual five 
per cent.”

“Oh, I forgot to tell you,” said 
Steen. “You keep the entire five 
thousand” 

Homer gasped like a fish 
hauled suddenly from water. 

“On one condition,” added 
Steen. “One has to be so care- 
ful. We have a bank, you see. 
Part of the shopping center 
service.” 

“A bank,” Homer said feebly. 
“Chartered under the state 
banking regulations.” 

“And what has a bank to do 
with me? 

“You’ll take ten per cent,” said 
Steen. “The rest will be credited 
to your account in the Happy 
Acres Bank. Every time you 
lease a unit, you get five hundred 
cash; forty-five hundred goes 
into your bank account.” 

“I don’t quite see—” 

“There are advantages.” 

“Yes, I know,” Homer said. “It 
builds up your business. You’re 
out to make that shopping cen- 
ter go.” 

“That might be one factor. An- 
other is that we can’t have you 
getting rich in front of all your 
friends and neighbors. There’d 
be too much talk about it and 
we don’t want that kind of pub- 
licity. And there are tax advan- 
tages as well.” 

“Tax advantages?” 

“Mr. Jackson, if you lease all 
fifty houses, you will have earned 
a quarter million dollars. Have 



you ever figured what the income 
tax might be on a quarter mil- 
lion dollars?” 

“It would be quite a lot.” 

“It would be a crying shame,” 
said Steen. “The bank could be a 
help.” 

“I don’t quite see how.” 

“You leave that to us. Leave 
everything to us. You just lease 
the houses.” 

“Mr. Steen, I’ve been an 
honest man for years in an oc- 
cupation where there’s opportu- 
nity—” 

“Honesty, Mr. Jackson. Of 
course we know you’re honest 
That’s why we came to you. 
Have you got your car here?” 
“It’s parked outside.” 

“Fine. Mine is at the station 
getting serviced. Let’s drive out 
and look the houses over.” 

II 

T HE houses were all that any- 
one could wish. They were 
planned with practical imagina- 
tion and built with loving care. 
There was, Homer admitted to 
himself, more honest workman- 
ship in them than he had seen 
for many years in this era of 
mass-production building. They 
had that quiet sense of quality 
material, of prideful craftsman- 
ship, of solidity, of dignity and 
tradition that was seldom found 
any more.

They were well located, all fif- 
ty of them, in the wooded hills 
that stretched back from the 
lake, and the contractor had not 
indulged in the ruthless slashing 
out of trees. Set in natural sur- 
roundings, with decent amounts 
of space around them, they stood, 
each one of them, in compara- 
tive privacy. 

In the spring, there would be 
wild flowers, and in the autumn, 
the woods would flame with color 
and there would be birds and 
squirrels and rabbits. And there 
was a stretch of white sand 
beach, the last left on the whole 
lake. 

Homer began mentally to 
write the ad he’d put in the Sun- 
day paper and found that he 
looked forward with some antic- 
ipation to setting down the 
words. This was one he could 
pull out all the stops on, use all 
the purple prose he wanted. 

“I like it, Mr. Steen,” he said. 
“I think they won’t be too hard 
to move ” 

“That is good,” Steen replied. 
“We are prepared to give you 
an exclusive contract for a period 
of ten years. Renewable, of 
course.” 

“But why ten years? I can get 
this tract handled in a year or 
two, if it goes at all.” 

“You are mistaken. The busi- 
ness, I can assure you, will be 
continuing.” 



They stood on the brick walk 
in front of one of the houses and 
looked toward the lake. There 
were two white sails on the 
water, far toward the other shore, 
and a rowboat bobbed in the 
middle distance, with the black 
smudge of a hunched fisherman 
squatted in the stern. 

Homer shook his head in some 
bewilderment. “I don’t under- 
stand.” 

“There’ll be some subletting,” 
Steen told him smobthly. ‘When 
fifty families are involved, there 
are always some who move.” 

“But that’s another story. Sub- 
letting—” 

Steen pulled a paper from his 
pocket and handed it to Homer. 
“Your contract. You’ll want to 
look it over. Look it over close- 
ly. You’re a cautious man and 
that’s the kind of man we want.” 

TT OMER drove along the 
winding, wooded road back 
to the shopping center with 
Steen. 

The center was a lovely place. 
It stretched along the entire 
south side of the property, 
backed by the fourteen-foot wall, 
and was a shining place of brand- 
new paint and gleaming glass and 
metal. 

Homer stopped the car to look 
at it. 

“You’ve got everything,” he 
said.

“I think we have,” said Steen 
proudly. “We’ve even got our own 
telephone exchange.” 

“Isn’t that unusual?” 

“Not at all. What we have set 
up here amounts to a model vil- 
lage, a model living space. We 
have our own water system and 
our sewage plant Why not a 
telephone exchange?” 

Homer let it pass. There was 
no sense arguing. It all was just 
this side of crazy, anyhow. No 
matter how fouled up it was, 
Steen seemed satisfied. 

Maybe, Homer told himself, 
he knows what he is doing. 

But Homer doubted it 
“One thing more,” said Steen. 
“It is just a minor matter, but 
you should know about it. We 
have a car agency, you see. Many 
agencies, in fact We can supply 
almost any make of car—” 

“But how did you do—” 

“We know our way around. 
Any make of car a person would 
want And anyone who leases 
must buy a car from us.” 

“Mister,” Homer said, “I’ve 
heard a lot of fast ones in the 
auto business, but this one beats 
them all. If you think Til sell 
cars for you—” 

“There’s nothing wrong with 
it,” said Steen. “We have some 
good connections. Any car one 
wants at a fair and honest price. 
And we are prepared to give 
good value on their trade-ins, too. 



It would never do to have old 
rattletraps in a high-class devel- 
opment like this.” 

“And what else? I think you 
better tell me how many other 
tie-in deals you have.” 

“Not a single one. The auto- 
mobile is all.” 

Homer put the car in gear and 
drove slowly . toward the gate. 

The uniformed gateman saw 
them coming and swung the gates 
wide open. He waved to them 
cheerily as they went past his 
kiosk. 

in 

WOULDN’T touch it with 
a ten-foot pole,” Homer 
told his wife, Elaine, “if there 
weren’t so much money in it But 
things have been kind of slow 
with this higher interest rate and 
all and this deal would give me 
a chance—” 

“If it’s Mr. Steen wearing his 
shoes on the wrong feet” Elaine 
said, “I don’t think you need to 
worry. You remember Uncle 
Eb?” 

“Sure. He was the one who 
wore his vest inside out” 

“Pure stubbornness, that’s 
what it was with Uncle Eb. He 
put it on inside out one day and 
someone laughed at him. So 
Uncle Eb said that was the way 
to wear a vest. And that’s the 
way he wore it to his dying day”

“Well, sure,” said Homer, “that 
might be it, of course. But wear- 
ing a vest inside out wouldn’t 
hurt your chest. Shoes on the 
wrong feet would hurt something 
terrible.” 

“This poor Mr. Steen might 
be a cripple of some sort May- 
be he was born that way.” 

“I never heard of anyone bom 
with his right and left foot 
switched.” 

“It’s queer, naturally,” Elaine 
persisted, “but what difference 
does it make? If you lease all 
those houses, we can go to 
Europe like we’ve always 
planned. As far as I’m concerned, 
he can go barefoot if he wants.” 

“Yeah, I suppose so.” 

“And we need a car,” Elaine 
said, beginning on her catalogue. 
“And drapes for the living room. 
And I haven’t had a new dress 
in ages. And it’s shameful to be 
using our old silver. We should 
have replaced it years ago. It’s 
the old stuff Ethel gave us when 
we were married—” 

“All right,” said Homer. “If I 
lease the houses, if the deal holds 
up, if I don’t get in jail— we’ll 
go to Europe.” 

He knew when he was licked. 

He read the contract carefully. 
It was all right. It said, in black 
and white, that he got the whole 
five thousand. 

Maybe, he told himself, he 
should have a lawyer see it. A1 



Congdon could tell him in a 
minute if it was ironclad. But he 
shrank from showing it There 
seemed something sinful, almost 
shameful, about his getting all 
that money. 

He checked on the Happy 
Acres Bank. A charter had been 
issued and all regulations had 
been met. 

He checked on building per- 
mits and they were in order, too. 
So what was a man to do? 
Especially when he had a wife 
who had yearned loudly for ten 
years to go to Europe. 

Homer sat down and wrote an 
ad for the real estate section of 
the Sunday paper. On second 
thought, he dismissed the purple 
prose that he had planned to 
use. He employed the low-key 
technique. The ad wasn’t long. 
It didn’t cost too much. It read: 

$4.16!!!!! 

WOULD YOU PAY ONLY $4.16 

a month to live in a house 
that would sell for $35,000 
to $50,000?

morning. He was belligerent. He 
slammed the folded want ad sec- 
tion down on Homer’s desk. He 
had ringed Homer’s ad with a 
big red-pencil mark. 

“This isn’t true!” yelled Mor- 
gan. “What kind of come-on is 
this?” 

“It’s substantially true,” Homer 
answered quietly. “That’s what 
it figures out to.” 

“You mean I just pay $4.16 a 
month?” 

Well,” hedged Homer, “it’s not 
quite as simple as all that. You 
lease it for ninety-nine years.” 

‘What would I want with a 
house for ninety-nine years? I 
won’t live that long.” 

“Actually, if s better than owit- 
ing a house. You can live there 
a lifetime, just as if you owned 
the place, and there are no taxes 
and no maintenance. And if you 
have children, they can go on 
living there.” 

“You mean this is on the 
level?” 

Homer emphatically nodded. 
“Absolutely.” 

“Whaf s wrong with this house 
of yours?” 

“There’s nothing wrong with 
it. Ifs a new house among other 
new houses in an exclusive neigh- 
borhood. You have a shopping 
center just up the road thafs as 
good as any city—” 

“You say ifs new?” 

“Right There are fifty houses. 



You can pick out the one you 
want. But I wouldn’t take too 
long to decide, because these will 
go like hot cakes.” 

“I got my car outside.” 

“All right” said Homer, reach- 
ing for his hat. “I'll take my car 
and show you the way. The 
houses are unlocked. Look at 
them and choose the one you 
want” 

Out on the street Homer got 
into his car and sat down on 
something angular. He cursed be- 
cause it hurt He lifted himself 
and reached down and picked 
up the thing he’d sat on. 

It was nothing he had ever 
seen before and he tossed it to 
the other side of the seat It was, 
he thought something like one 
of those clip-together plastic 
blocks that were made for chil- 
dren, but how it had gotten in 
his car, he could not imagine. 

TIE wheeled out into the street 
and signalled for the Mor- 
gan car to follow. 

There were Mrs. Morgan and 
Jack, a hell-raising eight-year- 
old, and Judy, a winsome five- 
year-old, and Butch, the Boxer 
pup. All of them, Homer saw, 
were taken by surprise at the 
sight of Happy Acres. He could 
tell by the way Mrs. Morgan 
clasped her hands together and 
by the way suspicion darkened 
Morgan’s face. One could almost

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




hear him thinking that no one 
was crazy enough to offer a deal 
like this. 

Jack and Butch, the pup, went 
running in the woods and Judy 
danced gaily on the lawn and, 
Homer told himself, he had them 
neatly hooked. 

Homer spent a busy day. His 
phone was jammed with calls. 
House-hunting families, suspi- 
cious, half-derisive, descended on 
the office. 

He did the best he could. He’d 
never had a crowd like this be- 
fore. 

He directed the house-hunting 
families out to Happy Acres. He 
patiently explained to callers that 
it was no hoax, that there were 
houses to be had. He urged all 
of them to hurry and make up 
their minds. 

“They won’t last long,” he 
told them, intoning unctuously 
that most ancient of all real es- 
tate selling gimmicks. 

After church, Elaine came 
down to the office to help him 
with the phone while he talked 
to the prospects who dropped in. 

Late in the afternoon, he drove 
out to Happy Acres. The place 
was an utter madhouse. It looked 
like a homecoming or a state fair 
or a monster picnic. People 
were wandering around, walking 
through the houses. One had 
three windows broken. The floors 
were all tracked up. Water fau- 



cets had been left running. Some- 
one had turned on a hose and 
washed out a flowerbed. 

He tried to talk with some 
of them, but he made no head- 
way. He went back to the office 
and waited for the rush to start. 
There wasn’t any rush. 

A few phone calls came in and 
he assured the callers it was on 
the level. But they were still hard 
to convince. 

He went home beat. 

He hadn’t leased a house. 

V 

lVT ORGAN was the first one 
who came back. He came 
back alone, early Monday morn- 
ing. He was still suspicious. 

“Look,” he said, “I’m an archi- 
tect. I know what houses cost. 
What’s the catch?” 

“The catch is that you pay 
five thousand cash for a ninety- 
nine-year lease.” 

“But that’s no catch. That’s 
like buying it. The normal house, 
when it stands a hundred years, 
has long since lost its value.” 
“There’s another catch,” said 
Homer. “The builder won’t lease 
to you unless you buy a new 
car from him.” 

“That’s illegal!” shouted Mor- 
gan. 

“I wouldn’t know. Nobody’s 
forcing you to take the offer.” 
“Let’s forget about the car for 



padrcim rnpv

the moment,” Morgan urged. 
“What I want to know is, how 
can the builder put up a place 
like that for five thousand dol- 
lars? I know for a fact that he 
can’t” 

“So do I. But if he wants to 
lose a lot of money, who are we 
to stop him?” 

Morgan pounded on the desk. 
“What’s the gimmick, Jackson?” 

“The builder wears his shoes 
on the wrong feet, if that means 
anything to you.” 

Morgan stared at him. “I 
think you’re crazy, too. What 
would that have to do with it?” 

“I don’t know,” said Homer. 
“I just mentioned it, thinking it 
might help you.” 

“Well, it doesn’t.” 

Homer sighed. “It’s got me puz- 
zled, too” 

Morgan picked up his hat and 
jammed it on his head. “I’ll be 
seeing you,” he said. It sounded 
like a threat 

“I’ll be right here,” said Homer 
as Morgan went slamming out 
the door. 

Homer went down to the drug- 
store for a cup of coffee. 

When he got back, a second 
visitor was waiting for him. The 
man sat stiffly in a chair and 
tapped nervous fingers on his 
briefcase, held primly in his lap. 
He looked as if he’d eaten some- 
thing sour. 

“Mr. Jackson,” he said, “I rep- 



resent the County Realtors Asso- 
ciation.” 

“Not interested,” said Homer. 
“I’ve gotten along for years with- 
out joining that outfit I can get 
along a few years more.” 

“I’m not here to solicit mem- 
bership. I am here about that ad 
of yours in the paper yesterday.” 

“Good ad, I thought It 
brought in a lot of business.” 

“It’s exactly the kind of adver- 
tising that our association frowns 
upon. It is, if you will pardon 
the expression, nothing but a 
come-on.” 

“Mr.— by the way, what is your 
name?” 

“Snyder,” said the man. 

“Mr. Snyder, if you happen to 
be in the market for a place out 
in this area at the ridiculously 
low cost of $4.16 a month, I shall 
be glad to show you any one of 
fifty houses. If you have a mo- 
ment, I can drive you out.” 

HP HE man’s mouth snapped to- 
•*- gether like a trap. “You know 
what I mean, Jackson. This is 
fraudulent advertising and you 
know it is. It is misrepresenta- 
tion. We mean to show it is.” 

Homer pitched his hat on top 
of the filing cabinet and sat down 
in his chair. 

“Snyder,” he said, “you’re clut- 
tering up the place. You’ve done 
your duty— you’ve warned me. 
Now get out of here.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




It wasn’t exactly what he had 
meant to say and he was sur- 
prised at himself for saying it. 
But now that it was said, there 
was no way of recalling it and 
he rather liked the feel of 
strength and independence that 
it gave him. 

“There is no use flying off the 
handle,” said Snyder. “We could 
talk this over.” 

“You came in and made your 
threat,” Homer retorted. “There’s 
nothing to talk over. You said 
you were going to get me, so 
come ahead and get me.” 

Snyder got to his feet 
savagely. “You’ll regret this, 
Jackson.” 

“Maybe so,” admitted Homer. 
“Sure you don’t need a house?” 

“Not from you,” said Snyder, 
and went stalking out. 

Must have hurt their weekend 
sales, Homer told himself, watch- 
ing Snyder go stumping down 
the street 

He sat quietly, thinking. He’d 
known there would be trouble, 
but there had been no way he 
could have passed up the deal. 
Not with Elaine set on that trip 
to Europe. 

And now he was committed. 
He could not back out even if 
he wished. And he wasn’t sure 
that he wanted to. There could be 
a lot of money in it. 

The car deal he didn’t like, 
but there was nothing he could 



do about it. And by handling it 
right, he might keep in the clear. 
Maybe, he thought, he should go 
out and talk to Steen about it. 

Gabby Wilson, his insurance- 
selling neighbor down the hall, 
came in and flopped into a chair. 
Gabby was a loud-mouth. 

“Howsa boy?” he yelled. “Hear 
you got that Happy Acres deal. 
How’s about cutting in your old 
pal on the insurance end?” 

“Go chase yourself,” invited 
Homer irritably. 

“Heard a good story the other 
day. It seems this wrecking out- 
fit got a job to tear down a build- 
ing. And the straw boss got his 
orders wrong and tore down an- 
other building.” Gabby slapped 
his knee and roared with laugh- 
ter. “Can you imagine the look 
on that contractor’s face when 
he heard the news?” 

“It cost him a lot of money,” 
Homer said. “He had a right to 
be good and sore.” 

“You don’t think it’s funny?” 
“No, I don’t.” 

“How you getting on with this 
Happy Acres gang?” 

“Fine, so far,” said Homer. 
“Cheap outfit,” Gabby told 
him. “I been checking round. 
They got some two-bit contractor 
from out in the sticks somewhere 
to do the job for them. Didn’t 
even buy their material from the 
dealers here. The contractor 
brought his own crew with him.

The developers didn’t spend a 
nickel locally” 

“Unpatriotic of them.” 

“Not smart, either. Houses 
probably will fall down in a year 
or two.” 

“I don’t care particularly. Just 
so I get them leased.” 

“Do anything so far?” 

“Got some interest in them. 
Here comes a prospect now.” 

It was Morgan. He had parked 
in front and was getting out of a 
new and shiny car, agleam with 
chrome. 

Gabby beat a swift retreat. 
Morgan came into the office. 
He sat down in a chair and pulled 
out his checkbook. 

“I bought the car,” he said. 
“How do you want this check 
made out?” 

VI 

CIX weeks later, Homer 
^ dropped in at the shopping 
center office. Steen was sitting 
with his feet up on the desk. He 
was wearing black shoes instead 
of the brown ones he had worn 
before. They still were on the 
wrong feet. 

“Howdy, Mr. Jackson,” he said 
easily. 

Homer sat down in a chair. 
“I finally got rid of them. All the 
fifty houses are leased.” 

“That’s fine.” Steen reached 
into a drawer, took out a small 



book and tossed it across the 
desk to Homer. “Here. This be- 
longs to you.” 

Homer picked it up. It was a 
bank book. He opened it and 
saw a neat row of $4,500 entries 
marching down the page. 

“You made yourself a mint,” 
said Steen. 

“I wish I had fifty more,” 
Homer told him. “Or two hun- 
dred more. This thing is catch- 
ing on. I could lease them in a 
week. I’ve got a waiting list 
longer than my arm.” 

“Well, why don’t you go ahead 
and lease them?” 

“I can’t lease them a second 
time.” 

“Funny thing,” said Steen. 
“There’s no one living in those 
houses. They all are standing 
empty.” 

“But that can’t be!” objected 
Homer. “There might be a few 
still empty— a few that the peo- 
ple haven’t occupied yet. But 
most of them have moved in. 
They’re living in those houses.” 

“That’s not the way it looks 
to me.” 

“What’s happened to those 
people then? Where have they—” 

“Mr. Jackson!” 

“Yes?” 

“You haven’t trusted me. You 
didn’t trust me from the start I 
don’t know why. You thought 
the deal was queer. You were 
scared of it. But I’ve played 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




fair with you. You’ll have to ad- 
mit I have.” 

Homer stroked the bank book. 
“More than fair.” 

“I know what I am doing, Mr. 
Jackson. I’m not anybody’s fool. 
I have the angles figured out. 
String along with me. I need a 
man like you.” 

“You mean lease all those 
houses a second time!” Homer 
asked uneasily. 

CC A SECOND time,” said 
Steen. “And a third. And 
fourth. Lease them as often as 
you like. Keep right on leasing 
them. No one will mind at all.” 
“But the people will mind— 
the people that I lease those 
houses to,” Homer pointed out. 

“Mr. Jackson, let me handle 
this. Don’t you worry about a 
solitary thing. You just keep 
those houses moving.” 

“But it isn’t right.” 

“Mr. Jackson, in some six 
weeks’ time, you’ve made a quar- 
ter million dollars. I suppose 
that’s what’s wrong with you. 
I suppose you figure that’s 
enough—” 

“Well, no. With income tax 
and all—” 

“Forget the income tax. I told 
you that this bank of ours had 
tax advantages.” 

“I don’t get it,” Homer said. 
“This is no way to do business.” 
“But it is,” said Steen. “I chal- 



lenge you to find a better way 
to do business. There’s no end to 
it. You can become a multi-mil- 
lionaire—” 

“In jail.” 

“I’ve told you we weren’t do- 
ing wrong. If you don’t want to 
handle it—” 

“Let me think it over,” Homer 
pleaded. “Give me a day or two.” 

“Noon tomorrow,” said Steen 
decisively. “If you don’t tell me 
you are willing to go ahead by 
noon tomorrow, I’ll look for some- 
one else.” 

Homer got up. He thrust the 
bank book in his pocket. “I’ll be 
in to see you.” 

Steen put his feet back on the 
desk. “Fine. I’ll be expecting 
you.” 

Out on the concourse, Homer 
walked along the gleaming shop 
fronts. And the shops, he saw, 
were no more than half-staffed 
and entirely innocent of buyers. 
He went into a drugstore to buy 
a cigar and was waited on by a 
girl of just slightly more than 
high school age. He failed to 
recognize her. 

“You live around here?” he 
asked. 

“No, sir. In the city.” 

He went into a hardware store 
and into a grocery supermarket. 
He saw no one he knew. And 
that was queer. He’d lived in the 
area for almost thirteen years and 
thought he knew everyone.

He recalled what Gabby had 
said about the contractor from 
somewhere out of town. Maybe, 
for some zany reason, Steen had 
a policy against employing local 
people. Still, he’d employed 
Homer. 

¥ T was a crazy setup, Homer 
■*- told himself. None of it made 
sense— and least of all, the leas- 
ing of the houses a second time 
around. 

Perhaps he should get out of 
it. He’d made a fair amount of 
money. Right now, most likely, 
he could get out slick and clean. 
If he stayed, there might be 
trouble. 

He lighted up the cigar and 
went back to his car. Wheeling 
out of the parking lot, he headed 
for the road that led into the 
housing development. 

He drove slowly, looking close- 
ly at each house. All of them 
seemed empty. The windows 
stared blindly without drapes or 
curtains. The lawns had not been 
cut for weeks. There was no sign 
of anyone— and there should be 
children and pets playing. Al- 
most everyone he’d leased to had 
had children and dogs and cats. 
The place should be jumping, he 
told himself, and instead it was 
silent and deserted. 

He stopped the car and went 
into a house. It was bare and 
empty. There was sawdust in the 



comers and wood shavings here 
and there. There were no scuff 
marks on the floor, no handprints 
on the wall. The windows had not 
been washed; the trademark 
paper still was sticking to them. 

He went out puzzled. 

He inspected two more houses. 
They were the same. 

Steen had been right, then. 
Steen, with his shoes on the 
wrong feet, and with something 
else— with his different way of 
talking now. Six weeks ago, when 
Steen had come into Homer’s 
office, he had been stiff and for- 
mal, awkward, yet striving for 
preciseness. And now he was 
easy in his manner, now he put 
his feet up on the desk, now he 
talked slangily. 

There was no one living in the 
houses, Homer admitted to him- 
self. No one had ever lived in 
them. He had leased all fifty of 
them and no one had moved in. 

And it had a fishy smell— it 
had a terribly fishy smell. 

On his way out, he stopped at 
Steen’s office. The place was 
locked up. 

The old gateman opened the 
gate and waved at him from the 
window of his kiosk. 

B ACK in his own office, Homer 
took out of a drawer the 
list of leases he had drawn. He 
phoned Morgan, the first name 
on the lease.

“That number has been 
changed,” the operator told him. 

She gave him the new num- 
ber and he dialed it. 

“Happy Acres,” said a sing- 
song operator-voice. 

“Huh?” 

“Happy Acres,” the voice sang. 
“Whom did you wish, sir?” 

“The Morgan residence ” 

He waited and it was Morgan 
who answered. 

“Homer Jackson. Just check- 
ing. How do you like the house? 
Are you getting on okay?” 

“Perfectly,” Morgan told him 
happily. “I’ve been meaning to 
come in and thank you for put- 
ting me onto this.” 

“Everything is really all right?” 
“Couldn’t be better. I hardly 
ever go into my office now. I stay 
out here and work in the amuse- 
ment room. I go fishing and I 
take walks. The wife and kids are 
just as pleased as I am.” Mor- 
gan lowered his voice. “How do 
you guys manage this? I’ve tried 
to get it figured out and I can’t” 
“It’s a secret,” Homer replied, 
thinking on his feet. “The answer 
to the housing problem.” 

“Not that I care,” Morgan said. 
“Just curious, you know. Ill be 
dropping in one day. Ill bring 
you something.” 

“Glad to see you,” said Homer. 
He called the Happy Acres 
number and asked for another 
family. He went halfway through 



the list He talked mostly to the 
women, although some of the 
men were home. They were not 
only happy, but enthusiastic. 
They asked him jokingly how he 
got away with it. 

When he finished, he was 
glassy-eyed. 

He went down to the drugstore 
for a cup of coffee. 

When he returned, he’d made 
up his mind. 

He took out his waiting list 
and began making calls. 

‘There just happens to be a 
vacancy in Happy Acres if you 
are interested.” 

They were. 

He reminded them about the 
cars. They said they’d take care 
of that matter first thing in the 
morning. 

By suppertime, he’d leased 
twenty of the houses by making 
twenty phone calls.

64np HERE’S something wrong,” 

-■* Homer said to his wife. 
“But there’s money in it.” 

“It’s just that you don’t under- 
stand,” said Elaine. “There may 
be a perfectly good reason why 
Mr. Steen can’t explain it all to 
you.” 

“But it means we have to give 
up our trip to Europe. And after 
we had got our passports and 
all”

“We can go to Europe later. 
You’ll never get a chance like 
this again.” 

“It worries me,” said Homer. 
“Oh, you’re always worried 
oyer things that never even hap- 
pen. Mr. Steen is satisfied and 
the people you have leased to 
are, so why are you worrying?” 
“But where are these people? 
They aren’t living in the houses 
and yet they talk as if they were. 
And some of them asked me how 
I got away with it or words to 
that effect. They asked it as if 
they admired me for being slick 
in some kind of shady deal, and 
if it turns out that I am smart, 
I’d like to know just how I man- 
aged—” 

“Forget it,” Elaine said. “You 
aren’t smart and you never 
were. If I didn’t keep behind you, 
pushing all the time—” 

“Yes, dear,” said Homer. He’d 
heard it all before. 

“And quit your worrying.” 

He tried to, but he couldn’t 
The next morning, he drove to 
Happy Acres and parked across 
the road from the gate. From 7 
o’clock until 9, he counted 43 
cars coming out of the develop- 
ment. Some of the people in them 
he recognized as those he had 
leased the houses to. Many of 
them waved to him. 

At 9:30, he drove in through 
the gate and went slowly down 
the road. 



The houses still were empty. 

When he got back to the office, 
there were people waiting for 
him. The block was clogged with 
cars that gleamed with newness. 

He did a rushing business. No 
one, it turned out, was interested 
in seeing the houses. Most of 
them had seen them earlier. All 
they wanted was a lease. He filled 
out the forms as rapidly as he 
could and raked in the checks 
and cash. 

Some other people showed up. 
Word had got around, they said, 
that there were vacancies in the 
Happy Acres tract. Yes, he said, 
there were. Just a few of them. 
He reminded them about the cars. 

The last man in line, however, 
did not want to lease a house. 

“My name is Fowler,” he said. 
“I represent the Contractors and 
Builders Association. Maybe you 
can help me.” 

“I’ve got another house, if that 
is what you want,” said Homer. 

“I don’t need a house. I have 
one, thanks.” 

“Pay you to sell it and get in 
on this deal. The newest thing in 
housing. A completely new con- 
cept.” 

'C'OWLER shook his head. “All 
I want to know is, how do I 
get hold of Steen?” 

“No trouble at all,” said 
Homer. “You just go out to Hap- 
py Acres. He has an office there.” 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“I’ve been out there a dozen 
times. He is never in. Usually the 
office is locked.” 

“I never have any trouble find- 
ing him, although I don’t see him 
often. I’m too busy handling the 
property.” 

“Can you tell me how he does 
it, Mr. Jackson?” 

“How he does what? How he 
is always out?” 

“No. How he can sell a house 
for five thousand dollars.” 

“He doesn’t sell. He leases.” 
“Don’t pull that one on me. 
It’s the same as selling. And he 
can’t build for anywhere near 
that kind of money. He’s losing 
a good twenty thousand or more 
on every house out there.” 

“If a man wants to lose his 
money—” 

“Mr. Jackson,” said Fowler, 
“that is not the point at all. The 
point is that it’s unfair competi- 
tion.” 

“Not if he leases,” Homer 
pointed out. “If he sold, it might 
be.” 

“If this keeps on, it’ll put every 
contractor in the area out of busi- 
ness.” 

“That,” said Homer, “would be 
no more than simple justice in 
a lot of cases. They throw up a 
shack with plenty of glitter and 
charge a fancy price and—” 
“Nevertheless, Mr. Jackson, 
none of them intend to be put out 
of business.” 



“And you’re going to sue,” 
guessed Homer. 

“We certainly intend to.” 

“Don’t look at me. I only lease 
the places.” 

“We intend to get out an in- 
junction against your leasing 
them.” 

“You make the second one,” 
Homer informed him, annoyed. 

“The second what?” 

“The real estate boys sent a 
guy like you out here several 
weeks ago. He made a lot of 
threats and nothing’s happened 
yet. He was bluffing, just like 
you.” 

“Let me set your mind at rest,” 
said Fowler. “I’m not doing any 
bluffing.” 

He got up from his chair and 
stalked stiffly out. 

Homer looked at his watch. 
It was long past lunchtime. He 
went down to the drugstore for 
a sandwich and a cup of coffee. 
The place was empty and he 
had the counter to himself. 

He sat hunched over the lunch 
and thought about it, trying to 
get all the queer goings-on 
straightened out into some sort 
of logic. But the only thing he 
could think about was that Steen 
wore his shoes on the wrong feet. 

EARILY, still worried, 
Homer went back to the of- 
fice. There were people waiting, 
with their new cars parked out-

side. He leased houses right and 
left. 

Apparently the word was 
spreading. The house-seekers 
drifted in all afternoon. He leased 
four more houses before it was 
time to close. 

It was funny, he thought, very, 
very funny how the word had 
got around. He hadn’t advertised 
in the last three weeks and they 
still were coming in. 

Just as he was getting ready 
to lock up, Morgan strode in 
breezily. He had a package un- 
derneath his arm. 

“Here you are, pal,” he said. 
“I told you I’d bring you some- 
thing. Caught them just an hour 
or two ago.” 

The package was beginning to 
get soggy. Homer took it gingerly. 

“Thanks very much,” he said in 
a doubtful voice. 

“Think nothing of it. I’ll bring 
you more in a week or two.” 

As soon as Morgan left, Homer 
closed the blinds and unwrapped 
the package warily. 

Inside were brook trout— trout 
fresh-caught, with the ferns in 
which they had been wrapped 
not even wilting yet. 

And there was no trout stream 
closer than a couple of hundred 
miles! 

Homer stood and shivered. For 
there was no point in pretending 
ignorance, no point in repeating 
smugly to himself that it was all 



right. Even at five thousand a 
deal, there still was something 
wrong— very badly wrong. 

He had to face it. They were 
beginning to close in on him. 
Fowler had sounded as if he 
might mean business and the 
Real Estate Association undoubt- 
edly was lying in ambush, wait- 
ing for him to make one little 
slip. And when he made that 
slip, they’d snap the trap shut. 

To protect himself, he had to 
know what was going on. He 
could no longer go at it blind. 

Knowing, he might be able to 
go on. He might know when to 
quit. And that time, he told him- 
self, might have been as early as 
this afternoon. 

He stood there, with the fish 
and ferns lying in the wet wrap- 
ping paper on the desk, and en- 
visioned a long street of houses, 
and behind that long street of 
houses, another identical street 
of houses, and behind the second 
street, another— street after street, 
each behind the other, each 
exactly like the other, fading out 
of sight on a flat and level plain. 

A ND that was the way it must 
be— except there was no sec- 
ond street of houses. There was 
just the one, standing lone and 
empty, and yet, somehow, with 
people living in them.. 

Lease them a second time, 
Steen had said, and a third time 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




and a fourth. Don’t you worry 
about a thing. Let me handle it. 
Leave the worry all to me. You 
just keep on leasing houses. 

And Homer leased one house 
and the people moved, not into 
the house he’d leased them, but 
into the second identical house 
immediately behind it, and he 
leased the first house yet again 
and the people moved into the 
third, also identical, also directly 
behind the first and second house, 
and that was how it was. 

Except it was just a childish 
thing he had dreamed up to of- 
fer an explanation— any explana- 
tion— for a thing he couldn’t un- 
derstand. A fairy tale. 

He tried to get the idea back 
on the track again, tried to ra- 
tionalize it, but it was too weird. 

A man could trust his sense, 
couldn’t he? He could believe 
what he could see. And there 
were only fifty houses— empty 
houses, despite the fact that peo- 
ple lived in them. He could trust 
his ears and he had talked to peo- 
ple who were enthusiastic about 
living in those empty houses. 

It was crazy, Homer argued 
with himself. All those other folks 
were crazy— Steen and all the 
people living in the houses. 

He wrapped up the fish and 
retied the package clumsily. No 
matter where they came from, no 
matter what lunacy might pre- 
vail, those trout surely would 



taste good. And that, the taste 
of fresh-caught trout, was one of 
the few true, solid things left in 
the entire world. 

There was a creaking sound 
and Homer jumped in panic, 
whirling swiftly from the desk. 

The door was being opened! 
He’d forgotten to lock the door! 

The man who came in wore no 
uniform, but there was no doubt 
that he was a cop or detective. 

“My name is Hankins,” he 
said. He showed his badge to 
Homer. 

Homer shut his mouth tight to 
keep his teeth from chattering. 

“I think you may be able to do 
something for me,” Hankins said. 

“Surely,” Homer chattered. 
“Anything you say.” 

“You know a man named 
Dahl?” 

“I don’t think I do.” 

“Would you search your 
records?” 

“My records?” Homer echoed 
wildly. 

“Mr. Jackson, you’re a busi- 
nessman. Surely you keep rec- 
ords— the names of persons to 
whom you sell property and 
other things like that.” 

“Yes,” said Homer, all in a 
rush. “Yes, I keep that sort of 
record. Of course. Sure.” 

W ITH shaking hands, he 
pulled out a desk drawer 
and brought out the folder he’d

123 




set up on Happy Acres. He 
looked through it, fumbling at 
the papers. 

“I think I may have it,” he 
said. “Dahl, did you say the name 
was?” 

“John H. Dahl,” said Hankins. 

“Three weeks ago, I leased a 
house in Happy Acres to a John 
H. Dahl. Do you think he might 
be the one?” 

“Tall, dark man. Forty-three 
years old. Acts nervous.” 

Homer shook his head. “I don’t 
remember him. There have been 
so many people.” 

“Have you one there for Ben- 
ny August?” 

Homer searched again. “B. J. 
August. The day after Mr. Dahl.” 

“And perhaps a man named 
Drake? More than likely signs 
himself Hanson Drake.” 

Drake was also there. 

Hankins seemed well pleased. 
“Now how do I get to this Hap- 
py Acres place?” 

With a sinking feeling, Homer 
told him how. 

He gathered up his fish and 
walked outside with Hankins. He 
stood and watched the officer 
drive away. He wouldn’t want to 
be around, he suspected, when 
Hankins returned from Happy 
Acres. He hoped with all his 
heart that Hankins wouldn’t look 
him up. 

He locked up the office and 
went down to the drugstore to 



buy a paper before going home. 

He unfolded it and the head- 
lines leaped at him: 

THREE HUNTED IN 
STOCK SWINDLE 

Three photographs on column 
cuts were ranged underneath the 
headline. He read the names in 
turn. Dahl. August. Drake. 

He folded the paper tightly 
and thrust it beneath his arm 
and he felt the sweat begin to 
trickle. 

Hankins would never find his 
men, he knew. No one would ever 
find them. In Happy Acres, 
they’d be safe. It was, he began 
to see, a ready-made hideout for 
all kinds of hunted men. 

He wondered how many of 
the others he had leased the 
houses to might be hunted, too. 
No wonder, he thought, the word 
had spread so quickly. No won- 
der his office had been filled all 
day with people who’d already 
bought the cars. 

And what was it all about? 
How did it work? Who had fig- 
ured it all out? 

And why did he, Homer Jack- 
son, have to be the one who’d 
get sucked into it? 

Elaine took a searching look at 
him as he came in the door. 

“You’ve been worrying,” she 
scolded. 

Homer lied most nobly. “Not 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




worrying. Just a little tired.” 
Scared to death would have 
been closer to the truth. 

IX 

AT 9 o’clock next morning, he 
drove to Happy Acres. He 
was inside the door before he 
saw that Steen was busy. The 
man who had been talking to 
Steen swung swiftly from the 
desk. 

“Oh, it’s you,” he said. 

Homer saw that the man was 
Hankins. 

Steen smiled wearily. “Mr. 
Hankins seems to think that 
we’re obstructing justice.” 

“I can’t imagine,” Homer said, 
“why he should think that.” 
Hankins was on the edge of 
rage. “Where are these people? 
What have you done with them?” 
Steen said: “I’ve told you, Mr. 
Hankins, that we only lease the 
property. We cannot undertake 
to go surety for anybody who 
may lease from us.” 

“You’ve hidden them!” 

“How could we hide them, Mr. 
Hankins? Where could we hide 
them? The entire development 
is open to you. You can search 
it to your heart’s content.” 

“I don’t know what is going 
on,” said Hankins savagely, “but 
I’m going to find out. And once 
I do, both of you had better have 
your explanations ready.” 



“I think,” Steen commented, 
“that Mr. Hankins’ determination 
and deep sense of duty are very 
splendid things. Don’t you, Mr. 
Jackson?” 

“I do, indeed,” said Homer, at 
loss as to what to say. 

“You’ll be saying that out of 
the other side of your mouth be- 
fore I’m through with you,” Han- 
kins promised them. 

He went storming out the door. 

“What a nasty man,” Steen 
remarked, unconcerned. 

Tm getting out,” said Homer. 
“I’ve got a pocket full of checks 
and cash. As soon as I turn them 
over, I am pulling out. You can 
find someone else to do your 
dirty work.” 

“Now I am sorry to hear that. 
And just when you were doing 
well. There’s a lot of money to be 
made.” 

“It’s too risky.” 

“I grant you that it may ap- 
pear a little risky, but actually 
it’s not. Men like Hankins will 
raise a lot of dust, but what can 
they really do? We are com- 
pletely in the clear.” 

“We’re leasing the same 
houses over and over again.” 

‘Why, certainly,” said Steen. 
“How else would you expect me 
to build up the kind of clientele 
I need to give me business vol- 
ume in this shopping center? 
You yourself have told me that 
fifty families were by no means 



CARBON COPY 



125 




enough. And you were right, of 
course. But you lease the houses 
ten times and you have five hun- 
dred families, which is not bad. 
Lease each one a hundred times 
and you have five thousand— And 
incidentally, Mr. Jackson, by the 
time you lease each of them a 
hundred times, you will have 
made yourself twenty-five mil- 
lion dollars, which is not a bad 
amount for a few years’ work. 

“Because,” Steen concluded, 
“you see, despite what you may 
have thought of me, I’m squarely 
on the level. I gave you the 
straight goods. I told you I was 
not interested in money from the 
houses, but merely from the 
shopping center.” 

TT OMER tried to pretend that 
he was unimpressed. He 
kept on emptying checks and 
wads of money from his pockets. 
Steen reached out for the checks 
and began endorsing them. He 
stacked the money neatly. 

“I wish you would reconsider, 
Mr. Jackson,” he urged. “I have 
need of a man like you. You’ve 
worked out so satisfactorily, I 
hate to see you go.” 

“Come clean with me,” said 
Homer, “and I might stay. Tell 
me all there is to tell— how it 
all works and what all the angles 
are and what you plan to do.” 

Steen laid a cautionary finger 
across his lips. “Hush! You don’t 



know what you’re asking.” 

“You mean you see no trouble 
coming?” 

“Some annoyance, perhaps. 
Not real trouble.” 

“They could throw the book 
at us if they could prove we were 
hiding people wanted by the 
law.” 

Steen sighed deeply. “Mr. 
Jackson, how many fugitives have 
you sheltered in the last six 
weeks?” 

“Not a one,” said Homer. 

“Neither have I.” Steen spread 
his arms wide. “So we have 
nothing to fear. We’ve done no 
wrong. At least,” he amended, 
“none that they can prove.” 

He picked up the money and 
the checks and handed them to 
Homer. 

“Here,” he said ; “You might as 
well take it to the bank. It’s your 
money.” 

Homer took the money and the 
checks and stood with them in 
his hand, thinking about what 
Steen had said about not doing 
any wrong. Maybe Steen was 
right. Maybe Homer was getting 
scared when there was no need 
to be. 

What could they be charged 
with? 

Fraudulent advertising? There 
had been no specific claims that 
had not been performed. 

For tying in the auto sales? 
Just possibly, although he had 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




not made an auto sale a condi- 
tion of transaction; he had mere- 
ly mentioned that it would be 
very nice if they bought a car 
from Happy Acres Auto Sales. 

For selling at less than cost? 
Probably not, for it would be a 
fine point of law to prove a lease 
a sale. And selling or leasing be- 
low cost in any case was no 
crime. 

For leasing the same house 
more than once? Certainly not 
until it could be proved that 
someone had suffered damage 
and it was most unlikely that it 
could be proved. 

For doing away with people? 
But those people could be 
reached by telephone, could 
drive out through the gate. And 
they were well and happy and 
enthusiastic. 

“Perhaps,” Steen said gently, 
“you have changed your mind. 
Perhaps you’ll stay with us.” 

“Perhaps I will,” said Homer. 

IT E walked down the concourse 
to the bank. It was an im- 
pressive place. The foyer was 
resplendent in coppery metal 
and with brightly polished mir- 
rors. There were birds in hang- 
ing cages and some of the birds 
were singing. 

There were no customers, but 
the bank was spic and span. An 
alert vice-president sat behind his 
polished desk without a thing to 



do. An equally alert teller waited 
shiny-faced behind the wicked 
window. 

Homer walked to the window 
and shoved through the money 
and the checks. He took his pass- 
book from his pocket and handed 
it across. 

The teller looked at it and 
said, “I’m sorry, Mr. Jackson, but 
you have no account with us.” 

“No account!” cried Homer. “I 
have a quarter of a million!” 

His heart went plunk into his 
boots, and if he’d had Steen there, 
he’d have broken him to bits. 

“No,” said the teller calmly, 
“you’ve made an error. That is 
all.” 

“Error!” gasped Homer, hang- 
ing onto the window to keep from 
keeling over. 

“An understandable error,” the 
teller said sympathetically. “One 
that anyone could make. Your 
account is not with us, but with 
the Second Bank.” 

“Second Bank,” wheezed 
Homer. “What are you talking 
about? This is the only bank 
there is.” 

“Look, it says Second Bank 
right here.” He showed Homer 
the passbook. It did say Second 
Happy Acres State Bank. 

“Well, now,” said Homer, 
“that’s better. Will you tell me 
how I get to this Second Bank?” 

“Gladly, sir. Right over there. 
Just go through that door.” 



CARBON COPY 



127 




He handed back the passbook 
and the money. 

“That door, you say?” inquired 
Homer. 

“Yes. The one beside the drink- 
ing fountain.” 

Homer clutched the passbook 
and the money tightly in his 
hand and headed for the door. 
He opened it and stepped inside 
and got it shut behind him be- 
fore he realized that he was in 
a closet. 

It was just a tiny place, not 
much bigger than a man, and it 
was as black as the inside of a 
cat. 

Sweat started out on Homer 
and he searched frantically for 
the doorknob and finally found 
it. 

He pushed the door open and 
stumbled out. He strode wrath- 
fully back across the foyer to 
the teller's window. He rapped 
angrily on the ledge and the tel- 
ler turned around. 

“What kind of trick is this?” 
yelled Homer. “What do you 
think you’re pulling? What is go- 
ing on here? That is nothing but 
a closet.” 

“I’m sorry, sir,” the teller said. 
“My fault. I forgot to give you 
this.” 

He reached into his cash 
drawer and handed Homer a 
small object It looked for all the 
world like the replica of a bizarre 
radiator ornament. 

128 



J UGGLING the object in his 
hand, Homer asked, “What 
has this got to do with it?” 

“Everything,” the teller said. 
“It will get you to the Second 
Bank. Don’t lose it. You’ll need 
it to get back.” 

“You mean I just hold it in 
my hand?” 

“That is all you do, sir,” the 
teller assured him. 

Homer went back to the door, 
still unconvinced. It was all a lot 
of mumbo-jumbo, he told him- 
self. These guys were just the 
same as Gabby Wilson— full of 
smart pranks. And if that teller 
was making a fool of him, he 
promised himself, he’d mop up 
the floor with him. 

He opened the door and 
stepped into the closet, only it 
was no closet. It was another 
bank. 

The metal still was coppery 
and the mirrors were a-glitter and 
the birds were singing, but there 
were customers. There were three 
tellers instead of the single one 
in the first bank and the bland, 
smooth vice-president at his 
shiny desk was industriously at 
work. 

Homer stood quietly just out- 
side the door through which he’d 
come from the other bank. The 
customers seemed not to have 
noticed him, but as he looked 
them over, he was startled to 
discover that there were many 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




whose faces were familiar. 

Here, then, were the people 
who had leased the houses, go- 
ing about their business in the 
Second Bank. 

He put the miniature radiator 
ornament in his pocket and 
headed for the window that 
seemed to be least busy. He 
waited in line while the man 
ahead of him finished making a 
deposit. 

Homer could only see the back 
of the man’s head, but the head 
seemed to be familiar. He stood 
there raking through the memo- 
ries of the people he had met in 
the last six weeks. 

Then the man turned around 
and Homer saw that it was Dahl. 
It was the same face he had seen 
staring at him from the front 
page of the paper only the night 
before. 

“Hello, Mr. Jackson,” said 
Dahl. “Long time no see.” 

Homer gulped. “Good day, 
Mr. Dahl. How do you like the 
house?” 

“Just great, Mr. Jackson. It’s so 
quiet and peaceful here, I can’t 
tear myself away from it.” 

I bet you can’t, thought 
Homer. 

“Glad to hear you say so,” he 
said aloud, and stepped up to 
the window. 

The teller glanced at the pass- 
book. “Good to see you, Mr. 
Jackson. The president, I think, 



would like to see you, too. Would 
you care to step around after I 
finish your deposit?” 

TTOMER left the teller’s win- 
dow, feeling a little chilly at 
the prospect of seeing the presi- 
dent, wondering what the presi- 
dent might want and what new 
trouble it portended. 

A hearty voice told him to 
come when he knocked on the 
door. 

The president was a beefy 
gentleman and extremely pleas- 
ant. 

“I've been hoping you’d come 
in,” he said. “I don’t know if 
you realize it or not, but you’re 
our biggest depositor.” 

He shook Homer’s hand most 
cordially and motioned him to a 
chair. He gave him a cigar and 
Homer, a good judge of tobacco, 
figured it for at least a fifty- 
center. 

The president, puffing a little, 
sat down behind his desk. 

“This is a good setup here,” 
said Homer, to get the conversa- 
tion started. 

“Oh, yes,” the president said. 
“Most splendid. It’s just a test, 
though, you know.” 

“No, I hadn’t known that” 

“Yes, surely. To see if it will 
work. If it does, we will embark 
on much bigger projects — ones 
that will prove even more eco- 
nomically feasible. One never

knows, of course, how an idea will 
catch on. You can run all the 
preliminary observations and 
make innumerable surveys and 
still never know until you try it 
out.” 

“That’s true,” said Homer, won- 
dering what in the world the 
president was talking about. 

“Once we get it all worked out,” 
the president said, “we can turn 
it over to the natives.” 

“I see. You’re not a native 
here?” 

“Of course not. I am from the 
city.” 

And that, thought Homer, was 
a funny thing to say. He watched 
the man closely, but there was 
nothing in his face to indicate 
that he had misspoken — no flush 
of embarrassment, no sign of 
flurry. 

“I’m especially glad to have a 
chance to see you,” Homer told 
him. “As a matter of fact, I had 
been thinking of switching my 
account and — ” 

The president’s face took on a 
look of horror. “But why? Cer- 
tainly you’ve been told about the 
tax advantages.” 

“I think that the matter got 
some mention. But, I must con- 
fess, I don’t understand.” 

“Why, Mr. Jackson, it is simple. 
No mystery at all. So far as the 
authorities of your country are 
concerned — ” 

“My country?” 



“Well, of course. I think it 
might logically be argued, even 
in a court of law, that this place 
we’re in is no longer the United 
States of America. But even if it 
should be a part of your great 
nation — I doubt that such a con- 
tention would hold up if put to 
the decision — why, even so, our 
records are not available to the 
agents of your country. Don’t tell 
me you fail to see the implica- 
tions of a situation such as that.” 
“The income tax,” Homer said. 
“Correct,” said the president, 
smiling very blandly. 

“That is interesting. Interest- 
ing, indeed.” Homer rose and held 
out his hand to the president. 
“I’ll be in again.” 

“Thank you,” said the presi- 
dent. “Drop in any time you 
wish.” 

O N the street outside the bank, 
the sun was shining brightly. 
The shopping center stretched 
along the mall and there were 
people here and there, walking 
on the concourse or shopping in 
the stores. A few cars were parked 
in the lot and the world of this 
Second Bank looked exactly like 
the First Bank’s world, and if a 
man had not known the differ- 
ence — 

Good Lord, thought Homer, 
what was the difference? What 
had really happened? He’d walked 
through the door and there was 



130

eS.Vb> m»- 



the other bank. He’d walked 
through a door and found the 
missing people — the people who 
had not been living in the empty 
houses of the First Bank’s world. 

Because that other world where 
the houses still stood empty was 
no more than a show window? It 
might simply be a street lined 
with demonstration homes. And 
here was that second street of 
houses he’d dreamed up the other 
night. And beyond this second 
street, would there be another 
street and another and another? 

He stumbled along the con- 
course, shaken, now that he re- 
alized there really was that second 
street of houses. It was an idea 
that was hard to take in stride. 
He didn’t take it in his stride. His 
mind balked and shied away from 
it and he told himself it wasn’t 
true. But it was true and there 
was no way to rationalize it, to 
make it go away. 

There was a second street! 

He walked along and saw that 
he was near the gate. The gate, 
he saw, was the same as ever, 
with its expanse of massive iron. 
But there was no gateman. 

And a car was coming up the 
road, heading directly for the 
gate, and it was moving fast, as 
if the driver did not see the gate. 

Homer shouted and the car 
kept on. He started to run, wav- 
ing his arms, but the driver paid 
not the least attention. 



The crazy fool, thought Homer. 
He’ll hit the gate and — 

And the car hit the gate, 
slammed into it, but there was no 
sound, no crash, no screech of 
rending metal. There was simply 
nothing. 

The gate was there, undented. 
And there was no car. The car 
had disappeared. 

Homer stalked the gate. 

Ten feet away, he stopped. 

The road came up to the gate; 
beyond it was no road. Beyond 
the gate was wilderness. The road 
came up and ended and the 
wilderness began. 

Cautiously, Homer walked out 
into the road and peered through 
the gate. 

Just a few feet away, a giant 
oak towered into the air and be- 
hind it was the forest, wild and 
hoary and primeval, and in the 
forest was the happy sound, the 
abandoned sound of water run- 
ning in a brook. 

Fish, thought Homer. Maybe 
that brook is where the trout 
came from. 

T¥ E moved toward the gate for 
a closer look and reached out 
his hands to grasp the ironwork. 
Even as he did, the forest went 
away and the gate as well as he 
stood in the old familiar entrance 
to Happy Acres, with the gate 
wide open, with the state high- 
way running along the wall and 



132

the road from the development 
running out to meet it. 

“Good morning, sir,” said the 
gateman. “Maybe you ought to 
move over to one side. A car is 
apt to hit you.” 

“Huh?” Homer asked blankly. 

“A car. This is a road, you 
know.” 

Homer turned around and 
brushed past the gateman. He 
hustled down the concourse, aim- 
ing for Steen’s office. 

But the office was locked. 
Homer shook the door. He rapped 
wildly on the glass. He pounded 
on the frame. Absolutely nothing 
happened. 

Turning from the door, he 
stared out across the develop- 
ment with incredulous eyes — 
the vacant concourse, the empty 
houses among the trees, the faint 
patches of shining lake peeking 
through the clearings. 

He jammed his hands into his 
pockets and his fingers touched 
the little radiator ornament. He 
took it out and looked at it. He’d 
seen it before — not the little 
replica, but the ornament itself. 

He had seen it, he remembered, 
on the new cars parked outside 
his office by the people seeking 
leases. He had seen it on the car 
that had crashed the gate and 
disappeared. 

He walked slowly to the park- 
ing lot and drove home. 

“I don’t think I’ll go back to 



the office today,” he told Elaine. 
“I don’t feel so good.” 

“You’ve been working too hard,” 
she told him accusingly. “You 
look all worn out.” 

“That’s a fact,” he admitted. 
“After lunch, you lie down. And 
see that you get some sleep.” 
“Yes, dear,” he said. 

S O it began to fall into a pat- 
tern, he thought, lying on his 
bed and staring at the ceiling. Fi- 
nally it was clear enough so a man 
could begin to make some head 
and tail of it 

It was unbelievable, but there 
was no choice — one could not 
disbelieve in it. It was there to 
see. And if one looked at it any 
other way, it made no sense at all. 

Someone — Steen, perhaps, or 
maybe someone else for whom 
Steen was serving as a front — 
had found out how to build one 
house, yet have many houses, 
houses stretching back street after 
street from the first house, all 
shadows of the first house, but 
substantial just the same — sub- 
stantial enough for families to 
live in. 

Dimensional extensions of that 
first house. Or houses stretching 
into time. Or something else as 
weird. 

But however they might do it, 
it was a swell idea. For you could 
build one house and sell it, or 
lease it, time and time again. Ex-

cept that one was crazy to get 
hold of an idea that was as good 
as that and then let someone else 
make all the money from the 
leasing of the houses. 

And there was no question that 
Steen was crazy. That idea he 
had about the shopping center 
was completely batty — although, 
stop to think of it, if one had five 
thousand houses and leased each 
of them ten times and had a 
monopoly on all the shops and 
stores — why, it would pay off 
tremendously. 

And the bank president’s slant 
on sovereignty had certain angles, 
too, that should not be over- 
looked. 

A new idea in housing, Steen 
had told him. It was all of that. 
It was a new idea that would 
apply to many things — to in- 
dustry and farming and mining 
and a lot of other ventures. A 
man could make one car and 
there would be many others. A 
man could build a manufacturing 
plant and he would have many 
plants. 

It was like a carbon copy, 
Homer thought — an economic 
carbon copy. And a man appar- 
ently could make as many car- 
bons as he wished. Possibly, he 
speculated, once you knew the 
principle, there was no limit to 
the carbons. Possibly the ghostly 
parade of Happy Acres house 
stretched limitless, forever and 



forever. There might be no end 
to them. 

He fell asleep and dreamed of 
going down a line of ghostly 
houses, counting them frantically 
as he ran along, hoping that he’d 
soon get to the end of them, for 
he couldn’t quit until he did get 
to the end. But they always 
stretched ahead of him, as far as 
he could see, and he could find 
no end to them. 

He woke, damp with perspira- 
tion, his tongue a dry and bitter 
wad inside a flannel mouth. He 
crept out of bed and went to the 
bathroom. He held his head under 
a cold faucet. It helped, but not 
much. 

D ownstairs, he found a 

note that Elaine had propped 
against the radio on the breakfast 
table: Gone to play bridge at 
Mabel's. Sandwiches in refrigera- 
tor. 

It was dark outside. He’d slept 
the daylight hours away. A wasted 
day, he berated himself — a com- 
pletely wasted day. He hadn’t 
done a dollar’s worth of work. 

He found some milk and drank 
it, but left the sandwiches where 
they were. 

He might as well go to the 
office and get a little work done, 
compensate in part for the wasted 
day. Elaine wouldn’t return until 
almost midnight and there was 
no sense in staying home alone.

He got his hat and went out 
to where he’d parked the car in 
the driveway. He got into it and 
sat down on something angular 
and hard. He hoisted himself 
wrathfully and searched the seat 
with a groping hand to find the 
thing he’d sat on. 

His fingers closed about it and 
then he remembered. He’d sat on 
it on that day Morgan had showed 
up in answer to the ad. It had 
been rolling around ever since, 
unnoticed in the seat. 

It was smooth to the touch and 
warm — warmer than it should be 
— as if there were a busy little 
motor humming away inside it. 

And suddenly it winked. 

He caught his breath and it 
flashed again. 

Exactly like a signal. 

Instinct told him to get rid of 
it, to heave it out the window, 
but a voice suddenly spoke out 
of it — a thick, harsh voice that 
mouthed a sort of chant he could 
not recognize. 

“What the hell?” chattered 
Homer, fearful now. “What’s 
going on?” 

The chanting voice ceased and 
a heavy silence fell, so thick and 
frightening that Homer imagined 
he could feel it closing in on him. 

The voice spoke again. This 
time, it was one word, slow and 
labored, as if the thick, harsh 
tongue drove itself to create a 
new and alien sound. 



The silence fell again and there 
was a sense of waiting. Homer 
huddled in the seat, cold with 
fear. 

For now he could guess where 
the cube had come from. Steen 
had ridden in the car with him 
and it had fallen from his pocket. 

The voice took up again : “Urrr 
— urr — urrth — mum!” 

Homer almost screamed. 

Rustling, panting sounds whis- 
pered from the cube. 

Earthman? Homer wondered 
wildly. Was that what it had tried 
to say? 

And if that was right, if the 
cube in fact had been lost by 
Steen, then it meant that Steen 
was not a man at all. 

1LTE thought of Steen and the 
-*"*■ way he wore his shoes and 
suddenly it became understand- 
able why he might wear his shoes 
that way. Perhaps, where Steen 
came from, there was no left or 
right, maybe not even shoes. No 
man could expect an alien, a 
being from some distant star, to 
get the hang of all Earth’s cus- 
toms — not right away, at least. 
He recalled the first day Steen 
had come into the office and, the 
precise way he had talked and 
how stiffly he’d sat down in the 
chair. And that other day, feix 
weeks later, when Steen had 
talked slangily and had sat 
slouched in his chair, with his

feet planted on the desk. 

Learning, Homer thought. 
Learning all the time. Getting to 
know his way around, getting 
the feel of things, like a gawky 
country youth learning city ways. 

But it sure was a funny thing 
that he’d never learned about 
the shoes. 

The cube went on gurgling and 
panting and the thick voice mut- 
tered and spat out alien words. 
One could sense the tenseness 
and confusion at the other end. 

Homer sat cold and rigid, with 
horror seeping into him drop by 
splashing drop, while the cube 
blurted over and over a single 
phrase that meant not a thing 
to him. 

Then, abruptly, the cube went 
dead. It lay within his hand, cool- 
ing, silent, just a thing that looked 
and felt like a clip-together plas- 
tic block for children. 

From far off, he heard the roar 
of a car as it left the curb and 
sped off in the night. From some- 
one’s backyard, a cat meowed for 
attention. Nearby, a bird cheeped 
sleepily. 

Homer opened the glove com- 
partment and tossed the cube in 
among the rags and scraper and 
the dog-eared roadmap and the 
other odds and ends. 

He felt the terror and the 
loathing and the wild agony be- 
gin to drain out of his bones and 
he sat quietly in the car, trying 



to readjust his mind to this new 
situation — that Steen must be an 
alien. 

He dipped his hand into his 
pocket and found the replica of 
the radiator ornament. And that 
was the key, he knew — not only 
the key to the many streets of 
homes, but the key to Steen and 
the alien world. 

They hadn’t meant for him to 
keep the ornament, of course. If 
he had returned the way he’d 
entered into the world of the 
Second Bank, the teller more than 
likely would have demanded that 
he give it back. But he’d returned 
another way, an unexpected way, 
and it still was in his pocket. 

And the radiator ornament, of 
course, was the reason that Steen 
had insisted that anyone who 
leased a house must also buy a 
car. For the ornament was a key 
that bridged one world and 
another. Although, thought 
Homer, it was rather drastic to 
insist that a man should buy a 
car simply so he’d have the cor- 
rect radiator ornament. 

But that might be the way, he 
told himself, that an alien mind 
would work. 

He was calmer now. The fear 
still lingered, but pushed back, 
buried just a little. 

T^XACTLY how is a man sup- 
posed to act, he asked him- 
self, when he learns there are 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




aliens in the land? Run screech- 
ing through the streets, rouse all 
the citizens, alert the law, go bay- 
ing on the trail? Or does he con- 
tinue about his business? 

Might he not, he wondered, 
take advantage of his knowledge, 
turn it to his own benefit? 

He was the only human being 
on all of Earth who knew. 

Steen might not like it known 
that he was an alien. Perhaps it 
would be worth a lot to Steen not 
to have it known. 

Homer sat and thought about 
it. The more he thought, the more 
reasonable it seemed that Steen 
might be ready to lay plenty on 
the line to keep the fact a secret. 

Not that I don’t have it coming 
to me, Homer told himself. Not 
that he hasn’t caused me a heap 
of worry and trouble. 

He put his hand into his pocket. 
The miniature ornament was 
there. There was no need to wait. 
Now was as good as any time. 

He turned the ignition key 
and the motor came to life. He 
backed out of the driveway and 
took the road to Happy Acres. 

The development was dark and 
quiet. Even the usual advertising 
signs were turned off in the shop 
fronts. 

He parked in front of Steen’s 
office and got out. Opening the 
trunk, he found the jack handle 
in the dark. 

He stood staring toward the 



gate. There was no sign of the 
gateman. But that was a chance 
he’d have to take. If the old fool 
tried to interfere, he could handle 
him. 

For a moment, in front of the 
door to Steen’s office, he hesitated, 
trying to reassure himself. Cer- 
tainly there would be another 
closet, some way to get to those 
other worlds, inside the office. 

He struck savagely at the glass 
in the door with the jack handle. 
The glass splintered and rained 
down, with crashing, tinkling 
sounds. 

Homer waited, tense, listening, 
watching. Nothing stirred. The 
old gateman, if he was around, 
apparently had not heard the 
crash. 

Carefully, Homer reached 
through the broken glass and 
manipulated the night lock. The 
door swung easily open. He 
walked inside and closed the door 
behind him. 

T N the empty office, Homer 
paused until his eyes became ac- 
customed to the deeper darkness. 
He moved forward, groping with 
his hands, and found the desk. 
He could make out the dim bulk 
of a filing case. There should be 
a door somewhere. Perhaps not 
a door into the street, but a door 
into a hideout— some room where 
Steen could disappear to eat and 
rest and sleep; some place that 



CARBON COPY 



137 





might have a touch of his alien 
home about it. 

Homer moved from the desk 
to the filing cabinet and felt along 
the wall. Almost immediately, he 
found a door. 

He took a firmer grip on the 
jack handle and twisted on the 
knob. He walked through the 
door and there was the room, 
lighted a garish green by a lan- 
tern suspended from the ceiling. 

There was sound and the sense 
of movement. Homer’s hair stood 
straight on end and he felt his 
skin trying very hard to roll up 
his back. The hairy monster 
reached out a paw and grabbed 
him by the shoulder just as 
Homer swung around to dive 
back through the door. 

The monster’s paw was heavy 
and very strong. It was hairy 
and it tickled. Homer opened his 
mouth to scream, but his tongue 
dried up and his throat closed 
and he couldn’t make a sound. 
The jack handle slipped from his 
numb fingers and clattered to the 
floor. 

For a long moment, he stood 
there in the grip of the hairy 
monster and he supposed it had 
a face, but he could not see the 
face, for the hair grew all over it 
and drooped down where its face 
should be. The monster was a 
large one, with massive chest 
and shoulders that tapered down 
to a slim, athletic waist. Fright- 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ened as he was, Homer still could 
not keep from thinking that it 
looked a lot like an English sheep- 
dog with a wrestler’s body. 

And all the while, there was 
something rolling on the floor and 
moaning. 

Then the hairy monster said, 
in halting, stumbling syllables: 
“You Mister Jackson, you are 
not?” 

Homer made a croaking sound. 

“I apologize,” the monster told 
him. “I very poor at your words. 
I work on your planet survey, 
but not so good with words.” 

He motioned at the thing 
moaning and rolling on the floor. 
“That was good with words.” 

The hairy hand dropped from 
Homer’s shoulder. 

“That,” it said, gesturing at the 
floor again, “your Mister Steen.” 

‘What is wrong with him?” 
Homer blurted out. “Is he sick 
or something?” 

“He die himself,” the monster 
said. 

“You mean he’s dying and 
you’re just standing there — ” 

“No, no. He — how do you 
word it right? — he unlive him- 
self.” 

“You mean he’s killing him- 
self? Committing suicide?” 

“Yes,” the monster said. “He 
does it very well. Do you not 
agree?” 

“But you can’t — ” 

“He take great pride in it. He

make spectacular. He just start- 
ing now. He work up to grand 
finale. You must stay and watch. 
It be something to remember.” 

“No, thank you,” Homer said 
faintly. 

TTOMER turned to go, but the 
monster put out a hairy paw 
and stopped him. 

“You must not be afraid of us. 
I stay half myself, all right? 
Could change entirely into hu- 
man, but much trouble. Good 
enough this way?” 

“It’s all right,” said Homer. 

“We owe you debt,” the mon- 
ster said. “This Mister Steen of 
yours got things all scrambled 
up.” 

“I’ll say he did,” said Homer 
feelingly. 

“He just a stumblebum. Bung- 
ler. He likewise is a joker.” 
“Joker?” 

“Clown? Wise guy? You know 
— he made the joke. Sometimes 
very sly joke, but stupid just 
the same.” 

The monster leaned forward to 
peer into Homer’s face. 

“Your planet, it has its jokers, 
too?” 

“Yes, indeed,” Homer said. 
“There’s one down the hall from 
me. His name is Gabby Wilson.” 

“So you understand then. A 
joker not too bad if that is all he 
is. But take a joker who makes 
mistakes and that is most bad. 



You have name for it. Smart 
aleck?” 

“That’s the name,” said Homer. 

“We make projects for the 
planets, for very many planets. 
We try to make each project fit 
the planet. The kind that will 
help the planet, the kind it needs 
the most.” 

“Like foreign aid,” Homer 
supplied. 

“So this bungler,” said the mon- 
ster, his voice rising in forthright 
and honest wrath, “this smart 
aleck, this nincompoop, this Mis- 
ter Steen of yours, what do you 
think he does? He came to Earth 
as project manager — and he 
brings wrong plan! He is like that 
other times, going off not cocked. 
But this, it is too much. Final 
straw.” 

“You mean this Happy Acres 
business was never meant for 
Earth, but for some other 
planet?” 

The monster draped his arm 
around Homer’s shoulder in a 
gesture of understanding and af- 
fection. “That exactly what he 
do. No need of Happy Acres here. 
You still have room enough for 
all your people. No need to 
double up.” 

“But, sir,” said Homer earnest- 
ly, “it is a swell idea. It has pos- 
sibilities.” 

“Other things you need much 
worse, my friend. We have better 
plan for you.” 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Homer couldn’t decide whether 
he liked the way the monster 
talked about the better plan. 
“What other plan?” he asked. 
“That is topmost secret. To 
make project big success, it must 
be done so that the natives think 
they the ones who do it. And 
that,” the monster said, gesturing 
toward the floor, “is where this 
silly obscenity failed in second 
place. He let you find, out what 
was going on.” 

UT there were all the other 
people, too,” Homer pro- 
tested. “All the people in the 
shops. The bank president and 
the gateman and—” 

“All of them is us,” the monster 
explained. “Them the crew that 
came with Mister Steen.” 

“But they were so human-look- 
ing! They looked exactly like us!” 
“They play it straight. This 
ape, he ham it up.” 

“But they dressed like us and 
they wore their shoes—” 

“The shoes was more joke,” 
the monster said furiously. “Your 
Mister Steen, he know how to 
make himself a human like the 
rest of them. But he wear his 
shoes wrong to get you humans— 
your humans’ — there is a word 
for it.” 

“Goat?” 

“That is it! He wear them 
wrong to get your humans’ goat. 
And he make outrageous deal 



with you and he watch you wor- 
ry and he rejoice greatly and 
think himself superior and smart 
because he that kind of clown. 
That, I tell you, is no way to treat 
anyone. That is no true-blue 
friendship. But your Mister Steen, 
he was plain jerk. Let us go and 
watch him suffer.” 

“No,” said Homer, horrified. 
“You no like this dying?” 

“It’s inhuman.” 

“Of course, inhuman. We not 
humans, us. It is a way we have, 
a social law. He make himself a 
fool. He make bonehead blunder. 
He must dead himself. He must 
do it good. Great honor, do it 
good. He bungle everything in 
life, he must not bungle dying. 
He forever heel if he do.” 

Homer shivered, listening to 
the anguish of the alien on the 
floor, sick at stomach and giddy 
in the green flood of alien light. 

“Now it is to end,” said the 
alien. “We wipe out project. It 
was nonsensical mistake. We will 
take it all away.” 

“You can’t mean that!” argued 
Homer. “We need it. We could 
make use of it. Just show us the 
principle.” 

“No,” the monster said. 

“But if you wipe out the proj- 
ect, there’ll be all these people—” 
“Sorry.” 

“They’ll murder me! I was the 
one who leased the house to 
them—”

“Too bad,” the monster said. 

“And all that money in the 
bank! A quarter of a million dol- 
lars, more than a quarter of a 
million dollars! It will be wiped 
out!” 

“You have human money in 
bank?” 

“I did. I suppose thafs too bad, 
too.” 

“We can pay you off. Mister 
Steen make lot of money. He 
store it over there.” 

TTE pointed to the far wall. 

“You see that pile of bags? 
You take all that you can car- 
ry.” 

“Money?” Homer asked. 

“Good money/ 7 

“All I can carry?” insisted 
Homer, nailing it down tight. 
“And you will let me leave?” 

“We do you wrong,” the mon- 
ster said. “This fix it just a little?” 

“I’ll tell the world,” said 
Homer, with enthusiasm. 

Steen was becoming noisier. 
He had changed into his alien 
form and now he rolled upon the 
floor, knotted up and writhing. 

Homer walked wide around 
him to get to the farther wall. He 
lifted down the bags and they 
were fairly heavy. He could take 
two at least, he figured. He hoisted 
two on his back, then piled on 
the third. He barely made it back 
across the room. 

The monster watched him with 



some admiration. “You like the 
money, huh?” 

“You bet,” Homer panted. 
“Everyone likes money.” 

He set the bags down by the 
door. 

“You sure you not stay and 
watch? It get good directly. It 
be amusing, maybe even interest- 
ing.” 

Homer held down a rising 
shudder. “No, thank you very 
much.” 

The monster helped him get 
the bags on his shoulder. “I hold 
the door for you.” 

“Thank you,” said Homer. 
“Good day to you and thanks 
for everything.” 

“Good-by, my friend,” the 
monster said. 

He held the door and Homer 
walked on through. 

He came back into the office 
he’d left an hour before. The 
glass in the door shattered and 
his car was parked outside. 

Homer hurried. 

In less than five minutes, he 
went roaring out the gate, with 
the bags of money locked inside 
the trunk. 

There was little time, he 
realized. What he did had to be 
done fast. For when the monster 
wiped out Happy Acres, there 
would be a battalion of families 
marooned there in the woods and 
they’d come boiling out with a 
single thought in mind— to get

their hands on Homer Jackson. 

He tried to imagine what it 
might be like, and then he tried 
to stop thinking what it might 
be like, but couldn’t. 

There would be a lot of peo- 
ple there without any houses. 
They’d wake up in the wild, wet 
woods, with their furniture and 
belongings scattered all about 
them. And all those bright new 
cars would be in among the trees. 
And the people would be plenty 
sore. 

Not that he blamed them 
much. 

He was sore himself. 

That lousy Steen, he said. Like 
that contractor Gabby told about 
— the one who went out on a 
wrecking job and demolished the 
wrong house. 

r |^HE dashboard clock said 
A slightly after midnight. Elaine 
would be home by now and they 
could start right out. 

Homer turned into the drive- 
way and braked to a halt. There 
was a light in the kitchen win- 
dow. He ran up the walk and 
burst into the house. 

“Oh, there you are,” said 
Elaine. “I wondered where you 
were. What’s wrong with you?” 

“We’re getting out of here,” 
Homer babbled. 

“Have you gone stark crazy? 
Getting out!” 

“Now for once,” said Homer, 



“don’t give me an argument. 
We’re getting out of here. Tonight. 
I’ve got three sacks of money 
out there in the car—” 

“Money! How did you get 
three sacks—” 

“It’s legal,” Homer pleaded. 
“There’s nothing wrong with it. I 
didn’t rob a bank. There’s no 
time to explain. Let us just get 
going.” 

She got icy calm. “Where are 
we going, Homer?” 

“We can decide that later. 
Maybe Mexico.” 

“You’re ill,” she scolded. 
“You’ve been working too hard 
lately. And worrying about that 
Happy Acres deal—” 

It was too much for Homer. 
He turned toward the door. 

“Homer! Where are you going, 
Homer!” 

“I’ll show you the money,” he 
gritted. “I’ll show you I really 
have it.” 

“Wait for me,” she cried, but 
he didn’t wait. She ran down the 
walk behind him. 

He opened the car trunk. 
“There it is. We’ll carry it up to 
the house. You can take off your 
shoes and walk in it. Then may- 
be you’ll believe me.” 

“No, Homer, no!” 

“Here, help me with these 
sacks,” he said. 

Inside the house, he opened 
the sacks. Neatly bundled sheafs 
of bills spilled out on the floor.

Elaine knelt and picked up a 
package. 

“Why, it’s real!” she cried hap- 
pily- 

“Of course it is,” said Homer. 

“And, Homer, these are twen- 
ty-thousand-dollar bills!” . 

She dropped the package that 
she held and picked up another 
and another and another. 

“And so are these!” she 
screamed. “There are millions 
and millions here!” 

Homer was pawing desperate- 
ly through the heap of money. 
Sweat was running down his face. 



“Are they all twenty-thousand- 
dollar bills?” she asked hope- 
fully. 

“Yes,” said Homer in a beaten 
voice. 

“But what is wrong?” 

“That dirty, lowdown, bungling 
Steen,” he said bitterly. 

“But what is wrong?” she 
cried again. 

“They aren’t worth a dime,” 
said Homer. “There are no such 
things as twenty-thousand-dollar 
bills. The Treasury never issued 
any!”

FORECAST 

THE KNIGHTS OF ARTHUR, next month's novella by Frederik 
Pohl, ride into a land stranger than any predicted by Merlin or Nos- 
tradamus, with a Round Table that exists only anatomically, on a 
quest for a grail that is neither a grail nor holy, and only very in- 
cidentally and reluctantly jousting and rescuing lovely — oh, no, 
not maidens. T,he monarch they serve is one of the Most Unforgettable 
Characters in ail science fiction. With a single suitcase as his domain, 
Arthur is desperately in need of his henchmen and their arms — for 
his keys to a kingdom are typewriter keys — and they very literally 
are the keys to a kingdom! 

In Clifford D. Simak's long novelet, Duncan, like every farmer 
on every planet, has to hunt down anything that damages his crops 
— even though he is aware that this is THE WORLD THAT COULDN'T 
BE! 

Another novelet — possibly; the two lead stories are tall, broad, 
well-muscled, and need plenty of room to move around in. 

Short stories and features — of course, and Willy Ley explores 
LIFE WITHOUT GRAVITY in the most compact and exciting survey 
yet made of the untrammeled existence beyond the atmosphere that 
has scared writers silly — sillier, in many instances, than they realized. 
For there isn't as much need for speculation as you might think. We 
do have hot data and lots of it!
