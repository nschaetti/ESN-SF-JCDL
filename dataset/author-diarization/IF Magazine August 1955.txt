PREVIEW — When artist Ed Valigursky introduced his spherical 
moon shuttle-ships in the May (1954) issue, one of the scenes 
offered such unusual possibilities as a cover we asked him to do it 
in full color. The scene is that of a shuttle-ship discharging its 
cargo on the moon and it will appear on the next (October) Issue 
of IF. It Is reproduced here in black on a blue tint — but you should 
see it in full color! It's the most colorful and effective moon action 
illustration we've seen in a long, long time. Don't miss it!

FRANCHISE 

It was a frightening thing to happen to a person; the responsi- 
bility was just too great. But Norman Muller couldn’t back 
out. Multivac had chosen him, and the entire nation waited .

Illustrated by Paul Orban 



L inda, aged lO, was the only 
^one of the family who seemed 
to enjoy being awake. 

Norman Muller could hear her 
now through his own drugged, un- 
healthy coma. (He had finally 
managed to fall asleep an hour 
earlier but even then it was more 
like exhaustion than sleep.) 

She was at his bedside now, 
shaking him. “Daddy, Daddy, wake 
up. Wake up!” 

He suppressed a groan. “All 
right, Linda.” 

“But, Daddy, there’s more 
policemen around than any time! 
Police cars and everything!” 



Norman Muller gave up and rose 
blearily to his elbows. The day was 
beginning. It was faintly stirring 
toward dawn outside, the germ of 
a miserable gray that looked about 
as miserably gray as he felt. He 
could hear Sarah, his wife, shuf- 
fling about breakfast duties in the 
kitchen. His father-in-law, Mat- 
thew, was hawking strenuously in 
the bathroom. No doubt Agent 
Handley was ready and waiting for 
him. 

This was the day. 

Election day! 

To begin with, it had been like 



3 




every other year. Maybe a little 
worse, because it was a Presiden- 
tial year, but no worse than other 
Presidential years if it came to that. 

The politicians spoke about the 
guh-reat electorate and the vast 
electuh-ronic intelligence that was 
its servant. The press analyzed the 
situation with industrial computers 
(the New York Times and the St. 
Louis Post-Dispatch had their own 
computers) and were full of little 
hints as to what would be forth- 
coming. Commentators and col- 
umnists pin-pointed the crucial 
state and county in happy contra- 
diction to one another. 

The first hint that it would not 
be like every other year, was when 
Sarah Muller said to her husband 
on the evening of October 4 (with 
Election Day exactly a month off), 
“Cantwell Johnson says that In- 
diana will be the state this year. 
He’s the fourth one. Just think, 
our state this time.” 

Matthew Hortenweiler took his 
fleshy face from behind the paper, 
stared dourly at his daughter and 
growled, “Those fellows are paid 
to tell lies. Don’t listen to them.” 
“Four of them, Father,” said 
Sarah, mildly. “Tliey all say In- 
diana.” 

“Indiana is a key state, Mat- 
thew,” said Norman, just as mildly, 
“on account of the Hawkins-Smith 
Act and this mess in Indianapolis. 
It—” 

Matthew twisted his old face 
alarmingly and rasped out, “No 
one says Bloomington or Monroe 
County, do they?” 

“Well — ” said Norman. 

Linda, whose little point-chin 

4 



face had been shifting from one 
speaker to the next, said pipingly, 
“You going to be voting this year. 
Daddy?” 

Norman smiled gently and said, 
“I don’t think so, dear.” 

But this was in the gradually 
growing excitement of an October 
in a Presidential Election Year and 
Sarah had led a quiet life with 
dreams for her companions. She 
said, longingly, “Wouldn’t that be 
wonderful, though?” 

“If I voted?” Norman Muller 
had a small, blonde mustache that 
had given him a debonair quality 
in the young Sarah’s eyes, but 
which, with gradual graying, had 
declined merely to lack of dis- 
tinction. His forehead bore deepen- 
ing lines bom of uncertainty and, 
in general, he had never seduced 
his clerkly soul with the thought 
that he was either born great or 
would under any circumstances 
achieve greatness. He had a wife, 
a job and a little girl and except 
under extraordinary conditions of 
elation or depression was inclined 
to consider that to be an adequate 
bargain struck with life. 

So he was a little embarrassed 
and more than a little uneasy at 
the direction his wife’s thoughts 
were taking. “Actually, my dear,” 
he said, “there are two hundred 
million people in the country, and 
with odds like that, I don’t think 
we ought to waste our time won- 
dering about it.” 

His wife said, “Why, Norman, 
it’s no such thing like two hundred 
million and you know it. In the 
first place, only people between 20 
and 60 are eligible and it’s always 

ISAAC ASIMOV 




men, so that puts it down to may- 
be fifty million to one. Then, if it’s 
really Indiana — ” 

“Then it’s about one and a quar- 
ter million to one. You wouldn’t 
want me to bet in a horse race 
against those odds, now, would 
you? Let’s have supper.” 

Matthew muttered from behind 
his newspaper, “Damned foolish- 
ness.” 

Linda asked again, “You going 
to be voting this year, Daddy?” 
Norman shook his head and they 
all adjourned to the dining room. 

B y OCTOBER 20, Sarah’s ex- 
citement was rising rapidly. 
Over the coffee, she announced 
that Mrs. Schultz, having a cousin 
who was the secretary of an As- 
semblyman, said that all the “smart 
money” was on Indiana. 

“She says President Villers is 
even going to make a speech at 
Indianapolis.” 

Norman Muller, who had had a 
hard day at the store, nudged the 
statement with a raising of eye- 
brows and let it go at that. 

Matthew Hortenweiler, who was 
chronically dissatisfied with Wash- 
ington, said, “If Villers makes a 
speech in Indiana, that means he 
thinks Multivac will pick Arizona. 
He wouldn’t have the guts to go 
closer, the mushhead.” 

Sarah, who ignored her father 
whenever she could decently do so, 
said, “I don’t know why they don’t 
announce the state as soon as they 
can, and then the county and so 
on. Then the people who were 
eliminated could relax.” 



“If they did anything like that,” 
pointed out Norman, “the politi- 
cians would follow the announce- 
ments like vultures. By the time it 
was narrowed down to a township, 
you’d have a Congressman or two 
at every street-comer.” 

Matthew narrowed his eyes and 
brushed angrily at his sparse, gray 
hair, “They’re vultures, anyhow. 
Listen — ” 

Sarah murmured, “Now, Fa- 
ther — ” 

Matthew’s voice rumbled over 
her protest without as much as a 
stumble or hitch. “Listen, I was 
around when they set up Multivac. 
It would end partisan politics, they 
said. No more voter’s money wasted 
on campaigns. No more grinning 
nobodies high-pressured and ad- 
vertising-campaigned into Con- 
gress or the White House. So what 
happens? More campaigning than 
ever, only now they do it blind. 
They’ll send guys to Indiana on 
account of the Hawkins-Smith Act 
and other guys to California in 
case it’s the Joe Hammer situation 
that turns crucial. I say, wipe out 
all that nonsense. Back to the good, 
old—” 

Linda asked, suddenly, “Don’t 
you want Daddy to vote this year, 
Grandpa?” 

Matthew glared at the young 
girl. “Never you mind now.” He 
turned back to Norman and Sarah. 
“There was a time I voted. 
Marched right up to the polling 
booth, stuck my fist on the levers 
and voted. There was nothing to 
it. I just said: This fellow’s my 
man and I’m voting for him. 
That's the way it should be.” 



FRANCHISE

Linda said excitedly, “You voted, 
Grandpa? You really did?” 

Sarah leaned forw^ird quickly 
to quiet what might easily become 
an incongruous story drifting about 
the neighborhood. “It’s nothing, 
Linda. Grandpa doesn’t really 
mean voted. When he was a little 
boy, they had something they 
called voting. Everyone did that 
kind of voting, Grandpa, too, but 
it wasn’t really voting.” 

Matthew roared, “It wasn’t 
when I was a little boy. I was 22 
and I voted for Langley and it was 
real voting. My vote didn’t count 
for much, maybe, but it was as 
good as anyone else’s. Anyone else’s. 
And no Multi vac to — ” 

Norman interposed. “All right, 
Linda, time for bed. And stop ask- 
ing questions about voting. When 
you grow up, you’ll understand 
all about it.” 

He kissed her with antiseptic 
gentleness and she moved reluc- 
tantly out of range under maternal 
prodding and a promise that she 
might watch the bedside video till 
9:15, if she was prompt about the 
bathing ritual. 

Linda said, “Grandpa,” and 
stood with her chin down and her 
hands behind her back until his 
newspaper lowered itself to the 
point where shaggy eyebrows and 
eyes, nested in fine wrinkles, 
showed themselves. It was Friday, 
October 31. 

He said, “Yes?” 

Linda came closer and put both 
her forearms on one of the old 
man’s knees so that he had to dis- 
card his newspaper altogether. 

6 



She said, “Grandpa, did you 
really once vote?” 

He said, “You heard me say I 
did, didn’t you? Do you think I tell 
fibs?” 

“N — no, but Mamma says every- 
body voted then.” 

“So they did.” 

“But how could they? How could 
everybody vote?” 

Matthew stared at her solemnly, 
then lifted her and put her on his 
knee. 

He even moderated the tonal 
qualities of his voice. He said, “You 
see, Linda, till about forty years 
ago, everybody always voted. Say 
we wanted to decide who was to 
be the new President of the United 
States. The Democrats and Repub- 
licans would both nominate some- 
one and everybody would say who 
they wanted. When Election Day 
was over, they would count how 
many people wanted the Democrat 
and how many wanted the Repub- 
lican. Whoever had more votes 
was elected. You see?” 

Linda nodded and said, “How 
did all the people know who to 
vote for? Did Multivac tell them?” 
Matthew’s eyebrows hunched 
down and he looked severe. “They 
just used their own judgment, girl.” 
She edged away from him and 
he lowered his voice again, “I’m 
not angry at you, Linda. But, you 
see, sometimes it took all night to 
count what everyone said and peo- 
ple were impatient. So they in- 
vented special machines which 
could look at the first few votes 
and compare them with the votes 
from the same places in previous 
years. That way the machine could 

ISAAC ASIMOV 




compute how the total vote would 
be and who would be elected. You 
see?” 

She nodded. “Like Multivac.” 
“The first computers were much 
smaller than Multivac. But the 
machines grew bigger and they 
could tell how the election would 
go from fewer and fewer votes. 
Then, at last, they built Multivac 
and it can tell from just one voter.” 
Linda smiled at having reached 
a familiar part of the story and 
said, “That’s nice.” 

Matthew frowned and said, “No, 
it’s not nice. I don’t want a ma- 
chine telling me how I would have 
voted just because some joker in 
Milwaukee says he’s against higher 
tariffs. Maybe I want to vote 
cockeyed just for the pleasure of 
it. Maybe I don’t want to vote. 
Maybe — ” 

But Linda had wriggled from his 
knee and was beating a retreat. 

She met her mother at the door. 
Her mother, who was still wearing 
her coat and had not even had 
time to remove her hat, said 
breathlessly, “Run along, Linda. 
Don’t get in mother’s way.” 

Then she said to Matthew as 
she lifted her hat from her head 
and patted her hair back into 
place, “I’ve been at Agatha’s.” 
Matthew stared at her censo- 
riously and did not even dignify 
that piece of information with a 
grunt as he groped for his news- 
paper. 

Sarah said, as she unbuttoned her 
coat, “Guess what she said?” 
Matthew flattened out his news- 
paper for reading purposes with a 
sharp crackle and said, “Don’t 

FRANCHISE 



much care.” 

Sarah said, “Now, Father — ” 
But she had no time for anger. 
The news had to be told and Mat- 
thew was the only recipient handy. 
So she went on, “Agatha’s Joe is 
a policeman, you know, and he 
says a whole truckload of secret 
service men came into Blooming- 
ton last night.” 

“They’re not after me.” 

“Don’t you see. Father? Secret 
service agents, and it’s almost elec- 
tion time. In Bloomington!’^ 

“Maybe they’re after a bank 
robber.” 

“There hasn’t been a bank rob- 
bery in town in ages . Father, 
you’re hopeless.” 

She stalked away. 

Nor did Norman Muller receive 
the news with noticeably greater 
excitement. 

“Now, Sarah, how did Agatha’s 
Joe know they were secret service 
agents,” he asked, calmly. “They 
wouldn’t go around with identi- 
fication cards pasted on their fore- 
heads.” 

But by next evening, with No- 
vember a day old, she could say 
triumphantly, “It’s just everyone 
in Bloomington that’s waiting for 
someone local to be the voter. The 
Bloomington News as much as said 
so on video.” 

Norman stirred uneasily. He 
couldn’t deny it, and his heart was 
sinking. If Bloomington was really 
to be hit by Multivac’s lightning, it 
would mean newspapermen, video 
shows, tourists, all sorts of — strange 
upset. Norman liked the quiet rou- 
tine of his life and the distant stir 

7 




of politics was getting uncomfort- 
ably close. 

He said, “It*s all rumor. Nothing 
more.” 

“You wait and see, then. You 
just wait and see.” 

As things turned out, there was 
very little time to wait, for the 
door-bell rang insistently, and when 
Norman Muller opened it and 
said, “Yes?” a tall, grave-faced 
man said, “Are you Norman Mul- 
ler?” 

Norman said, “Yes” again, but 
in a strange dying voice. It was 
not difficult to see from the stran- 
ger’s bearing that he was one car- 
rying authority and the nature of 
his errand suddenly became as in- 
evitably obvious as it had, until the 
moment before, been unthinkably 
impossible. 

The man presented credentials, 
stepped into the house, closed the 
door behind him and said ritualis- 
tically, “Mr. Norman Muller, it 
is necessary for me to inform you 
on the behalf of the President of 
the United States that you have 
been chosen to represent the 
American electorate on Tuesday, 
November 4, 2008.” 



N orman MULLER managed, 
with difficulty, to walk un- 
aided to his chair. He sat there, 
white-faced and almost insensible, 
while Sarah brought water, slapped 
his hands in panic and moaned to 
her husband between clenched 
teeth, “Don’t be sick, Norman. 
DonH be sick. They’ll pick some- 
one else.” 

When Norman could manage to 

8 



talk, he whispered, “I’m sorry, 
sir. 

The secret service agent had re- 
moved his coat, unbuttoned his 
jacket and was sitting at esise on 
the couch. 

“It’s all right,” he said, and the 
mark of officialdom seemed to have 
vanished with the formal an- 
nouncement and leave him simply 
a large and rather friendly man. 
“This is the sixth time I’ve made 
the announcement and I’ve seen 
all kinds of reactions. Not one of 
them was the kind you see on the 
video. You know what I mean? A 
holy, dedicated look, and a charac- 
ter who says: Tt will be a great 
privilege to serve my country.’ 
That sort of stuff.” The agent 
laughed comfortingly. 

Sarah’s accompanying laugh 
held a trace of shrill hysteria. 

The agent said, “Now you’re go- 
ing to have me with you for a 
while. My name is Phil Handley. 
I’d appreciate it if you call me 
Phil. Mr. Muller can’t leave the 
house any more till Election Day. 
You’ll have to inform the depart- 
ment store that he’s sick, Mrs. Mul- 
ler. You can go about your busi- 
ness for a while but you’ll have to 
agree not to say a word about this. 
Right, Mrs. Muller?” 

Sarah nodded vigorously. “No, 
sir. Not a word.” 

“All right. But, Mrs. Muller,” 
Handley looked grave, “we’re not 
kidding now. Go out only if you 
must and you’ll be followed when 
you do. I’m sorry but that’s the 
way we must operate.” 

“Followed?” 

“It won’t be obvious. Don’t wor- 
ISAAC ASIMOV 




ry. And it’s only for two days till 
the formal announcement to the 
nation is made. Your daughter — ” 

“She’s in bed,” said Sarah, 
hastily. 

“Good. She’ll have to be told I’m 
a relative or friend staying with 
the family. If she does find out the 
truth, she’ll have to be kept in 
the house. Your father had better 
stay in tlfe house in any case.” 

“He won’t like that,” said Sarah. 

“Can’t be helped. Now, since 
you have no odiers living with 
you — ” 

“You know all about us, ap- 
parently,” whispered Norman. 

“Quite a bit,” agreed Handley. 
“In any case, those are all my in- 
structions to you for the moment. 
I’ll try to co-operate as much as 
I can and be as little of a nuisance 
as possible. The government will 
pay for my maintenance so I won’t 
be an expense to you. I’ll be re- 
lieved each night by someone who 
will sit up in this room, so there 
will be no problem about sleeping 
accommodations. Now, Mr. Mul- 
ler—” 

“Sir?” 

“You can call me Phil,” said 
the agent again. “The purpose of 
the two days preliminary to formal 
announcement is to get you used 
to your position. We prefer to have 
you face Multivac in as normal a 
state of mind as possible. Just re- 
lax and try to feel this is all in a 
day’s work. Okay?” 

“Okay,” said Norman, and then 
shook his head violently. “But I 
don’t want the responsibility. Why 
me?” 

“All right,” said Handley, “let’s 
FRANCHISE 



get that straight to begin with. 
Multivac weighs all sorts of known 
factors, billions of them. One factor 
isn’t known, though, and won’t be 
known for a long time. That’s the 
reaction pattern of the human 
mind. All Americans are subjected 
to molding pressure of what other 
Americans do and say, to the things 
that are done to him and the things 
he does to others. Any American 
can be brought to Multivac to 
have the bent of his mind surveyed. 
From that the bent of all other 
minds in the country can be esti- 
mated. Some Americans are better 
for the purpose than others at some 
given time, depending upon the 
happenings of diat year. Multivac 
picked you as most representative 
this year. Not the smartest, or the 
strongest, or the luckiest, but just 
the most representative. Now we 
don’t question Multivac, do we?” 

“Couldn’t it make a mistake?” 
asked Norman. 

Sarah, who listened impatiently, 
interrupted to say, “Don’t listen to 
him, sir. He’s just nervous, you 
know. Actually, he’s very well-read 
and he always follows politics very 
closely.” 

Handley said, “Multivac makes 
the decisions, Mrs. Muller. It 
picked your husband.” 

“But does it know everything?” 
insisted Norman, wildly. “Can’t it 
have made a mistake?” 

“Yes, it can. There’s no point in 
not being frank. In 1993, a selected 
Voter died of a stroke two hours 
before it was time for him to be 
notified. Multivac didn’t predict 
that; it couldn’t. A Voter might 
be mentally unstable, morally un- 

9 




suitable, or, for that matter, dis- 
loyal. Multivac can’t know every- 
thing about everybody until he’s 
fed all the data there is. That’s why 
alternate selections are always held 
in readiness. I don’t think we’ll be 
using one this time. You’re in good 
health, Mr. Muller, and you’ve 
been carefully* investigated. You 
qualify.” 

Norman buried his face in his 
hands and sat motionless, 

“By tomorrow morning, sir,” said 
Sarah, “he’ll be perfectly all right. 
He just has to get used to it, that’s 
all.” 

“Of course,” said Handley. 

In the privacy of their bed- 
chamber, Sarah Muller expressed 
herself in stronger fashion. The 
burden of her lecture was, “So get 
hold of yourself, Norman. You’re 
trying to throw away the chance 
of a lifetime.” 

Norman whispered, desperately, 
“It frightens me, Sarah. The whole 
thing.” 

“For goodness sake, why? What’s 
there to it but answering a question 
or two?” 

“The responsibility is too great. 
I couldn’t face it.” 

“What responsibility? There 
isn’t any. Multivac picked you. It’s 
Multivac’s responsibility. Everyone 
knows that.” 

Norman sat up in bed in a sud- 
den access of rebellion and anguish. 
“Everyone is supposed to know 
that. But they don’t. They — ” 

“Lower your voice,” hissed 
Sarah, icily. “They’ll hear you 
downtown.” 

“They don’t,” said Norman, de- 



clining quickly to a whisper. “ When 
they talk about the Ridgely ad- 
ministration of 1988, do they say 
that Ridgely was corrupt and the 
nation was foolish to elect him? 
Do they say he won them over with 
pie-in-the-sky promises and racist 
baloney? No! They talk about the 
‘goddam MacComber vote’ as 
though Humphrey MacComber 
was the only man who had any- 
thing to do with it because he 
faced Multivac. I’ve said it my- 
self — only now I think, the poor 
guy was just a truck-farmer who 
didn’t ask to be picked. Why was 
it his fault more than anyone else’s. 
Now his name is a curse.” 

“You’re just being childish,” 
said Sarah. 

“I’m being sensible. I tell you, 
Sarah, I won’t accept. They can’t 
make me vote if I don’t want to. 
I’ll say I’m sick. I’ll say—” 

But Sarah had had enough. 
“Now you listen to me,” she whis- 
pered in a cold fury. “You don’t 
have only yourself to think about. 
You know what it means to be 
Voter of the Year. A Presidential 
year at that. It means publicity and 
fame and, maybe, buckets of 
money — ” 

“And then I go back to being 
a clerk.” 

“You will not. You’ll have a 
branch managership at the least 
if you have any brains at all, and 
you will have, because I’ll tell you 
what to do. You control the kind 
of publicity if you play your cards 
right, and you can force Kennell 
Stores, Inc. into a tight contract 
and an escalator clause in connec- 
tion with your salary and z, decent 



10 



ISAAC ASIMOV 




pension plan.” 

“That’s not the point in being 
Voter, Sarah.” 

“That will be your point. If you 
don’t owe anything to yourself or 
to me — I’m not asking for myself 
— ^you owe something to Linda.” 

Norman groaned. 

“Well, don’t you?” snapped 
Sarah. 

“Yes, dear,” murmured Norman. 

On November 3, the official an- 
nouncement was made and it was 
too late for Norman to back out 
even if he had been able to find 
the courage to make the attempt. 

Their house was sealed off. Se- 
cret service agents made their ap- 
pearance in the open, blocking off 
all approach. 

At first the telephone rang in- 
cessantly, but Philip Handley with 
an engagingly apologetic smile took 
all calls. Eventually, the exchange 
shunted all calls directly to the po- 
lice station. 

Noiman imagined that in that 
way, he was spared not only the 
bubbling (and envious?) congratu- 
lations of friends, but also the egre- 
gious pressure of salesmen scenting 
a prospect and the designing 
smoothness of politicians from all 
over the nation. Perhaps even 
death threats from the inevitable 
cranks. 

Newspapers were forbidden to 
the house now in order to keep out 
weighted pressure and television 
was gently but firmly disconnected, 
over Linda’s loud protests. 

Matthew growled and stayed in 
his room; Linda, after the first 
flurry of excitement, sulked and 

FRANCHISE 



whined because she could not leave 
the house; Sarah divided her time 
between preparation of meals for 
the present and plans for the fu- 
ture; and Norman’s depression 
lived and fed upon itself. 

And the morning of Tuesday, 
November 4, 2008, came at last 
and it was Election Day. 

r r WAS EARLY breakfast, but 
only Norman Muller ate, and 
that mechanically. Even a shower 
and shave had not succeeded in 
either restoring him to reality or 
removing his own conviction that 
he was as grimy without as he 
felt grimy within. 

Handley’s friendly voice did its 
best to shed some normality over 
the gray and unfriendly dawn. 
(The weather prediction had been 
for a cloudy day with prospects 
of rain before noon.) 

Handley said, “We’ll keep this 
house insulated till Mr. Muller is 
back, but after that we’ll be off 
your necks.” The secret service 
agent was in full uniform now, in- 
cluding side-aums in heavily- 
brassed holsters. 

“You’ve been no trouble at all, 
Mr. Handley,” simpered Sarah. 

Norman drank through two cups 
of black coffee, wiped his lips with 
a napkin, stood up and said, hag- 
gardly, “I’m ready.” 

Handley stood up, too, “Very 
well, sir. And thank you, Mrs. 
Muller, for your very kind hos- 
pitality.” 

The armored car purred down 
empty streets. They were empty 

n 




even for that hour of the morning. 

Handley indicated that and said, 
“They always shift traffic away 
from the line of drive ever since 
the attempted bombing that nearly 
ruined the Leverett election of 
’ 92 .” 

When the car stopped, Norman 
was helped oiit by the always 
polite Handley into an under- 
ground drive whose walls were lined 
with soldiers at attention. 

He was led into a brightly lit 
room, in which three white-uni- 
formed men greeted him smilingly. 

Norman said, sharply, “But this 
is the hospital?” 

“There’s no significance to that,” 
said Handley, at once. “It’s just 
that the hospital has the necessary 
facilities.” 

“Well, what do I do?” 

Handley nodded. One of the 
three men in white advanced and 
said, “I’ll take over now, agent.” 

Handley saluted in an ofT-hand 
manner and left the room. 

The man in white said, “Won’t 
you sit down, Mr. Muller? I’m 
John Paulson, Senior Computer. 
These are Samson Levine and Peter 
Dorogobuzh, my assistants.” 

Norman numbly shook hands all 
around. Paulson was a man of mid- 
dle height with a soft face that 
seemed used to smiling and a very 
obvious toupee. He wore plastic- 
rimmed glasses of an old-fashioned 
cut, and he lit a cigarette as he 
talked. (Norman refused his offer 
of one.) 

Paulson said, “In the first place, 
Mr. Muller, I want you to know 
we are in no hurry. We want you 
to stay with us all day if necessary, 

12 



just so that you get used to your 
surroundings and get over any 
thought you might have that there 
is anything unusual in this, any- 
thing clinical, if you know what I 
mean.” 

“It’s all right,” said Norman. 
“I’d just as soon this were over.” 

“I understand your feelings. Still, 
we want you to know exactly what’s 
going on. In the first place, Mul- 
tivac isn’t here.” 

“It isn’t?” Somehow through all 
his depression, he had still looked 
forward to seeing Multivac. They 
said it was half a mile long and 
three stories high, that fifty tech- 
nicians walked the corridors within 
its structure continuously. It was 
one of the wonders of the world. 

Paulson smiled. “No. It’s not 
portable, you know. It’s located un- 
derground, in fact, and very few 
people know exactly where. You 
can understand that, since it is our 
greatest natural resource. Believe 
me, elections aren’t the only thing 
it’s used for.” 

Norman thought he was being 
deliberately chatty, but found him- 
self intrigued all the same. “I 
thought I’d see it. I’d like to.” 

“I’m sure of that. But it takes a 
Presidential order and even then 
it has to be countersigned by Se- 
curity. However, we are plugged 
into Multivac right here by beam 
transmission. What Multivac says 
can be interpreted here and what 
we say is beamed directly to Mul- 
tivac, so in a sense we’re in its 
presence.” 

Norman looked about. The ma- 
chines within the room were all 
meaningless to him.

“Now let me explain, Mr. Mul- 
ler,” Paulson went on. “Multivac 
already has most of the information 
it needs to decide all the elections, 
national, state and local. It needs 
only to check certain imponderable 
attitudes of mind and it will use 
you for that. We can’t predict what 
questions it will ask, but they may 
not make much sense to you, or 
even to us. It may ask you how you 
feel about garbage-disposal in your 
town; whether you favor central 
incinerators. It might ask you 
whether you have a doctor of your 
own or whether you make use of 
National Medicine, Inc. Do you 
understand?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Whatever it asks, you answer 
in your own words in any way you 
please. If you feel you must explain 
quite a bit, do so. Talk an hour, if 
necessary.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Now, one more thing. We will 
have to make use of some simple 
devices which will automatically 
record your blood pressure, heart 
beat, slan conductivity and brain 
wave pattern while you speak. The 
machinery will seem formidable, 
but it’s all absolutely painless. You 
won’t even know it’s going on. So 
don’t worry about it.” 

The other two technicians were 
already busying themselves with 
smooth-gleaming apparatus on 
oiled wheels. 

Norman said, “Is that to check 
on whether I’m lying or not?” 

“Not at all, Mr. Muller. There’s 
no question of lying. It’s only a 
matter of emotional intensity. If 
the machine asks you your opinion 

FRANCHISE 



of your child’s school, you may say, 
T think it is overcrowded.’ Those 
are only words. From the way your 
brain and heart and hormones and 
sweat glands work, Multivac can 
judge exactly how intensely you 
feel about the matter. It will un- 
derstand your feelings better than 
you yourself.” 

“I never heard of this,” said 
Norman. 

“No, I’m sure you didn’t. Most 
of the details of Multivac’s work- 
ings are top secret. For instance, 
when you leave, you will be asked 
to sign a paper swearing that you 
will never reveal the nature of the 
questions you were asked, the na- 
ture of your responses, what was 
done, or how it was done. The less 
is known about the Multivac, the 
less chance of attempted outside 
pressures upon the men who serv- 
ice it.” He smiled, grimly, “Our 
lives are hard enough as it is.” 
Norman nodded. “I under- 
stand.” 

“And now would you like any- 
thing to eat or drink?” 

“No. Nothing right now.” 

“Do you have any questions?” 
Norman shook his head. 

“Then you tell us when you’re 
ready.” 

“I’m ready right now.” 

“You’re certain there’s nothing 
else you want to ask?” 

“Quite.” 

Paulson nodded, and raised his 
hand in a gesture to the others. 

They advanced with their fright- 
ening equipment and Norman 
Muller felt his breath come a little 
more quickly and his heart beat 
more rapidly as he watched. 

13 




T he ordeal lasted nearly 
three hours, with one short 
break for coffee and an embarrass- 
ing session with a chamber-pot. 
During all this time, Norman Mul- 
ler remained encased in machinery. 
He was bone- weary at the close. 

He thought sardonically that his 
promise to reveal nothing of what 
had passed would be an easy one 
to keep. Already the questions were 
a hazy mish-mash in his mind. 

Somehow he had thought Mul- 
tivac would speak in a sepulchral, 
superhuman voice, resonant and 
echoing, but that, he now decided, 
was just an idea he had from see- 
ing too many television shows. The 
truth was distressingly undramatic. 
The questions were slips of a kind 
of metallic foil patterned with nu- 
merous punctures. A second ma- 
chine converted the pattern into 
words and Paulson read the words 
to Norman, then gave him the 
question and let him read it for 
himself. 

Norman’s answers were taken 
down by a recording machine, 
played back to Norman for con- 
firmation, with emendations and 
added remarks also taken down. 
All that was fed into a pattern- 
making instrument and that, in 
turn, was radiated to Multivac. 

The one question Norman could 
remember at the moment was an 
incongruously gossipy: “What do 
you think of the price of eggs?” 
He had answered, blankly, “I 
don’t know the price of eggs.” 
Now it was over, and gently they 
removed the electrodes from vari- 
ous portions of his body, un- 
wrapped the pulsating band from 

14 



his upper arm, moved the machin- 
ery away. 

He stood up, drew a deep, shud- 
dering breath and said, “Is that 
all? Am I through?” 

“Not quite,” Paulson hurried to 
him, smiling in reassuring fashion. 
“We’ll have to ask you to stay 
another hour.” 

“Why?” asked Norman, sharply. 
“It will take that long for Mul- 
tivac to weave the new data into 
the trillions of items it has. Thou- 
sands of elections are concerned, 
you know. It’s very complicated. 
And it may be that an odd contest 
here or there, a comptrollership in 
Phoenix, Arizona, or some council 
seat in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, 
may be in doubt. In that case, 
Multivac may be compelled to ask 
you a deciding question or two.” 
“No,” said Norman. “I won’t go 
through this again.” 

“It probably won’t happen,” 
Paulson said, soothingly. “It rarely 
does. But just in case, you’ll have 
to stay.” A touch of steel, just a 
touch, entered his voice. “You have 
no choice, you know. You must.” 
Norman sat down wearily. He 
shrugged. 

Paulson said, “We can’t let you 
read a newspaper, but if you’d care 
for a murder mystery, or if you’d 
like to play chess, or if there’s any- 
thing we can do for you to help 
pass the time, I wish you’d men- 
tion it.” 

“It’s all right. I’ll just wait.” 
They ushered him into a small 
room just next to the one in which 
he had been questioned. He let 
himself sink into a plastic covered 
armchair and closed his eyes. 

ISAAC ASIMOV 




As well as he could, he must 
wait out this final hour. 

He sat perfectly still and slowly 
the tension left him. His breathing 
grew less ragged and he could clasp 
his hands without being quite so 
conscious of the trembling of his 
fingers. 

Maybe there would be no ques- 
tions. Maybe it was all over. 

If it were over, then the next 
thing would be torchlight proces- 
sions and invitations to speak at 
all sorts of functions. The Voter 
of the Year! 

He, Norman Muller, ordinary 
clerk of a small department store in 
Bloomington, Indiana, who had 
neither been bom great nor 
achieved greatness would be in 
the extraordinary position of hav- 
ing had greatness thrust upon him. 

The historians would speak 
soberly of the Muller Election of 
2008. That would be its name, the 
Muller Election! 

The publicity, the better job, 
the flash flood of money that in- 
terested Sarah so much, occupied 
only a corner of his mind. It would 
all be welcome, of course. He 
couldn’t refuse it. But at the mo- 
ment something else was begin- 
ning to concern him. 

A latent patriotism was stirring. 
After all, he was representing the 
entire electorate. He was the focal 



point for them. He was, in his own 
person, for this one day, all of 
America! 

The door opened, snapping him 
to open-eyed attention. For a mo- 
ment, his stomach constricted. Not 
more questions! 

But Paulson was smiling. “That 
will be all, Mr. Muller.” 

“No more questions, sir?” 

“None needed. Everything was 
quite clearcut. You will be es- 
corted back to your home and then 
you will be a private citizen once 
more. Or as much so as the public 
will allow.” 

“Thank you. Thank you.” Nor- 
man flushed and said, “I wonder 
— Who was elected?” 

Paulson shook his head. “That 
will have to wait for the official 
announcement. The rules are quite 
strict. We can’t even tell you. You 
understand.” 

“Of course. Yes.” Norman felt 
embarrassed. 

“Secret Service will have the 
necessary papers for you to sign.” 

“Yes.” Suddenly, Norman Mul- 
ler felt proud. It was on him now 
in full strength. He was proud. 

In this imperfect world, the 
sovereign citizens of the first and 
greatest Electronic Democracy had, 
through Norman Muller (through 
him! ) exercised once again its free, 
untrammeled franchise. • • •

BIRTHRIGHT 



Why was Cyril Kirk, highest man in his class, assigned to such 
an enigmatic place as Nemar? Of what value was it — if any- 



thing? No one could tell him 
believed them . 



BY APRI 



C YRIL KIRK’S first sight of the 
planet from the spaceship did 
nothing to abate the anger seething 
within him. He stared at it in dis- 
gust, glad there were no other pas- 
sengers left to witness his arrival. 

All during the long trip, he had 
felt their curious stares and excited 
whispers everywhere he passed, and 
he had felt a small wave of relief 
whenever a large batch of them 



the answer. He wouldnt have 



L SMITH 



had been unloaded on some planet 
along the way. None of them had 
come this far — which was hardly 
surprising, he thought; the last of 
them had been taken off two-thirds 
of the way to Nemar. He was very 
glad to see them go, though by that 
time they had stopped making their 
cautious, deferential attempts to 
draw him into conversation and 
elicit some clue about his mission 



16

and destination. 

He had let them wonder. He 
knew that his aloofness was being 
taken as snobbishness, but he was 
past caring. They all recognized 
that he was a Planetary Adminis- 
trator by the blazing gold insignia 
on the dark uniform, insignia call- 
ing for awe and respect all over the 
galaxy. They guessed that this was 
his first appointment, but the thing 
that really aroused their curiosity 
was the bitter, angry look that went 
with what they considered his ar- 
rogant reserve. 

Since polite efforts at conversa- 
tion by the braver or more confi- 
dent among the company were met 
with icy monosyllables that cut off 
further attempts, they were left 
with a wide range of controversy. 
Some of them held, though they 
had never actually seen a Planetary 
Administrator before in the flesh, 
that all PA’s were like this. They 
argued that the long, grueling years 
of study, the ascetic,- disciplined life 
from childhood, and the constant 
pressure of competition, knowing 
that only a small percentage would 
finally make the grade, made them 
kind of inhuman by the time they 
finished. Besides, they were near- 
geniuses or they wouldn’t have 
been selected in the first place — 
and everybody knows geniuses are 
sort of peculiar. 

One of the bolder and more 
beautiful girls on board had been 
argued into making a carefully 
planned attempt to draw informa- 
tion out of him, and bets had been 
placed on the results. She was eager 
enough to try her hand at this rich 
prize, and her self-confidence was 

18 



justified by a long trail of broken 
hearts in high places, but the at- 
tempt came to nothing. Kirk was 
aware of her efforts and aware that 
in another mood he would have 
appreciated her charm, but he felt 
too sick and miserable to respond. 

Remembering her piquant, 
laughing face later in his cabin, 
Kirk thought morosely of the long 
train of girls he had known in the 
past. Many of them had been love- 
ly — a fledgling PA was considered 
a highly desirable date, even 
though the chances were always 
that he wouldn’t make it in the 
end. But Kirk had always been 
filled with an iron determination 
that he was going to make it in the 
end, and this meant no distractions. 
If he began to feel he might get 
really emotionally entangled with a 
girl, he stopped seeing her at once. 
He saw them seldom enough, any- 
way. The regulations of the PA In- 
stitute gave him a fair amount of 
free time, but the study require- 
ments made the apparent freedom 
meaningless. 

How hard he’d worked for the 
day he’d be wearing this uniform, 
he thought bitterly. How proud 
and happy he’d thought he’d feel 
wearing it! And now, instead, here 
he was, practically hiding in his 
cabin, hoping nobody would dis- 
cover the name of his destination 
and guess the reason for the humil- 
iated rage that was still coursing 
through him. 

He’d gone over the interview with 
Carlin Ross a hundred times since 
the trip started, and he wasn’t any 
nearer to making sense out of it 
than when he began . 

APRIL SMITH 




He’d entered Ross’s office for the 
interview in which he would be 
awarded his post, full of confidence 
and pride. The final examination 
results posted in the main lobby 
were headed by his name. He knew 
that, because of his good record and 
general popularity, he had been 
watched with special interest by the 
teachers and staff for some time; 
and he looked forward to being 
awarded a particularly desirable 
planet, in spite of its being his first 
post. 

Technical ability and sound 
training in administration had long 
ago been decided upon as more im- 
portant than practical experience, 
as mankind began to sicken of the 
bungling of political appointees. 
The far-flung planets that had been 
colonized or held an intelligent, 
humanoid population were so nu- 
merous that even an experienced 
Planetary Administrator could 
know very little about each one. 
Only someone brought up on a 
planet could have a detailed knowl- 
edge of it, and it was a basic prem- 
ise of the Galactic Union that 
governors with a common upbring- 
ing and training on Terra were 
necessary to keep the varied parts 
of the empire from splitting off and 
becoming alienated from the rest. 

Ross was one of the half-dozen 
men in the top echelon governing 
the galaxy and its warring com- 
ponents. His official title was Ga- 
lactic Coordinator, and one of his 
minor duties was the supervision 
of the Institute of Training for 
Planetary Administration, which 
had been home to Kirk for so long. 
Although he was the Institute’s 

BIRTHRIGHT 



official head, he was too busy to be 
seen in its halls more than rarely, 
but Kirk had had several brief talks 
with him and one long one. He had 
the feeling that Ross had a special 
interest in him, and this had added 
to his anticipation on the fatal day. 

As he entered the room, Ross 
looked up, his blue eyes friendly 
and alert in the weathered, tanned 
face. “Hello, Kirk,” he said. As al- 
ways, the simple warmth of his 
smile threw Kirk off guard. It had 
never failed to surprise him the few 
times he had seen Ross. In this 
place of dedicated, serious men, of 
military crispness of speech, of stiff- 
ly erect carriage, Ross’s relaxed 
body and quiet, open expression 
seemed startlingly out of place. Ex- 
cept for the alertness and intelli- 
gence of the eyes, he looked like a 
country farmer who had wandered 
in by mistake. Kirk, and his friends, 
had more than once wondered how 
such an anomaly had risen to the 
high position of Galactic Coordi- 
nator. 

However, if his manner left you 
puzzled, it also made you feel sur- 
prisingly comfortable, and Kirk had 
felt relaxed and happy as Ross mo- 
tioned him to a chair. Nothing pre- 
pared him for the shock that was to 
come. 

He remembered the apparent 
casualness with which Ross had 
spoken. “I’m sending you to Ne- 
mar.” 

For a moment Kirk felt blank. 
The name did not register. His 
private speculations had centered 
on the question of whether he 
would be sent to a thriving, pleas- 
ant, habitable planet or to one of 

19 




those whose bleak surface contained 
some newly discovered, highly val- 
uable mineral and whose struggling 
colonists lived under pressurized 
domes. Either type could have held 
the chance to work up to the ga- 
lactic eminence and power he had 
set his heart on. He had been over 
and over the list of planets that 
were due to receive new PA’s 
(there was a rotational system of 
five years, with an additional five 
years made optional), and he had a 
private list of those which, as the 
star graduate of his class, he hoped 
he might draw. Nemar was not 
among them. 

His face stayed blank for a min- 
ute as he searched his memory for 
the name, and as vague bits of in- 
formation filtered through to him, 
his eyes widened in disbelief. “But, 
sir — ” He fumbled for words. 
“That’s on the very edge of the 
galaxy.” 

Ross’s voice was quiet. “Yes, it’s 
a long way.” 

“But there’s nothing on it!” 

Ross sounded a little amused. 
“There are some very nice people 
on it — the natives are of the same 
species as we are, though they look 
a little different. That means the 
air is breathable without aids. It’s 
quite a pleasant planet.” 

“That’s not what I mean, sir. I 
mean there’s nothing of any value 
— no minerals, no artifacts, no val- 
uable plant or animal products.” 
He searched his memory for what 
little he could remember about Ne- 
mar from classes. He recalled that 
the planet had been discovered only 
forty years ago by a Survey ship 
that had gone off course far toward 



the outer rim of the galaxy. It had 
been incorporated into the Galactic 
Union because it was considered 
dangerous to leave any inhabited 
planet free of control; but it had 
not been considered a valuable ad- 
dition. It was far off the established 
trade routes, and seemed to contain 
nothing worth the expense of trans- 
porting it. “The culture is very 
primitive, isn’t it?” Kirk asked, half 
thinking aloud. 

“It is so considered,” Ross an- 
swered. 

The reply struck Kirk as odd. 
A sudden hope filled him. Maybe 
something new had been discov- 
ered about the place, possibly some- 
thing that only Ross and a few of 
the top command knew about. He 
threw a sharp glance at Ross’s face, 
but it told him nothing. “I don’t 
remember too much about the place 
from class,” he ventured. 

Ross rose, and with his incon- 
gruously quick, lazy grace strode to 
the filing cabinet along the wall, 
pulling out documents and pam- 
phlets. He plumped them in a pile 
in front of Kirk. “Most of the 
factual information we have is in 
these. You can try the library, too, 
but I doubt if you’ll find anything 
more.” He added a book to the 
pile. “This covers their language. 
You’ll have two months of intensive 
instruction in it before you go. You 
were always good in your language 
structure courses, so I doubt that 
you’ll have any trouble with it. 
You’ll have another two weeks to 
learn the stuff in these documents, 
and two more weeks to rest or do 
whatever you like before you leave.” 
He resumed his chair. “You’re luck-

ier than some of the others. The 
boy who got Proserpine will have 
a stack of books up to there to 
absorb.” He gestured toward the 
ceiling. 

At the mention of Proserpine, 
Kirk’s brown eyes darkened. Proser- 
pine had been recently discovered, 
too, but that was all it had in com- 
mon with Nemar. Its inhospitable 
surface held vast amounts of a 
highly valuable fuel ore, and it had 
been one of the places on his list. 
He wondered who was going there, 
his insides suddenly twisting with 
envy. He tried to keep his voice 
even. “I don’t understand why I’m 
being sent to Nemar.” He searched 
for words. After all, he couldn’t 
exactly mention his graduating first 
and his record. “Is there something 
I don’t know about? Has some- 
thing valuable been discovered that 
hasn’t been publicized, or — ” He 
waited hopefully. 

Ross’s answer was flat. “No, 
there’s nothing there that can be 
transported that’s worth transport- 
ing.” 

Kirk felt despair surging through 
him, then suddenly changing to 
sharp anger. “I’ve worked hard. I 
have a good record. Why are you 
giving me this — this lemon? Why 
don’t you give it to whoever gradu- 
ated lowest, or better still to some 
older PA who bungled things some- 
where, but not quite enough to be 
retired!” His face was burning with 
rage. Somewhere inside he felt 
shocked at himself for speaking to 
a Coordinator this way ; at the same 
time he felt a violent urge to carry 
it farther and sock Ross in the nose. 
His body was shaking . 

birthright 



Remembering the scene now as 
he watched Nemar swing closer, 
Kirk felt the anger again, time 
hadn’t dimmed it at all. Ross must 
have perceived his fury, but he had 
shown no signs of it. Looking as 
friendly as ever, he had told him 
mildly that he did not consider 
Nemar a “lemon”, that he had ex- 
cellent reasons for sending him 
there, but he preferred not to tell 
him what they were. He wanted 
him to discover them for himself 
after he arrived. The rest of the 
interview had concerned itself 
mainly with practical information, 
most of which Kirk had scarcely 
heard through his fog of emotion. 

His endless speculations since 
then had gotten him nowhere. He 
had dredged out of his memory 
every incident that might reveal 
some trait for which he was being 
discreetly given a back seat. He re- 
called a roommate who had said he 
was going to become a living ma- 
chine if he kept it up, and no 
machine had the right to have ju- 
risdiction over people. But Jere had 
flunked out along the way, like 
most candidates who had an atti- 
tude like that. He went over the 
time he had been called to Ross’s 
office and gently rebuked for work- 
ing men under him on a project too 
hard. “I don’t ask anything from 
them I don’t ask of myself,” he 
had protested. 

“I know,” Ross had answered, 
“and I respect that. But you work 
that hard from choice.” Then he 
had nodded in dismissal. 

Kirk had puzzled over these and 
other incidents, searching for a clue, 
but found nothing. All his probing 

21 




in a more optimistic direction led to 
blind alleys also. The documents 
on Nemar, all the information he 
could dig up, confirmed Ross’s 
statement that the planet held 
nothing of commercial value. 

The planet, to judge by what he 
had read, was a pleasant place, ap- 
parently very pretty, with heavy 
vegetation and a warm, temperate 
climate, and the natives were hos- 
pitable and friendly. But all this 
held very little comfort for him and 
did little to assuage the sense of 
angry humiliation that had made 
him seek isolation from the other 
passengers. 

He could see the planet more 
clearly now as the ship began to 
angle into an orbit, preparatory to 
sending out the smaller landing 
ship which would take him down. 
Hastily he reviewed in his mind 
once more the few facts he knew 
about the place, and shaped his 
tongue to the unfamiliar sounds of 
the native language. He fought 
down the feeling of humiliation, 
and straightened his shoulders. Aft- 
er all, to these people, he would 
he the most important person on the 
planet. If he was to be a big frog 
in a small puddle, he was still su- 
preme administrator here, and he 
had no intention of letting them 
know his arrival signified a disgrace 
to him. 



ROM THE airlock of the land- 
ing ship, Kirk looked out on a 
cleared plain. In the foreground 
a group of natives were gathered 
to greet him, and a scattering of 
dark uniforms among them indi- 



cated the officials who would make 
up the Terran part of his staff. As 
the natives approached him, he 
noted the green-gold hair and the 
slightly greenish tinge to their skin, 
for which his studies had prepared 
him. 

Nothing in his studies, however, 
had prepared him for the extraor- 
dinary grace and beauty of these 
people. 

They were dressed, men and 
women alike, in a simple fold of 
bright-colored cloth circling their 
body from the waist and reaching 
a third of the way to their knees. 
Kirk noted, with a slight sense of 
shock, that the women wore noth- 
ing above the waist except for a 
strand of woven reeds, interlaced 
with shells and flowers, which fell 
loosely to their breasts. In these 
brief and primitive garments, the 
natives bore themselves with such 
imperious grace and assurance that 
for a moment Kirk felt as if his 
role had been abruptly reversed — 
as if instead of being the powerful 
representative of a great civilization 
to a backward people, he were the 
humble primitive waiting for their 
acceptance. 

One of the older natives stepped 
forward from the rest, his palm 
outstretched, shoulder high, in 
greeting. “Welcome to Nemar,” he 
said, his glance steady and gracious 
on Kirk’s face. 

Kirk recognized the words of the 
native language with surprise. The 
clear, musical quality of the native’s 
speech made his own words, harsh 
and grating by comparison, sound 
like a different language, as he re- 
plied. “Thank you. I am very 




22 



APRIL SMITH 




happy to be here.” 

As he spoke, he realized that the 
lie had for a moment felt almost 
like truth. For a moment he won- 
dered if the planet’s apparent prim- 
itiveness was deceptive and if its 
simplicity concealed a highly de- 
veloped culture. But even as the 
hope surged through him, he re- 
membered Ross’s clear and definite 
statement to the contrary. Besides, 
there would be no point in keeping 
a thing like that secret from the 
rest of the galaxy, even if it could 
be done. Such a culture, moreover, 
would certainly have things of 
value to trade. 

As these thoughts coursed 
through his mind, one of the Ter- 
rans stepped forward from the 
crowd. The insignia on his uniform 
were the same as his own, and he 
realized, with a surge of curiosity, 
that this must be his predecessor. 

The man reached forward to 
shake his hand. “Hello. The name’s 
Jerwyn.” His tanned face was open 
and friendly, and reminded Kirk 
curiously of someone; he couldn’t 
remember who. “Glad to see you.” 

I’ll bet you are, Kirk thought: 
your gain, my loss. “Greetings from 
Terra,” he replied, somewhat stiff- 
ly. “Cyril Kirk.” He tried to keep 
his vague disapproval of Jerwyn’s 
breezy informality out of his voice. 
It was hard to realize this man was 
also a Planetary Administrator. He 
seemed to have lost completely the 
look of authority that was the life- 
long mark of the PA graduate. 

After the various introductions 
and a short period of conversation, 
Kirk found himself seated beside 

birthright 



Jerwyn in the small ground vehicle 
which was to take him to his head- 
quarters. Jerwyn immediately re- 
sumed the standard Galactic-Ter- 
ran language, which he had 
dropped during the introductions. 
“As soon as I show you around a 
bit. I’ll be off on the landing ship 
you came in. I wonder how Terra 
will seem after all this time.” 

“Five years is a long time,” Kirk 
ventured. 

“Ten.” 

Kirk stared at him in astonish- 
ment. “You took the optional five 
years! Why in heaven would any- 
one — ” He broke off suddenly. The 
question might be one Jerwyn 
would not care to answer. He threw 
him a speculative glance, wonder- 
ing why he had been sent here and 
whether he, too, was bitter. Maybe 
a poor record, or something in his 
past he didn’t care to go back to 
. ? That didn’t fit in his own 
case — but then there was no know- 
ing what did fit in his own case. 
Jerwyn had an alert, perceptive 
look that indicated considerable in- 
telligence, but still he somehow 
looked inadequate. Some quality an 
Administrator should have was 
lacking . dignity? drive? 

Jerwyn’s voice interrupted his 
thoughts. “Beautiful, isn’t it?” 

The groundcar had left the plain 
and was entering a heavily wooded 
section. For the first time, Kirk took 
a good look at his surroundings. 
Some of the trees and plants were 
very like those he had seen in 
parks at home. Still, there was a 
definitely alien feel to it all. The 
trees were low and wide and had 
peculiar contours, different from 

23 




those of trees on Terra, and their 
flowering foliage came in odd sizes 
and colors. The sky wasn’t quite 
the blue he was used to, and the 
shapes of the clouds were different. 
He noticed for the first time a 
heady, pungent perfume carried on 
the breeze, that was both pleasant 
and stimulating. It came, perhaps, 
from the wide-petaled flowers in 
oddly shimmering colors that 
clustered thickly everywhere. 

“Yes, it’s beautiful,” he agreed, 
“but — ” The feeling of despair and 
frustration welled up in him again. 
The warmth he sensed in Jerwyn 
made him suddenly long to blurt 
out the whole story. He controlled 
himself with difficulty, as he turned 
toward him. “It’s pretty enough. It 
might make a good vacation resort 
if it weren’t on the edge of no- 
where.” His pent-up emotion ex- 
ploded as he spoke. “But five years 
in this hole! I’d feel a hell of a lot 
better if I were looking at some 
rocky, barren landscape with some 
mines on it — with something of 
value on it — ^with a name some- 
body’d heard of, where you could 
hope to get somewhere. I don’t 
want to waste five years here!” He 
paused for breath, staring angrily 
at the lush landscape. “And for 
that matter, life on one of those 
planets where you live under domes, 
with a sealed-in atmosphere, is 
probably a lot more civilized and 
convenient than in this primitive 
jungle.” 

Jerwyn nodded slowly, an un- 
spoken compassion in his face. “I 
know how you’re feeling.” He 
paused. “And it does seem pretty 
primitive here at first — no auto- 

24 



matic precipitrons for cleaning your 
clothes, natural foods instead of 
synthetics, no aircars, no automatic 
dispensers for food or drinks or 
clothes; none of a hundred things 
you take for granted till you don’t 
have them. But you get used to it. 
There are things to make up — ” 
He broke off as the car began to 
descend into a valley. “Look!” His 
voice held an odd tone of affection. 
“There’s your new home.” 

Kirk gazed downward at the set- 
tlement nested in the valley below 
them. He fished in his pocket for a 
magnascope to bring the view 
nearer and stared curiously, as the 
lens adjusted to the distance. He 
picked out groups of buildings, low 
units of some coarse, natural ma- 
terial, widely spaced. This was the 
largest city on the planet, he knew, 
but it seemed to be little more 
than a village. It was undoubtedly 
primitive — ^very primitive. Remem- 
bering the magnificent high build- 
ings of Terra, he was filled with 
sudden homesickness for the speed- 
ing sidewalks crowded with people, 
the skylanes humming with aircars. 

Turning the magnascope here 
and there, he kept his gaze trained 
on the town beneath him, studying 
it now in more detail. Slowly, some 
of his depression began to leave 
him, and he felt a strange sense 
of warmth begin to take its place. 
He stepped up the power of the 
glass till he could see the inhabi- 
tants walking in the streets. Like 
the natives who had met him at 
the landing ship, they walked with 
a beautiful, easy grace, a sumptuous 
ease that seemed somehow almost a 
rebuke of his own stiffly correct 

APRIL SMITH 




military posture. They gave an im- 
pression of combined leisure and 
vitality. 

Gradually, as he watched, an odd 
feeling of nostalgia began to stir 
in him, an old, childish longing. He 
remembered suddenly a dream he 
had had years ago, in which he had 
run laughing through green mead- 
ows with a lovely girl. He had 
fought against waking from it and 
returning to his desk piled high 
with books and his ascetically fur- 
nished room. 

He blinked his eyes and put 
down the magnascope. “Rather at- 
tractive, in a way,” he said grudg- 
ingly to Jerwyn. He settled back 
slowly into his seat. 

“Just the same,” he added, an- 
noyed at himself for his sentimental 
lapse, “how have you managed to 
stand it all this time? I still can’t 
figure how I came to get it in the 
neck like this.” Abruptly, he 
plunged into the words he had 
been holding back, telling the whole 
story of his confusion to Jerwyn. 

He rationalized to himself that 
perhaps Jerwyn could help him 
solve the mystery. At least he might 
tell him how he himself came to be 
sent to Nemar, without his having 
to ask directly; and this might give 
him a clue. 

“I’ve been over the whole busi- 
ness a million times, trying to figure 
it out,” he concluded. “Someb^ody 
with pull must have had it in for 
me. But who? And why? I never 
had any real run-ins with Ross. In 
fact. I’d always thought he liked 
me.” He scowled. “Of course, he 
gives practically everybody that im- 
pression. Maybe he’s just a profes- 

BIRTHRIGHT 



sional glad-hander, though he cer- 
tainly doesn’t seem like it.” He 
shook his head. “Maybe that’s the 
secret of his success; I never could 
figure out how he got where he is. 
He certainly doesn’t seem typical 
of the command. Oh, he’s brilliant 
enough, but there’s a quality about 
him I’d almost call — weak, I guess. 
Unsuitable for his post, anyway. 
He treats the janitor the same 
as — ” 

Kirk stopped abruptly. He sud- 
denly had the answer to the ques- 
tion that had been nagging at the 
edge of his mind: it was Ross that 
Jerwyn reminded him of. 

Trying to cover up his confusion, 
he went on rapidly, hoping Jerwyn 
would not notice. “Anyway, what- 
ever his reasons were, he’s played 
me a dirty trick, and if there’s ever 
any way I can pay him back for it. 
I’ll do it. I’ll have five years to 
think about it. Me ! The fair-haired 
boy of the Institute! On my way to 
the top!” His face flushed with re- 
sentment. “Sent to sweat out five 
years in this Godforsaken place 
with a bunch of savages hardly 
evolved out of the jungle!” He 
passed his hand over his forehead, 
wiping off sweat, feeling the full 
force of his pent-up anguish and 
rage flood through him. 

Jerwyn spoke very quickly. “I 
felt pretty much the same way 
when I was sent here. But I feel 
differently now. I could try to ex- 
plain. But I don’t think it’s a good 
idea. I don’t think anyone could 
have explained to me. This is a 
place you’ve got to live in; you 
can’t be told about it.” He shifted 
in his seat as a small group of 

25 




buildings came into view. “As for 
Ross — well, he was responsible for 
my being sent here, too, and I spent 
some time when I first came, think- 
ing of ways to cut his body in little 
pieces and throw them in a gar- 
bage pulverizer — but I wouldn’t 
waste my time if I were you. I 
know now he had his reasons.” As 
he spoke the car pulled to a stop. 
“Well, here we are. This is where 
you’ll be living and working.” 

Jerwyn stayed with Kirk while 
he was shown through various 
buildings. He found most of the 
office buildings full of bright murals 
and little watered patios, but lack- 
ing the simplest devices for working 
efficiency. He was introduced to 
various officials, Terran and Ne- 
marian. Some of the latter, to his 
surprise, were women — a rare 
phenomenon for a primitive planet, 
he remembered from his classes. 

By the time the touring was 
over and he had said goodbye to 
Jerwyn, he was too tired to do more 
than glance briefly at the quarters 
to which he was shown. Left alone 
in his rooms, he took a quick, awk- 
ward bath, too weary to feel more 
than a brief annoyance at the lack 
of automatic buttons for tempera- 
ture controls, soaping, and drying, 
and fell exhausted on the low bed. 



F or a moment, as he woke, 
Kirk could not remember where 
he was. Drowsiness mingled with a 
sense of eeriness at the sound of 
long bird-calls unlike any on Terra 
and the unfamiliar rustling of 
leaves ; the rays from the late iter- 
noon sun seemed too crimson. 



Then, as sleep fell from his eyes, 
he remembered. He glanced at the 
window above his bed from which 
the orange light filtered into the 
room and saw it was completely 
open to the outside air. Something 
would have to done about that, he 
thought grimly, or he’d never be 
able to sleep with an easy mind. 
There were always people, sooner 
or later, who hated you if you had 
power; or if they didn’t hate you, 
they at least wanted you out of 
commission for one reason or 
another. 

He sat up to take a better look 
at the room he had been too tired 
to investigate before. There were 
mats of woven reeds, and low 
carved chests, and flowers ; the 
walls were clean and glimmering, 
and bare except for a single picture 
of two young native children. He 
got up and walked over to look at 
it more closely. A boy of about 
seven was holding his arm out to a 
girl, slightly younger, to help her 
on to the low, swaying branch on 
which he was sitting. The picture 
was full of sunshine and green 
leaves and happiness, and you 
could feel the trusting softness of 
her arms reaching up to him. An 
odd picture, Kirk thought. The 
children looked childlike enough, 
but the emotions looked adult. 

As he looked at it, he heard a 
soft, swishing sound in the next 
room, and stiffened. There was no 
lock on the door, he noticed. Well, 
it was time to get up, anyway. He 
dressed hurriedly, trying to remem- 
ber the layout of his rooms. Except 
for the bathroom, he recalled only 
one other room, a sort of arbored 



26 



APRIL SMITH 




porch, one side completely open to 
the air, with a low table and some 
cooking equipment at one end. 

As he opened the door, a faint 
whisk of something made of reeds 
went out of sight. A primitive 
broom, he thought, with a faint 
sense of relief. Some servant was 
tidying the house. He opened the 
door further — and stared, 

A native girl was standing before 
him. She was extraordinarily love- 
ly. The gold-green hair of her race 
rippled and flowed in waves over 
her bare back and shoulders down 
to the circlet of vermilion cloth 
girdling her thighs. The band of 
small shells that circled her throat 
was netted with wide orange and 
red flowers that half -hid, half -dis- 
closed the firm naked breasts. The 
light brown, gold-flecked eyes be- 
neath the gold-green eyebrows were 
soft ; so was the tender mouth, rose- 
colored against the flawless skin, 
with its undertones of faint green. 
Her body, too, looked soft and 
yielding, but was borne with im- 
perious grace that somehow dig- 
nified even the broom held loosely 
now in one delicate hand. 

Kirk stared at this vision of 
beauty, taken by surprise, and 
found himself caught up in sudden 
desire. She was like something out 
of a dream. He tried to get hold of 
himself. 

You’re just not used to half-nude 
women, he told himself. You’re 
used to girls in uniforms, crisp, 
businesslike uniforms. A wild sus- 
picion caught at the edge of his 
mind. He didn’t know anything 
about this planet, really — except 
that there was something he didn’t 

birthright 



know. Maybe they made a practice 
of diverting their rulers with beau- 
tiful women. She certainly didn’t 
look like a servant. He smiled at 
the thought that came to him : this 
servant was the first indication of 
the luxury befitting a Planetary 
Administrator. The thought en- 
abled him to gain control of him- 
self again. He regained a semblance 
of his customary reserved look. 

“Good afternoon,” he said, in the 
native language. 

She smiled and held out her 
hand. 

He hesitated, then held out his 
own awkwardly. Did one shake 
hands with one’s servants here? He 
wished he’d asked Jerwyn for more 
advice about protocol. 

She took his hand and pressed it 
lightly for a moment. “I am 
Nanae.” Her voice was low and 
musical. “I am going to clean and 
take care of your house.” 

She turned and with exquisite 
precision gestured toward the low 
table and cooking equipment at the 
end of the room. “I thought you 
would be waking soon. I have pre- 
pared some jen for you.” 

Jen? he thought. Oh, yes, a. very 
light stimulant — the local variety 
of tea. He walked over to the low 
table and sat down, fighting the 
impulse to enter into conversation 
with her. He watched her as she 
poured the hot liquid into wide 
cups of polished gourd, her hair 
radiant about her shoulders. A stab 
of longing shot through him. The 
long years of training in the In- 
stitute paraded through his mind, 
the years of strict routine, hard 
work, ascetic, bare rooms, with 

27 




women considered playthings that 
took too much time from needed 
study; the only beauty was the 
dream of power among the glitter- 
ing stars. 

Well, he wasn’t going to give up 
and forget the dream, he told him- 
self — and he wasn’t going to be led 
astray by any pretty girls, particu- 
larly a maid. Hell, he thought sud- 
denly, maybe Ross is testing me. 
Maybe he picked the worst planet 
in the whole damn galaxy to find 
out if I could do something with 
it. It’s obvious if I can get this 
place on the trademaps, I can 
handle anything. 

He looked speculatively at the 
girl as she pushed the cup toward 
him. He wondered how she came 
by her job. Did they hold beauty 
contests here for the honor of be- 
ing cleaning woman in the PA’s 
household? He realized he was feel- 
ing more cheerful. The jen and the 
soothing quietness of the girl’s pres- 
ence were doing him good. He felt 
a resurgence of his old energy and 
ambition that the interview with 
Ross had quelled for so long. 

“Did you work for Jerwyn, too?” 
he asked. Yes, his voice was just 
right, courteous, but not too friend- 
ly, he thought. 

“No, but I knew him.” She 
looked at him with an odd smile. 
“He became one of our best danc- 
ers.” 

“Dancers!” Kirk stared at her in 
amazement. He started to open his 
mouth, then stopped. He’d better 
not ask any more questions till he’d 
had a chance to talk to some Ter- 
rans. Apparently, Jerwyn had gone 
native. Maybe it was his way of re- 

28 



belling against being sent here in 
the first place — and he’d let him- 
self go so far that he’d skipped his 
chance of reassignment at the end 
of the first five years, afraid of the 
problems of a new post after be- 
ing a beachcomber for so long. 
That would account for the curious 
lack of deference he’d found in all 
these people. They were friendly 
enough, but they lacked proper re- 
spect for his position. You weren’t 
supposed to be friendly to a PA; 
you were supposed to be humbly 
polite. He recalled the respect and 
awe he’d received on the ship. 

As he finished his cup, he real- 
ized he was very hungry. He looked 
around instinctively for food. He 
had enough synthetics in his bags 
to do him for awhile, but he might 
as well make the plunge and start 
eating the native foods right away. 
No use coddling himself. 

The girl noticed the look. “I 
didn’t prepare food for you because 
dinner will be served in just a little 
while. We eat all together, down 
by the river. You will hear drums 
to announce when the meal is 
ready, and you get there by walking 
to the end of that path.” She 
pointed a delicate finger at a small 
foot-path winding by a few yards 
from where he sat. 



OMING OUT of the little for- 
est at the end of the path, 
Kirk paused to take in the scene. 
Between him and the river was a 
wild jumble of men and women, 
laughing and talking, children run- 
ning and stumbling over small pet 
animals, piles of nuts and fruits 

APRIL SMITH 





and hot foods heaped together be- 
side small fires. Some of the people 
sat on straw mats, but most, simply 
on the ground. There were neither 
tables nor chairs. To Kirk it looked 
like utter confusion. 

With a sense of gratitude, he 
saw a tall, uniformed figure com- 
ing up to him, with a brisk, definite 
stride. The Terran’s face was lined 
and firm, the kind of face Kirk was 
familiar with. The man with this 
face would be a man who stood for 
no nonsense, a man who was a little 
tough, but also fair and capable. 
He recognized him as he came 
closer. 

“Hello, sir. I’m Matt Cortland, 
your second in command,” he said 
brusquely. “I met you this after- 
noon, but you met so many people 
then it must have been just a blur 
of names and faces.” 

Kirk greeted him, feeling a sense 
of satisfaction that this man would 
be his chief assistant. He looked 
efficient; he should be able to help 
him learn the ropes and get a pro- 
gram of action started. 

“No chairs,” Cortland said la- 
conically, as they walked toward 
the gathering. He chose a soft spot 
of lavender-tinted moss near a pile 
of hot food and sat down, cross- 
legged. Awkwardly, Kirk sat down 
beside him, folding his legs under 
him stiffly. “You can be served in 
your rooms, of course, if you like,” 
Cortland went on, turning to him. 
“These people are very obliging. 
Very obliging.” He reached for 
two of the leaf-wrapped, steaming 
objects, handing one to Kirk. “But 
you probably have a better chance 
of influencing them if you eat 

birthright 



among them. If they can be in- 
fluenced.” He opened the leaf and 
bit into the yellow vegetable inside. 

Kirk looked dubiously at the ob- 
ject in his hand. He hoped it 
wouldn’t make him sick. Pushing 
back his sense of disgust, he bit into 
it carefully. The Wand, sweetish 
flavor filled him with delightful 
surprise. It was rather like a mix- 
ture of sweet potato, carrot, and 
peach synthetics — but the texture 
and flavor were new and wonder- 
ful. Maybe civilization had lost 
something good when it gave up 
natural foods. Though, of course, 
their preparation was time-wasting 
and inefficient, he reminded him- 
self; and swallowing synthetics re- 
quired only a momentary break in 
your work when you were pressed 
for time. He looked up and found 
Cortland watching him. 

“Pretty different from the food 
at home, eh?” He had slipped into 
the Terran language. “Good food 
and pretty girls.” He gestured to- 
ward the graceful, half -nude wom- 
en scattered along the mossy bank. 
“Everything for the lotus-eaters.” 
The phrase meant nothing to 
Kirk. 

One of the girls came over to 
them with a large gourd full of 
fruit and nuts, and another on 
which she heaped hot foods from 
the piles on the ground as she 
passed. She placed them on the 
ground beside the two men. 

“Yes, everything for the lotus- 
eaters,” Cortland repeated. “In- 
cidentally, I hope you’re not under 
the impression that that girl is 
naked from the waist up.” 

Kirk looked at him questioningly. 

29 




“Oh, no. She’s completely cov- 
ered. They have taboos about 
naked breasts, just like we do.” He 
laughed at Kirk’s look of mystifica- 
tion. “You notice those strands of 
shells or woven reeds they wear 
around their necks?” 

Kirk looked around. They all 
wore them. 

“Well, that signifies they are 
dressed. If you ever see a native 
girl without one, she’ll be terribly 
embarrassed.” He stuck his hand 
out toward the bowl of hot food. 
“After you’ve been here long 
enough you’ll think they’re dressed, 
too.” 

He laughed, then looked more 
serious. 

“I’ve been here a long time, get- 
ting nowhere,” he said, in a differ- 
ent tone. “There are a lot of things 
that could be done here. I’ve spent 
a lot of time thinking about it. But 
Jerwyn — ” He hesitated. “I hope 
you intend to make the name of 
the Galactic Union mean some- 
thing here.” 

Kirk nodded, and Cortland went 
on. “Jerwyn tried when he first 
came. But after awhile he seemed 
to just give up. I couldn’t do any- 
thing without him backing me, I 
don’t have enough authority.” He 
looked grim as he spoke. “And be- 
sides that, it takes more than one 
good man. Oh, the other GU men 
here are capable enough — ” He 
glanced toward a group of Ter- 
rans sitting nearby. “They’ll be 
over in a little while to speak to 
you, incidentally; I asked them to 
hold off for a litde, while I briefed 
you a bit — no sense deluging you 
with new people while you’re try- 

30 



ing to eat.” 

“But to get back,” he went on, 
“they’re capable enough, or they 
were once, anyway, but none of 
them has the drive and brains it 
takes to push through a project 
to develop this planet. They’ve 
pretty well given up. Some of them 
like it here and some of them don’t, 
but they’ve all stopped trying.” A 
look of contempt crossed his face. 
“They go through the motions of 
doing some work to earn their 
salaries, knock off at noon, and 
spend their time lying around on 
the beaches with Nemarian girls. 
I’ve done what I could to keep a 
semblance of discipline, but it’s 
uphill work.” 

Kirk looked at him steadily. “All 
that’s going to be changed.” 

Cortland smiled. “Good.” Their 
eyes met, with understanding. 

“And I’m very happy to have a 
man of your caliber with me,” Kirk 
said quietly. 

Cortland gave him a long look. 
“Maybe you’ve got what it takes. 
Maybe you have.” He nodded slow- 
ly. “I should have told you I don’t 
entirely blame the men. This plan- 
et’s a tough nut to crack.” His voice 
was grim. 

Kirk felt a vague uneasiness, but 
his look stayed determined. “We’ll 
crack it.” 

“We’ve been here forty years, 
and we haven’t made a dent. 
They’re funny people, these Ne- 
marians. They’re really alien. I’ve 
been here fifteen years, and I don’t 
understand them any better than 
when I came.” 

“That’s quite a statement.” 

“They’re very appealing. Naive.

Childlike. The soul of courtesy — 
on the surface. But it’s deceptive. 
And you could spend a lifetime try- 
ing to find out what’s underneath.” 

A young boy of about twelve 
came up as he spoke, setting a large 
gourd full of steaming liquid down 
beside them with lithe grace, filling 
smaller cups from it as he did so. 
Cortland nodded at him, turning 
again to Kirk as the boy walked 
away. “Even their children aren’t 
really childlike. Did you see his 
eyes — makes you damned uncom- 
fortable.” 

As Kirk started to answer, drum- 
beats began to fill the air, first soft- 
ly, then louder. Strange sounds 
from unfamiliar instruments began 
to mingle with them, and a clear, 
high instrument added a melody. 
The whole effect had an alien, dis- 
cordant quality for Kirk, but as he 
listened further he grew intrigued 
and began to enjoy it; a mood — 
happy and romantic and energetic, 
all at once — came through to him 
from the music. 

“The dancing’s beginning,” Cort- 
land informed him. 

Kirk saw young men and women 
rise by ones and two’s and begin 
swaying and turning their bodies 
to the music. They all seemed to be 
doing different things, and yet 
somehow it made an integrated 
pattern. To his surprise older peo- 
ple and even young children grad- 
ually joined in, and managed not 
to look inappropriate, although the 
dance movements were rapid and 
strenuous. 

He noticed a sweet, pungent odor 
filling his nostrils and realized it 
came from the steaming bowl be- 

BIRTHRIGHT 



side them. He picked up one of the 
filled cups and tried it cautiously. 
It was delightful. He emptied it 
and poured another. 

He felt Cortland’s hand on his 
arm, and looked up to find him 
grinning at him. “Hey, take it 
easy with that stuff. That’s fer- 
mented kara root — the local variety 
of booze. They can drink quarts 
of the stuff and be all right; I’ve 
never seen one of them really 
drunk. But you’d better not try it.” 

Kirk frowned. “Something dif- 
ferent in our metabolism? I 
thought — ” 

“No, they’re quite human,” Cort- 
land broke in. “And it’s not a mat- 
ter of immunity. I wondered about 
it for a long time — and got quite 
disgracefully drunk a couple of 
times, keeping up with them, before 
I figured it out.” He sipped at his 
own cup. “No, the secret of their 
success is the dancing.” 

Kirk looked at the light, whirl- 
ing figures, puzzled. 

Cortland smiled at his bewilder- 
ment. “It’s the exercise. It bums 
up the alcohol as fast as they drink 
it. When they’re having a real feast, 
they dance and drink all night, till 
they collapse from pure exhaustion. 
They wake up feeling fine — not a 
sign of a hangover. Of course, to- 
night they’ll only dance for a little 
while, so they’ll only drink a 
little . .” 

“Sensible, aren’t they?” The 
voice came out of the air behind 
them, sardonic, feminine. The lan- 
guage was Terran. 

Kirk whirled and peered through 
the dusk, which was gathering 

31 




rapidly. He saw a slightly amused 
pair of brown eyes, brunette hair, 
and a trim body dressed in chic 
good taste in expensive Terran 
clothes. 

Cortland stood up. “Mrs. Sherrin 
. our new Planetary Administra- 
tor, Cyril Kirk.” 

She lowered herself to the 
ground, spreading out a small mat 
under her as she did so. “Jeannette, 
if you don’t mind.” She folded her 
legs under her carefully. “I don’t 
mean to be disrespectful. But 
there’s such a small number of us 
here, we need to be friends and 
stick together.” 

Cortland, who had been looking 
away for a moment turned to them. 
“If you’ll excuse me, someone 
wants to talk to me.” Kirk nodded. 

“Did I meet your husband this 
afternoon?” he inquired politely, as 
Cortland strode off. 

“No; I’m a widow.” 

“Oh, I’m sorry,” he murmured. 

“Don’t be. Not for me, I mean. 
We’d been coming to a parting of 
the ways for a long time. But let’s 
not talk about that. How do you 
like the dancing?” 

He looked at the firelit figures, 
whirling in the growing dusk. “I 
don’t know. I’m sort of over- 
whelmed by everything. It’s all so 
new. I’ve heard so many confusing 
things — ” 

She nodded. “If you manage 
to make sense out of the Nemar- 
ians, you’ll make history. It’s better 
not to worry about it too much. Im- 
merse yourself in their gay, happy 
life.” 

“What do you mean?” 

She gave him a sharp look. 



“You’ll find out what I mean. 
Didn’t Cortland tell you?” 

“What are you talking about?” 
“Well, you might as well go in 
cold at that. Form your own con- 
clusions as you go along. No use 
giving you prejudices before you 
start. Maybe you’re the man who’ll 
cut the Gordian knot. No use tell- 
ing you it can’t be done.” 

“What can’t be done?” 

“We’ll all be rooting for you.” 
She poured herself a drink and 
downed it quickly. “Great stuff, 
this. Makes you forget the petty 
annoyances of the garden-spot of 
the galaxy.” She poured another. 
“To Nemar,” she said, lifting it. 
“Now tell me about Terra. What’s 
been happening back home?” 

He coidd get nothing more out 
of her. 



K irk struggled to control 

his irritation as the last Ne- 
marian on his list walked in, poised 
and self-confident, casually uncon- 
cerned about his lateness. Some- 
thing would have to be done about 
their sloppiness and lack of dis- 
cipline, but now wasn’t the time. 
It wouldn’t do to lose his temper at 
the first official meeting he called. 

First he needed to stir some am- 
bition in them, prod them out of 
their lethargy. 

He looked around at the assem- 
bled members of his joint Terran- 
Nemarian staff. The Terran mem- 
bers were making an attempt to 
stand stiffly at attention, some- 
what awkwardly as though they 
were out of practice. They threw 
rather disconcerted looks at his 



32 



APRIL SMITH 




stern, impassive young face. The 
Nemarians stood casually erect or 
lounged against the wall. 

Once more, he found himself 
troubled by a faint sense of incon- 
gruity. Something about these na- 
tives was not primitive. Without 
saying a word, just by standing and 
looking at him, they made him feel 
awkward and insecure. 

He straightened his shoulders 
and tried to make his expression 
even more stem. He wished he 
looked older. 

A sense of the power of his posi- 
tion overwhelmed him for a mo- 
ment. 

He glanced at the speech he’d 
prepared, then at the faces before 
him. Slowly he pushed it aside. 
Somehow he couldn’t use those 
formal sentences with these people. 
Diplomatic phrases didn’t sound 
right in Nemarian. 

“Good morning,” he said abrupt- 
ly. “I won’t waste time on prelimi- 
naries.” He paused. “I’ve only been 
here a day, but so far I’ve seen 
very few signs of Terran influence 
— a more or less obsolete type of 
ground transportation, a few tools 
and household conveniences, some 
art objects. Very little else. I don’t 
fully understand why conditions are 
so backward here on Nemar when 
it has been part of the Galactic 
Union for forty years.” 

The Terrans in the group stirred 
uneasily. 

“The important thing, however, 
is that the situation be changed so 
that Nemar may be given the bene- 
fits of galactic culture.” 

He paused and looked around. 
The natives were listening cour- 

BIRTHRIGHT 



teously and looking slightly bored. 
The Terrans looked uneasy or em- 
barrassed. 

“What prevents this change,” he 
went on, “is the fact that there is 
nothing of value to export.” He 
leaned forward. “But I don’t be- 
lieve that this or any planet can 
possess nothing of value. It’s sim- 
ply a matter of finding it. It’s a 
matter of looking into new places, 
with new techniques, or for new 
things. If a sufficiently thorough 
search is made, something will turn 
up.” He tried to ignore the signs 
of restlessness in his audience. 

“I’m going to organize research 
groups for thus purpose immediate- 
ly. Each of you will head a commit- 
tee to investigate the possibilities in 
a particular field — ^fuels, plants, 
animal products, etc. You will 
bring the reports to me, and I will 
check them and indicate further 
directions of search.” 

He continued, outlining his plans 
in detail, stressing the great advan- 
tages to be gained, the wonderful 
things galactic culture had to offer 
them — the marvelous machines and 
labor-saving devices, the rich fab- 
rics and jewels, the vidar entertain- 
ments, the whole fabulous tech- 
nology of a great, advanced civiliza- 
tion. He spoke with enthusiasm, 
but as he continued, a growing 
sense of apprehension began to 
creep into his energetic, determined 
mood. 

Something was wrong with their 
reactions. 

He puzzled over it as he watched 
them file out of the room after he 
finished. The voice of one of his 
younger subordinates drifted back 

33 




to him from the hall outside: 
“Made me homesick for good old 
Terra. I’d give a lot to see a good 
vidar-show right now ...” Cort- 
land pressed his arm lightly as he 
passed, nodding his approval of 
the proceedings. 

One of the Terrans lingered a 
moment as the last of the group 
left. His expression was serious. “I’d 
like you to know that I’m all for 
you, sir, and I’m glad to see a man 
of your stature in the PA’s office,” 
he said nervously. “I hope we’ll see 
some changes in the attitude of 
these Nemarians. I’ve never liked 
their attitude.” He ran a hand 
through his sandy-colored hair. 
“They’re funny people, sir. You’ve 
only been here a day, and nobody 
may have warned you yet. They’re 
very courteous, but don’t let it fool 
you. You’re going to have trouble 
with them.” 

Kirk looked after him as he fol- 
lowed the others out, a sense of 
confusion and discouragement be- 
ginning to settle over him. He 
wandered slowly into the flowered 
patio adjoining the office. 

The reaction of the Nemarian 
officials was the strangest. They 
had shown no open opposition. On 
the other hand, there had certainly 
been no cheering. Their attitude 
had been one of courteous interest, 
plus some quality he couldn’t quite 
define. He searched for the right 
word . something almost like 
compassion, as if they were humor- 
ing a child’s enthusiasm for a 
naive, impractical project. 

He sat down by a clump of blue- 
green flowers. Maybe he was just 
nervous because of his inexperi- 

34 



ence, he thought. He’d had plenty 
of practice experience (supervised, 
of course), but it was a different 
matter managing an isolated plan- 
et, completely on his own. And 
he’d had the bad luck to come 
after a guy who’d apparently let 
discipline go to pieces. Maybe it 
was just the newness of the whole 
thing. Maybe — 

But he knew better. 

He had given them a good, ef- 
ficient, well-organized plan of ac- 
tion. They should have been im- 
pressed — impressed and respectful. 
They should have been grateful he 
was plunging so enthusiastically 
into an effort to improve their 
situation. They should have been 
excited and hopeful. 

There was something strange 
here, something he didn’t under- 
stand. 

He knew so little about Nemar. 

The Terrans in the group had 
not reacted as they should have, 
either, he thought. Some of them 
had shown the sort of reaction he 
expected, but most of them had re- 
mained quiet, too quiet, with a 
peculiar, tolerant look. As if they 
knew something he didn’t. 

There was something disturbing 
about their whole manner. They 
were respectful and deferential, but 
not quite respectful enough. Their 
attitude was just a shade too casual. 
Something was wrong. 

They even looked different, 
somehow, from the usual Terran 
on space duty. The dedicated look 
was gone and a softness had crept 
in. 

Somehow, the planet had in- 
fected them.

T he clear-eyed old Ne- 

marian he’d been talking to 
had just turned away when she 
came up. 

“Good evening. How do you like 
bird’s eggs a la Nemar?” Jeannette 
pointed to the shells beside him. 

“Hello. They’re very good.” He 
motioned her to sit down. 

“The youngsters here gather 
them out of the trees. They make 
a sport of it.” She reached for one 
from the pile near them and tapped 
it open. “Sentimental creatures — 
they always leave one or two so the 
mother bird won’t be unhappy.” 
Kirk was trying to draw his eyes 
away from the young Nemarian 
mother in the group near him who 
was complacently nursing her baby 
in full view of everyone. Jeannette 
stared in the direction of his look. 

“Oh, you’ll get used to that soon 
enough.” 

He wondered if he would. They 
made a rather touching picture, 
though, he realized through his 
embarrassment. There was a lot of 
tenderness in the woman’s gestures. 

“They spoil their children rot- 
ten.” 

Kirk looked surprised. “The ones 
I’ve seen have been very courte- 
ous.” 

She shrugged. “Oh, they’re po- 
lite enough. But just try and make 
them do something they don’t want 
to! They’re completely undis- 
ciplined — they’re fed when they 
please, they sleep when they please, 
they do whatever they like. They 
have schools for them, but it’s 
completely up to the children 
whether they want to go or not. 
The parents haven’t a thing to say 

birthright 



about it. No one ever lays a hand 
to them, no matter what they do.” 
“I haven’t noticed any quarrel- 
ing,” he said, surprised at his own 
observation. It was true. He hadn’t 
seen a sign of it, even between the 
children themselves, though they 
made enough noise yelling and 
romping. 

“Oh, those tactics fit them per- 
fectly for this society,” she said in- 
differently. “The adults here are 
just like the children. Nobody ever 
does any work.” 

“But that’s impossible. The food, 
the houses, the — ” 

“Well, I suppose I exaggerated. 
They do things they don’t like once 
in awhile, if they want the end 
product enough. But mostly, if they 
can’t make a big game of it, they 
don’t do it. Tomorrow’s nut-gath- 
ering day,” she added irrelevantly. 
“Nut-gathering day?” 

“Yes. Everybody frolics off into 
the hills to pick nuts. Like a picnic. 
That’s what I mean — if they didn’t 
consider it a pleasure outing, the 
nuts could hit them on the head, 
and they’d never bother to pick 
them up.” She cocked her head at 
him. “Want to go?” 

“Go where? Nut-gathering, you 
mean?” He laughed. “No, thanks.” 
“Thought you might like to study 
the natives in their day-to-day ac- 
tivities, get the real local flavor. 
You might learn something, at that. 
Though I guess you’d have a rough 
time climbing the trees.” 

“I’ve had an hour a day at gym- 
nastics for the past three years.” 
“Yes, you look in good shape.” 
Her glance swept over him ap- 
provingly. “But gymnastics and 

35 




those trees are two different things. 
The edible nuts grow on the tall 
trees, not the short ones, and they 
sway in the wind. The young men 
do most of the climbing. They’re 
pretty wonderful physical speci- 
mens, I’ll say that.” She glanced at 
one of them near by, who was 
whispering in the ear of a Nemar- 
ian girl. 

Kirk felt oddly annoyed. They 
were magnificent physical speci- 
mens, he thought. But then so 
were the women and children. He 
realized that he hadn’t seen a sick- 
ly or weak-looking native since he 
arrived. Even the old people kept 
their magnificent posture, and 
managed to make age seem a mat- 
ter of gathering wisdom instead of 
collecting infirmities. Weren’t they 
ever sick, he wondered. 

“The girls are lovely, too,” he re- 
minded her. 

“Yes, but try to get near one of 
them,” she flashed back. “They 
prefer their own.” Her eyes nar- 
rowed. “They’re pleasant people, 
but they’re not pleasant to live 
with. It gets on your nerves after 
awhile.” 

“Why didn’t you leave, Jean- 
nette?” 

“On the spaceship you came 
on?” 

“Yes. There may not be another 
for five years.” 

“That’s the big question,” she 
said slowly. “I’m not sure I know 
the answer. I half intended to leave 
on the ship when it came. But 
when it came down to it, I didn’t 
leave.” She stared ahead of her. 
“Something about the place gets 
you. Maybe it’s the lif^. Maybe you 

36 



get used to lying around in the 
sun, and you feel kind of frightened 
at returning to all the hustle and 
bustle of Terra. And then, you 
keep waiting, hoping that — ” 

“Hoping what?” 

For a moment, she looked de- 
fenseless and a little hurt. Then 
the cynical smile came back. “You 
don’t even know what you’re hop- 
ing for, really,” she said lightly. 

He knew she was evading him. 

He lay in bed later, wondering 
what Jeannette could have meant, 
what could accoimt for that brief 
hurt look. 

She was an attractive girl, he 
thought idly. He wondered why he 
felt nothing for her, when the na- 
tive girl aroused in him such an 
unreasonable longing. It would be 
a good deal more convenient to fall 
for Jeannette. 

He couldn’t afford to get mixed 
up with his maid. 

Remembering her, he suddenly 
felt his body trembling. 

All right, he told himself, so she’s 
an ignorant, backward native on a 
planet nobody ever heard of. Prac- 
tically a savage. And even here, 
she’s just a maid, a cleaning wom- 
an. Nobody a Planetary Adminis- 
trator could think about getting 
mixed up with. But how do they 
turn them out like that? 

How do they turn them out like 
that, he thought — every movement 
fluid, every position graceful, every 
gesture exquisite? How does this 
nonentity of a planet turn out a 
girl with the kind of walk the video- 
stars back home practice and work 
years to approach? With a voice 

APRIL SMITH 




with that indescribable music and 
precision? With a flawless skin, ra- 
diant hair, a serenity auid self-con- 
fidence that would make the great- 
est beauties on Terra envious? With 
a quiet, careless pride that made 
him, the new ruler of her planet, 
awkward and insecure in the pres- 
ence of his own servant? 

Jeannette had been jealous, he 
realized suddenly. She was jealous 
of these girls, of their grace, of 
their radiance. Her cynicism cov- 
ered a bitter envy. 

For a long time he lay there, 
trying to sleep, haunted by Nanae’s 
luminous eyes. 

H e started working the next 
morning. 

There was no use putting it off, 
he thought. Nemar seemed to act 
like a drug, gradually depriving 
you of your drive and ambition. He 
wasn’t going to give it a chance to 
let its poison seep into him. 

He flung himself into his duties 
as Planetary Administrator with a 
grim determination. He struggled 
to organize the affairs of the planet 
on a more efficient basis. He intro- 
duced new methods and tech- 
niques. He worked tirelessly, relent- 
lessly, hardly noticing their passage 
as one day followed another. And 
every moment he could spare, he 
devoted to the project for finding 
something of value to export. 

He was going to put this planet 
on the map. He didn’t know how 
yet, but he was going to do it. 

He was going to turn his misfor- 
tune into a triumph. 

Every hint of a possibility was 

birthright 



followed up with eagerness. Every 
lead, every clue, was the subject of 
exhaustive study and investigation. 
His days were a succession of 
guarded hopes and disappoint- 
ments, of surges of optimism and 
long stretches of discouragement. 
He pushed his wearied body into 
greater and greater efforts, working 
unflaggingly through the day and 
most of the night, spurred by the 
anger that still burned in him. 

The natives, he knew, looked at 
the light burning late into the 
night and thought he was a little 
crazy. He gave up eating with 
them. It was too easy, there by 
the river, to drift into staying later 
and later, drinking their hot wine, 
chatting, watching the dancing. It 
was too hard to resist tihe tempta- 
tion of midnight swimming later 
with the young men and women at 
the nearby beach, with revels and 
bonfires on the lavender sands aft- 
erward. 

At the end of two weeks, he sat 
on his bed, taking stock of what 
he had accomplished. 

It was very little. 

And he was very tired. 

The tiredness was familiar. It 
was just like school all over again, 
he thought, the same long exhaust- 
ing hours of driving oneself relent- 
lessly. He wondered when he’d be 
able to relax. He didn’t dare relax 
now. When he had a lead, a defi- 
nite hope of some kind, he could 
begin to let up. But not till then. 
It would be too easy to give up and 
let go altogether, go the way Jer- 
wyn had gone. 

He was beginning to understand 

37 




why Jerwyn had given up. 

He was beginning to understand 
a lot of things — the odd, cryptic 
remarks he had heard about the 
natives when he first arrived, the 
mixed admiration and exasperation 
they seemed to arouse. 

He remembered a man named 
Gandhi from ancient Indian his- 
tory. 

The Nemarians could have given 
Gandhi lessons. 

Working with them was like 
working with an invisible wall of 
resistance that weakened here and 
strengthened there, gave in un- 
expectedly at one place and resisted 
implacably at another. 

At times his plans were praised; 
then they were put into eflfect with 
an efficiency that astonished him. 
At other times they were criticized, 
in a casual, friendly manner that 
enraged him. Then they were not 
put into effect at all. When he in- 
sisted on obedience, the natives 
reacted with an attitude of patient 
tolerance, and did nothing. Most of 
the time, his orders were received 
indifferently and carried out with 
an agonizing slowness. 

He pushed and prodded them. 
He reasoned with them. He shouted 
at them. 

He reaped nothing but frustra- 
tion. 

They didn’t hate him. He knew 
that. He had never seen a trace of 
malice in their expressions. People 
smiled at him when he passed, 
and children came up to tug at 
his hand and ask him to come to 
visit their house. There was none 
of the stony hatred here he knew 
existed in many places for the all- 

38 



powerful Galactic Union. 

They simply seemed to lack all 
appreciation of the importance of 
his position. 

Yet they knew, he thought. They 
knew he had what amounted to al- 
most unlimited power over their 
planet. They knew a space-fleet 
that had burned life off the face 
of entire planets lay at his disposal. 
They knew he could crush any re- 
bellion instantly. 

But, of course, they weren’t re- 
belling, he thought. They weren’t 
even openly uncooperative. There 
it was again : they weren’t even un- 
friendly; they deluged him with 
constant invitations. 

They knew of his power, but 
they acted as if it didn’t exist. 

And he wasn’t sure they weren’t 
going to win with him, as they had 
with Jerwyn. The Galactic Union 
did not look with approval on any 
call for aid except in a military 
crisis; such a request was in effect 
an affidavit of failure. Besides, he 
didn’t want to complain. He didn’t 
want to set himself against them. 
He was working for them, not just 
for himself. 

He sighed and began to get 
ready for bed. 

Primitive people had always 
fought progress and change. They 
had always clung to old, outworn 
methods. But there was more to it 
than that, he thought. Primitive 
people were usually full of super- 
stitious fear of change, but the Ne- 
marians were not afraid. You 
couldn’t think of them as fearful. 
They knew the danger — they knew 
the strength and power that faced 
them — but they were not afraid. 

APRIL SMITH 




They didn’t even “handle with 
care”. 

Where did their courage come 
from? 

Or was it just blind stupidity, he 
thought, a refusal to look facts in 
the face, to admit that they were 
the helpless, backward subjects of 
an immensely more powerful and 
more advanced civilization? 

He pulled off a shoe absently, 
and he thought of all the docu- 
ments and reports he had read 
about Nemar. Ross had given them 
to him, and he had searched in 
them for a clue to help him under- 
stand why Ross was sending him 
here. He had read and reread 
them, and they had told him little 
more than Ross himself about Ne- 
mar. 

There was something peculiar 
about all those documents, he 
thought, something odd about the 
way they were written. They de- 
scribed an undeveloped planet 
without valuable resources or any 
kind of technology, in no way out 
of the ordinary. But between the 
lines was something that said this 
planet was out of the ordinary, in 
spite of the apparent facts. There 
was the unavoidable feeling that 
something was left unsaid. 

What were they trying to hide? 
Why hadn’t they let him know 
what he was in for? 

Terrans had been coming for 
forty years. In forty years, they 
must have learned something. They 
must have found out something 
about what made these people the 
way they were, and about how to 
deal with them. There should have 
been warnings and suggestions and 

birthright 



at least, if nothing else, descriptions 
of methods that had been tried and 
failed. It should all have been there, 
out in the open; it should have 
been down in black and white: this 
is the situation, so far as we know 
it; these are the problems. 

Instead, there had been only 
routine description, and veiled 
hints and allusions. 

He hadn’t been here long, he 
thought. There was a lot to learn 
here yet. The other Terrans, the 
ones who had been here a long 
time, knew something he didn’t 
know. He could tell from their 
faces, from their attitude toward 
him. Cortland didn’t know, or he 
would have told him, and some of 
the others didn’t either, but most 
of them did. They knew something, 
but whether it was pleasant or un- 
pleasant knowledge, he couldn’t 
tell. Whatever it was, it affected 
them. They neglected their work, 
and they had a different look from 
the Terrans back home. 

Jerwyn had known, and he 
hadn’t told him. He’d said he’d 
have to live here to find out. 

He lay down and stretched out 
wearily on the bed. 

Well, the answers here exist, he 
thought. Somehow, when he had 
all the pieces, the jigsaw would 
have to fit together and make a 
coherent picture. 

Maybe he was looking in the 
wrong direction. 

But he didn’t know where to 
look. 

He thought of the day he had 
just been through, remembering 
incident after incident when he 
had had all he could do to keep 

39 




his temper under control. Annoy- 
ance welled up in him again, as 
he recalled the series of frustrations, 
the useless arguments. 

His mind was still revolving in 
2in upheaval of confusion and an- 
ger as he fell asleep. 

I T WAS BARELY past dawn 
when he awoke. He tried to fall 
asleep again and failed. Giving up, 
he dressed and wandered into the 
other room and the garden beyond. 
He felt the early morning coolness 
slipping over his shoulders like a 
garment, and a sense of the futility 
of all his struggling filled him. He 
felt a sudden longing to rest, bask 
in the sun, live as the natives did 
in sunny, amiable unconcern. 

He stiffened, annoyed at him- 
self. That would mean giving up 
everything he had worked so hard 
for all his life, ending up as a lazy 
failure. He felt a surge of anger 
inside him toward something he 
could hardly name. 

As he stood there, he saw two 
Nemarian children, a boy and a 
girl about five years old, emerge 
from the trees and begin to pick 
the shimmering flowers in the gar- 
den. Irritation rose hotly in him. 
He knew that it was out of propor- 
tion, built out of a hundred frus- 
trating incidents, but he found he 
didn’t want to control it. He 
wanted to lash out at somebody. 

“Stop stealing my flowers!” he 
yelled. He was surprised at the 
harshness of his own voice. 

The children did not start fear- 
fully or run, as he expected. They 
turned and stared at him in an un- 



concerned manner. “You can’t 
steal flowers,” the boy said matter- 
of-factly. “They don’t belong to 
anybody.” He looked at Kirk ques- 
tioningly. “You didn’t plant them, 
did you?” 

Kirk stared at him, speechless. 

The boy went on, his tone slight- 
ly indignant. “Anyway, it’s very 
rude of you to speak to us like 
that!” 

“They are quite right,” an an- 
gry voice cut in. !l^rk whirled 
around to find Nanae standing be- 
side him, a basket in her hand. 
Her hair, radiant in the sunlight, 
was caught back from her face 
with a green ribbon, and the brown, 
gold-flecked eyes, for once, were 
not soft, but sparkling with anger. 
“These are my sister’s children,” 
she said icily. “They help me gather 
flowers for your table. Do you 
think just because they are young 
you have the right to treat them 
without respect?” 

Staring at her angry face, Kirk 
felt his own anger ebbing. Into his 
mind a forgotten incident flashed 
back from his childhood. Through 
a door left ajar in a neighboring 
apartment he had seen a ripe 
purple fruit imported from a newly 
discovered planet, and had taken it, 
curious to find out what unsyn- 
thetic food might taste like. He had 
been discovered, and angrily 
whipped and locked in his room. 
He remembered wiping away the 
tears, alone in his room, smarting 
with humiliation, and vowing he 
would show them, he would show 
them all; he would grow up to be 
so powerful he could have anything 
he wanted, and everybody would 



40 




be afraid of him. 

He looked now at Nanae, who 
had put an arm around each of 
the children, cradling them to her. 
His anger left him completely. Re- 
membering the hurt child he had 
once been, he foimd himself long- 
ing for the touch of softness and 
kindness that had never come to 
him, wishing that even now for a 
moment he could take the chil- 
dren’s place — lay his head against 
her breast, and feel her fold him in 
and brush her hand through his 
hair. He felt something melting in- 
side of him. He could feel the lines 
of his face softening as he looked 
at them. 

The words stuck, but he forced 
them out. “Fm sorry.” 

“It’s all right,” said the boy. 

Leaning down, Kirk put an arm 
tentatively around each of the chil- 
dren, half-surprised at himself for 
the gesture. As he felt their small 
bodies relax against his, it seemed 
as though some deep inner tension 
began to flow out of him. He 
straightened up to find Nanae’s 
glance on him surprisingly warm, 
almost tender. The approval in her 
eyes filled him with an unfamiliar 
kind of happiness. 

“You mean Ross spent five years 
here!” Kirk stared in amazement 
at Cortland, sitting beside him. 

The older officer turned toward 
him, shifting his position on the 
grassy ledge to which they had 
climbed for a look at the surround- 
ing countryside. “Yes, that’s right. 
Ross was straight out of the Insti- 
tute then, had an A-1 record, and 
this place had just been discovered. 

42 



They thought then it might have 
all sorts of valuable minerals and 
things. It seemed like a great 
chance.” He shrugged. “As it 
turned out, of course, there was 
nothing, but nobody could have 
known then.” 

“They know now,” Kirk said 
shortly. He sat looking over the 
valleys beneath them, silent for a 
moment. It was discouraging to 
learn Ross had been here and had 
not turned up anything: Ross was 
capable, whatever else he might 
be, and it would take luck as well 
as work to succeed where he had 
failed. And his luck didn’t seem to 
be working out too well, he 
thought, unhappily. 

But this might throw some new 
light on why he’d been sent here. 
Maybe Ross’s reason for sending 
the Institute’s star pupil had been 
one he could never have guessed 
at the time — a gesture of sentimen- 
tality. Maybe he wanted to help 
these people with whom he had 
spent his first years as an Adminis- 
trator. Maybe he wanted to make 
up for his own failure to help lift 
their living standairds. 

He turned toward the other man. 
“Cortland, you say you’ve done a 
lot of traveling here. How about 
the rest of the planet? Are any of 
the other villages more advanced; 
are the people any dififerent?” 

Cortland laughed shortly. 
“Thinking of hiring yourself a new 
native staff? Your impatience 
about worn out bucking this one? 
Can’t say I blame you, but it’s no 
go. All these villages are the same. 
One outfit’s as bad as the next. Oh, 
they go in for different things — 

APRIL SMITH 




one will go all out for sculptures, 
one will be great on weaving, and 
another one maybe will grow a 
special kind of fruit. But the people 
are all alike — all equally charming 
and equally impossible. All sweet 
and friendly on the surface and 
stubborn as mules underneath. All 
acting like they know something 
they’re not talking about, like 
they’ve got some secret hidden be- 
hind those clear, guileless eyes of 
theirs, some source of strength that 
makes them able to tell us to go 
to hell — figuratively, of course — 
when they don’t like our orders.” 
He leaned forward, intently. “I’d 
give a lot to find out what makes 
them tick.” A look of inseciurity, 
almost of anxiety filled his eyes. 

A sudden gust of wind blew a 
flurry of leaves against Kirk’s face. 
He brushed them away, feeling 
chilled. 

Cortland blinked his eyes, and 
his face resumed its customary firm 
look. “But to get back to your ques- 
tion — this village here is supposed 
to be a center of government. When 
the Nemarians have to decide on 
anything that affects the whole 
planet, the Council in this village 
does it. The Council has nothing 
to do with the Galactic Union set- 
up, of course. It’s strictly local, was 
here before GU discovered this 
place. You probably studied up on 
it before you came here.” 

Kirk nodded. Every planet with 
an indigenous population had its 
own political set-up. It was GU 
policy not to interfere with them, 
unless their interests clashed in 
some way. 

Cortland went on. “Anyone who 

birthright 



likes being in on that sort of thing 
packs up and emigrates to this vil- 
lage. I don’t know whether you’ve 
noticed, but these people are pretty 
casual about moving from one town 
to another. Anyway, when your 
would-be politician gets here, the 
people take him in and watch him 
awhile, and then, if they like him 
all right, he’s put on the Council. 
What a system! The truth is, most 
of the Nemarians consider political 
work something of a nuisance and 
would just as soon somebody else 
did it. They don’t care for power 
the way we do. They look on it as 
just a heavy responsibility and a 
burden.” 

Kirk shifted his leg uncomforta- 
bly, feeling a bit self-conscious. 

“By the way,” Cortland added 
casually, “how are you getting on 
with that girl?” 

“What girl?” 

“That beautiful creature who 
keeps house for you.” 

“Nanae?” 

“Yes, Nanae. The beauty of the 
village, the girl who cooks break- 
fast for you, the head of the Coun- 
cil—” 

“What did you say? What was 
that about the Council?” 

“She’s head of the Council. 
Didn’t you know?” 

“How can she be? She’s a maid, 
she—” 

“They don’t have maids here. 
She’s being neighborly. And they 
have sort of a “power corrupts” 
philosophy here. If you’re in a posi- 
tion of authority, you’re sort of ex- 
pected to go out and do humble 
tasks for people once in awhile, so 
you won’t get to feeling above them. 

43 




These people like to keep everyone 
on the same low — ” 

“But head of the Council !’* Kirk 
broke in. “She’s just a young girl!” 
“So what? You’re just a young 
man.” 

“But—” 

“Sorry for the levity. But they 
let women do everything here. 
They’ve got equality of the sexes, 
old man. They — ” 

We’d better be starting back,” 
Kirk broke in. He rose to his feet. 

He walked silently down the hill 
beside Cortland, his head whirling. 



W HEN THEY reached the vil- 
lage, he left Cortland as 
quickly as he could and hurried in 
the direction of his house, incoher- 
ent thoughts tumbling over each 
other in his mind. His face burned 
as he remembered his condescen- 
sion, the way he had fought his de- 
sire for her by holding her off with 
curt remarks, indicating with raised 
eyebrows that he wished no person- 
al conversation. He thought of the 
occasional glint of amusement he 
had seen breaking through her 
serene courtesy. 

Why had she kept coming, he 
wondered. 

He saw, with a start, that he was 
nearly to his house, and he realized 
he had been hoping Nanae would 
be there. He had to talk to her, 
though he had no idea what he 
would say. As he drew closer, he 
saw a flicker of motion inside the 
porch. 

He walked forward quietly, and 
then stood a moment watching her, 
silently. She had her back to him 

44 



and was sweeping, as she had been 
that first time he saw her. Her 
thighs were wrapped in soft, violet 
cloth, and a cascade of violet flow- 
ers jeweled the lovely hair which 
rippled and swirled down her back 
and shoulders. Not a wasted mo- 
tion, he thought, not a gesture that 
isn’t beautififl. He wondered why 
he had ever felt sweeping a floor 
was a menial task. She moved like 
a great dancer. 

She turned as he watched and 
saw him. “Hello.” She smiled, and 
he felt himself tremble a little. 

“I just heard about you — about 
your being head of die Council,” 
he blurted out. “I want to apolo- 
gize; I didn’t know, I — ” 

“What difference does it make?” 
She looked genuinely puzzled. 

“I thought you were a maid, a 
... a sort of person who waits on 
other people, on Terra,” he tried 
to explain. “I didn’t know you 
were just doing this to be kind. I’ve 
been very rude. I — I hardly know 
what to say . .” 

Her eyes widened. “Do you treat 
p>eople who clean your houses on 
Terra one way and officials anoth- 
er? You are funny, you Terrans.” 

“Yes, I guess we are funny.” He 
searched for words. “This is the 
first time I’ve really talked to you, 
isn’t it?” 

She smiled. “We’ve just been 
people in the same room.” She 
spoke gently. “I’ve seen you were 
unhappy and confused under that 
roud manner. I wanted to help, 
ut you weren’t ready to let anyone 
help.” 

“Why did you keep coming?” He 
waited anxiously for her answer. 

APRIL SMITH 




“I liked you.” Her glance was 
half-tender and a little amused. 
“And I knew you wanted me here, 
even though you tried not to show 
it.” She paused. “There was anoth- 
er reason, too.” 

“What was it?” 

“You know Marlin Ross lived 
here once?” He nodded. “Well, 
there was a note from him on the 
spaceship you came on. It was ad- 
dressed to my father, asking him 
to take care of you. He and Ross 
were good friends. But my father is 
dead now, and so the letter was 
given to me.” 

“And so you’ve been taking care 
of me.” 

“Yes.” 

“But I’m sure he didn’t mean it 
literally — taking care of my house 
and fixing my food and — ” 

“No, of course not. He just meant 
to take care of you, give you what 
you needed. But you needed this. 
You needed to be waited on a lit- 
tle.” 

“I guess I did.” He could find 
nothing adequate to say, “Thank 
you.” 

There was a moment of silence. 

She put aside the broom, which 
was still poised in one hand. “Let 
me make you some jen. You look 
tired.” 

“Thank you.” Kirk sat down, 
with a deep sigh, and leaned back, 
watching her precise, exquisite 
movements, as she prepared the 
hot liquid. He found himself long- 
ing to touch her, to reach out and 
feel the soft, supple flesh, the rip- 
pling hair. The sight of her beauti- 
ful, firm breasts moving as she 
worked tortured him. The low 

birthright 



necklace that signified they were 
covered didn’t work very well for 
him, he thought. The flowers 
twined into it kept falling aside as 
she bent and turned, tantalizing 
him more. He pulled his eyes away, 
and forced himself to think of other 
things. 

She had been very kind, he 
realized. 

She hadn’t made him feel like a 
fool. 



H e stood waiting for the last 
of the staff to assemble, letting 
the feel of triumph course through 
his body. He felt heady, exultant, 
a little drunk with joy. This was 
his moment. This made it all worth 
while — the long hours, the sleep- 
less nights, the relentless work, the 
struggle. They would see. They 
would see he hadn’t been driving 
himself and them for nothing. 

He stared down for a moment at 
the piece of ore which he had 
brought to show them. It contained 
unpolished zenites. 

Nemar possessed zenites, the fab- 
ulous gems valued all over the gal- 
axy for their shimmering, glowing 
beauty of changing color. Infinitely 
more precious and rare than dia- 
monds, they served often as a ga- 
lactic medium of exchange, where 
weight was important. A handful of 
them could be worth the whole 
cargo of a trading ship. 

He was not surprised that no one 
had found the ore deposits before. 
They were the products of immense 
and peculiar pressures and no ap- 
preciable amount of the ore was 
ever found except very deep under- 

45 




ground. He was very glad now he 
had specialized in geology and 
minerology instead of social struc- 
ture and alien psychology. Other- 
wise, the geologic reports he had re- 
ceived of the area would have 
seemed perfectly routine and or- 
dinary. The nagging feeling that 
there was something a little unusual 
about the soil analysis would never 
have come into consciousness as a 
definite, tremulous hunch. 

He could have sent Cortland or 
one of the others out there with the 
tools and instruments to dig and 
make test after test, searching sev- 
eral feet under the surface for the 
elusive end-trail of a lode. But he 
had wanted to go himself. He had 
packed and prepared for the two- 
day trip, steeling himself against 
the disappointment he was almost 
sure to receive. 

He looked at the faces of his 
staff* members, all present now, 
thinking of that first meeting with 
them and the peculiar reception his 
plans had received. Now it would 
be different: now everything he had 
asked of them was justified. 

Drawing a long breath, he began 
to tell them what had happened. 

As he went on, his fiery enthu- 
siasm began to waver. His voice 
boomed too loudly in the quiet 
room. Once or twice his words fal- 
tered, as he glanced at the dispas- 
sionate face of a native. As he 
finished, he looked around, a sense 
of dismay and fear creeping into 
his feeling of triumph. 

They had listened too quietly. 
Only Cortland and a few other 
Terrans had shown any indication 
of the excitement and jubilation he 

46 



expected. The others seemed un- 
impressed and imdistiurbed. With a 
sinldng feeling in the pit of his 
stomach, he called for discussion. 

There was a pause. Finally, one 
of the older Nemarians spoke. “This 
is a very important matter. If these 
mines are put into operation, it will 
affect the lives of everyone on Ne- 
mar. I must ask that you give us a 
little time to tliink over the im- 
plications.” 

He spoke courteously, but Kirk 
knew the request would have to be 
respected. He wanted to shout at 
them, to ask them to understand 
this wonderful thing that had hap- 
pened, to tell them they were going 
to be rich! But this was the way 
they did things, and tliis was the 
way it would have to be done. He 
pushed down the impatience burn- 
ing in him. “Will a day do?” 

The Nemarian hesitated a mo- 
ment, then nodded. “Very well. A 
day should be enough.” 

fCirk watched them file out a few 
minutes later. He wondered where 
his sense of elation had gone. 

Apprehension filled him again as 
he watched the staff assemble die 
next morning. The faces of the 
Nemarian members increased his 
discomfort. Why didn’t they look 
happier, more excited? Why should 
they look at him with that un- 
spoken sympathy in their eyes. He 
was afraid to hear what they had to 
say. 

The native who had spoken the 
day before moved forward a little. 
“We’re very sorry,” he said gently. 
Kirk felt his heart sinking. “We 
realize that you have worked very 

APRIL SMITH 




hard in what you consider to be 
our interests. We hoped you would 
come up with something more ac- 
ceptable than these mines. But we 
cannot put the plans for mining 
these gems of yours into operation. 
We are very sorry,” he said again, 
“but the Council has voted against 
it.” 

“The Council!” Kirk stared at 
him. He fought to control his voice. 
“You know perfectly well that the 
power of my command is supreme 
over any local councils of whatever 
natime.” He stiffened. “But that 
isn’t the point. I guess I haven’t 
made things clear to you somehow. 
These gems — ^which you refer to as 
if they were a child’s baubles — can 
make this insignificant planet a 
power in the galaxy. They can 
make the name of Nemar respected 
throughout the whole Galactic 
Union. You can trade them.” He 
spoke each word slowly and care- 
fully as if he were explaining to a 
child. “I’m not haying expensive 
machinery constructed and sending 
you down hundreds of feet into the 
ground so that your women can 
wear these jewels. They’re extreme- 
ly pretty, but you probably feel the 
flowers the girls pluck and put in 
their hair do just as well for orna- 
ments, and perhaps you’re right.” 

He paused, trying to hold on to 
his temper. “It will be dark and 
dusty and uncomfortable down in 
those mines, as I told you yesterday 
when you asked about it. It will be 
hard work, and I know you’re not 
fond of hard work.” He could not 
keep the sarcasm out of his voice. 
“But I assure you, it will be worth 
it. A really good specimen of one 

BIRTHRIGHT 



of these little gems (he underlined 
the word) can buy half the cargo 
of a spaceship. These jewels can 
make it worthwhile for the great 
trading ships to swarm through 
space out to this isolated fragment 
of the cosmos. You can acquire the 
technologies of other planets with 
them. The evolution of this planet 
can be speeded up a dozen times. 
You can become of importance in 
the scheme of things, leave this 
backward, primitive way of life be- 
hind you.” 

As he paused for breath, one of 
the Nemarians spoke quietly. “We 
don’t want to push ahead that fast.” 
He looked at Kirk serenely. “We 
are interested in improving con- 
ditions here, of course. We want to 
acquire things that will make our 
lives more pleasant and luxurious. 
Some day we wish to become a 
highly developed society, techno- 
logically. We wish growth and 
change — but only very slowly, very 
carefully. We want to be very, very 
sure we do not bring in pain when 
we bring in new pleasures. We 
need to study each new change to 
see what it might mean.” He 
paused. “In this case, it took very 
little study. This mining project 
would mean the young men would 
be put to backbreaking labor in un- 
derground, unhealthy conditions. 
There might be circumstances 
which could justify such a thing. 
But not for jewels which are in- 
trinsically worthless.” 

“Worthless! I just told you — 

“I mean they are not valuable in 
themselves. You can make cheap, 
synthetic jewels that are almost as 
beautiful, can’t you?” 

47 




“YeSj of course, but — ” 

“So they are only valuable be- 
cause they are rare, because you 
call them valuable, because they 
show the people who buy them 
have enough money to buy them. 
Wearing them is really a way of 
saying, Fm rich, to everyone who 
sees you.” He shrugged. “We don’t 
care about that sort of thing here.” 

Kirk clenched his fists in frustra- 
tion. Maybe he should have special- 
ized in alien psychology. He made 
another try. “I know you don’t. 
That’s not the point. The point is 
that you can trade them for other 
things, for — ” 

The older native who had an- 
nounced the Council decision broke 
in again. “As you said, the mining 
is very hard, disagreeable work. We 
feel that when you begin to do dis- 
agreeable things for an end that is 
not valuable in itself, you are be- 
ginning to tread a dangerous path. 
There is no telling where it will 
end. One such situation leads to 
another. We might end up cooped 
up in a room all day, shut away 
from the sun and air, turning bolts 
on an assembly line to make ma- 
chines, as we have heard often hap- 
pens on Terra.” He looked slightly 
shocked at the picture. “Being sur- 
rounded by technical conveniences 
isn’t worth that.” He looked at 
ELirk patiently, as though this 
should be self-evident. “On Terra 
and on most of the other planets 
we have had word of, people seem 
to spend their time making all 
kinds of things that have no value in 
themselves, because they can be 
sold or traded. Other people spend 
their time trying to persuade peo- 

48 



pie to buy these useless things. Still 
other people spend all day making 
records of how many of these thin^ 
have been sold. No! This path is 
not for us.” He shook his head. 
“We don’t know how it came about 
that all these people spend their 
time at these unpleasant, useless 
things. They can’t have wanted it 
that way. No human being could 
want to spend his time doing silly, 
pointless Aings. How could you be- 
lieve in yourself? How could you 
walk proudly? How could you ex- 
plain it to your children? We must 
be careful not to make the mistake 
of taking the first step in that di- 
rection.” 

Kirk felt hopelessly confused. 
The reasoning was all wrong, but 
how coiJd he explain it to them? 

He began slowly, from another 
angle . 



H e stood there for a long 
time after they had left, try- 
ing to control his rage. He had 
tried everything he could think of. 
He had argued, reasoned, pleaded 
with them. He had raged at them, 
threatened them. Nothing had 
worked. 

The threats had not disturbed 
them. 

He thought of sending out an 
emergency beam for help. But what 
would he say when the ship ar- 
rived : put these people under mar- 
tial law — ^force them to work — it’s 
for their own good? He’d like to 
see if they could do it, he thought. 
He’d be betting they couldn’t. 

He paced up and down, clench- 
ing his fists. 



APRIL SMITH 




He could have all the council 
members jailed, he thought. Only 
there weren’t any jails on Nemar. 

Resentment burned in him. 
They’d let him work and struggle 
and slave day and night — for this. 
He swung his fist into the wall sud- 
denly, with all his might. The pain 
stung, but he felt a little better. 

He looked at the bruised hand, 
wondering what to do. He was too 
restless to go home and stay by him- 
self, burning up with unspent rage ; 
and he certainly couldn’t go and sit 
among the natives, listening to them 
chatter and laugh. 

He decided to take a walk. 

He heard a rustle of leaves after 
he had gone a little way and saw 
a pair of feminine legs through the 
underbrush. He tried to turn aside. 
He didn’t feel like talking to Jean- 
nette now. 

But she had already seen him. 
“Hello, there,” she said, pushing 
aside a branch from where she was 
sitting. “Are you taking a walk, 
too? Thought you were always 
sticking to the old grindstone this 
time of day.” 

“Hello, Jeannette.” 

“Sit down and rest for a minute. 
I need some company.” 

He hesitated, then sat down re- 
luctantly. 

“You don’t look too cheerful,” 
she said, looking at him. “Some- 
thing eating you?” 

“Just this place,” he said wearily. 
“And the people.” 

“Yes, it gets you after a while, 
doesn’t it? It’s pretty hard to take.” 
He leaned against a tree and 
tried to relax. 

“It’s hard to live with,” she went

on, “the constant sense of inferi- 
ority . .” 

He wondered if he had heard her 
correctly. “What did you say?” 

“I said, it’s hard to live with.” 
“No, no. I meant the last part.” 
“The constant sense of inferi- 
ority. Is something the ma — ” 
“What are you talking about?” 
“I’m talking about the Nemar- 
ians, naturally.” 

“You surely don’t consider them 
superior to us!” he said incred- 
ulously. 

“Let’s not fool ourselves,” she 
said. “There isn’t one of them that 
isn’t superior to every Terran here.” 
He stared at her. 

“Of course, we do fool ourselves. 
I’ve been doing it a long time. Or 
trying to, anyway. But I’ve been 
sitting here thinking. Among other 
things, about why I didn’t leave 
on that ship you came on, as I’d 
planned.” 

“Why didn’t you?” he asked. 

The same reason nobody else 
did, but Jerwyn; and he had to.” 
“Plenty of them don’t like it 
here,” he said. “There’s plenty of 
griping.” 

“Not really,” she said. “It’s not 
really griping. It’s just a way of 
making yourself feel better. Only 
the ones who haven’t been here too 
long do it, and one or two others 
who are real old-line die-hards, like 
your Mr. Cortland. 

“Why didn’t you leave?” 
“Because this is a good deal, of 
course. The climate’s lovely; the 
scenery’s beautiful; life is sort of 
a perpetual pleasure outing. The 
only trouble is, you’re always on the 
fringes- You’re the kid from across 

49 




the tracks.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“That wasn’t the right phrase, 
because that implies snobbishness, 
and they’re not snobbish. But they 
don’t quite accept you. They let 
you hang around; they let you play 
with them. But you’re not really 
one of them.” 

“Why on earth should you want 
to be one of them! They’re just 
a bunch of ignorant primitives, 
while we come from the highest 
center of culture civilization has 
ever attained.” 

“Yes, yes, I know all that. We’re 
very good at pushing buttons and 
keeping in the right traffic lanes. 
But let’s look the facts in the face. 
I’ve been sitting here making my- 
self look the facts in the face. Have 
you ever seen one of them act 
mean?” 

“Well, not mean exactly, but — ” 
“No, you haven’t. They can get 
plenty angry, but they don’t get 
mean. There’s a difference.” 

He said nothing. 

“Have you ever seen a child here 
tear the wings off an insect?” She 
went on, not waiting for his reply. 
“No, you haven’t. And you won’t. 
Have you ever seen a native with a 
hard, cruel face? No, again. Have 
you ever seen one that wasn’t 
gentle with children?” 

“I guess not. I never thought 
about it.” 

She turned to him with an odd 
tremulousness in her face, replacing 
her usual cynical look and slightly 
raised eyebrows. “They love their 
children here. They really love 
them.” She looked at him. “They 
don’t scey they love them and then

hit them and humiliate them be- 
cause they accidentally break the 
vase Aunt Matilda gave the family 
for Christmas. Their child’s happi- 
ness means more to them than any 
vase, than any material object. 
They never humiliate their chil- 
dren. That’s why they grow up to 
walk like kings and queens. 

“They grow up being loved,” 
she said. “They all love each other. 
And it isn’t because they try. They 
don’t try to be good and nice and 
love their fellow-men, like we do. 
It’s just something that flows out 
of them. They’re full of wsirmth in- 
side, and it flows out. 

“And something else — ” she went 
on. “Have you ever caught one in 
a lie?” 

“No, but that doesn’t mean — ” 

“People like your Mr. Cortland 
think they’re sly and deceptive be- 
cause they’re always courteous, and 
still you can’t push them around. 
But he’s wrong. They’re courteous 
because they’re sorry for us, not be- 
cause they’re afraid of us.” 

“Sorry for us?” 

“Yes, sorry for us. They’re sorry 
for us because we don’t know how 
to enjoy life, because we worry 
about all sorts of things that don’t 
matter, and knock ourselves out 
working, and need other people to 
reassure us of our own worth. Be- 
cause we have bad tempers and 
awkward bodies, and we don’t have 
that warmth inside of us flowing 
out toward other people. 

“Even toward us,” she said. 
“They’re kind to us. They’re toler- 
ant. They want us to happy. 
And they do accept us eventually. 
If we stay here enough years. If we

change. Maybe not quite as one of 
them, but silmost. Sometimes they 
even marry us.” 

Kirk shook his head, trying to 
clear it. “I can’t think. I feel con- 
fused, I — ” 

“Still thinking about our great 
technological achievements? We’re 
pretty cocky about them, aren’t 
we? We come here all set to spread 
enlightenment among the savages.” 
She shrugged. “They’re not im- 
pressed with our magic machines. 
They’re not selling their planet for 
a handful of beads. They took a 
good look at us and decided to try 
to keep what they had.” 

She looked at him steadily. “Per- 
sonally, I’ve decided I can do with- 
out the vidar-shows. I’m going to 
stay and try to make the grade 
here. I’m going to work at be- 
coming a better human being. I’m 
tired of being flippant and smart 
and sophisticated. I’d like to be 
happy.” She paused. “Maybe a 
Nemarian will even fall in love 
with me eventually and marry me.” 

“You want to marry one of 
them!” 

“You catch on fast.” She blinked. 
“Sorry. That’s not a very good be- 
ginning. It’s going to take awhile 
to shake that flippancy.” She 
caught his eyes. “Wouldn’t you like 
to marry Nanae?” 

He didn’t answer. 

She smiled oddly. “Yes, I’d like 
to marry one of them and have 
children like theirs.” She hesitated. 
“I said once, they spoil their chil- 
dren rotten. I guess they do in a 
way, but the children turn out fine. 
We Terrans just aren’t used to chil- 
dren with a sense of their rights. 

BIRTHRIGHT 



These children overwhelm me.” 
She lowered her eyes. “You know 
how flippant I am — ^when I try it 
in their presence I feel terribly 
stupid. They make me aware of 
every affectation; their eyes are so 
clear — like a deer’s — I feel like a 
fool.” She looked at him tremulous- 
ly, defensively. “Anyway, I said that 
about their being spoiled, out of 
envy. When I first saw how their 
mothers held them — all that tender- 
ness, all that love, all that warmth 
— I envied them with a terrible bit- 
terness. It wasn’t that I had bad 
parents. Just ordinary ones, trying 
to do their best and all that.” 

“Why do you keep talking about 
children all the time? After all, it’s 
the adults who run things.” 

“The children are the adults of 
the future. It’s the way they’re 
brought up that makes these people 
what they are. You and I — all of us 
from Terra — we’ve been brought 
up on a limited, scientifically reg- 
imented, controlled amount of love. 
These natives have something we’ll 
never have. We’ve got to work and 
strive for what comes as naturally 
to them as breathing.” 

As' she spoke, Kirk suddenly re- 
membered the close-packed faces 
of Terrans speeding by in the op- 
posite direction on the moving side- 
walks at home — tense faces, hard 
faces, resigned faces, sad faces, tim- 
id faces, worried faces. Maybe one 
in fifty serene and self-confident, 
maybe one in a hundred vibrantly, 
joyously alive. Maybe. Probably not 
that many. 

He thought of the faces of the 
Nemarians. 

Jeannette was still talking. “They 

51 




arc what human beings should be,” 
she said slowly. “Somehow theyVe 
kept their birthright — the ability to 
be full of the joy of living when- 
ever they’re not in real trouble or 
sorrow, the ability to be happy just 
because they’re alive. I haven’t un- 
derstood these people because I 
didn’t want to understand them. 
I didn’t want to see that they were 
better than I am. They’re very 
simple, really; it’s we who are com- 
plicated and devious.” 

^‘Why hasn’t anybody ever heard 
of this place?” Kirk asked. 

“It’s isolated,” she said, “and 
people don’t leave here, once 
they’ve seen what’s here. They 
don’t write too much, either, be- 
cause by the time the spaceship 
arrives again, they understand. 
They cooperate with the author- 
ities, who are trying to keep this 
place as much of a secret as pos- 
sible. Publicize it, and within ten 
years it would be swarming with 
wealthy businessmen on vacation 
and jaded neurotics trying to get 
away from it all. The Nemarians 
would be lost in the shuffle.” 

She was still a moment. “My 
husband came here to get away 
from it all. He heard rumors of 
this place a long way off and traced 
them. I didn’t want to come. I 
liked cities and night-clubs; I liked 
being surrounded by amiable, 
promiscuous men. He dragged me 
here against my will. Now he’s 
dead, and I’m caught up in his 
dreams. These people are irresist- 
ible; they call out to something 
basic and deep in you, and you 
respond to it whether you want to 
or not. You can’t leave this place 



— unless you have to. like you 
will.” 

Kirk stood up abruptly. “Jean- 
nette, do you mind? I feel terribly 
confused. A lot has happened to 
me today. I want to walk alone 
awhile and think things out.” 

She nodded, with a sudden look 
of compassion. 



H e walked away from her 
slowly, turning half uncon- 
sciously in the direction of his 
house. His mind was a swirl of con- 
fusion. He tried to think. He 
needed to get it all straightened 
out. 

The sense of inferiority, she’d 
said, the constant sense of inferi- 
ority. Let’s not fool ourselves, she’d 
said. There isn’t one of them that 
isn’t superior to every Terran here. 

And he’d just sat there, stupefied, 
not denying it. 

Because once it was spoken, put 
into words, it had a certain right- 
ness. A certain obviousness. He’d 
known it all the time. 

He hadn’t let himself know it, 
though. He’d struggled against it, 
choking it back when it started 
seeping up from his unconscious. 
He’d worked so hard and kept him- 
self so busy and exhausted he didn’t 
have time to think. He’d thought so 
hard about other things he didn’t 
have time to think about the truth. 

He’d arrived here looking for the 
answer to a mystery. Thinking may- 
be the planet had a secret value, 
hoping maybe it held an explosive 
or new weapon that was classified 
as Super Top Secret, wondering 
if maybe it weren’t really primitive. 



52 




And nobody could have told 
him: it does have a secret value — 
secret because you’re too blind to 
see it. Nobody could have told him ; 
these people are more advanced 
than you are. Because advanced 
meant machines. Advanced didn’t 
mean happy, loving, graceful, cou- 
rageous, honest. 

They couldn’t have told him 
with words if he couldn’t see it 
with his eyes — ^if he couldn’t see 
that the glowing faces of the na- 
tives held a secret worth learning. 

The only secret that really mat- 
tered. 

How to be happy. 

Nanae was there waiting when 
he reached the house, as though 
she had been expecting him. 

She looked at him silently, then 
smiled. “You’re not angry?” 

“Angry?” 

“About the Council decision.” 

“Oh— oh, I was. I’m all mixed 
up now. I’ve been doing some 
thinking.” 

She looked at him intently, then 
nodded slowly. “Do you know why 
you were sent here?” she asked. 

“I’m just beginning to get a glim- 
mering of it.” 

“Did you know we are the only 
planet yet discovered whose people 
have never known war?” 

“No, I didn’t know.” 

“Ross came to Nemar when the 
Galactic Union first discovered it. 
He didn’t find any of the things he 
was looking for, but he did dis- 
cover something else, a way of life.” 
She paused. “Have you ever gone 
over his record?” 

“No.” 



“You should, sometime. He’s 
done a great deal of good.” She 
looked at him steadily, her eyes 
clear and soft. “He keeps sending 
the very best of the Institute grad- 
uates here, hoping they’ll study our 
society and work out some theories 
about what makes us the way we 
are. He hopes some of the happi- 
ness here can be transplanted. 

“We don’t know why we’re the 
way we are. We don’t even know 
how it’s possible to be any other 
way, and we don’t understand why 
anyone should be willing to fight 
wars, or why they should lie or hit 
their children or make long 
speeches that don’t say anything.” 

Kirk was silent. 

“We’re inside the problem,” she 
said. “We can’t see ourselves from 
the outside.” 

Kirk spoke very slowly, thinking 
it out. “You mean, Ross sent me 
here to study you, to try to find out 
what factors are involved in — 

“Yes. He sent you here to learn.” 

He was quiet, digesting that. 

“One day you’ll be in Ross’s 
place,” she said. 

He accepted the words quietly, 
knowing it was true. 

Yesterday, that would have 
seemed like the most desirable thing 
in the universe, the height of hap- 
piness. 

It seemed like a long time ago. 

It meant nothing now but a 
heavy burden. 

He sat thinking of Nanae after 
she had gone, of how he had 
longed to put his arms around her 
and draw her to him, kiss the soft 
mouth, run his hands through the 
long, glowing strands of hair.

WORTH CITING 

RECENT STATISTICS compiled by the United States Depart- 
ment of Labor have shown that it costs American industry about 
$2,500,000,000 each year for research which enables it to give 
you deadlier insecticides, better weed killers, more efficient and 
smoother-riding cars, more rugged home appliances, better surgi- 
cal instruments, more sensitive radio and television sets and the 
host of other newer developments that are easing the burden of 
life for the men and women of today. Add to this another 
$1,250,000,000 for research in the development of better planes 
for your son in the Air Force, or warmer uniforms for the boys 
in the Army, or better life rafts for the sailor and his buddies, or 
safer landing craft for the Marines. The bill adds up to the 
staggering total of $3,750,000,000 a year just to keep American 
life improving! 

It takes 96,000 research engineers and scientists laboring over 
test tubes and slide rules, blue prints and calculators, weather 
instruments and cyclotrons to produce these gimmicks and 
gadgets. And industry gets the utmost from these researchers 
by supplying them with a staff of technicians. About 143,000 
supporting workers are busily engaged in twirling knobs, taking 
hourly readings and running series of long, routine tests. In short, 
research in this country is a big and costly business. And the 
organizational technique is such that it can help the country over 
industrial humps and bottlenecks created by war, famine, plague 
and cataclysm. 

Our Citation this month goes to the researchers, those men and 
women of American industry, who conceive and make the ma- 
chines and instruments and products that make the standard of 
living in this country the finest in the world.

They were used to retarded life forms, but this was the worst. 



Yet it is a missionary's duty to bring light where there is none. 



for who can tell what deviotis forms evolution might take? 



the ethicators 



T he missionaries came out 

of the planetary system of a 
star they didn’t call Antares. They 
called it, naturally enough, The 
Sun — ^just as home was Earth, Ter- 
ra, or simply The World. And 
naturally enough, being the ascend- 
ant animal on Earth, they called 
themselves human beings. They 
were looking for extraterrestrial 
souls to save. 

They had no real hope of find- 
ing humans like themselves in this 
wonderously diversified universe. 
But it wasn’t against all probability 
that, in their rumaging, there 



might not be a humanoid species 
to whom they could reach down a 
helping paw; some emergent cous- 
in with at least a rudimentary sym- 
metry from snout to tail, and 
hence a rudimentary soul. 

The ship they chose was a com- 
pact scout, vaguely resembling the 
outside of an orange crate — except 
that they had no concept of an 
orange crate and, being a tesseract, 
it had no particular outside. It was 
simply an expanding cube (and as 
such, quite roomy) whose “interi- 
or” was always paralleling its “ex- 
terior” (or attempting to), in ac- 



55 




cordance with all the well-known, 
basic and irrefutable laws on the 
subject. 

A number of its sides occupied 
the same place at the same time, 
giving a hypothetical spectator the 
illusion of looking down merging 
sets of rsdlway tracks*. This, in fact, 
was its precise method of locomo- 
tion. The inner cube was always 
having to catch up, caboose-fash- 
ion, with the outer one in time (or 
space, depending on one’s perspec- 
tive) . And whenever it had done 
so, it would have arrived with it- 
self — at approximately wherever in 
the space-time continuum it had 
been pointed. 

When they felt the jar of the 
settling geodesics, the crew crowded 
at the forward visiplate to see where 
they were. It was the outskirts of a 
G type star system. Silently they 
watched the innermost planet float 
past, scorched and craggy, its sun- 
ward side seeming about to relapse 
to a molten state. 

The Bosun-Colonel turned to the 
Conductor. “A bit of a disappoint- 
ment I’m afraid, sir. Surely with 
all that heat . .?” 

“Steady, lad. The last wicket’s 
not been bowled.” The Conductor’s 
whiskers quivered in amusement at 
his next-in-command’s impetuosity. 
“You’ll notice that we’re dropping 
downward. If the temperature ac- 
cordingly continues dropping — ” 

He couldn’t shrug, he wasn’t 
physiologically capable of it, but 
it was apparent that he felt they’d 
soon reach a planet whose climate 
could support intelligent life. 

If the Bosun-Colonel had any 
ideas that such directions as up 

56 



and down were meaningless in 
space, he kept them to himself. As 
the second planet from its sun hove 
into view, he switched on the mag- 
niscan eagerly. 

“I say, this is more like it. Clouds 
and all that sort of thing. Should 
we have a go at it, sir?” 

The Conductor yawned. “Too 
bloody cloudy for my taste. Too 
equivocal. Let’s push on,” he said 
languidly. “I have a hunch the 
third planet might be just our dish 
of tea.” 

Quelling his disappointment, the 
Bosun-Colonel waited for the third 
planet to swim into being. And 
when it did, blooming like an or- 
chid in all its greens and moist- 
nesses, he could scarcely contain 
his excitement. 

“Why, it looks just like Earth,” 
he marveled. “Gad, sir, what a 
master stroke of navigation. How 
did you realize this would be it?” 

“Oh, I don’t know,” the Con- 
ductor said modestly. “Things 
usually have a habit of occurring in 
threes. I’m quite a student of nu- 
merology, you know.” Then he re- 
membered the Mission and drew 
himself erect on all his legs. “You 
may prepare for landing. Mister,” 
he ordered crisply. 

The Bosun-Colonel shifted over 
to manual and busied himself at 
the helm, luffing the square craft 
down the troughs of air. Gliding 
over the vast tropical oceans, he 
put down at a large land mass 
above a shallow warm sea, twenty- 
five degrees below the northern 
pole. 

Too numbed for comment, the 
crew stared out at the alien vista. 



WILLARD MARSH 




They’d heard of retarded life 
forms from other Missionary ex- 
peditions — of planets where the in- 
habitants, in extreme emergency, 
had been known to commit mur- 
der. But this was surely the worst, 
the most vicious imaginable in the 
galaxy. 

Here, with life freshly up from 
the sea, freshly launched on the 
long climb to maturity and self- 
realization — was nothing but hor- 
ror. With so lush a vegetation, so 
easily capable of supporting them 
side by side in abundance, the 
monsters were actually feeding on 
each other. Great lumbering beasts 
they were with their bristling hides 
and huge tails, charging between 
the giant tree ferns; gouging living 
chunks from one another while 
razor-toothed birds with scaly wings 
flapped overhead, screaming for 
the remnants. As the sounds of 
carnage came through the audio 
ports, the youngest Oarsman 
keeled over in a faint. 

Even the Conductor was visibly 
shaken. The Bosun-Colonel turned 
to him with a sick expression. 

“Surely it’s a lost cause. Skipper. 
Life like this will never have a 
soul worth saving.” 

“Not in its present stage,” the 
Old Man was forced to agree. 
“Still, one never knows the devious 
paths that evolution takes.” He 
considered the scene for a thought- 
ful, shuddering interval. “Perhaps 
in several thousand millen- 
niums . .” 

The Bosun-Colonel tried to vis- 
ualize the possibility of Ethical Life 
ever materializing through these 
swamp mists, but the logic against 

THE ETHICATORS 



it was too insurmoimtable for the 
imagination. 

“Even so,” he conceded, “grant- 
ing the impossible — whatever shape 
it took, the only worthwhile species 
would still be . .” He couldn’t 
bring himself to say it. 

“Meat-eaters,” the Conductor 
supplied grimly. 

C3n hearing this, the Oarsman 
who had just revived promptly 
fainted again. 

“It’s too deep in the genes,” the 
Conductor continued, “too far ad- 
vanced for us to tamper with. All 
we can hope to do is modify their 
moral outlook. So that by the time 
they achieve star travel, they’ll at 
least have a basic sense of Fair 
Play.”

incommensurate with his chrono- 
logical youth, he gave the order 
wearily. It was snapped down the 
chain of command to the Senior 
Yardbird: 

“All paws stand by to lower the 
Ethics Ray! Step lively, lads — bug- 
ger off, now ...” 

There was a din of activity as 
the outer locks were opened and 
the bulky mechanism was shipped 
over the side. It squatted on a 
cleared rise of ground in all its 
complex, softly ticking majesty, 
waiting for the First Human to pad 
within range of its shedding Grace 
and Uplift. The work party scram- 
bled back to the ship, anxious to be 
off this sinister terrain. Once more 
the crew gathered at the visiplate 
as the planet fell away beneath 
them, the Ethics Ray winking in 
the day’s last light like a corner- 
stone. Or perhaps a tambourine . 



IGHT CLOSED down on the 
raw chaotic world, huge beasts 
closed in on the strange star-fallen 
souvenir. They snuffled over it; 
then enraged at discovering it was 
nothing they could fill their clam- 
oring mindless stomachs with, at- 
tempted to wreck it. They were un- 
successful, for the Machine had 
been given an extra heavy coat of 
shellac and things to withstand 
such monkeyshines. And the Ma- 
chine, in its own finely calibrated 
way, ignored its harassers, for they 
had no resemblance to the Life it 
had been tuned to influence. 

Days lengthened into decades, 
eons. The seas came shouldering in 
to stand towers tall above the 

58 



Ethics Ray, lost in the far ooze 
below. Then even the seas receded, 
and the mountains buckled up- 
ward in their place, their arrogant 
stone faces staring changelessly 
across the epochs. Until they too 
were whittled down by erosion. The 
ice caps crept down, crackling and 
grinding the valleys. The groimd 
stretched and tossed like a restless 
sleeper, settled, and the Ethics Ray 
was brought to light once more. 

As it always had, it continued 
beaming its particular signal, on a 
cosmic ray carrier modulated by 
a pulse a particular number of 
angstroms below infrared. The 
beasts that blundered within its 
field were entirely different now, 
but they still weren’t the Right 
Ones. Among them were some 
shambling pale bipeds, dressed in 
skins of other beasts, who clucked 
over its gleaming exterior and tried 
to chip it away for spearheads. In 
this of course they were unsuccess- 
ful. 

And then one day the First Hu- 
man wandered by, paused square 
in the path of the beam. His phy- 
siology was only approximate, his 
I.Q. was regrettably low — but he 
was Pre-Moral Life, such as it was, 
on this planet. 

The Ethics Ray made the neces- 
sary frequency adjustments, tripped 
on full force. The Primitive froze 
under the bombardment, its germ

His congratulations were unre-

“A splendid mission, lad,” he 
said, “and I don’t mind suggesting

The Conductor was over-

through a desk drawer. “Bothera-

“With pleasure.” The Conductor 
handed over his monogrammed

BLEEDBACK 



BY WINSTON MARKS 



It was just a harmless^ though amazing^ kid^s toy that sold for 



less than a dollar. Yet it plunged the entire nation 



into a nightmare of mystery and chaos . 



T he thing is over now, but I 
can’t see a Teddy bear or a 
set of blocks in a department store 
window without shuddering. I’m 
thankful I’m a bachelor and have 
no children around to remind me 
of the utterly insane nightmare that 
a child’s toy plunged our country 
into — the millions of people who 
died in agony — the total disruption 
and near dissolution of our nation. 

And yet, as the United States tot- 
tered on the verge of complete 



chaos, it was, ironically, another 
child’s toy that saved us. A simple, 
ordinary, every-day toy for tots 
stopped the “fever”, halted the 
carnage that was tearing our flesh 
and eyes and viscera into shreds. 
With most the scientists in the 
world working for an emergency 
solution, they could come up with 
no better answer than a toy that’d 
been around for generations before 
the “Mystery i-Gun” was even con- 
ceived.

Being a plain-clothesman, I have 
seen greed and impatience ruin 
many individual lives. If I could 
have guessed at the chain of events 
that would stem from my first 
tact with the younger Baxter 
er, I would have put a bullet 
through his head in cold blood and 
cheerfully faced the gas chamber.

Instead I took off my hat and fol- told, we would find a body, 
lowed him through the substantial Leo Baxter was a little guy about 
old house to a moderately large five-foot six, like me but with a 



room in the rear where, I’d been better build. His size was important 



61 




for a couple of reasons, one being 
that it was startling to say the least, 
when he pointed to the giant on the 
floor and said, “My brother.” 

He caught my look and shrugged 
impatiently. “I know, I know, but 
this is no time for Mutt and Jeff 
gags. Galvin has been murdered. 
Now get with it, Lieutenant!” If 
Galvin was his brother, Leo’s agita- 
tion was understandable, but his 
voice had a flat note of practicality 
in it that I didn’t like. 

As I looked down at the sprawled 
length of the big man on the tiled 
floor, the Mutt and Jeff angle 
didn’t fit at all. David and Goliath 
was a better bet. This Goliath 
seemed also to have met his fate 
from a hole in the forehead. I say, 
“seemed,” because it developed that 
Galvin Baxter was not yet quite 
dead. 

“There’s no pulse or breath,” his 
brother said when I mentioned this 
error in his assumption. 

“You’re no doctor. Now call that 
ambulance like I told you. Jump!” 
I said. 

He jumped. I made a quick ex- 
amination, meanwhile, and when 
Leo came back from the phone I 
pointed. “See, the blood. It’s still 
coming out.” 

“Gorpses bleed, don’t they?” 

“Not in spurts,” I said. “The 
hole’s tiny, but whatever’s in there 
touched an artery. See that?” 

He looked and seemed convinced. 
“The ambulance will be here. Any- 
thing else I should do?” 

“Yes. Nothing. Don’t touch a 
thing in this room ... or did you 
already?” 

“Just Galvin. I heard him fall, 

62 



and when I came in he was on his 
face.” 

“Why did you ask for homicide 
when you called the police? Or 
let’s put it this way: What makes 
you think it wasn’t an accident?” 

“Two reasons. First, because I 
couldn’t see any cause of the acci- 
dent. When I turned him over the 
floor was smooth and clean under 
his forehead except for the smear 
of blood. Reason number two: Be- 
cause Galvin just doesn’t have ac- 
cidents. All his life he’s moved in 
slow motion. I’ve never known him 
to stumble, or cut himself, or drop 
anything or even bump into any- 
one.” 

I was checking around the room 
myself, and I had to admit that 
both reasons might be valid. A man 
the size of Galvin wasn’t likely to 
be the skittish type. And by the 
time the ambulance arrived I was 
ready to admit that if the injury 
were an accident, Galvin Baxter 
had contrived to conceal its source. 

It took several of us to load the 
unconscious man onto the stretcher. 
I told his cocky little brother to stay 
on ice, while I rode downtown in 
the ambulance. 

Dr. Thorsen called me into the 
emergency ward. “How did this 
happen?” he wanted to know. 
Thorsen is a lean, learned old chap 
who normally gives more answers 
than he asks. 

I said, “Don’t know. Doc. I 
found him in a sort of home work- 
shop. No power tools, nothing dan- 
gerous in sight. The bench at one 
end had a couple of little gadgets 
on it — looked sort of electrical. 
Some wire, soldering iron, books, a 

WINSTON AAARKS 




few rough circuit drawings.” 

“The gadgets. What did they 
look like?” 

1 thought back and realized that 
what I had to describe would sound 
a little peculiar. “Sort of like flash- 
lights with a pistol grip . and no 
lens where the light should come 
out. Just blunt, flat ends. 

Thorsen shrugged. “Then I don’t 
know. I expected you to report 
some kind of a blast or explosion.” 
“No sign of one.” 

“All right, then what else but a 
flying particle could drill a hole in 
a man’s forehead the diameter of a 
piece of 16-gauge wire?” 

“What do the x-rays show?” 
“We’ll know in a minute. What 
about the murder-attempt angle?” 
I said that I had nothing to go on 
yet. That was the whole truth and 
the final truth! 

When Doc’s x-rays revealed 
nothing but a blood clot deep in the 
brain at the end of the tiny tunnel 
piercing the skull, I was left with- 
out even a “modus operandi”, let 
alone a substantial suspect. 



F or two days I investigated 
brother Leo, and when I wasn’t 
investigating him I was question- 
ing him. The small town in Min- 
nesota where he claimed he and 
his brother were bom had been the 
county seat, and the whole shivaree 
had burned up in a prairie fire 
years ago, courthouse, birth rec- 
ords and all. With no other living 
relatives, I had to depend on peo- 
ple who had known both men. 
From those whom I questioned, I 
ascertained that they had been 



passing for brothers, at least, for 
some time. 

On the third day Leo’s patience 
began to crack. “You keep asking 
me the same, stupid questions over 
and over. I tell you, I’m a mechan- 
ical engineer. My brother was a 
mathematician. We’re both single. 
I make enough money in the con- 
struction game to support both of 
us. What’s so suspicious about hu- 
moring my brother’s research?” 

“Among other things,” I said, “is 
your ignorance of what he was 
doing.” 

“For the fiftieth time I tell you 
I didn^t know!” His exasperation 
was mounting to the pitch I had 
been awaiting. 

“You used the past tense. You 
do know now?” 

He wheeled and crosstd the 
living room, poured himself a drink 
of straight bourbon and downed it. 
“Yes, I have a notion now, but it’s 
none of your damned business. His 
ideas may be patentable.” 

I said slowly and quietly, “Now 
I’ll tell you what I’ve been waiting 
for. I’ve been waiting for you to 
offer me information about the two 
little gadgets that you removed 
from your brother’s work-bench — 
against my explicit orders not to 
touch anything. Until you produce 
those items and explain your ac- 
tions I’ll be around here asking 
stupid questions. From now on, un- 
derstand?” 

“Damn cops!” He threw the shot 
glass to the floor and glared at me 
for a long minute. “All right, come 
with me.” 

We went into a little library. He 
took two volumes from a high shelf 



BLEEDBACK 



63 




and from the recess snatched the 
two gadgets with the pistol ^ips. 

From a table drawer, whicn he 
unlocked with a key from his 
pocket, he took some drawings that 
looked like the ones that had dis- 
appeared from his brother’s little 
work-shop. 

“Calvin developed a new effect 
by applying one of his esoteric 
mathematical symbols to a simple 
electronic circuit,” Leo began, in 
his surly tone. He pointed at the 
margin of the circuit drawing. 
There were jottings of algebraic 
formulae in which the quantity “i” 
appeared prominently. He pointed 
this out to me and continued, 
“Being a cop you wouldn’t under- 
stand, but this symbol stands for an 
imaginary number, the square root 
of a minus one.” 

This rang a bell from away back 
in my own college math. I said, 
“Yeah, I think I remember. It’s 
some sort of operational factor in 
polar coordinates. No real meaning 
in itself, but — ” 

“Well! An educated cop! That’s 
right, except that Calvin managed 
to give this symbol an actual, func- 
tional application. I was telling the 
truth when I said I didn’t ^ow 
what he was doing. I still don’t un- 
derstand it, and I’ve been losing 
sleep over these formulae.” 

“Then why not take it to the 
university and let the professors — ” 

“Because,” he interrupted, 
“whether I understand it or not, 
Calvin’s gadget, happens to work. 
Watch this.” 

He picked an ordinary paper clip 
from the debris of pencils, stamps 
and rubber bands from the top desk 



drawers, touched it to the “muzzle” 
end of the gadget where it stuck as 
if magnetized. “Now keep your 
eyes on the paper clip,” he ordered. 

His forefinger pressed a button 
in the pistol grip, and without 
click, snap, buzz or murmur, the 
paper clip disappeared. 

Leo stared at me, as thoughts of 
“hyper-space”, fourth-dimension 
and space-warps flitted through my 
mind. It wasn’t a Buck Roger’s 
atomic disintegrator, because there 
was no heat, flash or sound. The 
clip was suddenly elsewhere. 

“And I suppose the other gadget 
brings it back,” I said. 

“That’s what I thought, but I 
can’t make it work. I suppose my 
brother could, if he were here.” 

He tossed the thing to me, 
pointed at the little box of paper 
clips in the drawer and said, “Have 
fun.” 

I did, for about five minutes. 
Eight paper clips later I was con- 
vinced that whatever else it might 
be, the gadget was no potential 
murder weapon. The clips dis- 
appeared, totally. You could pass 
your hand through the point of 
departure without a tingle of sensa- 
tion. 

Leo briefed me further. The 
thing worked only on metallic con- 
ductors. It was harmless to human 
flesh and other organic matter. 
Then he removed the cover that 
ran the length of the rather crude, 
hand-carved, wooden barrel. From 
front to back, were: One pen-light 
cell, a lumpy-looking coil of wire 
hand-wound on a spindle-shaped 
iron core, and a short, cylindrical 
bar-magnet.

“In mass production,” he said, 
“About 40 cents worth of material 
and maybe 50 cents worth of labor! 
Do you see why I wanted to keep 
it a secret until I could patent it?” 

“No!” I said flatly. “Unless you 
consider a paper-clip disposal unit 
an item of commerci^ impor- 
tance.” 

“But it’s a whole new scientific 
principle — the rotation of matter 
completely out of our space-time 
continuum!” 

“That much I grasp, but what 
good is it except as a demonstration 
of a piece of pure scientific re- 
search?” 

“Good Lord, man, have you no 
imagination?” 

“Okay, okay! Get rich,” I said 
and slammed the front door behind 
me as I stomped out. I had been 
so certain that the missing gadgets 
would give me a motive for the at- 
tack on Leo’s brother, or at least 
the method of inflicting the fan- 
tastic wound, that I was about 
ready to turn in my badge in frus- 
tration. All I could pin on Leo was 
a desire to cash in on his brother’s 
gimmick — ^which, presumably, he 
could have done whether Calvin 
lived or died. 

Suppose, I mused on my way 
back to the station, that Calvin had 
refused to let Leo commercialize on 
his discovery? Perhaps Calvin was 
preparing a paper for publication 
in scientific circles. Maybe cool- 
headed little Leo tried to knock off 
his brother to keep the secret in 
the family until it could be turned 
to a selfish dollar. 

All right, suppose a jury would 
accept such an impalpable theory 

BLEEDBACK 



as a motive, then what? No murder 
weapon. No witnesses. Not even a 
genuine murder yet, because Calvin 
was still alive. 

Yes, old Doc Thorsen had kept 
the mathematician alive somehow. 
The elder Baxter lay on his back 
across two, white iron beds pushed 
together in the City Hospital, and 
Thorsen came in to report to me. 

“The clot seems to be absorbing 
better than I expected, but it’s 
doubtful that we could operate to 
remove the paralyzing pressure. 
The puncture is deep into the brain 
tissue, and he’s too nearly gone to 
survive such an ordeal.” 

“Any chance that he might re- 
cover consciousness?” 

“Pretty remote,” Thorsen told 
me. “We’ll keep a special nurse 
with him as you ordered, just in 
case he does.” 

I left Calvin Baxter pale and 
motionless as some great statue 
supine amid the tangle of plasma, 
glucose and saline hoses, under his 
transparent oxygen tent. The 
wound that had laid him low was 
no more than a dot of dried blood 
on his massive forehead. 

Until his death, his file would re- 
main under unsolved crimes. In 
my own mind I was no longer sure 
of anything, except that if there 
was a nickel in Calvin Baxter’s dis- 
covery, his mercenary brother 
would wring it out. 

And he did. Even before Calvin 
died. 

Some seven weeks later Leo mar- 
keted the “MYSTERY i-GUN” as 
a combined, toy, trick and puzzle, 
and it set the whole damned world 
on its ear! 

65 




I located Leo Baxter in his new 
suite of offices on the 34th floor 
of the State Building. He peeled 
back his lips in a sneery grin. “I 
thought you’d be showing up.” 

He waved away his male secre- 
tary who was still clinging to my 
arm trying to tow me back to the 
reception room. I said, “I kept 
your secret, then you pull an irre- 
sponsible thing like this! A kid’s toy! 
Good Lord, man, that device might 
be dangerous!” 

“I appreciate your professional 
ethics, Lieutenant. I’ve applied for 
a patent, so you can tell all your 
friends now. And stop worrying. 
The “Mystery i-Gun” is quite 
harmless. I experimented a week 
before going into production.” 

“A week?” I could scarcely be- 
lieve my ears. “What happens when 
some kid jams his gun against a 
light-pole or an automobile ... or 
the night lock on the First National 
Bank?” 

“Nothing. It punches no holes. A 
large metallic object simply dis- 
sipates the field. The largest object 
it will handle is about a half -inch 
steel screw — ” 

“Baxter, your brother’s accident 
is connected to that device — and 
you turn it loose as a novelty!” 
“Nonsense. It’s safe as a knot- 
hole. It simply makes things dis- 
appear. Little things, like tacks, ball 
bearing, old rusty nuts and bolts — ” 
“And dimes and mamma’s ear- 
rings and the front door key,” I 
snapped back. “Until you know 
how to bring those things back you 
had no right to market that rig.” 
He laid his small hands before 
him on the desk. “Lieutenant, I’m 

66 



sick of working for other people. 
This is my chance to get a bank- 
roll to back my own contracting 
firm. Yes, I financed Calvin’s re- 
search because he’s brilliant, and I 
knew he’d come up with something 
some day. Now he’s done it, and 
I’m merely protecting his interests 
and my investment in him. See 
here.” He shoved some documents 
at me. There was the patent ap- 
plication, a declaration of partner- 
ship for purposes of marketing the 
Mystery i-Gun, and the articles of 
incorporation of the Baxter Con- 
struction Company. 

“Okay,” I said. “So you’ve cut 
your brother in on all this. Who’s 
his beneficiary when he dies?” 
“Still looking for a motive for 
murder, aren’t you. Lieutenant?” 

I didn’t admit it to him, but he 
was right. Galvin’s “accident” 
seemed too convenient to the pur- 
poses of his practical little brother, 
Leo. What’s more, the lab and 
medical men on the force were just 
as mystified today as they were 
when we brought Calvin in with 
the needle-thin hole in his skull. 
Old Doc Thorsen had admitted to 
me that he could name no imple- 
ment — not even a surgical instru- 
ment — that could have inflicted 
such a narrow gauge hole. It had to 
be caused by a fragment, hut there 
was no fragment in the brain! 

“Leo,” I said, “I know you con- 
sider this case closed, but I want 
you to do me a favor. I want to go 
over youf brother’s lab once more.” 
“But you’ve — ” He stopped, 
shrugged and nodded his head. 
“Okay. I’m interested in finding 
out what hurt Cal, as much as you 

WINSTON MARKS 




are. I’ll tell you, Fm busy the rest 
of this week, but Fll meet you at 
the old house next Monday evening 
at eight. You see, I closed up the 
place and moved downtown.” 

I agreed, with the feeling that he 
was deliberately making me wait 
just to annoy me. Leo Baxter was 
an important man now, a man 
graciously willing to cooperate with 
the police — at his own convenience. 
I stood up. “Your brother has been 
calling your name. I suppose they 
told you that?” 

“They phoned. Doctor said it 
was just mutterings.” 

“You haven’t even been to see 
him?” 

“What’s the use? He wouldn’t 
recognize me.” 

Well, it wasn’t any of my busi- 
ness, really, but it’s funny how you 
get to hate a man for his attitude. 
I don’t know what I expected to 
find by going over that lab-work- 
shop again, but whatever it was, I 
hoped it would incriminate Leo. 
On the face of it he was guilty of 
nothing more than a premature 
marketing of a new device, but the 
way he was cashing in on Galvin’s 
genius certainly did the dying man 
no honor. 

Cash in was right! The toys sold 
like bubble-gum. The papers, radio, 
and TV picked up the sensational 
gimmick and gave it a billion bucks 
worth of free advertising. And the 
profitable part of it was that the 
i-Gun was so simple to mass-pro- 
duce that Leo’s fifteen contracting 
manufacturers were almost able to 
keep up with the astronomical de- 
mand. 

Before that week was up, the 
BLEEDBACK 



Wall Street Journal estimated there 
were already more i-Guns in the 
hands of the juvenile public than 
all the yo-yos ever produced. They 
retailed at eighty-five cents, made 
of plastic with a hole in the back 
where you could change the pen- 
light battery. They sold, all right. 
They sold in drugstores and toy 
stores and dime stores and depart- 
ment stores. Toddler’s, tykes and 
teen-agers went for them. And 
adults. Maybe 30 million of them 
were in the hands of the public 
before I saw Leo Baxter next. 

Which was almost two weeks in- 
stead of the one week he had prom- 
ised. 

I finally got an appointment. 
“Sorry,” he said. “Fve been tied 
up with government people all 
week. The A. E. G. tried to get 
me in trouble.” 

I said, “Skip it. You promised 
for tonight. Now let’s go.” 

“I can’t possibly make it to- 
night.” He pointed at his desk. It 
was littered with correspondence, 
orders and contracts. “Give me one 
more week. Lieutenant.” 

It was an order, not a request. 

There was nothing to do but 
wait the third week. It was not, 
however, uneventful. It was the 
week the accidents began to hap- 
pen. 

At 4: 14 of a Tuesday afternoon, 
a man was admitted to a local 
hospital with a perforated belly. 
Straight through, hide, guts and 
liver. A newsman got hold of it and 
wrote a scare story about an attack 
with a pellet gun that must shoot 
needles. 

Before the edition was sold out 

67 




the hospitals were loaded with 
emergency cases. People with holes 
in them. Tiny little holes, mostly, 
but holes that went right through 
them. Then dogs. Then automo- 
biles, trucks and busses. Holes in 
their radiators. Holes in windshields 
that always went straight back, 
through seats and sometimes pas- 
sengers — ^right out through the rear 
end. 



T he city panicked. Then the 
county, state and nation. In 
two days, yes, the whole nation! 

At first everyone thought we 
were being attacked by some secret 
weapon. By some miracle of states- 
manship, the President of the 
United States prevented a “massive 
retaliation” attack by the army up- 
on our most likely enemy — long 
enough for Intelligence to affirm 
that no enemy on Earth was that 
mad at us. 

Then all thoughts turned to ex- 
tra-terrestrial space. A bombard- 
ment from the sky? It was ridicu- 
lous to even consider, because none 
of the holes that appeared in peo- 
ple and things came from above. 
The holes were almost entirely in 
the horizontal plane. 

Strangely enough during those 
first two days, nobody thought of 
the Mystery i-Gun. No one but me. 

Leo Baxter had disappeared into 
thin air, as completely as if he’d 
turned to metal and crawled into 
the muzzle of one of his own 
“toys”. 

I had every known place he fre- 
quented staked out with a pair of 
plain-clothesmen, but it was the 

68 



morning of the second day of ac- 
cidents before I got a radio call 
from the squad car stationed near 
the old Baxter home. 

Leo had come home at last. He 
was a sad looking midget when I 
got there. Obviously no sleep, un- 
shaven, deep hollows under his 
eyes. 

“I figured you’d be waiting for 
me. Lieutenant, but you know 
what?” he demanded. “I don’t 
give a damn! I kept waiting for 
them to figure out the answer to 
these accidents and string me up. 
How come you didn’t tell any- 
body?” 

I said, “Shut up and let’s go in- 
side.” 

Sure, I figured the i-Gun was the 
cause, but the last thing I wanted 
was for Leo to get strung up before 
I laid my hands on that other de- 
vice — the one that wouldn’t work. I 
wanted that rig and all the plans 
and formulae, and Leo undoubted- 
ly had them hidden deeper than 
Fort Knox. 

He unlocked the door, and I told 
the others to wait outside. We went 
into the hall and closed the door 
behind us. “So your little toy was 
harmless?” I said, grabbing him by 
his wrinkled lapels. “So it just 
shoots stuff off into another dimen- 
sion?” 

He stared at me, his eyes half 
glazed. “I don’t — know. That’s 
what the notes said.” He sank into 
a chair. “I guess it doesn’t, though. 
It must ball up the metal object 
and shoot it out — ^infinite velocity 
— reduced in size — infinite mass- 
infinite inertia — keeps circling the 
globe like — like a satellite. Goes 

WINSTON MARKS 




right through anything it hits. Goes 
on and on. Forever. Little bullets. 
Right through steel. Right through 
flesh and bones — ” 

“Simmer down,” I said. “You’ve 
been reading the papers. I’ve been 
checking the facts.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“That you were right the first 
time. It does shoot metal objects 
into another dimension. But they 
don^t stay there. They ooze back. 
Slowly. Real slow, so the first edge 
or comer that sticks back into our 
dimension is only a few millionths 
of an inch thick. Then a few ten- 
thousandths, then a few thou- 
sandths — and that’s about the time 
they start making holes in people 
and objects that run into them.'^ 
“Run into them?” 

“Certainly. There are no holes 
in buildings or other stationary ob- 
jects. The holes are all horizontal. 
Now look, Baxter, our only chance 
is to work on that other device and 
your brother’s notes, and maybe 
we can develop an extractor of 
some kind.” 

“No. No, you don’t understand,” 
he said shaking his head like a 
sleep-walker. “It balls up the metal. 
Shoots it out. Infinite mass. Infinite 
veloc — ” 

“Knock off that nonsense, and 
tell me where those plans are.” 
“Trying to steal my brother’s 
other invention, are you? It’s not 
patented yet. You know that, don’t 
you? Couldn’t patent it because I 
can’t make it work yet. You’re 
smart, but you won’t get it from 
me — ” 

I had a fair hold on him, but 
the pure insanity that flared in his 

BLEEDBACK 



eyes shocked me for just the instant 
it took him to wrench out of my 
hands. He stumbled to the door of 
the study and burst through it 
heading for the window. I didn’t 
hurry after him too fast, because I 
knew the boys outside would take 
him. 

Leo Baxter was only three paces 
into the stale air of the unused 
library when he screamed, clasping 
his hands to his chest and dropped. 
A peculiar grating, plucking sound 
came faintly before he thudded to 
the carpet. 

I stopped hard in my tracks and 
wiped the sweat from my face 
while Leo Baxter twitched almost 
at my feet, his heart shredded and 
bubbling its last in his perforated 
chest. 

The paper clips. The ones 1 had 
propelled into nothingness weeks 
ago. 

Hat in hand I advanced slowly, 
waving it before me chest high. 
Then it caught suddenly, grated for 
a split second and passed on in its 
arc. Now there were several tiny 
holes in it. I backed away a foot 
and brought my hat down slowly 
on the same lethal spot of air. 
Chest-high it caught and hung sus- 
pended. 

Leaving it there as a marker I 
took off my suitcoat, held it before 
me and inched forward toward 
the desk. Something plucked at the 
dangling garment, and a chill froze 
my spine. Had I been walking 
forward normally, the tiny speck 
of metal that barely caught the 
glint of light from the window, 
would have pierced my skin at just 
about the site of my appendix. I 

69 




circled the spot continuing to feel 
forward with my coat. That was 
the paper clip Baxter had fired to 
demonstrate to me that first day. 

At the phone I called headquar- 
ters and told the chief what to do. 

“You’re so right,” he told me, 
his voice slurring strangely. “Only 
you’re a little late. The order went 
out to confiscate the i-Guns. They 
think the damned toys might have 
something to do with the accidents. 
And I bought one of the first ones 
for my little Jerry!” His voice 
sounded hollow. 

So they were figuring it out! 
The next question was, how to ex- 
tract the deadly particles from the 
other dimension, or how to keep 
them from bleeding back slowly 
into ours. 

I moved cautiously through the 
old house fanning every inch of air 
ahead of me with a phone book. 
When I got to Calvin Baxter’s 
workshop I was especially careful, 
but I needn’t have been. The only 
metal particles stuck into the thin 
air seemed to be over his work- 
bench where he had been experi- 
menting with his device. All but 
one. 

It was right where I expected to 
find it — better than six feet in the 
air, just fore-head high for a mam 
tall as Calvin Baxter. He had fired 
his proto-type of the i-Gun just 
once into the middle of the room. 

How long ago? Eight — ^ten weeks 
ago? 

It seemed impossible that all this 
horror had occurred in such a short 
time. 

But there it was, stuck in space, 
protruding about a hundredth of 

70 



an inch from nowhere into clear 
visibility. So little was showing that 
I couldn’t be sure, but it looked 
like the tip of an ordinary little 
nail or wo^-screw. 

This was my “murder-weapon”, 
the cause of Calvin Baxter’s acci- 
dent, He’d run into it, jerked his 
head back, and the speck had come 
out the same hole it went in. 

In twenty minutes by the clock I 
had the lab crew out from head- 
quarters, and had explained the 
whole business to them. First they 
measured the length of the pro- 
trusion, and my guess was about 
right. It measured .0095 inches on 
the micrometer caliper. 

If it were a screw an inch long, 
at that rate of “bleedback” it would 
take another 98 weeks to come the 
rest of the way out. Almost two 
years! 

Paul Riley, the lab chief, was 
sharp. He caught it about the same 
time I did and turned to look at 
me, “We’ve got to figure a way of 
getting those things out of the 
way.” 

I nodded. “But quick.” 

Collins, our print man, said, 
“Why not just shoot them back 
into wherever it is they go, with 
another i-Gun?” 

“And have them come bleeding 
back after a few weeks?” Paid 
frowned him silent. 

He picked up a hammer from 
the bench and tapped the tiny, 
glinting speck. The point flattened 
out a bit, but the thud of the ham- 
mer indicated how solidly it was 
stuck. Then he walked around be- 
hind the point and struck it a hard 
blow from the cross-section side. 



WINSTON MARKS 




The hammer shivered in his hand 
and he dropped it, rubbing his 
numbed fingers with his other hand. 

“Lieutenant,” he said slowly, “we 
are up against something.” 

We found we could file away the 
metal easily enough. Sure it filed 
away until the file cut into empty 
space. But cold comfort that was. 
In a few hours, we knew, molecule 
by molecule, the screw buried in 
the other dimension would come 
oozing back, a minute but lethal 
speck ready to ambush th^ first very 
tall man who walked toward it. 

Tall man! 

That’s why Leo Baxter and I 
had failed to find it in the first 
place. I had criss-crossed that room 
half a thousand times in my pre- 
vious examinations. If I had been 
taller, or the speck of metal lower — 

“We’ve got to bring Calvin Bax- 
ter back to consciousness some- 
how,” I said. “We’ve got to find 
out how that extractor of his 
works.” 

“Right!” Jerry said, dropping his 
hands in resignation. We’d run out 
of ideas at the same time, and the 
senior Baxter appeared to be our 
only hope. 



W E FANNED our way out of 
there, into the squad car, and 
proceeded at a gingerly five miles 
per hour back to headquarters. On 
my insistence, Calvin Baxter had 
been set up in a private room at the 
jail with Doc Thorsen in attend- 
ance. The city hospitals were so 
jammed with accident victims and 
frantic relatives that it was no place 
to work with a man who was our 



only salvation. 

When I explained everything to 
Dr. Thorsen and told him how im- 
portant it was that we bring Calvin 
back to consciousness he shook his 
head. “It might be done, but it 
would probably kill him — ” 

“But you said he’d never recover 
anyway,” I argued. 

Thorsen seemed to be consider- 
ing that. “Yes,” he said at last. 
“That’s more apparent now than 
ever. He’s beginning to suffer the 
usual complications of immobility. 
Probably won’t last more than a 
few weeks anyway. But can’t you 
get the dope you want from his 
brother?” he stalled while he 
weighed his ethics against the ne- 
cessity of the moment. 

“His brother,” I told him, “is 
dead. Paper clips. Right through 
the heart.” 

“I see. Well, we could operate, 
but as I said, Calvin wouldn’t sur- 
vive for long. Maybe only hours or 
minutes. And maybe not even long 
enough to regain consciousness after 
we remove the clot.” 

I said, “I’ve left a crew at the 
Baxter house to tear it apart, board 
by board, until we find this so- 
called extractor that Leo hid. But 
even after we find it, we need Cal- 
vin to tell us how to make it work. 
There must be a part missing.” 

We had wandered into Calvin’s 
room and were talking over his 
great, supine body, covered to the 
chin with a white sheet. The speck 
of scalp on his forehead had dried 
up and dropped off leaving only a 
faint white spot. 

As I mentioned the missing part, 
his lips began moving and a grunt 

71 



BLEEDBACK 




issued from his throat. “Listen,” I 
said. “He hears me! He’s trying to 
talk!” 

“No, Lieutenant.” Thorsen said, 
putting a hand to his eyes. “He’s 
been grunting like that for days. 
The only word that ever comes out 
is his brother’s name, Leo.” 

The name struck anger and 
frustration in me. “Leo,” I half- 
shouted. “That stinking little — 
never even visited his brother!” 
“Relax, Gene. That won’t do any 
good. The man’s dead,” he re- 
minded me. 

“Relax? When all over the coun- 
try people are tearing their bodies 
to pieces? Innocent people. Little 
kids—” 

“I know, I know. I just spent 
nine hours in the emergency ward. 
Peritonitis. Cardiac injury. Lungs. 
Tom eye-balls. And it’s probably 
just the beginning.” 

“Then what are you waiting 
for?” I demanded. “Our only 
chance is to bring Calvin Baxter to 
consciousness long enough to ex- 
plain how his extractor works.” 
Doc ran trembling hands through 
his fuzz of white hair. For the first 
time I noticed that the pupils of his 
eyes were moving back and forth 
in little quick, darting motions like 
a wild animal looking for escape. “I 
— don’t know. Gene. I suppose you 
are right. Only — ^we need permis- 
sion — ^we must — ^you see, he might 
die, and — ” 

I took a good look at him and 
suddenly realized that despite his 
calm voice, the old man was going 
to pieces. I grabbed him by the arm 
and hauled him out of there, across 
the hall to the chief’s office. Dur- 

72 



Stine had his head down on his 
arms, slouched over the desk fast 
asleep between two clanging tele- 
phones. 

“Wake up, chief!” I said, shak- 
ing him by the shoulder. “We have 
to get J^ter to City Hospital 
and — ” 

Durstine raised his head and 
stared at me. His usually sharp, 
gray eyes were dull, and his face 
looked dirty with a stubble of black 
whiskers. With a deliberate motion 
of both hands he knocked the re- 
ceivers off both phones and fell 
back in his swivel chair. “Now 
what?” he asked thickly. 

“You’re drunk!” I exclaimed. 
Durstine, who would fire a 20-year 
man without a qualm if he caught 
a single trace of beer on his breath 
on duty, 

“What else is new?” He could 
barely focus his eyes on me. 

I swallowed a couple of times 
and began explaining what must be 
done. Get the mayor and Civil 
Defense on the phone. Com- 
mandeer all radio stations to ex- 
plain the true nature of the metallic 
particles to the public. Tell them 
to stay put, and when they did 
move, to walk slowly, fanning the 
air ahead of them with something 
solid — an umbrella, a coat, news- 
paper, garbage can lid — anything 
to warn them of the tiny, sus- 
pended daggers. 

“Yeah. Great idea. Some people 
doing it already.” He said it with- 
out enthusiasm. “Only trouble is, 
the phones are swamped. Com- 
munications are breaking down al- 
ready, and when people learn about 
the fever, they will blow sky-high.” 

WINSTON MARKS 




“The fever?” 

“The fever.” He bobbed his head 
loosely. “My Jerry died of it this 
afternoon. Came down with it day 
before yesterday. By the time we 
got him to the hospital this morn- 
ing he was running a hundred and 
five. Docs were too busy with 
bleeders. Wouldn’t listen to me un- 
til it was too late. Jerry’s dead. My 
little Jerry.” His voice was flat, his 
eyes staring straight ahead. 

Jerry was his only son, and one 
of the first kids in town to own an 
i-Gun. Durstine had said he bought 
it for himself. The chief went on, 
“What’s more, the fever’s epidemic. 
Before we left the hospital they 
were dragging victims in by the 
hundreds. Not just kids, either. On 
top of this other thing, we got the 
worst epidemic in history. No one 
knows what it is.” 

I looked at Thorsen. “You said 
you’d been at the hospital. What is 
it?” 

“I — saw a few cases.” He said it 
almost under his breath. 

I grabbed him by his coat lapels. 
“Snap out of it. Doc. If you know 
what it is, for God’s sake tell us!” 

“They don’t know what it is,” 
he said looking down at the floor. 

“But you do. I can tell by your 
face ” 

“All right, maybe I do.” His 
face was drawn and defiant with 
an almost fanatical determination. 
“There aren’t enough sulphas and 
antibiotics in the world to control 
it. We can’t do anything about it, 
so why drive people crazy with 
fear?” 

Durstine was coming out of his 
fog. He opened the big bottom 

BLEEDBACK 



drawer of his desk and handed an 
open fifth of whiskey to Thorsen. 
He said, “Doc, you’re in no condi- 
tion to make a decision like that.” 

Thorsen tipped up the bottle and 
let several swallows pour down his 
leathery neck. The stuff brought 
tears to his eyes. He blinked them 
away and wiped his mouth with 
the back of his hand. “All right, 
public guardian, I’ll tell you. It’s 
pretty obvious, and other medical 
men will think of it pretty quick, 
I suppose — when they find out the 
cause of the punctures they are 
treating. This fever is just more of 
the same. Peritonitis. Only it’s 
caused by particles so small that 
you can’t even feel when they pene- 
trate the skin. They’re large enough 
to poke holes in your intestines, 
though. Large enough to make 
microscopic passages for bacteria. 
So, you see, for every bleeding pa- 
tient, there will be hundreds, thou- 
sands, coming down with perito- 
nitis — infection of the body cavity 
from within. Without drugs the in- 
flammation spreads in hours, and 
the temperature goes up and up. 
It’s fatal.” 

I could almost feel the pain in 
my belly and the fire in my veins 
as he spoke. Doc Thorsen took 
another drink and handed me the 
bottle. “You look a little pale. Gene. 
Have a jolt and see if your guts 
leak.” 

Durstine and I both had a drink, 
and the chief said, “I see what 
you meant. I wish you’d kept your 
mouth shut.” 

I said, “Dammit, we’ve got to do 
something.” 

“Like what?” Durstine asked bit- 

73 




terly. “Like quarantining the 
schools and the playgrounds?” 

Thorsen nodded grimly. “And 
the parks? And all back yards and 
front yards?” 

Durstine picked it up again. 
“And empty lots and all sidewalks 
and streets and public buildings 
and the whole damned outdoors 
plus the indoors?” 

The enormity of the problem be- 
gan to sink into my tired brain. In 
the space of weeks, more than 30 
million i-Guns were sold in the 
United States alone. Multiply that 
figure by the number of times each 
was fired. Ten? Fifty? A hundred 
times? Only God knew how many 
billion nails, tacks, screws and 
rivets were launched into limbo, 
and were now just beginning to 
return — ^invisible at first — to skewer 
the American people. 

Wherever kids had played — and 
that was virtually everywhere — 
death was hidden. And the semi- 
visible particles would keep emerg- 
ing for weeks, in the order that 
they were shot into the other di- 
mension. Worse yet, at the slow rate 
of emergence, it would be months 
or years before the metallic flotsam 
returned completely and dropped 
to earth! 

A man could protect himself only 
by remaining motionless. But so- 
ciety was geared to motion, fast, 
space-covering motion. The nation 
would starve to death, if everyone 
didn’t go insane first and tear them- 
selves to pieces running around. 

“We’ve got to get Ae secret of 
that extractor out of Calvin Bax- 
ter,” I said. “If we can discover 
the principle, we can build large 

74 



models, like a vacuum cleaner — 



G etting Baxter into City Hos- 
pital and finding a competent 
surgeon in good enough condition 
to perform the delicate operation, 
took almost twenty-four hours. The 
hospital resembled an abattoir, the 
corridor floors slick from the drip- 
pings of fresh blood, as people 
seeking help wandered frantically 
from floor to floor. 

Somehow we managed to im- 
press upon the staff the fact that 
Baxter had priority, and we were 
allowed on the operating floor, 
which was guarded at all entries. 

Sick with exhaustion, I waited 
with Durstine. Thorsen was im- 
pressed into duty immediately, and 
that was the last we saw of him. It 
was a good many hours before they 
called us into the operating room. I 
won’t try to describe the sight in 
detail. Surgeons and nurses hovered 
over tables, weaving like drunken 
butchers in blood-soaked aprons. 
In one corner, on a cot, Baxter lay 
with his head and shoulders 
propped up high. His feet hung 
over the end at least fourteen 
inches. A single sheet covered 
him. 

The top of his skull was band- 
aged, and he looked even paler 
than before. A doctor and one 
nurse stood on either side of him. 
As we came in the doctor said, 
“I’ve been told of the problem. 
We’ve done all we can, but this 
man is dying. I think we can bring 
him to consciousness for a few 
minutes. It’s a terribly cruel thing 
to do, and I’m not sure he will be 

WINSTON AAARKS 




coherent. Are you sure you want 
me to try?” 

“It’s his invention that brought 
on all of this,” I said. “If there’s 
any solution to it, he has it in his 
head.” 

“Very well.” 

He did things with a hypodermic 
needle while the nurse rigged an 
oxygen tent. I’he smell of ether 
and blood made me sicker. My 
throat was dry, and I remember 
wishing I hadn’t drunk Durstine’s 
whiskey. As we stood waiting the 
humid air felt almost unbearably 
hot, and I had difficulty focussing 
my eyes. 

Durstine looked terrible, hollow- 
eyed, unshaven, but he seemed in 
better shape than I. It was he who 
caught the first flicker of Baxter’s 
eyes and dropped to his knees. The 
color came back to the scientist’s 
face in a rush of pink, and his chest 
heaved with deep breathing. 

“Can you hear me?” Durstine 
began. 

An hour later Baxter was dead 
as predicted. And so was all hope 
of removing the lethal debris with 
his other invention. The “extractor” 
didn’t work, he had told us. Yes, 
he’d been trying to reverse the field 
to retrieve the metallic objects 
from the other dimension, hut the 
experiment was a failure! 

Durstine took my arm. “Gome 
on. Gene. We’ve done all we can. 
I know one safe place — a place 
where no kids ever played.” 

“Yeah, I know,” I said with a 
tongue two sizes too big. “The near- 
est bar. The damned kids! They’ve 
murdered us! Led Baxter and the 



damned kids!” 

Things were turning gray, but I 
remember the chief catching me 
by the shoulder and jerking; me 
around. Too late 1 rememJbered 
about his little Jerry and the agony 
my words must have carvedl in his 
heart. I wished he’d slug me, but 
he didn’t. He looked at me for a 
long minute and said something I 
don’t remember, because the fog 
closed in — a hot, dry fog that swept 
into my brain and blacked out the 
h'ght. I don’t even remember fall- 
ing. 

The last thought I had was, the 
fever! Fve got it. And Thorsen said 
there were no more antibiotics or 
drugs left in the city. 



S OME WEEKS later it was a 
surprise but no pleasure, to dis- 
cover I was still alive. Through the 
smoke of my unfocussed eyes I 
could tell that my “private” room 
was occupied by at least a dozen 
other patients. Some were on cots 
and some, like me, simply lay on 
the floor v/ith a blanket over them. 

I had one 30-second visit from 
the doctor before Durstine came to 
take me away. The doc said simply, 
“You’re a lucky man, Lieutenant. 
We didn’t save many ‘fever’ pa- 
tients after the drugs ran out.” 
The chief brought a couple of 
boys in blue with a stretcher to 
haul me out, I w^as amazed to dis- 
cover that automobiles were still 
moving about the streets — not 
many, but a few. I was too sick and 
exhausted to talk during the ride. 

Durstine rode in back with me, a 
hand on my shoulder. “Don’t wor- 



BLEEDBACK 



75 




ry; Gfene,” he said. “You’re going 
to be all right. And we’ve got this 
thing pretty well licked.” 

He looked into my eyes and read 
the question I was too weak to 
speak aloud. 

“No/’ he said, “we didn’t figure 
out Baxter’s extractor. But we do 
have a successful detector, and all 
we have to do now is use it — 
then hang a tin can or an old ketch- 
up bottle on each speck of metal 
for a marker. Yeah, the coimtry’s 
going to be cluttered up like a 
hanging garbage dump for a long 
time, but if you can see ’em you 
can dodge ’em.” 

A detector? Why, they’d have to 
equip every person in the country 
with one! And surely nothing less 
than an electronic, radar-type 
gadget could detect the microscopic 
particles as they first began 
to emerge — the kind that had 
riddled my intestines and given 
me the fever without even leaving 
a mark on my skin. 

“I know what you are thinking,” 
Durstine said. His face was gray 
and drawn, but he wore a faint 
smile. “It was simple when some- 
body thought of it. What would be 
cheap enough to distribute univer- 
sally, yet effective enough to give 
you positive warning? You see, 
these tiny particles are so fine at 
first that you can fan the air with 
a plank and never know when one 
passes through.” 

He raised me up from the 
stretcher and let me look out the 
window of the police ambulance. 



Through squinted eyes I made out 
a strange sight. A thin scattering of 
pedestrians was moving slowly on 
the sidewalks, winding their ways 
among a random collection of 
floating tin cans and inverted 
bottles. 

When we stopped for a red light 
I watched a young woman in a 
business suit step between a whiskey 
bottle head-high, and a bean can 
about knee-high, and then proceed 
gingerly waving a colored sphere 
ahead of her. This sphere, about 
eighteen inches in diameter, sud- 
denly disappeared. She stopped 
abruptly and began shouting. Be- 
fore the traffic light turned green, 
a man came up with an empty 
motor oil can and placed it on the 
sidewalk, under the point she in- 
dicated in the air before her. 

Durstine explained, “When that 
speck gets large enough to support 
it, that can will be hung on it. 
Meanwhile, other people are fore- 
warned that the air over the can is 
out-of-bounds, so they won’t waste 
detectors on it.” 

As he spoke, the young woman 
was fishing another “detector” from 
her purse. It was a limp bit of some- 
thing which she placed to her lips 
and inflated until it was a foot-and- 
a-half in diameter, then she tied 
off the neck and proceeded down 
the walk waving it before her in 
great vertical sweeps. 

It was as simple as that. 

Our undoing had been a 85- 
cent kid’s toy. And our salvation 
was a penny-balloon! • • •

The obvious signs were missing, yet Callisto was 



moving steadily toward a state of totalitarianism. 



All the people were beginning to be exactly alike! 



L eon SIPLING groaned and 
pushed away his work papers. 
In an organization of thousands 
he was the only employee not put-

reach up and wave on the audio

“Say,” Sipling said hoarsely, “I 
think Pm stuck, Bab. How about 
running the gestalt through, up to

“The hum of other creative minds.” 
After a speculative moment, Bab-

OF YANCY 



PHILIP K. DICK 



“You holding up progress. Sip? 
This has to be integrated with the 
daily by six tonight. The schedule 
calls for the works to be on the 
vidlines during the dinner-hour 
stretch.” 

1 he visual side of the gestalt had 
already begun to form on the wall 
screen; Sipling turned his attention 
to it, grateful of a chance to escape 
Babson’ s cold glare. 

The screen showed a 3-D of 
Yancy, the usual three-quarter 
view, from the waist up. John Ed- 
ward Yancy in his faded work- 
shirt, sleeves rolled up, arms brown 
and furry. A middle-aged man in 
his late fifties, his face sunburned, 
neck slightly red, a good-natured 
smile on his face, squinting because 
he was looking into the sun. Behind 
Yancy was a still of his yard, his 
garage, his flower garden, lawn, the 
back of his neat little white plastic 
house. Yancy ^nned at Sipling: 
a neighbor pausing in the middle of 
a summer day, perspiring from the 
heat and the exertion of mowing 
his lawn, about to launch into a 
few harmless remarks about the 
weather, the state of the planet, 
the condition of die neighborhood.

“Say,” Yancy said, in the audio 
phones propped up on Sipling’s 
desk. His voice was low, personal. 
“The darndest thing happened to 
my grandson Ralf, the oAer morn- 
ing. You know how Ralf is; he’s al- 
ways getting to school half an hour 
early . says he likes to be in 
his seat before anybody else.” 

“That eager-beaver,” Joe Pines, 
at the next desk, cat-called. 

From the screen, Yancy’s voice 
rolled on, confident, amiable, un- 
disturbed. “Well, Ralf saw this 
squirrel; it was just sitting there 
on the sidewalk. He stopped for a 
minute and watched.” The look 
on Yancy’s face was so real that 
Sipling almost believed him. He 
could, almost, see the squirrel and 
the tow-headed youngest grandson 
of the Yancy family, the familiar 
child of the familiar son of the 
planet’s most familiar — and beloved 
— person. 

“This squirrel,” Yancy ex- 
plained, in his homey way, “was 
collecting nuts. And by golly, this 
was just the other day, only the 
middle of June. And here was this 
little squirrel — ” with his hands he 
indicated the size, “collecting these 
nuts and carrying them ofT for win- 
ter.” 

And then, the amused, anecdote- 
look on Yancy’s face faded. A 
serious, thoughtful look replaced it : 
the meaningful-look. His blue eyes 
darkened (good color work). His 
jaw became more square, more im- 
posing (good dummy-switch by the 
android crew). Yancy seemed old- 
er, more solemn and mature, more 
impressive. Behind him, the garden- 
scene had been jerked and a slight- 



ly different backdrop filtered in; 
Yancy now stood firmly planted in 
a cosmic landscape, among moun- 
tains and winds and huge old 
forests. 

“I got to thinking,” Yancy said, 
and his voice was deeper, slower. 
“There was that little squirrel. How 
did he know winter was coming? 
There he was, working away, get- 
ting prepared for it.” Yancy’s voice 
rose. “Preparing for a winter he’d 
never seen.” 

Sipling stiffened and prepared 
himself; it was coming. At his desk, 
Joe Pines grinned and yelled: “Get 
set!” 

“That squirrel,” Yancy said 
solemnly, “had faith. No, he never 
saw any sign of winter. But he knew 
winter was coming.” The firm jaw 
moved; one hand came slowly 
up . 

And then the image stopped. It 
froze, immobile, silent. No words 
came from it; abruptly the sermon 
ended, in the middle of a para- 
graph. 

“That’s it,” Babson said briskly, 
filtering the Yancy out. “Help you 
any?” 

Sipling pawed jerkily at his work 
papers. “No,” he admitted, “actual- 
ly it doesn’t. But — I’ll get it worked 
out.” 

“I hope so.” Babson’s face dark- 
ened ominously and his small mean 
eyes seemed to grow smaJler. 
“What’s the matter with you? 
Home problems?” 

“I’ll be okay,” Sipling muttered, 
sweating. “Thanks.” 

On the screen a faint impression 
of Yancy remained, still poised 
at the word coming. The rest of 

PHILIP K. DICK

the gestalt was in Sipling^s head: 
the continuing slice of words and 
gestures hadn’t been worked out 
and fed to the composite. Sipling’s 
contribution was missing, so the 
entire gestalt was stopped cold in 
its tracks. 

“Say,” Joe Pines said uneasily, 
“I’ll be glad to take over, today. 
Cut your desk out of the circuit 
and I’ll cut myself in.” 

“Thanks,” Sipling muttered, 
“but I’m the only one who can 
get this damn part. It’s the central 
gem.” 

“You ought to take a rest. You’ve 
been working too hard.” 

“Yes,” Sipling agreed, on the 
verge of hysteria. “I’m a Httle un- 
der the weather.” 

That was obvious: everybody in 
the office could see that. But only 
Sipling knew why. And he was 
fighting with all his strength to 
keep from screaming out the reason 
at the top of his limgs. 

Basic analysis of the political 
milieu at Callisto was laid out by 
Niplan computing apparatus at 
Washington, D.G.; but the final 
evaluations were done by human 
technicians. The Washin^on com- 
puters could ascertain that the Gal- 
listo political structure was moving 
toward a totalitarian make-up, but 
they couldn’t say what that in- 
dicated. Human beings were re- 
qmred to class the drift as malign. 

“It isn’t possible,” Taverner 
protested. “There’s constant in- 
dustrial traffic in and out of Cal- 
listo; except for the Ganymede syn- 
dicate they’ve got out-planet com- 
merce bottled up. We’d know as 

the mold of YANCY 



soon as anything phony got 
started.” 

“How would we know?” Police 
Director Kellman inquired. 

Taverner indicated the data- 
sheets, graphs and charts of figures 
and percentages that covered the 
walls of the Niplan Police offices. 
“It would show up in hundreds of 
ways. Terrorist raids, political pris- 
ons, extermination camps. We’d 
hear about political recanting, 
treason, disloyalty ... all the basic 
props of a dictatorship.” 

“Don’t confuse a totalitarian so- 
ciety with a dictatorship,” Kellman 
said drily. “A totalitarian state 
reaches into every sphere of its 
citizens’ lives, forms their opinions 
on every subject. The government 
can be a dictatorship, or a parlia- 
ment, or an elected president, or a 
council of priests. That doesn’t mat- 
ter.” 

“All right,” Taverner said, molli- 
fied. “I’ll go. I’ll take a team there 
and see what they’re doing.” 

“Gan you make yourselves look 
like Gallistotes?” 

“What are they like?” 

“I’m not sure,” Kellman ad- 
mitted thoughtfully, with a glance 
at the elaborate wall charts. “But 
whatever it is, they’re all beginning 
to turn out alike.” 

Among its passengers the inter- 
plan commercial liner that settled 
down at Gallisto carried Peter 
Taverner, his wife, and their two 
children. With a grimace of con- 
cern, Taverner made out the shapes 
of local officials waiting at the exit 
hatch. The passengers were going 
to be carefully screened; as the 



81 




ramp descended, the clot of officials 
moved forward. 

Taverner got to his feet and col- 
lected his family. “Ignore them/’ 
he told Ruth. “Our papers will get 
us by.” 

Expertly prepared documents 
identified him as a speculator in 
nonferric metals, ' looking for a 
wholesale outlet to handle his job- 
bing. Gallisto was a clearing-point 
for land and mineral operations; a 
constant flood of wealth-hungry en- 
trepreneurs streamed back and 
forth, carting raw materials from 
the underdeveloped moons, hauling 
mining equipment from the inner 
planets. 

Cautiously, Taverner arranged 
his topcoat over his arm. A heavy- 
set man, in his middle thirties, he 
could have passed for a successful 
business operator. His double- 
breasted business suit was expensive, 
but conservative. His big shoes 
were brightly shined. All things con- 
sidered, he’d probably get by. As 
he and his family moved toward 
the exit ramp, they presented a 
perfect and exact imitation of the 
out-planet business-class. 

“State your business,” a green- 
uniformed official demanded, pen- 
cil poised. I-d tabs were being 
checked, photographed, recorded. 
Brain pattern comparisons were be- 
ing made : the usual routine. 

“Nonferric enterprises,” Tavern- 
er began, but a second official cut 
him abruptly off> 

“You’re the third cop this morn- 
ing. What’s biting you people on 
Terra?” The official eyed Taverner 
intently. “We’re getting more cops 
than ministers.” 



Trying to maintain his poise, 
Taverner answered evenly: “I’m 
here to take a rest. Acute alcohol- 
ism — nothing official.” 

“That’s what your cohorts said,” 
The official grinned humorlessly. 
“Well, what’s one more Terran 
cop?” He slid the lock-bars aside 
and waved Taverner and his family 
through. “Welcome to Gallisto. 
Have fun — enjoy yourselves. Fast- 
est-growing moon in the system.” 
“Practically a planet,” Taverner 
commented ironically. 

“Any day, now.” The official ex- 
amined some reports. “According 
to our friends in your little organi- 
zation, you’ve been pasting up wall 
graphs and charts about us. Are we 
that important?” 

“Academic interest,” Taverner 
said ; if three spots had been made, 
then the whole team had been net- 
ted. The local authorities were ob- 
viously primed to detect infiltra- 
tion . the realization chilled him. 

But they were letting him 
through. Were they that confident? 

Things didn’t look good. Peer- 
ing around for a cab, he grimly pre- 
pared to undertake the business of 
integrating the scattered team 
members into a functioning whole. 



T hat evening, at the Stay- 

Lit bar on the main street of 
the commercial district of town, 
Taverner met with his two team 
members. Hunched over their 
whiskey sours, they compared notes. 

“I’ve been here almost twelve 
hours,” Eckmund stated, gazing im- 
passively at the rows of bottles in 
the gloomy depths of the bar. Gigar 



82 



PHILIP K. DICK 




smoke hovered in the air ; the auto- 
matic music box in the corner 
banged away metallically. “I’ve 
been walking around town, looking 
at things, making observations.” 

“Me,” Dorser said, “I’ve been at 
the tape-library. Getting official 
myth, comparing it to Callistote 
reality. And talking to the scholars 
— educated people hanging around 
the scanning rooms.” 

Taverner sipped his drink. “Any- 
thing of interest?” 

“You know the primitive rule- 
of-thumb test,” Eckmimd said wry- 
ly. “I loafed around on a slum 
street corner until I got in a con- 
versation with some people wait- 
ing for a bus. I started knocking 
the authorities: complaining about 
the bus service, the sewage disposal, 
taxes, everything. They chimed 
right in. Heartily. No hesitation. 
And no fear.” 

“The legal government,” Dorser 
commented, “is set up in the usual 
archaic fashion. Two-party system, 
one a little more conservative than 
the other — ^no fundamental dif- 
ference of course. But both elect 
candidates at open primaries, bal- 
lots circulated to all registered vo- 
ters.” A spasm of amusement 
touched him. “This is a model de- 
mocracy. I read the text books. 
Nothing but idealistic slogans : free- 
dom of speech, assembly, religion 
— the works. Same old grammar 
school stuff.” 

The three of them were tem- 
porarily silent. 

“There are jails,” Taverner said 
slowly. “Every society has law viola- 
tions.” 

“I visited one,” Eckmund said, 
THE MOLD OF YANCY 



belching. “Petty thieves, murderers, 
claim-jumpers, strong-arm hoods 
— the usual.” 

“No political prisoners?” 

“No.” Eckmund raised his voice. 
“We might as well discuss this at 
the top of our lungs. Nobody cares 
— the authorities don’t care.” 
“Probably after we’re gone they’ll 
clap a few thousand people into 
prison,” Dorser murmured thought- 
fully. 

“My God,” Eckmund retorted, 
“people can leave Gallisto any time 
they want. If you’re operating a 
police state you have to keep your 
borders shut. And these borders are 
wide open. People pour in and out.” 
“Maybe it’s a chemical in the 
drinking water,” Dorser suggested. 

“How the hell can they have a 
totalitarian society without terror- 
ism?” Eckmund demanded rhetori- 
cally. “I’ll swear to it — there are 
no thought-control cops here. 
There is absolutely no fear.” 

“Somehow, pressure is being ex- 
erted,” Taverner persisted. 

“Not by cops,” Dorser said em- 
phatically. “Not by force and bru- 
tality. Not by illegal arrest and im- 
prisonment and forced labor.” 

“If this were a police state,” Eck- 
mund said thoughtfully, “there’d 
be some kind of resistance move- 
ment. Some sort of ‘subversive’ 
group trying to overthrow the au- 
thorities. But in this society you’re 
free to complain; you can buy 
time on the t-v and radio stations, 
you can buy space in the news- 
papers — anything you want.” He 
shrugged. “So how can there be a 
clandestine resistance movement? 
It’s silly.” 



83 . 




“Nevertheless,” Taverner said, 
“these people are living in a one- 
party society, with a party line, with 
an official ideology. They show the 
effects of a carefully controlled to- 
talitarian state. They’re guinea pigs 
— whether they realize it or not.” 

“Wouldn’t they realize it?” 

Baffled, Taverner shook his head. 
“I would have thought so. There 
must be some mechanism we don’t 
understand.” 

“It’s all open. We can look every- 
thing over.” 

“We must be looking for the 
wrong thing.” Idly, Taverner gazed 
at the television screen above the 
bar. The nude girlie song-and- 
dance routine had ended; now the 
features of a man faded into view. 
A genial, round-faced man in his 
fifties, with guileless blue eyes, an 
almost childish twitch to his lips, 
a fringe of brown hair playing 
around his slightly prominent ears. 

“Friends,” the t-v image rum- 
bled, “it’s good to be with you 
again, tonight. I thought I might 
have a little chat with you.” 

“A commercial,” Dorser said, 
signalling the bartending machine 
for another drink. 

“Who is that?” Taverner asked 
curiously. 

“That kindly-looking geezer?” 
Eckmund examined his notes. “A 
sort of popular commentator. Name 
of Yancy.” 

“Is he part of the government?” 

“Not that I know of. A kind of 
home-spun philosopher. I picked 
up a biography of him on a maga- 
zine stand.” Eckmund passed the 
gaily-colored pamphlet to his boss. 
“Totally ordinary man, as far as 



I can see. Used to be a soldier; 
in the Mars- Jupiter War he 
distin^ished himself — battlefield 

commission. Rose to the rank of 
major.” He shrugged indifferently. 
“A sort of talking almanac. Pithy 
sayings on every topic. Wise old 
saws: how to cure a chest cold. 
What the trouble is back on Terra.” 
Taverner examined the booklet. 
“Yes, I saw his picture around.” 
“Very popular figure. Loved by 
the masses. Man of the people — 
speaks for them. When I was buy- 
ing cigarettes I noticed he endorses 
one particular brand. Very popular 
brand, now; just about driven the 
others off the market. Same with 
beer. The Scotch in this glass is 
probably the brand Yancy endorses. 
The same with tennis balls. Only 
he doesn’t play tennis — he plays 
croquet. All the time, every week- 
end.” Accepting his fresh drink 
Eckmund finished, “So now every- 
body plays croquet.” 

“How can croquet be a planet- 
wide sport?” Taverner demanded. 

“This isn’t a planet,” Dorser put 
in. “It’s a pipsqueak moon.” 

“Not according to Yancy,” Eck- 
mund said. “We’re supposed to 
think of Gallisto as a planet.” 
“How?” Taverner asked. 
“Spiritually, it’s a planet. Yancy 
likes people to take a spiritual view 
of matters. He’s strong on God and 
honesty in government and being 
hard-working and clean-cut. 
Warmed-over truisms.” 

The expression on Taverner’s 
face hardened. “Interesting,” he 
murmured. “I’ll have to drop by 
and meet him.” 

“Why? He’s the dullest, most 
PHILIP K. DICK 



84 




mediocre man you could dream 
up.” 

“Maybe/’ Taverner answered, 
“that’s why I’m interested.” 

Babson, huge and menacing, met 
Taverner at the entrance of the 
Yancy Building. “Of course you 
can meet Mr. Yancy. But he’s a 
busy man — it’ll take awhile to 
squeeze in an appointment. Every- 
body wants to meet Mr. Yancy.” 
Taverner was unimpressed. 
“How long do I have to wait?” 

As they crossed the main lobby 
to the elevators, Babson made a 
computation. “Oh, say four 
months.” 

“Four months 

“John Yancy is just about the 
most popular man alive.” 

“Around here, maybe,” Taverner 
commented angrily, as they en- 
tered the packed elevator. “I never 
heard of him before. If he’s got so 
much on the ball, why isn’t he 
piped all around Niplan?” 

“Actually,” Babson admitted, in 
a hoarse, confidential whisper, “I 
can’t imagine what people see in 
Yancy. As far as I’m concerned 
he’s just a big bag of wind. But 
people around here enjoy him. 
After all, Callisto is — provincial. 
Yancy appeals to a certain type of 
rural mind — to people who like 
their world simple. I’m afraid Ter- 
ra would be too sophisticated for 
Yancy.” 

“Have you tried?” 

“Not yet,” Babson said. Reflec- 
tively, he added: “Maybe later.” 
While Taverner was pondering 
the meaning of the big man’s words, 
the elevator ceased climbing. The 

THE MOLD OF YANCY 



two of them stepped off into a luxu- 
rious, carpeted hall, illuminated by 
recessed lights. Babson pushed open 
a door, and they entered a large, 
active office. 

Inside, a screening of a recent 
Yancy gestalt was in progress. A 
group of yance-men watched it 
silently, faces alert and critical. The 
gestalt showed Yancy sitting at his 
old-fashioned oak desk, in his study. 
It was obvious that he had been 
working on some philosophical 
thoughts: spread out over the desk 
were books and papers. On Yancy’s 
face was a thoughtful expression; 
he sat with his hand against his 
forehead, features screwed up into 
a solemn study of concentration. 

“This is for next Sunday morn- 
ing,” Babson explained. 

Yancy’s lips moved, and he spoke. 
“Friends,” he began, in his deep, 
personal, friendly, man-to-man 
voice, “I’ve been sitting here at my 
desk — well, about the way you’re 
sitting around your living rooms.” 
A switch in camera work occurred; 
it showed the open door of Yancy’s 
study. In the living room was the 
familiar figure of Yancy’s sweet- 
faced middle-aged homey wife ; she 
was sitting on the comfortable sofa 
primly sewing. On the floor their 
grandson Ralf played the familiar 
game of jacks. The family dog 
snoozed in the corner. 

One of the watching yance-men 
made a note on his pad. Taverner 
glanced at him curiously, baffled. 

“Of course, I was in there with 
them,” Yancy continued, smiling 
briefly. “I was reading the funnies 
to Ralf. He was sitting on my 
knee.” The background faded, and 

85 




a momentary phantom scene of 
Yancy sitting with his grandson on 
his knee floated into being. Then 
the desk and the book-lined study 
returned. “Fm mighty grateful for 
my family,” Yancy revealed. “In 
these times of stress, it’s my family 
that I turn to, as my pillar of 
strength.” 

Another notation was made by a 
watching yance-man. 

“Sitting here in my study, this 
wonderful Sunday morning,” Yan- 
cy rumbled on, “I realize how lucky 
we are to be alive, and to have this 
lovely planet, and the fine cities 
and houses, all the things God has 
given us to enjoy. But we’ve got to 
be careful. We’ve got to make sure 
we don’t lose these things.” 

A change had come over Yancy. 
It seemed to Taverner that the 
image was subtly altering. It wasn’t 
the same man ; the good humor was 
gone. This was an older man, and 
larger. A firm-eyed father, speak- 
ing to his children. 

“My friends,” Yancy intoned, 
“there are forces that could weaken 
this planet. Everything we’ve built 
up for our loved ones, for our chil- 
dren, could he taken away from us 
overnight. We must learn to be vig- 
ilant. We must protect our liberties, 
our possessions, our way of life. If 
we become divided, and fall to 
bickering among each other, we 
will be easy prey for our enemies. 
We must work together, my friends. 

“That’s what I’ve been thinking 
about this Sunday morning. Co- 
operation. T eamwork. We’ve got to 
be secure, and to be secure, we must 
be one united people. That’s the 
key, my friends, the key to a more 



abundant life.” Pointing out the 
window at the lawn and garden, 
Yancy said: “You know, I was . 

The voice trailed off. The image 
froze. Full room lights came on, 
and the watching yance-men 
moved into muttering activity. 

“Fine,” one of them said. “So far, 
at least. But where’s the rest?” 
“Sipling, again,” another an- 
swered. “His slice still hasn’t come 
through. What’s wrong with that 
guy?” 

Scowling, Babson detached him- 
self. “Pardon me,” he said to Tav- 
erner. “I’ll have to excuse myself 
— technical matters. You’re free to 
look around, if you care to. Help 
yourself to any of the literature — 
anything you want.” 

“Thanks,” Taverner said uncer- 
tainly. He was confused ; everything 
seemed harmless, even trivial. But 
something basic was wrong. 
Suspiciously, he began to prowl. 



I T WAS obvious that John Yancy 
had pontificated on every known 
subject. A Yancy opinion on every 
conceivable topic was available . 
modern art, or garlic in cooking, 
or the use of intoxicating beverages, 
or eating meat, or socialism, or war, 
or education, or open-front dresses 
on women, or high taxes, or athe- 
ism, or divorce, or patriotism — 
every shade and nuance of opinion 
possible. 

Was there any subject that 
Yancy hadn^t expressed himself on? 

Taverner examined the volum- 
inous tapes that lined the walls of 
the offices. Yancy’s utterances had 
run into billions of tape feet . 

PHILIP K. DICK 



86 




could one man have an opinion on 
everything in the universe? 

Choosing a tape at random, he 
found himself being addressed on 
the topic of table manners. 

“You know,” the miniature Yan- 
cy began, his voice tinny in Taver- 
ner’s ears, “at dinner the other 
night I happened to notice how my 
grandson Ralf was cutting his 
steak.” Yancy grinned at the viewer, 
as an image of the six-year-old boy 
sawing grimly away floated briefly 
into sight. “Well, I got to think- 
ing, there was Ralf working away 
at that steak, not having any luck 
with it. And it seemed to me — ” 

Taverner snapped the tape off 
and returned it to the slot. Yancy 
had definite opinions on everything 
... or were they so definite? 

A strange suspicion was growing 
in him. On some topics, yes. On 
minor issues, Yancy had exact rules, 
specific maxims drawn from 
mankind’s rich storehouse of folk- 
lore. But major philosophical and 
political issues were something else 
again. 

Getting out one of the many 
tapes listed under War, Taverner 
ran it through at random. 

“. I’m against war,” Yancy 
pronounced angrily. “And I ought 
to know; I’ve done my share of 
fighting.” 

There followed a montage of 
battle scenes: the Jupiter-Mars 

War in which Yancy had distin- 
guished himself by his bravery, his 
concern for his comrades, his ha- 
tred of the enemy, his variety of 
proper emotions. 

“But,” Yancy continued staunch- 
ly, “I feel a planet must be strong. 

THE MOLD OF YANCY 



We must not surrender ourselves 
meekly . weakness invites attack 
and fosters aggression. By being 
weak we promote war. We must 
gird ourselves and protect those we 
love. With all my heart and soul 
I’m against useless wars; but I say 
again, as I’ve said many times be- 
fore, a man must come forward 
and fight a just war. He must not 
shrink from his responsibility. War 
is a terrible thing. But sometimes 
we must ...” 

As he restored the tape, Taverner 
wondered just what the hell Yancy 
had said. What were his views on 
war? They took up a hundred 
separate reels of tape; Yancy was 
always ready to hold forth on such 
vital and grandiose subjects as War, 
the Planet, God, Taxation. But did 
he say anything? 

A cold chill crawled up Taver- 
ner’s spine. On specific — and trivial 
— items there were absolute opin- 
ions: dogs are better than cats, 
grapefruit is too sour without a 
dash of sugar, it’s good to get up 
early in the morning, too much 
drinking is bad. But on big topics 
... an empty vacuum, filled with 
the vacant roll of high-sounding 
phrases. A public that agreed with 
Yancy on war and taxes and God 
and planet agreed with absolutely 
nothing. And with everything. 

On topics of importance, they 
had no opinion at all. They only 
thought they had an opinion. 

Rapidly, Taverner scanned tapes 
on various major subjects. It was 
the same all down the line. With 
one sentence Yancy gave; with the 
next he took away. The total effect 
was a neat cancellation, a skillful 



87 




negation. But the viewer was left 
with the illusion of having con- 
sumed a rich and varied intellectual 
feast. It was amazing. And it was 
professional: the ends were tied up 
too slickly to be mere accident. 

Nobody was as harmless and va- 
pid as John Edward Yancy. He 
was just too damn good to be true. 

Sweating, Taverner left the main 
reference room and poked his way 
toward the rear offices, where busy 
yance-men worked away at their 
desks and assembly tables. Activity 
whirred on all sides. The expression 
on the faces around him was be- 
nign, harmless, almost bored. The 
same friendly, trivial expression 
that Yancy himself displayed. 

Harmless — and in its harmless- 
ness, diabolical. And there wasn’t 
a damn thing he could do. If people 
liked to listen to John Edward 
Yancy, if they wanted to model 
themselves after him — what could 
the Niplan police do about it? 

What crime was being com- 
mitted? 

No wonder Babson didn’t care if 
the police prowled around. No won- 
der the authorities had freely ad- 
mitted them. There weren’t any 
political jails or labor gangs or con- 
centratioh camps . there didn’t 
have to be. 

Torture chambers and extermin- 
ation camps were needed only when 
persuasion failed. And persuasion 
was working perfectly. A police 
state, rule by terror, came about 
when the totalitarian apparatus be- 
gan to break down. The earlier to- 
talitarian societies had been incom- 
plete; the authorities hadn’t really 
gotten into every sphere of life. But 

88 



techniques of conununication had 
improved. 

The first really successful totali- 
tarian state was being realized be- 
fore his eyes: harmless and trivial, 
it emerged. And the last stage — 
nightmarish, but perfectly logical — 
was when all the newborn boys 
were happily and voluntarily named 
John Edward. 

Why not? They already lived, 
acted, and thought like John Ed- 
ward. And there was Mrs. Mar- 
garet Ellen Yancy, for the women. 
She had her full range of opinions, 
too; she had her kitchen, her taste 
in clothes, her little recipes and 
advice, for all the women to imi- 
tate. 

There were even Yancy children 
for the youth of the planet to imi- 
tate. The authorities hadn’t over- 
looked anything. 

Babson strolled over, a genial ex- 
pression on his face. “How’s it 
going, officer?” he chuckled wetly, 
putting his hand on Taverner’s 
shoulder. 

“Fine,” Taverner managed to an- 
swer; he evaded the hand. 

“You like our little establish- 
ment?” There was genuine pride 
in Babson’s thick voice. “We do a 
good job. An artistic job — ^we have 
real standards of excellence.” 

Shaking with helpless anger, 
Taverner plunged out of the office 
and into the hall. The elevator took 
too long; furiously, he turned to^ 
ward the stairs. He had to get out 
of the Yancy Building; he had to 
get away. 

From the shadows of the hall a 
man appeared, face pale and taut. 
“Wait. Can — I talk to you?” 

PHILIP K. DICK 




Taverner pushed past him. 
“What do you want?” 

“You’re from the Terran Niplan 
Police? I — ” The man’s Adam’s 
apple bobbed. “I work here. My 
name’s Sipling, Leon Sipling. I 
have to do something — I can’t 
stand it any more.” 

“Nothing can be done,” Taver- 
ner told him. “If they want to be 
like Yancy — ” 

“But there isn’t any Yancy,” Sip- 
ling broke in, his thin face twitch- 
ing spasmodically. “We made him 
up ... we invented him.” 

Taverner halted. “You what?^^ 
“I’ve decided.” Voice quavering 
excitedly, Sipling rushed on: “I’m 
going to do something — and I know 
exactly what.” Catching hold of 
Taverner’s sleeve he grated : 
“You’ve got to help me. I can stop 
all this, but I can’t do it alone.” 



I N LEON Sipling’s attractive, 
well-furnished living room, the 
two of them sat drinking coffee 
and watching their children scram- 
ble around on the floor, playing 
games. Sipling’s wife and Ruth 
Taverner were in the kitchen, dry- 
ing the dishes. 

“Yancy is a synthesis,” Sipling 
explained. “A sort of composite 
person. No such individual actually 
exists. We drew on basic prototypes 
from sociological records; we based 
the gestalt on various typical per- 
sons. So it’s true to life. But we 
stripped off what we didn’t want 
and intensified what we did want.” 
Broodingly, he added : “There 

could be a Yancy. There are a lot 
of Yancy-like people. In fact, that’s 

THE MOLD OF YANCY 



the problem.” 

“You deliberately set out with 
the idea of remolding people along 
Yancy’s line?” Taverner inquired. 

“I can’t precisely say what the 
idea is, at top level. I was an ad 
writer for a mouth wash company. 
The Gallisto authorities hired me 
and outlined what they wanted me 
to do. I’ve had to guess as to the 
purpose of the project.” 

“By authorities, you mean the 
governing council?” 

Sipling laughed sharply. “I mean 
the trading syndicates that own this 
moon: lock, stock, and barrel. But 
we’re not supposed to call it a 
moon. It’s a planet.” His lips 
twitched bitterly. “Apparently, the 
authorities have a big program built 
up. It involves absorbing their trade 
rivals on Ganymede — when that’s 
done, they’ll have the out-planets 
sewed up tight.” 

“They can’t get at Ganymede 
without open war,” Taverner pro- 
tested. “The Medean companies 
have their own population behind 
them.” And then it dawned. “I 
see,” he said softly. “They’d actually 
start a war. It would be worth a 
war, to them.” 

“You’re damn right it would. 
And to start a war, they have to get 
the public lined up. Actually, the 
people here have nothing to gain. 
A war would wipe out all the small 
operators — it would concentrate 
power in fewer hands — and they’re 
few enough already. To get the 
eighty million people here behind 
the war, they need an indifferent, 
sheep-like public. And the'/re get- 
ting that. When this Yancy cam- 
paign is finished, the people here 

89 




on Gallisto will accept anything. 
Yancy does all their thinking for 
them. He tells them how to wear 
their hair. What games to play. He 
tells the jokes the men repeat in 
their back rooms. His wife whips 
up the meal they all have for din- 
ner. All over this little world — 
millions of duplicates of Yancy’s 
day. Whatever he does, whatever 
he believes. We’ve been condition- 
ing the public for eleven straight 
years. The important thing is the 
unvarying monotony of it. A whole 
generation is growing up looking to 
Yancy for an answer to every- 
thing.” 

“It’s a big business, then,” 
Taverner observed. “This project 
of creating and maintaining Yan- 
cy.” 

“Thousands of people are in- 
volved in just writing the material. 
You only saw the first stage — and 
it goes into every city. Tapes, films, 
books, magazines, posters, pam- 
phlets, dramatic visual and audio 
shows, plants in the newspapers, 
sound trucks, kids’ comic strips, 
word-of-mouth report, elaborate 
ads . the works. A steady stream 
of Yancy.” Picking up a magazine 
from the coffee table he indicated 
the lead article. “ ‘How is John 
Yancy’s Heart?’ Raises the question 
of what would we do without Yan- 
cy? Next week, an article on 
Yancy’s stomach.” Acidly, Sipling 
finished: “We know a million ap- 
proaches. We turn it out of every 
pore. We’re called yance-men; it’s 
a new art-form.” 

“How do you — the corps, feel 
about Yancy?” 

“He’s a big sack of hot air.” 



“None of you is convinced?” 

“Even Babson has to laugh. And 
Babson is at the top; after him 
come the boys who sign the checks. 
God, if we ever started believing 
in Yancy ... if we got started 
thinking that trash meant some- 
thing — ” An expression of acute 
agony settled over Sipling’s face. 
“That’s it. That’s why I can’t 
stand it.” 

“Why?” Taverner asked, deeply 
curious. His throat-mike was taking 
it all in, relaying it back to the 
home office at Washington. “I’m 
interested in finding out why you 
broke away.” 

Sipling bent down and called his 
son. “Mike, stop playing and come 
on over here.” To Taverner he ex- 
plained: “Mike’s nine years old. 
Yancy’s been around as long as he’s 
been alive.” 

Mike came dutifully over. “Yes, 
sir?” 

“What kind of marks do you get 
in school?” his father asked. 

The boy’s chest stuck out proud- 
ly; he was a clear-eyed little mini- 
ature of Leon Sipling. “All A’s and 
B’s.” 

“He’s a smart kid,” Sipling said 
to Taverner. “Good in arithmetic, 
geography, history, all that stuff.” 
Turning to the boy he said: “I’m 
going to ask you some questions; 
I want this gentleman to hear your 
answers. Okay?” 

“Yes, sir,” the boy said obedient- 

His thin face grim, Sipling said 
to his son: “I want to know what 
you think about war. You’ve been 
told about war in school ; you 
know about all the famous wars in 



90 



PHILIP K. DICK 




history. Right?” 

“Yes, sir. We learned about the 
American Revolution, and the 
First Global War, and then the 
Second Global War, and then the 
First Hydrogen War, and the War 
between the colonists on Mars and 
Jupiter.” 

“To the schools,” Sipling ex- 
plained tightly to Taverner, “we 
distribute Yancy material — educa- 
tional subsidies in packet form. 
Yancy takes children through his- 
tory, explains the meaning of it 
all. Yancy explains natural science. 
Yancy explains good posture and 
astronomy and every other thing 
in the universe. But I never thought 
my own son ...” His voice trailed 
off unhappily, then picked up life. 
“So you know all about war. Okay, 
what do you think of war?” 

Promptly, the boy answered : 
“War is bad. War is the most 
terrible thing there is. It almost 
destroyed mankind.” 

Eying his son intently, Sipling 
demanded: “Did anybody tell you 
to say that?” 

The boy faltered uncertainly. 
“No, sir.” 

“You really believe those 
things?” 

“Yes, sir. It’s true, isn’t it? Isn’t 
war bad?” 

Sipling nodded. “War is bad. 
But what about just wars?” 

Without hesitation the boy an- 
swered: “We have to fight just 
wars, of course.” 

“Why?” 

“Well, we have to protect our 
way of life.” 

“Why?” 

Again, there was no hesitation 
THE MOLD OF YANCY 



in the boy’s reedy answer. “We 
can’t let them walk over us, sir. 
That would encourage aggressive 
war. We can’t permit a world of 
brute power. We have to have a 
world of — ” He searched for the 
exact word. “A world of law/^ 

Wearily, half to himself, Sipling 
commented: “I wrote those mean- 
ingless, contradictory words myself, 
eight years ago.” Pulling himself 
together with a violent effort he 
asked: “So war is bad. But we 
have to fight just wars. Well, may- 
be this — planet, Callisto, will get 
into a war with . let’s pick Gany- 
mede, at random.” He was unable 
to keep the harsh irony from his 
voice. “Just at random. Now, we’re 
at war with Ganymede. Is it a just 
war? Or only a war?” 

This time, there was no answer. 
The boy’s smooth face was screwed 
up in a bewildered, struggling 
frown. 

“No answer?” Sipling inquired 
icily. 

“Why, uh,” the boy faltered. “I 
mean . .” He glanced up hope- 
fully. “When the time comes won’t 
somebody say?” 

“Sure,” Sipling choked. “Some- 
body will say. Maybe even Mr. 
Yancy.” 

Relief flooded the boy’s face. 
“Yes, sir. Mr. Yancy will say.” He 
retreated back toward the other 
children. “Can I go, now?” 

As the boy scampered back to 
his game, Sipling turned miserably 
to Taverner. “You know what 
game they’re playing? It’s called 
Hippo-Hoppo. Guess whose grand- 
son just loves it. Guess who in- 
vented the game.” 



91 




There was silence. 

“What do you suggest?” Taver- 
ner asked. “You said you thought 
something could be done.” 

A cold expression appeared on 
Sipling’s face, a flash of deeply-felt 
cunning. “I know the project . 
I know how it can be pried apart. 
But somebody has to stand with a 
gun at the head of the authorities. 
In nine years I’ve come to see the 
essential key to the Yancy char- 
acter . the key to the new type 
of person we’re growing, here. It’s 
simple. It’s the element that makes 
that person malleable enough to be 
led around.” 

“I’ll bite,” Taverner said patient- 
ly, hoping the line to Washington 
was good and clear. 

“All Yancy’s beliefs are insipid. 
The key is thinness. Every part of 
his ideology is diluted : nothing ex- 
cessive. We’ve come as close as 
possible to no beliefs . you’ve 
noticed that. Wherever possible 
we’ve cancelled attitudes out, left 
the person a-political. Without a 
viewpoint.” 

“Sure,” Taverner agreed. “But 
with the illusion of a viewpoint.” 
“All aspects of personality have 
to be controlled; we want the total 
person. So a specific attitude has to 
exist for each concrete question. In 
every respect, our rule is: Yancy 
believes the least troublesome pos- 
sibility. The most shallow. The 
simple, effortless view, the view 
that fails to go deep enough to stir 
any real thought.” 

Taverner got the drift. “Good 
solid lulling views.” Excitedly he 
hurried on, “But if an extreme, 
original view got in, one that took 

92 



real effort to work out, something 
that was hard to live . .” 

“Yancy plays croquet. So every- 
body fools around with a mallet.” 
Sipling’s eyes gleamed. “But sup- 
pose Yancy had a preference for — 
Kriegspiel.” 

“For what?'^ 

“Chess played on two boards. 
Each player has his own board, 
with a complete set of men. He 
never sees the other board. A 
moderator sees both; he tells each 
player when he’s taken a piece, or 
lost a piece, or moved into an oc- 
cupied square, or made an im- 
possible move, or checked, or is in 
check himself.” 

“I see,” Taverner said quickly. 
“Each player tries to infer his op- 
ponent’s location on the board. He 
plays blind. Lord, it would take 
every mental faculty possible.” 
“The Prussians taught their of- 
ficers military strategy that way. 
It’s more than a game: it’s a cos- 
mic wrestling match. What if 
Yancy sat down in the evening with 
his wife and grandson, and played 
a nice lively six-hour game of 
Kriegspiel? Suppose his favorite 
books — instead of being western 
gun-toting anachronisms — were 
Greek tragedy? Suppose his favor- 
ite piece of music was Bach’s Art 
of the Fugue, not My Old Ken- 
tucky Home?^^ 

“I’m beginning to get the pic- 
ture,” Taverner said, as calmly as 
possible. “I think we can help.” 



B ABSON squeaked once. “But 
this is — illegal!” 

“Absolutely,” Taverner acknowl- 
PHILIP K. DICK 




edged. “That’s why we’re here,” 
He waved the squad of Niplan 
secret-servicemen into the offices 
of the Yancy Building, ignoring the 
stunned workers sitting bolt-upright 
at their desks. Into his throat-mike 
he said, “How’s it coming with the 
big-shots?” 

“Medium,” Kellman’s faint voice 
came, strengthened by the relay 
system between Gallisto and Earth. 
“Some slipped out of bounds to 
their various holdings, of course. 
But the majority never thought 
we’d take action.” 

“You can’t!” Babson bleated, his 
great face hanging down in wattles 
of white dough. “What have we 
done? What law — ” 

“I think,” Taverner interrupted, 
“we can get you on purely com- 
mercial grounds alone. You’ve 
used the name Yancy to endorse 
various manufactured products. 
There’s no such person. That’s a 
violation of statutes governing 
ethical presentation of advertising.” 
Babson’s mouth closed with a 
snap, then slid feebly open. “No — 
such — ^person? But everybody 
knows John Yancy. Why, he’s — ” 
Stammering, gesturing, he finished, 
“He’s everywhere.” 

Suddenly a wretched little pistol 
appeared in his pulpy hand; he 
was waving it wildly as Dorser 
stepped up and quietly knocked it 
skidding across the floor. Babson 
collapsed into fumbling hysterics. 

Disgusted, Dorser clamped hand- 
grapples around him. “Act like a 
man,” he ordered. But there was no 
response; Babson was too far gone 
to hear him. 

Satisfied, Taverner plunged off, 
THE MOLD OF YANCY 



past the knot of stunned officials 
and workers, into the inner offices 
of the project. Nodding curtly, 
Taverner made his way up to the 
desk where Leon Sipling sat sur- 
rounded by his work. 

The first of the altered gestalts 
was already flickering through the 
scanner. Together, the two men 
stood watching it. 

“Well?” Taverner said, when it 
was done. “You’re the judge.” 

“I believe it’ll do,” Sipling an- 
swered nervously. “I hope we don’t 
stir up too much . it’s taken 
eleven years to build it up ; we 
want to tear it down by degrees.” 
“Once the first crack is made, it 
should start swaying.” Taverner 
moved toward the door. “Will you 
be all right on your own?”

Sipling glanced at Eckmund who 
lounged at the end of the office, 
eyes fixed on the uneasily working 
yance-men. “I suppose so. Where 
are you going?” 

“I want to watch this as it’s re- 
leased. I want to be around when 
the public gets its first look at it.” 
At the door, Taverner lingered. 
“It’s going to be a big job for you, 
putting out the gestalt on your 
own. You may not get much help, 
for awhile.” 

Sipling indicated his co-workers; 
they were already beginning to 
pick up their tempo where they 
had left off. “They’ll stay on the 
job,” he disagreed. “As long as they 
get full salaries.” 

Taverner walked thoughtfully 
across the hall to the elevator. A 
moment later he was on his way 
downstairs. 

At a nearby street comer, a 
group of people had collected 
around a public vid-screen. Antici- 
pating the late-afternoon t-v cast 
of John Edward Yancy, 

The gestalt began in the regular 
way. There was no doubt about 
it : when Sipling wanted to, he 
could put together a good slice. 
And in this case he had done 
practically the whole pie. 

In rolled-up shirt sleeves and 
dirt-stained trousers, Yancy 
crouched in his garden, a trowel 
in one hand, straw hat pulled down 
over his eyes, grinning into the 
warm glare of the sun. It was so 
real that Taverner could hardly be- 
lieve no such person existed. But 
he had watched Sipling’ s sub-crews 
laboriously and expertly construct- 
ing the thing from the ground up. 



“Afternoon,” Yancy rumbled 
genially. He wiped perspiration 
from his steaming, florid face and 
got stiffly to his feet. “Man,” he 
admitted, “it’s a hot day.” He in- 
dicated a flat of primroses. “I was 
setting them out. Quite a job.” 

So far so good. The crowd 
watched impassively, taking their 
ideological nourishment without 
particular resistance. All over the 
moon, in every house, schoolroom, 
office, on each street corner, the 
same gestalt was showing. And it 
would be shown again. 

“Yes,” Yancy repeated, “it’s real- 
ly hot. Too hot for those primroses 
— they like the shade.” A fast pan- 
up showed he had carefully planted 
his primroses in the shadows at 
the base of his garage. “On the 
other hand,” Yancy continued, in 
his smooth, good-natured, over-the- 
back-fence conversational voice, 
“my dahlias need lots of sun.” 

The camera leaped to show the 
dahlias blooming frantically in the 
blazing sunlight. 

Throwing himself down in a 
striped lawnchair, Yancy removed 
his straw hat and wiped his brow 
with a pocket handkerchief. “So,” 
he continued genially, “if anybody 
asked me which is better, shade or 
sun. I’d have to reply it depends 
on whether you’re a primrose or a 
dahlia.” He grinned his famous 
guileless boyish grin into the cam- 
eras. “I guess I must be a primrose 
— I’ve had all the sun I can stand 
for today.” 

The audience was taking it in 
without complaint. An inauspicious 
beginning, but it was going to have 
long-term consequences. And Yan- 



94 



PHILIP K. DICK 




cy was starting to develop them 
right now. 

His genial grin faded. That fa- 
miliar look, that awaited serious 
frown showing that deep thoughts 
were coming, faded into place. 
Yancy was going to hold forth: 
wisdom was on the way. But it was 
nothing ever uttered by him be- 
fore. 

“You know,” Yancy said slowly, 
seriously, “that makes a person do 
some thinking.” Automatically, he 
reached for his glass of gin and 
tonic — a glass which up until now 
would have contained beer. And 
the magazine beside it wasn’t Dog 
Stories Monthly; it was The Jour- 
nal of Psychological Review. The 
alteration of peripheral props 
would sink in subliminally ; right 
now, all conscious attention was 
riveted on Yancy’s words. 

“It occurs to me,” Yancy orated, 
as if the wisdom were fresh and 
brand-new, arriving just now, “that 
some people might maintain that, 
say, sunlight is good and shade is 
bad. But that’s downright silly. 
Sunlight is good for roses and 
dahlias, but it would darn well 
finish off my fuchsias.” 

The camera showed his ubiqui- 
tous prize fuchsias. 

“Maybe you know people like 
that. They just don’t understand 
that — ” And as was his custom, 
Yancy drew on folklore to make 
his point. “That one man’s meat,” 
he stated profoundly, “is another 
man’s poison. Like, for instance, 
for breakfast I like a couple of eggs 
done sunny-side up, maybe a few 
stewed prunes, and a piece of toast. 
But Margaret, she prefers a bowl 

THE MOLD OF YANCY 



of cereal. And Ralf, he won’t take 
either. He likes flapjacks. And the 
fellow down the street, the one 
with the big front lawn, he likes a 
kidney pie and a bottle of stout.” 

Taverner winced. Well, they 
would have to feel their way along. 
But still the audience stood ab- 
sorbing it, word after word. The 
first feeble stirrings of a radical 
idea: that each person had a dif- 
ferent set of values, a unique style 
of life. That each person might be- 
lieve, enjoy, and approve of differ- 
ent things. 

It would take time, as Sipling 
said. The massive library of tapes 
would have to be replaced ; in- 
junctions built up in each area 
would have to be broken down. A 
new type of thinking was being in- 
troduced, starting with a trite ob- 
servation about primroses. When a 
nine-year-old boy wanted to find 
out if a war was just or unjust, he 
would have to inquire into his own 
mind. There would be no ready 
answer from Yancy; a gestalt was 
already being prepared on that, 
showing that every war had been 
called just by some, unjust by 
others. 

There was one gestalt Taverner 
wished he could see. But it wouldn’t 
be around for a long time; it would 
have to wait. Yancy was going to 
change his taste in art, slowly but 
steadily. One of these days, the 
public would learn that Yancy no 
longer enjoyed pastoral calendar 
scenes. 

That now he preferred the art of 
that fifteenth century Dutch master 
of macabre and diabolical horror, 
Hieronymus Bosch. • • •

In the days just before one music was nationalistic and insti- 
marche militaire changed two gated combative feelings, and it 
worlds. Earth was weary of war, was banned. The scenes, the 



97 



sounds, the sights of antagonisms 
between men were forbidden. 

The Polonaise, the Marseillaise, 
the March of the Toys, all suffered 
the same fate. Sousa’s marches and 
Tschaikovsky’s 1812 Overture went 
the same way. Dixie and the 
Hawaiian War Chant were treated 
alike. All were relegated to tape in 
dusty archives, and their sale or 
public performance forbidden on 
pain of fine and prison sentence. 

Whatever unlawful violence 
there might be on faraway Mars, 
Earth was through with all forms 
of war and its trappings. 

Into these circumstances. Cornel 
Lorensse intruded on the night of 
December 6, 2010. He pressed his 
thin face against the steam-misted 
window of The Avatar in Nuyork 
and saw a piano standing idle in- 
side 

The Avatar was one of those 
small restaurants sunk a few feet 
below sidewalk level, which catered 
with exotic dishes to the tastes of 
a select group. It was well-popu- 
lated at this hour, and Cornel 
licked his lips hungrily at the 
epicurean delights unveiled at each 
table. 

He felt in the pocket of his worn 
coveralls. A single coin answered 
the exploration of his fingers. He 
was down to his last resource, and 
he was no nearer to finding the 
Friends than he had been when he 
landed. 

He looked again at the piano, 
hesitated, then went down the three 
steps to the restaurant’s door, 
pushed it open and went in. It was 
his good fortune that Wan Ti, own- 
er of The Avatar was receiving his 



guests in person at the moment. 

“I’ll play you a concert for a 
meal,” said Cornel, gesturing to- 
ward the piano. 

Wan Ti’s dark eyes swept over 
him, taking in the battered cover- 
alls, the earnest face, the un- 
trimmed blond hair, the slender 
hands. Wan Ti’s yellow counten- 
ance remained bland. 

“I have a piano player,” said 
Wan Ti. 

Cornel laughed, with a note of 
desperation in his tone. 

“Let me play one selection,” he 
urged. “If you want to stop me 
then, you can kick me out.” 

What Wan Ti thought could not 
be gauged from his expression, 
but he had not built his clientele 
against fierce competition by turn- 
ing his face away from the un- 
usual. He inclined his head slight- 
ly, and waved Cornel to the piano. 

Cornel sat down at the keyboard, 
brushed his hair back from his 
eyes, and flexed his long fingers. 
Thrusting the tantalizing aroma of 
food to the back of his mind, he 
played. 

The murmur of conversation in 
The Avatar faltered and died as 
the fervid melody of Beethoven’s 
Sonata Appassionata filled the air. 
It was unusual music to people ac- 
customed to hearing the more 
modern compositions of Schonberg, 
Harris and Westine. The compari- 
son of Cornel’s inspired touch to 
the mechanical renditions of Wan 
Ti’s regular piano player was no- 
ticeable even to those who were 
unfamiliar with music. 

When the final movements of the 
allegro ma non troppo faded, Cor-

nel sat back and looked toward 
Wan Ti. The proprietor cocked 
an ear toward the rare applause, 
smiled and nodded slightly. Exul- 
tantly, Cornel swung into Chopin’s 
fantasie-Impromptu and followed 
it, not pausing, with Liszt’s Wal- 
desrauschen and Schubert’s Seren- 
ode. 

The applause was just as en- 
thusiastic, but by now the hum of 
voices and the click of eating 
utensils had begun to rise again. 
Frowning slightly. Cornel hunched 
his shoulders and began a com- 
position the most musical of his 
audience had never heard before. 

Like the molten notes of the 
nightingale, the music floated and 
throbbed above the diners, almost 
a physical thing. The people in 
the restaurant paused with food 
halfway to their lips. They turned 
to see the artist, carefully, so that 
no chair would scrape. The waiters 
stopped with trays in their hands. 
Wan Ti stopped a newly arriving 
couple, his fingers at his lips. 

In the midst of the applause that 
roared through the room when 
Cornel had finished, a waiter 
tapped his shoulder. 

“Excuse me, sir,” he said. “Miss 
Meta Erosine asks that you join 
her at her table.” 

Rising and bowing to his audi- 
ence, Cornel followed the man to 
a table at the rear of the room, 
where a woman sat with her escort. 

Meta Erosine’s pale, heart- 
shaped face, with its mop of short 
black hair and luminous black 
eyes, was widely known on Earth, 
but Cornel had never been to Earth 
before. Her vibrant beauty blazed 

the patriot 



on a victim unprepared for it. 

She was clad in the cretan-can- 
can style just then becoming popu- 
lar, with breasts exposed over a 
tight bodice and a short, ruffled 
skirt gathered in front to reveal 
the knees. She smoked a long- 
stemmed, tiny-bowled pipe, studded 
with jewels. 

Beside her sat a sleek, mustached 
young man in ruffled lavender 
shirt and pink tights, his fingers 
covered with rings. 

“Sit down and eat with me, 
musician,” invited Meta. Some- 
what dubiously, Cornel took a seat 
at her right, across the table from 
the beruffled escort. 

“Meta, I wish you wouldn’t 
demean yourself by taking up with 
tramps and guttersnipes,” objected 
her companion, wrinkling his nose. 

“Leave me, Passo,” she ordered, 
waving an imperious hand. “Why 
should I sup with painted popin- 
jays when I can adore genius?” 
Passo flushed and his mouth fell 
open. But he arose and slunk quiet- 
ly away. 

“Now, musician,” said Meta, 
leaning over the table so that her 
powdered breasts brushed the 
glassware, “tell me, what was that 
last number you played?” 

“One of my own compositions,” 
he said diffidently. The odor of 
food was too much for him, and 
he leaned across the table to ap- 
propriate Passo’s untouched salad. 
“Its name is Wind in the Canals'" 
“It should be Le Vent dans les 
Canals," she said. “You should 
title your compositions in French 
— they will be more fashionable.” 
“I don’t know French,” he said. 



99 




munching a stick of celery. “We 
don’t speak French on Mars.” 

She laughed, a laugh like the 
music of his playing. 

“You will, my genius,” she prom- 
ised him. Her eyes ran over his 
lean face, his unkempt hair. “You 
look as though you could use shel- 
ter and clothing. Come home with 
me tonight. I shall give your genius 
to the world.” 



C ORNEL never had experienced 
such luxury as was his in the 
apartment Meta assigned to him in 
her magnificent home in Jersi. He 
had his personal servant. New 
clothes were waiting for him. A 
barber cut his hair when he had 
finished a hot, scented bath, and 
the big bed in which he slept was 
soft as down. 

Meta asked no information of 
him until they met at a late break- 
fast the next morning. There, beau- 
tiful in translucent white negligee, 
she sipped her coffee and asked 
questions. 

“I came from Mars to get help 
for my people,” he said. “We need 
guns and supplies, food and oxygen 
equipment.” 

“You’re one of the Gharax 
rebels?” she asked. 

“Rebels?” He snorted. “We’re 
free people, fighting for our free- 
dom. We want self-government, 
we want to own our land and our 
homes, we want the right to rule 
our own lives.” 

“That’s guaranteed in the Con- 
stitution,” said Meta. 

“Earth’s Constitution. Mars isn’t 
Earth. The Mars Corporation con- 

100 



trols botn spaceports. It owns all 
business and industry on Mars. It’s 
milking the planet dry of resources 
and profits, and it’s set up a com- 
pany government that makes the 
people of Mars no better than 
slaves.” 

He smiled a bitter smile. 

“Earth’s government protects the 
freedom of Earth’s people,” he 
said, “but the people of Earth 
don’t know what’s happening on 
Mars. The Mars Corporation has 
its senators and representatives, 
bought and paid for, so the Earth 
government sends troops and sup- 
plies to Mars to fight the battles of 
the Mars Corporation. We aren’t 
rebels, we’re fighting for our just 
freedom.” 

“If the Mars Corporation con- 
trols the spaceports, how did you 
get to Earth?” she demanded. 

“We have three battered ships 
hidden in the desert near Syrtis 
Major,” said Gomel. “It takes a 
long time for us to get fuel to take 
one of them up, but they thought 
it worthwhile if I could get to 
Earth and get help for my people.” 

“Why you?” 

“My music is well known on 
Mars, and my people know that 
the people of Earth love music. 
Here on Earth, where there is 
peace and prosperity, people pay 
to hear good music and good mu- 
sicians. Our plan was for me to 
give great concerts and at each 
concert ask the people of Earth to 
help their Martian brothers gain 
their freedom.” 

“A good way to get arrested,” 
said Meta dryly. “You’d be con- 
victed of inciting military action 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




and sentenced to prison in any 
court of Earth.” 

“I didn’t know that, but I sup- 
pose the Friends would have a 
way. 

“The Friends?” 

“The Friends of Mars. It’s an 
organization of Earth people try- 
ing to help us. I suppose it must 
be a secret and illegal organization, 
for I found that the man I was 
supposed to get in touch with had 
been arrested, and I haven’t been 
able to find out anything more 
about the Friends.” 

“Such an organization would be 
illegal on Earth,” said Meta. 
“Come here, Gomel. I want to 
show you something.” 

Taking him by the arm, she led 
him from the breakfast room to a 
terrace overlooking a snowy valley. 
She moved closer to him in the 
chill wind that billowed her thin 
garments around her, and waved 
her hand at the scene below them. 

“This is Earth,” she said. “Look 
at those mountain peaks, the blue 
sky and the white clouds. In sum- 
mer, this valley is clothed with 
green, and warm breezes bring the 
scent of flowers to this terrace. 
Have you ever seen anything like 
this on Mars?” 

“No,” he said softly. “Mars is 
always cold and dusty, and the sky 
is nearly black.” 

“Cornel,” she said softly, you’re 
a great musician. Mars is rough 
frontier territory, and the frontier 
has no place for music. Last night 
you saw what your music could 
mean here. 

“Forget Mars. You belong to 
Earth.” 



T he METEORIC rise of Cornel 
Lorensse to fame in 201 1 and 
2012 now commands a full column 
in the Encyclopaedia Terrestriana. 
Bmshed off in a single sentence in 
the encyclopaedia, but much dis- 
cussed in that day, was his close 
relationship with Meta Erosine, his 
patroness. 

For half a decade, wealthy, beau- 
tiful Meta Erosine had been the 
toast of Earth. She was an actress, 
a painter, a singer, a socialite, and 
she had changed men almost as 
often as she changed the dresses she 
wore. Her face was familiar in 
newspapers and on television 
screens, her husky songs were on a 
million recording tapes, her color- 
ful antics were the grist for maga- 
zine articles and the subject of 
denunciations from the pulpit. 

In Cornel she seemed to have 
found a vehicle for all the burning 
fire of her energy. She pushed him, 
she groomed him, she threw the 
power of her wealth behind him. 
His slender figure clad in a black 
velvet suit sat at polished pianos 
on a hundred stages; and for each 
concert, the auditoriums and the 
audiences were bigger. 

Meta was with him on these 
concert tours; and between tours 
he stayed in seclusion at the big 
house in Jersi, putting into music 
his memories of his native Mars. 
Each tour introduced to the world 
the new compositions of Gomel 
Lorensse. 

What he wrote and played was 
the haunting music of the deserts, 
the canals and the marches. Into 
his music he poured the loneliness 
of the red sands and the violence of 



THE PATRIOT 



101 




the desert winds, the beauty of 
sable skies jeweled with enormous 
stars, the happiness of the helmeted 
traveler when he reaches the green 
valleys of the canals, the hopes and 
joys of human lovers gathered in 
bubble-like domes amid the chill 
wastelands. 

He did not, as Meta had wanted 
to, give his compositions French 
titles. He named them as he would 
have named them on Mars: The 
Desert Wanderer, Swift Phobos, 
Marsh Gardens, names that were 
strange to Earth, but were familiar 
themes of his own people. 

His melodies took music-loving 
Earth by storm. They burst upon a 
world in which 20th century dis- 
sonance had strangled 19th century 
romanticism, like flowers in a gar- 
den of crystal. It was Cornel 
Lorensse and those pioneer com- 
posers who avidly aped him who 
began the 21st century Renaissance 
in music. 

Without shame. Cornel lived on 
the largesse of his patroness, for 
his growing fees and royalties all 
went for one purpose. He had 
found the society called the Friends 
of Mars, and everything that he 
earned he poured into their coffers 
to finance privateer space vessels 
able to elude the Mars Corpora- 
tion’s company-owned warships 
and to keep a thin line of supplies 
flowing to the Free Martian people 
scattered in their desert strong- 
holds. 

Like any secret society in a hos- 
tile culture, the Friends of Mars 
maintained dissociated chapters, 
connected by the slenderest and 
most carefully guarded lines of 

102 



communication. Cornel knew of 
only one chapter, in Nuyork, and 
to this he took his contributions 
when he was between concert tours. 

During one of those visits, late 
in the summer of 2012, Javan 
Tomlin, chief of the chapter, told 
him that all he contributed was 
still not enough for Mars to be- 
come free. 

“Our base of support isn’t broad 
enough,” said Javan. “Ships cost 
money, fuel costs money, supplies 
cost money. Guns and ammunition 
are most expensive of all, because 
military weapons are illegal. No 
one man can support such an 
operation, even when he makes the 
kind of money you’re making.” 
There were half a dozen of the 
Friends of Mars, besides Cornel 
and Javan, in the meeting room. 
The others nodded agreement at 
Javan’s words. 

“None of us are wealthy and we 
can’t contribute much but our time 
and work,” said one of them. “The 
wealthy people all sympathize with 
the Mars Corporation.” 

“That’s too much of a blanket 
indictment,” said Javan. “The 
Mars Corporation controls the 
spacelines to Mars, and what little 
information comes back to Earth is 
censored and heavily propagan- 
dized in their favor. Most people 
don’t know what’s happening on 
Mars. Our people need a powerful 
radio transmitter to broadcast to 
Earth, Cornel.” 

Cornel shook his head. 

“What information the people 
of Earth get must be disseminated 
on Earth,” he said. “Powerful ra- 
dio equipment would take up space 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




and weight needed for arms. Be- 
sides, the Mars Corporation forces 
have air power and directional 
finders. They’d bomb a permanent 
installation before it had a chance 
to send out its second broadcast.” 

“All we can do is work and 
hope,” said Javan gloomily. “If we 
had a fleet of about a dozen good 
ships, we might be able to swing 
it, but we have only two and a 
third abuilding.” 

“There are three on Mars,” Cor- 
nel pointed out. 

“One was blasted in space last 
week, and they’re too old to lift 
more than half cargo, anyhow,” 
said Javan. “The corporation con- 
trols the Earth space stations, 
through the government, and we 
have to use direct drive stage- 
rockets.” 

Cornel left, not feeling very op- 
timistic. At the curb outside the 
club, he looked up and down the 
street for a cab to take him to the 
heliport where his copter was 
parked. 

There was no cab in sight, but 
from a side street a little distance 
away a long black limousine swung 
into the boulevard, sped swiftly to 
the club entrance and halted. The 
back door opened and Meta leaned 
out, beckoning. 

“Get in, quick!” she urged. 
“We’ve got to get away from here!” 

Not understanding, Cornel got 
in. The car roared away with a 
burst of acceleration that thrust 
him back on the cushions beside 
her. 

“What in Saturn?” he de- 
manded and turned to look out the 
rear window. 



A squad of police cars was con- 
verging on the club he had just 
left. Sirens screaming, they pulled 
up, blocking the street, and armed 
officers in plain clothes leaped out 
and hurried into the club. 

Meta put her arms around his 
neck and drew his head down to 
her lap. 

“They’re raiding the Friends of 
Mars,” she said, and a soothing 
note crept into her tone. “You’re 
safe, darling. They don’t know you 
were there.” 

“But how did they know? How 
did you know?” he demanded, 
struggling unsuccessfully to free 
himself from the imprisonment of 
her embrace. The sound of the 
sirens had died in the distance be- 
hind them. 

“I told them,” Meta said firmly. 
“Where do you think I get the 
wealth you’ve been living on, dar- 
ling? I own a fourth of the stock 
of the Mars Corporation.” 



T he next morning. Cornel 
had disappeared. Meta was 
frantic. Every available agency was 
pressed into service, but Nuyork 
was a city of fifteen million people 
and Cornel had vanished. 

It was two weeks before he re- 
turned. When he did, he was gaunt 
and grim and dirty as he had been 
the night Meta had first seen him 
in The Avatar. 

“Darling, why did you run 
away?” she asked, holding him 
close in her arms. 

“I came back because I love 
you,” he answered tiredly. “But I 
came back, too, because I love 



THE PATRIOT 



103 




Mars more, Meta. I had to go 
away and think what I was to do.” 

“It’s all right now,” she soothed. 
“You understand that the odds 
against your rebels are just too 
heavy. You have a life on Earth to 
live.” 

“Yes,” he said in a low voice. 
“But there’ll be no concerts this 
season, Meta.” 

“Cornel, you can’t cancel now! 
The schedule’s all arranged.” 

“I shall cancel,” he said firmly. 
“You want me to live on Earth, 
so you must let me learn about 
Earth. I intend to spend this win- 
ter studying psychosociology and 
terrestrial law — and composing.” 

Her brow cleared. 

“If you’ll continue your com- 
posing, it’s all right,” she said. 
“Next season’s concerts can be the 
greatest ever. I’ll pay off the pro- 
moters, darling.” 

So it was done. That season the 
admirers of Cornel Lorensse’s 
music had to content themselves 
with recordings. Cornel himself 
spent his time quietly at Nuyork 
University and at the house in 
Jersi. 

As she had said, the 2013 concert 
season was Cornel’s greatest, right 
from the start. In part it was due 
to Meta’s own efforts, for she spent 
tremendous sums of money and 
utilized her own famous personality 
to great advantage in promotional 
work. 

Across the nation, across the 
the world, the tour swept, snow- 
balling constantly. Christmas of 
2013, and Cornel Lorensse intro- 
duced a great new hymn. From the 
Polar Caps, New Year’s Day, 2014, 



and The Years to Come was intro- 
duced by radio and television at a 
thousand parties. 

There had been some quibbling 
at the beginning of the season, be- 
cause the business directors of the 
tour had wanted to combine the 
drawing power of Cornel’s name 
with that of well-known concert 
orchestras. Cornel insisted on 
using his own orchestra, built up 
carefully during his year of study. 
As the season progressed, it be- 
came apparent that Cornel’s name 
alone was enough of a drawing 
card. 

February, March, 2014, and 
every network had bought into 
the schedule. When Cornel Lor- 
ensse’s weekly concerts were on the 
air, there was nothing else on radio 
or television, anywhere in the 
world, except on the non-affiliated 
local stations. April passed trium- 
phantly, and the final concert was 
scheduled for May 15 in Rome. 

The D’Annunzio Colosseum, built 
in 1971, was filled to capacity. 
Careful staging was necessary, to 
care for all the cameras and micro- 
phones of the various television 
and radio networks. 

The program was not a long 
one: Debussy’s Clair de Lune, 

Lorensse’s Swift Phohos, Beeth- 
oven’s Moonlight Sonata, Waco’s 
Variations on a Theme by Altdown 
— and the words “To be an- 
nounced.” It was a familiar phrase, 
and it always meant the introduc- 
tion of a new composition by Cor- 
nel Lorensse. 

The concert went smoothly be- 
fore — how many listeners? Fifty 
million? A hundred million? Two 



104 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




hundred million? On the great, 
brightly lighted stage Cornel played 
the concert grand with superb 
mastery and bowed to the applause, 
a pale, solemn figure in black. 

When he had acknowledged the 
acclamation after the Waco piece, 
the audience waited in hushed si- 
lence for his announcement of the 
final number on the program. 

“The composition I am about to 
play is the culmination of my 
musical career,” Cornel said quietly 
into the microphones. “It is a prod- 
uct of my studies, not only of 
music, but of psychosociology and 
law. 

“In hypnoschool last year, I 
studied the effects of music on the 
human mind. It is a new field, and 
many of you are aware of it only 
through the fact that certain kinds 
of music are forbidden by law as 
dangerous to peace on Earth. 

“I have tried to go into it much 
more deeply than that.” 

He smiled bitterly. 

“Most of you know that I am a 
Martian, one of the so-called Mar- 
tian rebels,” he said. “I think much 
of the appeal of my music to you 
has been its Martian quality. To 
the people of Earth, most of whom 
have never seen Mars, it has pic- 
tured my planet. 

“My latest composition will do 
so even more graphically, for it has 
been composed on a deliberate psy- 
chological foundation. This song 
will show Mars to you. It will show 
you my people, and what my people 
want. 

“I may add that I have studied 
the law carefully, and I can assure 
you that this composition is not 

THE PATRIOT 



military in nature. 

“Ladies and gentlemen of Earth, 
accompanied by the orchestra I 
shall now play The Martianne,^^ 

In the control rooms of the au- 
ditorium and of relay points 
throughout the world, censors, 
vaguely alarmed by Comers words, 
hovered with their fingers on cut- 
off keys. Then they relaxed. Cornel 
had told the truth. There was noth- 
ing of a military nature in the 
opening bars of The Martianne. 

It was a theme handled, but less 
competently, in some of his other 
compositions. The woodwinds be- 
gan on a soft, sad note, gradually 
rising in power, like the thin winds 
that moaned across the Martian 
desert sands. Into this, almost in- 
audibly at first, crept the clear 
piano notes that marked the cau- 
tious, wondering intrusion of hu- 
manity on an alien world. 

The drums beat the construction 
of the domes, the horns blared the 
landing of the spaceships, the vio- 
lins cried the hopes of the men 
and women who went to Mars to 
find a new life. It was a picture in 
music, so skilfully drawn that when 
the first discordance crept in, every 
listener could identify it instantly 
as the age-old greed of man seek- 
ing to subvert frontier freedoms 
to his own selfish ends. 

When the blare of trumpets and 
the ruffle of drums thundered into 
the final militant theme of The 
Martianne, every listener knew it 
bespoke the valiant fight of men 
for freedom against an oppressor. 

Every listener knew what he 
heard was music that had been

backward. I tried to be forward. Everything went for food, its 



107 






growth, collection, and processing. 
The big freighters, some of them, 
had atomic piles, but that power 
was impossibly clumsy and expen- 
sive for smaller boats. So they came 
by air in the usual inspection heli- 
copter. The pilot dropped her in 
the cove right alongside the wharf 
and made fast. Three men stepped 
onto the planks. They had the 
wheat sheaf insignia of the WFI on 
their overcoat arms and caps, and 
they looked cold and bored. A small 
sea sucked at the pilings and the 
helicopter rose and fell, grating 
against the wharf. I looked at the 
pilot and said, “Better put your 
chafing gear out if you intend stay- 
ing a while.” We all watched while 
the pilot put a few kapoks at the 
tight spots. Then he looked at a 
notebook and said, “You George 
Arthur Henry?” 

I said, “Gall me George.” 

This inspector was the usual 
type: tired from long hours, bored 
from doing nothing on a weary 
round of food inspections. He 
hunched his shoulders against the 
wind. 

I said, “It’s warmer inside.” 

They followed me into the kitch- 
en of the house. All three of them 
started to sit down, then stopped, 
and walked over to the table in 
perfect step. They looked at the 
cold remains of my breakfast eggs. 
The WFI inspector shoved his hat 
up and said, “Eggs.” The others 
nodded, wordless with wonder. 
Then the inspector said, “Chick- 
ens?” 

“Where,” I said, “do you think 
I got the eggs?” 

The little man alongside the in- 

108 



spector came to life. In three dex- 
trous movements he had glasses on, 
a notebook in his hand, and stylus 
poised. “What do you feed them?” 
he inquired eagerly. 

“Seeds,” I said, “insects, chopped 
up garter snakes, mussels, ground 
up oyster shells. You boys have all 
the grain.” 

There was an excited light in the 
little man’s eyes. He hurried out to 
a broken down shed to examine the 
chickens. 

That left two of them. The in- 
spector continued to gaze at the re- 
mains on the plate in a dreamy 
way. The other man straightened 
his big shoulders, looked at me, and 
said, jerking his thumb toward the 
shed, “Mr. Garter’s an ecologist. He 
just came along for the trip. He’s 
on his way to the Government Ex- 
perimental Farm over at Murdock. 
I’m a government sociologist. I was 
sent here to have a talk with you. 
My name is Ranson.” 

“Sure. Sit down. I guess I’m 
licked, but there’s no use making 
a rumpus about it.” 

I turned to the inspector whose 
eyes were still caught in the egg 
plate. I said, “Ever taste them?” 
“Once,” he said, in a far away 
voice. I went to the cupboard and 
came back with a paper bag full of 
eggs and put it in his hands. He 
held them as if someone had just 
given him the wheat sheaf badge of 
merit. 

“I won’t be needing these after 
our little talk, I expect. Take them 
home to the kiddies.” 

He smiled, looked at the sociol- 
ogists, who grinned back and 
nodded. The inspector walked very 

VARLEY LANG 




carefully out of the back door and 
down to the wharf to stow his eggs 
in the helicopter. 

Ranson shifted in his chair. He 
said, “That was very nice of you, 
Mr. Henry.” 

“George,” I said. 

“Against the law, of course.” 
There was a smile around his eyes. 
“Are you against the law, George?” 
“Yes. No use bluffing. You know 
the story. All the waters and every- 
thing in them are WFI. All the land 
and everything on it. I don’t like 
packaged food. I like real food. I 
don’t like my oysters, crabs, clams, 
fish minced up and blended with 
chick weed, cereals, yeast, algae, 
plankton, and flavored to taste a 
little like steak. And plenty of others 
feel the same. I have a market.” 
“An illegal market.” 

“Yes,” I said. “By God, if you 
had told my father, before I was 
born, that the oysters he tonged 
could not be eaten as oysters, he’d 
have laughed in your face. And if 
you had told him he wouldn’t even 
be allowed to tong them, he’d have 
cussed you good and proper!” 
“People have to be fed. The only 
way we can do it is to combine the 
total food resources of the world, 
process and package them, and do it 
as efficiently as possible. That means 
absolute control of all food sources 
and their harvesting. You could 
work for WFI,^ George. It would be 
important work.” 

“I know. It’s so important noth- 
ing else gets done. Have you seen 
the roads around here? Half the 
bridges are down across Charles 
Neck and Walter Hook. You can’t 
get gas. You can’t get telephones, 

ECOLOGY ON ROLLINS ISLAND 



and if you happen to have one, it 
doesn’t work half the time. And the 
busses don’t run any more. And — ” 

Ranson held up his hand. “It’s 
an emergency, George. You have 
to realize that. It’s been building up 
for a long time, long before your 
father worked the oyster beds in 
Murdock Sound.” 

“There’s another thing,” I said. 
“Before you fellows closed the 
Sound, I was independent. I had 
my own boat and I made my own 
way. Now you put your WFI scoops 
in the Sound and the whole job is 
done in a month or two. And who 
are the watermen? A couple of 
clerks to every scoop who turn a 
valve every once in a while and 
draw their packaged food, clothing, 
and entertainment once a week. Do 
you call that a job? Why, those food 
clerks couldn’t even lift a pair of 
thirty foot rakes, let alone tong with 
them.” 

“We get more oysters, George, 
and in less time, and we do it 
scientifically.” 

Ranson tapped his notebook with 
the stylus and he looked out of the 
kitchen window. He was giving me 
time to cool off. He’d been kind and 
patient when he didn’t have to be 
either. With his job he had no time 
to sit and reason with a one man 
resistance movement. He had no 
time for anything but food, and 
organizing society to keep it grub- 
bing incessantly for food, and, at 
the same time, to keep society as 
orderly and contented as possible. I 
was not orderly and I was not con- 
tented. But I was just one man, not 
society. I cooled off. 

I said, “Look, Ranson. It’s like 

109 




this. I know you’re right. I’ve had 
a look around, and I’ve thought 
about it some. The figures are with 
you : too many men and not enough 
food. Only thing is, even from your 
point of view, I’m not fit for WFI. 
I have to be on my own. There 
ought to be somewhere, someplace 
for a man, instead of a food clerk 
— ” I trailed off unhappily. 

“I’m afraid you have no alter- 
native, George. You are a criminal 
in the eyes of the WFI. Either you 
will work for WFI or you will be 
punished.” He paused. 

“I won’t work for them.” 

Garter, the ecologist, burst in at 
the door, slammed his gloves down 
in the middle of the kitchen table. 
“Ranson, you never saw anything 
like it. Fifty in the flock, two roost- 
ers, all in fine shape. Lice of course, 
some bone malformation in the legs. 
But healthy.” 

He began to ask me dozens of 
questions, but Ransom interrupted. 

“I need your help. Carter, and 
time’s wasting. Among other dep- 
redations, George Henry, here, has 
been robbing government oyster 
beds, trapping government crabs, 
netting government fish, presum- 
ably at night I needn’t add that he 
has a ready and lucrative market. 
In effect, he refuses to cease his 
depredations, he refuses to join the 
WFI, and he is generally uncooper- 
ative.” 

Garter said, “uncooperative,” in 
an absent way. He dragged his mind 
away from a flock of fifty fowl liv- 
ing in a most unusual ecology, nar- 
rowed his eyes, and asked a shrewd 
question. 

no 



“How did he get there?” 
“What?” 

“To the beds.” 

Ranson said, “Where did you get 
the gas, George?” 

“I didn’t. Took the engine out, 
put in a well and center-board, 
shipped a mast, and rigged her for 
sail. She’s tucked away up in 
Marshwater Greek.” 

They were astounded. Nobody 
had sailed pleasure craft for a gen- 
eration: no leisure and no money 
for such a waste of time; and sail 
craft were too inefl&cient for food 
collecting. 

“My God, George,” Ranson said, 
“you’re a living anachronism!” 
Carter nodded. He adjusted his 
glasses, looked at me, and said 
quietly, “He is also an able man.” 
“His abilities will be largely 
wasted in a Penal Food Processing 
Plant,” Ranson said grimly. 

“Oh, I agree, I agree.” Garter 
nodded his head emphatically. 
“The wrong environment entirely. 
No scope. No initiative.” He gave 
me a glance of understanding that 
warmed me right through and also 
had the unfortunate effect of taking 
some of the starch out of me. I had 
been prepared for hostility and in- 
difference. I stood up and walked 
to the sink for a glass of water I 
didn’t want. 

“Now,” Carter said, talking to 
Ranson, “you take the way he 
walks. Notice how he swings his 
arms, with his hands a little for- 
ward, as if ready to grip, and the 
tilt of his head, alert, watchful. You 
don’t see that often. Different atti- 
tude, different environment.” 
Ranson sighed. “Get down to 

VARLEY LANG 




business.” 

“Yes. There’s always this terrible 
lack of manpower, machine power, 
everything, all swallowed up in 
food. And besides, the men can’t 
stand those bird stations. Too 
lonely. Can’t meet an emergency. 
Four of them died on Rollins Is- 
land three winters ago when the 
power plant failed. Just sat there 
and froze. Terrible thing. Had to 
install emergency two-way radios; 
need the equipment elsewhere.” 
“They died of loneliness, if you 
ask me,” Ranson said. 

Carter nodded. “And no gas a- 
vailable for boat inspection. Heli- 
copter too wasteful for a single 
station. Put George out there with 
one or two others. Could you sail 
out? Seaworthy? Big enough?” 

I said yes. 

“Good. Food processing all done 
by machines. Just feed birds in. 
Take up to half the colony of young 
birds when bred, half the old ones 
when coming to nest. Regular in- 
spection of tern colonies by sail, 
your boat. Helicopter lands June 
twenty, small freighter in July to 
load processed birds in Rollins Har- 
bor. Just the thing.” 

He took off his glasses to show 
that the problem had been solved. 

“Look,” Ranson said. “I don’t 
have anything against George per- 
sonally. I want him to be useful and 
contented. If he can’t be contented, 
then at least I want him to be use- 
ful, instead of wasteful. Robbing 
government food resources is a 
^ave offense, but even that doesn’t 
justify putting him down in the 
middle of a pile of excrement where 
no ordinary man can breath for 

ECOLOGY ON ROLLINS ISLAND 



more than a few minutes without 
stifling.” 

“Healthy,” Carter said. “Healthy. 
It does stink. That’s one reason we 
have such trouble keeping the sta- 
tions manned.” 

“Boys,” I said. “What is this pile 
of dung I’m supposed to sit on? 
And what birds? And why?” 

Carter explained. In the desper- 
ate search for food, the sea birds 
were now being subjected to an an- 
nual harvest. From various nesting 
places along all the ocean coasts in 
the world, birds were harvested, to 
say nothing of their eggs, in large 
numbers. It was simply a matter of 
catching and killing the birds, gath- 
ering their eggs, and feeding the 
processing hoppers with same. 
These foods were later shipped to 
Food Processing Plants to be 
added to other harvests and pack- 
aged for consumption. In some 
cases, more specialized processing 
was necessary, as with the fulmars 
on Rollins Island. The fulmars were 
much prized because their alimen- 
tary system contained an especially 
stinking oil rich in fat and vitamin 
A. In their case, no eggs were col- 
lected, since they bred only once 
in a season, and the birds were 
separately processed to retrieve the 
oil. 

Literally millions of sea birds and 
their eggs were cropped yearly from 
nesting sites on the east coast of 
North America alone. It was a 
regular and assured source of food 
on an enormous scale the world 
over. The thousands of tons of ex- 
crement were also gathered every 
five years to be used in food pro- 
cessing and in agriculture. It was 

in 




the policy of the WFI to waste 
nothing and to use everything. 

The cropping of the young birds 
took place in the spring and early 
summer, depending on the species. 
The adult birds were trapped by 
various devices when they returned 
to their nests. Over-cropping was 
carefully avoided to insure a steady 
annual production, 

“If it’s the island or a Penal Food 
Plant, I’ll take the island. I’m a 
waterman, not a bird collector. At 
least I’ll get a chapce to use the 
boat once in a while.” 

Both the WFI men looked re- 
lieved. Then Ranson put a ques- 
tion. 

“Do you know of anyone eke 
around here who might be fitted for 
such work? I’m not asking you to 
inform. I know there’s been a good 
deal of discontent in this Sound 
region, which is one reason why I’m 
here. The island may be a solution 
for other misfits as well.” 

I thought it over. “The Jackson 
boys aren’t very happy. They were 
the best men with drift nets this 
Sound has ever seen. Now they sit 
on stools all day long and watch a 
row of bottles pass in front of lights. 
Once in a while they lift a bottle 
out of the line and put it aside. 
They get very drunk every night on 
some stuff they make out of berries 
and dandelions from the marsh.” 
Ranson sighed. Carter again 
passed a warming look of complete 
understanding, and nodded en- 
couragement. 

“Then there’s Pete Younger. He 
was a trapper before WFI closed 
the muskrat areas. He turns a valve 
several hundred times a day in the 

112 



Small Fish Processor. He oils his 
traps and talks to himself. He may 
be too far gone. I think he is.” 
“Anyone else?” 

“Others. But the WFI has a 
bight on them for good, I guess. 
They were men, once.” 

“Are the Jackson men married?” 
I smiled. “No. We’re dying out.” 
Garter chuckled. 



I T WAS a twenty-five mile sail to 
Rollins Island. The Jackson boys 
and I loaded the boat with clothing 
mostly. Food was stored on the is- 
land. I took along four pairs of 
oyster rakes, I didn’t have the heart 
to leave them behind. And Bill and 
Joy took a huge ball of linen twine, 
ropes, corks, rings, all the makings 
for a drift net. 

Unexpectedly, Carter showed up 
at the last minute by helicopter to 
see us off. He jumped up on the 
wharf smiling. 

“About those chickens,” he said, 
“they’re condemned stock of course. 
Better take them along. And keep 
an eye on them. Want to know how 
they make out in a new environ- 
ment.” 

Then he took me aside and 
handed me a small book. 

“Lot of information in this. Writ- 
ten by a small animal ecologist. 
Read it. Read it carefully. Think 
about it. Read it again, and think 
some more. Got that?” 

I said, “Sure. I’ll read it.” I had 
the notion he was trying to get 
something over without actually 
coming out with it flat, so I listened 
carefully. 

He paused for a while, wiping 
VARLEY LANG 




his glasses and pursing his lips. 

“That island’s not right for ful- 
mars and gannets. Wrong environ- 
ment. Never have multiplied as they 
should. Whole thing should be con- 
centrated north. Plenty of cliff sites 
north. None here. Won’t do. Terns, 
yes. Fulmars and gannets, no. 
Trouble is, WFI is tenacious. Stu- 
pidly so. It works, they say. I tell 
them it works badly. It’s going to 
take a lot to move them : total fail- 
ure of a colony or two. 

“You’re intelligent, George. Put 
two and two together. Wish you 
luck.” 

He shook my hand quickly and 
jumped into the helicopter. Bill and 
Joy had to call me twice before I 
could come out of a trance of be- 
wildered speculation. In a daze I 
helped the boys load our last piece 
of equipment: a huge barrel of 
salt they had pilfered from the local 
Food Plant. 



T he island is big, about five 
by fifteen miles, and it must 
have been a fine piece of land. It 
still was, even though mucked ev- 
erywhere with white-to-greenish 
bird dung. There were steep hills 
on the mainland side, marshes to 
seaward, and in the middle natural 
meadowland broken by woods con- 
taining pine, and some beech and 
maple. We moored in a small but 
fairly deep harbor at a wharf for 
loading foods. Our barracks stood 
just off the wharf. In addition to all 
the necessities, there was a two-way 
radio, marked “Use in emergency 
only”, and a handbook with infor- 
mation on approximate numbers of 

ECOLOGY ON ROLLINS ISLAND 



birds to be taken, locations of nest- 
ing sites, and so on. Equipment, in- 
cluding snares and nets, was stored 
in an equipment room. And there 
was a storeroom containing pack- 
aged foods, no freezing or cooling 
necessary for preservation. 

Behind the barracks stood a 
warehouse for storing processed 
birds, and a shop with the proces- 
sors themselves. Everything looked 
orderly and efficient. A small plant 
supplied us with light and heat 
and power for the machines. 

We arrived in November. By De- 
cember, the first sea birds began to 
return to their nesting sites, a few 
at a time. Soon we were so busy 
snagging them as they came to land 
that we had little time for anything 
but work and sleep. Even so. Bill 
took the time to salt several dozens 
of gannets and fulmars for future 
eating, and he was looking forward 
to the eggs. 

Spring and early summer soon 
rolled around, and we were collect- 
ing young birds, the nestlings. So 
it went. 

I can’t say any of us liked the 
work. For one thing we all sickened 
of the endless slaughter. For an- 
other, the stench and dirt were 
overwhelming. The island should 
have been a fine place for living. 
There were sheltered spots for 
houses, a small harbor, woodlots, 
meadows for cattle and pigs, some 
bottom land for food crops, the 
sea for fish — a fine location; but 
it was ruined by birds. It was a 
slimy, stinking hell. 

The birds flew everywhere in 
huge flocks, especially in the morn- 
ing when the gannets and fulmars 

113 




came back from fishing at sea. Ex- 
crement fell from the sky like a 
stinking sleet. We couldn’t get away 
from the smell or the smell away 
from us. It was in our clothing, 
hair, under our fingernails. No 
watermen ever washed so often or 
so thoroughly as we did, but the 
stink remained. We lost weight and 
appetite steadily, for the packaged 
fo^ tasted of excrement soon after 
it was opened, or seemed to, which 
is just as bad. 

However, by the end of June 
most of the birds had left, and we 
had our helicopter inspection. The 
same man who was fascinated by 
the cold remains of a couple of eggs 
in my kitchen was on this route, 
and we cooked three or four of our 
chickens. His enormous appetite 
sharpened ours, and we had a 
feast. He was almost tearfully grate- 
ful. By July, the freighter had put 
in, loaded, and left. For the first 
time in many months, we were un- 
occupied. 

Bill and Joy immediately set 
about knitting a large drift net. 
They were happily excited at the 
prospect of gilling large numbers 
of government fish. As for me, I sat 
down to read a book on small an- 
imal ecology. 

I read that book through three 
times. I kept at it night and day, 
and it was the hardest work I’ve 
ever done, because I wasn’t read- 
ing just to pass the time. There was 
a message in that book, I was sure 
of it, a message from Carter, a man 
I liked and trusted. 

By the time I began to get a 
glimmering of an idea as to what 
Garter’s message was, the boys had 

114 



their net knitted and hung. I went 
back to the book to find out what 
to do about this idea, and the boys 
sailed out to drift the net. I waited 
for them in a sweat of impatience. 
They came back at dawn the next 
day with a boat load of food fish. I 
met them at the wharf. 

“Bill,” I said, “what are you go- 
ing to do with that load of fish?” 
Bill looked at the fish. He said 
with slow and tremendous satisfac- 
tion, “I aim to eat them fish, 
George Henry.” 

“Bill,” I said, “not even you can 
eat all those fish. I’ve got a scheme. 
Save back some of the fish, sure. Let 
Joy smoke a few even. But take 
the rest into Murdock tonight and 
sell them to Hornsby. He used to 
buy my oysters. He’ll buy your fish.” 
“What for?” Bill asked. 

“Get some bootleg gin,” I said. 
“That makes sense. What else?” 
“Rats,” I said. “I want rats. Buy 
some traps or get Pete Younger to 
make some. Not muskrats. Bam 
rats. As many as you can catch.” 
“Fish,” Bill said. “Fish for rats. 
Boy, the birds has got you.” 

He gave in after a while, more 
to keep me good natured than for 
any other reason, that and the gin. 
He came back with two dozen live, 
healthy specimens, and watched 
with an open mouth as I let them 
loose. 



T he months passed, and I 

was worried. To drive the prob- 
lem from my head, I took the boat 
out and surveyed the shallow waters 
off the island. I found something. 
I found a bed of oysters in broken 

VARLEY LANG 




rock, a bed not marked on WFI 
charts, because you could see it 
hadn’t been worked for a long 
time. Later, I located clam beds 
on the marshy side of the island. 
The damn place was a paradise, or 
might be, once those birds were 
cut down, but I couldn’t eliminate 
them by sheer slaughter because of 
the WFI. 

There didn’t seem to be many 
rats around. December came and 
all the filthy, stinking work with 
it, and still no rats. Once in a while, 
eggs would be missing from occu- 
pied nests, and that was all. Gulls 
could have gotten those. We toiled 
through stinking February, foul 
March, odiferous April, and evil- 
smelling May. Still no rats. 

I sent Bill back to the mainland 
for more; and by September, rats 
were everywhere. Bill looked at me 
from his bunk one night and said, 
“I hope you’re satisfied.” 

I was more than that. I was ter- 
rified. They absolutely swarmed. 
It was impossible to wdk from the 
barracks to the boat at mid-day 
without having to kick rats off the 
path. They consumed most of the 
non-metallic gear in the boat, in- 
cluding the sail. So far, they hadn’t 
gnawed a way into our barracks 
store room, or we’d have literally 
starved to death. 

“Boys,” I said, “just sit tight. 
Wait till December. These rats are 
the best friends you ever had. 
They’re going to make this island 
livable. No more stink and stench.” 

“What,” said Bill, “are you go- 
ing to do with the rats when the 
birds are gone?” 

Joy merely moaned. 

ECOLOGY ON ROLLINS ISLAND 



“We’ll kill them.” 

“If they don’t get us first,” Bill 
said. 

It was an awesome and bloody 
slaughter. The fulmars and gannets, 
most of the gulls, some of the terns, 
were either wiped out or harried 
off the island in a single season. 
And the island became a heaving, 
moving, revolting mass of rats, and 
nothing but rats. They attacked us 
on sight, from sheer hunger. Not a 
blade of grass grew anywhere on 
the island, and rats are not grass 
eaters as an ordinary thing. There 
was one hopeful sign. They were 
beginning to eat each other. 

Day after day we were caged in 
our barracks. The constant squeal- 
ing and scratching under the bar- 
racks was bad enough. What made 
us desperate was the fact that they 
had gnawed a way into the store 
room and most of the packaged 
food was gone. We still had some 
smoked fish hung on the rafters, 
and a few salted fulmars in the 
barrel, but that was all. It was then 
that we remembered the two-way 
radio, marked “Use in emergency 
only”. Bill said, after weighing all 
the evidence coolly and carefully, 
that this here, in his opinion, was 
an emergency. 

I got WFI mainland and finally 
persuaded them to put me in touch 
with Carter, Bird Stations Ecolo- 
gist. I told him we were having 
a little trouble with the genus Rat- 
tus, and would he, for God’s sake, 
do something about it, quick. I can 
still near him laughing. It was a 
while before he could speak at all. 

“Keep them at bay, general. I’ll 
be over early tomorrow morning.” 

115 




I don’t believe any men have 
ever been so happy to see Carter as 
we were. 

“They’ll balance,” he said. 
“Starvation will do its work. I’ve 
brought along a couple of pairs of 
bam owls. They’ll help a lot. I see 
you read that ecology book. Good 
job. Station virtually wiped out. 
I’m sending supplies over in a 
week’s time. Anybody wants to 
know, you’re supposed to be help- 
ing extend and restore the tem and 
gull colonies. Wouldn’t be a bad 
idea to try a few other animal ex- 
periments. Milder, though. Smaller 
scale. Send canvas for a sail too.” 

He was gone before we could 
answer. The small freighter put in 
July fifteenth. She had no cargo 
of processed birds to take back, of 
course. The captain detailed a few 
men to unload our supplies, and 
we helped them eagerly. There were 
six calves and heifers, two cows and 
a bull, five pigs, one boar and two 
sows, several dozen hens and a 
rooster. Best of all, there was a 
big case containing seeds : com, 
barley, oats, seed potatoes, melons, 
beets, kale, dozens of others. A plow 
and two draught horses, mare and 
stallion. Several pounds of rat poi- 
son. A hand forge and several tons 
of coke. Iron. A hundred pounds of 
linen twine for nets, as well as ropes 
of all sizes. Canvas. Tools of all 
kinds. A big medical kit. 



I N A YEAR’S time, we had pros- 
pered. No richer land, due to the 
bird droppings, was ever farmed. 
And the sandier areas could be de- 
pended upon for melons and other 

116 



crops demanding a lighter, drier, 
and not so rich soil. Not only that, 
but we were five, now, instead of 
three. The Jackson boys had lured 
a couple of husky girls to the island 
in the boat. The boys claimed the 
women fell in love with them. I 
think they fell in love with the is- 
land. 

This fast work on the part of the 
Jacksons seemed a little rash to me. 
I was still not at all sure we’d be 
allowed to remain and enjoy the 
work we had done. Several times, 
I was tempted to use the radio 
again, but decided to wait. I’m glad 
now I did. 

In August, a little more than a 
year after his last visit. Carter set 
his helicopter down at the wharf 
again. 

After lunch in the barracks of 
baked fish, fresh milk, potatoes, 
salad, and melons, he pushed back 
his chair and said, “I suppose 
you’ve been wondering.” 

“We’d like to know,” I said. 

He nodded. “The mainland’s go- 
ing to pieces. So is the whole world. 
It isn’t just food. We can still pro- 
duce that. Remember what you 
said about the bad roads, bad tele- 
phones? You put your finger on it. 
So much manpower, machinery, 
energy, material is used up in get- 
ting food and processing it and dis- 
tributing it, there isn’t enough for 
other things. A tenth of the world’s 
population and a quarter of its total 
power resources go into processing 
plankton alone. We are literally eat- 
ing ourselves to death. Utilities and 
services are breaking down rapidly. 
No new dwellings of any kind have 

VARLEY LANG 




been built for ten yeairs or more. 
Oil is short, cement, iron, steel, 
coal, plastics, wiring, radios, tele- 
phones, everything is in short sup- 
ply and getting shorter. Transport 
is staggering to a halt.” 

He paused, took off his glasses, 
and twirled them by one side piece. 

“Many of us saw it coming. A 
few decided to do something. We 
thought there should be undis- 
turbed nuclei, a few able people 
with ample food supplies. You are 
one such center. There are others 
at various bird stations along the 
coast. You’ll be joined shortly by 
a few more people, young men and 
women, among them a trained 
nurse, a doctor, a skilled carpenter, 
so on.” 

Bill cleared his throat. 

“What you said, I guess it was 
all around me, only I never seen it, 
not to put together. Just one thing. 
The manager at the Food Plant, he 
used to stop and kid me about all 
the fish I’d stole from the govern- 
ment in my time. He was abraggin’ 
about how WFI had newer and 
better ways of gettin’ things done, 
always newer and better every year. 
How come they couldn’t keep 
caught up?” 

“Bill, those new techniques that 
manager talked about were old 
stuff a hundred, two hundred years 
ago. The applications are new, some 
of them, but the basic ideas are old. 

“The World Food Institute drew 
off all the scientific, inventive brains 
of the world, and put them to chas- 
ing food. No time for basic research, 
basic development; just time for 
tinkering and retinkering old ideas. 

ecology on ROLLINS ISLAND 



Been no new basic idea for a couple 
of centuries. Too much need for 
immediate, practical results. The 
well is dry, and it won’t be filled 
again with a reservoir of new, big 
ideas, not in our time. Been living 
off the past; and the present has 
caught up with us.” 

Before Carter left the island to 
visit the other stations, I had a 
chance to have a talk with him. 

“Was that sociologist, Ranson, 
in on this?” 

“No. We had to be careful. Still 
have to be. Just a few of us. That’s 
why the loss of the bird colonies 
here had to seem natural, or at 
least a natural accident. And I had 
to keep clear of it. You can see 
that.” 

“Garter, what happens on the 
mainland when things break up?” 

“Won’t be pretty. Bad. Very 
bad.” 

“For example?” 

“You read the ecology book. 
What happens when a species 
multiplies beyond its ability to feed 
itself?” 

A dozen new Rollins Islanders 
showed up a few at a time in Car- 
ter’s helicopter. We’ve been work- 
ing and waiting a long time now, 
waiting for Garter to come back. 
For over a year now, our boat hzis 
made no crossing to the mainland. 
Last night, over twenty-five miles of 
sea in clear weather, we saw the 
sky lit by a great fire. 

I haven’t forgotten those rats. I 
dream about them, tearing one an- 
other with bloody fangs. • • •

SCIEiilCE 



BRIEFS 



Defense Department officials pre- 
dict an intercontinental guided 
missile, carrying an atomic war- 
head, that can flash across 5,000 
miles at speeds up to 9,000 miles an 
hour. The weapon would be able 
to hit a target area with a radius 
of about ten miles, be ten times as 
accurate as a German V-2, have 
twenty-five times the range. Plans 
call for at least two varieties of this 
intercontinental missile: 1. A bal- 
listic type that streaks out of the 
atmosphere like an artillery shell at 
more than 12,000 feet a second. 
2 . A jet-propelled type that flies 
more slowly, but can be more ac- 
curately controlled all the way to 
the target and will be able to steer 
itself by the stars. 

Pointless, balMess writing pens are 
predicted by researchers working 
on new writing devices. The one 
now under development has a cone- 
like tip made of sintered metal — 
powdered metal partly welded to- 
gether. Tiny capillary holes in the 
tip permit a thick ink to filter 
through and rub off on the writing 
surface. The pen will not leak 
when not in use, nor does it need 
to be ^aken or rolled over paper 
to get it started after disuse. A 



special feeding system permits all 
ink to be consumed before another 
cartridge is needed. 

The largest saucer-like radio tele- 
scope in the United States will 
soon be under construction at Har- 
vard University’s Agassiz Station 
Observatory. The great “dish”, 
a steerable parabolic antenna sixty 
feet in diameter, will be used to 
study and record radio radiation 
being received on Earth from outer 
space. Plans also include a large 
radio astronomy observatory from 
which radio waves could be 
bounced off Mars and other planets 
as well as the sun. 

Patients who need a blood-vessel 
transplant will grow and store their 
own when animal experiments now 
in progress are eventually applied 
to humans. Since the body tends to 
resist foreign tissue, person to person 
grafts in case of a damaged aorta 
are often untenable. The latest 
solution is to cut a vein to the size 
needed in the patient’s own body 
and fit it over a plastic rod. It is 
then wrapped in muscle tissue and 
buried in the thigh muscle where 
it is nourished for two or three 
weeks until a firm tube is formed. 
When the v^sel is needed for graft-^ 
ing, the thigh is reopened, the 
plastic rod removed, and the fresh- 
ly elastic vein hooked into the aorta 
to replace the defective segment. 

Future Motorists will drive on high- 
ways that will help steer the cars 
and on which the dips and curves 
cannot be felt. Highway engineers 
predict that “pavement geometry” 




can be used to bank curves so that 
a blindfolded person riding beside 
the driver would never know of the 
change of direction after going 
around such a curve. During mo- 
mentary lapses on the part of a 
motorist, such a highway would be 
able to “steer” the car until the 
driver could regain control. 

Our grandchildren's children will 
have enough raw materials and 
energy resources despite gloomy 
predictions to the contrary. Recent 
scientific reports indicate that new 
methods of utilization of minerals, 
a curbing of waste, discoveries of 
new deposits and the substitution of 
common rock and ceramics are 
enough to quench any long range 
predictions of a raw material short- 
age. The harnessing of solar energy 
through new discoveries in photo- 
synthesis, atomic reactors and the 
direct generation of electricity in 
transistor types of photovoltaic cells 
also promise a supply of energy far 
in excess of the demand even if 
coal, gas and petroleum, to which 
our civilization is now geared, 
should be exhausted. 

Science and industry have caught 
up with fictioneers again. The latest 
thing in bedding is a gyrating mat- 
tress, set into motion by a small 
motor in the foot of the bed. De- 
signed to overcome insomnia by 
lulling the bed’s occupant to sleep, 
the “rock-a-by-bed” is the actual 
development of an idea that science 
fiction writers have been using as 
standard equipment in their “homes 



of the future” for many years. 

A new profession — that of crimi- 
nalist — may be what all little boys 
will aspire to be before many more 
years roll by. Such a criminalist 
will be a specialist, but not in any 
one field. He will have to qualify 
as an expert in identity, evidence 
of different kinds, from blood 
groups to ink — from textiles to 
metals — from vegetation to soil. In 
addition he will be well versed in 
the understanding of the practical 
side of crime investigation and legal 
requirements of courts and evi- 
dence. Like a physician, a crimi- 
nalist will begin training with a 
broad knowledge of science, on this 
he must build a study of micro- 
scopy, microchemistry, law and any 
other off-branches concerned. 
Training will require a minimum 
of five years of college study which 
closely parallels that of pre-medical 
students. 

Blind persons someday may be able 
to walk with certainty through un- 
familiar territory without the aid 
of seeing eye dogs or canes. Scien- 
tists and researchers have revealed 
a new electron device to warn 
blind users of obstacles and poten- 
tial hazards, such as curbs and 
lampposts. Carried like a lunch pail, 
the device shoots out a beam of light 
that is reflected by such obstacles. 
The reflected light is then picked 
up by a built-in optical reception 
system and a vibrator in the handle 
translates the reflections into warn- 
ings or reassurances for the user.

THE PATRIOT (Continued from page 205) 



prohibited on Earth for a decade 
— yet they listened. The censors, 
shocked, galvanized, started to act, 
to cut off the broadcast — and could 
not. The powerful music had crept 
insidiously into their minds, and 
their fingers were paralyzed above 
the keys while The Martianne 
flamed triumphant through the air 
of Earth. 

When the final note had died 
away, Gomel stood up at his piano 
and said into the microphones: 

“That is the music of Mars. Re- 
member it, people of Earth.” 

It was a brief trial. Gomel was 
admittedly guilty of violating the 
law against inciting the public to 
military action, but because of 
Meta’s influence and the temper 
of the people, he was not sentenced 
to prison. He was deported to 
Mars, freed to return to his own 
people. 

Spurred by the Mars Gorpora- 
tion, the Earth government acted 
quickly. The Martianne was the 
most dangerous of any music the 
psychosociologists had banned. Its 
performance was prohibited on 
pain of death, possession of a tape 
of it was punishable by fine and im- 
prisonment. 

But too many tapes had been 



home-recorded on the night of 
Gomel’s last concert. Too many 
people remembered the basic 
strains, the theme of The Mar^ 
tianne. Laws could not confine it. 
It was hummed, at first secretly, 
then openly and defiantly. 

And too many people had hung 
on every televised instant of Gor- 
nel’s trial and had heard him say, 
simply and earnestly, why he had 
violated the laws designed to pro- 
tect the peace of Earth, why he had 
willingly endangered his life. 

“It is right that men should have 
peace,” said Gomel on the witness 
stand, “but first, it is right that 
they should have freedom.” 

At first secretly, then openly and 
defiantly, the Friends of Mars grew 
into an organization that poured 
the contributions of the people of 
Earth into ships and guns for the 
free people of Mars. 

Every Martian year they play it 
formally now, on the anniversary 
of the signing of the Mars Gharter. 
In solemn ceremonies, the military 
band of Mars plays The Martianne 
before the imposing edifice erected 
at Gharax by Meta Erosine in 
memory of Gomel Lorensse, the 
patriot who died in action during 
the final seige of Mars Gity. • • •
