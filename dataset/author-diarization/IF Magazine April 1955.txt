On a Pair of Crooked Dice! 

SHILL 

By JAMES E. GUNN 




AIRPORT OF THE FUTURE — Tomorrow's port for intercontinental jet ships 
and interplanetary space ships will be located as closely as possible to the big 
cities, connected by rapid electronic highways and controlled helicopter 
lanes. The port building will resemble a huge top and will be equipped with 
a long ramp which swivels around the circular base. Passengers and luggage 
can be speedily transferred to ships by means of fast-moving conveyors 
which run from the immigration offices direct to the ship.

A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 



HUMAN NATURE being what it is, 
it isn’t too strange that man can 
just about outgripe anything on 
legs. But a little griping now and 
then is all right, might even be good 
for you, and there are times when 
you have to come right out with a 
big one. But what gets me is the 
person who is forever griping about 
something or lamenting his plight. 
It can be his business or his auto or 
his liver; he’s the unluckiest guy in 
the world; he’s got worries like no- 
body else ever had. 

I’ve done my share and maybe 
more, but every time I start feeling 
sorry for myself I try to think about 
stories I’ve read or some things I’ve 
seen. Like the two or three times 
I’ve read Candide, for instance. To 
my mind Voltaire wrote, in Can- 
dide, one of the most beautiful sa- 
tires of all time. And when Dr. 
Pangloss said to Candide, who was 
having one of his lower moods, 
“Everything happens for the best”, 
I also picked up a piece of personal 



philosophy that’s been very helpful. 
Another scene I liked was when 
Candide entered the tavern think- 
ing himself the most unfortunate 
man in the whole wide world. His 
lord’s castle had just been pillaged 
and burned, the family drawn and 
quartered, all females raped and 
disemboweled, and he had lost his 
beloved Cunnegunde. Woe was he 
as he sat down at the tavern table. 
Yet, when each man spoke of his 
misfortunes, Candide found that he 
wasn’t the most unfortunate man 
in the world after all. For each of 
the other travellers had experi- 
enced misfortunes worse than his 
own. 

The point I’m trying to make is 
that we often aren’t as unlucky as 
we believe. And I think we have all 
had personal experiences which, by 
comparison, make us pretty well off. 
Anyhow, here’s one I had . 

IT HAPPENED one day about two 
years ago when I was in a mean 
stew about business. My imagina- 
tion was playing havoc with my 
reasoning and I wasn’t eating and 
wasn’t speaking civilly to anyone. 
Just what the problem was, I don’t 
remember now. But I was the 
gloomiest gus you ever saw and was 
damning my luck all over the place 
and feeling extremely sorry for my- 
self. I had to go down to New York 
to take care of the problem and 
dreaded the trip. Anyhow, I got on 
a bus and was on my way. 

It was a lovely day, during Oc- 
tober, I think, and the sky was a 
sharp sunny blue and the moun- 
tains and woods were a riot of col- 
ors and the air had a wonderful 
bite that was sort of intoxicating. 
That is, if you noticed it. I didn’t. 



2 



I was too emerged in my own prob- 
lems. 

Anyhow, we were somewhere be- 
tween New Paltz and Wallkill, 
which was about 25 miles of riding, 
when the bus stopped at a little 
country station — one of those non- 
scheduled places which resembles a 
deserted fruit stand. I saw vaguely 
that there were two people waiting, 
a man and an old woman. The bus 
was on its way again when the man 
sat down beside me. I wouldn’t 
even have noticed him had he not 
lunged against me as he sat down. I 
was on the point of asking him if 
he was drunk or just plain rude, 
but something held my tongue as I 
got my first look at him. 

He was a youth, about twenty, 
and shabbily dressed. He had a 
strange short-cropped haircut and 
a pasty white complexion and a 
looseness about his face and body 
that seemed out of place. I saw that 
the elderly woman had sat just 
across the aisle. She was very gray, 
and poorly dressed, too, but there 
was something about her lined face 
that shone and her smile was one of 
patience and kindness. 

I must have been wishing that 
the person who had sat next to me 
had sat somewhere else and it prob- 
ably showed in my face, for the old 
lady looked at me and said, “He’s 
all right.” She gave me a look that 
hoped I would understand. Then 
she reached over and patted him 
on the arm and said, “Now you be 
good and be quiet.” 

I glanced quickly back to the 
youth and a chill went through me 
as I realized that the person next 
to me was the first idiot I had ever 
seen. Suddenly I wanted to get off 
the bus. I edged closer to the win- 



dow and tried to bury my face in a 
copy of the New York Times . Then 
it occurred to me that my attitude 
was blatantly obvious and I was 
hurting the feelings of the old lady, 
who appeared to be his mother or 
grandmother or an aunt. Or maybe 
she was used to people acting the 
way I was, for she gave me that 
same hopeful look again. I put the 
paper down. “Would you like to 
exchange seats and sit over here 
with him?” I asked. 

The old lady smiled and shook 
her head. “I hope you don’t mind,” 
she explained, “but he sees nobody 
but me all the time and he’d like to 
sit next to you for awhile. Is it all 
right?” 

I guess I must have nodded 
rather stupidly and muttered “sure” 
or “gladly” or something. What 
does one actually say at times like 
this? 

A little while later she reached 
into one of the bags she was hold- 
ing in her lap and got an apple and 
gave it to him. He took it with 
wobbling hands and then rubbed it 
on his frayed coat and looked at it 
and made an inarticulate sound 
that went with his bobbing head 
and watery blank eyes. He seemed 
very happy about the way he had 
shined it. Abruptly he thrust it at 
me. He said something that sound- 
ed like “bite” and I didn’t know 
what to say or do. 

My smile must have been rather 
tight as I said, “Thank you — I — ” 

The old lady came to my rescue. 
“That young man doesn’t want to 
take your apple,” she told him. 
“Now you be good. You eat it.” 

That seemed to satisfy him. 

During the next twenty or thirty

T he Galactical Examiner condemned Earth to 
isolation because one man had cheated with 
the dice. But Fader Martin had good cause 
to cheat. The universe was at stake . 



SHILL 



TTE WAS a middling tall, aging man with a waist 
that had begun to spread and a rough-hewn phi- 
losopher’s face bleached by ten-thousand sunless days. 
His name was Fader Martin. 

People called him the Banker, but there was a better 
name for him. Shill. 

He had a voice inside his head. 

He stood by the elevator door in the decaying, mid- 
Twentieth Century grandeur of the Desert Inn corridor 
and waited for the spinning silver dollar to come down. 
As it fell, Fader caught it deftly out of the air and 
slapped it over on his wrist. 

“It comes up heads,” he said. He unveiled the cart- 
wheel. “Tails,” he muttered. Then a frown creased his 
forehead.

Who’s meddling? 

“Fader said the voice inside his head, “the plan’s 
hopeless. Who can win with an exposed hand?” 

Too late. Even if it weren’t , we’ve been over and over 
the thing often enough to know that nothing else has a 
prayer. We have to lay our cards on the table. We can’t 
keep him from spotting the one-eyed jack , but we can 
keep shuffling them around so that he has to guess 
where it is. 

“French monte?” 

Shell game. Watch the pea , ladies and gentlemen! 
It’s never out of sight. Which shell is it under? Guess 
the right shell and win the grand prize! The one in the 
middle? Tm sorry, sir — Fader took a deep, harsh 
breath. Only it makes these old hands shake sometimes 



5 





when they remember that the grand 
prize is the universe. 

The elevator doors split apart 
and asked him in. 

“Good morning, Mr. Martin,” 
said the eager young man with the 
glad smile. “How’s the Banker this 
morning?” 

“Let me put it this way,” Fader 
said tiredly, “if I could burn the 
dice now and start out with a fresh 
roll, there’ d be some hot dice right 
quick.” 

“Hope there’s nothing wrong, 
Mr. Martin,” the boy said with 
quick concern. “I got a sawbuck 
riding on your nose.” 

Fader’s smile was a little grim. 
“Nothing that a little rest wouldn’t 
cure. Fader’s getting old and tired, 
boy. He can’t stay on top forever.” 

“Oh, I’ve got a system — ” the 
boy began confidently. 

Fader held up a pale, thick-fin- 
gered hand. “Don’t tell me. You 
double up on favorites.” 

“How’d you know?” the boy 
asked, wide-eyed. 

“In my lifetime,” Fader said, 
leaning back against the rear wall 
of the car, “I’ve seen every system 
ever invented. They all have two 
things in common: 1) they re- 

quire a large starting capital, and 
2) they always go broke. If you 
lose, you double your bet on the 
next favorite until you finally get 
a winner, right?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“At Gulfstream Park, Florida, a 
little over a hundred years ago, 
twenty-one favorites lost in a row. 
If you had bet two bucks on the 
first race and doubled your bet for 
each one thereafter, your bet on 
the twenty-first race would have 
been $16,016,896. Just to win a 



two-dollar bet.” 

“But if a man can’t play a sys- 
tem,” the boy objected, “how is he 
going to win?” 

“Is he to win at all?” Fader said 
slowly. “That is the question.” 

The boy sighed and punched 
the button. “Take a chance on a 
turkey, sir?” 

Fader looked down at the punch- 
board held close to his nose. 
“Thanksgiving must be six months 
away,” he said wrily. 

“Can’t start too early.” 

The boy was an atavism. In a 
world of salesmen he would have 
been wealthy and successful, re- 
spected and powerful. Here his 
talents were useless, his existence 
marginal; he could only peer in at 
the people around whom this world 
revolved. 

But punchboards and turkeys are 
an elevator boy’s perennial pre- 
rogative. “Sure,” Fader said. He 
punched out a cylinder of paper 
and reached for his pocket. 

“Just ten cents, sir. This is your 
lucky day.” 

The doors parted. In front of 
them was the wide, cool, deserted 
lobby. 

Fader smiled ruefully. “I hope 
so.” He flipped a dime at the boy 
and started out of the car. 

“Gould you give me a tip, sir?” 
the boy asked brightly. 

Fader swung around. “You’ve 
got the dime,” he said impatiently. 
“Flip it!” 

With puzzled eyes, the boy spun 
the coin high in the air. 

“Gall it!” Fader ordered. 

“Heads,” said the boy. He 
caught the coin and turned it over 
on his wrist. “It’s tails,” he said, 
looking down.

“That’s your answer. Here’s your 
tip — don’t gamble! Anyone with no 
more psi than you hasn’t got a 
chance.” 

“I know I could be a winner, 
Mr. Martin,” the boy pleaded. “All 
I need is a little capital. You can’t 
get that at a few bucks a day. If 
you’d just give me one — ” 

Fader sighed. “Earthbound in 
the fifth,” he said. 

“Yes, sir!” the boy exclaimed. 
In his eyes was a reflection of the 
gamblers’ grail — the sure thing. 

Fader turned away, a little sad. 
It was a good world, this red-and- 
black jungle, but there are misfits 
in even the best of worlds. 

Even Heaven had Lucifer. 



T HE LOBBY was clean, pol- 
ished, and wide. Desks and 
shops were exposed and unroman- 
tic by morning sunlight. Only 
the tobacco-and-newscounter was 
staffed. 

The girl behind the counter was 
bright-eyed, brown-haired, and 
well-scrubbed. The cleanness of her 
beauty brought a smile to Fader’s 
lips. “Just the Racing Form , Jan.” 
He tossed thirty-five cents into the 
felt-lined box in front of her. “You 
don’t look like a player. How come 
you’re working?” 

“I used to be. Pretty good, too. 
But now I’ve got a young man — ” 
“Syndicate?” Fader asked. 

Color rose into her cheeks like a 
gay flag. “More like a partner. He’s 
asked me to marry him.” 

“A proper tribute,” Fader com- 
mented. The forms changed but 
people remained the same. Women 
had always worked to give their 
men a start. They always would. 

SHILL 



“And how’s he doing?” 

“Even better than we’d hoped.” 

“No doubt I’ll have to reckon 
with him some time — if I last that 
long.” 

She shook her head with finality. 
“Not with him, Fader. When he 
wins fifty million, we’ll quit. That’s 
all decided.” 

“Then I can wish him luck with- 
out reservation,” Fader said, smil- 
ing. But as he turned away with 
the thick tabloid folded in his 
hand, he was thinking, If the boy's 
good , he'll never quit. The game 
gets in a man's blood . 1 wouldn't 
want it any other way. 

Jan was talking to him, he real- 
ized suddenly. He had fallen into 
a habit lately of these internal dia- 
logues. Maybe it was because of 
this voice in his head. More likely 
it was age. He was getting old, he 
told himself ruefully. He had been 
on top too long; it was time he re- 
tired. 

He wouldn’t, though. Not while 
he had a chip left. And not while 
he had a stake left in this other 
game — the blue-chip game. 

“Roll for it, Fader?” the girl re- 
peated. “Double or nothing?” She 
shook the imitation-leather cup. It 
clicked enticingly. 

Politely but firmly, Fader re- 
fused. “I’ll need all my luck before 
the day is over.” 

“Cowboy?” she asked anxiously. 

“Don’t you read your own pa- 
pers?” he asked, lifting a thick, 
dark eyebrow. “There’s always an- 
other one. But this is different. The 
Examiner’s here — ” 

Her eyes opened like fringed 
gentians before the sun. “I didn’t 
know. Last time was fifty years ago, 
wasn’t it?”

“To the day,” Fader agreed. 
“Very punctual people.” 

“He’s come to see if we can 
pass?” 

“That, I gather, is the general 
idea.” 

The girl frowned and caught her 
red, full lower lip between her 
teeth. In the cup sitting on the 
green, the dice chattered. 

“What’s the matter?” Fader 
asked. 

“I don’t know.” She shrugged 
the mood away. “It’s just — Oh — 
the best of luck. With both your 
problems. We like our Banker, you 
see. We don’t want to have to break 
in another one. And we’d like to 
pass the examination if — if — ” 

Fader nodded. “If it doesn’t in- 
volve any effort. Thanks for the 
good wishes. I’ll need all the luck 
I can get.” 

He walked through the broad 
archway into the casino. He 
couldn’t avoid it if he wanted to. 
Traffic to and from rooms, restau- 
rants, bars, shops, swimming pools, 
sun decks, golf links was routed 
past banks of slot machines and 
clusters of gaming tables. Facilities 
for trying a man’s luck were always 
close at hand. 

The slot machines were in banks. 
Die-hards stood before them in 
tireless, trancelike concentration 
looking even more mechanical than 
the machines they fed so rhythmi- 
cally. 

Fader looked down at his hand. 
A silver dollar was in the palm. He 
shrugged: such was the force of 
habit. It slipped into a waiting coin 
slot with an ease that was almost 
alive. Fader heard it hit bottom and 
pulled the handle as he passed. 

The bandit was old-fashioned. 

8 



Most of them were. They did not 
differ materially from those in 
which his great-grandmother had 
squandered the week’s grocery 
money. Gamblers are notoriously 
conservative; they want slot ma- 
chines to look like coin traps in- 
stead of automatic venders. 

Chung-chung-chung! Bar! Bar! 
Bar! Cartwheels cascaded into the 
pay-off cup. Eighty of them made 
quite a din. 

“Another jackpot!” An apron 
girl hurried up to him smiling hap- 
pily. 

“Put the cartwheels in a sack, 
eh? I’ll take them with me.” 

The sack was heavy, but Fader 
carried it to the door. The inevi- 
table beggar was sitting there. This 
one was legless. He blinked blindly 
into the sunshine, his battered hat 
upside down between his legs to re- 
ceive donations. 

He was there from choice, not 
necessity. In a completely straight- 
forward sense, he was an employee 
of the house — a convenience pro- 
vided for the patrons — and he 
worked his shift exactly like the 
croupiers and the apron girls. 

Fader had been lucky. He 
wanted to stay lucky. Gently he 
slipped the sack of coins into the 
hat. The old man turned his face 
up. “May the gods of chance smile 
on you,” he whispered. The money 
would quickly disappear into the 
bandit thoughtfully installed at the 
beggar’s side. It didn’t matter. 

Fader had bought back his luck. 

Fader took three steps into the 
sunshine before he realized that the 
beggar was one of those ancient 
daredevils who had risked their 
lives in a no-limit game. 

JAMES E. GUNN 




What they had done, no one 
could ever forget. After them, there 
was no more need to buck the 
game. 

He was, perhaps, one of the 
lucky ones. He had come flaming 
down from that wall in the sky, but 
he had escaped alive. Destiny had 
claimed only his legs and his eyes. 

Fader remembered a tape he 
had heard once. He had listened to 
it with his hands sweaty and his 
body taut, as if he could help the 
ship through the invisible wall by 
an effort of will. That was foolish. 
The tape was more than fifty years 
old: 

“Twenty-four thousand miles, 5 * 
the voice had said. It had been flat 
and unemotional. “No trouble yet. 
Power still on. Still accelerating. 
Going to cut off soon and coast. 
Kennedy thinks it may make a dif- 
ference. We’ll see. Out now.” 

But the tape went on, and the 
noises went on in the cramped 
third stage of the rocket. Behind 
everything was the rocket-thunder. 
Closer was breathing, heavy in the 
pickup. A switch clicked. The 
thunder cut off. It was gone. In its 
absence the other noises were much 
too loud. 

“Power off, now,” said the name- 
less man. “Will try to coast 
through. Twenty-four thousand 
nine hundred. Should be soon 
now.” His voice climbed a little, 
betrayed emotion for the first time. 
“Feel weightless, but I don’t mind 
that. Nine hundred fifty. Sixty. 
Hope you’re right, Kennedy. 
Ninety. Here we go. Hold your 
hats, boys — ” 

Tense, then distorted with sur- 
prise and fear: “Skin temp climb- 
ing. Melting! Instruments. Dash- 

SHILL 



board. All at once. No dice, boys. 
Going to try to jettison before it 
gets to me. Hope the cartridge 
works. Hope — ” 

After that there was nothing but 
background crackling on the tape 
and then nothing at all. 

Fader sat on the bench looking 
out over the irrigated velvety 
greenness of the fairways. They 
look like a vast crap table, he 
thought. His gaze climbed above 
the horizon toward the sky. Its 
blueness was bright and unclouded 
and pure. No one would suspect 
that it was a wall, just as definite 
as brick and millions of times 
stronger. 

Within its limits Earth was con- 
tained, complete in itself, and with 
it the race that had mastered it 
and sought to use it as a stepping 
stone to the stars. The long climb 
upward from the puddles and pools 
and seas was done. The Big Pit 
Boss had burned the dice as they 
passed the box. “The sky’s the 
limit,” he’d said. It was. Literally. 

Fader imagined ghostly cubes 
tumbling over the vast felt-lined 
table of Earth. Humanity had 
crapped out. 

The eternal frontier had been an 
illusion. On the day, 100 years ago, 
man discovered he was no longer 
alone, he learned that he was iso- 
lated. Man, the Gambler, had 
found the Big Game in town, and 
the policeman had told him to play 
solitaire in his own room. 

It was more than any gambler 
could endure. 

Man had been ready for mil- 
lenia. Let the aliens come — he was 
psychologically prepared for the 
meeting. 

The most primitive tribe would 

9 




have received them as gods. The 
most sophisticated civilizations 
would have accepted them as fel- 
low beings. 

If life on Earth were not an 
anomaly, then it existed through- 
out the universe. Even if habitable 
planets were as scarce as one to 
every 200,000 suns, there would 
still be millions of them. That is 
stellar mathematics. 

Somewhere among them, then, 
should be at least one race tech- 
nologically more advanced than 
man, and it would be long odds 
indeed if there weren’t many. 

So went the reasoning, when rea- 
son was in fashion. 

In all the ages man had been 
ready. But he had not been ready 
for this. He had not been ready 
for the impossibly small ship that 
appeared suddenly above White 
Sands. He had not been ready for 
the emergence of a single manlike 
being or for his words, in impec- 
cable English, “Earth is quaran- 
tined. Man cannot be accepted 
into the interstellar society of races 
until he meets certain standards of 
public and private behavior. Until 
then a wall will stand between Man 
and outer space. Do not attempt 
to break through — it is deadly. Ac- 
cept your lot. Perfect yourself.” 

It was surprising but not unrea- 
sonable. If it was anything, it was 
much too reasonable. 

The philosophy of Western Ci- 
vilization contained a vital pre- 
mise: Man and his society were 
not perfect. Granted the premises 
of the alien — 1) the existence of a 
Galactic Union (evidence: the 

alien himself), and 2) the ability 
to carry out his statements (evi- 
dence: the ship) — then there was 

10 



only one thing to do: perfect Man 
and his society. 

But what is obvious is not always 
possible. 

In one hand the alien held 
threats. The other held gifts. 

He offered assistance in helping 
humanity meet minimum Galactic 
standards. When that was refused 
— for humanity does not take kind- 
ly to tutors — he offered a con- 
venient, fantastically efficient con- 
verter for solar energy and an en- 
ergy storage device which escaped 
the fantastic only by comparison. 

Humanity accepted. There is 
such a thing as false pride. 

The alien left as he had come. 
He would return, he said, for 
periodic examinations of human- 
ity’s progress. 

Humanity frowned into the sky 
and disbelieved — in spite of tapes, 
films, the alien artifacts, the con- 
verter and the battery. Man be- 
sieged the heavens with missiles, 
manned and unmanned. 

And he saw them fall, flaming 
like Lucifer into Hell. 

The wall was impassable and un- 
breakable. 

Man had met the alien, and the 
quality in which he had so prided 
himself — the reasoning mind which 
could comprehend and conquer the 
universe — had been brought to per- 
fection by this race long ago. Man 
could never hope to catch up. 

A place becomes a prison when 
leaving it is forbidden. Earth was 
now a prison, and it was suddenly 
too small for Man. And the only 
route to a shorter sentence was good 
behavior. 

But perfect himself? Man wasn’t 
built like that. 

He was competitive, and he had 
JAMES E. GUNN 




suddenly been denied the right to 
compete. The old competitions 
were pointless now, and it was ob- 
vious that the real fight was fixed. 
It was no surprise that Man had 
turned to his old mock struggles — 
the games of chance — and made 
all Earth a vast casino. 

In one sense it was a safety valve. 
The Examiner might understand. 
Whether he would sympathize and 
approve was another matter. 



I N the back pages of the Rac- 
ing Form was a large ad printed 
like a news item. It announced, 
proudly: 

COWBOY BREAKS BANK 
AT GOLDEN NUGGET 

Fader glanced down the column. 
John Head, better known as Pray- 
ing John, had taken the Golden 
Nugget for more than 16 million 
dollars last night, causing a tem- 
porary suspension of play while the 
pit boss secured more funds. Head 
had placed a ten-dollar chip on 
Number 13 and let it ride. The 
number 13 had received the little 
ball five times in a row. 

The ad, of course, had been paid 
for by the Golden Nugget. Praying 
John’s success was a fabulous stroke 
of luck for the casino, and they 
would be derelict if they did not 
publicize it to the hilt. 

The Nugget’s wheel, obviously, 
was the most generous in Las 
Vegas and, therefore, in the world. 
Its patrons were the luckiest. Be- 
fore those implications were forgot- 
ten, the casino would win back 
many times its original loss. 

Praying John was the best shill 
the Nugget ever had.

He was also the most dangerous 
highroller current. 

The back pages of the Racing 
Form contained a few news items 
of a general nature. As the world’s 
most widely circulated newspaper 
(Editions in Europe , Asia, Africa, 
South America, and Australia) the 
Daily Racing Form considered the 
coverage of non-sporting news a 
public duty. 

Fader was interested in only one 
short item. Under a Las Vegas 
dateline was the following informa- 
tion: 

Registering at the El Cortez 
Hotel in downtown Las Vegas 
this afternoon was a manlike 
creature who signed the register 
in meaningless hieroglyphics . 
Under questioning by the clerk, 
he asserted that he was the Ex- 
aminer from the Galactic Union. 

The government, the creature 
is reported to have said, was al- 
ready aware of his presence . No 
official could be reached to con- 
firm this. 

It has been learned, however, 
that the White Sands spaceport 
ruins have been closed to the 
public, and a hurry-up call sum- 
moned government stickmen to 
turn back would-be-kibitzers. 

Fader smiled. If the inquiring 
reporter had seen the impossibly 
tiny ship among the rusty towers of 
the abandoned multiple-stage rock- 
ets, he would have been even more 
puzzled. Technicians requisitioned 
from a nearby pinball factory had 
offered odds that the thing could 
never get off the ground. 

It was a sucker bet, but it ex- 
pressed their feelings perfectly. 

11 




The sound of childish voices 
broke Fader’s reverie. 

“Yeanh! Yeanh!” came the nasal 
chant. “Welsher! Welsher!” 

“We weren’t neither playing for 
keeps,” said a voice full of tears. 
“We weren’t! We weren’t!” 

The circle was inscribed in a 
sandy path that bisected the green- 
ness. The morning sun made jewels 
of the scattered, marbles inside the 
circle, but they were forgotten. The 
boys had formed an ugly half- 
circle, heavy sacks swinging in their 
hands. Its center was a boy whose 
back was toward Fader. 

The boys looked up in surprise 
when Fader said, “Now what’s the 
trouble?” 

“Who wants to know?” snapped 
one of them, tossing back an unruly 
lock of hair. 

Beside him a friend nudged 
vigorously with his elbow and said 
in a stage whisper, “Shut up, 
Stupid! It’s Fader.” 

“You see, sir,” said an earnest 
dark-haired boy, “we got up a lit- 
tle game, sir, and Kenny here 
wanted to play, but when we won 
he wouldn’t pay.” 

Fader turned inquiringly toward 
the golden-haired boy named 
Kenny. His tear-stained face was 
angelic with beauty and trust, but 
he clutched a slim sack of marbles 
tightly to his chest. His voice was a 
clear soprano. “Nobody said we 
were playing for keeps, sir.” 

“Come over here a moment,” 
Fader said gently, his heart leaden, 
and walked slowly to the bench, 
out of hearing of the others. 
“Kenny,” he said, putting one hand 
on the boy’s shoulder as he sat 
down, “there are some things you 

12 



can’t learn too early. One of them 
is that life is for keeps.” 

“But they didn’t tell me, sir — ” 

And he looked not so much like 
a fallen angel, as one who has let 
the shadow of a mortal fall upon 
him. 

“There comes a time — always — 
for everyone,” Fader said slowly, 
“when he discovers the real nature 
of the world. Call it a moment of 
discovery, of illumination, of being 
born into the knowledge of good 
and evil. It is a sword with a dou- 
ble edge. It also teaches a person 
what he himself is like. You know I 
wouldn’t tout you wrong, don’t 
you?” 

“Yes, sir,” the boy said, his eyes 
steady. 

“Afterwards,” Fader went on, 
“the person realizes that the world 
is actually independent of his 
wishes, that it is he who must shape 
himself to fit it, and that his ac- 
ceptance is conditional. But if a 
person wants acceptance, he must 
reshape himself to the world’s 
standards. Right?” 

“Yes, sir,” the boy said. 

“There are two kinds of people 
in the world,” Fader said quietly. 
“There are players and there are 
kibitzers. The players are competi- 
tors. They throw themselves into 
the game, learn the rules, abide by 
them, and try to win — which is to 
get back some part of the omni- 
potence they have lost. The kibit- 
zers are content to stand by and 
watch and never to be a part of the 
game at all. Understand?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“There’re two kinds of people, 
Kenny, and there’s nothing wrong 
with either one of them. But the 
secret of happiness lies in discover- 

JAMES E. GUNN 




ing which kind you are and stick- 
ing to it. If you’re a player, play by 
the rules and play hard, accept 
your winnings, pay your losses, and 
don’t complain. Chance has no fa- 
vorites. If you’re going to kibitz, 
kibitz and savor the pleasures of 
watching. Don’t be half one, half 
the other, and all miserable.” 

“I understand, sir,” Kenny said 
manfully, his chin high, and he 
handed Fader the slim sack of mar- 
bles. “I won’t play any more; 
there’s nothing I want that much.” 
He turned and ran quickly over 
the green turf toward the hotel. 

Fader watched him out of sight, 
a brooding frown darkening his 
face. It was a jungle world, cer- 
tainly, as it had always been, and 
a jungle is no place for angels. 
That was a pity, but there was no 
help for it. 

He swung around to the silent 
group of players and held out the 
sack to the boy with the unruly 
lock of hair. This one Fader could 
understand. Here, at least, was the 
stuff of which players were made. 
Some fifty years ago Fader himself 
might have looked much like that. 

The boy took the sack with a 
quick, grubby hand. 

“You won these at a game of 
skill,” Fader said evenly. “That 
isn’t playing the game. A game of 
skill is only another way of cheat- 
ing. Don’t kid yourselves that you 
were gambling. Gambling is ruled 
by chance.” 

But the winner, as Fader turned 
away, was unrepentant. 

Fader chuckled and shook his 
head as he climbed into the helijet 
summoned by the doorman’s built- 
in radio. “The El Cortez,” he said 
into the whpre-box. 

SHILL 



The rotors lifted him upward 
and then cut out as the rear jets 
kicked the plane toward the city of 
Las Vegas. 

As the city sprawling in the sands 
rushed toward him, Fader had time 
to study its giant, three-sided tote 
board and the names and odds cir- 
cling eternally, light against black- 
ness, for every citizen to see and 
put down his bet. The odds at the 
moment concerned the big, per- 
petual battle for the Bank: 

FADER MARTIN $ 11 , 503 , 762,016 2-1 

monte jones 5 , 222 , 834,125 15-1 

LUCKY KNIGHT 3 , 219 , 107,009 20-1 

John head 1 , 836 , 712,138 9-1 

Although Jones and Knight were 
several lengths in front of Praying 
John, it was obvious to Fader — as 
it was to the general bettor — that 
they had lost their luck and their 
nerve. They hadn’t been a threat 
for days. 

Even as he watched, the totals of 
Jones and Knight dwindled by a 
few thousand dollars and that of 
Head jumped by more than a mil- 
lion. His odds were lowered to 15-2. 

Fader took a deep breath. Damn 
all highrollers at a time like this! 

The helijet zoomed toward the 
landing platform far below on the 
El Cortez roof. Fader booked a 
small bet with himself that the 
rotors would not kick on. 



T HE EXAMINER reminded 
Fader of Kenny, the boy with 
the curly golden hair. Given sur- 
passing intelligence, character in- 
tegration, and the knowledge of 
great power, the boy could become 
a twin to this creature. 

The Examiner was a superior 

13 




being. There was no denying it. 
Recognition was instinctive. 

Fader battled an inferiority com- 
plex that threatened momentarily 
to overwhelm him. 

The Examiner was angelic, as 
Michael was angelic — extraordi- 
narily tall and slim with a beauty 
that was golden and calm. He had 
an aura compounded of purity, in- 
telligence, and power; it was almost 
physical. Fader blinked several 
times before he convinced himself 
that it was an illusion. 

Like Michael, the Examiner 
held the secret of the mighty word 
by which God created Heaven and 
Earth. Like Michael, he stood 
guard with a flaming sword before 
the gates of Paradise from which 
mankind had been thrust and could 
not enter again. 

Beside him Fader felt short, ani- 
mal, vulgar, stupid, like the pri- 
meval monkey chattering .in the 
trees at the straight, silent proto- 
man moving along the jungle trails 
below. 

Although the Examiner was 
dressed much like Fader — colorful, 
synthetic-fibered slacks and shirt, 
cuffed tightly at wrist and ankle, 
the knees padded — he outshone the 
clothes. By contrast, like the spa- 
cious splendor of the suite, they 
seemed poor, tawdry, shabby 
things. 

This was the being who had the 
power to say, “Your time of trial is 
over. The wall is down; the flam- 
ing sword is lowered. You are free 
to come and go as you wish.” 

What the Examiner said was, 
“You represent the government?” 
His voice was deep and melodious. 

Fader shook himself and nodded. 
“I can speak for the House. They 

14 



call me the Banker.” 

“Conditions have changed since 
my last visit.” 

Fader couldn’t decide whether it 
was an idle comment or a statement 
portentious with meaning. “You 
were the one who came last time — 
fifty years ago?” 

“Yes. My race outlives yours 
considerably.” 

“Naturally?” 

“I’m unable to answer the ques- 
tion,” the Examiner said regret- 
fully. “You must recognize that in- 
formation cannot be divulged 
which might aid Earth in evading 
the Union’s ruling. Even such a 
simple statement as you request 
might have unfortunate conse- 
quences. I am here as an Examiner. 
Let it suffice that a portion of my 
lifetime has been devoted to the 
problem that Earth represents.” 

“Our regrets,” Fader said drily. 

“They aren’t necessary. This is a 
service to my society which I — like 
any citizen — am happy to per- 
form.” 

“You wouldn’t give us the secret 
of longevity, then, even if you had 
it?” 

“We have given you all we can. 
Even if we could give it to you — 
and it might solve many of your 
problems — it would be unwise 
while you cannot control your own 
numbers.” 

“We need longevity to find the 
answers to our problems,” Fader 
summed up, “but we must have the 
answers before you will give us 
longevity?” 

“Granted the premises, the con- 
clusion would be correct. But you 
called the government ‘the House’ 
and yourself ‘the Banker.’ Those 
terms were not current when I was 



JAMES E. GUNN 




here last.” 

Fader summarized the long story 
in a few sentences. The gifts of the 
Galactic Union had made this so- 
ciety feasible. 

With an unlimited, convenient 
source of energy, Earth became a 
world in which no one had to work. 
But for the majority of mankind 
there had to be a reason for ex- 
istence. That reason was gambling. 
There was nothing to be won? 
True. It was an artificial competi- 
tion? True. But that was Man’s na- 
ture; he had to compete, somehow, 
someway. And in the final analysis 
it was no more artificial than most 
competitions. 

The society worked ; that was the 
least that could be said for it. Be- 
cause the symbols for which hu- 
manity gambled — the matches, the 
chips, the dollars — were limited, 
men had to work to get them. Thus 
certain essential duties were per- 
formed. 

No one had to gamble, but if he 
chose to he had to work for his 
starting capital. The money with 
which he was paid had no intrinsic 
value; it could buy nothing except 
what people chose to sell for it — 
which is true, of course, of any me- 
dium of exchange. 

What could not be sold were the 
necessities of life. No one would 
buy, for people only buy what they 
do not have. 

As valid reasons for government 
vanished, elective offices dwindled. 
When a few appointive positions 
became necessary — stickmen, who 
collected revenue, and judges — the 
man with the most chips was asked 
to appoint them. He became, in a 
practical sense, the head of the gov- 
ernment, the Banker. The govern- 

SH1LL 



ment became the House because it 
was a partner in every gambling 
enterprise. 

“They call me the Banker,” 
Fader said wryly, “but there’s a bet- 
ter name for me. Shill.” 

“A shill,” Fader explained, “is a 
houseman who poses as a player to 
stimulate the play. In the sense that 
I perform no useful function except 
as a figurehead who induces other 
men to compete by his example, I 
shill for this society. I suppose 
there’s a little bit of shill in every 
public figure. I’m not ashamed of 
it; a good shill is a rare thing.” 

“I should think,” the Examiner 
pointed out, “that it would depend 
on what he shilled for. Our reasons 
for quarantining Earth remain 
valid. You have not evolved a 
sound society. You have not out- 
grown idle competition. The goals 
you seek are still false. You are 
still unfit for the society of civilized 
beings.” 

“I hope that you haven’t pre- 
judged us.” 

“I point out only that we 
found you — technologically preco- 
cious and psychologically retarded 
— about to burst out among us. For 
your own sake, we placed a quar- 
antine so that you might develop 
naturally — ” 

“How can we develop naturally 
when a flaming wall above us pro- 
claims that we are prisoners de- 
pendent for our well-being and 
even for our continued existence 
upon the mercy and good will of 
unseen aliens?” 

“It is a symptom of moral sav- 
agery,” the Examiner said gently, 
“that our intentions and motives 
should be suspect. We have gained 

15 




nothing from this meeting of races; 
we have no hopes of gaining any- 
thing except, perhaps, the possi- 
bility of free association with an- 
other civilized race. Our theoreti- 
cians have said that you are not 
beyond redemption; they said you 
needed time. Your environment 
had developed a deep-grained com- 
petitive spirit which only time and 
an amelioration of conditions might 
hope to change. We gave you 
leisure. 

Fader frowned, wondering, as he 
had wondered before, if the aliens 
were telepathic. 

“A blank wall ” said the voice 
inside his head. “Like trying to 
read the mind of a fish” 

Completely non-telepathic then? 
Or able to blank himself out? 

“Who knows? My guess: even if 
he’s telepathic, he can’t read an 
alien. 1 can’t do anything with 
him.” 

Might as well forget it, then. If 
he can, there’s no help for it — 
we’re up the creek without a 
paddle . 

“I ask you,” Fader said to the 
Examiner, “whether you did not 
give us gifts out of a feeling of 
guilt.” 

The Examiner’s shrug was as 
natural as if he had been shrugging 
all his life. “We are not insulated 
from error or immune to emotion. 
We may have been prompted by 
a small desire to make amends. But 
what did you do with the leisure 
we gave? You set up new goals 
even more ephemeral, sought by 
methods even more disproportion- 
ate. Can you defend such a world, 
so unequal, so pointless?” 

“Ethically, morally, economically 
I can defend it — any way you wish. 

16 



Pointless? You miss the point. Of 
course we have inequality — how 
can any society avoid it? — But 
note that this is not the inequality 
of birth, of intelligence, of skill, or 
of anything else permanent and 
unchanging. This is the fleeting, 
impartial inequality of chance. If it 
raises a man high one day, it may 
drop him below the lowest tomor- 
row. And those who are broke this 
week may rule next week. Every- 
one is equal in the eyes of chance.” 

“The equality is spurious which 
takes no account of merit.” 

“Merit?” Fader asked in sur- 
prise. “What intrinsic merit do we 
claim? We are born, unwilling into 
this world; we exist in it only be- 
cause it seems the lesser of evils. We 
have no right, sir, in ourselves, to 
claim anything of destiny except 
the impartial distribution of her 
temporary favors. Our only proper 
demand is that the game be 
honest.” 

“Every society has a duty,” the 
Examiner said soberly. “That duty 
is to reward and so promote the 
best conduct — that conduct which 
is best for the race, for the society, 
and for the individual — in that 
order. The great flaw in your race 
and your society was that it in- 
verted this normal order. I have 
seen no evidence of change.” 

“Who knows?” Fader said soft- 
ly. “We aren’t worried about the 
enforcing of arbitrary rules on 
everyone impartially. We ask only 
that a man restrict his actions so 
that they do not threaten or en- 
danger the person, property, or 
happiness of anyone else. Further- 
more, not having been consulted on 
his forcible induction into this 
world, he may choose to play or not. 

JAMES E. GUNN 




If he chooses to play, we ask only 
that he obey the rules of the game 
and leave the rest to chance. 

“But you came to look not to 
listen.” 



T HEY PASSED down the hall 
the tall, lean man, his face 
carved by ten thousand fevered 
nights, and the taller, leaner, more 
subtly jointed being from another 
world who had come to sit in judg- 
ment upon this one. As they en- 
tered the self-service elevator, Fader 
noticed that the alien hummed. As 
they stepped out into the wide 
lobby and walked into the sun- 
bright street, it stopped. 

Fader knew what the technicians 
would tell him. They would say that 
it was a gravity neutralizer or gen- 
erator, or an energy shield or a 
communicator or some other fan- 
tastic thing. They would deduce 
this or that, fit it here or there into 
the puzzle, and eventually they 
would have a complete picture of 
this great Galactic Union. Every- 
thing was useful. 

“Noted/’ said the voice inside his 
head. 

A lean, black cat darted out of 
an alley to their left and paused to 
study them with large, speculative 
eyes. Fader hastily crossed the 
street, beckoning the Examiner to 
follow. 

The Examiner looked thought- 
ful, but said nothing. 

A row of shops were to their 
right, their windows displaying cas- 
ually the goods available within. 
Most of it was handicraft stuff — 
increasingly desirable in an age of 
automatic factories. All was for 
sale; it could be bought with that 

SHILL 



intrinsically worthless stuff — 

money. 

The Examiner passed from a 
window displaying a single, large, 
red tomato to a shop distinguished 
by a bucket swinging from a mast 
anchored above the front window. 
The lettering on the window said, 
“BUCKET-SHOP.” 

“A bucket-shop,” Fader ex- 
plained, “once specialized in gam- 
bling with clients on bets the clients 
couldn’t win, pretending to deal in 
securities that it actually never 
bought. But now there are no 
stocks, no grain futures, no markets, 
and no need for them. Bucket- 
shops today make book on any con- 
tingency the customer chooses, set- 
ting adequate odds to protect them- 
selves. In effect, the customer ac- 
cepts long odds for the privilege 
of choosing his bet.” 

“Then he can bet on anything.” 
“Anything ascertainable. The 
proprietor of this shop, for instance, 
would accept your bet on how many 
molecules of water that bucket 
would hold, whether the next heli- 
jet to land on the hotel roof would 
be a Ford or a Cadillac, whether 
you will die before you reach the 
age of five hundred — ” 

“It serves as a form of insurance, 
then?” 

“It could but it doesn’t. No one 
has any reason to be afraid of the 
future.” 

The public room of the bucket- 
shop was spotless and air-condi- 
tioned. Walls to the right and left 
were miniature, black tote boards. 
On them, in glowing, occasionally 
changing letters and figures, were 
the odds against the occurrence of 
a number of contingencies, in al- 
phabetical order, beginning with 

17 




“Air Temperature (noon).” 

Two rows of comfortable-looking 
chairs were lined back to back down 
the center of the room. The cus- 
tomers in them studied the walls or 
placed their bets with the proprietor 
at the back of the room. He sat be- 
hind a high, wide desk in his black 
coat and green eyeshade. 

“Fader!” he explained. “What 
can I do for you?” 

“Name the odds on rain before 
noon.” 

The man in the green eyeshade 
pointed to the wall at his left. The 
wall announced: 

RAIN 

During the next hour 100-1 

Before noon 25-1 

“Want to take a flyer?” 

Fader shook his head. “Sorry. It 
just might rain, and I’m going to 
need my luck. Are you making book 
on the possible lifting of the quar- 
antine?” 

“No. But I’ll take all bets at ten 
to one over the next fifty years.” 

“It’s your opinion,” the Exam- 
iner asked politely, “that the Gal- 
actic Union won’t lower the bar- 
rier?” 

“That’s the meaning of the 
odds,” he said, studying the Ex- 
aminer as if he were seeing him for 
the first time. “If they’d ever meant 
to take it off, I don’t think they’d 
have put it on.” 

“What odds,” the Examiner 
asked softly, “on man reaching 
outer space?” 

“That’s a different matter,” said 
the man in the green eyeshade. 
“On that you’ll never get more than 
even money from me.” 

“He was expressing his own opin- 



ion, of course,” the Examiner said, 
when they reached the street. 

“That’s all any of us can do,” 
Fader observed. “He’s different 
only in his readiness to put his 
money where his mouth is.” 

“He owns that business clear?” 
“Less the government share,” 
Fader corrected. “For gambling 
profits that’s fifty percent. Govern- 
ment stickmen collect daily — ” 
“That should complicate the 
business of government.” 

Actually, of course, it had simpli- 
fied everything. The few essential 
government expenses were taken 
care of on a daily or weekly basis. 
The remainder was distributed 
periodically as a citizen’s bonus. So 
it returned to those it came from, 
and the circle was complete. 

The government stopped losing 
money. Taxes were eliminated. The 
staggering public debt was retired 
within a few years. 

It was true that the government 
was involved in gambling, but then 
it always had been. Even when 
gambling was generally illegal, most 
states were partners in legalized 
parimutuel betting at the tracks; 
only when bets were offered and 
accepted away from the track — 
where no portion of the money was 
forfeit to the state treasury — was it 
declared illegal. 

In Nevada the state was a part- 
ner in all gambling enterprises — on 
top of taxes and fees — to the tune 
of two percent of the gross. The fed- 
eral government taxed gamblers 
and gambling devices wherever 
they happened to be, irrespective of 
their legality. 

Such schizophrenic standards 
made honesty in government a prac- 
tical impossibility.

JAMES E. GUNN 




Most people and most govern- 
ments never quite made up their 
minds about gambling. Gambling 
always existed on the borderline of 
respectability. 

It would be easier to count the 
societies that did not gamble. Aus- 
tralian and South African bush- 
men competed for prizes. The 
primitive Teutons gambled them- 
selves into slavery like Sudanese 
and West African natives, — who 
first staked wives and children. 
Chinese gamblers wagered their 
right hands and, losing, cut them 
off. Wealthy Romans lost their en- 
tire fortunes on chariot races ; 
Twentieth Century men embezzled 
and went to jail, speculated and 
committed suicide in droves. 

Gambling was always a govern- 
ment preoccupation and often a 
government monopoly. Queen Eliz- 
abeth I established a lottery in 
England. German princes of the 
18th and 19th centuries maintained 
gambling as a state monopoly. Lot- 
teries helped found the United 
States; General Washington bought 
the first ticket in a benefit for the 
U.S. Army. In 1946, Brazil’s treas- 
ury got one-sixth of its income 
from a share in legalized gambling 
enterprises. 

Periodic attempts at suppression 
were based upon the assumption 
that gambling injured the produc- 
tivity of workmen, but sometimes 
it was considered to threaten the 
basic structures and assumptions of 
society. Yet even in the middle of 
the twentieth century, when gam- 
bling was generally illegal, it was 
a $30 billion industry with annual 
profits of $6 billion to its shady pro- 
moters. That was more than the 
combined profits of United States 

SHILL 



Steel, General Motors, General 
Electric, and the remaining ninety- 
seven of the hundred largest United 
States manufacturing companies. 

“But,” Fader pointed out, “with 
the devices you gave us we didn’t 
have to worry about production. 
We didn’t have to, meddle in the 
lives and pastimes of the public.” 

They had reached the residential 
section — colorful, blown-plastic 
houses in neat little green plots. On 
the opposite side of the street was 
a collection of plastic bubbles 
joined by roofed passageways. 

“That’s a schoolhouse,” Fader 
said. “And it seems to be recess.” 



I T WAS an elementary school. 

The playground held a few 
groups of eight or nine years of 
age, and one kindergarten group 
that couldn’t have been more than 
six. 

The last group was close to one 
of the walls. Some of the children 
were kneeling. Others formed a 
circle around them. 

Fader heard the familiar sound 
of two cubes clicking together. “Roll 
’em,” said a childish treble, “you’re 
faded!” 

An arm moved back and whip- 
ped forward. Two transparent dice 
tumbled out, hit against the wall, 
and spun backward until they came 
to rest. 

“Snake eyes!” cried the same 
voice with glee. A boy raked up a 
small heap of coins in the center of 
the circle. 

As the Examiner moved aside, 
Fader heard the voices following 
them. 

“They hit!” 

“They miss!” 

19 




“A natural!” 

“Baby needs a new pair of shoes!” 

“Sixty days. You’ll never make 
it!” 

“And up jumped the devil . 

“Gambling?” the Examiner 
asked, nodding toward the little 
knots of children. 

“Obviously.” 

“Couldn’t they be doing some- 
thing more rewarding?” 

“How?” Fader asked, surprised. 
“This is their education, their prep- 
aration for life.” 

“They study this?” 

“Exactly.” A slow smile played 
over Fader’s lips. I’ll have to watch 
out for some of them — if I’m 
around a few years longer. The 
young ones will be taking over from 
me some day.” 

“Instead of learning about life, 
they learn to play games,” the Ex- 
aminer said, nodding his beautiful 
head. 

“What is life but a game? Their 
education has been re-oriented, 
that’s all.” 

Fader caught the arm of a pass- 
ing boy, a sturdy, bright-eyed fel- 
low. He waited respectfully. 

“What do you learn in school, 
son?” Fader asked. The boy looked 
politely blank. Fader smiled. “That 
was a httle general, wasn’t it? Do 
you learn to read?” 

“Yes, sir,” the boy said. 

“What do you read?” 

“Let’s see.” There’s Hoyle's Rules 
of Card Games. This semester we’ve 
got Scarne on Dice. Next semester 
we’re going to study Jacoby on 
Poker." 

“Can you write?” Fader asked. 

“Yes, sir.” And, without prompt- 
ing, he continued, “We’ve been 
making book, Fader, and filling out 



policy slips, that sort of thing.” 

“Arithmetic?” 

“Elementary odds.” 

“Thanks, boy,” Fader dismissed 
him with a smile. 

Fader spread his arms out wide 
as if he included the world within 
them. “An education must be cen- 
tered around something, and what 
is in the center is relatively unim- 
portant. Gambling, embraces all 
the vital branches of knowledge. It 
concerns itself with sociology, psy- 
chology, and history. It makes nec- 
essary the study of physics, chem- 
istry, electronics, statistical anal- 
ysis, and the scientific method. It 
concentrates on mathematics, odds, 
and the nature of chance and its 
role in the universe. In the sense 
that probability began as a study of 
gambling odds, it gave birth to 
modern mathematics.” 

In secondary school and college 
curriculums the courses became 
more specialized : The Ethics of the 
Gambler, Statistical and Inductive 
Probability, Craps Through the 
Ages (with laboratory), The Un- 
certainty Principle and It’s Coun- 
ter-part in the Macrocosm, The 
Psychology of the Winner, Playing 
Card Design, The Loser’s Ductless 
Glands, Von Neumann’s Theory of 
Games . 

“There is no greater laboratory,” 
Fader said, “for the study of psy- 
chology and sociology than this so- 
ciety. Here things are stripped of 
nonessentials, of all pretense. 
Every day a man can see — and 
run — every mood from the darkest 
gloom to the most ecstatic joy. As 
Nick the Greek said more than one 
hundred years ago, ‘A man will ex- 
pose his deepest emotions for a ten- 
dollar bill.’ ”

JAMES E. GUNN 




F ADER stopped in front of the 
restaurant and glanced up at 
the tote board a few blocks away. 
The situation had already changed. 

FADER MARTIN $ 11 , 503 , 762,016 2-1 

monte jones 5 , 220 , 996,843 25-1 
john head 3 , 101 , 532,791 6-1 

lucky knight 3 , 095 , 466,832 30-1 

Praying John had almost doubled 
his capital. He had won an amazing 
sum of more than a billion dollars. 

Automatically Fader calculated 
the odds. He would give two-to-one 
that he would be forced to meet 
John Head before the week was 
out. A lot of smart money was go- 
ing down on Head ; the odds showed 
that. The lucky man always attracts 
a crowd of side-bettors who hope 
that some of his luck will rub off. 

At the table the Examiner toyed 
idly with a meal of plankton and 
chlorella. Reaching for the salt, 
Fader knocked it over. Salt poured 
out onto the table. Automatically 
he picked up a pinch and tossed it 
over his left shoulder. 

“That seems to belong to the 
same category of actions,” the Ex- 
aminer observed, “as your avoid- 
ance of a black cat this morning. 
Even the meaningless becomes 
significant when persisted in.” 

“If you were around me longer,” 
Fader commented drily, “you 
would notice that I wear this same 
rather threadbare shirt on impor- 
tant occasions, that I go out of my 
way to give money to beggars — ” 
“They are efforts to propitiate 
some forgotten gods, then, in order 
to secure good luck or ward off bad 
hick.” 

Surprisingly, Fader shook his 
head. “There’s nothing forgotten 
about these gods. They’re very 

SHILL 



much alive. Gamblers are super- 
stitious, sure. They have to be. 
Their fates are controlled by 
chance. So are all our fates. We 
would be smart to pay more atten- 
tion to the propitiation of those 
possible controlling powers which 
say to us: win, live, grow — or lose, 
die, diminish. On a hunch, perhaps, 
the gambler hedges his basic bet 
with life. He is familiar with cir- 
cumstances which can scarcely be 
explained except by predicating the 
dominion of the unseen. Luck has 
favorites; it is arbitrary, ironic, de- 
cisive — ” 

“Projection,” the Examiner ob- 
served, “is a familiar phenomenon.” 

“What does a man lose if he acts 
as if chance were a vital, manipu- 
latable entity?” 

“The power of making his own 
decisions.” 

“Those are best left to chance. 
Like this.” Fader’s hand moved. 
The silver dollar glittered in the 
air. “Tails,” he called it, and grim- 
aced. 

The Examiner leaned forward. 
“What decision was that?” 

“Whether I should continue the 
conversation,” Fader answered 
wryly. “The coin said yes. For mil- 
lenia, you see, we chased cause, 
like a pack of dogs after a bitch in 
heat. Where did it take us? To that 
fiery wall you placed above us in 
the sky. Your ship just ‘happened’ 
to be close by when we emerged 
into space.” 

“That’s right.” 

“It was chance, then. Luck was 
with you, sir. Ours had run out. Can 
you blame us, if we look on caus- 
ation with disfavor and set chance 
in its proper place — that of the su- 
preme arbiter of the universe?” 

21 




“It may be natural but it is 
scarcely intelligent — ” 

“Suppose we had reached Mars 
or Venus before you had discovered 
us? You wouldn’t have chased us 
back. Isn’t that right?” 

“I can say only that it has hap- 
pened that way in other cases,” the 
Examiner said gravely. “Then we 
adjusted ourselves to the reality of 
the presence of the uninvited races 
among us. But you were not yet 
in our midst. From our viewpoint, 
we happened upon Earth just in 
time.” 

“So it would seem,” Fader said 
softly. 

“And from your viewpoint,” the 
Examiner went on earnestly. “It 
is not so much a denial of space as 
the establishing of an entrance ex- 
amination. Demonstrate that you 
are capable of making sensible laws 
and abiding by them from no com- 
pulsion except that of logic and we 
will welcome you with great 
warmth and joy. You wouldn’t ad- 
mit a savage into your society un- 
til you were satisfied that he was 
capable of obeying your laws and 
predisposed to do so.” 

“Perhaps not,” Fader admitted. 
“But that presupposes that you 
have property rights on space.” 

“It does,” the Examiner agreed. 
“And we do.” 

Fader studied the Examiner’s 
face, moved for the first time by 
emotion ; what emotion it was, 
Fader couldn’t decide. 

The Examiner went on. “It is 
painful for me to speak bluntly. 
On my world it would be con- 
sidered an insult that you force me 
to do so. Among civilized men, 
offensive speech is unnecessary. 
The facts of existence are apparent 

22 



to everyone. I mention this only to 
excuse my own conduct — ” 

“Because after all,” Fader inter- 
jected, “we are an inferior race.” 
“Your race has an unnatural 
bent for rubbing salt in your own 
wounds. We do have the power to 
restrict any race to its own world. 
The presence of that power im- 
plies the right to use it — ” 

“I have heard that theory ex- 
pressed before,” Fader mused. 
“Then it was called ‘might makes 
right.’ ” 

“It is not only might that makes 
right. Wisdom makes right. In any 
society except the most primitive, 
might and wisdom are only two as- 
pects of the same thing. What we 
have done is forbidden your en- 
trance into our society, defined as 
the area beyond the orbital sphere 
of this particular world’s outer sat- 
ellite. The right to determine the 
constitution of any society belongs 
to the society alone.” 

“You’ve penned up your savage,” 
Fader said. “But you wouldn’t be 
surprised if the savage should try 
to escape?” 

“Surprised, no. Concerned, yes. 
The power of the Galactic Union 
is not lightly invoked.” 

“So we have cause to under- 
stand,” Fader said grimly. 

“Attempts have already been 
made?” 

“Naturally,” Fader said. “How 
could we accept your word for the 
existence of a wall around Earth? 
It might have been a bluff.” 

“The Galactic Union,” the Ex- 
aminer said evenly, “does not bluff. 
It does not need to.” 

“True. In this instance, anyway. 
Ships probed it here, there, where- 
ever there might be a possible hole, 

JAMES E. GUNN 




and they flamed down from it like 
falling stars.” 

“And you discovered only that 
it was there.” 

“That’s right,” Fader said heav- 
ily. “We don’t know to this day 
whether the effect is caused by a 
force field, an ionized layer, mass 
hypnosis, or something completely 
beyond our comprehension.” 

“No reaction said the voice in- 
side Fader’s head. “It must not be 
any of those . Surely he’d have 
twitched a muscle somewhere .” 

“And you won’t find out from 
me,” the Examiner added. “All 
you need to know is that the wall 
will keep you in until we choose to 
remove it.” 

“We wonder,” Fader remarked, 
“how your ship managed to come 
through the barrier — and how you 
will leave. Can you turn off the wall 
at will, does it cut off automatically 
as your ship approaches, or is there 
some immunity in the materials or 
construction of the ship itself?” 

The Examiner shook his head. 

“Precautions have been taken to 
keep us from learning?” Fader 
asked innocently. 

“They have. Less civilized races 
may be tempted to force answers 
from Examiners. That cannot be 
allowed. Reprisals — which I can- 
not itemize or categorize — would 
be taken. Moreover, either I know 
nothing, or the answers are locked 
into a neural pattern which only 
death can dissolve. That is, if you 
are able to put me to the question 
in spite of my considerable ability 
to resist.” 

“You wrong us,” Fader said. 
“Force is the farthest from our in- 
tentions. We are, however, a people 
with free-roving, speculative minds. 

24 



We speculate, for instance, that we 
might be able to learn a great deal 
from an inspection of your little 
ship — ” 

“That, too,” the Examiner said 
firmly, “you cannot do. The port 
can’t be opened without destroying 
the ship. Even if you could enter 
safely, what you saw would be 
meaningless.” 

“Don’t underestimate us,” Fader 
advised easily. “We are a clever, in- 
genius people.” 

“We do not underestimate you. 
But you could no more understand 
the devices inside my ship than a 
bushman could understand one of 
your printed circuits without any 
knowledge of electricity.” 

“This began, I think, with your 
hope that we weren’t trying to 
escape. You’ve seen our rusty ships; 
let them answer.” 

“ Billy’s inside. He just reported.” 

Inside the ship? 

“Right” 

He’s not to touch anything. He 
understands that, doesn’t he? 

“Sure. Don’t worry. He wouldn’t 
know what to touch. He’s just tak- 
ing pictures. He wants to say it’s 
no dice, though. It’s all crazy in 
there. No apparent controls. No 
power plant. Just lots of decora- 
tions. Can’t tell the controls from 
the decorations without a pro- 
gram.” 

Maybe the experts can make 
something out of it. 

“Too bad they can’t get in there 
themselves.” 

That’s the price they pay for be- 
ing experts. 

Fader completed the pushing of 
his chair back under the table and 
looked up. “The next item on the 
agenda is a trial by chance.” 

JAMES E. GUNN 




T HE GLEAN, cheerful court- 
room was identified by a min- 
iature statue of Justice, scales in 
one hand, sword in the other, 
standing on a corner of the desk. 
The desk itself was a transparent, 
red cube decorated with opaque 
white spots. The top was covered 
with green felt. 

The judge behind the desk was 
listening to a summation by a man 
in a green eyeshade and a black 
coat. 

The man in front of the desk 
had, the stickman declared, made 
a bet that be could beat another 
man at a game of chess. The bet 
had been made publicly; the game 
had been played publicly. The ac- 
cused man had won. 

The judge nodded at Fader and 
then asked the accused man if the 
charge were true. 

“I did what he said.” 

“Have you played chess against 
that man before?” 

“Yes.” 

“Did you beat him then?” 
“Yes.” 

“Has he ever beaten you?” 

“No.” 

“I ask you, isn’t it a fact that skill 
is so predominant an element in 
the game of chess that the outcome 
of any one game can be accurately 
predicted?” 

“Well — ’” 

“In every game there is an ad- 
mitted and recognized advantage 
on one side or the other?” 

“Well — yes. But he said he could 
beat me. He thought he could beat 
me. We were betting on a differ- 
ence of opinion.” 

“But you knew — did you not — 
that you were superior, that you 
could beat him, just as you had 

SHILL 



beaten him before?” 

“That was my opinion.” 

“And his opinion to the con- 
trary was only evidence of his ig- 
norance of the game?” 

“Well— I won—” 

“Exactly. You were cheating. 
“Some opinions are founded on 
fact and some are baseless,” the 
judge said. “The person who has 
knowledge and bets in accordance 
with it, is taking an unfair advan- 
tage. To take an unfair advantage 
is to cheat, and cheating will not be 
tolerated.” 

Fifty years ago courts had been 
concerned with the suppression of 
gambling. This society was not re- 
motely concerned with suppression. 
But it was concerned with the 
function of all courts, the preser- 
vation of society. The greatest 
threat against a society based on 
gambling was cheating. Only wide- 
spread dishonesty could incite re- 
bellion and force a return to yester- 
day’s narrow, futile puritanism. 

A game of skill could not be de- 
fined except as a form of cheating. 
It was as reprehensible as the 
loaded dice or the gimmicked 
wheel. In fact, it was even more 
dangerous to society. 

“But understand this,” the judge 
concluded. “Society is concerned 
only with your public acts. What 
you do in private does not concern 
us. But in acting publicly you made 
society the judge of your actions. 
We disapprove. Have you anything 
to say before I pass sentence?” 
“No, sir.” 

“You are fined the full amount of 
the bet,” the judge said sternly, 
“and you are forbidden for a period 
of six months to enter any public 
place where gambling is conducted, 

25 




to place any public bets with any- 
one or by any public method of 
communication. Do you wish to 
appeal?” 

“Yes, sir,” said the convict. 

The judge touched the base of 
the goddess of justice. A door 
sprang open. Out upon the felt top 
of the desk rolled a single, many- 
sided die, on each face of which 
was engraved an “A” or a “D.” It 
stopped with a “D” uppermost. 

“The appeal is denied,” said the 
judge. 

“In our courts,” Fader muttered 
to the Examiner, “justice is not 
only blind, it is as impartial as 
chance.” 

A cab drifted down from the sky 
like a whirling seedpod and waited 
patiently while Fader and the In- 
spector climbed in. Fader whispered 
into the where-box. 

“You have a great preoccupa- 
tion with cheating,” the Examiner 
observed. 

“It’s a serious problem” Fader 
replied soberly. “The basic premise 
of our society is equal opportunity. 
If the odds are rigged in favor of 
anyone, it will result, inevitably, in 
the ultimate destruction of the so- 
ciety. It may not be a perfect so- 
ciety, but it is a good world in 
which no one goes naked, hungry, 
or unsheltered. There is no war, no 
murder, no crime. The ideal form 
of competition is available every- 
where, to everyone. It’s a wide- 
open world, with impenetrable 
skies.” 

“But you have trouble with 
cheating?” 

“Outside of the games of skill, 
no. There is a kind of Gresham’s 
Law of gambling — honest games 

26 



drive out the crooked ones. A 
gambling house that consistently 
rigged the games or the odds would 
soon be deserted; the customers 
would soon transfer their patron- 
age to houses that gave them better 
returns for their money. Games of 
skill are another thing.” 

“Why is that?” # 

“The human critter is funny. He 
has to demonstrate his superiority; 
it’s a compulsion to compete and 
it dies hard. Man can’t stop trying 
to beat the game. That’s what 
makes him unique.” 

“And that,” the Examiner said 
quietly, “is what makes him an 
undesirable. The only citizens we 
can accept are those who will play 
the game according to the rules.” 
“According to your rules,” Fader 
amended. “Life’s only requirement 
is survival.” 

“But when we ourselves decide 
the conditions under which we 
shall survive — then we become 
Life’s master instead of its slave.” 
Fader studied the Examiner’s 
face. It was calm and peaceful ; this 
face, if any, had mastered Life. 
From these lips Man could accept 
the advice of the angels. Fader 
wondered, as he had wondered be- 
fore, if that day one hundred years 
ago had seen the alien’s first visit. 

“Don’t expect the impossible,” 
he said. “Man has always insisted 
on making his own rules as he 
went along. I’m not praising or de- 
fending him. That’s just the way he 
is.” 

“Then he must reconcile him- 
self to seclusion. It is our game, 
and we do make the rules. But no 
race is so rigid that it cannot 
change; no species is so stupid that 
it cannot learn. My only question 

JAMES E. GUNN 




is: can you teach yourselves? So 
far I haven’t found any evidence 
that you can.” 

“What kind of evidence?” Fader 
asked quickly. 

“My visit to this world should be 
the central fact of your society. 
Around it, the school curriculum 
should be developed. The great 
philosophic question of the century 
should be how humanity can make 
itself acceptable to the Galactic 
Union. Instead I find that nothing 
is taught about us, nothing is said 
about us, and nothing is done.” 

Fader smiled wryly. “Here the 
basic facts of life are not the sub- 
ject of classroom discussion. Nor 
do philosophers concern them- 
selves with questions already set- 
tled. What we are doing — that you 
must see for yourself.” 

“Billy’s out . Just reporting . No 
incident.” 

The jets cut out, and the taxi 
hung, swaying, from its rotors. Be- 
low them was a long, dark oval 
around a central field of manicured 
turf. Along one side of the oval 
stretched crowded stands. 

“We should be just in time,” 
Fader said, “for the fourth race.” 



F LASHING the brilliant racing 
colors of their stables, the squat, 
buglike machines raced around the 
oval, jostling each other at the 
turns, falling behind, pushing hard 
to pass in the stretch, and finally 
flashing under the finish line in 
front of the cheering crowd. 

Fader studied the horse in the 
victor’s chute, where it was nuz- 
zling its fill of current, and glanced 
down at his program. Shoo-In, 
Calumet entry, the favorite. He 

SHILL 



looked up at the tote board. The 
horse had paid 5-2. 

In a box a few hundred feet way, 
a knot of young men were yelling 
excitedly, jumping, pounding one 
of their number on the back. Fader 
smiled; someone had a winner. 

“Isn’t it obvious,” the Examiner 
asked politely, “that one of these 
machines is built better than an- 
other, that one is intrinsically 
faster? What uncertainty is there 
to bet on?” 

Horse racing had been man’s 
perenial pastime for millenia, but 
the machine age brought a revo- 
lution. As civilization grew more 
complicated, more urban, people 
became more interested in ma- 
chines than animals. The tracks, 
frantically searching for ways to 
stay in business, had an inspiration. 

Researchers into response and 
learning mechanisms, had de- 
veloped a simple electrical device 
for studying the process. It sought 
out a source of current and charged 
itself, learned a maze, and retraced 
its path to its “food” in shorter 
times. Here, in primitive form, was 
a device which combined mechanics 
with the individuality and uncer- 
tainty of horses. 

The mechanical horses became a 
craze. They took over the tradition, 
color, and ceremony of the track 
instead of the speedway. To the 
public they developed personal- 
ities and recognizable techniques. 
One was smart in the jams; another 
was fast getting away; a third was 
strong at the finish. 

Running times varied consider- 
ably depending upon lubrication, 
overhaul, repairs and innovations, 
track conditions, and a certain in- 
tangible — 

27 




The fifth race was a continual 
human thunder from the starting 
gate sprint to the finish. 

The tote board told Fader that 
his tip had got around. The odds 
on Earthbound had dropped from 
9-1 to 7-2. Like most horseplayers, 
the elevator boy couldn’t keep a 
good thing to himself. “Horseplay- 
ers die broke,” Fader muttered. 

It was Earthbound and Fence- 
buster going toward the wire nose 
and nose. Slowly Fencebuster 
pulled away and flashed across the 
line. 

Fencebuster had come in at 20- 
1. That Earthbound should have 
lost to a dog like that was night- 
mare stuff. 

He shrugged. That’s what made 
horse races. 

“If you like,” he said, as he got 
to his feet, “we can go around to 
the stables and see the horses.” 

They passed close to the group 
of jubilant young men Fader had 
noticed before. 

“Four winners in a row!” one of 
them shouted. “What’re you gonna 
do now, Johnny-boy? Are you 
gonna choose the old man, 
Johnny?” 

He was talking to a dark-haired, 
sullen-looking boy in the center of 
the group. The boy muttered some- 
thing, but Fader and the Examiner 
were already past. 

Johnny ! Fader turned the name 
over and peered . under it. Could 
that sullen boy be Praying John 
Head? 

He knew, with a sick, cold feel- 
ing in the pit of his stomach, that it 
was. 

“You’re right . We’ve got our eye 
on him,” 

Want to hook a bet on how soon 

28 



he chooses me? 

“Nope, He hasn’t quite made up 
his mind.” 

The challenge, Fader knew with 
intuitive certainty, would come be- 
fore the day was over. No matter 
what effect it had on the future of 
all Earth, it would come. 

It was a hell of a time for a boy 
like Johnny to lift himself out of 
the masses and drive for the top. 
But that, after all, was the function 
of the society. 

The horse lay upside down on 
the workbench, its insides strewn 
across the surface. The Examiner 
glanced casually at the haphazard 
arrangement of wires and motors, 
transistors, condensers, and other 
items of electrical equipment that 
Fader couldn’t put a name to. “I 
see,” said the Examiner. 

Fader frowned. Had the alien 
understood it completely in that 
one sweeping glance? 

“I don’t understand this recep- 
torlike mechanism which seems to 
lead to the variable accelerator, 
bypassing the battery.” 

“That,” the greasy mechanic 
said proudly, “is the button. In- 
vented right here in the Calumet 
Stable almost fifty years ago.” 

“And a notable contribution to 
the economy,” Fader added. 

“What does it do?” the Exam- 
iner asked. 

The mechanic wiped his hand 
across his sweaty forehead. It left 
a black smear. “It speeds up the 
horse. That’s what it does.” 

“How?” 

The mechanic scratched his 
head. “Well, the bettors, they hope 
their horses win. If they hope hard 
enough, the button picks it up, see, 

JAMES E. GUNN 




and makes the horse go faster.” 
“An application,” Fader said, 
“of what we call the Rhine Effect.” 
“Some sort of mental control of 
matter?” the Examiner asked skep- 
tically. 

“Yeah,” the mechanic said. 
“Yeah. That’s it.” 

“Have you any proof that there 
is such a thing?” 

“Not what you’d call proof, may- 
be,” the mechanic admitted. “But 
we don’t have any proof that there 
ain’t, either. And it sure pepped up 
the betting.” 

“An increase in the circulation 
of money,” Fader said, “is always 
a good thing.” 

“And is it a good thing to de- 
lude the general public into belief 
in fantasies?” 

“Fantasies?” Fader repeated as 
they threaded their way through 
the crowd heading toward the pari- 
mutuel windows. 

“You have no proof,” the Ex- 
aminer pointed out. 

“Depends on your definition of 
proof. Suppose a man should toss 
a coin into the air and call it heads. 
What would you call it if heads 
came up?” 

“Chance.” 

“Suppose a machine should flip 
it, with a man concentrating on 
making it come up heads, and it 
came up heads one hundred times 
out of one hundred?” 

“Then — possibly — I might sus- 
pect that something immaterial 
was influencing the coin. Have you 
seen that happen?” 

“Not personally,” Fader ad- 
mitted. “But I’ve heard about it. 
My experience as a gambler makes 
me suspicious of anything that con- 
sistently beats the odds.”

“If you were a scientist,” the Ex- 
aminer said evenly, “what you 
would suspect would be any easy 
explanation for phenomena that 
cannot be duplicated under scien- 
tifically controlled conditions. By 
tonight I will have my decision.” 

“And will Earth have it, too?” 
Fader asked. 

“Yes.” 

Fader could not repress a shiver. 
It was a familiar sensation, com- 
pounded of fear and excitement. A 
helijet swooped down at his sum- 
mons. “The Wheel,” he said into 
the where-box. 

The taxi lifted on whirring 
vanes. 

“It would be an honor,” Fader 
remarked, “if you would consent to 
do the drawing in this semi-annual 
lottery. Lottery players are a super- 
stitious lot — even more than the 
rest of us. They like ceremony.” 

“I have no objection,” the Ex- 
aminer said. 

“Good,” Fader said happily. 
“We’ll have to dress you for the 
part.” 



F ADER waited outside the dress- 
ing room. Politely but firmly, 
the Examiner had made it clear 
that he wished to be alone. It 
didn’t matter to Fader. The cam- 
eras would see more than he could. 

When the Examiner finally 
came out, he walked in a blaze of 
glory. The rose-red silk of his 
blouse was sprinkled with dia- 
monds, and his slacks were almost 
stiff with priceless hand em- 
broidery. 

“Policy players,” Fader told him, 
“have a saying: ‘A raggedy man 
wears his hard luck on his back.’ ”

The broad plaza was jammed so 
tightly that it looked pale with up- 
turned faces. The giant, clear- 
plastic wheel was almost filled with 
millions of tiny, white balls. Fader 
held up his hands toward the pallid 
lake. “Let the drawing begin,” he 
said. Hidden microphones picked 
up his words and threw them out 
for the waiting ears. The crowd 
roared like a crashing surf. 

The giant wheel spun until its 
outlines blurred and the clacking 
of the tiny balls against the sides 
was a steady drum roll. It coasted 
to a stop. A small door swung 
open. 

The Examiner reached into the 
wheel and pulled out a ball. It fell 
into two halves. Inside was a slip 
of paper. He read off the number 
printed on it. At the same instant, 
each numeral sprang up, glowing, 
on the board behind him. 

Again the wheel was closed, was 
spun. Again the Examiner reached 
into it. He read off a second num- 
ber. There were twenty prizes, and 
they were drawn in ascending 
order. 

On the ninth draw, a woman’s 
voice screamed, “That’s my num- 
ber!” And the living waters moved, 
rippled, parted, and surrendered 
up a swaying, breathless, middle- 
aged woman. 

As the Examiner reached into 
the wheel for the twentieth time, 
Fader watched with a queer sense 
of urgency. It was as if the lot were 
being cast, as if the alien were 
withdrawing from the great wheel 
of Destiny, Man’s fate. 

The Examiner read the number 
impassively. Behind him the nu- 
merals marched inexorably across 
the top of the board, hushing the 

30 



crowd as if by some ancient magic 
spell. And then the last number 
flashed, and a small section of the 
human lake exploded. 

A young man was tossed above 
it and seemed to ride over its waves 
up to the platform. 

The grand winner was Praying 
John Head. 

He had a whole ticket — no 
tenths or twenties for him. 

Fader moved forward to shake 
Head’s hand. 

Head glowered at him, unmov- 
ing. Slowly, insultingly, he turned 
his back and stared over the crowd 
at the distant tote board. As every- 
one watched, the numbers flick- 
ered, a name was wiped off. 

fader martin $ 11 , 503 , 762,016 5-2 

JOHN HEAD 4 , 892 , 175,432 5-1 

Head swung back toward Fader, 
a bitter smile twisting his young 
lips. He jabbed a finger toward 
Fader as if it were a rapier. “I’m 
choosing you,” he grated out. 

“Now son — ” Fader began pa- 
cifically. 

“Don’t ‘son’ me!” Head ex- 
claimed, shaking his shoulders as if 
Fader had laid his hand on him. 
“You’re challenged. What are you 
going to do about it?” 

Fader shrugged helplessly. “Only 
one thing I can do — ” 

“Then do it. Name the game.” 

“Craps.” 

“The Golden Nugget, then,” 
Head agreed, nodding almost hap- 
pily now that the challenge was ac- 
cepted. “Eight o’clock.” 

Somewhere a woman’s voice was 
calling, “Johnny!” A girl scram- 
bled up on the stage. “Johnny!” 

It was Jan, the girl from the 
Desert Inn tobacco counter. Her 



JAMES E. GUNN 




face was flushed as if she had run 
a long way. 

“Johnny!” she demanded. 
“What are you doing here? We 
were going to win fifty million and 
stop. Now I find that you’ve won 
almost five billion. Where’s it go- 
ing to end?” 

“At the Golden Nugget. Tonight. 
I just chose Fader.” 

“You’re mad!” the girl ex- 
claimed angrily. “What have you 
got to lose? Everything. What have 
you got to gain? You don’t want to 
be Banker.” 

“It’s time somebody took this 
old bastard to the cleaners,” the 
boy said sullenly. “And I’m the one 
to do it. The almighty rule of 
chance! Hah! He’s been Banker for 
twenty-five years. There’s only one 
way he could have stayed there. 
He’s a mechanic. The whole thing’s 
rigged, the whole damned world! 
Well, there’s going to be some 
changes — ” 

“If you go through with this, 
John Head,” the girl began, the 
words frosty and precise — 

Fader put up a hand to stop her. 
“Don’t threaten anything rash. It’s 
all right. We do what we must.” He 
nodded at the boy. “Tonight, 
then!” 

The boy jerked his head in 
acknowledgment and stamped 
away. Fader forgot him immedi- 
ately. It was the Examiner he was 
curious about. 

Glitter Gulch, the greatest con- 
centration of inert gas in the world, 
cast a neon glow for fifty miles into 
the desert. At the comer of Fre- 
mont and Second Street, in the 
heart of Glitter Gulch, was the 
Golden Nugget. Hanging in the air 

SHILL 



high above the building was a blaz- 
ing nugget of gold. 

The floor felt rough under Fa- 
der’s feet as he followed the Ex- 
aminer into the building. It was 
paved with silver dollars, worn 
down now by countless passing feet 
until the cartwheels were only 
polished silver circles in the con- 
crete. 

There were endless banks of slot 
machines at the entrance, chatter- 
ing and chunging continually, and 
there was even a constant tinkling 
of coins into pay-off cups. It was 
Nevada’s pride that the state pro- 
duced more jackpots than jack 
rabbits. 

But the players were grim and 
silent as they fed coins into the 
bandits with automatic precision. 

“Is this pleasure or punishment?” 
the Examiner asked. 

“Pleasure,” Fader replied, smil- 
ing wryly. “There’s an old saying: 
You pays your money and you 
takes your choice.” 

As they passed the Last Chance 
bar, Fader stopped impulsively. 
“Double shot of rye, neat,” he said 
to the bartender in the sleeve gar- 
ters and apron. He turned around 
with the glass and raised it in 
mocking salutation to the Exam- 
iner’s judicial eyes. “To freedom,” 
he said and tossed it down. 

As he set the glass back on the 
bar, he pointed out the diorama 
behind it. It was the desert lashed 
by a thunderstorm, convincingly 
realistic. In the distance was a 
wide, concrete spaceport, swept 
with rain. The ship took off in the 
middle of the storm, its rocket ex- 
haust a paler, more permanent 
lightning. It faded slowly in the 
night until there was only a pin- 

31 




point of flame, and then that, too, 
was gone. The storm quieted as if 
it had been beaten. 

Darkness settled over the dio- 
rama. Suddenly the night was 
broken. A new star was bom into 
it. It hung motionless for a mo- 
ment, flaming. Slowly then it began 
to fall, picked up speed like a spark 
against a black curtain, and like a 
spark it died away. 

“A reminder of the wall?” the 
Examiner asked calmly. 

“Entertainment,” Fader replied. 
“People like to watch. If they 
didn’t, the management would 
take it down. To us it’s not a 
reminder of the wall but a re- 
minder that Man has tried the im- 
possible and failed. But he doesn’t 
give up. He picks up the broken 
pieces and tries once more, just as 
the diorama always begins over 
again.” 

“Courage should have a better 
goal,” the Examiner said. 

The gaming rooms were 
crowded. They threaded their way 
between the tables — craps, black- 
jack, poker, faro bank — the chuck- 
a-luck cages, the roulette wheels, 
the keno boards, and an ancient 
wheel of fortune, bills fluttering 
from the outer rim. 

They heard the immemorial 
argot: “They miss! . Hit me 
easy! . And up another five! . 
The case card is the king of dia- 
monds! . Around and around the 
little ball goes — where it stops no- 
body knows! . Place your bets, 
ladies and gentlemen. .” 

Around one crap table was a 
rope fence. Fader ducked under 
the rope, and held it for the Ex- 
aminer to follow. The Examiner 
glanced at the long green table 

32 



with its white markings and foot- 
high plastic railing as if the rules 
of the game were obvious. “It is 
the privilege of anyone to chal- 
lenge the person directly above him 
in financial standing?” 

“Right,” Fader said. There was 
a glass bowl full of clear, red dice. 
Fader picked out a pair and tossed 
them idly against the railing. They 
turned up a six and a one. 

“You, as the Banker, can only 
be challenged by the person direct- 
ly below you?” 

“Correct.” Fader did tricks with 
the cubes. The dice appeared and 
disappeared out of his hands or 
popped up out of nowhere to bal- 
ance on fingertips. He moved a 
hand forward, and the dice ap- 
peared to spring out of midair. 
They spun around on the green 
felt. A five and a two. 

“For twenty-five years,” the Ex- 
aminer said, “despite the omnis- 
cience of chance, you have beaten 
off all challengers. That seems like 
a statistical impossibility.” 

“What everyone overlooks,” Fa- 
der said wearily, “is the hidden 
advantage of capital. The man 
with the biggest bankroll always 
wins. Chance has to have a little 
time to establish its impartiality. 
The first streak of bad luck wipes 
out the little man. The richest man 
can outlast everyone.” 

Fader looked at the big clock 
on the wall. The hands pointed to 
five minutes after eight. 

W ITH THE addition of John 
Head’s following of young 
men, the crowd around the table 
thickened. Only Jan came through 
the ropes with him. She gave Fader 

JAMES E. GUNN 




a fleeting, apologetic smile as if to 
say, He’s a fool, 1 know, but he’s 
mine. 

It was one more against him, 
but Fader smiled back. 

“Gome over here!” Head 
snarled. Jan went. “Where’s the 
dice?” 

Fader indicated the glass bowl. 
“Take your pick.” 

Head rummaged through them 
until he found a pair he liked. 
“Let’s make it short and sweet. 
One hundred million a roll until 
one of us is stony.” 

“You’re faded,” said Fader. 

A green-visored croupier, do* 
nated by the house, settled a small 
computer at the far end of the 
table. A tote board behind the 
table lit up with the total assets of 
Fader and Head and the odds on 
each. 

Head rolled the dice, leaning 
forward, his face tense, his eyes 
glaring. “Seven!” he demanded. It 
was a natural. 

During the next half-hour, Fad- 
er learned how Head had earned 
the name Praying John. The boy 
exhorted the dice, pleaded with 
them, shouted at them, prayed to 
them, threatened and begged them. 
The dice responded nobly. Head 
made twenty-five straight passes. 
Fader lost 2.5 billion dollars. 

As Fader gathered the dice into 
his large, thick-fingered hands, he 
realized what he was up against. 
Almost every person around the 
table was pulling for Head, betting 
on him, praying with him that the 
dice would be kind. 

Fader glanced back at the board. 
His fortune stood at $9 billion, 
Head’s at $7.3 billion. The odds 
had dropped to even-money, take 

SHILL 



your pick. 

“Billy says he can’t do a thing 
from this distance, and it’s too late 
to get closer. Too much interfer- 
ence, he says . You’re on your own.” 

I’ve been on my own for a long, 
long time . 

Fader swung around and 
whipped out the dice. Seven! He 
rolled again. A trey! He stared at 
it for a moment as if he couldn’t 
believe it. He scooped up the dice 
and rattled them against the rail- 
ing. “Nine from Carolina!” he said. 
“And again!” 

“Up jumped the devil!” Head 
said gleefully. Fader had sevened- 
out. 

When Fader got the dice back 
the totals were only $700 million 
apart. Slowly, in spite of everything 
he could do, Fader lost 

At three a.m. Praying John 
sevened-out. He took a deep breath 
and spun around to study the 
board. The totals stood at $8.15 bil- 
lion apiece. 

He swung back. “Let’s get this 
over with. Shoot the roll!” 

“Everything?” Fader asked 
quietly. He looked old and gray 
and tired. It had been a hard day 
— the hardest of his life, perhaps. 
Now this young high-roller goaded 
him to shoot the works on one roll 
of the dice. He rubbed his hands 
back and forth, the dice turning 
between them. His hands were still 
steady and sure. 

“Your dice,” the boy said. 

“Shoot it,” Fader said. 

“You’re faded!” 

It was, without a doubt, the 
highest roll in the history of craps. 

Fader whipped the dice against 
the rail. They bounced off and 
tumbled backward. When they 

33 




stopped, there was a five on one 
die, a four on the other. 

“Strychnine!” Head shouted, re- 
laxing a little. 

“Ninety days,” Fader muttered. 

He had swept up the dice in- 
stantly. He blew on them and 
tossed them out again. A one and 
a three. Then two fives. A six 
and a four. Two fives. A six and a 
five. A one and a three. 

Out of the corner of his eye, he 
studied John Head. The boy’s eyes 
were glazed with concentration ; 
sweat beaded his forehead and 
trickled down his nose to drop in 
black spots on the green felt. 

Unexpectedly, Fader rolled the 
dice. Head started and looked 
down at the settling dice, his fore- 
head suddenly creased. One die 
was a three. The other spun on one 
corner and then toppled. A six. A 
three and a six. Nine. Fader had 
made his point. 

Praying John Head was broke. 
Incredulous, he stared down at the 
dice. 

The Examiner, who had been 
watching impassively throughout 
the long game, stepped forward 
and put his long, thin hand over 
the dice. “May I?” he asked po- 
litely. 

Fader forgot about Head and 
studied the Examiner’s face as if 
there were some way to read it, if 
he only knew how. 

E XCEPT for a diehard poker 
game still in session in a dis- 
tant corner and the far-off inter- 
mittent rhythm of the slot ma- 
chines, the room was deserted. 
Fader sat wearily beside the crap 
table. He held a die between his 

34 



fingers by diagonally opposite cor- 
ners. It rotated in his fingers. 

The Examiner studied the dice 
he had picked up. He looked up at 
Fader. The Recording Angel , 
Fader thought. “My decision has 
been made,” he said. 

“Was it ever in doubt?” Fader 
asked. 

“I have learned enough about 
man to know that you wouldn’t 
believe me if I said yes.” 

“You’re right,” Fader agreed, his 
lip curling just a little. “The deci- 
sion is — no dice. No admittance.” 
The Examiner nodded slowly. 
“We are not primarily concerned, 
you see, with the standards or goals 
of your society. What we are con- 
cerned with, is whether that so- 
ciety works. My conclusion is that 
it does not.” 

“Do you mind telling me how 
you arrived at it?” 

“Not at all.” The Examiner 
tossed up the transparent red cubes 
and caught them. “The very bases 
of your society are false. Your rea- 
son for staying as head of this so- 
ciety for twenty-five years was spe- 
cious. The only way you could do 
that was to cheat.” 

“You’re wrong, there,” Fader 
said quietly. “It’s been necessary 
only a few times. Each time it has 
hurt.” The very softness of his 
voice gave evidence of the depth 
of his emotion. “Each time it was 
more important that I win.” 

The Examiner’s smile was sad. 
“It always is. I can’t accept your 
statement as truth; you realize that, 
don’t you? And even if it were, you, 
as the prime representative, stand 
for the society. A few times is as 
damning as always.” 

“How did you find out?” Fader 

JAMES E. GUNN 




asked curiously. 

The Examiner held out the dice. 
“They can’t throw craps or sevens. 
One die has two ones, two fives, 
and two sixes; the other has two 
threes, two fours, and two fives. 
Since each number is placed oppo- 
site its duplicate and since no one 
can see around comers, no dupli- 
cated numbers are visible. No won- 
der you won that last bet. The 
shooter couldn’t lose. All he had to 
do was keep throwing until his 
number came up again.” 

“Okay,” Fader said, shrugging. 
“They’re busters. But would you 
condemn a world for one pair of 
educated dice?” 

“As a symptom of sick society, 
they are sufficient. Earth is sick, 
and humanity is sick. The prime 
representative is a liar and a cheat 
and a criminal, even in the eyes 
of his own society.” 

Fader looked up at the saintly 
face of the Examiner. More than 
ever he looked like Michael, the 
avenging angel. 

“We found you tom and be- 
wildered, groping wildly for the 
stars before you had even solved 
the simple problems of social living 
and the distribution of food. We 
gave you power and a means of 
using it, and you let it lead you into 
decay instead of liberation. Instead 
of freeing yourself from environ- 
ment, you immediately set to fash- 
ioning a new, falser environment.” 

“Sick,” Fader murmured. 

“Sick,” the Examiner repeated. 
“Sick inside where it is worst. Your 
society has grown all lopsided. 
There is such a thing as chance. 
But what is significant is how we 
react to chance. We can try to 
dominate it — and that becomes 



skill and science. Or we can ac- 
cept it as hopelessly beyond con- 
trol ; we can court it — and we have 
magic and animism. 

“Why do men gamble? It is 
their surrender to the omnipotence 
of chance. It strips the relationship 
of man to his fate down to stark 
simplicity. ‘Am I lucky or un- 
lucky?’ asks the gambler. The dice 
answer. And the answer is destruc- 
tion. 

“The animistic mind pleads with 
fate; the scientific mind tries to in- 
sure that fate will be favorable by 
forcing it to be favorable. As bio- 
logical experiments, only the sci- 
entific response has furthered hu- 
man progress. As an evolutionary 
experiment, only scientism has 
proved workable, because it alone 
increases our capacity to survive. 

“As a valid experiment by be- 
ings, in their incessant quest to in- 
crease their power, gambling must 
be rejected as a mutation that has 
failed. The gambler’s question to 
Destiny, the ultimate father surro- 
gate, ‘Am I favored?’ not only 
denies that Fate can be dominated, 
but it rejects the very thought 
ways that lead to an increase in the 
domination of fate.” 

“Are you finished?” Fader asked, 
and his face seemed gray with 
fatigue. 

“I can only add,” the Examiner 
said gently, “that I hope Mankind 
turns away from this false road and 
finds itself back on its way to ful- 
fillment and the stars.” 

“Very noble,” Fader said. “Very 
moral. You come here with your 
angel face and your spotless hands, 
and you say, ‘Stop, my friends! 
Gome no farther until you are 
pure, like us! And we will give 

35 



SHILL 




you gifts so that you may put all 
your efforts into becoming pure 
of heart. 5 Nuts! 

“Your hands aren’t clean! 
They’re whited over like sepulchers. 
Why did you object to our entering 
your saintly society? Because we 
were too struggling, too violent, too 
raw, too competitive. And you’ve 
stopped struggling, except to keep 
what you have. Sure we’re cheat- 
ers, sometimes, and mean, some- 
times, and crude, often. The won- 
der is that we’re ever anything else, 
and we are. 

“But you didn’t want us among 
you. Instead you supplied us with 
power and the means to use it. 
Why? Was it out of a spirit of 
sweet charity? Ah, no! Was it even 
a conscience-money bribe? No, sir! 
It was a Greek gift, and we would 
have been wise to inspect it closely 
to see what secret things were hid- 
den inside. Because these gifts 
made unnecessary our unrelenting 
struggle against environment — that 
struggle which took us all the way 
into space before you chanced 
upon us.” 

Fader was on his feet looking up 
into the Examiner’s face, his voice 
loud and angry. “What was the 
motive behind that gift? It was in- 
tended to lead to that very degen- 
eration and decay you come now 
to complain of. 

“If this is what you wanted, it 
seems that you have succeeded.” 

The Examiner took a deep 
breath, but his expression didn’t 
change. “It saddens us to be mis- 
understood,” he said. 

“But not half as much,” Fader 
taunted, “as to let anyone among 
you who might not respect your 
rules. I’ll tell you what decay is. 

36 



It’s when the rules become so crys- 
tallized that they can’t be broken.” 

The Examiner spread his hands 
helplessly. “There is nothing I can 
say.” 

“You might answer this,” Fader 
said bitterly. “There must be other 
races in the same position as hu- 
manity. How many of them have 
passed their entrance exams?” 

The Examiner studied Fader si- 
lently. 

“I’ll answer it myself,” Fader 
said slowly. “The answer is ‘none.’ 
There was never a chance, you see, 
unless we made ourselves over into 
your image, and that we couldn’t 
do even if we wanted to. We 
wouldn’t play. The game was ob- 
viously rigged against us. And 
there is something rotten about the 
demands that we sit in the game.” 

“I will be back,” the Examiner 
said, turning away, “in fifty years.” 

“Never mind,” Fader yelled 
after him. “Maybe we’ll come out 
to you.” 

Out of the darkness behind him 
came a single, violent word : 
“Traitor!” 

Fader turned wearily. “Who’s 
that?” 

It was Praying John Head, his 
face twisted into a scowl. Behind 
him was Jan, clinging to his hand. 
Her eyes searched Fader’s face. 

“You didn’t even try to impress 
him,” Head said bitterly. “You 
tried to make him mad. Why don’t 
you want the wall tom down? I 
can’t figure you. For money you 
can’t ever use you throw away 
Man’s one chance to reach the 
stars.” 

“I didn’t think you’d cheat,” 
said the girl wistfully. 

JAMES E. GUNN 




“Then you noticed it, too. These 
old hands must be getting stiff.” 

“I asked Johnny to come back 
to talk to you before he made a 
public protest. I told him you had 
to have a reason. You do, don’t 
you?” 

“Yes.” 

“Did it concern the Examiner?” 
“Partly.” 

“Then you did want him to de- 
cide against Earth!” Head ex- 
ploded. 

“That’s right,” Fader said. 
“Traitor!” Head repeated. 

“Let me explain it,” Fader said, 
shrugging, “and then you can de- 
cide whether the word fits. It 
doesn’t matter now, because we 
have fifty years before the Exam- 
iner returns. If we haven’t bypassed 
the wall by then, we never will.” 
“Bypassed?” Jan asked. “How?” 
“I’ll get to that,” Fader said. 
“You accused me of cheating. I 
presume you spotted the busters 
that the Examiner saw. But did 
you see these?” He held up one die 
between his fingers again and let 
it rotate. 

“Loaded!” the boy exclaimed. 
“And even with these I couldn’t 
win,” Fader said ruefully. “I’d say 
that there was a rather powerful 
force working against me.” 

“But that’s — there’s nothing 
wrong with that,” Head protested. 

“So you say. How many straight 
passes can you throw?” 

“Well, I can throw ’em all night, 
but I thought — ” 

“Exactly,” Fader said. “You’re 
loaded with PK. You can control 
the dice with your mind better than 
I can hope to do with my hands. 
They’re both cheating. You’re skill- 
ful in one way; I’m skillful in an- 

SHILL 



other. We both try to evade chance 
results. Man is a cheater. He al- 
ways has been. He always will be. 

“What happened when our 
world was quarantined? We turned 
to gambling. Why? That was the 
answer I didn’t want the Examiner 
to find. But I couldn’t hide it from 
him. All I could do was to keep 
shuffling the little pea under the 
walnut shells and hope that he 
couldn’t follow. Shell game.” 

“But what was the pea?” Jan 
asked. 

“The real function of our so- 
ciety. Every society rewards a spe- 
cific type and tries to breed more 
of them : philosophers, soldiers, 

knights, authors, explorers, scien- 
tists, inventors, businessmen. , . 
Our society happens to reward the 
best gambler.” 

“You?” Head asked bitterly. 

Fader laughed easily. “No, not 
me. Look at it this way! When hu- 
manity needs a certain quality, it 
can’t breed it as the race horse was 
bred for speed. There’s no one to 
breed him, and Mankind is forever 
a wild animal, always unspecial- 
ized. So what happens? We depend 
on evolution. 

“When environment made mus- 
cles valuable, men had muscles. 
When brains were rewarded, men 
developed brains. When these be- 
come relatively worthless, natural 
selection ceases to operate in their 
favor. They degenerate. If a Nean- 
derthal man should catch me alone, 
he could tear me apart — but give 
me a little time to build weapons 
and traps, and he wouldn’t have a 
chance. 

“Then the aliens came, and both 
muscles and brains became worth- 
less. The aliens were obviously so 

37 




superior to ils that we could never 
hope to catch up. The solution had 
to be one that involved neither 
muscles nor brains. 

“Some men defy Nature. They 
find purpose in the universe, intel- 
ligence behind Creation, guidance 
in the selections of evolution. But if 
there is any purpose, any intelli- 
gence, any guidance — it seems to 
me that it lies inside the great, un- 
conscious beast that is humanity. 

“That collective, amorphous 
thing is stubborn and hard-headed. 
It won’t die easy. If it can’t survive 
one way, it will survive another. It 
will run fast when running fast 
will save it, grow muscles when 
muscles are necessary, develop 
brains when brains are vital. 

“In the face of this new chal- 
lenge, there developed — not a new 
talent, but a new society. Was it by 
chance? Perhaps. But it’s signifi- 
cant that this society selected the 
one talent that could save hu- 
manity. 

“PK. Psychokinesis. From the 
mental control of matter it’s a 
small step to teleportation — not to 
mention the possibilities of telepa- 
thy, extrasensory perception, clair- 
voyance, and the direct control of 
destiny.” 

Jan turned excitedly to the boy 
beside her. “Don’t you understand, 
Johnny? You’re one of the people 
who will help put Man out among 
the stars.” 

“You’re the one-eyed jack,” 
Fader said, “the wild card in the 
deck. And you, too, Jan. You’re 
talented, and your children will be 
more talented. It always works that 
way. Money marries money. Intel- 
ligence marries intelligence.” 

Head was still sullen. “I don’t 

38 



see why we had to do it the hard 
way.” 

“That’s the way man is,” Fader 
said simply. “He insists on doing 
things his own way or not at all — 
because he wants to, not because 
he’s permitted. When we go into 
space — and we will — it’ll be on our 
own terms, not on the terms of the 
Galactic Union. We’ll go because 
no one can stop us. And we’ll stay 
there because no one can make us 
go back! 

“The aliens wanted to make us 
over into images of themselves. 
That’s a perennial impossibility — 
as any woman in love must recog- 
nize.” Fader glanced at Jan and 
smiled. “And, like a woman in love, 
if they want us they’ll have to take 
us as we are. Or, for that matter, 
if they don’t want us.” 



T HE CASINO was dark and 
silent. Only the single light cast 
a cone of brightness over the green 
crap table. 

“That’s the other reason you 
had to lose,” Fader said softly. “It 
isn’t good for struggling young 
men to come into money. A hun- 
gry fighter is the best fighter.” 
“Then, even if the Examiner 
had wanted to,” Jan said, “you 
didn’t want him to pass Earth. The 
reason for developing our special 
talents would have vanished, and 
we’d have come in as a hopelessly 
junior partner forever.” 

“True,” Fader said. “Mean- 
while I’ve had to try to suppress 
scientism. Scientism is always Man’s 
reaction to chance. That’s his eter- 
nal struggle — to reduce the role of 
chance and increase the effect of 
skill. He cheats. In one form it’s 



JAMES E. GUNN 




science; in another it’s psi, the at- 
tempt to control chance directly, 
a mutation that is just coming to 
flower . 55 

Head began hesitantly, “It 
sounds like we’re drawing to an 
inside straight , 55 Head objected. 

“So far , 55 Fader said, “we’ve put 
a man on the moon — 55 

The boy smiled luminescently. It 
was like the drawing of a dark 
curtain from a window facing the 
sun. “That’s beyond the barrier!” 

Fader nodded. “Soon we’ll be 
able to put a man anywhere in the 
galaxy. Then let the Galactic 
Union reckon with Earth. Let 
them come to terms with us ! 55 

“What are we waiting for ? 55 
Johnny demanded. “There’s work 
to be done.” 

Fader sighed wearily as if he had 
just realized that he was very old 
and very tired. He sank back onto 
the stool. 

“The Examiner’s getting into 
his ship . Oh, man , am I tired! This 
long-distance telepathy should be 
on union hours. Til be burnt out 
for a month” 

Thanks , Louis . You’ve done a 
good job. One recruit, coming up. 



“Examiner just took off in a 
blaze of nothing. Bon voyage, and 
all that!” The voice in Fader’s head 
began singing Aloha off-key. Fader 
grated his teeth and swore he’d 
have the surgeons open up his right 
mastoid and put a cut-off switch 
on the little receiver. 

Shut up! he thought savagely at 
the distant telepath. I’ve got 
enough head noise of my own! 

“You go, son,” he said to 
Johnny. “My work is here.” 

“What do you mean?” Jan 
asked. Her voice was alarmed. 

“The new worlds are for the 
young,” said Fader, looking a little 
like Moses, who led his people to 
the promised land but could not 
enter himself. “I’ve got no psi. 
I’m just a tinhorn gambler without 
talent who has stayed where he is 
because of an encyclopedic mem- 
ory, some manual dexterity — and a 
little outside help. I’m just a shill.” 
“A shill?” Head echoed. 

“That’s what I am. A shill!” 
Slowly a smile rose across the tired 
crags of his face. “But if a man has 
to be a shill, at least it’s something 
to be shill to the whole wide uni- 
verse.” • • •

three weeks ago. first one to say it. 

Captain Nicholas Joel watched Thin, quiet Sam, who’d been in 
them, their excitement a visible space as ship’s surgeon and psy- 
thing as they pounded up clouds of chiatrist for as long as Joel himself, 
saffron behind them, and knew It had been twenty-two years since 
without activating his personal they’d left the Academy together, 
communicator what they’d have to Sam had taken his specialty train- 
tell him. ing in space medicine, while he, 



41 




Joel, had let himself get sucked into 
qualifying as pilot. 

Twelve years of the Academy. 
And twenty-two more being or- 
dered around the freezing hell of 
God’s black universe like a toy on a 
string. 

And for all of it, Sam still had 
that look in his dark, brooding eyes 
— the look that had been glazed 
with shock, but which had still not 
surrendered, the day they told Sam 
he wasn’t going to make pilot. 

The look would still be there four 
minutes and thirty seconds from 
now when he led the others into 
the fore-waist bridge to holler “We- 
’ve hit it again!” It would always be. 

Joel tilted the liquor bottle and 
one big, clumsy-looking hand 
poured steadily into the thick glass- 
ite flagon he held in the other. He 
downed it in a gulp. 

Hit it again hell! 

An behind Sam there would be 
the first officer, Dobermann. Little, 
wiry German who knew more about 
languages and semantics than the 
guy who’d invented them, and the 
best astro-navigator you could find 
in this or any other galaxy. Sure, 
they always gave Nicholas Joel 
nothing but the best. That was part 
of it. Part and parcel of the whole 
damn conspiracy. 

Dobermann wouldn’t say any- 
thing when he came in. But there’d 
be a thorough-going, sucessful, mis- 
sion-accomplished look on his 
handsome face. Dobermann never 
missed. 

And Southard. Still a kid, still 
wet behind the ears, but a hell of 
a promising astrophysicist, backed 
up with plenty of biochemistry and 
geophysics. It was still a big, ro- 
mantic adventure to Southard, and 



he wore the single red, gleaming 
stripe of ship’s second officer on his 
broad young shoulders as though it 
was the thick gold circle of a full 
captaincy. 

Joel filled the flagon and emptied 
it a second time. He went back to 
the windows, the liquor bottle and 
flagon still in his hands. 

To most men, he supposed, the 
panorama that spread for miles 
from the stem of the up-ended 
White Whale would be a thing of 
sheer beauty. It would be hard for 
them to believe that there existed 
other planets far beyond the rim of 
their own hostile Solar System 
which could equal or exceed the 
soft beauty of the oasis they called 
Earth. But there it was — gently- 
rolling, golden desert beneath a 
temperate, dark-gold sun, flanked 
at one gently curving edge by a 
forest that looked as though it had 
been scientifically planned and 
landscaped for beauty. It was a big 
forest that covered a full third of 
the planet, and at its opposite edge 
it gave way to twelve thousand 
miles of unblemished shoreline 
which descended into gleaming, 
azure ocean. 

And in the forest, on the ocean, 
even on the wide expanse of desert, 
there were people. Intelligent, 
strong, peaceful, quiet people, who 
might have been natives of Earth’s 
Pacific islands of three centuries 
ago, save that their flesh was lighter 
in tone; their sun was not as young 
as Sol. 

Farmers, mostly, Carruthers had 
reported. Some merchants, some 
travelers and explorers, even some 
men of a very young science, but, 
mostly, farmers ... it was the way 
they lived. A good way, Joel 

FOX B. HOLDEN 



42 




thought. A good way, in a good 
place. 

He looked through the fore-waist 
bridge windows, and what he saw 
was beautiful. 

But he filled the flagon again. 

A buzzer sounded softly from the 
compact secondary control console 
which banked a full third of the 
bridge’s fore bulkhead, and deliber- 
ately, Joel let it buzz a second and 
a third time before he fingered the 
stud that slid the small metal door 
open behind him. He turned as 
they came through it. 

Fatigue and sweat lined Sam’s 
thin face; Dobermann was audibly 
out of breath. Southard had to 
duck slightly to get into the room, 
but when he straightened he 
seemed as fresh as when the party 
had left the ship seventeen days be- 
fore. 

Joel returned their salute with 
the full flagon still in his left hand, 
and then beat Carruthers to the 
punch. 

“All right, so we’ve hit it one 
more time! Bully for us — ” He 
drained the flagon, reached for the 
bottle. 

Without Carruthers, there would 
have been an awkward silence. But 
after twenty- two years, Sam knew 
his man. 

“Ahh, you’ve shown us more than 
this, Skipper. I suppose it is a little 
better than our prelim reports in- 
dicate, if you want to get technical. 
The people want to co-operate. 
They’re intelligent, healthy, and 
friendly and they realize fully what 
we’re trying to do. They want to 
help us, and say we’re welcome to 
all the mneurium-4 we want. 
’Course there’s only a few hundred 
pure megatons of it lying around, 

TASK MISSION 



but, if you want to get technical — ” 

“Go to hell,” Joel said, and 
poured his flagon half full. He felt 
a little better, but it would take 
more than a half-bottle of Martian 
Colony Bond and Sam’s wise an- 
swers to change things. “Go right 
straight to hell!” He sniffed at the 
Bond. “So the long arm of Superior 
Civilization has reached out its 
clanking claws again to make the 
Universe a Better Place to Live in, 
has it? God help ’em if they be- 
lieved all the hog-wash you fed ’em, 
Sam.” 

The thin face sobered. “I spoke 
to them in good faith, Nicholas, and 
they did believe me. The fact is, 
they — ” 

“All right, I get your point! Got 
my mind made up, so don’t start 
confusing me with facts.” He trans- 
fixed the three of them with a rest- 
less look; a look they had grown 
used to. It was a gaze that matched 
the rest of him; the unruly, un- 
trimmed black hair, the short, thick 
beard which was unneeded on a 
chin and jaw as big and square as 
Joel’s, the careless, unmilitary car- 
riage of his thick shoulders and 
blocky body, the blood-shot metal- 
blue eyes themselves. But during the 
split-second the gaze was upon 
them, they knew pages were flip- 
ping in Joel’s massive head. Pages 
of regulations, procedures, memo- 
rized down to the last foot-note. 

“Let’s go in order with your re- 
ports,” Joel snapped. 

Southard stepped forward. “Con- 
stellation Bootis, Arcturus, planet 
IV. Preliminary analysis of ore- 
samples indicate rich lodes of 
mneurium-4, relatively close to the 
surface, and in unprecedentedly 
great number. Purity is unbeliev-

ably high, with — 55 

“All right, Southard, good re- 
port. Dobermann.” 

“Minimum of linguistic difficul- 
ty, coupled with a surprisingly high 
aptitude on the natives’ part for 
language learning. In the seventeen 
days I had with them, I’m almost 
certain those with whom I worked 
learned at least half as much Eng- 
lish as I did of their tongue,” the 
German said. He added, simply, as 
though the seventeen days of ex- 
hausting gesticulating, diagram- 
ming, systematizing, learning, re- 
cording, had never existed, “There 
will be no language difficulty, sir.” 
“Good. Now you, Sam, and no 
shmaltz!” 

“Healthy people, no cancer, no 
TB, no coronary troubles — ” 

“The mneurium-4, I know. Go 

jj 

on. 

“Average IQ in the 120’s — and 
there’s something for us to keep in 
mind in spite of our big technologi- 
cal and scientific jump on them. 
They’re still working with wood, 
iron and crude steel, but they won’t 
be for long. Agrarian civilization so 
far; they’ve got a representative 
type of government— democracy, 
and a damn good one, and they’re 
psychologically suited for just what 
they’ve evolved along that line. 
They actually practice what they 
preach, from the individual status 
right on up through the frame- 
work of their government. Open, 
honest, sincere — they have to be, 
because of the high degree of uni- 
formity of IQ, and because — now 
get this — they want to be. It’s the 
way their minds are built, and — ” 
“All right, so if I believe you, 
we won’t be fighting to get what we 
want. They’re willing to meet our 

44 



terms, that it?” 

“Yes, skipper. Access to all scien- 
tific data with which we can supply 
them now, and as much more later 
as they think they’ll require, in ex- 
change for reasonable mining 
rights.” 

“Reasonable?” Joel thundered. 
He slammed the heavy bottle down 
on the old-fashioned mahogany 
desk at his elbow. “Was that in the 
contract you made with them? 
How do you know what the hell 
they mean by reasonable?” 

“Sir, if I may—” 

“All right, Dobermann, go ahead 
and enlighten me.” 

“I worked a number of hours 
with them on that point, to make 
certain there would be no errors in 
the semantics involved. They have 
learned, despite their lack of scien- 
tific medical knowledge, that as 
long as there is mneurium-4 
around, they don’t get sick. They 
trust us to leave enough to insure 
their own well-being.” 

“That’s crazy,” Joel shot back at 
his first officer. “How in God’s 
name can they know about mneuri- 
um-4 and how to use it when we’ve 
only known about it and have been 
scratching the universe for it for 
less than thirty years? That’s god- 
dam nonsense — ” He refilled the 
flagon, spilled a little of the potent 
liquor on his beard as he downed it. 

“No, Nicholas,” Sam said. 
“You’re the bug on history around 
here. Think a minute.” 

Joel drew a sleeve across his 
mouth, and pages flipped in his 
head again. Yes, Sam was right. 
Back as far as the twentieth cen- 
tury, there had been isolated tribes 
in South America which had been 
found free of the diseases that had 



FOX B. HOLDEN 




plagued their more civilized neigh- 
bors of the north, arid it had taken 
the medical experts years to find 
out exactly why. Invariably, the 
answer had been usage of the most 
promising materials provided by 
nature which were closest at hand. 
A tribe stumbled onto something, 
used it — experimentally at first, 
then wastefully, but finally, with a 
thousand years’ practice, pretty ef- 
ficiently. And it had nothing to do 
with the fact that they still went 
around with spears and animal-hide 
shields. 

“All right, I get your point, 
Sam,” Joel said. Sam quit talking, 
and for a moment there was silence 
in the limited confines of the fore- 
waist bridge. Then Joel put the 
bottle and the flagon down on the 
desk, turned his back to it and faced 
them. 

“From the way you boys talk 
this thing up, it all must be just 
jim-dandy. Maybe better than on 
that rock back in Aldeberan, or 
even better than we did in Altair, 
or Fomalhaut, or Procyon Seven, 
or any of the rest of ’em. .” He 
paused again, watched their faces. 
They remembered — all except 

Southard, who hadn’t been with 
them on any of the old strikes. But 
his youthful enthusiasm just about 
made up for the fierce pride that 
shone in the eyes of the others. 

B ack home, the white 

Whale, of all of Earth’s great 
fleet of Explorer-class ships, had 
hung up the most enviable record. 
She had brought back rare ele- 
ments known to men but unobtain- 
able by them within the confines of 
their own tiny Solar System, or rare 

TASK MISSION 



life-forms, impossible to study ef- 
fectively in their native habitats, or 
precious new data which were be- 
yond the reach of the astronomer’s 
observatory. It meant progress. It 
meant a living force in the universe, 
a force of learning and of knowing, 
which would tolerate no barrier, 
which would broach neither defeat 
nor ultimate conclusion. In short, it 
meant Man. 

Nicholas Joel knew it, and he still 
hated space. 

Since that first indoctrination 
blast out to the moon and back 
when he’d been a plebe — since that 
day that he’d realized for the first 
time how big it was. And how big 
men ought to be, but weren’t. Big 
muscles, but little minds. 

He still wondered just how the 
hell they’d sucked him in. They’d 
hit him somewhere inside, in a place 
he’d forgotten to guard — his in- 
structors, his Commandant, the 
Secretary of Science himself. 
They’d sweet-talked him into stay- 
ing those twelve years. Young man, 
they had told him, yours is a body 
and a brain with an adaptability to 
space exploration the like of which 
has never been duplicated in our 
records. You hate to fly, yet you are 
the best cadet pilot ever to enter 
the Academy. You dislike technical 
and scientific study, yet your grades 
in this field are the highest on 
record. You despise the regimen of 
the military necessary to survival in 
Space, yet, unaccountably, your 
cadet commands have been the 
most efficient and best handled of 
any in our knowledge. 

Young man, they had said, here’s 
the works on a silver platter — be a 
pilot — you owe it to yourself, to the 
world, to humanity! 

45 




Say you’ll take our ships where 
no other man would dare, and you 
can write your own ticket for the 
rest of your life! But you simply 
have to be a Pilot , young man. 

And he remembered how it had 
been with Sam, who would have 
moved the Earth with arms and 
legs tied behind him to have quali- 
fied. Sam, who had hungered for it, 
but had taken a lesser assignment 
cheerfully, just so, at least, he could 
be a part of some other pilot’s team 
in space. 

Sam, who had that look in his 
eyes. 

But since his assignment to the 
White Whale fifteen years ago, 
there had never been a sign — not 
the slightest, that Joel had been 
able to detect, that he was doing 
anything but what he most wanted. 
That took guts, and guts. Joel un- 
derstood. 

And so now they’d hit it again. 
Mneurium-4, the “wonder-ele- 
ment” that science had discovered 
would put a host of Earth’s most 
dreaded diseases to rout, but which 
it had not been able to obtain or 
synthesize despite years of exhaus- 
tive effort. 

Captain Joel, they had told him, 
the radio-astronomers say there 
could be mneurium-4 somewhere 
out in Bootis. Get some. 

And in spite of them and their 
damned passion for onward-and- 
upward, if they insisted he pilot 
space to bring them back one new 
gew-gaw after another to play with, 
then he’d bring them back gew- 
gaws until they choked! Choked! 

And the world he wanted — the 
world he’d always wanted, would 
just have to be for somebody else. 

Then he looked at their faces, 

46 



and they were waiting. 

“All right, I get your point! 
Don’t just stand there — Southard, 
get your ’copters going! I want a 
fully plotted area of operation for 
the next six months, including 
jump-off point as of tomorrow at 
0600 hours, and on this desk by 
2200 tonight! Dobermann, you 
won’t have anything to do for 
awhile, so you can get Southard’s 
servodrillers going for him ; get ’em 
all out, form ’em on the port flank 
in details of five. I want to see it by 
2100. Sam, has Dobermann given 
you any practice in their lingo? 
Good — all right, it’s time I met ’em 
— you’ll take me to their capital 
city or wherever it is their top 
people are and we’ll get things 
down in black and white. I’ll be 
ready for you in twenty minutes. 
Any questions?” 

There weren’t. Joel’s three offi- 
cers turned and left, each scram- 
bling to his new assignment, glad 
to actually get started before some- 
thing happened to upset the unex- 
pected simplicity of the whole 
thing. There’d never been a mission 
that had come off as smoothly as 
this one was beginning. It promised 
to make them feel guilty to draw 
their pay checks for it. For once, 
it looked as though Joel was going 
to get what he came after without 
having to fight down to raw nerve 
and bone to get it. Good. The Cap- 
tain had an easy one coming. 

When they’d gone, Joel dropped 
his great frame into the ancient 
chair behind his big desk and got 
to work with the ship’s intercom, 
flipping it to main circuit. He did 
ten minutes’ talking in six, and 
Phase One was organized, down to 
the last ship’s guard, down to the 

FOX B. HOLDEN 




last assistant servomech. 

Then he had fourteen minutes 
until Carruthers was due, ready to 
drive him to meet these people in 
their cultivated forest. 

So for every one of the fourteen 
minutes, Captain Nicholas Joel 
leaned back in the chair, shut his 
eyes tight, and filled in a little more 
of the world he wanted. 



T HE ROADS were of hard- 
packed dirt, but level, and wide. 
Occasionally, as Sam Carruthers 
drove, they would pass through a 
hamlet, or go by small knots of men 
and women in carriages and wag- 
ons drawn by striped animals re- 
sembling Earth’s African zebra. The 
farms were small but numerous, 
and none, Joel noted, had been 
entirely cleared; the trees had been 
thinned, and they were of a far 
more slender variety than grew else- 
where, but they had not been elimi- 
nated. It set well with him. Joel had 
always liked trees, and he had a 
feeling he was going to like other 
people who did to such an obvious 
. extent. 

Buildings, he noted, were almost 
entirely of wood; structures very 
similar to those he remembered 
having seen in a history text deal- 
ing with the western United States 
in the nineteenth century. A few 
were of stone, some of small, brick 
cubes; all were pleasing enough to 
the eye. And the people themselves 
were — 

The people looked up as the jeep 
roared past; looked up from their 
work in the fields, looked out from 
their wagons and carriages, looked 
from their saddled mounts at the 
roadside. But there was no fear in 



their glances, only the quick puzzle- 
ment of inquiring intelligence. 

They were straight, well-bodied 
people, clothed simply in colorful 
garments which Joel assumed were 
made of cloth; the men were tall 
and broad and he could mentally 
picture the powerful muscles that 
rippled beneath their shirts. And 
the women — The women were the 
most graceful creatures he had ever 
seen, even those who were obviously 
no longer young; they were less 
fully clad than their men, and Cap- 
tain Nicholas Joel liked that. 

He liked it because it was honest. 
Where there was something beauti- 
ful, why in the name of anything 
holy or otherwise should it be cov- 
ered up? That was the trouble with 
Earth and her people. There were 
too few things of real beauty, and 
when they did exist, humans 
seemed to have a psychotic com- 
pulsion for either ignoring them or 
hiding them completely. And those 
who did hesitate for a stolen mo- 
ment’s admiration were hurriedly 
hollered back to their jobs. 

“You’re surprised that they’re not 
cluttering up the roads, trying to 
get a closer look at us?” Sam was 
hollering over the howl of the 
warm, oxygen-rich atmosphere. 

“Good discipline,” Joel grunted, 
still occupied with his own 
thoughts. 

“Well, you’re partly right. But 
more than that, we haven’t stopped 
to look at them! It’s sort of a half- 
courtesy, half-pride they have. They 
won’t slow a stranger down if he 
doesn’t slow them down, figuring 
that if he wanted to, he would; the 
prerogative is his. And, if he’s not 
that interested, then neither are 
they!” 



TASK MISSION

“You’re sure some expedition 
didn’t get here before we did?” Joel 
asked. “I mean — hell, they could 
be from Earth — ” 

“Ever hear of an Earthman with 
two hearts, skipper? But physically 
that’s about the only difference I 
could find. Psychologically — ” The 
Space surgeon hesitated. 
“Psychologically what?” 

“Take too long to explain — 
we’re coming into the capital city 
you were talking about. And be- 
sides — ” he grinned in a sidelong 
glance at Joel, “you might even 
have the brains to figure it out all 
by yourself.” 

“Go to hell!” 

In a moment Carruthers was 
busy with the jeep, tooling it 
through narrowing streets, slowing 
it to almost a walk as men and 
women hastened out of their way, 
crowded the board sidewalks to 
allow them to pass unhampered. 
The buildings were much like those 
he had seen in the rural districts; a 
little larger, a bit taller, but none 
more than fifty feet in height. 
Neatly painted, their thin glass win- 
dows bright and clean, they did not 
look like part of a city at all, Joel 
reflected, much less part of a capital 
city. And everything was so quiet. 

Maybe too quiet. He felt a little 
chill at the base of his spine, but 
kept looking straight ahead. 

“You’re sure, Sam, about leaving 
my guns back at the ship?” 

Carruthers just grinned again. 
And then they turned abruptly, and 
hauled up in front of a long, low 
building of flagstone. 

“This is it,” the surgeon said. 
“No reporters, no photographers, no 
autograph seekers, no brass band or 
politicians. But you’re on. Skipper.”

C APTAIN Nicholas Joel felt 
naked without his guns, and he 
felt off-balance and out of place. 
Standing in the sedate, oval-shaped 
council-chamber with these peace- 
ful-looking people confronting him, 
he felt clumsy in his heavy black 
leatheroid uniform, big, highly- 
polished black boots. He felt as if 
he looked like what he’d been forced 
to be on other occasions, facing 
forms of life so alien that no dif- 
ference counted — like a man-at- 
arms, like a conqueror. 

Suddenly, he was glad Sam had 
made him leave his guns back at 
the ship. 

“Nicholas Joel, United Americas 
Intergalactic Exploration Fleet, of 
the Ship White Whale, command- 
ing!” Carruthers was introducing 
him in English, and he wished that 
Sam would have had the good sense 
to have said “This is Captain Joel” 
and let it go at that. Didn’t the 
grinning idiot know it must have 
been an awful pill for these people 
to swallow all at once? That there 
were, to begin with, such things as 
other planets and other galaxies — 
and that there were, even more in- 
credibly, other creatures that lived 
on them. And, whether they cared 
to believe it or not, some of these 
creatures had just landed among 
them, and there was nothing they 
could do about it! 

Sam was picking his way along 
now in their speech, and then at an 
obvious gesture, Joel knew he was 
being introduced to their top man. 
Sam waved an arm toward the tall- 
est of the twelve-man group, who 
arose from the opposite side of a 
polished wooden table, and bowed 
gently from the waist. 

“His Excellency and Prime Gov- 

FOX B. HOLDEN 




emor, K’hall-ik’hall.” 

Joel hesitated, then returned the 
bow. He had never bowed in his 
life, but a salute to somebody 
dressed in civilian clothes seemed 
crazy. 

“Sam, you mean he’s Prime Gov- 
ernor of — ” 

“The whole planet.” 

“Am I always supposed to say 
his name twice?” 

“That is his name. That’s the 
way they do it. Now shut up, Skip- 
per, and let me do the talking. I’m 
going to go through the whole works 
again with ’em. Then we sign. Then 
you get a tour of the town so the 
people can be introduced to you 
officially. But don’t go making any 
speeches! Behave, and we’re in 
business.” 

“You go to—” 

But Sam had already started 
talking in the liquid-sounding lan- 
guage, and Joel decided it was bet- 
ter for him to keep his own mouth 
shut and be thought stupid than 
open it and remove all doubt. 
Damn it, the whole thing was mak- 
ing him feel just the way he had 
twenty years ago, when he landed 
his first explorer on an alien world! 
It had been that long, and how 
many hundred meetings with alien 
life-forms since then, under how 
many fantastic circumstances, on 
how many God-forsaken, unworldly 
places? By now he was supposed to 
know the score. By now he was sup- 
posed to have seen everything. By 
now he knew the book inside and 
out, and had the ability to take 
charge no matter where in the 
black universe they sent him. Nich- 
olas Joel, United Americas Inter- 
galactic Exploration Fleet, of the 
Ship White Whale , command-

ing . 

But nobody was challenging his 
right to have what he’d come for! 

No trouble , that was the hell of 
it, and — and there was nothing to 
hate. 

For a miserable moment, Cap- 
tain Nicholas Joel stood becalmed, 
with not so much as a breeze in his 
sagging sails. 

But he would not let them know 
it. He looked levelly into the eyes 
of each of the twelve, but even 
that did little to make him feel 
more at ease. 

For he saw wisdom in the lined, 
kindly faces. He saw a humility and 
sincerity that matched the simple 
clothing they wore. He saw a kind- 
ness that men talked about in books 
and sometimes felt in their hearts, 
but seldom held openly in their 
faces for the world to see. These 
men were handsome in their phys- 
ical stature, but they could have 
been little men three feet high, and 
they would have been the biggest 
that Joel had ever seen. 

Now they were talking in sub- 
dued tones to Sam, and then one 
produced a document, and handed 
Sam a slender writing stylus. 

“Hey Sam — ” The hoarseness 
of his voice unnerved him, but Joel 
plowed ahead. “Hadn’t you 
oughtta read that thing?” 

“It’s already been read, Skipper. 
By Dobermann. It took him three 
days to draw it up — he did most of 
the writing himself. It’s already 
been electrostated ; we’ve got ten 
copies of our own. Now keep your 
mouth shut or they’ll think we 
don’t trust them. You sign first, be- 
cause you’re the guest. Then 
K’hall-i-k’hall, and it’s all over.” 

Sam’s thin face had a seriousness 

49 




in it that Joel knew he did not dare 
question. The trouble is, the thought 
stung him, you doubt, because you 
were born and raised on Earth . Sam 
knows that. And he knows how 
these people think. And he says 
sign . So sign, you big boob . 

Silently, Joel took the stylus from 
Sam, bent quickly over the pap- 
yrus-like document, and put his 
name, rank and ship where Sam 
pointed. Then he gave the stylus to 
Sam, who returned it to K’hall-i- 
k’hall. And in another instant, all 
the mneurium-4 the White Whale 
could lift clear was theirs for the 
taking. 

O NCE HE’D put his mind to it, 
Joel could converse in the lan- 
guage of his hosts as fluently as 
either Dobermann or Carruthers, 
and within a month he had been 
able to finish a limited round of 
visits to a full dozen of the smaller 
cities and towns. These people had 
respected his wish that he be al- 
lowed to roam their streets and 
public buildings without official es- 
cort, and with an ever-quickening 
fading of his self-consciousness, he 
did. 

He did, more and more fre- 
quently. 

And from the vantage point of 
their peacefully winding roads or 
their quaint little shops where they 
dispensed a fluid amazingly sim- 
ilar to Martian Colony Bond, Joel 
could hate the White Whale from 
a comfortable distance, and with a 
healthy, untiring diligence. This he 
also did, more and more frequently. 

It was during one of these self- 
assigned off-duty periods, alone in 
his personal jeep, that his most re- 

50 



cent pint of Bond decided to harass 
him, and he discovered almost too 
late that he had ignored a turn of 
the dirt roadway. He skidded wick- 
edly, and frightened one of the 
zebra-like animals drawing a ve- 
hicle much resembling a four- 
wheeled surrey. The animal let go 
with a terrified whinny, and with 
a sickening splintering noise, the 
dhennah went plunging off the 
road into the deep drainage ditch 
at its edge. There was also another 
sound, and Joel practically stood 
the jeep on its nose slewing it to a 
stop. 

By the time he was out and run- 
ning back, the frightened animal 
had gotten itself out of the ditch 
and was working frantically to 
bring the dhennah out after it. But 
the vehicle was canted at a crazy 
angle, and it was obvious to Joel 
that at least one of its starboard 
wheels was broken, and that it 
would take more than one kaelli to 
haul it out. 

None of this, he reflected as he 
ran, was going to help diplomatic 
relations a bit. And he was no Do- 
bermann. But it was none of these 
things that worried him at the mo- 
ment. 

She was screaming bloody mur- 
der, and still was hard at it when 
he jumped into the ditch. 

She stopped when he clambered 
up on the steeply tilted narrow 
seat to which she clung. There was 
suddenly not a sound from her as 
his big hands circled her waist and 
gently lifted her to the ground. 

Then he discovered that his voice 
was stuck. Dammit, an explorer 
captain for over fifteen years, and 
he didn’t know what to say when 
he banged up some farm girl’s 

FOX B. HOLDEN 




dhennah! 

“I — ah, am terribly sorry. It will 
be replaced, of course. Very stupid 
and clumsy of me. I — ah, you 
hurt?” Rather smooth, at that! 

She smiled. Slender lips, golden- 
colored eyes, delicately contoured 
face — all seemed to smile together. 
A breeze ruffled her tawny mass of 
shoulder-length hair, and Nicholas 
Joel just stood there. 

“You are forgiven, the dhennah 
was not a costly one. I know how 
difficult it must be for you to guide 
those machines of yours at such 
terrible speeds . but of course 
the speeds are necessary to you in 
your work. Thank you for helping 
me.” 

Joel reassured himself that if only 
the conversation were in his mother 
tongue, he would of course not feel 
so ridiculously at a loss for words. 
After all, this young female was 
only an — an alien being. 

“It was my pleasure, of course,” 
Joel said. He thought perhaps if he 
could manage a smile — “I am grat- 
ified that you accept my clumsiness 
with such excellent grace. As in- 
truders to begin with, my men and 
I—” 

“Intruders, sir?” She had taken 
a few steps away from him to stroke 
the neck of the kaelli and quiet it, 
but she was still looking at him. 
“Why intruders? At one time, all 
the people of this world were not of 
one great community as they are 
now, surely you know that. But 
when one group travelled and vis- 
ited another, no one thought of it 
as an intrusion.” She laughed. “Are 
we all not one under the sun?” 

“But they were of your own 
kind, from elsewhere on your own 
planet — ” 

TASK MISSION 



“A visitor is a visitor,” she said, 
as though suddenly puzzled. “What 
can it matter where he is from?” 
Joel started to reply, but checked 
himself. Of course these people 
had no way of knowing. Of course 
they were still under the impression 
that intelligent life, wherever it 
might exist, would necessarily be in 
their own form. The fact that it 
might not be had never occurred to 
them! Then that was why they had 
not feared the White Whale and her 
crew. It was something Carruthers 
had probably perceived at once, 
something he could no doubt ex- 
plain. But now Joel was seeing it 
first-hand for himself. Psycholog- 
ically, this girl and her people were 
incapable of conceiving a way of 
life based on different reasons for 
living than their own, with differ- 
ent motives, different — ambitions. 

Just, he reflected, as his own 
people were psychologically inca- 
pable of greeting a stranger with- 
out subconscious suspicion. 

To these people, a visitor was — 
a visitor, and therefore a friend! 

He wondered how many others 
beside himself, Carruthers and Do- 
bermann knew. 

“Perhaps it does not matter at 
all,” Joel said, and he was surprised 
at the gentleness in his voice. He 
had not felt it that way in his 
throat for a long time. Not for a 
terribly long time. “Now, if you’ll 
let me help you with that harness, 
we’ll free your kaelli , and see what 
can be done about getting you on 
toward your destination!” 

Joel’s big fingers started fum- 
bling with the thick leather thongs 
of the kaelli’s rig. The harness felt 
strange and confusing to hands dis- 
ciplined to the limiting exactnesses 

51 




of servocircuits and pressure-con- 
trol studs, and the complexity of 
their co-ordination was thrown into 
confusion by sheer simplicity. 

The girl laughed as she watched 
his efforts, then guided his hands 
with her own, and Joel felt a strange 
warmth mounting in his neck. And 
when the kaelli was at last freed, 
he said, “Now then,* where can 
I take you? I owe you something 
more than just the replacement of 
your dhennah. I shall drive slowly 
so that the kaelli can follow, and 
you can see for yourself what it is 
like to ride in one of our ma- 
chines!” 

“But — they go like the wind!” 

“Indeed they do!” Joel laughed, 
unaccountably pleased with her ex- 
citement. “Yes, ma’m, just like the 
wind!” 

Quite unexpectedly, she reached 
for his hand, and Joel clasped hers 
with a quickness he had not in- 
tended. But then he was leading her 
to the jeep, helping her into it. 

He started the powerful turbine 
engine, chuckled aloud at her quick 
gasp, then joined in her laughter. 

“Just like the wind!” he cried 
and they were off. 

The day was clear and bright 
and to Joel the air itself seemed to 
come alive with a heady excite- 
ment. This was something, it told 
him. This was not to hate. This was 
not to drink in bitterness. This was 
not to be alone. 



C APTAIN Nicholas Joel paced 
the fore-waist bridge. There was 
a full, untouched flagon on the ma- 
hogany desk, and the bottle of Mar- 
tian Colony Bond stood, tightly 
corked, beside it. 

52 



He sat down, hating the feel of 
the chair of command beneath his 
big body. 

What he was thinking was wrong, 
of course. But no man could be two 
men; a man could not split himself 
down the middle and say: this is 
your life here, this is your life there , 
for it is unthinkable that a man be 
prisoner of one life only — No, a 
man could not do that ; a man had 
only one life. 

Wrong, was it? 

And who, any more a man than 
himself, could dare to be judge? 

He would call Carruthers ; he 
would explain, and Carruthers 
would inform the rest. As for Com- 
mand — 

A buzzer roared on the desk in 
front of him. It was the dispatch 
unit communicator — it would be 
Southard. 

A huge forefinger hit the toggle 
almost hard enough to wrench it 
from its socket 

“Command!” Joel grated into 
the sensitive pick-up. “Proceed with 
your message.” He reached for the 
flagon, drained it, filled it again. 

“Lieutenant Southard calls Com- 
mand from Servogroup 4.” The 
youngster’s voice sounded tight, ex- 
cited. Now what the hell — “Re- 
quest task mission. Request task 
mission. Position — ” 

Joel quickly jacked in the ship’s 
armory circuit. An alarm klaxon 
would be electrifying the entire 
complement of combat personnel 
stationed in that quarter of the ship 
even as armory communications 
was taking down the co-ordinates 
Southard was dictating. And with- 
in one minute and forty-five seconds 
after that, combat units would be 
assembling in machine-like preci- 

FOX B. HOLDEN 




sion, deploying into advance order 
at the ship’s stern. 

And as the two huge sections 
between the White Whale’s slender 
atmosphere fins opened like hun- 
gry steel mouths, disgorging flat, 
thick-bodied machines with their 
grim burdens of armed men and 
destroyer-artillery. Ship’s Guard 
would be taking up defense posi- 
tions, manning gun stations which 
commanded an energy potential 
sufficient to destroy a minor planet 
in a single, searing second of blue- 
white heat. 

All this was automatic. A dis- 
patch-unit request for task mission 
was an order, momentarily trans- 
cending even Command authority. 
It worked that way because the 
men who travelled space had 
learned that with the first foot they 
rose off the surface of Earth, theirs 
was no longer the privilege of liv- 
ing, but the task of survival. Space 
was emergency. And if you re- 
garded it otherwise, it would kill 
you. 

Joel waited. He watched only the 
sweep second hand on his desk 
chronometer; he did not need his 
screens, for he knew too well what 
was transpiring three hundred and 
twelve feet below him. He had 
seen it too many times. And too 
many times had he waited the ne- 
cessary two minutes, listened to the 
taut silence of the waiting com- 
municator. 

“Command to Southard. Task 
mission dispatched and advancing. 
Now describe your situation.” 

“As follows — ” The young lieu- 
tenant’s voice was still taut, but it 
was not at the edge of panic. Of 
that Joel was certain. It was just 
that this was the first time, and it 

TASK MISSION 



wasn’t a field exercise, and it hadn’t 
just been learned the night before 
from an Academy manual . 

“Servounit 4, sample tapping 
with four facilities at two hundred 
feet. Metal encountered; processed. 
Object depth-screened; fabricated. 
Extends from minus two zero zero 
to minus five two seven. Diameter 
three zero feet. Further investiga- 
tion withheld pending arrival of 
task mission. Over for Command.” 
Over for Command, the young 
voice said. So many, many times . 

He was not exactly the same 
Nicholas Joel, now. He was Com- 
mand . 

“All right, boy, sit easy and try 
to relax. What the hell is it you’ve 
got holed up out there?” 

“It’s a — a space ship, sir.” 
“What class?” 

“I don’t know, sir. It isn’t Ter- 
restrial.” 

“All right, what do the counters 
tell you?” 

“It’s about a thousand years old, 
sir. That’s as close as the counters 
can come, working off a screen. 
Perhaps, sir, you’d — ” 

“Well I don’t want to look at pic- 
tures! Inform task mission when 
they show up that I’m coming out 
for a look around — and I’ll have 
their hides if they go unnailing 
things before I get there. You got 
any Bond with you, Southard?” 
“Yes sir.” 

“All right, you get my point? 
Don’t drink it all! This is Com- 
mand, Whale, out!” 

Joel broke the circuit just as the 
admittance buzzer went off ; he 
thumbed a stud and the narrow 
bulkhead door slid back, admitting 
Carruthers and Dobermann. 

“Was wondering when you two 

53 




were going to report. Sent a T-M 
to Southard — says he’s found a 
space ship two hundred feet under 
the desert. Sometimes I think that 
kid works too hard. All right, got 
the ’copter ready?” 

“Warming up on the waist ramp 
now,” Dobermann said. 

Joel stood up, reached for his 
guns and belt and strapped them 
around his thick middle. He gave 
Carruthers a quick look. The thin 
face was taut, almost expression- 
less, but there was an excitement 
smouldering in the dark eyes; the 
old excitement Joel had seen in 
them so many times before. 

“No objections to the artillery 
this time, I take it, Sam?” Joel 
grunted as he clasped the big 
buckle, let the weight of the blast- 
ers sag their holsters down into po- 
sition on his thighs. “Damn good 
of you! And I’m glad you under- 
stand these people so well — while 
we’re on our way maybe you can 
tell me why they bury space ships.” 
“Maybe we ought to ask them, 
Skipper,” Sam said with a half- 
smile on his thin lips. 

“I get your point. But maybe 
they should’ve told us! Come on.” 



O N JOEL’S order, the task mis- 
sion’s guns had been reversed; 
drawn about the area where South- 
ard’s servounits were noisily suck- 
ing up sand, they no longer were 
concentrated on the excavation 
site, but instead defended it, slender 
snouts commanding an immense 
circular field of fire. 

“You don’t trust them at that, 
do you, Nicholas?” Carruthers said 
above the racket of the servounits. 
“Lord, you could slaughter an 

54 



army — ” 

“This is what it says to do in the 
goddamn books!” Joel snapped. 
“You’re the guys who were so glad 
to make a strike.” 

The heavy, tracked machinery 
with its towering drill-housings and 
down-thrust vacuum-scoops whined 
and growled in a nerve-wrenching 
discord of power. Men sweated 
under the mild sun with a silent 
hurry, with a disciplined excite- 
ment. 

Southard was fast and efficient. 

Dobermann was silent, watching, 
analyzing. 

Carruthers had the hungry look 
in his eyes that Joel did not under- 
stand. 

And Joel was impatient. It was 
a tableau of men and machines that 
he had watched before, and always, 
at the end of it, there was some- 
thing big for him to handle — frus- 
trating if not dangerous, a mind 
and bone-wearying struggle if not 
an outright battle. They never came 
smooth, never. 

“Forehull clear, sir!” It was 
Southard, calling from the lip of 
the immense hole his machines had 
excavated. 

“Cut your servos!” 

Southard signalled to his units, 
and they muttered slowly into si- 
lence, and then the silence hung 
over them all like a heavy thing, and 
Captain Nicholas Joel knew that 
what happened next was up to him. 

With a motion of one gauntleted 
hand he brought Dobermann and 
Carruthers in next to him, and 
then the three of them walked with 
a disciplined haste to the sandy lip, 
past Southard, and looked down. 

A pitted forehull jutted up out 
of the moist sand two hundred feet 



FOX B. HOLDEN 




below them, its plates glittering 
darkly in the rays of the powerful 
illumination units which had al- 
ready been lowered. 

Dobermann’ s quick eyes took in 
each detail in seconds, and then 
they darted up to Joel’s face. Car- 
ruthers was silent, and his face was 
white. 

“All right, let’s get some winch- 
lifts over here!” Joel bellowed. 
“Torches, can-openers, let’s get with 
it!” 

And within minutes, Joel was on 
his way down in a bucket, big boots 
planted solidly on a small moun- 
tain of heavy tools. 

Dobermann was following, and 
Carruthers was in the third bucket. 

Joel’s bare hands were exploring 
the gnurled lip of the fore-hull 
lock-hatch before either of them 
hit bottom. Dobermann was first 
up beside him, a heavy torch 
cradled in his short, thick arms. 

“Ready?” 

“Won’t need that thing,” Joel 
grunted. “Nobody locked up when 
they left. Give me a hand.” 

The hatch, like the rest of the 
hull, was pitted, but despite 
the moistness of the sand in which 
the ship was imbedded, there were 
no indications of corrosion. Joel 
made a mental note to have the lu- 
bricants in which the hinge- 
gymbals were packed analyzed 
later; they were still as good as 
new; the hatch was giving almost 
easily. 

Carruthers, with an arc lantern, 
lit their way inside. 

They walked into what was ob- 
viously a pilots’ compartment. In- 
struments, control panels, ack-seats, 
notations on metal-leaf note-pads 
which they did not understand; 

TASK MISSION 



Dobermann copied them. 

They descended ladder - walks 
into the fore- waist; crew compart- 
ment. Functional, compact, reflect- 
ing the same efficient engineering 
which they had encountered in the 
previous compartment. 

Through a second bulkhead 
opening; supply compartment. 
Through another; cargo hold. It 
was not empty, and loading gear 
was in evidence, although neatly 
stowed in its locks. 

“Mneurium-4,” Carruthers said. 
The words made a hollow sound in 
the emptiness behind them. 

They kept going. Armory. All 
units still in place. Engine room. 
Dobermann’s counter ticked slowly 
in the stillness. Still a little kick left 
in the piles. Machine-shop ; lab. 
Spotless, perfect order. Finally, 
tubes. The smooth metal gleamed in 
the light of Carruthers’ lamp. 

And that was all. 

Joel turned wordlessly and started 
back up the ladder-walks. Dober- 
mann and Carruthers clanged 
hollowly after him, scrambling to 
keep up. 

Joel didn’t stop until he had 
climbed back into one of the 
buckets, and then he waved im- 
patiently. Machinery whined above 
him, and his bucket swung clear. 

At the lip, he motioned for South- 
ard. 

“All right, I want ten of your 
people with technical research 
rates. Leave them with Dobermann 
and Carruthers. Issue return orders 
to your T-M, and then get these 
units out of here and digging up 
what we came after.” 

“But — yes sir.” 

Dobermann and Carruthers were 
at the lip, climbing out of their 

55 




buckets. There was a puzzzled look, 
even on Dobermann’s usually tac- 
iturn face. 

“You two,” Joel snapped, “will 
have a crew of researchers. Ten 
men. Take twenty-four hours and 
scrape the insides of this thing. Car- 
ruthers will report directly to me 
when you’re finished. Dobermann, 
you’ll nail K’hall-i-k’hall to a wall 
somewhere and don’t let him down 
until you find out what became of 
whoever flew this tank.” 

He turned and walked away be- 
fore anyone could protest. 

C APTAIN Nicholas Joel drained 
the flagon. He looked again at 
the faded image in the small, rec- 
tangular frame, finally returned it 
to the breast pocket of his tunic. 
Then he looked up across the ma- 
hogany desk at Carruthers and 
Dobermann. 

“So,” he said slowly, “so he told 
you he didn’t know, did he?” 

“Yes, Captain, that is what he 
told me. He was surprised about 
the space ship. He called the others 
in. There was the same reaction. 
They—” 

Joel leaped to his feet. “Don’t 
give me that!” he thundered. He 
grabbed at the bottle of Bond; 
spilled it as he poured. “You know 
he knows!” 

“Captain, I was quite con- 
vinced.” 

“Quite convinced, quite con- 
vinced, were you . All right, Do- 
bermann, get out of here. You find 
out anything, let me know. Sam, 
I want to talk to you. Go on Dober- 
mann, git!” 

Joel slumped back behind the 
desk as his first officer pivoted, left. 



He tried a swallow from the flagon ; 
fumbled at his tunic pocket for the 
small frame, extracted it; looked at 
it again. Then put it back a second 
time. 

Carruthers sat down opposite 
him. 

“You going to talk to me, Nich- 
olas, or pass out before you get the 
chance?” 

“All right, Sam.” Joel got up, 
put the Bond back in its cabinet; 
emptied the flagon and put it in too. 
“I get your point. Only you listen. 
The crew of that ship was delib- 
erately murdered. Cold-bloodedly 
murdered, and it isn’t going to 
happen to us.” 

“I see.” The ship’s surgeon eyed 
the tips of his fingernails, then 
slowly looked up into Joel’s red, 
swollen face. “Naturally, there 
wouldn’t be any bodies around to 
prove your theory, would there, 
skipper? And no signs of struggle. 
We didn’t see any. Of course, their 
guns were racked up pretty neatly 
— But it’s all there in the report — ” 
he waved a slender hand toward a 
roll of tape on the desk. 

“Never mind your sarcastic 
technicalities! They were — ” 

“Nicholas, sit down. And listen.” 

“All right. But I don't get your 
point! And I don’t want any of 
your double-talk! The trouble with 
you guys — ” 

“First of all, Nicholas, you know 
that crew wasn’t murdered or any- 
thing of the kind. And you know, 
and Dobermann realizes that you 
know he knows, that K’hall-i-k’hall 
was lying in his teeth. And K’hall-i- 
k’hall knows we know it.” 

Joel lowered his eyes. “All right, 
Sam,” he said. No, there hadn’t 
been any use in trying to drum up 

FOX B. HOLDEN 



56 




a bunch of tripe — no use in trying 
to fool Sam. He had known that 
from the start. But sometimes — 
sometimes, even when a man knew 
he was fooling himself, he had to 
give it a try, just to see — “They 
went native, didn’t they, Sam?” 
he said. 

“Yes, Skipper. They did. Some- 
body back where they came from 
needed that mneurium-4 real bad. 
Somebody had guts and sweat and 
brains enough to get ships into 
space looking for it. And in their 
own way, somebody had faith 
enough to think they’d get it if it 
was to be found. Only, as you 
say — ” 

“Liked it here, I suppose. Liked 
it better than anything they’d ever 
seen before — and that can of theirs 
had a thumping set of drives, so 
they’d seen plenty.” 

There was silence for a moment. 
And then Sam said, “Well, Nicho- 
las, there it is. The psychology of 
the thing is obvious enough, isn’t 
it?” Carruthers gave him a mean- 
ingful look, and Joel’s nerves re- 
belled at it. 

“All right, I get your point!” A 
big fist slammed down on the desk- 
top. “So somebody didn’t get their 
mneurium-4! Somebody probably 
ornery enough to keep on living 
anyway. What do you want to bet 
they’re still going strong, who or 
wherever they are out in that black 
hell up there? What do you want 
to bet, Sam?” 

The surgeon’s thin lips smiled 
gently. “I’d bet right along with 
you, Nicholas. They’re probably 
still going strong. I imagine they 
made out.” 

“But K’hall-i-k’hall — ” 

“Is proprietor of a very pleasant 

TASK MISSION 



world. A world of very nice people, 
Nicholas, who enjoy living in, their 
way, and get a kick out of seeing 
other people enjoy it. They think a 
little differently than a lot of 
folks.” 

“That makes ’em bad, I sup- 
pose?” 

“No.” 

Joel looked into the thin face, 
the intent, dark eyes. The look was 
in them. 

And Joel guessed he was finally 
letting himself realize what the look 
really meant. 

It was a look that meant a hun- 
ger for all that Joel hated, and 
more. 

It was a look that meant, even 
now after all these years, that Sam 
still hurt inside, and hurt badly. 

“Why — why couldn’t it have 
been the other way around , Sam,” 
Joel said hoarsely. 

The other looked up at him. 
“You do hate it that much, don’t 
you.” 

“Look Sam, you’ve gotta get my 
point! I don’t think that crew did 
anything wrong! They didn’t. They 
just decided to stop being hunks of 
machinery.” 

Carruthers smiled. “I get your 
point. Skipper. And I’m going to 
let you figure this one out all by 
yourself. But I’d like to tell you 
something first, just sort of as a 
point of information; maybe it’ll 
help. Skipper, I had a girl once, 
too.” 

Joel stood still. Then he turned, 
opened his mouth to speak, then 
clamped it hard shut. 

“They told me I couldn’t pilot. 
But I could help, and my help was 
needed — everybody’s was, because 
this wasn’t a matter of a govem- 

57 




ment project. This was a matter of 
a race of people who were building 
a ladder — a big, tall ladder, Nicho- 
las. Sometimes it was a killer. 
Sometimes a heartbreaker. Some- 
times a laughingstock. But it be- 
longed to men , and they lived and 
died for it; they built it , and it’s 
theirs to climb , Nicholas!” 

Joel watched the other’s worn 
face, and now the hurt was naked 
in it. 

“She said, Nicholas, that it was 
all off if I decided to go up to 
space. I loved her, Skipper. And 1 
loved the tall ladder” 

Joel whirled. “Sure, and what’s 
it got us, Sam? A bellyful of cold, 
aching loneliness — our guts twisted 
and squeezed until the life’s dried 
up in ’em — and what do we get? 
What do those wrangling, yapping, 
bellyaching rotters back home give 
us for it? Pension us off when we 
can’t see our blast-off studs any- 
more and forget about us. 

“They take the stuff we bring 
’em — just as if it grew on trees, 
just as if it grew into a neat, pretty 
package somewhere all by itself! 
With money they can buy it — with 
enough money they can buy all of 
it! Even if we had to get it with the 
air sucked out of us, with our 
brains boiled out of us, with our 
crazy heads busted in. 

“And you know what, Sam? 
There was even a time when they 
said we couldn’t do it at all! A hun- 
dred years ago, they laughed at us 
for trying to get to the moon! They 
laughed, Sam — and those who 
didn’t laugh didn’t even give a 
damn at all! 

“So I was to tell the girl I’d 
marry her later, but that right now 
they thought I ought to be a pilot! 

58 



I was to say to my life : I’ll live you 
later, but right now I’ve got to be a 
.pilot. And I was to freeze my 
insides for twenty years showing 
’em they were wrong to laugh, and 
that it was time they gave a damn, 
that what I could bring home was 
going to mean a lot to the world 
they live on! 

“And like a fool I did! 

“And Sam — Sam, they’re still 
yapping like little dogs for a piece 
of meat — not just a good piece of 
meat, but all wrapped up nice and 
fancy, no mistakes allowed, every 
time they whistle! And the whis- 
tling gets so easy, Sam — so easy. 
You can even do it while you’re 
stabbing your neighbor in the back, 
while you’re selling his kids down 
the river — even while you’re taking 
your next breath to yap some 
more! 

“They can go to hell, Sam! 
They can go to hell.” 

Joel slumped down in the chair 
behind the mahogany desk. 

The surgeon looked at him, 
looked away. 

“You’ve made up your mind, 
then.” 

“That’s right.” 

“I suppose Dobermann and I 
can get the ship back somehow.” 

“You’ll make it.” 

“I guess we will. Unless the 
rest feel the way you do — and I 
know half the crew thinks this is 
quite a place. In which case, of 
course, I suppose they’ll survive, 
back home, even without the 
mneurium-4 — they have for a long 
time. But there is one thing.” 

“Yeah, yeah.” 

“These people are fine people, as 
you’ve — found out. You couldn’t 
even replace that dhennah ” 

FOX B. HOLDEN 




“How did you — ” 

“They’re swell folks, Nicholas, 
and always will be,” the surgeon 
said softly, “and they’ve never built 
a thing, and never will. 

“They don’t know greed, be- 
cause no one has ever achieved 
anything worth another’s wanting. 

“They don’t know jealousy, be- 
cause no one has ever obtained 
anything that another couldn’t. 

“They don’t know hate, because 
no one has ever discovered a thing 
for which to fight that another 
thinks of sufficient value to fight 
for. 

“Only — if they don’t know hate 
or jealousy, Skipper — then, they 
don 3 t know love ! 33 

Quietly, Carruthers rose from his 
chair. For a moment, he hesitated. 
“What is it you’re lonely for, 
Nicholas?” he asked, and then he 
left the fore-waist bridge. 

T HERE WAS a mushroom of 
sun-fire against the blackness 
of the cool night, and a thunder 
of power. 

Slowly, ponderously, the White 
Whale backed down her column of 
flame, hesitated, flared again for a 
final time from her thick stem, and 
then settled to Earth. 



Gantries rolled into position. 
And the sound of lock-hatches 
clanging open thrilled the length of 
the White Whale , and there were 
the muffled voices of men, and the 
voices became shouts with the joy 
loud in them. 

The men trooped down from 
their great metal monster as fast as 
the lifts would carry them, and in 
small groups and in crowds they 
made their boistrous way across the 
landing plaza and toward home. 

And when the shouts had died, 
a last man descended the smooth 
sides of the White Whale . 

His eyes glanced over the great 
bulk of her, making certain she was 
secure. Then he, too, walked from 
her, but not as quickly as the rest. 

Captain Nicholas Joel walked 
slowly, because he was tired. 

On every side of him, in dark 
shadow against the night, there 
were tall, slender, streamlined 
shapes pointing toward the stars. 

His slow boot-steps echoed from 
their hulls as he passed, a tiny 
midge of a thing, between them. 

As Sam had said, these were 
things that Man had made. 

And among them again was the 
White Whale . 

They had said he was a good 
pilot. • • •

One Love Have I 

BY ROBERT F. YOUNG 



I T HAD BEEN one of those rural 
suppers, which were being re- 
vived at the time. Philip had just 
arrived in the little academic vil- 
lage that evening and he had just 
finished unpacking his clothes and 
his books. There had been nothing 
more for him to do till morning 
when he was due to report at the 
university, and feeling restless, and 
feeling a little lonely too (as he’d 
admitted to Miranda later), he had 
left the boarding house with the in- 
tention of wandering about the vil- 
lage till he was tired enough to 
sleep. He had hardly gone two 
blocks, however, before he had 
come to the brightly lit community 
hall where the supper was in prog- 
ress, and strangely intrigued, per- 
haps motivated by the stirring of 
some pleasant racial memory, he 
had paused before the entrance. 

Through the wide-flung doors 
he had seen the long table in the 
middle of the floor, and the food- 
laden tables, each with a girl in 
blue behind it, lining the walls. He 
had seen the men and women pass- 



ing the food tables, carrying trays, 
and he had heard the clatter of 
dishes and the reassuring sound 
of homely voices. He had noticed 
the sign above the entrance then, 
and the simplicity of it had touched 
him: 77c COMMUNITY SUP- 
PER-SQUARE DANCE TO 
FOLLOW. It had touched him 
and filled him with a yearning he 
hadn’t experienced since he was 
a boy, and he had climbed the wide 
steps that led to the open doors 
and stepped into the hall. It was 
a warm night in September and the 
curtains at the big windows were 
breathing in a gentle wind. 

He saw her instantly. She was be- 
hind the ham sandwich table on the 
opposite side of the room, tall, dark- 
haired, her face a lovely flower 
above the blue petals of her collar. 
The moment he stepped through 
the doorway she became the cyno- 
sure of the scene, and everything 
else — tables, diners, walls, floor — 
became vague extraneous details 
which an artist adds to a picture to 
accentuate its central subject. 



61 




He was only dimly aware of the 
other people as he walked across 
the room. He was halfway to her 
table, before she looked up and saw 
him. Their eyes touched then, her 
blue ones and his gray; touched and 
blended, achieved a moment apart 
from time. And he had fallen in 
love with her, and she with him, 
and it didn’t matter what the 
Freudian psychologists said about 
that kind of love because the Freud- 
ian psychologists simply didn’t know 
about that kind of love, about the 
way it was to walk into a room and 
see a girl and know instantly, 
without understanding how you 
knew — or caring even — that she, 
and she alone, was the girl for you, 
the girl you wanted and had always 
wanted, would want forever — 

Forever and a day . • . 

His hands were shaking again 
and he made them place a ciga- 
rette between his lips and then he 
made them light it. But when they 
had finished the task and the first 
pale exhalation of smoke was ho- 
vering in the little compartment, 
they were still shaking, and he held 
them tightly together on his lap and 
forced his eyes to look out the win- 
dow of the monorail car at the 
passing countryside. 

The land was a tired green, a 
September green. There was gold- 
enrod on hillsides, and the tips of 
sumac leaves were just beginning 
to redden. The car swayed as the 
overhead rail curved around a hill 
and spanned a valley. It was a 
lovely valley but it wasn’t a famil- 
iar one. However, Philip wasn’t 
perturbed : the car was still too 
far from Cedarville for him to be 
seeing familiar places. He’d never 

62 



been much for traveling and it 
would be some time yet before he 
could start looking for remembered 
hills and forests, valleys, roads, 
houses — Houses sometimes stood 
for a hundred years. Not very often, 
maybe, but once in a while. It 
wasn’t too much to ask. 

He lay his head back on the 
pneumatic head rest and tried to 
relax. That was what the Deep 
Freeze Rehabilitation Director had 
instructed him to do. “Relax. Keep 
your mind empty. Let things enter 
into your awareness gradually, and 
above all don’t think of the past.” 
Relax, Philip thought. Don’t think 
of the past. The past is past, past, 
past . 

The car swayed again and his 
head turned slightly. The monorail 
bordered a spaceport at this point, 
but he had never seen a spaceport 
before and for a moment he 
thought that the car was passing 
through a vast man-made desert. 
Then he saw the lofty metallic tow- 
ers pointing proudly into the after- 
noon sky, and presently he realized 
that they weren’t towers at all, but 
ships instead. 

He stared at them, half fright- 
ened. They were one of the phe- 
nomena of the new era for which 
he was unprepared. There had 
been spaceships in his own era of 
course, but there hadn’t been very 
many of them and they had been 
rather puny affairs, strictly limited 
to interplanetary travel. They bore 
no resemblance to the magnificent 
structures spread out before his 
eyes now. 

The Sweike Drive hadn’t been 
discovered till the year of his trial, 
and he began to realize the effect 
it had had on space travel during 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 




the ensuing century. In a way it 
was not surprising. Certainly the 
stars were a greater incentive to 
man than the lifeless planets of the 
home system ever could have been. 

Alpha Centauri, Sirius, Altair, 
Vega — One of the ships had gone 
as far as Arcturus, the Rehabil- 
itation Director had told him. It 
had returned scarcely six months 
ago after an absence of almost 65 
years. Philip shook his head. It was 
data he could not accept, data too 
fantastic for him to accept. To him 
it belonged in a probability story, 
a story that you read with interest, 
then forget the moment you laid it 
aside. 

He had always considered him- 
self modern. He had always kept 
abreast of his age and , accepted 
change as a part of the destiny of 
man. Scientific progress had never 
dismayed him; rather, it had stim- 
ulated him, and in his chosen field 
of political philosophy he had been 
far ahead of his contemporaries, 
both in vision and in practical appli- 
cation. He had been, in fact, the 
epitome of modern civilized man — 

One hundred years ago . 

Wearily he turned his eyes from 
the window and regarded the gray 
walls of the compartment. He re- 
membered his cigarette when it 
nipped his fingers, and he dropped 
it into the disposal tray. He picked 
up the magazine he had been try- 
ing to read some time before and 
tried to read it again, but his mind 
stumbled over unfamiliar words, 
over outrageous idioms, faltered be- 
fore undreamed-of concepts. The 
magazine slipped from his fingers 
to the seat again and he let it lie 
there. 

He felt like an old, old man, yet, 
ONE LOVE HAVE I 



in a subjective sense he wasn’t old 
at all. Despite the fact that he had 
been born one hundred and twenty- 
seven years ago, he was really only 
twenty-seven. For the years in the 
Deep Freeze didn’t count — a hun- 
dred year term in suspended ani- 
mation was nothing more than a 
wink in subjective time. 

He lay his head back on the head 
rest again. Relax, he told himself. 
Don’t think of the past. The past is 
past past past . Tentatively he 
closed his eyes. The moment he did 
so he knew it had been a mistake, 
but it was too late then, for the 
time stream already had eddied 
back more than a hundred years 
to a swiftly flowing September cur- 
rent . • 

It had been a glorious day for a 
picnic and they had discovered a 
quiet place on a hill above the vil- 
lage. There was a cool spring not 
far away, and above their heads 
an enormous oak spread its 
branches against a lazy autumn 
sky. Miranda had packed liver- 
wurst sandwiches in little pink bags 
and she had made potato salad. 
She spread a linen tablecloth on 
the grass, and they ate facing each 
other, looking into each other’s 
eyes. A light wind gamboled about 
them, left ephemeral footprints on 
the hillside. 

The potato salad had been rather 
flat, but he had eaten two helpings 
so that she wouldn’t suspect that 
he didn’t like it; and he’d also 
eaten two of the liverwurst sand- 
wiches, though he didn’t care for 
liverwurst at all. After they finished 
eating they drank coffee, Miranda 
pouring it from the large picnic 
thermos into paper cups. She had 

63 




been very careful not to spill a 
drop, but she had spilt a whole cup 
instead, on his shirtsleeve. She had 
been contrite and on the verge of 
tears, but he had only loved her all 
the more; because her awkward- 
ness was as much a part of her as 
her dark brown hair, as her blue 
eyes, as her dimples and her smile. 
It softened the firm maturity of 
her young woman’s body, lent her 
movements a school-girlish charm; 
put him at ease in the aura of her 
beauty. For it was reassuring to 
know that so resplendent a god- 
dess as Miranda had human frail- 
ties just as lesser creatures did. 

After the coffee they had re- 
clined in the shade, and Miranda 
had recited “Afternoon on a Hill” 
and Philip had remembered some 
of Rupert Brooke’s “The Old Vic- 
arage, Grantchester”. Miranda was 
in her final year at the university 
— she was twenty-one — and she 
was majoring in English Literature. 
That had put them on common 
ground from the start, for Philip 
had loved literature since the mo- 
ment he had opened Huckleberry 
Finn as a boy, and during the en- 
suing years he had never lost con- 
tact with it. 

He had been affecting a pipe at 
the time (a pipe lent you a desper- 
ately needed dignity when you were 
only twenty-six and commencing 
your first semester of teaching), 
and Miranda had filled it for him, 
holding his lighter over the bowl 
while he puffed the tobacco into 
ruddy life ... It had been such a 
splendid afternoon, such a glorious 
aftemon, filled with September 
wind and September sunshine, with 
soft words and quiet laughter. The 
sun was quite low when they pre- 

64 



pared to leave, and Philip hadn’t 
wanted to leave at all. Miranda had 
seemed reluctant too, folding the 
linen tablecloth slowly, being far 
more meticulous than she usually 
was when she folded things, and 
then picking up the bowl half filled 
with potato salad, intending to set 
it in the picnic basket. She didn’t 
quite make the basket, however, 
for the bowl was large and clumsy 
and she was using only one hand. 
It escaped her fingers somehow, 
and overturned, and his lap was 
just beneath. That had been the 
last time he had ever worn his 
Madagascar slacks. 

Her eyes had become so big and 
so round with dismay that he 
would have laughed if they had 
been anyone else’s eyes besides Mi- 
randa’s. You could never laugh at 
Miranda’s eyes; they were too deep 
and too blue. He had only smiled 
instead, and said it didn’t matter, 
and wiped his slacks with his 
handkerchief. Then he had seen 
her tears, and he had seen her 
standing there helplessly, tall and 
gawky, a child really, a lovely child 
who had become a woman a little 
too soon, and a beautiful woman 
too. And something within him had 
collapsed and a softness had spread 
all through him, and he had taken 
her into his arms and said, “Mir- 
anda, Miranda. Will you marry 
me, Miranda?” 

The spaceport was far behind 
and the car was twisting through 
hills, humming on its overhead rail. 
It skimmed the treetops of a forest 
and passed high above a river. 
Looking down at the river bank, 
Philip saw his first familiar land- 
mark. 



ROBERT F. YOUNG 




It was nothing more than a pile 
of crumbled masonry now, over- 
grown with river weeds and sumac, 
but once, he knew, yesterday or a 
hundred years ago, it had been a 
public villa, and he had spent an 
afternoon on one of its sun splashed 
patios, sipping cocktails and idly 
watching the white flurries of sails 
on the blue water below. And 
thinking of nothing, absolutely 
nothing — 

Except Miranda. 

Desperately he forced her out of 
his mind. It had been all right to 
think of her a century ago. It wasn’t 
now. He couldn’t think of her now 
because thinking of her tore him 
apart; because he had a reality to 
face and if he thought of her the 
way she had been a hundred years 
ago he wouldn’t be able to face it 
— he wouldn’t be able to search for 
her in the Gedarville cemetery and 
put flowers on her grave. 

The Rehabilitation Director had 
told him that in a way his sentence 
had been merciful, merciful by 
accident of course, and not design. 
It would have been far worse, the 
Rehabilitation Director had said, 
for him to have been sentenced for 
only fifty years and then to have 
gone home, a man of twenty-seven, 
to a wife who had just passed 
seventy-two. 

But it was naive to speak of 
mercy, even accidental mercy, in 
connection with the age of the 
Congressional Regime. An age that 
could condemn a man to sus- 
pended animation, tear him forci- 
bly from the moment in time 
where he belonged, to be resur- 
rected decades later into a moment 
in time where he did not belong — 
an age like that had no mercy, had 

ONE LOVE HAVE I 



no conception of the meaning of 
the word. Such an age was brutal, 
or more brutal, or less brutal; but 
it was never merciful. 

And an age like the present one, 
while it had rediscovered mercy, 
was incapable of bestowing it upon 
a resurrected criminal. It could 
apologize to him for the cruelty of 
of the preceding age, and it could 
remunerate him handsomely for 
the lost years, make him independ- 
ent for life; but it could not give 
him back that moment in time that 
was uniquely his own, it could not 
bring back the soft smile and the 
unforgettable laughter of the 
woman he loved. 

It could not obliterate a cem- 
etery lot with a grave that had no 
right to be there, a grave that had 
not been there a subjective yester- 
day ago. It could not erase the 
words “Miranda Lorring, b. 2024, 
d. 20—” or was it “21— ”?— he 
couldn’t know of course, not yet, 
but he hoped she’d lived long and 
happily, and that she’d remarried 
and had children. She had been 
meant to have children. She had 
been too full of love not to have 
had them. 

But if she had remarried, then 
her name wouldn’t be Miranda 
Lorring. It would be Miranda 
something else, Miranda Green, 
perhaps, or Miranda Smith; and 
perhaps she had moved away from 
Cedarville, perhaps he was going 
home for nothing. No, not for noth- 
ing. He’d at least be able to trace 
her from Cedarville, trace her to 
wherever she’d gone to live, find 
her grave and cover it with forget- 
me-nots — forget-me-nots had been 
her favorite flower — and shed a 
tear on some quiet afternoon, her

kiss of a hundred years ago a warm 
memory on his lips. 

He got up in the gently swaying 
compartment and stepped over to 
the water cooler and dialed a 
drink. He had to do something, 
anything at all, to distract his mind. 
And the dial was so simple, so 
child-simple, requiring but the 
flick of his finger, and no thought, 
no attention. It could not interrupt 
the flow of his thoughts even 
briefly, and the cool taste of the 
water only gave the flow impetus, 
sent it churning through his mind, 
wildly, turning his knees weak, 
sending him staggering back to the 
seat, his grief a tight-packed lump 
swelling upward from his chest to 
his throat, and the memories, re- 
leased, flowing freely now, catch- 
ing him up and carrying him back 
to the light days, to the bright glor- 
ious days, back to his finest mo- 
ment — 



T HAD BEEN a simple wedding 
Miranda had worn blue and 
Philip had worn his academic dac- 
rons. The Cedarville justice of the 
peace had performed the cere- 
mony, being very brusque about 
it, saying the words as fast as he 
could and even holding out his 
hand for the fee the moment he 
had finished. But Philip had not 
minded. Nothing seemed ugly to 
him that day, not even the Novem- 
ber rain that began to fall when 
they left the justice’s house, not 
even the fact that he had been un- 
able to obtain leave of absence 
from the university. The wedding 
took place on Friday night and that 
gave them Saturday and Sunday; 
but two days weren’t enough for 

66 



a trip, and they decided to spend 
their honeymoon in the little house 
Philip had bought on Maple 
Street. 

It was an adorable house, Mi- 
randa said for the hundreth time 
when they paused before it in the 
rain. Philip thought so too. It was 
set well back from the street and 
there were two catalpa trees in the 
front yard, one on either side of 
the little walk. There was a tiny 
porch, latticed on each side, and 
a twentieth century paneled door. 

He had carried her over the 
threshold, breathing a little hard, 
for she was quite heavy, and set 
her down in the middle of the liv- 
ing room. All of his books were 
there, on built-in shelves on either 
side of the open fireplace, and Mi- 
randa’s knickknacks covered the 
mantel. The new parlor suite 
matched the mauve-grey curtains. 

She had been shy when he kissed 
her, and he hadn’t known quite 
what to say. Being alone together 
in their own house involved an in- 
timacy for which neither of them 
had been prepared, despite all the 
whispered phrases and stolen kisses, 
the looks passed in the university 
corridors, the afternoons shared, 
and the autumn evenings walking 
together along leaf-strewn streets. 
Finally she had said, “I’ll make 
some coffee,” and had gone into 
the kitchen. The first thing she 
had done was to drop the coffee 
canister, and there was the coffee, 
dark against the gleaming floor, 
and there was Miranda, her blue 
eyes misted, lovely in her blue dress, 
a goddess in the room, his goddess; 
and then a goddess in his arms, 
soft-lipped and pliant, then warm 
and suddenly tight-pressed against 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 




him, her arms about his neck and 
her dark hair soft against his face 



A village showed in the distance, 
between wooded hills. It was a de- 
serted village and it had fallen 
into ruin, but there were remnants 
of remembered buildings still stand- 
ing and Philip recognized it as a 
little town not far from Cedarville. 

He had very few memories as- 
sociated with it, so he experienced 
but little pain. He experienced fear 
instead, for he knew that very soon 
the car would be slowing, that 
shortly he would be stepping down 
to the rotting platform of the Ce- 
darville station. And he knew that 
he would be seeing another deserted 
village, one with many memories, 
and he was afraid that he couldn’t 
endure the sight of remembered 
streets choked with weeds, of be- 
loved houses fallen into decay, of 
vacant staring windows that long 
ago had glowed with warmth and 
life. 

The Rehabilitation Director had 
explained about the deserted vil- 
lages, the emptying cities, the ap- 
proaching desuetude of Earth. In- 
terstellar Travel had given back the 
dream that Interplanetary Travel 
had taken away. Arid Venus and 
bleak Mars were uninhabitable, 
and the ice-choked outer planets 
weren’t planets at all, but wheeling 
glaciers glinting malevolently in 
pale sunlight. Alpha Centauri 4 
was something else, however, and 
Sirius 41 was a dream come true. 

The Sweike Drive had delivered 
Man from the dilemma in which 
his proclivity to overproduce him- 
self had involved him, and Earth 
was losing its population as fast as 

ONE LOVE HAVE I 



ships could be built to transport 
colonists to the stars. There were 
colonies as far out as Vega and be- 
fore long there would be one in the 
Arcturus system. Except for the 
crews who manned the ships, in- 
terstellar runs were a one way 
proposition. People went out to dis- 
tant suns and settled in spacious 
valleys, in virgin timberlands, at 
the feet of unexploited mountains. 
They did not return. And it was 
better that way, the Rehabilitation 
Director had said, for a one way 
ticket resolved the otherwise irre- 
solvable problem of the Lorentz 
transformation. 

Philip looked out at the tumbled 
green hills through which the car 
was passing. It was late afternoon, 
and long shadows lay coolly in deep 
valleys. The sun was low in the 
sky, reddening, and around it cu- 
mulus clouds were becoming riot- 
ous with color. A wind wrinkled the 
foliage of new forests, bent the 
meadow grass on quiet hillsides. 

He sighed. Earth was sufficient 
for him. The stars could give him 
nothing that he could not find 
here: a woodland to walk in, a 
stream to read by, a blue sky to 
soften his sorrow . 

The tumbled hills gave way to 
fields, and the fields ushered in a 
vaguely familiar stand of cedars. 
He became aware that the car was 
slowing, and glancing up at the 
station screen he saw the nostalgic 
name spelled out in luminescent 
letters: CEDARVILLE. He got up 
numbly and pulled his slender 
valise from the overhead rack. His 
chest was tight and he could feel 
a throbbing in his temple. 

Through the window he caught 
glimpses of outlying houses, of col- 

67 




lapsed walls and sagging roofs, of 
moldering porches and overgrown 
yards. For a moment he thought 
that he couldn’t go through with 
it, that he couldn’t force himself to 
go through with it. Then he real- 
ized that the car had stopped, and 
he saw the compartment door slide 
open and the metallic steps leaf 
out. He descended the steps with- 
out thinking, down to the reinforced 
platform. His feet had hardly 
touched the ancient timbers before 
the car was in motion again, hum- 
ming swiftly away on its overhead 
rail, losing itself in the haze of ap- 
proaching evening. 

He stood without moving for a 
long time. The utter silence that 
precedes evening in the country 
was all around him. In the west, 
the wake of the sun was deepening 
from orange to scarlet, and the 
first night shadows were creeping 
in from the east. 

Presently he turned and started 
up the street that led to the center 
of the village. He walked slowly, 
avoiding the clumps of grass that 
had thrust up through the cracks 
and crevices in the old macadam, 
ducking beneath the low limbs of 
tangled maples. The first houses 
began to appear, standing forlornly 
in their jungles of yards. Philip 
looked at them and they looked 
back with their sunken staring 
eyes, and he looked quickly away. 

When he reached the point 
where the street sloped down into 
the little valley where the village 
proper lay, he paused. The cem- 
etery was on the opposite slope of 
the valley and to reach it he would 
have to pass Maple Street, the 
community hall, the university, and 
half a hundred other remembered 

68 



places. No matter how much he 
steeled himself, he would experi- 
ence the tug of a thousand associ- 
ations, relive a thousand cherished 
moments. 

Suddenly his strength drained 
from him and he sat down on his 
upended valise. What is hell? he 
asked himself. Hell, he answered 
himself, is the status reserved for 
the individuals of a totalitarian 
state who voice truths contrary to 
the rigid credo of that state; who 
write books criticizing the self-ap- 
pointed guardians of mass man’s 
intellectual boundaries. 

Hell is what remains to a man 
when everything he loves has been 
taken away. 

It had been a modest book, 
rather thin, with an academic 
jacket done in quiet blue. It had 
been published during the fall of 
the same year he had married 
Miranda, and at first it had made 
no stir at all. The name of it had 
been The New Sanhedrin. 

Then, during the winter, it had 
caught the collective eye of that 
subdivision of the Congressional 
State known as the Subversive 
Literature Investigative Body, and 
almost immediately accusations had 
begun to darken the front pages of 
newspapers and to resound on the 
newscasts. The SLIB had wasted 
no time. It set out to crucify Philip, 
the way the high priests of the San- 
hedrin had set out to crucify Christ 
over two thousand years ago. 

He had not believed they would 
go so far. In developing his analogy 
between the Congressional State 
and the Sanhedrin, demonstrating 
how both guarded their supreme 
power by eliminating everyone who 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 




deviated from the existent thought- 
world, he had anticipated publicity, 
perhaps even notoriety. He had 
never anticipated imprisonment, 
trial, and condemnation; he had 
never dreamed that a political 
crime could rate the supreme pun- 
ishment of that new device of in- 
human ingenuity which had sup- 
planted the chair and the gas 
chamber and the gallows — the Sus- 
pended Animation Chambers 
popularly known as the Deep 
Freeze. 

He had underestimated the 
power of his own prose and he had 
underestimated the power of the 
group his prose had censured. He 
had forgotten that totalitarian gov- 
ernments are always on the lookout 
for scapegoats; someone to make 
an example of, a person with few 
funds and with no political influ- 
ence, and preferably a person en- 
gaged in one of the professions 
which the mass of men have always 
resented. Specifically, an obscure 
political philosopher. 

He had forgotten, but he had re- 
membered. He had remembered on 
that bleak morning in April, when 
he heard the puppet judge intone 
the sentence — “One hundred years 
suspended animation for subver- 
sive activities against the existent 
governing body, term to begin Sep- 
tember 14, 2046 and to expire 
September 14, 2146. Gradien cell 
locks to be employed, so that any 
attempt by future governing au- 
thorities to alleviate said term shall 
result in the instant death of the 
prisoner. 

The months between April and 
September had fled like light. 
Miranda visited him every day, and 
the two of them tried to force the 



rest of their lives into fleeting sec- 
onds, into precious moments that 
kept slipping through their fingers. 
In May they celebrated Philip’s 
birthday, and in July, Miranda’s 
The celebration in each case con- 
sisted of a “Happy Birthday, dar- 
ling,” and a kiss stolen behind the 
omnipresent guard’s back. 

And all the while he had seen 
the words in her eyes, the words she 
had wanted to say desperately and 
couldn’t say, the words, “I’ll wait 
for you, darling.” And he knew 
that she would have waited if she 
only could have, that she would 
have waited gladly; but no woman 
could wait for you a hundred years, 
no matter how much she loved you, 
no matter how faithful she was. 

He had seen the words in her 
eyes in the last moment, had seen 
them trembling on her lips ; and he 
had known what not being able to 
say them had done to her. He had 
seen the pain in the soft lines of 
her child-like face, in the curve of 
her sensitive mouth, and he had 
felt it in her farewell kiss — the an- 
guish, the despair, the hopelessness. 
And he had stood there woodenly 
before the elevator, between the 
guards, unable to cry because tears 
were inadequate, unable to smile 
because his lips were stiff, because 
his cheeks were stone, and his jaw 
granite. 

She was the last thing he saw be- 
fore the elevator door slid shut, and 
that was as it should have been. She 
was standing in front of the Deep 
Freeze window and behind her, be- 
hind the cruel interstices of wire 
mesh, the blue September sky 
showed, the exact hue of her eyes. 
That was the way he had remem- 
bered her during the descent to the 

69 



ONE LOVE HAVE I 




underground units and along the 
clammy corridor to his refrigerated 
cell. 



T HE DAYS of dictatorships, 
whether they be collective or 
individual, are numbered. The 
budding dictatorship of Philip’s day 
was no more than an ugly memory 
now. The Sweike Drive had 
thwarted it, had prevented it from 
coming into flower. For man’s 
frustrations faded, when he found 
that he could reach the stars; and 
without frustrations to exploit, no 
dictatorship can survive. 

But the harm small men do out- 
lives them, Philip thought. And if 
that axiom had been true before 
the advent of the Deep Freeze, it 
was doubly true now. With the 
Deep Freeze man had attained 
Greek tragedy. 

He lit a cigarette and the bright 
flame of his lighter brought the 
deepening shadows of the street 
into bold relief. With a shock he 
realized that night had fallen, and 
looking up between the tangled 
trees he saw the first star. 

He stood up and started down 
the sloping street. As he progressed, 
more stars came out, bringing the 
ancient macadam into dim reality. 
A night wind came up and 
breathed in the trees, whispered in 
the wild timothy that had pre- 
empted tidy lawns, rattled rachitic 
shutters. 

He knew that seeing the house 
would only cause him pain, but it 
was a pain he had to endure, for 
homecoming would not be com- 
plete until he had stepped upon his 
own doorstep. So when he came to 
Maple Street he turned down the 

70 



overgrown sidewalk, making his 
way slowly between giant hedges 
and riotous saplings. For a moment 
he thought he saw the flicker of a 
light far down the street, but he 
could not be sure. 

He knew of course that there 
was very little chance that the 
house would still be standing — a 
hundred years is a long time for a 
house to live — that if it were still 
standing it would probably be 
changed beyond recognition, de- 
cayed beyond recognition. 

And yet, it was still standing and 
it had not changed at all. It was 
just the same as it had been when 
he had left it over a hundred years 
ago, and there was a light shining 
in the living room window. 

He stood very still in the sham- 
bles of the street. The house isn’t 
real, he told himself. It can’t be 
real. I won’t believe that it’s real 
until I touch it, until I feel its wood 
beneath my fingertips, its floor be- 
neath my feet. He walked slowly 
up the little walk. The front lawn 
was neatly trimmed and there 
were two tiny catalpa trees stand- 
ing in newly turned plots of 
ground. He mounted the steps to 
the latticed porch and the steps 
were solid beneath his feet and gave 
forth the sound of his footsteps. 

He touched the print lock of the 
door with the tip of his ring finger 
and the door obediently opened. 
Diffidently he stepped over the 
threshold and the door swung gen- 
tly to behind him. 

There was a mauve-grey parlor 
suite in the living room and it 
matched the mauve-grey curtains 
on the windows. Pine knots were 
ruddy in the open fireplace and his 
books stood in stately rows on the 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 




flanking built-in shelves. Miranda’s 
knickknacks covered the mantel. 

His easy chair was drawn up be- 
fore the fire and his slippers were 
waiting on the floor beside it. His 
favorite pipe reposed on a nearby 
end table and a canister of his fa- 
vorite tobacco stood beside it. On 
the arm of the chair was a brand 
new copy of The New Sanhedrin . 

He stood immobile just within 
the door, trying hard to breathe. 
Then he superimposed a rigid ob- 
jectivity upon the subjective chaos 
of his thoughts, and forced himself 
to see the room as it really was and 
not as he wished it to be. 

The lamp in the window was 
like the lamp Miranda had kept in 
the window a hundred years ago, 
but it wasn’t the same lamp. It was 
a duplication. And the parlor suite 
was very much like the one that 
had been in the room a hundred 
years ago when he had carried 
Miranda over the threshold, and 
yet it wasn’t quite the same, and 
neither were the curtains. There 
were differences in the material, in 
the design — slight differences, but 
apparent enough if you looked for 
them. And his easy chair — that was 
a duplication too, as were his slip- 
pers and his pipe; The New San - 
he dr in. 

The fireplace was the same, and 
yet not quite the same : the pattern 
of the bricks was different, the 
bricks themselves were different, 
the mantel was different. And the 
knickknacks on the mantel — 

He choked back a sob as he 
walked over to examine them more 
closely, for they were not duplica- 
tions. They were originals and time 
had been unkind to them. Some of 
them were broken and a patina of 

ONE LOVE HAVE I 



the years covered all of them. They 
were like children’s toys found in 
an attic on a rainy day. 

He bent over his books, and they 
were originals too. He pulled one 
from the shelf and opened it. The 
yellowed pages betrayed the pass- 
age of the years and he replaced 
it tenderly. Then he noticed the 
diary on the topmost shelf. 

He took it down with trembling 
hands, opened and turned its pages. 
When he saw the familiar hand- 
writing, he knew whose diary it was 
and suddenly his knees were weak 
and he could not stand, and he col- 
lapsed into the easy chair before 
the fire. 

Numbly he turned the pages to 
the first entry. It was dated Sep- 
tember 15, 2146 — 

I walked down the steps , the 
stone slabs of steps that front the 
tomb in which men are buried 
alive , and 1 walked through the 
streets of the city . 

1 walked through the streets , the 
strange streets, past hordes of in- 
different people . Gradually I be- 
came aware of the passing hours, 
the fleeting minutes, the swift- 
flying seconds; and each second be- 
came an unbearable pain, each 
minute a dull agony, each hour a 
crushing eternity . 

1 do not know how I came to the 
spaceport . Perhaps God directed 
my footsteps there. But the moment 
I saw the shimmering spires of the 
new ships pointing into the Septem- 
ber sky, everything 1 had ever read 
concerning the Sweike Drive coa- 
lesced blindingly in my mind, and 
1 knew what I had to do. 

A clock which is in motion moves 
slower than a stationary clock. The 

71 




difference is imperceptible at ordi- 
nary velocities , but when the speed 
of light is approached, the differ- 
ence is enormous. 

The Sweike Drive approaches 
the speed of light . It approaches 
the speed of light as closely as it can 
be approached , without both men 
and ship becoming pure energy . 

A clock on a ship employing the 
Sweike Drive would barely move at 
all— 

Not daring to believe, he skipped 
a page — 

September 18, 2146 — They tell 
me it will take two years! Two of 
my sweet, my precious years to be- 
come a space-line stewardess! But 
there’s no other way, no other way 
at all, and my application is al- 
ready in. 1 know they will accept it 
—with everyone clamoring for the 
stars the need for ship’s personnel 
is — 

His hands were shaking uncon- 
trollably and the pages escaped 
from his fingers, days, months, years 
fluttering wildly by. He halted them 
finally — 

June 3, 2072 (Sirius 41) — I have 
measured time by many moving 
clocks, and moving clocks are kind. 
But when planetfall arrives, sta- 
tionary clocks take over, and sta- 
tionary clocks are not kind. You 
wait in some forsaken port for the 
return run and you count each min- 
ute and resent its passage bitterly. 
For over the decades, the minutes 
add together into months and years 
and you are afraid that despite the 
moving clocks, you will be too old 
after all — 

72 



The pages escaped again and he 
stopped them at the final entry — 

February 9, 2081 — Today I was 
officially notified that my applica- 
tion for the Arcturus run has been 
accepted ! I have been in a kind of 
ecstatic trance ever since, dreaming 
and planning, because 1 can dream 
and plan now! Now I know that I 
shall see my beloved again, and 1 
shall wear a white gardenia in my 
hair, and the perfume he likes the 
best, and I shall have our house 
rebuilt and everything in it restored 
— there’ll be plenty of time if the 
65 year estimate is correct; and 
when my beloved is released I shall 
be there waiting to take him in my 
arms, and though I shall not be as 
young as he remembers me, I shall 
not be old either. And the lonely 
years between the stars shall not 
have been in vain — 

For 1 have only one love. I shall 
never have another . 



T HE WORDS blurred on the 
page and Philip let the diary 
slip from his fingers to the arm of 
the chair. “Miranda,” he whis- 
pered. 

He stood up. “Miranda,” he said. 
The house was silent. “Miran- 
da!” he called. “Miranda!” 

There was no answer. He went 
from the living room to the bed- 
room. The bedroom was the way 
it had been a hundred years ago 
except that it was empty now. 
Empty of Miranda. 

He returned to the living room 
and went into the kitchen. The 
kitchen was the same too, but there 
was no Miranda in it. He switched 
on the light and stared at the porce- 

ROBERT F. YOUNG 




lain sink, the chrome stove, the 
white cupboards, the gleaming 
utility table — 

There was a hand mirror lying 
on the table, and beside it was a 
crumpled gardenia. He picked up 
the gardenia and it was cool and 
soft in his hand. He held it to his 
nostrils and breathed its fresh scent. 
There was another scent mingled 
with it, a delicate fragrant scent. 
He recognized it immediately as 
Miranda’s perfume. 

Suddenly he could not breathe, 
and he ran out of the house and 
into the darkness. He saw the light 
flickering at the end of the street 
then, and he walked toward it with 
unbelieving steps. The community 
hall grew slowly out of the darkness 
and the light became many lights, 
became bright windows. From 
somewhere in the surrounding 
shadows he heard the humming of a 
portable generator. 

When he climbed the steps a 
hundred years flew away. There was 
no 77c supper of course, and the 
hall showed unmistakable signs of 
age, despite the fact that it had 
been recently remodeled. But there 
was Miranda. Miranda standing by 
a lonely table. Miranda crying. A 
more mature Miranda, with lines 



showing on her face where no lines 
had showed before, but light 
lines, adorable lines. 

He realized why she had not met 
him at the Deep Freeze. She had 
been afraid, afraid that the moving 
clocks had not moved slowly 
enough after all; and she must 
have decided to meet him at the 
house instead, for she knew he 
would come home. She must have 
heard the monorail car pull in, 
must have known he was on his 
way — 

Suddenly he remembered the 
mirror and the crumpled gardenia. 

Silly girl, lovely girl — His eyes 
misted and he felt the tears run 
down his cheeks. He stumbled into 
the room, and she came hesitantly 
forward to meet him, her face 
beautiful with the new years. A 
goddess in the room, a mature god- 
dess, the awkwardness gone for- 
ever, the schoolgirlish charm left 
somewhere in the abysses between 
the stars; his goddess — and then a 
goddess in his arms, warm and sud- 
denly tight-pressed against him, her 
dark hair soft against his face, her 
voice whispering in his ear, across 
the years, across the timeless infini- 
ties, “Welcome home, darling. Wel- 
come home.” • • •

ence is there from our sun?” 

Willie held the color chart up 
beside the spectrum screen. “Al- 
most on. Couple of degrees differ- 
ence.” He tossed the chart on the 
desk and came to stand at Tom’s 



side, the top of his head even with 
Tom’s erect shoulder. His thin face 
was tense and worried. 

“Tom,” he said, “I have a hunch 
about this star.” He stared at the 
screen morosely. 

“I don’t receive a thing,” Tom 
chuckled, stretching his flat muscled 
arms to the low ceiling, his body 
making a triangle from his narrow 
hips to his wide shoulders. “What’s 
the hunch?” 

“Ever have the feeling you’d 
been some place before when you’d 
actually never been there? I feel 
that about this star.” Willie glanced 
at Tom with his bright blue eyes,

then looked quickly away, a bit of a 
red flush high on his cheeks. 

“It’s just because it’s like our 
sun, that’s all,” Tom said. 

“No, it’s not that, Tom. It’s some- 
thing else. I feel like we ought to 
get out of here. Maybe it’s the 
planet.” 

“Planet?” Tom said. 

“Yes,” Willie said quietly, “an 
Earth type planet.” 

“Earth type!” Tom shouted. 
“Ten thousand credits bonus! Get 
it on the screen, Willie. Let’s see 
that spending money baby.” 

Willie turned on the viewer. Dark 
and shadowy on one side, bright 
with blue-green color on the other, 
the planet floated on the screen. 

“The blue must be water and 
the green continents,” Tom mur- 
mured in awe. “Damn, it’s beauti- 
ful. We going to pass it close?” 

“In about five more minutes of 
this spiral,” Willie answered. “Say, 
Tom,” Willie said hesitantly, “will 
you check over these figures? I’m 
not sure I’ve allowed enough for 
the pull of the sun.” He shifted the 
papers aimlessly. 

“My gosh, Willie,” Tom said, 
“the only thing I know about navi- 
gation is what you’ve taught me 
this trip. Your figures are right.” 
“I just wanted to make sure I’m 
right,” Willie said. “I don’t like to 
navigate close in.” He pushed the 
papers back on the desk. “I guess 
I’d better call the big shot and let 
him take over.” He pressed the 
button that rang the buzzer in the 
Captain’s tiny cabin. 

“Might as well let Pudge in on it 
too,” Tom said, “or the food will be 
lousy for days.” 

“Yeah,” Willie said, and buzzed 
the galley. 

76 



Captain Bart strode into the 
cabin, his barrel chest bare and 
hairy above the shorts he had been 
napping in. He went straight to the 
porthole and stood with his fists on 
his hips, appraising the sun. Then 
he caught sight of the blue-green 
ball on the scope. 

“Earth type planet! Nice going, 
Willie,” he shouted, and clapped 
Willie on the back. 

Willie flinched slightly, then 
moved over to the chart desk, a 
frown making vertical creases in his 
forehead. 

Bart turned to Tom without no- 
ticing. “Ten thousand credits, 
Tom. I knew we’d do it. Even in 
this forty year old tub. Willie, are 
we going to pass it close?” 

“Two more minutes,” Willie 
murmured, busy with the charts on 
the desk. “You’d better check my 
course, though.” 

“O.K.,” Bart said. “Let her go 
as she’s headed.” 

Pudge came in from the galley 
and took his place beside Tom 
without comment. 

“Okay,” Bart said, as he sat 
down in the control board chair, 
“let’s get to work. Willie, I’ll run 
us past just outside the atmosphere. 
Tom, you do the life search. Pudge, 
get the pictures.” 

The cabin was silent except for 
the hum of the instruments. The 
radar probed the height of the 
mountains, the depth of the seas, 
the shape of the continents by re- 
cording the patterns of the reflec- 
tions. 

The electron telescopes hunted 
down the movement of life, the 
artificial straight lines of civiliza- 
tion, the classification of plants; 
and typed the metals in the ground 

MIKE ELLIS 




with the aid of a spectrum. 

The wave lengths of radio and 
TV were checked and recorded. 

One special instrument, sealed 
in its cabinet and booby-trapped 
with explosives against tampering, 
probed for the faint waves of any 
kind of life, down to single cells in 
the seas. 

They made four passes, the last 
one at a hundred miles from the 
ground at its closest point. Then, 
as each man finished his task and 
relaxed from his instruments, they 
waited for the automatic tally of 
the results. 

The computer glowed and 
clicked in its dull grey cabinet on 
the bulkhead, then dropped the 
tally card in the slot. 

Bart snatched it out, his grin fad- 
ing to a blank look as he read it. 
“Nothing. Not a damn thing, no life 
at all.” He went over to the screen, 
folded his thick arms across his 
chest, and stared at it in disgust. 

Tom picked up the card and 
studied it. “This is goofey,” he said 
aloud, “the planet’s got plant life, 
plenty of it, but not a trace of an- 
imal life, not even plankton in the 
sea. How’d that happen?” 

Willie came over and studied the 
card with Tom. “Gould have bac- 
teria we didn’t get from this 
height, but it sure as hell hasn’t got 
anything else.” 

Pudge held up the pictures ; they 
showed close-ups of a tangled mass 
of plants. “All ferns,” he said. 
“Doesn’t seem to be anything else.” 

“Why would a planet have ferns 
and nothing else, not even the be- 
ginning of animal life?” Tom won- 
dered aloud. 

“I once read an account of find- 
ing the tiny seeds of Earth’s plants 

WILLIE'S PLANET 



millions of miles out in space,” 
Willie said. “Seems the winds blow 
them right off the planet and 
they’re so light they just keep 
going.” He looked at the pictures, 
then at Tom. “Suppose some of 
them drifted here?” 

“That’s as good a guess as any- 
thing else,” Tom said. “Maybe the 
master minds at home can figure it 
out.” 

“Only seven or eight Earth-type 
planets in all these years of star 
mapping and I had to find one 
with nothing but ferns on it,” Bart 
said in disgust to the screen. “Oh, 
well, maybe it’ll do as a colony. No 
alien life to worry about, anyway. 
We’ll call it Bart McDonald 
Planet.” 

“Hey,” Tom spoke up, “Willie 
found the planet. He should get to 
name it.” 

Bart was curt. “I’m the captain 
of this ship ; new planets are named 
after the captain that discovers 
them.” 

“Nuts,” Tom muttered. “We all 
had a hand in this. It ought to be 
named after all of us.” 

“How about calling it the ship’s 
name,” Willie put in quietly. 

Bart strode over and yanked the 
log’s keyboard out. He banged furi- 
ously on the keys for a moment, 
and then read aloud. “At 1430 this 
date, discovered McDonald’s planet, 
an Earth class planet, signed, Bart 
McDonald, Captain.” He slammed 
the log shut. 

Tom snorted. 

Bart gave him a dirty look and 
went over and sat in the control 
board chair. Pudge had disap- 
peared in the galley as he always 
did when there was an argument. 
There were a few minutes of 

77 




strained silence as they worked over 
the instruments. 

Bart turned from the control 
board. “As long as this place has no 
life, we’d be safe in landing. Sup- 
pose we earn the bonus by bringing 
back a full report on whether it’s 
fit for a colony or not?” 

Willie’s head jerked up, his face 
white. 

Tom frowned, and said nothing. 
He wanted to land but he didn’t 
want to agree with Bart on any- 
thing. 

“What say?” Bart said. “I’ll even 
put it up for a vote.” 

“Okay,” Tom said, thinking of 
walking in the sun, feeling firm 
ground under his feet. “It would be 
a shame to come all this way and 
then not be able to say we had ex- 
plored the country.” 

“No,” Willie said quickly. “It’s 
dangerous. And — and besides, we’d 
have to go in quarantine when we 
got back.” 

“So we go in quarantine,” Bart 
said. “We’ll get paid for it.” He 
turned to the control board. “Buzz 
Pudge, so he can get ready.” He 
began punching buttons. 

They went around to the middle 
of the day side of the planet, swing- 
ing in closer. The continents 
formed a rough belt around the 
equator of the planet, with no land 
extending to the small ice caps on 
the poles. 

Tom felt his stomach knot with 
the thrill of going into the un- 
known as he watched the screen, 
but part of the time he was running 
the lights of the control board 
through his mind, checking the 
actions of Bart’s big fingers as Bart 
confidently punched the keys. Then 
he caught sight of Willie’s tense 

78 



face. It was white, with little 
splotches of pink, and his slender 
hands were gripping the chair he 
was sitting in. 

“Here we go,” Bart shouted ex- 
ultantly, as the big green light 
flashed on. He hit the big green 
key with a stubby forefinger. The 
auto pilot fired the jets, the ship 
slowed in its descent, and they were 
pushed down gently in their chairs. 
As the spot Bart had picked came 
up on the screen, they could see 
the bare red of the ridge sticking up 
out of the yellow-green of the flat 
land. Then the yellow-green was 
right below them, turning black as 
the jets burned it to ashes. They 
hovered a minute, then came to 
rest with a creaking thud that 
echoed through the ship. The jets 
cut out, leaving their ears ringing. 

“Didn’t know whether we’d 
make it or not,” Willie said. He un- 
obtrusively wiped the glistening 
sweat off this slender palms on his 
coveralls, as he took his place at the 
panel. 

When the tests were done, Bart 
grabbed the tally card as soon as 
the computer dropped it. “No bac- 
teria at all. Planet’s completely 
sterile. Let’s get outside.” 



T OM stopped beside Bart on the 
narrow strip of red sand at 
the edge of the vast blue plain of 
smooth water. The water came 
right up to their feet without move- 
ment, just small ripples that lapped 
the red sand. The air was clean and 
brisk, and the wind was soft on his 
cheek. 

Bart arched his thick chest and 
pulled in a great lung full of air. 
“This is wonderful. Makes a man 

MIKE ELLIS ' 




feel alive again.” He yanked the 
zipper on his coveralls and pulled 
them off. Then he jumped in the 
air, swinging his thick arms. 

Tom grinned at the calisthenics 
as he peeled off his own coveralls. 
The sun was warm on his bare 
white skin. 

Bart had pulled off his boots and 
with just hiis shorts left, charged 
into the water, and made a flat 
smashing dive. He leaped and 
splashed the water like a porpoise. 

Tom grinned at him, and just as 
he had done during most of his boy- 
hood on Earth, took a gulp of air 
and dived down into the clear silent 
depths to the twenty foot deep bot- 
tom. He drifted slowly among the 
rocks. Bart drifted beside him as 
the seconds ticked by. Tom wished 
this was Earth and there were some 
fish to hunt in the clear water with 
a three pronged spear. Then, as his 
lungs seemed bursting and he had 
to have air, he put his feet against 
the bottom and shoved himself 
to the surface. Several seconds later, 
Bart burst through the surface and 
bobbed beside him. They floated 
until they got their wind back. 

“You don’t use a suit and oxygen 
tanks,” Bart said. “You couldn’t 
stay under two seconds if you did.” 

“I learned to hunt as a boy,” 
Tom said. “I even had to make 
my own spear out of scraps. Kids 
don’t have the credits for suits and 
stuf f.” 

“No sport to it with a suit,” Bart 
said, as they paddled lazily along 
with their heads up, toward shore. 
“As bad as hunting animals with 
rifles. They killed off all the an- 
imals with guns, now they’re fishing 
out the seas with suits.” 

“Yeah,” Tom answered, “might 

WILLIE'S PLANET 



as well buy the fish from the hatch- 
eries as to go after them with a 
portable sub.” 

They dived under, and worked 
their way along the bottom toward 
shore, coming up for air, then div- 
ing again, until they were back to 
the beach. 

They walked out and dropped 
on the sand to rest, the sun warm 
on them. 

“Notice the water?” Tom asked. 

“Yeah,” Bart said, “no waves. 
Calm as hell. Can’t be waves with- 
out a moon to pull them.” 

“Doesn’t seem to be as salty as 
the seas at home, either,” Tom said. 

“Yeah, I noticed that too. Must 
not be as much salt in the ground 
as at home.” 

“Could be it’s a young planet 
that hasn’t had much time to wash 
it out of the ground, too,” Tom said. 

They rested in silence for a few 
minutes, the only sound all about 
them was the wind blowing across 
the empty land. 

Then Bart jumped to his feet 
and started pulling on his clothes. 
“Come on, Tom,” he said, “Let’s 
take a look around while it’s still 
light.” 

After they dressed, Bart led the 
way along the strip of red sand to- 
wards the ridge. The tangled mass 
of yellow-green vegetation grew 
right down to the strip of red sand, 
and in some places, grew right over 
it to stop at the sea. 

“I’ll be darned,” Tom said, 
stopping at the edge of the plants. 
The ferns covered the ground 
solidly; small ones, medium ones, 
big ones. He crashed back into the 
thicker growth and kicked some of 
it aside with his boot. The cloud of 
dust choked him for a minute. 

79 




Bart came crashing in to Tom. 
“What you got?” 

“Look,” Tom said. “All these 
dead ferns underneath, then just 
the sand. They haven’t decayed.” 
He searched under the dead 
growth. “The dead ones just fall 
down underneath and the live ones 
just grow on top. There’s not only 
no life here, but no decay either. 
Just ferns. I wonder if Willie was 
right.” 

“Don’t ask me,” Bart said. 
“Come on, let’s look from that 
ridge.” 

They followed the sand around 
the impassable vegetation to the 
ridge and scrambled a little way up 
the barren red rocks. As far as they 
could see over the flat land, it was 
covered with the sickly yellow-green 
of the ferns. 

They looked out and rested, then 
noting the sun was getting close to 
the horizon, they made their way 
back to the huge grey splotched 
aluminum hulk of their ship. 

As Tom was about to follow Bart 
up the ladder, he noticed a solitary 
figure sitting at the edge of the sea. 

“Hey, Willie,” he hollered, 
“Come.to chow.” His voice echoed 
in the quiet. The figure waved and 
Tom turned back to join him. He 
sat down on a small boulder near 
where Willie was sitting and lit his 
tiny pipe. 

Willie was sitting leaning back 
against a rock, and gazing dreamily 
out to sea. He didn’t notice Tom. 

“Hey, Willie,” Tom said, puffing 
on his pipe. 

Willie started and turned to 
Tom. “Oh, hi, Tom. I didn’t know- 
you’d come out.” 

“You wouldn’t,” Tom laughed, 
“not in that daydream. Thinking of 

80 



some gal back home?” 

“No, just thinking,” Willie said. 
“Find anything interesting?” 

“Just a lot of rock and ferns,” he 
answered. 

“Notice how the dead plants just 
pack under and don’t decay?” Wil- 
lie asked. 

“Yeah,” Tom puffed his pipe. 
“Looks like your idea of seeds drift- 
ing through space is as good as any 
to explain it. Sure is an odd place. 
Full grown plants, but no decay 
and no sign of evolution.” 

“This is a wonderful place,” 
Willie said as he leaned back 
against the rock. “I’d like to stay 
here for ten years.” 

“Why?” Tom asked. The red of 
the sunset was fading from the high 
clouds, turning them dark grey. 

“Because it’s so quiet.” Willie 
smiled at him. “This is the quietest 
place I’ve ever been in. Does some- 
thing to you.” 

“You should have been a colo- 
nist,” Tom said, “then you could 
live on a place like this and farm 
it.” 

“I’m going to, someday,” Willie 
answered. “I’m saving my pay to 
buy a charter and I’m going to buy 
a place like this.” 

Tom blew out a cloud of smoke. 
Seems like every guy working on 
crowded Earth had the same 
dream. A little farm on a distant 
planet. But few of them ever did 
anything about it. It was a nice 
dream to relieve the monotony of 
working; but a hell of a lot of hard 
work if you actually did it. 

“I’ve even got seeds I saved when 
I was working on the truck farms 
of the West,” Willie talked on, more 
to himself than Tom, “I saved 
them from some of the biggest and 

MIKE ELLIS 




heaviest producing plants. I’ve got 
tomatoes, beans, corn, squash. 
They’ll make a fine beginning.” 

Tom thought of Willie leaving 
the safety and comfort of living that 
was found only in the crowded 
cities of Earth. “Think you’d like 
the loneliness of farming?” he 
asked. 

Willie spoke with conviction. 
“There’s nothing I’d like more. 
That’s why I started star mapping, 
to get out of the mobs. That’s why 
I’m out here.” 

“Dinner’s on,” Pudge called from 
the ship. 

Tom knocked the ashes out of 
his pipe. “Let’s eat.” He led the 
way to the ship. 

T HE MEAL was eaten in an ap- 
preciative silence, for Pudge 
had spread a feast of celebration. 
When the last of the unaccustomed 
delicacies was gone, they pushed 
their plates away. 

“Boy,” Bart grunted out as he 
lit his pipe, “I haven’t eaten like 
that since the last time I was hunt- 
ing. Say, Tom, what say you and I 
go fishing on the Florida coast when 
we get back. We can get a fish 
a day down there.” 

“We’ll do that,” Tom said with- 
out conviction. He knew when they 
got back they would go their dif- 
ferent ways in the eternal quest of 
spacemen back home. 

“I’m due to get a bigger ship 
when I get back,” Bart said expan- 
sively, “and I’m sure going to have 
Pudge for my cook. How about 
you, Tom? You’re due to step up, 
now. Want to be my navigator?” 
“Sure,” Tom said, surprised. 
“We’ll really do some star map- 

WILLIE'S PLANET 



ping,” Bart said. “With a bigger 
and newer ship, we can go clear to 
the end of the galaxy. Who knows 
what we’ll find for tRe Astral Serv- 
ice.” 

“What about me?” Willie said. 
“Am I going to be retired as your 
First Mate?” 

Tom looked at Willie, he had al- 
most forgotten Willie was there be- 
cause he was so quiet. Willie was 
trying to look bright and happy, 
but even through the happy haze, 
Tom could see he looked tired and 
depressed. The wine hadn’t done 
a thing for him, and his dinner was 
only half eaten. 

Bart had looked down at his 
plate, frowning, at Willie’s ques- 
tion. He knocked out the ashes of 
his pipe and tossed it on the table. 
He looked Willie squarely in the 
eye. “I was going to save it until 
we got back, but since you asked, 
I’ll give it to you straight. Willie, 
I’m sending you back for a check- 
up when we get in. You can’t seem 
to do a darn thing anymore, with- 
out having somebody doublecheck 
it. Tom and I have had to navigate 
the ship most of this trip, when you 
were supposed to do it. There’s no 
place out here for a man that can’t 
do his job. It puts too much on the 
others. I think you need a long rest 
or something.” 

Willie sat there, his face white, 
blinking his eyes rapidly. Then he 
lurched to the door, his chair spin- 
ning behind him. Pudge got up and 
went to the galley. 

“What the hell did you do that 
for?” Tom asked Bart. “Why didn’t 
you kid him along and give it to 
him easy when we got back. It 
would have been easier on his feel- 
ings.” 



81 




“That’s not my way,” Bart said. 
“He asked me and I gave it to him 
straight. He’s no good out here any- 
more. In fact, he’s dangerous. If 
something should come up that 
needs quick action, we’d all be 
wiped out by the time he called 
me.” 

“Okay,” Tom said. “It was hon- 
est, and it was truthful. But it sure 
as hell hurt him. I’m going to see 
him and try to ease it over.” 

“You’ll be a good first mate, 
Tom,” Bart said. “But don’t baby 
the crew too much. They’ve either 
got it or they haven’t.” 

Tom went down the narrow pas- 
sageway to Willie’s cabin and 
knocked on the door. When he 
didn’t get an answer, he opened the 
door. Willie was lying on his bunk 
with Jiis face to the wall. He didn’t 
move as Tom sat in the chair. 

“Hey, Willie,” Tom said. “You 
got company. I come in to shoot the 
breeze with you.” 

Willie turned over reluctantly. 
“I’m sorry, Tom. I hate Bart’s guts. 
He’s always so goddam right.” Wil- 
lie clasped his hands behind his 
head on the pillow, and stared at 
the ceiling. “He’ll wash me out of 
this job and then what will I do? 
I’ve failed at everything else I’ve 
tried to do. It’s the people, Tom. I 
can’t do anything in front of 
people. What am I going to do 
when they ground me? I can’t stand 
the crowds of people on Earth.” He 
rolled over against the wall. 

Tom worked his big knuckled 
long fingers together. “Maybe it 
won’t amount to anything. The 
brass will just put you on another 
ship.” 

“Not if he puts in that report,” 
Willie said, his voice muffled against 

82 



the wall. 

Tom sat there. There was noth- 
ing more to say. Willie was right. 
“Well, I’ll see you on the morning.” 
He got up. “Maybe we can go for 
a hike or something.” When Willie 
didn’t answer, he went out and 
carefully shut the door behind him. 

In his own bunk, he tried to think 
of something else, but the problem 
of Willie bothered him for a long, 
restless time. Then it was morning 
and the clock was chiming. 

Pudge came in to the table where 
Tom and Bart were waiting for 
breakfast. “Some one’s been in the 
stores. A couple of cases of emer- 
gency rations are missing. It must 
have been in the night.” 

“What the hell,” Bart said, jump- 
ing up. “In the stores?” 

# “Where’s Willie?” Tom said, get- 
ting up. 

“Who cares,” Bart said. “There’s 
no one on this planet but us. Who’d 
get into our stores? Or what?” 

“That’s what I mean,” Tom said 
angrily. “Where’s Willie?” 

Bart gave him a startled glance, 
then led the way to Willie’s cabin. 
He wasn’t there. They went 
through the ship. They dropped 
out of the lock, one after the other, 
into the blinding sunlight and 
looked around. Willie was gone. 

“We’d better find him before he 
gets too far,” Tom said. “I’ve got a 
hunch he’s not coming back. That’s 
why the food.” 

“I’ll wring the little coward’s 
neck,” Bart said as he led the way 
along the one trail of footprints 
they had all made to the sand by the 
sea. They scattered out, calling and 
looking. Tom, on a hunch, headed 
for the shoulder of the mountain 
that jutted out in the sea, while 

MIKE ELLIS 




Bart and Pudge went the other way. 

T HE SUN was high in the clear 
blue sky when Tom at last 
came around the point to the little 
cove a stream had made in the side 
of the mountain. He walked up the 
narrow sandy bank between the 
red cliffs until a short way in, he 
found the cases of food and a pile 
of blankets. His yell echoed off the 
red cliffs several times before he 
looked up to see Willie standing on 
top of the cliff twenty feet above 
him. 

“Come on back to the ship, Wil- 
lie, Tom called as though Willie 
was just out for a walk. “We’re go- 
ing to blast off this afternoon. Got 
to head home.” 

“I’m not coming back,” Willie 
said. “I’m staying here.” 

“Be reasonable,” Tom shouted, 
“you can’t stay here. Come on back 
to the ship.” 

“I’m going to live here. I’m go- 
ing to colonize,” Willie said. 

“What?” Tom’s voice was unbe- 
lieving. 

“I’m going to live here,” Willie 
repeated. “Tom, give me your word 
you won’t force me to go back and 
I’ll come down so we can talk.” 
“O.K.,” Tom said, “you have my 
word.” 

“Bart isn’t around, is he?” Willie 
slid down the cliff in a shower of 
loose rock and dirt. 

“You can’t stay here, Willie,” 
Tom began, “how are you going to 
live, to eat?” 

“I’ve got my seeds,” Willie said 
dreamily. “I’ll have a real farm.” 
He waved vaguely at the ferns. 
“Look at the stuff grow. The cli- 
mate is ideal. I’ll build a hut and 

WILLIE'S PLANET 



farm enough to eat.” 

“Willie,” Tom said, trying 
another angle. “There are no other 
people here. What’ll you do if you 
get sick or need help?” 

“I won’t get sick and I won’t 
need help,” Willie said. “That’s 
why I want to stay here, ’cause 
there aren’t any people. I can have 
a thousand acres all to myself. I can 
stake out a whole square mile and 
live right in the middle of it.” He 
laughed like a little kid. “Tom, this 
is what I’ve wanted all my life. 
Why should I go back to Earth and 
then try to come back later, I’m 
staying here, now.” 

Tom had the feeling he was try- 
ing to argue with an ostrich with its 
head in the sand. What would 
Willie do for food if his crops failed 
when the emergency rations were 
gone? Willie was gambling his life 
for a dream, but he didn’t know it. 
Willie saw only what he wanted to 
see, disregarding everything else. 
Arguing was useless. The only way 
they could get Willie back aboard 
was to carry him back. 

“Well, okay, Willie,” Tom said. 
“I’ll go back and tell Bart. But I’ll 
get him to hold the ship until to- 
morrow if you should change your 
mind.” 

“I won’t,” Willie said. “So long, 
Tom.” He held out his hand. 
“You’ve been a swell guy.” 

Tom took the hand and shook it. 
“So long, Willie. I’ll be back 
someday, to see how you’re making 
out.” He started back down the 
narrow beach. Along the way, he 
decided that they would have to 
catch Willie and take him back to 
Earth for hospitalization. Coming 
back with Bart wouldn’t be break- 
ing his word. That had only been 

83 




for the time he had talked to Willie. 

Bart heard Tom’s report in his 
usual way. “Let’s go/’ was his only 
comment. 

They climbed up the crumbling 
red rock and followed the edge of 
the cliff. They climbed over the 
small boulders, around the huge 
ones, endlessly finding the way 
blocked, but each time going back 
a little and by going around, find- 
ing a new way that was clear. The 
sun was halfway to the western 
horizon when they stopped to rest 
on a pile of small boulders near the 
top. Tom leaned back against the 
rock behind him. A trickle of sweat 
ran down his ribs from his armpit 
under his coveralls. 

Bart snorted through his nose. 
“It’ll be dark soon.” He wiped his 
arm across his forehead, the sweat 
making a dark stain on the sleeve. 
“Damn that fool Willie. He’ll pay 
for this when we get him back to 
Earth. He must be crazy or some- 
thing.” 

“My God,” Tom said. “Is that 
finally dawning on you?” 

Bart looked up at Tom, his dark 
brown eyes small in his broad 
sweat-streaked face. As he con- 
tinued to stare at Tom without say- 
ing anything, Tom felt the stir of 
annoyance, then the beginning of 
hot tempered anger. They sat and 
waited, looking for the movement 
Willie would make if he showed 
himself. Nothing stirred in the yel- 
low-green ferns below. After an 
hour of watching, Bart got to his 
feet. 

“He’s holed up somewhere and 
pulled the hole in after him. Let’s 
get down there and drag him out.” 
He started back down the ridge the 
way they had come up. 

84 



Halfway down, as they stopped 
for a breather, Tom noted the 
height of the sun. It was going to 
be dark before they could work 
their way back to the ship. A low 
bank of rolling grey clouds lay all 
along the straight horizon line of 
the sea; as the sun sank behind the 
clouds, it turned the edges of them 
to fiery red. 

Bart hurried down the ridge, 
watching only for a glimpse of Wil- 
lie, but Tom looked at the sunset 
occasionally, trying to store up the 
memory of the color for the months 
ahead. 

As they reached the stream cliff, 
Tom stopped Bart. 

“Bart, I’ve got an idea. It’s al- 
most dark. Willie will think we’ve 
headed back to get to the ship be- 
fore it’s too dark to find our way. 
He’s probably sitting on a rock, 
watching the sunset and daydream- 
ing. Let’s look on the edge of this 
little cliff where it ends at the sea.” 

“O.K.,” Bart said, leading the 
way. The only light left was the re- 
flected red light of the clouds that 
made long dark shadows behind 
the rocks. 

They came around the rocks, on- 
to the cliff point overlooking the 
sea and the cove, and there was 
Willie, sitting with his back to a 
big rock, his chin resting on his 
cupped hands, gazing dreamily out 
to sea. 

“Willie!” Bart shouted, lunging 
for him. 

Willie jerked around to see them, 
then he was up and sliding down 
the loose rock into the shadowy 
cove below. 

“Grab him, Tom,” Bart shouted 
as he went sliding and falling down, 
the loose rock after him. 

MIKE ELLIS 




Tom jumped down the rocks to 
the bottom and slid to a stop, the 
loose rocks rolling down around 
him, but Willie was deep in the 
ferns with only his head and shoul- 
ders showing. 

Bart had the automatic pistol out 
and pointed at Willie. “Stop you 
crazy fool, or I’ll shoot,” he 
shouted, his voice echoing off the 
cliffs. Willie only crashed into the 
ferns more desperately. 

Bart raised the automatic and 
fired a burst of shots, the sharp 
explosions echoing shatteringly 
around them. Tom made a flying 
tackle and smashed into Bart. They 
went down in the ferns, struggling 
for the gun, until Bart managed to 
roll and push his way to his feet. 

“Knock it off,” Bart shouted. 
“What the hell are you trying to 
do?” 

“Keep you from killing him,” 
Tom shouted back as he got to his 
feet. 

“I wasn’t trying to kill him,” Bart 
snapped. “I was trying to scare him 
into stopping so we could grab him, 
now he’s got clean away in those 
damn ferns.” He waved a hand 
helplessly at the mass of dark vege- 
tation. Willie was gone all right. 
“Now we’ll have to spend days 
hunting for that lunatic. Next time 
let me handle it. I’m the captain of 
this expedition.” 

“Okay,” Tom said angrily, “but 
let’s catch him, not kill him. He 
hasn’t done anything, just wants to 
be alone, that’s all.” 

“He’s deserted,” Bart said, “and 
he signed articles, so that’s a crime. 
How the hell am I going to explain 
a lost crewman when we go back. 
And on my first trip as captain.” 

“That’s your worry,” Tom said. 

WILLIE'S PLANET 



“He’s colonizing, not deserting.” 

“You should have been a law- 
yer,” Bart said as he put the gun in 
his holster. “But this isn’t getting 
that screwball aboard.” He groped 
in the pocket of his coveralls and 
pulled out a small packlight. The 
white searchbeam lit up the ferns 
around them with glaring bright- 
ness. “Come on, let’s try to find 
him.” He led the way into the ferns. 

They hunted through the ferns, 
forcing their way every step. The 
searchbeam was only good for a 
few feet in the dense growth. They 
knew Willie was close, but in the 
ferns they could almost step on him 
and not know it. 

At last Bart gave up. “Let’s go 
back to the ship. We’ll come back 
in the morning, when it’s light.” 
Following him along the beach to- 
ward the ship, Tom had the feeling 
that in the morning might be too 
late. Willie might have been hit by 
the burst of shots, or he might take 
off in the ferns so far they never 
could find him. 



T OM rolled out of his bunk at 
the first bell, wincing at his 
sore muscles. After getting the first 
aid kit from the bathroom, he 
quietly walked down the narrow 
passageway and out into the bright 
sunlight. As he walked through the 
grey ash to the strip of red sand, 
the quiet was like a blanket over 
everything, after the soft hum of 
the living ship. The breeze blew 
softly against his face, hummed 
past his ears, and rustled the ferns. 
The sea was glass smooth as far as 
he could see across its surface, 
smooth right up to where the water 
turned deep green as it got shal- 

65 




lower. He could understand why 
Willie wanted to stay here. It was 
a perfect place for anyone who 
loved solitude and there was prob- 
ably none like it in the whole sys- 
tem. 

He thought of how a man could 
live here, with no one to bother 
him, nothing to buy, no need to do 
any more than just produce enough 
food to live. A little shack to keep 
off the rain, a little field to grow 
food. 

But there would be no one to talk 
to, no one to share experiences and 
troubles and little triumps, no one 
to laugh with, no challenge to over- 
come, no excitement. 

“Not for me,” Tom said aloud, 
and his voice was strange in the 
quiet. “Boy, this place puts a spell 
on a guy, almost hypnotizes him.” 
He laughed aloud. “Even got me 
talking to myself.” He hurried on to 
hunt for Willie. 

Then he came to the little cove 
where Willie had his camp. The 
pile of food and blankets was still 
there. Willie was there, too. He 
was lying half in the pool of water. 
As Tom crunched over the sand 
and knelt beside him, Willie 
opened his eyes. 

“Hi, Tom,” he said faintly. “Fm 
glad you came alone.” 

“Hi, Willie,” Tom said as he 
looked at the thin chest with the 
small neat hole low on the left side. 
“So he did shoot you, didn’t he.” 
He opened the first aid kit. “I’ll get 
you back to the ship and you’ll be 
O.K.” He started putting a dress- 
ing on the wound. 

Willie looked at him with his 
bright blue eyes. “Never mind, 
Tom. I just got to stay here in spite 
of the Captain.” His voice was so 



low Tom had to lean closer to hear 
him. Willie coughed slightly and 
winced with the pain. 

Tom finished the bandage. He 
knew there was nothing he could 
do; Willie was hurt inside and only 
a doctor could help him. But there 
were no doctors here. He wanted 
to do something for him to make 
him more comfortable. He started 
to put an arm under him to move 
him out of the pool. “I’ll get you 
out of this water,” he said. 

“No. Tom,” Willie said. “Leave 
me here. I crawled all night to get 
here. I want to die in this pool.” 

“In the water?” Tom said in 
surprise. 

“Yes, in the water. Don’t you un- 
derstand? I thought you would.” 
He stared up at the white tracing 
of the clouds in the sky. 

Tom waited, silently. He knelt 
there, the sun burning hot on his 
back. 

“I wanted to stay,” Willie said. 
“I had to stay. Didn’t you feel any- 
thing about this planet, Tom?” 

Tom thought a moment. “I did 
feel a little,” he admitted. “On the 
way over here. Like it would be a 
nice place to live.” 

“That’s it,” Willie smiled. “Don’t 
you see. Here was this planet, ripe 
for life, but without life. Then the 
seeds of the ferns got blown off 
Earth and drifted here. But it 
needed more, it needed animal life 
to complete the cycle. 

“Then we got ‘blown off Earth.’ 
Bart for the glory, Pudge for the 
ride, you for the excitement, and 
me — me — because I had to, I guess. 
Because I couldn’t stand it back 
there. Seeds, all four of us, and not 
knowing it. That’s why we had to 
land. That’s why one of us had to 

MIKE ELLIS 



86 




stay and I guess it was just me. 
Now the rest of you can go back to 
Earth.” 

Willie coughed, much longer this 
time. Then he lay back exhausted. 
“Tom,” he whispered, “look at the 
edge of my camp. In the ferns.” 

Tom walked over to the edge of 
the camp. He looked at the yellow- 
green ferns, wondering what Willie 
meant. Then he saw it. The faint 
steaming from the packed dead 
ferns under the growing ones, the 
spreading dark spot, the already 
darker green of the plants growing 
around the spot. 

Willie had brought the seeds of 
decay with him, as well as the seeds 
of life. The dead plants were de- 
caying for the first time on this 
planet. This spot would spread un- 
til the whole planet was covered 
with dark green; and life would be 
as it was on Earth. 

Tom went back to Willie and 
stood looking down at him. Then he 
knelt and gently closed Willie’s eye- 
lids. He thought of moving him, 
digging him a shallow grave. But 



kneeling there in the silent cove, he 
had the hunch that maybe there 
was more to this. Willie had wanted 
to stay in the little pool. The stream 
came down off the ridge through 
the pool to the sea. Maybe if Willie 
stayed there, the bacteria of his 
body would live on, and be washed 
into the sea. The water was warm 
and there were no enemies to de- 
stroy them and there were plants to 
feed them. Perhaps, Willie was 
right. Maybe he was the seed of life 
coming to this planet; and in a 
million years men might walk these 
shores. 

Tom straightened up. He took a 
deep breath and looked around the 
little cove, and then back to Willie. 

“It’s your planet, now, Willie. 
Willie’s Planet from now on. What 
Bart put in the log and what space- 
men will call it as they go by, will 
be two different things. Or did you 
know that in your heart, too.” He 
was silent a moment. “So long, 
Willie. Go with God.” 

He turned and crunched along 
the sand towards the ship. • • •

S ATURDAY morning, about 
eleven o’clock, Mrs. Edna Ber- 
thelson was ready to make her little 
trip. Although it was a weekly 
affair, consuming four hours of her 
valuable business time, she made 
the profitable trip alone, preserv- 
ing for herself the integrity of her 
find. 

Because that was what it was. A 
find, a stroke of incredible luck. 
There was nothing else like it, and 
she had been in business fifty- three 
years. More, if the years in her 
father’s store were counted — but 
they didn’t really count. That had 
been for the experience (her father 
made that clear) ; no pay was in- 
volved. But it gave her the under- 
standing of business, the feel of op- 
erating a small country store, dust- 
ing pencils and unwrapping fly 
paper and serving up dried beans 
and chasing the cat out of the 
cracker barrel where he liked to 
sleep. 

Now the store was old, and so 
was she. The big heavy-set, black- 
browed man who was her father 
had died long ago; her own chil- 
dren and grandchildren had been 



BY PHILIP K. DICK 



spawned, had Crept out over the 
world, were everywhere. One by 
one they had appeared, lived in 
Walnut Creek, sweated through 
the dry, sun-baked summers, and 
then gone on, leaving one by one 
as they had come. She and the 
store sagged and settled a little 
more each year; became a little 



more frail and stern and grim. A 
little more themselves. 

That morning very early Jackie 
said: “Grandmaw, where are you 
going?” Although he knew, of 
course, where she was going. She 
was going out in her truck as she 
always did; this was the Saturday 
trip. But he liked to ask; he was 
pleased by the stability of the an- 
swer. He liked having it always the 
same. 

To another question there was 
another unvarying answer, but this 
one didn’t please him so much. It 
came in answer to the question: 
“Can I come along?” 

The answer to that was always 
no. 

Edna Berthelson laboriously car- 
ried packages and boxes from the 
back of the store to the rusty, up- 
right pick-up truck. Dust lay over 
the truck; its red-metal sides were 
bent and corroded. The motor was 
already on; it was wheezing and 
heating up in the mid-day sun. A 
few drab chickens pecked in the 
dust around its wheels. Under the 
porch of the store a plump white 
shaggy sheep squatted, its face 
vapid, indolent, indifferently watch- 
ing the activity of the day. Cars 
and trucks rolled along Mount Di- 
ablo Boulevard. Along Lafayette 
Avenue a few shoppers strolled, 
farmers and their wives, petty bus- 
inessmen, farm hands, some city 
women in their gaudy slacks and 
print shirts, sandals, bandanas. In 
the front of the store the radio tin- 
nily played popular songs. 

“I asked you a question,” Jackie 
said righteously. “I asked you where 
you’re going.” 

Mrs. Berthelson bent stiffly over 
to lift the last armload of boxes. 



89 




Most of the loading had been done 
the night before by Arnie the 
Swede, the hulking white-haired 
hired-man who did the heavy work 
around the store. “What?” she 
murmured vaguely, her gray, 
wrinkled face twisting with concen- 
tration. “You know perfectly well 
where I’m going.” 

Jackie trailed plaintively after 
her, as she re-entered the store to 
look for her order book. “Can I 
come? Please, can I come along? 
You never let me come — you never 
let anybody come.” 

“Of course not,” Mrs. Berthelson 
said sharply. “It’s nobody’s busi- 
ness.” 

“But I want to come along,” 
Jackie explained. 

Slyly, the little old woman turned 
her gray head and peered back at 
him, a worn, colorless bird taking 
in a world perfectly understood. 
“So does everybody else.” Thin lips 
twitching in a secret smile, Mrs. 
Berthelson said softly: “But nobody 
can.” 

Jackie didn’t like the sound of 
that. Sullenly, he retired to a cor- 
ner, hands stuck deep in the pockets 
of his jeans, not taking part in 
something that was denied him, 
not approving of something in 
which he could not share. Mrs. 
Berthelson ignored him. She pulled 
her frayed blue sweater around her 
thin shoulders, located her sun- 
glasses, pulled the screen door shut 
after her, and strode briskly to the 
truck. 

Getting the truck into gear was 
an intricate process. For a time she 
sat tugging crossly at the shift, 
pumping the clutch up and down, 
waiting impatiently for the teeth to 
fall into place. At last, screeching 

90 



and chattering, the gears meshed; 
the truck leaped a little, and Mrs. 
Berthelson gunned the motor and 
released the hand brake. 

As the truck roared jerkily down 
the driveway, Jackie detached him- 
self from the shade by the house 
and followed along after it. His 
mother was nowhere in sight. Only 
the dozing sheep and the two 
scratching chickens were visible. 
Even Arnie the Swede was gone, 
probably getting a cold coke. Now 
was a fine time. Now was the best 
time he had ever had. And it was 
going to be sooner or later anyhow, 
because he was determined to come 
along. 

Grabbing hold of the tailboard of 
the truck, Jackie hoisted himself 
up and landed face-down on the 
tightly-packed heaps of packages 
and boxes. Under him the truck 
bounced and bumped. Jackie hung 
on for dear life; clutching at the 
boxes he pulled his legs under him, 
crouched down, and desperately 
sought to keep from being flung off. 
Gradually the truck righted itself, 
and the torque diminished. He 
breathed a sigh of relief and settled 
gratefully down. 

He was on his way. He was 
along, finally. Accompanying Mrs. 
Berthelson on her secret weekly 
trip, her strange covert enterprise 
from which — he had heard — she 
made a fabulous profit. A trip 
which nobody understood, and 
which he knew, in the deep recesses 
of his child’s mind, was something 
awesome and wonderful, something 
that would be well worth the 
trouble. 

He had hoped fervently that she 
wouldn’t stop to check her load 
along the way. 



PHILIP K. DICK 




ITH INFINITE care, Tell- 
man prepared himself a cup 
of “coffee”. First, he carried a tin 
cup of roasted grain over to the 
gasoline drum the colony used as 
a mixing bowl. Dumping it in, he 
hurried to add a handful of chic- 
ory and a few fragments of dried 
bran. Dirt-stained hands trem- 
bling, he managed to get a fire 
started among the ashes and coals 
under the pitted metal grate. He 
set a pan of tepid water on the 
flames and searched for a spoon. 

“What are you up to?” his wife 
demanded from behind him. 

“Uh,” Tellman muttered. Nerv- 
ously, he edged between Glady’s 
and the meal. “Just fooling 
around.” In spite of himself, his 
voice took on a nagging whine. “I 
have a right to fix myself something, 
don’t I? As much right as anybody 
else.” 

“You ought to be over helping.” 
“I was. -I wrenched something 
in my back.” The wiry middle- 
aged man ducked uneasily away 
from his wife; tugging at the re- 
mains of his soiled white shirt, he 
retreated toward the door of the 
shack. “Damn it, a person has to 
rest, sometimes.” 

“Rest when we get there.” 
Gladys wearily brushed back her 
thick dark-blonde hair. “Suppose 
everybody was like you.” 

Tellman flushed resentfully. 
“Who plotted our trajectory? Who’s 
done all the navigation work?” 

A faint ironic smile touched his 
wife’s chapped lips. “We’ll see how 
your charts work out,” she said. 
“Then we’ll talk about it.” 

Enraged, Tellman plunged out 
of the shack, into the blinding late- 
afternoon sunlight. 

CAPTIVE MARKET 



He hated the sun, the sterile 
white glare that began at five in 
the morning and lasted until nine 
in the evening. The Big Blast had 
sizzled the water vapor from the 
air; the sun beat down pitilessly, 
sparing nobody. But there were few 
left to care. 

To his right was the cluster of 
shacks that made up the camp. An 
eclectic hodge-podge of boards, 
sheets of tin, wire and tar paper, 
upright concrete blocks, anything 
and everything dragged from the 
San Francisco ruins, forty miles 
west. Cloth blankets flapped dis- 
mally in doorways, protection 
against the vast hosts of in- 
sects that swept across the camp 
site from time to time. Birds, the 
natural enemy of insects, were gone. 
Tellman hadn’t seen a bird in two 
years — and he didn’t expect to see 
one again. Beyond the camp began 
the eternal dead black ash, the 
charred face of the world, without 
features, without life. 

The camp had been set up in a 
natural hollow. One side was shel- 
tered by the tumbled ruins of what 
had once been a minor mountain 
range. The concussion of the blast 
had burst the towering cliffs; rock 
had cascaded into the valley for 
days. After San Francisco had been 
fired out of existence, survivors had 
crept into the heaps of boulders, 
looking for a place to hide from 
the sun. That was the hardest part : 
the unshielded sun. Not the insects, 
not the radio-active clouds of ash, 
not the flashing white fury of the 
blasts, but the sun. More people 
had died of thirst and dehydration 
and blind insanity than from toxic 
poisons. 

From his breast pocket, Tellman 

91 





got a precious package of cigarettes. 
Shakily, he lit up. His thin, claw- 
like hands, were trembling, partly 
from fatigue, partly from rage and 
tension. How he hated the camp. 
He loathed everybody in it, his wife 
included. Were they worth saving? 
He doubted it. Most of them were 
barbarians, already; what did it 
matter if they got the ship off or 
not? He was sweating away his 
mind and life, trying to save them. 
The hell with them. 

But then, his own safety was in- 
volved with theirs. 

He stalked stiff -legged over to 
where Barnes and Masterson stood 
talking. “How’s it coming?” he de- 
manded gruffly. 

“Fine,” Barnes answered. “It 
won’t be long, now.” 

“One more load,” Masterson 
said. His heavy features twitched 
uneasily. “I hope nothing gets 
fouled up. She ought to be here any 
minute.” 

Tellman loathed the sweaty, an- 
imal-like scent that rolled from 
Masterson’s beefy body. Their sit- 
uation wasn’t an excuse to creep 
around filthy as a pig ... on Venus, 
things would be different. Master- 
son was useful, now; he was an ex- 
perienced mechanic, invaluable in 
servicing the turbine and jets of 
the ship. But when the ship had 
landed and been pillaged . 

Satisfied, Tellman brooded over 
the re-establishment of the right- 
ful order. The hierarchy had col- 
lapsed in the ruins of the cities, but 
it would be back strong as ever. 
Take Flannery, for example. Flan- 
nery was nothing but a foul- 
mouthed shanty- Irish stevedor . 
but he was in charge of loading the 
ship, the greatest job at the mo- 



ment. Flannery was top dog, for 
the time being . but that would 
change. 

It had to change. Consoled, Tell- 
man strolled away from Barnes and 
Masterson, over to the ship itself. 

The ship was huge. Across its 
muzzle the stenciled identification 
still remained, not yet totally oblit- 
erated by drifting ash and the sear- 
ing heat of the sun. 

U. S. ARMY ORDINANCE 
SERIES A-3 (b) 

Originally, it had been a high- 
velocity “massive retaliation” wea- 
pon, loaded with an H-warhead, 
ready to carry indiscriminate death 
to the enemy. The projectile had 
never been launched. Soviet toxic 
crystals had blown quietly into the 
windows and doors of the local 
command barracks. When launch- 
ing day arrived, there was no crew 
to send it off. But it didn’t matter 
— there was no enemy, either. The 
rocket had stood on its buttocks for 
months ... it was still there when 
the first refugees straggled into the 
shelter of the demolished moun- 
tains. 

“Nice, isn’t it?” Patricia Shelby 
said. She glanced up from her work 
and smiled blearily at Tellman. Her 
small, pretty face was streaked with 
fatigue and eye-strain. “Sort of like 
the trylon at the New York World’s 
Fair.” 

“My God,” Tellman said, “you 
remember that?” 

“I was only eight,” Patricia an- 
swered. In the shadow of the ship 
she was carefully checking the 
automatic relays that would main- 
tain the air, temperature, and hum- 
idity of the ship. “But I’ll never for-

get it. Maybe I was a precog — 
when I saw it sticking up I knew 
someday it would mean a lot to 
everybody.” 

“A lot to the twenty of us/* Tell- 
man corrected. Suddenly he offered 
her the remains of his cigarette. 
“Here — you look like you could 
use it.” 

“Thanks.” Patricia continued 
with her work, the cigarette be- 
tween her lips. “I’m almost done — 
Boy, some of these relays are tiny. 
Just think.” She held up a micro- 
scopic wafer of transparent plastic. 
“While we’re all out cold, this 
makes the difference between life 
and death.” A strange, awed look 
crept into her dark-blue eyes. “To 
the human race.” 

Tellman guffawed. “You and 
Flannery. He’s always spouting 
idealistic twaddle.” 

Professor John Crowley, once 
head of the history department at 
Stanford, now the nominal leader 
of the colony, sat with Flannery 
and Jean Dobbs, examining the 
suppurating arm of a ten-year-old 
boy. “Radiation,” Crowley was say- 
ing emphatically. “The over-all 
level is rising daily. It’s settling ash 
that does it. If we don’t get out 
soon, we’re done.” 

“It’s not radiation,” Flannery 
corrected in his ultimately-certain 
voice. “It’s toxic crystalline poison- 
ing; that stuff’s knee-deep up in 
the hills. He’s been playing around 
up there.” 

“Is that so?” Jean Dobbs de- 
manded. The boy nodded his head 
not daring to look at her. “You’re 
right,” she said to Flannery. 

“Put some salve on it,” Flannery 
said. “And hope he’ll live. Outside 
of sulfathiazole there’s not much 



we have.” He glanced at his watch, 
suddenly tense. “Unless she brings 
the penicillin, today.” 

“If she doesn’t bring it today,” 
Crowley said, “she’ll never bring it. 
This is the last load ; as soon as it’s 
stored, we’re taking off.” 

Rubbing his hands, Flannery 
suddenly bellowed: “Then get out 
the money!” 

Crowley grinned. “Right.” He 
fumbled in one of the steel storage 
lockers and yanked out a handful 
of paper bills. Holding a sheaf of 
bills up to Tellman he fanned them 
out invitingly. “Take your pick. 
Take them all.” 

Nervously, Tellman said, “Be 
careful with that. She’s probably 
raised the price on everything, 
again.” 

“We’ve got plenty.” Flannery 
took some and stuffed it into a 
partly-filled load being wheeled by, 
on its way to the ship. “There’s 
money blowing all over the world, 
along with the ash and particles of 
bone. On Venus we won’t need it 
— she might as well have it all.” 
On Venus, Tellman thought, sav- 
agely, things would revert to their 
legitimate order — with Flannery 
digging sewers where he belonged. 
“What’s she bringing mostly?” 
he asked Crowley and Jean 
Dobbs, ignoring Flannery. “What’s 
the last load made up of?” 

“Comic books,” Flannery said 
dreamily, wiping perspiration from 
his balding forehead ; he was a lean, 
tall, dark-haired young man. “And 
harmonicas.” 

Crowley winked at him. “Uke 
picks, so we can lie in our ham- 
mocks all day, strumming Some- 
one’s in the Kitchen with Dinah.” 
“And swizzle sticks,” Flannery 

93

•v 




reminded him. “In order that we 
may all the more properly flatten 
the bubbles of our vintage ’38 
champagne.” 

Tellman boiled. “You — degen- 
erate!” 

Crowley and Flannery roared 
with laughter, and Tellman stalked 
off, smoldering under this new hu- 
miliation. What kind of morons and 
lunatics were they? Joking at a time 
like this ... he peered miserably, al- 
most accusingly, at the ship. Was 
this the kind of world they were 
going to found? 

In the pitiless white-hot sun, the 
huge ship shimmered and glowed. 
A vast upright tube of alloy and 
protective fiber mesh rising up 
above the tumble of wretched 
shacks. One more load, and they 
were off. One more truckful of sup- 
plies from their only source, the 
meager trickle of uncontaminated 
goods that meant the difference be- 
tween life and death. 

Praying that nothing would go 
wrong, Tellman turned to await 
the arrival of Mrs. Edna Berthelson 
and her battered red-pick-up truck. 
Their fragile umbilical cord, con- 
necting them with the opulent, un- 
damaged past. 

O N BOTH sides of the road lay 
groves of lush apricot trees. 
Bees and flies buzzed sleepily 
among the rotting fruit scattered 
over the soil; every now and then a 
roadside stand appeared, operated 
by somnambulistic children. In 
driveways stood parked Buicks and 
Oldsmobiles. Rural dogs wandered 
here and there. At one intersection 
stood a swank tavern, its neon sign 
blinking on and off, ghostly pale 

94 



in the mid-morning sun. 

Mrs. Edna Berthelson glared hos- 
tilely at the tavern, and at the cars 
parked around it. City people 
were moving out into the valley, 
cutting down the old oak trees, the 
ancient fruit orchards, setting up 
suburban homes, stopping in the 
middle of the day for a whiskey 
sour and then driving cheerfully 
on. Driving at seventy-five miles an 
hour in their swept-back Chryslers. 
A column of cars that had piled up 
behind her truck suddenly burst 
forth and swung past her. She let 
them go, stony-faced, indifferent. 
Served them right for being in 
such a hurry. If she always hurried 
like that, she would never have 
had time to pay attention to 
that odd ability she had found 
in her introspective, lonely drives; 
never have discovered that she 
could look “ahead”, never have 
discovered that hole in the warp of 
time which enabled her to trade so 
easily at her own exorbitant prices. 
Let them hurry if they wanted. The 
heavy load in the back of the truck 
jogged rhythmically. The motor 
wheezed. Against the back window 
a half-dead fly buzzed. 

Jackie lay stretched out among 
the cartons and boxes, enjoying 
the ride, gazing complacently at 
the apricot trees and cars. Against 
the hot sky the peak of Mount Di- 
ablo rose, blue and white, an ex- 
panse of cold rock. Trails of mist 
clung to the peak; Mount Diablo 
went a long way up. He made a 
face at a dog standing indolently at 
the side of the road, waiting to 
cross. He waved gaily at a Pacific 
Telephone Co. repairman, string- 
ing wire from a huge reel. 

Abruptly the truck turned off the 

PHILIP K. DICK 




state highway and onto a black-sur- 
faced side road. Now there were 
fewer cars. The truck began to 
climb . the rich orchards fell be- 
hind and gave way to flat brown 
fields. A dilapidated farm house lay 
to the right; he watched it with 
interest, wondering how old it was. 
When it was out of sight, no other 
man-made structures followed. The 
fields became unkempt. Broken, 
sagging fences were visible occa- 
sionally. Torn signs, no longer leg- 
ible. The truck was approaching 
the base of Mount Diablo ... al- 
most nobody came this way. 

Idly, the boy wondered why Mrs. 
Berthelson’s little trip took her in 
this direction. Nobody lived here; 
suddenly there were no fields, only 
scrub grass and bushes, wild coun- 
tryside, the tumbled slope of the 
mountain. A rabbit hopped skill- 
fully across the half-decayed road. 
Rolling hills, a broad expanse of 
trees and strewn boulders . 
there was nothing here but a State 
fire tower, and maybe a water shed. 
And an abandoned picnic area, 
once maintained by the State, now 
forgotten. 

An edge of fear touched the boy. 
No customers lived out this way 
... he had been positive the bat- 
tered red pick-up truck would head 
directly into town, take him and 
the load to San Francisco or Oak- 
land or Berkeley, a city where he 
could get out and run around, see 
interesting sights. There was noth- 
ing here, only abandoned empti- 
ness, silent and foreboding. In the 
shadow of the mountain, the air 
was chill. He shivered. All at once 
he wished he hadn’t come. 

Mrs. Berthelson slowed the truck 
and shifted noisily into low. With a 

CAPTIVE MARKET 



roar and an explosive belch of ex- 
haust gasses, the truck crept up a 
steep ascent, among jagged boul- 
ders, ominous and sharp. Some- 
where far off a bird cried shrilly; 
Jackie listened to its thin sounds 
echoing dismally away and won- 
dered how he could attract his 
grandmother’s attention. It would 
be nice to be in front, in the cabin. 
It would be nice — 

And then he noticed it. At first 
he didn’t believe it . but he had 
to believe it. 

Under him, the truck was begin- 
ning to fade away. 

It faded slowly, almost imper- 
ceptibly. Dimmer and dimmer the 
truck grew; its rusty red sides be- 
came gray, then colorless. The 
black road was visible underneath. 
In wild panic, the boy clutched 
at the piles of boxes. His hands 
passed through them; he was rid- 
ing precariously on an uneven sea 
of dim shapes, among almost in- 
visible phantoms. 

He lurched and slid down. Now 
— hideously — he was suspended 

momentarily half-way through the 
truck, just above the tail pipe. 
Groping desperately, he struggled 
to catch hold of the boxes directly 
above him. “Help!” he shouted. 
His voice echoed around him; it 
was the only sound . the roar 
of the truck was fading. For a mo- 
ment he clutched at the retreating 
shape of the truck; then, gently, 
gradually, the last image of the 
truck faded, and with a sickening 
crunch, the boy dropped to the 
road. 

The impact sent him rolling into 
the dry weeds beyond the drain- 
age ditch. Stunned, dazed with dis- 
belief and pain, he lay gasping, try- 

95 




ing feebly to pull himself up. There 
was only silence; the truck, Mrs. 
Berthelson, had vanished. He was 
totally alone. He closed his eyes 
and lay back, stupefied with fright. 

Sometime later, probably not 
much later, he was aroused by the 
squeal of brakes. A dirty, orange 
State maintenance truck had 
lurched to a stop; two men in 
khaki work clothes were climbing 
down and hurrying over. 

“What’s the matter?” one yelled 
at him. They grabbed him up, faces 
serious and alarmed. “What are 
you doing here?” 

“Fell,” he muttered. “Off the 
truck.” 

“What truck?” they demanded. 
“How?” 

He couldn’t tell them. All he 
knew was that Mrs. Berthelson had 
gone. He hadn’t made it, after all. 
Once again, she was making her 
trip alone. He would never know' 
where she went; he would never 
find out who her customers were. 



G RIPPING the steering wheel 
of the truck, Mrs. Berthelson 
was conscious that the transition 
had taken place. Vaguely, she was 
aware that the rolling brown fields, 
rocks and green scrub bushes, had 
faded out. The first time she had 
gone “ahead” she had found the 
old truck floundering in a sea of 
black ash. She had been so excited 
by her discovery that day that she 
had neglected to “scan” conditions 
on the other side of the hole. She 
had known there were customers 
. and dashed headlong through 
the warp to get there first. She 
smiled complacently . she 
needn’t have hurried, there was no 



competition here. In fact, the cus- 
tomers were so eager to deal with 
her, they had done virtually every- 
thing in their power to make things 
easier for her. 

The men had built a crude strip 
of road out into the ash, a sort of 
wooden platform onto which the 
truck now rolled. She had learned 
the exact moment to “go ahead”; 
it was the instant that the truck 
passed the drainage culvert a quar- 
ter mile inside the State park. Here, 
“ahead”, the culvert also existed 
. but there was little left of it, 
only a vague jumble of shattered 
stone. And the road was utterly 
buried. 

Under the wheels of the truck 
the rough boards thumped and 
banged. It would be bad if she had 
a flat tire . but some of them 
could fix it. They were always 
working; one little additional task 
wouldn’t make much difference. 
She could see them, now; they 
stood at the end of the wooden 
platform, waiting impatiently for 
her. Beyond them was their jumble 
of crude, smelly shacks, and be- 
yond that, their ship. 

A lot she cared about their ship. 
She knew what it was : stolen Army 
property. Setting her bony hand 
rigidly around the gearshift knob, 
she threw the truck into neutral 
and coasted to a stop. As the men 
approached, she began pulling on 
the hand brake. 

“Afternoon,” Professor Crowley 
muttered, his eyes sharp and keen 
as he peered eagerly into the back 
of the truck. 

Mrs. Berthelson grunted a non- 
committal answer. She didn’t like 
any of them . dirty men, smell- 
ing of sweat and fear, their bodies

and clothes streaked with grime, 
and the ancient coating of des- 
peration that never seemed to leave 
them. Like awed, pitiful children 
they clustered around the truck, 
poking hopefully at the packages, 
already beginning to pluck them 
out onto the black ground. 

“Here, now,” she said sharply. 
“You leave those alone.” 

Their hands darted back as if 
seared. Mrs. Berthelson sternly 
climbed from the truck, grabbed 
up her inventory sheet, and 
plodded up to Crowley. 

“You just wait,” she told him. 
“Those have to be checked off.” 

He nodded, glanced at Master- 
son, licked his dry lips, and waited. 
They all waited. It had always 
been that way; they knew, and she 
knew, that there was no other way 
they could get their supplies. And 
if they didn’t get their supplies, 
their food and medicine and cloth- 
ing and instruments and tools and 
raw materials, they wouldn’t be 
able to leave in their ship. 

In this world, in the “ahead”, 
such things didn’t exist. At least, 
not so anybody could use them. A 
cursory glance had told her that; 
she could see the ruin with her own 
eyes. They hadn’t taken very good 
care of their world. They had 
wasted it all, turned it into black 
ash and ruin. Well, it was their 
business, not hers. 

She had never been much inter- 
ested in the relationship between 
their world and hers. She was con- 
tent to know that both existed, and 
that she could go from one to the 
other and back. And she was the 
only one who knew how. Several 
times, people from this world, 
members of this group, had tried 

CAPTIVE MARKET 



to go “back there” with her. It 
had always failed. As she made 
the transition, they were left be- 
hind. It was her power, her faculty. 
Not a shared faculty — she was glad 
of that. And for a person in busi- 
ness, quite a valuable faculty. 

“All right,” she said crisply. 
Standing where she could keep her 
eye on them, she began checking 
off each box as it was carried from 
the truck. Her routine was exact 
and certain; it was a part of her 
life. As long as she could remember 
she had transacted business in a 
distinct way. Her father had taught 
her how to live in a business world ; 
she had learned his stern principles 
and rules. She was following them 
now. 

Flannery and Patricia Shelby 
stood together at one side; Flan- 
nery held the money, payment for 
the delivery. “Well,” he said, under 
his breath, “now we can tell her 
to go leap in the river.” 

“Are you sure?” Pat asked nerv- 
ously. 

“The last load’s here.” Flannery 
grinned starkly and ran a trem- 
bling hand through his thinning 
black hair. “Now we can get roll- 
ing. With this stuff, the ship’s 
crammed to the gills. We may even 
have to sit down and eat some of 
that now ” He indicated a bulging 
paste-board carton of groceries. 
“Bacon, eggs, milk, real coffee. 
Maybe we won’t shove it in deep- 
freeze. Maybe we ought to have a 
last-meal-before-the-flight orgy.” 
Wistfully, Pat said, “It would 
be nice. It’s been a long time since 
we’ve had food like that.” 

Masterson strode over. “Let’s 
kill her and boil her in a big kettle. 
Skinny old witch — she might make 

97 




good soup.” 

“In the oven,” Flannery cor- 
rected. “Some gingerbread, to take 
along with us.” 

“I wish you wouldn’t talk like 
that,” Pat said apprehensively. 
“She’s so — well, maybe she is a 
witch. I mean, maybe that’s what 
witches were . old women with 
strange talents. Like her — being 
able to pass through time.” 

“Damn lucky for us,” Masterson 
said briefly. 

“But she doesn’t understand it. 
Does she? Does she know what 
she’s doing? That she could save 
us all this by sharing her ability.” 
Does she know what’s happened to 
our world? 

Flannery considered. “Probably 
she doesn’t know — or care. A mind 
like hers, business and profit — 
getting exorbitant rates from us, 
selling this stuff to us at an in- 
credible premium. And the joke 
is that money’s worth nothing to 
us. If she could see, she’d know 
that. It’s just paper, in this world. 
But she’s caught in a narrow little 
routine. Business, profit.” He shook 
his head. “A mind like that, a 
warped, miserable flea-sized mind 
. and she has that unique talent.” 

“But she can see ” Pat persisted. 
“She can see the ash, the ruin. 
How can she not know?” 

Flannery shrugged. “She prob- 
ably doesn’t connect it with her 
own life. After all, she’ll be dead 
in a couple of years . she won’t 
see the war in her real time. She’ll 
only see it this way, as a region into 
which she can travel. A sort of 
travelogue of strange lands. She 
can enter and leave — but we’re 
stuck. It must give you a damn fine 
sense of security to be able to walk 

98 



out of one world, into another. 
God, what I’d give to be able to go 
back with her.” 

“It’s been tried,” Masterson 
pointed out. “That lizard-head Tell- 
man tried it. And he came walking 
back , covered with ash. He said 
the truck faded out.” 

“Of course it did,” Flannery said 
mildly. “She drove it back to Wal- 
nut Creek. Back to 1955.” 

The unloading had been com- 
pleted. The members of the colony 
were toiling up the slope, lugging 
the cartons to the check-area be- 
neath the ship. Mrs. Berthelson 
strode over to Flannery, accom- 
panied by Professor Crowley. 

“Here’s the inventory,” she said 
briskly. “A few items couldn’t be 
found. You know, I don’t stock all 
that in my store. I have to send out 
for most of it.” 

“We know,” Flannery said, cold- 
ly amused. It would be interesting 
to see a country store that stocked 
binocular microscopes, turret lathes, 
frozen packs of anti-biotics, high- 
frequency radio transmitters, ad- 
vanced text books in all fields. 

“So that’s why I have to charge 
you a little dearer,” the old woman 
continued, the inflexible routine of 
squeeze. “On items I bring in — ” 
She examined her inventory, then 
returned the ten-page typewritten 
list that Crowley had given her on 
the previous visit. “Some of these 
weren’t available. I marked them 
back order. That bunch of metals 
from those laboratories back East — 
they said maybe later.” A cunning 
look slid over the ancient gray eyes. 
“And they’ll be very expensive.” 
“It doesn’t matter,” Flannery 
said, handing her the money. “You 
can cancel all the back orders.” 

PHILIP K. DICK 




At first her face showed nothing. 
Only a vague inability to under- 
stand. 

“No more shipments/* Crowley 
explained. A certain tension faded 
from them; for the first time, they 
weren’t afraid of her. The old re- 
lationship had ended. They weren’t 
dependent on the rusty red truck. 
They had their shipment; they 
were ready to leave. 

“We’re taking off,” Flannery 
said, grinning starkly. “We’re full 
up.” 

Comprehension came. “But I 
placed orders for those things.” 
Her voice was thin, bleak. Without 
emotion. “They’ll be shipped to 
me. I’ll have to pay for them.” 

“Well,” Flannery said softly, 
“isn’t that too damn bad.” 

Crowley shot him a warning 
glance. “Sorry,” he said to the old 
woman. “We can’t stick around — 
this place is getting hot. We’ve got 
to take off.” 

On the withered face, dismay 
turned to growing wrath. “You or- 
dered those things! You have to 
take them!” Her shrill voice rose 
to a screech of fury. “What am I 
supposed to do with them?” 

As Flannery framed his bitter 
answer, Pat Shelby intervened. 
“Mrs. Berthelson,” she said quiet- 
ly, “you’ve done a lot for us, even 
if you wouldn’t help us through 
the hole into your time. And we’re 
very grateful. If it wasn’t for you, 
we couldn’t have got together 
enough supplies. But we really have 
to go.” She reached out her hand 
to touch the frail shoulder, but the 
old woman jerked furiously away. 
“I mean,” Pat finished awkward- 
ly, “we can’t stay any longer, 
whether we want to or not. Do you 

CAPTIVE MARKET 



see all that black ash? It’s radio- 
active, and more of it sifts down all 
the time. The toxic level is rising — 
if we stay any longer it’ll start de- 
stroying us.” 

Mrs. Edna Berthelson stood 
clutching her inventory list. There 
was an expression on her face that 
none of the group had ever seen 
before. The violent spasm of wrath 
had vanished; now a cold, chill 
glaze lay over the aged features. 
Her eyes were like gray rocks, utter- 
ly without feeling. 

Flannery wasn’t impressed. 
“Here’s your loot,” he said, thrust- 
ing out the handful of bills. “What 
the hell.” He turned to Crowley. 
“Let’s toss in the rest. Let’s stuff it 
down her goddamn throat.” 

“Shut up,” Crowley snapped. 
Flannery sank resentfully back. 
“Who are you talking to?” 

“Enough’s enough.” Crowley, 
worried and tense, tried to speak 
to the old woman. “My God, you 
can’t expect us to stay around here 
forever, can you?” 

There was no response. Abrupt- 
ly, the old woman turned and 
strode silently back to her truck. 

Masterson and Crowley looked 
uneasily at each other. “She sure is 
mad,” Masterson said apprehen- 
sively. 

Tellman hurried up, glanced at 
the old woman getting into her 
truck, and then bent down to root 
around in one of the cartons of 
groceries. Childish greed flushed 
across his thin face. “Look,” he 
gasped. “Coffee — fifteen pounds of 
it. Can we open some? Can we get 
one tin open, to celebrate?” 
“Sure,” Crowley said tonelessly, 
his eyes on the truck. With a 
muffleid roar, the truck turned in a 

99 




wide arc and rumbled off down 
the crude platform, toward the 
ash. It rolled off into the ash, 
slithered for a short distance, and 
then faded out. Only the bleak, 
sun-swept plain of darkness re- 
mained. 

“Coffee ! 55 Tellman shouted glee- 
fully. He tossed the bright metal 
can high in the air and clumsily 
caught it again. “A celebration! 
Our last night — last meal on 
Earth ! 55 



WAS true. 

As the red pick-up truck 
jogged metallically along the road, 
Mrs. Berthelson scanned “ahead 55 
and saw that the men were telling 
the truth. Her thin lips writhed; in 
her mouth an acid taste of bile 
rose. She had taken it for granted 
that they would continue to buy — 
there was no competition, no other 
source of supply. But they were 
leaving. And when they left, there 
would be no more market. 

She would never find a market 
that satisfactory. It was a perfect 
market; the group was a perfect 
customer. In the locked box at the 
back of the store, hidden down un- 
der the reserve sacks of grain, was 
almost two hundred and fifty thou- 
sand dollars. A fortune, taken in 
over the months, received from 
the imprisoned colony as it toiled 
to construct its ship. 

And she had made it possible. 
She was responsible for letting 
them get away after all. Because of 
her short-sightedness, they were 
able to escape. She hadn’t used her 
head. 

As she drove back to town she 
meditated calmly, rationally. It 

100 



was totally because of her: she was 
the only one who had possessed the 
power to bring them their supplies. 
Without her, they were helpless. 

Hopefully, she cast about, look- 
ing this way and that, peering with 
her deep inner sense, into the vari- 
ous “aheads 55 . There was more 
than one, of course. The “aheads 55 
lay like a pattern of squares, an in- 
tricate web of worlds into which 
she could step, if she cared. But all 
were empty of what she wanted. 

All showed bleak plains of black 
ash, devoid of human habitation. 
What she wanted was lacking: 
they were each without customers. 

The pattern of “aheads 55 was 
complex. Sequences were con- 
nected like beads on a string; there 
were chains of “aheads 55 which 
formed interwoven links. One step 
led to the next . but not to alter- 
nate chains. 

Carefully, with great precision, 
she began the job of searching 
through each of the chains. There 
were many of them ... a virtual in- 
finity of possible “aheads 55 . And it 
was her power to select; she had 
stepped into that one, the particu- 
lar chain in which the huddled col- 
ony had labored to construct its 
ship. She had, by entering it, made 
it manifest. Frozen it into reality. 
Dredged it up from among the 
many, from among the multitude 
of possibilities. 

Now she needed to dredge an- 
other. That particular “ahead 55 had 
proven unsatisfactory. The market 
had petered out. 

The truck was entering the 
pleasant town of Walnut Creek, 
passing bright stores and houses 
and supermarkets, before she lo- 
cated it. There were so many, and 

PHILIP K. DICK 





her mind was old . but now she 
had picked it out. And as soon as 
she found it, she knew it was the 
one. Her innate business instinct 
certified it; the particular “ahead” 
clicked. 

Of the possibilities, this one was 
unique. The ship was well-built, 
and thoroughly tested. In “ahead” 
after “ahead” the ship rose, hesi- 
tated as automatic machinery 
locked, and then burst from the 
jacket of atmosphere, toward the 
morning star. In a few “aheads”, 
wasted sequences of failure, the 
ship exploded into white-hot frag- 
ments. Those, she ignored; she saw 
no advantage in that. 

In a few “aheads” the ship failed 
to take off at all. The turbines 
lashed ; exhaust poured out . and 
the ship remained as it was. But 
then the men scampered out and 
began going over the turbines, 
searching for the faulty parts. So 
nothing was gained. In later seg- 
ments along the chain, in subse- 
quent links, the damage was re- 
paired, and the take-off was satis- 
factorily completed. 

But one chain was correct. Each 
element, each link, developed per- 
fectly. The pressure-locks closed, 
and the ship was sealed. The tur- 
bines fired, and the ship, with a 
shudder, rose from the plain of 
black ash. Three miles up, the rear 
jets tore loose. The ship floundered, 
dropped in a screaming dive, and 
plunged back toward the Earth. 
Emergency landing jets, designed 
for Venus, were frantically thrown 
on. The ship slowed, hovered for an 
agonizing instant, and then crashed 
into the heap of rubble that had 
been Mount Diablo. There the re- 
mains of the ship lay, twisted metal

sheets, smoking in the dismal 
silence. 

From the ship the men emerged, 
shaken and mute, to inspect the 
damage. To begin the miserable, 
futile task all over again. Collect- 
ing supplies, patching the rocket 
up . the old woman smiled to 
herself. 

That was what she wanted. That 
would do perfectly. And all she had 
to do — such a little thing — was 
select that sequence when she made 
her next trip. When she took her 
little business trip, the following 
Saturday. 

C ROWLEY lay half buried in 
the black ash, pawing feebly at 
a deep gash in his cheek. A broken 
tooth throbbed. A thick ooze of 
blood dripped into his mouth, the 
hot salty taste of his own body- 
fluids leaking helplessly out. He 
tried to move his leg, but there was 
no sensation. Broken. His mind was 
too dazed, too bewildered with 
despair, to comprehend. 

Somewhere in the half-darkness, 
Flannery stirred. A woman 
groaned; scattered among the 
rocks and buckled sections of the 
ship lay the injured and dying. An 
upright shape rose, stumbled, and 
pitched over. An artificial light 
flickered. It was Tellman, making 
his way clumsily over the tattered 
remains of their world. He gaped 
foolishly at Crowley; his glasses 
hung from one ear and part of his 
lower jaw was missing. Abruptly 
he collapsed face-forward into a 
smoking mound of supplies. His 
skinny body twitched aimlessly. 

Crowley managed to pull him- 
self to his knees. Masterson was 

101 




bending over him, saying some- 
thing again and again. 

“I’m all right,” Crowley rasped. 

“We’re down. Wrecked.” 

“I know.” 

On Masterson’s shattered face 
glittered the first stirrings of hys- 
teria. “Do you think — ” 

“No,” Crowley muttered. “It 
isn’t possible.” 

Masterson began to giggle. Tears 
streaked the grime of his cheeks; 
drops of thick moisture dripped 
down his neck into his charred 



collar. “She did it. She fixed us. 
She wants us to stay here.” 

“No,” Crowley repeated. He 
shut out the thought. It couldn’t 
be. It just couldn’t. “We’ll get 
away,” he said. “We’ll assemble 
the remains — start over.” 

“She’ll be back,” Masterson 
quavered. “She knows we’ll be here 
waiting for her. Customers!” 

“No,” Crowley said. He didn’t 
believe it; he made himself not be- 
lieve it. “We’ll get away. We’ve 
got to get away!” • • •

WORTHCITING 

| Millions of families in undeveloped areas may soon be enjoying | 
| a better standard of living because of a new solar stove which is | 

| now being developed and tested. Experts hail it as a new eco- | 

| nomic force, since the use of vegetation and animal dung as fuel, | 

| which is prevalent in many of these areas, has caused soil erosion, | 

| deforestation and cut productivity of the soil by at least one-half. | 

1 Although the idea of a solar cooker is not a new one, this latest 1 
| entry is far more practical than most of the others for several 1 

| reasons. The cooker eliminates the use of parabolic reflectors | 

1 which are very expensive, and has the advantage of retaining heat 1 

| for an hour or more after the sun has set. Preliminary models 1 

1 have developed temperatures of 300 degrees F. on days when § 

| the outdoor temperature was less than 70 degrees, and have also 1 

1 produced heat sufficient for cooking on comparatively cloudy 1 

1 days. Researchers believe that the solar stove will probably sell for | 

| as little as $5.00 when it is mass produced, a price that is within 1 

| the financial grasp of about 100,000,000 potential users in India 1 
1 alone. | 

| Our citation this month goes to Dr. Maria Telkes, of New York 1 
1 University, the inventor of the solar cooker; and to the Ford | 

1 Foundation whose grant made the research program possible — 1 

1 so that sunshine “fuel” will be available to millions of people | 

1 where stoves and even the cheapest fuels are often too expensive. 1

Being a world unto one’s self is lonely. Even the 
poor amoeba creature from Venus knew that . 

ESCAPE MECHANISM 

BY CHARLES E. FRITCH 

Illustrated by Paul Orban 

104 



S HE FOUND herself floating 
again in that strange half-fa- 
miliar world of murky fluid where 
only she existed. The liquid was all 
around her, pressing gently on all 
sides with a force that cushioned 
but did not restrain. It was a pleas- 
ant sensation, a calming one; the 
cares of the outside world were 
non-existent and therefore mean- 
ingless. 

She drifted, unhampered by the 
fluid. There seemed to be no direc- 
tion but outward. Her thoughts 
went out and they returned with 
impressions. 

This was her world and she was 
the center of it. It pleased her to 
think this. It was an alien pleasure 
that was mental and without physi- 
cal counterpart 

There was quiet, stillness, a peace 
she had never known. The fluid 
flowed about her like a great silent 
sea that held no sound, no move- 
ment. 

It seemed natural that she should 
be here. 

She was content. 

At the accustomed time, the auto- 
hypnotics in Miss Abby Martin’s 
body forced her to the threshold 
of consciousness and cleared her 
brain of the fog of sleep. Slowly, 
she opened her eyes to the morn- 
ing brightness of her bedroom and 
stared at the vacant skylight and 
the blue expanse of sky beyond it, 
not quite comprehending where 
she was. The cloudfoam cushions 
of her bed gave credence to the 
floating sensation she had had dur- 
ing her dream, and for a few sec- 
onds she lacked orientation. 

Then her eyes wandered about 
the room, to the closed door of the 



raybath stall, the retracted dressing 
table, the chronometer label that 
told her it was March 14, 2123 at 
thirty seconds past 0700 hours. The 
subtle intonation of her favorite 
music, Gzerdon’s “Maze of Crystal” 
murmured sofdy from the walls. 

Awareness came then, and she 
lay back on the bed and tried to 
follow the intricate crystal melo- 
dies. But a frown ridged her brow, 
and she wondered at the strange 
dream instead. She had found it 
pleasant enough, for she rather en- 
joyed the languid floating sensation, 
the feeling of being self-sufficient, 
a world unto herself. Yet the very 
fact of the dream’s existence in a 
world where such things were 
manufactured disturbed her, for 
she had taken no dreampills the 
night before, nor at any of die other 
times the dream had come. The 
incident made her almost wish that 
witchdoctor psychiatrics had not 
been outlawed twenty years ago, so 
she might get some inkling of the 
dream’s meaning; but psychiatrists 
had been pulled forcibly from the 
web of society when mental de- 
rangements were put under the 
jurisdiction of the Somaticists. 

Overhead, a rocket thundered, 
shaking the house with a gentle 
hand, and Abby turned her atten- 
tion to the sound, momentarily for- 
getting the dream. Through the 
one-way skylight, she saw a speck 
of light accelerate beyond vision. 
She shook her head impatiently. 

Rush, rush, rush — that was all 
people seemed to think about these 
days. Go to the Moon, go to Mars, 
go to Venus. In time they might go 
to the outer planets and perhaps 
even try to reach the stars. As 
though they didn’t have enough 



105 




trouble right here on Earth! All 
they did, it seemed, was hunt down 
poor beasts from the various planets 
and bring them back to Earth to 
put in cages and tanks on display, 
ostensibly to “learn more of the 
planets by studying their inhab- 
itants.” To Abby, it seemed cruel 
and unnecessary. 

Like that poor amoeba creature 
from Venus, she thought, remem- 
bering the day last week when she 
and her niece Linda had visited 
the zoo to see this latest acquisition. 
It was a creature captured from the 
giant oceans of the second planet, 
a giant amoeba encased in a large 
transparent tank of murky fluid for 
paying visitors to see. The creature 
was supposed to be primitively tele- 
pathic, but it seemed harmless 
enough. Abby found herself sym- 
pathizing with it, and it seemed to 
her at the time that the creature 
felt this sympathy and was grate- 
ful for it. For a brief moment she 
even had fancied that the Venus- 
ian’s mind had reached out to her, 
probing with gentle fingers of 
thought. 

She shook her head at that. Here 
in the calm clear light of day dif- 
fused through the one-way sky- 
light, the anthropomorphic notion 
was ridiculous; and she mentally 
chided herself for contemplating 
such things. 

“I must be getting old,” she told 
herself aloud. 

In the next thought, she re- 
minded herself that thirty-nine 
years was not old at all, and in the 
thought that followed, scolded her- 
self for bothering to defend a state- 
ment so obviously rhetorical. 

The chronometer ticked silently 
to 0701, and sighing, Abby rose 

106 



from the bed and slipped from the 
translucent one-piece pajamas to 
stand nude in the center of the bed- 
room. At a sudden thought she 
glanced quickly about the room, for 
she had the strange uncomfortable 
feeling that someone was watching 
her. It was impossible, of course, 
but she felt ill-at-ease just the same, 
and a blush of embarrassment stole 
over her at the thought. The feel- 
ing of shameful nakedness per- 
sisted even in the raybath stall, and 
it was a relief to dress and hurry 
downstairs, routing the unaccount- 
able ideas from her mind. 

As usual, Gretchen had busily 
cleaned the house during the night, 
silently raying germs and dirt out 
of existence, and had a warm 
steaming breakfast-for-two ready 
by the time Abby had descended 
the escalator to the dining room. 

“Good morning, Gretchen,” 
Abby said. 

“Good morning, Ma’m,” Gretch- 
en’s mechanical voice agreed tone- 
lessly. The robot-maid continued 
monotonously, “The day will be 
clear and sunny, with a high of 79 
degrees Fahrenheit by 1300 
hours — ” 

“That will be all, Gretchen,” 
Abby interrupted sternly, not inter- 
ested in facts of temperature and 
humidity given so mercilessly. 

“Yes, Ma’m,” Gretchen said ob- 
ligingly. She turned and went to 
her closet until she would be needed 
again. 

Abby watched her disappear 
around a corner and frowned. 
Sometimes, she thought, the me- 
chanical age could be too mechani- 
cal. A simple good morning — 

“Good morning, Aunt Abby,” 
Linda said, bounding into sight. 

CHARLES E. FRITCH 




“Good morning, Linda,” Abby 
replied, smiling at the girl’s energy. 
It reminded her of when she was 
seventeen. “Don’t rush your break- 
fast, dear, you’ve plenty of time to 
get to school.” 

“Yes, Aunt Abby,” Linda said, 
rushing her breakfast. “We’re go- 
ing on a field trip today,” she vol- 
unteered between gulps of milk. 
“To the zoo to see the amoebaman 
from Venus.” 

Abby smiled. “Amoebaman?” 
she questioned. “Couldn’t it just as 
easily be an amoeba woman?” 

“Amoebas don’t have sex differ- 
ences,” Linda said matter-of-factly. 
“We just call it an amoebaman as 
a sort of classification because it 
seems intelligent.” 

She finished her meal and dashed 
across the room. “See you later, 
Aunt Abby.” The door whirred 
open and shut. 

Abby went to the window to 
watch her, sorry she had brought 
up the subject of sex classification; 
yet the question had started out 
harmlessly enough. Waiting 
outside, a boy stood on an island 
among moving metal sidewalks. 
Abby recognized him as one who 
had ’vised Linda very often on 
questions of homework. At Linda’s 
approach his eyes took new life, 
and he laughed a greeting. To- 
gether, they stepped onto a side- 
walk and slowly wound from sight, 
their hands interlocked. Abby 
shook her head disapprovingly; this 
would have to be discouraged. 
Linda was much too young to have 
boyfriends. She shook her head. 
The younger generation never 
seemed to move slowly — they 
rushed their lives away. 

ESCAPE MECHANISM 



T HAT afternoon, Abby sat at 
the broad one-way windows 
and watched the cars and aircabs 
zooming overhead like frightened 
hornets. Suddenly, she wondered 
where Dr. Gower was these days. 
Generally he televised her once in 
a while or dropped in to chat oc- 
casionally, and it pleased her that 
he did. He was her only male com- 
panion these days. 

That’s the way with men, she 
thought bitterly, nodding to her- 
self, as you grow old, they lose in- 
terest in you. Love cannot be 
founded on a physical basis. 

The thought of physical intimacy 
disturbed her, and she thrust it 
aside. One thing was certain, above 
all else : she was determined to pro- 
tect Linda to the best of her abil- 
ity, even as she had protected her- 
self. 

“Thank goodness for Linda,” 
she thought. “If it weren’t for 
her. 

She let the thought hang uncon- 
templated, for she did have Linda; 
and she had no wish to dwell upon 
the memory of her brother’s acci- 
dental death in an aircab crash 
which had brought Linda into her 
custody. 

She returned her attention to the 
world outside her window and 
found nothing there to interest her. 
Restlessly, she played with the but- 
ton-controls on the chair’s under- 
arm, causing the walls to spring 
into the simulated life of a three- 
dimensional telecast. A program 
called “Old-Time Commercial” 
was in progress. Abby, like most 
people, enjoyed this one, laughing 
at the exaggerated claims and the 
tuneless melodies which had been 
foisted upon her ancestors during 

107 




the years before commercials had 
been outlawed, and she was disap- 
pointed to see it fade for channel 
identification. It was followed by 
a program of the latest fashions, 
some of which were much too 
brazen for Abby to contemplate 
without squirming, so she changed 
stations again with a flick of her 
forefinger beneath the armrest. 

“. direct from the oceans of 
Venus,” a man’s voice announced 
enthusiastically, and Abby found 
herself staring at the amoeba-like 
creature she had seen a week earlier 
at the zoo. 

. believed to be directly re- 
lated to our own Earth amoeba,” 
the man continued, “except, of 
course, this one is far from micro- 
scopic, being larger than a man. 
For communication purposes, these 
Venusian creatures seem to use a 
form of telepathy. .” 

Abby mused upon what Linda 
had said concerning the amoeba’s 
sex, or rather lack of it. She knew 
that the creatures reproduced by 
dividing themselves, but she won- 
dered if reproduction came instinc- 
tively or by determination. Either 
way, the method was to be admired, 
she felt. It was a pity humans were 
so complicated. An image stirred 
deep within her, a fragment of some 
forgotten memory, but Abby did 
not notice it. 

The creature from Venus moved 
restlessly across the three dimen- 
sional screen, extending itself. It 
seemed to be regarding her with 
an intense sort of curiosity, as 
though it were reaching out, en- 
veloping her. 

Sunlight spilling through the 
window, spread a warm languorous 
pool about her, and she felt pleas- 

108 



antly drowsy. She closed her eyes. 
After awhile, her head tilted, and 
the rushing world faded as though 
it had never been. 

She floated, placidly content. She 
seemed, suddenly, to possess a mil- 
lion eyes that probed about in all 
directions at once. Her body 
stretched, elongating itself, and 
moved forward through a trans- 
lucent fluid to an invisible wall, be- 
yond which stood shadowy figures. 
She focused her mind upon these 
figures, and they became clear. 

There was a little boy gazing at 
her in awe, his nose pressed against 
the glass in fascination, not certain 
if he should be frightened or not. 
Mentally, she smiled to herself and 
directed her thoughts to the boy, 
telling him not to be afraid. There 
were several children there, and 
Abby turned her attention to an- 
other. 

It was Linda! Linda staring with 
wide, curious eyes. And next to 
her a man. Dr. Gower. Her heart 
leaped — 

And she awoke with the warm 
sunlight streaming in upon her, her 
heart pounding unaccountably. 
She looked around. She was still in 
her front room before the windows. 
The television was going, present- 
ing the newscast that followed the 
zoo program. 

It was just a dream, but it had 
seemed so real that it still disturbed 
her minutes after she was fully 
awake. For awhile, she was not 
even certain that the dream had 
not been real and that this now 
was not really a dream, that reality 
and dreaming had not somehow 
suddenly changed places. 

Abby was still sitting at the win- 
CHARLES E. FRITCH 




dow when Linda came home from 
school. She watched as Linda and 
the boy came down the moving 
sidewalk and stepped off on the 
island before the house. They stood 
talking for a moment, then Linda 
rushed up the walk. The door 
whirred open and shut, and Linda 
instead of looking for Abby as was 
her habit, went straight to the esca- 
lator. 

Abby called, “Linda!” 

The girl paused. “I — I’ll be back 
down.” 

“I’d like to see you right now, 
please,” Abby’s tone, though not 
hostile, was unrefusable. 

Linda appeared hesitantly in the 
doorway, hands behind her. 

Abby smiled pleasantly. “Who 
was that boy, dear? I don’t think I 
know him.” 

“Jimmy Stone,” Linda said, ex- 
citement creeping into her voice. 
“He lives over in Sector Five, and 
he’s in my history class at school.” 
Abby recognized the symptoms 
and frowned mentally at the diag- 
nosis. “He’s probably a very nice 
young man, but — ” 

“He is, he’s very nice,” Linda 
agreed quickly. “He’s going to be 
an astronautical engineer. Look 
what he made me in plastics class.” 
She drew her hands from behind 
her and held a scarlet rose cupped 
in them. It looked soft, as smooth 
as though it had been just plucked, 
as though it held a fragrance that 
was not artificial. 

“It’s very nice,” Abby admitted, 
but she wondered how in this age 
of intense specialization a future 
astronautical engineer had man- 
aged to enroll in a plastics class to 
waste his time making pseudo- 
roses. Despite her wish to the con- 

ESCAPE MECHANISM 



trary, she found herself briefly ad- 
miring the youngster, then told 
herself it was a case of puppy love 
that had inspired the frivolity. 
“But don’t you think you’re a little 
young to be thinking about boys?” 

“No,” Linda said defensively, 
pouting. “I like Jimmy and he likes 
me. I don’t see why we shouldn’t 
see each other.” 

“You’re in the same class,” Abby 
pointed out ; “that should be 
enough. After all, you’re only sev- 
enteen.” 

“Yes,” Linda flared in annoy- 
ance, and rushed on in a sudden 
torrent, “then I’ll be eighteen and 
then nineteen and then twenty and 
then thirty. If I wait long enough 
maybe I’ll let life pass me by, 
like — ” She paused, eyes wide and 
regretful at what she was about to 
say. 

Abby smiled gently, but a cold 
chill gripped her. “Like me?” she 
said. “You’re afraid of being an 
old maid like me, is that it?” 

She hated to use the expression 
“old maid,” but she knew that was 
what many people called her. She 
minded the name more than she 
admitted even to herself, for the 
words held an unpleasantness, a 
loneliness she didn’t feel — very 
often anyway. But then she had 
Linda for company. 

Linda’s features softened. “I’m 
sorry, Aunt Abby,” she said quietly. 

“That’s all right, child, I under- 
stand how you feel,” Abby said. 
“Now, you go along up and take a 
shower and get yourself ready for 
supper, and maybe we’ll talk about 
it later.” 

Linda nodded soberly and turned 
away. 

Abby sat in the silence of the 

109 




room, listening to the soft whisper 
of the escalator. It hurt her to think 
that Linda wasn’t going to show 
her the plastic rose at first. You 
had to be firm in these matters, 
though, to prevent worse trouble. 
If care weren’t taken, Linda might 
rush off and be married before she 
was ready. This was a difficult time 
for the poor thing, that was cer- 
tain, but she’d get over it. The lit- 
tle things in a child’s life always 
seemed more important than they 
really were; that’s why there were 
older people to guide them. 

Her own mother had been very 
strict, and Abby saw no reason to 
regret it. If it hadn’t been for that, 
she might have married the first 
boy she’d met. She tried to recall 
him, but somehow she couldn’t, 
and only a vague image came to 
mind. It disturbed her to have that 
blank spot in her memory, but So- 
matic drugs had consistently failed 
to fill it in. 

Linda came in a few minutes 
later, freshly scrubbed but not con- 
vinced. 

U A11 ready, dear?” Abby said 
pleasantly. 

She got up and put a consoling 
arm about the young girl. Together 
they went into the dining room, 
where Gretchen had silently placed 
the appropriate food a few minutes 
before. 



T HEY ATE in silence, with only 
the sounds of eating and an 
occasional whir from the robot- 
maid as she appeared and disap- 
peared with dishes. Linda was 
moody, thoughtful. 

“How was the field trip, dear?” 
Abby wondered. 

110 



“All right,” Linda answered. 
“The Venusian amoeba is very 
much like our own, the man said. It 
even reproduces itself by division.” 

“Isn’t that nice,” Abby said, just 
a bit hesitantly, uncertain that re- 
production by any means should 
be discussed. However, if they 
taught it in school — 

“I feel sorry for it,” Linda said. 

Abby stared at her. 

“Having no one to love,” Linda 
went on, a faraway look on her 
face, “no one to love it. If it has 
any feelings, it must be very 
lonely.” 

Abby made an irritable stab at a 
piece of synthetic potato on her 
plate. “Nonsense,” she snapped. 
“You’re talking like a silly school- 
girl.” 

On second thought, she decided 
that Linda was a silly schoolgirl 
and would naturally talk like one; 
she was still a little girl, dependent 
for protection upon her Aunt Abby. 
That thought gave her some meas- 
ure of comfort. 

“I feel like an amoeba some- 
times,” Linda said, poking restlessly 
at a piece of meat on her plate. 

“Sometimes I wish you were, 
dear,” Abby said, feeling strangely 
annoyed by the statement. “Now, 
eat your steak before.it gets cold.” 

“Don’t you ever get lonely, Aunt 
Abby,” Linda asked. “Suppose Dr. 
Gower went away, wouldn’t you be 
lonely.” 

“Dr. Gower is not going away,” 
Abby pointed out. 

“He might,” Linda insisted. 
“You haven’t seen him for three 
days now. He might be gone 
already.” 

Despite herself, Abby felt sudden 
panic. “He’s probably busy. Doc- 

CHARLES E. FRITCH 




tors are busy these days.” 

“He could have called.” 

“Linda, eat your supper,” Abby 
said sternly, “and stop this non- 
sense. Besides, what difference 
would it make. One person doesn’t 
make the world begin or end. Dr. 
Gower and I are good friends, but 
we must adjust to these things. If 
he is gone away, he’s gone, and 
that’s all there is to it!” 

She tried to make her voice 
sound calm, but there was a sink- 
ing feeling in her stomach, and a 
small questioning voice in the back 
of her mind kept asking did he? 
did he? did he? Furiously, she 
thrust the thought aside. 

“I saw him at the zoo today,” 
Linda said. 

“You did?” Abby said, relieved, 
and then she thought of her dream 
of the zoo and of Linda standing 
there and Dr. Gower beside the 
girl. Could she be psychic? No, 
there was a simpler explanation. “I 
saw you both there,” she went on, 
smiling, “on television this after- 
noon.” 

Linda frowned. “But Dr. Gower 
didn’t arrive until the program 
was over, Aunt Abby.” 

“I saw you,” Abby insisted. 

“But I’m certain of it.” 

“You must be mistaken, dear,” 
Abby said in a tone of finality. And 
that settled that. 

The doorbuzzer sounded, and 
Gretchen whirred to answer it. 
Abby pressed a button beneath the 
table, and the image of Dr. Gower 
appeared on a small screen set in- 
visibly in the opposite wall. She 
could feel her blood accelerate at 
the sight of him, but she wondered 
why he looked disturbed. 

She rose. “I’m going in to see Dr.

Gower, dear,” she told Linda. 
“Now, don’t rush your food.” 
Linda nodded abstractedly. She 
wasn’t in a rushing mood. 

“Abby, how are you?” Dr. Gower 
said warmly, at her approach. 

“Very well, thank you, Tom,” 
Abby said. “I thought I might have 
to get sick to see you.” 

“I was busy,” he explained. 
“The colonization of space brings 
up a great many new medical prob- 
lems. How’s Linda?” 

“Fine. I’m afraid, she’s begin- 
ning to have a slight case of puppy 
love; I’m sure it can be discour- 
aged in time, though.” 

Dr. Gower hesitated. Then he 
said, “Linda’s a normal young girl, 
Abby. You can’t stifle her natural 
desires forever.” 

“I not only can, but I will.” To 
cushion the harshness of the state- 
ment, she added, “At least until 
she’s mature enough to decide these 
things for herself. She’s still a 
child.” 

“A great many women get mar- 
ried at eighteen,” Dr. Gower 
pointed out. “Physically, it’s a good 
age for marriage, and a psychology 
going against the physical grain 
isn’t going to help.” 

“There are such things in life, 
Dr. Gower,” Abby said a bit cold- 
ly, “as moral considerations. We’re 
not animals, you know.” 

“It might help sometimes,” Dr. 
Gower mused, “if there were a lit- 
tle more animal in us and a little 
less so-called human.” 

Abby found her enthusiasm for 
seeing Dr. Gower ebbing, being re- 
placed by what she considered a 
justified annoyance. Dr. Gower 
knew her feeling about Linda. 
Something seemed to have changed 

111 




his tactics. She did not like the 
change. 

“If you don’t mind,” she said, 
“I’d like to bring up Linda in my 
own way. The courts made me legal 
guardian of Linda until she’s 
twenty-one, and I intend to protect 
her until then to the best of my 
ability.” 

“By that time, you’ll have her so 
confused about the world she’ll be 
defenseless against it. I never said 
anything before, Abby — ” 

“And now is a poor time to 
start!” Abby’s voice was like ice. 
“I’m sorry, Dr. Gower, but if you 
persist in talking this way, I’ll have 
to ask you to leave. Linda is in my 
charge, and I won’t stand for inter- 
ference, even from you.” 

The doctor’s shoulders slumped 
dejectedly. “Do you know why you 
were chosen guardian, Abby,” he 
said slowly. 

“Of course. I was the nearest 
relative. Why bring that up?” 

Dr. Gower shook his head. 
“Nothing,” he said, after awhile. 
“Nothing at all. I came around to 
say goodbye, Abby.” 

Abby wavered, the ice in her 
melting. “Goodbye?” 

“I’m leaving for Venus,” he said, 
“the day after tomorrow. They 
need doctors up there, and I can 
probably do more good there than 
here. Besides, I’d like to investi- 
gate these amoeba creatures; I sus- 
pect they have more intelligence 
than we give them credit for.” 

“I — I’ll be sorry to see you leave, 
Tom.” 

“I came to ask you to go with 
me. You know how I feel about 
you, Abby; I thought I’d try just 
once more.” 

“I couldn’t leave Linda,” Abby 
112 



said. 

“The standard excuse,” he re- 
minded her, his voice more weary 
than bitter. “What Linda has 
needed all these years was a father, 
Abby. You’re giving her a warped 
viewpoint.” 

“The Somaticists don’t think so,” 
Abby flung at him. 

He crimsoned. “Somatics aren’t 
the answer. Our era has become so 
mechanical that people have come 
to think that pressing a button is 
going to cure the evils of the world. 
Pills and pushbuttons are fine in 
their place, Abby, but they’re not 
the answer, not the complete one 
anyway. At one time, they thought 
psychiatry was the answer ; they 
were wrong there, too. The an- 
swer’s probably a combination of 
the two.” 

“I’m not looking for the answer 
to anything,” Abby said wearily. 
“I just want to be let alone.” 

Dr. Gower nodded and turned to 
g°- 

“Have a nice trip,” Abby said, 
trying to sound cheerful, “I’m sorry 
we had to argue like this.” The 
thought of his leaving brought a 
sinking sensation which she tried to 
thrust off and couldn’t. But there 
was Linda to think of; the girl 
couldn’t go to Venus. 

At the door, Dr. Gower hesitated. 
“I don’t know if I should tell you 
this; it might help, and it might 
not.” He paused again uncertainly 
and then went on in a decisive tone. 
“Linda’s your own child, Abby.” 

She looked at him, puzzled. “Of 
course. The courts — ” 

Dr. Gower shook his head im- 
patiently. “I don’t mean that. I 
mean Linda was actually bom to 
you.” 



CHARLES E. FRITCH 




The words sank in, but Abby 
found them meaningless. Two and 
two did not make five no matter 
how many times you added them. 
There was a tense silence, but she 
didn’t know what to say to fill it. 

“That’s what happened in your 
blank spot, Abby,” Dr. Gower went 
on. “You ran away from home when 
you were twenty-one, because your 
mother was too strict, because she 
acted just like you’re acting with 
Linda. Before she could find you 
again, someone else had. You were 
pregnant.” 

Abby’s brow furrowed. “You 
mean — ” the thought completed 
itself, and a look of horror replaced 
the frown. “That’s a horrible thing 
to say, even in a lie.” 

“I wish I were lying,” Dr. Gower 
said earnestly. “You didn’t remem- 
ber anything that had happened, 
and were still dazed for nearly a 
year afterward. Your subconscious 
used amnesia as an escape mecha- 
nism, and you forgot the incident, 
repressed it without realizing it. An 
escape is sometimes possible only in 
the mind, where Somaticists are 
often helpless. I didn’t say anything 
before, but now I’m afraid Linda 
may be made to suffer if I don’t.” 
Abby stared at him in shocked 
silence. She said, after awhile. “It’s 
not true, it can’t be.” 

Dr. Gower shrugged. “I’m sorry, 
Abby, it is. It’s not Linda you’re 
worried about, it’s yourself; you’re 
afraid to face reality.” 

“Get out,” Abby said slowly, hat- 
ing him for that. Her voice rose the 
least bit. “I won’t listen to these 
lies.” 

“I thought it might help. Say 
goodbye to Linda for me.” The door 
closed behind him with a click. 



Abby stared at the closed door, 
a small portion of her was calm, the 
rest chaotic. The calm portion 
wondered why she should be so 
disturbed by something so obviously 
impossible. All these years she’d 
been wrong about Dr. Gower, trust- 
ing him as a friend. For what he 
said was untrue, of course. It had to 
be. And yet why couldn’t she re- 
member things? It was only eight- 
een years ago and important things 
had happened in that year, but 
somehow her memory bypassed 
their happening. It was like read- 
ing a book with several pages blank ; 
you knew from later pages what 
had happened, but the actual ex- 
perience of the events was lost. 
Could it be — the thought came de- 
spite her — could it be that she’d 
had amnesia, that Dr. Gower had 
really told her the truth, that some- 
one had actually — 

“No. He was lying,” she told the 
room. 

“He never lied before,” Linda 
said quietly from the doorway. 
“You— heard?” 

Linda nodded. 

Abby tried to smile. “I’m afraid, 
dear, that Dr. Gower is like all men. 
When he couldn’t have what he 
wanted — ” her face clouded at the 
thought — “he tried to shock me, to 
hurt me, to make me ashamed . .” 
“Would it make you ashamed to 
have me for a daughter?” 

Abby’s heart beat quickly. “Of 
course not, Linda. But the circum- 
stances — ” 

“I see,” Linda said slowly. “They 
have a name for children like me; 
that’s what you’re ashamed of. Or 
maybe, as Dr. Gower said, you’re 
afraid for yourself!” 

“But it’s not true, Linda, don’t

113 




you see?” Abby insisted. 

She put her arm on the girl’s 
shoulder. Linda shook it off; tears 
welling in her eyes. 

“You don’t even want to know,” 
the girl accused. “You don’t even 
care.” And she turned and ran from 
the room. 

The escalator whispered, and 
Abby stood in the center of the 
room looking at the empty doorway. 
She stood on the brink of a great 
precipice, balancing precariously, 
and for a brief moment she found 
herself believing what Dr. Gower 
had said. He was a fine man, and 
good, and he would not lie to her. 
Things her brother had said came 
to mind, once-harmless statements 
that seemed to take on new signif- 
icance, as though he’d said them to 
prepare her for this moment. And 
suddenly, very suddenly, the world 
was tottering; dazedly, she made 
her way to a chair and sat limply 
in it. 

Dr. Gower was gone now, and she 
would never see him again. She 
knew that, and she knew that de- 
spite the things she’d said, that it 
did matter that he was going. But 
then she had Linda to think of. Or 
was it really Linda that concerned 
her? She could take the girl along, 
certainly; that would even clear up 
the problem of Jimmy Stone. Was 
it really the marriage she feared, a 
fear based upon some secret mental 
block in her mind? The doubt re- 
turned then, and she wasn’t sure. 
She wasn’t sure of anything any- 
more. Abby had to think. She had 
to quiet her nerves and the frantic 
jumbled thoughts that had begun 
to race through her mind. 

She felt dizzy and held a hand to 
one of the walls to steady herself 



as she walked to her bedroom. 
From the dressing table drawer she 
took a bottle of dreaftipills. The 
label was fuzzy to her eyes, but the 
word Danger stood out in bold 
letters. Abby swallowed three of the 
pills, which was two more than the 
safe dosage, and lay across the bed, 
eyes closed. The door to the room 
closed automatically. 

“It’s not true,” she told herself 
again, a desperate urgency to her 
voice. “I’ve got to get away from 
these thoughts. Got to get away. 
Got — to — escape.” 

She felt drowsy, but the thought 
of what Dr. Gower had said per- 
sisted. It couldn’t be true. It 
couldn’t. And yet it might be; it 
was the possibility that disturbed 
her. That blank spot. Eighteen 
years ago. Eighteen years . 

HE DRIFTED into a restless 
sleep. Mentally, she traveled 
across the familiar plains of her 
past to that strange dark canyon 
she couldn’t recall. Her mind ho- 
vered frightened above the depths, 
failing to see through its darkness; 
then she passed to the other side, to 
her childhood, to when she was a 
young girl and her mother was 
alive. 

The scene burst upon her with 
vivid clarity, and she found herself 
reliving it. It was there, all of it. 
The home life, protecting and yet 
restraining. Her dissatisfaction. The 
secret determination. The running 
away in the dead of night. It was 
all there, just as Dr. Gower had 
said. 

“But it’s a dream,” she mur- 
mured, “just a dream.” 

Yet it seemed a reality. She could 

CHARLES E. FRITCH 



114 




feel the cool night press upon her as 
she made her way slowly through 
the strange-familiar darkness and 
descended into the depths of the 
canyon. The feeling of having been 
here before was with her, and it 
brought terror with it. She walked 
on, looking to either side, listening 
fearfully. And then she stopped, 
her blood becoming ice. 

There was a man before her. She 
could see only his eyes, but they 
were cruel eyes, savage and lustful. 

Knowledge came then, bursting 
over her in a raging tide. She 
screamed and ran, her footsteps 
echoing frantically as she hurried 
through the darkness, looking for 
an opening for a protecting light. 
But no opening appeared, no light 
came. She ran until she was ex- 
hausted, and then she sank to the 
ground panting trying to still her 
spasms of breath. There was a 
small sound, as of the scraping of a 
shoe and she looked into the eyes 
again. 

She screamed again and again 
and again not knowing where 
screams ended and echoes began. 
She put her hands over her ears and 
screamed into the darkness. She 
could feel hands reaching out for 
her and she shrank away from 
them. 

Her mind was a playground for 
terror. She had to escape. She had 
to. 

(But sometimes the only escape 
is in the mind!) 

The hands reached out. She was 
suddenly falling, down, down, 
down. Calmness came, and a grate- 
ful thought appeared : she had 

escaped. Nothing else mattered; 
only that . 

She stopped falling. The mist 
ESCAPE MECHANISM 



grew thick, thicker ; it became 
dense; it became liquid. She could 
not feel the beating of her heart, 
but her mind was calm and it 
looked about with a detachment 
that was intellectual. 

She was floating again, floating 
silently through a world of murky 
fluid. The liquid was pressing with 
a force so gentle it almost did not 
exist. It enveloped her like a pro- 
tecting shield. 

She drifted. There seemed to be 
no direction but outward. Her 
thoughts went out and they re- 
turned with impressions. This was 
her world and she was the center 
of it. There were no problems here, 
no encroachments on existence or 
security. It was like a return to the 
womb. Womb? she thought. She 
turned the word over in her mind 
and found the concept alien. She 
regarded it intellectually, at leisure. 

Time passed silently, without in- 
cident, without measurement. It 
had no meaning, no referent. 

Curious after awhile, she went 
forward, her mind impinging upon 
shadowy figures behind the trans- 
parent barrier. She focussed her 
attention upon them, and the image 
cleared. 

There was a man there, and a 
woman, and a girl. She could hear 
them as they spoke. 

“I don’t know why you wanted 
to come here, Abby,” the man was 
saying. “You’ll see enough of these 
creatures on Venus.” 

“This one is special,” the woman 
said slowly, tasting the words like 
some unfamiliar food. “It’s what 
made me change my mind about 
— things. It must be very lonely.” 

“Bosh,” the man scoffed gently. 
“Intelligent or not, an amoeba 



115 




doesn’t have feelings of loneliness.” 

“Doesn’t it?” the woman won- 
dered. “Perhaps not at first. But 
being able to probe the minds of 
humans and sympathize with them 
yet not contact them can . 

“We’ll be late for the rocket, 
Mother,” the girl said. “Jimmy 
promised he’d be down to see me 
off and let me know if he can go 
to the Venus Academy next year.” 

“All right, Linda, we’re going 
now.” 

At the door, the woman turned 
for a last look; her thoughts were 
thoughts of sorrow, of pity, of — 
regret, perhaps. 

“You’ll learn much of the world 
this way,” the thoughts came, “and 
you’ll have time to readjust. 
Knowledge will pyramid gently, 
and with it will come wisdom. 
After awhile, escape won’t be nec- 
essary. You’ll want to return then 
and be a part of your world. Mean- 
while, I must help my own people; 
this is the best way for both of us 
to escape.” 



The woman linked arms with the 
man and the girl then, and the 
three of them went out. 

Silence returned, bringing with 
it a troubled wonderment. Then 
the murky fluid flowed past all vis- 
ion, and the world returned, safe 
and familiar. The thoughts re- 
turned briefly, as echoes, but they 
were unfamiliar this time and 
meaningless. 

But it was not always so, and it 
would not always be, for contem- 
plation bred curiosity, and curi- 
osity bred knowledge, and knowl- 
edge bred desire, and desire the 
ways and means of accomplish- 
ment. 

Meanwhile, there was quiet, still- 
ness, a peace she had never known. 
The fluid flowed about her in a 
silence that held no sound, no 
movement. It was womb-like, pro- 
tective. 

It seemed natural that she should 
be here. 

For the moment, she was con- 
tent. • • •

Prescriptions for A and H- bomb 
radiation sickness may consist of 
shots of ground glass, or pulverized 
limestone or quartz. Tests have 
shown that such injections saved 
one-fifth of the animals that would 
have otherwise died from moder- 
ately high doses of radiation all 
over their bodies. Since the life-sav- 
ing effect seems due to inflamma- 
tion from introduction of foreign 
material, the findings may lead to 
the discovery of other substances 
which can be used with even better 
results. 

Farmers of the future may not mind 
the rocks in the pastures and fields 
too much — provided the rocks are 
granite. Recent tests have shown 
that very finely pulverized granite, 
when spread on the fields, is an ex- 
cellent fertilizer which provides 
potassium to alfalfa and clover. 
Two of the granite minerals, feld- 
spar and mica, supply the potas- 
sium which is one of the three fer- 
tilizer elements that is necessary to 
a great variety of plants. 

The shortage of lumber which has 
been predicted may be alleviated 
to a large extent in future times by 
a lumber making robot. British 
scientists have devised an automatic 
machine which uses sawmill waste 



to turn out strong, continuous, 
warpless board. Small chips of ma- 
terials such as fibrous woods, sugar 
cane waste and even flax sheaves 
are pushed from a storage hopper 
into a drier. A film of liquid resin 
is then applied to the chips to fos- 
ter adhesion; and then the carpet 
of chips is dropped on the press. A 
radio frequency heater starts the 
second drying process before the 
board is pressed to final thickness. 
It emerges from the machine as 
continuous board at the rate of 
about twenty feet per minute and 
is about four feet wide and three- 
quarters of an inch thick. Only 
three trained men are required to 
watch over the completely auto- 
matic process, which is designed to 
serve on a twenty-four hour a day 
basis. 

Airplanes that break the sound bar- 
rier may someday be made of no 
more than laminated glass and plas- 
tics. Researchers have come up with 
a new material which consists of 
glass cloth and three different plas- 
tic resins laminated and bonded to- 
gether. The finished product can 
withstand temperatures of five hun- 
dred degrees Fahrenheit for eight 
days or more, and can withstand 
these high temperatures better than 
either aluminum or magnesium. 

Giant windmills may dot future 
landscapes as an aid to weather 
control and smog control. The 150 
foot blade on these motor driven 
fans, swirling 150 feet above the 
ground, would create artificial ther- 
mal updrafts. The device would 
draw air from a radius of about five 
miles at a rate of 65 to 95 miles 
per hour. The result would be a 



117 




funnel of fast moving air similar to 
that found in tornadoes. Changing 
the angle at which the blades oper- 
ate, or varying the power of the 500 
horse-power motor, would regulate 
the thermal and create the desired 
stream of warm air at the place 
and time it was necessary. 

Traffic lights on the highways of 
tomorrow may be blue and yellow 
instead of red and green. Color ex- 
perts havie found that red-green 
blindness is the most prevalent of 
all color blindness, and that about 
2500 traffic deaths a year are caused 
by this inability to observe the sig- 
nals properly. The blue-yellow com- 
bination would, according to these 
researchers, be the logical answer, 
since these two colors are lowest on 
the scale of color blindness. They 
predict that though the change-over 
would be difficult, traffic accidents 
due to this disability would be cut 
by one-third to one-half. 

Time travel is a favorite science 
fiction gimmick, and now medical 
research has come up with a close 
approximation. A new drug extract 
taken from a fungus which attacks 
grain has been tested in Britain, 
which makes adults feel as though 
they had shrunk to the size of a 
child. It also snatches them back 
through time to relive childhood 
events with extraordinary clarity. 
The often long and tedious process 



necessary to trace back the causes of 
mental derangement and adult neu- 
rosis is speeded up immeasurably 
by this “time travel” drug, and psy- 
chiatrists are hailing its discovery as 
a great step forward in the treat- 
ment of the mentally ill. 

Radar and radio waves may some- 
day prove that the Earth wears an 
invisible girdle of electricity similar 
to the visible rings which encircle 
Saturn. Geophysical research points 
to the fact that some extra-terres- 
trial force that exerts its influence 
on the Earth’s restless magnetic 
field does exist. The band which is 
thought to circle the Earth’s equa- 
torial area 12,000 to 16,000 miles 
in space may have been built up 
over the ages by electrical storms 
and may be the force that keeps the 
terrestrial magnetic field from re- 
turning to normal for several days 
after a magnetic storm. 

First aid kits in homes of the fu- 
ture may one day include a pocket 
sized resuscitator and anaesthetic 
machine. The new gadget weighs 
less than two pounds, including a 
thumb-sized gas or oxygen cylinder. 
It has a rubber face mask, a re- 
breathing bag and, without the 
cylinders attached, can be held in 
the palm of one hand. Patients with 
heart trouble could keep one handy 
at home or in the office ; passengers 
in planes flying at high altitudes

could use them in emergencies; 
and police and firemen could use 
them for unexpected births, drown- 
ing accidents, mine explosions and 
fires. In short, this handy new ma- 
chine could be available at all times 
for any emergency suffocation 
which might arise. 

A floating heliport which rests 
on water may be the answer to 
quick convenient air service from 
your home town. A test model has 
been built on a six story office 
building in Phoenix, Arizona, and 
consists of an aluminum platform 
floating in two inches of water. The 
building has not been reinforced at 
all, yet the roof shows no signs of 
caving in. The 1 1 -by- 16-foot float 
distributes the landing shock of the 
helicopter to the entire roof area 
covered by diked-in water and so 
eliminates the pinpoint stresses that 
have in the past required extensive 
changes in the very frame of build- 
ings receiving concrete heliports on 
their roofs. The new installation 
weighs about 50,000 pounds and 
would cost about $5.00 per square 
foot, and could be installed without 
reconstruction on any roof already 
stressed for about 40 pounds per 
square foot. A concrete landing 
strip, such as is now used weighs 
about 50 tons and costs $22.00 per 
square foot. 

"Fish farming" may someday be 
an important adjunct to grain and 
vegetable farming. Recent work 
with farmland ponds, which have 
been fertilized with manure and 
compost and artificial fertilizers, 
promoting lush vegetable growth in 
the water, show that vegetation-eat- 
ing fish thrive. The carnivorous fish 



feed on these, and the farmer reaps 
a fish harvest that often produces 
more income than that from an 
acre of land. Salt water fish farms, 
which use electric currents to trap 
the “crop 5 ’ on a mass scale, are the 
next step in producing enough food 
to go around. 

Buildings comparable in size to 
two city blocks for use as hangars, 
storage warehouses and small fac- 
tories may soon be made entirely by 
prefabricated methods. A new de- 
sign, featuring a double cantilever 
and a space-frame construction 
principle, can be mass produced for 
permanent or temporary structures. 
The units can be folded like an ac- 
cordion and shipped to the con- 
struction site where unskilled labor 
can lock them into position. Since 
there are no key structural points

in the weblike design, bombing it 
would be like poking a hole in a 
spider web. Parts damaged by ex- 
plosion could be replaced quickly 
without disabling the building while 
repairs are being made. 

Your TV set, ten years from now, 
may have a picture screen so thin 
that it can be hung on the wall like 
a painting. According to predic- 
tions by General Electric scientists, 
the circuits and wiring would be 
built into the frame and the tubes 
would be a grid of wiring. Controls 



would be located in a small box be- 
side your easy chair, and the model 
would receive color as well as 
monochrome pictures. Work is now 
going on to speed the plotting of 
aircraft in military filter centers by 
means of a picture-on-the-wall plot- 
ting board which uses electronic 
computer circuitry techniques to 
convert signals into an image on the 
board. This technique, when fully 
developed, can be carried over to 
civilian uses and will make possible 
the predicted TV installation. 



A CHAT WITH THE EDITOR (Continued from page 3) 



miles he leaned over several times 
to look out the window, his face 
close to mine. He would point at 
cars and I nodded and told him 
what makes they were. We passed 
a small airport and he got quite ex- 
cited and pressed his face against 
the window. I explained that they 
were airplanes and he made mo- 
tions with his hands that indicated 
he understood that planes went up 
and down. When he moved back to 
his seat there was a big wet spot on 
the window where his mouth had 
been. 

About twenty miles from New 
York the old lady took him by the 
hand and they got off. As the bus 
moved on, I watched them as they 
stood by the side of the road. She 



was wiping his face with a hand- 
kerchief and he was standing child- 
like there for her, his knees slightly 
bent, his arms hanging loosely and 
his face turned up at an odd angle. 

I thought about them until the 
bus pulled into the terminal on 
Forty-third Street. I couldn’t forget 
the old lady and her problem dur- 
ing years past and years to come. 

Even that dim, dirty, noisy street 
outside the terminal looked bright- 
er now, for some reason, and the 
air was pretty good and the stretch 
of sky above the tall buildings was 
a bright blue. Suddenly I recalled 
the reason for my trip, but it was 
no longer very important; it was 
now almost inconsequential. 

See what I mean? — jlq 



Science is not the disembodied sort of activity that some people would 
make out, engaged in the abstract task of pursuing universal truth, but a 
social function intimately linked up with human history and human des- 
tiny.
