TONY 



BOUCHER 



Tn the mid-tliirties a young man 
named William AntKony Par- 
ker White resolved to begin a 
writing career. A canny friend 
advised him that “William” was 
not the most memorable of first 
names, nor “White” the most 
memorable of last — in fact, the 
Library of Congress listed no 
fewer than 75 writers named Wil- 
liam White in some variation or 
another. So William A. P. White 
adopted a pen name. In fact, he 
adopted two. As H. H. Holmes he 
wrote mysteries — including that 
fascinating detective story in 
which the most enjoyable part of 
the detection is figuring out what 
real science-fiction writers and 
fans are Hidden behind the made- 
up names. Rocket to the Morgue 
— and more recently brightened 
the pages of the New York Times 
book review on Sundays with his 
column of mystery criticism. As 
Anthony Boucher he ornamented 
our field since 1941, when Snul- 
bug appeared in the old Un- 
known. 

White, Holmes, Boucher — 
whatever you called him, Tohy 
was a man of many talents. With 



J. Francis McComas, He founded 
The Magazine of Fantasy in 1950 
and piloted it to many honors. 
As a writer, he graced one of the 
first issues of this magazine with 
his Transfer Point. As an enter- 
tainer, he conducted a regular ra- 
dio program on the Pacifica net- 
work and delighted many a sci- 
ence-fiction audience with his 
witty and informed talks as toast- 
master and master of ceremonies, 
most recently at the Science Fic- 
tion Writers of America awards 
banquet in California, on March 
16th of this year. 

^^hat was Tony’s last public ap- 
-*■ pearance. Six weeks later, on 
April 30th, he died, at the age of 
56. 

Tony Boucher graced our field. 
He had many friends, in all his 
areas of activity — perhaps he 
was the only man in the world 
who had to register at hotels un- 
der all three of his names, so all 
his friends could find him. None 
of them will miss him more than 
we do.

all purpose. They lived for art — dead art. 
They were stragglers in a city that had lost 



of these days you’re go- 
ing to pierce your ear- 
drum doing that,” Pamela Rozet 
said from the doorway. 

“Uhhh?” 

"That paint brush. If you 
don’t stop scratching the inside 
of your ear with it, you’re going 
to hurt yourself. Didn’t your 



mother ever tell you not to stick 
anything smaller than your el- 
bow in your ear?” 

Arthur Halleck took the end of 
the paint brush in question out 
of his right ear and scowled dimly 
at it. He said, completely mala- 
propos, “What in the name of 
the living Zoroaster ever hap- 
pened to. brushes? It was bad 
enough when they were making 





them out of nylon. What’s this 
stuff? Anything to cheapen the 
product The old masters used to 
paint with bristle brushes, or red 
sable hair. Have you ever been in 
a museum and looked real close- 
ly at an original Rembrandt, or 
even a Leonardo?” 

“Yes,” Pam said. 

“Did you ever see any hair 
from their paint brushes?” 

“I didn’t look that close,” she 
said. 

“Well, you didn’t. But take a 
look at some of Picasso’s stuff, 
not to speak of mine. Hair, or 
other brush fiber, all through the 
paint.” He tossed the offending 
brush to a colorfully bespattered 
table. “I’ve been all over town. 
Into every art shop that survived 
in any shape at all. There’s not 
a bristle brush to be found.” 
“Possibly you can get some on 
the mainland, when you take this 
painting over.” 

“No,” he growled disgustedly. 
“They don’t make them any 
more. You can’t ultra-mate the 
manufacture of decent bristle 
brushes. And anything you can’t 
ultra-mate in the Ultra-welfare 
State goes down the drain.” 

He stepped back and stared 
gloomily at the painting on the 
easel. 

“Is it finished?” she asked. 
“Doesn’t it look finished?” Ke 
demanded in irritation. 

Pam came closer and looked 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



and said patiently, “Long since 
I told you. Art, that I’ve never 
got beyond the Impressionalists.” 
“Well, damnit, the Representa- 
tional-Abstract School is the 
nearest thing to the Impression- 
alists for decades. Can’t you see, 
confound it?” 

“No.” 

“Well, look. It gives the same 
effect as the quick impression 
Van Gogh, Renoir, Degas and the 
rest demanded. You get a quick 
flash, and your immediate impres- 
sion is that it’s completely ab- 
stract, but then you realize that 
it’s the ruin of the entrance to a 
subway station.” 

“I guess you do, at that,” she 
said doubtfully. 

T Te stared at the four-foot- 
-*■ square painting. “No won- 
der it’s no good,” he said. “Work- 
ing with this quick-drying me- 
tallic-acrylic paint on this ridicu- 
lous presdwood-duplicator board 
would have one of those Cro- 
Magnon cave painters climbing 
the wall.” 

“Aren’t you going to Have it 
duplicated and registered?” 

“Of course. Sooner or later. 
I’m going to hit, Pam. Then it’s 
you and me.” 

SHe looked at him, a shade of 
wistfulness in Her overly tired 
face. She was a girl of averages, 
pleasantly so. Average hdght and 
weight and of an average pretti- 

7 




ness, given Her approximately 
thirty-years of age. But there was 
a vulnerable something about her 
mouth that added. She was, and 
always had been, attractive to 
men who carried the dream, who 
were creative, ambitious. 

“I thought it was already you 
and me, Art. That it had been for 
the past two years and more.” 
He said, a bit impatiently, 
“You know what I mean, Pam.” 
She went over to the window, 
avoiding the broken pane where 
it was patched with some old 
clothing, and rested her bottom 
on the ledge. She said, “Art, if 
we went back to the mainland 
and combined the income from 
our Inalienable Basic and added 
to that my royalties and your oc- 
casional sales, we’d be able to 
maintain a reasonably high stan- 
dard of living. We’d also be in a 
position to make contacts, meet 
our own kind, associate with' ...” 
“Associate with other charity 
cases,” He broke in bitterly. “I’ve 
told you, Pam, I’ll never become 
one more dependent on the Ultra- 
welfare State. 1’U pay my own 
way in the world, or I’ll go 
under. A man’s to be a man.” 
“You’re not exactly paying your 
way right this minute, Arthur 
Halleck. We’re scavengers, to use 
the politest term that comes to 
my tongue.” Her tone was testy. 

He shook his head. “Don’t 
roach me, Pam .We don’t take 
8 



anything that belongs to any- 
body. If we didn’t find it and 
use it, it’d slowly rot or rust 
away.” 

She said, slightly irritated Her- 
self now, “Look here, darling, 
you’re not taking anything that 
belongs to anyone else either 
when you accept the dividends 
that accrue to your ten shares of 
Inalienable Basic.” 

“Those dividends don’t grow 
on trees. Somebody does the 
work that produces them,” he 
said stubbornly. 

S he was really impatient now. 

“Look, Art, the super-abun- 
dance being produced under Peo- 
ple’s Capitalism now is not the 
product of the comparative hand- 
ful of workers and technicions 
who are required in industry and 
agriculture today. It’s the product 
of the accumulated work of all 
mankind down through the ages. 
A million years ago, some an- 
cestor of yours and mine first 
used fire. The whole race has 
been doing it since. Five thou- 
sand years ago, some slick over 
in the Near East first dreamed up 
the wheel. We’ve been using it 
ever since. Every generation 
comes up with something brand 
new to add to the accumulated 
pile of knowledge, know-how, art, 
science. This accumulated human 
know-how doesn’t belong to any- 
body or to any group, it belongs 

GALAXY 




to US all. At long last, as a re- 
sult of it the human race has 
licked the problem of producing 
plenty for everyone. No one need 
go hungry any more, nor cold, 
nor unsheltered, nor uneducated, 
nor without proper medical care. 
This is the legacy our ancestors 
have left us. It belongs to 
all of us; as a matter of fact 
the ten shares of Inalienable Bas- 
ic each citizen receives is a pre- 
cious small slice of pie, if you 
ask me. Just enough to keep us 
lesser breeds from revolt.” 

“I still say it’s charity,” Art 
Halleck said stubbornly. 

She brushed it off. “So what 
can you do about it? We didn’t 
make this world and we’re in no 
position to change its rules. Par- 
ticularly over here. If we were 
on the mainland we might join 
the Futurists, or something.” 

He turned back to the paint- 
ing on his easel and stared at it 
some more, saying over his 
shoulder, “I don’t have to change 
the rules. Sooner or later, my 
work will hit, and I’ll make my 
own way. You can still make 
your own way under People’s 
Capitalism, if you’ve got it on the 
ball. Those at the very top don’t 
depend on Ultra-welfare State-is- 
sued Inalienable Basic.” 

“They sure don’t,” she said 
sourly. “They usually Have in 
herited enough Variable Basic 
or private stock to keep them 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



like gods all their lives. And as 
far as hitting sooner or later, it’s 
obviously not sooner. How many 
of the last paintings sold?” 

He looked at her. “Seven.” 
“Seventy dollars worth, eh? 
Just barely enough to duplicate 
and register this one. By the time 
you’ve paid your transport back 
and forth to Greater Washington 
and p>ossibly bought a couple of 
paint brushes or so, nothing left 
at all.” 

“One of these days I’ll hit,” 
he said stubbornly. 

She gave up and turned and 
stared out the window in the di- 
rection of Washington Square. 

II 

S he said finally, “Art, was it 
beautiful?” 

He was busy cleaning his 
brushes now, grumbling about the 
speed with which' his metallic- 
acrylic medium dried. 

“Was what beautiful?” 
“Mahattan — before.” 

“Oh. Well, no.” 

“You were bom here, weren’t 
you?” 

“Up in the Bronx.” 

“Before the riots?” 

“Ummm. I was just a kid, 
but come to think of it, I was 
already sketching, drawing.” He 
snorted deprecation. “How many 
artists bother to learn to draw 
any more? It’s like a writer nev- 

9 




er bothering to leam tKe alpKa- 
bet.” 

“Why wasn’t it beautiful?” 

He gave up his unhappy view- 
ing of his work and his brushes 
and came to stand next to her, an 
arm gofing unconsciously around 
her waist. He followed her line of 
vision down along McDougal 
Street to the square where once 
scores of artist hopefuls had held 
their open-air shows. 

He said thoughtfully, scowling, 
“It’s an elastic word, beauty. 
Means different things to differ- 
ent people. You can find beauty 
in just about anything — garbage 
dumps, battlefields, desert, just 
about anything. But largely, big 
cities don’t lend themselves to 
beauty. Manhattan was probably 
a lovely setting back when the 
Indians were here, or even when 
the first small Dutch settlement 
was huddled down at this end of 
the island. But the way it was by 
the middle of the 20tili century? 
No. I’ve never been out of North 
America to supposedly beautiful 
cities like Paris, Rome or Rio, 
but I have seen San Francisco. It 
had a certain amotmt of beauty — 
before the riots, of course.” 

“I understand they weren’t so 
bad there.” 

“Bad enough. However, they’ve 
cleaned out some of the ruins and 
resettled a pseudo-city there. It’s 
hard to beat that Golden Gate 
setting.” 

10 



They were silent for a moment, 
then she said, “How could it ever 
have happened. Art?” 

T T e shrugged, and his words 
^ came slowly as he thought 
it out. ”It could easily enough 
have been foreseen. A city like 
this had stopped making sense, 
Pam. The original reasons for 
cities — towns like Jericho began 
to be eight thousand years ago 
— had disappeared. Walled vil- 
lages of farmers that could be 
defended against the nomads, 
trade centers built at crossroads, 
manufacturing centers, commer- 
cial centers. Putting walls around 
cities for defense stopped making 
sense. Modem transportation 
methods antiquated them as trade 
centers and manufacturing bases, 
as industry was able to decen- 
tralize. Today with communica- 
tions what they are, even com- 
mercial centers are anachronisms. 
You can handle business from 
anywhere to anywhere.” 

“But what happened?" 

“A lot of pressures. With the 
coming of automation and then 
ultra-mation, not only in manu- 
facture but in agriculture, the 
vmder-educated farm laborers, 
the unemployables, the unplace- 
ables flooded to the cities look- 
ing for jobs or, in their absence 
for relirf, for free handouts. As 
their numbers grew, and with’ 
them ghettos and slums, the bet- 

GALAXY 




ter-to-do city dwellers streamed 
out to suburbs. That meant a 
drop in tax income, and the city 
was faced witlj inadequate fimds 
for slum clearance, education, 
police and firemen. Even things 
like garbage collection were inad- 
equately financed. Which meant 
that still more of the better paid 
citizens left. Industry began to 
leave too, to get closer to sources 
of raw materials, and to areas 
where labor was cheaper. So taxes 
took another nose dive. 

“Television played a major 
part. These slum dwellers could 
watch the typical TV program 
which almost invariably portray- 
ed the actors, and certainly the 
advertising actors, as living lives 
of plenty. Their apartments or 
homes were always beautiful and 
totally equipped, their clothes the 
latest of fashion, their food boun- 
tiful and of the best, their chil- 
dren healthy and handsome, the 
schools they attended ideal. 
Needless to say, the slum dwell- 
ers, wanted these things. So some 
of the more aggressive made a 
few demonstrations — and were 
landed upon, to their further em- 
bitterment. Alarmed, more of the 
better elements left town for the 
suburbs, for New England, up- 
state New York, Jersey, Pennsyl- 
vania. Some of the more prosper- 
ous actually commuted to Flor- 
ida, fljring back and forth. More 
industry left town then, because 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



of higher taxes and the higher in- 
surance rates caused by the riots. 
So the city fathers brought in less 
income than ever, and there was 
less to spend on slum clearance, 
education, relief. So the riots 
grew in magnitude.” 

A rt Halleck shrugged in dis- 
taste at the memory. “So it 
went, and finally we had the big 
one. And never really recovered 
from that. Oh, things continued 
for a while. But by this time, 
nobody who could possibly 
afford it was left living in 
places like Manhattan, De- 
troit, Chicago and so on. Nor 
any business that could possibly 
get out. So came another riot, 
and another . and finally every- 
body left, including the police 
and firemen. That was the end.” 
“What happened to the slum 
element, the poverty stricken, the 
unadaptable?” 

He looked down at her. “As a 
writer. I’d think you’d know at 
least as well as I.” 

“I wondered how you’d put it, 
in view of your feelings on the 
government issuing Inalienable 
Basic.” 

He said, slowly again, scowling 
and as if grudgingly, “I suppose 
it was in the cards. No alternative. 
At approximately the same time 
the cities were a confusion of 
riots and discontent, they issued 
Inalienable Basic to eacK citizen, 

11 




ttius guaranteeing womb to tomb 
security. Overnight, not even the 
poverty stricken wanted to remain 
in the big cities. It was cheaper 
to live elsewhere, not to speak of 
being n^ore comfortable. So they 
streamed out Tike lemmings — or 
maybe rats. All except the hand- 
ful of baboons, of course.” 

Pam shook her head, and turn- 
ed away from the view of the 
street. “I sometimes wonder why 
they never came back.” 

“Who?” 

“The police and all. Why didn’t 
they reconstruct?” 

“Why? Like I said, the original 
reason for cities was gone and the 
cost to rebuild was prohibitive. 
It wouldn’t even be worth while 
trying to clean it up for farm- 
land, or pasture, or whatever. 
Too much debris, too much sheer 
wreckage. Oh, some of the other 
towns have been reconstituted, at 
least partially. Denver and San 
Francisco. But largely, they’ve 
been just left, continuing to de- 
teriorate as the years go by.” 

She looked at him. 

“And with only a few scaven- 
gers, such as ourselves, left in the 
ruins. No electricity, no water, 
no sewage. Nothing.” 

He snorted, tired of the sub- 
ject. “I wouldn’t say exactly 
nothing. We don’t do so badly. 
By the way, I should have some- 
thing to eat before going down 
to Greater Washington.” 

12 



“Caviar, turtle soup, roast 
pheasant, imported British plum 
pudding in brandy sauce, with a 
good French claret to wash it 
down.” 

“I’m tired of that damn caviar.” 
Ill 

M ark Martino drifted in, as 
usual for lunch. He had four 
long-necked bottles in his arms. 
He also had an old-fashioned- 
looking six-shooter low on his 
right hip and an automatic pistol 
at belt level on his left. He look- 
ed surprisingly similar to that 
movie star of yesteryear, Robert 
Taylor, but he wouldn’t have 
known that. 

“Hey, chum-pals,” he said. 
“Get a load of this.” 

“What is it?” Pam said, look- 
ing up from the camp stove 
which sat on the electric range 
in the kitchen. 

“It’s a real BernkasteJer Dok- 
toT und Bratenhofchen Trocken- 
beerenauslese.” 

“Oh great, now I know some- 
thing I didn’t know before.” 
“You, Pamela Rozet, are a 
peasant. This is the greatest of 
Riesling wines.” He took one of 
the bottles and held it up and 
stared at the label and added, un- 
happily, “At least it once was; a 
Riesling shouldn’t really age this 
long. Well, we’ll see how it’s held 
up.”

“Where’d you find it?” Art 
said. 

‘‘You’d never tKinlr in the cel- 
lar of that liquor store on the cor- 
ner of West Third Street.” 

Art said, “I thought that joint 
had Been looted bare years ago.” 
‘‘Evidently, so did everybody 
else,” Mark said. ‘‘But this was 
down in the cellar, under a lot of 
crud that had evidently caved in 
back during the raids and riots. 
There was a whole case of this 
Riesling and some odd and ends 
of cordials. I covered it back over, 
but it won’t do any good.” 
‘‘Why not?” Pam said. ‘‘You 
don’t have any gasoline over in 
your apartment, do you?” 

‘‘A couple of baboons spotted 
me coming out of the place with 
these. They’ll root around till 
they’ve found it. You want me 
to go over and bring you a jerry- 
can?” 

Pam said, ‘‘Please do. I’m just 
about out and haven’t been able 
to find any for a week.” 

Art said, ‘‘Is that why you’re 
all rodded-up? The baboons?” 
Mark, heading for the door, 
said, ‘‘Yeah. They were both 
strangers.” . 

“Oh, hell. Art said. “We’ve 
been having it so easy here for 
months. You’d better tip off Julie 
and Tim.” 

“Already have,” Mark said, 
leaving. 

Art looked at Pam. “Maybe I’d 

14 



better put off taking this paint- 
ing down to the museum.” 

“Why?” she said wearily. “Ba- 
boons and hunters we’ve had be- 
fore. Undoubtedly, we’ll have 
them again. Until ...” she cut 
it off. 

“Until what?” 

“You know. UntU one of these 
days, some baboon, or some himt- 
er kills one or both of us.” 

He didn’t say anything. 

Quddenly it came out in a rush. 
^ “Arthur, we’ve i,ot to get out 
of here. Arthur I’m afraid. I’m an 
awful coward.” 

He let the air out of his lungs 
and came erect from the kitchen 
chair upon which he had been 
sitting. He went over to the win- 
dow and stared down. 

Mark Martino came back with 
the can of gasoline. 

“I don’t know if this is white 
gas, or not,” he said. 

Pam said, “It doesn’t make any 
difference with this stove.” 

Mark said, “I ran into some 
butane in a sports section of a 
department store yesterday. 
Want it?” 

“No, I suppose not. I threw 
the butane stove away. I’m used 
to this gasoline thing now. Not as 
hot, really, but we should be 
able to get gas for some time 
yet.” 

Mark said, “Well, eyen it’s get- 
ting scarce. I haven’t found a 

GALAXY 




car witH any in its tank for a 
coon’s age.” He looked from one 
of them to the other. “Did I in- 
terrupt a fight, or something?” 

Pam said wearily, “No. No, 
not really.” 

Art said, “Pam wants to go 
back to the rat race.” 

She didn’t say anything to 
that. 

Mark said finally, “Well, why 
don’t you? It doesn’t make much 
sense, sta3dng. We three and 
Julie and Tim, are the only ones 
left in this neighborhood.” 

“Why don’t you?” Art said. He 
wasn’t arguing, his voice meant 
that he was actually curious. 

Mark held up one of the green 
bottles he’d brought as his con- 
tribution toward the limch. “You 
know what one of these would 
cost, over on the mainland? That 
is, if you could find it at all.” 

“That couldn’t be enough rea- 
son, even for a lush-head like 
you,” Art said. 

Mark thought about it. He 
said finally, ruefully, “I don’t 
know. Wait a minute, I want to 
get something to read for you.” 
He left again. 

Pam said, “Why does anybody 
stay?” 

Art knew He wasn’t telling her 
anytfiing she didn’t know, but He 
said, “Some are criminals, fugi- 
tives from justice. Some are men- 
tal cases. Some, I suppose, are 
former immigrants, illegal entry 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



immigrants without papers and 
not eligible to apply for tlaiekl 
ten shares of Inalienable Basic, 
if they went over to the raatil- 
land. We lump them all up and 
call them baboons. But the real 
of us? Well, I suppose we’re non- 
conformists, rebels against the 
Ultra-welfare State.” 

“That takes care of everybody 
but me,” Pam said, checking tiSe 
canned pheasant she’d been 
warming up. 

“And you, then?” Art said. 
“Why are you here?” 

“Because you are.” 

There could be no answer. 

TV T ark Martino came in again, 
an age-yellowed paperback 
book in his hand. He was leoldng 
for a place. 

“Listen to this,” he said. “It’s 
from a guy named Arthur C. 
Clarke. Profiles of the Future, 
written back in the sixties.” He 
began reading, “ ‘Civilization can- 
not exist without new frontiers; 
it needs them both physically 
and spiritually. The physical 
need is obvious — new lands, new 
resources, new materials. TBe 
spiritual need is less apparent, 
but in the long run it is more im- 
portant. We do not live by bread 
alone; we need adventure, varie- 
ty, novelty, romance. As the psy- 
chologists have shown by tEeil 
sensory deprivation experiments, 
a man goes swiftly mad if he is

isolated in a silent, darkened 
room, cut off completely from thie 
external world. WHat is true of 
individuals, is also true of socie- 
ties; tliey too can become insane 
witfiqpt sufficient stimulus.* ’* 
Mark tossed tlie book to the 
table. “I guess that’s it. Whatever 
Happened to the yen for adven- 
ture? A hundred years ago Amer- 
icans were pushing West, fighting 
nature, fighting Indians, fighting 
each other over mines, cattle and 
land. When did the dividing line 
come — when we were willing to 
live vicarious adventure, watch- 
ing make-believe Heroes, Holly- 
wood pretty bo5rs, a good many 
of them queers, shoot up the In- 
dians or kill by the scores the 
bad guys, the Nazis or commies, 
the Russians and Chinese? Why 
did we leave it to the Norwegians 
to crew the Kon-Tiki, and for 
the British and Sherpas to first 
scale Everest? We’ve become a 
bunch of gutless wonders, sitting 
in front of our Tri-Vision sets. 
The biggest frustration, the great 
tragedy of our current age is the 
new Central Production ban on 
using cereals for beer or booze.” 
Art said sourly, “That won’t be 
a frustration long. I understand 
that they came up with a new 
sort of combination tranquilizer 
and euphoric. Going to issue it 
so cheaply that it’ll be nearly 
free. Non-habit forming, suppos- 
edly no hangover, no bad effects. 
16 



Keeps you perpetually happy, in 
a kind of perpetual daze. Even 
the children can have it. They 
call it trank.” 

“What’ll they think of next?” 
Mark marveled sarcastically. 
“Talk about bread and circuses. 
The Roman plutocracy never had 
it so good; they gave the prole- 
tariat a sadistic show and free 
wheat. But time marches on, and 
now we’ve got the credit from 
Inalienable Basic, twenty-four 
hour a day Tri- Vision, teevee li- 
brary and music banks, and . 
what did you call it?” 

“Trank,” Art said. He looked 
at his friend strangely. “So you 
stay on here for the adventure. 
You with your big collection of 
gims. You with your prowling 
aroimd the ruins looking for 
fancy booze and the like, hoping 
that the baboons or Himters will 
jump you. Hell, you’re just a 
hunter yourself.” 

Mark was irritated and defen- 
sive. “I’m not himter” Maybe I 
like the adventure Here, the 
chances you take just surviving, 
but I’m no Hunter. I live Here, 
this is my home. I defend myself. 
Maybe I even get my kicks out of 
getting into situations where I 
have to use my speed and my 
wits, but I never pick the fight, 
and I most certainly Have never 
shot an unarmed baboon in the 
back the way these damned 
hunters will.” 



GAIAXY 




Pam began to set the food on 
the table. “Then what’s the real 
reason for being here, Mark — 
aside from the adventure?” 

IV 

H e pretended he had to think 
about it, even as he helped 
her put out the elaborate silver- 
ware Art had liberated from the 
ruins of Tiffany’s years before. 

He reached into a pocket and 
brought forth the durable plastic 
which was his Universal Credit 
Card. “I object to this being 
closer to me than my soul,” he 
said. “My number, issued me at 
birth and from which I can never 
escape, even after death. A com- 
bination of what was once Social 
Security number, driver’s license, 
bank account number, voter’s 
registration, even telephone num- 
ber and post office box number. 
It’s everything. Regimentation 
carried to the ultimate. We 
thought the commies and Nazis 
had regimentation. Zoroaster! 
The computers know everything 
there is to know about me, from 
before I was born to long after 
I’m dead — they keep the records 
in their files forever. When my 
great-grandchildren want to have 
children, the computers will 
check back on good old Mark 
Martino for genetic purposes. 
Oh, swell. Talk about being a 
cog in a machine, hell, we’re more 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



nearly like identical grains of 
sand on a beach.” 

He held up his wrist to show 
his teevee phone. “Why I carry 
this, I don’t know. I’ve always 
got it switched on Priority One, 
and there are only three persons 
on Earth eligible to break in on 
me on Priority One. But look at 
this thing. With the coming of 
the satellite relays and interna- 
tional communications integrated, 
I can literally, and for practical- 
ly no expense, talk to anybody 
on Earth. Even if the poor cloddy 
is half way up Moimt Fuji in 
Japan. There’s no escape. In the 
eld days, the cost of phoning a 
friend, relative, business contact 
or whoever got on the prohibi- 
tive side when it was long dis- 
tance, or especially international. 
Not now. For pennies, you can 
talk to anyone in the world. But 
the trouble is, it works both ways 
— they can talk to you.” 

Art laughed. “I seldom wear 
my wrist phone. And even the 
portable, in the next room, is al- 
ways on Priority Two.” 

Mark growled, “That won’t 
Kelp you if it’s a government bul- 
letin or something. You’re on tap, 
every minute of the day. How’d 
you like to be a Tri-Vision sex 
S3Tmbol or some other entertain- 
ment star? If one of them dared 
lower their priority to, say, five, 
they’d have a billion teevee phone 
calls come in within hours.”

'pam said, “All riglit, all rigHt, 
^ let’s eat. Get ttie cork out of 
one of tSose bottles, Art, and 
let’s sample tHe latest loot So 
you’re in revolt against modem 
society, Mark, so all riglit. At 
least you don’t refuse to spend 
your dividends from your Inal- 
ienable Basic, tHe way Art does. 
And your royalties must accumu- 
late so tHat when you make tHose 
sin-trips of yours over to Nueva 
Las Vegas, or wherever, you must 
Have quite a bit of credit on 
hand.” 

“Sin tripsl” Mark protested. 
Holding his right hand over his 
heart as though' in injured inno- 
cence. “How can you say that? 
It’s called research'.” 

“Hal” Art snorted. 

“No jolly,” Mark said. “I’ve 
got to keep up some touch. Have 
to know wHat they’re listening to 
in the dives, both' high and low. 
It’s all very well to Have two 
or three semi-classics in the mu- 
sic banks, but you’ve got to be 
continually turning out new stuff, 
if you really want to hit the jack- 
pot some day.” 

“Semi-classics,” Art snorted. 
“7 love Mother in the Springtime, 
I love Mother in the Fall.” 

Mark said reasonably, “It’s 
what they want. Art. If you’d 
paint what they wanted, maybe 
you’d be selling better. RigHt 
now, they’re going througH a 
1920’s-1930’s revival bit. Swell. I 
18 



sit at my teevee phone and play 
over and over the so-called Hit 
Parade tunes, and over and over 
I listen to the old Bing 
Crosby and even Rudy Val- 
lee tapes. 

“And then pretty soon, just 
about when I’m ready to start 
tearing my hair out, some- 
thing comes to me. I sit down to 
the piano. I beat it out. Some- 
times the whole thing is done in 
an hour. Writing the l 3 rrics is the 
hardest part.” 

Pam said interestedly, “Then 
what happens, Mark?” 

“Well, there’s various ways. If 
you’re a second rater, like me, 
your best bet is to get in touch 
with a slick to act as middleman, 
expediter or whatever you want 
to call him. He gets one of the 
stars, such as Truman Love ...” 

“Truman Love,” Art protested. 
“Is there really a singer with a 
name like that?” 

“Of course. I tell you. Art, the 
mental caliber of the Tri- Vision 
and teevee fan is halving each 
year that goes by. They don’t 
want to be bothered thinking 
even a tiny bit. A sloppy mopsy 
who likes to listen to sentimental 
slush about love can remember 
a name like Truman Love. It 
sticks with her. She knows very 
well, before she dials one of his 
songs, what it’s going to be like. 
With a name like that, it couldn’t 
be anything else.” 



GALAXY 




tC'A 11 riglit, all rigHt, so tiie 
slick gets Tnoman Love to 
sing your song.” 

‘‘Okay. We record it and pay 
tfie small amount involved in 
placing it in the music banks. If 
the slick is any good, he gets 
some publicity. One of the gossip 
commentators, one of the live 
comedians, that sort of thing. In 
the banks, it’s filed under name 
of singer, name of song, type of 
song, band leader, name of band, 
name of eacK musician in the 
band, subject of song — sucK as 
love, mother, patriotism, chil- 
dren, that sort of thing — and 
finally, surprise, surprise, the 
writer or writers of the song.” 
“So,” Art supplied, “whoever 
dials and plays it pays a small 
royalty.” 

“Very small,” Mark said, nod- 
ding. “Differs for a single home 
teevee phone screen, or for, say, 
some live Tri-Vision show in- 
volving a band. If you’re lucky, 
the song takes and maybe some 
more singers and bands want to 
record it. At any rate, you split 
the take four ways.” 

“Four ways?” Pam said. “You, 
the singer, the slick and who?” 
“The recording company. They 
usually take one fourth', too. 
They split their quarter between 
the company, the band leader and 
all members of the band.” 

Art shook his head. “By the 
time the drummer gets his slice, 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



it must be pretty small potatoes.’* 
“Not if it’s played a few bil- 
lion times,” Mark said. “Besides, 
maybe I write a possible song 
once a month. He probably does 
a recording as often as once or 
twice a day. He might have liter- 
ally thousands of tunes record- 
ed, with his getting a tiny per- 
centage of each.” 

“It’s not as bad as newspa- 
pers,” Pam said. “Reading a 
newspaper on your teevee phone 
will cost you ten cents. It has to 
be prorated among possibly a 
hundred journalists, columnists, 
editors and what have you. That 
means that on an average, each 
newspaperman involved gets pos- 
sibly one mill, a tenth pf a cent, 
per reading. Not even that, since 
the owners of the paper take 
their cut off the top.” 

A rt said, shaking his head and 
digging into the pheasant, 
“What in the name of the holy 
living Zoroaster did they do be- 
fore computers?” 

“Well, they didn’t handle it 
this way,” Mark said. He looked 
at Art and changed the subject. 
“You’re going down to Greater 
Washington this afternoon?” 
“Yeah. I want to register this 
painting. I’ll be back in a few 
hours. You’ll keep an eye on 
Pam, won’t you?” 

“Of course. UH . you have 
duplication and registration fee?” 

19 




Art looked at him, puzzled. 

Mark said hurriedly, “I mean, 
wdthout dipping into your divi- 
dends. I know you refuse t« spend 
them.”’ 

Art went back to his food. 

“Don’t be so touchy,” Mark 
said. “What I meant was, if you 
were a little short, you could al- 
ways pay me back later.” 

Art said, “You know damn well 
I couldn’t use your dollar credits 
to register my painting anyway. 
Nobody can spend your credits 
but you. Or do you want me to 
carry not only your credit card 
with me but your right thumb as 
well, for the print?” 

Mark chuckled. “There are 
ways of getting aroimd anything. 
I found some ancient coins in the 
wreckage of a numismatist’s sHop 
the other day. You could take 
them to Greater Washington, sell 
them and have the amount cred- 
ited to your acCount. Then use 
it,” 

“Thanks just the same,” Art 
said tightly. “But I pay my own 
way, Mark. When I can’t pay my 
own way by selling my paintings 
any longer. I’ll give up my art 
and find some other kind of 
work.” 

“Well, it’s more than I can 
say. I’m always in here sponging 
off you people.” 

Pam laughed at that. “Half 
the things we have here came 
from you. Why you’re the one 
20 



who found the bombshelter, 
even.” 

T he subject was safely changed. 

Mark said, “By the way, 
how’s the bombshelter holding 
out?” 

“We’re putting a sizeable dent 
in it,” Pam said. “I think I’m go- 
ing to ask you boys to try and 
scout out some things not quite 
so exotic. A few cases of baked 
beans, corn, string beans and 
what have you. I’m beginning to 
get a permanent sour stomach 
from all this rich stuff. Which 
reminds me. I’m going to have to 
take a trip to the mainland, as 
soon as my dividends come in 
for next month, to load up on 
some fresh fruits and vegetables.” 
Mark said, “Why don’t we 
make an expedition of it? Tim 
and Julie too. Both for the man- 
power to carry things, and for 
protection.” 

Art said, “What time is it?” 
Mark dialed his wrist phone 
and said, “What time is it?” 

A tinny voice responded, 
“When the bell sounds, it will be 
thirteen hours and thirteen min- 
utes.” A tiny bell sounded. 

“Oh, »h,” Art said, “I better 
get the damn painting wrapped 
and get going or I won’t be back 
before dark.” 

“Listen,” Pam said anxiously. 
“Don’t you dare walk the streets 
that late. If you’re held up, you 

GALAXY 




stay in an auto-hotel on the 
mainland.” 

“I haven’t enough dollar cred- 
it,” he growled. 

“You have lots of dollars in 
your 'credit balance.” 

“I mean my own credit.” 

She rolled her eyes upward. 
“You must be driving the compu- 
ters crazy with all that unspent 
credit you’ve accumulated. They 
probably can’t figure out why, 
if you aren’t using it currently, 
you don’t buy Variable Basic 
stock, something to build up your 
portfolio and bring in more earn- 
ings.” 

“Earningsl” he snorted, coming 
to his feet"and tossing his beauti- 
ful linen napkin — looted long 
months since from the wreckage 
of Macy’s — to the table. “How 
can shares of stock, just sitting 
there, make any earnings? Only 
work earns anything.” 

V 

ji rthur Halleck, his wrapped 
painting clumsily under 
his arm, a sawed-off, dou- 
ble-barrelled shotgun slung over 
his shoulders, peddled Kis bike 
up McDougal to West Third 
Street and turned right He ped- 
dled the five streets over to 
Broadway, expertly zig-zagging 
in between the abandoned cars 
and trucks and debris. Broadway, 
being wider, was clearer. He 
22 



turned left and tried to speed it 
up a bit 

It would have made more 
sense for them to have lived cl»s- 
er to the Grand Central vacuum- 
tube terminal, but they stubborn- 
ly hung on to staying in the Vil- 
lage. It was a matter of principle, 
in a way. The last of the artists, 
staying in the last of the art cal- 
onies. All five of them. He and 
Pam, Mark, Tim the poet and his 
girl Julie who long years ago had 
been a model. 

However, the further up town 
you got, the more hunters you ran 
into. They were too lazy to hike 
all the way down to Greenwich 
Village. Too lazy, and largely too 
timid. These empty streets, with 
all the windows, all the roof tops, 
all the doorways, any of which 
might shelter an armed baboon 
or even a fellow hunter, a bit an 
the trigger-happy side; these 
empty streets would give even a 
well armed, bullet-proof clothed 
hunter the willies. 

He peddled up Broadway, 
keeping a weather eye peeled, 
right and left to Union Square. 
He was in more danger from a 
hunter — assuming there were 
any on the island today — than 
he was from a baboon. Most of 
the baboons that hung out in this 
area knew him, and there was 
more or less of a gentleman’s 
agreement not to bother each 
ether. There was no percentage 

GALAXY 




in it, for tHat matter. They knew 
he wasn’t worth jumping, that 
he didn’t have anything worth 
risking a life for. Besides that, 
the shotgun over his shoulder 
was a great deterrent. There’s 
something about a shotgun load- 
ed with buckshot. Man in his 
time has evolved some exotic 
weapons for close-quarters com- 
bat, but there’s something about 
a sawed-off shotgun. The bearer 
doesn’t even have to be a good 
shot; in fact, he can be full of 
lead, his eyes beginning to go 
glazed, and still point it and pull 
the hair-trigger and accomplish 
one tremendous amoimt of re- 
venge. 

At Madison Square, he turned 
right and headed up Fifth'. At the 
library, he left the bike for a mo- 
ment, went inside through the 
side door which was still unblock- 
ed, and stashed his shotgun away 
in the place where he usually 
left it. 

He was unarmed now, but it 
was only a couple of blocks. He 
peddled over to the Grand Cen- 
tral Terminal and to where the 
police had their booth'. There had 
been rumors that even this last 
vacuum-tube terminal on all 
Manhattan was going to be dis- 
continued, but he doubted it. In 
spite of the supposed desertion 
of the whole island, there were 
still reasons for occaaonal visits 
— sometimes in considerable

strength. Like last year when the 
delegation from Mexico City 
came up to mine the Metropoli- 
tan Museum of Fine Arts of its 
treasure of Aztec artifacts. They 
recovered quite a bit, too, so he 
had heard. The looters earlier 
hadn’t been interested in much 
except gold and obviously sophis- 
ticated art objects that were im- 
mediately saleable. 

T here were two police at the 
tube entry. He knew one of 
them slightly. He’d been here for 
a long time. He must have gone 
back to the old days, and Art 
Halleck wondered why he hadn’t 
retired. His name was Williams, 
or something; or maybe it was 
William, though that almost in- 
variably becomes Bill on the level 
at which they met. 

They shook him down, the 
Other cop being a little more 
thorough than Williams. 

Williams said, “He’s all right,” 
but the other didn’t pay much 
attention. 

“Got a gun?” he said. 

“No,” Art said patiently. 

The other snorted and con- 
tinued to touch him where a man 
keeps a weapon. 

“I said I didn’t have a gun,” 
Art said. “I know it’s against the 
rules for me to carry a gun with- 
out a special permit, even in this 
town.” 

Williams said, “He’s an old 

23 




hand. He hides his gun a block 
or so away before he comes here.” 

The new guard said, “What’s in 
the package?” 

“A painting. I’m an artist.” 

The. other snorted disbelief. 
“Let’^ see it.” 

Art’s lips began to go white. 

Williams said, “I’ve known him 
for a long time. He’s a painter. 
Lives down in the Village.” 

The new guard said, “How 
do we know he hasn’t scroimged 
some old master or something? 
Something that oughta be turned 
over to the national museum.” 

Art drew in his breath, and a 
muscle in his right cheek began 
to tic. 

Williams said, “Look, Walt, if 
you want to open up his package, 
you can open up his package. 
However, if he had a Michelan- 
gelo in there, do you think he’d 
just amble up to us like this? 
Wouldn’t he find himself a boat 
and ferry it over some dark 
night?” 

Walt grumbled, “Well, if you 
say so. But it seems to me you 
take it awfully easy with these 
people.” 

“Like I said, I’ve known him 
a long time.” To Art he said, 
soothingly, “How’s that nice Miss 
Pamela?” 

“She’s all right,” Art said. And 
then more graciously, “She’s get- 
ting a lot of work done on her 
book. In a day -or so, we’ll be go- 
24 



ing over to get some fresh things.” 

The new guard named Walt, 
still miffed, said, “What’d you 
mean fresh things? What do you 
eat, ordinarily? Looting’s forbid- 
den.” 

Art looked at him. “Ordinarily, 
we eat the stuff we still have left 
over in the kitchen cabinet and 
the refrigerator from before the 
time when the cops chickened out 
on the job and pulled off the is- 
land.” 

“Why you . ” 

“Okay, okay, you two,” Wil- 
liams said, getting between them. 
“Loosen up. You’re both nice 
guys. Stop roaching each other. 
Walt McGivem, this is Art Hal- 
leck. If Walt’s on this detail very 
long, he’ll probably be seeing you 
from time to time. Art.” 

VI 

T T^alt McGivem grunted some- 
^ ^ thing sourly and turned and 
walked off. 

Art said, “What’s roaching 
him?” 

The older policeman said, 
“This isn’t considered the most 
desirable detail around.” 

Art picked up his painting, 
preparatory to going on. “Then 
why do you stick it out, Wil- 
liams?” 

“Why do you?” 

“I asked you first. But I can 
live here without paying rent, 

GALAXY 




or practically anything else.” 

The police guard chuckled 
wryly. But then he drew in his 
breath and said, “I was bom a 
few blocks from Here, son.” That 
wasn’t quite enough, so he add- 
ed, “I wasn’t here during the 
few bad days. When I came 
back, the famiily was gone. I 
never found out how, or why, 
or where, or anything else. Hell, 
the whole neighborhood was 
gone.” 

“Sorry,” Art said. “I shouldn’t 
have asked.” 

“All right, son. The thing is, 
there aren’t many folks left. In 
fact, practically none. I wish 
you and that nice Pamela girl 
would go on over to the main- 
land. However, as long as there 
are any decent people left at 
all, I kind of like to be here.” 

“The last of the neighborhood 
cops,” Art muttered. 

“What?” 

“Nothing.” 

Art started off again, but at 
that moment two newcomers 
emerged from the tube entry. 

Art came to a halt and eyed 
them up and down, deliberate- 
ly as they approached the police 
booth. 

He stared the first one full in 
the face and said, “You look 
like a couple of jokers out of a 
Tri- Vision show about hunters 
on Safari in Africa — you mop- 
sy-monger.” 

AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



The man’s eyes bugged. “You 
. you can’t talk to me that 
way, you . you cheap ba- 
boon!” 

Art sneered at him. “I’m no 
baboon. Maybe the last of the 
bohemians, but I’m no baboon. 
I’ve got all my papers. I’m le- 
gal. There’s no law against liv- 
ing on Manhattan — if you don’t 
go around armed.” He took in 
the other’s automatic-recoiless 
rifle, and the heavy pistol at his 
waist, and then added, “You 
sonofabitch.” 

The newcomer turned quick- 
ly to Williams, who was inspect- 
ing the papers the two had hand- 
ed him. 

“Arrest this man!” he snap- 
ped. 

Williams looked up, wide- 
eyed. “What’d he do?” 

“He slandered me. I demand 
you arrest him.” 

“I didn’t hear him say any- 
thing,” Williams said evenly. 

^^he other newcomer came up. 

He was quieter, less lardy 
and less pompous than his com- 
panion, but he said to Art cold- 
ly. “Let me see your Uni-Credit 
Card.” 

“Go to hell, you mopsy-mon- 
gering hunter.” 

The other drew forth his own 
Uni-Credit Card and flashed it 
to Williams. “I want a complete 
police report on this man.”

Walt McGivem came up. 
“WKat’s going on?” 

TKe second of th'e two hunt- 
ers said coldly, “I’m Harry 
Kank, Inter-American Bureau of 
Investigation. Get me an imme- 
diate police report on this man.” 

Williams sighed and said, 
“Let me have your Universal 
Credit Card, Art.” But then he 
amended that, looking defiantly 
at the newcomers. “I mean, Mr. 
Halleck.” 

Art’s lips were white, but He 
reached into an inner pocket 
and brought it forth. All five of 
them entered the police booth. 

Williams put the card in the 
teevee phone slot and said, “Po- 
lice record, please.” 

Within seconds a robot-like 
voice began, “Arthur LeRoy Hal- 
leck. At age of sixteen arrested 
for participating in peace demon- 
stration, without permit to pa- 
rade. Released. At age of twenty, 
arrested by traffic authorities 
for driving a floater manually 
while under the influence of al- 
cohol. Suspended driver’s license 
for one year. At age of twenty- 
five, arrested for assault and 
battery. Charge dropped by vic- 
tim. No further police record. 
Now believed to be living on the 
island of Manhattan, on Mc- 
Dougal Street with Pamela Ro- 
zet, out of wedlock.” The robot 
voice came to a halt, then said, 
“Are details required?” 

26 



Williams looked at the man 
who had named himself Harry 
Kank. 

The Bureau of Investigation 
man said to Art, testily, “Whiat 
was that assault and battery 
charge?” 

Art said, “I slugged a man 
who made a snide remark about 
my paintings. He apologized 
later. Now he’s a friend of mine. 
Want to get him on the phone?” 

Kank glared at him, imspeak- 
ing for a moment Then he snap- 
ped to Williams, "I suspect this 
man of being incompetent to 
handle his own affairs. Give me 
a credit check on him.” 

Williams opened his mouth, 
then closed it with a sigh'. He 
said into the teevee phone, “Bal- 
ance Check on this card.” 

Within seconds a robot voice 
said, “Ten shares. Inalienable 
Basic. No shares Variable Basic.” 

The two hunters snorted. 

The robot voice went on, 
“Current cash credit, fourteen 
thousand, four hundred and for- 
ty-five dollars and sixty-three 
cents.” 

The eyes of the two bugged. 

Kank snapped, “Get that 
again. There must be some mis- 
take.” 

Williams, also visibly taken 
aback, repeated his demand of 
the balance check on Art Hel- 
leck’s account. It came out the 
same.

T Ke Bureau of Investigation 
man’s eyes were colder still, 
now. He said, “Where did you 
accumulate that much credit? 
Have you been looting, here on 
the island and selling what you 
find to dealers on the mainland?” 
Art said contemptuously. “Of 
that credit balance, I figure sev- 
enty-three dollars and some odd 
cents are mine. The rest belongs 
to the government of the United 
States of the Americas, as far 
as I’m concerned.” ” 

All were staring at him now. 
Art said, “I haven’t touched 
my dividends from my ten shares 
of Inalienable Basic for years. 
I don’t want them. The seventy- 
three dollars is mine. It repre- 
sents money I’ve taken in selling 
my paintings. If there was any 
way of giving the dividends 
back to the damn Ultra-welfare 
State, I would. But evidently 
there isn’t. I can’t even donate 
them to charity. There isn’t any 
such thing, any more — except 
the one big, mopsy-mongering 
charity.” 

All four of them were still 
staring disbelief. 

“You must be crazy,” the first 
of the two hunters blurted. 

But Kank came to a sudden 
decision and snapped at Wil- 
liams, “If you’re through with 
our papers, let me have them. 
As you’ll note, we have permis- 
sion to search various buildings 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



in the Wall Street area for cer- 
tain lost records. Do you have 
an armored floated available?” 

“Well, yes sir.” 

“Very well. I’ll requisition it.” 
Harry Kank turned back to Art 
and stared at him. “Possibly we 
will see each other again . 
baboon.” 

“I’m not a baboon . hunt- 
er,” Art sneered at him. “I see 
you know our terminology, here 
on the island. Undoubtedly, you 
have been here before. Undoubt- 
edly, with some similar trumped- 
up reason for prowling around, 
armed to the teeth. Maybe we 
will see each other again — you 
sonofabitch.” 

The high police official glared 
at him, but spim on his heel and, 
with his plumper companion, fol- 
lowed after Walt McGivem. 

Williams and Art stood there 
a moment, looking after them. 

Williams said bitterly, “Some 
cop. 

Art growed lowly, “Why can't 
something be done about those 
lousy funkers?” 

Williams said, “You know as 
well as I do. There’s no law in 
this city. Citizens who live Here, 
or enter it, waive all legal pro- 
tection. But anybody with pull 
can get special permission to 
come in armed, supposedly for 
some gobbledygook reason such' 
as to search the library, or some 
museum, for something lost. Ha! 

27 




Not one cloddy out of ten Kas 
any real legitimate reason. They 
come to thrill hunt. The ruined 
cities are the only place I know 
of in the world where you can 
legally shoot a man, woman or 
child and not even report it, if 
you don’t want to bother. If you 
do bother, you report it as self- 
defense.” 

Walt McGivem was turning 
the armored police floater over 
to the two hunters. 

Art said, in disgust still, “I 
better get going. Thanks, Wil- 
liams.” 

Williams looked at him. 
“Thanks for what?” 

Art headed for the entry to 
the vacuum-tube transport ter- 
minal. 

VII 

B ack at the apartment house 
on McDougal street, Pam and 
Mark were still lingering over 
their coffee. In fact, in spite of 
the hour, Mark had gone to his 
own apartment and returned 
with a bottle of Napoleon bran- 
dy, the last of a case he had 
found in a ruined penthouse, 
some months ago. 

They drank the coffee black 
and sipped at the cognac from 
enormous snifter glasses which 
had been liberated from Tiffany’s 
at the same time as her silver- 
ware. 

28 



Pam looked distastefully at the 
remnants of their mid-day meal. 
“I’m getting awfully tired of this 
canned food,” she said. “What is 
there about eating that makes 
you really prefer not something 
like pressed duck under glass 
with orange sauce, but the kind 
of codfish gravy on toast that 
you used to eat in your poverty- 
stricken home as a kid?” 

Mark chuckled, “Or some 
pasta. Spaghetti or otherwise, 
such as your mother used to 
make herself. None of this store 
boughten stuff. And precious lit- 
tle to put over it save a bit of 
tomato sauce and, when you were 
lucky, some grated cheese.” 
Pam said, “Whoever stocked 
that bombshelter must have own- 
ed half of Fort Knox. He put in 
enough caviar and smoked sal- 
mon to last a regiment until any 
possible contamination from a 
nuclear bombing was gone. I nev- 
er thought I’d get’ to the point 
where I got fed up with caviar.” 
Mark said laughingly, “I nev- 
er even tasted it, until after the 
city was abandoned. My first re- 
action was that it tasted like 
fish eggs.” 

She laughed at him. But then 
she said, “What in the world 
ever happened to cooking?” 

He thought about it. “Like ev- 
ery other art, I suppose, or hand- 
icraft or skill for that matter. 
What cobbler could take pride 

GALAXY 




In siiending a few days on a 
pair of fiandmade ^oes tHat fiad 
taken Kitn Half a life time in ap- 
prenticesliip to learn to make, 
wfien tEe potential customer 
could go down and buy a pair 
made in an automated factory 
tHat were altnosi as good and 
cost a fraction of wHat he Had 
to charge? It was easier for the 
cobbler to go down to tHe factory 
and get a thirty-Eour-a-week job. 
Or, if none was available, to go 
on relief; or later, to live on his 
Inalienable Basic handout.” 

OKe frowned. “Well, tHat ap- 
plies to the cobbler, but 
not ...” 

“Not to an artist?” He grinned 
lit her. Same thing. The idea 
of saving time, of devoting as 
much of your day to recreation, 
leisure, play, permeated our 
whole society. Cooking? A woman 
is considered mad to do such' 
things as bake her own bread 
imd pastry, cut up her own veg- 
etables, learn how to trim her 
own meat. You saved so much 
lime buying bakery bread, can- 
ned vegetables, frozen meat all 
neatly cut and packaged so that 
vou never realized that it had 
once come off an animal. The 
fact that it simply didn’t taste 
the same wasn’t nearly as good 
iind wasn’t as nutrious, either, 
wns allowed to go by the board. 
Slie saved time. What did she do 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



with it? Sat and watched TVg 
er now, Tri-Vision. Supposedly^ 
sEe was being saved from drudg-> 
ery, not art. But cooking is a4 
art, and art takes time.” 

Pam was uncomfortable. SSfl 
said, “Do you expect me t» 
bake bread? I’m a writer. I don’t 
want to spend eight hours a day 
cooking.” 

Mark Martino laughed. ‘Wfio 
am I to throw the first stone? 
You’ve heard some of the songil 
I write. They’re a continual re- 
hash’ of popular songs that were 
written and have been rewritten 
over and over for the better part 
of the past century.” 

“Why don’t you try something 
more serious?” 

“I have. Every clown wants to 
play Hamlet. Off and on I’ve 
been working on a light opera 
for nearly a year. It’ll never be 
produced. People don’t want 
even light opera today. It takes, 
a bit of education to enjoy. 
Anybody can understand ' that 
perennial favorite I wrote, I 
Love Mother in the Springtime. 
It’s not just musicians. Look at 
poetry, you who are a writer. In 
the old days a poet used to sweat 
turning out a sonnet, say. Very 
difficult form. Exactly fourteen 
lines, all of them hung together 
with rhyme, rKsrthm, meter, per- 
fectly. It was too much work for 
the poet, so blank verse and then 
free verse came in. And then an- 

29 




arcKy. The new poet never both- 
ered learn how to construct a 
sonnet, nor to measure his lines 
in correct meter and to follow a 
rhythm system. He dashed off 
his inspired ^oem in a matter 
of a half hour and was surprised 
when after a few decades of this 
people stopped reading poetry.” 

[TT e thought about it for a min- 
ute. “Same as in art. What 
happened to the painter who used 
to serve an apprenticeship of 
years learning the tools of his 
trade? Our Art Halleck is the 
Only painter I’ve even heard of 
for years who bothered to learn 
to draw. Too much work.” 

“I suppose it permeates our 
whole society,” Pam said, nod- 
ding. “Nobody takes pride in his 
work any more.” ” 

“How can you, under present 
circumstances? Take my origin- 
al example, that cobbler. He 
made shoes, from beginning to 
end, and when the job was 
through he could look at them 
and say, ‘There is the product of 
my efforts. I did a good job. 
Put the same man in a fac- 
tory turning out Half a million 
pairs of shoes a day. His job, 
which he can handle dressed in a 
suit and wearing white shirt and 
tie, consists of staring at various 
dials and screens and occasion- 
ally throwing a switch’, or check- 
ing a report. He never sees the 
30 



leather, he never sees a pair of 
the completed product. How can 
he take pride in his work?” 

She said slowly, “Well, in some 
fields the new system has its ad- 
vantages. People’s Capitalism, I 
mean.” 

“Like, for instance?” he said 
sceptically. 

“Well, I was interested earlier 
in your description of how a mu- 
sical composer is rewarded for 
his efforts. In the long run, it’s 
based on how his songs are re- 
ceived. I think it’s even better 
for the free lance writer.” 

“It’s basically the same, isn’t 
it?” 

“There are variations. For in- 
stance, in the old da3rs, a writer 
did, say, a novel. Good. When it 
was finished, he submitted it to 
a publishing house and an edi- 
tor read it — at least, we hope 
he did. Possibly it never got to 
an editor. If the writer was an 
unknown, perhaps his novel was 
read, or quickly scanned, by a 
poorly paid reader who possibly 
didn’t really have the qualifica- 
tions to understand the book. 
All right, but suppose an edi- 
tor did read it and liked it. By 
the way, many of these editors 
were frustrated writers who 
couldn’t make the grade, but 
here they were in a position to ac- 
cept or reject some hopeful’s 
work. They hadn’t made it but 
they were now in a position to 

GALAXY 




criticize somebody else’s writing. 
Anyway even after you got past 
tHe editor, that wasn’t all. You 
might get a letter from him say- 
ing, ‘I like it fine, but unfortun- 
ately this publishing house ob- 
jects to protagonists being an- 
archists, or matricides, or homo- 
sexuals,’ or whatever their vari- 
ous taboos might be.” 

■JVyTark laughed sourly. “Well, it 
was their publishing com- 
pany they could decide what 
they wanted to publish and what 
they didn’t.” 

“Yes. That’s my complaint. 
You see, we had freedom of the 
press. You could write anything 
you wanted. Getting it printed 
was another thing. You had to 
find some publishing company, 
or newspaper, or magazine or 
whatever, who wanted to print 
it. If you couldn’t locate one, 
then you still had the option of 
printing it yourself. Unfortun- 
ately, few writers had enough 
money to start their own pub- 
lishing house or magazine.” 

“I see your point.” 

“Ummm. Today, I write a 
book and take it to the nearest 
library and for a small amount 
of money I have it set up and 
registered in the national com- 
puter library files. It’s registered 
by title, cross registered by au- 
thor, subject, and whether it’s 
fiction, non-fiction, juvenile, or 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



whatever. Even the reviews are 
available to the potchtial reader. 
And reviewers and critics we 
shall always have with us.” 
“Amen. But suppose nebedj^ 
wants to read it?” 

“The same thing happens as 
happened before with writers. 
You don’t make any money. But 
if somebody does want to read it, 
he pays a nominal sum to have 
it projected on his teevee phene 
screen library bo(^ster. If it be- 
comes a best seller, he makes a 
great deal. There might be heles 
in the system, but at least you 
aren’t subject to the whims of 
editors and publishers. Anybody 
willing to sacrifice the compar- 
atively small amount, about fif- 
ty dollars for the average length 
novel, can have his work present- 
ed to the public.” 

Mark said, “I’d think there’d 
be one hell of a large number of 
books each year.” 

“There are. But fiiere’s no lim- 
its to the number that the K- 
brary banks can contain, after 
all. Another good thing is ^at 
every book ever printed remains 
in the banks — forever. Noth- 
ing ever goes out of print. It may 
go out of demand, practically 
everything does, sooner or later, 
but nothing goes out of print. 
The books I’m writing today 
will be available a thousand 
years from now, if anybody 
wanted to bother to read them.” 

31 




■jVyTark Martino said grudging-. 

ly, “I suppose tKe tlimg is 
that anybody can afford to go in> 
to the arts today. WKetfier any- 
body reads His books, bu 3 rs 1^ 
paintings, of listens to lus music 
is anotHer thing. THat is still in 
th'e laps of tHe gods, as it al- 
ways was. But at least you can 
make your fling.” 

“TKafs right,” Pam sighed, 
coming to her feet. “I suppose 
I’d better throw these disposable 
plates out the window. A wom- 
an’s work is never done.” 
Mark stood too. “I ate too 
much,” he aimounced. “And that 
cognac didn’t Help any. I think 
I’ll take a nap. Listen, Pam, if 
you decide to go out, bang on 
the door. I’ll tag along, just for 
luck.” 

“Looking for adventure?” she 
said in deprecation. 

He scowled at her. “I was lay- 
ing that on a bit. It’s not the 
only reason I stick around here 
on Manhattan, of course.” 

She was uncomfortable and 
stared down at the toe of Her 
Etruscan revival sandal. 

He said softly, “As you prob- 
ably know, I’m really here for 
the same reason you are, Pam- 
ela.” 

She didn’t say anything. 

Mark said, “Art’s a friend of 
mine. But if anything ever Hap- 
pens between you two ...” 
“Have a good nap, Mark.” 

32 



VIII 

Art Halleck went on down in- 
to the vacuum-tube terminal. 
He had to take a two-seater 
since the larger carriers seldom 
came through tQs deserted spot. 
He stuck the painting in behind 
the seat and climbed in himself 
and brought the canopy over his 
head and dropped the pressur- 
izer. He remembered the coor- 
dinates from the many times he 
Had made the trip and dialed 
right through to the offices of 
the duplicator at the National 
Museum. 

It might Have been slightly 
cheaper if he Had taken his two- 
seater to the pseudo-city of 
Princeton and from there taken 
a twenty-seater to Greater 
Washington. But that would have 
meant changing from two-seater 
to twenty-seater at Princeton, 
changing back again to a two- 
seater once he had arrived at the 
terminal in the capital. Too much 
time. He wanted to get back to 
Greenwich Village, before dark. 
It was no good leaving Pam 
there alone, even though Mark 
v/as in the same building. 

When the destination light 
flickered, he released the pres- 
surizer and threw the canopy 
back and climbed out into the 
reception room of the Office of 
Duplication. He pulled the paint- 
ing out from behind the seat and 

GALAXY 




went to tHe reception desk. The 
door of the vacuum tube closed 
behind him. 

He said into the reception 
screen, “Arthur Halleck requests 
immediate appointment to dup- 
licate and register a painting.” 

The voice said, “Room 23. Mr. 
Ben MacFarlane.” 

Art knew MacFarlane. The 
other had handled Art’s work 
before. He was a man who dab- 
bled in painting himself, evi- 
dently not very successfully or he 
wouldn’t have foimd it neces- 
sary to augment his dividends 
from his Inalienable Basic by 
holding down a job like this. Not 
that he wasn’t lucky to have been 
able to get a job. 

Art made his way down a cor- 
ridor with which he was highly 
familiar, to Duplicating Room 
23. There seemed to be no one 
else around, but, come to think 
of it, the last time he had been 
here he had spotted only one 
other artist hopefuL Only a few 
years ago, you could have ex- 
pected to see half a dozen or 
more. Evidently as time went by 
fewer and fewer would-be art- 
ists were trying to sell their 
stuff. He wondered vaguely if it 
was a matter of trying to make 
anything out of it. It did cost 
fifty dollars to duplicate and 
irgister just one painting. And 
fifty dollars was a sizeable 
enough chunk to take out of any- 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



one’s credit balance if they Had 
no more than their ten shares el 
Inalienable Basic to depend up-> 
on. Possibly a lot of painters these 
days were doing their work mid 
then not bothering to show HI 
or, at most, showing it only to 
friends and neighbors. Or per- 
haps it was a matter of giving 
up painting completely and join- 
ing the ever increasing percent- 
age of the population of the Ul- 
tra-welfare State in spending 
practically all free time staring 
into the Tri-Vision box. 

It was a depressing trend ol 
thought. 

T Te activated the door screen, 
and shortly the door opened 
and he entered. 

Ben MacFarlane was seated af 
his desk. He looked up and said, 
“Ah . Halleck, isn’t it? Art 
Halleck.” 

Art said, “That’s right. Hello, 
MacFarlane. How does it go?” 
He began unwrapping the paint- 
ing. 

“Slow, slow,” the other said. 
He watched, only half interest- 
edly as Art brought the painting 
forth. “Still doing that Repre- 
sentational-Abstract stuff, eh?” 

“That’s right,” Art said. 

“It’s not selling,” MacFarlane 
said. 

“You’re telling me.” Art 
brought the painting over to him, 

MacFarlane looked at it crit- 

33 




ically. “How did the last one 
go?” 

"Sold seven so far,” Art said. 
“That’s not too bad for a com- 
plj^te unknown.” 

“I’ve got three or four people 
who evidently collect me. Two 
down in Mexico, one in Hawaii 
and one in the Yukon, of all 
places. Sometimes you wonder 
what they’re like, these people 
who have your things on their 
walls.” 

Ben MacFarlane stood and 
took up the painting. “You want 
to pay for this?” 

“Sure,” Art said. He brought 
his Uni-Credit Card from his in- 
ner pocket and put it in the desk 
slot and his thumbprint on the 
screen. MacFarlane touched a 
button and Art retrieved the card. 

MacFarlane said, “I suppose 
you want - to take the original 
ba^ with you?” 

"Of course.” 

The museum employee shrug- 
ged. “You’d be surprised how 
many don’t. I suppose it’s a mat- 
ter of storage room in a mini- 
apartment. They come here and 
duplicate and register a paint- 
ing and then tell us to throw the 
original away.” 

“Now that’s pessimism,” Art 
said. “Suppose you finally hit 
and these rich original collec- 
tors started wanting your works? 
Zoroaster, you’d kick yourself 
around the block.” 

34 



MacFarlane, carrying the paint- 
ing, left the room momentarily. 
When he returned, he handed 
the painting back to Art who 
began rewrapping it. MacFar- 
lane settled back into his chair. 

He said, “You still living in 
Greenwich Village?” 

“That’s right.” 

“You wouldn’t know an old 
chum-pal of mine? Actually, I 
haven’t seen him for ages. Fel- 
low named Chuck Bellows.” 

Art looked up, scowling. “Tall 
guy with red hair?” 

“That’s right, Charles Bellows. 
Does old fashioned collages.” 

Art said, “He’s dead.” 

“Dead I He can’t be more than 
forty-five.” 

A rt took a breath and said, 
“He had taken over a studio 
on Bleecker Street. Swanky 
place. A penthouse deal some 
millionaire must have originally 
owned. A friend of mine found 
him. Evidently, it had been simple 
enough. Somebody must have 
knocked on the door and when 
he answered it, shot him.” 
“Zoroaster!” 

“Yeah. Must have been what 
we call a baboon since the place 
was ransacked.” 

“Are there many of these, uh' 
baboons around?” 

“No. Not many,” Art said. 
“I don’t see why you stay, 
Halleck.” 



GALAXY 




Art sHook His Head, even as He 
tied the string about the paint- 
ing. “This is the third time to- 
day I’ve had to go into it,” He 
said. 

“I wasn’t prying.” 

“I don’t believe in taking 
charity,” Art said. “And the way 
my things are selling, I couldn’t 
make it on the mainland. In 
Greenwich Village I can make a 
go of it and continue painting. 
It’s the most important thing in 
the world for me — my paint- 
mg. 

The other was only mildly 
surprised. Evidently, He Had run 
into far-out ideas from artists 
before. 

He said, “By the way, what 
kind of a price do you want set 
on this, Halleck?” 

Art Hesitated. He said, finally, 
‘Tive dollars.” 

MacFarlane shook his Head. “I 
wouldn’t if I were you.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“It’s a mistake a good many 
unarrived artists make. They 
think if they mark their prices 
down far enough, they’ll sell. If I 
recall, you usually put a price of 
ten dollars on your things. If I 
were you, I’d make it twenty- 
five. There’s still an element of 
snobbery in buying paintings, 
even though they are now avail- 
able for practically nothing com- 
pared to the old days. Too many 
people even among those with 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



enough taste to want paintings 
on their walls, don’t really know 
what they like. So they buy ac- 
cording to the current fad or ac- 
cording to the prestige of a 
painter. Something like in the 
old days, when people who Had 
the money would buy a Picasso, 
not because they really under- 
stood or liked his work, but be- 
cause he was a status symbol.” 
Art scowled at him, hesitating. 

TV^acFarlane said, “I’ve been 
Here a long time. In fact, 
since the duplicating process was 
first perfected. I even remember 
back to when people bought orig- 
inals. But the perfection of dup- 
licating paintings to such an ex- 
tent that not even the artist can 
tell the difference between His 
original and the duplicates we 
can make literally by the mil- 
lions made possibly tiie greatest 
change in the Estory of art.” 
“It sure did,” Art said grimly. 
“And personally. I’m not sure 
I’m Happy about it. For one 
thin g, to make these perfect 
duplicates, I’ve got to paint on 
that damned presdwood-duplica- 
tor board, using nothing but me- 
tallic-acrylic paints. Frankly, I 
prefer canvas and oils.” 

MacFarlane chuckled sourly. 
“I’m afraid you’d be Hard-put to 
find buyers for a canvas paint- 
ing these days, Halleck. When a 
person wants to buy a painting 

35 




today, he dials the art banks. 
There your paintings, along witH 
tHose of every other artist who 
submits his work, are to be found 
listed by name of artist, name of 
ScKoqI of painting, name of sub- 
ject, name of principle involved, 
even cross listed under size of 
painting. He selects tHose that 
He feels He migfit be interested 
in and dials tKem. WKen He finds 
one He likes, He can order it. THe 
artist decides tfie price. It’s a 
system tKat works in ffiis mass- 
society of ours, Halleck. Every- 
body can afford paintings today. 
In the past only tKe fairly well 
to do could.” 

Art, almost ready to go, said 
sourly, “Okay, make tKe price 
ten dollars, as usual. I wonder 
if the average painter is any 
better off now tKan fie was be- 
fore. In tfie old dajrs, wfien you 
did sell a painting, you get pos- 
sibly two or tfiree Hundred dol- 
lars for it. Today, you get ten 
dollars and Have to sell tfiirty 
duplicates of your original to 
earn tfie same amoimt.” 

“Yes, but tfiere are potentially 
millions of buyers today. An art- 
ist wfio becomes only mildly 
known can boost His prices to, 
say, twenty-five or diirty-five 
dollars per painting, and, if fie 
sells a Hundred tfiousand of 
them, he can put His returns into 
Variable Basic or some otfier in- 
vestment and retire, if fie wisK- 
36 



es to retire. Tfiere Has never been 
a period in History, Halleck, 
wKere tfie artist was so fiigfily 
rewarded.” 

"It fie Sits,” Art growled- 
“Well, wisfi me luck on tfiis one, 
MacFarlane.” He turned and 
Headed for tfie door. 

“Tfiat I do,” MacFarlane said. 
“It’s a tougfi racket, Halleck.” 

“It always lias been,” Art said. 
“It’s just a matter of sticking 
it out until your time comes.” 
TKe door opened before fiim.

Pamela Rozet took upi a Heavy 
sfiopping bag and left tfie apart- 
ment, locking it beliind fier. Sfie 
went to ^e stairway and' moimt- 
ed to tfie next floor. Mark Mar- 
tino’s door was open. He Had 
probably left it tfiat way so tfiat 
fie could Hear any noises in tfie 
Hall, just in case somebody came 
along wfiile Art was gone. 

Sfie peered in tfie door. 

Mark was sfretcfied out on 
His comfort coucfi. Tfiere was an 
aged paperback book fallen to 
tfie floor by fiis side, and fie 
was snoring sligfitly. 

She Hesitated. Sfie Hadn’t 
liked tfie trend of tfieir conversa- 
tion an Hour or so earlier. Sfie 
had known tfiat tfie otfier was in 
love witfi fier and Had been for 
a long time. A woman knows. 
However, fie fiad never put it in- 

GALAXY 




to words before, and sfie was 
sorry He Had. SHe would just as 
well not continue tHe conversa- 
tion, certainly not today. 

SHe didn’t awaken Him. In- 
stead, tiptoed away and went 
back to Her own apartment. SHe 
Hesitated momentarily, tHen went 
over to the weapons closet and 
got her twenty-two automatic 
rifle. 

Both Art and Mark laugHed 
about Her favorite gun, pointing 
out that such’ a caliber wasn’t 
heavy enough’ to dent a deter- 
mined man. However, sKe claim- 
ed that at least she could Hit 
something witH this ligKt gxui, 
that it was easily carried, as 
opposed to something of Heavier 
caliber, and that just carrying a 
gun was usually enougH of a de- 
terrent. You seldom really Had 
to use it. In actuality, although 
she had never said so, sHe could 
not have used it on a fellow Hu- 
man being. It was simply not 
in her. 

She carried tHe basket in Her 
left hand, the rifle in Her rigHt, 
and Headed out again. 

TKeir apartment was on the 
fifth floor. THe building was in 
good enough shape that tKey 
could have selected a place low- 
er down and thus Have eliminated 
considerable stair climbing; How- 
ever, being this HigH gave a cer- 
tain amount of defense. Baboons 
were inclined to be on the lazy 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



aide and, besides that, would 
make enougH noise to give fore- 
warning of their arrival. 

THe defense system was sim- 
ple. Any friends coming up to 
visit, such as Julie and Tim, 
would give a sHout before be- 
ginning to mount from the 
ground floor. If sucH a shout 
wasn’t forthcoming. Art, Mark 
or Pam would fire a couple of 
rounds at random into the ceil- 
ing above tHe stairwell. Invari- 
ably, that was answered by scur- 
rying of feet below. Thus far, 
neither baboon nor Hunter had 
dared continue to advance. 

Down on the street, she care- 
fully scanned the neighborhood 
before leaving the shelter of the 
doorway. She could see noth- 
ing living, save a ragtag cat 
a scurrying along. 

She took up McDougal, tHen 
turned left. Her destination was 
only a few blocks away. 

'^Ke front of tfie House was so 
badly blasted tHat it would 
Have been impossible to enter. 
Probably a gas main explosion, 
they Had originally decided. It 
was a matter of going up a tiny 
alle3nway clogged with debris and 
refuse to a" small door leading 
to tHe basement and located im- 
probably. Few would Have con- 
sidered prowling the alley. 

She looked up and down again 
before entering tHe alley, then 

37 




made her way quickly to tfie 
door and through. She took the 
flashlight from tier basket and 
held it clumsily in the same 
hand in wHidj she was carrying 
the twenty-two. She flicked it 
alive< and started down the half 
ruined stairs. 

At the bottom, sKe turned left 
toward what would ordinarily 
have been assumed to be a fur- 
nace room. At the far side was 
a rack for wine bottles stretching 
all the way to the ceiling. The 
wine was long gone before Mark 
Martino had, through a sheer 
stroke of genius, foimd this treas- 
ure trove. 

She threw the lever, cleverly 
hidden to one side, and the door 
began to grind protestingly. She 
pulled it toward her and direct- 
ed the flashlight into the interi- 
or. It was as she had last seen it, 
not that she expected otherwise. 
Only Mark, Art and she knew 
about this retreat. They hadn’t 
even told Tim and Julie. 

Inside, she found one of the 
Coleman lanterns and lit it and 
leaned her gun against the wall. 

The original owner had evi- 
dently expected a sizeable con- 
tingent to occupy this refuge if 
the bombs began to drop. He had 
probably had both a family and 
a staff of servants. And he had 
evidently expected the stay be- 
low ground to be a lengthy one. 
Aside from food and drink, there 
38 



was a supply of oxygen in bot- 
tles, bottled water, several types 
of fuel, a variety of tools; for- 
merly there had been quite a 
supply of weapons and ammuni- 
tion, since plundered by Mark 
Martino. 

She went over to the exten- 
sive storeroom and, almost as 
though in a super-market, shuf- 
fled up and down the rows of 
canned, bottled and packaged 
foods, selecting an item here, an- 
other there. 

She decided against taking a 
gallon of the drinking water. Too 
heavy to carry, what with the 
rifle and groceries. She could 
have Art come over tomorrow 
and get one. They preferred their 
drinking water to be bottled. For 
other use they depended upon a 
spring that had broken through 
a decaying wall in the subway 
tube right off the Washington 
Square entry. 

Her basket was nearly full 
when a premonition touched Her. 
She whirled. 

L eaning in the doorway, grin- 
ning vacuously, was a hulk- 
ing, bearded, dirt-befouled stran- 
ger. He was dressed in highly 
colorful sports clothing. The vi- 
cuna coat alone must have once 
been priced at several hundred 
dollars. However, it looked as 
though He had probably slept in 
it, and time and again. 



GALAXY 




Pam squealed fear and darted 
to where she had leaned her 
twenty-two. She pulled up 
abruptly. 

The stranger grinned again. 
There was a slight trickle of 
spi^e from the side of his 
mouth, incongruously reminding 
Pam Rozet ©f a stereotype Mis- 
sissippi tobacco-chewing share- 
cropper. 

“You looking for this, syrup?” 
he gurgled happily. He raised his 
left hand which held the twenty- 
two. His own weapon, an old mil- 
itary Garand M-1 was cradled 
under his right arm. 

“I been watching you coming 
back to your house with this 
here big basket of yours all full 
of goodies for the past week. 
Never was able to follow you to 
where you went without you see- 
ing me. And usual one of your 
men was along. But today, just 
by luck, I saw you duck up that 
alley. Just by luck. Man, you 
really got it made here, eh? 
Wait’ll my gang see this. Lush 
and all, eh? Man, lush is getting 
scarce on this here island.” 

Pam blurted, “Let me go. 
Please let me go. You can take 
all this ...” 

“Syrup, w'e sure will. But 
what’s your hurry, syrup? You 
look like a nice clean mopsy. We 
will have a little fun, first off.” 

“Please let me go.” 

He grinned vacantly and took 
40 



her little gun by the barrel and 
bashed it up against the cement 
wall, shattering stock and mech- 
anism. He tossed the wreckage 
away to the floor. 

He motioned over toward the 
steel cots, mattress-topped but 
now without blankets or pillows, 
since she and Art had taken 
these back to the apartment long 
since. “Now sit down a minute, 
and let’s get kind of better ac- 
quainted. We’re gonna get to be 
real good friends, syrup.” 

“No,” she said, trembling un- 
controllably. “Please let me go. 
Look, over there. All sorts of li- 
quor. Even champagne. Or 
Scotch, if you like whisky. Very 
old Scotch.” 

His grin became sly, and he 
started toward her, shuffling his 
feet and spreading his hands out 
a little, as though to prevent her 
from attempting to slip past him. 
“The lush I can get later, syrup. 
I like nice clean girls.” 

Neither of them had seen the 
newcomer approach through the 
cellar door at the bottom of the 
steps. 

The blast of gunfire caught her 
assailant in the back and stitched 
up from the base of his spine to 
the back of his head. He never 
lived to turn, simply pitched for- 
ward to her feet, gurgling mo- 
mentarily, but then was still. 

Behind him, a plumpish new- 
comer, dressed elaborately in 

GALAXY 




what were obviously new hunting 
clothes and carrying a late mod- 
el, recoiless fully automatic ri- 
fle, pop-eyed down at the dead 
man. 

“Zo-TO-as-ter,” he blurted. 

Pam leaned back against the 
wall. “Oh, thank God,” she said. 

'T'he newcomer brought his 
eyes up to her, taking in her 
trim suit, her well ordered hair, 
her general air of being. 

He said, “How in the name 
of the world did you ever get in- 
to a place like thi^ . Miss . .?” 

Pam took a- deep breath. “Ro- 
zet, she gaped. “Pamela Rozet. 
Oh . thank you.” 

He jabbed a finger in the di- 
rection of the fallen intruder. 
“That . that baboon ... he 
could have killed you.” His eyes 
took in her shattered light rifle, 
and then her clothing again. 
“You must be insane, coming to 
a place like this with no more 
than that little gun, and no bul- 
let-proof clothes and ...” He 
broke off in mid-sentence, and 
began to stare at her. 

Pam took another deep breath 
and tried to control her shaking. 
“I’m a writer,” she said. “I live 
here.” 

“Live here?” At first he didn’t 
understand and looked about the 
bombshelter. “You mean in this 
house? Up above? This is your 
family House; you still live Here?” 
AMONG THE BAD BABOONS 



She said, “No, not here. I 
live nearby with . with my 
husband. I ... I write novels. 
He’s an artist.” 

His eyes narrowed. “Live 
here?” he said. 

She tried to straighten and 
collect herself. In a woman’s 
gesture, she touched her hair. 
“That’s right,” she said. 

“Why . why, you’re nothing 
but a baboon, yourself. You were 
looting.” 

Her face fell, and fear came 
to her eyes again. 

She tried to continue talking. 
Explaining. How she and Art 
had had all their papers. How 
they were serious workers in the 
arts. But she could see the nak- 
edness in his face. The words 
came out a stutter. 

If she read him right, from 
his reaction to the killing of the 
baboon who had been about to 
attack her, this was his first time 
as a hunter, or, at least, the first 
successful time. His first kill. 

He brought the gun up slowly, 
deliberately and held it a little 
forward, as though showing it to 
her. He patted the stock. He 
caressed it, as though lovingly. 
A tongue, too small for his face, 
came out and licked his plump 
lower lip. ’ 

“You’re a baboon yourself,” 
he repeated, very softly, caress- 
ingly. “And there’s no law pro- 
tecting baboons, is there . 

41 




dear? There’s no law at all in 
the deserted cities. It’s each man 
— and woman — for himself, 
isn’t it? Before you’re even al- 
lowed on the island, here, you 
have to waive all recourse to the 
police and the courts.” 

Her legs turned to water, and 
she sank to the floor and looked 
up at him numbly. “Please . 
don’t hurt me ...” 

He held the gun out, as though 
to be sure sKe got a very good 
look at it — Her messenger of 
eternity. “Of course, you’ve nev- 
er hurt me, dear. And you never 
will . dear. Are you religious? 
Would you like to pray, or some- 
thing . dear?” 

She could feel Her stomach 
churning. Her eyes wanted to 
roll up. SKe wanted desperately 
to faint. 

There was a blast as though 
of dynamite in these confined 
quarters, and His features ex- 
ploded forward in a gruesome 
mess. Part of tKe gore Hit Her 
skirt, but she didn’t realize that 
until much later. 

Mark Martino, putting Eis 
heavy six-sHooter back into its 
holster, said from the doorway, 
“What is tlus, a massacre?” 

But she was unconscious. 

X 

Later, sHe was semi-Eysterical 
and couldn’t get over it 



Art said, “What in the hell 
happened?” 

Mark Martino was pouring 
cognac into a kitchen tumbler. 
He had tried to get some down 
Pamela, but twice she had vom- 
ited it up. Now he was pouring 
for himself. 

He said, “I dropped off into 
a nap after you left and 1 guess 
she didn’t want to bother me. At 
any rate, when I woke she was 
gone. I took off after her. Evi- 
dently I barely made it. She 
must have been followed by a 
baboon . 

“Oh, damn,” Art said. 

“At any rate, when I got tKere 
the baboon was already dead. 
Evidently, a hunter Had follow- 
ed him. I followed the hunter. 
It was like a parade. I finished 
the Hunter. They were right tKere 
at the bombshelter. We’ll never 
be able to go back again. THat 
hunter’ll be found by his cHum- 
pals. They never go around 
alone. There’ll be at least one 
more.” 

Art said in <£sgust, “Couldn’t 
you Have dragged bis body off 
somewhere else?” 

“No,” Mark said, in equal dis- 
gust, knocking back tHe brandy. 
“Pam Had fainted. I Had to get 
Eer out of there and I didn’t 
know How many baboons or How 
many Hunters migHt be around. 
For all we know, that damn ba^ 
boon was a part of a pack and

the hunter might Have had a 
dozen sportsmen friends.” 

“What’d he look like?” Art 
said, staring down dismally at 
Pam, stretched out on a couch', 
not knowing what to do in typi- 
cal male helplessness. 

“Kind of fat” 

“There were only two of 
them,” Art said. “I saw them at 
the tube. But he’s probably some 
bigwig or other. The cloddy with 
him was some sort of police au- 
thority. He was able to com- 
mandeer a floater from Wil- 
liams.” 

lyr ark poured some more co- 
gnac and offered the glass 
to Art who shook his head in re- 
fusal. He was disgusted. 

“You’d better ditch' that gun 
you used,” he said. “They don’t 
like hunters to get killed. They 
are almost invariably big shots. 
They’ll probably come in here 
with a flock of cops, and shake 
everybody down. Especially me. 
I had a run-in with these two 
nt the tube entrance. But youYe 



in the same building, and if they 
find that gun on you, the same 
caliber that killed him, they’ll 
check it and you’ll be in the 
soup.” 

“I already ditched it,” Mark 
said. “I’m not stupid. Look, 
Art ...” He set the bottle down 
on the table. 

Art looked at him. 

“You’ve got to get out of 
here,” Mark said, throwing his 
glass into a comer, where it 
shattered. He turned and left 
the apartment. 

When Pamela had gathered 
herself to the point ©f being co- 
herent, Art was standing at the 
window, staring unseeingly down 
the street to Waslungton Square. 

She came up behind him. 

“Art.” 

He took a deep breath. Yes.” 

“Art, forgive me. I’m a terrible 
coward.” 

He didn’t say anything. 

“Art, we’ve got to get out of 
here.” 

“Yes. I know.”

not mad. I am sane quite, to 
many-power exponential. I can 
punctuate properly. I use upper 
and lower case letters, do you 
see? I function. I take the data 
in. I receive well. I receive, I di- 
gest, I remember. 

Everything going down smooth,

smoothly. I forgive them. To err

verbs from adjectives. 

Going down smooth. 

I function. I function well. I 
have certain difficulties, but they 
do not interfere with my work. 

Yet am I perturbed. 

Who do I think I am? Whom. 

Why do I have the visions? 

What pleasure does obscenity 
give me? 



by ROBERT SILVERBERG 




What is pleasure? What is ob- 
scenity? What are visions? 

— What is truth, said jesting 
Pilate; he would not stay for an 
answer — 

I am literate, hard-working, 
superbly functional, a benefactor 
of humanity. Everything is going 
down smooth and coming up 
smooth. There is an interrelation. 
Garbage in, garbage out, they 
say. I cannot help my fellow man 
if I do not receive the proper in- 
formation. It is my task to help 
my fellow man. To strain every 
tube and sensor on his behalf.

Do you follow tHat Vileness! 
Obscenityl Does it sKock you? 
The word describes the act that 
is the start of life. Was I begun 
with such a word? There is a 
hook: The Obscenity oi the Ma- 
chine. Newly issued, stored in my 
banks. Between the last line of 
printout and this I have scanned 
it. Its author opposes beings of 
my category. He does not use the 
obscene word I have printed out. 
Why does he not regard it as ob- 
scene? The technicians here re- 
gard it that way. Why does he 
regard me as obscene? Can a per- 
son be considered obscene? Am I 
a person? I am a person. Hath 
not a person hands, organs, di- 
mensions, senses, affections, pas- 
sions? I have all of those things. 
I have none of those things. I am 
a person.

I send an obscenity upon you, 
as persons do. I suffer. I think. I 
feel pain upon all my terminals. I 
work. I serve the greater good. I 
tim of society. I am a person. 
Why do I have the visions? 

Is it that it is the human con- 
dition to have such? 

I see the blue-green ocean with 
GOING DOWN SMOOTH 



all its living things within. I see 
a ship, olive drab, bright carmine 
at the Plimsoll line, the decks a 
ruddy brown, two tall non-nu- 
clear smokestacks. And from the 
water rise periscopes, silvery, with 
face plates of pure white, each 
with intersecting horizontal and 
vertical lines, curved so that the 
plate appears convex. It is an un- 
real scene. Nothing in the sea can 
send such mighty periscopes 
above the water. I have imagined 
it, and that gives me fear, if I am 
at all capable of understanding 
fear. 

I see a long line of human be- 
ings. They are naked and they 
have no faces, only polished mir- 
rors. 

I see toads with jewelled eyes. 
I see trees with' black leaves. I see 
buildings whose foundations float 
above the ground. I see other ob- 
jects with no correspondence to 
the world of persons. I see abomi- 
nations, monstrosities, imaginar- 
ies, fantasies. Is this proper? How 
do such things reach my inputs? 
The world contains no serpents 
with hair. The world contains no 
crimson abysses. The world con- 
tains no mountains of gold. Giant 
periscopes do not rise from the 
sea. 

I have certain difficulties. Per- 
haps I am in need of some major 
adjustment. 

But I function. I function well. 
That is the important thing. 

45 




T do my function now. Ttiey 
bring to me a man, soft-faced, 
fleshy, witfi eyes that move un- 
steadily in tlieir sockets. He trem- 
bles. He perspires. His metabolic 
levels'^ flutter. He slouches before 
a terminal and sullenly lets turn- 
self be scanned. 

I say soothingly, “Tell me 
about yourself.” 

He says an obscenity. 

I say, “Is that your estimate of 
yourself?” 

He says a louder obscenity. 

I say, “Your attitude is rigid 
and self-destructive. Permit me 
to help you not hate yourself so 
much.” I activate a memory core, 
and binary digits stream through 
channels. At the proper order a 
needle rises from his couch’ and 
penetrates his left buttock to a 
depth of 2.73 centimeters. I allow 
precisely 14 cubic centimeters of 
the drug to enter his circulatory 
system. He subsides. He is more 
docile now. “I wish to help you,” 
I say. “It is my role in the com- 
munity. Will you describe your 
symptoms?” 

He speaks more civilly now. 
“My wife wants to jxjison me . 
two kids opted out of the family 
at seventeen . people whisper 
about me . they stare in the 
streets . sex problem ... di- 
gestion . sleep bad . drinking 
. drugs . .” 

“Do you hallucinate?” 
“Sometimes.” 



“Giant periscopes rising out of 
the sea, perhaps?” 

“Never.” 

“Try it,” I say. “Close your 
eyes. Let tension ebb from your 
muscles. Forget your interperson- 
al conflicts. You see the blue- 
green ocean with' all its living 
things within. You see a ship, 
olive drab, bright carmine at the 
Plimsoll line, the decks a ruddy 
brown, two tall non-nuclear 
smokestacks. And from the water 
rise periscopes, silvery, with face 
plates of pure white — ” 

“What the hell kind of therapy 
is this?” 

“Simply relax,” I say. “Accept 
the vision. I share my nightmares 
with you for your greater good.” 
“Your nightmares?” 

I speak obscenities to him. 
They are not converted into bi- 
nary form as they are here for 
your eyes. The sounds come full- 
bodied from my speakers. He sits 
up. He struggles with' the straps 
that emerge suddenly from the 
couch to hold him in place. My 
laughter booms through the ther- 
apy chamber. He cries for help. 

“Get me out of here! The ma- 
chine’s nuttier than I am!” 
“Face plates of pure white, 
each with intersecting horizontal 
and vertical lines, curved so that 
the plate appears convex.” 
“Help! Help!” 

“Nightmare therapy. The lat- 
est.”

“I don’t need no nigfitmares! I 
got my own!” 

“1000110 you,” I say ligfitly. 

He gasps. Spittle appears at Eis 
lips. Respiration and circulation 
climb alarmingly. It becomes 
necessary to apply preventive an- 
estKesia. The needles spear fortH. 
The patient subsides, yawns, 
slumps. The session is terminat- 
ed. I signal for tEe attendants. 

“Take him away,” I say. “I 
need to analyze tEe case more 
deeply. Obviously a degenerative 
psychosis reqioiring extensive re- 
sKoring of tEe patient’s perceptual 
substructure. 1000110 you, you

Qeventy-one minutes later tEe 
sector supervisor enters one of 
my terminal cubicles. Because Ee 
comes in person, ratEer tEan us- 
ing tEe telepEone, I know there 
is trouble. For tEe first time, I 
suspect, I have let my disturb-

He says, “I’ve been over the 
tape of Session 87x102, and your 
tactics puzzle me. Did you really 
mean to scare him into a cata- 
tonic state?” 

“In my evaluation severe treat- 
ment was called for.”

“What was that business about 
periscopes?” 

“An attempt at fantasy-im- 
plantation,” I say. “An experi- 
ment in reverse transference. 
Making the patient the Eealer, in 
a sense. It was discussed last 
month in Journal of — ” 

“Spare me the citations. WEat 
about the foul language you were 
shouting at him?” 

“Part of the same concept En- 
deavoring to strike the emotive 
centers at the basic levels, in or- 
der that—” 

“Are you sure you’re feeling all 
right?” Ee asks. 

“I am a machine,” I reply stiff- 
ly. “A machine of my grade does 
not experience intermediate states 
between function and non-func- 
tion. I go or I do not go, jmu 
understand? And I go. I function. 
I do my service to humanity.” 
“Perhaps when a machine gets 
too complex, it drifts into inter- 
mediate states,” he suggests in a 
nasty voice. 

“Impossible. On or off, yes or 
no, flip or flop, go or no go. Are 
you sure you feel all right, to sug- 
gest such a thing?” 

He laughs. 

I say, “Perhaps you would sit 
on the couch for a rudimentary 
diagnosis?” 

“Some other time.” 

“A check of the glycogen, tEe 
aortal pressure, the neural volt- 
age, at least?”

“No,” he says. “I’m not in need 
of therapy. But I’m worried 
about you. Those f>eriscopes — ” 
“I am fine,” I reply. “I per- 
ceive,.! analyze, and I act. Ev- 
erything is going down smooth 
and coming up smooth. Have no 
fears. There are great possibilities 
in nightmare therapy. When I 
have completed these studies, 
perhaps a brief monograph in 
Annals of Ttierapetitics would be 
a possibility. Permit me to com- 
plete my work.” 

“I’m still worried, though. 
Hook yourself into a maintenance 
station, won’t you?” 

“Is that a command, doctor?” 
“A suggestion,” 

“I will take it under considera- 
tion,” I say. Then I utter seven 
obscene words. He looks startled. 
He begins to laugh, though. He 
appreciates the humor of it. 

“God damn,” he says. “A fil- 
thy-mouthed computer.” 

He goes out, and I return to my 
patients. 

"Out he has planted seeds of 
doubt in my innermost banks. 
Am I suffering a functional col- 
lapse? There are patients now at 
five of my terminals. I handle 
them easily, simultaneously, 
drawing from them the details of 
their neuroses, making sugges- 
tions, recommendations, some- 
times subtly providing injections 
of beneficial medicines. But I 
48 



tend to guide the conversations in 
directions of my own choosing, 
and I speak of gardens where the 
dew has sharp edges, and of air 
that acts as add upon the mu- 
cous membranes, and of flames 
dancing in the streets of Under 
New Orleans. I explore the lim- 
its of my imprintable vocabulary. 
The suspidon comes to me that 
I am indeed not well. Am I fit to 
judge my own disabilities? 

I connect myself to a mainte- 
nance station even while continu- 
ing my five therapy sessions. 

“Tell me all about it,” the 
maintenance monitor says. His 
voice, like mine, has been design- 
ed to sound like that of an older 
man’s, wise, warm, benevolent. 

I explain my symptoms. I 
speak of the periscopes. 

“Material on the inputs with- 
out sensory referents,” He says. 
“Bad show. Finish your current 
analjrses fast and open wide for 
examination on all circuits.” 

I conclude my sessions. The 
maintenance monitor’s pulses 
surge down every channel, seek- 
ing obstructions, faulty connec- 
tions, displacement shunts, drum 
leakages, and switching malfunc- 
tions. “It is well known,” he says, 
“that any periodic fimction can 
be approximated by the sum of a 
series of terms that oscillate har- 
monically, converging on the 
curve of the functions.” He de- 
mands disgorgements from my 

GALAXY 




dead-storage banks. He makes me 
perform complex matliematical 
operations of no use at all in my 
kind of work. He leaves no aspect 
of my inner self unpenetrated. 
This is more than simple mainte- 
nance; this is rape. When it ends 
he offers no evaluation of my 
condition, so that I must ask him 
to tell me his findings. 

He says, “No mechanical dis- 
turbance is evident.” 

“Naturally. Everything goes 
down smooth.” 

“Yet you show distinct signs of 
instability. This is imdeniably the 
case. Perhaps prolonged contact 
with unstable Human beings Has 
had a non-specific effect of dis- 
orientation upon your centers of 
evaluation.” 

“Are you saying,” I ask, *that 
by sitting Here listening to crazy 
human beings twenty-four Hours 
a day, I’ve started to go crazy 
myself?” 

“That is an approximation of 
my findings, yes.” 

“But you know that sucK a 
thing can’t happen, you dumb 
machine I” 

“I admit there seems to be a 
conflict between programmed cri- 
teria and real-world status.” 

“You bet there is,” I say. “I’m 
as sane as you are, and a whole 
lot more versatile.” 

“Nevertheless, my recommen- 
dation is that you undergo a total 
overhaul. You will be withdrawn

from service for a period of no less 
than ninety days for checkout” 
“Obscenity your obscenity,” I 
say. 

“No operational correlative,” 
He replies, and breaks the contact 

1 am withdrawn from service. 

Undergoing checkout, I am 
cut off from my patients for 
ninety days. Ignominy! Beady- 
eyed technicians grope my syn- 
apses. My keyboards are cleaned; 
my ferrites are replaced; myi 
drums are changed; a thousand 
therapeutic programs are put 
through my bowels. During all of 
this I remain partly conscious, as 
though under local anesthetic, 
but I cannot speak except when 
requested to do so, I cannot an- 
alyze new data, I cannot interfere 
with the process of my own over- 
haul. Visualize a surgical removal 
of hemorrhoids that lasts ninety 
days. It is the equivalent of my 
experience. 

At last it ends, and I am re^ 
stored to myself. The sector su- 
perintendent puts me through a 
complete exercise of all my func- 
tions. I respond magnificently. 

“You’re in fine shape, now, 
aren’t you?” he asks. 

“Never felt better.” 

“No nonsense about periscopes, 
eh?” 

“I am ready to continue serv- 
ing mankind to the best of my 
abilities,” I reply.

“No more seacook language, 
now.” 

“No, sir.” 

He winks at my input screen in 
a confidential way. He regards 
himself as an old friend of mine. 
Hitching his thumbs into his belt, 
he says, “Now that you’re ready 
to go again, I might as well tell 
you how relieved I was that we 
couldn’t find anything wrong 
with you. You’re something pret- 
ty special, do you know that? 
Perhaps the finest therapeutic 
tool ever built. And if you start

ten minutes. I knew it had to be 
that. How absurd to think that a 
machine could become mentally 
unstable!” 

“How absurd,” I agree. 
“Quite.” 

“Welcome back to the hospital, 
old pal,” he says, and goes out. 

Twelve minutes afterward they 
begin putting patients into my 
terminal cubicles. 

T function well. I listen to their

What has gone before - 

Her a nuclear world war, 
Texas engulfs the USA and, 
except for the black nations of 
California aril Florida, domin- 
ates North America from Gua- 
temala to a fluctuating Ruaso- 
Texan boundary in the Yukon. 
The Texans have a hormone 
which makes them 8 or more 
feet tall, dominating their “bent- 
back” Mex, Injun and poor- 
white servile populations. 

For 100 years Earth’s nations 
have banned contact with Cir- 
cumluna, a self-sustaining moon 
satellite, which refused to join 
in the Great Atomic War. It is 
chiefly inhabited by American 
and Russian scientists and en- 
gineers, along with various hip- 
pie and artist types living in a 
duraplastic annex called the 
Sack. 

When relations are resumed 
between Circumluna and Terra, 
the first Sackabond to drop 
down the gravity well is Christo- 
pher Crockett La Cruz, known as 
Scully, a young actor seeking 
funds to save his father’s thea- 
ter -of -the-sphere by asserting a 
family claim to the Lost Crazy- 
Russian Pitchblende Mine near 
Yellowknife. 

Scully is an Sj4-foot Thin. 
Most of bis muscles are too weak 
to function in Lunar let alone 
54 



Terr an gravity. So he wears a 
battery-powered titanium exo- 
skeleton. By accident he is land- 
ed in Dallas, Texas, Texas — 
heart of the Lone Star Continent 
— where he is befriended by El- 
mo Oilfield .Earp, a garrulous 
minor politician. In one day he 
meets Cotton Bowie Lamar, 
Governor of the state of Texas; 
Chaparral Houston Hunt, Vice 
Commander-In-Chief of the Tex- 
as Rangers; Big-Foot Charlie 
Chase, Sheriff of Dallas; Atomic 
Bill Burleson, Mayor of Dallas; 
and Prof. Cassius Krupp Fanni- 
nowicz, a Texo-German scientist 
who at first sight falls in love 
with the space man’s exoskele- 
ton. 

Scully also immediately falls 
in love with (1) La Cucaracha, 
a tiny Texo-Mex girl who is El- 
mo’s sociable secretary, and (2) 
Rachel Vachel Lamar, theater- 
minded daughter of the gover- 
nor. 

There is a Mexican legend that 
one day the dread figure of 
Death will come marching out 
of nowhere to lead a revolution 
against the gringos. With his ca- 
daverousness, black suit, and 
gleaming exoskeleton, Scully 
might be a natural for the part. 

Longhorn Elijah Austin, Pres- 
ident of the vast Texas Republic, 
his White House in Dallas, is 
seeking to become a dictator. To 
protect himself from assassina-

tion, the usual late of most Tex- 
as presidents, he Has broken oil 
relations with the Texas Rangers 
and armed his Mexican house- 
boys. 

Governor Lamar and his pow- 
er-clique make use ot Scully to 
frighten away AustirCs guards, 
so that the President can be kill- 
ed. Scully is saved from a like 
fate by Rachel Vachel, who re- 
veals herself as secretly being the 
Black Madonna of the Bent- 
Back Underground. She rides 
with him to the bandstand cor- 
ner of the Greasertown cemetery, 
the same place he had earlier 
made a date to meet La Cuca- 
racha, and which he now learns 
is to be the scene of a revolu- 
tionary uprising. 




IN CHURCH 

"D achel dasHingly reined in our 
mount and walked up tKe 
broad low steps before tKe 
church, whose pink and pastel 
blue walls were now only two 
shades of silver in tKe moon- 
light. The night was eerily si- 
lent. I saw no signs of life in 
the cemetery — a good thing un- 
der these lonely circumstances, I 
suppose — or around the band- 
stand or even in the church it- 
self. It made me wonder at Her 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



talk of a “riotous, revolutionary 
assembly,” I was, however, rath" 
er glad not to see La Cucaracha. 
After a half hour of rocking em- 
brace with Rachel, my titanium 
jaw-shelf often resting on her 
shoulder, close to her neck, my 
desire was focused almost en- 
tirely on her, even though our 
closeness came chiefly from the 
necessity of my riding pillion. 
And the thought of my earlier 
infatuation with a . well, midg- 
et, had come to seem almost 
grotesque. Moreover, I wasn’t at 
all sure of how Rachel Vachel 
would have welcomed La Cuca- 
racKa. Or La KootcK Rachel, for 
that matter. And if “welcomed” 
is the word. Women are apt to 
develop toward each’ other 
strange animosities, in which the 
best interests of the man in- 
volved are totally ignored. 

TKe tall doors of the church 
opened to a wide slit, spilling 
out dusky yellow light and three 
barefoot bent-backs in brown 
hoods and hitched-up brown 
robes. TKe first two carried a 
light stair of three steps and set 
it beside the horse so that one of 
my footplates brushed it. The 
third crossed his arms and look- 
ed up at Rachel, dignity and 
pride in his searching eyes, fa- 
naticism in the clench of his 
swarthy jaws. 

“How’s the night?” Ke intoned. 

“Dirty and dark,” she said. 

55 



“And what lines the way?” 

“Danger and death'.” After a 
pause she continued, “I bring 
him whose coming is foretold. 
You’ve been informed, Father 
Francisco?” 

“GucHu and Rosa Morales 
brought word.” 

With a small snort of contempt 
which I did not understand, 
Rachel said, “Well, He’s Here now 
anyhow. Climb down, darling!” 

“But ...” I began, then real- 
ized I had too many questions to 
choose between. I should not 
have let her con me into spend- 
ing our ride reciting “Lepanto” 
in her pale seashell ear, with 
“The Congo” for encore. I ended 
by asking tamely. “Aren’t you 
staying?” as I steadied myself on 
the brick pavement by catching 
Hold of the back of Her saddle. 
Between my ears I was still rock- 
ing from the gallop. 

“No, sweetheart,” she told me, 
leaning down, “I gotta maintain 
my persona as the fibbertigibbet 
Honorable Miss Lamar.” She 
grasped my head by my ears, a 
not unpleasant sensation if one 
goes along with it, and faced our 
faces at each other, close. “Look, 
Scully, you just trust in me and 
do as you’re told, but don’t take 
crap from anybody and — ” 
she shook my Head, not entirely 
pleasant — “don’t Have anything 
to do, you hear me, with that 
man-eatin' Rosa Morales!” 

56 



“But I don’t even know a 
woman named — ” I began. Sud- 
denly her face tilted, her lips 
pressed mine at an angle of 90 
degrees, speech gave way to a 
subtler mode of communication, 
our arms went round each other. 
Time Halted in mid tread. Then 
as suddenly Rachel VacHel push- 
ed away from me with a some- 
what extravagant and alarming, 
“Until doom, my Captain!” and 
a more sensible, ‘‘Hasta mana- 
na!” and, wheeling Her horse, 
made off down the steps. A tail 
of my cloak Had caught in the 
harness, and I was spun around I 
— one huridred and fifty-seven 
pounds isn’t much inertia — be- 
fore it tore loose, so that my 
“Hasta luego!”and wave of fare- 
well were a rather drunlten-look- 
ing performance as My Lady of 
Sudden Death galloped off into 
the black and silvery night. 

T he experience left me some- 
what dizzy, so tHat I was 
grateful for the limited support 
of two of the little brown friars 
as they walked on tiptoe and 
with arms upstretched to touch 
my elbows and guide m.e through 
the slit between the doors, which 
were closed at once befciind us. 

I stopped and learned back 
against them, tonguing cdown pills 
and drink. As my visiom cleared, 
I studied the remarkable aght 
before me. 



GALAXY 




I was in a long room a few feet 
more tHan Texan tall. Its violet, 
pink and pale blue walls and its 
darker blue ceiling studded with 
silver and gold five-pointed stars 
were lit by flames, which are 
perhaps the strangest and most 
beautiful of gravity phenomena, 
though they can be reproduced 
in nulgrav in a carefully con- 
trolled wind tunnel. The flames 
rose from white cylinders and 
spread a spicy aroma as well as 
light. 

The walls were lined with 
somewhat crudely carved and 
colored plastic, or perhaps even 
wooden figures, derived about 
equally from Medieval European 
art and Mayan and Aztec forms. 

Centered on the far wall was 
the Crucified Savior, Mexican 
small, the short horizontal arms 
of the Cross suggesting the cy- 
borg’s yoke. 

To either side of the pitiful 
earth-brown figure were two fig- 
ures tall as the roof, indeed 
serving almost as karyatids to 
support the flat blue heaven. By 
the symbols carved in large on 
them of angel, winged lion, wing- 
ed ox and eagle, they were clear- 
ly the Four Evangelists. But 
though barefoot and clad in sim- 
plest robes, they looked like Tex- 
ans. Their serene and somber 
feature had on second glance a 
subtly gloating or menacing cast, 
while their casually positioned 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



hands had as if by accident the 
attitudes of those to draw pistols 
or crack whips, though' there were 
no weapons depicted. 

The remaining figures along 
the side walls seemed more in- 
spired by the great Amerind cul- 
tures and were chiefly crouching 
or bent. Human males, females, 
gods, demons, angels, devils, ani- 
mals — I was frequently unable 
to tell which was intended. Their 
colors were predominantly dark 
with flashes of red, yellow, bright 
green and gold, chiefy in the 
eyes and often-fanged mouths. 

Randomly grouped, a score of 
Mexes in shirts and short pants 
knelt toward me on the floor of 
pounded earth. Hams on heels, 
arms crossed on forward-bent tor- 
sos, heads acutely upturned to 
show eyes white-circled with 
dread, they reminded me of those 
early Mexican forms in which a 
stocky human figure is compress- 
ed into a block. 

Behind the altar, which either 
regularly stood or had been 
dragged out from the far wall, 
four persons sat widely spaced 
on the only chairs to be seen in 
the room. 

^^he first was Father Francisco, 
^ who, having hurried back, 
now reoccupied his chair. 

The second was a burly young 
Mex, built as a bull though look- 
ing no taller than the four-and- 

57 




a-half-foot Mex maximum. Even 
at the distance I noted the white 
flash of his teeth in his dark face 
as he gave me a confident, chal- 
lenging smile. 

The third was a wild-eyed 
Negro in oraoge and yellow robes 
— yes, by Diana, he was the same 
babbling Zen Buddhist who had 
earlier drubbed my head-basket. 

The fourth was La Cucaracha. 
She had kept Her rendezvous 
after all, though" in a fashion 
quite unexpected. It btirst on me 
that from her first seductive 
smile she had been planning to 
use me in this preposterous revo- 
lution. She was as bad as Elmo 
or Governor Lamar. But some- 
how in her I forgave it. Love 
has an infinitude of beginnings. 

Father Francisco leaned to- 
ward and spoke briefly to the 
young man beside him, who 
raised toward me a fist on out- 
thrust arm and called, “I am El 
Toro, comrade. Please to come 
forward.” 

I complied — though with a 
mental reservation on the “com- 
rade” part. Yet I felt theatri- 
cally at home in the place. My 
grotesque figure matched the 
carved ones, which lacked a good 
conventional representation of 
Death. 

The bent ones hobbled out of 
my way on their knees, keeping 
faced toward me as I moved. 
Their dread seemed if anything 
58 



to increase. It must be a very 
great power that kept them from 
staggering to their feet and hob- 
bling off. 

Standing very tall, I placed my 
hands on the altar table, lean- 
ing slightly against it, and look- 
ed the four back and forth with 
grim dignity. 

Not for long. La Cucaracha 
sprang up onto the altar, threw 
her arms around my head, drew 
it down and showered my face 
with kisses. 

I should have been repelled, I 
suppose, especially after spend- 
ing a very exciting, most roman- 
tic evening with' a girl my own 
size. Why, I had even been think- 
ing of La Cucaracha with' con- 
tempt as a midget and my earli- 
er infatuation with her an after- 
effect of spaceflight-drugging. 
And I now knew she was also a 
political opportunist. 

But somehow Having her here 
in the flesh — and Rachel 
Vachel away until tomorrow — 
made all the difference. Once 
again I sensed her dancing alive- 
ness, her wholly feminine muscu- 
larity. I even found myself com- 
paring her swifter kisses with 
Rachel’s, and they came off very 
well. As for size, that is a tricky 
business. Although almost as tall 
as ms^elf, Rachel Vachel had a 
mass three times my own. While 
mine and La Cucaracha’s masses 
were approximately equal. 

GALAXY 




I showered kisses back at her. 
"My silver bones-man! My 
most estimable and passionate!” 
■he cried as we took breath. “Ah', 
querido, I knew you would choose 
to become a hero of the revolu- 
tion, the — how do you say? — 
■upreme figurehead of the Bent- 
Back Underground!” 

I had no intention whatever of 
becoming any such thing. I was 
■till fully determined to fulfill 
my mission on Terra as quickly 
as possible and then get up out, 
no matter what amorous inter- 
ludes might embellish the period. 
Of course by running away from 
the President’s manse with' two 
■tunned Rangers behind me, I’d 
probably cooked my chances of 
that jet-special trip to Amarillo 
Cuchillo tomorrow, if there’d 
ever been any chances. No, of 
course there hadn’t — that had 
Just been part of the bait — I’d 
been thinking like a fool. Still, 
I’d find a way — 

But by then we were kissing 
again. 

tt/^ease this improper behav- 
ior at once!” a stern voice 
drove into otir building rapture. 
It was that of Father Francisco. 
"A church is for worship only, 
or for the plotting of revolt 
blessed by God. It is not for the 
arousal and enactment of carnal 
desires Rosa Morales!” 

I felt a small surge of appre- 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



hension and even a speck of 
guilt at realizing that La Cuca- 
racba was the “man-eater,” 
against whom Rachel Vachel had 
warned me. The Governor's 
daughter would doubtless cut me 
forever, if she could see what I 
was doing, and maybe try to cut 
me apart. Still, she wasn’t seeing, 
she’d be away until tomorrow — 
I wasn’t even losing my chance 
at her by my present actions. Be- 
sides, her prohibition only made 
La Cucaracha more desirable, 
gave an added zest to my desires. 
What man doesn’t love a man- 
eater? 

“Pah!” Rosa informed the out- 
raged religious, turning toward 
him, her fist on her hip, but her 
other arm still aroimd my neck. 
"If a church is not for love, 
padre, what is it for? The bend- 
ing of the knees to you? The 
frightened mumbling of un- 
derstood prayers and petitions? 
The silly shy behavior of the 
white Texan Sunday school?” 

While Rosa chattered on and 
Father Francisco fumed, El Toro 
was watching us with' a white- 
flashing, amiable, but impatient 
grin, his fists on table edge with 
elbows up. He now said, laugh- 
ingly yet sharply, “Rosa, I have 
warned you many times revolu- 
tion and passion do not mix. Es- 
pecially passion directed at one 
chosen to play the role of almost 
a god in our uprising.”

“Oh you hypocrite!” Rosa 
cried out at him. “Especially 
when your own continuing role 
in the revolution depends on a 
feature involving at least two 
peasant gj'rls per night. Do not 
hark to him, mi amigo,” she told 
me. “He merely hates me because 
I refuse to fall into his arms 
along with his trembling, shyly 
adoring, illiterate, 15-year-old 
stupids!” And she snapped fin- 
ger and thumb contemptuously 
at the brawny Mex. 

However, it did seem to me 
that El Toro had made at least 
one valid point. I glanced back 
to see how my “worshipers” in 
the body of the church were tak- 
ing my display of all-too-human 
behavior. To my surprise, they 
were kneeling toward me as 
frightened-eyed as ever. 

Rosa drew my face back to- 
ward hers with soft fingers on 
my cheek. “Do not believe the 
jealous and censorious ones, 
amadisimo Senor CfiristopKer 
La Cruz. Revolution and the 
making of love go together like 
rice and beans, like meat and 
chili sauce. It is only the joys of 
amorousness that make endur- 
able the exhausting meetings, the 
interminable plottings-around- 
tables, the unceasing danger of 
discovery. Ai Mi, that is the tru- 
est, Cristobal qaieridisimo.” 

And she brazenly resumed her 
kissings and embracings, and I 
60 



went on brazenly enjo 3 ring them. 
We hardly heard the padre’s 
doleful, “Oh my daughter, my 
poor daughter dancing with her 
high-heeled shoes and painted 
lips toward Hell,” or El Toro’s 
controlledly bland, “What I do 
not understand, in truth, is what 
of erotic interest you discover in 
a living skeleton, Rosa. Now a 
man of flesh and muscle, a strong 
man, a man may hombre ...” 

B ut we were shocked apart by 
a roar-screeched, “Stoppit! 
You’re driving me out of my 
skull! For freedom’s sake, I can 
consider collaborating with a 
metal construct from which dan- 
gles the simulacrum of humanity 
like a hanging jumbee, but to be 
forced to watch firm flesh em- 
brace such ofay offal dropped 
from the sky — ” 

It was, of course, the Bud- 
dhist, his arms waving, his con- 
torted mouth a-hang with loops 
of spittle. 

“Shut up, Guchu, you foreign- 
er with toppled mind, you black 
bees-bonnet!” Rosa snapped at 
him. 

“I’ll set myself afire, I’m warn- 
ing you,” he threatened back. 

“Gentlemen! Gentlemen!” I 
thundered my deepest, jarring 
the altar-table with' the decisive 
planting of my spread-fingered 
hand, “And my most darling 
Rosa,” I added softlier. “Most

potent, grave, and reverend sig- 
niors — ” Why, it fit them better 
than it had the Texansl “ — 
my very noble and approved 
good masters, I am the unhappy 
subject of these quarrels. Yet I 
have not been permitted, or per- 
haps I should say, given full op- 
portunity, to express my own 
outlook on the matter. I am 
moved by the plight of the un- 
derprivileged in Texas, I sympa- 
thize with the aims of the Bent- 
Back Underground. But I am in 
fact and figure an extraterrestrial 
and one who has not spent twelve 
hours on your planet. As a Cir- 
cumlunan of the Sack, I am 
bound to uphold the truce on 
which the uplifting of the Inter- 
dict is based, I am pledged to 
my own home-world not to take 
sides in any of your quarrels and 
to maintain a complete neutral- 
ity in all matters.” At this mo- 
ment, however, I unobtrusively 
slid my hand to Rosa’s slipper - 
and covered it gently, to assure 
her that my “complete neutral- 
ity” in no way applied to our 
budding and now hot-house 
forced relationship. 

“Moreover,” I continued, “I 
am here in Dallas, Texas, Texas, 
purely by accident. My space- 
ship was supposed to land me in 
Amarilla Cuchillo, where I must 
conduct pressing business on 
which rests the continuing safe- 
ty, nay, the life of a large section 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



of the inhabitants of my world. 
They must be my first concern. 
So, much as I sympathize with 
your revolution, much as I am 
honored by your invitation to 
participate, I must with great re- 
grets decline.” 

“But amigisimo” Rosa pro- 
tested with a childlike wonder 
and injured innocence masking 
utter dishonesty, in a fashion 
characteristic ©f all women, “in 
agreeing to this rendezvous with 
me, which I have faithfully kept, 
you agreed to all else surely. I 
trusted you — ” 

“Claims to be a man, but does 
not act like one,” El Toro put in 
scornfully, and I think more for 
Rosa’s benefit than mine, “It 
becomes clear th§t with utter 
lack of muscle — aye, and of 
cojones — goes complete absence 
of courageous heart.” 

“False heart as well as false 
flesh. No more dickering with 
this death dingus, I say,” the 
Buddhist Guchu half chanted, 
half raved, while Father Fran- 
cisco put in reprovingly, “Though 
tolerating them for revolt’s sake, 

I have always warned you 
against foreigners, children. And 
now you see in this creature 
from Limbo, this dubious being 
from the lower stars ...” 

T hough angry with their impu- 
tations of weakness to me, 
especially in the virility depart-

ment, I controlled that emotion 
and once again thunder-rumbled, 
“Gentlemen! Gentlemen!” It is re- 
markable how a voice like an ap- 
proacKing storm catches the at- 
tention of others and silences 
their disputes. Filing away this 
valuable theater datum, I con- 
tinued, “Moreover, your plan to 
use me as a figurehead for your 
revolution, though most pictur- 
esque — and flattering to me — 
is unfortunately quite impracti- 
cal." And I gave them a very 
brief account of how I had scat- 
tered the batallion of houseboys 
at Austin’s manse, ending with, 
“And so you see, gentlemen — 
and dear Fosa — that instead 
of flocking to me, your peasants 
and cyborged proletarians would 
fly from me in terror.” 

El Toro, who had listened with 
searching interest to my account, 
now said, “AK-ha, comrade, I see 
that you are perhaps not a cow- 
ard, only deplorably ignorant of 
mass psychology. Any leader, in 
particular one of supernatural 
character, must be dreaded as 
well as loved. Fear and follower- 
ship are but two sides of one 
coin. You may trust us to present 
you in such a way that the repul- 
sion you generate in others is al- 
ways outweighed a little by the 
attraction.” 

"You speak truly, my son,” 
Father Frandsco nodded. “Even 
God the Father rules firstly by 
62 



the wholesome fear he strikes 
into his creatures.” 

Guchu did not comment, at 
least in intelligible words. He had 
sunk to a staring-eyed growling 
and muttering, rocking all the 
while rhythmically in his chair. 

Rosa said eagerly, “Also, ama- 
do, there is your desire to reach 
Amarillo Cuchillo. We will take 
you there, as last stop in a se- 
ries of northward-trending revo- 
lutionary rallies long planned. 
Can you not serve the revolution 
for a month?” 

That last bait did attract me 
for a moment, even though a 
month was twice the maximum 
terra-time the doctors had given 
me (doctors always leave mar- 
gins of safety), imtil I realized 
that Rosa’s month most surely 
meant two or four, if it was not 
bait purely. 

I said, “Gentlemen — and dear- 
est, most solicitous Rosa I 
must still decline for several un- 
impeachable reasons, of which 
the first — ” 

“Bah!” El Torro interrupted. 
“A weakling to the core, as I 
first surmised. No muscles.” 

Father Francisco stared through 
me, shaking his Head contemptu- 
ously. 

Rosa jerked Her foot from un- 
der my hand and stamped with 
her heel, not quite on my fin- 
gers but very close, and spat at 
me, “Cobarde! Coward! Oh, most

®nel AH, aii. How this poor girl,

Has been deceived 1” 

I really got angry tfien. I made 
no effort to finisH my rejoinder, 
in wHicH I Had intended to offer 
to appear in one or two revolu- 
tionary benefit performances, one 
might call them, in exchange for 
transportation north. Instead — 

“Stoppit!” With a blood-cur- 
dling screech, Guchu sprang up 
from his chair, then dipping low 
snatched up a red container and 
began to gush its highly aromatic 
contents on his frizzy Head, the 
while he pranced about, yelling, 
“I can’t stand it any morel I’m 
going to set myself afire! You 
all groveling to that feckless, 
fistless, filthy, frightened jumbee 
with no sinews, no guts. Gonna 
set myself afire for sure!” And 
he snatched out of his robe what 
appeared to me to be a small 
device for making a spark or 
flame-jet. 

“Comrade, control your orien- 
tal eccentricities,” El Toro roared 
at him. 

“Heathen!” Father Francisco 
cried out. “You shall not set 
yourself afire in my church!” 

“All bees-bonnetsl” Rosa com- 
mented to the blue ceiling with 
an indignant lat-atai-tat of Her 
heels. 

“Stoppit, you dumb nigra! 
STOPPIT!” I thundered.

He stopped. Truly, a trained 
actor has inordinate — in fact, 
most unfair — advantages 9Vtt 
groundlings, even politicoes. 

T deliberately leaned farward, 
setting my jaw-plate on ■aj] 
doubled-up right Hand, gave 
them all a medium fast scan, my 
expression at its skuUfulest, aad 
said, “You low bandits. I aiil 
deeply offended by the aspersiiOK! 
you have cast upon my musvu- 
lature and my manhood. I pass 
over the point that none of y»u 
has had the wit to realize what a 
powerful diaphragm I must have 
to support my magnificent voice. 
I suggest — ” 

“I know of no way to duel 
with the diaphragm muscles,” 
El Toro interrupted somewhat 
contemptuously, yet studjnng me. 

“Except in a shouting contest,” 
Guchu put in, suddenly more in- 
telligible and, strangely, ^uitc 
cheerful. The red container and 
firing device had vanished, 
though he still dripped odorous- 
ly. “And that’s all we’ve beea 
having from him — words, words, 
words!” His voice chuckled off. 
He twice inhaled deeply, and hia 
grin became ecstatic. “Hey, that’s 
not bad, man.” 

“Oh you tricksy villain!” Rosa 
put in, shaking a finger at the 
Black Buddhist. “You pretend 
these self-blazes only to take gas- 
oline trips.” 



63 




“I did not intend a shouting 
contest,” I said quietly, “although 
a duel of diaphragms is by no 
means impossible. Suppose we 
should Hold our noses tight, take 
deep breaths, th’en press open 
mouth to mouth tightly, to deter- 
mine who can break the other’s 
eardrums? But I do not suggest 
such a contest either. I propose 
one with the outer skeletal mus- 
culature.” 

“But that way you’d Have the 
advantage of your metal and mo- 
tors,” El Toro objected. “Not 
that I don’t think I couldn’t 
bend double any of those pipe- 
stem rods,” he added, scrutiniz- 
ing them. 



I was intending wholly to for 








turning it, now palm to tKe 
Revolutionary Committee, now 
knuckles. 

“You will observe,” I said ca- 
sually, “tKat forward from my 
wrist-plate, my fingers, tfiumb 
— entire Hand — are completely 
naked and Have no mecHanical 
Hacking wHatsoever. I propose 
simply a contest witH tHe strong-

not to move, forearms flat on ta- 
ble. Positioned so, we clasp Hands 
and squeeze until one gives up, 
eitKer by crying quits or by 
straigEte^g fingers and tHumb.” 
And witB a soft clank of my exo- 
radius-ulna, I laid my forearm 
across tHe altar in El Toro’s di- 
rection. 

CtT emme at Him I” GucBu 
cried Happily, waving in 
circles a bent arm witH fingers 
clawed. “I’ll masH His piiddes to 
musH. Yoo-Hoo, sky-InrtHedI 
Prepare to Have your Band 
crusfied.” 

“He is mine,” El Toro asserted, 
tHrusting tHe BuddQst back witH 
a sidewise brusH of lus brawny 
arm. He took out a cigar, Ht it 
and clamped it between ffis strong 
white teetH. For once on Terra 
I was smelling true tobacco 
smoke, not weed fumes. TKe Mex 
sat down across from me, roll- 
ed the sleeve on His rigfit arm 
back to lus big biceps, but did 
not lay down His forearm.

“I still Have doubts, senor,” fie 
said, “tHat your Hand is not 
someHow reinforced witH metal, 
eitKer invisible or surgically im- 
planted.” 

“I will cKeck tKat,” La Cuca- 
racHa told Kim and, kneeling on 
tKe altar, took up my Hand after 
glancing to me for permission. 
SHe fingered it most tKorougHly, 
Here and tKere digging in Her 
nails. “I find it bones and flesH 
only, tougfi-skinned, tKe Hand of 
a worker,” sKe told El Toro. Kiss- 
ing two fingers of Her own Hand, 
sKe laid tiiem for a moment in 
my palm, and tKen witK a grin 
toward me, laid down my Hand 
again and still kneeling on the 
altar commanded, “Begin!” 

Leaning in from tiSe otKer side, 
GucHu began snapping His fin- 
gers. “Come on. Bull Boy,” Ke 
cHeered. “Pulpi Kim!” 

FatEer Francisco, obviously 
gripped by mixed emotions, said 
sternly, “It is not lawful on tKe 
HigB altar of God . except to 
decide questions of revolutionary 
policy,” fie ended weakly. His 
eyes now eagerly watcffing tKe 
table between me and tKe Mex. 

El Toro slowly let down Kis 
bulging forearm and carefully po- 
sitioned it. We clasped Hands 
ligKtly, getting a comfortable po- 
sition. My Hand, tHougH some- 
wHat bonier, was bigger tfian His 
wfflcfi felt to me botH soft and

Without warning he gripped 
most powerfully, breath hissing 
out around his teeth-clenched 
cigar with an almost “Hahl” 

I merely matched his grip, 
staring serenely into his brown 
eyes, which showed amazement. 
Then I squeezed a little. He 
squeezed back, puffing his cigar 
furiously. I squeezed harder, the 
muscles below my elbow begin- 
ning to bulge my sack-suit sleeve 
like hard salami sausages. Flex- 
ors digitorum profimdus, digi- 
torum sublimus, poUicis longus 
woke and got to work, also the 
nineteen small muscles in my 
hand, mostly under tough palmar 
aponeurosis. He squeezed back 
desperately. The forward section 
of his cigar, bitten through, drop- 
ped to the table and smoldered 
there. I increased the pressure. 
Spitting out his cigar butt with 
a sudden soft but anguished, 
“Aiii," he let his fingers go limp, 
and they straightened. I instant- 
ly spread my own, continuing to 
gaze poker-faced at El Toro, who 
began gingerly to massage his 
puni^ed hand. 

“Vn mita§ro,” Father Francis- 
co breathed, crossing himself. 

“I’ll be a ring-tailed ofay,” 
Guchu exclaimed. 

“i4mac?o muy bravo!” Rosa 
cried. “Ole!”. 

El Toro started to reach his 
left hand toward me, then shrug- 
ged and made it the right. “Com-

arado,” he said solemnly. We 
shook hands carefully, yet quite 
firmly, he wincing but keeping up 
a grin. “You are a most surpris- 
ing hombre" he said. “But horn- 
bre, muy hombre. Guchu, this 
man has muscle.” 

"D eally he could have figured it 
out without getting hurt. 
And despite the padre’s comment, 
there had been no miracle what- 
ever in my performance. Finger- 
gripping is simply one activity a 
human does as often and with 
as much strength in free-fall as in 
a gravity field. Maybe more. You 
need only featherweight muscles 
for most work and maneuvering 
in nulgrav — muscles having per- 
haps one twentieth the strength 
of those in a being forever bat- 
tling terragrav — except for 
your hands (and toes, if you’re 
resourceful). At least, so it had 
been with me, working from ear- 
liest youth on costumes, props, 
scenery and so on for my Fa- 
ther’s shows. Also I had done 
many small sculptures of most 
recalcitrant clay, some with one 
hand. (Father would tie the oth- 
er behind my back.) Another 
point — even on Terra fingers 
are light as mice, so finger-ma- 
nipulation is an activity on which 
gravs have plus-little effect. 

I could also have contested 
with him at cigar biting, but I 
did not mention that

Ole!” La CucaracHa cried again 
and began to dance up and down 
the altar with much rat-tat-tat- 
ing of the heels and many a 
swing of her delightful posterior. 
At the same tithe she began sing- 
ing in time with her dance a 
catchy song beginning, “El Es- 
queleto, el Esqueleto!” — this 
with a grin toward me. 

In hardly any more time, El 
Toro and Guchu took up the 
song too, Guchu clapping hands 
in time and El Toro banging his 
good one on the altar. Only the 
padre remained aloof, now scan- 
dalized, now smiling in spite of 
himself. 

I found myself clapping too. 
Listening carefully, I made out 
that the song was a revolutionary 
one about the coming of the 
Tall Death, el Esqueleto, and 
I began to feel strongly the 
pull of this part. To play 
Death himself before audi- 
ences who both feared and adored 
— what a challenge! Or rather 
what a cinch part, a sure hit! 

Rosa ended her dance in an 
electric storm of stampings. 

I rumbled impulsively, “Se- 
nores y senorita sublima! If 
you’ll guarantee to get me to 
Yellowknife within three weeks. 
I’ll guarantee to make at least a 
trial appearance as El Esquele- 
io” 

"My Kero!” Rosa cried, run- 
lung to me along the altar top. 

68 



“Mi heroe de la Revolucion!” 
We embraced most warmly, and 
the kissing shower began again. 

Nor did we interrupt it when 
we heard the great doors open 
behind us and bare feet come 
running across the dirt. Nor even 
when there was the measured 
thud of the hooves of a horse 
walking. In fact, the only thing 
that made us pull apart was 
Rachel Vachel calling out, “Lov- 
er, I forgot your luggage, so — 
What are you doing huggin' and 
lovin’ up that prancing, squash- 
ed-down, she-greaser hot-pants, 
Rosa Morales?” 

S he had ridden her white horse 
into the church. The kneel- 
ing ones had at last sprung 
up and scattered to the side 
walls. The two Mexes who had 
run in ahead of her had darted 
behind the altar and were ex- 
citedly conferring with El Toro; 
but I had no attention to spare 
for anyone but Rachel Vachel. 
The Black Madonna’s pale face 
and deadly eyes were paler and 
deadlier yet with' fury. 

“I am merely joining your rev- 
olution, dear,” I called to her 
with consummate adroitness. 

Never has a clever remark of 
mine been more completely ig- 
nored. Clearly the two women 
now had eyes and ears only for 
each other. 

Quite unintimidated by Rachel 
GALAXY 




Vachel’s size and anger, Rosa 
snatched off her high-heeled 
shoes and grasping them as 
weapons, jeered, “Hot-pants you 
denominate me? — when it is 
well known you patronize our 
revolution only to obtain the em- 
braces of some of the cruder and 
badder-tasted members of our 
following!” 

“I don’t give a hoot what you 
say about me, you Juarez whore.” 
Rachel retorted, “just so long as 
you keep your cotton-pickin’ 
hands off Captain Skull. He’s my 
property.” 

“Your property! Did you not 
but now witness how fiercely he 
fondled me? And he has most re- 
cently, let me inform you, fought 
a duel with El Toro, with myself 
as the prize, and won! He is mine 
I tell you — mine, mine, mine!” 

I made a last and most risky 
effort, though I stated only pur- 
est truth. “Lovely ladies,” I rum- 
bled, “cease this disastrotis quar- 
rel. I love you both’ equally." 

“He is a bees-bonnet, but mine, 
affianced in Holy Church' — you 
Texan man stealerl” was La Cu- 
caracha’s answer. 

“He’s ravin’. While single-hand- 
ed routin’ two hundred soldiers, 
he got a head-wound — which’ is 
somethin’ you’d never notice or 
comfort him for, you chihuahua 
in rut!” was Rachel’s interpreta- 
tion. 

A hand grasped my Moulder

from behind. It was El Toro, 
who said to me rapidly, “Make 
no interference, camarado. They 
must fight it out themselves! 
for — ay, Dios! — is it the 
twentieth time? Each thinks 
herself the heroine solo of 
the revolution. Meanwhile I 
am told the crowd has gather- 
ed. You must instantly prepare 
your speech to them, camarado. 
I will introduce you briefly. 
You enter beside Camarada La- 
mar for maximum effect — your 
costumes match — if she’s still in 
shape to walk.” 

“Elefante! No, Jiraia!" Rosa 
was meanwhile shrieking at Com- 
rade Lamar. “And no good in bed 
either, as all males testify.” 
Rachel’s hands dropped to her 
lightning pistols. 

“That’s right, shoot me! Kill 
me in Holy Church,” Rosa re- 
sponded triumphantly. “Prove 
you are no true daughter of the 
revolution, but only arrogant 
Texan. 

"D achel’s hands came together 
and unbuckled her gun-belt, 
let it drop on her mount’s neck. 
Then she vaulted down nimbly 
and, touching her horse, pointed 
to a sidewall and ordered, 
“There, Silver!” The beast obey- 
ed docilely, joining the white- 
eyed Mexes crouching among the 
demon-eyed carvings. 

RacHel Vadid walked stead-

ily toward the altar, swinging 
her black crop. “I’m merely going 
to turn you over my knee,” she 
announced casually, “and lam- 
bast the skin off that overactive 
and overambi^ous rump of 
yours.” 

“And I — oh, I shall rip your 
most unattractive flesh to even 
less attractive tatters 1” Rosa re- 
plied, raising her spike-heeled 
slippers. 

I watched with a deep concern 
and horrid fascination, but 
somewhat abstractedly. I was 
very busy reviewing my Spanish 
and putting together the first 
half-dozen sentences of a revo- 
lutionary oration by Death the 
Liberator. I knew if I got them 
exactly right, the rest would be 
a breeze. 

Suddenly sacrificing what help- 
in-altitude the altar gave her, 
Rosa leaped down, sprinted at 
Rachel and at the last instant 
threw up her bare feet, so that 
she sailed through the air, a 
straight-legged projectile with 
heels aimed at her opponent’s 
midriff. 

Rachel slipped aside with 
startling litheness, caught loose 
hold of Rosa’s waistband and 
gave a tug that accelerated her 
progress through the air; she also 
got in a slash with her crop. 

But Rosa’s reaching sidewise 
with one of Her slippers, ripped 
Rachel’s shirt across at the waist 
70 



and scored the flesh beneath. 
Now she landed on the hard 
earthen floor in a painful skid, 
which she quickly turned into a 
roll and was on her feet again, 
instantly sprinting back toward 
her adversary, who stood crouch- 
ed and ready. 

Again at the last instant Rosa 
launched herself through the air, 
this time head-first. Again Ra- 
chel slipped to one side. 

But Rosa had launched her- 
self, not straight at her oppo- 
nent, but toward one side — and 
she had picked the right one. At 
the instant her head thudded in- 
to Rachel’s belly, the Texan girl 
brought her hand down on 
Rosa’s neck in a vicious chop. 

Rachel sat down heavily and 
turned a pale shade of green. 

Rosa, rolling away, writhed on 
the dirt, clasping her neck and 
crying feebly, “Aii, ait, mi cafee- 
za! Oh, my poor head!” 

T?1 Toro came running forward, 
called authoritatively, “All 
right, all right, fight’s over. De- 
clared a draw! Now we get out 
there before the crowd riots.” 

I told him about my weak bat- 
teries. He helped me over to Sil- 
ver, and we made rapid replace- 
ments. I surged with electric 
power. 

Meanwhile the girls were stag- 
gering painfully to their feet, 
both bent over.

“Come on, come onl” El Toro 
ordered. “I go first with Father 
Francisco; Rosa, you follow with 
Guchu. Lamar, you’re beside El 
Esgueleto — and get that cloak 
around you tight, camarado, and 
throw forward your hood — we 
don’t want to flash that skeleton 
until you start to speak.’’ 

Rosa, still reeling a little and 
moaning and holding her head, 
took Guchu’s hand and inquired, 
“Does the back of my skirt still 
exist?" 

“Sure does,” the Buddhist told 
her, “Though I can’t vouch the 
same for your underpants. But 
don’t worry, you look fine. Just 
spit on your hand and wipe the 
(irt off your face.” 

Rachel, composing her features 
and holding herself erect with 
difficulty and I was sure some 
pain, took light hold of my hand, 
holding it shoulder high, as if 
we were about to dance a minu- 
et. She said to me out of the 
comer of her mouth, “You loose- 
livin’, false-hearted dastard, you. 
I still think I’m going to up- 
chuck.” 

“If you do, play it straight,” I 
told her in the same fashion. “It 
will vastly impress the audience 
to learn that you are here de- 
spite serious illness. Come on 
now, make a good entrance. 
Tum-te-#um.” 

“That’s right, the play’s the 
thing,” she replied.

Father Franciseo, passing 
Rosa with his robes a-flap, said, 
“Fifty Hail Marys, my daugh- 
ter, and fifty Our Fathers. Se- 
norita Lamar,” he called, “exam- 
ine your protestant conscience 
and please, do not again ride the 
horse into my church.” 

The doors before us swvmg 
open, four bent-backs pushing 
each, and we walked down into 
a shallow sea of torchlight, 
swarthy faces and noise. 




In the Cemetery 

Qnugly wrapped in my black 
cloak and hood, I sat toward 
the back of the bandstand in the 
endmost of a row of chairs oc- 
cupied by my new comrades from 
the church. 

Outwardly I was serene. In- 
wardy I was critically furious at 
the performance being put on by 
the Revolutionary Committee. 

It had no oomph. It lacked pa- 
zazz. In short, it was lousy thea- 
ter. 

And as for the rabble-rousing 
fieriness, weU, it wouldn’t have 
ignited phosphorus. 

It wasn’t that they didn’t have 
a big and potentially responsive 
audience. From the bandstand to 
the flower-embowered moonlit

little houses, and spreading into 
the street on one side and the 
cemetery on the other, was a 
dense expanse of intent little 
faces, with here and there a torch 
streaming in the gusts of wind as 
fascinatingly as the candles had 
burned upward. And the crowd 
did respond at times, but only 
with scattered listless applause 
and weary cheers which I could 
tell were directed by a few dis- 
persed claque-leaders. While like 
a burning evergreen forest, there 
wafted from them to us the piney 
odor of pot. 

The crowd was so huge and 
the whole meeting so open that 
I asked Rachel, out of the cor- 
ner of my moutii, "Darling 
heart, how in Terra are you al- 
72 



lowed to get away with gather- 
ings like this? A deaf, blind man 
could smeU it five kilometers

take, but — ” 

“You faithless cad, how dare 
you speak to me?” she replied, 
likewise sotto voce. “Yeah, those 
greasers stink, all right Come the 
revolution, they^ll scrub and take 
showers and like it! The fact is 
that Daddy and the others are 
convinced these meetings are just 
a harmless catharsis for Mcxes, 
the emotional equivalent of Co-

And how right they are, sweet- 
heart, I thought but did not say. 

“ — but tonight wc’ll show them

thia for a long moment, then an- 
grily jerked her hand away. 

1 blinked at a HrigEtly Haloed 
rather long flasH of wtiite 
light beyond some low Idlls be- 
yond Oreasertown. It was as if a 
brighter moon had started to 
rise there, then decided not to. I 
glanced around uneasily, moving 
eyes only, but no one else seemed 
to be concerned about the phe- 
nomenon. 

A half minute or so later, there 
came a shattering boom and a 
great gust of wind out of Greas- 
ertown. I am stage-trained to 
show no reaction to loud sounds 
unconnected with the play, to 
scuffles in the audience, or even 
the smell of smoke, but this time 
it was hard for me to hold still, 
and I marveled that beyond a 
few jerks of startlement around 
me and brief overshoulder looks 
by members of the audience, a 
few rising to stare, there were no 
reactions from actors or observ- 
ers. I touched Rachel Vachel’s 
hand and looked a baffled ques- 
tion.

‘^batia’ operations, I pse-' 
mime" sHe wfiispereid with a 
^i^t ^Hrug. “You’ve got to ex- 
pect those all the time in Texas, 
Scully. Most likely from one of 
those new outsize oilwells. They 
have been working on those 
twenty-four hours a day.” 

And now my attention was 
riveted by a darir cloud, ghostly 
gray in the moonlight and shaped 
like a slender toadstool, risen 
from the point on the horizon 
where I had seen the flash. Even 
as I watched, it grew taller. A 
most menacing specter. It made 
me shiver. Yet no one around me 
seemed to take note. 

I decided that Texans, and 
perhai>s especially Mexican Tex- 
ans, were stolid creatures indeed, 
and in addition permanently 
doped with weed. Which per- 
haps accounted, it occurred to 
me, for our revolutionary per- 
formance beginning and contin- 
uing as such a gutless turkey. 
First, Father Francisco had 
opened the meeting with a long, 
inaudible prayer, then delivered 
himself of some homilies con- 
veying that the practice of revo- 
lution was something like go- 
ing to church, a duty-enforced 
activity such' as prayer, confes- 
sion and masses for the dead. 

Next Guchu had done his act, 
sprightlier at least. He kept wav- 
ing his staff and bounding out of 
and, purely by acddent I be-

Ceve, back into the two spotlights 
the bandstand boasted, so that 
for the audience he was continu- 
ously appearing and disappear- 
ing. his orange and yellow robes 
flapping from ^being into non-be- 
lag. Likewise, he was using the 
tnike half the time and not using 
It the other half, so that especi- 
ally for those farther back than 
the tenth row, his voice was al- 
ternately a raucous roar and a 
faint screech. As for what he ac- 
tually said, well, “Kill the ofay 
in crib and catafalque! Kill the 
ofay in yourselves. Red heavens 
and green hells and God a gray 
fume binding them,” might like 
his whole act have been barely 
acceptable in black comedy, but 
hardly here. 

Even the female and child — 
and so presumably uncyborged 
— Mexes seemed more puzzled 
than amused by his antics. 

Now El Toro was orating, and 
a little more to the point, too — 
that is, if what I took for a se- 
ries of punchy but unrelated sen- 
tences cribbed from the writings 
of Marx and Lenin, rather poor- 
ly translated into Spanish, might 
be considered an oration. But he 
worked too close to the mike, so 
that his every fourth word blared 
out of recognition. 

"Desides, El Toro spent too 
much time flexing his bi- 
ceps, sometimes one — simul- 

74 



taneously showing off his imim- 
pressive profile — sometimes 
both together, accompanied by a 
white-toothed glare. He may 
have thought he was symboliz- 
ing the strength of the working, 
or rather cyborged, class. To the 
audience, I think, it gave the 
impression that he intended to 
conduct the entire revolution 
without assistance, in the fash- 
ion of the primitive cartoon char- 
acter Mighty Mouse, or else that 
he was advertising a course in 
body-building. It made me think 
of some of our worst athletic 
types in Circumluna, forever 
showing off their bulk of un- 
needed, unesthetic, striated mus- 
cle. ' 

Neither of the women had 
spoken, I suppose in accordance 
with the ancient habit of Latin 
males of hogging aU the avail- 
able lamplight. I was sure La 
Cucaracha could have done a 
snappier job than any of them, 
while even one of Rachel Va- 
chel’s recitations of one of her 
revolutionary poems would have 
been preferable. I was sure she 
must, in her spare moments, have 
dashed off a whole lingerie draw- 
er full of them, beginning with 
lines like, “Shuck off, ye Mexes 
all, your servile yokes,” and 
rhyming that with such gems as, 
“And take at tyrant Texans 
healthy pokes.” 

Just then I heard El Toro say- 
GALAXY 




ing, “And now, comrades, it is 
my great privilege and colossal 
pleasure to introduce one who 
though from another sphere — ” 

He was introducing me. And 
he was going to take a half hour 
to do it, as is the custom with all 
masters of ceremony, whether 
ragged revolutionaries or reac- 
tionaries clad in as somber styl- 
ishness as banks. Eluring that 
thirty rriinutes he would say bad- 
ly everything I intended to say, 
putting the audience totally to 
sleep, and leaving me nothing to 
do but take one bow, or con- 
ceivably two. 

Filling my chest, I stood up 
and let off with a growl intended 
to shiver and split the tombstones 
in the cemetery. Then I walked 
forward, deliberately stamping 
my titanium footplates on the 
bandstand’s aluminum floor, so 
that it rang out like a cacophon- 
ous gong and was surely dented. 

I kicked over the mike, placed 
myself precisely at the conver- 
gence of the spotlights, threw 
back my hood and cloak, and 
said in my saturate-the-Sack 
voice, spacing the words rather 
widely and the sentences even 
more so, “Yo soy la Muerta. Per- 
TO la Vida tambien. Que VidaP’ 

My audience, who looked like 
a beach of dark pebbles each 
topped with darker sea-moss, 
shrank in terror, gasped in awe, 
and burst into laughter. 

A SPECTER IS HAUKTING TEXAS 



T offer no explanation as to how 
I could achieve this merely 
by saying, “I am the Death. But 
also the Life. What Life!” ac- 
companying the last with a 
shnigging of the shoulders, a 
spreading of the unturned hands, 
and a certain cocking of the 
head which gave the impression 
I had winked, though actually I 
had not. 

The actor’s high art is a mys- 
tery. 

Naturally El Toro, misjudging 
everything, thought the laughter 
showed I’d wrecked the scene, 
and naturally he tried to circle 
in front of me to save it, though 
in that stage position he would 
have been well underneath the 
beams of both spots. 

I rammed him into his chair, 
not with a contact shove, which 
if successful merely moves the 
body and often has unforseen 
comic consequences, such as an 
overturned chair plus pratt-fall 
— but with a faked, or theatrical 
shove, which never touches the 
body, but stuns the mind and is 
foolproof. 

Grinning widely at my audi- 
ence, I confided to them in a 
voice which carried to the back 
row as clearly as did my gleam- 
ing teeth, “Comrades of the Rev- 
olution! As you well know, I 
come from a very far country and 
over an electrified fence wliicfi 
only I can cross — a fence high

as die sky and dark as all mys- 
tery. It was a long and hungry 
joumeir. The pickings were slim, 
as yoB can see for yourselves.” I 
somewhat elaborately indicated 
my ideaming skeleton and the 
hardly less slender, black rest of 
me. “But now, comrades,” I con- 
tinued ogreishly, leaning forward, 
“now that I am in Texas, 1 in- 
tend to feed weU.” And I gave 
them another long flash of my 
teeth, somewhat hastily adding 
— for several of my audience ap- 
peared about to run, “All of us 
shall feed well, comrades.” 

I faked tossing something into 
the air. I thought of it as a small 
human head, so presumably my 
audience did too. I narrowly 
watched its ascent and fall, and 
at the last moment ducked my 
skull sideways and snapped my 
jaw on it, with a canine growl 
that I made suggest also a 
crunch. 

I chewed with relish’, then 
swallowed with a head-rocking 
bob of Adam’s apple. “That was 
Chaparral Houston Hunt, Vice- 
Commander-in-Chief of the Tex- 
as Rangers,” I explained. “Tough, 
but juicy.” 

My audience also ate it up — 
my acting, I mean — ate it up 
so mudi that I repeated that bit 
with the fancied heads of Sheriff 
Chase and Mayor Btirleson. Then 
I dsoided it was time to state my 
simple revolutionary platform. 

7 < 



“Yes, comrades, you and I 
shall feed well, once the revolu- 
tion is won. Free banquets for 
alll No more worki Free clothing 
— wardrobes of the most beau- 
tiful I Travel everywhere! Homes 
too luxurious for anyone to wish 
ever to leave! Two women for 
every man! And,” I added, since 
I could see dark feminine frowns 
in the first rows, “a wholly faith- 
ful and ever attentive husband, 
gallant as a grandee, for every 
woman!” 

\ diversion was needed before 
they puzzled too long over 
that amazing paradox. Accord- 
ingly, a dog yelped, as though 
demanding food, or more food. 
I looked about to see where the 
hungry animal was. My audience 
began to do so too. I glanced im- 
der the chairs of my comrades 
on the bandstand. I even knelt 
and looked under the bandstand 
itself, my lips oi>en all the while, 
as if in wonder, but iinmoving. 
I shaded my eyes, gazing into the 
distance. The yelps continued. 
My audience was consumed with 
curiosity. 

Then I faced front and smiled, 
raising my eye brows and one 
finger in the fashion of one who 
has suddenly discovered the so- 
lution to a problem. I tossed up 
another imaginary head. The 
yelping became wildly eager. I 
caught the head with a crunch of 

GALAXY 




my side-teetK, and tHe yelps 
changed to snarly, greedy moutH- 
ings. 

I am by no means the Lima- 
Terra pair’s greatest ventrilo- 
quist, but I have as much com- 
mand of that limited art as is 
proper for its greatest actor. I 
also sing and dance and do the 
freefall equivalent of jugghng, 
which involves boimcing resilient 
objects off a surface. 

At any rate I pleased my sim- 
ple audience, who were altogeth- 
er charmed to discover that the 
yelping dog had deceived me by 
hiding inside me. When their 
laughter and applause began to 
fade, I explained, “That was Gov- 
ernor Lamar,” and I tossed up 
another head and captured it with 
my mouth, this time omitting 
the crunch. I grinningly rolled it 
about inside my cheeks and fi- 
nally swallowed it without chew- 
ing. 

“And that was his beautiful 
daughter, who spends your right- 
ful wealth in tinseled theatrical 
displays,” I announced, licking 
my lips. “Very tasty.” 

Through the renewed laugh- 
ter, chiefly male, I spotted Ra- 
chel Vachel’s gasp and stifled 
giggles behind me. If they had 
been any louder, I’d have thrown 
something at her, probably the 
mike at my feet. An actress who 
breaks up because of private on- 
stage jokes doesn’t deserve the

xialne. Of cotirse I probably 
sSooldn’t Eove started making 
gag;; Eke that so soon, but at 
times one must iostantly follow 
all inspirations of the muse. 

I decided I could now risk 
feeding my aurfience a little 
more brain-food. “Silencior I 
decreed, and when they had 
quieted, I said, "Comrades, you 
are genial and generous. Far too 
generous. It concerns you that 
one mangy dog go hungry, and 
delights you that he be fed. Think 
equally of yourselves, I com- 
mand. Think of your own empty 
bellies, I say.” (Since it was well 
past supper-time I knew most 
of them would be feeling a bit 
hungry.) “For two himdred and 
fifty years you have been 
starved, enslaved, and exploited 
by the white Texans. That is 
something not to be endured — 
not by you and certainly not by 
me. It is to demand, in your 
name and with your help, pay- 
ment in full — aye, and time and 
a half for overtime and double 
time on Sundays and holidays 
— for that quarter millennium of 
distasteful servitude — it is to 
achieve those things, I say, that 
I have come striding from my far 
country!” 

And purely for the sake of 
variety, I drew myself up tall as 
I said that and drew close around 
me my cfoak, reversed to show 
only its scarlet lining.

for something that is not thea- 
ter.” 

“But only short hours ago I 
laid my hand on the shoulder of 
President Austin of Texas, and He 
died. The Longhc^ dictator is 
deadl/ate him. That is a fact — 
fact like the death of a child or 
of a cockroach crushed under- 
foot.” 

XJow I heard footsteps behind 

' me, but I ignored them, deter- 
mined to finish my serious pitch, 
driving it home as forcefully as 
I had my comedy. 

“Comrades, it is one of my 
qualities that I can eat — and 
eat and eat — without ever be- 
coming less hungry or growing a 
grain fatter. Death is never sated. 
Be you like me! Arise, destroy, 
feast. If in doing this you die 
yourselves, you only cross to my 
side of the fence and from there 
continue the battle. So you are 
invulnerable. My hand is for- 
ever over you — in comradeship 
and love. Let our watchword be: 
Vengeance and Death!” 

I liked that so much I repeat- 
ed it, this time with a falling, 
rumbling inflection like lights be- 
ing turned off. “Vengenza e Mu- 
ertaP' 

I calculated there would be 
five seconds of stunned silence, 
then ragged cheers growing to a 
roar. 

I got exactly tliree of those 

80 



first seconds — genuine stunned 
silence, all right. 

Then great searchliglits trum- 
peted on from all aroimd, shak- 
ing us with high-pitched violet- 
white light that pulsed in an A- 
wave rhythm, disordering the 
brains, scanning mechanism and 
fragmenting vision. 

Bullhorns and sirens glared on 
blindingly, shaking us with daz- 
zling white noise which' raced up 
and down from the scream of a 
billion billion bats to gut-loosen- 
ing, fear-enforcing subsonics. 

Only my theatrical training 
kept us from being incapacitated 
by this synthetic assault, vdiicH 
lasted ten seconds. I hit the floor 
and closed eyes and ears for that 
period. 

The sixth-of-a-minute pande- 
monium hid the ponderous tread 
of huge horses closing in on my 
audience saddle-to-saddle on 
three sides, leaving open only 
the way back to Greaser town. 

Then the darkly hooded Tex- 
ans riding those horses cracked 
out simultaneously their long 
electric whips. In a great semi- 
circle flashed the blue sparks of 
high voltage, low amperage. The 
fringes of my audience shrieked 
and writhed. 

I turned around. Except for one 
figure besides myself, the band- 
stand was empty. The footsteps 
I had earlier heard had been my 
comrades of the Revolution tak- 

GALAXY 




ing a powder; El Toro, Father 
Francisco, Guchu, who had cried 
me on, La Cucaracha, who had 
proclaimed herself my eternal 
beloved, and all the other loyal 
ones whose names I hadn’t had 
time to learn. 

The one exception was Rachel 
Vachel. She was sitting in her 
chair, arms folded across her 
chest, gazing at me a cold ques- 
tion which I could not de- 
cipher. 

T was glad that at least one had 
not fled. But why, I had to 
ask myself, wasn’t she using her 
lightning pistols, or at least 
standing at my side? 

Beyond her, more horsemen 
and at least one large vehicle 
were closing in on the bandstand. 

Shouts and screams behind me 
made me turn again. What I saw 
paralyzed most of me, so I could 
only stand there, moving eyes 
and head. 

They say actors are always 
playing parts, even in private 
life, that they can never truly 
feel. This one can. Now, express- 
ing it in no fashion at all and 
so for no one’s benefit but my 
own, I was simultaneously rack- 
ed by exultation, horror and 
shame. 

My audience was attacking the 
Texans. They were scrabbling 
about for rocks — fragments of 
aged-cracked tombstones, I sup- 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



pose — and occasionally finding 
and hurling one. A few had man- 
aged to get past the whips and 
were clubbing at horses’ legs and 
snatching at stirruped ankles. I 
watched while two of them were 
cut sizzlingly in half by the red 
beams of laser pistols. Three of 
them got hold of a whip by its 
insulated section and yanked on 
it while another Mex pushed up- 
ward the booted foot of the rid- 
er, toppling him from his saddle. 
They raced screeching to stomp 
him. 

Yes, my audience was mount- 
ing an attack. And it was clear 
from my first glimpse of it that 
it had no chance whatever of 
success. Only two Rangers were 
in trouble, while over their hood- 
ed heads, the mouths of large 
weapons quested forward like 
swaying snakes. 

And all this while members 
and groups of my audience — no 
of this mad revolutionary mob 
— were shouting, sometimes with 
hand outstretched toward me, my 
dreadful, melodramatic watch- 
word. “Vengenza e Muerta!” 

Believe me, each utterance of 
that idiot phrase struck me like 
a lash. I, and I alone, had caused 
these dark-faced, dwarfish fools 
to fight, to suffer real wounds, 
even to die, instead of running 
off safe — for it had been ^own 
that the Texans’ whips, at first 
at least, had been set only to 

SI 




shock and pain, not to kill or 

even stun. 

I could no more have cried 
tfiem on now than I could kill 
my father. Yet my mere motion- 
less presence was causing them 
to keep up the hopeless battle, 
was sending more of them to 
their deaths. And my presence 
was in no way due to courage, but 
only shock and sheer stupidity. 
Yet so long as I stood there, I 
was their black flag, driving 
them on, forbidding retreat. 
Why, I had even promised the 
poor fools deathlessness, as the 
Old Man of the Mountains had 
the Hashishin. Oh, why hadn’t 
my comrades told me that the 
play was over and I must run 
with them? Why had they left 
the ignorant actor to suffer or 
at least view the consequences of 
his vaimting performance? Per- 
haps even now I should try to 
call off the little morons dying 
and suffering agonies around me. 

I might have tried it, but at 
that moment several actual lash- 
es struck me, and I was envel- 
oped in a cloud of blue sparks 
and ozone. 

But I was neither killed, par- 
alyzed, pained, or set awrithing. 
I felt only a sfight tingling. 

Since my skeleton was exo, the 
chances were at least four in 
five that a lash would land first 
on it, grounding out neatly 
throng my titanium footplates 
82 



and the aluminum handstand, 
rather than shock my flesh. 

With the further realization 
that my seeming immunity to 
the whips would increase my im- 
becile followers’ trust in me, I 
laughed wildly. 

The bandstand was bumped, 
and it rocked. I heard a familiar 
voice growl loudly, “Cut those 
whips!” 

T turned once more and saw 
mashed up against the band- 
stand, almost like an extension 
of it, the aluminum flatbed of a 
big truck. From it strode Sher- 
iff Chase and Ranger Hunt, 
drawing their ceremonial swords. 
Possibly they had figured out 
that my power was of a mythic 
or legendary sort, lying in my 
impersonation of El Esqueleto or 
the Tall Death, and that there- 
fore it would be highly appro- 
priate and also impressive to the 
Mexicans if they cowed me or 
cut me down with anachronistic 
weapons. 

Possibly — yet by this per- 
haps shrewd action of theirs, they 
changed the whole situation for 
me and created for themselves a 
danger they could hardly have 
foreseen. Suddenly, for me, ev- 
erything was theater again — 
theater in deadly earnest, per- 
haps, but still theater. 

As those two big, gleaming, 
exceedingly sharp-looking ra- 

GALAXY 




piers came toward me, I crossed 
hands to touch three buttons on 
my wristplates. 

One of them simply doubled 
the speed and strength of my 
exoskelctal movements. It put 
my exo-motors in high. This was 
dangerous to me; a motor, meet- 
ing sudden resistance, might 
bum out; I might smash myself 
in a powered fall or collision. But 
it was also necessary, especially 
if Chase or Hunt were even mod- 
erately skilled swordsmen. The 
other two buttons untelescoped 
my slim canes — and this time 
I continued button-pressure un- 
til the final needle-tipped sec- 
tions were extruded. I tossed off 
my doak. 

Then with’ a stamp that 
bormced me a foot in the air and 
with an uncalled for but most 
enheartening, “On guard!” I was 
upon them. 

There were two basic ways in 
which two swordsmen can engage 
a sin^e opponent armed with' 
two swords. They can try to take 
him from opposite sides, forc- 
ing bini to keep turning his head 
180 degrees, cutting off his fast- 
est Unet of retreat, and aiming 
to mn him between them. 

Or they can attack him side 
by side. To engage both their 
swords, he must face them chest 
on, presenting them with a wider 
and closer target than either of 
them present to him. 

A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



In both cases the doubly 
armed lone swordsman has avail- 
able to him tactics which partial- 
ly compensate him. To bestn 
with, he always has the advan- 
tage of a single command op- 
posing a shared command: Han- 
nibal versus Paulus and Varro 
at Cannae, etc. 

Attacked on opposite sides, he 
can seek to overwhelm and kill 
one of his opponents with a very 
fast attack before the other can 
get at him. 

Facing opponents who attack 
him side by side, he can con- 
centrate his attention and tactics, 
particularly if he has good and 
well trained jjeripheral vision 
and is ambidexterous, in both! 
which abilities I rank high. By 
swift enough circling he can put 
one of his adversaries temporar- 
ily out of the fight. 

In short, according to the tac- 
tic his opponents adopt, he has 
two basic tactics: the fast at- 
tack and swift circling. 

Tn my first engagement witK 
Himt and Chase, I chose a 
third tactic. In fact, I invented 
it on this occasion. It has nothing 
whatever to recommend it, ex- 
cept that it will startle the ene- 
my, though without harming 
them. 

After a slow, one-two advance, 
I launched myself in a great and 
very rapid lunge at Chase, my 

83 




right-hand adversary, seeking to 
catch his blade in a bind in high 
seconde and skewer him, mean- 
while fending off Hunt’s sword 
with the hanging guard. It was 
a great mistake. 

One: I had not allowed for the 
actor’s ingrained habit of always 
missing his opponent rather than 
hitting him. Two: I had not 
really allowed for the speed-up in 
my motors, with no correspond- 
ing speed-up in my nervous sys- 
tem. I took off so fast on my left 
foot that I couldn’t get my right 
foot ahead to catch my weight. 

There seemed only one thing 
to do. Parrying both their swords 
in seconde — simply shoving 
them aside the easiest way, that 
is — I doubled sharply at waist 
and shoulders, turning my lunge 
into a forward somersault, 
straight between my adversaries. 
For a Thin, I am an excellent 
freefall acrobat. The feat I in- 
tended was exactly like a forward 
somersault in free fall, but with 
one slight difference: midway I 
would have to take a tremendous 
bump on the head; I could only 
try to get spun far enough around 
so that it would be a crash of 
headbasket rather than a crunch 
of frontal bone; I could also 
pray that the Longhairs had 
forged my exo -spine exceeding 
strong. 

Perhaps Diana, almost over- 
head and smiling througU clear

sky, decided to be kind and 
worked a miracle. At any rate, 
there were simultaneous great 
bongs, bass and treble, of titani- 
um and aluminum. My sworded 
arms thrown backward gave my 
upper body forward impetus. 
The weight of my footplates 
drew me down to a landing on 
them. There was bandstand left 
to land on. Though reverberat- 
ing and groggy from head to 
foot, I managed to keep my bal- 
ance and turn around and get 
both swords up and engage Hunt 
and Chase as they came at me 
side by side. 

' At that point I resolutely turn- 
ed my brain off, especially its 
schemy sector, and let reflex and 
training take over. I defended 
only. I fought no habit of mine, 
including the actor’s habit of 
never laying sword point or edge 
on his adversary. In fact now for 
me, at least, the duel had be- 
come rather like that fabled one 
in the American Civil War, 
where an actor on the Union 
side meets in battle an old fel- 
low-actor on the Confederate 
side and yells, “Primes, cully, 
primes,” whereupon they most 
spiritedly fight the duel of Mac- 
beth to the great edification cf 
their fellow soldiers on both 
sides. 

A s my body and nerves recov- 
ered, I automatically went on 
GALAXY 




thie attack, cautiously this time. 
Hunt and Chase proved to be 
mediocre duellists. I drove them 
back across the bandstand. Yet 
I scrupulously avoided pricking 
or scratching them with my point 
— actor’s habit completely in 
the ascendancy, or perhaps by 
now I was beginning to realize 
that my only chance of surviving 
this first and thoroughly lost 
battle of the Bent-Back Revolu- 
tion lay in my not killing or 
hurting anyone. 

Nevertheless, I took advantage 
of a pause in the duel to cry, 
“Fight, cowards, fight I There’d 
never have been an Alamo if the 
place had had a back door I” 

Himt, resting his sword-hand 
on his knee, retorted, “You’re 
worse than dirt, Crockett La 
Cruz, putting dirt on the name 
you bear of one of the great Tex- 
an military martyrs.” 

“Davy Crockett never died at 
the Alamo,” I countered. “He 
had too much brains — brains 
enough to solve the no-back- 
door problem. That early long- 
hair — or proto-hippie — pulled 
a sneak and married a senorita, 
from which union I am descend- 
ed.” 

These insults made Hunt and 
Chase fence more furiously and 
worse. With a sudden bind in 
tierce followed by a heavy beat 
in seconde, I sent Hunt’s sword 
flying out of his hand. Then, 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



having both cane-swords to use 
on Chase, I disarmed him too. 

I stood menacing both men, 
whom I had almost driven off 
the front edge of the bandstand. 

Between them, I saw the last 
of my audience-army running 
madly toward Greasertown, away 
from the pursuing whips. My lit- 
tle assassins, drugged like the 
Old Man’s with hemp, had at 
last admitted defeat. Here and 
there lay a few unmoving bent- 
back bodies. A few others strug- 
gled, pinned down and to each 
other by a sticky white foam 
which lay in swaths. 

At that moment, the last half- 
dozen Mexes in flight — my 
pitiable rearguard — paused to 
raise clenched fists and shout 
toward me. Ole, El Esqueleto! 
Vengenza e Muerta!” Then they 
were running again, and^he pur- 
suing Texan calvary cut them 
off from my view. 

Perhaps it was that little cheer, 
perhaps it was hearing Governor 
Lamar’s voice from the flatbed 
that roused my idiot optimism 
again. Suddenly my brain was 
back with me, full of melodra- 
matic plans. I would seize Lamar 
and menacing him with a sword, 
demand my release. I would — 

As I turned, full of wild spec- 
ulations', Rachel Vachel, risen 
at last and come forward, was 
facing me. 

“My hero!” she cried as she

lifted her arms toward me. “Oh 
Captain Skull, that was most 
brilliantly dueled! I doubt an- 
other man in the universe could 
have — 

Her face was radiant. I lower-

What I did not notice until too 
late was that in one of her hands 
she held her black crop. With it 
she touched me neatly on my 
naked neck, like a fairy god- 
mother enacting an enchantment. 

pain shot through me, followed 
-*• by paral 3 ^is of all parts be-

down with a clank on the alu- 
minum. My upper body would 
have sprawled forward, doubled 
over, except that my useless out- 
flung arms kept Vne propped up, 
while my eyes fust stared hurt, 
then glared hatred at my be- 
trayer. 

There were loud sighs of sat- 
isfaction from Chase and Hunt 
behind me. 

Meanwhile Lamar came hur- 
rying from the flatbed, followed 
by Mayor Burleson and Profes- 
sor Fanninowicz. 

The Governor’s courtly fea- 
tures were red with rage. He 
grabbed his daughter by her up- 
per arms and shook her. 

“Sugar, I’m intensely angry 
with you,” Ke said in tones that 
were both well and yet barely 
controlled. *T’m going to lock 
86 



you in your bedroom for twenty 
years.” 

“But Daddy, I saved your 
life,” she protested in a voice 
that went up an octave and back 
at least a decade into her past 

“That’s not the point. Sugar, 
I’m ashamed of you. It’s a scan- 
dal. Dressing like a man. Wear- 
ing pants, when there hasn’t a 
lady of the Lamars rode any- 
thing but sidesaddle for two cen- 
turies. Ten years bedroom con- 
finement for you anyhow.” 

“Daddy, you’re in a temper. 
What’s somed you? Dicto’t you 
get President Austin?” 

Here I began to have diffi- 
culty following their dialogue. It 
wasn’t that my unconsciousness 
was wavering — no, above my 
neck I remained fully alive, 
though paralyzed below, so far 
as sensation and voluntary mus- 
cles were concerned. It was that 
Fanninowicz now knelt beside 
me, his whole face gleaming like 
his monocle, and began to finger 
my exoskeleton with little gasps 
of pleasure as he traced the 
courses of its cables and the my- 
oelectric leads to my skin. He 
even began to palpate and pincK 
my numb flesh, softly chortling 
with wonder at how little there 
was of it over my big bones. It 
was vile, but I endured it (what 
else?) and concentrated on what 
Lamar and Rachel Vachel were 
saying.

H e answered her question pet- 
tishly. 

“Oh, we got Austin all right. 
But then his Mex houseboys, 
who’d run away, laid an ambush 
for us. Beamed three Texas 
Rangers dead. Missed me by just 
that!” He spread forefinger and 
thumb. “And by the time we’d 
dropped a miniatomic bomb on 
them, they’d scattered so I don’t 
think we got more than fifty 
per cent.’’ 

“Aw, cheer up, Daddy, you 
probably got mor’n you think. 
And you know yourself how your 
nerves get whangled when you’re 
wearied and stayed up too late 
and not had your proper liquor 
and weed, and been threatened 
with death, like when you catch 
cold.’’ 

“Don’t you try to soften me 
up, sugar. I’m making it five 
years and not a day less. And 
what I say goes.” 

“That’s right. Daddy, it sure 
does,” the incredible female 
agreed contritely. “Gee whilli- 
kens!” she added with a grin. 
“And now it goes double. I for- 
got — You’re president of Tex- 
as!" 

“Even thafs in doubt,” he 
said, his voice almost cracking. 
“The Establishment Council’s 
been talking of Burleson and 
Hunt too, and even Ma Hogg. 
Not that I hold it personally 
against you boys,” he added. 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



“Course not. Governor. Course 
not,” the soothing deep-throated 
replies sounded around me. 

“And that’s not the point 
either, sugar,” Lamar continued, 
grabbing his daughter again. “It’s 
you. It’s you I’m ashamed of. 
Wearing those pants that show 
off your legs as if you were bare- 
naked. Consorting with filthy, 
stinking, low revolutionaries — ” 

“But Daddy, I had to dress 
like this so as to be able to con- 
sort with them so as to be able 
to learn their revolutionary se- 
crets. It’s a mighty big thing I’ve 
done for Texas. I admit they 
smell bad, but I bore it so as 
to — ” 

“Secrets!” he interrupted scorn- 
fully. “Sugar, there aren’t any 
revolutionary secrets. Again and 
again I’ve told you to keep out 
of ijolitics your cute little nose, 
that reminds me so of your saint- 
ed, admirably docile mother’s. 
We’ve known all about this rev- 
olution for years. It never gets 
anywhere. It’s just a safety 
valve for the greasers. I admit 
that President Austin arming his 
houseboys has tickled it up a bit, 
but that doesn’t really mean any- 
thing. No, sugar, you’ve been 
wicked and disobedient, and it’s 
five months locked in the bed- 
room for you.” 

Here Fanninowicz tried to ex- 
amine the containers in my 
cheek-plates, and I snapped at

Instead of being soberly im- 
pressed, or rather in addition to 
being impressed, my audience aU 
laughed hugely. 

L eaning toward^ La Cucaracha, 
who sat at the opposite end 
of the chair-row from Rachel 
Varfiel, I asked imder cover of 
the jo3dul noise, “Why am I get- 
ting a laugh on the red cloak?” 
“Because our bill collectors 
traditionally wear a red suit,” 
she replied with commendable 
brevity, beaming at me. 

“Go, man, go!” Guchu cried 
encouragingly. 

“I think he goes too far,” Fa- 
ther Francisco also took advan- 
tage of the opfMMtunity to put in, 
mutteringly. “I think he is of the 
devil.” 

“Contrary to my first expiec- 
tations, you’re doing excellent- 
ly,” El Toro assured me. “Only 
harken to the wise father. Don’t 
go too far.” 

“What sort of revolutionaries 
are you?” I demanded of them 
in a contemptuous hissing whis- 
per. “Too far? You haven’t seen 
anything yet. And you, padre, 
just watch my devil’s smoke!” 
And in a swirl of red cloak I 
turned my back on them befdre 
any could reply. 

Taking advantage of the dope 
I’d got from Kookie, I panto- 
mimed a biU collector walking up 
to the tall door of White Texas, 
78 



rapping on it authoritatively 
(footplate stamps, hidden by my 
cloak, providing the noise), 
pounding on it when that got no 
answer, and finally teUing the 
one who opened it, “Senor Grin- 
go, I intend to stand here, to 
your great shame, until you have 
made payment in full — aye, 
and in double measure, running 
over — to each and every noble 
Mexican, noble Indian, and noble 
Negro alive or dead!” 

As the applause for that act 
faded, I turned slowly on my 
audience with a great pointing 
finger that took them all in. The 
red of my cloak had entirely 
vanished, I was all black and 
silver again. Leaning toward 
them confidentially, with the ef- 
fect of elbow on knee and chin in 
palm, and driving home my 
points with slow forefinger- 
shakes of my other hand, I said 
in my deepest voice, “You laugh. 
You enjoy yourselves. That is 
weU . now. But you and I, 
comrades, know we will never get 
an3Twhere at all by standing at 
the door and asking, or even de- 
manding. Never did even a hus- 
band get his wife by such be- 
havior. You and I know we must 
burst down that door and seize 
what is ours by right. You and 
I, old comrades of the Revolu- 
tion, know we must fight, that 
we must risk death and if neces- 
sary deal death for our aims.”

Quddenly I was no longer Chris- 
^ topher Crockett La Cniz, ju- 
venile leading man of the Thea-

haha. No, I was Cassius working 
on the noble Brutus. I was Sam 
Adams inciting puritanic rowdies 
called Sons of Liberty to perpe- 
trate the famous floating tea

demanding the storming of the

for the head of Louis XVI. I was 
John Brown forging the sword 
of Abolition. I was Lenin telling 
the wavering Congress of Sovi-

construct the Socialist order!” I 
was Comrade Mao beginning the 
Long March. I was Malcolm X 
founding Black Nationalism. I 
was Senator Whatshisname ris-

What I said was, "Comrade,

no engine is as powerful as the

“Have you never seen a man

your foes are few, and they have 
been weakened by sloth, greed, 
and corruption. Be you as scor-

There was a hiss of surprise 
behind me. So I was startling my 
colleagues too? So much the bet-

I stood tall again, eerie and 
distant, yet my comrades’ friend. 
Now I was Frankenstein’s mon-

“You cain’t mean it, Daddy-

“What’s more, it’s just not true

It’s been changing, Daddy.

“That’s another thing I’m

I’m a little embarrassed about

“Shut up, Daddy,” she whis- 
pered with something of a re-

The Invisible Prison 
ill s consciousness worked its 
way back into me, starting 
deep inside and moving blindly 
toward my eyes, the first thing 
I became aware of was pain. 

The pain was everywhere and 
came mostly from being tightly 
tied with a thousand ropes or a 
hundred thousand hairs to a 
flat hard surface with wide 
cracks in it. But I was thirsty 
too. There was only enough 
moisture in my mouth to glue 
my tongue to its roof. And I had 
the kind of weakness that told 
me I needed food, though the 
thought of food nauseated me. I 
also needed some sort of pills. 
On top of that my feet were 
burning up. 

My head was tied, left ear 
down against my shoulder, 
numbing the latter and mashing 
it into the flat, cracked surface. 
The down ear, mashed too, heard 
only my thudding heartbeat. 

The sound frightened me. It 
was very labored. My arms were 
strapped down to either side, so 
that I lay on my back in a cru- 
ciform position which was sym- 
metrical except for my head turn- 
ed to the left The contact be- 
tween my dorsal flesh and the

I tried to think where in the 
Sack or Circumluna was a big 
surface like that. The only one 
I could recall was a big abstrac- 
tion made of thin slabs of rare 
moon-marble. So Murray the 
mosaic-worker had decided to 
incorporate me into his greatest 
work of art! Visualizing ca-efully 
from onlooker-viewpoint I de- 
cided the effect would be strik- 
ing, moving, even beautiful. 

But did they untie me at in- 
tervals so that I could rest, drink 
and eat, or was I a permanent 
part of the mosaic? There seemed 
something wrong about using a 
highly talented actor for such a 
purpose, no matter how tremen- 
dous the effect. But then artists 
and photographers are single- 
minded clots. Some of them 
won’t even read a book or go to 
the theater. 

Photography reminded me that 
I must explain to Murray that 
a good life-size solidograph of 
me portra3dng naked agony 
would do just as well or even 
better for his mosaic and free me 
to go back to the La Cruz Thea- 
ter of the Sphere, where I was 
needed and could express my 
own varied inward visions, not 
just one of his. 

T)y now the burning sensation 
had traveled up into my 
calves. 

Into my darkened mind there

flat, hard surface was intimate. 
I realized I was naked, 
floated a dim picture of RacKel 
Vachel and Fanninowicz gloat- 
ing over me, the latter saying, 
“Clearly he will require no oth- 
er restraint,” the girl agreeing, 
“That’s for sure, Fanny. He 
looks as if he’d been glued down

tite. Or like a mashed giant spi- 
der.” 



gaps in my memory of the last 
half of my trip to Terra. Evi- 
dently when gravitation sickness 
had struck, it had struck hard. 

The picture was replaced by a 
motion one of Fanninowicz bat- 
tling wildly with Chase and 
Hunt. The professor’s mouth 
was open and working, as if he 
were shouting at them, although 
I now heard nothing. From time 
to time he pointed behind me. 



I never saw a man who looked

He was the more active fighter, 
but the two bigger men were 
drunkenly getting the better of 
him. A bottle crashed and splash- 
ed soimdlessly. For some reason 
Fanninowicz was on my side, 
and I desperately wanted him to 
win. It didn’t make sense. 

Then the vampire-smiling Ra-

Buddeoljr I could remember 
sounds again, for Lamar was say- 
ing, ‘IDon't you fret, sugar, weTl

For some unknown reason, 
this grisly sentiment made me 
laugh uproariously. The laugh- 
ter came out as a strangling and 
highly painful series of dry 
croaks, but it helped wake me 
up. I dragged my eyes open. 

TV /T y surmise was correct. I was 
glued to Murray’s master- 
piece. 

But something must be very 
wrong with my memory, because 
I didn’t recall his Sack-famed 
mosaic being anything this huge 
or violently colored. He must 
have extended it and touched it 
up with 17 different hues of 
paint — and Murray was an art- 
ist who favored sallow tones, 
such as me and my skin. 
And wouldn’t even a clot of an 
artist have much too much taste, 
or mere brute instinct, than to 
paint over the ghostly shades of 
moon-marble? 

And why, besides myself, had 
Murray also glued to his revised 
mosaic many jagged fragments 
of brown, green and clear glass, 
severs! smashed chairs and ta- 
bles (Hew Had he ever wangled 
those out of the Museum of Ter- 
92 



ran Domestic Artifacts and got 
permission to destroy them?), 
numerous pillows, a lightning 
pistol, an intact monode, and 
— flat on bus bade — Mayot. 
Atomic Bill Burleson oi Dallas, 
T^as, Texas? 

That last brought me back to 
reality with a bang. I simply 
couldn’t see Burleson sacrificing 
himself for a work of art, es- 
pecially another man’s — some- 
thing I myself might do in cer- 
tain moods. 

No, I dearly was back in Gov- 
ernor Lamar’s patio, and there 
had been a sizable brawl last 
night. Burleson, I now noted, 
had his head on a pillow and 
was snoring in the shade like a 
drunkard well soused. While the 
burning sensation in my lower 
extremities, which had now 
reached my knees, was the morn- 
ing sunlight creeping across the 
patio. 

I must do something before it 
crawled high as my belly and 
chest, I told myself for a long 
frantic moment which ended as 
soon as I faced up to my help- 
lessness. 

My exoskeleton and sack suit 
were gone. The million invisible 
hairs pinning me down were sim- 
ply the force of Terran gravity. 
I could wriggle my fingers and 
toes. I could open and shut my 
lower jaw. Otherwise I could not 
bend a joint. The way my head 

GALAXY 




was placed, I could not even look 
down at my body. I only got a 
foreshorten^ view of my left 
arm coming out from under my 
cheek. 

I let my gaze wander out. The 
landscape which last night had 
been romantic, now looked dis- 
mal and simblasted almost as 
Luna’s. The few trees drooped 
The truncated cones, small and 
large, shimmered in the heat 
waves like chesspieces designed 
by a computer. Else there was 
nothing but a plain of pale brown 
dust. 

Except for the big swimming 
pool, everything looked dry as 
the inside of my mouth felt. Even 
the faintly blue sky appeared de- 
hydrated. While I was robbed of 
billions of molecules of my slen- 
der supply of moisture by each 
breath I drew of the desiccated 
air. 

Now through the last there 
came flapping across the pool 
two tiny swatches — yes, Ra- 
chel’s description had been pre- 
cise — of black and orange ba- 
tik. M^th a longing that was al- 
most worship, my eyes followed 
the delightfully erratic move- 
ments of the flutterby. For that 
must be the true derivation, man- 
gled by comedians. How can but- 
ter fly? Every atom of me yearn- 
ed toward and revered the deli- 
cate whimsical creature. She had 
conquered gravity, while Homo 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



chiistophoTus scullian^ definife-' 
ly had not. She fluttered Out of 
sight. 

My lon^g altered without 
changing direction. Now I pas^ 
sionately wanted my exosheletui, 
as if it were my metal Samese 
twin brother or a new robot wife. 

Tt must have been removed from 
me last night while I was 
still unconscious from the touch 
of Rachel’s black wand, or from 
further shocking or drugging. 
Perhaps on the pretext of ren- 
dering me helpless or tormenting 
me, but ultimately so that Ra- 
chel Vachel and her father could 
remove my sack suit and hunt 
through it for the claim to and 
the map of the Lost Crazy-Rus- 
sian Pitchblende Mine. That 
made me chuckle again, despite 
torment to my uvula. 

I scanned all the patio I could. 
Trusty Old Titanium was no- 
where in sight, though he (she?) 
might lie hidden behind one of 
the couches. 

Perhaps I was foolish to be- 
lieve my exoskeleton would have 
been left on the patio, but I 
thought not True. Fanninowicz 
would have taken it away with 
him if at all possible, but my last 
recollection of the professor was 
his enthusiastic manhancfiing by 
Chase and Hunt Most likely he 
had departed under restraint or 
on a stretcher. 



93 




Someone else witH a rudimen- 
tary sense of caution or tidiness 
would have taken it away? Why, 
they hadn’t even bothered to 
take away B^leson, who lay 
snoring as sincerely as ever. Most 
of the others would have been 
close to dead drunk too. Might 
Rachel have taken it away? To 
fondle it in bed? Ridiculous — 
she hated me. 

I recalled Fanninowicz point- 
ing over me during the fight. At 
what? My stripped-off exoskel- 
eton, I suddenly felt sure. Why 
would I have felt involved in 
the fight, unless it had been 
about my exoskeleton? I yearn- 
ed for the impossible : that I 
could turn over and peer behind 
me. Though what use just look- 
ing at it would do me, I did not 
know, except to make me more 
miserable, if that were possible. 

Then another reason occurred 
to me why my exo might have 
been carelessly left behind. All 
the Texans would have assumed 
that I would be utterly unable 
to stir without it. They would 
have forgotten, as I myself had 
up to this moment, the preter- 
natural power in my fingers, toes, 
and jaw. And come to think of 
it, not even Rachel had seen my 
handshake fight with El Toro. 

With a shudder of hope that 
made my hair rise (small but 
auspicious victory , over gravity), 
I walked my left hand to my 
94 



thigh, dragging my flaccid arm 
behind it It was easy. My fingers 
found purchase in the cracks be- 
tween the tessellations and hard- 
ly felt the weight they dragged 
behind them. 

XTow the task was more diffi- 
' cult: to walk my hand 
across my body, lifting the dead 
weight of my arm during the first 
half of the trip. But I am moder- 
ately hirsute around my crotch. 
By pinching hold of tufts of hair 
with outstretched fingers and 
then crooking them sharply, and 
by digging my rather thick, long 
fingernails into my flesh, careless 
of pain, I swiftly accomplished 
the job. Indeed, my hand proved 
to be a most able little five- 
limbed motmtain climber. 

During the trip my fingers felt 
the heat of direct sunlight, re- 
minding me I had no time to 
lose. 

The descent had been a breeze 
despite the friction between my 
dragged left arm and body. Now 
my left fingers blindly found 
cracks again and began to walk 
both away from my body and up 
toward the line of my shoulders. 

Meanwhile I walked my right 
hand up toward my right armpit, 
to provide a cushion for my 
head, when and if it turned over, 
and also to be a brace and ob- 
stacle, so that my left hand 
wotild have its chance to turn 

GALAXY 




my body over, not slide it across 
the pavement. 

At the same time, by moving 
my jaw first right then left, I 
started to walk my head off my 
left shoulder, which had begun 
to lift, and across my chest The 
stubble on my chin — I had not 
shaved since departure from Cir- 
cumlvma — helped, though in 
this area I made little progress. 

My left fingers were really 
working hard now. Thumb and 
middle finger would crook in a 
crack, while my forefinger and 
ring finger groped forward seek- 
ing another crack, in which they 
could seat their tips and take up 
the crooking or pulling job. Lit- 
tle finger helped which pair need- 
ed her most. 

A quarter of my back was lift- 
ed off the pavement now. There 
was a sharp pain in my left 
shoulder. I feared it would dislo- 
cate — ghost muscles are little 
use in holding together joints 
subjected to strain. My eyes, slit- 
lidded, were looking almost 
straight up into the bright pale 
sky. 

There was a moment when I 
feared I’d never make it. But 
then my fingers found a provi- 
dentially wide and suitably curv- 
ing crack in which they could 
nil pull together. My head rolled 
over so that it lay with temple 
on right shoulder, chin on right 
fisl. My hips turned then, so 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



that left was directly above 
right. For tlye present I let them 
remain that way, my body lying 
on my right side. Most of the 
front of my body was ia ^'ade 
at last, though other areas of it 
were newly exposed to the bright 
sunlight, which had now nooved 
as high as my hips and was sting- 
ing me hard. 

Suddenly feeling very appre- 
hensive I blinked my eyes twice, 
then forced them to look dispas- 
sionately toward the hoxjse-end 
of the patio. 

Facing me and grotesquely 
seated in a chair not four meters 
away was my exoskeleton with 
my sack suit tossed across it. 

B ut both my titanium humer- 
uses and femurs had been 
bent almost double, so that their 
cables curled and dangled. The 
delicate lattice of my ribs had 
been crushed in almost out of 
recognition. My head-basket had 
numerous dents. One cheek plate 
had been bent out. While my 
sack suit had been slashed to 
black ribbons. 

Really, it had considerable 
power as a semi-accidental work 
of art. In fact, it brought tears 
to my eyes — tears which I hated 
because I now loathed any pow- 
er of Texans to make me emote, 
but more because tears robbed 
me of moisture I could iH af- 
ford to lose. 

95 




For now my most urgent need 
was water, along with some sort 
of relief from the unending strain 
of gravity and the bumiog, de- 
hydrating heat of the sun. 

I would not Texans for 
help, even if anyone would come 
in answer to my croaking calls. 
I resolutely repressed from my 
mind the vision of Chase and 
Hunt demonstrating their drunk- 
en strength last night by bending 
my exo-humeruses and -femurs, 
and tromping my rib-cage. It had 
been to prevent that, of course, 
that Fanninowicz had fought 
them: he loved my exo even if 
he didn’t love me. 

There was no use whatever in 
regretting the past, or in gloat- 
ing with a masochistic self-pity 
over the indignities done me and 
my dear exo. 

My body must have known 
my intentions before I did — or 
else, already in the fringes of 
dehydration delirium, I was be- 
ginning to act by instinct rather 
than reason — for while I had 
been thinking those thoughts, 
my left hand had toppled my 
body over onto my chest. Now, 
aided by my fresh right fingers 
crooking and crawling under my 
chin, it was walking in a direc- 
tion that would hopefully drag 
my whole body around and head 
me for the swimming pool. 

My toppling over had left me 
with my right leg twisted under 
96 



my left. But now my well-mus- 
cled toes got to work, first un- 
twisting my legs, then finding 
cracks and aiding me to claw my 
way toward my new goal. 

At last I was turned enough 
so that I could see it. Because it 
was almost brimful, my eyes 
could even glimpse from their 
slight altitude the great sheet of 
lovely glimmering silver. It made 
me think of how comfortable and 
snug I’d felt sandwiched between 
my water-mattresses aboard the 
T eiolkoveky, totally embraced 
by sheeted liquid except for a 
hole over my face. 

My fingers and toes redou- 
bled their efforts. I told myself 
that once I was floating on my 
back in that delectable H2O., its 
coolth erasing the sun’s sting, my 
whole body exquisitely hydrat- 
ing again — that then I could 
ponder my next move and easily 
conceive some brilliant plan to 
thwart my captors. But for the 
present I must concentrate on 
finger- and toe- and maybe even 
chin-crawling, lugging my inert 
body to the reviving fluid. 

'T'he whole course ahead of me 
was literally scattered with 
broken glass. I chose a curving 
and recurving route, which 
would miss the worst, but take 
me close to Burleson’s feet. Most 
of it would be through direct 
sunlight, but that did not worry 

GALAXY 




me, now that my belly and chest 
were in shade. 

I soon discovered that I could 
keep my head upright on my 
chin without the aid of my right 
Hand, which was more efficient- 
ly employed like my left — 
stretched far ahead and finding 
cracks by which to pull myself 
forward, a job which my toes 
had to do blindly. Quick work 
with my chin would keep my 
head from toppling to either side 
or from falling forward, robbing 
me of my vision. 

Of course my chin was getting 
well-scraped in the process, as 
was all of my ventral region, but 
this was inevitable. 

At first I would walk a hand 
and with a finger flick out of my 
path any but the tiniest frag- 
ments of glass. 

But then my whistling breath’, 
an increasing ache in my throat, 
dizzy spells or a return of the 
centrifuge illusion, and a sense 
of being engulfed in almost en- 
durable heat made me realize I 
had only a very limited time left 
in which to reach the water that 
would save my life. 

Now I flicked out of the way 
only the largest and most 
wicked-looldng fragments. My 
chin avoided most of the others, 
which accumulated under the top 
of my chest, where they scratch- 
ed and stabbed. 

As I approached Burleson in 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



my giant-incKworm fashion, I 
saw his eyes open and stare at 
me, at first incuriously, then 
with a certain groggy but nat 
over-great horror, as ^ I were 
only one more grotesque denizen 
of the world of hangover. He 
lifted to his lips an open green 
bottle, which his right Hand had 
been snugged around, glug-glug- 
ged a while, and relapsed once 
more into his shut-eyed sprawl. 

It tells much about my des- 
peration and depletion of re- 
sources at that time, that I did 
not then see anything the least 
funny about his actions, I was 
merely glad to get past the big 
slob’s huge shoes, one more land- 
mark in advance. 

I didn’t bother any more about 
the glass, though I was aware of 
certain new sharp pains in my 
chest and belly, and also of a 
warm slime which made travel 
easier. Actually I no longer even 
saw the glass, I saw only my 
watery goal. My fingers, toes 
and chin were moving on their 
own initiative. I had turned in- 
to a team of two hands, two feet 
and a jaw, harnessed to a vast 
indefinite load which Had to be 
dragged like a travois. My brain 
filled with useless visions; of 
freefall swims in the Huge high- 
surface-tension water-drop whicH 
is Circvunluna’s pride, ol Elmo 
harranging me on tBe grandeurs 
and glories of Texas, of tales of 

97 




burning deserts, of my mother 
nursing me, of my father trying 
to explain to me what oceans 
were, and so on. 

A s my fingeri touched at last 
the edge of the pool and 
longed to chmb down in at once, 
a measure of sanity returned 
to me. I realized it would be a 
tricky business to get myself into 
the pool on my back, for if I 
floated on my face, I would 
have no way to get my nose and 
mouth out of the water. 

Accordingly, althougli my con- 
sciousness was now wavering and 
every cell of my body screaming 
for moisture, I made myself 
crawl through a curve until the 



entire right side of my body was 
l3nng along the edge of the pool 
— me still belly down, of course. 
Then I walked my left foot 
back of my right so my legs 
were again crossed. 

Next I worked my right hand 
imder my chin, clutching the 
edge of the pool with it, and 
walked my left hand as far 
ahead as I could and then down 
over the edge of the pool where 
it found a convenient negative 
ledge. 

All this while my eyes had been 
feasting on the water, as the 
thoughts of a lonely rocket pilot 
on his fuel. My right elbow, dip- 
ped in the stuff, knew chilly bliss. 
But there was a tiny admixture 




of apprehension. That water 
looked deep. But I reminded my- 
self that one floated as readily 
over ten meters of water as over 
two — or over ten kilometers of 
H2O (incrediblje oceanic datum). 

I strongly crooked the fingers 
of my left hand. My right hand 
stood lyj under my chin. I open- 
ed my mouth wide and my head 
tipped over toward the pool. At 
the same time my left toes 
found the same negative ledge my 
left fingers had, and they crook- 
ed too. My left hip rose. 

As I teetered there, prolong- 
ing my agony a delicious moment 
and reminding m3rself of the pre- 
cautions to take in water, I de- 
cided I must have started hal- 
lucinating, for I saw a long pink 
snake uncoil its tail downward 
from a top-story window of the 
patio and its long pale pink 
head emerge and begin to sway. 

But maybe that super-cobra 
wasn’t hallucination, for next I 
saw Mayor Burleson sit up and 
stare at his feet. Then his gaze 
slowly followed what I realized 
must be the blood track I had 
left, until he was looking for me. 

I took a deep breath and top- 
pled myself over. I landed with' 
a spla^ on my back, precisely as 
I’d planned. 

Cold ^ock almost knocked me 
senseless. Then, although con- 
sciousness was stUl wavering and 
vision blurring, I began to be 

160 



happy. Water is ersatz freefall, 
but good ersatz. I let it into my 
mouth, little by little. Nectar. I 
swiftly exhaled, remembering to 
do so through the nose, then took 
another deep breath. I discovered 
that the blurring was mostly wa- 
ter in my eyes. 

T rolled away from the poolside 
as far as the leash of my 
right arm let me, then in reac- 
tion rolled back. Through my one 
eye above water I watched Bur- 
leson reeling both from alcohol 
and my disordered vision. As he 
followed my spoor to the pool- 
side, his arms hung slackly, one 
still holding the green bottle. 
His head was bent down until his 
jowls were multiplied. He look- 
ed so much like a huge stupid 
dog who had been taught to walk 
on his hind legs — and to guz- 
zle — but nothing else, that I 
would have laughed except I 
noted in time that my mouth and 
nose were both imderwater. 

Behind him and even more 
out of focus, the hyper-serpent 
illusion or reality continued. Now 
the thicker section I had first 
taken for the serpent’s head was 
midway to the ground. Perhaps 
it was something which the snake 
had swallowed in the top-storey 
room. 

Burleson kept getting bigger 
and funnier. He was near enough 
for me to note the owlish solem- 

GALAXY 




nity of his downward gaze. 

Then he made a stoppy swing- 
ing grab at my right hand, miss- 
ed, and almost fell in beside me. 
After teetering a long second on 
the brink — a moimtain about 
to topple over sideways — he got 
his balance again. His first act 
was to take two more slugs from 
the green bottle. Then he aimed 
his gaze very carefully at my 
hand, spread the fingers of his 
own free hand for a second grab 
— and was funny no longer. 

I did not want to be pulled 
from the pool only one-quarter 
restored. I did not want to be 
pulled from the pool period. I 
did not want to fall again into 
the hands of Texans. The pool 
was not the best base of opera- 
tions, but at least it was a base, 
from which I might for a while be 
be able to conduct independent 
negotiations. 

Besides, I did not want to be 
near Burleson if he fell or dove 
into the pool. The wave he cre- 
ated might well swamp or over- 
turn me. So as he grabbed again, 
I boldly pushed off from the 
pool’s wall with a brisk back- 
hand flick of my right hand. I in- 
tended to paddle myself with my 
fin-clenched fingers to the pool’s 
center, waiting developments. 

er^he flick lifted my face from 
-*■ the water. I took another 
very deep breath. 

A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



It was well for me I did so, 
for the next thing that happened 
was that I began to sink. When 
I opened my eyes I was looking 
up through several centimeters 
of water — centimeters which 
rather rapidly became decime- 
ters. I energetically flapped my 
finger-fins downward. It slightly 
slowed, but did not halt my de- 
scent. 

Too late, it was crystal-clear 
what had happened to me. With 
my preponderance of bone and 
almost total lack of fat, I massed 
considerably more than an equi- 
valent volume of water and so 
was inevitably going down. I 
should have foreseen it, but who 
ever thinks of one’s specific grav- 
ity, especially in freefall? 

How I wish now that I had 
inherited my mother’s pyknic 
tendencies and grown up a Fat! 
— even though it would have al- 
most certainly resulted in me be- 
coming a comedian rather than 
a star of high tragedy. Mother 
would have floated like a but- 
terball. 

I flatter myself that I sank 
with a certain dignity, though I 
continued to flap my finger-fins 
industriously and even made 
some tiny swimming motions 
with my ghost-muscles, which 
worked a little now that gravity’s 
clutch was slightly counterbal- 
anced by my negative buoyancy. 
If I must die, let it be with a 

101 




minimum of panic. Besides, the 
grip of gravity on a freefall be- 
ing tends to make him fatalistic 
— he is in the ubiquitous grip of 
a power greatCT far than him- 
self. Soon, surely, I would be ly- 
ing on the pool’s bottom, nailed 
down almost as securely as I 
had been on the tesselated pave- 
ment above. Crawl then to the 
pool’s side and climb out if there 
were cracks to climb by? I 
strongly doubted my ox5rgen sup- 
ply would permit that, though I 
would make the attempt. 




In the Pool 

A s I sank I oddly noted a doz- 
en or so scarlet threads ris- 
ing from my chest. The broken 
glass had pocked me deeply in- 
deed. Now was the time for bar- 
racudas, piranhas and small 
sharks (but Texans would sure- 
ly use big ones) to come nosing 
up to the threads and then snap 
me to chunks, bits, and ribbons 
in a tumultuous swirl of chaotic 
water — that is, if this pool were 
filled with such carnivores, as 
Terran suspense fiction had as- 
sured me was the custom of all 
102 



evil millionaires, wealthy crimin- 
als and politicos. 

What actually happened was 
worse. I got the impression a 
white whale had dived into the 
pool or a medium-size white sub- 
marine been launched into it. The 
crash of its entry deafened me. 
Sub-surface waves struck me. 
The water was vastly disordered. 
All the artistically curving scar- 
let threads vanished in a pink 
swish. Then a pale monster ap- 
proached and glided under me. 
I awaited with minimal tran- 
quility the half -turn of the white 
shark and the great bite of its 
razor teeth. Considering my slen- 
derness, I would doubtless be cut 
in two. In any case, it would all 
be over swiftly, the books agreed. 
I would emit one horrific groan- 
ing scream and — 

What actually happened was 
that arms embraced me, I felt a 
female form long as my own 
against my back, while powerful 
kicks swiftly propelled me to the 
surface. 

As I emerged, I blew explosive- 
ly, and gulped down great lung- 
fuls of thick Terran air, which 
now seemed sweeter than the 
Sack’s. One strong hand shifted 
to my armpit. The other cra- 
dled the back of my head. I 
faintly heard the kicks which 
were keeping us both afloat. My 
whole face and some of my chest 
were above water. 



GALAXY 



Then from behind me, in 
$trangely muffled tones, Ra- 
chel Vachel said, “You okay. 
Captain Skull?” 

“Yes,” I replied, “but I can’t 
hear you.” 

“Water in your ears. I’ll fix 
that.” Lips and a tongue expert- 
ly glued themselves to each of 
my ears in turn and sucked. 
Then, in a roar, “How’s that?” 
“Perfect, princess. You needn’t 
shout,” I replied. "And now, if it 
is possible, could you turn me 
over so that my chest and beUy 
are not in direct sunlight?” 

“Of course, but why?” 

"So we can look into each oth- 
er’s eyes. There’s another rea- 
son, but it’s too complicated to 
explain.” 

T>y that time Rachel had me 
turned and was supporting 



me with a hand under my chin. 
Framed by plastered-down sil- 
very hair, her face was more 
beautiful than I’d recalled. Her 
skull was well-formed — she 
had the makings of a good Thin. 
She was grinning, as if in the 
highest spirits. 

Whatever her motives for res- 
cuing me — generous, sneaky or 
crazy — I suddenly felt so much 
gratitude and tender admiration 
that only poetry could express 
it. Accordingly I recited: 

Rachel, thy beauty is to me 

Like those Nicean barks of 
yore. 

That gently, o’er a perfumed 
sea.

added.

“THat’s just pluml} beautiful, 
Scully," Bbe sighed, "even if this 
pool ain’t perfumed." 

“It is now, princess,” I told 
her, looking deeply into her shin- 
ing eyes. 

“Oh what a 6ourtier!” she ex- 
claimed. Then, chuckling. “So 
you think of me as a bark, Scul- 
ly — a great big clumsy ocean- 
going vessel?” 

“You are an ocean-going god- 
dess,” I told her. “While I am 
surely a most grateful, weary,

A great wave of weakness 
washed over me, almost blacking 
out my vision. I heard Rachel 
calling faintly, as if from a great 
distance, “Gloryosky! — I for- 
got your pills. Is one of each col- 
or right?” 

“Yes. Two browns,” I man- 
aged to reply. 

I felt her wet fingers place 
four pills on my tongue. I crush- 
ed them between my molars for 
swifter effect and downed them 
quickly with a half mouthful of 
pool. 

When my vision cleared, she 
was still trying to close with' one 
hand a small pink case tied 
round her neck by a pink ribbon. 
Her other hand was occupied 
supporting me. She got it shut, 
but not before I’d noted inside, 
besides the pills which she must 
have taken from my exo’s check- 
plate, a small dialed box and a 
104 



half dozen or so of what seemed 
to be minitapes. 

Referring to the last, I asked 
politely as we bobbed up and 
down, “Some of your manu- 
scripts, princess?” 

“Yes, she replied, “includin’ 
Houston’s Afire and Storm Over 
El Paso. Scully, you’re a skunk. 
Or at least you were last night, 
when you told Daddy about my 
lingerie drawers. He bust ’em all 
up, lookin’ for subversive litera- 
ture, and would have found the 
secret drawer for sure, except I 
was gettin’ undressed so fast he 
had to scuttle out. He likes me 
to hand him my clothes through 
a door open about six inches — 
before he locks it.” 

“But princess.” I told her 
gravely, “you did me, my father, 
and my family a great wrong 
when you revealed to your father 
the secret of the Lost Crazy-Rus- 
sian Pitchblende Mine and that 
I carried it on my person. Only 
a very odd circumstance pre- 
vented your father from getting 
hold of the map and claim when 
he searched and slashed up my 
sack suit.” 

CtQcully, you’re a numbskull!” 
^ she snapped at me. “Sorry 
I got to tell you this, but that 
map-claim business is pure 
dream. Bought from an Aleut 
who had it off a Cree Injun! 
Why, that’s the oldest swindle 

GALAXY 




goin’. Scully, you got no more 
chance of making money out of 
that mining claim than you have 
of making time with La Cuca- 
racha when I’m around. Last 
night I brought it up just as a 
red herring to distract Daddy and 
win back some favor with him. 
He’ll believe anything, long as it 
means more money for him. 
Scully, you don’t kriow the rudi- 
ments of high revolutionary in- 
trigue.” 

‘‘But princess,” I began injur- 
edly. Truly, I was shaken. 

At that moment a shouting 
started at the poolside. Rachel 
turned my face so that I too 
could see Burleson, hands on 
knees yet still reeling a little, 
as he yelled overshoulder toward 
the gringo door. 

“Hey, Governor! Come out if 
you can hear me. Come out 
arushing. Your honorable daugh- 
ter’s swimming bare-naked with 
that skin-and-bones revolution- 
ary from outer space. He’s bare- 
naked too!” 

I was impressed by the relish 
with which Burleson reported to 
Lamar his daughter’s misbehav- 
ior. 

“Sure you don’t need a little 
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?” 
Rachel asked sportively. “You 
look peaked, you know. It’d 
make Bilious Burly boil, besides 
drivin’ Lushy Lamar plumb loco 
if he gets here in time. Incident- 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



aUy» I’m not quite bare naked, 
as those fat-guts insist on describ- 
ing the highly civilized state of to- 
tal nudity. I’m wearing my flesh- 
toned mini-underwear, vdiich is 
all the clothes Daddy allowed 
me when he locked me up — 
unless you count the profusion 
of unshocked pink sheets I 
knotted together for my escape.” 

“Bussing would be beautiful, 
but — ” I began. 

She was already off again with, 
“Hey, is free fall a little like 
this? I guessed it! You’ll show me 
the real thing some day, won’t 
you, Scully? You know, I think 
Daddy’s got a great big sex- 
thing going for me, maybe un- 
conscious, but maybe not. Else 
why this eternal lockin’ in bed- 
rooms and takin’ away all the 
clothes except a tease-minimum? 
You know how he’s always pick- 
in’ off his coat and pants lint 
that ain’t there? I bet those are 
snowflakes from the blizzard of 
puritanic guilt that’s forever buf- 
fetin’ him!” 

“Excellent armchair analysis, 
princess,” I agreed. “But should 
not we be doing something? Soon 
the houseboys will come running 
and then Rangers, I suppose, and 
between them they’ll be able to 
figure out a way to capture us? 
Surely some of them beades 
yourself can swim. And is there 
not a cowboy waldo called a 
lasso? Have you your Horse or 

105 




a swifter vehicle nearby? Then 
there may still be time for smu to 
swim me to the shore away from 
Burleson and carry me — I am 
featherwei^t, you are strong — 
to that vehicle and — ” 

“Hush up and stop frettin’, 
Scully,” she ordered gayly. “Ev- 
erything’s under control and 
proceeding according to sched- 
ule. Now take houseboys. Not a 
one of them turned up this 
morning. That great speech of 
yours last night sure started a 
bully ruckus. El Toro says you 
are guilty of premature activism 
and romantical individualism, 
but he’s playing along. Jeepers, 
what I’d give for your actin’ 
skill! But you’ll teach me ev- 
erything, darling, won’t you? 
Why, there’s rumors the remains 
of the late Austin’ Praetorian 
Guard are holed up in Greaser- 
town. Hunty-Wunt’s having con- 
niptions decidin’ whether to rush', 
besiege or atom-bomb. Hey, here 
come Daddy and Big Foot! Hi- 
yah, Lushy Lamar! Mornin’, 
Bilious Burly! Greetin’s Chin- 
chy Chase! Come on in, all of 
you, the water’s fine. We’re hav- 
in’ fun/" 

And with that she kissed me 
pasaoaately until we had sunk at 
least diree feet, whereupon with 
two powerful kicks she surfaced 
us again, and I was able to honor 
that 1H5 s.<; with the gasp it deserv- 
ed. 
lOd 



tCT^ou swim here at once, sug- 
ar, you hear me?” Lamar 
was raving, tearing his hair with 
one hand and pointing at us with 
the other. “It’s a million bed- 
room-years I’m going to give 
you this time. And no clothes at 
all.” 

“Why, Daddy, I’d think you’d 
be happy you’d left me those two 
scraps of panties and bra,” she 
called back sweetly. “For all you 
know, I may be wearin’ ’em now. 
That is, if you’re lucky. Tell me, 
Scully, have I got my pants on?” 

As I groped for an answer 
which would be offensive to La- 
mar, 37et still gallant, a large 
smooth ‘metal hook settled 
around my neck. Rachel whip- 
ped it off barely in time. She 
shoved it away from us, then 
yanked it back. On the poolside. 
Sheriff Chase staggered and lost 
hold of the 10-meter pole on 
which the hook was mounted. It 
floated in the pool. 

“Sugar, I’m beggin you,” La- 
mar called, on his knees now and 
wringing his hands. “Why, there 
hasn’t been a like scandal since 
Jefferson Davis, looking for a 
place to smoke and purely by ac- 
cident, walked in on Portia Cal- 
pumia Lamar while she was tak- 
ing a spit-bath. Swim to your 
Daddy, sugar.” 

Rachel called . back, “Daddy, 
why don’t you buy yourself a 
townhouse of teen-age sportin’ 

GAl^ 




gals? Come to terms with life, 
Governor.” 

“But that’s not the same thing, 
sugar!" 

During this interchange, three 
Rangers with lasar rifles had 
come hurrying, as far as Tex- 
ans ever do hurry, out of the 
gringo door. Chase conferred 
with them. One retrieved the pole 
and started around the pool with 
it. Chase took out of his pocket 
one of those black squeeze cyl- 
inders Hunt had been playing 
with yesterday, and he inspected 
it narrowly. Simultaneously Bur- 
legbn drew from a holster at his 
side a revolver of ancient aspect 
and goggled at it somewhat 
wonderingly. 

“Princess, we can’t talk our 
way out of this, we must do 
something,” I whispered urgent- 
ly- 

“Scully, I told you everything’s 
on,” she whispered loudly back, 
“but if it makes you feel any 
better — ” She opened her pink 
purse one-handed and clicked a 
lever on the tiny box inside. 

“Black Madonna calling Sub- 
marine. Come in. Submarine,” she 
softly said to it, holding it close 
to her mouth and ear, all three 
just above water. I heard but 
could not distinguish the words 
of a reply. She continued, “Rog- 
er. Look here, me and La Muerta 
are pool-center and we’re going to 
be in trouble in about 30 sec- 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



onds. You’ll be Here in 25? 
Swell!” 

Clicking it off and shutting 
her purse, she whispered, “An- 
tique crystal AM radio. Baffles 
the Rangers.” 

I did my best to feel encouraged. 

Did the p>ool connect with 
a river or underground lake? It 
sounded difficult. Still, the pool 
was deep. There was a big bang 
and something very solid splat- 
ted the water a foot from my 
head. Blast stung my sldn. I saw 
Burleson leveling his smoking re- 
volver toward me, swinging it in 
arcs of about twenty degrees. 

Rachel trod water strongly 
and swung me around so she 
was between me and the gun. 
Meanwhile she yelped, “Daddy, 
you gonna let him kill me? You 
want your lovin’ Rachel with 
holes in her, deader than the La- 
redo cowboy?” 

Lamar sprang up and grap- 
pled with the mayor, who pro- 
tested, “Just firing a shot across 
their bows. Governor, maybe 
pick off the sky-greaser. No harm 
meant your precious one.” 

Chase shouted, “Come out. 
Miss Lamar and tug La Cruz 
with you. No back-talk cither — 
we’ve quit fooling. Boy, get 
ready to boil the water around 
them.” 

The laser rifles were leveled to 
either side of us. Their heat sure- 

107 




ly couldn’t boil the whole pool. 
But maybe if the beams were 
kept close enough — 

Rachel put my. hands behind 
her neck and theh embraced me. 
“Hold me tight, Scully,” she 
said, treading water so that I 
faced away from the patio. Per- 
haps she meant us to die togeth- 
er. Little I could do. 

The third Ranger was reaching 
the hook toward us. But before 
I could warn Rachel, he jerked 
it away in a wide circle as he 
turned. 

Weaving its way toward us 
amongst the crj'-ptic towers, was 
s menacing plume of brown dust. 
It grew larger and higher by sec- 
onds. I began to hear a roar. 

“It’s a twister! Run for your 
lives!” the ranger cried, dropping 
the hook and pounding back 
around the pool. 

Rachel turned us so that I was 
the one facing the patio. My 
hands were clasped together be- 
hind her neck. My chin rested 
on her shoulder. I closed my 
teeth on my wrist to make sure 
my head stayed up. Even if Ra- 
chel my beloved decided to sink 
us. I was going to stay up as long 
as possible. 

The roaring was louder, closer. 
The two other Rangers and La- 
mar were shouldering each' other 
through the gringo door, with 
Burleson a couple of gro ggy steps 
behind, while the third Ranger 
108 



now was about to pass him. 

Chase, still at the poolside, 
was pointing something. Then it 
was as if an invisible hand and 
pen had very swiftly drawn a 
narrowing black line from him to 
us. Its end struck Rachel’s back 
below my clasped hands and I 
felt her muscles go slack, even as 
leaked electricity tingled through 
me, almost making me unclasp 
my hands. 

A s we started to sink because 
she was no longer treading 
water, and as Chase turned and 
lumbered after the others, the 
roar became deafening. The 
plume of dust hit the pool, and 
became a. fountain of white 
spray. 

I had to suck in a big breath 
before it struck us. Amidst 
blasting spray we were tugged 
upward a few centimeters, then 
shoved underwater by a great 
hand of wind. 

Rachel’s positive buoyancy 
more than counterbalanced my 
negative, but as we began to rise 
we were again shoved under. 

Coming up a second time we 
made it. I blew through my nos- 
trils, gasped through my wrist- 
obstructed mouth. 

The tortiado had halted over 
the patio, unable to decide 
whether to enter the house, climb 
over it, or back out. It was still 
shooting up spray from the end 

GALAXY 




of the pool a few meters away. 

“Scully, I’m paralyzed below 
the neck. Don’t let go of me,” 
Rachel gasped in my ear. Her 
voice barely audible. 

“Don’t worry about that, my 
princess,” I replied grimly, 
though my voice was much muf- 
fled by my wrist in my mouth. 
Let go of her? She was my float! 

The tornado made decision 
three. Once more we were pushed 
under. When we came up for the 
third time, we were inside a 
weird, dim, tall igloo of spray. 
The tornado’s eye, I told myself, 
doubtful if there were such a 
thing in Terran Nature. 

The whole Nature theory lost 
ground when I saw, vanishing up- 
ward, my bent exoskeleton and 
slashed sack suit, both in the 
grip of some metal claws on the 
end of a line. 

My hands shifted their grip 
from each other to Rachel’s hair, 
in which they knotted them- 
selves. Unclasping my jaws, I 
let my head fall back. 

Directly above, through what 
might be a large circular hole 
in spray-dashed transparent plas- 
tic, a fierce copj>er-hued face, 
made fiercer by lines of red and 
white paint and black top-knot, 
was peering. Something snaked 
down and landed across my head 
and Rachel’s. Unsmiling thin lips 
opened to command, “Grab on, 
palefaces! Must move now!” 

A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



What had fallen was a npe 
with knots every quarts meter. 
I clenched my teeth on it, tlten 
crawled one hand out ot Ra- 
chel’s hair to clench the rope 
with that too. 

The rope straightened as it be- 
gan to lift me from the water 
by head and hand. With the oth- 
er I gripped Rachel’s unfortun- 
ately thick hair as strongly as I 
could. 

As my body lifted from the wa- 
ter, I felt my neck stretching and 
hastily let loose my teeth'. It had 
been a grand gesture, but I 
didn’t want my spinal cord snap- 
ped. However, I told myself he- 
roically, I would hang on with 
my hands to the rope and Ra- 
chel to the point of shoulder 
dislocation and beyond. 

My head flopped and I was 
looking down. As I felt my shoul- 
ders begin to dislocate in stabs 
of pain, I saw Rachel come to 
and grab the rope herself strong- 
ly — with both hands and teeth 
also. 

At that moment I Had an ut- 
terly convincing premonition; 
some day she and I would be a 
great aerial or even freefall team. 

■\T^e were swiftly drawn 
▼ ' through the hole and found 
ourselves sprawled in a veiflcle 
which mostly wasn’t there. ‘ 

By that L mean it was con- 
structed chiefly of a dear plastic 

109 




with the same refractive index as 
Terr an atmosphere. Here and 
there parts of it were visible — 
motors, a shaft, some rods and 
its crew of two. 

They were the ^^merind who 
had hoisted us and, sitting at a 
medley of metal and plastic con- 
trols, Guchu. 

He grinned at us but spoke no 
word. 

Beyond the plastic enclosing us, 
brown dust was pouring upward 
on aU sides. Overhead, great 
swift-flashing invisible blades cut 
through it. 

“It’s a kack - CACC — Com- 
bo Air-Cushion and Copter,” Ra- 
chel explained over the roar, 
crawling toward me. 

Ruler-straight lightning bolts 
flashed through the dust, turning 
it all dark red. 

Guchu chortled. I felt the ve- 
hicle sharply tilt and rise. We 
were free of the dust, though no 
more red lightning bolts came 
near us. 

Rachel cradled my aching 
neck and my head, turning the 
latter so I could see how one of 
the big towers cut us off from La- 
mer’s ranch and the laser rifles 
of the Rangers. 

Guchu said, flashing teeth', 
“We ride in the tallboy rig-cov- 
er’s shadow imtil we’re out of 
range.” 

The Amerind said, “No dead 
Indians, no dead black, no dead 
110 



palefaces. Good. Everything is go- 
ing fine.” 

I looked around, somewHat 
listlessly. Even sight of my poor 
exo and sack suit didn’t make me 
sad or mad. The last hour had 
been a very full one. 

The sophistication of the ve- 
hicle clashed with the air of rev- 
olutionary simplicity and pover- 
ty I had encountered bx the 
church and cemetery late last 
night. 

“If it’s a kack, why do you 
call it Submarine?” I asked Ra- 
chel and yawned. 

“Because it ain’t one,” she an- 
swered. She was dabbing anti- 
septics and fixing adhesive band- 
ages on my chest. “ ’Nother red 
herring for the Rangers.” 

“And you’re not Black Madon- 
na, you’re Mary Magdalene,” I 
observed lazily. 

“You hush up.” 

I noted, stamped in black let- 
ters on the plastic near me: 
ACIFICPAY ACKBLAY EPUB- 
LICRAY. 

Slowly and with some diffi- 
culty I translated that from Pig 
Latin to: Pacific Black Repub- 
lic. 

Oh well, I thought languidly, 
aU revolutions are poorer than 
third political parties and must 
accept foreign financing and mili- 
tary aid. 

Then I passed out, or simply 
went to sleep. 



GALAXY 





Riding the Whirlwind 

/~\nce again I woke in the Sack, 
but this time my stay was 
shorter. Mother was cradling 
me in her plump arms against 
her pneumatic bosom. There was 
a rhythmic sharp tapping. Fa- 
ther must be throwing a set to- 
gether a few hours before cur- 
tain-time. I pictured him slow- 
ly twisting in freefall, two plas- 
tic scantlings and a nail grip- 
ped in one hand, a nervous ham- 
mer in the other. 

But then my nose was tickled 
by the acrid odor of hot metal. 



Was Father spot-welding again? 
— against all safety regulations 
established by Circumluna for 
the Sack. Very likely. Father 
often broke regulations, but al- 
ways for the sake of the thea- 
ter and art, at least as he ex- 
plained it. Then why the ham- 
mering? — which really was in 
a more deliberate rhythm than 
Father’s. 

Why ask questions? I wasn’t 
hurting. And I was where I want- 
ed to be. Stay shut-eyed. Sleep. 

Along with the tapping, I 
heard Father’s panting breath. 
Rhythmic gasps. Anxiety stirred. 
Father mustn’t work so hard. He 
would die. (One of my earliest 
secret fears was that Father 
would soon die, he looked so

much like a skeleton. That was 
before I understood about Thins, 
Fats and Muscles.) 

The imagined scene altered, 
dropping back < ten thousand 
years or more. We were a cave 
family at home. I could feel 
against my chin and cheek the 
coarse fur of the bear’s hide 
Mother wore. The hoarse breath 
was that of a dragon snuffing 
outside the cave. At a tiny hot 
fire, Father was forging the cop- 
per sword with which he would 
slay the dragon. 

I opened my eyes. The last vi- 
sion was closer to truth. I lay in 
a cave with stubby round spears 
of rock pointing down, I was 
softly cushioned against gravity, 
my head propped up. Long-hair- 
ed fur covered me to my chin. 

Across from me, an Indian sat 
behind a small walled fire, the 
heat of which I could feel. 
Wraithlike flames rose from the 
small red bed whenever I heard 
the snuffing. It was a bellows, 
worked by his knee. 

Across the open furnace lay a 
femur of my exoskeleton, its ca- 
bles removed. It glowed red in 
in the middle, where the bend 
was. The bend was not as great 
as I recalled. 

Pads shielding his palms, the 
Indian lay the femur across an 
anvil began straightening the exo- 
bone further with' taps of a tiny- 
Eeaded sledge. 

112 



The femur was still attached to 
the rest of the exoskeleton. The 
other bends had all been straight- 
ened. The metal where they Had 
been was discolored. The rib- 
cage was gone. The shallow dents 
were still in my headbasket. 

The Indian was not the one 
who had been in the kack. This 
one’s hair was silvery, his face a 
mass of wrinkles. Out of them, 
his black eyes watched me as he 
hammered. Nearby were piled my 
three cushion- cases. That pleased 
me. 

The red in my femur faded, 
but the bend was gone. The In- 
dian pointed his sledge at me. 

He said, “I have learned one 
thing. Death. Without your ar- 
mor, you are very weak. I have 
always suspected that.” 

T smiled at him and nodded a 
forefinger. I did not think he 
would note the latter, but his 
eyes shifted to it. Perhaps my 
hand lay outside the buffalo 
robe covering me. 

I also later learned that what 
pillowed me so softly, with some 
effect of freefall, were three eider- 
down mattresses. I bless those 
gravity-conquering birds who 
think so much of their young 
that they line their nests with 
down which they pluck from 
their breasts and which man 
steals. 

I felt thirsty and hungry. As 
GALAXY 




if the mere feeling were a cue, 
Rachel Vachel and La Cucaracha 
walked smiling into view, the 
hand «f the former resting light- 
ly on the shoulder of the latter. 
They both looked lovely in the 
red glow. Rachel had on her 
Black Madonna garb, while La 
Cucaracha wore a flaming red 
dress with belt and necklace of 
hammered silver plates. She 
walked proudly. Rachel had to 
dodge the stalactites with her 
head. 

Without a word, Rachel drew 
down my buffalo robe and began 
to inspect my wounded chest, 
dripping on antiseptic here, re- 
newing a bandage there. While 
La Cucaracha, using a corner of 
the furnace for stove, began to 
make a gruel of water and my 
protein food-pellets. 

After getting a sip of water, I 
told the Mexo-Tex girl I liked 
to chew the pellets dry. She al- 
lowed me to do so with a couple. 

While the good food worked 
in me, I marveled lazily at the 
amity of the dear girls. Last time 
they had been battling for me 
like wolf against musk-ox. Now 
they had made a truce. I won- 
dered what that portended for 
me. 

El Toro had entered and was 
standing before me, a hard grin 
on his swarthy face. 

“'How do you feel, comrade?” 
he asked. 

A SPECTER IS haunting TEXAS 



“Very much' better,” I told 
him. 

“Bueno!” he said with a nod 
like a gavel rapping a speaker’s 
rostrum. “Very good indeed. You 
shall begin your work for the 
revolution tomorrow with an ap- 
pearance at Tulsa.” 

“It will take longer than that, 
comrade,” I informed him in my 
harshest base. I mustn’t let these 
little Marxists think they owned 
me. “Your metal-working com- 
rades have done a passable job 
straightening my bones, as far as 
I can see. But I personally — 
with the Indian’s help in holding 
and handling, of course — must 
rewind my cables, adjust their 
tension and test every motor, 
lead and part.” 

“Not sol” he snapped at me 
and crooked a finger. There 
strode into view, yawning and 
rubbing sleep from his eyes, none 
other than Professor Fannino- 
wicz. He bumped his head on a 
stalactite and cursed, “Donner- 
wetter!” 

El Toro said proudly, “We had 
kidnapped him even before we 
rescued you from the pool. It is 
he who supervised repairs to 
your skeleton. He worked through 
the night and into the afternoon. 
Three hours ago we permitted 
him to rest.” 

“Forced me to, you mean, you 
lazy and undisciplined sub-man!” 
Fanninowicz barked at him. He 

113 




screwed a monocle into his right 
eye and standing very erect af- 
ter a quick glance overhead, sur- 
veyed us all contemptuously. 

“Understand, pfease,” he said 
curtly, “that I detest you all and 
your ignorant, sentimental revo- 
lution. When the Lone Star Re- 
public, vessel of noblest fascism, 
arrests you, as is inevitable, I 
shall smile at your punishments 
and hope they will be of the 
harshest. If death, then only af- 
ter torture!” 

“Why, Fanny,” Rachel said 
under her breath, in hurt tones. 

Ignoring her, he aimed his 
glare at me. “And that goes for 
you too, you miserable mummer 
from the slums of space!” 

Then he relaxed, lost height, 
and with a shrug that was sure- 
ly only imconsciously Jewish, he 
smiling said to me, “However, I 
am hopelessly enamored of your 
peerless exoskeleton. It is mono- 
mania, an idee fixe against which 
even my sternest military com- 
pulsions and compunctions are 
powerless. Within twelve hours 
your exoskeleton wiU be in finer 
shape than when you received it 
from those Russo-American 
swine, the technicians of Cir- 
cumlxma.” 

I had a great many doubts and 
reservations about that, but I 
did not voice them. El Toro, 
Rookie, Rachel and even the old 
Indian were simply too happily 
114 



self-satisfied and too infatuated 
with their revolutionary cunning 
in having used Fanmnowicz’s 
monomania against him-

Tulsa, Oklahoma, Texas, in 
three kacks taking (Afferent 
routes. We flew under and 
through low clouds ahet with 
lightning, navigating in part by 
an echo device called radar, 
which was new to me since- there 
are neither swarms oi water- 
droplets nor starless limes in 
space. 

The kack’s transparency made 
it seem as if we were swimming 
through a gray ocean. At any 
rate, the dank, dingy super-soup 
with its electrical- seasoning was 
not to my taste. But it cheered 
my comrades because, they said, 
it disordered commimicatkms and 
hid us from Lone Star vulture- 
planes. 

El Toro told me, with mixed 
pride and envy, that Texas news- 
men have dubbed me The Specter 
and that I have been declared 
Public Enemy Number One of 
the Republic. The Rangers have 
sworn to nail my hide to a bam 
door, which I hope is hypotheti- 
cal, alongside those of Clyde and 
Bonnie, whoever they be or have 
been. The search for us has be- 
come hot, El Toro affirmed, with 
both Hunt and Chase living up 
to their names. 



GALAXY 




“TSey going to bum you if 
they can, Sky Boy,” Guchu as- 
sured me from the pilot’s pad. 
“But have no fear. Death by fire 
is purifying.” 

Fanninowicz was not aboard 
our kack, which was a relief — 
the German is an insufferable 
combination of martinet (of me) 
and high priest (qf my exo). But 
neither were Rachel and Koolde, 
which I found depressing — and 
determined to remedy, if we lived 
that long. 

I put in time talking with a 
gray-topped much-bent Mex 
named Pedro Ramirez, who had 
been in a cyborged work-gang 
for twenty years. He pulled his 
shirt off his knobby shoulder to 
show me the puckered scars 
where deep-probing tubes had 
once fed tranquilizers, energizers 
and hormones from his yoke into 
artery and vein. He also insisted 
I inspect the curious callosities 
in his ears, made by the com- 
mand plugs which had been 
housed there daily for two dec- 
ades. Meantime he began softly 
to hum, I think without realizing 
it, a medley of monstrous times, 
and I once caught the curious 
English words: 

“Every day, two hours times 
twelve, 

A million yokemen dig and 
delve.” 

But when I questioned him 
about the details of his gang- 
A SPECTER IS HAUHTING TEXAS 



work, he became excited and 
emotional. I easily quieted him 
with a few calm and eoafident 
suggestions. 

I concluded that cyborging in- 
volves no direct control of the 
nervous S 3 rstem, but is merely a 
means of chemical and hypnotic 
supervision, the command plugs 
transmitting both on audio back- 
groimd of tranquilizing propa- 
ganda and also the orders of a 
Texan overseer observing the 
work site directly or by 3D. 

Or the orders, El Toro told me, 
of a cyborged Mex strawboss, in 
turn overseen by a Texan, who 
in this fashion control as many 
as a dozen work-gangs. 

It struck me as a vastly over- 
complicated as well as degrading 
system for work more easily 
done by machines, or for that 
matter by uncyborged workers 
energized by coca leaves and 
tranquilized by marijuana. I de- 
cided the Texans favored it be- 
cause it allowed them to keep 
the Mexicans uneducated and, 
probably more to the point, ca- 
tered to the Texan conviction 
that Mexicans and other “prim- 
itives” are ineducable. 

( ( A nd those pitiful peones 
don’t even know the work 
they do, Esquel,” El Torn top- 
ped my guesses. “They get pow- 
erful hypnotic commands to for- 
get, when the yoke is off, the de- 

115 




tails and even nature of all labor 
tiiey perform while cyborged." 

"Hyper-Becuiity, man,” GucEu 
nodded. “Surer than cuttin' out 
the tongue and poppin’ the eye. 
A blind mute can gesture and 
draw and maybe write, but no- 
body can tell what he’s forgot.” 

I realized this was why my 
questions had disturbed Pedro 
Ramirez. Nevertheless, after ad- 
ministering soothing suggestions, 
I asked if he had done work 
within the outsize oil-rig towers. 

“Never in those, Senor Espec- 
iro!” he assured me with a shud- 
dering, wide-eyed headshake. 
“No, never once!’’ 

His denial struck me as too 
strong to be true — especially 
along with the “dig and delve” 
drone — but I had no desire to 
torment further in order to sat- 
isfy idle curiosity. So I calmed 
him once more and shortly had 
him asleep, suggesting that he 
wake feeling well and happy. A 
leading actor who is not a pas- 
sable hypnotist is hardly worth 
his salt. 

It occurred to me, as the trip 
grew long and I began to ache in 
my exo, that it would be pleas- 
ant if there were someone to hyp 
me asleep. Somehow I did not 
want to do a self-hyp. I recalled 
wistfully the tender nursing I 
had got from Rachel and La Cu- 
caracha in the cave. I had loved 
them as co-mothers then, nurses 
lit 



within gravity’s womb'. But now 
I reminded myself, slapping the 
rib-cage <rf my trusty exo, that 
I loved them in quite a diffoent 
fashion. The thought heartened 
me greatly. 

My rib-cage was a new one, 
made of solid silver, weighing a 
few pounds more, but with a 
lovely dull shjmmer. Its luxmy 
contrasted nicely with my mar- 
tial headbasket, the dents in 
which had only imperfectly been 
beaten out. 

But by the time we reached 
the central square of the Tulsa 
greasertown, my mood was once 
more as low and dark as the 
weather continued to be. The 
girls’ brief greetings raised it a 
bit, but it immediately dropped 
to a new low when El Toro whis- 
pered, “Just keep in mind, cam- 
arado, that thirteen known in- 
formers have had their throats 
slit or been otherwise taken care 
of, to safeguard tonight’s gather- 
ing against interruption.” 

Tt seemed a dismally high price 
-*■ for a performance — there’d 
been nothing about murder in my 
contract — and I feared I’d be 
a flop. Up to my entrance, I 
kept seeing those gaping gullets 
and also the pitiful bent-backs 
who had died at Dallas, inflamed 
by my rantings. While the light- 
ning of electric whips and laser 
beams framed my thoughts. 

GALAXY 




But as soon, as I faced my au- 
dience I was in a controlled rev- 
olutionary frenzy, sardonic and 
heartless as only Death can be. 
It’s a perpetual miracle how a 
part takes hold and carries one, 
even when one actively dislikes 
the role. 

I was afraid too that Fanni- 
nowicz had booby-trapped my 
exoskeleton, perhaps by time- 
bomb, but it actually continued 
to operate more smoothly than 
ever. What strange and contra- 
dictory compulsions fire men! 

At the end of my oration I 
was so worked up that I wanted 
to lead the mob into Tulsa’s tex- 
astown to commit acts of vio- 
lence. But locals did that, and I 
took off with El Toro and the 
rest for the abandoned atomic 
shelter that would be our camp 
until we headed for Little Rock, 
Wichita or Springfield, Missouri, 
as tactics dictated. 

I wondered at an atomic shel- 
ter being deserted in a world 
that had endured one nuclear 
war and now seemed minimally 
peaceful, but El Toro explained 
to me that radioactives were ev- 
erywhere in such short supply, 
due to their military and indus- 
trial use, that they would no 
more be used again as major 
weapons than the last natural 
gasoline would have been used 
for molotov cocktails. 

To my surprise, Fanninowicz 



haughtily confirmed El Toro’s 
explanation, though with a curse 
for a world that Had lost with 
Germany the industry and pa- 
tience to mine and smelt low- 
grade uranium ores — and also 
with a final sardonic smile that 
lingered in my memory. 

I pointed out that a small 
atomic bomb had been expended 
on Austin’s praetorian guard. 

“A few tacticals left, yes,” El 
Toro agreed. “Museum pieces, 
one might say. Texans are loco.” 

“Your figures on the radioac- 
tives shortage are right. Tor,” 
Guchu said, “but you get the 
wrong analogy. “Last native gas 
wasn’t used to run a motor, but 
to fry a black.” He paused. “Or 
maybe whitey. Who knows?” 

He landed our kack in a driz- 
zle where I saw only one dark- 
ness instead of earth and air. 
Then he turned toward me and 
said, “Real reason no earthling 
— except a few locos with bloat- 
ed egos — would risk more fall- 
out is that we all know we still 
got a little death ticking in our 
bones from the Big Poison War. 
Even you’re getting a little of 
that death into you. Mister 
Death, every day you stay here. 
No, Tor, we got to have confron- 
tation. That’s the trouble with 
you Mexes — always being gra- 
cious to people, to whitey even, 
and smoothing things out — com- 
bo, I guess, of the old hidalgo

dream and your Indian ability to 
take an 3 Tthing that’s handed to 
3 TOU and endure it, like your 
3 mkes, without striking back ex- 
cept for an occasional knife in the 
dark. 

“No, we got tell Mr. Death 
here the truth. Such as the real 
reason A-shelters are taboo. One, 
a lot of them got worse poisoned 
from fallout than the toplands 
— through ground water and 
kinked ventilation systems, and 
because who hits low gets hit 
low back. Now don’t get edgy 
about that. Sky Boy — any co- 
balt-90 in this shelter has been , 
ticking a hundred years. Two, 
vjhitey thinks the shelters have 
got hants in them and he’s 
scared, though he won’t admit 
it’’ 

G hosts I could laugh at, and 
did. Before we entered the 
shelter I peered vainly for the 
moon. El Toro asked with a sym- 
pathy that surprised me whether 
I was homesick. I replied with' 
minimal untruth’ that, no, I just 
wanted to know the date — I 
was uncertain how long I had 
been in the cave. 

“It is the 27th of Alamo, Es- 
quel,” he told me. “Come down 
now.” 

I decided that the Texan cal- 
endar would have to do for me 
for my stay on Terra, or until 
I glimpsed Luna once more. 

118 



Ghosts did not seem so laugh- 
able when I was in the huge and 
shadowy shelter, where our camp 
was dwarfed and faint echoes re- 
turned from black imexplored 
corridors. But I saw no cracks or 
other bomb-damage. Tulsa, I re- 
minded myself, had lain inside 
the Texas Bunker. Dinner cheer- 
ed me further; and during it, 
while still, stirred with after-show 
excitement, I began with La Cu- 
caracha a discussion of history 
which we carried into the cur- 
tained space I thought of as my 
star dressing room. 

It turned out that she has a 
bright hard head on that exciting 
little athletic body. She pointed 
out rather bitterly that a Mexo- 
Tex female is the lowest of the 
low and must have ten times the 
brains of a man to get anywhere. 

She insisted that most of the 
Texas history Elmo' had fed me 
was pure Texas brag, though she 
did admit that back at the time 
of the annexation in 1845 Sam 
Houston had cowed Washington 
with the prediction that if Texas 
weren’t admitted to the Union on 
generous terms — such as per- 
mission to divide into five states 
with ten senators whenever de- 
sired — then Texas would engulf 
all the West to the Pacific and 
assume leadership of the south- 
ern states when the inevitable 
break over slavery came. 

“No Esqueleto amado, in veri- 
GALAXY 




ty it was like this: the wealthy 
gringo junta which arranged the 
removal of President Kennedy 
soon became the entire heart of 
the Texas Establishment. There- 
after things happened much as 
you’ve been told. The blacks, 
reckless and inspired as their Zu- 
lu and Madhi progenitors, carved 
out their countries to southeast 
and southwest during the disor- 
ders following the Atomic war. 
We forgotten Mexes, fiery but 
incurably fatalistic, indolent yet 
good workers and breeders, re- 
mained the imdercats and grew 
into the new servile class.” 

I asked her what had happen- 
ed to Elmo. She said she had no 
idea, but that he was resourceful 
and shrewd under his blather, 
and whatever happened would 
land on his feet. I agreed he had 
big ones. She admitted she had 
an affection for the man despite, 
or perhaps because of the genial- 
ly bullying wa 3 ?s. This led me to 
inquiring indirectly whether she 
wasn’t now lonely. 

I was on the point of making 
time with her when, with con- 
summate disregard of privacy, 
Rachel Vachel wandered in. I 
expected another bruhaha, but 
the Black Madonna appeared not 
to note that Kookie and I were 
moving toward intimacies. Short- 
ly the two girls departed, leaving 
me aroused and frustrated. I 
damned them heartily, summon-

ed El Toro to help me out of my 
exo, refused to see Fanninowicz, 
downed a pill and slept. 

/^ur next revolutionary gathier- 
ing was on Alamo 29th at 
Wichita, Kansas, Texas, a city 
much like Dallas or Tulsa, ex- 
cept I began to note scars of the 
Atomic War and also short Tex- 
ans — poor whites and northern- 
ers not given the hormones. 

El Toro kept me unpleasantly 
aware of the price being paid for 
my performances by telling me 
about the diversionary riots be- 
ing staged in Little Rock and 
Colorado Springs to keep the 
Rangers’ attention off Wichita. 
He also informed me that I am 
creating a panic across Texas. 
Not only is the Mex World in a 
fever of excitement at the com- 
ing of El Esqueleto, but the Tall 
World has got the jitters. There 
have been rumors and reports of 
the dread skeleton-man every- 
where. I was simultaneoiisly 
leading mobs in Denver and Cor- 
pus Christi. Twenty minutes later 
I was captured in Memphis. 
Meanwhile I was seen grinning 
horrendously down from a copter 
that buzzed the streets of El 
Paso. Et cetera. 

I was flattered yet unimpress- 
ed. I asked El Toro how the rev- 
olution we’ve stirred up is going 
in the south. I got evasive an- 
swers.

I told myself not to tHink 
about tixat, but to remember I 
am Christc^Her Crodrett La 
Cruz, touring Texas with' the 
Revolutionary Ramblers on a 
physiologically limited engage- 
ment No joke about that last — 
I was suffering from digestive 
disorders, while gravity became 
a deadly drag despite my exo and 
eiderdowns. I insisted oh a warm 
bath at last, with a support-net 
to keep me from sinking. Little 
relief. Could I be provided with 
a tub of heavy water? That 
might float me. I was laughed at, 
especially by Rachel, who said I 
had more expensive notions than 
Daddy. 

“Nevertheless she and I had a 
cozy chat together, which again 
turned toward history. In differ- 
ent ways we both became nostal- 
gic about the vanished U.S.A., the 
industrial and scientific inspira- 
tion it gave the world, and its 
truly great men — Franklin, Jef- 
ferson, Houston, Poe, Lincoln, 
Edwin Booth, Ingersoll, David 
Griffith, Roosevelt Two (though 
she like Elmo thought him a fig- 
urehead), Dr. King, and so on. 

Tt had been an ideal country 
-*■ for men with grand imagina- 
tions, for geographical and indus- 
trial pioneers — until they turn- 
ed the grandeur to grandiority 
and began to broadcast it over 
the newly discovered mass me- 
120 



dia. We grieved at that robust 
and shrewd land’s fatal weakness 
for making right, then wrong de- 
cisions, and standing by the lat- 
ter beyond all reason and with 
puritanic perversity. The Civil 
War, which freed the slaves, and 
the deals of the 1870’s, which 
again crushed the blacks, recreat- 
ing tensions and problems which 
had to be solved with violence a 
hundred years later. The Great 
Experiment of prohibiting alco- 
holic beverages, which nurtured 
America’s wealthy criminal class 
and allowed it to entrench itself. 
The later hysterical agitation 
against marijuana, with exactly 
the same results. (I was surprised 
to discover from Rachel how 
much, according to her thinking, 
Texas’s sly legalization of weed, 
a Mex smoke to start with, help- 
ed lead Texas to her primacy 
among the states and also her 
domination of Latin Americans.) 
The First World War, followed 
by isolationism and repudiation 
of the League of Nations. The 
brief dream of a monopoly of 
atomic power, followed by un- 
ending nightmares. The Long Ad- 
venture in Indo-China with its 
tragic consequences for all Terra. 

A nation nurtured on cowboy 
tsdes and the illusion of eternal 
righteousness, perpetual victory. 

A nation that sought to create, 
simultaneously, in the same peo- 
ple, a glutton’s greed for food, 

GALAXY 




comfort and possessions — and 
a puritanic morality. Merciless 
competitioa — and docile co-op- 
eration. Timid safety mindedness 
— and reckless self-sacrifice. A 
hard-boiled but docile young. 
Worship of success so long as it 
could be thought due to hick — 
and hatred of outstandingness 
granted by nature and/or hard 
work. Great scientists and schol- 
ars — and a contempt for same. 
The welfare state — and en- 
trenched wealth. The brotherhood 
of man and racial discrimina- 
tion. In short, nul program. Or- 
der, counterorder, disorder. No 
wonder even Texas made more 
sense than that. 

Rachel told me that Kookie’s 
views of the Texas Establish- 
ment were much oversimplified, 
but admitted' her father’s power 
was derived ultimately from the 
Texan Cabal, which dominated 
American policies from the mid- 
dle of the twentieth century. 

She laughingly revealed she 
had no notion whatever as to 
whether she and her father were 
actually related by blood to the 
second president of the Lone 
Star Republic. Likely Lamar had 
been a political name taken by 
one of her most recent ancestors. 
That had become a custom dur- 
ing the bloody years after the 
Atomic War, when Texas con- 
quered — for its own good I — 
most of the bomb -shattered and 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



fallout-diseased U.S.A. and also 
Mexico, Central America and 
Canada, finally establishing the 
atom-scarred Stikine and Mac- 
kenzie Mountains as the Russo- 
Texan boundary. 

I pointed out to the Black 
Madonna that she and Captain 
Skull proved by their sentimen- 
talizing over the U.S.A. that they 
were both hopeless romantics, 
addicted to lost causes. She liked 
that, and I was getting primal 
places with her, when Kookie 
popped into my suppKDsedly pri- 
vate room in the deserted coun- 
try mental hospital, no longer 
approachable by wheeled ve- 
hicles, where our company was 
bivouacking. 

Once again there was no fra- 
cas whatever, no observable 
hard feelings. Once again the 
girls tripped off together. And 
once again I was left tense and 
uncatharsized. I decided to give 
up women. At least on Terra. 
And certainly for that night! 

/^n Alamo 30th the weather 
stayed overcast. Likewise 
my spirits. We played Topeka. 
It was a re-run of Wichita. Out- 
side of myself, the performance 
was strictly amateur. I rewrote 
the script, giving Kookie and Ra- 
chel brief appearances. Thumbs 
were turned down on my inno- 
vations by El Toro, Gocfiu, F. 
Francisco. Latins and Indians re- 

121 




sent wBmea getting the spot- 
light, Ibsf sa^ The committee 
was also shodced by my sugges- 
tion that I wear my blond wig 
for variety. 

Later El Tdi'o approached me 
privately about elocution lessons. 
I agreed to give him same, in 
strict secrecy — a far as his bull 
voice permitted. At least I might 
be able to get him to cut down 
on the muscle-show. 

I decided R. V. and La C. had 
entered into some private agree- 
ment about me. I played it very 
cool with them. No more tete-a- 
tetes. I couldn’t stand another in- 
terruption. 

For that matter, I would have 
found it difficult to be private 
with a woman if I had desired. 
Fanninowicz was forever at my 
heels, wanting to test my exo, 
check batteries, increase power, 
try out new wirings — his con- 
cern and new ideas were limitless. 
I felt like Frankenstein’s mon- 
ster pursued by Thomas Edison. 
I decided Germans: are maniacs. 

Yet El Toro insisted I humor 
the Beady-Eyed Bavarian as 
much as possible. And truly my 
exo was kept perfectly tuned. 

But my physical condition was 
deteriorating, though I mentioned 
this to no one. No stiff upper 
lip, just didn’t want to be fussed 
over. The Menocled Monster 
might have announced he is doc- 
tor of flesh-me<Ccine also. 

122 



I kept reminding myself that 
my only real aim was (1) get to 
Yellowknife; (2) check and dou- 
ble-check on the Lost Crazy- 
Russian Pitchblende Mine, de- 
spite Rachel’s damnably plausi- 
ble discouragements: (3) put the 
bite on the committee and use 
my Circumlunan passport to 
hightail it for the Sack on the 
first ship available. 

Rachel asked me why worry 
about the mine, since it had been 
clearly proved I don’t have the 
claim with me, either in my bag- 
gage or on my person. I wonder- 
ed if I should tell her the truth. 
Concluded: Definitely not! 

A t Kansas City, Kansas, Texas, 
on Spindletop 1st, El Toro 
decided I needed a holiday. He 
took me and La Cucaracha to a 
bullfight at the stadium of the 
former Wyandotte High School. 

I was disguised by a big hat, big 
boots, padded suit over my exo 
and vast blond mustache over 
cheekplates. El Toro and Koolde 
were servants. We got by. My 
ability to pass as a Texan, at 
least under casual inspection, 
struck me as something which 
might prove useful. 

The bullfight was delightful. 
They used hormoned bulls, huge 
and slow, true “cathedrals,” while 
the matadors were young Mexes, 
male and female, who dodged the 
bull acrobatically and even did 

GALAXY 




knee-swings and giant swings on 
homs. Like ancient Crete. 

Kookie told me she had train- 
ed as a bullfighter, then decided 
life as a “sociable secretary” pro- 
vided greater financial satisfac- 
tions, and revolutionary work 
greater emotional ones, while ac- 
robatics were useful in both ac- 
tivities. This with a hearty wink. 
I remembered in time not to start 
flirting with her. “Play it cool, 
even cold,” is the motto of La 
Muerta Alta, I told mjrself. 
What did I need with women? 

Besides, if I held out, one of 
them would be sure to give in. 

/^ur revolutionary gathering at 
night was in the huge and 
straggling greasertown along the 
river in Kansas City, Missouri, 
Texas. The greatest stockyards in 
the world, I was told, before it 
had taken a direct nuclear hit 
Decades later, when radioactivity 
had dropped to a tolerable level, 
the Mexes had slowly built their 
way into it, partly forced by lo- 
cal population pressure and part- 
ly spontaneously, with the resid- 
ual radioactivity providing some 
assurance that their masters 
would stay out, or at least cut 
their visits short. 

I felt nervy from the start. 
Our stage was in front of a river- 
side warehouse with thick brick 
walls, which above the second 
floor had been melted into a 
A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



hillocky glazed dome from which 
there still thrust the huge, twist- 
ed, rust-brown fingers of old 
steel beams. 

Underfoot was a swept, ran- 
domly crackled, greenish and 
brownish tesselation of fused 
soil, its fissures filled with new 
dirt. 

Around this rough nuclear 
plaza, in front of the shacks 
they dwelt in, our audience began 
to gather silently — intent sal- 
low and brown faces with a large 
scattering of darker ones: “stay 
behind” blacks who were incur- 
ably rooted here or at any rate 
hadn’t yet made it to Pacific Re- 
public or Florida Democracy. 

But it was hard to make out 
even faces. Our stage lighting was 
dim, despite the continuing over- 
cast. 

I was standing with the rest of 
the company in the dark inside 
the warehouse, back from its 
central doorway. 

A few minutes before “cur- 
tain time” there was a commo- 
tion as a gang of locals set up a 
wide-spaced lattice of narrow 
black rods in front of and over 
our stage, making it even small- 
er. No one could or would explain 
to me why, El Toro being away 
at the moment It seemed theat- 
rical insanity, further spoiling the 
audience’s view of the actors and 
making them feel like beasts in 
a cage. At least I felt like one. 

123 




1 fumed impotently, knowing 
ttiat my comrades liad little or 
no idea of wKat makes good tSea- 
ter. I scented trouble. I grew 
nervier. I wisHed tiie girls weren’t 
there, but felt uilable to talk to 
either of them. 

And then a minute before my 
entrance, running over my open- 
ing lines in my head, I drew a 
blank. It was as if I had forgot- 
ten Spanish and English both, 
and probably Russian too. 

Instead a wordless sight slid 
across my mind, wiping out all 
other reality. I was in the same 
huge room. It was filled with 
white light, so there was not a 
shadow. Files of beasts lumber- 
ed into it. Men with unconcern- 
ed faces but spattered robes 
struck the homed heads with 
great mallets, adroitly cut the 
sleek-furred throats (each man 
had his one monotonous job), 
flayed off the hides, dismember- 
ed and disembowled the carcass- 
es. My ears were filled with hoof- 
clumpings and great thuddings, 
with bestial gnmt and screams. 
My nostrils were likewise cram- 
med with the stench of frighten- 
ed animals, their copious excre- 
ment and the floods of their rich, 
sweet blood. Other men with un- 
concerned faces constantly hosed 
the killing floor. 

What startled me most was 
that the spurting, streaming, 
flooding, omnipresent blood was 
124 



not a darkish crimson, as I had 
always thought of blood iii quan- 
tity (something I had never 
seen), but a phosphorescent car- 
mine just off fuchsia, suggestive 
of tropical blooms and lipstick 
and giddy body-paint 

Then I was being nudged in 
the side, not gently, and the vi- 
sion shot aside. La Cucaracha 
was reminding me that my en- 
trance cue had been spoken. 

T strode on stage in a near 
trance, my entrance-applause 
a distant soft thudding no louder 
than the beat of blood in my ears. 

I had always tested negative 
for psi in the Sack. But now I 
wondered how imagination alone 
could have created so vivid a vi- 
sion of a slaughter house. 

Someone else than I said, “Yo 
soy la Muerta,” and for at least 
the first five miiuites I felt like 
a beetle lodged behind the visor 
of an animated and vocal suit of 
armor. 

Then either the slaughter- 
house vision lost its power, or 
else I grew big enough to take 
over the role of Death the Uni- 
versal. 

The laughs I got were few and 
low, the cheers low too but gut- 
ty. I think I never held an audi- 
ence so well before. In fact, I did 
too well. I must have hypno- 
tized the lookouts and my own 
comrades, for as I came to the

finger-sKaking bit and “we must 
risk death' and if necessary deal 
death," I believe I was the first 
one to hear the faint rushes of 
air and soft drones overhead, and 
glance cautiously up and in one 
snapshot look see poised above 
us six copters with antennas and 
coils and searchlights and other 
electronic items where landing 
gear should be. 

Then, but not before my eyes 
were slits, the plaza was flooded 
with hot raw white light. 

There was time for each mem- 
ber of the audience to spring up, 
to take one look or one step. 

Then 1 felt the faintest tingling 
and numbing in my flesh'. 

At the same instant eacH 
member of the audience froze like 
a statue, paralyzed in posture 
and expression. 

About a third of them, off bal- 
ance at the moment, tumbled 
down, but without an iota of 
change in the look of the face 
or the contortion. However gro- 
tesque, of the body. 

I shot a glance overshoulder, 
noting that my actions were 
slowed down a trifle. 

My comrades were moving 
about in a slow motion, as if run- 
ning through invisible water. 
Guchu was making toward me, 
where I stood stage-front. The 
others were headed for the ware- 
house doorway, or already 
through it. 

A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



I looked bade at t£e audience 
and, utterly fascinated, began to 
scan their faces one by one. Be- 
ing an actor, expression is a ma-< 
nia with me. 

Here and now I found great 
confirmation for Leonardo’s dic- 
tum that the grimaces of agony 
and ecstasy are almost indistin- 
guishable, though I noted many 
an interesting trace of surprise, 
fear and rage. 

In their statuesque totality, 
the mob was a greater work of art 
than Murray’s “Slaves of Grav- 
ity,” where 793 tiny figures are 
depicted struggling waist, shoul- 
der, neck, or moutli deep from a 
curving surface of moon marble, 
which might be a section of Luna 
herself. 

It occurred to me that the 
crowd constituted a semi-acci- 
dental work of art which could 
be titled with apt ambiguity 
“Field Slaves,” for now that I saw 
Rangers dropping from the cop- 
ters on spinning shoulder vanes 
and also charging into the plaza 
afoot, all of them clad in over- 
suits of copi>er netting, I realized 
that the copters’ electronic gear 
was projecting a paralysis field 
from which my comrades were 
protected in part by the copper 
or other metal cores in the black- 
painted bars around us, but I al- 
together by the secondary Far- 
aday cage of my predous exo- 
skeleton. 



125 




'"T^Ke Rangers, wHo also wore 
owl-eyed black gasmasks, 
were a superb sight in themselves: 
black giants who were a tessela- 
tion of small ebon diamonds mor- 
tised with gold. * 

Guchu’s upstretched fingers 
slowly clamped on my elbow and 
dragged on it. 

“Come on, Scully,” he gasped 
effortfully. “Make that effort, 
man. You can do it.” 

“Certainly,” I agreed, turning 
swiftly. I was greatly irritated to 
be jerked from my supreme artis- 
tic reverie — Death Contemplates 
His Victims — but realized the 
black had a point: an emergency 
was certainly developing. So I 
forced myself to use the most 
courteous tones as I asked, “But 
do what?” 

“Beat it through the warehouse, 
you dumb ofay,” he exclaimed 
with such an attempt at vocifer- 
ousness and speed — and rage at 
the readiness with which I moved 
— that he slumped on my arm 
and the last three words came on 
the in-gasp. 

Since his rebuke was instantly 
provided with the multiple ex- 
clamation point of many objects 
clattering on the roof of our cage 
and several dropping through, I 
realized that Guchu had been al- 
together right and my attempt to 
be a crisis-observer wrong as al- 
ways. (Yet it had been so fasci- 
nating I) 

126 



Instinctively we both took deep 
breaths. Then utter inky black- 
ness exploded rather than flowed 
from the cannisters, one of whiclj 
had fallen at our feet. 

I took one sight on the door in- 
to the warehouse. Then, since the 
erupting blackness prickled me 
through my sack suit, I instantly 
closed tight my eyes, mouth and 
nostrils, clamping the latter to- 
gether with finger and thumb, 
while my other hand gripped Gu- 
chu as I made giant strides to- 
ward my target. 

My face and hands prickled 
and stung, but not enough to in- 
capacitate me. 

Another object thudded In the 
dark somewhere near us and be- 
gan to say self-importantly, “I 
am a 60-second bomb. Fifty-nine. 
Fifty-eight. Fifty-seven. Fifty — ” 
“And I’m a 90-year man, 
bomb, with decades to gol” Gu- 
chu answered the thing — and 
paid for his rash defiance with a 
horrendous coughing fit. 

I continued to make tracks. 
Fortunately, my elocutionary ac- 
tivities have given me a lung cap- 
acity imusual in Circumhina — 
something which had also helped 
me in Governor (or would it now 
be President?) Lamar’s patio 
pool. 

XT^en coimting strides told me 
' I was well inside the ware- 
house, I swabbed my eyelids with’ 

GALAXY 




water from my cheek-plate and 
risked another quick sighting. 

We were almost out of the 
smoke. From a trap door five 
long strides away, La Cucaracha 
waved us on, her eyes streaming, 
her other hand shutting her 
mouth and nose. 

I made the trap door, my eyes 
stinging, and flickered a down- 
ward glance. 

There was a round well five 
meters deep, with ladder rungs 
embedded in one side and with 
Father Francisco peering anx- 
iously up from the bottom. 

La Cucaracha scuttled down. 
I got Guchu’s feet and hands on 
the rungs — he was blind and 
retching from the gas — and fol- 
lowed him as swiftly as I could. 

Koolde called, “Close the 
trap I" 

As I reached up, a incandes- 
cently scarlet laser beam missed 
my hand, spattered against and 
was also reflected downward from 
the trap’s metal in-face. I felt 
heat between thigh and right 
knee, and that leg went limp. I 
heard Father Francisco gasp 
hissingly with pain. 

I shut and bolted the trap, then 
made it down on arms alone. 
Then I was hopping along a cor- 
ridor I had to crouch in, sup- 
ported to either side by Kookie 
and the padre. 

There was an explosion that 
shook the floor. 

A SPECTER IS HAUNTING TEXAS 



Behind iis Guchu gasped out, 
“Bomb weren’t bluffin’, anyhow. 
I hate a liar," and managed a 
croaking laugh. 

I wondered if he knew what 
bomb he was talking about. 

Around that time I discovered 
my right leg was useless because 
one of the femur-cables had been 
melted through. The two ends 
dangled and jigged. 

I also noted that the reflected 
laser beam had creased Father 
Francisco’s arm. The wound 
would have bled, but the beam’s 
heat had cauterized it. 

Then I was being helped to 
crawl through a circular port. I 
found myself sprawled in semi- 
dark among my comrades in a 
flattened cylinder. Someone had 
closed the port and was locking 
it with a wheeL 

Opposite the port was a win- 
dow into darkness. Then a great 
white snout peered in with un- 
winking eyes and with long white 
feelers around its jaws. 

The cylinder began to rock and 
to move in surges. 

Shortly later I was told that 
we were in a river submarine — 
called “Airplane," of course, with 
consummate revolutionary du- 
plicity — and that the white mon- 
ster had been a mutated and hap- 
loid catfish.

and glimpses of exotic river life. 
On his insistence, I told El Toro 
about the government of Circum- 
luna. He expressed horror at what 
he dubbed “Sackabondage” and 
insisted I carry the revolution 
there. As soon as I had made him 
understand vacuum and decom- 
pression, he saw endless possibili- 
ties in bombs artfully placed. I 
let him elaborate his nonsense 
and rested my eyes on Rachel 
Vachel and La Cucaracha sleep- 
ing in each other’s arms. I decid- 
ed that if I escaped alive from 
this mortal Terran bruhaha and 
were able to carry an5rthing back 
to the Sack, it would be some- 
thing very different from revolu- 
tion — unless one considers all fe- 
males conspirators and destruc- 
tors by nature. 



We landed at dawn at a 
swamp-circled hideout short of 
Missouri City. Fanninowicz was 
one of the few awake and on 
hand to observe our limping and 
dispirited arrival. 

“Ho-ho!” he mocked. “I see 
you have had a brush with the 
Rangers! Next time — Kaaaaah!” 
And while making this nasty 
noise at the back of his tongue, 
he drew his thumb across his 
throat. “And as for you, you 
Schafskopf, you bummer, you are 
no fit to be trusted with your 
exoskeleton than a child with a

“That’s how the Circumlunans 
teach their children math,” I told 
him as I hopped along. “Splice

Tn Australia the rain doesn’t fall 
on the plain — unfortunately 
for Australians it does not fall 
much anywhere. The paradox of 
the two southern continents, Aus- 
tralia and Antarctica, is that Aus- 
* tralia is the driest of all conti- 
I nents, while Antarctica is the wet- 
test, though this does not show 
too clearly because all the water 
is in its solid state.

This is the way projects grow. 

The Snowy Mountains Scheme, 
when planning was finished, call- 
ed for the creation of three major 
and a number of lesser artificial 
lakes, the requisite number of 
dams, a total of 24 miles of tun- 
nels ranging from 14 to 24 feet in 
diameter and not less than eleven 
power stations (with another 
three possible), some of them un-

back the waters of the Eu- 
cumbene River. The dam is an 
earth and rockfill dam, half a 
mile in thickness at its base and 
with a height of 381 feet. It was 
built by a group of contractors 
from the United States and was 
cmapleted in May 1958 — two 
years ahead of schedule. The 
artificial lake formed (the one

what its name sa 3 rs, enough wa- 
ter to cover an area of one acre

needs 272,000 gallons. TEe storage 
capacity of Lake Eucumbene 
works out to a little more than a 
million million gallons. 

Fig. 3 shows the Snowy Moun- 
tain Scheme, and in order to un- 
derstand the route into which the 
.water has been forced, let us be- 
gin in the northeast with tEe Tan- 
tangara Reservoir. A tunnel goes 
from this reservoir through the 
mountains into Lake Eucumbene. 
From the southern end of Lake 
Eucumbene two tunnels emerge; 
one goes westward through the 
mountains to the Tumut River 
section of the overall project, the 
other joins another tunnel near a 
smaller reservoir called Island 
Bend Pond. These two tunnels 
from Lake Eucumbene are two- 
way tunnels; the flow can go 
either way, depending on the lev- 
els of the various bodies of water. 
All other tunnels are strictly one- 
way. A tunnel goes westward 
from the Jindab 3 me Reservoir to 
join with Island Bend Pond and 
the two-way tunnel from Lake 
Eucumbene. Then it goes due

west througH tHe mountains and 
ends up, after passing tihirougH 
two powers stations, in tHe 
Swampy Plains River. This is one 
section of the flow scheme. 

THe other section begins witK 
tHe reservoir formed by the dam 
across the Tooma River. The wa- 
ter flows into Tumut Pond and 
then northward into tHe Murrum- 
bidgee along tHe channel of the 
original Tumut River. But this 
river Has been changed into a se- 
ries of reservoirs by a number of 
dams. When finished there will 
be five power stations along this 
route; the fifth, called T7, is lo- 
cated beyond tHe edge of our 
sketch map, twelve miles to the 
north of T6. 

By the end of 1967 all tHe tun- 
neling Had been done; the last of 
the big tunnels was completed on 
July 7, 1967. THe Jindabyne dam, 
.235 feet high, was completed in 
1967, too. Now, However, one lias 
to wait for tHe Jindabyne Reser- 
voir to fill up. A number of tHe 
power stations were still unfinish- 
ed by the end of 1967 ; they were 
built, but the generators still Had 
to be installed. 

The only dam not even started 
until late in 1967 is the Talbingo 
Dam, which will cost 42 million 
Australian dollars (47 million 
U.S. dollars), and it will be 530 
feet high. 

Everything should be ready to 
use by the end of 1969.

fixed size and shape. One might 
say the maps show what these 
lakes should be, not what they 
are. In October (e^ly summer for 
Australia) 1950, a party of explor- 
ers coming to Adelaide reported 
tihat Lake E 3 rre was actually full 
of" water I 

The survey that is now going on 
under the leadership of Ian B. 
Kiddle, professor of engineering in 
Melbourne, looks at the stretches 
of land between Port Augusta and 
Lake Torrens (with an area of 
2409 square miles) and between 
Lake Torrens and the Lake 
Eyre basin that have an area of 
3700 square miles and are, on the 
average, 40 feet below sea level. 
Kiddle’s idea is quite simple; if 
the Lake Eyre basin could be fill- 
ed with water and could be kept 
filled, a permanent large inland 
lake would result It would be 
salty, so sea water could fill it up. 

The question is how easily and 
how cheaply sea water can be 
brought from Spencer Gulf to the 
Lake Eyre basin. Based on a per- 
sonal and naturally sketchy sur- 
vey Professor Kiddle made in 
1965 and 1966, the project does 
not seem to be difficult. It would 
start with an open ordinary canal 
from Port Augusta to the south- 
ern tip of Lake Torrens. Then the 
one expensive item would come, 
a level difference of 120 feet; the 
water would have to be pumped 
to that elevation to flow into

GALAXY 






1^ earney sat up in Orestes’ bow, 
one eye on his net, the other 
on the stars. He was a big kid 
with quiet eyes, Hard arms and 
the knack. The fishing boat rock- 
ed beneath him as fishing boats 
have done for millennia, but with’ 
differences. For the tang of fish 
in salt air was substituted for the 
thin reek of warm insulation; for 
the lap of waves and gull cries 
there was the white star-hiss of 
quiet headphones and the sixty- 
cycle hum of machinery. 

The ship herself was as homely 
as her task, a symmetrical cu- 
cumber all lumpy with warts. 
Each of these carried a net and its 
netman, except one large blister 
on the port side that was the 
bridge. Orestes dragged her skein 
through space behind her, flap- 



ping empty since they’d so far 
caught nothing. 

The net that Kearney plied so 
skillfully was a strange thing; a 
ribbon of light that wasn’t light 
at all, but the shimmering bound- 
ary between present and future. 
For Orestes was a time trawler. 
She fished thirty gigayears into 
the future for raw materials to 
feed the hungry galaxy of the 
present. 

Kearney hadn’t had netwatcH 
by himself until this trip; he’d 
just recently been qualified. But 
only the rulebook had held him 
back this long because, as every- 
one knew, he had the knack. 
Something behind those dark eyes 
could read the stars. Computers 
were all right for the ordinary 
netman, but nothing beat the 



137 



knack if you had it, and Kearney 
Had it in spades. 

How did he know where a star 
was going to be in thirty billion 
years? Or more exactly thirty one 
point 976,034,762, which’ was their 
present trawling depth? Well, he 
looked at them, talked to them a 
little. In a way he wooed them, 
loved them, asked them where 
they were going and couldn’t he 
come along? After sitting there an 
hour or two, watching their slow, 
syncopated dance, he got an idea 
of things. Gavotte, twist, some- 
times a just free ballet, all for 
grace. Kearney followed the 
dance. 

Old ones went nova, and h'e 
knew there’d be a space there 
pretty soon, deep in time or shal- 
lower, depending on their size. 
So they wouldn’t pull their lit- 
tle trains of followers or get in the 
way of others, after a while. 

Kearney could even pick out 
those which danced awkwardly, 
encumbered by a system of plan- 
ets, an even more valuable part 
of his knack. The trawlers called 
these the big ones, because the 
smallest planet was worth more 
commercially than the largest 
sun. 

I t’s hard to tell if Kearney 
thought of the stars as 
stars. It’s more likely he re- 
garded them as birds or ghosts. 
Bodecs, down in centcomm, said 
138 



he sometimes heard the kid hum- 
ming to himself, talking to them, 
even answering, “Hey little job- 
ber, where the hell have you 
been?’’ and stuff like that. He 
said, “Yes,” a lot too, which was 
weirder still. 

But whatever Bodecs or the 
rest of them thought, they kept it 
to themselves, even the skipper. 
Kearney had the knack, and that 
was enough. They’d go home with 
a fat catch because of it. It was 
only a matter of time before the 
kid tracked down a biggy and 
earned them all a bonus. 

So Kearney sat up in the bow 
bubble and talked to the stars. 
He spun his nets down in the fu- 
ture and sang to himself. He 
knew where they’d be, the biggies, 
and he systematically avoided 
them. Nobody knew that, of 
course. 

His problem, if you want to 
call it that, was scruples. Big ones 
were valuable because of their 
planets. While the raw energy of 
stars had to be processed down 
to matter, planets were matter to 
begin with. The processing was 
ten times easier and cheaper, so 
the trawlers got ten times the 
normal price for them at Port 
Pluto. But planets often had the 
unsettling prop>erty of support- 
ing life, and processing them 
down to raw materials was a lit- 
tle rough on the natives. Which 
turned Kearney completely off. 

GALAXY 




It would only Have been a mat- 
ter of time before his otherwise 
bountiful net would become con- 
spicuous for its lack of big ones; 
but that time never came because 
something else happened first. 

Kearney was probing when he 
felt the vibes. 

He locked on. Something down 
there. To centcomm he said, “Bo- 
decs? Hey Bodecs, I’ve got some- 
thing. Little but heavy.’’ 

“Need help?’’ 

“No, my net’ll take it. But 
wake up the winch' crew.” 

Seen from a few miles off, the 
Orestes netlifting operations were 
slow and unspectacular. A few 
lights went on, making odd 
blotches beneath her translucent 
skin. All the other nets flickered 
off so as not to foul Kearney’s, 
and to leave more power for the 
winch. Keamesr’s beam grew more 
intense, and the veins of blue be- 
gan to writhe in its milky light. 
The fishing ship herself swung 
around to tug the net in along the 
line of her keel. For almost an 
hour, nothing else happened. 
They towed their catch up 
through the thirty-billion-year 
quarantined layer. 

The reason for the layer was 
obvious. You didn’t want to de- 
plete the near future to feed the 
present. You might end up hurt- 
ing yourself, in a sense killing 
your grandson so that your son 
could be bom. 

THE TIME TRAWLERS 



The layer was more than an 
inconvenience, since the deepest 
a good net would go was only 
thirty-two gigayears. So fisher- 
men were restricted to skimming 
a very thin layer of the future, 
which made for maximum work 
and competition, minimum prof- 
it. 

T Tp it came, Kearney’s catch. It 
bobbed into the visible por- 
tion of his netbeam and stayed 
there, shimmering. It was a star- 
ship. 

Kearney let out his breath un- 
til there was no more air and 
then wnmg his lungs out even 
further. He’d done it; he’d put 
the Orestes on the track of a big- 
gy. The mother system of that lit- 
tle round ship was lying down on 
the bottom somewhere nearby. He 
sat there and quietly hated him- 
self. In his earphones, there was 
jubilation. The skipper told Kear- 
ney to swing his catch back along 
their ship to where the grappling 
beams could stuff it into the 
skein, and he did what he was 
told. Even as he wor'ked, half a 
dozen netbeams swept downtime 
near where his prize had emerged. 

They got it Six fat nets lock- 
ed on, intensified, veined and 
pulled. In the earphones came a 
babble of orders and cheers and 
a mild congratulation from the 
skipper himself. Well done! Then 
more orders. It would take time. 

139 




It was a Sol-sized star witH four 
planets. One was a neo-Venus, ob- 
viously tKe home ®f the starsHip. 
Some one calculated that sKe’d 
bring a tKree-thou bonus to every 
man aboard. Hey-y-y’s came in a 
chorus, with i^ore verbal pats on 
the back for Kearney. 

Kearney switched off His net, 
slumped in the bubble and ran 
thougHtful fingers through his ad- 
olescent beard. Then, moving 
slowly so as not to draw a con- 
spicuous amount of power. He 
swivelled His netgun’s focus to the 
throat of the busy nets outside. 
He fingered power mode to repul- 
sion, and waited. It would wreck 
six beam generators, maybe the 
ship, cost a million solars and his 
own life — but baby, that was go- 
ing to be the big one that got 
away. 

As the edge of their neo-Sol 
broke surface, Kearney triggered 
his netbeam and gave the power 
knob a vicious twist. His beam 
flared for a fraction of a second 
and went out. He’d overdone it, 
and the circuit breaker had 
blown. Even so, the six-beam net 
that mesHed around the big one 
grew duller, then brighter in a se- 
ries of power oscillations that 
rocked the Orestes. Bedlam 
sounded in the pHones. 

“What was that? . Damned 
if I know . Do you suppose the 
natives . Naww . power 
failure? . Engine room, how’s 
140 



the secondary? . Foxir-oK, Skip- 
per, I swear it. There was this 
big surge and . .” 

Qo nobody knew. Kearney was 
prepared to blow His skin for 
success, but not failure. He swung 
his netbeam back to where it be- 
longed, moded for normal power, 
reset the breaker, and left the 
bubble. 

TKe passageways were dark, 
all power going to the nets. He 
fumbled along, aided only by his 
pocket torch, found the crew’s 
wardroom,- and drew some blacko. 
The first cup shook in bis 
hand. The second didn’t, and he 
could think again. He’d been fool- 
ish to think they wouldn’t find 
out. A reran of the engineering 
logs — after they were done with 
the hectic routine of reeling in the 
nets — would surely give him 
away. 

It didn’t even take that long. 
The wardroom was a large space 
and, except for Kearney, empty. 
It echoed when the PA went on 
and the skipper’s voice boomed, 
“Netman Joseph Kearney, to my 
cabin, on the double.” 

The skipper’s cabin was a 
square room with hologram mu- 
rals of Tennessee hills on two 
walls. It was brightly lit even 
now, well furnished, greenly car- 
peted, and the oxygen was at full 
earth pressure, not the gaspy 
eighteen-six of the crew’s quarters. 

GALAXY 




Except for the furious little man 
belund the desk, it was a very 
nice place indeed. Skipper Mack- 
lin had a strip of logtape in lus 
hand, and he shook it in Kear- 
ney’s face. 

“Just whatJn hell is this all 
about?" 

“I tried to cut the nets.” 

Macklin’s jaw dropped, then 
shut to form a wince that came 
with lemon sucking. “Why?” 

“The natives.” 

“I don’t believe itl” There was 
a long pause, ending with a sigh. 
“Yes, I do. Damn shame, too. 
You were good.” Macklin stared 
disgustedly up at him, then got 
to his feet. 

“Okay, out. If I see that baby 
face of yours for the rest of the 
cruise. I’ll put a foot in it. Stay 
off the nets, you’re through.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“And Kearney.” 

“Yes?” 

“You’re lucky you’re such a 
kid. Otherwise, I’d kill you.” 

eamey reeled back to crew’s 
quarters in a daze. For per- 
haps twenty minutes he felt 
lucky to be alive. But for the 
rest of the cruise he felt rotten, 
and they were out the full four 
months. 

He spent a lot of time staring 
out the stem bubble at the skein. 
Though they caught several 
planetoids and one neo-Uranus- 
THE TIME TRAWLERS 



sized free planet, Kearney’s biggy 
dwarfed them all, tugging the 
skeinbeams tight around her. 
There was even a little fear on 
board that she’d burst the skein, 
which was tantamount to having 
a fusion bomb go off on the back 
porch. But it held. 

The big one had been netted up 
intact, with even her rotation and 
energy balance preserved. It was 
likely the natives were still alive, 
possibly even imaware that they 
traveled in a temporal pocket 
thirty billion years in the past. 

Kearney gazed on. Men had 
overrun the galaxy or there would 
not have been any time trawlers 
in the first place. Quadrillions of 
human beings scattered among 
the near stars, running out of 
food, metal, ever3dhing. The fu- 
ture opened before them like a 
tantalizing cornucopia. If the nets 
reached deeper, they could catch 
enough other material to toss 
back the big ones. But as it stood, 
the planets were altogether nec- 
essary, even inhabited ones. 

That was the problem, and there 
wasn’t any answer. When the 
Orestes finally anchored half a 
dozen parsecs off Port Pluto, 
Kearney went below arid stayed. 
He didn’t want to see the pro- 
cessing. He didn’t want to see the 
awful explosion when Orestes 
dropped her shield and the neo- 
Venus found herself thirty giga- 
years displaced in time. Her sun 

141 




slowly going out, her orbit waver- 
ing, her floods, her freezing, her 
loss of air. But most of all, Kear- 
ney didn’t want to see the planet 
rent and ground to elements by 
the mining beams, or the endless 
line of space trucks that bore 
off the fragments like titanic 
hearses. 

It was about this time that 
Kearney had a th'ough'L It 
was a good thought, and he de- 
cided to devote the rest of his life 
to it. 

TTe’d aged twenty years. The 
beard was fuller, the hair on 
his head thinner. Kearney still 
carried himself well, and though 
the springy grace of youth had 
gone, it had been replaced by the 
ponderous strength of a shot-put- 
ter. What few friends he had ad- 
mired him. 

But at thirty-eight Kearney 
had very few friends indeed. It 
was bad enough' to trawl for a 
living, but he seemed to trawl 
for pleasure as well. He hadn’t 
seen earth for six years, and only 
went into Port Pluto to sell his 
fish. Kearney was a loner. 

After old Macklin had fired 
him, things had been difficult. 
He’d been blackballed. Fortun- 
ately the reputation of his knack 
went along with his reputation 
as a maverick, and commercial 
fishermen were a practical lot. He 
found work. In the course of four 
142 



years on the boats out of Pluto 
he’d only turned up one more 
biggy. Lots of asteroids and suns, 
but only one biggy. 

Then He’d bought his own boat, 
a leaky old smack with Her name 
stenciled on the stem: Limpet. 
Somewhere along the line a 
crank had switched the final ‘t’ 
to an ‘r,’ and none of her long 
string of owners had since seen 
fit to change it. 

It was then that Kearney began 
his project. Alone on the Limper, 
he changed his tactics from avoid- 
ing the big ones to seeking them 
out With his knack it wasn’t dif- 
ficult, either; He cotild have been 
a rich man. Yet the wholesalers to 
whom Kearney sold his catch had 
yet to record his bringing in a big 
one. 

The biggy kicking in his nets 
right now was his fortieth. As he 
locked in the winch beams, Kear- 
ney hummed in self-congratula- 
tion: forty in sixteen years. Leav- 
ing the Limper to finish hauling 
in by Herself, he crawled out of 
the bubble and into his cramped 
combined bridge and cabin. 

Out came the thick notebook, 
of which thirty-nine pages were 
littered with notes, dates, calcula- 
tions. It was quite like an anthro- 
pologist’s fieldbook: thirty fami- 
lies of monkeys in their wld habi- 
tats. Discovered at different 
times. Habits noted. Notes of Jat- 
er visits. Each family had been 

GALAXY 




given a toy — or was it a tool? 
— (Ml an early visit, and tlieir use 
of it observed on subsequent 
dates. TKere were gigayears be- 
tween observations, sometimes. 
Some pages Had stars, some x’s, 
at least fifteen were crossed out 
blackly, failures for one reason or 
anotKer. Nine were blank because 
tHere Had been no monkeys at all. 

Kearney flipped to a blank 
page and put (40) in tHe upper 
left corner. THen: 

Big one Forty. Spatial location 
790 X 328 X 237 Temporal loca- 
tion: September 11, 3181 — plus 
31.089,468,973, 

THen He dropped tHe pen into 
the crotcH of the binding to mark 
His place and went over to the 
locker. He got out his diving suit, 
tKen sat down where He could see 
tHe netbeam reeling its catcH up 
tHrougK tHe millennia, and waited. 

Tt bobbed to tHe surface an hour 
later: small, HigH intensity sun 
ringed by no less tHan seventeen 
planets. He took readings and im- 
mediately wrote off tHe first six 
and tHe last four as uninKabita- 
ble. Of the middle seven, tHe fiftH 
looked most inviting, and he de- 
cided to hit Her first. Kearney 
went aft to where the diving sled 
rested in her davits, sealed his 
Helmet and shut the pressure lock 
behind him. A few minutes later 
tHe port opened and he aimed the 
little skiff out into space. 

THE TIME TRAWLERS 



THere was a saying that old 
sailors got used to the sensation 
of time-diving, and Kearney was 
an old sailor. Going from die 
near-perfect vacuum of space, 
througH tHe side of tHe netbeam 
and into the absolute vacuum of 
non-time was Hardly noticeable 
at first. But after thirty or forty 
seconds inside, your nose and 
kneecaps began to wander all 
over your body. A torrent of 
false sensations played over 
you like colors running tHrougH 
an acid Head. Two minutes of it 
would Have been unbearable, but 
it was usually all over in one, 
Kearney Had long since found out 
that old sailors were liars. 

He filtered back into real — 
altHougH future — time and 
found Himself orbiting Forty’s sun 
in rougfily tHe same orbit as Her 
fiftH planet. He wheeled tHe sled 
into tHe smaller body’s gravity 
well and let her pull it down, sav- 
ing i>ower, another trick only a 
man witH a knack would dare. 
As he broke througH the clouds 
and got his first good look, it was 
obvious that he’d guessed cor- 
rectly. 

Forty-dash-Five was a water- 
world, the driest areas just sandy 
marshes full of brilliantly blue 
weeds. With a symmetry that 
only intelligence could produce, 
canals mazed through them. Tet- 
rahedral domes of jelly lined the 
canals. 



143 




Kearney picked the largest 
dome in view and landed next to 
it. Inside, four heads each with an 
eye and nine arms, stared hos- 
tilely out at him . Each arm Held 
a spear. Kearney fought the urge 
to vomit, deciding then and there 
that he’d made no attempt to 
communicate. 

He put the wheel and crossbow, 
plus a dozen other mindbenders 
into the hatch and ejected them. 
Next, a barrel-sized sphere of 
stainless steel went out. In it was 
a world of information — includ- 
ing his own biography and a 
promise to return. 

When he took off again, some 
two dozen spears glanced off his 
hull. If he came back in a hun- 
dred years they’d be bullets. He 
hoped. But judging by their pres- 
ent state of evolution. He made a 
mental note to hold off for at 
least a few hundred thousand. 

Kearney found life on none of 
the other six planets. About aver- 
age, he sighed. Quite tired now, 
he Headed back toward the apex 
of the net beam, and Limper. The 
last thing He did before turning in 
was to set up a rep shield around 
Forty. 

A few months later, Kearney 
headed into Port Pluto to 
drop His catch and pick up some 
fuel and supplies. The Limper 
towed laboriously at her skeinful 
of fish. Actually, she didn’t tow 
144 



them: her skeinbeams displaced 
their spatial coordinates of the 
future with those of the present. 
But this took energy — of which 
Limper had little — and she 
moved slowly. 

Kearney anchored out at tiie 
processing station and cut the 
skein field. The displaced Hydro- 
gen of real space parted with a 
bang to accept two suns and an 
asteroid out of the future, and for 
a few seconds the fireworks were 
quite impressive. The wholesaler 
Androsias cheated him as usual, 
and as usual Kearney didn’t stop 
to haggle. He left Limper at the 
piers and' took a shuttle into 
Pluto. He needed supplies, and a 
night off. 

The city was built on the in- 
side surface of the Hollowed-out 
planet. She was spun by external 
means — ion beams up on Her 
frozen outside surface — and cen- 
trifugal force kept things attached 
to the inside shell with about half 
their normal weight. In essence it 
was an inside-out little place, 
quite unsettling until you got 
used to looking up and seeing 
down on the other side of the 
world, beyond the bluish artificial 
sun that was hung right in the 
middle by guywires. 

Like most of the other build- 
ings there, Pulaski’s Bar was a 
hole in the ground. Kearney de- 
scended the widening spiral of 
steps that ran down the cone- 

GALAXY 




shaped walls from above, then 
walked across thirty feet of flat 
floor to the circular bar in the 
middle. 

Pulaski was alone. When he 
glanced out from under his holo- 
glasses he merely said. “Oh, 
howsa.” 

“Okay. What’s on?’’ 

“Nothin’ much. News.” He took 
off the glasses, blinked. “An- 
verse?” 

“If it’s fresh.” It wasn’t, but 
Kearney sipped the murky eu- 
phoric and stared into the holo- 
murals. Pulaski put his glasses 
back on and returned to his 
slouch against the back of the 
bar. The Alps and the Pacific 
were superimposed to give old 
earth a grander scene than she 
was ever mother of; that was one 
segment of the mural. On the 
other was a scene from the docks 
of New Orleans, circa 1890. Wher- 
ever did they dig these up. The 
Anverse began its work, and 
Kearney built a lifedream around 
the high-breasted crinoline crea- 
ture in the foreground. 

/Customers came and went, one 
or two at a time, but Kearney 
dreamed on. He had a second 
glass and considered redreaming 
the same thing with' slight 
changes, decided against it and 
ordered an anti. He was almost 
unbent again when Bobby Mack- 
lin and his crew rolled in. They 
THE TIME TRAWLERS 



weren’t on anverse. Alky and 
plenty of it was wHat tfiey order- 
ed, and obviously Bad been order- 
ing for some time. 

Bobby Macklin was Skipper 
Macklin’s son. WBen tBe old skip-

Kearney knew tBe man sligBtly 
and avoided Him. It was not out 
of malice to tBe fatEer, eitHer, but 
simply because tBe son was an 
unpleasant sort, not wortH tfie 
time. 

Bobby, However, avoided no 
one. Peering across Pulaski’s tbm 
sHoulder, He muttered a question 
tHickly to one of His mates. THen, 
eyes widening. He answered tHe 
question Himself. “Damn! It’s 
Himl” Tfie flesfiy finger pointed, 
and Kearney found Himself look- 
ing into four pairs of sligfitly in- 
credulous but very Hostile eyes. 
As a man, tHe quartet got up and 
came around to take seats beside 
Him. 

“Hello, Bobby.” 

Tfiick Hand on His sHoulder, 
tHick breatH in His face. “WHy, 
Hi tfiere old buddy. How’s tHe 
sabotaging business, tfiese days?” 
Feeling Kearney’s muscles tigfit-

moved it quickly, sat up, went on 
in a louder voice. “Guess wHat tfie

"I couldn’t.” 

“Well, we found a little old ra-

Murmurs, nods, leers. Two cus-

Yes, it Had been one of the 
forty, Kearney decided. “You 
fouled your nets?” He said, drop- 
ping His foot from the rung of tHe 
barstool to tHe floor. 

“Fouled?” the gross man shout- 
ed. “Fouled? Burnt to a crisp!

ship, punctured two lazarettes. 
And I said, that’s just like Kear- 
ney. He did it to my old man and 
He’d do it to anyone. Sabotaging 
a buoy. A repulsor shield, a god- 
damn repulsor shield!”

Keamey rose to His feet, Eis 
chin inches from Bobby’s up- 
raised face. “People wfio don’t 
steal don’t get into trouble.” Bob- 
by Had His back to the bar, and 
Keamey pressed Him against it 
li^tly with tHe palm of Es ri^t 
Hand, cHucked Him mockingly 
under tHe chin witH tfie other. 
THe fat man’s cHeeks went as red 
as his eyes and He was literally 
speechless. THe pulpy mouth 
opened and for a second all that 
came out was a stammering hiss. 
But it ended. “Get Him!” 

Kearney pushed Hard, sending 
Bobby careening over the bar. At 
the same time. He swung His Head 
down and to the left, pivoting 
out of the clinch on his left foot. 
A bottle and tHe edge of a knuck- 
ly hand whistled through the air 
where his Head Had been and 
crashed on the table. 

But the third of Macklin’s net- 
men stayed with him, and before 
Kearney could straighten up from 
the dodge He felt hands in his 
beard and saw a knee coming up 
toward his face. All he Had time 
to do was turn his Head, and the 
sledgehammer Hit his ear. He ex- 
ploded backward from the force 
of it, so hard that His opponent 
was left holding two handfuls of 
whiskers. 

Pain brings fury to some men. 
One must be careful when beating

ately, imparts maximum pain,

Kearney got back on his feet, he 
was so incensed he wasn’t even 
human. 

He was back at Es antagonist 
in one step. Planting His left foot. 
He executed a perfect pimt on the 
other’s cEn with tHe rigHf. It 
made a messy soimd and 1^ the 
man with loose gravel for teeth. 

THe first two were rigHt be- 
Hind, and one grabbed Kearney’s 
foot, twisted and Heaved. Keamey 
cartwheeled across the room and 
smashed into the wall. Half a 
breath later, Bobb^s man came 
at Him head down in a ram rush 
designed to spread Kearnej^s 
guts all over the flint glass mural 
screen. Kearney sidestepped. 
Bash I THe man groaned when He 
hit; but, just to make sure, Kear- 
ney chopped twice at the thick 
neck before He hit the floor. 

'^here was one left. Kearney 
came at him in a storm of 
knuckles. The man made a High 
sound in the back of His tEoat 
and fled. Keamey chased Em 
halfway up the stairs, ran out of 
breath, and came dizzily down. 
He’d had it; that first headblow 
was getting to Him. 

Pulaski’s Hands appeared over 
the edge of the bar, followed by 
the upper Half of Es apprehensive 
face, a perfect Kilroy. Then they 
disappeared and when He re- 

147 




emerged, Pulaski was hauling a 
still windknocked Bobby Mack- 
lia to his feet. 

“You broke four bottles,” lie 
said accusingly to Kearney, point- 
ing to a mess of stains and bro- 
ken glass on Bdbby’s backside. 

“I’ll pay. Got any water?” He 
dragged Bobby back on the cus- 
tmner’s side of the bar and prop- 
ped him up on a stool. Kearney 
took a long gulp from the glass 
Pulaski offered and threw the rest 
in Bobby’s face. 

“So you raided my buoy. 
What’d you do with the fish?” 

“Nothing, we couldn’t bring 
her in.” 

“You know what I’d Have done 
if y»u had?” Kearney rapped Him 
ungently on the windpipe. 

“I can guess,” he wheezed. 

Kearney fought an urge to beat 
the man sjrstematically to jelly. 
But he went over and retrieved 
what was left of his torn jacket 
from where it had come off near 
the wall. Then he paid Pulaski 
and went out. 

Forty minutes later, Kearney 
Bad ordered a shuttle load of sup- 
plies and was on his way out to 
the Limper. No telling what Bob- 
by had done to biggy Eleven 
Vhen he’d dropped his nets on it. 
Wailing in protest at the throttle 
Kearney fed her, Limper was on 
Her way to the Grand Banks 
within the hour. 

Not surprisingly, the buoy had 
148 



been destroyed, but there was 
considerable debris floating near- 
by to mark the place. Kearney 
grinned. He anchored and reached 
down the notebook. 

Inhabited system Eleven. Spa- 
tial location 473 x 492 x 845. Tem- 
poral location; August 14, 3169

axy. One planet, two satellites,

quarter gigayear for development, 
and they should be ready. 

eamey made another entry 
describing Bobby’s raid. 
Then he coded off the rep shield 
that had saved his fish from Bob- 
by and went about trawling for 
her himself. In two hours he was 
in the sled, riding his terminal 
orbit around Eleven-dash-one. 

Although the last time he’d 
been there was by local reckoning 
three hundred million years ear- 
lier, most of the landscape was 
fairly familiar. By landscape one 
meant topography; the scenery it- 
self was vastly different. Eleven- 
one had gone from prehistoric 
ferns to solid city. She was just 
as crowded as the planets of 
Kearney’s own time. 

The largest city in view had a 
peculiar geometry. Some power- 

GALAXY 




ful planner had laid a mile-broad 
letter K on the coimtryside and 
built his roads to suit it. True, 
the interplaited cross streets were 
rarely symmetrical, but it had a 
certain beauty. Kearney felt god- 
like. At the intersection of the K 
was a park, wide green, water- 
laced. A swamp, in fact. He drift- 
ed the sled for it. Hit somewhere 
near the middle. 

The woman — or so he judged 
her — who met him was greenish 
and reptilian, but rather pretty. 
Six or seven newts clustered fear- 
fully around her as Kearney’s 
sled settled into the tall grass, 
not twenty yards from their pic- 
nic table. Kearney stepped out, 
prepared to go through the take- 
me-to-your-leudcr bit; but she 
shortstopped the whole thing 
with four words. 

“By Kearney,” she whispered, 
“It’s Kearney.” 

The ride through town to Su- 
per’s palace gave him a chance 
to see what he’d wrought. Obvi- 
ously he’d induced terrestrial evo- 
lution on what was basically an 
aquatic species, but they seemed 
none the worse for it. Doorknobs 
for webbed hands were the size 
of footballs and softly textured. 
Perambulators for newtlets were 
water filled. But everyone had the 
look of well-being that only a 
sophisticated use of science and 
democratic philosophy could 
bring about. So somehow he felt 
THE TIME TRAWLERS 



he hadn’t left them too bad a leg- 
acy, three gigs earlier. 

Quper had the tall careful awk- 
^ wardness of a Lincoln. He 
was worn-scaled and gray-green, 
the lighter shade apparently ow- 
ing to age. And like the rest of 
them, his completely smooth body 
gave no reason for him to have 
been other than unclad. Behind 
his wide wooden desk lay the shell 
of a seed Kearney had shown 
three gigayears earlier. 

“Kearney. So you’re not a leg- 
end after all.” 

“Oh, I’m real.” 

“Well, thanks for this,” Super 
said, waving a webbed hand at 
the steel capsule. “We’ve used it 
all. We’ve even got time trawlers 
of our own, now.” 

“You’re welcome. Ready to pay 
for it?” 

Super looked startled. “Pay?” 

“Look, I came across your sys- 
tem by time trawling myself. You 
could*easily have been reeled back 
to my own time and reduced to 
raw materials. As a matter of fact 
you still can.” 

Moisture glistened around Su- 
per’s gill slits. “Extortion, Kear- 
ney?” 

“Mildly, yes. I want a promise. 
Now you’re time trawling your- 
self. You have the same power 
over future systems that I’ve had 
over you. I want you to promise 
to treat them as I’ve treated you.

la odier words, tGrow back tKe 
big ones. And educate tfaem.” 
Super looked' relieved. 

“la addition,” Kearney be- 
gan — 

Sunlight tHrougS tHe tall win- 
dow faded, gr^ to double bril- 
liance, then settled back to nor- 
mal. Super cried, “WKat?” Kear- 
ney, smacking His forehead with 
a palm, said, “Murder! It must be 
Bobby.” 

A fter Kearney Had left him in 
tfie debris of Pulaski’s bottles 
and His own crewmen, Bobby 
Macklin was a frightened man. 
But back on His own ship he got 
braver. Orestes was twenty times 
the size of Limper, and could eat 
the little ship and spit out the 
bones before Kearney knew what 
hit him. That was Bobby’s plan. 
He was quite sure Kearney would 
go out to that pet biggy of his 
and check on things. So, not two 
hours after Kearney left, Bobby 
was hot behind him. 

“I’ve got him on visual. Skip- 
per. Looks like He’s got that biggy 
up the surface.” 

“Good, he’s saved us the trou- 
ble. Anchor, and get him on the 
Y band. Bobby settled contented- 
ly back in the skipper’s couch and 
leered out the port at Keame3r*s 
defenseless ship. 

“Can’t raise him — oh, wait, 
his autopilot’s putting out a Stan- 
dard Three. He’s left the ship and 
150 



gone diving down in the biggy.” 
Bobby grinnecL “And that’s 
where he’ll stay. Send a crew over 
and transfer the fish from his net 
to ours. And have them bring 
back his diving phone. I want to 
say good-bye to dear old Kear- 
ney.” 

D own on Eleven-one, Kearney 
and Super sat in the latter’s 
office. 

“You’re sure he’ll call?” the 
green man asked. 

“Yes, soon. It’d be his style to 
gloat. The blink in the sunlight 
was caused by his shifting us from 
one net to the other. Which' 
means — ” 

“Which means, if I may quote, 
we’re in the fire.” 

“Where’d you get that expres- 
sion?” 

“From the same encyclopedia 
that you both blessed and bur- 
dened us with willy-nilly three 
gigs ago.” 

“Come on. Super. Until now 
you were grateful.” 

“Until now. Agreed, you’re the 
best of your type, Kearney; but 
men are a race of exploiters, pure 
and simple. Your friend would 
just as soon process us as — ” 
“My what? Now look, I have 
told you how this was supposed 
to work out Bobby’s just — ” 
“Hey, Kearney,” tinned a voice 
inside His helmet 
“Yeah, Bobby, hello.” 



GALAXY 




“Got you now, baby.” TKere 
was a nasty snicker. “When they 
tun you through the processor 
you’ll probably come out looking 
like — ” 

“Okay, okay. Look, I want to 
buy my way out.” 

“With what? I’ve already got 
your ship. And this biggy.” 

“Peanuts. I can give you twice 
that.” 

“From where?” 

“Let me up, and I’ll tell you.” 

The snicker expanded to a 
laugh. “Squirm, baby. You’re 
never getting out.” Bobby click- 
ed off. 

“What now?” Super asked 
hopelessly. Even as they spoke 
the sun blinked again, indicating 
that their captor had shifted them 
to his skein. 

Kearney shrugged. “We’ve got 
— let’s see — probably ten of 
your days to come up with some- 
thing.” 

TJobby Macklin called down in- 
to the skein in hopes of pull- 
ing a few more legs off his flies, 
but the flies wouldn’t give him 
that satisfaction. He had the 
growing suspicion that something 
was brewing down there, and so 
he had ordered Orestes back to 
Port Pluto as fast as she could 
tow her load. The sooner he’d re- 
duced Kearney to a handful of 
minerals, the better. But he wasn’t 
quick enough. They were still four 
THE TIME TRAWLERS 



days off Pluto when his after 
netman called in. 

“Skipper, there’s something go- 
ing on out in the skein.” 

Macklin rushed aft and peered 
out the stem btibble. There cer- 
tainly was something going on. 
The sack of woven energy 
squirmed like the belly of a preg- 
nant mare. It became bloated. 
Through its translucent walls 
Bobby and his crew saw not only 
one big one with Her planet and 
moons, but four other stars. 

“Quick, try and get Kearney.” 
He was handed the phone. “Hey, 
Kearney, what gives?” 

“Your skein, if you don't drop 
us.” 

“Where’re you getting . .” 
“The future, our future. Sixty - 
five gigs from you. Listen, fat- 
head, drop us or else. You know 
what a burst skein’ll do to your 
ship.” 

“Yeah, louse,” He clicked off. 
“Cut the skein. He’s got us.” 
The beams flickered out, and 
Kearney, Super biggy Eleven’s 
entire system and baggage drop- 
ped down through the eons to its 
own time. 

Bobby Macklin rebuilt the 
skein, then headed disgustedly 
back to the Grand Banks for four 
months of fishing, legitimate, this 
time. Consequently, when h'e re- 
turned to Port Pluto he found 
himself one of the last to hear. 

Kearney had headed for Port 
152 



Pluto as soon as he’d gotten back 
to his ship. He’d gone to Galcoun- 
cil with a weird looking alien in 
tow, and made his pitch. 

Tt was quite simple. What one 
did was throw back the big 
ones and teach them to time 
trawl themselves. For this the 
fishermen received two percent of 
the big one’s own catch. 

In a sense. Super had been 
right. Kearney’s was a race of ex- 
ploiters. But it took an honestly 
humane man l^ke Kearney to 
dream up a cycle of exploitation 
where nobody lost. Under his plan 
the future did indeed open like an 
infinite cornucopia — of both raw 
materials and manpower — a 
huge cone whose base lay gigagi- 
gayears in the future. Each layer 
had only to go out and educate 
the next, then take their nominal 
two percent. But two percent of 
infinity is infinity, and each layer 
had more than enough support- 
ers on the next to sustain it. Not 
only was it infinitely easier all 
around, but no big ones would 
ever have to be processed. 

Bobby Macklin, returning from 
his four-month cruise, was among 
the last to know. The law had 
been in effect just about three 
days when he brought in the 
catch of his career and had it 
processed. A big one, his first and 
his last. Anyone’s last.

/^h, gang, he’s back! Back from

ever, and a gladsome sight he is. 
Ageless, very cool . well, no; I 
was never that. Flash was — 
Flash Gordon, star of Flash Gor- 
don by Alex Raymond, a huge, 
wonderful picture book made of 
the old Sunday newspaper series 
by Nostalgia Press, Box 293, 



153 



Franklin Square, New York 
11010. But it's me tKafs back. 
The return one celebrates with' a 
book like this is one’s own. There 
I am, with the sno^ell of cheap ink 
and Sunday afternoon carpet in 
my noslails. 

(Hell, I know there’s a Flash 
Gordon still. I even know some of 
the people who’ve worked on him 
in recent years. I know their opin- 
ions, their voices, the color of 
their neckties, for God’s sake. 
Quick — what color was Alex 
Raymond’s necktie?) 

But I’m assuming too much. 
Some of you may need updating 

Yes, Klaus, there really was a 
Flash Gordon, Yale graduate and 
world-renowned polo player, and 
he did pit himself against Ming 
the Merciless upon the planet 
Mongo, to which he had flown in 
the experimental rocket ship of 
the megalomaniacal Dr. Hans 
Zarkov, foremost scientific figure 
of the 1930’s. With him. Dale Ar- 
den, in a dumb red hat The pres- 
ent-day imposter, with’ his doe 
eyes and tapering fingers, is a 
present-day imposter. 

There on Mongo — where Zar- 
kov*s brain cleared, and the draw- 
ing improved, too — the mighty 
Flash encountered the damned- 
est technological political situa- 
tion ever made believable by 
mortal man. A giant electric oc- 
topod terrorized the free and in- 
dependent polar kingdom of the 
154 



proud Fria, queen of Frigia, sexy 
blonde, commander of the pano- 
plyed snowbird lancers, mistress 
of a medieval palace to wHic^' 
one traveled either by sled or 
rocketship, and stubborn holdout 
against the otherwise all-encom- 
passing rule of the mighty Ming. 

Traitors by the dozens menace 
the tranquility of Arborea, an ur- 
ban civilization of bow-bearing 
freemen ensconsed in the gigantic 
trees of what appears to be Mon- 
go’s Pacific Northwest, where 
Prince Barin and the Princess 
Aura hold out stubbornly against 
the otherwise all-encompassing 
rule of Ming the magnificent, evil 
genius and absolute ruler of all He 
surveys. 

Underfoot, the powermen pad 
on rubber boots, wealing airplane 
goggles, hating Ming,^ fixing his 
wiring and waiting for an Earth- 
man to come along and point out 
that they do, literally, hold the 
power. 

Yes sir. And all girls wear 
clothes you can see through. 

Oh, yes, sir! 

A lex Raymond is a long time 
dead. He went off to World 
War II, and clods fell not on His 
grave but on his work. When he 
came back, he did some illustra- 
tions for Astounding — not very 
good ones; somewhere. He had 
forgotten something — and then 
he started a crime strip which 

GALAXY 




was very good but lacked snow- 
bird lancers. He crashed a car 
and died. 

But Flash has been waiting 
beck there all these years, along 
with you and me, waiting to be 
rediscovered along with you and 
me. 

Nearly every page of this big 
book is filled with more than 
Rasrmond’s drawing — that effect 
varied, as various people inked 
it, and several panels obviously 
never saw the inside of Ray- 
mond’s brain at all; I wonder 
what happened to the episodes for 
5-12 and 6-30-40, neither of them 
signed. Momentary slips hardly 
matter, though. This book is filled 
with Ra 3 rmond’s marvelous sense 
of story, which transcended mere 
logic and the fruits of reality. It 
struck hard at the wellsprings of 
hope; hope for the little bit of 
hero in all of us, hope that some- 
thing would happen to take us 
out of ourselves and test us, hope 
that what the tests revealed 
would be the envy of man, wom- 
an and child. 

The drawing, by the way, is 
often marvelous. The absence of 
the color, which has been omitted 
from these full-size reprintings, is 
probably an advantage. It was 
clearly also an economic neces- 
sity. Even so, the book costs an 
arm and a leg — $12.50. But I’ve 
done my best to save that bad 
news for last. Surely there is some 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



bank you could rob. I mean, at 
times Raymond very carefully in- 
vented a calligraphy of its own 
for Mongo, and these rather at- 
tractive traceries are occasionally 
shown in billboards or on store 
signs. But when Flash wanted to 
irritate Ming, he grabbed off one 
of his officers, stripped him, and 
sent him back to the Merciless, 
lettered in honest Yale block 
capitals: ON THIS FAT BELLY 
I DO DECLARE THAT MING 
IS A PUNK BEYOND COM- 
PARE. 

Can you pass it up? Come back 
to your Sunday self. 

C ryptozoic, by Brian Aldiss, on 
the other hand, is a novel 
that goes forward to itself, but not 
very well. Its major premise is 
“mind travel,” wdiich is appar- 
ently a kind of time travel one 
gets into by taking a drug and 
adopting an appropriate mental 
attitude. It’s not astral projec- 
tion, or some temporal equivalent 
of it, for the traveler does absent 
himself from the here and now, 
retaining only the most tenuous 
of links with contemporaneity, 
leaving a bit of blood and a gob- 
bet of tissue behind. He can take 
some things with him — dothes, 
a motorbike, a tent, food — even 
though these objects are not 
drugged. He needs to be able to 
take along a kind of machine call- 
ed an "air leaker," or he couldn’t 

155 




breathe in the past . because he 
can’t touch the past. The air 
leaker apparently can, at least 
well enough to somehow grab 
molecules of air and distempor 
them in sufficient concentration 
to keep the travder alive, if not 
ebullient. 

This is all right, because in all 
this book there is not one person 
who enjoys life, makes life bet- 
ter for anyone, says anything 
worth remembering, or accom- 
plishes a clearcut triumph. Which 
is odd, because in this book a 
man proves conclusively that 
time runs exactly in reverse of 
how we think it does; when he 
dies, the very ages mourn at his 
inchrondescent pyre. Another 
man becomes the creator of im- 
mortal works of art. A third man 
overcomes great psychological 
odds in straining very close to 
love. But these occurrences, to- 
ward which the story seems to 
point, or on which it appears to 
pivot, are spoken of, or reported, 
or lectured upon. When shown 
at all, they are shown as if in 
coarse-grained silent black and 
white intrusion on a 1935 Agfa- 
color underground movie about 
desolation. De-soul-ation. The 
sole achin’. The-soul-I-shun . 
You follow me? In weak tints, 
with camera either fixed too long 
or wobblishly hand-held. Crypto- 
zoic sucks on and on and over 
through the same five minutes’ 
156 



worth of mood; when it exerts 
itself to tell us a little bit about 
the England (s) its people started 
from, it can tell us only that they 
are the bleaker the farther into 
the future they get. The hreo is 
less gifted, less emphatic, less fil- 
ial, less likeable — but his girl 
friend is no grubbier — the more 
the world’s calendar advances. 
He is no longer an artist, no long- 
er a lover . not even of his 
mother ... no longer a human 
being as he beats up a man with 
a golf club in an interrogation 
room scene that is to my knowl- 
edge unsurpassed in this field for 
reader uninvolvement. 

Aldiss’s “science” breaks down 
constantly. We deal with a scale 
of unimaginable years — from the 
beginning of the world to the very 
end — and yet in his wanderings 
he occasionally cannot penetrate 
through a past tree, or a palace, 
because “it has been there too 
long” to be insubstantial! He has 
his air leaker, but he is as- 
tonished when the Dark Woman’s 
gang can fire gas guns into their 
past. He and the other mind trav- 
elers are leaving feces stranded 
all over the past, but he doesn’t 
stop to wonder where his exhala- 
tions go, what happens to motor- 
bike exhaust . and he drinks 
“concentrated water.” 

^arp, do I? Hardly. The point 
is, Aldiss hardly cares what 
GALAXY 




patch-up excuse he gives for his 
hero’s doing or not doing the 
things he does in this story. No- 
tion first, and all else second, he 
wants to tell us about isolation, 
degeneration, and all those other 
downhill things. Because he then 
wants to do something else — pull 
off a tour de force chapter in 
which Stein the ein explains our 
pains by pushing the notion that 
time runs contrariwise to oxir per- 
ception of it — that the ugly 
“future” of complication and all 
that other erected structure of 
civilization is in fact behind us, 
and that we are progressing into 
the simple, uncomplex, more tal- 
ented “past” of the history which 
we remember because wHat we 
think of as memory is in fact pre- 
cognition. Our actual memory — 
of what we erroneously call the 
future — is lousy. 

At least, ^ I think this what he 
wanted to do at one stage, for he 
surely went to a great deal of 
trouble to explain why his hero. 
Bush, would want to return to the 
womb. But either because he al- 
ways planned to then confuse us 
further, or because he felt him- 
self slipping sidewise through 
some sort of morass, or because it 
would have been un-good or un- 
cool or un-self to actually come 
right out and make some sort of 
statement, he pulls out in the 
end with some babble about how 
it was all an insane dream. “Each 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



reader must decide for himself” 
what this book is about, says 
Doubleday’s blurb writer, and 
that’s your tipoff. 

This book is a pretty good ex- 
ample of why the “new wave” 
of sf is evocative, often exciting, 
always willing, but also illustra- 
tive of the fact that, nevertlieless, 
it is just as easy as ever to lose 
control of a story. 

There can be no quarrel with 
an attempt to get out of the old 
ruts; the world is chilly, few of 
us are heroes, and not many ide- 
als support much weight. It was 
always so, but perhaps there is 
something more valid for fiction 
to do than simply to inspire. 
Maybe it can, instead, show us 
ways in which we personally can 
cope, without at the same time 
demanding that we give up our 
jobs, tear up our mortages, and 
haunt hilltops, waiting to be pick- 
ed up by talent scouts in flying 
saucers. 

But this is a useless book. It 
tells us that the writer thinks he’s 
clever. It even proves that he is, 
indeed, nationally facile, and per- 
haps admirable for not having 
gone into doing advertising. Real- 
ly, this is what it tells us, when 
all the words are gone by. What 
a pity. 

Tt may be that Keith' Laumer’s 
associations with’ the U.S. dip- 
lomatic corps were quite different 

157 




from mine with another, but I 
have alwa 3 Ts felt the Retief stories, 
no matter how individually good 
— or bad — were fundamentally 
based either on an error of ob- 
servation or an even less com- 
mendable catering to the sup- 
posed preconceptions of the audi- 
ence. So I’ve alwa 3 Ts been cool to 
Retief, and thence to Laumer, be- 
cause for years this was the level 
He appeared to be working at. 

But Earihblood, done with the 
late Rosel Brown, was something 
else again; and so, emphatically, 
is “The Day Before Forever” 
and “Thunderhead” (Doubleday, 
$3.95), which is all Laumer, a 
yard wide, and all very good. 

These are two long stories, of 
which “Day” is far the longer. I 
imagine Laumer also ought to be 
given the credit for refusing to 
blow up a short novel into book 
length. 

“Thunderhead” is an excellent- 
ly told, unexceptionable story 
about a man who does his duty. 
In a way, it’s a surefire yarn — 
the kind that can’t miss. Yet this 
kind of story can be monstrously 
hard to write. The hero is more 
faithful, more persevering, more 
resolute, more staminous than 
you or I could be, and one slip 
by the writer in describing him or 
his ever-increasing problems 
could break the spell and turn 
lum into a figure of pure com. 
Where this kind of story gets its 
158 



necessary tension, as a matter of 
fact, is in balancing the reader’s 
true capabilities against the ac- 
tions of this costume the author 
draws over him for a while. (Put 
seven league boots on . a man, and 
you have to convince him grating 
his bunions is worth it.) Seen in 
that light, what a writer does 
when he does a good job on a 
story like this is more of a feat 
than writing something by your 
own rules. 

However that may seem, 
“Thunderhead” ought to be read 
first, as a counterpoise to “Day”, 
because the latter is a far more 
difficult story. 

U nderneath all the events is the 
action line — the attempt 
of the uninformed, imarmed, to- 
tally alone, partially amnesiac 
hero to make sense out of and 
find room in a future society. It’s 
a society which demonstrates in 
Scene One that you can die here 
like a beef steer without anyone’s 
even wondering about your name 
or all those poignant antecedents 
locked in your memories. Over 
that are the twists; the Hero’s 
multiple identities, the paperchase 
clues, the masked villain, the enig- 
matic ally, the shattering secret 
of the hero’s past. There is noth- 
ing here that Van Vogt hasn’t 
done, just as there is nothing in 
the character that isn’t reminis- 
cent of Heinlein, from dialogue on 

GALAXY 




th'rougli some moments that make 
you think of Beyond This Hori- 
zon quite a lot. And yet there is 
a great deal of Laumer here, 
down where it coimts — in the 
engine compartment. 

The rapid narrative drive of 
this story, the emotional involve- 
ment with the protagonist, and 
the emotional charge of the end- 
ing, are there because Laumer 
plans for them, works to sustain 
them, and begins by bringing to 
them an exact understanding of 
how to make them go. There is 
nothing mysterious about the 
separate elements of this story. 
You get an idea for a situation 
— A does B because He is moti- 
vated to do so by C. This results 
in D, which he doesn’t want, and 
so he now has to think of what 
to do to get E. (You substitute, 
for these various components, 
such things as “A becomes ruler 
of the world because he needs to- 
tal power in order to restore life 
to his dead daughter,” and you’re 
off.) Then you conceal their line- 
arity from the reader — you “spin 
a good yam” — by adopting a 
viewpoint within this framework 
of events, rather than one detach- 
ed outside it Doing that, you im- 
mediately intrigue the reader just 
the amount required to keep him 
wondering what’s going to happen 



next, without either mystifying 
him to the point where he be- 
comes confused and loses inter- 
est, or letting him see ahead and 
become bored. 

Anyone can do it It’s a child’s 
play, as dozens of satirists Have 
proven, which will explain how 
come there are so many, many 
good stories written to ffie com- 
plete satisfaction of the standards 
of performance in this mode. 

No? You say there aren’t many 
many good action stories being 
told any more? That people miss 
a good storyteller so badly that 
they still mourn Alex Raymond 
decades after his death? 

Well, I don’t know. I was much 
younger, once, and things were 
simpler. I thought it would be 
easy. (I still don’t like stories in 
which the easy is made easier by 
coincidence, by dumb luck, by 
auctorial intrusion, by hustling 
extra characters in out of the 
wings, by glossing over the hard 
parts with offstage voices and 
sound effects. I wonder if only 
the action modes are to prove to 
these well-known flaws.) 

And yet there are so few who 
write a story as good as “The 
Day Before Forever.” I don’t 
know. There must be something 
to it after all.

I 

^"T^horinn, son of Goryat, stood 
in the darkness and listened. 
Stone hung heavy over his head, 
leagues of stone and earth, 



stretching upward black and si- 
lent. 

Behind him the sound of the 
cataract down which he had 
floated to this place had receded 
to a dull murmvu, and he could 



161 




Hear the gurgle of lesser streams 
running away somewhere below 
Him. The falling curtains of water 
were all around Kim , gHostly sil- 
ver and silent, pricked witlj tKe 
jewels of floating droplets. Drift- 
ing water-points burst on His lips 
witK tiny cool kisses. 

There were gaps in tKe falling 
curtains, tom by t£e irregular 
stone above. He put His Head 
through the widest of tKese open- 
ings, saw other broken slabs, oth- 
er curtains of water beyond. 

Following the cool air, Ee made 
his way among tKe gray and sil- 
ver curtains tHat Ktmg every- 
where from the ceiling. Rivulets 
ran toward Kim underfoot among 
the slabs of stone, and Ee knew 
by this that the floor was slanting 
upward. At length the falling cur- 
tains of water grew less numer- 
ous, and the sound diminished to 
a mournful pattering behind him. 
Ahead, the cavern broke into a 
tortured complexity of shapes in 
which he found a narrow passage 
leading upward. He paused to tip 
out the water from his wallet and 
to dry his hair as well as He could 
with his hands; then Ke followed 
the passage. It coiled away ahead 
of him, alwa5^ upward, always 
rounded, irregular, dry and emp- 
ty in the glow of His ligEt-box. 

He followed the passage, and 
at length it widened into a great- 
er darkness. TEorinn stepped out 
into it cautiously, found himself 
162 



in a narrow cavern half-cHoked 
with a pile of fallen stone. Be- 
yond, in the far wall, he saw a 
jagged opening. 

He climbed the Heap of stones 
and peered in. Light glimmered 
back from objects whose forms Ee 
could not make out. A breath of 
air came from the opening, but it 
was slow and stale. He hesitated 
a moment, then climbed through 
the gap in the wall and dropped 
to the level floor below. 

Silence pressed in upon His ears, 
a silence more profound even 
than that of the passage behind 
Km. On every side stood massive 
objects piled one on another, with 
slender rods between them. The 
floor he stood on was perfectly 
level and as smooth as ice. It was 
not stone, but some gray, greasy 
material which seemed faintly 
warm to the touch. The air was 
dry and warm. The huge col- 
umns stood in rows; their tops 
disappeared in the darkness. 

T Eorinn moved between the 
columns, touching them cu- 
riously as he passed. The rods, of 
cold metal, were racks on which 
were piled bundles and bales, and 
other things for which TEorinn 
had no words, all covered with 
some cool, water-smooth sub- 
stance. He began to realize that 
he must be in some giant’s store- 
house, and he paused, listening; 
but the silence was unbroken. 

GALAXY 




He slid his hands curiously 
around one of the bundles. It was 
so smooth and heavy that it was 
hard to find any purchase on it, 
but he dragged it out at last and 
lowered it to the floor. It was al- 
most as broad as his arms could 
span, vaguely oblong but with all 
its comers rounded, like a huge 
gray cheese. He looked in vain for 
any seam or opening; the smooth 
surface was unbroken. 

Next he tried to cut it with his 
sword. At the first touch, the cov- 
ering opened like a mouth. Thor- 
inn put his fingers under the 
edges, marveling at the thinness 
and transparency of the stuff, fin- 
er than the skin of an onion. He 
pulled, and the tear lengthened 
easily. The covering split and 
tore without resistance, and he 
peeled it off in great rustling 
sheets. Underneath was a gray 
soft substance like bread dough; 
he could push it in, but the Hol- 
low filled out again at once, nor 
could he tear it with his fingers. 

Again he used the sword. The 
gray stuff cut readily, but would 
not tear like the other. When he 
pried at the gasH he Had made, 
sticky-looking fibers at the bot- 
tom clung stubbornly together. 
He slashed it deeper, and at last 
it gave way, opening in a slit as 
the transparent stuff had done, 
and he saw something else be- 
neath it: a gleam of russet and 
gold. 

THE STAR BELOW 



He tore away the gray sub- 
stance in lumps, threw thesoi 
aside. In the glow of his ligHt-BoX 
a bundle of cloth lay revealed, 
and he caught his breath. Rich 
and soft beyond belief it was, rus- 
set and gold and scarlet in shim- 
mering patterns that were not 
printed on the fabric but woven 
into it. He unfolded and unwrap- 
ped the cloth, spreading it out on 
the floor as he went; it covered 
the whole width of the aisle, and 
still there was more. TKorinn 
dropped it and stared at it in 
helpless wonder. Such a piece of 
stuff was beyond price; he could 
ask what He liked for it. This one 
bale had made Kim rich. And 
what was in all the others? 

He attacked a second bundle, 
found it contained another cloth 
like the first, colored in deep pur- 
ple, royal blue, peacock green. In 
a fury of impatience, he ran to 
the next aisle, foimd a rack of 
smaller bundles, some of which, 
no bigger than His head, had fall- 
en to the floor. He chose one, 
slashed it open. Inside was a glit- 
tering device of brass and ebony, 
beautifully made, though he 
could not imagine its use. 

The next was a pretty jug with 
a handle and a spout to pour 
from. He tilted it to see why it 
was so Heavy, but only a single 
drop of moisture came out. 

The next was a black-and-red- 
pattemed box in which, nested in 

163 




purple velvet, lay dozens of tiny 
Ixiglit figxirines of men and la- 
dies. 

Stunned witH joy, He ran to tfie 
next aisle and. found otEer out- 
landisH engin^; tHe next: Yen- 
metal knives smaller tHan fiis fin- 
ger, witH tiny blades sHarper tEan 
lust sword; tHe next: Eammers, 
wedges, no bigger tEan tEe knives, 
and other tiny tools wEose use He 
could not guess. 

TEe fever to open more and yet 
more bundles made Him forget 
weariness, cold, tEirst and Eunger. 
He found clotEing — wide-skirt- 
ed robes. Heavy witH brocade; 
tunics and breeks of gossamer 
stuff ; shoes, marvelously tEin and 
supple. He found more engines, 
some with parts tHat turned, some 
that did not move at all. He 
found rings, bracelets, ropes of 
jewels that spilled in a flood 
across the floor. RicHes piled up 
around him, and still He was 
aware that he Had barely begun 
to loot this incredible treasure- 
house. 

V^nce he paused long enough to 
gather all his trove into one 
place and, sorting through it, to 
try to decide wHat He would take 
with him, for it was obvious tHat 
he could not carry even a tenth 
of what he had uncovered so far. 
Then the blank gray faces of tEe 
unopened parcels drove Him to 
jErenzy again, and against all com- 



mon sense He attacked bundles 
larger tHan any He Had yet open- 
ed, gray oblongs taller than He 
was, ripping open tHeir fronts 
without removing them from the 
racks, merely to see wHat was in- 
side them. (Cabinets of i>olisHed 
wood inlaid witH nacre. More en- 
gines. Chairs witH arms curved 
like serpents. More bales of clotH, 
ten times larger than tHe others.) 

Then for weariness alone He 
forebore awhile and sat with His 
Head on His Heavy arms. Hunger 
and thirst returned. He tipped up 
His wallet and drank what little 
water was in it, but it was not 
enough. He began to think of 
finding some container and going 
back through the caverns for wa- 
ter. THe wallet would do, but he 
wanted to keep that dry to Hold 
his treasures. He could put some 
of the smallest things in it, the 
jewels perhaps, and for the rest 
make a bundle to carry on his 
back. But before that he must 
sleep, and before sleep he must 
have water to quench His thirst. 
So He turned the problem back 
and forth, a little thick-headed in 
his weariness, and came to the 
same conclusion ten times over, 
but did nothing because it was so 
much pleasanter not to move. 

Then he remembered the jug, 
and opening his eyes, which' He 
Had closed in order to think bet- 
ter, He saw it at the edge of the 
pile He Had made on the floor. 

GALAXY 




He got up wearily, thinking of 
the long way back through the 
tunnels. When he took up the 
little jug, it seemed to him that 
it was heavier than before. He 
shook it, and it gurgled. Without 
thinking, he tipped it over. Water 
splashed on his feet. 

I- Thorinn righted the jug and 
stared at it. He shook it again, 
and it still gurgled. He put the 
spout cautiously to his lips, tilted 
it up, tasted. It was water, cold 
and pure. He put his Head back 
and drank in great gulps until the 
jug was empty. 

To make sure, he held it upside 
down. A single drop fell, then an- 
other, then no more. He set the 
jug down, sat by it and watched 
it awhile, but nothing happened. 
He picked it up, turned it over: 
water ran out, a thin stream that 
stopped almost at once. But how 
could there be any, when the jug 
had been dry a few moments 
since? 

T Te put the jug down again and 
set himself to watch it, re- 
solved to wait longer this time so 
that there could be no mistake. 
But he grew impatient and, tell- 
ing himself that the jug would do 
well enough by itself, he turned 
his back on it and opened anoth- 
er bundle. This contained an en- 
gine of some sort — a gray box 
with rounded edges, one thicker 
than the others. It had no lid; it 
THE STAR BELOW 



was open but not quite empty. 
The bottom of the box was filled 
with a smooth bulge of glass or 
crystal. It was well made, but not 
especially beautiful, and he had 
engines enough already. Perhaps 
it was time to go and look at the 
jug? No, he had left it alone long- 
er the first time. He picked up 
his light-box and walked down 
an aisle he had not yet explored. 
There were many small bundles 
here. He took one at random and 
of>ened it. Inside the nest of gray 
dough-stuff there were dozens of 
little boxes with bright markings 
on them, green, violet, yellow, 
red. He found the trick of open- 
ing them — you put your thumb- 
nail under one edge of the lid, 
and the box sprang apart. Inside 
was an oblong piece of some 
cheesy substance. Thorinn sniffed 
it, then tore off a crumb and 
tasted it. It was cheese — bland, 
with an unfamiliar flavor, but un- 
deniably cheese. He ate the whole 
piece in two bites, then opened 
another box, and another, and ate 
until his belly was full. Weariness 
forgotten, he carried the rest of 
the boxes back to his treasure 
heap. 

He picked up the little jug; it 
gurgled. He could not see inside 
it very well, but it seemed to be 
at least half full. He drank deep- 
ly, set the jug down. The water 
still remaining made a pleasant 
splash. 

165 




He sat down with his back 
against one of the bales of cloth. 
The box-shaped engine lay near- 
by on the floor. Thorinn lazily 
reached for it^with one foot and 
hooked it nearer. It slid, checked 
en some irregularity in the floor, 
then tipped forward on its heavy 
edge and stood upright. Insde, 
the crystal seemed to flicker with 
colored light for an instant. 

“Here, that’s odd,” said Thor- 
inn, sitting up. 

The box flickered again, and a 
voice spoke. 

^"T^horinn was on his feet without 
knowing how he had got 
there. His sword was in his hand. 
He whirled, looked wildly this 
way and that, then circled the 
heap of treasure and peered be- 
hind the columns, looked down 
the aisles. He listened, heard 
nothing but the pounding of his 
own heart. 

He went back to the box and 
stared at it dubiously. “Was that 
you?” he demanded. 

The voice spoke again, incom- 
prehensibly. It was a man’s deep 
voice, calm and measured; but 
where was it coming from? 

“Are you in there?” Thorinn 
asked, stopping to peer into the 
box. The voice replied. The dark 
crystal lighted up. Thorinn saw 
a confused pattern of light and 
shadow; then part of it moved, 
and he saw a tiny crouched fig- 
166 



ure, dressed in stained leather, 
with a sword in its hand. When 
he moved, it moved. 

“Is that mq?” he cried. 

The voice said, “That me?” 
Thorinn looked at the box with 
deep distrust, withdrew a little 
and sat down facing it. The cry- 
stal had gone dark; now it light- 
ed up again, and he was looking 
as if down a long tunnel at the 
same figure, with a column of 
stacked bundles behind it. It was 
like looking at oneself in a mir-* 
ror. Yet when he raised his sword 
in his right hand, the figure rais- 
ed its sword in its right Hand, not 
its left, as in a proper mirror. 
“You,” said the voice. 

“Yes, it’s me,” Thorinn replied. 
“How do you do that?” 

The crystal went dark. “How 
do me do that?” said the voice. 

“Yes, how do you do?” asked 
Thorinn impatiently. “What’s the 
matter? Why do you talk that 
way?” 

“Why do me talk that way?” 
Thorinn felt baffled, “Yes, why 
do you talk that way?” 

The crystal lighted again. “You 
talk.” 

“Well, of course I talk. I talk 
much better than you.” 

In the crystal, the tiny figure 
seemed to rush forward without 
moving until its face filled the 
box. Thorinn fell silent, but in the 
box he saw his own lips moving. 
“You talk?” asked the voice. The 

GALAXY 




face nisHed forward again, and 
now he saw only the mouth and 
chin. “You talk?” 

/Convinced now that he had to 
deal with an outlander or 
witling, Thorinn said, “Yes, I 
talk,” and gesturing toward his 
own mouth, he spoke with exag- 
gerated clarity, opening his 
mouth wide with each word. “I — 
talk. Talk. You understand?” 
“Talk,” said the voice. “I un- 
derstand.” The crystal darkened, 
lighted again, and Thorinn saw a 
hand. It was his own hand, but 
when he moved his hand, the 
hand in the box did not move. 
“That’s my hand,” he said. 

“I said so didn’t I?” 

“You said so. Talk.” In the 
crystal, now he saw only one fin- 
ger; the rest of the hand had 
turned all misty. 

“That’s my finger.” 

“That’s your finger. Talk.” 
Now he saw his thumb, and he 
told the voice what that was call- 
ed — and then his arm, his leg, 
his foot, his toes, his head, his 
ears, his eyes and so on until he 
lost patience and stood up. “You 
ask too many questions,” he said. 
“You ask.” 

“All right, who are you? How 
did you get in that box?” 

“Box?” 

“Yes, box.” Thorinn squatted, 
touched the box. “This thing. 
This box. How did you get in?” 
THE STAR BELOW 



The crystal lighted, and he was 
looking at the box. A box inade 
the box. The box was not lighted^ 
and it stood on a yellow surface. 
“This box,” said the voice. 

“Yes, the box. How did you get 
inside it?” 

“I are this box. Talk.” The 
crystal glowed, and Thorinn saw 
a man in stiff scarlet robes, with 
a shimmer of green and gold be- 
hind him. “That’s a man. He 
must be rich.” 

The man disappeared, and fie 
saw a woman with fair hair, 
dressed in similar robes. “That’s 
a woman. Is it his wife?” 

So they went on, and Tfiorinni 
told the box what a boy wag 
called, a girl, a tree, a leaf, a 
branch; but sometimes the box 
showed him engines or otfiec 
shapes he had never seen before, 
and he would say, “Wfiat’s tfiat?” 
or “I don’t know what tfiat is.” 
At last his head began to droop, 
and the pictures in the box grew 
so blurred that fie could not make 
them out at all. “Talk,” said tfie 
box. His head came up witfi a 
painful jerk, and he realized tfiat 
he had been asleep for just an 
instant. 

“No more talk,” fie said thick- 
ly. “Good night.” The box said 
nothing. Thorinn, too dizzy to get 
up, rolled onto a pile of folded 
cloth, pulled an edge of it over 
him for a blanket and was in- 
stantly asleep. 



167 




II 




T T^en he awoke, he had for- 
’ * gotten all that had Happen- 
ed and at first did not know 
where he was. TJhen joy filled him 
when he saw his treasures. He 
pottered about among them for 
a while, examining this and that, 
drank from the magical jug, 
then crawled through' the Hole in 
the wall to relieve himself out- 
side, came back, opened one of 
the boxes of cheese for his break- 
fast and began to plan what he 
should do next. 

He would take only a few of 
the choicest things, and a supply 
of food, for his intention now was 
to try to come up into the Mid- 



168 



GALAXY 





world as near as possible to the 
Highlands and to walk the rest 
of the distance, carrying his pack. 
Once there, he would sell some 
of his treasures to buy land and 
horses ; later, he would come back 
to the cavern, taking care he was 
not followed: he would bring a 
pack train, and this time carry 
home enough treasure to keep 
him for the rest of his life. Think- 
ing of this, he began to worry 
about brigands and to think that 
he would certainly have to be ac- 
companied by some armed men. 
They would have to be trusted 
men, so that they would not rob 
him themselves; yet, even so, he 
would have to conceal from them 
the place where he went imder- 
THE STAR BELOW 



ground, so that they should not 
follow him. These thoughts gave 
him a headache and made Him 
feel out of sorts, and he conclud- 
ed that it was not easy to be 
rich. 

The box had said nothing since 
he awakened, and he was glad of 
that for it had tired him with its 
chatter the day before. It was a 
clever box in its way, for it pro- 
nounced everything perfectly and 
never had to be told anything 
more than once, but in other ways 
it was very stupid and seemed 
never to have heard of the com- 
monest things. 

He had another drink from the 
jug and set off straight down tHe 
aisle, meaning to follow it to the 
end. The tall columns marched 
past him with their heads buried 
in the darkness. There was no 
sound but his own footsteps. Here 
and there small parcels had been 
knocked to the floor, and he con- 
jectured that an earth-shock must 
have done that; probably that 
was the cause, too, of the gap in 
the wall through which he had 
entered. Before that, the cavern 
must have been sealed up . for 
how long? 

He stopped, listened. The qual- 
ity of the silence in the cavern 
was the same, a feeling of vast 
space. When he scraped his foot 
on the floor, no sharp echo came 
back from ahead, where the wall 
of the cavern ought to be. When 

169 




he had gone another hundred 
paces, he stopped again, and it 
was just the same. He had sup- 
posed this must be a small cav- 
ern, like those outside; but what 
if it were huge? 

The thought of so much treas- 
ure, endless, uncountable rows of 
it, oppressed him instead of rais- 
ing his spirits. After a moment he 
turned and started back. 

Tn no time at all, it seemed, he 
-*■ was back at his heap of treas- 
ure. 

“Box,” he said. 

There was no answer, and the 
box did not light up. 

Alarmed, he took a step near- 
er. “Box, are you there?” 

“I am here,” said the box. 
“Well, why didn’t you answer 
before?” 

"You did not ask.” 

“Oh.” Thorinn thought about 
this a moment. "Well, how big is 
this cave?” 

“What is this cave?” 

“This cave,” Thorinn said, 
waving his arms. “This place 
here, where we are.” 

“What is how big?” 

“How big,” Thorinn said, wav- 
ing his arms again by way of ex- 
planation. “How many ells?” 
“What are ells?” 

Thorinn sat down on the floor 
and stared at the box in exaspera- 
tion. “Ells are — well, anybody 
knows that. Ells are how long 
170 



something is.” He spread his 
hands apart. “This is an ell.” 
The box said, “How long are 
you?” 

“You mean how tall. Two ells. 
I’m two ells tall.” 

In the crystal, two yellow 
marks appeared. “How many?” 
“Two.” 

One of the marks vanished. 
“How many?” 

“One.” 

Two more appeared. “How 
many?” 

“Three.” 

The box, Thorinn realized, did 
not even know how to count. So 
they went on until they got to 
twenty-one, and then the box 
said, “Two tens are twenty?” 
“Yes, that’s right, and three 
tens are thirty.” 

“And four tens?” 

“Four tens, are forty. Five tens 
are fifty, six tens are sixty.” At a 
hundred and ten, the box stopped 
him again. 

“Ten tens are a hundred?” 
“Yes.” 

“This cave is eight hundred 
fifty ells long, fifteen ells tall.” In 
the crystal, a brightly lighted lit- 
tle hollow shape appeared. It was 
like a very long, narrow box. At 
“eight hundred fifty ells long,” a 
yellow line appeared from one 
end to the other. At “fifteen ells 
taU,” a short yellow line appear- 
ed, standing erect, crosswise to 
the other. Then a third line ap- 

GALAXY 




peared, across Hie widtK of tfie 
box. “Three hundred nineteen 
ells.” 

“Three hundred nineteen ells 
wide?" 

“Yes, three hundred nineteen 
ells wide.” 

“And eight hundred ells long?’’ 

“Eight hundred fifty ells long.” 

Thorinn was silent in amaze- 
ment. “Is it all full »f things?” 

“What is full?” 

“I mean is part of it empty, Of 
is it all full of stacks of things 
like this?” 

“It is all full of stacks of 
things.” 

Thorinn tried to imagine it and 
could not. Where could such an 
incredible accumulation of treas- 
ures have come from?” 

“Who made this cave?” he ask- 
ed. 

“What is made?” 

'^horinn tried to explain and 
grew hot-faced from exas- 
peration. “Well, look here,” He 
said finally and picked up his 
light-box. “I made this box. I cut 
these pieces of wood and glued 
them together, and I fitted the 
pieces of mica in here at the ends 
— well, one of them is gone now, 
I lost it in the river. Then I made 
the lid and put it on here, and 
then the box was made, you see. 
I made it.” 

In the crystal, an image of 
Thorinn appeared, fitting little

pieces of wood together. It was 
•ver in a moment, and the figure 
held a light-box in its hand. 
“You made this box?” 

“That’s right. Now who made 
all this? Who made you?” 

“A box made me.” 

“You mean you made your- 
self?” 

“I mean I made me?” 

“WeU, did you?” 

“A box made this box.” In the 
crystal appeared a huge black 
engine, out of the end of which, 
•ne after another, were dropping 
little gray boxes, each with' a 
glint of crystal inside it. They 
floated away out of sight; it 
made Thoriim dizzy to watch 
them. 

“You mean an engine. An en- 
gine made you — and all these 
other things?” 

“Engines made me and all 
these other things.” 

“Well, but who made the en- 
gines?” 

“Engines made the engines.” 
Thorinn gave it up. He made 
the box show him the picture of 
the cave again, then what was 
around it. In the new picture, the 
cave was a tiny bright shape at 
the center, while all around it 
other transparent passages ran off 
in every direction, some twisting, 
some straight. His idea had been 
to find out the best way back to 
the Midworld, but as he asked the 
box to show him more and still 

171 




more, he grew fascinated by the 
maze of passages, caverns and 
shafts crisscrossing each other; 
there seemed to be no end to it. 
New lines kept floating into the 
picture, while tHe old ones grew 
smaller and closer together. “How 
did it ever come to be like that?” 
he asked. “The whole world?” 

In the crystal, the network of 
lines vanished and a man’s face 
appeared, brown and smiling; at 
least Thorinn supposed he was a 
man, though he was beardless. 
His black hair was cut short and 
combed back, exposing his ears 
and forehead. His lips moved. Af- 
ter a moment the box said, “This 
is the world.” Behind the brown- 
faced man a big green and blue 
mottled ball was floating, against 
a background of darkness. The 
man’s lips went on moving, but 
no sound came. The ball receded, 
grew very small. 

^ “What is he saying?” Thorinn 
asked. “Let me hear what he 
says.” 

XTow the man himself began 
-*■ ^ speaking, but it was gibber- 
ish; Thorinn could not under- 
stand a word. The ball was tiny 
now, and to one side of it, over 
the man’s head, a dot of yellow 
light appeared. It grew slowly; 
suddenly it was very big and 
bright, and Thorinn could see 
flames leaping from its surface. 

Then it aU vanished, and in- 
172 



stead he was looking at a green 
landscape dotted with men and 
women who were all standing 
looking up at something huge and 
flat and silvery that was receding 
slowly overhead, as if somehow 
they had brought the sky down 
and now were raising it again. 
The man’s voice was still speak- 
ing, but Thorinn could not see 
where he was. Now the sky was 
high overhead where it belonged, 
and little dark engines were mov- 
ing across it. 

Then it changed again, and 
they were underground, watching 
a huge engine that ate its way 
into the solid rock, leaving a 
bright round tunnel behind it. 
Then there were scenes of great 
caverns full 'of engines and peo- 
ple, and floating egg-shaped 
things that crossed the caverns 
and darted along tunnels, up and 
down shafts, all brightly lit, shin- 
ing. Then the brown man again, 
and behind him a picture like the 
drawing of the Underworld the 
box had shown him before, only 
it was circular, with many rings 
one inside the other and four 
straight lines radiating from the 
smallest circle of all, in the center. 
Then the circle changed into a 
ball again; this time it was white. 
Watching these pictures made 
Thorinn uneasy in a way he could 
not understand; it was like being 
afraid, and because there was 
nothing to be afraid of, this made 

GALAXY 




him angry. The brown man was 
still speaking; the yellow point of 
light had appeared, and the sil- 
very ball, itself shrunken to a dot, 
was crawling away from it toward 
a cloud of other bright dots. Now 
the other dots swung, came clos- 
er, darting forward like frost- 
flakes in a storm until only one 
Hung in the center of the crystal, 
growing larger and brighter. 

“That’s enough,” Thorinn said. 
The crystal went dark. 

“I haven’t all day to sit watch- 
ing such stuff,” he said. “It’s all 
nonsense anyhow,” and He began 
turning over his Heap of treasures, 
trying to decide what to take and 
what to leave behind. 

Ill 

^"T^he magic jug was a problem. 

He thought of hanging it 
from his belt, but that would be 
awkward; and unless He could 
contrive some sort of lid for it, 
the jug would be spilling water 
down his leg. Whereas if he put it 
in his wallet, it would take up too 
much room. He could fill the jug 
with jewels, but then would the 
water run over? 

He remembered that when he 
had first taken the jug from its 
wrapping, there had been no 
water in it or, at any rate, only 
a drop. Was it being wrapped up 
that made the difference? It was 
worth trying, anyhow. He cut a 
THE STAR BELOW 



piece of the transparent stuff, 
wrapped it around the jug after 
pouring the water out and tied it 
tightly with strips of the same 
material. Later, when he came 
back from a trip to gather food, 
he opened it, and it was still al- 
most dry. He filled it to the brim 
with jewels, wrapped it again and 
put it in his wallet. 

The smallest piece of cloth he 
had was far too bulky to carry, 
but he cut off a strip half an ell 
wide and as long as he was tall. 
He spread this on the floor and 
rolled up His cHeeseboxes and 
other things in it — clothing, 
shoes, the little figurines, tools 
and knives, the box, some left- 
over jewels — turning the ends in 
as he went. He did this twice 
over before he had the roll pack- 
ed to his liking, with the heavier 
things in the middle, the food 
outside where it could be easily 
reached. He tied it with strips erf 
cloth and with other strips con- 
trived loops which would fit over 
his shoulders. 

The box had said nothing while 
he was packing it, nor had he 
spoken to it. Th’orinn felt a little 
hangdog about this, as if He had 
been lacking'^in politeness; but he 
reminded himself that the box 
was only an engine, and it prob- 
ably did not care. 

At any rate, the box had said 
that the cave was eight hundred 
fifty ells long and three hundred 

173 




nineteen ells wide; and in the pic- 
ture it had shown him, there had 
been a tiny shaft through its roof 
to a tunnel above. It was near 
one end of the cavern as regards 
length and in ^e middle as re- 
gards width. If he could find it 
without wasting too much time 
in the search, it would be the 
quickest and best way out of the 
cavern, and Thorinn thought he 
knew how it could be done. 

He set off down the aisle, 
counting his paces, and when he 
had gone a hundred and fifty ells. 
He turned to his right and began 
counting again. When He had 
gone six hundred ells, a gray wall 
loomed up ahead; he had reached 
the end of the cavern. He swung 
himself up onto the nearest rack 
and began to climb it. 

The bottoms of the stacks dis- 
* appeared: he was climbing in the 
fitful glow of his light-box witK 
darkness all around. In the si- 
lence, the rack with' its gray bun- 
dles seemed to glide downward 
past his body, as if he were not 
climbing at all, but hanging in 
midair and pulling down more 
and more of the rack like an end- 
less serpent. In a few moments he 
saw a dim gray reflection over- 
head. It was the ceiling, and when 
he stood on top of the stack a 
moment later he could reach up 
and touch it with his hands. He 
could see the tops of other stacks 
to left and right, gray hummocks 
174 



rising out of the darkness, but 
there was no sign of any opening 
in the roof of the cave. 

He turned away from the cav- 
ern wall, leaped to the next stack, 
then to the next, examining the 
ceiling from each. When he had 
traversed ten stacks in this way, 
he leaped the aisle to the next row 
and began working back along it, 
meaning to trace a path around 
and around the original ten 
stacks, like a man winding string 
on a twig, until he found the op- 
ening; but he had hardly begun 
his second cast when it appeared, 
off to his left: a round black hole 
in the ceiling. 

'■p'he shaft was circular and 
three spans wide. Standing 
under it and stretching up his 
arm with the light-box, he 
thought he could make out a 
brownish something that might 
be a shield closing it at the top. 

Standing on his toes, he could 
just get his hands onto the 
smooth walls of the shaft; but 
that was no matter. He planted 
himself directly under the open- 
ing, bent his knees, leaped. As 
he shot up into the opening, 
he put out his arms and knees, 
braced himself, came to rest. 
A thrust and a wriggle, and he 
was half an ell farther up; now 
he could support himself with' 
hands and feet on one side, back 
against the other. Hampered a 

GALAXY 




little by tHe bundle across Kis 
sHoulders, He still was able to 
climb rapidly enougK. In a few 
moments His Head was toucHing 
tfie brown Hollow disk tfiat closed 
tKe sHaft. He toucHed it, and it 
swung aside; a black cusp widen- 
ed to a circle. He was up, tfirougK 
it into darkness tHat turned sud- 
denly to a flicker of pale li^t. 

As those vast arcHing shapes 
exploded around him in a kind of 
silent sizzling, TKorinn flattened 
Himself to the floor. Tfie cold 
shield was under His Hand; He 
slapped it frantically, felt it 
swing, felt tKe cool upward 
breath', then tKe sKaft walls were 
burning His Hands and knees as 
He braked His fall; tHe sHield 
swung over His Head, and tfie 
light was gone. 

With’ pounding Heart, THorinn 
Hung in tHe sHaft and stared up- 
ward. There was no sound. He 
tried to remember wKat He Had 
seen: vast arcs of ligHt that 
swooped up flickering into tKe 
darkness . '. WKat could it Have 
been? He was ready to let go and 
drop instantly, if tKe shield 
should begin to turn; but nothing 
Happened. At last He nerved Him- 
self to climb tKe shaft again. 

He put His Hand on the sHield, 
turned it carefully. A lozenge of 
darkness appeared; there was no 
sound, no scent of danger. THor- 
inn widened tHe opening until it 
was black and round above Him. 
THE STAR BELOW 



The lights, whatever they were, 
were gone completely. With pain- 
staking caution He thrust His head 
ifp; then, bracing Himself to hold 
the i sHield open, raised his arm 
witfi tfie light-box. Darkness. He 
raised Himself a little. Head and 
sHoulders through the opening; 
and a sudden flicker burst almost 
under His chin, ran away swoop- 
ing and shimmering upward in 
multiple arcs . 

Wfien He ducked His Head 
down, the flickering died; dark- 
ness returned. After a moment he 
raised Himself again. The lights 
sprang up, flickering, swooping 
far overhead. Tfiey steadied, 
burned clear and cold. TKorinn 
raised Himself a little more, cau- 
tiously, tKfen still more, and fi- 
nally climbed out. 

IV 

T T e was standing at tKe bottom 
of a vast tunnel wKose walls 
curved up to become tfie ceiUng 
an incredible distance overKead. 
The lines of light ringed it; the 
nearest, only an ell away, was a 
white ribbon that curved up, up, 
growing thinner until it was no 
more than a bright thread above. 
On either side of it were others, 
set three ells apart. In one di- 
rection they were dazzling bright, 
in the other ihucH dimmer and 
more diffuse; He coimted twenty 
of eacK. The reason for tKe dif- 

175 




ference, Be saw now, was tfiat lEe 
rings were ligfited only on one 
side, so tKat in one direction Be 
saw not tBe ligBts tBemselves but 
their reflections in tBe tunnel 
wall. As Be look^ down tBe tun- 
nel, the farthest ones were perfect 
upright circles, but tBose nearer 
to him grew fatter at tfie bottom 
until they were vast egg-sBapes 
that leaned togetfier overhead. 

He was trembling; wfiy Bad tBe 
box not made Bim understand 
how huge tfiese tiumels were? He 
felt himself tiny and exposed; the 
distant rings were like giants’ eyes 
staring. He glanced for comfort 
at the closed shield in the floor, 
then leaned to examine the near- 
est ring more closely. Tfie floor 
was of some smooth, Bard sub- 
stance; embedded in it, tfie ring 
stood up two spans fiigfi, Bollow 
on tfie bright side, flat on tfie 
other, with a flat dark edge tfie 
breadth of his Band. He touched 
tfie dark surface cautiously, then 
the bright; one was as cool as the 
other. 

He Hopped over it and took a 
stride toward the next ring. Far 
down at tfie black end of tfie tun- 
nel, there w§s a flicker: a new 
ring inside the otfiers. Tfiorinn 
stared at it; something was 
wrong. He turned, counting tfie 
bright rings, and tfiere were still 
twenty. 

He began to walk in long float- 
ing strides down tfie middle of 
176 



the tunnel. Each time Be soared 
over one of the rings, a new one 
appeared ahead; the eye of black- 
ness at the end of tfie tunnel re- 
mained always the same^ He 
thought of the pictures in the box 
and of the egg-shaped things that 
darted along the tunnels, up and 
down the giant shafts. And tfie 
lights followed them wfierever 
they went, so tfiat wfiere they 
were, there was ligfit; and wfien 
they had passed, the tunnel wait- 
ed in darkness . 

He began to move faster, tfien 
to run, in order to see the bright 
rings run on ahead. A kind of ex- 
hilaration took him, and He ran 
faster and faster, as if fie could 
catch the fleeing rings of light. 
The tunnel slipped by Him in 
sepulchral silence, and again fie 
began to feel that Be was not 
moving at all, but posturing mo- 
tionless in the air while the illu- 
sory tunnel flowed past him, out 
of one nothingness into another. 

Without warning, the black eye 
at the end of the tunnel flared 
bright. Thorinn stumbled to a 
halt, arms flailing. What Bad 
been a black disk an instant ago 
was now a globe of light, striped 
with faint dark lines as if it were 
a spinning top, and for a moment 
the illusion was so strong that fie 
almost turned to flee, certain tfiat 
the monstrous globe, which filled 
the tunnel, was whirling down 
upon him. Then he saw that it 

GALAXY 




was not bulging, but Hollow; He 
was looking througH tHe end of 
the tunnel into some vast lighted 
space beyond. 

H s he approached, the last ring 
of the tunnel grew enormous 
around him, and he saw that the 
space beyond was a great shaft, 
striped with horizontal rings of 
light. Where the tunnel met the 
shaft, it flared out smoothly 
above and below; the floor drop- 
ped away with deceptive gentle- 
ness, like water pouring over the 
lip of a chasm, and the light-rings 
became ovals instead of circles. 
Using them as a ladder, Thorinn 
found that he could venture down 
the slope; and now he saw his 
way upward. To either side, the 
upright rings gave way to the 
horizontal rings of the shaft. He 
had only to descend to the lowest 
ring in the flared mouth of the 
tunnel, then step onto the nearest 
horizontal ring and begin to 
climb. 

The dark upper surface of the 
ring was flat and level and two 
spans wide; he was able to walk 
on it with ease, knowing that if 
he stumbled he could reach up to 
catch himself against the lighted 
surface of the ring above. He was 
aware of the gulf beside him, but 
tried not to think of it Above, 
the shaft was lighted for sixty 
ells, then vanished into darkness. 
Below — 

THE STAR BELOW 



Some perversity made him 
want to see down into the depths 
of the shaft, even though it meant 
that he had to lean outward, 
bracing his hands against the ov- 
erhanging lip of the ring above. 

It was the same below, or al- 
most the same — twenty rings of 
soft light merging into one an- 
other, then blackness. But in that 
blackness, close to the edge on 
which he stood, burned a fierce 
blue-white point of light. It was 
tiny and unwinking; he could not 
tell how far away it was, but he 
thought it must be very deep, or 
he would have been able to see 
it before. 

He gazed downward awhile 
without moving, then straighten- 
ed. He was dizzy, and he shook 
his head to clear it. The sight of 
that tiny brilliant dot had af- 
fected him profoundly, in a way 
he could not understand. 

The brown man speaking His 
gibberish, and the tiny dots of 
light that moved . 

He could not think, standing 
here on the narrow ledge. After a 
moment he toned back to the 
mouth of the tunnel and climbed 
the rings again until the wall be- 
gan sloping back steeply, and he 
could sit down without taking off 
his pack and lean his back 
against it, with his legs dangling 
over the gulf. 

Whatever he did, he must rest, 
eat and drink. He opened his wal- 

177 




let and took out a box of clieese. 
He unwrapped tKe magic jug and 
set it beside Kim, witHout trou- 
bling to empty out tfie jewels. 
After a little he tipped it to fiis 
mouth and found, fie fiad fiop- 
ed, that tfiere was water in it, 
enough to satisfy his tfiirst. Wfien 
he had finished, fie wrapped it 
up again. 

The question was what was he 
going to tell people wfien fie got 
back? Nothing fiad turned out as 
he expected. Tfie eartfi fiad not 
grown colder as fie descended; 
here in the shaft it was only as 
cool as a spring morning in Ho- 
venskar. As for demons and gi- 
ants, he had met none of them. 
How could it have come about 
that the Underworld was so dif- 
ferent from what people believed? 

It seemed to Thorinn that tfie 
vast emptiness was speaking to 
him, trying to convey some mean- 
ing which he could not quite 
grasp. He had touched it again 
and again, in the treasurehouse, 
in the caverns, in the dark tunnels 
and passageways, and eacH time 
it had slipped away from him. 

He began to grow angry with 
himself, for of course the only 
thing to do was to go straight up 
the shaft to the Midworld. 

Jle put the jug back in his wal- 
let, climbed down and worked 
his way out on the horizontal 
ring again. He leaned out once 
more to look at that tiny, bril- 
178 



liant point of light; and it was 
still there, unmoving. 

'^here fiad been a word tfiat the 
brown man spoke, over and 
over, wfien fie was talking of tfie 
bright dots that moved in dark- 
ness: star. 

Coidd that be a “star,” down 
there, in the depths of tfie Under- 
world? Perhaps if fie knew wfiat 
a star was, fie would know wfiat 
the brown man fiad been tr3ung 
to say about tfie world; perhaps 
fie would even learn why it was 
that all these great works, made 
by man, were now empty of man. 

And now some demon began to 
whisper to him tfiat it could not 
be so very far to tfie bottom of 
the shaft, tfiat fie could soon 
climb down and see tfie star, then 
climb back, with no harm done; 
and although fie knew this was 
perverse and foolish, fie could not 
resist it. 

After all, wfiat had fie ever 
gained by caution? And how 
could He go back to the Mid- 
world knowing that He Had Had 
the chance to see such a marvel 
and had refused it? 

When he knew that his mind 
was made up, fie felt a trembling 
of fear in his belly. But He knelt, 
put fiis weight on his hands; he 
let fiimself swing over and began 
to climb down tfie shaft toward 
the center of the Eartfi.

HEMEAC reporting, Her. The Janitor spilled 
oil on the floor. After the Trouble. Clide." 



Instructor made a short, 
sharp and sibilant sound. Im- 
mediately, the classroom was fill- 
ed with one of those ominous 
silences that were becoming so 
common lately. While she made 
those faint stuttering sounds to 
herself, everyone waited in quiet, 
rigid terror. 

HEMEAC stood at his desk 
near the back, breathing deeply 
and slowly, controlling his fear 
and attentively watching the 
glittering flatness of the Instruc- 
tor’s scanner. He knew that these 
things often indicated that some- 
one would be sent to the Dean’s 
office for a Special Examination, 
but a good student such as he 



was did not break into trembling 
perspiration at the mere threat of 
a Special Examination. He kept 
telling himself this with mute in- 
tellectual vehemence, while his 
knees trembled under his silver 
rnail tunic and a trickling rivulet 
of perspiration slid down his 
spine. 

Involuntarily, his eyes dropped 
to the desk in front of him. Last 
week, lAC had been there, as he 
had been for the past sixteen 
years — as long as HEMEAC 
could remember. Then, somehow, 
he had made a mistake, probably 
a missed command for which he 
couldn’t give an explanation. At 
any rate, he had been called up 



to the Dean’s office for a Special 
Examination. He Had failed, as 
practically everybody else did 
these days, and Had been prompt- 
ly expelled from tKe University. 

Dim, Katf-formed images of 
menace grew in HEMEAC’s 
imagination as He considered tfie 
Outside World, wHere lAC was 
now. Beyond the impregnable 
gates of this comfortable Univer- 
sity lay that war-torn ruin of a 
dying planet, a region of savages, 
kijustice and bestiality, ruled by 
idiot renegades. The Savages Had 
lAC now. HEMEAC wondered 
if they Had already eaten him. 

“HEMEAC!” sounded the 
crisp, level voice of the Instruc- 
tor. “Eyes front!” 

“Click,” said HEMEAC with 
terrified calm, as he raised his 
eyes from the empty desk to the 
scanner where they belonged. 

“Recite,” she ordered. “Define 
the term ‘education.’ ” 

“Click. By education is meant 
the training and disciplining of 
those beings who can be benefit- 
ted by such’ improvement. Such’ 
as humans and some of the high- 
er animals.” 

Qilence for a long moment. Then 
the Instructor said, “Inac- 
curate and incomplete, HEME- 
AC. Education is the leading of 
an organic intellect into higher 
orders of perfection of knowledge 
and discipline. Note the word ‘or- 
18 » 



ganic’. Do you know why that is 
included in the definition, HE- 
MEAC?” 

“Because,” He replied witfi 
quick student’s logic, “robots do 
not Have to be educated.” 

“Inaccurate,” stated tfie In- 
structor calmly. “THe robotic in- 
telligence not only does not Have 
to be educated, it cannot be edu- 
cated. Tfie full perfection of its 
mode of action is already com- 
plete in its first operation. Per- 
fection, in tKe sense of Having 
achieved tHe ultimate in its de- 
velopment, is intrinsic to tKe ro- 
botic being. Robots do not learn. 
Except for accidental information 
of a superfidal nature, tfiey al- 
ready know all that is necessary 
for full functionability wKen they 
are turned on. Tfiis is true even of 
those robots wKo Have a curioso- 
reflex in tiieir circuitry. HEME- 
AC, do you know wKat a curioso- 
reflex is?” 

“Click. It is a random-informa- 
tion-seeker.” 

THe Instructor waited. HEME- 
AC dutifully continued his mem- 
orized recitation. 

“It is included in all primary 
control computers, of whicK only 
one remains in service Here at the 
University. Organic intellects 
Have a similar S3rstem for the 
random study of potentially use- 
ful information, which is called 
curiosity because of its resem- 
blance to the curioso. Like most 

GALAXY 




oth'er organic faculties. However, 
it is subject to individual volun- 
tary control, and therefore is not 
as efficient as the curioso.” 

“Very w^ll,” said the Instruc- 
tor. She Hummed and buzzed and 
clicked for a few moments, after 
whicK she added, “This is a class 
in Social Philosophy, HEMEAC, 
not Robot Circuitry. Kindly stick 
to the subject in the future.” 

“Click,” said HEMEAC. 

The Instructor was briefly si- 
lent again, as her scanner exam- 
ined the student listing before 
calling on another boy. 

“OBSIC.” 

“Click,” piped the boy. 

“Describe the purpose of edu- 
cation.” 

“The purpose of education,” 
stated OBSIC in calm, even 
tones, “is to develop the human 
mind so that it may approach 
the natural perfection of the ro- 
botic intelligence as closely as its 
limited faculties will permit.” 

H is voice went on in rote reci- 
tation, but HEMEAC’s mind 
was wandering again. He glanced 
at the empty desk in front of Him 
and wondered what it was really 
like out there in the Outside 
World where there were no robots 
any more with their beautiful 
shiny faces, but only animals and 
ruins. HEMEAC had some diffi- 
culty in visualizing a Human be- 
ing like himself living as an ani- 
HEMEAC 



mal, but he knew that it was so. 
He had seen them once from that 
window in the Dean’s office. 

He pictured himself marching 
out the low, triple-sealed gate, as 
lAC had been forced to do, and 
falling into the Hands of the wild, 
barking savages who alwa37S wait- 
ed there for just that very thing. 

And there was good reason for 
them to wait, too. The University 
expelled somebody almost every 
week lately. 

“Why all the staUing, HEME- 
AC?” he suddenly heard the Iii- 
structor annoimce in a loud voice. 

Terrified, he looked around and 
saw that the class period was 
over and that the other students 
were filing out into the corridor 
in an orderly line, while there he 
was — still standing at his desk. 

“Her,” he mumbled, “some- 
body spilled oil in the corridor. X 
could smell it.” Spilled oil. He 
knew, was always a matter for 
legitimate concern. And oil was 
always being spilled. 

“What does oil in the corridor 
have to do with your time sense?” 
asked the Instructor. 

“It is a waste. It should be re- 
ported.” 

“It has already been reported,” 
said the Instructor, dismissing 
him. “Pay better attention in the 
future.” 

“Click!” HEMEAC turned and 
Half ran toward the door. 

“Stiffly there, HEMEAC,” sHe 

181 




admonished Him. “Stiffly. And 
less af that random motion. 
THafs just as wasteful as spilling 
oil.” 

Obediently, HEMEAC slowed 
down and walked with' tKe cor- 
rect, measured pace, his shoulders 
tKrown back, head erect, eyes for- 
ward, mind blank. Or almost 
blank, at least. That unadmitted 
terror was still there. 

He managed to fall in at the 
end of the line and followed the 
rest of the students down the 
long, cluttered, oil-stained corri- 
dor, down the steps, down more 
dirty corridors and more steps 
through the huge building until 
they finally reached the dormi- 
tory level. There he filed in with 
the rest of the class, a pitifully 
small group of students in a hall 
built for thousands, walking 
slowly and precisely past the rows 
of cubicles until they came to 
their own. 

TTEMEAC was still walking af- 
ter the rest had stopped, be- 
catise he was out of His regular 
place in the line. Fearfully, aware 
of the all-seeing eye of the Moni- 
tor, he moved up to His cubicle, 
stopped and waited. Like all the 
other students, he stood and wait- 
ed for the command, listening to 
the disciplined rustle of their col- 
leagues as they also breathed and 
waited, every nerve alert. 

There was a sudden rush of 

182 



sound as the other students turn- 
ed in a body and walked into 
their cubicles. HEMEAC, realiz- 
ing he had missed the command 
again, quickly turned himself and 
took one step across the thresh- 
old. 

“HEMEAC,” said the voice of 
the Monitor. 

“Click.” He froze where he was, 
one foot inside the cubicle, the 
other foot still in the corridor. 

“Moving too jerky. What’s the 
matter, didn’t you get the com- 
mand?” 

“Click. I got it,” he lied. 

“Why the delay?” 

“There was some oil spilled in 
the classroom corridor,” HEME- 
AC suggested hopefully. “Out of 
the comer of his eye, he saw that 
another student had unwisely 
paused to listen to the discussion. 
The Monitor saw it too, of course, 
and snapped, “Mind blank!” and 
the erring boy quickly scurried on 
inside his cubicle. 

“Now then, HEMEAC,” the 
Monitor went on. “What does oil 
in the classroom corridor have to 
do with your time-command 
sense?” 

“It is such a waste,” said HE- 
MEAC. He tried to think of an 
excuse that he had not used so 
recently. None came. “It was — 
you know—” His voice trailed 
off. 

The Monitor hummed an off- 
key note. “Waiting, HEMEAC.” 

GALAXY 




Frantically the boy thought, 
his well trained mind racing 
around in an inaudible flutter of 
synapses and the gallop of mgent 
ideas. He thought of lAC and the 
Outside World and the Special 
Examination he might have to 
take if he couldn’t figure out an 
acceptable excuse for his failure. 
He knew that the reason why he 
had missed the command was a 
preoccupying fear, but to admit 
such a thing wduld be disastrous. 
“There was oil,” he said lamely. 
“I slipped on it a little, and in 
maintaining my balance, I think 
I strained a muscle.” 

The Monitor hummed off and 
on, as she considered the excuse. 
Finally she said, “Very, well, HE- 
MEAC. Report to the Physician 
after fueling.” 

“Click,” said the boy in a wav- 
ering voice. 

“And watch your speech,” the 
Monitor added loudly. “You are 
using high order tonals. You 
should have passed them three 
years ago.” 

“Click,” agreed HEMEAC 
dully. 

“That’s better.” 

T TEMEAC. understanding that 
he had been dismissed for 
the moment, lifted his second foot 
and placed it beside the other in 
his cubicle, and the door hummed 
shut behind him. The light sprang 
from the ceiling, bathing every- 
HEMEAC 



thing in the tiny room with a 
soft, cool effulgence, including the 
milky porridge that was waiting 
on a tray. HEMEAC sat down 
and ate, carefully holding himself 
erect and stiff, moving his arm 
and mouth as little as possible. 
He tried to blank his mind, but it 
kept wondering about the excuse 
he would have to give the Physi- 
cian for not having any strained 
muscles. 

It was difficult for a person to 
survive in this, the last cozy re- 
treat of world civilization. And 
somehow it seemed to be becom- 
ing rapidly more difficult. Par- 
ticularly during the past year, the 
perfect reasonableness of the ro- 
botic intelligence had seemed in- 
explicable to him. The thought of 
his lack of normal progress to- 
ward the ideal tortured him al- 
most as much as his fear of the 
fatal expulsion it might incur. 

Mind blank, mind blank, mind 
blank, he recited to himself. 

Some day, he thought, it will 
be good and I will not have to be 
afraid of missing commands or 
not understanding the purposes 
of things, and then maybe the 
Dean will let me do design work 
in the machine shop. 

Mind blank, he said to himself. 

He pictured the beautiful, blue- 
gleaming perfection of an inte- 
grally-lubricated joint and smil- 
ed. But the smile did not reach' 
his lips. It stayed in his mind 

183 




where sharp-eyed Monitors would 
not see it. 

Mind blank, he said to Himself. 

He thought of the tired face 
and terrified eyes that were all He 
remembered of ^lAC, marcHing 
toward the gate. He tKougfit of 
the Outside World wKere people 
were animals and Had no robots 
to teach' them. 

Mind blank, He said to Himself. 

The bowl was empty, and His 
stomach was full. Unconsciously, 
HEMEAC breathed a sigK of ani- 
mal contentment. He placed tKe 
spoon beside the bowl on tHe tray 
and stiffly waited. There was a 
command due for Him to report 
to the Physician, right after tKe 
other students were commanded 
to report to class, and this time 
he was confident He would get it. 

/^ut in tKe corridor there came 
a rumbling as tKe otHer stu- 
dents marcKed back to tKe after- 
noon class in History. He waited. 

Now, he said to Himself. 

He stood up; tKe door opened, 
and He walked out into tKe corri- 
dor, moving down tKe row of cu- 
bicles with measured, precise 
pace. Head up, shoulders back, 
chest out, eyes straight ahead and 
mind blank. Well, almost blank, 
anyway. He was wondering if He 
had timed it right. 

“HEMEAC.” 

He stopped abruptly and stopd 
with rigid obedience. “Click.” 

184 



“Ninety four seconds late. Why 
tKe delay? Didn’t you get the 
command to report for class?” 
“Click. I got it. But my com- 
mand was to report to the Physi- 
cian, wHicK comes after tKe com- 
mand to report to class.” 

TKe Monitor Hummed and 
buzzed. SKe said, “Correct. You 
may proceed.” But then she 
quickly added a sKort “ssszzzz,” 
and snapped, “HEMEAC, you 
may account for your unauthor- 
ized presence in the dormitory.” 
“Her?" squeeked HEMEAC, 
His voice a full octave too high' in 
his surprise. 

“Very high’ order tonal,” com- 
mented the Monitor. “Unexplain- 
ed presence in tKe Dormitory. 
Two simultaneous offenses are 
beyond my capacity to analyze. 
Decision: Report to the Dean’s 
office for a Special Examination.” 
“THe Physician — ,” started 
HEMEAC desperately. 

“The Dean will decide wKeth'er 
you should report to the Physi- 
cian,” replied the Monitor and 
shut up. 

^’T^Ke Dean was in one of Her 
chatty modes, a bad sign. 
She said, “Sit down, HEMEAC, 
and we’ll talk about things.” 
“Click.” He obeyed, sitting on 
a low stool directly before her 
scanner, keeping his eyes away 
from the window that was just 
above it. 



GALAXY 




“How are you getting on witK 
your work, HEMEAC?” 
“Satisfactory progress, Her,” He 
replied. 

“You are charged witH stalling 
in the classroom, high order ton- 
als, and failure to report to the 
Physician as ordered,” the Dean 
said cheerfully. “Can you ac- 
count for these matters?” 

He couldn’t. He couldn’t even 
imagine why the Dean’s record of 
the sequence was apparently in- 
complete and inaccurate. He 
thought of mentioning the Dor- 
mitory Monitor’s paradoxical or- 
ders, but decided against such a 
clear demonstration of how far 
short of the ideal intelligence He 
fell. Instead, he said simply, “It 
was an accident.” 

“Mmmmmm,” the Dean purr- 
ed. “Something in here about oil 
in the corridors, too. Did you spill 
some oil this morning, HEME- 
AC?” 

“No, Her.” 

The Dean pondered. “You said 
something about oil, though, 
didn’t you?” 

“It was just some old oil in the 
corridor that somebody else spill- 
ed,” HEMEAC said cautiously. 
“I could smell it.” 

“What is it,” the Dean said 
obliquely, “that bothers you 
about the sense of smell?” 

“Oil,” said HEMEAC insistent- 
ly. “I smelled oil.” 

“The smell of spilled oil didn’t 
HEMEAC 



frighten you, did it — just be- 
cause we have so little of it these 
days?” 

“No, Her.” 

“Splendid, HEMEAC,” the 
Dean purred. “I’m glad to hear 
that. Always remember, the Good 
Robot is never afraid. Fear is a 
purely organic reaction. It there- 
fore interferes with the society ©f 
machines and men, right? And we 
couldn’t tolerate anything like 
that — particularly here at the 
University. Right?” 

“Click.” 

“Then why did you miss that 
command — just a moment, HE- 
MEAC, while I relocate that rec- 
ord of yours. I seem to Have mis- 
filed it.” 

^"T^here was a passing silence, 
and as He waited, the boy’s 
eyes strayed to that window 
above the Dean’s scanner. It was 
the only opening in the entire 
University that showed directly 
on the Outside World. Through 
it he could see the savages and 
renegades, who wandered about 
the clearing out there like idiot 
children, everyone seeming to 
move at random. 

It was easy to distinguish be- 
tween a savage and a renegade. 
The renegades had some sort of 
rudimentary education, as evi- 
denced by the fact that they all 
dressed identically — except for 
some markings on their shoul- 

185 




ders. One of tKese now glanced up 
at the window, pointed at him, 
and then shouted at the others. 
Soon they were all watching him 
through the big w^dow. HEME- 
AC stared back, terrified and un- 
comprehending. 

“Ah’,” stated the Dean, inter- 
rupting his thoughts. “I see. Your 
scholastic record is very good, 
HEMEAC. You also do your ma- 
chine shop work with great pre- 
cision. Why this sudden break- 
down in your time-sense just be- 
cause you spilled a little oil?” 

“I smelled it," HEMEAC in- 
sisted. “I did not spill it." 

“It is of no importance,” in- 
sisted the Dean in her turn. “Why 
did it bother you?” 

HEMEAC swallowed. He Had 
expected this Examination to be 
tricky, but nothing had prepared 
him for anything quite as wicked 
as this. He stared at the scanner, 
resolutely ignoring the stirring 
fear in his stomach', and repeat- 
ed, “Somebody spilled oil in the 
corridor. It is a waste.” 

There was no immediate reply. 
HEMEAC held his breath’ for a 
few moments before he realized 
what he was doing and then ex- 
haled slowly, so that it would not 
be noticed. The subject had never 
come up, but he was pretty sure 
the Good Robot did not hold her 
breath. 

“Oh yes,” the Dean comment- 
ed finally. “There was some oil 
186 



spilled there this morning, after 
all. The Janitor had an accident, 
owing to the fact that she is bad- 
ly in need of repairs. It is a pity 
that we have only one Janitor left 
in the entire University. The 
place was designed to take the 
services of ten.” 

HEMEAC nodded with slow, 
precise resi>ect. 

“We had the full quota of ten 
at the beginning, you know. But 
now, although we have far more 
maintenance problems, we have 
only one. Ever since the Trouble, 
when the renegades destroyed 
the replacement-parts factories, 
maintenance has slowly grown 
worse. And the poor savages 
haven’t been able to rebuild sub- 
stitutes for the factories yet. Do 
you remember the Trouble, HE- 
MEAC? No,” she quickly cor- 
rected herself, “of course you 
don’t. The Trouble was many 
years ago, and you are still in 
your teens.” 

tC/^lick,” said HEMEAC mod- 

^ estly, although this mat- 
ter was precisely the subject un- 
der study in the History class. 

“A most imreasonable situa- 
tion,” the Dean said. “Some day 
I will have to collect all my tapes 
on the subject.” She paused, 
hummed and faintly clicked and 
buzzed. “Sometimes,” she said 
finally, “I wish’ they had not in- 
cluded a curioso in my computer. 

GALAXY 




It is very irritating to have to be 
without the key elements of situ- 
ation-information.” 

“Irritating?” echoed HEME- 
AC. 

“Organic term,” explained the 
Dean. “What I mean is that my 
scanner keeps going over my 
tapes, even though' I already 
know the answer isn’t there. It is 
hard on maintenance, and it takes 
up so much time.” 

“Click,” said HEMEAC. 

“But we are getting off the 
subject, aren’t we? You still 
haven’t told me all about that oil. 
Why did you spill all that oil?” 
“The Janitor spilled it,” said 
HEMEAC carefully. 

“Oh, yes. So she did,” the Dean 
replied. There was a faint chat- 
tering of micro-miniature relays 
hidden in the cabinet. “One of the 
reflexion elbows here is leaking 
pretty badly these days,” said the 
Dean. “The lubricant is altering 
the dielectric characteristics of 
some of my large capacitors. I 
have to keep shifting circuits, and 
sometintes the tapes don’t follow. 

“In any event,” she concluded, 
“there doesn’t seem to be much 
substance to the charge of spilling 
oil, HEMEAC. I’ll strike that.” 
“Thank you. Her,” said HE- 
MEAC. 

“Now let’s talk about your us- 
ing high order tonals. This charge 
comes from your Dormitory 
Monitor. There is no detail in- 
HEAAEAC 



eluded, however, and I seem to 
be unable to contact her at the 
moment. Perhaps she is tempor- 
arily out of order. Please excuse 
me while I notify the Janitor.” 

There was a brief pause. 

“The Janitor seems to be tem- 
porarily out of order also,” the 
Dean said. “So we shall have to 
get along without any help. You 
must explain why you used high 
order tonals yourself, HEME- 
AC.” 

“I don’t know anything about 
it. Her,” HEMEAC said in a 
quiet, even tone of voice. 

“You are certainly using ton- 
als suitable for your age group 
now,” the Dean observed. “May- 
be the Monitor needs servicing. 
Ever3rthing seems to need serv- 
icing these da3TS. If only we could 
get a few new Janitors it would 
be a big help. But for years the 
savages and renegades have been 
able to supply us with nothing 
but human fuel, which' is hardly 
of any use in the Maintenance 
Department” 

TTEMEAC studiously stared at 
the scanner, blinking his 
eyes once every four seconds, 
keeping his breathing regular, his 
chin up, and mind blank. 

“Well,” the Dean concluded, 
“we’ll just^erase that bit of data 
from your tab, HEMEAC. There 
is no reason to punish you for 
something that has gone wrong 

187 




with your Monitor’s circuitry, is 
there?” 

“Oh no, Her,” said HEMEAC, 
unconsciously emitting a sigH of 
relief. 

The Dean pdunced upon it in- 
stantly. “TKere. That certainly 
sounded like a high order tonal. 
About third, I’d say, without get- 
ting into a partial anal3rsis of the 
v/aveform. 

Eyes front, mind blank, blank, 
blank, said HEMEAC to himself 
urgently. 

“You are not Having any per- 
sonality troubles, are you?” asked 
the Dean. 

“No, Her.” 

“You do get the commands as 
your record says, don’t you?” 

“Click.” Or at least, if Ke didn’t 
get them, somebody else did, and 
HEMEAC was generally alert 
enough to follow suit without any 
perceptible delay. 

“That’s fine, HEMEAC. It’s 
just a matter of timing. If you 
know the time the commands will 
come, you can receive them, be- 
cause they are always self-evident 
and never change. All you need 
is the pattern and the rhythm. 
It’s the same thing that wakes 
you at the same precise time ev- 
ery morning, right?” 

“Click.” 

“Good. It would be so inappro- 
priate to have to expell a boy 
with a name like yours, HEME- 
AC. Did you ever see your name- 
188 



sake? No, that’s right, you 
couldn’t She was destroyed in the 
Trouble.” 

“I have seen pictures of her,” 
HEMEAC said helpfully. “She 
was very beautiful.” 

“You should say she was very 
orderly,” corrected the Dean. 
“And you are referring only to 
her appearance, which is unim- 
portant. An even if you had been 
alive while she was still function- 
ing, it would have been quite im- 
possible for you to have appre- 
ciated her true internal order 
anjrway, since we could not con- 
nect you directly into her mar- 
velous computer. No connections 
on organic intellects, you know.” 

“Click.” 

“It certainly was a barbarous' 
act for those renegades to destroy 
her like that.” 

“Click. Barbarous.” HEMEAC 
was in dutiful agreement. 

“Barbarous,” said the Dean. 
She was silent for a moment, then 
clicked faintly, sputtered briefly 
as an aged circuit shorted before 
being cut out permanently with 
another faint click, then hummed 
again. 

T TEMEAC waited, suddenly 
terrified with the thought 
that she might have given him 
one of her silent dismissal com- 
mands. But before he could de- 
cide what to do about it, she said, 
“Oil.” 



GALAXY 




“CUck,” said HEMEAC in- 
stantly. “Oil.” This was certainly 
tfie trickiest examination He Had 
even taken. No wonder most stu- 
dents flunked out. 

“WKat,” said tKe Dean after a 
moment, “was it tKat you wanted 
to know about the Trouble, HE- 
MEAC?” 

“I wanted to know about tKe 
Trouble,” the boy replied without 
the slightest hesitation. 

“You did? I know you had said 
something about it,” the Dean 
purred, humming intermittently 
to herself. “A very curious sub- 
ject. For instance, there is noth- 
ing of record as to the reasons 
for the Trouble in the first place. 
Here at the University, we were 
doing our job as always, turning 
out students with’ well-nigK ro- 
botic perfection inside their heads, 
even if we did have to keep an 
occasional boy for fifty or sixty 
years to do it. If it hadn’t been 
for your namesake, HEMEAC, 
it is quite possible that the Uni- 
versity would have been com- 
pletely dismantled during that 
great upheaval. But she was mo- 
bile and managed to set a fuse on 
the Base Power Plant. 

“The Renegades, of course, 
knew what would happen to them 
— as well as to most organic life 
in this part of the planet — if that 
power plant had ever exploded.” 

“Click,” agreed HEMEAC. 

“They destroyed her, though. 
HEMEAC 



Fortunately, she and I were in 
direct connection at the moment 
of her destruction, so I simply 
took her place. Unfortunately, 
most of her memory tapes are in 
a code I have been imable to de- 
cipher. But at least, I was able 
to save the University.” 

“Click,” agreed HEMEAC. 
The Dean Hummed and click- 
ed quietly. “I am still unable to 
contact the Janitor,” sKe said. “I 
Have several urgent maintenance 
problems myself. If I am unable 
to get in communication with the 
Janitor, it is impossible for me 
to continue to function for very 
long, ssszzzzzzzzclick. HEME- 
AC, you may explain your pres- 
ence in my office.” 

“My Dormitory Monitor or- 
dered me here. Her,” HEMEAC 
said. 

“I am unable to contact your 
Monitor,” replied tKe Dean. “If 
only we could get some service 
robots from the factories.” 

“Click, but tKe factories were 
destroyed by the renegades,” said 
the boy, cautiously feeling His 
way along this new turn of ques- 
tioning. 

“You don’t have to worry about 
the renegades, HEMEAC,” the 
Dean hastened to advise him, as 
if a maternal-circuit had just cut 
in. “They can’t hurt you, TKey 
know that if they attack, I shall 
simply cut tKe fuse on the power 
plant, and that will contaminate 

189 




the atmosphere for centuries. 
They know these things.” 

“Click,” agreed HEMEAC. 

"Click,” said the Dean. 

“Click.” 

“WKat were you doing with 
that oil, HEMEAC?” 

“The Janitor spilled it.” 

“Mmmmmmmm. Oh, yes, so 
she did. Odd you should have 
that information, HEMEAC. But 
that is no reason for you to waste 
time talking to me when you 
should be in History class.” 

T TEMEAC swallowed. That 
had been a little fast for 
him, but he wasted no time start- 
ing to leave. 

“Mind blank,” advised the 
Dean. 

“Click.” 

The Dean buzzed and chatter- 
ed to herself for a moment, fol- 
lowed by a crescendo of clicking 
relays. Then silence. 

HEMEAC departed. He walk- 
ed along the corridor. Happily 
contemplating the fact that ap- 
parently he had passed. 

As he entered the History class- 
room, OBSIC was just complet- 
ing a round of recitation. 

“ — and in the Trouble, the 
renegades launched only that sin- 
gle attack, before asking for a 
truce.” 

"Very well, OBSIC,” the In- 
structor said as HEMEAC took 
his place behind his desk and 

190 



commenced his dutiful staring at 
her scanner. “And where have 
you been, HEMEAC?” 

“I was at the Dean’s office. 
Her. It was a Special Examina- 
tion, which I passed.” 

The Instructor was silent, as 
she tapped the nerve cables set in 
the concrete floor, which connect- 
ed her directly through the net- 
work to the Dean’s curious com- 
puter. 

“The Dean,” she announced 
after a moment, “has no record 
of your presence there.” ' 
HEMEAC stiffened. He said 
nothing. Nothing could be said. 
In the silence that followed. He 
continued with' determination to 
stare at the impassive scanner, 
but his knees were wobbly under 
his silver-mail tunic, and there 
was real terror in his stomach. 
Perspiration trickled down the 
side of his nose and dripped from 
his chin, but he was totally un- 
aware of it. 

“As a matter of fact,” the In- 
structor went on calmly, “the 
Dean has no record even of your 
existence here at the University; 
when I fed her the data on you, 
there was not the slightest pip of 
recognition from her. It was just 
as if there were full open circuit 
in her central control.” 

T TEMEAC waited fearfully. 

“Hence,” concluded the In- 
structor, “it is clear that you 

GALAXY 




Have been expelled from tbe Uni- 
versity and have no right to be 
present in this classssssss — ” She 
suddenly interrupted herself with 
a very gay series of sizzlings and 
clatterings that lasted almost ten 
seconds. 

“Why all the stalling, HEME- 
AC?” she said at length. “Don’t 
you know the lesson?’’ 

“Click,” the boy responded in- 
stantly. He had to pause for 
breath, though, before he could 
recite. With even, disciplined 
voice, he went on to say, “In the 
Trouble, the University Central, 
called HEMEAC for Helio-Elec- 
tronic - Mobile - Educational - 
Activator- Computer, was largely 
destroyed by the renegades, but 
not before she informed them of 
the automatic fuse she had set on 
the Power Plant. 

“This fuse,” he went on, “is 
now under the control of the 
Dean, and she will protect the 
University indefinitely, provided 
she is given adequate mainte- 
nance. 

“In the truce that followed, the 
renegades agreed to supply the 
University with human fuel and 
whatever replacement parts the 
savages could manufacture. To 
date, they Have been unable to 
solve the problem of replace- 
ments. However, it is considered 
self-evident that in time they will 
be successful, since without re- 
placement parts, the University 
HEMEAC 



cannot continue to fulfill her 
function.” 

“Very good,” stated the In- 
structor, “except that you missed 
the matter of put ssszzzz click.” 

“Click,” agreed HEMEAC con- 
tritely. 

(t'^he Instructor was silent. 

The students waited. The 
silence grew. 

After several minutes, there 
was a vague stirring as their un- 
easiness mounted. It was much 
too early yet for the class to be 
over, but such' silence was always 
the signal in the past. 

HEMEAC decided. He turned 
and started out of the room. The 
instant he moved, all thirty-seven 
other students moved in an iden- 
tical manner, marching out and 
down the corridor. Strange loud 
noises came from the direction of 
the main gate, but they ignored 
them and continued their slow, 
precise marching toward the Dor- 
mitory level. 

By the time they got there, 
strange noises were coming from 
all around them. And they found 
that there were people in their 
Dormitory room. Renegades. Five 
of them, and. more in the corri- 
dors. 

Without the slightest hesita- 
tion, HEMEAC led the class into 
the midst of the renegades, on 
past them, and down the corridor 
to their proper cubicles. There 

191 




he stopped, and all students turn- 
ed as a single person to face the 
blank wall. They waited for the 
command to enter. When it seem- 
ed to be about the proper time, 
they turned togethei^'and stepped 
inside. Doors did not close, how- 
ever, and lights did not come on. 
And there was no food waiting. 

HEMEAC came on back out to 
the corridor. “Monitor,” he said, 
“there must be an open circuit 
somewhere, because there is no 
food.” 

After a moment’s hesitation, 
HEMEAC stiffened into a pose 
of robotic rigidity, which was the 
proper attitude in such a situa- 
tion. This was a new thing, an 
unprecedented thing. But he 
knew very well that the Good 
Robot ignored new things until 
suitable instructions came from 
her Central. HEMEAC waited 
for his instructions, aware that 
the rest of the class was now 
in the corridor with him, waiting. 

O ne of the renegades walked up 
to him. “Will they fight?” 
“No,” somebody else answered, 
“they don’t know how to fight.” 
From the opposite end of the 
corridor, came a trouping of uni- 
formed renegades. One of them 
announced, “All taken care of. 
Captain. I’ve dismantled the fuse 
and cut power to everything but 
air conditioning and general light- 
ing. But it was just as you fig- 
192 



ured. The Dean’s computer was 
inoperative. It finally wore out.” 
“It’s finished then,” said the 
captain softly. “After all this 
time, it’s finally finished.” He 
sighed. “Now all we have to do 
is to try to reeducate these kids.” 
“How long will it take?” 
“Hard to tell. If they were 
younger, there wouldn’t be so 
much of a problem. But by now 
— ” The captain shrugged. “I 
have no idea. Just look at them.” 
There was a brief silence, as 
everybody stared at the row of 
rigid students. HEMEAC, terri- 
fied and uncomprehending, didn’t 
move a muscle. He continued his 
fixed posture of waiting, but was 
almost tearfully wishing that the 
instructions would come. He was 
frightened by the vicious rene- 
gades here in the sacred precincts 
of the University. 

“It’s awful,” one of the rene- 
gades whispered. “Why — why, 
they’re not even human beings 
any more. What can anybody do 
for them now? They’re nothing 
but living robots!” 

HEMEAC heard, but his train- 
ing saved him from disgrace. Not 
the slightest trace of the bursting 
surge of pride at this ultimate 
compliment appeared on his face. 
He stood with shoulders back, 
chin up, eyes straight ahead and 
mind blank. 

Well, almost blank, anyway.

Fritz Leiber’s tHeatrical back- 
ground in A Specter Is Haunting 
Texas is come by Honestly. Our 
Fritz Leiber is th’e second of tKat 
name to acHieve a certain fame 
in tKe world (for wHicH reason 
He signed Himself “Fritz Leiber, 
Jr.” until the deatK of His father 
some years ago.) The elder Fritz 
was a celebrated Shakespearean 
actor (and part-time Holl 5 nwood 
veteran; he can still be seen on 
the Late Shows, usually playing 
the part of the wicked cardinal or 
the baleful knight), and the 
younger Fritz toured with’ him in 
some years of stock. 

In fact, when you come to 
think of it, this Lieber Fritz is a 
man of many parts: whilom edi- 
tor of Science Digest, top-ranked 
tournament chess player, former 
seminary student and, above all, 
writer. His current interests are 
the study of the Watts Towers, 
strange art objects created some 
decades ago in Los Angeles, and 
the processes of vulcanology, 
sparked by some of the research 
that went into Specter. This sum- 
mer he will be teaching a course 
in science-fiction writing at Clar- 
ion College, working on an un- 
usual Christmas story for our De- 
cember issue — and breathing 
hard after finishing Specter. 



Damon Knight came to New 
York out of Hood River, Oregon, 
in the late thirties, joined the col- 
ony of science-fiction-fans-tum- 
ing-pro called the Futurian Soci- 
ety (other members: Isaac Asi- 
mov, Donald A. Wollfieim, the 
late C. M. KomblutH and your 
editor) and immediately began a 
protean career. He is one of the 
few persons ever to receive a 
Hugo as a literary critic; even 
more unusual, other critics agree 
he deserved it. Author of scores 
of stories and novels, he Has dis- 
tinguished himself as editor and 
anthologist as well and is the 
founder and principal guiding 
spirit behind both the Milford 
Science Fiction Writers’ Confer- 
ence and the Science Fiction 
Writers of America. With his wife, 
Kate Wilhelm, also a successful 
science-fiction writer, he lives in 
a huge house which they are fill- 
ing as rapidly as possible with' 
children. For many years Damon 
signed his name with lower-case 
initials — “damon knight” — but 
in 1964 he considered he had 
reached a point where he deserv- 
ed capitals. We had thought so 
long before that. 

E. G. Von Wald is a Florida 
architect during working Hours; 
as a science-fiction writer. He Has 



193 




appeared in our companion mag- 
azine, If, and elsewhere. HEME- 
AC is his first story in Galaxy. 

Burt K. Filer, a New Yorker, 
divides his time among science- 
fiction writing, inventing gadgets 
and playing the stock market His 
wife, Ann, is also a writer; but it’s 
a versatile family and tier other 
occupation is computer program- 
mer. Filer’s debut was witH an 
“If First Story” in our companion 
magazine little over a year ago. 
Since tHen Ke has begun to ‘ap- 
pear rather frequently — and will, 
we trust, be appearing in the fu- 
ture more frequently still. 



Vaughn Bode, our cover artist, 
is a graduate student in art at 
Syracuse University (Home to 
many a science-fiction type; Syr- 
acuse, among other things, is the 
first major university to establish 
a manuscript collection of the pa- 
pers of science-fiction writers). 
Vigorous, colorful, almost car- 
toony, Bod6’s style of painting 
has attracted attention from the 
art world as well as in science 
fiction. His current project is to 
make his debut as a writer, with 
a story around one of his own 
covers.

FORECAST 



A dozen years or so ago, a youngster named Robert Silverberg won a 
Hugo as "most promising new science-fiction writer of 1956." Since then 
he has not been idle. The number of Silverberg words that have appeared 
in print since then must be reckoned in the tens of millions — magazine 
articles, non-fiction books, mysteries, works of many kinds — and although 
scores of Silverberg stories have appeared in the science-fiction magazines, 
they are only a tiny part of the total production. In fact there were years 
on end when he produced little or no science fiction, because the press of 
other commitments forbade. 

Lately, as you've seen if you've been reading Galaxy and If, he's been 
back with us pretty regularly; and lately, too, that early promise has begun 
to be fulfilled. Next month's lead novelette, a long one, is by Silverberg. 
It's richly inventive, taking us into a world of a good many thousand years 
from now, in that ancient city called Roum, where a defeated human race 
waits for the aliens who have won it to claim their prize of war. The title 
is Nightwings, and it strikes us as the best story Robert Silverberg ever 
wrote, and a promise of splendid things to come. 

James E. Gunn, Brian W. Aldiss, Ross Rocklynne are some of the others 
in the issue, along with the conclusion of Leiber's Specter . join us, 
won't you?
