THOUGHT FOR FOOD 
"C 1 ROM the editorial point of 
view, humanity has two cardinal sins: excessive pessimism and 
excessive optimism. These sins are 
cardinal because, editorially speaking, they are the least original. 
An easy way of testing that statement— aside from how to do it — 
would be to take a pair of science 
fiction writers from the late 19th 
century, plunge them into a modern 
supermarket to simmer for one 
hour, then return them to their own 
shells and let come to a boil. 
One would manufacture a Utopia of ready-made foods; the other 
would see only a blight of mechanized feeding. 
Both, of course, would be partly 
right, demonstrating once more 
that few things are all advantage or 
disadvantage. Anything that frees 
women of 16 hours a day over 
cranky wood or coal ranges must 
be rated an advantage, especially 
when variety is so immensely increased and packaging is so much 
more attractive, sanitary and, by 
law, honest. On the other hand, the 
mixes and instants and suchlike are 
pretty much dried cuds from mechanical stomachs, the precooked 
meals are more industrial engineering than cookery, and the spread 
between farm and retail price is 
almost as wide as between farm and 
restaurant. 
Given time to visit a bookstore, 
our ancestral authors would want 
only to see if their own books were 
still around, and then perhaps a 
dazzled skimming of volumes on 
science and history. Chances are 
they wouldn’t get to the cookbook 
shelves at all. 
A shame— they’d be missing two 
big gold-stamped tomes, handsomely slipcased, prodigiously illustrated with color photographs of 
foods and settings and naperies of 
a beauty no painter has ever 
matched, and literally thousands of 
recipes that would tempt a Gandhi 
off his most passively resistant fast. 
Few of these very many recipes 
could have been followed everywhere at any time of the year in the 
19th century. But the same techniques that give us culinary horrors like vacuum-packed chocolate
covered ants and frozen messtray 
meals also free us of geography and 
the seasons. 
Vkf/’ITH all the world’s pastures 
’ ’ and fisheries, dairies, groves 
and gardens to draw upon, one has 
need of all the world’s recipes, and 
here they are in orderly profusion : 
Hors-d’oeuvre, smorgasbord, antipasto, Chinese egg rolls, enchiladas — ah, Turkish beurrecks: Cut 
Vi pound Gruyere cheese into 
small pieces and place them in a 
saucepan with a generous Vi cup 
very thick white sauce. Stir until 
the cheese is melted and the sauce 
thickens. Spread on a platter to 
cool and then shape into small 
sausages. Wrap each sausage shape 
in plain pastry and fry in hot deep 
oil (385 F.) to a light goldenbrown. 
“Time was,” says this overlord 
of kitchen texts, “when the baker 
of inferior bread could be publicly 
whipped, or have his ears nailed to 
a post, or be pilloried with the offending loaf hung around his neck.” 
Until this worthy practice is revived, here are recipes for splendid 
bread and rolls. 
And soups, from every sort of 
consomme to creams to game soups 
and broths — ah, and egg bisque 
Biarritz : Reduce 3 quarts fish stock 
to Vi its volume over a bright flame. 
Add 6 egg yolks beaten into 1 cup 
sweet cream and stir over a low 
flame until the mixture thickens. 
Season with salt, white pepper, and 
freshly grated nutmeg. When ready 
to serve, strain the soup through a 
fine muslin cloth into a heated soup 
tureen and add a generous Vi cup 
cooked, flaked crab meat. Sprinkle 
over the soup 1 tablespoon finely 
chopped chervil (or parsley — 
HLG ) and Vi teaspoon finely 
chopped tarragon and serve at 
once with croutons. 
Eggs? All the standard ways, and 
stuffed, fried, egg pie, au gratin, and 
more poaches than one might 
imagine, like — ah, eggs Benedict: 
Split and toast English muffins, allowing two halves for each serving. 
Cover each muffin half with a slice 
of broiled or sauteed aged ham or 
Canadian back bacon and top with 
a poached egg. Pour over 1 tablespoon hollandaise sauce and serve 
hot. ( Anyone who buys hollandaise 
sauce or fakes it the way mayonnaise makers suggest isn’t a criminal on the grand scale of today’s 
perpetrators of pallid breads; one 
ear nailed to a post should be sufficient punishment — HLG.) 
Dairy products, fresh vegetables 
and fruits, fish and shellfish— here 
is where modem techniques repeal 
distance and the seasons — only to 
have cruel and inhuman treatment 
dished, not to mention meted, out 
to these rich boons. Here are 
French and Chinese and Scandinavian and New England and Javanese and other ways of unlocking 
these treasures, such as— ah, paella: 
THOUGHT FOR FOOD 
Cut a plump chicken into serving 
pieces and saute the pieces in V 2 
cup butter with 1 crushed clove of 
garlic until the chicken is golden 
brown on all sides. Remove and set 
aside the chicken and in the juices 
remaining in the pan saute 2 cups 
rice until it is golden. Add V 2 teaspoon saffron and 4 cups hot 
chicken stock and cook over a very 
low flame until the liquid is absorbed. The rice will be only partially cooked. 
Butter the bottom and sides of 
a deep casserole or Dutch oven. Put 
half the pieces of chicken in the 
casserole, and cover the chicken 
with 1 lobster, cut into pieces, 1 
dozen shelled shrimp, 1 dozen mussels, 1 chorizo, the highly seasoned 
Spanish sausage, sliced (or any hot 
sausage — HLG ) and V 2 cup diced 
pimentos. Add almost all the rice 
and top with the remaining pieces 
of chicken. Cover the chicken exactly as before, with lobster, shrimp, 
mussels, chorizo, and pimentos. 
Add the rest of the rice and bake 
the casserole, uncovered, in a moderate oven (350 F.) for 45 minutes, adding a little chicken stock 
from time to time if needed . 
steamed clams may be used in the 
paella in place of, or in addition to, 
the mussels. 
T) REFER home whipped cream 
to commercial lather? Try kaymak, the Near Eastern clotted 
cream which makes even home 
whipped cream taste like spineless 
froth: Bring 1 quart heavy cream 
to a boil in a large kettle, over very 
slow heat. Lift a ladleful of the 
cream out of the kettle and pour it 
back from a height, to make as 
many bubbles as possible. Continue 
this process for 30 minutes to 1 
hour, until the pan is full of cream 
bubbles. Put the kettle in a warm 
place for 2 hours, then chill the 
cream well. The cream that sets on 
top of the liquid is the kaymak; it 
may be spooned off or cut off with a 
sharp knife and served in slices. 
{Use it exactly the way you would 
whipped cream — HLG . ) 
Only halfway through the first 
volume, with two brief dips into 
the second, and no room for any 
sample recipes of the meat and 
vegetable dishes, the aspics and 
preserves and sauces, the souffles 
and omelets and salads, cakes and 
puddings and pastries — dishes by 
the thousands, menu combinations 
by the million. 
The title of this gastronomical 
Fort Knox? It’s The Gourmet 
Cookbook, a record of terrestrial 
cookery that should be in every 
micro-library on every world we 
colonize. The strange foods and 
seasonings we find there will seem 
less strange when checked — and 
cooked — against the vast variety 
listed herein. The $25 price isn’t 
high for being the best cook in 
town — or among the stars.

I can't stand the Andy Carter grouches who hate having alien 
M A and Pa were fighting 
again, not really mad 
at one another, but arguing pretty loud. They had been at 
it, off and on, for weeks. 
“We just can’t up and leave!” 
said Ma. ‘We have to think it out. 
We can’t pull up and leave a 
place we’ve lived in all our lives 
without some thinking on it!” 
“I have thought on it!” Pa said. 
“I’ve thought on it a lot! All these 
aliens moving in. There was a 
brood of new ones moved onto 
the Pierce place just a day or two 
ago.” 
“How do you know,” asked 
Ma, “that you’ll like one of the 
Homestead Planets once you settle on it? It might be worse than 
Earth.” 
“We can’t be any more unlucky 
there than we been right here! 
There ain’t anything gone right. I 
don’t mind telling you I am plumb 
discouraged.” 
And Pa sure-God was right 
about how unlucky we had been. 
The tomato crop had failed and 
two of the cows had died and a 
bear had robbed the bees and 
busted up the hives and the tractor had broken down and cost 
$78.90 to get fixed.

By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK

NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
Ma argued. “You’d have it no 
matter where you go.” 
“Andy Carter doesn’t have bad 
luck!” yelled Pa. “I don’t know 
how he does it, but everything he 
does, it turns out to a hair. He 
could fall down in a puddle and 
come up dripping diamonds!” 
“I don’t know,” said Ma philosophically. “We got enough to eat 
and clothes to cover us and a roof 
above our head. Maybe that’s as 
much as anyone can expect these 
days.” 
“It ain’t enough,” Pa said. “A 
man shouldn’t be content to just 
scrape along. I lay awake at night 
to figure out how I can manage 
better. I’ve laid out plans that 
should by rights have worked. But 
they never did. Like the time we 
tried that new adapted pea from 
Mars down on the bottom forty. 
It was sandy soil and they should 
have grown there. They ain’t 
worth a damn on any land that 
will grow another thing. And that 
land was worthless; it should have 
been just right for those Martian 
peas. But I ask you, did they grow 
there?” 
“No,” said Ma, “now that I 
recollect, they didn’t.” 
“And the next year, what happens? Andy Carter plants the 
same kind of peas just across the 
fence from where I tried to grow 
them. Same kind of land and all. 
And Andy gets bow-legged hauling those peas home.” 
VW/’HAT Pa said was true. He was 
’ ’ a better farmer than Andy 
Carter could ever hope to be. And 
he was smarter, too. But let Pa try 
a thing and bad luck would beat 
him out. Let Andy try the same 
and it always went right. 
And it wasn’t Pa alone. It was 
the entire neighborhood. Everybody was just plain unlucky, except Andy Carter. 
“I tell you,” Pa swore, “just one 
more piece of bad luck and we’ll 
throw in our hand and start over 
somewhere fresh. And the Homestead Planets seem the best to 
me. Why, you take ...” 
I didn’t wait to hear any more. 
I knew it would go on the way 
it always had. So I snuck out without their seeing me and went 
down the road, and as I walked 
along, I worried that maybe one 
of these days they might make up 
their mind to move to one of the 
Homestead Planets. There had 
been an awful lot of our old 
neighbors who’d done exactly that. 
It might be all right to emigrate, 
of course, but whenever I thought 
about it, I got a funny feeling at 
the thought of leaving Earth. 
Those other planets were so awful far away, one wouldn’t have 
much chance of getting back again 
if he didn’t like them. And all my 
friends were right in the neighborhood, and they were pretty good 
friends even if they were all aliens. 
I got a little start when I 
thought of that. It was the first 
time it had occurred to me that 
they all were aliens. I had so much 
fun with them, I’d never thought 
of it. 
It seemed a little queer to me 
that Ma and Pa should be talking 
about leaving Earth when all the 
farms that had been sold in our 
neighborhood had been bought up 
by aliens. The Homestead Planets 
weren’t open to the aliens and that 
might be the reason they came to 
Earth. If they’d had a choice, maybe they would have gone to one 
of the Homesteads instead of settling down on Earth. 
I walked past the Carter place 
and saw that the trees in the orchard were loaded down with fruit 
and I figured that some of us could 
sneak in and steal some of it when 
it got ripe. But we’d have to be 
careful, because Andy Carter was 
a stinker, and his hired man, Ozzie 
Burns, wasn’t one bit better. I remembered the time we had been 
stealing watermelons and Andy 
had found us at it and I’d got 
caught in a barbed-wire fence 
when we ran away. Andy had walloped me, which was all right. But 
there’d been no call for him going 
to Pa and collecting seven dollars for the few melons we had 
stolen. Pa had paid up and then 
he’d walloped me again, worse 
than Andy did. 
And after it was over, Pa had 
said bitterly that Andy was no 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
great shakes of a neighbor. And 
Pa was right. He wasn’t. 
T GOT down to the old Adams 
place and Fancy Pants was out 
in the yard, just floating there and 
bouncing that old basketball of 
his. 
We call him Fancy Pants because we can’t pronounce his 
name. Some of these alien people 
have very funny names. 
Fancy Pants was all dressed up 
as usual. He always is dressed up 
because he never gets the least bit 
dirty when he plays. Ma is always 
asking me why I can’t keep neat 
and clean like Fancy Pants. I tell 
her it would be easy if I could 
float along like him and never had 
to walk, and if I could throw mudballs like him without touching 
them. 
This Sunday morning he was 
dressed up in a sky-blue shirt that 
looked like silk, and red britches 
that looked as if they might be 
velvet, and he had a green bow 
tied around his yellow curls that 
floated in the breeze. At first 
glance, Fancy Pants looked something like a girl — but you better 
never say so, because he’d mop up 
the road with you. He did with me 
the first time I saw him. He didn’t 
even lay a hand on me while he 
was doing it, but sat up there, 
cross-legged, about three feet off 
the ground, smiling that sweet 
smile of his on his ugly face, and 
with his yellow curls floating in 
the breeze. And the worst of it was 
that I couldn’t get back at him. 
But that was long ago and we 
were good friends now. 
We played catch for a while, 
but it wasn’t too much fun. 
Then Fancy Pants’ Pa came out 
of the house and he was glad to 
see me, too. He asked about the 
folks and wanted to know if the 
tractor was all right, now that 
we’d got it fixed. I answered him 
politely because I’m a little 
scared of Fancy Pants’ Pa. 
He is sort of spooky — not the 
way he looks, the way he does 
things. From the looks of him, he 
wasn’t meant to be a farmer, but 
he does all right at it. He doesn’t 
use a plow to plow a field. He 
just sits cross-legged in the air and 
floats up and down the field, and 
when he passes over a strip of 
ground, that strip of ground is 
plowed — and not only plowed, but 
raked and harrowed until it is as 
fine as face powder. He does all his 
work that way. There aren’t any 
weeds in any of his crops, for he 
just sails up and down the rows and 
the weeds come out slick and clean, 
with the roots intact, to lie on the 
ground and wither. 
It doesn’t take too much imagination to see what a guy like that 
could do if he ever caught a kid 
in any sort of mischief, so all of 
us are thoughtful and polite whenever he’s around. 
So I told him how we’d got the 
tractor all fixed up and about the 
bear busting up the bee hives. 
Then I asked him about his time 
machine and he shook his head 
real sad. 
“I don’t know what’s the matter, 
Steve,” he said. “I put things into 
it and they disappear, and I should 
find them later, but I never have. 
If I’m moving them in time, I’m 
perhaps pushing them too far.” 
He would have told me more 
about his time machine, but there 
was an interruption. 
While we had been talking, 
Fancy Pants’ Pa and me, the Fancy Pants dog had run a cat up a 
maple tree. That is the normal 
situation for any cat and dog— 
unless Fancy Pants is around. 
TT 1 OR Fancy Pants wasn’t one 
to leave a situation normal. 
He reached up into the tree — 
well, he didn’t reach up with his 
hands, of course, but with whatever he reaches with — and he 
nailed this cat and sort of bundled it up so it couldn’t move and 
brought it down to the ground. 
Then he held the dog so the 
dog couldn’t do more than twitch 
and he put that bundled-up cat 
down in front of the twitching dog, 
then let them loose with split-second timing. 
The two of them exploded into 
a blur of motion, with the weirdest 
uproar you ever heard. The cat 
made it to the tree in the fastest 
time and nearly took off the bark 
swarming up the trunk. And the 
dog miscalculated and failed to 
put on his brakes in time and 
banged smack into the tree spreadeagled. 
The cat by this time was up in 
the highest branches, hanging on 
and screaming, while the dog 
walked around in circles, acting 
kind of stunned. 
Fancy Pants’ Pa broke off what 
he was saying to me and he looked 
at Fancy Pants. He didn’t do or 
say a thing, but when he looked 
at Fancy Pants, Fancy Pants grew 
terribly pale and sort of wilted 
down. 
“Let that teach you,” said Fancy Pants’ Pa, “to leave those animals alone. You don’t see Steve 
here or Nature Boy mistreating 
them that way, do you?” 
“No, sir,” mumbled Fancy 
Pants. 
“And now get along, the two of 
you. You have things to do.” 
I got this to say for Fancy 
Pants’ Pa: he gives Fancy Pants 
his lickings, or whatever they may 
be, and then he forgets about it. 
He doesn’t keep on harping at it 
for the rest of the day. 
CO Fancy Pants and me went 
^ down the road, me shuffling 
along, kicking up the dust, and 
Fancy Pants floating along beside 
me. 
We got down to Nature Boy’s 
place and he was waiting out in 
front. I knew he had been hoping someone would come along. 
There were a couple of sparrows 
sitting on his shoulder and a rabbit hopping all around him and a 
chipmunk in the pocket of his 
pants, looking out at us with bright 
and beady eyes. 
Nature Boy and I sat down underneath a tree and Fancy Pants 
came as close as he ever does to 
sitting down — floating about three 
inches off the ground — and we 
talked about what we ought to do. 
Trouble was, there wasn’t really 
anything that needed any doing. 
So we sat there and talked and 
tossed pebbles and pulled stems 
of grass and put them in our 
mouths and chewed them, while 
Nature Boy’s pet wild things gamboled all around us and didn’t 
seem to be afraid at all. Except 
that they were a little leary of 
Fancy Pants. He is, when you 
come right down to it, a sort of 
sneaky rascal. Me they are fast 
friends with when I’m with Nature Boy, but let me meet them 
when I am alone and they keep 
their distance. 
I can see how wild things might 
take to Nature Boy. He is fur all 
over, real sleek, glossy fur, and he 
wears nothing but that little pair 
of pants. Turn him loose without 
those pants and someone would 
be bound to take a shot at him. 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
S O we sat there wondering what 
to do. Then I remembered 
that Pa had said a new family had 
moved onto the Pierce place and 
we decided to go down and see if 
they had any kids. 
We went down the road to the 
old Pierce place and it turned out 
there was one just about our age. 
He was a sort of runty little kid, 
with a peaked face and big round 
eyes and kind of eager look about 
him, like a stunted hoot owl. 
He told us his name and it was 
even worse than Nature Boy’s 
and Fancy Pants’ names, so we 
had a vote on it and decided we 
would call him Butch. That suited 
him just fine. 
Then he called out his family 
and they stood in a row, like a 
bunch of solemn, runty owls roosting on a limb, while he introduced 
them. There was his Ma and Pa 
and a little brother and a kid sister almost as big as he was. The 
rest of them went back into the 
house, but Butch’s Pa squatted 
down and began to talk with us. 
You could see from the way he 
talked that he was a little scared 
of this farming business. He admitted he really was no farmer, 
but an optical worker, and explained to us that an optical worker designed lenses and ground 
them. But, he said, there was no 
future in a job like that back on 
his old home planet. He told us 
how glad he was to be on Earth 
and how he wanted to be a good 
citizen and a good neighbor, and 
a lot of other things like that. 
When he started to run down, 
we got away from him. There ain’t 
anything more embarrassing than 
a crazy adult who likes to talk 
with kids. 
We decided that maybe we 
should show Butch around a bit 
and let him in on some of the 
things we had been doing. 
So we struck off down Dark 
Hollow and we didn’t make much 
time because all of these friends 
of Nature Boy were popping out 
to join him. Before very long, we 
were a sort of traveling menagerie 
— rabbits and chipmunks and a 
gopher or two and a couple of 
raccoons. 
I like Nature Boy, of course, 
and I’ve had some good times 
with him, but he has spoiled a 
lot of fun as well. Before he 
showed up in the neighborhood, I 
did a lot of fishing and hunting, 
but that is all spoiled now. I can’t 
shoot a squirrel or catch a fish 
without wondering if it is a friend 
of Nature Boy’s. 
After a while, we got down to 
the creek bed where we were digging out the lizard. We’d been 
at it all summer long and we 
hadn’t uncovered very much of 
him, but we still figured that some 
day we might get him all dug out. 
You understand that it wasn’t 
a live lizard we were digging out, 
but a lizard that had turned to 
stone a zillion years ago. 
There is a place where the 
stream runs down a limestone 
ledge and the limestone lies in 
layers. The lizard was between 
two of those layers. We’d got four 
or five feet of his tail uncovered. 
But the digging was getting harder, 
for we were working back into the 
limestone ledge and there was 
more of it to move. 
ANCY Pants floated up above 
the limestone ledge and got 
himself set as solid as he could. 
Sitting there, he hit that limestone 
ledge a tremendous whack, being 
very careful not to crack the lizard. 
It was one of his better whacks, 
busting up a lot of stone, and while 
Fancy Pants rested up to take another one, the three of us piled in 
and threw out the busted rock. 
But there was one big piece he 
had loosened up that we couldn’t 
move. 
“Hit it just a tap,” I told him. 
“Break it up a little and we can 
get it out.” 
“I got it loose,” he said. “It’s 
up to you to get it out.” 
There was no sense arguing 
with him. So the three of us 
wrestled at the rock, but we 
couldn’t budge it and Fancy Pants 
sat up there, fat and sassy, taking it easy and enjoying himself. 
“You ought to have a crowbar,” 
he told us. “If you had a crowbar, 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
you could pry that rock out.” 
I was getting sick and tired of 
Fancy Pants, and so, just to get 
away from him for a while, I said 
I’d go and fetch a crowbar. And 
this new kid, this Butch, said he’d 
go along with me. 
So we left Nature Boy and 
Fancy Pants and climbed up to 
the road and started out for my 
place. We didn’t hurry any. It 
would serve Fancy Pants right 
if he had to wait, and Nature Boy 
as well, for all his showing off 
with his animals. 
We walked along the road and 
talked. Butch told me about the 
planet he had come from and it 
sure was a poor-mouth place, and 
I told him about the neighborhood, and we were getting to be 
friends. 
We reached the Carter place 
and were walking past the orchard 
when Butch stopped dead in the 
middle of the road and went sort 
of stiff, like a- hunting dog will go 
when he scents a bird. 
I was walking right behind him 
and I bumped into him, but he 
just stood there with those eager 
eyes agleam and his entire body 
tense — so tense it seemed to 
quiver when it really didn’t. 
“What’s going on?” I asked. 
He kept on looking at something in the orchard. I took a look 
where he was looking and I 
couldn’t see a thing. 
Then he turned around like a 
flash and jumped the fence on the 
downhill side of the road and went 
lickety-split down across the field 
opposite the orchard. I jumped the 
fence and ran after him and caught 
him just before he reached the 
woods. I grabbed him by the shoulder and spun him around to face 
me. It wasn’t hard to do, he was 
such a spindly kid. 
“What’s the matter with you?” 
I hollered. “Where do you think 
you’re going?” 
“Home to get my gun!” 
“Your &un? What for?” 
“There’s a whole bunch of them 
up there! We have to clean them 
out!” 
He must have seen I didn’t understand. 
“Don’t tell me,” he said, “that 
you didn’t see them?” 
I shook my head. “There wasn’t 
anything there.” 
“They’re there, all right,” he 
said. “Maybe you can’t see them. 
Maybe you’re like old folks.” 
T'' HERE’S no one who can accuse me of a thing like that. I 
doubled up my fist and poked it 
underneath his nose. He hurried 
up to explain. 
“They’re things that only kids 
can see. And they bring bad luck. 
You can’t leave them around or 
you’ll have bad luck all the time.” 
I didn’t believe it right away. 
But after all the things I’d seen 
done by Nature Boy and Fancy 
Pants, you don’t ever catch me 
saying straight out that a thing’s 
impossible. 
And after I’d thought it over for 
a minute, it made a silly sort of 
sense. For the folks certainly had 
been plagued by hard luck for 
a long time now and it didn’t stand 
to reason that luck should be all 
bad and never any good unless 
there was something making it 
that way. 
And it wasn’t the folks alone, 
but all the other neighbors — all 
of them, of course, except Andy 
Carter, and Andy Carter was too 
mean to be bothered by bad luck. 
We were, I thought, sure a hardluck neighborhood. 
“All right,” I said to Butch. 
“Let’s go and get that gun.” 
And I was thinking even as I 
said it that it must be a funny 
kind of gun that would shoot a 
thing one couldn’t even see. 
We made it back to the old 
Pierce place in almost no time at 
all. Butch’s Pa was sitting out 
underneath a tree, feeling sorry for 
himself. Butch came up to him 
and started jabbering and I 
couldn’t understand a word. 
His Pa listened to him for a 
while and then broke in. “You 
should talk this planet’s language, 
son. It is most impolite to do 
otherwise. And you want to become a good citizen of this great 
and glorious planet, I am sure, 
and there’s no better way to do 
it than to talk its language and observe its customs and try to live 
the way its people do.” 
I’ll say this much for him: 
Butch’s Pa sure knew how to fling 
around the words. 
“Is it true, mister,” I asked him, 
“that these things can bring bad 
luck?” 
“Most assuredly,” said Butch’s 
Pa. “Back on our old home planet, 
we know them well.” 
“Pa,” asked Butch, “should I 
get my gun?” 
“Now I don’t know,” said his 
Pa. “It’s something we have to 
give some study. Back on our 
home planet, there would be no 
question of it. But this is a different planet and it may have different ways. It may be that the 
man who has these creatures 
would object to your shooting 
them.” 
“But there isn’t anyone really 
got them,” I declared. “How can 
you have a thing when you can’t 
even see it?” 
“I was thinking about the gentleman in whose orchard they appeared.” 
“You mean Andy Carter. He 
doesn’t know anything about 
them.” 
“That does not matter,” said 
Butch’s Pa, with a great deal of 
righteousness. “It becomes, it 
would seem to me, a quite deep 
problem in ethics. On our home 
planet, no man would want these 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
things; he’d be ashamed to have 
them. But here it might be different. They bring good luck, you 
see, to the ones that they adopt” 
“You mean they bring good 
luck to Andy?” I asked him. “But 
I thought you said that they 
brought bad luck.” 
“So they do,” said Butch’s Pa, 
“except to the ones that they 
adopt. To them they bring good 
luck, but bad luck to all the others. 
For it is an axiom that fortune for 
one man is misfortune for the 
rest. That is why we do not let 
them adopt any of us on our home 
planet.” 
“You think they have adopted 
Andy and that’s why he has good 
luck?” 
“You are most correct,” said 
Butch’s Pa. “You have admirably 
grasped the concept.” 
“Well, gee, why don’t we just 
go in and shoot them?” 
“This Carter gentleman would 
not object to your doing so?” 
“Of course he would, but that’s 
what you would expect of him. 
He’d probably run us off the place 
before we got the job half done, 
but we could sneak back again . .” 
“No,” Butch’s Pa said flat out. 
He was an awful stickler for 
doing the right thing, Butch’s Pa 
was — bound and determined he 
wasn’t going to get caught off base 
doing something wrong. 
“That is not the way to do,” 
he said. “It is most unethical. You 
think that if this Carter knew he 
had these things, he would want 
to keep them?” 
“I am sure he would. He doesn’t 
care for anybody but himself.” 
Butch’s Pa heaved a big sigh 
and crawled to his feet. “Young 
man, would your father be at 
home?” 
“He most likely would.” 
“We’ll go and talk with him,” 
he said. “He is a native of this 
planet and an honest man and he 
will tell us what is right.” 
“Mister,” I asked him, “what do 
you call these things?” 
“We have a name for them, but 
it does not translate into your 
tongue with anything like ease. We 
call them something that is neither 
here nor there, something that is 
halfway between. Halfling would 
be the word for it, if there is such 
a word.” 
“I don’t know if there is or not,” 
I said, “but it sounds right.” 
“Then,” decided Butch’s Pa, 
“for sheer convenience we shall 
call them that.” 
A T first, Pa was as flabbergasted as I was, but the more 
he listened to Butch’s Pa and the 
more he thought about it, the more 
he seemed to become convinced 
there might be something to it. 
“There sure-God has been 
something causing all this hard 
luck of ours,” he declared. “A man 
can’t turn his hand to a thing but 
it goes wrong on him. And I must 
admit that it makes a man sore 
to have all these things happen to 
him and then look at Carter and 
see all the good luck he has.” 
“I am profoundly sorry,” said 
Butch’s Pa, “to discover halflings 
exist on this planet. There were 
many on our old home planet and 
on some of the neighboring worlds, 
but I had no idea they had spread 
this far.” 
“What I don’t rightly understand,” said Pa, lighting up his 
pipe and settling down to hash the 
matter over, “is how they can be 
here and a man not see them.” 
“There is a most precise scientific explanation, but I have not 
the language to translate it You 
might say that they are off-phase 
of this existence, but still not quite 
into it The child eye is undulled, 
the mind unclosed, so that they 
can see somewhat, a fraction, just 
a little, beyond reality. And that 
is why they can be seen by children but are invisible to adults. I, 
in my time, when I was a child, 
saw and killed my share of them. 
You understand, sir, that on my 
planet, it is an accepted childish 
chore to be eternally on watch 
for them and vigilantly keep their 
numbers down.” 
Pa asked me: “You didn’t see 
these things?” 
“No, Pa,” I said, “I didn’t.” 
“And you didn’t see them, 
either?” Pa asked Butch’s Pa. 
“I lost my ability to see them 
many years ago,” said Butch’s Pa. 
“So far as your boy is concerned, 
it may be that only the children of 
certain races—” 
“But they must see us,” Pa insisted. “Otherwise, how would they 
be able to bring good luck or 
bad?” 
“They do see us. In that, all are 
agreed. I assure you that the scientists of my planet have devoted 
many long and arduous years to 
the study of these beings.” 
“And another thing. What is 
their purpose in adopting people? 
What do they get out of it? Why 
should they show all this favoritism?” 
“We are not sure,” said Butch’s 
Pa. “There are several theories. 
One is that they have no life of 
their own, but must have a pattern 
in order to live. If they did not 
have a pattern, they would have 
no form nor senses and probably 
no perception. They are, it would 
seem, like parasites in many ways.” 
But Pa interrupted him. Pa was 
all wound up and had a lot of 
thinking that he had to do out 
loud. 
“I don’t suppose,” he said, “that 
they are doing it just for the hell 
of it. There must be a solid reason 
— there is to everything. It seems 
reasonable to me that everything 
is planned, that there’s nothing 
without purpose. There’s nothing, 
when you get right down to it, 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
that basically is bad. Maybe these 
things, with the bad luck that they 
bring, are part of a plan to make 
folks face up to adversity and develop character.” 
T SWEAR it was the first time 
I had ever heard Pa sound 
like a preacher, but he sure did 
then. 
“You may be right,” said 
Butch’s Pa. “There is no agreement entirely on the reason for 
their being.” 
“They might,” suggested Pa, “be 
a sort of gypsy tribe, just wandering around. They might up and 
move away.” 
Butch’s Pa sadly shook his head. 
“It almost never happens, sir, that 
they move away.” 
“When I was a kid, I once went 
to the city with my Ma. I don’t 
remember much about it, but I do 
remember standing in front of a 
great big window that was filled 
with toys and knowing that I 
never could have any one of them, 
and wishing hard that some day 
I might have just one of them. 
Maybe that’s the way it is with 
these folks. Maybe they’re just 
outside the window looking in on 
us.” 
“Your analogy is exceedingly 
picturesque,” said Butch’s Pa with 
forthright admiration. 
“But here I am running on,” 
Pa said, “as if I took for gospel 
every word of it. I don’t wish for 
the world to doubt you or what 
told us . 
“But you do and I cannot find 
it in my breast to blame you. 
Would you, perhaps, believe more 
readily if your son could tell you 
that he saw them?” 
“Why, yes,” Pa said thoughtfully. “I surely would.” 
“Before I came to Earth, I was 
a worker in the field of optics, and 
it may be possible that I can grind 
a set of lenses that would allow 
your son to see halflings. I am not 
sure he could, of course, but it is 
a chance worth taking. He is of 
the age to have still that ability to 
peer beyond reality. It may be 
that all his vision needs is a slight 
correction.” 
“If you could do that, if Steve 
here could really see these things, 
then I would believe you without 
the slightest question.” 
“I’ll get on with it immediately,” said Butch’s Pa. “Later on, we 
can discuss the ethics of the situation.” 
ID A sat watching Butch and his 
Pa going down the road, 
and he sort of shuddered. “Some 
of these aliens sure-God come up 
with queer ideas. A man has got 
to watch himself or he might swallow some of them.” 
“These ones are all right,” I 
told him. 
Pa sat there thinking and I 
could almost see the wheels whir
ring in his brain. “I don’t know too 
much about it, but the more one 
thinks about it, the more sense it 
makes. It seems reasonable to me 
that there might be just so much 
good luck and so much bad luck, 
and ordinarily both the good and 
the bad would be handed out in 
somewhat equal parts. But suppose something came along and 
corralled all the good luck for one 
particular man, then there ain’t 
anything but bad luck left for the 
rest.” 
I wished that I could see it as 
clear as Pa. But the more I 
thought, the more like Greek it 
seemed. 
“Maybe,” said Pa, “when you 
get to the root of it, it’s nothing 
more than simple competition. 
What is good luck for one man is 
bad luck for another. Say there is 
a job that everybody wants. One 
man gets it and that’s good luck 
for him, but bad luck for the 
others. And say that this bear back 
in the woods just had to raid a 
hive. It would be bad luck for the 
man whose hive was raided, but 
good luck — or at least not bad 
luck — for the man whose hive 
the bear passed up. And say again 
that someone’s tractor had to get 
busted ...” 
Pa went on like that for quite a 
while, but I don’t think he even 
fooled himself. Both of us knew, 
I guess, that there would have to 
be more to it than that. 
"C^ ANCY Pants and Nature Boy 
were sore at me for not coming back with the crowbar. They 
said I stood them up and I had 
to explain to them I hadn’t and 
I had to tell them exactly what 
had happened before they would 
believe me. I suppose it might 
have been better if I had kept 
my mouth shut, but in the end I 
don’t believe it made much difference. 
Anyhow, we got to be friends 
again and we all liked Butch, so 
we had good times together. The 
other two kidded Butch a lot 
about the halflings at first, but 
Butch didn’t seem to mind, so they 
gave it up. 
We certainly had a good time 
that summer. There was the lizard 
and a lot of other things as well, 
including the family of skunks that 
fell in love with Nature Boy and 
followed him around. And there 
was the time Fancy Pants hauled 
all of Carter’s machinery out into 
the back forty, with Andy hunting for it like lost cows and madder by the minute. 
At home, and elsewhere in the 
neighborhood, there was still bad 
luck. The day the barn caved in, 
Pa was ready to admit flat out 
that there was something to what 
Butch’s Pa had said. It was all Ma 
could do to keep him from going 
up the road to see Andy Carter 
and talk to him by hand. 
I had another birthday and the 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
folks gave me a live-it set and 
that was something I had not expected. I had wanted one, of 
course, but I knew they cost a 
lot and with all the bad luck they 
had been having, the folks were 
short of money. 
You know what a live-it is, of 
course. It’s something like TV, 
only better. TV you only watch 
and with a live-it set you live it. 
It’s a viewer that you clamp 
onto your head and you look into 
it and you pick your channel and 
turn it on, then settle back and 
live the things you see. 
It doesn’t take any imagination 
to live it, because it all is there 
— the action and the sound and 
smell and even, to some extent, the 
actual feel of it. 
My set was just a kid’s set and 
I could only get the kid channels. 
But that was all right with me. I 
wouldn’t have wanted to live 
through all that mushy stuff. 
All morning I spent with my 
live-it. There was one thing called 
“Survey Incident” and it was all 
about what happened when a human survey team put down on 
an alien planet. Another one was 
about a hunting trip on a jungle 
world and a third was “Robin 
Hood.” I think, of the three of 
them, I liked “Robin Hood” the 
best. 
I was all puffed up with pleasure and pride and I wanted to 
show the kids what the folks had 
given me. So I took the live-it and 
went down to Fancy Pants’ place. 
But I never got a chance to show 
the live-it to him. 
J UST before I got to the gate, 
I saw Fancy Pants floating 
along, silent and sneaky — and 
floating along beside him, not 
more than a yard away, was that 
poor, beat-up, bedraggled cat that 
Fancy Pants was always pestering. He had the cat all wrapped 
up in a tight bundle and it 
couldn’t move a muscle, but I 
could see its eyes were wide with 
fright. If you ask me, that cat 
had a right to be afraid. There 
was scarcely anything in the book 
Fancy Pants hadn’t done to it. 
“Hi, Fancy Pants!” I yelled. 
He put a finger to his lips and 
crooked another finger to let me 
know I could join him in whatever he was doing. So I jumped 
the fence and Fancy Pants 
floated lower until he was about 
my level. 
“What’s going on?” I asked 
him. 
“He went away and forgot to 
close the padlock,” whispered 
Fancy Pants. 
“Who went away?” 
“My Pa. He forgot to lock the 
door to the old machine shed.” 
“But that’s where — ” 
“Sure,” said Fancy Pants. 
“That’s where he’s got the time 
machine.” 
“Fancy Pants, you don’t intend 
to put that cat in there!” 
“Why not? Pa ain’t ever tried 
a living thing in it and I want to 
see what happens.” 
I didn’t like it and yet I wanted 
awful bad to see that time machine. I wondered what one 
looked like. No one had seen the 
time machine except Fancy 
Pants’ Pa. 
“What’s the matter with you?’” 
asked Fancy Pants. “Are you going chicken on me?” 
“But the cat!” 
“For the love of Mike, it’s 
nothing but a cat.” 
And that was right, of course. 
It was nothing but a cat. 
So I went along with him and 
we sneaked into the shed and 
pulled the door behind us. And 
there was the time machine in 
the middle of the floor. 
It didn’t look like much. It was 
a kind of hopper, and a bunch of 
things like coils ran around the 
throat where the hopper narrowed down, and that was all except for a crude control board 
that was nailed onto a post and 
hooked up to the hopper with a 
lot of wires. 
The hopper came up to my 
chest and I put my live-it down 
on the edge of it and craned my 
neck to look into the throat to 
see what I could see. 
At just that moment, Fancy 
Pants threw the switch that 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
turned it on. I jerked away. For 
it was a scary business when you 
turned that hopper on. 
W HEN I sneaked back to 
have another look, it looked 
for all the world as if it were 
a whirlpool of cream, sort of thick 
and rich and shiny — and it was 
alive. You could see the liveness 
in it. And there was a feeling in 
it that maybe you should just 
jump in head first and I had to 
grip the edges of the hopper hard 
not to. 
I might have dived in, if the 
cat at that very moment hadn’t 
somehow wiggled free from Fancy Pants. 
I don’t know how that cat did 
it. Fancy Pants had it all rolled 
into a ball and really buttoned 
up. Maybe Fancy Pants got careless or maybe the cat had finally 
figured out an angle. But, anyhow, Fancy Pants had the cat 
poised above the hopper and was 
about to let it fall. The cat didn’t 
get loose in part — it got loose 
entirely — and there it was, 
yowling and screaming, tail 
fluffed out, clawing at thin air 
to keep from falling down into 
the hopper. It managed to throw 
itself to one side as it fell and 
the claws of one paw hooked 
onto the hopper’s edge while the 
other hooked into my live-it set. 
I let out a yell and made a 
grab to try to save the live-it, 
but I was too late. The cat 
dragged it off balance and it slid 
down into that creamy whirlpool and was gone. 
The cat shinnied up a post and 
up into the rafters and hung 
there, screaming and wailing. 
Just then the door came open 
and there floated Fancy Pants’ 
Pa and we were caught redhanded. 
I figured Fancy Pants’ Pa 
would give me the works right 
then and there. 
But he didn’t do a thing. He 
just floated there for a moment 
looking at the two of us. 
Then he looked at me alone 
and said: “Steve, please leave.” 
I went out that door as fast 
as I could go, with just a fast 
glance back over my shoulder 
at Fancy Pants. He was pale and 
already beginning to appear a little shriveled. He knew what he 
had coming to him, and even 
while I realized that he deserved 
every bit of it, I still felt sorry 
for him. 
But staying wouldn’t help him 
and I was glad enough to get off 
scot-free. 
Except that it wasn’t scot-free. 
I don’t know what was the matter with me — just scared stiff, 
I guess. Anyhow, I went straight 
home and told Pa right out about 
it and he took down the strap 
from behind the door and let me 
have a few. 
But it seemed to me that he 
didn’t have his heart in it. He 
was getting a little uneasy about 
all these alien goings-on. 
For several days, I didn’t go off 
the place. To have gone anywhere, I would have had to walk 
past Fancy Pants’ house and I 
didn’t want to see him — not 
for a while, at least. 
Then one day Butch and his 
Pa showed up and they had the 
glasses. 
“I don’t know if they’ll fit,” 
said Butch’s Pa. “I had to guess 
the fitting.” 
' I y HEY looked just like any other 
glasses except that the lenses 
had funny lines running every 
which way, as if someone had taken 
the glass and twisted it until it was 
all crinkled out of shape. 
I put them on and they were a 
bit loose and things looked different through them, but not a 
great deal different. I was looking at the barnyard when I put 
them on. The barnyard was still 
there, but it appeared strange 
and a little weird, although it was 
hard to put a finger on what was 
wrong with it. It was a bright, 
hot August day and the sun was 
shining hard, but when I put the 
glasses on, it seemed suddenly 
to get cloudy and a little cold. 
And that was some of the difference, but not all of it. 
There was a feeling of strange
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
ness that sent a shiver through 
me, and the light was wrong, and 
worst of all was the sense that I 
didn’t belong. But there was 
nothing you could say flat out 
was absolutely wrong. 
“It is any different, son?” asked 
Pa. 
“Some different,” I answered. 
“Let me see.” 
He took the glasses off me and 
put them on himself. 
“I can’t see a thing,” he said. 
“Just a lot of color.” 
“I told you,” said Butch’s Pa, 
“that only the young can see. 
You and I are too fixed in 
reality.” 
Pa took the glasses off and let 
them dangle in his hand. 
“Did you see any halflings?” he 
asked me. 
I shook my head. 
“There are no halflings here,” 
said Butch. 
“To see the halflings,” Butch’s 
Pa put in, “we must journey to 
the Carter place.” 
“Well, then,” said Pa, “what are 
we waiting for?” 
So the four of us went up the 
road to the Carter place. 
There didn’t seem to be anyone at home and that was rather 
queer, for either Carter himself 
or Mrs. Carter or Ozzie Burns, 
the hired man, always stayed at 
home if the others had to go to 
town or anywhere. 
We stood in the road and 
Butch had himself a good look. 
There weren’t any halflings 
around the buildings and there 
weren’t any in the orchard or in 
any of the fields, so far as Butch 
could see. Pa was getting impatient. I knew what he was thinking — that he had been made a 
fool of by a bunch of aliens. 
Then Butch said excitedly that 
he thought he saw a halfling 
down in one corner of the pasture, just at the edge of the big 
Dark Hollow woods, where Andy 
had a hay barn, but it was so far 
away that he could not be sure. 
“Give your boy the glasses,” 
said Butch’s Pa, “and let him 
have a look.” 
Pa handed me the glasses and 
I put them on. I had a hard time 
getting familiar landmarks sorted 
out, but finally I did, and sure 
enough, down in the corner of the 
pasture, there were things moving around that looked like human beings, but mighty funny 
human beings. They had a sort 
of smoky look about them, as if 
you could blow them away. 
“Well, what do you see?” asked 
Pa. 
T TOLD him what I saw and 
he stood there considering, 
rubbing his hand back and forth 
across his chin, with the whiskers 
grating. 
“There doesn’t seem to be a 
soul around,” he said. “I don’t 
suppose it would hurt if we went 
down there. If the things are 
there, I want Steve to have a 
good, hard look at them.” 
“You think it is all right?” 
asked Butch’s Pa, worried. “It’s 
not unethical?” 
“Well, sure,” said Pa, “I suppose it is. But if we are quick 
about it and get out right away, 
Andy never need know.” 
So we crawled underneath the 
fence and went over the pasture 
and crossed into the woods so 
we could sneak up on the place 
where we had seen the halflings. 
The going was a little rough, 
for in places the brush was rather 
heavy, and there were thick 
blackberry patches with the 
bushes loaded with black and 
shiny fruit. 
But we sneaked along as 
quietly as we could and we finally reached a point opposite the 
place where we had seen the 
halflings. 
Butch nudged me and whispered fiercely: “There they are!” 
I put the glasses on and there 
they were, by golly. 
Up at the edge of the hayfield, 
just beyond the woods, stood 
Andy’s hay barn, really just a 
roof set on poles to cover the hay 
that Andy didn’t have the room 
to get into his regular barn. 
It was a rundown, dilapidated 
thing, and there was Andy standing up there on the roof, and 
some packs of shingles sat on the 
roof beside him, while climbing up 
a ladder with a bunch of shingles 
on his shoulder was Ozzie Burns, 
the hired man. Andy was reaching down to get the shingles that 
Ozzie was carrying up the ladder 
and at the foot of the ladder, 
hanging onto it so it wouldn’t 
tip, was Mrs. Burns. And that was 
the reason none of them had been 
around — they were all down here, 
fixing to patch up the shingles on 
the barn. 
And there were the halflings, a 
good two dozen of them. A bunch 
of them were up on the roof with 
Andy and a couple on the ladder 
with the hired man and a couple 
more of them helping to hold up 
the ladder. They looked busy and 
energetic and efficient, and every 
single one of them was the spitting image of Andy Carter. 
Not that they really resembled 
Andy, for they didn’t. They were 
actually wraithlike things that 
seemed to have but little substance to them. They were little 
more than a smoky outline, but 
those smoky outlines— every single 
one of them — was the squat, bulldog outline of Andy Carter. And 
they walked like him, with a belligerent swagger, and all their motions were like his, and you could 
sense the meanness in them. 
In the time that I was gaping 
at them, Ozzie Burns had handed 
the shingles up to Andy and clam
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
bered up on the roof beside him 
and Mrs. Burns had stepped away 
from the ladder, not needing to 
hold it any longer, since Ozzie was 
safe up on the roof. I saw the ladder was standing on uneven 
ground and that was why she’d 
had to hold it. 
Andy had been crouched down 
to lay the pack of shingles on the 
roof. Now he straightened up and 
looked toward the woods and he 
saw us standing there. 
“What are you doing here?” he 
roared at us, and started down the 
ladder. 
And now comes the funny part 
of it. I’ll have to take it slow and 
try to tell it straight. 
' I ’ O me, it seemed the ladder 
separated and became two ladders. One was standing there 
against the hay barn and the other 
left it, and the top of this second 
ladder began to slide along the 
roof and was about to fall and 
carry Andy with it to the ground, 
just as sure as shooting. 
I was about to shout for Andy 
to look out, although I don’t know 
why I should have. If he fell and 
broke his neck, it’d have been all 
right with me. 
But just as I was about to yell, 
two halflings moved fast and this 
second ladder disappeared. It had 
been sliding along the roof and 
was about to fall, with a second 
Andy clinging to it and beginning 
to look scared — and then suddenly there was just one ladder and 
one Andy instead of two. 
I stood there, shaking, and I 
knew what I had seen, but at that 
moment I wouldn’t admit it, not 
even to myself. 
It was, I told myself, as if I had 
been looking at two separate times 
— at a time when the ladder 
should have fallen and at another 
time when it had not fallen because the halflings hadn’t let it. 
I had seen good luck in actual 
operation. Or the averting of bad 
luck. Whichever it might be, it 
all came out the same. 
And now Andy was almost at 
the ladder’s foot and the halflings 
were coming down from off the 
roof in a helter-skelter fashion — 
some of them jumping off and 
others dropping off, and if they 
had been human instead of what 
they were, there would have been 
a flock of broken legs and necks. 
Pa stepped out of the woods 
into the field and I stepped along 
with him. We knew we were 
walking into trouble, but we 
weren’t ones to run. And trailing 
along behind us were Butch and 
his Pa, but both of them looked 
scared and you could see they had 
no heart for it. 
Then Andy was down off the 
ladder and walking straight toward us and he sure was on the 
warpath. And walking along beside him, in a line on either side of 
him, were all those halflings, and 
they kept in step with him and 
swung their arms like him and 
looked as mean as he did. 
“Now, Andy,” said Pa, trying 
to be conciliatory, “let us be 
reasonable.” But it was quite an 
effort, I can tell you, for Pa to 
speak that way. He hated Andy 
Carter clear up from the ground 
and he sure-God had his reasons. 
Andy had been a rotten neighbor for an awful lot of years. 
“Don’t you tell me to be reasonable!” yelled Andy. “I been hearing all this talk about how you are 
blaming me for what you call hard 
luck. And I tell you to your face 
it ain’t hard luck at all. It’s plain 
downright shiftlessness and bad 
management. And if you think 
you’re going to get anywhere with 
all this talk of yours, you are just 
plain crazy. You been taken in 
by a lot of alien nonsense. If I 
had my way, I’d run all those 
stinking aliens right the hell off 
the planet.” 
O A took a quick step forward 
and I thought he was about to 
clobber Andy. But Butch’s Pa 
jumped forward and grabbed him 
by the arm. 
“No! No!” he shouted. “There’s 
no need to fight him! Let us go 
away!” 
Pa stood there with Butch’s Pa 
hanging to his arm, and I wondered 
for a minute which one he would 
clobber, Butch’s Pa or Andy. 
“I never liked you,” Andy said 
to Pa, “from the first day I saw 
you. I had you figured for a bum 
and that is what you are. And 
this taking up with aliens is the 
lowest thing any human ever did. 
You ain’t no better than they are. 
Now get off this place and don’t 
you ever dare set foot on it again.” 
Pa jerked his arm and sent 
Butch’s Pa staggering to one side. 
Then he brought it up and back. 
I saw Andy’s head start moving to 
one side, dropping over toward 
his shoulder, and for a second it 
looked like he had the beginning 
of two heads. And I knew that I 
was watching another accident beginning to unhappen, although it 
was no accident, for Pa sure meant 
to paste him. 
But they weren’t fast enough to 
get Andy’s head tilted out of danger. They weren’t dealing this time 
with a slowly sliding ladder. 
There was a solid crack like 
someone had hit a tree with an 
axe on a frosty morning, and 
Andy’s head jerked back and his 
feet came off the ground and he 
went tincup over teakettle, flat on 
his back. 
And there were all those silly 
halflings standing in a row, with 
shocked looks upon their faces, 
as if they couldn’t quite believe 
it. You could have bought the lot 
of them for no more than half a 
buck. 
Pa turned around and held out 
his hand to me and said: “Come 
on, Steve. Let’s go.” 
He said it in a quiet voice that 
was clear and level, and there 
was, I thought, a note of pride in 
it. And we turned around, the two 
of us, and we walked away from 
there, not hurrying any and not 
even looking back. 
“I swear to God,” said Pa, “I’ve 
meant to do that ever since I laid 
eyes on him fifteen years ago.” 
I hadn’t noticed what had happened to Butch or to his Pa and 
I wondered where they might have 
gone to, for there wasn’t hide nor 
hair of them. But I didn’t say anything to Pa about it, for I had a 
hunch he might not be harboring 
exactly friendly feelings toward 
Butch’s Pa. 
13 UT I needn’t have worried 
about them, for when we got 
out to the road they were waiting 
for us, breathing kind of hard and 
considerably scratched up. The 
way they’d gone through that 
brush and all those blackberry 
patches must have been a caution. 
“I am glad to see,” said Butch’s 
Pa, “that you got back safely.” 
“Don’t mention it,” Pa told him 
coldly, and went on down the 
road, hanging tight onto my hand 
so that I had to trot along. 
We got back home and went 
into the kitchen to get a drink of 
water. 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
Pa said to me, “Steve, have you 
got those glasses?” 
I dug them out of my pocket 
and handed them to him. He put 
them on the shelf above the washstand. 
“Leave them there,” he said. 
“Don’t touch them again — not 
ever. Do you understand me?” 
“Yes, sir,” I replied. 
To tell the truth, I would have 
liked it better if he’d gone ranting up and down. I was afraid 
that what had happened out there 
in the woods had made him decide to go to one of the Homestead Planets. I told myself he 
maybe already had made up his 
mind and didn’t need to rant. 
But he never said a word about 
the fight with Andy nor about the 
Homestead Planets and he wasn’t 
sore at me. He kept on being quiet 
and I knew that he still was mad 
clean through and I figured that 
he was mostly sore at Butch and 
Butch’s Pa for their having made a 
complete fool of him. 
I did a lot of wondering about 
what I’d seen down there in 
Andy’s hayfield. And the more I 
thought about it, the more I was 
convinced that I had grasped the 
secret of how the halflings operated. 
For I must have been seeing 
in two different times when I’d 
been looking at the ladder. I must 
have looked into the future and 
seen the ladder slip. Except it 
never slipped, for the halflings, seeing that it would slip, had made 
one leg of it settle in the ground. 
And then, with the ladder sitting 
solid, it never slipped, of course. 
The halflings had done no more 
than look ahead a bit and then 
righted something that was about 
to happen before it had a chance 
to happen. 
A ND that, I told myself, was 
the basis of good luck and 
bad. The halflings could spot disaster coming and try to head it off. 
Except they couldn’t always make 
it. They had tried to protect Andy 
when Pa took a lick at him and 
they had failed. So I figured that 
they weren’t infallible and that 
made me feel some better. 
For if they could make good 
luck for Andy, it stood to reason 
they could make bad luck for the 
rest of us. All they had to do, if 
they had a mind to, was to see 
good luck heading for us and 
change it into bad. 
It might even be possible, I 
told myself, that the halflings lived 
ahead of us, by a few seconds or 
so, and that the only thing which 
separated us from them was this 
matter of a different time. 
But there was something else 
that troubled me a lot. Why had 
I been able to see two different 
times? It was clear to me that 
Butch and his people couldn’t, for 
if they could, they’d have more 
answers to the halfling situation. 
They’d been studying it for years, 
and so far as I could figure, they 
didn’t know for certain about this 
two-time business. 
It seemed to me, when I 
thought about it, that Butch’s Pa 
might have ground better than he 
knew when he made my glasses. 
He might have put in something 
or taken out something or done 
something he didn’t know about at 
all. 
Or it might be that the human 
race had a different kind of vision, 
or maybe just a little different, 
and when you added the correction for Butch’s kind of vision to 
our kind of vision, you brought out 
a thing you couldn’t even guess at. 
I tried and tried to get it clear 
within my mind, but I couldn’t 
do it. I just went around in circles. 
I stayed close to home for several days because I had a feeling 
that I should be ignoring Butch 
to uphold the family honor and 
that is how I missed the big hassle 
between Fancy Pants and Nature 
Boy. 
It seems that Nature Boy got 
sick and tired of how Fancy Pants 
was mistreating that poor, bedraggled cat. So he took one member of the skunk family that had 
fallen in love with him and he 
clipped and dyed that skunk to 
look exactly like the cat. And one 
day he sneaked over to Fancy 
Pants’ place and switched the 
skunk for the cat without anyone 
seeing him. 
The skunk didn’t want to be 
Fancy Pants’ skunk; he belonged 
to Nature Boy. So he started beating it back home as fast as he 
could go, which wasn’t very fast. 
Just then Fancy Pants floated 
out of the door and he saw the 
skunk going through the gate. He 
thought the cat was trying to sneak 
away from him, so he reached out 
and grabbed it up and rolled it 
into a ball and tossed it pretty 
high into the air, sort of careless 
like, to teach that cat a lesson. 
It went up in the air and came 
down smack-dab on top of Fancy 
Pants, who was floating out there 
in the yard a few feet off the 
ground. 
The skunk was scared witless. 
As soon as it got its claws fastened 
into Fancy Pants and had some 
leverage, it retaliated with enthusiasm. And for the first time in his 
life, Fancy Pants thumped down 
to the ground and, among other 
things, he got his clothes as dirty 
as any other kid. 
I would give a zillion dollars to 
have seen it. 
OR a while, they figured that 
A they might have to take Fancy 
Pants out somewhere and bury 
him for a week or two to make 
him presentable again. But they 
finally got him to a point where 
one could come near him. 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
Fancy Pants’ Pa went storming 
down to talk with Nature Boy’s Pa 
and the two of them put on a 
ruckus that had the neighborhood 
chuckling for a week. 
And now I was really strapped 
for playmates. I was still coldshouldering Butch and I knew better than to take up again with 
either Nature Boy or Fancy Pants. 
They both were mean cusses when 
they set their mind to it I was 
sure we hadn’t heard the last of 
this feud of theirs and I didn’t 
want to get tangled up in it by 
being friends with either one of 
them. 
It was plenty tough, let me tell 
you. Here I was with vacation almost ended and no one to pal 
around with and my live-it gone. 
I watched the days slip past and 
regretted every minute of it. 
Then one day the sheriff drove 
up to the house. 
Pa and I were out in the barnyard trying to tinker up a corn 
binder that was all tied together 
with haywire and other makeshift 
odds and ends. Pa had been 
threatening to buy one for a long 
time now, but with all the tough 
luck we’d been having, there wasn’t 
any money. 
“Good morning, Henry,” the 
sheriff said to Pa. 
Pa said good morning back. 
“I hear you been having a little 
trouble with your neighbors,” said 
the sheriff. 
“Not what you would call real 
trouble,” Pa told him. “I busted 
one in the snoot the other day is 
all.” 
“Right on his own farm, too.” 
Pa quit working on the binder 
and squatted back on his heels to 
look up at the sheriff. “Andy been 
around complaining?” 
“He was in the other day. Said 
you had swallowed some fool story 
that this new alien family started. 
About some kind of bad-luck critters he’d been harboring on his 
farm.” 
“And you talked him out of it?” 
“Well, now,” said the sheriff, “I 
am a peaceable man and I hate to 
see two neighbors fighting. Andy 
wanted to put you under peace 
bond, but I said I’d come over 
and have a talk with you.” 
“All right,” invited Pa. “Go 
ahead and talk.” 
“Now look here, Henry. You 
know the story about them hardluck critters is so much poppycock. I’m surprised you took any 
stock in it.” 
Pa got up slowly. He had a 
hard look on his face and I thought 
for a minute he was about to bust 
the sheriff. I was scared, I tell 
you, for that is something no one 
should ever do — up and bust a 
sheriff. 
T DON’T know what he might 
done or what he might have 
said, for at that moment Nature 
Boy’s Pa came tearing down the 
road in his old jalopy and pulled 
in behind the sheriff’s car, intending to park there. But he miscalculated some and he smacked into 
the sheriff’s car hard enough to 
skid it ahead six feet or so with 
the brakes all set. 
The sheriff broke into a run. 
“By God!” he said. “It isn’t even 
safe to drive out into this corner 
of the county!” 
The two of us ran along behind him. I was running just because there was some excitement, 
but I figure maybe Pa was running so he could help Nature 
Boy’s Pa if the sheriff should take 
it into his head to get feisty with 
him. 
And the funny thing about it 
was that Nature Boy’s Pa, instead 
of sitting there and waiting for the 
sheriff, had jumped out of his 
car and was running up the slope 
to meet us. 
“They told me I’d find you 
here,” he panted to the sheriff. 
“You found me, all right,” said 
the sheriff, practically breathing 
fire. “Now I’m going to—” 
“My boy is gone!” yelled Nature Boy’s Pa. “He wasn’t home 
last night . .” 
The sheriff grabbed him and 
said to him: “Now let’s take this 
easy. Tell me exactly what happened.” 
“He went off yesterday, early 
in the morning, and he didn’t show 
up for meals, but we didn’t think 
too much of it — he often goes off 
for an entire day. He has a lot 
of friends out there in the woods.” 
“And he didn’t come home last 
night?” 
Nature Boy’s Pa shook his head. 
“Along about dusk, we got worried. I went out and hunted for 
him and I didn’t find him. I 
hunted all night long, but there 
wasn’t any sign of him. I thought 
maybe he’d just holed up for the 
night with one of his friends in 
the woods. I thought maybe he’d 
show up when it got light, but he 
never did.” 
“Well, all right,” said the sheriff, 
“you leave it to me. We’ll rouse 
out all the neighbors and organize 
a hunt. We’ll find him.” He said 
to me: “You know the lad? You 
did some playing with him?” 
“All the time,” I answered. 
“Lead us to all the places where 
you played. We’ll look there first.” 
Pa said: “I’ll start phoning the 
neighbors. I’ll get them here right 
away.” 
He ran up the hill toward the 
house. 
In an hour or less, there were 
a hundred people gathered and the 
sheriff took them all in hand. He 
divided them into posses and appointed captains for each posse 
and told them where to hunt. 
It was the most excitement 
we’ve ever had in the neighborhood. 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
rp HE sheriff took me with the 
posse he headed up and we 
went down Dark Hollow. I took 
them to the place where we were 
digging out the lizard and the 
place where we had started to dig 
ourselves a cave and the hole in 
the creek where Nature Boy had 
made friends with some whopping 
trout, and some other places, too. 
We found some old tracks of Nature Boy’s, but there was no fresh 
sign, although we hunted up and 
down the hollow clear to where 
it flowed into the river, and we 
trailed back come night, and I 
was tuckered out. 
And a little scared as well. 
For an awful suspicion had 
come to me. 
And no matter how hard I 
tried to keep from thinking of it, 
I couldn’t help myself, for all the 
time I was trying to remember if 
the hopper in that time machine 
had been big enough to take a 
kid the size of Nature Boy. 
Ma fed me and sent me up to 
bed and later she came up and 
tucked me in and kissed me. She 
hadn’t done that in years. She 
knew I was too big to be tucked 
in and kissed, but she did it anyhow. 
And then she went downstairs 
and I lay there listening to some 
men who still were out there in 
the yard, talking among themselves. Some of the others still 
were hunting and I knew that I 
should be out there hunting with 
them, but I knew Ma wouldn’t let 
me go and I was glad of it. For I 
was tired all through and the 
woods at night can be a scary 
place. 
I should by rights have gone 
straight to sleep. Any other night 
I would have. But I lay there 
thinking about that hopper in the 
time machine and I wondered 
how long it would take before 
someone told the sheriff about the 
ruckus between Fancy Pants and 
Nature Boy, and I thought perhaps they had already. And if so, 
the sheriff probably was looking 
into it right now, for the sheriff 
was nobody’s fool. 
I wondered if I should tell him 
myself if no one else had. But 
that was one fight I didn’t have 
any hankering to get tangled up in. 
Finally I went to sleep and it 
seemed to me I hadn’t been asleep 
any time at all when something 
woke me up. It still was dark, but 
there was a red glow shining 
through the window. I sat up 
quick, with my hair standing half 
on end. 
I thought at first it might be 
our barn or the machine shed, 
but then I saw it wasn’t that close. 
I skinned out of bed and over to 
the window. That fire was a big 
one and it wasn’t too far up the 
road. 
It looked as if it was on the Carter place, but I knew that must 
be wrong, for if bad luck like that 
struck anyone, it wouldn’t be Andy 
Carter. Unless, of course, he was 
loaded with insurance. 
I went downstairs in my bare 
feet and Ma was standing at the 
door, looking up the road toward 
the blaze. 
“What is it, Ma?” I asked. 
“It’s the barn on the Carter 
place,” she said. “They phoned the 
neighborhood for help, but all the 
men are out hunting Nature Boy.” 
We stood there, Ma and me, 
and watched until the blaze almost 
died out, and then Ma hiked me 
off to bed. 
T CRAWLED underneath the 
-*■ covers, weak with this new 
excitement. I wondered why we 
should tag along for months with 
nothing happening, and then all 
at once have it busting out all 
over. 
I lay there and thought about 
Andy Carter’s barn and there was 
something wrong about it. Andy 
had been the luckiest man in 
seven counties and now, without 
any warning, he was having bad 
luck just like the rest of us. 
I wondered if the halflings 
might have gone off and left him, 
and if that was the case, I wondered why they had. Maybe, I 
told myself, they had gotten plain 
disgusted with Andy’s meanness. 
It was broad daylight when I 
woke again and I jumped straight 
out of bed and climbed into my 
clothes. I rushed downstairs to 
see if there was any word of Nature Boy. 
Ma said there wasn’t, that the 
men were still out hunting. She 
had breakfast ready for me and 
insisted I eat it and warned me 
about wandering off or trying to 
join one of the searching parties. 
She said it wasn’t safe for me to 
be out in the woods with so many 
bears about. And that was funny, 
for she had never worried about 
the bears before. 
But she made me promise I 
wouldn’t. 
As soon as I got out, I zipped 
down the road as fast as I could go. 
I had to see the place where the 
Carter barn had burned down and 
I just had to talk with someone. 
And Butch was the only one left 
that I could talk to. 
There wasn’t much to see at the 
Carter place, just burned and blackened timbers that still were smoking some. I stood out in the road 
a while and then I saw Andy come 
out of the house and he stood there 
for a minute looking straight at me. 
So I got out of there. 
I went past Fancy Pants’ place 
real fast, hoping I wouldn’t see him. 
At the moment, I didn’t want a 
thing to do with Fancy Pants. 
When I got to Butch’s place, his 
Ma told me he was sick in bed. She 
didn’t think it was catching, she 
said, so I went up to see him. 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
Butch sure looked terrible lying 
there — more like a runty hoot owl 
than he ever had before — but he 
was glad to see me. I asked him 
how he was and he said he felt 
better. He made me promise I 
wouldn’t tell his Ma, then told me 
that he’d got sick from eating some 
green apples he’d pinched of? the 
Carter orchard. 
He’d heard about Nature Boy 
and I told him in a whisper the 
suspicions I had. 
He lay there looking at me 
solemnly and finally he said: 
“Steve, I should have told you this 
before. That is no time machine.” 
“No time machine? How do you 
know?” 
“Because I saw the stuff that 
Fancy Pants’ Pa put through it. It 
didn’t go anywhere. It still is lying 
there.” 
“You saw . .” And then I had 
it. “ Y ou mean it went to where the 
halflings are?” 
‘That’s what I mean,” said 
Butch. 
S ITTING there on edge of the 
bed, I tried to think it through, 
but there were so many questions 
bubbling up in me that I couldn’t 
do it. 
“Butch,” I asked, “where is this 
place that the halflings are? 
“I don’t know,” said Butch. “It’s 
close to us, almost in this world, 
but not really.” 
And I remembered something 
Pa had said several weeks before. 
“You mean it’s like a place behind 
a plate-glass window that’s between 
our world and theirs?” 
“Something like that.” 
“And if Nature Boy is there, 
what would happen to him?” 
Butch shuddered. “I don’t know.” 
“Would he be all right? Could 
he breathe in there?” 
“I suppose he could,” said 
Butch. “I think the halflings do.” 
I got up from the bed and started 
for the door. Then I turned back 
again. 
“Butch, what are the halflings 
doing? What are they hanging 
around for?” 
“No one’s sure,” said Butch. 
“There are a lot of ideas about 
what they are after. One is that 
they have to be near something 
that is living before they can live 
themselves. They can’t live a life 
themselves; they’ve got to have a 
life to — well, like imitate, only 
thaf s not the word.” 
“They need a pattern,” I said, 
remembering what Butch’s Pa had 
said that day, before Pa choked him 
off with his own rambling about 
what the halflings might be after. 
“I guess you could call it that,” 
said Butch. 
And I stood there thinking what 
a lousy life the halflings must have 
led, using Andy Carter as their 
pattern. 
But that wasn’t so, for the halfflings, that time I had seen them, 
had sure-God been happy. They’d 
been running around up there on 
the roof and keeping themselves 
busy and enjoying themselves. 
And they had, every one of 
them, looked like Andy Carter. 
And of course they would, with 
Andy as their pattern. 
Thinking about it, I could see 
how someone like Andy, with his 
kind of disposition, might enjoy 
being mean as dirt and ornery 
with his neighbors. He’d have a 
sense of independence and the feel 
of every hand being raised against 
him and him standing there like a 
mighty warrior, defying all of them. 
And from that he’d get a sense of 
strength and domination. All in all, 
I supposed, Andy, for a man like 
him, might be living a pretty 
darned satisfactory life. 
I started for the door, and Butch 
called after me, “Where are you 
going, Steve?” 
“I’m going to find Nature Boy,” 
I said. 
“I’ll go with you.” 
“No, you stay in bed. Your Ma 
will skin both of us if you don’t.” 
I got out of the house and headed 
fast for home, and as I ran, I kept 
on thinking about how the halflings had no life of their own, but 
had to find another life and pattern 
themselves on it. 
Sometimes they’d be mighty 
lucky and fasten onto someone 
who’d give them a good and exciting life, or maybe a good and con
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
tented life, but other times they’d 
get a mighty poor one. But you had 
to say this for them — they gave 
all the help they could to the one 
they’d picked out as a pattern, and 
they kept working at it 
And I wondered how many persons who had been great successes 
might have been watched over by 
the halflings. What an awful letdown it would be if they were to 
learn that they had not become 
great or rich or famous through 
any particular effort or brilliance 
of their own, but by the grace of a 
bunch of things that helped them 
from outside. 
f GOT home and went into the 
kitchen and over to the sink. 
“Is that you, Steve?” Ma called 
from the living room. 
“I’m getting a drink,” I told her. 
“Where you been?” 
“Just around.” 
“Now don’t you go running off,” 
she warned. 
“No, ma’am, I won’t.” 
And all the time I was talking 
to her, I was climbing on a chair so 
I could reach those glasses where 
Pa had put them on the shelf and 
told me not to touch them again — 
not ever. 
Then I had them in my pocket 
and was climbing off the chair. 
I heard Ma heading for the 
kitchen and I hurried out as quietly 
as I could. 
I didn’t put the glasses on until 
I got to where the Carter farm 
cornered on the road. I went along 
the road, watching carefully, and 
finally I found a bunch of halflings 
down in a fence comer just beyond 
the orchard. They were standing 
there and squabbling over something and they didn’t seem to notice me until I got real close. 
Then they all swung around and 
stood facing me. They seemed to 
be talking among themselves and 
pointed at me. 
And there on the head of one of 
them, pushed up on his forehead, 
was the live-it set I had lost down 
the time machine. 
When I saw that, I realized 
Butch actually had seen the stuff 
that Fancy Pants’ Pa had put 
through the time machine. 
At first I don’t think they realized that I could see them, but after 
I stood there for a while, staring 
at them, they began to move up 
closer to me. 
I could feel the hair rearing right 
up on my head. There was nothing 
I wanted to do more than turn 
around and run. But I told myself 
they couldn’t reach me and there 
was nothing to be scared of, so I 
stood on my ground. 
They reminded me of a bunch 
of crows. They must have seen I 
didn’t have a gun, or maybe this 
particular bunch didn’t know about 
the guns Butch’s people had. And 
they crowded up real close to me, 
like a flock of crows is not afraid 
of an empty-handed man, but will 
keep their distance when he has a 
gun. 
I could see their mouths moving 
at me, but naturally I couldn’t hear 
a thing, and they kept pointing at 
the one that had my live-it on his 
head. 
' 1 1 0 tell the honest truth, I didn’t 
pay too close attention to what 
they might have been doing at the 
start of it. I was too busy looking 
at them and trying to figure out 
what might have happened to 
them. There was one thing certain 
— this either was a different bunch 
than I had seen down in Andy Carter’s hay field or they had changed 
a lot. There was still some of Andy 
in them, although not as much of 
him as someone else, as if Andy 
and someone else had gotten sort 
of scrambled together. 
Finally I made out that they 
were pointing at the one with the 
live-it on his head and then tapping their own heads, and I figured 
out that each of them was asking 
for a live-it, too. 
I don’t know what I would have 
said to them or how I would have 
said it, if I had had the chance, 
only I never had the chance. They 
suddenly parted, as if someone 
from behind had pushed them to 
one side, and there was Nature 
Boy, standing face to face with me. 
We stood there and looked at 
one another for a good long time, 
not saying anything, not making 
any motion. Then he stepped forward and I stepped forward until 
we were almost nose to nose. I was 
afraid there, for a moment, we’d 
walk right through each other. 
What would have happened then? 
Probably nothing much. 
“You O.K.?” I asked him, thinking maybe he could read my lips 
even if he couldn’t hear me, but he 
shook his head. So I asked him 
once again, talking slowly and forming my words as distinctly as I 
could. But he shook his head again. 
Then I thought of something 
else. 
I lifted up my hand and stuck 
out my finger and pretended I was 
writing on the imaginary window 
that separated us. 
“YOU O.K.?” I wrote, taking it 
slow, because he’d have to read it 
backwards. 
He didn’t get it right away and I 
did it once again and this time he 
understood. 
“O.K.,” he wrote. And then he 
wrote real slow: “GET ME OUT!” 
I stood there looking at him and 
it was horrible, for there he was 
and here I was, and so far as I 
could see, there was no way to get 
him out. 
He must have sensed what I was 
thinking, because all at once his 
mouth trembled and that was the 
first time I’d even seen Nature Boy 
even close to crying. Not even that 
time when we were digging out the 
lizard and a big rock fell on his toe. 
I thought how bad it must have 
been for him, trapped in that place 
and able to see out, but knowing 
that no one could see in. He might 
even have followed some of the 
searching parties, hoping that someone might accidentally glimpse 
him, but knowing they couldn’t. 
Maybe he had trailed along behind 
his Pa, as close as he could get to 
him, and his Pa not knowing it. 
And maybe he’d gone back home 
and watched his family and been 
all the lonelier for their not knowing he was there. And undoubtedly 
he’d hunted around for Butch, who 
he knew could see him, only Butch 
had been sick in bed. 
And while I was thinking all of 
this, I got a faint idea. I told myself 
that it probably wouldn’t work, but 
the more I thought about it, the 
more it seemed it might. 
So I reached up with my finger 
and I wrote: “MEET ME AT 
FANCY PANTS.” 
I" pocketed my glasses and hurried along home. I circled 
around the house because I didn’t 
want to take the chance of Ma 
seeing me and not letting me go. 
I went into the machine shed and 
found a length of rope and hunted 
up a hacksaw. 
Lugging these, I made my way 
back to Fancy Pants’ place. The 
machine shed was back of the barn, 
so no one from the house could 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
see me, and anyhow no one seemed 
to be around. I knew that Fancy 
Pants’ Pa, and maybe Fancy Pants 
himself, would be out with the 
searchers, floating around over 
places where it would be impossible for the men on foot to go. 
I laid down the rope and hacksaw and put on my glasses and 
Nature Boy was there, right beside 
the machine shed door. He had 
some of the halflings with him, 
including the one who still had the 
live-it perched up on his forehead. 
And scattered all around the place, 
just like Butch had said, were tea 
cups and pie plates and children’s 
blocks and a lot of other junk — 
the stuff that Fancy Pants’ Pa had 
fed into the time machine. 
I looked at the halflings again 
and all at once I knew what was 
different about them. They were 
still some of Andy, but they were 
Nature Boy as well. And then I 
knew why Andy’s barn had burned. 
These halflings of his had been so 
busy tagging around Nature Boy 
that they had not been able to 
give Andy their attention. 
It seemed only natural, of 
course. A halfling would get a lot 
more good out of a real live human 
inside that world of theirs than 
they would someone they could 
only see from behind a plate-glass 
window. 
I took the glasses off and put 
them in my pocket and got to 
work. It was no easy job to saw 
through that padlock. The steel 
was awfully hard and the blade 
was dull and I was afraid it might 
break before I got through the steel. 
I cussed myself for not thinking to 
bring along an extra blade or two. 
The sawing made an awful 
racket because I had forgotten to 
bring along some oil to squirt into 
the cut. But nobody heard the 
sawing. 
Finally I got through. 
I opened the door and stepped 
into the shed and the time machine was there, just the way I 
remembered it. I laid down the 
rope and went over to the control 
board and studied it, but it wasn’t 
very complicated. 
I got it turned on and the creamy 
whirlpool was sliding in the hopper’s throat. 
I picked up the rope and put my 
glasses on and got an awful fright. 
The machine shed was built on a 
gentle slope and the floor I was 
standing on was four or five feet 
above the ground and there I was, 
standing in the air, or so it seemed 
to me. 
I had a sense, not of falling, but 
that by rights I should be falling, 
that any minute now I would begin 
to fall. I knew I wouldn’t, naturally 
— I was standing on a transparent 
but solid floor. But knowing that 
didn’t help much. That horrible, 
dreamlike feeling that I was about 
to tumble to the ground still kept 
hold of me. 
And to make it even worse, there 
was Nature Boy, • standing underneath me, with his head about level 
with my feet, looking up at me. His 
face was hopeful and he was motioning me to get busy with the 
rope. 
1%/T OVING cautiously, even if 
there was no need of caution, 
I took one end of the rope and 
tossed it down the hopper and felt 
the suck and tug of the creamy 
whirlpool pulling down the rope. 
Down underneath the hopper, I 
could see the rope coming out, 
dangling into that place where 
Nature Boy was trapped. He 
moved over quickly and grabbed 
hold of the rope and I could feel 
the weight of the pull he put on it. 
Nature Boy was about my size, 
perhaps a little smaller, and I knew 
I’d have to pull as hard as ever I 
could to get him out of there. I 
even wound a hitch around my 
hand to make sure it wouldn’t slip. 
I pulled with all my might. And 
that rope didn’t budge. It felt as if 
I were pulling against a house. I 
couldn’t gain an inch. 
So I quit pulling and knelt 
down, still hanging to the rope, 
peering at the base of the time 
machine. 
It was a funny thing. The rope 
went to the bottom of the hopper’s 
throat and then it skipped a foot 
or two. There was a foot or so of 
sidewise space where there wasn’t 
any rope, and then the rope took up 
again, dangling down into that 
other place where Nature Boy had 
hold of it. 
It didn’t make sense. That rope 
should have gone into that other 
world in a straight and simple line. 
But the fact was that it didn’t. It 
went off somewhere else before it 
fell into the other world. 
And that, I figured, was the 
reason I couldn’t pull it out. 
You could put a thing through 
the time machine, but you couldn’t 
pull it back. 
I looked down at Nature Boy 
and he looked back at me. I knew 
he’d seen it and knew as well as I 
did exactly what it meant He 
looked pretty pitiful and I don’t 
suppose I looked any better. 
Just then the machine shed door 
screeched open. 
I jumped up, still hanging to the 
rope, and there was Fancy Pants’ 
Pa. 
He was all burned up and I 
couldn’t blame him. Not after seeing how I had sawed the padlock 
to break into the place. 
“Steve,” he said, and you could 
hear him fighting to keep his voice 
level, “I thought I told you to keep 
out of here.” 
“Yes, sir,” I said, “but Nature 
Boy’s in there.” 
“Nature Boy!” he shouted. Then 
his voice dropped. “You don’t 
know what you’re talking about 
How could he get in?” 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
“I don’t know,” I said, though I 
could have told him. 
“Those glasses you are wearing,” 
asked Fancy Pants’ Pa. “Are those 
the ones that were made for you 
by Butch’s father?” 
I nodded. 
“Then you can see?” 
“I can see Nature Boy,” I said. 
“Just as plain as day.” 
1 LET go of the rope to take my 
glasses off and the rope slid 
down that hopper slicker than a 
whistle. 
“It’s all right, I guess,” I said. “I 
couldn’t pull him out.” 
“Steve,” said Fancy Pants’ Pa, 
“I want you to tell me the truth. 
You’re not just thinking up a 
story? You are not pretending?” 
He was awful pale and I saw 
what he was thinking — if Nature 
Boy had gone down that hopper, 
the entire neighborhood would be 
down on him like a ton of bricks. 
I crossed my heart. “And hope 
to die,” I added. 
That seemed good enough for 
him. 
He shut off the time machine, 
then went outdoors. I followed him. 
“Now,” he said, “you stay right 
here. I’ll be back immediately.” 
He floated off in somewhat of a 
hurry, zooming away above the 
pasture woods. He was out of sight 
in no time. 
I sat down with my back against 
the machine shed and I was feeling 
pretty low. I knew I should put on 
my glasses, but I kept them in my 
pocket I couldn’t have stood the 
sight of Nature Boy looking out 
at me. 
It was done and over with, I 
knew. There was no way in the 
world for me or anyone to rescue 
Nature Boy. He was gone for good 
and all. He was worse than gone. 
And sitting there, I thought up 
some pretty dreadful things to do 
to Fancy Pants. For there was no 
doubt in my mind that Fancy Pants 
had got into the shed and had 
grabbed Nature Boy, just like he 
did the cat, and dumped him down 
the hopper. 
He was pretty sore, I knew, 
about the trick that Nature Boy 
had played on him with that skunk 
disguised as a cat. There was nothing he would have stopped at to get 
even. 
I was sitting there and thinking 
when Fancy Pants’ Pa came floating up the road, and panting along 
behind him were Pa and the sheriff and Butch’s Pa and Nature 
Boy’s Pa and some other neighbors. 
The sheriff came straight for me 
and he grabbed me by the shoulders and gave me a good, sharp 
shake. 
“Now,” he bellowed, “what is all 
this foolishness? I warn you, boy, 
it will go hard with you if you’ve 
been pulling our leg.” 
I tried to break away from him, 
but he wouldn’t let me go. Then Pa 
stepped up and flung out his arm 
so that it caught the sheriff straight 
across the chest and sent him staggering back. 
“You keep your hands off him,” 
Pa said to the sheriff. 
“But that story,” blustered the 
sheriff. “You surely don’t believe—” 
“I do,” said Pa. “I believe every 
word of it. My boy doesn’t lie.” 
I’ll say this for Pa: He may 
storm around and yell and he may 
take the strap to you for a lot of 
trifling things, but when it comes 
down to the pinch, he’s standing 
there beside you. 
“I’ll remind you, Henry,” said 
the sheriff, bristling, “that you’re 
not entirely in the clear yourself. 
There’s that business of the breach 
of peace I talked Andy Carter out 
of.” 
“Andy Carter,” said Pa, speaking 
more slowly than one would expect 
him to. “He’s the man who lives 
just down the road, if I recall correctly. Has there been any of you 
who have seen him lately?” 
TTE looked around the crowd and 
it seemed that no one had. 
“Last time I talked to Andy,” 
said Pa, “was when I called him on 
the phone and told him we needed 
help. He said he was too busy to 
go hunting any alien whelp. He 
said it would be good riddance if 
all of them got lost” 
He looked around the crowd and 
no one spoke a word. I don’t sup
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
pose it was quite polite of Pa to say 
what he had, with Nature Boy’s Pa 
and Butch’s Pa and all the rest of 
those alien people standing there 
before us. But it sure-God was the 
truth, and they needed it right then, 
and Pa was the one who was not 
afraid to give it to them right 
between the eyes. 
Then someone spoke up from 
the crowd and there were so many 
of them I couldn’t be sure exactly 
who it was. But whoever it was 
said : “I tell you, folks, it was nothing but plain justice when Andy’s 
barn burned down.” 
The sheriff bristled up. “If I 
thought one of you had a hand in 
that, I would—” 
“You wouldn’t do a thing,” said 
Pa. He turned to me. “All right, 
Steve, tell us what you have to tell. 
I promise you that everyone will 
listen and there won’t be any interruptions.” 
He looked straight at the sheriff 
when he was saying it. 
“Just a second, sir,” said Butch’s 
Pa. “I want to voice one important 
point. I know this boy can see the 
halflings, for I myself am the one 
who made the glasses for him. I 
know it is immodest of me to say a 
thing like this, but if I am nothing 
else, I am one fine optician.” 
“Thank you, sir,” Pa said. “And 
now, Steve, go ahead.” 
But I never got a chance to say 
a single word, for Butch came stumbling around the barn and he had 
the gun with him. Or at least I took 
it for the gun, although it didn’t 
look like one. It was a sticklike 
thing and it glittered in the sunlight 
from all sorts of prisms and mirrors 
set into it at all kinds of crazy 
angles. 
“Pa,” yelled Butch, “I heard 
about it and I brought the gun. I 
hope I’m not too late.” 
He ran up to his Pa and his Pa 
took the gun away from him and 
held it with everyone looking at 
him. 
“Thank you, son,” said Butch’s 
Pa. “It was good of you, but we 
won’t need a gun. We aren’t shooting anything today.” 
Then Butch cried out: “There he 
is, Pa! There’s Nature Boy!” 
I am not too sure that all of them 
believed I had found Nature Boy. 
Some might have had their reservations, and kept quiet about it 
because they didn’t want to tangle 
with my Pa. But Butch was a different matter. He could see these 
things without any silly glasses. 
And he was an alien, and everyone 
expected aliens to do these sort of 
crazy things. 
“All right,” admitted the sheriff, 
"so I guess he must be there. Now 
what do we do?” 
“There doesn’t seem to be much 
to go on,” said Pa, “but we can’t 
leave the boy in there.” He looked 
at Nature Boy’s Pa. “Don’t you 
worry. We’ll figure a way to get 
him out.” 
But he spoke with so much confidence that I knew he was only 
talking so that Nature Boy’s Pa 
would know we weren’t giving up. 
O ERSONALLY, I could see no 
hope. If you couldn’t get him 
out the way he had gotten in, there 
didn’t seem to be any other way. 
There were no doors into that 
other place. 
“Gentlemen,” said Butch’s Pa, 
“I have a small idea.” 
We all turned and waited. 
“This gun,” he said, “is used to 
keep down the number of halflings. 
It ruptures the wall between the 
two worlds sufficiently to let a bullet through. There might be an 
adaptation made of it, and we can 
do that later, or have someone do 
it for us, if that be necessary. But 
it seems possible to me we could 
use the gun itself.” 
“But we don’t want to shoot the 
boy,” the sheriff protested. “What 
we want to do is get him out.” 
“I have no intention, sir, of 
shooting him. There will be no bullet in the gun. All we’ll use is the 
device to rupture the curtain or 
whatever it may be that lies between the worlds. And I can— what 
is the word? — tinker, I believe. I 
can tinker up the gun so that rupture will be greater.” 
He sat down on the ground and 
began working on the gun, shifting 
prisms here and there and adjusting tiny mirrors. 
“There is just one thing,” he said. 
“The rupture will last for but a 
moment. The boy must be immediate to take advantage of it. He 
must leap outward instantly the 
rupture should appear.” 
He turned to me. “Steve, can 
you communicate with him?” 
“Communicate?” 
“Talk to him. With signs, perhaps? Or the reading of the lips? 
Or some other way?” 
“Sure, I can do that.” 
“Please, would you do it then?” 
So I put on my glasses and 
looked around until I found Nature 
Boy. I had quite a time making 
him understand what we planned 
to do. It wasn’t any easier to talk 
with him with all those crazy halflings standing all around him and 
making motions at me and pointing 
at the live-it, then tapping their 
own heads. 
I was sweating plenty, for I was 
afraid that I had not got it all 
across to him, but I knew that any 
more of it would do no more than 
confuse him. 
So I told Butch’s Pa that we 
were all set, and Butch’s Pa handed 
Butch the gun, and the rest stepped 
back a ways, and there was Butch 
with the gun and me standing right 
behind him. And there was Nature 
Boy standing in that other place, 
and a bunch of those silly halflings 
clustered all about him, and they 
sure didn’t know about the alien 
gun or they’d not have been stand
ing there. And Nature Boy looked 
like someone who’d been stood 
against a wall and was being executed without even any blindfold. 
Out of the tail of my eye, I saw 
Fancy Pants floating off to one side 
of us, and he was the saddest-looking sack you ever saw. 
Suddenly there was a strange 
white flash of brilliance as all the 
prisms and the mirrors moved on 
the gun that Butch was holding. 
He had pulled a trigger, or whatever it was. 
OR a second, straight in front 
of us, a funny sort of hole 
seemed to open up in the place 
that should not have been there 
at all — a jagged, ragged hole that 
appeared in nothingness. And I 
caught sight of Nature Boy jumping through the hole the second it 
stayed open. 
And there he was, staggering a 
bit from the jump that he had 
made — only he was not alone. He 
had one of the halflings with him! 
He had him by the wrist in a 
good tight grip and it was plain to 
see that he had jerked him through 
with him, for the halfling did not 
seem at all happy about what had 
happened to him. I saw at once that 
it was the halfling who had the 
live-it on his head. 
Butch pushed the halfling 
toward me and he said: “Here, 
Steve. It was the only way I could 
get your live-it back.” 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
I saw that Butch was letting go 
of the halfling and I grabbed quick 
by the other wrist and was somewhat surprised to find that he was 
solid. I would not have been astonished if my hand had gone right 
through him, for he still had that 
swirly-smoky look about him, although it seemed to me he might 
be hardening up a bit and becoming more substantial. 
Pa moved over close beside me, 
saying, “You be careful, Steve!” 
“Aw, he’s all right,” I said. “He’s 
not even trying to get away from 
me. 
Someone raised a shout and I 
whirled around and stared. 
A half-dozen of the halflings had 
grabbed hold of the edges of that 
door into the other world, and they 
were tugging for dear life so it 
would stay open, and pouring out 
of it was that entire herd of halflings! They were shoving and pushing and scrambling to get through, 
and there were a lot more of them, 
it seemed to me, than I had thought 
there were. 
We just stood there and watched 
them until they all were through. 
We didn’t do a thing because there 
was not a thing we could do. And 
they stood there in a bunch, packed 
tight together, staring back at us. 
The sheriff came alongside Pa. 
He pushed back his hat until it 
roosted on his neck. You could see 
that the sheriff was flabbergasted 
and I enjoyed it, for it had been 
apparent from the very first that 
the sheriff hadn’t believed a word 
he’d heard about the halflings. 
I don’t know, maybe he still was 
thinking that it might be nothing 
but some sort of alien joke. You 
could see, without half trying, that 
the sheriff didn’t cotton to any 
aliens. 
“How come,” he asked suspiciously, “that this one here has 
got a live-it on?” 
So I told him and he blinked at 
me, dazed and dumfounded, but 
he said nothing back. I sure had 
shut him up. 
Fancy Pants’ Pa had floated up 
while I was telling it and he said 
I told the truth, for he’d been there 
and seen it. 
Everyone began to talk at once, 
but Fancy Pants’ Pa floated up a 
little higher and held up his hand 
to command attention. 
“Just a moment, if you please,” 
he said. “Before we get down to 
more serious business, I have something you must hear. As you may 
suspect, knowing the episode of 
the skunk, my family undoubtedly 
has a great deal to answer for in 
this incident” 
A HUMAN saying things like 
that would sound silly and 
pompous, but Fancy Pants’ Pa 
could get away with it. 
“So,” said Farley Pants’ Pa, “I 
now announce to you that my 
malefactor son, for the forthcoming 
thirty days, must walk upon his 
feet. He must not float an inch. If 
the punishment does not seem sufficient—” 
“It’s enough,” Pa cut in. “The 
boy has to learn his lesson, but 
there is no use being harsh with 
him.” 
“Now, sir,” said Nature Boy’s Pa, 
being very formal, “it is not necessary—” 
“I insist,” Fancy Pants’ Pa said. 
“I really must insist. It can be no 
other way.” 
“Say,” bawled the sheriff, “will 
someone explain to me what this 
is all about?” 
“Sheriff,” Pa said to him, “your 
understanding of this matter is of 
no great importance and it would 
take too long to explain. We have 
more important business we should 
be attending to.” He turned around 
a bit so he faced the crowd. “Well, 
gentlemen, what do we do next? It 
appears to me that we have some 
guests. And remembering that 
these critters are bearers of good 
luck, it would seem to me we 
should treat them as kindly as we 
can.” 
“Pa,” I said, tugging at his coat 
sleeve, “I know how we can get 
them over on our side. Every one 
of them wants a live-it set.” 
“That’s right,” spoke up Nature 
Boy. “All the time I was in there, 
they pestered me and pestered me 
about how to get the sets. All the 
time they squabbled over who 
NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN 
would get to use Steve’s set next.” 
“You mean,” the sheriff asked, in 
a weak voice, “that these things 
can talk?” 
“Why, sure they can,” said Nature Boy. “They learn a lot more 
back in that world of theirs than 
you could ever guess.” 
“Well, now,” Pa said with a lot 
of satisfaction, “if that is all they 
want, it’s not too great a price for 
us to pay to get us some good luck. 
We’ll just buy a lot of live-it sets. 
We can probably get them wholesale—” 
“But if we get the live-its,” objected Butch’s Pa, “they’ll just lie 
around and use them and be of no 
help to us at all. They won’t need 
us any more. They’ll have all these 
patterns they need from the live-it 
sets.” 
“Well, anyhow,” said Pa, “even if 
that should be true, we’ll get them 
off our necks. They won’t pester 
us with this bad luck they commit.” 
“It won’t do us any good however you look at it,” declared 
Butch’s Pa, who had a mighty low 
opinion of the halflings. “They all 
live together. That’s the way it’s 
always been. They never helped an 
entire neighborhood, but just one 
man or family in the neighborhood. 
A whole tribe of them comes in and 
they give one family all the benefit 
You couldn’t get them to split up 
and work for all of us.” 
“If you jerks would listen,” said 
the halfling with the live-it on his 
head, “I can get you straightened 
out.” 
It was a shock, I tell you, to hear 
him speak at all. He was the kind 
of thing you’d figure shouldn’t 
speak at all — just a sort of dummy. 
And the way he spoke and the tone 
he used made it even worse. It was 
the way Andy Carter always talked 
— either wild and blustering, or out 
of the corner of his mouth, sarcastic. After listening to Andy all 
these years, that poor halfling 
didn’t know any different. 
VERYONE just stood there, 
staring at the halfling who had 
spoken, while all the other halflings 
were nodding their heads in such 
mad agreement with him that I 
thought they’d snap their necks. 
Pa was the first one to get his 
feet back under him. 
“Go ahead,” he said to the halfling. “We all are listening.” 
“We’ll make a deal with you,” 
said the halfling, using ornery 
words but speaking most respectful, “but you’ll have to level with 
us, see? We’ll work hard for you 
and guard against mishap, but we 
got to have the live-its and no mistake about it. One for each of us— 
and if I was you, mister, I wouldn’t 
try to chisel.” 
“Well, now,” said Pa, “that 
sounds fair enough. But you mean 
all of us?” 
“All of you,” the live-it halfling 
said. 
“You mean you will split up?” 
asked Pa. “Each of us will have at 
least one of you? You won’t all 
live together any more?” 
“I think, sir,” said Fancy Pants’ 
Pa, “that we can depend on that. 
I believe I understand what this 
gentleman is thinking. It is something that happened with the human race on Earth.” 
“What happened here on Earth?” 
asked Pa, sort of flabbergasted. 
“Why,” said Fancy Pants’ Pa, 
“the elimination of the need for 
social clustering. There was a time 
when the human race found it 
necessary to congregate in families 
and tribes for companionship and 
entertainment. Then the race got 
the record player and the radio 
and TV and there was less need 
for get-togethers. A man had entertainment of his own in his home. 
He need not move beyond his living room to be entertained. So the 
spectator and group sports simply 
petered out.” 
“And you think,” asked Pa, “that 
the same thing will happen with 
the halflings if we gave them liveits?” 
“Certainly,” said Fancy Pants’ 
Pa. “We supply them, as it were, 
entertainment for the home, personal entertainment. There will be 
no further need for tribal living.” 
“You said it, pal!” the halfling 
said enthusiastically. 
All the rest of them were nodding in agreement. 
U-DUT it’s still no good,” yelped 
Butch’s Pa, getting real 
riled up. “They’re in this world now, 
and how do you get them back? 
And while they’re here, can they 
do anything for us?” 
“You can stop shooting off your 
mouth right now,” the halfling 
said to Butch’s Pa with utmost respect. “We can’t do anything here 
for you, that’s sure. In this world 
of yours, we can’t see ahead. And 
to do you any good, we have to see 
ahead.” 
“You mean that if we give you 
live-its, you’ll go back home 
again?” asked Pa. 
“Sure,” said the halfling. “Back 
there is our home. Just try to keep 
us from it.” 
“We won’t even try,” Pa said. 
“We might even push you back. 
We’ll give you the live-its and you 
get back there and start to work 
for us.” 
“We’ll work for you hard,” said 
the halfling, “but not all the time. 
We take out some time for looking 
at the live-it. That all right with 
you?” 
“Sure,” Pa agreed. “Sure, that’s 
O.K. with us.” 
“All right,” said the halfling, “get 
us back where we belong.” 
I turned around and walked out 
of the crowd, out to the edge of it. 
For it was all settled now and I had 
a belly full of it. It would be all 
right with me if we never had any 
more excitement in the neighborhood. 
Up by the barn, I saw Fancy 
Pants limping along on the ground. 
He was having a tough time walking. But I didn’t feel the least bit 
sorry for him. He had it coming. 
I figured in just a little while I’d 
go up around the barn and clobber 
him for that time he mopped up 
the road with me. 
It should be an easy job, I told 
myself, with him grounded by his 
Pa for thirty days.

Len Mattern finds his goal! 
Citizen Jell 
By MICHAEL SHAARA 
The problem with working wonders 
is they must be worked — even when 
they're against all common sense I 
Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 
N ONE of his neighbors 
knew Mr. Jell’s great 
problem. None of his 
neighbors, in truth, knew Mr. Jell 
at all. He was only an odd old 
man who lived alone in a little 
house on the riverbank. He had 
the usual little mail box, marked 
“E. Jell,” set on a post in front of 
his house, but he never got any 
mail, and it was not long before 
people began wondering where he 
got the money he lived on. 
Not that he lived well, certainly; all he ever seemed to do was 
just fish, or just sit on the riverbank watching the sky, telling tall 
stories to small children. And none 
of that took any money to do. 
But still, he was a little odd; 
people sensed that. The stories he 
told all his young friends, for in
stance — wild, weird tales about 
spacemen and other planets— people hardly expected tales like that 
from such an old man. Tales about 
cowboys and Indians they might 
have understood, but spaceships? 
So he was definitely an odd old 
man, but just how odd, of course, 
no one ever really knew. The 
stories he told the children, stories 
about space travel, about weird 
creatures far off in the Galaxy— 
those stories were all true. 
Mr. Jell was, in fact, a retired 
spaceman. 
Now that was part of Mr. Jell’s 
problem, but it was not all of it. 
He had very good reasons for not 
telling anybody the truth about 
himself — no one except the children — and he had even more excellent reasons for not letting his 
own people know where he was. 
The race from which Mr. Jell 
had sprung did not allow this sort 
of thing — retirement to Earth. 
They were a fine, tolerant, extremely advanced people, and they 
had learned long ago to leave undeveloped races, like the one on 
Earth, alone. Bitter experience had 
taught them that more harm than 
good came out of giving scientific 
advances to backward races, and 
often just the knowledge of their 
existence caused trouble among 
primitive peoples. 
No, Mr. Jell’s race had for a 
long while quietly avoided contact with planets like Earth, and 
if they had known Mr. Jell had 
violated the law, they would have 
come swiftly and taken him away 
—a thing Mr. Jell would have died 
rather than let happen. 
R. Jell was unhuman, yes, 
but other than that he was 
a very gentle, usual old man. He 
had been born and raised on a 
planet so overpopulated that it 
was one vast city from pole to 
pole. It was the kind of place 
where a man could walk under the 
open sky only on rooftops, where 
vacant lots were a mark of incredible wealth. Mr. Jell had passed 
most of his long life under unbelievably cramped and crowded conditions— either in small spaceships 
or in the tiny rooms of unending 
apartment buildings. 
When Mr. Jell had happened 
across Earth on a long voyage 
some years ago, he had recognized 
it instantly as the place of his 
dreams. He had had to plan very 
carefully, but when the time came 
for his retirement, he was able to 
slip away. The language of Earth 
was already on record; he had no 
trouble learning it, no trouble buying a small cottage on the river in 
a lovely warm place called Florida. 
He settled down quietly, a retired 
old man of one hundred and 
eighty-five, looking forward to the 
best days of his life. 
And Earth turned out to be 
more wonderful than his dreams. 
CITIZEN JELL 
He discovered almost immediately 
that he had a great natural aptitude for fishing, and though the 
hunting instinct had been nearly 
bred out of him and he could no 
longer summon up the will to kill, 
still he could walk in the open 
woods and marvel at the room, the 
incredible open, wide, and unoccupied room, live animals in a real 
forest, and the sky above, clouds 
seen through the trees — real trees, 
which Mr. Jell had seldom seen 
before. And, for a long while, Mr. 
Jell was certainly the happiest man 
on Earth. 
He would arise, very early, to 
watch the sun rise. After that, he 
might fish, depending on the 
weather, or sit home just listening 
to the lovely rain on the roof, 
watching the mighty clouds, the 
lightning. Later in the afternoon, 
he might go for a walk along the 
riverbank, waiting for school to be 
out so he could pass some time 
with the children. 
Whatever else he did, he would 
certainly go looking for the children. 
A lifetime of too much company 
had pushed the need for companionship pretty well out of him, but 
then he had always loved children, 
and they made his life on the river 
complete. They believed him; he 
could tell them his memories in 
safety, and there was something 
very special in that, to have secrets 
with friends. One or two of them, 
the most trustworthy, he even allowed to see the Box. 
Now the Box was something extraordinary, even to so advanced 
a man as Mr. Jell. It was a device 
which analyzed matter, made a 
record of it, and then duplicated it. 
The Box could duplicate anything. 
What Mr. Jell would do, for 
example, would be to put a loaf of 
bread into the Box, and press a 
button, and presto, there would be 
two loaves of bread, each perfectly 
alike, atom for atom. It would be 
absolutely impossible for anyone 
to tell them apart. This was the 
way Mr. Jell made most of his 
food, and all of his money. Once 
he had gotten one original dollar 
bill, the Box went on duplicating 
it — and bread, meat, potatoes, 
anything else Mr. Jell desired was 
instantly available at the touch of 
a button. 
O NCE the Box duplicated a 
thing, anything, it was no 
longer necessary to have the original. The Box filed a record in its 
electronic memory, describing, say, 
bread, and Mr. Jell had only to 
dial a number any time he wanted 
bread. And the Box needed no 
fuel except dirt, leaves, old pieces 
of wood, just anything made out 
of atoms — most of which it would 
arrange into bread or meat or whatever Mr. Jell wanted, and the rest 
of which it would use as a source 
of power. 
So the Box made Mr. Jell entirely independent, but it did even 
more than that; it had one other 
remarkable feature. It could be 
used also as a transmitter and receiver. Of matter. It was, in effect, 
the Sears Roebuck catalogue of 
Mr. Jell’s people, with its own 
built-in delivery service. 
If there was an item Mr. Jell 
needed, any item at all, and that 
item was available on any of the 
planets ruled by Mr. Jell’s people, 
Mr. Jell could dial for it, and it 
would appear in the Box in a matter of seconds. 
The makers of the Box prided 
themselves on the speed of their 
delivery, the ease with which they 
could transmit matter instantaneously across light-years of space. 
Mr. Jell admired this property, too, 
but he could make no use of it. 
For once he had dialed, he would 
also be billed. And of course his 
Box would be traced to Earth. 
That Mr. Jell could not allow. 
No, he would make do with 
whatever was available on Earth. 
He had to get along without the 
catalogue. 
And he really never needed the 
catalogue, not at least for the first 
year, which was perhaps the finest 
year of his life. He lived in perfect freedom, ever-continuing joy, 
on the riverbank, and made some 
special friends: one Charlie, aged 
five, one Linda, aged four, one 
Sam, aged six. He spent a great 
deal of his time with these friends, 
and their parents approved of him 
happily as a free baby-sitter, and 
he was well into his second year 
on Earth when the first temptation arose. 
Bugs. 
Try as he might, Mr. Jell could 
not learn to get along with bugs. 
His air-conditioned, antiseptic, neat 
and odorless existence back home 
had been an irritation, yes, but he 
had never in his life learned to 
live with bugs of any kind, and he 
was too old to start now. But he 
had picked an unfortunate spot. 
The state of Florida was a heaven 
for Mr. Jell, but it was also a 
heaven for bugs. 
There is probably nowhere on 
Earth with a greater variety of insects, large and small, winged and 
stinging, than Florida, and the natural portion of all kinds found 
their ways into Mr. Jell’s peaceful 
existence. He was unable even to 
clear out his own house — never 
mind the endless swarms of mosquitoes that haunted the riverbank 
— and the bugs gave him some 
very nasty moments. And the 
temptation was that he alone, of all 
people on Earth, could have exterminated the bugs at will. 
One of the best-selling export 
gadgets on Mr. Jell’s home world 
was a small, flying, burrowing, 
electronic device which had been 
built specifically to destroy bugs 
on planets they traded with. Mr. 
CITIZEN JELL 
Jell was something of a technician, 
and he might not even have had to 
order a Destroyer through the 
catalogue, but there were other 
problems. 
1M|" R. Jell’s people had not been 
-L” merely capricious when they 
formed their policy of non-intervention. Mr. Jell’s bug-destroyer 
would kill all the bugs, but it would 
undoubtedly ruin the biological balance upon which the country’s animal life rested. The birds which 
fed on the bugs would die, and the 
animals which fed on the birds, 
and so on, down a course which 
could only be disastrous. And even 
one of the little Destroyers would 
put an extraordinary dent in the 
bug population of the area; once 
sent out into the woods, it could 
not be recalled or turned off, and 
it would run for years. 
No, Mr. Jell made the valiant 
decision to endure little itchy 
bumps on his arms for the rest of 
his days. 
Yet that was only the first temptation. Soon there were others, 
much bigger and more serious. Mr. 
Jell had never considered this 
problem at all, but he began to 
realize at last that his people had 
been more right than he knew. 
He was in the uncomfortable position of a man who can do almost 
anything, and does not dare do 
it. A miracle man who must hide 
his miracles. 
The second temptation was 
rain. In the middle of Mr. Jell’s 
second year, a drought began, a 
drought which covered all of 
Florida. He sat by helplessly, day 
after day, while the water level fell 
in his own beloved river, and fish 
died gasping breaths, trapped in 
little pockets upstream. Several 
months of that produced Mr. Jell’s 
second great temptation. Lakes and 
wells were dry all over the country, farms and orange groves were 
dry, there were great fires in the 
woods, birds and animals died by 
the thousands. 
All that while, of course, Mr. 
Jell could easily have made it 
rain. Another simple matter, although this time he would have 
had to send away for the materials, 
through the Box. But he couldn’t 
do that If he did, they would come 
for him, and he consoled himself 
by arguing that he had no right 
to make it rain. That was not 
strictly controllable, either. It 
might rain and rain for several 
days, once started, filling up the 
lakes, yes, and robbing water from 
somewhere else, and then what 
would happen when the normal 
rainy season came? 
Mr. Jell shuddered to think that 
he might be the cause, for all his 
good intentions, of vast floods, and 
he resisted the second temptation. 
But that was relatively easy. The 
third temptation turned out to be 
infinitely harder. 
CITIZEN JELL 
Little Charlie, aged five, owned 
a dog, a grave, sober, studious dog 
named Oscar. On a morning near 
the end of Mr. Jell’s second year, 
Oscar was run over by a truck. 
And Charlie gathered the dog up, 
all crumpled and bleeding and already dead, and carried him tearfully but faithfully off to Mr. Jell, 
who could fix anything. 
And Mr. Jell could certainly 
have fixed Oscar. Hoping to guard 
against just such an accident, he 
had already made a “recording” of 
Oscar several months before. The 
Box had scanned Oscar and discovered exactly how he was made 
— for the Box, as has been said, 
could duplicate anything— and Mr. 
Jell had only to dial Oscar number 
to produce a new Oscar. A live 
Oscar, grave and sober, atom for 
atom identical with the Oscar that 
was dead. 
DUT young Charlie’s parents, 
who had been unable to comfort the boy, came to Mr. Jell’s 
house with him. And Mr. Jell had 
to stand there, red-faced and very 
sad, and deny to Charlie that there 
was anything he could do, and 
watch the look in Charlie’s eyes 
turn into black betrayal. And when 
the boy ran off crying, Mr. Jell 
had the worst temptation of all. 
He thought so at the time, but 
he could not know that the dog 
had not been the worst. The worst 
was yet to come. 
He resisted a great many temptations after that, but now for the 
first time doubt had begun to seep 
in to his otherwise magnificent 
existence. He swore to himself that 
he could never give this life up. 
Here on the riverbank, dry and 
buggy as it well was, was still the 
most wonderful life he had ever 
known, infinitely preferable to the 
drab crowds he would face at 
home. He was an old man, grimly 
aware of the passage of time. He 
would consider himself the luckiest 
of men to be allowed to die and 
be buried here. 
But the temptations went on. 
First there was the Red Tide, 
a fish-killing disease which often 
sweeps Florida’s coast, murdering 
fish by the hundreds of millions. 
He could have cured that, but he 
would have had to send off for the 
chemicals. 
Next there was an infestation of 
the Mediterranean fruit fly, a bug 
which threatened most of Florida’s 
citrus crop and very nearly ruined 
little Linda’s father, a farmer. 
There was a Destroyer available 
which could be set to kill just one 
type of bug, Mr. Jell knew, but 
he would have had to order it, 
again, from the catalogue. So he 
had to let Linda’s father lose most 
of his life’s savings. 
Shortly after that, he found himself tempted by a young, gloomy 
couple, a Mr. and Mrs. Ridge, 
whom he visited one day looking 
for their young son, and found 
himself in the midst of a morbid 
quarrel. Mr. Ridge’s incredible 
point of view was that this was too 
terrible a world to bring children 
into. Mr. Jell found himself on the 
verge of saying that he himself had 
personally visited forty-seven other 
worlds, and not one could hold a 
candle to this one. 
He resisted that, at last, but it 
was surprising how close he had 
come to talking, even over such a 
relatively small thing as that, and 
he had concluded that he was beginning to wear under the strain, 
when there came the day of the 
last temptation. 
Linda, the four-year-old, came 
down with a sickness. Mr. Jell 
learned with a shock that everyone 
on Earth believed her incurable. 
TIE had no choice then. He 
knew that from the moment 
he heard of the illness, and he wondered why he had never until that 
moment anticipated this. There 
was, of course, nothing else he 
could do, much as he loved this 
Earth, and much as he knew little 
Linda would certainly have died 
in the natural order of things. All 
of that made no difference; it had 
finally come home to him that if a 
man is able to help his neighbors 
and does not, then he ends up 
something less than a man. 
He went out on the riverbank 
and thought about it all that after
noon, but he was only delaying the 
decision. He knew he could not go 
on living here or anywhere with 
the knowledge of the one small 
grave for which he would be forever responsible. He knew Linda 
would not begrudge him those few 
moments, that one afternoon more. 
He waited, watching the sun go 
down, and then he went back into 
the house and looked through the 
catalogue. He found the number 
of the serum and dialed for it. 
The serum appeared within less 
than a minute. He took it out of 
the Box and stared at it, the 
thought of the life it would bring 
to Linda driving all despair out 
of his mind. It was a universal 
serum; it would protect her from 
all disease for the rest of her life. 
They would be coming for him 
soon, but he knew it would take 
them a while to get here, perhaps 
even a full day. He did not bother 
to run. He was much to old to run 
and hide. 
He sat for a while thinking of 
how to get the serum to her, but 
that was no problem. Her parents 
would give her anything she asked 
now, and he made up some candy, 
injecting the serum microscopically into the chunks of chocolate, 
and then suddenly had a wondrous 
idea. He put the chunks into the 
Box and went on duplicating candy 
until he had several boxes. 
When he was finished with that, 
he went visiting all the houses of 
CITIZEN JELL 
all the good people he knew, leaving candy for them and their children. He knew he should not do 
that, but, he thought, it couldn’t 
really do much harm, could it? 
Just those few lives altered, out of 
an entire world? 
But the idea had started wheels 
turning in his mind, and toward 
the end of that night, he began to 
chuckle with delight. Might as well 
be flashed for a rogg as a zilb. 
He ordered out one special little 
bug Destroyer, from the Box, set 
to kill just one bug, the medfly, 
and sent it happily down the road 
toward Linda’s farm. After that, he 
duplicated Oscar and sent the dog 
yelping homeward with a note on 
his collar. When he was done with 
that, he ordered a batch of chemicals, several tons of it, and ordered 
a conveyer to carry it down and 
dump it into the river, where it 
would be washed out to sea and 
so end the Red Tide. 
By the time that was over, he 
was very tired; he had been up 
the whole night. He did not know 
what to do about young Mr. Ridge, 
the one who did not want children. 
He decided that if the man was 
that foolish, nothing could help 
him. But there was one other thing 
he could do. Praying silently that 
once he started this thing, it would 
not get out of hand, he made it 
rain. 
In this way, he deprived himself 
of the last sunrise. There was 
nothing but gray sky, misty, blowing, when he went out onto the 
riverbank that morning. But he did 
not really mind. The fresh air and 
the rain on his face were all the 
good-by he could have asked for. 
He was sitting on wet grass wondering the last thought — why in 
God’s name don’t more people 
here realize what a beautiful world 
this is?— when he heard a voice behind him. 
The voice was deep and very 
firm. 
“Citizen Jell,” it said. 
The old man sighed. 
“Coming,” he said, “coming.”

ORBIT AROUND THE SUN 
T HE question that came 
most frequently to me during January and the early 
part of February, by mail, by 
phone and in person after lectures, was one that surprised me 
very much. It was usually phrased 
as follows: “How do we know that 
the Russian rocket which missed 
the Moon is really in orbit around 
the Sun?” The answer I gave was 
more or less that the Russian rocket 
had to be in orbit around the Sun 
because it had no choice.

Orbits of Earth (inner solid circle) and of Mars (outer solid circle) as well as those of minor 
planet 433-Eros (dot-dash line) and rocket Metchta (broken line). Dotted lines with names of 
months on them indicate position of Earth on first day of every month. 
Most of the time, a blank stare 
was all I got for this answer, but 
occasionally somebody wanted to 
know why the rocket did not melt 
from the heat if it was in orbit 
around the Sun. 
Careful cross-questioning made 
it clear to me that the people who 
wondered what would happen to 
the rocket in orbit around the Sim 
had something like a tight orbit in 
mind. Also, some seem to have 
been honestly convinced, incredible 
as it may sound, that the Moon and 
the Sun are both far from the 
Earth in space, but that they are 
pretty close to each other. 
The whole story obviously needs 
some explanation and clarification. 
Probably all readers of Galaxy do 
not need the explanation itself, but 
they can use this column as ammunition if they have to explain the 
whole thing to others. 
The explanation has to begin 
with a few simple figures about the 
orbit of the Earth. Most books state 
that the mean distance of the Earth 
from the Sun is 93 million miles, 
which is correct, provided the little 
word “mean” is not overlooked. In 
reality, the distance varies from 
91.5 million miles at perihelion to 
94.5 million miles at aphelion. Our 
Earth goes through perihelion (the 
point of its orbit closest to the 
Sun) very early in January, while 
the aphelion (the point farthest 
from the Sun) is passed very early 
in July of each year. The mean orbital velocity of the Earth is 18.5 
miles per second. 
4~kNE rather important point 
which is not mentioned at all 
as a rule is that the “dawn side” of 
the Earth leads as the Earth goes 
around the Sun. The point which 
happens to have dawn at the moment is “in front” while the antipodal point is trailing. This is of 
major importance when it comes 
to the movements of things fired 
from Earth. A rocket taking off 
vertically at dawn will add its own 
velocity to the orbital velocity of 
the Earth. A rocket taking off vertically at dusk will subtract its own 
velocity from the orbital velocity 
of the Earth. 
Now remember that every planet 
has just the necessary orbital velocity to keep it in its own orbit. If a 
rocket is fired “ahead” of the planet, 
it is “too fast” for the planet’s orbit 
around the Sun. Consequently it 
will start drifting away from the 
Sun — in other words, it takes on 
an orbit which is larger than the 
orbit of the planet from which it 
was fired. As the rocket drifts away 
from the Sun, its velocity diminishes, and after some time the Sun’s 
gravitational field wins out and the 
rocket will approach the Sun again. 
During this approach, its velocity 
increases so that, when it gets back 
to the orbit of the planet from 
which it was fired, it is again “too 
fast” for that particular orbit and 
it swings outward, away from the 
Sun, again. 
If the rocket were fired at dusk, 
against the orbital movement of 
its home planet, it would be “too 
slow” for the planetary orbit. Logically, then, it would drift inward 
in the Solar System — it would 
come closer to the Sun. But while 
doing so, it would gather speed and 
become “too fast” to stay that close 
to the Sun. It would then start go
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
ing away from the Sun — not in a 
straight line, of course — and reach 
again the orbit of the planet from 
which it was fired. 
To summarize this in more precise language, one might say that 
the rocket which added velocity to 
the orbital velocity of its planet 
will have an aphelion farther from 
the Sun than that planet, but that 
its perihelion will be in the orbit of 
the planet of origin. Conversely, the 
rocket which subtracted velocity 
from the orbital velocity of its 
planet will have its perihelion 
closer to the Sun than that planet, 
but its aphelion will be in the orbit 
of the planet of origin. 
TTAVING taken care of these 
fundamentals first, we can 
look at what is known about the 
Russian rocket. In the American 
press, it was usually referred to as 
Lunik and it is even possible that 
some Russians used the same term. 
Originally, however, it did not have 
a name at all, but was simply called 
Rakyeta na luna, “Rocket to the 
Moon.” After the shot, the Russians 
did advance an official name, namely Metchta (the accent is on the 
fa, the second syllable). 
The main trouble with this name 
is that it cannot be translated easily. 
A “simplified dictionary” that I 
checked was indeed simplified and 
just said “Dream.” Well, to me, a 
dream is something that occurs 
when I am asleep. Metchta is not 
that kind of dream, but another 
kind. “She’s a dream,” “the American dream,” “Dreamboat” and 
other expressions in English show 
that we and the Russians have the 
same idea in mind — “Daydream,” 
meaning a flight of fancy or aspiration or something approaching perfection. 
The rocket Daydream was fired 
at dawn on January 2, 1959, presumably from the rocket range in 
the Kyzyl Kum Desert. It was 
aimed and/or guided at the Moon, 
which looks quite large but, with a 
diameter of 2160 miles at a distance of 240,000 miles, is not a 
very big target 
The rocket missed. It is now 
known that it passed the surface 
of the Moon at a distance of 4660 
miles. The instrument load of 797 
pounds remained attached to the 
empty casing of the top stage; together, they weighed about 4030 
pounds. 
Now if you aim a rocket at our 
moon, only three different cases 
are possible. 
The first one is the simplest (but 
also the least likely), namely that 
you hit. 
The probability is somewhat better that you miss by a very narrow 
margin of a few hundred miles. In 
that case, the Moon’s gravitational 
field would pull the rocket around 
the Moon in a hyperbola. At any 
event, that is what a textbook is

curve described by the rocket will 
not be a nice mathematical hyperbola. This curve would result only 
if the Moon were kind enough to 
stand still while it pulls the rocket 
around itself. In reality, the Moon 
keeps moving at the rate of about 
0.6 miles per second, so the curve 
will be distorted. Its so-called “escape leg” will point in the general 
direction of the Earth, but would 
miss Earth by a very large margin. 
Then the rocket would go into an 
orbit around the Sun. 
The third possibility, and the 
one with the highest probability, is 
that the rocket will miss the Moon 
by a large margin. Large, in this 
case, means that the distance between rocket and Moon even at 
closest approach will be so large 
that the Moon’s gravitational field 
will not influence the orbit of the 
rocket very much. The rocket, in 
this case, will go into an orbit 
around the Sun directly. This is 
what actually happened — to 
Metchta, that is. It is also what is 
happening to our lunar probes. 
SINCE the rocket was fired in 
^ the direction of the Earth’s 
movement, it at first raced ahead 
of the Earth before starting to drift 
outward in the Solar system. As 
it receded from the Sun, its velocity was reduced, and by April or 
May, the Earth, continuing on its 
own orbit at a reasonably steady 
rate, will overtake the rocket. 
The precise date is not known at 
the moment of writing, but in late 
spring, the Sun, the Earth and the 
rocket Daydream will form a 
straight line momentarily. Astronomically speaking, the rocket will 
be “in opposition.” 
The aphelion of the rocket is at 
the moment estimated as being 
122.5 million miles from the Sim. 
This should be reached late in August. Then the rocket will come 
closer to the Sun again and should 
reach its perihelion 447 days after 
passing the Moon. The perihelion 
will be, of course, where the Earth 
was when the rocket was fired, near 
the perihelion of the Earth’s orbit, 
91.5 million miles from the Sun. 
I hope you have looked at the 
diagram in the meantime (Fig. 1). 
It shows the orbits of Earth and 
Mars, of asteroid 433-Eros and of 
Metchta drawn to scale. It can be 
seen that the orbit of the rocket 
crosses neither the orbit of Mars 
nor the orbit of Eros. It will come 
considerably closer to both than 
the Earth does, of course. The 
closest possible approach between 
Earth and Eros is 14 million miles. 
Metchta and Eros can, theoretically, come as close as about eight million miles. Likewise, Metchta 
could come as close to Mars as 
about 20 million miles. These two 
“abouts” with reference to the 
closest approach are due to the 
fact that the orbit of Metchta is 
not yet definitely established. 
Even if the rocket’s instruments 
were still reporting, the orbit into 
which Metchta was thrown is not 
particularly good, as regards possible astronomical results. Personally I have the feeling that the Russians counted on hitting the Moon. 
The reason for this opinion is this : 
Normally one would expect to 
miss and it would then be a most 
interesting experiment to see over 
what distance signals from the 
rocket can still be received. Signals over a distance of a million 
miles are very likely. Beyond that, 
one would have to see. 
It would be only logical, therefore, to equip such a rocket with 
as much battery power as possible, 
so that the signal will be broadcast 
for as long as possible. But the batteries of Metchta went dead quite 
soon after the rocket passed the 
Moon. This is why I think the Russians counted on a hit. 
D EFORE I say something about 
the future of Metchta, I have 
to make one more remark about the 
diagram. If the rocket had been 
somewhat faster, its orbit might extend out far enough to touch the 
orbit of Mars. How close to Mars 
could it come in this case? The answer is that there would still be 
nearly three million miles between 
the rocket and the planet, because 
the rocket travels in the plane of 
the Earth’s orbit around the Sun. 
This is not the same as the plane 
of the orbit of Mars — the two are 
inclined to each other, and at the 
distance of Mars, the planes of the 
two orbits are that far apart from 
each other. 
Well, Metchta is now in orbit 
around the Sun, without the slightest danger of being melted. The orbital period is 447 days or just 
about 15 months. After 15 months, 
the rocket will be in Earth’s orbit 
at the point where Earth is in early 
January. But fifteen months from 
the firing date, Earth will be three 
months farther along in its orbit — 
it will just have passed the “March 
1 line.” In other words, Earth will 
be farther and farther from the 
place where Metchta touches 
Earth’s orbit; Earth will have 
crossed the “June 1 line” the next 
time Metchta comes to Earth’s orbit, and so forth. 
Later on, of course, they come 
closer together again, and during 
the winter of 1963-1964, something 
may happen. We don’t know yet 
what it will be. The rocket needs 
four times 447 days or 1788 days 
for four complete revolutions. The 
Earth needs five times 365 Vi days 
or 1827 Vi days to complete five 
revolutions. The difference is just 
about 40 days, which is to say that 
Earth will reach a specific point in 
its orbit 40 days later than the 
rocket does. 
But, as the diagram shows, the 
two orbits lead into each other very 
gradually. 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
During that winter, the rocket 
will be rather close to Earth for 
some time. Naturally Earth’s gravity will go to work on it. It is most 
unlikely that the rocket will be 
forced to re-enter the atmosphere 
and burn up. But it is likely that it 
will be forced into a new orbit by 
the Earth then. Since the Earth 
will be, so to speak, behind the 
rocket, the rocket will be slowed 
down. 
This should result in another orbit that is smaller than the one 
traveled by the rocket right now. 
But this is as much as can be said 
at the moment 
ANY QUESTIONS? 
Recently, a group of friends and 
I were discussing the fact that a 
speed of 25,000 m.pK was necessary for a vehicle to escape the 
gravitational pull of the Earth. As 
the discussion progressed, I came 
up with the comment that if we 
had a propulsion system which 
could transport a vehicle at a lower 
speed but for an indefinite period 
of time, the 25,000 m.p.h. would 
not be necessary . Is it possible 
for a rocket to take off and travel, 
say, 5,000 m.pJn. for an indefinite 
period of time and still overcome 
Earth’s gravity? 
James Sevchik 
Justice, Illinois 
This question conies up at 
regular intervals and I am an
swering it in public in the hope 
of getting it settled for some 
time. 
There are several flaws in the 
reasoning developed. Apparently the impression is that a rocket 
must reach 25,000 m.p.h. and 
keep going at that rate to escape 
from the Earth’s gravitational 
pull. This, of course, is not so. 
The figure of 25,000 m.p.h., or 
better 7 miles per second, applies to the surface of the Earth. 
After takeoff, the vehicle, just 
coasting, will be slowed down by 
the Earth’s gravitational attraction. At first it will lose 32 feet 
per second for every second 
elapsed. Then as it gets farther 
away from the Earth — after all, 
it moves at 7 miles per second 
minus a few times 32 feet per 
second — the gravitational attraction grows weaker and the 
vehicle loses only 30 feet per 
second for every second elapsed. 
At a still greater distance, the 
loss per second is down to 20 
feet per second, or 10 feet per 
second, or 2 feet 3 inches per 
second. The vehicle has been 
considerably slowed down too, 
to be sure, but it still has the upper hand. Only in theoretical infinity will it be brought to a 
standstill, but when at an infinite 
distance it has, of course, escaped from the Earth. 
Now this implies that the 
velocity required would be less 
if the takeoff took place some 
distance from the surface This 
actually is what happens. While 
a rocket is climbing, it is building up speed, but it is also gaining altitude. If the rocket needs 
long enough to reach an altitude 
of, say, 1000 miles to build up 
the necessary speed, it no longer 
needs to build up to the full 7 
miles per second. 
It saves fuel to reach the necessary velocity as soon as possible (in practice: after traversing the atmosphere) for the 
slower the rocket, the more fuel 
is wasted. 
Suppose you have a rocket 
weighing one ton with a rocket 
motor developing a thrust of 
one ton. This rocket would just 
hover, and begin to rise solely 
because it would lose weight due 
to fuel consumption, while the 
thrust remains one ton. Now 
imagine that the same rocket 
burns its fuel twice as fast, so 
that it will rise from the first moment on, having a thrust of two 
tons. Naturally the fuel does not 
last as long, but it can easily be 
visualized that the rocket would 
climb much higher than the first 
one. 
By rising slowly, you just give 
the Earth’s gravitational attraction more time to do its dirty 
work. 
We read almost every day in 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
the newspapers about escape from 
the Earth. Could we escape from 
the Solar System? 
Sven I. Ivarsson 
Washington, D. C. 
Yes, we could, provided the 
ship is fast enough. There is a 
very simple relationship. Pick 
the planet from which you want 
to take off. Check its orbital velocity. Multiply said orbital velocity by the square root of two. 
That’s the velocity you need. 
This is a feminine question maybe. But I just found out that you 
know a lot about animals and have 
written books about animals, living 
and extinct. Would you mind telling me whether there is an animal 
about which you would like information? If I can, I’ll try to supply 
it, being a librarian myself. 
Estelle Landers 
Oak Park, 111. 
Well, thank you for your 
kind offer, dear lady. I am only 
sorry that you won’t be able to 
supply the information I want. 
It simply seems not to be 
known, unless somebody published something quite recently 
that has not yet come to my attention. The animal about which 
I would like to know more is one 
of those strange “living fossils.” 
Its scientific name is Galeopithecus ; its English name is “Flying 
Lemur.” Its habitat is southeast 
Asia. In appearance, Galeopithe
71 
cus would remind Americans of 
their own “flying squirrels,” 
though it is larger. But the “flying squirrels” are rodents and 
there is just no way of saying 
what Galeopithecus is, beyond 
the obvious statement that it is 
3 mammal. 
It has a larger flying skin than 
the flying squirrel, for the flying 
skin extends not only between 
fore- and hindlegs on each 'side, 
there also are two triangles of 
flying skin from the “wrists” to 
the sides of the head. Moreover, 
at the other end, the tail is incorporated into the flying skin. We 
know that it is 18 inches long 
and there must be males and females. But we don’t know how 
the young are brought up. We 
don’t even know what the adults 
eat. The fact that they are strictly nocturnal does not help the 
investigation. 
One word of caution if you 
really want to check. You may 
find an old paper by Professor 
Florentino Ameghino of Argentina about a fossil Galeopithecus. Don’t waste time unearthing this paper; it was later 
proved to be a mistake, for the 
fossil was not a Galeopithecug. 
Its ancestors are as unknown as 
its dietary habits. 
1 would like to suggest an article 
on the evolution of Man from the 
monkey. What proof do some sci
entists have to make them believe 
this? 
Dave Shtogryn 
Thor old, Ontario 
Well, this would have to be a 
book rather than an article. But 
I can rectify what seem to be a 
few wrong conceptions right 
now. Nobody has ever suggested 
that any of the living monkeys, 
or apes, are ancestors of Man. 
If you compare the skeletons 
of the three living apes, gorilla, 
chimpanzee and orang-utan, 
with the skeleton of a man, you 
will notice how similar they are. 
Every bone of one is matched by 
a corresponding bone of the 
other. Only the relative sizes and 
proportions differ. 
One especially interesting 
point was brought out many 
years ago by the English scientist Huxley. If you compare 
these skeletons in detail, you’ll 
find, to your surprise, that the 
differences between the skeleton 
of the chimpanzee and the 
orang-utan are greater than the 
differences between chimpanzee 
and Man, or orang-utan and 
Man. 
All of this indicates relationship. But the apes are not ancestral to Man. What has been 
stated by scientists for the last 
hundred years is that Man and 
the apes must have a common 
ancestor.

THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS 
By JIM HARMON 
Now was the captain's chance to 
prove he knew less than the crew 
T HERE was nothing showing on the video screen. 
That was why we were 
looking at it so analytically. 
“Transphasia, that’s what it is,” 
Ordinary Spaceman Quade stated 
with a definite thrust of his angular 
jaw in my direction. “You can take 
my word on that, Captain Gavin.” 
“Can’t,” I told him. “I can’t trust 
your opinion. I can’t trust any
all their lives hung upon it I 
Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 
thing. That’s why I’m Captain.” 
“You’ll get over feeling like 
that.” 
“I know. Then I’ll become First 
Officer.” 
“But look at that screen, sir,” 
Quade said with an emphatic swing 
of his scarred arm. “I’ve seen blank 
scanning like that before and you 
haven’t — it’s your first trip. This 
always means transphasia — cortex 
THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS 
dissolution, motor area feedback, 
the Aitchell Effect— call it anything 
you like, it’s still transphasia.” 
“I know what transphasia is,” I 
said moderately. “It means an electrogravitational disturbance of incoming sense data, rechanneling it 
to the wrong receptive areas. Besides the human brain, it also effects electronic equipment, like 
radar and television.” 
“Obviously.” Quade glanced disgustedly at the screen. 
“Too obvious. This time it might 
not be a familiar condition of many 
planetary gravitational fields. On 
this planet, that blank kinescope 
may mean our Big Brother kites 
were knocked down by hostile natives.” 
“You are plain wrong, Captain. 
Traditionally, alien races never interfere with our explorations. Generally, they are so alien to us they 
can’t even recognize our existence.” 
T DREW myself up to my full 
height — and noticed in irritation it was still an inch less than 
Quade’s. “I don’t understand you 
men. Look at yourself, Quade. 
You’ve been busted to Ordinary 
Spaceman for just that kind of 
thinking, for relying on tradition, 
on things that have worked before. 
Not only your thinking is slipshod, 
you’ve grown careless about everything else, even your own life.” 
“Just a minute, Captain. I’ve 
never been ‘busted.’ In the Explor
74 
ation Service, we regard Ordinary 
Spaceman as our highest rank. 
With my hazard pay, I get more 
hard cash than you do, and I’m 
closer to retirement.” 
“That’s a shallow excuse for complacency.” 
“Complacency! I’ve seen ten 
thousand wonders in twenty years 
of space, with a million variations. 
But the patterns repeat themselves. 
We learn to know what to expect, 
so maybe we can’t maintain the 
reactionary caution the service 
likes in officers.” 
“I resent the word ‘reactionary,’ 
Spaceman! In civilian life, I was a 
lapidary and I learned the value 
of deliberation. But I never got too 
cataleptic to tap a million-dollar 
gem, which is more than my contemporaries can say, many of ’em.” 
“Captain Gavin,” Quade said patiently, “you must realize that an 
outsider like you, among a crew of 
skilled spacemen, can never be 
more than a figurehead.” 
Was this the way I was to be 
treated? Why, this man had deliberately insulted me, his captain. I 
controlled myself, remembering 
the familiarity that had always 
existed between members of a crew 
working under close conditions, 
from the time of the ancient submarines and the first orbital ships. 
“Quade,” I said, “there’s only one 
way for us to find out which of us 
is right about the cause of our scanning blackout” 
“We go out and find the reason.” 
“Exactly. We go. You and me. I 
hope you can stand my company.” 
“I’m not sure I can,” he answered 
reluctantly. “My hazard pay 
doesn’t cover exploring with 
rookies. With all due respect, Captain.” 
I clapped him on the shoulder. 
“But, man, you have just been telling me all we had to worry about 
was common transphasia. A man 
with your experience could protect 
himself and cover even a rookie, 
under such familiar conditions — 
right?” 
“Yes, sir, I suppose I could,” 
Quade said, bitterly aware he had 
lost out somewhere and hoping that 
it wasn’t the start of a trend. 
??¥ OOKS okay to me,” I said. 
Quade passed a gauntlet 
over his faceplate. “It’s real. I can 
blur it with a smudged visor. When 
it blurs, it’s solid.” 
The landscape beyond the black 
corona left by our landing rockets 
was unimpressive. The rocky desert 
was made up of silicon and iron 
oxide, so it looked much the same 
as a terrestrial location. Yellowishwhite sand ran up to and around 
reddish brown rock clawing into 
the pink sunlight. 
“I don’t understand it,” Quade 
admitted. “Transphasia hits you a 
foul as soon as you let it into the 
airlock.” 
“Apparently, Quade, this thing 
is going to creep up on us.” 
“Don’t sound smug, Captain. It’s 
pitty-pattying behind you too.” 
The keening call across the surface of consciousness postponed my 
reply. 
The wail was ominously forlorn, 
defiant of description. I turned my 
head around slowly inside my helmet, not even sure that I had heard 
it 
But what else can you do with a 
wail but hear it? 
Quade nodded. “I’ve felt this before. It usually hits sooner. Let’s 
trace it.” 
“I don’t like this,” I admitted. 
“It’s not at all what I expected from 
what you said about transphasia. It 
must be something else.” 
“It couldn’t be anything else. I 
know what to expect You don’t. 
You may begin smelling sensations, 
tasting sounds, hearing sights, seeing tastes, touching odors — or any 
other combination. Don’t let it 
bother you.” 
“Of course not. I’ll soothe my 
nerves by counting little shocks of 
lanolin jumping over a loud fence.” 
Quade grinned behind his faceplate. “Good idea.” 
“Then you can have it. I’m going to try keeping my eyes open 
and staying alive.” 
There was no reply. 
His expression was tart and 
greasy despite all his light talk, and 
I knew mine was the same. I tested 
the security rope between our pres
75 
THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS 
sure suits. It was a taut and virile 
bass. 
We scaled a staccato of rocks, 
our suits grinding pepper against 
our hides. 
The musk summit rose before us, 
a minor-key horizon with a shifting 
treble for as far as I could smell. 
It was primitive beauty that made 
you feel shocking pink inside. The 
most beautiful vista I had ever 
tasted, it couldn’t be dulled even 
by the sensation of beef broth under my skin. 
“Is this transphasia?” I asked in 
awe. 
“It always has been before,” 
Quade remarked. “Ready to swallow your words about this being 
something an old hand wouldn’t 
recognize, Captain?” 
“I’m swallowing no words until 
I find out precisely how they taste 
here.” 
“Not a bad taste. They’re pretty. 
Or haven’t you noticed?” 
“Quade, you’re right! About the 
colors anyway. This reminds me of 
an illiscope recording from a cybernetic translator.” 
“It should. I don’t suppose we 
could understand each other if it 
wasn’t for our morphistudy courses 
in reading cross-sense translations 
of Centauri blushtalk and the like.” 
It became difficult to understand 
him, difficult to try talking in the 
face of such splendor. You never 
really appreciate colors until you 
smell them for the first time. 
Q UADE was as conversational 
as ever, though. “I can’t see 
irregularities occurring in a gravitational field. We must have compensated for the transphasia while 
we still had a point of reference, the 
solid reality of the spaceship. But 
out here, where all we have to hang 
onto is each other, our concept of 
reality goes bang and deflates to a 
tired joke.” 
Before I could agree with one of 
his theories for once, a streak of 
spice shot past us. It bounced back 
tangily and made a bitter rip between the two of us. There was no 
time to judge its size, if it had size, 
or its decibel range, or its caloric 
count, before a small, sharp pain 
dug in and dwindled down to nothing in one long second. 
The new odor pattern in my 
head told me Quade was saying 
something I couldn’t quite make 
out. 
Quade then pulled me in the direction of the nasty little pain. 
“Wait a minute, Spaceman!” I 
bellowed. “Where the devil do you 
think you’re dragging me? Halt! 
That’s a direct order.” 
He stopped. “Don’t you want to 
find out what that was? This is an 
exploration party, you know, sir.” 
“I’m not sure I do want to find 
out what that was just now. I didn’t 
like the feel of it. But the important 
thing is for us not to get any further 
from the ship.” 
“That’s important, Captain?” 
THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS 
“To the best of my judgment, 
yes. This — condition — didn’t begin until we got so far away from 
the spacer — in time or distance. I 
don’t want it to get any worse. It’s 
troublesome not to know black 
from white, but it would be a downright inconvenience not to know 
which way is up.” 
“Not for an experienced spaceman,” Quade griped. “I’m used to 
free-fall.” 
But he turned back. 
“Just a minute,” I said. “There 
was something strange up ahead. I 
want to see if short-range radar can 
get through our electrogravitational jamming here.” 
I took a sighting. My helmet set 
projected the pattern on the cornea. 
Sweetness building up to a stab of 
pure salt — those were the blips. 
Beside me, there was a thin 
thread of violet. Quade had whistled. He was reading the map too. 
The slope fell away sharply in 
front of us, becoming a deep gorge. 
There was something broken and 
twisted at the bottom, something 
we had known for an instant as a 
streak of spice. 
“There’s one free-fall,” I said, 
“where you wouldn’t live long 
enough to get used to it.” 
He said nothing on the route 
back to the spacer. 
KNOW all about this sort of 
thing, Gav,” First Officer 
Nagurski said expansively. He was 
rubbing the well-worn ears of our 
beagle mascot, Bruce. A heavy tail 
thudded on the steel deck from 
time to time. 
My finger could barely get in the 
chafing band of my regulation collar. I was hot and tired, fresh — in 
only the chronological sense — from 
a pressure suit. 
“What do you know all about, 
Nagurski? Dogs? Spacemen? 
Women? Transphasia?” 
“Yes,” he answered casually. 
“But I had immediate reference to 
our current psychophysiological 
phenomenon.” 
I collapsed into the swivel in 
front of the chart table. “First off, 
let’s hear what you know about — 
never mind, make it dogs.” 
“Take Bruce, for example, 
then—” 
“No, thanks. I was wondering 
why you did.” 
“I didn’t.” His dark, round face 
was bland. “Bruce picked me. Followed me home one night in Chicago Port. The dog or the man who 
picks his own master is the most 
content.” 
“Bruce is content,” I admitted. 
“He couldn’t be any more content 
and still be alive. But I’m not sure 
that theory works out with men. 
We’d have anarchy if I tried to let 
these Starbucks pick their own master.” 
“I had no trouble when I was a 
captain,” Nagurski said. “Ease the 
reins on the men. Just offer them 
your advice, your guidance. They 
will soon see why the service selected you as captain; they will 
pick you themselves.” 
“Did your crew voluntarily elect 
you as their leader?” 
“Of course they did, Gav. I’m 
an old hand at controlling crews.” 
“Then why are you First Officer 
under me now?” 
He blinked, then decided to 
laugh. “I’ve been in space a good 
many years. I really wanted to relax a little bit more. Besides, the 
increase in hazard pay was actually 
more than my salary as a captain. 
I’m a notch nearer retirement too.” 
“Tell me, did you always feel this 
way about letting the men select 
their own leader?” 
NAGURSKI BROUGHT out a 
pipe. He would have a pipe, I decided. 
“No, not always. I was like you 
at first. Fresh from the cosmic energy test lab, suspicious of everything, 
trying to tell the old hands what 
to do. But I learned that they are 
pretty smart boys; they know what 
they are doing. You can rely on 
them absolutely.” 
I leaned forward, elbows on 
knees. “Let me tell you a thing, Nagurski. Your trust of these damnfool spacemen is why you are no 
longer a captain. You can’t trust 
anything out here in space, much 
less human nature. Even I know 
that much!” 
He was pained. “If you don’t 
trust the men, they won’t trust you, 
Gav.” 
“They don’t have to trust me. All 
they have to do is obey me or, by 
Jupiter, get frozen stiff and thawed 
out just in time for court-marshal 
back home. Listen,” I continued 
earnestly, “these men aren’t going 
to think of me — of us, the officers, 
as their leaders. As far as the crew 
is concerned, Ordinary Spaceman 
Quade is the best man on this ship.” 
“He is a good man,” Nagurski 
said. “You mustn’t be jealous of his 
status.” 
The dog growled. He must have 
sensed what I almost did to Nagurski. 
“Never mind that for now,” I said 
wearily. “What was your idea for 
getting our exploration parties 
through this transphasia?” 
“There’s only one idea for that,” 
said Quade, ducking his long head 
and stepping through the connecting hatch. “With the Captain’s permission . .” 
“Go ahead, Quade, tell him,” Nagurski invited. 
“There’s only one way to wade 
through transphasia with any reliability,” Quade told me. “You 
keep some kind of physical contact 
with the spaceship. Parties are 
strung out on guide line, like we 
were, but the cable has to be run 
back and made fast to the hull.” 
“How far can we run it back?” 
Quade shrugged. “Miles.” 
THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS 
“How many?” 
“We have three miles of cable. 
As long as you can feel, taste, see, 
smell or hear that rope anchoring 
you to home, you aren’t lost.” 
“Three miles isn’t good enough. 
We don’t have enough fuel to 
change sites that often. You can’t 
use the drive in a gravitational 
field, you know.” 
“What else can we do, Captain?” 
Nagurski asked puzzledly. 
“You’ve said that the spaceship 
is our only protection from transphasia. Is that it?” 
Quade gave a curt nod. 
“Then,” I told them, “we will 
have to start tearing apart this 
ship.” 
C ERGE ANT-MAJOR Hoffman 
^ and his team were doing a good 
job of ripping out the side of the 
afterhold. Through the portal I 
could see the suited men expertly 
guiding the huge curved sections 
on their ray projectors. 
“Cannibalizing is dangerous.” 
Nagurski put his pipe in his teeth 
and shook his head disapprovingly. 
“Spaceships have parts as interchangeable as Erector sets. We can 
take apart the tractors and put our 
ship back together again after we 
complete the survey.” 
“You can’t assemble a jigsaw 
puzzle if some of the pieces are 
missing.” 
“You can’t get a complete picture, but you can get a good idea 
of what it looks like. We can take 
off in a reasonable facsimile of a 
spaceship.” 
“Not,” he persisted, “if too many 
parts are missing.” 
“Nagurski, if you are looking for 
a job safer than space exploration, 
why don’t you go back to testing 
cosmic bomb shelters?” 
Nagurski flushed. “Look here, 
Captain, you are being too damned 
cautious. There is a way one handles the survey of a planet like this, 
and this isn’t the way.” 
“It’s my way. You heard what 
Quade said. You know it yourself. 
The men have to have something 
tangible to hang onto out there. One 
slender cable isn’t enough of an 
edge on sensory anarchy. If the 
product of their own technological 
civilization can keep them sane, I 
say let ’em take a part of that environment with them.” 
“In departing from standard procedure that we have learned to 
trust, you are risking more than a 
few men — you risk the whole mission in gambling so much of the 
ship. A captain doesn’t take chances 
like that!” 
“I never said I wouldn’t take 
chances. But I’m not going to take 
stupid chances. I might be doing the 
wrong thing, but I can see you 
would be doing it wrong.” 
“You know nothing about space, 
Captain! You have to trust us.” 
“That’s it exactly, First Officer 
Nagurski,” I said sociably. “If you 
lazy, lax, complacent slobs want to 
do something in a particular way, I 
know it has to be wrong.” 
I turned and found Wallace, the 
personnel man, standing in the 
hatchway. 
“Pardon, Captain, but would you 
say we also lacked initiative?” 
“I would,” I answered levelly. 
“Then you’ll be interested to 
hear that Spaceman Quade took a 
suit and a cartographer unit. He’s 
out there somewhere, alone.” 
“The idiot!” I yelped. “Everyone 
needs a partner out there. Send out 
a team to follow his cable and drag 
him in here by it.” 
“He didn’t hook on a cable, Captain,” Wallace said. “I suppose he 
intended to go beyond the threemile limit as you demanded.” 
“Shut up, Wallace. You don’t 
have to like me, but you can’t twist 
what I said as long as I command 
this spacer.” 
“Cool off, Gav,” Nagurski advised me. “It’s been done before. 
Anybody else would have been a 
fool to go out alone, but Quade is 
the most experienced man we have. 
He knows transphasia. Trust him.” 
“I trusted him too far by letting 
him run around loose. He needs a 
leash in more ways than one, and 
I’m going to put one on him.” 
T^OR me, it was a nightmare. I lay 
down in my cabin and thought. 
I had to think things through very 
carefully. One mistake was too 
many for me. My worst fear had 
been that someday I would overlook one tiny flaw and ruin a gem. 
Now I might have ruined an exploration and destroyed a man, not 
a stone, because I had missed the 
flaw. 
No one but a reckless fool would 
have gone out alone on a strange 
planet with a terrifying phenomenon, but I’d had enough evidence 
to see that space exploration made 
a man a reckless fool by doing 
things on one planet he had once 
found safe and wise on some other 
world. 
The thought intruded itself: why 
hadn’t I recognized this before I 
let Quade escape to almost certain death? Wasn’t it because I 
wanted him dead, because I resented the crew’s resentment of my 
authority, and recognized in him 
the leader and symbol of this resentment? 
I threw away that idea along 
with my half-used cigarette. It 
might very well be true, but how 
did that help now? 
I had to think. 
I was going after him, that was 
certain. Not only for humane reasons — he was the most important 
member of the crew. With him 
around, there were only two opinions, his and mine. Without him, 
I’d have endless opinions to contend with. 
But it wouldn’t do any good to go 
out no better equipped than he. 
THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS 
There was no time to wait for tractors to be built if we wanted to 
reach him alive, and we certainly 
couldn’t reach him five or ten miles 
out with our three miles of safety 
line. We would have to go in spacesuits. 
But how would that leave us any 
better off than Quade? 
Why was Quade vulnerable in 
his spacesuit, as I knew from experience he would be? 
How could we be less vulnerable, 
or preferably invulnerable? 
“CAPTAIN, YOU got nothing to 
worry about,” Quartermaster Farley said. He patted a space helmet 
paternally. “You got yourself a selfcontained environment. The suit’s 
eye looks into yours at the arteries 
in the back of your eyeball so it 
can read your amber corpuscles and 
feed you your oxygen in the right 
amounts; you’re a bottle-fed baby. 
If transphasia gets you seeing limburger, turn on the radar and you’re 
air-conditioned as an igloo. Nothing 
short of a cosmic blast can dent 
that hide. You got it made.” 
“You are right,” I said, “only 
transphasia comes right through 
these air-fast joints.” 
■^Something strange about the 
trance, Captain,” Farley said darkly. “Any spaceman can tell you 
that. Things we don’t understand.” 
“I’m talking about something we 
do understand — sound. These suits 
perfectly soundproof?” 
“Well, you can pick up sound by 
conduction. Like putting two helmets together and talking without 
using radio. You can’t insulate 
enough to block out all sound and 
still have a man-shaped suit. You 
have—” 
“I know. Then you have something like a tractor or a miniature 
spaceship. There isn’t time for that 
We will have to live with the 
sound.” 
“What do you think he’s going 
to hear out there, Captain? We’d 
like to find one of those beautiful 
sirens on some planet believe me, 
but—” 
“I believe you,” I said quickly. 
“Let’s leave it at that. I don’t know 
what he will hear; what’s worrying 
me is how he’ll hear it in what 
sensory medium. I hope the sound 
doesn’t blind him. His radar is his 
only chance.” 
“How do you figure on getting a 
better edge yourself, sir?” 
“I have the idea, but not the 
word for it. Tonal compensation, I 
suppose. If you can’t shut out the 
noise, we’ll have to drown it out.” 
Farley nodded. “Beat like a telephone time signal?” 
“That would do it.” 
“It would do something else. It 
would drive you nuts.” 
T SHRUGGED. “It might be distracting.” 
“Captain, take my word for it,” 
argued Farley. “Constant sonic 
feedback inside a spacesuit will set 
you rocking against the grain.” 
“Devise some regular system of 
interruptions,” I suggested. 
“Then the pattern will drive you 
crazy. Maybe in a few months, with 
luck, I could plan some harmonic 
scale you could tolerate—” 
“We don’t have a few months,” I 
said. “How about music? There’s a 
harmonic scale for you, and we can 
endure it, some of it. Figaro and 
Asleep in the Cradle of the Deep 
can compensate for high-pitched 
outside temperatures, and Flight 
of the Bumble Bee to block bass 
notes.” 
Farley nodded. “Might work. I 
can program the tapes from the 
library." 
“Good. There’s one more thing 
— how are our stores of medicinal 
liquor?” 
Farley paled. “Captain, are you 
implying that I should be running 
short on alcohol? Where do you 
get off suggesting a thing like that?” 
“I’m getting off at the right stop, 
apparently,” I sighed. “Okay, Farley, no evasions. In plain figures, 
how much drinking alcohol do we 
have left?” 
The quartermaster slumped a 
bit. “Twenty-one liters unbroken. 
One more about half full.” 
“Half full? How did that ever 
happen? I mean you had some left? 
We’ll take this up later. I want you 
to run it through the synthesizer to 
get some light wine ...” 
“Light wine?” Farley looked in 
pain. “Not whiskey, brandy, beer?” 
“Light wine. Then ration it out 
to some of the men.” 
“Ration it to the men!” 
“That’s an accurate interpretation of my orders.” 
“But, sir,” Farley protested, “you 
don’t give alcohol to the crew in the 
middle of a mission. It’s not done. 
What reason can you have?” 
“To sharpen their taste and olfactory senses. We can turn up or 
block out sound. We can use radar 
to extend our sight, but the Space 
Service hasn’t yet developed anything to make spacemen taste or 
smell better.” 
“They are going to smell like a 
herd of winos,” Farley said. “I don’t 
like to think how they would taste.” 
“It’s an entirely practical idea. 
Tea-tasters used to drink almondand-barley water to sharpen their 
senses. I’ve observed that wine 
helps you appreciate culinary art 
more. Considering the mixed-up 
sensory data under transphasia, 
wine may help us to see where we 
are going.” 
“Yes, sir,” Farley said obediently. “I’ll give spacemen a few quarts 
of wine, telling them to use it carefully for scientific purposes only, 
and then they will be able to see 
where they are going. Yes, sir.” 
I turned to leave, then paused 
briefly. “You can come along, Farley. I’m sure you want to see that 
we don’t waste any of the stuff.” 
THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS 
44 r p HERE they are!” Nagurski 
called. “Quade’s footsteps 
again, just beyond that rocky 
ridge.” 
The landscape was rich chocolate ice cream smothered with 
chocolate syrup, caramel, peanuts 
and maple syrup, eaten while you 
smoked an old, mellow Havana. 
The footsteps were faint traces of 
whipped cream across the dark, rich 
taste of the planet. 
I splashed some wine from my 
drinking tube against the roof of 
my mouth to sharpen my taste. It 
brought out the footsteps sharper. 
It also made the landscape more 
of a teen-ager’s caloric nightmare. 
The four of us pulled ourselves 
closer together by reeling in more 
of our safety line. Farley and Hoffman, Nagurski and myself, we were 
cabled together. It gave us a larger 
hunk of reality to hold onto. Even 
so, things wavered for me during a 
wisp of time. 
We stumbled over the ridge, feeling out the territory. It was a sticky 
job crawling over a melting, chunkstyle Hershey bar. I was thankful 
for the invigorating Sousa march 
blasting inside my helmet. Before 
the tape had cut in, kicked on by 
the decibel gauge, I had heard or 
felt something dark and ominous in 
the outside air. 
“Yes, this is definitely the trail 
of Quail,” Nagurski said soberly. 
“This is serious business. I must 
ask whoever has been giggling on 
this channel to shut up. Pardon me, 
Captain. You weren’t giggling, sir?” 
“I have never giggled in my life, 
Nagurski” 
“Yes, sir. That’s what we all 
thought.” 
A moment later, Nagurski added, 
“Anyway, I just noticed it was my 
shelf — my, that is, self.” 
The basso profundo performing 
Figaro on my headset climbed to 
a girlish shriek. A sliver of ice. 
This was the call Quade and I had 
first heard as we were about to 
troop over a cliff. I dug in my heels. 
“Take a good look around, boys,” 
I said. “What do you see?” 
“Quail,” Nagurski replied. 
“That’s what I see.” 
“You,” I said carefully, “have 
been in space a long time. Look 
again.” 
“I see our old buddy, Quail.” 
I took another slosh of burgundy 
and peered up ahead. It was Quade. 
A man in a spacesuit, faceplate in 
the dust, two hundred yards ahead. 
Grudgingly I stepped forward, 
out of the shadow of the ridge. A 
hysterically screaming wind rocked 
me on my toes. We pushed on sluggishly to Quade’s side, moving to 
the tempo of Pomp and Circumstance. 
Farley lugged Quade over on his 
back and read his gauges. 
The Quartermaster rose with 
grim deliberation, and hiccuped. 
“Better get him back to the spaceship fast I’ve seen this kind of 
thing before with transphasia. His 
body cooled down because of the 
screaming wind — psychosomatic 
reaction — and his heating circuits 
compensated for the cool flesh. The 
poor devil’s got frostbite and heat 
prostration.” 
THE FOUR of us managed to haul 
Quade back by using the powered 
joints in our suits. Hoffman suggested that he had once seen an injured man walked back inside his 
suit like a robot, but it was a delicate adjustment, controlling power 
circuits from outside a suit. It was 
too much for us — we were too 
tired, too numb, too drunk. 
At first sight of the spacer in the 
distance, transphasia left me with 
only a chocolate-tasting pink afterimage on my retina. It was now 
showing bare skeleton from cannibalization for tractor parts, but it 
looked good to me, like home. 
The wailing call sounded 
through the amber twilight. 
I realized that I was actually 
hearing it for the first time. 
The alien stood between us and 
the ship. It was a great pot-bellied 
lizard as tall as a man. Its sound 
came from a flat, vibrating beaver 
tail. Others of its kind were coming into view behind it. 
“Stand your ground,” I warned 
the others thickly. “They may be 
dangerous.” 
Quade sat up on our crisscross 
litter of arms. “Aliens can’t be hos
tile. Ethnic impossibility. I’ll show 
you.” 
Quade was delirious and we were 
drunk. He got away from us and 
jogged toward the herd. 
“Let’s give him a hand!” Farley 
shouted. “We’ll take us a specimen!” 
I couldn’t stop them. Being in 
Alpine rope with them, I went 
along. At the time, it even seemed 
vaguely like a good idea. 
As we lumbered toward them, 
the aliens fell back in a solid line 
except for the first curious-looking 
one. Quade got there ahead of us 
and made a grab. The creature rose 
into the air with a screaming vibration of his tail and landed on top 
of him, flattening him instantly. 
“Sssh, men,” Nagurski said. 
“Leave it to me. I’ll surround him.” 
The men followed the First Officer’s example, and the rope tying 
them to him. I went along cheerfully myself, until an enormous 
rump struck me violently in the 
face. My leaded boots were driven 
down into fertile soil, and my helmet was ringing like a bell. I got 
a jerky picture of the beast jumping up and down on top of the 
others joyously. Only the stiff space 
armor was holding up our slack 
frames. 
“Let’s let him escape,” Hoffman 
suggested on the audio circuit. 
“I’d like to,” Nagurski admitted, 
“but the other beasts won’t let us 
get past their circle.” 
THE SPICY SOUND OF SUCCESS 
It was true. The aliens formed a 
ring around us, and each time a 
bouncing boy hit the line, he only 
bounced back on top of us. 
“Flat!” I yelled. “Our seams can’t 
take much more of this beating.” 
I followed my own advice and 
landed in the dirt beside Quade. 
The bouncer came to rest and regarded us silently, head on an 
eighty-degree angle. 
I was stone sober. 
The others were lying around 
me quietly, passed out, knocked 
out, or taking cover. 
The ring of aliens drew in about 
us, closer, tighter, as the bouncer 
sat on his haunches and waited for 
us to move. 
EELING better?” I asked 
•*- Quade in the infirmary. 
He punched up his pillow and 
settled back. “I guess so. But when 
I think of all the ways I nearly got 
myself killed out there . How 
far have you got in the tractors?” 
“I’m having the tractors tom 
down and the parts put back into 
the spaceship where they belong. 
We shouldn’t risk losing them and 
getting stuck here.” 
“Are you settling for a primary 
exploration?” 
“No. I think I had the right idea 
on your rescue party. You have to 
meet and fight a planet on its own 
terms. Fighting confused sounds 
and tastes with music and wine was 
crude, but it was on the right track. 
Out there, we understood language 
because we were familiar with alien 
languages changed to other sense 
mediums by cybernetic translators. 
Using the translator, we can learn 
to recognize all confused data as 
easily. I’m starting indoctrination 
courses.” 
“I doubt that that is necessary, 
sir,” Quade said. “Experienced 
spacemen are experienced with 
transphasia. You don’t have to worry. In the future, I’ll be able to resist sensations that tell me I’m 
freezing to death — if my gauges 
tell me it’s a lie.” 
I examined his bandisprayed 
hide. “I think my way of gaining 
experience is less painful and more 
efficient.” 
Quade squirmed. “Yes, sir. One 
thing, sir — I don’t understand how 
you got me away from those aliens.” 
“The aliens were trying to help. 
They knew something was wrong 
and they were prodding and probing. When the first tractor pulled 
up and the men got out, they 
seemed to realize our own people 
could help us easier than they 
could.” 
“I am not quite convinced that 
those babies just meant to help us 
all the time.” 
“But they did! First, that call of 
theirs — it wasn’t to lead us into 
danger, but to warn us of the cliff, 
the freezing wind. They saw we 
were trying to find out things about 
their world, so they even offered us 
one of their own kind to study. Unfortunately, he was too much for 
us. They didn’t give us their top 
man, of course, only the village 
idiot. It’s just as well. We aren’t allowed to dissect creatures that far 
up the intelligence scale.” 
“But why should they want to 
help us?” Quade demanded suspiciously. 
“I think it’s like Nagurski’s dog. 
The dog came to him when it 
wanted somebody to own it, protect 
it, feed it, love it. These aliens want 
Earthmen to colonize the planet 
We came here, you see, same as the 
dog came to Nagurski.” 
“Well, I’ve learned one thing 
from all of this,” Quade said. “I’ve 
been a blind, arrogant, cocksure 
fool, following courses that were 
good on some worlds, most worlds, 
but not good on all worlds. I’m 
never going to be that foolhardy 
again.” 
“But you’re losing confidence, 
Quade! You aren’t sure of yourself 
any more. Isn’t confidence a space
man’s most valuable asset?” 
“The hell it is,” Quade said grimly. “It’s his deadliest liability.” 
“In that case, I must inform you 
that I am demoting you to Acting 
Executive Officer.” 
“Huh?” Quade gawked. “But 
dammit, Captain, you can’t do that 
to me! I’ll lose hazard pay and be 
that much further from retirement!” 
“That’s tough,” I sympathized, 
“but in every service a chap gets 
broken in rank now and then.” 
“Maybe it’s worth it,” Quade said 
heavily. “Now maybe I’ve learned 
how to stay alive out here. I just 
hope I don’t forget.” 
I thought about that. I was nearly through with my first mission 
and I could speak with experience, 
even if it was the least amount of 
experience aboard. 
“Quade,” I said, “space isn’t as 
dangerous as all that.” I clapped 
him on the shoulder fraternally. 
“You worry too much!”

Mugwump four 
By ROBERT SILVERBERG 
Illustrated By: MARTIN 
A L Miller was only trying to 
phone the Friendly Finance Corporation to ask 
about an extension on his loan. It 
was a Murray Hill number, and he 
had dialed as far as MU-4 when the 
receiver clicked queerly and a 
voice said, “Come in, Operator 
Nine. Operator„Nine, do you read 
me?” 
A1 frowned. “I didn’t want the 
operator. There must be something 
wrong with my phone if—” 
“Just a minute. Who are you?” 
“I ought to ask you that,” A1 said. 
“What are you doing on the other 
end, anyway? I hadn’t even finished dialing. I got as far as MU-4 
and—” 
“Well? You dialed MUgwump 
4 and you got us. What more do 
you want?” A suspicious pause. 
“Say, you aren’t Operator Nine!” 
“No, I’m not Operator Nine, and 
Fm trying to dial a Murray Hill 
number, and how about getting off 
the line?” 
“Hold it, friend. Are you a Normal?” 
A1 blinked. “Yeah— yeah, I like 
to think so.” 
“So how’d you know the number?” 
“Dammit, I didn’t know the number! I was trying to call someone, 
and all of a sudden the phone cut 
out and I got you, whoever the 
blazes you are.” 
“I’m the communications warden at MUgwump 4,” the other 
said crisply. “And you’re a suspicious individual. We’ll have to investigate you.” 
The telephone emitted a sudden 
burping sound. A1 felt as if his feet 
had grown roots. He could not 
move at all. It was awkward to be 
standing there at his own telephone 
in the privacy of his own room, as 
unbending as a steel girder. Time 
still moved, he saw. The hand on 
the big clock above the phone had 
just shifted from 3:30 to 3:31. 
Sweat rivered down his back as 
he struggled to put down the phone. 
He fought to lift his left foot. He 
strained to twitch his right eyelid. 
No go on all counts; he was frozen, 
all but his chest muscles — thank 
goodness for that. 
CEVERAL minutes later, matters became even more awkward when his front door, which 
had been locked, opened abruptly. 
Three strangers entered. They 
looked oddly alike: a trio of 
Tweedledums, no more than five 
feet high, wide through the waist, 
jowly of face and balding of head, 
each wearing an inadequate singlebreasted blue serge suit. 
A1 discovered he could roll his 
eyes. He rolled them. He wanted 
to apologize because his unexpected paralysis kept him from acting the proper part of a host, but 
his tongue would not obey. And on 
second thought, it occurred to him 
that the little bald men might be 
connected in some way with that 
paralysis. 
The reddest-faced of the three 
little men hung up the telephone 
and the stasis ended. A1 nearly 
folded up as the tension that 
gripped him broke. He said, “Just 
who the deuce—” 
“We will ask the questions. You 
are A1 Miller?” 
A1 nodded. 
“And obviously you are a Normal. So there has been a grave 
error. Mordecai, examine the telephone.” 
The second little man picked up 
the phone and calmly disemboweled it with three involved motions 
of his stubby hands. He frowned 
over the telephone’s innards for a 
moment; then, humming tuneless
ly, he produced a wire-clipper and 
severed the telephone cord. 
“Hold on here!” A1 burst out. 
“You can’t just rip out my phone 
like that! You aren’t from the 
phone company!” 
“Quiet,” said the spokesman 
nastily. “Well, Mordecai?” 
The second little man said, 
“Probability 1 to 1,000,000. The 
cranch interval overlapped and his 
telephone matrix slipped. His call 
was piped into our wire by error, 
Waldemar.” 
“So he isn’t a spy?” Waldemar 
asked. 
“Doubtful. As you see, he’s of 
rudimentary intelligence. His dialing our number was a statistical 
fluke.” 
“But now he knows about us,” 
said the third little man in a surprisingly deep voice. “I vote for demolecularization.” 
The other two whirled on their 
companion. “Always bloodthirsty, 
eh, Giovanni?” said Mordecai. 
“You’d violate the code at the snap 
of a meson.” 
“There won’t be any demolecularization while Vm in charge,” 
added Waldemar. 
“What do we do with him then?” 
Giovanni demanded. 
Mordecai said, “Freeze him and 
take him down to Headquarters. 
He’s their problem.” 
“I think this has gone about as 
far as it’s going to go,” A1 exploded 
at last. “However you three creeps 
got in here, you’d better get yourselves right out again, or—” 
“Enough,” Waldemar said. 
A1 felt his jaws stiffen. He 
realized bewilderedly that he was 
frozen again. And frozen, this time, 
with his mouth gaping foolishly 
open. 
' I ' HE trip took about five minutes, and so far as A1 was concerned, it was one long blur. At the 
end of the journey, the blur lifted 
for an instant, long enough to give 
A1 one good glimpse of his surroundings — a residential street in 
what might have been Brooklyn or 
Queens (or Cincinnati or Detroit, 
he thought morbidly) — before he 
was hustled into the basement of a 
two-family house. He found himself in a windowless, brightly lit 
chamber cluttered with complexlooking machinery and with a 
dozen or so alarmingly identical 
little bald-headed men. Not until 
then did his paralysis lift. 
The chubbiest of the bunch 
glared sourly at him and asked, 
“Are you a spy?” 
“I’m just an innocent bystander,” 
A1 said earnestly. “I picked up my 
phone and started to dial, and all 
of a sudden some guy asked me if 
I was Operator Nine. Honest, that’s 
all.” 
“Overlapping of the cranch 
interval,” muttered Mordecai. 
“Slipped matrix.” 
“Umm. Unfortunate,” the chub
by one commented. “We’ll have to 
dispose of him.” 
“Demolecularization is the best 
way,” Giovanni put in immediately
“Dispose of him humanely, I 
mean. It’s revolting to think of taking the life of an inferior being. But 
he simply can’t remain in this fourspace any longer, not if he knows.” 
“But I don’t know!” A1 protested. 
“I couldn’t be any more mixed up 
if I tried! Won’t you please tell 
me—” 
“Very well,” said the pudgiest 
one, who seemed to be the leader. 
“Waldemar, tell him about us.” 
Waldemar said, “You’re now in 
the local headquarters of a secret 
mutant group working for the overthrow of humanity as you know 
it. By some accident, you happened 
to dial our private communication 
exchange, MUtant 4—” 
“I thought it was MUgwump 4,” 
A1 interjected. 
“The code name, naturally,” said 
Waldemar. “To continue: you 
channeled into our communication 
network. You now know too much. 
Your presence in this space-time 
nexus jeopardizes the success of 
our entire movement. Therefore we 
are forced—” 
“—to demolecularize— ” Giovanni began. 
“—to dispose of you,” Waldemar 
continued sternly. “We’re humane 
beings — most of us — and we won’t 
do anything that would make you 
suffer. But you can’t stay in this 
area of space-time, can you?” 
A1 shook his head dimly. These 
little potbellied men were mutants 
working for the overthrow of humanity? Well, he had no reason to 
think they were lying to him. The 
world was full of little potbellied 
men. Maybe they were all part of 
the secret organization. 
“Look,” he said, “I didn’t want 
to dial your number. It was all a 
silly accident. But I’m a fair guy. 
Let me get out of here and I’ll keep 
mum about the whole thing. You 
can go ahead and overthrow humanity, if that’s what you want to 
do. I promise not to interfere in any 
way. If you’re mutants, you ought 
to be able to look into my mind 
and see that I’m sincere—” 
“We have no telepathic powers,” 
declared the chubby leader curtly. 
“If we had, there would be no need 
for a communications network in 
the first place. In the second place, 
your sincerity is not the issue. We 
have enemies. If you were to fall 
into their hands—” 
“I won’t say a word! Even if they 
torture me — brainwash me — I 
swear I’ll keep quiet!” 
“No. At this stage in our campaign, we can take no risks. You’ll 
have to go. Prepare the temporal 
centrifuge, Mordecai.” 
OUR of the little men, led by 
•*- Mordecai, unveiled a complicated-looking device of the general 
size and shape of a concrete mixer. 
Waldemar and Giovanni shoved A1 
toward the machine. It came rapidly to life: dials glowed, indicator 
needles teetered, loud buzzes and 
clicks implied readiness. 
A1 said nervously, “What are you 
going to do to me?” 
“This machine will hurl you forward in time,” Waldemar explained. “Too bad we have to rip 
you right out of your temporal 
matrix, but we’ve no choice. You’ll 
be well taken care of up ahead, 
though. No doubt, by the 25th century, our kind will have taken over 
completely. You’ll be the last of 
the Normals. Practically a living 
fossil. You’ll love it. You’ll be a 
walking museum piece.” 
“Assuming the machine works,” 
Giovanni put in maliciously. “We 
don’t really know if it does, you 
see.” 
A1 gaped. They were busily 
strapping him to a cold copper slab 
in the heart of the machine. “You 
don’t even know if it works?” 
“Not really,” Waldemar admitted. “Present theory holds that 
time-travel works only one way — 
forward. So we haven’t been able 
to recover any of our test specimens and see how they reacted. Of 
course, they do vanish when the 
machine is turned on, so we know 
they must go somewhere.” 
“Oh,” A1 said weakly. 
He was trussed in thoroughly. 
Experimental wriggling of his right 
wrist showed him that. But even if 
he could get loose, these weird little 
men would only freeze him and 
put him into the machine again. 
His shoulders slumped resignedly. He wondered if anyone would 
miss him. The Friendly Finance 
Corporation certainly would. But 
since, in a sense, it was their fault 
he was in this mess now, he couldn’t 
get very upset about that. They 
could always sue his estate for the 
$300 he owed them, if his estate 
was worth that much. 
Nobody else was going to mind 
the disappearance of Albert Miller from the space-time continuum, 
he thought dourly. His parents 
were dead, he hadn’t seen his one 
sister in fifteen years, and the girl 
he used to know in Topeka was 
married and at last report had three 
kids. 
S TILL and all, he liked 1959. 
He wasn’t sure how he would 
take to the 25 th century — or the 
25 th century to him. 
“Ready for temporal discharge,” 
Mordecai sang out. 
The chubby leader peered up at 
Al. “We’re sorry about all this, you 
understand. But nothing and nobody can be allowed to stand in the 
way of the Cause.” 
“Sure,” Al said. “I understand.” 
The concrete-mixer part of the 
machine began to revolve, bearing 
Al with it as it built up tempokinetic potential. Momentum in
creased alarmingly. In the background, A1 heard an ominous droning sound that grew louder and 
louder, until it drowned out everything else. His head reeled. The 
room and its fat little mutants went 
blurry. He heard a pop! like the 
sound of a breaking balloon. 
It was the rupturing of the spacetime continuum. A1 Miller went 
hurtling forward along the fourspace track, head first. He shut his 
eyes and hoped for the best. 
¥¥7" HEN the dizziness stopped, 
™ he found himself sitting in the 
middle of an impeccably clean, 
faintly yielding roadway, staring up 
at the wheels of vehicles swishing 
by overhead at phenomenal speeds. 
After a moment or two more, he 
realized they were not airborne, but 
simply automobiles racing along an 
elevated roadway made of some 
practically invisible substance. 
So the temporal centrifuge had 
worked! 
A1 glanced around. A crowd was 
collecting. A couple of hundred 
people had formed a big circle. 
They were pointing and muttering. 
Nobody approached closer than fifty or sixty feet. 
They weren’t potbellied mutants. Without exception, they were 
all straight-backed six-footers with 
full heads of hair. The women were 
tall, too. Men and women alike 
were dressed in a sort of tuniclike 
garment made of iridescent material that constantly changed
colors. 
A gong began to ring, rapidly 
peaking in volume. A1 scrambled to 
his feet and put on a tentative 
smile. 
“My name’s Miller. I come from 
1959. Would somebody mind telling me what year this is, and—” 
He was drowned out by two hundred voices screaming in terror. 
The crowd stampeded away, dashing madly in every direction, as if 
he were some ferocious monster. 
The gong continued to clang loudly. Cars hummed overhead. 
A1 saw a squat, beetle-shaped 
black vehicle coming toward him 
on the otherwise empty road. The 
car pulled up half a block away, 
the top sprang open, and a figure 
clad in what might have been a 
driver’s suit — or a spacesuit — 
stepped out and advanced toward 
Al. 
“Dozzinon murrifar volan,” the 
armored figure called out. 
“No speak,” Al replied. “I’m a 
stranger here.” 
To his dismay, he saw the other 
draw something shaped like a 
weapon and point it at him. Al’s 
hands shot immediately into the 
air. A globe of bluish light exuded 
from the broad nozzle of' the gun, 
hung suspended for a moment, and 
drifted toward Al. He dodged uneasily to one side, but the globe of 
light followed him, descended, and 
wrapped itself around him.
It was like being on the inside 
of a soap-bubble. He could see out, 
though distortedly. He touched the 
curving side of the globe in a cautious way; it was resilient and 
springy to the touch, but his finger did not go through. 
He noticed with some misgiving 
that his bubble-cage was starting to 
drift off the ground. It trailed a 
ropelike extension, which the man 
in the armored suit deftly grabbed 
and knotted to the rear bumper 
of his car. He drove quickly away 
— with Al, bobbing in his impenetrable bubble of light, tagging helplessly along like a captured Gaul 
being dragged through the streets 
of Rome behind a chariot — but 
several feet in the air. 
He got used to the irregular motion after a while and relaxed 
enough to be able to study his surroundings. He was passing through 
a remarkably antiseptic-looking 
city, free from refuse and dust 
Towering buildings, all bright and 
spankingly new-looking, shot up 
everywhere. People goggled at him 
from the safety of the pedestrian 
walkways as he jounced past 
A FTER about ten minutes, the 
car halted outside an imposing building whose facade bore the 
words ISTFAQ BARNOLL. Three 
men in armored suits appeared 
from within to flank Al’s captor as 
a kind of honor guard. Al was borne 
within. 
He was nudged gently into a 
small room on the ground floor. 
The door rolled shut behind him 
and seemed to join the rest of the 
wall; no division-line was apparent. 
A moment later, the balloon 
popped open, and just in time, too; 
the air had been getting quite stale 
inside it. 
Al glanced around. A square window opened in the wall and three 
grim-faced men peered intently at 
him from an adjoining cubicle. 
A voice from a speaker grid 
above Al’s head said, “Murrifar 
althrosk?” 
“Al Miller, from the 20th century. And it wasn’t my idea to come 
here, believe me.” 
“Durberal haznik? Quittimar?” 
Al shrugged. “No parley-voo. 
Honest, I don’t savvy.” 
His three interrogators conferred 
among themselves — taking what 
seemed to Al the needless precaution of switching off the mike to 
prevent him from overhearing their 
deliberations. 
He saw one of the men leave the 
observation cubicle. When the man 
returned, some five minutes later, 
he brought with him a tall, gloomylooking man wearing an impressive 
spade-shaped beard. 
The mike was turned on again. 
Spadebeard said rumblingly, “How 
be thou hight?” 
“Eh?” 
“An thou reck the King’s tongue, 
I conjure thee speak!” 
A1 grinned. No doubt they had 
fetched an expert in dead languages 
to talk to him. “Right language, but 
the wrong time. I’m from the 20th 
century, not the tenth. Come forward a ways.” 
Spadebeard paused to change 
mental gears. “A thousand pardons 
— I mean sorry. Wrong idiom. Dig 
me now?” 
“I follow you. What year is this?” 
“It is 2431. And from whence be 
you?” 
“You don’t quite have it straight 
yet, but I’m from 1959.” 
“And how came you hither?” 
“I wish I knew,” A1 said. “I was 
just trying to phone the loan company, see? Anyway, I got involved 
with these little fat guys who 
wanted to take over the world. Mutants, they said they were. And 
they decided they had to get rid 
of me, so they bundled me into their 
time machine and shot me forward. 
So I’m here.” 
“A spy of the mutated ones, eh?” 
“Spy? Who said anything about 
a spy? Talk about jumping to conclusions! I’m—” 
“You have been sent by them to 
wreak mischief among us. No transparent story of yours will deceive 
us. You are not the first to come to 
our era, you know. And you will 
meet the same fate the others met.” 
A L shook his head foggily. “Look 
here, you’re making a big mistake. I’m not a spy for anybody. 
And I don’t want to get involved 
in any war between you and the 
mutants—” 
“The war is over. The last of the 
mutated ones was exterminated 50 
years ago.” 
“Okay, then. What can you fear 
from me? Honest, I don’t want to 
cause any trouble. If the mutants 
are wiped out, how could my spying help them?” 
“No action in time and space is 
ever absolute. In our fourspace, the 
mutants are eradicated — but they 
lurk elsewhere, waiting for their 
chance to enter and spread destruction.” 
Al’s brain was swimming. “Let’s 
let that pass. I’m not a spy. I just 
want to be left alone. Let me settle 
down here somewhere — put me on 
probation, show me the ropes, stake 
me to a few credits, or whatever 
you use for money here. I won’t 
make any trouble.” 
“Your body teems with microorganisms of diseases long extinct in this world. Only the fact 
that we were able to confine you 
in a force-bubble almost as soon as 
you arrived here saved us from a 
terrible epidemic of ancient diseases.” 
“A couple of injections, that’s all, 
and you can kill any bacteria on 
or in me,” A1 pleaded. “You’re advanced people. You ought to be 
able to do a simple thing like that.” 
“And then there is the matter of 
your genetic structure,” Spade
beard continued inexorably. “You 
bear genes long since eliminated 
from humanity as undesirable. Permitting you to remain here, breeding furtively, would introduce unutterable confusion. Perhaps you 
carry latently the same mutant 
strain that cost humanity so many 
centuries of bloodshed!” 
“No,” A1 protested. “Look at me. 
I’m pretty tall, no potbelly, a full 
head of hair—” 
“The gene is recessive. But it 
crops up unexpectedly.” 
“I solemnly promise to control 
my breeding,” A1 declared. “I won’t 
run around scattering my genes all 
over your shiny new world. That’s 
a promise.” 
“Your appeal is rejected,” came 
the inflexible reply. 
A1 shrugged. He knew when he 
was beaten. “Okay,” he said wearily. “I didn’t want to live in your 
damn century anyway. When’s the 
execution?” 
“Execution?” Spadebeard looked 
stunned. “Dove’s whiskers, do you 
think we would— would actually—” 
He couldn’t get the word out. 
A1 supplied it: “Put me to 
death?” 
Spadebeard’s expression was 
sickly. He looked ready to retch. A1 
heard him mutter vehemently to 
his companions in the observation 
cubicle: “Gonnim deflarrimog! Egfar!” 
“Murrifar althrosk,” suggested 
one of his companions. 
Spadebeard, evidently reassured, 
nodded. He said to Al, “No doubt a 
barbarian like yourself would expect to be — to be made dead.” 
Gulping, he went gamely on. “We 
have no such vindictive intention.” 
“Well, what are you going to do 
to me?” 
“Send you across the timeline to 
a world where your friends, the mutated ones, reign supreme,” Spadebeard replied. “If s the least we can 
do for you, spy.” 
T HE hidden door of his cell 
puckered open. Another armorsuited figure entered, pointing a 
gun, and discharged a blob of blue 
light that drifted toward Al and 
rapidly englobed him. He was 
drawn by the trailing end out into 
a corridor. 
It hadn’t been a very sociable 
reception here in the 25th century, 
he thought as he was tugged along 
the hallway. In a way, he couldn’t 
blame them. A time-traveler from 
the past was bound to be laden 
down with all sorts of germs. They 
couldn’t risk letting him run 
around breathing at everybody. No 
wonder that crowd of onlookers 
had panicked when he had opened 
his mouth to speak to them. 
The other business, though, that 
of his being a spy for the mutants— 
he couldn’t figure that out at all. If 
the mutants had been wiped out 
fifty years ago, why worry about 
spies now? At least his species had 
managed to defeat the underground organization of potbellied 
little men. That was comforting. He 
wished he could get back to 1959, 
if only to snap his fingers in their 
jowly faces and tell them that all 
their sinister scheming was going to 
come to nothing. 
Where was he heading now? 
Spadebeard had said, Across the 
timeline to a world where the mutated ones reign supreme. Whatever across the timeline meant, A1 
thought 
He was ushered into an impressive laboratory room and, bubble 
and all, was thrust into the waiting 
clasps of something that looked depressingly like an electric chair. 
Brisk technicians bustled around, 
throwing switches and checking 
connections. 
A1 glanced in appeal at Spadebeard. “Will you tell me what’s going on?” 
“It is very difficult to express in 
medieval terms,” the linguist said. 
“The device makes use of dollibar 
force to transmit you through an 
inverse dormin vector — do I make 
myself clear?” 
“Not very,” A1 confessed. 
“Unhelpable. But you understand the concept of parallel continua at least, of course.” 
“No.” 
“Does it mean anything to you 
if I say that you’ll be shunted 
across the spokes of the time-wheel 
to a totality that is simultaneously 
parallel and tangent to our fourspace?” 
“That isn’t much better,” A1 said 
resignedly, for all he was really getting was a headache. “You might as 
well start shunting me, I suppose.” 
Spadebeard nodded and turned 
to a technician. “Vorstrar althrosk,” 
he commanded. 
“Murrifar.” 
The technician grabbed an immense toggle switch with both 
hands and groaningly dragged it 
shut. A1 heard a brief whine of closing relays. Then darkness surrounded him. 
ONCE again he found himself on
a city street. But the pavement 
was cracked and buckled, and 
grassblades poked up through the 
neglected concrete. 
A dry voice said, “All right, you. 
Don’t sprawl there like a ninny. Get 
up and come along.” 
A1 peered doubtfully up into the 
snout of a fair-sized pistol of enormous caliber. It was held by a short, 
fat, bald-headed man. Four identical companions stood near him 
with arms folded. They all looked 
very much like Mordecai, Waldemar, Giovanni, and the rest, except that these mutants were 
decked out in futuristic-looking costumes bright with flashy gold trim 
and rocketship insignia. 
A1 put up his hands. “Where am 
I?” he asked in confusion. 
“Earth, of course. You’ve just 
come through a dimensional gateway from the continuum of the 
Normals. Come along, spy. Into the 
van.” 
“But I’m not a spy,” A1 mumbled 
without very much hope as the five 
little men bundled him into a blue 
and red car the size of a small 
yacht. “At least, I’m not spying on 
you. I mean—” 
“Save the explanations for the 
Overlord,” was the curt instruction. 
A1 huddled miserably cramped 
between two vigilant mutants, 
while the others sat behind him. 
The van moved seemingly of its 
own volition, and at an enormous 
rate. A mutant power, A1 thought. 
After a while he said, “Could you 
at least tell me what year this is?” 
“Yes — 2431,” snapped the mutant to his left. 
“But that’s the same year it was 
over there.” 
“Certainly. What else could it 
be?” 
The question floored Al. He was 
silent for perhaps half a mile more. 
Since the van had no windows, he 
stared morosely at his feet. 
Finally he asked, “How come 
you aren’t afraid of catching my 
germs then? Over back of — ah — 
the dimensional gateway, they kept 
me cooped up in a force-field all 
the time so I wouldn’t contaminate 
them. But you go right ahead 
breathing the same air I do.” 
“Do you think we fear the germs 
of a Normal, spy?” sneered the mu
tant at Al’s right. “You forget that 
we’re a superior race.” 
Al nodded. “Yes. I forgot about 
that.” 
The van halted suddenly and 
the mutant police hustled Al out, 
past a crowd of peering little fat 
men and women, and into a colossal dome of a building whose exterior was covered completely with 
faceted green glass. The effect was 
one of massive ugliness. 
They ushered him into a sort 
of throne room presided over by a 
mutant fatter than the rest. The 
policeman gripping Al’s right arm 
hissed, “Bow when you enter the 
presence of the Overlord.” 
Al wasn’t minded to argue. He 
dropped to his knees along with the 
others. A booming voice from 
above rang out. “What have you 
brought me today?” 
“A spy, Your Nobility.” 
“Another? Rise, spy.” 
Al rose. “Begging Your Nobility’s pardon, I'd like to put in a word 
or two on my own behalf—” 
“Silence!” the Overlord roared. 
Al closed his mouth. 
The mutant drew himself up to 
his full height, about five feet one, 
and said, “The Normals have sent 
you across the dimensional gulf to 
spy on us.” 
“No, Your Nobility. They were 
afraid I’d spy on them, so they sent 
me over here. I’m from the year 
1959, you see.” Briefly, he explained everything, beginning with
the bollixed phone call and ending 
with his capture by the Overlord’s 
men a short while ago. 
The Overlord looked skeptical. 
“It is well known that the Normals 
plan to cross the dimensional gulf 
from their phantom world to this, 
the real one, and invade our civilization. You’re but the latest of 
their advance scouts. Admit it!” 
“No, Your Nobility, I’m not On 
the other side, they told me I was 
a spy from 1959, and now you say 
I’m a spy from the other dimension. But I tell you—” 
“Enough!” the mutant leader 
thundered. “Take him away. Place 
him in custody. We shall decide 
his fate later!” 
SOMEONE else already occu^ pied the cell into which A1 was 
thrust. He was a lanky, sad-faced 
Normal who slouched forward to 
shake hands once the door had 
clanged shut. 
“Thurizad manifosk,” he said. 
“Sorry, I don’t speak that language,” said Al. 
The other grinned. “I understand. All right: greetings. I’m Darren Phelp. Are you a spy too?” 
“No, dammit!” Al snapped. 
Then : “Sorry. Didn’t mean to take 
it out on you. My name’s Al Miller. 
Are you a native of this place?” 
“Me? Dove’s whiskers, what a 
sense of humor! Of course I’m not 
a native! You know as well as I do 
that there aren’t any Normals left 
in this fourspace continuum.” 
“None at all?” 
“Hasn’t been one born here in 
centuries,” Phelp said. “But you’re 
just joking, eh? You’re from Baileffod’s outfit, I suppose.” 
“Who?” 
“Baileffod. Bailefiod! You mean 
you aren’t? Then you must be from 
higher up!” Phelp thrust his hands 
sideways in some kind of gesture of 
respect “Penguin’s paws, Excellency, I apologize. I should have 
seen at once—” 
“No, I’m not from your organization at all,” Al said. “I don’t know 
what y ou’re talking about. Word 
of honor.” 
Phelp smiled cunningly. “Of 
course, Excellency! I understand 
completely.” 
“Cut that out! Why doesn’t anyone ever believe me? I’m not from 
Baileffod and I’m not from higher 
up. I come from 1959. Do you hear 
me — 1959? And that’s the truth.” 
Phelp’s eyes went wide. “From 
the past?” 
Al nodded. “I stumbled into the 
mutants in 1959 and they shipped 
me five centuries ahead to get rid 
of me. Only when I arrived, I wasn’t 
welcome, so I was shipped across 
the dimensional what is to here.
Everyone thinks I’m a spy, wherever I go. What are you doing 
here?” 
Phelp smiled. ‘Why, I am a spy.” 
“From 2431?” 
“Naturally. We have to keep
tabs on the mutants somehow. I 
came through the gateway wearing 
an invisibility shield, but it popped 
an ultrone and I vizzed out. They 
jugged me last month and I suppose I’m stuck in this place for 
keeps.” 
A L rubbed thumbs tiredly against 
his eyeballs. “Wait a minutehow come you speak my language? 
On the other side, they had to get 
hold of a linguistics expert to talk 
to me.” 
“All spies are trained to talk 
English,” said Phelp. “That’s the 
language the mutants speak here. 
In the real world, we speak Vorkish, naturally. It’s the language developed by Normals for communication during the Mutant Wars. 
Your ‘linguistics expert’ was probably one of our top spies.” 
“And over here the mutants have 
won?” 
“Completely. Three hundred 
years ago, in this continuum, the 
mutants developed a two-way time 
machine that enabled them to go 
back and forth, eliminating Normal 
leaders before they were born. 
Whereas in our world, the real 
world, two-way time travel is impossible. That’s where the continuum split begins. We Normals 
fought a grim war of extermination 
against the mutants in our fourspace and finally wiped them out, 
despite their superior powers, in 
2390. Clear?” 
“More or less.” Rather less than 
more, A1 added privately. “So there 
are only mutants in this world, and 
there are only Normals in your 
world.” 
“Exactly!” 
“And you’re a spy from the other 
side.” 
“You’ve got it now! You see, 
even though, strictly speaking, this 
world is only a phantom, it’s got 
some pretty real characteristics. 
For instance, if the mutants killed 
you here, you’d be dead. Permanently. So there’s a lot of rivalry 
across the gateway; the mutants are 
always scheming to invade us, and 
vice versa. Confidentially, I don’t 
think anything will ever come of all 
the scheming.” 
“You don’t?” 
“Nah,” Phelp said. “The way 
things stand now, each side has a 
perfectly good enemy just beyond 
reach. But actually going to war 
would be messy, while relaxing our 
guard and allowing peace to break 
out would foul up our economy. So 
we keep sending spies back and 
forth, and prepare for war. It’s a 
nice system, except when you happen to get yourself caught, like 
me.” 
“What’ll happen to you?” 
Phelp shrugged. “They may let 
me rot here for a few decades. Or 
they might decide to condition me 
and send me back as a spy for 
them. Tiger tails, who could 
know?”
“Would you change sides like 
that?” 
“I wouldn’t have any choice — 
not after I was conditioned,” Phelp 
said. “But I don’t worry much about 
it. It’s a risk I knew about when I 
signed on for spy duty.” 
A1 shuddered. It was beyond him 
how someone could voluntarily let 
himself get involved in this game 
of dimension-shifting and mutantbattling. But it takes all sorts to 
make a continuum, he philosophically decided. 
IXALF an hour later, three rotund mutant police came to 
fetch him. They marched him 
downstairs and into a bare, ugly 
little room where a battery of interrogators quizzed him for better 
than an hour. He stuck to his story, 
throughout everything, until at last 
they indicated they were through 
with him. 
He spent the next two hours in 
a drafty cell, by himself, until finally a gaudily robed mutant unlocked the door and said, “The 
Overlord commands you to present 
yourself.” 
The Overlord looked worried. 
He leaned forward on his throne, 
fist digging into his fleshy chin. In 
his booming voice — A1 realized at 
last that it was artificially amplified — the Overlord rumbled, “Miller, you’re a problem.” 
“I’m sorry, Your Nobil— ” 
"Quiet! I’ll do the talking.” 
A1 did not reply. 
The Overlord went on, ‘We’ve 
checked your story inside and out, 
and confirmed it with one of our 
spies on the other side of the gate. 
You really are from 1959, or thereabouts. What can we do with you? 
Generally speaking, when we catch 
a Normal snooping around here, we 
psycho-condition him and send him 
back across the gateway to spy for 
us. But we can’t do that to you, because you don’t belong on the other 
side, and they’ve already tossed you 
out once. On the other hand, we 
can’t keep you here, maintaining 
you forever at state expense. And it 
wouldn’t be civilized to kill you, 
would it?” 
“No, Your Nobil-” 
“Silence!” 
A1 gulped. 
The Overlord glowered at him 
and continued thinking out loud. 
“I suppose we could perform experiments on you, though. You 
must be a walking laboratory of 
Normal microorganisms that we 
could synthesize and fire through 
the gateway when we invade their 
fourspace. Yes, by the Grome, then 
you’d be useful to our cause! Zechariah?” 
“Yes, Nobility?” A ribbon-bedecked guardsman snapped to attention. 
“Take this Normal to the biological laboratories for examination. I’ll have further instructions as 
soon as—” 
A1 heard a peculiar whanging 
noise from the back of the throne 
room. The Overlord appeared to 
freeze on his throne. Turning, A1 
saw a band of determined-looking 
Normals come bursting in, led by 
Darren Phelp. 
“There you are!” Phelp cried. 
“I’ve been looking all over for you!” 
He was waving a peculiar needlenozzled gun. 
“What’s going on?” A1 gasped. 
Phelp grinned. “The invasion! It 
came, after all! Our troops are pouring through the gateway armed 
with these freezer guns. They immobilize any mutant who gets in 
the way of the field.” 
“When — when did all this happen?” 
“It started two hours ago. We’ve 
captured the entire city! Come on, 
will you? Whiskers, there’s no time 
to waste!” 
“Where in blazes am I supposed 
to go?” 
Phelp smiled. “To the nearest dimensional lab, of course. We’re going to send you back to your own 
time.” 
A DOZEN triumphant Normals 
stood in a tense knot around 
A1 in the laboratory. From outside 
came the sound of jubilant singing. 
The invasion was a howling success. 
As Phelp had explained it, the 
victory was due to the recent invention of a kind of time-barrier 
projector. The projector had cut 
off all contact between the mutant 
world and its own future, preventing time-traveling mutant scouts 
from getting back to 2431 with 
news of the invasion. With two-way 
travel, the great mutant advantage, 
thus nullified, the success of the surprise attack was made possible — 
and easy. 
A1 listened to this explanation 
with minimal interest. He barely 
understood every third word, and, 
in any event, his main concern was 
in getting home. 
He was strapped into a streamlined and much modified version of 
the temporal centrifuge that had 
originally hurled him forward into 
2431. 
Phelps explained things to him. 
“You see here, we set the machine 
for 1959. What day was it when 
you left? And how close can you 
get to the moment?” 
“Ah — October 10. It was exactly 3:30 in the afternoon.” 
“Make the setting, Frozz.” Phelp 
nodded. “You’ll be shunted back 
along the time-line. Of course, 
you’ll land in this continuum, since 
in our world there’s no such thing 
as pastward time travel. But once 
you reach your own time, all you 
do is activate this small transdimensional generator, and you’ll be 
hurled across safe and sound into 
the very day you left, in your own 
fourspace.” 
“You can’t know how much I appreciate all this,” A1 said very
warmly. 
He felt a pleasant glow of love 
for all mankind, for the first time 
since his unhappy phone call. At 
last someone was taking sympathetic interest in his plight. At last 
he was on his way home, back to 
the relative sanity of 1959, where 
he could start forgetting this entire 
nightmarish jaunt. Mutants and 
Normals and spies and time machines . 
“You'd better get going,” Phelp 
said. “We have to get the occupation under way here.” 
“Sure,” A1 agreed. “Don’t let me 
hold you up. I can’t wait to get going — no offense intended.” 
“And remember, soon as your 
surroundings look familiar, jab the 
activator button on this generator. 
Otherwise you’ll slither into an interspace where we couldn’t answer 
for the consequences.” 
A1 nodded tensely. “I won’t forget.” 
“I hope not. Ready?” 
“Ready.” 
Someone threw a switch. A1 began to spin. He heard the popping 
sound that was the rupturing of 
the temporal matrix. Like a cork 
shot from a champagne bottle, A1 
arched out backward through time, 
heading for 1959. 
TT E woke in his own room on 
23rd Street. His head hurt. 
His mind was full of phrases like 
temporal centrifuge and transdimensional generator. 
He picked himself off the floor 
and rubbed his head. 
Wow, he thought. It must have 
been a sudden fainting spell. And 
now his head was crowded with 
nonsense. 
Going to the sideboard, he pulled 
out the half-empty bourbon bottle 
and measured off a few fingers’ 
worth. 
After the drink, his nerves 
felt steadier. His mind was still cluttered with inexplicable thoughts 
and images. Sinister little fat men 
and complex machines, transparent 
roadways in the air and men in fancy tunics. 
A bad dream, he thought. 
Then he remembered. It wasn’t 
any dream. He had actually taken 
the round trip into 2431, returning by way of some other continuum. 
He had pressed the generator 
button at the proper time, and now 
here he was, safe and sound. No 
longer the football of a bunch of different factions. Home in his own 
snug little fourspace, or whatever 
it was. 
He frowned. He recalled that 
Mordecai had severed the telephone wire. But the phone looked 
intact now. Maybe it had been fixed 
while he was gone. He picked it up. 
Unless he got that loan extension 
today, he was cooked. 
There was no need for him to 
look up the number of the Friendly Finance Corporation; he knew 
it all too well. He began to dial. 
MUrray Hill 4
The receiver clicked queerly. A 
voice said, “Come in, Operator 
Nine. Operator Nine, do you read 
me?” 
Al’s jaw sagged. This is where I 
came in, he thought wildly. He 
struggled to put down the phone. 
But his muscles would not respond. 
It would be easier to bend the sun 
in its orbit than to break the path 
of the continuum. He heard his 
own voice say, “I didn’t want the 
operator. There must be something 
wrong with my phone if—” 
“Just a minute. Who are you?” 
A1 fought to break the contact. 
But he was hemmed away in a 
small corner of his mind while his 
voice went on, “I ought to ask you 
that. What are you doing on the 
other end, anyway? I hadn’t even 
finished dialing. I got as far as 
MU-4 and 
“Well? You dialed MUgwump 
4 and you got us. What more do 
you want?” A suspicious pause. 
“Say, you aren’t Operator Nine!” 
Inwardly, A1 wanted to scream. 
No scream would come. In this continuum, the past (his future) was 
immutable. He was caught on the 
track, and there was no escape. 
None whatever. And, he realized 
in frozen horror, there never would

Ignorance of the law can so be 
a valid excuse — and the result 
is this hilarious but legal . 
LICENSE 
By LOUIS NEWMAN 
THE history of man becomes
fearfully and wonderfully 
confusing with the advent 
of interstellar travel. Of special interest to the legally inclined student is the famous Skrrgck Affair, 
which began before the Galactic 
Tribunal with the case of Citizens 
vs. Skrrgck. 
The case, and the opinion of the 
Court, may be summarized as follows: 
Skrrgck, a native of Sknnbt (Altair IV), where theft is honorable, 
sanctioned by law and custom, im
lllustrated by WOOD 
migrated to Earth (Sol III) where 
theft is contrary to both law and 
custom. 
While residing in Chicago, a city 
in a political subdivision known as 
the State of Illinois, part of the 
United States of America, one of 
the ancient nation-states of Earth, 
he overheard his landlady use the 
phrase “A license to steal,” a common colloquialism in the area, 
which refers to any special privilege. 
Skrrgck then went to a police 
station in Chicago and requested a 
license to steal. The desk sergeant, 
as a joke, wrote out a document 
purporting to be a license to steal, 
and Skrrgck, relying on said document, committed theft, was apprehended, tried and convicted. On direct appeal allowed to the Galactic 
Tribunal, the Court held: 
( 1 ) All persons are required to 
know and obey the law of the jurisdiction in which they reside. 
(2) Public officials must refrain from misrepresenting to 
strangers the law of the jurisdiction. 
(3) Where, as here, a public official is guilty of such misrepresentation, the requirement of knowledge no longer applies. 
(4) Where, as here, it is shown 
by uncontradicted evidence that 
a defendant is law-abiding and willing to comply with the standards of 
his place of residence, misrepresentation of law by public officials may 
amount to entrapment. 
(5) The Doctrine of Entrapment bars the State of Illinois from 
prosecuting this defendant. 
( 6 ) The magnitude of the crime 
is unimportant compared with the 
principle involved, and the fact that 
the defendant’s unusual training on 
Sknnbt enabled him to steal a large 
building in Chicago, known as the 
Merchandise Mart, is of no significance. 
(7) The defendant, however, 
was civilly liable for the return of 
the building, and its occupants, or 
their value, even if he had to steal 
to get it, provided, however, that 
he stole only on and from a planet 
where theft was legal. 
TP HE Skrrgck case was by no 
•*- means concluded by the decision of the Galactic Tribunal, but 
continued to reverberate down the 
years, a field day for lawyers, and 
“a lesson to all in the complexities 
of modern intergalactic law and society,” said Winston, Harold C., 
Herman Prof, of Legal History, 
Harvard. 
Though freed on the criminal 
charge of theft, Skrrgck still faced 
some 20,000 charges of kidnapping, 
plus the civil liability imposed upon 
him by the ruling of the Court. 
The kidnapping charges were 
temporarily held in abeyance. Not 
that the abductions were not considered outrageous, but it was 
quickly realized by all concerned 
that if Skrrgck were constantly involved in lengthy and expensive 
defenses to- criminal prosecutions, 
there would be no chance at all of 
obtaining any restitution from him. 
First things first, and with Terrans 
that rarely means justice. 
Skrrgck offered to pay over the 
money he had received for the 
building and its occupants, but that 
was unacceptable to the Terrans, 
for what they really wanted, with 
that exaggerated fervor typical of 
them, provided it agrees with their 
financial interests, was the return 
LICENSE TO STEAL 
of the original articles. Not only 
were the people wanted back, but 
the building itself had a special significance. 
Its full title was “The New Merchandise Mart” and it had been 
built in the exact style of the original and on the exact spot on the 
south side of the Chicago River 
where the original had stood prior 
to its destruction in the Sack of 
Chicago. It was more than just a 
large commercial structure to the 
Terrans. It was also a symbol of 
Terra’s unusually quick recovery 
from its Empire Chaos into its present position of leadership within 
the Galactic Union. The Terrans 
wanted that building back. 
So Skrrgck, an obliging fellow at 
heart, tried first to get it back, but 
this proved impossible, for he had 
sold the building to the Aldebaranian Confederacy for use in its annual “prosperity fiesta.” 
The dominant culture of the Aldebaranian system is a descendant 
of the “conspicuous destruction” or 
“potlatch” type, in which articles of 
value are destroyed to prove the 
wealth and power of the destroyers. 
It was customary once every Aldebaranian year — about six Terran — for the Aldebaranian government to sponsor a token celebration 
of this destructive sort, and it had 
purchased the Merchandise Mart 
from Skrrgck as part of its special 
celebration marking the first thousand years of the Confederacy. 
Consequently, the building, along 
with everything else, was totally 
destroyed in the “bonfire” that consumed the entire fourth planet from 
the main Aldebaranian sun. 
Nor was Skrrgck able to arrange 
the return to Terra of the occupants 
of the building, some 20,000 in 
number, because he had sold them 
as slaves to the Bootean League. 
T T is commonly thought slavery 
•*- is forbidden throughout the 
Galaxy by the terms of Article 19 
of the Galactic Compact, but such 
is not the case. What is actually 
forbidden is “involuntary servitude” and this situation proved the 
significance of that distinction. In 
the case of Sol v. Bootes, the Galactic Tribunal held that Terra had no 
right to force the “slaves” to give up 
their slavery and return to Terra 
if they did not wish to. And, quite 
naturally, none of them wished to. 
It will be remembered that the 
Booteans, a singularly handsome 
and good-natured people, were in 
imminent danger of racial extinction due to the disastrous effects of 
a strange nucleonic storm which 
had passed through their system in 
1622. The physiological details of 
the “Bootean Effect,” as it has been 
called, was to render every Bootean 
sterile in relation to every other 
Bootean, while leaving each Bootean normally capable of reproduction, provided one of the partners 
in the union had not been sub
jected to the nucleonic storm. 
Faced with this situation, the 
Booteans immediately took steps 
to encourage widespread immigration by other humanoid races, chiefly Terrans, for it was Terrans who 
had originally colonized Bootes 
and it was therefore known that 
interbreeding was possible. 
But the Booteans were largely 
unsuccessful in their immigration 
policy. Terra was peaceful and 
prosperous, and the Booteans, being poor advertisers, were unable 
to convince more than a handful to 
leave the relative comforts of home 
for the far-off Bootean system 
where, almost all were sure, some 
horrible fate lay behind the Booteans’ honeyed words. So when 
Skrrgck showed up with some 
20,000 Terrans, the Booteans, in 
desperation, agreed to purchase 
them in the hope of avoiding the 
“involuntary servitude” prohibition 
of Article 19 by making them like 
it 
In this, they were spectacularly 
successful. The “slaves” were 
treated to the utmost luxury and 
every effort was made to satisfy 
any reasonable wish. Their “duties” 
consisted entirely of “keeping company” with the singularly attractive 
Booteans. 
Under these circumstances it is, 
perhaps, hardly surprising that out 
of the 20,101 occupants, all but 
332 flatly refused to return to 
Terra. 
The 332 who did wish to return, 
most of whom were borderline psychotics, were shipped home, and 
Bootes sued Skrrgck for their purchase price, but was turned down 
by the Galactic Quadrant Court on 
the theory of, basically, Caveat 
Emptor — let the buyer beware. 
’ 1 1 HE Court in Sol v. Bootes had 
held that although adults could 
not be required to return to Terra, 
minors under the age of 31 could 
be, and an additional 569 were returned under this ruling, to the vociferous disgust of the post-puberty 
members of that group. Since 
there was apparently some question of certain misrepresentations 
by Skrrgck as to the ages or family 
affiliations of some members of 
this minor group, he agreed to an 
out-of-court settlement of Bootes’ 
claim for their purchase price, thus 
depriving the legal profession of 
further clarification of the rights of 
two “good faith” dealers in this 
peculiar sort of transaction. 
The Terran people, of course, 
were totally unsatisfied with this 
result. Led by some demagogues 
and, to a milder degree, by most of 
the political opposition to the existing Terran government, and reminded of certain actual examples 
from Terra’s own history, many became convinced that some form of 
nefarious “brainwashing” had been 
exercised upon the “unfortunate” 
Terran expatriates. Excitement ran 
LICENSE TO STEAL 
high, and there was even some agitation for withdrawal from the Galactic Union. 
Confronted with such unrest, the 
Terran government made efforts to 
reach some settlement with Bootes 
despite the decision of the Court 
in Sol v. Bootes, and was finally 
able to gain in the Centaurian 
Agreement a substantial reparation, it being specifically stipulated 
in the Agreement that the money 
was to be paid to the dependents 
who suffered actual financial loss. 
In a suit against the Terran government by one of the excluded 
families, to obtain for that family a 
share of the reparation, the validity 
of the treaty, as it applied to exclude the suing family and others in 
like position, was upheld by the 
United States Supreme Court. 
The suit was begun before the 
Agreement had been ratified by the 
General Assembly, and the Court 
indicated that the plaintiff would 
have lost on the strength of a long 
line of cases giving the World President certain inherent powers over 
the conduct of foreign affairs. Since, 
however, the matter came up for 
decision after ratification, the Court 
said that the “inherent powers” 
question was moot, and that the 
Agreement, having been elevated 
to the status of a treaty by ratification, must be held valid under 
the “Supremacy of Treaties” section of Article 102 of the United 
Terran Charter. 
Although this failed to satisfy the 
Terran people — and their anger 
may have contributed to the fall 
of the Solarian Party administration in the following election — the 
Treaty is generally considered by 
students of the subject as a triumph 
of Solarian diplomacy, and an outstanding example of intergalactic 
good faith on the part of Bootes. 
/~kF course, neither the demagogy 
nor the anger could hide forever the true facts about how the 
Booteans were treating their 
“slaves,” and when the true facts 
became known, there was a sudden 
flood of migration from Terra to 
Bootes, which threatened to depopulate the Solarian Empire and 
drown Bootes. The flood was quickly dammed by the Treaty of Deneb 
restricting migration between the 
two systems. This treaty was held 
to be a valid police-powers exception to the “Free Migration” principle of Article 17 of the Galactic 
Compact in Boleslaw v. Sol and 
Bootes. 
All this left Skrrgck with liabilities of some forty million credits 
and practically no assets. Like most 
Altairians, he was a superb thief 
but a poor trader. The price he had 
received for the Merchandise Mart 
and the “slaves,” while amounting 
to a tidy personal fortune, was less 
than half the amount of the claims 
against him, and due to an unfortunate predilection for slow Aedrils 
and fast Flowezies, he only had 
about half of that left. 
Skrrgck, who had by this time 
apparently developed a love of litigation equal to his love of thievery, 
used part of what he did have left 
in a last effort to evade liability by 
going into bankruptcy, a move 
which was naturally met with howls 
of outrage by his creditors and a 
flood of objections to his petition, 
a flood which very nearly drowned 
the Federal District Court in Chicago. 
It would be difficult to imagine a 
more complex legal battle than 
might have taken place, nor one 
more instructive to the legal profession, had the situation been carried 
to its logical conclusion. 
On the one hand was the age-old 
policy of both Terran and Galactic 
bankruptcy law. A man becomes 
unable to pay his debts. He goes into bankruptcy. Whatever he does 
have is distributed to his creditors, 
who must be satisfied with what 
they can get out of his present assets. They cannot require him to 
go to work to earn additional funds 
with which to pay them more. It is 
precisely to escape this form of 
mortgage on one’s future that bankruptcy exists. 
Yet here were over seven 
thousand creditors claiming that 
Skrrgck’s debts should not be discharged in bankruptcy, because 
Skrrgck could be required to steal 
enough to satisfy them fully. 
Could the creditors require 
Skrrgck to exert such personal efforts to satisfy their claims? A lawyer would almost certainly say 
“no,” citing the Bankruptcy Act as 
sufficient grounds alone, not to mention the anomaly of having Terrans, in a Terran court, ask that 
Skrrgck, for their benefit, commit 
an act illegal on Terra and punishable by that Terran court. 
The idea of a Terran court giving judicial sanction to theft is 
novel, to say the least. Indeed, 
Judge Griffin, who was presiding, 
was overheard to remark to a friend 
on the gulfe course that he “would 
throw the whole d— n thing out” for 
that reason alone. 
Y ET, in spite of this undeniable 
weight of opinion, it is difficult 
to say just what the final decision 
would have been had the matter 
been carried to the Galactic Tribunal, for in the original case of 
Skrrgck v. Illinois, that august 
body, it will be remembered, had 
specifically stated that Skrrgck was 
liable for the value of the building 
and its occupants, “even if he must 
steal to obtain it.” 
Now that hasty and ill-advised 
phrase was certainly dicta, and was 
probably intended only as a joke, 
the opinion having been written by 
Master Adjudicator Stsssts, a member of that irrepressible race of 
saurian humorists, the Sirians. But 
if the case had actually come before 
LICENSE TO STEAL 
Fig. 1: Actual scene of license issue (Skrrgck superimposed) 
them, the Court might have been 
hoist on its own petard, so to speak, 
and been forced to rule in accord 
with its earlier “joke.” 
Unfortunately for the curiosity 
of the legal profession, the question 
was never to be answered, for 
Skrrgck did a remarkable thing 
which made the whole controversy 
irrelevant. What his motives were 
will probably never be known. His 
character makes it unlikely that he 
began the bankruptcy proceedings 
in good faith and was later moved 
by conscience. It is possible that the 
bankruptcy was merely an elaborate piece of misdirection. More 
probably, however, he simply 
seized on the unusual opportunity 
the publicity gave him. 
Whatever the motives, the facts 
are that Skrrgck used the last of 
his waning resources to purchase 
one of the newly developed Terran 
Motors’ “Timebirds” in which he 
traveled secretly to Altair. Even 
Fig. 2: The moment of decision, case of Citizens vs. Skrrgck 
this first model of the Timebird, 
with its primitive meson exchange 
discoordinator, cut the trip from 
Sol to Altair from weeks to days, 
and Skrrgck, landing secretly on his 
home planet while his bankruptcy 
action was still in the turmoil stage, 
was able to accomplish the greatest 
“coup” in Altarian history. He 
never could have done it without 
the publicity of the legal proceedings. In a culture where theft is 
honorable, the most stringent pre
cautions are taken against its accomplishment, but who could have 
expected Skrrgck? He was lightyears away, trying to go into bankruptcy. 
And so, while all eyes on Altair, 
as well as throughout the rest of the 
Galaxy, were amusedly fixed on the 
legal circus shaping up on Terra, 
Skrrgck was able to steal the Altairian Crown Jewels, and the Altairian Crown Prince as well, and 
flee with them to Sol. 
LICENSE TO STEAL 
' I ' HE reaction was violent. The 
Galaxy was gripped by an 
almost hysterical amusement 
Skrrgck’s creditors on Terra were 
overjoyed. The Altairians made 
one effort to regain their valuables 
in the courts, but were promptly 
turned down by the Galactic Tribunal which held, wisely, that a 
society which made a virtue of theft 
would have to take the consequences of its own culture. 
So Skrrgck’s creditors were paid 
in full. The jewels alone were more 
than sufficient for that, containing 
as they did no less than seven priceless “Wanderstones,” those strange 
bits of frozen fire found ever so 
rarely floating in the interstellar 
voids, utterly impervious to any of 
the effects of gravitation. Altair 
paid a fantastic price for the return 
of the collection, and Skrrgck also 
demanded, and got, a sizable ransom for the Prince, after threatening to sell him to Bootes, from 
whence, of course, he would never 
return. Being a prince in a democratic, constitutional monarchy is 
not as glamorous as you might 
think. 
His creditors satisfied, Skrrgck 
returned to Sknnbt, dragging with 
him an angry Crown Prince— angry 
at having lost the chance to go to 
Bootes, that is. At Altair, Skrrgck 
was received as a popular hero. He 
had accomplished something of 
which every Altairian had dreamed, 
almost from the moment of his 
birth, and he was widely and joyously acclaimed. Riding on this 
wave of popular adulation, he entered politics, ran for the office of 
Premier, and was elected by an 
overwhelming majority. 
As soon as he took office, he took 
steps, in accordance with Altairian 
custom, to wipe out the “stain” on 
his honor incurred by allowing the 
Chicago police sergeant to fool him 
with the now famous License to 
Steal. 
He instituted suit against the 
sergeant for the expenses of his defense to the original theft charge. 
The case was carried all the way 
to the Galactic Tribunal, which by 
this time was heartily sick of the 
whole mess. Feeling apparently 
that the sergeant was the original 
cause of said mess, the Court overruled his plea that he had merely 
been joking. 
The Court cited an ancient case 
from West Virginia, U.S.A. — Plate 
v. Durst, 42 W. Va. 63, 24 SE 580, 
32 L.R.A. 404. (Note: The date of 
this case is invariably given as 
1896, which is most confusing, since 
the present date is only 1691. The 
1896, however, refers to the eighteen hundred and ninety-sixth year 
of the pre-atomic era, which we, of 
course, style A.A. — Ante Atomica. 
Since the present era begins with 
the first atomic explosion, the case 
actually occurred in approximately the year 54 A.A.) 
The Court quoted the opinion in 
this ancient case as follows: “Jokes 
are sometimes taken seriously by 
. the inexperienced . and if such 
is the case, and the person thereby 
deceived is led to (incur expenses) 
in the full belief and expectation 
that the joker is in earnest, the law 
will also take the joker at his word, 
and give him good reason to smile.” 
A CCORDINGLY, the sergeant 
was charged with a very large 
judgment. Although the City of 
Chicago paid this judgment, the 
sergeant had become the laughingstock of the planet, so he applied 
for, and was granted, a hardship 
exception to the Treaty of Deneb 
and migrated to Bootes. 
There, regarded as the real savior of the Bootean race, and a 
chosen instrument of the God of 
Bootes, he was received as a saint. 
He died in 1689, surrounded by his 
22 children and 47 grandchildren, 
having made himself wealthy by 
becoming the leader of a most excessive fertility cult, which is only 
now being forcibly suppressed by 
the Bootean Government. 
In 1635 P.A., someone on Earth 
remembered the kidnapping indictments still outstanding against 
Skrrgck and attempted to prosecute them. By this time, however, 
Skrrgck was Premier, the chief 
executive officer of Altair, and all 
extradition matters were within his 
sole discretion. In the exercise of 
this power, he refused to extradite 
himself, and the prosecutor on 
Earth, whose constituents were beginning to laugh at him, had the indictments quashed “in the interest 
of interstellar harmony.” 
The story has an interesting sequel. During Skrrgck’s unprecedented six consecutive terms as 
Premier (no one else had ever 
served less than seven), he was 
able, by dint of unremitting political maneuvering, to have theft outlawed in the Altairian system. It 
was, he said, “a cultural trait that 
is more trouble than it is worth.”

By W. T. HAGGERT 
Nothing in the world could be 
happier and more serene 
than a man who loves his work 
— but what happens when it 
loves him back? 
K EEP your nerve, Peter 
Manners told himself; it’s 
only a job. But nerve has 
to rest on a sturdier foundation 
than cash reserves just above zero 
and eviction if he came away from 
this interview still unemployed. 
Clay, at the Association of Professional Engineers, who had set up 
the appointment, hadn’t eased 
Peter’s nervousness by admitting, 
w<< 
Ju* • 
“I don’t know what in hell he’s looking for. He’s turned down every 
man we’ve sent him.” 
The interview was at three. Fifteen minutes to go. Coming early 
would betray overeagerness. Peter 
stood in front of the Lex Industries 
plant and studied it to kill time. 
Plain, featureless concrete walls, 
not large for a manufacturing plant 
— it took a scant minute to exhaust 
its sightseeing potential. If he 
walked around the building, he 
could, if he ambled, come back to 
the front entrance just before three. 
He turned the corner, stopped, 
frowned, wondering what there was 
about the building that seemed so 
puzzling. It could not have been 
plainer, more ordinary. It was in 
fact, he only gradually realized, so 
plain and ordinary that it was like 
no other building he had ever seen. 
There had been windows at the 
front. There were none at the side, 
and none at the rear. Then how 
were the working areas lit? He 
looked for the electric service lines 
and found them at one of the rear 
corners. They jolted him. The distribution transformers were ten 
times as large as they should have 
been for a plant this size. 
Something else was wrong. 
Peter looked for minutes before he 
found out what it was. Factories 
usually have large side doorways 
for employees changing shifts. This 
building had one small office entrance facing the street, and the 
only other door was at the loading 
bay — big enough to handle employee traffic, but four feet above 
the ground. Without any stairs, it 
could be used only by trucks backing up to it. Maybe the employees’ 
entrance was on the third side. 
It wasn’t. 
S TARING back at the last blank 
wall, Peter suddenly remembered the time he had set out to 
kill. He looked at his watch and 
gasped. At a run, set to straight-arm 
the door, he almost fell on his face. 
The door had opened by itself. He 
stopped and looked for a photoelectric eye, but a soft voice said 
through a loudspeaker in the anteroom wall: “Mr. Manners?” 
“What?” he panted. “Who-?” 
“You are Mr. Manners?” the 
voice asked. 
He nodded, then realized he had 
to answer aloud if there was a 
microphone around; but the soft 
voice said : “Follow the open doors 
down the hall. Mr. Lexington is expecting you.” 
“Thanks,” Peter said, and a door 
at one side of the anteroom swung 
open for him. 
He went through it with his composure slipping still further from his 
grip. This was no way to go into an 
interview, but doors kept opening 
before and shutting after him, until 
only one was left, and the last of his 
calm was blasted away by a bellow 
from within. 
“Don’t stand out there like a 
jackass! Either come in or go 
away!” 
Peter found himself leaping obediently toward the doorway. He 
stopped just short of it, took a deep 
breath and huffed it out, took another, all the while thinking, Hold 
on now; you’re in no shape for an 
interview — and ifs not your fault 
— this whole setup is geared to unnerve you: the kindergarten kid 
called in to see the principal. 
He let another bellow bounce off 
him as he blew out the second 
breath, straightened his jacket and 
tie, and walked in as an engineer 
applying for a position should. 
“Mr. Lexington?” he said. “I’m 
Peter Manners. The Association—” 
“Sit down,” said the man at the 
desk. “Let’s look you over.” 
He was a huge man behind an 
even huger desk. Peter took a chair 
in front of the desk and let himself be inspected. It wasn’t comfortable. He did some looking over 
of his own to ease the tension. 
The room was more than merely large, carpeted throughout with 
a high-pile, rich, sound-deadening 
rug. The oversized desk and massive leather chairs, heavy patterned 
drapes, ornately framed paintings— 
by God, even a glass-brick manteled fireplace and bowls with flowers! — made him feel as if he had 
walked down a hospital corridor 
into Hollywood’s idea of an office. 
His eyes eventually had to move 
to Lexington, and they were 
daunted for another instant. This 
was a citadel of a man — great girders of frame supporting buttresses 
of muscle — with a vaulting head 
and drawbridge chin and a steel 
gaze that defied any attempt to 
storm it. 
But then Peter came out of his 
momentary flinch, and there was an 
age to the man, about 65, and he 
saw the muscles had turned to fat, 
the complexion ashen, the eyes set 
deep as though retreating from 
pain, and this was a citadel of a 
man, yes, but beginning to crumble. 
“What can you do?” asked Lexington abruptly. 
"D ETER started, opened his 
mouth to answer, closed it 
again. He’d been jolted too often in 
too short a time to be stampeded 
into blurting a reply that would cost 
him this job. 
“Good,” said Lexington. “Only a 
fool would try to answer that. Do 
you have any knowledge of medicine?” 
“Not enough to matter,” Peter 
said, stung by the compliment 
“I don’t mean how to bandage a 
cut or splint a broken arm. I mean 
things like cell structure, neural 
communication — the basics of how 
we live.” 
“I’m applying for a job as engineer.” 
“I know. Are you interested in 
the basics of how we live?” 
LEX 
Peter looked for a hidden trap, 
found none. “Of course. Isn’t everyone?” 
“Less than you think,” Lexington said. “It’s the preconceived notions they’re interested in protecting. At least I won’t have to beat 
them out of you.” 
“Thanks,” said Peter, and waited 
for the next fast ball. 
“How long have you been out of 
school?” 
“Only two years. But you knew 
that from the Association—” 
“No practical experience to 
speak of?” 
“Some,” said Peter, stung again, 
this time not by a compliment. 
“After I got my degree, I went East 
for a post-graduate training program with an electrical manufacturer. I got quite a bit of experience 
there. The company—” 
“Stockpiled you,” Lexington 
said. 
Peter blinked. “Sir?” 
“Stockpiled you! How much did 
they pay you?” 
“Not very much, but we were 
getting the training instead of 
wages.” 
“Did that come out of the pamphlets they gave you?” 
“Did what come out—” 
“That guff about receiving training instead of wages!” said Lexington. “Any company that really 
wants bright trainees will compete 
for them with money — cold, hard 
cash, not platitudes. Maybe you 
saw a few of their products being 
made, maybe you didn’t. But you’re 
a lot weaker in calculus than when 
you left school, and in a dozen other 
subjects too, aren’t you?” 
“Well, nothing we did on the 
course involved higher mathematics,” Peter admitted cautiously, “and I suppose I could use a 
refresher course in calculus.” 
“Just as I said — they stockpiled 
you, instead of using you as an engineer. They hired you at a cut 
wage and taught you things that 
would be useful only in their own 
company, while in the meantime 
you were getting weaker in the subjects you’d paid to learn. Or are 
you one of these birds that had the 
shot paid for him?” 
“I worked my way through,” said 
Peter stiffly. 
“If you’d stayed with them five 
years, do you think you’d be able 
to get a job with someone else?” 
Peter considered his answer carefully. Every man the Association 
had sent had been turned away. 
That meant bluffs didn’t work 
Neither, he’d seen for himself, did 
allowing himself to be intimidated. 
“I hadn’t thought about it,” he 
said. “I suppose it wouldn’t have 
been easy.” 
“Impossible, you mean. You 
wouldn’t know a single thing except their procedures, their catalogue numbers, their way of doing 
things. And you’d have forgotten so 
much of your engineering training, 
you’d be scared to take on an engineer’s job, for fear you’d be asked 
to do something you’d forgotten 
how to do. At that point, they could 
take you out of the stockpile, put 
you in just about any job they 
wanted, at any wage you’d stand 
for, and they’d have an indentured 
worker with a degree — but not the 
price tag. You see that now?” 
TT made Peter feel he had been 
suckered, but he had decided 
to play this straight all the way. He 
nodded. 
“Why’d you leave?” Lexington 
pursued, unrelenting. 
“I finished the course and the increase they offered on a permanent 
basis wasn’t enough, so I went elsewhere—” 
“With your head full of this nonsense about a shortage of engineers.” 
Peter swallowed. “I thought it 
would be easier to get a job than it 
has been, yes.” 
“They start the talk about a 
shortage and then they keep it going. Why? So youngsters will take 
up engineering thinking they’ll 
wind up among a highly paid minority. You did, didn’t you?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“And so did all the others there 
with you, at school and in this stockpiling outfit?” 
“That’s right” 
“Well,” said Lexington unexpectedly, “there is a shortage! And the 
stockpilers are the ones who made 
it, and who keep it going! And the 
hell of it is that they can’t stop — 
when one does it, they all have to, 
or their costs get out of line and 
they can’t compete. What’s the 
solution?” 
“I don’t know,” Peter said. 
Lexington leaned back. “That’s 
quite a lot of admissions you’ve 
made. What makes you think 
you’re qualified for the job I’m offering?” 
“You said you wanted an engineer.” 
“And I’ve just proved you’re less 
of an engineer than when you left 
school. I have, haven’t I?” 
“All right, you have,” Peter said 
angrily. 
“And now you’re wondering why 
I don’t get somebody fresh out of 
school. Right?” 
Peter straightened up and met 
the old man’s challenging gaze. 
“That and whether you’re giving 
me a hard time just for the hell 
of it.” 
“Well, am I?” Lexington demanded. 
Looking at him squarely, seeing 
the intensity of the pain-drawn 
eyes, Peter had the startling feeling that Lexington was rooting for 
him! “No, you’re not.” 
“Then what am I after?” 
“Suppose you tell me.” 
So suddenly that it was almost 
like a collapse, the tension went 
out of the old man’s face and shoul
L EX 
ders. He nodded with inexpressible 
tiredness. “Good again. The mart 
I want doesn’t exist. He has to be 
made — the same as I was. You 
qualify, so far. You’ve lost your illusions, but haven’t had time yet to 
replace them with dogma or cynicism or bitterness. You saw immediately that fake humility or cockiness wouldn’t get you anywhere 
here, and you were right. Those 
were the important things. The 
background data I got from the Association on you counted, of course, 
but only if you were teachable. I 
think you are. Am I right?” 
“At least I can face knowing how 
much I don’t know,” said Peter, “if 
that answers the question.” 
“It does. Partly. What did you 
notice about this plant?” 
In precis form, Peter listed his 
observations: the absence of windows at sides and rear, the unusual 
amount of power, the automatic 
doors, the lack of employees’ entrances. 
“Very good,” said Lexington. 
“Most people only notice the automatic doors. Anything else?” 
“Yes,” Peter said. “You’re the 
only person I’ve seen in the buildmg. 
“I’m the only one there is.” 
Peter stared his disbelief. Automated plants were nothing new, but 
they all had their limitations. 
Either they dealt with exactly similar products or things that could be 
handled on a flow basis, like oil or 
water-soluble chemicals. Even 
these had no more to do than process the goods. 
“Come on,” said Lexington, getting massively to his feet “I’ll show 
you.” 
r 1 1 HE office door opened, and 
Peter found himself being led 
down the antiseptic corridor to another door which had opened, giving access to the manufacturing 
area. As they moved along, between 
rows of seemingly disorganized 
machinery, Peter noticed that the 
factory lights high overhead followed their progress, turning themselves on in advance of their coming, and going out after they had 
passed, keeping a pool of illumination only in the immediate area 
they occupied. Soon they reached 
a large door which Peter recognized as the inside of the truck 
loading door he had seen from outside. 
Lexington paused here. “This is 
the bay used by the trucks arriving with raw materials,” he said. 
“They back up to this door, and a 
set of automatic jacks outside lines 
up the trailer body with the door 
exactly. Then the door opens and 
the truck is unloaded by these materials handling machines.” 
Peter didn’t see him touch anything, but as he spoke, three glistening machines, apparently selfpowered, rolled noiselessly up to 
the door in formation and stopped 
there, apparently waiting to be inspected. 
They gave Peter the creeps. 
Simple square boxes, set on casters, with two arms each mounted 
on the sides might have looked 
similar. The arms, fashioned much 
like human arms, hung at the sides, 
not limply, but in a relaxed position that somehow indicated readiness. 
Lexington went over to one of 
them and patted it lovingly. “Really, these machines are only an extension of one large machine. The 
whole plant, as a matter of fact, is 
controlled from one point and is 
really a single unit. These materials 
handlers, or manipulators, were 
about the toughest things in the 
place to design. But they’re tremendously useful. You’ll see a lot 
of them around.” 
Lexington was about to leave the 
side of the machine when abruptly one of the arms rose to the handkerchief in his breast pocket and 
daintily tugged it into a more attractive position. It took only a 
split second, and before Lexington 
could react, all three machines were 
moving away to attend to mysterious duties of their own. 
Peter tore his eyes away from 
them in time to see the look of 
frustrated embarrassment that 
crossed Lexington’s face, only to 
be replaced by one of anger. He 
said nothing, however, and led 
Peter to a large bay where racks 
of steel plate, bar forms, nuts, bolts, 
and other materials were stored. 
“After unloading a truck, the machines check the shipment, report 
any shortages or overages, and store 
the materials here,” he said, the 
trace of anger not yet gone from his 
voice. “When an order is received, 
it’s translated into the catalogue 
numbers used internally within the 
plant, and machines like the ones 
you just saw withdraw the necessary materials from stock, make 
the component parts, assemble 
them, and package the finished 
goods for shipment Simultaneously, an order is sent to the billing 
section to bill the customer, and an 
order is sent to our trucker to come 
and pick the shipment up. Meanwhile, if the withdrawal of the materials required has depleted our 
stock, the purchasing section is instructed to order more raw materials. I’ll take you through the manufacturing and assembly sections 
right now, but they’re too noisy for 
me to explain what’s going on while 
we’re there.” 
ETER followed numbly as 
Lexington led him through a 
maze of machines, each one seemingly intent on cutting, bending, 
welding, grinding or carrying some 
bit of metal, or just standing idle, 
waiting for something to do. The 
two-armed manipulators Peter had 
just seen were everywhere, scuttling from machine to machine, ap
LEX 
parently with an exact knowledge 
of what they were doing and the 
most efficient way of doing it. 
He wondered what would happen if one of them tried to use the 
same aisle they were using. He pictured a futile attempt to escape the 
onrushing wheels, saw himself 
clambering out of the path of the 
speeding vehicle just in time to fall 
into the jaws of the punch press 
that was laboring beside him at the 
moment. Nervously, he looked for 
an exit, but his apprehension was 
unnecessary. The machines seemed 
to know where they were and 
avoided the two men, or stopped to 
wait for them to go by. 
Back in the office section of the 
building, Lexington indicated a 
small room where a typewriter 
could be heard clattering away. 
“Standard business machines, operated by the central control mechanism. In that room,” he said, as the 
door swung open and Peter saw 
that the typewriter was actually a 
sort of teletype, with no one before the keyboard, “incoming mail 
is sorted and inquiries are replied 
to. In this one over here, purchase 
orders are prepared, and across the 
hall there’s a very similar rig set up 
in conjunction with an automatic 
bookkeeper to keep track of the 
pennies and to bill the customers.” 
“Then all you do is read the incoming mail and maintain the machinery?” asked Peter, trying to 
shake off the feeling of open amaze
ment that had engulfed him. 
“I don’t even do those things, except for a few letters that come in 
every week that — it doesn’t want 
to deal with by itself.” 
The shock of what he had just 
seen was showing plainly on Peter’s 
face when they walked back into 
Lexington’s office and sat down. 
Lexington looked at him for quite 
a while without saying anything, 
his face sagging and pale. Peter 
didn’t trust himself to speak, and 
let the silence remain unbroken. 
Finally Lexington spoke. “I 
know it’s hard to believe, but there 
it is.” 
“Hard to believe?” said Peter. 
“I almost can’t. The trade journals 
run articles about factories like this 
one, but planned for ten, maybe 
twenty years in the future.” 
“Damn fools!” exclaimed Lexington, getting part of his breath 
back. “They could have had it years 
ago, if they’d been willing to drop 
their idiotic notions about specialization.” 
Lexington mopped his forehead 
with a large white handkerchief. 
Apparently the walk through the 
factory had tired him considerably, 
although it hadn’t been strenuous. 
TTE leaned back in his chair and 
began to talk in a low voice 
completely in contrast with the 
overbearing manner he had used 
upon Peter’s arrival. “You know 
what we make, of course.” 
“Yes, sir. Conduit fittings.” 
“And a lot of other electrical 
products, too. I started out in this 
business twenty years ago, using orthodox techniques. I never got 
through university. I took a couple 
of years of an arts course, and got so 
interested in biology that I didn’t 
study anything else. They bounced 
me out of the course, and I re-entered in engineering, determined 
not to make the same mistake 
again. But I did. I got too absorbed 
in those parts of the course that 
had to do with electrical theory and 
lost the rest as a result. The same 
thing happened when I tried commerce, with accounting, so I gave 
up and started working for one of 
my competitors. It wasn’t too long 
before I saw that the only way I 
could get ahead was to open up on 
my own.” 
Lexington sank deeper in his 
chair and stared at the ceiling as he 
spoke. “I put myself in hock to the 
eyeballs, which wasn’t easy, because I had just got married, and 
started off in a very small way. 
After three years, I had a fairly 
decent little business going, and I 
suppose it would have grown just 
like any other business, except for 
a strike that came along and put me 
right back where I started. My 
wife, whom I’m afraid I had neglected for the sake of the business, 
was killed in a car accident about 
then, and rightly or wrongly, that 
made me angrier with the union 
than anything else. If the union 
hadn’t made things so tough for me 
from the beginning, I’d have had 
more time to spend with my wife 
before her death. As things turned 
out — well, I remember looking 
down at her coffin and thinking that 
I hardly knew the girl. 
“For the next few years, I concentrated on getting rid of as many 
employees as I could, by replacing 
them with automatic machines. I’d 
design the control circuits myself, 
in many cases wire the things up 
myself, always concentrating on 
replacing men with machines. But 
it wasn’t very successful. I found 
that the more automatic I made my 
plant, the lower my costs went The 
lower my costs went, the more business I got, and the more I had to 
expand.” 
Lexington scowled. “I got sick 
of it. I decided to try developing 
one multi-purpose control circuit 
that would control everything, 
from ordering the raw materials to 
shipping the finished goods. As I 
told you, I had taken quite an interest in biology when I was in 
school, and from studies of nerve 
tissue in particular, plus my electrical knowledge, I had a few ideas 
on how to do it. It took me three 
years, but I began to see that I 
could develop circuitry that could 
remember, compare, detect similarities, and so on. Not the way they 
do it today, of course. To do what 
I wanted to do with these big 
LEX 
clumsy magnetic drums, tapes, and 
what-not, you’d need a building the 
size of Mount Everest. But I found 
that I could let organic chemistry 
do most of the work for me. 
“By creating the proper compounds, with their molecules arranged in predetermined matrixes, 
I found I could duplicate electrical 
circuitry in units so tiny that my 
biggest problem was getting into 
and out of the logic units with conventional wiring. I finally beat that 
the same way they solved the problem of translating a picture on a 
screen into electrical signals, developed equipment to scan the 
units cyclically, and once I’d done 
that, the battle was over. 
“I built this building and incorporated it as a separate company, 
to compete with my first outfit. In 
the beginning, I had it rigged up 
to do only the manual work that 
you saw being done a few minutes 
ago in the back of this place. I figured that the best thing for me to 
do would be to turn the job of selling my stuff over to jobbers, leaving me free to do nothing except 
receive orders, punch the catalogue 
numbers into the control console, 
do the billing, and collect the 
money.” 
“What happened to your original company?” Peter asked. 
j EXINGTON smiled. “Well, 
automated as it was, it 
couldn’t compete with this plant. 
It gave me great pleasure, three 
years after this one started working, to see my old company go belly up. This company bought the 
old firm’s equipment for next to 
nothing and I wound up with all 
my assets, but only one employee 
—me. 
“I thought everything would be 
rosy from that point on, but it 
wasn’t. I found that I couldn’t keep 
up with the mail unless I worked 
impossible hours. I added a couple 
of new pieces of equipment to the 
control section. One was simply a 
huge memory bank. The other was 
a comparator circuit. A complicated one, but a comparator circuit 
nevertheless. Here I was working 
on instinct more than anything. I 
figured that if I interconnected 
these circuits in such a way that 
they could sense everything that 
went on in the plant, and compare 
one action with another, by and by 
the unit would be able to see patterns. 
“Then, through the existing command output, I figured these new 
units would be able to control the 
plant, continuing the various patterns of activity that I’d already 
established.” 
Here Lexington frowned. “It 
didn’t work worth a damn! It just 
sat there and did nothing. I couldn’t 
understand it for the longest time, 
and then I realized what the 
trouble was. I put a kicker circuit 
into it, a sort of voltage-bias net
work. I reset the equipment so that 
while it was still under instructions 
to receive orders and produce 
goods, its prime purpose was to 
activate the kicker. The kicker, 
however, could only be activated 
by me, manually. Lastly, I set up 
one of the early TV pickups over 
the mail slitter and allowed every 
letter I received, every order, to 
be fed into the memory banks. 
That did it.” 
“I — I don’t understand,” stammered Peter. 
“Simple! Whenever I was pleased 
that things were going smoothly, I 
pressed the kicker button. The machine had one purpose, so far as 
its logic circuits were concerned. 
Its object was to get me to press 
that button. Every day I’d press it 
at the same time, unless things 
weren’t going well. If there had 
been trouble in the shop, I’d press 
it late, or maybe not at all. If all 
the orders were out on schedule, or 
ahead of time, I’d press it ahead of 
time, or maybe twice in the same 
day. Pretty soon the machine got 
the idea. 
“I’ll never forget the day I 
picked up an incoming order form 
from one of the western jobbers, 
and found that the keyboard was 
locked when I tried to punch it into 
the control console. It completely 
baffled me at first. Then, while I 
was tracing out the circuits to see 
if I could discover what was holding the keyboard lock in, I noticed 
that the order was already entered 
on the in-progress list. I was a long 
time convincing myself that it had 
really happened, but there was no 
other explanation. 
“The machine had realized that 
whenever one of those forms came 
in, I copied the list of goods from 
it onto the in-progress list through 
the console keyboard, thus activating the producing mechanisms in 
the back of the plant. The machine 
had done it for me this time, then 
locked the keyboard so I couldn’t 
enter the order twice. I think I held 
down the kicker button for a full 
five minutes that day.” 
“This kicker button,” Peter said 
tentatively, “it’s like the pleasure 
center in an animal’s brain, isn’t 
it?" 
YV7HEN Lexington beamed, 
” Peter felt a surge of relief. 
Talking with this man was like 
walking a tightrope. A word too 
much or a word too little might 
mean the difference between getting the job or losing it. 
“Exactly!” whispered Lexington, 
in an almost conspiratorial tone. “I 
had altered the circuitry of the machine so that it tried to give me 
pleasure — because by doing so, its 
own pleasure circuit would be activated. 
“Things went fast from then on. 
Once I realized that the machine 
was learning, I put TV monitors all 
over the place, so the machine 
LEX 
could watch everything that was 
going on. After a short while I had 
to increase the memory bank, and 
later I increased it again, but the 
rewards were worth it. Soon, by 
watching what I did, and then by 
doing it for me next time it had 
to be done, the machine had 
learned to do almost everything, 
and I had time to sit back and count 
my winnings.” 
At this point the door opened, 
and a small self-propelled cart 
wheeled silently into the room. 
Stopping in front of Peter, it waited 
until he had taken a small plate 
laden with two or three cakes off 
its surface. Then the soft, evenly 
modulated voice he had heard before asked, “How do you like your 
coffee? Cream, sugar, both or 
black?” 
Peter looked for the speaker in 
the side of the cart, saw nothing, 
and replied, feeling slightly silly as 
he did so, “Black, please.” 
A square hole appeared in the 
top of the cart, like the elevator 
hole in an aircraft carrier’s deck. 
When the section of the cart’s surface rose again, a fine china cup 
containing steaming black coffee 
rested on it. Peter took it and 
sipped it, as he supposed he was 
expected to do, while the cart proceeded over to Lexington’s desk. 
Once there, it stopped again, and 
another cup of coffee rose to its 
surface. 
Lexington took the coffee from 
the top of the car, obviously angry 
about something. Silently, he 
waited until the cart had left the 
office, then snapped, “Look at 
those bloody cups!” 
Peter looked at his, which was 
eggshell thin, fluted with carving 
and ornately covered with gold 
leaf. “They look very expensive,” 
he said. 
“Not only expensive, but stupid 
and impractical!” exploded Lexington. “They only hold half a cup, 
they’ll break at a touch, every one 
has to be matched with its own saucer, and if you use them for any 
length of time, the gold leaf comes 
off!” 
Peter searched for a comment, 
found none that fitted this odd outburst, so he kept silent. 
T EXINGTON stared at his cup 
without touching it for a long 
while. Then he continued with his 
narrative. “I suppose it’s all my 
own fault. I didn’t detect the symptoms soon enough. After this plant 
got working properly, I started living here. It wasn’t a question of saving money. I hated to waste two 
hours a day driving to and from 
my house, and I also wanted to be 
on hand in case anything should go 
wrong that the machine couldn’t 
fix for itself.” 
Handling the cup as if it were 
going to shatter at any moment, he 
took a gulp. “I began to see that the 
machine could understand the writ
LEX 
ten word, and I tried hooking a 
teletype directly into the logic circuits. It was like uncorking a 
seltzer bottle. The machine had a 
funny vocabulary — all of it gleaned 
from letters it had seen coming in, 
and replies it had seen leaving. But 
it was intelligible. It even displayed 
some traces of the personality the 
machine was acquiring. 
“It had chosen a name for itself, 
for instance — ‘Lex.’ That shook 
me. You might think Lex Industries was named through an abbreviation of the name Lexington, but 
it wasn’t. My wife’s name was 
Alexis, and it was named after the 
nickname she always used. I objected, of course, but how can you 
object on a point like that to a 
machine? Bear in mind that I had 
to be careful to behave reasonably 
at all times, because the machine 
was still learning from me, and I 
was afraid that any tantrums I 
threw might be imitated.” 
“It sounds pretty awkward,” 
Peter put in. 
“You don’t know the half of it! 
As time went on, I had less and less 
to do, and business-wise I found 
that the entire control of the operation was slipping from my grasp. 
Many times I discovered — too late 
— that the machine had taken the 
damnedest risks you ever saw on 
bids and contracts for supply. It 
was quoting impossible delivery 
times on some orders, and charging 
pirate’s prices on others, all without 
any obvious reason. Inexplicably, 
we always came out on top. It 
would turn out that on the shortdelivery-time quotations, we’d been 
up against stiff competition, and 
cutting the production time was the 
only way we could get the order. 
On the high-priced quotes, I’d find 
that no one else was bidding. We 
were making more money than I’d 
ever dreamed of, and to make it 
still better, I’d find that for months 
I had virtually nothing to do.” 
“It sounds wonderful, sir,” said 
Peter, feeling dazzled. 
“It was, in a way. I remember 
one day I was especially pleased 
with something, and I went to the 
control console to give the kicker 
button a long, hard push. The button, much to my amazement, had 
been removed, and a blank plate 
had been installed to cover the 
opening in the board. I went over to 
the teletype and punched in the 
shortest message I had ever sent. 
‘LEX — WHAT THE HELL?’ I typed. 
“The answer came back in the 
jargon it had learned from letters 
it had seen, and I remember it as 
if it just happened, ‘mr. a Lexington, LEX INDUSTRIES, DEAR SIR: 
RE YOUR LETTER OF THE THIRTEENTH INST., I AM PLEASED TO ADVISE YOU THAT I AM ABLE TO DISCERN WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE 
PLEASED WITH MY SERVICE WITHOUT THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT 
PREVIOUSLY USED FOR THIS PURPOSE. RESPECTFULLY, I MIGHT SUG
GALAXY 
GEST THAT IF THE PUSHBUTTON 
ARRANGEMENT WERE NECESSARY, 
I COULD PUSH THE BUTTON MYSELF. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS 
WOULD MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL, AND HAVE TAKEN STEPS 
TO RELIEVE YOU OF THE BURDEN 
INVOLVED IN REMEMBERING TO 
PUSH THE BUTTON EACH TIME 
YOU ARE ESPECIALLY PLEASED. I 
SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
INQUIRY, AND LOOK FORWARD TO 
SERVING YOU IN THE FUTURE AS I 
HAVE IN THE PAST. YOURS FAITHFULLY, LEX’.” 
D ETER burst out laughing, and 
■*- Lexington smiled wryly. “That 
was my reaction at first, too. But 
time began to weigh very heavily 
on my hands, and I was lonely, too. 
I began to wonder whether or not 
it would be possible to build a 
voice circuit into the unit. I increased the memory storage banks 
again, put audio pickups and loudspeakers all over the place, and began teaching Lex to talk. Each time 
a letter came in, I’d stop it under 
a video pickup and read it aloud. 
Nothing happened. 
“Then I got a dictionary and instructed one of the materials handlers to turn the pages, so that the 
machine got a look at every page. I 
read the pronunciation page aloud, 
so that Lex would be able to interpret the pronunciation marks, and 
hoped. Still nothing happened. One 
day I suddenly realized what the 
trouble was. I remember standing 
up in this very office, feeling silly 
as I did it, and saying, ‘Lex, please 
try to speak to me.’ I had never 
asked the machine to say anything, 
you see. I had only provided the 
mechanism whereby it was able to 
do so.” 
“Did it reply, sir?” 
Lexington nodded. “Gave me the 
shock of my life. The voice that 
came back was the one you heard 
over the telephone — a little awkward then, the syllables clumsy and 
poorly put together. But the voice 
was the same. I hadn’t built in any 
specific tone range, you see. All I 
did was equip the machine to 
record, in exacting detail, the frequencies and modulations it found 
in normal pronunciation as I used 
it. Then I provided a tone generator 
to span the entire audio range, 
which could be very rapidly controlled by the machine, both in volume and pitch, with auxiliaries to 
provide just about any combinations of harmonics that were 
needed. I later found that Lex had 
added to this without my knowing 
about it, but that doesn’t change 
things. I thought the only thing— it 
had heard was my voice, and I expected to hear my own noises imitated.” 
“Where did the machine get the 
voice?” asked Peter, still amazed 
that the voice he had heard on the 
telephone, in the reception hall, and 
LEX 
from the coffee cart had actually 
been the voice of the computer. 
“Damned foolishness!” snorted 
Lexington. “The machine saw what 
I was trying to do the moment I 
sketched it out and ordered the 
parts. Within a week, I found out 
later, it had pulled some odds and 
‘ends together and built itself a 
standard radio receiver. Then it 
listened in on every radio program 
that was going, and had most of the 
vocabulary tied in with the written 
word by the time I was ready to 
start. Out of all the voices it could 
have chosen, it picked the one 
you’ve already heard as the one 
likely to please me most” 
“It’s a very pleasant voice, sir.” 
“Sure, but do you know where it 
came from? Soap opera! It’s Lucy’s 
voice, from The Lite and Loves of 
Mary Butterworth!” 
T EXINGTON glared, and Peter 
wasn’t sure whether he should 
sympathize with him or congratulate him. After a moment, the anger 
wore off Lexington’s face, and he 
shifted in his chair, staring at his 
now empty cup. “That’s when I 
realized the thing was taking on 
characteristics that were more than 
I’d bargained for. It had learned 
that it was my provider and existed 
to serve me. But it had gone further 
and wanted to be all that it could 
be : provider, protector, companion 
— wife, if you like. Hence the gradual trend toward characteristics 
that were as distinctly female as a 
silk negligee. Worse still, it had 
learned that when I was pleased, I 
didn’t always admit it, and simply 
refused to believe that I would 
have it any other way.” 
“Couldn’t you have done something to the circuitry?” asked Peter. 
“I suppose I could,” said Lexington, “but in asking that, you don’t 
realize how far the thing had gone. 
I had long since passed the point 
when I could look upon her as a 
machine. Business was tremendous. 
I had no complaints on that score. 
And tinkering with her personality 
— well, it was like committing some 
kind of homicide. I might as well 
face it, I suppose. She acts like a 
woman and I think of her as one. 
“At first, when I recognized this 
trend for what it was, I tried to 
stop it. She’d ordered a subscription to Vogue magazine, of all 
things, in order to find out the latest 
in silverware, china, and so on. I 
called up the local distributor and 
canceled the subscription. I had no 
sooner hung up the telephone than 
her voice came over the speaker. 
Very softly, mind you. And her inflections by this time were superb. 
‘That was mean,’ she said. Three 
lousy words, and I found myself 
phoning the guy right back, saying 
I was sorry, and would he please 
not cancel. He must have thought 
I was nuts.” 
Peter smiled, and Lexington 
made as if to rise from his chair, 
thought the better of it, and shifted 
his bulk to one side. “Well, there 
it is,” he said softly. “We reached 
that stage eight years ago.” 
Peter was thunderstruck. “But — 
if this factory is twenty years ahead 
of the times now, it must have been 
almost thirty then!” 
Lexington nodded. “I figured fifty at the time, but things are moving faster nowadays. Lex hasn’t 
stood still, of course. She still reads 
all the trade journals, from cover 
to cover, and we keep up with the 
world. If something new comes up, 
we’re in on it, and fast. We’re going to be ahead of the pack for a 
long time to come.” 
“If you’ll excuse me, sir,” said 
Peter, “I don’t see where I fit in.” 
Peter didn’t realize Lexington 
was answering his question at first. 
“A few weeks ago,” the old man 
murmured, “I decided to see a doctor. I’d been feeling low for quite a 
while, and I thought it was about 
time I attended to a little personal 
maintenance.” 
Lexington looked Peter squarely 
in the face and said, “The report 
was that I have a heart ailment 
that’s apt to knock me off any 
second.” 
“Can’t anything be done about 
it?” asked Peter. 
“Rest is the only prescription he 
could give me. And he said that 
would only spin out my life a little. 
Aside from that — no hope.” 
“I see,” said Peter. “Then you’re 
looking for someone to learn the 
business and let you retire.” 
“It’s not retirement that’s the 
problem,” said Lexington. “I 
wouldn’t be able to go away on 
trips. I’ve tried that, and I always 
have to hurry back because something’s gone wrong she can’t fix for 
herself. I know the reason, and 
there’s nothing I can do about it. 
It’s the way she’s built. If nobody’s 
here, she gets lonely.” Lexington 
studied the desk top silently for a 
moment, before finishing quietly, 
“Somebody’s got to stay here to 
look after Lex.” 
A T six o’clock, three hours after 
he had entered Lexington’s 
plant, Peter left. Lexington did not 
follow him down the corridor. He 
seemed exhausted after the afternoon’s discussion and indicated that 
Peter should find his own way out 
This, of course, presented no difficulty, with Lex opening the doors 
for him, but it gave Peter an opportunity he had been hoping for. 
He stopped in the reception 
room before crossing the threshold 
of the front door, which stood open 
for him. He turned and spoke to the 
apparently empty room. “Lex?” he 
said. 
He wanted to say that he was 
flattered that he was being considered for the job; it was what a jobseeker should say, at that point, to 
the boss’s secretary. But when the 
soft voice came back — “Yes, Mr. 
LEX 
Manners?” — saying anything like 
that to a machine felt suddenly 
silly. 
He said: “I wanted you to know 
that it was a pleasure to meet you.” 
“Thank you,” said the voice. 
If it had said more, he might 
have, but it didn’t. Still feeling a 
little embarrassed, he went home. 
At four in the morning, his phone 
rang. It was Lexington. 
“Manners!” the old man gasped. 
The voice was an alarm. Manners sat bolt upright, clutching the 
phone. “What’s the matter, sir?” 
“My chest,” Lexington panted. 
“I can feel it, like a knife on — I 
just wanted to — Wait a minute.” 
There was a confused scratching noise, interrupted by a few 
mumbles, in the phone. 
“What’s going on, Mr. Lexington?” Peter cried. But it was several seconds before he got an answer. 
“That’s better,” said Lexington, 
his voice stronger. He apologized: 
“I’m sorry. Lex must have heard 
me. She sent in one of the materials 
handlers with a hypo. It helps.” 
The voice on the phone paused, 
then said matter-of-factly: “But I 
doubt that anything can help very 
much at this point. I’m glad I saw 
you today. I want you to come 
around in the morning. If I’m — not 
here, Lex will give you some papers 
to sign.” 
There was another pause, with 
sounds of harsh breathing. Then, 
strained again, the old man’s voice 
said: “I guess I won’t — be here. 
Lex will take care of it. Come early. 
Good-by.” 
The distant receiver clicked. 
Peter Manners sat on the edge 
of his bed in momentary confusion, 
then made up his mind. In the 
short hours he had known him, he 
had come to have a definite fondness for the old man; and there 
were times when machines weren’t 
enough, when Lexington should 
have another human being by his 
side. Clearly this was one such time. 
Peter dressed in a hurry, miraculously found a cruising cab, sped 
through empty streets, leaped out 
in front of Lex Industries’ plain 
concrete walls, ran to the door — 
In the waiting room, the soft, 
distant voice of Lex said: “He 
wanted you to be here, Mr. Manners. Come.” 
A door opened, and wordlessly 
he walked through it — to the main 
room of the factory. 
He stopped, staring. Four squat 
materials handlers were quietly, 
slowly carrying old Lexington — 
no, not the man; the lifeless body 
that had been Lexington — carrying the body of the old man down 
the center aisle between the automatic lathes. 
"DETER protested: “Wait! I’ll 
get a doctor!” But the massive 
handling machines didn’t respond, 
and the gentle voice of Lex said: 
“It’s too late for that, Mr. Manners.” 
Slowly and reverently, they 
placed the body on the work table 
of a huge milling machine that 
stood in the exact center of the 
factory main floor. 
Elsewhere in the plant, a safety valve in the lubricating oil system was being bolted down. When 
that was done, the pressure in the 
system began to rise. 
Near the loading door, a lubricating oil pipe burst. Another, on 
the other side of the building, split 
lengthwise a few seconds later, 
sending a shower of oil over everything in the vicinity. Near the front 
office, a stream of it was running 
across the floor, and at the rear of 
the building, in the storage area, 
one of the materials handlers had 
just finished cutting a pipe that led 
to the main oil tank. In fifteen minutes there was free oil in every corner of the shop. 
All the materials handlers were 
now assembled around the milling 
machine, like mourners at a funeral. 
In a sense, they were. In another 
sense, they were taking part in 
something different, a ceremony 
that originated, and is said to have 
died, in a land far distant from the 
Lex Industries plant. 
One of the machines approached 
Lexington’s body, and placed his 
hands on his chest. 
Abruptly Lex said: “You’d better go now.” 
Peter jumped; he had been 
standing paralyzed for what 
seemed a long time. There was a 
movement beside him — a materials handler, holding out a sheaf 
of papers. Lex said : “These have to 
go to Mr. Lexington’s lawyer. The 
name is on them.” 
Clutching the papers for a hold 
on sanity, Peter cried, “You can’t 
do this! He didn’t build you just so 
you could—” 
Two materials handlers picked 
him up with steely gentleness and 
carried him out. 
“Good-by, Mr. Manners,” said 
the sweet, soft voice, and was silent. 
TIE stood shaken while the thin 
jets of smoke became a column over the plain building, while 
the fire engines raced down and 
strung their hoses — too late. It was 
an act of suttee; the widow joining 
her husband in his pyre — being his 
pyre. Only when with a great crash 
the roof fell in did Peter remember 
the papers in his hand. 
“Last Will and Testament,” said 
one, and the name of the beneficiary was Peter’s own. “Certificate 
of Adoption,” said another, and it 
was a legal document making Peter 
old man Lexington’s adopted son. 
Peter Manners stood watching 
the hoses of the firemen hiss 
against what was left of Lex and 
her husband. 
He had got the job.

TALE OF TWO FUTURES by 
Wm. P. Heyrte. Exposition Press, 
N.Y., $3.00 
A PRAISEWORTHY attempt 
at the difficult feat of mixing 
the Bible, angels and modem SF, 
★ ★ ★ ★ ★ SHELF 
a theme certain of failure under 
less than a master’s hand. Heyne is 
not a master. 
ALIENS FROM SPACE by 
David Osborne. Avalon Books, 
N.Y., $2.75 
O SBORNE’S (R. Silverberg) 
last for Avalon, Invisible Barriers, was also a smooth job featuring alien invaders. On prominent 
display here are two sets, violent 
opposites, with Earth courting 
destruction whichever side she 
chooses, though choose she must. 
The contrived ending provokes 
skepticism. 
Still, pleasant reading. 
THE LANGUAGES OF PAO by 
Jack Vance. Avalon Books, N.Y., 
$2.75 
S ILVERBERG-GARRETT’S 
Shrouded Planet also concerned the jolting of a static civilization out of stagnation by the 
undermining of old beliefs. Vance 
applies the One World Doctrine in 
reverse instead : the introduction of 
synthetic, dynamic languages into 
a monolingual world, thereby 
changing slothful into active mental characteristics. A good idea well 
handled. 
THE TIME TRADERS by Andre 
Norton. World Publishing Co., 
Cleveland & N.Y., $3.00 
M ISS Norton’s last book, Star 
Gate, employed an alternatetime-sequence gadget. A time plate 
serves to heat up her present plot 
of the U.S. in a race through and 
against time. The Russians have 
assumed technological superiority 
with developments so new in concept that they must have come 
from an alien culture. 
The Pentagon-inspired search 
through ancient time for the fountainhead is clearly a device to enable her to create her usual savage 
environment for her bloodily unbowed hero. No quibble, though — 
Traders gets Miss Norton back 
solidly and admirably on her track 
of excellence. 
HAVE SPACE SUIT, WILL 
TRAVEL by Robert A. Heinlein. 
Charles Scribner’s Sons, N.Y., 
$2.95 
A LTHOUGH serialized as adult 
fare, this is possibly the most 
unabashedly juvenile of Heinlein’s 
long list 
It concerns a teen-ager who 
wins an obsolete but serviceable 
spacesuit in a contest and his adventures with it. Great for kids, 
chancy for grownups who don’t 
identify readily with adolescent 
heroes. 
UNDERSEA CITY by Frederik 
Pohl and Jack Williamson. Gnome 
Press, Hicksville, N.Y., $2.75 
E arthquake forecasting, a 
necessity if underwater cities 
are ever to become realities, is the 
theme of Number Three in the 
Pohl-Williamson undersea cadet 
series. Frankly and honestly a geewhiz yarn, it reaches its target — 
youngsters — with plenty of mystery, action and suspense. 
DANNY DUNN AND THE 
HOMEWORK MACHINE by 
Jay Williams and Raymond Abashkin. Whittlesey House, N.Y., $2.95 
’ I ' HE authors of D.D. and the Anti-Gravity Paint team up for 
another funful adventure. Bullfinch, the absent-minded prof, presents the wherewithal by inventing 
a computer which Danny perverts 
to this unethical purpose. Of course 
the situation is resolved and a 
moral pointed. 
SPACE CAT AND THE KITTENS by Ruthven Hodd. Chas.

"IVT Y youngsters penned their 
own reviews of Space Cat

F ROM the moment he opened 
his eyes and saw the color 
of the sky, the shape of the 
clouds, the incredible topography, 
Carter Broun knew exactly where 
he was. 
He didn’t really have to identify the blandly sweet smell which 
filled his nostrils, nor did he particularly have to investigate further 
the river of dark mahogany coursing, with the gentlest of roars, be
By WILLIAM TENN 
milk monster 
Illustrated by DILLON 
tween two small, cone-shaped hills, 
two hills of exactly the same dimensions and sporting exactly the same 
vegetation. 
There was just no doubt about 
it. Not after Carter had contem
plated, for ten or fifteen awe-struck 
seconds, the sky of absolutely uniform and brilliant blue — blueyblue, that was the color, he decided 
morosely — and those oval, pinkwhite clouds spaced so evenly 
THE MALTED MILK MONSTER 
across it. Not to mention those 
birds flapping into the narrowing 
distance; from here, each looked 
like a letter V, the arms of which 
had been carefully curved outward 
and down. 
Only one place in the universe 
boasted such a landscape, such an 
atmosphere, such birds. This was 
The World of The Malted Milk 
Monster. 
God help me, Carter thought, 
now ifs my world, too. 
That peculiar, ripping flash inside him, like some sort of lightning of the soul! He’d said good-by 
to Lee at the door of her lawn-enclosed home and started down the 
neat suburban street to where his 
MG was parked. He’d been rolling 
the car keys around in his hand and 
planning the itinerary of his Friday 
night date with Lee — you either 
got a girl to your apartment by the 
second date, he had found, or you 
flunked out forever — when he’d 
noticed the Malted Milk Monster 
watching him unwinkingly from behind a hedge. Probably had followed them all the way from 
Goldie’s Goodie Palace. 
Then the flash, the mad sensation of being ripped out of his context and being shoved into another, 
entirely different place. And opening his eyes here. 
T T all came, and the knowledge 
was bitter, of taking your date 
to an ice cream parlor instead of 
an honest bar. But a bar didn’t seem 
like the right follow-up to a Sunday afternoon movie in Grenville 
Acres. Besides, you don’t take a 
schoolteacher to a bar on her home 
grounds. You pour an inoffensive 
soda into her, walk her home 
through the autumn streets, being 
as gentlemanly charming as possible, you decline the invitation to 
come in and meet the folks by 
mentioning the MR report you 
have to prepare for tomorrow’s Account Executive* conference — a 
man has his work to do, and that 
must come first — and back you 
drive to Manhattan with the pleasant knowledge of a seduction intelligently initiated. 
Unfortunately, you don’t plan 
on other factors — unseen powers, 
for example. 
There was not much point in 
checking, but he might as well 
check. Once he was really certain, 
he could begin worrying. And working out an escape. 
Carter wandered down to the 
mahogany river across wellcropped grass and past large tinseltype flowers. He knelt, dipped a 
finger in the thick liquid and tasted 
it. Chocolate. Of course. 
Just on the off-chance, he 
pinched himself long and hard, 
squeezingly and painfully. It hurt 
enough. No, he’d known he hadn’t 
been dreaming to begin with. For 
one thing, in a dream you rarely 
realize you’re dreaming. 
This was real. 
Chocolate syrup to drink. And 
for food — 
The two little hills were covered 
with dwarf trees bearing lollipops, 
the cellophane-wrapped fruit varying slightly in color from tree to 
tree. Here and there on the level 
ground were bonbon bushes and 
sharply triangular Christmas-tree 
affairs from whose twigs dangled 
small pies, cakes and assorted 
cookies — most of them chocolate. 
The sun beat down rosily, rosily, 
and none of the chocolate melted. 
The chocolate river, on the other 
hand, ran interminably and gurglingly. Whatever its sources, 
wherever it rose, the river evidently had plenty of reserves. 
Carter was struck by an especially ugly thought. Suppose, viewing the river’s affluence, suppose it 
rained chocolate! Really, one could 
not put anything past the Malted 
Milk Monster. 
L EE had objected to the name. 
“She’s just a fat little girl. 
Rather brilliant, rather neurotic, 
too. And very curious about the 
strange, distinguished young man 
who’s buying her teacher a soda.” 
“All right, but I’ve been counting,” Carter had insisted. “Five 
chocolate malteds since we came 
in. Five! And the way she sits there 
at the end of the counter, never 
taking her eyes off us, not even 
when she unwraps a fresh straw!” 
THE MALTED MILK MONST! 
“Most of the children in Grenville have more spending money 
than is good for them. Dorothy’s 
parents are divorced — mother’s a 
big-time buyer, father’s a vice-president of a bank — and they use 
their money to fight for her affections. She spends practically all of 
her time in Goldie’s. You know, 
Carter, that psychological equation: when I was small and my 
parents loved me, they gave me 
food; therefore, food equals love?” 
Carter nodded. He knew all 
about such psychological equations. 
As a determined and well-sexed 
young bachelor, he had studied 
Freud as intently as a second lieutenant in the First World War 
might have studied von Clausewitz. 
“You’re so damned feminine,” he 
announced warmly, underlining the 
points that, with any luck at all, 
would shortly be at issue. “Only a 
gal who was woman all the way 
through would be able to see in that 
ball of lard, that pimply Malted 
Milk Monster—” 
“She’s no such thing, Carter! 
What a terrible nickname for such 
a mixed-up little girl! Although,” 
Lee mused, swirling the long spoon 
about in the residual muddy bubbles of her soda glass, “although it 
is funny you should think of it 
That’s what — or something like it 
— the other kids in the class call 
her. They tell stories about her — 
that she can make stones and flowerpots disappear just by staring 
R 147 
hard at them. Kids are just like 
adults, a little more obvious, that’s 
all. They make a witch out of the 
unpopular one.” 
He kept trying. “They never 
made one out of you, that’s for sure. 
Anybody who’s the slightest bit 
sensitive just has to look at you to 
know that love and loving—” 
“It’s so pathetic, really,” she interrupted without knowing it. “I 
asked them to write a composition 
about the happiest day they could 
remember. Do you know what 
Dorothy wrote about? A day in her 
dream world, a day that never ever 
happened. And yet it was beautifully done, for a child her age. Full 
of affection-symbols like cake and 
candy. The world was supposed to 
smell like an ice cream parlor. 
Imagine! There was a finely written passage — you appreciate good 
writing, Carter, I know — about 
two cute little hills all covered with 
lollipop trees, each tree bearing a 
different flavor. And between the 
hills there wound a stream of purest 
chocolate!” 
I" 1 ARTER gave up. He lit a cigarette and stared over Lee’s 
earnest but nonetheless lovely 
head. At the grossly heavy little girl 
whose fat overflowed the last stool 
in the ice cream parlor, her mouth 
sucking steadily at the chocolate 
malted milk, her eyes as steadily 
sucking at his. He found himself 
forced to drop his glance first. 
“—even when we have a drawing lesson,” Lee was still on it. “She 
never does anything else. It’s absolutely real to the poor child — so 
lonely, so starved for companionship! I’ve learned to expect that 
flat blue sky full of oval pink clouds, 
those curved-line birds, that chocolate river and all those bushes filled 
with goodies. Every single time! 
For a child of her intelligence, she’s 
somewhat retarded graphically. 
She draws like a child a year or two 
younger. But that’s to be expected : 
it’s almost purely a verbal, a conceptual intelligence, you might 
say—” 
You might also say the topic had 
created a highly annoying and useless diversion. Carter bit on the 
cigarette through his lips, looked up 
again cautiously. The Malted Milk 
Monster’s eyes were as unwavering 
as ever. Such pulling power — what 
was so fascinating about him? Well, 
her father was a Madison Avenue 
type: the clothes, probably. Carter 
was justly proud of his wardrobe. 
His clothes, he knew, were in almost ostentatious good taste— they 
screamed restraint and expensive 
lowness of key. 
Yes, that was it. He reminded 
her of her father. Her rich father. 
Carter caught himself preening 
and stubbed out the cigarette in 
abrupt harsh disgust. Damn it! 
That was the trouble with this 
Madison Avenue music — you 
laughed at it, you kidded others 
about it, you even read books satirizing it — and then you found yourself singing to it. He reminded her 
of her father who was the vice-president of a bank and probably quite 
well off. Well, so what? Did that 
say anything good about Carter 
Broun? Not necessarily at all, at 
all. Carter Broun was just a welleducated, clever and rather lucky 
young man who had found his way 
into a well-paying, clever and extremely luck-flavored business. 
A young man who had gotten so 
deeply involved in the superficialities of the business that when a 
child as obviously and horrifyingly 
tormented as this little girl came 
to his attention, all he could gee was 
a neat gag nickname — this kind of 
shallow, brilliant thing you’d toss 
off to a client at a sales conference. 
Lee, now. Lee’s roots were still 
wrapped around the compact, 
squirming mass of the human race. 
She loved her work but she cared 
too; she certainly cared. The way 
she goes on! The way her eyes 
shine as she talks! 
“—the other children were positively stupefied. Or that time I 
asked them to make up riddles. Do 
you know what Dorothy asked 
when her turn came? Just listen to 
this, Carter. She asked the class: 
‘Which would you rather— be eaten 
by a giant caterpillar, or a million 
tiny little lions?’ Now I maintain 
that a girl with that much imagination-” 
“That much maladjustment,” he 
corrected. “She sounds like a very 
sick kid. But I’d give a lot,” he 
mused, “to see how she’d do on a 
Rorschach. A giant caterpillar, or 
a million tiny little lions . and 
without even ink-blots to go on! 
Do you know if she’s ever had any 
psychotherapy?” 
TTIS companion had smiled grimly. “Her parents are very well 
off, I told you. I suspect she’s had 
all the advantages. Up to and including protracted legal battles as 
to whether she’s to go to poppa’s 
doctor or momma’s doctor. What 
that girl really needs, no one can 
give her: a different set of parents, 
or, at the least, one parent who 
really cares for her.” 
Carter had disagreed. “Not so 
much now, not at her age. I’d say 
it would be much more helpful at 
this point to have a couple of kids 
who like and accept her. If there’s 
one thing that motivational research brings home to you, it’s what 
thoroughgoing social animals we 
humans are. Without a matrix of 
companionship, without the interest 
and approval of at least a handful 
of our contemporaries, we’re worse 
than mixed up — we aren’t even 
people. Hermits aren’t people; I 
don’t know what they are, exactly, 
but they’re not people. And so long 
as that kid is a psychological hermit, she’s not really a human person. She’s something else.” 
THE MALTED MILK MONSTER 
Somewhere in the next fifteen 
minutes, he knew that he had 
clicked with Lee. But by then he 
was deep in the problem of how one 
could help a kid like Dorothy to 
make friends. It had become an 
MR problem, dealing with the individual, however, rather than the 
group; and, like all MR problems, 
of such obsessing interest to him 
that nothing else mattered. 
In the end, it had been Lee who 
had changed the subject very forcefully; it had been Lee who had to 
drop hints about their next date. 
He’d managed to get a grip on himself and began talking about what 
they’d do when she came into town 
to meet him next Friday night. All 
in all, it had worked out quite well. 
But as they left the soda shop, 
Carter had thrown just one last 
glance behind him through the 
plate-glass window. The Malted 
Milk Monster had turned on her 
stool, straw still in her mouth, eyes 
following him like a pair of starving sharks. 
And then, of course, shadowing 
them all the way to Lee’s home. 
What had she done to him? How 
had she done it? Why? 
TTE kicked angrily at a loose 
stone, watched it bounce into 
the river with a thick brown splash. 
Was this one of the stones Dorothy 
had abstracted from the real world? 
Again, how? Not why, though; it 
could well have been part of a 
series of controlled experiments to 
test the range of her powers. 
Powers? Was that the word? 
Talent, perhaps, or catalytic capacity — that might be more descriptive. 
Given a very remarkable mind, 
given a very strong personality imbedded in a child’s brain, given unhappiness, unpopularity, and general neurosis to sharpen that mind, 
to add even more punch to the personality — and what? What would 
develop? 
He suddenly recalled his last 
thoughts before arriving in this lollipop world. Just after he’d left Lee, 
his head full of happy thoughts 
about Friday night, just at the very 
moment he’d seen the kid staring 
at him, he’d begun thinking about 
her problems again. The realization that she had followed them all 
the way from the soda shop out of 
sheer murderous loneliness had 
stimulated him into wondering 
about her mind. 
There had been a sequence. 
First: Gee, she’s hungry tor people. 
Then: Not for people in general, 
lor kids her own age. How would 
you go about making kids like her? 
Now there’s a motivation problem 
for you! Then: Well, the first question is what are her motives; what’s 
it like in her mind? Good professional MR unraveling technique. 
And then that terrible flash, that 
mental rip, and he’d opened his 
eyes here. 
I N other words, he’d had something to do with it It hadn’t 
been all her. He’d been wide open 
psychologically, trying to visualize 
the inside of her mind, just as she 
had — as she had done something. 
No, it still required something 
from her, for all this to have happened. And no matter what you 
called it — talent, powers, catalysis 
— she had it. And she’d used it on 
him. 
Carter shivered suddenly, remembering the riddle she’d made 
up. 
He was adrift in the fantasy life 
of that kind of kid. He wished he 
had paid attention to Lee’s earlier 
discussion in the ice cream parlor 
instead of forcing the conversation 
back into more lucrative channels. 
To get out safely, to survive, he 
could use every scrap of information on Dorothy that had ever 
existed. 
After all, her most meager wishes 
were now the fixed and immutable 
natural laws under which he had 
to operate. 
He was no longer alone, he observed. He was surrounded by children. They had seemingly materialized all around him, yelling, 
playing, scrambling, jumping. And 
where the yelling was loudest, 
where the games were thickest, 
there was Dorothy. The Malted 
Milk Monster. The children gamboled about her like so many fountains against a central statue. 
She stood there, still staring at 
him. And her stare was as uncomfortable as ever. A little more so, for 
that matter, than he remembered 
it. She wore the same blue jeans 
and yellow cashmere sweater with 
smudges on it. She was taller than 
life-size, a bit taller than the other 
children. She was slenderer, too. 
Now, in all fairness, you could not 
call her more than plump. 
And she had no pimples. 
Carter was irritated at how fast 
he’d had to drop his eyes. But to 
keep them open and aimed at her 
was like looking directly into the 
beam of an anti-aircraft searchlight. 
“Looka me, Dorothy!” the kids 
yelled. “I’m jumping! Looka how 
high I can jump!” 
“How about playing tag, Dorothy?” they yelled. “Let’s play tag! 
You choose who should be It!” 
“Make up a new game, Dorothy! 
Make up one of the good games 
you always make up!” 
“Let’s have a picnic, huh, Dorothy?” 
“Dorothy, let’s have a relay 
race!” 
“Dorothy, let’s play house!” 
“Dorothy, let’s jump rope!” 
“Dorothy-” 
“Dorothy—” 
“Dorothy-” 
T¥7HEN she started to speak, 
” every one of the kids shut 
up. They stopped running, they 
stopped yelling, they stopped what
THE MALTED MILK MONSTER 
ever they were doing and turned to 
look at her. 
“This nice man,” she said. “He’ll 
play with us. Won’t you, mister?” 
“No,” Carter said. “Fd like to, but 
I’m afraid I—” 
“He’ll play a game of ball with 
us,” she went on imperturbably. 
“Here, mister. Here’s the ball. 
You’re a nice man to play with us.” 
When she moved toward him, 
holding out a large striped ball 
which had suddenly appeared in 
her hands, the bulk of the children 
moved with her. 
Carter was still searching for 
words wherewith to explain that 
while he had no interest at the moment in playing a game of ball, he 
was much interested in a private 
conversation with Dorothy herself, 
an audience, so to speak — when 
the ball was thrust into his fingers 
and he found himself playing. 
“You see, I don’t usually—” he 
began as he threw the ball and 
caught it, threw the ball and caught 
it. 
“Very busy right now, but some 
other ti— ” he continued as he caught 
the ball and threw it, caught the 
ball and threw it. 
No matter in which direction he 
threw the ball, no matter how many 
eager pairs of child hands made a 
grab for it, it was always Dorothy 
who received it and threw it back 
to him. 
“Yay, Dorothy!” the children 
yelled. “This is fun!” 
“Be glad to play with you kids 
as soon as I finish my—” Carter 
puffed, finding it fantastically tough 
exercise. 
“Yay, Dorothy! This is a real 
good game!” 
“Such a nice man!” 
“So much fun!” 
Dorothy threw the ball straight 
up in the air and it disappeared. 
“Let’s play leap-frog,” she said. 
“Would you like to play leap-frog 
with us, mister?” 
“Sorry,” Carter gasped as he 
bent, his hands on his knees, so that 
she could leap over his back from 
behind. “I haven’t played leap-frog 
in years and I don’t intend to st— ” 
He ran forward, placed his hands 
in the small of Dorothy’s back, 
sailed across, bent forward again in 
expectation of her jump. “Leapfrog is one game that I never—” 
They played leap-frog until he 
was wobbling with dizziness, until 
every breath felt as if it had been 
clawed out of his chest. 
Dorothy seated herself gracefully on the ground and gathered 
the children in an adoring cluster. 
“Now we’d like to hear a story. 
Please, mister, tell us a story?” 
Carter started an agonized protest. It was somehow transformed 
into the story of Goldilocks and the 
Three Bears, told wheezingly and 
punctuated with heaving gulps for 
air. Then he told the story of Little 
Red Riding Hood. Then he told 
the story of Bluebeard. 
THE MALTED MILK MONSTER 
Somewhere near the end of that 
particular work, Dorothy disappeared. But the children remained, 
and Carter continued the story, 
willy-nilly. The kids began to look 
frightened. Some shivered, others 
moaned and cried. 
T T had been getting darker for the 
past few minutes, and just as 
Carter finished the last lines of 
Bluebeard and, without stopping, 
launched into “Once upon a time 
there was a poor but honest woodcutter who had two children named 
Hansel and Gretel,” a huge black 
cloud slid across the sky and 
swooped down at them. 
A terrifying scarlet face with an 
enormous nose and flashing white 
teeth came out of the cloud and 
roared till the ground shook. Then 
it stopped and began to gnash its 
teeth. This sounded like an explosion in a crockery warehouse. 
The children screamed in pure 
eye-popping terror and ran. “Dorothy!” they shrieked. “Dorothy, save 
us! The Bad Old Man! Save us, 
Dorothy, save us! Dorothy, where 
are you?” 
Carter sank to the grass, released 
and utterly exhausted. He was far 
too tired to run or even look up, far 
too upset to care what happened 
to him any more. It seemed like 
the first time in hours that his body 
was his again to command; but his 
body wasn’t worth very much at 
the moment. 
“Hey, Mac,” a voice queried 
sympathetically over his head. 
“They givin’ you a hard time?” 
It was the scarlet face from the 
cloud. It no longer looked terrifying, merely concerned in a friendly 
fashion. And it was shrinking rapidly in size until it was in correct proportion to the normal human body 
under it. When it was a rather ordinary red and grizzled face, dirty 
with a few days’ growth of beard 
around the red and busily veined 
nose, its owner knelt on the edge 
of the cloud and leaped to the 
ground, a distance, by this time, of 
half a dozen feet. 
He was an oldish man of middle 
height, wearing a pair of solid gray 
pants, a tom brown shirt which 
hung outside it down to his hips 
and, on his bare feet, two frayed 
and filthy canvas shoes, one of 
which was split at the sole. He 
looked familiar, as every bum 
somehow looks like every other 
bum. He was the very essence of 
shambling, sodden derelict, a pure 
example of absolute human junk, 
but— 
He was an adult. 
Carter sprang up and offered his 
hand joyfully. It was shaken in a 
flabby, uncertain, half-cringing way, 
like a newly paroled prisoner taking his farewell of the warden. 
“Could you use a drink, Mac?” 
“I sure as hell could,” Carter told 
him heartily. “Am I glad to see 
you!” 
The derelict nodded vaguely, 
reached up and pulled the black 
cloud even closer. He fumbled inside and pulled a bottle out. It was 
about half full, but though the fluid 
it contained was the proper shade 
of amber, it was clear glass all the 
way around. No label. 
He held out this beggar’s choice. 
“Name’s Eddie. What they call me 
Shirttail. You need a glass to drink 
from? Ain’t no glasses.” 
Carter shrugged. He sterilized 
the open top of the bottle with the 
palm of his hand, put it to his mouth 
and took a broad gulp. 
“Whouch!" he said. 
TIE found himself coughing so 
hard that he almost dropped 
the bottle. Shirttail took it away 
from him solicitously. “Awful, ain’t 
it?” he asked, then proceeded to 
belt down a third of the stuff. 
Awful, Carter decided, was not 
quite the word for it It tasted like 
whiskey, all right, somewhere way 
down at the bottom, but with an 
overlay consisting of iodine, ammonia, camphor and dilute hydrochloric acid. His tongue squirmed 
in his mouth like a trapped snake. 
Shirttail removed the bottle 
from his mouth, shuddered, grimaced, and licked his lips. “That’s 
what she thinks whiskey tastes 
like.” 
“Who? Dorothy?” 
“Atsit. The kid — whatever she 
thinks something tastes like, that’s 
what it tastes like. But it’s better’n 
nothing, better’n no booze at all. 
Wanna come up to the place? We 
can sit a while.” 
He was pointing to the cloud 
which hung low over them, a dark 
and misshapen dirigible. Doubtfully, Carter grabbed some of its tenuous material and pulled himself up. 
It was like swimming through fog 
that felt solid only at the places 
your hands touched it. 
A soaring black cavern of a 
room. Off in a corner — a niche, 
rather, since there were no corners 
— stood an army cot covered with 
ragged plaid blankets, a table-full of 
cracked cups and saucers, and three 
sagging, garbagey-looking easy 
chairs. An unshaded light bulb hung 
from a thin wire over the cot and 
burned tinily, resentfully, in the 
piles of gloom. Whether or not the 
area behind the cot could properly 
be called a wall, it was covered 
from top to bottom with glossy pictures of naked women. 
“Not my idea — hers,” Shirttail 
explained as he clambered up 
through the floor. “Everything’s 
hers, every idea, everything. What 
she once saw the inside of a nightwatchman’s shack, I figure. What to 
her I’m the same kinda guy as the 
night-watchman, so that’s the layout I get. But thank God for the 
bottle. The pictures, far as I’m concerned, you can have, but the bottle 
— thank God for the bottle.” 
He offered it to Carter, who 
THE MALTED MILK MONSTER 
shook his head and hand in a no. 
They sat in two facing easy chairs, 
each of which immediately settled 
off to one side in opposite directions. Damn it, Carter thought, I 
have seen him before. But where? 
“Take a slug, Mac, go ahead, 
take a slug. One good thing she’s 
got here, that kid — the bottle gets 
full as fast as you kill it. You ain’t 
takin’ nothin’ from me when you 
help yourself. And if you don’t 
drink regular, you’ll be talkin’ to 
yourself. What you won’t talk 
sense.” 
Carter considered the point and 
saw it might well be valid. He took 
another drink. It was fully as bad 
as the first, but the effects of the 
alcohol came through more strongly now and tended to insulate 
against the flavor. He sighed and 
swallowed some more. No doubt 
about it, the world — even Dorothy’s world — looked better. 
He handed the bottle back and 
studied his companion. Hardly the 
right type for this place, when you 
came right down to it. A bum. A 
very average old bum. Why him 
as The Bad Old Man? 
“How long have you been here?” 
Carter asked him. 
C HIRTTAIL shrugged and 
^ stared loose-lipped over the top 
of the bottle. “A year, maybe. Two 
years, maybe. What there’s no way 
to figure. Sometimes winter one 
day, sometimes summer tomorrow. 
What even my beard don’t grow no 
more after I came. I feel like years 
and years and years and years. 
Worsen stir, worsen anything. The 
things I been through here, Mac, 
the things I been through!” 
“Bad?” Carter asked sympathetically. 
“Bad?” Shirttail indicated just 
how bad by rolling his red eyes in 
an emphatic upward arc. “Bad 
don’t come near. I got to go out 
and scare those kids whenever she 
wants me to. What I’m in the sack, 
what I got other things on my mind, 
don’t make no difference. Dorothy 
gives out with a think: ‘Come arunnin’ and start a-scarin’.’ I got to 
drop whatever I’m doin’. I’m in the 
sack, what the hell, I got other 
things on my mind, I got to drop 
it and start a-scarin’. I blow up big 
like you just saw me, I got to 
scream and bang my choppers, I 
got to zoom on down. Then the 
kids yell: ‘Dorothy, save us!’ and 
she starts takin’ me apart. What I 
mean apart. The things she’s done 
to me, biff! bam! pow! pam!, 
slapped me silly, up, down, around, 
every which way, for a-scarin’ those 
kids! What it wasn’t my idea in the 
first place. I just do it ’cause she 
gives out with a think and makes 
me do it.” 
“Ever try resisting, refusing?” 
Carter inquired. “I mean what happens if you say no?” 
“Mac, you don’t say no. You just 
don’t. Everything here goes her 
way. When she itches, you scratch. 
When she sneezes, you wipe your 
nose. What I used to call her all 
kindsa names to myself, just to pass 
the time — Mac, I don’t remember 
a single one now. I try to remember 
one dirty name and I can’t, to save 
my skin. She’s just Dorothy. That’s 
all I can call her. You know what 
I mean? Everything goes her way, 
even inside your head. The only 
leeway you get is to stay the kinda 
guy she sees you as in the first place. 
But otherwise it’s her way, and the 
longer you stick around, the more 
her way it is.” 
Carter remembered with dismay 
how little he had wanted to play 
ball or leap-frog and how thoroughly he had played. Worse, how he 
had told stories when he had intended to protest. And worse yet, he 
hadn’t — even in his own mind — 
used the phrase The Malted Milk 
Monster for some time now! He 
had thought of her, had referred to 
her, only as Dorothy. 
“And the longer you stick 
around—” 
He had to get out of here, had 
to find some way to smash out of 
this world — fast. 
Shirttail was offering the bottle 
again. Carter refused it impatiently. Escape, breaking out, that came 
first. And for that he’d need his 
mind at its clearest. The alternative was being slowly absorbed, 
psychologically as well as physically, into Dorothy’s dream world, un
til even his thoughts would be only 
slightly eccentric versions of her 
image of him, and he would be 
caught, like a fly immortalized by 
amber, in whatever habitation and 
whatever role she visualized for 
The Nice Man. 
T'' HE Nice Man! He shivered. 
What a way to spend the rest 
of his life! No, now, while he was 
still more or less himself, Carter 
Broun, while his brain still glittered 
with the edge of a bright young 
motivational research executive in 
the real world, now was the time to 
break through. 
The real world. As good a name 
for it as any other. Carter was a 
mystic never and a Freudian only 
when the occasion suited him. His 
credo was simple: anything that 
is is real. So . 
Postulate a cosmos sufficiently 
long in extension and sufficiently 
broad in possibility, and there has 
to be room somewhere in all its infinities for every kind of world that 
Man could imagine. 
Or a child dream up. 
And suppose a child, out of overpowering longing and loneliness, 
out of some incredible innate talent, 
perhaps, is able to break through 
the folds of cosmic enormities into 
the one cranny where its dream 
world exists as a tangible, everyday 
truth. Not much of a step from 
there to switching other individuals, 
adults even, stones and flowerpots 
THE MALTED MILK MONSTER 
certainly, from one universe to the 
other. The original supposition, 
Carter decided, was the difficult 
one. Once that was accepted, the 
others were easy. 
In an unlimited number of parallel worlds, to find the true home of 
one’s mind . 
Was that what Dorothy had 
done? And, in that case, which 
would be the dream world, which 
the real? You could probably die 
in either with equal ease — so that 
was no criterion. 
Well, what difference did it 
make? The real world, for Carter, 
was the world from which he had 
been pulled, the world in which he 
had standing, individuality and personal purpose. The world he liked 
and intended to return to. And this, 
this other world, no matter how 
substantial unto itself in its peculiar 
space-time matrix, was the dream 
world — the world he must flee. The 
world that he had to prove, against 
the logic of his very senses, did not 
exist — by leaving it, or by destroying it somehow. 
Destroying . 
He stared hard at Shirttail. No 
wonder the derelict had looked so 
familiar! 
It had been the briefest glimpse, 
weeks ago, possibly months, but 
the word brought back the sententious caption under that unforgettable photograph. 
A tabloid newspaper on a printwet, newly arrived pile he’d noticed 
over his shoulder as he’d been passing the newsstand at 53rd Street, 
just off Madison. And he’d had to 
stop and take another look at the 
photograph spreading its shock 
value over a sector of the front page. 
A MAN WHO DESTROYED 
HIMSELF was the caption’s headline. 
The caption went on to explain, 
in the most appalled journalese, 
that this was what you might expect to look like if you spent the 
rest of your life not working, sleeping in doorways, and drinking, instead of eating, your meals. “Even 
hardened interns and nurses at the 
hospital averted their faces from 
this terrible thing that had once 
been a man (story on Page 23).” 
"D UT the photograph did show a 
terrible thing that had once 
been a man. He was shown in the 
alley as he’d been found, shown 
just as the stretcher was being 
lifted, and you weren’t likely to 
forget him for a long, long time. 
The worst part of it was that he 
was alive. The eyes stared into the 
lens of the camera without any pretense of seeing. There was no mark 
on the face or body, no blood, nothing but dirt, and yet you had the 
feeling that this was a man who had 
fallen out of a window ten stories 
up or been hit by a car speeding at 
ninety miles an hour — and not 
been killed. Not completely killed, 
anyway, just partially killed. 
The body lay and the eyes stared 
and the man was alive, but nothing 
more than that could be said. Looking at the picture, you suddenly 
thought of complex organic compounds that were almost living 
creatures but had not yet made 
the grade. The flabby, sheer nonconsciousness of this yet-sentient 
creature made catatonia seem in 
comparison a rather jolly, extremely active state. 
According to the caption, he had 
been found looking like this in an 
alley; he had been removed to a 
large city hospital, and, after ten 
hours, the doctors had not been able 
to do a single thing with him. No 
response at all. 
Carter remembered the picture 
well. It had been a picture of Shirttail. 
Somewhere, at this very moment, possibly in a hospital in 
Grenville Acres, before the eyes of 
a terrified, a nauseated Lee, there 
was another body that bore a physical resemblance to one Carter 
Broun, but that in every important 
respect looked exactly like that horrible photograph. A body that 
was barely alive, that would not 
respond to any stimuli, that could 
do no more than exist — since its 
consciousness was elsewhere. 
Here, in Dorothy’s private chocolate-candy world. 
He had to get out of this place. 
No matter what, he was going to 
get out of this place. 
Only he’d need something close 
to dynamite. Psychological dynamite. 
“—even cut my throat,” Shirttail was going on heavily. “Oh, I 
maybe coulda cut my throat at the 
beginning, if I’da thoughta it. Too 
late now: I’m stopped cold any 
time I try. What I tried starving 
myself, but no go. Only candy to 
eat ina first place. Anybody can 
kick candy — it don’t do no good, 
though. You don’t hafta eat here, 
don’t even hafta breathe. You stop 
breathin’, you don’t croak. Fact, 
Mac, fact. I done it Hours and 
hours you can hold your breath: 
nothin’ happens. Nothin’ happens 
but what she wants to happen. And 
that’s all. That’s it.” 
C ARTER suggested, desperately trying to drag an elementary idea out of the concept of parallel universes, “How about the two 
of us getting together here and talking things over, just as we’re doing? 
If we mapped out some workable 
sort of plan right now, it would be 
something she wouldn’t like to have 
happen — but if we did, it would be 
real — it would have happened.” 
“Mac, you still don’t get it. If you 
and me are together talkin’, then 
someway or other that’s the way 
she wants it. What she figures we go 
together, like, and we oughta be 
talkin’ or bein’ together. Meanwhile, she’s workin’ it out. What 
she’s gonna do next. What we ain’t 
THE MALTED MILK MONSTER 
gonna like it one damn bit, but so 
what? — far’s she’s concerned.” 
Carter frowned, not at Shirttail’s 
last remarks, but at an unexpected 
and highly uncomfortable corroboration. He had suddenly felt an 
enormous tugging sensation in both 
his mind and body. Something was 
pulling at him to leave the cloud 
and descend to the candied surface. 
Dorothy was coming back. She 
wanted him on the spot once more. 
She had a new sequence. Carter 
fought the tug grimly. He began to 
perspire. 
The tug grew stronger. And 
stronger. 
He squeezed his hands into tight, 
painful fists. “The Malted Milk 
Monster,” he forced himself to say 
between clenched teeth. “Remember — The Malted Milk Monster.” 
Shirttail looked up, intrigued. 
“Hey,” he said. “Do me a favor, 
Mac — cuss her out. It’ll do me 
good, honest, to hear a coupla good, 
first-class cuss words. Even if I 
won’t remember them worth a 
damn, I’d still like to hear them 
again, just for old time’s sake. Hey, 
Mac?” 
Carter, threshing about in the 
chair, elbows digging into his sides, 
immersed in his own private struggle, shook his head. “No,” he gasped. 
“Can’t. Not now.” 
“I know. It’s tough. What I mean, 
tough. Like when I first come, I 
used to battle it out the same way, 
every time I feel her give out with a 
think. I battle and I battle, and 
it’s no go. I been moochin’ all day, 
see, up and down the East Fifties, 
Sutton Place, all like that. I been 
moochin’ for the price of a flop, for 
the price of a shot, but not a chance. 
What it’s so cold, my back’s draggin’ the sidewalk, but the whole 
goddam world’s got its pocket buttoned. Comes night, no flop. The 
whole night, I carry the banner. I 
stay awake, I keep walkin’, what I 
don’t wanna freeze. Five, six o’clock 
in the mornin’, there’s this can, 
there’s half a fifth right on top in a 
bagfulla garbage. I hit it, oh, I hit 
it good.” 
Against his most determined 
mental opposition, Carter found 
himself getting to his feet. He knew 
his face was turning purple with the 
effort. He had to stop her now. He 
had to. It was the only way to invalidate her world. 
But the Malt — Dorothy was 
calling him. 
C HIRTTAIL rubbed a trembling 
^ filthy forefinger up and down 
the neck of the bottle. “And then I 
see this little alleyway between the 
buildings, what there’s supposed 
to be a gate locking it off but it’s 
been left open. I go in, it’s dark, 
but there’s a grating, hot air coming up from a basement, and I’m 
outa the wind. Sack time. What I 
think I’m one lucky old bum, but 
it’s the last time I think about luck. 
I wake up, it’s light, there’s this kid, 
this Dorothy lookin’ at me. Lookin’, 
lookin’. She’s got a big ball in her 
hands and she’s standin’ there 
lookin’ at me. She points to the 
bottle. 
“ ‘That’s my daddy’s bottle,’ she 
says. ‘He threw it out last night, 
after the party. But it’s his bottle.’ I 
don’t want no trouble with kids in 
this neighborhood, and I don’t like 
the way it feels the way she looks. 
‘Scat, kid,’ I say, and I sack out 
again. What I wake up next, here 
I am. I got the bottle and that’s all 
I got. Mac, from that time on, it’s 
rough. What I mean, rough. She 
had things here then, big things, 
things with legs and all kindsa— ” 
As if he were willing and even 
desirous of doing it, Carter turned 
his back on The Bad Old Man and 
began walking down through black 
fog. Behind him, the words continued to splash out like liquid from 
a steadily shaken glass. Carter’s 
legs walked in direct contradiction 
to the nerve impulses they were receiving. 
He couldn’t refuse, couldn’t resist. That much was obvious. As 
well try to refuse, to resist, the 
Flood of forty days and forty 
nights, or the sun that Joshua made 
to stand still. Another way. He 
must find another way to fight. 
Meanwhile, he had to come as she 
demanded. 
Dorothy was waiting for him on 
a patch of well-mown grass near a 
pink and green bonbon bush. As he 
came down beside her, she glanced 
away from him for a moment and 
at the dark cloud. 
It disappeared. 
What happened to Shirttail, Carter wondered — had he been wiped 
out for good? Or temporarily relegated to some sort of Limbo of 
reverie? 
And then he really saw Dorothy 
— and the changes she had made. 
She was still wearing the blue 
jeans, but the cashmere sweater 
was clean, perfectly clean. A bright, 
brand-new yellow. And she was 
taller. And she was even more slender than she had been before. 
But that yellow cashmere 
sweater! 
It was filled with two impossibly 
protruding breasts that belonged 
on a poster in front of a cheap 
movie house announcing the triumphant attributes of a Hollywood 
love goddess. 
The rest of her body was still 
childlike, seemingly even more so 
than when he had first seen her, but 
this was due to the caricature effect of that incredible bosom. 
Except — 
Y es, except for the smear of red 
across each lip, the lumps of mascara at the tips of the eyelashes, and 
the clashing, smashing colors on 
her fingernails. Did this mean — 
He shook his head uncertainly, 
irritably. He hadn’t counted on 
anything like this. Whatever it was. 
THE MALTED MILK MONSTER 
“So,” Dorothy simpered at last. 
“We meet again.” 
“It was meant to be,” Carter 
found himself breathing. “We two 
have a common destiny. We live 
under the same strange star.” 
ALK about your precocious 
kids! But where did she get the 
dialogue, he wondered frantically 
— movies? Television drama? 
Books? Or out of her own complexcrammed head? And what did he 
represent in it? Her role was obvious: she was blatantly competing with Lee. 
There was a struggling wisp of 
uncombed thought: Lee and who 
else? But over and around it was 
the horrified knowledge that he was 
saying things he would never say 
of his own volition. How soon before he’d be thinking such cliches? 
And there was a memory at the 
back of his mind — he had a name 
for her that was very much his own 
creation, very hard to remember, 
but he had to remember it, something like, rather like, let’s see now 
— Dorothy. The only name for her 
there was. 
But that hadn’t been it No. 
He thought in pitiful, despairing 
wing-flaps, like an ostrich trying to 
fly. Awful, awful. He had to touch 
his own real personality somehow. 
He had to break through. 
Shatter— 
“Is your love then so strong, so 
truly true?” she demanded. “You 
THE MALTED MILK MONSTER 
have not forgotten me after all this 
time? Look into my eyes and tell 
me so. Tell me that your heart still 
belongs to me alone.” 
No, I won’t, he groaned. He 
looked into her eyes. I can’t! Not 
such absolute baloney. And she’s a 
kid — a little girl! 
“Do you doubt me, my darling?” 
he said softly, the sentences coming out of him in so many punchedout breaths. “Don’t ever, ever doubt 
me. You are the only one for me, 
forever and always, as long as there 
is a sky overhead and an earth beneath. You and I, forever and always.” 
He had to stop. She was getting 
complete control over him. He said 
whatever she wanted him to say. 
And he was going to think it, too. 
But he couldn’t prevent the words 
from flowing out of his mouth, once 
it was his turn, once she had finished and was waiting— 
Dorothy looked off into the distance toward the two hills of equal 
height. Her eyes were misty, and, 
in spite of himself, Carter felt a 
catch in his throat. Ridiculous! And 
yet how sad . 
“I almost feared your love,” she 
mused. “I grew lonely and came 
to believe—” 
Now. While she was doing the 
talking. While the full force of her 
mind was not turned compellingly 
upon him. Make it real. That’s the 
way to bust this dream world. Make 
it real. 
He reached for her. 
“—that you had forgotten and 
found another. How was I to 
know—” 
He grabbed at her. 
He made it real. 
There was an instant when the 
ground shook under his feet, when 
there was a ripping sound from one 
end to another of the solid blue sky. 
There was just one instant when he 
exulted. 
Then Dorothy turned wide, terror-stricken eyes at him. And 
screamed! 
tfER scream was the loudest 
thing in the universe. It went 
on and on and on, deafeningly. Yet 
he wasn’t deafened, because he 
heard it all, every bit of it from the 
beginning, in each and every note 
of its immense range, all of its skullpowdering volume, all of its volcanic fear. 
Not ony Dorothy screamed. The 
candy trees screamed. The cookie 
bushes screamed. The two hills 
screamed. The chocolate river 
stood up between its screaming 
banks and screamed. The stones, 
the very air screamed. 
And the ground fell apart and 
Carter Brouh dropped into it. He 
dropped for centuries, he dropped 
for eons, he dropped for galactic 
eternities. Then he stopped dropping, stopped screaming himself, 
took his hands from his ears and 
looked around. 
He was inside a dull gray, perfectly spherical, perfectly featureless vault. There were no doors and 
no windows, no seams and no 
cracks anywhere in the curving surface all about him. It was absolutely impenetrable and absolutely 
soundproof. 
It had to be, he began to realize, 
as he scuttled dizzily around and 
around inside it. It had to be im
penetrable and soundproof. It had 
to be at the bottommost bottom of 
the dream world, so that no sight 
and no sound from it should ever 
reach Dorothy’s consciousness. 
It was a total repression, this 
chamber of her mind, built to hide 
the deadly dangerous memory that 
was himself — built to last as long as 
Dorothy lasted.

Shotgun logic 
to win an impossible war 
needs only logic and a shotgun 
. but an impossible peace 
can't be won the same way . 
or can it? 
Illustrated by WOOD 
I 
A FTER old man Tighe conquered the country (oh, 
now, listen. I already told 
you about that. Don’t pester me for 
the same story over and over again. 
You remember about the Great 
March, from Eung’s Corners to the 
Pentagon, and how Honest Jack 
Tighe, the Father of the Second 
Republic, overcame the massed 
might of the greatest nation of the 
world with a shotgun and a .22 rifle. 
Of course you do.) 
Anyway. After old man Tighe 
conquered the country, things went 
pretty well for a while. 
Oh, it was a pleasant time and a 
great one! He changed the world, 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
Jack Tighe did. He took a pot of 
strong black coffee into his room— 
it was the Lincoln Study, as it was 
called at the time; now, of course, 
we know it as Tighe’s Bedchamber 
- and sat up all one night, writing, 
and when the servants came wonderingly to him the next morning, 
there it was: the Bill of Wrongs. 
See if you can remember them. 
Everybody learns them by heart. 
Surely you did too : 
1. The first wrong that we 
must abolish is the forced 
sale of goods. In future, no 
one shall sell goods. Vendors 
may only permit their customers to buy. 
2. The second wrong that 
we must abolish is Advertising. All billboards are to be 
ripped down at once. Magazines and newspapers will 
confine their paid notices to 
one quarter-inch per page, 
and these may not have illustrations. 
3. The third wrong that wc 
must abolish is the Commercial. Anybody who tries to use 
God’s free air time for pushing commodities offered for 
sale is an enemy of all the 
people, and has to be exiled 
to Antarctica. At least. 
Why, it was the very prescription 
for a Golden Age! That’s the way 
it was, and the way the people rejoiced was amazing. 
Except— well, there was the matter of the factories in the caverns. 
OR instance, there was a man 
named Cossett. His first name 
was Archibald, but you don’t have 
to bother remembering that part; 
his wife had a strong stomach, but 
that was more than she could put 
up with, and she mostly called him 
Bill. They had three kids — boys — 
named Chuck, Dan and Tommy, 
and Mrs. Cossett considered herself well off. 
One morning she told her husband so : “Bill, I love the way Honest Jack Tighe has fixed everything 
up for us! Remember how it was, 
Bill? Remember? And now, why — 
well, look. Don’t you notice anything?” 
“Hm?” inquired Cossett. 
“Your breakfast,” said Essie 
Cossett. “Don’t you like it?” 
Bill Cossett looked palely at his 
breakfast. Orange juice, toast, coffee. He sighed deeply. 
“Bill! I asked you if you liked it!” 
“I’m eating it, aren’t I? When did 
I ever have anything different?” 
“Never, honey,” his wife said 
gently. “You always have the same 
thing. But don’t you notice that the 
toast isn’t burned?” 
Cossett chewed a piece of it without emotion. “That’s nice,” he said. 
“And the coffee is fit to drink. 
And so’s the orange juice.” 
Cossett said irritably : “Essie, it’s 
great orange juice. It will be remembered.” 
Mrs. Cossett flared: “Bill, I can’t 
say a thing to you in the morning 
without your flying completely off 
the-” 
“Essie,” shouted her husband, “I 
had a bad night!” He glared at her, 
a good-looking man, still young, 
fine father and good provider, but 
at the end of his rope. “I didn’t 
sleep! Not a wink! I was awake all 
night, tossing and turning, tossing 
and turning, worrying, worrying, 
worrying. I’m sorry!” he cried, daring her to accept the apology. 
“But I only—” 
“Essie!” 
Mrs. Cossett was wounded to the 
quick. Her lip quivered. Her eyes 
moistened. Her husband, seeing the 
signs, accepted defeat. 
He sank back against his chair 
as she said meekly: “I only wanted 
to point out that it isn’t ruined. But 
you’re so touchy, Bill, that — I 
mean,” she said hurriedly, “do you 
remember what it was like in the 
old days, before Jack Tighe freed 
us all? When every month there 
was a new pop-up toaster, and 
sometimes you had to dial each 
slice separately for Perfect Custom 
Yumminess, and sometimes a red 
Magic Ruby Reddy-Eye did it for 
you? When the coffee maker you 
bought in June used coarse percolator coffee grind and the one you 
got to replace it in September took 
drip? 
“And now,” she cried radiantly, 
her momentary anger forgotten, 
“and now I’ve had the same appliances for more than six months! 
I’ve had time to learn to use them! 
I can keep them until they wear 
out! And when they’re gone, if I 
want I can get the exact same 
model again! Oh, Bill,” she wept, 
quite overcome, “how did we get 
along in the old days, before Jack 
Tighe?” 
Her husband pushed his chair 
back from the table and sat regarding her without a word for a long 
moment. 
Then he got up, reached for his 
hat, groaning, “Ah, who can eat?” 
and rushed out of the house to his 
place of business. 
The sign over his store read: 
A. COSSETT 8s CO. 
Authorized Buick Dealer 
He sobbed all the way down to 
the shop. 
Y OU musn’t feel too sorry for 
old Bill Cossett; there were a 
lot like him those days. But it was 
pretty sad, no doubt of it. 
When he got to the shop, he 
wanted to sob some more, but how 
could he, in front of the staff? One 
little break from him and all of 
them would have been wailing. 
As it was, his head salesman, 
Harry Bull, was in a dither. He was 
lighting one cigarette after another, 
taking a single abstracted puff and 
placing each of them neatly, side 
by side like spokes, along the rim 
of his big glass ashtray. He didn’t 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
know he was doing it, of course. His 
eyes were fixed emptily on the ashtray, all right, but what his glazed 
vision beheld were the smoldering 
ashes of hellfire. 
He looked up when his boss came 
in. 
“Chief,” he burst out tragically, 
“they’ve come in! The new models! 
I had the Springfield office on the 
phone a dozen times already this 
morning, I swear. But it’s the same 
answer every time.” 
Cossett took a deep breath. This 
was a time for manhood. He stuck 
his chin out proudly and said, his 
voice perfectly level : “They won’t 
cancel, then.” 
“They say they can’t,” said Harry 
Bull, and stared with a corpse’s 
eyes at the crowded showroom. 
“They say the caverns are raising 
all the quotas. Sixteen more cars,” 
he whispered dully, “and that’s just 
the Roadmasters, Chief. I didn’t 
tell you that part. Tomorrow we 
get the Specials and the Estate 
Wagons, and — and — 
“Mr. Cossett,” he wept, “the 
Estate Wagons are eleven inches 
longer this month! I can’t stand it!” 
he cried wildly. ‘We got eighteen 
hundred and forty-one cars piled 
up already! The floor’s full. The 
shop’s full. The top two floors are 
full. The lot’s full. We hauled all 
the trade-ins off to the junkyard 
yesterday and, even so, now we got 
them double-parked on both sides 
of the street for six blocks in every 
direction! You know, Chief, I 
couldn’t even get to the place this 
morning? I had to park at the corner of Grand and Sterling and walk 
the rest of the way, because I 
couldn’t get through!” 
For the first time, Cossett’s expression changed. “Grand and Sterling?” he repeated thoughtfully. 
“Yeah? I’ll have to try coming 
that way tomorrow.” Then he 
laughed, a bitter laugh. “One thing, 
Harry. Be glad we’re handling 
Buicks and not, you know, one of 
the Low-Priced Three. I came by 
Culex Motors yesterday, and— 
“By Godfrey,” he shouted suddenly, “I’m going to go down and 
talk to Manny Culex. Why not? It 
isn’t just our problem, Harry — it’s 
everybody’s. And maybe the whole 
industry ought to get together, just 
for once. We never did; nobody 
would start it. But things are getting to a point where somebody’s 
got to lead the way. Well, it’s 
going to be me! There just isn’t any 
sense letting the caverns turn out 
all these new cars after Jack Tighe 
has told the whole blasted country 
that they don’t have to buy them 
any more. Washington will do 
something. They’ll have to!” 
But all the way over to Manny 
Culex’s, past the carton-barricaded 
appliance stores, widely skirting 
the shambles that surrounded the 
five and ten, rolling up the windows 
as he threaded his way past the 
burst spoiled food cans at the superGALAXY 
market, Cossett couldn’t put one 
question out of his mind : 
Suppose they couldn’t? 
II 
TVF OW you mustn’t think Jack 
•*- ’ Tighe wasn’t right on top of 
this situation. He knew about it. 
Oh, yes! Because it wasn’t just 
Archibald Cossett and Manny 
Culex — it was every car dealer — 
and it wasn’t just the car dealers, 
but every merchant in Rantoul who 
sold goods to the public; and it 
wasn’t just Rantoul, but all of Illinois, all of the Middle West, all the 
country — and, yes, when you come 
right down to it, all of the world. (I 
mean all the inhabited world. Naturally there was no problem in, 
say, Lower Westchester.) 
Things were piling up. 
It was a matter of automation 
and salesmanship. In the big war, 
it had seemed like a good idea to 
automate the factories. Maybe it 
was— production was what counted 
then, all kinds of production. They 
certainly got the production, sure 
enough. Then, when the war was 
over, there was a method for handling the production — a method 
named advertising. But what did 
that mean, when you came to think 
it over? It meant that people had 
to be hounded into buying what 
they didn’t really want, with money 
they hadn’t yet earned. It meant 
pressure. It meant hypertension 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
and social embarrassment and 
competition and confusion. 
Well, Jack Tighe took care of 
that part, him and his famous Bill 
of Wrongs. 
Everybody agreed that things 
had been intolerable before — before, that is, Tighe and his heroic 
band had marched on the Pentagon and set us all free. The trouble 
was that now advertising had been 
abolished and nobody felt he had 
to buy the new models as they 
came out of the big automated 
plants in the underground caverns 
. and what were we going to do 
with the products? 
Jack Tighe felt that problem as 
keenly as any vacuum-cleaner 
salesman hard-selling a suburban 
neighborhood from door to door. 
He knew what the people wanted. 
And if he hadn’t, why, he would 
have found it pretty quickly, because the people, in their delegations and petitions, were taking 
every conceivable opportunity to 
let him know. 
For instance, there was the Midwest Motor Car Association’s delegation, led by Bill Cossett, his very 
own self. Cossett hadn’t wanted to 
be chairman, but he’d been the 
one to suggest it, and that usually 
carries a fixed penalty: “You 
thought it up? Okay. You make it 
go.” 
Jack Tighe received them in person. He listened with great courtesy and concern to their prepared 
speech; and that was unusual, because Tighe wasn't the relaxed old 
man who’d fished the Delaware 
south of Pung’s Corners for so 
many happy years. No, he was an 
irritable President now, and delegations were nothing in his life; he 
faced fifty of them a day. And they 
all wanted the same thing. Just let 
us push our product a little, please? 
Naturally, no other commodity 
should be privileged to violate the 
Bill of Wrongs — nobody wants the 
Age of Advertising back!— but, Mr. 
President, the jewelry findings 
game (or shoes, or drugs, or business machines, or frozen food, and 
so forth) is historically, intrinsically, dynamically and pre-eminently different, because . 
And, you’d be surprised, they all 
thought up reasons to follow the 
“because.” Some of the reasons 
were corkers. 
¥> UT Jack Tighe didn’t let them 
get quite as far as the reasons. 
He listened about a sentence and a 
half past the “nobody wants the 
Age of Advertising back” movement and into the broad largo that 
began the threnody of their unique 
troubles. And then he said, with a 
sudden impulse: “You there! The 
young fellow!” 
“Cossett! Good old Bill Cossett!” 
cried a dozen eager voices, as they 
pushed him forward. 
“I’m impressed,” said Jack Tighe 
thoughtfully, seizing him by the 
172 
hand. He had had an idea, and 
maybe it was time to act on it. “I 
like your looks, Gossop,” he said, 
“and I’m going to do something for 
you.” 
“You mean you’re going to let 
us ad— K began the eager voices. 
“Why, no,” said Jack Tighe, surprised. “Of course not. But I’m setting up a Committee of Activity to 
deal with this situation, gentlemen. 
Yes, indeed. You mustn’t think 
we’ve been idle here in Washington. 
And I’m going to put Artie Gossop 
— I mean Hassop — here on the 
Committee. There!” he said kindly, 
but proudly too. “And now,” he 
added, leaving through his private 
door, “good day to you all.” 
It was a signal honor, Bill Cossett thought, or anyway all the 
eager voices assured him that it 
was. 
But forty-eight hours later, he 
wasn’t so sure. 
The rest of the delegation had 
gone home. Why wouldn’t they? 
They had accomplished what they 
set out to do. The problem was 
being taken care of. 
But as for good old Bill Cossett, 
why, at that moment he was doing 
the actual taking care. 
And he didn’t like it. It turned 
out that this Committee of Activity 
was not merely to study and make 
recommendations. Oh, no. That 
wasn’t Jack Tighe’s way. The Commlittee was to do something. And 
for that reason, Cossett found him
self with a rifle in his hand, in an 
armored half track. He was part of 
a task force of heavy assault troops, 
staring down the inclined ramp 
that led to the cavern factory under 
Farmingdale, Long Island. 
L ET me tell you about Farmingdale. 
National Electro-Mech had its 
home office there — in the good old 
days, you know. Came the Cold 
War. The Board of Directors of 
National Electro-Mechanical Appliances, Inc., took a look at its balance sheet, smiled, thought of taxes, 
wept, and determined to plow a 
considerable part of its earnings 
into a new plant. 
It was to be not merely a new 
plant, but a fine plant — wasn’t the 
government paying for it anyhow, 
in a way? I mean what didn’t come 
off taxes as capital expansion came 
back as pay for proximity-fuse contracts. So they dug themselves a 
great big hole — a regular underground Levittown of the machine, 
so to speak — acres and acres of 
floor surface, and all of it hidden 
from the light of day. Okay, chuckled the Board of Directors, rubbing its hands, let them shoot their 
ICBMs! Yah, yah! Can’t touch me! 
That was during the Cold War. 
Well, then the Cold War hotted 
up, you know. The missiles flew. 
The Board got its orders from 
Washington, hurry-up orders: automate, mechanize, make it faster, 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
boost its size. They took a deep 
breath and gamely sent the engineers back to the drawing boards. 
The orders were to double production and make it independent 
of the outside world. The engineers whispered among themselves 
— “Are they kidding?" they asked 
— but they went to work, and as 
fast as the designs were approved, 
the construction machines went 
back to work to make them real. 
The digging machines chugged 
down into the factory bays again, 
expanding them, making concealed 
tunnels; and this time they were 
followed by concrete-and-armorplate layers, booby-trap setters, 
camoufleurs, counterattack planners. 
They hid that plant, friend. They 
concealed it from infra-red, ultraviolet and visual-wave spotting, 
from radar and sonic echo beams, 
from everything but the nose of a 
seeing-eye dog, and maybe even 
from that. 
They armored it. 
They fixed it so you couldn’t get 
near it, at least not alive. They 
armed it — with homing missiles, 
batteries of rapid-fire weappns, 
everything they could think of — 
and they had a lot of people thinking— that would discourage intruders. 
They automated it; not only 
would it make its products, but it 
would keep on making them as 
long as the raw materials held out 
— yes, and change the designs, too, 
because it is a basic part of industrial technology that planned obsolescence should be built into every 
unit. 
Yes, that was the idea. Without 
a man anywhere in sight, the cavern factories could build their products, change their designs, retool 
and bring out new ones. 
More than that. They set sales 
quotas, by direct electronic hookup with the master computer of 
the Bureau of the Census in Washington; they wrote on electric 
typewriters and printed on staticelectricity presses all the needed 
leaflets, brochures, instruction manuals and diagrams. 
Tricky problems were met with 
clever answers. For instance, argued one R&D V.P., “Won’t the 
factory have to have at least a 
couple of pretty girls to use as 
models for the leaflet illustrations?” 
“Nah,” said an engineer bluntly. 
“Look, Boss, here’s what we’ll do.” 
He drew a quick and complicated schematic. 
“I see,” said the V.P., his eyes 
glazing. 
Truthfully, he didn’t understand 
at all, but then they went ahead 
and built it and he saw that the 
thing worked. 
A memory-bank selector, informed of the need for a picture of 
a pretty girl operating, say, an electric egg-cooker, drew upon taped 
files of action studies of models for 
the girl they wanted in the pose the 
computers decreed. Another tape 
supplied appropriate clothing— anything from a parka to a Bikini 
(mostly it was Bikinis) — and an 
electronic patcher dubbed it in. A 
third file, filmed on the spot, produced the egg-cooker itself, dubbed 
in as large as life and twice as 
pretty. 
It worked. 
And then there was the problem 
of writing the manuals. 
It wasn’t so much the actual composition of the how-to-do directions. There was nothing hard 
about that; after all, the whole idea 
was that the consumer should be 
told how to operate the thing 
without his having to know what 
was under the chromium-plated 
shell. But — well, what about trademarked names? Some brain had to 
coin the likes of Kleen-Heet AutoTyme Hardboyler, or Shel-Krak 
Puncherator. 
r 1 1 HEY tried programming the 
computer to think that sort of 
thing up. The computer gulped, 
clucked and spewed out an assortment. The engineers looked at each 
other and scratched their heads. 
Kleen-Krak Boylerator? Eg-StaTik Clocker? 
Discouraged, they trailed with 
their reports to the V.P. 
“Boss,” they said, “maybe we 
better put this thing back on the 
drawing boards. These names the 
GALAXY 
machine came up with don’t make 
sense.” 
This time it was the V.P. who 
said bluntly: “Nah, don’t worry. 
Didn’t you ever hear of Hotpoint 
Refrigerators?” 
So merrily they went on, and the 
cavern factories were automated. 
Then, when the frantically 
dreaming engineers had them complete, they added one more touch. 
Electric percolators need steel, 
chromium, copper, plastics for the 
extension cord, plastics for the 
handle, a different sort of plastic 
yet for the ornamental knobs and 
embellishments. So they supplied 
them — not by stockpiles, no, for 
stockpiles can be used up, but by 
telling the vast computers that ran 
the plant where its raw materials 
might be found. 
They supplied National ElectroMech with a robot-armed computer that could sniff out its raw 
materials and direct diggers to the 
lodes. They added a fusion powerplant that would run as long as its 
supply of fuel held out (and its fuel 
was hydrogen, from the water of 
Long Island Sound or, if that went 
dry, from the waters bound in the 
clay, the silicate sand, the very 
bedrock underneath). 
Then they pushed the little red 
switch to “on,” stepped back — and 
ducked. 
Percolators came pouring out by 
the thousands that first day. 
Then the machines began to 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
speed up. Percolators flooded out 
by the tens of thousands. And then 
the machines settled down to full 
production. 
“Ahem,” coughed one of the engineers. “Say,” he said. “I wonder. 
That little red button. Suppose we 
wanted to turn it off. Could we?” 
Top management frowned. 
“Don’t you know there’s a war on?” 
they asked. “Production — that’s 
what counts. Then, when the war is 
won, we can worry about turning 
the fool thing off. Right now, we 
can’t take the risk that enemy 
agents might penetrate our defenses and cripple our war effort, so 
the button only works one way.” 
Then the war was won. And, 
yes, they could worry. 
Ill 
/"kN the ramp outside Farmingdale, Major Commaigne 
rattled into his microphone : “Korowicz! Back me up and watch for 
missiles. You’re air cover for the 
whole detachment. Bonfils, I want 
you on the road. Draw fire when 
the trucks come out, and then retire. Goodpastor, you cover the 
demolition crews. Gershenow, 
you’re our reserve. Watch it now. 
They’ll be coming out in a minute.” 
He clicked off his microphone 
switch and stared, sweating, at the 
ramp. 
Bill Cossett shifted nervously in 
his seat and looked at the rifle in 
his hand. It was a stripped-down 
rough-duty model, made to Jack 
Tighe’s personal specifications, and 
the only thing you had to remember was that when you pulled the 
trigger, it would go off. But rifles 
weren’t much a part of Cossett’s 
life. He caught himself thinking 
wretchedly how nice it would be to 
be back in Rantoul. Then he remembered those crowded blocks 
of unsold Buicks. 
Behind their halftrack, the four 
other vehicles of the party rattled 
into position. This ramp was one of 
eighteen that led from National 
Electro-Mech’s plant to the outside world. Along it, at carefully 
randomed intervals, huge armored 
trailer-trucks rumbled up, past six 
sets of iridium-steel gates, out into 
the open air and onto the highways. No driver manned these 
trucks. Their orders were stamped 
into their circuits in the underground loading bays. Each had a 
destination where its load of percolators and waffle irons was to go, 
and each had the means of getting 
it there. 
Bill Cossett coughed. “Major, 
why couldn’t we just shoot them 
up as they come out?” 
“They shoot back,” said Major 
Commaigne. 
“Yes, I know, but maybe we 
could use the same tactics. Automatic weapons. Let them fight it 
out — our robot guns against the 
trucks. Then—” 
“Mr. Cossett,” said the major 
wearily, “I’m glad to see you’re 
thinking. But believe me, we’ve all 
had those thoughts.” He gestured 
at the approaches to the ramp. 
“Look at those roads. You think 
there hasn’t been plenty of fighting 
there?” 
Cossett looked at the approaches 
and felt foolish. There was no 
doubt of it — every road for a mile 
around was tank-trenched, Cadmus-toothed, booby-trapped. Those 
were the first — and most obvious 
— measures the population had 
taken, in its early mob panic. But 
the trailer-trucks had been too 
smart for anything so simple. They 
had bridged the trenches, climbed 
the rows of dragon’s teeth, and exploded the land mines harmlessly 
against the drum-chains that ceaselessly pounded the roads ahead of 
them. 
“We had to stop,” the major 
brooded, “because it just wasn’t safe 
to live around here. The factories 
fight back, of course. The tougher 
we make it for them, the more ingenious their counterattacks and — 
Stations!” he blazed, thumbing 
down the microphone switch. 
“Here they come!” 
The scarred outer gate whined 
open. A monster peered hesitantly 
out. 
"IVT O brain — no organic brain, at 
1 ' least, only a maze of copper, 
tungsten, glass — was in it, but the 
GALAXY 
truck was eerily human as it tested 
the air, searched its surroundings, 
peered radar-eyed for possible enemies. The trucks learned. They 
knew. There was no circuit in their 
electronic intellects for wondering 
why, but their job was to get the 
merchandise delivered, and one of 
the sub-tasks in the job assignment 
was to clear the way of obstacles. 
The obstacle named Major 
Commaigne yelled: “Hold your 
fire!” 
Silently, their weapons hunted 
the vulnerable spots of axles and 
steering linkages on the trucks as 
they came out, but in each armored 
car, the gunners held down the interrupt buttons that kept the guns 
from going off. The trucks came 
lumbering out, flailing the roads, 
turrets wheeling to scan the terrain 
around. There were eight of them. 
Then: 
“Fire!” bawled Major Commaigne, and the battle was on. 
Bonfils, down the road, darted 
out of concealment and blasted the 
first trucks. There was no confusion, no hesitation, as the trucks 
regrouped and returned fire; but 
Bonfils had wasted no time either, 
and he was out of range in a matter 
of seconds. 
Korowicz added his fire as the 
first defensive missiles roared up. 
Gershenow caught two of the 
trucks trying to execute a flanking 
movement. It was a fine little fire 
fight. 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
But it wasn’t the main show. 
“Demolition teams in!” roared 
Commaigne, and Goodpastor’s halftrack bobbed up out of concealment and landed its mining experts 
at the lip of the ramp itself. The 
controlling machines had many 
circuits for directing simultaneous 
activities, but the number was not 
infinite. They had good reason to 
hope that with the active battle out 
on the road, the principal guardians 
of the factory might not be able to 
repel an attack on the entrance. 
Commaigne snapped down his 
gas helmet and said thickly, 
through the gagging canvas and 
plastic: “We’re next.” 
Bill Cossett nodded, licked his 
lips and put his own helmet on as 
their car circled the battle and 
headed for the ramp. Before they 
got there, the demolition team had 
blown off the first of the sets of 
gates. Thin gray-brown smoke still 
curled out, and already the demolition men were setting their 
charges for the second gate, twenty 
yards farther down. 
“Now,” said Major Commaigne, 
halting the halftrack and opening 
the hatch. “Be careful!” he warned, 
leading the detachment out, but it 
was hardly necessary. If they were 
all like himself, Bill Cossett 
thought, they were going to be 
careful indeed. 
They marched on the heels of 
the demolition team down into the 
automated factory. 
T T was noisy, and it was hot It 
was dark, or nearly, except for 
the lights of the demolition team 
and what they carried themselves. 
The blasted gates were clicking 
and buzzing petulantly, attempting 
to close themselves, aware that 
someone was coming through, and 
resenting it. 
Somebody yelled: “Watch it!” 
and, shwissh-poo, a tongue of liquid 
butane licked out across the ramp 
and puffed into flame. Everybody 
dropped — just in time. A smell of 
burning wool and a yowl from Major Commaigne showed how barely 
in time it had been. 
One of the enlisted men cried: 
“It’s onto us! Take cover!” 
But everybody had already, of 
course — as much as they could, not 
knowing just what constituted 
“cover” in a place that the machinebrain that ran the factory had had 
a solid decade to study and chart. 
One of the machine’s built-in 37millimeter auto-aimed guns sniffed 
the infra-red spectrum for body 
heat, found it, aimed and fired. 
“I’m corning, I’m coming,” yammered the shells — Vengo, vengo, 
vengo — but there were blind spots 
around the shattered gates, and the 
invading party crouched in shelter. 
Major Commaigne, hardly daring to raise his head, cried: “Everybody all right?” 
There wasn’t any answer, which 
meant either that everybody was 
indeed all right ... or dead, and 
178 
thus exempted from the necessity 
of answering at all. 
Deafened, sweltering, choking 
inside his anti-gas helmet, Bill Cossett swallowed hard and wished 
he’d kept his big mouth shut, back 
in Rantoul. What a committee to 
volunteer for! 
Major Commaigne’s combat 
boots kicked a pit in his kidneys as 
a .30 caliber machine-gun opened 
up, firing by pattern — twenty 
rounds at forty yards elevation and 
270 degrees azimuth, traverse two 
degrees and fire another burst, traverse again, fire again, endlessly. It 
was area fire. 
And it had one good feature. 
“They’ve lost us!” Major Commaigne gloated. 
The winking electronic brain inside the factory had lost sight of 
them — perhaps even thought they 
were disposed of — and was merely 
putting the finishing sterilizing 
touches on its disinfecting operation, in its meticulous machine 
fashion. 
But Bill Cossett wasn’t able to 
read that encouraging message out 
of the machine-gun fire. He didn’t 
have the faintest idea what Major 
Commaigne was talking about; all 
he was able to tell was that the 
ramp was suddenly lit with a flickering light of tracer rounds, and the 
smell of the ammunition stifled 
him, and the noise of the guns and 
the heterodyne squee of the ricochets was enough to deafen. Not 
to mention the fact that, with all 
that stuff flying around, a person 
could get hurt. 
"D UT Major Commaigne was 
ready for his sneak punch. He 
propped himself on an elbow, very 
cautiously, and peered down the 
tunnel to where the demolition 
crews were rigging a larger-thannormal charge. 
“Ready?” he shouted. 
One of the figures waved a hand. 
“Then fire!” he bawled, and the 
demolition men thrust down a 
plunger. 
Waroom. A corner of the wall at 
the remains of the shattered gate 
flew out and collapsed. 
Bill Cossett stared. Down from 
the surface was clanking a machine 
— an enemy? But Major Commaigne was waving it on. One of 
theirs then, but he had never seen 
it before; never seen anything like 
it, in fact. 
And that was not surprising. 
Out of heaven knows what incalculable resources, the Pentagon 
had produced a Winnie’s Pet. The 
story was that back in the old days 
Winston Churchill — yes, that long 
ago! — was fighting a war against 
Hitler, and Churchill decided that 
what he needed was a trench digger of heroic proportions. A big one, 
he dreamed, big enough so that in 
Flanders or at Soissons, it could 
have turned the tide of battle. 
And so his design staff produced 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
the Winnie’s Pet, a tunnel digger, 
huge in size. Well, maybe it would 
have turned the tide in 1917. But 
what war was ever fought in 
trenches again after that? 
The machine was still around, 
though, and on the spot, because 
that was Major Commaigne’s plan. 
He waved it on, into the breach in 
the armor-plating of the tunnel that 
his demolition crew had made. It 
was set for lateral tunneling. They 
gave it its head and followed it into 
a brand-new and therefore (presumably) unguarded tunnel that 
would parallel the ramp they were 
in, clear down to the factory itself. 
Bill Cossett got up and ran after 
Major Commaigne and the others, 
unbelieving. It was all too easy! 
Behind them, the clatter of gunfire 
dwindled. There were no guns here 
— how could there be? They were 
safe. 
Then — 
“Ouch!” yelped Major Commaigne, inadvertently touching the 
wall, for it was hot. Then he 
grinned at Cossett, his face shadowed in the light from their helmet 
lamps and the tunneler. “Scared 
me for a minute,” he said. “But it’s 
all right. It must be fused — from 
the digging, you know. But—” 
He stopped, thinking. 
And it was only right that he 
should think, because he was wrong. 
It couldn’t be atomic fusion that 
heated that wall. Why, Churchill 
didn’t have atomic fusion to play 
with back in 1940, when Winnie’s 
Pet was built! 
“Run!” shouted Major Commaigne. “You, there! Get out of that 
thing!” 
The crew hesitated, then spilled 
out of the digger, and again just in 
time. 
Because the heat had been 
atomic, all right, but the atoms 
were bursting at the command of 
the computer that ran the factory. 
Seismographs had detected the 
vibration of their tunneling; metal 
subterrene moles with warheads 
had been sent after them; as they 
raced out of the new tunnel at one 
end, the moles burst through at the 
other, struck the digger and exploded. 
They made it up the ramp and 
to their waiting halftracks, but just 
barely. 
And that was the end of Round 
One. If any referee in the world 
had been watching, I don’t care 
who or how biased in favor of the 
human race, he would have given 
that round to the machines. It was 
an easy win, no contest; and the 
detachment brooded about it all 
the way back to the Pentagon. 
IV 
V| !J ELL, they didn’t call him Un” lickable Jack Tighe for nothing. In fact, they didn’t call him 
Unlickable Jack at all then. That 
didn’t come until later, and that’s 
180 
another story. But already Tighe 
was demonstrating the qualities 
which made him great 
“There’s got to be a way,” he 
declared, and pounded the table. 
“There’s got to.” 
The Committee of Activity silently licked its wounds, staring at 
him. 
“Look, fellows,” Tighe said reasonably, “men built these machines. 
Men can make them stop!” 
Bill Cossett waited for somebody 
else to speak. Nobody did. “How, 
Mr. Tighe?” he asked, wishing he 
didn’t have to be the one to put the 
question. 
Tighe stared fretfully — and unansweringly — out of the Pentagon 
window. 
“You just tell us how,” Cossett 
went on, “because we don’t know. 
We can’t get in — we’ve tried that. 
We can’t blow up the goods as they 
come out — we’ve tried that too. 
We can’t cut off the power, because 
it’s completely self-contained. What 
does that leave? The computer has 
more resources than we have, that’s 
all.” 
“There’s always a way,” said 
obstinate Jack Tighe, and shifted 
restlessly in his leather chair. It 
was not that he wasn’t used to positions of responsibility, for hadn’t he 
been on the Plans Board of Yust 8s 
Ruminant? But running a whole 
country was another matter. 
Marlene Groshawk coughed 
apologetically. 
“Mr. Tighe, sir,” she said. (You 
know who Marlene Groshawk is. 
Everybody does.) 
Tighe said irritably: “Later, 
Marlene. Can’t you see this thing’s 
got me worried?” 
“But that’s what it’s about, Mr. 
Tighe,” she said, “sir. I mean it’s 
about this thing.” 
She put her glasses on her pretty 
nose and looked at her notes. She, 
too, had come a long way from her 
public-stenographer days at Pung’s 
Corners, and it wasn’t entirely an 
upward path. Though no doubt 
there was honor to being the private secretary of old Jack Tighe. 
She said: “I’ve got it all down 
here, Mr. Tighe, sir. You’ve tried 
brute force and you’ve tried subtlety. Well, what I ask myself is 
this: What would that wonderful, 
cute old TV detective Sherlock 
Holmes do?” 
She removed her glasses and 
stared thoughtfully around the 
room. 
M AJOR Comma igne burst out: 
“We could’ve been killed. 
But I don’t mind that, Mr. Tighe. 
What hurts is that we failed.” 
Marlene said : “So what I would 
suggest is—” 
“I can’t go home and face my 
wife,” Bill Cossett interrupted miserably. “Or all those Buicks.” 
“What Sher-” 
Jack Tighe growled: “We’ll lick 
it! Trust me, men. And now, unless 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
somebody else has a suggestion, I 
suppose we can adjourn this meeting. God knows we’ve accomplished 
nothing. But maybe sleeping on it 
will help. Any objections?” 
Marlene Groshawk stuck up her 
hand. “Mr. Tighe, sir?” 
“Eh? Marlene? Well, what is it?” 
She removed her glasses and 
looked at him piercingly. “Sherlock 
Holmes,” she said triumphantly. 
“He would have got in, because he 
would have disguised himself. 
There! Clear as the nose on your 
face, when you think of it, isn’t it?” 
Tighe took a deep breath. He 
shook his head and said, with more 
than ordinary patience: “Marlene, 
please stick to taking your shorthand. Leave the rest to us.” 
“But really, Mr. Tighe! Sir. I 
mean raw materials do get in, don’t 
they?” 
“Well?” 
“So suppose—” she said, cocking 
her head prettily, tapping her small 
white teeth with a pencil in a judgmatical way — “suppose you fellows disguised yourselves. As raw 
materials. And didn’t sneak in, but 
let the factory come and get you, so 
to speak. How about that?” 
Jack Tighe was a great and wise 
man, but he had a lot on his mind. 
He yelled: “Marlene, what’s the 
matter with you? That’s the craziest—” he hesitated — “the craziest 
thing I ever—” he coughed— “it’s the 
craziest . What do you mean, 
disguise themselves?” 
“I mean disguise themselves,” 
Marlene explained earnestly. “Like 
disguise. As raw materials.” 
Jack Tighe was silent for a second. 
Then he pounded his desk. “Love 
of heaven,” he cried, “I think she’s 
got it! Captain Margate! Where’s 
Captain Margate? You, Commaigne! Get out of here on the 
double and get me Captain Margate!” 
ID ILL COSSETT slipped quarters into the slot and waited 
for his wife in Rantoul to answer 
her phone. 
Her image took form in the 
screen, hair curlers and the baggy 
quilted robe she liked to slop 
around in. But she was still an attractive woman. “Bill? That you? 
But the operator said Farmingdale.” 
“That’s where I am, Essie. We, 
uh, we’re going to try something.” 
How did you say a thing like this 
without sounding heroic? It was 
hard, a fine line of distinction, for 
what he wanted was for his wife to 
think he was a hero, but not to 
think that he thought so too. “We’re 
going to, well, sneak into the cavern here.” 
“Sneak in?” Her voice became 
piercing. “Bill Cossett! Those factories are dangerous. You prorrv 
ised me you wouldn’t get in any 
trouble when I let you go east!” 
“Now, Essie,” he soothed. 
“Please, Essie. It’s going to be all 
right. I think.” 
“You think? Bill, tell me exactly 
what you’re up to!” 
“No I can’t!” he said, suddenly 
panicky, staring at the phone as 
though it were an enemy. “They’re 
all in it together, you see. The machines, I mean. I can’t say over the 
phone—” 
“Bill!” 
“But they are, Essie. We found 
that out. National Electro-Mech’s 
got a deep tunnel that goes clear to 
General Motors way out in Detroit, 
for trucks and so on. They get their 
computer parts from Philco in Philadelphia. How do I know the phone 
isn’t in on it too? No—” he interrupted her as she was about to demand the truth — “please, Essie. 
Don’t ask me. How are the kids? 
Chuck?” 
“Skinned knee. But, Bill, you 
mustn’t—” 
“And Dan?” 
“The doctor says it’s only a little 
allergy. But I’m not going to—” 
“And Tommy?” 
She frowned. “I spanked him fifty 
times yesterday,” she said, an exaggeration, certainly, but at least 
she was diverted from asking questions; she gave a concise catalogue 
of smashed dishes, spilled milk, unhung jackets and lost shoes; and 
Bill breathed again. 
For what he told her had been 
the truth; he was suddenly deathly 
afraid that the automatic long-lines 
GALAXY 
dialing apparatus of the phone company might have been infiltrated 
by its electronic brethren in the 
factories. There was no sense in 
telling the enemy what you were 
about to do! 
He managed to hang up without 
revealing his secret, and walked out 
of the booth to Major Commaigne’s 
command post. 
Heroes come in many forms, but 
it had never before occurred to A. 
Cossett, Authorized Buick Dealer, 
that a motor-car franchise holder, 
like a general, must sometimes offer his life in battle. 
r I ^ HE command post was busy, 
■*- but that was natural enough, 
for this was a project to which the' 
entire resources of the United 
States of America could well have 
been devoted. 
And the effort was beginning to 
show results. Bill Cossett came to a 
scene of excitement. Major Commaigne was listening to an excited 
Captain Margate, while the rest of 
the detachment stood by. 
Margate, as Bill Cossett had 
come to know, was Jack Tighe’s 
personal expert in raw materials 
and the like. A good man, Cossett 
thought. And so was Major Commaigne, a can-do kind of guy. And 
this Marlene Groshawk who was 
tagging along— well, Essie wouldn’t 
like that. But it was in line of duty. 
And, you know, kind of fun. 
Hastily, Bill Cossett shifted his 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
thoughts back to the problem of 
getting into National Electro
Mech. 
“Found it!” Captain Margate 
was crying, delighted. “We really 
found it! Geologists thought,” he 
said, shaking his head in wonder, 
“that there wasn’t any coal under 
Long Island, but trust the machines. They knew. We found it.” 
“Coal?” said Major Commaigne, 
his brows crinkling. 
“Why, yes, Major,” nodded the 
captain. “Coal. Raw materials, for 
your disguise.” 
“Disguise?” repeated Major 
Commaigne. 
“That’s right, Major.” 
“As lumps of coal?" 
The captain shrugged cheerfully. 
“As organic matter,” he clarified. 
“The machine, after all, won’t 
mind. Coal is carbon — hydrocarbons— oh, you’re close enough. The 
machine won’t mind a few little 
eccentricities. Why,” he went on, 
warming up, “the machine would 
still accept you even if you were a 
lot more impure than any of you 
really are.” 
Marlene Groshawk stamped her 
pretty foot. “Captain!” 
“I mean in a chemical way, Miss 
Groshawk,” the captain said humbly, and began to prepare their disguises. 
Bill Cossett tugged at his collar. 
“Captain Margate,” he said, “one 
thing. Suppose the factory catches 
us.” 
“It will, Mr. Cossett! That’s the 
whole idea.” 
“I mean suppose it finds out 
we’re not coal.” 
Captain Margate looked up 
thoughtfully from his pot of lampblack and cold cream. 
“That,” he said meditatively, 
“would be embarrassing. I don’t 
know what would happen exactly, 
but — ” He shrugged. “Still, it’s not 
the worst thing that could happen,” 
he added without worry. “It might 
be a whole lot worse if it never 
does find out you’re not raw materials.” 
“You mean—” gasped Marlene. 
“We’d be-” 
Captain Margate nodded. “You’d 
be processed. And,” he added gallantly, “you would make a very 
nice batch of plastic, Miss Groshawk.” 
V 
T T was a most trying time for all 
of them, you may be very sure. 
But they were brave enough. 
Major Commaigne let himself 
be smeared a sooty black without 
a flicker of his steel-gray eye or a 
quiver of his iron jaw. 
Bill Cossett tried desperately to 
remember how awful things were 
back in Rantoul — “Yes, yes,” he 
whispered frantically to himself, 
“even more awful than this.” 
Marlene Groshawk — well, you 
couldn’t tell much from her expres184 
sion. But she wrote later, in her 
memoirs, that she was really anxious about only one thing: How she 
would ever get all that stuff off? 
Sappers had tunneled them a 
neat little hole into a bed of brownish gassy coal. “Ssh!” hissed Captain Margate, a finger to his lips. 
“Listen.” 
In the silence, there was a distant chomp, chomp, chomp, like a 
great far-off inchworm nibbling his 
way through armor-plate. 
“The factory,” the captain whispered. “We’ll leave you now. Keep 
very still. Oh, and there are sandwiches and drinking water in that 
hamper. I don’t know how long 
you’ll have to wait” 
And the captain and the sappers 
withdrew up the shaft. 
Seconds later, a small explosive 
blast dumped the ceiling of the 
tunnel in, blocking it. The captain 
had warned them he would have to 
do that— “Don’t want to make the 
factory suspicious, you know!”— but 
it was like that first clod of soil falling on the coffin of the living entombed man, all the same. 
Time passed. 
They ate the sandwiches and 
drank the water. 
Time passed. 
They began to get hungry again, 
but there wasn’t anything to do 
about it, not any more. They 
couldn’t even call the whole thing 
off now, because there wasn’t any 
way to accomplish it. The distant 
GALAXY 
chomp, chomp was closer, true, but 
the darkness was closing in on 
them; the enforced silence was getting on their nerves; and the sulphury smell of the low-grade coal 
was giving Bill Cossett a splitting 
headache . 
And then it happened. 
Chomp, chomp. And a rattle, 
bang. And something broke through 
the coal shell around them with a 
splash of violet light. Stainless steel 
teeth, half a yard long, nibbled a 
neat circle out of the wall, swallowed, hiccoughed and inched forward. 
“Duck,” whispered Major Commaigne in the girl’s ear and, “Out 
of the way!” into Cossetfs, though 
whispering was hardly needful in 
the metallic clangor around them. 
They crouched aside and the teeth 
gnawed past them, a yard a minute, 
trenching the floor of their little 
cavern and spewing the crushed 
coal onto a wide conveyor belt that 
followed the questing jaws. 
“Jump!” murmured Commaigne 
when the teeth were safely by, and 
the three of them leaped onto the 
belt, nestled in shaking beds of coal 
fragments, borne upward and back 
toward the factory itself. 
They lay quiet, hardly breathing, 
against what unknown spy-eyes or 
listening devices the factory might 
employ. But if there were such, 
they missed their mark, or the 
strategy worked. At a steady crawling pace, they were drawn upward 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
and into the growing din of National Electro-Mech’s main plant 
It was as easy as that. 
Getting in was. But that was, of 
course, only the beginning. 
HEN National Electro-Mech 
™ put its factory under the sod 
of Farmingdale, the UERMWA, 
Local 606, had torn up the old contract and employed its best dreamers to invent a new one. 
“Year-round temperature of 
71.5°,” said Clause 14a. “Not less 
than 40 cu. ft. of pure, fresh, filtered 
air per worker per minute,” said 
Paragraph 9. “Lighting to be controlled by individual worker at his 
discretion,” said Sub-Section XII. 
It was underground, right enough, 
but it was very nice indeed. Why, 
they even had trouble, serious 
trouble, with one worker in ten 
refusing to go home even to sleep, 
especially during the hay-fever 
season. 
But that was before automation 
had set in. 
Now things were not nice at all, 
at least by human standards. Machines might have loved it, but — 
Well, the lights, to begin with, 
were hardly the pleasant, glarefree 
fluorescents that Local 606 had had 
in mind. Why should they be? Human eyes relish the visible spectrum, but machines see by photoelectric cells, and photocells see as 
well by red or even infra-red . 
which is cheap to generate and 
produces a satisfactory length of 
filament life. Consequently National Electro-Mech was now 
washed with a hideous ochre gloom. 
The air — ah, that was a laugh. 
Whatever air the departing human 
workers chanced to leave behind 
was still there, for machines don’t 
breathe. And the temperature was 
whatever it happened to be. In the 
remote ends of the galleries, it was 
chilly cold; in the area around the 
cookers, it was appalling. 
And the noise! 
Cringing, the three invaders 
gaped deafenedly around as they 
rode in on the conveyor belt. Bill 
Cossett stared through the bloodred gloom at a row of enormous 
stainless-steel spheres. He wondered what they were, and only 
glanced away in scant time to fling 
himself off the conveyor belt and 
yell: “Jump!” 
The others obeyed just as the 
lumps of coal they had been traveling with thumped with a roar and 
suffocating dust into a huge hopper. 
Beads of sweat broke out over 
them all. That coal was ultimately 
to be polymerized in the huge steel 
cookers Cossett had been staring 
at. The factory had not, of course, 
bothered to sweep away the excess 
heat with blowers. Why should it? 
But it wasn’t only the heat that 
brought out the sweat; they could 
hear the coal being powdered and 
whooshed away. 
They got out of there, holding 
186 
hands to keep together, tripping 
and stumbling in the bloody dusk. 
“Watch it!” bawled the major in 
Cossett’s ear, and Cossett ducked 
one horrifying instant before something huge and glittering swooped 
by his ear. 
This was, after all, an appliance 
factory, and Cossett couldn’t help 
thinking that a factory should 
have certain recognizable features. 
Aisles, for example, between the 
machines. 
But the cavern factory didn’t 
need aisles. Most factory traffic is 
in the changing of the shifts, the 
to-and-fro traffic of the coffee 
break, the casual promenade to the 
powder room or water cooler. None 
of these phenomena occurred in 
the manless caverns. Therefore the 
machine-mind had ended corridors 
and abolished aisles. It dumped jigs 
and bobbins where they were most 
convenient — to a machine, not to 
a man. The movement of fresh 
parts and the carting away of finished assemblies was done by overhead trolleys. 
As Cossett blinked after the one 
that had nearly whacked him, he 
caught glimpse of another shadow 
out of the corner of his eyes. 
“Watch it!” he yelled, and 
grabbed Marlene slipperily by the 
neck as a pod of toasters swept by. 
They all dropped to the littered 
floor and got up, swearing — except 
that Marlene didn’t swear. She was 
much too ladylike; that is, in that 
GALAXY 
IT# 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
way. But she said. “We ought to do 
our job and get out of here.” 
They looked at each other, a 
pathetic trio, smeared with grease 
and soot They were lost in a howling, hammering catacomb. They 
were unarmed and helpless against 
a smart and powerful factory of 
machines and weapons. 
“This was a dopy idea from the 
beginning,” moaned Cossett. “We’ll 
never get out.” 
“Never,” agreed the major, 
daunted at last. 
“Never,” nodded Marlene, and 
paused, frowning prettily in the 
gloom. “Unless we get thrown up,” 
she added. 
“You mean thrown out,” Cossett 
corrected. 
Marlene shook her head. “I mean 
upchucked,” she said in a refined 
manner, “like when you have an 
upset stomach.” 
' 1 1 HE two men looked at each 
other. 
“The place does eat, in a way,” 
said Cossett. 
“It’s a mistake to be teleological,” 
Commaigne objected. 
“But it does eat.” 
“Let’s think it out,” said Major 
Commaigne authoritatively, hitting 
the dirt to avoid a passing coil of 
extension cords. “Suppose,” he 
called up to the others, “we blow up 
the conveyor belt and those cookers. This will undoubtedly interfere 
with the logistics of the command
apparatus, right? It will then certainly try to find out what happened, and will, we must assume, 
discover that certain alien entities 
— ourselves, that is — found their 
way in through the raw-material 
receptors. Well, then! What is there 
for the thing to do but close down 
its receptors? And when it has done 
so, it will be cut off from the things 
it needs to continue manufacturing. 
Consequently, we may take as provisionally established, it will be 
unable — what?” 
Bill Cossett, bawling at him from 
under a parts table where he had 
taken refuge, repeated: “I said, 
where’s Marlene?” 
The major clambered to his 
knees. The girl was gone. In the 
dull, clattering, crashing gloom, 
strange shapes moved wildly about, 
but none of them seemed to be 
Marlene. She was gone and, the 
major suddenly discovered, something was gone with her — the bag 
of explosives. 
“Marlene!” screamed the two 
men. 
And, though it was only chance, 
she at once appeared. 
“Where have you been?” the major demanded. “What were you 
doing?” 
The girl stood looking down at 
them for a second. 
“I think we’d better get out of 
the way,” she said at last. “I took 
the bombs. I think I’ve given the 
thing a tummy-ache.” 
They had gone less than a dozen 
yards when the first of the little 
bombs went off, with a sodiumyellow glare and a firecracker bang; 
but it knocked a hundred yards of 
conveyor belt off the track. 
And then the fun really began... 
Less than an hour later, they 
were back on the surface, watching 
plumes of smoke trickle from fifty 
concealed ventilators scattered 
across the plain outside Farmingdale. 
Jack Tighe was delighted. “You 
clobbered it!” he gloated. “And it 
let you get out?” 
“Kicked us out,” exulted the major. “We were in the raw-materials 
area, you know. As far as I can tell, 
the factory has closed down the 
raw-materials operation entirely. It 
swept everything off what was left 
of the conveyor belt, us included— 
believe me, we had to step pretty 
quick to keep from getting hurt! 
Then it plugged up the belt tunnel, 
and as we were getting away, I saw 
a handling machine beginning to 
put armor-plate over the plug.” 
Jack Tighe howled: “We’ve 
licked it! Tell you what,” he said 
suddenly, “let’s give it a real bellyache. Plant a few more bombs in 
the coal beds to make sure . .” 
And they did but, really, it 
didn’t seem quite necessary; the 
cavern factory had withdrawn com*pletely within itself. No further attempts were made to get raw materials, then or ever. 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
In the next few days, while 
Tighe’s men tried the same tactic 
on factory after factory, all across 
the face of the continent — and always with the same success — the 
armed guards outside National 
Electro-Mech’s plant had very little 
to do. The factory wasn’t quite 
dead, no. Twice the first day, occasionally in the days that followed, 
a single furtive truck would come 
dodging out of the exit ramps. But 
only one truck, where there had 
been scores; and that one only 
partly loaded, and an easy target 
for the guards. 
It was victory. 
There was no doubt about it. 
Jack Tighe called for a day of 
national rejoicing. 
VI 
Vjl^HAT a feast it was! What a 
* ’ celebration! 
Jack Tighe was glowing with 
triumph and with joy. He was old 
and stern and powerful, but his 
hawk’s face was the face of a delighted boy. 
“Eat, my friends,” he boomed, 
his voice rolling through the amplifiers. “Enjoy yourselves! A new day 
has dawned for all of us, and here 
are the glorious three who made it 
possible!” 
He swept a generous arm toward 
those who sat beside him on the 
dais. Applause thundered. 
The three heroes were all there. 
Major Commaigne sat erect, tunic 
crisp, buttons gleaming, a bright 
new scarlet ribbon over all the 
other ribbons on his chest, where 
Jack Tighe had impulsively created a new decoration on the spot. 
Marlene Groshawk sat beside him, 
radiant. Bill Cossett was stiff, grin190 
ning uncomfortably as he sat next 
to his wife (who was staring thoughtfully at Marlene Groshawk). 
Jack Tighe bawled: “Eat, while 
the Marine Band plays us a march! 
And then we will have a few words 
from the heroes who have saved us 
all!” 
It was a glorious picnic. Hail to 
the Chief bounced brassily off the 
bright blue sky. Cossett sat miserably, no longer stiff, wondering 
what the devil he would find to say, 
when he noticed that the brassy 
bugles of the Marine Corps Band 
faded ringingly away. 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
A uniformed officer had dashed 
breathlessly through the crowd to 
the rostrum. He was whispering up 
to Jack Tighe, a look of tense excitement on his face. 
After a moment, Tighe stood 
up, hands raised, a smile on his 
face. 
“There’s nothing to worry about, 
friends,” he called, “nothing at all! 
But there’s a little life in the cavern 
factory yet. The colonel here tells 
me that another truck is coming 
out of the ramp, that’s all. So please 
just stay where you are and watch 
our boys knock it off!” 
P ANIC? No, there wasn’t any 
panic— why should the crowd 
have panicked? It was a kind of 
circus, an extra added attraction, 
as risk-free as the bear-baiting at 
a Sussex village fair. 
Let the obstinate old factory send 
its trucks out, thought the assembled thousands with a joy of anticipation, it’ll be fun to watch our 
boys smash them up! And it surely 
can’t mean anything. The battle is 
won. The factories can go on plotting underground as long as they 
like, but you can’t make toasters 
without copper and steel, and there 
hasn’t been any of that going in 
for weeks. No, pure fun, that’s all it 
is! 
And so they took advantage of 
the spectacle, climbing on chairs 
to see better, the fathers lifting the 
youngest to their shoulders. And 
the truck came whooping out. 
Rattle, rattle, the machine-guns 
roared. Wush went the rocket 
launchers. The truck didn’t have a 
chance. In convoys, in the old days, 
a few always got through; but here 
was only one, and it got clobbered 
for fair. 
Bill Cossett, hand in hand with 
his wife, went over to look at the 
smoldering ruins. The crowd fell 
back respectfully. 
Essie Cossett said gladly : “Serves 
them right! Those darn machines, 
they think they own us. I just wish 
I could get down there to watch 
them starving and suffering, like 
Mr. Tighe said. What are those 
things, dear?” 
Cossett said absently: “What 
things?” His attention was fixed on 
what the bazooka charge had done 
to the truck’s armored radiator 
grill, and he was thinking of how 
handily a rocket launcher belonging to the factory might have done 
the same to him. 
“Those shiny things.” 
“What shiny — Oh.” In the yawning flank of the truck, its steel plates 
sprung by half a dozen shells, a 
sort of metallic crate hung its edge 
over the lip of the hole. It was 
stenciled: 
NATIONAL 
Electro-Mech Appliances 
IV2 Gross Cigarette Lighters 
And from a dangling flap of the 
crate, small, shiny globules were 
oozing out— dripping out, but it was 
odd, because the confounded things 
were dripping up. They squeezed 
out like water from a leaky tap, 
bright, striated things, and, plop, 
they were free and floated away. 
“Funny,” said Bill Cossett to his 
GALAXY 
wife, vaguely apprehensive. “But it 
can’t be anything to worry about. 
Cigarette lighters! I never saw any 
like that.” 
Wonderingly he took his own 
cigarette case-and-lighter combination from his pocket 
He opened it. 
He held it in his hand to read 
the name stamped on the bottom, 
to see if by chance it was a National Electro-Mech. 
Pflut. One of the shiny things 
swooped down on him, danced 
above the case, came toward his 
face. He felt a harsh, urgent thrusting at his lips, ducked, coughed, 
choked, nearly strangled. 
C OSSETT scrambled to his feet, 
tore the cigarette out of his 
mouth, looked at it, threw it to the 
ground. 
“Good God!” he cried. “But how 
can they? We closed them down!” 
And all over the enormous crowd, 
others were making the same discovery, and the same error of deduction. From a smashed crate 
labeled Perc-o-Matics, 8-Cup, a 
shimmering series of little globes 
of light was whisking its way out 
into the air and around the crowd. 
Coffee makers? Yes, they were 
coffee makers. 
“Help!” yelled a woman whose 
jug of icewater was snatched out 
of her hands; and “Stop!” shrilled 
another, attempting to open a can 
of Maxwell House. 
THE WAGING OF THE PEACE 
Coffee grounds and water swam 
around in the air, like the jets at 
Versailles drowning the brown 
sands of Coney Island. Then the 
soggy used grounds neatly burrowed into the ground out of sight 
and the shimmering globe towed a 
sphere twice larger than itself from 
cup to cup, dispensing perfect coffee every time. 
A four-year-old, watching with 
his mouth agape, absently let his 
ham sandwich dangle. “Ouch!” he 
yelled, rubbing suddenly reddened 
fingers as another little sphere, this 
one emerald green, took the bread 
from his hand, toasted it a golden 
brown, expertly caught the falling 
ham and restored it to him before 
the ham had a chance to touch the 
ground. 
“Bill!” shrieked Essie Cossett. 
“What is this? I thought you 
stopped the factory.” 
“I thought so too,” muttered her 
husband blankly, watching the 
frightened crowd with eyes bright 
with horror. 
“But didn’t you cut off their raw 
materials? Isn’t that how you 
stopped it?” 
Bill Cossett sighed. “We cut off 
the raw materials,” he admitted. 
“But evidently that won’t stop the 
factories. They’re learning to do 
without. Force fields, magnetic flux 
—I don’t know! But that truck was 
full of appliances that didn’t use 
any raw materials at all!” 
He licked dry lips. “And that’s 
not the worst part of it,” he said, 
so softly that his wife could hardly 
hear. “I can face it if the bad old 
days come back again. I can stand 
it if every three months a whole 
new model comes out, and we have 
to sell, sell, sell and buy, buy, buy. 
But
“But these things,” he said sickly, 
“don’t look as though they’ll ever 
wear out. How can they? They 
aren’t made of matter at all! And 
when the new models keep coming 
out — how are we ever going to get 
rid of the old ones?”

FORECAST 
Next issue (dated October, and we'll explain that down below) assembles another great cargo of reading that Galaxy now carries — “Such a 
tome!" exclaims Mrs. Howard N. Bowman, Port Alsworth, Alaska, winning 
the brevity award — in the following seaworthy fashion: 
Up forward is a big novella, SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME by 
Christopher Grimm, Orientally devious in plot, up-to-tomorrow in ideas and 
backgrounds. Its hero is uncompromisingly villainous, its villain heroic and 
with a heart of gold, its heroine a strumpet with a heart of brass, its dross is 
treasure and its treasure dross, and much of it takes place in anything but a 
place — and if you can beat these and other puzzles to the finish line, you 
have an even wickeder mind than its author's. 
Amidships and astern are two novelets, WAY UP YONDER by Charles 
Satterfield and SILENCE by John Brunner, and possibly more than two. The 
first is a rousing romp, the second a breath-catching suspense story. 
Placed strategically for ballast — and quick reading for brief breaks 
— are several short stories, and our regular features, and a four-compartment article by Willy Ley, one compartment being about an accident that 
would have changed recent history if it had ever happened, another on the 
only non-animal that has become extinct since prehistoric times. 
Starting with the next issue, Galaxy will be clad more durably. Sorry it 
took so long to work off our supply of cover stock, but it's gone now and our 
armorplate will be much more in keeping with the oversize of the magazine. 
About the October dateline: Most newsstand dealers check their shelves 
at the beginning of each month — and send back all magazines dated that 
month! To avoid being taken off sale prematurely, we have to date a month 
ahead of our off-sale date. An annoying trade practice, but we can't buck it. 
About dropping “Science Fiction" from the title — we always intended to 
establish Galaxy as a science fiction magazine, then drop the term because 
it scares many away from buying — but not, as you've noted, changing the 
magazine itself.
