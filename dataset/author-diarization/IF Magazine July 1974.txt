This is a story of the future 
and the past. As for the present . 



MIDNIGHT BY THE 
MORPHY WATCH 

B eing World’s Chess Champion prime example enthroned right 
(crowned or uncrowned), puts a now. For more than ten years the 
more deadly and maddening strain present champion was clearly the 
on a man even than being President greatest chess player in the world, 
of the United States. We have a but during that time he exhibited 



6 




such willful and seemingly self-de- 
structive behavior — refusing to 

enter crucial tournaments, quitting 
them for crankish reasons while 
holding a commanding lead, enter- 
taining what many called a para- 
noid delusion that the whole world 
was plotting to keep him from 
reaching the top — that many in- 
formed experts wrote him off as a 
contender for the highest honors. 
Even his staunchest supporters ex- 
perienced agonizing doubts — until 
he finally silenced his foes and su- 
premely satisfied his friends by 
decisively winning the crucial and 
ultimate match on a fantastic polar 
island. 

Even minor players bitten by the 
world’s-championship bug — or the 
fantasy of it — experience a bit of 
that terrible strain, occasionally in 
very strange and even eerie 
fashion . 

S tirf Ritter-Rebil was indulging 
in one of his numerous creative 
avocations — wandering at random 
through his beloved downtown San 
Francisco with its sometimes dizzily 
slanting sidewalks, its elusive 
narrow courts and alleys, and its 
kaleidescope of ever-changing store 
and restaurant-fronts amongst the 
ones that persist as landmarks. To 
divert his gaze, there were interest- 
ing almond and black faces among 
the paler ones. There was the dan- 
gerous surge of traffic threatening 
to invade the humpy sidewalks. 
The sky was a careless silvery 



gray, like an expensive whore’s 
mink coat covering bizarre garb or 
nakedness. There were even wisps 
of fog, that Ray Area benizon. 
There were bankers and hippies, 
con men and corporation men, 
queers of all varieties, beggars and 
sports, murderers and saints (at 
least in Ritter’s freewheeling imagi- 
nation). And there were certainly 
alluring girls aplenty in an astound- 
ing variety of packages — and pretty 
girls are the essential spice in any 
really tasty ragout of people. In fact 
there may well have been Martians 
and time travelers. 

Ritter’s ramble had taken on an 
even more dreamlike, whimsical 
and unpredictable quality than 
usual — with an unflagging antici- 
pation of mystery, surprise, and 
erotic or diamond-studded adven- 
ture around the very next corner. 

He frequently thought of himself 
by his middle name, Ritter, be- 
cause he was a sporadically ardent 
chess player now in the midst of a 
sporad. In German “Ritter” means 
“knight,” yet Germans do not call 
a knight a Ritter, but a springer, or 
jumper (for its crookedly hopping 
move), a matter for inexhaustible 
philological, historical, and socio- 
racial speculation. Ritter was also a 
deeply devoted student of the his- 
tory of chess, both in its serious and 
anecdotal aspects. 

He was a tall, white-haired man, 
rather thin, saved from the look of 
mere age by ravaged handsome- 
ness, an altogether youthful though 



7 




worldly and symathetically cynical 
curiosity in his gaze (when he 
wasn’t daydreaming), and a defi- 
nitely though unobtrusively thea- 
trical carriage. 

He was more daydreamingly lost 
than usual on this particular 
ramble, though vividly aware of all 
sorts of floating, freakish, beautiful 
and grotesque novelties about him. 
Later he recollected that he must 
have been fairly near Portsmouth 
Square and not terribly far from 
the intersection of California and 
Montgomery. At all events, he was 
fascinatedly looking into the display 
window of a secondhand store he’d 
never recalled seeing before. It 
must be a new place, for he knew 
all the stores in the area, yet it had 
the dust and dinginess of an old 
place — its owner must have moved 
in without refurbishing the prem- 
ises or even cleaning them up. And 
it had a delightful range of items 
for sale, from genuine antiques to 
mod facsimiles of same. He noted 
in his first scanning glance, and 
with growing delight, a Civil War 
saber, a standard promotional rep- 
lica of the starship Enterprise \ a 
brand-new deck of tarots, an au- 
thentic shrunken head like a black 
globule of detritus from a giant’s 
nostril, some fancy roach-clips, a 
silver lusterware creamer, a Sony 
tape recorder, a last year’s whiskey 
jug in the form of a cable car, a 
scatter of Gene McCarthy and 
Nixon buttons, a single brass Lucas 
“King of the Road’’ headlamp 



from a Silver Ghost Rolls Royce, an 
electric toothbrush, a 1920’s radio, 
a last month’s copy of the Phoenix , 
and three dime-a-dozen plastic 
chess sets. 



and then, suddenly, all these were 
wiped from his mind. Unnotic- 
ed were the distant foghorns, the 
complaining prowl of slowed traffic, 
the shards of human speech behind 
him mosiacked with the singsong 
chatter of Chinatown, the reflection 
in the plate glass of a girl in a 
grandmother dress selling flowers, 
and of opening umbrellas as drops 
of rain began to sprinkle from the 
mist. For every atom of Stirf Ritter- 
Rebil’s awareness was burningly 
concentrated on a small figure 
seeking anonymity among the ran- 
domly set-out chessmen of one of 
the plastic sets. It was a squat, tar- 
nished silver chess pawn in the 
form of a barbarian warrior. Ritter 
knew it was a chess pawn — and 
what’s more, he knew to what fabu- 
lous historic set it belonged, be- 
cause he had seen one of its mates 
in a rare police photograph given 
him by a Portuguese chess-playing 
acquaintance. He knew that he had 
quite without warning arrived at a 
once-in-a-lifetime experience. 

Heart pounding but face a suave 
mask, he drifted into the store’s in- 
terior. In situations like this it was 
all-essential not to let the seller 
know what you were interested in or 
even that you were interested at all.

IF 




The shadowy interior of the place 
lived up to its display window. 
There was the same piquant clutter 
of dusty memorables and among 
them several glass cases housing 
presumably choicer items, behind 
one of which stood a gaunt yet 
stocky elderly man whom Ritter 
sensed was the proprietor, but pre- 
tended not even to notice. 

But his mind was so concen- 
trated on the tarnished silver pawn 
he must possess that it was a stupe- 
fying surprise when his automati- 
cally flitting gaze stopped at a 
second and even greater once-in-a- 
lifetime item in the glass case 
behind which the proprietor stood. 
It was a dingy, old-fashioned gold 
pocket watch with the hours not in 
Roman numerals as they should 
have been in so venerable a time- 
piece, but in the form of dull gold 
and silver chess pieces as depicted 
in game-diagrams. Attached to the 
watch by a bit of thread was a slim, 
hexagonal gold key. 

Ritter’s mind almost froze with 
excitement. Here was the big 
brother of the skulking barbarian 
pawn. Here, its true value almost 
certainly unknown to its owner, was 
one of the supreme rarities of the 
world of chess-memorabilia. Here 
was no less than the gold watch 
Paul Morphy, meteorically short- 
reigned King of American chess, 
had been given by an adoring 
public in New York City on May 
25, 1859, after the triumphal tour 
of London and Paris which had 



proven him to be perhaps the great- 
est chess genius of all time. 

Ritter veered as if by lazy chance 
toward the case, his eyes resolutely 
fixed on a dull silver ankh at the 
opposite end from the chess watch. 

He paused like a sleepwalker 
across from. the proprietor after 
what seemed like a suitable interval 
and — hoping the pounding of his 
heart wasn’t audible — made a de- 
sultory inquiry about the ankh. The 
proprietor replied in as casual a 
fashion, though getting the item 
out for his inspection. 

Ritter brooded over the silver 
love-cross for a bit, then shook his 
head and idly asked about another 
item and still another, working his 
insidious way toward the Morphy 
watch. 

The proprietor responded to his 
queries in a low, bored voice, 
though in each case dutifully 
getting the item out to show Ritter. 
He was a very old and completely 
bald man with a craggy Baltic cast 
to his features. He vaguely remind- 
ed Ritter of someone. 

Finally Ritter was asking about 
an old silver railroad watch next to 
the one he still refused to look at 
directly. 

Then he shifted to another old 
watch with a complicated face with 
tiny windows showing the month 
and the phases of the moon, on the 
other side of the one that was keep- 
ing his heart a-pound. 

His gambit worked. The pro- 
prietor at last dragged out the 



MIDNIGHT BY THE MORPHY WATCH 



9 




Morphy watch, saying softly, “Here 
is an odd old piece that might in- 
terest you. The case is solid gold. It 
threatens to catch your interest, 
does it not?” 

Ritter at last permitted himself a 
second devouring glance. It con- 
firmed the first. Beyond shadow of 
a doubt this was the genuine relic 
that had haunted his thoughts for 
two thirds of a lifetime. 

What he said was “It’s odd, all 
right. What are those funny little 
figures it has in place of hours?” 

“Chessmen,” the other explain- 
ed. “See, that’s a King at six 
o’clock, a pawn at five, a Bishop at 
four, a Knight at three, a Rook at 
two, a Queen at one, another King 
at midnight, and then repeat, 
eleven to seven, around the dial.” 

“Why midnight rather than 
noon?” Ritter asked stupidly. He 
knew why. 

The proprietor’s wrinkled finger- 
nail indicated a small window just 
above the center of the face. In it 
showed the letters P.M. “That’s 
another rare feature,” he explain- 
ed. “I’ve handled very few watches 
that knew the difference between 
night and day.” 

“Oh, and I suppose those squares 
on which the chessmen are placed 
and which go around the dial in two 
and a half circles make a sort of 
checkerboard?” 

“Chessboard,” the other correct- 
ed. “Incidentally, there are exactly 
64 squares, the right number.” 

Ritter nodded. “I suppose you’re 



asking a fortune for it,” he remark- 
ed, as if making conversation. 

The other shrugged. “Only a 
thousand dollars.” 

Ritter’s heart skipped a beat. He 
had more than ten times that in his 
bank account. A trifle, considering 
the stake. 

But he bargained for the sake of 
appearances. At one point he 
argued, “But the watch doesn’t, 
run, I suppose.” 

“But it still has its hands,” the 
old Balt with the hauntingly 
familiar face countered. “And it 
still has its works, as you can tell by 
the weight. They could be repaired, 

1 imagine. A French movement. 
See, there’s the hexagonal winding- 
key still with it.” 

A price of seven hundred , dollars 
was finally agreed on. He paid out 
the fifty dollars he always carried 
with him and wrote a check for the 
remainder. After a call to his bank, 
it was accepted. 

The watch was packed in a small 
box in a nest of fluffy cotton. Ritter 
put it in a pocket of his jacket and 
buttoned the flap. 

He felt dazed. The Morphy 
watch, the watch Paul Morphy had 
kept his whole short life, despite his 
growing hatred of chess, the watch 
he had willed to his French admirer 
and favorite opponent Jules Arnous 
de Riviere, the watch that had then 
mysteriously disappeared, the 
watch of watches — was his! 

He felt both weightless and dizzy 
as he moved toward the street.

IF 




which blurred a little. 

As he was leaving he noticed in 
the window something he’d for- 
gotten — he wrote a check for fifty 
dollars for the silver barbarian 
pawn without bargaining. 

He was in the street, feeling 
glorious and very tired. Faces and 
umbrellas were alike blurs. Rain 
pattered on his face unnoticed, but 
there came a stab of anxiety. 

He held still and very carefully 
used his left hand to transfer the 
heavy little box — and the pawn in a 
twist of paper — to his trouser 
pocket, where he kept his left hand 
closed around them. Then he felt 
secure. 

He flagged down a cab and gave 
his home address. 

The passing scene began to come 
unblurred. He recognized Rimini’s 
Italian Restaurant where his own 
chess game was now having a little 
renaissance after five years of fore- 
going tournament chess because he 
knew he was too old for it. A chess- 
smitten young cook there, indulged 
by the owner, had organized a 
tourney. The entrants were mostly 
young people. A tall, moody girl he 
thought of as the Czarina, who 
played a remarkable game, and a 
likeable, loudmouthed young Jew- 
ish lawyer he thought of as Ras- 
putin, who played almost as good a 
game and talked a better one, both 
stood out. On impulse Ritter had 
entered the tournament because it 
was such a trifling one that it didn’t 
really break his rule against playing 



serious’ chess. And, his old skills 
reviving nicely, he had done well 
enough to have a firm grip on third 
place, right behind Rasputin and 
the Czarina. 

But now that he had the Morphy 
watch . 

Why the devil should he think 
that having the Morphy watch 
should improve his chess game? he 
asked himself sharply. It was as 
silly as faith in the power of the 
relics of saints. 

In his hand inside his left pocket 
the watch box vibrated eagerly, as 
if it contained a big live insect, a 
golden bee or beetle. But that, of 
course, was his imagination. 

Stirf Ritter-Rebil (a proper 
name, he always felt, for a chess 
player, since they specialize in 
weird ones, from Euwe to Znosko- 
Borovsky, from Noteboom to Dus- 
Chotimirski) lived in a one-room 
and bath, five blocks west of Union 
Square and packed with files, 
books and also paintings wherever 
the wall space allowed, of his dead 
wife and parents, and of his son. 
Now that he was older, he liked 
living with clues to all of his life in 
view. There was a fine view of the 
Pacific and the Golden Gate and 
their fogs to the west, over a sea of 
roofs. On the orderly cluttered 
tables were two fine chess sets with 
positions set up. 

Ritter cleared a space beside one 
of them and set in its center the box 
and packet. After a brief pause — 
as if for propitiatory prayer, he told 



MIDNIGHT BY THE MORPHY WATCH

himself sardonically — he gingerly 
took out the Morphy watch and 
centered it for inspection with the 
unwrapped silver pawn behind it. 

Then, wiping and adjusting his 
glasses and from time to time em- 
ploying a large magnifying glass, he 
examined both treasures exhaus- 
tively. 

The outer edge of the dial was 
circled with a ring or wheel of 24 
squares, 12 pale and 12 dark alter- 
nating, On the pale squares were 
the figures of chessmen indicating 
the hours, placed in the order the 
old Balt had described. The Black 
pieces went from midnight to five 
and were of silver set with tiny 
emeralds or bright jade, as his 
magnifying glass confirmed. The 
White pieces went from six to 
eleven and were of gold set with 
minute rubies or amythysts. He re- 
called that descriptions of the 
watch always mentioned the figures 
as being colored. 

Inside that came a second circle 
of 24 pale and dark squares. 

Finally, inside that , there was a 
two-thirds circle of 16 squares 
below the center of the dial. 

In the corresponding space above 
the center was the little window 
showing PM. 

The hands on the dial were 
stopped at 1157 — three minutes to 
midnight. 

With a paperknife he carefully 
pried open the hinged back of the 
watch, on which were floridly en- 
graved the initials PM — which he 



suddenly realized also stood for 
Paul Morphy. 

On the inner* golden back cover- 
ing the works was engraved “France 
H&H” — the old Balt was right 
again — while scratched in very 
tiny — he used his magnifier once 
more — were a half dozen sets of 
numbers, most of the sevens having 
the French slash. Pawnbrokers’ 
marks. Had Arnous de Riviere 
pawned the treasure? Or later 
European owners? Oh well, chess 
players were an impecunious lot. 
There was also a hole by which the 
watch could be wound with its 
hexagonal key. He carefully wound 
it but of course nothing happened. 

He closed the back and brooded 
on the dial. The 64 squares — 24 
plus 24 plus 16 — made a fantastic 
circular board. One of the many 
variants of chess he had played 
once or twice was cylindrical. 

“ Les echecs fantasques , “ he 
quoted. “It’s a cynical madman’s 
allegory with its doddering mon- 
arch, vampire queen, gangster 
knights, double-faced bishops, 
ramming rooks and inane pawns, 
whose supreme ambition is to 
change their sex and share the 
dodderer’s bed.’’ 

With a sigh of regret he tore his 
gaze away from the watch and took 
up the pawn behind it. Here was a 
grim little fighter, he thought, 
bringing the tarnished silver figure 
close to his glasses. Naked long- 
sword clasped against his chest, 
point down, iron skullcap low on

IF 




forehead, face merciless as Death’s. 
What did the golden legionaries 
look like? 

Then Ritter’s expression grew 
grim too, as he decided to do some- 
thing he’d had in mind ever since 
glimpsing the barbarian pawn in 
the window. Making a long arm, he 
slid out a file drawer and after 
flipping a few tabs drew out a 
folder marked “Death of Alek- 
hine.” The light was getting bad. 
He switched on a big desk lamp 
against the night. 

Soon he was studying a singularly 
empty photograph. It was of an un- 
occupied old armchair with a peg-in 
chess set open on one of the flat 
wooden arms. Behind the chess set 
stood a tiny figure. Bringing the 
magnifying glass once more into 
play, he confirmed what he had 
expected: that it was a precise mate 
to the barbarian pawn he had 
bought today. 

He glanced through another item 
from the folder — an old letter on 
onionskin paper in a foreign script 
with cedillas under half the “C’s” 
and tildas over half the “A’s.” 

It was from his Portuguese 
friend, explaining that the photo 
was a reproduction of one in the 
Lisbon police files. 

The photo was of the chair in 
which Alexander Alekhine had 
been found dead of a heart attack 
on the top floor of a cheap Lisbon 
rooming house in 1946. 

Alekhine had won the World’s 
Chess Championship from Capa- 



blanca in 1927. He had held the 
world’s record for the greatest 
number of games played simultane- 
ously and blindfolded — 32. In 1946 
he was preparing for an official 
match with the Russian champion 
Botvinnik, although he had played 
chess for the Axis in World War II. 
Though at times close to psychosis, 
he was considered the profoundest 
and most brilliant attacking player 
who had ever lived. 

Had he also, Ritter asked him- 
self, been one of the players to own 
the Morphy silver-and-gold chess 
set and the Morphy watch? 

He reached for another file folder 
labeled “Death of Steinitz.” This 
time he found a brownish daguer- 
reotype showing an empty, narrow, 
old-fashioned hospital bed with a 
chessboard and set on a small table 
beside it. Among the chess pieces, 
Ritter’s magnifier located another 
one of the unmistakable barbarian 
pawns. 

Wilhelm Steinitz, called the Fa- 
ther of Modern Chess, who had 
held the world’s championship for 
28 years, until his defeat by Em- 
manuel Lasker in 1894. Steinitz, 
who had had two psychotic epi- 
sodes and been hospitalized for 
them in the last years of his life, 
during the second of which he had 
believed he could move the chess 
pieces by electricity and challenged 
God to a match, offering God the 
odds of Pawn and Move. It was 
after the second episode that the 
daguerreotype had been taken

which Ritter had acquired many 
years ago from the aged Emmanuel 
Lasker. 

Ritter leaned back wearily from 
the table, took off his glasses and 
knuckled his tired eyes. It was later 
than he’d imagined. 

He thought about Paul Morphy 
retiring from chess at the age of 21 
after beating every important player 
in the world and issuing a chal- 
lenge, never accepted, to take on 
any master at the odds of Pawn and 
Move. After that contemptuous 
gesture in 1859 he had brooded for 
25 years, mostly a recluse in his 
family home in New Orleans, 
emerging only fastidiously dressed 
and be-caped for an afternoon pro- 
menade and regular attendance at 
the opera. He suffered paranoid 
episodes during which he believed 
his relatives were trying to steal his 
fortune and, of all things, his 
clothes. And he never spoke of 
chess or played it, except for an oc- 
casional game with his friend 
Maurian at the odds of Knight and 
Move. 

Twenty-five years of brooding in 
solitude without the solace of play- 
ing chess, but with the Morphy 
chess set and the Morphy watch in 
the same room, testimonials to his 
world mastery. 

Ritter wondered if those circum- 
stances — with Morphy constantly 
thinking of chess, he felt sure — 
were not ideal for the transmission 
of the vibrations of thought and 
feeling into inanimate objects, in 



this case the golden Morphy set and 
watch. 

Material objects intangibly vi- 
brating with 25 years of the greatest 
chess thought and then by strange 
chance (chance alone?) falling into 
the hands of two other periodically 
psychotic chess champions, as the 
photographs of the pawns hinted. 

An absurd fancy, Ritter told 
himself. And yet one to the pursuit 
of which he had devoted no small 
part of his life. 

And now the richly vibrant ob- 
jects were in his hands. What 
would be the effect of that on his 
game? 

But to speculate in that direction 
was doubly absurd. 

A wave of tiredness went through 
him. It was close to midnight. 

He heated a small supper for 
himself, consumed it, drew the 
heavy window drapes tight, and un- 
dressed. 

He turned back the cover of the 
big couch next to the table, switch- 
ed off the light, and inserted him- 
self into bed. 

It was Ritter’s trick to put him- 
self to sleep by playing through a 
chess opening in his thoughts. Like 
any talented player, he could 
readily contest one blindfold game, 
though he could not quite visualize 
the entire board and often had to 
count moves square by square, es- 
pecially with the Bishops. He select- 
ed Breyer’s Gamit, an old favorite 
of his. 

He made a half dozen moves. 



14 



IF 




Then suddenly the board was 
brightly illuminated in his mind, as 
if a light had been turned on there. 
He had to stare around to assure 
himself that the room was still dark 
as pitch. There was only the bright 
board inside his head. 

His sense of awe was lost in 
luxuriant delight. He moved the 
mental pieces rapidly, yet saw deep 
into the possibilities of each posi- 
tion. 

Far in the background he heard 
a church clock on Franklin boom 
out the dozen strokes of midnight. 
After a short while he announced 
mate in five by White. Black 
studied the position for perhaps a 
minute, then resigned. 

Lying flat on his back he took 
several deep breaths. Never before 
had he played such a brilliant 
blindfold game — or game with sight 
even. That it was a game with 
himself didn’t seem to matter — his 
personality had split neatly into two 
players. 

He studied the final position for 
a last time, returned the pieces to 
their starting positions in his head, 
and rested a bit before beginning 
another game. 

It was then he heard the ticking, 
a nervous sound five times as fast as 
the distant clock had knelled. He 
lifted his wristwatch to his ear. Yes, 
it was ticking rapidly too, but this 
was another ticking, louder. 

He sat up silently in bed, leaned 
over the table, switched on the 
light. 



T he Morphy watch. That was 
where the louder ticks were 
coming from. The hands stood at 
twelve ten and thtf small window 
showed AM. 

For a long while he held that po- 
sition — mute, motionless, aghast, 
wondering, fearing, doubting, 
dreaming dreams no mortal ever* 
dared to dream before. 

Let’s see, Edgar Allan Poe had 
died when Morphy was 12 years old 
and beating his uncle, Ernest Mor- 
phy, then chess king of New Or- 
leans. 

It seemed impossible that a 
stopped watch with works well over 
one hundred years old should begin 
to run. Doubly impossible that it 
should begin to run at approxi- 
mately the right time — his wrist 
watch and the Morphy watch were 
no more than a minute apart. 

Yet the works might be in better 
shape than either he or the old Balt 
had guessed; watches did caprici- 
ously start and stop running. Co- 
incidences were only coincidences. 

Yet he felt profoundly uneasy. 
He pinched himself and went 
through the other childish tests. 

He said aloud, “I am Stirf Ritter- 
Rebil, an old man who lives in San 
Francisco and plays chess, and who 
yesterday discovered an unusual 
curio. But really, everything is per- 
fectly normal ...” 

Nevertheless, he suddenly got the 
feeling of “A man-eating lion is a- 
prowl.” It was the childish form 
terror still took for him on rare oc- 



MIDNIGHT BY THE MORPHY WATCH

casions. For a minute or so every- 
thing seemed too still, despite the 
ticking. The stirring of the heavy 
drapes at the window gave him a 
shiver, and the walls seemed thin, 
their protective power nil. 

Gradually the sense of a killer 
lion moving outside them faded 
and his nerves calmed. 

He switched off the light, the 
bright mental board returned, and 
the ticking became reassuring 
rather, than otherwise. He began 
another game with himself, playing 
for Black the Classical Defense to 
the Ruy Lopez, another of his 
favorites. 

This game proceeded as bril- 
liantly and vividly as the first. 
There was the sense of a slim, 
man-shaped glow standing beside 
the bright board in the mental 
dark. After a while the shape grew 
amorphous and less bright; then 
split into three. However, it both- 
ered him little, and when he at last 
announced mate in three for Black, 
he felt great satisfaction and pro- 
found fatigue. 

Next day he was in exceptionally 
good spirits. Sunlight banished all 
night’s terrors as he went about his 
ordinary business and writing 
chores. From time to time he reas- 
sured himself that he could still 
visualize a mental chessboard very 
clearly, and he thought now and 
again about the historical chess 
mystery he was in the midst of solv- 
ing. The ticking of the Morphy 
watch carried an exciting, eager 



note. Toward the end of the after- 
noon he realized he was keenly an- 
ticipating visiting Rimini’s to show 
off his new-found skill. 

He got out an old gold watch 
chain and fob, snapped it to the 
Morphy watch, which he carefully 
wound again, pocketed them se- 
curely in his vest, and set out for 
Rimini’s. It was a grand day — cool, 
brightly sunlit and a little windy. 
His steps were brisk. He wasn’t 
thinking of all the strange happen- 
ings but of chess . It’s been said that 
a man can lose his wife one day and 
forget her that night, playing chess . 

Rimini’s was a good, dark, gar- 
lic-smelling restaurant with an an- 
nex devoted to drinks, substantial 
free pasta appetizers and, for the 
nonce, chess. As he drifted into the 
long L-shaped room, Ritter became 
pleasantly aware of the row of 
boards, chessmen, and the intent, 
mostly young, faces bent above 
them. 

Then Rasputin was grinning at 
him calculatedly and yapping at 
him cheerfully. They were due to 
play their tournament game. They 
checked out a set and were soon at 
it. Beside them the Czarina also 
contested a crucial game, her 
moody face askew almost as if her 
neck were broken, her bent wrists 
near her chin, her long fingers 
pointing rapidly at her pieces as she 
calculated combinations, like a sor- 
ceress putting a spell on them. 

Ritter was aware of her, but only 
peripherally. For last night’s bright

mental board had returned, only 
now it was superimposed on the 
actual board before him. Complex 
combinations sprang to mind ef- 
fortlessly. He beat Rasputin like a 
child. The Czarina caught the win 
from the corner of her eye and 
growled faintly in approval. She 
was winning her own game; Ritter 
beating Rasputin bumped her into 
first place. Rasputin was silent for 
once. 

A youngish man with a black 
mustache was sharply inspecting 
Ritter’s win. He was the California 
state champion, Martinez, who had 
recently played a simultaneous at 
Rimini’s, winning fifteen games, 
losing none, drawing only with the 
Czarina. He now suggested a casual 
game to Ritter, who nodded some- 
what abstractedly. 

They contested two very hairy 
games — a Sicilian Defense by Mar- 
tinez in which Ritter advanced all 
his pawns in front of his castled 
King in a wild-looking attack, and 
a Ruy Lopez by Martinez that 
Ritter answered with the Classical 
Defense, going to great lengths to 
preserve his powerful King’s 
Bishop. The mental board stayed 
superimposed, and it almost seem- 
ed to Ritter that there was a small 
faint halo over the piece he must 
next move or capture. To his mild 
astonishment he won both games. 

A small group of chess-playing 
onlookers had gathered around 
their board. Martinez was looking 
at him speculatively, as if to ask, 



“Now just where did you spring 
from, old man, with your power 
game? I don’t recall ever hearing of 
you.” 

Ritter’s contentment would have 
been complete, except that among 
the kibitzers, toward the back, 
there was a slim young man whose 
face was always shadowed when 
Ritter glimpsed it. Ritter saw him 
in three different places, though 
never in movement and never for 
more than an instant. Somehow he 
seemed one onlooker too many. 
This disturbed Ritter obscurely, 
and his face had a thoughtful, 
abstracted expression when he 
finally quit Rimini’s for the faintly 
drizzling evening streets. After a 
block he looked around, but so far 
as he could tell, he wasn’t being 
followed. This time he walked the 
whole way to his apartment, passing 
several landmarks of Dashiell 
Hammett, Sam Spade, and The 
Maltese Falcon. 

Gradually, under the benizon of 
the foggy droplets, his mood chang- 
ed to one of exaltation. He had just 
now played some beautiful chess, 
he was in the midst of an amazing 
historic chess mystery he’d always 
yearned to penetrate, and somehow 
the Morphy watch was working for 
him — he could actually hear its 
mu filed ticking in the street, com- 
ing up frorp his waist to his ear. 

Tonight his room was a most wel- 
come retreat, his place, like an ex- 
tension of his mind. He fed himself. 
Then he reviewed, with a Sherlock 



18 



IF 




Holmes smile, what he found him- 
self calling “Th? Curious Case of 
the Morphy Timepiece.” He wished 
he had a Dr. Watson to hear him 
expound. First, the appearance of 
the watch after Morphy returned to 
New York on the Persia in 1859. 
Over paranoid years Morphy had 
imbued it with psychic energy and 
vast chessic wisdom. Or else — mark 
this. Doctor — he had set up the 
conditions whereby subsequent 
owners of the watch would think he 
had done such, for the supernatu- 
ral is not our bailiwick, Watson. 
Next (after de Riviere) great Steinitz 
had come into possession of it and 
challenged God and died mad. 
Then, after a gap, paranoid Alek- 
hine had owned it and devised 
diabolically brilliant, hyper-Mor- 
phian strategies of attack, and died 
all alone after a thousand treach- 
eries in a miserable Lisbon flat with 
a peg-in chess set and the telltale 
barbarian pawn next to his corpse. 
Finally after a hiatus of almost 
thirty years (where had the watch 
and set been then? Who’d had their 
custody? Who was the old Balt?) 
the timepiece and a pawn had come 
into his own possession. A unique 
case, Doctor. There isn’t even a 
parallel in Prague in 1863. 

The nighted fog pressed against 
the windowpane and now and again 
a little rain pattered. San Francisco 
was a London City and had its own 
resident great detective. One of 
Dashiell Hammett’s hobbies had 
been chess, even though there was 



no record of Spade having played 
the game. 

From time to time Ritter studied 
the Morphy watch as it glowed and 
ticked on the table space he’d clear- 
ed. PM once mpre, he noted. The 
time: White Queen, ruby glittering, 
past Black King, microscopically 
emerald studded — 1 mean five min- 
utes past midnight, Doctor. The 
witching hour, as the superstitious- 
ly-minded would have it. 

But to bed, to bed, Watson. We 
have much to do tomorrow — and, 
paradoxically, tonight. 

Seriously, Ritter was glad when 
the golden glow winked out on the 
watch face, though the strident 
ticking kept on, and he wriggled 
himself into his couch-bed and ar- 
ranged himself for thought. The 
mental board flashed on once more 
and he began to play. First he re- 
viewed all the best games he’d ever 
played in his life — there weren’t 
very many — discovering variations 
he’d never dreamed of before. Then 
he played through all his favorite 
games in the history of chess, from 
MacDonnell-La Bourdonnais to 
Fischer-Spasski, not forgetting 
Steinitz-Zukertort and Alekhine- 
Bogolyubov. They were richer 
masterpieces than ever before — the 
mental board saw very deep. 
Finally he split his mind again and 
challenged himself to an eight-game 
blindfold match, Black against 
White. Against all expectation. 
Black won with three wins, two 
losses, and three draws. 



MIDNIGHT BY THE MORPHY WATCH 



19 




But the night was not all imagi- 
native and ratiocinative delight. 
Twice there came periods of eerie 
silence, which the ticking of the 
watch in the dark made only more 
complete, and two spells of the 
man-eating lion a-prowl that raised 
his hair at the roots. Once again 
there loomed the slim, faint, man- 
shaped glow beside the mental 
board and he wouldn’t go away. 
Worse, he was joined by two other 
man-shaped glows, one short and 
stocky, with a limp, the other fairly 
tall, stocky too, and restless. These 
inner intruders bothered Ritter in- 
creasingly — who were they? And 
wasn’t there beginning to be a faint 
fourth? He recalled the slim young 
elusive watcher with shadowed face 
of his games with Martinez and 
wondered if there was a connection. 

Disturbing stuff — and most dis- 
turbing of all, the apprehension 
that his mind might be racked 
apart and fragmented abroad with 
all its machine-gun thinking, that it 
already extended by chessic veins 
from one chess-playing planet to 
another, to the ends of the universe. 

He was profoundly glad when 
toward the end of his self-match, 
his brain began to dull and slow. 
His last memory was of an attempt 
to invent a game to be played on the 
circular board on the watch dial. 
He thought he was succeeding as 
his mind at last went spiraling off 
into unconsciousness. 

Next day he awoke restless, 
scratchy, and eager — and with the 



feeling that the three or four dim 
figures had stood around his couch 
all night vibrating’like strobe lights 
to the rhythm of the Morphy watch. 

Coffee heightened his alert ner- 
vousness. He rapidly dressed, 
snapped the Morphy watch to its 
chain and fob, pocketed the silver 
pawn, and went out to hunt down 
the store where he’d purchased the 
two items. 

In a sense he never found it, 
though he tramped and minutely 
scanned Montgomery, Kearny, 
Grant, Stockton, Clay, Sacra- 
mento, California, Pine, Bush, and 
all the rest. 

What he did find at long last was 
a store window with a grotesque 
pattern of dust on it that he was 
certain was identical with that on 
the window through which he had 
first glimpsed the barbarian Pawn 
day before yesterday. 

Only now the display space be- 
hind the window was empty and the 
whole store too, except for a tall, 
lanky Black with a fabulous Afro 
hair-do, sweeping up. 

Ritter struck up a conversation 
with the man as he worked, and 
slowly winning his confidence, dis- 
covered that he was one of three 
partners opening a store there that 
would be stocked solely with Afri- 
can imports. 

Finally, after the Black had 
fetched a great steaming pail of 
soapy water and a long-handled 
roller mop and begun to efface for- 
ever the map of dust by which

IF 




Ritter had identified the place, the 
man at last grew confidential. 

“Yeah,” he said, “there was a 
queer old character had a second- 
hand store here until yesterday that 
had every crazy thing you could dig 
for sale, some junk, some real 
fancy. Then he cleared everything 
out into two big trucks in a great 
rush, with me breathing down his 
neck every minute because he’d 
been supposed to do it the day 
before. 

“Oh, but he was a fabulous cat, 
though,” the Black went on with a 
reminiscent grin as he sloshed away 
the last peninsulas and archipelagos 
of the dust map. “One time he said 
to me, ‘Excuse me while I rest,’ 
and — you’re not going to believe 
this — he went into a corner and 
stood on his head. I’m telling you 
he did, man. I’d like to bust a gut. 
1 thought he’d have a stroke — and 
he did get a bit lavender in the 
face — but after three minutes 
exact — I timed him — he flipped 
back onto his feet neat as you could 
ask and went on with his work twice 
as fast as before, supervising his 
carriers out of their skulls. Wow, 
that was an event.” 

Ritter departed without com- 
ment. He had got the final clue 
he’d been seeking to the identity of 
the old Balt and likewise the fourth 
and most shadowy form that had 
begun to haunt his mental chess- 
board. 

Casually standing on his head, 
saying “It threatens to catch your 



interest” — why, it had to be Aaron 
Nimzovich, most hyper-eccentric 
player of them all and Father of 
Hypermodern Chess, who had been 
Alekhine’s most dangerous but 
ever-evaded challenger. Why, the 
old Balt had even looked exactly 
like an aged Nimzovich — hence 
Ritter’s constant sense of a facial 
familiarity. Of course, Nimzovich 
had supposedly died in the 1930’s 
in his home city of Riga in the 
U.S.S.R., but what were life and 
breath to the forces with which 
Ritter was now embroiled? 

It seemed to him that there were 
four dim figures stalking him re- 
lentlessly as lions right now in the 
Chinatown crowds, while despite 
the noise he could hear and feel the 
ticking of the Morphy watch at his 
waist. 

He tied to the Danish Kitchen at 
the St. Francis Hotel and con- 
sumed cup on cup of good coffee 
and two orders of Eggs Benedict, 
and had his mental chessboard 
flashing on and off in his mind like 
a strobe light, and wondered if he 
shouldn’t hurl the Morphy watch 
into the Bay to be rid of the influ- 
ence racking his mind apart and 
destroying his sense of reality. 

But then with the approach of 
evening, the urge toward chess 
gripped him more and more im- 
periously and he headed once again 
for Rimini’s. 

Rasputin and the Czarina were 
there and also Martinez again, and 
with the last a distinguished silver- 



MIDNIGHT BY THE MORPHY WATCH 



21 




haired man whom Martinez intro- 
duced as the South American inter- 
national master, Pontebello, sug- 
gesting that he and Ritter have a 
quick game. 

The board glowed again with the 
superimposed mental one, the halos 
were there once more, and Ritter 
won as if against a tyro. 

At that, chess fever seized him 
entirely and he suggested he im- 
mediately play four simultaneous 
blindfold games with the two mas- 
ters and the Czarina and Rasputin, 
Pontebello acting also as referee. 

There were incredulous looks a- 
plenty at that, but he had won 
those two games from Martinez 
and now the one from Pontebello, 
so arrangements were quickly 
made, Ritter insisting on an actual 
blindfold. All the other players 
crowded around to observe. 

The simul began. There were 
now four mental boards glowing in 
Ritter’s mind. It did not matter — 
now — that there were four dim 
forms with them, one by each. 
Ritter played with a practiced bril- 
liance, combinations bubbled, he 
called out his moves crisply and un- 
erringly. And so he beat the Czarina 
and Rasputin quickly. Pontebello 
took a little longer, and he drew 
with Martinez by perpetual check. 

There was silence as he took off 
the blindfold to scan a circle of as- 
tonished faces and four shadowed 
ones behind them. He felt the joy of 
absolute chess mastery. The only 
sound he heard was the ticking,. 



thunderous to him, of the Morphy 
watch. 

Pontebello was first to speak. To 
Ritter, “Do you realize, master, 
what you’ve just done?” To Marti- 
nez, “Have you the scores of all 
four games?” To Ritter again, “Ex- 
cuse me, l)ut you look pale, as if 
you’ve just seen a ghost.” “Four,” 
Ritter corrected quietly. “Those of 
Morphy, Steinitz, Alekhine, and 
Nimzovich.” 

“Under the circumstances, most 
appropriate,” commented Ponte- 
bello, while Ritter sought out again 
the four shadowed faces in the 
background. They were still there, 
though they had shifted their posi- 
tions and withdrawn a little into the 
varied darknesses of Rimini’s. 

Amid talk of scheduling another 
blindfold exhibition and writing a 
multiple-signed letter describing to- 
night’s simul to the U.S. Chess 
Federation — not to mention Ponte- 
bello’s searching queries as to 
Ritter's chess career — he tore him- 
self away and made for home 
through the dark streets, certain 
that four shadowy figures stalked 
behind him. The call of the mental 
chess in his own room was not to be 
denied. 

Ritter forgot no moment of that 
night, for he did not sleep at all. 
The glowing board in his mind was 
an unquenchable beacon, an all- 
demanding mandala. He replayed 
all the important games of history, 
finding new moves. He contested 
two matches with himself, then one 



22 



IF 




each with Morphy, Steinitz, Alek- 
hine and Nimzovich, winning the 
first two, drawing the third, and 
losing the last by a half point. 
Nimzovich was the only one to 
speak, saying, “I am both dead and 
alive, as I’m sure you know. Please 
don’t smoke, or threaten to.” 

He stacked eight mental boards 
and, played two games of three- 
dimensional chess. Black winning 
both. He traveled to the ends of the 
universe, finding chess everywhere 
he went, and contesting a long 
game, more complex than 3-D 
chess, on which the fate of the uni- 
verse depended. He drew it. 

And all through the long night 
the four were with him in the room 
and the man-eating lion stared in 
through the window with black- 
and-white checkered mask and 
silver mane. While the Morphy 
watch ticked like a death-march 
drum. All figures vanished when 
the dawn came creeping, though 
the mental board stayed bright and 
busy into full daylight and showed 
no signs of vanishing ever. Ritter 
felt overpoweringly tired, his mind 
racked to atoms, on the verge of 
death. 

But he knew what he had to do. 
He got a small box and packed into 
it, in cotton wool, the silver bar- 
barian Pawn, the old photograph 
and daguerrotype, and a piece of 
paper on which he scribbled only: 

Morphy, 1859-1884 

de Riviere, 1884 - ? 

Steinitz, ? - 1900 



Alekhine, ? - 1946 
Nimzovich, 1946 - now 
Ritter-Rebil, 3 days 
Then he packed the watch in the 
box too, it stopped ticking, its 
hands were still at last, and in 
Ritter’s mind the mental board 
winked out. 

He took one last devouring gaze 
at the grotesque, glittering dial. 
Then he shut the box, wrapped and 
sealed and corded it, boldly wrote 
on it in black ink “Chess Champion 
of the World” and added the 
proper address. 

He took it to the post office on 
Van Ness and sent it off by regis- 
tered mail. Then he went home and 
slept like the dead. 

R itter never received a response. 

But he never got the box back 
either. Sometimes he wonders if the 
subsequent strange events in the 
Champion’s life might have had 
anything to do with the gift. 

And on even rarer occasions he 
wonders what would have happened 
if he had faced the challenge of 
death and let his mind be racked to 
bits, if that was what was to 
happen. 

But on the whole he is content. 
Questions from Martinez and the 
others he has put off with purpose- 
fully vague remarks. 

He still plays chess at Rimini’s. 
Once he won another game from 
Martinez, when the latter was con- 
testing a simul against twenty-three 
players.

Dedicated to every traffic cop who ever fiew. 



BOB SHAW 



T he dead cop came drifting in 
toward the Birmingham control 
zone at a height of some three thou- 
sand meters. It was a winter night 
and the sub-zero temperatures 
which prevailed at that altitude had 
solidified his limbs, encrusted his 
entire body with black frost. Blood 
flowing through shattered armour 
had frozen into the semblance of a 
crab, with its claws encircling his 
chest. The body, which floated up- 
right, rocked gently on stray cur- 
rents, performing a strange aerial 
shuffle. And at its waist a pea- 
sized crimson light blinked on and 
off, on and off, its radiance grad- 
ually fading under a thickening 
coat of ice. 

air police Sergeant Robert 
rV Hasson felt more exhausted 



and edgy than he would have done 
after an eight-hour crosswind pa- 
trol. He had been in the head- 
quarters block since lunchtime, 
dictating and signing reports, com- 
pleting forms, trying to wrest from 
the cashier’s office the expenses 
which had been due to him two 
months earlier. And then, just as 
he was about to go home in disgusjt, 
he had been summoned to Captain 
Nunn’s office for yet another con- 
frontation over the Wellwyn Angels 
case. The four on remand — Joe 
Sullivan, Flick Bugatti, Denny 
Johnston and Toddy Thoms — were 
sitting together at one side of the 
office, still wearing their flying 
gear. 

“I’ll tell you what disturbs me 
most about this whole affair,” 
Bunny Ormerod, the senior bar- 



27 




rister, was saying with practiced 
concern. “It is the utter indiffer- 
ence of the police. It is the callous- 
ness with which the tragic death of 
a child is accepted by the arresting 
officers.” Ormerod moved closer to 
the four Angels, protectively, iden- 
tifying with them. “One would 
think it was an everyday oc- 
currence.” 

Hasson shrugged. “It is, practi- 
cally.” 

Ormerod allowed his jaw to sag 
and turned so that the brooch re- 
corder on his silk blouse was point- 
ing straight at Hasson. “Would you 
care to repeat that statement?” 

Hasson stared directly into the 
recorder’s watchful iris. “Prac- 
tically every day, or every night, 
some moron straps on a CG har- 
ness, goes flying around at five or 
six hundred kilometers an hour, 
thinking he’s Superman, and runs 
into a pylon or a towerblock. And 
you’re dead right — I don’t give a 
damn when they smear them- 
selves.” Hasson could see Nunn be- 
coming agitated but he pressed on 
doggedly. “It’s only when they 
smash into other people that I get 
worked up. And. then I go after 
them.” 

“You hunt them down.” 

“That’s what I do.” 

“The way you hunted down these 
children.” 

Hasson examined the Angels 
coldly. “I don’t see any children. 
The youngest in that gang is six- 
teen.” 



Ormerod directed a compassion- 
ate smile toward the four black-clad 
Angels. “We live in a complex and 
difficult world, Sergeant. Sixteen 
years isn’t a very long time for a 
youngster to get to know his way 
around it.” 

“Balls,” Hasson commented. He 
looked at the Angels again and 
pointed at a heavy-set, bearded 
youth who was sitting behind the 
others. “You — Toddy — come over 
here.” 

Toddy’s eyes shuttled briefly. 
“What for?” 

“I want to show Mr. Ormerod 
your badges.” 

“Naw. Don’t want to,” Toddy 
said smugly. “Sides, I like it better 
over here.” 

Hasson sighed, walked- to the 
group, caught hold of Toddy’s lapel 
and walked back to Ormerod as if 
he was holding nothing but the 
piece of simulated leather. Behind 
him he heard frantic swearing and 
the sound of chairs falling over as 
Toddy was dragged through the 
protective screen of his com- 
panions. The opportunity to ex- 
press his feelings in action, no 
matter how limited, gave Hasson a 
therapeutic satisfaction. 

Nunn half rose to his feet. “What 
do you think you’re doing, Ser- 
geant?” 

Hasson ignored him, addressing 
himself to Ormerod. “See this 
badge? The big ‘F with wings on 
it? Do you know what it means?” 

“I’m more interested in what 



28 



IF 




your extraordinary behaviour 
means/’ One^of Ormerod’s hands 
was purposely, but with every ap- 
pearance of accident, blocking his 
recorder’s field of view. Hasson 
knew this was because of recent 
legislation under which the courts 
refused to consider any recorded 
evidence unless the entire spool was 
presented — and Ormerod did not 
want a shot of the badge. 

“Have a look at it.” Hasson re- 
peated his description of the badge 
for the benefit of the soundtrack. 
“It means that this quote child un- 
quote has had sexual intercourse in 
free fall. And he’s proud .of it. 
Aren’t you, Toddy?” 

“Mister Ormerod?” Toddy’s eyes 
were fixed pleadingly on the barris- 
ter’s face. 

“For your own good, Sergeant, I 
think you should let go of my 
client,” Ormerod said. His slim 
hand was still hovering in front of 
the recorder. 

“Certainly.” Hasson snatched 
the recorder, plucking a hole in 
Ormerod’s blouse as he did so, and 
held the little instrument in front of 
the Angel’s array of badges. After a 
moment he pushed Toddy away 
from him and gave the recorder 
back to Ormerod with a flourish of 
mock -courtesy. 

“That was a mistake, Hasson.” 
Ormerod’s aristocratic features had 
begun to show genuine anger. 
“You’ve made it obvious that you 
are engaging in a personal vendetta 
against my client.” 



Hasson laughed. “Toddy isn’t 
your client. You were hired by Joe 
Sullivan’s old man to get him out 
from under a manslaughter charge 
and big simple Toddy just happens 
to be in the same bag.” 

Joe Sullivan, sitting in the center 
of the other three Angels, opened 
his mouth to retort but changed his 
mind. He appeared to have been 
better rehearsed than his com- 
panions. 

“That’s right,” Hasson said to 
him. “Remember what you were 
told, Joe — let the hired mouth do 
all the taking.” Sullivan shifted re- 
sentfully, stared down at his blue- 
knuckled hands, and remained 
silent. 

“It’s obvious wo aren’t achieving 
anything,” Ormerod said to Nunn. 
“I’m going to hold a private con- 
ference with my clients.” 

“Do that,” Hasson put in. “Tell 
them to peel off those badges, 
won’t you? Next time I might pick 
out an even better one.” He waited 
impassively while Ormerod and two 
policemen ushered the four Angels 
out of the room. 

“I don’t understand you,” Nunn 
said as soon as they were alone. 
“Exactly what did you think you 
were doing just now? That boy has 
only to testify that you manhandled 
him . .” 

“That boy, as you call him, 
knows where we could find the 
Fireman. They all do.” 

“You’re being too hard on 
them.” 



A LITTLE NIGHT FLYING 



29 




“You aren’t.” Hasson knew at 
once that he had gone too far but 
he was too obstinate to begin re- 
tracting the words. 

That do you mean?” Nunn’s 
W mouth compressed, mak- 
ing him look womanly but nonethe- 
less dangerous. 

“Why do I have to talk to that 
load of scruff up here in your 
office? What’s wrong with the 
interview rooms downstairs? Or are 
they only for thugs who haven’t got 
Sullivan money behind them?” 
“Are you saying I’ve taken Sulli- 
van’s money?” 

Hasson thought for a moment. 
“I don’t believe you’d do that, but 
you let it make a difference. I tell 
you those four have flown with the 
Fireman. If I could be left alone for 
half an hour with any one of them 
I’d . .” 

“You’d get yourself put away. 
You don’t seem to understand the 
way things are, Hasson. You’re a 
skycop — and that means the public 
doesn’t want you about. A hundred 
years ago motorists disliked traffic 
cops for making them obey a few 
common sense rules. Now every- 
body can tly, better than the birds, 
and they find this same breed of 
cop up there with them, spoiling 
it for them, and they hate you.” 
“I’m not worried.” 

“I don’t think you’re worried 
about police work either, Hasson. 
Not really. I’d say you’re hooked on 
cloud -running every bit as much as 



this mythical Fireman, but you 
want to play a different game.” 

Hasson became anxious, aware 
that Nunn was leading up to some- 
thing important. “The Fireman is 
real — I’ve seen him.” 

“Whether he is or not, I’m 
grounding you.” 

“You can’t do that,’’ Hasson 
blurted instinctively. 

Nunn looked interested. “Why 
not?” 

“Because . .” Hasson was striv- 
ing for the right words, any words, 
when the communicator sphere on 
Nunn’s desk lit up redly, signalling 
a top priority message. 

“Go ahead,” Nunn said to the 
sphere. 

“Sir, we’re picking up an auto- 
matic distress call,” it replied with 
a male voice. “Somebody drifting 
out of control at three thousand 
meters. We think it must be 
Inglis.” 

“Dead?” 

“We’ve interrogated his comm- 
pack, sir. No response.” 

“I see. Wait till the rush hour is 
over and send somebody up for 
him. I’ll want a full report.” 

“Yes sir.” 

“I’m going up for him now,” 
Hasson said, moving toward the 
door. 

“You can’t go through the traffic 
streams at this hour.” Nunn got to 
his feet and came around the desk. 
“And you’re grounded. I mean 
that, Hasson.” 

Hasson paused, knowing that he 



30 



IF 




had already stretched to the limit 
the special indulgence granted to 
members of the Air Patrol. “That’s 
Lloyd Inglis up there and I’m going 
up to get him — right now. If he’s 
dead. I’m grounding myself. Per- 
manently. Okay?’’ 

Nunn shook his head uncertain- 
ly. “Do you want to kill yourself?’’ 
“Perhaps.’’ Hasson closed the 
door and ran toward the tackle 
room. 

H e lifted off from the roof of 
the police headquarters into a 
sky which was ablaze with converg- 
ing rivers of fire. Work-weary com- 
muters pouring up from the south 
represented most of the Traffic but 
there were lesser tributaries flowing 
from many points of the compass 
into the vast aerial whirlpool of the 
Birmingham control zone. The 
shoulder-lights and ankle-lights of 
thousands upon thousands of fliers 
shifted and shimmered, changes of 
parallax causing spurious waves to 
progress and retrogress along the 
glowing streams. Vertical columns 
of brilliance kept the opposing ele- 
ments apart, creating an appear- 
ance of strict order. Hasson knew, 
however, that the appearance was 
to some extent deceptive. People 
who were in a hurry tended to 
switch off their lights to avoid de- 
tection and fly straight to where 
they were going, regardless of the 
air corridors. The chances of collid- 
ing with another illegal traveller 
were vanishingly small, they told 



themselves. But it was not only oc- 
casional salesmen late for appoint- 
ments who flew wild. There were 
the drunks and the druggies, the 
antisocial, the careless, the suicidal, 
the thrill-seekers, the criminal — a 
whole spectrum of types who were 
unready for the responsibilities of 
personal flight — in whose hands a 
counter-gravity harness could be- 
come an instrument of death. 

Hasson set his police flare units 
at maximum intensity. He climbed 
cautiously, dye gun at the ready, 
until the lights of the city were 
spread out below him in endless 
glowing geometries. When the in- 
formation display projected into 
the inner surface of his visor told 
him he was at a height of two 
hundred meters he began paying 
particular attention to his radar. 
This was the altitude at which 
rogue fliers were most numerous. 
He continued rising steadily, con- 
trolling the unease which was a 
normal reaction to being suspended 
in a darkness from which, at any 
moment, other beings could come 
hurtling toward him at lethal veloc- 
ity. The aerial river of travelers was 
now visible as separate laminae 
that slipped over each other like 
luminous gauze, uppermost levels 
moving fastest. 

A further eight hundred meters 
and Hasson began to relax slightly. 
He was turning his attention to the 
problem of homing in on Inglis 
when his proximity alarm sounded 
and the helmet radar flashed a 



A LITTLE NIGHT FLYING

bearing. Hasson twisted to face the 
indicated direction. The figure of a 
man flying without lights, angled 
for maximum speed, materialized 
in the light of Hasson’s flare units. 
Veteran of a thousand such en- 
counters, Hasson had time to cal- 
culate a miss distance of about ten 
meters. Within the fraction of a 
second available to him he aimed 
his gun and fired off a cloud of in- 
delible dye. The other man passed 
through it — glimpse of pale, elated 
face and dark unseeing eyes — and 
was gone in a noisy flurry of tur- 
bulence. Hasson called HQ and 
gave details of the incident, adding 
his opinion that the rogue flier was 
also guilty of drug abuse. With up- 
ward of a million people airborne in 
the sector at that very moment it 
was unlikely that the offender 
would ever be caught — but his fly- 
ing clothes and equipment had 
been permanently branded and 
would have to be replaced at con- 
siderable expense. 

At three thousand meters Hasson 
switched to height maintenance 
power, took a direction-finder read- 
ing on Inglis’s beacon and began a 
slow horizontal cruise, eyes probing 
the darkness ahead. His flares il- 
luminated a thickening mist, which 
placed him at the center of a sphere 
of foggy radiance and made it diffi- 
cult to see anything beyond. This 
was close to the limit for personal 
flying without special heaters and 
Hasson became aware of the cold 
which was pressing in on him, 



searching for a weakness in his de- 
fenses. The traffic streams far 
below looked warm and safe. 

A few minutes later Hasson’s 
radar picked up an object straight 
ahead. He drew closer until, by 
tlarelight, he could make out the 
figure of Lloyd Inglis performing its 
grotesque shuffle through the cur- 
rents of dark air. Hasson knew at 
once that his friend was dead but 
he circled the body, keeping just 
outside field interference distance, 
until he could see the gaping hole in 
Inglis’s chest plate. The wound 
looked as though it had been in- 
flicted by a lance . 

A week earlier Hasson and Inglis 
had been on routine patrol over 
Bedford when they had detected a 
pack of about eight flying without 
lights. Inglis had loosed off a mini- 
flare which burst just beyond the 
group, throwing them briefly into 
silhouette, and both men had 
glimpsed the slim outline of a 
lance. The transportation of any 
solid object by a person using a CG 
harness was illegal because of the 
danger to other air travelers and 
people on the ground, and the 
carrying of weapons was rare even 
among rogue fliers. It seemed likely 
that they had chanced on the Fire- 
man. Spreading their nets and 
snares, Hasson and Inglis had 
flown in pursuit. During the subse- 
quent low-level chase two people 
had died — one of them a young 
woman, also flying without lights, 
who had strayed into a head-on col-

lision with one of the gang. The 
other had been a pack leader who 
had almost cut himself in two on a 
radio mast. At the end of it, all the 
two policemen had had to show for 
their efforts had been four unim- 
portant members of the Wellwyn 
Angels. The fireman remained safe 
in his anonymity. 

Now, as he studied the frozen 
body of his former partner, Hasson 
understood that the Fireman had 
been inspired to revenge. His tar- 
gets would have been identified for 
him in the news coverage given to 
the arrest of Joe Sullivan. Swearing 
in his bitterness and grief, Hasson 
tilted his body to create a horizon- 
tal component in the lift force exert- 
ed by his CG harness. He swooped 
in on the rigid corpse, locked his 
arms around it. Immediately both 
bodies began to drop as their 
counter-gravity fields cancelled 
each other out. No stranger to free 
fall, Hasson efficiently attached a 
line to an eye on Inglis’s belt and 
pushed the dead man away from 
him. As the two separated to be- 
yond field interference distance the 
upward rush of air around them 
gradually ceased. Hasson checked 
his data display and saw that he 
had fallen little more than a hun- 
dred meters. He paid the line out 
from a dispenser at his waist until 
Inglis’s body was at a convenient 
towing distance. Then he flew west, 
aiming for a point at which it would 
be safe to descend through the com- 
muter levels. Far beneath him the 



traffic of the Birmingham control 
zone swirled like a golden galaxy, 
but Hasson — at the center of his 
own spherical universe of white 
misty light — was isolated from it, 
cocooned in his own thoughts. 

Lloyd Inglis — the beer-drinking, 
book-loving spendthrift— was dead. 
And before him there had been 
Singleton, Larmor and McMeekin. 
Half of Hasson’s original squad of 
seven years ago had died in the 
course of duty . and for what? It 
was impossible to police a human 
race which had been given its three- 
dimensional freedom with the ad- 
vent of the CG harness. Putting a 
judo hold on gravity, turning the 
Earth’s own attractive force back 
against itself, had proved to be the 
only way to fly. It was easy, inex- 
pensive, exhilarating — and impos- 
sible to regulate. There were eighty 
million personal fliers in Britain 
alone, each one a superman im- 
patient of any curb on his ability to 
follow the sunset around the curve 
of the world. Aircraft had vanished 
from the skies almost overnight, 
not because their cargo-carrying 
capacity was no long^ needed, but 
because it was too dangerous to fly 
them in a medium which was 
crowded with aerial jaywalkers. 
The nocturnal rogue flier r the dark 
Icarus, was the folk hero of the age. 
What, Hasson asked himself, was 
the point in being a skycop? Per- 
haps the whole concept of policing, 
of being responsible for others, was 
no longer valid. Perhaps the inevi- 



34 



IF 




table price of freedom was a slow 
rain of broken bodies drifting to 
Earth as their powerpacks faded 
and . 

T he attack took Hasson by sur- 
prise. 

It came so quickly that the prox- 
imity alarm and the howling of air 
displaced by the attacker’s body 
were virtually simultaneous. Hasson 
turned, saw the black lance, jack- 
knifed to escape it, received a 
ferocious glancing blow, and was 
sent spinning — all in the space of a 
second. The drop caused by the 
momentary field interference had 
been negligible. He switched off his 
flares and flight lights in a reflexive 
action and struggled to free his 
arms from the towline which was 
being lapped around him by his 
own rotation. When he had man- 
aged to stabilize himself he remain- 
ed perfectly still and tried to assess 
the situation. His right hip was 
throbbing painfully from the im- 
pact, but as far as he could tell no 
bones had been broken. He won- 
dered if his attacker was going to be 
content with having made a single 
devastating pass, or if this was the 
beginning of a duel. 

“You were quick, Hasson,” a 
voice called from the darkness. 
“Quicker than your wingman. But 
it won’t do you any good.” 

“Who are you?” Hasson shouted 
as he looked for a radar bearing. 

“You know who I am. I’m the 
Fireman.” 



“That’s a song.” Hasson kept his 
voice steady as he began spreading 
his snares and nets. “What’s your 
real name? The one your area psy- 
chiatrist has on his books,” he 
called out. 

The darkness laughed. “Very 
good, Sergeant Hasson. Playing for 
time and trying to goad me and 
learn my name all at once.” 

“I don’t need to play for time — 
I’ve already broadcast a QRF.” 
“By the time anybody gets here 
you’ll be dead, Hasson.” 

“Why should I be? Why do you 
want to do this?” 

“Why do you hunt my friends 
and ground them?” 

“They’re a menace to themselves 
and to everybody else.” 

“Only when you make them fly 
wild. You’re kidding yourself, Has- 
son. You’re a skycop and you like 
hounding people to death. I’m 
going to ground you for good — and 
those nets won’t help you.” 

Hasson stared vainly in the direc- 
tion of the voice. “Nets?” 

There was another laugh and the 
Fireman began to sing. “7 can see 
you in the dark, 'cause I'm the 
Fireman; I can fly with you and you 
don't even know I'm there . 
The familiar words were growing 
louder as their source drew near, 
and abruptly Hasson made out the 
shape of a big man illuminated by 
the traffic streams below and by 
starlight from above. He looked 
fearsome and inhuman in his flying 
gear. 



A LITTLE NIGHT FLYING 



35 




Hasson yearned for the firearm 
denied him by British police tradi- 
tion, and then he noticed some- 
thing. “Where’s the lance?” 

“Who needs it? I let it go.” The 
Fireman spread his arms and — even 
in the dimness, even with the lack 
of spatial reference points — it be- 
came apparent that he was a giant, 
a man who had no need of weapons 
other than those which nature had 
built into him. 

Hasson thought of the heavy 
lance plummeting down into a 
crowded suburb three thousand 
niters below and a cryogenic hat- 
red stole through him, reconciling 
him to the forthcoming struggle, re- 
gardless of its outcome. As the Fire- 
man edged closer Hasson whirled a 
net in slow circles, tilting his har- 
ness to counteract the spin induced 
by the net. He raised his legs in 
readiness to kick and at the same 
time finished straightening out the 
towline which made Inglis’s body a 
ghastly spectator to the event. He 
felt nervous and keyed up, but not 
particularly afraid now that the 
Fireman had discarded his lance. 
Aerial combat was not a matter of 
instinct; it was something which 
had to be learned and practiced, 
and therefore the professional al- 
ways had the edge on the amateur, 
no matter how gifted or strongly 
motivated the latter might be. For 
example, the Fireman had made a 
serious mistake in allowing Hasson 
to get his legs fully drawn up into 
the position from which the power 



of his thighs could be released in an 
explosive kick. 

Unaware of his blunder, the Fire- 
man edged in slowly, vectoring the 
lift of his harness with barely per- 
ceptible shoulder movements. He's 
a good flier , Hasson thought, even 
if he isn't so good on combat theory 
and . 

The Fireman came in fast — but 
not nearly as fast as he should have 
done. Hasson experienced some- 
thing like a sense of luxury as he 
found himself with time to place his 
kick exactly where he wanted it. He 
chose the vulnerable point just be- 
low the visor, compensated for the 
abrupt drop which occurred as 
both CG fields cancelled out, and 
unleased enough energy to snap a 
man’s neck. Somehow the Fireman 
got his head out of the way in time 
and caught hold of Hasson’s out- 
stretched leg. Both men were 
falling now, but at an unequal rate 
because Hasson was tethered to 
Inglis whose CG field was too far 
away to have been cancelled. In the 
second before they parted the Fire- 
man applied the leverage of his 
massive arms and broke Hasson’s 
leg sideways at the knee. 

Pain and shock obliterated Has- 
son’s mind, gutting him of all 
strength and resolve. He floated in 
the blackness for an indeterminate 
period, arms moving uncertainly, 
face contorted in a silent scream. 
The great spiral nebula far below 
continued to spin, but a dark shape 
was moving steadily across it, and 



36 



IF 




part of Hasson’s mind informed 
him that there was not. time for in- 
dulgence in natural reactions to in- 
jury. He was hopelessly outclassed 
on the physical level and if life were 
to continue it would only be through 
the exercise of intelligence. But 
how was he to think when pain had 
invaded his body like an army and 
was firing mortar shells of agony 
straight into his brain? 

For a start , Hasson told himself, 
you have to get rid of Lloyd Inglis. 
He began reeling in his comrade’s 
body with the intention of unhook- 
ing it, but almost immediately the 
Fireman spoke from close behind 
him. 

“How did you like it, Hasson?’’ 
The voice was triumphant. “That 
was to show you I can beat you at 
your own game. Now we’re going to 
play my game.” 

Hasson tried drawing the line in 
faster. Inglis’s body bobbed closer 
and finally came within interference 
radius. Hasson and Inglis began to 
fall. The Fireman dived in on them 
on the instant, hooked an arm 
around Hasson’s body, and all 
three dropped together. The whirl- 
pool of fire began to expand be- 
neath them. 

“This is my game,’’ the Fireman 
sang through the gathering slip- 
stream. 4 7 can ride you all the way 
to the ground , 'cause I'm the Fire- 
man. " 

Hasson knew the tactics of aerial 
chicken. He shut out the pain from 
his trailing leg, reached for his 



master switch, but hesitated with- 
out throwing it. In two-man chicken 
the extinguishing of one CG field 
restored the other one to its normal 
efficacy, causing a fierce differen- 
tial which tended to drag one 
opponent vertically away from the 
other. The standard countermove 
was for the second man to kill his 
own field at the same time so that 
both bodies would continue to 
plunge downwards together until 
somebody’s nerve broke and forced 
him to reactivate his harness. In the 
present game of death, however, 
the situation was complicated by 
the presence of Inglis — the silent 
partner who had already lost. His 
field would continue negating those 
of the other two, regardless of what 
they did, unless . 

Hasson freed an arm from the 
Fireman’s mock-sexual embrace 
and pulled Inglis’s body in close. 
He groped for the dead man’s 
master switch but found only a 
smooth placque of frozen blood. 
The jewelled horizons were rising 
rapidly on all sides now and the 
circling traffic stream was opening 
like a carnivorous flower. Air rush- 
ed by at terminal velocity, deaf- 
eningly. Hasson fought to break the 
icy casting away from the switch on 
Inglis’s harness, but at that mo- 
ment the Fireman slid an arm 
around his neck and pulled his 
head back. 

“Don’t try^o get away from me,” 
he shouted into Hasson’s ear. 
“Don’t try to chicken out — I want 



A LITTLE NIGHT FLYING 



37 




to see how well you bounce.” 

They continued to fall. 

Hasson, encumbered by his nets, 
felt for the towline dispenser. He 
fumbled it open with numb fingers 
and was about to release Inglis’s 
body when it occurred to him he 
would gain very little in doing so. 
An experienced chicken player al- 
ways delayed breaking out of field 
interference until the last possible 
instant, leaving it so late that even 
with his harness set at maximum 
lift he hit the ground at the highest 
speed he could withstand. The Fire- 
man probably intended going to the 
limit this time, leaving Hasson too 
disabled to prevent himself being 
smashed on impact. Getting rid of 
Inglis’s body would not change 
that. 

They had dropped almost two 
thousand meters and in just a few 
seconds would be penetrating the 
crowded commuter levels. The Fire- 
man began to whoop with excite- 
ment, grinding himself against 
Hasson like a rutting dog. Holding 
Inglis with his left hand, Hasson 
used his right to loop the plasteel 
towline around the Fireman’s up- 
raised thigh and to pull it into a 
hard knot. He was still tightening 
the knot as they bombed down into 
the traffic flow. Lights flashed past 
nearby and suddenly the slow-spin- 
ning galaxy was above them. Pat- 
terns of street lamps blossomed be- 
neath. This, Hasson knew, was 
close to the moment at which the 
Fireman had to break free if he was 



to shed enough downward velocity 
before reaching ground level. 

“Thanks for the ride,” the Fire- 
man shouted, his voice ripping 
away in the slipstream. “Got to 
leave you soon.” 

Hasson switched on his flares 
and then jerked the towline violent- 
ly, bringing it to the Fireman’s at- 
tention. The Fireman looked at the 
loop around his thigh. His body 
convulsed with shock as he made 
the discovery that it was he and not 
Hasson who was linked to the dead 
and deadly sTcycop. He pushed Has- 
son away and began to claw at the 
line. Hasson swam free in the wind, 
knowing that the line would resist 
even the Fireman’s giant strength. 
As he felt his CG field spread its in- 
visible wings he turned to look 
back. He saw the two bodies, one of 
them struggling frantically, pass 
beyond the range of his flares on 
their way to a lethal impact with the 
ground. 

Hasson had no time to waste in 
introspection — his own crash land- 
ing was about to occur and it would 
require all his skill and experience 
to get him through it alive — but he 
was relieved to find that he could 
derive no satisfaction from the Fire- 
man’s death. Nunn and the others 
were wrong about him. 

Even so. he thought, during the 
final hurtling seconds. I've hunted 
like a hawk for far too long. This is 
mv last flight. 

He prepared himself, unafraid, 
for the earth’s blind embrace.

PROLOGUE 



Dear Isaac, 

Enclosed is a short piece which I 
thought you might find amusing. 
Of course the resolution is a bit 
flawed, but, well . If*you, Dr. 
A., revised the last three para- 
graphs or so, you would a) help 
create a Genuine Literary Curi- 
osity, b) nudge a trufan over the 
line into the ranks of Published 
Writers, and c) blow said fan’s 
mind clean out the window! You 
would also make me a very happy 
editor. 

By the way, your Forum piece for 
July Galaxy is even perfecter than I 
expected! 

All the best, 
(signed) Jim Baen 

Dear Jim, 

Okay, here is all the stuff you 
sent me, together with an alternate 
ending that I made up. 

Perhaps you can also get Bob Sil- 
verberg to make up an alternate 
ending — or at the very least make 
sure that he doesn’t get mad. (He 
didn't get mad. Ed.) 

And however much young J. S. 
Hudson may approve, I think it 
would be nice if you check with 
him, as a courtesy. 

Naturally, I don’t expect to be 
paid for this. If you run it, give all 
the money to Hudson. 

Yours,

Dear Jeff, 

Would you mind having your

A gurgling boil shook the waters 
„ of New York Bay. The misty 
air swirled and parted, revealing a 
great metal curve lying low in the 
water. A few yards away the water 
thrashed, and a huge white slick 
floated to the surface. The Navy, 
Coast Guard, and NYPD rushed 
out to investigate. As the last fog 
cleared off, aerial photographs were 
taken by the Air Force and the TV 
networks. 

The shiny metal curve rose slowly 
to a low peak, then dropped off 
quickly into the bay. It had a slight 
twist. All in all, it resembled a 
hump. The thrashing continued 
nearby, occasionally sending water 
plumes high into the air. The slick 
remained remarkably angular. The 
Pentagon couldn’t make head nor

tail of it but assumed everyone that 
it wasn’t the Russians. 

Then it happened. As if some- 
thing had been cut loose from 
below, the curve rose into the air, 
revealing itself to be a low arch, no, 
it didn’t connect to anything on one 
end. Two huge marginal stops 
reared their heads above the waves, 
and abruptly it surfaced. Water 
poured from the platen, splashed in 
the carriage, cascaded down the 
keyes and the mighty typewriter 
rose into the sunlight. The huge 
type faces arched skyward and 
whacked against the paper, the 
tabulator key was pressed and the 
cylinder knobs raced through the 
air, knocking over the Statue of 
Liberty. On the back of the Mighty 
Machine read the legend “World’s 
Most Prolific or Bust!’’ 

And down among the keys, rac- 
ing back and forth on a series of 
catwalks with a maniac fury, was 
Dr. Isaac Asimov. 

The President was outraged. 

The publisher was overjoyed. 

The public was hysterical. 

Meanwhile, the Good Doctor 
was typing away on an endless sheet 
of “paper’’ one hundred yards wide 
that seemed to materialize within 
the machine itself. Indeed, no part 
of the machine ever needed replac- 
ing, it seemed to be self-renewing. 
This included Doctor Asimov. The 
only clue to the typewriter’s mys- 
terious operation was a long electric 
cord that trailed out into the At- 
lantic. 



Isaac pounded out his message 
twenty-four hours a day. His mas- 
sive MS. had already clogged New 
York Harbor, and was now piling 
up on shore, curling around docks, 
gift wrapping high rises, paving the 
streets with the seemingly inde- 
structable “paper”. The letters did 
not blur or fade; whole crowds were 
seen walking down the paper pave- 
ment, reading in fascination. 

The works were on every subject 
imaginable. Science: a new Theory 
of Relativity. Humor: The City of 
New York nearly died laughing. 
Fiction: A new trilogy (Science 
Fiction, of course). 

The Mayor rowed out in a dinghy 
to try and talk Asimov into laying 
off for a while. Isaac listened to 
him, hitting the G, racing up 
underneath the Y, U, I, and pounc- 
ing on the O. He told the Mayor a 
funny joke and continued with his 
work. 

Various other officials rowed out 
to plead with him but got nowhere. 
Friends and relatives, fellow scien- 
tists and writers, all attempted to 
dissuade him, but to no avail. He 
was offered immense sums of money 
and didn’t even blink. 

The Science Fiction Writers of 
America promised to give up their 
trade, en masse. No good. The 
World Science Fiction Convention 
offered him a special Hugo Award 
as “World’s Greatest and Most 
Prolific Writer and Nicest Guy in 
the Cosmos.’’ Fiddlesticks, said 
Asimov. 



HALF BAKED PUBLISHER’S DELIGHT

By now, the monsterous MS. had 
spread across New York State in a 
broad white swath — having the 
most interesting effect on Niagara 
Falls — crossed Lake Erie (if that 
didn’t stop it, what could?) and 
tied Detroit in knots — literally. 

xr about this time, a mighty roar, 
XjL a colossal splash, and out of 
San Francisco Bay emerged yet 
another giant typewriter. 

As the spray cleared, there stood 
the figure of Robert Silverberg, a 
dark glint in his eastward gazing 
eyes, water dripping from his long 
hair and beard. In his hand he held 
a long pole and he explained (while 
demonstrating) that by pole vault- 
ing between the keys he expected to 
surpass Asimov. 

Another set of type faces whack- 
ed twenty-four hours a day; once 
more, miles of indestructable MS. 
This time it was the Bay Bridge that 
got knocked over. 

And so began the Great Race. 
Hank Aaron was forgotten over- 
night, and the Americans, being a 
sporting people, started rooting for 
one or the other. Attempts at pla- 
cation were abandoned — for what 
one-of-a-kind honor could be grant- 
ed twice? However, lesser honors 
rained down, in order to show af- 
fection and confidence in one or the 
other of the two. Silverberg was 
voted Best Dressed Science Fiction 
Writer. Asimov turned down a 
presidential bid. Neither bothered 
more than a blink with all the silly 



business and continued typing at a 
tremendous pace. Asimov, in order 
to speed up production, created a 
Tarzanic arrangements so he could 
swing from key to key. But in so 
doing, he lost valuable time to 
Silverberg, whose pole vaulting was 
exquisite. 

Asimov’s MS. had by now cross- 
ed the Mississippi and was currently 
burying Mount Rushmore. Silver- 
berg’s, after some initial difficulties 
in the Grand Canyon, was ram- 
paging into the Great Plains. 

Then, for reasons unbeknownst 
to man, the two MSS. changed di- 
rection and proceeded on a collision 
course. It became apparent that 
this blessed event would occur in 
the Cornhusker State of Nebraska. 
Many bets were placed on the out- 
come of the meeting of the minds. 
The Big Question was “Which is 
stronger?!’’ 

Publishers cashed in on the free 
publicity, printing and reprinting 
as cleaned out book stores demand- 
ed more and more. Huge fan clubs 
were formed, offering fake beards 
and wigs (just like Silverberg’s!) 
Asimov’s fans tended to dress as 
robots, wearing “Mule-ears ? ’ for 
less formal occasions.

The big day came. The two paper 
snakes approached, raised their 
heads, and coiled together into a 
spiral. 

For a day, they held together 
trembling in a double helix of 
paper, while more paper accumu- 
lated beneath. Then the two coils 
drew apart, peeling away, and out 
of the air molecules about, each 
formed a new coil of paper. Where 
one double helix had existed a 
while before, two now existed in 
perfect replication. 

Reporters dropped their micro- 
phones. 

Government agents dropped 
their listening devices. 

The American public dropped its 
collective lower jaw. 



Another day the two double 
helices held together trembling, 
then drew apart, peeling away — 
and there were four. 

In the Atlantic and in the Pacific, 
each endless sheaf of paper pulled 
out of the gigantic typewriter with a 
horrendous tear. The keys of each 
locked in place with a thunderous 
snap. Asimov fell back, gibbering. 
Silverberg tumbled forward, yam- 
mering. 

In Nebraska, the paper helices 
continued to separate and repli- 
cate. The monster no longer needed 
its Frankensteins. 

NASA estimates that in less than 
two months, all the Earth will be 
paper. Perhaps it will then reach 
for the Moon. •

EDITORIAL 

ON THE URBANIZATION 
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM 

A few months ago I had occasion to attend the Northeastern U.S. 
SF Convention (BOSKONE) where I had the good fortune to hear a 
talk on space flight reaction-drives given by Dr. Robert Enzmann, a 
physicist working at Northeast Cryonics, Inc. In this talk Dr. 
Enzmann discussed in nuts-and-bolts terms the construction of a 
vehicle capable of making the round-trip to Pluto in under eight 
weeks. He was not talking about “theoretical innovations just over 
the horizon of today’s technology,” but of (relatively) simple Apollo- 
style R&D; the mating of shuttlecraft technology with the results of 
vacuum-based pulse-fusion research. I should also mention that Dr. 
Enzmann was referring to vehicles of virtually any size payload- 
capacity and payload-costs in the range of pennies-per-pound at 
point of delivery. 

During the question-and-answer session that followed I asked Dr. 
Enzmann, “If you were to be given — today — five billion dollars and 
the Directorship of NASA, how long would it take you to achieve an 
operational pulse-fusion driven space vehicle with the performance 
characteristics you describe?” Dr. Enzmann replied very simply: 
“Three to five years.” Given a more ordinary course of events, he 
told me, we can expect to have such vehicles within 10 to 15 years. 

A month or so later I was discussing possible science-fact articles 
with science- writer Dick Hoagland (who has been, among other 
things, Science Advisor to Walter Cronkite, Project Scientist to the 
first woman to fly solo across the North Pole, and one of the creators 
of the so-called Pioneer- 10 plague) when I discovered to my delight, 
that he and Dr. Enzmann are old friends. One result of this dis- 
covery was a two-part science feature, done in the form of a 
dialogue, entitled TORCHSHIPS NOW! The conversation therein 
depicted, while obviously highly edited, did in essence take place one 
cold New England night, or on a succession of such nights. The 
other result was that, as of this issue, Dick is Science Editor of 
Worlds of IF. 

Welcome, Dick! — Baen

TORCHSHIPS NOW! 

ROBERT D. ENZMANN & 
RICHARD C. HOAGLAND 



i 

I T is a setting reasonably improb- 
able for the discussion of a 
breakthrough which is destined to 
change Civilization. We are in the 
living room of the first author of 
this narrative, a room furnished in 
Danish Modern, lots of children, 
and an insatiable Fireplace from 
which protrudes a seven-foot log. It 
is evening and the curtains are 
drawn, creating a sense of cloister 
from the world outside while the 
talk within ranges the Universe . 

We are a sizeable group, some 
sitting on chairs, some on the floor, 
the second author of this article 
balancing the irrepressible Heidi 
Enzmann (eight years) on one knee 
while attempting, simultaneously, 
to balance a cup of tea on the other. 
In a corner of the long couch, Bob’s 



wife, Josie — mathematician extra- 
ordinaire — is quietly sitting doing 
needlepoint; a couple of unexpected 
drop-in guests from a commune in 
Vermont, the children, and our 
host complete the group. 

Strategically positioned beside 
the hearth (on which old toothpaste 
tubes are in the process of being 
magically transformed into lead 
soldiers) is the head of this unusual 
household — geologist, explorer, 

historian, physicist, project engi- 
neer, arid dreamer — looking com- 
fortable, albeit a bit drafty about 
the knees, in a very faded pair of 
ancient blue denim bermudas and 
a somewhat lumpy woolen pullover. 

Periodically, adjustment is made 
to the contents of the fireplace. The 
ritual consists of shoving in another 
foot or so of the long log protruding 
into the room, and adding various 




other ingredients to encourage com- 
bustion, such as the contents of 
many wastebaskets which appear 
from other rooms. (The entire 
house is a warren of desk corners 
and bookshelves — in the hallways, 
in bedrooms, the basement, up 
under the eaves.) 

HOAGLAND: Robert, you and I 
have shared a unique privilege in 
being on the inside of events which 
have played a key role in shaping 
the future history of this planet. In 
fact, you have enjoyed a few more 
years of privilege than I by virtue of 
the fact that you started sooner. Ig- 
noring that unfair advantage for 
the moment, we’ve experienced the 
latest of these turning points — the 
Space Age — and have even manag- 
ed to raise a little dust over its im- 
portance, here and there. But here 
is a question: where did we fail? 

Kidding aside, what went wrong? 
The human race has dreamed of 
leaving Earth all the way back to 
Lucian of Samasatos. I’d even be 
willing to bet that someone in the 
crowd which spent a sizeable per- 
centage of its GNP on Stonehenge 
may have wondered if the moon, 
instead of being a god, wasn’t an- 
other world. The dream is old! 

And yet, here we are, with six 
flags standing on the surface of an- 
other planet, a bevy of craft send- 
ing back fantastic pictures of places 
that we have known all our lives 
only as points of light in the sky, 
with even a message on its way to 



the “galactics,” whoever and where 
ever they may be . 

ENZMANN: Inspired by you . 
[Dick has been referred to as a 
“midwife of the Pioneer 10 
plaque . ” Baen] 

HOAGLAND: Partly, yes. Yet, 
in spite of all this accomplishment 
and effort and physical return, the 
reaction to this amazing series of 
miracles is, “So what?” Where did 
we go wrong? 

Hundreds of thousands of people 
avidly read science fiction, are 
turned on about the Future, and 
there is even a growing number who 
feel, however misguidedly, that the 
planets are somehow involved with 
their daily lives and where they are 
going or have come from. What 
happened to this diverse base of 
support for space travel? Where 
and when did it evaporate? 

I can tell you how we lost them, 
the great American public. We 
failed through success. We were too 
perfect: not a man was lost in 
space. That was the first factor. I 
was in space headquarters at CBS 
during the Flight of Apollo 13. The 
world hung on every breath, every 
creak of the aluminum foil skin of 
the LM as it fell back toward Earth, 
running out of power, out of water, 
freezing cold, unable to perform 
even simple navigation. Would they 
incinerate on re-entry from too 
steep an angle, or would they skip 
off into deep space to die of suffo- 
cation? Lovell’s determined line 



46 



IF 




against the omnipresent static of 
air-to-ground, . better to bias 
it for a steeper angle than to skip. 
We’re all agreed up here . we’re 
coming home!” 

The world ate it up: the net- 
works, the newspapers, the wire 
services, and the public. The whole 
planet, more people than had ever 
cared for three human beings in the 
entire history of the earth, literally 
“rode” that spacecraft back from 
the jaws of death. They cared. It 
wasn’t a horrible spectator sport 
such as you see in some dramatic 
life-and-death events, like the guy 
on a ledge where somebody shouts, 
“Jump!” No; it was everyone’s jeo- 
pardy and in the end we all shared 
the victory. The telegrams, the 
phone calls, the letters — all indi- 
cated a deep concern, a recognition 
that these guys were in deep 
trouble. The messages poured in: 
offerings of advice, of aid and 
money for the wives, anything to 
help in a time of need. Underlying 
it all, moreover, was something 
much more significant, something 
which made me realize where we in 
the space business went wrong. 

Apollo 13 occurred in the after- 
math of the brilliant and redundant 
successes of Apollos 8, 9, 10, 11, 
and 12. There was a wave of re- 
action building, spelled out in the 
phrase, ”... all that money, for a 
bunch of rocks?" Space appropria- 
tions, particularly the money allo- 
cated for Apollos 18, 19, and 20, 
had just then been, or were about 



to be, cut. Ecology was big and 
growing as the new national preoc- 
cupation. But . 

When three guys, engaged in “a 
wasteful, silly, and horribly expen- 
sive use of public money” found 
themselves in severe and highly 
visible jeopardy, with about an even 
chance of buying it halfway between 
Earth and the moon; the first, pos- 
sibly, to sacrifice their lives in 
space, the effect was magical. 

Not one commentator, editorial, 
or story that I saw during or after 
that interminable wait for their re- 
turn suggested that they were about 
to, or would have died, in vain. 
They were bona fide heroes, giving 
their lives (if the worst happened) 
while engaged in an activity which 
was to advance the entire human 
race. Or so the reaction seemed to 
imply. Even people who were not 
extraordinarily articulate seemed to 
have a gut feeling that these guys 
were important, that their dying or 
danger of dying meant something. 
Not even the severest critics of the 
space program accused the Apollo 
13 crew of throwing away their lives 
on a pointless exercise. 

This drama of a real confronta- 
tion with possible death in space, 
rather than causing a backlash 
against the value of space explora- 
tion, seemed to bring out the 
hidden feelings of an awful lot of 
people that these guys were impor- 
tant because, somehow, they were 
working for a tomorrow for all of 
us. 



TORCHSHIPS, NOW! 



47 




The price of winning the moon, 
rather than being too High, wasn’t 
high enough. Our conquest of an- 
other world was not paid for by the 
life of a single flying astronaut. 
And, as a human measure of value, 
was therefore a “cheap” thrill. Af- 
ter all, when you’re spending bil- 
lions, whq counts the money? Con- 
trast these 20 billions (total cost) to 
get to the moon with the 27 millions 
per day for approximately ten years 
(80 billions) for military expendi- 
ture in one area, alone; and add to 
this cost, for the same fateful 
decade, the enormous expenditure 
of life in that area. Yes, we ac- 
quired the face of Luna far too 
easily to value its potential. 

Factor Number Two: We discov- 
ered a dead solar system, a system 
with an overwhelming tendency to- 
ward one morphological structure, 
craters. Craters and more craters; 
big craters, small craters; craters 
with rays and craters without rays; 
craters on what we had hoped was 
life-filled Mars; craters, of course, 
on the moon; craters under the for- 
ever veiling clouds of Venus, and 
craters, also, smothering the sur- 
face of a planet no human eye had 
ever seen — Mercury. Too many 
craters and too little prospect for 
living things in the rest of the sun’s 
family helped to kill interest in 
space. Particularly those craters on 
Mars. 

Mars, as a bigger version of the 
lifeless moon, was probably the 
coup de grace to public interest in 



exploring the solar system. By the 
time the exciting, wonderful news 
was relayed back by Mariner 9 that 
Mars was apparently a world 
asleep, locked in a glacial age 
awaiting the warmth of a 50,000 
year old spring to awaken it, it was 
too late. Nobody was listening. 

Factor Number Three involved 
technical necessity. Space travel 
was too exclusive. NASA was forced 
to pick as astronauts guys with tol- 
erances, reflexes, and piloting skills 
that make the rest of us look like re- 
jects from the Pleiocene. In any 
human activity where only a very 
limited number can directly partici- 
pate it is important to establish an 
identification of the audience with 
The participants. Who can relate to 
Superman? 

Of necessity, the beginning of 
spaceflight built up the image of an 
extraordinarily dangerous, very ex- 
clusive activity which was unlikely 
ever to be a profession open to the 
“average” person. And who, at 
that point, wanted it, with exquisite 
delights ranging all the way from 
exploding to drowning or being 
crushed to death during re-entry if 
you were able to qualify? 

American interest in the space 
program was killed, then by a com- 
bination of boredom, disappoint- 
ment, and eliteism. Even for science 
fiction fans it was hard to imagine 
space opening up very soon to the 
average Joe. Oh, and one more 
thing: spaceflight was a public ex- 
penditure. In the minds of the pub- 



48 



IF 




lie, it was money spent on one thing 
which couldn’t be spent on some- 
thing else. And as long, as there 
were other deserving programs in 
need of the “large sums’’ NASA 
was apparently receiving, even its 
supporters had to accent the im- 
mediate, practical benefits from 
space research. However — as we 
know — space is a long-term invest- 
ment, equivalent in many ways to 
our remote emergence from the 
sea, 600 million years ago. Try sell- 
ing that to a budget director at the 
General Accounting Office! 

Now that is all past. 

What of the present? Alas, as I 
see it, from about ten years of grow- 
ing up with, in, and through the 
space program, Americans actually 
feel that our space explorations are 
essentially at an end. One very well- 
known TV space reporter was 
heard to remark recently, that “all 
the excitement is gone from space 
exploration. All that’s left now is to 
put up a few earth satellites to work 
on inventorying our dwindling re- 
sources!” 

all this is about to change. And 
/iL you, Robert, are partially re- 
sponsible. Tell us what is about to 
happen to turn this dismal state of 
affairs completely around! 

ENZMANN: Simple. Mankind, 
in its current awareness of a fossil 
fuel energy crisis, is about to tame 
the first inexhaustible resource in 
its history — the power of the stars — 
thermonuclear fusion. When that 



happens, sometime around 1976, 
we (those of us who see beyond the 
enormous immediate benefit to 
Earth) will use this energy as the 
means of opening up total explora- 
tion and development of the solar 
system to all levels of society. And 
some of us, myself among them, 
look even beyond our solar system, 
to the stars themselves! 

For the first time, aerospace, 
rather than being the source of 
spin-off benefits to the culture, will 
be the recipient. The greatly ac- 
celerated attention and funding of 
various thermonuclear fusion pro- 
grams due to national awareness of 
an energy “crisis” will result in the 
creation of fusion rocket-engines 
with efficiencies and capabilities 
which will seem almost magical to 
those raised on chemical rocket 
technology. 

This must happen. It is inevi- 
table. As long as there is funding of 
fusion research and development 
for the unlimited generation of elec- 
tric power, there will be, simultan- 
eously, development of fusion 
rocket systems. As this develop- 
ment progresses — years before we 
have a practical means of generat- 
ing electricity from fusion — we 
shall have crude fusion rockets 
(probably in the late ’70’s or early 
’80’s) created as “by-products” of 
the main objective, which is un- 
limited power for our terrestrial so- 
ciety. With fusion rockets and the 
Torchships of Robert Heinlein’s 
prophetic imagination, the skies 



TORCHSHIPS, NOW! 



49 




are literally opened to acquisition 
of the solar system and the stars. 

HOAGLAND: Then the key to 
the future of space lies in the fund- 
ing levels for fusion, made by the 
U.S. Energy Office, now! . 

ENZMANN: ... and in the 
awareness of every environmentalist 
that, directly and indirectly, fusion 
power will result in a restoration of 
the green garden, Earth. 

HOAGLAND: How many do you 
think are aware of what is about to 
happen, both to our energy needs 
here and in the extraterrestrial con- 
text? 

ENZMANN: Too few. This is 
still a society in which you can 
achieve almost any objective, pro- 
vided you know what you want and 
are aware of how to go about at- 
taining it. Too few people realize 
how close we are to the solution of 
this, perhaps, ultimate technical 
goal: unlimited, pollutionless ener- 
gy; or of what is application, par- 
ticularly in the area of spaceflight 
will mean, even within a few years 
of tonight. 

HOAGLAND: This is incredible. 

ENZMANN: But there is even 
more to come. It seems probable 
that, as research progresses in the 
construction of practical fusion 
power plants, there will come a 
point where the Energy Office and 
NASA seek some sort of coopera- 
tive liaison. That is, beyond a cer- 
tain point, research and develop- 
ment of fusion technology might 
just be more economical if carried 



out in space , in near earth orbit, 
rather than on the ground. 

Without going into elaborate de- 
tail on the history of fusion research 
in the United States^ over the last 
twenty years, suffice to say there 
has been slow but steady progress. 
The primary stumbling blocks have 
been in heating and confining a 
plasma composed of electrically 
neutral ionised electrons and nuclei 
within chambers which have to be 
almost perfect vacuums before, 
during, and after the reaction. The 
very nature of a fusion reaction 
tends to mess up a vacuum cham- 
ber with a quantity of non-essential 
plasma. And in all approaches, a 
good — ultra- good — vacuum is one 
absolutely essential element in at- 
taining fusion. 

Now, down here, under our ever- 
present sea of air, making and 
holding good vacuum is only a little 
bit easier than balancing the 
Federal budget- — and almost as ex- 
pensive. It seems a good bet, as de- 
velopmental hardware gets bigger 
and usable power levels grow, that 
someone is going to take an HP- 
35 or Bomar (or even an old-fash- 
ioned slide rule) and discover that 
an economical fusion electrical 
power plant doesn’t belong on the 
surface of the earth, at all. 

And that will leave space as the 
solution. 

HOAGLAND: Right. We have 
an energy crisis looking for a solu- 
tion. Waiting in the wings is solu- 
tion with a capital “S” — namely, 



50 



IF 




thermonuclear fusion energy which 
will ultimately be brought on line 
for electrical power applications 
within twenty years. 

ENZMANN: Ah . yes. 

HOAGLAND: In addition to 
other interim energy solutions, 
fusion research is currently being 
funded and will increase as the 
years roll by. O.K. At some point it 
is realized that practical fusion 
plants require testing in really good 
vacuums . no, are more eco- 
nomical in an environment where 
an unlimited vacuum is always 
available. 

Also by the end of this decade — 
sooner if funding can be increas- 
ed — the Shuttle will be on line. We 
marry the Shuttle with the fusion 
research and development, and we 
get, long before a commercial elec- 
trical generator powered by a 
fusion-reactor . 

ENZMANN: . the first fusion 
rocket systems! Power-system tests 
conducted in near Earth orbit dem- 
onstrate the ease and economy of 
propelling spacecraft via fusion 
technology. In fact, it seems prob- 
able that before 1980 a fusion-en- 
gine powered probe will be launch- 
ed in this manner. The Era of the 
Torchship will have dawned. 

HOAGLAND: And we are so 
close, a few years, a decade. What’s 
that, compared to the history of the 
dream? 

ENZMANN: The distance be- 
tween the fabric-covered aircraft of 
the 30’ s and the magnificent Apollo 



Project is surely greater than the 
distance between the first manned 
expedition to the Moon and the 
first voyage to the stars. 

To say that, is one thing. But to 
realize, that because of the explo- 
sion of effort going on in this area I 
shall probably live to see it is an- 
other . And it is wonderful! 

T he fire needed tending. How 
many hearths had been ringed 
at night across the span of human 
consciousness by how many genera- 
tions of storytellers? Each with an 
audience, each with a tale, each 
lighted by the flickering warmth of 
Man’s first Promethian accom- 
plishment. And now, so soon, the 
fire of the Universe itself, the ther- 
monuclear inferno of a captive star 
would be loosed to warm how many 
future generations of future story- 
tellers assembled . where? One 
thing was certain: some of them 
would be a long way from this quiet 
New England town of Lexington, 
Massachusetts. History is full of 
ironies. Once before, this had been 
the setting for a shot heard round 
the world. 

ENZMANN: To give appropriate 
perspective to this development 
several things should be considered. 
The first is the ever-growing avail- 
ability of goods and services, a 
growth which, even in my lifetime, 
has been spectacular. I remember 
the clip-clop of horses in the streets 
of Bath, Maine. I remember black- 
smiths. I can still recapture the 



TORCHSHfPS, NOW! 



SI 




wonder of running out to see an 
automobile. Can you imagine how 
many “blacksmiths” it would have 
taken to create just one of the cars 
out there on the driveway, cars 
which have carried one of you al- 
most a hundred miles this evening, 
and you two all the way from North- 
ern Vermont? We take the automo- 
bile for granted. Those who cannot 
afford one, even a small one, we 
somehow think of as underprivileg- 
ed. And yet, consider the wealth 
necessary to own just one car, let 
alone create the tens of millions 
sold each year in the United States 
alone. 

The exploration of space is con- 
sidered an expensive luxury today 
by some. But expense is relative. 
Even now we are spending less than 
one percent of our GNP on this ac- 
tivity, and already the return, in the 
form of satellite communications 
systems, earth resources informa- 
tion, and basic new science, has 
more than paid for the initial ex- 
penditure. 

Any human activity which results 
in an increase of productivity must 
be considered a source and not a 
sink, as space has erroneously been 
viewed by some. When we think of 
spaceships and their cost in the 
future, we must think, not only of 
the generally rising wealth of the 
world, but also of the sharply rising 
contribution to this wealth which 
will be made by those ships and the 
space effort as a whole. 

Wealth comes down to three 



basic things: energy, resources, and 
information. With successful con- 
trol of the first (fusion), the second 
item (resources) becomes almost 
academic. Fusion power will allow 
refining of ores which are now too 
poor to be profitable. And with 
fusion the recycling of anything is 
literally as easy as shoving the item 
into the 100,000,000 degree plas- 
ma, and magnetically separating 
out each isotope in pure form, for 
use again. 

But it is the third item, informa- 
tion, which is our real wealth. Our 
total science, our technological 
“how-to” bank, is also increasing 
at a phenomenal rate all over the 
world. It is “know-how” which will 
allow us to focus the previous two 
items, energy and resources, on the 
alleviation of human need and the 
meeting of rising world aspirations. 

The true value of the space effort 
during the past 15 years has been in 
the expansion of that “how-to” 
data base for future operations. We 
have acquired data which includes 
basic new information on the 
planets; the technology of space 
systems (how hardware “lives” in 
the space environment); and the 
capabilities of Man — how he lives 
and performs in space and on an- 
other planet. Now, imagine where 
we would stand if, suddenly, armed 
with a fusion drive, we had to dis- 
cover or acquire all this data “over- 
night.” 

HOAGLAND: There are those 
who believe, even with the space 



52 



IF 




shuttle, that America’s era of space 
exploration is over, that we have 
witnessed the last excitement of 
men walking on another world and 
of pictures relayed back from places 
no human eye had ever seen before. 
What you are describing is the 
veritable lull before the storm, the 
micro-shock before the earthquake, 
the hush just before the blinding 
light of another dawn . 

ENZMANN: It is the dawn. 
Mankind is about to emerge from 
its long night of infancy into the 
steady sunlight that forever fills the 
vast spaces of the solar system. It is 
the beginning of our first new day 
amid the wonders of the sun. A 
further part of our perspective 
should be historical. There are 
ideas which have their times and 
this is usually because they make 
economic sense. Many people be- 
moan the end of the Apollo Project; 
they shouldn’t, any more than they 
mourn the passing of Gemini, 
Mercury, or the propeller-driven 
aircraft which took 14 noisy hours 
to cross the Atlantic. Systems de- 
velop. In any such endeavors, there 
are false starts, premature starts, 
blind alleys, and restarts. Look at 
the zeppelin, the DOX Hying boat, 
floating islands proposed in the 
’30’s to aid trans-atlantic air ser- 
vice and, perhaps, current tech- 
niques for cryogenic suspension of 
“chrononauts.” 

It is not the systems that are im- 
portant. They are like species 
blown before the winds of evolu- 



tion. It is only objectives which 
matter in the long run. My back- 
ground is technological and limit- 
ed. It is currently directed toward 
the practical realization of electri- 
cal power generation through the 
achievement of thermonuclear 
fusion. My avocation and dearest 
wish is to see that power applied to 
the realization of manned star- 
ships. It has been my dream for 
decades; a dream which, at last, 
seems to be on the verge of reali- 
zation. 

HOAGLAND: I can’t help 
thinking that we are roughly equiv- 
alent, historically speaking, to that 
period just before general accept- 
ance of the Coper nican world view. 
There are a lot of people, in fact, I 
would venture to say most people, 
who view space activities as a trivial 
government activity, harmless at 
best, wasteful of taxpayers’ money 
at worst; but totally disconnected 
from our lives and the future of our 
planet. In terms of consciousness, 
we aren’t actually in the Space Age 
at all, yet! 

E nzmann: We are all prisoners 
of our perspectives on the 
world. To most people, spaceflight 
is the Apollo Project, complete with 
its gargantuan facilities, its spec- 
tacular departures, and its incred- 
ible price tag. No wonder that, in 
the public mind, spaceflight is an 
expensive luxury. Even those more 
sophisticated may have difficulty in 
putting into appropriate context 



TORCHSHIPS, NOW!

the promise of recent developments. 
Therefore, it may be relevant to 
consider some alternate space 
transportation systems and their 
relative merits. 

To make things interesting, let 
us normalize all systems against the 
ultimate technical problem: flight 
to the stars. 

Chemical Rockets . Transit times 
to the nearer stars, several light 
years distant: 4,000 years (186 
miles/sec) to 400 years (1860 miles/ 
sec) 

(Interstellar probes could con- 
ceivably be attempted with chemi- 
cal systems, although the size, com- 
plexity, and quantity of propellant 
would beggar the imagination. As 
reference, we have sent forth our 
first interstellar emissaries, Pio- 
neers 10 and 11. Pioneer 10 will 
transit the interstellar gulf at about 
7 miles/sec, with a flight time of 
about 80,000 years to the distance 
of the nearest star (toward which, 
incidentally, it is not targeted). Not 
much scaling is necessary to see 
that a chemical flight to Proxima 
Centuri with a huge generation 
ship, while possible, is the least 
likely way in which well make “the 
crossing.”] 

Ion Propulsion . Transit times of 
3,000 to 200 years: velocities com- 
parable to those of chemical systems 

[The advantage of ion systems 
lies in the enormous increase of ef- 
ficiency with an associated decrease 
in the amount of propellant and, 



therefore, associated tankage, etc. 
When all the trade-offs are figured 
in, however, total trip time is about 
the same as with chemical rockets: 
your “world” is simply smaller and 
more manageable.] 

At this point, a footnote might be 
in order: No matter what the pro- 
pulsion mechanism, with flight 
times of the order of centuries, it is 
obvious that the most severe prob- 
lems for the intrepid voyagers is not 
propulsion but power. How do you 
heat an artificial world trillions of 
miles from the nearest heat source? 
How do you run computers, lights, 
air conditioning, sensors, and life 
support equipment, in general? 
Batteries? Even assuming fuel cells 
similar to those which powered the 
Service Module in Apollo, stop for 
a moment and just think of the 
amount of electrical energy and 
fuel required to keep a ship operat- 
ing for 3,000 years! 

It is apparent that serious con- 
sideration of starflight was not in 
the cards until the discovery of 
atomic energy. And at that tech- 
nical plateau, if you’re going to use 
the atom to produce electricity for 
accelerating charged ions to thrust 
a ship toward the stars, it becomes 
obvious that a more direct utiliza- 
tion of atomic energy might just 
make things a lot simpler. Could 
you, for instance, harness the rav- 
ening power of a fission chain re- 
action in a rocket engine, thus pro- 
ducing a true “atomic rocket,” for 



54 



IF 




a starship capable of actually visit- 
ing our neighboring suns in this 
galactic sector? 

The answer is: We tried. 

Nuclear Pulse Propulsion . Tran- 
sit times of 500 to 40 years: veloci- 
ties up to 1/10 speed of light. 

[Back in the days of Sputnik , 
when the name of the game was 
mass and brute force, a concept 
was developed for propelling space- 
ships that was compelling in its 
simplicity. It was named Orion , 
and it died in 1961 on the eve of 
handing mankind the solar system. 
Orion was based on the apparently • 
insane premise that the way to har- 
ness atomic energy in a rocket en- 
gine was to build a large ship and 
detonate a small atomic bomb in 
the chamber. What, at first glance, 
looked as if the design engineers 
needed a month or two under psy- 
chiatric care, turned out to be su- 
premely workable in practice. The 
key was scale.] 

Small “mini-fission” bombs were 
to be exploded inside a large, rein- 
forced rocket chamber, open at one 
end — reminiscent of a pot-bellied 
stove — and attached across a series 
of shock absorbers to the payload 
section, crew quarters, and control 
section of the ship. Exploded at the 
rate of one per second, the thrust of 
the expanding plasma escaping 
from the nozzle would propel the 
ship forward at between .1 and one 
“G.” (32 feet/sec 2 . None of this 
coasting nonsense; none of the hun- 



dreds of days drifting to Mars or 
Venus.) Later versions did away 
with the chamber, substituting a 
flat steel plate. The nuclear 
charges, shaped to direct the plas- 
ma toward the plate, were to be 
ejected behind the ship and deto- 
nated in a manner and at a rate 
similar to the chamber version. 

For those who have visions of 
pusher plate, ship, and crew being 
turned into a small nova upon the 
captain’s order to get underway, 
stop and think. In space, as on 
earth, the actual nuclear explosion 
lasts only millionths of a second. 
The first thing to hit the plate 
would have been the X-rays gener- 
ated by the fission process. (To get 
light you have to have the step- 
down effect of an atmosphere. No 
fireballs and mushroom clouds out 
there.) The X-rays absorbed by the 
plate would cause heating. Later, 
at much less than the speed of 
light, the primary energy transport 
mechanism of the bomb, the high 
temperature plasma of what used 
to be the uranium, the steel casing, 
triggering, circuits, etc., would hit 
the plate. It is this plasma impact 
that drives the ship forward. It also 
causes heating. But the sum of 
these two energy inputs to the 
plate, on calculation, is less than 
the energy necessary to heat, melt, 
and vaporize anything as massive 
and conducting as the pusher plates 
contemplated. And remember: at 
the rate of one explosion per sec- 
ond, the plate would have a million 



TORCHSHIPS, NOW! 



55 




times longer to cool, to radiate 
away excess energy, than the rate of 
input! It is quite analogous to the 
game of passing your finger through 
a candle flame. There is a rate at 
which you could do it all day. 
Simply a matter of calculation. 

The importance of this direct 
application of atomic fission to 
space propulsion was staggering. 
Test models, using dynamite 
charges in place of nuclear ex- 
plosives, worked beautifully. Shock 
absorbing systems, necessary to 
smooth out the percussive effect of 
a series of impulses to the plate, 
were designed and tested. The 
entire idea was actually quite simi- 
lar to that of an internal combus- 
tion engine, where a series of indi- 
vidual explosions in cylinders are 
forced to impart an even flow of 
power to the drive mechanism of 
the automobile. 

The potential of Orion is hard to 
underestimate. Ships were designed 
that could have made a manned 
Mars flight with 1,000 tons of sup- 
plies and 60 men, in three weeks! A 
hundred tons of samples, with 
crew, could have been returned in 
similar time. Another version could 
have made a manned flight to 
Pluto, with 30 men and 50 tons of 
supplies, in four weeks! Five tons of 
samples and crew could have come 
home in another month. Such a 
trip with chemical rockets similar 
to the Saturn V would take 45 years 
for a direct flight, one way. 

HOAGLAND: Let me under- 



stand this: Orion was a project 
funded by NASA, the Department 
of Defense, and several segments of 
private industry. It was examined, 
hardware built, models of the basic 
concept tested explosive propulsion 
with a shock-averaging mechan- 
ism), and projected mission specs 
written which would essentially 
have opened the solar system to us 
within a couple of decades, starting 
in the . 

ENZMANN: . late ’50’s. 

HOAGLAND: And it was can- 
celled? 

ENZMANN: Technically, Orion 
was sensational. Politically, it had 
one flaw: it required detonation of 
atomic bombs in space, an activity 
which we were anxiously seeking to 
detect and prevent, at that time. 
Orion became the prime casualty of 
the Test-ban Treaty with the 
U.S.S.R. History will decide which 
was more important to the future of 
the world — the first retreat from 
nuclear confrontation, evidenced 
by the Treaty, or the early acquisi- 
tion of the solar system which 
Orion would have made possible. It 
is conceivable that Orion could 
have lessened the pressure for nu- 
clear war by providing men access 
to the treasures of the solar system. 
It is just as conceivable that the na- 
tion producing such interplanetary 
craft could have dominated Earth, 
in which case war might have oc- 
curred in an attempt to prevent 
that political eventuality. We are 
treading on speculative ground

IF 




which I am not qualified to explore, 
much less provide detailed maps 
thereof. 

O rion could have made an in- 
terstellar transit at velocities 
appreciably close to that of light, 
up to one-third “C.” The higher ve- 
locities would have been used in 
simple fly-by missions, which are 
inherently much less expensive in 
terms of energy and fuel than 
capture missions. (You don’t have 
to decelerate.) Communications, 
even in the late ’50’s, would have 
presented no insurmountable diffi- 
culty, considering the mass we had 
to work with. It was estimated that 
simple TV frames could be return- 
ed from a depth of 250 light-years, 
using then-existent equipment. Re- 
liability and multiple redundancy 
were more of a problem for long 
missions lasting several decades. 
Remember, at that time we were 
studying unmanned interstellar 
probes that could easily reach their 
destinations within a single experi- 
menter’s lifetime. 

Orion had one other flaw. The 
ships themselves would have re- 
sembled boiler-plate freighters, and 
would have cost about the same 
(about a dollar per pound), which 
is way below current costs for aero- 
space vehicles. No, the expense of 
Orion was in its fuel. Atomic bombs 
even little ones, cost a lot of money 
to produce. Now, with breeder 
reactors that will produce surplus 
plutonium as a by-product of ef- 



forts to generate electricity, the cost 
of making the “bomblets” would 
probably be a tenth of what it was 
twenty years ago.] 

Here, Dr. Enzmann leaned for- 
ward to mend the fire. It flickered 
upward, sending sparks up the 
chimney and a warm light shone for 
a moment or two into his ordinarily 
austere and aquiline-featured 
countenance. The softening effect 
of the firelight matched his next 
musing words, the words of the 
creator spoken to his lost creation . 

“Alas, Orion , I loved you, and 
have been essentially alone in pub- 
licizing your existence. Instead of 
you, we’ve had Apollo — a safer 
course, perhaps, but not as grand. 
Across the years, when it was un- 
popular to mention your name, I 
lauded your abilities, such was my 
devotion to the idea that there 
existed an actual concept which 
could take men, en mass, beyond 
the earth. It was not the wisest of 
political decisions, but it was 
honest. How ironic that many of 
those who assisted at your birth, 
Orion, should now be in pursuit of 
an even grander means to that ob- 
jective — fusion — and all that it im- 
plies. The torch has now passed to 
your successor, but you will be re- 
membered by some of us as the 
first, Man’s earliest expression of 
an age-old longing in the night to 
reach out across the dark and toutdi 
the stars!’’

TORCHSHIPS, NOW!

T he children were playing six- 
point Overlord, hopping from 
point to point over a hexagonal dia- 
gram drawn in the sand, when the 
probe broke atmosphere over their 
heads. They might have sensed it 
then, for it was heating fast as it 
entered atmosphere; but nobody 
happened to look up. 

Seconds later the retrorocket 
fired. 

A gentle rain of infrared light 
bathed the limonite sands. Over 
hundreds of square miles of orange 
martian desert, wide-spaced clumps 
of black grass uncurled their leaves 
to catch and hoard the heat. Tiny 
sessile things buried beneath the 
sand raised fan-shaped probes. 

The children hadn’t noticed yet, 
but their ears were stirring. Their 
ears sensed heat rather than sound; 
unless they were listening to some 
heat scource, they usually remained 
folded like silver flowers against the 
children’s heads. Now they uncurl- 
ed, flowers blooming, showing 
black centers; now they twitched 
and turned, seeking. One turned 
and saw it. 

A point of white light high in the 
east, slowly setting. 

The children talked to each other 
in coded pulses of heat, opening 
and closing their mouths to show 
the warm interiors. 

Hev! 

What is it? 

Let's go see ! 

They hopped off across the limo- 
nite sand, forgetting the Overlord 



game, racing the meet the falling 
thing. 



I t was down when they got there 
and still shouting-hot. The probe 
was big, as big as a dwelling, a fat 
cylinder with a rounded roof above 
and a great hot mouth beneath. 
Black and white paint in a checker- 
board pattern gave it the look of a 
giant’s toy. It rested on three 
comically splayed metal legs ended 
in wide, circular feet. 

The children began rubbing 
against the metal skin, flashing 
pulses of contentment as they ab- 
sorbed the heat. 

The probe trembled. Motion in- 
side. The children jumped back, 
stood looking at each other, each 
ready to run if the others did. None 
wanted to be first. Suddenly it was 
too late. One whole curved wall of 
the probe dropped outward and 
thudded to the sand. 

A child crawled out from under- 
neath, rubbing his head and flash- 
ing heat from his mouth: words he 
shouldn’t have learned yet. The 
wound in his scalp steamed briefly 
before the edges pulled shut. 

The small, intense white sun, 
halfway down the sky, cast opaque 
black shadow across the opening in 
the probe. In the shadow something 
stirred. 

The children watched, awed. 
ABEL paused in the opening, 
then rolled out, using the slab of re- 
entry shielding as a ramp. ABEL 



59 




was a cluster of plastic and metal 
widgetry mounted on a low plat- 
form slung between six balloon 
tires. When it reached the sand it 
hesitated as if uncertain, then 
rolled out onto Mars, jerkily, feel- 
ing its way. 

The child who’d been bumped by 
the ramp hopped over to kick the 
moving thing. ABEL stopped at 
once. The child shied back. 

Suddenly an adult stood among 
them. 

WHA T ARE YOU DOING? 

Nothing , one answered. 

Just playing , said another. 
WELL BE CAREFUL WITH 
IT. The adult looked like the twin 
of any of the six children. The roof 
of his mouth was warmer than 
theirs — but the authority in his 
voice was due to more than mere 
loudness. SOMEONE MAY HAVE 
GONE TO GREAT TROUBLE 
TO BUILD THIS OBJECT. 

Yes sir. 

Somewhat subdued, the children 
gathered around the Automated 
Biological Laboratory. They watch- 
ed a door open in the side of the 
drum-shaped container that made 
up half of ABEL’s body. A gun 
inside the door fired a weighted line 
high into the air. 

That thing almost hit me. 

Serves you right. 

The line, coated with sand and 
dust, came slithering back into 
ABEL’s side. One of the children 
licked it and found it covered with 
something sticky and tasteless. 



Two children climbed onto the 
slow-moving platform, then up onto 
the cylinder. They stood up and 
waved their arms, balancing pre- 
cariously on flat triangular feet. 
ABEL swerved toward a clump of 
black grass, and both children 
toppled to the sand. One picked 
himself up and ran to climb on 
again. 

The adult watched it all 
dubiously. 

A second adult appeared beside 
him. 

YOU ARE LATE. WE HAD AN 
APPOINTMENT TO XA T BNOR - 
NEN CHIP. HAD YOU FOR- 
GOTTEN? 

I HAD. THE CHILDREN 
HA VE FOUND SOMETHING. 

SO THEY HAVE. WHAT IS IT 
DOING? 

IT WAS TAKING SOIL 
SAMPLES AND PERHAPS TRY- 
ING TO COLLECT SPORES. 
NOW IT SHO WS AN INTEREST 
IN GRASS. I WONDER HOW 
A CCURA TE ITS INSTR UMENTS 
ARE . 

IF IT WERE SENTIENT IT 
WOULD SHOW INTEREST IN 
THE CHILDREN. 

PERHAPS. 

ABEL stopped. A box at the 
front lifted on a telescoping leg and 
began a slow pan of the landscape. 
From the low dark line of the Mare 
Acidalium highlands on the north- 
eastern horizon, it swung around 
until its lens faced straight back- 
ward at the empty orange desert of 



60 



IF 




Tracus Albus. At this point the lens 
was eye to eye with the hitchhiking 
child. The child flapped his ears, 
made idiot faces, shouted nonsense 
words, and flicked at the lens with 
his long tongue. 

THAT SHOULD GIVE THEM 
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT 

WHO WOULD YOU SAY 
SENT IT? 

EARTH , I WOULD THINK. 
NOTICE THE SILICATE DISC 
IN THE CAMERA , TRANSPAR- 
ENT TO THE FREQUENCIES 
OF LIGHT MOST LIKELY TO 
PENETRATE THAT PLANETS 
THICK A TMO SPHERE. 

AGREEMENT. 

The gun fired again, into the 
black grass, and the line began to 
reel back. Another box retracted its 
curved lid. The hitchhiker peered 
into it, while the other children 
watched admiringly from below. 

One of the adults shouted, GET 
BACK , YOU YOUNG PLANT- 
BRAIN! 

The child turned to flap his 
ears at him. At that moment ABEL 
flashed a tight ruby beam of laser 
light just past his ear. For an in- 
stant it showed, an infinite length 
of neon tubing against the navy 
blue sky. 

The child scrambled down and 
han for his life. 

EARTH IS NOT IN THAT DI- 
RECTION, an adult observed. 

YET THE BEAM MUST HA VE 
BEEN A MESSAGE. SOME- 
THING IN ORBIT PERHAPS?

The adults looked skyward. Pre- 
sently their eyes adjusted. 

ON THE INNER MOON. DO 
YOU SEE IT? 

YES. QUITE LARGE . AND

NO AUTOMATED PROBE. BUT 
A VEHICLE. I THINK WE MUST

LIGHT. THE RESCOURCES? 

Having finished with the clump 
of grass, ABEL lurched into motion 
and rolled toward a dark line of 
eroded ring wall. The children 
swarmed after it. The lab fired off 
another sticky string, let it fall, and 
started to reel it back. A child 
picked it up and pulled. Lab and 
martian engaged in a tug of war 
which ended when the string broke. 
Another child poked a long, fragile 
finger into the cavity and withdrew 
it covered with something wet. Be- 
fore it could boil away, he put the 
finger in his mouth. He sent out a 
pulse of pleasure and stuck his 
tongue in the hole, into the broth 
intended for growing martian mic- 
roorganisms. 

STOP THAT! THAT IS NOT 
YOUR PROPERTY! 

The adult voice was ignored. The 



child left his tongue in the broth, 
running alongside the lab to keep 
up. Presently the others discovered 
that if they stood in front of ABEL 
it would change course to crawl 
around the “obstruction.” 

PERHAPS THE ALIENS WILL 
BE SATISFIED TO RETURN

By moving to left and right of the 
lab, by forming moving “obstruc- 
tions", the children were steering 
ABEL toward a cliff. One still rode 
high on top, pretending to steer by 
kicking the metal flanks. 

WE MUST STOP THEM. 
THEY WILL BREAK IT. 

YES ... DO YOU REALLY 
EXPECT THAT THE ALIENS 
WILL LAND A MANNED VE-

M ore unthinkable thoughts. 

I may be making a Serious 
Mistake with these unthinkable 
thoughts sections. People will come 
to expect them every column, and I 
doubt if I have enough for constant 
bi-monthly display/flaunting. 

Nevertheless, with a little help 
from my friends I may stagger 
through. For instance, Barry Malz- 
berg (rising young nihilist writer 
about town) sent me an article 
which appeared recently in the New 
York magazine . * . (or was it the 
New Yorker? I am nothing if not 



uncertain) . which was "by Ron 
Sproat and which detailed his stint 
in a porno factory (“The Working 
Day in a Porno Factory”: . I 

was expected to write 40 pages of 
erotic material a day — a 200-page 
novel a week for $120. Still, it was a 
job . .”) 

Since Jim Baen wants this 
column to be “a miniature Alien 
Critic ” I have no qualms about 
quoting from Barry’s letter (for 
which I have his grudging permis- 
sion).

aleck remarks . Baen 

****************************** 

So. Barry sent the article on the 
porno sweatshop and I responded 
with words to the effect that it was 
places like that that gave porno a 
bad name — that sheer junk writing 
as described by Sproat had driven 
the audience (and publishers!) for 
well-written porno away and killed 
a rising young genre . more or 
less. And that I didn’t see how any- 
body could even type 40 pages a day 
(10,000 words, for God’s sake) to 
say nothing of making the words 
coherent. As for plot, characteriza- 
tion, atmosphere, etc., forget it. 

(When I was writing porno for a 
living the best I ever did was 20 
pages a day, in a short two-week 
sprint, and I was young then, in 
1960, and full of piss and vinegar. 
Nowadays I got no vinegar left.) 

Barry, in turn, responded as 
follows: 

“That’s the agents’ and writers’ 
argument; Gresham’s Law that is 
holding that this stuff will drive out 
the good work and the audience it- 
self. I am not sure of this. My ob- 
servations throughout the years 
have been — and the people at 
Typographies were gambling on 
this- — that quality level meant noth- 
ing, that you were dealing with an 
audience of people who were drawn 
to the material for sub- or trans-

literary reasons and that as long as 
the words were there and the coup- 
lings they wouldn’t even detect the 
difference between that and any 
other level of work right up to the 
highest professionalism. In short, 
any money paid in raising the 
quality level of the material would 
be wasted. 

“Maurice Girodias’s experience 
at the Olympia Press would cer- 
tainly bear this out. 

“If you think about it a while, 
the same argument kind of applies 
to s-f where the worst material 
(Perry Rhodan) appears to consis- 
tently outsell the best ( Camp Con- 
centration) with so few exceptions 
as to not really affect the gray over- 
all pattern. Think of Charles Platt’s 
letter (in The Alien Critic #8) which 
is quite a good statement of the 
problem. 

“I can see the trend of the 
market cutting into two types of 



64 



IF 



work within fifteen years; cheap 
work like this hammered out by 
hacks at the lowest possible return 
and bestsellers which have been 
manipulated by publishers. There 
may be no middleground. Would 
you question that the market today 
looks harder to break than at any 
time in the last twenty years?” 

Now that to me is absolutely un- 
thinkable! Are most science fiction 
readers drawn to it for sub- or 
trans-literary reasons? Could it be 
true that as long as the material 
deals with aliens and spaceships 
and other planets and mutant hu- 
mans and strange futures and time 
travel, etc., that it doesn’t matter a 
damn if it’s well-written or not? 

1 thought about it. My eyes 
glazed a bit as I remembered the 
well-known rules for gothic ro- 
mance pocketbook covers: in 
gothics the cover must show a hero- 
ine in flight and/or fear, an old 
house or castle must appear in the 
background on a dark and/or 
stormy night, and there must be 
one lighted window showing ... or 
the book won’t sell worth a damn, 
no matter how well written. 

(I guess the heroine has to be 
white, too. I’ve never seen a black 
heroine on a gothic pb cover.) 

And I remembered Terry Carr’s 
Ace Special line — quality science 
fiction with quality covers. The 
problem was the books didn’t sell 
very well. Were the covers too “ad- 
vanced” and “different”? Weren’t 
the sf identification signals strong 
enough? Was the fiction too good? 

And I know that the Ace Perry 
Rhodan reprints packaged in a 
pocketbook magazine format — 
aimed at a 10-year-old mentality — 



are apparently a thriving success. 

And I know that Don Wollheim’s 
DAW pocketbook line of science 
fiction sells well. He uses traditional 
sf covers, dynamic and colorful, 
and his editorial policy is to publish 
a lot of sf adventure, a lot of tra- 
ditional plots and themes. 

I talked with Don Wollheim for 
about twenty minutes at a regional 
sf convention in Santa Monica, 
California, some years ago and he 
struck me as a keen-minded, prag- 
matic editor. He loves science fic- 
tion, and he is idealistic concerning 
how sf should portray mankind. 
His book. The Universe Makers , 
published by Harper & Row, details 
this essentially optimistic view of 
man’s future.

Don recognizes that most sf 
readers (as with most audiences for 
any type of entertainment) like the 
tried and true, the familiar, the re- 
assuring . even the broadmind- 
ed, free-thinking science fiction 
audience. 

Don does publish some “differ- 
ent” sf, but not too much. He 
knows better than to anger and 
“cheat” his clientele; they have 
come to know what he publishes, 
they like it and they will feel be- 
trayed and angry if he deviates too 
often, too radically, from the usual 
fare. 

But to return and look straight 
into the awful face of the sf-sells- 
because-of-its-symbols and because 
it satisfies emotional needs in a 
certain number of people and qual- 
ity doesn’t count argument (which 
is actually a determinist/Freudian

argument and denies our sacred 
and inviolable Free Will, and is an 
assertion that we are ruled perhaps 
90% of the time by our masked in- 
stincts and our sub-conscious . .) 
1 tend to agree with it with reserva- 
tions. 

The they'll buy anything if their 
buttons are pushed theory applies 
to any product to a degree. The de- 
gree it works probably depends on 
the product and the accessibility of 
buttons and triggers, and knowl- 
edge of how to push and pull them. 

It’s a fascinating, sometimes de- 
moralizing subject, and everyone 
with an ounce of inflated ego 
should read the literature. 

I think that in science fiction, the 
audience does reward quality writ- 
ing with increased sales and popu- 
larity. But there are different kinds 
of quality in fiction, and the kind of 
superior writing Barry refers to 
(and the kind most intellectuals 
and “serious” writers and univer- 
sity professors consider the best of 
all sf writing) is not the kind that is 
very often rewarded with big (or 
even moderate) money. 

I think there are three spheres of 
fiction writing: the “artistic”, the 
“commercial” and the “juvenile”. 
They are separate, with separate (if 
slightly overlapping) audiences, and 
I do not believe it is fair or ap- 
propriate to say one is superior or 
better than any of the others. 

Generally speaking, the “artis- 
tic” fiction is concerned with style, 
experiment, subtle characteriza- 
tions, message, understatement; 
“commercial” fiction is reader- 
oriented in that it seeks to satisfy 
natural story-lust and uses enter- 



tainment values inherent in plot 
formulas; while “juvenile” fiction is 
pure story simplified to basic ac- 
tion/idea essentials. 

Each type of fiction can be 
written superbly. Each type re- 
quires great skills and talents if it is 
to be done well. 

There are only a few writers 
around who can write well enough 
to appeal to all three audiences at 
once, with a single work. 

To get back to at least partially 
dismantaling the they’ll-buy-any- 
thing theory as it applies to science 
fiction: let me quote a paragraph or 
two or three from a self-published 
sf story sent to me recently for re- 
view. 

(37 printed pages, double-spac- 
ed, typewritten, photo-offset 8 V 2 x 
11 format.) 

It is titled Ordiea — Planet of 
Fear, and it was written by Janice 
M. Croy who says in an accom- 
panying letter, “I wrote Ordiea for 
people who like to read something 
that is not full of dirt like so many 
other types of books today. It is 
basically sci-fi but also contains At- 
lantis, ESP, reincarnation & some 
present happenings.” 

1 was prejudiced against her im- 
mediately; anyone who uses the 
abominable show biz construct 
“sci-fi” is not a Trufan or Tru- 
reader and cannot be considered 
one of Us. 

(Yes, I know “sci-fi” was origi- 
nated by Forry Ackerman — one of 
the great First Fans — but the media 
took it and used it and now it is a 
name for science fiction on a par 
with “colored” for blacks.)

pridefully objective, and I opened 
Janice Croy’s impeccably printed 
“book” with BE FAIR lit up in my 
mind. 

After a moment another sign 
switched on: BE VICIOUS! I must 
show you why. It begins: 

INNER GALAXY NEWS: 
March 21, 3007 

Today is the day long to be re- 
membered in the history of the 
UNITED FEDERATION OF GALAXIES. 
Four young Earthmen are going to 
leave our galaxy and venture into 
the second galaxy east of ours in 
search of other humanoid life. For 
over three years now, the top scien- 
tists of Earth, Mars, Zandar and 
our observatory on Pluto have been 
picking up codetype signals from 
the fifth planet in that small 
galaxy’s solar system. 

“I’m sure glad they wished us 
luck, we sure need it even though 
we have the newest rocket ship 
built. Just think, it has a meteor re- 
pellor shield, suspended animation 
chambers, and runs on thermonu- 
clear energy,’’ said Phil. 

**** 

The four men were soon in a 
deep sleep traveling into the first 
galaxy. One year passes quickly, 
then just as they are nearing the 
second galaxy, the unexpected hap- 
pened. The rocket ship is knocked 
off course by a huge asteroid. The 
automatic alarm awakens the men 
from their deep sleep. 

“Oh, no! We’ve only been asleep 
for a year. Something has gone 
wrong,” exclaims Phil. “Something 
happened all right. We’ve been 



knocked off course to the south 
towards the Andromeda galaxy. If 
we’re lucky we’ll land on the 20th 
planet in its first solar system,” re- 
plied John. 

The men contacted NASA of 
their new course. They were in- 
structed to go ahead with the 
original plans. 

Oog. That mish-mash of ignor- 
ance and incredibly bad writing is 
enough to make any true sf enthu- 
siast weep ... or laugh. And I 
doubt that any habitual science fic- 
tion reader would buy the “book” 
out of pure symbol-reflex because it 
has other galaxies, planets, space- 
men, rocket ships, etc. in it. (She 
wants $1 .50 for a copy, by the way, 
and the address is Janice Croy, 512 
S. Logan, Denver, CO 80209 . 
just in case some of you DO want to 
read it.) 

Barry’s thoughts on the future of 
the sf publishing scene are another 
kettle of tentacles, and I have to 
suspect he may be right . with 
these observations of mine added: I 
think I see the growing number of 
sf and fantasy enthusiasts (fandom 
in the larger sense) divided into 
small, yet economically viable sub- 
genre specialty audiences which 
will be serviced by small publishing 
houses. 

Small publishers have always 
sprung up in fandom to print books 
about and by favorite out-of-print 
writers — Robert E. Howard, H. P. 
Lovecraft, E. R. Burroughs, etc., 
and to perpetuate limited -appeal 
styles of writing, as well as collec- 
tions of critical works (Knight, 
Blish), and analyses of sf and of 



THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT

specific writers (Panshin on Hein- 
lein), and the bibliographic works 
are numerous and exhaustive. 

But these small publishers were 
always marginal, usually unprofit- 
able labors of love. Perhaps now, 
and in the future, I think these 
specialty publishers will find 
enough buyers to permit survival 
and even a bit of growth. 

What man has done, man is doing, 
and man will do. 

I DLE SPECULATION DEPT. On the 
one hand I dote on Grand Con- 
spiracy theories of history and eco- 
nomics . and current events. 
And on the other hand I believe in 
the Accident theory of history and 
civilization. 

(Nobody could conceivably have 
planned for the recent mess of ‘fuel 
crisis’, inflation, and Watergate. 
But the megabanks and the largest 
international corporations must be 
at least trying to control the future!) 

There is in me, also, a strong 
desire to be as independent as 
possible, to be no man’s servant, to 
owe no one. I hate and fear debt. 

That’s why I’ve always toyed with 
ideas of being a total hermit, of be- 
ing an absolutely invisible hippie. 
(An invisible hippie is a person who 
lives off the surplus, the throw- 
aways of our society, and who wears 
the uniform of the square. The 
role-playing long-haired hippies get 
hassled; short-haired hippies wear- 
ing ties do not.) 

I’ve accomplished this invisibility 
to a degree, but total independence 
has eluded me. (Even an invisible 
hippie is dependent on throw- 
aways.) For instance, I want to be 
able to run this house on electricity 



converted from the sun’s heat, or 
from wind power. 

Unfortunately, it costs too much 
to be power-independent of society. 
The state of the sun-wind power 
conversion art is too primitive. 

So, I’m waiting. The technologi- 
cal revolution is almost to the point 
where some smart-ass corporation 
will develop a something , a new, 
super-efficient battery or power- 
storage device which will give them 
a bigger profit margin on their new, 
heavy-duty factory franizams — and 
they won’t realize until too late that 
it can make a house self-contained, 
independent of society in a very im- 
portant aspect. 

When that “equalizer” comes 
down the pike it’ll spread like 
wildfire, and a real social revolu- 
tion will follow. 

That’s the Accident theory of his- 
tory. 

Big Money hates such accidents. 
A billion dollars is very fearful, and 
it loves security and an assured 
future; it tries to make plans for 
itself, and that involves control — of 
governments, of culture, media, 
people . 

But accidents happen! 

Up till now industrialization and 
technology have worked to centra- 
lize power over things and people; 
inevitably humanity has become 
more and more interdependent. 

But I have a hunch/wish that the 
process will turn around abruptly, 
by accident , and vast numbers of 
people will show a great thirst for 
that new-found bit of freedom and 
independence. They’ll turn govern- 
ments upside-down to get laws con- 
sistent with their new-found self- 
contained home cultures and so- 



68 



IF 




cieties. 

(And probably equally vast num- 
bers of people will fear this change 
and resist the movement.) 

The newly developing laser tech- 
nology leads me to speculate that 
soon a powerful, deadly laser rifle/ 
cannon will be put together that 
can be either mass produced or 
manufactured in the home work- 
shop for peanuts. If this happens a 
home instantly becomes a too-dan- 
gerous-to-mess-with island of inde- 
pendence.

S ome sort of monument should 
be put up to mark this year — 
the year Yandro reached its 20th 
anniversary. 

I know there are at least 40,000 
of you out there now who are 
frowning and shrugging. What the 



hell is Yandro? 

Yandro is a fanzine. It is prob- 
ably the second longest lived sf 
fanzine in the world. (Harry War- 
ner’s Horizons is likely the oldest 
regularly, continuously published 
zineat 138 quarterly issues . but 
Horizons , come to think, is much 
more a personal journal than a sf 
fanzine ... so maybe Yandro is 
the oldest continuing fanzine.) 

Yandro has seen the ink of a 
mimeograph 225 times, and in ear- 
lier years was a monthly, I believe, 
if memory serves. Now Yandro is 
irregular, but still appears six to 
eight times a year. 

Who would be foolish and stub- 
born enough to publish a 30-plus 
page fanzine 225 times over twenty 
years? Robert and Juanita Coulson, 
that’s who. 

They also write science fiction 
and gothic novels, but that is sec- 
ondary, of course. 

Robert “Buck” Coulson is a 
gruff, opinionated, admirable man 
who has a massive accumulation of 
books (mostly st), who reads omni- 
vorously and who writes dozens of 
reviews in his characteristic to-the- 
point style that spares no writer’s 
ego. 

For instance, this review of The 
Pritcher Mass by Gordon R. Dick- 
son is fairly typical: 

‘Actually this is the old van 
Vogt plot of the superman who 
doesn’t know his own strength 
until his enemies force him to use 
it. Gordy ties up the loose ends 
better than van Vogt did, but he 
never really suspended my disbe- 
lief. Further, I’m getting tired of 
sf writers ending all our pollution 
problems by magic in the last 



THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 




chapter. This is a pretty good ad- 
venture story, but Gordy has 
done a lot better/ 

Buck also writes a column of fan- 
zine reviews with ratings, about 
four times a year. His estimates of 
worth are fairly accurate (meaning 
I agree with him most of the time), 
and the addresses and prices he 
lists are invaluable for anyone wish- 
ing to explore the complex world of 
sf fan publishing. 

Buck also writes an editorial 
column, “Rumblings”, which deals 
with the life-style and vicissitudes 
of living of the Coulsons, and in- 
cludes comments on any number of 
current local and national concerns. 

Juanita has her opening personal 
column, “Ramblings”, she com- 
ments on readers’ letters printed in 
“Grumblings” — the letter column, 
and is the keeper of the mimeo 
(which means she runs off the 
issues). 

It is worth noting that their 
young son, Bruce, is a chess enthu- 
siast and writes a short personal 
column in Yandro . too. He is being 
groomed (I suspect — a Grand 
Strategy) to continue the zine when 
he is married and Buck and Juanita 
are too Old and Tired to continue. 

Thus Yandro \ a force unto itself, 
will continue down through the 
generations of fandom. 

Used to be the Coulsons didn’t 
want Yandro reviewed, to keep the 
circulation within bounds, but late- 
ly I haven’t read of that restric- 
tion. If you’d like to try them for a 
copy, send 50 e (and a stamped, 
self-addressed envelope in case they 
are not inclined to sell or are out of 
copies or whatever) to Robert & 
Juanita Coulson, Route 3, Hartford 



City, IN 47348, USA.) 

Ummm, maybe it would be best 
if you didn’t tell them Geis sent 
you .

have been left to die. 

Of the five the ship abandoned 
only I still live. The others died one 
by ohe as we sat amidst the boxes 
and crates. No fanfare, no cries, no 
suffering. One moment they were 
staring into nothingness, the next 
they were dead. 

I am alone, left to die, and know 
not why. What act condemned me? 
Did those who sentenced me and 
my companions to this place have 
just cause? No matter; I feel no 
fear, no anxiety, just acceptance of 
what seems so natural. 

When we had first disembark- 
ed — when was that? — we’d begun 
to open the crates left with us; their 
contents, food containers, medicine 
kits, instruments and articles of 



clothing now lay scattered about. 
Long before we finished we realized 
as had those before us, that we 
should sit quietly and wait for ob- 
livion. It was but a short time away. 

I wait. A dim prodding within 
my brain disturbs my tranquil- 
ity, demanding I recall something, 
offering no clue as to what. My 
crime? (Had I committed one?) 
What other reason for abandon- 
ment? My past? I try to ignore this 
disturbing mental activity. All will 
be over soon. Eternity waits. My 
agitation grows, forcing me to re- 
member. This planet, this bleak 
place of brush, sand and odd- 
shaped gray boulders has a name — 
but I can’t recall ever knowing it.

Memories are stirring — but memo- 
ries of some time ago . 

The planet Montos, world dedi- 
cated to joy and excitement. Risa, 
woman of rapture, enslaver whose 
exotic perfumes mingled with the 
desire-driven rise of body heat, re- 
leasing aromas that banished inhi- 
bitions and stirred passion to an 
unbearable intensity. The craving 
to possess her smooth, sweetly 
scented body could only be curbed 
by utter exhaustion. * 

Montos — and Risa. 

The frontier wars. Federation 
fleets clashing with Proxan hordes. 
Man and allied races fighting a 
breed of reptilian monsters, every 
battle a desperate one; defeat would 
mean obliteration. The terror of 
being ensnared by the Proxan 
pressor-beam, the exhilaration of 
pinpointing the aliens with our own 
weapons. 

I remember battle — command — 
the deaths of comrades. 

Exploration and discovery — that 
too I remember now. Calgara, the 
world my ship discovered, a world 
dominated by a life form instinc- 
tively hostile to all exo-sentients. 

It was I who led the guard-force 
of the Exploratory Commission. I 
watched my men fighting and dying 
as we crawled through the dense 
steaming forests and voracious 
bogs, the inhabitants fighting us 
for every inch of ground. My men 
eventually forced the enemy to 
come to terms, thus securing yet 
another world for the Federation. 



I remember victory — and I re- 
member defeat. 

My mind is alive with other 
battles, with the love of strange and 
fascinating females, with drinking 
and laughing and sorrowing with 
my shipmates . 

What is the meaning of the four 
stinking, rotting corpses that lie 
littered about me? Who are they? 
Why are we here? It seems useless 
to think about the present, but still 
the prodding in my brain forces me 
to continue to recall — to continue 
climbing the ladder of memory 
until Tve reached the final rung. 

The Ulitarian incident — now I 
remember, fd sent my ship across 
the neutral zone to overtake a 
Proxan raider that had massacred 
an agricultural colony on Ulitaria. 
We caught the raider, destroying it 
in scanner-range of the alien base. 

I was immediately summoned to 
Federational Fleet Headquarters 
and arrived there ready to accept 
the consequences. But no charges 
were preferred. Instead I was order- 
ed to undertake a special mission 
and gratefully made haste to do so. 

What had followed? It no longer 
interests me. I don’t care to pur- 
sue — again the twist of a nerve in 
my brain; again I am compelled to 
remember. 

There had been an argument at 
fleet headquarters, a discussion I 
wasn’t meant to hear, yet hear it I 
did. 

“Is that dismal bit of space dirt 
worth more lives?” asked a mild

but determined voice. 

“How the hell do I know? Not 
one team left any kind of record. 
Damn it — it’s our service’s respon- 
sibility to find out what’s going on 
there,’’ a harsh tone responded. 
“Animals, wired ...” 

“No good. There’s a strong mag- 
netic force around Zingor that im- 
pedes monitoring instrumentation. 
We need men on the spot. We’vfc 
got to solve this riddle. Zingor’s at- 
mosphere is almost identical to 
Earth’s . one percent differ- 
ence . one percent of a substance 
we can’t identify. And who’s to say 
we might not encounter it on some 
other world? Or what if the Proxans 
discover it?’’ 

“Our people die mysteriously. So 
we send more. And they die. How 
long do we — ?’’ 

“Until we get some answers. The 
next team has already been select- 
ed. Commander Aurlo is the most 
fiercely competitive bastard in the 
service ... an independent ... a 
maverick who bends all the rules — 
but gets results. Maybe he can 
bend Zingor’s rules ... or its 
natural laws ... or whatever it is 
that kills our men.’’ 

“And the precautions?’’ 

“Aurlo’s ship will remain in orbit 
and touch down every sixty days.’’ 
The mild voice turned explosive. 
“Sixty days! Autopsies indicate no 
one survived for more than three 
weeks.” 

“Can’t be helped. It takes that 
long for ship’s computer to de- 



ionize after being immersed in Zin- 
gor’s magnetic field ...” 

The conversation begins to fade, 
but the nagging infinitesimal spark 
blinking in my head forces me to 
worry at my memory like a dog with 
a bone. 

put it all together. 

1 am Aurlo — I am on the planet 
Zingor. My ship is orbiting above 
me and these dead bodies are from 
my own crew. 

I have not been left to die but to 
live! To live! 

But even as my spirit surges I feel 
the darkness seeping back. I must 
fight it, and — I suddenly realize — 
my memories are my only weapon. 
Risa, war, fear, glory! I can live 
only as long as I can retain my 
ability to recall. Strong emotions, 
so often man’s bitterest enemy, are 
the means of defeating the malig- 
nancy of Zingor. 

1 will not die. I’ll bury my dead, 
feed myself, record my findings and 
await the arrival of my ship. Some- 
where in the crates are breather 
units and those I must have. I will 
squeeze my brain’s storehouse of 
years gone by. 

I feel hunger and fatigue, and 
they reassure me — I am once again 
subject to normal stimuli. But first 
I must find a breather unit. I start 
to rise, sensing peace and exhaus- 
tion but the feeling passes — I have 
been left to die — and don’t know 
why. 

It is not important. •

signer with pacifist inclinations , 
has accompanied tycoon and big- 
game hunter , OSCAR SCHOEN- 
BERG, on a clandestine expedition 
to Hunters ' Planet There , once 
every fifteen standard years, the 
best hunting in the known galaxy 
can be found . though outworlders' 
trips such as SCHOENBERG’S are 
frowned on by the Interstellar 
Authority. 

Also , five hundred years before ,

Hunters' is a part , grart com* 

maiufer JOHANN KARLSEN led a 
human- manned fleet to victory over 
the berserkers. Berserkers are auto- 
mated warships and auxiliary ma- 
chines built during some inter- 
stellar war between long-vanished 
races , ancLat the time of the story 
will ravaging the galaxy , their pro- 
grammed purpose being the de- 
struction of all life . 

One berserker survived the war 
on Hunters' Planet, and was hidden 
bv a cult of humans who wor- 
shipped it as Death personified. 
This intelligent machine has work- 
ed with generations of human aides 
until its secret cult has become the 
most powerful group on the planet, 
challenged only by the shadowy or- 
ganization called the Brotherhood. 
The berserker's goal is to obtain a 
starship and carry out its pro- 
grammed tasks of depopulating the 
planet and — killing the berserkers' 
great enemy KARLSEN. 



The plan to seize a starship in- 
volves luring some outworld craft to 
land at Godsmountain, where the 
cultists now openly manage the 
planet-wide worship of Thorun, 
god of war and of the hunt, and the 
chief object of worship on this 
planet of hunters and warriors. In 
the Hunterian pantheon, KARL- 
SEN has also become a demigod. 
Outworlders are to be lured by the 
prospect of watching a Tournament 
of warriors fighting to the death in 
single combat. The winner and sole 
survivor of the Tournament is 
promised a place of eternal honor 
at Thorun' s right hand, while even 
the losers are assured of god hood. 

SCHOENBERG, fascinated by 
the intensity of life attainable dur- 
ing moments of extreme danger, 
and by heroic deeds ( he and 
SUOMI have both made recordings 
of KARLSEN’S battle messages, 
which are still radiating through 
interstellar space) wants to watch 
the Tournament, and lands his ship 
on a small mesa on Godsmoun- 
tain' s flank. Aboard as his guests, 
besides SUOMI, are GUS DE LA 
TORRE, who turns out to be a 
sadist: ATHENA POULSON, who 
is SCHOENBERG’S private secre- 
tary and the chief reason for 
SUOMI’S coming on the trip ; and 
CELESTE SERVETUS and BAR- 
BARA HURTADO, playgirls who 
were brought along for male con- 
sumption like the cigars and the 
wine.

T he climber rolled the great 
length of his frame out onto the 
horizontal surface of the mesa and 
raised his gigantic head to look 
straight at Suomi. The impassive 
face, its lower half masked by wild 
dark beard and mustache, was of 
the right size to fit the head, and 
yet it was subtly wrong. Not that it 
was scarred, or intrinsically de- 
formed. Though it was no mask in 
the ordinary sense, it was yet artifi- 
cial. Too skillfully artificial, like 
the work of sopie mad artist, con- 
vinced he could fool people into 
thinking that this robot, this 
dummy, was a man. 

The figure rose gracefully to its 
feet and Suomi saw something that 
its body had obscured.* At the very 
edge of the cliff a climbef s piton 
had been hammered into'the rock. 
The end of a line was knotted to an 
eye in the piton and the line went 
tautly back out of sight over the 
cliff. Now the face of a second 
climber, this one of normal stature, 
indubitably human, rose into view. 

Meanwhile the trailblazing giant 
had risen to his full height. He was 
taller than anyone Suomi had ever 
seen. As he stood up he thrust a 



mountaineer's hammer into a 
pouch at his waist and with the 
same motion of his arm unsheathed 
an enormous sword. 

Suomi had come to a dead stop, 
not paralyzed with fear as he had 
been by the glacier-beast, but 
simply unable to form any satisfac- 
tory explanation for what his senses 
were recording. 

The first answer to cross his 
mind was that this was all some 
ugly and elaborate practical joke 
arranged by Schoenberg or De La 
Torre but he realized even before 
the idea was fully formed that they 
would hardly think it necessary to 
go to so much trouble to scare him. 
And Schoenberg, at least, would 
have too much sense to yell boo at a 
nervous man with a loaded weapon. 

The second explanation to pop 
into Suomi’s head was that there 
must be hooligans on Hunters’ 
planet the same as everywhere else, 
and some of these had come to see 
what they might steal from the out- 
worlders’ ship. 

But the marauders’ giant leader 
was not covered by either of these 
hypotheses. The mind stopped and 
boggled at the sight, then tried to 
go around it and proceed. 

With some vague idea of scaring 
off bandits, Suomi began to unsling 
the rifle from his back. As he did so 
the incredible giant took two steps 
toward him with its sword upraised, 
then halted as if satisfied with its 
position. 

By this time the second climber, 
a Hunterian warrior, young and 
tough-looking, was completely up 
on the cliff-top and proceeding with 
drawn sword toward the open 
hatchway of the ship. The third. 



BERSERKER’S PLANET

also of normal size, was right be- 
hind him. 

“Halt,” said Suomi, conscious 
even as he spoke of the uncertainty 
in his own voice. He felt foolish 
when no one halted even though the 
rifle was now in his hands. 

Now there were two human 
invaders on top of the mesa besides 
the man-shaped giant, and another 
armed man was climbing into 
sight. The ship’s hatch stood open 
and — except for Suomi — unpro- 
tected. And Barbara was in there. 

He had not leveled the rifle at 
them yet, but now he did, and 
shouted “Halt!”, this time with 
conviction. Instantly the huge 
figure lunged toward him, faster 
than any human could conceivably 
move. The man-slicing sword was 
held high, ready to strike. Suomi 
squeezed the trigger, realized when 
it failed to move that he had failed 
to release the safety. Instinctively 
he stepped back from the onrush- 
ing sword and felt his foot move 
into empty air. His left hand, 
grabbing wildly for support, caught 
hold of the climbing rope and saved 
him from a killing fall. The misstep 
dropped him only a short distance 
down from the edge of the mesa, 
but still his heel came down on rock 
with an impact that jarred his leg 
and spine. His arm twisted with the 
fall and the rope slipped from his 
grip. He lost all footing, tumbled 
and rolled on gravel, and stopped 
when he came up with a breath- 
taking slam against an outcropping 
of rock. Still he was only about 
halfway down the path, the steepest 
part of which was just below him. 

With his back against the rock 
that had stopped him, he half sat, 



half lay there, facing up the hill. 
Dazedly he realized that he was not 
seriously injured, and that his right 
hand still held the rifle. Now his 
finger found the small safety lever 
beside the breech and turned it 
back. Somehow he even remember- 
ed to set it for full automatic fire. 

The giant man-thing with its 
sword upraised reared into view 
above. When it saw Suomi it drop- 
ped itself onto the steep slope with 
the grace of a dancer. With sword 
leveled at him now it descended 
upon him, moving under perfect 
control, one long bounding stride, 
two . 



T he rifle stuttered in Suomi’s 
hands. The sword-brandishing 
golem’s left arm erupted in a spray 
of dry-looking particles and smoke 
as the man-thing spun in an incred- 
ible pirouette, more graceful by far 
than any wounded animal. Knock : 
ed off balance and deflected from 
its course by the shock of the rifle’s 
force-packets, the towering shape 
slid past Suomi and on down the 
slope. 

But it did not fall. In another 
moment, near the bottom, it had 
regained full control and stopped 
its slide. Then it turned and was 
calmly climbing, like a mountain 
goat, at a fast run. The sword, 
whirling and gleaming, came to- 
ward him once again, the face 
below it a mask of insane serenity. 

Suomi uttered a sobbing noise, a 
compound of terror and frustra- 
tion. In his hands the rifle leaped 
and kicked, firing continuously 
while he struggled to keep it aimed. 
The fur-clad monster, face still 



78 



IF 




without expression beneath the 
silver headband, was stopped in its 
tracks. Puffs of fur flew from it 
under the barrage, and splinters 
and streaks of unidentifiable de- 
bris. Then it was hurled back down 
the hill, still staggering to keep its 
feet, black cloak alternately furling 
and flying. Far at the bottom 
Suomi’s continuing mad fusillade 
pinned it like an insect, leaping and 
convulsing wildly, against an im- 
movable tree trunk. 

A force-packet dissolved the sil- 
ver headband and half the mon- 
ster’s face in a gray bloodless 
smear. The sword flew from its 
hand. With a final, awkward, up- 
hill lunge, the figure fell. It rolled 
over on the ground and lay inert. At 
last Suomi released the trigger. 

Suddenly all was quiet. The sky, 
the mesa, seemed to be whirling 
around Suomi’s head. He realized 
that he was sprawled precariously 
on the steep slope, his head con- 
siderably lower than his feet. One 
false move and he would go plung- 
ing down. He was breathing in little 
sobbing gasps. Moving very care- 
fully, still clutching the precious 
rifle, he got his feet more or less be- 
neath him. Now he could feel a 
dozen cuts and bruises from the 
fall. 

He should get back up and de- 
fend the ship. But the slope just 
above him was impossible. How 
had he survived the tumble down? 
He must be tougher than he had 
realized. His rolling descent had 
taken him away from the regular 
climbing path. Couldn’t get back to 
it here by going sideways. He would 
have to go all the way down and 
start up again on the proper route. 



To get down he had to re-sling 
the rifle and use both hands to grip 
the rock. In his present state he 
took without thinking about them 
slides and drops that would cer- 
tainly have broken his ankles if he 
had essayed them calmly. 

At the bottom he kept his eyes on, 
the figure of his fallen enemy. He 
unslung the rifle once again, but it 
was not needed. His rifle fire had 
beaten the facing surface of the 
great tree trunk into splinters, 
which had showered down with 
leaves and twigs to make a patchy 
carpet on the ground. On top of 
this carpet a giant doll lay huddled 
where his violence had flung it. 



S uomi, the killer, still unable to 
understand, now unable to take 
his eyes away, came closer. This 
time, too, as with the glacier-beast, 
there was scattered fur, though this 
fur was a long-dead dull brown in- 
stead of gallant orange. 

He prodded with the rifle’s 
muzzle, put out a hand, moved the 
tattered cloak. What was left of the 
thing’s face was turned away. Be- 
neath the torn fur garments the 
bulky torso itself was torn and shat- 
tered, pilling madness into the light 
of day. No blood and bones this 
time, but wads of stuff that might 
have filled a doll. Amid this stuff- 
ing were disjointed metal rods and 
cams and wheels, here and there a 
gleaming box or tube, and running 
through all were complex networks 
of metal cables and insulated wires 
with an irregular, handmade look 
about them. And this, some power 
source. A hydrogen lamp? No, a 
nuclear fuel cell, not made to ener- 



BERSERKER’S PLANET

gize a robot, but doubtless serving 
well enough. 

He had killed, yet he had not. 
This corpse had never lived, that 
much was certain. Now he could 
look more coolly. He touched the 
side of the cheek above the beard, 
and it felt like smooth leather. The 
fur clothing over the torso had 
never covered skin, only a carapace 
of hand-worked metal armor. In its 
slight irregularities of shape and 
thickness the armor reminded 
Suomi of a warrior’s shield he had 
just seen at the Tournament below. 
At close range the energy rifle had 
opened this crude armor like an 
egg. Inside were the structural 
parts, cables and rods and such, al- 
so handworked, and mysteriously 
jumbled with these were a few seal- 
ed boxes, smooth and perfect in 
shape and finish, obviously of quite 
different origin than the rest . 

He grasped at his belt. The com- 
municator was gone, and he real- 
ized with dismay that it must have 
been knocked or scraped from its 
holder at some point during his 
fall. 

“Carlos!” It was Barbara’s voice, 
shrill with panic, coming from 
somewhere out of sight above him. 
“Carlos, help — ” It cut off abruptly 
there. 

Suomi ran to the foot of the 
climbing path and looked up. In 
view at the top was the head of one 
of the Hunterian men who had 
scaled the cliff. Suomi took an as- 
cending step; at once the man’s 
hands came into view, holding a 
short, thick bow with arrow nocked 
and ready. Suomi began to lift the 
rifle, and an arrow buzzed past his 
ear. It brought a pang of authentic 



fright, but Suomi did not shoot 
back. Dropping one man dead up 
there was not going to help: Su- 
perior firepower or not, Suomi was 
not going to be able to do anything 
for Barbara, or regain the ship, 
without help. It would be impos- 
sible to climb the path with the rifle 
in his hands and once he slung his 
weapon he would be at a hopeless 
disadvantage. 

He must get help. Suomi turned 
and ran, ignoring signals of damage 
from his bruised and bleeding legs 
and aching back. He headed for the 
site of the Tournament to spread 
the alarm. The rifle was not noisy 
and probably no one there had 
heard the firing. 

Before he had gotten fifty meters 
into the trees, a line of uniformed 
men holding bows and spears at the 
ready appeared before him, de- 
ployed at right angles to his path, 
cutting him off. A white-robed 
priest stood with them. The uni- 
formed soldiers of Godsmountain, 
and they were not coming to help 
the outworlder against bandits but 
were leveling their weapons in his 
direction. “Try to take him alive,” 
the priest said clearly. 

Suomi abruptly altered course 
once more, running downhill for 
greater speed, angling away from 
both soldiers and ship. Behind him 
there were signal-like whistles and 
birdcall cries. 

A single set of footsteps came 
pounding after him, gaining 
ground. Suomi visualized another 
robot monster. He stopped and 
turned, saw that it was only a hu- 
man soldier, but still fired with 
deadly intent. He missed, blowing a 
notch out of a tree limb above his 



80 



IF 




pursuer’s head. Whether wounded 
by splinters, stunned by concus- 
sion, or merely frightened, the man 
dove for cover and gave up the 
chase. Suomi fled. In the distance 
other men still whistled and. signal- 
led to one another, but the sounds 
grew fainter as he ran. When at 
last, utterly winded, he threw him- 
self down in a dense tangled 
thicket, no sound came to him but 
his own laboring lungs and pound- 
ing blood. 



VII 

W hen Suomi walked away from 
the Tournament, Schoenberg 
noted that Athena was looking 
after him, an annoyed expression 
on her face. The two of them seem- 
ed to annoy each other, and that 
was about all. It was beginning to 
look as if nothing interesting was 
going to happen between them one 
way or another — which was just as 
well from Schoenberg’s point of 
view because the girl was an invalu- 
able worker and intensely loyal. 
Schoenberg would hate to lose her. 

He wondered how she had be- 
come interested in a man like 
Suomi. He seemed like such a 
marshmallow, trailing her pas- 
sively, failing at the hunt, trying to 
stay away from the Tournament on 
principle and failing that, then 
puking at the sight of blood when 
he did come. Of course such a mis- 
erable performance record might in 
some way prove attractive to a 
woman. Schoenberg had long ago 
given up trying to predict what 
women might do. That was one rea- 
son he liked having them around at 



all times; they were sure to generate 
surprises. 

On his other side. Celeste moved 
a little closer and brushed very 
lightly against his arm. That one 
was becoming tiresome. No more 
pretense of independence. Now she 
just couldn’t bear to be separated 
from him, it seemed. 

All at once he forgot about 
women.. The recess was drawing to 
a close and the priest Leros had his 
list of names in hand and was about 
to read from it once more. 

“Rudolph Thadbury — Thomas 
the Grabber.*’ 

Thadbury, with the air of a mili- 
tary leader, saluted both Leros and 
Thomas with his sword. Thomas 
gave his spear an indefinite wave 
that might or might not have been a 
response, then leveled it and moved 
forward. Schoenberg watched the 
action critically. He thought he was 
already beginning — only beginning, 
of course — to appreciate how a duel 
with edged and pointed weapons 
should be fought. 

Since a sword has not a spear’s 
range of attack Rudolph slid aside 
from the deep thrusts and hacked 
at the shaft of the spear when he 
could, trying to sever the spearhead 
and to move inside the spear’s most 
effective range to a lesser distance, 
where the advantage would lie with 
the swordsman. All this was not 
very different from what Schoen- 
berg had expected. He had read 
historians’ theoretical treatments of 
personal combat, and had watched 
Anachronists on Earth playing with 
their dull weapons. He had never 
taken up one of their wooden 
swords, though; he did not care for 
playing much. 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



81 




Thadbury had no success in 
hacking at the spear shaft, for it 
was bound with twisted strips of 
metal running lengthwise and the 
sword could not cut through. Nor 
did he get many chances to try; the 
Grabber was plainly a master of his 
chosen weapon. Rudolph could not 
move in to the range at which he 
wished to fight. Thomas kept his 
spear’s long shaft flicking in and 
out, lightly as a serpent’s tongue, 
and still used it handily to parry 
whenever it seemed the sword 
might reach his face or bulky torso. 
And then, suddenly, incredibly, 
Thomas was no longer staying back 
to get the maximum advantage 
from his weapon’s greater range. 
Instead he brushed the sword out of 
the way with the spear shaft and 
leaped in to close with his opponent 
in a wrestler’s grip. 

A cry of surprise went up around 
the ring, and Thadbury too was 
taken off guard. Sword and spear 
fell to the trodden earth together 
and the two men stamped and 
whirled in a grotesque dance, each 
trying to trip and throw the other. 
But Thomas had the advantage of 
strength and skill as well. When 
they fell he was on top, Rudolph 
prone beneath him. Thomas’s mas- 
sive right forearm became a lever to 
crush Rudolph’s wiry neck. Ru- 
dolph, belly down on the ground 
beneath his foe, kicked, wretched, 
and twisted with desperate 
strength. His struggles seemed use- 
less. His face went red, then 
purple. 

Schoenberg thought that what 
was left of the oxygen in his blood- 
stream and lungs must be going 
fast. He hoped the man would be 



speedily out of his pain, even as he 
pushed Celeste back a little and 
stepped slightly to one side to get a 
better look at the coming of death. 
He knew that a lot of people on 
Earth, seeing him standing here 
and watching so intently, would 
think he was a sadist. In fact, he 
wished no living creature suffering. 

Schoenberg wished that he could 
enter the Tournament himself. Of 
course he knew full well that he was 
no more qualified to face such men 
as these with edged weapons, than 
they were to meet him with energy 
ritles. The season before, when he 
had been hunting with Mikenas, 
Mikenas had shown him how to use 
a hunting spear and Schoenberg 
had successfully impaled some dan- 
gerous game on his borrowed wea- 
pon. That had been one of the most 
memorable experiences of his life, 
and he had never mentioned it to 
anyone. 

Of course competing in a Tour- 
nament like this was a far different 
matter. Not that he could reason- 
ably expect to be allowed to enter 
anyway. Maybe he could find out 
just how one qualified in the pre- 
liminaries, and when the next 
planet- wide Tournament was going 
to be held. He assumed there would 
be another one, probably next 
hunting season. Then if he found 
some way to practice on Earth, and 
came back in fifteen years . 
maybe one of these men’s sons 
would kill him then. 

It was unlikely, to put it mildly, 
that he would ever be able to win a 
major Tournament on Hunters’ 
planet, no matter how much prac- 
tice and fair preparation he got in. 
He was not anxious to die, and 



82 



IF 




when he saw violent death ap- 
proaching tie knew that, as in the 
past, he would be afraid. But it 
would be worth it?, worth it, worth 
it. FdT tftfe timeless share of intense 
life to b# experienced before the 
end. For the moments of full per- 
fect being when the coin marked 
Life and Death spun before the 
altar of the god of chance, moments 
more valuable than so many years 
of the dreariness that made up 
most of what men called civiliza- 
tion. 

Now Rudolph could no longer 
strain to throw his killer off, could 
no longer even grate out noises 
from his mouth and throat. His 
face was hideous and inhuman. 
There was no sound now but 
Thomas the Grabber’s honest pant- 
ing. That quieted shortly as Thomas 
sensed the life below him fled. He 
let Rudolph’s head fall, got to his 
feet, very easy and limber in his 
movements for such a bulky man. 

Schoenberg glanced at Celeste, 
who was looking at her fingernails. 
Not horrified by what was going on, 
only mildly disgusted. When he 
looked at her she gave him a quick 
questioning smile. He turned to 
Athena. She was watching the men 
arm themselves for the next fight, 
was deep in her own thoughts. 
Schoenberg and the rest of the out- 
side world had been forgotten. 

De La Torre came ambling up, 
from the direction of the ship, to 
stand beside them. “How’d the last 
one go?” he asked Schoenberg, 
craning his neck a little to view 
the bodies where they had been 
dragged. 

“It went all right. They both 
fought well.” 



7 ann the Nomad — Wull Nar- 
V vaez.” 

This should be the last fight of 
the day. 

Athena turned her head but not 
her eyes to Schoenberg and whis- 
pered: “What are those things on 
his belt?” 

There were two or three pairs of 
them, strung on a cord. “They ap- 
pear to be human ears.” 

De La Torre emitted a high- 
pitched snicker, that made Schoen- 
berg glance over at him for a 
moment, frowning in surprise. 

Vann the Nomad was waving his 
long sword with what seemed to be 
the clumsy movements of an ama- 
teur, but nobody now watching him 
could be taken in by that deception 
for a moment. The show now be- 
came almost comical, for Narvaez, 
too, affected an innocent appear- 
ance. He looked so like a harmless 
peasant that the look must have 
been carefully cultivated. Wull car- 
ried a pitchfork, and made tenta- 
tive jabbing motions with it toward 
his foe. Wull’s dress was crude, and 
his mouth pursed grotesquely, so 
that he looked for all the world like 
some angry, mud-footed farmer 
nerving himself to unfamiliar vio- 
lence. 

The six warriors who had already 
survived the day’s dangers were re- 
laxed now and in a mood for 
humor, enjoying the charade. They 
hooted and whistled at clumsy- 
looking feints, and called out rough 
advice. Leros glanced around at 
them in irritation once, but then to 
Schoenberg’s surprise said nothing. 

With a flash of insight Schoen- 
berg realized that the contestants in 
a Tournament like this one must 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



83 




stand closer to the gods than even a 
priest of Leros’s rank. 

Vann tried several times to cut 
the pitchfork’s shaft, which was not 
armored with metal, but Narvaez 
had a way of turning the fork that 
minimized the swordblade’s im- 
pact, and the wooden shaft seemed 
very springy and tough. When 
Vann’s tactics had failed him sev- 
eral times he tried something new; 
grabbing at the fork with his free 
hand. He was so fast that on his 
first attempt he managed to seize 
the weapon, getting a good grip on 
it just where the tines branched 
out. With this grip he pulled the 
surprised Wul Narvaez off balance 
while his sword thrust low and 
hard. 

He took the ears of Narvaez be- 
fore the man was dead, warning the 
maul-slave off with a snarl, until he 
had made sure of undamaged 
trophies. 

athena, blinking, came back to 
full awareness of her surround- 
ings once again. She looked for 
Schoenberg, and saw that he had 
turned away and was waiting to 
talk to the High Priest Andreas, 
who had just come in sight on the 
road that descended from the 
mountaintop, walking with a small 
escort of soldiers. 

De La Torre, moving closer to 
Athena, asked her in a low voice: 
“Did you get that last little bit?” 

“What?” Not having under- 
stood, she turned to him with a 
look of expectancy. 

“I was talking about the ear- 
cutting, whether you got that part 
down on crystal. I’ve been making 
a few recordings too.” 



The expectancy in her face dim- 
med, then vanished abruptly as 
realization came. The crystal on 
which her day’s anthropological 
records were to hpye been made 
still hung unused at her belt. 



andreas, after having made a 
/V short congratulatory speech to 
the surviving warriors, turned 
quickly to Schoenberg and inquir- 
ed: “Have you enjoyed the day’s 
competition?” 

“We who are here have enjoyed it 
very much. I must apologize for 
Suomi, the one who became ill, as 
you may have heard. I do not think 
he will come to watch again.” 

Andreas’s lip curled slightly but 
he made no further comment. None 
was needed. Such a man was be- 
neath contempt and unworthy of 
discussion. He asked: “Will all of 
you join me at a feast in the Temple 
of Thorun tonight? All of you, that 
is, who are now here. We can as- 
cend at once to the city if that is 
convenient.” 

Schoenberg hesitated only mar- 
ginally. “I did not think to bring a 
gift for Thorun with me from the 
ship.” 

Andreas smiled. What was the 
naive old saying? If a smile dis- 
figures a man’s face, then that man 
is bad. The High Priest said: “lam 
sure you will provide a suitable gift. 
There is no hurry about it, not 
now.” 

“Very well.” Schoenberg glanced 
at those of his shipmates present. 
All watched him expectantly and 
appeared perfectly ready to be Tho- 
run’s guests. “Just let me say a 
word to the people waiting at the 



84 



IF 




ship. Only take a minute.” 

“Of course.” Andreas, noble 
savage, turned politely away. 

Schoenberg took his communica- 
tor from his belt and spoke into it. 
Looking toward the ship he thought 
he could just see the head of Suomi, 
who must be sitting down in his 
sentry’s position at the top of the 
climbing path. 

It was Barbara who answered. 
“Hello?” Her voice was uncertain. 

“Look, Barb, those of us down 
here now have been invited up to 
visit the Temple. A feast is sched- 
uled. I’m not sure when we’ll get 
back to the ship. Tell Suomi to be 
sure to get inside before dark and 
button the thing up. One of you call 
me if any problems should arise; 
I’ll call you again when we’re ready 
to start back. Okay?” 

There was a little pause, and 
then she only said, “Okay.” 
“Everything all right?” 

“Yes. Okay, Oscar.” 

Just hearing about the Tourna- 
ment and thinking about it must 
have upset her, he supposed. Prob- 
ably she had been holding Suomi’s 
hand while he recounted bestial 
horrors. Well, next trip he. would 
choose his traveling companions 
more carefully. None of this bunch 
were exactly what he had hoped 
for. 

Except next time he might be 
coming here alone, not expecting to 
return to Earth. He wondered if he 
could really teach himself, on 
Earth, to use edged weapons with 
real skill. He wondered if he would 
do better with sword or axe or 
spear. Tonight, if everything went 
well, he would have a chance to 
mention his plan to Andreas. 



T he little party of outworlders 
and their casual escort of a few 
soldiers began to climb the smooth- 
paved mountain road, Andreas and 
Schoenberg walking together in the 
lead. “It is only a few kilometers to 
the top,” Andreas informed them. 
“Perhaps an hour’s walk if we take 
our time. Your hours on Earth are 
about the same length as ours, not 
so?” 

When they had walked only 
about half a kilometer along the 
zig-zag, climbing road they came to 
the place where, as Andreas point- 
ed out, the ring was being prepared 
for the next day’s fighting. Here the 
mountain was steeper, less level 
space was available, and one side of 
the ring overlooked a bank that was 
almost a precipice. After another 
kilometer the switchback road 
passed between twin stone watch- 
towers from which sentinels saluted 
the party crisply with their spears. 
Andreas returned the salutes. 

They must be nearing the 
summit now. The slope of the 
mountain moderated again and the 
road wound through a park-like 
wood. Many of the trees bore fruit. 
The earth below them was hidden 
under a vine-like groundcover plant 
that put up leaves like blades of 
grass. 

Presently the trees thinned out, 
the ground leveled and they came 
in sight of the citadel-city on the 
mountain’s crown. As the road 
brought them near the city’s bone- 
white walls, straight toward a yawn- 
ing gate, Schoenberg glanced back 
once in the direction of the ship. He 
was developing a faint uneasiness 
that he found hard to shake. He 
could see only the top of the metal 



BERSERKER’S PLANET

sphere above the trees before he 
passed into the city. 

Inside, there was at first little to 
be seen, except more walls of bright 
white stone. As they made their way 
in through the streets, Schoenberg 
found them narrow and busy. Gray- 
clad slaves, and carts pulled by 
multihorned draft animals, made 
way for white-robed aristocrats. 
Here and there an elegant woman 
eyed the visitors from a sedan chair 
or a grilled window. Windows were 
usually small, doors usually kept 
closed, walls invariably white. 
There was a deadly sameness to the 
architecture of the city. Catching 
Andreas’s eye, Schoenberg asked: 
“May we take pictures here?” 

“Of course. You must take one 
of me, later. I shall treasure it.” 

The white-garbed lords of the 
planet were lining the visitors’ path 
now in considerable numbers, bow- 
ing lightly and courteously, show- 
ing somewhat more curiosity than 
Schoenberg had ever before seen 
displayed by Hunterians. Athena 
was smiling and waving to the 
women and children in white who 
were visible peering from windows 
or around corners. Those in gray, 
male and female, generally seemed 
too hurried to look up. It occurred 
to Schoenberg that there were no 
gray-clad children visible. 

“The Temple of Thorun.” 
Andreas had stopped and was 
pointing to a pair of high gates of 
heavy metal grillwork that guarded 
the entrance to a courtyard lined on 
three sides by buildings of the ubi- 
quitous white. These were some- 
what taller than any of the visitors 
had passed on their way through 
the city. 



“There we will feast tonight.” 

O nce the party had passed 
through the gates, Andreas 
bade the visitors a temporary good- 
bye, and himself went on toward 
the building that Schoenberg took 
to be the Temple proper, the tallest 
structure, some twelve or fifteen 
meters high, with broad white steps 
and forbidding doors. 

The outworlders were guided by 
bowing young priests into another 
nearby building and there shown to 
individual rooms, all of which were 
out of sight of the street, opening 
onto a kind of formal garden in an 
enclosed court. 

Led into his room by the obse- 
quious manservant assigned to him, 
Schoenberg found it a small but 
pleasant place. The small window 
was protected by an ornamental 
grill, soft rugs covered the floor, 
and there was a comfortable-look- 
ing bed. An invitation to stay over- 
night seemed to be in the cards. His 
manservant was laying out white 
garments produced from some- 
where, and through the open door 
other servants were visible, carrying 
in haste what appeared to be a 
bathtub. 

A little later, getting his back 
scrubbed — hardly necessary, but 
let them do things their way — he 
found that the unexpected degree 
of hospitality had to some e#t£(it al- 
layed the unease that had begun to 
nag him. Now, though, he inspect- 
ed that Andreas was goiqg to ask 
him some rather large favof before 
they parted. What could it be? 
Probably to smuggle in some out- 
world weapons, something needed 
to reduce some particularly trouble- 



IF 




some adversary.' 

The swift tropical Hunterian 
night had come on by the time he 
had finished bathing and dressing. 
A young priest was promptly at 
hand to conduct him to the feast; it 
seemed that everything was running 
on a smooth schedule. 

With a word to his guide he 
stopped at Athena’s room, next to 
his, and found her ready to join 
him, as prompt as when they went 
off on a business trip. Her guide 
had told her that De La Torre and 
Celeste, whose rooms were next 
along a covered walk, had already 
gone on ahead. 

Joking a little about what sort of 
merchandise they might hope to 
sell to their new client Andreas, 
Schoenberg and Athena followed 
their guides from one courtyard 
and cloister to another without 
being brought again in sight of the 
city’s streets. Evidently the Temple 
complex was extensive. 

At last they entered a small door 
in the flank of the tall building 
Schoenberg recognized as the 
Temple itself and were led down to 
a large room a short distance below 
ground level. It was refreshingly 
cool after the day’s sunlit warmth. 

Already at table were De La 
Torre and Celeste, also garbed in 
white, De La Torre with a leafy gar- 
land on his head like some ancient 
Roman. With them sat the High 
Priest, and half a dozen other men 
all of the highest rank. Some of 
these had accompanied Andreas on 
his first welcoming visit to the out- 
worlders’ ship. 

Servants moved quietly and 
efficiently about. The banquet 
room^ras large, pleasingly decorat- 



ed with fine hangings, softly lit with 
well-placed candles. All was as it 
should be. 

“Our host has been telling me 
about Thorun’s great hall,” said 
De La Torre, after greetings had 
been exchanged. 

“So?’’ Schoenberg moved a hand 
around in an inclusive gesture. “Is 
this the place?’’ 

One of the Inner Circle priests 
grinned, broadly and cynically. 
“No, Thorun’s is really quite a dif- 
ferent world from ours. Or yours.’’ 

as at the Tournament, Schoen- 
/V berg, when seated, found him- 
self between Athena and Celeste. 
Here, despite the outwardly pleas- 
ant surroundings, not only Celeste 
but Athena kept drawing close to 
him, as if unconsciously. Not only 
were there no other women guests 
this evening, but Schoenberg had 
the feeling that there might never 
have been any in the history of the 
Temple. Andreas and the other 
Hunterian leaders never spoke to 
Athena unless she asked them a di- 
rect question, which she did of 
course from time to time to show 
her nerve. Celeste, being a good 
playgirl, knew when she was ex- 
pected to keep quiet. If the Hun- 
terians knew her real status, 
Schoenberg supposed, they would 
be outraged. 

No doubt about it, his party was 
being accorded extraordinary treat- 
ment. He would have to at least ap- 
pear to agree to their request when 
it came, whatever it might be. 

The feast was elaborate and very 
good, though Schoenberg with an 
apologetic explanation to Andreas 
advised the other outworlders not 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



87 




to partake of certain dishes, nor of 
the fermented milk that was 
brought before them in great bowls. 
“It will be better for our Earthly 
stomachs if we drink clear water 
here, if Thorun does not object.” 

Andreas waved a negligent hand. 
“Thorun is largely indifferent to 
such matters. Clear water is always 
a good warriors’ drink.” 

Schoenberg sipped his water, 
from a golden cup. “I look forward 
to seeing the next round of the 
Tournament.” 

“I, too. I am delighted that our 
interests coincide. Unfortunately 
business has prevented me from 
seeing any of the earlier rounds.” 

“I know what the press of 
business can be like.” 

Celeste’s foot was tapping under 
the table. Dancers had come on the 
scene and she was watching them 
with professional interest. They 
were good, girls and youths danc- 
ing together, the show very crude 
by Earth standards of course, and 
too bluntly erotic in places, but well 
practiced and full of energy. The 
Hunterian men at table watched 
the show with somewhat grim ex- 
pressions, or did not watch it at all. 
Schoenberg wondered if priests 
here were supposed to be celibate. 
He would get around to asking that 
later, if at all. Sex on any planet 
was likely to be an even more sensi- 
tive subject than religion, which 
these religious leaders did not ap- 
pear to take too seriously. 

All was new and interesting to 
the outworlders and the evening 
passed quickly for them. The night 
was well advanced, the candles 
burning low, and the dancers liter- 
ally collapsed from exhaustion. 



when Schoenberg suggested that 
the time had come for him and his 
party to return to their ship. 

Andreas made a gesture of polite 
disapproval. “Your beds here have 
been prepared. One of the dancing 
girls yonder will share yours with 
you if you like.” 

“The offer is most pleasing. But 
I am concerned about my ship.” 
“Stay here. Spend the night 
under Thorun’s roof. You and I 
have much more to talk about. And 
it would be unpleasant, trying to 
climb the tall rock at night to reach 
your ship.” 

Schoenberg did not take long to 
make up his mind. “We accept 
your invitation gladly. If you will 
excuse me, though, I must talk 
briefly to the people on the ship.” 
He took the communicator from his 
belt, activated it, waited for an 
answer. None was immediately 
forthcoming. He raised the device 
to his mouth and spoke. “Suomi?” 
“Stay here,” said Andreas, mak- 
ing his face hideous with his smile. 
“In the morning I will try to facili- 
tate your meeting with him.” 

“You will try ... I do not under- 
stand.” 

“You see, the man you left to 
guard your ship is there no longer. 
It is shafcieful but necessary to ex- 
plain that while the last round of 
the Tournament was in progress he 
took fright and fled from that 
place. I did not wish to worry you 
unnecessarily, but we ha’^e not yet 
managed to locate him.” 

Schoenberg sat up straight, giv- 
ing Andreas his best tycoon’s look. 
“And what about my ship?” 

“We are guarding it for you. 
Nothing in it will be damaged. No

VIII 

S hortly after the next morn- 
ing’s dawn a slave came around 
to waken the eight survivors of the 
Tournament. 

Giles the Treacherous, roused in- 
stantly by the light tug on his sleep- 
ing robe, rolled over, remembered 
fully where he was, and came 
awake with something of a start. 
Sitting up, he rubbed sleep from 
his eyes and looked about him, 
then observed to anyone who cared 
to listen: “Our camp is growing 
somewhat smaller day by day.” 
Though most of the seven others 
were awake, none of them chose to 
respond immediately. Like Giles, 
they had simply wrapped them- 
selves in robes or blankets for sleep., 
and now there was a general slow 
emergence, as of a gathering of in- 
sects from cocoons. 

It had rained a little during the 
night. The morning was gray and 
cheerless. On the previous evening 
the eight warriors had bedded 
down quite close together, as if by 
common consent against some ex- 
ternal danger. The space they now 
occupied was tiny indeed compared 
with that of the first fine encamp- 
ment beside the river far below. 

When Giles stood up the river 
was visible to him down there, bend 
after bend of it snaking across the 
flat country until it lost itself at last 
in fields of morning mist. Down 
there croplands made ragged rec- 
tangles. For a moment — a moment 
onfy — Giles wished with the inten- 



sity of physical pain that he was 
somewhere in his own remote pro- 
vince, striding stupidly behind a 
plow, as once he had done, long 
ago. 

Long ago. 

Omir Kelsumba, giant and 
black, was standing a few paces 
away and preparing to empty his 
bladder down the hill. The slaves 
had not gotten around to digging a 
latrine for this campsite before 
most of them were for some reason 
called away to other duties, yester- 
day afternoon. Omir spoke over his 
shoulder to answer Giles at last: 
“Tonight we will need less space 
still, but what of that? Soon all of 
us will be dwelling in Thorun’s hall, 
where there must be room enough 
for any man.” 

“Well spoken,” commended Far- 
ley of Eikosk, standing tall to 
stretch, then bending and with deft 
movements of his freckled arms 
starting to roll up his sleeping robe. 
Like his weapons, it looked costly. 

By now all of the warriors were 
up, busy scratching, stretching, 
spitting, rolling their sleeping robes 
in preparation for moving camp. 
Farley of Eikosk went to offer a 
prolonged obeisance before the 
altar of Thorun, kneeling and mur- 
muring prayers, bending his fore- 
head to the ground. Soon Kel- 
sumba joined him, and then 
Charles the Upright, and then one 
by one the others, until all had 
offered at least perfunctory wor- 
ship. The enigmatic face of the 
little image of Thorun showed no 
sign of favoring any. 

Vann the Nomad was hungriest 
this morning, it seemed, being first 
to leave the shrine and move toward 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



89 




the cooking fire where a single 
gray-clad slave was preparing what 
looked like a very simple morning 
meal. 

As Vann moved away, Giles said 
in a low voice to Kelsumba: “What 
do you think of that one, cutting 
ears for trophies?” Kelsumba only 
grunted in reply. He had begun to 
inspect his axe, checking to see if 
the night’s rain had gotten through 
its carefully wound and oiled wrap- 
pings to rust the steel. Except for 
the axe, everything Kelsumba own- 
ed was shabby and worn. 

While crouching over his axe and 
looking at it closely, he said to 
Giles: “You are perhaps a wise 
man. Maybe you can give me an 
opinion on this. Suppose I do not 
win the Tournament. Even so, 
having come this far, I will be 
seated high up at Thorun’s table. 
Will he listen to me, do you sup- 
pose? If I die today or tomorrow 
will he intercede with the goddess 
of healing to grant a favor for me?” 

Giles gave a little private sigh. 
“Such a question is beyond me,” he 
answered. “But it is generally be- 
lieved that all wounds, old or new, 
are healed when one enters Tho- 
run’s hall, whatever one’s rank in- 
side.” 

“Oh, it is not my own wounds 
that have brought me here.” The 
big man looked up and turned 
vacant eyes into the distance. “I 
have a wife and two little ones, far 
away. The babies are both sick, 
they waste and do not grow. The 
village doctors can do nothing. I 
pleaded with the gods, offered sac- 
rifice, but the children did not get 
better.” His eyes swung around to 
Giles, and his fingers moved upon 



the handle of his axe. “So I will be- 
come a god myself. Then I will be 
able to make my children well, even 
if I cannot live with them any long- 
er.” His voice was rising and his 
look had become the stare of a fa- 
natic. “I will kill six men, or sixty if 
need be! I will kill you, and Thorun 
himself will not be able to stop 
me!” 

Giles nodded gravely, signifying 
agreement, keeping his face immo- 
bile. Then 4ie turned carefully 
away. When he glanced back a mo- 
ment later, Kelsumba was sitting 
there quietly again, honing his axe. 

Thomas the Grabber, who had 
been standing only a little distance 
off when Giles made his remark 
about Vann’s ear-cutting propensi- 
ties, had probably heard the com- 
ment. It was Thomas who should 
be due to oppose the ear-cutter in 
this day’s round of fighting, but 
Thomas, looking sleepy this morn- 
ing, seemed not at all disturbed. 
Now he was yawning, with a kind of 
cavernous bellow. It was hard to 
say whether Kelsumba or the 
Grabber was the biggest of the sur- 
viving men. Jud Isaksson was cer- 
tainly the smallest, with Giles not 
much larger. The latter sighed once 
more to himself as he made this 
assessment. 

B reakfast consisted of thick 
tasteless fried cakes and water. 
For the first time there was no 
meat. When the men growled at the 
slave who served them, he indicated 
by a few grunts and helpless ges- 
tures— someone had once cut out 
his tongue — that nothing better 
had been provided and he was 
having to do more work than usual 



90 



IF 




because most of his fellows had 
been called away. 

Leros confirmed this, scowling as 
he munched his own share of the 
fried cakes. “Two priests who are 
my friends came down to rouse me 
early this morning, to sympathize 
with me that most of our retinue 
has been taken away. There is no 
excuse for giving us such meager 
service. True, our numbers are re- 
duced, but the glory of you who sur- 
vive has grown the greater. I have 
sent up a protest to the High Priest. 
I trust we will be better fed, and at- 
tended, by midday.’* 

Breakfast, such as it was, having 
been disposed of, Leros gave the 
order to march and the party began 
once more to ascend. Far ahead of 
them a train of freight wagons load- 
ed with provender for the city went 
groaning slowly up the road. An- 
other, of empty, rattling carts, 
came clattering more quickly down. 
Charles the Upright, who happen- 
ed to be walking in the van, had to 
reach for his sword before the surly 
driver of the first descending cart 
would lead the train of vehicles 
fairly off the road to let the climb- 
ing heroes pass. 

Leros’s irritation was increased 
by the incident, but he said little 
and the party hiked on. Certainly it 
was true that they no longer made 
an impressive sight. The men were 
all bedraggled after days spent in 
the field and they were practically 
unattended. He had felt like 
stopping to flog that insolent varlet 
of a driver, but such a job would 
only demean the whole proceeding 
further. 

The city of Thorun was not yet 
visible, though the summit of Gods- 



mountain could hardly be more 
than a kilometer above them now. 
Once Giles caught a glimpse of the 
huge outworld ship, gleaming wetly 
on its distant pedestal of rock, but 
then rain and fog blew in between, 
and trees closed in again around 
the road on which they Climbed. 



T wo priests of intermediate rank 
came down to meet Leros and 
talk with him. The three of them, 
conferring privately, walked on 
ahead of the eight warriors. The 
eight continued to climb calmly 
and steadily, sometimes two or 
three walking together long enough 
to exchange a few words, some- 
times all of them strung out, each 
in his solitary introspective silence. 
A ragged pair of slaves, all that re- 
mained of their once princely 
retinue, bore burdens in the rear. 
One slave was dumb and the other 
limped on a crippled leg. The 
image of Thorun, for which a field 
shrine had been built at every camp 
thus far, had now been left behind. 
Temporarily, Leros said, until they 
should have servants again to build 
a decent shrine. 

Shortly after the near-incident of 
the carts, Giles the Treacherous 
sought out Jud Isaksson who had 
been trudging alone and walked 
companionably beside the man who 
in a few hours would be trying to 
kill him. Jud acknowledged his pre- 
sence with a glance and then went 
back to his own thoughts. 

Casting a glance back at their 
beggarly force of servants, Giles re- 
marked: “So, no meat. And it also 
seems there will be no musicians to- 
day, to waft our souls upward to 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



91 




Thorun’s hall.” 

Jud shrugged uneasily. Perhaps 
it was only the wet wind blowing 
rain against his neck that made 
him do so. 

Giles measured out half a dozen 
strides of road beneath his boots, 
and then added: “I know only this. 
Sixty-four brave fighting men, all 
full of life and blood and valiant 
deeds, met on the plain below. And 
now there are just eight of us with 
breath* still in us. Then , when we 
still might have turned around and 
gone home, we were greeted and 
praised as heroes. Now? No one be- 
holds our deeds, or will ever sing of 
them. And are the dead fifty-six in 
truth now at their feasting up 
above?” He looked toward the 
mountaintop concealed amid its 
groves. “I hear no sounds of laugh- 
ter down the wind.” 

Jud’s mustache moved, but he 
only spat. 

Giles was determined not to let 
things drag on; time was growing 
short. He said, trying almost at 
random now to provoke a reaction: 
“You and I have seen those fifty-six 
good men go up in smoke. No, not 
even that. They have not all been 
burnt, as heroes should be, but 
buried for the most part like dead 
animals. In shallow graves.” 

“Man.” Jud found his voice at 
last. “Man, I know not why you re- 
hearse these things to me. Tell 
me — I know nothing of you but 
your name — is it for no reason at all 
that you are called Giles the 
Treacherous?” 

“That is a long story, and not too 
easy of belief. I will begin it if you 
like.” 

“No, I care not. A true scoundrel 



would probably call himself Giles 
the Honest. All right!” Jud came 
visibly to a decision. “All right! If 
you want plain speaking. A child 
should know there are no gods on 
top of this mountain, or anywhere 
else. That being so, who really does 
rule the Temple, Godsmountain, 
the world? The simple answer is, 
that they are ruled by men.” 

He nodded, smiling with satis- 
faction at his own logic, and then 
plunged on. “Very well. Since we’re 
not going to be welcomed into some 
imaginary hall, the question arises, 
why are we here? There must be a 
real reason. T’would be senseless to 
have us kill one another off to the 
last man for the amusement of a 
few outworlders who happened by. 
No. Mark my words. Before this 
day’s duelling starts — or at worst 
before it’s over — the six or eight of 
us who’re left will be let in on the 
secret, and the Tournament will be 
secretly stopped.” 

“You really think that.” 

“Man, what else? We’re going 
into some elite, secret force. 
They’ve already stopped sending 
down supplies for us right? The 
Tournament will be halted, and 
some story put out telling who the 
final winner was and how he’s 
happily guzzling and wenching with 
the gods,” 

“The good Leros must be an ex- 
cellent actor.” 

“Maybe he hasn’t been told. A 
good man and all that, but not the 
brightest. It’s plain enough if you 
only look at it, consider all the 
facts. We’re going into some kind 
of palace guard, for the High Priest 
and whoever else is really running 
things atop this mountain.” 



92 



IF 




When Jud fell silent, Giles also 
had no more to say for a little while, 
though he was thinking rapidly. At 
last he replied: “You may be right. 
1 only know that I would give much 
to be able to turn my own steps 
quietly downhill at this moment 
and retrace them to my home.” 
“You speak madness, Giles. 
Once you have come this far they 
would never let you go. Where is 
your home?” 

“Endross Swamp.” It was a re- 
mote province, far to the south. 
“The writ of Godsmountain does 
not run there with much effect.” 
“Sol have heard. In fact I would 
have thought that place was full of 
Thorun’s enemies.” Jud was staring 
at him. “Why are you here?” 

“I am no enemy of Thorun,” 
Giles said at once, and firmly. “It 
may be that some of his priests are 
not as worthy and honest as they 
should be. As to why I am here, 
well, I am now asking that question 
of myself.” 

Up ahead the priests had 
stopped, still deep in their discus- 
sion. Leros was gesturing angrily, 
while the other two appeared un- 
happy but resigned. They had 
reached the next ring prepared for 
fighting. Giles saw that it had been 
made with a portion of its rim over- 
looking an almost precipitous 
slope. As he stared, he felt a chill 
sensation near his heart. In the 
south they thought that meant a 
man had laid eyes on the place 
where he would die. 

“What did I tell you?” Jud was 
murmuring, nudging Giles with an 
elbow. Leros had turned around as 
they came up, and was about to 
speak to the warriors. But some- 



thing in Leros’s attitude had chang- 
ed, and they all recognized at once 
that he was not simply going to an- 
nounce another round of fighting. 
Something else impended. 



I eros was angry, but not at the 
j warriors, not at the gloomy 
priests who stood beside him. 
When he spoke his voice was tense. 
“First I am instructed to ask, whe- 
ther, when the outworlders were 
with us yesterday, any of them 
mentioned the name of the demi- 
god Karlsen.” 

The warriors all exchanged 
mildly puzzled looks. Most of them 
could not remember anything the 
outworlders had said: they all had 
more important things to think 
about. This was hardly the an- 
nouncement Jud had expected, and 
he was frowning. 

All were silent until Giles put up 
a hi nd and asked: “Good Leros, 
are these outworlders then accused 
of some blasphemy?” 

“That is being decided up 
above,” said one of the other 
priests, gesturing toward the sum- 
mit. 

“Tell Andreas to decide it up 
there, then,” said Leros tartly. 
“And let me get on with more im- 
portant business here.” 

“Lord Leros, your pardon. I re- 
peat again, I and many others are 
sympathetic to your views. I am 
only relaying orders — ” 

“Yes.” Again Leros address- 
ed the waiting warriors. “Those 
above see fit to bother us with a 
second triviality. One of the out- 
worlders, the one who behaved like 
a frightened woman when he saw 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



93 




blood, has wandered off. It is 
thought he must still be on the 
mountain, for soldiers patrolling in 
the flatlands have not found him. I 
must ask whether any of you have 
caught sight of such a person either 
last night or today.” 

Giles signed that he had not. The 
other seven, by now were almost 
totally uninterested, also gave 
mutely negative responses. 

Leros turned back to the other 
priests. “Do not these outworlders 
carry devices for talking one to the 
other, even when they are kilo- 
meters apart? How can one be lost 
if he can tell the others where he 
is?” 

One of the other priests said: 
“Such a device was found near 
their ship. The coward must have 
dropped it. Anyway, in my opinion 
he does not want to be found. 
Other even stranger things were 
found there also, and there is more 
going on than we have been told.” 
The priest’s voice dropped almost 
to a whisper. Giles feigned a bore- 
dom as great as that of the other 
fighting men around him, and he 
kept his eyes on a little flying crea- 
ture in a tree, but meanwhile his 
ears grasped for every word. 

The priest continued his pri- 
vate — he thought — conversation 

with Leros: “The other outworlders 
are said to be guests in the Temple 
precincts but no one believes they 
remain there by choice. Very few 
people have seen them since they 
entered. One of their women seems 
to be confined aboard their ship. 
More, and stranger — one that I 
shall not name has told me of a 
most surprising rumor; the demi- 
god Mjollnir went forth to chal- 



lenge the outworlders, and one of 
them slew him.” 

Leros made a disgusted sound 
and turned his back. “And I had 
been on the verge of giving credence 
to these stories you bring.” 

“Oh, I do not credit that about 
Mjollnir myself. Certainly not! 
Blasphemous. But something 
strange is going on, something to 
do with the outworlders, and we 
have not been told the truth about 
it.” 

“That may well be. But it has 
nothing to do with me or with this 
Tournament.” Leros squinted up 
the road. “When may we expect 
better food and drink, and some 
new servants?” 

The third priest looked un- 
happier than before. “Lord Leros, 
again I must give you an answer 
that you will not like.” 

Leros swung around. “What 
now?” His tone was ominous. 

“It is as if the Inner Circle has 
suddenly forgotten about the Tour- 
nament. Not simply that they are 
busy with other things, but that 
they no longer care about it. I could 
get no promise that the rations sent 
down would be improved. Andreas 
I saw only briefly, and he was pre- 
occupied with other matters, I 
know not what. He said to me: ‘Bid 
Leros get on with his show, and 
finish up.’ How can I question the 
High Priest?” 

Leros’s hand went unthinkingly 
to his side, where a warrior’s belted 
sword would hang, found only the 
smooth white priestly robe. “My 
show? Were those his words?” 

“On my honor, they were.” 
“Well, / can question what An- 
dreas ordefs.” Leros spoke in cold 



94 



IF 




rage, his words quiet and calcu- 
lated. “High Priest or not. What 
else will he take from us? Why not 
all our slaves and food, why not our 
clothes and weapons as well?” The 
other priests looked as if they were 
trying not to hear. Giles was 
holding his breath in concentration. 

Leros went on: “Is this or is it not 
supposed to be a Tournament 
pleasing to Thorun and worthy of 
him, intended to select a man who 
is worthy of apotheosis? Are not 
these eight remaining champions, 
each and every one, the finest . 
Words failed Leros for the moment. 
Indeed he seemed near strangula- 
tion. At last he managed to draw a 
deep breath and resume. “Very 
well. I must go up and question 
him myself on these matters. One 
of you two must stay here for a 
while, that these men be not left 
unattended by any of high rank.” 

Turning then to the eight waiting 
warriors, Leros lost his scowl and 
faced them with a sad and loving 
smile. “Good lords — good men. I 
must leave you for a while. Do you 
wish to go on with this round of 
fighting or wait for my return? I am 
going up the hill to argue for better 
treatment. There is no telling when 
I will get back.” 

The men looked at one another 
uncertainly. Giles almost spoke, 
and then bit back the words. His 
mind was racing, trying to balance 
probabilities. He wanted a delay, 
but not too much of one. 

Leros, seeing their uncertainty, 
glanced at the high bronze shield 
that was Hunters’ sun trying to 
burn its way through layers of mist. 
“Wait until the hour of noon,” he 
told them. “If I am not back by 



then, with better honors and provi- 
sions for you — or have not sent 
word — then fight on as best you 
can.” Handing over his list of 
names to the priest who had been 
chosen to stay with the men, and 
beckoning the others to come 
along, he started at a brisk pace up 
the hill. 



T he long morning dragged slowly 
by. Until the middle of the day 
the warriors stood or lounged 
around, gloomily silent or convers- 
ing two or three together in low 
voices. At last, when it was plain 
that noon had come and gone and 
there had been no word from Leros 
and no sign of his return, the sub- 
stitute priest cleared his throat and 
called the eight together. In a some- 
what awkward little speech he in- 
troduced himself as Yelgir, and an- 
nounced that he was ready to call 
the roll if they were prepared to 
fight. 

“Let us get on with it,” said 
Vann the Nomad. Others nodded 
their readiness. Waiting and uncer- 
tainty were harder to bear than 
blows. They took their places 
around the ring. 

Yelgir took out the roll of names 
and cleared his throat once more. 
“Charles the Upright — Farley of 
Eikosk.” 

From their opposite sides of the 
ring Charles and Farley advanced 
in almost leisurely fashion. In the 
center they touched weapons care- 
fully, each man showing respect for 
the other’s abilities, and began a 
cautious sparring. Farley’s wound- 
ed left hand, that Leros himself had 
neatly splinted and bandaged, did 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



95 




not appear to be causing him any 
trouble except that he opened the 
fight with sword alone, leaving his 
dagger in his belt. 

Gradually the fighters added 
speed and strength to their move- 
ments until the long swords rang 
musically. The contest seemed 
quite even between them. Then 
Farley’s jewel-bright steel dipped in 
a flashy feint he had not used in any 
earlier round of fighting. Charles 
tried to parry the stroke that did 
not come, and missed the deadly 
one that did; he fell to earth with 
one bright shriek of pain. 

“Giles the Treacherous — Jud 
Isaksson.’’ 

Jud, as before, charged out 
quickly. Giles did not seem nearly 
so eager, but still this fight began at 
a faster tempo than had the pre- 
vious one. Both men were active, 
but neither would commit himself 
utterly to an attack. Now Giles 
became the more aggressive; his 
long sword lanced above and below 
the smaller man’s round shield, but 
did not manage to get around it. 
And now Isaksson’s blows fell thick 
and fast and Giles was forced to 
spend his energy in parrying, and 
then to give ground before the on- 
slaught. 

The end came suddenly when 
Giles was backed against the rim of 
the fighting circle that overhung 
the downhill slope. Jud’s blade 
flashed, a mere glint of light, and 
Giles clutched at his chest, gave a 
choked cry, fell. On the steep turfy 
incline his body slid and tumbled a 
score of meters before a bush 
caught and held it momentarily. 
Then it pulled loose and slid on 
again. The priest beckoned. The 



limping slave with the maul began 
the long climb down. 

“Omir Kelsumba — Rahim So- 
sias.” 

The black giant seemed to grow 
even larger upon entering the ring. 
Again he carried his great axe 
cradled in his two arms almost ten- 
derly. Against him, fat Sosias with 
his curved sword looked terribly 
overmatched. But the scimitar drew 
first blood. It was a light wound, a 
mere touch with the point along the 
outside of Kelsumba’s thigh. 
Sosias’s timing had been perfect; 
the riposte with the axe only tore 
the edge of his loose outer garment. 

The wound galvanized the black 
man, and now Sosias had to go 
jumping back, paunch jiggling as 
he danced with marvelous speed. 
Shift and flash went the axe, and 
shift and flash again, moving with 
the speed and control of a light 
sword, though the heaviest sword 
could not have held it in a parry. A 
light murmur of awe went around 
the watching circle. 

Sosias tried the cut at the thighs 
again, or feinted doing so. This 
time the riposte came out a little 
farther after him, yet he miracu- 
lously managed to cut his own 
movement short at the critical 
instant and slide away untouched. 
His concealed knife had come out 
into his left hand, but he was un- 
able now to get close enough to use 
it. 

It would be suicidal to simply 
wait and try to keep dodging that 
axe. Sosias must try to attack 
again, and at last the great axe 
caught him coming in, and wiped 
away his face. Thomas the 
Grabber, leaning on his spear some 



96 



IF 




ten meters distant, felt warm drop- 
lets of blood splash on his arm. 

46nP HOMAS Grabber — Vann 

X the Nomad.” 

Vann with his clumsy-looking 
grip on his long sword faced Tho- 
mas, who probingly sent his hupe 
spear darting out and back. Vann 
wasted no energy in trying to be- 
head the spear, the armored shaft 
of which had proved itself already 
in several fights. The fight develop- 
ed quite slowly at first, both men 
moving cautiously, with many feints 
and no real effort at attaek. 

After a while it became apparent 
to expert eyes — no other kind were 
watching now — that Vann could 
not entirely rid himself of the affec- 
tation of holding his sword awk- 
wardly between exchanges. Cer- 
tainly he got it back into the proper 
position with amazing speed, but 
the fraction of a heartbeat wasted 
in this correction was more than 
could be spared in competition at 
this level. The awkward grip was 
not a natural attitude for Vann, 
like Kelsumba’s peculiar way of 
holding his axe, but a pose practic- 
ed to put an opponent off guard. As 
such it was utterly useless now, as 
Vann knew full well; he did not 
want to use it, but his nerves and 
muscles would forget and fall into 
the pattern. 

Thomas timed this lapse and re- 
covery several times, then caught 
the long sword drooping on the 
downbeat. With a sound like a 
club’s impact the spear rammed 
through Vann’s tattered shirt and 
torso, a little above his trophied 
belt. Vann’s face bore a look of wit- 



less grief when he saw the bright 
fountain of his own blood, then 
bore no expression at all. 

F arley of Eikosk, departing 
from that deadly ring in the 
company of his three peers, to re- 
sume their slow trek up the moun- 
tain, was bothered by the eerie feel- 
ing that the gods had forgotten the 
surviving handful of them. Glanc- 
ing back over his shoulder from the 
next bend in the road, he saw the 
stiffening bodies of the day’s four 
victims laid out beside the ring, and 
a single gray-garbed figure with a 
maul at its belt beginning to dig the 
modest pit that would be their 
grave. Isaksson, walking beside 
Farley, kept glancing back also, 
and Isaksson, too, seemed perturb- 
ed about something. Farley almost 
tried to speak of his troubled feel- 
ings, but then said nothing, being 
unsure of how to put them into 
words. 



A few paces ahead, Omir Kel- 
sumba, his huge axe clean and 
sheathed and innocent as some 
woodcutter’s implement, went up 
the endless-seeming hill with easy 
strides. His thoughts were far away, 
with his small unhealthy children 
and his wife. Someday, if he won 
the Tournament, he could perhaps 
return to see his family, drifting as 
a spirit on the night wind, or 
coming with changed appearance 
as a casual traveler. Everyone knew 
that gods could do such things, and 
when he had won the Tournament 
he would be almost a god. 

Earlier there had been occasional 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



97 




doubts, but now the conviction had 
returned that he was going to win. 
He waxed stronger with every vic- 
tory. He could feel the god-strength 
mounting in him. Since he had 
reached his full growth, no man 
had ever been able to stand against 
him, and none could now. When 
the Tournament was over he would 
be a god, and gods could heal as 
well as murder. When he took his 
seat at Thorun’s right hand the 
goddess of healing could not refuse 
to grant him healing for his chil- 
dren. No child of a god was ever 
done to death in a hovel by ill luck 
or mean diseases. 



W alking beside Omir Kel- 
sumba, but guessing nothing 
of his thoughts, Thomas the 
Grabber went up with him stride 
for stride. Despite a lifetime of vio- 
lence as bandit, soldier, body- 
guard, and bounty hunter of dan- 
gerous men, Thomas still fell from 
time to time into the grip of an al- 
most paralyzing fear of bodily in- 
jury and death. Iron control was 
needed to keep his fear from show- 
ing. The fear was on him now, and 
a premonition that he must lose in 
his next fight. There was nothing in 
sight for him beyond the wide blade 
of Kelsumba’s axe, at which he 
dared not look. Thomas was ex- 
perienced enough with this kind of 
fear to know that it would pass if 
only he could manage to hold out 
against it until he had actually 
entered the ring with his opponent. 
Then things would be all right, 
there would be no time for fear. No 
one could stand against him then. 
Now as he climbed he held on 



grimly to his nerve, trying to think 
of nothing. 



T he road came to the twin towers 
from which sentinels saluted 
gravely as the fighters passed. 

“The gods’ private park,” Tho- 
mas muttered aloud, looking 
around him as they continued. The 
road was wider now, bordered with 
fine gravel walks, beyond which 
cultivated green ground-cover vines 
made one continuously inviting 
couch. 

“Yes,” said Farley of Eikosk’s 
reverent voice behind him. “I sup- 
pose we might see Thorun himself 
among those trees.” 

No one answered. Shortly Yelgir, 
their escorting priest, signalled for 
a halt, and led them a little dis- 
tance off the road. The ground of 
softer than before, its area smaller. 
The night was quiet when it came, 
still as the grave, or nearly so. 

IX 

S choenberg, De La Torre, 
Athena, and Celeste were re- 
turned to their comfortable private 
rooms after the feast, but they were 
kept under guard every step of the 
way and all pretense that they were 
free agents had been dropped. No 
one was manhandled, but all were 
searched and their communicators 
taken from them. 

None would speak to them; An- 
dreas had left and no one else was 
willing to answer their protests and 
questions. 

While they were being led from 
the Temple back to their rooms 



98 



IF 




there was time to exchange a few 
words. Schoenberg advised his 
shipmates: “Whatever it is they 
want, they’ll tell us when they’re 
ready. Meanwhile it’s important 
that we all keep our heads.’’ 

“We’ll back you up, Oscar,’’ 
Athena told him. Behind her deter- 
mined face, those of Celeste and De 
La Torre were pale and frightened. 

Schoenberg winked at her. Then 
they were put firmly into their 
separate rooms. He could hear his 
door being locked and barred. His 
personal servant had disappeared 
and when he peered out through 
the grillwork of the window he saw 
that a guard had been stationed 
outside his door. Schoenberg 
stretched out on the comfortable 
bed and tried to think. After a 
while he got up and tried tapping 
messages on the stone wall between 
his room and Athena’s, but there 
was no reply. Probably, the masonry 
was too thick. 

Surprisingly, he slept well and 
felt reasonably rested when he was 
awakened early in the morning. An 
escort of soldiers had come to take 
him to Andreas. He went with them 
eagerly. They re-entered the Temple 
by another of its back doors and 
again went down some steps, this 
time to a cell-like stone chamber 
into which gray morning light filter- 
ed through a single high window. 
Andreas was seated behind a table. 
Schoenberg’s escort saluted and 
went out; he and the ancient and 
ugly High Priest were left alone. 
Andreas was the thinner of the two, 
and biologically much the older, 
but he wore a dagger at the girdle 
of his purplish robe, and seemed 
utterly unconcerned about being 



left alone with a bigger and stronger 
man who had just become his 
enemy. 

Even before the door had closed 
behind the soldiers, Schoenberg 
spoke. “If you are wise, Andreas, 
you will free us at once.’’ 

Andreas calmly gestured to a 
chair, but Schoenberg remained 
standing. The High Priest then 
said: “Before I can dismiss your 
guards I must have assurance that 
you are going to cooperate in the 
project in which we are going to use 
your ship. Your willing cooperation 
will be a great help, though not es- 
sential.’’ 

“Imprisoning me and my friends 
does not make me want to cooper- 
ate. What about the other two 
members of my party — what has 
happened to them?’’ 

Andreas folded his hands on the 
table before him. “The girl is con- 
fined to her stateroom on your ship. 
She is there to speak reassuringly 
over ships’ radio, on the remote 
chance that another spaceship 
should appear and attempt to con- 
tact the Orion." 

“Last night your people threat- 
ened her, frightened her, so that 
when she spoke to me she dared not 
tell me what had happened.’’ 

“She has seen the wisdom of co- 
operation.’’ Andreas spoke mildly. 
“As for the coward, he is still 
missing. Probably he will come to 
no great harm, and will be back 
looking for food today or tomorrow. 

I arri not going to demean my war- 
riors by ordering them to search for 
him.’’ 

After a moment’s silence Schoen- 
berg took the chair that had been 
offered to him earlier. “What 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



99 




exactly do you want me to do?” 

“Answer some questions about 
your ship, its drive in particular, 
and move the ship for us when the 
time comes.” 

There was a little pause. “You 
will have to tell me more than that. 
I do not want to get into serious 
trouble with the outworld autho- 
rities.” 

The High Priest shook his head. 
“Right now I am the only authority 
with whom you must concern your- 
self. Those outside this planet may 
be powerful in their own worlds, 
but they would not care much what 
happens here, even if they could 
know.” 

Schoenberg relaxed a trifle, 
crossed one leg over the other. 
“That is half true, Andreas. They 
do not care about such hunting 
trips as mine, not really. Not 
enough to take the time and trouble 
to prevent them. They would not 
care much about my standing and 
watching your Tournament — or 
even taking part in it, if I could 
have been so honored. But they will 
care, believe me, if I should take 
part in one of your wars, using out- 
world weapons, or even using the 
ship to help you in any military 
way. Doing any such thing would 
be a grave risk for me; not a battle- 
risk, understand, which a man 
should welcome, but a social risk 
when 1 have returned to my own 
people, a risk of dishonor. Being an 
honorable man yourself, you will 
appreciate why I cannot help you.” 

“1 assure you most solemnly, no 
one outside this planet will ever 
know what you do here.” 

“Excuse me, but I doubt that. I 
am not the only hunter to come to 



this planet, and sooner or later a 
trader or a military ship will call. 
Your enemies on this planet cannot 
be entirely silenced, and they will 
not miss the chance to complain 
about the spaceship that, unpro- 
voked, molested them, and it will 
be discovered that the ship was 
mine. I mention these facts first, 
because you may not believe me 
when I tell you that, in any case, 
the Earth authorities will be con- 
cerned if I fail to return from this 
trip on time.” Schoenberg lifted his 
arm casually and briefly glanced at 
his calendar watch. 

Andreas smiled slightly. “No one 
on Earth or any of the other worlds 
knows where you are. Whatever 
search is made for you will not be 
on my planet.” 



S choenberg did not hesitate for 
a moment. So far he had not 
shown the slightest sign of fear. “It 
will be your mistake. High Priest, if 
you do not believe me. But never 
mind that now. Let us return to 
what you want. Say that I am now 
sitting in the command chair in the 
control room of my ship with you 
presumably leaning over me and 
holding a knife against my throat. 
Where to?” 

“Schoenberg, I am not literally 
going to hold a knife against your 
throat. Not in your control room 
anyway, where you might be 
tempted to push something the 
wrong way in an effort to disrupt 
my plans. There is a priest here 
who has been aboard spaceships 
before, and we are not so utterly 
ignorant of them as you might sup- 
pose ... I had thought you might 



100 



IF 




be willing to join in a military sort 
of adventure. De La Torre would 
be, but he is ignorant. I have ques- 
tioned the other people of your 
party, and believe them when they 
say they know nothing about the 
ship’s drive, nor of pilotage.” 
“That is correct. I am the only 
pilot here.” 

“Tell me, for my curiosity, how 
could they have gotten home if a 
glacier-beast had killed you?” 
“Autopilot could handle that. 
Just punch in a destination, and 
it’ll deliver you in-system, near any 
civilized world you want. Your 
priest who’s been aboard space- 
ships must know that. I take it you 
want some other kind of piloting.” 
“Yes. But mainly some detailed 
information about the drive.” 

“Tell me what it’s all about and 
maybe I’ll provide that informa- 
tion.” 

Andreas’s eyes probed at him, 
not fiercely but deeply, for what 
seemed a long time. “Perhaps that 
would be best.” The old priest 
sighed. “Perhaps other ways . 
tell me, what effect do threats of 
torture and maiming have upon 
you?” 

Schoenberg half rose, and leaned 
forward glaring. “High Priest, I am 
a powerful man out there, in the 
big world that holds your little 
world surrounded. Do you think 
that just anyone can possess his 
own starship and take it where he 
likes? I have made it in the interest 
of several other powerful and ruth- 
less people to look out for my safety, 
to avenge my death or disappear- 
ance. And those people do know 
exactly where I am and when I am 
due to return. For every dol of pain 



you make me suffer, you will feel 
two, or perhaps ten, of one kind of 
pain or another. My friends and I 
can pull down your city and your 
Temple if you provoke us to it. Now 
threaten me no more!” 

The two men’s eyes were still 
locked when there came a tap at the 
door and it opened and one of the 
Inner Circle put in his head, 
making a slight nodding signal to 
Andreas. Other business called. 

The High Priest sighed and 
arose. Smiling, skull-faced, he 
bowed his head very slightly in sa- 
lute to Schoenberg. “You are a 
hard man to frighten, outworlder. 
Nevertheless I think it will be 
worthwhile to do so. Think for a 
while on what I have said, and 
shortly we will talk again.” 



uomi was afraid. 

He was not simply afraid of be- 
ing caught by Andreas’s soldiers, 
who yesterday had taken the ship 
and Barbara and had no doubt also 
swept up the four other unsuspect- 
ing outworlders with little diffi- 
culty. No, the night in the thicket 
had given Suomi plenty of time to 
think and there was a lot more to it 
than that. 

Hours ago he had left the thicket 
where yesterday his Ifight had come 
to an exhausted halt. Now he was 
crouched in the poor concealment 
of some thin, bush-like vegetation 
near the road that climbed the 
mountain, watching and waiting — 
for what he was not exactly sure. 
He had vague hopes of spying some 
lone traveler whom he might ap- 
proach in hopes of getting some 
kind of help. 




BERSERKER’S PLANET 



101 




Alternatively he imagined an- 
other pack train of the kind he had 
already seen, passing by, and a con- 
venient bag of vegetables or haunch 
of meat tumbling forgotten to the 
road, where he might spring out a 
minute later to grab it up. He had 
as yet found nothing very palatable 
in the woods and thickets, and so 
he had not eaten anything worth 
mentioning in more than a standard 
day. 

He was also thirsty, despite the 
rainwater he had licked from some 
dripping leaves, and he was limp- 
ing fairly badly from yesterday’s 
fall. His back bothered him, and he 
thought that one of the minor cuts 
on his leg might be infected, de- 
spite the routine immunological 
precautions taken before leaving 
Earth. 

The thicket into which he had 
burrowed himself when he stopped 
running was so dense and extensive 
that it seemed possible that a man 
might stay there undiscovered — un- 
til it pleased his pursuers to detail a 
hundred men dr so to hunt him out. 
But perhaps Suomi had no pur- 
suers. On this alien planet he had 
literally nowhere to go. He sus- 
pected strongly that his continued 
freedom, if it could be called that, 
was due only to the fact that no par- 
ticular effort had been made to 
round him up. He could not believe 
that the warriors of Hunters’ were 
particularly afraid of dying by his 
rifle, so it must be that they were 
not hunting him because more im- 
portant things were going on. 

Realizing that he could not ac- 
complish anything there he had left 
the thicket. There was a warning to 
be spread. At moments it seemed 



possible that the whole thing had 
been no more than a monstrous 
practical joke, like an initiation . 
but then he recalled his dark clear 
thoughts of the night just past, and 
shivered a little in the warmth of 
day. It was not only for himself that 
he feared, and not only for the 
people who had come with him 
from Earth. In his mind’s eye 
Suomi could still see with perfect 
clarity the robot’s shattered cara- 
pace, the debris of components 
spilling out. And there, mixed with 
all the handmade parts . 



£4£Joftly, outworlder,” said a 
gentle voice quite close be- 
hind him. 

He whirled and found he was 
presenting the rifle at a rather short 
man with sandy hair, who was 
standing beside a tree six or eight 
meters off, muscular arms raised 
and hands open in an unmistakable 
gesture of peace. The man wore the 
gray clothing Suomi had seen on 
Godsmountain’s slaves, and tucked 
into the heavy rope that served him 
as a belt was a short massive sledge. 
The killer of fallen gladiators. The 
man stood taller than Suomi re- 
membered and also had a more 
open and attractive face. 

“What do you want?’’ Suomi 
held the rifle steady, though his 
gaze went darting around the 
woods. No one else was in sight; the 
slave had come here alone. 

“Only to talk with you a little.” 
The man’s tone was reassuring. He 
very slowly lowered his hands but 
otherwise did not move. “To make 
common cause with you, if I can, 
against our common enemies.” He 



102 



IF 




nodded in an uphill direction. 

Did slaves on Hunters’ habitually 
talk like this? Suomi doubted it. He 
scarcely remembered hearing them 
talk at all. He did not relax. “How 
did you find me?” 

“I guessed you might be some- 
where near the road by this time, 
thinking about giving up. I have 
been trying to find you for an hour, 
and I doubt anyone else has made 
the effort.” 

Suomi nodded. “I guessed that 
much. Who are you? Not a slave.” 
“You are right, I am not. But 
more of that later. Come, move 
back into the woods, before some- 
one sees us from the road.” 

Now Suomi did relax, lowering 
the rifle with shaking hands and 
following the other back into the 
trees, where they squatted down to 
talk. 

“First, tell me this,” the man de- 
manded at once. “How can we pre- 
vent Andreas and his band of 
thieves from making use of your 
stolen ship?” a 

“I don’t know. Where are my 
companions?” 

“Held in the Temple, under what 
conditions I am not sure. You don’t 
look good. I would offer you food 
and drink, but have none with me 
at the moment. Why do you think 
Andreas wants your ship?” 

“I am afraid.” Suomi shook his 
head. “If it is only Andreas I sup- 
pose he has some simple military 
use in mind to complete his con- 
quest of this planet. He may think 
our ship carries weapons of mass 
destruction. It has none.” 

The man was looking sharply at 
Suomi. “What did you mean, if it is 
only Andreas?” 



44TT ave you heard of the ber- 
JtjLserkers?” 

A blank look. “Of course, the 
death machines of legend. What 
have they to do with this?” 

Suomi began to describe his com- 
bat with the man-shaped machine. 
His hearer was ready to listen. 

“I heard a rumor that Mjollnir 
had walked forth to fight, and was 
slain,” the man in gray mused. 
“So, it was a berserker that you 
destroyed?” 

“Not exactly. Not entirely. 
Against a true berserker android 
this rifle would have been useless. 
But inside the machine’s broken 
body 1 found this.” He drew from 
his pocket a small sealed box of 
shiny metal. From the box a thick 
gray cable emerged, to expand into 
a fan pf innumerable gauze-fine 
fibers at the point where his force 
packet had sheared it off. “This is a 
solid-state electron uclear device, in 
other words part of an artificial 
brain. Judging from its size, and 
the number of fibers in this cable* I 
would say that two or three of 
these, properly interconnected, 
should be enough to control a robot 
that could do physical things better 
than a man can do them, and also 
obey simple orders and make 
simple decisions.” 

The man reached for the box and 
weighed it doubtfully in his hand. 

Suomi went on: “Many solid- 
state electronuclear devices are 
made on Earth and other technolo- 
gical worlds. I have seen countless 
varieties of them. Do you know how 
many I have seen that closely re- 
semble this? Exactly one. I saw that 
in a museum. It was part of a ber- 
serker, captured in a space battle at 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



103 




the Stone Place, long ago.” 

The man scratched his chin, and 
handed back the box. “It is hard 
for me to take a legend as reality.” 

Sumoi felt like grabbing him and 
shaking him. “Berserkers aje very 
real, I promise you. What do you 
suppose destroyed the technology 
of your forefathers, here on 
Hunters’?” 

“We are taught as children that 
our ancestors were too proud and 
strong to let themselves remain de- 
pendent on fancy machines. Oh, 
the legends tell of a war against ber- 
serkers, too.” 

“It is not only legend but his- 
tory.” 

“All right, history. What is your 
point?” 

“That war cut off your ancestors 
from the rest of the galaxy for a 
long time and wrecked their tech- 
nology — as you say, they were 
rough men and women who found 
they could get by without a lot of 
fancy machines. Made a virtue of 
necessity. Anyway, it has been 
taken for granted that Karlsen’s 
victory here destroyed all the ber- 
serkers on Hunters’ or drove them 
away. But perhaps one survived, or 
at least its unliving brain survived 
when the rest of its machinery was 
crippled or destroyed. Perhaps that 
berserker is still here.” 

His auditor was still receptive but 
unimpressed. Suomi decided that 
more explanation was in order. He 
went on: “On other planets there 
have been cults of evil men and 
women who have worshipped ber- 
serkers as gods. I can only guess 
that there might have been some 
such people on Hunters’ five hun- 
dred years ago. After the battle 



they found their crippled god some- 
where, rescued it and hid it. Built a 
secret cult around it, worshipped it 
in secret, generation after genera- 
tion. Praying to Death, working for 
the day when they could destroy all 
life upon this planet.” 

The man ran strong-looking, 
nervous fingers through his sandy 
hair. “But, if you are right, there 
was more to it than the figure of 
Mjollnir? The berserker has not 
been destroyed?” 

“I am sure there is more to it 
than that. The real berserker brain 
must have included many more of 
these small units. And other com- 
ponents as well. Probably it put 
only spare parts into Mjollnir. Or 
human artisans did, working at the 
berserker’s direction.” 

“Then why must there be a true 
berserker, as you put it, here at all? 
Andreas has very good artisans 
working for him. Perhaps they only 
used parts from destroyed ber- 
serkers to build the figure of Mjoll- 
nir — and one of Thorun as well.” 
He nodded to himself. “That would 
explain why men swear they have 
actually seen Thorun walking with 
the High Priest in the Temple 
courtyards.” 

“Excuse me, but it is not possible 
that any human artisans on this 
planet designed the robot that at- 
tacked me. No matter what com- 
ponents they had to work with. Can 
you grasp the programming prob- 
lems involved in designing a ma- 
chine to run and fight and climb 
like a man? Better than a man. No 
human could have climbed that 
mesa where the machine did it, in a 
few minutes, hammering in pitons 
all the way. And the mechanical en- 



104 



IF 




gineering difficulties? No. On 
Earth, Venus, a handful of other 
planets, there are men and facilities 
capable of designing such a robot. 
Only a functioning berserker-brain 
could do it here.” 



T he two men were quiet for a 
little while, both thinking, each 
studying the other. Suomi eased 
himself into a different position, 
sitting with his back against a tree 
trunk. His wounded leg throbbed. 
At last the Hunterian said: “Sup- 
pose a berserker is here as you say, 
and the priests of Godsmountain 
have it. What then?” 

“You do not understand!” Suomi 
almost grabbed him by the ragged 
shirt to attempt a shaking. “Say 
rather that it has them. How can I 
begin to tell you what a berserker 
is?” He sighed and slumped back, 
feeling hopeless and exhausted. 
How to convey, to someone who 
had never seen even depictions on 
film or holograph, the centuries of 
mass destruction berserkers had 
visited upon the galaxy, the docu- 
mented cases of individual horrors? 
Whole planets had been sterilized, 
whole solar systems laid waste by 
the unliving enemy. People by the 
thousands or tens of thousands had 
perished in berserkers’ experiments 
aimed at discovering what made 
the strange two-legged Earth-des- 
cended blobs of protoplasm so re- 
sistant to the fundamental truth-as- 
sumption of the berserkers’ pro- 
gramming: that life was a disease of 
matter that had to be expunged. It 
had all happened here, was still 
happening somewhere a thousand 
light years or more away, on the 



outer edge of man’s little domain 
within the galaxy. 

Suomi said quietly: “If it is true 
that a berserker has captured our 
ship then it can be for only one pur- 
pose; to somehow sterilize this 
planet of all life.” 

“You said there were no mass 
weapons on the ship!” 

“I meant there were none in the 
usual sense. But there is the drive 
that brought us between the stars.” 
Suomi considered. “If the ship 
were buried beneath this mountain, 
say, and the drive suddenly turned 
on full force, the mountain might 
be blown up into the air and every- 
one on it killed. Not good enough 
for a berserker, not if it could find a 
way of doing worse. 

“I’ll bet that if the drive were 
worked on cunningly enough some 
weapon could be made of it that 
could sterilize a planet. Perhaps by 
polluting the atmosphere with 
radioactivity. The weapon wouldn’t 
have to be instantly effective. There 
probably won’t be another inter- 
stellar ship here for fifteen standard 
years. No way for anyone here to 
call for outside help, even if they 
understood what was happening.” 
The man in gray was excited at 
last. He stood up cautiously and 
looked about, then squatted down 
again. He fingered the handle of his 
maul, as if itching to pull it from 
his belt and fight. “By all the 
gods!” he muttered. “It should be 
effective, whether or not it is the 
truth!” 

“Effective? What should be?” 
“It should be effective against 
Godsmountain’s priests, to spread 
the story that the drive of the cap- 
tured ship is to be altered, our air 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



105 




poisoned. That a berserker really 
rules Godsmountain, and means to 
destroy the world. If we can con- 
vince people of that, we will have 
them!” 

“It is the truth, I believe. But to 
spread any story across the planet 
will take far too long.” 

The man with the maul glanced 
up toward the mountaintop, in- 
visible beyond the trees. “I do not 
think we will need to go that far. 
Now. How to put the story in con- 
vincing terms? Let’s see. Five hun- 
dred standard years ago the ber- 
serker fleet was here. The demigod 
Karlsen drove them out. The priests 
for some reason have been asking if 
any of you outworlders mentioned 
Karlsen; that seems to fit. Now — ” 

Now Suomi did actually seize 
him by the shirt, to the Hunterian’s 
great astonishment. “They asked 
that?” Suomi barked. “Of course it 
fits!” 

For half an hour thereafter they 
made their plans. 



X 

T he four remaining contestants 
were awakened early from their 
sleep on the soft groundcover of 
what Thomas the Grabber had 
called the gods’ private park. At 
dawn there erupted a racket of 
small winged creatures, each de- 
fending his bit of territory against 
encroachment by the others. Farley 
of Eikosk, roused by the noise of 
this miniature Tournament, watch- 
ed it for a while, and then, with 
sudden awareness of where he was, 
turned his gaze uphill through the 
park-like forest, toward the summit 



of the mountain. 

There, in the early morning 
light, the white walls had a dull and 
ghostly look. Later, he knew, when 
he saw them in full sunlight, they 
would shine a da-Jing white. All 
his life he had listened eagerly, 
whenever he could, to the tales of 
travelers who had visited this city. 
To see its white stones actually be- 
fore him inspired him with awe. 

Thorun lived there. 

Thorun actually lived there. 

From the moment of Farley’s 
awakening on this morning a sense 
of unreality grew in him rapidly. He 
could not fully credit his own pres- 
ence here on the mountaintop, or 
his success thus far in the Tourna- 
ment. (How pleased his father 
would be, at last, if he should be 
the winner!) This feeling of unrea- 
lity persisted through the morning 
ritual of worship, and through their 
meager breakfast of cold fried 
cakes left over from the day before. 
The dumb slave who served them 
protested with gestures that no 
dead wood was available here to 
make a fire for cooking. 

The other slave had gone off 
somewhere, perhaps on a search for 
wood. Leros still had not returned. 
The priest Yelgir, who still seemed 
a stranger to Farley, looked stiff- 
jointed and disheveled after a night 
spent in the open. He spoke to 
them apologetically about the fact 
that no fighting ring had been pre- 
pared here in advance. 

Yelgir, in consultation with the 
warriors, chose a flat area of 
ground and the slave was set to 
work stripping away the ground- 
cover and stamping flat the earth as 
best he could. The task took the 



106 



IF 




slave several hours, while the others 
sat watching. 

Farley was not exactly impatient, 
but the delay was one more change 
in routine, and made everything all 
the more unreal for him. At last the 
ring was ready, however. Yelgirwas 
muttering prayers and it was time 
for the first two men to fight to take 
their places. 

“Farley of Eikosk — Jud Isaks- 
son.’’ 

Now both of them were in the 
circle from which only one of them 
could ever walk. But as Jud moved 
toward him, more slowly than was 
his wont, it occurred to Farley that 
death itself might well be different 
here, almost under the windows of 
Thorun’s hall. Would the loser of 
this fight really die as men usually 
did, like some butchered animal? 
Might he not instead simply look 
down at his gaping wound, ac- 
knowledge defeat with a salute and 
a courteous nod, and, like one leav- 
ing a field of harmless practice, 
simply walk off yonder through the 
trees, perhaps to be met halfway by 
welcoming Mjollnir or Karlsen or 
even Thorun himself? 

In Farley’s eyes the scimitar 
flashed sunlight. Jud was warming 
up now, starting to come on with 
his usual fury. Farley suddenly felt 
free and loose, faster and stronger 
than ever in his life before. It was as 
if he now breathed in the immor- 
tality of the gods by merely sharing 
their high air. 

He parried the scimitar with a 
seeming carelessness, that was 
really something else, and then he 
stepped in looking for the best way 
to kill. Now Farley carried his long 
sword too high, now too low, now 



he let his blade stray far aside into 
what should have been a weak posi- 
tion, until he could almost hear his 
father shouting at him in anger, 
but none of this was carelessness. 
Not today. Whatever tactic his 
whims, his nerves, chose for him 
was fated to succeed. His blade al- 
ways came back into position in 
time to block the scimitar. On the 
attack his long sword reached 
closer and closer to Jud’s lifeblood. 

To Farley the end seemed foreor- 
dained and only the suddenness 
with which it came surprised him. 
He stood there almost disappointed 
that the fight was over, while Jud 
dying on the ground seemed to be 
trying to tell him something. Jud’s 
life ran out too quickly, before the 
words could come. 

The priest Yelgir cleared his 
throat. “Omir Kelsumba — Thomas 
the Grabber.’’ Today he needed no 
paper to keep track of names. 

Standing to one side, Farley was 
struck by the realization that in this 
round, for the first time, there 
would be no other victors to stand 
at his side watching with him, now 
and then passing a joke or a com- 
ment on the fight in progress. 
Watching alone, except for the 
priest, he beheld a serene happiness 
on Kelsumba’s face; obviously here 
was another who felt favored by the 
gods today. Things appeared to be 
different with Thomas the Grabber. 
Even before the first blow his ex- 
pression was that of a man who 
knows himself defeated. 

In the center of the ring the two 
of them closed promptly. The axe 
flashed out with reckless confidence 
with what must be Kelsumba’s cer- 
tainty of approaching godhood. 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



107 




The spear moved with the speed of 
desperation, and yet as accurately 
and steadily as if wielded by a god. 
Incredibly, the fight was over. 

Or was it over? Kelsumba, even 
with the heavy spear transfixing 
him, fought on. His axe, though it 
was much slower now, still rose and 
fell. Thomas was still unhurt. But 
instead of backing away and wait- 
ing for his man to fall, he chose for 
some reason to leap in and grab. As 
the two men wrestled it was still 
Omir who smiled, and Thomas who 
looked desperate. But it was 
quickly demonstrated that Omir 
was not the stronger of the two, at 
least not with a spear stuck through 
him. Only after Thomas had 
wrenched away the axe and used it 
for a finishing blow did his face lose 
its look of desperation. 

Now the clangor of arms, that 
had long since silenced the winged 
quarreling creatures, was ended 
also. The forest at last was still. 



W hen Schoenberg was brought 
before him again, about mid- 
day, Andreas was seated as before. 
As soon as the two of them were left 
alone, the High Priest began: 
“Since the thought of torture does 
not immediately terrify you, and I 
suspect its application might pro- 
voke you to some rash attempt at 
misinforming us about the ship, I 
have decided I must take an ex- 
treme measure to frighten you suffi- 
ciently. You have brought it on 
yourself.” Andreas was smiling 
again, evidently finding his own wit 
amusing. 

Schoenberg, unimpressed, sat 
down. “How do you mean to terrify 



me, then?” he answered. 

“By saying a few words.” 

“Andreas, my respect for you is 
fading. If the threats you have al- 
ready made have not had their de- 
sired effect neither will any mutter- 
ings about some great unnameable 
terror. You are not going to scare 
me that way. In fact you are not 
going to scare me at all, not in the 
way you seem to want.” 

“I think I can. I think I know 
what a man like you is truly afraid 
of.” 

“What?” 

“Perhaps I can do it by saying to 
you only one word.” Andreas 
clapped his hands together play- 
fully. 

Schoenberg waited. 

“The one word is his name.” 

“Thorun. I know that.” 

“No. Thorun is a toy. My god is 
real.” 

“Well, then. Utter his terrible 
name.” Schoenberg lifted his eye- 
brows in almost jaunty inquiry. 

Andreas whispered the three syl- 
lables. 

It took Schoenberg a little while 
to grasp it. At first he was merely 
puzzled. “Berserker,” he repeated, 
leaning back in his chair, his face a 
blank. 

Andreas waited, confidently, for 
his god had never failed him yet. 

Schoenberg said: “You mean . 
ahhh. 1 think I begin to see. You 
mean one has really been here for 
five hundred years, and you — serve 
it?” 

“I am going shortly to offer to 
the god of Death a special sacrifice, 
consisting of some people we no 
longer need, I can show you. You 
will be convinced.” 



108 



IF 




“Yes, I believe you can show me. 
I believe you. Well. This puts a 
different fate on things, all right, 
but not in the Way you intended. If 
I wouldn’t help you in a local war, 
I’m not going to help you in a mass 
extermination.’’ 

“Schoenberg, when we have done 
with this planet what we will, when 
it is moribund, my god assures me 
that the ship’s drive can be restored 
sufficiently to take it out into space 
again and after a voyage of many 
years to reach another star whose 
planets also are polluted by the foul 
scum of life. I and a few others, 
members of my Inner Circle, will 
make this voyage, continuing to 
bear the burden of hideous life on 
our own bodies that we may free 
many others of it on other worlds. 
There are emergency recycling sys- 
tems on your ship that will nourish 
us adequately for years. 

“The voyage, as I have said, will 
be many years in duration. Unless 
you agree to cooperate with me 
from this moment on you will be 
brought with us as a prisoner. You 
will not die. There are ways of pre- 
venting suicide, my master assures 
me, things he can do to your brain 
when he has time to work on it. 

“You will be useful on the 
voyage, for we will have need of a 
servant. You will not be tortured — 
I mean, not much at any one time. 
I will see to it that your sufferings 
never become sharp enough to set 
one day of your existence apart 
from another. I may die before the 
voyage is over, but some of my asso- 
ciates are young men and they will 
follow my orders faithfully. You 
Earthmen are very long-lived, I 
understand. I suppose you will — 



what did the old Earthmen call 
it? — go mad. No one will ever 
admire your exploits. There will be 
none to admire. But I suppose you 
might continue to exist to an age of 
five hundred years.” 

Schoenberg had not moved. Now 
a muscle twitched in his right 
cheek. His head had bowed a very 
little, his shoulders were a little 
lower than before. 

Andreas said: “I would much 
prefer to see you make a sporting 
finish, myself. Go out with a noble 
gesture. If you cooperate in my 
plans, a different future for you 
might be arranged. You will only 
be helping us to do what we are 
going to do anyway. 

4 If you cooperate, I will give 
you” — Andreas held up a hand, 
thumb and forefinger barely separ- 
ated — “just a little chance, at the 
very end. You will not win, .but you 
will die nobly in the attempt.” 
“What kind of chance?” Schoen- 
berg’s voice was low and desperate 
now. He blinked repeatedly. 

“Give you a sword, let you try to 
hack your way past one of my fight- 
ing men, to get to the berserker and 
cut it into bits. Its cabling would be 
quite vulnerable to such an attack.” 
“You wouldn’t really do that! It 
is your god.” 

Andreas waited calmly. 

“How do I know that you would 
really do' that?” The words burst 
out as if involuntarily. 

“You know now what I will do if 
you do not cooperate.” 

The silence in the little room 
stretched on and on. 

O nly three men, not counting a 
slave or two, now remained on 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



lOfr 




their feet under the pleasant trees 
of the gods’ otherwise deserted 
park, Farley and Thomas stood fac- 
ing each other, their eyes meeting 
like those of two strangers encoun- 
tering each other by chance in a 
wilderness both had thought unin- 
habited. In the background the 
priest was giving orders to the 
slaves; there was the chunk of a 
shovel starting a new grave. 

Farley looked down at what lay 
on the ground. Jud had not smiled 
at his wound and gone off on a 
blithe stroll among the trees. Kel- 
sumba was not laughing on his way 
to an eternal feast with gods. Farley 
did not care to stay and watch them 
rolled into a little pit. Feeling a 
slow emergence from his sensation 
of invulnerability, he turned and 
started on the uphill road once 
more. 

Thomas the Grabber, still wiping 
at his spear, came along silently 
and companionably. They left the 
priest behind. Here the pavement 
of the road was very smooth and 
well maintained, and it was neatly 
bordered with stones in a pattern 
that put Farley in mind of certain 
formal walks on his father’s large 
estate. 

Now, with what seemed to Farley 
stunning ordinariness, they were 
coming through the last trees of the 
forest and around the road’s last 
curve. Vistas opened, and gardens 
and orchards were visible in the dis- 
tance to either side. Ahead, the 
road ran straight across thirty or 
forty meters of well-tended lawn, 
and then it entered the citadel-city 
of the gods. The gate by which it 
entered, of massive timbers banded 
with wrought metal, was tightly 



closed just now. The high wall of 
the city was a blinding white in the 
sun, and Farley was now close 
enough to see how huge and heavy 
its stones were. He wondered how 
they had been stained or painted to 
make them look like bone. 

But nothing happened inside 
him when he beheld their goal, the 
place where Thorun dwelled. Im- 
mortality was draining from him 
rapidly. 

“Thomas,” he said, slowing to a 
halt. “The whole thing is too — 
ordinary.” 

“How’s that?” asked Thomas, 
amiably, stopping at his side. 

Farley paused. How to explain 
his disappointment? He could not 
understand it well himself. He said 
what came to his tongue, which was 
only: “There were sixty-four of us, 
and now there are only two.” 

“But how else could it have 
worked out?” Thomas asked rea- 
sonably. 

A few weeds grew through the 
rocks beside Thorun’s gateway. 
Lumps of the dried dung of some 
pack animal lay at the roadside. 
Farley threw back his head and 
closed his eyes. He groaned. 

“What is it, friend?” 

“Thomas, Thomas. What do you 
see here, what do you feel? Sudden- 
ly I am having doubts.” He looked 
at his companion for help. 

Thomas shook his head. “Oh my 
friend, there is no doubt at all 
about our future. You and I are 
going to fight, and then only one of 
us is going living through that 
gate.” 

There was the gate, tough ordi- 
nary wood, bound with bands of 
wrought metal, its lower parts 



110 



IF 




showing a little superficial wear 
from the brushing passages of 
countless men and women, slaves 
and animals. Behind such a gate 
there could be nothing but more of 
the same world in which Farley now 
stood, in which he had lived all his 
life. And if he reached the gate of 
the Temple inside, would it be any 
different? 

The priest Yelgir, whom they 
had left behind, came on now to 
pass them, giving Farley an uneasy 
smile as he did so. Evidently some 
unseen watcher within the walls 
noted the priest’s approach, for 
now the gate was opened slightly 
from within. Another priest stuck 
out his head and sized up Farley 
and Thomas with an impersonal 
look. “Is either of them wounded?” 
he asked Yelgir. 

“One has a damaged hand, and 
cannot use his dagger, but that 
seems to bother him very little. The 
other a sliced arm. The muscle is 
not cut, nothing serious.” The two 
priests began a low-voiced conver- 
sation that Farley could not quite 
hear. Meanwhile other heads, ob- 
viously aristocratic, began to ap- 
pear along the top of the wall, their 
owners evidently standing on some 
high walkway on the inner side. 
The two finalists of Thorun’s Tour- 
nament were being stared at like 
slaves on auction. Thomas the 
Grabber finished wiping his spear 
and now stood leaning on it, shift- 
ing his weight from one foot to the 
other and sighing. 

“Bid the two contestants wait,” 
someone was calling carelessly from 
inside. “The High Priest sends 
word that he hopes to attend the 
final duel, but he is busy now with 



some special sacrifice to the gods.” 
XI 

S uomi, after his talk with the 
man in gray (whose name he 
had never learned), breathed a sigh 
of relief mingled with exhaustion 
when he had gotten as far as the 
foot of the little mesa without being 
discovered and seized by Andreas’s 
men. Suomi had to somehow man- 
age to get himself into the ship 
again, before he could hope to ac- 
complish anything. He must not be 
captured before he reached the 
mesa. 

According to the gauge on the 
breech of his rifle, it had power left 
for only six shots. He might have 
thrown away the weapon in the 
woods, except for his fear that some 
fool might find it and kill himself or 
someone else by accident. He had 
offered the rifle to the man in gray, 
when they were about to part, but 
the offer was refused. 

“I must continue to pass as a 
slave,’’ the Hunterian had said. 
“No slave could carry such a device 
into the city without immediately 
being questioned. Besides, I am un- 
familiar with its use; better each 
man to his own weapons.” 

“Each to his own,” Suomi had 
answered, reaching out for a fare- 
well handshake. “Good luck with 
yours. I hope I meet you in the city 
above.” 

Now, at the foot of the mesa, he 
observed that a regular trail had 
already been worn, leading from 
the lower end of the climbing path 
off into the woods uphill in the 
direction of the city. He observed 
also that not a trace remained of 



BERSERKER’S PLANET

the shattered robot; at first he 
could not even locate the place 
where it had lain. Then he realized 
that the massive tree, whose surface 
his rifle fire had splintered, had 
been removed. Here was the neatly 
sawn stump, with dirt rubbed on 
the cut surface so it would not look 
fresh. The tree itself had somehow 
been carried away. Great pains 
were being taken to eliminate all 
evidence that anything grotesque 
had happened here. But a number 
of men must have been involved in 
the cleanup and at least one of 
them must have talked, so the man 
in gray had rumors to build on. So 
much the better. 

When he got to the bottom of the 
climbing path, Suomi did shrug out 
of the rifle’s strap and let the 
weapon fall aside. Gratefully he 
saw that the climbing rope was still 
in place. Fighting down a foolish 
impulse to turn at the last moment 
and run away to cower in the woods 
once more, he gritted his teeth and 
gripped the rope and began to 
climb. Weakened and aching, he 
was now compelled to hang on with 
both hands even on the easy first 
part of the slope, where before he 
had been able to climb rapidly on 
legs alone. 

He had gotten only a little way up 
when a soldier came into view, 
looked down and saw Suomi, and 
began shouting. Suomi ignored the 
shouts and continued to struggle 
slowly upward. The shouting kept 
on. Suomi looked up and saw that 
the man had a spear raised as if 
ready to throw. 

“If you stick me with that 
thing,” Suomi yelled back at last, 
“you’ll have to carry me. Look at 



me. Am I so dangerous that I 
frighten you?” 

His belly muscles were tensing 
against the impact of the spear, but 
it did not come. The voice stopped 
shouting, moved away just a little, 
and began to talk. Other male 
voices answered. Suomi did not pay 
much attention to what they were 
saying, and did not look up again. 
Dizzy with hunger and fatigue, 
feverish from his infected wound, 
he struggled on the rocks for what 
seemed an endless time before he 
could pull himself out on the flat 
horizontal surface at the head of 
the path. 

The foam mattress lay almost 
under his feet when he stood up but 
there was no sign of Barbara. Half 
a dozen men, four soldiers and two 
priests in purple-trimmed robes, 
crowded around Suomi, barking 
threats and orders at him, almost 
nudging him off the mesa again 
with their drawn swords and a 
leveled spear. Finally one of the 
aristocrats raised his voice and 
there was order. The soldiers put 
down their weapons, rapidly strip- 
ped Suomi and searched him, then 
searched through his clothes and 
tossed them back to him. 

“What’ve you done with the girl 
who was here?” he asked while this 
was going on. No one bothered to 
answer. 

“Bring him inside the ship,” one 
of the aristocrats ordered the sol- 
diers. 

“We’d better get on the com- 
municator first and ask Andreas,” 
the other one advised. After a mo- 
ment’s debate they compromised 
and had Suomi brought up the 
landing ramp as far as the open en- 



112 



IF 




trance lock. There they left him 
standing for the moment, with two 
soldiers gripping his arms. His 
guards were unusually large, strong 
men, and once the initial confusion 
of his capture was over they obeyed 
orders with precision and alertness. 

Suomi wished he could sit down, 
but was not quite certain that he 
would be able to get up again if he 
did. He could hear voices from the 
direction of the control room en- 
gaged in what sounded like a talk 
on the communicator between the 
ship and somewhere else. Andreas’s 
prize-crew perhaps had more tech- 
nological savvy than Suomi had as- 
sumed. So much the worse. 

In a little while one of the aristo- 
crats came back from the direction 
of the control room to stand in 
front of Suomi and regard him 
critically. “Andreas is busy with 
sacrifice. I think we’ll just bring 
this one on board, and confine him 
to his old stateroom. The place has 
been searched a dozen times, there 
are no weapons. Outworlder, you 
look in a bad way.” 

“If I could have some food ...” 

“We won’t starve you to death, I 
don’t suppose. Though you may 
wish we had.’’ He signed to the sol- 
diers to bring Suomi on into the 
ship. 

At the entrance to the control 
room the aristocrat turned. “Hold 
him tightly going through here.” 

They brought him into the con- 
trol room, and they were quite right 
to make sure that he was held se- 
curely. Otherwise it might have 
been barely possible for him to 
lunge at the drive controls and, be- 
fore he could be stopped, wreck the 
ship. But there was no hope of that, 



his arms were pinned in grips he 
could not have broken on his 
strongest days, of which this was 
not one. 

Seated in the large central pilot’s 
chair was another aristocratic 
priest. 



O n a screen before him were the 
faces of two men who seemed 
to be in some dimly lighted stone 
chamber. The one in the back- 
ground was another priest. The one 
in front was Schoenberg. 

“Now,” the priest in the control 
chair was saying, addressing the 
screen, “You say that if the ship 
pitches more than ten degrees while 
under manual control, the auto- 
pilot will cut in automatically?” 
“Yes,” Schoenberg’s image said 
on the screen. “Provided the artifi- 
cial gravity is off. Then ten degrees 
pitch and you’ll get the autopilot.” 
“Schoenberg!” Suomi cried out. 
“Don’t fly it for them, Schoenberg, 
it’s a berserker they’re working for. 
Don’t do anything they want!” 
Schoenberg’s face showed a re- 
action, though only a trivial one, 
and his eyes moved, probably fol- 
lowing Suomi’s passage through 
the control room on a portable 
screen taken from the ship. The 
men transporting Suomi were mak- 
ing no particular effort tohush him 
up or hurry him along. 

“A berserker, Schoenberg!” 
Schoenberg’s eyes on the screen 
closed. His face looked deathly 
tired. His voice came wearily into 
the ship. “I know what I’m doing, 
Suomi. Just go along with them. 
Don’t make things more difficult 
than they are.” 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



113 




Suomi with his escort passed out 
of the control room and into the 
narrow passage leading to the state- 
rooms, moving at a brisk pace. The 
doors of most of the rooms and 
compartments stood open, reveal- 
ing scenes of disorder, but that of 
the room that had been Barbara’s 
was closed. A bored-looking soldier 
stood leaning against it from the 
outside. 

“Is the girl in there?” Suomi ask- 
ed. Again no one would answer. He 
supposed that at this stage it made 
no difference whether she was or 
not. 

His captors knew somehow which 
room was his — perhaps they had 
found his name on something 
there, perhaps Schoenberg for 
whatever reason was telling them 
every small detail. When they 
thrust Suomi into the room he 
found it in the same state of disrup- 
tion as the others he had seen, 
which was no more than might have 
been expected after several thor- 
ough searches. There was no sign 
that anything had been wantonly 
smashed. So much the better. 

They left him alone and closed 
the door behind him; no doubt 
there would be a soldier leaning 
against it on the outside. Since the 
room had not been designed as a 
prison cell, its door could be locked 
only from the inside. Unfortunately 
it had not been designed as a for- 
tress either; though the door was 
thick and soundproof, it could 
probably be forced open quickly by 
a couple of armed and determined 
men. Nevertheless Suomi quietly 
activated the lock. 

He went then to stand beside his 
bunk, where an intercom control 



was set into the wall, and paused 
with his hand upraised. He could 
try to reach Barbara this way. But 
what could he say? Some of the 
enemy might well be in her room 
listening. To try to reassure her, to 
offer hope, might be much worse 
than useless. He turned the inter- 
com to a position where it would re- 
ceive but not transmit and left it 
there. 

The next thing he did was to get 
himself a long drink of cold water 
from the little sink. Then he 
opened the medicine chest, selected 
an antibiotic and a painkiller. 
There also he found a medicated 
dressing to put on the worst of his 
minor wounds, the leg gash that 
somehow had become infected. 
After that, with a single glance of 
longing at the comfortable bunk, 
he walked to the little desk-work- 
bench where he had kept his 
personal cameras and sound-re- 
cording gear. This material, like 
everything else, had been looked at 
and scattered. He opened drawers, 
looked in corners, searching. All 
was in disarray, but it seemed that 
nothing he needed had been re- 
moved or broken. He uttered a sigh 
of relief that broke off midway as 
he entered a new phase of tension. 

It was time to sit down and get to 
work. 



I n its buried shrine far below the 
Temple the berserker perceived 
the chanting far above of five 
familiar male voices. From the 
same location came the sounds of 
the shuffling of fourteen human 
feet, in a pattern consistent with 
that of one of the processions with 



114 



IF 




which the humans habitually began 
their sacrificial rituals. Routine 
analysis of the sounds allowed the 
berserker to identify among the 
members of the procession not only 
five of its familiar servitors but two 
other human organisms, one male 
and one female, that were strangers 
to it. 

Compulsively but still routinely, 
the berserker concentrated all its 
senses upon the unknown male, 
who was now stumbling slightly on 
bare feet at the top of the long stone 
stair that must be unfamiliar to 
him, as the procession began its 
descent from Thorun’s temple. As 
it would have done with any strange 
male, the berserker was attempting 
an identification with another 
whose personal patterns were car- 
ried under highest priority in its 
data banks. 

Since its crippling and near-de- 
struction in the battle 502.78 . 
standard years ago the berserker’s 
senses had been blurred and uncer- 
tain, hardly better than human 
sight and hearing. But the proces- 
sion was bringing the unknown 
male nearer and nearer now, and 
the probability of his being identi- 
fied with the prime target patterns 
was rapidly declining to a negligible 
level. The berserker was free to 
turn its attention to other matters. 

In the electron uclear mind of the 
berserker there was no wonder and 
no impatience, but there was defi : 
nitely an awareness that some 
events were far more probable than 
others. In that sense therefore the 
berserker was surprised when it 
computed that today two human 
victims were to be offered to it in- 
stead of one, or an animal only, as 



often happened. 

in all the time since the battle in 
which it was damaged, since the 
human goodlife on this planet had 
rescued it from destruction and be* 
gun to offer it worship, the berserk- 
er had received such multiple offer- 
ings on only a few occasions. 
Searching back now through its 
memory banks and comparing 
data, it noted that these had in- 
variably been times of intense emo- 
tion among its devotees. 

One such occasion had been the 
celebration of final victory over a 
particularly stubborn enemy tribe, 
a victory attained by following a 
battle plan computed by the ber- 
serker for its worshippers and 
handed down by it as a divine com- 
mand. Then seventy- four human 
organisms, all members of the de- 
feated tribe, had been sacrificed to 
it in one day. At another time of 
multiple sacrifice the emotions of 
those offering it had been much dif- 
ferent. Then they were pleading for 
help, during a period of great food 
shortage. From that famine the 
berserker had led its followers and 
their tribe into a land ripe for 
plunder, by outlining for them a 
migration route, using its old 
battle-maps of the planet’s surface. 
And now it computed that the suc- 
cessful capture of the starship, and 
the impending completion of the 
long effort to find a way to sterilize 
the planet, must also produce 
intense emotion among this genera- 
tion of its goodlife servants. 

The berserker did not under- 
stand emotion, and only when com- 
pelled by circumstances would it try 
to work with what it did not under- 
stand. The stimulus-response pat- 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



115 




terns called fear and lust, for 
example, seemed at first to be 
readily computable in humans as 
well as in less dangerously intelli- 
gent animals. But in more than five 
hundred years of attempting to 
master human psychology well 
enough to use these patterns to 
manipulate human organisms, the 
berserker had time and again run 
into depths and complexities of be- 
havior that it could not understand. 
To accept worship meant trying to 
use patterns that were, if anything, 
even deeper and more complex, a 
tremendously uncertain means of 
working toward its goal. But no 
better means had been available, 
and with the capture of the starship 
it seemed that this was after all go- 
ing to prove successful. 

Now the procession had complet- 
ed its descent of the stair, and now 
it was entering the berserker’s 
chamber. The High Priest Andreas 
entered first, his vestments for this 
occasion of red and black, Thorun’s 
white and purple having been put 
secretly aside above, in Thorun’s 
temple. The robes in which the 
High Priest now appeared to wor- 
ship his true god were heavily and 
ineradiCably stained with the rust- 
brown of old blood. 



B ehind Andreas came Gus De 
La Torre and Celeste Servetus, 
their wrists bound behind them, 
garbed in white and garlanded with 
live flowers that would soon be 
scattered on the floor to die. Four 
priests of the Inner Circle followed, 
their robes for this special occasion 
red and black like the High Priest’s, 
and stained like his as well. 



Andreas and the other four men 
conducting the sacrifice began per- 
forming the usual prostrations and 
chanting the usual litanies, while 
the victims, as usual, watched in 
uncertainty and mounting fear. 
The berserker had long ago noted 
that the words and actions used in 
these rituals tended to change but 
little over the standard centuries, 
the long Hunterian years, only 
gradually becoming somewhat more 
elaborate. For the moment it kept 
quiet. It had realized long ago that 
the less it said during a sacrificial 
ceremony, the better. Not only did 
it thus lessen the risk of confusing 
and disillusioning its worshippers 
by saying something out of tune 
with their incomprehensible psy- 
chology, but the rarer its pro- 
nouncements were, the more im- 
portance humans were wont to 
grant them. 

Two of the priests had now 
picked up instruments of music, 
and the rhythm of a drum and the 
wail of a horn now blended with the 
chanting. The music ordered and 
modified the beat of alpha brain 
waves, and the rhythms of other 
biological processes, in all the 
humans present. 

“Gus, help me! Help! Oh, God, 
no no nooo!’’ So screamed the fe- 
male upon at last fully perceiving 
the stained altar just before her, 
and evidently realizing its purpose, 
just at the moment when the two 
priests who were not playing instru- 
ments came to tear away her gar- 
lands and clothes and chain her 
down upon the stones. The ber- 
serker watched steadily to see 
whether Gus or God (whatever en- 
tities these might be) might come to 



116 



IF 




the female’s aid, although from its 
experience following 17,261 similar 
appeals the probability seemed 
vanishingly small. 

The female was secured to the 
altar and no help for her arrived. 
Her screams continued as Andreas 
took up a sharp implement and re- 
moved from her living body the 
organs most closely connected with 
the reproduction of life and the 
nourishment of the very young. 
These he threw before the ber- 
serker, demonstrating a symbolic 
and real triumph of Death over the 
very wellsprings of life. The ventral 
surface of her torso was then 
opened more deeply, and the cen- 
tral blood-pump of her body was 
excised, whereupon the female al- 
most instantly ceased to function. 

It was now time for the second 
victim to be placed upon the altar. 

“No. Listen, my friends, I’m 
with you. No, no, not me. How can 
this be happening? Wait, let’s talk, 
you’re making a mistake. I’ll join 
you.” And then a wordless, hope- 
less cry, as his feet were tripped out 
from under him and he was thrown 
down naked upon the stones. 

Why should the male organism 
continue to struggle so violently 
when it must perceive that the 
chances of such struggle producing 
favorable results were now astro- 
nomically remote? Now at last the 
male had been chained down. 

“I’ll help you! I’ll do anything 
you want. Oh. Ah. No. Forgive me, 
everyone ...” Another scream, as 
his organs of generation too were 
removed, and cast into the bloody 
puddle of female parts. And now 
his ventral tissues parted under the 
sharp knife in the High Priest’s 



hands, and now his heart, still pul- 
sating, was held up in offering to 
the god of Death. 

“It is well, it is pleasing,” the 
berserker told the five gory, happy 
men who now stood quietly before 
it. Drum and horn and voice had 
ceased. The chamber was still. The 
five who still bore the burden of life 
were subsiding now into states of 
emotional relaxation. 

“I am pleased,” the berserker re- 
iterated. “Go now and prepare to 
bring the starship to me, that we 
may begin to attach my circuitry to 
its control systems. Only when that 
is done can we begin the alteration 
of its drive.” 

“Today or tomorrow, oh Death, 
we will bring you the starship,” 
said Andreas. “As soon as we are 
sure that Lachaise can fly it safely 
we will lower it into the pit. To- 
morrow also we will bring you fresh 
human sacrifice.” 

“That will be good.” Meanwhile 
a possible problem had suggested 
itself to the berserker. “Are many 
of your people mystified by or 
curious about the ship? Is there any 
unrest because of its presence?” 

‘ “There is some curiosity about it, 
oh Death, but I will handle that. 
This afternoon there will be a dis- 
traction that will leave the people 
able to think or talk of nothing else. 
Thorun is going to walk forth into 
the city and display his powers.” 

The berserker tried to compute 
the probable results of such an 
event, and found it could not 
grapple with the numerous abstract 
factors successfully. “In the past 
you have always ,been cautious 
about putting Thorun on display.” 

“Lord Death, the masses will not 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



117 




accept as divine any creature that 
they can see daily in the streets. But 
Thorun’s future will now be short 
in any case. At the most, a thir- 
tieth-of-an-old-man’s-lifetime, and 
the masses of this world will no 
longer need a god — or any god save 
Thou.” 

The berserker decided to trust its 
goodlife servant in this matter. So 
far he had never failed his god. “So 
be it, loyal Andreas. Proceed in the 
service of Death as you think best.” 

Andreas bowed low, and then the 
humans began their rituals of de- 
parture, which included cleaning 
up the mess th^y had made. 

The berserker computed routine- 
ly that two deaths had been achiev- 
ed today, which was a good, if 
modest, accomplishment. But, as 
always the waste of time and energy 
involved in formal sacrifice had 
been considerable, and that was 
not good. 

Never had the berserker asked 
for offerings of pain and terror. 
Killing, simple killing without end 
as long as life existed, was all it 
wanted. It was not enthusiastic 
about inflicting pain, which was 
after all a manifestation of life ancf 
therefore, after all, evil. 

It allowed the torture to go on 
only because the infliction of pain 
was so satisfying to the humans 
who were its servitors.

T he two finalists of Thorun’s 
Tournament were still being 
kept waiting outside the city gate. 

“Thomas, why are we being 
treated so? Disregarded. Forced to 



wait here, like tradesmen or musi- 
cians or actors, without honor. Are 
we not now nearly gods? Is this just 
some final form of trial?” 

“My foolish, highborn friend.” 
Thomas’s voice was sympathetic, 
the rest of his answer long in com- 
ing. “You really think that there 
are gods in there?” 

“I — ” Farley had not been able 
to sit down for restlessness, and 
now he swayed on his feet in agony 
of mind. “Thorun help me! I do not 
know.’’ His admission of doubt 
hung in the air while time stretched 
on and on, an endless-seeming time 
for Farley in which, as far as he 
could tell, Thorun did nothing at 
all. 

“You in there!” Farley bellowed 
suddenly, toward the priests who 
still looked down upon them from 
the wall. Startled eyes swung round 
to focus on him. The priest Yelgir 
had gone in some time ago, saying 
he would soon be back. 

“What?’’ one answered, awk- 
wardly. 

“Are we companions of the gods 
or not? What kind of welcome is 
this you have prepared for us? 
Leros shall hear of this, and the 
High Priest himself!” 

He paused then, as suddenly as if 
he had run into a wall, his flaring 
anger burned out as fast as it had 
arisen. “Thomas,” he whispered. 
“Did you hear my words just now? 
Not ‘Thorun will hear of this’ but 
‘the High Priest will hear’. I know 
now what I believe.” Again his look 
changed, to anger once more, but 
this time quiet and bitter. “Why 
then am I here?” 

His loud outburst had had 
enough effect on the priests that 



118 



IF 




one of them was now beginning a 
speech placatory if not apologetic. 
But Farley would not hear it. Still 
speaking to Thomas, he demand- 
ed: “Tell me, what will happen if 
you and l choose not to fight? If we 
simply turn our backs on them, and 
go about our own affairs?” 

Thomas was aghast and scowl- 
ing, shaking his head in silent dis- 
approval. Farley could bear no 
more. With deliberate scorn he 
turned his back on all of them and 
started to walk away. Thomas at 
once glanced toward the priests and 
saw their wishes in their eyes. Far- 
ley had not gone more than ten 
paces before Thomas came to block 
his way. Not for the first time, it 
struck Farley as marvelous that 
such a bulky man could move so 
lightly. 

“Thomas, walk away with me, in 
peace.” 

The man holding the spear level- 
ed shook his head. “That cannot 
be.” 

“Come. If you still lust for more 
fighting, I have no doubt that we 
will find it on our way. These soft 
men who play at being gods will 
send their soldiers after us and we 
are not likely to reach the bottom of 
the mountain alive. But we will die 
in true battle, as men should, and 
not for the amusement of liars. 
Come.” 

Thomas was still not angry, but 
very grim. “Farley, I mean to re- 
main alive, and to prove to these 
men that I am the mightiest warrior 
in the land. If I do not conquer you, 
that will not be proven fully. Come. 
Let us fight.” 

The spear had been leveled for 
some time, and now Farley saw the 



little movement at Thomas’s shoul- 
der that meant a thrust was com- 
ing. Farley drew his own weapon 
even as he leaped back from the 
spear thrust. Farley fought. There 
was no choice. When he struck with 
his sword his arm felt as strong as 
ever, but something was lacking 
now — from his backbone or from 
his soul. 

He was not conscious of being 
afraid. It was only that he wanted 
nothing but to leave this place of 
fraud. His feet tried to move him 
toward the downhill road when they 
should have been driving him for- 
ward for the kill. And suddenly his 
belly was being torn open by the 
spear. 

Farley knew that he was lying on 
his face in the soft groundcover. 
Not bad, bis father said, reaching 
down a hand to help him up, but 
you must practice more. Oh father, 
I tried so hard. Then it seemed to 
Farley that he was walking carefree 
through the gods’ green park, but 
the white walls were behind him, 
not in front, and he was going 
home. 



T homas, when he had made sure 
that the last loser of the Tour- 
nament was quite dead, bent over 
to once more wipe his spear. He 
cleaned it on Farley’s costly cloak; 
the cloth had been ruined anyhow, 
by the days and nights in the open, 
and the many battles. 

When the weapon was as clean as 
he could get it under the circum- 
stances Thomas attached the carry- 
ing cord to the spear again and 
slung it over his shoulder. The 
same few faces were still watching 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



119 




him from the gate and the top of 
the wall. They showed mild ap- 
proval, like idlers Rooking on at 
some casual brawl. None of them 
said anything. 

“Well,” Thomas announced, 
feeling somewhat irritated, “you 
have seen it. I am your man. Six 
duels against the very best in the 
world, and I have only one trifling 
scratch while they are all dead.” 

“Andreas will be displeased at 
missing the final duel,” said one. 
Another called down to Thomas: 
“Be patient for a little while. The 
High Priest is coming soon, we ex- 
pect. Come inside the gate if you 
wish.” 

Thomas decided to bring Farley 
into the city with him, as a trophy, 
a symbol of all his victories. He 
squatted and with a grunt picked 
up the warm, loose body at his feet. 
Farley was heavier than the appear- 
ance of his rangy frame suggested, 
and Thomas’s steps toward the city 
gate were slow and weighty. The 
gate swung open for him after he 
had stood before it for a moment in 
fast-mounting impatience. 

His first view of the city inside 
was a disappointment. The gate 
gave directly onto a small paved 
square, only about twenty meters 
on a side. The square was com- 
pletely boxed in by buildings and 
walls that were but little lower than 
the outer city wall through which he 
had just passed. There were several 
gates in the inner walls, but all were 
closed, or showed nothing but more 
walls beyond, so there was not 
much of interest to be seen in any 
direction. A few more people, of 
high and low degree, were looking 
down at Thomas from walls and 



windows. Seeing no place in par- 
ticular to go, Thomas bent and 
with some care set his slow-dripping 
burden down. 

A small fountain gurgled nearby 
and he went to get a drink of water, 
seeing that no one was rushing to 
offer him fermented milk or wine. 
The people on the walls had ceased 
to stare at him now, and were gone 
about their business. Others ap- 
peared from time to time to glance 
and turn away. Here and there 
slaves went about their errands. A 
train of pack animals entered the 
city through the outer gate which 
had remained open, and came 
brushing past Thomas at close 
quarters. 

The man on the wall who had in- 
vited him in had gone. Thomas 
looked about, but there was no one 
for him to berate for his shabby 
treatment. Was he expected to go 
prowling the city at random, 
grabbing strangers by the arm and 
asking directions? Where is Tho- 
run’s great hall? He is expecting 
me. 

They had said the High Priest 
was coming. Seating himself on the 
edge of the fountain, Thomas re- 
tired into dignity, and remained 
there quietly as the shadows shifted 
across the square with the slow pro- 
gress of the sun. Once there in- 
truded upon his thoughts a soft 
snuffling, lapping sound. A small 
hungry domestic animal had dis- 
covered Farley’s otherwise forgotten 
corpse. Thomas moved fast, took 
two strides and launched the beast 
halfway across the square with a 
rib-cracking kick. Then he burn- 
ed to the fountain and sat passively 
waiting.

IF 




When at last he heard someone 
approaching him and looked up 
ready to speak his anger, he found 
that it was only Leros, with whom 
he had no quarrel. Leros looked 
sick, or at least noticeably older 
than he had a fe^ days ago. 

Standing before him with hands 
outspread, Leros said: “I am sorry, 
Thomas, Lord Thomas. They say 
Andreas is coming now, but I do 
not know what welcome he plans to 
give you. If I were High Priest 
things would be different. Let me 
congratulate you on your victory.” 
Thomas got up to his full height. 
‘‘Where is the High Priest An- 
dreas?” he called out, looking 
around at the anonymous faces on 
walls and in windows. Suddenly 
their number was growing again, 
more people peering out into the 
square at every moment. Something 
impended. Spectators were gather- 
ing. ‘‘Where is he, I am growing 
impatient with this treatment.” 
‘‘Speak more respectfully,” a 
tall, regal-looking man admonished 
him sharply from his place of se- 
curity on a high inner wall. 

Thomas looked this one over and 
decided to continue to be bold; it 
was an attitude that usually got re- 
sults, for him. “Respectfully? I am 
a god now, am I not? Or a demi- 
god at least. And you do not look 
like anything more than a man.” 
“The point is well taken,” said 
Leros sternly to the man on the 
wall. That one looked angry, but 
before he could say anything a mur- 
mur swept around the square and 
everyone’s attention again shifted. 
The smallest and most intricately 
decorated of the inner gates that 
gave on the square was being 



opened from the far side by a young 
priest. Footsteps crunched on the 
neat gravel walk revealed beyond 
this gate, and there emerged from 
it a tall, skull-faced man dressed 
more in purple than in white. From 
the reactions of those around him, 
Thomas realized that this must be 
Andreas. 

“You must be Thomas the 
Grabber,” the High Priest said, 
nodding to him affably, speaking in 
the confident voice of one who is 
habitually in charge of things. “I 
see you have finished the Tourna- 
ment somewhat ahead of schedule. 
I am sorry to have massed it all — 
the final round especially. But no 
matter, Thorun is pleased.” An- 
dreas nodded, smiling his smile. 
“So pleased is he that he has decid- 
ed to grant you special honor, even 
beyond that promised you below.” 

This was more like it. Thomas 
made a little bow toward the High 
Priest, then stood taller than be- 
fore. 

The smile was a baring of teeth 
in the skull mouth. “You are to 
fight the fight that all true warriors 
must dream about. I hope that you 
are ready. But of course, as a true 
warrior, you must be.” 

“I am ready,” Thomas growled, 
meanwhile cursing himself mentally 
for being fooled by the first soft 
words. “But I am done with fight- 
ing, as far as Thorun’s Tournament 
is concerned. I am the winner.” All 
around him he heard a catching of 
breaths. Evidently one did not talk 
like that to the master of the world, 
the High Priest of Thorun. But 
Thomas would not simply bow his 
head and be only another man, not 
now. He must take and hold the 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



121 




place that he had rightfully earned. 

Andreas, glaring at him, put 
steel into his voice. “You are to 
fight against Thorun himself. Do 
you mean that you would prefer to 
enter his hall with your blood still 
safe inside your veins, with all your 
joints still hung together? I cannot 
believe it.” 

The murmuring voices rose up 
wildly now, in rumor and specula- 
tion. What did the High Priest 
mean? Could Thorun actually be 
coming, to duel against a mortal 
man? 

It made no sense to Thomas, and 
he did not like it in the least. Still, 
looking at the clever and experienc- 
ed Andreas, very much in control, 
he decided that boldness had its 
limits. He bowed once more to the 
High Priest, and said: “Sir, a word 
witlv you alone, if I may.” 

“No more words, for you or from 
you,” said Andreas softly. He turn- 
ed his head slightly in a listening 
gesture, and smiled again. 

Beyond the gateway through 
which Andreas had come the gravel 
crunched again, in the rhythm of a 
single long-striding pair of feet. In- 
credibly heavy the tread must be, to 
make the gravel sound like that. 
Above the low wall in that direction 
the top of a head came into view, a 
mat of wild dark hair, while the feet 
must be moving at ground level 
three meters lower. No man was 
that tall. With an unfamiliar weak- 
ness in his knees Thomas believed 
for a moment that his own cynicism 
had undone him after all. The 
naive pious ones had been right all 
along. The dead of the Tourna- 
ment, dismembered and buried 
and burnt along the way, would 



shortly walk before him, laughing 
as they followed — 

The figure now appearing in the 
gateway before Thomas, bemling to 
pass through. 

Thorun. 



XIII 

H is head of wild dark hair was 
bound up by a golden band. 
His fur cloak, vast as it was, barely 
covered his mountainous shoulders. 
His marvelous sword, nearly as 
long as Thomas’s spear, was 
girdled to his waist. All as the 
legends had it. His face, though . 

Thorun did not seem to be look- 
ing at anything. He stared over An- 
dreas’s head, and over Thomas’s, 
and through the still-open outer 
gate (where the limping maul-slave 
stood and gaped &s if he thought 
those eyes were fixed on him) and 
brooded with his terrible unblink- 
ing eyes upon the world outside. 
Once he had come to a halt Thorun 
did not move, did not shift his posi- 
tion or stir a finger, any more than 
would a statue. 

Andreas said nothing more, or, if 
he did so, Thomas did not hear. 
Rather the High Priest bowed him- 
self out of the way, silently and 
obsequiously, though with some 
amusement still visible, out of the 
way of the mighty figure of the god. 

The eyes had moved now, though 
the head had not, and Thorun was 
looking at Thomas. The eyes had 
literally some kind of glow inside 
them, like those of an animal seen 
at nighttime by reflected light. This 
glow was red and orange. Glancing 
quickly around, Thomas saw that 



122 



IF 




the eyes were on him alone, for no 
one any longer stood near him. 
Against one wall of the square he 
saw Leros prostrate in deep rever- 
ence, as were a number of others on 
walls and ground. 

Scores of men were watching 
now, men in white robes and gray 
rags. Those who had been in the 
middle of the square were scram- 
bling away, reaching for high 
perches, getting themselves atop 
things and behind things, getting 
out of the way. Awe was in every 
face. Almost. Only Farley would 
not interrupt his contemplation of 
the sky. 

Thorun now came stepping for- 
ward. Though his movements were 
limber and seemed natural enough, 
even graceful, for some reason the 
impression of watching a statue 
persisted. Perhaps it was the face, 
which was utterly inhuman, though 
the form of each individual feature 
was correct. Neither was the face 
godlike — unless gods were less than 
men, unless they were not, in fact, 
alive. 

But Thorun’s strides were very 
long and purposeful. Thomas, see- 
ing the long sword coming endlessly 
out of its scabbard as the god ap- 
proached, got himself into motion 
just in time. The man launched 
himself backward out of the arc of 
the sword, and it made a soft and 
mournful sighing as it passed in a 
stroke that would have cut a man in 
half as readily as a weed. The war 
god’s bearded lips opened at last 
and bellowed forth a deafening 
battle-cry. It was a strange and ter- 
rible sound, as inhuman as the 
glowing, unblinking eyes and the 
dead face. 



Getting his spear unlimbered 
just in time, Thomas mechanically 
held it out to parry Thorun’s next 
stroke. When the god’s sword 
struck he felt a numbing jolt up 
both his arms, and his armored 
spear was nearly torn out of his 
grasp. It was like some nightmare 
of being a child again, and facing a 
grown warrior in combat. The 
watchers cheered. Whoever or 
whatever Thorun was, his strength 
was well beyond that of any man. 

Thorun advanced methodically, 
unhurriedly. Backing and circling, 
Thomas knew that he must now 
plan and fight the finest battle of 
his life. 



T homas began to fight his finest 
battle but before long was 
forced to realize that it was hope- 
less. His own most violent attacks 
were knocked aside with effortless 
ease, while Thorun’s sword strokes 
came with such murderous power 
and precision that he knew he 
could not parry or avoid them for 
long. Already the battering of 
sword on spear had made his arms 
grow numb and weary. He was 
gripping his spear in both hands 
like a quarterstaff and retreating 
steadily, meanwhile trying to dis- 
cover some workable strategy, to 
spy out some weakness in the de- 
fense of his monstrous opponent. 
Whether that opponent was god or 
man or something else entirely was 
a question that did not bother 
Thomas in the least just now. 

At last, with a good deceptive 
move followed by a superb thrust, 
Thomas got his spear-point home 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



123 




into Thorun’s tunic of heavy fur, 
only to feel it rebound from some 
hard layer of armor underneath. A 
moment of sudden hope burned out 
as quickly as it had come. Around 
him the watchers gasped in aston- 
ishment at his seeming success, 
then relaxed with a collective sigh 
as the world, that had tilted for a 
moment, settled back. Thorun was 
unconquerable. 

Thomas, however, retained a 
spark of hope. If he could hit home 
once with the spear, then he might 
be able to hit home again. If the 
fur-clad chest and belly were invul- 
nerable, where should he try to 
strike? 

How about the face? No. He 
could stand a little farther off— and 
it would be less nearly suicidal — if 
he tried instead for the legs. Tho- 
mas observed that the joints of 
Thorun’s exposed and seemingly 
unarmored knees were not covered 
with unbroken skin like that on 
human legs, but instead showed 
fine and smoothly shifting cracks, 
as if they were the legs of a well- 
made puppet. The opening in the 
knee-joint presented a very small 
and moving target, but no more 
difficult a one than the insects on 
the wing Thomas had sometimes 
hit in practice. 

No better plan having suggested 
itself, Thomas feinted high, low, 
high again, and then put all his 
power and skill into a low thrust. 
His eyes and arms did not fail him. 
The sharp point of the spear found 
the small opening just as it was 
narrowing slightly with the straight- 
ening of Thorun’s leg. 

There came a grinding vibration 
down the spear’s shaft, and an 



audible snap of metal. Thorun 
lurched but did not fall. With the 
suddenness of the slamming of a 
door, a silence fell over the arena. 
The tip of Thomas’s spearhead 
came away bright, where its point 
had been broken off. 

The silence that had fallen when 
Thorun nearly lost his footing still 
held; Thorun’s knee was now 
frozen in a half-bent position. The 
ruler of the world was wounded, 
and nothing could be heard but the 
scraping dragging of his crippled 
foot as he continued to advance. He 
advanced more slowly than before 
but as implacably as ever. Thomas, 
in retreat again, glimpsed Andreas 
standing atop a wall. The High 
Priest’s face was dark as a thunder- 
cloud, and one of his hands was 
half extended like a claw, as if he 
wanted to interfere now but did not 
dare. 

The limping god came in range 
again of his human opponent. 
Once more Thorun’s great sword 
became a gleaming blur of speed, 
hammering on with untiring vio- 
lence, driving Thomas back and 
back, around and around the little 
space. Thomas, meaning to strike 
again at the wounded knee, feinted 
high and low and high again, and 
then was nearly killed, was knocked 
off his feet, by the impact of the 
sword against his spear. Thorun 
was not to be fooled twice by the 
same tactic. 

Thomas rolled over desperately. 
Thorun, lurching with grotesque 
speed, was almost upon him. Tho- 
mas got his feet under him ftfid got 
away barely in time. Leap to and 
grab, Thomas? Never, against this 
foe. As well leap in and wrestle an 



124 



IF 




ice-born glacier-beast— or one of 
the glaciers themselves. 

Somehow Thomas had managed 
to retain his spear, arid he was still 
blocking the sword with its steel- 
armofed shaft, but he could no 
longer gather energy to launch a 
thrust. Still the sword drove him 
back and back, and around and 
around. Now the watching white- 
robes had once more found their 
voices. 

The end could not be held off any 
longer, Thomas thought. Weary 
and off balance, he raised his arms 
in desperation to catch yet another 
swordsweep against his indestruc- 
tible spear. Again the impact 
knocked him from his feet. The 
world seemed to turn slowly, slowly 
around him as he spun in the air 
and fell, giving him time to wonder 
whether there was a real Thorun to 
be confronted after he had been 
slain by this limping imposter. 

Thomas came down hard and for 
a moment could not move. He had 
lost his grip on his spear at last. 
The weapon lay only a hands- 
breadth from his fingers in the dust 
of the square, but grasping it again 
was one of the hardest greatest 
achievements of Thomas’s life. 



T he killing machine paused in its 
limping progress, as if uncer- 
tain whether the fight was already 
won. Then with its crablike motion 
it came forward once again. Tho- 
mas got himself up on one knee, his 
spear leveled. Another sudden ces- 
sation of noise made him aware of 
how the watchers had been yelling 
for his death. Thorun’s glowing but 
lifeless eyes were judging him. 



What was the wargod waiting for? 
Thomas struggled back to his feet, 
knowing that the next swordstroke, 
or the one after that, would surely 
be the last. Then with the edge of 
his vision he saw a gray-clad figure 
approaching him from one side. It 
moved with a limp, as if in sacri- 
ligious mockery of wounded Tho- 
run’s gait. The slave’s leaden maul 
was lifting casually to dash out 
Thomas’s brains. 

Thomas had been ready to meet 
death, but by all the gods, this was 
too much! He was not yet down and 
helpless! He turned, meaning to 
spear the slave through, while Tho- 
run, lackwit, continued to hesitate. 

Muscles ready for a killing lunge, 
Thomas for the first time looked 
closely into the slave’s face, and 
was momentarily paralyzed by what 
he saw. And gray-clad Giles the 
Treacherous stepped sideways with 
smooth unlimping speed, and with 
all his warrior’s strength let fly with 
the massive maul against Thorun’s 
already damaged knee. 

Metal cracked. The bright arc of 
Thorun’s next swordstroke, already 
underway, went tilting awkwardly 
and curved well wide of Giles and 
Thomas both. Metallic snapping 
sounds prolonged themselves. Slow- 
ly, but without dignity, the monster 
sat down, its left knee bent at a 
wrong angle. It came to rest in a 
sitting position with its torso bolt 
upright, staring at its enemies with 
a face that had not changed, but 
had suddenly become absurd. 

“Thomas!” cried Giles. He leap- 
ed back just in time from the next 
stroke that Thorun, still sitting, 
aimed at him. “Get him between 
us, Thomas. Finish him!” 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



125 




For the first time uttering a war- 
cry of his own, a hoarse and word- 
less yell, Thomas moved quickly to 
accomplish the encirclement. His 
peripheral vision told him that no 
one in the watching throng was 
moving to interfere. They were in 
pandemonium, their white robes 
swirling with disordered motion 
and their voices straining in excited 
noise. There was Leros, standing 
with arms folded in apparent calm, 
barely out of the way of the fight 
and watching it in utter concen- 
tration. Thomas glimpsed Andreas 
standing on a wall. The High Priest 
was waving his arms and seemed to 
be shouting orders, but the insane 
excitement was now such that no 
man’s voice could be heard. 

Even crippled as he was Thorun 
came near to being a match for his 
opposition. Neither spear nor maul 
could beat down the huge sword in 
his untiring arm, and he turned his 
seated body with marvelous speed 
to face first one foreman and then 
the other. 

Catching the eye of Giles, Tho- 
mas roared: “Together! Now!” and 
they rushed at Thorun from oppo- 
site sides simultaneously. The 
sword came at Thomas, and he 
managed to parry it yet again only 
because Thorun, in his sitting posi- 
tion, could not get his whole body 
behind a swing. Even so Thomas 
thought for a moment that his own 
forearm had been broken in the 
clash. But meanwhile Giles had got 
in close, swinging like a piledriver, 
and landed his maul full force on 
the back of Thorun’s neck. 

The blow would have exploded 
the head of any mortal man. Tho- 
run’s wild hair flew, his great head 



jerked, his torso swayed a little, his 
swordarm hesitated. Now Thomas’s 
blunted spearpoint smashed into 
his right eye, which went out like a 
candle, with a tiny crunch that 
came through the spear like break- 
ing glass. Now the maul came down 
again, this time on the swordhand. 
Thorun did not drop his sword, but 
now it stood out at a different angle 
from his fist. 

The giant died slowly, piecemeal, 
indifferent rather than brave, 
emitting neither cries nor blood. 
There was only a step-by-step loss 
of function under the terrible pun- 
ishment of spear and hammer, a 
progressive revelation of Thorun’s 
vincibility, a bit-by-bit reduction of 
his body to little more than shatter- 
ed metal and glass and fur. 

Even when the huge body was 
hopelessly beaten, when the god’s 
battered face had been humiliating- 
ly pounded down into the earth be- 
side the fountain, the sword arm 
was still trying to fight, lashing out 
with murderous, random blows. A 
spear thrust loosened its fingers 
and the giant sword feH from the 
hand with a dull little sound. The 
arm, its broken digits clutching 
spasmodically on emptiness, was 
still waving when Thomas and 
Giles looked at each other, rested 
their weapons, and then turned to- 
gether to salute the watchers who 
ringed them in. 

The noise of the crowd died away 
into an exhausted silence, a silence 
that seemed to Thomas to go on for 
a very long time. Andreas was no 
longer to be seen, he noted, and a 
few others had also vanished. Most 
were still watching, as if hypnotiz- 
ed, the helpless, stubborn move- 



126 



IF 




ments of Thorun’s arm. Thomas- 
went to kick the huge sword out of 
its reach. 

Eyes began now to turn toward 
Leros, who was the senior priest 
still in attendance. Obviously in the 
grip of powerful emotions, he took 
two steps forward and stretched 
forth an arm toward the fallen 
giant; but Leros was still too 
overcome to speak, and the first 
of his outstretched arm clenched 
tightly his arm dropped back to his 
side. 

I t was left to Giles to break the 
silence at last. Gesturing at the 
wrecked giant, he shouted out: 
“This creature is not your beloved 
Thorun. It cannot be! Andreas and 
his Inner Circle have deceived you 
all!” 

The roar that went up from the 
crowd in response had much of 
agreement in it. But one voice cried 
out at Giles: M Who are you, that 
have interfered and done this? 
Agent of the Brothegigod! Spy!” 
Giles raised a hand and got si- 
lence in which to make his answer. 
“Very well, say I am a spy, an 
agent, anything you like. But what 
I have shown you here is nothing 
but the truth. Call me what you 
will. But will you call me a god, to 
defeat another god in combat? And 
what god could I be, to conquer 
Thorun?” He raised his face to the 
bright sky, and made a holy sign. 
“Great Thorun, avenge yourself 
upon the blasphemers who have 
put forth this deception!” And he 
gestured again to where ruined 
Thorun still moved one arm in a 
parody of battle. 

Several men with their daggers 



drawn — there were no larger wea- 
pons in evidence among the 
crowd — came to surround Giles. 
They took away his maul and stood 
guard over him, but at a word from 
Leros did no more. Giles made no 
protest or resistance, but stood 
proudly with his arms folded. 
Leros, after gazing a little while 
longer in continued shock at what 
remained of Thorun, summoned 
two or three other leaders who were 
present to withdraw with him to a 
corner of the square. There they at 
once plunged into earnest talk. 
Most of the other spectators, mar- 
veling and arguing, began to crowd 
around the fallen figure that had 
been their god. 

Giles the Treacherous, looking at 
Thomas, suddenly flashed him a 
smile of surprising brightness for a 
man in his doubtful situation. 
“Lord Thomas,” Giles hailed him, 
“it seems that you are now th$ 
champion of gods as well as men.” 

“Well. You don’t claim a share 
of the prize, whatever it may prove 
to be?” Thomas moved closer to 
Giles, with whom he felt a kinship. 

“I? Never. You have won the 
championship fairly and I have no 
claim to make.” 

Thomas nodded, satisfied on this 
point. But he had other worries. 
Standing next to Giles, he looked 
around him restlessly. He had the 
feeling that as champion of the 
Tournament, and acknowledged 
victor over the imitation Thorun, 
he should be doing something, as- 
serting authority somehow. Prob- 
ably he should go to join the talk 
around Leros and make the priests 
listen to him. But what would he 
tell them? He realized now that he 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



127 




had not the faintest idea of what 
was really going on. He was more 
likely to find out, he thought, if he 
stayed with Giles, who might well 
need some help in return soon and 
be willing to bargain. Anyway, 
Thomas felt much more at home 
talking with another fighting man 
than he did with the priests. 

“Why are you here, and how?” 
he asked the shorter man. “It is in 
my memory that I saw you die.” 

Giles’s smile had faded to a mere 
twist of the lip. “You saw Jud 
thrust at me, and me go plunging 
down a hillside.” 

“You were not even wounded?” 

“I was not. You see, I had per- 
suaded Jud that all I wanted was a 
chance to get out of the Tourna- 
ment and away. He was something 
of a cynic, and so believed me. Also 
he was glad of the chance to take an 
uncontested victory, and went along 
with the plan I had hatched. He 
had only to hold back his thrusts a 
little, as I did. 

“His sword only took a few 
threads from, my jacket before I 
went over the edge. I had marked 
beforehand that the slave carrying 
the maul was of my size and color- 
ing, which suggested the whole 
plan to me. When the slave came 
down to make sure I was dead I was 
waiting in the bushes and did the 
office for him instead. I took his 
rags and his rope belt and his maul, 
and put them on together with his 
limp, before dragging him uphill to 
be buried in my good clothes. The 
rest of you had started on ahead by 
then, as I had expected. 

“I was seldom in your camp after 
that. My companion slave was 
dumb, and so lackwit he did not 



notice the transformation — or per- 
haps he was shrewd enough to ig- 
nore intrigue when he became 
aware of it. None of the rest of you 
ever looked at me with open eyes, 
once I had put on gray rags — not 
until you looked at me just now, 
when you thought I was coming for 
you with the maul.” 

Thomas shook his head in won- 
derment. “A fearful risk you took.” 

“Not so great a risk as having to 
face you, or Kelsumba perhaps, or 
Farley, in open combat. I had 
made up my mind that that risk 
was too high.” 

“But still, a strange game,’’ 
Thomas commented. “Why did 
you play it? Why — ?” He gestured 
toward the wreckage that had been 
Thorun. 

“I wanted to expose that thing 
for what it was. Rather, for what it 
is, since we have so far destroyed 
only a small part of it.” Giles look- 
ed around him. His audience, that 
had been only Thomas and a 
couple of dagger-guards when he 
started speaking, was now far 
larger. He raised his voice and went 
on: “We all know now that this 
thing was never Thorun. It was only 
a creation of something else. Some- 
thing else whose harboring on 
Hunters’ planet would bring scorn 
and derision from the whole out- 
world if it were known to them.” 

“What is this shameful thing you 
speak of?” The question came from 
Leros, who had ended his confer- 
ence with the other ranking priests 
and had now been listening to Giles 
for some little time. 

“1 am speaking of one of our an- 
cestors’ ancient enemies, a ber- 
serker,” said Giles, and briefly out- 



128 



IF 




lined his conversation with Suomi 
in the woods. “If Andreas has not 
yet silenced the .outworlders he is 
holding in the Temple, they will be 
able to confirm that he has stolen 
their ship from them. Perhaps they 
will be able to tell us why.” 

“Why should be believe the out- 
worlders over the High Priest?” 
someone called, challenging. 

Giles raised his voice again. 
“The outworlders did not bring this 
imitation Thorun with them. An- 
dreas and his Inner Circle priests 
have used it for years, to dupe Tho- 
run’s faithful followers. No artisan 
on Hunters’ could have made it 
alone, any more than he could 
build a spaceship. Nor can it be the 
true persona of a god, or not even 
Thomas the Grabber could have 
knocked it down. What else can it 
be then, but a berserker, or part of 
one? If it is not a berserker, per- 
haps the High Priest and his Inner 
Circle can explain just what it is. I 
would ask them now if they were 
here. But they fled when they saw 
that their fancy machine was 
doomed.” 

Leros nodded grimly. “It is time, 
and past time, for us to ask An- 
dreas some hard questions.” The 
roar of agreement that went up was 
short, for men wanted to hear what 
Leros was going to say next. He 
went on: “I think, though, that it is 
not for you to tell us what to ask. 
Whose agent are you, treacherous 
one?” 



G iles shrugged, and admitted 
readily: “I was sent here by 
what you call the Brotherhood. But 
what of that, honest Leros? Today I 



have told you and shown you noth- 
ing but demonstrable truth. I see 
now that we of the Brotherhood 
really have no quarrel with the 
people of Godsmountain, but only 
with the Inner Circle and its head.” 

Leros grunted, perhaps a bit be- 
wildered by the ready flow of 
words, half convinced by them and 
half put off by their smoothness. 
Before he had to reply, however, he 
was distracted by the return of a 
man who had evidently been dis- 
patched to see what was going on at 
the Temple. This messenger 
brought back word that the doors 
and gates leading to the Temple 
complex had been locked and 
barred from within, and the palace 
guard of soldiers directly under the 
command of the High Priest were 
occupying the place. Andreas 
would not appear, but only sent out 
word that all spies, traitors, and 
their dupes would soon tremble 
before his wrath. 

“He will not answer reasonable 
questions?” Leros demanded. “He 
will not explain why he dared to 
foist this . this thing . upon 
us as a god?” 

“No, Lord Leros, he will not.” 

“Then it is certain,” Leros shout- 
ed, “Andreas no longer speaks in 
Thorun’s name! Great Thorun, 
stand with us now! Stand with us as 
we prepare to prove in combat who 
can serve you best!” 

There was a new outbreak of 
shouts and prayers, a general up- 
roar of activity as men rushed to 
arm themselves, debated hasty 
plans of organization, and argued 
over whether any of the military 
commanders known to be nearly in 
the field should be summoned with 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



129 




their troops and asked or ordered 
to drive Andreas from the Temple. 
This last suggestion was shouted 
down. Thomas gathered that the 
soldiers now in the Temple were too 
small a force to hold it for long 
against the aroused citizenry. Well, 
let the strategists debate; he would 
know what to do when it came to 
fighting. 

Finding himself for the moment 
more or less alone again with Giles, 
Thomas said to him: “I thank you 
for stepping in against the monster; 
I will not forget it.” Thomas was 
beginning to appreciate how 
shrewd Giles was, and to under- 
stand that he himself was going to 
need shrewd advice to secure a 
position of power among these 
people. 

“You are welcome, Lord Tho- 
mas, for whatever my help was 
worth.” 

“Why did the Brotherhood send 
you here?” 

Giles made a little self-deprecat- 
ing motion with his head. “I was 
the best fighter they could find. I 
was sent to the Tournament from a 
district largely under their control. 
They hoped of course that I could 
win the Tournament, and then 
function against Godsmountain 
from some place of authority inside 
it. But long before the Tournament 
was over I realized that I was not 
going to win. You and some of the 
other fighters were obviously better 
than I. So I hatched the scheme us- 
ing Jud Isaksson . but tell me. 
Lord Thomas, why are you here?” 

“I?” Thomas was surprised. 

“Yes. I don’t think you ever be- 
lieved there was a real Thorun here, 
to reward you with immortality. I 



have told you my real reason for 
taking part in the Tournament; 
what was yours?” 

“Huh. Well, fighting is my busi- 
ness. It was dangerous, yes, as any 
real fighting is, but I expected to 
win. I have never met the man who 
could stand against me in single 
combat.” 

Giles was quietly fascinated. 
“Did you never stop to think that 
each of us could truthfully have 
made that identical claim? Each of 
the original sixty-four?” 

Thomas blinked. “No,’ he said 
slowly. “No, I did not stop to think 
of that.” Suddenly he remembered 
the utter astonishment on the 
beardless dying face of young 
Bram. Was that in the second 
round or the third? He could not 
remember, but it seemed very long 
ago. 

He raised a hand over his shoul- 
der to caress the heavy spear slung 
on his back. He would have to get a 
new one made. Not only was the 
point of this one broken but the 
shaft was dented and weakened, its 
steel reinforcing strips twisted and 
loosened by the battering of Tho- 
run’s sword. “I wanted a place of 
power, wanted to be one of the men 
who rule the world from this moun- 
taintop.” 

Giles prompted: “You thought 
they held the Tournament because 
they wanted the best fighter in the 
world up here, to be Godsmoun- 
tain’s champion. And as such you 
would have great power and 
wealth.” 

“Yes. That’s about it.” 

“An intelligent guess, I would 
say. I, too, believed the Tourna- 
ment had some such purpose. 



130 



IF 




though there were some points I 
could not understand . anyway, 
it seems that we were wrong. 
Andreas and his Inner Circle de- 
ceived everyone in one way or an- 
other. The simple warriors with a 
simple story of gods, and us by 
letting us think that we were wise 
and understood the truth.” 
Thomas swore a great oath, 
throwing in all the gods he could re- 
member on short notice. “Then 
why did they have the Tourna- 
ment? Andreas and his gang did 
not watch us to applaud our skill or 
dwell upon our sufferings. Nobody 
was allowed to watch, except for a 
few priests and the outworlders. 
Why, why preach and urge us on to 
slaughter one another?” 

“They wanted senseless slaugh- 
ter,” said Giles, “because they 
really do not worship Thorun, who 
has life and honor in him, and a 
purpose besides destruction. They 
could never get the mass of people 
to worship their true god, who is 
nothing but Death. Thorun enjoys 
women and wine, tall tales and 
food. Especially he honors the cour- 
age that makes all other virtues 
possible. But death is what they 
worship, and death is what ber- 
serkers represent, death without 
honor or purpose, death alone.” 
Giles fell silent, squinting at the 
wreckage of Thorun on the ground 
where it lay face down in the mud 
near the fountain, not far from Far- 
ley’s sky-gazing corpse. Then Giles 
added: “No, that is not good 
enough. You are right, why did An- 
dreas and the others not watch the 
Tournament, enjoy the killing — or 
let others watch it. Only the out- 
worlders were allowed to come . 



and while they watched, their ship 
was stolen. Is that it? The finest 
heroes of our planet fought and 
died only to lure them here.” 

A shout was being raised by 
many voices, not only in the square 
but all around the city. The out- 
worlders’ ship was in the air. 



XIV 

T he liftoff when it came was very 
smooth, and took Suomi com- 
pletely by surprise; he had dozed 
off at his desk, his head resting on 
his arms, and on first waking had 
had the hideous feeling that the 
ship was already settling down, its 
flight completed, and that his only 
chance to act had come and gone. 

Hastily he turned to look at the 
monitor screen on the bulkhead be- 
side the stateroom’s intercom con- 
trol and saw with relief that the 
flight was certainly not over. 
Imaged in the screen now was 
Orion's control room. The high- 
ranking priest called Lachaise was 
seated in the central pilot’s chair, 
bent forward over controls and in- 
struments in an attitude of rigid 
concentration. Around Lachaise 
other priests and soldiers sat or 
stood in nervous postures, clinging 
to whatever solid supports they 
could get hold of. Looking past the 
far side of the control room, Suomi 
could see down the passageway to 
the entrance lock, at the far side of 
which the main exterior hatch was 
still standing open; moving the ship 
in such a configuration was perfect- 
ly feasible, provided of course that 
no high speed or high altitude was 
attained. Another soldier clung just 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



131 




inside the entrance lock, looking 
out and down through the open 
outer doors. Presumably he was 
posted there as insurance should 
the screens in the control room 
somehow fail, or (what was much 
more likely) should the novice pilot 
have trouble in interpreting their 
images. 

The flight was evidently going to 
be a short one. The berserker must 
be somewhere nearby, and its loyal 
human servants were going to bring 
the captured starship to it. Then 
they would be able to get to work in 
earnest on the ship. Directing an 
operation on itself, the berserker 
could be wired into the onboard 
computers, assimilate them into its 
brain, and take over the ship’s 
various systems as extensions of its 
own being. And then the drive . 
its conversion to a death machine 
could be performed at Godsmoun- 
tain if convenient, or the berserker 
could fly itself and a loyal coterie to 
some safe spot in the uninhabited 
north and there prepare to kill the 
world. 

Through his stateroom screen 
Suomi could monitor much of what 
was showing on the big screens in 
the control room. He had not dozed 
long, for it was still bright day out- 
side. He watched, on the screens, 
the wooded slopes of Godsmoun- 
tain falling away very gently, then 
tilting a bit. At the same time 
Suomi felt Orion tilt in the hands of 
her inexpert pilot as he started her 
moving sideways toward the sum- 
mit. They would not be bothering 
with the artificial gravity on this 
low, slow flight in atmosphere. 

The voices of the people in the 
control room, and those who were 



communicating with them from 
outside the ship, were audible in 
Suomi’s stateroom, coming in over 
intercom. “Schoenberg,” Lachaise 
was saying tensely now, “I have a 
yellow light showing on the life- 
systems panel. Can you explain it?” 

“Let me see,” said Schoenberg’s 
voice, wearily, speaking offstage 
from Suomi’s viewpoint. After a 
little pause, presumably while a 
screen was switched to give him a 
better view, Schoenberg continued: 
“That’s nothing to worry about. 
Just a reminder that the main hatch 
is open and the safety interlocks 
have been disconnected to let you 
fly her that way. It’s just a reminder 
so you don’t forget and go shooting 
up into space.” Whatever pressure 
had been brought to bear, Schoen- 
berg was evidently cooperating fair- 
ly thoroughly. 

The ship was directly over the 
city now, drifting balloon-like on 
silent engines only a few meters 
above the tallest rooftops. “Go 
higher, Lachaise!” another man’s 
voice barked, authoritatively, and 
Suomi saw the high-ranking priest 
in white and purple swivel nervous- 
ly in the pilot’s chair, his pale 
hands in jerky motion, over-cor- 
recting. The ship lurched upward 
while the men around Lachaise 
clung to their chairs and stanchions 
and eyed him apprehensively. The 
upward acceleration ceased, the 
ship hung for a heart-stopping mo- 
ment in free fall, and then with a 
few more up-and-down oscillations 
was brought back under more or 
less steady control. 

“I should have been allowed 
more time to practice!” the pilot 
protested feverishly. 



132 



IF 




“There is no time,” the authori- 
tative voice snapped back. Suomi 
recognized it now a & that of An- 
dreas, speaking from outside the 
ship. “Thorup failed and Leros and 
some agent of the Brotherhood 
have inflamed the mob. We will 
load our dear lord and master onto 
the ship and take him to safety in 
the north with our prisoners. All 
will yet be well, Lachaise, if you can 
only maneuver carefully. Come 
over the Temple now.” 

Lachaise was now guiding him- 
self by a screen that showed what 
was directly below the ship. Suomi, 
in effect looking over Lachaise’s 
shoulder, saw a strange sight the 
significance of which he could not 
grasp at first. Near the largest 
building in the center of the city — 
this must be the Temple, for the 
ship was now hovering almost 
directly above it — another much 
lower structure was having its roof 
peeled back, dismantled, from in- 
side. The workmen doing the job 
were partly visible, their hands and 
arms coming and going, removing 
pieces of roof from the edge of the 
rapidly enlarging opening. Inside 
there was the tracery of thin scaf- 
folding on which the workmen evi- 
dently stood, and besides that noth- 
ing but darkness, unconquerable 
by the sun that everywhere else fell 
bright on street and wall. It took 
Suomi a few moments to realize 
that the building’s interior looked 
dark because it was a single vast 
pit, dug far below the level of the 
city’s streets. 

“Tell them to hurry with the 
roof,” Lachaise pleaded. 

“Are you in position yet?” the 
voice of Andreas countered, the 



strain in it now quite audible. “I do 
not think you are quite in the 
proper position.” 



S uomi could see now that small 
but tumultuous groups of white- 
robed men were running about in 
the streets around the Temple com- 
plex, deploying as if to encircle it. 
Here and there a drawn sword 
waved. And uniformed soLdiers 
moved about on the Temple’s 
walls. Now Suomi saw the bright 
streak of an arrow flying from 
street to wall and two more darting 
in the opposite direction in reply. 
Perhaps the man in gray, with his 
grandiose scheme of entering the 
city disguised as a slave and touch- 
ing off a rebellion, had been more 
successful than Suomi had thought 
possible. 

As for Suomi himself, he had 
done all he could at the workbench 
and now it was time to prepare for 
combat. Feeling unreal, he picked 
up- the small battery-powered unit 
he had assembled and went quickly 
across the small room and got into 
his bunk. Reaching up an arm, he 
turned his intercom to SPEAK. 
The voices of the others still came 
in; and, though they still could not 
see him, he could join in their con- 
versation now. But he was not 
ready. 

The bunk was capable of being 
converted into an acceleration 
couch, meant to be used in case of 
failure of artificial gravity some- 
where in deep space. To fully con- 
vert the bunk now would not be 
feasible, but Suomi swung the 
center section of restraining pads 
over himself as he lay down, and 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



133 




locked it into place. He lay there 
holding his little recorder ready to 
play, the gain turned to maximum. 
He lay rigid with tension and fear, 
almost unable to breathe, not yet 
knowing for certain whether he 
would be brave enough to do what 
must be done. That it might kill 
him was not so bad. That it might 
accomplish nothing except to earn 
him a leisurely and hideous pun- 
ishment from a victorious An- 
dreas — that was very possible, and 
a chance just about too hideous to 
take. 

Suomi, by turning his head, 
could still observe his stateroom 
screen. Lachaise was edging the 
ship over the great pit now, unmis- 
takably meaning to lower it inside. 
The removal of the roof out to the 
eaves had been completed. The fra- 
gile scaffolding left inside would 
part like spiderweb beneath Orion 's 
armored weight. It was all very well 
planned and organized. Andreas 
and the others must have been pre- 
paring for a long time to capture a 
starship. Who had told them how 
to plan their pit, how big it must be 
to hold the kind of ship men would 
be likely to use on a surreptitious 
hunting expedition? Of course, 
their lord and beloved master, 
Death . Death knew all the sizes 
and shapes of human starships, he 
had fought against them for a thou- 
sand years. 

Lachaise in his pilot’s chair was 
now carrying on a continuous ex- 
change of tense comments with the 
men waiting and guiding him be- 
low, and with the lookout at the 
open hatch. The ship began to 
lower. Down, and down — but- this 
proved to be a false start, and La- 



chaise had to straighten her out 
and bring her up again, dribbling a 
thin trail of white dust from where 
the hard hull had brushed deli- 
cately against a high Temple cor- 
nice and knocked down a barrowful 
or two of masonry. 

Up they went, and sideways an 
almost imperceptible distance, and 
started down again. Lachaise was 
probably a natural technician and 
machine operator; at any rate he 
was learning very fast. This time 
the slow descent was true. 

His finger on the switch that 
would turn on the recorder, Suomi 
balanced over infinite depths of 
personal change, chasms of sudden 
death or slow defeat and some- 
where a small plateau of triumph. 
With a part of his mind he won- 
dered if this was the sensation that 
Schoenberg and other hunters 
sought, and the men who faced one 
another in the Tournament, when a 
lifetime’s awareness of being seem- 
ed to pulse through every second of 
experience. 

He could accept all the possibili- 
ties. He could do what must be 
done. The ship was going down into 
the hole. Timing, now, tactics. At 
the bottom they might very well cut 
off the drive, so that would be too 
long to wait. Right now, just enter- 
ing the top of the hole, they were 
still more outside than in, right now 
would be too soon. 

He waited through an eternity; 
the ship must now be a quarter of 
the way down. 

Hallway down. Eternity was 
passing. 

Now. With a relief almost un- 
bearable with surcease of mental 
strain, Suomi touched the switch 



134 



IF 




on the small box he was holding. 

T he voice of Johann Karlsen, bit- 
ing and unforgettable, heavily 
amplified, boomed out through 
Orion s intercom system, through 
the radio links from the control 
room to the outside, through the 
open main hatch, reverberating at 
a volume that must have carried 
into all the nearby city: ‘THIS IS 
THE HIGH COMMANDER 
SPEAKING. LANDING PARTIES 
READY. UNCOVER THE BER- 
SERKER . .” 

There was more, but it was 
drowned out by another voice, a 
voice that could only be the ber- 
serker’s own, booming and bellow- 
ing from some hidden place: 
“FULL DRIVE. ANDREAS, IN 
THE NAME OF GLORIOUS 
DEATH, FULL DRIVE AT ONCE 
KILL JOHANN KARLSEN, HE IS 
PROBABLY ABOARD. I COM- 
MAND YOU, LACHAISE, FULL 
DRIVE AT ONCE. KILL JO- 
HANN KARLSEN, KIL— ’’ 

And then that voice too was 
buried, drowned out, obliterated by 
the explosive violence resulting 
from the full-power application of a 
starship’s drive, not only deep 
within a planet’s gravitational well 
but almost literally buried within 
Godsmountain’s mass. Suomi, 
heavily protected by his padded 
bunk and bracing himself as well as 
he was able, was still shaken as if 
by the jaws of a glacier-beast, flat- 
tened against the bulkhead next to 
his bunk, then forced away from it 
again, only saved by his straps from 
being smeared against the state- 
room’s opposite bulkhead. The 
room’s regular lights went out, and 



simultaneously an emergency light 
glared into life above the door. 

There followed a sudden cessa- 
tion of acceleration, a silence and a 
falling that went on and on. Then 
the fall ended with another bone- 
jarring crash, loud and violent but 
still far closer to the humanly 
endurable on the scale of physical 
events than was that first detona- 
tion drive. 

The ship seemed to bounce, 
crashed again, teetered and rock- 
ed, and came at last to a shudder- 
ing rest, her decks tilted at some- 
where near forty degrees from the 
horizontal. Now all was quiet. The 
screen in Suomi’s stateroom was ef- 
fectively dead, its surface only flick- 
ering here and there with electronic 
noise. 

Suomi unstrapped himself from 
his bunk and climbed the crazy 
slope of the deck to reach the door. 
He had failed to pick up loose ob- 
jects before entering combat and 
breakage in the stateroom had been 
heavy, though there were no indi- 
cations of basic structural damage. 
The strength of the hull had prob- 
ably saved the ship from that. 

The stateroom door opened 
forcefully when he unlatched it, 
and the dead or unconscious body 
of a soldier slid in, trailing broken- 
looking legs. Suomi stuck his head 
out into the passage and looked 
and listened. All was quiet and 
nothing moved in the glare of the 
emergency lights. Here too deck 
and bulkheads and overhead were 
still in place. 

He turned back to the fallen sen- 
try and decided that the man was 
probably dead. Guilt or triumph 
might come later, he supposed. 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



135 




Right now Suomi only considered 
whether to arm himself with the 
man’s sword, which was still resting 
peacefully in its scabbard.- In the 
end Suomi left it there. A sword in 
his hand was not going to do any 
good for anybody, least of all him- 
self. 

He thumped on the door of Bar- 
bara Hurtado’s stateroom and 
when a weak voice answered he 
opened the door and climbed in. 
Amid a kaleidoscopic jumble of 
multicolored clothes from a spilled 
closet she sat in a heap on the floor, 
wearing an incongruous fluffy robe, 
her brown hair in wild disarray, 
leaning against a chair that must be 
fastened to the deck. 

“I think my collarbone is 
broken,” she said faintly. “Maybe 
it isn’t, though. I can move my 
arm.” 

“I’m the one who did it,” he 
said. “Sorry. There was no way I 
could give you any warning.” 

“You?” She raised her eyebrows. 
“All right. Did you do as much 
damage to those sons of beasts out 
there?” 

“More, I hope. That was the 
idea. Shall we go out and see? Can 
you walk?” 

“Love to go and see their broken 
bodies, but I don’t think I can. 
They’ve got me chained to my 
bunk, which I guess is why I wasn’t 
killed. The things they were making 
me do. Always wondered wfiat sol- 
diers were like and I finally found 
out.’’ 

“I’m going out to look around.” 

“Don’t leave me, Carlos.” 

“I’ll be back as soon as I can.” 

Things in the control room were 
very bad, or very good, depending 



on your point of view. It was closer 
to the drive than the staterooms 
were, Suomi supposed. Lachaise, 
strapped into the central, padded 
chair, was leaning back with eyes 
open and arms outflung, showing 
no wounds but very plainly dead all 
the same. Intense localized neutron 
flux at the moment when the drive’s 
fields collapsed was one possibility 
in such disasters, Suomi remem- 
bered reading somewhere. Lachaise 
had perished happily, no doubt, in 
blind obedience to his god, perhaps 
believing or hoping that he really 
was killing Johann Karlsen. In the 
name of glorious death . yes. 

Around Lachaise, the priests and 
soldiers who had been helping and 
watching him had not been 
strapped into padded chairs. Neu- 
trons or not, they now looked like 
so many bad losers in the Tourna- 
ment. This many lives at least had 
the berserker harvested today. 
Some of them still breathed, but 
none were at all dangerous any 
more. 

The main hatch was still open, 
Suomi discovered, looking down at 
it from the control room, but it was 
completely choked with broken 
white masonry and massive splint- 
ered timbers; part of the Temple or 
of somebody’s house perhaps. The 
ship had come to rest within the 
city, then. Probably a number of 
people had been killed outside the 
ship as well as in it, but Godsmoun- 
tain had not been leveled, a lot of 
its people were doubtless still alive, 
and whoever was left in charge 
should come digging his way into 
the ship eventually, probably want- 
ing to take vengeance for the de- 
struction. 



136 



IF 




With some difficulty Suomi made 
his way back to Barbara’s state- 
room and managed to lodge himself 
in a sitting position by her side. 
“Exit’s blocked. Looks like we wait 
together.’’ He described the car- 
nage briefly. 

“Be a good boy, Carlos, get me a 
pain pill from my medicine chest, 
and a drink.’’ 

He jumped up. “Of course. I 
didn’t think — sorry. Water?’’ 

“First. Then one of the other 
kind, if everything in my bar isn’t 
smashed.’’ 



T hey were still sitting there to- 
gether, about half a standard 
hour later, when after much noise 
of digging and scraping from the 
direction of the entrance hatch, 
Leros and a troop of armed men, 
swords in hand and in full battle 
gear, appeared in the stateroom’s 
open door. Suomi, who had been 
listenfng fatalistically to their ap- 
proach, looked up at Leros and 
then closed his eyes, unable to 
watch the sword’s descent. 

Nothing descended on him. He 
heard nothing but a faint multiple 
clinking and jangling, and opened 
his eyes to see Leros and his 
followers facing him on their knees, 
genuflecting awkwardly on the tilt- 
ed deck. Among them, looking 
scarcely less awed than the rest, 
was the man in gray, armed now 
with sword instead of hammer. 

“Oh Lord Demigod Johann Karl- 
sen,’’ said Leros with deep rever- 
ence, “you who are no robot, but a 
living man, and more, forgive us 
for not recognizing you when you 
walked among us! And accept our 



eternal gratitude for again con- 
founding our ancient enemies. You 
have smashed the death-machine 
within its secret lair, and most of 
those who served it also. Be pleased 
to know that I myself have cut out 
the heart of the arch-traitor An- 
dreas.’’ 

It was Barbara who — perhaps — 
saved him then. “The Lord Karlsen 
has been injured, stunned,’’ she 
said. “Help us.’’ 

F ive days later, the demigod 
Johann Karlsen, he who had 
been Carlos Suomi, and Athena 
Poulson, both of them in fine 
health, sat at a small table in a 
corner of what had been the 
Temple courtyard. Shaded from 
the midday Hunterian sun by the 
angle of a ruined wall, they were 
watching the slave-powered rubble 
clearing operations making steady 
progress in the middle distance. 
There the ship still lay, fifty or sixty 
meters from the Temple complex, 
surrounded by a jumble of smashed 
buildings, where it had come to rest 
after the drive destroyed itself. 

Besides the cultists killed inside 
the ship or executed by Leros later, 
at least a score of people, most of 
them people who had never even 
known of the berserker’s existence, 
had died in the cataclysm. But still 
Suomi slept well, for millions of 
innocent folk across the planet 
lived and breathed. 

“So, Oscar has explained it all to 
me, finally,’’ Athena announced. 
“They promised him a chance, a 
fighting chance, to get at the ber- 
serker and destroy it if he cooper- 
ated.’’ 

“He believed that?’’ 



BERSERKER’S PLANET

“He says he knows it was a 
terribly small chance, but there 
wasn’t any better one. They 
wouldn’t let him get on the ship at 
all. He just had to sit in* a cell and 
answer questions for Andreas and 
Lachaise. And the berserker too, it 
talked to him directly somehow.’’ 

4 1 see.’’ Suomi sipped at his 
golden goblet of fermented milk. 
Maybe the stuff made Schoenberg 
sick, but he had found that his 
stomach could handle it without 
difficulty, and he had grown to like 
the taste. 

Athena was looking at him al- 
most dreamily across the little 
table. “1 haven’t really had a 
chance to* tell you what I think, 
Carlos,’’ she said now in a soft, low 
voice. “It was such a simple idea. 
Oh, of course I mean simple in the 
sense of something classical, ele- 
gant. And brilliant.’’ 

“Hm?” 

“The way you used your record- 
ings of Karlsen’s voice, and won the 
battle.’’ 

“Oh, well. That was simple, to 
splice together recorded words to 
make some phrases that a berserker 
ought to find appropriately threat- 
ening. The main thing was that the 
berserker should identify his voice 
and so take the strongest, most vio- 
lent action if could to kill him, for- 
getting everything else, be perfectly 
willing to destroy itself in the pro- 
cess.” 

“But to conceive of it was bril- 
liant, and to do it required cour- 
age.” 

“Well. When I heard that its ser- 
vants were asking about Karlsen, 
for no apparent reason, the idea 
struck me that we might be dealing 



with one of those assassin ma- 
chines, a berserker that had been 
programmed specifically to go after 
Karlsen. Even if it was only an 
ordinary berserker — ha, what am I 
SAYING? — Karlsen’s destruction 
would rate as a very high priority in 
its programming, probably higher 
than depopulating a minor world. I 
gambled that it would just forget its 
other plans and wreck the ship, 
that it would just take it as prob- 
able that Karlsen was somehow 
hiding on Orion with a secret land- 
ing party.” 

“That sounds insane.’’ Then, 
flustered, Athena tried to modify 
the implied criticism. “I mean — ” 
“It does sound insane. But, as I 
understand it, predicting human 
behavior has never been the ber- 
serkers’ strong point. Maybe it 
thought Andreas had betrayed it 
after all.” 

T he god Thorun incarnate, who 
had been Thomas the Grabber, 
strolled majestically into the court- 
yard at its other end, trailed by 
priests and a sculptor who was 
making sketches for a new spear- 
carrying statue. Suomi rose slightly 
from his chair and made a little 
bow in Thorun’s direction. Thorun 
answered with a smile and a cour- 
teous nod. 

Carlos and Thomas understood 
each other surprisingly well. The 
people had to be reassured, society 
supported, through a time of crisis. 
Did Leros and the other devout 
leaders really believe that a god and 
a demigod now walked among 
them? Apparently they did, at least 
in one compartment of their minds, 
and at least as long as such belief 



138 



IF 




suited their needs. And perhaps in 
one sense it was the truth that 
Karlsen still walked here. 

Perhaps, also, the sandy-haired 
man now known as Giles the Chan- 
cellor, who was Thorun’s constant 
companion and adviser, was to a 
great degree responsible for the re- 
lative smoothness with which the 
society of Godsmountain had 
weathered the upheavals of the past 
few days. Alas for the Brotherhood. 
Well, thought Suomi, likely a world 
with the Brotherhood victorious 
would have been no better than 
Godsmountain’s world was going to 
be without its secret demon. 

There was Schoenberg now, 
walking near his wrecked ship. 
Barbara Hurtado was at his side lis- 
tening to him as he pointed out 
features of the rubble-clearing sys- 
tem the slaves were following. It 
was a result of his expert analysis of 
the problem. He had been talking 
about it yesterday with Suomi. 
There, where Schoenberg was now 
pointing, was the place where the 
mathematically proven plan of 
greatest efficiency called for all the 
debris to be piled. Schoenberg had 
come near being killed as a colla- 
borator by Leros and the winning 
faction, but intervention by the 
demigod Karlsen had saved his life 
and restored his freedom. 

After what had happened to Ce- 
leste Servetus and Gus De La 
Torre — their mutilated bodies had 
been found atop a small mountain 
of human and animal bones in a 
secret charnel-pit far beneath the 
Temple — Suomi could not blame 
Schoenberg or anyone else for col- 
laboration. Schoenberg had told 
him of the tale of ruthless Earth- 



men who were going to come 
looking to avenge him, a tale that, 
alas, had been nothing but pure 
bluff. Suomi, though, still had the 
feeling that Schoenberg was leaving 
something out, that more than 
passed between him and Andreas 
than he was willing to recount. 

Let it lie. The ship had been 
irreparably damaged, and the sur- 
viving members of the hunting ex- 
pedition were going to have to co- 
exist on this planet, in all likeli- 
hood, for an indeterminate number 
of standard years, until some other 
ship just happened by. 

Athena took a sip of cool water 
from her fine goblet, and Suomi 
drank some more fermented milk 
from his. She had spent the period 
of crisis locked in her private room 
and unmolested — maybe she would 
have been the next day’s sacrifice— 
until the ship crashed and th£ 
Temple was knocked down about 
her ears. Even then she was only 
shaken up. She, the independent, 
self-sufficient woman, and by 
chance she had been forced to sit by 
passively like some ancient heroine 
while men fought all around her. 

“What are your plans, Carl?” 

“I suspect the citizens here will 
sooner or later get tired of having 
the demigod Karlsen around, and I 
just hope it doesn’t happen before a 
ship shows up. I think he’ll main- 
tain a low profile, as they say, until 
then.’’ 

“No, I mean Carl Suomi’s 
plans.’’ 

“Well.’’ Suddenly he wondered if 
any of the Hunterians, before the 
crisis, had heard her call him Carl, 
as she frequently did. He wondered 
if that might have contributed to 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



139 




his being so fortunately misideiiti- 
fied. Never mind. 

Well. Only a few days ago Carlos 
Suomi’s plans for his future would 
definitely have included Athena. 
But that was before he had seen her 
so avidly viewing men killing each 
other. 

No. Sorry. Of course he himself 
had now killed more people than 
she had even seen die — yet in a real 
sense he was still a pacifist, more so 
than ever in fact, and she was not. 
That was show he saw the matter, 
anyway. 

Barbara, now. She was still 
standing beside Schoenberg as he 
lectured her, but she looked over 
from time to time toward the place 
where Suomi sat. Suomi wanted 
nice things to happen to Barbara. 
Last night she had shared his bed. 
The two of them had laughed about 
their minor injuries, comparing 
bruises. But ... a playgirl. No. 
His life would go on just about the 
same if he never saw Barbara 
again. 

What, then, were hi$ plans, as 
Athena put it? Well, there were 
plenty of other fish splashing in the 
seas of Earth, or even, if he could 
be allowed a mangled metaphor, 
living demure and veiled behind 
their white walls here on Gods- 
mountain. He still wanted a 
woman, and in more ways than 
one. 

Schoenberg was not pointing up 
into the sky. Would his rubble pile 
grow that tall? Then Barbara leap- 
ed with excitement, and Suomi 
looked up and saw the ship. 

Next thing they were all running, 
shouting, looking for the emergency 
radios that Schoenberg had insisted 



on getting from the Orion and 
keeping handy. Some trying-to-be- 
helpful Hunterian had misplaced 
the radios. Never mind. The ship 
lowered rapidly, drawn by the bea- 
con-like appearance of the city atop 
the mountain, and Orion already 
sitting there. A silvery sphere, simi- 
lar in every way to Schoenberg’s 
craft. With wild waves Earthmen 
and Hunterians beckoned it to land 
on a cleared spot amid the rubble. 

Landing struts out and down, 
drive off, hatch open, landing ramp 
extruded. A tall man emerging, 
with the pallor of one probably 
raised under a dome on Venus, his 
long mustache waxed and shaped 
in the form the Earth-descended 
Venerians frequently affected. Re- 
assured by numerous signs of 
friendly welcome, he strode halfway 
down the ramp, putting on sun- 
glasses against the Hunterian noon. 
“How do, folks, Steve Kemalchek, 
Venus. Say, what happened here, 
an earthquake?’’ 

Thorun and the High Priest 
Leros were still deciding which of 
them should make the official wel- 
coming speech. Suomi moved a 
little closer to the ramp and said in- 
formally: “Something like that. 
But things are under control now.’’ 
The man looked relieved on hear- 
ing the familiar accents of an 
Earthman’s speech. “You’re from 
Earth, right? That’s your ship. Get 
any hunting in yet? I’ve just been 
up north, got a stack of trophy 
’grams in there . show you 
later.’’ He lowered his voice to a 
more confidential tone. “And, say, 
is that Tournament everything I’ve 
heard it is? Going on right now, 
ain’t it? Isn’t this the place?” •

IF 





T he idea of a series of novels 
closely related to each other is 
an old one both in general litera- 
ture and in our field. The Skylark 
and Lensman series are examples 
that come instantly to mind — E.E. 
Smith always needed more scope 
than one novel could give him to 
work out his sweeping ideas. And 
Heinlein’s use of a common history 
for his earlier stories gave a unity 
and effectiveness that added greatly 
to his reputation. More recently, 
Gordon Dickson has been using 
several separate but related novels 
to tell the history of the Dorsai. 

A series isn’t quite the same 
thing as the average sequel, to 
which I’m slightly opposed. Usually 
a sequel seems to be something the 
author thinks up when a successful 
book has already been completed, 
using pretty much the same char- 
acters and background situation, 



often without the inner conviction 
of the first book. A series of books 
requires either a larger frame or a 
more versatile character to justify 
it. It may involve direct sequels, but 
it may also use quite different char- 
acters or backgrounds — again as in 
Heinlein’s work. 

Most of these seem to grow into 
existence by their own force, com- 
pelling the writer to go on with 
them, though a few are constructed 
deliberately. Doc Smith told me he 
never meant to do more than one 
story about Seaton and Crane; he 
certainly never planned to do the 
final book about DuQuesne, the 
“villain” of the series. But he did 
expect to do several books around 
the Lens. Burroughs tried to get rid 
of Tarzan, attempting to substitute 
his son, Korak the Killer. But it 
didn’t work; Tarzan went on 
through eighteen more books, be- 



141 




coming immortal in both a literal 
and figurative sense. 

And even what seemed to be 
minor bits in that series refused to 
disappear. La of Opar was a nice 
character in the second book and 
she was even better in the sixth. But 
she wasn’t really necessary to the 
ninth — merely a welcome return. 
And finally, Burroughs went back 
to her in the fourteenth, seemingly 
compelled to bring her out and let 
her taste the more modern world — 
and to show us that Tarzan wasn’t 
by any means wholly unmoved by 
her charms. 

And Opar grew in the readers’ 
minds — that fabulous city of beast- 
ly men and beautiful women, pos- 
sessor of untellable riches, haunted 
by dawn-age religion, the sole sur- 
vivor of a great prehistoric civiliza- 
tion that might have been Atlantis. 
That city has haunted the minds of 
readers ever since Tarzan found it. 

Now Philip Jose Farmer has dug 
through the ancient past to find its 
true history, and to build a series of 
stories from this bit of another 
writer’s series. The first novel of 
this new series is his Hadoti of An- 
cient Opar (DAW, $1.25), with a 
cover and ten interior illustrations 
by Roy Krenkel. There are also 
maps and a short history of the first 
two millennia of the culture, up to 
about 10,000 B.C. 

Generally, it’s good fun. Perhaps 
the best part is the history and 
some remarks about an immortal 
time traveller (here named Sahhin- 



dar), who bears a strange resem- 
blance to hero of the author’s 
Time's Last Gift , who bore a 
strange resemblance to Tarzan of 
the Apes. Ah well, thafs Farmer 
for you; since he’s mentioned only 
casually it’s a rather pleasant con- 
ceit and ties the sub-series back to 
the main sequence. 

The story is told with no effort to 
imitate the style or narrative pace 
of Burroughs and Hadon, for better 
or worse, is no hero straight from 
Burroughs’ books. The pace is a 
good deal slower and much more 
attention to the thoughts and feel- 
ings of the characters. On its own 
merits, the ancient civilization is 
interesting and the story forms a 
rather good adventure novel. Ex- 
cept . 

Well, I’ve made my opinion plain 
about books that end without any 
real ending. This novel ends with 
our hero pursued hotly, chased into 
the hills where he makes a stand 
against his pursuers — obviously an 
almost hopeless task. And in the 
last sentence, there he stands — 
waiting. Phil, how could you! I 
know many of the early Burroughs 
books ended on a cliffhanger; I also 
know there’ll be books to follow 
this. But when one pays for a book 
he has a right to think it contains a 
story, beginning, middle — and end! 

T here isn’t really very much 
middle or end — or much good 
about them — in the latest novel of 
the series about Gor, the counter- 



142 



IF 




Earth. This is Hunters of Gor, by 
John Norman (DAW, $1.50). It’s 
the eighth book in the series; un- 
happily, I can only hope it is the 
last. 

This time the character of Tarl 
Cabot, noble warrior of Gor, is al- 
most wholly lost under his present 
guise of Bosk, the merchant Cap- 
tain. In the first half of this sprawl- 
ing book, he sets out to find and 
capture Talena, the daughter of the 
great ruler, Marlenus of Ar. Be- 
cause of love or desire to rescue the 
maiden? Nope, only for his own 
greedy ambition. He figures that 
forcing her to marry him will 
greatly advance his status. He 
makes that clear, over and over 
again. He seems to have forgotten 
that he has already been a great 
warrior and an agent of the Priest 
Kings; in fact, he asserts he no 
longer serves them. (Thereby 
cutting off one of the strongest and 
most appealing themes of the 
series.) 

So he blunders back into the 
forest where we meet the Panther 
girls once again. Heretofore, Nor- 
man has given us a strong and well- 
developed fresh culture in each of 
these books; whatever gross faults 
might intrude in the narrative, 
those backgrounds were always fas- 
cinating. But here he simply goes 
back to one he has used before — 
and perhaps the least interesting 
one. Anyhow, he finally locates not 
Talena but Marlenus, who makes a 
fool of him and sends him packing. 



Then, because he has been care- 
less, Bosk finds his entire crew cap- 
tured, and he sets out back into the 
forest where he’s suddenly the 
mighty hunter, unbelievably and 
much too simply overcoming the 
captors of the crew. He goes into 
the enemy camp single-handedly 
(and stupidly, since he has a band 
of his own by then) to overcome 
them. And, after many more words, 
he winds up no better off than be- 
fore he first set out, heading back 
again to Port Kar and the business 
he should have been tending to all 
along. Ho, hum! 

Even the sado-masochistic beat- 
ing of women which has become 
more and more a major motif of 
Norman’s work is here pretty hum- 
drum, with more repetitive quantity 
than quality. And the writing is t he 
poorest to be found in any of his 
Gor novels. 

The novel isn’t worth bothering 
with, on any level. A pity DAW 
picked up where Ballantine Books 
left off. 

and now to move toward a good 
and important series, we have 
The Dispossessed . by Ursula K. le 
Guin (Harper and Row, $7.95). 
This is a novel dealing with one of 
her worlds of the Ekumen, and a 
story which fills in a great many 
gaps in the series. 

This seems to have been a series 
which grew larger and richer in the 
author’s mind as time went on. It 
began with no more than a single

short story in 1964, which then be- 
came a part of a short novel of 
1966 — Rocannon's World ; it was a* 
good story, but not really a great 
one. But there were tantalizing 
hints of quite a history behind it 
and such devices as the ansible, 
which let men communicate from 
world to world, instantaneously 
across the huge distances of space. 
That same year, Le Guin turned to 
another world and culture in Planet 
of Exile. This was a very good novel 
of besieged descendants of human 
colonists and their allies, the half- 
human hilfs. (Hilf: Humanoid in- 
digenous life form.) There were 
vague hints that there was some 
connection between the books, but 
nothing certain. Her third novel, 
published the following year. City 
of Illusions, showed that she was 
writing a connected series — but 
also showed an Earth which was 
possessed by conquerors that were 
hard to fit into the structure, 
though they had been mentioned in 
the other books. It was a strange 
story, disturbing in some ways, but 
showing obvious talent. Then came 
a masterpiece: in 1969 I devoted 
half of my first review column for 
this magazine to praising The*Left 
Hand of Darkness, and time has es- 
tablished it as one of the classics of 
science fiction. 

By this time, it was clear that she 
was writing a tightly connected 
series, with each book on a different 
planet, showing a different culture 
of humanity; and it was now estab- 



lished that all these cultures had 
been planted in the remote past by 
a humanoid race called the Hain; 
and that now the Hain were trying 
once again to contact them and 
bring them into a vague union (as 
much philosophic as governmental) 
known as the Ekumen. 

Chronologically, The Disposses- 
sed is the first book of the series. It 
takes place on twin worlds circling 
Tau Ceti at a time not too greatly 
distant from our present, apparent- 
ly; at least Earth is a vastly polluted 
and wasted planet, totally unlike 
the forest world of the third book. 

The hero is Shevek, bom and 
raised on the bleak and barren 
world of Anarres, a world populat- 
ed by an exiled group who rebelled 
against the government of the home 
world of Urras. This group believed 
in a communal, rather anarchistic 
society, free from the rigid govern- 
ment they had known. For a more 
detailed account of this period see 
Ursula’s superb new novelette, the 
DAY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION, in 

the August ’74 issue of Galaxy. 

Baen 

Half the book (in alternate chap : 
ters of flashbacks) deals with the 
growing up and development of 
Shevek on Anarres. And all of that 
is splendid. Le Guin has faced the 
problems of putting such a theory 
of government into practice as well 
as can be done. It’s a living, strug- 
gling colony, with all the good and 
evil that man can adapt to situa- 
tions of any kind. The life is both 



144 



IF 




beautiful and horrible. The chap- 
ters describing the boy’s growth 
and the struggles of the young man 
are moving chapters indeed. 

But, as the book begins, Shevek 
has become too great a man for his 
home world. He is far ahead of all 
others of his planet in certain eso- 
teric mathematics that lead to the 
ansible that has linked these books. 
Despite the hatred toward Urras he 
shares with all Anarresti, he has to 
go down to Urras to continue his 
work. (The authorities of Urras ac- 
cept him, obviously, to steal that 
work from him.) 

Urras is a fine capitalistic planet, 
rich enough for the most extrava- 
gant capitalistic excesses. Shevek’s 
discovery of Urras’s true nature 
and his efforts to find a way to use 
his science to help Anarres make 
fine reading, as does his discovery 
of Efor, a rather humble but well- 
characterized friend. 

I wish I could go on with superla- 
tives to the end of the book, but un- 
happily the last ninety pages begin 
to slip badly. Shevek gets involved 
in a melodramatic and pointless re- 
bellion that hardly seems to fit what 
we’ve previously known of the treat- 
ment of the underground-press ele- 
ment, at least. In any event, he fails 
in his first effort. Then he simply 
turns to the “embassy” of Hain, 
gets all the help he wants, and goes 
home — where, most happily, things 
have come to a point where they’ll 
let him back. Suddenly the writer 
seems more interested in getting a 



representative of Hain onto Anarres 
than in what happens to Shevek. 

It’s not a good ending, or I 
wouldn’t have given that much of it 
away. It involves stupidity by the 
hero in jumping out without find- 
ing a few facts from Efor he could 
have learned, and then it involves a 
deus ex machina ending in the form 
of a Hain rescue. The faults are 
deeper and sadder than this brief 
summary, and they destroy much 
of the strength of the novel. After 
the marvelous ending of Darkness , 
we had to expect more of the con- 
clusion. I can only hope that some 
day the author will look at it again, 
take thought, and rewrite it into the 
truly excellent book it could be. 

Nevertheless, it’s a book that 
should be read by everyone who has 
read any of the other stories of the 
Ekumen. From the standpoint of 
the whole series, this is a key novel. 
It supplies the history and links 
that were largely lacking before. It 
shows the very beginning of what 
will become the Ekumen and of 
that which made it possible to go 
out into space to the other worlds. 

It is also an important key to any 
other novels in this series that Ms. 
Le Guin may write. And I hope she 
.will write a great many more. This 
is a series which can go on and on 
without ever losing freshness, be- 
cause each book can deal with a 
new and ever-fascinating culture 

T urning from series to individual 
books, I can’t help wondering

how Doubleday defines science fic- 
tion these days. Take as an example 
one that clearly calls itself science 
fiction on the front and backstrap 
of the jacket: The Lerios Mecca, by 
Gene Lancour (Doubleday, $4.95). 

This isn’t at all a bad book, but it 
isn’t remotely science fiction. It 
bears a resemblance to sword-and- 
sorcery, but isn’t the real thing. 
This novel depicts a world suited to 
a semi-barbarian, sword-wielding 
hero with a great quest and lovely 
(and annoying) warrior-maid beside 
him. There are strange bits of more 
ancient culture. All of which is 
good. The hero is well-done, and 
the writing much better than in 
most recent sword-and -sorcery 
books. 

But there’s almost no sorcery.

lovely fantasy, needing no disguise 
in its category. 

Imagine a world much like ours, 
back a couple hundred years. Then 
make a few changes. We know of 
Shakespeare as a great playwright. 
But in Anderson’s world, while 
Shakespeare wrote precisely the 
same things, he was a great histo- 
rian! Every word he wrote was the 
real history of the world. And the 
anachronisms we detect in Shakes- 
peare (putting certain inventions 
and devices into stories where they 
hadn’t been invented yet) are simply 
caused by the fact that in this world 
they were invented then. So, since 
inventions create more inventions, 
the Cavaliers and Roundheads have 
railways, even though Oberon still 
holds some sway and Caliban pur- 
sues his aged way where he was left. 

It’s a lovely conceit, in the old 
and noble meaning of that word. 
(My only quibble is that there are 
too many double-dotted vowels in 
the dialect; maybe we should know 
that our rustics pronounce both 
vowels in heat, but it slows up read- 
ing.) It’s not science fiction, but as 
a fantasy I can recommend it with 
pleasure. 



F inally, not one of a series, but 
one of a spate: Wild Card , by 
Raymond Hawkey & Roger Bing- 
ham (Stein and Day, $7.95). This is 
one of those disaster books that run 
from Andromeda Strain through 
Hephestos Plague , using science 



fiction tricks and terms, but meant 
for the general reader, and appar- 
ently more and more popular with 
publishers looking for quick best- 
sellers. 

However, this one is good. And it 
uses Science with both conviction 
and skill — and with consistency, 
which is the rarest quality of all in 
these books. 

The situation takes a world a few 
years from now where our society is 
becoming completely fractionated 
into struggling groups, with crime 
and violence far out of hand. The 
President is handed a report and a 
theoretical cure— the only one the 
committee could suggest, though 
obviously it is only half-serious. He 
must fake an accidental crash by a 
hostile alien spaceship, and the 
crash must result in at least 10,000 
deaths to be convincing — and the 
ship and occupants must never be 
detectable as of human origin. For 
convincing reasons, he decides to 
try it, and has a crew assembled. 

The situation and the characters 
are made believable, as is the effort 
to solve the problem, and the final 
resolution. That resolution can be 
carried still further by the reader’s 
imagination in a number of differ- 
ent ways, but it’s still a good and 
stiring ending! 

By all odds the best of such 
books, and within the limits of 
what 1^’d consider honest science 
fiction, though it isn’t so labelled. 
Exciting reading, highly recom- 
mended.

RACCOONA SHELDON

B y not much of a coincidence, 
when an alien finally landed on 
Earth he fell into the hands of a 
good guy. 

In fact he was just folding up his 
parabort heatsheet in Martin 
Brumbacher Senior’s back forty 
when young Marty came around 
the alder clump and saw him. 

“Hi,” said Marty uncertainly, 
looking at the alien’s yellow helmet 
and the khaki drawers on his 
skinny little legs, and the mess of 
gloop on the ground. “Are you, uh, 
with the survey?” 

“Como’ sta Usted?” said the 
alien. “Ich bin ein Berliner. Mukka 
hail” He slapped his helmet. “Ah! 
Hi there. Well, yes, you might say 
so. Mind holding this end?” 

He passed one corner of the heat- 
sheet to Marty and backed off to 
stretch it, gripping the edge in his 
humanoid teeth and kicking the 
middle to make it fold. He wasn’t 
much taller than Marty. 

“You sure have some junk,” said 
Marty, holding his end. “That 
looks like a flying saucer.” 

“’On’t ’ake ’em ’ike they used 
to.” The alien took the edge out of 
his mouth and folded some more, 
shaking his head. “No quality 
control.” He held out his hand for 
Marty’s end. 

“Our milker jams all the time,” 
Marty said sympathically. He look- 



ed closely at the alien’s hand and 
his eyes popped. 

The alien wrestled the heatsheet 
into a lump that suddenly became a 
toroid, jammed in a few more itqms 
and sat down on it, panting and 
gazing at Marty with large brown 
eyes above his droopy mustach. 
The toroid sizzled faintly. Marty 
stared back. 

“Nice place you have here,” the 
alien inhaled appreciatively. “Lots 
of fremth. You call those cows, 
right? I thought they were extinct.” 
“No, they’re Ayeshires.” Marty 
swallowed a couple of times. “Uh, 
Welcome to Earth. I guess.” 
“Hey, thanks!” The alien grinned 
and offered the hand. He had a 
pretty good grin. Marty shook; it 
felt okay, but hot. 

“I suppose you want to see the 
President or somebody.” 

“Oh good heavens, no, just a 
personal pleasure trip. No formali- 
ties, please.” The alien was still 
watching Marty carefully. Then he 
smiled in a relieved way. “I see 
you’re one of the good guys.” 
“What do you mean?” 

“Just checked you out on my 
Ethical Vibes ponder.” He pointed 
to a winky place on his hat. “You 
test out real high. Honest, brave, 
truthful, kind, the whole profile. 
Lucky for me. I mean, a lot of 
people are hostile to strangers.” He 



149 




shrugged apologetically. “I don’t 
have any secret zap rays or any- 
thing.” 

Marty could believe that, looking 
at him. “Yeah. It wouldn’t be so 
good if you landed by Matt’s tav- 
ern. Or the sheriff.” 

The alien nodded sadly. Then he 
brightened. “We have a saying. 
Every good guy knows at least one 
other good guy. I mean, I really 
would like to interact a little while 
I’m here, if you know somebody 
else who might accept me.” 

Marty thought. “Well, I guess 
Whelan would accept you. I saw his 
car by the creek. But he isn’t any- 
body important, he’s only the war- 
den.” 

The alien winked. “It is also 
written, good guys don’t win the 
phooplesnatch. Take me to your 
friend.” 

So Marty led the alien down to 
the creek, at the same time asking 
him a million questions about 
where was he from and so on which 
the alien answered as well as he 
could, astronomy not being Marty’s 
strong subject. 

Beside the pasture gate stood a 
muddy old station wagon. A muddy 
durable-looking man was coming 
up from the creek carrying some- 
thing. The alien stopped. 

“Whelan! Hey, Whelan!” Marty 
scrambled down, talking. 

Whelan just kept on walking. 
When he reached the car he opened 
the back and threw in a No. 2 trap 
on a chain. Then he reached back 



inside and took out a piece of paw 
and threw it in the bushes. “Bas- 
tards,” he said. “Going to kill every 
goddam thing.” He wiped his 
hands on his pants and turned to 
the alien. 

“What can I do for you, sir? 
Whelan’s the name.” 

“How do you do, Sir Whelan?” 
The alien smiled tentatively. “My 
name is, ah, Joe. Joe Smith. I’m 
from quite a ways away. I was hop- 
ing I could meet a few of you people 
and, well, talk.” He slapped the 
side of his helmet, frowning. 

“Yeah?” 

“Really quite a long way.” The 
alien slapped his hat again harder. 
A wisp of vapor arose from the 
winky place. “Damn,” he said. 

“He is an EXTRA terrestrial!” 
said Marty. “I told you.” 

“Yeah?” Whelan grinned and 
pushed his bush hat down over his 
nose. 

“I really am.” The alien gazed 
up at what he could see of Whelan’s 
eyes under the hat. “I see you 
understand bodily structure, Sir 
Whelan. Perhaps if I show you — ” 

He held up his hands, unfolding 
the extra parts. Whelan stopped 
grinning. “There is more,” the 
said shyly, starting to unzipper. 
He looked at Marty. “Perhaps if we 
just stepped to the other side of the 
car?” 

“Hey,” said Marty indignantly. 
But they stepped around to where 
he couldn’t see anything but the 
alien’s back.

IF 




When they returned Whelan’s 
hat was on the back of his neck and 
he was rubbing his head. 

“Listen, this is too much for me. 
You have to see the President or 
somebody. I better take you to the 
courthouse.” 

‘‘Oh, please, no.” The alien 
clasped his hands. “May we not 
just converse, personally?” 

“I told him about the sheriff,” 
Marty said. 

Whelan nodded,* not taking his 
eyes off the little alien. 

“What did you want to talk 
about?” 

The alien’s mustach trembled. 
“It’s all very informal, Sir Whelan. 
A mere whim. We happened to 
notice the way things were going 
here, I mean, you seemed to be hav- 
ing a few difficulties. Not your 
fault, indeed not!” He smiled hope- 
fully. “So I thought I’d drop by and 
offer a small measure of help, per- 
son-to-person as it were. That is, if 
you want it, of course.” 

“Who’s we?” Whelan demand- 
ed. 

“Oh, merely myself and two very 
close friends. We happened to be 
out this way on a pleasure jaunt. 
Absolutely nothing official in any 
way, I assure you.” 

“What kind of help? Hold it, 
Marty.” 



T he alien made an embarrassed 
gesture. “It’s only a tiny thing. 
You might not want it at all.” 



“Try me.” 

“Gladly. But — ” The alien peer- 
ed hard at Whelan. “I see you do 
realize how dangerous it can be to 
inject something totally foreign into 
an environment? The possible con- 
sequences?” 

Whelan nodded. 

“If I could assemble a few, well, 
understanding people. As I said to 
Marty, good guys. And present it to 
you as a group? You could talk it 
over and decide if it seemed desir- 
able.” 

“I guess that makes sense,” said 
Whelan slowly. 

“He says every good guy knows 
another good guy,” Marty put in. 

The alien nodded eagerly. “Sir 
Whelan, could you possibly spare 
the time to lead us to another trust- 
worthy person? You see I can only 
stay a few hours. I can’t really ex- 
plain why — hardly understand it 
myself. Perhaps you know someone 
who is familiar with a wide range of 
people?” 

“Just plain Whelan’s okay,” 
Whelan was starting a different 
sort of grin. “Sure, why not.” He 
rubbed his head. “Someone I trust 
who knows a lot of people? Well, 
there’s my wife, but she’s at the 
high school. Doc Murrey? He talks 
too much. Wait. How about Marion 
Legersky over at the clinic? She 
knows a million people and she 
doesn’t talk.” 

“She’s always talking,” objected 
Marty. 

“Yeah, but she doesn’t say any- 



ANGEL FIX 



151 




thing. She’s okay.” 

“Oh, thank you!” said the alien. 
“Do we travel in this?” 

They made room among the min- 
now traps, shovels, wire-cutters, 
flashlights, blankets, chains and 
other stuff in the wagon. ‘‘Hold on, 
Marty,” said Whelan. ‘‘Your pa 
know where you are?” 

‘‘I’ll yell as we go by.” 

‘‘Do that.” Whelan revved up 
the wagon. When they passed the 
Brumbacher gate at the top of the 
hill Marty stuck his head out and 
yelled. Nobody yelled back. 

‘‘Lovely place you have here,” 
the alien sighed. ‘‘Terfic fremth. 
Dreadful to think you might ruin 
it.” 

Whelan grunted. “What is 
tremth?" 

‘‘Oh, it’s a condition you get 
from the general electromagnetic 
configuration. Van Allen some- 
thing? I never could understand the 
explanation. Some planets have it, 
some don’t. I personally love it.” 
He wiggled his thin shoulders. 
Whelan made a racing corner and 
zoomed onto the blacktop. The 
alien clutched at the door. “Do you 
always proceed so, ah, speedily?” 
“Sometimes he goes a lot speedi- 
lier, don’t you, Whelan? Whelan 
has to catch poachers,” Marty told 
the alien. “Did you catch that real 
bad one yet, Whelan?” 

“Don’t talk about it,” said Whe- 
lan. “Listen, can’t you give me a 
hint about this help you’re offering 
us?” 



The alien twinkled shyly, like 
wait-for-Christmas. Marty could 
see he wasn’t frightened any more. 
“What would you like?” 

“Oh, Christ, Don’t quote me, 
Marty. Well, for starters — go back 
a couple of centuries and put a 
flaming sign in the sky saying any- 
body who dumps anything any- 
where has to eat it. And anybody 
begetting more than two kids 
should castrate himself. And petro- 
leum can only be extracted in the 
dark of the moon by left-handed 
virgins — that kind of thing.” 

“And Germany shouldn’t lose 
the war,” put in Marty. “Hey, Joe, 
can you? Can you?” 

The alien’s big brown eyes look- 
ed sad and his mustach drooped. 
“Oh, my dear friends, I hope I have 
not aroused false hopes. I can’t 
assist you on that sort of scale, I 
wish 1 could. Time travel . .” 
“All 1 want is for you to save the 
planet before it’s too late,” Whelan 
muttered. “Any woman wearing 
natural fur should have her nose 
cut off.” 

“Goodness.” The alien swallow- 
ed nervously. “Yes, I do sympa- 
thize. I fear that what I have to 
offer will seem very insignificant.” 
They swerved around the freezer- 
plant and rolled up Maple Street. 
“Here we are.” 



T he clinic was a one-story brick 
box in some grass. As they got 
out the front door opened and a 



152 



IF 




coat came flying out with a girl 
halfway into it. 

“Marion! Hey — Miss Legersky!” 

“Whelan!” The girl whirled 
around. “Hi, Marty! Listen, excuse 
me, I have a date. Paul called me to 
go to the game in Green Bay! 
There’s the bus. I’m gone!” 

She got her other arm in the coat, 
dropped her pocketbook and 
scooped it up running. The Grey- 
hound was down the block in front 
of Matt’s Tavern, chuffing out 
stink. 

Inside the clinic the phone start- 
ed to ring. 

Miss Legersky stopped as if an 
arrow had hit her and spun around. 

“Brenda? Where are you? She’s 
late — ” She went charging back in- 
to the clinic. When they followed 
her in she was saying, “Yes, Mrs. 
Floyd ... No, Mrs. Floyd . I’ll 
tell the doctor just as soon as he 
comes in„ Mrs. Floyd, goodbye 
now — what? Oh, yes, Mrs. Floyd, I 
truly will — ” 

Outside, the bus was making 
noises. 

“Right. Yes. Mrs. Floyd! Good- 
bye!” She ran back to the door. 
They all watched the bus pull out. 

Miss Legersky slowly took off her 
coat. “It could have been an emer- 
gency.” She sighed and looked 
around at them, her jaw out. She 
had beautiful skin. “What’s with 
you all?” 

There was a short silence and 
then everybody started telling her 
at once. 



“What? What?” She looked 
back and forth and focused on the 
alien. “What?" 

“Show her,” Marty yelled, pull- 
ing at him. 

“I think you better take a look, 
Marion,” Whelan said. “Being a 
nurse and all. The teeth,” he told 
the alien. 

The alien opened his mouth. His 
head was a little below hers. Marty 
went around behind and looked. In 
back of the alien’s front teeth were 
green and black zigzags. 

“Do you mind if I touch that?” 
Miss Legersky said faintly. “I’ll 
wash my hands.” 

“The frontals are artificial,” said 
the alien. 

When she put her finger in she 
pulled it right out. 

“Your temperature!” she cried. 
“You’re burning up!” 

“Quite normal.” The alien seem- 
ed a little embarrassed. Whelan 
started telling her about the other 
things. When the alien unfolded his 
fingers. Miss Legersky began grin- 
ning in a wild sort of way like a dog 
laughing. 

“I have a third, ah, eye, too.” 
The alien tapped his forehead. 
“Would it be all right to save that 
for later? It hurts to pull the cover 
off.” 

“I saw him land!” Marty de- 
clared. “Well, practically. He has a 
flying saucer, it’s by our gravel pit. 
Only he made it shrink.” 

Miss Legersky was grinning even 
more wildly. “You, you — you’re

153 




from outer space! You really are? 
Where ?" 

“Well, it’s over by the Hillihi- 
levio Complex. I don’t know what 
you call it. That way,’’ he pointed, 
grinning too. Everybody was grin- 
ning. 

“Why? Why’d you come? Do you 
know about us? Hey, don’t you 
have to see the President or ' the 
U.N. or something?’’ 

“Oh, no, please!” They all ex- 
plained at once. 

“You want to meet my good 
guy?” She messed her hair around. 
“Well, you made a start. Who, 
who? Oh, wow, my old boss in 

O. E.D. would be perfect, but he’s 
in Detroit. Who ?'' 

“Perhaps there is someone you 
take counsel with about your prob- 
lems?” the alien suggested. 

“My problems? Wow. Well, 
there’s three families didn’t get 
milk since January, Mrs. Riccardi 
gave me some milk powder. But 
she’s kind of erratic. Problems . 
Whelan, did you hear the sheriff is 
throwing Mrs. Kovacs off her farm, 
she’s eight-one and blind? Wait! 
Cleever. Cleever!” She seized the 
phpne. 

“If only he’s there, if he hasn’t 
quit or something. He’s the new 

P. D.,’’ she told them. “Court- 
house? Mary? Is Cleever there? 
Look, tell him to wait, please, it’s 
urgent! I’m coming over right 
away, okay, Mary?” She hung up. 
“Oh my god — Brenda! Where is 
she?” 



“Hey,” said a voice in the door- 
way, “I’m sorry I’m late, my polish 
wouldn’t dry. What’s doing? I 
mean, goodbye,” Brenda added as 
they all rushed out past her and 
piled into Whelan’s car. 

Whelan took off backwards so as 
not to pass the tavern and swooshed 
around Ray’s junkyard onto county 
road C, with Marion chattering, 
“Oh, wow, is this real? Can you 
help us? Can you really, really?” 
“It’s just a tiny thing,” the alien 
said humbly. “It may not be 
anything you want at all.” 

“What / want? Oh, hey, I 
can’t — Whelan, is this real ?” 
“Could be,” Shelan said cau- 
tiously. “Courthouse, right?” 

“My goodness, the fremth ,” the 
alien sighed. “You just can’t ima- 
gine. Glorious.” 

''Fremth is Van Allen belts,’* 
Marty explained. “He digs it. Hey, 
Joe, what’s your planet like? Is it all 
right if I call you Joe? Are you from 
the Galactic Federation?” 

“What’s that?” the alien asked. 
“Oh, yes, please, Joe.” 

“Hello, Joe, I’m Marion. Look, 
Whelan, there’s the Moellers, they 
lost their food stamps. Next time 
you confiscate some meat could 
you—” 

“They have too goddam many 
kids,” Whelan said. “Besides, it’s 
illegal. Okay.” 

T he wagon shot over the old 
bridge and past the Hecker- 
Giodano pulp works and around 



154 



IF 




the Foxy Cabins and the Frigo 
cheese factory into the back end of 
town. The courthouse had a pizza- 
colored tower. Whelan turned into 
some service ruts and parked be- 
hind a couple of rusty school buses. 

“Close as we go.” They all 
climbed out and hurried around 
the buses and across the parking lot 
to the courthouse’s back porch. In- 
side next to the garbage cans was a 
door saying edgar cleever, jr. 

PUBLIC DEFENDER. 

“Cleever!” Marion rushed them 
all in and started introducing. 
Cleever was a long tea-colored 
young Chippewa with a mean ex-, 
pression. He said ‘How do’ all 
around, sneering impartially. 

“Oh, Cleever, you won’t believe 
this, but Joe’s from outer space. I 
mean, he isn’t from Earth. He 
came to help us, isn’t that tremen- 
dous?” 

Cleever’s squint stopped on the 
alien. 

“I saw him land,” said Marty. 

“H e showed us, Cleever. I mean, 

I believe it. 1 really do!” 

Cleever squinted at Whelan. 
Whelan cleared his throat. “Looks 
like,” he said. 

Cleever’s eyes narrowed to two 
black pinholes focused on the alien. 
“Doesn’t he talk? Where’s his 
interstellar translator?” 

“Actually I don’t have one,” the 
alien spoke up timidly. “It isn’t 
really necessary.” 

“Ah, the faint British accent,” 
said Cleever. “What’d you say his 



name was?” 

“Joe Smith,” Whelan told him 
uncomfortably. 

“Well, it’s really more like Sora- 
josojojorghtha ,” the alien interject- 
ed. “Joe seemed easier. I just made 
up the Smith part.” 

“So what are you selling? This 
isn’t my day for jollity.” Cleever 
picked up some papers but one ear 
stayed trained on the alien. 

“Oh dear,” the alien swallowed. 
“Obviously I must First satisfy you 
that 1 really am from off-planet.” 

“Good thinking.” 

“Well, of course, minor physical 
aspects — ” The alien held out his 
hands and wiggled everything. “But 
I see that isn’t really convincing.” 

“No,” said Cleever shortly. 

“I feared not.” The alien started 
tugging at his zippers. Marty just 
got a glimpse of black, wet-looking 
things before Whelan hauled him 
away. Marion took two steps back, 
her eyes bugging out. 

Cleever just looked in silence. 
His mouth drew down at the ends 
into two angry cuts. He blinked 
twice and slowly shook his head. 

“Sorry. 1 really am sorry. But 
no.” 

The alien sighed, zipping up. He 
started to pick at his forehead, 
wincing a little. A big piece of skin 
peeled away. Above his nose was a 
jelly place. 

“That’s not an eye,” said Marty 
indignantly. 

The alien was holding a plastic 
cup to his forehead. He leaned his 



ANGEL FIX 



155 




head down and bounced a couple of 
times. When he straightened up 
everybody could see. 

“Oooh,” breathed Marion. 

It wasn’t like his other eyes but 
more like a soft, shiny little animal 
looking out, straight at Cleever. His 
other eyes looked at Cleever too. 

Cleever stared back with terrible 
ferocity. His fingers hit three drum- 
taps on the desk. Presently the 
third eye left Cleever and swiveled 
around to look at them all. It 
winked. 

Cleever cleared his throat, once, 
twice. He stretched a hand out 
toward the alien. The alien nodded 
and leaned across the desk. Very 
carefully, Cleever touched the eye. 
It sort of ducked. Cleever pulled 
back and exhaled, scowling 
viciously. 

“Okay.” He shook himself. 
“Okay. Provisionally. Now what? 
Whaf s the scenario? Not the ulti- 
matum, by any chance?” 

“Oh, mercy no,” said the alien. 
“Oh, no! Purely a friendly call. 
Look, would it be all right if I put 
this back? It’s a bit . 

“Go ahead. What’s your friendly 
calling on behalf of? The last 
‘friendly aliens’ we had here didn’t 
turn out so good.” 

“He says he wants to give us 
something,” said Whelan. 

“Aha,” Cleever snorted. 

The alien had his head back, 
putting the jelly in. 

“We,” he said muffledly. “I 
mean, my two companions and I 



happened to pass nearby and we 
couldn’t help noticing that things 
weren’t too happy with you. Quite 
distressing, in fact. Perilous.” He 
smooshed the skin back. “Does this 
look all right? We’ve had our 
calamities too, alas. So I recalled 
something — a very small item, you 
understand — that might be helpful 
and I thought I’d drop by to see'if 
you cared to try it.” 

“How much?” Cleever demand- 
ed. 

“Oh Cleever,” Marion protested. 
“He’s not selling anything — he 
wants to help.” 

“That’s right,” the alien told 
him eagerly. “We have a saying, 
The good guys have to link to- 
gether.” 

“Good guys. What’s that sup- 
posed to mean? I don’t dig the 
black-hat- white-hat line myself.” 

“Yes, forgive me. A slang expres- 
sion. How to put it?” The alien 
chewed on his big mustach. “Well, 
in situations like yours one does 
find persons — so few, alas — who 
are trying to help rather than 
seeking status or power or ma- 
terial—” 

“You keep saying help. What do 
you mean? Everybody thinks he’s 
helping. General Custer was help- 
ing.” 

“Of course.” The alien peered at 
him anxiously. “Would it help — 
excuse me — could I say, people to 
whom the pain felt by others is 
real? All the pain, the waste. Em- 
pathetic, is that it? So real that they 



156 



IF 




try to, well, stop it?” 

“That’s beautiful,” said Marion. 
“Okay, okay,” Cleever grunted. 
“So what do you want?” 

“To make my modest offer of as- 
sistance.” 

“Make it.” 

The alien looked around, count- 
ing. “I had hoped for at least one 
more ... for diversity ...” His 
voice trailed off timidly. 

“He wants like a panel,” Whelan 
explained. “To decide if it would 
mess things up.” 

“Who do you want? Ralph 
Nader? Margaret Mead? Billy Gra- 
ham? Bella Abzug?” 

“He wants your good guy!” said 
Marty. 

The alien nodded. “If you could 
possibly lead us to someone, well, 
experienced in the larger ethical 
implications? Not an official, 
please. Someone you would trust 
with a secret of great power.” 

“Oh, wow!” said Marion. 
“Larger ethical implications.” 
Cleever shook his head slowly, star- 
ing hard at the alien. “Well, may- 
be. Provided any of this is real, 
which I doubt. Let me think. Judge 
Ball was on my orals, he knows 
every implication there is. I guess I 
trust the old bastard. I’d love to see 
his face — ” Cleever was slashing 
around in his desk. Suddenly he 
stopped. “Listen, if this turns out 
funny I’m going to rip you apart. 
You know that?” 

The alien quailed. “Oh, I assure 
you . .” 



“Be warned.” Cleever picked up 
the phone. “Oh hell, no way. He’s 
in Denver. Next week?” 

“Oh dear, it does have to be 
sooner. Today, actually. My friends 
were very emphatic.” 

“I should have my brain ser- 
viced,” Cleever sneered at the 
alien. “Look, why don’t you go save 
the world someplace else?” 

“Hey!” said Marion. “Doctor 
Lukas. How about him? I was in

signed from N.I.H. because of, you 
know, Cleever. I told you.” 

“Lukas? Isn’t he in some kind of 
scientific advisory crap now?” 
“He’s down at State annex. Pike 
River, it’s only forty miles.” 

“Call him.” 

“Oh god, I couldn’t,” she wail- 
ed. But when Cleever got through 
to Lukas’ secretary Marion made 
quite a good speech about how she 
was an ex-student and something of 
tremendous scientific significance 
had come up and could they please 
have ten minutes of his time? When 
the secretary gave in and said Yes 
Cleever hung his Gone Hunting 
sign on the door and they all tore 
out and jumped into Whelan’s 
wagon with the minnow bait and 
stuff. 

“What makes you trust Lukas, 
Marion?” Cleever asked as the 
party hurtled down Interstate 101. 
It was a gorgeous Northlands day. 
The alien was fluttering his hand 
out the window and asking Marty 
the names of things.

“Oh, 1 don’t know.’’ Marion 
laughed. “The flinch, I guess.’’ 

“What flinch?’’ 

“You know. Like all the stuff in 
the news and after awhile you can’t 
react any more, it’s all so horrible, 
but you go on flinching. Like, 
twenty million babies starving to 
death someplace, flinch. Old people 
abused in stinking nursing homes, 
flinch, flinch. Eighty billion for 
new superbombs, flinch-flinch- 
flinch. You flinch, Cleever. I see 
you.’’ 

“No, Chippewas don’t flinch,’’ 
Cleevor snapped. Then he said, 
“Oh, shit.’’ 



asiren bansheed up deafeningly 
rV behind them. 

“It’s him. Oh, no.’’ 

They rolled onto the verge and 
waited. Boots clumped. Then Whe- 
lan’s window was filled with a 
khaki-colored bag of rocks. It had 
badges and belts on it. 

“Hello, folks.’’ 

“Hello, Sheriff,’’ Whelan said 
tonelessly. 

“I got to talk to you, boy. What 
kind of shit you trying to pull with 
Charlie Orr? ’Scuse me, Miss.’’ 
The sheriffs large face came down 
to see who belonged to the legs. 
When he saw he stopped smiling, 
which was on the whole an improve- 
ment. 

“Orr had eight deer carcasses or 
parts thereof in his panel,’’ Whelan 
told him. 



“He says you tried to drive him 
off the road at over one hundred 
miles per hour.’’ 

“Well, he didn’t want to stop. I 
had my flasher going, I just eased 
up behind and nudged him a 
little.’.’ 

“Goddam dangerous driving. 
That car of yours could kill some- 
body.’’ The sheriff was still bent 
down, taking them all in with his 
round blue eyes. “You got stuff on 
this car that’s illegal, Whelan. You 
setting up to be a law enforcement 
officer? I got to write you up, boy.’’ 

Whelan said nothing. 

“Quite a party, I see. Say, you’re 
Brumbacher’s boy. Your pa know 
you’re going around with these 
people?’’ 

“We told him,” said Marty. 

“Yeah? I think I’ll tell him, too. 
You — ” He jerked his chin at the 
alien. “You new in town?” 

“Oh yes sir! I truly am!” They 
could feel the alien quivering. 
“Merely passing through, really!” 

“Keep it that way. He your law- 
yer?” 

“Oh dear me, no indeed! I — ” 
Cleever nudged him and he shut 
up. 

“Birds of a feather,” grunted the 
sheriff. He pulled his head back 
out. “I want you in my office first 
thing tomorrow, Whelan. Hear? 
And bring this unsafe vehicle with 
you.” 

“The charge stands against 
Orr,” Whelan said. 

“Sure, sure.” The sheriff chuckl-

ed and slapped the car roof. At that 
instant the alien sneezed, or some- 
thing. A big ring of lavendar light 
whipped through the wagon and 
out the window. 

The sheriffs face zoomed down 
at them. 

“You got fireworks in this car!” 

“Oh, no! No!” cried everybody 
but Cleever. 

The sheriff slapped the roof 
again, hard. “All right, everybody 
out.” He jerked the door open by 
Marion. 

“Warrant?” said Cleever. 

The sheriff rolled his lips and 
spit out some gum. 

“On my authority as sheriff of 
this county I’m ordering you to as- 
sist an officer of the law in perfor- 
mance of his duties. Namely, 
checking possession of illegal fire- 
works. Out.” He grabbed Marion’s 
arm. 

Cleever started unfolding him- 
self. “Let go of her, Claude.” 

“Look!” cried the alien, pointing 
ahead. 

A car was roaring at them fast, 
some kind of soap-dish body on big 
fat tires. Hairy heads were blowing 
out of the top. 

“Haughgh!” said the sheriff, 
letting go of Marion. 

The strange car was almost on 
top of them. It fish-tailed onto the 
gravel, showing stones and screech- 
ed back into the road by the 
sheriff s cruiser. Ping-g-g! 

The sheriff bellowed and took off 
for his car. The kids got straighten- 



ed out and clouted down the road. 
There were big letters painted on 
the back. The cruiser tore into a U- 
turn and took after them, throwing 
gravel all over. 

W helan started up and whoosh- 
ed them out of there. 

“Never saw them before,” he 
said. “What was that, a built-up 
VW?” 

“It said ‘Love’,” Marion giggled. 
“In purple. Oh, wow, was he mad. 
I hope he doesn’t catch them.” 

“It did not,” Marty told her. “It 
said Claude Eats Dandruff.” 

“I saw it. Love.” 

“Actually, it said White Man 
Drop Dead,” said Cleever. “And it 
was a green ’67 Pontiac.” 

“I’m sorry,” said the alien. “It’s 
hard with so many people. I blur.” 
“Huh?” 

“You mean you did that?” 
Cleever said. 

The alien smiled modestly. 
“Well, I thought — I hope it was all 
right?” 

“Oh, it was perfect! Oh, wow! 
Ho ho ho!” cried Marion. 

“You mean they weren’t, they — 
Hey!” Marty bounced around to 
face the alien. “Do some more! Do 
some monsters!” 

“Oh, I’m not very good at it. It 
has to be in one’s head. That is, the 
person’s head, I mean.” He tugged 
his mustach again. “Ah, Miss 
Legersky — ” 

“Marion.” 

“Marion ... I must apologize.

That phone call. Mrs., ah, Floyd. 
That was me.” 

“What do you mean? I heard 
her.” 

% “No, really. Nobody called. I did 
it from your head. I’m so sorry.” 
“You mean Mrs. Floyd never 
called? But — but, why?” 

“I had to be sure about you,” the 
alien said pleadingly. “My, my de- 
vice seems to have quit working.” 
“His ethical vibrator,” Marty ex- 
plained. “It’s in his hat. I saw 
smoke, Joe.” 

“Yes. Absolute junk. So I 
thought, make a test. The worst 
thing a person is worried about. 
I’m terribly sorry.” 

“You mean, to see if I’d an- 
swer.” She rumpled her hair, 
staring blankly at the scenery which 
was rushing by behind some Won- 
derbread ads. “Cleever, just when I 
was leaving, I mean, -Paul asked 
me — I guess he did,” she looked 
around. The alien nodded. “Any- 
way, Brenda was late and Mrs. 
Floyd called — only it wasn’t Mrs. 
Floyd. But the voice and all — ” 

“I am so sorry.” The alien’s big 
brown eyes glistened. “Your mat- 
ing ritual ...” he said miserably. 

“Oh, Joe, it doesn’t matter.” She 
patted his hand. “I wouldn’t have 
missed this for anything. And 
you’re trying to help us.” 

“I do hope you won’t be dis- 
appointed.” He clasped her hand. 
“It’s such a tiny thing.” 

“You have beautiful eyes, Joe.” 
She hugged his shoulders. He 



beamed. 

“Testing,” Cleever said. “I don’t 
recall you trying anything on me. 
Why not? Professional courtesy?” 
“Oh, I looked at you,” the alien 
told him shyly. 

“It occurs to me,” Cleever was 
squinting again. “Maybe we should 
have some kind of test. Just for 
openers, does everybody see this 
guy the way I do? Whelan, mind 
telling us what Joe here looks like?” 
They all started describing the 
alien and checking and arguing, 
while they flew past the oil loading 
rack and across the Soo tracks and 
around Earl’s Trailer Court and 
over the bridge into Pine River. 

“Oh, Cleever, what does it 
matter about his earlobes,” Marion 
said. “We all see him. Slow down, 
Whelan, there’s the campus.” 

“I don’t know,’’ Cleever said 
darkly as they rolled into the park- 
ing under a lot of maples. “I wish 
my grandpa was here with his Win- 
digo trap.” The alien shuddered. 

“Life Sciences, she said.’’ 
Marion pointed. “That motel-look- 
ing one.” 

They scrambled out from among 
the axes and jerry-cans and trooped 
into the Life Sciences motel and 
found T. H. LUKAS, PH.D., M.D. On 
a door. Inside was a small office 
about ten degrees below zero. 

“The air-conditioner,” his sec- 
retary sneezed. “Go right on in.” 
“Oh, it’s fine,” the alien assured 
her. “Really brings out the 
fremth. ” He followed them into

Lukas’ cubbyhole, shivering plea- 
surably. 

I ukas turned out to be a sturdy 
j little man with a white pom- 
padour, like a serious show-pony. 

“Take over, Marion,” Cleever 
said. 

“Oh, wow,” said Marion and 
plunged at it. Just as she was saying 
“outer space” the door opened and 
the secretary walked in carrying a 
yellow paper. 

“Excuse me.” 

Lukas opened it and started 
reading. As he read he slowly back- 
ed himself up until he hit the wall. 
The paper shook a little and his 
face paled. 

Marty suddenly made a loud in- 
hale and Whelan clamped him 
from behind. 

“Shall I send an answer?” The 
secretary didn’t look well either. 

“No . Oh, yes, of course, 
Miss Timmons. Ah. Dear Harry. 
Sincere — no, many congratulations 
on your appointment. You have all 
my support. Signed Theo.” 

“Doctor Lukas, I — I’m so sorry.” 
He made a vague gesture. 
“Thank you, Miss Timmons. 
These things . One must hope, 
the realization of power sometimes 
ameliorates . .“ 

“I know what the realization 
of power will do for him .” Miss 
Timmons marched out. 

Lukas smiled a little effortfully 
and pulled himself back to his 
desk. “Do forgive me — Miss Leger- 



sky, isn’t it? Please continue.” 

She’d just started to talk when 
the alien murmured something and 
quickly sidled out the door. 
“Oops,” said Cleever and whipped 
out after him. Marion went on talk- 
ing. 

When they came back in Lukas 
was standing up. 

“You . .?” He peered at the 
alien, shaking his white head and 
smiling tiredly. 

“The eye,” said Cleever. “Show 
him.” 

“It isn’t really necessary now.” 
The alien’s mustach seemed to have 
perked up. 

“I know. You better tell him 
that, too. She’ll send that wire.” 

“Oh, no,” the alien shook his 
head, smoothing his mustach. “I 
have an electronic sweet-tooth,” he 
confided. Then he sobered. 
“Doctor Lukas, I must apologize 
for your distress. That telegram 
does not exist.” 

“What?” 

“Oh, /oc!” cried Marion. 

“Really. Look on your desk, 
where you put it. Nothing there.” 

There wasn’t. Lukas ran around 
looking, with his eyebrows going 
higher and higher. 

“That’s his thing,” Cleever ex- 
plained. “Testing. He says he uses 
the worst thing you can think of.” 

“Only in emergencies,” said the 
alien. “It’s very draining. Please 
forgive me.” 

“Amazing!” Lukas blinked and 
began to smile. “Well! Yes, my

goodness! That certainly is a feat, 
Mr. Joe, is it? But, regretfully, I 
cannot accept it as, ah . 

“Of course,” the alien agreed. 

So they showed him everything, 
with Lukas getting more and more 
excited. By the time they were do- 
ing the eye his eyebrows were up by 
his pompadour and he was peering 
at the alien with a pocket lens. 

“A pineal analog? Impossible, 
see the ancillary structures . 
Why, that isn’t hair, either — ” The 
eye swiveled, apparently enjoying 
itself. 

“We should get to the business,” 
Whelan interrupted. “I’d like to 
see this gismo he has.” 

“Button up, Joe. Somebody 
might come in.” 

“Well, well, well!” Lukas re- 
peated while the alien put himself 
together. “Well! Now. Whom to 
call first?” 

“No, no! No!” They told him. 
The alien began to explain about 
how this was a private thing he 
wanted to offer to a small group. 
He was choosing his words with 
great care, glancing nervously at 
CleeVer. 

“ — persons of, how shall I EX- 
PRESS IT? Of altruistic tempera- 
ment, of low dominance-submis- 
sion orientation? Unexploitative?” 

Lukas looked puzzled. 

“I see in your mind the terms 
non-agonistic behavior’. Pro- 
nounced et-epimeletic tendencies?” 

“Ah,” Lukas replied. “You mean 
the good guys!” Marion giggled. 



“But how marvelous! You offer 
to help us? You really mean this?” 

“In a small way.” The alien 
started feeling around in his cloth- 
ing. “A very small way. That is if 
you . .” He frowned, tried an- 
other place. 

Lukas was gazing over their 
heads. “An inhibition, perhaps, 
against destroying each other? Such 
as Lorenz — so petitically if quite 
unfoundedly — believes is to be seen 
among wolves? We do seem to need 
it more than wolves.” Absently he 
rubbed a tattooed place on his arm. 
“Is such a thing possible?” He de- 
manded urgently, “Can you stop 
man destroying man?” 

“There goes the planet,” said 
Whelan. 

The alien’s face was sorrowful. 
“Doctor Lukas, I regret. What you 
suggest is possible, in a way. But it 
would require — Oh, to begin with, 
an official project, a huge organiza- 
tion, funding, authorizations, co- 
ordinations, impact studies ... I 
see you understand.” 

Cleever snorted. 

“Yes.” Lukas breathed out blow- 
ly. “I understand.” 

“I’m so sorry about your family,” 
the alien said softly. 

Lukas started. “You really do 
read minds?” 

“When the thought is so prom- 
inent.” 

“And you can’t bring back the 
dead either, I’m sure. Or — 
could — ” Lukas’ face changed. 
“Oh, no. Forgive me. But now, let

us see! What do you bring?” 

T he alien pulled out a small 
crumpled packet which prompt- 
ly swelled up into a lobed pouch. 

“It’s quite safe,” the alien said. 
“Now, the point is — ” 

There was a very fast knock on 
the door as Miss Timmons came in. 

“Doctor Lukas, may I use your 
phone? My line is dead.” 

“Oh,” said the alien. “Ah, Doc- 
tor Lukas.” 

“So that’s what you were doing,” 
Cleever said. “Sir, maybe you 
should mention about the tele- 
gram.” 

“Of course. Miss Timmons, it 
won’t be necessary to send that 
wire. I have determined that the 
message was an, ah, error.” 

“A joke,” Cleever added grimly. 
“What a perverted, horrible — ” 
“Yes, yes, it’s quite all right.” 
Lukas smiled at her. She glared at 
each of them in turn and strode 
out. 

“I should repair it,” the alien 
said anxiously. 

“Later, we don’t want any calls.” 
“True. Well, as 1 was saying, the 
point is fatigue.” 

“Fatigue?” they echoed blankly. 
“Yes, on the part of the good 
guys. We have a sayjng, the good 
guys get all the unclean matter.” 

“I follow you,” said Whelan. 
“And we say also, good guys are 
stupid enough to care. So they keep 
tryirig. But there are so few of them 
and they are always suffering hurts 



and defeats and unclean matter. A 
terrible strain. They become tired.” 

He looked around. Nobody 
nodded; nobody had to. 

“And so they wear out, they 
weaken. Unable to go on. Perhaps 
dead. The society suffers, error and 
evil triumph. So I thought to bring 
you refreshment, for the good 
guys.” 

“Drugs,” grunted Cleever. 
“Shit. ” 

“Oh, no!’’ The alien looked 
shocked. “Tell me — have none of 
you experienced a desire to go away 
for a time? To have a secret beau- 
tiful place free from evil and greed, 
without — is ‘hassles’ the word? 
Wait — ’’ He looked at Marion. 
“Where there is only sympathy and 
understanding and the deer and the 
antelope play?” 

“Ohhh,” breathed Marion. “You 
mean like vacations?” Then her 
smile faded. “I went to Yellow- 
stone. It’s wall-to-wall crud.” 

“A travel agent.” Cleever’s teeth 
showed. 

“Oh, please, this is a gift! A very 
modest gift, I’m afraid. But you 
see,” the alien said earnestly, “We 
have experienced these problems. 
Really. We learned that if one can 
relieve the stress for a time one re- 
turns refreshed. Renewed! Able to 
carry on, to accomplish more. To 
flourish like the green tree.” 

“Hey Joe, where is it?” Marty 
asked. “How do we go?” 

“Observe, please.’’ The alien 
opened a lobe of the bundle. An ob-

ject fell out. “No, wait; wrong cul- 
ture.” He pushed it back and tried 
another. 

“That looked like an Afro 
comb,” Marion said. Everybody 
was peereing madly. 

“I do hope you like it.” The alien 
pulled out a shiny little thing. 

“Car keys?" 

“For camouflage. Unremarkable 
and owned by everyone, is it not? 
Now, if you will move back from 
the center of the room — good, 
good. See. I hold the key up, so, 
and tap upon it. Twelve times.” 

His finger made twelve even taps. 

“Ooohh! Ahhh!” 

In the middle of the room stood a 
faint, shimmery bubble about the 
size of a big refrigerator. 

“That is the gate. Now, to 
enter — ” 

“Wait one minute,” said Whe- 
lan. “What’s in there?” 

“Oh, nothing at the moment. 
See — it’s quite empty.” The alien 
walked into the bubble and out 
again, waving his arms. “It syn- 
chronizes two points. You go in 
here and come out there. I forget 
the technical name, time-indepen- 
dent-null-dimensional-something. 
Our transportation industry makes 
it.” 

“Does it work?” asked Marty. 

“Oh yes. They haven’t recalled 
one for ages.” 

“I thought you came here in a 
flying saucer,” Cleever said. 

“Oh, naturally. I didn’t need a 
permanent hook-up, you wouldn’t 



build a highway just for one — ” 

“Okay.” 

“Where does it go? I want to try 
it,” Marty and Marion said to- 
gether. 

“Ao,” Cleever and Whelan spoke 
as one. 

Lukas advanced on the bubble 
and thrust his hand in. “I am the 
oldest; I am expendable. I shall test 
it.” 

“Oh, no, Doctor Lukas — ” 

But the alien was already show- 
ing him. “When you are inside, tap 
the key again like this.” He tapped 
three slow, three fast, three slow. 
“Your emergency signal, I believe? 
To come back, just re-enter and re- 
peat the taps.” He handed Lukas 
the key. “Please come right back, 
won’t you? Your friends are bound 
to worry. Oh, I do hope he likes it,” 
the alien added as Lukas advanced 
into the bubble. 

They saw his pompadour lift 
slightly, like a brush charge. He 
held up the key and tapped it. 
Nothing happened. 

The alien put his head in and 
said something. Cleever snickered. 

“It has to be quite forceful,” the 
alien said apologetically when his 
head came out. “This is a used 
model. But very reliable, I assure 
you.” 

“Sure, sure,” said Cleever. They 
could see Lukas tapping hard. 

All of a sudden he and the 
bubble weren’t there any more. 

“Holy mother of us all,” whis- 
pered Whelan.

“Is he all right?” asked Marion 
breathlessly just as the door opened 
and Miss Timmons’ head came in. 

“Is everything all right. Profes- 
sor? Doctor Lukas! Where is he?” 

“He stepped out for a minute,” 
Marty said loudly. “Hah hah hah!” 
Whelan grabbed him. 

“D-didn’t you see him go by?” 
said Marion. “He said he’d be right 
back.” 

The phone in the outer office 
rang. Miss Timmons looked to and 
fro wildly and finally backed out. 
Cleever went over and leaned on the 
door. 



<< A LL ri ght, you. Get him back , ” 
Cleever snarled. 

“Oh, I can't — ” The alien took 
one look and scooted behind 
Marion. “Please, do not — ” 

The bubble and Lukas suddenly 
popped back in the middle of the 
room. Lukas stepped out slowly, a 
strange expression on his face. 

“Virgin . .” he said to the 
alien. “It’s virgin, isn’t it? The 
air — ” He sniffed. “I hadn’t realiz- 
ed it was so foul here. But so 
lonely ...” He turned to the 
others. “Yes. You find yourself in a 
large, a very large pavillion. Look- 
ing out upon a virgin world. All 
quite empty.” 

“The reception area. We put it 
up,” the alien said. “Did you like 
it?” 

“Let me, let us,” the others 
clamored. 



“Of course!” The alien handed 
keys around. “May I suggest you go 
in pairs? The bubbles must be in 
different spots, you see. Perhaps if 
we push this desk?” 

As they pushed Miss Timmons 
began to pound on the door. Lukas 
stuck his head out. “Elvira, do not 
be alarmed. Everything is quite all 
right. We’re working on some- 
thing.” 

He turned back just in time to 
see Marion and Cleever go bubble- 
pop. The next minute Whelan and 
Marty were gone too. 

Lukas leaned on the desk, puff- 
ing a bit. “Do you think,” he asked 
the alien, “Elvira — Miss Timmons 
has been with me for years. Might 
it be possible — ?” 

“Oh, I want you to bring 
friends!” the alien beamed. “And 
your friends shall bring friends, as 
many as possible shall have refresh- 
ment! But — Doctor Lukas, this is 
very serious; you must impress it on 
them after I have gone: The gate is 
for good guys only . You see, there 
is a scanning device, I have no idea 
how it works. It’s sensitive to, well, 
emotions. If a person who eman- 
ates hate or cruelty or greed tries to 
use it, it goes null. Ffftf” He ges- 
tured. “Key, person, all gone. So 
you see why I was so careful in test- 
ing you.” 

“The needle’s eye,” Lukas mar- 
veled. “God in heaven, it’s the 
needle’s eye.” He looked sharply at 
the alien. 

“Oh, no, no!” said the alien,

backing up a little. “An ordinary 
being, I assure you. A mere techno- 
logical convenience.” 

“I see . .” Lukas rubbed his 
arm absently. “Well, surely if I 
passed Elvira need not fear.” He 
drowned. “But how is it you have 
such a planet empty? It seemed a 
paradise.” 

“No fremth ,” the alien told him. 
“So many are like that, your place 
here is quite an exception. The 
magnetic field-forms,” he explain- 
ed, as Marion and Cleever popped 
back into the room. 

They came out both talking at 
once. 

“Did you like it?” the alien ask- 
ed eagerly. 

Marion just kept on saying, “Oh, 
oh, oh.” Cleever took a deep 
breath. 

“Yeah. When do the developers 
arrive?” 

“It appears they don’t!” Lukas 
was telling them what the alien had 
said when Marty and Whelan 
popped out in the corner. 

“Man,” said Whelan. “Did you 
see those mountains? Sure hated to 
come back.” 

“And the big lake,” shouted 
Marty. “Is that the ocean? Hey, 
Cleever, I bet there’s buffalo 
there!” 

“Chippewas don’t dig buffalo,” 
Cleever told him. He seemed un- 
usually springy on his feet. 

,“And the flowers, the sun,” 
Marion sighed. “I bet you could 
grow stuff in that meadow by just 



throwing down seeds.” 

“Wait,” Whelan said. “How do 
we know the soil isn’t poisonous to 
us? Or the water, how about that?” 
“Completely compatible/’ the 
alien assured them. “Of course we 
only sampled here and there, but 
you and I are much alike. Very 
common. Be cautious. I did eat 
quite a few fruits. Delicious!” 
“You were there?” 

“When we made the pavillions. 
Now please — Did you like it? Will 
it provide refreshment? Do you 
think it will help?” 

“Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!” They were 
all grinning, even Cleever. Marion 
hugged the little alien. “You’ve 
made such a beautiful thing for us, 
how can we ever thank you?” 

The alien glowed, beamed, 
tugged his mustach. “Oh, it was 
nothing. Foam, mostly. You may 
have to fix the roof. Oh dear,” he 
looked at Whelan. “The time! 
Could you take me back to my 
ship?” 

“This I must see.” Doctor Lukas 
raised his voice surprisingly. “Miss 
Timmons! Elvira! Cancel every- 
thing for today — and wait!” 

They all swarmed out clasping 
their keys and climbed in among 
Whelan’s water samples and 
bumper-jacks. When they were 
bowling back up 101 the alien said, 
“Now I mustn’t forget anything.” 
And he went over what he’d told 
Lukas about bringing their friends 
but being careful about it. 

“Imagine!” said Marion. “A

whole planet full of only good 
guys!” 

“Not too damn full,” said Whe- 
lan. 

“Cati I bring my raccoon?” 
Marty asked. 

“There goes the ecological bal- 
ance.” Whelan groaned. But he 
kept on grinning. 

“Raccoons are good guys!” 

“Before we get into an ethical 
evaluation of raccoons let’s see if 
there’s anything more he should tell 
us,” said Cleever. 

“I nearly forgot,” the alien said, 
“There’s a key-dispenser by the 
washrooms. I think you should 
always carry two, don’t you? In 
case you lose one.” 

“What happens if the wrong guy 
finds a key?” 

“Oh, it’s most unlikely anyone 
would perform the code by chance. 
But if he did, well, that would be 
the end of that. I’m afraid.” 

“Hey,” Marion said, “Let’s give 
the sheriff one!” 

The alien looked at her. She 
caught his eye and her head began 
to go back and forth. No. “. it 
was just a thought.” 

“Watch those thoughts,” said 
Cleever. 

“I wouldn’t contaminate it!” she 
said indignantly. “Oh, I can’t wait. 
I’m going to find some of that fruit 
for Mrs. Kovacs.” 

T he alien sighed happily. “I’m 
so gratified. If only my next 
stop goes as well.” 



“Where? Who?” they asked. 

“We thought, a nucleus in each 
large land mass, you know. Just 
time. I go down that way — Brazil, 
is it? And one more place. I have it 
coded.” 

“That explains the Afro combs,” 
Cleever muttered. “You won’t be 
too lonesome, Doctor.” 

“But good guys,” Marion re- 
minded him. 

“I thought I saw something move 
just as we were leaving,” Whelan 
said. “Over on the far side.” 

“Really! Oh, how marvelous, 
that means one of my friends has 
found a suitable group. What good 
news. We worried about that, you 
know?” He smiled bravely. “We’re 
quite vulnerable. You are some- 
what intimidating, you know.” 

Marion hugged him some more 
and they alternately chattered in 
bursts, then fell silent in excited 
thoughts while Whelan zoomed 
them back up the highway and 
bounced into the shortcut to 
Marty’s father’s farm. 

“We’re going to kick ourselves 
for not asking you a couple of mil- 
lion things,” Cleever said as they 
rushed over the last hill. “Oh Jesus. 
In the yard.” 

They peered out as the Brum- 
bacher farm went by. 

The sheriffs cruiser was stand- 
ing by the pigsty. 

“Keep on going!” Marty yelled. 
“The creek’s out of sight.” 

“He’s going to bust out after us 
in two shakes.” Whelan kept going,

watching the mirror. “There! He’s 
running out of the barn.” 

“Quickly,” th alien was wriggling 
around, pulling tubes out of his 
suit. “If you will just drop me 
where we came out. I can use my in- 
visibility inducer.” He pulled out 
some grids. “I hope.” 

“Can’t you make a monster?” 
Marty asked as they shot down the 
hill. 

The alien connected things fran- 
tically. “I’m so tired. This is much 
easier — if it works.” 

Behind them they heard the 
sheriff s car, Vrrooomm. 

“We shan’t see your vehicle,” 
said Lukas disappointedly. 

“We won’t see you again,” 
Marion cried. “Oh, Joe dear! 
Please come back!” 

The alien was pushing part of his 
apparatus into his mouth. His eyes 
rolled appealingly and he tried to 
nod. Whelan stood on the brakes. 
They were by the creek gate. 

The vrroomm got louder. 

“Here he comes, Hurry, Joe!” 
The alien scrambled out: His in- 
visibility thing uncurled down 
around his shoulders like an over- 
wrought tuba. He straightened up 
and started working various but- 
tons. Nothing happened. 

“Hurry, Joe! Hurry!" 

The alien’s eyes popped, he 
fiddled and punched feverishly, 
backing into the gate to push it 
ajar. A siren blared to life at the top 
of the hill. 

“Look, he’s shimmering! He’s 



thinning out!” 

“Oh, goodbye, goodbye! Dear 
Joe, thank you!” 

The sheriffs car was scorching 
down the hill, warble-horn going. 

“Good luck, Joe! Oh, thank 
you!” 

“Hey — his /bof!” 

The alien had melted into a heat- 
wavy place in the air except for one 
solid foot. It ended in a pinkish 
blur. The foot stamped a couple of 
times and they heard a faint voice, 
apparently swearing. 

Just as the cruiser growled up be- 
side them the foot turned and 
started hopping through the gate. 

“Marty, you better get out,” said 
Whelan through his teeth. “Just 
bringing him home,” he shouted at 
the sheriff. 

Everybody was trying not to look 
at the solitary foot leaping down the 
pasture path. “See you later,” they 
said to Marty as he climbed out and 
headed back up the road to his 
house. 

The sheriffs face came down to 
the window. 

“You — the guy with the fire- 
works. Okay, out.” 

“I am Professor Theodore Lukas 
of the state university department 
of Life Sciences,” said Lukas 
stiffly. “Mr. Whelan is assisting me 
in a scientific investigation.” 

“Professor, huh?” The sheriffs 
blue stare jabbed around. Then, 
surprisingly, he straightened up 
and slapped the roof. 

“All right, move on. Move on, 



168 



IF 




you’re blocking the road.” 

“He’s overdue at Matt’s about 
now,” Whelan explained as they 
moved briskly on. “Oh, man. 
Know what I’m going to do? Soon 
as we get the professor home I’m 
going to pick up some groceries and 
take Helen back on the old logging 
road. Nobody’ll find the car. We’re 
going to have ourselves a weekend 
in heaven!” 

“You won’t be alone,” they 
laughed. 

“I hope to Christ these keys work 
better than his invisibility whoosis,” 
said Cleever. 

“We’ll have to watch out for 
Marty.” Marion was sniffling a 
little. “Oh, I wonder, will he ever 
come back? He was such a sweet 
person.” 

“It just occurred to me,” Cleever 
remarked reflectively. “He never 
did use that thing himself.” 

“Oh, Cleever!'' 

***** :************************* 

B ack in the pasture the alien was 
humming happily as he expand- 
ed the modules of his little ship. He 
wajs thinking about coming back. 
Every so often he stood up and 
shivered, letting the fremth do its 
stuff. 

When he had everything assem- 
bled he opened his communicator 
circuits, keeping one eye on an 
Ayeshire heifer who was becoming 
curious. An excited voice answered 
him. 



“You can’t guess what I ran 
into,” the voice chattered in his 
own language. “A whole town full 
of heavy disarmament types! From 
all over. Place called Geneva. One 
of them’s already planning to move 
his family out. How’d you do? Hey, 
is the fremth this good where you 
are?” 

“Fantastic,” said the alien 
known as Joe. “My group went 
beautifully, such nice people. I feel 
sure that they and their friends will 
decide to leave this planet per- 
manently after a very few visits.” 

“Mine too,” the voice chuckled. 
“And as we always say, when all the 
good guys go, goodbye planet. 
How’s Shushli doing? If he’s having 
the same luck we’ll have this place 
ready to go in no time.” 

“Shushli here,” said a new voice. 
“I’m doing great, in fact I’m 
running out of keys. Place called 
Siberia. Pathetic, isn’t it? Abso- 
lutely ripe. I tell you, there won’t be 
a sane mind left on this planet in a 
couple of their ridiculously short 
generations.” 

“Yeah,” said Joe happily. “I just 
hope the sickies don’t mess the 
place too badly before they wipe 
themselves out. Well, I must move 
along. Shoo! — Not you, a cow. An 
animal.” Joe stood up and took one 
last shiver. “Listen, guys, we better 
start thinking about our sales bro- 
chures: And be sure to stick an 
official seal on your recorders, will 
you? You know — folks will never 
believe the fremth.”

Or not tube . that is the question. 




after being stranded in Afghan- 
rV istan one develops caution. 

But then, there are blue sky deals 
and there are blue chip deals. One 
of these days I’ll be back on top 
again but for the moment things 
are in their usual state of bloody 
flux. That’s 18th century slang for 



an illness that .... Oh well, it all 
boils down to the same thing. 

Lower than Educational TV, 
what can you get? They were 
getting me. When an agent asks, 
“B.J., would you like to do some- 
thing for NET?” the answer is some 
crushing and original variant on, 



170 




“You’ve got to be kidding.” But 
one says those things when all is 
well. At the moment, thanks to 
some bandit who forgot the ones in 
the Khyber Pass are real bandits, I 
needed money. So I took up three 
minutes saying, “Sure I can do it.” 

After the landlady and the ali- 
mony were stalled off for another 
week I sat down and tried to figure 
out what I had to do. Educational 
TV for Christ’s sake! Next I’ll be 
barking for trained fleas. 

A uniform topped with a pimply 
face pounded on the door and 
handed me a large manila envelope. 
I signed and outstared him for the 
tip. When I spread the material 
over the table I had to admit it 
wasn’t bad. In fact it was so good I 
even got to wondering if maybe I 
wouldn’t like to watch that kind of 
program myself some wintry eve- 
ning — if I could ever bring myself 
to watch anything, that is. 

It was anthropological do-it- 
yourself.. By the time a viewer got 
through seeing an Indian pressure- 
flake flint he’d be able to fake a 
Folsom point as well as the next 
man. One program would demon- 
strate how Polynesians dig out a 
canoe using nothing but fire and 
shells. A man was going to build a 
log cabin with a stone axe. Another 
program would show cabinet-mak- 
ing techniques in 11th dynasty 

Egypt- 

The only unusual thing about the 
program was the budget and shoot- 
ing requirements; this thing had a 



robber baron’s Conscience Fund 
Foundation behind it and some- 
body wanted no studio work, no 
process, no dramatization, none of 
the usual fakery — and color yet! 
Christ amighty, half of those spare 
bedroom NET studios couldn’t even 
transmit color and yet the old 
robber baron’s nervous nephews 
wanted it all Super Colossal! 

It was going to cost money — lots 
of it. And I was going to get some of 
the wonderful stuff. Common sense 
returned and called my bank. No, 
the check hadn’t bounced. Yes, 
credit had been authorized up to 
ten mill — I was excited again. 

W ord gets around in this busi- 
ness. I didn’t call — they 
called me. In three days I had a 
company. 

We started blocking out scripts 
and Honig went to work breaking 
the first one down into a shooting 
script — which makes no sense to an 
outsider but one hell of a lot to an 
accountant since it puts scenes not 
in chronological order, but in eco- 
nomical sequence to use available 
light and keep the cast together. Do 
all water-hole shots in one day, for 
example, even if they’re going to be 
sprinkled through twenty-six finish- 
ed films. 

I rescued a cello-throated Shake- 
spearean playing pageants in Taos 
and we had our voice-over with 
enough gray-haired good looks left 
to do the intros. It was going well 
under budget. 



171 




It promised to be really good, 
miles above the usual prime-time 
shlock. 

And then I ran into trouble. 

You expect trouble in this busi- 
ness: public outcry — all the usual 
crap about shlock programming 
and payola for broadcasting 
licenses. But here I’m trying to put 
out a good program — the kind of 
program a guy who reads without 
moving his lips might enjoy watch- 
ing — and the F.C.C. was giving me 
all kinds of static! 

I told my agent to get the Con- 
science Fund Foundation on it and 
next morning he got me out of bed 
to explain that the fine print laid 
that part of it all on me. 

I got hold of an expert in Wash- 
ington who knew how to grease the 
agency. Nobody could be fixed. 
That’s when I started getting sus- 
picious. There is always somebody 
with his hand out. 

There’s a kind of mentality that 
sees deep dark plots in everything. 
Something to do with a deprived 
childhood or not enough breast 
feeding or some damn thing. After 
a week of horsing around getting 
nowhere I started developing that 
kind of mentality. 

I can understand payola. I can 
understand having to grease some- 
body to get things moving. I can 
even understand some freshman 
senator making vote-getting noises 
about Vast Wastelands. But here I 
was trying to produce something 
really good and nobody in the gov- 



ernment seemed to be interested— 
not just uninterested; they went out 
of their way to make things impos- 
sible. 

“Who hates you?” my agent 
asked. 

“Somebody down there doesn’t 
like me,’’ I conceded. But I really 
couldn’t think of anybody-^not 
that t haven’t made enemies — but 
none of them were in a position to 
sabotage things the way this project 
was going down the spout. 

Then I got another phone call. 

“Mr. Gortiz?” 

“Yes.’’ 

“This is Edgar Pendergast.” 

I tried to remember the name but 
nothing happened. I made frantic 
motions for my girl to do what she 
should have done before connecting 
me but she was tripping out over a 
wad of gum. 

“I’m vice president of the Con- 
science Fund Foundation,’’ Pen- 
dergast said. Suddenly the chill 
wind of an Afghanistan winter shot 
through my soul. 

“We’ve been reconsidering,” 
Pendergast said in round, founda- 
tion-shaped tones. “I’nr afraid we 
are going to have to call the project 
off.” 

Before I could remind him that 
we had a contract he continued, 
“We’ll pay you, of course. And you 
might want to keep your troupe to- 
gether. Perhaps in a month or so, 
once the dust has settled we can get 
together and dream up some other 
kind of public service program.” 



172 



IF 




I mumbled something and got 
off the line. 

I t just didn’t make sense. Sure, 
I’ve been shafted before. But not 
this way. It was as if the Conscience 
Fund Foundation really did have a 
conscience. Somebody felt guilty 
and somebody was buying me. 
What for? 

Now that my immediate finan- 
cial worries were over I had another 
problem. You’re only as good as 
your last and my last hadn’t hap- 
pened — though I had sixteen cases 
of exposed film sitting in my apart- 
ment, next to my television set. I 
had to get something going soon or 
I’d end up in some goddam wax 
museum. Besides, it bent me out of 
shape. The first time in my life I 
ever tried to produce a really good 
program and here I was, shafted up 
to the sweetbreads. 

I decided to do something wild, 
crazy, extravagant. With my own 
money I hired an investigator. Not 
a hundred-dollar-a-day divorce ex- 
pert. Not a Watergate Wonder- 
Boy. The guy I hired called himself 
an advocate. I called him a lobby- 
ist. 

There’s nothing deader on this 
whole festering planet than a dead 
TV deal. 

But I wanted to know why . 
Personally, I tended toward the 
deep dark plot theory, but then I’m 
paranoid. Besides, now that it had 
been killed somebody should have 
been gloating, and making sure I 



found out why. 

While my high-voltage gumshoe 
was padding down the corridors of 
power I considered the possibilities. 
There were plenty of ordinary com- 
monplace ones but they would all 
have gossiped back to me by now. 
Suddenly another one hit me. That 
whole goddam series of anthropolo- 
gical do-it-yourself — it had been a 
survival course! 

Somebody knew something. I 
started watching Walter Cronkite. 
Same old crap. The Cambodians 
had finally gotten it through their 
little heads that if Glorious Leader 
didn’t get those MIA’s back soon 
the silent majority probably 
wouldn’t say a word after the Bomb 
was dropped, except maybe to 
suggest the second one land on 
Sweden. But Kissingkraut must 
have convinced Moscow and Peking 
too. Things hadn’t looked better 
for a generation. The Arabs were 
even hinting that some of their best 
friends . 

Scratch one theory. 

At home Glorious Leader was 
screwing the poor, welshing on 
every campaign promise and giving 
it all to the little men in black 
pyjamas who had suddenly become 
our allies, essential to our best 
interests in ... It was business as 
usual. 

The dollar was dropping, Europe 
was screaming, and it wasn’t really 
all that bad now that young Euro- 
peans were buying Mustangs in- 
stead of Black Forest Brand X.

The Russians were going for 
color TV in a big way. Every coun- 
try had its own color network now. 
China had agreed not to jam the 
satellite relays. It looked like we 
were going to be just one big happy 
family, even if Old Glorious had re- 
versed himself again and cut off the 
programs that might have kept that 
family down to manageable size. So 
why was somebody stopping me 
from producing a decent TV pro- 
gram? 

It had to be a conspiracy. I’d 
tried too hard, run into too many 
stone walls. Two weeks and nobody 
had snickered or gloated. Some- 
where in a back room evil men in 
hoods sat around a table and . 

My gumshoe rang me. “You’re 
not alone,’’ he said. “Bill Buckley’s 
been canceled.’’ 

“So what else is new?’’ 

“Doesn’t it strike you odd that in 
spite of all the government’s feud- 
ing with the media, just about 
everything right-of-center is getting 
canceled?’’ 

“Of course it’s odd. Now tell me 
why it’s odd.” For this I’m paying a 
gumshoe real devalued American 
dollars? 

“I’m working on that,” he said 
and hung up. 

Meanwhile, not only was I watch- 
ing Walter Cronkite; I was starting 
to read the papers. I even read the 
classifieds. 

It was no use. No cryptic ‘per- 
sonals’. No little men in hole-in- 
the-wall stores to lead me into 



extradimensional adventures. Even 
the ‘object, carnal knowledge’ ads 
were unimaginative. 

One of the more image-minded 
corporations was getting hit with 
another anti-trust suit in return for 
its latest public-service program 
educating the citizenry in the outs 
of government. A communications 
conglomerate was being warned 
about a radiation hazard in their 
new line of color TV’s but since a 
jap set selling at half the price and 
emitting twice the radiation was 
outselling them that was the least of 
their worries. Somebody was prom- 
ising gasoline rationing this summer 
and no fuel oil this winter. 
America’s birthrate was at its low- 
est since World War II. Somebody 
in Africa was starving, having man- 
aged to outbreed Borlaug’s Miracle 
Mealie-mealies. And my gumshoe 
was still running up a bill. I de- 
cided to call him off and fold up the 
company while I still had a dime 
left for my old age. 

M y agent called. “Everything 
is supercolossal again!” 
“We’re going to do the series?” 
“No, that one’s dead and gone.” 
“So what is it this time?” 
“Situation comedy — This POW 
comes home after nine yers. He’s 
never seen a mini, doesn’t even 
know brassieres will burn.” 
“Where’s the comedy?” 

“Each episode his wife comes on 
with something new. First off, she’s 
living with three other guys. Next 



174 



IF 




one, we put his daughter in a com- 
mune.” 

“This is comedy?” 

“It all depends on the treat- 
ment.” 

“You don’t want me; you need 
Evelyn Waugh.” 

“Don’t you want to do the 
show?” 

”1 didn’t say that,” I sighed. “It 
just takes a little getting used to.” 

“So it’s on?” 

“Yeah.” 

“You don’t sound very happy 
about it.” 

“I’m delighted.” I hung up and 
poured myself a drink. Here was 
my chance for another Emmy. 
Ought to top Archie Bunker any 
day. I hadn’t disbanded my com- 
pany yet. Better Call Honig and get 
him to working up a shooting 
schedule. Shlock Rides Again! You 
could bet your life nobody was go- 
ing to shoot this one down. An ad- 
ministration that favored the crap 
that was going out in prime time 
now would stand for anything — ex- 
cept intelligence or good taste. 

Suddenly a great light burst. I 
wondered if this was what the mys- 
tics meant when they maundered 
on about Illumination. To me it, 
was more like an old fashioned car- 
toon. I could almost see the light 
bulb encased in a little balloon 
floating over my head. The trouble 
was, I had a production company. 
Now who the hell knew anything 
about the technical side of the 
business? 



I found the man I wanted.- Not in 
a TV repair shop where you might 
expect. 

“Ruined,” the X-ray technician 
said. “I don’t know where you’ve 
been storing it but this film’s 
picked up enough radiation to 
sterilize twenty generations of fruit 
flies and half the population of 
Biafra.” 

Knowing that I’d been expecting 
that answer did nothing to stop the 
sinking feeling in my stomach. At 
last I knew why. Now my only 
problem was ethical. Knowing why 
didn’t tell me what to do about it. 

People were made to be man- 
aged. I’d been producing shlock all 
my life, reminding myself each time 
I went to the bank that Mencken 
was right: No man ever went broke 
under estimating the American 
taste. So I’d done one decent thing 
in my life— tried to produce a good 
TV program. And what had it 
gotten me? 

I’ll do the POW comedy. Why 
not? Somebody else would anyway, 
But I really wonder. I wonder if, 
twenty years from now when the 
Selecting is all done, somebody 
might not discover that his kids 
watch shlock too? Somebody 
watches those cruddy shows. And 
since when can even a Right Wing 
mother convince her precious 
genetic heir not to glue his nose to 
that X-ray emitter? But you don’t 
catch me watching that gonad- 
shriveling shlock. From now on I’m 
not even watching Cronkite!
