“We’re looking for people 
who want to write” 


By Gordon Carroll 

Director, Famous Writers School. Former 
editor, Reader’s Digest, Time, Inc., Coronet 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
I would like to test your writing aptitude. 
We’ll help you find out if you can be 
trained to become a successful writer. 

Several years ago, we started the 
Famous Writers School. Our aim was to 
help qualified people acquire the skills 
they need to break into print. We poured 
everything we knew about writing into 
a new kind of professional training 
course, which you take at home and in 
your free time. After a solid grounding 
in fundamentals, you get advanced train- 
ing in the specialty of your choice— Fic- 
tion, Non-Fiction, Advertising or Busi- 
ness Writing. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers or editors. 
Your instructor spends up to two hours 
analyzing your work. He blue-pencils 
corrections right on it — much as an 
editor does with established writers. 
Then he returns it to you with a long 
personal letter of advice and specific 
recommendations. 

This training works well. Our students 
have sold their writing to more than 100 


publications including Reader's Digest , 
True, Redbook. 

Stephen Novak of Wayne, N. J., says, 
“I just received a check from Ellery 
Queen s Mystery Magazine . That’s 1 1 
stories sold in six months.” Doris Steb- 
bins of S. Coventry, Conn., who has sold 
six stories to Woman's Day for $2,050 
writes, “Taking your Course has made 
it all possible.” 

Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you can benefit from this 
training, send for the School’s Aptitude 
Test. If you test well, or offer other evi- 
dence of writing ability you may enroll. 
But there is no obligation to do so.

THE HUGO WINNERS 


L ast Labor Day weekend, at the 
Cleveland World Science Fic- 
tion Convention, If was awarded the 
trophy called the “Hugo” — a 
polished chromium spaceship mount- 
ed on a wood base, suitably in- 
scribed — as the leading science- 
fiction magazine in the world. 

To celebrate, we decided to col- 
lect as many of our fellow Hugo- 
winners in one issue as we could 
. and this is the issue. With us, 
therefore, axe: 

Isaac Asimov, who won the Hugo 
for “best all-time science-fiction 
series” with his Foundation stories; 

Harlan Ellison, who won the 
short-story Hugo for “Repent, Har- 
lequin /” Cried the Tick-Tock Man, 
originally published in Galaxy; 

And Roger Zelazny, who shared 
the best novel Hugo in a tie with 
Frank Herbert. 

We had also hoped to have Frank 
Herbert and this year’s Hugo-win- 
ning Artist, Frank Frazetta, but 
fate and bad luck conspired against 
us. Frazetta at the last moment was 
deluged with priority assignments 


and couldn’t complete his cover; 
Herbert, recovering from a seige 
of hospitalization, has a story for 
us but not in time for this issue. 
We regret their absence, but we’re 
proud to have Asimov, Zelazny and 
Ellison with us . and for lag- 
niappe we’ve added a short poem 
by the convention’s Guest of Honor, 
L. Sprague de Camp. 

A ll this is our way of saying 
“Thanks!” for the Hugo. We’ll 
go on saying thanks the best way 
we can, by trying, to bring you the 
best stories to be had. Van Vogt 
will be back with us before long; A. 
Bertram Chandler will be with us 
next issue; after that we’ve got 
first-rate novelettes and short nov- 
els by Philip Jose Farmer, Hal 
Clements, Samuel R. Delany and — 
oh, yes — Andre Norton, appear- 
ing in If in the June issue with a 
complete short novel called War- 
lock's World. 

Anybody we’re missing? Let us 
know — and we’ll try to get them 
too! — The Editor

can imagine him wondering. What 
do we mean by “rise”? Can we be 
certain that tomorrow will come? Is 
the term “sun” completely unam- 
biguous in this connection? 

Add to this habit of speech a 
bland countenance, rather pale, with 
no expression except for a general 
look of uncertainty; gray hair, rather 
thin, neatly combed; business suits 
of an invariably conservative cut; 
and you have what Professor James 
Priss was — a retiring person, com- 
pletely lacking in magnetism. 

That’s why nobody in the world, 
except myself, could possibly suspect 
him of being a murderer. And even 
I am not sure. After all, he was 
slow-thinking; he was always slow- 
thinking. Is it conceivable that at one 
crucial moment, he managed to think 
quickly and act at once? 

It doesn’t matter. Even if he mur- 
dered, he got away with it. It is far 
too late now to try to reverse matters, 
and I wouldn’t succeed in doing so 
even if I decided to let this be pub- 
lished. 

E dward Bloom was Priss’s class- 
mate in college, and an associ- 
ate through circumstance for a gen- 
eration afterward. They were equal 
in age and in their propensity for 
the bachelor life, but opposites in 
everything else that mattered. 

Bloom was a living flash of light; 
colorful, tall, broad, loud, brash and 
self-confident. He had a mind that 
resembled a meteor-strike in the sud- 
den and unexpected way it could 
seize the essential. He was no theore- 
tician, as Priss was; Bloom had 
neither the patience for it, nor the 


capacity to concentrate intense 
thought upon a single abstract point. 
He admitted that. He boasted of it. 

What he did have was an uncanny 
way of seeing the application of a 
theory, of seeing the manner in which 
it could be put to use. In the cold 
marble block of abstract structure, 
he could see, without apparent dif- 
ficulty, the intricate design of a mar- 
velous device. The block would fall 
apart at his touch and leave the de- 
vice. 

It is a well known story, and not 
too badly exaggerated at that, that 
nothing Bloom ever built had failed 
to work, or to be patentable, or to 
be profitable. By the time he was 45, 
he was one of the richest men on 
Earth. 

And if Bloom the Technician were 
adapted to one particular matter 
more than anything else, it was to 
the way of thought of Priss the 
Theoretician. Bloom’s greatest gad- 
gets were built upon Priss’s greatest 
thoughts, and as Bloom grew weal- 
thy and famous, Priss gained phe- 
nomenal respect among his col- 
leagues. 

Naturally, it was to be expected 
that when Priss advanced his Two- 
Field Theory, Bloom would set about 
at once to build the first practical 
anti-gravity device. 

II 

M y job was to find human in- 
terest in the Two-Field Theory 
for the subscribers to Tele-News 
Press, and you get that by trying to 
deal with human beings and not 
with abstract ideas. Since my inter- 


THE BILLIARD BALL 


7 



viewee was Professor Priss, that 
wasn’t easy. 

Naturally, I was going to ask about 
the possibilities of anti-gravity, 
which interested everyone; and not 
about the Two-Field Theory, which 
no one could understand. 

“Anti-gravity?” Priss compressed 
his pale lips and considered. “I’m 
not entirely sure that it is possible. 
Or ever will be. I haven’t — uh — 
worked the matter out to my satis- 
faction. I don’t entirely see whether 
the Two-Field equations would have 
a finite solution, which they would 
have to have, of course, if — ” And 
then he went off into a brown study. 

I prodded him. “Bloom says he 
thinks such a device can be built.” 

Priss nodded. “Well, yes, but I 
wonder. Ed Bloom has had an amaz- 
ing knack at seeing the unobvious in 
the past. He has an unusual mind. 
It’s certainly made him rich enough.” 

We were sitting in Priss’s apart- 
ment. Ordinary middle-class. I 
couldn’t help a quick glance this 
way and that. Priss was not wealthy. 

I don’t think he read my mind. 
He saw me look. And I think it was 
on his mind. He said, “Wealth isn’t 
the usual reward for the pure sci- 
entist. Or even a particularly desir- 
able one.” 

Maybe so, at that, I thought. 
Priss certainly had his own kind of 
reward. He was the third person in 
history to win two Nobel Prizes; and 
the first to have both of them in 
the sciences and both of them unshar- 
ed. You can’t complain about that. 
And if he wasn’t rich, neither was he 
poor. 

But he didn’t sound like a con- 


tented man. Maybe it wasn’t Bloom’s 
wealth alone that irked Priss. May- 
be it was Bloom’s fame among the 
people of Earth generally; maybe it 
was the fact that Bloom was a cele- 
brity wherever he went, whereas 
Priss, outside scientific conventions 
and faculty clubs, was largely anony- 
mous. 

I can’t say how much of all this 
was in my eyes or in the way I 
wrinkled the creases in my forehead, 
but Priss went on to say, “But we’re 
friends, you know. We play billiards 
once or twice a week. I beat him 
regularly.” 

(I never published that statement. 
I checked it with Bloom, who made 
a long counter-statement that be- 
gan: “He beat me at billiards. That 
jackass — ” and grew increasingly 
personal thereafter. As a matter of 
fact, neither one was a novice at bil- 
liards. I watched them play once for 
a short while, after the statement and 
counter-statement, and both handled 
the cue with professional aplomb. 
What’s more, both played for blood, 
and there was no friendship in the 
game that I could see.) 

I said, “Would you care to pre- 
dict whether Bloom will manage to 
build an anti-gravity device?” 

“You mean would I commit my- 
self to anything? Hmm. Well, let’s 
consider, young man. Just what do 
we mean by anti-gravity? Our con- 
ception of gravity is built around 
Einstein’s General Theory of Re- 
lativity, which is now a century and 
a half old but which, within its lim- 
its, remains firm. We can picture 
it — ” 

I listened politely. I’d heard Priss 

IF 


8 



on the subject before, but if I was 
to get anything out of him — which 
wasn’t certain — I’d have to let him 
work his way through in his own 
way. 

“We can picture it,” he said, “by 
imagining the universe to be a flat, 
thin, super-flexible sheet of untear- 
able rubber. If we picture mass as 
being associated with weight, as it 
is on the surface of the Earth, then 
we would expect a mass, resting up- 
on the rubber sheet, to make an in- 
dentation. The greater the mass, the 
deeper the indentation. 

“In the actual universe,” he went 
on, “all sorts of masses exist, and 
so our rubber sheet must be pictured 
as riddled with indentations. Any ob- 
ject rolling along the sheet would 
dip into and out of the indentations 
it passed, veering and changing direc- 
tion as it did so. It is this veer and 
change of direction that we interpret 
as demonstrating the existence of a 
force of gravity. If the moving ob- 
ject comes close enough to the cen- 
ter of the indentation and is moving 
slowly enough, it gets trapped and 
whirls round and round that inden- 
tation. In the absence of friction, it 
keeps up that whirl forever. In other 
words, what Isaac Newton inter- 
preted as a force, Albert Einstein in- 
terpreted as geometrical distortion.” 

H e paused at this point. He had 
been speaking fairly fluently — 
for him — since he was saying 
something he had said often before. 
But now he began to pick his way. 

He said, “So in trying to produce 
anti-gravity, we are trying to alter 
the geometry of the universe. If we 


carry on our metaphor, we are trying 
to straighten out the indented rubber 
sheet. We could imagine ourselves 
getting under the indenting mass and 
lifting it upward, supporting it so as 
to prevent it from making an inden- 
tation. If we make the rubber sheet 
flat in that way, then we create a* 
universe — or at least a portion of 
the universe — in which gravity 
doesn’t exist. A rolling body would 
pass the non-indenting mass without 
altering its direction of travel a bit, 
and we could interpret this as mean- 
ing that the mass was exerting no 
gravitational force. In order to ac- 
complish this feat, however, we need 
a mass equivalent to the indenting 
mass. To produce anti-gravity on 
Earth in this way, we would have to 
make use of a mass equal to that of 
Earth and poise it above our heads, 
so to speak.” 

I interrupted him. “But your Two- 
Field Theory — ” 

“Exactly. General Relativity does 
not explain both the gravitational 
field and the electromagnetic field in 
a single set of equations. Einstein 
spent half his life searching for that 
single set — for a Unified Field 
Theory — and failed. All who fol- 
lowed Einstein also failed. I, how- 
ever, began with the assumption that 
there were two fields that could not 
be unified and followed the conse- 
quences, which I can explain, in part, 
in terms of the rubber-sheet meta- 
phor.” 

Now we came to something I 
wasn’t sure I had ever heard before. 
“How does that go?” I asked. 

“Suppose that, instead of trying to 
lift the indenting mass, we try to stif- 


THE BILLIARD BALL 


9 



fen the sheet itself, make it less in- 
dentable. It would contract, at least 
over a small area, and become flat- 
ter. Gravity would weaken. And so 
would mass, for the two are essen- 
tially the same phenomenon in terms 
of the indented Universe. If we could 
make the rubber sheet completely 
flat, both gravity and mass would dis- 
appear altogether. 

“Under the proper conditions, the 
electromagnetic field could be made 
to counter the gravitational field and 
serve to stiffen the indented fabric of 
the universe. The electromagnetic 
field is tremendously stronger than 
the gravitational field, so the former 
could be made to overcome the lat- 
ter.” 

I said, uncertainly, “But you say 
‘under the proper conditions.’ Can 
those proper conditions you speak 
of be achieved, Professor?” 

“That is what I don’t know,” said 
Priss, thoughtfully and slowly. “If 
the universe were really a rubber 
sheet, its stiffness would have to 
reach an infinite value before it 
could be expected to remain com- 
pletely flat under an indenting mass. 
I f that is also so in the real universe, 
then an infinitely intense electromag- 
netic field would be required, and 
that would mean anti-gravity would 
be impossible.” 

“But Bloom says — ” 

“Yes, I imagine Bloom thinks a 
finite field will do, if it can be prop- 
erly applied. Still, however ingenious 
he is,” and Priss smiled narrowly, 
“we needn’t take him to be infallible. 
His grasp on theory is quite faulty. 
He - — he never earned his college 
degree, did you know that?” 


I was about to say that I knew 
that. After all, everyone did. But 
there was a touch of eagerness in 
Priss’s voice as he said it, and I look- 
ed up in time to catch animation in 
his eye, as though he were delighted 
to spread that piece of news. So I 
nodded my head as if I were filing it 
for future reference. 

“Then you would say, Professor 
Priss,” I prodded again, “that Bloom 
is probably wrong and that anti- 
gravity is impossible?” 

And finally Priss nodded and said, 
“The gravitational field can be weak- 
ened, of course, but if by anti-gravi- 
ty we mean a true zero-gravity field 
— no gravity at all over a significant 
volume of space — then I suspect 
anti-gravity may turn out to be im- 
possible, despite Bloom.” 

And I rather had what I wanted. 

Ill 

I wasn’t able to see Bloom for near- 
ly three months after that, and 
when I did see him he was in an 
angry mood. 

He had grown angry at once, of 
oourse, when the news first broke 
concerning Priss’s statement. He let 
it be known that Priss would be in- 
vited to the eventual display of the 
anti-gravity device as soon as it was 
constructed and would even be ask- 
ed to participate in the demonstra- 
tion. 

Some reporter (not me, unfor- 
tunately) caught him between ap- 
pointments and asked him to elabo- 
rate on that, and he said: 

“I’ll have the device eventually; 
soon, maybe. And you can be there, 


10 


IF 




THE BILLIARD BALL 


11 



and so can anyone else the press 
would care to have there. And Pro- 
fessor James Priss can be there. He 
can represent Theoretical Science, 
and after I have demonstrated anti- 
gravity, he can adjust his theory to 
explain it. I’m sure he will know how 
to make his adjustments in masterly 
fashion and show exactly why I 
couldn’t possibly have failed. He 
might do it now and save time, but 
I suppose he won’t.” 

It was all said very politely, but 
you could hear the snarl under the 
rapid flow of words. 

Yet he continued his occasional 
game of billiards with Priss, and 
when the two met they behaved with 
complete propriety. One could tell 
the progress Bloom was making by 
their respective attitudes to the press. 
Bloom grew curt and even snappish, 
while Priss developed an increasing 
good humor. 

When my umpteenth request for 
an interview with Bloom was finally 
accepted, I wondered if perhaps that 
meant a break in Bloom’s quest. I 
had a little day-dream of him an- 
nouncing final success to me. 

It didn’t work out that way. He 
met me in his office at Bloom En- 
terprises in upstate New York. It 
was a wonderful setting; well away 
from any populated area, elaborate- 
ly landscaped, and covering as much 
ground as a rather large industrial 
establishment. Edison at his height, 
two centuries ago, had never been as 
phenomenally successful as Bloom. 

But Bloom was not in a good hu- 
mor. He came striding in ten minutes 
late and went snarling past his sec- 
retary’s desk with the barest nod in 


my direction. He was wearing a lab 
coat, unbuttoned. 

He threw himself into his chair 
and said, “I’m sorry if I’ve kept you 
waiting, but I didn’t have as much 
time as I had hoped.” Bloom was a 
born showman and knew better than 
to antagonize the press, but I had the 
feeling he was having a great deal of 
difficulty at that moment in adhering 
to this principle. 

I made the obvious guess. “I am 
given to understand, sir, that your 
recent tests have been unsuccessful.” 

“Who told you that?” 

“I would say it was general knowl- 
edge, Mr. Bloom.” 

“No, it isn’t. Don’t say that, young 
man! There is no general knowledge 
about what goes on in my labora- 
tories and workshops. You’re stating 
the professor’s opinions, aren’t you? 

“No, I’m — ” 

“Of course you are! Aren’t you 
the one to whom he made that state- 
ment — that anti-gravity is impossi- 
ble?” 

“He didn’t make the statement 
that flatly.” 

“He never says anything flatly. 
But it was flat enough for him. And 
not as flat as I’ll have his damned 
rubber-sheet universe before I’m fin- 
ished.” 

“Then does that mean you’re 
making progress, Mr. Bloom?” 

“You know I am,” he said with a 
snap. “Or you should know. Weren’t 
you there at the demonstration last 
week?” 

“Yes, I was.” 

I judged Bloom to be in trouble, 
or he wouldn’t be mentioning that 
demonstration. It worked, but it was 


12 


IF 



not a world beater. Between the two 
poles of a magnet a region of lessen- 
ed gravity was produced. 

I t was done very cleverly. A Moss- 
bauer Effect Balance was used to 
probe the space between the poles. 
If you’ve never seen an M-E Bal- 
ance in action, it consists primarily 
of a tight monochromatic beam of 
gamma rays shot down the low-gravi- 
ty field. The gamma rays change 
wavelength slightly but measurably 
under the influence of the gravita- 
tional field and if anything happens 
to alter the intensity of the field, the 
wavelength-change shifts correspond- 
ingly. It is an extremely delicate 
method for probing a gravitational 
field, and it worked like a charm. 
There was no question but that 
Bloom had lowered gravity. 

The trouble was that it had been 
done before by others. Bloom, to be 
sure, had made use of circuits that 
greatly increased the ease with which 
such an effect had been achieved 
(his system was typically ingenious 
and had been duly patented), and he 
maintained that it was by this meth- 
od that anti-gravity would become 
not merely a scientific curiosity but 
a practical affair with industrial ap- 
plications. 

Perhaps! But it was an incomplete 
job, and he didn’t usually make 
a fuss over incompleteness. He 
wouldn’t have done so this time if he 
didn’t have to display something . 

I said, “It’s my impression that 
what you accomplished at that pre- 
liminary demonstration was 0.82 g, 
and better than that was achieved in 
Brazil last spring.” 


“That so? Well, calculate the 
energy input in Brazil and here and 
then tell me the difference in gravity 
decrease per kilowatt-hour. You’ll be 
surprised.” 

“But the point is, can you reach 

0 g; zero gravity? That’s wihat Pro- 
fessor Priss thinks may be impossi- 
ble. Everyone agrees that merely 
lessening the intensity of the field is 
no great feat.” 

Bloom’s fist clenched. I had the 
feeling that a key experiment had 
gone wrong that day and he was an- 
noyed almost past endurance. Bloom 
hated to be balked by the universe. 

He said, “Theoreticians make me 
sick.” He said it in a low, controlled 
voice, as though he were finally tired 
of not saying it, and he was going to 
speak his mind and be damned. 
“Priss has won two Nobel Prizes for 
sloshing around a few equations, but 
what has he done with it? Nothing! I 
have done something with it and I’m 
going to do more with it, whether 
Priss likes it or not. 

“/'ra the one people will remem- 
ber. I’m the one who gets the credit. 
He can keep his damned title and 
his Prizes and his kudos from the 
scholars. Listen, I’ll tell you what 
gripes him. Plain old-fashioned 
jealousy. It kills him that I get what 

1 get for doing. He wants it for 
thinking. 

“I said to him once — We play 
billiards together, you know — ” 

(It was at this point that I quoted 
Priss’s statement about billiards and 
got Bloom’s counterstatement. I 
never published either. That was just 
trivia.) 

“We play billiards,” said Bloom, 

13 


THE BILLIARD BALL 




when he had cooled down, “and I’ve 
won my share of games. We keep 
things friendly enough, what the hell 
— college chums and all that — 
though how he got through I’ll never 
know. He made it in physics, of 
course, and in math. But he got a 
bare pass — out of pity, I think — 
in every humanities course he ever 
took.” 

“You did not get your degree, did 
you, Mr. Bloom?” (That was sheer 
mischief on my part. I was enjoying 
his eruption.) 

“I quit to go into business, damn 
it! My academic average, over the 
three years I attended, was a strong 
B. Don’t imagine anything else, you 
hear? Hell, by the time Priss got his 
Pfa.D., I was working on my second 
million.” 

He went on, clearly irritated. 


“Anyway, we were playing billiards, 
and I said to him, ‘Jim, the average 
man will never understand why you 
get the Nobel Prize when I’m the 
one who gets the results. Why do you 
need two? Give me one!’ He stood 
there, chalking up his cue, and then 
he said in his soft namby-pamby 
way, ‘You have two billion, Ed. 
Give me one.’ So you see, he wants 
the money.” 

I said, “I take it you don’t mind 
his getting the honor?” 

For a minute, I thought he was go- 
ing to order me out. But he didn’t. 
He laughed instead, waved his hand 
in front of him, as though he were 
erasing something from an invisible 
blackboard in front of him. He said, 
“Oh, well, forget it. All that is off 
the record. Listen, do you want a 
statement? Okay! Things didn’t go 
right today, and I blew my top a bit, 
but it will clear up. I think I know 
what’s wrong. And if I don’t, I’m go- 
ing to know. 

“Look, you can say that / say that 
we don't need infinite electromag- 
netic intensity. We will flatten out 
the rubber sheet. We will have zero 
gravity. And when we get it, I’ll 
have the damnedest demonstration 
you ever saw, exclusively for the 
press and for Priss, and you’ll be in- 
vited. And you can say it won’t be 
long. Okay?” 

Okay! 

I had time after that to see each 
man once or twice more. I even 
saw them together when I was pres- 
ent at one of their billiard games. 
As I said before, both of them were 
good.

IF 


But the call to the demonstration 
did not come as quickly as all that. It 
arrived six weeks less than a year 
after Bloom gave me his statement. 

And at that, perhaps it was unfair 
to expect quicker work. 

I had a special engraved invitation, 
with the assurance of a cocktail hour 
first. Bloom never did things by 
halves, and he was planning to have 
a pleased and satisfied group of re- 
porters on hand. There was an ar- 
rangement for tridimensional TV, 
too. Bloom felt completely confident, 
obviously; confident enough to be 
willing to trust the demonstration in 
every living room on the planet. 

I called up Professor Priss, to 
make sure he was invited, too. He 
was! 

“Do you plan to attend, sir?” 
There was a pause, and the pro- 
fessor’s face on the screen was a 
study in uncertain reluctance. “A 
demonstration of this sort is most 
unsuitable where a serious scientific 
matter is in question. I do not like 
to encourage such things.” 

I was afraid he would beg off, 
and the dramatics of the situation 
would be greatly lessened if he were 
not there. But then, perhaps, he de- 
cided he dared not play the chicken 
before the world. With obvious dis- 
taste, he said, “Of course, Ed Bloom 
is not really a scientist, and he must 
have his day in the sun. I’ll be there.” 
“Do you think Mr. Bloom can 
produce zero gravity, sir?” 

“ — uh — Mr. Bloom sent me a 
copy of the design of his device and 
— and I’m not certain. Perhaps he 
can do it, if — uh — he says he 
can do it. Of course — ” he paused 


again for quite a long time. “I think 
I would like to see it.” 

So would I, and so would many 
others. 

The staging was impeccable. A 
whole floor of the main building at 
Bloom Enterprises — the one on 
the hilltop — was cleared. There 
were the promised cocktails and a 
splendid array of hors d’oeuvres, soft 
music and lighting, and a carefully 
dressed and thoroughly jovial Ed- 
ward Bloom playing the perfect host, 
while a number of polite and un- 
obtrusive menials fetched and car- 
ried. All was geniality and amazing 
confidence. 

James Priss was late, and I caught 
Bloom watching the corners of the 
crowd and beginning to grow a little 
grim about the edges. Then Priss 
arrived, dragging a volume of color-

lessness in with him, a drabness that 
was unaffected by the noise and the 
absolute splendor (no other word 
would describe it — or else it was 
the two martinis glowing inside me) 
that filled the room. 

Bloom saw him, and his face was. 
illuminated at once. He bounced 
across the floor, seizing the smaller 
man’s hand and dragging him to the 
bar. 

“Jim! Glad to see you! What’ll 
you have? Hell, man, I’d have called 
it off if you hadn’t showed. Can’t 
have this thing without the star, you 
know.” He wrung Priss’s hand. “It’s 
your theory, you know. We poor 
mortals can’t do a thing without you 
few, you damned few few, pointing 
the way.” 

He was being ebullient, handing 
out the flattery, because he could af- 
ford to do so now. He was fattening 
Priss for the kill. 

Priss tried to refuse a drink, with 
some sort of mutter, but a glass was 
pressed into his hand; and Bloom 
raised his voice to a bullroar. 

“Gentlemen! A moment’s quiet, 
please. To Professor Priss, the 
greatest mind since Einstein, two- 
time Nobel Laureate, father of the 
Two-Field Theory, and inspirer of the 
demonstration we are about to see 
— even if he didn’t think it would 
work and he had the guts to say so 
publicly.” 

There was a distinct titter of laugh- 
ter that quickly faded out, and Priss 
looked as grim as he could manage. 

“But now that Professor Priss is 
here,” said Bloom, “and we’ve had 
our toast, let’s get on with it. Fol- 
low me, gentlemen!” 


T he demonstration was in a much 
more elaborate place than had 
housed the earlier one. This time it 
was on the top floor of the building. 
Different magnets were involved — 
smaller ones, by heaven — but as 
nearly as I could tell, the same M-E 
Balance was in place. 

One thing was new, however, and 
it staggered everybody, drawing 
much more attention than anything 
else in the room. It was a billiard 
table, resting under one pole of the 
magnet. Beneath it was the compan- 
ion pole. A round hole about a foot 
across was stamped out of the very 
center of the table; and it was ob- 
vious that the zero-gravity field, if it 
was to be produced, would be pro- 
duced through that hole in the center 
of the billiard table. 

It was as though the whole dem- 
onstration had been designed, sur- 
realist-fashion, to point up the vic- 
tory of Bloom over Priss. This was 
to be another version of their ever- 
lasting billiards competition, and 
Bloom was going to win. 

I don’t know if the other newsmen 
took matters in that fashion, but I 
think Priss did. I turned to look at 
him and saw that he was still hold- 
ing the drink that had been forced 
into his hand. He rarely drank, I 
knew, but now he lifted the glass to 
his lips and emptied it in two swal- 
lows. He stared at that billiard ball, 
and I needed no gift of ESP to re- 
alize that he took it as a deliberate 
snap of fingers under his nose. 

Bloom led us to the twenty seats 
that surrounded three sides of the 


( 


16 


IF 



table, leaving the fourth free as a 
working area. Priss was carefully es- 
corted to the seat commanding the 
most convenient view. Priss glanced 
quickly at the tri-di cameras which 
were now working. I wondered if he 
were thinking of leaving but decid- 
ing that he couldn’t in the full glare 
of the eyes of the world. 

Essentially, the demonstration was 
simple; it was the production that 
counted. There were dials in plain 
view that measured the energy ex- 
penditure. There were others that 
transferred the M-E Balance readings 
into a position and a size that were 
visible to all. Everything was ar- 
ranged for easy tri-di viewing. 

Bloom explained each step in a 
genial way, with one or two pauses 
in which he turned to Priss for a con- 
firmation that had to come. He didn’t 
do it often enough to make it ob- 
vious, but just enough to turn Priss 
upon the spit of his own torment. 
From where I sat I could look across 
the table and see Priss on the other 
side. 

He had the look of a man in Hell. 

A s we all know, Bloom succeeded. 

The M-E Balance showed the 
gravitational intensity to be sinking 
steadily as the electromagnetic field 
was intensified. There were cheers, 
when it dropped below the 0.52 g 
mark. A red line indicated that on 
the dial. 

“The 0.52 g mark, as you know,” 
said Bloom, confidently, “represents 
the previous record low in gravita- 
tional intensity. We are now lower 
than that at a cost in electricity that 
is less than ten per cent what it cost 


at the time that mark was set. And 
we will go lower still.” 

Bloom (I think deliberately, for 
the sake of the suspense) slowed the 
drop toward the end, letting the tri- 
di cameras switch back and forth be- 
tween the gap in the billiard table 
and the dial on which the M-E Bal- 
ance reading was lowering. 

Bloom said, suddenly, “Gentle- 
men, you will find dark goggles in 
the pouch on the side of each chair. 
Please put them on now. The zero- 
gravity field will soon be established, 
and it will radiate a light rich in ul- 
traviolet.” 

He put goggles on himself, and 
there was a momentary rustle as oth- 
ers went on, too. 

I think no one breathed during 
the last minute, when the dial read- 
ing dropped to zero and held fast. 
And just as that happened a cylinder 
of light sprang into existence from 
pole to pole through the hole in the 
billiard table. 

There was a ghost of twenty sighs 
at that. Someone called out, “Mr. 
Bloom, what is the reason for the 
light?” 

“It’s characteristic of the zero- 
gravity field,” said Bloom smoothly, 
which was no answer of course. 

Reporters were standing up now, 
crowding about the edge of the ta- 
ble. Bloom waved them back. 
“Please, gentlemen, stand clear!” 

Only Priss remained sitting. He 
seemed lost in thought, and I have 
been certain ever since that it was 
the goggles that obscured the possi- 
ble significance of everything that 
followed. I didn’t see his eyes. I 
couldn’t. And that meant neither I 


THE BILLIARD BALL 


17 



nor anyone else could even begin to 
make a guess as to what was going 
on behind those eyes. 

Well, maybe we couldn’t have 
made such a guess, even if the 
goggles hadn’t been there, but who 
can say? 

Bloom was raising his voice again. 
“Please! The demonstration is not 
yet over. So far, we’ve only repeated 
what I have done before,. I have now 
produced a zero-gravity field and I 
have shown it can be done practical- 
ly. But I want to demonstrate some- 
thing of what such a field can do. 
What we are going to see next will 
be something that has never been 
seen, not even by myself. I have not 
experimented in this direction, much 
as I would have liked to, because I 
have felt that Professor Priss deserv- 
ed the honor of — ” 

Priss looked up sharply, “What — 
what — ” 

“Professor Priss,” said Bloom, 
smiling broadly, “I would like you to 
perform the first experiment involv- 
ing the interaction of a solid object 
with a zero-gravity field. Notice that 
the field has been formed in the cen- 
ter of a billiard table. The world 
knows your phenomenal skill in bil- 
liards, Professor, a talent second only 
to your amazing aptitude in theore- 
tical physics. Won’t you send a bil- 
liard ball into the zero-gravity 
volume?” 

E agerly, he was handing a ball and 
cue to the professor. Priss, his 
eyes hidden by the goggles, stared at 
them and only very slowly, very un- 
certainly, reached out to take them. 
I wonder what his eyes were show- 


ing. I wonder, too, how much of the 
decision to have Priss play billiards 
at the demonstration was due to 
Bloom’s anger at Priss’s remark 
about their periodic game, the re- 
mark I had quoted. Had I been, in 
my way, responsible for what follow- 
ed? 

“Come, stand up, Professor,” said 
Bloom, “and let me have your seat. 
The show is yours from now on. Go 
ahead!” 

Bloom seated himself and still 
talked, in a voice that grew more 
organlike with each moment. “Once 
Professor Priss sends the ball into the 
volume of zero-gravity, it will no 
longer be affected by Earth’s gravi- 
tational field. It will remain truly 
motionless while the Earth rotates 
about its axis and travels about the 
sun. In this latitude, and at this time 
of day, I have calculated that the 
Earth, in its motions, will sink down- 
ward. We will move with it, and the 
ball will stand still. To us it will seem 
to rise up and away from the Earth’s 
surface. Watch.” 

Priss seemed to stand in front of 
the table in frozen paralysis. Was it 
surprise? Astonishment? I don’t 
know. I’ll never know. Did he make 
a move to interrupt Bloom’s little 
speech, or was he just suffering from 
an agonized reluctance to play the 
ignominious part into which he was 
being forced by his adversary? 

Priss turned to the billiard table, 
looking first at it, then back at 
Bloom. Every reporter was on his 
feet, crowding as closely as possible 
in order to get a good view. Only 
Bloom himself remained seated, smil- 
ing and isolated. (He, of course, was 


18 


IF 



not watching the table, or the balls, 
or the zero-gravity field. As nearly 
as I could tell through the goggles, 
he was watching Priss.) 

Priss turned to the table and 
placed his ball. He was going to be 
the agent that was to bring final and 
dramatic triumph to Bloom and 
make himself — the man who said 
it couldn’t be done — the goat to 
be mocked forever. 

Perhaps he felt there was no way 
out. Or perhaps — 

With a sure stroke of his cue, he 
set the ball into motion. It was not 
going quickly, and every eye follow- 
ed it. It struck the side of the table 
and caromed. It was going even 
slower now as though Priss himself 
were increasing the suspense and 
making Bloom’s triumph the more 
dramatic. 

I had a perfect view, for I was 
standing on the side of the table op- 
posite from that where Priss was. I 
could see the ball moving toward 
the glitter of the zero-gravity field, 
and beyond it I could see those por- 
tions of the seated Bloom which 
were not hidden by that glitter. 

The ball approached the zero- 
gravity volume, seemed to hang on 
the edge for a moment and then was 
gone, with a streak of light, the 
sound of a thunder-clap and the sud- 
den smell of burning cloth. 

We yelled. We all yelled. 

I’ve seen the scene on television 
since — along with the rest of the 
world. I can see myself in the film 
during that fifteen second period of 
wild confusion, but I don’t really 
recognize my face. 

Fifteen seconds! 


And then we discovered Bloom. 
He was still sitting in the chair, his 
arms still folded — but there was a 
hole the size of a billiard ball 
through left wrist, chest and back. 
The better part of his heart, as it 
later turned out under autopsy, had 
been neatly punched out.’ 

They turned off the device. They 
called in the police. They dragged 
off Priss, who was in a state of utter 
collapse. I wasn’t much better off, to 
tell the truth, and if any reporter 
then on the scene ever tried to say he 
remained a cool observer of that 
scene, then he’s a cool liar. 

V 

I t was some months before I got 
to see Priss again. He had lost 
some weight but seemed well other- 
wise, Indeed, there was color in his 
cheeks and an air of decision about 
him. He was better dressed than I 
had ever seen him to be. 

He said, “I know what happened 
now, If I had had time to think, I 
would have known then. But I am a 
slow thinker, and poor Ed Bloom was 
so intent on running a great show 
and doing it so well that he carried 
me along with him. Naturally, I’ve 
been trying to make up for some of 
the damage I unwittingly caused.” 
“You can’t bring Bloom back to 
life,” I said, soberly. 

“No, I can’t,” he said, just as 
soberly. “But there’s Bloom Enter- 
prises to think of, too. What hap- 
pened at the demonstration, in full 
view of the world, was the worst 
possible advertisement for zero-gravi- 
ty, and it’s important that the story 


THE BILLIARD BALL 


19 



be made clear. That is why l have 
asked to see you." 

“Yes?” 

“If I had been a quicker thinker, 
I would have known Ed was speak- 
ing the purest nonsense, when he 
said that the billiard ball would slow- 
ly rise in the zero-gravity field. It 
couldn't be so! If Bloom hadn’t des- 
pised theory so, if he hadn’t been so 
intent on being proud of his own 
ignorance of theory, he’d have 
known it himself. 

“The Earth’s motion, after all, 
isn’t the only motion involved, 
young man. The sun itself moves in 
a vast orbit about the center of the 
Milky Way galaxy. And the galaxy 
moves, too, in some not very clear- 
ly defined way. If the billiard ball 
were subjected to zero gravity, you 
might think of it as being unaffected 
by any of these motions and there- 
fore of suddenly falling into a state 
of absolute rest — when there is no 
such thing as absolute rest.” 

Priss shook his head slowly. “The 
trouble with Ed, I think, was that 
he was thinking of the kind of zero- 
gravity one gets in a spaceship in 
free fall, when people float in mid- 
air. He expected the ball to float in 
mid-air. However, in a spaceship, 
zero gravity is not the result of an 
absence of gravitation, but merely 
the result of two objects, a ship and 
a man within the ship, falling at the 
same rate, responding to gravity in 
precisely the same way, so that each 
is motionless with respect to the oth- 
er. 

“In the zero-gravity field pro- 
duced by Ed, there was a flattening 
of the rubber-sheet universe, which 


means an actual loss of mass. 
Everything in that field, including 
molecules of air caught within it, and 
the billiard ball I pushed into it, was 
completely massless as long as it re- 
mained with it. A completely mass- 
less object can move in only one 
way.” 

He paused, inviting the question. 
I asked, “What motion would that 
be?” 

“Motion at the speed of light. Any 
massless object, such as a neutrino 
or a photon, must travel at the speed 
of light as long as it exists. In fact, 
light moves at that speed only be- 
cause it is made up of photons. As 
soon as the billiard ball entered the 
zero-gravity field and lost its mass, 
it, too, assumed the speed of light 
at once and left.” 

I shook my head. “But didn’t it re- 
gain its mass as soon as it left 
the zero-gravity volume?” 

“It certainly did, and at once it 
began to be affected by the gravita- 
tional field and to slow up in re- 
sponse to the friction of the air and 
the top of the billiard table. But 
imagine how much friction it would 
take to slow up an object the mass of 
a billiard ball going at the speed of 
light. It went through the hundred- 
mile thickness of our atmosphere in 
a thousandth of a second, and I doubt 
that it was slowed more than a few 
miles a second in doing so; a few 
miles out of 186,282 of them. On the 
way, it scorched the top of the bil- 
liard table, broke cleanly through 
the edge, went through poor Ed and 
the window too, punching out neat 
circles, because it had passed

splinter. Priss shrugged. “It came from 

“It is extremely fortunate we were nowhere! The law of conservation of

“The molecules of air inside the 
volume! Each assumes the speed of 
light and comes smashing outward. 
They’re only molecules, not billiard 
balls, so they’re stopped, but the 
kinetic energy of their motion is con- 
verted into energetic radiation. It’s 
continuous because new molecules 
are always drifting in and attaining 
the speed of light and smashing out.” 

“Then energy is being created 
continuously?” 

“Exactly. And that is what we 
must make clear to the public. Anti- 
gravity is not primarily a device to 
lift spaceships or to revolutionize 
mechanical movement. Rather it is 
the source of an endless supply of 
free energy, since part of the energy 
produced can be diverted to maintain 
the field that keeps that portion of 
the universe flat. What Ed Bloom 
invented, without knowing it, was 
not just anti-gravity, but the first 
successful perpetual motion machine 
of the first class — one that manu- 
factures energy out of nothing.” 

I said, slowly, “Any one of us 
could have been killed by that billi- 
ard ball, is that right, professor? It 
might have come out in any direc- 
tion.” 

Priss said, “Well, massless photons 
emerge from any light source at the 
speed of light in any direction; that’s 
why a candle casts light in all direc- 
tions. The massless air molecules 
come out of the zero-gravity volume 
in all directions, which is why the 
entire cylinder radiates. But the billi- 
ard ball was only one object. It 
could have come out in any direc- 
tion, but it had to come out in some 
one direction, chosen at random, and 


the chosen direction happened to be 
the one that caught Ed.” 

T hat was it. Everyone knows the 
consequences. Mankind had free 
energy and so we have the world we 
have now. Professor Priss was placed 
in charge of its development by the 
board of Bloom Enterprises, and in 
time he was as rich and famous as 
ever Edward Bloom had been. And 
Priss still has two Nobel Prizes in 
addition. 

Only — 

I keep thinking. Photons smash out 
from a light source in all directions 
because they are created at the mo- 
ment and there is no reason for them 
to move in one direction more than 
in another. Air molecules come out 
of a zero-gravity field in all direc- 
tions because they enter it in all di- 
rections. 

But what about a single billiard 
ball, entering a zero-gravity field 
from one particular direction. Does 
it come out in the same direction or 
in any direction? 

I’ve inquired delicately, but theore- 
tical physicists don’t seem to be sure, 
and I can find no record that Bloom 
Enterprises, which is the only organi- 
zation working with zero-gravity 
fields, has ever experimented in the 
matter. Someone at the organiza- 
tion once told me that the uncer- 
tainty principle guarantees the ran- 
dom emergence of an object entering 
in any direction. But then why don’t 
they try the experiment? 

Could it be, then — 

Could it be that for once Priss’s 
mind had been working quickly? 
Could it be that, under the pressure

of what Bloom was trying to do to 
him, Priss had suddenly seen every- 
thing. He had been studying the ra- 
diation surrounding the zero-gravity 
volume. He might have realized its 
cause and been certain of the speed- 
of-light motion of anything entering 
the volume. 

Why, then, had he said nothing? 

One thing is certain. Nothing 
Priss would do at the billiard table 
could be accidental. He was an ex- 
pert and the billiard balls did exactly 
what he wanted them to. I was stand- 
ing right there. I saw him look at 


Bloom and then at the table as 
though he were judging angles. 

I watched him hit that ball. I 
watched it bounce off the side of the 
table and move into the zero-gravity 
volume, heading in one particular 
direction. 

For when Priss sent that ball 
toward the zero-gravity volume — 
and the tri-di films bear me out — 
it was already aimed directly at 
Bloom’s heart! 

Accident? Coincidence? 

Murder?

There were no words. I stared 
and I stared, and I cursed the fact 
that the thing existed and that some- 
one had found it while I was still 
around. 


“Well?” said Lanning, and he 
banked the flier so that I could 
look upward. 

I shook my head and shaded my 
already shielded eyes. 

“Make it go away,” I finally told 
him. 

“Can’t. It’s bigger than I am.” 

“It’s bigger than anybody,” I said. 

“I can make us go away ...”

“Never mind. I want to take 
some pictures.” 

He brought it around, and I 
started to shoot. 

“Can you hover — or get any 
closer?” 

“No, the winds are too strong.” 

“That figures.” 

So I shot — through telescopic 
lenses and scan attachment and all 
— as we circled it. 

“I’d give a lot to see the top.” 

“We’re at thirty thousand feet, 
and fifty’s the ceiling on this baby. 
The Lady, unfortunately, stands 
taller than the atmosphere.” 

“Funny,” I said, “from here she 
doesn’t strike me as the sort to 
breathe ether and spend all her time 
looking at stars.” 

He chuckled and lit a cigarette, 
and I reached us another bulb of 
coffee. 

“How does the Gray Sister strike 
you?” 

And I lit one of my own and in- 
haled, as the flier was buffeted by 
sudden gusts of something from 
somewhere and then ignored, and I 
said, “Like Our Lady of the Abat- 
toir — right between the eyes.” 

We drank some coffee, and then 
he asked, “She too big, Whitey?” 
and I gnashed my teeth through caf- 
feine, for only my friends call me 
Whitey, my name being Jack Sum- 
mers and my hair having always 
been this way, and at the moment I 
wasn’t too certain whether Henry 
Lanning qualified for that status 
— just because he’d known me for 
twenty years — after going out of 
his way to find this thing on a world 
with a thin atmosphere, a lot of 


rocks, a too-bright sky and a name 
like LSD pronounced backwards, 
after George Diesel, who had set 
foot in the dust and then gone away 
— smart fellow! 

“A forty-mile-high mountain,” I 
finally said, “is not a mountain. 
It is a world all by itself, which 
some dumb deity forgot to throw 
into orbit.” 

“I take it you’re not interested?” 

I looked back at the gray and 
lavender slopes and followed them 
upward once again, until all color 
drained away, until the silhouette 
was black and jagged and the top 
still nowhere in sight, until my 
eyes stung and burned behind their 
protective glasses; and I saw clouds 
bumping up against that invincible 
outline, like icebergs in the sky, and 
I heard the howling of the retreating 
winds which had essayed to measure 
its grandeur with swiftness and, of 
course, had failed. 

“Oh, I’m interested,” I said, “in 
an academic sort of way. Let’s go 
back to town, where I can eat and 
drink and maybe break a leg if I’m 
lucky.” 

He headed the flier south, and 
I didn’t look around as we went. I 
could sense her presence at my 
back, though, all the way: The Gray 
Sister, the highest mountain in the 
known universe. Unclimbed, of 
course. 

S he remained at my back during 
the days that followed, casting 
her shadow over everything I looked 
upon. For the next two days I 
studied the pictures I had taken and 
I dug up some maps and I studied 


38 


IF 



them, too; and I spoke with people 
who told me stories of the Gray 
Sister, strange stories. 

During this time, I came across 
nothing really encouraging. I learned 
that there had been an attempt to 
colonize Diesel a couple centuries 
previously, back before faster-than- 
light ships were developed. A brand- 
new disease had colonized the first 
colonists, however, wiping them out 
to a man. The new colony was four 
years old, had better doctors, had 
beaten the plague, was on Diesel to 
stay and seemed proud of its poor 
taste when it came to worlds. No- 
body, I learned, fooled around much 
with the Gray Sister. There had been 
a few abortive attempts to climb 
her, and some young legends that 
followed after. 

During the day, the sky never 
shut up. It kept screaming into my 
eyes, until I took to wearing my 
climbing goggles whenever I went 
out. Mainly, though, I sat in the 
hotel lounge and ate and drank and 
studied the pictures and cross- 
examined anybody who happened to 
pass by and glance at them, spread 
out there on the table. 

I continued to ignore all Henry’s 
questions. I knew what he wanted, 
and he could damn well wait. Un- 
fortunately, he did, and rather well, 
too, which irritated me. He felt I 
was almost hooked by the Sister, 
and he wanted to Be There When It 
Happened. He’d made a fortune on 
the Kasla story, and I could already 
see the opening sentences of this 
one in the smug lines around his 
eyes. Whenever he tried to make 
like a poker player, leaning on his 


fist and slowly turning a photo, I 
could see whole paragraphs. If I 
followed the direction of his gaze, 
I probably could even have seen the 
dust jacket. 

At the end of the week, a ship 
came' down out of the sky, and some 
nasty people got off and interrupted 
my train of thought. When they 
came into the lounge, I recognized 
them for what they were and re- 
moved my black lenses so that I 
could nail Henry with my basilisk 
gaze and turn him to stone. As it 
would happen, he had too much 
alcohol in him, and it didn’t work. 

“You tipped off the press,” I said. 

“Now, now,” he said, growing 
smaller and stiffening as my gaze 
groped its way through the murk 
of his central nervous system and 
finally touched upon the edges of 
that tiny tumor, his forebrain. 
“You’re well-known, and. ...” 

I replaced my glasses and hunched 
over my drink, looking far gone, as 
one of the three approached and 
said, “Pardon me, but are you Jack 
Summers?” 

T o explain the silence which fol- 
lowed, Henry said, “Yes, this 
is Mad Jack, the man who climbed 
Everest at twenty-three and every 
other pile of rocks worth mentioning 
since that time. At thirty-one, he 
became the only man to conquer the 
highest mountain in the known uni- 
verse — Mount Kasla on Litan — 
elevation 89,941 feet. My book — ” 
“Yes,” said the reporter. “My 
name is Cary, and I’m with GP. My 
friends represent two of the other 
syndicates. We’ve heard that you 


THIS MORTAL MOUNTAIN 


39 



are going to climb the Gray Sister.” 

“You’ve heard incorrectly,” I said. 

“Oh?” 

The other two came up and stood 
beside 'him. 

“We thought that — ” one of 
them began. 

“ — you were already organizing 
a climbing party,” said the other. 

“Then you’re not going to climb 
the Sister?” asked Cary, while one 
of the two looked over my pictures 
and the other got ready to take 
some of his own. 

“Stop that!” I said, raising a hand 
at the photographer. “Bright lights 
hurt my eyes!” 

“Sorry. I’ll use the infra,” he said, 
and he started fooling with his 
camera. 

Cary repeated the question. 

“All I said was that you’ve heard 
incorrectly,” I told him. “I didn’t 
say I was and I didn’t say I wasn’t. 
I haven't made up my mind.” 

“If you should decide to try it, 
have you any idea when it will be?” 

“Sorry, I can’t answer that.” 

Henry took the three of them over 
to the bar and started explaining 
something, with gestures. I heard the 
words “ . out of retirement after 
four years,” and when/ if they looked 
to the booth again, I was gone. 

I had retired, to the street which 
was full of dusk, and I walked along 
it thinking. I trod her shadow even 
then, Linda. And the Gray Sister 
beckoned and forbade with her sin- 
gle unmoving gesture. I watched her, 
so far away, yet still so large, a 
piece of midnight at eight o’clock. 
The hours that lay between died like 
the distance at her feet, and I knew 


that she would follow me wherever 
I went, even into sleep. Especially 
into sleep. 

So I knew, at that moment. The 
days that followed were a game I 
enjoyed playing. Fake indecision is 
delicious when people want you to 
do something. I looked at her then, 
my last and my largest, my very own 
Koshtra Pivrarcha, and I felt that I 
was born to stand upon her summit. 
Then I could retire, probably re- 
marry, cultivate my mind, not worry 
about getting out of shape, and do 
all the square things I didn’t do be- 
fore, the lack of which had cost me 
a wife and a home, back when I 
had gone to Kasla, elevation 89,941 
feet, four and a half years ago, in 
the days of my glory. I regarded my 
Gray Sister across the eight o’clock 
world, and she was dark and noble 
and still and waiting, as she had 
alwas been. 

II 

T he following morning I sent the 
messages. Out across the light- 
years like cosmic carrier pigeons 
they went. They winged their ways 
to some persons I hadn’t seen in 
years and to others who had seen 
me off at Luna Station. Each said, in 
its own way, “If you want in on the 
biggest climb of them all, come to 
Diesel. The Gray Sister eats Kaslas 
for breakfast. R.S.V.P. c/o The 
Lodge, Georgetown. Whitey.” 
Backward, turn backward . 
I didn’t tell Henry. Nothing at all. 
What I had done and where I was 
going, for a time, were my business 
only, for that same time. I checked 


40 


IF 



out well before sunrise and left him 
a message at the desk: 

“Out of town on business. Back 
in a week. Hold the fort. Mad Jack.” 

I had to gauge the lower slopes, 
tug the hem of the lady’s skirt, so 
to speak, before I introduced her to 
my friends. They say only a madman 
climbs alone, but they call me what 
they call me for a reason. 

From my pix, the northern face 
had looked promising. 

I set the rented flier down as 
near as I could, locked it up, 
shouldered my pack and started 
walking. 

Mountains rising to my right and 
to my left, mountains at my back, 
all dark as sin now in the predawn 
light of a white, white day. Ahead 
of me, not a mountain, but an al- 
most gentle slope which kept rising 
and rising and rising. Bright stars 
above me and cold wind past me 
as I walked. Straight up, though, no 
stars, just black. I wondered for the 
thousandth time what a mountain 
weighed. I always wonder that as I 
approach one. No clouds in sight. 
No noises but my boot sounds on the 
turf and the small gravel. My goggles 
flopped around my neck. My hands 
were moist within my gloves. On 
Diesel, the pack and I together prob- 
ably weighed about the same as me 
alone on Earth — for which I was 
duly grateful. My breath burned as 
it came and steamed as it went. I 
counted a thousand steps and looked 
back, and I couldn’t see the flier. I 
counted a thousand more and then 
looked up to watch some stars go 
out. About an hour after that, I had 
to put on my goggles. By then I 


could see where I was headed. And 
by then the wind seemed stronger. 

She was so big that the eye 
couldn’t take all of her in at once. I 
moved my head from side to side, 
leaning further and further back- 
ward. Wherever the top, it was too 
high. For an instant, I was seized by 
a crazy acrophobic notion that I was 
looking down rather than up, and 
the soles of my feet and the palms of 
my hands tingled, like an ape’s must 
when, releasing one high branch to 
seize another, he discovers that there 
isn’t another. 

I went on for two more hours and 
stopped for a light meal. This was 
hiking, not climbing. As I ate, I 
wondered what could have caused a 
formation like the Gray Sister. There 
were some ten and twelve-mile peaks 
within sixty miles of the place and 
a fifteen-mile mountain called Bur- 
ke’s Peak on the adjacent continent, 
but nothing else like the Sister. The 
lesser gravitation? Her composition? 
I couldn’t say. I wondered what Doc 
and Kelly and Mallard i would say 
when they saw her. 

I don’t define them, though. I 
only climb them. 

I looked up again, and a few 
clouds were brushing against her 
now. From the photos I had taken, 
she might be an easy ascent for a 
good ten or twelve miles. Like a big 
hill. There were certainly enough 
alternate routes. In fact, I thought 
she just might be a pushover. Feel- 
ing heartened, I repacked my uten- 
sils and proceeded. It was going to 
be a good day, I could tell. 

And it was. I got off the slope 
and onto something like a trail by 


THIS MORTAL MOUNTAIN 


41 



late afternoon. Daylight lasts about 
nine hours on Diesel, and I spent 
most of it moving. The trail was so 
good that I kept on for several hours 
after sundown and made consider- 
able height. I was beginning to use 
my respiration equipment by then, 
and the heating unit in my suit was 
turned on. 

The stars were big, brilliant flow- 
ers, the way was easy, the night 
was my friend. I came upon a broad, 
flat piece and made my camp under 
an overhang. 

There I slept, and I dreamt of 
snowy women with breasts like the 
Alps, pinked by the morning sun; 
and they sang to me like the wind 
and laughed, had eyes of ice pris- 
matic. They fled through a field of 
clouds. 

T he following day I made a lot 
more height. The “trail” began 
to narrow, and it ran out in places, 
but it was easy to reach for the sky 
until another one occurred. So far, 
it had all been good rock. It was still 
tapering as it heightened, and 
balance was no problem. I did a lot 
of plain old walking. I ran up one 
long zigzag and hit it up a wide 
chimney almost as fast as Santa 
Claus comes down one. The winds 
were strong, could be a problem if 
the going got difficult. I was on the 
respirator full time and feeling great. 

I could see for an enormous dis- 
tance now. There were mountains 
and mountains, all below me like 
desert dunes. The sun beat halos of 
heat about their peaks. In the east, 
I saw Lake Emerick, dark and shiny 
as the toe of a boot. I wound my 


way about a jutting crag and came 
upon a giant’s staircase, going up for 
at least a thousand feet. I mounted 
it. At its top I hit my first real bar- 
rier: a fairly smooth, almost perpen- 
dicular face rising for about eighty- 
five feet. 

No way around it, so I went up. 
It took me a good hour, and there 
was a ridge at the top leading to 
more easy climbing. By then, though, 
the clouds attacked me. Even though 
the going was easy, I was slowed by 
the fog. I wanted to outclimb it and 
still have some daylight left, so I 
decided to postpone eating. 

But the clouds kept coming. I 
made another thousand feet, and they 
were still about me. Somewhere be- 
low me, I heard thunder. The fog 
was easy on my eyes, though, so I 
kept pushing. 

Then I tried a chimney, the top 
of which I could barely discern, be- 
cause it looked a lot shorter than 
a jagged crescent to its left. This 
was a mistake. 

The rate of condensation was 
greater than I’d guessed. The walls 
were slippery. I’m stubborn, though, 
and I fought with skidding boots and 
moist back until I was about a third 
of the way up, I thought, and winded. 

I realized then what I had done. 
What I had thought was the top 
wasn’t. I went another fifteen feet 
and wished I hadn’t. The fog began 
to boil about me, and I suddenly felt 
drenched. I was afraid to go down 
and I was afraid to go up, and I 
couldn’t stay where I was forever. 

Whenever you hear a person say 
that he inched along, do not accuse 
him of a fuzzy choice of verbs. Give 


42 


IF 



him the benefit of the doubt and 
your sympathy. 

I inched my way, blind, up an 
unknown length of slippery chimney. 
If my hair hadn’t already been white 
when I entered at the bottom . 

Finally, I got above the fog. Fin- 
ally, I saw a piece of that bright and 
nasty sky, which I decided to forgive 
for the moment. I aimed at it, ar- 
rived on target. 

When I emerged, I saw a little 
ledge about ten feet above me. I 
climbed to it and stretched out. My 
muscles were a bit shaky, and I made 
them go liquid. I took a drink of 
water, ate a couple of chocolate bars, 
took another drink. 

After perhaps ten minutes, I stood 
up. I could no longer see the ground. 
Just the soft, white cottony top of a 
kindly old storm. I looked up. 

It was amazing. She was still top- 
less. And save for a couple spots, 
such as the last — which had been 
the fault of my own stupid overcon- 
fidence — it had almost been as 
easy as climbing stairs. 

Now the going appeared to be 
somewhat rougher, however. This 
was what I had really come to test. 

I swung my pick and continued. 

A ll the following day I climbed, 
steadily, taking no unnecessary 
risks, resting periodically, drawing 
maps, taking wide-angle photos. The 
ascent eased in two spots that after- 
noon, and I made a quick seven 
thousand feet. Higher now than 
Everest, and still going, I. Now, 
though, there were places where I 
crawled and places where I used 
ropes, and there were places where 


I braced myself and used my pneu- 
matic pistol to blast a toehold. (No, 
in case you're wondering: I could 
have broken my eardrums, some 
ribs, an arm and doubtless ultimate- 
ly, my neck, if I’d tried using the 
gun in the chimney.) 

Just near sunset, I came upon a 
high, easy winding way up and up 
and up. I debated with my more 
discreet self. I’d left the message 
that I’d be gone a week. This was 
the end of the third day. I wanted to 
make as much height as possible and 
start back down on the fifth day. If 
I followed the rocky route above me 
as far as it would take me I’d prob- 
ably break forty thousand feet. Then, 
depending, I might have a halfway 
chance of hitting near the ten-mile 
mark before I had to turn back. 
Then I’d be able to get a much bet- 
ter picture of what lay above. 

My more discreet self lost, three 
to nothing, and Mad Jack went on. 

The stars were so big and blazing 
I was afraid they’d bite. The wind 
was no problem. There wasn’t any 
at that height. I had to keep step- 
ping up the temperature controls on 
my suit, and I had the feeling that 
if I could spit around my respirator, 
it would freeze before it hit the 
trail. 

I went on even further than I’d in- 
tended, and I broke forty-two 
thousand that night. 

I found a resting place, stretched 
out, killed my hand beacon. 

It was an odd dream that came to 
me. 

It was all cherry fires and stood 
like a man, only bigger, on the slope 
above me. It stood in an impossible 


THIS MORTAL MOUNTAIN 


43 



position, so I knew I had to be 
dreaming. Something from the other 
end of my life stirred, however, and 
I was convinced for a bitter 
moment that it was the Angel of 
Judgment. Only, in its right hand 
it seemed to hold a sword of fires 
rather than a trumpet. It had been 
standing there forever, the tip of 
its blade pointed toward my breast. 
I could see the stars through it. It 
seemed to speak. 

It said: “Go back ” 

I couldn’t answer, though, for my 
tongue clove to the roof of my 
mouth. And it said it again, and 
yet a third time, “Go back” 

“Tomorrow,” I thought, in my 
dream, and this seemed to satisfy 
it. For it died down and ceased, 
and the blackness rolled about me. 

T he following day, I climbed as 
I hadn’t climbed in years. By 
late lunchtime I’d hit forty-eight 
thousand feet. The cloud cover down 
below had broken. I could see what 
lay beneath me once more. The 
ground was a dark and light patch- 
work. Above, the stars didn’t go 
away. 

The going was rough, but I was 
feeling fine. I knew I couldn’t make 
ten miles, because I could see that 
the way was pretty much the same 
for quite a distance, before it got 
even worse. My good spirits stayed, 
and they continued to rise as I did. 

When it attacked, it came on with 
a speed and fury that I was only 
barely able to match. 

The voice from my dream rang in 
my head: “Go back! Go back! Go 
back !” 


Then it came toward me from out 
of the sky. A bird the size of a con- 
dor. 

Only it wasn't really a bird. 

It was a bird-shaped thing. 

It was all fire and static, and as 
it flashed toward me I barely had 
time to brace my back against stone 
and heft my climbing pick in my 
right hand, ready. 

Ill 

I sat in the small, dark room and 
watched the spinning, colored 
lights. Ultrasonics were tickling my 
skull. I tried to relax and give the 
man some Alpha rhythms. Some- 
where a receiver was receiving, a 
computer was computing and a re- 
corder was recording. 

It lasted perhaps twenty minutes. 
When it was all over and they 
called me out, the doctor collared 
me. I beat him to the draw, though: 
“Give me the tape and send me 
the bill in care of Henry Lanning at 
the Lodge.” 

“I want to discuss the reading,” 
he said. 

“I have my own brain-wave ex- 
pert coming. Just give me the tape.” 
“Have you undergone any sort of 
traumatic experience recently?” 
“You tell me. Is it indicated?” 
“Well, yes and no,” he said. 
“That’s what I like, a straight an- 
swer.” 

“I don’t know what is normal for 
you, in the first place,” he replied. 

“Is there any indication of brain 
damage?” 

“I don’t read it that way. If you’d 
tell me what happened, and why 


44 


IF 



you’re suddenly concerned about 
your brain-waves, perhaps I’d be in 
a better position to ” 

“Cut,” I said. “Just give me the 
tape and bill me.” 

“I’m concerned about you as a 
patient.” 

“But you don’t think there were 
any pathological indications?” 

“Not exactly. But tell me this, if 
you will: Have you had an epileptic 
seizure recently?” 

“Not to my knowledge. Why?” 
“You displayed a pattern similar 
to a residual subrhythm common in 
some forms of epilepsy for several 
days subsequent to a seizure.” 
“Could a bump on the head cause 
that pattern?” 

“It’s highly unlikely.” 

“What else could cause it?” 
“Electrical shock, optical trau- 
ma — ” 

“Stop,” I said, and I removed 
my glasses. “About the optical 
trauma. Look at my eyes.” 

“I’m not an ophtha — ” he be- 
gan, but I interrupted: 

“Most normal light hurts my eyes. 
If I lost my glasses and was ex- 
posed to very bright light for three, 
four days, could that cause the pat- 
tern you spoke of?” 

“Possibly . ...” he said. “Yes, 
I’d say so.” 

“But there’s more?” 

“I’m not sure. We have to take 
more readings, and if I know the 
story behind this it will help a lot.” 
“Sorry,” I said. “I need the tape 
now.” 

He sighed and made a small ges- 
ture with his left hand as he turned 
away. 

THIS MORTAL MOUNTAIN 


“All right, Mister Smith.” 
Cursing the genius of the moun- 
tain, I left the General Hospital, 
carrying my tape like a talisman. In 
my mind I searched, through forests 
of memory, for a ghost-sword in a 
stone of smoke, I think. 

B ack at the Lodge, they were wait- 
ing. Lanning and the newsmen. 
“What was it like?” asked one of 
the latter. 

“What was what like?” 

“The mountain. You were up on 
it, weren’t you?” 

“No comment.” 

“How high did you go?” 

“No comment.” 

“How would you say it compares 
with Kasla?” 

“No comment.” 

“Did you run into any complica- 
tions?” 

“Ditto. Excuse me, I want to take 
a shower.” 

Henry followed me into my room. 
The reporters tried to. 

After I had shaved and washed 
up, mixed a drink and lit a cig- 
arette, Lanning asked me his more 
general question: 

“Well?” he said. 

I nodded. 

“Difficulties?” 

I nodded again. 

“Insurmountable?” 

I hefted the tape and thought a 
moment. 

“Maybe not.” 

He helped himself to the whiskey. 
The second time around, he asked: 
“You going to try?” 

I knew I was. I knew I’d try it all 
by myself if I had to. 


45 




“I really don’t know,” I said. 
“Why not?” 

“Because there’s something up 
there,” I said, “something that 
doesn’t want us to do it.” 
“Something lives up there?” 

“I’m not sure whether that’s the 
right word.” 

He lowered the drink. 

“What the hell happened?” 

“I was threatened. I was at- 
tacked.” 

“Threatened? Verbally? In Eng- 
lish?” He set his drink aside, which 
shows how serious his turn of mind 
had to be. “Attacked?” he added. 
“By what?” 

“I’ve sent for Doc and Kelly and 
Stan and Mallardi and Vincent. I 
checked a little earlier. They’ve all 
replied. They’re coming. Miguel and 
the Dutchman can’t make it, and 


they send their regrets. When we’re 
all together, I’ll tell the story. But 
I want to talk to Doc first. So hold 
tight and worry and don’t quote.” 

He finished his drink. 

“When’ll they be coming?” 

“Four, five weeks,” I said. 

“That’s a long wait.” 

“Under the circumstances,” I 
said, “I can't think of any alterna- 
tives.” 

“What’ll we do in the mean- 
time?” 

“Eat, drink and contemplate the 
mountain.” 

He lowered his eyelids a moment, 
then nodded, reached for his glass. 

“Shall we begin?” 

I t was late, and I stood alone in 
the field with a bottle in one hand. 
Lanning had already turned in, and

night’s chimney was dark with cloud 
soot. Somewhere away from there, 
a storm was storming, and it was 
full of instant outlines. The wind 
came chill. 

“Mountain,” I said. “Mountain, 
you have told me to go away.” 

There was a rumble. 

“But I cannot,” I said, and I 
took a drink. 

“I’m bringing you the best in the 
business,” I said, “to go up on your 
slopes and to stand beneath the stars 
in your highest places. I must do this 
thing because you are there. No 
other reason. Nothing personal. .” 

After a time, I said, “That’s not 
true. 

“I’m a man,” I said, “and I need 
to break mountains to prove that I 
will not die even though I will die. 
I am less than I want to be, Sister, 
and you can make me more. So I 
guess it is personal. 

“It’s the only thing I know how 
to do, and you’re the last one left — 
the last challenge to the skill I 
spent my life learning. Maybe it is 
that mortality is closest to immortali- 
ty when it accepts a challenge to it- 
self, when it survives a threat. The 
moment of triumph is the moment 
of salvation. I have needed many 
such moments, and the final one 
must be the longest, for it must last 
me the rest of my life. 

“So you are there, Sister, and I 
am here and very mortal, and you 
have told me to go away. I cannot. 
I’m coming up, and if you throw 
death at me I will face it. It must 
be so.” 

I finished what remained in the 
bottle. 


There were more flashes, more 
rumbles behind the mountain, more 
flashes. 

“It is the closest thing to divine 
drunkenness,” I said to the thun- 
der. 

And then she winked at me. It 
was a red star, so high upon her. 
Angel’s sword. Phoenix’s wing. Soul 
on fire. And it blazed at me, across 
the miles. Then the wind that blows 
between the worlds swept down over 
me. It was filled with tears and with 
crystals of ice. I stood there and 
felt it, then, “Don’t go away,” I 
said, and I watched until all was 
darkness once more and I was wet 
as an embryo waiting to cry out and 
breathe. 

M ost kids tell lies to their play- 
mates — fictional autobiogra- 
phies, if you like — which are either 
received with appropriate awe or 
countered with greater, more ela- 
borate tellings. But little Jimmy, I’ve 
heard, always hearkened to his little 
buddies with wide, dark eyes, and 
near the endings of their stories the 
corners of his mouth would begin to 
twitch. By the time they were fin- 
ished talking, his freckles would be 
mashed into a grin and his rusty 
head cocked to the side. His favorite 
expression, I understand, was 
“G’wan!” and his nose was broken 
twice before he was twelve. This 
was doubtless why he turned it to- 
ward books. 

Thirty years and four formal de- 
grees later, he sat across from me 
in my quarters in the Lodge, and I 
called him Doc because everyone did, 
because he had a license to cut

people up and look inside them, as 
well as doctoring to their philosophy, 
so to speak, and because he looked 
as if he should be called Doc when 
he grinned and cocked his head to 
the side and said, “G^an!” 

I wanted to punch him in the 
nose. 

“Damn it! It’s true!” I told him. 
“I fought with a bird of fire!” 

“We all hallucinated on Kasla,” 
he said, raising one finger, “because 
of fatigue,” two fingers, “because 
the altitude affected our circula- 
tory systems and consequently our 
brains,” three, “because of the emo- 
tional stimulation,” four, “and be- 
cause we were partly oxygen-drunk.” 
“You just ran out of fingers, if 
you’ll sit on your other hand for 
a minute. So listen,” I said, “it flew 
at me, and I swung at it, and it 
knocked me out and broke my gog- 
gles. When I woke up, it was gone 
and I was lying on the ledge. I think 
it was some sort of energy creature. 
You saw my EEG, and it wasn’t 
normal. I think it shocked my ner- 
vous system when it touched me.” 
“You were knocked out because 
you hit your head against a rock — ” 
“It caused me to fall back against 
the rock!” 

“I agree with that part. The rock 
was real. But nowhere in the uni- 
verse has anyone ever discovered an 
‘energy creature.’ ” 

“So? You probably would have 
said that about America a thou- 
sand years ago.” 

“Maybe I would have. But that 
neurologist explained your EEG to 
my satisfaction. Optical trauma. 
Why go out of your way to dream 


up on exotic explanation for events? 
Easy ones generally turn out bet- 
ter. You hallucinated and you 
stumbled.” 

“Okay,” I said, “whenever I argue 
with you I generally need ammuni- 
tion. Hold on a minute.” 

I went to my closet and fetched it 
down from the top shelf. I placed 
it on my bed and began unwrapping 
the blanket I had around it. 

“I told you I took a swing at it,” 
I said. “Well, I connected — right 
before I went under. Here!” 

I held up my climbing pick — 
brown, yellow, black and pitted — 
looking as though it had fallen from 
outer space. 

He took it into his hands and 
stared at it for a long time, then he 
started to say something about ball 
lightning, changed his mind, shook 
his head and placed the thing back 
on the blanket. 

“I don’t know,” he finally said, 
and this time his freckles remained 
unmashed, except for those at the 
edges of his hands which got caught 
as he clenched them, slowly.

W e planned. We mapped and 
charted and studied the pho- 
tos. We plotted our ascent and we 
started a training program. 

While Doc and Stan had kept 
themselves in good shape, neither 
had been climbing since Kasla. Kelly 
was in top condition. Henry was on 
his way to fat. Mallardi and Vince, 
as always, seemed capable of fan- 
tastic feats of endurance and virtuo- 
sity, had even climbed a couple

times during the past year, hut had 
recently been living pretty high on 
the tall hog, so to speak, and they 
wanted to get some practice. So we 
picked a comfortable, decent-sized 
mountain and gave it ten days to 
beat everyone back into shape. After 
that, we stuck to vitamins, calisthen- 
ics and square diets while we com- 
pleted our preparations. During this 
time, Doc came up with seven shiny, 
alloy boxes, about six by four inches 
and thin as a first book of poems, 
for us to carry on our persons to 
broadcast a defense against the 
energy creature which he refused 
to admit existed. 

One fine, bitter-brisk morning we 
were ready. The newsmen liked me 
again. Much footage was taken of 
our gallant assemblage as we packed 
ourselves into the fliers, to be de- 
livered at the foot of the lady moun- 
tain, there to contend for what was 
doubtless the final time as the team 
we had been for so many years, 
against the waiting gray and the 
lavender beneath the sunwhite 
flame. 

We approached the mountain, and 
I wondered how much she weighed. 

Y ou know the way, for the first 
nine miles. So I’ll skip over that. 
It took us six days and part of a 
seventh. Nothing out of the ordinary 
occurred. Some fog there was, and 
nasty winds, but once below, for- 
gotten. 

Stan and Mallardi and I stood 
where the bird had occurred, wait- 
ing for Doc and the others. 

“So far, it’s been a picnic,” said 
Mallardi. 


“Yeah,” Stan acknowledged. 

“No birds either.” 

“No,” I agreed. 

“Do you think Doc was right — 
about it being an hallucination?” 
Mallardi asked. “I remember see- 
ing things on Kasla . ” 

“As I recall,” said Stan, “it was 
nymphs and an ocean of beer. Why 
would anyone want to see hot 
birds?” 

“Damfino.” 

“Laugh, you hyenas,” I said. 
“But just wait till a flock flies over.” 
Doc came up and looked around. 
“This is the place?” 

I nodded. 

He tested the background radia- 
tion and half a dozen other things, 
found nothing untoward, grunted 
and looked upwards. 

We all did. Then we went there. 
It was very rough for three days, 
and we only made another five 
thousand feet during that time. 

When we bedded down, we were 
bushed, and sleep came quickly. So 
did Nemesis. 

He was there again, only not quite 
so near this time. He burned about 
twenty feet away, standing in the 
middle of the air, and the point of 
his blade indicated me. 

“Go away* 9 he said, three times, 
without inflection. 

“Go to hell,” I tried to say. 

He made as if he wished to draw 
nearer. He failed. 

“Go away yourself,” I said. 
“Climb back down. Depart. You 
may go no further ” 

“But I am going further. All the 
way to the top.” 

“No. You may not.” 


50 


IF 



“Stick around and watch,” I said. 

“Go back ” 

“If you want to stand there and 
direct traffic, that’s your business,” 
I told him. “I’m going back to 
sleep.” 

I crawled over and shook Doc’s 
shoulder, but when I looked back 
my flaming visitor had departed. 

“What is it?” 

“Too late,” I said. “He’s been 
here and gone.” 

Doc sat up. 

“The bird?” 

“No, the thing with the sword.” 

“Where was he?” 

“Standing out there,” I gestured. 

Doc hauled out his instruments 
and did many things with them for 
ten minutes or so. 

“Nothing,” he finally said. “May- 
be you were dreaming.” 

“Yeah, sure,” I said. “Sleep tight,” 
and I hit the sack again, and this 
time I made it through to daylight 
without further fire or ado. 

I t took us four days to reach sixty 
thousand feet. Rocks fell like 
occasional cannonballs past us, and 
the sky was a big pool, cool, where 
pale flowers floated. When we 
struck sixty-three thousand, the go- 
ing got much better, and we made 
it up to seventy-five thousand in 
two and a half more days. No fiery 
things stopped by to tell me to turn 
back. Then came the unforeseeable, 
however, and we had enough in the 
way of natural troubles to keep us 
cursing. 

We hit a big, level shelf. 

It was perhaps four hundred feet 
wide. As we advanced across it, 


we realized that it did not strike 
the mountainside. It dropped off 
into an enormous gutter of a canyon. 
We would have to go down again, 
perhaps seven hundred feet, before 
we could proceed upward once 
more. Worse yet, it led to a feature- 
less face which strove for and 
achieved perpendicularity for a dead- 
ly high distance: like miles. The 
top was still nowhere in sight. 

“Where do we go now?” asked 
Kelly, moving to my side. 

“Down,” I decided, “and we split 
up. We’ll follow the big ditch in 
both directions and see which way 
gives the better route up. We’ll meet 
back at the midway point.” 

We descended. Then Doc and 
Kelly and I went left, and the others 
took the opposite way. 

After an hour and a half, our 
trail came to an end. We stood 
looking at nothing over the edge of 
something. Nowhere, during the en- 
tire time, had we come upon a de- 
cent way up. I stretched out, my 
head and shoulders over the edge, 
Kelly holding onto my ankles, and 
I looked as far as I could to the 
right and up. There was nothing 
in sight that was worth a facing 
movement. 

“Hope the others had better luck,” 
I said, after they’d dragged me 
back. 

“And if they haven’t . ?” asked 
Kelly. 

“Let’s wait.” 

They had. 

It was risky, though. 

There was no good way straight 
up out of the gap. The trail had 
ended at a forty-foot wail which, 


THIS MORTAL MOUNTAIN 


51 



when mounted, gave a clear view 
all the way down. Leaning out as 
I had done and looking about two 
hundred feet to the left and eighty 
feet higher, however, Mallardi had 
rested his eyes on a rough way, but 
a way, nevertheless, leading up and 
west and vanishing. 

We camped in the gap that night. 
In the morning, I anchored my line 
to a rock, Doc tending, and went 
out with the pneumatic pistol. I 
fell twice, and made forty feet of 
trail by lunchtime. 

I rubbed my bruises then, and 
Henry took over. After ten feet, 
Kelly got out to anchor a couple 
of body-lengths behind him, and we 
tended Kelly. 

Then Stan blasted and Mallardi 
anchored. Then there had to be 
three on the face. Then four. By 
sundown, we’d made a hundred-fifty 
feet and were covered with white 
powder. A bath would have been 
nice. We settled for ultrasonic shake- 
downs. 

B y lunch the next day, we were 
all out there, roped together, 
hugging cold stone, moving slowly, 
painfully, slowly, not looking down 
much. 

By day’s end, we’d made it across, 
to the place where we could hold on 
and feel something — granted, not 
much — beneath our boots. It was 
inclined to be a trifle scant, how- 
ever, to warrant less than a full day- 
light assault. So we returneed once 
more to the gap. 

In the morning, we crossed. 

The way kept its winding angle. 
We headed west and up. We traveled 


a mile and made five hundred feet. 
We traveled another mile and made 
perhaps three hundred. 

Then a ledge occurred, about forty 
feet overhead. 

Stan went up the hard way, using 
the gun, to see what he could see. 

He gestured, and we followed; and 
the view that broke upon us was 
good. 

Down right, irregular but wide 
enough, was our new camp. 

The way above it, ice cream and 
whiskey sours and morning coffee 
and a cigarette after dinner. It was 
beautiful and delicious: a seventy- 
degree slope full of ledges and pro- 
jections and good clean stone. 

“Hot damn!” said Kelly. 

We all tended to agree. 

We ate and we drank and we de- 
cided to rest our bruised selves that 
afternoon. 

We were in the twilight world 
now, walking where no man had 
ever walked before, and we felt our- 
selves to be golden. It was good to 
stretch out and try to unache. 

I slept away the day, and when 
I awakened the sky was a bed of 
glowing embers. I lay there too lazy 
to move, too full of sight to go back 
to sleep. A meteor burnt its way 
bluewhite across the heavens. After a 
time, there was another. I thought 
upon my position and decided that 
reaching it was worth the price. The 
cold, hard happiness of the heights 
filled me. I wiggled my toes. 

After a few minutes, I stretched 
and sat up. I regarded the sleeping 
forms of my companions. I looked 
out across the night as far as I 
could see. Then I looked up at the

IF 



mountain, then dropped my eyes 
slowly along tomorrow’s trail. 

There was movement within shad- 
ow. 

Something was standing about fif- 
ty feet away and ten feet above. 

I picked up my pick and stood. 

I crossed the fifty and stared up. 

She was smiling, not burning. 

A woman, an impossible woman. 

Absolutely impossible. For one 
thing, she would just have to freeze 
to death in a mini-skirt and a sleeve- 
less shell-top. No alternative. For 
another, she had very little to 
breathe. Like, nothing. 

But it didn’t seem to bother her. 
She waved. Her hair was dark and 
long, and I couldn’t see her eyes. 
The planes of her pale, high cheeks, 
wide forehead, small chin cor- 
responded in an unsettling fashion 
with certain simple theorems which 
comprise the geometry of my heart. 
If all angles, planes, curves be cor- 
rect, it skips a beat, then hurries to 
make up for it. 

1 worked it out, felt it do so, said, 
“Hello.” 

“Hello, Whitey,” she replied. 
“Come down,” I said. 

“No, you come up.” 

I swung my pick. When I reached 
the ledge she wasn’t there. I looked 
around, then I saw her. 

She was seated on a rock twelve 
feet above me. 

“How it is that you know my 
name?” I asked. 

“Anyone can see what your name 
must be.” 

“All right,” I agreed. “What’s 
yours?” 


“ . ” Her lips seemed to move, 
but I heard nothing. 

“Come again?” 

“I don’t want a name,” she said* 
“Okay. I’ll call you ‘girl,’ then.” 
She laughed, sort of. 

“What are you doing here?* I 
asked. 

“Watching you.” 

“Why?” 

“To see whether you’ll fall.” 

“I can save you the trouble,” I 
said. “I won’t.” 

“Perhaps,” she said. 

“Come down here,” 

“No, you come up here.” 

I climbed, but when I got there 
she was twenty feet higher. 

“Girl, you climb well,” I said, 
and she laughed and turned away. 

I pursued her for five minutes 
and couldn’t catch her. There was 
something unnatural about the way 
she moved. 

I stopped climbing when she 
turned again. We were still about 
twenty feet apart. 

“I take it you do not really wish 
me to join you,” I said. 

“Of course I do, but you must 
catch me first.” And she turned 
once more, and I felt a certain fury 
within me. 

It was written that no one could 
outclimb Mad Jack. I had written 
it. 

I swung my pick and moved like 
a lizard. 

I was near to her a couple of 
times, but never near enough. 

The day’s aches began again in 
my muscles, but I pulled my way 
up without slackening my pace. I 
realized, faintly, that the camp was 


THIS MORTAL MOUNTAIN 



far below me now, and that I was 
climbing alone through the dark up 
a strange slope. But I did not stop. 
Rather, I hurried, and my breath 
began to come hard in my lungs. I 
heard her laughter, and it was a goad. 
Then I came upon a two-inch ledge, 
and she was moving along it. I fol- 
lowed, around a big bulge of rock to 
where it ended. Then she was ninety 
feet above me, at the top of a smooth 
pinnacle. It was like a tapering, 
branchless tree. How she’d ac- 
complished it, I didn’t know. I was 
gasping by then, but I looped my 
line around it and began to climb. 
As I did this, she spoke: 

“Don’t you ever tire, Whitey? I 
thought you would have collapsed by 
now.” 

I hitched up the line and climbed 
further. 

“You can’t make it up here, 
you know.” 

“I don’t know,” I grunted. 

“Why do you want so badly to 
climb here? There are other nice 
mountains.” 

“This is the biggest, girl. That’s 
why.” 

“It can’t be done.” 

“Then why all this bother to dis- 
courage me? Why not just let the 
mountain do it?” 

As I neared her, she vanished. 
I made it to the top, where she had 
been standing, and I collapsed 
there. 

Then I heard her voice again and 
turned my head. She was on a 
ledge, perhaps eighty feet away. 

“I didn’t think you’d make it 
this far,” she said. “You are a fool. 
Good-by, Whitey.” She was gone. 


I sat there on the pinnacle's tiny 
top — perhaps four square feet 
of top — and I knew that I 
couldn’t sleep there, because I’d 
fall. And I was tired. 

I recalled my favorite curses and 
I said them all, but I didn’t feel 
any better. I couldn’t let myself 
go to sleep. I looked down. I knew 
the way was long. I knew she didn’t 
think I could make it. 

I began the descent. 

T he following morning when 
they shook me, I was still tired. 
I told them the last night’s tale, and 
they didn’t believe me. Not until 
later in the day, that is, when I 
detoured us around the bulge and 
showed them the pinnacle, standing 
there like a tapering, branchless 
tree, ninety feet in the middle of 
the air. 

V 

W e went steadily upward for the 
next two days. We made 
slightly under ten thousand feet. 
Then we spent a day hammering 
and hacking our way up a great 
flat face. Six hundred feet of it. Then 
our way was to the right and up- 
ward. Before long we were ascend- 
ing the western side of the moun- 
tain. When we broke ninety thou- 
sand feet, we stopped to congratulate 
ourselves that we had just surpassed 
the Kasla climb and to remind our- 
selves that we had still had not hit 
the halfway mark. It took us another 
two and a half days to do that, and 
by then the land lay like a map be- 
neath us.

IF 



And then, that night, we all saw 
the creature with the sword. 

He came and stood near our 
camp, and he raised his sword above 
his head, and it blazed with such 
a terrible intensity that I slipped 
on my goggles. His voice was all 
thunder and lightning this time: 

“Get off this mountain!” he said. 
“Now! Turn back! Go down! De- 
part!” 

And then a shower of stones came 
down from above and rattled about 
us. Doc tossed his slim, shiny case, 
causing it to skim along the ground 
toward the creature. 

The light went out, and we were 
alone. 

Doc retrieved his case, took tests, 
met with the same success as be- 
fore — i.e. f none. But now at least 
he didn’t think I was some kind of 
balmy, unless of course he thought 
we all were. 

“Not a very effective guardian,” 
Henry suggested. 

“We’ve a long way to go yet,” 
said Vince, shying a stone through 
the space the creature had occupied. 
“I don’t like it if the thing can 
cause a slide.” 

“That was just a few pebbles,” 
said Stan. 

“Yeah, but what if he decided to 
start them fifty thousand feet high- 
*er?” 

“Shut up!” said Kelly. “Don’t give 
him any ideas. He might be listen- 
ing.” 

For some reason, we drew closer 
together. Doc made each of us 
describe what we had seen, and it 
appeared that we all had seen the 
same thing. 


“All right,” I said, after we’d fin- 
ished. “Now you’ve all seen it, who 
wants to go back?” 

There was silence. 

After perhaps half a dozen heart- 
beats, Henry said, “I want the whole 
story. It looks like a good one. I’m 
willing to take my chances with 
angry energy creatures in order to 
get it.” 

“I don't know what the thing 
is,” said Kelly. “Maybe it’s no ener- 
gy creature. Maybe it’s something — 
supernatural — I know what you’ll 
say, Doc. I’m just telling you how 
it struck me. If there are such things, 
this seems a good place for them. 
Point is — whatever it is, I don’t 
care. I want this mountain. If it 
could have stopped us, I think it 
would’ve done it already. Maybe I’m 
wrong. Maybe it can. Maybe it’s 
laid some trap for us higher up. 
But I want this mountain. Right now, 
it means more to me than anything. 
If I don’t go up, I’ll spend all my 
time wondering about it — and then 
I’ll probably come back and try it 
again some day, when it gets so I 
can’t stand thinking about it any 
more. Only then, maybe the rest of 
you won’t be available. Let’s face it, 
we’re a good climbing team. Maybe , 
the best in the business. Probably. 
If it can be done, I think we can 
do it.” 

“I’ll second that,” said Stan. 

^TXThat you said, Kelly,” said 
VV Mallardi, “about it being 
supernatural — it’s funny, because 
I felt the same thing for a minute 
when I was looking at it. It re- 
minds me of something out of the

Divine Comedy . If you recall, Pur- 
gatory was a mountain. And then I 
thought of the angel who guarded 
the eastern way to Eden. Eden had 
gotten moved to the top of Purga- 
tory hy Dante — and there was this 
angel .... Anyhow, I felt almost 
like I was committing some sin I 
didn’t know about by being here. 
But now that I think it over, a man 
can’t be guilty of something he 
doesn’t know is wrong, can he? And 
I didn’t see that thing flashing any 
angel ID card. So I’m willing to go 
up and see what’s on top, unless 
he comes back with the Tablets of 
the Law, with a new one written 
in at the bottom.” 

“In Hebrew or Italian?” asked 
Doc. 

“To satisfy you, I suppose they’d 
have to be drawn up in the form 
of equations.” 

“No,” he said. “Kidding aside, I 
felt something funny too, when I 
saw it and heard it. And we didn’t 
really hear it, you know. It skipped 
over the senses and got its message 
right into our brains. If you think 
back over our descriptions of what 
we experienced, we each ‘heard* 
different words telling us to go away. 
If it can communicate a meaning 
as well as a psychtranslator, I won- 
der if it can communicate an emo- 
tion, also .... You thought of an 
angel, too, didn’t you, Whitey?” 

“Yes,” I said. 

“That makes it almost unanimous 
then, doesn’t it?” 

Then we all turned to Vince, be- 
cause he had no Christian back- 
ground at all, having been raised 
as a Buddhist on Ceylon. 


“What were your feelings con- 
cerning the thing?” Doc asked him. 

“It was a Deva,” he said, “a sort 
of like an angel, I guess. I had the 
impression that every step I took 
up this mountain gave me enough 
bad karma to fill a lifetime. Except 
I haven’t believed in it that way 
since I was a kid. I want to go 
ahead, up. Even if that feeling was 
correct, I want to see the top of 
this mountain.” 

“So do I,” said Doc. 

“That makes it unanimous,” I 
said. 

“Well, everybody hang onto his 
angelsbane,” said Stan, “and let’s 
sack out.” 

“Good idea.” 

“Only let’s spread out a bit,” said 
Doc, “so that anything falling won’t 
get all of us together.” 

We did that cheerful thing and 
slept untroubled by heaven. 

O ur way kept winding right, until 
we were at a hundred forty- 
four thousand feet and were mount- 
ing the southern slopes. Then it 
jogged back, and by a hundred fifty 
we were mounting to the west once 
more. 

Then, during a devilish, dark and 
tricky piece of scaling, up a smooth, 
concave bulge ending in an over- 
hand, the bird came down once 
again. 

If we hadn’t been roped together, 
Stan would have died. As it was, we 
almost all died. 

Stan was lead man, as its wings 
splashed sudden flames against the 
violet sky. It came down from the 
overhang as though someone had

IF 



kicked a bonfire over its edge, bead- 
ed straight toward him and faded 
out at a distance of about twelve feet. 
He fell then, almost taking the rest 
of us with him. 

We tensed our muscles and took 
the shock. 

He was battered a bit, but un- 
broken. We made it up to the over- 
hang, but went no further that day. 

Rocks did fall, but we found 
another overhang and made camp 
beneath it. 

The bird did not return that day, 
but the snakes came. 

Big, shimmering scarlet serpents 
coiled about the crags, wound in 
and out of jagged fields of ice and 
gray stone. Sparks shot along their 
sinuous lengths. They coiled and un- 
wound, stretched and turned, spat 
fires at us. It seemed they were 
trying to drive us from beneath the 
sheltering place to where the rocks 
could come down upon us. 

Doc advanced upon the nearest 
one, and it vanished as it came with- 
in the field of his projector. He 
studied the place where it had lain, 
then hurried back. 

“The frost is still on the punkin,” 
he said. 

“Huh?” said I. 

“Not a bit of ice was melted be- 
neath it.” 

“Indicating?” 

“Illusion,” said Vince, and he 
threw a stone at another and it pass- 
ed through the thing. 

“But you saw what happened to 
my pick,” I said to Doc, ‘Svhen 
I took a cut at that bird. The thing 
had to have been carrying some 
kind of charge.” 


“Maybe whatever has been send- 
ing them has cut that part out, as a 
waste of energy,” he replied, “since 
the things can’t get through to us 
anyhow.” 

We sat around and watched the 
snakes and falling rocks, until Stan 
produced a deck of cards and sug- 
gested a better game. 

T he snakes stayed on through the 
night and followed us the next 
day. Rocks still fell periodically, but 
the boss seemed to be running low 
on them. The bird appeared, circled 
us and swooped on four different 
occasions. But this time we ignored 
it, and finally it went home to roost. 

We made three thousand feet, 
could have gone more, but didn’t 
want to press it past a cozy little 
ledge with a cave big enough for 
the whole party, Everything let up 
on us then. Everything visible, that 
is. 

A before-the-storm feeling, a still, 
electrical tension, seemed to occur 
around us then, and we waited for 
whatever was going to happen to 
happen. 

The worst possible thing hap- 
pened: nothing. 

This keyed-up feeling, this ex- 
pectancy, stayed with us, was un- 
satisfied. I think it would actually 
have been a relief if some invisible 
orchestra had begun playing Wag- 
ner, or if the heavens had rolled 
aside like curtains and revealed a 
movie screen, and from the back- 
ward lettering we knew we were 
on the other side, or if we saw a 
high-flying dragon eating low-flying 
weather satellites.

As it was, we just kept feeling 
that something was imminent, and 
it gave me insomnia. 

During the night, she came again. 
The pinnacle girl. 

She stood at the mouth of the 
cave, and when I advanced she re- 
treated. 

I stopped just inside and stood 
there myself, where she had been 
standing. 

She said, “Hello, Whitey.” 
“No, I’m not going to follow you 
again,” I said. 

“I didn’t ask you to.” 

“What’s a girl like you doing 
in a place like this?” 

“Watching,” she said. 

“I told you I won’t fall.” 

“Your friend almost did.” 
“‘Almost* isn’t good enough.” 
“You are the leader, aren’t you?” 
“That’s right.” 

“If you were to die, the others 
would go back?” 

“No,” I said, “they’d go on with- 
out me.” 

I hit my camera then. 

“What did you just do?” she 
asked. 

“I took your picture — if you’re 
really there.” 

“Why?” 

“To look at after you go away. I 
like to look at pretty things.” 

“ . ” she seemed to say some- 
thing. 

“What?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Why not?” 

“ die.” 

“Please speak up.” 

“She dies ...” she said. 

“Why? How?” 


M .... on mountain.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“What's* wrong?” 

I took a step forward, and she re- 
treated a step. 

“Follow me?” she asked. 

“No.” 

“Go back,” she said. 

“What’s on the other side of that 
record?” 

“You will continue to climb?” 
“Yes.” 

Then, “Good!” she said suddenly. 
“I — ,” and her voice stopped again. 

“Go back,” she finally said, with- 
out emotion. 

“Sorry.” 

And she was gone. 

VI 

O ur trail took us slowly to the 
left once more. We crawled and 
sprawled and cut holes in the stone. 
Snakes sizzled in the distance. They 
were with us constantly now. The 
bird came again at crucial moments, 
to try to make us fall. A raging bull 
stood on a crag and bellowed down 
at us. Phantom archers loosed shafts 
of fire, which always faded right be- 
fore they struck. Blazing blizzards 
swept at us, around us, were gone. 
We were back on the northern slopes 
and still heading west by the time 
we broke a hundred sixty thousand. 
The sky was deep and blue, and 
there were always stars. Why did 
the mountain hate us? I wondered. 
What was there about us to provoke 
this thing? I looked at the picture of 
the girl for the dozenth time and I 
wondered what she really was. Had 


58 


IF 



she been picked from our minds 
and composed into girlform to lure 
us, to lead us, sirenlike, harpylike, 
to the place of the final fall? It was 
such a long way down .... 

I thought back over my life. How 
does a man come to climb moun- 
tains? Is he drawn by the heights 
because he is afraid of the level 
land? Is he such a misfit in the so- 
ciety of men that he must flee and 
try to place himself above it? The 
way up is long and difficult, but if he 
6uoceeds they must grant him a gar- 
land of sorts. And if he falls, this 
too is a kind of glory. To end, hurled 
from the heights to the depths in 
hideous ruin and combustion down, 
is a fitting climax for the loser — 
for it, too, shakes mountains and 
minds, stirs things like thoughts be- 
low both, is a kind of blasted gar- 
land of victory in defeat, and cold, 
so cold that final action, that the 
movement is somewhere frozen for- 
ever into a statuelike rigidity of 
ultimate intent and purpose thwarted 
only by the universal malevolence 
we all fear exists. An aspirant saint 
or hero who lacks some necessary 
virtue may still qualify as a matyr, 
for the only thing that people will 
really remember in the end is the 
end. I had known that I’d had to 
climb Kasla, as I had climbed all 
the others, and I had known what 
the price would be. It had cost me 
my only home. But Kasla was there, 
and my boots cried out for my feet. 
I knew as I did so that somewhere 
I set them upon her summit, and 
below me a world was ending. 
What’s a world if the moment of 
victory is at hand? And if truth, 


beauty and goodness be one, why is 
there always this conflict among 
them? 

The phantom archers fired upon 
me and the bright bird swooped. I 
set my teeth, and my boots scarred 
rocks beneath me. 

e saw the top. 

At a hundred seventy-six 
thousand feet, making our way along 
a narrow ledge, clicking against rock, 
testing our way with our picks, we 
heard Vince say, “Look!” . 

We did. 

Up and up, and again further, 
bluefrosted and sharp, deadly, and 
cold as Loki’s dagger, slashing at 
the sky, it vibrated above us like 
electricity, hung like a piece of froz- 
en thunder, and cut, cut, cut into 
the center of spirit that was desire, 
twisted, and became a fishhook to 
pull us on, to burn us with its barbs. 

Vince was the first to look up 
and see the top, the first to die. It 
happened so quickly, and it was 
none of the terrors that achieved it. 

He slipped. 

That was all. It was a difficult 
piece of climbing. He was right 
behind me one second, was gone 
the next. There was no body to re- 
cover. He’d taken the long drop. The 
soundless blue was all around him 
and the great gray beneath. Then 
we were six. We shuddered, and 
I suppose we all prayed in our own 
ways. 

— Gone Vince, may some good 
Deva lead you up the Path of Splen- 
dor. May you find whatever you 
wanted most at the other end, wait- 
ing there for you. If such a thing

may foe, remember those who say 
these words, oh strong intruder in 
the sky .... 

No one spoke much for the rest 
of the day. 

The fiery sword bearer came and 
stood above our camp the entire 
night. It did not speak. 

In the morning, Stan was gone, 
and there was a note beneath my 
pack. 

Don't hate me, it said, for run- 
ning out, but l think it really is an 
angel . I'm scared of this mountain. 
I'll climb any pile of rocks, but l 
won't fight Heaven. The way down 
is easier than the way up, so don't 
worry about me. Good luck. Try to 
understand. S. 

So we were five — Doc and Kel- 
ly and Henry and Mallardi and me 
— and that day we hit a hundred 
eighty thousand and felt very alone. 

The girl came again that night 
and spoke to me, black hair against 
black sky and eyes like points of 
blue fire, and she stood beside an 
icy pillar and said: “Two of you 
have gone.” 

“And the rest of us remain,” I 
replied. 

“For a time.” 

“We will climb to the top and 
then we will go away,” I said. “How 
can that do you harm? Why do you 
hate us?” 

“No hate, sir,” she said. 

“What, then?” 

“I protect.” 

“What? What is it that you pro- 
tect?” 

“The dying, that she may live.” 

“What? Who is dying? How?” 

But her words went away some- 


where, and I did not hear them. Then 
she went away too, and there was 
nothing left but sleep for the rest 
of the night. 

O ne hundred eighty-two thousand 
and three, and four, and five. 
Then back down to four for the 
following night. 

The creatures whined about us 
now, and the land pulsed beneath 
us, and the mountain seemed some- 
times to sway as we climbed. 

We carved a path to one eighty-six, 
and for three days we fought to 
gain another thousand feet. Every- 
thing we touched was cold and slick 
and slippery, sparkled, and had a 
bluish haze about it. 

When we hit one ninety, Henry 
looked back and shuddered. 

“I’m no longer worried about 
making it to the top,” he said. “It’s 
the return trip that's bothering me 
now. The clouds are like little wisps 
of cotton way down there.” 

“The sooner up, the sooner 
down,” I said, and we began to 
climb once again. 

It took us another week to cut 
our way to within a mile of the 
top. All the creatures of fire had 
withdrawn, but two ice avalanches 
showed us we were still unwanted. 
We survived the first without mis- 
hap, but Kelly sprained his right 
ankle during the second, and Doc 
thought he might have cracked a 
couple of ribs, too. 

We made a camp. Doc stayed 
there with him; Henry and Mallardi 
and I pushed on up the last mile. 

Now the going was beastly. It had 
become a mountain of glass. We had

Our packs became monstrous loads “How’s Kelly?” I asked, 

and our fingers grew numb. Our “Better,” he replied. “Those ribs

When we awakened, there was Henry and I used the binoculars, 

just Henry and myself. There was Snake? A better word might be 

no indication of where Mallardi had dragon — or maybe even Midgaard 
gotten to. Henry switched his com- Serpent.

It was coiled around the peak, 
head upraised. It seemed to be sev- 
eral hundred feet in length, and it 
moved its head from side to side, 
and up and down, and it smoked 
solar coronas. 

Then I spotted Mallardi climbing 
toward it. 

“Don’t go any further!” I called. 
“I don’t know whether your unit 
will protect you against anything like 
that! Wait’ll I call Doc — ” 

“Not a chance,” he said. “This 
baby is mine.” 

“Listen! You can be first on the 
mountain, if that’s what you want! 
But don't tackle that thing alone!” 
“A laugh was the only reply.” 

“All three units might hold it off,” 
I said. “Wait for us.” 

There was no answer, and we 
began to climb. 

I left Henry far below me. The 
creature was a moving light in the 
sky. I made two hundred feet in 
a hurry, and when I looked up again, 
I saw that the creature had grown 
two more heads. Lightnings flashed 
from its nostrils, and its tail whipped 
around the mountain. I made an- 
other hundred feet, and I could see 
Mallardi clearly by then, climbing 
steadily, outlined against the bril- 
liance. I swung my pick, gasping, 
and I fought the mountain, follow- 
ing the trail he had cut. I began 
to gain on him, because he was still 
pounding out his way and I didn’t 
have that problem. Then I heard 
him talking: 

“Not yet, big fella, not yet,” he 
was saying, from behind a wall of 
static. “Here’s a ledge . ” 

I looked up, and he vanished. 


Then that fiery tail came lashing 
down toward where I had last seen 
him, and I heard him curse and I 
felt the vibrations of his pneumatic 
gun. The tail snapped back again, 
and I heard another “Damn!” 

I made haste, stretching and rock- 
ing myself and grabbing at the 
holds he had cut, and then I heard 
him burst into song. Something from 
Aida , I think. 

“Damn it! Wait up!” I said. “I’m 
only a few hundred feet behind.” 

He kept on singing. 

I was beginning to get dizzy, but 
I couldn’t let myself slow down. My 
right arm felt like a piece of wood, 
my left like a piece of ice. My feet 
were hooves, and my eyes burned in 
my head. 

Then it happened. 

Like a bomb, the snake and the 
swinging ended in a flash of bril- 
liance that caused me to sway and 
almost lose my grip. I clung to the 
vibrating mountainside and squeezed 
my eyes against the light. 

“Mallardi?” I said. 

No answer. Nothing. 

I looked down. Henry was still 
clinging. I continued to climb. 

I reached the ledge Mallardi had 
mentioned, found him there. 

His respirator was still working. 
His protective suit was blackened 
and scorched on the right side. Half 
of his pick had been melted away. 
I raised his shoulders. 

I turned up the volume on the 
communicator and heard him 
breathing. His eyes opened, closed, 
opened. 

“Okay . .” he said. 


62 


IF 



“ ‘Okay,* hell! Where do you 
hurt?” 

“No place .... I feel jus’ fine 
. Listen! I think it’s used up its 
juice for awhile .... Go plant the 
flag. Prop me up here first, though. 
I wanna watch . ” 

I got him into a better position, 
squirted the water bulb, listened to 
him swallow. Then I waited for 
Henry to catch up. It took about 
six minutes. 

“I’ll stay here,” said Henry, 
stooping beside him. “You go do 
it.” 

“I started up the final slope. 

VII 

I swung and I cut and I blasted and 
I crawled. Some of the ice had 
been melted, the rocks scorched. 

Nothing came to oppose me. The 
static had gone with the dragon. 
There was silence, and darkness be- 
tween stars. 

I climbed slowly, still tired from 
that last sprint, but determined not 
to stop. 

All but sixty feet of the entire 
world lay beneath me, and heaven 
hung above me, and a rocket winked 
overhead. Perhaps it was the press- 
men, with zoom cameras. 

Fifty feet .... 

No bird, no archer, no angel, no 
girl. 

Forty feet .... 

I started to shake. It was nervous 
tension. I steadied myself, went on. 

Thirty feet . and the mountain 
seemed to be swaying now. 

Twenty-five . and I grew dizzy, 
halted, took a drink. 


Then click, click, my pick again. 
Twenty .... 

Fifteen .... 

Ten .... 

I braced myself against the moun- 
tain’s final assault, whatever it might 
be. 

Five .... 

Nothing happened as I arrived. 

I stood up. I could go no higher. 
I looked at the sky, I looked back 
down. I waved at the blazing rocket 
exhaust. 

I extruded the pole and attached 
the flag. 

I planted it, there where no 
breezes would ever stir it. I cut in my 
communicator, said, “I’m here.” 

No other words. 

I t was time to go back down and 
give Henry his chance, but I 
looked down the western slope be- 
fore I turned to go. 

The lady was winking again. Per- 
haps eight hundred feet below, the 
red light shone. Could that have 
been what I had seen from the town 
during the storm, on that night, so 
long ago? 

“I didn’t know and I had to. 

I spoke into the communicator. 
“How’s Mallardi doing?” 

“I just stood up,” he answered. 
“Give me another half hour, and 
I’m coming up myself.” 

“Henry,” I said. “Should he?” 
“Gotta take his word how he 
feels,” said Lanning. 

“Well,” I said, “then take it easy. 
I’ll be gone when you get here. I’m 
going a little way down the western 
side. Something I want to see.” 
“What?” 


THIS MORTAL MOUNTAIN 


63 



“I dunno. That’s why I want to 
see.” 

‘Take care.” 

“Check” 

The western slope was an easy 
descent. As I went down it, I 
realized that the light was coming 
from an opening in the side of the 
mountain. 

Half an hour later, I stood before 
it. 

I stepped within and was dazzled. 

I walked toward it and stopped. 
It pulsed and quivered and sang. 
A vibrating wall of flame leapt 
from the floor of the cave, towered 
to the roof of the cave. 

It blocked my way, when I wanted 
to go beyond it. 

She was there, and I wanted to 
reach her. 

I took a step forward, so that I 
was only inches away from it. My 
communicator was full of static and 
my arms of cold needles. 

It did not bend toward me, as 
to attack. It cast no heat. 

I stared through the veil of fires 
to where she reclined, her eyes 
closed, her breast unmoving. 

I stared at the bank of machinery 
beside the far wall. 

“I’m here,” I said, and I raised 
my pick. 

When its point touched the wall 
of flame someone took the lid off 
hell, and I staggered back, blinded. 
When my vision cleared, the angel 
stood before me. 

“ You may not pass here ” he said. 
“She is the reason you want me 
to go back?” I asked. 

“Yes. Go back** 


“Has she no say in the matter?” 
“She sleeps. Go back** 

“So I notice. Why?” 

“She must. Go back,** 

“Why did she herself appear to 
me and lead me strangely?” 

“I used up the fear-forms I knew. 
They did not work. I led you strange- 
ly because her sleeping mind touches 
upon my workings. It did so especial- 
ly when / borrowed her form , so that 
it interfered with the directive. Go 
back.” 

“What is the directive?” 

“She is to be guarded against all 
things coming up the mountain. Go 
back.*' 

“Why? Why is she guarded?” 
“She sleeps. Go back!* 

The conversation having become 
somewhat circular at that point, I 
reached into my pack and drew out 
the projector. I swung it forward and 
the angel melted. The flames bent 
away from my outstretched hand. I 
sought to open a doorway in the 
circle of fire. 

It worked, sort of. 

I pushed the projector forward, 
and the flames bent and bent and 
bent and finally broke. When they 
broke, I leaped forward. I made it 
through, but my protective suit was 
as scorched as Mallardi’s. 

I moved to the coffinlike locker 
within which she slept. 

I rested my hands on its edge and 
looked down. 

She was as fragile as ice. 

In fact, she was ice ... 

The machine came alive with 
lights then, and I felt her somber 
bedstead vibrate. 

Then I saw the man. 


64 


IF 



He was half sprawled across a 
metal chair beside the machine. 

He, too, was ice. Only his features 
were gray, were twisted. He wore 
black and he was dead and a statue, 
while she was sleeping and a statue. 

She wore blue, and white .... 

There was an empty casket in the 
far corner .... 

But something was happening 
around me. There came a brighten- 
ing of the air. Yes, it was air. It 
hissed upward from frosty jets in 
the floor, formed into great clouds. 
Then a feeling of heat occurred and 
the clouds began to fade and the 
brightening continued. 

I returned to the casket and 
studied her features. 

I wondered what her voice would 
sound like when/if she spoke. I 
wondered what lay within her mind. 
I wondered how her thinking work- 
ed, and what she liked and didn’t 
like. I wondered what her eyes had 
looked upon, and when. 

I wondered all these things, be- 
cause I could see that whatever 
forces I had set into operation when 
I entered the circle of fire were 
causing her, slowly, to cease being 
a statue. 

She was being awakened. 

I waited. Over an hour went by, 
and still I waited, watching her. 
She began to breathe. Her eyes 
opened at last, and for a long time 
she did not see. 

Then her bluefire fell upon me. 
“Whitey,” she said. 

“Yes.” 

“Where am I ... ?” 

“In the damnedest place I could 


possibly have found anyone.” 
She frowned. “I remember,” she 
said and tried to sit up. 

It didn’t work. She fell back. 
“What is your name?” 

“Linda,” she said. Then, “I 
dreamed of you, Whitey. Strange 
dreams .... How could that be?” 
“It’s tricky,” I said. 

“I knew you were coming,” she 
said. “I saw you fighting monsters 
on a mountain as high as the sky.” 
“Yes, we’re there now.” 

“H-have you the cure?” 

“Cure? What cure?” 

“Dawson’s Plague,” she said. 

I felt sick. I felt sick because I 
realized that she did not sleep as a 
prisoner, but to postpone her death. 
She was sick. 

“Did you come to live on this 
world in a ship that moved faster 
than light?” I asked. 

“No,” she said. “It took centuries 
to get here. We slept the cold sleep 
during the journey. This is one of 
the bunkers.” She gestured toward 
the casket with her eyes. I noticed 
her cheeks had become bright red. 

“They all began dying — of the 
plague,” she said. “There was no 
cure. My husband — Carl — is a 
doctor. When he saw that I had it, 
he said he would keep me in ex- 
treme hypothermia until a cure was 
found. Otherwise, you only live for 
two days, you know.” 

Then she stared up at me, and 
I realized that her last two words 
had been a question. 

I moved into a position to block 
her view of the dead man, who 
I feared must be her Carl. I tried 
to follow her husband’s thinking. 


THIS MORTAL MOUNTAIN

He'd had to hurry, as he was ob- 
viously further along than she had 
been. He knew the colony would 
be wiped out. He must have loved 
her and been awfully clever, both 
— awfully resourceful. Mostly, 
though, he must have loved her. 
Knowing that the colony would die, 
he knew it would be centuries be- 
fore another ship arrived. He had 
nothing that could power a cold 
bunker for that long. But up here, 
on the top of this mountain, almost 
as cold as outer space itself, power 
wouldn’t be necessary. Somehow, 
he had got Linda and the stuff up 
here. His machine cast a force 
field around the cave. Working in 
heat and atmosphere, he had sent 
her deep into the cold sleep and 
then prepared his own bunker. When 
he dropped the wall of forces, no 
power would be necessary to guaran- 
tee the long, icy wait. They could 
sleep for centuries within the bosom 
of the Gray Sister, protected by a 
colony of defense-computer. This 
last had apparently been program- 
med quickly, for he was dying. He 
saw that it was too late to join her. 
He hurried to set the thing for 
basic defense, killed the force field, 
and then went his way into that 
Dark and Secret Place. Thus it 
hurled its birds and its angels and 
its snakes, it raised its walls of 
fire -against me. He died, and it 
guarded her in her near-death — 
against everything, including those 
who would help. My coming to the 
mountain had activated it. My pass- 
ing of the defenses had caused her to 
be summoned back to life. 

“Go back!” I heard the machine 


say through its projected angel, for 
Henry had entered the cave. 

^7V/T y God!” I heard him say. 

1V1 who's that?” 

“Get Doc!” I said. “Hurry! I’ll 
explain later. It's a matter of life! 
Climb back to where your com- 
municator will work, and tell him 
it’s Dawson’s Plague — a bad local 
bug! Hurry!” 

“I’m on my way,” he said and 
was. 

“There is a doctor?” she asked. 

“Yes. Only about two hours away. 
Don’t worry .... I still don’t see 
how anyone could have gotten you 
up here to the top of this moun- 
tain, let alone a load of machines.” 

“We’re on the big mountain — the 
forty^miler?” 

“Yes.” 

“How did you get up?” she 
asked. 

“I climbed it.” 

“You really climbed Purgatorio? 
On the outside?” 

“Purgatorio? That’s what you call 
it? Yes, I climbed it, that way.” 

“We didn’t think it could be 
done.” 

“How else might one arrive at 
its top?” 

“It’s hollow inside,” she said. 
“There are great caves and massive 
passages. It’s easy to fly up the 
inside in a pressurized jet car. In 
fact, it was an amusement ride. Two 
and a half dollars per person. An 
hour and a half each way. A dollar 
to rent a pressurized suit and take 
an hour’s walk around the top. Nice 
way to spend an afternoon. Beautiful 
view . ?” She gasped deeply.

“I don’t feel so good,” she said. 
“Have you any water?” 

“Yes,” I said, and I gave her all 
I had. 

As she sipped it, I prayed that 
Doc had the necessary serum or else 
would be able to send her back to 
ice and sleep until it could be got- 
ten. I prayed that he would make 
good time, for two hours seemed 
long when measured against her 
thirst and the red of her flesh. 

“My fever is coming again,” she 
said. “Talk to me, Whitey, please 
. Tell me things. Keep me with 
you till he comes. I don’t want my 
mind to turn back upon what has 
happened . ” 

“What would you like me to tell 
you about, Linda?” 

“Tell me why you did it. Tell me 
what it was like, to climb a mountain 
like this one. Why?” 

I turned my mind back upon what 
had happened. 


“There is a certain madness in- 
volved,” I said, “a certain envy of 
great and powerful natural forces, 
that some men have. Each mountain 
is a deity, you know. Each is an 
immortal power. If you make sacri- 
fices upon its slopes, a mountain 
may grant you a certain grace, and 
for a time you will share this power. 
Perhaps that is why they call 
me . ” 

Her hand rested in mine. I hoped 
that through it whatever power I 
might contain would hold all of her 
with me for as long as ever possi- 
ble. 

“I remember the first time that I 
saw Purgatory, Linda,” I told her. 
“I looked at it and I was sick. I 
wondered, where did it lead . ?” 

(Stars. 

Oh let there be. 

This once to end with. 

Please.) 

“Stars?”

THIS MORTAL MOUNTAIN

IF * Short Story 



W hen the buzzer sounded I 
paused only to check my uni- 
form, then stepped through the door 
and threw the admiral a snappy sa- 
lute. As his orderly, that’s what I 
always do when he buzzes, even on 
the moon. Of course on the moon, 
with any weight carried up from 
Earth at a premium and the environ- 
ment controlled, the uniform isn’t 
much, even for an admiral’s orderly: 
briefs, duty belt, cap and boots; but 
I always give it a quick check any- 
way. The Old Man has the eyes of a 
hawk and the disposition of a bear 
trap. And there’s no sense in sitting 


on a bear trap if you don’t have to 
— it chews mighty deep. 

The admiral glanced up through 
those shaggy white eyebrows of his 
and nodded when I saluted. He didn’t 
answer the salute, of course. He was 
uncovered. “Christensen,” he said, 
“get me Jennings. On the double.” 

I saluted again and stepped back 
into the passageway. Things weren’t 
too bad. If I was in trouble with him, 
he called me Orderly. If everything 
was calm, he called me Corporal. 
On a few occasions when he was 
feeling extra good, he has called me 
Sven. When someone else is in trou- 


68 



ble, it's Corporal Christensen. And 
when his brain is just in high gear 
about something, it’s always just 
Christensen. 

Commander Jennings was skipper 
of the U.S.S.N.S. Tombaugh, the 
Space Navy ship that had brought 
Admiral Jones from Earth orbit to 
-the moon to clean up the war the 
hard way — sitting at one side of a 
conference table. Of course, the fact 
that Jennings’ job was done when he 
landed his ship at the Space Port, 
that he wouldn’t be on duty again un- 
til a few hours before teke-off was 
scheduled and that he didn’t even 
have to tell the duty officer where 
he was going didn’t cut any ice with 
the Old Man. He wanted Jennings, 
and it was my job as orderly to pro- 
duce him. 

W ell, I knew old Hot Shot — 
that’s Jennings’ name when he 
isn’t around — likes to play poker, 
and he likes to win. I also knew that 
he’s smart enough to know that he 
doesn’t play poker very well. So I 
called the number of the Fourth 
Regiment Advanced Base - — about 
twenty miles down the cover road 
- from the Main Highway toward the 
Red lines — and asked to speak to 
Commander Jennings. That outfit 
plays the lousiest brand of high 
• stakes poker on the moon. 

“The admiral’s compliments,” I 
translated, when they had coaxed Hot 
Shot to the ’phone, “and he re- 
quests that the commander call on 
him at his Headquarters at the com- 
mander’s earliest convenience.” In 
case you don’t translate as good as 
Hot Shot did, that means just what 


the admiral said: "on the double.” 
The admiral stood up when I an- 
nounced Commander Jennings a few 
minutes later and seemed to look 
down at him. That, by the way, is 
quite a trick, considering that the 
admiral is five foot six, and that’s 
four inches shorter than Hot Shot. 
The admiral didn’t wave me out, so 
I stood there looking down at Com- 
mander Jennings too, which is easy 
for me because I’ve got eight inches 
of height on him. 

Hie admiral sounded bitter. “It 
looks as if the Reds may just possibly 
be trying to give us a run around,” 
he said without any preliminaries. 
"Back on Earth they talk about be- 
ing anxious for peace negotiations, 
but it’s all pure propaganda. I’ve 
been up here on this God-forsaken 
ball for almost four weeks, and we 
haven’t even been able to agree on 
where to meet. Well, Hot Shot, I’m 
not going t© continue to sit still for 
it. Can you set your fire buggy down 
on the Main Highway, in the middle 
of that crossroads place where the 
Reds cut their road into it?” 

“Yes, sir,” said the pilot. ‘That’s 
a simple suborbital flight.” 

“That won’t do, and you know 
it,” growled the admiral. “They’d 
just shoot us down and apologize 
later. You’d have to stay under five 
hundred feet all the way.” 

1 almost caught myself nodding in 
in agreement. 

In the ten years we and the Reds 
had been fighting on the moon — 
which the longhairs said had, during 
most of that time, helped us all keep 
things peaceful down on Earth — 


MOONSHINE

anything lobbed anywhere around 
the moon on a ballistic trajectory, 
either orbitally or suborbitally, by 
either side, was automatically shot 
down. 

Except for ships coming in from 
Earth and landing at one of the two 
spaceports. Both sides let the big 
ships come and go, so they could 
bring in supplies to live and fight 
with. And take home the high-paid 
volunteers who didn’t reup when 
their time expired. Fighting men get 
high pay on the moon, unless they’re 
regulars like the admiral and me. 
And according to law, 1* hadn’t had 
to go with him to the moon, except 
I hadn’t had the guts to tell the Old 
Man good-by. 

It’s the low lunar gravity that 
makes it easy to shoot down even 
mortar shells; a big ship would have 
about the same chance of surviving 
— none at a!!. So, even though I’m 
not a Looney, I almost nodded. 

“Yes, sir,” said Hot Shot after 
fiddling for a few minutes with the 
slide rule he pulled out of the pouch 
sewn to his briefs. I noticed there 
was a good deal of green folding 
stuff crammed into the pouch, too. 
Leaving that game must really have 
hurt him. “I have enough control 
to drift right down the highway on 
the main engines and the fuel to get 
* there and back. Of course, we’ll have 
to clear off the traffic first to keep 
from scorching them with our jets.” 

“Good. I’ll exchange notes with 
the Muscovites for three more days. 
By that time I should have them 
boxed in so they won’t be able to 
avoid meeting me on neutral ground, 
providing they don’t think about a 


ship-to-ship meeting. What good that 
will do us, God only knows; but 
we’ll try to solve that when we come 
to it. 

“Sven,” he said, turning to me, 
“when my ship shows up at the cross- 
roads — you know the place — 
I’ll expect you to be there with a 
tube that will connect my airlock 
with theirs. You go off and get that 
attended to, and I don’t expect to 
see you until then. Take three days 
off; you’ve earned it.” 

“Aye, aye sir. And will the ad- 
miral have a requirement for a sub- 
stitute orderly? There is one of the 
soldier volunteers who would be able 
to handle the job for the admiral.” 

The Old Man glared at me 
through his eyebrows. “What’s to 
handle? You spend ninety percent of 
your time on your butt outside my 
door, and in this light gravity you’d 
even lose your callouses there, if I let 
you. At fifteen times what Uncle 
pays you, a volunteer for three days 
isn’t worth my trouble in trying to 
train him. Now get going, both of 
you.” 

I held the curtain aside for Hot 
Shot, saluted and left behind him. 
I knew why the admiral had given 
me three free days, and I didn’t like 
it. Oh, I liked the time off just fine. 
There was plenty of good use I 
could make of it; but I didn’t like 
the reason he had given it to me. 
The Old Man would deny it, but he’s 
superstitious. I wangled three days 
leave out of him way back when he 
was stuck on a solution for that 
Grombock affair, at the Polar sta- 
tion, and right after I got back from 
that, everything fell into place. And 


70 


IF 



the second time, on Guam; and the 
third time on the Orbital Station; 
each time he let me off for three 
days, he got the problem solved. 

You’d think he’d just get rid of 
me entirely, wouldn’t you? But like 
I said, he’s superstitious. It’s three 
days or nothing. And by letting me 
off, for those three days, he was 
saying that he didn’t have any more 
ideas than I did about how to handle 
the situation. And I didn’t have any, 
or care to have any. 

T aking care of the job he had as- 
signed me didn’t take much 
time, even though nobody was sure 
what ship the Russians would use 
or what size airlock it would have. 
I trotted over to the motor pool, 
still wearing my orderly belt and 
boots, and drew out a moon jeep. 
They tried to give me a little static 
about how tricky it is to drive on the 
moon, but I flashed my operator’s 
card — good for everything from a 
moonbug on up to a full-sized re- 
fuelling rig. I’d spent my first free 
time getting checked out and quali- 
fied — you never know what the 
Old Man will want. 

Then I picked up a pound of cof- 
fee from the admiral’s mess and 
went over to the Experimental De- 
vices Supply Center to draw out a 
gadget I knew about: a Tube, Uni- 
versal, Airlock Connector, Collapsi- 
ble, Sixty Foot, Experimental. I 
didn’t plan to sign a requisition, be- 
cause experimental devices can’t be 
drawn out officially by anybody but 
the longhairs. They’re supposed to 
be used only under carefully con- 
trolled conditions until approved for 


service applications. Even as it is, 
when one of their experimental giz- 
mos doesn’t pan out right, they 
sometimes have to scrape up bits of 
long-hair to find enough to bury. 

This one worked right, even 
though the longhairs hadn’t found 
it out yet. One of the supply serge- 
ants was named Sally — one of not 
too many female volunteer soldiers 
on the moon. Of course, I didn’t 
make enough money even to think 
about her, but she made plenty and 
was tired of volunteers. She was real 
interested in a professional in a 
Marine uniform — even a moon- 
style Marine uniform — and had no 
objections to my being six foot six. 

My size did turn out to be a dis- 
advantage in any of the moon bug- 
gies, though — their cabins are all 
cramped — so we had loaded the 
experimental Airlock Connector on a 
jeep, ran it up a canyon, connected 
one end of it to one door of the jeep 
and the other to the other door, 
pumped in air and used that for 
getting better acquainted. So I knew 
the tube would do the trick. It fits 
most any size of door or airlock. 

As it turned out, I didn’t need 
the coffee. Sally was on duty, but 
just going off. So we gave the tube 
one more test, and then, after I 
stowed the thing in the jeep and 
dropped Sally off at the WALAC 
barracks — carefully patrolled to 
keep the men out and the girls safe 
— I was on my. own with plenty of 
time to spare. 

B ecause of the problems of living 
on a Marine corporal’s pay, I 
usually try to have some small ad- 


MOONSHINE 


71 



ditional source of picking up a little 
of the long green wherever I go. 
Normally, a deck of cards and a little 
game with a bunch of boots can turn 
a tidy profit, but on the moon that 
was out. When even Hot Shot could 
win a pouchful, I wasn’t worried 
about being outclassed; I just didn’t 
have enough scratch for the initial 
stake. 

There was one great universal 
need that was in even shorter supply 
on the moon than girls: drinking 
liquor. Like I said before, it costs a 
great deal of money to ship any- 
thing from Earth. Liquor never man- 
aged to get very high on the priority 
lists because the bureaucrats made 
up the priority lists, and they never 
went to the moon. There was some 
for the officers, of course, but most 
of the men on the moon weren’t 
officers, even if their pay was a lot 
higher than officers get, Earthside. 

So, as soon as I got to the moon, 
this corporal decided to engage in 
a little private enterprise to fill the 
need. I should have realized that 
with all the demand, there would 
have been plenty of stills and boot- 
leggers on the moon filling it, unless 
there was some good reason to pre- 
vent it. And I don’t mean the law. 
M.P.’s like a snort now and then, 
too. 

The trouble was raw materials. 
The moon doesn’t have any, of 
course. Usually, you start with some 
letft-over stuff and ferment it and 
then run it through a still. And I 
couldn’t get my hands on any left- 
over stuff, like potato peels or raisins 
or overripe fruit or (anything that 
I’ve used in the past. Dehydrated 


and preprepared foods are efficient 
for shipping to the moon, I suppose, 
but they’re hell on private enter- 
prise. 

I managed to scrounge some raw* 
materials from the admiral’s mess 
and the officers’ messes’. Net really 
left overs, just some food that 
wouldn’t be missed on the records.. 
And either those stewards were real 
thirsty, or they are expert gougers; 
they made me promise them so much 
of my initial output, that there 
wasn’t much left for profit, especial- 
ly after I allowed a little for me and 
Sally. 

The still was easy to rig, of 
course. A ready-made vacuum and 
the sun up a couple of weeks at a 
time for power (with extra suit-bat- 
teries for use during the night time) 
made the production part of the job 
real simple. 

I made my headquarters in a little 
cave, well off the beaten track. Be- 
fore I got my three-days-off, I’d had 
time to brew up a batch and run it 
through my distilling apparatus. Cut 
back to about 90 proof — I’m an 
honest man — moon juice tasted 
very good to me and Sally. And I 
didn’t get any complaints from the 
stewards either. But after finishing 
with a little lubrication for the M.P.’s 
and the Masters -at- Arms and such, 
there hadn’t been any out of that 
first batch to sell, and I hadn’t been 
able to pick up nearly as many raw 
materials for a second hatch as I 
would have liked. Still, I’d dumped 
my old load of used mash at the 
back of the cave and had reloaded 
my brew vat with what I had. 

Since this was my profit run and 


72 


IF 



I was anxious about it, the first thing 
I did when I left Sally with the 
moon jeep was to hustle over to the 
cave to see how my stuff was mak- 
ing out. 

A t first, I couldn’t even find the 
cave. After 1 drove past where 
the entrance ought to be a couple of 
times, I stopped the jeep, checked 
my suit and got out to walk and 
hunt. It wasn’t until I got right up 
to the rock face that I found that 
the cave was still there. It was just 
idl full of something — full to over- 
flowing. Whatever it was, the stuff 
bulged out of the cave until it reach- 
ed a place where the rays of the 
sun had hit it, I guess, earlier in the 
“morning,” and that had stopped it. 

Have you ever heard of “moon- 
wort?” Everybody has, I suppose. 
It’s the only living thing they have 
found on the moon so far, except 
soldiers, and the papers and maga- 
zines have given it a big play. At 
any rate, it isn’t exactly a plant, but 
it certainly isn’t an animal; and it 
has only been found in a few places 
in caves where the sun can’t hit it 
directly, and it’s almost too small to 
see with the naked eye. 

Well, I had seen some moonwort 
through a microscope, and this was 
it, only a good many thousands of 
times bigger. No plant was going to 
keep me from my still, even if moon- 
wort isn’t exactly a plant. So I pulled 
some of it aside and trampled some 
more of it down and worked my 
way in to see how my mash was 
making out. 

The longhairs tell me that my 
rough treatment of the moonwort 


was one of the dumbest things I’ve 
ever done. They say that I hod no 
way of telling how delicate that 
stuff — they simplify their words for 
it to “Hypertrophied mooewert” 
when they talk to me — might be, 
and that all of it might just have 
curled up and died. They say that I 
should have stayed away from it and 
called in experts like them to handle 
it properly. 

Oh, yes; they also add that moon- 
wort might, for all I knew, have 
been able to dissolve my space suit. 
Since that wouldn’t have helped my 
future plans at all, I’m glad that it 
turned out to be harmless and hardy 
after all. It speaks a lot for the long- 
hairs that they mentioned that pos- 
sibility about what might have hap- 
pened to me, even as an afterthought. 
I love them too. 

At any rate, my quarter of a vat 
of mash hadn’t been doing at all 
well. I guess the moonwort had cut 
the light. Not direct sunlight, of 
course, but reflected light. At this 
time of day, the cave should have 
been quite bright, and that’s what 
the mash needed, maybe, to help it 
work. 

I beat my way to the back of the 
cave, trampling the heavy growth 
down as much as I could as I went, 
and found that the whole mass of 
the moonwort seemed to be spring- 
ing out of the old mash that I’d 
dumped out of the vat after I’d fin- 
ished the first batch. The moonwort 
couldn’t have just used the old mash 
for food — it must have weighed 
many times as much as the mash. 
The longhairs talk about e&zymitic 
action and catalytic action a®d a lot 


MOONSHtNE 


73 



of other actions I don't care much 
about. All I knew at the time as I 
was mad because I figured the moon- 
wort was eating into my profits. 

A nd then I got an idea that again 
the longhairs have told me 
wasn’t very bright. The moonwort 
had grown on my used-up mash. I 
wondered if maybe I could ferment 
it in my vat. So I tried it. 

Never in my life have I seen any- 
thing work as fast as that moonwort 
mash did. In just a few hours I was 
as busy as a drill sergeant. I was 
working my still all out, making a 
clear white panther juice and using 
any spare time to cut more moon- 
wort and cram it into the vat. 

I had to make a couple of trips 
back to civilization to pick up more 
containers. I didn’t even stop to cut 
my output back to normal drinking 
proof — that was real high-test stuff. 

I was so busy I didn’t even stop to 
sip. 

As a matter of fact, maybe deep 
down inside I was scared that my 
panther juice might not be worth 
drinking. With all that hooch, I was 
as good as rich; if it turned out to 
be bad, I was just a poor corporal 
again. Anyway, I didn’t taste, and 
as far as I can remember, I didn’t 
even think about tasting. I just end- 
ed up with a jeep loaded full of high- 
test, but untested liquor — or what 
I hoped was liquor. I even had to 
move the tube outside of the vehicle 
and strap it on top to make room 
for my jugs. 

I remembered the Old Man’s or- 
ders, though. That’s something I 
don’t forget. And I was on hand on 


time to watch his ship come bounc- 
ing in on a tail of fire and set down 
right in the middle of the cross- 
roads, as advertised. 

I turned the Tube, Experimental, 
over to the crewmen of the flagship, 
making sure that they didn’t catch 
sight of my private enterprise, and 
reported to the admiral. 

“The Bolshies will be along in a 
few minutes,” he said, “for what- 
ever good that will do. They’re 
bringing a connector tube also, which 
they will hook to their airlock. Then 
we’ll attach the two tubes together, 
and meet there at the junction. 

“You’ll bring a table and a chair 
for me, and the rest of our delega- 
tion will bring their own chairs. The 
other side will bring their table and 
chairs too. At least, we’ll be able to 
do a little face-to-face talking, after 
all this time.” 

He looked at me. “The full 
Marine dress uniform is an impres- 
sive piece of gear,” he said. “Wear 
it during the meeting.” The Old 
Man knew that we had only been 
allowed to lift from Earth with a 
few pounds of personal belongings, 
and he knew that the Marine uni- 
form is heavy, and he knew that it 
wasn’t on the allowed list of what 
you can take to the moon. But he 
didn’t even bother to ask if I had 
a dress uniform with my gear in the 
ship. 

So I took a Marine bath (water 
is a scarce item in a spaceship), 
spit shined my shoes and put on my 
dress uniform. 

A long about that time, their ship 
came lumbering up and wobbled 


74 


IF 



to a stop not moie than fifty feet 
liom ours, in almost no time, they 
had men out of their ship in space- 
suits hooking a tube to their air- 
lock. Since our sailors had already 
finished their outside work, they 
just stood by and watched critically. 
Those Russians were pretty good, 
though, and in about fifteen min- 
utes from the time they landed, the 
two tubes were hooked together and 
i was walking toward the joining 
point on the inside, carrying an eight- 
foot-long table — the longest that 
could be set down crosswise in the 
tube — and an arm chair, just a few 
steps ahead of our delegation. 

I was glad to see that the Russian 
orderly fellow who was walking 
down their tube toward me carrying 
the table for their delegation was 
only about six foot four and didn’t 
have any where near as good a uni- 
form as my Marine full dress. But 
he was strong. He walked along 
carrying his table and chair as if it 
were the easiest thing to do in the 
world, just like I was carrying mine. 
We both knew the other one was 
lying. Even in light moon gravity, 
carrying that stuff was rough. 

I would have liked to have smiled 
at him to show I knew he was fak- 
ing, but that wouldn’t have been 
right; so each of us acted as if the 
other one weren’t there, except that 
we set our tables down at exactly 
the same time, so that they both 
stood side to side across the mouth 
of the tubes, touching each other all 
along the side so they made one big, 
square table. 


With the table in place, I set the 
arm chair down behind it, so that the 
admiral, without waiting at all, 
seated himself at the center spot on 
his side. At the same instant, the 
Russian general who was their chief 
negotiator seated himself at the cen- 
ter spot behind his table. The inter- 
preters and recorders and such took 
their places on both sides, and talk 
was ready to begin. 

Of course, the Old Man spoke ex- 
cellent Russian, though he wasn’t 
about to say a word in it, and I felt 
sure that the Russian general spoke 
good English, although you wouldn’t 
be able to tell it by listening to him. 
I stood a few steps behind the ad- 
miral at parade rest and didn’t move 
a muscle, while the interpreters 
cleared their throats and got things 
going. And the Russian orderly didn’t 
budge any more than I did. That 
boy really knew his stuff. 

Unfortunately, when the talking 
really got started, it soon became 
very obvious that the negotiations 
weren’t getting anywhere. After 
several years of continuous hot and 
cold war between East and West — 
hot on the moon, while both sides 
kept things reasonably peaceful 
down on Earth — the West had de- 
cided that the moon had stopped 
being a kind of relief valve for ex- 
plosive tempers, and it was time to 
stop the shooting. One of the big- 
shot commentators said that he and 
the statesmen of the capitals of the 
West figured that “continuation of 
the endemic lunar conflict had be- 
come contraindicated, because it had 
commenced merely to exacerbate 
feelings on both sides.” Whatever 


MOONSHINE 


75 



that means. Anyway, it looked as if 
the Russians didn’t agree with that 
commentator, whatever their polici- 
cians were saying back on Earth. 

T l he Old Man was keeping his 
temper, which was a wonder, be- 
cause I was losing mine. I man- 
aged to hold my position at parade 
rest without moving, of course, and 
I kept my face expressionless (or 
rather, in the proper expression of 
respectful readiness and attention 
that I can hold even when I have 
a hangover); but I couldn’t keep the 
angry blood from darkening my face 
and neck, and that made me flush 
even worse. I could tell that that 
damn Russian orderly was laughing 
at me behind his expression of re- 
spectful readiness and attention. 

What the Russians were doing was 
to try to make us break off the nego- 
tiations; and, of course, we just had 
to stay there patiently to prevent 
that-or to try to build up a situation 
where they would break things up 
by leaving in a huff and claiming 
that it was our fault and that we had 
forced them out. It was this that the 
admiral was trying to prevent, and 
he was good at it; but I kept wonder- 
ing just how long he could keep it 
up and what good it was doing. 

After several hours, the Russian 
general called a pause for what he 
said was “an exchange of courtesies.” 
The admiral looked worried, even 
though he didn’t change expression. 
The general gestured, and his order- 
ly snapped to attention. He motion- 
ed again, and the orderly pivoted 
and moved back through their tube 
and into the Russian ship. He came 


back a few minutes iaicr with two 
glasses and a bottle. 

The general commented that the 
liquor was vodka, the Russian na- 
tional drink. He poured and pro- 
posed toasts to the Russian people 
and the people of the West and to 
the success of the conference. Then, 
when both glasses were empty he 
gestured again, and that orderly of 
his picked up the bottle and the 
glasses and stepped back. 

The admiral had seen what was 
coming. It was obvious that if he 
couldn’t propose adequate answering 
toasts, now that his turn had come, 
the Russians would get mad and 
stalk off, talking about our discour- 
tesy. I had watched the Old Man 
glance at his aide and raise one eye- 
brow a trifle, and I had seen the 
aide shake his head an eighth of an 
inch each way. 

U.S.S.N.S. Tombaugh was a com- 
missioned Navy ship, and the Jose- 
phus Daniels rule applied: no 

liquor allowed. Of course, sometimes 
a little private stock gets hidden on 
board for use ashore, but if there had 
been any, the aide would have 
known about it — and it was clear 
that there wasn’t. 

I was nearly sweating because I 
had the answer in the moon jeep, 
and I couldn’t move a muscle to let 
the admiral know about it. I needn’t 
have worried. The admiral gestured, 
and I snapped to attention. He mo- 
tioned again, and I pivoted and 
moved back through the tube and 
into the ship. 

I whipped out of my dress uni- 
form, into a spacesuit, out of the 
auxiliary airlock, into the moon jeep 


76 


IF 



for a jug, back into the ship, out 
of the spacesuit an d back into my 
uniform in just under four minutes. 
Meanwhile, at my frantic request on 
the way by, a tray and a couple of 
glasses had been gotten ready. 

W hen I stepped back into the 
tube, my uniform was as im- 
maculate as before, and I wasn’t 
even breathing heavily, although the 
effort almost made me blow a gasket. 

The admiral picked up the jug 
and poured the two glasses full of 
the dear white liquid — as clear 
and white as vodka. He glanced at 
the jug and then at me and stated 
blandly that the liquor was Moon- 
shine, the American national drink. 

He proposed an appropriate toast, 
and he and the disappointed general 
oeremonially tossed down their neat 
shots. I stood at rest and prayed. 

The general didn’t say a word, 
which didn’t surprise me. He just 
held out his glass, which did. The 
admiral filled it again, and his own, 
and they tossed down their second 
slugs. Then both the general and 
the admiral gestured simultaneously, 
and we popped to attention, simul- 
taneously. 

I got a bunch of glasses, enough 
for all of the group on our side, 
and then grabbed enough for the 
other side too and was back in thirty 
seconds. 

The general had his arm around 
his rigid and apoplectic orderly, 
happily explaining that he wanted 
him to get some glasses so that 
everybody, including the orderly, 
would have some of this wonderful 
American Moonshine. 


Of course, a couple of hours later 
the authorities moved in and con- 
fiscated my entire jeepload full of 
liquor, but it had already done its 
work. There have been half a dozen 
Nobel prizes, including a Peace 
Prize, awarded to longhairs who 
have studied the stuff and explained 
why it works the way it does and 
how they have expanded the world’s 
fund of knowledge. 

The stuff just does what any good 
booze has always been supposed to 
do. It makes people friendly. 

The admiral and the general had 
come to full agreement in fifteen 
minutes on ending the war on the 
moon and had exercised their pleni- 
potentiary powers to sign the agree- 
ment in front of full live network 
television coverage beamed down to 
both sides on Earth. The agreement 
was so sensible that both sides have 
had to stick with it. 

Nobody has ever used any more 
of the genuine Moonshine at a con- 
ference; but the fact that it exists 
and that it might be used has made 
the world a lot more peaceful. Even 
labor-management negotiations are 
running smoother. The world is get- 
ting downright insipid. 

The admiral got a fancy medal, 
which I keep polished, the thanks 
of the world and a promotion. 

As for me. I’ve never tasted the 
stuff, and I’m not going to. I pick 
my own friends. It may be the uni- 
form, but I don’t have much trouble 
getting real friendly when I want to 
with whatever girl I want to. And 
what else would I need the genuine 
Moonshine for? After all, I’m a 
Marine. END

I 

T 'he most beautiful girl aboard 
turned out to have a husband 
with habits so solitary that I didn’t 
know about him until the second 
week. He was about five feet four 
and middle-aged, but he wore a 
hellflare tattoo on his shoulder, 
which meant he’d been on Kzin dur- 
ing the war thirty years back, which 
meant he’d been trained to kill adult 
kzinti with his bare hands, feet el- 
bows, knees and whatnot. When we 
found out about each other he very 




78 


decently gave me a first warning, 
and broke my arm to prove he 
meant it. 

The arm still ached a day later, 
and every woman on the Lensman 
was over two hundred years old. I 
drank alone. I stared glumly into 
the mirror behind the curving bar. 
The mirror stared glumly back. 

“Hey. You from We Made It. 
What am I?” 

He was two chairs down, and he 
was glaring. Without the beard he 
would have had a round, almost 
petulant face ... I think. The beard, 
short and black and carefully shaped, 
made him look like a cross between 
Zeus and an angry bulldog. The glare 
went with the beard. His square 
fingers wrapped a large drinking 
bulb in a death grip. A broad belly 
matched broad shoulders to make 
him look massive rather than fat. 

Obviously he was talking to me. I 
asked, “What do you mean, what 
are you?” 

“Where am I from?” 

“Earth.” It was obvious. The ac- 
cent said Earth. So did the conser- 
vatively symmetrical beard. His 
breathing was unconsciously natural 
in the ship’s standard atmosphere, 
and his build had been forged at one 
point zero gee. 

“Then what am I?” 

“A flatlander.” 

The glare heat increased. He’d ob- 
viously reached the bar way ahead 
of me. “A flatlander! Dammit, 
everywhere I go I’m a flatlander. Do 
you know how many hours I’ve spent 
in space?” 

“No. Long enough to know how 
to use a drinking bulb.” 


“Funny. Very funny. Everywhere 
in human space a flatlander is a 
shnook who never gets above the at- 
mosphere. Everywhere but Earth. If 
you’re from Earth you’re a flat- 
lander all your life. For the last fifty 
years I’ve been running about in 
human space, and what am I? A 
flatlander. Why?” 

“Earthian is a clumsy term.” 
“What is WeMadeltian?” he de- 
manded. 

“I’m a crashlander. I wasn’t born 
within fifty miles of Crashlanding 
City, but I’m a crashlander anyway.” 
That got a grin. I think. It was 
hard to tell with the beard. “Lucky 
you’re not a pilot.” 

“I am. Was.” 

“You’re kidding. They let a 
crashlander pilot a ship?” 

“If he’s good at it.” 

“I didn’t mean to pique your ire, 
sir. May I introduce myself? My 
name’s Elephant.” 

“Beowulf Shaeffer.” 

He bought me a drink. I bought 
him a drink. It turned out we both 
played gin, so we took fresh drinks 
to a card table .... 

W hen I was a kid I used to stand 
out at the edge of Crashland- 
ing Port watching the ships come in. 
I’d watch the mob of passengers 
leave the lock and move in a great 
clump toward customs, and I’d won- 
der why they seemed to have trou- 
ble navigating. A majority of the 
starborn would always walk in weav- 
ing lines, swaying and blinking teary 
eyes against the sun. I used to think 
it was because they came from dif- 
ferent worlds with different gravities 


FLATLANDER 


79 



and different atmospheres beneath 
differently colored suns. 

Later I learned different 

There are no windows in a pas- 
senger spacecraft M there were, half 
the passengers would go insane; it 
takes an unusual mentality to watch 
the blind-spot appearance of hyper- 
space and still keep one’s marbles. 
For passengers there is nothing to 
watch and nothing to do, and if you 
don’t like reading sixteen hours a 
day then you drink. It’s best to drink 
in company. You get less lushed, 
knowing you have to keep up your 
side of a conversation. The ship’s 
’doc has cured more hangovers than 
every other operation combined, 
right down to manicures and hair- 
cuts. 

The ship grounded at Los An- 
geles two days after I met Elephant. 
He’d made a good drinking partner. 
We’d been fairly matched at cards, 
him with his sharp card sense, me 
with my usual luck. From the talk- 
ing we’d done we knew almost as 
much about each other as anyone 
knows about anyone. In a way I 
was sorry to see him leave. 

“You’ve got my number?” 

“Yah. But, like I said, I don’t 
know just what I’ll be doing.” I was 
telling the truth. When I explore a 
civilized world I like to make my 
own discoveries. 

“Well, call me if you get a chance. 
I wish you’d change your mind. I’d 
really like to show you something of 
Earth.” 

“I decline with thanks. Good-by, 
Elephant, it’s been fun.” 

Elephant waved and turned 
through the natives’ door. I went on 


to face the smuggler baiters. The last 
drink was still with me, but I could 
core that at the hotel. I never ex- 
pected te see Elephant again. I really 
never did. 

N ine days ago I’d been on Jinx, 
I’d been rich. And I’d been de- 
pressed. 

The money and the depression had 
stemmed from the same source. The 
puppeteers, those three-legged, two- 
headed professional cowards and 
businessmen, had lured me into 
taking a new type of ship all the way 
to the galactic core, thirty thousand 
light-years away. The trip was for 
publicity purposes, to get research 
money to iron out the imperfections 
in the very ship I was riding. 

I suppose I should have had more 
sense, but I never do, and the money 
was good. The trouble was that the 
Core had exploded by the time I got 
there. The Core stars had gone off 
in a chain reaction of novas ten 
thousand years ago, and a wave of 
radiation was even then (and even 
now) sweeping methodically toward 
known space. 

In just over twenty thousand 
years, we’ll all find ourselves in 
deadly danger. 

You’re not worried? It didn’t 
bother me much either. But every 
puppeteer in known space vanished 
overnight, heading for Finagle knows 
what other galaxy. 

I was depressed. I missed the pup- 
peteers and hated knowing I was 
responsible for their going. I had 
time, and money, and a black melan- 
cholia to work off. And I’d always 
wanted to see Earth.

E arth smelled good. There was a 
used flavor to it, a breathed 
flavor, unlike anything I’ve ever 
known. It was the difference be- 
tween spring water and distilled 
water. Somewhere in each breath I 
took were molecules breathed by 
Dante, Aristotle, Shakespeare, Hein- 
ledn, Carter and my own ancestors. 
Traces of past industries lingered in 
the air, sensed if not smelled: gaso- 
line, coal fumes, tobacco and burnt 
cigarette filters, diesel fumes, ale 
breweries. I left the customs house 
with inflated lungs and a questioning 
look. 

I could have taken a transfer booth 
straight to the hotel. I decided to 
walk a little first. 

Everyone on Earth had made the 
same decision. 

The pedwalk held a crowd such as 
I had never imagined. They were all 
shapes and all colors, and they 
dressed in strange and eldritch ways. 
Shifting colors assaulted the eye and 
sent one reeling. On any world in 
human space, any world but one, 
you know immediately who the na- 
tives are. Wunderland? Asymmetric 
beards mark the nobility, and the 
common people are the ones who 
quickly step out of their way. We 
Made It? The pallor of our skins in 
summer and winter; in spring and 
fall, the fact that we all race up- 
stairs, above the buried cities and 
onto the blooming desert, eager to 
taste sunlight while the murderous 
winds are at rest. Jinx? The natives 
are short and wide and strong; a 
sweet little old lady’s handshake can 


crush steel. Even in the Belt, within 
the solar system, a Belter strip hair- 
cut adorns both men and women. 
But Earth — ! 

No two looked alike. There were 
reds and blues and greens, yellows 
and oranges, plaids and stripes. I’m 
talking about hair, you understand, 
and skin. All my life I’ve used tannin 
secretion pills for protection against 
ultraviolet, so that my skin color has 
varied from its normal pinkish-white 
(I’m an albino) to (under bluewhite 
stars) tuxedo black. But I’d never 
known that other skin dye pills ex- 
isted. I stood rooted to the pedwalk, 
letting it carry me where it would, 
watching the incredible crowd swarm 
around me. They were all knees and 
elbows. Tomorrow I’d have bruises. 

“Hey!” 

The girl was four or five heads 
away, and short. I’d never have seen 
her if everyone else hadn’t been short 
too. Flatlanders rarely top six feet. 
And there was this girl, her hair a 
topological explosion in swirling 
orange and silver, her face a faint, 
subtle green with space-black eye- 
brows and lipstick, waving something 
and shouting at me. 

Waving my wallet. 

I forced my way .to her, until we 
were close enough to touch, until I 
could hear what she was saying 
above the crowd noise. 

“Stupid! Where’s your address? 
You don’t even have a place for a 
stamp!” 

“What?” 

She looked startled. “Oh! You’re 
an offworlder.” 

“Yah!” My voice would give out 
fast at this noise level. 


FLATLANDER 


81 



“Well, look.” She shoved her way 
closer to me. “Look, you can’t go 
around town with an offworldder’s 
wallet. Next time someone picks your 
pocket he may not notice ’till you’re 
gone.” 

“You picked my pocket?” 

“Sure! Think I found it? Would I 
risk my precious hand under all those 
spike heels?” 

“How if I call a cop?” 

“Cop? Oh, a stoneface.” She 
laughed merrily. “Learn or go under, 
man. There’s no law against picking 
pockets. Look around you.” 

I looked around me, then looked 
back fast, afraid she’d disappear. 
Not only my cash, but my Bank of 
Jinx draft for forty thousand stars, 
was in that wallet. Everything I 
owned. 

“See them all? Sixty-four million 
people in Los Angeles alone. Eight- 
een billion in the whole world. Sup- 
pose there was a law against picking 
pockets? How would you enforce it?” 
She deftly extracted the cash from 
my wallet and handed the wallet 
back. “Get yourself a new wallet, 
and fast. It’ll have a place for your 
address and a window for a tenth- 
star stamp. Put your address in right 
away, and a stamp too. Then the 
next guy who takes it can pull out 
the money and drop your wallet in 
the nearest mailbox, no sweat. Other- 
wise you lose your credit cards, your 
ident, everything.” She stuffed two 
hundred odd stars in cash between 
her breasts, flashed me a parting 
smile as she turned. 

“Thanks,” I called. Yes, I did. I 
was still bewildered, but she’d ob- 
viously stayed to help me. She could 

82 


just as easily have kept wallet and 
all. 

“No charge,” she called back, and 
was gone. 

I stopped off at the first transfer 
booth I saw, dropped a halfstar in 
the coin slot and dialed Elephant. 


T he vestibule was intimidating. 

I’d expected a vestibule. Why put 
a transfer booth inside your own 
home, where any burglar can get in 
just by dialing your number? Any- 
one who can afford the lease on a 
private transfer booth can also af- 
ford a vestibule with a locked door 
and an intercom switch. 

There was a vestibule, but it was 
the size of a living room, furnished 
with massage chairs and an autoven- 
dor. There was an intercom, but it 
was a flat vidphone, three hundred 





IF 






years old restored at perhaps a hun- 
dred times its original cost. There 
was a double door of what looked 
like polished brass, with two enor- 
mous carved handles, and it stood 
fifteen feet high. 

I’d suspected Elephant was well 
off, but this was too much. It oc- 
curred to me that I’d never seen him 
completely sober, that I had in fact 
turned down his offer of guide, that 
a simple morning-after treatment 
might have wiped me from his 
memory. Shouldn’t I just go away? I 
had wanted to explore Earth on my 
own. 

But I didn’t know the rules! 

I stepped out of the booth and 
glimpsed the back wall. It was all 
picture window, with nothing out- 
side. Just fleecy blue sky. How pecu- 
liar, I thought, and stepped closer. 


FLATLANDER 


83 



Elephant lived halfway up a cliff. 
A sheer mile-high cliff. 

The phone rang. 

On the third ear-jarring ring I 
answered, mainly to stop the noise. A 
supercilious voice said, “Is somebody 
out there?” 

‘Tm afraid not,” I said. “Does 
someone named Elephant live here?” 

“1*11 see, sir,” said the voice. The 
screen had not lit, but I had the 
feeling someone had seen me quite 
clearly. 

Seconds crawled by. I was half 
minded to jump back in the trans- 
fer booth and dial at random. But 
only half; that was the trouble. Then 
the screen did light, and it was 
Elephant. “Bay! You changed your 
mind!” 


“Yah. You didn’t tell me you 
were rich.” 

. “You didn’t ask.” 

“Well, no, of course not.” 

“How do you expect to learn 
things if you don’t ask? Don’t answer 
that. Hang on, I’ll be right down. 
You did change your mind? You’ll 
let me show you Earth?” 

“Yes, I will. I’m scared to go out 
there alone.” 


“Why? Don’t answer. Tell me in 
person.” He hung up. 

Seconds later the big bronze doors 
swung back with a bone-shaking 
boom. They just barely got out of 
Elephiant’s way. He pulled me inside, 
giving me no time to gape, shoved 
a drink in my hand and asked me 
why I was afraid to go outside. 

I told him about the pickpocket, 
and he laughed. He told me about 
the time he tried to go outside during 
a We Made It summer, and I laugh- 


ed, though I’ve heard of outworlders 
being blown away and to Hades do- 
ing the same thing. Amazingly, we 
were off again. It was just like on 
the ship, even to the end of Ele- 
phant’s anecdote. “They called me a 
silly flatlander, of course.” 

“I’ve been thinking about that,” 
I said. 

“About what?” 

“You said you’d give a lot to do 
something completely original, so the 
next time someone called you a flat- 
lander you oould back him into a 
corner and force him to listen to 
your story. You said it several times.” 
“I didn’t say just that. But I would 
like to have some story to tell, 
something like your neutron star epi- 
sode. If only to tell myself. The silly 
offworlder wouldn’t know, but Id 
know.” 

1 nodded. The neutron star episode 
he was talking about had been 
my first meeting with a puppeteer. 
The puppeteer had blackmailed me 
into taking one of his ships, a ship 
with an invulnerable puppeteer-made 
General Products hull, into a hyper- 
bolic orbit within one mile of the 
surface of a neutron star. It was 
the only neutron star ever found, 
and I was the second man to make 
that trip. The first, with his wife, 
had used the same type of ship. They 
were found crushed shapelessly into 
its nose by some unknown force. 
Danger does wonderful things for my 
well known mental laziness. With two 
minutes to spare I had realized what 
the unknown force was, and had 
crawled into the repair access tube 
to avoid it. I’d talked about it over 


84 


IF 



gin cards — a habit I’ve developed 
for distracting my opponent — and 
Elephant had been suitably impress- 
ed. 

“I’ve thought of a couple of things 
you could do,” I said. 

“Spill.” 

“One. Visit the puppeteer home 
world. Nobody’s been there, but 
everyone knows there is one, and 
everyone knows how difficult it is to 
find. You could be the finst.” 
“Great.” He mused a moment. 
“Great! And the puppeteers wouldn’t 
stop me because they’re gone. Where 
is the puppeteer home world?” 

“/ don’t know.” 

“What’s your second idea?” 

“Ask the Outsiders.” 

“Huh?” 

“There’s not a system in the galaxy 
that the Outsiders don’t know all 
about. We don’t know how far the 
puppeteer empire extended, though 
it was ’way beyond known space, but 
we do know about the Outsiders. 
They know the galaxy like the palm 
of their — uh . And they trade 
for information; it’s just about the 
only business they do. Ask them 
what’s the most unusual world they 
know of within reach.” 

Elephant was nodding gently. 
There was a glazed look in his eyes. 
I had not been sure he was serious 
about seeking some unique achieve- 
ment. He was. 

“The problem is,” I said, “that an 
Outsider’s idea of what is unique 
may not — ” I stopped, because Ele- 
phant was up and half-running to a 
tridphone. 

I wasn’t sorry. It gave me an op- 
portunity to gape in private. 


I’ve been in bigger homes than 
Elephant’s. Mach bigger. I grew up 
in one. But Fve never seen a room 
that soothed the eye like Elephant’s 
living room. It was more than a 
living room; it was an optical illu- 
sion, the opposite of those jittering 
black-and-white images they show in 
lectures on how we see. These clini- 
cal children of Op Art give the illu- 
sion of motion; but Elephant’s living 
room gave the illusion of stillness. A 
physicist would have loved the 
soundproofing. Some interior deco- 
rator had become famous for his 
work here, if he hadn’t been famous 
already, in which case he had become 
rich. How could tall, thin Beowulf 
Shaeffer fit a chair designed to the 
measure of short, wide Elephant? Yet 
I was bonelessly limp, blissfully re- 
laxed, using only the muscles that 
held a double- walled glass of an odd- 
tasting, strangely refreshing soft 
drink called Tzlotz Beer. 

A glass which would not empty. 
Somewhere in the crystal was a tiny 
transfer motor connected to the bar; 
but the bent light in the crystal hid 
it. Another optical illusion, and one 
that must have tricked good men in- 
to acute alcoholism. I’d have to 
watch that. 

E lephant returned. He walked as 
if he massed tons, as if any 
kzin foolish enough to stand in his 
path would have a short, wide hole 
in him. “All done,” he said. “Don 
Cramer’ll find the nearest Outsider 
ship and make my pitch for me. We 
should hear in a couple of days.” 
“Okay,” said I, and asked him 
about the cliff. It turned out that 


FLATLANDER 


85 



we were in the Rocky Mountains 
and that he owned every square inch 
of the nearly vertical cliff face. Why? 
I remembered Earth’s eighteen bil- 
lion and wondered if they’d other- 
wise have surrounded him up, down, 
and sideways. 

Suddenly Elephant remembered 
that someone named Dianna must 
be home by now. I followed him 
into the transfer booth, watched him 
dial eleven digits, and waited in a 
much smaller vestibule while Ele- 
phant used the more conventional 
intercom. 

Dianna seemed rather dubious 
about letting him in until he roared 
that he had a guest and she should 
stop fooling around. 

Dianna was a small, pretty woman 
with skin the deep, uniform red of a 
Martian sky and hair like flowing 
quicksilver. Her irises had the same 
polished silver luster. She hadn’t 
wanted to let us in because we were 
both wearing our own skins, but she 
never mentioned it again once we 
were inside. 

Elephant introduced me to Dianna 
and instantly told her he’d acted to 
contact the Outsiders. 

“What’s an Outsider?” she asked 
with sudden interest. 

Elephant gestured with both hands, 
looked confused, turned helplessly 
toward me. 

“They’re hard to describe,” I said. 
“Think of a cat-o’-nine-tails with a 
big thick handle.” 

“They live on cold worlds,” said 
Elephant. 

“Small, cold, airless worlds like 
Nereid. They pay rent to use Nereid 
as a base, don’t they, Elephant? And 


they travel over most of the galaxy 
in big unpressurized ships with fusion 
drives and no hyperdrives.” 

“They sell information. They can 
tell me about the world I want to 
find, the most unusual planet in 
known space.” 

“They spend most of their time 
tracking starseeds.” 

Dianna broke in. “Why?” 
Elephant looked at me. I looked at 
Elephant. 

“Say!” Elephant exclaimed. “Why 
don’t we get a fourth for bridge?” 
Dianna looked thoughtful. Then 
she focused her silver eyes on me, 
examined me from head to foot and 
nodded gently to herself. “Sharrol 
Janss. I’ll call her.” 

While she was phoning, Elephant 
told me, “That’s a good thought. 
Sharrol’s got a tendency toward hero 
worship. She’s a computer analyst 
at Donovan’s Brains, Inc. You’ll like 
her.” 

“Good,” I said, wondering if we 
were still talking about a bridge 
game. It struck me that I was build- 
ing up a debt to Elephant. “Elephant, 
when you contact the Outsiders, I’d 
like to come along.” 

“Oh? Why?” 

“You’ll need a pilot. And I’ve 
dealt with Outsiders before.” 

“Okay, it’s a deal.” 

The intercom rang from the vesti- 
bule. Dianna went to the door and 
came back with our fourth for bridge. 
“Sharrol, you know Elephant. This 
is Beowulf Shaeffer, from We Made 
It. Bay, this is — ” 

“You!” I said. 

“You!” she said. 

It was the pickpocket.

in 

M y vacation lasted just four days. 

1 hadn’t known how long it 
would last, though I did know how 
it would end. Consequently I threw 
myself into it body and soul. If 
there was a dull moment anywhere 
in those fours days, 1 slept through 
it, and at that I didn’t get enough 
sleep. Elephant seemed to feel the 
same way. He was living life to the 
hilt; he must have suspected, as I 
did, that the Outsiders would not 
consider danger as a factor in choos- 
ing his planet. By their own ethics 
they were bound not to. The days of 
Elephant’s life might be running 
short. 

Buried in those four days were in- 
cidents that made me wonder why 
Elephant was looking for a weird 
world. Surely Earth was the weirdest 
of all ... 

I remember when we threw in the 
bridge hands and decided to go out 
for dinner. This was more compli- 
cated than it sounds. Elephant hadn’t 
had a chance to change to flatlander 
styles, and neither of us was fit to be 
seen in public. Dianna had cosmetics 
for us. 

I succumbed to an odd impulse. I 
dressed as an albino. 

They were body paints, not pills. 
When I finished applying them, there 
in the full length mirror was my 
younger self. Blood-red irises, snow- 
white hair, pale transparent skin with 
a tinge of pink showing beneath: 
the teenager who bad disappeared 
ages ago, when I was old enough to 


use tannin pills. My mind wandered 
far back across the decades, to the 
days when I was a flatlander my- 
self, my feet firmly beneath the 
ground, my head never higher than 
seven feet above the desert sands 
.... They found me there before 
the mirror and decided my public 
was ready for me. 

I remember that evening, when 
Dianna told me she had known 
Elephant forever. “I was the one who 
named him Elephant,” she bragged. 
“It’s a nickname?” 

“Sure,” said Sharrol. “His real 
name is Gregory Pelton.” 

“O-o-oh.” Suddenly all came clear. 
Gregory Pelton is known among the 
stars. It is rumored that he owns the 
thirty-light-year-wide rough sphere 
called human space, that he earns 
his income by renting it out. It is 
rumored that General Products, os- 
tensibly run by the puppeteer species 
and now defunct in the absence of 
same, is a front for Gregory Pel- 
ton. It’s a true fact that his great-to- 
the-eighth grandmother invented the 
transfer booth, and that he is rich, 
rich, rich! 

I asked, “Why Elephant? Why 
that particular nickname?” 

Dianna and Sharrol looked de- 
murely at the tablecloth. Elephant 
said, “Use your imagination, Bay.” 
“On what? What’s an elephant, 
some kind of animal?” 

Three faces registered annoyance. 
I’d missed a joke. 

“Tomorrow,” said Elephant, “we’ll 
show you the Zoo.” 

There are seven transfer booths in 


FLATLANDER 


87 



die Zoo of Earth. That’ll tell you 
how big it is. But you’re wrong; 
you’ve forgotten the two hundred 
taxis on permanent duty. They’re 
there because the booths are too far 
apart for walking. 

We stared down at dusty, compact 
animals smaller than starseeds * or 
bandersnatchi, but bigger than any- 
thing else I’d ever seen. Elephant 
said, “See?” 

“Yah,” I said, because the animals 
showed a compactness and a plod- 
ding invulnerability very like Ele- 
phant’s. And then I found myself 
watching one of the animals in a 
muddy pool. It was using a hollow 
tentacle over its mouth to spray 
water on its back. 1 stared at that ten- 
tacle . and stared .... 

“Hey, look!” Sharrol called, 
pointing. Bay’s ears are turning 
red!” 

I didn’t forgive her ’til two that 
morning. 

And I remember reaching over 
Sharrol to get a tabac stick and see- 
ing her purse lying on her other 
things. I said, “How if I picked your 
pocket now?” 

Orange and silver lips parted in a 
lazy smile. “I’m not wearing a pock- 
et.” 

“Would it be in good taste to sneak 
the money out of your purse?” 

“Only if you could hide it on you.” 

I found a small, flat purse with 
four hundred stars in it and stuck 
it in my mouth. 

She made me go through with it. 
Ever made love to a woman with a 
purse in your mouth? Unforgettable. 
Don't try it if you’ve got asthma. 

I remember Sharrol. I remember 


smooth, warm blue skin, silver eyes 
half-closed in cool blue loveliness, 
orangeHand-silver hair in a swirling 
abstract pattern that nothing could 
muss. It always sprang back. Her 
laugh was silver too, when I gently 
extracted two handfuls of hair and 
tied them in a hard double knot, and 
when I gibbered and jumped up and 
down at the sight of her hair slowly 
untying itself like Medusa’s locks. 
And her voice was a silver croon. 

remember the freeways. 

They were the first thing that 
showed, coming in on Earth. If we’d 
landed at night it would have been 
the lighted cities; but of course we 
came in on the day side. Why else 
would a world have three spaceports? 
There were the freeways and auto- 
stradas and autobahns, strung in an 
all-enclosing net across the faces of 
the continents. 

From a few miles up you still 
can’t see the breaks. But they’re 
there, when girders and pavement 
have collapsed. Only two super- 
highways are still kept in good repair. 
Both are on the same continent: the 
Pennsylanvia Turnpike and the 
Santa Monica Freeway. The rest of 
the network is broken chaos. 

It seems there are people who col- 
lect old groundcars and race them. 
Some are renovated machines with 
half the parts replaced; others are 
handmade reproductions. On a per- 
fectly flat surface they’ll do sixty to 
a hundred miles per hour. 

I laughed when Elephant told me 
about them. Seeing them in person 
was different. * 

The rodders began to appear about 



88 


IF 



dawn. They gathered around one end 
of the Santa Monica Freeway, the 
end that used to join the San Diego 
Freeway. This end is a maze of fallen 
spaghetti, great curving loops of 
prestressed concrete that have lost 
their strength over the years and 
sagged to the ground. But you can 
still use the top loop to reach the 
starting line. We watched from 
above, hovering in a cab as the 
groundcars moved into line. 

“Their dues cost more than the 
cars,” said Elephant. “I used t© 
drive one myself. .You’d turn white 
as snow if I told you how much it 
costs to keep this stretch of freeway 
in repair.” 

“How much?” 

He told me. I turned white as 
snow. 

They were off. I was still wonder- 
ing what kick they got, driving an 
obsolete machine on flat concrete 
when they could be up here with 
us. They were off, weaving slightly, 
weaving more than slightly, foolish- 
ly moving at different speeds, com- 
ing perilously close to each other be- 
fore sheering off — and I began to 
realize things. 

Those automobiles had no radar. 

They were being steered with a 
cabin wheel geared directly to four 
ground wheels. A mistake in steering 
and they’d crash into each other, or 
into the concrete curbs. They were 
steered and stopped by muscle 
power; but whether they could turn 
or stop depended on how hard four 
rubber balloons could grip smooth 
concrete. If the tires loosed their 
grip Newton’s First Law would take 
over; the fragile metal mass would 


continue moving in a straight tine 
until stopped by a concrete curb or 
another groundcar. 

“A man could get killed in me ©f 
those.” 

“Not to worry,” said Elephant. 
“Nobody does, usually.” 

“Usually?” 

He told me. I turned white as 
snow. 

The race ended twenty minutes 
later, at another tangle of fatten 
concrete. I was wet through. We 
landed and met some of the racers. 
One of them, a thin guy with tangled, 
glossy green hair and a bony white 
face with a widely grinning scarlet 
mouth, offered me a ride. I declined 
with thanks, backing slowly away 
and wishing for a weapon. This 
joker was obviously dangerously in- 
sane. 

I remember flatlander food, the 
best in known space, and an odd, 
mildly alcoholic drink called Taittin- 
ger Comtes de Champagne ’59. I re- 
member invading an outworlder bar, 
where the four of us talked shop 
with a girl rock miner whose inch- 
wide auburn crest of hair fell clear 
to the small of her back. I remem- 
ber flying cross-country with a lift 
belt, and seeing nothing but city en- 
closing widely separated patches of 
food-growing land. I remember a 
submerged hotel off the Grand 
Banks of Newfoundland, and a dol- 
phin embassy off Italy where a mixed 
group of dolphins and flatlanders 
seemed to be solving the general 
problem of sentient beings without 
hands (there are many, and we’ll 
probably find more) . It seemed more 


FLATLANDER

a cottee-break discussion than true 
business. 

We were about to break up for 
bed on the evening of the fourth 
day, when the tridphone rang. Don 
Cramer had found an Outsider. 

I said, disbelieving, “You’re leaving 
right now?" 

“Sure!” said Elephant. “Here, take 
one of these pills. You won’t feel 
sleepy ’til we’re on our way.” 

A deal is a deal, and I owed Ele- 
phant plenty. I took the pill. We 
kissed Sharrol and Dianna good-by, 
Dianna standing on a chair to reach 
me, Sharrol climbing me like a bean- 
pole and wrapping her legs around 
my waist. I was a foot and a half 
taller than either of them. 

Calcutta Base was in daylight. 
Elephant and I took the transfer 
booth there, to find that the ST& 
had been shipped ahead of us. 

Her full name Was Slower Than 
Infinity. She had been built into a 
General Products #2 hull, a three 
hundred foot spindle with a wasp 
waist constriction near the tail. I 
was relieved. The General Products 
hull is both invulnerable and imper- 
meable to matter and energy other 
than visible light, as guaranteed by 
the puppeteer company and proven 
over thousands of years of use; but 
none of the four designs are pretty, 
and they all look alike. I was afraid 
Elephant might own a flashy, vulner- 
able dude’s yacht. The two-man con- 
trol room looked pretty small for a 
lifesystem until I noticed the bubble 
extension folded into the nose. The 
rest of the hull held a one gee fusion 
drive and fuel tank, a hyperspace 
motor, a gravity drag and belly land- 


ing gear, ail cleariy visible through 
the hull, which had been left trans- 
parent. 

She held fuel, food and aid. She 
must have been ready for days. We 
left twenty mintes after arriving. 

Using the fusion drive in Earth’s 
atmosphere would have gotten us in- 
to the organ banks, in pieces. Flat- 
lander laws are strict about air pollu- 
tion. A robot rocket with huge wings 
lifted us to orbit, using air compress- 
ed nearly to degenerate matter as a 
propellant. We took off from there. 

Now there was plenty of time for 
sleep. It took us a week at one gee 
just to get far enough out of the 
solar system’s gravity well to use the 
hyperdrive. Somewhere in that time 
I removed my false coloring (it had 
been false; I’d continued to take tan- 
nin secretion pills against Earth’s 
sunlight), and Elephant turned his 
skin back to light tan and his beard 
and hair back to black. For four 
days he’d been Zeus, with marble 
skin and a metal-gold beard and 
glowing molten gold eyes. It had 
fitted him so perfectly that I hardly 
noticed the change. 

Hyperdrive — and a long, slow 
three weeks. We took turns hover- 
ing over the mass indicator, though 
at first quantum hyperdrive speeds 
we’d have seen a mass at least twelve 
hours before it became dangerous. 

I think I was the only man who knew 
there was a second quantum — a 
puppeteer secret. The Outsider ship 
was near the edge of known space, 
well beyond Tau Ceti. 

“It was the only one around,” 
Elephant had said. “Number four- 
teen.” 


90 


IF 



“Fourteen? That’s the same ship I 
dealt with before.” 

“Oh? Good. That should help.” 
Days later he asked, “How’d it 
happen?” 

“The usual way. Number fourteen 
was on the other side of known space 
then, and she sent out an offer of 
information exchange. I was almost 
to Wunderland, and I caught the 
offer. When I dropped my passen- 
gers I went back.” 

“Did they have anything worth- 
while?” 

“Yah. They’d found the Lazy 
Eight //.” 

T he Lazy Eight II had been one 
of the old slowboats, a circular 
flying wing taking colonists to Jinx. 
Something had gone wrong before 
turnover, and the ship had continued 
on, carrying fifty passengers in sus- 
pended animation and a crew of 
four, presumed dead. With a ram- 
scoop to feed hydrogen to her fusion 
drive she could accelerate forever. 
She was five hundred years on her 
way. 

“I remember,” said Elephant. 
“They couldn’t reach her.” 

“No. But we’ll know where to 
find her when the state of the art 
gets that good.” 

“That won’t be soon.” 

He was right. A hyperdrive ship 
would not only have to reach her, 
but to carry reaction fuel to match 
her speed. Her speed was just less 
than a photon’s, and she was more 
than five hundred light-years away, 
seventeen times the diameter of 
known space. 

“They’ll wait for us,” I said. 


“Did you have any problems?” 
“Their translator is pretty good. 
But we’ll have to be careful. The 
thing about buying information is 
that you don’t know what you’ve got 
until you’ve bought it. They couldn’t 
just offer to sell me the present posi- 
tion of the Lazy Eight II. We’d have 
tracked their course by scope until 
we saw fusion light, and gotten the 
information free.” 

The time came when only a small 
green dot glowed in the center of the 
mass indicator. A star would have 
shown as a line; no star would have 
shown as no dot. I dropped out of 
hyperspace and set the deep-radar to 
hunt out the Outsider. 

IV 

he Outsider found us first. 
Somewhere in the cylindrical 
metal pod near her center of mass, 
perhaps occupying it completely, was 
the reactionless drive. It was com- 
mon knowledge that that drive was 
for sale, and that the cost was a full 
trillion stars. Though nobody, and 
no nation now extant, could afford 
to pay it, the price was not exorbi- 
tant. In two or three minutes, while 
we were still searching, that drive 
had dropped the Outsider ship from 
above point nine lights to zero rela- 
tive and pulled it alongside the ST oo 
One moment, nothing but stars. 
The next, the Outsider ship was 
alongside. 

She was mostly empty space. I 
knew her population was the size of 
a small city, but she was much bigger 
because more strung out. There was 
the minuscule-seeming drive capsule, 



FLATLANDER 


91 



and there, on a pole two and a half 
miles long, wias a light source. The 
rest of the ship was metal ribbons, 
winding in and out, swooping giddily 
around themselves and each other, 
until the ends of each tangled ribbon 
stopped meandering and joined to the 
drive capsule. There were around a 
thousand such ribbons, and each was 
the width of a wide city pedwalk. 

“Like a Christmas tree decora- 
tion,” said Elephant. “What now, 
Bay?” 

“They’ll use the ship radio.” 

A few minutes of waiting, and 
here came a bunch of Outsiders. 
They looked like black cat-o’-nine- 
tails with grossly swollen handles. In 
the handles were their brains and 
invisible sense organs; in the whip 
ends, the clusters of mobile root-ten- 
tacles, were gas pistols. Six of them 
braked to a stop outside the airlock. 

The radio spoke. “Welcome to 
Ship Fourteen. Please step outside 
for conveyance to our office. Take 
nothing on the outsides of your pres- 
suffe suits.” 

Elephant asked, “Do we?” 

I said, “Sure. The Outsiders are 
nothing if not honorable.” 

We went out. The six Outsiders 
offered us a tentacle each, and away 
we went across open space. Not fast. 
The thrust from the gas pistols was 
very low, irritatingly weak. But the 
Outsiders themselves were weak: an 
hour in the gravity of Earth’s moon 
would have killed them, 

They maneuvered us through a 
tangled clutter of silver ribbons, 
landed us on a ramp next to the 
looming convex wall of the drive 
capsule. 


It wasn’t quite like being lost in a 

lies. The rigid 




giant bowl of 
ribbons were too far apart for that 
Far above us was the light source, 
about as small and intense amd yel- 
lowish-white as Earth’s sun seen 
from a moon of Neptune. Shining 
down through the interstellar vacu- 
um, it cast a network of sharp black 
shadows across all the thousand 
looping strands that made up the 
city. 

Along every light-shadow border- 
line were the Outsiders. Just as their 
plantlike ancestors had done billions 
of years ago on some unknown 
world near the galactic core, the 
Outsiders were absorbing life-energy. 
Their branched tails lay in shadow, 
their heads in sunlight, while thermo- 
electricity charged their biochemical 
batteries. Some had root-tentacles 
dipped in shallow food dishes; the 
trace elements which kept them alive 
and growing were in suspension in 
liquid helium. 


W e stepped carefully around 
them, using our headlamps at 
lowest intensity, following one of the 
Outsiders toward a door in the wall 
ahead. There were no rails along the 
ramps, and nothing but the cold dis- 
tant stars beneath. Outsiders moved 
aside if we came to close. Our suits 
may have been leaking too much 
heat. 

The enclosure was dark until the 
door closed behind us. Then the 
light came on. It was sourceless, the 
color of normal sunlight, and it 
illuminated a cubicle that was hare 
and square. The only furnishing was 
a hemisphere of very dark glass with 


92 


IF 



the coiled shape of an Outsider in- 
side. The hemisphere must have been 
both evacuated and refrigerated. 
Only excellent manners could have 
put him here at all, as if he were 
the guest instead of us. 

. “Welcome,” said the room. What- 
ever the Outsider had said was not 
sonic in nature. “This air is breath- 
able. Take off your helmets, suits, 
shoes, girdles and whatnot.” It was 
an excellent translator, with a good 
grasp of idiom and a pleasant bari- 
tone voice. 

“Thanks,” I said, and we doffed 
our suits, Elephant a little self-con- 
sciously. 

“Which of you in Gregory Pel- 
ton?” 

“I am.” - 

“Hi. According to your agent, 
you want to know how to reach 
that planet which is most unusual in- 
side the borders of the sixty-light- 
year-wide region you call known 
space. Is this correct?” 

“Yes.” 

“We must know if you plan to go 
there or to send agents there. Also, 
do you plan a landing, a near orbit, 
or a distant orbit?” 

“Landing.” 

“Are we to guard against danger 
to your life or property?” 

“No.” Elephant’s voice was dry. 
The Outsider ship was an intimidat- 
ing place. 

“What kind of craft would you 
use?” 

“The ship we came in.” 

“Do you plan colonization? Min- 
ing? Growth of food plants or ani- 
mals?” 

“I plan only one visit.” 


“We have selected a world for 
you. The price will be one million 
stars.” 

“That’s high,” said Elephant. I 
whistled under by breath. It was: and 
it wouldn’t get lower. The Outsiders 
never dickered. 

“Sold,” said Elephant. 

The translator gave us a triplet 
set of coordinates some twenty-four 
light-years from Earth along galac- 
tic north. “The star you are looking 
for is a protosun with one planet a 
billion and a half miles distant. The 
system is moving at point eight lights 
toward — he gave a vector direction. 
It seemed the protosun was drawing 
a shallow chord through known 
space; it would never approach hu- 
man space. 

“No good,” said Elephant. “No 
hyperdrive ship can go that fast in 
real space.” 

“You could hitch a ride,” said 
the translator. “With us. Moor your 
ship to our drive capsule.” 

“That’ll work,” said Elephant. He 
was getting more and more uneasy; 
his eyes seemed to be searching die 
walls for the source of the voice. He 
would not look at the Outsider busi- 
ness agent in the vacuum chamber. 

“Our ferry fee will be one mil- 
lion stars.” 

Elephant sputtered. 

“Just a sec,” I said. “I may have 
information to sell you.” 

T tfiere was a long pause. Elephant 
looked at me in surprise. 

“You are Beowulf Shaeffer?” 
“Yah. You remember me?” 

“We find you in our records. 
Beowulf Shaeffer, we have informa-

tion for you, already paid. The 
former regional president of General 
Products on Jinx wishes you to con- 
tact him. I have a transfer booth 
number.” 

“That’s late news,” I said. “The 
puppeteers are gone. Anyway, why 
would that two-headed sharpie want 
to see me?” 

“I do not have that information. 
I do know that not all puppeteers 
have left this region. Will you ac- 
cept the transfer booth number?” 

“Sure.” 

I wrote down the eight digits as 
they came. A moment later Elephant 
was yelling, just as if he were a 
tridee set turned on in the middle of 
a program. “ — hell is going on 
here?” 

“Sorry about that, ’’said the trans-

“What happened?” I asked. 

“I couldn’t hear anything! Did that 
monk — Did the Outsider have pri- 
vate business with you?” 

“Sort of. I’ll tell you later.” 

The translator said, “Beowulf 
Shaeffer, we do not buy information. 
We sell information and use the 
proceeds to buy territory and food 
soil.” 

“You may need this information,” 
I argued. “I’m the only man within 
reach who knows it.” 

“What of other races?” 

The puppeteers might have told 
them, but it was worth taking a 
chance.^ “You’re about to leave 
known space. If you don’t deal with 
me you may not get this information 
in time.” 

“What price do you set on this 
item?” 


“You set the price. You’ve got 
more experience at putting values 
on information, and you’re honor- 
able. 

“We may not be able to afford 
an honest price.” 

“The price may not exceed our 
ferry fee.” 

“Done. Speak.” 

I told him of the Core explosion 
and how I’d come to find out about 
it. He made me go into detail on 
what I’d seen: the bright patch of 
supernovae spreading out as my ship 
caught up with ancient light waves, 
until all the bright multicolored ball 
of the Core was ablaze with super- 
novae. “You couldn’t have known 
this until you got there, and then 
it would have been too late. You 
don’t use faster-than-light drives.” 
“We knew from the puppeteers 
that the Core had exploded. They 
were not able to go into detail be- 
cause they had not seen it for them- 
selves.” 

“Oh. Ah, well. I think the ex- 
plosion must have started at the back 
side of the Core from here. Other- 
wise it would have seemed' to go 
much more slowly.” 

“Many thanks. We will waive your 
ferry fee. Now, there is one more 
item. Gregory Pelton, for an ad- 
ditional two hundred thousand stars 
we will tell you exactly what is 
peculiar about the planet you in- 
tend to visit.” 

“Can I find out for myself?” 

“It is likely.” 

“Then I will.” 

Silence followed. The Outsider 
hadn’t expected that. I said, “I’m 
curious. Your galaxy is rapidly be- 


FLATLANDER 


95 



coming a death trap. What will you 
do now?” 

“That information will cost 
you — ” 

“Forget it.” 

O utside, Elephant said, “Thanks.” 
“Forget it I wonder what they 
will do?” 

“Maybe they can shield themselves 
against the radiation.” 

“Maybe. But they won’t have any 
starseeds to follow.” 

“Do they need them?” 

Finagle only knew. The starseeds 
followed a highly rigid migratory 
mating pattern out from the Core of 
the galaxy and into the arms, al- 
most to the rim, before turning back 
down to the Core. They were doom- 
ed. As they returned to the Core 
the expanding wave of radiation from 
the multiple novas would snuff out 
the species one by one. What would 
the Outsiders do without them? What 
the hell did they do with them? Why 
did they follow them? Did they need 
starseeds? Did starseeds need Out- 
siders? The Outsiders would answer 
these and related questions for one 
trillion stars apiece. Personal ques- 
tions cost high with the Outsiders. 

A crew was already ringing the 
ST oo in to dock. We watched from 
the ramp, with crewmen sunbathing 
about our feet. We weren’t worried. 
The way the Outsiders handled it, 
our invulnerable hull might have 
been made of spun sugar and sun- 
beams. When a spiderweb of thin 
strands fastened the ST co to the 
wall of the drive capsule, the voice 
of the translator spoke in our ears 
and invited us to step aboard. We 


jumped a few hundred feet upward 
through the trace of artificial gravi- 
ty, climbed into the airlock and got 
out of our suits. 

“Thanks again,” said Elephant. 

“Forget it again,” I said mag- 
nanimously. “I owe you plenty. 
You’ve been putting me up as a 
house guest on the most expensive 
world in known space, acting as my 
guide where the cost of labor is — ” 

“Okay okay okay. But you saved 
me a million stars, and don’t you 
forget it.” He whopped me on the 
shoulder and hurried into the con- 
trol room to set up a million-star 
credit base for the next Outsider ship 
that came by. 

“I won’t,” I called at his retreating 
back. And wondered what the hell I 
meant by that? 

Much later I wondered about 
something else. Had Elephant 
planned to take me to “his” world? 
Or did he think to go it alone, to be 
the first to see it and not one of 
the first two? After the Outsider 
episode it was already too late. He 
couldn’t throw me off the ship then. 

I wished I’d thought of it in time. 
I never wanted to be a batman. My 
stake in this was to gently, tactfully 
keep Elephant from killing himself 
if it became necessary. For all his 
vast self-confidence, vast riches, vast 
generosity and vast bulk, he was 
still only a flatlander, and thus a 
little bit helpless.

table; it was there for exercising 
and killing time, but it also supplied 
a fine view; the surface was per- 
fectly transparent. 

Otherwise we would have missed 
it. 

There was no pressure against the 
seat of the pants, no crawling sen- 
sation in the pit of the stomach, no 
feel of motion. But Elephant, who 
was talking about a Jinxian frail he’d 
picked up in a Chicago bar, stopped 
just as she was getting ready to tear 
the place apart because some suicidal 
idiot had insulted her. 

Somebody heavy was sitting down 
on the universe. 

He came down slowly, like a fat 
man cautiously letting his weight 
down on a beach ball. From inside 
the bubble it looked like all the stars 
and nebulae around us were squeez- 
ing themselves together. The Out- 
siders on the ribbons outside never 
moved; but Elephant said something 
profane, and I steeled myself to look 
up. 

The stars overhead were blue- 
white and blazing. Around us they 
were squashed together; below, they 
were turning red and winking out, 
one by one. It had taken us a week 
to get out of the solar system, but 
the Outsider ship could have done it 
in five hours. 

The radio spoke. “Sirs, our crew- 
men will remove your ship from ours, 
after whioh you will be on your own. 
It has been a pleasure to do business 
with you.” 

A swarm of Outsider crewmen 
hauled us through the maze of bask- 
ing ramps and left us. Presently the 
Outsider ship vanished, gone sud- 


denly off, now on its own business. 

In the strange starlight Biephant 
let out a long, shaky sigh* Some 
people can’t take aliens. They don't 
find puppeteers graceful and beauti- 
ful; they find them horrifying, 
wrong . They see kzinti as slavering 
carnivores whose only love is fighting 
and killing, which is the truth; but 
they don’t see the rigid code of hon- 
or, nor the self-control which al- 
lows a kzin ambassador to ride a 
human city pedwalk without slash- 
ing out with his claws at the im- 
pertinent stabbing knees and elbows. 
Elephant was one of these people. 

He said, “Okay,” in amazed re- 
lief that they were actually gone. 
“I’ll take the first watch, Bay.” 

He did not say, “Those bastards 
would take your heart as collateral 
on a tenth-star loan.” He couldn’t 
see them as that close to human. 


I f Elephant’s weakness was aliens, 
mine was relativity. 

The trip through hyperspace was 
routine. I’d been trained to take the 
sight of the two small windows turn- 
ing into blind spots, becoming areas 
of nothing which seemed to draw to- 
gether the objects around them. So 
had Elephant; he'd done some fly- 
ing though he preferred the comfort 
of a luxury liner. But the Fast Pro- 
tosun was a week away, and even 
the best pilot occasionally has to drop 
back among die stars, to get his bear- 
ings and to assure his subconscious 
that the universe is still there. 

And each time it was changed, 
squashed flat. The crowded blue 
stars were all ahead; the sparse dim 
red stars were all behind. Four hun-

died years ago men and women had 
lived for years with such a view of 
the universe. But it hadn't happened 
since the invention of hyperdrive. 
I’d never seen the universe look like 
this. It bothered me. 

“No, it doesn’t bug me,” said Ele- 
phant when I mentioned it. We were 
a day out from our destination. “To 
me, stars are stars. But I have been 
worried about something. Bay, you 
said the Outsiders are honorable.” 
“They are. They’ve got to be. 
They have to be so far above sus- 
picion that any species they deal with 
will remember their unimpeachable 
ethics a century later. You can see 
that, can’t you? Outsiders don’t show 
up more often than that.” 

“Um. Okay. Why did they try to 
screw that extra two hundred kilo- 
stars out of me?” 

“Uh — ” 

“See, the goddam problem is, what 
if it was a fair price? What if we 
need to know what’s funny about 
the Fast Protosun?” 

“You’re right. Knowing the Out- 
siders, it’s probably information we 
can use. All right, we’ll nose around 
a little before we land. We’d have 
done that anyway, but now we’ll do 
it better.” 

W hat was peculiar about the 
Fast Protosun? 

Around lunchtime on the seventh 
ship’s day, a short green line in the 
sphere of the mass indicator began 
to extend itself. It was wide and 
fuzzy, just what you’d expect of a 
protosun. I let it reach almost to 
the surface of the sphere before I 
dropped us into normal space. 


The squashed universe looked in 
the windows. But ahead of us was a 
circular darkening and blurring of 
the vivid blue-white stars; and in the 
center of the circle was a dull red 
glow. 

“Let’s go into the extension bub- 
ble,” said Elephant. 

“Let’s not.” 

“We’ll get a better view in there.” 
He turned the dial that would make 
the bubble transparent. Naturally we 
kept it opaque in hyperspace. 

“Repeat, let’s not. Think about it, 
Elephant. What sense does it make 
to use an impermeable hull, then 
spend most of our time outside it? 
Until we know what’s here we ought 
to retract the bubble.” 

He nodded his shaggy head and 
touched the board again. Chugging 
noises announced that air and water 
were being pulled out of the bubble. 
Elephant moved to a window. 

“Ever seen a protosun?” 

“No,” I said. “I don’t think there 
are any in human space.” 

“That could be the peculiarity.” 

“It could. One thing it isn’t, is 
the speed of the thing. Outsiders 
spend all their time moving faster 
than this.” 

“But planets don’t. Neither dc 
stars. Bay, maybe this thing came 
from outside the galaxy. That would 
make it unusual.” 

It was time we made a list. I 
found a pad and solemnly noted 
speed of star, nature of star and 
possible extragalactic origin of star. 

“I’ve found our planet,” said Ele- 
phant. 

“Whereabouts?” 

“Almost on the other side of the

IF 



protosun. We can get there faster in 
hyperspace.” 

T Mie planet was still invisibly small 
where Elephant brought us out. 
The protosun looked about the same. 

A protosun is the foetus of a star: 
a thin mass of gas and dust, brought 
together by slow eddies in interstellar 
magnetic fields or by the presence 
of a Trojan point in some loose clus- 
ter of stars; a mass which is collap- 
sing and contracting due to gravity. 
I’d found material on protosuns in 
the ship’s library, but it was all astro- 
nomical data: nobody had ever been 
near one for a close look. In theory 
the Fast Protosun must have been 
fairly well along in its evolution, not 
only because it must have formed 
before acquiring its peculiar velocity, 
but because it was already glowing. 

“There it is,” said Elephant. “Two 
days away at one gee.” 

“Good. We can do our instrument 
checks on the way. Strap down.” 
With the fusion motor pushing us 
smoothly along, Elephant went back 
to the scope, and I started checking 
the other instruments. One thing 
stood out like a beacon. 

“Elephant. Have you noticed in 
me a tendency to use profanity for 
emphasis?” 

“Not really. Why?” 

“It’s goddam radioactive out 
there.” 

“Could you be more specific, sir?” 
“Our suit shields would break 
down in three days. The extension 
bubble would go in twenty hours.” 
“Okay, add it to your list. Any 
idea what’s causing it?” 

“Not one.” I made a note on my 


list. We were in no danger; the GP 
hull would protect us from anything 
but a heavy impact. 

“No asteroid belts,” said Elephant. 
“Meteor density zero, as far as 1 
can tell. No other planets.” 

“The interstellar gas may clean 
away anything small, at these 
speeds.” 

“One thing’s for sure, Bay. I got 
my money’s worth. This is a strange 
odd peculiar funny system.” 

“Yah. Well, we missed lunch. Let’s 
get dinner.” 

“Philistine.” 

VI 

E lephant ate fast. He was back at 
the scope before I was ready 
for coffee. Watching him move, I 
was again reminded of a juggernaut; 
but he’d never shown such determi- 
nation when I knew him on Earth. 
If a hungry kzin had been between 
him and the telescope, Elephant 
would have left footprints in fur. 

But the only thing that could get 
in his way out here was me. 

“Can’t get a close look at the 
planet,” said Elephant, “but it looks 
polished.” 

“Like a billiard ball?” 

“Just that. I don’t see any sign of 
an atmosphere.” 

“How about blast craters?” 
“Nothing.” 

“They should be there.” 

“This system’s pretty clean of 
meteors.” 

“The space around us shouldn’t be. 
And at these speeds — ” 

“Uh-huh. That better go on your 
list.”

I wrote it down on my list. 

We slept in the disaster couches. 
In front of me were the yellow lights 
of the control panel; the stars glowed 
red through one side window, blue 
through the other. I stayed awake a 
long time, staring through the for- 
ward window into the red darkness 
ahead. The window was opaqued, but 
I saw the protosun clearly in my 
imagination, like a blood droplet 
speading in dark, still water. 

The radiation held steady all 
through the next day. I did some 
more thorough checking, using tem- 
perature readings and deep-radar on 
both sun and planet. Everywhere I 
looked was a new anomaly. 

“This star definitely shouldn’t be 
glowing yet. It’s to spread out; the 
gas should be too thin for fusion.” 
“Is it hot enough to glow?” 

“Sure. But it shouldn’t be.” 
“Maybe the theories on protosuns 
are wrong.” 

“Put it on your list.” 

And, an hour later: 

“Elephant — ” 

“ Another peculiarity?” 

“Yah.” 

From under shaggy brows. Ele- 
phant’s eyes plainly told me he was 
getting sick of peculiarities. 

“According to the deep-radar shad- 
ow, this planet doesn’t have any 
lithosphere. It’s worn right down to 
what ought to be the magma, but 
isn’t because it’s so cold out here.” 
“Write it down. How many en- 
tries have you got?” 

“Nine.” 

“Is any one of them worth paying 
two hundred kilostars to know about 
beforehand?” 


“The radiation, maybe, if we didn’t 
have a GP hull.” 

“But,” said Elephant, glaring out 
at the huge, dark disk, “they knew 
we had a GP hull. Bay, can any- 
thing get through a General Products 
hull?” 

“Light, like a laser beam. Gravity, 
like tides crushing you into the nose 
of a ship when you get too close 
to a neutron star. Impact won’t harm 
the hull, but it’ll kill what’s inside.” 
“Maybe the planet’s inhabited. The 
more I think about it, the more sure 
I am it came from outside. Nothing 
in the galaxy could have given it 
this velocity. It’s diving through the 
plane of the galaxy; it wouldn’t 
have to push in from the rim.” 
“Okay. What do we do if some- 
one shoots a laser at us?” 

“We perish, I think. I had reflec- 
tive paint spread around the cabin, 
except for the windows, but the rest 
of the hull is transparent.” 

“We can still get into hyperspace 
from here. And for the next twenty 
hours. Afterwards we’ll be too close 
to the planet.” 

I went right to sleep that night, 
being pretty tired despite the lack of 
exercise. Hours later I slowly realized 
that I was being examined. I could 
see it through my closed eyelids; I 
could feel the heat of the vast red 
glare, the size of the angry eye, the 
awful power of the mind behind it. 
I tried to struggle away, smacked 
my hand on something and woke 
with a shock. 

I lay there in the red darkness. 
The edge of the protosun peeked 
through a window. I could feel its 
hostile glare.

I said, “Elephant.” 

“Mngl?” 

“Nothing. Morning would be 
soon enough. 

orning. 

“Elephant, would you do me 
a favor?” 

“Sure. You want Dianna? My 
right arm? Shave off my beard?” 
“I’ll keep Sharrol, thanks. Put on 
your suit, will you?” 

“Sure, that makes sense. We 
aren’t nearly uncomfortable enough, 
just because we closed off the bub- 
ble.” 

“Right. And because I’m a dedi- 
cated masochist, I’m going to put my 
suit on this instant. Now, I hate to 
enjoy myself alone — ” 

“You got the wind up?” 

“A little. Just enough.” 
“Anything for a friend. You go 
first.” 

There was just room to get our 
suits on one at a time. If the inner 
airlock door hadn’t been open there 
wouldn’t have been that. We tried 
leaving our helmets thrown back, 
but they got in our way against the 
crash couches. So we taped them to 
the window in front of us. 

I felt better that way, but Ele- 
phant clearly thought I’d flipped. 
“You sure you wouldn’t rather eat 
with your helmet on?” 

“I hate suit-food syrup. We can 
reach our helmets if we get a punc- 
ture.” 

“ What puncture? We’re in a Gen- 
eral Products hull!” 

“I keep remembering that the Out- 
siders knew that.” 

“We’ve been through that.” 


“Let’s go through it again. As- 
sume they thought we might be kill- 
ed anyway if we weren’t prepared. 
Then what?” 

“Gronk.” 

“Either they expected us to go out 
in suits and get killed, or they know 
of something that can reach through 
a General Products hull.” 

“Or both. In which case the suits 
do us no good at all. Bay, do you 
know how long it’s been since a Gen- 
eral Products hull failed?” 

“I’ve never heard of its happen- 
ing at all.” 

It never has.” 

“You’re dead right. I’ve been 
stupid. Go ahead and take off your 
suit.” 

Elephant turned to look at me. 
“And you?” 

“I’ll keep mine on.” 

Elephant shrugged his shaggy eye- 
brows and went back to the tele- 
scope. By then we were six hours 
from touchdown, and decelerating. 

“I think I’ve found an asteroid 
crater,” Elephant said presently. 

I had a look. “Yah, I think you’re 
right. But it’s damn near disappear- 
ed.” 

He took the telescope back. “It’s 
round enough. Almost has to be a 
crater. Bay, why should it be so 
eroded?” 

“It must be the interstellar dust. 
If it is, then that’s why there’s no 
atmosphere or lithosphere. But I 
can’t see the dust being that thick, 
even at these speeds.” 

“Put it — ” 

“Yah.” I reached for my list. 

“If we find one more anomaly I’ll 
throw a tantrum.” 



FLATLANDER

H alf an hour later we found life. 

By then we were close enough 
to use the gravity drag. The beautiful 
thing about a gravity drag is that it 
uses very little power. It converts a 
ship’s momentum relative to the near- 
est powerful mass into heat, and all 
you have to do is get rid of the heat. 
Since the ST 00 ’s hull would pass only 
various ranges of radiation corres- 
ponding to what the puppeteers’ 
varied customers call visible light, the 
ship builders had run a big radiator 
fin out from the gravity drag and 
through the hull. It glowed dull red 
behind us. And the fusion drive was 
off. There was no white fusion flame 
to hurt visibility. 

Elephant had the scope at highest 
magnification. At first, as I peered 
into the eyepiece, I couldn’t see what 
he was talking about. There was a 
dull white plain, all the same color 
except for a few bluish blobs. The 
blobs wouldn’t have stood out but 
for the uniform surface around them. 

Then one of them moved. Very 
slowly, but it was moving. 

“Right,” I said. “Let’s run a tem- 
perature check.” 

The surface temperature in that 
region was right for helium II. And 
on the rest of the planet as well; 
the protosun wasn’t putting out much 
heat, though it was on radiation. 

“I don’t think they match any 
species I know.” 

“I can’t tell,” said Elephant. He 
had the telescope and the library 
screen going at the same time, with 
a Sirius VIII Blob on the screen. 
“I’ve found twenty different species 
of helium life in this book, and they 
all look alike.” 


“Not quite. These must have 
a vacuum-proof integument. And 
you’ll notice those granules in the — ” 

“I treasure my ignorance on this 
subject, Bay. Anyway, we won’t 
find any known species on this world. 
At these speeds even a stage tree 
seed wouldn’t live through the im- 
, pact.” 

I let the subject die. 

Once again Elephant run the 
scope over “his” planet, this time 
looking for the blobby life forms. 
They were big for Helium II life, 
but not freakishly so. Many cold 
worlds develope life using the pe- 
culiar properties of superfluid heli- 
um; but, since such life hasn’t much 
use for complexity, it usually stays 
in the amoeba stage. 

There was one peculiarity, which 
I dully noted. Every animal was on 
the planet’s backside with relation 
to its course through the galaxy. 
They weren’t afraid of protosunlight, 
but they seemed to fear interstellar 
dust. 

T ^wo hours passed. 

The red glow of the radiator fin 
became more pronounced. The 
planet was closer, but no more de- 
tailed. 

“Cue Ball,” said Elephant. 

“No good. It’s been used. For 
Beta Lyrae I.” 

“Too bad. How about Swoosh?” 
“Huh? Oh, Swoosh. That isn’t 
bad.” 

“That’s it then. Swoosh, discover- 
ed by Gregory Zhiv Pelton and 
Friend.” 

“Elephant, what are we doing 
here?” 


102 


IF 



He turned, startled. “What do you 
mean?” 

“Look, you know by now I’m with 
you all the way. But I do wonder. 
You spent a million stars getting 
here, and you’d have spent two if you 
had to. You could be home in the 
Rockies with Dianna, or hovering 
near Beta Lyrae, which is unusual 
enough and much better scenery 
than, uh, Swoosh. You could be 
sampling oddball drugs and biochemi- 
cals in Crashlanding, or looking for 
mist demons on Plateau, or hunting 
bandersnatchi and vice versa on a 
Jinx shoreline. Why here?” 

“Because it is there?” 

“What the blazes kind of an an- 
swer is that?” 

“Bay, once upon a time there was 
a guy named Miller. Six years ago 
he took a ramscoop-fusion drive ship 
out of a museum and put a hyper- 
drive in it and set out for the edge 
of the universe. He figured he could 
get his hydrogen in normal space 
and use the fusion plant to power 
his hyperdrive. He’s probably still 
going. He may go forever, unless he 
hits something. So why?” 

“A psychiatrist I’m not.” 

“He wanted to be remembered. 
When you’re dead a hundred years, 
Bay, what will you be remembered 
for?” 

“I’ll be the idiot who rode with 
Gregory Pel ton, who spent two 
months of his life and more than a 
million stars to set his ship down 
once on a totally useless planet.” 
“Gronk. But do you see? You’ll be 
remembered.” 

“There must be better things to 
be remembered for.” 


“I can’t write novels. I’d make a 
lousy planetary president. A scientist 
I’m not. What’s left?” 

“Found a dynasty?” 

Elephant’s lips tightened, and he 
glared — not at me, but ahead. 
“Arrgh,” he growled. “I’d make a 
lousy emperor too. Let’s drop it, 
shall we?” 

“Okay,” I said. Because some- 
thing had occurred to me. 

That guy named Miller — I’d 
heard of him. He’d been sterilized 
while standing too close to a fusion- 
electric plant the day it decided to 
leak just a little. There were other 
heroes, whose names were remem- 
bered because they had done strange, 
difficult, not particularly useful 
things. Mae Doolin, who had climb- 
ed forty miles down the side of 
Mount Lookitthat in a suit she had 
designed herself. If she’d spent a 
couple of extra months on that pres- 
sure suit she’d have made it back 
up. Lynaeus (true name unknown), 
who fought kzinti with his bare 
hands, and lived to teach the Hell- 
flare Boys how. Had any of them 
had families? 

Did Elephant have children? Could 
he? 

I could ask the first question, if I 
phrased it right. I’d have to be sub- 
tle. 

“Elephant, are you ster — ” 

There was a muffled, authoritative 
boom , instantly followed by a stran- 
gling pressure in my larynx and a 
cool, puffy sensation over my skin 
surface and a stabbing pain in the 
ears. 

I heard the bare beginning of an 
alarm as the air went. Already I

was reaching for my helmet. I 
clamped it down hard, spun the col- 
lar, and gave vent to an enormous 
belch at the same time as the wind 
went shrieking from my lungs. 

VII 

T 'here was no way to realize what 
was happening, and no time. 
Vacuum was around us; and air was 
spraying into my suit, frigid with 
storage. Iron spikes were being 
driven through my ears and sinuses; 
but I was going to live. My lungs 
held ,a ghastly emptiness, but my suit 
was inflating. I would live. 

You don’t know how selfish your 
thoughts can be until you’ve come 
that close to the Blowout Death. My 
hands started to shake; I clamped 
down on myself and turned to Ele- 
phant. 

The fear of death was naked in 
his face. He had his helmet down, 
but he was having trouble with the 
collar. Mist wreathed his neck ring. 
I had to force his hands away to 
fasten his helmet down. The glass 
misted over, then cleared; he was 
getting air. Had it come in time? 

/ was alive. The pain was leaving 
my ears and sinuses, and I was 
breathing: inhale, pause, inhale, as 
the presure rose to normal. 

Now I had time to think it 
through, to remember what I’d seen 
without noticing, to play it back. 
What had happened was insane. 
The hull had turned to dust. Just 
that. All at once and nothing first, 
the ship’s exterior had disintegrated 
and blown away on a puff of breath- 
ing-air. I’d seen it. 


And sure enough, the hull was 
gone. Only the innards of the ship 
remained. Before me, the lighted 
control board. A little below that, 
the manhole to the packed bubble, 
and the bubble package itself. Above 
the board, the dull half-disk of 
Swoosh, and stars. To the left, stars. 
To the right, Elephant, looking dazed 
and scared and alive. Beyond him, 
stars. Behind us, the airlock, the 
kitchen storage block and dial board, 
a glimpse of the landing legs and 
glowing radiator fin, and stars. The 
ST oo was a skeleton. 

Elephant shook his head, then 
tufned on his suit radio. I heard the 
magnified click in my helmet. 

We looked at each other, waiting. 
There seemed to be nothing to say, 
no comment that would fit without 
being obvious. 

I sighed, turned to the control 
board and brought the fusion drive 
to life. From what I could see of the 
ship, nothing was missing but the 
hull. Nothing vital was floating 
away. Whatever had been attached 
to the hull had also been attached 
to other things 

“What are you doing, Bay?” 
“Getting us out of here. You can 
throw your tantrum now.” 

“Why? I mean, why leave?” 

He’d flipped. Flatlanders are 
basically unstable. I got the drive 
pushing us at low power, turned off 
the gravity drag and swiveled to face 
him. “Look, Elephant. No hull.” I 
swept an arm in a circle. “None. 
Nothing.” 

“But what’s lfeft of the ship is still 
mine?” 

“Huh? Sure.”

“I want to land. Can you talk me 
out of it?” Behind that intimidating 
beard he was dead serious and, I was 
beginning to believe, quite mad. 
“The landing legs are intact. Our 
suits can stop the radiation for three 
days. We could land and take off in 
twelve hours.” 

“We probably could, if nothing 
else happened.” 

“And we’ve spent a month and a 
half getting here.” 

“Right. Silly, but right.” 

“I’d feel like an idiot, getting this 
close and then turning for home. 
Wouldn’t you?” 

“I feel like an idiot for getting 
this close, period. No, cancel that. 
Yes, I’d feel stupid going home with 
nothing to show. But we do have 
something to show.” 

“A skinned ship. All right, so the 
hull turned to dust and blew away. 
What does that mean? It means we’ve 
got a faulty hull, and I’m going to 
sue the hind legs off General Pro- 
ducts when we get back. But do you 
know what caused it?” 

“No. Do you?” 

He ignored the question. “So why 
assume it’s some kind of threat?” 

He was wrong. I knew it. But how 
to tell him so? 

64npe 11 you what I’ll do,” I said. 

A I turned the ship until it was 
tail down to Swoosh. “Now. We’ll 
be there in three hours if you insist 
on landing. This skinned corpse is 
your ship, just as you say. But I’m 
going to talk you out of it.” 

“That’s fair.” But his square, 
bearded mouth had less give in it 
than a snapping turtle’s. 


“Have you had astronaut train- 
ing?” 

“Naturally.” 

“Did it include a history course?” 

“All they taught me was how to 
fly a ship. And a little of the de- 
velopment of the state of the art.” 

“That’s something. You remember 
that they first explored the System 
with chemical fuels, and that the 
first ship to touch an asteroid was 
built in orbit around the Earth’s 
moon.” 

“I’ll take your word.” 

“This you may not know. There 
was a ship before that one, supposed 
to do the same job. It was launched 
on a course that took it just inside 
the moon’s orbit, then out and away. 
About thirty hours after launching, 
the crew noticed that all their ports 
were turning to frosted glass. Two 
of the men wanted to go on and 
finish the mission. The third man 
happened to be captain. So they 
used their rockets and stopped the 
ship dead. 

“Remember, the best materials 
they had were alloys of iron. The 
hull was carbon-alloyed iron; the 
ports were thick glass, two layers. 
Our heroes stopped the ship 238,000 
miles from the moon and called base 
to say they’d aborted the mission.” 

“You remember this pretty well. 
How come?” 

“Doc Spinoza drilled these stories 
into us again and again. Everything 
he taught us he illustrated with 
something from history. It struck. 
They do a thorough job on passen- 
ger-craft astronauts.” 

“Go on.” 

“They called base and told them 


FLATLANDER

about the windows. Somebody de- 
cided it must be dust, lots of dust. 
Someone else realized that they’d 
launched the ship straight through 
the moon’s lead Trojan point.” 
Elephant laughed, then coughed. 
“Stupid trick. Wish I hadn’t breathed 
so much vacuum. Sir, you’re leading 
up to something.” 

“If they hadn’t stopped the ship 
the dust would have tom it apart. 
Trojan points are dust collectors. 
And the moral of this story is, any- 
thing you don’t understand is dan- 
gerous until you do.” 

“Sounds paranoid.” 

“Maybe it does, to a flatlander. 
You come from a planet so kind to 
you, so seemingly adapted to you, 
that you think the whole universe 
is one big lavish government hous- 
ing project. You should listen to the 


Finaglists. The Perversity of the Uni- 
verse Tends Toward a Maximum. A 
certain neutron star would have 
killed me if I hadn’t understood that 
tidal effect in time.” 

“So it would. So you think all 
flatlanders are fools?” 

Dammit, I’d touched his exposed 
nerve. “No, Elephant. Just not para- 
noid enough. And I refuse to apolo- 
gize.” 

“Who asked you?” 

“I’ll land with you if you can tell 
me what made our hull turn to dust.” 
Elephant crossed his arms and 
glared forward. I shut up and waited. 

I’d have to land regardless, if he 
insisted. Not because there was only 
one ship. Not because I couldn’t just 
wait here for him. But because I’d 
invited myself along. 

Soon he said, “Can we get home?” 






“I don’t know. The hyperdrive will 
work, and we can use the gravity 
drag to slow us when we reach a 
system. We couldn’t have done that 
with the protosun: too much thick 
gas going through the system. Physi- 
cally we should be able to make it.” 
“Okay, let’s go. But I’ll tell you 
this, Bay. If I were alone I’d go 
down, and damn the hull.” 

S o we turned tail and ran, under 
protest from Elephant. In ten 
hours we were far enough from 
Swoosh’s gravity well to enter hyper- 
space. 

I turned on the hyperdrive, gasped 
and turned it off just as fast as I 
could. We sat there shaking. 

“We can inflate the bubble,” said 
Elephant. 

“But can we get in?” 


“I don’t know. It doesn’t have an 
airlock.” 

We worked it, though. There was 
a pressure control in the cabin, and 
we set it for zero. The electromag- 
netic field that folded it would now 
expand it without pressure. We went 
in, pressurized it and took off our 
helmets. 

“We’re beyond the radiation,” 
said Elephant. “I looked.” 

“Good.” You can go a long way 
in even a couple of seconds of hy- 
perdrive. “Now, there’s one thing 
I’ve got to know. Can you take that 
again?” 

Elephant shuddered. “Can you?” 

“I think so. I can do all the navi- 
gating if I have to.” 

“Anything you can take I can 
take.” 

“Can you take it and stay sane?” 



•‘Yes.” 

“Then we can trade off. But if 
you change your mind, let me know 
that instant. A lot of good men have 
left their marbles in the Blind Spot, 
and all they had to face were a cou- 
ple of covered windows.” 

“I believe you. Indedd I do, sir. 
How do we work it?” 

“We’ll have to chart a course 
through the least dense regions of 
known space. The nearest inhabited 
world is Kzin. I hate to have to trust 
the kzinti for help, but it looks like 
our best bet.” 

“Tell you what, Bay. Let’s at least 
aim for Jinx. I want to use that num- 
ber of yours to give the puppeteers 
hell.” 

“Fine.” If it turned out our minds 
couldn’t take it, we could always 
turn off. 

I spent an hour working out a 
course. When I finished there were 
precious few gravity wells along our 
path. We wouldn’t have to check the 
mass indicator more than once every 
twenty-four hours. 

Elephant won the finger- toss. I 
had won the first watch. 

We donned suits and depressurized 
the bubble. As I crawled through the 
manhole I saw Elephant making the 
bubble opaque. 

I squeezed into the crash couch, 
all alone among the compressed 
stars. The protosun had vanished be- 
hind us. 

More than half my range of vision 
was empty space. I found myself 
looking thoughtfully at the airlock. 
It was behind and to the left, a metal 
oblong standing alone at the edge of 
the deck, with both doors tightly 


closed. The inner door had slammed 
when the pressure dropped, and now 
the airlock mechanisms guarded the 
pressure inside against the vacuum 
at both doors. Nobody was inside to 
benefit; but how to explain that to a 
pressure sensor? 

I was procrastinating. The ship 
was aimed; I set my jaw and sent 
the ST oo into hyperspace. 

The Blind Spot, they call it. It 
fits. 

There is a way to find the blind 
spot in your eye. Close one eye, put 
two dots on a piece of paper and 
bring the paper toward you, focusing 
on one of the dots. If you hold the 
paper just right, the other dot will 
suddenly vanish. 

Let a ship enter hyperspace with 
the windows transparent, and the 
windows will seem to vanish. So will 
the space enclosing them. Objects 
on either side stretch and draw closer 
together to fill the missing space. If 
you look long enough, the Blind Spot 
starts to spread; the walls and the 
things against the walls draw even 
closer to the missing space, until 
they are engulfed. Covering the win- 
dows helps, but after awhile the 
Blind Spot starts to seep around the 
covers. 

It’s all in your mind, they tell me. 
So? 

I turned the key, and half my 
view was Blind Spot. The control 
board stretched and flowed. The 
mass indicator sphere tried to wrap 
itself around me. I reached for it, 
and my hands were distorted too. 
With considerable effort I put them 
back at my sides and got a grip on 
myself. 


108 


IF 



There was one fuzzy green line in 
the plastic distortion that had been a 
mass indicator. 

And it was behind and to the side. 
The ship could fly itself until Ele- 
phant’s turn came. I fumbled my 
way to the manhole and crawled 
through. 

VIII 

S ome time later, Elephant caught 
me looking at my list. He took 
it from me and began to study it. 

It said: 

1) Velocity of star — .8 lights. 

2) Nature of star — protosun. 

Unique in known space. 

3) Origin of star — extragalactic, 
in all probability. 

4) Unusual radiation. 

5) Planet has no atmosphere. 

6) No sign of blast craters on 
planet. 

7) Protosun shows strangely high 
temperature. 

8) Planet has no lithosphere. 

9) Blast crater, vastly eroded. 

Dust? Why so thick? 

10) He II beasts confined to back 
of planet. Fear dust? 

Elephant nodded to himself, added 
something and handed it back. The 
list now read: 

11) Hull disintegrated. 

Eleven notes. Eleven irregularities 
with no explanation. They must be 
connected. 

“If we knew more about our hull,” 
I said, “we could probably figure 
this out.” 

“Fat chance,” said Elephant. 
“That hull’s a puppeteer trade se- 
cret.” 


And there it died. 

All our conversations were dying 
young. Neither of us felt the urge 
to talk. The hours passed and became 
days. We took turns at the library 
screen; if the bubble hadn’t had an 
extension I don’t think we would 
have survived. Every twenty-four 
hours one of us went out to see if 
there were dangerous masses around, 
to drop back to normal space to take 
a fix and adjust our course. The few 
hours before each turn, we didn’t 
talk at all; because during these 
times, one of us would be tense 
enough to bite. 

On my third trip I had no more 
sense than to look up. 

I went more than blind. There was 
nothing at all in my field of 
vision, nothing but the Blind Spot. 

It was more than blindness. A 
blind man, a man whose eyes have 
lost their function, at least remem- 
bers what things looked like. A man 
who has suffered damage to the optic 
lobe of his brain doesn’t. I could re- 
member what I’d come out here for 
— to find out if there were masses 
near enough to harm us — but I 
couldn’t remember how to do it. I 
touohed a curved smooth surface and 
knew that this was the device that 
would tell me, if only I could guess 
its secret. 

Eventually my neck got sore, so 
I moved my head. That brought my 
eyes back into existence. 

When we got the bubble pressur- 
ized, Elephant said, “Where were 
you? You’ve been gone half an 
hour.” 

“And lucky at that. When you go 

109 


FLATLANDER 



out there, just don’t look up.” 
“Oh.” 

Why the blazes couldn’t we find 
something to talk about? Was it be- 
cause we’d end up talking about 
Swoosh? Maybe. The planet had de- 
feated us without ever noticing us. 
We’d named it, approached it and 
gone. Two mosquitoes which the 
mystery world hadn’t even had to 
swat. 

We’d left at my insistence. 

One day I braced him with it. 
“Elephant, there’s a word missing 
from our language.” 

He looked up from the reading 
screen. “More than one,” he said. 
“Things have been somewhat silent.” 
“One word. We’re so afraid of us- 
ing it that we’re afraid to talk at all.” 
“Name it.” 

“Coward.” 

Elephant wrinkled his brows, then 
snapped off the screen. “Okay, we’ll 
talk about it. First of all, you said 
it, I didn’t. Right?” 

“Right. Have you been thinking 
it?” 

“No. I’ve been thinking euphem- 
isms, like ‘overcautious’ and ‘reluc- 
tance to risk bodily harm.’ But since 
we’re on the subject, why were you 
so eager to turn back?” 

“I was scared.” I let the word 
soak through his brain. “The peo- 
ple who trained me made certain 
I’d be scared in certain situations. 
With all due respect. Elephant, I’ve 
had more training than you have. I 
think your wanting to land was the 
result of ignorance.” 

Elephant sighed. “You’re sure 
about that?” 

“Certainly not. I get less sure 


every day. Maybe I was bluffed out. 
Maybe we’d have landed in perfect 
safety, stepped out, found a good, 
reasonable answer to these eleven 
notes here, got back in, took off and 
arrived at Jinx twelve hours later 
than we will.” 

“Maybe. We won’t find out here, 
will we?” 

We wouldn’t. One of us was right, 
one wrong. If I was wrong, a pretty 
good friendship had just gone out 
the airlock. 

I hated that. I wasn’t even sure 
Sharrol wouldn’t side with Elephant. 
And if Sharrol decided I was a cow- 
ard — 

She’d only known me four days. 

Was I a coward? I’m no bom hero 
and never claimed to be. This was 
the first time in my life it had 
worried me. At times during that 
trip I actually thought about turning 
back; and then I’d catch a few men- 
utes of Blind Spot when my turn 
came around, and I’d go back to just 
hoping we’d reach Jinx. 

W e came out of hyperspace near 
the twin Sirius suns. But that 
wasn’t the end; we still faced a uni- 
verse moving at point eight lights. 
It took us almost two weeks to brake 
down to a normal velocity. The 
gravity drag’s radiator fin glowed 
orange-white most of the time. I 
can’t guess how many times we cir- 
cled back through hyperspace for 
another run through the system’s 
lumpy gravity well. 

But at last we were orbiting Jinx. 
I broke a silence of hours. “What 
now, Elephant? You’re going back, 
aren’t you?” 


110 


IF 



“As soon as we get in range, I’m 
going to call that number of yours.” 

“Then?” 

“Drop you off at Sirius Mater with 
enough money to get you home. I’d 
take it kindly if you’d use my house 
as your own until I come back from 
Swoosh. I’ll get a ship here.” 

“You don’t want me along?” 

“I’m going to land, Bay. Wouldn’t 
you feel like a damn fool if you died 
then?” 

“I’ve spent three months in an ex- 
tension bubble because of that silly 
planet. I’ve made an epic journey 
through hyperspace with no hull. If 
you conquer it alone I will feel like 
a damn fool.” 

Elephant looked excruciatingly un- 
happy. He started to speak, caught 
his breath — 

If ever I picked the right time to 
shut a man up, that was the time. 

“Hold it. Let’s call the puppeteers 
first. Plenty of time to decide.” 

Elephant nodded. In a moment 
he’d have told me he didn’t want me 
along because I was overly reluctant 
to risk bodily harm. Instead, he 
turned on the ship phone and dialed. 

J inx was a banded Easter egg be- 
low us. To the side was bloated 
orange Binary, the primary to which 
Jinx is a moon. We were close 
enough to talk to Jinx . and the 
puppeteers’ transfer booth number 
would also be their phone number. 
Elephant dialed. 

A sweet, thrilling contralto voice 
answered. There was no picture, but 
I could tell: no woman’s voice is 
quite that good. The puppeteer said, 
“89346770?” 


“My General Products hull just 
failed.” Elephant was getting right 
to the point. 

“I beg your pardon?” 

“My name is Gregory Pelton. 
Twelve years ago I bought a #2 hull 
from General Products. A month 
and a half ago, the hull failed. It 
turned to dust. We’ve spent the in- 
tervening time limping home. May I 
speak to a puppeteer?” 

The screen came on. Two brain- 
less triangular heads looked out at 
us with one eye each. “This is quite 
serious,” said the puppeteer, looking 
nothing but silly. With those floppy 
prehensile lips a puppeteer always 
looks silly. “Naturally we will pay 
the indemnity in full. Is that Beo- 
wulf Shaeffer?” 

“Yes,” I said, “but let’s take care 
of this first. Then I’ll find out what 
you wanted to see me about.” 

“By all means. Gregory Pelton, 
would you mind detailing the cir- 
cumstances under which your hull 
disintegrated?” 

Gregory Pelton didn’t mind at all. 
He was quite vehement about it. His 
ears and neck turned dark red; his 
thrusting beard seemed to acquire a 
life of its own. It was a pleasure to 
listen to him. The diffidence he’d 
shown the Outsiders was gone; he was 
treating the puppeteer like a clumsy 
engineer in his own factory. The 
alien’s silly expressions never waver- 
ed, but he was blinking rapidly when 
Elephant finished. 

“I see,” he said. “Our apologies 
are insufficient, of course, but you 
will understand that we made a na- 
tural mistake. We did not think that 
antimatter was available anywhere in 

Ilf 


FLATLANDER 



the galaxy, let alone in known space, 
and in such quantity.” 

Elephant’s bull voice went curious- 
ly soft. “Antimatter? Did you say 
antimatter?” 

It was as if he’d screamed the 
word. I heard it echoing from side 
to side across my skull. 

“Of course. We offer no excuse, 
but you should have realized it at 
once. Interstellar gas of normal mat- 
ter had polished the planet’s surface 
with minuscule explosions and torn 
away its lithosphere down to the 
magma, had raised the temperature 
of the protosun beyond rational ex- 
pectation, and was causing a truly re- 
markable radiation hazard. It had 
swept the protosun’s normal collec- 
tion of gas and dust completely away. 
Did you not even wonder about these 
things? You knew that the system 
was from beyond the galaxy. Hu- 
mans tare supposed to be curious, 
are they not?” 

“The hull,” said Elephant. 

“Yes. You are entitled to know. 
A General Products hull is an arti- 
ficially generated molecule whose in- 
teratomic bonds are artificially 
strengthened by a small power 
source. The strengthened bonds are 
proof against any kind of impact, 
and against heat into the millions of 
degrees. But when enough atoms had 
been removed from the molecule by 
antimatter collisions, the molecule 
naturally broke down.” 

Elephant nodded. I wondered if 
his voice was gone for good. 

“When may we expect you to col- 
lect your indeminity? I gather no hu- 
man was killed. This is fortunate. 
Our funds are low.” 


Elephant switched off the phone. 
He gulped once or twice, then turned 
to look me in the eye. I think it took 
all his strength; and if I’d waited for 
him to speak, I don’t know what he 
would have said. 

“I gloat,” I said. I hate sticky 
scenes. “Verily I gloat. I was right, 
you were wrong. If we’d landed on 
your forsaken planet we’d have gone 
up in pure light. At this time it gives 
me great pleasure to say, I Told You 
So.” 

He smiled weakly. “You told me 
so. Antimatter.” 

“Oh, I did, I did. Time after time 
I said, That Planet’s Haunted! It Will 
Steal Your Life And Soul, I said. 
There Have Been Signs in the 
Heavens to — ” 

“All right, you bastard, don’t 
overdo it. I owe you twice my life 
plus a million stars, and not a penny 
more.” 

“Okay, we’ll drop it. But there’s 
one thing I want you to remember.” 

“If I don’t understand it, it’s dan- 
gerous.” 

“That’s the one thing I want you 
to remember besides I Told You 
So.” 

H alf of Elephant’s house was 
buried in the face of Elephant’s 
cliff. The other half projected into 
space, without apparent support. A 
wide balcony ran round that ex- 
posed part, also without apparent 
support, and without a guard rail. 
The guardian force field at the edge 
was naturally invisible. 

Elephant was somewhere else, off 
on his own business. He had missed 
a pretty good dinner. 


112 


IF 



Sharrol poured us three after-din- 
ner drinks from a squat green bottle. 
It was labeled with typical flatlander 
verbosity: Rothschild Extra Fine 

Brandy Napoleon 2680. The fluid 
was clear, with a brown tinge. 

“One last question,” said Dianna. 
“What did the puppeteers want with 
you?” 

“They wanted me to explore the 
Clouds of Magellan for them. I 
turned them down.” 

The girls stared at me, then at each 
other. I was a convicted liar. Un- 
fair! I’d told at least half the truth, 
and the rest was a puppeteer secret. 
They’d paid me a small “consultant’s 
fee” to make it a privileged communi- 
cation. I shrugged it off and gulped 
at my after-dinner drink. 

I was trying to cough it out of 
my windpipe when Elephant breezed 
in. “The ship’s ready!” he shouted 
from the vestibule. “We take off in 
a week! What’s the trouble, Bay?” 
By then he was on the balcony. 

I got my breathing under control. 
“Week? Take off? Ship?” 

“Didn’t I mention any of this? 
Gronk. I guess I didn’t. Bay, I want 
to go back to the protosun. I’ve got 
a GP #2 hull covered a foot deep 
in foam plastic. There’s a foot of 
glass over the windows; we can ditch 


that if it frosts up. We’ll build up 
speed with an oversized gravity drag. 
Want to come along?” 

The thing he was carrying was 
four feet long, metal, covered with 
rolled cloth which was slightly 
lumpy. I recognized it as a vacuum 
flag, with spring wires in it, designed 
to look as if it’s waving where there’s 
no wind. 

He must have read my expression 
correctly .“No, idiot, I’m not going 
to land. What do you take me for? 
There’s a solid rocket in the mast. I 
want to plant it on Swoosh from a 
distance. It should make quite a 
flash, don’t you agree?” 

“You want me to go along?” 
“Sure.” 

“The ship sounds safe enough. 
We’ve got a week?” 

“Just about. There’s provisioning.” 
“I’ll let you know in plenty of 
time.” ~ 

We take off tomorrow. I’ve got a 
tridee camera bolted solidly to the 
control board, and a contract with 
the biggest broadcasting company in 
known space. They’ll have exclusive 
rights on the first macroscopic anti- 
matter explosion ever recorded. This 
time I’ve got a reason for going.

THE 

HUGO 

AND THE by LIN CARTER 

NEBULA 


L ast month in this column we 
were discussing the annual sci- 
ence-fiction achievement awards that 
are passed out every year at the 
World Science Fiction Convention. 
These little rocketships of stainless 
steel are called “Hugo Awards” in 
affectionate respect for Hugo Gerns- 
back, founder of the first science- 
fiction magazine in the world, Amaz- 
ing Stories. Actually, as Sam Mosk- 
owitz (Fandom’s unofficial his- 
torian) points out, Mr. Gernsback 
not only founded the first — but the 
first seven sf mags in history. 

Hugos were first given out at the 
11th World SF Convention held in 
Philadelphia, 1953. The convention 
in San Francisco the next year 
omitted Hugo awards, but the cus- 
tom was reinstituted at Cleveland in 
1955 and has continued ever since. 
Hugos have been awarded at thir- 
teen all-but-consecutive conventions, 
including Cleveland ’66, the most 
recent. Six or seven awards are 
made in different categories, such 


as best novel, best prozine (news- 
stand-distributed sf magazine), best 
short story or novelette, best fan- 
zine, best illustrator and (sometimes) 
for best sf movie or tv show, most 
promising new author, best book 
publisher, etc. The exact categories 
are up to choice of the committee 
that puts on each convention. 

Now let’s look at some of the 
Hugo-winners. 

Hugo-Winning Novels 

You may often have quibbles with 
Hollywood, when an airy bit of 
fluff like The Sound of Music wins 
the Oscar as “best picture of the 
year” . you may get mad at the 
Pulitzer people when they pass over 
a novel like Catch-22 in favor of 
something nobody read or even 
heard of . but I’m happy to say, 
the Hugos are usually and almost in- 
variably awarded to very deserving 
people. The first Hugo-winning 
novel, for example, was Alfred Bes- 


114 


ter’s The Demolished Man, one of 
the best and most important science- 
fiction novels of the 1950’s. Could 
you quarrel with that choice — or 
with Walter M. Miller’s A Canticle 
for Leibowitz (which won at Seattle 
in 1961) or Philip K. Dick’s The 
Man in the High Castle (Washing- 
ton, D.C., 1963)? I wouldn’t, any- 
way. 

Sometimes the Hugo novel doesn’t 
seem quite up to Hugo standards, 
but (as was certainly the case with 
Fritz Leiber’s whopping Wanderer , 
which won a Hugo at London in 
1965), whether it seems to quite 
measure up to previous Hugo win- 
ners or not, the novel that gets the 
award is almost always “the best of 
the year.” 

Taking an over-all look at the 
Mst, we see that Robert A. Heinlein 
has won three Hugos (for Double 
Star, 1956; Starship Troopers , 1960; 
and A Stranger in a Strange Land, 
1962). Most of the field’s top wri- 
ters have copped a Hugo or two: Eric 
Frank Russell, Murray Leinster, 
Jack Vance, Damon Knight, James 
Blish, Arthur C. Clarke, Avram 
Davidson, Poul Anderson, Brian 
Aldiss, Clifford D. Simak, Fritz 
Leiber . but there have been some 
very odd omissions. 

Whatever Happened To ... ? 

Consider Arthur C. Clarke, Poul 
Anderson, Damon Knight and Jack 
Vance. These men have produced 
some of the most marvelous sf novels 
of all time ... yet Clarke has only 
won a single Hugo (for a short 
story called The Star in 1956), An- 


derson came away with two (des- 
pite his many superlative novels, he 
only won for a short story, The 
Longest Voyage in 1961, and for a 
“short fiction” called No Truce with 
Kings in 1964), and poor Damon 
Knight got his lone Hugo for his 
criticism ! Jack Vance received a 
Hugo for The Dragon Masters, but, 
although it was long enough for 
Ace Books to issue it as a novel, the 
novel award that year (1963) went 
to Phil Dick, and Vance was left 
with “best short fiction.” 

And consider that no Hugos for 
fiction have ever gone to L. Sprague 
de Camp, Frederik Pohl, Ray Brad- 
bury, A.E. Van Vogt, Theodore 
Sturgeon or Keith Laumer (who 
certainly should have been Hugoed 
as “most promising new author”). 

Then look at the artists. In a field 
filled with brilliant illustrators, how 
come certain artists virtually mono- 
polize the Hugo for art? Frank 
Kelly Freas, admittedly a good man 
with pen or brush, won no less than 
four Hugos (1955, ’56, ’58, and ’59). 
Yet Virgil Finlay and Hannes Bok 
had to be content with one lonely 
Hugo each. Even worse, Ed Emsh- 
willer carried off a whole armful 
of Hugos (in 1952, ’60, ’61, ’62, and 
1964), yet Richard Powers, who has 
been adorning Ballantine Book’s 
covers gorgeously for 15 years, hasn’t 
won so much as one. 

The Magazines 

Things get even less fair when we 
turn to the prozines. The Magazine 
of Fantasy & Science Fiction won 
Hugos in 1958, ’59, ’60, and ’63. 


THE HUGO AND THE NEBULA 


115 



Astounding (which, in midstream, 
changed its name to Analog) has a 
whole shelf-full — eight Hugos — 
yet Galaxy only won a single Hugo 
in 1953, and that was on a tie with 
ASF. The other magazines (yes, 
Virginia, there are other science-fic- 
tion magazines in America) have 
thus far been unlucky.* It doesn’t 
seem quite fair, does it, for two 
magazines to come away with all 
but two of the fourteen Hugos thus 
far given out to the prozines! 

Happily, though, at the latest con- 
vention, the Hugo broke out of the 
ASF/F&SF deadlock at last. The 
Hugo went to . but we’ll get to 
the 1966 Tricon Hugos in just a 
bit! 

A New Award: The Nebula 

Under the leadership of Damon 
Knight, a new professional organi- 
zation called “Science Fiction Wri- 
ters of America” has come into be- 
ing. A sort of sf writers’ union, the 
SFWA issues a bulletin that serves 
as a sounding board for ideas and 
news and criticism, to say nothing of 
its service as a common meeting- 
ground where established veteran 
writers and first-sale newcomers can 
share know-how on contracts, the 
crotchets of various editors and pub- 
lishers and so on. 

The SFWA in March, 1966, pre- 
sented the first of a series of an- 
nual “Nebula” awards, in two din- 
ners given simultaneously at the 


• The British prozine, New Worlds, won 
a Hugo for “best professional magazine, 
British.” That was at the 1957 con- 
vention in London, so it figures. — LC 


Overseas Press Club in New York 
and at McHenry’s Tail O* the Cock 
in Beverly Hills. 

The Nebula was designed by 
Judith Ann Lawrence (Mrs. James 
Blish), from a design created by 
Kate Wilhelm (Mrs. Damon 
Knight), and executed by Daniel 
Levy of the Richley Company in 
New York. It consists of a spiral 
nebula made of metallic glitter, sus- 
pended over a crystal other-world- 
ly landscape, all of which is “fro- 
zen” within a rectangular block of 
transparent lucite, with the rele- 
vant information engraved on the 
base. Very nifty. 

Winners of these first Nebulas in 
history were Frank Herbert, for 
Dune as best novel of the year; Brian 
W. Aldiss, for The Saliva Tree and 
Roger Zelazny, for He Who Shapes 
— this was a tie for best novella — 
and, for best novelette (I’m not sure 
what the difference is between 
a “novelette” and a “novella” but 
never mind), Roger Zelazny, for 
The Doors of His Face, the Lamps 
of His Mouth . Last Nebula went to 
Harlan Ellison, for u Repent, Harle- 
quin!” , Said the Ticktockman, as best 
short story. 

You will note that Roger Zelazny, 
still a newcomer to science-fiction 
writing, walked away with two 
Nebulas! 

The 1966 Hugos 

Over the Labor Day weekend, the 
1966 World Science Convention was 
held in Cleveland, Ohio. The con- 
vention, I am told, had something 
like 1100 paid members, some 850 


116 


IF 



of whom actually attended the Tri- 
con, as the convention was called. 

The high point of every world 
convention, for me at least, is the 
Hugo presentation ceremonies. This 
year Hugos were given in six cate- 
gories: best novel, best short fiction, 
best prozine, best fanzine, best artist 
and best all-time series. 

Hugo for best novel of 1966 was 
— for the first time in Hugo his- 
tory — a tie . Duplicate awards were 
made to Frank Herbert for Dune 
and to Roger Zelazny for his And 
Call Me Conrad. (In the paperback 
edition, Zelazny’s novel is called This 
Immortal ) . 

Hugo for best short fiction went 
to former fan Harlan Ellison for — 
you guessed it! — “Repent, Harle- 
quin !” , Said The Ticktockman. No- 
tice how the Hugos agree very close- 
ly with the Nebulas; even to in- 
cluding Zelazny’s The Doors of His 
Face, the Lamps of His Mouth as a 
contender for the Hugo for short 
fiction. It was nominated, but did 
not win; Zelazny still managed to 
carry off at least one Hugo to set 
with his two Nebulas, though. 

Hugo for best artist of the year 
went to Frank Frazetta, one of the 
best artists of any year in science 
fiction, but particularly popular for 
his glorious covers on so many of 
the Edgar Rice Burroughs paper- 
backs. Best fanzine Hugo went to 
ERBdom , which you’ll remember we 
discussed in this column a few issues 
back. ERBdom is one of the “Bur- 
roughs fanzines” as you might guess 
from the title. 

A special Hugo in a category new 
this year went to Isaac Asimov for 


his famous Foundation series. This 
category was “best all-time series,” 
and the award strikes me as a good 
idea. I like the notion of a Hugo- 
in-retrospect. In fact, I suggest that 
future conventions consider the idea 
of presenting one Hugo each year for 
a writer’s over-all contribution to 
the field . like the Edgar which 
the Mystery Writers of America give 
out at their award banquets to 
“Grand Masters.” 

It would be nice to establish a 
special Hugo for Grand Masters in 
science fiction. This way, today’s 
sf fans could honor those major 
writers who did the bulk of their 
work in the science-fiction field 
years before the Hugo awards were 
even thought of. Burroughs, for ex- 
ample, or Doc Smith, Olaf Staple- 
don, Jack Williamson, Edmond 
Hamilton . lots of fine writers 
spring to mind, writers whose con- 
tributions to our field are worth a 
Grand Master award. I think this 
is a good idea, and I hope future 
conventions will consider it. 

But I’ve saved the most exciting 
Hugo of 1966 for last. Best pro- 
fessional magazine of the year: this 
year the Hugo went to Worlds of If! 

Everyone connected with If is 
thrilled with the Hugo, including 
Your Man In Fandom. As witness 
this special issue. 

I f you couldn’t make the Cleveland 
convention, start planning now for 
1967. If you didn’t agree with the 
choice of the ’66 Hugo winners, 
come to the convention in ’67 and 
vote yourself!

Dear Editor Pohl: 

Our remaining member of the 
Sepia Springs Science Fiction Club, 
Mr. Wright, says that Earth science 
fiction is extremely important, and 
that science-fiction editors are even 
more important, and that you are the 
leading science-fiction editor on 
Earth. At the moment I shall assume 
that you are an important person 
as far as this planet is concerned. 

To the extent that this assump- 
tion is correct, I must depend upon 


you to help me and inadvertently 
this rather trivial planet of yours. 

This you must do. First, simply 
refrain from printing any letters 
from anyone in Sepia Springs except 
those of mine. Mr. Wright, who first 
contacted us, persuaded us to oper- 
ate within the framework of his 
science-fiction club when he learned 
that the Galactic Council had sent 
us to Earth to evaluate how Earth 
might best be utilized by the Galaxy. 

This has not been altogether too 
successful up to now. Three mem- 
bers left as soon as we arrived. Two 
of them out the door and one 
through a window. The fourth, Joe

Smith, a more obnoxious sort, looked 
at Rhudly, the porcelain man and 
said, “Snow White! That’s worse 
than black! In fact, all of you be- 
long under a flat rock!” Then, turn- 
ing to Elaysia, he told her, “That 
goes for you too. Miss Overen- 
dowed! Six is uncouth!” / 

Mr. Wright explained, “Misguid- 
ed survival instincts — we usually 
call it ‘race prejudice.’” 

I don’t know everything, but I 
do know what is right, and I must 
say you will be wise to do as I 
direct you at all times.

Ah, well, you, Sir, have been

there a decent seafood house on

Hi! What a blast! Mr. Wright told 
all of us to write lots of letters to 
you because you don’t do anything 
but sit around and read all day. You 
humans play rough! Lucky I’m a 
tough silicoid creature. The Club 
went out last night to watch the 
Sepia Springs fireworks. We carried 
our “IF” signs to show that we were 
true s.f. fans. A native spotted me 
by the light of a rocket blast and 
yelled, “Hey, Charlie, look — a 
plucked parrot with an ‘IF’ sign! 
What’s an ‘IF,’ something to eat?” 

The one called Charlie said, “Par- 
rots don’t have webbed feet and they 
don’t carry signs like rabble-rousers. 
I don’t know what it is so let’s get 
rid of it.” 

Then the first one said, “Char- 
lie, you are a real philosopher. Let’s 
tie it to a rocket and give the kids 
a thrill to go with their popcorn.” 

That was quite a ride! 

After I dug myself - out of the 
ground, I felt a little dizzy so I 
went back to the club house for the 
night. 

The club sort of broke up the 
celebrations or started one.. Some 
native women spotted Elaysia, called 
her a “damn-show-off,” and started 
throwing empty bottles at her. Mr. 
Wright took Elaysia away. He is al- 
ways doing that for one reason or 
another. 

It was all a lot of fun.

Dear Mr. Pohl: 

I’m trying to do my job and tak- 
ing time, just to please Mr. Wright, 
to keep you informed on events. 
Events aren’t too promising. 

It is like this. I went into “The 
Counter,” and had lunch. The people 
stared at me but I expect that on an 
isolated planet. 

When I went out onto the street, 
a couple of husky young ranch hands 
stepped up to each side of me and 
grabbed my arms. I could have 
tossed them half across the street 
but regulations say that I’m sup- 
posed to make every effort to co- 
operate with local inhabitants. 

The dark-haired man said, “You 
know, chum, this climate is going 
to get awfully cold for the likes of 
you in the winter time. Forty below, 
you know!” 

I politely said, “Thank you for 
your concern. I can stand a greater 
temperature range than that. My sur- 
vival index is the highest of any 
known race in the galaxy.” 

The light fellow said, “We don’t 
give a damn about your survival in- 
dex or whatever you call it. Just 
be a good fellow and let us put you 
on the bus and send you south.” 

I told him: “I appreciate your 
interest, gentlemen, but I have a job 
to do here and I never shirk my 
duty.” 


“Don’t feel bad, chum,” said the 
dark one, “no one is going to miss 
you. We are your friends. Nothing 
personal in this, chum, but we want 
to help you get out of town for 
your own good.” 

“Nice of you to look after me. I 
hadn’t realized you people were so 
thoughtful of your fellow man.” 
The light one dug an elbow into 
my ribs. I think it hurt him a little. 
He winced and said, “Hell! What 
do you wear, armor? Lay off this 
goddamned ‘fellow man’ stuff. We 
took up a collection to buy you a 
ticket and here it is for Los Angeles, 
they will never notice you there.” 
The dark one planted a boot heel 
on my toe. It would probably have 
mashed an Earth foot. He glared at 
me. “So you gonna take the friendly 
gift and beat it, or are we gonna 
have to see you again with less 
friendly ideas?” 

I told them I was sorry but I had 
to stay. Then I let them hit me and 
kick me. They both split their fists 
on my jaw and ran away holding 
their hands and swearing. It is a 
handicap being sort of a superman. 
I can't even make love to a woman 
not of my own race, because I’d 
squash them. Elaysia looks good to 
me, but I have to let Wright have 
her. 

Most sincerely yours, 
Rhudly

people. This town is called Sepia 
Springs because the city water sup- 
ply goes through Jim “Jolly” Green’s 
sheep lambing pens before the city 
picks it up for their water supply. 
“Jolly” is the city water commission- 
er and gets a monthly rental for the 
city use of his lambing pens besides 
his salary. He’s a good man. 

Forget the seafood idea. I just 
made a deal with a local cafe. They 
have trouble getting good fresh crab. 
Back home we have a problem with 
overpopulation. I happen to have 
connections with an interstellar 
shipper who has great respect for 
the dollar. 

By the way, I know a lithographer 
in Cheyenne who can lithograph that 
mag of yours in three colors for half

never have been admitted to Galac-

Dear Sir & Editor: 

I regret, my dear friend, that

the five thousand dollars to help 
finance the ammunitions effort. I 
had hoped to give you a little rake- 
off after the blood dried up and I 
had accessed my own personal ex- 
penses. As usual, I managed quite 
well on my own. The arms have been 
sold. A local banker, who had been 
indiscreet with another man’s wife, 
saw fit to better himself by financ- 
ing me. Lilly Bell and Hogal are in- 
dignant, but things are going so 
smoothly that the matter is com- 
pletely out of their control. 

I don’t think that there will be 
one brick left on another or one 
window intact in Sepia Springs in 
a few days. I now have a substantial 
account in a Swiss bank. However, 
it is temporarily encumbered with 
red tape. If you could advance me 
a mere ten thousand it will make you 
a hundred thousand in two months. 
That could finance some format 
improvements for “IF,” you know. 
You might drop me the ten thou- 
sand in cash to my new headquar-

erative type, and I am told that 
he has what humans call an “ex- 
uberant sense of humor.” Whatever 
it is, I appreciate that he has called 
at the jail yard, where they let me 
walk one hour a day. 

It happened like this. I went into 
the fifth bar, and it wasn’t a nice 
place, but they served me a drink. 
I was sitting in my booth sipping 
an Earth type called “Jack Daniels” 
when this beautiful young Earth girl 
came in and sat on my lap and put 
her arms around me. She made me 
feel good. I do have glands, you 
know, under this tough white hide. 
I was on my fourth “Jack Daniels” 
and afraid even to lift her off my lap 
for fear I might crush her bones. She 
started kissing me. She wore purple 
lipstick, which probably looks bad 
on white skin. 

Then in came three men, and one 
of them said, “You freak S.O.B.! 
You’re fooling around with my 
wife!” 

He pulled out a hand gun and 
shot me five times. The last bullet 
hit the end of my nose, and I guess 
I lost my temper. I jumped up, 
dumped the girl on the floor, and 


THE SEPIA SPRINGS AFFAIR

swung my fist at the man. I caught 
myself in mid-swing and tried to 
stop, but I did barely knick him on 
the chin. He is in the hospital with 
a broken jaw, cracked neck and con- 
cussion. 

If he dies, the guard tells me, I’ll 
be hung for murder. Gleep says 
hanging me is about the funniest 
thing he ever heard of. I read about 
humor once, and I guess he is right, 
but I just can’t experience the emo- 
tion. 

The guards hit me with a rub- 
ber hose. I told them that if it 
would make them feel any better 
they could use a piece of pipe. That

upset them. I must have violated a 
cultural taboo. The council warned 
us against that. 

I could break out of here easily, 
but courtesy demands that I re- 
main here and not offend my host 
until relieved of duty by the Galac- 
tic Council. 

Patiently,

Dear Sir & Editor: 

I tell you I know when to jump 
orbits. The general area of Sepia 
Springs is occupied by Snerr’s mis- 
begotten offspring. And if your 
Pentagon brass knew what was go- 
ing on here, they’d drop an H bomb

me selling my relatives for crab

own brand of evil, and even that 
changes with the winds of time. The 
only true virtue is achievement, my

what it is. I need $20,000 for guns

I can make you a million, my friend,

never had such a good offer in your

Dear Editor Pohl: 

Since you are so inadvertently in- 
volved with us, I will write this let- 
ter to you. This is unofficial, of 
course. 

Sepia Springs did not recognize 
good will and innocence in Hurd and 
Moby, because they were, to your 
kind, big and ugly. The SSSFC let 
Snerr dominate it because she was 
an aggressive bitch and no one 
stopped her. Lilly Bell, Hogal and 
Klip conned you from the start. 
They were too non-human to date 
your daughters and seemed to offer 
an easy way to get something for 
nothing. Gleep is a happy-go-lucky 
character with a tough hide. He just 
invites abuse from # sour dispositioned 
societies. But, like me, he is too 
tough to get hurt. Elaysia can pri- 
marily test the tolerance of Earth 
women and some of them evidently 
can’t stand the competition. Elaysia 
is from a race of great lovers. 

I am human even if I am tough 
and I could date your daughters, and 
I look like you except for my por- 
celain white skin, which reflects light 
nicely and prevents sunburn. Hu- 
mans get badly shaken the moment

they face me — except for Mr. 
Wright, and he thinks I’m funny, 
which I am not. I don’t really have 
much of a sense of humor, but that 
is a cultural characteristic of my 
race. In any event, I’m human even 
if I am white. I must recommend a 
guarantee of Earth. 

Regretfully, 

Rhudly 

P. S. I talked to Wright on the

more vitamins. Perhaps you can help 
him?

Oh, where are the moss-covered, ochre Barsoomian plains, 

With thoat-riding, sword- wielding, ruddy-skinned heroes so gay, 
And wandering war-bands of Warhoons in zitidar wains? 

The cold wind of science has blown them away. 


And what has become of the boundless Venerian bog, 

Where slimy and sinuous reptile did slither and slay, 

And princesses fled from malevolent foes through the fog? 

The brisk breeze of knowledge has blown them away. 

And what of the fountains and fanes of Atlantis the fair, 

Which rose from the waves in the West — or so Plato did say — 
Its sorcerer-kings, and its spires of orichalc rare? 

in the dry blast of reason they’ve withered away. 

But if Venus and Mars become lifeless and dull, and if no 
Atlantis existed outside a poetical lay, 

These luminous figments live on in our fancy, although 
The breath of discovery wafts them away.

The 

Iron Thorn 

by Algis Budrys 


Illustrated by MORROW 


What has gone before 

Honor Jackson was a loner , he 
roamed * round the world . The world 
was flat and circular; a sunken des- 
ert , cold, wanly lit, nearly airless. At 
its center was the Thorn — a high, 
blunt, nearly featureless metal tower. 
It was the precarious source of the 
only water, breath and livable clim- 
ate for the Farmers . 


The Farmers tilled the fields 
packed around the Thorn, and sup- 
ported the Honors. Honors occasion- 
ally ventured out into the desert 
wearing portable climate units they 
thought were hats, and honned Am - 
sirs. Amsirs were vicious, horn-clad, 
flightless, winged animals who would 
have gotten in and eaten up all the 
Farmers if the Honors hadn't pro- 
tected them. 

Like a lot of other things, Honor 


132 


Jackson found out when he became 
a full-fledged Honor , that was pret- 
ty much a lie , maintained by the 
Eld Honor and his bully-boys for 
their own comfort . For one thing , 
the Amsirs were less vicious , better 
armed , 0m/ had a bigger vocabulary 
than the Honors. To say nothing of 
the Farmers. 

Being nobody’s fool , Jackson was 
pretty much on his way to being just 
about everybody’s enemy. So he left 
the Thorn , left his solitary home and 
all his drawings, left his life, left even 
Petra Jovans — who just might have 
come along if he’d asked her — and 
went out into the desert, where a 
man would choke and freeze to 
death in a dozen dozen heartbeats if 
he lost his cap or got out of line-of- 
sight of the Thorn. 

He took his Amsir-bone throwing 
stick and his two glass-headed darts 
with him. Even so, Red Filson 
chased him down; he got one of 
Filson’ s darts through his elbow and 
damn near died before he could kill 
the man and surrender to a Amsir. 

The Amsir dressed him in warm 
robes of human skin and took him 
to the rim of the world, where he 
found the rim of another world, full 
of thick air, choked to the rim with 
food, and centering on a Thorn 
much more magnificent than his 
own. Soaring around the Thorn were 
Amsirs. 

The food, unfortunately, could 
only be eaten by Amsirs; to Jackson's 
kind of creature it was just so much 
rock-mold. And despite anything a 
Amsir doctor could do for him, his 
arm was dying. 

It turned out the Amsirs had a 


habit of capturing Jackson’s kind of 
creature because only Jackson’s kind 
of creature could help them with 
their problem . 

Their problem was a smaller , 
somewhat Thorn-like thing standing 
up on the ground beside their Thorn. 
Like their Thorn and Jackson’s 
Thorn it had been there since the 
beginning of time . Jackson’s kind of 
creature could at least mess around 
its outside, even if fruitlessly. But 
no Amsir could get at it. It killed 
them. 

The Amsirs, science-minded as 
well as inclined to theological dispu- 
tation, felt all the answers to the 
origin of the world and the mainten- 
ance of the gradually deteriorating 
Thorns might lie inside the Thorn 
Thing. In any case, they couldn’t 
ignore it, so one after another of 
Jackson’s kind had been trying to 
open the adamantly closed door to 
the Thorn Thing for the Amsirs, 
spurred by the hope-, there might 
be something to eat in there. Up 
till now they had all starved to 
death . 

The Amsir equivalent of the Eld 
had some hope Jackson would show 
better luck. Jackson, after all, was 
the first of his kind to surrender 
voluntarily, and he was obviously 
intelligent in other ways besides. 

The Eld Amsir didn’t feel he could 
take too many chances with Jackson. 
So he set a guard on him — Ahmuls, 
the incredibly stupid, half-baked, 
flabby-skinned, wingless Amsir 
whom the Thorn Thing apparently 
mistook for Jackson’s kind of crea- 
ture, because it didn’t try to kill him , 
either. It just wouldn’t open its door, 


THE IRON THORN 


133 



and meanwhile kept growling some- 
thing in its low , ugly voice . 

Jackson finally got mad at the 
door and spoke to it . In fact , he 
reasoned with it, was what he did, 
and the door opened . It turned out 
the door had been trying to speak 
the speech of Amsirs and Jackson* s 
kind of creature — it just didn*t 
speak fast enough . When the door 
opened, and Jackson and Ahmuls 
found themselves inside a very small 
room, it kind of went to show that 
both Jackson and Ahmuls were the 
Thorn Thing* s kind of creature, too . 

This series of events unquestion- 
ably held deep scientific and theo- 
logical meaning to the Eld Amsir. 
But he reacted just as if he were 
hopping mad . When the outside door 
closed again, there were spears re- 
bounding from it . Meanwhile, in- 
side, Jackson and Ahmuls crouched 
nervously as the other door of the 
little room slipped back, and they 
were able to see into the inside of 
the Thorn Thing. 

XVI 

6 4tt T hat’s happening?” Ahmuls 
VV said unhappily, peering in- 
to the Thorn Thing, jerking his head 
back to look over his shoulder every 
time another spear point hit the 
other side of the door, but then peer- 
ing again. Things were beginning to 
hum inside the Thorn Thing. Jack- 
son could see light getting brighter, 
dancing around in there; he could 
hear things going clickety-click. Most 
of all he could feel how strong the 
Thorn was becoming. All around 
them, a voice like the voice of the 


door said: “Uhhcumminngg uhup t 
full pow'r!” Farther inside the Thorn 
Thing the same voice said: “Stand- 
ing by on full power. Main genera- 
tors On, maintenance power supply 
Off! Condition of vessel report: All 
systems functional and reliable. 
Maintenance Mode battery drain ex- 
cessive; recharging.” 

“What’s happening 1 ?” Ahmuls 
cried. 

“Don’t look at me, chum,” Jack- 
son said quickly, “I haven’t picked 
up any weapons.” 

“You better not!” 

“I know.” Jackson had his feet 
firmly under him and moved to the 
doorway that led deeper inside the 
Thorn Thing. “Will you look at all 
that machinery.” 

“What are we going to do! Who’d 
want to stay in here!” Ahmuls 
wailed. 

Jackson listened to the tang! tang! 
tang! of spears hitting the outside of 
the Thorn Thing. “Oh, I don’t 
know,” he said. 

“Is anyone going to take com- 
mand?” the door-voice said inside 
the Thing. 

I haven’t worked that out yet, 
friend, Jackson said to himself. Any 
minute now this clown is going to 
decide something’s a weapon. It’s a 
little hard, taking command when 
you’re dead. But I’m sure not going 
to take my orders from him — he’s 
worse even than Eld. 

Jackson felt funny. There was all 
this humming and buzzing; all these 
voices talking and doors opening; 
all these things happening that he 
maybe could have enjoyed if he’d 
come on them a little bit at a time, 


134 


IF 



all ready to take them on or maybe 
take them apart. Maybe be them, 
or maybe picture them. But with a 
stomach and an arm and spear 
sounds and an Ahmuls like he had, 
he didn’t feel all that ready. 

“Command must be exercised 
within a reasonable period of time,” 
the voice said. 

“Huh?” Ahmuls said. 

“Command must be exercised! 
Stasis wastes power!” 

Nag, nag, nag, Jackson thought. 
Whatever stasis is. “All right,” he 
yelled. “What’ll make you happy?” 

6 4 Tj' unction. Duties to perform. I 
A 1 cannot come to full power for 
nothing!” 

“Listen, you quit talking to it!” 
Ahmuls said. “You've done enough 
already.” 

“Listen, no weapons, right?” Jack- 
son said to him, holding out his 
empty hands. “I’m supposed to talk 
to it, remember?” He raised his 
voice. “You got a name, voice?” 
Ahmuls was frowning, Jackson 
guessed. Maybe he’d stay busy that 
way just a little bit longer. 

“My name is Self-Sustaining In- 
terplanetary Expeditionary Module,” 
the voice said. “Call me Susiem.” 
“What can you do?” 

“Anything! Anything a Susiem can 
do.” 

You wouldn’t think that was a lot 
of help, Jackson thought. But there 
was one thing he knew a Susiem 
could do, and it was with doors. He 
bounced off Ahmuls to get farther 
inside the Thorn Thing. “Close that 
door!” he yelled, and as he lay there 
on the floor again, he found that 


to the now more distant and less fre- 
quent sound of spears against the 
outside door was added the soft 
klop! of Ahmuls, trapped in the lit- 
tle room, beating his fist against the 
inside door. 

Jackson shook his head and look- 
ed around. The room he was in was 
full of machinery; metal and glass 
all over the place, humped, twisted, 
full of knobs and points, flashing and 
gleaming, humming — 

“That’s great. But I don’t see any- 
thing to eat.” 

“Certainly not! Do you think 
you’re in the mess compartment?” 
Susiem said. 

“You trying to say there’s an- 
other room here, where there’s 
food?” 

“I can do anything a Susiem can 
do!” Susiem said. 

Klop , klop , klop, Ahmuls said. 

“Boy, he talks plainer than you 
do,” Jackson said. “All right, how 
do I get to that other room? And 
don’t open that door until I say 
so! By the way, if you’ve got food, 
you wouldn’t happen to have a doc- 
tor? I could use one.” 

“Certainly I won’t open the door! 
You’re in command! Report to Sick 
Bay immediately.” 

“They got food there?” 

“Medical treatment takes prece- 
dence over rations. Report to Sick 
Bay.” 

I’m in command, Jackson thought. 
“Where's Sick Bay?” 

XVII 

S usiem led him back to Sick Bay

lights that kept turning on just ahead 
of him as he walked through a door 
and then down a ladder and through 
another door. Sick Bay was all white 
except where it was hare metal. The 
doctor was white and bare metal, 
and he had wheels. He unstoppered 
himself from a doctor-shaped hole 
in the wall and came rolling forward 
like a plow. He came to about the 
height of Jackson’s chest. “State 
your complaint,” he said. 

“My arm’s going to have to come 
off,” Jackson said, looking at the 
doctor carefully, deciding to believe 
Susiem when it said “This is the 
doctor.” 

“You’re not competent to prog- 
nose. State your complaint. How do 
you account for the fact that you 
don’t match any comparison in my 
files? Show proof you’re entitled to 
receive medical treatment from this 
station.” 

“Emergency, Doctor,” Susiem 
said. “This man is in command.” 

“You’ll have to fill out forms,” the 
doctor said. A hard, soft-white 
square on its top turned a very pale 
white-green. A stick popped up most 
of the way out of a hole beside the 
square. “Take the pen.” Jackson 
pulled it out curiously. It was the 
same shape and about the same 
length as the burnt sticks he had left 
behind at his home Thorn. But it 
wasn’t burnt — it was light, felt 
soft at the surface but was as rigid 
as metal, felt slick, but didn’t slip 
from his fingers. At the very end of 
it was what looked like a little ball 
of glass. 

“Well?” 

Jackson peered at the green- 


white square. There were lines run- 
ning across it now, bright white. At 
the beginnings of the lines there 
were shapes of some kind — patterns 
made out of lines, bent and cross- 
ing each other. “Kind of pretty,” he 
said. 

“Criticism is not your function. 
Fill out the forms.” 

“I think he’s illiterate, Doctor,” 
Susiem said. 

“Well, let him make some kind of 
mark,” the doctor said impatiently. 
“I’m sure there are others waiting. 
He’s wasting time.” 

“He’s in command.” 

“Well, then he certainly ought to 
be literate.” 

6 ook — I order you to make 
yourself understandable,” 
Jackson told the doctor. “My arm 
hurts, and I’m hungry.” 

“Do you know how to make a 
mark? Make a mark on the sur- 
face of the plate with the light- 
pen. I have to have some sort of 
identification for you or I can’t file 
you. And if I can’t file you, you’re 
lost.” 

“Oh. You just want to be able to 
find me again. Well, here’s what I 
look like.” The little ball slipped 
much too easily over the top of the 
plate, if that was what you called 
it, but the light-pen, or whatever, left 
a nice white line behind it. Jack- 
son started turning his wrist to 
thicken and thin it, and that didn’t 
work, but by and large he had a 
pretty good picture of himself down 
on the plate very soon. For good 
measure, he took one corner of the 
plate and made a drawing of his arm

bones, showing where the dart had 
gone in. “That’s what’s wrong with 
me. The dart’s been pulled out, but 
the arm died.” 

The doctor and Susiem didn’t say 
anything for a little bit. Finally the 
doctor said: “Your knowledge of 
anatomy isn’t bad.” 

“Draws well, too,” Susiem said. 

“You can tell what you're looking at. 

Not like this paraphrastic stuff they 
do.” 

“The arm,” Jackson said. 

“Certainly the arm,” the doctor 
answered. “Uh — let’s just have 
an overall look at you, while we’re 
about it.” The doctor shimmied back 
and forth on his wheels for a 
moment. There was a little humming 
plow-noise inside him. “Hmm. 

Yes. Well — you’ve certainly led an 
active life. But it’s all healed very 
nicely — barring some of the fresh 
events, of course. The only one that 
we need to do anything much about 
is in that elbow joint. You’re go- 
ing to need a restoration there. Your 
blood sugar is a little low. Are you 
fatigued?” 

“Huh?” 

“Are you tired?” 

“Damn right. Hungry, too.” 

“Well, I can introduce a little pro- 
tein into your system, I suppose, 
while we’re working on the arm, 
but I imagine you’d rather have a 
ham sandwich. Susiem, why don’t 
you get the captain here some nour- 
ishment while I’m taking care of 
this.” The doctor came apart, part- 
way, with some kind of flip of his 
sides, which turned into a kind of 
chair-cradle. The seat and back, and 
the part that went under the legs, ^ — •

were padded, and so was the place 
for Jackson’s right arm to rest. A 
trough that extended partway into 
the back rest was for Jackson’s left 
arm. It was bare metal, and a little 
bar of light popped out on two 
stalks over it, lighting up the leather 
wrappings as Jackson sat down. 

660 ick call takes precedence over 
^ mess,” Susiem said. “I see 
no reason why he can’t be treated 
and then go to where the food is.” 
“I said bring him something!” the 
doctor snapped. “He’s undernourish- 
ed, he’s got one arm free to serve 
himself with, and besides, rank has 
its privileges.” 

“If you record it as a prescrip- 
tion, doctor.” 

“I do.” 

“Very well,” Susiem said. Some- 
thing began to stir around one com- 
partment lower down. “I'm break- 
ing out a food cart.” 

“For a machine,” Jackson said to 
the doctor, “you got more sense 
than people.” 

“Damn right,” the doctor said. 
“Now let’s get this slop off your 
limb. Who’s been treating you — 
some veterinarian?” 

“What’s thatV 

“Captain, you need an education.” 
“What’s that?” 

“What you need.” Maybe the doc- 
tor didn’t want to go ’round and 
’round any more; maybe he figured 
he could keep Jackson busy with 
something else. At any rate, some- 
thing that must have been a knife 
zipped down the length of Jackson’s 
arm. It laid open the wrappings as 
neat as any slash Jackson had ever 


seen. It laid open his arm too, and it 
sure did cut down on his desire to 
do much talking. He sat there star- 
ing at his own bones, pink-white, in 
the halved shell of his arm. All 
around the torn, discolored place 
where Red Filson’s dart had gone 
in on- its way to the elbow joint, 
it looked like something rotten. 

Sparks — maybe metal, maybe 
light — winked and flashed around 
the bone. There was a cloudy white 
puff of fog where the joint was; 
there was a suck of air and that was 
gone, whuummph ! and then the joint 
was gone. The bones of his upper 
and lower arm didn’t meet by a 
full third of a dozen finger-widths. 
More sparks, and the ends were 
notched and drilled, the way a car- 
penter might make a pegged splice. 
The rotten place in the meat of his 
arm was getting less. Healthy-look- 
ing stuff was replacing it. His whole 
arm was tingling. The bar of light 
above it seemed to be shivering. 

Something like a little doctor came 
rolling in the door, and flipped open 
its top. Steaming warmth hit Jack- 
son in the nose like the clout of a 
damp, hot, table rag. He’d never 
smelled anything so strong in his life. 
It poured right up his nose and 
seemed to fill his whole head. He 
blinked; it was making his eyes 
water. Lying on a dish were some 
greens with somethihg greasy-looking 
on them, a round ball of something 
white and made out of small parts 
that looked like maggots, and a 
rounded squishy-looking brown thing 
that looked like what you might find 
under a Amsir house, if it had been 
drier. Next to it was something with

IF 



a long slim handle and four long 
curved points, a folded-up white 
hunk of something that might have 
been Amsir lace shaved until it was 
thin and crinkly, and a glass of what 
would have looked like milk if it 
hadn’t been so white and opaque. 

“Lunch,” Susiem said. “Salisbury 
steak with roquefort salad and rice. 
Enjoy it, Captain.” Jackson couldn’t 
make up his mind whether to look 
at his lunch or his arm. 

\ 

T he doctor was really getting 
things done in there. Delicate 
stilty little fingers with hinges in 
them came popping out of his inside, 
from under the same overhang that 
the bar of light came from. They 
were carrying a woven white contrap- 
tion that Jackson saw was a little like 
what would happen if you took a 
drawing of an elbow joint and bent 
it around so that it was an elbow 
joint no matter what direction you 
looked at it from. He found this out 
because the little fingers stuck it 
right in there, and other little fingers 
put pegs in place, and in a trice 
where his elbow had been was this 
white drawing, snugly slipped into 
place. He could see right through it, 
of course, but it looked pretty strong 
and solid all by itself. 

“Okay,” the doctor said. “That’s 
what we call a jig-splint. In a couple 
of hours, you’ll have a pretty good 
structure of bone cells forming along 
that grid, and in a day or so that’ll 
be as good as new.” 

The two halves of Jackson’s arm 
were pushed back together as the 
walls of the trough gently squeezed 
shut around them. The trough wig- 


gled its halves back and forth tor an 
instant until the halves of Jackson 
were lined up just right. Then they 
fell back and where the cut had 
been there was a very thin line, like 
the scratch of a playful woman, run- 
ning along the seam. 

For the first time since the doc- 
tor started, Jackson saw blood. It 
stood up in droplets like pinheads 
along the scratch, already scabbed 
and hard. The cut lengths of the 
Amsir doctor’s arm-wrapping lay in 
the trough for an instant and then 
puffed out with a flash, a fog of 
smoke and a whooph ! “Eat your 
lunch,” the doctor said. 

Jackson tested his arm. The 
“lunch” still looked like what it had 
looked like before. The arm was 
great. He twisted and stretched it, 
making a fist, squeezing, trying to 
see if it would pop open into two 
halves. It wouldn’t. 

He rapped his elbow with the 
knuckles of his right hand. It sound- 
ed hollow. It didn’t sound like him 
at all. 

XVIII 

I t didn’t seem possible he had eaten. 

But Susiem had said: “If you 
think I’m going to throw away this 
perfectly good food, and go to the 
trouble of synthesizing burnt Amsir, 
if that’s what it’s called, and whole 
grain bread, when the whole basis of 
your being here is that you’re 
human ...” 

Jackson had to admit Salisbury 
steak, rice and roquefort salad wasn’t 
bad. He licked the leftovers off his 
fingers. But he drew the line at what 


THE IRON THORN 


139 



humans called milk; he finally got 
some water instead. 

He sat back. The doctor was still 
letting him sit in him. 

“You know,” Jackson said, “it’s 
funny how it works out. Here the 
Eld Amsir was jollying me along 
with lots of fine talk about maybe 
there was food in here, and some- 
thing to do about my arm, and be 
damned if there wasn’t. Feels pretty 
good. Thanks, the two of you.” 
“What are your further orders, 
Captain?” Susiem said impatiently. 

“Well ... I don’t know. Is there 
some place around here for me to 
sleep?” 

“You don’t need any right now,” 
the doctor said. 

v“ Sleepl ” Susiem said simultaneous- 
ly. “Here you’ve got everything turn- 
ed on, and you’re going to sleepl” 
“Well, it’s something us humans 
do. Whether they need it or not. 
Can’t tell when your next chance is 
going to be.” 

“Humans,” the doctor said, “sleep 
at set, regular times. The sort of 
humans we are accustomed to.” 
“That’s right,” Susiem said. “Stas- 
is wastes power!” 

Oh boy, it never stops, Jackson 
thought, even with machines. “Well, 
look — you must have had other 
captains — ” 

“I should say so!” 

“What did you do when they 
slept?” 

“When they slept, the First Offi- 
cer was awake. Don’t you know any- 
thing about being human?” 

“He needs an education,” the doc- 
tor said. 

“More than I need a first officer?” 


“What about the individual in the 
air lock? Isn’t that your first officer?” 
“Him?” All Ahmuls was in Jack- 
son’s head right now was a Klop, 
klop, klop on the inside door. That 
was enough. He still hadn’t decided 
what to do about that. But why did 
he have to decide now? It wasn’t 
as if he was going to spend the rest 
of his life anywhere else but here. 
Being captain. When the machines 
didn’t have something else in mind. 
“What’s a first officer do? I go 
one’s pretty good with a spear, I 
guess. But spearing don’t seem to be 
much needed. I mean, you’re made 
out of metal Doctor, and I don’t 
even know where you are, Susiem.” 
Susiem giggled. 

“All right, that does it,” the doctor 
said. “I’m prescribing this boy a 
university. You do have the neces- 
sary fact library, don’t you?” 
“Self-Sustaining Interplanetary Ex- 
peditionary Modules are, self-evi- 
dently, self-sustaining,” Susiem an- 
swered, as the doctor’s arms im- 
mediately, but gently, unfolded addi- 
tional sections that held Jackson by 
the wrists. The seat changed slope, 
so that he was mostly lying down. 

“No need to get offended about 
it. Just be ready to patch through 
into my inputs when I say the word. 
And no stirring around in my banks 
while we’re overlapping, either — 
everybody thinks all they need to be 
doctors themselves is facts. Just get 
the tibias and the cytoplasms in the 
right place and anybody can be a 
sawbones! That’s what you think. 
So stay out and do your job, and 
I’ll do mine.” 

What the hell were they up to? 

IF 


140 



Jackson made one try at getting his 
arms out, which taught him he 
couldn’t do it. Anyhow, supposing 
he’d get loose, where was he going 
to run to? Outside? Through the 
little room with Ahmuls klopping 
in it? But what the hell were they 
up to? Round pads came from some- 
where behind Jackson’s head and 
pressed it close among them, front 
and back, both sides. 

£ £ A 11 right, I’m hitting him with 
the predisposants now.” A 
little thing like a hollow spearpoint 
whipped out of the doctor’s insides, 
darted at Jackson’s throat, stopped 
short but close and fired something 
cold and stinging into the place 
where the heavy throb of blood came 
near the surface of the skin. Jackson 
felt it just for a heartbeat, and he 
was still admiring how fast the little 
dojigger moved and how keen it 
looked, when it flipped back and dis- 
appeared. 

“Massive dose,” the doctor com- 
mented. “I judge that with this in- 
dividual, he’d better be predisposed 
to about the same extent as you’d 
need to teach a horse symphonic 
composition.” 

Jackson could feel something very 
funny happening to his eyes and 
ears. Sounds were beginning to break 
up into little reverberating pieces. 
First the edges of everything he 
could see were blurred, and then 
he was weeping. Moisture — great, 
glittering streams of tears — pooled 
out on his helpless lids and sheeted 
down his face. A bulky, warm feel- 


ing spread out from the pit of his 
stomach. His fingers felt as if his 
palms were split painlessly and 
smoothly along each string of bones 
clear back to his wrists. The same 
time his eyes ran wet, his lips were 
puffy and dry, and the same time his 
belly was warm, his forehead was 
icy cold. He swallowed, and his ears 
popped. He blinked, and his tear- 
filled eyes felt sandy. “He’s ready,” 
the doctor said. 

There was another fine, cold spray 
at the back of Jackson’s neck. “In- 
puts going in now.” Something fine 
and ticklish as Petra Jovan’s hair 
came in through the back of Jack- 
son’s neck, slipped gracefully to the 
inside of his head, and for all he 
knew, wove themselves into tapes- 
tries there. “All right, patch in,” 
the doctor said. 

Whatever patching-in was, Jack- 
son guessed Susiem had done it, be- 
cause suddenly, inside his head, 
where he was, there was a feeling 
like — A thing happening like — 
Well, what was happening, was that, 
in there, and around there, what was 
being done — no; what was hap- 
pening — 

“Who could I tell?” Jackson hol- 
lered at the top of his lungs. “Who 
would believe me!” 

XIX 

I t was no different really from 
remembering it was like being a 
boy around the Thorn. One day he 
was just another brat — well, just 
another brat except he was inside 
himself — and the next day he was 


THE IRON THORN

here in the expeditionary ship re- 
membering it. It was probably no 
different from that. 

“Well?” the doctor said. 

“He’s done,” Susiem said. 

The taste of hot dust swirling up 
around the Thorn as he ran, and 
ran, was in his mouth. The feel of 
the first time he swung his arm just 
right and the dart shot straight and 
true into the target, a buzzing streak 
of what Honor White Jackson could 
do. Honor Black Jackson. Honor 
Red Jackson. Honor Red Jackson, 
hurting and hungry, being a door 
in the alien echoes of the Amsir 
Thorn. And now he was here. Mem- 
ory had no time or space. 

His head was very full. 

Hey! he thought, I was right all 
along! I was too small — it was 
all too small, and it was all wrong. 
I was right and they were wrong. 

When he thought of how they 
tried to keep him down, and how 
they kept themselves down, he be- 
gan to grin. When he thought about 
the Amsirs, poking and prying, try- 
ing to understand it all — from 
where they were — he grinned even 
more fiercely. Oh, wow — mine is 
the Earth and everything that’s in it! 

“Congratulations, Captain,” Su- 
siem said, “you are now an Honor 
graduate in Liberal Arts from Ohio 
State University. You have a special 
Masters in Command Psychology 
from the University of Chicago, and 
three semester hours in military 
journalism from the Air Force 
Academy. You are fully qualified to 
command this vessel.” 

“I know that,” Jackson said. 

“These qualifications are now on 


file in my data banks, and will be 
listed with Earth Central Statistics 
immediately upon my reacquisition 
of contact with the Associated Mid- 
western Universities Genetic Re- 
search project communications net- 
work,” Susiem went on, tidying up 
the loose ends. 

6£rr^here’s no way you can tease 
A him out of that airlock and 
back down the ladder, is there?” 
he said, pro forma, but he didn’t 
want to do that anyway. Poor bloody 
Ahmuls. If he got him out of the 
lock and back to the Eld Amsir’s 
love, what use would they have for 
him with the ship gone? And the 
ship would be gone. He most certain- 
ly wasn’t going to spend his life 
grounded aboard her now, even sup- 
posing her life support system could 
endure that long with his organism 
draining it. But that was secondary, 
too — in fact, irrelevant. For who, 
knowing him as he was how, knowing 
how much time there was to make 
up for could imagine him going any- 
where but Earthward? 

Earthward to Ariwol, he noted 
parenthetically. Earthward to Air- 
world. The tongue of his mind twist- 
ed voluptuously around the ability to 
make the long vowels flow; he took 
a deep, deep breath — breath enough 
to make him giddy — and said it 
aloud the way they might say it in 
Columbus, Ohio and Chicago, Illi- 
nois: “Ayer world.” So much, so 
much to use! 

Klop klop klop . 

Kick him out, struggling, to ridi- 
cule and scorn, to uselessness with 
the ship gone? How could Jackson 


THE IRON THORN 


143 



do that to a creature at his mercy 
that he did not ever need to eat? 

Eat. 

“What about this lichen they eat? 
Can you synthesize that for . our 
shipmate?” 

“There is no need to synthesize,” 
the doctor said. “It's a perfectly 
normal Terrestial form.” 

“Oh. Then there’s no problem. 
Let’s bring him in. We’ll control 
him long enough for you and Susie m 
to do as much as you can for his 
brain and data file, and it’s solved.” 

“It is not. You’re already prov- 
ing a little knowledge is a dangerous 
thing. In the first place, I don’t 
know what you mean by control, 
but I certainly wouldn’t take on any 
hostile organisms of his size with 
an arm as fragile as yours is at 
present. And you don’t seem to have 
drawn the proper conclusions from 
his diet. I am amazed you were 
able to survive out there at all. I 
have no predisposants that could 
possibly do anything useful to his 
nucleic acids. You’e anthropomor- 
phizing. To all intents and purposes, 
there is less kinship between him 
and the human heritage than there 
is between you and me.” 

“That’s ridiculous!” Susiem cried. 
“He’s perfectly human — he can’t 
fly, can he?” 

“If you don’t want your mistakes 
brought up, don’t activate doctors.” 

“All right, you two, cut it out,” 
Jackson said. What the hell did the 
doctor mean he couldn't control Ah- 
muls? It was perfectly plain how he 
could control Ahmuls — he’d been 
told about it in his sophomore year. 
What he hadn’t been told was how 


to like it. But he’d been taught 
how to get along without that while 
going for his masters. It was amaz- 
ing the things he’d been taught. 
“Doctor — All right, you can’t pre- 
dispose him. Can you patch him up 
if he’s hurt?” 

“No problem,” the Medico re- 
plied. 

“Susiem, if we let him in, can 
you protect your components in that 
room?” 

“To an extent.” 

“Well, then, let’s get at it — I’m 
sick of this place. The sooner we 
get this done, the quicker we can 
move.” I wonder how he’ll like 
Ariwol. 

H e walked up the companionway 
to the airlock level. He put 
his face up close to the door. “Ah- 
muls! Ahmuls, can you hear me?” 
“You son of a bitch.” 

“Listen to me — if I open this 
door, what’ll you do?” 

“Kill you, you son of a bitch.” 
“Ahmuls, listen close. You may 
not believe this, but I can bust you 
up real good.” 

“Not if I kill you, you son of a 
bitch.” 

“Ahmuls, I’m telling you — they 
gave me a — ” what had they given 
him? They’d given him a weapon, 
and he had picked it up. 

By the time Susiem was launched, 
the art of unarmed combat on Earth 
had reached a point of development 
which made practice unnecessary 
and the karate-ka’s callouses super- 
fluous. The system had been refined 
to so simple a point that a mere ex- 
planation of what places to be 


144 


IF 



touched was sufficient. Any man 
with a decent memory for instruction 
and reasonable dexterity could suc- 
cessfully apply it to an equally pro- 
ficient man with slower reflexes — 
and to all uninitiates — with cun- 
ning rapidity and shocking accomp- 
lishment. Jackson s reflexes were not 
as quick as Ahmuls’s, but his mem- 
ory was as fast as Susiem’s feed to 
his brain, and in any case Ahmuls 
just had no idea — 

“Aw, hell,” Jackson said. “Susiem, 
open the door.” 

It was amazing how fast he was, 
bags of loose flesh and all, flap- 
ping and grunting, his feet slap- 
slapping, his pudgy hands extended 
from his forearms as if he were 
wearing ragged sleeves. 

Jackson extended his body, right 
forefinger first, and touched him as 
he had been told, in the fieldhouse 
amphitheater of the sunny Canter- 
bury Gothic campus. It was shock- 
ing how Ahmul’s feet flew out from 
under him, and he fell backward to 
the deck. Jackson reached down 
quickly, and touched the one ankle 
he could reach; Ahmuls cried out. 
He probably hadn’t often felt pain. 
Not once he’d gotten big enough. 

Jackson moved back out of the 
way: “Look, Ahmuls — you can’t 
get up to catch me now. Will you 
listen?” 

But Ahmuls could get up. People 
did walk on broken legs — they 
even ran on them, when they had to, 
if they were in shock. It was just 
a matter of how much actual physical 
incapacity was introduced into their 
physical structures. Until things real- 
ly disintegrated, they could just keep 

THE IRON THORN 


running. It happened on football 
fields and in parachute jump training 
all the time. The odd part about it 
ways it often made them run faster. 

Jackson wove around Ahmuls. 
His reflexes were slower, but the 
method was foolproof against charg- 
ing attacks provided the eye could 
register them at all. He touched 
Ahmuls on the ribs. After that, Ah- 
muls’s side was like a rawhide bag 
of blood. Goddamn it, don’t ooze 
on me! Jackson thought as he made 
Ahmuls brush by him again. Aw, 
you dumb animal! “Give up!” he 
yelled. 

Ahmuls charged him, grunting: 
“Leave me alone — leave me alone, 
will you!” 

J ackson touched both arms. He 
had to take the shock of Ahmuls 
hitting him, but he took it on Ah- 
muls’s bad side, and anyway, Ahmuls 
then had no arms to hug him with. 
He moved them right, but they bent 
in two places, and Jackson got out 
through them. 

“Get the doctor up here!” Jackson 
yelled. 

“Watch out for my components!” 
Susiem cried as Ahmuls blundered. 

“The hell with you and all your 
components!” Jackson yelled as he 
touched Ahmuls low in the back, 
feeling the flesh turn to porridge as 
the shock traveled from where he 
touched, and then he touched again 
in the same place, just to make sure; 
this time he felt the same thing in 
his fingertip you feel when you’re 
a kid and you nudge out a baby 
tooth. Ahmuls windmilled his floppy 
arms, but he had nothing to hold his 

145 



legs up any more, and he went down, 
fading in the middle and folding at 
tfie broken ankle, putting out his 
broken arms to catch him, landing on 
his broken side, and then his face. 
He lay slumped on his knees, arms 
out, his face squashed flat against 
the deck, and only one red eye peer- 
ing up at Jackson. 

“All right, all right,” he wept. The 
tears found hidden channels in his 
folded cheek. 

Jackson dropped to his knees on 
the deck beside him. “I tried to tell 
ya,” he said. 

“Yuh.” Ahmuls swung his neck as 
best he could, very fast, going for 
Jackson’s wrist with his teeth. Jack- 
son pushed his head down. “Cut it 
out, please cut it out.” 

“Yuh. Yuh, all right, all right, 
I’ve got nothing left.” His fingers 
crept toward Jackson’s ankle, drag- 
ging his arm, and Jackson put his 
knee on them. The doctor came roll- 
ing up. He stood there. 

“Well, goddamn it,” Jackson 
squalled, “what are you waiting for?” 
“I have no authorization.” 

“All right — pursuant to the 
emergency veterinary provisions, I 
declare this creature is a valuable, 
harmless, alien life form in distress. 
I order you to proceed with medical 
services as far as your knowledge 
and experience go!” 

The doctor’s sides unfolded. “Yes, 
sir. No problem.” 

Ahmuls had quit trying to move 
his fingers under Jackson’s knee. 
Under his face, the deck was wet. 
“What are you going to do? What 
are you going to do, all you soft 
things?” 


“No, no, it's all right, Ahmuls,” 
Jackson said. His hand on Ahmuls’s 
head was making soothing motions 
up where a Amsir would have its 
lace. “The doctor’ll fix you. You’ve 
got to listen, Ahmuls. Why the hell 
can’t you listen? I love you.” 

“Did you have to hit me?” 

The doctor gathered Ahmuls up in 
his arms. He was amazingly gentle. 
He lifted smoothly and tenderly, 
making Ahmuls comfortable in his 
arms. He was shockingly gentle. 

A maintenance machine had al- 
ready slipped from its wall recess. It 
was hovering around the three of 
them, jockeying to get to the deck 
where it was messed up. 

“Just wait your turn, Susiem,” 
Jackson said angrily, facing the 
maintenance machine as if it had 
eyes and ears. “You have no sense 
of decency, no sense at all.”

66/^<et me an audiovisual picture 
V-J of the outside,” he told 
Susiem, sitting in the piloting chair. 

Susiem swung a scope toward him. 
The speakers filled with the sounds 
of outside; the rustle of wings, the 
murmur of wind, the ping and 
crackle of large expanses of metal 
in the open weather. The Amsirs 
were flying patrol just past the door, 
beating back and forth, spears 
ready. There was a littering of 
broken spears on the ground below 
the airlock ladder. At the doorway 
of the Thorn, the Amsir Eld, and the 
instructing Amsir, and a crowd of 
more than six but less than twelve 
apprentices of some type were clus-

tered there, in postures that were not 
essentially useful. He could hear 
them discoursing; he motioned im- 
patiently toward the gain control and 
he could make out their words. They 
were disputatious and bereft. 

“And I tell you we must accept 
the possibility that we are the in- 
terlopers here!” one of them was 
saying. 

“Shut up! I can clearly recall a 
witnessed discourse in which it was 
impeccably postulated that if the 
Thing destroyed our kind on touch, 
how much more terrible must be the 
fate of any creature it would permit 
to enter its maw!” 

“Shut up yourself! I’ll try conclu- 
sions with you any time!” 

“Eld!” Jackson said, and the 
Thing growled to the Amsirs at the 
doorway. “Eld — stand clear!” 

“What?” The hard beak was up. 
The bright, dark eyes were search- 
ing where the doorway was on top 
of the ladder. 

“Eld, I have some facts for you.” 

The communicator went dead. 
The screen was blank, the speakers 
were silent. “You are not permitted 
to contaminate the experiment,” 
Susiem said. “You are exceeding 
your authority and directly contra- 
vening expedition regulations. You 
are not permitted to communicate 
facts to the experimental subjects. 
All facts required by the experiment- 
al subjects are predetermined, pro- 
grammed, and were long ago intro- 
duced to the system. Any repetition 
of this incident will result in your 
automatic and immediate dismissal 
from command. This incident will be 
logged and recorded at the earliest 


opportunity following reacquisition 
of contact with the project commun- 
ications network. You are repri- 
manded and are permitted to resume 
communication only on the basis 
that you make no further attempt at 
contamination.” 

The screen and the speakers came 
back to life. “Stand clear,” Jackson 
shouted to the Eld. He counted 
thirty seconds on the fascia clock. 
“Let’s go, Susiem,” he said, and 
with a bang, and a roar and a flash, 
they all went, taking the world’s 
hope with them. 

E arth was pastorally green, its 
hillocks crowned by elms, its in- 
frequent, low buildings starkly white. 
Earth was green, fair; heady with 
the wine of life; in a condition not 
often attained since the hills of 
Greece were first so limned by the 
deft pencillings of Walt Disney. 

XXI 

I t hadn’t seemed like such a par- 
ticularly long trip. He had spent 
large parts of it in the piloting couch. 
At first he’d yearned at the stars 
in their great glowing panoplies, be- 
mused to think that he finally un- 
derstood what they were, toying at 
his mind with thoughts of immensity, 
with notions of how vast it all was, 
how marvelous its creation, how un- 
fathomable its extent. Fantasy-grasps 
of mascrocosm and microcosm haunt- 
ed his understanding. All this great 
clockwork, all this explosion and de- 
cay, these cycles and epicycles of in- 
finitude distended his capillaries with 
shivers of delight at how vast a table 


THE IRON THORN 


147 



had been prepared before him. For 
a while he thought he understood 
the infinitely tiny complexities that 
hurtled round about themselves to 
form each millimicrocubit of im- 
mensity. 

And Susiem did much to sustain 
this feeling for him. She groaned 
and whined, thumping and jolting 
within herself all around him; his 
couch hummed to her trembling. 
Each start of ignition, each fit of 
clicking busyness seemed to reflect 
another spasm of gobbling at the 
miles between where he was and the 
nebulae on which his eyesight rested. 

But a couple of days went by and 
it occurred to him that the nebulae 
weren’t getting effectively closer. He 
had a clear intellectual understand- 
ing of how many miles per day were 
being clocked on Susiem’s instru- 
ments. He got the idea that he ought 
to calculate how many days of whin- 
ing, banging, and groaning from this 
tireless mechanism he’d have to en- 
dure before he got to the nearest 
nebula. It came to him that there 
was just so much of that a man could 
put up with. 

Susiem could put up with it for- 
ever of course. Only somebody like 
Susiem was liable to want, to. 

“How’s the doctor coming along 
with Ahmuls?” he asked her, think- 
ing a good way to put it was that he 
was lonely among a myriad of stars. 

“I’ll check .... He's reporting 
good progress. Considering healing 
had been accomplished and the pa- 
tient is resting. His manner is sub- 
dued.” 

“Yeah, well. He’s had a lot happen 
to him.” 


He had Susiem close the ablation 
shutters on the piloting windows 
again. And for a while he had her 
run tapes of Earth. He found that 
it was just as he remembered it — 
swarming with Man and his works, 
beautiful beyond belief, busy in its 
beauty, echoing with flashes of light 
and sound, a-shake with motion, 
singing of power to the morning and 
the evening wind. 

He created little moments of nai- 
vete for himself. He looked at the 
rivers tumbling down out of the 
mountains and rowelling across the 
plains while saying to himself I never 
knew there was that much water in 
the world; how green everything is, 
how full I He looked at the cities 
where the rivers forked, at the ship- 
ping complexes in the deltas where 
rivers and Ocean mingled, and he 
cried out to himself Thalassa ! Thai - 
ass a! He compared the flight of sup- 
ersonic aircraft with flappings of 
Amsirs and he pretended to see a 
portable rocket launcher in terms 
of a demigod’s throwing stick. He 
craned his neck at the cloudraking 
spires of the mighty cities. And he 
made the back of his mind wail: 
“Alas, Thorn!” 

Ah, horse apples, he said after 
very little of that, being a man with 
a Master’s, and had Susiem turn it 
off. 

What to do? Jackson had another 
meal — this time it was delicious, 
because he knew how to order. 
There was even wine. Wine was con- 
siderably better than beer. But it 
left him moody. 

He had Susiem play him some 
music. He read from her library, 


.148 


IF 



sticking mainly to entertainment; 
westerns, mostly, at first. Susiem’s 
library had a first chapter precis in- 
dex; by using it lackadasically and 
carelessly, he tripped over the Big 
Little Book version of John Carter 
of Mars and from there his taste 
spiralled outward. He had gotten 
as far as G-8’s struggle against the 
Kaiser’s land-crawling aircraft car- 
rier when Susiem passed him the 
word the Ahmuls was ready to be 
talked to. 

^iX^ou feeling all right?” 

I “He feels fine,” the doctor 
said. “All his structural damage is 
repaired and healed. It was a massive 
job, but what with all the things I 
know how to do — and three day’s 
sleep — he’s fine.” 

Ahmuls was sitting propped half- 
way up in a Sick Bay bunk, lean- 
ing back into a corner. There were 
shadows across his face. But he had 
his hands up framing his cheeks, and 
you could see lights glinting on his 
open eyes. 

“How do you feel about all that?” 
Jackson said. 

“Feel rotten,” Ahmuls mumbled. 
“That doctor machine says we’re go- 
ing someplace. Where to?” 

“Yeah, well. That’s what I’m here 
to explain. You all done trying to 
kill me?” 

“Can’t kill you, you son of a 
bitch.” 

“Aw, come on, Ahmuls. I’m glad 
you’re all done trying to kill me, 
but I wish you wouldn’t call me 
names. Look, it’s not like it was, 
all our lives. It’s all different.” 

“I’m no different.” 


“Well, I am!” 

“You say.” 

“Well, will you listen?” 

“Gotta listen. You can kill me.” 
Jackson sighed and gestured to- 
ward a chair-cubby. The chair came 
promptly out of the wall. He sat 
down on it with the feeling that he 
might be here a long time. “All right. 
So listen. Where we were before 
was a place called Mars.” 

“Amsirs,” Ahmuls repeated stud- 
iously. 

“Okay, now there were these two 
places where people lived. My place 
and yours.” 

“One place, where Amsirs lived. 
You’re not people. Maybe I’m not 
people. But I’m not as soft as you 
are.” 

“There were these two places 
where people lived. Amsirs and 
humans. But they came from the 
same place. The reason Amsirs look- 
ed different from people is because 
somebody wanted to see if people 
could be changed.” 

“Humans look different from Am- 
sirs. Amsirs are people.” 

And so on. Jackson spent the bet- 
ter part of the rest of the trip try- 
ing to explain genetics to Ahmuls. 
But Ahmuls had the idea he already 
knew as much as anybody could 
teach him. He sat on his bunk most 
of the time, eating little brick- 
shaped packets of lichen as they 
were issued to him by Susiem ac- 
cording to the doctor’s menu, and 
every so often either he or Jackson 
had to stop to go to the Head. But 
he listened because Jackson could 
kill him if he didn’t. This seemed 
to be an attitude Ahmuls had learned 


THE IRON THORN 


149 




long before he had Jackson for a 
tutor. 

Finally, Susiem told Jackson they 
were only hours away from docking 
at Columbus, Ohio, and that he had 
better start getting presentable. 

“All right,” Jackson said. “Ah 
muls, you hear that? Now pretty 
soon you’re going to get a chance 
to really see something. You’re go- 
ing to see more people and more 
machinery than either you or me 
ever had any idea of. You’re going 
to see the place we all come from. 
Your folks, my folks, the Amsirs* 
folks. We all come from the same 
place. You’re going to get to see 
people living in houses stacked up 
two hundred houses tall. You’re go- 
ing to get to see places that make 
the whole place the Amsirs live in 
look no bigger than the way one 
Amsir house looks compared to the 
whole bunch of them. You’re go- 
ing to see things zipping across the 
sky three, five hundred times quick- 
er’n a Amsir can fly falling straight 
down.” 

Ahmuls said: “How many dozen 
is that?” 

“Oh, dear God. All right. Don’t 
learn. I’m trying to tell you you’re 
going to see things that you won’t 
know how to act about. You’re go- 
ing to have more chances to be hap- 
py than you’ve ever thought of.” 
Well, it seemed reasonable. Wide as 
the world was, and as complex as he 
he knew it could be, there had to 
be something in it for the poor 
freak. 

For the poor, dangerous freak. 
“And there’s going to be lots of 
chances for you to be stupid, and 


150 


IF 



for you to get hurt. So I’m telling 
you one last time — you don’t want 
to learn, all right, you don’t have 
to learn. But, by God, at least know 
you’re stupid. Don’t go pushing into 
things. Watch and wait. Walk soft. 
Maybe after a while you'll realize 
I’m giving you the straight goods. 
Any time you’re ready, you just tell 
me and I’ll do my best to tell you the 
straight of it again.” 

“I’m straight now,” Ahmuls said, 
twiddling the flesh that grew on his 
arms where his wings should have 
been. 

J ust before they hit atmosphere, 
Jackson came down to Sick Bay 
to be with Ahmuls, knowing how the 
noise and the changes of accelera- 
tion would upset him. Jackson was 
wearing his captain’s pale blue cov- 
erall with the Associated Universi- 
ties shoulder patch. 

“What you got on you?” Ahmuls 
asked. 

“This is clothes,” Jackson said. “I 
had Susiem make some for you, too. 
Here.” He passed over the specially 
cut coveralls. “You got to put these 
on too. It’s like a blanket. It keeps 
the cold and the sun off you.” 

“I ain’t never seen you wear 
clothes before.” 

“Well, I didn’t. But I know better 
now.” 

“I don’t know any better.” 

“Look, you want them all to think 
you’re a freak?” 

“What, those soft people you said 
all look like you?” 

“Come on, Ahmuls, put the 
clothes on.” 

“You going to kill me if I don’t 


put the clothes on? I ain’t cold and 
there ain’t no sun on me. Don’t 
they >know enough to go into those 
houses when they have to?” He 
dropped the coveralls on the floor. 

Jackson shook his head. “All 
right, Ahmuls. All right.” He stretch- 
ed out on another bunk. His skin 
was already chafed in a couple of 
places; it was having a hard time 
getting used to the whole idea of be- 
ing wrapped up all around the legs 
and crotch. But he was very badly 
embarrassed at the thought of step- 
ping out in front of a spaceport full 
of people with a naked freak at his 
side. It was, when he stopped to 
think of it, the first time in his life 
that he'd ever been embarrassed at 
first hand. 

It was the damnedest feeling. It 
occupied considerable of his atten- 
tion while the ship was coming down 
in her final approach. Ahmuls 
whimpered and lurched around on 
the bunk all through the process. 
What’s going to become of him? 
Jackson thought. 

But Earth was pastorally green, 
its hillocks crowned by elms, its in- 
frequent, low buildings starkly white. 

“This is the site of the Associated 
Universities docking facilities,” Su- 
siem said as Jackson stared out 
through the open airlock hatch like 
a kid who has just watched a dart 
hit a target broadside on and bounce 
off. “There have been social changes 
on Earth since my last communica- 
tion from the project. I have just 
been assured you will be brought up 
to date on these changes by another 
source. You and your companion 
are instructed to debark from this 


THE IRON THORN 


151 



vessel immediately, since it is no 
longer classified habitable. Atten- 
tion, all hands! Captain going 
ashore!” 

“Good-by fellows,” the doctor 
said as Jackson and Ahmuls slipped 
down the ladder. “Don’t worry, Ah- 
muls — your menu’s on file with 
Central. They tell me all you have 
to do when you get hungry is say so 
out loud!” 

“Always did,” Ahmuls said. 

J ackson looked at Susiem’s height. 

She was beginning to ring. He 
noticed a swarm of bright, dancing 
insects? — whirling around the very 
tip of her prow. They were bullet- 
ing in from over the top of the 
nearest hillock, in a stream that 
thickened rapidly, divided to pass 
around the trunks and through the 
branches of the elms and clustered 
more and more passionately around 
the tip. 

The ringing sound increased in 
volume, and he saw that Susiem was 
blunted. Her prow was gone. As he 
watched, the tightly spiralling in- 
sects ate another shaving of metal 
from her plates, and then came 
round again, cutting off a little bit 
more with each pass, passing very 
quickly. It was like a Looneytoon 
of termites destroying Elmer Fudd’s 
house. 

Some of the insects broke away 
from Susiem, and darted down to- 
ward the ground. One nearby seemed 
to be performing a typical action; it 


had a little chunk of astronautics- 
grade steel in its mouth, and it was 
spinning like an augur. It bored 
down, Jackson judged by its speed, 
two or three feet into the ground, 
then backed out empty-jowed, and 
immediately streaked back to snip 
off more. 

Larger bugs came down out of 
the sky, burrowing into the exposed 
’tween-deck spaces, and the com- 
ponent arrays behind the striped-out 
plating. They buzzed away again, 
trailing some few components in 
their grappling appendages, casting 
off most of the others, which fell in 
a swath beyond the diminishing 
Susiem with sharp thuds on the 
thick, clipper green grass and deli- 
cate wildflowers. Ground-moving in- 
sects and other metal creatures of 
that kind were waiting to pick them 
over, chop them up into chunks, 
plant some and gulp down others as 
if they had digestions. 

“Hey!” Jackson yelled, trying to 
get through to Susiem before there 
was no one left on Earth to tell him 
what was happening. But it was way 
too late for that. She and the doctor 
and the food-serving robot and the 
maintenance robot and everything 
about her — except for Jackson’s 
coveralls — were dead and useless. 
Well, no, not useless. A lot of val- 
uable minerals had just been put 
back into Earth’s soil. 

Ahmuls was looking around. “I 
see some people coming,” he said. 
“They ain’t got no clothes on.” 


TO BE CONCLUDED

IF 



IF ® Short Story 


Latter-Day 
Daniel by betsv curtis 


Letting a lion eat your arm off 
isn't the easiest way to make a 
living — but it beats starvation I 


B eale did not just stand there and 
watch the lion chew off his left 
arm. He helped! 

Occasionally he yelled loud enough 
to be heard over the growling snarls 
of the busy beast. His right arm 
clutched one of the iron bars of the 
cage, and his right foot was hooked 
around another so that he could pull 
one way while Nero pulled the oth- 
er. Nero wasn’t working very hard 
at it. Although his teeth were firmly 
sunk into Beale’s forearm, he hadn’t 
taken the trouble to gnaw the joint, 
and the ligaments were holding. 
Beale felt as if he were about to be 
jerked into pieces, and he didn’t 
dare hook his left foot on the bars 
too, for fear Nero would rear up 
and claw at the shoulder and he, 


Beale, would have nothing to kick 
him back with. 

Beale leaned toward the yanking 
lion, hoping that the beast would let 
go and take hold around the elbow 
somewhere and grind those tendons 
loose. Somebody in the crowd let 
out a snicker. “Fake!” he heard the 
damning yell. “Robot!” somebody 
else yelled, and a bag of peanut 
shucks hit the back of his bare torso. 
Beale would have liked to yell back, 
“The Hell I am,” as the cold blasts 
of March wind brought out the 
bumps along his spine. But the or- 
ders read, “no back talk with the zoo 
patrons.” And this was a good 
enough job as jobs went. 

He had a momentary flash of the 
newspaper ad. “One-armed man 


153 


needed for easy job involving public 
appearances.” 

N ero loosened bis grip and started 
working toward the elbow. 
Beale held his leaning position, work- 
ing his arm down while trying to 
act as if he were trying to get it out 
of those slavering jaws by clever 
maneuvering. Just then Nero hit the 
artery, and blood gushed out over 
his face and onto the scrubbed stone 
floor of the cage. 

“Oooooh!” came from the throats 
of the crowd. That was always a sure 
hit. Beale tightened the muscles in 
his neck and shoulders and pulled. 
He hoped his audience would be im- 
pressed by his heroic stature and 
fortitude. And that they still hadn’t 
noticed how much stronger, longer, 
and meatier the left arm was than 
the right. 

Nero opened the gooey great jaws 
for a second and then snap! crunch! 
— they closed on the elbow. Good. 
Hie forearm came loose with only 
a few shreds of tendon left holding 
it to the upper arm. Beale jerked 
and broke them and leaned back, 
panting and pretending to sob against 
the icy bars while Nero sank to the 
floor to worry the severed member, 
growling and snorting. 

The crowd was momentarily si- 
lent. 

Beale took the opportunity to 
sweep it with a single agonized 
glance. After all, he couldn’t just 
bow and walk out now. He still had 
to pretend to drag himself painfully 
through the low opening of Nero’s 
den. The show must go on — he’d 
read that somewhere. 


Yes, there on the outskirts of the 
crowd was the telltale fluorescent 
green uniform of an officer of the 
Animal Protective League. The boss 
was right. You could never tell when 
they’d be there, but it was always 
better to be on the right side of 
the law. And in the zoo business the 
A.P.L. was the law. Or practically. 

Just at that moment, half a sand- 
wich flew through the bars and on- 
to the gory floor of the cage. Beale 
leaned over it deliberately, picked it 
up and gestured with the stump of 
his left arm at the sign on the 
front of the cage which he knew 
read “Nero, the Only African Lion 
in Captivity in This Country. DO 
NOT FEED THE ANIMALS.” 

The crowd rocked with laughter. 
Shouts of “what about you?” and 
“Yon did!” were clearly audible. 
Beale bowed. A touch of comedy 
was always good. 

Then he dropped the sandwich 
into the trench on the outside of 
the bars and, clutching the still 
dripping left stump, went around 
the feeding lion and crawled into 
the low, dark den opening. A slow 
sigh of regret that it was all over 
arose from the mob in front of the 
cage; and Beale could hear them 
shuffling their feet before they wan- 
dered away to other exhibits. 

A cross the dark den he entered 
the door of his dressing room, 
where he stripped off the remaining 
section of synthiflesh above the el- 
bow, tugging gently at the adhesive 
synthiskin where it was semi grafted 
to his own. Dropping the arm rem- 
nants into the incinerator slot, he 


154 


IP 



got out of his shorts and metal-toed 
shoes, showered very hot and soapy, 
rinsed and then dried in the blast of 
hot air from a floor fan. 

He put on his neat, dark gray 
shirt, his dark blue street shorts and 
stormjac, slipped into the knee boots 
of softly polished gray leatherene, 
ran a comb through his crisp light 
hair; and, except for the left arm of 
the stormjac which he tucked into 
the side pocket, he looked just like 
any citizen getting a late start for a 
respectable desk job. Bob Beale, in- 
surance executive ... Bob Beale, 
bank teller. 

Opening the outside door of his 
dressing room, he looked warily up 
and down the alley between the backs 
of the rows of animal cages. Zoo 
goers might not thrill to his quick 
change from victim to prosperous 
and comfortable citizen. 

“Mister . uh . .” Her green 
uniform fluoresced gaily in the sliver 
of sunlight which hit the pavement 
in front of his door. 

“Oh,” he said shortly, “Miss 
A.P.L. herself.” 

“That’s right,” she admitted. “I’d 
like to talk to you, Mr. Mr. .” 

“Beale.” No words to spare for 
the likes of her — though on closer 
look it wasn’t a bad likes. 

“Mr. Beale. About the lion. You 
are the lion man aren’t you? Can 
I come in?” she asked, her little 
black curls bobbing beneath the 
flat, shining green cap. 

“There’s nothing to talk about. 
This show is just the way you peo- 
ple ordered it. We’re observing every 
regulation in the book. What do you 
want me to do . brush Nero’s 


teeth before and after?” His tone 
was sour. 

“No, it’s not that,” she said earn- 
estly, as if it were quite possible that 
she could order him to brush those 
monstrous dark yellow fangs. 

“Well,” he said slowly, “I guess 
I have time for a cup of coffee be- 
fore I go to the lab to get my next 
arm put on. It takes a day to set, 
you know.” He stepped down to the 
pavement from the doorway. “We 
couldn’t talk in there . nothing 
there but the shower and my dirty 
clothes. We can get coffee at Alec’s, 
and you can bend my ear, I sup- 
pose.” 

S he smiled up at him. “Is it pri- 
_ vate? Does Alec’s have booths 
or something? This is important, and 
we mustn’t let anybody hear us. 
That’s why I suggested your room.” 
“Yes, there are booths at Alec’s.” 
He looked at her curiously. “But I 
can’t imagine anything about Nero 
that the world couldn’t hear. He’s 
pretty noisy himself, you know.” 
They strolled down the alley, and 
from a break between the backs of 
the cages the lion’s slupping and 
masticating could be plainly heard. 

“It’s a plot,” she said earnestly 
in a low voice, “a plot to kidnap 
Nero.” 

“Well, I’ll be a rhino’s Aunt Milly! 
I suppose some other poor devil is 
being matrized for fake arms for the 
critter to gnaw off.” 

“Ssssh! We simply mustn’t discuss 
it here,” she warned him and laid 
her hand on his good arm, then 
looked down at it. “Doesn’t it hurt, 
sometimes, when Nero takes as long 


LATTER-DAY DANIEL 


155 



as he did today and shakes you all 
around like that?” 

“Sure, but it makes a good show, 
though, and .who are you to care if 
it hurts a mere man? I’m no animal 
to be treated with tender care.” 

“I just wondered. Was any of that 
blood yours?” She shuddered in the 
cold wind which swept around the 
end of the row of cages as they pre- 
pared to enter the main concourse. 

“No. There’s reservoir of the stuff 
(human, of course, from a blood 
bank) just below the shoulder. And 
there aren’t any nerves in the arm, 
you know, just some synthitendons 
so I can make it move. Pretty realis- 
tic, though, isn’t it?” he asked proud- 

iy- 

“I think,” she said decidedly, 
“that it’s entirely too realistic. It’s 
effect on the audience is utterly 
brutalizing. If there were one thing 
I could do about it, I’d have it 
stopped entirely.” 

“Come, now. You must be in the 
wrong job if you’re more concerned 
about people than animals. Besides, 
you don’t understand,” they were 
crossing the concourse toward the 
neons of Alec’s, “people need that 
kind of thing, really need it. You 
folks have done away with horse- 
racing, bullfighting, foxhunting and 
almost all other kinds of hunting, 
game fishing; and now you’d like to 
make vegetarians of the world. It’s 
against the law now to display any 
kind of dead red meat, and poor 
Nero would have to eat only his pan 
of pulverized dog food if I didn’t 
turn up with a good juicy arm every 
couple of days. And the mob would 
turn to carving one another up just 


to get a little excitement. This is good 
for them.” 

“I never thought of it just that 
way,” she said, and then primly, 
“You’re quite a preacher.” 

H e colored. “I didn’t mean to 
make a speech; but I wouldn’t 
want to find myself in a lonely place 
with some of that gang that was 
watching me today if they didn’t have 
their chance to come to the zoo.” 
“Yes, and watching you just wets 
their appetites!” 

“It does not either! It satisfies it. 
Some of them come practically every 
day I perform. But let’s not fight. 
Here’s Alec’s. What’ll you have?” 
“I don’t want anything. I just want 
to tell you what I have to tell and 
be on my way. I still have four ma- 
jor inspections today, including a 
dog pound.” 

“I didn’t know there were any 
dogs left to catch. You have to have 
more references, financial and moral, 
than if you were going to adopt a 
baby just to rent a dog. Two coffees, 
Alec,” he said, passing the counter 
and leading the way back to the rear 
of the dark eatery. He stopped at 
the last booth and let her go by to 
the back seat. 

She slipped into the seat and sat 
very straight, her hands in her lap. 

“Now what’s this about a plot on 
old Nero?” he wanted to know. “No- 
body can hear us here ... all the 
booths are empty. The seals are get- 
ting the crowd along with their daily 
ration of synthifish.” 

“It’s the MGM zoo in California,” 
she whispered. “They haven’t had a 
lion for ten years, though they did 


156 


IF 



have a lioness till last October.” She 
leaned closer across the table. “Of 
course we won’t let them import 
another one; and they’ve been jealous 
of Brooklyn and had their eye on 
Nero ever since. They’ve hired a 
gang of thugs to get Nero and bleach 
him a little and synthesize some new 
fur over that scar on his flank and 
truck him out to them. We got wind 
of it because the gang is posing as 
A.P.L. officials, and they’re going 
to pretend it’s a raid on the zoo for 
having some illegal predators or 
something. One of the leaders really 
was a minor official once, but he 
was fired for selling kittens several 
years ago; and we’ve been keeping a 
close watch on him. That’s how we 
found out about the plot.” 

“Well, you don’t have to worry, 
then. There isn’t an illegal predator 
on the place; and the gang would 
have to be magicians to get an ani- 
mal transport truck onto the grounds 
without getting tangled in so much 
red tape that they’d be sorry they 
ever had the idea.” He syrupped his 
coffee and stirred vigorously. 

“That’s just it.” She sat back. “We 
make the red tape, and in our uni- 
forms they could get Nero out before 
you could say ‘dachshund.’ ” 

Beale sighed. “Well, he’d be treat- 
ed okay even at MGM; and I can’t 
say I’d be sorry to see this job come 
to an end for a while. I can always 
go back to selling newspapers.” He 
shrugged his shoulders and took a 
drink on his coffee mock-resignedly. 

“No, no, I don’t want ... we don’t 
want . well the local officials 
think that the Brooklyn Zoo should 
keep Nero as long as he lives. The 


zoo has really done very well in fol- 
lowing all our regulations. I mean, if 
you tell your boss, he can have 
guards posted or something. You 
aren’t going to let a gang of crooks 
have Nero, are you?” she asked in- 
credulously. “You . you coward!” 

4 4 'X Tow wait a minute , Miss,” 
Beale protested. “You don’t 
mean you want me to take this seri- 
ously? Why if another zoo stole 
Nero, how could they display him 
without having to account for his 
being there? The boss would just 
bring action and have Nero shipped 
back here by jet in time for the 
next arm-chew.” 

“They’d maintain that they bought 
him legally and that the transaction 
was cleared with us and that our peo- 
ple brought him to them ... if you 
could prove that it was really the 
same lion. At the same time, 'they’d 
institute a big investigation through 
the real A.P.L. to find out by what 
criminal negligence you’d allowed 
your own lion to die or disappear. 
Not only would it be a nasty mess 
all round, but who knows what ef- 
fect it might have on Nero? Psy- 
chologically, I mean . the trip 
and having to get used to a new 
trainer and a different climate and 
all. It would be simple cruelty, but 
very hard to prove,” she pleaded. 

“Well,” Beale reconsidered, “I 
suppose we could have guards, but 
the boss hates to hire an extra man 
without pretty good reason. And I

menagerie if he insisted. At any 
rate. I’ll talk to him about it. I’ll 
have to tell him who told me, 
though. What did you say your name 
was?” 

“I didn’t say . but it’s Whipple, 
Delia Whipple. I hope it won’t have 
to go any further than your boss, 
though, because the Animal Protec- 
tive League doesn’t want its espion- 
age system revealed in detail. And 
I’m fairly important irr it.” 

“Okay, Delia,” Beale grined. “And 
if you see anybody looking at you 
suspiciously, you just get in touch 
with me, and we’ll have a date so 
their spies will think your being with 
me is on the up and up.” 

“Oh, I couldn’t!” She looked ag- 
hast at the suggestion. “Not date an 
animal man! I’d be fired ... or 
something!” The idea seemed to 
arouse her much more than even the 
plot to steal Nero had. 

“Oh! You’ll go just so far to save 
Nero but no further, huh? Dinner 
and a show with a smelly animal 
man is too far?” His voice was rich 
with scorn. “I might chew off your 
arm in an unguarded moment?” 

“Oh you don’t understand,” she 
cried, her face white. “Our organiza- 
tion has no legal recourse in cases 
of disloyalty, so our security mea- 
sures must be terribly strict. My 
mother and two of my uncles work 
for A.P.L., and if an investigation 
showed that I consorted with a known 
animal man, they’d get fired, too, for 
consorting with me before I even 
knew you. It’s that stringent. I just 
couldn’t.” 

“Consorting, huh. Interesting 
word,” he sneered. 


“You pick a better,” she retorted. 

“Frankly, I think your whole fam- 
ily would be better off working for 
some free and open outfit like . 
well ... a slaughterhouse. What do 
you get out of it anyway besides a 
salary? Permission to keep a Peki- 
nese?” 

“Oh no,” she objected indignantly. 
“We could never qualify to keep a 
pet. We all have to work, and there’s 
nobody home daytimes to look after 
a pet.” 

“You win.” He shook his head and 
grinned at her incredulously. “I 
guess I just can’t understand. I’ll go 
and get my next arm plastered on 
so it can get its full forty-seven hours 
to set; and then I’ll go see the boss 
and tell him what you’ve told me.” 
He moved to the edge of the seat. 

“Mr. Beale . .” she hesitated. 

“Yeah?” 

“You’ll probably think I’m terribly 
snoopy, but why don’t you get a 
real arm of your own with nerves 
and all instead of having poor imita- 
tions chewed off every two days?” 

“Couldn’t afford it. I’m saving 
up,” he told her gruffly. He rose 
and looked down at her and added, 
“I guess you’d better wait a minute 
or two so that we aren’t seen leaving 
together. Somebody might think we 
were consorting.” 

“Thanks,” she said graciously. 
“You won’t regret it.” 

“Think not?” he asked and head- 
ed for the register where he dropped 
a couple of zoo tokens and glanced 
out the door at the same time at the 
crowd shoving past the restaurant 
on its way to the monkey house 
where the diapered chimp babies

IF 



would be receiving their bottles from 
the prim, white-clad nurses, behind 
one-way glass. 

S uddenly he was startled to close 
attention. Four burly men in 
shining green uniforms were shoul- 
dering their way against the tide of 
the mob — in the direction of the 
lion house. 

“Delia!” Bob Beale’s voice was 
urgent. “Miss Whipple . quick!” 
She appeared at his side. “What 
is it?” 

“Are those your boys?” He point- 
ed after the vanishing husky backs. 

“I can’t be sure from the back, 
but I think so.” She raced to the 
door, and Beale followed close be- 
hind. 

Once in the midst of the mob, 
they were carried backward for 
several feet and completely separated 
before they could work to one side 
and out of the thickest of the press. 

As soon as Beale got free of the 
surging throng, he raced for the alley 
mouth behind the predator’s cages, 
to find the four men in green only 
a few yards ahead of him, standing 
truculently before the door beyond 
Beale’s own — the door to the ser- 
vice room for the lion’s cage. 

Bob caught himself up short and 
sauntered nonchalantly up to the 
group. “Looking for someone, gentle- 
men?” 

One of the men turned, a pasty- 
faced fellow made even more sallow 
by the reflected green glow on chin 
and jowls. 

‘‘No,” he informed Beale curtly. 
One of the others raised a fist. 
“Want me to tell him, eh boss?” 


“I’ll tell him,” the other motioned 
him back. “We’re the vet’s men here 
to remove an animal for inspection 
for suspected damage. What’s it to 
you?” 

Beale turned at a sound and saw 
a big, fluorescent green truck nosing 
cautiously up the alley behind 'him. 
He turned back to see one of the 
men opening the lion service door 
with a key. 

“Hey!” he shouted, “You can’t go 
in there!” 

“Who says we can’t, buster, you?” 
The man who had raised his fist 
came forward suddenly and slapped 
Bob across the face. “None of your 
back-chat to the A.P.L., or we’ll have 
you reported.” 

Beale shook his head to clear it. 
“Excuse me,” he said deferentially. 

The man stepped back. “That’s 
better,” he said. 

The pasty-faced man stepped be- 
tween them. “Excuse Judd, here,” 
he said apologetically. “Judd, you 
shouldn’ta done that. He’s a one- 
armed man ... he couldn’ta fought 
back.” 

“So much the better for me,” Judd 
laughed. 

fp'he truck was almost up to them; 

and the four men hurried 
through the lion door to avoid it. 
Bob opened his shower-room door 
quickly with his key and, once in- 
side, locked it behind him. Just as 
it was shutting, he heard a shrill 
feminine cry from behind the truck, 
but he had no time to investigate. 

He unlocked the inner door leading 
to Nero’s den, slipped through. He 
could hear the men’s voices in the 


LATTER-DAY DANIEL 


159 



service room on the other side of a 
thin partition arguing about who 
was to go on in and bring Nero out. 
With sureness born $f long experi- 
ence, Bob crossed the dark den and 
looked out into the main cage. Nero 
was still working over the arm bone. 
Bob crawled through the den mouth 
and stood up in the cage. 

“Here, Nero; here, pussy,” he 
called to the big, sleek beast. 

Nero raised his head and looked 
over at the den mouth, then went 
back to grinding away at the ex- 
posed ulna. 

“All right, then,” Beale muttered 
to himself. Looking out between the 
bars, he was relieved to see that no 
one was looking into the cage — 
that in fact there was no one even 
near the cage. He went forward to 
the bars and gave the jungle yell 
which was the signal to which he 
had trained Nero to respond by 
charging at him. 

Nero got up sluggishly, looked at 
Beale inquiringly as if to say, “An- 
other meal so soon? Good!” His 
tail waved from side to side. 

“You’ll have to catch me, though,” 
Beale said to him, grinning, and 
walked around the wall of the cage 
toward the den mouth. Nero walked 
after him slowly. Bob got down in 
his hands and knees and crawled 
into the den. “Come on, Nero,” he 
called back. 

As he started to stand up, he col- 
lided with a heavy figure, which he 
realized was human. “What th’?” 

“One side, buster!” It was Judd, 
the man who had hit him outside. 

“Okay,” Beale said obligingly and 
stepped to the left. 


T he man took another step toward 
the light of the den mouth and 
then stopped. “Gawd!” he yelled as 
the lion trotted through, blocking 
the light completely. He held out his 
left arm straight to ward off the 
trotting beast, and Nero obligingly 
jumped for the arm at the familiar 
signal. 

Beale’s eyes had adjusted quickly 
to the darkness, and he saw Nero’s 
spring. “Down, Nero!” he com- 
manded; but the lion was too well 
trained, and his jaws closed on the 
muscle of Judd’s arm with a crunch. 

Judd’s gargling scream echoed 
hideously in the enclosed den. 

Beale kicked out at the lion’s hind- 
paw and at the extended haunch be- 
fore him. Nero dropped back to the 
floor with a “graaaow” of pained 
surprise and turned to look at Beale 
inquiringly. His tail began to switch 
again, and he opened his tremendous 
jaws hopefully. 

Beale pulled his left sleeve out of 
its pocket and waved it with the 
stump of his upper arm at Nero. 
Nero took a couple of steps toward 
him. All this time, Judd had con- 
tinued to scream, but now the ulula- 
tions subsided to an agonized whim- 
per. Beale walked backward toward 
his door at the rear of the den, and 
Nero followed him at an even pace. 
Beale could hear the commotion on 
the other side of the service door. 
Somebody wanted to look in and see 
what had happened to Judd, and 
somebody else would be damned if 
he’d let anybody open the door and 
let that damned lion loose on them. 
Beale opened the door to his shower 
room, and the lion followed him in

quietly and stood suspiciously in the 
middle of the small space while 
Beale locked the door into the den. 

Now that he and the lion were 
safely and cosily locked into the 
white-tiled cubicle about eight by 
eight, he drew a long breath and 
tried to decide what to do next. 
“Down Nero! Sit, boy,” he told the 
bulky brute, which Nero, after a 
suspicious sniff of his antiseptic sur- 
roundings, obediently did. That was 
the first step, certainly. 

A hurried pounding on the outer 
door began. “Beale! Bob Beale!” he 
recognized the voice of Harris, one 
of the zoo guards. “You all right? 
Bob? Hey Bob!” 

“I’m all right, Tony,” Beale called 
through the door, “but I’ve got Nero 
in here with me, and there are four 
thugs in the service room next door 
who were trying to get away with 
him. Send somebody for the boss 
and a bunch of the boys. You see 
they don’t get away . that’s their 
truck in the alley.” 

He heard Harris shout away from 
the door and instantly after heard 
renewed commotion in the next 
room. “We gotta get outa here!” 
“He’s got the lion in there.” “Some- 
body go in and get Judd!” “You 
get him, then!” “Not me, I’m getting 
outa here!” 

sphere was a scrabbling noise from 
the next room, the rasp of the 
outer door being opened . then 
the sound of a fight from the 
alley . thuds, grunts, shouts, the 
sound of the gnashing of the truck’s 
gears and the rumble of its en- 
gine . then as the noise seemed to 

LATTER-DAY DANIEL 


recede up the alley, Judd’s voice 
could be heard howling, “Get me 
outa here! Help! Help! Get me out!” 

Nero’s tail curled up at the end 
and switched from side to side. 
“Steady, boy,” Beale told him and 
moved to stand beside him and 
stroked his mane. “I know he sounds 
delicious, but you’ve had yours for 
today.” 

Footsteps moved in the next room. 
Bob assumed that the door to the 
den was being opened, for he heard 
a woman’s voice say, “Where are 
you? I can’t see anything.” 

“Over here.” Judd’s voice died 
away through a whimper. 

“There. Put your arm around my 
neck. Can you stand up?” Her tones 
came clearly through the door. 
“Now, up!” He could hear them 
moving uncertainly toward the door, 
then through it. “UNCLE JUDD!” 
he heard her shout. “Uncle Judd! 
What are you doing here?” 

A sobbing whimper was the only 
reply. 

“Well, let me look at you.” A 
pause. “That arm’s pretty bad, but 
the rest of you doesn’t seem to be 
touched. I’ll help you to a doctor.” 

A grumble. 

“What?” 

“Gotta get out of here before 
they catch me.” 

“You’ve got to get to a doctor at 
once,” she objected. 

“Lemme go. I’ll get to a doctor. 
Gimme your coat. I’ll put it over 
my arm, and nobody will notice 
it.” Judd seemed to be regaining com- 
petency but fast. 

“No, Uncle Judd . hey . 
ouch!” 

161 



“Gimme that coat, I said!” 

“Oh, all right.” Another pause. 
“Here.” 

The door slammed. Then Beale 
heard a shout. “Got him. That 
makes all four!” Beale could hear 
tramping of several sets of feet up 
the alley. 

The door opened and shut again. 
Then there was knocking on his own 
door once more. “Mr. Beale?” 

“What is it?” 

“Are you really in there with the 
lion?” 

“Sure.” 

“What are you going to do now?” 

“Are they all gone outside?” 

“Yes.” 

“Well, sweetheart, you go back 
in and lock the door from the ser- 
vice room to the den, and I’ll put 
Nero back in the cage.” 

“All right.” He could hear her re- 
enter and do as he’d told her. Then 
he took Nero by the mane and 
turned his head around toward the 
door to the den. 

“Up, Nero.” The lion stood up 
and turned obediently as Beale 
forced his head around. Beale led 
him the two steps to the door, un- 
locked it, stood aside, gave Nero a 
mild kick in the rump. “In there, 
boy.” And in the lion went, to be 
locked securely back in his own safe 
quarters. 

Beale relaxed, and his hand went, 
routinely, abstractedly, to the show- 
er button; and he caught himself 
just in time to avoid a thorough 
soaking. 

“Mr. Beale . .” She was outside 
again. 

He went to the outer door and 


opened it to find her looking up at 
him. 

“Hi!” he greeted her. “A good 
day’s work. Thanks for the tip. Now 
you better scoot along before they 
catch you, too.” He gestured down 
the alley with the left arm stump 
and the coat sleeve swung free. 

As he stuffed the sleeve awkward- 
ly into the pocket, she said, “Catch 
me?” 

‘Talking . consorting . with 
me.” 

“Oh, that.” She laughed relieved- 
ly. “I can consort with anybody 
now. That “thug” was my mother’s 
brother, Judd. I’ve been consorting 
with my mother for years, you know, 
so I’m a permanent security risk. 
The Animal Protective League is 
done with me as soon as they find 
out. I’m unemployed as of this min- 
ute.” She laughed even more mer- 
rily; and Bob Beale was surprised 
to find how infectious freedom seem- 
ed to make her laughter. He grinned. 

“When I get my other arm on, 
honey,” he told her, “we can start 
consorting without wasting a min- 
ute. I wouldn’t want you to feel too 
unemployed.” 

I t was a mere two days later; and 
the lion was tugging him toward 
the front of the cage, teeth firmly 
sunk into the elbow joint. Beale’s 
eyes could search the crowd for the 
crisp black ringlets under the peaked 
white cap of a popcorn vendor. She 
was yelling with them for all she was 
worth. 

So Beale did not just stand there 
and watch the lion chew off his 
left arm. He helped. END
