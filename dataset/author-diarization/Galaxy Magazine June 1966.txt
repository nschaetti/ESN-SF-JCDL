Looking Ahead to 1965 



'T~'he other day we got a note 
from Horace Gold, enclos- 
ing a ten-year-old clipping with 
the suggestion that we might 
want to write an editorial about 
it. He was right. We do. The 
clipping came from Coronet, 
issue of October, 1955; it was an 
article entitled -4 Look at Your 
Life — Ten Years from Today. 
It was written by Leo Cherne, 
executive director of the Re- 
search Institute of America, 
“as told to” Ray Joseph — mean- 
ing that Joseph did the writing 
on the basis of what Cherne pre- 
dicted. 

What did Cherne predict? 
“The sun will heat your house, a 
jet engine will power your two 
cars — and atomic radiation will 



preserve food in a kitchen that 
disappears,” said Coronet’s blurb. 
So far the score is zero; but as 
we go deeper into the article we 
come across a lot of better guess- 
es. Trans- Atlantic jet travel in 
five hours? Right on the nose. 
Wide use of contraceptive pills? 
Check. Color television sets cost- 
ing $300 or less? Very close; 
they’re coming onto the market 
now. 

Short of reprinting the whole 
article, it is hard to select the 
exact predictions that succeeded 
and those that failed and com- 
pile a box score, but in general 
for every guess that was wrong 
about the'technology of “tomor- 
row”, there was at least one other 
guess that was amazingly right.

Solar-heated houses, jet automo- 
bile engines, nuclear-powered 
ocean liners — wrong; but plastic 
back-yard swimming pools, “in- 
creasingly complex business ma- 
chines” and space vehicles in or- 
bit, absolutely right. Mr. Cherne 
looks very good as a prophet . 
until you come to consider an- 
other class of predictions made 
in his 1955 forecast. For example, 
these : 

“The most profound change to 
take place in the world will be 
the elimination of world war . 
You will have peace.” 

“By 1965, the U.S. will have 
come successfully through a de- 
pression in which 6,000,000 will 
have been unemployed.” 

“Strikes will be rare.” 

A s anyone who reads the daily 
newspapers knows, we don’t 
have peace, we didn’t have the 
depression . and we do have 
strikes. Oh, that we do; lots of 
them. 

What went wrong? 

Perhaps the difference is as 
simple as the difference between 
the “hard” sciences and the “soft” 
ones — technology is intrinsically 
predictable, social changes are in- 
trinsically not. But even if we 
don’t have a science of social be- 
havior, it is useful to try to ob- 
serve patterns if they exist; and 
there is a glimmering of a pat- 



tern here. Why do we not have 
peace? Because the nations of the 
world decline to give up any 
meaningful part of their God- 
given right to do whatever they, 
in their own sole judgment, think 
they might enjoy. Why do we 
still have staggeringly costly 
strikes? Because trade unions 
and employers behave no more 
sensibly than foreign ministers. 

But why did we not have 
the depression? Because as soon 
as one threatened, and each 
time one threatened, government 
spending and government tax re- 
lief was increased to flood the 
economy with money. 

Of Cherne’s social predictions 
that went wrong, two rested on 
his opinion that large groups 
would order their activities on 
the basis of long-range results. 
He was optimistic, and he was 
wrong. The third rested on his 
estimate that a similar large 
group could not respond quickly 
enough to a short-range chal- 
lenge. But it did. 

We human beings do pretty 
well with emergencies. Not so 
well with planning ahead. 

Isn’t it about time we began 
looking a little deeper into con- 
sequences? Or, as someone said 
at a recent convention of busi- 
ness leaders, “Can’t we find time 
to act on what is important, in- 
stead of what is merely urgent?”

PART ONE 



HEISENBERG'S 



The Opfimen could Idfl any man 

in the world, or ail of them. 

But Something killed OptimenI 



'"T^/iey would schedule a rain for 
-*■ this morning, Dr. Thei Syen- 
gaard thought. Rain always 
aiakes the parents uneasy . 
not to mention what it does to 
the doctors. 

A gust of winter wetness rat- 
tled against the window behind 



his desk. He stood, thought of 
muting the windows, but the 
Durants — this morning’s parents 
— might be even more alarmed 
by the unnatural silence on such 
a day. 

Dr. Svengaard stepped to the 
window, looked down at the 
thronging foot traffic — day shifts 
going to their jobs in the megal-

EYES 



opoHs, night shifts headed toward 
their tumbled rest. There was a 
sense of power and movement in 
the comings and goings of the 
people in spite of their trog- 
lodyte existence. Most of them, 
he knew, were childless Sterries 
. sterile. They came and they 
went, numbered, but numberless. 

He had left the intercom open 
to his reception room and he 
could hear his nurse, Mrs. Wash- 
ington, distracting the Durants 
with questions and forms. 

Routine. 

That was the watchword. This 
must all appear normal, casual 



by FRANK HERBERT 



Illustrated by ADKINS 



routine. The Durants and all the 
others fortunate enough to be 
chosen and to become parents 
must never suspect the truth. 

Dr. Svengaard steered his 
mind away from such thoughts, 
reminding himself that guilt was 
not a permissible emotion for a 
member of the medical profes- 
sion. Guilt led inevitably to be- 
trayal . and betrayal brought 
messy consequences. The Optim- 
en were exceedingly touchy 
where the breeding program was 
concerned. 

Such a thought with its hint of 
criticism filled Svengaard with a 



9 



momentary disquiet. He swal- 
lowed and allowed his mind to 
dwell on the Folk response to the 
Optimen: They are the power 
that loves us and cares for us. 

With a sigh, he turned away 
from the window, skirted the 
desk and went through the door 
that led via the ready room to 
the lab. In the ready room, he 
paused to check his appearance 
in the mirror; gray hair, dark 
brown eyes, strong chin, high 
forehead and rather grim lips be- 
neath an aqualine nose. He’d al- 
ways been rather proud of the 
remote dignity in his appearance- 
cut and had come to terms with 
the need of adjusting the remote- 
ness. Now, he softened the set of 
his mouth, practiced a look of 
compassionate interest. 

Yes, that would do for the 
Durants — granting the accuracy 
of their emotional profiles. 

XTurse Washington was just 
-*■ ^ ushering the Durants into 
the lab as Dr. Svengaard entered 
through his private door. The 
skylights above them drummed 
and hissed with the rain. Such 
weather suddenly seemed to fit 
the room’s mood: washed glass, 
steel, plasmeld and tile ... all 
impersonal. It rained on every- 
one. And all humans had to pass 
through a room such as this . 
even the Optimen. 

Dr. Svengard took an instant 



dislike to the parents. Harvey 
Durant was a lithe six-footer with 
curly blond hair, light blue eyes. 
The face was wide with an ap- 
parent innocence and youth. Liz- 
beth, his wife, stood almost the 
same height, equally blonde, 
equally blue-eyes and young. 
Her figure suggested valkyrie 
robustness. On a silver cord 
around her neck she wore one of 
the omnipresent Folk talismen, 
a brass figure of the female Op- 
timan, Calapine. The breeder 
cult nonsense and religious over- 
tones of the figures did not es- 
cape Dr. Svengaard. He sup- 
pressed a sneer. 

The Durants were parents, 
however, and robust — living 
testimony to the skill of the sur- 
geon who had cut them. Dr. 
Svengaard allowed himself a 
moment of pride in his profes- 
sion. Not many people could en- 
ter the tight little group of sub- 
cellular engineers who kept hu- 
man variety within bounds. 

Nurse Washington paused in 
the door behind the Durants, 
said; “Dr. Svengaard, Harvey 
and Lizbeth Durant.” She left 
without waiting for acknowledge- 
ments. Nurse Washington’s tim- 
ing and discretion always were 
exquisitely correct. 

“The Durants, how nice,” Dr. 
Svengaard said. “I hope my 
nurse didn’t bore you with all 
those forms and questions. But I

guess you knew you were letting 
yourselves in for all that routine 
when you asked to watch. Didn’t 
you?” 

“We understand,” Harvey 
Durant said. And he thought: 
Asked us to watch, indeed! If 
this old fake thinks he can pull 
his little tricks on us, he’s got a 
surprise coming! 

Dr. Svengaard noted the rich, 
compelling baritone of the man’s 
voice. It bothered him and add- 
ed to his dislike of the couple 
standing before him. 

“We don’t want to take any 
more of your time than absolute- 
ly necessary,” Lizbeth said. 

She clasped her husband’s 
hand and , through their secret 
code of finger pressures said : 
Do you read him? He doesn’t 
like us. 

Harvey’s fingers responded : 
He’s a Sterrie prig, so full of 
pride in his position that he’s 
half blind. But we know our 
rights 'and won’t let him take ad- 
vantage of us. 

The woman’s no-nonsense tone 
annoyed Dr. Svengaard. She al- 
ready was staring around the lab 
with quick,' searching looks. / 
must keep control here, he 
thought. He crossed to them and 
shook hands. Their palms were 
sweaty. To the experienced doc- 
tor, this was an excellent sign. 

Nervous. Good, Dr. Svengaard 
thought. 

12 



The sound of a viapump at 
his left seemed reassuringly loud 
to him then. You could count 
on the pump to make parents 
nervous. That was why the 
pumps were loud. Dr. Svengaard 
turned toward the sound, indi- 
cated a sealed crystal vat on a 
force-field stand near the lab’s 
center. The pump sound came 
from the vat. 

“Here we are,” Dr. Svengaard 
said. 

T izbeth stared at the vat’s 
^ ^ milky transluscent surface. 
She wet her lips with her ton- 
gue. “In there?” 

“And as safe as can be,” Dr. 
Svengaard said. 

He cherished the small hope 
then that the Durants might yet 
leave, go home and await the 
outcome. 

Harvey took his wife’s hand, 
patted it. He, too, stared at the 
vat. “We understand you’ve 
called in this specialist,” he 
said. 

“Dr. Potter,” Svengaard said. 
“From Central.” He glanced at 
the nervous movements of the 
Durants’ hands, noting the omni- 
present tatooed index fingers 
which announced their gene type 
and station. They could add the 
coveted “V” for viable now, he 
thought, and he suppressed a 
momentary jealousy. 

“Dr. Potter, yes,” Harvey 

GALAXY 



said. Through their hands, he 
signaled Lizbeth: “Notice how 
he said Central?” 

How could I miss it? she ask- 
ed. 

Central, she thought. The 
place conjured pictures of the 
lordly Optimen, but this made 
her think of the Cyborgs who se- 
cretly opposed the Optimen, and 
the whole thing filled her with 
profound disquiet. She could af- 
ford to think of nothing but her 
son now. 

“We know Potter’s the best 
there is,” she said, “and we don’t 
want you to think we’re just be- 
ing emotional and fearful . .” 

“. but we’re going to watch,” 
Harvey said. And he thought: 
This stiff-necked surgeon had 
better realize we know our legal 
rights. 

“I see,” Dr. Svengaard said. 
Damn these fools! he thought. 
But he held his voice to a sooth- 
ing monotone as he said: “Your 
concern is a matter of record. I 
admire it. However, the conse- 
quences . .” 

He left the v/ords hanging 
there, reminding them that he 
had legal rights, too. He could 
make the cut with or without 
their permission, and couldn’t be 
held responsible for any upset to 
parents. Public Law 10927 was 
clear and direct. Parents might 
invoke it for the right to watch, 
but the cut would be made at 



the surgeon’s discretion. The hu- 
man race had a planned future 
which excluded genetic monsters 
and wild deviants. 

Harvey nodded, a quick and 
emphatic motion. He gripped his 
wife’s hand tightly. Bits of Folk 
horror stories and official myths 
trickled through his mind. He 
saw Svengaard partly through 
this confusion of stories and part- 
ly through the clandestine for- 
bidden literature grudgingly pro- 
vided by the Cyborgs to the Par- 
ents Underground — through 
Stedman and Merck, through 
Shakespeare and Huxley. His 
youth had fed on such a limited 
past that he knew superstition 
could not help but remain. 

Lizbeth ’s nod came slower. She 
knew what their chief concern 
here had to be, but that was still 
her son in the vat. 

“Are you sure,” she asked, de- 
liberately baiting Svengaard, 
“that there’s no pain?” 

The extent of the Folk non- 
sense which bred in the necessary 
atmosphere of popular ignorance 
filled Dr. Svengaard with resent- 
ment. He knew he’d have to end 
this interview quickly. The things 
he might be saying to these peo- 
ple kept intruding in his aware- 
ness, interfering with what he had 
to say. 

“That fertilized ovum has no 
nerve trains,” he said. “It’s phy- 
sically less than three hours old, 

I.*? 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



its growth retarded by controlled 
nitrate respiration. Pain? The 
concept doesn’t apply.” 

The technical terms would 
have little meaning to them. Dr. 
Svengaard knew — other than lo 
emphasize the distance betw'een 
mere parents and a submolecular 
engineer. 

“I guess that was rather fool- 
ish of me,” Lizbeth said. “The 
. it’s so simple, not really like 
a human yet.” And she signaled 
to Harvey through their hands: 
What a simpleton he is! As easy 
to read as a child. 

Rain beat a tarantella against 
the skylight. Dr. Svengaard wait- 
ed it out, then: “Ah, now — let 
us make no mistakes.” And he 
thought what an excellent mo- 
ment it was to give these fools a 
catechism refresher. “Your em- 
bryo may be less than three hours 
old, but it already contains every 
basic enzyme it’ll need when fully 
developed. An enormously com- 
plicated organism.” 

Harvey stared at him in as- 
sumed awe at the greatness 
which could understand such 
mysteries as the shaping and 
moulding of life. 

II 

^^wo days ago, selected gam- 
etes from Harvard and her- 
self had been united there, grip- 
ped in stasis, allowed to go 



through limited mitosis. The 
process had produced a viable 
embryo — not too common a 
thing in their world where only a 
select few were freed of the con- 
traceptive gas and allowed to 
breed and only a rare number of 
those produced viables. She 
wasn’t supposed to understand 
the intricacies of the process, and 
the fact that she did understand 
had to be hidden at all times. 
They — the genetic Optimen of 
Central — stamped savagely on 
the slightest threat to their su- 
premacy. And they considered 
knowledge in the wrong hands to 
be the most terrible threat. 

“How . big is ... he now?” 
she asked. 

“Diameter less than a tenth of 
a millimeter,” Dr. Svengaard 
said. He relaxed his face into a 
smile. “It’s a morula and back in 
the primitive days it wouldn’t yet 
have completed its journey to the 
uterus. This is the stage when 
it’s most susceptible to us. We 
must do our work now before the 
formation of the trophoblast.” 

The Durants nodded in awe. 

Dr. Svengaard basked in their 
respect. He sensed their minds 
fumbling over poorly remember- 
ed definitions from the limited 
schooling they’d been permitted. 
Their records said she was a 
creche librarian and he an in- 
structor of the young — not much 
education required for either.

Harvey touched the vat, jerk- 
ed his hand away. The crystal 
surface felt warm, filled with 
subtle vibrations. And there was 
that constant thiap-thiap-thiap 
of the pump. He sensed the de- 
liberateness of that annoying 
sound, reading, the way he’d 
been trained in the Underground, 
the subtle betrayals in Sven- 
gaard’s manner. He glanced 
around the laboratory. Glass 
pipes, square gray cabinets, shiny 
angles and curves of plasmeld, 
omnipresent gauges like staring 
eyes. The place smelled of dis- 
infectants and exotic chemicals. 
Everything about the lab carried 
that calculated double purpose 
— functional in design but con- 
structed in such as way as to 
awe the uninitiated. 

Lizbeth focused on the one 
mundane feature of the place she 
could recognize for certain — a 
tile sink with gleaming faucets. 
The sink sat squeezed between 
two mysterious constructions of 
convoluted glass and dull gray 
plasmeld. 

The sink bothered Lizbeth. It 
represented a place of disposal. 
You flushed garbage into a sink 
for grinding before it was washed 
into the sewage reclamation sys- 
tem. Anything small could 
easily be dumped into a sink 
and lost. 

Forever. 

Anything. 



CCT’m not going to be talked 

- 8 - out of watching,” she 
said. 

Damn! Dr. Svengaard thought. 
There w*as a catch in her voice. 
That little catch, that hesitation 
was betrayal. It didn’t fit with her 
bold appearance. Overemphasis 
on maternal drive in her cutting 
... no matter how successful the 
surgeon had been with the rest 
of her. 

“Our concern is for you as 
much as for your child,” Dr. 
Svengaard said. “The trauma . .” 

“The law gives us the right,” 
Harvey said. And he signaled to 
Lizbeth: The whole pattern’s 

more or less what we anticipated. 

Trust this clod to know the 
law, Dr. Svengaard thought. He 
sighed. Statistical prediction said 
one in one hundred thousand par- 
ents would insist despite all the 
subtle and not so subtle pres- 
sures against it. Statistics and 
visible fact, however, were two 
distinct rnatters. Svengaard had 
noted how Harvey glared at him. 
The man’s cutting had been 
strong on male protectiveness — 
too strong, obviously. He couldn’t 
stand to see his mate thwarted. 
Doubtless he was an excellent 
provider, model husband, never 
participated in Sterrie orgies — a 
leader. 

A Clod. 

“The law,” Dr. Svengaard said, 
and his voice dripped rebuke.

“also requires tliat I point out the 
dangers of psychological trauma 
to the parents. I was not suggest- 
ing I’d try to prevent you from 
watching.” 

“We’re going to watch,” Liz- 
beth said. 

Harvey felt a surge of admira- 
tion for her then. She played her 
role so beautifully, even to that 
catch in her voice. 

“I couldn’t stand the waiting 
otherwise,” Lizbeth said. “Not 
knowing . .” 

Dr. Svengaard wondered if he 
dared press the matter — perhaps 
an appeal to their obvious awe, a 
show of Authority. One look at 
Harvey’s squared shoulders and 
Lizbeth’s pleading eyes dissuaded 
him. They were going to watch. 

“Very well,” Dr. Svengaard 
sighed. 

“Will we watch from here?” 
Harvey asked. 

Dr. Svengaard was shocked. 
“Of course not!” What primi- 
tives, these clods! But he tem- 
pered the thought with realiza- 
tion that such ignorance resulted 
from the carefully fostered mys- 
tery that surrounded gene shap- 
ing. In a calmer tone, he said: 
“You’ll have a private room with 
a closed-circuit connection to this 
lab. My nurse will escort you.” 

Nurse Washington proved her 
competence then by appearing 
in the doorway. She’d been list- 
ening, of course. A good nurse 



never left such matters to chance. 

“Is this all we get to see here?” 
Lizbeth asked. 

Dr. Svengaard heard the plead- 
ing tone, noted the way she 
avoided looking directly at the 
vat. All his pent-up scorn came 
out in his voice as he said : “What 
else is there to see, Mrs. Durant? 
Surely you didn’t expect to see 
the morula.” 

Harvey tugged at his wife’s 
arm, said: “Thank you. Doctor.” 

Once more, Lizbeth’s eyes 
scanned the room, avoiding the 
vat. “Yes, thank you for showing 
us . this room. It helps to see 
how . prepared you are for . 
every emergency.” Her eyes fo- 
cused on the sink. 

“You’re quite welcome, I’m 
sure,” Dr. Svengaard said. “Nurse 
Washington will provide you with 
the list of permissable names. 
You might occupy part of your 
time choosing a name for your 
son if you’ve not already done 
so.” He nodded to the nurse. “See 
the Durants to Lounge Five, 
please.” 

Nurse Washington said: “If 
you’ll follow me, please?” She 
turned with that air of overwork- 
ed impatience which Svengaard 
suspected all nurses acquired 
with their diplomas. The Durants 
were sucked up in her wake. 

S vengaard turned back to the 
vat.

So much to do — Potter, the 
specialist from Central, due with- 
in the hour . and he wouldn’t 
be happy about the Durants. Peo- 
ple had so little understanding of 
what the medical profession en- 
dured. The psychological prepar- 
ation of parents subtracted from 
time better devoted to more im- 
portant matters . and it cer- 
tainly complicated the security 
problem. Svengaard thought of 
the five “Destroy After Reading” 
directives he’d received from Max 
Allgood, Central’s boss of T-Se- 
curity during the past month. It 
was disturbing, as though some 
new danger had set Security 
scurrying. 

But Central insisted on the so- 
cializing with parents. The Opti- 
men must have good reason, 
Svengaard felt. Most things they 
did made wonderful sense. Some- 
times, Svengaard knew, he fell 
into a feeling of orphanage, a 
creature without past. All it took 
to shake him from the emotional 
morass, though, was a moment’s 
contemplation: They are the 

power that loves us and cares for 
us. They had the world firmly in 
their grip, the future planned — a 
place for every man and every 
man in his place. Some of the old 
dreams — space travel, the quest- 
ing philosophies, farming of the 
seas — had been shelved tem- 
porarily, put aside for more im- 
portant things. The day would 



come, though, once they solved 
the unknowns behind submolec- 
ular engineering. 

Meanwhile, there was work for 
the willing — maintaining the 
population of workers, suppress- 
ing deviants, husbanding the ge- 
netic pool from which even the 
Optimen sprang. 

Svengaard swung the meson 
microscope over the Durant vat, 
adjusted for low amplification to 
minimize Heisenberg interfer- 
ence. One more look wouldn’t 
hurt, just on the chance he might 
locate the pilot-cell and reduce 
Potter’s problem. 

Even as he bent to the scope, 
Svengaard knew he was ration- 
alizing. He couldn’t resist another 
search into this morula which had 
the potential, might be shaped 
into an Optiman. The wonderous 
things were so rare. He flicked 
the switch, focused. 

A sigh escaped him : “Ahhh — ” 

So passive the morula at low 
amplification ; no pulsing as it lay 
within the stasis — yet so beau- 
tiful in its semi-dormancy . 
so little to hint that it was the 
arena of ancient battles. 

Svengaard put a hand to the 
amplification controls, hesitated. 
High amplification posed its dan- 
gers, but Potter could readjust 
minor marks of meson interfer- 
ence. And the big look was very 
tempting. 

He doubled amplification. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



17 



ST nlargement always reduced 
the appearance of stasis, 
'fhings moved here, and in the 
unfocused distances there were 
flashes like the dartings of fish. 
Up out of the swarming arena 
came the triple spiral of nucleo- 
tides that had led him to call 
Potter. Almost Optiman. Almost 
that beautiful perfection of form 
and mind that could accept the 
indefinite balancing of Life 
through the delicately adjusted 
enzyme prescriptions. 

A sense of loss pervaded Sven- 
gaard. His own prescription, while 
it kept him alive, was slowly kill- 
ing him. It was the fate of all 
men. They might live two hun- 
dred years, sometimes even more 
. but in the end the balancing 
act failed for all except the Opti- 
men. They were perfect, limited 
only by their physical sterility, 
but that was the fate of many 
humans and it subtracted noth- 
ing from endless life. 

His own childless state gave 
Svengaard a sense of communion 
with the Optimen. They’d solve 
that, too . some day. 

He concentrated on the moru- 
la. A sulfur-containing amino acid 
dependency showed faint motion 
at this amplification. With a feel- 
ing of shock, Svengaard recog- 
nized it — isovalthine, a genetic 
marker for latent myxedema, a 
warning of potential thyroid de- 
ficiency. It was a disquieting flaw 



in the otherwise near-perfection 
Potter would have to be alerted. 

Svengaard backed off amplifi- 
cation to study the mitochondrial 
structure. He followed out the 
invaginated unit-membrane to 
the flattened, sac-hke cristae, re- 
turned along the external second 
membrane, focused on the hydro- 
philic outer compartment. Yes 
. the isovalthine was suscep- 
tible to adjustment. Perfection 
might yet be for this morula. 

Flickering movement appeared 
at the edge of the microscope’s 
field. 

Svengaard stiffened, thought: 
Dear God, no! 

He stood frozen at the viewer 
as a thing seen only eight pre- 
vious times in the history of gene- 
shaping took place within his 
field of vision. 

A thin line like a distant con- 
trail reached into the cellu- 
lar structure from the left. It 
wound through a coiled- coil of 
alpha helices, found the folded 
ends of the polypeptide chains 
in a myosin molecule, twisted 
and dissolved. 

Where the trail had been now 
lay a new structure about four 
Angstroms in diameter and a 
thousand Angstroms long — 
sperm protamine rich in arginine. 
All around it the protein factor- 
ies of the cytoplasm were under- 
going change, fighting the stasis.

realigning. Svengaard recognized 
what was happening from the 
descriptions of the eight previous 
occurences. The ADP-ATP ex- 
change system was becoming 
more complex — “resistant.” The 
surgeon’s job had been made in- 
finitely more complex. 

Potter will be furious, Sven- 
gaard thought. 

Svengaard turned off the mi- 
croscope, straightened. He wiped 
perspiration from his hands, 
glanced at the lab clock. Less 
than two minutes had passed. 
The Durants weren’t even in their 
lounge yet. But in those two min- 
utes, some force . some energy 
from outside had made a seem- 
ingly purposeful adjustment 
within the embryo. 

Could this be what’s stirred up 
Security . and the Optimen? 
Svengaard wondered. 

He had heard this thing de- 
scribed, read the reports . but 
actually to have seen it himself! 
To have seen it ... so sure and 
purposeful . 

He shook his head. No! It was 
not purposeful! It was merely an 
'accident, chance, nothing more. 

But the vision wouldn’t leave 
him. 

Compared to that, he thought. 
how clumsy my efforts are. And 
I’ll have to report it to Potter. 
Hdll have to shape that twisted 
chain ... if he can now that it’s 
resistant. 



Full of disquiet, not at all sat- 
isfied that he had seen an acci- 
dent, Svengaard began making 
the final check of the lab’s pre- 
parations. He inspected the en- 
zyme racks and their linkage to 
the computer dosage- control. 
Plenty of cytochrome bs and P- 
450 hemoprotein, a good reserve 
store of ubiquinone and sulfhy- 
dryl, arsenate, azide and oligomy- 
cin, sufficient protein-bound 
phosphohistidine. He moved 
down the line — acylating agents, 
a store of (2, 4-dinitrophenol) 
and the isoxazolidon-3 groups 
with reduction NADH. 

He turned to the physical 
equipment, checked the meson 
scalpel’s micromechanism, read 
the life-system gauges on the vat 
and the print-out of the stasis 
mechanism. 

All in order. 

It had to be. The Durant em- 
bryo, that beautiful thing with 
its wondrous potential, was now 
resistant — a genetic unknown . 
if Potter could succeed where 
others had failed. 

Ill 

T>r. Vyaslav Potter stopped at 
the Records Desk on his way 
into the hospital. He was faintly 
tired after the long tube-shunt

polis; still he told an off-color 
joke about primitive reproduc-

tion to the gray-haired duty 
nurse. She chuckled as she hunt- 
ed up Svengaard’s latest report 
on the Durant embryo. She put 
the report on the counter, stared 
at Potter. 

He glanced at the folder’s cov- 
er, looked up to meet the nurse’s 
eyes. 

7s it possible? he wondered. 
But . no. She’s too old. 
Wouldn’t even make a good play- 
mate. Anyway, the bigdomes 
wouldn’t grant us a breeding per- 
mit. And he reminded himself: 
I’m a Zeek ... a J^llllS^K. The 
Zeek gene-shaping had gone 
through a brief popularity in the 
region of Timbuctu Megalopolis 
during the early nineties. It pro- 
duced curly black hair, a skin one 
shade lighter than milk choco- 
late, soft brown eyes and a roly- 
poly face of utmost benignity, all 
on a tall, strong body. A Zeek. A 
Vyaslav Potter. 

It had yet to produce an Opti- 
man, male or female, and never 
a viable gamete match. 

Potter had long since given up. 
He was one of those who’d voted 
to discontinue the Zeek. He 
thought of the Optimen with 
whom he dealt and sneered at 
himself : There but for the brown 
eyes . But the sneer no longer 
gave him a twinge of bitterness. 

“You know,” he said, smiling 
at the nurse, “these Durants 
whose Emb I have this morning 



— I cut them both. Maybe I’ve 
been in this business too long.” 

“Oh, go on with you. Doctor,” 
she said with an arch turn of her 
head. “You’re not even middle- 
aged. You don’t look a day over 
a hundred.” 

He glanced at the folder. “But 
here are these kids bringing me 
their emb to cut and I . .” He 
shrugged. 

“Are you going to tell them?” 
she asked. “I mean that you had 
them, too.” 

“I probably won’t even see 
them,” he said. “You know how 
it is. Anyway, sometimes people 
are unhappy with their cut. Some- 
times they wish they’d had a 
little more of this, less of that. 
They tend to blame the surgeon. 
They don’t understand, can’t un- 
derstand the problems we have 
in the cutting room.” 

“But the Durants seem like a 
very successful cut,” she said. 
“Normal. Happy. Perhaps a little 
over-worried about their son, 
but . .” 

“Their genotype is one of the 
most successful,” he said. He tap- 
ped the record folder with a 
forefinger. “Here’s the proof : 
they had a viable with poten- 
tial.” He lifted a thumb in the 
time-honored gesture for Opti- 
rnan. 

“You should be very proud of 
them,” she said. “My family’s had 
only fifteen viables in a hundred

and eighty-nine years, and never 
an . She repeated Potter’s 
thumb gestuf'e. 

He pursed his lips into a moae 
of commiseration, wondering how 
he let himself get drawn into 
these conversations with women, 
especially with nurses. It -was 
that little seed of hope that never 
died, he suspected. It was cut 
from the same stuff that pro- 
duced the wild rumors, the quack 
“breeder doctors” and the black 
market in “true breed” nostrums. 
It was the thing that sold the 
little figurines of Optiman-Cala- 
pine because of the unfounded 
rumor that she had produced a 
viable. It was the thing that wore 
out the big toes of fertility idols 



from the kisses of the hopeful. 

His moue of commiseration be- 
came a cynical sneer. Hopeful! If 
they only knew. 

“Were you aware the Durants 
are going to watch?” the Nurse 
asked. 

T T is head jerked up and he 
glared at her. 

“It’s all over the hospital,” she 
said. “Security’s been alerted. 
The Duran ts’ve been scanned and 
they’re in Lounge Five with clos- 
ed circuit to the cutting room.” 
Anger blazed through him. 
“Damn it to hell! Can’t they do 
anything right here?” 

“Now, Doctor,” she said, stiff- 
ening into the prim departmental

dictator. “There’s no call to lose 
your temper. The Durants quot- 
ed the law. That ties our hands 
and you know it.” 

“Stupid damn law,” Potter 
muttered, but his anger had sub- 
sided. The law! he thought. More 
of the damn masquerade. He had 
to admit, though, that they need- 
ed the law. Without Public Law 
10927, people might ask the 
wrong kinds of questions. And no 
doubt Svengaard had done his 
bumbling best to try to dissuade 
the Durants. 

Potter assumed a rueful grin, 
said; “Sorry I snapped like that. 
I’ve had a bad week.” He sighed. 
“They just don’t understand.” 
“Is there any other record you 
wish. Doctor?” she asked. 

Rapport was gone, Potter saw. 
“No, thanks,” he said. He took 
the Durant folder, headed for 
Svengaard’s office. Just his luck: 
a pair of watchers. It meant plen- 
ty of extra work. Naturally! 

The Durants couldn’t be con- 
tent with seeing the tape after 
the cut. Oh, no. They had to be 
on the scene. That meant the 
Durants weren’t as innocent as 
they might appear — no matter 
what this hospital’s Security staff 
said. The public just did not in- 
sist any more. That was supposed 
to’ve been cut out of them. 

The statistical few who defied 
their genetic shaping now re- 
quired special attention. 



And Potter reminded himself : 
/ did the original cut on this 
pair. There was no mistake. 

He ran into Svengaard outside 
the latter’s office, heard the 
man’s quick resume. Svengaard 
then began babbling about his 
Security arrangements. 

“I don’t give a damn what 
your Security people say,” Pot- 
ter barked. “We’ve new instruc- 
tions. Central Emergency’s to be 
called in every case of this kind.” 

They went into Svengaard’s of- 
fice. It pretended to be wood 
paneling — a corner room with a 
view of flowered roof gardens 
and terraces built of the omni- 
present three-phase regenerative 
plasmeld, the “plasty” of the 
Folk patois. Nothing must age or 
degenerate in this best of all 
Optiman worlds. Nothing except 
people. 

“Central Emergency?” Sven- 
gaard asked. 

“No exceptions,” Potter said. 
He sat in Svengaard’s chair, put 
his feet on Svengaard’s desk and 
brought the little ivory-colored 
phone box to his stomach with 
its screen only inches from his 
face. He punched in Security’s 
number and his own code identi- 
fication. 

Qvengaard sat on a comer of the 
^ desk across from him appear- 
ing both angry and cowed. 

“They were scanned, I tell

you,” Svengaard said. “They were 
carrying no unusual devices. 
There’s nothing unusual about 
them.” 

“Except they insist on watch- 
ing,” Potter said. He jiggled the 
phone key. “What’s keeping 
those ignoramuses?” 

Svengaard said: “But the 

law . .” 

“Damn the law!” Potter said. 
“You know as well as I do that 
we could route the view signal 
from the cutting room through an 
editing computer and show the 
parents anything we want. Has 
it ever occurred to you to won- 
der why we don’t do just that?” 
“Why . they . ahh . .” 
Svengaard shook his head. The 
question had caught him off bal- 
ance. Why wasn’t that done? 
The statistics showed a certain 
number of parents would insist 
on watching and . 

“It was tried,” Potter said. 
“Somehow, the parents detected 
the computer’s hand in the tape.” 
“How?” 

“We don’t know.” 

“Weren’t the parents question- 
ed and . .” 

“They killed themselves.” 
“Killed them . How?” 

“We don’t know.” 

“We don’t know!” Potter 
echoed sarcastically. 

A heavy masculine voice came 
from the phone: “Who’re you 
talking to?” 



Potter focused on the screen, 
said : “I was talking to Sven. This 
viable he called me on . .” 

“It is a viable?” 

“Yes! It’s a viable with the full 
potential, but the parents insist 
on watching.” 

“I’ll have a full crew on the 
way by tube in ten minutes,” said 
the voice on the phone. “They’re 
at Friscopolis. Shouldn’t take ’em 
more than a few minutes.” 
Svengaard rubbed dry palms 
against the sides of his working 
smock. He couldn’t see that face 
on the phone, but the voice 
sounded like Max Allgood, T- 
Security’s boss. 

“We’ll delay the cut until your 
people get here,” Potter said. 
“The records are being faxed to 
you and should be on your desk 
in a few minutes. There’s anoth- 
er . .” 

“Is that embryo everything we 
were told?” asked the man on the 
phone. “Any flaws?” 

“A latent myxedema, a projec- 
tive faulty heart valve, but the — ” 
“Okay, I’ll call you after I’ve 
seen the . .” 

“Damn it to hell!” Potter 
erupted. “Will you let me get ten 
words out of my mouth without 
interrupting?” He glared into the 
screen. “There’s something here 
more important than flaws and 
the parents.” Potter glanced up 
at Svengaard, back to the screen. 
“Sven reports he saw an outside

adjustment of the arginine defic- 
iency.” 

A low whistle came from the 
phone, then: “Reliable?” 
“Depend on it.” 

“Did it follow the pattern of 
the other eight?” 

Potter glanced up at Sven- 
gaard, who nodded. 

“Sven says yes.” 

“They won’t like that.” 

“I don’t like it.” 

“Did Sven see enough to get 
any . new ideas on it?” 
Svengaard shook his head. 
“No,” Potter said. 

“There’s a strong possibility it 
isn’t significant,” the man on the 
phone said. “In a system of in- 
creasing determinism . .” 

“Oh, yes,” Potter sneered. “In 
a system of increasing determin- 
ism you get more and more inde- 
terminism. You might as well say 
in a foofram of increasing hag- 
gersmaggle . .” 

“Well, it’s what they believe,” 
he said. 

“So they say. I believe Nature 
doesn’t like being meddled with.” 
Potter stared into the screen. 
For some reason, he recalled his 
youth, the beginning of his medi- 
cal studies and the day he’d 
learned how very close his geno- 
type had been to the Optiman. 
He found that the old core of 
hatred had become mildly amus- 
ed tolerance and C5micism. 



“I don’t see why they put up 
with you,” the man on the phone 
said. 

“Because I was very close,” 
Potter whispered. He wondered 
then how close the Durant em- 
bryo would be. I'll do my best, 
he thought. 

The man on the phone cleared 
his throat, said: “Yes, well I’ll de- 
pend on you to handle things at 
your end. The embryo ought to 
provide some verification of the 
outside inter . .” 

“Don’t be a total ass!” Potter 
snapped. “The emb will bear out 
Svan’s report to the last enzyme. 
You tend to your job; we’ll do 
ours.” He slapped the cut-off, 
pushed the phone back onto the 
desk and sat staring at it. “Pom- 
pous damned ... no — he’s what 
he is because he’s what he is. 
Comes from living too close to 
them. Comes from the original 
cut. Maybe I’d be an ass too if 
that’s what I had to be,” he ob- 
served cynically. 

Svengaard tried to swallow in a 
dry throat. He’d never before 
heard such an argument or such 
frank talk from the men who op- 
erated out of Central. He was 
more than a little surprised. 

“Shocked you, eh, Sven?” 
Potter asked. He dropped his feet 
to the floor and waited for the 
man in front of him to answer. 

Svengaard shrugged. He felt ill 
at ease.

■potter studied the man. Sven- 
-*■ gaard was good within his lim- 
its, but he lacked creative imag- 
ination. A brilliant surgeon, but 
without that special quality he 
was often a dull too. 

“You’re a good man, Sven,” 
Potter said. “Dependable. That’s 
what your record says, you know. 
Dependable. You’ll never be any- 
thing else. Weren’t meant to be. 
In your particular niche, though, 
you’re it.” 

Svengaard heard only the 
praise, said; “It’s good to be 
appreciated, of course, but . 
“But we have work to do.” 

“It will be difficult,” Sven- 
gaard said. “Now.” 

“Do you think that outside ad- 
justment was an accidental 
thing?” Potter asked. 

“I . I’d like to believe 
that . .” Svengaard wet his lips 
with his tongue. “. it wasn’t 
determined, that no agency . .” 
“You’d like to lay it to un- 
certainty, to Heisenberg,” Potter 
said. “The principle of uncertain- 
ty. Some result of our own med- 
dling. Everything an accident in 
the capricious universe.” 

Svengaard felt stung by a qual- 
ity of harshness in Potter’s voice, 
said: “Not precisely. I meant 
only that I hoped no super casual 
agency had a hand in it.” 

“God? You don’t really mean 



you’re afraid this is the action 
of a deity?” 

Svengaard looked away. “I re- 
member in school,” he said. “You 
were lecturing. You said we al- 
ways have to be ready to face 
the fact that the reality we see 
will be shockingly different from 
anything our theories led us to 
suspect.” 

“Did I say that? Did I really 
say that?” 

“You did.” 

“Something’s out there, eh? 
Something beyond our instru- 
ments. It’s never heard of Heis- 
enberg. It isn’t uncertain at all. 
It moves.” His voice lowered. “It 
moves directly. It adjusts things.” 
He cocked his head to one side. 
“Ah, hah! The ghost of Heisen- 
berg is confounded!” 

Svengaard glared at Potter. 
The man was mocking him. He 
spoke stiffly: “Heisenberg did 
point out that we have our lim- 
its.” 

“You’re right,” Potter said. 
“There’s a caprice in our uni- 
verse. He taught us that. There’s 
always something we can’t inter- 
pret or understand ... or mea- 
sure. He set us up for this present 
dilemma, eh?” Potter glanced at 
his finger watch, back to Sven- 
gaard. “We tend to interpret ev- 
erything around us by screening 
it through that system which is 
native to us. Our civilization sees 
indeterminately through the eyes

of Heisenberg. If he taught us 
truly, how can we tell whether 
the unknown’s an accident or the 
deliberate intent of God? What’s 
the use of even asking?” 

Svengaard spoke defensively; 
“We appear to manage . some- 
how.” 

■potter startled him by laugh- 
ing, head tipped back, body 
shaking with enjoyment. The 
laughter subsided and presently 
Potter said: “Sven, you are a 
gem. I mean tiiat. If it weren’t for 
the ones like you, we’d still be 
back in the muck and mire, run- 
ning from glaciers and saber- 
tooth tigers.” 

Svengaard fought to keep an- 
ger from his voice, said; “What 
do they think this arginine ad- 
justment is?” 

Potter stared at him, measur- 
ing, then: “Damned if I haven’t 
underestimated you, Sven. Apo- 
logies, eh?” 

Svengaard shrugged. Potter 
was acting oddly today — aston- 
ishing reactions, strange eruptions 
of emotion. Do you know what 
they say about this?” he asked. 

“You heard Max on the 
phone,” Potter said. 

So that was Allgood, Sven- 
gaard thought. 

“Certainly, I know,” Potter 
growled. “Max has it all wrong. 
They say gene-shaping inflicts 
itself on nature — on a nature 



that can never be reduced to 
mechanical systems and, there- 
fore, to stationary matter. You 
can’t stop the movement, see? 
It’s an extended system phenom- 
enon, energy seeking a level.” 

“Extended system?” he asked. 

Potter looked up at the man’s 
scowling face. The question focus- 
ed Potter’s attention abruptly on 
the differences in thought pat- 
terns between those who lived 
close to Central and those who 
touched the Optiman world only 
through reports and second-hand 
associations. 

We are so different. Potter 
thought. Just as the Optimen are 
different from us and Sven here 
is different from the Sterries and 
breeders. We’re cut off from each 
other . and none of us has a 
past. Only the Optimen have a 
past. But each has an individual 
past . selfishly personal . 
and ancient. 

“Extended system,” Potter 
said. “From the microcpsmos to 
the macrocosmos, they say all is 
order and systems. The idea of 
matter is insubstantial. All is col- 
lisions of energy — some appear- 
ing large, swift and spectacular, 
some small, gentle and slow. But 
this too is relative. The aspects of 
energy are infinite. Everything 
depends on the viewpoint of the 
observer. For each change of 
viewpoint, the energy rules 
change. There exists an infinite

GAUXY 



number of energy rules, each set 
dependent on the twin aspects of 
viewpoint and background. In an 
extended system, this thini from 
outside assumes the aspect of a 
node appearing on a standing 
wave. That’s what they say.” 

Svengaard slipped off the desk, 
stood in a rapture of awe. He felt 
that he’d had a fleeting glimpse, 
a wisp of understanding that pen- 
etrated every question he might 
ask about the universe. 

Could that be what it’s like to 
work out of Central? he wonder- 
ed. 

“That’s a great summation, 
isn’t it?” Potter demanded. He 
stood up. “A truly great idea!” 
A chuckle shook him. “You know, 
a guy named Diderot had that 
idea. It was around 1750 or there- 
about. They spoon-feed it to us 
now. Great wisdom!” 

“Maybe Diderot was one of 
them,” Svengaard ventured. 

Potter sighed, thinking: How 
ignorant a man can become on a 
diet of managed history. He won- 
dered then how his own diet had 
been adjusted and managed. 

“Diderot was one of us,” Pot- 
ter growled. 

Qvengaard stared at him, shock- 
ed to silence by the man’s 
blasphemy. 

“It comes down to this,” Pot- 
ter said. “Nature doesn’t like be- 
ing meddled with.” 



A chime sounded beneath Sven- 
gaard’s desk. 

“Security?” Potter asked. 

“That’s the all clear,” Sven- 
gaard said. “They’re ready for us 
now.” 

“Central’s Security hotshots are 
all in place,” Potter said. “You 
will note that they didn’t stoop 
to report to you or to me. They 
watch us too, you know.” 

“I’ve nothing to hide,” Sven- 
gaard said. 

“Of course you haven’t,” Pot- 
ter said. He moved around the 
desk, threw an arm across Sven- 
gaard’s shoulders. “Come along. 
It’s time for us to put on the 
mask of Archeus. We’re going to 
give form and organization to a 
living body. Veritable gods, we 
are.” 

Svengaard felt himself still lost 
in confusion. “What’ll they do to 
the Durants?” he asked. 

“Do? Not a damn thing, unless 
the Durants force it. The Dur- 
ants won’t even know they’re be- 
ing watched. But Central’s little 
boys will know everything that 
goes on in that lounge. The Dur- 
ants won’t be able to belch with- 
out the gas being subjected to a 
full and complete analysis. Come 
along.” 

But Svengaard held back. “Dr. 
Potter,” he asked, “what do you 
think introduced that arginine 
chain into the Durant morula?” 

“I’m closer to you than you

think,” Potter said. “We're fight- 
ing . instability. We’ve upset 
the biological stability of the in- 
heritance patterns with our false 
isomers and our enzyme adjust- 
ments and our meson beams. 
We’ve underminded the chemical 
stability of the molecules in the 
germ plasm. You’re a doctoi. 
Look at the enzyme prescriptions 
we all have to take — how pro- 
found the adjustment we have to 
make to stay alive. It wasn’t al- 
ways that way. And whatever set 
up that original stability is still 
in there fighting. That’s what I 
think.” 

V 

''T^he cutting-room nurses posi- 
tioned the vat under the en- 
zyme console, readied the tubes 
and the computer-feed-analysis 
board. They worked quietly and 
efficiently as Potter and Sven- 
gaard examined the gauges. The 
computer nurse racked her tapes 
and there came a brief whirring 
as she tested her board. 

Potter felt himself filled with 
the wakeful anxiety that always 
came over him before surgery. 
He knew it would give way pres- 
ently to the charged sureness of 
action, but he felt snappish at 
the moment. He glanced at the 
vat gauges. The Krebs cycle 
was holding at 86.9, a good sixty 
points above death level. The vat 



nurse came over to examine his 
breather mask. He checked his 
microphone: “Mary had a little 
lamb — its fleece was black as 
hades — the surgeon took the 
credit for — a joke on all the la- 
dies.” 

He heard a distinct chuckle 
from the computer nurse, glanced 
at her, but she had her back to 
him and her face already hidden 
by hood and mask. 

The vat nurse said: “Micro- 
phone working. Doctor.” 

He couldn’t see her lips mov- 
ing behind her mask, but her 
cheeks rippled as she spoke. 

Svengaard flexed his fingers in 
their gloves, took a deep breath. 
It smelled faintly of ammonia. 
He wondered why Potter always 
joked with the nurses. It seemed 
demeaning, somehow. 

Potter moved across to the vat. 
His sterile suit crinkled with a 
familiar snapping hiss as he walk- 
ed. He glanced up at the wall 
screen, the replay monitor which 
showed approximately what the 
surgeon saw and which was the 
view watched by the parents. The 
screen presented him with a view 
of itself as he turned his forehead 
pickup lens toward it. 

Damn parents, he thought. 
They make me feel guilty. 

He returned his attention to 
the crystal vat now bristling with 
instruments. The pump’s churg- 
ling annoyed him. 



28 



GALAXY 



Svengaard moved to the other 
side of the vat, waiting. The 
breather mask hid the lower half 
of his face, but his eyes appeared 
calm. He radiated a sense of 
steadiness and reliability. 

How does he really feel? Pot- 
ter wondered. And he reminded 
himself that in an emergency 
there wasn’t a better cutting- 
room assistant than Sven. 

“You can begin increasing the 
pyruvic acid,” Potter said. 

Svengaard nodded, depressed 
the feeder key. 

The computer nurse started 
her reels turning. 

They watched the gauges as 
the Krebs cycle began rising — 
87.0 . 87.3 . 87.8 . 88.5 
. 89.4 . 90.5 . 91.9 . 

Now, Potter told himself, the 
irreversible movement of growth 
has started. Only death can stop 
it. “Tell me when the Krebs cy- 
cle reaches one hundred and ten,” 
he said. 

He swung the scope and micro- 
manipulators into place, leaned 
into the rests. Will I see what 
Sven saw? he wondered. He knew 
it wasn’t likely. The lightning 
from outside had never struck 
twice in the same place. It came. 
It did what no human hand could 
do. It went away. 

Where? Potter wondered. 

'"T^he inter-ribosomal gaps swam 
into focus. He scanned them. 



boosted amplification and went 
down into the DNA spirals. Yes 
- — there was the situation Sven 
had described. The Durant em- 
bryo was one of those that could 
cross over into the more-than- 
human land of Central ... if the 
surgeon succeeded. 

The confirmation left Potter 
oddly shaken. He shifted his at- 
tention to the mitochondrial 
structures, saw the evidence of 
the arginine intrusion. It squared 
precisely with Sven’s description. 
Alpha-helices had begun firming 
up, revealing the telltale stria- 
tions at the aneurin shifts. This 
one was going to resist the sur- 
geon. This was going to be a 
tough one. 

Potter straightened. 

“Well?” Svengaard asked. 

“Pretty much as you describ- 
ed it,” Potter said. “A straight- 
forward job.” That was for the 
watching parents. 

He wondered then what Secur- 
ity was discovering about the 
Durants. Would this pair be load- 
ed down with search and probe 
devices disguised as conventional 
artifacts? Possibly. But there 
were rumors of new techniques 
being introduced by the Parents 
Underground . and of Cyborgs 
moving out of the dark shadows 
which had hidden them for cen- 
turies. If there were Cyborgs at 
all. Potter was not convinced. 

Svengaard spoke to the com- 

29 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



puter nurse: “Start backing off 
the pyruvic.” 

“Backing off pyruvic,” she 
said. 

Potter swung his attention to 
the priority rack beside him, 
checked the presentation — in 
the first row the pyrimidines, nu- 
cleic acids and proteins, then 
aneurin, riboflavin, pyridoxin, 
pantothenic acid, folic acid, cho- 
line, inositol, sulfhydryl . 

He cleared his throat, lining up 
his plan for the attack on the 
morula’s defenses. “I will attempt 
to find a pilot cell by masking 
the cysteine at a single locus,” 
he said. “Stand by with sulfhy- 
dryl and prepare an intermediary 
tape for protein synthesis.” 

“Ready for masking,” Sven- 
gaard said. He nodded to the 
computer nurse who racked the 
intermediary tape into position 
with a smooth sureness. 

“Krebs cycle?” Pottei asked. 

“One hundred and ten corning 
up,” Svengaard said. 

Silence. 

“Mark,” Svengaard said. 

Again Potter bent to the scope. 
“Begin the tape,” he said. “Two 
minims of sulfhydryl.” 

Olowly Potter increased ampli- 
^ fication, chose a cell for the 
masking. The momentary cloud- 
ing of intrusion cleared away and 
he searched the surrounding cells 
for clues that mytosis would take 



off on his directed tangent. It 
was slow . slow. He’d just be- 
gun and his hands felt sweaty in 
their gloves. 

“Stand by with adenosine tri- 
phosphate,” he said. 

Svengaard presented the feed- 
er tube in the micromanipulators, 
nodded to the vat nurse. ATP 
already. This was going to be a 
tough one. 

“Begin one minim ATP,” Pot- 
ter said. 

Svengaard depressed the feed- 
er key. The whirring of the com- 
puter tapes sounded overly loud. 

Potter lifted his head momen- 
tarily, shook it. “Wrong cell.” he 
said. “We’ll- try another one. Same 
procedure.” 

Again he leaned into the scope 
and the rests, moved the micro- 
manipulators, pushing amplifica- 
tion up a notch at a time. Slowly 
he traced his way down into the 
cellular mass. Gently . gently 
. The scope itself could cause 
irreversible damage in here, 

Ahhh, he thought, recognizing, 
an active cell deep in the morula. 
Vat-stasis had produced only a 
relative slowing in here. The cell 
was the scene of intense chemical 
activity. He recognized doubled 
base pairs strung on a convoluted 
helix of sugar phosphate as they 
passed his field of vision. 

His beginning anxiety had 
passed and he felt the old sure- 
ness with the often repeated sen- 



30 



GALAXY 



sation that the morula was an 
ocean in which he swam, that the 
cellular interior was his natural 
habitat. 

“Two minims of sulfhydryl,” 
Potter said. 

“Sulfhydryl, two minims,” 
Svengaard said. “Standing by 
with ATP.” 

“ATP,” Potter said, then: “I’m 
going to inhibit the exchange re- 
action in the mitochondrial sys- 
tems. Start oligomycin and az- 
ide.” 

Svengaard proved his worth 
then by complying without hesi- 
tation. The only sign that he rec- 
ognized tihe dangers in this pro- 
cedure was a question: “Shall I 
have an uncoupling agent re^dy?” 

“Stand by with arsenate in 
number one,” Potter said. 

“Krebs cycle going down,” the 
computer nurse said. “Eighty- 
nine point four.” 

“Intrusion effect,” Potter said. 
“Give me point six minim of az- 
ide.” 

Svengaard depressed the key. 

- “Point four minim oligomy- 
cin,” Potter said. 

“Oligomycin, point four,” Sven- 
gaard said. 

Potter felt that he lived now 
only through his eyes on the mi- 
croscope and his hands on the 
micromanipulators. His existence 
had moved into the morula, fused 
with it. 

His eyes told him that peri- 



pheral mitosis had stopped . 
as it should under these ministra- 
tions. “I think we have it,” he 
said. He planted a marker on the 
scope position, shifted focus and 
went down into the DNA spirals, 
seeking the hydroxyl deformity, 
the flaw that would produce a 
faulty heart valve. Now he was 
the artist, the master cutter. The 
pilot cell was determined. Now 
he moved to reshape the delicate 
chemical factory of the inner 
structure. 

“Prepare for the cut,” he said. 

Ovengaard armed the meson 
^ generator. “Armed,” he said. 

“Krebs cycle seventy-one,” the 
computer nurse said. 

“First cut,” Potter said. He let 
off the single, aimed burst, watch- 
ed the tumbling chaos that fol- 
lowed. The hydroxyl appendage 
vanished. Nucleotides reformed. 

“Hemprotein P-450,” Potter 
said. “Stand by to reduce it with 
NADH.” He waited, studying the 
globular proteins that formed be- 
fore him, watching for biological- 
ly active molecules. Now! In- 
stinct and training combined to 
tell him the precise instant. “Two 
and a half minims of P-450,” he 
said. 

A corner of turmoil engaged 
a group of polypeptide chains in 
the heart of the cell. 

“Reduce it,” Potter said. 

Svengaard touched the NADH 

31

feeder key. He couldn’t see what 
Potter saw, but the surgeon’s 
forehead lens reproduced a slight- 
ly off-parallax view of the scope 
field. That plus Potter’s instruc- 
tions told of the slow spread of 
change in the cell. 

“Krebs cycle fifty-eight,” the 
computer nurse said. 

“Second cut,” Potter said. 

“Armed,” Svengaard said. 

Potter searched out the myxe- 
dema-latent isovalthine, found it. 
“Give me a tape on structure,” 
he said. “S-(isopropylcarboxy- 
methyl) cystein.” 

Computer tape hissed through 
the reels, stopped, resumed at a 
slow, steady pace. The isoval- 
thine comparison image appear- 
ed in the right quadrant of Pot- 
ter’s scope field. He compared the 
structures, point for point, said: 
“Tape off.” The comparison im- 
age vanished. 

“Krebs cycle forty-seven,” the 
computer nurse said. 

Potter took a deep, trembling 
breath. Another twenty-seven 
points and they’d be in the death 
range. The Durant embryo would 
succumb. 

He swallowed, aimed off the 
meson burst. 

Isovalthine tumbled apart. 

“Ready with cycloserine,” 
Svengaard said. 

Ahhh, good old Sven, Potter 
thought. You don’t have to tell 
him every step what to do. 



“Comparison on D-4-aminoi- 
soxazolidon-3,” Potter said. 

The computer nurse readied 
the tape, “Comparison ready.” 

The comparison image appear- 
ed in Potter’s view field. “Check,” 
he said. The image vanished. 
“One point eight minims.” He 
watched the interaction of the 
enzymic functional groups as 
Svengaard administered the cy- 
closerine. The amino group show- 
ed a nice, open field of affinity. 
Transfer -RNA fitted readily into 
its niches. 

( 4 rebs cycle thirty-eight 
point six,” the computer 
nurse said. 

We’ll have to chance it, Pot- 
ter thought. This embryo won’t 
take more adjustment. 

“Reduce vat stasis to half,” he 
said. “Increase ATP. Give me 
micro-feed on ten minims of py- 
ruvic acid.” 

“Reducing stasis,” Svengaard 
said. And he thought: This will 
be close. He keyed the ATP and 
pyruvic acid feeders. 

“Give me the Krebs cycle on 
the half point,” Potter said. 

“Thirty-five,” the nurse said. 
“Thirty-four point five. Thirty- 
four. Thirty-three point five.” 
Her voice picked up speed witli 
a shocked, breathlessness: “Thir- 
ty-three . thirty-two . 
thirty-one . thirty . twenty- 
nine .

“Release all stasis,” Potter 
said. “Present the full amino 
spectrum with activated histi- 
dine. Start pyridoxin — four point 
two minims.” 

Svengaard’s hands sped over 
the keys. 

“Back-feed the protein tape,” 
Potter ordered. “Give it the full 
DNA record on computer auto- 
matic.” 

Tapes hissed through the reels. 

“It’s slowing,” Svengaard said. 

“Twenty-two,” the computer 
nurse said. “Twenty-one nine . 
twenty-two . twenty- one nine 
. twenty-two one . twenty- 
two two . twenty-two one . 
twenty-two two . Twenty-two 
three . twenty-two four . 
twenty-two three . twenty-two 
four . twenty-two five . 
twenty-two six . twenty-two 
five . 

Potter felt the see-saw battle 
through every nerve. The morula 
was down at the edge of the 
death range. It could live or it 
could die in the next few min- 
utes. Or it could come out of this 
crippled. Such things happened. 
When the flaw was too gross, the 
vat was turned off, flushed out. 
But Potter felt an identification 
with this embryo now. He felt he 
couldn’t afford to lose it. 

“Mutagen desensitizer,” he 
said. 

Svengaard hesitated. The 
Krebs cycle was following a slow 

34 



sine curve that dipped perilous- 
ly into the death cycle now. He 
knew why Potter had made this 
decision, but the carcinogenic 
peril of it had to be weighed. He 
wondered if he should argue the 
step. The embryo hung less than 
four points from a deadly plunge 
into dissolution. Chemical muta- 
gens administered at this point 
could shock it into a spurt of 
growth or destroy it. Even if the 
mutagen treatment worked, it 
could leave the embryo suscep- 
tible to cancer. 

“Mutagen desensitizer!” Pot- 
ter repeated. 

“Dosage?” Svengaard asked. 

“Half minim on fractional- 
minim feed. I’ll control it from 
here.” 

Svengaard shifted the feeder 
keys, his eyes on the Krebs-cycle 
repeater. He’d never heard of ap- 
plying such drastic treatment this 
close to the borderline. Mutagens 
usually were reserved for the 
partly-flawed Sterrie embryo, a 
move that sometimes produced 
dramatic results. It was like shak- 
ing a bucket of sand to level the 
grains. Sometimes the germ plasm 
presented with a mutagen sought 
a better level on its own. They’d 
even produced an occasional vi- 
able this way . but never an 
Optiman. 

Potter reduced amplification, 
studied the flow of movement in 
the embryo. Gently, he depressed 



GALAXY 



the feeder key, searched for Op- 
timan signs. The cellular action 
remained unsteady, partly blur- 
red. 

“Krebs cycle twenty-two 
eight,” the computer nurse said. 

Climbing a bjt, Potter thought. 

“Very slow,” Svengaard said. 

Potter maintained his vigil 
within the morula. It was grow- 
ing, expanding in fits and starts, 
fighting with all the enormous 
power concentrated in its tiny 
domain. 

“Krebs cycle thirty point four,” 
Svengaard said. 

“I am withdrawing mutagens,” 
Potter said. He backed off the 
microscope to a peripheral cell, 
desensitized the nucleo-proteins, 
searched for the flawed configur- 
ations. 

The cell was clean. 

■potter traced down into the 
coiled-coil helices of the 
DNA chains with a dawning won- 
der. 

“Krebs cycle thirty-six eight 
and climbing,” Svengaard said. 
“Shall I start the choline and 
aneurin?” 

Potter spoke automatically, his 
attention fixed on the cell’s gene 
structure. “Yes — start them.” 
He completed the scope tracing, 
shifted to another peripheral cell. 

Identical. 

Another cell — the same. 

The altered gene pattern held 



true, but it was a pattern. Potter 
realized, which hadn’t been seen 
in humankind since the second 
century of gene shaping. He 
thought of calling for a compari- 
son to be sure. The computer 
would have it, of course. No rec- 
ord was ever lost or thrown away. 
But he dared not . there was 
too much at stake in this. He 
knew he didn’t need the compari- 
son, though. This was a classic 
form, a classroom norm which he 
had stared at almost daily all 
through his medical education. 

The super-genius pattern that 
had caused Sven to call in a Cen- 
tral specialist was there, firmed 
up by the cuttingroom adjust- 
ments. It was close-coupled, 
though, with a fully stable fertili- 
ty pattern. The longevity basics 
lay locked in the configurations 
of the gene structure. 

If this embryo reached matur- 
ity and encountered a fertile 
mate, it could breed healthy, 
living children without the inter- 
ference of the gene surgeon. 

It needed no enzyme prescrip- 
tion to survive. It would outlive 
ten standard humans without that 
prescription . and with a few 
delicate enz5mic adjustments 
might join the ranks of the im- 
mortals. 

The Durant embryo could 
father a new race — like the 
live-forevers of Central, but dra- 
matically unlike them. This em- 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



35 



bryo’s progeny might fit them- 
selves into the rhythms of natural 
selectivity . completely outside 
Optiman control. 

It was the template pattern 
from which no human could devi- 
ate top far and live, yet it was 
the single thing feared most by 
Central. 

Every gene surgeon had this 
drummed into him during his 
education: Natural selectivity is 
a madness that sends its human 
victims groping blindly through 
empty lives.” 

Optiman reason and Optiman 
logic, must, of necessity, do the 
selecting. 

As though he straddled Time, 
Potter felt the profound certainty 
that the Durant embryo, if it 
matured, would encounter a fer- 
tile mate. This embryo had re- 
ceived a gift from outside — a 
wealth of sperm-arginine, the 
key to its fertility pattern. In the 
flood of mutagen which opened 
the active centers of the DNA, 
this embryo’s gene patterns had 
shaken down into a stable form 
no human dared attempt. 

Why did I introduce the muta- 
gens just then? Potter wondered. 
I knew it was the needed thing. 
How did I know? Could I have 
been an instrument of some other 
force? 

“Krebs cycle fifty-eight and 
climbing steadily,” Svengaard 
said. 



■potter longed for the freedom 
to discuss this problem with 
Svengaard . but there were the 
damnable parents and the Secur- 
ity people . watching Was 
it possible anyone else had seen 
enough and knew enough of this 
pattern to realize what had hap- 
pened here? he wondered. 

Why did I introduce the muta- 
gens? 

“Can you see the paLtern yet?” 
Svengaard asked. 

“Not yet,” Potter lied. 

The embryo was growing rap- 
idly now. Potter studied the pro- 
liferation of stable cells. It was 
beautiful. 

“Krebs cycle sixty-four seven,” 
Svengaard said. 

Vve waited too long, Potter 
thought. The higdomes of central 
will ask why I waited so long 
to kill this embryo. I cannot kill 
it! It’s too beautiful. 

Central maintained its power 
by keeping the world at large 
in ignorance of the ruling fist, 
by doling out living time in the 
form of precious enzyme pre- 
scriptions to its half-alive slaves. 

The Folk had a saying: In this 
world there are two worlds — one 
that works not and lives forever; 
one that lives not and works 
forever. 

Here in a crystal vat lay a tiny 
ball of cells, a living creature less 
than six-tenths of a millimeter in 
diameter, and it carried the full

potential of living out its life be- 
yond Central’s control. 

This morula had to die. 

They’ll order it killed, Potter 
thought. And I will be suspect, 
finished. And if this tbmg did gef 
loose in the world, what then? 
What would happen to ^ene sur- 
gery? Would we go back to cor- 
recting minor defects . the way 
it was before we started shaping 
supermen? 

Supermen! 

In his mind, he did what no 
voice could do: he cursed the 
Optimen. They were enormous 
power, instant life or death. Many 
were geniuses. But they were as 
dependent on the enzymic frac- 
tions as any clod of the Sterries 
or Breeders. There were men as 
brilliant among the Sterries and 
Breeders . and among the sur- 
geons. 

But none of these could live 
forever, secure in that ultimate, 
brutal power. 

“Krebs cycle one hundred 
even,” Svengaard said. 

“We’re over the top now,” Pot- 
ter said. He risked a glance at 
the computer nurse, but she had 
her back to him, fussing with 
her board. Without that compu- 
ter record, it might be possible to 
conceal what had happened 
here. With that record open to 
examination by Security and by 
the Optimen, it could not be 
hidden. Svengaard had not seen 



enough. The forehead lense only 
approximated the full field vision. 
The vat nurses couldn’t even 
guess at it. Only the computer 
nurse with her tiny monitor screen 
might know . and the full rec- 
ord lay in her machine now — a 
pattern of magnetic waves on 
strips of tape. 

VI 

tt^^hat’s the lowest I’ve ever 
-®- seen it go without killing 
the embryo,” Svengaard said. 
“How low?” Potter asked. 
“Twenty-one nine,” Svengaard 
said. “Twenty’s bottom, of course, 
but I’ve never heard of an em- 
bryo coming back from below 
twenty-five before, have you?” 
“No,” Potter said. 

“Is it the pattern we want?” 
Svengaard asked. 

“I don’t want to interfere too 
much yet,” Potter said. 

“Of course,” Svengaard said. 
“Whatever happens, it was in- 
spired surgery.” 

Inspired surgery! Potter 
thought. What would this dolt 
say if I told him what I have 
here? A totally viable embryo! 
A total. Kill it, he’d say. It’ll 
need no enzyme prescription 
and it Can breed true. It hasn’t 
a defect . not one. Kill it, he’d 
say. He’s a dutiful slave. The 
whole sorry history of gene shap- 
ing could be justified by this one

embryo. Bui the minute they see 
this tape at Central, the embryo 
will be destroyed. 

Eliminate it, they’ll say . 
because they don’t like to use 
words too close to kill or death. 

Potter bent to the scope. How 
lovely the embryo was in its own 
terrifying way. 

He risked another glance at the 
computer nurse. She turned, mask 
down, met his gaze, smiled. It 
was a knowing, secretive smile, 
the smile of a conspirator. Now 
she reached up to mop the per- 
spiration from her face. Her 
sleeve brushed a switch. A rasp- 
ing, whirring scream came from 
the computer board. She whirled 
to it, grated: “Oh, my God!” 
Her hands sped over the board, 
but tape continued to hiss 
through the transponder plates. 
She turned, tried to wrestle the 
transparent cover from the rec- 
ording console. The big reels 
whirled madly under the cover 
plate. 

“It’s running wild!” she shout- 
ed. 

“It’s locked on erase!” Sven- 
gaard yelled. He jumped to her 
side, tried to get the cover plate 
off. It jammed in its tracks. 

Potter watched like a man in 
a trance as the last of the tape 
flashed through the heads, began 
whipping on the take-up reels. 

“Oh, Doctor, we’ve lost it!” the 
computer nurse wailed. 



■potter focused on the little 
monitor screen at the com- 
puter nurse’s station. Did she 
watch the operation closely? he 
asked himself. Sometimes they 
follow the cut move by move 
. and computer nurses are a 
savvy lot. If she watched, she’ll 
have a good idea what we achiev- 
ed. At the very least, she’ll sus- 
pect. l^as that tape erasure real- 
ly *an accident? Do I dare? 

She turned, met his gaze. “Oh, 
Doctor, I’m so sorry,” she said. 

“It’s all right, nurse,” Potter 
said. “There’s nothing very speci- 
al about this embryo now — aside 
from the fact that it will live.” 

“We missed it, eh?” Svengaard 
asked. “Must’ve been the muta- 
gens.” 

“Yes,” Potter said. “But with- 
out them it would have died.” 

Potter stared at the nurse. He 
couldn’t be sure, but he thought 
he saw a profound relief wash 
over her features. 

“I’ll cut a verbal tape of the 
operation,” Potter said. “That 
should be enough on this em- 
bryo.” 

And he thought: When does a 
conspiracy begin? Was this such 
a beginning? 

There was still so much this 
conspiracy required. No knowl- 
edgeable eye could ever again 
look at this embryo through the 
microscope without being a part 
of the conspiracy ... or a traitor. 



38 



GALAXY 



“We still have the protein syn- 
thesis tape,” Svengaard said. 
“That’ll give us the chemical fac- 
tors by reference — and the tim- 
ing.” 

Potter thought about the pro- 
tein synthesis tape. Was there 
danger in it? No. It was only a 
reference for what had been used 
in the operation . not how 
anything had been used. 

“So it will,” Potter said. “So it 
will.” He gestured to the monitor 
screen. “Operations finished. You 
can cut the direct circuit and es- 
cort the parents to the reception 
room. I’m very sorry we achiev- 
ed no more than we did, but 
this’ll be a healthy human.” 

“Sterrie?” Svengaard asked. 

“To soon to guess,” Potter said. 
He looked at the computer nurse. 
She had managed to get the cover 
off at last and had stopped the 
tapes. “Any idea how that hap- 
pened?” 

“Probably solenoid failure,” 
Svengaard said. 

“This equipment’s quite old,” 
the nurse said. “I’ve asked for 
replacement units several times, 
but we don’t seem to be very high 
on the priority lists.” 

And there’s a natural reluc- 
tance at Central to admit any- 
thing can wear out, Potter 
thought. 

“Yes,” Potter said. “Well, I 
daresay you’ll get your replace- 
ments now.” 



Did anyone else see her trip 
that switch? Potter wondered. He 
tried to remember where every- 
one in the room had been look- 
ing, worried that a Security moni- 
tor might’ve been watching her. 
It Security saw that, she’s dead. 
Potter thought. And so am I. 

CC^'T^he technician’s report on 
repairs will have to be part 
of the record on this case,” 
Svengaard said. “I presume 
you’ll . .” 

“I’ll see to it personally, Doc- 
tor,” she said. 

Turning away. Potter had the 
impression that he and the com- 
puter nurse had just carried on a 
silent conversation. He noted that 
the big screen was now a gray 
blank, the Durants no longer 
watching. Should I see them my- 
self? he wondered. If they’re part 
of the Underground, they could 
help. Something has to be done 
about the embryo. Safest to ge^ 
it out of here entirely, but how? 

“I’ll take care of the tie-off de- 
tails,” Svengaard said. He began 
checking the vat seals and life 
systems repeaters, dismantling 
the meson generator. 

Someone has to see the par- 
ents, Potter thought. 

“The parents’ll be disappoint- 
ed,” Svengaard said. “They gen 
erally know why a specialist is 
called in . and probably got 
their hopes up.” 



HEISENBERG'S EYES

The door from the ready room 
opened to admit a man Potter 
recognized as an agent from Cen- 
tral Security. He was a moon- 
faced blond with features one 
tended to forget five minutes 
after leaving him. The man 
crossed the room to stand in 
front of Potter. 

Is this the end for me? Potter 
wondered. He forced his voice 
into a steady casual tone, asked: 
“What about the parents?” 
“They’re clean,” the agent said. 
“No tricky devices — conversa- 
tion normal — plenty of small 
talk, but normal.” 

“No hint of the other things?” 
Potter asked. “Anyway they 
could’ve penetrated Security 
without instruments?” 

“Impossible!” the man snorted. 
“Doctor Svengaard believes 
the father’s overly endowed with 
male protectiveness and the 
mother has too much matema- 
lism,” Potter said. 

“The records show you shaped 
’em,” the agent said. 

“It’s possible,” Potter said. 
“Sometimes you have to concen- 
trate on gross elements of the 
cut to save the embryo. Little 
things slip past.” 

“Anything slip past on this one 
today?” the agent asked. “I un- 
derstand the tape’s been erased 
. an accident.” 

Does he suspect? Potter asked 
himself. The extent of his own 



involvement and personal danger 
threatened to overwhelm Potter. 
It took the greatest effort to 
maintain a casual one. 

“Anything’s possible of course,” 
Potter said. He shrugged. “But 
I don’t think we have anything 
unusual here. We lost the Opti- 
shape in saving the embryo, but 
that happens. We can’t win them 
all.” 

“Should we flag the embryo’s 
record?” the agent asked. 

He’ll still fishing, Potter told 
himself. He said: “Suit yourself. 
I’ll have a verbal tape on the 
cut pretty soon — probably just 
as accurate as the visual one. You 
might wait and analyze that be- 
fore you decide.” 

“I’U do that,” the agent said. 

Ovengaard had the miscroscope 
off the vat now. Potter re- 
laxed slightly. No one was going 
to take a casual, dangerous look 
at the embryo. 

“I guess we brought you on a 
wild goose chase,” Potter said. 
“Sorry about that, but they did 
insist on watching.” 

“Better ten wild goose chases 
than one set of parents knowing 
too much,” the agent said. “How 
was the tape erased?” 

“Accident,” Potter said. “Worn 
equipment. We’ll have the tech- 
nical report for you shortly.” 
“Leave the worn equipment 
thing out of your report,” the 



40 



GALAXY 



agent said. “I’ll take that ver- 
bally. Allgood has to show every 
report to the Tuyere now.” 

Potter permitted himself an 
understanding nod. “Of course.” 
The men who worked out of Cen- 
tral knew about such things. One 
concealed personally disquieting 
items from the Optimen. 

The agent glanced around the 
cutting room, said: “Some day 
we won’t have to use all this 
secrecy. Won’t come any too soon 
for me.” He turned away. 

Potter watched the retreating 
back, thinking how neatly the 
agent fitted into the demands of 
his profession. A superb cut with 
just one flaw. Too neat a fit, too 
much cold logic, not enough im- 
aginative curiosity and readiness 
to explore the avenues of chance. 

If he’d pressed me, he’d have 
had me, Potter thought. He 
should’ve been more curious 
about the accident. But we tend 
to copy our masters — even in 
their blind spots. 

Potter began to have more 
confidence of success in his im- 
petuous venture. He turned back 
to help Svengaard with the final 
details, wondering : How do I 
know the agent’s satisfied with 
my explanation? No feeling of 
disquiet accompanied the ques- 
tion. I know he’s satisfied, but 
how do I know it? Potter asked 
himself. 

He realized then that his mind 



had been absorbing correlated 
gene information — the inner 
workings of the cells and their ex- 
terior manifestations — for so 
many years that this weight of 
data had fused into a new level 
of understanding. He was reading 
the tiny betrayals in gene-type 
reactions. 

1 can read people! 

It was a staggering realization. 
He looked around the room at 
the nurses helping with the tie- 
off. When his eyes found the 
computer nurse, he knew she had 
deliberately destroyed the record 
tape. He knew it. 

VII 

T izbeth and Harvey Durant 
walked hand in hand from 
the hospital after their interview 
with the Doctors Potter and 
Svengaard. They smiled and 
swung their clasped hands like 
children off on a picnic — which 
in a sense they were. 

The morning’s rain had been 
shut off and the clouds were be- 
ing packed off to the east, toward 
the tall peaks that looked down 
on Seatac megalopolis. The over- 
head sky showed a clear cerulean 
blue with a goblin sun riding high 
in it. 

A mob of people in loose 
marching order was coming 
through the park across the way, 
obviously the exercise period for 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



41 



some factory team or labor group. 
Their uniformed sameness was 
broken by flashes of color — 
an orange scarf on a woman’s 
head, a yellow sash across a 
man’s chest, the scarlet of a fer- 
tility fetish dangling on a gold 
loop from a woman’s ear. One 
man had equipped himself with 
bright green shoes. 

The pathetic attempts at in- 
dividuality in a world of 
gene-stamped sameness stabbed 
through Lizbeth’s defenses. She 
turned away lest the scene tear 
the smile from her lips, asked: 
“Where’ll we go?” 

“Hmmm?” Harvey held her 
back, waiting on the walk for 
the group to pass. 

Among the marchers, faces 
turned to stare enviously at Har- 
vey and Lizbeth. All knew why 
the Durants were here. The hos- 
pital, a great pile of plasmeld be- 
hind them, the fact that they 
were man and woman together, 
the casual dress, the smiles — 
all said the Durants were on 
breeder leave from their labors. 

Each individual in that mob 
hoped with a lost desperation for 
this same escape from the rou- 
tine that bound them all. Viable 
gametes, breeder leave — it was 
the universal dream. Even the 
known Sterries hoped, and so 
they patronized the breeder 
quacks and the manufacturers of 
doombah fetishes. 



They have no pasts, Lizbeth 
thought, focusing abruptly on the 
common observation of the Folk 
philosophers. They’re all people 
without pasts and only the hope 
for a future to cling to. Some- 
where our past was lost in an 
ocean of darkness. The Optimen 
and their gene surgeons have ex- 
tinguished our past. 

Even their own breeder leave 
lost its special glow in the face 
of this. The Durants might not 
be constrained to leap up at the 
rising bell and hurry apart to 
their labors, but they were still 
people without a past. And their 
future might be lost in an instant. 
The child being formed in the 
hospital vat ... in some small 
way it might still be part of 
them, but the surgeons had 
changed it. They had cut it off 
sharply from its past. 

T izbeth recalled her own par- 

' ents, the feeling of estrange- 
ment from them, of differences 
which went deeper than blood. 

They were only partly my par- 
ents, she thought. They knew it. 
And I knew it. 

She felt the beginnings of es- 
trangement from her own un- 
formed son then, an emotion 
that colored present necessities. 
Whafs the use? she wondered. 
But she knew what the use was 
— to end forever all this ampu- 
tation of pasts. 



42 



GALAXY 



The last envious face passed. 
The mob became moving backs, 
bits of color. They turned a cor- 
ner and were gone, cut off. 

Is it a corner we’ve turned and 
no coming back? Lizbeth won- 
dered. 

“Let’s walk to the cross-town 
shuttle tube,” Harvey said. 

“Through the park?” she asked. 

“Yes,” Harvey said. “Just 
think — ten months.” 

“And we can take our son 
home,” she said. “We’re very 
lucky.” 

“It seems like a long time — 
ten months,” Harvey said. 

Lizbeth answered as they 
crossed the street and entered 
the park. “Yes, but we can come 
see him every week when they 
shift him to the big vat — and 
that’s only three months away.” 

“You’re right,” Harvey said. 
“It’ll be over before we know 
it. And thank the powers he’s 
not a specialist or anything else. 
We can raise him at home. Our 
work time’ll be reduced.” 

“That Doctor Potter’s wonder- 
ful,” she said. 

As they talked, their clasped 
hands moved with the subtle 
pressures and finger shifts of the 
secret conversation — the No- 
Spoken-Word hand code that 
classified them as couriers of the 
Parents Underground. 

“They’re still watching us,” 
Harvey signaled. 



“I know.” 

“Svengaard is out — a slave of 
the power structure.” 

“Obviously. You know, I had 
no idea the computer nurse was 
one of us.” 

“You saw that, too?” 

“Potter v/as looking at her 
when she tripped the switch.” 
“Do you think the Security 
people saw her?” 

“Not a chance. They were all 
concentrated on us.” 

“Maybe she’s not one of us,” 
Harvey signaled. And he spoke 
aloud; “Isn’t it a beautiful day. 
Let’s take the floral path.” 

L izbeth’s finger pressures an- 
swered: “You think that 

nurse is an accidental?” 

“Could be. Perhaps she saw 
what Potter’d accomplished and 
knew there was only one way to 
save the embryo.” 

“Someone will have to contact 
her immediately then.” 

“Cautiously. She might be un- 
stable, emotional — a breeder 
neurotic.” 

“What about Potter?” 

“We’ll have to get people to 
him right away. We’ll need his 
help getting the embryo out of 
there.” 

“That’ll give us nine of Cen- 
tral’s surgeons,” she said. 

“If he goes along,” Harvey 
signaled. 

She looked at him with a smile 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



43 



that completely masked her sud- 
den worry. “You have doubts?” 
“It’s only that I think he was 
reading me at the same time I 
read him.” 

“Oh, he was,” she said. “But 
he was slow and lame about it 
compared to us.” 

“That’s how I read him. He 
was like a first reader, an ama- 
teur stumbling along, gaining 
confidence as he went.” 

“He’s untrained,” she said. 
“That’s obvious. I was worried 
you’d read something in him that 
escaped me.” 

“I guess you’re right.” 

Across the park, dust had 
shattered the sunlight into count- 
less pillars that stood up through 
an arboretum. Lizbeth stared at 
the scene as she answered: “No 
doubt of it, darling. He’s a na- 
tural, someone who’s stumbled 
onto the talent accidentally. They 
do occur, you know — have to. 
Nothing can keep us from com- 
municating.” 

“But they certainly try.” 
“Yes,” she signaled. “They 
were very intent on it there to- 
day — probing and scanning us 
in that lounge. But people who 
think mechanically will never 
guess — I mean that our wea- 
pons are people and not things.” 
“It’s their fatal blind spot,” he 
agreed. “Central’s carved out the 
genetic ruts with logic — and 
logic keeps digging the ruts deep- 



er and deeper. They’re so deep 
now they can’t see over the edges 
to the outside.” 

“And that wide-wide universe 
out there calling to us,” she sig- 
naled. 

VIII 

A yTax Allgood, Central’s chief 
of Tachy-Security, climbed 
Administration’s plasmeld steps 
slightly ahead of his two surgeon 
companions as befitted the direc- 
tor of the Optimen’s swift and 
terrible hand of power. 

The morning sun behind the 
trio sent their shadows darting 
across the white building’s angles 
and planes. 

They were admitted to the sil- 
ver shadows of the entrance por- 
tico where a barrier dropped for 
the inevitable delay. Quarantine 
scanners searched and probed 
them for inimical microbes. 

Allgood turned with the pati- 
ence of long experience in this 
procedure, studied his compan- 
ions — Boumour and Igan. It 
amused him that they must drop 
their titles here. 

No doctors were admitted to 
these precincts. Here they must 
be pharmacists. The title doctor 
carried overtones which spread 
unrest among the Optimen. They 
knew about doctors, but only as 
ministers to the mere humans. A 
doctor became a euphemism in 



44 



GALAXY 




here, just as no one said death 
or kill or implied a machine or 
structure could wear out. Only 
new Optimen in their acolyte ap- 
prenticeship, or meres of young 
appearance served in Central, al- 
though some of the meres had 
been preserved by their masters 
for remarkable lengths of time. 

Boumour and Igan both passed 
the test of youthfulness, although 
Boumour’s face was of tiiat 
pinched-up elfin type which 
tended to suggest age before its 
time. He was a big man with 
heavy shoulders, powerful. Igan 
looked lean and fragile beside 
him, a beaked face with long jaw 
and tight little mouth. The eyes 
of both men were Optiman color 
— blue and penetrating. They 
were probably near-Opts, both 
of them. Most Central surgeon- 
nharmacists were. 

The pair moved restlessly un- 
der Allgood’s gaze, avoiding his 
eyes. Boumour began talking in 
a low voice to Igan with one 
hand on the man’s shoulder 
moving nervously, kneading. The 
movement of Boumour’s hand 
on Igan’s shoulder carried an 
odd familiarity, a suggestion to 
Allgood that he had seen some- 
thing like this somewhere before. 
He couldn’t place where. 

The quarantine probing-scan- 
ning continued. It seemed to All- 
good that it was lasting longer 
than usual. He turned his atten- 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



4S 



tion to the scene across from the 
building. It was strangely peace- 
ful, at odds with the mood of 
Central as Allgood knew it. 

Allgood realized that his access 
to secret records and even to old 
books gave him an uncommon 
knowledge about Central. The 
Optiman demesne reached across 
leagues of what had once been 
the political entities of Canada 
and northern United States. It 
occupied a rough circle some 
seven hundred kilometers in dia- 
meter and with two hundred 
levels below ground. It was a 
region of multitudinous controls 
— weather control, gene control, 
bacterial control, enzyme con- 
trol. Human control. 

I n this little corner, the heart 
of Administration, the ground 
had been shaped into an Italian 
chiaroscuro landscape — blacks 
and grays with touches of pas- 
tels. The Optimen were people 
who could barber a mountain at 
a whim: A little off the top and 
leave the sideburns. Throughout 
Central, nature had been smooth- 
ed over, robbed of her dangerous 
sharpness. Even when the Opti- 
men staged some natural display, 
it lacked an element of drama 
which was a general lack in their 
lives. 

Allgood often wondered at this. 
He had seen pre-Optiman films 
and recognized the differences. 



Central’s manicured niceties 
seemed to him all tied up with 
the omnipresented triangles in- 
dicating pharmacy outlets where 
the Optimen might check their 
enzyme prescriptions. 

“Are they taking a long time 
about it or is it just me?” Bou- 
mour asked. His voice carried a 
rumbling quality. 

“Patience,” Igan said. A mel- 
low tenor there. 

“Yes,” Allgood said. “Patience 
is a man’s best ally.” 

Boumour looked up at the Se- 
curity chief, studying, wondering. 
Allgood seldom spoke except for 
effect. He, not the Optimen, was 
the conspiracy’s greatest threat. 
He was body and soul with his 
masters, a super puppet. Why 
did he order us to accompany 
him today? Boumour wondered. 
Does he know? Will he denounce 
us? 

There was a special ugliness 
about Allgood that fascinated 
Boumour. The Security chief 
was a stocky little Folk mere 
with moon face and darting al- 
mond eyes, a dark bush of hair 
low on his forehead — a Shang- 
cut by the look of his overt gene 
markers. 

Allgood turned toward the 
quarantine barrier, and with a 
sudden feeling of awakening 
Boumour realized the man’s ugli- 
ness came from within. It was the 
ugliness of fear, of created fear 



46 



GALAXY 



and personal fear. The realization 
gave Boumour an abrupt sensa- 
tion of relief which he signaled 
to Igan through finger pressures 
on the man’s shoulder. 

Igan pulled away suddenly to 
stare out away from the build- 
ing where they stood. Of course 
Max Allgood fears, he thought. 
He lives in a mire of fears, named 
and nameless, just as the Opti- 
men do. Poor creatures. 

The scene across from Central 
began to impress itself on Igan’s 
senses. Here, at this moment, it 
was a day of absolute Spring, 
planned that way in the lordly 
heart of Weather Control. Ad- 
ministration’s steps looked down 
on a lake, round and perfect like 
an enameled blue plate. On a 
low hill beyond the lake, plas- 
meld plinths stood out like white 
stones: elevator caps reaching 

down into the locked fastness of 
the Optiman quarters below — 
two hundred levels. 

Far beyond the hill, the .sky 
began to turn dark blue and oily. 
It was streaked suddenly with 
red, green and purple fires in a 
rather flat pattern. Presently, 
there came a low clap of con- 
tained thunder. Across the reach- 
es of Central, some Upper Opti- 
man was staging a tame storm 
for entertainment. 

'"T^he storm was the first thing 
Allgood had seen this day 



to fit his interpretation of Cen- 
tral’s inner rhythms. Things of 
an ominous nature set the pat- 
tern for his view of Central. Peo- 
ple vanished into here never to 
be seen again and only he. All- 
good, the chief of Tachy-Securi- 
ty, or a few trusted agents knew 
their fate. Allgood felt the thun- 
derclap keyed to his mood, a 
sound that portended absolute 
power. Under the storm sky now 
turning acid yellow and dispers- 
ing the air of Spring, the plinths 
on the hill above the lake became 
pagan cenotaphs set out against 
a ground as purple-green as cam- 
omile. 

“It’s time,” Boumour said. 

Allgood turned to find the 
quarantine barrier lifted. He led 
the way into the Hall of Counsel 
with its shimmering adamantine 
walls above ranks of empty plas- 
meld benches. The trio moved 
through tongues of perfumed 
vapor that swayed aside as they 
breasted them. 

Optiman acolytes wearing 
green canes fastened at the shoul- 
ders with diamond lanulas came 
from side shadows to pace them. 
Worked into the green of their 
robes were shepherd’s pipes of 
platinum and they swung golden 
thuribles that wafted clouds of 
antiseptic pink smoke into the 
air. 

Allgood kept his attention on 
the end of the hall. A giant globe 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



47 



as red as a mandrake stem hung 
in walking beams there. It was 
some forty meters in diameter, 
v/ith a section folded back like a 
segment cut from an orange to 
reveal the interior. This was the 
Tuyere’s control center, the tool 
of strange powers and senses with 
which they watched and ruled 
their minions. Lights flashed in 
there, phosphor greens and the 
blue cracklings of arcs. Great 
round gauges spelled out mes- 
sages and red lights winked re- 
sponse. Numbers flowed on 
beams through the air and eso- 
teric symbols danced on ribbons 
of light. 

Up through the middle like the 
core of the fruit stretched a white 
columni supporting a triangular 
platform at the globe’s center. 
At the points of the triangle, each 
in a golden plasmeld throne, sat 
the Optiman trio known as the 
Tuyere — friends, companions, 
elected rulers for this cenbary 
and with seventy-eight years yet 
to serve. 

It was a wink of time in their 
lives. An annoyance. Often a dis- 
quieting one because they must 
face realities which all other Op- 
rimen could treat as euphemisms. 

The acolytes stopped some 
twenty paces from the red globe, 
but continued swinging their 
thuribles. Allgood moved one 
pace ahead, motioned Boumour 
and Igan to halt behind him. The 



Security chief felt he knew just 
how far he could go here, that 
he must go to the limits. They 
need me, he told himself. But 
he held no illusions about the 
dangers in this interview. 

Allgood looked up into the 
globe. A dancing lace of power 
placed a deceptive transparency 
over the interior. Through that 
curtain could be seen shapes, out- 
lines — now clear, now enfolded. 

“I came,” Allgood said. 

Boumour and Igan echoed the 
greeting, reminding themselves 
of all the protocol and forms 
which must be observed here. 
Always use the tiame of the Opti- 
man you address. If you do not 
know the name, ask it humbly. 

Allgood waited for the Tuyere 
to answer. Sometimes he felt they 
had no sense of time, at least of 
seconds and minutes and perhaps 
not even of days. It might be 
true. People of infinite lives 
might notice the passing seasons 
as clock ticks.

'"T^he throne support turned, 
presenting the Tuyere one 
by one. They sat in clinging 
transluscent robes, almost nude, 
flaunting their similarity to the 
meres. Facing the open segment 
now was Nourse, a Greek god 
figure with blocky face, heavy 
brows, a chest ridged by muscles

GALAXY 



that rippled as he breathed. How 
evenly he breathed! With what 
controlled slowness! 

The base turned, presented 
Schruille, the bone slender, un- 
predictable one with great round 
eyes, high cheeks and a flat nose 
above a mouth which seemed al- 
ways pulled into a thin line of 
disapproval. Here was a danger- 
ous one. Some said he spoke of 
things which other Optimen 
could not. In Allgood’s presence, 
Schruille had pnce said “death,” 
although referring to a butterfly. 

Again, the base turned — and 
here was Calapine, her robe gir- 
dled with crystal plastrons. She 
was a thin, high-breasted woman 
with golden brown hair and chill, 
insolent eyes, full lips and a long 
nose above a pointed chin. All- 
good had caught her watching 
him strangely on occasion. At 
such times he tried not to think 
about the Optimen who took 
mere playmates. 

Nourse spoke to Calapine, 
looking at her thi’ough the pris- 
matic reflector which each throne 
raised at a shoulder. She answer- 
ed, but the voices did not carry 
to the floor of the hall. 

Allgood watched the interplay 
for a clue to their mood. It was 
known among the Folk that 
Nourse and Calapine had been 
bedmates for periods that 
spanned hundreds of mere life- 
times. Nourse had a reputation 



of strength and predictability, 
but Calapine was known as a 
wild one. Mention her name and 
likely someone would look up 
and ask : “What’s she done now?” 
It was always said with a touch 
of admiration and fear. Allgood 
knew that fear. He had worked 
for other ruling trios, but none 
who had his measure as did 
these three . especially Cala- 
pine. 

The throne base stopped with 
Nourse facing the open segment. 
“You came,” he rumbled. “Of 
course you came. The ox knows 
its owner and the ass its master’s 
crib.” 

So it’s ^oin^ to be one of those 
days, Allgood thought. Ridicule! 
It could only mean they knevir 
how we had stumbled . but 
didn’t they always? 

Calapine swiveled her throne 
to look down at the meres. The 
Hall of Counsel had been pat- 
terned on the Roman Senate 
with false columns around the 
edges, banks of benches beneath 
glittering scanner eyes. Every- 
thing focused down onto the fig- 
ures standing apart from the 
acolytes. 

Looking up, Igan reminded 
himself he had feared and hated 
these creatures all his life — 
even while he pitied them. How 
lucky he’d been to miss the Opti- 
man cut. It’d been close, but he’d 
been saved. He could remember 



HEISENBERG'S EYES

the hate of his childhood, before 
it had become tempered by pity. 
It’d been a clean thing then, 
sharp and real, blazing against 
the Givers of Time. 

came as requested to 
’ ^report on the Durants,” 
Allgood said. 

He took two deep breaths to 
calm his nerves. These sessions 
were always dangerous, but 
doubly so since he’d decided on 
a double game. There was no 
turning back, though, and no 
wish to since he’d discovered the 
doppelgangers of himself they 
were growing. There could be 
only one reason they’d duplicate 
him. Well, they’d learn. 

Calapine studied Allgood, won- 
dering if it might be time to seek 
diversion with the ugly Folk 
male. Perhaps here was an an- 
swer to boredom. Both Schruille 
and Nourse indulged. She seemed 
to recall having done that before 
with another Max, but couldn’t 
remember if it had helped her 
boredom. 

“Say what it is we give you, 
little Max,” she said. 

Her woman’s voice, soft and 
with laughter behind it, terrified 
him. Allgood swallowed. “You 
give life, Calapine.” 

“Say how many lovely years 
you have,” she ordered. 

Allgood found his throat con- 
tained no moisture. “Almost 

50 



four hundred, Calapine,” he rasp- 
ed. 

Nourse chuckled. “Ahead of 
you stretch many more lovely 
years if you serve us well,” he 
said. 

It was the closest to a direct 
threat Allgood had ever heard 
from an Optiman. They worked 
their wills by indirection, by eu- 
phamist subtlety. They worked 
through meres who could face 
such concepts as death and kill- 
ing. 

Who have they shaped to des- 
troy me? Allgood wondered. 

“Many little tick-tock years,” 
Calapine said. 

“Enough!” Schruille growled. 
He detested these interviews 
with the underclasses, the way 
Calapine baited ’ the Folk. He 
swiveled his throne and now all 
the Tuyere faced the open seg- 
ment. Schruille looked at his 
fingers, the ever youthful skin, 
and wondered why he had 
snapped that way. An enzymic 
imbalance? The thought touch- 
ed him with disquiet. He general- 
ly held his silence during these 
sessions — as a defense because 
he tended to get sentimental 
about the pitiful meres and des- 
pise himself for it afterward. 

Boumour moved up beside All- 
good, said: “Does the Tuyere 
wish now the report on the Dur- 
ants?” 

Allgood stifled a feeling of 

GALAXY 



rage at the interruption. Didn’t 
the fool know that the Optimen 
must always appear to lead the 
interview? 

“The words and images of your 
report have been seen, analyzed 
and put away,” Nourse rumbled. 
“Now it is the non-report that we 
wish.” 

Non-report? Allgood asked 
himself. Does he think we’ve 
hidden something? 

“Little Max,” Calapine said. 
“Have you bowed to our neces- 
sity and questioned the compu- 
ter nurse under narcosis?” 

Here it comes. Allgood thought. 
He took a deep breath, said : “She 
has been questioned, Calapine.” 

Igan took his place beside Bou- 
mour, said: “There’s something 
I wish to say about that if I . 

“Hold your tongue, pharma- 
cist,” Nourse said. “We talk to 
Max.” 

1fgan bowed his head, thought: 

How dangerous this is! And 
all because of that fool nurse. 
She w*asn't even one of us. No 
cyborg-of-the-register knows her. 
A member of no cell or platoon. 
An accidental, a Sterrie, and she 
puts us in this terrible peril! 

Allgood saw that Igan’s hands 
trembled, wondered: What’s driv- 
ing these surgeons? They can’t 
be such fools. 

“Was it not a deliberate thing 
the nurse did?” Calapine asked. 



“Yes, Calapine,” Allgood said. 
“Your agents did not see it, 
yet we knew it had to be,” Cala- 
pine said. She turned to scan the 
instruments of the control center, 
returned her attention to Allgood. 
“Say now why this was.” 
Allgood sighed. “I have no ex- 
cuses, Calapine. The men have 
been censured.” 

“Say now why the nurse acted 
thus,” Calapine ordered. 

Allgood wet his lips with his 
tongue, glanced at Boumour and 
Igan. They looked at the floor. 
He looked back to Calapine, at 
her face shimmering within the 
globe. “We were unable to dis- 
cover her motives, Calapine.” 
“Unable?” Nourse demanded. 
“She . ahh . ceased to ex- 
ist during the interrogation, 
Nourse,” Allgood said. As the 
Tuyere stiffened, sitting bolt up- 
right in their thrones, he added: 
“A flaw in her genetic cutting, so 
the pharmacists tell me.” 

“A profound pity,” Nourse 
said, settling back. 

Igan looked up, blurted: “It 
could’ve been a deliberate self- 
erasure, Nourse.” 

That damn fool! Allgood 
thought. 

But Nourse stared now at Igan. 
“You were present, Igan?” 
“Boumour and I administered 
the narcotics.” 

And she died, Igan thought. 
But we did not kill her. She died 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



51 



and we’ll be blamed for it. Where 
could she have learned the trick 
oi stopping her own heart? Only 
Cyborgs are supposed to know 
and teach it, 

“Deliberate . self-erasure?” 
Nourse asked. Even when seen 
indirectly, the idea held terrify- 
ing implications. 

“Max!” Calapine said. “Say 
now if you used excessive . 
cruelty.” She leaned forward, 
wondering why she wanted him 
to admit barbarity. 

“She suffered nothing, Cala- 
pine,” Allgood said. 

alapine sat back disappointed. 

Could he be lying? She read 
her instruments; Calmness. He 
wasn’t lying. 

“Pharmacist,” Nourse said. 
“Explain your opinion.” 

“We examined her carefully,” 
Igan said. “It couldn’t have been 
the narcotics. There’s no way. .” 

“Some of us think it was a 
genetic flaw,” Boumour said. 

“There’s disagreement,” Igan 
said. He glanced at Allgood, feel- 
ing the man’s disapproval. It had 
to be done, though. The Optimen 
must be made to know disquiet. 
When they could be tricked into 
acting emotionally, they made 
mistakes. The plan called for 
them to make mistakes now. 
They must be put off balance — 
subtly, delicately. 

“Your opinion. Max?” Nourse 

52 



asked. He watched carefully. 
They’d been getting poorer mo- 
dels lately, doppelganger degen- 
eration. 

“We’ve already taken cellular 
matter, Nourse,” AUgood said, 
“and are growing a duplicate. If 
we get a true copy, we’ll check 
the question of genetic flaw.” 

“It is a pity the doppelganger 
won’t have the original’s memo- 
ries,” Nourse said. 

“Pity of pities,” Calapine said. 
She looked at Schruille. “Is this 
not true, Schruille?” 

Schruille looked up at her v/ith- 
out answering. Did she think she 
could bait him the way she did 
the meres? 

“This woman had a mate?” 
Nourse asked. 

“Yes, Nourse,” Allgood said. 

“Fertile union?” 

“No, Nourse,” Allgood said. 
“A Sterrie.” 

“Compensate the mat e,” 
Nourse said. “Another woman, a 
bit of leisure. Let him think she 
was loyal to us.” 

Allgood nodded, said: “We are 
giving him a woman, Nourse, who 
will keep him under constant sur- 
veillance.” 

A trill of laughter escaped 
Calapine. “Why has no one men- 
tioned this Potter, the genetic en- 
gineer?” she asked. 

“I was coming to him, Cala- 
pine,” Allgood said. 

“Has anyone examined the em- 

GALAXY 



bryo?” Schruille asked, looking 
up suddenly. 

“No, Schruille,” Allgood said. 

“Why not?” 

“If this is a concerted action 
to escape genetic controls, 
Schruille, we don’t want members 
of the organization to know we 
suspect them. Not yet. First, we 
must learn all about these peo- 
ple — the Durants, their friends. 
Potter . everyone.” 

“But the embryo’s the key to 
the entire thing,” Schruille said. 
“What was done to it? What is 
it?” 

“It is bait, Schruille,” Allgood 
said. 

“Bait?” 

“Yes, Schruille, to catch who- 
ever else may be involved.” 

“But what was done to it?” 

“How can that matter, Schruil- 
le, as long as we can ... as long 
as we have complete control over 
it.” 

“The embryo is being guarded 
most adroitly, I hope,” Nourse 
said. 

“Most adroitly, Nourse.” 

“Send the pharmacist Sven- 
gaard to us,” Calapine ordered. 

“Svengaard . Calapine?” 
Allgood asked. 

“You need not know why,” she 
said. “Merely send him.” 

“Yes, Calapine.” 

Ohe stood up to signify the end 
^ of the interview. The acolytes 



turned around, still swinging 
their thuribles, prepared now to 
escort the meres from the hall. 
But Calapine was not finished. 
She stared at Allgood, said: 
“Look at me. Max.” 

He looked, recognizing that 
strange, studying set to her eyes. 

“Am I not beautiful?” she 
asked. 

Allgood stared at her, the slen- 
der figure with its outlines soft- 
ened by the robe and curtains 
of power within the globe. She 
was beautiful as were many Op- 
timan females. But the beauty 
repelled him with its threatening 
perfection. She would live inde- 
finitely, already had lived forty 
or fifty thousand years. But one 
day his lesser flesh would reject 
the medical replacements and 
the enzyme prescriptions. He 
would die while she went on. 

His lesser flesh rejected her. 

“You are beautiful, Calapine,” 
he said. 

“Your eyes never admit it,” 
she said. 

“What do you. Cal?” Nourse 
asked. “Do you want this ... do 
you want Max?” 

“I want his eyes,” she said. 
“Just his eyes.” 

Nourse looked at Allgood, said : 
“Women.” His voice held a note 
of false cameradderie. 

Allgood stood astonished. He 
had never heard that tone from 
an Optiman before. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



53 



“I make a point,” Calapine 
said. “Don’t interrupt my words 
with male jokes. In your heart of 
hearts. Max, how do you feel 
about me?” 

“Ahhhh,” Nourse said. He nod- 
ded. 

“I shall say it for you,” she 
said as Allgood remained mute. 
“You worship me. Never forget 
that. Max. You worship me.” She 
looked at Boumour and Igan, 
dismissed them with a wave of 
her hand. 

Max Allgood lowered his eyes, 
feeling the truth in her words. He 
turned, and with the ecolytes 
flanking them, proceeded to lead 
Igan and Boumour out of the 
hall. 

As they emerged onto the 
steps, the acolytes held back and 
the barrier dropped. Igan and 
Boumour turned left, noting a 
new building at the end of the 
long esplanade which fronted 
Administration. They saw its 
machicolated walls, the openings 
fitted with colored filters which 
sent bursts of red, blue and green 
light upon the surrounding air, 
and they recognized that it block- 
ed the way they had intended to 
take out of Central. A building 
suddenly erected, another Opti- 
man toy. They saw it and plan- 
ned their steps accordingly with 
the automatic acceptance that 
marked them as regulars in the 
Optiman demesne. The meres and 



inhabitants of Central seemed to 
know their way through the ara- 
besques of its roads and streets 
by an instinct. The place defied 
cartographers because the Opti- 
men were too subject to change 
and whim. 

“Igan!” 

It was Allgood calling from be- 
hind them. 

They turned, stood still, wait- 
ing for him to catch up with 
them. 

Allgood planted himself in 
front of them, hands on hips, 
said: “TeU me, do you worship 
her, too?” 

“Don’t speak foolishness,” 
Boumour said. 

“No,” Allgood said. His eyes 
appeared to be sunk in pockets 
above the high cheekbones. “I 
belong to no Folk cult, no breed- 
er congregation. How can I wor- 
ship her?” 

“But you do,” Igan said. 

“Yes!” 

“They are the real religion of 
our world,” Igan said. “You do 
not have to belong to a cult or 
carry a talisman to know this. 
Calapine merely told you that, if 
there is a conspiracy, those be- 
longing to it are heretics.” 

“Is that what she meant?” 

“Of course.” 

“And she must know what is 
done to heretics,” Allgood said. 

“Without a doubt,” Boumer 
said.

GALAXY 



X 

Qvengaard had seen this build- 
ing in the tri-casts and enter- 
tainment vids. He’d heard des- 
criptions of the Hall of Counsel — 
but actually to be standing here 
at the quarantine wall with the 
copper sheen of sunset over the 
hills across from it . he’d never 
dreamed this could occur. 

Elevator caps stood out like 
plasmeld warts on the hillcock in 
front of him. There were other 
low hills beyond with piled build- 
ings on them that could have 
been mistaken for rock outcrop- 
pings. 

A lone woman passed him on 
the esplanade, pulling a ground- 
effect cart filled with oddly 
shaped bundles. Svengaard found 
himself worried about what the 
bundles might contain, but he 
knew he dared not ask or show 
undue curiosity. 

The red triangle of a phar- 
macy outlet glowed on a pillar 
beside him. He passed it, glanced 
back at his escort. 

He had come halfway across 
the continent in the tube with 
an entire car to himself except 
for the escort, an agent from T- 
Security. Deep into Central 
they’d come, the gray-suited T- 
Security agent always beside him. 

Svengaard began climbing the 
steps. 

Already Central was beginning 



to weigh on him. There was a 
sense of something disastrous 
about the place. Even though 
he suspected the source of the 
feeling, he couldn’t shake it off. 
It was all the Folk nonsense you 
could never quite evade, he’d de- 
cided. The Folk were a people 
for the most part without legends 
or ancient myths except where 
such matters touched the Opti- 
men. In the Folk memories. Cen- 
tral and the Optimen were fixed 
with sinister omens compounded 
of awesome fear and adulation. 

Why did they summon me? 
Svengaard asked himself. The 
escort refused to say. 

They were stopped by the wall 
and waited now, silent, nervous. 

Even the agent was nervous, 
Svengaard saw. 

Why did they summon me? 
The agent cleared his thread: 
“Have all the protocol straight?” 
“I think so,” Svengaard said. 
“Once you get into the hall, 
keep pace with the acolytes 
who’ll escort you from there. 
You’ll be interviewed by the 
Tuyere — Nourse, Shruille and 
Calapine. Remember to use their 
names when you address them 
individually. Use no such words 
as death or kill or die. Avoid the 
very concepts if you can. Let 
them lead the interview. Best not 
to volunteer anything.” 

Svengaard took a trembling 
breath. 



56 



GAbOCY 



Have they brought me here to 
advance me? he wondered. That 
must be it. I’ve served my ap- 
prenticeship under such men 'as 
Potter and Igan. I’m being pro- 
moted to Central. 

“And don’t say doctor,” the 
escort said. “Doctors are phar- 
macists or genetic engineers.” 

“I understand,” Svengaard 
said. 

“Allgood wants a complete re- 
port on the interview afterward,” 
the agent said. 

“Yes, of course,” Svengaard 
said. 

The quarantine barrier lifted. 

“In you go,” the agent said. 

“You’re not coming with me?” 
Svengaard asked. 

“Not invited,” the agent said. 
He turned, went down the steps. 

Ovengaard swallowed, entered 
^ the silver gloom of the por- 
tico, stepped through to find 
himself in the long hall with an 
escort of six acolytes, three to a 
side, swinging thuribles from 
which pink smoke wafted. He 
smelled the antiseptics in the 
smoke. 

The big red globe at the end 
of the hall dominated the place. 
Its open segment showing flash- 
ing and winking lights, with mov- 
ing shapes inside, fascinated 
Svengaard. 

The acolsrtes stopped him 
twenty paces from the opening 



and he looked up at the Tuyere, 
recognizing them through the 
power curtains — Nourse in the 
center flanked by Calapine at 
left and Schruille. 

“I came,” Svengaard said, 
mouthing the greeting the agent 
had told him to use. He rubbed 
sweaty palms against his best 
tunic. 

Nourse spoke with a rumbling 
voice: “You are the genetic en- 
gineer, Svengaard.” 

“Thei Svengaard, yes . 
Nourse.” He took a deep breath, 
wondering if they’d caught the 
hesitation while he remembered 
to use the Optiman’s name. 

Nourse smiled. 

“You assisted recently in the 
genetic alteration of an embryo 
from a couple named Durant,” 
Nourse said. “The chief engineer 
at the cutting was Potter.” 

“Yes, I was the assistant, 
Nourse.” 

“There was an accident during 
this operation,” Calapine said. 

There was a strange musical 
quality in her voice, and Sven- 
gaard recognized she hadn’t 
asked a question, but had re- 
minded him of a detail to which 
she wanted him to give his atten- 
tion. He felt the beginnings of a 
profound disquiet. 

“An accident, yes . Cala- 
pine,” he said. 

“You followed the operation 
closely?” Nourse asked. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



57 



“Yes, Nourse.” And Svengaard 
found his attention swinging to 
Schruille, v/ho sat there brood- 
ing and silent. 

“Now then,” Calapine said, 
“you will be able to tell us what 
it is Potter has concealed about 
this genetic alteration.” 

Svengaard found that he had 
lost his voice. He could only 
shake his head. 

“He concealed nothing?” 
Nourse asked. “Is that what you 
say?” 

Svengaard nodded. 

“We mean you no harm, Thei 
Svengaard,” Calapine said. “You 
may speak.” 

Svengaard swallowed, cleared 
his throat. “I . .” he said. “. 
the question ... I saw nothing 
. concealed.” He fell silent, 
then remebered he was supposed 
to use her name and said : “Cala- 
pine,” just as Nourse started to 
speak. Nourse broke off, scowled. 

Calapine giggled. 

Nourse said: “Yet you tell us 
you followed the genetic alter- 
ation.” 

“I . wasn’t on the micro- 
scope with him every second,” 
Svengaard said. “Nourse. I . 
uh . the duties of the assistant 
— instructions to the computer 
nurse, keying the feeder tapes 
and so on.” 

“Say now if the computer 
nurse was a special friend of 
yours,” Calapine ordered. 



“I . she’d . Svengaard 
wet his lips with his tongue. What 
do they want? “We’d worked to- 
gether for a number of years, 
Calapine. I can’t say she was a 
friend. We worked together.” 

“Did you examine the embryo 
after the operation?” Nourse 
asked. 

Qchruille sat up, stared at Sven- 
^ gaard. 

“No, Nourse,” Svengaard said. 
“My duties were to secure the 
vat, check life-support systems.” 
He took a deep breath. Perhaps 
they were, only testing him after 
all. But such odd questions! 

“Say now if Potter is a special 
friend,” Calapine ordered. 

“He was one of my teachers, 
Calapine someone I’ve worked 
with on delicate genetic prob- 
lems.” 

“But not in your particular 
circle,” Nourse said. 

Svengaard shook his head. 
Again he sensed menace. 

He didn’t know what to expect. 
Perhaps the great globe would 
roll over, crush him, reduce his 
body to scattered atoms. But no 
— the Optimen couldn’t do that. 
He studied the three faces as 
they becam eclear through the 
power curtains, seeking a sign. 
Clean, sterile faces. He could see 
the genetic markers in their fea- 
tures — they might be any Ster- 
ries of the Folk except for the

Optiman aura of mystery. Folk 
rumor said they were sterile by 
choice, that they saw breeding as 
the beginning of death; but the 
genetic clues of their features 
spoke otherwise to Svengaard. 

“Why did you call Potter on 
this particular problem?” Nourse 
asked. 

Svengaard took a tight, quav- 
ering breath, said: “He . the 
embryo’s genetic configuration 
. near-Opt. Potter is familiar 
with our hospital. He ... I have 
confidence in him; brilliant sur 
. genetic engineer.” 

“Say now if you are friendly 
with any other of our pharma- 
cists,” Calapine said. 

“I work with them when they 
come to our facility,” Svengaard 
said. 

“Calapine,” Nourse supplied. 

A trill of laughter shook her. 

A dark flush spread up from 
Svengaard’s collar. He began to 
feel angry. What kind of test was 
this? Couldn’t they do anything 
but sit there, mocking, question- 
ing? 

Anger gave Svengaard com- 
mand of his voice and he said; 
“I’m only head of genetic en- 
gineering at one facility, Nourse 
— a lowly district engineer. I 
handle routine cuttings. When 
something requires a specialist, 
I follow orders and call a special- 
ist. Potter was the indicated spec- 
ialist for this case.” 



“One of the specialists,” 
Nourse said. 

“One I know and respect,” 
Svengaard said. This time he 
didn’t bother adding the Opti- 
man’s name. 

“Say now if you are angry,” 
Calapine ordered, and there was 
that musical quality in her voice. 

“I’m angry.” 

“Say why.” 

“Why am I here?” Svengaard 
asked. “What kind of interroga- 
tion is this? Have I done some- 
thing wrong? Am I to be cen- 
sured?” 

Nourse bent forward and 
placed his hands on his knees. 
“You dare question us?” 

Svengaard stared at the Opti- 
man. In spite of the tone of the 
question, the square, heavy- 
boned face appeared reassuring, 
calming. “I’ll do anything I can 
to help you,” Svengaard said. 
“Anything. But how can I help 
or answer you when I don’t know 
what you v/ant?” 

Calapine started to speak, but 
stopoed when Nourse raised his 
hand. 

“Our most profound wish that 
we could tell you,” Nourse said. 
“But surely you know we can 
have no true discourse. How 
could you understand what we 
understand? Can a wooden bowl 
contain sulphuric acid- You must 
trust us. We seek what is best 
for you.”

\ sense of warmth and grati- 
tude permeated Sv.engaard. 
Of course he trusted them. They 
were the genetic apex of human- 
kind. And he reminded himself: 
They are the power that loves us 
and cares for us. 

Svengaard sighed. “What do 
you wish of me?” 

“You have answered all our 
questions,” Nourse said. “Even 
our non-questions are answered.” 
“Now, you will forget every- 
thing that has happened here be- 
tween us,” Calapine said. “You 
will repeat our conversation to 
no person.” 

Svengaard cleared his throat. 
“To no one . Calapine?” 

“No one.” 

“Max Allgood has asked that I 
report to him on — ” 

“Max must be denied,” she 
said. “Fear not, Thei Svengaard. 
We will protect you.” 

“As you command,” Svengaard 
said. “Calapine.” 

“It is not our wish that you 
think us ungrateful of your loy- 
alty and services,” Nourse said. 
“We are mindful of your good 
opinion and would not appear 
cold nor callous in your eyes. 
Know that our concern is for the 
larger good of humankind.” 

“Yes, Nourse,” Svengaard said. 
It was a gratituitous speech, its 
tone disturbing to Svengaard, but 



it helped clear his reason. He be- 
gan to see the direction of their 
curiosity, to sense their suspic- 
ions. Those were his suspicions 
now. Potter had betrayed his 
trust, had he? The business with 
the accidentally destroyed tape 
had not been an accident. Very 
well — the criminals would pay! 

“You may go now,” Nourse 
said. 

“With our blessing,” Calapine 
said. 

Svengaard bowled. And he 
marked that Schruille had not 
spoken or moved during the en- 
tire interview. Svengaard won- 
dered why this fact, of itself, 
should be a suddenly terrifying 
thing. His knees trembled as he 
turned, the acolytes flanking him 
with their smoking thuribles, and 
left the hall. 

'T'hey watched until the barrier 
dropped behind Svengaard. 

“Another one who doesn’t 
know what Potter achieved,” 
Calapine said. 

“Are you sure Max doesn’t 
know?” Schruille asked. 

“I’m sure,” she said. 

“Then we should’ve told him.” 

“And told him how we knew?” 
she asked. 

“I know the argument,” Schru- 
ille said. “Blunt the instrument, 
spoil the work.” 

“That Svengaard, he’s one of 
the reliable ones,” Nourse said.

“It is said we walk the sharp 
edge of a knife,” Schruille said. 
“When you walk the knife, you 
must be careful how you place 
your feet.” 

“What a disgusting idea,” 
Calapine said. She turned to 
Nourse. “Are you still hobbying 
daVinci, dearest?” 

“His bmsh stroke,” Nourse 
said. “A most exacting discipline. 
I should have it in forty or fifty 
years. Soon at any rate.” 

“Provided you’ve placed each 
step correctly,” Schruille said. 

Presently, Nourse said : “Some- 
times, Schruille, you allow cyn- 
icism to carry you beyond the 
bounds of propriety.” He turned, 
studied the instrument gauges, 
sensors, peek-eyes and read-outs 
across from Calapine on the in- 
ner wall of the globe. “It’s reas- 
onably quiet today. Shall we 
leave the control with Schruille, 
Cal, and go down for a swim and 
a pharmacy session?” 

“Body tone, body tone,” Schru- 
ille complained. “Have you ever 
considered doing twenty-five 
laps of the pool instead of twen- 
ty?” 

“You say the most astonishing 
things of late,” Calapine said. 
“Would you have Nourse upset 
his enzyme balance? I fail com- 
pletely to understand you.” 

“Fail to try,” Schruille said. 

“Is there anything we can do 
for you?” she asked. 



“My cycle has plunged me into 
dreadful monotony,” Schruille 
said. “Is there something you can 
do about that?” 

Nourse looked at Schruille in 
the prismatic reflector. The 
man’s voice with its suggestion of 
a whine had grown increasingly 
annoying of late. Nourse was be- 
ginning to regret that commun- 
ity of tastes and bodily require- 
ments had thrown them togeth- 
er. Perhaps when the Tuyere’s 
service was done . 

“Monotony,” Calapine said. 
She shrugged. 

“There’s a certain triumph in 
well-considered monotony,” 
Nourse said. “That’s Voltaire, I 
believe.” 

“It sounded like the purest 
Nourse,” Schruille said. 

“I sometimes find it helpful,” 
Calapine said, “to invoke a be- 
nign concern for the Folk.” 

“Even among ourselves?” 
Schruille asked. 

“Consider the fate of the poor 
computer nurse,” she said “In 
the abstract, naturally. Can you 
not feel sorrow and pity?” 

“Pity’s a wasteful emotion,” 
Schruille said. “Sorrow is akin 
to cynicism.” He smiled. “This 
will pass. Go to your swim. When 
the vigor’s on you, think of me 
. here.” 

Nourse and Calapine stood, or- 
dered the carrier beams into posi- 
tion. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES

“Efficiency,” Nourse said. “We 
must seek more efficiency in our 
minions. Things must be made 
to run more smoothly.” 

Schruille looked up at them 
waiting for the beams. He wanted 
only to be free of the wanton 
rambling of their voices. They 
missed the point, insisted on miss- 
ing it. 

“Efficiency?” Calapine asked. 
“Perhaps you’re right.” 

Schruille no longer could con- 
tain the emotions at war within 
him. “Efficiency’s the opposite 
of craftsmanship,” he said. 
“Think on that!” 

'T^he place was a pumping sta- 
Calapine slid down and away 
v/ithout answering, leaving Schru- 
ille to close the segment. 

He sat alone at last within the 
green-blue-red winking of the 
control center — alone except for 
the glittering eyes of scanners 
activated along the upper circle 
of the globe. He counted ei<Thty- 
one of them alive and staring at 
him and at the responses of the 
globe. Eighty-one of his fellows — 
or groups of his fellows — were 
out there observing him and his 
work as he observed the Folk 
and their work. 

The scanners imparted a vague 
uneasiness to Schruille. Before 
the Tuyere’s service, he could 
never remember watching the 
control center or its activities. 

62 



Too much that was painful an i 
unthinkable occurred here. Were 
they former masters of the con- 
trol center, curious about how the 
new trio dispatched its duties? 
Who were the watchers? 

Schruille dropped his attention 
to the instruments. In moments 
like this he often felt like Chen 
Tzu-ang’s “Master of Dark 
Truth” who saw the whole world 
in a jade bottle. Here was the 
jade bottle — this globe. A flick 
of the power ring on the arm of 
his throne and he could watch a 
couple making love in Warsop- 
olis, study the contents of an em- 
bryo vat in Greater London or 
loose hypnotic gas with taming 
suggestions into a warren of New 
Peking. The touch of a key and 
he could analyze the .shifting mo- 
tives of an entire work force in 
the megalopolis of Roma. 

Searching within himself, 
Schruille could not find the im- 
pulse to move a single control. 

He thought back, trying to re- 
member how many scanners hnrl 
watched the first years of the 
Tuyere’s service. He was sure it 
had never exceeded ten or twelve. 
But now — eighty-one. 

7 should’ve warned them about 
Sven^aard, he thought. I could’ ve 
said that we shouldn’t rely on the 
assumption there’s 'a special Prov- 
idence for fools. Sven^aard is a 
fool who disturbs me. 

But Nourse and Calapine 

GALAXY 



would’ve defended Svengaard. 
He knew it. They’d have insisted 
the man was reliable, honorable, 
loyal. They’d wager anything on 
it 

Anything? Schruille wondered. 
Is there something they might not 
wager on Svengaard’s loyalty? 

Schruille could almost hear 
Nourse pontificating; Our judg- 
ment of Svengaard is the correct 
one. 

And that, Schruille thought, is 
what disturbs me. Svengaard 
worships us ... as does Max. But 
worship is nine-tenths fear. 

In time, everything becomes 
fear. 

Schruille looked up at the 
watching scanners, spoke aloud: 
“Time-time-time . 

Let that chew at their vitals, 
he thought. 

XII 

T he place was a pumping sta- 
tion for the salvage reclama- 
tion system of Seatac megalop- 
olis. It lay at the eleven hundred 
foot level on the spur line that 
sent byproduct irrigation water 
into Grand Coulee system. A 
four-story box of sampling pipes, 
computer consoles and access cat- 
walks aglow with force-buoyed 
lights, it throbbed to the pulse of 
the giant turbines it controlled. 

The Durants had come down 
through the personnel tubes dur- 



ing the evening rush hour, mov- 
ing in easy random stages that 
insured they weren’t followed and 
that they carried no tracer de- 
vices. Five inspection tubes had 
passed them as clean. 

Still, they were careful to read 
the faces and actions of the peo- 
ple who jostled past. Most of the 
people were dull pages, hurried, 
intent on their own business. Oc- 
casionally, they exchanged a 
mutual reading-glance with an- 
other courier, or identified sub- 
officials with the fear goading 
them on Optiman errands. 

No one noticed a couple in 
workman brown, their hands 
clasped, who emerged onto Cat- 
walk Nine of the pumping sta- 
tion. 

The Durants paused there to 
survey their surroundings. They 
were tired, elated and more than 
a little awed at having been sum- 
moned into the control core of 
the Parents Underground. The 
smell of hydrocarbons filled the 
air around them. Lizbeth sniffed. 

Her silent conversation through 
their clasped hands carried over- 
tones of tension. Harvey worked 
to reassure her. 

“It’s probably our Glisson 
we’re to see,” he said. 

“There could be other Cyborgs 
with the same name,” she said. 

“Not likely.” 

He urged her out onto the cat- 
walk, past a hover light. They

took a left branching past two 
workmen reading pitot gauges, 
their faces in odd shadows creat- 
ed by the lights from below. 

Lizbeth felt the lonely expos- 
ure of their position, signaled: 
“How can we be sure they aren’t 
watching us here?” 

“This must be one of our 
places,” he said. “You know.” 
“How can it be?” 

“Route the scanners through 
editing computers,” he said. “The 
Opts see only what we want them 
to see then.” 

“It’s dangerous to feel sure of 
such things,” she said. Then; 
“Why have they summoned us?” 
“We’ll know in a few minutes,” 
he said. 

The walk led through a dust- 
excluding lock port into a tool 
bunker, gray walls punctured by 
outlets for transmission tubes, the 
inevitable computer controls 
blinking, ticking, chuckling, whir- 
ring. The place smelled of a 
sweet oil. 

As the port clanged shut be- 
hind the Durants, a figure came 
from their left and sat on a pad- 
ded bench across from them. 

^T'he Durants stared silently, 
recognizing and repelled by 
the recognition. The figure’s out- 
line suggested neither man nor 
woman. It looked planted there 
in the seat, and as they watched, 
it pulled thin cables from pockets 



in its gray coveralls, plugged the 
cables into the computer wall. 

Harvey brought his attention 
up to the square, deeply seamed 
face and the light gray eyes with 
their stare of blank directness, 
that coldly measured observation 
which was a trademark of the 
Cyborg. 

“Glisson,” Harvey said. “You 
summoned us?” 

“I summoned you,” the Cyborg 
said. “It has been many years, 
Durant. Do you still fear us? I 
see that you do. You are late.” 
“We’re unfamiliar with this 
area,” Harvey said. 

“We came carefully;” Lizbeth 
said. 

“Then I taught you well.” 
Glisson said. “You are reason- 
ably good pupils.” 

Through their clasped hands, 
Lizbeth signaled: “They’re so 
hard to read, but something’s 
wrong.” She averted her eyes 
from the Cyborg, chilled by the 
weighted stare. No matter how 
she tried to think of them as flesh 
and blood, her mind could never 
evade the knowledge that such 
bodies contained miniaturized 
computers linked directly to the 
brain, that the arms were not 
arms but prosthetic tools and 
weapons. And the voice — such a 
clipped-off unemotional quality. 

“You should not fear us, Ma- 
dame,” Glisson said. “Unless you 
are not Lizbeth Durant.” 



64 



GALAXY 



Harvey failed to repress the 
snap of anger, said: “Don’t talk 
to her that way! You don’t own 
us.” 

“What is the first lesson I 
taught you after you were re- 
cruited?” Glisson asked. 

Harvey brought himself under 
control, forced a rueful smile on- 
to his mouth. “To hold our tem- 
pers,” he said. Lizbeth’s hand 
continued to tremble in his. 

“That lesson you did not learn 
well,” Glisson said. “I overlook 
your fallibility.” 

Through their hands, Lizbeth 
signaled : “It was prepared for 
violence against us.” 

Harvey acknowledged. 

“First,” Glisson said, “you will 
report on the genetic operation.” 
There was a pause while the Cy- 
borg changed its jacked connec- 
tions to the computer wall. “Do 
not be distracted by my work, 
I distribute tools — thus.” It in- 
dicated the bunker, “this space, 
which appears on their screens 
as a chamber filled with tools, 
will never be investigated.” 

A bench slid from the wall to 
the Durants’ right. “If you are 
fatigued, sit,” Glisson said. The 
Cyborg indicated its cable link- 
age to the wall computer. “I sit 
only that I may carry on the 
work of this space while we 
speak.” The Cyborg smiled, a 
stiff rictus to signify that the 
Durants must realize such as 



Glisson did not feel fatigue. 

Harvey urged Lizbeth to the 
bench. They sat as he signaled: 
Caution. Glisson’s maneuvering 
us. Something’s being hidden.” 

j^lisson turned slightly to face 
them, said: “A verbal, fac- 
tual, complete report. Leave out 
nothing, no matter how trivial it 
may seem to you. I have limitless 
capacity for data.” 

They began recounting what 
they had observed of the genetic 
operation, taking up from each 
other on cue without a break as 
good couriers were taught to do. 
Harvey experienced the odd feel- 
ing during the recital that he and 
Lizbeth became part of the Cy- 
borg’s mechanism. Questions 
came so mechanically from Glis- 
son’s lips. Their answers felt so 
clinical. He had to keep remind- 
ing himself: This is our son we 
discuss. 

Presently, Glisson said: “There 
seems no doubt we’ve another 
self-viable. Your evidence vir- 
tually completes the picture. We 
have other data, you know.” 

“I didn’t know the surgeon 
was one of us,” Lizbeth said. 

There was a pause while Glis- 
son’s eyes went even blanker 
than usual. The Durants felt they 
could almost see the esoteric for- 
mulae flitting through Glisson’s 
thinking-banks. It was said the 
Cyborgs composed most of their 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



65 



thoughts only in higher math, 
translating to common language 
as it suited them. 

“The surgeon was not one of 
us,” Glisson said. “But he soon 
will be.” 

What strategic formula pro- 
duced those words? Harvey won- 
dered. “What about the computer 
tape on the operation?” he asked. 

“It’s destroyed,” Glisson said. 
“Even now, your embryo is being 
removed to a safe place. You will 
join him soon.” A mechanical 
chuckle escaped the Cyborg’s 
lips. 

Lizbeth shivered. Harvey felt 
the tension of her through their 
hands. He said: “Is our son 

safe?” 

“Safe,” Glisson said. “Our 
plans insure that safety.” 

“How?” Lizbeth asked. 

“You will understand soon,” 
Glisson said. “An ancient and re- 
liable way of safe concealment. 
Be assured: self-viables are val- 
uable weapons. We do not risk 
our valuable weapons.” 

Lizbeth signaled: “The cut — 
ask now.” 

Harvey wet his lips with his 
tongue, said: “There are . 
when a Central surgeon’s called 
in, usually it means the embryo 
could be cut to Optiman. Did 
they ... is our son . .” 

Glisson’s nostrils flared. The 
face took on a look of hauteur 
that said such ignorance insulted 



a Cyborg. The clipped voice said : 
“We would require a complete 
tape record, including the enzy- 
mic data even to guess. The tape 
is gone. Only the surgeon knows 
the result of the operation for 
certain. We have yet to question 
him.” 

Lizbeth said: “Svengaard or 
the computer nurse might’ve 
said something that . .” 

“Svengaard is a dolt,” Glisson 
said. “The computer nurse is 
dead.” 

“They killed her?” Lizbeth 
whispered. 

“How she died isn’t important,” 
Glisson said. “She served her 
purpose.” 

W'th his hand, Harvey sig- 
naled: “The Cyborgs certainly 
had something to do with her 
death.” 

“I saw,” she answered. 

Harvey said: “Are you . 
v/ill we be allovred to talk to 
Potter?” 

“Potter will be offered full 
Cyborg status,” Glisson said. 
“Talking will be his decision . 
afterward.” 

“We want to know about our 
son!” Lizbeth flared. 

Harvey signaled frantically : 
“Apologize!” 

“Madame,” Glisson said, “let 
me remind you the so-called 
Optiman cut is not a state to 
which we aspire. Remember your 
vows.” 



66 



GALAXY 



S he squeezed Harvey’s hand to 
silence his signals, said: “I’m 
sorry. It was such a shock to 
learn . the possibility . 

“Your emotional excesses are 
taken into account as a mitigat- 
ing circumstance,” Glisson said. 
“It is well, therefore, that I warn 
you of a thing to happen. You 
will hear things about your son 
which you must not let excite 
you.” 

“What things?” Lizbeth whis- 
pered. 

“An outside force of unknown 
origin sometimes interferes with 
the anticipated course of a gen- 
etic operation,” Glisson said. 
“There is reason to believe this 
happened with your son.” 

“What do you mean?” Harvey 
asked. 

“Mean!” Glisson sneered. 
“You ask questions to which 
there are no answers.” 

“What does this . thing do?” 
Lizbeth supplied. 

Glisson looked at her. “It be- 
haves somewhat in the fashion of 
a charged particle, penetrates the 
genetic core and alters the struc- 
ture. If this has happened to your 
son, you may consider it bene- 
ficial because it apparently pre- 
vents the Optiman cut.” 

The Durants digested this. 
Presently Harvey said: “Do 
you require more of us? May we 
go now?” 

“You will remain here.” 



They stared. 

“You will wait for further or- 
ders,” Glisson said. 

“But we’ll be missed,” Lizbeth 
said. “Our apartment, they’ll — ” 
“We’ve raised doppelgangers 
to play your roles long enough 
for you to escape Seatac,” Glis- 
son said. “You can never go back. 
You should’ve known this.” 
Harvey’s lips moved, then: 
“Escape? What’s . why are . .” 
“There is violence,” Glisson 
said. “Even now. The death-wish 
cults win have their day.” The 
Cyborg raised its gaze toward the 
ceiling. “War . blood . kill- 
ing. It will be as it was before 
when the skies flamed and the 
earth ran molten.” 

Harvey cleared his throat. 
Wars . before. Glisson gave 
the impression that wars had 
been recent, perhaps gnly yes- 
terday. And for this Cyborg that 
might be true. It was said that 
Glisson’s grandsir had fought in 
the Optiman- Cyborg war. No one 
of the Underground Folk knew 
how many identities Glisgon had 
lived. 

“Where’ll we go?” Harvey 
asked. He signaled Lizbeth not 
to interrupt. 

“A place has been prepared.” 
The Cyborg arose, unplugged 
its linkage with the computer 
panel, said: “You will wait here. 
Do not attempt to leave. Your 
needs will be provided for.”

and it sealed with a heavy thump.

tt^'T^hey’re as bad as the Op- 
■*' timen,” Lizbeth signaled. 

“The day will come when we’re 
free of both them and the Opts,” 
Harvey said. 

“It’ll never happen,” she said. 

“Don’t say that!” he ordered. 

“If only we knew a friendly 
surgeon,” she said. We could 
take our son and run.” 

“That’s foolishness! How could 
we service the vat without ma- 
chinery for . .” 

“I’ve that machinery right in- 
side me,” she said. “I was . 
born with it.” 

Harvey stared at her, shocked 
speechless. 

“I dcpi’t want the Cyborgs or 
the Opts controlling our son’s 
life,” she said, “regulating his 
mind with hypnotic gas, making 
duplicates of him for their own 
purposes, pushing him and lead- 
ing him and ...” 

“Don’t work yourself into a 
state,” he said. 

“You heard him,” she said. 
“Doppelgangers! They can reg- 
ulate anything — our very being! 
They can condition us to ... to 
... do anything! For all we 
know, we’ve been conditioned to 
be here right now!” 

“You’re being unreasonable.” 



“Unreasonable? Look at me! 
They can take a piece of my skin 
and grow an identical copy. Me! 
Identical! How do you know I’m 
me? How do you know I’m the 
original me? How do I know?” 
He gripped her free arm and 
for a moment had no words. Pres- 
ently, he forced himself to relax, 
shook his head. “You’re you, 
Liz. You’re not flesh grown from 
a cell. You’re ... all the things 
we’ve shared . and been . 
and done together They couldn’t 
duplicate memories . not that 
with a doppelganger.” 

She pressed her cheek against 
the rough fabric of his jacket, 
wanting the comfort of it, the 
tactile sensation that told her 
body he was here and he was 
real. 

“They’ll make doppelgangers 
of our son,” she said. “That’s 
what they’re planning.” 

“Then we’ll have many sons.” 
“For what reason?” She looked 
up at him, her lashes damp with 
unshed tears. “You heard what 
Glisson said. Something from 
outside adjusted our embryo. 
What was it?” 

“Soiliebody must know.” 

“I know you,” he said. “You 
want to think it’s God.” 

“What else could it be?’’ 
“Anything — chance, accident, 
some higher order manipulator. 
Maybe someone’s discovered 
something they’re not sharing.”

“One of us? They wouldn’t!” 
“Nature, then,” he said. “Na- 
ture asserting itself in the interest 
of Man.” 

“Sometimes you sound like a 
cultist!” 

“It isn’t the Cyborgs,” he said. 
“We know that.” 

“Glisson said it was benefic- 
ent.” 

“But it’s genetic shaping. 
That’s blasphemy to them. Physi- 
cal alteration of the bioframe, 
that’s their way.” 

“Like Glisson,” she said. “That 
robot with flesh.” Again, she 
pressed her cheek against him. 
“That’s what I fear — they’ll do 
that to our son . our sons.” 
“The courier service outnum- 
bers the Cyborgs a hundred to 
one,” he said. “As long as we 
.stick together, we’ll win.” 

“But we’re just flesh,” she said, 
“and so weak.” 

“And we can do something all 
those Sterries together can’t do,” 
he reminded her. “We can per- 
petuate our own kind.” 

“What does it matter?” she 
asked. “Optimen never die.” 

tcQvengaard waited for night 
^ and checked the area 
through the observation screens 
in his office before going down to 
the vat room. In spite of the fact 
that this was his hospital and he 
had a perfect right here, he was 
conscious of doing a forbidden 



thing. The significance of the ir - 
terview at Central hadn’t escaped 
him. The Optimen wouldn’t like 
this. But he had to look in that 
vat. 

He paused in the darkness of 
the vat room, stood there near 
the door, realizing with a sense 
of detachment that he had never 
before been in here without the 
full blaze of lights. There were 
only the glow bulbs behind 
gauges and telltales now — ^faint 
dots and circles of luminescence 
by which to orient himself. 

The thrap-thrap-thrap of via- 
pumps created an odd contra- 
puntal rhythm w'hich filled the 
gloom with a sense of urgency. 
Svengaard imagined all the em- 
bryos in there (twenty-one at the 
morning count) their cells reach- 
ing out, doubling and redoubling 
in the strange ecstasy of growth 
— becoming unique, distinct, dis- 
crete individuals. 

Not for them the contraceptive 
gas that permeated Folk breath- 
ing spaces. Not yet. Now, they 
could grow almost as their an- 
cestors had grown before the 
genetic engineers. 

Svengaard sniffed. 

His nostrils, instinctively alert- 
ed by the darkness, sensed the 
amniotic saltiness of the air. 
From its odor, this room could 
almost have been a primal sea- 
shore with life burgeoning in its 
ooze. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES

Svengaard shuddered and re- 
minded himself: I’m a submolec- 
utar engineer, a gene surgeon. 
There’s nothing strange here. 

But the thought failed to con- 
vince him. 

He pushed himself away from 
the door, headed down the line 
looking for the vat with the Du- 
rant embryo. In his mind lay the 
clear memory of wbat he had 
seen in that embryo — the in- 
trusion that had flooded the cells 
with arginine. Intrusion. Where 
had it originated? Was Potter 
correct? Was it an unknown crea- 
tor of stability? Stability . 
order . systems. Extended sys- 
tems . infinite aspects of en- 
ergy that left all matter insub- 
stantial. 

These suddenly were frighten- 
ing thoughts here in the whisper- 
ing gloom. 

He stumbled against a low in- 
strument stand, cursed softly. His 
stomach felt tight with the ur- 
gency of the viapumps and the 
real urgency in the fact that he 
had to finish here before the duty 
nurse made her hourly rounds. 

An insect shape, shadow 
against shadows, stood out 
against the wall in front of him. 
He froze and it took a moment 
for him to recognize the familiar 
outlines of the meson microscope. 

Svengaard turned to the lum- 
inous numbers on the vats — 
twelve, thirteen, fourteen . 



fifteen. Here it Was. He checked 
the name on the tag, reading it 
in the glow of a gauge bulb : 
“Durant.” 

Something about this embryo 
^ had the Optimen upset and 
Security in an uproar. His regu- 
lar computer nurse was gone — 
where, nobody could say. The re- 
placement walked like a man. 

Svengaard wheeled out the 
microscope, moving gently in the 
darkness, positioned the instru- 
ment over the vat, made the con- 
nections by feel. The vat throbbed 
against his fingers. He rigged for 
scanning, bent to the viewer. 

Up out of the swarming cellu- 
lar mass came a hydrophilic gene 
segment. He centered on it, the 
darkness forgotten as he pushed 
his awareness into the scope- 
lighted field of the viewer. Meson 
probes slid down . down into 
the mitochondrial structure. He 
found the alpha-helices and be- 
gan checking out polypeptide 
chains. 

A puzzled frown creased his 
brow. He switched to another cell. 
Another. 

The cells were low in arginine 
— he could see that. Thoughts 
brushed their way through his 
mind as he peered and hunted: 
How could the Durant embryo, 
of all embryos, be low on ar- 
ginine? Any normal male would 
have more sperm protamine than 



70 



GALAXY 



this. How could the ADP-ATP 
exchange system carry no hint of 
Optiman? The cut wouldn’t make 
this much difference. 

Abruptly, Svengaard sent his 
probes down into the sex identi- 
fiers, scanned the overlapping he- 
lices. 

Female! 

He straightened, checked num- 
ber and tag. “Fifteen. Durant.” 

Svengaard bent to the inspec- 
tion chart, read it in the gauge 
glow. It showed the duty nurse’s 
notations for the eighty-first 
hour. He glanced at his watch: 
still twenty minutes before she 
made the eighty-second hour 
check. 

The Durant embryo could not 
possibly be female, he thought. 
Not from Potter’s operation. 

Someone had switched em- 
bryos, he realized. One embryo 
would activate the vat’s life-sys- 
tem responses much like another. 
Without microscopic examina- 
tion, the change couldn’t be de- 
tected. 

Who? 

In Svengaard’s mind, the most 
likely candidates were the Opti- 
men. They’d removed the Du- 
rant embryo to a safe place and 
left a substitute. 

Why? 

Bait, he thought. Bait. 

Who are they trying to catch? 

He straightened, mouth dry, 
heart pumping rapidly. A sound 



at the wall to his left brought him 
whirling around. The vat room’s 
emergency computer panel had 
come to life, tapes beginning to 
turn, lights winking. A read-out 
board clattered. 

But there was no operator! 
Svengaard whirled to run from 
the room, collided with a blocky, 
unmoving shape. Arms and hand:: 
gripped him with unmerciful 
pressure and he saw beyond his 
captor, a section of the vat room 
wall open with dim light there 
and movement. 

Then darkness exploded in his 
skull. 

XIV 

geatac Hospital’s new compu- 
^ ter nurse got Max Allgood on 
the phone after only a short de- 
lay while Security traced him. 
Allgood’s eyes appeared sunken. 
His mouth was pulled into a 
thin line. 

“Yes?” he said. “Oh, it’s you.” 
“Something important’s come 
up,” she said. “Svengaard’s in 
the vat room examining the Du- 
rant embryo under microscope.” 
Allgood rolled his eyes. “Oh, 
for the love of ... Is that why 
you got me out of ... is that 
why you called me?” 

“But there was a noise and you 
said . .” 

“Forget it.” 

“I tell you there was a com- 

71 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



motion of some kind in that room 
and now Doctor Svengaard’s 
gone. I didn’t see him go.” 

“He probably left by another 
door.” 

“There is no other door.” 
“Look, sweetie, I have half a 
hundred agents tiiere covering 
that room like a blanket. A fly 
couldn’t move in that room with- 
out our scanners picking it up.” 
“Then check with them to see 
where Svengaard’s gone.” 

“Oh, for . 

“Check.” 

“All right!” Allgood turned to 
his hot line, got the duty agent. 
The computer nurse could hear 
him through her open line. 
“Where’s Svengaard?” 

A muffled voice responded: 
“Just went in and examined the 
Durant embryo under miscro- 
cope, then left.” 

“Went out the door?” 

“Just walked out.” 

Allgood’s face came back on- 
to the computer nurse’s screen. 
“You hear that?” 

“I heard, but I’ve been down at 
the end of the hall ever since he 
went in. He didn’t come out.” 
“You probably turned your 
back for five seconds.” 

“Well . .” 

“You did, didn’t you?” 

“I may’ve looked away just for 
a second, but . .” 

“So you missed him.” 

“But I heard a commotion.” 

72 



“If there was anything wrong, 
my men would’ve reported it. 
Now, forget this. Svengaard’s no 
problem. They said he’d probably 
do this and we could ignore it. 
They’re never wrong about such 
things.” 

“If you’re sure.” 

“I’m sure.” 

“Say, why are we so interested 
in that embryo?” 

“You don’t need to know, 
sweetie. Get back to work and 
let me get some sleep.” 

She broke the connection, still 
wondering about the noise she 
had heard. It had somided like 
something being hit. 

\ llgood sat staring at the blank 
screen after the nurse signed 
off. Noise? Commotion? He 
formed a circle with his mouth, 
exhaled slowly. Crazy damn fe- 
male! 

Abruptly, he stood up, turned 
back to his bed. The doxie play- 
mate he’d brought in for the 
night lay there in the rosy light 
of a gloom dispeller, half awake, 
looking at him. Her eyes under 
long lashes filled him with sud- 
den rage. 

“Get the hell out of here!” he 
roared. 

She sat upright in the bed, wide 
awake, staring. 

“Out!” he said, pointing to the 
door. 

She tumbled out of bed, grab- 

GALAXY 



bed her clothing and ran out the 
door, a flash of pink flesh. 

Only when she’d gone did AO- 
good realize who she’d reminded 
him of — Calapine, a dull Cala- 
pine. He wondered at himself 
then. The Cyborg had said the 
adjustments they made, the in- 
struments they’d implanted, 
would help him control his emo- 
tions, permit him to lie with im- 
punity even to Optimen. This 
outburst now — it frightened him. 
He stared down at one of his 
slippers abandoned on the gray 
rug, its mate vanished some- 
where. He kicked the slipper, be- 
gan pacing back and forth. 

Something was wrong. He 
could feel it. He’d lived almost 
four hundred lovely years, most 
of them in Optiman service. He 
had a well-trained instinct for 
rightness and wrongness. It was 
survival. 

Something was wrong. 

Had the Cyborg lied to him? 
Was he being used for some trick 
of their own? 

He stumbled over the slipper. 

Noiee. Commotion. 

With a low curse, he returned 
to the hot line, got his duty agent. 
The man’s face on the screen 
looked like an infant — puffy 
lips and big, eager eyes. 

“Go down to that vat room 
and inspect it,” Allgood said. 
“The fine tooth. Look for signs 
of a commotion.” 



“But if anybody sees us . .” 

“Damn it to hell! Do as I say!” 

“Yes, sir!” 

The agent clicked off. 

Allgood threw off his robe, all 
thought of sleep forgotten, ran 
through a quick shower and be- 
gan dressing. 

Something was wrong. He 
could feel it. Before leaving his 
quarters he put out a call to have 
Svengaard picked up and brought 
in for questioning. 

XV 

T)y eight a.m., the streets and 
speedwalks of Seatac’s in- 
dustrial district-north swarmed 
with machine and foot traffic — 
the jostling impersonals of peo- 
ple following the little strung- 
out channels of their private con- 
cerns. Weather control had said 
the day would be held to a com- 
fortable seventy-eight Fahrenheit 
with no clouds. An hour from 
now, as the day settled into its 
working tempo, traffic would be- 
come more sparse. Dr. Potter 
had seen the city at that pace 
many times, but he had never 
before been immersed in the shift- 
break swarm. 

He was aware that the Par- 
ents Underground had chosen this 
time for its natural concealment. 
He and his guide were just two 
more impersonals here. Who 
would notice them? This didn’t

subtract, though, from his fas- 
cinated interest in a scene that 
was new to him. 

A big female Sterrie in the 
green-white striped uniform of 
a machine-press operator in the 
heavy industry complex pushed 
past him. She looked to Potter 
like a B2022419i^G8-cut with 
cream skin and heavy features. 
On a gold loop in her right ear 
she wore a dancing doll breeder 
fetish. 

Almost in lock step behind her 
trotted a short man with hunched 
up shoulders carrying a short 
brass rod. He flashed an impish 
grin at Potter as they passed, as 
much as to say: “Here’s the only 
way to get through a crowd like 
this.” 

Potter’s guide turned Potter 
aside onto the step-down walk 
and then into a side street. The 
guide was an enigma to Potter, 
who couldn’t place the cut. The 
man wore a plain brown service 
suit, coveralls. He appeared rea- 
sonably normal except for a pale, 
almost sickly skin. His deeply set 
eyes glittered almost like lenses. 
A skull cap concealed his hair 
except for a few dark brown 
strands that looked almost arti- 
ficial. His hands when they touch- 
ed Potter to guide him felt cold 
and faintly repellent. 

The crowd thinned here as the 
step-down walk rounded a corner 
into a by-way canyon between 

74 



two towering windowless build- 
ings. There was dust in this 
cavernous street, rising up and 
almost concealing a distant tra- 
cery of bridges. Potter wondered 
at the dust. It was as though the 
director of local weather allowed 
dust here in an unconscious pas- 
sion for naturalness. 

A bulky man hurried past them 
and Potter was caught by the 
look of his hands — thick wrists, 
bulging knuckles, homed callous- 
es. He had no idea what work 
could cause such deformity. 

^^he guide steered them now 
onto a succession of drop 
walks and into the cave of an al- 
ley. The swarm was left behind. 
A feeling of detachment seized 
Potter. He felt he was reliving 
an old and familiar experience. 

Why did I come with this per- 
son? he wondered. 

The guide wore the wheeled 
blazon of a transport driver on 
his shoulder, but he’d said right 
out he was from the Parents Un- 
derground. 

“I know what you did for us,” 
he’d said. “Now we will do 
something for you.” A turn of 
the head. “Come.” 

They’d talked only briefly aft- 
er that, but Potter had known 
from the first the guide had cor- 
rectly identified himself. This 
was no trick. 

Then why did I accept the in- 
GALAXY 




HEISENBERG'S EYES 



vitation? Potter asked himself. 
Certainly it wasn’t for the veiled 
promises of extended life and 
instant knowledge. There were 
Cyborgs behind this, of course, 
and he suspected this guide might 
be one of them. Most of the Op- 
timen and Servant Uppers tended 
to discount the Folk rumors that 
Cyborgs did exist, but Potter had 
never joined the cynics and scof- 
fers. He could no more explain 
why than he could explain his 
presence here in this alley-cave 
walking between dark plasmeld 
walls illuminated by the ghost 
flicker of overhead glowtubes. 

Potter suspected he had at last 
rebelled against one of the three 
curses of their age — modera- 
tion, drugs and alcohol. Narco- 
pleasures and alcohol had tempt- 
ed him in their time . ". and 
finally moderation. He knew it 
wasn’t normal for the times. Bet- 
ter to take up with one of the 
wild sex cults. But pointless sex 
without even the faint hope of 
issue had palled on him, although 
he knew this for a sign of final 
dissolution. 

The alley opened into one of 
the lost squares of the megalopo- 
lis — a triangular paving and 
fountain that looked to be real 
stone, green with the slime of 
ages. 

The Optimen don’t know about 
this place, Potter thought. They 
despised stone which eroded and 



wore away — in their time. 
Regenerative plasmeld was the 
thing. It stood unmoved and un- 
moving for all time. 

The guide slowed as they 
reached the open air. Potter 
noted a faint smell of chemicals 
about the man, oily sweetness, 
and a tiny scar running diagonal- 
ly down the back of his neck 
into his collar. 

Why didn’t he try to black- 
mail me into coming? Potter 
wondered. Could he be that sure? 
Could ^anyone know me that well? 

“We have a job for you,” the 
guide had said. “An operation 
you must perform.” 

Curiosity is my weakness. Pot- 
ter thought. That’s why I’m here. 

The guide put a hand on Pot- 
ter’s arm, said: “Stop. Wait.” 

'"T^he tone was conversational, 
calm, but Potter felt hidden 
tensions. He looked up and 
around. The buildings were win- 
dowless, faceless. A wide door 
stood out in the angle of another 
alleyway ahead. They had come 
almpst around the fountain 
without encountering another 
person. Nothing stirred or moved 
around them. There was only the 
faint rumbling of distant ma- 
chinery. 

“What is it?” Potter whispered. 
“Why’re we waiting?” 

“Nothing,” the guide said. 
“Wait.” 



76 



GALAXY 



Potter shrugged. 

His mind veered back to the 
first encounter with this crea- 
ture. How could they know what 
I achieved with that embryo? It 
must be the computer nurse. 
She’s one of them. 

The guide had refused to say. 

I came because I hoped they 
could help me solve the mystery 
of the Durant embryo, he 
thought. They were the source 
of the arginine intrusion — thafs 
what I suspect. 

He thought of Svengaard’s 
description — a contrail-like in- 
trusion. It had deposited arginine- 
rich sperm protamine through 
the coiled alpha-helices of the 
embryo’s cells. Then had come 
the operation — the cysteine 
masked, neutralized with sulfhy- 
dryl and the ATP phase . 
oligomycin and azide . the 
exchange reaction inhibited. 

Potter stared up at the patch 
of blue sky framed by the build- 
ings around the square. His mind, 
concentrated on the Durant cut- 
ting, had encountered a new idea. 
He no longer saw the sky. His 
awareness was back within the 
swarming cell structure, follow- 
ing the mitochondrial systems 
like an undersea hunter. 

“It could be repeated,” Pot- 
ter whispered. 

“Silence,” the guide hissed. 

Potter nodded. On any embryo 
'ad all, he thought. The key’s the 



arginine flooding. I could dupli- 
cate that myself on the basis of 
Sven’s description. Gods! We 
could make billions of Durant 
embryos! And every one of them 
self -viable! 

He took a deep breath, dis- 
mayed by the realization that — 
with the record tape erased — 
his memory might be the only 
container of that entire operation 
and its implications. Svengaard 
and the computer nurse could 
have only part of it. They hadn’t 
been in there, immersed in the 
heart of the cell. 

A brilliant surgeon might de- 
duce what had happened and be 
able to reproduce the operation 
from the partial records, but only 
if he were to set the problem. 
Who would ever take up this 
problem? Not the Optimen. Not 
that dolt Svengaard. 

The guide tugged at Potter’s 
arm. Potter looked down into 
that flat, chill-eyed face with its 
lack of genetic identification. 

“We are observed,” the guide 
said in an oddly depersonalized 
tone. “Listen to me very care- 
fully. Your life depends on it.” 

■potter shook his head, blinked. 

He felt removed from his own 
person, become only a set of 
senses to record this man’s words 
and actions. 

“You will go through that door 
ahead of us,” the guide said. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



77 



Potter turned, looked at the 
door. Two men carrying paper- 
wrapped parcels emerged from 
the alley in front of it, hurried 
around the square opposite them. 
The guide ignored them. Potter 
heard a babble of young voices 
growing louder in the alley. But 
the guide did not pay any at- 
tention to these either. 

“Inside that building, you will 
take the first door on your left,” 
he said. “You will see a woman 
there operating a voicebox. You 
will say to her : ‘My shoe pinches.’ 
She will say: ‘Everyone has trou- 
bles.’ She will take care of you 
from there.” 

Potter found his voice; “What 
am I supposed to do if she’s not 
there?” 

“Then go through the door be- 
hind her desk and out through 
the adjoining office into a rear 
hall. Turn left and go to the rear 
of the building. You will find 
there a man in a loader super- 
visor’s uniform, striped gray and 
black. When you find him, you 
will repeat the procedure with 
him.” 

“What about you?” Potter 
asked. 

“That is not your concern. 
Quickly, now!” 

The guide gave him a push 
that sent him hurtling forward. 

Potter stumbled toward the 
door just as a woman in a teach- 
er’s uniform emerged from the 



alley leading a file a children 
across between him and the bolt 
hole. 

Potter’s shocked senses took in 
the scene — children, all diessed 
in tight shorts that revealed their 
long flamingo legs. They were all 
around him suddenly and he was 
bulling his way through toward 
the door. 

Behind him, someone scream- 
ed. 

Potter lurched against the door, 
found the handle, turned and 
looked back. 

His guide had gone around to 
the opposite side of die fountain 
which concealed him now from 
the v/aist down, but what remain- 
ed visible was enough to make 
Potter gasp and freeze. The man’s 
chest was bare, revealing a single 
milky white dome from which 
blazed a searing light. 

Potter turned left and saw a 
line of men emerging from an- 
other alley to be crisped and 
burned down by that sear- 
ing light. The children were 
shouting, crying, falling back in- 
to the alley from which they had 
emerged, but Potter ignored 
them, fascinated by this slaught- 
er-machine which he’d thought 
was a human being. 

One of the guide’s arms lifted, 
pointed overhead. From the ex- 
tended fingers, lancets of searing 
blue stabbed upward. Where the 
light terminated, aircars tumbled 



78 



GALAXY 



from the sky. The air all around 
had become an ozone-crackling 
inferno punctuated by explosions, 
screams, hoarse shouts. 

Potter stood there watching, 
unable to move, forgetful of his 
instructions or the door or his 
hand upon the door’s handle. 

Return fire was coming now 
at the guide. His clothing shrivel- 
ed, vanished in smoke to reveal 
an armored body with muscles 
that had to be plasmeld fibers. 
The ravening beams continued 
to blaze from his hands and 
chest. 

■potter found he no longer could 
bear to watch. He wrenched 
the door open, stumbled through 
into the relative gloom of a yel- 
low-walled foyer. He slammed 
the door behind him as an explo- 
sion rocked the building. The 
door rattled. 

On his left, a door v/as flung 
open. A tiny blue-eyed blonde 
woman stood there staring at him. 
Potter found himself oddly 
recognizing the markers of her 
genetic cut, reassured by the 
touch of humanity in these tiny 
betrayals. He could see the cab- 
inet of a voicebox in the room 
behind her. 

“My shoe pinches,” Potter 
said. 

She gulped, “Everyone has 
troubles.” 

“I am Dr. Potter,” he said. ‘T 



think my escort has just been 
killed.” 

She stepped aside, said: “In 
here.” 

Potter lurched past her into 
an office with lines of empty 
desks. His mind was a turmoil. 
He felt shaken to his roots by 
the implications of the violence 
he had just witnessed. 

The woman took his arm, 
herded him toward another door. 
“Through here,” she said. “We’ll 
have to go into the service tubes. 
That’s the only way. They’ll have 
this place surrounded in min- 
utes.” 

Potter stopped, figuratively 
dug in his heels. He hadn’t 
counted on violence. He didn’t 
know what he had expected, but 
not that. 

“Where’re we going?” he de- 
manded. “Why do you want me?” 

“Don’t you know?” she asked. 

“He . never said.” 

“Everything’ll be explained,” 
she said. “Hurry.” 

“I don’t move a millimeter un- 
til you tell me,” he said. 

A raw street oath escaped her 
lips. She said: “If I must I must. 
You’re to implant the Durant 
embryo in its mother. It’s the 
only way we can get it out of 
here.” 

“In the mother?” 

“In the ancient way,” she said. 
“I know it’s disgusting, but it’s 
the only way. Now hurry!”

I'll the control center, their Sur- 

vey Globe, the Tuyere occu- 
pied the thrones on the pivoting 
triangle, reviewing data and re- 
viewing data — correlating, de- 
ducing, commanding. The 120- 
degree scan of curved wall avail- 
able to each of them flashed with 
data in numerous modes — pic- 
torially in the spying screens, as 
probability function in mathema- 
tical read-outs, as depth-module

In the upper quadrants, scan-

there were over a thousand this 
morning. 

Calapine worried the prescrip-

the abortive hum of power in it 
as she twisted and slid it along 
her skin. She felt restless, full 
of demands for which she could 
find no names. The duties of the

her companions hateful. In here. 
Time settled into more of a con- 
tinuous blur without days or

companion, merged, endlessly 
merged. 

“Once more have I studied 
the protein synthesis tape on the 
Durant embryo,” Nourse said. 
He glanced at Calapine in the 
reflector beside his head, drum- 
med the arm of his throne with 
fingers that moved back and 
forth on the carved plasmeld. 

“Something we’ve missed, 
something we’ve missed,” Cala- 
pine mocked. She looked at 
Schruille, caught him rubbing his 
hands along his robe at his thighs, 
a motion that seemed filled with 
stark betrayal of nervousness. 

“Now it happens I’ve discover- 
ed the thing we missed,” Nourse 
said. 

A movement of Schruille’s 
head caught Nourse’s attention. 
He turned. For a moment, they 
stared at each other in the prisms. 
Nourse found it interesting that 
Schruille betrayed a tiny skin 
blemish beside his nose. 

Odd, Nourse thought. How 
could one of us have a blemish 
such as that? Surely there, could 
be no enzymic imbalance. 

“Well, what is it?” Schruille 
demanded. 

“You’ve a blemish beside your 
nose,” Nourse said. 



80 



GALAXY 



chruille stared at him. 

“You deduce this from the 
embryo’s tape?” Calapine asked. 

“Eh? Oh . no, of course 
not.” 

“Then what is it you’ve dis- 
covered?” 

“Yes. Well ... it seems rather 
obvious now that the operation 
Potter performed may be repeat- 
able — given that general type 
of embryo and proper adminis- 
tration of sperm protamine.” 

Schruille shuddered. 

“Have you deduced the course 
of the operation?” Calapine ask- 
ed. 

“Not precisely, but iii outline, 
yes.” 

“Potter could repeat it?” she 
asked. 

“Perhaps even Svengaard.” 

“Guard and preserve us,” 
Calapine mfuttered. It was a 
ritual formula w<hose words sel- 
dom caught an Optiman’s con- 
scious attention, but she heard 
herself this time. The word “pre- 
serve” stood out as though out- 
lined in fire. 

She whirled away. 

“Where is Max?” Schruille 
asked. 

The whine in Schruille’s voice 
brought a sneer to Nourse’s lips. 

“Max is working,” Nourse 
said. “He is busy.” 

Schruille looked up at the 
watching scanners, thinking of all 
their fellows behind those lensed 



eyes — the Actionists seeing 
events as a new demand upon 
their talents, not realizing what 
violence might be unleashed 
here; the Emotionals, fearful and 
complaining, rendered almost in- 
effective by guilt feelings; the 
Cynics, interested by the new 
game (most of the watchers, 
Schruille felt, were Cynics) ; the 
Hedonists, angered by the cur- 
rent sense of urgent emergency, 
worried that such matters inter- 
fered with their enjoyments, and 
the Effetes, looking in all this 
for something new at which to 
sneer. 

Will we now develop 'a new 
party? Schruille asked himself. 
Will we now have the Brutals, all 
sensitivity immured by the needs 
of self preservation? Nourse and 
Calapine haven't faced this as 
yet. 

Again he shuddered. 

“Max calls,” Calapine said. “I 
have him in my transient 
screen.” 

Schruille and Nourse flicked 
their channel duplicators, looked 
down at Allgood’s swarthy, solid, 
muscular figure in the transient 
screen. 

“I report,” Allgood said. 

Calapine watched the Security 
chief’s face. He appeared oddly 
distracted, fearful. 

“What of Potter?” Nourse ask- 
ed. 

Allgood blinked. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



81 



“Why does he delay his an- 
swer?” Schruille asked. 

“It’s because he worships us,” 
Calapine said. 

“Worship is a product of fear,” 
Schruille said. “Perhaps there’s 
something he wishes to show us, 
a projection or an evidential sub- 
datum. Is that it. Max?” 

TV /Tax Allgood stared out of the 
screen, looking from one to 
the other. They’d gotten tied up 
in that lost-time sense again, the 
endless word play and disregard 
for Time in the quest for data, 
data, data — that side effect of 
endless life, the supra -involve- 
ment in trivia. This time, he 
hoped it would go on forever. 

“Where is Potter?” Nourse de- 
manded. 

Allgood swallowed. “Potter has 
. temporarily eluded us.” He 
knew better than to lie or evade. 

“Eluded?” Schruille asked. 

“How?” Nourse asked. 

“There was . violence,” All- 
good said. 

“Show us this violence,” Schru- 
ille said. 

“No,” Calapine said. “I will 
take Max’s word for it.” 

“Do you doubt Max?” Nourse 
a.sked. 

“No doubts,” Schruille said. 
“But I will see this violence.” 

“How can you?” Calapine 
asked. 

“Leave if you wish,” Schruille 



said. He measured out his words ; 
“I . will . see . this 
. violence.” He looked at All- 
good. “Max?” 

Allgood swallowed. This was 
a development he had not antici- 
pated. 

“It happened,” Nourse said. 
“We know that, Schruille.” 

“Of course it happened,” 
Schruille said. “I saw the mark 
where it was edited out of our 
channels. Violence. Now I wish 
to bypass the safety valve which 
protects our sensitivities.” He 
snorted. “Sensitivities!” 

Nourse stared at him, noting 
that all traces of a whine had 
gone from Schruille’s voice. 

Schruille looked up at the scan- 
ners, saw that many were wink- 
ing off. He was disgusting even 
the Cynics, no doubt, A few re- 
mained, though. 

Will they stay through to the 
end? he wondered. 

“Show the violence. Max,” 
Schruille ordered. 

Allgood shrugged. 

Nourse swiveled his throne 
around, putting his back to the 
screen. Calapine put her hands 
over her eyes. 

“As you command,” Allgood 
said. His face vanished from the 
screen, was replaced by a high 
view looking down into a tiny 
square between windowless build- 
ings. Two tiny figures walked 
around a fountain in the square. 



82 



GALAXY 



They stopped and a close-up 
showed the faces — Potter and 
an unknown, a strange looking 
man with frighteningly cold eyes. 

Again the long view. Two other 
men were emerging from an 
alley carrying paper-wrapped 
packages. Behind them trooped 
a file of children with an adult 
monitor in teacher’s uniform. 

Abruptly Potter was lurching, 
pushing through the children. His 
companion was running the other 
way around the fountain. 

Schruille risked a glance at 
Calapine, caught her peeking be- 
tween her fingers. 

li shrill, piercing cry from the 
screen brought his attention 
jerking back. 

Potter’s companion had be- 
come a thing of horror, clothing 
fallen away, a milky bulb arising 
from his chest to flare with bril- 
liant light. 

The screen went blank, came 
alive again to a view from a 
slightly different angle. 

A quick glance showed that 
Calapine had dropped all pre- 
tense of hiding her eyes, was star- 
ing at the screen. Nourse, too, 
v/atched through his shoulder 
prism. 

Another blaze of light leaped 
from the figure in the screen. 
Again the screen went blank. 

“It’s a Cyborg,” Schruille said. 
“Know that as you watch.” 



Again the scene came alive 
from a different angle and this 
time from very high. The action 
in the plasmeld canyon was re- 
duced to a movement of midges, 
but there was no difficulty in 
finding the center of violence. 
Lancets of blazing light leaped 
upward from a lurching figure in 
the square. Aircars exploded and 
fell from the sky in pieces. 

One Security vehicle plummet- 
ed in behind the Cyborg. A puls- 
ing beam of coherent light emerg- 
ed from it to cut a smoking 
furrow down the side of a build 
ing. The Cyborg whirled, lifted 
a hand from which a blinding 
blue finger seemed to extend in- 
to infinity. The finger met the 
diving car, split it in half. One 
half hit a building, ricocheted 
and smashed into the Cyborg. 

A ball of yellow brilliance took 
shape in the square. In a sec- 
ond, a reverberating explosion 
shook the scene. 

Schruille looked up to find tlie 
nSrr'io of watching scanners com- 
plete, every lensed eye blazing 
red. 

Calapine cleared her throat. 
“Potter went into that building 
on the right.” 

“Is that all you can say?” 
Schruille asked. 

Nourse swiveled his throne, 
glared at Schruille. 

“Was it not interesting?” 
Schruille asked. 



HEISENBERG'S EYES 



83 



“Interesting?” Nourse asked. 
“It is called warfare,” Schruille 
said. 

A llgood’s face reappeared on 
^ the screen, looking up at 
them with a veiled intensity. 

He’s naturally curious at our 
reaction, Schruille thought. 

“Do you know of our weapons. 
Max?” Schruille asked. 

“This talk of weapons and vio- 
lence disgusts me,” Nourse said. 
“What is the good of this?” 
“Why do we have weapons if 
they were not intended for use?” 
Schruille asked. “Do you know 
the answer. Max?” 

“I know of your weapons,” All- 
good said. “They are the ultimate 
safeguard for your persons.” 

“Of course we have weapons!” 
Nourse shouted. “But why must 
we . 

“Nourse, you demean your- 
self,” Calapine said. 

Nourse pushed himself back in 
his throne, hands gripping the 
arms. Demean myself! 

“Let us review this new de- 
velopment,” Schruille said. “Cy- 
borgs we knew existed. They 
have eluded us consistently. 
Thus, they control computer edit- 
ing channels and have sympathy 
among the Folk. Thus, we see, 
they have an Action Arm which 
can sacrifice ... I say sacrifice 
a member fcff the good of the 
whole.” 



Nourse stared at him, wide- 
eyed, drinking the words. 

“And we,” Schruille said, “we 
had forgotten how to be 
thoroughly brutal.” 

“Faaahl” Nourse barked. 

“If you injure a man with a 
weapon,” Schruille said, “which 
is the responsible party — the 
weapon or the one who wields 
it?” 

“Explain yourself,” Calapine 
whispered. 

^hruille pointed to Allgood in 
the screen. “There is our wea- 
pon. We’ve wielded it times with- 
out number until it learned to 
wield itself. We’ve not forgotten 
how to be brutal, we’ve merely 
forgotten that we are brutal.” 

“What rot!” Nourse said. 

“Look,” Schruille said. He 
pointed up to the watching scan- 
ners, every one of them alive. 
“There’s my evidence,” Schruille 
said. “When have so many watch- 
ed in the globe?” 

A few of the lights began to 
wink out, but came back as the 
channels were taken over by 
other watchers. 

Allgood watching from the 
screen felt the thrill of complete 
fascination. A tight sensation in 
his chest prevented deep breaths, 
but he ignored it. The Optimen 
facing violence! After a lifetime 
playing with euphemisms. All- 
good found the thought of this 
almost unacceptable. It had teen

so swift. But then these were the 
live-forevers, the people who 
could not fail. He wondered then 
at the thoughts which raced 
through their minds. 

Schruille, the usually silent 
and watchful, looked down at 
Allgood, said: “Who else has 
eluded us. Max?” 

Allgood found himself unable 
to speak. 

“The Durants are missing,” 
Schruille said. “Svengaard has 
not been found. Who else?” 

“No one, Schruille. No one.” 

“We want them captured,” 
Schruille said. 

“Of course, Schruille.” 

“Alive,” Calapine said. 

“Alive, Calapine?” Allgood 
asked. 

“If it’s possible,” Schruille 
said. 

Allgood nodded. “I obey, 
Schruille. 

“You may get back to your 
work now,” Schruille said. 

The screen went blank. 



Qchruille busied himself with 
the controls in the arm of his 
throne. 

“What’re you doing?” Nourse 
demanded and he heard the petu- 
lance in his own voice, despising 
it. 

“I remove the censors which 
excluded violence from our eyes 
except as a remote datum,” 
Schruille said. “It is really time 
that we observed the reality of 
our land.” 

Nourse sighed. “If you feel it’s 
necessary.” 

“I know it’s necessary.” 

“Most interesting,” Calapine 
said. 

Nourse looked at her. “What 
do you find interesting* in this 
obscenity?” 

“This exhilaration I feel,” she 
said. “It’s most interesting.” 

Nourse whirled away from her, 
glared at Schruille. He could see 
now that there definitely was a 
skin blemish on Schruille’s face 
— beside his nose.

T X 7hen Lieutenant Garret got 
’ ’ the summons from the Con- 
trol Room, his first thought was 
that the captain had died. What 
else could account for the ex- 
cited note in the ensign’s voice? 
He swung himself out of his 
berth, zipped through the passage 
and snapped: “What is it, Luis? 
Drug no good? Is the captain — ” 
Garcia looked at him so blank- 
ly that Garret bit off the end of 
his question. 

“Drug?” the boy repeated. He 
seemed almost dazed. “No, it’s 



They were infefligent and worthy 
of Man's respect. Too bad that 
they were a valuable commodityl 



not the skipper. I wanted per- 
mission to change course. You’ll 
think I’m crazy. Lieutenant, but 
so help me, we’re almost ram- 
ming an S-2. It’s hardly four de- 
grees off our course-vector.” 

“An S-2! We should be that 
lucky! The last was taken elev- 
en — no, fourteen years ago. You 
must be hallucinating, boy.” 
“That’s what I figured at first. 
But the sail began to show up 
on the micro-screen. A big one, 
if I’m not seeing things. Damned 
big.” 



86 



He heard the lieutenant whis- 
tle softly, and knew why. 

In 1870, a whaler — or beach- 
comber — who ' found a large 
chunk of that mysterious sub- 
stance, ambergris, was a fortu- 
nate fellow, sure to make a lot 
of money from his discovery. In 
2270, a comparable but even rar- 
er and more valuable windfall 
was the taking of an S-2, or Solar 
Sailor. 

The first had been spotted in 
2164. It knocked the world of 
science off balance for years to 
follow. The notion that any or- 
ganism could live and grow in 
airless, irradiated, non-temper- 
atured space was so novel and 
hard to accept that the crew of 
the Hakluyt were long called 
hoaxers, who with fake photos 
were amusing themselves at the 
public’s expense. 

However, after several more 
of the weird creatures had been 
seen, the evidence built up be- 
yond doubting. It was no longer 
possible to deny the truth. 

T he S-2, like the Portugese 
Man of War of Earth’s seas, 
consists of a jelly-like body from 
which sprouts a sail that reacts 
to the pressure of light. The or- 
ganism apparently lives by in- 
gesting cosmic dust much as 
whales utilize plankton. It can 
furl or twist its sail — something 
never observed, but inferred — 
PRICELESS POSSESSION 



but quite slowly, having no mus- 
cles as such, and so guides its 
movement in space. Obviously, 
it must avoid getting trapped in 
a strong gravitational field, since 
it could never escape, and would 
either crash on a planet or be 
immolated in a sun. Of necessity, 
it cruises only where the impact 
of photons against the sail do- 
minates the pull of matter. 

Since all attempts to commu- 
nicate with the organism were 
failures, the Galactic Council re- 
luctantly classified it as a lower 
animal of inconsiderable con- 
sciousness, and lawful game. 

As for the sail, the source of 
the creature’s commercial value, 
it is the most remarkable fabric 
to be found in the whole galaxy, 
and almost beyond price. Thin 
and light as the finest spider-silk, 
it is stronger than the toughest 
synthetics, from nylon-gamma to 
durette ; and can be cut only with 
power shears of concillium alloy. 
It is fireproof, waterproof and un- 
affected by any chemical reagent, 
however concentrated. It is also 
a near-perfect conductor of elec- 
tricity, having a resistance close 
to zero at all temperatures. Fi- 
nally, the material shimmers 
rainbowlike under radiation of 
every wavelength, from cosmic 
rays to the longest members of 
the AM band. Whether for the 
most precise instruments or tlie 
gowns of multimillionaire worn- 

87 



en, the fabric is so much in de- 
mand, and so scarce, that the 
price must be set by public 
auction. 

Every attempt at duplication 
in the laboratory failed; and it is 
thought that the missing factor 
may be time. It might take an 
S-2 a thousand years to grow its 
sail, one molecule at a time, un- 
der the rays of many classes of 
stars, in the hard vacuum of 
space — and such conditions 
aren’t to be simulated in any 
laboratory. 

The note of excitement in Al- 
varez’ voice was now accounted 
for. Aside from the basic drama 
of the find, the boy saw barriers 
dropping in all directions. He 
saw, too, in his mind’s eye, the 
lovely face of Julia Marlowe, 
whose father was a senior mem- 
ber of the Galactic Council, and 
not likely to let his daughter 
marry a penniless ensign. She 
was fond enough of the boy, ap- 
proving his darkly handsome face 
and muscular body; but she spent 
more on cosmetics and perfume 
than he earned. She was beauti- 
ful, gay, generous and sweet, but 
there was plenty of her father’s 
iron in the girl, and she would 
never settle down to live on love 
alone. 

But now that he was about to 
be one-third owner of a huge S-2 
sail . 

88 



arret had been studying the 
image on the screen, his pale, 
glittering eyes a glacial blue. 

“You’re right, by God — I 
didn’t believe it until this min- 
ute! Luis, do you know what that 
lovely beastie out there means to 
us?” 

The lieutenant knew what it 
meant to him, all right. He was 
over age in grade, and soon to 
be retired on the usual pittance. 
A first-rate fighting man, brave, 
quick-witted and up to every 
dirty dodge of battle, it was only 
his lack of self-control that kept 
him from climbing. Thick-set, 
blocky, with hot, intolerant eyes, 
he always preferred a blow to a 
word: tops in a messy brawl, but 
never seeing more than ten min- 
utes ahead. 

“Do I?” the ensign replied to 
Garret’s question. “It means 
about a million credits, at least — 
a three-way split. If the captain 
lives,” he added quickly. “And 
then I can ask Julia to marry 
me.” 

“Good for you,” the lieutenant 
said, only half-hearing. He was 
thinking what his own share 
would do. No more worry about 
living on his retirement pay, or 
taking some job that exploited 
his former rank and cluster of 
decorations. A life of luxury was 
now the prognosis: wine, women 
— he could do without song; the 
rustle of large denomination bills 

GALAXY 



was the most musical sound of 
all. 

“Well,” Alvarez said, grinning 
hugely. “What are we waiting 
for? They say a laser beam in 
that big bluish spot just off cen- 
ter kills the thing dead. And no 
risk of hurting the sail — as if 
anything could.” 

“Right. Move in now. We 
should be within range in an 
hour. The first in fourteen years,” 
he murmured gloatingly. “They 
may be practically extinct, even 
with the few taken. Or bunched 
up in some other galaxy; the ones 
captured here might be real 
wanderers.” He made some care- 
ful measurements with the mi- 
crometers, and said in an exul- 
tant voice: “I make the dimen- 
sions of this sail as giving five 
hundred square feet. And it 
should bring in a lot more than 
the last, because they’ve gone 
without so long. Million credits, 
hell — if this doesn’t net us twice 
that at the auction, I’ll eat the 
jelly part — no bread!” 

The ensign manipulated the 
controls, and the ship began to 
converge on the S-2. Then the 
captain’s voice, weak but lucid, 
came over the intercom. 

“Lieutenant Garret,” it said. 
“Please come to my quarters at 
once. Alvarez, too.” 

ttCay,” the boy said. “The new 

^ drug’s working. He sounds

fine. Kill or cure, the medicos 
said, and they were right. He’d 
be dead without it — you saw 
how bad he was.” 

“This is a lucky day all 
around,” the lieutenant said. 
“One quickie course in Medical 
Techniques, and you save the 
skipper’s life; not bad. Well, put 
the ship on auto again, and let’s 
go. This news ought to complete 
the cure.” 

When they came in. Captain 
Ling was struggling to a sitting 
position; his eyes were feverishly 
bright, and he panted. 

“There’s Something outside,” 
he gasped. “It’s been communi- 
cating with me — mentally.” 
They gaped at him. 

“What is?” the boy demanded. 
“An S-2,” the captain said. 
“Didn’t you spot it? What kind 
of a watch you two keeping while 
I — never mind. Maybe it’s still 
too far off. Anyhow, it was telling 
a friend. ‘I’m going to die soon; 
the Killers are near, and must 
have detected me. We can’t com- 
municate with them, and they 
always destroy us; I don’t know 
why. Good-by — ” I didn’t get 
the other’s name, if it has one. It 
was so far away . another gal- 
axy. I think. Yet they were in 
touch instantly.” 

“You’re hallucinating. Cap- 
tain.” Garrett said. “You know 
very well that nobody’s ever talk- 
ed to an S-2. They’re just space 

89 



jellyfish — lower animals. Weird 
and wonderful, but no more in- 
telligent than a worm.” 

Ling propped himself up, lips 
narroding. 

“Is there an S-2 out there or 
not?” 

“Yes, sir,” the lieutenant ad- 
mitted reluctantly. He gave the 
captain a lowering stare. “Tele- 
pathy is known to occur among 
humans. It’s not subject to con- 
trol, but does exist You must 
have caught some of my thoughts 
— or Luis’s. That has to be it.” 

Ling looked bewildered; he was 
still very ill, and not thinking 
clearly. He sank back in his bunk, 
breathing heavily. 

“Maybe you’re right, but we 
must be sure. Don’t kill it; you 
mustn’t. That’s an order,” he 
said, his voice hardening. 

“But, Captain,” his exec pro- 
tested. “The S-2 is officially 
classified as a lower animal, sub- 
ject to capture — legitimate 
game. Your order is actually il- 
legal. I don’t have to remind 
you, sir, what such a find is 
worth. Your share would be at 
least — ” 

“Never mind that,” Ling snap- 
ped. “I’m in command. Lieuten- 
ant. If an order’s illegal, you 
know the regulations; obey it, 
and complain later. I shouldn’t 
have to point that out to an of- 
ficer of your experience.” 

“But we’ll lose the thing!” 



Garret said angrily. “Maybe you 
don’t care, but I’m not passing 
up a fortune — one of the few a 
serviceman can get. Everything 
else the civvies latch on to, while 
we must settle for wages!” 

Ling’s eyes widened at Garret’s 
tone, but he merely said quiet- 
ly: “You can follow it for a while. 
Maybe I can make contact 
again.” 

“I’m sure it was the new drug. 
Captain,” Alvarez sugge.sted. 
“You were so far gone we took a 
chance on that new stuff — the 
psychic energizer. It gave you 
hallucinations.” 

( C T> ut it was all so clear — and 
logical.” Ling said, almost 
to himself. “They live very slow- 
ly compared to us, sailing from 
one universe to another — across 
those incredible gaps we haven’t 
dared to tackle yet. They avoid 
matter; maybe that’s why we’ve 
found so few. They daren’t get 
trapped by a gravity field. That 
small mass of theirs — it takes 
milennia to build up from cosmic 
dust down into usable food. Their 
thoughts are too sluggish for us, 
and their motions, too. They just 
can’t signal in time to ask our 
mercy. Helpless — it’s a terrible 
thing. If only I could slow my 
thinking down to match ... we 
can record speech, and run that 
at any speed, but thought . .” 
He closed his eyes. 



90 



GALAXY 



“Just how will you make con- 
tact, then?” Garret demanded 
sullenly. “We can’t follow it for- 
ever; we have a deadline of our 
own. Rigel III by next month, 
remember?” 

“I don’t know,” the captain 
admitted, without opening his 
eyes. “I’m all muddled up right 
now. Nothing’s coming through 
at the moment.” Then his lids 
snapped up. “There’s only one 
way, but it’s obvious enough. 
You’ll have to give me more of 
the new drug.” 

“But, Captain,” Alvarez ob- 
jected. “That’s risky. You were 
lucky once. Why push it?” 

“I have to. If that’s the stuff 
to stir up nerve endings or get 
them synchronized somehow with 
an S-2’s thoughts, I have to try 
it. I won’t have it on my con- 
science that I let a highly intel- 
ligent being get killed by my 
crew. And a noble being, too. If 
you could have felt its personal- 
ity! No hatred of us; a pure spir- 
it . .” 

“I’d be pure, too, just floating 
alone in space,” Garret said 
sourly. “But I have to live on 
Earth, and that costs money.” 

“You don’t know what you’re 
saying,” Ling said. “You’re not 
that callous. And there’s more. 
They can’t do anything; no or- 
gans for manipulation, but what 
minds! I could hear this one; he 
was building up a mathematical 
PRICELESS POSSESSION 



system. My specialty — and he 
lost me after the first five postu- 
lates! Think what we could learn! 
The theorem he was working to- 
wards would have unified elec- 
tricity, gravitation, magnetism, 
elasticity, the nucleus — sounds 
wild, but I believe. I really do 
believe!” 

“Not all math has practical 
significance,” Garret said. 

“Granted. But consider this 
one point. They’ve licked the 
communications problem. By 
some kind of thought exchange 
they converse over distances we 
can hardly conceive. When one 
buds — that’s how they repro- 
duce — the two drift apart for 
maybe fifty thousand years. The 
acceleration may be only .000001 
meters per second squared, but 
you know how that builds up 
the velocity in time — simple in- 
tegration. Yet father — and — 
call it ‘son’ — have no trouble 
talking across the void. Think 
how we need such a technique. 
Light’s too slow for anything out 
of the piddling solar system itself. 
And we’re stymied with it.” He 
sat up again, jaw out. “I don’t 
have to convince you, damn it. 
Ensign — give me the drug again : 
that’s an order!” 

There was no resisting the 
command, not in this navy. The 
boy looked at Garret, who scowl- 
ed, then shrugged.

■yT rhen the second dose had 
^ ' been injected, the two men 
waited impatiently for a reaction. 
It came more quickly this time. 

As soon as the captain began 
to recover, he said: “I’ll prove it 
to you. If I can receive from the 
S-2, it can receive from me. I’ll 
— I’ll ask it to signal.” 

“Captain, that’s crazy,” said 
Garret. “What kind of signal 
could it give? It can’t talk. It 
can’t shoot off flares . .” 

“I’ll ask it to furl its sail.” 
Garret hesitated. “We’ll 
watch,” he promised. 

And watch they did, for hours, 
while the prospect of the money 
began to grow larger in both their 
minds. 

“A million credits,” said Alva- 
rez. 

“More than that. Twice that 
much.” 

“And it’s all out there waiting 
for us. Can’t get away. ¥7onder if 
it’s smart enough to run anyway? 
Not that it could; you move 
pretty slow, sailing that way, with 
just a push from light-beams. It’s 
as good as ours, no matter what. 
Two million credits — ooh!” 
Then he gulped, staring at the 
micrometer dial, which was ze- 
roed in on the sail’s upper right- 
hand corner. “Oh, no!” 

“What?” the lieutenant barked, 
bringing his thoughts back from 
a pleasure-palace on Rigel II, 
where a little money bought de- 
92 



lights unknown on earth. 

“It’s furling! So help me God, 
it is — look! We’d better tell the 
captain right away.” 

He reached for the intercom, 
but Garret put a thick hand on 
his wrist. 

“Hold it a minute. We need to 
make sure. Give it more time — 
while we talk.” 

T)ut for many minutes they 
said nothing; just stared as 
the sail, curling very slowly, as 
a flower might, began to bring 
one corner down. After the mo- 
tion left no doubt, Alvarez stir- 
red restlessly; again the lieuten- 
ant restrained him. 

“Listen,” he said. “I’ll make 
this linear — not a curve. And 
strictly negative on the memory- 
cube. I’ll deny .saying it, offi- 
cially.” His dark face was grim. 
“All r'ght; the thing’s signalling; 
it has some sense. But it’s not 
human — not like us; just a 
damned jelly-fish. No matter 
what the Single Universe cloud- 
heads say, I don’t call every 
weird blob my brother just be- 
cause it knows the multiplication 
table! There’s a fortune out there 
a real life for us. Gonna let it 
get away?” 

“B — but,” the boy stammer- 
ed. “What about communication? 
That’s just as valuable. We could 
make a pile.” 

“We? Don’t be stupid! The lab 
GALAXY 



boys would have to work on the 
S-2 for years, maybe. And after 
they get the idea, how long to 
duplicate it? And who knows 
even if the drug would act the 
same on another guy? We could 
have long, gray beards before it’s 
all worked out — and still have 
no claim, either.” He gave the 
ensign a steady, cold stare. “I’ll 
talk to the captain; you back me 
— okay?” 

Alvarez hesitated briefly, then 
said: “Okay.” 

“Let’s go down; we can talk 
some more on the way.” 

They entered the cabin, and 
Ling peered at them. 

“Sick,” he mumbled. “Damned 
stuff hits my guts now.” He man- 
aged to sit up. “Well? What hap- 
pened? You must have seen it. 
The S-2 told me it had furled.” 

“I’m sorry, Captain,” Garret 
said, his face open and honest, 
gaze steady. “Nothing happened. 
We watched very closely. Not the 
slightest sign of a signal. In fact, 
the thing opened its sail further 
and was moving off our course — 
running away, obviously. Or try- 
ing to; but it’s just too slow. An 
animal reaction, I’d say. Lower 
animal escaping instinctively. 
You had hallucinations from that 
drug. Right, Alvarez?” 

His face pale, the boy said: 
“That’s right. Captain. No sign 
of any intelligent response. You 
must have dreamed up the whole 
PRICELESS POSSESSION 



exchange. It’s a pity,” he sighed. 

“I should have known,” Ling 
said bitterly, settling back in his 
bunk. “Some mighty good men 
tried to communicate — like Du- 
claux of the old Josiah Willard 
Gibbs — ^and couldn’t get through. 
Just a drug, after all. Well,” he 
said, looking at them owlishly, 
“I’ve held up your jackpot long 
enough. Go get your millions!” 
“Our jackpot,” Garret said. 
“And it’s a big one. Captain. Y our 
share will buy you that estate 
you’ve mentioned so often — 
that, and a whole lot more.” 
“I’d sooner have found what I 
thought was out there. But at 
least my conscience is clear.” 

/^utside the cabin, the two of- 
ficers exchanged glances. 
“His conscience is clear,” the 
lieutenant said. “And mine isn’t 
worth two-thirds of a million 
credits.” He put his hand on the 
boy’s shoulder. “Your people 
have a saying I like: “Take 
what you want — and pay for it.” 
“I know that one,” Alvarez 
said wryly. “My father uses it 
quite a bit. And then Mother 
tells him: ‘Ah, but when the bill 
finally comes, it may be too 
high.’” For a moment, as he 
spoke, his face, normally round 
and boyish, seemed old. 

“On the other hand, sometimes 
the bill never comes,” Garret 
said. —ARTHUR FORGES

LAWS of UTTER CHAOS 

'T'elegraph, telephone, radio, 
Kodak and Telstar have it 
in common that they are coined 
words, invented for the purpose 
of naming something that did not 
exist before, and most people 
know that they are coined words. 



for 



94 



But few are aware that the 
word “gas” is a coined word too, 
which differs from the others 
mainly in being much older, 
about three hundred and fifty 
years by now. No precise figure 
can be given because it is not 
known when it was coined. But 
we do know who coined it, name- 
ly the Flemish physician and ex- 
perimenter Jan Baptista van 
Helmont. He was born in Brus- 
sels, probably in 1577 and died 
at Vilvoorde, not far from his 
birthplace, probably in 1644. 

If Jan Baptista van Helmont 
had lived a century or two later, 
he would have been a greater 
scientist than he managed to be 
in his time. Van Helmont was a 
man of original ideas who made 
experiments never before per- 
formed, but he was handicapped 
by the general lack of chemical 
and physical knowledge of his 
time. One of van Helmont’s orig- 
inal experiments — he is half- jok- 
ingly referred to as the “father 
of hydroponics” because of it — 
was to plant a small willow tree 
in a soil-filled tub. The soil had 
been carefully weighed before it 
was placed in the tub and noth- 
ing was ever added to it but plain 
water. Five years later the tree 
had gained 164 pounds but the 
soil had lost only two ounces — 
at least that is how van Hel- 
mont’s figures translate into our 
system. A van Helmont of 1740 



or 1840 would then have started 
an investigation into what the 
plant had “eaten” during those 
five years; the actual van Hel- 
mont concluded that the water 
had “hardened” into wood and 
leaves and quickly retrogressed 
to early Greek philosophical 
speculation. 

But the tree-growing experi- 
ment was a side-issue. One of the 
investigations carried out by van 
Helmont dealt with a gas formed 
when wood was burned (our 
CO 2 ) and he came to the con- 
clusion that this was something 
different from air, though similar 
in many respects. Since Ihe nor- 
mal vocabulary had words only 
for solid and liquid substances 
but lacked a word for substances 
like air, he coined the word “gas”, 
from the Greek chaos the orig- 
inal meaning of which is “un- 
formed”. 

At first the wotxi gas was 
meant to be used for gases other 
than air (which, of course, was 
assumed to be homogeneous) but 
soon air was included. Unfortun- 
ately at a later date, say from 
1750 until well into the nine- 
teenth century, English-writing 
authors fell into the habit of 
writing “air” where we would 
say “gas”. Joseph Black called 
carbon dioxide “fixed air”, Henry 
Cavendish called hydrogen 
“flammable air” and others re- 
ferred to nitrogen as “dephlogis-

ticated air”. Van Helmont’s ac- 
complishment was all but forgot- 
ten for a while. 

His works were published af- 
ter his death (in 1644) under the 
overall title Ortus medicinae 
(The Garden of Health) since 
he considered himself mainly a 
physician. But he has to be men- 
tioned first when it comes to the 
exploration of the physical be- 
havior of gases, for he gave them 
their name. 

''T^he second man to be consid- 
ered was a botanist, though 



only later in his life. Born in 
Scotland on December 21, 1773 
the boy was baptized by his 
father (an Anglican parson) 
Robert Brown, and in time Rob- 
ert Brown began to study med- 
icine. He then joined the army 
as a medical officer but gradual- 
ly drifted into botany which was 
then closely allied to medicine. 

As a botanist he became fam- 
ous for discovering that every 
plant cell has a nucleus. In fact 
he invented the term, using the 
diminutive of nuca, the Latin 
word for “nut”. But much of his 



96 



GALAXY 



fame rests on another discovery, 
one that has absolutely nothing 
to do with botany, though Rob- 
ert Brown thought at first that 
it did. 

One day in 1827 he looked at 
pollen floating in water. With the 
aid of his microscope, which he 
probably used because he in- 
tended to identify the pollen by 
their size and shape, he saw that 
they were in steady motion. It 
was an irregular motion, not 
leading anywhere, but they 
would not hold still for a mo- 
ment. The fact that pollen be- 
haved like this when immersed 
in water was new and Brown 
looked for an explanation. It oc- 
curred to him quickly. 

Pollen grains, after all, were 
not dead matter. Fern or other 
plants would sprout from them 
in time. Since they were alive, 
the steady zig-zagging motion 
was caused by the “life force” 
which they harbored. 

To us this is no explanation at 
all but an expression of a mis- 
taken belief, but in 1827 it could 
still be advanced. It so happened 
that Brown, at a later date, ob- 
served the same kind of motion 
on particles of dye suspended in 
water. These particles certainly 
were not alive and never had 
been. Robert Brown dutifully re- 
ported his discovery in a scien- 
tific journal and admitted that 
he could not explain it. It is an 



interesting sidelight that Albert 
Einstein still wrestled with the 
mathematics of the explanation. 

Actually the explanation for 
the “Brownian motion”, as it 
came to be called was already ia 
existence at the time the discov- 
ery was made. Brown either did 
not know about it, or else did^ 
not believe it. It is also possible 
that he knew of the explanaticm 
but did not think that it applied 
to his observation. That explan- 
ation was the atomic theory of 
John Dalton, first announced in 
1803 and published with much 
detail in 1808. 

Dalton’s idea that all matter 
had to consist of atoms was an 
outgrowth of the belief held by 
Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac New- 
ton that gases had to consist of 
discrete _ particles. And both 
Boyle and Newton had been im- 
pressed by work done by the 
Italian Evangelista Torricelli. 
Since Torricelli lived from 1608 
to 1645, this brings us right back 
to the time of van Helmont, 
when most of the fundamental 
discoveries still had to be made. 

T7' vangelista Torricelli was thir- 
ty years of age when he read 
the works of Galileo Galilei. 
Needless to say that he was 
much impressed, as was every- 
body who actually read Galilei’s 
works, instead of just picking out 
a few sentences for the purpose 



FOR YOUR INFORAAATION 



97 



of disputing them. Four years 
later he went to the Villa Arcet- 
ri (near Florence) where Galileo 
Galilei was “imprisoned” and 
stayed on as secretary and com- 
panion to the old and blind man. 
Galilei died three months later. 
But during that time there had 
been a discussion between the 
two that led to the work that 
made Torricelli famous. 

Galilei still believed in the hor- 
ror Vacui, as it was then called, 
the notion that “Nature abhors 
a vacuum”. There was “proof” 
for this. If you dipped a tube 
into water and then pulled a pis- 
ton up the tube, the water rose 
in the tube. It could not stay be- 
hind, because in doing so a vac- 
uum would have been created 
and since Nature did not permit 
a. vacuum to exist, the water had 
to follow the piston. 

But ordinary engineering ex- 
perience, accumulated while 
building tall buildings, said that 
water could not be raised by 
more than 33 feet in this man- 
ner. Galileo Galilei suggested 
that Torricelli look into this 
problem. 

Torricelli did and began to 
reason. Powerful winds could 
topple trees, hence air could ex- 
ert a pressure. Wind pressure 
was a lateral phenomenon, but 
maybe air always exerted pres- 
sure downward. If so the pressure 
might only be enough to push 



water to a height of 33 feet, but 
not more. 

That happens to be inconven- 
iently large for easy experimen- 
tation; but there was a much 
heavier liquid known, namely 
mercury. Torricelli filled a bowl 
with mercury and then filled a 
glass tube, closed at one end, 
with the same metal. Then he 
turned the glass tube upside 
down and into the bowl of mer- 
cury. Some of the mercury 
promptly flowed from the tube 
info the bowl, but not very much. 
A column of mercury, 30 inches 
tall, remained in the glass tube. 

Evidently air pressure was 
equivalent to the weight of 30 
inches of mercury and the empty 
space above the mercury in the 
tube had to be that impossibility : 
a vacuum. 

It is called a Torricellian vac- 
uum to this day, even though it 
is not a very good vacuum be- 
cause it contains mercury vapor. 

This simple experiment pro- 
duced a scientific revolution. If 
the air could exert only so much 
pressure it meant that it had 
only so much weight. This, in 
turn, meant that the atmosphere 
had to have only a certain height 
— and the concept of the air 
ocean was born. Blaise Pascal in 
France began to think about it 
and reasoned that, if that were 
true, the air pressure on top of 
a high mountain should be less 



98 



GALAXY 



than the air pressure in the low- 
lands. Pascal lived in the Au- 
vergne and there was a mountain 
handy: the Puy-de-Dome. Since 
he was chronically sick the idea 
of climbing a mountain did not 
appeal to him — though the exer- 
cise might have done him a lot 
of good — and he charged his 
younger brother-in-law, one 
Monsieur Perier, with the task 
of carrying a Torricellian tube 
to the peak of the mountain. 
This was done in 1646 and it was 
found that the air pressure on 
top of the Puy-de-Dome (its 
height is 4790 feet) was ac- 
tually less by about six inches 
than at its foot. Knowing this 
one could try to calculate the 
depth of the air ocean, or the 
height of the atmosphere and it 
was Dr. Ekimond Halley in Eng- 
land who was one of the first to 
try to do so, proclaiming a three- 
layered atmosphere with a total 
height of 45 miles. 

One man who was much in- 
trigued by these findings was 
Otto von Guericke (1602-1686), 
Burgomaster of the city of 
Magdeburg. Intent on producing 
a vacuum he invented an air 
pump and in 1654, in Regens- 
burg, he gave the spectacular 
demonstration consisting of two 
teams of horses trying to pull 
apart a metallic sphere, consist- 
ing of two hemispheres, from 
v/hich the air had been evacuat- 



ed. Otto von Guericke carefully 
studied air pressure and when, 
on December 5, 1660 he found 
that the air pressure was unus- 
ually low he predicted a storm — 
which promptly happened the 
following day. 

"D obert Boyle, bom in Decem- 
ber 1627 at Lismore Castle, 
Ireland, was one of the many 
children of the Earl of Cork. He 
was just thirty years old when 
he heard of von Guericke’s air 
pump. He and his assistant, a 
then twenty-two year old young 
man by the name of Robert 
Hooke who later became Secre- 
tary of the Royal Society, tried 
to build a pump like von Guer- 
icke’s and ended up with a bet- 
ter one. 

Boyle knew, of course, that air 
can be compressed and he was 
interested in the relationship be- 
tween volume and pressure. To 
find out he built a kind of adap- 
tation of Torricelli’s tube, a tube 
in which gas could be com- 
pressed by the weight of mercury. 
If he started out with a given 
volume of air and then doubled 
the amount of mercury the air 
was compressed to half its orig- 
inal volume. 

As he put it in an appendix to 
his original publication (1662): 

“It is evident, that as common 
air, when reduced to half its

wonted extent, obtained near about 
twice as forcible a spring as it 
had before; so this thus comprest 
air being further thrust into this 
narrow room, obtained thereby a 
spring about as strong again as 
that it last had, and consequently 
four times as strong as that of the 
common air. And their is no cause 
to doubt, that if we had been here 
furnished with a greater quantity of 
quick-silver and a very strong 
tube, we might, by a further com- 



pression of the included air, have 
made it counterbalance the pressure 
of a far taller and heavier cylinder 
of mercury.” 

What later became known as 
“Boyle’s law” was simply the 
fact that tripling the pressure re- 
duced the volume to one third, 
quadrupling it reduced the vol- 
ume to one quarter and so forth. 
Boyle drew the logical conclu- 



100 



GALAXY 



sion: the air must consist of dis- 
crete particles with a vacuum be- 
tween them. If you exerted pres- 
sure you forced the particles to 
be closer to each other. 

With all his experiments 
about the “spring” of compressed 
air, Boyle lost sight of his orig- 
inal idea, namely to see whether 
a mercury column more than 30 
inches in height would be coun- 
terbalanced. And he never gave 
a single thought to temperature. 
It was the French physicist 
Edme Mariotte who realized that 
Boyle’s law held strictly true 
only if the temperature of the 
air did not change. Mariotte had 
learned that a volume of air 
expanded if the temperature in- 
creased and shrank if the tem- 
perature decreased — a discovery 
which finally led to the produc- 
tion of liquefied gases with all 
their numerous applications. As 
may be expected, Boyle’s law, in 
French textbooks, is “Mariotte’s 
law”, and I am voting on the 
side of the French. 

ir)y the year 1700, then, it had 
^ been established that air had 
weight, that a vacuum was pos- 
sible, that air could be artifi- 
cially compressed into a smaller 
space and, finally, that it expand- 
ed when heated and contracted 
when cooled and that all that 
only made sense if one assumed 
that it consisted of separate par- 



ticles. A solid, like lead, or a 
liquid, like water, did not seem 
to consist of separate particles 
since they could not be com- 
pressed. For a while, even after 
Mariotte, nobody noticed that a 
red-hot iron bar had a larger 
volume than a cold one. 

The next chapter in the his- 
tory of the gases is purely chem- 
ical. Jan Baptista van Helmont 
had discovered carbon dioxide, a 
gas other than air. Hydrogen was 
the next gas to be discovered. 
That there is a “flammable air” 
is first mentioned in the works 
of a Frenchman named Turquet 
de Mayerne — in the posthumous 
edition of his work, published in 
1702. But the early investigator 
of hydrogen — though he cannot 
be called its discoverer — was 
Henry Cavendish. He was bom 
in Nice on the Rivieria in 1731 
because his mother. Lady Anne 
Cavendish, had gone there for her 
health. Henry Cavendish attend- 
ed Cambridge University, but 
without obtaining a degree; he 
was interested in knowledge, not 
in degrees or titles. He also was 
a very strange man in all his 
habits. He could speak to only 
one person at a time and that 
only when that person was 
known to him and was male. 
Later in life he refused even to 
be in the same room with a wom- 
an and gave his instructions to 
his maids in writing. To round

out the picture he acquired two 
enormous inheritances from older 
relatives when he was himself 
over fifty: the fortunes were so 
large that the French physicist 
Jean Baptiste Biot called him: 
le plus riche de tous les savants 
et le plus Savant de tous les 
riches, which can be (inadequate- 
ly) translated as: “the richest of 
all the savants and the most 
knowledgeable of all the rich”. 
And since he used far less than 
the interest on his fortune, he 
died being the largest depositor 
in the Bank of England. 



Cavendish died at the age of 
seventy-nine — when he felt death 
approaching he sent his servants 
away so that he might die alone 
— and left a scientific legacy of 
work accomplished in astronomy, 
meteorology, metallurgy and a 
few other fields, but mainly 
chemistry. As for hydrogen, he 
had obtained it from metals by 
the action of acids, had carefully 
collected it over mercury and 
named it “flammable air from 
metals”. He not only knew that 
it was flammable, he knew that 
it was far lighter than air — there-

by establishing that different 
gases had different densities. He 
burned hydrogen, producing 
water and proved that way that 
water was not an element. 

It was already known that air 
consisted of at least two gases, 
nitrogen (discovered in 1772 by 
the Scottish physician Daniel 
Rutherford) and oxygen (discov- 
ered by Anton e Laurent Lavois- 
ier in 1774 or 1775), and Caven- 
dish found out that these two 
gases, merely mixed normally, 
could be forced into a chemical 
compound by the passage of 
electric sparks. 

But no matter how much oxy- 
gen he added to a sample of nit- 
rogen, there always remained a 
bubble that would not combine. 
It was argon, Cavendish missed 
an important discovery by a hair. 

These discoveries, plus a few 
others (like the one by the 
French chemist Joseph Louis 
Proust — 1754-1826 — that each 
chemical compound contains its 
elements in definite proportions) 
paved the way for John Dalton, 
who arrived at the conclusion 
that all matter, and not just gas- 
es, had to consist of atoms. Of 
course it was thought at first that 
only two atoms would get to- 
gether for the simpler com- 
pounds. The “fixed air” of Jo- 
seph Black was thought to have 
the formula CO (instead of 
CO 2 ), and water was be- 



lieved to be HO (instead 
of H 2 O). But even so it was im- 
practical to talk about an “atom” 
of water, or a “compound atom” 
as some phrased it. It was Count 
Amadeo Avogadro (1776-1856) 
who coined the term molecule, 
the meaning being “small bun- 
dle”. He also suggested that even 
the elements came in molecules, 
containing more than one atom 
as a rule. 

Strangely enough the atomic 
theory of Dalton, which consti- 
tuted a scientific revolution, was 
accepted quietly — while Avog- 
adro’s idea of molecules, which 
was merely a refinement, caused 
violent opposition. 

A fter this interlude, during 

^ which gases were treated 
mainly as chemicals, physics be- 
gan to reassert itself. The turn- 
ing point was around the middle 
of the nineteenth century. 

An important point was that 
both Avogadro and Andre Marie 
Ampere (1775-1836) had inde- 
pendently arrived at the con- 
clusion that a given volume of a 
gas, at a given temperature, 
would contain the same number 
of atoms (molecules) regardless 
of the nature of the gas. Natxmal- 
ly, that brought up the question; 
how many? 

Again we have to backtrack.

tor of the hydrogen-filled bal- 
loon, had discovered in 1787 that 
gases shrank at a definite rate 
when cooled. For each degree 
centigrade of heat they lost, they 
also lost one 273 part of the vol- 
ume. If this rule held true all 
the way, they should have no 
volume at aU at a temperature 
of minus 273° centigrade. A long 
time later, in 1848, Lord Kelvin 
(born William Thompson, 1824- 
1907) went back to this discov- 
ery, suggesting that at minus 
273° centigrade the gas might 



have lost all of its energy, not its 
volume, and that this temper- 
ature should be used as a start- 
ing point for a temperature scale 
that avoided the nuisance of “be- 
low zero” degrees. 

From then on things moved 
fast. In 1857 the German phys- 
icist Rudolph Clausius (1822- 
1888) invented a new concept. A. 
gas, he said, consists of “atoms” 
in steady motion, flying in all 
directions. Hence they must col- 
lide quite often. But while the 
distance between collisions would 



104 



GALAXY 



not be the same, there should be 
an average distance between 
collisions, that average distance 
depending on both density and 
temperature. This average dis- 
tance is now known in English 
as the “mean free path”. In 1860 
the Scottish mathematician 
James Clark Maxwell (1831- 
1879) began to think about these 
problems. Maxwell felt that even 
for a given temperature the 
speed of the molecules would not 
be uniform. Some would move 
faster than the norm, and others 
more slowly; and it was only the 
average of these different veloc- 
ities that corresponded to the 
temperature. Raise the temper- 
ature and you get a higher aver- 
age molecular velocity, but a 
specific molecule might move at 
a rate corresponding to a tem- 
perature twenty degrees lower. 
While Maxwell, sitting in Cam- 
bridge, pursued these thoughts, 
Ludwig Boltzmann (1884-1906), 
professor at the University of 
Vienna, conceived the same idea. 
Consequently the kinetic theory 
of gases that emerged from their 
separate goosequills was later 
referred to as the MaxweU- 
Boltzmann theory. 

The theory contained the ex- 
planation of Brownian motion. 

We can’t see the molecules as 
they move and collide, but if we 
have a body small enough to be 
kicked around by them, and 



large to be visible in the micro- 
scope, we see “Brownian mo- 
tion”. That it was first observed 
in water was an accident, but 
the explanation is the same. 

But we still have not answered 
the earlier question how many 
gas molecules are there in a given 
volume. It was Joseph Loschmidt 
(1821-1895), also of the Univer- 
sity of Vienna, who tackled the 
problem. Publication of his re- 
sults took the form of a lecture 
delivered during the Twenty-Sec- 
ond Session of the Imperial Ac- 
ademy of Science in Vienna on 
October 12, 1865. The lecture 
had the somewhat surprising 
title: “On the Size of Air Mole- 
cules”. Loschmidt explained that 
he used this term because the 
difference in weight of oxygen 
and nitrogen molecules is minor, 
so that they could be averaged to 
hypothetical air molecules. Now, 
he said, we are dealing with three 
values. One is the number of 
molecules per cubic centimeter — 
this we’ll call N. Then we have 
the length of the mean free path, 
which we’ll call L. And finally 
we have the diameter of the mol- 
ecule which we’ll call D. L. will 
be shorter as the values for N 
and for D become larger. 

S o far everything was quite 
• clear. If the number of mol- 
ecules per unit volume is larger, 
there will be more collisions. But 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



105 



there will also be more collisions 
if the molecules themselves are 
larger. Hence his main interest 
was in the size of the molecules; 
all else would follow from that. 

Maxwell had calculated that 
the mean free path for a nitrogen 
molecule would be (at 15° centi- 
grade) 1/447,000 inch, equiva- 
lent to 6/100,000 millimeters. 
(We now know that the value is 
around 9/100,000 millimeter.) 
Loschmidt thought that Max- 
well’s figure was a bit too small 
so he picked 14/100,000 which is 
too large. 

So each moving molecule 
moves through a volume of space 
which is cylindrical with the 
length of the cylinder being L, 
or Maxwell’s “corrected” figure, 
while the diameter of this cylin- 
der is equal to the still unknown 
diameter D of the molecule. 

Trying to determine D, Losch- 
midt assumed that the molecules 
in a liquefied gas touch each 
other. This was quite a simplifi- 
cation, and even if the molecules 
were strictly spherical and 
touched each other there would 
still be 26 per cent of the total 
volume that would be empty. 

Just to corriplicate matters, it 
was still impossible to liquefy 
air at the time Loschmidt lec- 
tured. Hence he could not know 
the volume occupied by one 
gram of liquefied air. He as- 
sumed a value by comparison 



with those gases that could be 
liquefied in his day. 

He concluded that the diamet- 
er of an air molecule was just 
slightly less, by three per cent, 
than one millionth of a millimet- 
er. This, he said, was not a cor- 
rect value but he felt sure that 
it was “neither ten times too 
large nor ten times to small.” In 
that he was correct; his value 
was only three times too large. 

Strangely enough he did not 
take the step to calculate the 
number of molecules in a cubic 
centimeter of air, but following 
his method that figure comes out 
as 1,800,000,000„000,000,000 per 
cubic centimeter. But Loschmidt 
had overestimated both the size 
of the molecule and the length of 
the mean free path ; the true 
number of molecules per cubic 
centimeters is 15 times as large. 

Usually this is called Avoga- 
dro’s number. In order to honor 
Loschmidt for his pioneering ef- 
fort the number of molecules 
per mol (the quantity of com- 
pound weighing as many grams 
as its molecular weight, or 32 
grams in the case of oxygen) is 
called “Loschmidt’s number”, 
although he did not calculate it. 

That writers, even of textbooks, 
sometimes call Loschmidt’s num- 
ber Avogadro’s number is sad, 
but true. Just console yourself 
with the thought that “gas” 
means “chaos”! WILLY LEY

Qnowblindness stalked him like 
a spectral white bear. 
Through his arctic sunglasses, 
Dr. Joe West’s eyes winced. 
His forehead ached from the 
penetrating white glare. 

Across the dazzling ice, sha- 
dow-shapes of children and 
squatty men romped on all 



fours. They were pretending to 
be bears, roaring and giggling 
as the bears devoured the chil- 
dren. Watching from their sum- 
mer parkas with hoods turned 
back, the horde of swollen 
women exposed their squinting 
babies to the arctic sun. 

It had been three days since 
the event, the birth. 

For two days since Dr. West 



107 



concluded these people could 
not be Eskimos, he had been 
trying to leave. Escape still 
seemed to be too strong a word 
to use. 

“Today we go,” Dr West said 
(asked). 

“Soon-soon we go,” Edward- 
luk agreed pleasantly; his was 
the only dog team in the en- 
campment, only seven dogs and 
over a hundred Eskimos. “Soon 
as this person’s leg is better.” 
“Your leg is better. Last 
sleep.” Dr. West squinted down 
at his stethoscope, which dan- 
gled from Edwardluk’s thick 
neck, “I gave you my heart- 
ears, and you said your leg felt 
better. You said we would go 
today.” 

“Eh-eh,” Edwardluk laughed, 
politely agreeing with whatever 
the whiteman was saying, “leg 
is better than yesterday. Eh-eh, 
you are better. Each day you 
like us better. Tomorrow you 
like us better still.” 

“I like you now,” Dr. West 
tried to restrain the irritation 
in his voice. “As soon as we 
travel to the whitemen, I’ll tell 
them how much you helped me. 
As I’ve been telling you, the 
airplanes will drop much food 
for this camp. We must go!” 
“Eh-eh,” Edwardluk sud- 
denly seemed to agree with en- 
thusiasm. “Soon as we kill seals 
to feed dogs, we go!” 



ITdwardluk trotted toward his 
tent, and Dr. West followed 
with long strides, unable to be- 
lieve this sudden activity. 

“First we fill our bellies.” Ed- 
wardluk flopped down on an an- 
cient sealskin and shouted im- 
pressively for his wife to cut 
meat, of which there was lit- 
tle, although the Canadian Cul- 
tural Sanctuary Commission 
had re-stocked the Boothia Dis- 
trict with twin-birth seals. 
“Then we sleep.” 

“But now is our chance to 
hunt seals,” Dr. West protested, 
pointing with his recoilless rifle 
toward the shore-ice where a 
crack had opened, where seals 
could rise. 

“Hunt seals,” Edwardluk 
agreed like an echo and added 
helpfully; “Good dream protect 
us from bad ice. Good dream 
help you like us better tomor- 
row.” With downcast eyes, Ed- 
wardluk smiled like a shy little 
boy and handed Dr. West a 
thawing glob of seal liver as if 
it were a Valentine. “Best piece 
for you.” 

Edwardluk’s smiling eyes 
narrowed as his massive jaw 
crunched through the partial- 
ly frozen meat. Gulping, he swal- 
lowed and crunched and gulped. 
His eyes closed with pure joy. 
His head sagged down. As eas- 
ily as a tired child, he slept. 

Dr. West’s strong young hands 



108 



GALAXY 



tightened on his recoilless rifle. 
These people are so obliging, 
so innocent, so damned lovable, 
it would be imfwssible to shoot. 
Damn! Damn, damn, damn! 

If I am a prisoner, he thought, 
I can escape. I can esdape when- 
ever I chose to use — threaten 
to use force. 

Dr. West’s contradictory grin, 
which also made him attractive 
to women who were more selec- 
tive than Eskimo women, his un- 
certain grin cracked his chapped 
lips. If I am a prisoner, his 
thoughts echoed, I can esdape. 
If I am NOT a prisoner, by 
definition I cannot escape. 

Damn! That’s a neurotic 
thought. I’ve got to escape. 

He stared down at the scrap 
of meat which attracted flies to 
Edwardluk’s small hand. These 
people lacked the gargantuan 
appetites of Eskimos. Also con- 
trary to Eskimos, there were 
too many small children. More 
than the environment could sup- 
port. The disproportionate num- 
ber of children indicated a rapid 
increase in population. After 36 
days with these people. Dr. West 
had written down too many ob- 
servations. What he observed 
three nights ago was the abso- 
lute end. 

If I don’t leave now, I may 
never leave. Grinning, grimacing, 
he shook his head. Damn! Got 
to escape. 

THE ESKIMO INVASION 



TTe glanced from the snoring 
Edwardluk to the sleeping 
dogs. Yesterday when he tried 
to order these people to help him 
prepare a sled, giggling they had 
diverted him from leaving. Mar- 
thalik had rubbed urgently 
against him, peeping up with 
sweet narrow eyes, urging him 
to come back into the tent duck- 
ing imder his waving arms of 
anger. He felt trapped. 

In her hood the wrinkled face 
erf the baby had flopped back 
and forth, and begun to cry. 
From Dr. West’s inexplicable 
rage, the people had averted their 
faces like hurt children, and his 
determination to use force, to 
seize a sled and a prisoner had 
dissolved in embarrassment, re- 
morse, a dark tent and gentle 
whispering with Marthalik. Yes- 
terday. Today. 

In the white glare his eyelids 
itched. Dr. West knew if he was 
going to travel he should al- 
ready have left. These women, 
these incredibly wonderful wom- 
en. I’ve got to escape now! Sim- 
ultaneously, he felt like laugh- 
ing and crying. 

Beyond the shore-ice and the 
dark crack, gleamed the veined 
sea-ice with distant islands glit- 
tering, icebergs. God help me! I 
have to cross that! He knew the 
Canadian Cultural Sanctuary 
Guard Post must be somewhere 
beyond that glowing horizon. 



10P 



Five years ago during his Alas- 
kan Eskimo population survey 
Dr. West had learned how diffi- 
cult it was for a Kabloona, a 
whiteman, to handle Eskimo 
dogs, but he had done it. I can 
do it now if the dogs are har- 
nessed to the sled. 

Flies buzzed above Edward- 
luk’s sleeping smile, and his mas- 
sive jaw moved. He was dream- 
ing. These people, Marthalik, all 
of them, Dr. West had noticed 
how animated their faces were 
when they slept, as if their 
dreams were reality. 

But reality to Dr. West was 
burning eyelids and the shock 
of the 33rd night. Got to es- 
cape. Must outsmart Edwardluk. 



Quietly, Dr. West rolled up 
his sleeping bag. He slid his 
arm through the sling of his re- 
coilless rifle, the only rifle in 
the encampment since the disap- 
pearance of Edwardluk’s “broth- 
er”, who had owned a rusty 
rifle and a rusty personality to 
match, and seemed more like a 
real Eskimo with his boasting 
and scratching. He had been 
troubled by lice. 

But these people had no lice. 
These people had no tuberculosis. 
They were not Eskimos. 

II 

T^r. West hefted his pack. 

Heavy-laden he started the 



no 



GALAXY 



long walk across the ice toward 
the distant icebergs in the polar 
gulf. He hoped he was setting 
a trap for Edwardluk. 

Dr. West’s original intention 
liad been to take one of these re- 
markable people back with him, 
and there w/as still that possibili- 
ty, that possibility — 

With each step, the silicone 
rubber membranes in Dr. West’s 
boots exhaled fog. Yet he waded 
with dry feet through shimmer- 
ing puddles of melt-water across 
the thawing sea-ice. Like a giant, 
he strode over eroding stream- 
beds on the ice. Fresh water 
trickled toward dark leads where 
the sea surged, where seals could 
rise. 



This summer ice was rotting, 
dangerous. He opened the vents 
in his outer parka because to 
perspire also was dangerous. 
“Bad, bad-bad,” Edwardluk had 
said, “for whiteman to walk 
alone on sea-ice.” 

Then you come rescue me, Dr. 
West thought and walked on and 
on. 

The icebergs seemed no closer, 
but when Dr. West looked back 
he saw that the encampment had 
miniaturized into a cluster of 
dots. 

Like a midget, a midge, a dark 
speck. Dr. West plodded end- 
lessly across the flat sea-ice. He 
hoped Edwardluk was watching, 
massive jaw beginning to sag with

m 



worry. Dr. West was gambling, 
possibfy his life, that Ekiwardluk 
would grunt with decision, hitch 
the dogs to the sled and come 
out from that cluster of specks. 

CtT)iggest ’skimo camp ever!” 
the nervous bush pilot had 
marveled when he set Dr. West 
down on the ice 36 days ago. 
“Where’d they all come from? 
Out you go. Dr. No-Name. Can’t 
risk me license, even for all those 
plump little reasons waving to 
me out there. Got to take off.” 
The expatriate Englishman’s gaze 
had swept the vast aretic sky. 
“Cultural Sanctuary’s patrol air- 
craft’s likely airborne now, and 
hot after our vanished radar blip. 
Serious charges, landing on the 
Boothia Peninsula. Got to take 
off. Me aircraft’s me life!” 

The self-taught pilot, an ex- 
R.A.F. ground crewman, had not 
reappeared in two weeks as prom- 
ised, or in three weeks, or in 
four weeks. Crashed, Dr. West 
suspected. If radar-tracked and 
arrested, the pilot would have 
blabbed by now, and a Cultural 
Sanctuary patrol plane would 
have swooped low, searching for 
Dr. West. 

Dr. West’s application for a 
Landing Permit had been denied 
by the Cultural Sanctuary Com- 
mission in Ottawa. Not even 
Overflight Permits were being 
granted anywhere near the North 



Magnetic Pole. Dr. West sus- 
pected that politics or profession- 
al jealousy was behind the re- 
fusal. Perhaps the ethnological 
bigwigs at McGill University 
wanted first look at the ru- 
mored population increase but 
hadn’t got around to it yet. 
Surely they didn’t think Dr. Jo- 
seph West, former Director of 
Oriental Population Problems 
Research at the University of 
California, now unemployed, had 
become a smuggler of transistor 
radios and steel tools which 
could culturally dislocate the 
Boothia Eskimos. There was lit- 
tle evidence of recent cultural 
smuggling to these people. 

Dr. West shook his head. If 
what he had observed continued, 
these people were more apt to 
dislocate the world than vice- 
versa. 

His pack-straps sawed into his 
shoulders. His feet plodded on 
and on across the sea-ice. He 
squinted at the sky, although he 
had given up all hope of being 
arrested, rescued by a Cultural 
Sanctuary aircraft. The only way 
of carrying his warning message 
to the Outside seemed to b^ 
through hopeful physical exer- 
tion, plus guile if Edwardluk fell 
into his trap. 

A bove the peak of the iceberg, 
a flock of dark fulmars 
whirled. Around the berg gleam- 



112 



GALAXY 



ed broken ice and dark water 
where sea birds could feed. Dr. 
West w!as surprised that he did 
not sight a single seal as he cir- 
cled behind the berg. 

Now he was out of view from 
the camp. Dr. West hoped Ed- 
wardluk was harnessing the dogs. 
If his friendship talk was gen- 
uine, he’ll come to rescue me. If 
not, he’ll come to recapture me. 
But there was a third possibility, 
unfortunately. Edwardluk might 
simply go to sleep — because he 
didn’t give a damn. 

From his pack, Dr. West took 
out a pad of caribou skin and 
sat down. Rifle propped against 
his thigh, he waited. The trap 
was set for Edwardluk. And 
waited. 

Cold rose through the ancient 
caribou skin pad into Joe West’s 
haunches. Restlessly, he remem- 
bered his Alaskan Eskimos had 
used bear skin pads because they 
were thicker. But these Boothia 
people owned no polar bear skins. 
They said they never killed their 
father-bear, and Dr. West was 
inclined to believe them. 

The cold enfolded him. From 
the corner of his eye a small 
part of the white background 
trotted across his field of vision. 
It was an arctic fox, plume-tailed 
and oblivious. 

Suddenly the white fox stared 
at him or past him. Dr. West 
felt a creeping urge to look be- 



hind his own back. He remem- 
bered that the Eskimos refer to 
the white fox as the bear’s dog. 
On the sea-ice, the fox follows 
the polar bear, dependent on the 
bear’s kills. The Eskimos say: 
“Fox on ice, look behind you 
quick, is bear.” 

Turning his head Dr. West 
squinted at each white mound 
and fuzzy shadow. At point blank 
range, he knew a piolar bear 
would appear more cream-col- 
ored than the ice. A black spot 
would be the nose of the polar 
bear. The Eskimos say: “Bear 
hold white paw over nose, bear 
gone, eh-eh. Bear still there.” 
“Ha!” Dr. West shouted, 
standing up. The immense white 
backgroimd remained immobile. 
From the white mounds, a polar 
bear’s head did not rise weasel - 
like on its long neck. 

“Spooked myself. These peo- 
ple talk too much about bears.” 
Dr. West twisted his chilled face 
in another grin. He didn’t want 
to remember Edwardluk’s wide- 
eyed face above the seal oil 
lamp. 

T ike Eskimos, these people en- 
^ tertained themselves with 
night stories. Thick neck tilting 
from side to side, his eyes clos- 
ing in ecstasy, Edwardluk had 
grunted like a bear. “Grandfath- 
er of the sky!” Edwardluk’s sud- 
denly hoarse voice had creaked. 



THE ESKIMO INVASION

“Sharpen your hvinger. We — 
your children — prepare for you. 
Open your jaws!” 

Dr. West blinked his eyes and 
shivered. If their grandfather was 
a bear-spirit, that was all right 
with Dr. West. Who was he to 
deride anyone’s totems or reli- 
gious beliefs? But after 36 days, 
what grated his nerves was the 
continuously nonanthropomor- 
phic theology of their night sto- 
ries. These people had things 
backward, he thought. 

The mythology of other Es- 
kimos, real Eskimos, presented 
bear-spirits as merely helping 
or hmdering man. Man was the 
end -purpose. 

But in these people’s stories 
the bear seemed the end-purpose. 
The People helped the bear. The 
People prepared the seals, the 
rocks, the airplanes, for the bear. 
This was not the bear on the 
ice. This was a bear in the sky. 
The purpose of all life seemed 
to funnel into the bear. 

What their bear symbolized. 
Dr. West had not found out, 
but he had had enough exper- 
ience with real bears to suspect 
that a hungry polar bear makes 
little distinction between a prone 
man and a seal. He remained 
standing, clutching his rifle. The 
non-appearance of seals in the 
open water around this iceberg 
suggested that a real bear was 
near. 



Dr. West’s eyes watered with 
the strain of trying to see every- 
thing and distinguishing less and 
less in the white glow of the 
ice. The cold soaked up through 
his feet His leg bones became 
conductors of the cold. Some- 
times he stood motionless, for- 
getting to stamp his feet. His 
vision and time blurred. 

The fulmars cried out in alarm 
and whirled dark wings upward 
into the sky, and Dr. West’s 
eyes widened. He turned. He 
laughed with relief. A line of 
black specks across the ice be- 
came dogs pulling a distant sled. 

Dr. West sat down on his 
caribou skin pad, but his heart 
was thudding with suppressed 
excitement, and he stood up. 
Peering, suddenly he cursed. 

'"T^here was more than one man 
-*■ approaching. A man trotted 
ahead of the sled. The dark 
bulge on the sled was a second 
man, probably Edwardluk. Far 
behind, a third man plodded over 
the ice. 

Three men were more than 
Dr. West had bargained for, even 
though he had the only gun. 

By the time they were close 
Dr. West still had not decided 
what to do. 

“He was watching you!” Ed- 
wardluk shouted happily. “Up 
there he was watching you.” 

Dr. West stared up at the peak 



114 



GALAXY 



of the iceberg. If Edwardluk 
was referring to an actual bear, 
it was invisible to Dr. West. He 
squinted at the dogs, who lay 
down; they had not scented a 
bear. 

“Seen us coming.” Edwardluk 
made a circling motion with his 
wide face and stubby nose, and 
Dr. West supposed the bear had 
circled out of sight behind the 
berg. 

“We come to carry back your 
seals,” Edwardluk said innocent- 
ly- 

The second man stood smiling 
at the sky. The third man still 
was approaching. They seemed 
unarmed. In their fur parkas they 
reminded Dr. West of three 
childhood teddy-bears. They had 
been kind and hospitable to Dr. 
West, and now he couldn’t quite 
bring himself to point the rifle. 
He didn’t want to threaten them 
with harsh words which would 
bring hurt expressions to their 
child-like faces. He didn’t want 
to kidnap a prisoner. 

Swiftly he rationalized that it 
might be dangerous to take a 
prisoner. The prisoner might 
chew through his bonds while 
Dr. West slept. Let some anony- 
mous expedition seize the first 
laboratory specimen. 

“There is a dead seal under 
the edge of the ice,” Dr. West 
blurted, pointing with his rifle 
barrel and walking behind their 



backs to the sled. Their har- 
poons still were lashed to the 
sled. 

“Eh-eh,” Edwardluk’s voice 
agreed politely to the lie. “There 
is a seal but my eyes don’t see it 
yet.” 

Dr. West’s shivering hands 
were tying his pack and sleeping 
bag on the sled. 

“Hal” Dr. West shouted at the 
dogs as he flopped on the sled, 
and to his surprise and relief the 
dogs lurched forward before he 
could use the whip. They dashed 
past the startled face of the 
third man. Back to camp was 
where the dogs were hurrying. 
Slashing the whip with all his 
strength. Dr. West manged to 
turn the leader toward the ice 
horizon. 

'"T^he sled passed in an arc 
through the shouting range of 
the running men, but Dr. West 
managed to whip the dogs away, 
the sled weaving a snakelike 
course beyond the iceberg with 
Edwardluk running far behind. 

I have escaped. Dr. West 
thought inaccurately. 

The terrible global significance 
of what he had observed about 
these people he had not fully an- 
alyzed. Mainly he was fleeing 
from what happened on the 33rd 
night, and from his contradic-

He clung to the sled undulat- 
ing over the ice. The wonder of 
the 33rd night. The dogs were 
running uncontrollably. The 
shock of the 33rd night. The sled 
bounced over a pressure ridge. 
The women — 

If he let go he would fall 
off the sled and go back. He 
laughed with bewilderment. It 
- was these women who would be 
too much for the world. 

Dr. West’s only intimate ex- 
perience with women had been 
limited to a high school girl a 
year older than he but equally 
flustered, several indistinct sor- 
ority girls who might have been 
the same girl several times, four 
or five student nurses when he 
was in Med school, including one 
he vividly remembered plump 
and unadorned in unexpected 
glory, six or seven lab techni- 
cians, the last leaving him un- 
bearably guilty and resolving to 
give up sex, followed by a tired 
old waitress in Cambridge, Mass., 
a dozen sprightly R.N.’s and 
doctor-chasers, the hospital ad- 
ministrator’s fiancee who laughed 
when he asked her to take him 
seriously, followed by a tired old 
cocktail waitress in Berkeley, 
California, paralleling the story 
of his life, earnest female grad- 
uate students at U.C. in Pub- 
lic Health, Anthropology and 
Genetics, a gorgeous Ph.D. in 
Population Statistics who for un- 



statistical reasons decided against 
marriage, followed by his popu- 
lation research expedition to the 
Alaskan tundra and a giggling 
Eskimo woman of whom the only 
thing memorable was her aroma, 
the same gorgeous Ph.D., telling 
him that his theory of Arctic 
Human Ecology should be rec- 
ognized beyond the scientific 
community and he should be- 
come more 'assertive, which he 
was to an arch-eyebrowed inter- 
viewer from McCalTs Magazine 
and a round-eyed interviewer 
from Good Housekeeping who 
kept calling him a boy-wonder, 
and the same gorgeous Ph.D. 
congratulating him in the nicest 
way that she could for his ap- 
pointment as the Director of 
Oriental Populations Problems 
Research at the University of 
California, a period of overwork, 
the same gorgeous Ph.D. com- 
miserating him for being un- 
expectedly ousted as Director by 
that determiner of all large re- 
search grants, the Secretary of 
Defense, followed by a tired old 
barmaid in Moosejaw Saskatch- 
wan and a» unscheduled airline 
stewardess in Coppermine, 
Northwest Territories, five hun- 
dred forbidden air miles from 
the Boothia Peninsula. 

These remarkable women on 
the Boothia Peninsula were so 
much more — I’m crazy to be 
leaving, he thought.

He clung to tlie bounding sled, 
trying to blank out the 33rd 
night and his incredible first ex- 
perience with Mafthalik. 

'"y^he sled runner jammed in 
broken ice. The sled almost 
capsized as it abruptly stopped. 
His sunglasses slid down his 
nose. 

Blinking, Dr. West slid off 
the sled, hoisted the runner free 
and shouted at the dogs, who 
surged forward. Dr. West found 
himself loping behind the sled, 
trying to overtake it, running. He 
fell, dislodging his glasses as 
he lunged through the blinding 
white glare, almost seizing the 
sled, skidding across a puddle of 
melt-water. Springing up, run- 
ning hard and shouting angrily 
at the dogs, he had thought they 
would stop, but they were veer- 
ing off to the left, and their 
loose gait accelerated to an ex- 
cited rush as if they had scented 
a seal. 

His commanding shouts grew 
shrill. Desperately he ran a short- 
er course to head them off, but 
they were bounding too fast, the 
lightened sled skipping behind 
them. Without the sled he was 
helpless, hopeless. His eyesight 
whirled with blinding lights. He 
tripped. 

Kneeling upward, gasping with 
breathless panic, he unslung his 
rifle. In the glare, his twitching 



eye could barely distinguish the 
front sight as it shook back and 
forth. Aiming ahead of the dogs 
he fired. 

Unchecked, the dogs ran into 
the blinding distance. He fired 
and fired. A dog turned end for 
end, biting its rump as the other 
dogs dragged it along. A dog in 
front of the sled yelped and was 
mounted by the sled-runners as 
the team swept on. Dragging two 
writhing dogs and the swerving 
sled, the dog team charged on like 
troops into battle. 

The leader abruptly stopped 
as he reached an open lead and 
the sled skidded sideways braked 
only by the bodies of the two 
wounded dogs from sliding into 
the dark water and engulfing 
them all. 

'T^he dog team stood looking 
back at Dr. West, their 
breath fogging. If there had been 
a seal, it was long gone. 

Kabloona, you panicked. Dr. 
West blundered toward the 
team’s watching eyes and steam- 
ing grins. 

His unprotected eyes were 
shimmering and blurring but he 
had to recapture the sled before 
he could go back to search for 
his dark glasses. 

One dog lay limply entangled 
with the sled. The other whined 
and sniffed its shattered spine. 

The sled dogs watched, their 

117 



THE ESKIMO INVASION 



tongues lolling out of great grins, 
while he pointed the rifle muzzle 
at the wounded dog’s ear, closed 
his eyes and pulled the trigger. 

His hand trembling. Dr. West 
cut through the leather traces 
and freed both dogs. Squinting 
against the whiteness, he tried to 
see back along the sled runners’ 
trail all the way to the indistinct 
pressure ridge where he thought 
he had fallen, where he had lost 
his glasses. 

He was afraid Edwardluk and 
the other two would have heard 
the shots, but they should be a 
long way off near the iceberg. 
Surely that was a different ice- 
berg. His eyes were killing him! 

To reduce the glare, he slit his 
handkerchief and tied it across 
his eyes. Almost blinded, he 
shouted at the dogs, pushed the 
sled, yelled, cursed, flailed with 
the whip while dogs dodged in 
every direction, and suddenly the 
dog team darted, curved and 
flowed along their back-trail to- 
ward the pressure ridge. He in- 
tended to allow himself one min- 
ute to search for his sunglasses. 

“Kabloona, here are your snow 
eyes!” Edwardluk stood, holding 
the dark glasses above his head. 

Dr. West tore off the handker- 
chief, but did not see the other 
two men in ambush. 

“Hand me the glasses.” Dr. 
West did not point the rifle di- 
rectly at Edwardluk. 



TT dwardluk’s small hand ex- 
tended the sunglasses. “Bad 
dogs run away,” his voice mur- 
mured, and he ducked his head 
as if ashamed. He shuffled his 
mukluks on the ice. “This poor 
person couldn’t run fast enough 
permit this poor person to — ” 

“I cannot return to camp,” Dr. 
West interrupted. “I must go find 
the other whitemen now.” 

“The other whitemen,” Ed- 
wardluk agreed like an echo, and 
his real thinking emerged circui- 
tously. “Bad ice. Two dogs no 
more. We like you. We help you 
always. When ice is safe, we go. 
Tomorrow. Each day you will 
like us better.” 

Dr. West became aware of 
movement behind him, talked 
fast. “I cannot go back. I’ll help 
you. I’ll tell the whitemen your 
babies are hungry. I’ll send food. 
Because I like you,” he insisted, 
rapidly. “I like you. Great bear 
eat me if I lie.” 

Edwardluk looked up, and his 
shy smile widened. “Eh-eh. you 
want to go, we go! Someday we 
People help the whitemen. When 
we are many, help much. Help 
whitem.en of whole world.” Like 
a tiny giant, Edwardluk spread 
his arms and laughed, unaware 
that the world is 24,000 miles in 
circumference at the Equator, 
that there are six billion white- 
whitemen, yellow-whitemen and 
black-whitemen, that their vast 



118 



GALAXY 



machines rumble and lurch to- 
ward the stars. 

“Ha!” Edwardluk shouted at 
the dogs and cracked the whip. 
The sled rushed off carrying Dr. 
West, and Edwardluk, running 
alongside, shouted: “There is the 
mountain.” 

“Which direction is the Post?” 
Dr. West meant the Cultural 
Sanctuary Guard Post, whose 
radar the bush pilot had tried to 
avoid. 

“Eh-eh, my brother has been 
there, and this person’s eyes 
turned inward see. On a line 
past the mountain past the island 
three — four sleeps. The white- 
men will see this person helping 
you.” 

IV 

''T^he dogs soon tired, and Dr. 

West trotted beside the sled 
toward the gleaming horizon. 

Slipping, tiring, he jammed the 
muzzle of his rifle into the ice as 
he fell and rose muttering, stag- 
gering after the relentlessly glid- 
ding sled. He was encased in 
perspiration as he slogged into 
the blinding sun. 

The idea came to him in his 
exhaustion. If Edwardluk’s plan 
was to wear him out and then 
seize the rifle — 

When the sled snagged on a 
pressure ridge. Dr. West lay 
on the sled. The dogs lay down. 



“Eh-eh!” Edwardluk scamp- 
ered about with seemingly inex- 
haustible energy trying to sight 
a seal, forcing two of the harpoon 
shafts into the ice, erecting a tat- 
tered caribou skin windbreak. 
“Eh-eh, you rest in camp. This 
person talk to seal, eh-eh.” He 
hefted the last harpoon. He 
walked into the distance. 

The wind hissed over the ice, 
bending the caribou skins into a 
funnel, a wind-funnel directed at 
Dr. West’s congealing body. Ed- 
wardluk had vanished. Shivering, 
Dr. West ceased to know he was 
shivering until his ears awoke 
him to the distant grunting of 
the polar bear. 

“Eh-eh,” Edwardluk’s voice 
laughed. “He don’t find no seals 
either.” 

The dogs’ voices whined, but 
their tone was not hunger. Dr. 
West’s e5relids seemed glued to- 
gether. The dog’s voices whined 
with fear. Alaskan Eskimo dogs 
would have been roaring with 
eagerness to rush along the scent 
of the polar bear, he thought. 
These dogs were whining. 

Dr. West slid his fingers under 
his sunglasses to his throbbing 
eyelids. Overpowering light pene- 
trated although his eyes were 
closed. His head ached with pain 
messages from his overloaded op- 
tic nerves. When he tried to open 
his eyes, he gasped, drowned in 
dazzling liquid light. 



fHE ESKIMO INVASION

He was snowblind. 

''T^he distant bear emitted a 
hoarse cough. Dr. West’s 
hand tightened on his rifle. 
When a bear is hungry enough, 
he thought, it will stalk sled dogs 
lying on the ice like seals. When 
a bear is starving it sees nothing 
but seals, and I am blind. 

“Eh-eh,” Ekiwardluk’s voice 
laughed, “nothing but seals. Give 
me the rifle. Big noise will tell 
bear we are not seals.” 

“I win hold the rifle,” Dr. West 
replied; he was afraid the rifle 
was all he had, snowblind and 
helpless. “I know how to work 
it.” 

“This person knows how to 
work it,” Edwardluk volunteered, 
and Dr. West could hear him 
moving closer. “My brother had 
one and he shot it all the time.” 

But not at bears. Dr. West 
thought. 

“At bears,” Edwardluk’s voice 
persisted. “My brother shot a 
bear and that is why he van- 
ished. It was bad for him to kill 
a bear.” Prior to this Edward- 
luk’s story had been that his 
brother had vanished while trav- 
elling to get more presents from 
the whitemen of the big whale- 
kayak, the whitemen with beauti- 
ful red stars on their caps. 

“You would not shoot the bear 
even if I gave you the rifle,” Dr. 
West riiplied, clinging to the rifle. 



“Eh-eh,” agreed Eldwardluk, 
this person is not a bear-killer 
like my brother. This person 
would only shoot a loud noise so 
the bear hears we are not seals.” 
He shuffled away. 

Dr. West clicked off the safety- 
catch. The recoilless rifle 
boomed, kicking viciously. There 
had been ice in the barrel, but 
it had not burst. “I have fright- 
ened the bear.” Now there was 
no need for Edwardluk to have 
the rifle. 

“If this person had the rifle, a 
seal could be shot.” Edwardluk’s 
voice moved closer. 

“There are three harpoons”. 
Dr. West replied. 

“But your eyes are bad,” Ed- 
wardluk began circuitously. 

“I will not give you the rifle.” 

Further away the polar bear 
made a strange mooing noise. 

“This person watched you 
while you sleep,” Edwardluk 
said, as if this was more impor- 
tant than the circling bear. “Eh- 
eh, asleep you frown, you twist. 
In the emcampment it was this 
way also. You look unhappy 
when asleep. My brother was 
that way. Even with arms around 
woman, your sleep-face is un- 
happy. Are all whitemen unhap- 
py when they sleep?” 

“How the hell should I know?” 
Dr. West slung his rifle over his 
back and crawled blindly on to 
the sled. “Let’s go!” 



120 



GALAXY 



“Whitemen do not shoot the 
People?” Edwardluk asked. “As 
if we are dogs?” 

“No, I was frightened when I 
shot the dogs. I thought they 
were running away. I thought 
they were leaving me alone to 
die. I only shoot things that are 
leaving me to die.” 

J oe West clung on the dragging 
sled, his head muffled in a 
darkness of caribou skin, his eyes 
throbbing and flashing lights of 
pain. Once he heard Edwardluk 
shouting to someone, and his 
stomach contracted. He dreamed 
Edwardluk had circled back to 
the encampment. No escape. 
Then he realized Edwardluk had 
merely admonished the dogs. 

The sled was moving sporadi- 
cally as if the dogs were exhaust- 
ed. 

Motionless, Dr. West was 
awakened by the distant crack- 
whoosh of a recoilless rifle. 
Whitemen? Dr. West’s fingers 
clawed along the oddly thin 
stock of his -rifle. He was holding 
on to a harpoon shaft. “My rifle. 
He’s stolen my rifle.” 

The dogs whined, hungrily 
straining, but the sled creaked 
immovably because Edwardluk 
had anchored it to the ice so 
that the dogs could not rush for- 
ward at the sound of the shot, 
which meant seal-meat. 

Edwardluk’s plodding return 



and a dragging sound were over- 
whelmed by the roaring lunges of 
the dogs. Edwardluk was feeding 
the dogs first, hurling thuds of 
meat within their harnessed 
range. Then he was beating them 
off. “No more! Got no more!” 

“Here is the warm liver.” Ed- 
wardluk must have carried it un- 
der his parka. “Eat. This person 
left a little blubber by the water 
for the bear. Eat. The great bear 
will see how we helped the bear. 
Eat. Soon this person shoots a 
bigger seal. You eat. Where we 
are, many wide cracks and soon 
another seal. Then this person 
will eat.” 

From the distance rose a long- 
drawn howling roar like a giant, 
insane. 

“My God! Was that the bear?” 

“This person don’t know. The 
bear, it was the bear. A little 
taste of blubber wake up bear’s 
stomach. Eh, eh,” Edwardluk 
laughed nervously. “Bear want to 
eat world.” 

“Give me my rifle,” Dr. West 
demanded angrily. 

“Eh-eh, he is only a bear.” Ed- 
wardluk clicked the rifle’s safety 
on or off; there was no way for 
Dr. West’s ears to tell which. 
Edwardluk’s voice diminished as 
he moved away. “Bear don’t like 
man’s smell. Once my brother’s 
rifle don’t work, and he lie still 
and bear sniff him and go away.” 

The snarling was the dogs. 



THE ESKIMO INVASION

are you doing?” Dr. 

West meant: don’t leave 
me alone. 

“ — to shoot another seal. Dogs 
not fed enough to sleep, only 
enough to fight each other. This 
person must look for another 
seal.” Edwardluk added with 
practicality: “Your smell will 
keep the bear away from dogs. 
Before very long this person 
come back.” 

Dr. West groped on the sled 
for the harpoon shaft, clutching 
it. 

“Best thing is sleep,” Edward- 
luk’s voice said, softer, but closer. 
Instead of leaving, Edwardluk 
squatted down so close Dr. West 
could feel his radiated warmth 
next to him and could hear his 
excited breathing. 

“The important thing, will the 
whitemen like us?” Edwardluk 
blurted. “We don’t harm any- 
body. We helped you. We want 
to help everybody because — we 
know. You frown, you twist when 
you sleep. But we sleep happy 
all with same dream because we 
are here, we are there, we know 
why.” 

Edwardluk’s voice hoarsened 
with emotion, with joy, and his 
hand gently closed on Dr. West’s 
wrist. The great bear will come 
down when there are enough of 
us and — ” 

Dr. West had stiffened invol- 
untarily, and Edwardluk stop- 



ped, as if sensing rejection. 
Again, Dr. West knew what Ed- 
wardluk was thinking: you don’t 
like us. For 33 days Dr. West had 
been bombarded by the love and 
mythology of these people. They 
wanted — needed — to be liked. 

If these people were not caged 
in this Cultural Sanctuary, Dr. 
West wondered, would they be 
scurrying door to door, knocking 
and disturbing housewives with 
their joyful apocalyptic mes- 
sage? 

“He will come,” Edwardluk’s 
voice insisted, “when we have 
covered the world for him!” Ed- 
wardluk’s grip tightened on Dr. 
West’s wrist. “Our bodies will re- 
ward him for our birth.” Edward- 
luk’s voice rose in confidence and 
joy. “His great hunger is for us, 
for us. To this world and all 
worlds, he comes.” 

Edwardluk released his grip, 
standing up. His foot-steps shuf- 
fled away over the ice. The dogs 
whined with hunger and hope of 
seal meat. 

Through the wind drifted the 
distant grunting of the bear, and 
the wind hissed across the sled. 
Under the icy caribou skins. Dr. 
West lay shivering. Eskimos say 
real life, dream life, begins while 
sleeping cold, dreaming cold, 
awakened into sleep like a wolf 
inhaling the scents, like a cari- 
bou hearing the most distant 
sounds, like a hand feeling ....

Touring the 3rd night he had 
camped with these people in 
an overcrowded tent where their 
stench congealed in leaden cold; 
his only desire had been for sleep. 
He pushed away the smoothly 
bare arm. Tired and still appre- 
hensive of venereal disease and 
lice, he did not want any anony- 
mous and greasy Eskimo girl. 
“Eh-eh,” her faceless voice gig- 
gled. “Marthalik.” 

“Go away. I want sleep.” But 
with warming excitement he dis- 
covered he was becoming — he 
had become a lover of an inten- 
sity he had never experienced. 
His mounting ego said: Super- 
man, you’re getting out of it 
what you put into it. But he 
overpraised himself. Smooth- 
bellied and moving indescribab- 
ly, Marthalik was the lover, he 
discovered. Marthalik. 

In Marthalik’s arms he 
dreamed the bear was approach- 
ing. 

He laughed in his sleep. 
Unique. Marthalik might have 
become his Cleopatra, his God- 
dess Calypso who imprisoned 
Ulysses in her island bed. He 
might have become an odd wan- 
derer with an Eskimo wife. But 
when he went out to help search 
for Edwardluk’s “brother”, Mar- 
thalik had not accompanied him. 
She was not feeling well. Think- 



ing of her warmth, he had trud- 
ged away with a dozen Eskimos. 

Camped in the lee of a cliff, 
Edwardluk had persisted in of- 
fering his sister or his wife; Dr. 
West was too sleepy to recognize 
which. Worn by Edwardluk’s 
generosity, anxious not to hurt 
anyone’s feelings. Dr. West said: 
“Oh, hell,” and embraced her. 
Wonderful surprise! She was as 
wonderful as Marthalik. They all 
were. This went on and on. These 
wonderful women could conquer 
the world. He laughed in his 
sleep. 

Even on the 23rd day, when he 
noticed that Marthalik, his first 
slender girl of the 3rd night, now 
appeared slightly thick-waisted 
and heavy-gaited, he could not 
forsee the reason the age-pop- 
ulation curve in this encampment 
was skewed so drastically to chil- 
dren and babies. 

During the 33rd night a girl 
gave birth to a son. Dr. West 
tried to believe he confused one 
girl with another. They all looked 
so much alike. This girl could 
not be Marthalik. Holding her 
mewing baby under her chin 
smiling proudly, she reassured 
him. “Eh, this person is Martha- 
lik.” 

Her baby appeared to be typ- 
ical Eskimo baby fathered by an 
Eskimo. There was a typical 
mongoloid blue spot near the 
base of the spine. Even Eskimo 



THE ESKIMO INVASION 



123 




babies are born with blue eyes. 
He kept telling himself he could 
not be the father. Marthalik 
could not be the mother. This 
was a full term baby, which 
should take approximately nine 
months. A thirty-day gestation 
period should be impossible for 
a human being. It would be cat- 
astrophic for humans enmasse. 

These people cannot be Es- 
kimos. What are they? 



Ohivering into wakefulness, 
^ awakened by whining dogs. 
Dr. West sat up on the anchored 
sled. The grunting sound, like an 
approaching hog, was the polar 
bear. 

With his finger and thumb. 



124 



GALAXY 



Dr. West peeled one eyelid open 
and gasped with pain, stabbed 
by the blinding white light. His 
eyes flooded with tears. Along 
the sled he groped for the two 
harpoons. 

“Edwardluk!” he shouted, and 
the vast emptiness of sea-ice 
swallowed his voice and returned 
like a false echo the grunting of 
the bear. 

His hand gripped the harpoon 
shaft. Best weapon for a blind- 
man? To his own surprise he 
laughed. A bit shrilly, but he 
laughed. Turning his head to 
follow the pig-like noises of the 
bear, he extended the harpoon. 
“Come on you invisible spook! 
I’m a man, not a seal.” 




His pounding heart, his surg- 
ing andrenilin, had given him 
back his warmth, his liveness. He 
laughed with surprise that he 
was not afraid. 

Much closer than before, the 
bear growled. 

The dogs yelped, violently 
thrashing the anchored sled, con- 
cealing any sounds of the bear. 

In this uncertain moment Dr. 
West re-evaluated. These doge 
were straining to escape. Escape 
was simple! 

His atavistic flow of courage 
froze. With the hurried gasps of 
a civilized man. Dr. West drop- 
ped the harpoon and unsheathed 
his short-bladed skinning knife. 

Of course the dogs would run, 
he thought. They would drag the 
sled away, carrying him. 

The bear growled. 

Tight-muscled with fright. Dr. 
West lurched across the straining 
sled, fumbled back along the rail 
until his hand found the taut 
anchor strap. His knife slashed. 

''T^he strap broke, the lunging 
dogs yanking the sled from 
under him. He fell on his elbow 
on the ice, momentarily stunned 
by his stupidity as the clamor of 
the fleeing dog team faded into 
the distance. 

He couldn’t escape, ’ne 
thought. Was he predestined 
to — ? 

“Edwardluk!” Dr. West started 

125 



THE ESKIMO INVASION 



to rise, and was warned by a 
cavernous growl. 

He remained in a crouching 
posture, turning his head in the 
direction from which the sound 
had emerged. He was facing up- 
wind, and an odor of rotten meat 
became noticeable, but now he 
couldn’t hear the bear. The bear 
must be motionless, staring at 
him. 

Gradually, Dr. West sank 
down on the ice, his knife hand 
under his shoulder as he flat- 
tened out on the ice, his vulner- 
able stomach pressed against the 
ice, his legs pressed together, his 
shoulders hunched protectively 
about his neck. His chest pressed 
against the ice, his heart thud- 
ding against the ice. He could 
hear the hiss-hiss of its breathing, 
the bear’s shuffling advance. 

Dr. West made no new at- 
tempts to open his eyes. He tried 
to see backward into his con- 
crete-block cottage in California. 
It became a sunlit fortress. Be- 
hind the locked door, behind the 
multi-colored dusty books on the 
top shelf lay his .44 magnum 
Ruger Blackhawk revolver, 
heavy hog-leg single-action re- 
volver, gleaming thick cylinder 
stuffed with six bullets looking 
fat as thumbs, packed with ex- 
p! osive — emptiness. 

The bear snorted. Motionless 
on the ice, Dr. West suppressed 
his breathing. He remembered 



Alaskan Eskimo hunters laugh- 
ing how they had behaved in 
such situations. Prostrate before 
their bears, they had lived to 
joke. “Don’t breathe,” Eskimos 
say. “Bear never kills dead man.” 

The polar bear’s stench en- 
gulfed him. Above him poised 
the hiss-hiss of its breathing. 
There was a gurgling sound, the 
ravenous contractions of its di- 
gestive system. 

As forcibly as the blunt end 
of a baseball bat, the polar bear 
nosed his thigh, trying to turn 
him over. 

Desperately, he wanted to 
lunge away but lay in fear the 
bear’s quick paw would smash 
him like a seal if he moved. 

He wanted to leap away with 
a nightmare shriek as the bear’s 
nose clubbed his thigh, his hip, 
shoving to turn him over, to ex- 
pose his vital belly. Resisting, 
Dr. West tried to sag against the 
ice, to keep his belly down. 

With an eager grunt and a ser- 
ies of hisses, the bear’s nose bur- 
rowed under him, pushing up his 
hip. He twisted, was clamped — ^ 

The shriek apd muscular 
spasm ballooned to his conscious- 
ness. His thigh, the bear’s jaws! 
With the squawling vitality of 
any animal being devoured alive, 
the former Dr. West writhed, 
striking the- knife blade across 
the hard muzzle of the polar 
bear. 



126 



GALAXY 



With a startled woof, the 
bear’s jaws opened. Dr. 
West’s body rolled away slash- 
ing the air and screaming de- 
fiance like a cornered animal. 
Backing away, gasping, he 
hacked the air with the knife 
while the shuffling sounds of the 
bear departed. 

He became aware of the throb- 
bing of his thigh. Gummed eye- 
lids torn open, he faced blindly 
into the whiteness and listened 
through his own harsh breathing 
for the silent bear, and remem- 
bered who he was. 

Dr. West’s fingers explored the 
slippery twitching remnants of 
his thigh muscle. Hard-jawed, he 
toumiqueted his belt around his 
thigh and gasped. 

“Edwardluk,” he gurgled. “Ed- 
wardluk, Edwardluk!” he yelled. 

There was no Edwardluk. 
“Edwardluk! Edwardluk!” 

His voice thickened. His head 
seemed to sail away, and he mut- 
tered and twisted, resisting. If he 
fell into shock, he thought, in 
this cold he would be dead. 

Dead, dead, irretrievably dead. 
All gone. Finished. Nothing. 

From hissing wind emerged a 
scraping sound approaching. Ed- 
wardluk’s voice wheezed, “Dogs 
turn away from water too late. 
Sled float. Curlytail drown. 
Loafer drown.” All Edwardluk 
could talk about was the dogs. 
“Hump drown. Wind Runner 



drown.” Edwardluk slid darkness 
and warmth down over Dr. 
West’s head and shoulders; Ed- 
wardluk was giving him his outer 
parka. “White Eye drown.” 

Edwardluk was prodding his 
leg, wrapping his leg in some- 
thing jelly-like within wet fur. 
“Fished out dogs. Cut up. Eh- 
eh,” Edwardluk laughed feebly, 
“much good dog meat for ev- 
eryone. This person cut open 
Wind Runner and White Eye for 
bear.” 

With crunching sounds, Ed- 
wardluk was breaking apart the 
sled, rebuilding it into a tiny 
man-sled. Gently, Edwardluk’s 
hands tied Dr. West on the sled. 

T)lind, Dr. West knew they 
were microscopic specks in 
the enormity of sea-ice, shore-ice 
and ice-shaped mountain-islands. 

“We go!” With a grunt, Ed- 
wardluk strained at the harness, 
and the jolting hours moved 
through chills and sleep and 
fever, becoming days of blind 
agony without end. 

Edwardluk’s soft voice tried to 
soothe. “Eat-eat.” He was press- 
ing chewed dog meat into Dr. 
West’s mouth. 

Edwardluk would shout: “Ha! 
Forward, dogs!” and Edward- 
luk’s stubby legs would tramp 
forward, endlessly dragging the 
man-sled with its raving burden. 
Dr. West. 



THE ESKIMO INVASION 



127 



“The bear,” Dr. West would 
gasp. “Got to warn them.” The 
Canadian Cultural Sanctuary 
Commission became twelve pairs 
of eyes surrealistically floating in 
a jury box. “Please believe me.” 
The population pressure among 
nations, in the amoeba-like grow- 
ing struggles of the population 
masses of the world, these mul- 
tiplying Eskimos will be the 
Bomb for whatever nation makes 
use of these. “Believe me, they’re 
not Eskimos.” 

In his delirium, Marthalik’s 
face rose smiling. He clung to 
her body. The droning of the air- 
plane transformed snowflakes in- 
to parachutes drifting down with 
swaying food packages. As ab- 
surdly as Pop Art, these were 
paint-labeled FAMILY AL- 
LOWANCES, swaying back and 
forth. Massive jaws crunching. 

“Too many Eskimos.” For 
these happy people what did the 
bear symbolize? “Don’t feed the 
bear!” he shrieked. 

The giggling Eskimo women 
were stuffing ovulation suppres- 
sant pills into their ears. Their 
bellies inflated. The Earth tipped. 
From the darkness of space 
opened the jaws. “The bear!” he 
shrieked. 

In more lucid moments. Dr. 
West clutched his swollen thigh 
and thought what a good man 
Edwardluk was. Laughing, strain- 
ing, uncomplaining, that was the 



Eskimo image. They were cheer- 
ful people who fought no wars. 
It was true. So true. Men of 
goodwill all over the world would 
not let the Eskimos starve no 
matter how many Eskimos . 

VI 

'"T^he headwind carried the 
smell of fuel oil smoke, the 
barking of dogs. 

“Carry the poor bloke into the 
storehouse where it’s dark. I’ll 
take the rag off ’is blinkers. Coo! 
Eyes like bloody sores!” The 
man’s voice was the perpetual 
employee. Dr. West thought daz- 
edly, another Englishman im- 
ported to Canada in the popula- 
tion struggle. 

The French-speaking Cana- 
dians were outbreeding the rest 
two to one, gaining numerical 
control in spite of English immi- 
gration. French Separatists no 
longer spoke of separations but 
of P'rench as the required lang- 
uage in all of Canada’s schools. 
Dr. West’s eyes throbbed like 
hammer blows into his skull. His 
snowblind eyes — 

“Kerosene eye drops I always 
says,” the ex-Londoner’s voice 
was croaking. “ ’Ere comes the 
Commissioner. Kerosene eye 
drops for snowblindness.” 

“No, wait!” Dr. West gasped. 
“Leave my eyes alone. I’m a 
doctor. I need special treatment. 



128 



GALAXY 



I must be flown to a hospital 
with — with Eldwardluk.” 

“If you’re a doctor, where’s 
your kit?” the Cultural Sanc- 
tuary Commissioner’s voice ac- 
cused. “You’re another cultural 
smuggler. You smuggling bas- 
tards won’t leave the world’s 
best people alone, not for a min- 
ute! You’re the third smuggler 
I’ve caught in my district this 
year.” 

“No steel fishhooks, no trans- 
istor batteries on ’im,” the ex- 
Londoner protested. “Coo! Com- 
missioner, look at ’is leg!” 

The Commissioner evidently 
bent over Dr. West’s leg because 
there was a retching sound. 
“Gangrene.” 

“Dog bite him,” Edwardluk’s 
voice volunteered. “Bad leg. This 
person drag him on little sled — 
that many sleeps.” Edwardluk 
must be holding up stubby fin- 
gers, feigning ignorance of count- 
ing. “Dogs drown. This person 
drag him all way from Mountain 
Bay.” 

“Thom Bay? That’s an ex- 
tremely difficult and hazardous 
— my man, you’ve completed an 
epic journey!” The Commission- 
er panted with pleasure. “You’re 
a hero.” 

T Te must be shaking Edward- 
-*■ luk’.s hand, and Edwardluk 
giggled with embarrassment. 
“Pulled wliitemen long way. 



People hungry. He say much 
food here.” 

“No one will starve,” the Com- 
missioner said warmly. “Emer- 
gency Family Allowances will be 
authorized. Survival always is 
more important than 100% self- 
sufficiency. If necessary we’ll 
even paradrop a Family Allow- 
ance for every Family Head on 
the Boothia District Roster!” 

“Eh-eh??” Edwardluk’s voice 
laughed in confusion. “Will you 
help us? Many-many people 
hungry!” Edwardluk must be 
spreading his stubby arms. 
“Many people. Here his marker- 
book.” 

“I’ll be damned!” From -the 
sounds, the Commissioner must 
be thumbing through Dr. West’s 
notebook. 

“He count people. Say not 
enough seals.” Edwardluk ex- 
pounded. “He count babies. Say 
more hungry quick.” 

“We’ll make our own popula- 
tion survey. This man evidently 
is deranged. He appears to be dy- 
ing.” 

“We help Whiteman. He say all 
wliitemen will like us because we 
help him.” Earnestly, Edwardluk 
must be pressing his hand on his 
chest. “This poor person carry 
whiteman all this way. Pull sled 
like dog,” Edwardluk laughed 
nervously. 

“You’re a better man than the 
whitemen!” The Commissioner 



THE ESKIMO INVASION

was bubbling with enthusiasm for 
his Elskimos. “You’ve made an 
epic journey; there will be food 
for everyone. Boothia District 
will gain proper notice if you will 
speak thus on the C.B.C. The 
telly, the picture box. “Tell them 
of the hunger.” 

“People hungry,” Edwardluk 
repeated wistfully enough to 
melt the hearts of any T.V. 
audience. “Babies hungry.” 

Dr. West gritted his teeth. 
There was no use attempting to 
speak now. The Commissioner 
would not listen because he was 
in no mood for an “attack” 
against the Eskimos. Later — 

This Commissioner emotional- 
ly would reject unpleasant facts. 
Finally when the Canadian Cul- 
tural Sanctuary Commissioners’ 
noses were rubbed in the evi- 
dence, in the sinister implications 
of a one-month gestation period, 
both the Commission and the 
Canadian Government would 
temporize. Dr. West thought. 

“Forcible birth control? 

Surely not in a free nation! 
No matter what you say, they’re 
as human as I am,” this Com- 
missioner would protest. “What 
would you wish us to do, let these 
good, happy, cooperative people 
starve? The real moral issue be- 
comes GENOCIDE!” Dr. West’s 
thoughts had a dream-hke real- 
ity. 



“Coo! Is he d3ung?” said a 
voice which penetrated Dr. 
West’s delirium. 

\ nd Eskimos have Asian iden- 
tifications. Dr. West dreamed 
the U. N. General Assemb- 
ly with outraged shouts and 
dark faces rising against a rumor 
that Canada was planning “Es- 
kimo family limitation.” “Ster- 
ilization!” “Imperialist suppres- 
sion!” To aid tlie starving and 
disadvantaged Eskimos, the Chi- 
nese Federation of Nations would 
offer Cultural Assistance. Roar- 
ing airplanes from Asia, from 
Europe, from embarrassed Amer- 
ica would parachute food 
throughout the spreading Arctic 
while the people multiplied and 
multiplied. 

“Eh-eh, we fill world,” Ed- 
wardluk had explained weeks ago 
with lovable simplicity, “until 
bear comes.” 

Death gnawed Dr. West’s leg, 
and he tried to sit up while Ed- 
wardluk’s gentle hands held him 
down. 

“Must speak,” Dr. West 
gasped, thinking: I must live. “I 
must speak.” 

“You sleep now,” Edwardluk 
was whispering, holding him 
down. “He come.” 

In his delirium. Dr. West could 
hear the galactic runting of the 
bear. —HAYDEN HOWARD

Automatic Twin-Tube Wishing Machine

Extract from . GOOD BUY,

AUTOMATIC TWIN-TUBE 
WISHING AAACHINES 

(Note: this forms part of our 
series of reports on products not 
yet in very general demand, but 
representing a substantial invest- 
ment of credit — cf. our recent 
tests of inexpensive time ma- 
chines.) 

Introduction 

We have received many letters 
asking what we think of twin- 
tube wishing machines. Typical 
is the following: 



"I’m overworked and under- 
paid. Sometimes it seems there 
are only two choices left to me 
— the third, suicide, wouldn’t 
help because I can’t keep up 
the pa 5 rments on suicide insur- 
ance. 

“Either I’ll have to have my- 
self twinned so I can moonlight 
a second job — and I don’t 
know what I could do that would 
cover the payments on the twin- 
ning — or else I’ll have to go 
ten per cent deeper into hock 
and buy a wishing machine. At 
Cr. 25,000 or so they aren’t 
cheap, but on the other hand the 
idea of making everything for 
ourselves seems wonderful. My 
wife says yes, get one, because 



131 



it would be living like our an- 
cestors used to, completely self- 
sufficient (we have strong pio- 
neer traditions here on New 
Frontier), but I said no, I guess 
there may be a catch, let’s wait 
till GOOD BUY covers them.” 

Not everyone, alas, has that 
much good sense. Over the past 
decade scores of news stories 
have testified to the fate of 
hasty purchasers who succumbed 
to wild advertising claims. 

Swamped by debt, Ebenezer J. 
Younghusband of Venable’s 
World boasted to his friends that 
he’d seen a way out of his diffi- 
cuties. He mortgaged his grand- 
children’s earning capacity to 
buy a wishing machine. He en- 
visaged making and selling ur- 
anium-235 on a rising market to 
recoup his expenditure. Three 
tiiousand casualties occurred, 
mostly fatal, when he allowed 10 
kg. to accumulate in the hopper. 

Likewise, rendered desperate 
the problem of supporting her 
eleven children, widowed Mrs. 
Honoria Quonsett of Hysteria 
sold six of her offspring to an 
illegal service agency and invest- 
ed in a wishing machine, think- 
ing she could redeem them when 
it had stabilized her affairs. The 
machine she was able to afford 
-was inadequately insulated 
against feedback from the user’s 
subconscious, and — since she was 
naturally concerned with her 



children’s fate above all ^ — be- 
gan to manufacture duplicates of 
them. The more frantic she grew, 
the more the machine churned 
out. As even the finest machine is 
unable to create a fully function- 
ing human, something like 95 
imbeciles are now a charge on 
the Hysterian government, and 
Mrs. Quonsett is permanently 
hospitalized. 

So, if you’re considering buy- 
ing a wishing machine, bear three 
points in mind: the advertisers’ 
claims are exaggerated; extreme 
care is always necessary in use; 
and — most important of all — 
these machines are machines, not 
magic wands! 

Background 

Immediately Charlie Volumin- 
ous MacDiomnaid, a century or 
so ago, turned “transmutation 
without radiation” from a vote- 
catching slogan into a practical 
reality. All technically advanced 
planets began to dream of short- 
circuiting the conventional man- 
ufacturing processes and creating 
articles at need from crude mat- 
ter and raw energy. 

In 2276 the first notable step 
towards this goal was accom- 
plished accidentally on Coca- 
hymnia, when Abdul Fidler gave 
up trying to describe the instru- 
ments he wanted to play his fa- 
mous “Catastrophe Suite” and 
had himself spliced directly into 



132 



GALAXY 



the computer-operated controls 
of a woodwind factory. Further 
development led to one of the 
two essential elements of a mod- 
ern manufacturing complex: the 
visualizer tube, which extracts 
from the mind of the person in 
charge the characteristics of the 
desired product. 

The necessity for a second con- 
trolling element emerged when 
Fidler discovered that human 
musicians couldn’t play the in- 
.struments he had devised. For 
his “Variations on the Theme 
of Planetary Collision” he at- 
tempted to surpass his earlier 
achievement and create a sup- 
erior musician, too. The lifeform 
resulting had an enormous brain, 
incredibly acute hearing, 28 pairs 
of hands and sufficient mouths 
to play 11 wind instruments at 
once. 

On seeing it, Fidler let out a 
cry of joy approximately a sixth 
of a tone below G flat in altis- 
simo, and the creature — so sen- 
sitive it could not endure this 
deviation from perfect pitch — 
manipulated him until he was 
.screaming exactly on the note. 
The loss of his talent was a se- 
vere blow to galactic music, but 
his death established the need 
for the moderator tube, charged 
with powers of judgement re- 
garding the feasibility and per- 
missibility of the product. Not 
unexpectedly, the immense range 

GALACTIC CONSUMER REPORTS 



of the human imagination meant 
that the early installations had 
to be huge. The pilot version 
covered about a hectare of 
ground. 

However, though such size 
confined the process to commer- 
cial undertakings, partial suc- 
cess was better than none and 
soon factories working on these 
principles were a common sight 
on prosperous planets. 

The ultimate target — provid- 
ing private consumers with home 
appliances that they need only 
switch on and think into — ap- 
peared as remote as ever until 
the genius of Gordian Bludgeon, 
a factory-hand on Odin, broke 
the deadlock. 

One day, during a five-minute 
period of random thinking in- 
tended to clear his mind for a 
changeover from family space- 
boats to sanitary appliances, he 
snapped his fingers and started 
to concentrate on the idea of an 
automatic twin-tube wishing ma- 
chine no larger than a robochef. 

It is pointless to deny that like 
so many geniuses Bludgeon en- 
joyed imperfect mental stability. 
However, it is indisputable that 
without his brilliant inspiration 
wishing machines for home use 
would not yet be available. 
Though refinements have sub- 
sequently been incorporated, 
every machine we saw was a mo- 
dification of his original version. 

133 



Chief among the refinements, 
incidentally, is the elimination 
of a circuit he included because 
his former girl-friend had just 
married the factory manager. It 
is now illegal to describe in print 
what this was intended to do, but 
by reading between the lines of 
the distorted account in Harold 
Knockermaker’s Bludgeon the 
Man any averagely aggressive 
male should be able to figure it 
out. 

Brands tested 

We found a total of seven wish- 
ing machines that fitted the sti'ict 
definition of “twin-tube” (i.e. 
having both a visualizer and a 
moderator) and “automatic” 
(i.e. not requiring the prelimin- 
ary insertion of ready-made 
parts). All of them cost in the 
region of Cr. 25,000. 

Cheaper models are on offer, 
but they lack the moderator 
tube. They should not be bought 
under any circumstances. The 
fact that Eblis is currently quar- 
antined from the rest of the gal- 
axy and languishing under the 
most savage dictatorship in his- 
tory is directly attributable to 
the purchase by a Mrs. Phobia 
Luncheon of such a machine. Her 
five-year-old son Elgin, in a tant- 
rum over the refusal of an ice 
cream soda, started the machine 
and set it to making nuclear- 
armed robot soldiers two meters 



tall, with whose aid he overran 
the planet and set up a drugstore 
with a soda fountain a kilometer 
long. (He is expected to die of 
malnutrition in about 2335, but 
it is impossible to estimate how 
many of Eblis’s population will 
survive him.) 

These are the models we test- 
ed, and the chief slogans used 
to advertise them: 

CORNUCOPIA: “A Horn of 
Plenty in the Home.” 

MIDAS : “Better than the 

Golden Touch.” 

CROESUS: “Everything mon- 
ey can or can’t buy.” 
INEXHAUSTIBLE: “Every- 
one is on the make!” 

ZILLIONAIRE: “Beyond the 
dreams of avarice.” 

WIZARD: “Magical manufac- 
turing.” 

DOMESTICATED DJINN; 
“There is no God but Allah; 
however, the profit is entirely 
yours.” 

The MIDAS and CROESUS, 
on inspection, proved to be iden- 
tical except for the nameplate af- 
fixed to the front of the cabinet. 
The former costs Cr. 200 more 
than the latter. The makers re- 
fused to comment on this. 

Appearance and finish 

With the following qualifica- 
tions the finish of the products 
was rated “acceptable” by our 
test panel. 



134 



GALAXY 



The CORNUCOPIA was near- 
ly twice as big as the largest of 
the others, and the makers rec- 
ommend that the first use it 
be put to after purchase is the 
construction of an extra room 
to hold it. 

The output hopper supplied 
with the MIDAS and CROESUS 
imposed an arbitrary limit on 
the size of articles manufactured. 
Anything larger than approx. 2 
X 3 meters came out concerti- 
naed. In the end we sent for one 
of the range of non-standard 
oversize hoppers available at ex- 
tra charge. (We tried making 
our own with the machine, but 
the tolerances were of the order 
of two micrometers and the con- 
trols were insufficiently precise.) 

The DOMESTICATED 
DJINN was inscribed all over 
with excerpts from the Koran, 
and was time-switched to pre- 
vent its use when the owner 
was supposed to facing Mecca 
for prayer. Five periods of non- 
availability per day, each last- 
ing fifteen minutes, may consti- 
tute a drawback in the view of 
non-Moslems. 

The ZILLIONAIRE was 
smaller than the others in every 
respect including its visualizer 
cap, which fitted only one of 
our test panel (an eight-year- 
old boy chosen for the vividness 
of his imagination). We had to 
substitute the cap from the bas- 



ically similar WIZARD. The 
user’s chair was rated “very un- 
comfortable” by the entire panel, 
and we had to pack it with foam 
padding before anyone could sit 
through a production cycle. 

The INEXHAUSTIBLE pos- 
ed us several problems. Our at- 
tention had already been caught 
by the curious advertising copy 
announcing it. Sample: “MOST 
SPLENDIFEROUS THE NOT 
COSTLY WISHING MA- 
CHINE. YOU WANT, IT 
MAKE, NO MATTER WHAT- 
EVER THE DESIRE WITHIN 
REASONS OF COURSE!” 

The attractive gray cabinet 
was finished in a manner we had 
not previously encountered. 
When touched, it humped and 
rubbed against the hand, at the 
same time secreting a gummy 
fluid with a strong smell resem- 
bling banana-oil. The output (no 
hopper was fitted) was on top 
of the casing and could only be 
reached by a stepladder. The 
controls were on two boards at 
opposite ends of the housing, 
which meant that unless the 
user’s reach exceeded 3.2 m. and 
he had had the foresight to in- 
stall wall-mirrors to reflect the 
dials he had to walk back and 
forth all the time. This was 
rendered difficult by the hard 
flat bench, tilted at 35°, fitted 
in place of a user’s chair. Also 
there was no visualizer cap; 21 



GALACTIC CONSUMER REPORTS

separate leads had to be attached 
to the head with suction- cups, 
and the handbook advised shav- 
ing before use. 

Instruction ixtanuals, etc. 

Handbooks were supplied with 
five of the machines. That for the 
CORNUCOPIA promised: “No 
adjustment will be required for 
at least one Earth Standard 
Year.” But see below, Perform- 
ance. The cheaper CROESUS 
had a handbook, the MIDAS 
did not, which seemed odd. We 
used the same for both. That 
for the DOMESTICATED 
DJINN opened with an invo- 
cation: “In the name of Allah, 
the Merciful, let no harm be- 
fall users of this machine!” 
Again, see below. 

The ZILLIONAIRE had no 
instructions except a swing-tic- 
ket attached to the on-off 
switch, which read: “Any fault 
that develops in this machine 
can easily be rectified by hav- 
ing it produce a replacement 
part.” We should like to repeat 
the comment of our eight-year- 
old, but this publication has to 
go through the galactic mails. 

The instructions for the WIZ- 
ARD were in 174 languages, an 
admirable idea. Unfortunately 
the text in 173 of them (the 
exception being High Canal 
Martian) referred to a model dis- 
continued four years ago. 

136 



The manual for the INEX- 
HAUSTIBLE had apparently 
been produced on the machine 
by an inexperienced operator. 
It was a handsome volume of 
about 100 pages, of which all 
but the first 16 were blank. 

Guarantees 

The guarantee for the COR- 
NUCOPIA was acceptable, sub- 
ject to the deletion (don’t for- 
get to thumbprint it in the mar- 
gin) of the clause which runs: 
“The manufacturers will not be 
held liable for (a) the products 
of a diseased imagination; (b) 
operation of the machine by a 
minor; (c) death, disablement 
or disfigurement of any user by 
his/her productions.” 

None of the other guarantees 
was worth the permafilm they 
were printed in. The DOMES- 
TICATED D JINN’S stated, in- 
ter alia, “Omission of five-times- 
daily prayer voids this warran- 
ty.” The ZILLIONAIRE’s said: 
“We reserve the right to cancel 
this or any other ostensible war- 
ranty at out entire discretion.” 
The INEXHAUSTIBLE’S had 
at least the virtue of honesty (we 
think); it ran simply: “We de- 
cline responsibilities, all shapes, 
all sizes, all colors.” 

Power source and mode of 
operation 

As stated above, all wishing 

GALAXY 



machines on sale are similar to 
Bludgeon’s original concept. The 
user sits in a chair (INEX- 
HAUSTIBLE: scrambles back 
and forth over a sloping bench), 
puts on a cap connected to the 
visualizcr (INEXHAUSTIBLE: 
shaves scalp and attaches 21 
leads), adjusts manual controls 
to broad categories of mass, 
switches on the power and con- 
centrates on visualizing the ap- 
pearance and performance of a 
known end-product, or the per- 
formance of something desired 
but not hitherto invented. This 
eventually appears in the output 
hopper, or not, as the case may 
be. 

The MIDAS, CROESUS and 
WIZARD were fitted with a 
useful extra: a warning bell on 
the moderator to indicate if pro- 
duction of the article had been 
vetoed. With the slower ma- 
chines, especially the ZILLION- 
AIRE, it was sometimes possi- 
ble to hang around hopefully for 
an hour or more before realiz- 
ing that nothing would emerge. 

The CORNUCOPIA, MI- 
DAS/CROESUS and WIZARD 
draw domestic current on plan- 
ets where a piped-plasma grid 
exists; otherwise they require 
a portable fusion plant. The 
DOMESTICATED DJINN and 
ZILLIONAIRE can also be run 
off solar or other energy sourc- 
es, but performance on any- 



thing but plasma is unsatisfac- 
tory. The ZILLIONAIRE, us- 
ing solar energy, required 6)4 
hours steady concentration to 
produce a meal for two people, 
which the hungry tester then 
immediately devoured. 

The INEXHAUSTIBLE was 
unique in having to be primed 
with 12 kg. of technetium (this 
is apparently what the adver- 
tisements mean by “SELF CON- 
TAINING SAUCE OF POWER 
— OUTSIDE POWER IS NEE- 
DLES ! ! ! ”). The cost of fur- 
nishing this initial load is about 
Cr. 17,000; however, an effi- 
cient auxiliary circuit kept the 
level of fuel constant, using ther- 
mal energy from the air of the 
room, providing sufficient down- 
time was allowed. 

Performance 

Theoretically a wishing ma- 
chine will make almost any- 
thing, subject to the veto of the 
moderating tube. In practice, 
the latter is by no means con- 
sistent, and what you get out 
depends anyhow on how good 
you are at concentrating. (It 
also depends on how good the 
visualizer tube is at sifting con- 
scious from subconscious men- 
tal images.) 

It was clearly impossible to 
attempt a cross-section of users’ 
desires. We settled for three 
groups of tests. 



GALACTIC CONSUMER REPORTS 



137 



First, we had to establish that 
everyday requirements could be 
met. We instructed the testers to 
make (a) a meal for two people 
which they personally enjoyed; 
(b) clothing for themselves, from 
hat to shoes; (c) an item of 
household equipment, preferably 
furniture. 

All passed, with the following 
qualifications: 

Food produced on the initial 
runs of the CORNUCOPIA re- 
sisted knives, forks and teeth, and 
its piece of furniture (a table) 
proved to be of collapsed steel. 
We had to send for a crane to 
remove it from the output hop- 
per. Investigation showed that 
the Durability control needed 
adjustment; it was set to “101 
per cent”. A setting of 1 produced 
edible food and 25 produced 
usable furniture, in later runs. 

Clothing manufactured on the 
MIDAS was adequately warm 
and waterproof, but when we 
sent out a lady tester in the 
garments she had made, to see 
how well they wore, the next 
we heard of her she was in jail 
on a charge of indecent exposure. 
Her and all other female cloth- 
ing produced by this machine 
turned perfectly transparent one 
hour after putting on. A com- 
plaint to the makers produced 
an apology and a statement to the 
effect that the factory-hand in 
charge of this batch had been 



sent for psychotherapy to elimin- 
ate his Peeping Tom syndrome. 

All the testers who ate meals 
prepared by the DOMESTI- 
CATED DJINN were hospital- 
ized with acute food poisoning. 

The INEXHAUSTIBLE need- 
ed enormous extra effort before 
it would produce food uncon- 
taminated with bromine and 
arsenic and of any other color 
than purple (though some of 
our testers found purple steak 
and potatoes attractive visually, 
they tasted bad), or clothing less 
than 4 cm. in thickness, devoid 
of fibreglass scales and with 
sleeves less than 1.8 m. long. 

Second, we had to establish 
that it was economical to pro- 
duce household durables avail- 
able through more conventional 
channels. We tried for a three- 
vee set, and an air- conditioner. 

In all cases it was cheaper 
(sometimes 100 per cent cheap- 
er) to buy commercially. Hov/- 
ever, the following points should 
be noted: 

The CORNUCOPIA, in re- 
sponse to a tester who claimed 
not to have the faintest notion 
how a three-vee set works, pro- 
duced one in working order, 
superior to any we have ever 
seen, and based on what proved 
to be a radical new means of re- 
ceiving broadcast signals. We are 
working on this and hope short-

]y to market a commercial ver- 
sion, which may go some way 
towards making up the anticipat- 
ed deficit in next year’s balance 
sheet. (See “Message from your 
Chairman”, this issue.) 

Sets made by the ZILLION- 
AIRE would not receive any- 
thing, but merely repeated what 
the tester was visualizing at the 
time. We had to fire one tester 
whose set depicted a positively 
obscene episode from “Peyton 
Planet”. And those from the DO- 
MESTICATED DJINN would 
receive only Mecca, Medina and 
New Cairo. 

The air- conditioners mostly 
worked okay, except for the IN- 
EXHAUSTIBLES. After a few 
minutes’ operation the room was 
fuU of the reek of chlorine; in- 
spection showed that a minature 
transmuter had been set into the 
housing, which was busy getting 
rid of the oxygen in favor of 
chlorine, bromine, iodine and in- 
ert gases. 

Finally we had to determine 
how safe the machines were. 
There is no galactic standard yet, 
but an Earthside law lays down 
that the moderator must prevent 
the creation of “any noxious or 
vicious article, object or creature 
whatsoever.” Cut-outs built into 
the moderator are supposed to 
enforce this. 

In practice, it’s clear that def- 



initions vary. Even on the best 
of the machines, the CORNU- 
COPIA, all testers were able to 
make infectious bacteria (see 
Obituary, inside back cover). 
And our eight-year-old, using the 
ZILLIONAIRE, was able to 
make a spanking machine, from 
which his parents were rescued 
in a state of extreme exhaustion; 
a suit of battle armor, his own 
size, in which to make good his 
escape; and enough sleepy-gas 
to blank out the ConGalFedCon- 
Ass Building as he was leaving. 

Our performance tests of the 
INEXHAUSTIBLE were incon- 
clusive. We were tempted to 
abandon them when we discov- 
ered that although insulation 
against subconscious feedback 
left something to be desired on 
all the machines, the insulation 
on this one tended to filter out 
conscious images and let subcon- 
scious ones go through. (The 
events which led us to this im- 
pression need not be gone into 
as the tests were abortive.) 

However, we felt we owed it 
to our members to determine 
whether the extravagant claim 
implied in the trade name INEX- 
HAUSTIBLE was true or false. 
Our change of address, noted 
on the inside front cover, stems 
largely from our persistence. 

We decided to make up a 
cyclic tape for some article of 
which any family is likely to 



GALACTIC CONSUMER REPORTS 



139 



consume large quantities, and 
run it until the machine stopped 
working. Our first choice was 
paper handkerchiefs, but the 
machine’s vulnerability to sub- 
conscious associations compelled 
the Greater Greater New York 
Public Health Authority to step 
in. (We are glad to learn, just 
before press-time, that the influ- 
enza epidemic is officially “un- 
der control”.) 

It was then suggested that the 
item of which a family consumes 
most is money. 

This choice had the secondary 
advantage that the use of a wish- 
ing machine to make Galactic 
currency is counterfeiting, and 
if the machine’s moderator per- 
mitted an illegal act we would 
be compelled to inform our mem- 
bers that it was an offence to 
buy one. 

We regret to announce that on 
this test the machine performed 
flawlessly. Our calculations show 
that the technetium will run out 
when the pile of bills now cover- 
ing the site of our former head- 
quarters is about 320 meters high, 
unless a strong wind gets up, so 
the machine is not in fact “in- 
exhaustible”, but this is a slim 
consolation. (Anyone finding 
windblown bills, incidentally, is 
requested to forward them to 
the office of our Attorney for 
the Defense before the first of 
next month.) 



NOT RECOMMENDED 

We learn from the Superdrs- 
trict Attorney’s staff that an 
investigation has been made into 
the origins of the INEXHAUST- 
IBLE. It emanates from a 
space-going factory parked about 
a thousand parsecs outside the 
galaxy in the direction of An- 
dromeda. The authorities are 
proceeding on the assumption 
that it represents an economic 
assault by the dominant civiliza- 
tion of M-31. The design of it 
accords with the known charac- 
teristics of that race: they would 
be very comfortable on the slop- 
ing bench provided for the user, 
they have arms and eyes at both 
ends of their bodies and are ex- 
tremely tall, so would be able to 
operate the divided controls as 
well as to fish the end-product 
out of the top, and they prefer 
an atmosphere of chlorine, iodine, 
neon and argon. 

Do not — repeat, DO NOT — 
buy this machine! Apart from its 
being capable of an illegal act 
(counterfeiting), our advice is 
that it can only be properly con- 
trolled by an Andromedan. If 
you meet anyone who claims to 
have had no trouble with an IN- 
EXHAUSTIBLE, report him at 
once to the nearest office of the 
Galactic Bureau of Investigation. 
He’s probably an Andromedan 
spy.

A a you know, the problem with 
life is that nobody under- 
stands the situation. Nonetheless, 
we have to get through it as best 
we can. If there is a scheme to 
it all, it is sufficiently complex 
and covers sufficient spacetime 
so that only God could account 
for it. It is one of the primary 
purposes of commercial enter- 
tainment — and of art — to com- 
pensate us for the fact that none 
of us are God. It is the function 
of a statue to capture some small 
slice of something that we say 
is real, and hold it frozen for 
us to walk around and look until 
we are satisfied that we under- 
stand it. It is the function of 
a commercial novel, of the sort 
to which most science-fiction 
novels belong, to provide what 
Murray Leinster long ago called 
a “pocket universe.” In this uni- 



verse, the rules rapidly become 
comprehensible, or an assurance 
is quickly given that the rules 
will become comprehensible. 
There is a protaganist — a hero, 
or a fascinating villian, who be- 
comes the reader’s particular 
property, and whose movements, 
troubles and triumphs become 
the reader’s own. In this way 
and for some little space of time, 
the reader inhabits a comprehen- 
sible world, and escapes from 
the real one. 

This escape- into an organized 
delusion — if you will, a system- 
atic lie — is distinguishable from 
psychosis only by the fact that 
you can walk into a store and 
buy a package of it, the pack- 
age having been provided by 
someone who deals in this ser- 
vice. As you know, psychosis is 
frowned upon, whereas reading is 



141 



normall} acceptable. Thus com- 
merce does confer a certain ab- 
solution on us all. 

Some kinds of books are auto- 
matically more popular than 
others, just as some individual 
books are more popular than 
others of their same kind. This 
means, apparently, that there are 
fashions in psychosis, just as 
there are degrees to which in- 
dividual books please their read- 
ers — that is to say, provide a 
delusional system yummier than 
someone else’s delusional sys- 
tem. It might even be possible to 
psychoanalyze a particular peri- 
od of human history by running 
one’s finger down a list of the 
best sellers. Thus, simple statistics 
and grubby pennies and dimes 
lay us all upon the psychiatrist’s 
couch. Never doubt that some 
day some earnest Ph.D. candi- 
date will not do all this for us; 
hopefully, not in my time or 
yours. 

For now, come rummage 
through some pockets with me. 

/^ne of the simplest and most 
common pocket universes is 
the one in which life is fast, so- 
ciety is run on about as many 
rules as apply to tick-tack-toe, 
and if you’re imhappy you can 
go shoot somebody. To this end, 
Joseph E. Levine has made a 
motion picture called The Tenth 
Victim, from a short story by 



Robert Sheckley, and Ballantine 
in turn has had Sheckley nov- 
elize the screenplay. (The orig- 
inal story, of course, appeared in 
Gafaxy. The movie stars Marcel- 
lo Mastroianni as a pleasant but 
essentially inept huntsman in a 
world where aggressions have 
been channeled into a kind of 
game described as “a safety valve 
for humanity’s latent agressive 
instincts.” His particular oppon- 
ent in this story is Ursula An- 
dress. Ursula is a quite proficient 
huntress. We first meet her as 
she guns down her ninth victim, 
using a rapid-fire bra. Their 
names in this story are Catherine 
and Marcello. 

By the rules of the lottery in 
which registered citizens of this 
future world acquire the right 
to hunt each other, and to re- 
tire to fame and riches after 
killing their tenth victim, these 
two have now been more or less 
randomly chosen to compete. So- 
ciety, in this xmiverse, is so or- 
ganized that nothing stands in 
their way, and a number of in- 
stitutions exist to aid and en- 
courage them in their endeavors. 
There are no legal bars to their 
activities — there are almost no 
places on Earth where they may 
not take pot shots at each other 
with guns, bombs, knifes or arm- 
ed helicopters — and this is true 
to the point where the average 
poor citizen in the street nor- 



142 



GALAXY 



mally doesn’t even have any 
warning that somebody is liable 
to set off a bomb to get the man 
beside him. Accordingly, despite 
whatever rationale the author of 
such a work may offer, what this 
is is kids playing cops and rob- 
bers. 

In order to take this sort of 
story seriously, one must suspend 
considerably more disbelief than 
one needs in order to read a book 
such as The Three Musketeers. 
This is not a serious problem — 
the public eats up this kind of 
thing every day without blinking 
an eye; nevertheless, the Italian 
moviemakers, and thus Sheckley 
following along behind the script, 
have chosen to make this story 
a vehicle for satire in the Italian 
manner typified in such famous 
productions as La Dolce Vita 
and Syi. 

As you may have noticed, in 
order to understand La Dolce 
Vita and you have to be 

“in.” Otherwise you are in seri- 
ous danger of losing some of the 
subtleties and the really master- 
ful symbolic touches which make 
an indifferent and often boring 
story into a masterpiece of art. 
Now personally, I have actually 
had the privilege of seeing a 
roomful of these “in” people at 
a private preview showing of 
Syi, and I must say it took them 
two or three hours to decide what 
the masterful touches were. My 



opinion is that if I have march- 
ed down to a drug store and 
handed somebody 60c for a book 
or into a movie house and hand- 
ed somebody $1.80 to have the 
silver screen do most of my im- 
agining for me — badly — - I 
would prefer to get my return 
for value received on the spot, 
and without the need to go hunt 
up 180 others of my own kind 
in order to arrive at a consen- 
sus. Thus my tendency on being 
handed a book is to simply read 
it and notice while I am doing 
so whether I’m enjoying myself 
or not. My buying judgments 
of books lined up on a rack and 
offered for sale are formed on 
the same basis. I look at the 
cover design, I read the title, 
I read the blurbs. I turn the 
book over and skim rapidly over 
the back cover copy which, if 
carefully read, often tells me 
entirely too much about some 
of the surprises the author has 
planned to hand me, and then 
I am liable to flip a few pages 
and run my eye along a few 
paragraphs, just to see how well 
acquainted the writer is with 
prose. 

My thinking in this area is that 
the publisher either is or is not 
a good professional and that the 
writer either is or is not the 
same, and what I am I after here, 
after all, is a professional ser- 
vice. Thus in glancing at Bal- 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



143 



lantine’s package on The Tenth 
Victim, I find a very well execut- 
ed jacket which tells me: “a 
bullseye view of guns and lovers! 
Robert Sheckley’s chiUing futur- 
ama of legalized manslaughter.” 
As you may have noticed, the 
package describes a book rather 
different from the book actually 
contained within its covers. 
There is no hint of satire, nor of 
symbolism. There is a picture 
of Urusla Andress with the cross- 
hairs of a gunsight centered 
somewhere south of her navel, 
and if this is satire I will take 
broccoli. So, rectitudinously ig- 
noring the reams of promotional 
literature which Ballantine sends 
to its review list, I plowed into 
this book and read it as I would 
have had I stumbled across it 
at the comer bookie’s. 

Read as a genuinely proffered 
pocket universe, this is a reas- 
onably good chase novel which 
suffers from the fact that its 
protaganist, Marcello, doesn’t 
really want to do any shooting, 
and doesn’t really care if he 
gets shot or not. Ursula Andress, 
last prominently seen as the 
bikinied Honey in the motion 
picture Dr. No, goes through this 
book in the guise of Catherine 
just as deadpan as she was in 
the Ian Fleming movie, but with- 
out the utterly redeeming quality 
of being outstandingly visible. 

There are some very nice, fun- 



ny touches in the story. I don’t 
know who contributed them, but 
Sheckley is quite capable of ex- 
tremely good tongue-in-cheek 
deadpan humor on his own hook. 
There are some improbable and 
yet interesting visual effects 
described, as when the hut in 
which Marcello is resting is hook- 
ed to a helicopter and transport- 
ed bodily to the Roman Coli- 
seum, where its sides fall away 
in order that the climatic shoot- 
ing of Marcello by Catherine 
may be covered by network tele- 
vision and dressed up as a Spec- 
tacular with the addition of bal- 
let dancers and other marvelous 
effects. Nevertheless, you are 
liable to be disappointed by this 
book, no matter which way you 
approach it. If you wish to ac- 
quire in permanent form, a pre- 
viously received cinematographic 
impression, you will get most 
of it from the inserted section of 
movie stills showing such things 
as Catherine’s exploding bras- 
siere and Marcello at the camp 
of the sun worshippers. (You are 
liable to be confused, as I was, 
by seeing that in the photo 
captions Ursula Andress is call- 
ed Christine, that in the back 
cover blurb, she is called Cather- 
ine — which is the style I have 
been following, in my own slip- 
shod way — and that in the 
actual text, which is presumably 
the way either Shecklfey or Jo-

seph E. Levine wanted it, she 
is called Caroline. But obviously 
it doesn’t matter.) If you are 
really after a chilling futurama 
of legalized murder (not man- 
slaughter), you are going to be 
put off by the book’s rather 
flaky final chapters. 

This book is primarily inter- 
esting not for what it is but for 
what it represents; the successful 
translation of a Galaxy Maga- 
zine short story called “Seventh 
Victim” into a major motion pic- 
ture, starring some extremely ex- 
pensive and skilled actors, using 
the resources of a major pro- 
duction company. This is not 
common, and probably represents 
Sheckley’s accession, at last, into 
the larger world of high-paying, 
internationally accepted com- 
mercial work. There have been 
a number of very flossy science- 
fiction movies made, but this one 
is one of the very few in which 
money was spent on actors as 
well as production values. Most 
important, this motion picture 
represents the first clearly ob- 
vious top-line production effort 
by the European moviemakers 
and crews who have been taken 
up by the highly verbal “in” 
crowd — as a result, you may 
be sure that The Tenth Victim, 
and with it Robert Sheckley, 
will receive a great deal of criti- 
cal attention, and that a num- 
ber of imitations will be attempt- 



ed. I am very glad to see this, 
because it represents a potential 
exploration of another world into 
w'hich category magazine science 
fiction, and other category maga- 
zine science-fiction writers can 
expand. 

/^ne of the favorite pocket 
universes is the one in which 
nameless and overwhelming hor- 
ror lurks behind every closet 
door and under every antimacas- 
sar. Some years ago, Theodore L. 
Thomas wrote a short story call- 
ed “The Clone”, which might 
very well have been called “The 
Thing from the Drain”. He and 
Kate Wilhelm have now ex- 
panded this to a novel of the 
same title, and Berkley has 
published it. 

The clone is a living organism 
which results from a chance com- 
bination of lifeless ingredients 
in the catch basin of a Chicago 
drain. By a perfectly believable 
combination of circumstances 
these various chemicals are 
warmed and nurtured to the 
point where a living cell begins 
to feed, react to stimuli and 
multiply. It then grows through 
the Chicago sewer system — and 
I am perfectly prepared to be- 
lieve it has been there for years 
— chomping voraciously on 
everything it considers edible. 
Because its chemistry is some- 
what different from ours, when it 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



145 



chomps on people, or, rather, ab- 
sorbs them into its tissue, it re- 
jects approximately seventy per 
cent of their water content.. Thus 
while these people and the read- 
er dissolve, a freshet of slightly 
brackish water pours from the 
advancing line of clone tissue 
working its way through flesh 
and muscle, blood and bone, eat- 
ing the animal-organic clothing 
worn by the unfortunate victim, 
rejecting such items as cotton. 
After a while, all that remains is 
a puddle of water with a T- 
shirt floating in it. When you 
translate this into a department 
storeful of victims, with the 
clone grown up to the point 
where it covers an area miles 
square, this becomes a flood, a 
cataract, a torrent of warmish, 
mineral laden water cascading 
down the stairways, escalators 
and elevator shafts, spilling out 
into the street and choking the 
gutters. As the clone consumes 
its food supply, it begins to hunt 
for new sources of energy and 
nutriment. It develops the ability 
to shoot pseudopods in all dir- 
ections. It develops the ability 
to extract nourishment from ma- 
terials it had previously dis- 
dained, such as the lath behind 
a plaster wall, and the various 
other organic material associated 
with building materials. As a 
result, not only people but build- 
ings, and all the other accoutre- 



ments of normal civilization, be- 
gin to totter and dissolve into 
the green heaving mass of the 
insenate clone. 

This story of the thing that 
makes a mockery of all the 
works of Man and Man himself, 
in part because it is omnipotent, 
in larger part because it deserves 
no respect and is therefore. aU 
the more unreasonable in its 
pKDwer, is one of the favorite poc- 
ket psychoses with which people 
have been titillating themselves 
for generations. In times earlier 
than that, of course, the function 
of the clone was subsumed un- 
der the lesser duties of certain 
gods. This present example, to 
my mind is a very good one. My 
reasons for thinking so are that 
someone has worked out the 
chemistry of the clone, (Thomas 
is not only a patent attorney but 
an M.I.T. graduate), and the per- 
sonalities of some of the charac- 
ters who come in contact with the 
clone, (Kate Wilhelm does well 
with people under stress), with 
a quiet, technical competence 
that makes them rather convinc- 
ing. There are few people in this 
book who run around screaming 
that this whole thing is a visita- 
tion for the Sins of Mankind, 
and there are few people who 
waste a great deal of time des- 
cribing the green monstrosity as 
“Evil!” A great many of them 
quietly and systematically an- 



146 



GALAXY 



alyze the beast’s properties and 
behavior patterns even while it 
is eating them. This may not 
make for obvious screaming ten- 
sion, but I think it creates a 
more enduring impression of 
what happens to people in the 
face of something that guzzles 
them up despite aU their piety 
and wit. 

There is a hero in this story of 
course, and a heroine. They 
spend very little time clutching 
at each other, and in fact quite 
often are nowhere near each other 
as they move around the dty 
of Chicago in the course of var- 
ious attempts at rescue and bat- 
tle. There is no particular vin- 
dication of a personal creed in 
the final victory over the clone. 
That is to say, when the clone 
is finally subdued, it does not 
prove the smart young techni- 
cian Right, nor does it prove sup- 
erstition Wrong. This is a sort 
of horror-procedural novel, in 
which people do more or less 
the best they can more or less 
consistently, and some of them 
turn out to be very heroic, while 
others turn out to be prosaic. 

This is mostly nice circum- 
stantial writing, of the sort that 
either Wilhelm or Thomas do 
very well all by themselves. I 
think that if you are going to 
read yourself a book describing 
a world which is in some way pre- 
ferable to this one because the 



monsters in it are visible and 
describable, that this is a book 
for you. 

F inally we have The Squares 
of the City by John Brunner 
(Ballantine). 

Even more pernicious than the 
sophistry that life is like chess 
is the fallacy that a chess game 
is like a story. I was going to 
discourse with you at great 
length on the crucial differences 
between life and chess, as I see 
them, but after many pages of 
winding up to do so, I dis- 
covered on reaching the back end 
of Brunner’s book that he was 
going to make all those points 
himself all along. This move on 
Brunner’s part was particularly 
startling since the inside and 
outside of the book are plastered 
with urgent references to the 
fact that the entire plot of the 
book is modeled on an actual 
chess game played in Havana in 
1892 between the mastem Steinitz 
and Tchigorin. The publishers 
and Brunner seem convinced 
that this alone removes all doubt 
we have a literary classic on our 
hands. 

Although Brunner understands 
about life and chess, he seems 
not to have understood about 
chess and stories. Possibly this 
entire thing is a response to a 
years-old complaint by James 
Blish who, in reviewing a Poul 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



147 



Anderson short story written 
around an imaginary chess game 
— which Blish found particular- 
ly uninspiring — complained that 
if you were going to do this kind 
of thing at all you should at 
least have the wit to use an 
actual game, and furthermore 
not a pedestrian one. Brunner 
seems to have taken up this 
challenge, and in his preface says 
things like this; “Following an 
introductory section, the action 
of the story goes move -for -move 
with a famous chess game, every 
piece on the board having a 
human counterpart.” (Italics 
Brunner’s). “Ever since Lewis 
CarroU wrote Through the Look- 
ing Gl^, fantasy authors have 
been fascinated by the chess 
game fantasy. I honestly be- 
lieve this is the most successful 
of its kind so far ... I do not 
think there is any artificiality or 
contrivance apparent, and this 
story can be read on either of 
two levels — by the chess ad- 
dict with the game beside him 
for reference, or by anyone else 
for its own sake.” 

Well, I don’t know about the 
chess addict, since I am not one, 
but I seriously doubt the second 
half of Brunner’s proposition. 
Read as a story for its own sake, 
this is a confusing, overpopulated, 
almost unindentifiable-with story 
set in a city which seems to 
have been created for the sole 



purpose of letting Brunner set 
a “human chess game” in mo- 
tion upon it. 

As you know, there are thirty- 
two pieces on a chess board, and 
in the particular game used as a 
model here there were thirty- 
eight moves. Even for a book 
which occupies 307 pages of very 
closely set text, it has too many 
plot turns, too many characters 
to follow. As usual when a com- 
mercial author of average com- 
petence attempts to write a book 
this long, around as ambitious a 
plan as this, many parts of the 
final third of the book are skim- 
py narrations of events which 
would have been detailed with 
loving care and attention had 
they occurred in the earlier parts 
of the manuscript when the auth- 
or was still fresh. This is not to 
say that the average commercial 
writer is not as skilled as the 
average writer of novels project- 
ed for a more ambitious reason. 
It is to say that if he writes 
for a living at commercial rates, 
he does not have time enough, 
and that he will save himself a 
number of ambitious failures, 
and considerable grief and heart- 
ache, if he takes this factor into 
account. He will also not parti- 
cipate in what often uncomfort- 
ably amounts to an ingratiating 
and naive attempt to take mon- 
ey from the reader under false 
pretenses.

Now I have been questioned 
in the past about my tendency 
to review not only the text of 
a book, but the blurbs thereon 
and all the other appurtenances 
such as forewords, afterwords, in- 
dexes and appendices which go 
to make up the entire package. 
However, it seems to me — as 
it does to you — that when we 
walk into a store with the in- 
tention of spending money on 
books, what usually determines 
our choice is what the books look 
like, and what written informa- 
tion is immediately and readily 
available to us on its outside 
surfaces, rather than anything 
that may be going on inside. 

Thus I want to know what 
justification Ballantine has for 
blurbing this as “one of the ten 
best science fiction novels of the 
year.” I want to know why it 
wasn’t nine, or eleven, or one 
hundred and forty-four. I want 
to know why Ballantine has seen 
fit to append to the back cover 
a statement which goes into 
paroxysms of delight that the 
last times they described some- 
thing as “one of the ten best” 
they were speaking of Edgar 
Pangborn’s Davy, a reprint, and 
of Leiber’s The Wanderer, a 
book that could not miss with 
the coterie readership, for cot- 
erie reasons. This novel is not 
one of the ten best of anything. 
It is an interesting, professional- 



ly written, more or less profes- 
sionally produced package sell- 
ing for 75c, and that is all it 
it. The author does not have the 
previous reputation of either 
Pangborn or Fritz Leiber (who 
won a Hugo for himself and Bal- 
lantine with The Wanderer'), and 
it is frankly and objectively not 
in the class of a book written 
by the two previously named 
commercial artists. Brunner is a 
workaday technician with an ex- 
aggerated sense of how much of 
his intelligence and awareness of 
the world gets translated into the 
prose he turns out. These are 
as close to being verified facts 
as opinions can ever be, and I’m 
a little bit disappointed in Bal- 
lantine. 

Ballantine, which previously 
participated in the screw-up on 
the name of the heroine in The 
Tenth Victim, has this time 
screwed up the name of the 
hero throughout the Page One 
blurb on The Squares of the 
City. Without fail, they call him 
“Haklyut” five times. They nev- 
er do call him “Hakluyt” which 
is not only what the author calls 
him, but what the author knew 
and was careful to note in the 
story itself as a famous name. 
I will be damned if I will let 
this type of editorial careless- 
ness go by unnoticed. It is im- 
portant that the packages be 
professionally and carefully

done, because if they are not, a 
worthy text may suffer for it. 
Even if the text is not worthy 
(Shackley’s may be, Brunner’s 
not only may be, but at least 
represents an enormous amount 
of labor, a high degree of intel- 
ligence and considerable person- 
al involvement), a series of slip- 
shod packages from a publisher 
will impair the sales, and thus 
the popularity and reputation, 
of other writers whose books ap- 
pear under the same imprint. In 
their choice of blurbs, blurb 
writers, editors, and of any pre- 
vious reviews they may wish to 
quote on the covers of their 
books, the publishers speak not 
only for the book contained 
therein, but for themselves, for 
all the writers on their list, and 
for aU writers generally, in more 
or less that order of effectiveness. 
It costs no more to do it right 
than it does to do it wrong. 

As far as the story itself goes, 
there is considerable interesting 
thinking to be derived from it. 
Boyd Hakluyt is a traffic analyst 
— a man whose specialty is that 
of analyzing the flowi of human 
beings and their personal and 
service vehicles through a city, 
for the purpose of arriving at in- 
telligent plans for channelling 
this flow. The work done as a 
result of Hakluyt’s professional 
service does not consist merely 
of putting up a new throughway 



or a stop sign; various unob- 
trusive psychological devices 
such as making a street a little 
bit more attractive to drive 
through, or a little bit less so, 
are used to increase or decrease 
the speed with which traffic will 
feed along a given route. Fur- 
thermore, the layout of a street 
system can be used to create 
areas in which it is more natural 
to put up one kind of shopping 
center, or residential area, in 
preference to any other. I find 
this an interesting occupational 
specialty, and consider it a legi- 
timate vehicle for science-fiction 
exploration. 

There are also a very few but 
effective scenes which attain a 
certain pictorial splendor, such 
as the climactic looting and des- 
truction in the city to which 
Hakluyt has come. The city is 
Ciudad Vados, in the fictional 
Latin American country of 
Aguazul. Ciudad Vados, like con- 
temporary Brasilia, is an artifi- 
cially created city carved new 
and shiny out of previously bar- 
ren ground at the decree of a 
strong and single-minded ruler. 
Ciudad Vados is, in the story, 
famous throught the world as 
the most modem city on the face 
of the Earth, and of course was 
planned exhaustively before 
ever a stick was cleared or foot- 
ing dug. In consequence, the 
expectation was that the city 



150 



GALAXY 



would be a flawless place in 
which to live, work and govern. 

In actual practice however, the 
construction of the city, and the 
subsequent drain on the resourc- 
es of the countryside, have dis- 
placed and discommoded the 
native peasant population of 
Aguazul. Some of these peasants 
have remained out in the coun- 
tryside, or in the older, organ- 
ically evolved cities of the land, 
where they live in squalor and 
discontent. Others have moved 
into the city, and set up mark- 
ets, shacks, warrens and rook- 
eries of tin, plywood and paper 
wherever they can find room to 
do so — in one instance, inter- 
lacing their squalid dwellings 
among the supporting girders un- 
der the main monorail station. 

Like mantis eggs and tent 
caterpillar cocoons on a rock 
crystal mulberry tree carved for 
a Chinese emperor’s delectation, 
these pests and infestations cause 
no end of anguish to Vados, the 
dictator who originally decreed 
this plea.sure dome, and furnish 
no end of kindling for various 
political flare-ups which go on 
and on in Ciudad Vados just 
as if it were, for example, Brasi- 
lia. Hakluyt takes it as his con- 
tract to simply solve the traffic 
flow problems. Vados takes it 
as his job to create artificial 
traffic flows right through the 
areas of peasant infestation, so 



as to furnish a convenient, mod- 
em, up-to-date, and most im- 
portant, outside excuse to wipe 
out the paisanos. 

Hakluyt gets caught up in the 
vicious political quarrels which 
are taking place between the 
representatives of Vado’s adher- 
ents and the representatives of 
the peasantry. Eventually the 
peasants rise in revolt, and there 
is a lot of hurrahing and shout- 
ing, from which Hakluyt begins 
to flee, but to which he returns 
at the last moment because he 
has become transformed from 
the detached, neutral, salaried 
expert to a human being more or 
less passionately involved in the 
fate of people as distinguished 
from the flow of traffic units. 

From the point of view of 
literary criticism, Hakluyt’s 
transformation comes too late, 
too abruptly, apparently because 
the book was getting to be too 
damn long. His love interest, 
which was aroused briefly at 
the very beginning of the book, 
is not at all convincing when it 
recurs at the end. It seems to re- 
cur at the end only because, 
what the hell, you’ve got to have 
a love interest. What happens 
in between is considerably clum- 
sier than one might like to have 
it. 

If you were going to plot a 
story to correspond to a chess 
game, in which pieces moved to- 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



15 > 



ward the removal from the board 
of themselves or of other pieces, 
and if some of them are at the 
very outset of the game assigned 
an arbitrary order of importance 
which has nothing to do with 
any capacity for growth but only 
with arbitrary abilities to change 
position, you are going to have 
a whole lot of monolithic charac- 
ters introduced who are built up 
to considerable extent only to be 
wiped off suddenly by murder, 
suicide and kidnapping. When 
this has to happen to ten or a 
dozen principal characters, let 
me assure you that the tenth 
victim seems nowhere near as 
interesting in his agony as did 
the first. 

What happens if we strip away 
the chess game gimmick is that 
the protoganist, who tells the 
story in the first person, is real- 
ly a nasty young man who hap- 
pens to have a marketable skill, 
and who is forever insisting upon 
his rights, who is sent to a coun- 



try that does not exist and a 
city that does not exist to deal 
with people who do not exist, 
and who thinks of all of them, 
very nearly to the absolute ut- 
ter very end, as just so many 
units. There is nothing in par- 
ticular here to catch and hold 
the reader’s involvement in a 
universe which he might like to 
enter. In fact, he is led to suspect 
that if he did enter it, Hakluyt 
would be standing there with 
his clipboard, sharply question- 
ing him as to his motives, point 
of origin and destination — three 
questions that people who 
read books are hoping to escape 
answering. 

Pocket universes are all well 
and good. I am fond of them, 
both commercially and personal- 
ly, but pocket universes should 
not have signs all over them 
reading “Pocket Universe!” and 
pocket universes should not have 
a visible fold down the middle.

When I Was Miss Dow 

by SONYA DORMAN 



Once it was a human being 
— now if preyed on theml 



^'T^hese hungry, mother-haunted 
people come and find us liv- 
ing in what they like to call 
crystal palaces, though really we 
live in glass places, some of them 
highly ornamented and others 
plain as paper. They come first 
as explorers, and perhaps realize 
we are a race of one sex only, 
rather amorphous beings of pro- 
teide; and we, even baby I, are 
Protean, also, being able to take 
various shapes at will. One sex, 
one brain lobe, we live in more 
or less glass bridges over the 
humanoid chasm, eating, recreat- 
ing, attending races and playing 
other games like most living 
creatures. 

Eventually, we’re all dumped 
into the cell banks and reproduc- 
ed once more. 

After the explorers comes the 

153 



colony of miners and scientists. 
The warden and some of the 
other elders put on faces to greet 
them, agreeing to help with the 
mining of some ores, even giving 
them a koota or two as they be- 
come interested in our racing 
dogs. They set up their places 
of life, pop up their machines, 
bang-bang, chug-chug; we put 
on our faces, forms, smiles and 
costumes; I am old enough to 
learn to change my shape, too. 

The Warden says to me, “It’s 
about time you made a change, 
yourself. Some of your friends 
are already working for these 
people, bringing home credits 
and sulfas.” 

My Uncle (by the Warden’s 
fourth conjunction) made him- 
self over at the start, being one 
of the first to realize how it 
could profit us. 



1 protest to the Warden, “I’m 
educated and trained as a scho- 
lar. You always say I must re- 
main deep in my mathematics 
and other studies.” 

My Uncle says, “You have 
to do it. There’s only one way 
for us to get along with them,” 
and he runs his fingers through 
his long blonde hair. My Uncle’s 
not an educated person, but 
highly placed, politically, and 
while Captain Dow is around 
my Uncle retains this particular 
shape. The Captain is shipping 
out soon, then Uncle will find 
some other features, because he’s 
already warned that it’s unseem- 
ly for him to be chasing around 
in the face of a girl after the 
half-bearded boys from the space 
ships. I don’t want to do this my- 
self, wasting so much time, when 
the fourteen decimals even now 
are clicking on my mirrors. 

The Warden says. “We have a 
pattern from a female botanist, 
she ought to do for you. But be- 
fore we put you into the pattern 
tank, you’ll have to approximate 
another brain lobe. They have 
two.” 

“I know,” I say, sulkily. A bot- 
anist. A she! 

“Into the tank,” the Warden 
says to me without mercy, and I 
am his to use as he believes 
proper. 

I spend four days in the tank 
absorbing the female Terran pat- 



tern. When I’m released, the 
Warden tells me, “Your job is 
waiting for you. We went to a 
lot of trouble to arrange it.” He 
sounds brusque, but perhaps this 
is because he hasn’t conjoined 
for a long time. The responsibil- 
ities of being Warden of Mines 
and Seeds come first, long be- 
fore any social engagement. 

I run my fingers through my 
brunette curls, and notice my 
Uncle is looking critically at me. 
“Haven’t you made yourself 
rather old?” he asks. 

“Oh, he’s all right,” the War- 
den says. “Thirty-three isn’t 
badly matched to the Doctor, as 
I understand it.” 

Dr. Arnold Proctor, the co- 
lony’s head biologist, is busy 
making radiograph pictures (with 
his primitive X-rays) of skeletal 
structures : murger birds, rodents, 
and our pets and racers, the 
kootos — dogs to the Terrans, 
who are fascinated by them. We 
breed them primarily for speed 
and stamina, but some of them 
carry a gene for an inherited 
structural defect which cripples 
them and they have to be de- 
stroyed before they are full 
grown. The Doctor is making a 
special study of kootas. 

He gets up from his chair when 
I enter his office. “I’m Miss 
Dow, your new assistant,” I say, 
hoping my long fingernails will 
stand up to the pressure of 



154 



GALAXY 



punch keys on the computer, 
since I haven’t had much prac- 
tise in retaining foreign shapes. 
I’m still in uncertain balance be- 
tween myself and Martha Dow, 
who is also myself. But one does 
not have two lobes for nothing, 
I discover. 

“Good morning. I’m glad 
you’re here,” the Doctor says. 

He is a nice, pink man, with 
silver hair, soft-spoken, intelli- 
gent. I’m pleased, as we work 
along, to find he doesn’t joke and 
wisecrack like so many of the 
Terrans, though I am sometimes 
whimsical. I like music and ban- 
quets as well as my studies. 

Though absorbed in his work. 
Dr. Proctor isn’t rude to inter- 
rupters. A man of unusual bal- 
ance, coming as he does from a 
culture which sends out scientif- 
ic parties that are ninety per 
cent of one sex, when their spec- 
ies provides them with two. At 
first meetings he is dedicated 
but agreeable, and I’m charmed. 

“Dr. Proctor,” I ask him one 
morning. “Is it possible for you 
to radiograph my koota? She’s 
very fine, from the fastest stock 
available, and I’d like to breed 
her.” 

“Yes, yes, of course,” he prom- 
ises with his quick, often absent, 
smile. “By all means. You wish 
to breed only the best.” It’s typ- 
ical of him to assume we’re all as 
dedicated as he. 



My Uncle’s not pleased,. 
“There’s nothing wrong with 
your koota,” he says. “What do 
you want to X-ray her for? Sup- 
pose he finds something is 
wrong? You’ll be afraid to race or 
breed her, and she won’t be re- 
placed. Besides, your interest in 
her may make him suspicious.” 
“Suspicious of what?” I ask, 
but my Uncle won’t say, so I ask 
him, “Suppose she’s bred and her 
pups are cripples?” 

The Warden says, “You’re 
supposed to have your mind on 
your work, not on racing. The 
koota was just to amuse you 
when you were younger.” 

I lean down and stroke her 
head, which is beautiful, and she 
breathes a deep and gentle 
breath in response. 

“Oh, let him go,” my Uncle 
says wearily. He’s getting dis- 
gusted because they didn’t in- 
tend for me to bury myself in a 
laboratory or a computer room, 
without making more important 
contacts. But a scholar is born 
with a certain temperament, and 
has an introspective nature, and 
as I’m destined to eventually re- 
place the Warden, naturally I 
prefer the life of the mind. 

“I must say,” my Uncle re- 
marks, “you look the image of a 
Terran female. Is the work inter- 
esting?” 

“Oh, yes, fascinating,” I reply, 
and he snorts at my lie, since we 



WHEN I WAS MISS DOW 



155 



both know it’s dull and routine, 
and most of the time is spent 
working out the connections be- 
tween my two brain lobes, which 
still present me with some diffi- 
culty. 

TV /T y koota bitch is subjected to 
a pelvic radiograph. After- 
wards, I stand on my heels in the 
small, darkened cubicle, looking 
at the film on the viewing screen. 
There he stands, too, with his 
cheekbones emerald in the pecul- 
iar light, and his hair, which is 
silver in daylight, looks phos- 
phorescent. I resist this. I am re- 
sisting this Doctor with the X- 
ray eyes who can examine my 
marrow with ease. He sees Mar- 
tha’s marrow, every perfect cor- 
puscle of it. 

You can’t imagine how com- 
forting it is to be so transparent. 
There’s no need to pretend, ad- 
just, advance, retreat or discuss 
the oddities of my planet. We are 
looking at the X-ray film of my 
prized racer and companion to 
determine the soundness of her 
hip joints, yet I suspect the Doc- 
tor, platinum-green and tall as a 
tower, is piercing my reality with 
his educated gaze. He can see 
the blood flushing my surfaces. 
I don’t need to do a thing but 
stand up straight so the crease 
of fat at my waist won’t distort 
my belly button, the center of it 
all. 



“You see?” he says. 

I do see, looking at the film in 
the darkness where perfection or 
disaster may be viewed, and I’m 
twined in the paradox which con- 
fronts me here. The darker the 
room, the brighter the screen and 
the clearer the picture. Less 
light! and the truth becomes 
more evident. Either the koota 
is properly jointed and may be 
bred without danger of passing 
the gene on to her young, or she 
is not properly jointed, and can- 
not be used. Less light, more 
truth! And the Doctor is green 
sculpture — a little darker and he 
would be a bronze — but his nat- 
ural color is pink alabaster, 

“You see,” the Doctor says, 
and I do try to see. He points 
his wax pencil at one hip joint 
on the film, and says, “A certain 
amount of osteo-arthritic build- 
up is already evident. The cran- 
ial rim is wearing down, she may 
go lame. She’ll certainly pass the 
defect on to some of her pups, if 
she’s bred.” 

This koota has been my play- 
mate and friend for a long time. 
She retains a single form, that of 
koota, full of love and beautiful 
speed; she has been a source of 
pleasure and pride. 

Dr. Proctor, of the pewter hair, 
will discuss the anatomical de- 
fects of the koota in a gentle and 
cultivated voice. I am disturbed. 
There shouldn’t be any need to 



156 



GALAXY 



explain the truth, which is evi- 
dent. Yet it seems that to com- 
prehend the exposures, I require 
a special education. It’s said that 
the more you have seen, the 
quicker you are to sort the eter- 
nal verities into one pile and the 
dismal illusions into another. 
How is it that sometimes the 
Doctor wears a head which re- 
sembles that of a koota, with a 
splendid muzzle and noble brow? 

Suddenly he gives a little 
laugh and points the end of the 
wax pencil at my navel, announ- 
cing: “There. There, it is essen- 
tial that the belly button onto 
the pelvis, or you’ll bear no chil- 
dren.” Thoughts of offspring had 
occurred to me. But weren’t we 
discussing my racer? The radio- 
graph film is still clipped to the 
view screen, and upon it, spread- 
eagled, appears the bony Rors- 
chach of my koota bitch, her hip 
joints expressing doom. 

I wish the Doctor would put 
on the daylight. I come to the 
conclusion that there’s a limit 
to how much truth I can ex- 
amine, and the more I submit to 
the conditions necessary for ex- 
amining it, the more unhappy I 
become. 

'T\r. Proctor is a man of such 
perfect integrity that he 
continues to talk about bones 
and muscles until I’m ready to 
scream for mercy. He has done 



something that is unusual and 
probably prohibited, but he’s not 
aware of it. I mean it must be 
prohibited in his culture, where 
it seems they play on each other, 
but not with each other. I am 
uneasy, fluctuating. 

He snaps two switches. Out 
goes the film and on goes the 
sun, making my eyes stream with 
sensitive and grateful tears, al- 
though he’s so adjusted to these 
contrasts he doesn’t so much as 
blink. Floating in the sunshine 
Fve become opaque. He can’t see 
anything but my surface ten- 
sions, and I wonder what he does 
in his spare time. A part of me 
seems to tilt, or slide. 

“There, there, oh dear. Miss 
Dow,” he says, patting my back, 
rubbing my shoulder blades. His 
forearms and fingers extend gin- 
gerly. “You do want to breed 
only the best, don’t you?” he 
asks. I begin within me a com- 
pulsive ritual of counting the ele- 
ments; it’s all I can do to keep 
communications open between 
my brain lobes. I’m suffering 
from eclipses: one goes dark, the 
other lights up, that one goes 
dark, the other goes nova. 

“There, there,” the Doctor 
says, distressed because I’m 
quivering and trying to keep the 
connections open; I have never 
felt clogged before. They may 
have to put me back into the 
pattern tank. 



WHEN I WAS MISS DOW 



157 



Profoundly disturbed, I lift my 
face, and he gives me a kiss. 
Then I’m all right, balanced 
again, one lobe composing a con- 
certo for virtix flute, the other 
one projecting, “Oh Arnie, oh 
Arnie.” Yes, I’m okay for the 
shape I’m in. He’s marking my 
joints with his wax pencil (the 
marks of which can be easily 
erased from the film surface) 
and he’s mumbling, “It’s essen- 
tial, oh yes, it’s essential.” 

Finally he says, “I guess all 
of us colonists are lonely here,” 
and I say, “Oh yes, aren’t we,” 
before I realize the enormity of 
the Warden’s manipulations, and 
what a lot I have to learn. Evi- 
dently the Warden triple-carded 
me through the Colony Punch 
Center as a Terran. I lie and say, 
“Oh, yes. Yes, yes. Oh, Arnie, 
put out the light,” for we may 
find some more truth. 

“Not here,” Arnie says, and of 
course he’s right. This is a room 
for study, for cataloguing obvious 
facts, not a place for carnival. 
There are not many places for 
it, I discover with surprise. Hav- 
ing lived in glass all my life I ex- 
pect everyone else to be as com- 
fortable there as I am but this 
isn’t so. 

Just the same we find his quar- 
ters, after dark, to be comfort- 
able and free of embarrassment. 
You wouldn’t think a dedicated 
man of his age would be so vig- 



orous, but I find out he spends 
his weekends at the recreation 
center hitting a ball with his 
hand. The ball bounces back off 
a wall and he hits it and hits it. 
Though he’s given that up now 
because we’re together on week- 
ends. 

“You’re more than an old 
bachelor like me deserves,” he 
tells me. 

“Why are you an old bach- 
elor?” I ask him. I do wonder 
why, if it’s something not to be. 

He tries to explain it to me. 
“I’m not a young man. I 
wouldn’t make a good husband, 
I’m afraid. I like to work late, to 
be undisturbed. In my leisure 
time, I like to make wood carv- 
ings. Sometimes I go to bed with 
the sun and sometimes I’m up 
working all night. And then chil- 
dren. No. I’m lucky to be an old 
bachelor,” he says. 

A rnie carves kaku wood, which 
has a brilliant grain and is 
soft enough to permit easy carv- 
ing. He’s working on a figure of 
a murger bird, whittling length- 
wise down the wood so the grain, 
wavy, full of flowing, wedge- 
shaped lines, will represent the 
feathers. The lamp light shines 
on his hair and the crinkle of his 
eyelids as he looks down and 
carves, whittles, turns. He’s ab- 
sorbed in what he doesn’t see 
there but he’s projecting what he 



158 



GALAXY 



wants to see. It’s the reverse of 
what he must do in the viewing 
room. I begin to suffer a peculiar 
pain, located in the nerve cluster 
between my lungs. He’s not talk- 
ing to me. He’s not carressing 
me. He’s forgotten I’m here, and 
like a false projection, I’m begin- 
ning to fade. In another hour 
perhaps the film will become 
blank. If he doesn’t see me, then 
am I here? 

He’s doing just what I do when 
absorbed in one of my own pro- 
jects, and I admire the intensity 
with which he works: it’s mag- 
nificent. Yes, I’m jealous of it. I 
burn with rage and jealousy. He 
has abandoned me to be Martha 
and I wish I were myself again, 
free in shape and single in mind. 
Not this sack of mud clinging to 
another. Yet he’s teaching me 
that it’s good to cling to another. 
I’m exhausted from strange dis- 
ciplines. Perhaps he’s tired, too; 
I see that sometimes he kneads 
the muscles of his stomach with 
his hands, and closes his eyes. 

The Warden sits me down on 
one of my rare evenings home, 
and talks angrily. “You’re mak- 
ing a mistake,” he says. “If the 
Doctor finds out what you are, 
you’ll lose your job with the col- 
ony. Besides, we never supposed 
you’d have a liaison with only 
one man. You were supposed to 
start with the Doctor, and go on 
from there. We need every credit 



you can bring in. And by the 
way, you haven’t done well on 
that score lately. Is he stingy?” 
“Of course he isn’t.” 

“But all you bring home in 
credits is your pay.” 

I can think of no reply. It’s 
true the Warden has a right to 
use me in whatever capacity 
would serve us all best, as I will 
use others when I’m a Warden, 
but he and my Uncle spend half 
the credits from my job on sul- 
fadiazole, to which they’ve be- 
come addicted. 

“You’ve no sense of responsi- 
bility,” the Warden says. Per- 
haps he’s coming close to time 
for conjunction again, and this 
makes him more concerned about 
my stability. 

My Uncle says, “Oh, he’s 
young, leave him alone. As long 
as he turns over most of those 
pay credits to us. Though what 
he uses the remainder for. I’ll 
never know.” 

I use it for clothes at the Col- 
ony Exchange. Sometimes Arnie 
takes me out for an evening, us- 
ually to the Laugh Tree Bar, 
where the space crews, too, like 
to relax. The bar is the place to 
find joy babies; young, pretty, 
planet-born girls who work at the 
Colony Punch Center during the 
day, and spend their evenings 
here competing for the atten- 
tion of the officers. Sitting here 
with Amie, I can’t distinguish a 



WHEN I WAS MISS DOW 



159 



colonist’s daughter from one of 
my friends or relatives. They 
wouldn’t know me, either. 

Once, at home, I try to talk 
with a few of these friends about 
my feelings. But I discover that 
whatever female patterns they’ve 
borrowed are superficial ones; 
none of them bother to grow an 
extra lobe, but merely tuck the 
Terran pattern into a corner of 
their own for handy reference. 
They are most of them on sulfas. 
Hard and shiny toys, they skip 
like pebbles over the surface of 
the colonists’ lives. 

Then they go home, revert to 
their own free forms, and enjoy 
their mathematics, colors, com- 
positions, and seedings. 

“Why me?” I demand of the 
Warden. “Why two lobes? Why 
me?” 

“We felt you’d be more ef- 
ficient,” he answers. “And while 
you’re here, which you seldom 
are these days, you’d better re- 
vert to other shapes. Your par- 
ticles may be damaged if you 
hold that woman form too long.” 

/^h, but you don’t know, I 
want to tell him. You don’t 
know I’ll hold it forever. If I’m 
damaged or dead, you’ll put me 
into the cell banks, and you’ll be 
amazed, astonished, terrified, to 
discover that I come out com- 
plete, all Martha. I can’t be 
changed. 



“You little lump of protagon,” 
my Uncle mumbles bitterly. 
“You’ll never amount to any- 
thing, you’ll never be a Warden. 
Have you done any of your own 
work recently?” 

I say, “Yes, I’ve done some 
crystal divisions, and re-grown 
them in non-established pat- 
terns.” My Uncle is in a bad 
mood, as he’s kicking sulfa and 
his nerve tissue is addled. I’m 
wise to speak quietly to him, but 
he still grumbles. 

“I can’t understand why you 
like being a two-lobed pack of 
giggles. I couldn’t wait to get out 
of it. And you were so dead 
against it to begin with.” 

“Well, I have learned,” I start 
to say, but can’t explain what it 
is I’m still learning, and close 
my eyes. Part of it is that on 
the line between the darkness 
and the brightness it’s easiest to 
float. I’ve never wanted to prac- 
tise only easy things. My balance 
is damaged. I never had to bal- 
ance. It’s not a term or concept 
that I understand even now, at 
home, in free form. Some impress 
of Martha’s pattern lies on my 
own brain cells. I suspect it’s 
permanent damage, which gives 
me joy. That’s what I mean 
about not understanding it. I am 
taught to strive for perfection. 
How can I be pleased with this, 
which may be a catastrophe? 

Arnie carves on a breadth of 



160 



GALAXY 



kaku wood, bringing out to the 
surface a seascape. Knots be- 
come clots of spray, a flaw be- 
comes wind-blown spume. I want 
to be Martha. I’d like to go to 
the Laugh Tree with Arnie, for a 
good time, I’d like to learn to 
play cards with him. 

You see what happens’ Amie 
is, in his way, like my original 
self, and I hate that part of him, 
since I’ve given it up to be Mar- 
tha. Martha makes him happy, 
she is chocolate to his appetite, 
pillow for his weariness. 

I turn for company to my 
koota. She’s the color of morn- 
ing, her chest juts out like an 
axe blade, her ribs spring up and 
back like wings, her eyes are 
large and clear as she returns my 
gaze. Yet she’s beyond hope; in 
a little time, she’ll be lame; she 
cannot race any more, she must 
not mother a litter. I turn to her 
and she gazes back into my eyes, 
dreaming of speed and wind on 
the sandy beaches where she has 
run. 

“Why don’t you read some 
tapes?” Arnie suggests to me, be- 
cause I’m restless and I disturb 
him. The koota lies at my feet. 
I read tapes. Every evening in 
his quarters Arnie carves, I read 
tapes, the broken racer lies at 
my feet. I pass through Terran 
history this way. When the clown 
tumbles into the tub, I laugh. 
Terran history is full of clowns 



and tubs; at first it seems that’s 
all there is, but you learn to see 
beneath the comic costumes. 

While I float on the taut line, 
the horizon between light and 
dark, where it’s so easy, I begin 
to sense what is under the cos- 
tumes: staggering down the 

street dead drunk on a sunny af- 
ternoon with everyone laughing 
•at you; hiding under the veranda 
because you made blood come 
out of Pa’s face; kicking a man 
when he’s in the gutter because 
you’ve been kicked and have to 
pass it on. Tragedy is w'hat one 
of the Terrans called being a 
poet in the body of a cockroach. 

(tTTave you heard the rum- 
or?” Arnie asks, putting 
down the whittling tool. “Have 
you heard that some of the per- 
sonnel in Punch Center aren’t 
really humans?” 

“Not reaUy?” I ask, putting 
away the tape. We have no trag- 
edy. In my species, family rela- 
tionships are based only on re- 
lated gene patterns; they are 
finally dumped into the family 
bank and a new relative is creat- 
ed from the old. It’s one form of 
ancient history multiplying it- 
self, but it isn’t tragic. The koota, 
her utility destroyed by a reces- 
sive gone, lies sleeping at my 
foot. Is this tragedy? But she is 
a sitigh' form, she can’t regener- 
nlo (I lost limb, or exfoliate brain 



WHEN 1 WAS MISS DOW 



161 



tissue. She can only return my 
gaze with her steadfast and affec- 
tionate one. 

“What are they, then?” I ask 
Amie. “If they’re not human?” 

“The story is that the local life 
forms aren’t as we really see 
them. They’ve put on faces, like 
ours, to deal with us. And some 
of them have filtered into per- 
sonnel.” 

Filtered! As if I were a virus. 

• “But they must be harmless,” 
I say. “No harm has come to 
anyone.” 

“We don’t know that for a 
fact,” Amie replies. 

“You look tired,” I say, and 
he comes to me, to be soothed, 
to be loved in his flesh, his single 
form, his search for the truth in 
the darkness of the viewing cub- 
icle. At present he’s doing stud- 
ies of murger birds. Their spinal 
cavities are large, air-filled ovals, 
and their bone is extremely por- 
ous, which permits them to soar 
to great heights. 

The koota no longer races on 
the wind-blown beaches; she lies 
at our feet, looking into the dis- 
tance. The wall must be trans- 
parent to her eyes, I feel that be- 
yond it she sees clearly how the 
racers go, down the long, bright 
curve of sand in the morning 
sun. She sighs, and lays her head 
down on her narrow, delicate 
paws. I look into the distance 
too: bright beaches and Amie, 



carrying me from his ship. But 
he will not carry me again. 

Arnie says. “I seem to be tired 
all the time.” He puts his head 
on my breast. “I don’t think the 
food’s agreeing with me, lately.” 

“Do you suffer pains?” I ask 
him, curiously. 

“Suffer,” he mutters. “What 
kind of nonsense is that, with 
' analgesics. No I don’t suffer. I 
just don’t feel well.” 

He’s absorbed in murger birds, 
kaku wood, he descends into 
the bottom of the darks and 
rises up like a rocket across the 
horizon into the thin clarity 
above, while I float. I no longer 
dare to breathe I’m afraid of dis- 
turbing everything. I do not want 
anything. His head lies gently on 
my breast and I will not disturb 
him. 

“Oh. My God,” Amie says, 
and I know what it’s come to, 
even before he begins to choke, 
and his muscles leap although I 
hold him in my arms. I know his 
heart is choking on massive doses 
of blood; the brilliance fades 
from his eyes and they begin to 
go dark while I tightly hold him. 
If he doesn’t see me as he dies, 
will I be here? 

I can feel, under my fingers, 
how rapidly his skin cools. I 
must put him down, here with 
his carvings and his papers, and 
I must go home. But I lift Arnie 



162 



GALAXY 



in my arms, and call the koota, 
who gets up rather stiffly. It’s 
long after dark, and I carry him 
slowly, carefully, home to what 
he called a crystal palace, where 
the Warden and my Uncle are 
teaching each other to play chess 
with a set some space captain 
gave them in exchange for seed 
crystals. They sit in a bloom of 
light, sparkling, their old brains 
bent over the chessmen, as I 
breathe open the door and carry 
Amie in. 

First, my Uncle gives me just 
a glance, but then another glance, 
and a hard stare. “Is that the 
Doctor?” he asks. 

I put Amie down and hold one 
of his cold hands. “Warden,” I 
say, on my knees, on eye level 
with the chessboard and its 
carved men. “Warden, can you 
put him in one of the banks?” 

The Warden turns to look at 
me, as hard as my Uncle. 
“You’ve become deranged, try- 
ing to maintain two lobes,” he 
says. “You cannot reconstitute 
or recreate a Terran by our 
methods, and you must know it.” 

“Over the edge, over the 
edge,” my Uncle says, nov/ a 
blond, six-foot, hearty male Ter- 
ran, often at the Laugh Tree with 
one of the joy babies. He enjoys 
life, his own or someone else’s. 
I have, too, I suppo.se. Am I fad- 
ing? I am, really, just one of Ar- 
nie’s projections, a form on a 



screen in his mind. I am not, 
really, Martha. Though I tried. 

“We can’t have him here,” the 
Warden says. “You better get 
him out of here. You couldn’t 
explain a corpse like that to the 
colonists, if they come looking 
for him. They’ll think we did 
something to him. It’s nearly 
time for my next conjunction, do 
you want your nephew to arrive 
in disgrace? The Uncles will 
drain his bank.” 

The Warden gets up and comes 
over to me. He takes hold of my 
dark curls and pulls me to my 
feet. It hurts my physical me, 
which is Martha. God knows 
Amie, I’m Martha, it seems to 
me. “Take him back to his quar- 
ters,” the Warden says to me. 
“And come back here immed- 
iately. I’ll try to see you back to 
your own pattern, but it may be 
too late. In part, I blame myself. 
If you must know. So I will try.” 
Yes, yes, I want to say to him; 
as I was, dedicated, free; turn me 
back into myself, I never wanted 
to be anyone else, and now I 
don’t know if I am anyone at 
all. The light’s gone from his 
eyes and he doesn’t see me, or 
see anything, does he? 

I pick him up and breathe the 
door out, and go back through 
the night to his quarters, where 
the lamp still burns. I’m going 
to leave him here, where he be- 



WHEN I WAS MISS DOW 



163 



longs. Before I go, I pick up the 
small carving of the murger bird, 
and take it with me, home to my 
glass bridge where at the edge 
of the mirrors the decimals are 
still clicking perfectly, clicking 
out known facts; an octagon can 
be reduced, the planet turns at 
such a degree on its axis, to see 
the truth you must have light of 
some sort, but to see the light 
you must have darkness of some 
sort. I can no longer float on the 
horizon between the two because 
that horizon has disappeared. 
I’ve learned to descend, and to 
rise, and descend again. 



I’m able to revert without help 
to my own free form, to re-ab- 
sorb the extra brain tissue. The 
sun comes up and it’s bright. The 
night comes down and it’s dark. 
I’m becoming somber, and a bril- 
liant student. Even my Uncle 
says I’ll be a good Warden when 
the time comes. 

The Warden goes to conjimc- 
tion; from the cell banks a 
nephew is lifted out. The koota 
lies dreaming of races she has 
run in the wind. It is our life, 
and it goes on, like the life of 
other creatures.

GALAXY 



Open The Shy 

by ROBERT SILVERBERG 



Illustrated by MORROW 



His disciples ruled three 
worlds. Then he gave them 
away — to win a universe! 



I 

''T^he surgical amphitheater was 
a chilly horseshoe lit by a 
pale violet glow. At tire north 
end, windows on the level of the 
second gallery admitted frosty 
New Mexico sunlight. 

From where he sat, overlook- 
ing the operating table, Noel 
Vorst could see the bluish moun- 
tains in the middle distance be- 
yond the confines of the research 
center. The mountains did not in- 
terest him. Neither did what was 



taking place on the operating 
table. But he kept his lack of in- 
terest to himself. 

Vorst had not needed to at- 
tend the operation in person, of 
course. He knew already that a 
successful outcome was improb- 
able. So did everyone else. But 
the Founder was 144 years old, 
and thought it useful to appear 
in public as often as his strength 
could sustain the effort. It did 
not do to have people think he 
had lapsed into senility. 

Down below, the surgeons were 



165 



clustered about a bare brain. 
Vorst had watched them lift the 
dome of a skull and thrust their 
scalpels of light deep into the 
wrinkled gray mass. There were 
ten billion neurons in that block 
of tissue, and an infinity of axonal 
terminals and dendritic receptors. 
The surgeons hoped to rearrange 
the synaptic nets of that brain, 
altering the protein-molecular 
switchgear to render the patient 
more useful to Vorst’s plan. 

Folly, the old man thought. He 
kept his pessimism to himself 
and sat quietly, listening to the 
pulsing of the blood in his own 
glossy artificial arteries. 

What they were doing down 
there was remarkable, of course. 
Summoning all the resources of 
modern microsurgery, the lead- 
ing men of the Noel Vorst Cen- 
ter for the Biological Sciences 
were altering the protein-protein 
molecular recognition patterns 
within a human brain. Twist the 
circuits about a bit; change the 
transsynaptic structures to build 
a better link between pre- and 
postsynaptic membranes; shunt 
individual synaptic inputs from 
one dendritic tree to another; in 
short, reprogram the brain to 
make it capable of doing what- 
ever Noel Vorst wanted. 

Which was to serve as the pro- 
pulsive force needed to hurl a 
team of explorers across the gulf 
of light-years to another star. 



I t was an extraordinary project. 

For some fifty years the sur- 
geons here at Vorst’s Santa Fe 
research center had prepared for 
it by meddling with the brains of 
cats and monkeys and dolphins. 
Now they had at last begun oper- 
ating on human subjects. The 
patient on the table was a mid- 
dle-grade esper, a precog with 
poor timebinding ability; his life 
expectancy was on the order of 
six months, and then a burnout 
could be anticipated. The precog 
knew all about that, which was 
why he had volunteered to be 
the subject. The most skilful sur- 
geons in the world were at work 
on him. 

There were only two things 
wrong with the project, Vorst 
knew; 

It was not likely to succeed. 
And it was not at all necessary 
in the first place. 

You do not tell a group of 
dedicated men, however, that 
their life’s work is pointless. Be- 
sides, there was always the faint 
hope that they might artificially 
create a pusher — a telekinetic 
— down there. So Vorst dutifully 
attended the operation. The men 
on the amphitheater floor knew 
that the • Founder’s numinous 
presence was with them. Though 
they did not look up toward the 
gallery where Vorst sat, they 
knew the withered but still vigo- 
rous old man was smiling benign- 



166 



GALAXY 



ly down on them, cushioned 
against the pull of Earth by the 
webfoam cradle that sheltered 
his ancient limbs. 

The lenses of his eyes were 
synthetic. The coils of his intes- 
tines had been fashioned from 
laboratory polymers. The stoutly 
pumping heart came from an or- 
gan bank. Little remained of the 
original Noel Vorst but the brain 
itself, which was intact though 
awash with the anticoagulants 
that preserved it from disabling 
strokes. 

“Are you comfortable, sir?” the 
pale young acolyte at his side 
asked. 

“Perfectly. Are you?” Vorst 
answered in a bantering tone. 

The acolyte smiled at Vorst’s 
little joke. He was only twenty 
years old, and full of pride be- 
cause it was his turn to accom- 
pany the Founder on his daily 
round. 

Vorst liked young people 
.-'bout him. They were tremen- 
dously in awe of him, naturally, 
hut they managed to be warm 
and respectful without canoniz- 
ing him. Within his body there 
throbbed the contributions of 
many a young Vorster volunteer: 
a film of lung tissue from one, a 
retina from another, kidnejrs 
from a pair of twins. He was a 
patchwork man, and he carried 
the flesh of his movement about 
with him. 



''T^he surgeons were bending low 
■^tover the exposed brain down 
there. Vorst could not see what 
they were doing. A pickup em- 
bedded in a surgical instrument 
relayed the scene to a lambent 
screen on the level of the viewing 
gallery, but even the enlarged 
image did not tell Vorst much. 
Baffled and bored, he retained 
his look of lively interest all the 
same. 

Quietly he pushed a communi- 
cator stud on his armrest and 
said, “Is Coordinator Kirby go- 
ing to get here soon?” 

“He’s talking to Venus, sir.” 
“Who’s he speaking to? Laz- 
arus or Mondschein?” 

“Mondschein, sir. I’ll teU him 
to come to you as sOon as he’s 
off.” 

Vorst smiled. Protocol suggest- 
ed that such high-level negotia- 
tions be carried on at the admin- 
istrative level, between the execu- 
tives and not between the proph- 
ets. So the second-in-commands 
were speaking: Flemispheric Co- 
ordinator Reynolds Kirby on be- 
half of the Vorsters of Earth, and 
Christopher Mondschein for the 
Harmonists who ran Venus. But 
in time it would be necessary to 
close the deal with a conference 
between those most closely in 
tune with the Eternal Oneness, 
and that would be the task of 
Vorst and Lazarus. 

... to close the deal . 



OPEN THE SKY 



167 



II 



A tremor pulled Vorst’s right 
hand into a sudden claw. The 
acolyte swung around attentive- 
ly, ready to jab buttons until he 
had restored the Founder’s me- 
tabolic equilibrium. Grimly Vorst 
compelled the hand to relax. 

“I’m all right,” he insisted. 

... to open the sky . 

They were so close to the end, 
now, that it had ajl begun to 
seem like a dream. A century of 
scheming, playing chess with un- 
born antagonists, rearing a fan- 
tastic edifice of theocracy on a 
single slender, arrogant hope — 

Was it madness, Vorst wonder- 
ed, to wish to reshape the pattern 
of history? 

Was it monstrous, he asked 
himself, to succeed? 

On the operating table, the pa- 
tient’s leg came swimming up 
out of a sea of swathing and kick- 
ed fitfully and convulsively at 
the air. The anesthetist’s fingers 
played over his console, and the 
esper w/ho was standing by for 
such an emergency went into si- 
lent action. There was a flurry 
of activity about the table. 

In that moment, a tall, fragile- 
looking old man entered the- gal- 
lery and presented himself to 
Vorst. 

“How’s the operation going?” 
Reynolds Kirby asked. 

“The patient just died,” said 
Vorst. “Things seemed to be go- 
ing so well, too.” 



I^irby had not expected much 
of the operation. He had dis- 
cussed it fully with Vorst the day 
before; though he was no scien- 
tist himself, the Coordinator tried 
to keep abreast of the work be- 
ing done at the research center. 

His own sphere of responsibil- 
ity was administrative; it was 
Kirby’s job to oversee the far- 
flung secular activities of a re- 
ligious cult that virtually ruled 
the planet. The Brotherhood of 
the Immanent Radiance, spring- 
ing from a humble start, had cap- 
tured the imaginations of Earth’s 
billions with its promise of phy- 
sical immortality and its dream 
of reaching the stars. It was al- 
most ninety years since Kirby 
himself had been converted, and 
he had watched the cult grow 
mighty. 

Political power, though it was 
useful to wield, was not supposed 
to be the Brotherhood’s goal. The 
essence of the movement was its 
scientific program, centering on 
the facilities at Santa Fe. Here, 
over the decades, an unsurpass- 
able factory of miracles had been 
constructed, lubricated by the 
cash contributions of billions of 
tithing Vorsters on every conti- 
nent. And the miracles had been 
forthcoming. The regeneration 
processes now insured a predict- 
able lifespan of three or four cen- 



168 



GALAXY 



turies for the newborn; perehaps 
more, for no one could be certain 
that immortality had been achiev- 
ed until a few millennia of test- 
ing had elapsed. The Brother- 
hood could offer a reasonable 
facsimile of life eternal, at any 
rate, and that was a sufficient 
redemption of the promissory 
note on which the whole move- 
ment had been founded a hun- 
dred years before. 

The other goal, though — the 
stars — had given the Brother- 
hood a harder pursuit. 

TV yTan was locked into his solar 
system by the limiting ve- 
locity of light. Chemical-fueled 
rockets and even ion-drive ships 
simply took too long to get about. 
Mars and Venus were within easy 
reach, but the cheerless outer 
planets were not, and the round 
trip to the nearest star would take 
a few decades by current tech- 
nology, nine years even at the 
very best. 

So man had transformed Mars 
into a habitable world, and he 
had transformed himself into 
something capable of inhabiting 
Venus. He mined the moons of 
Jupiter and Saturn, paid occa- 
sional visits to Plutcj, and sent 
robots down to examine Mercury 
and the gas giants. And looked 
hopelessly to the stars. 

The laws of relativity governed 
the motions of real bodies through 



real space, but they did not ne- 
cessarily apply to the events of 
the paranormal world. To Noel 
Vorst, it had seemed that the 
only route to the stars was the 
extra-sensory one. So he had 
gathered espers of all varieties at 
Santa Fe, and for generations 
now had carried on breeding pro- 
grams and genetic manipulations. 
The Brotherhood had spawned 
an interesting variety of espers, 
but none with the talent of trans- 
porting physical bodies through 
space. While on Venus the tele- 
kinetic mutation had happened 
spontaneously, an ironic bypro- 
duct of the adaptation of human 
life to that world. 

Venus was beyond direct Vor- 
ster control. It, too, had come 
under a theocracy, but its rulers 
were the Harmonists, a Vorster 
heresy founded 75 years before 
by one David Lazarus. Lazarus 
had been quickly martyred, or so 
it had been thought until a dozen 
years ago, when his living but 
suspended body turned up in a 
crypt on Mars. Technicians at 
Santa Fe had revived him, and 
he now was on Venus, directing 
the cult that had flourished so 
well there during his years of 
slumber. The Harmonists of Ve- 
nus had the pushers that Vorst 
needed to reach into the galaxy. 
They showed little interest, 
though, in collaborating with the 
Vorsters on an expedition. For

weeks, now, Reynolds Kirby had 
been negotiating with his oppo- 
site number on Venus, attempt- 
ing to bring about an agreement. 

Meanwhile the surgeons at 
Santa Fe had never given up 
their dream of creating pushers 
out of Earthmen, thus making the 
cooperation of the unpredictable 
Venusians unnecessary. The sy- 
naptic - rearrangement project, 
flov/ering at last, had come to the 
stage where a human subject 
would go under the beam. 

6«Tt wont work,” Vorst had 
-^.said to Kirby. “They’re still 
fift'/ years av/ay from anything.” 
“T don’t understand it, Noel. 
The Venusians have the gene for 



telekinesis, don’t they? Why 
can’t we just duplicate it? Con- 
sidering all we’ve done with the 
nucleic acids — ” 

Vorst smiled. “There’s no ‘gene 
for telekinesis’ as such, you know. 
It’s part of a constellation of 
genetic patterns. We’ve been ry- 
ing consciously to duplicate it 
for thirty years, and we aren’t 
even close. We’ve also been try- 
ing a random approach, since 
that’s how the Venusians got the 
ability. No luck there either. And 
then there’s this synapse busi- 
ness: alter the brain itself, not 
the genes. That may get us some- 
where, eventually. But I can’t 
wait another fifty years.” 
“You’ll live that long, surely.”

GALAXY 




“Yes,” Vorst agreed, “but I 
still can’t wait any longer. The 
Venusians have the men we need. 
It’s time to win them over.” 

Patiently Kirby had wooed 
the heretics. There were signs of 
progress in the negotiations, now. 
In view of the failure of the 
operation, the need for an agree- 
ment with Venus was more ur- 
gent. 

“Come with me,” Vorst said, 
as the dead patient was wheeled 
away. “They’re testing that gar- 
goyle today, and I want to 
watch.” 

Kirby followed the Founder 
out of the amphitheater. Aco- 
lytes were close by in case of 
trouble. Vorst, these days, rare- 



ly tried to walk any more, and 
rolled along in his cradling net 
of webfoam. Kirby still pre- 
ferred to use his feet, though 
he was nearly as ancient as Vorst. 
The sight of the two of them 
promenading through the plazas 
of the research center always 
stirred attention. 

“You aren’t disturbed over the 
failure just now?” Kirby asked. 

“Why should I be? I told you 
it was too soon for success.” 

“What about this gargoyle? 
Any hope?” 

“Our hope,” Vorst said quietly, 
“is Venus. They already have 
the pushers.” 

“Then why keep trying to de- 
velop them here?” 



OPEN THE SKY

“Momentum. The Brother- 
hood hasn’t slowed down in a 
hundred years. I’m not closing 
any avenue now. Not even the 
hopeless ones. It’s all a matter 
of momentum.” 

Kirby shrugged. For all the 
power he held in the organiza- 
tion — and his powers were im- 
mense — he had never felt that 
he held any real initiative. The 
plans of the movement were gen- 
erated, as they had been from the 
first, by Noel Vorst. He and only 
he knew what game he was play- 
ing. And if Vorst died this after- 
noon, with the game unfinished? 
What would happen to the move- 
ment then? Run on its own mo- 
mentum? To what end, Kirby 
wondered? 

'■^hey entered a squat, glitter- 
ing little building of irra- 
diated green foamglass. An awed 
hush preceded them: Vorst was 
coming! Men in blue robes came 
out to greet the Founder. They 
led him to the room in the rear 
where the gargoyle v/as kept. 
Kirby kept pace, ignoring the 
acolytes who were rea'dy to catch 
him if he stumbled. 

The gargoyle was sitting en- 
meshed in lacy restraining rib- 
bons. He was not a pretty sight. 
Thirteen years old, three feet tall, 
grotesquely deformed, deaf, crip- 
pled, his corneas clouded, his 
skin pebbled and granulated. A 



mutant, though not one pro- 
duced by any laboratory; this 
was Hurler’s Syndrome, a natural 
and congenital error of meta- 
bolism, first indentified scien- 
tifically two and a half centuries 
before. The unlucky parents had 
brought the hapless monster to 
a chapel of the Brotherhood in 
Stockholm, hoping that by bath- 
ing him in the Blue Fire of the 
cobalt reactor his defects would 
be cured. The defects had not 
been cured, but an esper at die 
chapel had detected latent tal- 
ents in the gargoyle, and so he 
was here to be probed and test- 
ed. Kirby felt a shiver of revul- 
sion. 

“What causes such a thing?” 
he asked the medic at his el- 
bow. 

“Abnormal genes. They pro- 
duce metabolic error that results 
in an accumulation of mucopoly- 
saccharides in the tissues of the 
body.” 

Kirby nodded solemnly. “And 
is there supposed to be a direct 
link with esping?” 

“Only coincidental,” said the 
medic. 

Vorst had moved up to study 
the creature at close range. The 
Founder’s eye-shutters clicked 
upward as he peered forward. 
The gargoyle was humped and 
folded, virtually unable to move 
its limbs. The milky eyes held a 
look of pure misery. To the euth- 



172

anasia heap with this one, Kirby 
thought. But yet Vorst hoped 
that such a monster would take 
him to the stars! 

“Begin the examination,” Vorst 
murmured. 

\ pair of espers came forward, 
general-purpose types; a 
slick young woman with frizzy 
hair, and a plump, sad-faced 
man. Kirby, whose owfn esping 
facilities were deficient to the 
point of nonexistence, watched in 
silence as the wordless examin- 
ation commenced. What were 
they doing? What shafts were 
they aiming at the huddled crea- 
ture before them? Kirby did not 
know, and he took comfort in 
the fact that Vorst probably did 
not know either. The Founder 
wa.sn’t much of an esper him- 
self. 

Ten minutes passed. Then the 
girl looked up and said, “Low- 
order pyrotic, mainly.” 

“He can push molecules 
about?” Vorst said. “Then he’s 
got a shred of telekinesis.” 

“Only a shred,” the second 
esper said. “Nothing that others 
don’t have. Also low-order com- 
munication abilities. He seems to 
be sitting there telling us to kill 
him.” 

“If it were up to me, I’d 
recommend dissection,” said the 
girl. “The subject certainly 
wouldn’t mind.” 



Kirby shuddered. These two 
bland espers had peered within 
the mind of that crippled thing, 
and that in itself ^ould have 
been enough to dirivd their souls. 
To see, for an empathic mom- 
ent, what it was like to be a 
thirteen-year-old human gar- 
goyle, to look out upon the 
world through those clouded 
eyes — I But they were all busi- 
ness, these two. They had merg- 
ed minds with monstrosities be- 
fore. 

Vorst waved his hand. “Keep 
him for further study. Maybe 
he can be guided toward useful- 
ness. If he’s really a pyrotic, take 
the usual precautions.” 

The Founder whirled his chair 
around and started to leave the 
ward. At that same moment an 
acolyte came hurrying in, bear- 
ing a message. He froze at the 
unexpected sight of Vorst wheel- 
ing toward a collision with him. 
Vorst smiled paternally and 
guided himself around the boy, 
who went limp with relief. 

The acolyte said, “Message for 
you. Coordinator Kirby.” 

Kirby took it and jammed his 
thumb against the seal. The en- 
velope popped open, seemingly 
of its own volition. 

The message was from Monds- 
chein . 

“LAZARUS IS READY TO 
TALK TO VORST,” it said 
ominously.

"T rorst said, “I was insane, you 
' know. For sometliing like 
ten years. Later I discovered 
what the trouble was. I was suf- 
fering from time-float?” 

The pallid esper girl’s eyes 
were very round as she gazed 
at him. They were alone in the 
Founder’s personal quarters. She 
was thin, loosedimbed, thirty 
years old. Strands of black hair 
dangled like painted straw down 
the sides of her face. Her name 
was Delphine, and in all the 
months that she had served 
Verst’s needs she had never be- 
come accustomed to his frank- 
ness. She had little chance to; 
when she left his office after 
each session, other espers erased 
her recollection of the visit. 

She said, “Shall I turn myself 
on?” 

“Not yet, Delphine. Do you 
ever think of yourself as insane? 
In the difficult moments, the 
moments when you start ranging 
along the time-line and don’t 
think you’ll ever get back to 
now?” 

“It’s pretty scary sometimes.” 

“But you get back. That’s the 
miraculous thing. You know how 
many floaters I’ve seen bum 
out?” Vorst asked. “Hundreds. 
I’d have burned out myself, ex- 
cept that I’m a lousy precog. 
Back then, though, I kept break- 



ing loose, drifting along the time- 
line. I saw the whole Brother- 
hood spread out before me. Call 
it a vision, call it a dream. I 
saw it, Delphine. Blurred around 
the edges.” 

“Just as you told it in your 
book?” 

“More or less,” said the Foun- 
der. “The years between 2055 
and 2063 — those were the years 
I had the visions worst. When I 
was 35, it started. I was just an 
ordinary technician, a nobody, 
and then I got what could be 
called divine inspiration, ex- 
cept all it was was a peek at my 
own future. I thought I was go- 
ing crazy. Later I understood.” 

The esper was silent. Vorst 
shuttered his eyes. The memor- 
ies glowed in him: after years 
of internal chaos and collapse, 
he had come from the crucible 
of madness purified, aware of his 
purpose. He saw how he could 
reshape the world. More than 
that: he saw how he had re- 
shaped the world. After that, it 
was just a matter of making the 
beginning, of founding the first 
chapels, dreaming up the rituals 
of the cult, surrounding himself 
with the scientific talent neces- 
sary to realize his goals. Was 
there a touch of paranoia in his 
purpose, a bit of Hitler, a tinge 
of Napoleon, a tincture of Gen- 
gis Kahn? Perhaps. Vorst 
complacently viewed himself as 



174 



GALAXY 



a fanatic and even as a megalo- 
maniac. But a cool, rational 
megalomaniac, and a successful 
one. He had been willing to stop 
at nothing to gain his ends, and 
he was just enough of a precog 
to know that he was going to 
gain them. 

TTe said, “It’s a big responsi- 
bility, setting out to trans- 
form the world. A man has to be 
a little daft to attempt it or even 
to think he can attempt it. But 
it helps to know what the out- 
come must be. One doesn’t feel 
so idiotic, knowing that he’s 
simply acting out the inevitable."’ 

“It takes the challenge out of 
life,’’ said the esper. 

“Ah, Delphine, you touch the 
gaping wound! But you’d know, 
of course. How dreary it is to be 
playing out your ov/n script, 
aware of what’s ahead. At least 
I’ve had the m»ercy of uncertain- 
ty in the small things. I can’t 
see very much myself, so I have 
to hitchhike with floaters like 
you, and the visions aren’t clear. 
But you see clearly, don’t you, 
Delphine? You’ve been along 
your own world-line. Have you 
seen your own burnout yet, Del- 
phine?’’ 

The esper’s cheeks colored. She 
looked at the floor silently. 

“I’m sorry, Delphine,” Vorst 
said. “I had not right to ask 
tliat. I retract it. Turn on for me. 



Delphine. Do your trick. Take 
me along. I’ve said too much 
today.” 

Shyly, the girl composed her- 
self for her great effort. She had 
more control than most of her 
kind, Vorst knew. Whereas most 
of the precogs eventually slipped 
their moorings, Delphine had 
clung to her powers and her life 
and had reached what was, for 
her kind of esper, a ripe old 
age. She would burn out, too, 
one day, when she overreached 
herself. But up to now she had 
been invaluable to Vorst, his 
crystal ball, the most helpful of 
all the floaters who had aided 
him in plotting his course. And 
if she could hold out just a 
while longer, until he saw his 
route past the final obstacles, the 
long journey would end and they 
both could rest. 

She released her grip on the 
present and moved into that 
realm where all moments are 
nov/. 

Vorst watched, and waited, 
and felt the girl taking him along 
as she began her time-shuttling. 
He could not initiate the journey 
himself, but he could follov/. 
Mists enfolded him, and he 
swung dizzily along the line of 
time, as he had done so often 
before. He saw himself, here and 
here, and saw others, shadow- 
figures, dream-figures, lurking 
behind the curtains of time.

1 azarus? Yes, Lazarus was 

^ there. Kirby, too. Monds- 
chein. All of them, the pawns 
in the game. Vorst saw the glow 
of otherness and looked out upon 
a landscape that v/as neither 
Earth nor Mars nor Venus. He 
trembled. He looked up at a tree 
eight hundred feet high, with 
a corona of azure leaves against 
a foggy sky. Then he was ripped 
away, and hurled into the stink- 
ing confusion of a rain-spattered 
city street, and stood before one 
of his early chapels. The build- 
ing was on fire in the rain, and 
the smell of scorched wet wood 
assailed his nostrils. And then, 
smiling into the stunned parched 
face of Reynolds Kirby. And 
then — 

The sense of motion left him. 
He slipped back into his own 
matrix of time, making the 
adrenal adjustments that com- 
pensated for his exertions. The 
floater lay slumped in her chair, 
sweat-flecked, dazed. Vorst sum- 
moned an acolyte. 

“Take her to her ward,” he 
said. “Have them work on her 
until she comes back to her 
strength.” 

The acolyte nodded and lifted 
the girl. Vorst sat motionless un- 
til they were gone. He was sat- 
isfied with the session. It had 
confirmed his own intuitive ideas 
of his immediate direction, and 
that was always comforting. 



“Send me Capodimonte,” Vorst 
said into the communicator. 

''T^he chubby blue-robed figure 
entered a few minutes later. 
When Vorst was in Santa Fe, 
one did not waste time in get- 
ting to his quarters after a sum- 
mons. Capodimonte was the Dis- 
trict Supervisor for the Santa 
Fe region, and was customarily 
in charge here except when such 
figures as Vorst or ' Kirby were 
in residence. Capodimonte was 
stolid, loyal, useful. Vorst trust- 
ed him for delicate assignments. 
They exchanged quick, casual 
benedictions now. 

Then Vorst said, “Capo, how 
long would it take you to pick 
the personnel for an interstellar 
expedition?” 

“Inter — ” 

“Say, for departure later this 
year. Run the specs off at Arch- 
ives and get together a few possi- 
ble teams.” 

Capodimonte had recovered 
his aplomb. “What size teams?” 

“All sizes. From two persons 
to about a dozen. Start with an 
Adam-and-Eve pair, and work 
up to, say, six couples. Matched 
for health, adaptability, compati- 
bility, skills and fertility.” 

“Espers?” 

“With caution. You can throw 
in a couple of empaths, a cou- 
ple of healers. Stay away from 
the exotics, though. And remem-

ber that these people are sup- 
posed to be pioneers. They’ve 
got to be flexible. We can do 
without geniuses on this trip, 
Capo.” 

“You want me to report to 
you or to Kirby when I’ve made 
the lists?” 

“To me, Capo. I don’t want 
you to utter a syllable about this 
to Kirby or anyone else. Just 
get in there and run off the 
groups as we’ve already pro- 
grammed them. I’m not sure 
what size expedition we’ll be 
sending, and I want to have a 
group ready that’ll be self-suf- 
ficient at any level, two, four, 
eight, whatever it turns out to 
be. Take two or three days. 
When you’ve done that, put half 
a dozen of your best men to 
work on the logistics of the trip. 
Assume an esper-powered cap- 
sule and go over the optimum 
designs. 

We’ve had decades to plan it; 
we must have a whole arsenal 
of blueprints. Look them over. 
This is your baby. Capo.” 

“Sir? One subversive question, 
please?” 

“Ask it.” 

“Is this a hypothetical exer- 
cise I’m doing, or is this the real 
thing?” 

“I don’t wnow,” said Vorst 
honestly. 

The man nodded, turned and 
left the room. 



nphe blue face of a Venusian 
looked out of the screen, 
alien and forbidding; but its 
owner had been bom an Earth- 
man, and the terrestrial heritage 
betrayed itself in the shape of 
the skull, the set of the lips, 
the thrust of the chin. The face 
was that of David Lazarus, foun- 
der and resurrected head of the 
cult of Transcendent Harmony. 
Though he was the arch-heresi- 
arch, Lazarus owed his resurrec- 
tion to the skill of his cult’s riv- 
als, the Vorsters. He owed his 
Venusian features to Vorster skill, 
too. Twelve years ago, after his 
dramatic return to life, the mir- 
acle-men of Sante Fe had equip- 
ped Lazarus to breathe the 
poisonous air of the planet where 
his followers now made their 
headquarters. 

Vorst had conferred often with 
Lazarus in those twelve years. 
And always the two prophets had 
allowed themselves the luxury of 
full visual contact. It was monu- 
mentally expensive to bounce 
not only voices but images dov/n 
the chain of relay stations that 
led from Venus to Earth, but ex- 
pense meant little to these men. 
Vorst insisted. He liked to see 
Lazarus’ transformed face as they 
spoke. It gave him something 
to focus on during the long dull- 
time lags in their conversations. 



OPEN THE SKY

Even at the speed of light, it 
takes a while for a message to 
get from planet to planet. Even 
a simple exchange of views took 
more than an hour. 

Comfortable in his nest of web- 
foam, Vorst said, “I think it’s 
time to unite our movement, 
David. We complement one an- 
other. There’s nothing to gain 
from further division.” 

“There might be something to 
.lose by union,” said Lazarus. 
“We’re the younger branch. If 
your reabsorbed us, we’d be 
sv/allowed up in your hierachy.” 
“Not so. I guarantee you that 
your Harmonists will remain ful- 
ly autonomous. More than that: 
I’ll guarantee you a dominant 
role in policy setting.” 

“What kind of guarantee can 
you offer?” 

“Let that pass a moment,” 
Vorst said. “I’ve got an inter- 
stellar team ready to go. They’ll 
be fully equipped in a matter of 
months. I mean fully equipped. 
They’ll be able to cope with any- 
thing they meet. But they have 
to have a way of getting out of 
the solar system. Give us a push, 
David. You’ve got the person- 
nel, now. We’ve monitored your 
experiments.” 

T azarus nodded, his gill-bunch- 
es quivering. “I won’t deny 
what we’ve done. We can push 
a thousand tons from here to 



Pluto. We can keep the same 
mass going right to infinity?” 
“How long to get to Pluto?” 
“Fast. I won’t tell you exactly 
how fast. But let’s just say the 
stars are in reach. Have been 
for the last eight or ten months. 
We could get a ship there in — 
oh, let’s call it a year. Of course, 
we’d have no way of maintaining 
contact. We can push, but we 
can’t talk across a dozen light- 
years. Can you?” 

“No,” said Vorst. “The expedi- 
tion would be out of contact 
the moment it got past radio 
range. It would have to send 
back a conventional relay ship 
to announce its safe arrival. We 
wouldn’t know for decades. But 
we have to try. Give us your 
men, David.” 

“You realize it would burn out 
dozens of our mc«t promising 
youngsters?” 

“I realize. Give us your men 
an5rway. ■ We understand tech- 
niques for repairing burnouts. 
Let them push the ship to the 
stars, and when they drop in 
their tracks we’ll try to fix them 
up again. That’s what Santa Fe 
is for.” 

“First drive them to exhaus- 
tion, then patch them together?” 
Lazarus asked. “That’s ruthless. 
Are the stars that important? I’d 
rather see these boys develop 
their powers here on Venus and 
remain intact.”

“We need them.” 

“So do we.” 

Vorst made use of the interval 
to flood his body with stimulants. 
He was tingling, palpitating with 
vigor by the time his reply was 
due. He said, “David, I own 
you. I made you and I want you. 
I put you to sleep in 2090 when 
you were nothing, an upstart, and 
I brought you back to life in 
2152 and gave you a world. You 
owe me everything. Now I’m 
calling that obligation. I’ve been 
waiting a hundred years to reach 
this position. You people finally 
have the espers who can send my 
people to the stars. Whatever the 
personal cost at your end, I want 
you to send them.” 

The strain of that speech left 
Vorst dizzy with fatigue. But he 
had time to recover. Time to 
think, to v/ait for the reply. He 
had made his gamble, and now 
it was up to Lazarus. Vorst did 
not have many cards left to 
play. 

'"T^he blue-faced figure in the 
screen was motionless; 
Vorst’s words had not even 
reached Venus yet. Lazarus’ re- 
ply was a long time in coming. 

He said, “I didn’t think you’d 
be so blunt, Vorst. Why should 
I be grateful to you for re- 
viving me, when you jammed me 
in that hole in the first place? 
Oh, I know. Because my move- 




OPEN THE SKY 



ment was insignificant When you 
took me away from it, and a 
major force when you brought 
me back. Do you take credit 
for that too?” A pause. “Never 
mind. I don’t want to give you 
my espers. Breed your own, if 
you want to get to the stars.” 

“You’re talking foolishness. 
You want the stars too, David. 
But you don’t have the technical 
facilities, up there in the back 
woods, to equip an expedition. I 
do. Let’s join forces. It’s what 
you yourself want to do, no mat- 
ter how tough you talk now. Let 
me tell you what’s holding you 
back from agreeing to join me, 
David. You’re afraid of what 
your own people will do to you 
when they find out you’ve agreed 
to cooperate. They’ll say you’ve 
sold out to the Vorsters. You’re 
frozen in a position you don’t 
believe, just because you don’t 
have real independence. Assert 
yourself, David. Use your pow- 
ers. I put that planet into your 
hands. Now I v/ant you to re- 
pay me.” 

“How can I go to Mondschein 
and Martell and the others and 
tell them that I’ve meekly 
agreed to submit to you?” Laz- 
arus asked. “They’re restless 
enough at having had a resur- 
rected martyr slapped down on 
top of them. There are times 
when I expect them to martyr 
me again, and this time for 



good. I need a bargaining point.” 
Vorst smiled. Victory was in 
his grasp now. 

He said, “Tell them, David, 
that I offer you supreme authori- 
ty over both worlds. Tell them 
that the Brotherhood not only 
will welcome the Harmonists 
back, but that you’ll be made the 
sole head of both branches of 
the faith.” 

“Both?” 

“Both.” 

“And what becomes of you?” 
Vorst told him. And once the 
words were past his lips, the 
Founder sank back, limp with 
relief, knowing that he had made 
the final move in a game a cen- 
tury old, and that it had all come 
out in the right way.

“O eynolds Kirby was with his 
therapist when the summons 
came to go to Vorst. The Hemis- 
pheric Coordinator lay in a nu- 
trient bath, an adapted Nothing 
Chamber whose purpose was not 
oblivion but revivification. If 
Kirby had chosen to escape into 
temporary nothingness, he could 
have sealed himself off from the 
universe and entered complete 
suspension. He had long since 
outgrown the need for such 
amusements, though. Now he was 
content to loll in the nutrient 
bath, restoring the vital substanc-

es after a fatiguing day, while an 
esper therapist combed the snags 
from his soul. 

Ordinarily, Kirby did not tol- 
erate interruptions of such ses- 
sions. At his age, he needed all 
the peace he could get. He had 
been born too early to share 
the quasi-immortality of the 
younger generations; his body 
could not snap back to vitality 
the way a 22nd-century man’s 
body could, for he had not had 
the benefit of a century of Vors- 
ter research when he was born. 
There was one exception to Kir- 
by’s rule, however: a summons 
from Vorst took precedence over 
everything, even a session of 
needed therapy. 

The therapist knew it. Deftly 
he brought the session to a pre- 
mature close and fortified Kirby 
for his return to the tensions of 
the world. In less than half an 
hour, the Coordinator was on his 
way to the white dome-roofed 
building where Vorst made his 
headquarters. 

Vorst looked shaky. Kirby had 
never seen the Founder look so 
drained of strength. The vault 
of Vdrst’s forehead was like the 
roof of a skull, and the dark 
eyes blazed with a peculiar dis- 
comfiting intensity. A low pump- 
ing sound was evident in the 
room: Vorst’s machinery, feed- 
ing strength to the ancient body. 
Kirby took the seat toward 



which Vorst beckoned him. 
Strong fingers in the upholstery 
grasped him and began to knead 
the tension out of him. 

Vorst said, “I’ll be calling a 
council meeting in a little while 
to ratify the steps I’ve just taken. 
But before the entire group 
gathers, I want to discuss things 
with you.” 

T^irby’s expression was guard- 
ed. After decades with Vorst, 
he could supply an instant trans- 
lation: I’ve done something auth- 
oritarian, Vorst was saying, and 
I’m going to call in everybody 
to rubber-stamp an okay on it, 
but first I’m going to force a 
rubber-stamping out of you. Kir- 
by was prepared to acquiesce in 
whatever Vorst had done. He 
was not a weak man by nature, 
but one did not dispute the do- 
ings of Vorst. The last one who 
had seriously attempted to try 
was Lazarus, who had slept in 
a box on Mars for sixty years as 
a result. 

Into Kirby’s wary silence Vorst 
murmured, “I’ve talked to Laz- 
arus and closed the deal. He’s 
agreed to supply us with push- 
ers, as many as we need. It’s 
possible we’ll have an interstel- 
lar expedition on its way by the 
end of the year.” 

“I feel a little numb at that, 
Noel.” 

“Anticlimatic, isn’t it? For a 

181

hundred yeart you move an inch 
at a time toward that goal, and 
suddenly you find yourself star- 
ing at the finish line, and the 
thrill of pursuit becomes the 
boredom of accomplishment.” 
“We haven’t landed that ex- 
pedition on another solar sys- 
tem yet,” Kirby reminded the 
Founder quietly. 

“We will. We will. That’s be- 
yond doubt. We’re at the finish 
line now;' Capodimonte’s already 
running personnel checks for the 
expedition. We’ll be outfitting 
the capsule soon. Lazarus’ bunch 
will cooperate, and off we’ll go. 
That much is certain.” 

“How did you get him to agree, 
Noel?” 

“By shovdng him how it will be 
after the expedition has set out. 
Tell me: have you given much 
thought to the goals of the Bro- 
therhood once we’ve sent that 
first expedition?” 

Kirby hesitated. “Well — send- 
ing more expeditions, I guess. 
And consolidating our position. 
Continuing the medical research. 
Carrying on with all our cur- 
rent work.” 

“Exactly. A long smooth slide 
toward utopia. No longer an up- 
hill climb. That’s why I won’t 
stay around to run things any 
longer.” 

“What?” 

“I’m going on the expedition,” 
Vorst said. 



I f Vorst had ripped off one of 
his limbs and clubbed him to 
the floor with it, Kirby would 
not have been more amazed. The 
Founder’s words hit him with an 
almost physical jolt, making him 
recoil. Kirby seized the arms of 
his chair, and in response the 
chair seized him, cradling him 
gently until his spasm of shock 
abated. 

“You’re ^oing?” Kirby blurted. 
“No. No! It’s beyond belief, Noel. 
It’s madness.” 

“My mind’s made up. My 
work on Earth is done. I’ve 
guided the Brotherhood for a 
century, and that’s long enough. 
I’ve seen it take control of Earth, 
and by proxy I have Venus too, 
and I have the cooperation if 
not exactly the support of the 
Martians. I’ve done all I’ve in- 
tended to do here. With the de- 
parture of the first inter.stellar 
expedition, I will have fulfilled 
what I’ll be so gaudy as to call 
my mission on Earth. It’s tb-ne 
to be moving along. I’ll try an- 
other solar system.” 

“We won’t let you go.” Kir!>y 
said, astounded by his own words. 
“You can’t go! At your age — 
to get aboard a capsule bound 
for — ” 

“If I don’t go,” said Vorst, 
“there will be no capsule bound 
for anywhere.” 

“Don’t talk that way, . Noel. 
You sound like a spoiled child 



182 



GALAXY 



threatening to call the party off 
if we don’t play the game your 
way. There are others bound up 
in the Brotherhood too.” 

To Kirby’s surprise, Vorst 
looked merely amused at the 
harsh accusation. “I think you’re 
misinterpreting my words,” he 
said. “I don’t mean to say that 
unless I go along. I’ll halt the 
expedition. I mean that the use 
of Lazarus’s espers is contingent 
on my leaving. If I’m not aboard 
that capsule, he won’t lend his 
pushers.” 

For the second time in ten 
minutes Kirby was rocked by 
amazement. This time there was 
pain, too, for he was aware that 
there had been a betrayal. 

“Is that the deal you made, 
Noel?” 

“It was a fair price to pay. 
A shift of power is long over- 
due. I step out of the picture; 
Lazarus becomes supreme head 
of the movement; you can be 
his vicar on Earth. We get the 
espers. We open the sky. It 
works well for everybody con- 
cerned.” 

“No, Noel.” 

“I’m weary of being here. I 
want to leave. Lazarus wants me 
to leave, too. I’m too big, I 
overtop the entire movement. It’s 
time for mortals to move in. You 
and Lazarus can divide the 
authority. He’ll have the spiritual 
supremacy, but you’ll run Earth. 



The two of you will work out 
some kind of communicant re- 
lation between the Harmonists 
and the Brotherhood. It won’t 
be too hard; the rituals are sim- 
ilar enough. Ten years and any 
lingering bitterness will be gone. 
And I’ll be a dozen light-years 
away, safely out of your path, 
unable to meddle, living in re- 
tirement. Out to pasture on 
World X of System Y. Yes?” 

CtT don’t believe any of this, 
-fi- Noel. That you’d abdicate 
after a century, go swooshing off 
to nowhere with a bunch of pio- 
neers, live in a log cabin on an 
unknown planet at age 150 — ” 
“Start believeing it,” said 
Vorst. For the first time in the 
conversation the old whiplash 
tone returned to his voice. “I’m 
going. It’s decided. In a sense, 
I have gone.” 

“What does that mean?” 

“You know I’m a very low- 
order floater. That I plan things 
by hitchhiking with precogs.” 
“Yes.” 

“I’ve seen the outcome. I know 
how it was, and so I know how 
it’s going to be. I leave. I’ve 
followed the plan this far — fol- 
lowed and led, aU in one, heels 
over head through time. Every- 
thing I’ve done. I’ve had a hint 
beforehand. From founding the 
Brotherhood right to this mo- 
ment. So it’s settled. I go.”

Kirby closed his eyes. He 
struggled for balance. 

Vorst said, “Look back on the 
path I’ve traveled. Was there 
a false step anyv/here? The Bro- 
therhood prospered. It took 
Earth. When we were strong 
enough for a schism, I encour- 
aged Harmonist heresy.” 

“You encouraged — ” 

“I chose Lazarus for what he 
had to do, and filled him full 
of ideas. He was just an insig- 
nificant acolyte, clay in my 
hands. That’s why you never 
knew him in the early days. But 
he was there. I took him. I 



molded him. I got his movement 
going in opposition to ours.” 

“Why, Noel?” 

“It didn’t pay to be monolithic. 
I was hedging my bets. The Bro- 
therhood was designed to win 
Earth, and it did, but the same 
principles didn’t — couldn’t — 
appeal to Venus. So I started a 
second cult. I tailored that one 
for Venus, and gave them Laz- 
arus. Later I gave them Monds- 
chein too. Do you remember that, 
in 2095? He was just a greedy 
little acolyte, but I saw the 
strength in him, and I nudged 
him around until he found him- 
self a changed one on Venus. I 
built that entire organization.” 

( ( ^ nd you knew that they’d 
come up with pushers?” 
Kirby asked incredulously. 



OPEN THE SKY 



185 




“I didn’t know. I hoped. All 
I knew was that, setting up the 
Harmonists was a good idea, 
because I saw that it had been 
a good idea. Follow? For the 
same reason I took Lazarus away 
and hid him in a crypt for sixty 
years. I didn’t know why, at the 
time. But I knew it might be 
useful to keep the Harmonist 
martyr in my pocket for a while, 
as a card to play in the future. 
I played that card twelve years 
ago, and since then the Har- 
monists have been mine. Today 
I played my last card: myself. 
I have to leave. My work is done, 
anyway. I’m bored with running 
oi.it the skein. I’ve juggled every- 
thing for a hundred years, setting 
up my own opposition, creating 
Conflicts designed to lead to an 
ultimate synt’nesis, and that 
synthesis is here, and I’m leav- 
ing.” 

.After a long silence Kirby said, 
“You humiliate me, Noel, by 
a.s’ring me to ratify a decision 
that’s already as immutable as 
the tides and the .sunrise.” 

“You’re free to oppose it at 
the council meeting.” 

“But you’ll go anyway?” 

“Yes. I’d like your support, 
though. It won’t matter to the 
eventual outcome, but I’d still 
rather have you on my side than 
not. I’d like to think that you 
of all people understand what 
I’ve been doing all these years. 



Do you believe there’s any rea- 
son for me to stay on Earth any 
longer?” 

“We need you, Noel. That’s 
the only reason.” 

“Now you're the one who’s be- 
ing childish. You don’t need me. 
The plan is fulfilled. It’s time 
to clear out and turn the job 
over to others. You’re too de- 
pendent on me, Ron. You can’t 
get used to the idea that I’m not 
going to be pulling the strings 
forever.” 

“Perhaps that’s it,” admitted 
Kirby. “But whose fault is that? 
You’ve surrounded yourself with 
yes-men. You’ve made yourself 
indispensable. Here you sit at 
the heart of the movement like 
a sacred fire, and none of us can 
get close enough to be singed. 
Now you’re taking the fire away.” 

“Transferring it,” said Vorst. 
“Here: I’ve got a job for you. 
The members of the council will 
be arriving in six hours. I’m 
going to make my announcement, 
and I suppose it’ll shake every- 
body else the way it shook you. 
Go off by yourself for the next 
six hours and think about all 
I’ve just said. Reconcile your- 
self to it. More: don’t just ac- 
cept it, but approve of it. At the 
meeting, stand up and explain not 
simply why it’s all right if I 
go, but why it’s necessary and 
vital to the future of the Brother- 
hood that I go.”

I n a leafy glade on Venus, 
the pushers were at their sport. 
An avenue of vast trees un- 
rolled toward the pearly hori- 
zon. Their jagged leaves met 
overhead to form a thick canopy. 
Below, on the muddy, fungus- 
dotted ground, a dozen Venus- 
ian boys with bluish skins and 
green robes exercised their abili- 
ties. 

At a distance several larger 
figures watched them. David 
Lazarus stood in the center of 
the group. About him were the 
Harmonist leaders : Christopher 
Mondschein, Nicholas Martell, 
Claude Emory. 

Lazarus had been through a 
great deal at the hands of these 
men. To them, he had been only 
the name of a martyr, and they 
had had to adjust to his return. 
It had not been easy. 

There had been a time when 
Lazarus thought they would put 
him to death. That time was 
past, nov/, and they abided by 
his wishes. But, because he had 
slept so long, he was at once 
younger and older than his lieu- 
tenants, and sometimes that in- 
terfered with the excercising of 
his full authority. 

He said, “It’s settled. Vorst 
v/ill leave and the schism will 
end. I’ll work something out with 
Kirby.” 



“It’s a trap,” said Emory 
gloomily. “Keep away from it, 
David. Vorst can’t be trusted.” 

“Vorst brought me back to 
life.” 

“Vorst put you in that crypt 
in the first place,” Emory in- 
sisted. “You said so yourself.” 

“We can’t te sure of that,” 
Lazarus replied, though it was 
true that Vorst himself had ad- 
mitted the act to him in their 
last conversation. “We’re only 
guessing. There’s no evidence 
that — ” 

Mondschein broke in, “We 
don’t have any reason to trust 
Vorst, Claude. But if he’s really 
and verifiably aboard that cap- 
sule, what de we have to lose by 
pushing him to Betelgeuse or Pro- 
cyon? We’re rid of him, and we’ll 
be dealing with Kirby. Kirby’s 
a reasonable man. None of that 
damnable super-deviousness 
about him.” 

“It’s too pat,” Emory insisted. 
“Why should a man with Vorst’s 
power just step down volun- 
tarily?” 

“Perhaps he’s bored,” said 
Lazarus. “There’s something 
about absolute power that can’t 
be understood except by some- 
one who holds it. It’s dull. You 
can enjoy moving and shaking 
the world for twenty years, 
thirty, fifty — but Vorst’s been 
on top for a hundred. He wants 
to move along. I say take the 



OPEN THE SKY 



187 



offer. We’re well rid of him, and 
we can handle Kirby. Besides, 
he’s got a good point. Neither 
his side nor ours can get to the 
stars without the help of the 
other. I’m for it. It’s worth the 
try.” 

. *• 

TVJicholas Martell gestured to- 

’ ward the pushers. “We’ll lose 
some of them, don’t forget. You 
can’t push a capsule to the stars 
without overloading the push- 
ers.” 

“Vorst has offered rehabilita- 
tion services,” said Lazarus. 

“One other point,” Mondschein 
remarked. “Under the new de- 
tente, we’d have access to Vors- 
ter hospitals ourselves. Just as 
a purely selfish matter, I’d like 
that. I think the time has come 
to turn away from haughtiness 
and give in to Vorst. He’s will- 
ing to check out. All right. Let 
him go, and look for our own 
advantage with Kirby.” 

Lazarus smiled. He had not 
hoped to win Mondschein’s sup- 
port that easily. But Mondschein 
was old, past ninety, and he 
was hungry for the care that 
Vorster medics could give him, 
care that was not to be had on 
rugged Venus. Mondschein had 
seen the Santa Fe hospitals him- 
self, when he was a young man, 
and he knew what miracles they 
could perform. It was not a 
terribly worthy motive, thought 



Lazarus. But it was a human 
motive, at least, and Monschein 
was human behind his gills and 
blued skin. So are we all, Laz- 
arus realized. Though they 
aren’t. 

He looked toward the push- 
ers. They were fifth and sixth 
generation Venusians. The seed 
of Earth was in them, but they 
were far removed from the orig- 
inal stock. The genetic manipula- 
tions that had first adapted man- 
kind for life on Venus bred true; 
these boys were something other 
than human by this time. They 
were intent on their games. It 
was little effort for them to 
transport objects great distances 
now. They could send each other 
around Venus virtually instan- 
taneously, or hurl a boulder to 
Earth in an hour or tv/o. What 
they could not do was transport 
themselves, for they needed a 
fulcrum to do their pushing with. 
But that was minor. They could 
not flit from place to place on 
the strength of their own powers, 
but they could thrust each other 
about. 

Lazarus watched them : ap- 
pearing, disappearing, lifting, 
throwing. Only children, not yet 
in full command of their pow- 
ers. What strengths would be 
theirs when they were fully ma- 
ture, he wondered? 

And how many would die to 
send mankind beyond his pres- 



188 



GALAXY 



ent boundaries? 

A saw-winged bird, faintly 
luminous in the midday dusk, 
shot diagonally across the sky 
just above the treetop canopy. 
One of the young pushers looked 
up, grinned, caught the bird and 
sent it whirling half a mile 
through the clouds. A squawk 
of rage, distant but audible, fil- 
tered back. 

Lazarus said, “The deal is 
closed. We help Vorst, and Vorst 
goes. Etone?” 

“Done,” said Mondschein 
quickly. 

“Done,” Martell murmured, 
scuffing at the grayish moss that 
festooned the ground. 

“Claude?” Lazarus asked. 

Emory scowled. He peered at 
a long-limbed boy, returning 
from a jaunt to some other con- 
tinent, who materialized no more 
than six yards away. Emory’s 
narrow-featured face looked dark 
with tension. 

“Done,” he said. 

VII 

'■y^he capsule was an obelisk of 
beryllium steel, fifty feet 
high, an uncertain ark to send 
across the sea of stars. It con- 
tained living quarters for eleven, 
a computer of uncomfortably 
awe-inspiring abilities and a sub- 
miniattwized treasury of all that 
was worth salvaging from two 



billion years of life on Earth. 

“Prepare the capsule,” Vorst 
had instructed Brother Capodi- 
monte, “ as though the sun were 
going nova next month and we 
had to save what was important.” 

Capodimonte, who had been an 
anthropologist before turning to 
the Brotherhood, had his own 
ideas about the contents of such 
an ark, but he kept them separ- 
ate from his concept of what 
Vorst required. Quietly, a sub- 
committee of Brothers had 
planned the interstellar expedi- 
tion on a someday-far-away bas- 
is decades ago, and had re- 
planned it several times, so that 
Capodimonte had the benefit of 
the thinking of other men. That 
was a comfort to him. 

There were troublesome ele- 
ments of mystery about the pro- 
ject. He did not, for example, 
know the nature of the world 
to which the pioneers were 
bound. No one did. There was 
no telling, at this distance, whe- 
ther it really could harbor Ter- 
ran-style life. 

Astronomers had founds hun- 
dreds of planets scattered through 
other systems. Some could dim- 
ly be picked up by telescopic 
sensors; others could only be in- 
ferred from computations of dis- 
turbed stellar orbits. But the 
planets were there. Would they 
welcome Earthmen? 

Only one planet out of nine 

189 



OPEN THE SKY 



in Earth’s own system was nat- 
urally habitable, not a cheering 
prognosis for other systems. It 
had taken two generations of 
hard work to terraform Mars; 
the eleven pioneers would hardly 
be able to do that. It had taken 
the highest genetic skiUs to con- 
vert men into Venusians; that, 
too, would be beyond the range 
of the voyagers. They would 
have to find a suitable world, 
or fail. 

Espers in the Santa Fe re- 
tinue said that suitable worlds 
existed. They had peered into 
the heavens, reached forth their 
minds, made contact with tan- 
gible and habitable planets out 
there. Illusion? Deception? Cap- 
odimonte was in no position to 
determine that. 



O eynolds Kirby, troubled by 
the project from first to last, 
said to Capodimonte, “Is it true 
that they don’t even know what 
star they’ll be aiming for?” 
“That’s true. They’ve detected 
some kind of emanations coming 
from somewhere. Don’t ask me 
how. The way this thing is 
planned, our espers will supply 
the guidance and their pushers 
will supply the propulsion. We 
find, they heave.” 

“A voyage to anywhere?” 
“To anywhere,” Capodimonte 
agreed. “They rip a hole in the 
sky and shove the capsule 



through. It doesnt travel through 
normal space, whatever normal 
space is. It lands on this world 
that our espers claim to have 
connected with out there, and 
they send a message back, tell- 
ing us where they are. We get 
the message about a generation 
from now. But meanwhile we’ll 
have sent other expeditions. A 
one-way journey to nowhere. 
And Vorst is the first to take 
it.” 

Kirby shook his head. “It’s 
hard to believe, isn’t it? But 
evidently it’s going to be a suc- 
cess.” 

“Oh?” 

“Yes. Vorst had his floaters 
out there looking, you see. They 
tell him that he arrived safely. 
So he’s willing to step out into 
the dark, because he knows in 
advance that he’s not running 
any risks.” 

“Do you believe that?” asked 
Capodimonte, .shuffling through 
his inventory sheets. 

“No.” 

Neither did Brother Capodi- 
monte. But he did not quarrel 
with the role assigned to him. He 
had been at the council meet- 
ing where Vorst had announced 
his stunning intention, and he 
had heard Reynolds Kirby rise 
and eloquently argue the case 
for allowing the Founder to de- 
part. Kirby’s thesis had been a 
sound one, within the context of 



190 



GALAXY 



nightmare that this whole pro- 
ject embraced. And so the cap- 
sule would leave, powered by the 
joint efforts of some blue-skin- 
ned boys, and guided on a thread 
through the heavens by the 
roving minds of Brotherhood es- 
pers. 

And Noel Vorst would never 
walk the Earth again. 

VIII 

I t was the day of departure. 

Chill winter winds raked New 
Mexico on this late-December 
day. The capsule stood in a des- 
ert flat a dozen miles from the 
inner compound of the Santa Fe 
research center. From here to the 
horizon it was a wilderness of 
sagebrush and juniper and pin- 
yon pine; and in the distance the 
bowl of mountains rose. Though 
he was well insulated, Reynolds 
Kirby shivered as the wind as- 
sailed the plateau. In another 
few days, the year 2165 would 
be dawning, but Noel Vorst 
would not be here to welcome 
it. Kirby was not accustomed to 
that idea yet. 

The pushers from Venus had 
arrived a week ago. There were 
twenty of them, and since it 
was inconvenient for them to live 
in breathing-suits all their time 
on Earth, the Vorsters had erect- 
ed a little bit of Venus for them. 
A domed building not far from 



the capsule housed them; it was 
pumped full of the poisonous 
muck that they were accustomed 
to breathing. Lazarus and Mond- 
schein had come with them, and 
were under the dome now, get- 
ting everything prepared. 

Mondschein would remain after 
the event, to undergo an over- 
hauling in Santa Fe. Lazarus was 
going back to Venus in a couple 
of days. But first he and Kirby 
would face each other across a 
conference table and hammer out 
the first clauses of the new en- 
tente. They had met once, twelve 
years ago, but not for long. Since 
Lazarus’ arrival on Earth, Kirby 
had spoken briefly to him, and 
had come away with the feeling 
that the Harmonist prophet, 
though strong-willed and pur- 
poseful, would not be difficult 
ultimately to reach understand- 
ings with. He hoped not. 

Now, on the wintry plateau, 
the high leaders of the Brother- 
hood of the Immanent Radiance 
were gathering to watch their 
leader vanish. Kirby, glancing 
around, saw Capodimonte and 
Mangus and Ashton and Lang- 
holt and all the others, dozens 
of them, spiralling down the ech- 
elons into the middle levels of 
the organization. They were all 
watching him. They could not 
watch Vorst, for Vorst was in the 
capsule already, along with the 
other members of the expedi- 



OPEN THE SKY

tion. Five men, five women, and 
Vorst. All of the others under 
forty, healthy, capable, resilient. 
And Vorst. The Founder’s quar- 
ters aboard the capsule were 
comfortable, but it was lunacy 
to think of that old man plung- 
ing into the universe like this. 

Qupervisor Mangus, the Eu- 
^ uropaan Coordinator, step- 
ped to Kirby’s side. He was a 
.<3m.all, sharp-featured man who, 
like most of the other leaders of 
the Brotherhood, had served in 
its ranks over seventy years. 

“He’s actually going,” Mangus 
said. 

“Soon. Yes. No doubt of it.” 

“Did you speak to him this 
morning?” 

“Briefly,” Kirby said. “He 
seems very calm.” 

“He seemed very calm when 
he blessed us last night,” said 
Magnus. “Almost joyful.” 

“He’s putting down a great 
burden. You’d be joyful too if 
you could be translated into the 
sky and shrug off your respon- 
sibilities.” 

Magnus said, “I wish we could 
prevent this.” 

Kirby turned and looked 
bluntly at the little man. “This 
is a necessary thing,” he said. “It 
must happen or the movement 
will founder of its own success.” 

“I heard your speech before 
the council, yes, but — ”

“We’ve reached the fulfillment 
level of our first evolutionary 
stages,” said Kirby. “Now we 
need to extend our mythology. 
Symbolically, Vorst’s departure 
is invaluable to us. He ascends 
into the sky, leaving us to carry 
on his work and go on to new 
purposes. If he remained, we’d 
begin to mark time. Now we can 
use his glorious example to in- 
spire us. With Vorst leading the 
way to the new worlds, we who 
remain can build on the founda- 
tion he bequeathes us.” 

“You sound as though you be- 
lieve it.” 

“I do,” said Kirby. “I didn’t, 
at first. But Vorst was right. He 
said I’d understand why he was 
going, and I came to sec it. He’s 
ten times as valuable to the 
movement doing this than he 
would be if he remained.” 

Magnus murmured, “He isn’t 
content to be Christ and Mo- 
hammed. He has to be Moses 
too, and also Elijah.” 

“I never thought I’d hear you 
speak of him so coarsely,” said 
Kirby. 

“I never did either,” Magnus 
replied. “Dammit, I don’t want 
him to go!” 

Kirby was astonished to see 
tears glistening in Magnus’ pale 
eyes. 

“That’s precisely why he’s 
leaving,” Kirby said, and then 
both men were silent.

moved toward 
them. “Everything’s ready,” 
he announced. “I’ve got the word 
from Lazarus that the pushers 
are in series.” 

“What about our guidance 
people?” Kirby asked. 

“They’ve been ready for an 
hour.” 

Kirby looked toward the 
gleaming capsule. “Might as well 
get it over with, then.” 

“Yes,” Capodimonte said. 
“Might as well.” 

Lazarus, Kirby knew, was 
waiting for a signal from him. 
From now on, all signals would 
come from him. But that thought 
no longer disturbed him. He had 
adjusted to the situation. He was 
in command. 

Symbolic regalia cluttered the 
field — Harmonist ikons, a big 
cobalt reactor, the paraphernalia 
of both the cults that now were 
merging. Kirby gestured to an 
acolyte, and moderator rods were 
withdrawn. The reactor surged 
into life. 

The Blue Fire danced high 
above the reactor, and its glow 
stained the hull of the capsule. 
CoUl light, Cerenkov radiation, 
the Vorster symbol, sparkled on 
the iilaleau, and all through the 
walrhmg multitude ran the 
so\im<In of devotion, the whispered 
litanies, was tlie murmured re- 
capilnliitionn of the stations of 
th«> s|ii'(lnim. While the man 



who had devised those words sat 
hidden within the walls of that 
teardrop of steel in the center of 
the gathering. 

The flare of the Blue Fire was 
the signal to the Venusians in 
their nearby dome. Now was 
their moment to gather their 
power and hurl the capsule out- 
ward, planting man’s hand on a 
new world in the stars. 

“What are they waiting for?” 
Magnus asked querulously. 

“Maybe it won’t happen,” said 
Capodimonte. 

Kirby said nothing. And then 
it began to happen.

irby had not quite known 
what to expect. In his fan- 
tasies of the scene, he had pic- 
tured a dozen capering Venus- 
ians dancing around the capsule, 
holding hands, their foreheads 
bulging with the effort of lifting 
the vehicle and hurling it out of 
the world. But the Venusians 
were nowhere to be seen; they 
were off in their dome, several 
hundred yards away, and Kirby 
suspected that they were neither 
holding hands nor showing out- 
ward signs of strain. 

In his reveries, too, he had im- 
agined the capsule taking off the 
way a rocket would, rising a few 
feet from the ground, wobbling 
a bit, rising a little more, sudden- 



OPEN Mil SKY

ly soaring up, crossing the sky 
on a potent trajectory, dwin- 
dling, vanishing from sight at 
last. But that was not the way it 
was really to be, either. 

He waited. A long moment 
passed. 

He thought of Vorst, making 
landfall on some other world. An 
inhabited world, perhaps? What 
would be Vorst’s impact, when 
he came to that virgin territory? 
Vorst was an irresistible force, 
terrifying and unique. Wherever 
he went, he would transform all 
that was about him. Kirby felt 
sorry for the ten hapless pioneers 
who would have the benefit of 
Vorst’s immediate guidance. He 
wondered what kind of colony 
they would build. 

Whatever it was, it would suc- 
ceed. Success was in Vorst’s na- 
ture. He was hideously old, but 
he had frightening vitality still 
locked within him. The Founder 
seemed to relish the challenge of 
beginning anew. Kirby wished 
him well. 

“There they go,” Capodimonte 
whispered. 

It was true. The capsule was 
still on the ground, but now the 
air about it wavered, as though 
stirred by heat waves rising from 
the parched sandy soil. 

Then the capsule was gone. 

That was all. Kirby stared at 
the empty place where it had 
been. Vorst had been taken up 



into the heavens, and a gateway 
to somewhere had been opened. 

“There is a Oneness from 
which all life stems,” someone 
said gently behind Kirby. “The 
infinite variety of the universe 
we owe to — ” 

Another voice said, “Man and 
woman, star and stone, tree and 
bird — ” 

Another said, “In the strength 
of the spectrum, the quantum, 
and the holy angstrom — ” 

l^irby did not remain to listen 
to the familiar prayers, nor 
did he pray himself. He looked 
briefly at the bareness in the 
desert once more, and then up- 
ward at the harsh blue sky, al- 
ready deepening toward night- 
fall. It was done. Vorst was gone, 
his scheming ended so far as 
Earth was concerned, and now 
it was the turn of lesser men. 
The way was open. Humanity 
could spill out across the heav- 
ens. Perhaps. Perhaps. 

Alone in this great assembly of 
the faithful Kirby turned his 
back on the now sacred spot 
from which Vorst had made his 
ascent. Very slowly, a tall figure 
whose late-afternoon shadow 
stretched for yards, Kirby 
walked away from the place 
where Noel Vorst had been, and 
toward the place where David 
Lazarus was waiting for him.

Could you write 
for television? 

By Max Shulman 



X rankly, I don’t know. But this I do know: 
when I was running the Dobie Gillis show, 
I often paid $2,500 and more for scripts 
turned out by people who should have been 
arrested for impersonating writers- 

How such people got to be high-priced 
TV writers .is not as mysterious as it seems. 
Television is an insatiable maw into which 
scripts must be fed at a rate unprecedented 
in the history of entertainment. It is a grate- 
ful producer indeed who consistently gets 
scripts which have been written with real 
understanding of television’s powers and 
limitations. 

To help train new TV writers, I joined 
with Rod Serling (creator of The Twilight 
Zone, winner of five Emmy Awards) and 
ten other leading authors* to start the 
Famous Writers School. We pooled every- 
thing we had learned in our long years in the 
business to devise four professional writing 
courses that men and women, seriously in- 
terested in writing, could take in their own 
homes in their free time. 

How to write “with a lens” 

All four of our courses give you a solid 
foundation in basic writing skills. And three 
of them (Fiction, Non-Fiction and Adver- 
tising) give you training in the techniques 
of television. You learn to build interesting, 
believable characters; how to write dialogue 
that rings true; how to plot convincingly. 
Therf you develop the specialized approach 
that TV demands: the facility to tell your

story (or documentary or commercial) in 
quick, visual sequences , . , the knack ol 
thinking and writing with a lens! 

Through a series of carefully planned 
assignments, you learn as you write— giiideil 
by our own specially organized textbooks. 
Your assignments are painstakingly cdiled 
and revised by our staff of instructors, theni- 
selves all professional writers. Under onr 
supervision, an instructor works with you 
by mail, much as a producer or editor works 
with an established writer. 

Do you have an aptitude for writing? 

To help you (and us) decide whether you’ve 
got the stufi' to be a writer, we have worked 
up a revealing aptitude test. The coupon 
below will bring you a copy, along with a 
48-page School brochure. If your test indi- 
cates aptitude, you are eligible to enroll in 
the School. You are, however, under no ob- 
ligation to do so.
