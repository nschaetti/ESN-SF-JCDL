POLITICS - 21st CENTURY STYLE 



rpntering our quadrennial busi- 
■*— ' ness of electing an American 
president with the usual mixture 
of anticipation and dread, our 
thoughts are beginning to turn 
to politics. So, as you will observe 
beginning of page 165 of this 
issue, are the thoughts of science- 
fiction writers. And of course, the 
kind of politics Wyman Guin is 
thinking about are rather remote 
in space and time from our own 
. they are, in fact, that long 
view of events that science fiction 
gives us better than any other 
form of reading ever committed 
to paper and print; because 
Guin’s politicians are not merely 
other than Democrats and Re- 
publicans. They are other than 
human! 

But all too human in their ap- 
proach to the serious problem of 
governing their world. 

A personal note might be in 
order here. As a natural conse- 
quence of having registered in 
one of America’s two political 
parties in an area where the oth- 



er party had long held a monopo- 
ly of election victories, I’ve spent 
most of my Novembers for the 
past few years either running for 
an office or helping some other 
candidates run for an office. 

As a result of this rather ex- 
pensively obtained education. I 
would like to suggest a fact of 
political life that doesn’t seem to 
be widely known. That is : In an 
election, hardly anyone votes for 
a candidate; what they actually 
go to the polls to do is to vote 
against his opponent. There are 
many reasons for this, but what 
seems to me to be the significant 
one is that American political 
parties don’t really embody dif- 
fering political philosophies; it is 
a matter of personality that 
brings the vote out. And of 
course, we are always quicker to 
express dislike than we are fond- 
ness .... 

But if the parties are totally 
different . well, read Wyman 
Guin’s story and see.

THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told — things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
and accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass fear and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes toMy.

THE 

DEAD LADY OF 
CLOWN TOWN 

BY CORDWAiNER SMITH 



lllusarated by MORROW 



She was bom and bred to heal 
my IH — in an age which had 
forgot the habit of sickness] 



I 

Y ou already know the end — 
the immense drama of the 
L<»d Jestocost, seventh of his 
Bne, and how the cat-girl C’mell 
kutiated the vast conspiracy. But 
you do not know the beginning, 
kow the first Lord Jestocost got 



his name, because of the terror 
and inspiration which his mother, 
the Lady Goroke, obtained from 
the famous real-life drama of the 
dog-girl D’joan. It is even less 
likely tliat you know the other 
story — the one behind D’joan. 
This story is sometimes mention- 
ed as the matter of the “name- 



6 




1ms witch,” which is absurd, be- 
cause she really had a name. The 
■ame was “Klaine,” an ancient 
and forbidden one. 

Elaine was a mistake. Her 
birth, her life, her career were all 
mistakes. The ruby was wrong. 
How could that have happened? 

G o back to An-fang, the Peace 
Square at An-fang, the Be- 
ginning Place at An-fang, where 
■11 things start. Bright it was. Red 
square, dead square, clear square, 
under a yellow sun. 

This was Earth Original, Man- 
home itself, where Earthport 
thrusts its way up through hur- 
ricane clouds that are higher 
than the mountains. 

An-fang was near a city, the 
only living city with a pre-atomic 
name. The lovely meaningless 
name was Meeya Meefla, where 
the lines of ancient roadways, 
untouched by a wheel for thou- 
sands of years, forever paralleled 
the warm, bright, clear beaches 
of the Old South East. 

The headquarters of the People 
Programmer was at An-fang, and 
there the mistake happened: 

A ruby trembled. Two tourma- 
line nets failed to rectify the laser 
beam. A diamond noted the error. 
Both the error and the correc- 
tion went into the general com- 
puter. 

The error assigned, on the gen- 
eral account of births for Fomal- 

8 



haut III, the profession of “lay 
therapist, female, intuitive capa- 
city for correction of human 
physiology with local resources.” 
On some of the early ships they 
used to call these people witch- 
women, because they worked un- 
accountable cures. For pioneer 
parties, these lay therapists were 
invaluable; in settled post-Ries- 
mannian societies, they became 
an awful nuisance. Sickness dis- 
appeared with good conditions, 
accidents dwindled down to noth- 
ing, medical work became insti- 
tutional. 

Who wants a witch, even a 
good witch, when a thousand-bed 
hospital is waiting with its staff 
eager for clinical experience . 
and only seven out of its thou- 
sand beds filled with real people? 
(The remaining beds were filled 
with lifelike robots on which the 
staff could practice, lest they lose 
their morale. They could, of 
course, have worked on under- 
people — animals in the shape of 
human beings, who did the heavy 
and the weary work which re- 
mained as the caput mortuum of 
a really perfected economy — 
but it was against the law for 
animals, even when they were 
underpeople, to go to a human 
hospital. When underpeople got 
sick, the Instrumentality took 
care of them — in slaughter- 
houses. It was easier to breed 
new underpeople for the job than 



GALAXY 



it was to repair sick ones. Furth- 
ermore, the tender, loving care 
of a hospital might give them 
ideas. Such as the idea that they 
were people. This would have 
been bad, from the prevailing 
point of view. Therefore the hu- 
man hospitals remained almost 
empty while an underperson who 
sneezed four times or who vomit- 
ed once was taken away, never 
to be ill again. The empty beds 
kept on with the robot patients, 
who went through endless repe- 
titions of the human patterns of 
injury or disease.) This left no 
work for witches, bred and train- 
ed. 

Yet the ruby had trembled; 
the program had indeed made a 
mistake; the birth-number for a 
‘lay therapist, general, female, 
immediate use” had been order- 
ed for Fomalhaut III. 

M uch later, when the story 
was all done down to its 
last historic detail, there was an 
investigation into the origins of 
Elaine. When the laser had trem- 
bled, both the original order and 
the correction were fed simul- 
taneously into the machine. The 
machine recognized the contra- 
diction and promptly referred 
both papers to the human super- 
visor, an actual man who had 
been working on the job for seven 
years. 

He was studying music, and 



he was bored. He was so cloM 
to the end of his term that h« 
was already counting the days 
to his own release. Meanwhile 
he was rearranging two popular 
songs. One was The Big Bamboo, 
a primitive piece which tried to 
evoke the original magic of man. 
The other was about a girl, 
Elaine, Elaine whom the song 
asked to refrain from giving pain 
to her loving swain. Neither of 
the songs was important; but be- 
tween them they influenced his- 
tory, first a little bit and then 
very much. 

The musician had plenty of 
time to practice. He had not had 
to meet a real emergency in aU 
his seven years. From time to 
time the machine made reports 
to him, but the musician just 
told the machine to correct its 
own errors, and it infallibly did 
so. 

On the day that the accident^ 
of Elaine happened, he was try- 
ing to perfect his finger work on 
the guitar, a very old instrument 
believed to date from the pre- 
space period. He was playing 
The Big Bamboo for the hun- 
dredth time. 

The machine announced its 
mistake with an initial musical 
chime. The supervisor had long 
since forgotten all the instruc- 
tions which he had so worri- 
somely memorized seven long 
years ago. The alert did not 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



9 



really and truly matter, because 
the machine invariably corrected 
its own mistakes whether the su- 
pervisor was on duty or not. 

The machine, not having its 
chime answered, moved into a 
second-stage alarm. From a loud- 
speaker set in the wall of the 
room, it shrieked in a high, clear 
human voice, the voice of some 
employee who had died thou- 
sands of years earlier: 

“Alert, alert! Emergency. Cor- 
rection needed. Correction need- 
ed!” 

The answer was one which the 
machine had never heard before, 
old though it was. The musician’s 
fingers ran madly, gladly over 
the guitar strings and he sang 
clearly, wildly back to the ma- 
chine a message strange beyond 
any machine’s belief: 

Beat, beat the Big Bamboo! 

Beat, beat, beat the Big Bamboo fop 

me . ! 

Hastily the machine set its 
memory banks and computers to 
work, looking for the code refer- 
ence to “bamboo,” trying to make 
that word fit the present context. 
There was no reference at all. 
The machine pestered the man 
some more. 

“Instructions unclear. Instruc- 
tions unclear. Please correct.” 

“Shut up,” said the man. 

“Cannot comply,” stated the 
machine. “Please state and re- 

10 



peat, please state and repeat, 
please state and repeat.” 

“Do shut up,” said the man, 
but he knew the machine would 
not obey this. Without thinking, 
he turned to his other tune and 
sang the first two lines twice 
over: 

Elaine. Elaine, 

go cure the pain! 

Elaine, Elaine, 

go cure the pain! 

Repetition had been inserted as 
a safeguard into the machine, on 
the assumption that no real man 
would repeat an error. The name 
“Elaine” was not correct number 
code, but the fourfold emphasis 
seemed to confirm the need for 
a “lay therapist, female.” The 
machine itself noted that a genu- 
ine man had corrected the situa- 
tion card presented as a matter 
of emergency. 

“Accepted,” said the machine. 

This word, too late, jolted the 
supervisor away from his music. 

“Accepted what?” he asked. 

There was no answering voice. 
There was no sound at all except 
for the whisper of slightly-moist- 
ened warm air through the ven- 
tilators. 

The supervisor looked out the 
window. He could see a little of 
the blood-black red color of the 
Peace Square of An-fang; beyond 
lay the ocean, endlessly beau- 
tiful and endlessly tedious. 



GALAXY 



The supervisor sighed hopeful- 
ly. He was young. “Guess it 
doesn’t matter,” he thought, pick- 
ing up his guitar. 

(Thirty-seven years later, he 
found out that it did matter. The 
Lady Goroke herself, one of the 
chiefs of the Instrumentality, sent 
a subchief of the Instrumentality 
to find out who had caused D’- 
joan. When the man found that 
the witch Elaine, was the source 
of the trouble she sent him on to 
find out how Elaine had gotten 
into a well-ordered universe. The 
supervisor was found. He was 
still a musician. He remembered 
nothing of the story. He was hyp- 
notized. He still remembered 
nothing. The sub-chief invoked 
an emergency and Police Drug 
Four (“clear memory”) was ad- 
ministered to the musician. He 
immediately remembered the 
whole silly scene, but insisted 
that it did not matter. The case 
was referred to Lady Goroke, 
who instructed the authorities 
that the musician be told the 
whole horrible, beautiful story of 
D’joan at Fomalhaut — the very 
story which you are now being 
told — and he wept. He was not 
punished otherwise, but the Lady 
Goroke commanded that those 
memories be left in his mind fct 
so long as he might live.) 

The man picked up his guitar, 
but the machine went on about 
its work. 



It selected a fertilized human 
embryo, tagged it with the freak- 
ish name “Elaine,” irradiated the 
genetic code with strong apti- 
tudes for witchcraft and then 
marked the person’s card for 
training in medicine, transporta- 
tion by sailship to Fomalhaut III 
and release for service on the 
planet. 

Elaine was bom without being 
needed, without being wanted, 
without having a skill which 
could help or hurt any existing 
human being. She went into life 
doomed and useless. 

It is not remarkable that she 
was misbegotten. Errors do hap- 
pen. Remarkable was the fact 
that she managed to survive 
without being altered, corrected 
or killed by the safety devices 
which mankind has installed in 
society for its own protection. 

Unwanted, unused, she wand- 
ered through the tedious months 
and useless years of her own 
existence. She was well fed, rich- 
ly clothed, variously housed. She 
had machines and robots to serve 
her, underpeople to obey her, 
people to protect her against one 
another or against herself, should 
the need arise. But she could 
never find work; without work, 
she had no time for love; without 
work or love, she had no hope 
at all. 

If she had only stumbled int« 
the right experts or the right au- 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



11 



thorities, they would hove alter- 
ed or re-trained her_. This would 
have made her into an accept- 
able woman; but she did not find 
the police, nor did they find her. 
She was helpless to correct her 
own programming, utterly help- 
less. It had been imposed on her 
at An-fang, way back at An- 
fang, where all things begin. 

The ruby had trembled, the 
tourmaline failed, the diamond 
passed unsupported. Thus, a wo- 
man was bom doomed, 

II 

M uch later, when people 
made songs about the 
strange case of the dog-girl D’- 
joan, the minstrels and singers 
had tried to imagine what Elaine 
felt like, and they had made up 
The Song of Elaine for her. It is 
not authentic, but it shows how 
Elaine looked at her own life 
before the strange case of D’joan 
began to flow from Elaine’s own 
actions: 

other women hate me. 

Men never touch me. 

I am too much me. 

I’ll he a witch! 

Mama never towelled me. 

Daddy never growled me 
Little kiddles grate me 
I’ll be a bitch! 

People never named me 
Dogs never shamed me 
Oh. I am a such me! 

I’ll be a witch. 

I’ll meike them shun me. 

They’ll never run me. 

Could they even stun met 
I’ll be a witch. 



Let them aU attac* ma. 

They can only rack mo. 

Me — I can hack me. 

I’U be a witch. 

Other women hate me. 

Men never touch me. 

I am too much me. 

I’ll be a witch. 

The song overstates the case. 
Women did not hate Elaine; they 
did not look at her. Men did not 
shun Elaine; they did not notice 
her either. There were no places 
on Fomalhaut III where she 
could have met human children, 
for the nurseries were far under- 
ground because of chancy radia- 
tion and fierce weather. The song 
pretends that Elaine began with 
the thought that she was not 
human, but underpeople, and had 
herself been born a dog. This 
did not happen at the beginning 
of the case, but only at the very 
end, when the story of D’joan 
was already being carried be- 
tween the stars and developing 
with all the new twists of folk- 
lore and legend. She never went 
mad. 

(“Madness” is a rare condition, 
consisting of a human mind which 
does not engage its environment 
correctly. Elaine approached it 
before she met D’joan. Elaine 
was not the only case, but she 
was a rare and genuine one. Her 
life, thrust back from aU attempts 
at growth, had turned back on 
itself and her mind had spiraled 
inward to the only safety she 
could really know, psychosis. 



12 



GALAXY 



Madness is always better than 
X, and X to each patient is in- 
dividual, personal, secret and ov- 
erwhelmingly important. Elaine 
had gone normally mad; her im- 
printed and destined career was 
the wrong one. “Lay therapists, 
female” were coded to work de- 
cisively, autonomously, on their 
own authority and with great ra- 
pidity. These working conditions 
were needed on new planets. 
They were not coded to consult 
other people; most places, there 
would be no one to consult. 
Elaine did what was set for her 
at An-fang, all the way down to 
the individual chemical condi- 
tions of her spinal fluid. She was 
herself the wrong and she never 
knew it. Madness was much 
kinder than the realization that 
she was not herself, should not 
have lived, and amounted at the 
most to a mistake committed be- 
tween a trembling ruby and a 
young, careless man with a gui- 
tar.) 

She found D’joan and the 
worlds reeled. 

Their meeting occurred at a 
place nicknamed “the edge of 
the world,” where the undercity 
met daylight. This was itself un- 
usual; but Fomalhaut III was 
an unusual and uncomfortable 
planet, where wild weather and 
men’s caprice drove architects 
to furious design and grotesque 
execution. 



"1^ laine walked through the 
^ city, secretly mad, looking 
for sick people whom she could 
help. She had been stamped, im- 
printed, designed, born, bred and 
trained for this task. Ther§ was 
no task. 

She was an intelligent woman. 
Bright brains serve madness as 
well as they serve sanity — name- 
ly, very well indeed. It never 
occurred to her to give up her 
mission. 

The people of Fomalhaut III, 
like the people of Manhome 
Earth itself, are almost uniform- 
ly handsome; it is only in the 
far-out, half-unreachable worlds 
that the human stock, strained by 
the sheer effort to survive, be- 
comes ugly, weary or varied. She 
did not look much different from 
the other intelligent, handsome 
people who flocked the streets. 
Her hair was black, and she was 
tall. Her arms and legs were long, 
the trunk of her body short. She 
wore her hair brushed straight 
back from a high, narrow, square 
forehead. Her eyes were an odd 
deep blue. Her mouth might have 
been pretty, but it never smiled, 
so that no one could really tell 
whether it was beautiful or not 
She stood erect and proud: but 
so did everyone else. Her mouth 
was strange in its very lack of 
communicativeness and her eyes 
swept back and forth, back and 
forth like ancient radar, looking 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



13 



lor the sick, the n^edy, and 
stricken, whom she had a passion 
to serve. 

How could she be unhappy? 
She had never had time to be 
hapoy- It was easy for her to 
think that happiness was some- 
thing which disappeared at the 
end of childhood. Now and then, 
here and there, perhaps when a 
fountain murmured in sunlight 
or when leaves exploded in the 
startling Fomalhautian spring, 
she wondered that other people 

— people as responsible as her- 
self by the doom of age, grade, 
sex, training and career number 

— should be happy when she 
alone seemed to have no time for 
happiness. But she always dis- 
missed the thought and walked 
the ramps and streets until her 
arches ached, looking for work 
which did not yet exist. 

Human flesh, older than his- 
tory, more dogged than culture, 
has its own wisdom. The bodies 
of people are marked with the 
archaic ruses of survival, so that 
on Fomalhaut III, Elaine herself 
preserved the skills of ancestors 
she never even thought about — 
those ancestors, who in the in- 
credible and remote past, had 
mastered terrible Earth itself. 
Elaine was mad. But there was 
a part of her which suspected 
that she was mad. 

Perhaps this wisdom seized 
her as she walked from Water- 



rocky Road toward the bright 
esplanades of the Shopping Bar. 
She saw a forgotten door. The 
robots could clean near it but, 
because of the old, odd, archi- 
tectural shape, they could not 
sweep and polish right at the 
bottom line of the door. A thin 
hard line of old dust and caked 
polish lay like a sealant at the 
base of the doorline. It was ob- 
vious that no one had gone 
through for a long, long time. 

The civilized rule was that pro- 
hibited areas were marked both 
telepathically and with symbols. 
The most dangerous of all had 
robot or underpeople guards. But 
everything which was not pro- 
hibited, was permitted. Thus 
Elaine had no right to open the 
door, but she had no obligation 
not to do so. She opened it — 

By sheer caprice. 

Or so she thought. 

This was a far cry from the 
“I’ll be a witch” motif attribut- 
ed to her in the later ballad. She 
was not yet frantic, not yet des- 
perate, she was not yet even 
noble. 

That opening of a door chang- 
ed her own world and changed 
life on thousands of planets for 
generations to come, but the 
opening was not itself strange. It 
was the tired caprice of a thor- 
oughly frustrated and mildly un- 
happy woman. Nothing more. All 
the other descriptions of it have 



14 



GALAXY 



been improvements, embellish- 
ments, falsifications. 

She did get a shock when she 
opened the door, but not for the 
reasons attributed backwards to 
her by balladists and historians. 

S he was shocked because the 
door opened on steps and the 
steps led down to landscape and 
sunlight — truly an unexpected 
sight on any world. She was look- 
ing from the New City to the 
Old City. The New City rose 
on its shell out over the old city, 
and when she looked “indoors” 
she saw the sunset in the city 
below. She gasped at the beauty 
and the unexpectedness of it. 

There, the open door — with 
another world beyond it. Here, 
the old familiar street, clean, 
handsome, quiet, useless, where 
her own useless self had walked 
a thousand times. 

There — something. Here, the 
world she knew. She did not 
know the words “fairyland” or 
“magic place,” but if she had 
known them, she would have 
used them. 

She glanced to the right, to 
the left. 

The passerby noticed neither 
her nor the door. The sunset was 
just beginning to show in the 
upper city. In the lov/er city it 
was already blood-red with 
streamers of gold like enormous 
frozen flame. Elaine did not know 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



that she sniffed the air; she did 
not know that she trembled on 
the edge of tears; she did not 
know that a tender smile, the 
first smile in years, relaxed her 
mouth and turned her tired tense 
face into a passing loveliness. 
She was too intent on looking 
around. 

People walked about their 
business. Down the road, an 
underpeople type — female, pos- 
sibly cat — detoured far around 
a true human who was walking at 
a slower pace. Far away, a police 
ornithopter flapped slowly 
around one of the towers; unless 
the robots used a telescope on 
her or imless they had one of 
the rare hawk-undermen who 
were sometimes used as police, 
they could not see her. 

She stepped through the door- 
way and pulled the door itself 
back into the closed position. 

She did not know it, but there- 
with unborn futures reeled out 
of existence, rebellion flamed in- 
to coming centuries, people and 
underpeople died in strange 
causes, mothers changed the 
names of unborn Lords and star- 
ships whispered back from places 
which men had not even imagin- 
ed before. Spaces which had 
always been there, waiting for 
men’s notice, would come the 
sooner — because of her, because 
of the door, because of her next 
few steps, what she would say;

aiid the child she would meet. 
(The ballad-writers told the 
whole story later on, but they 
told it backwards, from their own 
knowledge of D’joan and what 
Elaine had done to set the worlds 
afire. The simple truth is the fact 
that a lonely woman went 
through a mysterious door. That 
is aU. Everything else happened 
later.) 

At the top of the steps she 
stood, door closed behind her, 
the sunset gold of the unknown 
city streaming out in front of her. 
She could see where the great 
shell of the New City of Kalma 
arched out toward the sky; she 
could see that the buildings here 
were older, less harmonious than 
the ones she had left. She did not 
know the concept “picturesque,” 
or she would have called it that. 
She knew no concept to describe 
the scene which lay peacefully at 
her feet. 

There was not a person in 
sight. 

Far in the distance, a fire- de- 
tector throbbed back and forth 
on top of an old tower. Outside 
of that there was nothing but the 
yellow-gold city beneath her, and 
a bird — was it a bird, or a large 
storm-swept leaf? — in the mid- 
dle distance. 

Filled with fear, hope, expecta- 
tion and the surmisal of strange 
appetites, she walked downward. 
With quiet, unknown purpose. 



\ t the foot of the stairs, nina 
flights of them there had 
been, a child waited — a girl, 
about five. The child had a bright 
blue smock, wavy red-brown 
hair, and the daintiest hands 
which Elaine had ever seen. 

Elaine’s heart went out to her. 
The child looked up at her and 
shrank away. Elaine knew the 
meaning of those handsome 
brown eyes, of that muscular sup- 
plication of trust, that recoil 
from people. It was not a child at 
all — just some animal in the 
shape of a person, a dog per- 
haps, which would later be taught 
to speak, to work to perform use- 
ful services. 

The little girl rose, standing 
as though she were about to run. 
Elaine had the feeling that the 
little dog-girl had not decided 
whether to run toward her or 
from her. She did not wish to get 
involved with an underperson — 
what woman would? — but 
neither did she wish to frighten 
the little thing. After all, it was 
small, very young. 

The two confronted each other 
for a moment, the little thing un- 
certain, Elaine relaxed. Then the 
little animal-girl spoke. 

“Ask her,” she said, and it 
was a command. 

Elaine was surprised. Since 
when did animals command? 



16 



GALAXY 



“Ask her!” repeated the little 
tiling. She pointed at a window 
which had the words TRAVEL- 
ERS’ AID above it. Then the girl 
ran. A flash of blue from her 
dress, a tv'inkle of white from 
her running sandals, and she was 
gone. 

Elaine stood quiet and puzzled 
in the forlorn and empty city. 

The window spoke to her, 
“You might as well come on over. 
You will, you know.” 

It was the wise mature voice 
of an experienced woman — a 
voice with a bubble of laughter 
underneath its phonic edge, with 
a hint of sympathy and en- 
thusiasm in its tone. The com- 
mand was not merely a com- 
mand. It was, even at its begin- 
ning, a happy private joke be- 
tween two wise women. 

Elaine was not surprised when 
a machine spoke to her. Record- 
ings had been telling her things 
all her life. She was not sure of 
this situation, however. 

“Is there somebody there?” 
she said. 

**Yes and no,” said the voice. 
“I’m ‘Travelers’ Aid’ and I help 
everybody who comes through 
this way. You’re lost or you 
wouldn’t be here. Put your hand 
in my window.” 

“What I mean is,” said Elaine, 
“are you a person or are you a 
machine?” 

“Depends,” said the voice. 



“I’m a machine, but I used to 
be a person, long, long ago. A 
lady, in fact, and one of the In- 
strumentality. But my time came 
and they said to me, ‘Would you 
mind if we made a machine print 
of your whole personality? It 
would be very helpful for the in- 
formation booths.” So of course 
I said yes, and they made this 
copy, and I died, and they shot 
my body into space with all the 
usual honors, but here I was. It 
felt pretty odd inside this con- 
traption, me looking at things 
and talking to people and giv- 
ing good advice and staying busy, 
until they built the new city. So 
what do you say? Am I me or 
aren’t I?” 

“I don’t know, ma’am.” Elaine 
stood back. 

The warm voice lost its humor 
and became commanding. “Give 
me your hand, then, so I can 
identify you and tell you what to 
do.” 

“I think,” said Elaine, “that 
I’ll just go back upstairs and go 
through the door into the upper 
city.” 

“And cheat me,” said the voice 
in the window, “out of my first 
conversation with a real person 
in four years?” There was de- 
mand in the voice, but there was 
still the warmth and the humor; 
there was loneliness too. The 
loneliness decided Elaine. She 
stepped up to the window and 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN

put her hand flat on the ledge. 

“You’re Elaine,” cried the win- 
dow. “You’re Elaine! The worlds 
wait for you. You’re from An- 
fang, where all things begin, the 
Peace Square at An-fang, on old 
Earth itself!” 

"Yes,” said Elaine. 

The voice bubbled over with 
enthusiasm. “He is waiting for 
you. Oh, he has waited for you a 
long, long time. And tlie little girl 
you met. That rras D’joan her- 
self. The story has begun. ‘The 
world’s great age begins a new.’ 
And I can die when it is over. 
So sorry, my dear. I don’t mean 
to confuse you. I am the lady 
Pane Ashash. You’re Elaine. 
Your number originally ended 
783 and you shoudn’t even be on 
this planet. All the important 
people here end with the num- 
bers 5 and 6. You’re a lay thera- 
pist and you’re in the wrong 
place, but your lover is already 
on his way, and you’ve never 
been in love yet, and it’s all too 
exciting.” 

Elaine looked quickly around 
her. The old lower town was 
turning more red and less gold 
as the sunset progresssed. The 
steps behind her seemed terribly 
high as she looked back, the door 
at the top very small. Perhaps 
it had locked on her when she 
closed it Maybe she wouldn’t 
ever be able to leave the old low- 
er city. 



T 'he window must have been 
watching her in some way, be- 
cause the voice of the lady 
Pane Ashash became tender. 

“Sit down my dear,” said the 
voice from the window. “When I 
was me, I used to be much more 
polite. I haven’t been me for a 
long, long time. I’m a machine, 
and still I feel like myself. Do 
sit down, and do forgive me.” 
Elaine looked around. There 
was the roadside marble bench 
behind her. She sat on it obedi- 
ently. The happiness which had 
been in her at the top of the 
steps bubbled forth anew. If this 
wise old machine knew so much 
about her. perhaps it could tell 
her what to do. What did the 
voice mean by “wrong planet”? 
By “lover”? By “he is coming 
for you now,” or was that what 
the voice had actually said? 

“Take a breath, my dear,” said 
the voice of the lady Pane Ash- 
ash. She might have been dead 
for hundreds or thousands of 
years, but she still spoke with 
the authority and kindness of a 
great lady 

Elaine breathed deep. She saw 
a huge red cloud, like a pregnant 
whale, getting ready to butt the 
rim of the upper city, far above 
her and far out over the sea. She 
wondered if clouds could pos- 
sibly have feelings. 

The voice was speaking again. 
What had it said? 



18 



GALAXY 



Apparently the question was 
repeated. “Did you know you 
were coming?” said the voice 
from the window. 

“Of course not.” Elaine shrug- 
ged. “There was just this door, 
and I didn’t have anything speci- 
al to do, so I opened it. And 
here was a whole new world in- 
side a house. It looked strange 
and rather pretty, so I came 
down. Wouldn’t you have done 
the same thing?” 

“I don’t know,” said the voice 
candidly. “I’m really a machine. 
I haven’t been me for a long, 
long time. Perhaps I would have, 
when I was alive. I don’t know 
that, but I know about things. 
Maybe I can see the future, or 
perhaps the machine part of me 
computes such good probabili- 
ties that it just seems like it. I 
know who you are and what is 
going to happen to you. You had 
better brush your hair.” 

“Whatever for?” said Elaine. 
“He is coming,” said the happy 
old voice of the lady Pane Ash- 
ash. 

“Who is coming?” said Elaine, 
almost irritably. 

“Do you have a mirror? I wish 
you would look at your hair. It 
could be prettier, not that it isn’t 
pretty right now. You want to 
look your best. Your lover; that’s 
who is coming, of course.” 

“I haven’t got a lover,” said 
Elaine. “I haven’t been authoriz- 



ed one, not till I’ve done some 
of my lifework, and I haven’t 
even found my lifework yet. I’m 
not the kind of girl who would 
go ask a Subchief for the dream- 
ies, not when I’m not entitled to 
the real thing. I may not be much 
of a person, but I have some 
self-respect.” Elaine got so mad 
that she shifted her position on 
the bench and sat with her face 
turned away from the all-watch- 
ing window. 

The next words gave her goose- 
flesh down her arms, they were 
uttered with such real earnest- 
ness, such driving sincerity. 
“Elaine, Elaine, do you really 
have no idea of who you are?” 

Elaine pivoted back on the 
bench so that she looked toward 
the window. Her face was caught 
redly but the rays of the setting 
sun. She could only gasp. 

“I don’t know what you 
mean . .” 

The inexorable voice went on. 
“Think, Elaine, think. Does the 
name ‘D’joan’ mean nothing to 
you?” 

“I suppose it’s an underperson, 
a dog. That’s what the D is for, 
isn’t it?” 

“That was the little girl you 
met,” said the lady Pane Ash- 
ash, as though the statement 
were something tremendous. 

“Yes,” said Elaine dutifully. 
She was a courteous woman, and 
never quarreled with strangers. 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN

“Wait a minute,” said the lady 
Pane Ashash, “I’m going to get 
my body out. God knows when 
I wore it last, but it’ll make you 
feel more at easy terms with me. 
Forgive the clothes. They’re old 
stuff, but I think the body will 
work all right. This is the begin- 
ning of the story of D’joan, and 
I want that hair of yours brushed 
even if I have to brush it myself. 
Just wait right there, girl, wait 
right there. I’ll just take a min- 
ute.” 

I'^he clouds were turning from 
dark red to liver-black. What 
could Elaine do? She stayed on 
the bench. She kicked her shoe 
against the walk. She jumped a 
little when the old-fashioned 
street lights of the lower city 
went on with sharp geometrical 
suddenness: they did not have 
the subtle shading of the newer 
lights in the other city upstairs, 
where day phased into the bright 
clear night with no sudden shift 
in color. 

The door beside the little win- 
dow creaked open. Ancient plas- 
tic crumbled to the walk. 

Elaine was astonished. 

Elaine knew she must have 
been unconsciously expecting a 
monster, but this was a charm- 
ing women of about her own 
height, wearing weird, old-fash- 
ioned clothes. The strange wo- 
man had glossy black hair, no 



evidence of recent or current ill- 
ness, no signs of severe lesion* 
in the past, no impairment evi- 
dent of sight, gait, reach or eye- 
sight. (There was no way she 
could check on smell or taste 
right off, but this was the medi- 
cal check-up she had had built in- 
to her from birth on — the check- 
list which she had run through 
with every adult person she had 
ever met. She had been designed 
as a “lay therapist, female” and 
she was a good one, even when 
there was no one at all to treat.) 

Truly, the body was a rich one. 
It must have cost the landing 
charges of forty or fifty planet- 
falls. The human shape was per- 
fectly rendered. The mouth mov- 
ed over genuine teeth; the words 
were formed by throat, palate, 
tongue, teeth and lips, and not 
just by a microphone mounted 
in the head. The body was real- 
ly a museum piece. It was prob- 
ably a copy of the lady Pane 
Ashash herself in time of life. 
When the face smiled, the ef- 
fect was indescribably winning. 
The lady wore the costume of a 
byegone age — a stately frontal 
dress of heavy blue material, em- 
broidered with a square pattern 
of gold at hem, waist and bodice. 
She had a matching cloak of 
dark, faded gold, embroidered in 
blue with the same pattern of 
squares. Her hair was upswept 
and set with jeweled combs. It 



20

seemed perfectly natural, but 
there was dust on one side of it. 

The robot smiled, “I’m out of 
date. It’s been a long time since 
I was me. But I thought, my 
dear, that you would find this old 
body easier to talk to than the 
window over there . .” 

Elaine nodded mutely. 

“You know this is not me?” 
said the body, sharply. 

Elaine shook her head. She 
didn’t know; she felt that she 
didn’t know anything at all. 

The lady Pane Ashash looked 
at her earnestly. “This is not me. 
It’s a robot body. You looked at 
it as though it were a real per- 
son. And I’m not me, either. It 
hurts sometimes. Did you know 
a machine could hurt? I can. 
But — I’m not me.” 

“Who are you?” said Elaine 
to the pretty old woman. 

“Before I died, I was the lady 
Pane Ashash. Just as I told you. 
Now I am a machine, and a part 
of your destiny. We will help 
each other to change the destiny 
of worlds, perhaps even to bring 
mankind back to humanity.” 
Elaine stared at her in be- 
wilderment. This was no com- 
mon robot. It seemed like a real 
person and spoke with such 
warm authority. And this thing, 
whatever it was, this thing seem- 
ed to know so much about her. 
Nobody else had ever cared. 
The nurse-mothers at the Child- 



house on earth had said, “Anoth- 
er witch-child, and pretty too, 
they’re not much trouble,” and 
had let her life go by. 

At last Elaine could face the 
face which was not really a face. 
The charm, the humor, the ex- 
pressiveness were still there. 

“What — what,” stammered 
Elaine, “do I do now?” 

“Nothing,” said the long-dead 
lady Pane Ashash, “except to 
meet your destiny.” 

“You mean my lover?” 

“So impatient!” laughed the 
dead woman’s record in a very 
human way. “Such a hurry. 
Lover first and destiny later. I 
was like that myself when I was 
a girl.” 

“But what do I do?” persisted 
Elaine. 

The night was now complete 
above them. The street lights 
glared on the empty and un- 
swept streets. A few doorways, 
not one of them less than a full 
street-crossing away, were il- 
luminated with rectangles of light 
or shadow — light if they were 
far from the street lights, so that 
their own interior lights shone 
brightly, shadow if they were so 
close under the big lights that 
they cut off the glare from over- 
head. 

“Go through this door,” said 
the old nice woman. 

But she pointed at the un- 
distinguished white of an unin- 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN

terrupted wall. There was no door 
■t all in that place. 

<tT>ut there’s no door there,” 
said Elaine. 

“If there were a door,” said 
the lady Pane Ashash, “you 
wouldn’t need me to tell you to 
go through it. And you do need 
me.” 

“Why?” said Elaine. 

“Because I’ve waited for you 
hundreds of years, that’s why.” 

“That’s no answer!” snapped 
Elaine. 

“It is so an answer,” smiled 
the woman, and her lack of 
hostility was not robot-like at all. 
It was the kindliness and com- 
posure of a mature human being. 
She looked up into Elaine’s eyes 
and spoke emphatically and 
softly. “I know because I do 
know. Not because I’m a dead 
person — that doesn’t matter any 
more — but because I am now 
a very old machine. You will go 
into the Brown and Yellow Cor- 
ridor and you will think of your 
lover, and you will do your work, 
and men will hunt you. But you 
will come out happily in the end. 
Do you understand this?” 

“No,” said Elaine, “no, I 
don’t.” But she reached out her 
hand to the sweet old woman. 
The lady took her hand. The 
tx>uch was warm and very 
human. 

“You don’t have to understand 



it. Just do it. And I know you 
will. So since you are going, go.” 
Elaine tried to smile at her, 
but she was troubled, more con- 
sciously worried than ever before 
in her life. Something real was 
happening to her, to her own in- 
dividual self, at a very long last. 
“How will I get through the 
door?” 

“I’ll open it,” smiled the lady, 
releasing Elaine’s hand, “and 
you’ll know your lover when he 
sings you the poem.” 

“Which poem?” said Elaine, 
stalling for time and frightened 
by a door which did not even 
exist. 

“It starts, ‘I knew you and 
loved you, and won you, in Rai- 
ma . .’ You’ll know it. Go on 
in. It’ll be bothersome at first, 
but when you meet the Hunter, 
it will all seem different.” 
“Have you ever been in there, 
yourself?” 

“Of course not,” said the dear 
old lady. “I’m a machine. That 
whole place is thoughtproof. No- 
body can see, hear, think or talk 
in or out of it. It’s a shelter left 
over from the ancient wars, when 
the slightest sign of a thought 
would have brought destruction 
on the whole place. That’s why 
the lord Englok built it, long be- 
fore my time. But you can go in. 
And you will. Here’s the door.” 
The old robot lady waited no 
longer. She gave Elaine a strange 



3a 



GALAXY 



friendly crooked smile, half 
proud and half apologetic. She 
took Elaine with firm fingertips 
holding Elaine’s left elbow. They 
walked a few steps down toward 
the wall. 

“Here, now,” said the lady 
Pane Ashash, and pushed. 

Elaine flinched as she was 
thrust toward the wall. Before 
she knew it, she was through. 
Smells hit her like a roar of bat- 
tle. The air was hot. The light 
was dim. It looked like a picture 
of the Pain Planet, hidden some- 
where in space. Poets later tried 
to describe Elaine at the door 
with a verse which begin. 

There were brown ones and blue ones 
And white ones and whiter. 

In the hidden and forbidden 
Downtown of Qown Town. 

There were horrid ones and horrider 
In the brown and yellow corridor. 

The truth was much simpler. 
Trained witch, born witch that 
she was, she perceived the truth 
immediately. All these people, 
all she could see, at least, were 
sick. They needed help. They 
needed herself. 

But the joke was on her, for 
she could not help a single one of 
them. Not one of them was a real 
person. They were just animals, 
things in the shape of man. Un- 
derpeople. Dirt. 

And she was conditioned to the 
bone never to help them. 

She did not know why the 



muscles of her legs made her 
walk forward, but they did. 

There are many pictures of 
that scene. 

The lady Pane Ashash, only a 
few moments in her past, seemed 
very remote. And the city of 
Raima itself, the new city, ten 
stories above her, almost seemed 
as though it had never existed at 
an. This, this was real. 

She stared at the underpeople. 

And this time, for the first time 
in her life, they stared right back 
at her. She had never seen any- 
thing like this before. 

They did not frighten her; they 
surprised her. The fright, Elaine 
felt, was to come later. Soon, per- 
haps, but not here, not now. 

IV 



Oomething which looked like a 
middle-aged woman walked 
right up to her and snapped at 
her. 

“Are you death?” 

Elaine stared. “Death? What 
do you mean? I’m Elaine.” 

“Be damned to that!” said the 
woman-thing. “Are you death?” 
Elaine did not know the word 
“damned” but she was pretty sure 
that “death,” even to these 
things, meant simply “termina- 
tion of life.” 

“Of course not,” said Elaine. 
“I’m just a person. A witch wo- 
man, ordinary people would call 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



23 



me. We don’t have anything to do 
with you underpeople. Nothing 
at all.” Elaine could see that the 
woman-thing had an enormous 
coiffure of soft brown sloppy hair, 
a sweat-reddened face and crook- 
ed teeth which showed when she 
grinned. 

“They all say that. They never 
know that they’re death. How do 
you think we die, if you people 
don’t send contaminated robots 
in with diseases? We all die off 
when you do that, and then some 
more underpeople find this place 
again later on and make a shelter 
of it and live in it for a few gen- 
erations until the death machines, 
things like you, come sweeping 
through the city and kill us off 
again. This is Clown Town, the 
underpeople place. Haven’t you 
heard of it?” 

Elaine tried to walk past the 
woman-thing, but she found her 
arm grabbed. This couldn’t have 
happened before, not in the his- 
tory of the world — an underper- 
son seizing a real person! 

“Let go!” she yelled. 

The woman-thing let her arm 
go and faced toward the others. 
Her voice had changed. It was 
no longer shrill and excited, but 
low and puzzled instead. “I can’t 
tell. Maybe it is a real person. 
Isn’t that a joke? Lost, in here 
with us. Or maybe she is death. 
I can’t tell. What do you think, 
Charley-is-my-darling?” 



The man she spoke to steppea 
forward. Elaine thought, in an- 
other time, in some other place, 
that underperson might pass for 
an attractive human being. His 
face was illuminated by intelli- 
gence and alertness. He looked di- 
rectly at Elaine as though he had 
never seen her before, which in- 
deed he had not, but he contin- 
ued looking with so sharp, so 
strange a stare that she became 
uneasy. His voice, when he spoke, 
was brisk, high, clear, friendly; 
set in this tragic place, it was the 
caricature of a voice, as though 
the animal had been program- 
med for speech from the habits 
of a human, persuader by profes- 
sion, whom one saw in the story- 
boxes telling people messages 
which were neither good nor im- 
portant, but merely clever. The 
handsomeness was itself deform- 
ity. Elaine wondered if he had 
come from goat stock. 

“Welcome, young lady,” said 
Charley - is - my - darling. “Now 
that you are here, how are you 
going to get out? If we turned 
her head around, Mabel,” said he 
to the underwoman who had first 
greeted Elaine, “turned it around 
eight or ten times, it would come 
off. Then we could live a few 
weeks or months longer before 
our lords and creators found us 
and put us all to death. What do 
you say, young lady? Should we 
kill you?”

“Kill? You mean, terminate 
life? You cannot. It is against the 
law. Even the Instrumentality 
does not have the right to do that 
without trial. You can’t. You’re 
just underpeople.” 

“But we will die,” said Char- 
ley-is-my-darling, flashing his 
quick intelligent smile, “if you go 
back out of that door. The police 
will read about the Brown and 
Yellow Corridor in your mind 
and they will flush us out with 
poison or they will spray disease 
in here so that we and our chil- 
dren will die.” 

Elaine stared at him. 

The passionate anger did not 
disturb his smile or his persuas- 
ive tones, but the muscles of his 
eye-sockets and forehead showed 
the terrible strain. The result was 
an expression which Elaine had 
never seen before, a sort of self- 
control reaching out beyond the 
lim.its of insanity. 

He stared back at her. 

She was not really afraid of 
him. Underpeople could not twist 
the heads of real persons; it was 
contrary to all regulations. 

A thought struck her. Perhaps 
regulations did not apply in a 
place like this, where illegal an- 
imals waited perpetually for sud- 
den deatii. The being which 
faced her was strong enough to 
turn her head around ten times 
clockwise or counter-clockwise. 
From her anatomy lessons, she 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



was pretty sure that the head 
would come off somewhere dur-i 
ing that process. She looked ai 
him with interest. Animal-typg 
fear had been conditioned out of 
her, but she had, she found, an 
extreme distaste for the termin-i 
ation of life under random cir- 
cumstances. Perhaps her “witch" 
training would help. She tried to 
pretend that he was in fact a 
man. The diagnosis “hyperten- 
sion : chronic aggression, now 

frustrated, leading to overstim- 
ulation and neurosis: poor nutri- 
tional record: hormone disorder 
probable” leapt into her mind. 

She tried to speak in a new 
voice. 

“I am smaller than you,” she 
said, “and you can ‘kill’ me just 
as well later as now. We might as 
well get acquainted. I’m Elaine, 
assigned here from Manhome 
Earth.” 

he effect was spectacular. 
Charley-is-my-darling step- 
ped back. Mabel’s mouth 
dropped open. The others gaped 
at her. One or two, more quick- 
witted than the rest, began whis- 
pering to their neighbors. 

At last Charley-is-my-darling 
spoke to her. “Welcome, my lady. 
Can I call you my lady? I guess 
not. Welcome, Elaine. We are 
your people. We will do what- 
ever you say. Of course you got 
in. The lady Pane Ashash sent

Va She has been telling us for 
h hundred years that somebody 
would come from Earth, a real 
person with an animal name, not 
a number, and that we should 
have a child named D’joan ready 
to take up the threads of destiny. 
Please, please sit down. Will you 
have a drink of water? We have 
no clean vessel here. We are all 
underpeople here and we have 
used everything in the place, so 
that it is contaminated for a real 
person.” A thought struck him. 
“Baby-baby, do you have a new 
cup in the kiln?” Apparently he 
saw someone nod, because he 
went right on talking. “Get it out 
then, for our guest, with tongs. 
New tongs. Do not touch it. Fill 
It with water from the top of the 
little waterfall. That way our 
guest can have an uncontamin- 
ated drink. A clean drink.” He 
beamed with a hospitality which 
was as ridiculous as it was gen- 
uine. 

Elaine did not have the heart 
to say she did not want a drink 
of water. 

She waited. They waited. 

By now, her eyes had become 
accustomed to the darkness. She 
could see that the main corridor 
was painted a yellow, faded and 
stained, and a contrasting light 
brown. She wondered what pos- 
sible human mind could have se- 
lected so ugly a combination. 
Cross-corridors seemed to open 



into it; at any rate, she saw il- 
luminated archways further down 
and people walking out of them 
briskly. No one can walk briskly 
and naturally out of a shallow al- 
cove, so she was pretty sure that 
the archways led to something. 

The underpeople, too, she 
could see. They looked very 
much like people. Here and there, 
individuals reverted to the an- 
imal type — a horse-man whose 
muzzle had regrown to its ances- 
tral size, a rat-woman with nor- 
mal human features except for 
nylon-like white whiskers, twelve 
or fourteen on each side of her 
face, reaching twenty centimeters 
to either side. One looked very 
much like a person indeed — a 
beautiful young woman seated 
on a bench some eight or ten 
meters down the corridor, and 
paying no attention to the crowd, 
to Mabel, to Charley-is-my-dar- 
ling or to herself. 

“Who is that?” said Elaine, 
pointing with a nod at the beau- 
tiful young woman. 

Mabel, relieved from the ten- 
sion wh’ch had seized her when 
she had asked if Elaine were 
“death,” babbled "with a sociabil- 
ity which was outre in this en- 
vironment. “That’s Crawlie.” 

“What does she do?” asked 
Elaine. 

“She has her pride,” said 
Mabel, her grotesque red face 
now jolly and eager, her slack

' mouth spraying spittle as she 
spoke. 

“But doesn’t she do any- 
thing?” said Elaine. 

Charley-is - my - darling inter- 
vened. “Nobody has to do any- 
thing here, lady Elaine — ” 

“It’s illegal to call me ‘lady,’ ” 
said Elaine. 

“I’m sorry, human being 
Elaine. Nobody has to do any- 
tfiing at all here. The whole 
bunch of us are completely il- 
legal. This corridor is a thought- 
shelter, so that no thoughts can 
escape or enter it. Wait a bit! 
Watch the ceiling . Now!” 

A red glow moved across the 
ceiling and was gone. 

“The ceiling glows,” said Char- 
ley-is - my - darling, “whenever 
anything thinks against it. The 
whole tunnel registers ‘sewage 
tank: organic waste’ to the out- 
side, so that dim perceptions of 
life which may escape here are 
not considered too unaccount- 
able. People built it for their own 
use. a million years ago.” 

“They weren’t here on Fomal- 
haut III a million years ago,” 
snapped Elaine. Why, she won- 
dered, did she snap at him? He 
wasn’t a person, just a talking 
animal who had missed being 
dropped down the nearest incin- 
erator. 

“I’m sorry, Elaine,” said Char- 
ley-is-my-darling. “I should 
have said, a long time ago. We 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



underpeople don’t get much 
chance to study real history. But 
we use this corridor. Somebody 
with a morbid sense of humor 
named this place Clown Town. 
We live along for ten or twenty 
or a hundred years, and then 
people or robots find us and kill 
us all. That’s why Mabel was up- 
set. She thought you were death 
for this time. But you’re not. 
You’re Elaine. That’s wonder- 
ful, wonderful.” His sly, too- 
clever face beamed with trans- 
parent sincerity. It must have 
been quite a shock to him to be 
honest. 

tC’^^ou were going to tell me 
^ what the undergirl is for,” 
said Elaine. 

“That’s Crawlie,” said he. “She 
doesn’t do anything. None of us 
really have to. We’re all doomed 
anyhow. She’s a little more hon- 
est than the rest of us. She has 
her pride. She scorns the rest of 
us. She puts us in our place. She 
makes everybody feel inferior. 
We think she is a valuable mem- 
ber of the group. We all have our 
pride, which is hopeless anyway, 
but Crawlie has her pride all by 
herself, without doing anything 
whatever about it. She sort of re- 
minds us. If we leave her alone, 
she leaves us alone.” 

Elaine thought. You’re funny 
things, so much like people, but 
so inexpert about it, as tiiough 



27 



you all had to “die” before you 
really learned what it is to be 
alive. Aloud, she could only say, 
“I never met anybody like that.” 

Crawlie must have sensed that 
they were talking about her, be- 
cause she looked at Elaine with 
a short quick stare of blazing 
hatred. Crawlie’s pretty face 
locked itself into a glare of con- 
centrated hostility and scorn; 
then her eyes wandered and 
Elaine felt that she, Elaine, no 
longer existed in the thing’s mind, 
except as a rebuke which had 
been administered and forgotten. 
She had never seen privacy as 
impenetrable as Crawlie’s. And 
yet the being, whatever she might 
have been made from, was very 
lovely in human terms. 

A fierce old hag, covered with 
mouse-gray fur, rushed up to 
Elaine. The mouse-woman was 
the Baby-baby who had been 
sent on the errand. She held a 
ceramic cup in a pair of long 
tongs. Water was in it. 

Elaine took the cup. 

Sixty to seventy underpeople, 
including the little girl in the blue 
dress whom she had seen out- 
side, watched her as she sipped. 
The water was good. She drank 
it all. There was a universal ex- 
halation, as though everyone in 
the corridor had waited for this 
moment Elaine started to put 
the cup down but the old mouse- 
woman was too quick for her. She 



took the cup from Elaine, stop- 
ping her in med-gesture and us- 
ing the tongs, so that the cup 
would not be contaminated by 
the touch of an underperson. 

“That’s right. Baby-baby,” 
said Charley-is-my-darling, “we 
can talk. It is our custom not to 
talk with a newcomer until we 
have offered our hospitality. Let 
me be frank. We may have to kill 
you, if this whole business turns 
out to be a mistake, but let me 
assure you that if I do kill you, 

I will do it nicely and without 
the least bit of malice. Right?” 

Elaine did not know what was 
so right about it, and said so. She 
visualized her head being twisted 
off. Apart from the pain and the 
degradation, it seemed so ter- 
ribly messy — to terminate life 
in a sewer with things which did 
not even have a right to exist. 

He gave her no chance to ar- 
gue, but went on explaining, 
“Suppose things turn out just 
right. Suppose that you are the 
Esther-Elaine-or-Eleanor that we 
have all been waiting for — the 
person who will do something to 
D’joan and bring us all help and 
deliverance — give us life, in 
short, real life — then what do 
we do?” 

“I don’t know where you get 
all these ideas about me. Why 
am I Esther-Elaine-or-Eleanor? 
What do I do to D’joan? Why 
me?”

C harley-is-my-darling stared at 
her as though he could not 
believe her question. Mabel 
frowned as though she could not 
think of the right words to put 
forth her opinions. Baby-baby, 
who had glided back to the group 
with swift mouselike suddenness, 
looked around as though she ex- 
pected someone from the rear to 
speak. She was right. Crawlie 
turned her face toward Elaine 
and said, with infinite condescen- 
sion: 

“I did not know that real 
people were ill-informed or 
stupid. You seem to be both. We 
have all our information from the 
lady Pane Ashash. Since she is 
dead, she has no prejudices 
against us underpeoole. Since 
she has not had much of any- 
thing to do, she has run through 
billions and billions of probabil- 
ities for us. All of us know what 
most probabilities come to — 
sudden death by disease or gas, 
or maybe being hauled off to the 
slaughterhouses in big police 
orinthopters. But the lady Pane 
Ashash found that perhaps a 
person with a name like yours 
would come, a human being with 
an oldname and not a number 
name, that that person would 
meet the Hunter, that she and the 
Hunter would teach the under- 
child D’joan a message and that 
the message would change the 
worlds. We have kept one child 



after another named D’joan, 
waiting for a hundred years. Now 
you show up. Maybe you are the 
one. You don’t look very com- 
petent to me. What are you good 
for?” 

“I’m a witch,” said Elaine. 

Crawlie could not keep the sur- 
prise from showing on her face. 
“A witch? Really?” 

“Yes,” said Elaine, rather hum- 
bly. 

“I wouldn’t be one,” said Craw- 
lie. “I have my pride.” She 
turned her face away and locked 
her features in their expression 
of perennial hurt and disdain. 

Charley-is - my - darling whis- 
pered to the group nearby, not 
caring whether Elaine heard his 
words or not, “That’s wonderful, 
wonderful. She is a v.-itch. A 
human witch. Perhaps the great 
day is here! Elaine,” said he hum- 
bly, “will you please look at us.” 

Elaine looked. When she 
stopped to think about where she 
was, it was incredible that the 
empty old lower city of Kalma 
should be just outside, just be- 
yond the wall, and the busy new 
city a mere thirty-five meters 
higher. This corridor was a world 
to itself. It felt like a world, with 
the ugly yellows and browns, the 
dim old lights, the stenches of 
man and animal mixed under in- 
tolerably bad ventilation. Baby- 
baby, Crawlie, Mabel and Char- 
ley-is-my-darling were part of

fhi s world. They were real; but 
they were outside, outside, so far 
as Elaine herself was concerned. 

“Let me go,” she said. “I’ll 
come back some day.” 

Charley - is - my - darling, who 
was so plainly the leader, spoke 
as if in a trance: “You don’t un- 
derstand, Elaine. The only ‘go- 
ing’ you are going to go is death. 
There is no other direction. We 
can’t let the old you go out of 
this door, not when the lady Pane 
Ashash has thrust you in to us. 
Either you go forward to your 
destiny, to our destiny too, either 
you do that, and all works out 
all right, so that you love us, and 
we love you,” he added dreamily, 
“or else I kill you with my own 



hands. Right here. Right now. I 
could give you another clean 
drink of water first. But that is 
all. There isn’t much choice for 
you, human being Elaine. What 
do you think would happen if 
you went outside?” 

“Nothing, I hope,” said Elaine. 

“Nothing!” snorted Mabel, her 
face regaining its original indig- 
nation. “The police would come 
flapping by in their ornithop- 
ter — ” 

“And they’d pick your brains,” 
said Baby-baby. 

“And they’d know about us,” 
said a tall pale man who had not 
spoken before. 

“And we,” said Crawlie from 
her chair, “would all of us die

within an hour or two at the 
longest. Would that matter to 
you, ma’am and Elaine?” 

“And,” added Charley-is-my- 
darling, “they would disconnect 
the lady Pane Ashash, so that 
even the recording of that dear 
dead lady would be gone at last, 
and there would be no mercy at 
all left upon this world.” 

“What is ‘mercy’?” asked 
Elaine. 

“It’s obvious you never heard 
of it,” said Crav/lie. 

The old mouse-hag Baby- 
baby came close to Elaine. She 
looked up at her and whispered 
through yellow teeth. “Don’t let 
them frighten you, girl. Death 
doesn’t matter all that much. 



not even to you true humana 
with your four hundred years oi 
to us animals with the slaughter- 
house around the corner. Death 
is a when, not a what. It’s the 
same for all of us. Don’t be 
scared. Go straight ahead and 
you may find mercy and love. 
They’re much richer than death, 
if you can only find them. Once 
you do find them, death won’t 
be very important.” 

“I still don’t know mercy,” said 
Elaine, “but I thought I knew 
what love was, and I don’t ex- 
pect to find my lover in a dirty 
old corridor full of underpeople.” 
“I don’t mean that kind of 
love,” laughed Baby-baby, brush- 
ing aside Mabel’s attempted in-

terruptioii with a wave of her 
hand-paw. The old mouse face 
was on fire with sheer expressive- 
ness. Elaine could suddenly im- 
agine what Baby-baby had 
looked like to a mouse-under- 
man when she was young and 
sleek and gray. Enthusiasm 
flushed the old features with 
youth as Baby-baby went on, “I 
don’t mean love for a lover, girl. 
I mean love for yourself. Love 
for life. Love for all things liv- 
ing. Love even for me. Your love 
for me. Can you imagine that?” 

E laine swam through fatigue 
but she tried to answer the 
question. She looked in the dim 
light at the wrinkled old mouse- 
hag with her filthy clothes and 
her little red eyes. The fleeting 
image of the beautiful young 
mouse-woman had faded away; 
there was only this cheap, use- 
less old thing, with her inhuman 
demands and her senseless plead- 
ing. Peoole never loved under- 
people. They used them, like 
chairs or doorhandles. Since when 
did a doorhandle demand the 
Charter of Ancient Rights? 

“No,” said Elaine calmly and 
evenly, "I can’t imagine ever lov- 
ing you.” 

“I knew it,” said Crawlie from 
her chair. There was triumph in 
the voice. 

Charley-is-my-darling shook 
his head as if to clear his sight. 

32 



“Don’t you even know who con- 
trols Fomalhaut III?” 

“The Instrumentality,” said 
Elaine. “But do we have to go on 
talking? Let me go or kill me or 
something. This doesn’t make 
sense. I was tired when I got here, 
and I’m a million years tireder 
now.” 

Mabel said, “Take her along.” 
“All right,” said Charley-is- 
my-darling. “Is the Hunter 
there?” 

The child D’joan spoke. She 
had stood at the back of the 
group. “He came in the other 
way when she came in the front.” 
Elaine said to Charley-is-my 
darling, “You lied to me. You 
said there was only one way.” 

“I did not lie,” said he. “There 
is only one way for you or me or 
for the friends of the lady Pane 
Ashash. The way you came. The 
other way is death.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“I mean,” he said, “that it 
leads straight into the slaughter- 
houses of the men you do not 
know. The Lords of the Instru- 
mentality who are here on Fom- 
alhaut III. There is the Lord 
Femtiosex, who is just and with- 
out pity. There is the Lord Lim- 
aono, who thinks that under- 
people are a potential danger 
and should not have been started 
in the first place. There is the 
Lady Goroke, who does not know 
how to pray, but who tries to

ponder the mystery of life and 
who has shown kindnesses to un- 
derpeople, as long as the kind- 
nesses were lawful ones. And 
there is the Lady Arabella Un- 
derwood, whose justice no man 
can understand. Nor underpeople 
eitlier,” he added with a chuckle. 

“Who is she? I mean, whfere 
did she get the funny name? It 
doesn’t have a number in it. It’s 
as bad as your names. Or my 
own,” said Elaine. 

“She’s from Old North Aus- 
tralia, the stroon world, on loan 
to the Instrumentality, and she 
follows the laws she was bom to. 
The Hunter can go through the 
rooms and the slaughterhouses of 
the Instrumentality, but could 
you? Could I?” 

“No,” said Elaine. 

“Then forward,” said Charley- 
is-my-darling, “to your death or 
to great wonders. May I lead the 
way, Elaine?” 

Elaine nodded wordlessly. 

The mouse-hag Baby-baby 
patted Elaine’s sleeve, her eyes 
alive with strange hope. As 
Elaine passed Crawlie’s chair, 
the proud, beautiful girl looked 
straight at her, expressionless, 
deadly and severe. The dog- girl 
D’joan followed the little proces- 
sion as if she had been invited. 

They walked down and down 
and down. Actually, it could not 
have been a full half-kilometer. 
But with the endless browns and 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



yellows, the strange shapes d 
the lawless and untended under- 
people, the stenches and the thick 
heavy air, Elaine felt as if she 
were leaving all known worlds 
behind. 

In fact, she was doing precise- 
ly that, but it did not occur to 
her that her own suspicion might 
be true. 

V 

A t the end of the corridor there 
was a round gate with a 
door of gold or brass. 

Charley-is-my-darling stopped. 

“I can’t go further,” he said. 
“You and D’joan will have to go 
on. This is the forgotten ante- 
chamber between the tunnel and 
the upper palace. The Hunter is 
there. Go on. You’re a person. It 
is safe. Underpeople usually die 
in there. Go on.” He nudged her 
elbow and pulled the sliding door 
apart. 

“But the little girl,” said 
Elaine. 

“She’s not a girl,” Charley-is- 
my-darling. “She’s just a dog — 
as I’m not a man, just a goat 
brightened and cut and trimmed 
to look like a man. If you come 
back, Elaine, I will love you like 
God or I will kill you. It de- 
pends.” 

“Depends on what?” asked 
Elaine. “And what is ‘God’?” 

Charley-is-my-darling smiled 

33 



the quick tricky smile which 
was wholly insincere and com- 
pletely friendly, both at the same 
time. It was probably the trade- 
mark of his personality in or- 
dinary times. “You’ll find out 
about God somewhere else, if you 
do. Not from us. And the de- 
pending is something you’ll know 
for yourself. You won’t have to 
wait for me to tell you. Go along 
now. The whole thing will be 
over in the next few minutes.’’ 

“But D’joan?” persisted Elaine. 

“If it doesn’t work,’’ said Char- 
ley-is-my-darling, “we can al- 
ways raise another D’joan and 
wait for another you. The lady 
Pane Ashash has promised us 
that. Go on in!’’ 

He pushed her roughly, so that 
she stumbled through. Bright 
light dazzled her and the clean 
air tasted as good as fresh water 
on her first day out of the space- 
ship pxid. 

The little dog-girl had trotted 
in beside her. 

The door, gold or brass, clang- 
ed to behind them. 

Elaine and D’joan stood still, 
side by side, looking forward and 
upward. 

There are many famous paint- 
ing of that scene. Most of the 
paintings show Elaine in rags with 
the distorted, suffering face of a 
witch. This is strictly unhistori- 
cal. She was wearing her every- 
day culottes, blouse and twin 



over-the-shoulder purses when 
she went in the other end of 
Clown Town. That was the usual 
dress on Fomalhaut III at that 
time. She had done nothing at 
all to spoil her clothes, so she 
must have looked the same when 
she came out. And D’joan — 
well, everyone knows what 
D’joan looked like. 

The Hunter met them. 

'^he Hunter met them, and 
new worlds began. 

He was a shortish man, with 
black curly hair, black eyes that 
danced with laughter, broad 
shoulders and long legs. He walk- 
ed with a quick sure step. He 
kept his hands quiet at his side, 
but the hands did not look tough 
and calloused, as though they 
had been terminating lives, even 
the lives of animals. 

“Come up and sit down,” he 
greeted them. “I’ve been wait- 
ing for you both.” 

Elaine stumbled upward and 
forward. “Waiting?” she gasped. 

“Nothing mysterious,” he said. 
“T had the viewscreen on. The 
one into the tunnel. Its connec- 
tions are shielded, so the police 
could not have peeped it.” 
Elaine stopped dead stiU. The 
little dog-girl, one step behind 
her, stopped too. She tried to 
draw herself up to her full 
he ght. She was about the same 
tallness that he was. It was dif-

ficult, since he stood four or five 
steps above them. She managed 
to keep her voice even when she 
said; 

“You know, then?” 

“What?” 

“All those thin.gs they said.” 
“Sure I know them,” he smil- 
ed. “Why not?” 

“But,” stammered Elaine, 
“about you and me being lovers? 
That too?” 

“That too,” he smiled again. 
“I’ve been hearing it half my 
life. Come on up, sit down and 
have something to eat. We have 
a lot of things to do tonight, if 
history is to be fulfilled through 
us. What do you eat, little girl?” 
said he kindly to D’joan. “Raw 
meat or people food?” 

“I’m a finished girl,” said 
D’joan, “so I prefer chocolate 
cake with vanilla ice cream.” 
“That you shall have,” said 
the Hunter. “Come, both of you, 
and sit down.” 

They had topped the steps. A 
luxurious table, already set, was 
waiting for them. There were 
three couches around it. Elaine 
looked for the third person who 
would join them. Only as she sat 
down did she realize that he 
meant to invite the dog-child. 

He saw her surprise, but did 
not comment on it directly. 
Instead, he spoke to D’joan. 
“You know me, girl, don’t 
you?” 



The child smiled and relaxed 
for the first time since Elaine had 
seen her. The dog-girl was really 
strikingly beautiful when the ten- 
sion went out of her. The war- 
iness, the quietness, the potential 
disquiet — these were dog quali- 
ties. Now the child seemed 
wholly human and mature far 
beyond her years. Her white face 
had dark, dark brown eyes. 

“I’ve seen you lots of times. 
Hunter. And you’ve told me what 
would happen if I turned out to 
be the D’joan. How I would 
spread the word and meet great 
trials. How I might die and might 
not, but people and underpeople 
would remember my name for 
thousands of years. You’ve told 
me almost everything I know — 
Except the things that I can’t 
talk to you about. You know 
them too, but you won’t talk, 
will you?” said the little girl im- 
ploringly. 

“I know you’ve been to 
Earth,” said the Hunter. 

“Don’t say it! Please don’t say 
it!” pleaded the girl. 

“Earth! Manhome itself?” 
cried Elaine. “How, by the stars, 
did you get there?” 

The Hunter intervened. “Don’t 
press her, Elaine. It’s a big sec- 
ret, and she wants to keep it. 
You’ll find out more tonight than 
mortal woman was ever told be- 
fore.” 

“What does ‘mortal’ mean?” 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN

asked Elaine, who disliked anti- 
que words. 

“It just means having a term- 
ination of life.” 

“That’s foolish,” said Elaine. 
“Everything terminates. Look at 
those poor messy people who 
went on beyond the legal four 
hundred years.” She looked 
around. Rich black-and-red cur- 
tains hung from ceiling to floor. 
On one side of the room there 
was a piece of furniture she had 
never seen before. It was like a 
table, but it had little broad flat 
doors on the front, reaching from 
side to side; it was richly orna- 
mented with unfamiliar woods 
and metals. Nevertheless, she 
had more important things to 
talk about than furniture. 

S he looked directly at the Hun- 
ter (no organic disease; 
wounded in left arm at an ear- 
lier period; somewhat excessive 
exposure to sunlight; might need 
correction for near vision) and 
demanded of him: 

“Am I captured by you, too?” 
“Captured?” 

“You’re a Hunter. You hunt 
things. To kill them, I suppose. 
That underman back there, the 
goat who calls himself Charley- 
is-my-darling — ” 

“He never does!” cried the dog- 
girl, D’joan, interrupting. 

“Never does what” said 
Elaine, cross at being interrupted. 

36 



“He never calls himself that. 
Other people, underpeople I 
mean, call him that. His name is 
Balthasar, but nobody uses it.” 
“What does it matter, little 
girl?” said Elaine. “I’m talking 
about my life. Your friend said 
he would take my life from me if 
something did not happen.” 
Neither D’joan nor the Hunter 
said anything. 

Elaine heard a frantic edge go 
into her voice, “You heard it!” 
She turned to the Hunter, “You 
saw it on the view screen.” 

The Hunter’s voice was sereni- 
ty and assurance: “We three 
have things to do before this 
night is out. We won’t get them 
done if you are frightened or 
worried. I know the underpeo- 
ple, but I know the Lords of the 
Instrumentality as well — all four 
of them, right here. The Lords 
Limaono and Femtiosex and the 
Lady Goroke. And the Norstilian, 
too. They will protect you. Char- 
ley-is-my-darling might want to 
take your life from you because 
he is worried, afraid that the 
tunnel of Englok, where you just 
were, will be discovered. I have 
ways of protecting him and your- 
self as well. Have confidence 
in me for a while. That’s not so 
hard, is it?” 

“But,” protested Elaine, “the 
man — or the goat — or what- 
ever he was, Charley-is-my- 
darling, he said it would all hap- 

GALAXY 



pen right away, as soon as I 
came up here with you.” 

“How can anything happen,” 
I said little D’joan, “if you keep 
j talking all the time?” 

The Hunter smiled. 

I “That’s right,” he said. “We’ve 
talked enough. Now we must be- 
come lovers.” 

Elaine jumped to her feet, “Not 
with me, you don’t. Not with her 
here. Not when I haven’t found 
my work to do. I’m a witch. 
I’m supposed to do something, 
but I’ve never really found out 
what it was.” 

“Look at this,” said the Hun- 
ter calmly, walking over to the 
wall, and pointing with his fin- 
ger at an intricate circular de- 
sign. 

Elaine and D’joan both looked 
at it. 

The Hunter spoke again, his 
voice urgent. “Do you see it, 
D’joan? Do you really see it? 
The ages turn, waiting for this 
moment, little child. Do you see 
it? Do you see yourself in it?” 

Elaine looked at the little dog- 
girl. D’joan had almost stopped 
breathing. She stared at the cur- 
ious symmetrical pattern as 
though it were a window into 
enchanting worlds. 

The Hunter roared, at the top 
of his voice, “D’joan! Joan! 
Joanie!” 

The child made no response. 

The Hunter stepped over to 

i THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



the child, slapped her gently on 
the cheek, shouted again. D’joan 
continued to stare at the intricate 
design. 

“Now,” said the Hunter, “you 
and I make love. The child is 
absent in a world of happy 
dreams. That design is a man- 
dala, something left over from 
the unimaginable past. It locks 
the human consciousness in 
place. D’joan will not see us or 
hear us. We cannot help her go 
toward her destiny unless you 
and I make love first.” 

Elaine, her hand to her mouth, 
tried to inventory symptoms as 
a means of keeping her familiar 
thoughts in balance. It did not 
work. A relaxation spread over 
her, a happiness and quiet that 
she had not once felt since her 
childhood. 

“Did you think,” said the Hun- 
ter, “that I hunted with my body 
and J.illed with my hands? Didn’t 
anyone ever tell you that the 
game comes to me rejoicing, that 
the animals die while they 
scream with pleasure? I’m a tele- 
path, and I work under license. 
And I have my license now from 
the dead lady Pane Ashash.” 

Elaine knew that they had 
come to the end of the talking. 
Trembling, happy, frightened, she 
fell into his arms and let him 
lead her over to the couch at 
the side of the black-and-gold 
room. 



37 



A thousand years later, she 
was kissing his ear and mur- 
muring loving words at him, 
words that she did not even re- 
alize she knew. She must, she 
thought, have picked up more 
from the story-boxes than she 
ever realized. 

“You’re my love,” she said, 
“my only one, my darling. Never, 
never leave me; never throw me 
away. Oh, Hunter, I love you 
so!” 

“We part” he said, “before to- 
morrow is gone, but shall meet 
again. Do you realize that all this 
has only been a little more than 
an hour?” 

Elaine blushed. “And I,” she 
stammered, “I — I’m hungry.” 
“Natural enough,” said the 
Hunter. “Pretty soon we can 
waken the little girl and eat to- 
gether. And then history will 
happen, unless somebody walks 
in and stops us.” 

“But, darling,” said Elaine, 
“can’t we go on — at least for 
a while? A year? A month? A 
day? Put the little girl back in 
the tunnel for a while.” 

“Not really,” said the Hunter, 
“but I’ll sing you the song that 
came into my mind about you 
and me. I’ve been thinking bits 
of it for a long time, but now it 
has really happened. Listen.” 

He held her two hands in his 
two hands, looked easily and 
frankly into her eyes. There was 



no hint in him of telepathic 
power. 

He sang to her the song which 
we know as I Love You and Lost 
You. 

1 knew you. and loved you, 
and won you, In Kalma. 

1 loved you, and won you, 
and lost you, my darling! 

The dark skies of Waterroclc 
swept down against us. 

Llghtnlng-lit only 
by our own love, my lovely! 

Our time was a short time, 
a sharp hour of glory — 

We tasted delight 
and we suffer denial. 

The tale of us two 
is a bittersweet story. 

Short as a shot 

but as long as death. 

We met and we loved, 
and vainly we plotted 

To rescue beauty 

from a smothering war. 

Time had no time for us, 
the minutes, no mercy. 

We have Ipved and lost, 
and the world goes on. 

We have lost and have kissed, 
and have parted, my darling! 

Ail that we have, 
we must save in our hearts, iove. 

The memory of beauty 
and the beauty of memory . 

I’ve loved you and won you 
and lost you, in Kalma. 

His fingers, moving in the air, 
produced a soft organ-like music 
in the room. She had noticed 
music-beams before, but she had 
never had one played for herself. 

By the time he was through 
singing, she was sobbing. It was 
all so true, so wonderful, so 
heartbreaking. 



38 



GALAXY 



He had kept her right hand in 
his left hand. Now he released 
her suddenly. He stood up. 

“Let’s work first Eat later. 
Someone is near us.” 

He walked briskly over to the 
little dog-girl, who was still seat- 
ed on the chair looking at the 
mandala with open, sleeping 
eyes. He took her head firmly 
and gently between his two hands 
and turned her eyes away from 
the design. She struggled mo- 
mentarily against his hands and 
then seemed to wake up fully. 

She smiled. “That was nice. 

I rested. How long was it — five 
minutes?” 

“More than that,” said 'the 
Hunter gently. “I want you to 
take Elaine’s hand.” 

A few hours ago, and Elaine 
would have protested at the 
grotesquerie of holding hands 
with an underperson. This time, 
she said nothing, but obeyed: 
she looked with much love 
toward the Hunter. 

“You two don’t have to know 
much,” said the Hunter. “You, 
D’joan, are going to get every- 
thing that is in our minds and in 
our memories. You will become 
us, both of us. Forevermore. You 
will meet your glorious fate.” 

The little girl shivered. “Is 
this really the day?” 

“It is,” said the Hunter. “Fu- 
ture ages will remember this 
night.” 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



“And you, Elaine,” said he to 
her, “have nothing to do but to 
love me and to stand very stiH. 
Do you understand? You will se« 
tremendous things, some of them 
frightening. But they won’t be 
real. Just stand still.” 

Elaine nodded wordlessly. 

“In the name,” said the Hun- 
ter, “of the First Forgotten One, 
in the name of the Second For- 
gotten One, in the name of the 
Third Forgotten One. For the 
love of people, that will give 
them life. For the love that will 
give them a clean death and 
true . .” His words were clear 
but Elaine could not understand 
them. 

The day of days was here. 

She knew it. 

She did not know how she 
knew it, but she did. 

The lady Pane Ashash crawled 
up through the solid floor, wear- 
ing her friendly robot body. She 
came near to Elaine and mur- 
mured : 

“Have no fear, no fear.” 

Fear? thought Elaine. This is 
no time for fear. It is much too 
interesting. 

A s if to answer Elaine, a clear, 
strong, masculine voice spoke 
out of nowhere ; 

This is the time for the daring 
sharing. 

When these words were spoken, 
it was as if a bubble had been 



39 



pricked. Elaine felt her personali- 
ty and D’joan mingling. With 
ordinary telepathy, it would have 
been frightening. But this was 
not communication. It was being. 

She had become Joan. Sh^ felt 
the clean little body in its tidy 
clothes. She became aware of 
the girl-shape again. It was oddly 
pleasant and familiar, in terribly 
faraway kinds of feeling, to re- 
member that she had had that 
shape once — the smooth, inno- 
cent flat chest; the uncompli- 
cated groin; the fingers which 
still felt as though they were 
separate and alive in extending 
from the palm of the hand. But 
the mind — that child’s mind! 
It was like an enormous museum 
illuminated by rich stained-glass 
windows, cluttered with variega- 
ted heaps of beauty and treasure, 
scented by strange incense which 
moved slowly in unpropelled air. 
D’joan had a mind which reached 
all the way back to the color 
and glory of man’s antiquity. 
D’joan had been a Lord of the 
Instrumentality, a monkey-man 
riding the ships of space, a friend 
of the dear dead lady Pane Ash- 
ash, and Pane Ashash herself. 

No wonder the child was rich 
and strange: she had been made 
the heir of all the ages. 

This is the time for the glar- 
ing top of the truth at the wear- 
ing sharing, said the nameless, 
clear, loud voice in her mind. 



This is the time for you and him. 

Elaine realized that she was 
responding to hypnotic sugges- 
tions which the Lady Pane Ash- 
ash had put into the mind of the 
little dog-girl — suggestions 
which were triggered into full po- 
tency the moment that the three 
of them came into telepathic con- 
tact. 

For a fraction of a second, she 
perceived notliing but astonish- 
ment within herself. She saw 
nothing but herself — every de- 
tail, every secrecy, every thought 
and feeling and contour of flesh. 
She was curiously aware of how 
her breasts hung from her chest, 
the tension of her belly-muscles 
holding her female backbone 
straight and erect — 

Female backbone? 

Why had she thought that she 
had a female backbone? 

And then she knew. 

She was following the Hun- 
ter’s mind as his awareness rush- 
ed through her body, drank it up, 
enjoyed it, loved it all over again, 
this time from the inside out. 

She knew somehow that the 
little dog-girl watched every- 
thing quietly, wordlessly, drink- 
ing in from them both the full 
nuance of being truly human. 

Even with the delirium, she 
sensed embarrassment. It might 
be a dream, but it was still too 
much. She began to close her 
mind and the thought had come 



40 



GALAXY 



to her that she should take her 
hands away from the hands of 
Hunter and the dog-child. 

But then fire came . 

VI 

F ire came up from the floor, 
burning about them intangi- 
bly. Elaine felt nothing . but 
she could sense the touch of the 
little girl’s hand. 

Flames around the dames, 
games, said an idiot voice from 
nowhere. 

Fire around the pyre, sire, said 
another. 

Hot is what we got, tot, said a 
third. 

Suddenly Elaine remembered 
Earth, but it was not the Earth 
she knew. She was herself 
D’joan, and not D’joan. She was 
a tall, strong monkey-man, in- 
distinguishable from a true 
human being. She/he had tre- 
mendous alertness in her/his 
heart as he/she walked across 
the Peace Square at An-fang, 
the Old Square at An-fang, where 
all things begin. She/he noticed 
a discrepency. Some of the build- 
ings were not there. 

The real Elaine thought to her- 
self, “So that’s what they did 
with the child — printed her with 
the memories of other underpeo- 
ple. Other ones, who dared things 
and went places.” 

The fire stopped. 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



Elaine saw the black-and-gold 
room clean and untroubled for a 
moment before the green white- 
topped ocean rushed in. The 
water poured over the three of 
them without getting them wet 
in the least. The greenness wash- 
ed around them without pressure, 
without suffocation. 

Elaine was the Hunter. Enor- 
mous dragons floated in the sky 
above Fomalhaut III. She felt 
herself wandering across a hill, 
singing with love and yearning. 
She had the Hunter’s own mind, 
his own memory. The dragon 
sensed him, and flew down. The 
enormous reptilian wings were 
more beautiful than a sunset, 
more delicate than orchids. Their 
beat in the air was as gentle as 
the breath of a baby. She was 
not only Hunter but dragon too; 
she felt the minds meeting and 
the dragon d5ring in bliss, in joy. 

Somehow the water was gone. 
So too were D’joan and the Hun- 
ter. She was not in the room. 
She was taut, tired, worried 
Elaine, looking down a nameless 
street for hop>eless destinations. 
She had to do things which could 
never be done. The wrong me, 
the wrong time, the wrong place 
— and I’m alone, I’m alone, I’m 
alone, her mind screamed. The 
room was back again ; so too were 
the hands of tiie Hunter and the 
little girl. 

Mist began rising — 



41 



Another I'ream? thought 
Elaine. Aren't we done? 

But there was another voice 
somewhere, a voice which grat- 
ed like the rasp of a saw cutting 
through bone, like the grind of a 
broken machine still working at 
ruinous top speed. It was an evil 
voice, a terror-filling voice. 

Perhaps this really was the 
“death” which the tunnel under- 
people had mistaken her for. 

The Hunter’s hand released 
hers. She let go of D’joan. 

There was a strange woman in 
the room. She wore the baldric 
of authority and the leotards of 
a traveler. 

Elaine stared at her. 

tt''^ou’ll be punished,” said 
* the terrible voice, which 
now was coming out of the wo- 
man. 

“Wh — wh — what?” stam- 
mered Elaine. 

“You’re conditioning an under- 
person without authority. I don’t 
know who you are, but the Hun- 
ter should know better. The ani- 
mal will have to die, of course,” 
said the woman, looking at little 
D’joan. 

Hunter muttered, half in greet- 
ing to the stranger, half in ex- 
planation to Elaine, as though he 
did not know what else to say: 

“Lady Arabella Underwood.” 

Elaine could not bow to her, 
though she wanted to. 



The surprise came from the lit- 
tle dog girl. 

I am youT sister Joan, she said, 
and no animal to you. | 

The lady Arabella seemed to 
have trouble hearing. (Elaine 1 
herself could not tell whether I 
she was hearing spoken words or 
taking the message with her 
mind.) 

I am Joan and I love you. 

The lady Arabella shook her- 
self as though water had splash- ’ 
ed on her. “Of course you’re 
Joan. You love me. And I love 
you.” . 

People and underpeople meet 
on the terms of love. 

“Love. Love, of course. You’re 1 
a good little girl. And so right.” 
You will forget me, said Joan, 
until we meet and love again. 

“Yes, darling. Good-by for ^ 

now.” i 

At last D’joan did use words. | 

She spoke to the Hunter and 
Elaine, saying, “It is finished. I 
know who I am and what I must , 
do. Elaine had better come with 
me. We will see you soon. Hun- 
ter — if we live.” 

Elaine looked at the Lady 

Arabella who stood stock still, 
staring like a blind women. The 
Hunter nodded at Elaine with 
his wise, kind, rueful smile. 

The little girl led Elaine down, 
down, down to the door which led 
back to the tunnel of Englok. 
Just as they went through the 



47 



GALAXY 



brass door, Elaine heard the voice 
of the Lady Arabella say to the 
Hunter : 

“What are you doing here all 
by yourself? The room smells 
funny. Have you had animals 
here? Have you killed some- 
thing?” 

“Yes, ma’am,” said the Hun- 
ter as D’joan and Elaine step- 
ped through the door. 

“What?” cried the Lady Ara- 
bella. 

Hunter must have raised his 
voice to a point of penetrating 
emphasis because he wanted the 
other two to hear him, too: 

“I have killed, ma’am,” he 
said, “as always — with love. 
This time it was a system.” 

They slipped through the door 
while the Lady Arabella’s pro- 
testing voice, heavy with authori- 
ty and inquiry, was still sweeping 
against the Hunter. 

Joan led. Her body was the 
body of a pretty child, but her 
personality was the full awaken- 
ing of all the underpeople who 
had been imprinted on her. Elaine 
could not understand it, because 
Joan was still the little dog-girl, 
but Joan was now also Elaine, 
also Hunter. There was no doubt 
about their movement; the child, 
no longer an undergirl, led the 
way and Elaine, human or not, 
followed. 

The door closed behind them. 
They were back in the brown- 



and-yellow corridor. Most of the 
underpeople were awaiting them. 
Dozens stared at them. The 
heavy animal -human smells (rf 
the old tunnel rolled against 
them like thick, slow waves. 
Elaine felt the beginning of a 
headache at her temples, but she 
was much too alert to care. 

For a moment, D’joan and 
Elaine confronted the underpeo- 
ple. 

TV/Tost of you have seen paint- 
ings or theatricals based 
upon this scene. The most famous 
of all is, beyond doubt, the fan- 
tastic “one-line drawing” of San 
Shigonanda — the board of the 
background almost uniformly 
gray, with a hint of brown and 
yellow on the left, a hint of black 
and red on the right, and in the 
center the strange white line, al- 
most a smear of paint, which 
somehow suggests the bewildered 
girl Elaine and the doom-blessed 
child Joan. 

Charley-is-my-darling was, of 
course, the first to find his voice. 
(Elaine did not notice him as a 
goat-man any more. He seemed 
an earnest, friendly man of mid- 
dle age, fighting poor health and 
an uncertain life with great cour- 
age. She now found his smile per- 
suasive and charming. Why, 
thought Elaine, didn’t I see him 
that way before? Have I chang- 
ed?) 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



43 



Charley - ’s - my - darling had 
spoken before Elaine found her 
wits. “He did it. Are you 
D’joan?” 

“Am I D'jcan?” said the child, 
asking the crowd of deformed, 
weird people in the tunnel. “Do 
you think I am D’joan?” 

“No! No! You are the lady 
who was promised — you are the 
bridge-to-man,” cried a tall yel- 
low-haired old woman, whom 
Elaine could not remember see- 
ing before. The woman flung her- 
self to her knees in front of the 
child, and tried to get D’joan’s 
hand. The child held her hands 
away, quietly, but firmly, so the 
woman buried her face in the 
child’s skirt and wept. 

“I am Joan,” said the child, , 
“and I am dog no more. You are 
people now, people, and if you 
die with me, you will die 
men. Isn’t that better than 
it has ever been before? And you, 
Ruthia,” said she to the woman 
at her feet, “stand up and stop 
crying. Be glad. These are the 
days that I shall be with you. I 
know your children were all taken 
away and killed, Ruthie, and I 
am sorry. I cannot bring them 
back. But I give you woman- 
hood. I have even made a per- 
son out of Elaine.” 

“Who are you?” said Charley- 
xs-my-darling. “Who are you?” 
“I’m the little girl you put out 
to live or died an hour ago. But 

44 



now I am Joan, not D’joan, and 
I bring you a weapon. You are 
women. You are men. You are 
people. You can use the weapon.” 
‘What weapon?” The voice 
was Crawlie’s, from about the 
third row of spectators. 

“Life and life-with,” said the 
child Joan. 

“Don’t be a fool,” said Craw- 
lie. “What’s the weapon? Don’t 
give us words. We’ve had words 
and death ever since the world 
of undefpeople began. That’s 
what people give us — good 
words, fine principles and cold 
murder,, year after year, genera- 
tion after generation. Don’t tell 
me I’m a person — I’m not. I’m 
a bi.son and I know it. An animal 
fixed up to look like a person. 
Give me a something to kill with. 
Let me die fighting.” 

Little Joan looked incongruous 
in her young body and Short sta- 
ture, still wearing the little blue 
smock in which Elaine had first 
seen her. She commanded the 
rpom. She lifted her hand and the 
buzz of low voices, which had 
started while Crawlie was yell- 
ing, dropped off to silence again. 

“Crawlie,” she said, in a voice 
that carried all the way down the 
hall, “peace be with you in the 
everlasting now.” 

Crawlie scowled. She did have 
the grace to look puzzled at 
Joan’s message to her, but she 
did not speak. 



GALAXY 




“Don’t talk to me, dear peo- 
ple,” said little Joan. “Get used 
to me first. I bring you life-with. 
It’s more than love. Love’s a 
hard, sad, dirty word, a cold 
word, an old word. It says too 
much and it promises too little. 
I bring you something much big- 
ger than love. If you’re alive, 
you’re alive. If you’re alive-with, 
then you know the other life is 
there too — both of you, any of 
you, all of you. Don’t do any- 
thing. Don’t grab, don’t clench, 
don’t possess. Just be. That’s the 
weapon. There’s not a flame or a 
gun or a poison that can stop it.” 

“I want to believe you,” said 
Mable, “but I don’t know how 
to.” 

“Don’t believe me,” said little 
Joan. “Just wait and let things 
happen. Let me through, good 
people. I have to sleep for a 
while. Elaine wiU watch me while 
I sleep and when I get up, I will 
tell you why you are underpeople 
no longer.” 

Joan started to move for- 
ward — 

A wild ululating screech split 
the corridor. 



T^veryone looked around to see 
where it came from. 

It was almost like the shriek 
of a fighting bird, but the sound 
came from among them. 

Elaine saw it first. 

Crawlie had a knife and just 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



as the cry ended, she flung her- 
self on Joan. 

Child and woman fell on the 
floor, their dresses a tangle. The 
large hand rose up twice with the 
knife, and the second time it 
came up red. 

From the hot shocking burn in 
her side, Elaine knew that she 
must herself have taken' one of 
the stabs. She could not tell 
whether Joan was still living. 

The undermen pulled Crawlie 
off the child. 

Crawlie was white with rage, 
“Words, words, words. She’ll kill 
us all with her words.” 

A large, fat man with the 
muzzle of a bear on the front of 
an otherwise human-looking head 
and body, stepped around the 
man who held Crawlie. He gave 
her one tremendous slap. She 
dropped to the floor unconscious. 
The knife, stained with blood, 
fell on the old worn carpet. 
(Elaine thought automatically : 
restorative for her later; check 
neck vertebrae; no problem of 
bleeding.) 

For the first time in her life, 
Elaine functioned as a wholly ef- 
ficient witch. She helped the 
people pull the clothing from 
little Joan. The tiny body, with 
the heavy purple-dark blood 
pumping out from just below the 
rib-cage, looked hurt and fragile. 
Elaine reached in her left hand- 
bag. She had a surgical radar 

46 



pen. She held it to her eye and 
looked through the flesh, up and 
down the wound. The peritoneum 
was punctured, the liver cut, the 
upper folds of the large intestine 
v/ere perforated in two places. 
When she saw this, she knew 
what to do. She brushed the by- 
standers aside and got to work. 

First she glued up the cuts from 
the inside out, starting with the 
damage to the liver. Each touch 
of the organic adhesive was pre- 
ceded by a tiny spray of re-cod- 
ing powder, designed to reinforce 
the capacity of the injured organ 
to restore itself. The probing, 
pressing, squeezing, took eleven 
minutes. Before it was finished, 
Joan had awakened, and was 
murmuring ; 

“Am I dying?” 

“Not at all,” said Elaine, “un- 
less these human medicines 
poison your dog blood.” 

“Who did it?” 

“Crawlie.” 

“Why?” said the child. “Why? 
Is she hurt too? Where is she?” 

“Not as hurt as she is going to 
be,” said the goat-man, Charley- 
is-my-darling. “If she lives, we’ll 
fix her up and try her and put 
her to death.” 

“No, you won’t,” said Joan. 
“You’re going to love her. You 
must.” 

The goat-man looked bewild- 
ered. 

He turned in his perplexity to 
GALAXY 



Elaine. “Better have a look at 
Crawlie,” said he. “Maybe Or- 
son killed her with that slap. He’s 
a bear, you know.” 

“So I saw,” said Elaine, drily. 
What did the man think that 
thing looked like, a humming- 
bird? 

She walked over to the body 
of Crawlie. As soon as she 
touched the shoulders, she knew 
that she was in for trouble. The 
outer appearances were human, 
but the musculature beneath was 
not. She suspected that the lab- 
oratories had left Crawlie ter- 
ribly strong, keeping the buffalo 
strength and obstinacy for some 
remote industrial reason of their 
own. She took out a brainlink, a 
close-range telepathic hookup 
which worked only briefly and 
slightly, to see if the mind still 
functioned. As she reached for 
Crawlie’s head to attach it, the 
unconscious girl sprang suddenly 
to life, jumped to her feet and 
said: 

“No, you don’t! you don’t peep 
me, you dirty human!” 

“Crawlie, stand still.” 

“Don’t boss me, you monster!” 
“Crawlie, that’s a bad thing to 
say.” It was eerie to hear such a 
commanding voice coming from 
the throat and mouth of a small 
child. Small she might have been, 
but Joan commanded the scene. 

“I don’t care what I say. You 
all hate me.” 



“That’s not true, Crawlie.” 

“You’re a dog and now you’re 
a person. You’re born a traitor. 
Dogs have always sided with 
people. You hated me even be- 
fore you went into that room and 
changed into something else. 
Now you are going to kill us all.” 

“We may die, Crawlie, but I 
won’t do it.” 

“Well, you hate me, anyhow. 
You’ve always hated me.” 

“You may not believe it,” said 
Joan, “but I’ve always loved you. 
You were the prettiest woman in 
our whole corridor.” 

^rawlie laughed. The sound 
'^'gave Elaine gooseflesh. “Sup- 
pose I believed it. How could I 
live if I thought that people lov- 
ed me? If I believed you, I would 
have to tear myself to pieces, to 
break my brains on the wall, to 
do — ” The laughter changed to 
sobs, but Crawlie managed to 
resume talking: “You things are 
so stupid that you don’t even 
know that you’re monsters. 
You’re not people. You never 
will be people. I’m one of you 
myself. I’m honest enough to ad- 
mit what I am. We’re dirt, we’re 
nothing, we’re things that are 
less than machines. We hide in 
the earth like dirt and when 
people kill us they do not weep. 
At least we were hiding. Now 
you come along, you and your 
tame human woman — ” Crawlie 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



47 



glared briefly at Elaine — “and 
you try to change even that. I’ll 
kill you again if I can, you dirt, 
you slut, you dog! What are you 
doing with that child’s body? We 
don’t even know who you are 
now. Can you tell us?” 

The bear-man had moved up 
close to Crawlie, unnoticed by 
her, and was ready to slap her 
down again if she moved against 
little Joan. 

Joan looked straight at him 
and with a mere movement of her 
eyes she commanded him not to 
strike. 

“I’m tired,” she said, “I’m 
tired, Crawlie. I’m a thousand 
years old when I am not even 
five. And I am Elaine now, and 
I am Hunter too, and I am the 
Lady Pane Ashash, and I know 
a great many more things that I 
thought I would ever know. I 
have work to do, Crawlie, be- 
cause I love you, and I think I 
will die soon. But please, good 
people, first let me rest.” 

The bear-man was on Crawlie’s 
right. On her left, there had 
moved up a snake-woman. The 
face was pretty and human, ex- 
cept for the thin forked tongue 
which ran in and out of the 
mouth like a dying flame. She 
had good shoulders and hips but 
no breasts at all. She wore empty 
golden brassiere cups which 
swung against her chest. Her 
hands looked as though they 



might be stronger than stedL 
Crawlie started to move toward 
Joan, and the snake-woman 
hissed. 

It was the snake hiss of Old 
Earth. 

For a second, every animal- 
person in the corridor stopped 
breathing. They all stared at the 
snake-woman. She hissed again, 
looking straight at Crawlie. The 
sound was an abomination in 
that narrow space. Elaine saw 
that Joan tightened up like a 
little dog, Charley-is-my-darling 
looked as though he was ready to 
leap twenty meters in one jump, 
and Elaine herself felt an im- 
pulse to strike, to kill, to destroy. 
The hiss was a challenge to them 
all. 

The snake-woman looked 
around calmly, fully aware of 
the attention she had obtained. 

“Don’t worry, dear people. 
See, I’m using Joan’s name for 
aU of us. I’m not going to hurt 
Crawlie, not unless she hurts 
Joan. But if she hurts Joan, if 
anybody hurts Joan, they will 
have me to deal with. You have 
a good idea who I am. We S- 
people have great strength, high 
intelligence and no fear at all. 
You know we cannot breed. 
People have to make us one by 
one, out of ordinary snakes. Do 
not cross me, dear people. I 
want to learn about this new 
love which Joan is bringing, and 



48 



GALAXY 



nobody is going to hurt Joan 
vdiile I am here. Do you hear me, 
people? Nobody. Try it, and you 
die. I think I could kill almost 
all of you before I died, even if 
you all attacked me at once. Do 
you hear me, people? Leave Joan 
alone. That goes for you, too, 
you soft human woman. I am not 
afraid of you either. You there,” 
said she to the bear-man, “pick 
little Joan up and carry her to a 
quiet bed. She must rest. She 
must be quiet for a while. You be 
quiet too, all you people, or you 
will meet me. Me.” Her black 
eyes roved across their faces. The 
snake-woman moved forward 
and they parted in front of her, 
as though she were the only solid 
being in a throng of ghosts. 

Her eyes rested a moment on 
Elaine. Elaine met the gaze, but 
it was an uncomfortable thing to 
do. The black eyes with neither 
eyebrow nor lashes seemed full 
of intelligence and devoid of 
emotion. Orson, the bear-man, 
followed obediently behind. He 
carried little Joan. 

As the child passed Elaine she 
tried to stay awake. She mur- 
mured, “Make me bigger. Please 
make me bigger. Right away.” 

“I don’t know how , . .” said 
Elaine. 

The child struggled to full 
awakening. “I’ll have work to do. 
Work . and maybe my deatii 
to die. It will all be wasted if I 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



am this little. Make me bigger.**’ 

“But — ” protested Elaine 
again. 

“If you don’t know, ask the 
lady.” 

“What lady?” 

The S-woman had paused, lis- 
tening to the conversation. She 
cut in. 

“The Lady Pane Ashash, of 
course. The dead one. Do you 
think that a living Lady of the 
Instrumentality would do any- 
thing but kill us all?” 

A s the snake-woman and Or- 
son carried Joan away, 
Charley-is-my-darling came up 
to Elaine and said, “Do you want 
to go?” 

“Where?” 

“To the Lady Pane Ashash, of 
course.” 

“Me?” said Elaine. “Now?” 
said Elaine, even more emphat- 
ically. “Of course not,” said 
Elaine, pronouncing each word as 
though it were a law. “What do 
you think I am? A few hours 
ago I did not even know that you 
existed. I wasn’t sure about the 
word ‘death.’ I just assumed that 
everything terminated at four 
hundred years, the way it should. 
It’s been hours of danger, and 
everybody has been threatening 
everybody else for all that time. 
I’m tired and I’m sleepy and I’m 
dirty, and I’ve got to take care 
of myself, and besides — ” 



49 



She stopped suddenly and bit 
her lip. She had started to say, 
and besides, my body is all worn 
out with that dream-like love- 
making which the Hunter and I 
had together. That was not the 
business of Charley-is-my-dar- 
ling: he was goat enough as he 
was. His mind was goatish and 
would not see the dignity of it all. 

The goat-man said, very gent- 
ly, “You are making history, 
Elaine, and when you make his- 
tory you cannot always take care 
of all the little things too. Are you 
happier and more important than 
you ever were before? Yes? 
Aren’t you a different you from 
the person who met Balthasar 
just a few hours ago?” 

Elaine was taken aback by the 
seriousness. She nodded. 

“Stay hungry and tired. Stay 
dirty. Just a little longer. Time 
must not be wasted. You can talk 
to the Lady Pane Ashash. Find 
out what we must do about little 
Joan. When you come back with 
further instructions, I will take 
care of you myself. This tunnel 
is not as bad a town as it looks. 
We will have everything you 
could need, in the Room of Eng- 
lok. Englok himself built it, long 
ago. Work just a little longer, and 
then you can eat and rest. We 
have everything here. T am the 
citizen of no mean city.’ But first 
you must help Joan. You love 
Joan, don’t you?” 



“Oh, yes, I do,” she said. 

“Then help us just a little bit 
more.” 

With death? she thought. With 
murder? With violation of law? 
But — but it was all for Joan. 

It was thus that Elaine went 
to the camouflaged door, went 
out under the open sky again, 
saw the great Saucer of Upper 
Kalma reaching out over the Old 
Lower City. She talked to the 
voice of the Lady Pane Ashash, 
and obtained certain instructions, 
together with other messages. 
Later, she was able to repeat 
them, but she was too tired to 
make out their real sense. 

She staggered back to the 
place in the wall where she 
thought the door to be, leaned 
against it, and nothing happened. 

“Further down, Elaine, further 
down. Hurry! When I used to be 
me, I too got tired,” came the 
strong whisper of the Lady Pane 
Ashash, “but do hurry!” 

Elaine stepped away from the 
wall, looking at it. 

A beam of light struck her. 

The Instrumentality had found 
her. 

Ohe rushed wildly at the wall. 
^ The door gaped briefly. The 
strong welcome hand of Charley- 
is my-darling helped her in. 

“The light! The light!” cried 
Elaine. “I’ve killed us all. They 
saw me.” 



GALAXY 



“Not yet,” smiled the goat- 
man, with his quick crooked in- 
telligent smile. “I may not be 
educated, but I am pretty smart.” 

He reached toward the inner 
gate, glanced back at Elaine ap- 
praisingly, and then shoved a 
man-sized robot through the 
door. 

“There it goes, a sweeper about 
your size. No memory bank. A 
worn-out brain. Just simple mot- 
ivations. If they come down to 
see what they thought they saw, 
they will see this instead. We 
keep a bunch of these at the 
door. We don’t go out much, but 
when we do, it’s handy to have 
these to cover up with.” 

He took her by the arm. 
“While you eat, you can tell me. 
Can we make her bigger . .?” 

“Who?” 

“Joan, of course. Our Joan. 
That’s what you went to find out 
for us.” 

Elaine had to inventory her 
own mind to see what the Lady 
Pane Ashash had said on that 
subject. In a moment she re- 
membered. 

“You need a pod. And a jelly 
bath. And narcotics, because it 
will hurt. Four hours.” 

“Wonderful,” said Charley-is- 
my-darling, leading her deeper 
and deeper into the tunnel. 

“But what’s the use of it,” said 
Elaine, “if I’ve ruined us all? The 
Instrumentality saw me coming ^ 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLO.VVN TOWN 



in. They will follow. They will 
kill all of you, even Joan. Where 
is the Hunter? Shouldn’t I sleep 
first?” She felt her lips go thick 
with fatigue: she had not rested 
or eaten since she took that 
chance on the strange little door 
between Waterrocky Road and 
the Shopping Bar. 

“You’re safe, Elaine, you’re 
safe,” said Charley-is-my-dar- 
ling, his sly smile very warm and 
his smooth voice carrying the 
ring of sincere conviction. For 
himself, he did not believe a word 
of it. He thought they were all in 
danger, but there was no point 
in terrifying Elaine. Elaine was 
the only real person on their side, 
except for the Hunter, who was 
a strange one, almost like an an- 
imal himself, and for the Lady 
Pane Ashash, who was very be- 
nign, but who was, after all, a 
dead person. He was frightened 
himself, but he was afraid of fear. 
Perhaps they were all doomed. 

In a way, he was right. 

VII 

^ I 'ae Lady Arabella Underwood 
had called the Lady Goroke. 

“Something has tampered with 
my mind.” 

The Lady Goroke felt very 
shocked. She threw back the in- 
quiry. Put a probe on it. 

“I did. Nothing.” 

Nothing? 



51 



More shock for the Lady Gor- 
oke, Sound the alert, then. 

“Oh, no. Oh, no, no. It was a 
friendly, nice tampering.” The 
Lady Arabella Underwood, be- 
ing an Old North Australian, was 
rather formal : she always thought 
full words at her friends, even in 
telepathic contact. She never sent 
mere raw ideas. 

But that’s utterly unlawful. 
You’re part of the Instrumental- 
ity. It’s a crime! thought the 
Lady Goroke. 

She got a giggle for reply. 

You laugh . .? she inquired. 

“I just thought a new Lord 
might be here. From the Instru- 
mentality. Having a look at me.” 

The Lady Goroke was very 
proper and easily shocked. We 
wouldn’t do that! 

The Lady Arabella thought to 
herself but did not transmit, 
“Not to you, my dear. You’re a 
blooming prude.” To the other 
she transmitted, “Forget it 
then.” 

Puzzled and worried, the Lady 
Goroke thought: Well, all right. 
Break? 

“Right-ho. Break.” 

The Lady Goroke frowned to 
herself. She slapped her wall. 
Planet Central, she thought at it. 

A mere man sat at a desk. 

“I am the lady Goroke,” she 
said. 

“Of course, my lady,” he re- 
plied. 

52 



“Police fever, one degree. One 
degree only. Till rescinded. 
Clear?” 

“Clear, my lady. The entire 
planet?” 

“Yes,” she said. 

“Do you wish to give a rea- 
son?” his voice was respectful 
and routine. 

“Must I?” 

“Of course not, my lady.” 

“None given, then. Close.” 

He saluted and his image fad- 
ed from the wall. 

She raised her mind to the 
level of a light clear call. Instru- 
mentality Only — Instrumental- 
ity Only. I have raised the Police 
fev- level 1° by command. Rea- 
son, personal disquiet. You know 
my voice. You know me. Goroke. 

Far across the city — a police 
ornithopter flapped slowly down 
the street. 

The police robot was photog- 
raphing a sweeper, the most elab- 
orately malfunctioning sweeper 
he had ever seen. 

The sweeper raced down the 
road at unlawful speeds, ap- 
proaching three hundred kilom- 
eters an hour, stopped with a 
sizzle of plastic on stone, and be- 
gan picking dust-motes off the 
pavement. 

When the ornithopter reached 
it, the sweeper took off again, 
rounded two or three corners at 
tremendous speed and then set- 
tled down to its idiot job. 



GALAXY 



The third time this happened, 
the robot in the ornithopter put 
a disabling slug through it, flew 
down and picked it up with the 
claws of his machine. 

He saw it in close view. 

“Birdbrain. Old model. Bird- 
brain. Good they don’t use those 
any more. The thing could have 
hurt A Man. Now, I’m printed 
from a mouse, a real mouse with 
lots and lots of brains.” 

He flew toward the central 
junkyard with the worn-out 
sweeper. The sweeper, crippled 
but still conscious, was trying to 
pick dust off the iron claws which 
held it. 

Below them, the Old City 
twisted out of sight with its odd 
geometrical lights. The new city, 
bathed in its soft perpetual glow, 
shone out against the night of 
Fomalhaut III. Beyond them, 
the everlasting ocean boiled in its 
private storms. 

/^n the actual stage the actors 
cannot do much with the 
scene of the interlude, where 
Joan was cooked in a single night 
from the size of a child five years 
old to the tallness of a miss fif- 
teen or sixteen. The biological 
machine did work well, though 
at the risk of her life. It made 
her into a vital, robust young per- 
son, without changing her mind 
at all. This is hard for any ac- 
tress to portray. The storyboxes 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



have the advantage. They can 
show the machine with all sorts 
of improvements — flashing 
lights, bits of lightnight, myster- 
ious rays. Actually, it looked 
like a bathtub full of boiling 
brown jelly, completely covering 
Joan. 

Elaine, meanwhile, ate hun- 
grily in the palatial room of Eng- 
lok himself. The food was very, 
very old, and she had doubts, as 
a witch, about its nutritional val- 
ue, but it stilled her hunger. The 
denizens of Clown Town had de- 
clared this room “off limits” to 
themselves, for reasons which 
Charley-is-my-darling could not 
make plain. He stood in the 
doorway and told her what to do 
to find food, to activate the bed 
out of the floor, to open the bath- 
room. Everything was very old- 
fashioned and nothing responded 
to a simple thought or to a mere 
slap. 

A curious thing happened. 

Elaine had washed her hands, 
had eaten and was preparing for 
her bath. She had taken most of 
her clothes off, thinking only 
that Charley-is-my-darling was 
an animal, not a man, so that it 
did not matter. 

Suddenly she knew it did mat- 
ter. 

He might be an imderperson 
but he was a man to her. Blush- 
ing deeply all the way down to 
her neck, she ran into the bath- 

53 



IlDoin and called back to him: 
“Go away. I will bathe and 
ttien sleep. Wake me when you 
have to. not before.” 

“Yes, Elaine.” 

“And — and — ” 

“Yes?” 

“Thank you,” she said. “Thank 
you very much. Do you know, I 
never said ‘thank you’ to an un- 
derperson before.” 

“That’s all right,” said Char- 
ley-is-my-darling with a smile. 
“Most real people don’t. Sleep 
well, my dear Elaine. When you 
awaken, be ready for great things. 
We shall take a star out of the 
skies and shall sets thousands of 
worlds on fire . .” 

“What’s that?” she said, put- 
ting her head around the comer 
of the bathroom. 

“Just a figure of speech,” he 
smiled. “Just meaning that you 
won’t have much time. Rest well. 
Don’t forget to put your clothes 
in the ladysmaid machine. The 
ones in Clown Town are all worn 
out. But since we haven’t used 
this room, yours ought to work.” 
“Which is it?” she said. 

“The red lid with the gold 
handle. Just lift it.” On that dom- 
estic note he left her to rest, 
while he went off and plotted the 
destiny of a hundred billion lives. 

T hey told her it was mid-morn- 
ing when she came out of 
tiie room of Englok. How could 

54 



she have known it? The brown- 
and-yellow corridor, with its 
gloomy old yellow lights, was just 
as dim and stench-ridden as ever. 

The people all seemed to have 
changed. 

Baby-baby was no longer a 
mouse-hag, but a woman of con- 
siderable force and much tender- 
ness. Crawlie was as dangerous 
as a human enemy, staring at 
Elaine, her beautiful face gone 
bland with hidden hate. Charley- 
is-my-darling was gay, friendly 
and persuasive. She thought she 
could read expressions on the 
faces of Orson and the S’woman, 
odd though their features were. 

After she had gotten through 
some singularly polite greetings, 
she demanded, “What’s happen- 
ing now?” 

A new voice spoke up — a 
voice she knew and did not know. 

Elaine glanced over at a niche 
in the wall. 

The Lady Pane Ashash! And 
who was that with her? 

Even as she asked herself the 
question, Elaine knew the an- 
swer. It was Joan, grown, only 
half a head less tall than the 
Lady Pane Ashash or herself. It 
was a new Joan, powerful, happy, 
and quiet; but it was all the dear 
little old D’joan too. 

“Welcome,” said the lady Pane 
Ashash, “to our revolution.” 

“What’s a revolution?” asked 
^aine. “And I thought you 



GALAXY 



’"couldn’t come in here with all 
the thought shielding?” 

The Lady Pane Ashash lifted 
a wire which trailed back from 
her robot body, “I rigged this up 
so that I could use the body. 
Precautions are no use any more. 
It’s the other side which will need 
the precautions now. A revolution 
is a way of changing systems and 
people. This is one. You go first, 
Elaine. This way.” 

“To die? Is that what you 
mean?” 

The lady Pane Ashash 
laughed warmly. “You know me 
by now. You know my friends 
here. You know what your own 
life has been down to now, a 
useless witch in a world which 
did not want you. We may die, 
but it’s what we do before we 
die that counts. This is Joan go- 
ing to meet her destiny. You lead 
as far as the Upper City. Then 
Joan will lead. And then we shall 
see. 

“You mean, all these people 
are going too?” Joan looked at 
the ranks of the underpeople, who 
were beginning to form into two 
queues down the corridor. The 
queues bulged wherever moth- 
ers led their children by the hand 
or carried small ones in their 
arms. Here and there the line 
was punctuated by a giant under- 
person. 

They have been nothing, 
thought Elaine, and I was noth- 



ing too. Now we are all going to 
do something, even though we 
may be terminated for it. “May 
be” thought she: “shall be” is 
the word. But it is worth it if 
Joan can change the worlds, even 
a little bit, even for other 
people. 

Joan spoke up. Her voice had 
grown with her body, but it was 
the same dear voice which the 
little dog-girl had had sixteen 
hours (they seem sixteen years, 
thought Elaine) ago, when Elaine 
first met her at the door to the 
tunnel of Englok. 

Joan said, “Love is not some- 
thing special, reserved for men 
alone. 

“Love is not proud. Love has 
no real name. Love is for life 
itself, and we have life. 

“We cannot win by fighting. 
People outnumber us, outgun us, 
outrun us, outfight us. But people 
did not create us. Whatever made 
people, made us too. You all 
know that, but will we say the 
name?” 

There was a murmur of no and 
never from the crowd. 

“You have waited for me. I 
have waited too. It is time to die, 
perhaps, but we will die the way 
people did in the beginning, be- 
fore things became easy and 
cruel for them. They live in a 
stupor and they die in a dream. 
It is not a good dream and if they 
awaken, they will know that we 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



55 



are people too. Are you with 
me?” They murmured yes. “Do 
you love me?” Again they mur- 
mured agreement. “Shall we go 
out and meet the day?” They 
shouted their acclaim. 

Joan turned to the Lady Pane 
Ashash. “Is everything as you 
wished and ordered?” 

“Yes,” said the dear dead wom- 
an in the robot body. “Joan 
first, to lead you. Elaine preced- 
ing her, to drive away robots or 
ordinary underpeople. When you 
meet real people, you will love 
them. That is all. You will love 
them. If they kill you, you will 
love them. Joan will show you 
how. Pay no further attention to 
me. Ready?” 

Joan lifted her right hand and 
said words to herself. The people 
bowed their heads before her, 
faces and muzzles and snouts of 
all sizes and colors. A baby of 
some kind mewed in a tiny fal- 
setto to the rear. 

Just before she turned to lead 
the procession, Joan turned back 
to the people and said, “Crawlie, 
where are you?” 

“Here, in the middle,” said a 
clear, calm voice far back. 

“Do you love me now, Craw- 
lie?” 

“No, D’joan. I like you less 
than when you were a little dog. 
But these are my people too, as 
well as yours. I am brave. I can 
walk. I won’t make trouble.” 



“Crawlie,” said Joan, “will you 
love people if we meet them?” 

A 11 faces turned toward the 
beautiful bison-girl. Elaine 
could just see her, way down the 
murky corridor. Elaine could see 
that the girl’s face had turned 
utter, dead white with emotion. 
Whether rage or fear, she could 
not tell. 

At last Crav/lie spoke, “No, I 
won’t love people. And I won’t 
love you. 1 have my pride.” 
Softly, softly, like death itself 
at a quiet bedside, Joan spoke. 
“You can stay behind, Crawlie. 
You can stay here. It isn’t much 
of a chance, but it's a chance.” 
Crawlie looked at her, “Bad 
luck to you, dog-woman, and bad 
luck to the rotten human being 
up there beside you.” 

Elaine stood on tiptoe to see 
what would happen. Crawlie’s 
face suddenly disappeared, drop- 
ping downward. 

The snake woman elbowed her 
way to the front, stood close to 
Joan where the others could see 
her, and sang out in a voice as 
clear as metal itself: 

“Sing ‘poor, poor, Crawlie,’ 
dear people. Sing ‘I love Craw- 
lie,’ dear people. She is dead. I 
just killed her so that we would 
all be full of love. I love you 
too,” said the S’woman, on whose 
reptilian features no sign of love 
or hate could be seen.

GALAXY 



Joan spoke up, apparently 
prompted by the lady Pane Ash- 
ash. “We do love Crawlie, dear 
people. Think of her and then 
let us move forward.” 

Charley-is - my - darling gave 
Elaine a little shove. “Here, you 
lead.” 

In a dream, in a bewilderment, 
Elaine led. 

She felt warm, happy, brave 
when she passed close to the 
strange Joan, so tall and yet so 
familiar. Joan gave her a full 
smile and whispered, “Tell me 
I’m doing well, human woman. 
I’m a dog and dogs have lived a 
million years for the praise of 
man.” 

“You’re right, Joan, you’re 
completely right! I’m with you. 
Shall I go now?” responded 
Elaine. 

Joan nodded, her eyes brim- 
ming with tears. 

Elaine led. 

Joan and the Lady Pane Ash- 
ash followed, dog and dead wom- 
an championing the procession. 

The rest of the underpeople 
followed them in turn, in a 
double line. 

When they made the secret 
door open, daylight flooded the 
corridor. Elaine could almost feel 
the stale odor-ridden air pouring 
out with them. When she glanced 
back into the tunnel for the last 
time, she saw the body of Craw- 
lie lying all alone on the floor. 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



Elaine herself turned to the 
steps and began going up them. 

No one had yet noticed the 
procession. 

Elaine could hear the wire of 
the Lady Pane Ashash dragging 
on the stone and metal of the 
steps as they climbed. 

When she reached the top door, 
Elaine had a moment of indecis- 
ion and panic. “This is my life, 
my life,” she thought. “I have no 
other. 'What have I done? Oh, 
Hunter, Hunter, where are you? 
Have you betrayed me?” 

Said Joan softly behind her, 
“Go on! Go on. This is a war of 
love. Keep going.” 

Elaine opened the door to the 
upper street. The roadway was 
full of people. Three police or- 
nithopters flapped slowly over- 
head. This was an unusual num- 
ber. Elaine stopped again. 

“Keep walking,” said Joan, 
“and warn the robots off.” 
Elaine advanced and the revo- 
lution began. 

VIII 

'^he revolution lasted six min- 
utes and covered one him- 
dred and twelve meters. 

The police flew over as soon 
as the underpeople began pour- 
ing out of the doorway. 

The first one glided in like a 
big bird, his voice asking, “Iden- 
tify! Who are you?” 



57 



Elaine said, ‘‘Gro away. That is 
a command.” 

“Identify yourself,” said the 
bird-like machine, banking steep- 
ly with the lens-eyed robot peer- 
ing at Elaine out of its middle. 

“Go away,” said Elaine. “I am 
a true human and I command.” 
The first police omithopter 
apparently called tn the others 
by radio. Together they flapped 
their way down the corridor be- 
tween the big buildings. 

A lot of people had stopped. 
Most of their faces were blank, 
a few showing animation or 
amusement or horror at the sight 
of so many underpeople all 
crowded in one place. 

Joan’s voice sang out, in the 
clearest possible enunciation of 
the Old Common Tongue: 

“Dear people, we are people. 
We love you. We love you.” 

The underpeople began to 
chant lov«, love, love in a weird 
plainsong full of sharps and half- 
tones. The true humans shrank 
back. Joan herself set the ex- 
ample by embracing a young 
woman of about her own height 
Charley-is-my-darling took a hu- 
man man by the shoulders and 
shouted at him: 

“I love you, my dear fellow! 
Believe me, I do love you. It’s 
wonderful meeting you.” The hu- 
man man was startled by the 
contact and even more startled 
by the glowing warmth of the 



goat-man’s voice. He stood 
mouth slack and body relaxed 
with sheer, utter and accepted 
surprise. 

Somewhere to the rear a per- 
son screamed. 

A police omithopter came flap- 
ping back. Elaine could not tell 
if it was one of the three she had 
sent away, or a new one altogeth- i 
er. She waited for it to get close | 
enough to hail, so that she could 
tell it to go away. For the first 
time, she wondered about the 
actual physical character of dan- 
ger. Could the police machine | 
put a slug through her? Or shoot | 
flame at her? Or lift her scream- 
ing, carrying her away with its 
iron claws to some place where 
she would be pretty and clean j 
and never herself again? “Oh, 
Hunter, Hunter, where are you 
now? Have you forgotten me? I 
Have you betrayed me?” i 

The underpeople were still 
surging forward and mingling 
with with the real people, clutch- i 
ing them by their hands or their j 
garments and repeating in the ] 
queer medley of voices: 

“I love you. Oh, please, I love 
you! We are people. We are your 
sisters and brothers ...” 

The snake-woman wasn’t mak- 
ing much progress. She had seized 
a human man with her more- 
than-iron hand. Elaine hadn’t 
seen her saying anything, but the 
man had fainted dead away. The 



58 



GALAXY 



•nake woman had him draped 
over her arm like an empty over- 
coat and was looking for some- 
body else to love. 

Behind Elaine a low voice said, 
“He’s coming soon.” 

“Who?” said Elaine to the 
Lady Pane Ashash, knowing per- 
fectly well whom she meant, but 
not wanting to admit it, and busy 
with watching the circling orni- 
thopter at the same time. 

“The Hunter, of course,” said 
the robot with the dear dead 
lady’s voice. “He’ll come for you. 
You’ll be all right. I’m at the 
end of my wire. Look away, my 
dear. They are about to kill me 
again and I am afraid that the 
sight would distress you.” 

Fourteen robots, foot models, 
marched with military decision 
into the crowd. The true humans 
took heart from this and some of 
them began to slip away into 
doorways. Most of the real peo- 
ple were still so surprised that 
they stood around with the un- 
derpeople pawing at them, bab- 
bling the accents of love over and 
over again, the animal origin of 
their voices showing plainly. 

The robot sergeant took no 
note of this. He approached the 
Lady Pane Ashash only to find 
Elaine standing in his way. 

“I command you,” she said, 
with all the passion of a working 
witch, “I command you to leave 
this place.” 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



His eye-lenses were like dark- 
blue marbles floating in milk. 
They seemed swimmy and poor- 
ly-focused as he looked her over. 
He did not reply but stepped 
around her, faster than her own 
body could intercept him. He 
made for the dear, dead Lady 
Pane Ashash. 

Elaine, bewildered, realized 
that the Lady’s robot body seem- 
ed more human than ever. The 
robot-sergeant confronted her. 

This is the scene which we all 
remember, the first authentic pic- 
ture tape of the entire incident: 

The gold and black sergeant, 
his milky eyes staring at the 
Lady Pane Ashash. 

The Lady herself, in the pleas- 
ant old robot body, lifting a com- 
manding hand. 

Elaine, distraught, half-turning 
as though she would grab the 
robot by his right arm. Her head 
is moving so rapidly that her 
black hair swings as she turns. 

Charley-is-my-darling shout- 
ing, “I love, love, love!” at a 
small handsome man with mouse- 
colored hair. The man is gulp- 
ing and saying nothing. 

All this we know. 

Then comes the unbelievable, 
which we now believe, the event 
for which the stars and skylanes 
were unprepared. 

Mutiny. 

Robot mutiny. 

Disobedience in t^en daylight. 

59 



T he words are hard to hear on 
the tape, but we can still 
make them out. The recording 
device on the police ornithopter 
had gotten a square fix on the 
face of the Lady Pane Ashash. 
Lip-readers can see the words 
plainly; non-lip-readers can hear 
the words the third or fourth 
time the tape is run tl. rough the 
eyebox. 

Said the Lady, “Overridden.” 
Said the sergeant, “No, you’re 
a robot.” 

“See for yourself. Read my 
brain. I am a robot. I am also a 
woman. You cannot disobey peo- 
ple. I am people. I love you. 
Furthermore, you are people. 
You think. We love each other. 
Try. Try to attack.” 

“I — I cannot,” said the robot 
sergeant, his milky eyes seeming 
to spin with excitement. “You 
love me? You mean I’m alive? I 
exist?” 

“With love, you do,” said the 
Lady Pane Ashash. “Look at 
her,” said the Lady, pointing to 
Joan, “because she has brought 
you love.” 

The robot looked and disobey- 
ed the law. His squad looked 
with him. 

He turned back to the Lady 
and bowed to her: “Then you 
know what we must do, if we 
cannot obey you and cannot dis- 
obey the others.” 

“Do it,” she said sadly, “but 



know what you are doing. You 
are not really escaping two 
human commands. You are mak- 
ing a choice. You. That makes 
you men.” 

The sergeant turned to his 
squad of man-sized robots: “You 
hear that? She says we are men. 
I believe her. Do you believe 
her?” 

“We do,” they cried almost 
unanimously. 

This is where the picture-tape 
ends, but we can imagine how 
the scene was concluded. Elaine 
had stopped short, just behind 
the sergeant-robot. The other 
robots had come up behind her. 
Charley-is-my-darling had stop- 
ped talking. Joan was in the act 
of lifting her hands in blessing, 
her warm brown dog eyes gone 
wide with pity and understand- 
ing. 

People wrote down the things 
that we cannot see. 

Apparently the robot-sergeant 
said, “Our love, dear people, and 
good-by. We disobey and die.” 
He waved his hand to Joan. It is 
not certain whether he did or did 
not say, “Good-by, our lady and 
our liberator.” Maybe some 
poet made up the second saying: 
the first one, we are sure about. 
And we are sure about the next 
word, the one which historians 
and poets all agree on. He turn- 
ed to his men and said, 

“Destruct.” 



60 



GALAXY 




Fourteen robots, the black- 
and-gold sergeant a.nd his thir- 
teen silver-blue foot soldiers, sud- 
denly spurted white fire in the 
street of Kalma. They detonated 
their suicide buttons, th.c-rmlte 
caps in their own heads. They 
had done something with no !iu- 
rnan command at all, on an or- 
der from another robot, the body 
of the Lady Pane Ashash, and 
she in turn had no human au- 
thority, but merely the word of 
the little dog-girl Joan, who had 
been made an adult in a single 

night. 

Fourteen white flames made 
people and underpeople turn 
their eyes aside. Into the light 
there dropped a special police 
ornithopter. Out of it came the 
two Ladies, Arabella Underwood 
and Goroke. They lifted their 
forearms to shield their eyes 
from the blazing dying robots. 
They did not see the Hunter, 
who had moved mysteriously in- 
to an open window above the 
street and who watched the scene 
by putting his hands over his 
eyes and peeking through the 
slits between his fingers. While 
the people still stood blinded, 
they felt the fierce telepathic 
shock of the mind of the Lady 
Goroke taking command of the 
situation. That was her right, as 
a Chief of the Instrumentality. 
Some of the people, but not all 
of them, felt the outre counter- 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN

abock of Joan’s mind reaching 
out to meet the Lady Goroke. 

“I command,” thought the 
Lady Goroke, her mind kept 
open to all beings. 

“Indeed you do, but I love, I 
love you,” thought Joan. 

The first-order forces met. 
They engaged. 

The revolution was over. Noth- 
ing had really happened, but 
Joan had forced people to meet 
her. This was notliing like the 
poem about people and under- 
people getting all mixed up. The 
mixup came much later, even af- 
ter the time of C’mell. The poem 
is pretty, but is it dead wrong, as 
you can see for yourself : 

You should ask me. 

Me. me, me, 

Because I know — 

I used to live 
On the Eastern Shore. 

Men aren’t men. 

And women aren’t women, 

And people aren’t people any more. 

There is no Eastern Shore on 
Fomalhaut III anyhow; the peo- 
ple/underpeople crisis came much 
later than this. The revolution 
had failed, but history had reach- 
ed its new turning-point, the 
quarrel of the two Ladies. They 
left their' minds open out of sheer 
surprise. Suicidal robots and 
world-loving dogs were unheard- 
of. It was bad enough to have il- 
legal underpeople on the prowl, 
but these new things — ah I 



■pxestroy them all, said the Lady 
Goroke. 

“Why?” thought the Lady Ara- 
bella Underwood. 

Malfunction, replied Goroke. 

“But they’re not machines!” 

Then they’re animals — un- 
derpeople. Destroy! Destroy! 

Then came the answer which 
has created our own time. It 
came from the Lady Arabella 
Underwood, and all Kalma heard 
it; 

Perhaps they are people. They 
mu.st have a trial. 

The dog-girl Joan dropped to 
her knees. “I have succeeded, 1 
have succeeded, I have suc- 
ceeded! You can kill me, dear 
people, but I love, love, love 
you!” 

The Lady Pane Ashash said 
quietly to Elaine, “I thought I 
would be dead by now. Really 
dead, at last. But I am not. I 
hpve seen the worlds turn, Elaine, 
and you have seen them turn 
with me.” 

The underpeople had fallen 
quiet as they heard the high- 
volume telepathic exchange be- 
tween the two great Ladies. 

The real soldiers dropped out 
of the sky, their ornithopters 
whistling as they hawked down 
to the ground. They ran up to 
the underpeople and began bind- 
ing them with cord. 

One soldier took a single look 
at the robot body of the Lady 



62 



GALAXY 



Pane Ashash. He touched it with 
his staff, and the staff turned 
cherry-red with heat. The robot- 
body, its head suddenly drained, 
fell to the ground in a heap of 
icy crystals. 

Elaine walked between the 
frigid rubbish and the red-hot 
staff. She had seen Hunter 

She missed seeing the soldier 
who came up to Jor darted to 
bind her and then fell back weep- 
ing, babbling, “She loves me! She 
loves me!” 

The Lord Femtiosex, who com- 
manded the inflying soldiers, 
bound Joan with cord despite her 
talking. 

Grimly he answered her: “Of 
course you love me. You’re a 
good dog. You’ll die soon, doggy, 
but till then, you’ll obey.” 

“I’m obeying,” said Joan, “but 
I’m a dog and a person. Open 
your mind, man, and you’ll feel 
it.” 

Apparently he did open his 
mind and felt the ocean of love 
riptiding into him. It shocked 
him. His arm swung up and back, 
the edge of the hand striking at 
Joan’s neck for the ancient kill. 

“No, you don’t,” thought the 
Lady Arabella Underwood. “That 
child is going to get a proper 
trial.” 

He looked at her and glared, 
Chief doesn’t strike Chief, my 
Lady. Let go my arm. 

Thought the Lady Arabella at 



him, openly and in public; “A 
trial, then.” 

In his anger he nodded at her. 
He would not think or speak to 
her in the presence of all the 
other people. 

A soldier brought Elaine and 
Hunter before him. 

“Sir and master, these are peo- 
ple, not underpeople. But they 
have dog-thoughts, cat-thoughts, 
goat-thoughts and robot-ideas in 
their heads. Do you wish to 
look?” 

“Why look?” said the Lord 
Femtiosex, who was as blonde as 
the ancient pictures of Baldur, 
and oftentimes that arrogant as 
well. “The Lord Limaono is ar- 
riving. That’s all of us. We can 
have the trial here and now.” 

Elaine felt cords bite into her 
wrists; she heard the Hunter 
murmur comforting words to her, 
words which she did not quite 
understand. 

“They will not kill us,” he 
murmured, “though we will wish 
they had, before this day is out. 
Everything is happening as she 
said it would, and — ” 

“Who is that she?” interrupted 
Elaine. 

“She? The lady, of course. The 
dear dead Lady Pane Ashash, 
who has worked wonders after 
her own death, merely with the 
print of her personality on the 
machine. “Who do you think told 
me what to do? Why did we wait 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



63 



for you to condition Joan to 
greatness? Why did the people 
way down in Clown Town keep 
on raising one D’joan after an- 
other, hoping that hope and a 
great wonder would occur?” 
“You knew?” said Elaine. “You 
knew . before it happened?” 
“Of course,” said the Hunter, 
“not exactly, but more or less. 
She had had hundreds of years 
after death inside that computer. 
She had time for billions of 
thoughts. She saw how it would 
be if it had to be, and I — ” 
“Shut up, you people!” roared 
the Lord Femtiosex. “You are 
making the animals restless with 
your babble. Shut up, or I will 
stun you!” 

Elaine fell silent. 

The Lord Femtiosex glanced 
around at her, ashamed at hav- 
ing made his anger naked before 
another person. He added quiet- 
ly: 

“The trial is about to begin. 
The one that the tall Lady or- 
dered.” 

IX 

X/'ou all know about the trial, 
so there is no need to linger 
over it. There is another picture 
of San Shigonanda, the one from 
his conventional period, which 
shows it very plainly. 

The street had filled full of 
real people, crowding together to 

64 



see something which would ease 
the boredom of perfection and 
time. They all had numbers or 
number- codes instead of names. 
They were handsome, well, dully 
happy. They even looked a great 
deal alike, similar in their hand- 
someness, their health and their 
underlying boredom. All of them 
had a total of four hundred years 
to live. None of them knew real 
war, even though the extreme 
readiness of the soldiers showed 
vain practice of hundreds of 
years. The people were beautiful, 
but they felt themselves useless, 
and they were quietly desperate 
without knowing it themselves. 
This is all clear from the paint- 
ing, and from the wonderful way 
that San Shigonanda has of form- 
ing them in informal ranks and 
letting the calm blue light of day 
shine down on their handsome, 
hopeless features. 

With the underpeople, the ar- 
tist performs real wonders. 

Joan herself is bathed in light. 
Her light brown hair and her 
doggy brown eyes express soft- 
ness and tenderness. He even 
conveys the idea that her new 
body is terribly new and strong, 
that she is virginal and ready to 
die, that she is a mere girl and 
yet completely fearless. The pos- 
ture of love shows in her legs: 
she stands lightly. Love shows in 
her hands: they are turned out- 
ward toward the judges. Love 



GALAXY 



' shows in her smile: it is con- 
fident. 

And the judges! 

The artist has them, too. The 
Lord Femtiosex, calm again, his 
narrow sharp lips expressing per- 
petual rage against a universe 
which has grown too small for 
him. The Lord Limaono, wise, 
twice-rebom, sluggardly, but 
alert as a snake behind the sleepy 
eyes and the slow smile. The 
Lady Arabella Underwood, the 
tallest true-human present, with 
her Norstrilian pride and the ar- 
rogance of great wealth, along 
with the capricious tenderness of 
great wealth, showing in the way 
that she sat, judging her fellow- 
judges instead of the prisoners. 
The Lady Goroke, bewildered at 
last, frowning at a play of for- 
tune which she does not under- 
stand. The artist has it all. 

And you have the real view- 
tapes, too, if you want to go to a 
‘museum. The reality is not as 
dramatic as the famous painting, 
but it has value of its own. The 
voice of Joan, dead these many 
centuries, is still strangely mov- 
ing. It is the voice of a dog- 
carved-into-man, but it is also 
the voice of a great lady. The 
image of the Lady Pane Ashash 
must have taught her that, along 
with what she had learned from 
Elaipe and Hunter in the ante- 
chamber above the Brown and 
Yellow Corridor of Englok. 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



The words of the trial, they too 
have survived. Many of them 
have became famous, aU across 
the worlds. 

Joan said, during inquiry, “But 
it is the duty of life to find more 
than life, and to exchange itself 
for that higher goodness.” 

Joan commented, upon sen- 
tence. “My body is your proper- 
ty, but my love is not. My love 
is my own, and I shall love you 
fiercely while you kill me.” 

When the soldiers had killed 
Charley-is-my-darling and were 
trying to hack off the head of the 
S’woman until one of them 
thought to freeze her into crys- 
tals, Joan said: 

“Should we be strange to you, 
we animals of earth that you 
have brought to the stars? We 
shared the same sun, the same 
oceans, the same sky. We are all 
from Manhome. How do you 
know that we would not have 
caught up with you if we had all 
stayed at home together? My 
people were dogs. They loved 
you before you made a woman- 
shaped thing out of my mother. 
Should I not love you still? The 
miracle is not that you have 
made people out of us. The mir- 
acle is that it took us so long to 
understand it. We are people 
now, and so are you. You will be 
sorry for what you are going to 
do to me, but remember that I 
shall love your sorrow, too, be- 

69 



cause great and good things will 
come out of it.” 

The Lord Limaono slyly ask- 
ed, “What is a ‘miracle’?” 

And her words were, “There is 
knowledge from Earth which 
you have not yet found again. 
There is the name of the Name- 
less one. There are secrets hidden 
in time from you. Only the dead 
and the unborn can know them 
right now: I am both.” 

^^he scene is familiar, and yet 
we will never understand it. 
We know what the lords Fem- 
tiosex and Limaono thought they 
were doing. They were maintain- 
ing established order and they 
were putting it on tape. The 
minds of men can live together 
only if the basic ideas are com- 
municated. Nobody has, even 
now, found out a way to record- 
ing telepathy directly into an in- 
strument. We get pieces and 
snatches and wild jumbles, but 
we never get a satisfactory record 
of what one of the great ones 
was trasmitting to another. The 
two male chiefs were trying to 
put on record all those things 
about the episode which would 
teach careless people not to play 
with the lives of the underpeo- 
ple. They were even trying to 
make underpeople understand 
the rules and designs by virtue 
of which they had been trans- 
formed from animals into the 



highest servants of man. This 
would have been hard to do, giv- 
en the bewildering events of the 
last few hours, even from one 
Chief of the Instrumentality to 
another; for the general public, 
it was almost impossible. The 
outpouring from the Brown and 
Yellow Corridor was wholly un- 
expected, even though the Lady 
Goroke had surprised D’joan; 
the mutiny of the robot police 
posed problems which would 
have to be discussed halfway 
across the galaxy. Furthermore, 
the dog-girl was making points 
which had some verbal validity. 
If they were left in the form of 
mere words without proper con- 
text, they might affect heedless 
or impressionable minds. A bad 
idea can spread like a mutated 
germ. If it is at all interesting, 
it can leap from one mind to an- 
other halfway across the universe 
before it has a stop put to it. 
Look at the ruinous fads and 
foolish fashions which have 
nuisanced mankind even in the 
ages of the highest orderliness. 
We today know that variety, 
flexibility, danger and the sea- 
soning of a little hate can make 
love and life bloom as they never 
bloomed before; we know it is 
better to live with the complica- 
tions of thirteen thousand old 
languages resurrected from the 
dead ancient past than it is to 
live with the cold blind-alley

perfection of the Old Common 
Tongue. We know a lot of things 
which the Lords Femtiosex and 
Limaono did not, and before we 
consider them stupid or cruel, we 
must remember that centuries 
passed before mankind finally 
came to grips with the problem 
of the underpeople and decided 
what “life” was within the limits 
of the human community. 

Finally, we have the testimony 
of the two Lords themselves. 
They both lived to very ad- 
vanced ages, and toward the end 
of their lives they were worried 
and annoyed to find that the 
episode of D’joan overshadowed 
all the bad things which had not 
happened during their long 
careers — bad things which had 
labored to forestall for the pro- 
tection of the planet Fomalhaut 
III — and they were distressed 
to see themselves portrayed as 
casual, cruel men when in fact 
they were nothing of the sort. If 
they had seen that the story of 
Joan on Fomalhaut III would 
get to be what it is today — one 
of the great romances of man- 
kind, along with the story of 
C’mell or the romance of the 
lady who sailed The Soul — they 
would not only have been dis- 
appointed, but they would have 
been justifiably angry at the 
fickleness of mankind as well. 
Their roles are clear, because 
they made them clear. The Lord 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



Femtiosex accepts the responrf- 
bility for the notion of fire; the 
Lord Limaono agrees that he 
concurred in the decision. Both 
of them, many years later, re- 
viewed the tapes of the scene and 
agreed that something which the 
Lady Arabella Underwood had 
said or thought — 

Something had made them do 
it. 

But even with the tapes to re- 
fresh and clarify their memories, 
they could not say what. 

We have even put computers 
on the job of cataloguing every 
word and every inflection of the 
whole trial, but they have not 
pinpointed the critical point ei- 
ther. 

And the Lady Arabella — no- 
body ever questioned her. They 
didn’t dare. She went back to her 
own planet of Old North Aus- 
tralia , surrounded by the im- 
mense treasure of the santaclara 
drug, and no planet is going to 
pay at the rate of two thousand 
million credits a day for the 
privilege of sending an investiga- 
tor to talk to a lot of obstinate, 
simple, wealthy Norstrilian peas- 
ants who will not talk to off- 
worlders anyhow. The Norstri- 
lians charge that sum for the ad- 
mission of any guest not selected 
by their own initiative so we will 
their own invitation; so we will 
never know what the lady Ara- 
bella Underwood said or did af- 

67 



ter she went home. The Norstri- 
lians said they did not wish to 
discuss the matter, and if we do 
not wish to go back to living a 
mere seventy years we had better 
not anger the only planet which 
produces stroon. 

And the Lady Goroko — she, 
poor thing, went mad. 

People did not know it till 
later, but there was no word to 
be gotten out of her. She per- 
formed the odd actions which we 
now know to be a part of the 
dynasty of Lords Jestocost, who 
forced themselves by diligence 
and merit upon the Instrumen- 
tality for two hundred and more 
years. But on the case of Joan 
she had nothing to say. 

The trial is therefore a scene 
about which we know everything 
— and nothing. 

We think that we know the 
physical facts of the life of D’joan 
who became Joan. We know 
about the Lady Pane Ashash who 
whispered endlessly to the under- 
people about a justice yet to 
come. We know the whole life 
of the unfortunate Elaine and of 
her involvement with the case. 
We know that there were in 
those centuries, when underpeo- 
ple first developed, many war- 
rens in which illegal underpeople 
used their near-human wits, their 
animal cunning and their gift of 
speech to survive even when 
mankind had declared them sur- 



plus. The Brown and Yellow 
Corridor was not by any means 
the only one of its kind. We even 
know what happened to the Hun- 
ter. 

For the other underpeople — 
Charley-is-my-darling, Baby- 
baby, Mabel, the S’woman, Or- 
son and all the others — we have 
the tapes of the trial itself. They 
were not tried by anybody. They 
were put to death by the soldiers 
on the spot, as soon as it was 
plain that their testimony would 
not be needed. As witnesses, they 
could live a few minutes or an 
hour; as animals, they were al- 
ready outside the regulations. 

A h, we know all about that 
now, and yet know nothing. 
Dying is simple, though we tend 
to hide it away. The how of dy- 
ing is a minor scientific matter; 
the when of dying is a problem 
to each of us, whether he lives on 
the old-fashioned 400-year-life 
planets or on the radical new 
ones where the freedoms of dis- 
ease and accident have been re- 
introduced; the why of it is still 
as shocking to us as it was to 
pre-atomic man, who used to 
cover farmland with the boxed 
bodies of his dead. These under- 
people died as no animals had 
ever died before. Jo5dully. 

One mother held her children 
up for the soldier to kill them 
alL 



68 



GALAXY 



She must have been of rat 
origin, because she had septup- 
lets in closely matching form. 

The tape shows us the picture 
of the soldier getting ready. 

The rat-woman greets him 
with a smile and holds up her 
seven babies. Little blondes they 
are, wearing pink or blue bon- 
nets, all of them with glowing 
cheeks and bright little blue eyes. 

“Put them on the ground,” 
said the soldier. “I’m going to 
kill you and them too.” On the 
tape, we can hear the nervous 
peremptory edge of his voice. He 
added one word, as though he 
had already begun to think that 
he had to justify himself to these 
underpeople. “Orders,” he added. 

“It doesn’t matter if I hold 
them, soldier. I’m their mother. 
They’ll feel better if they die 
easily with their mother near. I 
love you, soldier. I love all peo- 
ple. You are my brother, even 
though my blood is rat blood and 
yours is human. Go ahead and 
kill them soldier. I can’t even 
hurt you. Can’t you imderstand 
it? I love you, soldier. We share a 
common speech, common hopes, 
common fears, and a common 
death. That is what Joan has 
taught us all. Death is not bad, 
soldier. It just comes badly, 
sometimes, but you will remem- 
ber me after you have killed me 
and my babies. You will remem- 
ber that I love you now — ” 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



The soldier, we see on the 
tape, can stand it no longer. He 
clubs his weapon, knocks the 
woman down; the babies scatter 
on the groimd. We see his booted 
heel rise up and crush down 
against their heads. We hear the 
wet popping sound of the little 
heads breaking, the sharp cut-off 
of the baby wails as they die. We 
get one last view of the rat- 
woman herself. She had stood up 
again by the time the seventh 
baby is killed. She offers her 
hand to the soldier to shake. Her 
face is dirty and bruised, a trickle 
of blood running down her left 
cheek. Even now, we know she 
is a rat, an underperson, a modi- 
fied animal, a nothing. And yet 
we, even we across the centuries, 
feel that she had somehow be- 
come more of a person than we 
are — that she dies human and 
fulfilled. We know that she has 
triumphed over death: we have 
not. 

We see the soldier looking 
straight at her with eerie horror, 
as though her simple love, were 
some unfathomable device from 
an alien source. 

We hear her next words on the 
tape: 

“Soldier, I love all of you — ” 

His weapon could have killed 
her in a fraction of a second, if 
he had used it properly. But he 
didn’t. He clubbed it and hit her, 
as though his heat-remover had 

69 



been a wooden club and himself 
a wild man instead of part of the 
elite guard of Kalma. 

We know what happens then. 

She falls under his blows. She 
points. Points straight at Joan, 
wrapped in fire and smoke. 

The rat-woman screams one 
last time, screams into the lens 
of the robot camera as though 
she were talking not to the sol- 
dier but to all mankind: 

“You can’t kill her. You can’t 
kill love. I love you, soldier, 
love you. You can’t kill that. 
Remember — ” 

His last blow catches her in 
the face. 

She falls back on the pave- 
ment. He thrusts his foot, as we 
can see by the tape, directly on 
her throat. He leaps forward in 
an odd little jig, bringing his full 
weight down on her fragile neck. 
He swings while stamping down- 
ward, and we then see his face, 
full on in the camera. 

It is the face of a weeping 
child, bewildered by hurt and 
shocked by the prospect of more 
hurt to come. 

He had started to do his duty, 
and duty had gone wrong, all 
wrong. 

■poor man. He must have been 
one of the first men in the 
new worlds who tried to use 
weapons against love. Love is a 
sour and powerful ingredient to 



meet in the excitement of battle. 

All the underpeople died that 
way. Most of them died smiling, 
saying the word “love” or the 
name “Joan.” 

The bear-man Orson had been 
kept to the very end. 

He died very oddly. He died 
laughing. 

The soldier lifted his pellet- 
thrower and aimed it straight at 
Orson’s forehead. The pellets 
were 22 millimeters in diameter 
and had a muzzle velocity of 
only 125 meters per second. In 
that manner, they could stop 
recalcitrant robots or evil under- 
people, without any risk of pene- 
trating buildings and hurting the 
true people who might be inside, 
out of sight. 

Orson looks, on the tape the 
robots made, as though he knows 
perfectly well what the weapon 
is. (He probably did. Underpeo- 
ple used to live with the danger 
of a violent death hanging over 
them from birth until removal.) 
He shows no fear of it. in the 
pictures we have; he begins to 
laugh. His laughter is warm, gen- 
erous, relaxed — like the friendly 
laughter of a happy foster-father 
who has found a guilty and em- 
barrassed child, knowing full well 
that the child expects punish- 
ment but will not get it. 

“Shoot, man. You can’t kill 
me, man. I’m in your mind. I 
love you. Joan taxxght us. Listen 



70 



GALAXY 



man. There is no death. Not for 
love. Ho, ho, ho, poor fellow, 
don’t be afraid of me. Shoot! 
You’re the unlucky one. You’re 
going to live. And remember. 
And remember. And remember. 
I’ve made you human, fellow.” 

The soldier croaks, “What did 
you say?” 

“I’m saving you, man. I’m 
turning you into a real human 
being. With the power of Joan. 
The power of love. Poor guy! go 
ahead and shoot me if it makes 
you uncomfortable to wait. You’ll 
do it anyhow.” 

This time we do not see the 
soldier’s face, but the tightness of 
his back and neck betray his own 
internal stress. 

We see the big broad bear face 
blossom forth in an immense 
splash of red as the soft heavy 
pellet plow into it. 

Then the camera turns to 
something else. 

A little boy, probably a fox, 
but very finished in his human 
shape. 

He was bigger than a baby, 
but not big enough, like the 
larger underchildren, to have un- 
derstood the deathless import- 
ance of Joan’s teaching. 

He was the only one of the 
group who behaved like an or- 
dinary underperson. He broke 
and ran. 

He was clever: He ran among 
the spectators, so that the sol- 



dier could not use pellets or heat- 
reducers on him without hurting 
an actual human being. He ran 
and jumped and dodc,ad, fight- 
ing passively but desperately for 
his life. 

At last one of the spectators — 
a tall man with a silver hat — 
tripped him up. The fox-boy fell 
to the pavement, skinning his 
palms and knees. Just as he 
looked up to see who might be 
coming at him, a bullet caught 
him neatly in the head. He fell 
a little way forward, dead. 

People die. We know how they 
die. We have seen them die shy 
and quiet in the Dying Houses. 
We have seen others go into the 
400-year-rooms, which have no 
door-knobs and no cameras on 
the inside. We have seen pic- 
tures of many dying in natural 
disasters, where the robot crews 
took picture-tap^3 for the record 
and the investigation later on. 
Death is not uncommon, and it 
is very unpleasant. 

But this time, death itself was 
different. All the fear of death — 
except for the one little fox-boy, 
too young to understand and too 
old to wait for death in his moth- 
er’s arms — had gone out of the 
underpeople. They met death 
willingly, with love and calm- 
ness in their bodies, their voices, 
their demeanor. It did not mat- 
ter whether they lived long 
enough to know what happened 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



71 



to Joan herself: they had perfect 
confidence in her, anyway. 

This indeed was the new wea- 
pon, love and the good death. 

Crawlie, with her pride, had 
missed it all. 

The investigators later found 
the body of Crawlie in the cor- 
ridor. It was possible to recon- 
struct who she had been and 
what had happened to her. The 
computer in which the bodiless 
image of the Lady Pane Ashash 
survived for a few days after the 
trial was, of course, found and 
disassembled. Nobody thought at 
the time to get her opinions and 
last words. A lot of historians 
have gnashed their teeth over 
that. 

The details are therefore clear. 
The archives even preserve the 
long interrogation and responses 
concerning Elaine, when she was 
processed and made clear after 
the trial. But we do not know 
how the idea of “fire” came in. 

Somewhere, beyond sight of 
the tape-scanner, the word must 
have been passed between the 
four Chiefs of the Instrumental- 
ity who were conducting the 
trial. There is the protest of the 
Head of Birds (Robot), or police 
chief of Kalma, a Subchief 
named Fisi. 

The records show his appear- 
ance. He comes in at the right 
side of the scene, bows respect- 
fully to the four Chiefs and lifts 



his ri^t hand in the traditional 
sign for "beg to interrupt,” an 
odd twist of the elevated hand 
which the actors have found it 
very difficult to copy when they 
tried to put the whole story of 
Joan and Elaine into a single 
drama. (In fact, he had no more 
idea that future ages would be 
studying his casual appearance 
than did the others. The whole 
episode was characterized by 
haste and precipitateness, in the 
light of what we now know.) The 
Lord Limaono says: 

“Interruption refused. We are 
making a decision.” 

The Chief of Birds spoke up 
anyhow. 

“My words are for your decis- 
ion, my Lords and my Ladies.” 
“Say it, then,” commanded the 
Lady Goroke, “but be brief.” 
“Shut down the viewers. De- 
stroy that animal. Brainwash the 
spectators. Get amnesia your- 
selves, for this one hour. This 
whole scene is dangerous. I am 
nothing but a supervisor of omi- 
thopters, keeping perfect order, 
but I — 

“We have heard enough,” said 
the Lord Femtiosex. “You man- 
age your birds and we’U run the 
worlds. How do you dare to 
think ‘like a Chief’? We have re- 
sponsibihties which you can’t 
even guess at. Stand back.” 

Fisi, in the pictures, stands 
back, his face sullen. In that par- 



I ticular frame of scenes, one can 
' see some of the spectators going 
away. It was time for lunch and 
they had become hungry: they 
had no idea that they were going 
to miss the greatest atrocity in 
history, about which a thousand 
I and more grand operas would be 
} written. 

j Femtiosex then moved to the 
I .^climax. “More knowledge, not 
' less, is the answer to this prob- 
lem. I have heard about some- 
thing which is not as bad as the 
Planet Shayol, but which can do 
just as well for an exhibit on a 
civilized world. You there,” said 
he to Fisi, the Chief of Birds, 
“bring oil and a spray. Immedi- 
ately.” 

Joan looked at him with com- 
passion and longing, but she said 
nothing. She suspected what he 
was going to do. As a girl, as a 
dog, she hated it; as a revolution- 
ary, she welcomed it as the con- 
summation of her mission. 

The Lord Femtiosex lifted his 
right hand. He curled the ring 
finger and the little finger, put- 
ting his thumb over them. That 
left the first two fingers extend- 
ed straighf out. At' that time, 
the sign from one Chief to an- 
other, meaning, “private chan- 
nels, telepathic, immediate.” It 
has since been adopted by under- 
people as their emblem for poli- 
tical unity. 

The four Chiefs went into a 



tracelike state and shared the 
judgment. 

J oan began to sing in a soft, 
protesting, dog-like wail, us- 
ing the off-key plainsong which 
the underpeople had sung just 
before their hour of decision 
when they left the Brown and 
Yellow Corridor. Her words were 
nothing special, repetitions of the 
“people, dear people, I love you” 
which she had been communica- 
ting ever since she came to the 
surface of Kalma. But the way 
she did it has defied imitation 
across the centuries. There are 
thousands of lyrics and melodies 
which call themselves, one' way 
and another, The Song of Joan, 
but none of them come near to 
the heart-wrenching pathos of 
the original tapes. The singing, 
like her own personality, was 
unia.ue. 

The appeal was deep. Even the 
real people tried to listen, shift- 
ing their eyes from the four im- 
mobile Chiefs of the Instrumen- 
tality to the brown-eyed singing 
girl. Some of them just could not 
stand it. In true human fashion, 
they forgot why they were there 
and went absent-mindly home to 
lunch. 

Suddenly Joan stopped. 

Her voice ringing clearly across 
the crowd, she cried out: 

“The end is near, dear people. 
The end is near.”

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



73 



Eyes all shifted to the two 
Lords and the two Ladies of the 
Instrumentality. The Lady Ara- 
bella Underwood looked- grim af- 
ter the telepathic conference. The 
Lady Goroke was haggard with 
wordless grief. The two Lords 
looked severe and resolved. 

It was the Lord Femtiosex who 
spoke. 

“We have tried you, animal. 
Your offense is great. You have 
lived illegally. For that the pen- 
alty is death. You have interfer- 
ed with robots in some manner 
which we do not understand. For 
that brand-new crime, the penal- 
ty should be more than death; 
and I have recommended a pim- 
ishment which was applied on a 
planet of the Violet Star. You 
have also said many unlawful 
and improper things, detracting 
from the happiness and security 
of mankind. For that the penalty 
is reeducation, but since you 
have two death sentences al- 
ready, this does not matter. Do 
you have anything to say before 
I pronounce sentence?” 

“If you light a fire today, my 
lord, it will never be put out in 
the hearts of men. You can de- 
stroy me. You can reject my 
love. You cannot destroy the 
goodness in yourselves, no mat- 
ter how much goodness may an- 
ger you — ” 

“Shut up!” he roared. “I asked 
for a plea, not a speech. You will 

74 

L 



die by fire, here and now. What 
do you say to that?” 

“I love you, dear people.” 
Femtiosex nodded to the men 
of the Chief of Birds, who had 
dragged a barrel and a spray int o 
the street in front of Joan. 

“Tie her to that post,” he com- 
manded. “Spray her. Light her. 
Are the tape-makers in focus? 
We want this to be recorded and 
known. If the underpeople try 
this again, they will see that 
mankind controls the worlds.” He 
looked at Joan and his eyes 
seemed to go out of focus. In an 
unaccustomed voice he said, “I 
am not a bad man, little dog- 
girl, but you are a bad animal 
and we must make an example of 
you. Do you understand that?” 
“Femtiosex,” she cried, leav- 
ing out his title, “I am very 
sorry for you. I love you too.” 
With these words of hers, his 
face became clouded and angry 
again. He brought his right hand 
down in a chopping gesture. 

Fisi copied the gesture and the 
men operating the barrel and 
spray began to squirt a hissing 
stream of oil on Joan. Two guards 
had already chained her to the 
lamp post, using an improvised 
chain of handcuffs to make sure 
that she stood upright and re- 
mained in plain, sight of the 
crowd. 

‘Tire,” said Femtiosex. 

Elaine felt the Hunter’s body, 

GALAXY 



beside her, cramp sharply. He 
seemed to strain intensely. For 
herself, she felt the way she had 
felt when she was defrozen and 
taken out of the adiabatic pod 
in which she had made the trip 
from earth — sick to her stomach, 
confused in her mind, emotions 
rocking back and forth inside 
her. 

Hunter whispered to her, “I 
tried to reach her mind so that 
she would die easy. Somebody 
else got there first. I . don’t 
know who it is.” 

Elaine stared. 

The fire was being brought. 
Suddenly it touched the oil and 
Joan flamed up like a human 
torch. 

X 

rphe burning of D’joan at Fom- 
alhaut took very little time, 
but the ages will not forget it. 

Femtiosex had taken the cruel- 
est step of all. 

By telepathic invasion he had 
suppressed her human mind, so 
that only the primitive canine re- 
mained. 

Joan did not stand still like a 
martyred queen. 

She struggled against the 
flames which licked her and 
climbed her. She howled and 
shrieked like a dog in pain, like 
an animal whose brain — good 
though it is — caimot compre- 

THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



hend the senselessness of human 
cruelty. 

The result was directly con- 
trary to what the Lord Femtio- 
sex had planned. 

The crowd of people stirred 
forward, not with curiosity but 
because of compassion. They 
had avoided the broad areas of 
the street on which the dead un- 
derpeople lay as they had been 
killed, some pooled in their own 
blood, same broken by the hands 
of robots, some reduced to piles 
of frozen crystal. They walked 
over the dead to watch the 
dying, but their watching was not 
the witless boredom of people 
who never see a spectacle; it was 
the movement of living things, 
instinctive and deep, toward the 
sight of another living thing in a 
position of danger and ruin. 

Even the guard who had held 
Elaine and Hunter by gripping 
Hunter’s arm — even he moved 
forward a few unthinking steps. 
Elaine found herself in the first 
row of the spectators, the acrid, 
unfamiliar smell of burning oil 
making her nose twitch, the 
howls of the dying dog-girl tear- 
ing through her eardrums into 
her brain. Joan was turning and 
twisting in the fire now, trying 
to avoid the flames which wrap- 
ped her tighter than clothing. 
The odor of something sickening 
and strange reached the crowd. 
Few of them had ever smelled 

75 , 



the stink of burning meat before. 

Joan gasped. 

In the ensuing seconds of sil- 
ence, Elaine heard something 
she had never expected to hear 
before — the weeping of grown 
human beings. Men and women 
stood there sobbing and not 
knowing why they sobbed. 

Femtiosex loomed over the 
crowd, obsessed by the failure erf 
his demonstration. He did not 
know that the Hunter, with a 
thousand kills behind him, was 
committing the legal outrage of 
peeping the mind of a Chief of 
the Instrumentality. 

The Hunter whispered to 
Elaine, “In a minute I’ll try it. 
She deserves something better 
than that . 

Elaine did not ask what. She 
too was weeping. 

The whole crowd became aware 
that a soldier was calling. It took 
them several seconds to look 
away from the burning, dying 
Joan. 

The soldier was an ordinary 
one. Perhaps he was the one who 
had been unable to tie Joan with 
bonds a few minutes ago, when 
the Lords decreed that she be 
taken into custody. 

He was shouting now, shouting 
frantically and wildly, shaking 
his fist at the Lord Femtiosex. 

“You’re a liar, you’re a cow- 
ard, you’re a fool, and I chal- 
lenge you—” 



The Lord Femtiosex became 
aware of the man and of what 
he was yelling. He came out of 
his deep concentration and said, 
mildly for so wild a time: 
“What do you mean?” 

“This is a crazy show. There 
is no girl here. No fire. Nothing. 
You are hallucinating the whole 
lot of us for some horrible reason 
of your own, and I’m challeng- 
ing you for it, you animal, you 
fool, you coward.” 

I n normal times even a Lord 
had to accept a challenge or 
adjust the matter with clear talk, 
This was no normal time. 

The Lord Femtiosex said, “All 
this is real. I deceive no one.” 
“If it’s real, Joan, I’m with 
you!” shrieked the young sold- 
ier. He jumped in front of the jet 
of oil before the other soldiers 
could turn it off and then he 
leapt into the fire beside Joan. 

Her hair had burned away but 
her features were still clear. She 
had stopped the doglike whining 
shriek. Femtiosex had been in- 
terrupted. She gave the soldier, 
who had begun to burn as he 
stood voluntarily beside her, the 
smiles. Then she frowned, the 
gentlest and most feminine of 
smiles. Then she frowned, as 
though there were something 
which she should remember to 
do, despite the pain and terror 
which surrounded her. 



76 



GALAXY 



“Now!” whispered the Hunter. 
He began to hunt the Lord Fem- 
tiosex as sharply as he had ever 
sought the alien, native minds of 
Fomalhaut III. 

The crowd could not tell what 
had happened to the Lord Fem- 
tiosex. Had he turned coward? 
Had he gone mad? (Actually, the 
Hunter, by using every gram of 
the power of his mind, had mo- 
mentarily taken Femtiosex court- 
ing in the skies; he and Femtio- 
sex were both male bird-like 
beasts, singing wildly for the 
beautiful female who lay hidden 
in the landscape far, far below.) 

Joan was free, and she knew 
she was free. 

She sent out her message. It 
knocked both Hunter and Fem- 
tiosex out of thinking; it flooded 
Elaine;- it made even Fisi, the 
Chief of Birds, breathe quietly. 
She called so loudly that within 
the hour messages were pouring 
in from the other cities to Kalma, 
asking what had happened. She 
thought a single message, not 
words. But in words it came to 
this: 

“Loved ones, you kill me. This 
is my fate. I bring love, and love 
must die to live on. Love asks 
nothing, does nothing. Love 
thinks nothing. Love is knowing 
yourself and knowing all other 
people and things. Know — and 
rejoice. I die for all of you now, 
dear ones — ” 



She opened her eyes for a last 
time, opened her mouth, sucked 
in the raw flame and slumped 
forward. The soldier, who had 
kept his nerve while his clothing 
and body burned, ran out of the 
fire, afire himself, toward his 
squad. A shot stopped him and 
he pitched flat forward. 

The weeping of the people was 
audible throughout the streets. 
Underpeople, tame and licensed 
ones, stood shamelessly among 
them and wept too. 

The Lord Femtiosex turned 
wearily back to his colleagues. 

The face of Lady Goroke was 
a sculptxired, frozen caricature of 
sorrow. 

He turned to the Lady Arabel- 
la Underwood. “I seem to have 
done something wrong, my lady. 
Take over, please.” 

The Lady Arabella stood up. 
She called to Fisi, “Put out that 
fire.” 

She looked out over the crowd. 
Her hard, honest Norstrilian fea- 
tures were unreadable. Elaine, 
watching her, shivered at the 
thought of a whole planet full of 
people as tough, obstinate and 
clever as these. 

“It’s over,” said the Lady Ara- 
bella. “People, go away. Robots, 
clean up. Underpeople, to your 
jobs.” 

She looked at Elaine and the 
Himter. “I know who you are 
and I suspect what you have 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN

been doing. Soldiers, take them 
away.” 

The body of Joan was fire- 
blackened. The face did not look 
particularly human any more; 
the last burst of fire had caught 
her in the nose and eyes. Her 
young, girlish breasts showed 
with heart-wrenching immodesty 
that she had been young and 
female once. Now she was dead, 
just dead. 

The soldiers would have 
shoveled her into a box if she had 
been an imderperson. Instead, 
they paid her the honors of war 
that they would have given to 
one of their own comrades or to 
an important civilian in time of 
disaster. They unslung a litter, 
put the little blackened body on 
it and covered the body with 
their own flag. No one had told 
them to do so. 

\ s their own soldier led them 
up the road toward the 
Waterrock, where the houses and 
offices of the military were lo- 
cated, Elaine saw that he too 
had been crying. 

She started to ask him what 
he thought of it, but Hunter 
stopped her with a shake of the 
head. He later told her that the 
soldier might be punished for 
talking with them. 

When they got to the office, 
they found the lady Goroke al- 
ready there. 

78 



The Lady Goroke already 
there ... It became a nightmare 
in the weeks that followed. She 
had gotten over her grief and 
was conducting an inquiry into 
the case of Elaine and D’joan. 

The Lady Goroke already 
there . She was waiting when 
they slept. Her image, or perhaps 
herself, sat in on all the endless 
interrogations. She was particul- 
arly interested in the chance 
meeting of the dead lady Pane 
Ashash, the misplaced witch 
Elaine, and the non-adjusted 
man, the Hunter. 

The Lady Goroke already 
there . She asked them every- 
thing, but she told them noth- 
ing. 

Except for once. 

Once she burst out, violently 
personal after endless hours of 
formal, official work, “Your 
minds will be cleansed when we 
get through, so it wouldn’t matter 
how much else you know. Do 
you know that this has hurt me 
— me! — all the way to the 
depths of .everything I believe 
in?” 

They shook their heads. 

“I’m going to have a child, 
and I’m going back to Manhome 
to have it. And I’m going to do 
the genetic coding myself. I’m go- 
ing to call him Jestocost. That’s 
one of the Ancient Tongues, the 
Paroskii one, for ‘cruelty,’ to re- 
mind him where he comes from.

and why. And he, or his son, or 
his son will bring justice back in- 
to the world and solve the puzzle 
of the underpeople. What do you 
think of that? On second thought, 
don’t think. It’s none of your 
business, and I am going to do it 
an5nvay.” 

They stared at her sympathet- 
ically, but they were too wound 
up in the problems of their own 
survival to extend her much 
sympathy or advice. The body of 
Joan had been pulverized and 
blown into the air, because the 
Lady Goroke was afraid that the 
underpeople would make a good- 
vlace out of it; she felt that way 
herself, and she knew that if she 
herself were tempted, the under- 
people would be even more 
tempted. 

Elaine never knew what hap- 
pened to the bodies of all the 
other people who had turned 
themselves, under Joan’s leader- 
ship, from animals into mankind, 
and who had followed the wild, 
foolish march out of the Tunnel 
of Englok into the Upper City of 
Kalma. Was it really wild? Was 
it really foolish? If they had 
stayed where they were, they 
might have had a few days or 
months or years of life, but soon- 
er or later the robots would have 
found them and they would have 
been exterminated like the ver- 
min which they were. Perhaps 
the death they had chosen was 



better. Joan did say, “It’s the 
mission of life always to look for 
something better than itself, and 
then to try to trade life itself for 
meaning.” 

At last, the Lady Goroke called 
them in and said, “Good-by, you 
two. It’s foolish, saying good-by, 
when an hour from now you will 
remember neither me nor Joan. 
You’ve finished your work here. 
I’ve set up a lovely job for you. 
You won’t have to live in a city. 
You will be weather-watchers, 
roaming the hills and watching 
for all the little changes which 
the machines can’t interpret fast 
enough. You will have whole life- 
times of marching and picknick- 
ing and camping together. I’ve 
told the technicians to be very 
careful, because you two are very 
much in love with each other. 
When they re-route your synap- 
ses, I want that love to be there 
with you.” 

They each knelt and kissed her 
hand. They never wittingly saw 
her again. In later years they 
sometimes saw a fashionable 
ornithopter soaring gently ovei' 
their camp, with an elegant wom- 
an peering out of the side of it; 
they had no memories to know 
that it was the Lady Goroke, re- 
covered from madness, watching 
over them. 

T heir new life was their final 
life. 



THE DEAD LADY OF CLOWN TOWN 



79 



Of Joan and the Brown and 
Yellow Corridor, nothing re- 
mained. 

They were both very sympa- 
thetic toward animals, but they 
might have been this way even 
if they had never shared in the 
wild political gamble of the dear 
dead Lady Pane Ashash. 

One time a strange thing hap- 
pened. An underman from an 
elephant was working in a small 
valley, creating an exquisite rock 
garden for some important of- 
ficial of the Instrumentality who 
might later glimpse the garden 
once or twice a year. Elaine was 
busy watching the weather, and 
the Hunter had forgotten that he 
had ever hunted, so that neither 
of them tried to peep the under- 
man’s mind. He was a huge fel- 
low, right at the maximum per- 
missable size — five times the 
gross stature of a man. He had 
smiled at them friendily in the 
past. 

One evening he brought them 
fruit. Such fruit! Rare off -world 
items which a year of requests 
would not have obtained for or- 
dinary people like them. He 



smiled his big, shy, elephant 
smile, put the fruit down and pre- 
pared to lumber off. 

“Wait a minute,” cried Elaine, 
“why are you giving us this? 
Why us?” 

“For the sake of Joan,” said 
the elephant man. 

“Who’s Joan?” said the Hun- 
ter. 

The elephant man looked S5rm- 
pathetically at them. “That’s all 
right. You don’t remember her, 
but I do.” 

“But what did Joan do?” said 
Elaine. 

“She loved you. She loved us 
all,” said the elephant man. He 
turned quickly, so as to say no 
more. With incredible deftness 
for so heavy a person, he climbed 
speedily into the fierce lovely 
rocks above them and was gone. 

“I wish we had known her,” 
said Elaine. “She sounds very 
nice.” 

In that year there was bom 
the man who was to be the first 
Lord Jestocost.

A 

CENTURY OF 
FOSSIL MAN 

( I 'his,” I said to a visitor, 
handing him a fossilized 
trilobite from the Silurian per- 
iod, “is due to three accidents.” 
“Accidents?” he repeated, won- 
dering whether I mean what I 
said. 

“Accidents! Three of them. 
The first accident was that this 



81 



trilobite died under circumstan- 
ces which made it possible for it 
to become a fossil. The second 
accident was that the fossil was 
found. And the third was that it 
was foimd by somebody who 
recognized it for what it was.” 

The whole discussion had 
started with the chance remark 
that we don’t know yet whether 
the human race originated in 
Asia or in Africa. The fossil finds, 
I had said, are inconclusive so 
far, mainly because there are so 
few of them. Of course, it would 
have been appropriate if I could 
have handed my visitor a fossil 
human skull to illustrate my 
point. I couldn’t do that because 
there are so few of them, and 
for that reason they are where 
they belong, in museums and in 
university collections. Only about 
a century ago no museum any- 
where had a human fossil. As a 
matter of fact no director of a 
museum would have expected to 
see one. 

And that brings me to my 
story. 



■paleontology, the science of fos- 
^ sils and extinct life forms, 
is one of the sciences that were 
found essentially by one man. 
He was Georges Leopold, Baron 
Cuvier, a French naturalist, born 
at Montb^liard in 1769; and the 
work which became the foxmda- 
tion of the new science was his 



Recherches sar les ossemens tos- 
siles, or in English, Researches 
on Fossil Bones. It appeared in 
1824, only eight years before Cu- 
vier’s death. Cuvier had done 
wonders with the scant material 
he had at his disposal and it 
was only natural that he noticed 
that among his fossils there, 
fishes and amphibians, reptiles 
and mammals, crustaceans and 
worms, but that fossils of humans 
were conspicuous by their ab- 
sence. Man, Cuvier reasoned, 
must have been a late arrival on 
earth. The Bible, he pointed out, 
also said that Man had been 
created last. Hence Man had not 
been present when the other crea- 
tures became fossils and for that 
reason it was actually useless to 
look for human fossils. As Cuvier 
put it: Thomme fossil n' exists 
pas — “fossil man does not ex- 
ist.” 

Just one year after Cuvier’s 
death a Belgian paleontologist 
by the name of Schmerling fin- 
ished a voluminous work with 
the title. Account of the fossil 
bones found in caves in the Prov- 
ince of Lieie. In it he pointed 
out that he had found human re- 
mains in the same layers as 
bones of cave bears, mammoths 
and so forth, so that it seemed 
logical to assume that they had 
lived during the same period. 

If anybody who read Schmer- 
ling’s work remembered that the

No. 1 The cliff of the Neanderthal Valley before It became a limestone 

quarry. 



Baron von Schlotheim had re- 
ported the same situation from 
a place near Gera in Central Ger- 
many some time earlier (in 1820) 
he probably had the same ex- 
planation for both cases. Early 
settlers had buried their dead in 
the debris covering cave floors — 
and the human bones had there- 
by in death acquired companions 
they had never known when 
alive. 

For more than three decades 
nothing happened to disturb 
these assximptions. If people did 
not insist on building stone 
houses there might have been an- 
other three or four decades of 
peace and quiet. But people 
build, and one of the things they 
need for building is limestone. 

There was one source of lime- 



stone which was not only big but 
easily accessible. Near the small 
city of Mettmann in western Ger- 
many a river, the Dussel, had 
cut itself a deep and narrow can- 
yon into soft limestone. The gorge 
even had a name. Three centur- 
ies earlier a man by the name of 
Toachim Neumann had fallen in 
love with the romantic beauty of 
the gorge and had visited it again 
and again. Since he became fa- 
mous as the author of Christian 
hymns which he wrote under the 
name of Joachim Neander, the 
canyon was named in his honor 
after his death. It was named 
Neander Valley, or in German, 
Neanderthal. 

Tt was in 1856 that the limestone 
cliffs that formed the walls 



FOR YOUR INFORAAAUON 



83 



of the canyon became a quarry. 
Local people knew that there 
were several natural caves in the 
face of the cliff. They had even 
been given separate names. Two 
neighboring caves were called, 
nobody knows why, the Churches 
of Feldhof. 

The workmen began their task 
by cleaning out the caves, and 
just dumped the loose debris 
down the cliff to the bottom of 
the valley, some 70 feet below. 
While cleaning out the smaller 
of the two “churches” they found 
bones and felt obligated to re- 
port the fact to the owner of the 
quarry. 

The owner suspected that this 
might be important. Since the 
cave had been all cleaned out by 
the time he arrived, he ordered 
that the dumped material be 
carefully searched. 

Then he handed all the recov- 
ered bones to the locally famous 
Johann Carl Fuhlrott, a high 
school teacher, with the remark 
that these seemed to be bones of 
the cave bear of which he had 
heard so much. Fuhlrott saw im- 
mediately that the remains were 
human consisting of the two up- 
per arm bones fragments of other 
arm bones both femurs a frag- 
ment of the pelvis and the top of 
the skull — the latter was one of 
the bones that had been dumped. 
Fuhlrott looked at the heavy 
bony ridges over the eye sockets. 

84 



He noted that the whole skull 
was shallow with a receding fore- 
head. He considered the femurs 
to be unusually heavy — and 
concluded that he looked at the 
remains of a more primitive type 
of man. 

In a lecture he delivered soon 
afterwards (it was printed with 
some delay in 1859), he said so. 
But while Fuhlrott could con- 
sider himself a naturalist he knew 
that his knowledge of anatomy 
was restricted. But he also knew 
that Professor Schaaffhausen of 
the University of Bonn an ex- 
pert in human anatomy was in- 
terested in new discoveries. 

He sent the bones to Schaaff- 
hausen, who examined and meas- 
ured them with utmost care and 
published a report in 1858, stat- 
ing that he agreed with Fuhlrott; 
this was an individual with 
strangely primitive characteris- 
tics. Being a careful man, 
Schaaffhausen did not attempt to 
determine its age, saying that he 
hoped that further discoveries 
would provide definite clues. 

For a while Fuhlroot and 
Schaaffhausen stood alone. A Dr. 
PrunerBey in Paris said that 
these were probably just the re- 
mains of an old Celt who had 
died during a tribal migration. 
Professor Andreas Wagner in 
Gottingen considered it more 
likely that they were the bones 
of a Dutch sailor, while others 



guessed that it might be a Cos- 
sack who had taken part in the 
final campaign against Napoleon. 

Enter now Dr. Rudolf Virchow, 
professor of pathology, having 
been appointed director of the 
Pathological Institute in Berlin 
during the same year workers 
began cleaning out the caves of 
the Neanderthal. 

Since what I have to report 
about Virchow will sound as if he 
had not been too bright, I must 
say first that he was justly fa- 
mous as a medical researcher. He 
reformed the sanitation system 
of Berlin, and he (somewhat un- 
usually) was also very active 
politically. For years he was the 
leader of the Progressive Party 
of Prussia and was even elected 
a member of the Reichstag on 
the Liberal Party slate. But he 
had limitations. He had carefully 
investigated the tubercles in hu- 
man lungs and written an excel- 
lent description in a highly liter- 
ary style. But when it was sug- 
gested to him that these tuber- 
cles might be caused by a micro- 
organism he had nothing but 
sarcasm for the little country 
doctor who advanced this non- 
sensical idea. (The little country 
doctor later became a famous 
bacteriologist. His name was 
Robert Koch, and in Sweden 
they awarded him a Nobel Prize 
for medicine.)

No. 2. Skull of a Neanderthal man 
(old male) from La Chapello' 
auX'Saints, France. In the original 
skull from the Neander Valley 
only the portions above the line 
A — A were preserved. 

To Virchow the remains from 
the Neanderthal were just one 
more case of what he had been 
observing for years. He did not 
guess at nationality or tribe. All 
he could say that this man had 
been sick all his life. One could 
see the marks of his fonner suf- 
fering clearly. 

To begin with, this individual 
happened to be born with an un- 
usually long skull and greatly 
reduced sinus cavities. In his 
early childhood he had suffered 
severely from rachitis. But some- 
how he got over it and grew to 
manhood, probably to be a war- 
rior since some minor thickenings 
might be due to battle injuries. 
However, the main features of 
the skull which had misled Fuhl- 
rott (only a high school teacher, 
after all) and Schaaffhausen (a 
fine anatomist but not a path- 

85 




No. 3 Plihecanfbropus erecfus. Skull No. 

1 from Trinil 

ologist) had been produced by 
arthiitis deformans and old age. 
The outer layers of the skull had 
been reduced as a result of old 
age and new layers had formed 
on the inside with ossification of 
the skin enclosing the brain. 
What was left of the arms 
showed signs of severe arthritis. 

So said Schaaffhausen; and 
all this was not advanced as a 
possibility, or even a probability. 
It was preceded by the sentence: 
“We can conclude with absolute 
certainty — ” 

One of the men who supported 
Fuhlrott and Schaaffhausen was 
Professor William King in Eng- 
land, also an anatomist. After 
stating the reasons for his posi- 
tion, he then proceeded to give 
the bones the still famous name 
Homo neanderthalensis. 

But most scientists were re- 
luctant to go along. After all, 
Virchow was Virchow! How 
could they, who were not even 
medical men, dispute the findings 
of a pathologist? There was only 
one such find and it was certain- 
ly possible, if unusual, that the 



one specimen had belonged to a 
sickly individual. 

In the meantime — in 1864 — 
at least definite proof that Man 
and extinct mammals had been 
contemporaneous had been 
found. 

Jacques Boucher de Cr6ve- 
coeur de Perthes had for some 
years asserted that the stone arti- 
facts he had found had been 
weapons used by primitive man 
to hunt mammoths. But while 
these shaped stones, which might 
easily have been spearpoints, did 
exist, who could say what had 
been hunted with them? — if 
they had been hunting weapons 
at all. (And one could always 
point out that Boucher de Per- 
thes had written tragedies for 
the stage, novels for amusement 
and diplomatic notes for decep- 
tion. In short, that he had en- 
gaged in unscientific activities.) 
But the new proof, found by 
Edouard Lartet in a cave of the 
Vez6re Valley in southern France, 
was a piece of mammoth tusk, 
with the outline of a mammoth 
scratched into it. 

nphe final proof came from Bel- 
gium, from a cave at Spy 
in the vicinity of Namur. It con- 
sisted of two (incomplete) skel- 
etons of this t5T3e of man, along 
with bones of extinct animals 
and stone implements. The par- 
ticular kind of stone implements 



86 



GALAXY 



had been foimd earlier in France 
in a place named Le Moustier 
and had been provisionally lab- 
elled the Moust6rian Culture. 
We now know that it is typical 
for the Neanderthalers. But we 
also know that Lartet’s mam- 
moth drawings belongs to a later 
time, the Magdalenien, which 
was not “Neanderthal”. 

Other finds followed. Then 
some scientists began to feel that 
the name given by professor 
King was too specific. One of the 
suggestions made was Homo 
primigenius (or Homo primo- 
genitus') but by then everybody 
was careful. Since the name 
means “first” man it was not ac- 



cepted — maybe somebody 
would find a still older form. But 
many scientists were willing to go 
along with the suggestion Homo 
diluvianus. The geological period 
preceding the present period was 
then generally called Diluvium, 
so that the name was suggestive 
of the time. (Now the geological 
present is called the “holocene” 
and the preceding period, for 
which “Ice Age” is another syn- 
onym, goes under the name of 
“pleistocene.”) 

As for the still older form it 
already had a name. Professor 
Ernst Haeckel, reasoning that at 
one time a form halfway between 
ape and man must have existed, 




FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



87 



had coined the term Pithecan- 
thropus or “apeman” for this hy- 
pothetical being. (In his work 
General Morphology, first pub- 
lished in 1866.) And a Dutch 
physician, Eugene Dubois by 
name, had joined the Dutch Col- 
onial Services for the purpose of 
being sent to the tropics, where 
he was going to look for the com- 
mon ancestor of both present- 
day man and of Neanderthal 
man. 

He was sent to Java. There he 
learned that fossils had been dis- 
covered in the banks of the Ben- 
gawan river near a place called 
Trinil. When the river was at its 
lowest point in 1890 he began to 
dig. 

His first success, as far as 
human remains were concerned, 
was a single tooth, but Dubois 
said to himself that that tooth 
could have belonged to a now 
extinct species of ape. However, 
in 1894 he could shout success. 
He had found the roof of a skull 
first and later and some distance 
— about 30 feet — away a left 
femur. 

As long as he had the skull 
fragment only he had thought 
that it belonged to a large now 
extinct gibbon. But the very 
human looking femur made it 
clear that he had found what 
Haeckel had only deduced, 
namely Pithecanthropus erectus, 
the “upright apeman”. 

88 




SOCKET 

Fig. 5. Profiles of the tops of the skulls of 
three early forms of humans. 

V irchow was asked about his 
opinion. Virchow pointed 
out that the femur showed a 
pathological change — a bone 
spur which indicated that the 
owner had suffered from a deep- 
seated abscess which evidently 
had healed, indicating nursing by 
others of its kind. Hence the 
femur was human. 

The skull, on the other hand, 
belonged to a large extinct gib- 
bon. The two bones had noth- 
ing to do with each other; after 
all they had been found some 
distance apart. Later on Virchow 
changed his opinion. The layer 
was probably too old to contain 
human remains, and if there had 
been a gibbon-like creature of 
this size it might have walked 
upright because it was too heavy 
to live in the treetops like the 
gibbons of our time. By that time 
Virchow was in his seventies and 
respect had somewhat waned. 
Others went ahead with their in- 
vestigation. They were determ- 
ined to find out whether this 
was, or had been, an apeman or 
not. They did not deny that an 

GALAXY 



apeman might have existed. 

“Brain capacity” became the 
new battle cry. 

Living humans pygmies 

excluded, but otherwise without 
regard as to skin color, nationali- 
ty, religion or credit rating — 
have an average brain capacity of 
about 1500 cubic centimeters. 
The Neanderthal types from 
Germany, Belgium, France and 
elsewhere in Europe averaged 
1200 cubic centimeters or a little 
more. A large gorilla, largest of 
the apes, fell a little short of 700 
cubic centimeter. 

How about Pithecanthropus? 
Since the skull roof was incom- 
plete there was a little leeway in 
computing the former content, 
but the disagreement was minor. 
It ranged from 900 to 935 cubic 
centimeters. Nicely in the mid- 
dle, between goriUa on the one 
side and Homo neanderthalensis 
on the other. 

The unsolved problem that re- 
mained was one of distance. The 
valley of the Bengawan was very 
far from the valley of the Vezere 
or even from Croatia where more 
Neanderthal men had been 
found. However, if you discount- 
ed the arms of the Sunda Sea 
between Java and the Asian 
mainland (and who could say 
whether they had existed then?), 
there were no insurmountable ob- 
stacles between Java and Franca. 
Even a slowly wandering tribe, 



if it kept going, could do it in 
just one generation. 

The sequence seemed clear: 
some unknown ancestor first, 
then Pithecanthropus, then 
Neanderthal man, then modem 
man. 

If you believed in this sequ- 
ence in Europe in 1900 you were 
under faint suspicion of being a 
socialist, unless you had a Ph. 
D. to indicate that you knew 
what you were talking about. By 
1914 you could believe in this 
sequence without arousing politi- 
cal suspicious, through a doctor- 
ate was still helpful.

Now we know much more, but 
aren’t so sure any more. 

On the one hand we have 
more reason to think that Pithe- 
canthropus was ancestral to 
Neanderthal man. On the other 
hand there is a great deal of 
doubt whether Neanderthal man 
is ancestral to us. 



I T et me take the latter prob- 
I lem first, if only because I 

sometimes encountered a sur- 
I prised reaction when I say so. 

How could Neanderthal man 
! not be ancestral, since he was 
around a long time earlier? I 
think that a comparison with 
dog-breeding will illustrate the 
E>oint. The animal which was to 
become the domesticated dog 
was probably a small jackal-like 
form. Slowly it was bred larger 
into forms somewhat resembling 
today’s greyhound, though smal- 
ler. Then (this is just an example, 
not dog-breeding history) let us 
say that breeders produced the 
English bulldog, a dog of speci- 
alized shape. Much later other 
I breeders went after another shape 
I of dog, say a poodle. 

I But they would start with the 
! original stock, not with the speci- 
alized bulldog. 

Neanderthal man would cor- 
respond to the bulldog of this ex- 
ample, an early and specialized 
offshoot. Some skulls have been 
found that look like Neander- 



thal man, but with less pro- 
nounced special features. Some 
researchers have assumed that 
they are hybrid forms. But it is 
just as possible that they are an 
older and not yet so specialized 
form of Neanderthalers. 

The history of the discoveries 
of human fossils since Dubois 
unearthed Pithecanthropus 
would make a very long article 
by itself, but at this point we 
need only the most pronounced 
highlights. In 1929 Dr. Davidson 
Black discovered skulls near 
Peking which were subsequently 
labelled Sinanthropus pekinensts, 
with a brain capacity higher 
than that of Pithecanthropus but 
still less than Neanderthal. 
More specimens of Pithecant- 
thropus were added from San- 
giran (Java) by Dr. G. H. R. von 
Koenigswald. A very large Nean- 
derthal man turned up in Rhode- 
sia, Africa. And southern Africa 
added a whole series of small 
forerunners of Man which are 
collectively called the australo- 
pithecines. (The word has noth- 
ing to do with the Australian 
continent, it merely means 
“southern monkeys”.) 

One theory has it that our 
own ancestors originated in 
Africa and migrated northward 
to Europe to turn into early 
Europeans. Those who stayed on 
Africa were the ancestors of the 
Africans of today. According to 



90 



GALAXY 



that theory, the Neanderthal 
type originated in eastern Asia 
and performed a westward mi- 
gration to Europe rather late in 
their history. But no decision on 
whether this theory or rival 
theories are correct can be made 
at the moment. 

Cince the question of who is 
~ ancestral to whom cannot yet 
be decided, researchers have sort- 
ed all human fossils into three 
groups, once more using brain 
volume as the criterion. They 
distinguish : 

(A) the australopithecines, 
with a brain capacity .of 450 to 
700 cc; 



(B) Homo erectus, with a 
brain capacity of 775 to 1200 
cc; 

(C) Homosapiens, with a 
brain capacity of over 1200 cc. 

This sorting scheme puts 
Pithecanthropus into the Homo 
erectus group, but puts the late 
European neanderthalers (a s 
well as the neanderthaler from 
Rhodesia) into the Homo sapi- 
ens group. To repeat, this is 
essentially a method of sorting, 
and does not necessarily indicate 
actual relationships. To clear 
that question up we need many 
more of the “triple accidents.”

bit to his already very high stature as one of science-fiction's best-liked and 
most prolific authors. Ever since we've been after him to tell us more of 
his strange and wonderful words of the future — the Dorsal and the

This was the world fhct 
machines had made. Could 
men hope fa win it back? 



I 

eastern sky glittered 
over the city and the sun 
came up. 

Robin Hedging wasn’t one of 
the superstitious kind who 
thought you would die within 
twenty-four hours of seeing the 
morning sun through glass. Nev- 
ertheless, he lowered the. window 
of the bus to stare out at it. This 
was always a good moment for 
him, when the rain ration had 



stopped falling and the sun rose 
before you got to work. 

The city stood high on piers 
above the plain. The plain as yet; 
would be dark. That was what, 
gave Robin the thrill: the 

thought of that grirh black land 
where no humans went, where 
terrors dwelt. Covertly, he cir-' 
cled himself. 

His father looked up from be- 
side him, catching the gesture. 

“What’s the matter, son? 



92 




You thinking something you 
shouldn’t do?” 

“It’s nothing.” 

“You worrying about seeing 
the sun through glass? You don’t 
have to. You’re wearing your 
spectacles — that makes two lots 
of glass. The superstition says 
you only die if you see the sun 
through one bit of glass.” 

“That means I’m going to die, 
Father. I opened the window 
and saw it through my spectacles 
alone.” Robin spoke with as 
much of a sneer as he could mus- 
ter, but a pang tore at his heart. 
He had not thought enough. But 
he’d seen the sun through one 
thickness of glass before and not 
died . Only maybe then there’d 
been some extenuating circum- 
stances . Maybe he’d seen a ro- 
bot before seven . 

His father’s pouchy face shook. 

“You’re a careless young fool, 
Robin. You’ll cost me my job 
yet.” 

“You know what happens to 
people who voice their greatest 
fear?” 

That was a remark to provide 
a row in any company, but a 
man sitting behind the Hedgings 
leaned forward and tapped Rob- 
in on the shoulder. 

“Don’t mind me butting in, 
young H, but I could hear what 
you and your dad were saying. I 
don’t think you’ve got anything 
to worry about. The saying is 



that you mustn’t see the sun 
through a pane of glass. Now you 
wouldn’t count your specs as a 
pane of glass would you, so 
you’re okay.” 

Old Sam Hedging dug his son 
hard in the ribs, and with a 
downward droop to his mouth 
indicated he was to say as little 
as possible. He then turned to 
look at the intruder. 

Ovine was a sad baggy man 
with a square face on which the 
patina of old eczema papules was 
partly concealed below a strag- 
gling moustache. His one-piece 
suit was new, and of course 
sharp blue. Both Hedgings dread- 
ed his presence, on the bus 
or in the Distributive Point, but 
were afraid to say so. 

“What are spectacles if they 
aren’t panes of glass?” Sam 
asked. 

“I’m only trjdng to help the 
boy.” 

“Well, I’m asking you, O, what 
are spectacles if they aren’t 
panes of glass?” 

“I suppose you’re right.” 
Ovine turned his face away, and 
then, struck by a sudden 
thought, said, “But in that case 
they are two panes of glass, so 
your son’s all right.” 

“I’m the best judge of that — ” 

Robin tried not to listen to the 
argument. He liked the journey 
to work, but these older men al- 
ways spoilt it with their tiny ar- 



guments. This third deck of the 
bus was full of men, mostly in 
working one - pieces, haggling 
over little things. Well, you took 
your choice: you haggled over 
little things, or you kept quiet. 
There did not seem to be any 
other alternatives. 

rr^hey were passing over 
Dunshinnan Bridge now. 
Robin braced himself. As the 
great lighted palace of the bus 
trundled forward at its statutory 
twenty miles an hotir, he looked 
down into the canyon. Yes, night 
was still down there, impervious 
to the lights on the bridge, night 
and the ancestral earth. He 
thought he saw something white 
crawl down there — but it would 
have been a sheet of paper if it 
was anything. 

Though the population was 
held steady now, the government 
had deemed it necessary to ex- 
pand the city. That had been 
over four — or was it five? — 
centuries ago, but Robin had 
studied urbography during his 
year at school. He still recalled 
some of the details. 

The new sector, Dimshinnan, 
had been built up on piles to 
join the rest of the city. But an 
error had’ been made. Always 
there were errors, in govern- 
ment, in engineering, in life. One 
understood that. The cybos and 
robos were no more effective at 



dealing with error than were hu- 
mans. Dunshinnan had been con- 
structed with its base a meter 
lower than the main city and 
with a gulf of a hundred and 
thirty meters separating the two 
sections. It was a large error; 
but bridges were built to span 
the gulf, no harm was done — 
and every morning Robin got 
his stomach-wrenching view of 
midnight. 

The first stop over the bridge 
was where the Hedgings and 
Ovine and one or two others — 
the pallid Farven, the choleric 
Claysbank — got off. They 
climbed down onto the walk, old 
Sam Hedgings and Ovine still 
joined in grumbling talk. It was 
not far to the edge of the Dun- 
shinnan, but high walls prevent- 
ed one looking over. At first, be- 
fore the walls had been erected, 
people had thrown themselves 
over the railings into the drop. 
There was still a mystique about 
it. Particularly on Kennedy and 
Vareller Days, dedicated parties 
would scale the walls and sacri- 
fice themselves over the drop. 
You heard about it in whispers. 

Robin checked himself at Dis- 
tributive Point D 2’s door. Far- 
ven laid a hand on his arm. 

“You’re dreaming again, 
young H,” he said, smiling with 
a nervy twitch. “F’s go before 
H’s under a threshold, or they 
used to when I was a boy.”

Robin apologized and stepped 
back. The little group went in 
in alphabetical order, those who 
knew their alphabet helping the 
others. This was an important 
juncture, the beginning of work, 
when obviously one had to be 
careful. Demons were most ac- 
tive in the early morning. 

The lights came on in D 2. Su- 
pervisor stood there awaiting 
the men. He was the only cybo 
who remained switched on dur- 
ing the night, a large and immo- 
bile bulk of a machine. His sides 
and the containers on his sides 
had become plastered with no- 
tices, waybills, delivery slips and 
chalked figures. It was consid- 
ered unlucky to remove these 
until Renovation Day. 

“Come in, humans. Equality 
and happiness in your day’s 
w-w-work.” 

Supervisor had developed 
a slight stammer with his w*s. 
Farven, the mech, was unable to 
remedy it; when the robomech 
arrived on his bi-monthly in- 
spection of the point, he would 
repair it. 

Robin followed his father up 
to Supervisor. They asked the 
traditional question, “ Is there 
any special w-w-work you re- 
quire of us today?” It was reck- 
oned judicious to imitate the 
speech of Supervisor, thus gath- 
ering for oneself some of his 
power. 



As always, the answer was neg. 
ative. 

^^he Hedgings climbed into 
their gallery; already the 
first deliveries of goods were ar- 
riving. Claysbank waddled 
round, switching on the auxil- 
iary robos. The first one he ac- 
tivated rolled behind him, clat- 
tering to itself as it checked the 
output of its fellows, recharging 
them from its own power sup- 
plies if necessary. As more and 
more machines came alive, the 
hall filled with noise and light 

For Robin, it was a cheering 
noise. This was life. No ill- 
omens; everything working with 
as much efficiency as could be 
humanly expected. He fol- 
lowed his father into their little 
hut up on the catwalk. Already 
they had a light on their switch- 
board. It was a sign of plenty. 
The spirits were harmless. 

Old Hedging acknowledged 
the signal, settling himself down 
into their battered chair as he 
did so. 

“Grocery consignment One. 
DP D2. One thousand two hun- 
dred sixty-five nine-ounce cans 
marrow soup.” 

Down on the floor, they could 
see the robotruck that had an- 
nounced itself. It had drawn in 
to the first bay, where one of the 
point’s loaders hauled off its 
freight with padded metal 



hands, stacking the cans with its 
auxiliary hands so that they 
stood separately on the conveyor 
belt behind it and were carried 
one by one into the distance. 

In response to the an- 
nouncement, Sam shifted a bead 
along a thin wire. Supervisor 
would be keeping exact de- 
tails of the entry; Sam’s was just 
a rough double-check. 

“Grocery consignment Two. 
DP D2. Five hundred twenty- 
eight twenty-ounce cans mary- 
cake pudding, two hundred nine 
ten-ounce cans marycake pud- 
ding.” 

“Milk consignment. DP D2. 
Two hundred nine-ounce con- 
tainers Grade A milk. Six hun- 
dred sixty-two eighteen-ounce 
containers Grade A milk. Three 
hundred ninety-three twenty- 
eight-ounce containers Grade A 
milk.” 

Laconically Sam moved two 
more beads across the wire. 
Business was warming up. More 
robotrucks were arriving with 
more of the day’s supplies for 
Dvmshinnan Second District. 
They called their orders method- 
ically as they entered. The auto- 
matic cop jockeyed them into 
place, his hand-sized fliers lead- 
ing them to allotted bays, where 
they were unloaded. The big hall 
was humming and stutter- 
ing with the activity of robots 
and humans. 



The whole city was humming 
with activity. It was the same 
sort of activity, did Robin but 
know it, that characterized 
a chicken’s rushing around 
when its head is cut off. The me- 
chanical business of city 
life ground on, mindlessly. 

No conscious government was 
left. Men capable of governing 
died or were killed or shot them- 
selves or escaped centuries ago. 
The machinery of government 
ground on with no human hand 
to steer it. In the steel palm of 
the city, life crawled thought- 
lessly, and obeyed the laws of a 
metal jungle. A million witless 
robos kept the system going, and 
each year became a little more 
entangled with the system. 

From his vantage point, 
Sam saw the newscart trundle in. 
It was a red vehicle with auto 
tracks on either side, and very 
noticeable among the subdued 
colors of the other vehicles. 

“I’m going down onto the 
floor, Robin. Do you think you 
can manage?” 

“Of course. Father. Luck!” 
“And you, boy.” 

They both circled them- 
selves with inpointing forefin- 
gers, and Sam moved along the 
catwalk and down to the floor. 

Moving carefully so as not to 
touch any of the robos — with 
good reason, for it was consid- 
ered a sign of forthcoming in- 



96

Jury if you touched one of them 
while ftey were at work — he 
reached the red vehicle just as it 
was announcing its con- 
signment. 

“Newspost consignment. DP 
D2. Four hundred seventy copies 
City. Three hundred eighty- 
three copies City and Star. 
Three hundred fifty-two copies 
Tidings. Seventy copies Dun- 
shinnan Light.” 

Dexterously, Sam picked cop- 
ies of three of the four newsdi- 
gests off the racks before they 
were tossed onto the conveyor. 
Claysbank arrived and began to 
do the same thing. Smiling, Sam 
signalled a thumbs-up sign at his 
son, watching through the cabin 
window. 

Someone in DP D2 went short 
of their morning news every 
morning. No system is perfect. 
The men in the point were care- 
ful to see that it was a different 
house that missed out each time. 

II 

P utting the tablets in his 
pocket, old Hedging 
strolled to the far end of the 
bay. Always, if the day had be- 
gun well, he liked this little ex- 
ercise, liked to see that every- 
thing was going smoothly, liked 
to smell the sweet oil and warm 
metal and the occasional tang of 
bad food, where something had 



fallen off the conveyor belt and 
eluded the sweep of the cybo- 
cleaner. You couldn’t have a bet- 
ter job than in the distributive 
point — except in Government, 
of course. But that was not for 
the likes of the Hedgings. He 
felt happy that he had inherited 
this job, and comfortable to 
think that he would hand it 
down to Robin. 

His reverie faded. Ovine was 
watching him. Not watching him 
openly, but standing behind a 
a stanchion and spjdng, for all 
the world like a banshee in a 
cartoon. He pretended to look 
the other way when he saw Sam’s 
eye on him. 

Ovine’s job was one of the 
rare kind that machines did less 
efficiently than a man of aver- 
age ability. 

He was a floor retriever. Of 
the material that fell to the 
floor, not all was rubbish to be 
swept into the metal maws of the 
cleaners; much of it was perfect- 
ly good food and such like, 
which had tumbled off the con- 
veyor and could still be used. 
For some reason — probably 
a design flaw — the clean- 
ers found difficulty in distin- 
guishing such articles from gen- 
uine trash. But Ovine could, so 
Ovine had a genuinely function- 
al job, and was therefore regard- 
ed by supers like the Hedgings 
and Farvan with suspicion and 



98 



GALAXY 



contempt, and the fear tiiat went 
with suspicion and contempt A 
retriever’s job, boasting no par- 
ticular pitch of its own, was non- 
inheritable. Ovine had arrived 
to take up the job only last 
month. He was not a good acqui- 
sition. 

“You looking for something?” 
Sam asked him. 

“No, Mr. Hedging,” Ovine 
said. 

Tt was a deadly insult. Only 
if they had been eating to- 
gether would it have been propi- 
tious for Ovine to have used any- 
thing but Sam’s initial when ad- 
dressing him. To have one’s 
name spoken out loud like this 
was asking for trouble. 

Angrily, Sam lumbered for- 
ward. Ovine backed away in 
alarm, but before he could get 
away, Sam broke one of his tab- 
lets between them. The printed 
circuits lay on the floor in a scat- 
ter of glass. The misfortime had 
been handed back to its instiga- 
tor. 

Although Ovine had been de- 
feated, Sam was unsettled by the 
incident. He strolled round the 
floor, grumbling to the other 
men, with whom Ovine was just 
an unpleasant newcomer. Sooth- 
ed by the S3rmpathy he gained, 
Sam retmned to the little cabin 
up in the roof. 

The beads were piling up on 



the other side of the ware. Sam 
took over from his son, gave him 
the copy of the Light and settled 
to look through the other news- 
digests. 

Robin turned the pages of the 
tablet slowly. He hked to watch 
the pictures struggle slowly into 
life and color. Somehow their 
efforts to perform efficiently al- 
ways woke a chord of sympathy 
in him. Their meaning interest- 
ed him less. These stories, fact 
and fiction mixed, and told all 
in picture form, had never 
meant much to him. He dropped 
the tablet, exchanged signs with 
his father and went in his turn 
for a stroll about the point. 

His thoughts were chiefly on 
Gina Lombard, their new lodger. 
So beautiful, that girl, so shy 
and yet so lively, with arms so 
ripe and soft! It would be good 
to get back and see her . He 
caught Ovine looking at him. 

“Are you wanting to speak to 
me?”, he asked. 

“No — er, no, young H. I was 
merely thinking how busy we 
are today,” Ovine said, fingering 
his moustache. “I am not quite 
used to the routine yet, being 
new here.” 

“Where did you work before?” 

“I was on structure mainte- 
nance.” 

Robin had no desire to talk. 
He moved away, and went along 
the other side. Farven popped 



JUNGLE SUBSTITUTE 



99 



out of a companionway and laid 
a hand on his arm; Robin was 
none too fond of the way Far- 
ven clutched arms, but he greet- 
ed the old man civilly enough. 

“You don’t want to talk to that 
O too much, young H,” Farven 
said, putting his pale nose up to- 
wards Robin’s eyes, as if to peck 
at them. “He’s got the evil eye. 
He upset your father not ten 
minutes ago. And see that mous- 
tache on his face — isn’t that a 
sign of Neg?” 

“You are being old-fash- 
ioned,” Robin protested. 

“Am I? Am I now? We shall 
see. But remember this: tomor- 
row night is Wellpurgers’ Night 
. , O may get his name burnt if 
he isn’t too careful.” 

R obin sucked in his breath. 

Something cold tingled down 
his back. He hated these old 
men with their relish of the rites; 
they seemed to see it less as a 
grim necessity than as a pleas- 
ure. 

“He’s new. We must try to 
make allowances,” he said, and 
moved off before Farven could 
answer. The old man became 
garrulous and addressed you like 
a public meeting if he was upset. 

Dodging an empty truck rat- 
tling towards the exit, Robin 
climbed down the nearby com- 
panionway. This was the section 
of the point that fascinated him 



most. The steps wound down for 
a long way; there were also ele- 
vators, but only robos used them. 

He emerged into what was 
known as the Services. The Ser- 
vices had one' overriding attrac- 
tion for him. They were on the 
ground, the real ground, 
the Earth, the territory he 
glimpsed when crossing Dun- 
shinnan Bridge. It lay beyond 
the concrete walls. 

The Services formed a com- 
plex series of sub-roads, entirely 
enclosed, entirely lit by selumce. 
Robin was careful not to get in 
the way of the purely automatic 
traffic that moved by. Its reac- 
tions were not always as fast as 
they should be, which was why 
everything was geared down to 
travel at no more than twenty 
miles an hour. At twenty miles 
an hour, human and robo reac- 
tions work at maximum efficien- 
cy together. 

A slinker with a large D2 
painted on its side moved up 
and offered itself. Robin jumped 
into the small cab, grateful to be 
out of the rancid wind that blew 
down here. They chugged down 
the straight road that was D2. 

That straight road ran for an 
uncurving ten and a half miles. 
Above it was the double row of 
dwellings, one thousand two 
hundred and sixty-five of them, 
that made the D2 Avenue. In 
Dunshinnan there were four 



100 



GALAXY 



hundred such Services below 
four hundred such avenues, some 
longer, some shorter than this. 
The city proper, of course, was 
a bigger proposition altogether. 

From the roof appeared the 
conveyor belt that had been 
loaded in the distributive point 
Robin had just left. It worked to 
the lower level in steps, feeding 
its contents onto another and 
synchronized belt that ran at eye 
level all along the Services. Cy- 
bocheckers fussed at this trouble 
point. Quick btlrsts of code 
flashed up to Supervisor, squat- 
ting impeturbably somewhere 
above. 

Chugging further, the slinker 
moved beneath the houses. Here 
Robin felt less comfortable, al- 
though the gloom they had en- 
tered held its own kind of fear- 
ful pleasure. This was a region 
of stretching hands, lit only by 
the EL of the bulkhead above. 
As the eye-level belt rumbled 
down the ten-mile stretch, little 
photoelectric eyes winked secret 
signals to the bulkhead above. 

A load for House 549 signalled 
itself to House 549. As it rode 
beneath the house, autoarms 
came down, scooping hands lift- 
ed the load, bore it up and into 
chute mouths that gaped open in 
the bulkhead. Circling himself, 
Robin watched the process. He 
had watched it for years. It nev- 
er ceased to hold him. In the 



busy feeding movements of the 
arms and mouths there was a 
symbol of some colossal and un- 
ending greed bigger than a hu- 
man greed. 

The Services maintenance 
trucks came round less frequent- 
ly than they should do (in fact 
some heretics whispered that the 
city was slowly running to a 
standstill). The arms and jaws 
developed minor eccentricities. 
Some snatched too soon, some al- 
most too late; many squeaked or 
whined as they did their task — 
and at this time of day they were 
kept busy. No. 634 had greedy 
arms that snatched 632 ’s gro- 
ceries as well as its own. No. 987 
regularly broke its fruit juice 
jars. These foibles were known 
to the robos, and allowed for 
where possible. 

T he clatter of falling goods 
and the buzz of alarmed cy- 
bos came to Robin. He called to 
the slinker to stop, jumped out 
and looked back down the som- 
ber subway. 

“City sprites, the main supply 
belt has stopped!” he exclaimed. 

The eye-level belt was still on 
the move. The belt coming down 
from above had lurched to a 
halt. He heard men’s voices 
shouting, his father’s among 
them. 

A figure appeared, running 
down the steps of the stopped 



JUNGLE SUBSTITUTE

conveyor belt. It was Ovine. He 
slipped among rolling cans, 
threw up his hands and fell on- 
to the moving belt knees first. 
He buckled and stayed there. 

Clattering feet sounded down 
the companionway. The red- 
faced Claysbank appeared, bran- 
dishing a stick. Farven and Sam 
Hedging were not far behind 
him. Above their voices echoed 
the voice of Supervisor, calling 
for order. 

Although he knew they were 
not after him, Robin felt alarm. 
These sudden persecutions were 
common; whether or not he was 
their victim, they scared him. 

As his pursuers arrived in the 
Services, Ovine pulled himself 
up. The belt had carried him 
some way towards where Robin 
stood. He got onto his knees, and 
above him mouths opened and 
mechanical hands reached down 
for him. Robin shouted. 

In that moment he was no 
longer a doubter. He believed to 
the hilt all the whispers he had 
ever heard. He knew that the 
city really belonged to a Higher 
Power — and that the Higher 
Power had heart as well as hands 
of metal. 

His scream acted as a warning 
to Ovine. The retriever looked 
up in time. As the arms came 
down, he jumped. He landed al- 
most at Robin’s feet. 

“Don’t let them get me I” 



One of the cybos had stepped 
into the path of the running 
men, its arms spread. Claysbank 
hit it across the shoulder. It lost 
its balance and fell. Something 
inside it sizzled and flashed. 

Robin stood before Ovine. He 
had no weapon, but he could not 
let the man be killed without go- 
ing to his rescue. Gasping, Ovine 
picked himself up, half-hearted- 
ly attempting to explain as he 
stood behind Robin. Robin was 
not listening. For the attackers 
had stopped. Beyond the cybo 
they stood, staring at its length, 
and at the smoke curling from it 

III 

A ll the way home, old 
Hedging talked of the in- 
cident. The smoke issuing from 
the metal body had formed the 
sign of the circle. He had seen 
it, and the others thought they 
had too. It must mean some- 
thing. 

Whatever it meant, it had 
stopped their hunt for Ovine. Bit 
by bit, Robin pieced together 
what had happened. Ovine, 
walking carelessly across the 
floor, had got in the way of a 
robotruck. The truck had 
swerved and bowled into anoth- 
er vehicle. Together, the 
two trucks had jammed into the 
conveyor belt and stopped it. 
“You know what it means 



102 



GALAXY 



when two robos hit each other,” 
Sam said in a fearful imdertone. 
“Some human has put them at 
cross purposes. Who’d do that 
but Ovine? That’s why we de- 
termined to have his blood. Oth- 
erwise the spirits might have had 
ours.” 

“So we should have had him,” 
agreed Farven from the seat in 
front, “but for that sign of the 
circle. What’s it mean? The 
powers of metal must be on 
Ovine’s side.” 

“They’re against us right 
enough,” Robin agreed. “We’ve a 
thousand man-hours in overtime 
to do now, to make up the value 
of that cybo. You shouldn’t have 
knocked him down.” 

to ignore this asser- 
tion, Farven said merely, “It’s 
Wellpurging Night tomorrow. If 
Ovine is fool enough to show his 
face tomorrow, we must have his 
blood.” His nose was as sharp as 
a dagger. 

He nodded his parting bene- 
diction curtly as he moved to 
leave the bus. 

The Hedgings were gloomily 
silent when they stepped off at 
Avenue C378. They had some 
way to walk down the pedes- 
trian path to their home. The 
city, large though it was, was vir- 
tually without architecture. Ev- 
erything had been spread out, 
with several low buildings tak- 
ing the place of the large dty 




JUNGLE SUBSTITUTE 



103 



blocks that had been the fashion 
a score of centuries ago, back in 
the days of improperly mechan- 
ized groimd cities. The central- 
ization that created the need for 
big buildings, as well as traffic 
problems, had also been done 
away with. Civic centers had 
been dispersed. The Ser- 
vices supply routes solved the 
old pressing need for conven- 
ient shopping centers. Govern- 
ment itself took place in fully 
automated hutments. There was 
no core to the city, only a logic 
and a finite number of streets. 

The front wall of their home 
was adorned with a motif of col- 
ored geometrical designs, func- 
tional as well as decorative, for 
the motif served as an addition- 
al means of identifying the 
house beside the number. It was 
said that no two houses in the 
entire city bore the same pat- 
tern. Otherwise they were all 
alike. 

T hey genuflected on the 
threshold, waited until no- 
body wearing a black suiting 
was in sight, and went in. Robin 
was glad to see that Gina Lom- 
bard was in. 

“Hello, L, you are back 
promptly.” They were not yet 
familiar enough to call each 
other by their first initial. 

“I was arranging your gro- 
ceries. I hope you don’t mind. 



Their wants for the day had 
come up through the Services 
hatch and lay in the delivery 
baskets. Robin shuddered to 
think of what would have hap- 
pened to Ovine if the metal 
hands had caught him and tried 
to force him into that two-foot- 
square hatch. Death was every- 
where. He saw how necessary it 
was to propitiate it. 

He lost some of his unease as 
he talked to Gina. She was beau- 
tiful with her trim black hair 
that came almost to a peak above 
her eyes; and her conversation, 
though guarded by formal- 
ity, had an unusual qual- 
ity' about it that interested Rob- 
in. Instinctively he felt she was 
“unsafe”, without knowing quite 
what he meant by that. He felt 
nothing but pleasure when his 
father moodily retired to the sit- 
ting room and turned on the iUi- 

scop. 

Robin and Gina were sitting 

together on the kitchen bench 
when Mrs. Hedging arrived. She 
had won herself some reputation 
as a hag, and spent much of ev- 
ery day going among her neigh- 
bours, counselling them. As her 
popularity spread further afield, 
her days became longer. Since 
the morrow was to be a special 
day, she opened the supper 
without a word. 

Robin felt his account of what 
happened at the DP die on his 



104 



GALAXY 



Hps; though he spoke to Gina, 
he knew his mother was listen- 
ing, and feared that she would 
construe something evil from his 
tale. Was there not some prohi- 
bition about retelling bad events? 

In the night, he had a vile 
dream. People he knew took on 
a sudden menace and closed in 
on him. They extended steel 
claws at him. He fell through 
the ground. He fell through 
space. But space had a floor. On 
the floor stood his parents. He 
fell towards them. They opened 
their mouths. The inside of their 
mouths was pocked and rough- 
ened by eczema. As he fell, their 
tongues — 

He woke. In the dark, an abys- 
mal rumble came. The rubbish 
hatch was emptying auto- 
matically into the Services, 
where it would be collected in 
the morning. Throughout the 
city, and Dunshinnan, thou- 
sands, millions, of hatches 
would be vomiting their muck 
down into the cavernous depths. 
The fact became part of his 
nightmare. He could hardly 
struggle out of it. 

Stranded at last on the muddy 
shore of wakefulness, Robin 
wiped his brow and gulped for 
breath. He climbed from his 
bunk and peered out of the win- 
dow. 

All was utterly quiet, utterly 
dark — but somewhere across 



the city he thought a fire burned. 
He desperately needed the com- 
fort of Gina’s bed, but had not 
the courage to leave his tiny 
cabin. 

\ t work in the Distribu- 
tive Point next morning, 
he remained ill at ease. The 
omens had set against him. 

He told nobody, but he had 
seen a cloud like a cross in the 
sky, and his spectacles had mist- 
ed when he drank his morning 
beverage — a sure presenti- 
ment that there were things hid- 
den from him, awaiting their 
time. Walking moodily about 
the floor, behind one of the un- 
packing bays, he came across 
Ovine’s vest. 

Its sharp blue rendered it in- 
stantly identifiable. He shied at 
it, and looked about to see if 
anyone was watching. 

John Ovine had not arrived 
that morning. The men had 
cursed and demanded his address 
of Supervisor. Supervisor had 
sent them stonily back to work. 
The mood in the place was bad. 
Even up in the cosy little hut on 
the catwalk, which had been 
handed down through four gen- 
erations of • Hedgings, ten- 
sion reigned in every creak of 
Sam’s swivel chair. 

Robin plunged in his hand in- 
to the breast pocket of Ovine’s 
garment. He brought out a note- 



JUNGLE SUBSTITUTE 



105 



book. He retired to the men’s 
room to investigate it, making 
the sign of the circle over it. 

The notebook bore stamped 
initials on its cover, GIB, and 
beneath it the words for which 
the initials stood. Government 
Investigation Bureau. 

It fell from Robin’s hands. 
Trembling, he picked it up 
again and leafed through it. 

The contents were obscure, be- 
ing mainly in note form, or in 
words that defied Robin’s simple 
reading standards. But their in- 
tent was clear enough, even to 
him. Ovine had been watching 
them for the government, and 
was making a report on them. 
He had found all the supers re- 
dundant. Of the humans working 
in the Distributive Point, only 
the functional job Ovine was 
temporarily holding — the de- 
spised job of floor retriever 
— had any practical purpose. 
The list of men who could be 
dismissed included both Hedg- 
ings and the pallid Farven. 

“But — but — we’ve got rights 
to the job!’’ 

He was standing in the metal 
cubicle, whispering the words 
aloud. The job was threatened. 
There were rumors about what 
happened to people who could 
not find jobs, just as there was 
glum tattle about what hap- 
pened to the aged who were tak- 
en into homes. 



His father held documents of 
inheritance for the checking job, 
it was true. But the agreement 
was with the family, had been 
for over two centxuies. If the 
Distributive Point cancelled 
the arrangement, there would be 
nothing they could do about it. 

Who owned the DP? He didn’t 
know — the government pre- 
sumably. But who was the gov- 
ernment? Who owned the Gov- 
ernment Investigation Bureau? 
Obviously, those same faceless 
people ... or powers. 

His dream came back to him. 
The ground was opening be- 
neath him sure enough. 

IV 

H e stuck it in the Distribu- 
tive until midday. His fa- 
ther and the other men only 
played on his nerves with their 
remarks about hunting down 
Ovine and sacrificing him as a 
warlock during the night’s 
revels. He knew how feeble these 
affairs often were when the eve- 
ning came, but the talk of blood 
did him no good. When the rest 
of them went down to the auto- 
bar, he slipped out. 

Supervisor would not miss 
h im , or if he was missed would 
not sack him. He was — no, he’d 
never realized it till now — 
redundant, as the watching eyes 
of Ovine had quickly seen. He 



106 



GALAXY 



was a super. It was no term of 
praise; it probably meant super- 
fluous. 

Though Robin was not a per- 
ceptive man, a vision came to 
him. It came in the form of a 
question: how long ago did the 
present state of affairs crystal- 
lize? 

His education in the robo and 
illiscop classes had been of the 
most rudimentary during his 
year at school. He had no con- 
cept of history, but after the 
question came the reflection: 
things can’t always have been 
like this. 

He did not know what a large 
mental step he had taken. 

First, he needed someone to 
talk to. He thought of the youths 
he played football with once a 
I week; there was nobody there he 
cared to confide in. He thought 
of Gina and her bright eyes. She 
would be someone who would be 
able to think — perhaps more 
clearly than he could. He did not 
know where she worked, for 
there were tabus about inquiring 
into other people’s jobs, but 
there might be an address he 
could find in her room. He 
caught a bus home. 

It was strange, moving round 
the town at this time of day; he 
had a sudden breath of unac- 
customed freedom that carried 
him back to his early boyhood 
before civilization closed in on 



him. But the clerks talking 
the seat behind him reminded 
him that captivity could not be 
eluded by a bus ride. They were, 
talking about the Dark Thing 
that flew over the city on Well- 
purging Night. He might have 
been sitting with his workmates! 

As they crawled over Dun- 
shinnan Bridge, he looked down 
and saw the earth far below. It 
was in shadow and no features 
were discemable. On sudden im- 
pulse, Robin pulled Ovine’s 
notebook out of his pocket, fling- 
ing it wide of the bus. 

Fluttering like a tiny live 
thing, it fell below the level of 
the bridge. The parapet cut it 
from view. 

Alighting at C378, he became 
suddenly cautious. Some of his 
excitement left him. Th^ 
last perscMi he wanted to see was^ 
his mother. It was unlikely, h^ 
thought, that she would be at 
home, but she would be in the 
neighborhood and particu-, 
larly active on a day like this.^ 
Interference from her would be 
intolerable. 

Few people were about. Hq 
moved forward fast, not liking 
to run. People did not run. The 
two women he passed kept their 
eyes to themselves. He let him- 
self through the front door. 

“Mother! L!” he called in a 
whisper, hearing his heart beat. 

Something moved in the kitch- 



JUNGLE SUBSTITUTE 



107 



en. Swivelling his head, eyes 
astare, he saw the evening’s meal 
tip out of the hatch into the bas- 
ket. Smiling limply to himself, 
he moved upstairs to Gina’s cab- 
in. His nerves were bad. The 
house held a weird desolation; 
even the lights and shadows that 
lay about its floors felt unnatur- 
al at this unvisited time of day. 
A stair creaked under his tread 
and a rictal jerk took the comer 
of his mouth. 

Cursing himself, making the 
circle, he went at a run into 
Gina’s tiny cabin. 

I t was better there. A faint 
prurient interest strength- 
ened him when he opened her 
tiny closet and saw her dress 
there. He touched its fabric. 

“Gina!” he said, but there was 
no answer. 

She had so few possessions. In 
her suitcase under the pink face 
towel he came on the leather 
notebook with the initials GIB 
stamped on the cover. 

When he had uttered a few 
broken noises, he opened it. 
Written inside was her name, 
and the address of the Govern- 
ment Investigation Bureau. He 
had seen the same address in 
Ovine’s notebook, without tak- 
ing it in. 

Now the whole business was 
on a different footing. Finding 
Ovine’s notebook had shown 

108 



him a trap was in operation; 
finding Gina’s notebook told 
him the trap was aimed at him 
and his father. 

He hardly took in the few 
scanty notes in the notebook. 
Mostly there were symbols — 
Gina, he could see at a glance, 
operated on a more sophisticat- 
ed level than Ovine, for all that 
they worked for the same organ- 
ization — though on one page, 
under his initials, she had 
scrawled, “Good intelligence po- 
tential, poor lad, but a savage, 
just a savage.” 

He was making little uncouth 
sounds to himself, trying to take 
the shape of these new things. 
His first impulse was to escape 
but there was nowhere to es- 
cape to. So he had to go and con- 
front Gina. 

A sound came that was not 
his. Mouth jerking open, he 
turned. A terrible thing stood 
just inside the doorway, a thing 
with an idiot metal face and 
body of fur, tatty fur that ended 
in human feet. 

He screamed hate and fear at 
it with all his lungs’ strength as 
he flung himself upon it. He had 
the girl’s open suitcase held by 
the handle. He struck the thing 
with the comer of it. 

The thing shrieked and fell 
back, striking its head on the 
doorpost. Then it slid slowly to 
the floor. The metal mask 

GALAXY 



dropped away as it went, reveal- 
ing the wizened face of Robin’s 
mother. Striking the mat, the 
body twitched, kicked inef- 
fectually at the wall and was si- 
lent 

Almost beyond horror, Robin 
sank to his knees, bmshing the 
stupid mask under the bunk. 
This was a new Wellpurging cos- 
tume his mother had on. Once 
he called to her. Even when the 
faintest exhalation of breath 
came to his ears, he could not 
bring himself to touch her. Sud- 
denly strength came back to his 
chilled muscle fiber. He up and 
ran. 

V 

A n the way to the GIB ad- 
dress, he argued with him- 
self. She’d had no right to come 
sneaking up to him like that. 
She should have taken that ter- 
rifying mask off, apeing the 
puissance of robos. His guilt re- 
mained, whatever he told him- 
self. 

Yet he felt no love or regret. 
His mother had always been 
aloof, wrapped in the mysteries 
of her hagdom. He might have 
behaved foolishly, but he had 
had the sense to take a small 
steak knife from the kitchen as 
he left. He clutched it in his 
pocket like a ju-ju. 

The GIB stood on a comer of 

JUNGLE SUBSTITUTE 



a main trafficway. On the oppo- 
site comer was a canteen. Robin 
entered it, gave his works num- 
ber and received a plateful of 
food in exchange for the pledge 
of an hour’s overtime. 

This was a poor move to begin 
with. The pledge would be sent 
back to his DP, who would then 
have a check on his whereabouts. 
He thought, I need to get away 
to another city. But how did one 
go about it? Was it possible? 

The meal was welcome. He ate 
it slowly, his eyes on the GIB 
building. He realized he 
was lonely and frightened. He 
had broken territorial tabus; he 
had committed matricide; if the 
Dark Thing flew tonight, it 
would have a call for him. 

People were beginning to leave 
the building opposite. Robin 
grew more undecided. At last he 
rose to go, and at that moment 
he saw Gina in the street. 

She was walking towards the 
GIB. Hurriedly, Robin removed 
his spectacles and mbbed them 
on his shirt before taking anoth- 
er look. It was Gina. Her head 
was down, and she carried de- 
pression in every line of her 
sleek body. As she entered the 
modest door of the GIB, Robin 
crossed the road after her. 

In the doorway, a cluster of 
people leaving work got in his 
way. They saw him and made 
the quick gestures of covering 

109 



themselves. Having no idea what 
tabu he had offended against, 
Robin could oidy conclude that 
here in a different region of 
town, and in a different busi- 
ness, people must have different 
tabus. He pushed past them and 
went upstairs. 

The interior of the GIB was 
shabby and utilitarian, even by 
the standards to which the 
Hedgings were accustomed. A 
robot stood at the top of the 
stairs, but it seemed to be out of 
commission. Doors with glass 
panels stood open, the rooms be- 
yond for the most part deserted. 
When he came to a door that 
was closed, he threw it open. 

It was a tiny cabin with one 
window, giving a view across to 
the canteen in which he had eat- 
en. It was empty, but over by the 
window was a closet, the door of 
which was open. Faint sounds — 
gasping or weeping — came 
from it. For a second, skin 
crawled along Robin’s neck; 
then he moved forward. 

Gina turned and came into 
his arms. He thrust a hand over 
her mouth, though fetish objects 
like lips and teeth touched his 
palm. 

“I’m not going to hurt you, L. 
I just want to ask you questions. 
Calm downl” 

W hen she stopped strug- 
gling and her eyes looked 



less wild, he removed his hand. 
“You’re a matricide!” she said. 
She had been back to her 
room — it must have been al- 
most immediately after Robin 
had left — and found Mrs. 
Hedging at the foot of the stairs, 
dead. The hag had lived long 
enough to drag herself a little 
way for help. Shocked, Robin sat 
on Gina’s table and told her 
what had happened. As he fin- 
ished, lights came automatically 
on in the room. 

Looking round in surprise, he 
saw the tawdry little room for 
the first time. It was recogniz- 
able as a room that had been in- 
habited for centuries; the atmo- 
sphere reminded him so much of 
the Hedging hut in DP2 that he 
felt a momentary nostalgia. 
Nodding to the line of ancestors’ 
skulls on the shelf above the 
door, he a^ed, “You hold this 
room by inheritance?” 

“No. I’m temporary here 
while the boss is on an investiga- 
tion elsewhere. Robin, why do 
you tell me all this? You must 
see I’m yoxu- enemy.” 

“Sometimes you’re closer 
to your enemies than your 
friends.” 

She walked over and switched 
the light off, so that the deep 
blue outside the window turned 
blankety gray. 

“Robofficers’ll get me unless I 
do something,” he said. 



no 



GALAXY 



“Robofficers rarely kill hu- 
mans unless they are sick or 
aged. Didn’t you observe that? 
But no — all you people have 
been carefully trained not to use 
your powers of observation, not 
to believe in cause and effect. In- 
stead, you’re indoctrinated into 
tying your minds up with a tis- 
sue of superstitions! Robin, can’t 
you see how man is lost in this 
city, ruling himself by fear and 
mob law and gobbledy-gook?” 
Shaking his head as if to avoid 
her words, he grasped her wrist. 

“You don’t say why you were 
spying on us. You were working 
with Ovine, weren’t you?” 

“Let go of me! Listen, never 
mind what I was doing. Just be- 
lieve this — I have more reason 
to suspect you than you me. If 
you will trust me, I will get you 
out of here.” 

Where was out? 

“You’re Government,” he 
said. “You’re going to have me 
dissected.” 

“You savage! Can’t you see 
there is no government as you 
understand the term? The peo- 
ple left in this city are incapable 
of rational thought. Reasoning 
man opted out of this city over 
six centuries ago! He began to 
leave over a thousand years ago, 
when he first found a machine 
could do his thinking for him. 
He made a big error then, think- 
ing his machines were efficient, 

JUNGLE SUBSTITUTE 



thinking that he could trust 
them more than he could trust 
himself.” 

“And can’t he?” 

“Never, Robin. Even the most 
complex machine, the computer, 
is just a sort of special fool. 
When men shaped themselves to 
fit into a computerized world, 
they became fools them- 
selves, they sank back into this 
sort of urban savagery, this 
ghastly mixture of automation 
and ancestral skulls!” 

Dazed, he groped for an an- 
swer. There was, must be an an- 
swer. He knew the necessity for 
ancestral skulls. They in- 
sured one’s inheritance, and — 
From outside, a shriek came 
from the drab sky, growing loud- 
er fast 

I t was almost night. It was 
Wellpurging Night. The few 
clouds in the sky were dappled 
with the last stains of sundown. 
In the north, a thing with spread 
wings rose. It was black. It tra- 
veled unwaveringly, and slow- 
ly as if to survey every soul in 
the city. Two red eyes blinked 
down. The Dark Thing was in 
flight. 

Robin sank to his knees. Of all 
the people in the city, he was 
the one it was after. He had 
transgressed the most. His heart 
struggled to break free and rise 
up to that shape of retribution. 

Ill 



She was tugging his hair and 
crying to him to get up, smack- 
ing his face, twisting his ear, cry- 
ing. In pain, he hit back, 
grasped her round the legs, bur- 
ied his face in her warm thigh. 
She fell on top of him. 

She was half-laughing. 

“Get up, you great savage! 
Come on. I’ll take you out of 
here — away from the city.” 

He was sober at once. He rose 
and helped her to her feet. 

“I want to get out of the city,” 
he said. It was all he had ever 
wanted — and it had taken him 
till now to realize it. 

As the Dark Thing shrieked 
overhead — there were cries 
from the streets to mark its pas- 
sage; people would be dying out 
there — they hurried into the 
gloom of the passage. A man 
stood there with a gun. 

He flashed a torch in their 
eyes and they came to a shocked 
halt. 

“I’ve been listening to every- 
thing you said.” His voice was 
less steady than his gim. “You 
are both guilty of crime talk. I 
saw you in the canteen, young 
H. I saw you through this win- 
dow when you put your light on. 
I know just what you are up to.” 

Robin recognized the sad and 
baggy face. 

“Ovine!” he exclaimed. 

“O to you, thanks., I still be- 
lieve in the law, if you don’t 

112 



Miss L, you must take me with 
you, out of the city. I want to get 
away from here. Take me with 
you or I’ll shoot you both and 
swear it was my duty.” 

“Turn your torch off,” she or- 
dered. Her voice was calm. “You, 
can’t come. Ovine. Resign your- 
self to the fact.” 

In a humble voice he said, “I 
can’t bear this GIB job. Miss L. 
I’m no good at it. It’s been in my 
family over four centuries, but 
I’m just a failure. Wherever I go 
to investigate, they always dis- 
cover me. I’m an outcast. I’m al- 
ways chased and beaten. 
I can’t—” 

Robin’s blow caught him in 
the midriff. He doubled up, 
dropping the torch and slipping 
to the floor. 

Gina seized Robin’s arm and 
led him along the corridor. “My 
big brave savage!” she mur- 
mured. 

“You were pretty calm, 
weren’t you?” 

“Yes. I happened to know that 
that gun of his was an old family 
heirloom, but he had no — shots, 
or whatever the word is. No fuel 
for it. Gun fuel isn’t available 
any more.” 

'^hey came out of the build- 
ing. Distantly down the ave- 
nue a bonfire burned. Figures 
danced round it and there was 
some shouting. The lights of the 

GALAXY 



canteen burned; silhouetted by 
them was a knot of men. Robin 
held the girl back. He recognized 
some of the men. His father was 
there. 

“I gave my address away to 
them by eating in the canteen,” 
he whispered. “They aren’t look- 
ing this way. Can we get round 
the back?” 

They investigated a side alley 
running between the GIB build- 
ing and the next. It led nowhere. 
As they worked their way back. 
Ovine emerged from the build- 
ing, still clutching his stomach, 
and staggered out into the road. 
A cry went up from the group of 
men as they recognized him. 

Ovine turned and ran down 
the avenue towards the bonfire. 
With whoops and shrieks, the 
others gave chase. Sam Hedging 
and Claysbank were in the lead. 
Taking advantage of the distrac- 
tion, Robin anci Gina hurried 
onto the trafficway and jumped 
aboard a tram. 

After a silence, he said, “You 
must have known Ovine well.” 

“No. I told you, I was not per- 
manent there. One day you’ll un- 
derstand the hopelessness of the 
network of this city’s life. The 
GIB was carrying out an investi- 
gation to find how many men in 
DP2 are redundant. Ovine — 
had all gone well — would have 
made his report. You would all 
have been declared redimdant. 



but nothing would have hap- 
pened. The report would have 
been filed in the entrails of 
some idiotic machine — and 
next generation the work would 
have been done all over again, 
just as it was last generation by 
Ovine’s father, and the genera- 
tion before that by his grandfa- 
ther. You see, the GIB itself is 
redundant!” 

“But then—” 

“AU humans in the city are 
redundant. They’ve got no 
meaning and no purpose. The 
machines just find them little 
jobs to keep ’em quiet.” 

VI 

XT^hen they got off the bus, 
’ ’ she led the way to a near- 
by door. 

“Is this a trap, Gina?” 

She opened the front door im- 
patiently, stepping aside to let 
him in before her. 

“You’d better come in 
and see.” 

Annoyed with himself for 
doubting her, he walked in. 
Heavy padded hands came up 
and grasped his head. 

In the dark he fought with 
fear and fury. But the thing was 
of metal that held him, and had 
more than one pair of hands. In 
no time he was hamstrung. They 
were in utter dark, and then a 
light filled his eyes. The robo

was revealed in outline for a 
brief second, as a writhing illu- 
niination covered it. It relaxed 
its grip on Robin and fell. 

“I’m terribly sorry about 
that,” Gina said, clinging to 
him. “I should have guessed that 
they’d get after me as well as you 
when your mother was discov- 
ered. I’ve been careless. Since 
the mindless fools were ex- 
pecting only me, they sent only 
one robofficer for me. We’d bet- 
ter move before more come.” 
“What did you do to him?” 
Robin asked as they stepped over 
the metal hulk. 

“A sort of gun that really 
works. They don’t make them in 
this city. But they do where I 
come from.” 

“Hag’s sake, Gina, where do 
you come from?” 

“Where we’re going to, fast!” 
In the kitchen, she shut the 
door and switched on the light, 
grumbling because the windows 
of the city did not have curtains. 

Outside, with its blood-separ- 
ating screech, the Dark Thing 
sailed over again. It was close, 
but Robin paid no attention. 
Gina was opening up her refuse 
well. Behind the disposal chute, 
the regulation pattern had been 
altered. The rotor that mashed 
the refuse as it went down had 
been removed. A metal ladder 
hung into the depths. Inside the 
door, a torch dangled. Gina took 



it and climbed through the 
hatch onto the ladder. 

‘Tollow me, and be sure to 
close the hatch behind you. 
There’s a stout bolt on this side.” 
“What are we going down in- 
to the Services for?” 

“Oh, hurry, Robin, hurry!” 
Reluctantly, he climbed into 
the well. As he did so, there 
came a knocking at the front 
door of the house, a knocking 
that changed into a pounding. 
As he slammed the hatch to, he 
heard a door panel splinter. He 
climbed hurriedly down into 
the depths, preceded by the jigg- 
ing circle of Gina’s torchlight. 




had happened to the Services, 
and realized that the concrete 
beyond the ladder was new; they 
had bypassed the Services level 
They could only be going to one 
place. 

“Steady now,” she cautioned. 

He came down and stood be- 
side her as she fumbled with a 
lock. 

“Wait a moment,” he said, 
grasping her hand. She turned 
to see his face shining with 
sweat His chest heaved as he 
forced the words out, “I know 
where we are — it’s the ground 
outside, isn’t it? I can’t go out 
there. I’ll see you out, then I’ll 
go back upstairs to face — ” 



114 



GALAXY 



She broke in, “I can’t leave 
you now. Get a grip of yourself 
and come on.” 

“No, you don’t understand! It 
may be true, all you say about 
our having been taught a lot of 
superstition, but you don’t 
just throw off a lifetime’s habit 
in one go.” 

“You do if you’re determined 
enough. Listen, even today the 
centuries when man was a crea- 
ture living on the edge of end- 
less forests and jungles is not far 
enough behind him. We never 
managed to throw off the super- 
stitions of those times before we 
took to building our own jimgle- 
substitutes, the cities. So as well 
as being centers of civilization, 
they’ve always been centers of 
ignorance and fear as well. The 
greatest cities in the world have 
sheltered more savages than sa- 
vants. This city has no savants! 
It’s a stone and steel jungle, and 
you’re a savage. Choose! Are you 
going back into the trees or out 
into the light with me?” 

As he stood there, a series of 
blows soimded from above their 
heads. The robos were breaking 
in the kitchen hatch. 

Robin laughed hoarsely. “It 
seems I’m on your side.” 

Distantly over their heads, a 
light showed. He knew then how 
far they had climbed. They 
would be on the ground now . 
A searchlight flashed on from 



above; at the same time, Gina 
had the lock open and they tum- 
bled out into darkness. 

■f T^en vision returned to 
~ ^ his eyes, Robin saw they 
were indeed on the ground. 

It was not as he had imagined 
it. The dark made it a terrifying 
world in two tones of black. 
Massive pillars and strute and 
cross girders bit a confusing pat- 
tern out of the sky. They stum- 
bled over uneven ground littered 
with stone and the occasional 
trench. A wind blew, hooking 
bits of paper out of the shadow 
and back, in a lunatic chase. 
Robin thought of the white 
things he had seen moving from 
Dunshinnan Bridge. Instinctive- 
ly he looked up. The black mon- 
ster of the dty crouched over 
them, huge and cruel and sense- 
less as an ancient curse. 

He tripped and fell. 

“I’ve got a half - track parked 
where it’s smoother,” Gina said. 
“Don’t keep falling over.” 

He had hurt his shin and] 
was angry. Broken ground was a] 
new experience. 

“Why don’t you put your 
damned torch, on?” 

“Because there’s someone or 
something ahead.” 

They moved round a massive 
leg of _ metal. Out in the open, 
crouched on the rough ground, 
was a machine, with two robos 



JUNGLE SUBSTITUTE

near it. Gradually, the two hu- 
mans distinguished between 
shadow and substance. Rob- 
in felt his legs shake. 

“It’s the Dark Thing!” he 
whispered. There it lay, its red 
eyes closed. 

“They’re waiting till it’s time 
to do another circuit of the city. 
And they’re in our way. Oh, 
Robin, and I’ve got lost ... I 
can’t remember where I parked 
the half-track. Perhaps it was 
the other side. All this darkness 
— it’s so confusing!” 

She began to weep. He held 
her, confused and yet grati- 
fied by her weakness. Her sobs 
sounded horribly loud. He 
stared out at the Dark Thing 
with a dry mouth, watching to 
see if the robos had heard any- 
thing. Then a stab of light from' 
behind made him turn. 

The pursuit had climbed 
down the well from Gina’s house 
and was looking for them. One, 
two, three heavy robos appeared, 
flashing their lights among the 
superstructure of city supports. 

The robos by the Dark Thing 
began signalling and calling to 
the newcomers. There was 
a swift exchange of calls, and 
they began to join forces. Mak- 
ing a dash for it, Gina and Rob- 
in jumped behind a buttress. A 
shout rose as they went. 

“They’ve seen us! We’ll never 
get away,” Gina said. 



“Wait!” He looked cautious- 
ly round the buttress. The robos 
had their backs turned. Their 
lights shone through a maze of 
girders onto a vehicle. He pulled 
Gina up. “That’s what they’re 
shouting about. Is that your 
car?” 

She nodded. 

“There’s a chance, Robin. Fol- 
low me.” 

She was running out into the 
open. He followed without hesi- 
tation; he had to be with her. 
They ran out towards the Dark 
Thing. 

He was not afraid. If robos 
worked it, it was another ma- 
chine. 

I t was bigger than he had 
expected. They pulled up 
together, sheltered under one 
wing from the robos now exam- 
ining her vehicle. 

“Can you work this thing?” he 
asked. It was half a prayer. 
“Now’s my chance to leam.” 
“Good girl!” 

They scrambled into a roomy 
cabin, sat on unpadded seats be- 
fore a control board that meant 
nothing to him. She worked 
switches. Lights came on. Motors 
roared, died, burst into full life. 

“Hold tight!” she called, but 
they were already tipping up- 
wards. He caught a last glimpse 
of their pursuers, galloping out 
towards them. Horribly near. 



116 



GALAXY 



the lip of the city came up, 
black and ponderous, then they 
saw the city itself, canting at an 
angle, a tangle of light and dark, 
a smaller place than he knew, a 
place it was very easy to escape 
from. 

She was laughing, and he en- 
joyed the sight of it. 

Above the noise, she" shouted, 

“One last scare for them 
— I can’t switch the banshee si- 
ren off!” 

“Why do they need all this 
spook apparatus?” he yelled. “If 
they don’t want man, why don’t 
they — just wipe him out?” 

“They need men! They need 



us, Robin! They can’t do with- 
out us the way we can do with- 
out them. We may be redundant 
in the city, but in the world, 
they are redundant. You shall 
see — we’re heading for my city, 
where robos are back in their 
proper place.” 

She said something else more 
gently, so that he could not hear 
for the noise. 

“What did you say?” 

Again he missed her shouted 
reply. Only her smile was clear 
as they sped over the featureless 
plain, howling like a banshee all 
the way.

THE 

WATCHERS 
IN THE 
GLADE 

BY RICHARD WILSON 



Illustrated by GAUGHAN 

If wasn't a bad planet. 

The food was good — once 
you managed to eat iU 



N evins, who had been iU, 
did not rejoin the others 
for nearly two weeks after they 
had been cast away by the muti- 
neers. It was dusk when he 
walked into the glade of flame- 
colored grass where they had de- 
cided to wait. Jeffries was the 
only one to greet him. 

“HeUo, Nevins,” he said. “Go- 
ing to be part of the happy 



group, are you? How’s the 
fever?” 

“Gone, I guess. But I still feel 
lightheaded.” 

Jeffries laughed. “So do we 
all. It’s something in the atmo- 
sphere of this bloody planet 
Well, pick yourself a spot. One’s 
as good as another.” 

Nevins looked around. There 
was no hut or lean-to, or even 
bedding. “Where do you sleep?” 
he asked. 



118 




Jeffries laughed again, with 
little humor. “You’ve been 
sleeping? You’re the lucky one. 
We don’t sleep, friend.’’ 

“They had me doped up. I 
guess I was out most of the time. 
You mean you can’t sleep?’’ 
“Can’t — and don’t need to,” 
Jeffries said. “It’s the atmo- 
sphere, old boy. Something in it. 
But nothing to knit up the old 
raveled sleave. Damn nuisance, 
of course, but there it is. We’re 
the original lively four. Five, 
now you’re here.” 

“Nobody looks very lively,” 
Nevins said. 

Cadman, who was closest to 
them, sat crosslegged in front of 
his portable typewriter, which 
he had propped on top of a flat 
rock. He was pecking "at the keys 
with two fingers, without enthu- 
siasm but steadily. 

“Hello, Cadman,” Nevins 
said. “Working?” 

Cadman looked at him 
with no particular expression. 
“That’s what Interplanetary 
News pays me for,” he said. “I’m 
preparing a dispatch.” 

“I see. That’s the spirit.” 
Cadman brightened a lit- 
tle. “Look, Ralph,” he said. 
“You’ve been away. You can use 
a fill-in. Feel free to look over 
my stuff any time. It wouldn’t 
be right for you to miss out on 
the story just because you’ve 
been sick.” 



“That’s damn nice of you,” 
Nevins said. 

Jeffries said; “Code of the 
journalist, eh, Cadman?” 

“Just the decent thing to do,” 
Cadman said, not looking at 
Jeffries. 

“Thanks, Cadman,” Nevins 
said. “I’ll have a look later.” 

“Okay.” Cadman went back to 
typing. “There’s really no hur- 
ry.” 

Before Jeffries led him away, 
Nevins had a glimpse of the line 
Cadman was typing. It said: 
damn nice code journalist look 
later no hurry 

tt ^adman’s got it all down,” 

^ Jeffries said. “Every jot 
and tittle. Every crashing bore of 
an incident. It’s there for when 
you want it, but you won’t want 
it. He’s crackers, you know.” 

“Crackers?” 

“Nutty as a fruit cake, to use 
your idiom. More so than the 
rest of us.” 

Nevins looked at him closely. 
“Not you,” he said. “Not Justin 
Jeffries of the Daily Mail, dean 
of the British press corps.” He’d 
tried to say it lightly, but it came 
out sounding nasty. He hadn’t 
meant it to; Jeffries was super- 
cilious and full of biting wit but 
there was no malice in him. 

“The same,” said Jeffries, 
who’d apparently taken no of- 
fense. “We’ve all developed our 



120 



GALAXY 



little ways. Just as you will, 
Ralph L. Nevins of Galactic 
News, now that you’re back 
from limbo.” 

“How’s Cindy? She’s a pretty 
level-headed one.” 

Cindy Garth, feature writer 
for World Wide News, wasn’t 
the prettiest girl in the world. 
Few women correspondents were 
externally beautiful. But Cindy 
was intelligent and pleasant and, 
before the mutiny, had been a 
real diplomat as lone woman in 
the ship. She’d earned the re- 
spect of each of her male col- 
leagues, even those she’d had to 
rebuff when they tried too un- 
subtly to be lady-killers. 

Jeffries said: “Want to talk to 
her now, or save it for dessert? 
It may come as a shock.” 

Ralph Nevins hesitated. He 
could see Cindy at the far end 
of the glade. She was perched 
on a hummock, turned half 
away from them, watching the 
sun-moon as it prepared to sink 
behind the dark red ridge across 
the little valley. She looked per- 
fectly normal, almost pretty, in 
the gathering dusk. What could 
be wrong with her? 

Nothing, Ralph decided. 
“Come on; let’s go say hello.” 
Jeffries shrugged. “Hold on 
to your illusions.” 

Cindy Garth looked around 
sharply as they neared. She 
sprang to her feet. 

THE WATCHERS IN THE GUDE 



“Hold!” she cried, fling- 
ing out an imperious arm. 
“None approaches save at our 
bidding.” She glared at them. 
“What seek ye?” 

Ralph turned to the older 
man in dismay. “Whafs hap- 
pened to her?” 

Cindy’s hair was a tangle. She 
wore no makeup. Her clothing 
was rumpled. Nevertheless her 
carriage was erect and her gaze 
haughty. 

“She’s Queen of the May,” 
Jeffries said. “Or perhaps Cath- 
erine the Great. Had enough for 
now?” 

Yes. I’ll talk to her when 
I’m stronger.” 

They turned away. Cindy 
went back to her hummock, 
muttering. It sounded as if she 
were saying, “ . respect for our 
sovereign person.” 

\ s they headed back toward 
the center of the darkening 
glade Hunter, the fifth in their 
group, jogged past them around 
the perimeter. His head was 
flung back and his eyes ap- 
peared to be closed. He held his 
hands in fists, close to his chest, 
and trotted soundlessly around a 
narrow track which had been 
worn into the yellow - orange 
grass. He was breathing in a 
deep, controlled rhythm. 

“What’s he doing?” Ralph 
asked. 



121 



“Working himself up to it” 
“To what? I’d say hello, but 
he looks as if he doesn’t want 
anybody to bother him.” 

“He wouldn’t talk to you now. 
Afterwards, maybe.” 

“After what?” 

“Let’s see if we can fine you 
a hummock to call your own,” 
Jeffries said. ‘We may not sleep, 
but we can’t stand up all night 
like bloody horses, either.” 

The sun-moon touched the 
rim of the horizon and seemed 
to spread its softly silver lumi- 
nescence along the edge of it, as 
if it were an egg yolk accommo- 
dating itself to the flatness of a 
pan. Then it was sucked under 
the rim, leaving the sky dark but 
with fiery streaks at one of the 
bottom edges of its inverted 
bowl. 

Then the moon-moon rose, in 
almost the exact place where the 
sun-moon had srt, and, on a far 
ridge between it and the glade, 
some figures began to move back 
and forth in a curious, jerky 
way. 

They were at such a distance 
that it was hard to judge their 
size, but Ralph imagined they 
were about as big as wolves. 

They traveled in a kind of me- 
chanical lope, moving in one di- 
rection for several seconds, then 
halting with a jerk and going 
in the opposite way. They were 
little more than silhouettes at 

122 



this distance, and to Ralph they 
looked like cookie-cutter figures 
being manipulated by a child in 
the beam of a projector. They 
constantly moved back and 
forth, crisscrossing, perhaps 
even swinging around one an- 
other the way people did at a 
bam dance. 

Then another image came in- 
to Ralph’s mind, that of a crack- 
the-whip at a carnival, where 
each car was sent speeding in 
one direction and then was 
whipped around as it reached 
the end of its mechanical tether. 

But that was still not right 
The word “wolves” came back 
into his mind, without reason. 

Jeffries had paused and 
watched with him. “Hstj- 
notic spectacle, isn’t it? For 
some reason, undoubtedly psy- 
chological, everybody calls them 
the wolves. Yet they don’t look a 
bit like wolves, do they?” He 
watched them for a while long- 
er, then turned away and said 
abruptly: “Besides, there aren’t 
any animals on this planet Ex- 
cept for us.” 

II 

T iey had never learned the 
name of the leader of the 
mutiny aboard the man o’ war 
Patton. Nor were the correspon- 
dents able to learn the reason 
for it Only two ship’s officers 

GALAXY 



were spared — Captain Brian 
Larcom and Lieutenant John 
Raney, the medics — and neither 
would discuss it. 

The uprising had been carried 
out swiftly early one morning 
(ship’s time) as the Patton sped 
in tertiary max. toward a ren- 
dezvous with the remnants of a 
beleaguered Earth fleet, a speci- 
fied number of parsecs from 
Barnard’s Oph. 

Nevins had heard one scream. 
When he dragged himself out of 
his cabin, feverish and half 
asleep, a mutineer prodded him 
toward the lounge. The other 
four correspondents were al- 
ready there, herded into a cor- 
ner under a diorama of Paris-be- 
fore-the-bomb. Even Justin Jeff- 
ries had lost some of his imper- 
turbability, possibly due to the 
fact that he hadn’t been allowed 
to dress except for a robe over 
his pajamas. 

There had been a gidfly mo- 
ment as the ship came to a stop, 
ending the flutter-in-the-stom- 
ach of tertiary max. which they 
had almost come to accept as 
normal. 

There had been some whisper- 
ing among the mutineers. Then 
Cindy Garth screamed. She’d 
had a glimpse through a port of 
the bodies of the murdered offi- 
cers, in orbit anound the Patton. 

The apparent leader of the 
uprising, a gaunt, middle-aged 

THE WATCHERS IN THE GLADE 



man with a terrible scar over his 
left eye, spoke. 

“We’ve got nothing against 
you,” he said. “There’s a planet 
on the chart where we’ll drop 
you and the two medics who 
didn’t want to throw in with 
us.” 

“I’ll go with you,” one of the 
correspondents said to the mu- 
tineer chief. 

He was Ramsey Hunter, a 
lean, unfriendly war correspon- 
dent whose reputation had been 
made because he happened to 
be in the right place to dash to 
the Sinkiang border to report 
that short-lived, accidental Sino- 
Soviet war in which a million 
men and women died in three 
days because of a misunderstood 
order from either Moscow or 
Peking. Had it not been for 
Hunter, the rest of the world 
might never have heard about 
the terrible conflict. Had it not 
been for his dispatches, there 
might not have been those basic 
changes in east-west diplomacy 
which brought some sense to a 
world which had been on the 
lip of the pit of disaster. 

No one knew then, of course, 
that soon a united Earth would 
face interplanetary disaster. 

Hunter, who was only 28, had 
been hired away from his news 
agency and was now a rove-at- 
Will syndicated war correspon- 
dent for Trans- Universe Fea- 



123 



tures. He claimed he had a Chi- 
nese bullet in his left arm and a 
piece of Russian shrapnel in his 
right leg. Though he never men- 
tioned them except in print, his 
scars had been plain to see 
when he went for a swim at Wal- 
lops Island before the Patton 
leapt away to fling itself across 
six light-years to the vicinity of 
Barnard’s Oph, to fight the war 
of the particles. 

So Ramsey Hunter naturally 
said to the mutineers that he 
would join them, in a pro- 
fessional capacity, of course. 
There would be many a column 
in the experience, and probably 
a better chance of getting back 
to Earth. 

“No, you won’t,” the mutineer 
chief said. “We’re taking our 
own and nobody else. This is a 
nice uninhabited planet we 
picked out for you. It’s got air 
and everything.” He had a sense 
of humor, of a kind, this scarred 
mutineer. 

“But that’s inhuman!” Arthur 
Cadman said. “Who would ever 
find us?” 

“Nobody, maybe. On the oth- 
er hand, if we get where we’re 
going, and if we feel like it, we’ll 
send a message to Earth and tell 
them where you are. If you co- 
operate and don’t make any 
trouble, that is.” 

“I don’t think we can ask for 
more than that,” Justin Jeffries 

124 



said, with a glance at the bod- 
ies circling outside against the 
unfamiliar sky. The mutineers 
could easily add five more gris- 
ly satellites. Or four more, keep- 
ing Cindy for themselves. 

No, it would be best to take 
what was offered and to ask no 
questions, such as what the mu- 
tiny had been about. 

“Very sensible, Mr. Jeff- 
ries,” the chief mutineer told 
him. “Now you pioneers go back 
to your cabins and pack what 
you want to. Stay there till we 
let you know. It’ll be a few hours 
yet before we get you to your 
new home.” 

T he warm climate, where the 
temperature did not vary by 
a degree day or night, and the 
lack of rain made shelter un- 
necessary. 

Captain Larcom and Lieuten- 
ant Raney, the medics, had built 
a chemical privy near the little 
house they put up. 

The mutineers had let them 
have pre-formed material out of 
the stores. The mutineers also 
had left enough material for each 
of the correspondents to have 
built himself a fair-sized hut, had 
he wished to. But none had. Per- 
haps if Cindy Garth had singled 
out one of them there would 
have been some carpentry. But 
with the medics’ toilet available 
to all and with Cindy gone mad. 



GALAXY 



there was no need for building. 
Nothing went up in the glade. 

The medics had put up their 
place in a smaller clearing be- 
hind a low hill and out of sight 
of the glade. They called it a dis- 
pensary. It actually had served 
as a hospital for Ralph Nevins 
until he recovered from his 
fever. 

But Jeffries called it the fairy 
palace. He was positive that 
Captain Larcom and Lieutenant 
Raney were homosexuals and 
that they had built their dispen- 
sary not because they were 
concerned about the health of 
their fellow castaways but be- 
cause they were the only two 
people on the planet who were 
having any kind of sexual rela- 
tions. 

“I have no proof,” Jeffries 
told Ralph. “It could be just my 
nasty mind. You spent a fort- 
night there. In your lucid mo- 
ments, how did they strike you?” 

Ralph shrugged. “There’s 
nothing overt about them, but 
there are signs, if they mean 
anything: the fussy way they 
fight with each other, for one 
thing.” 

“You don’t mean physically 
fight?” 

“No; I mean argue. It’s a pet- 
ty sort of contradiction — or a 
vying for superlatives. It’s as if 
one of them said he had once 
treated a very difficult case of 



double pneumonia and the oth- 
er had to say he’d once had a 
terrible case of triple pneumo- 
nia.” 

“I see. A sort of one-upman- 
ship — over nothing.” 

“Over nothing important, any- 
way,” Ralph said. 

“And the kiss-and-make-up 
went on out of sight.” 

“If there was any. We’re just 
guessing, aren’t we?” 

“Gossiping, I’d call it. But 
there’s nothing much else to do, 
is there? Not until mealtime, 
anyway.” 

“When is mealtime?” 
“Whenever Hunter gets 
back,” Jeffries said. 

“Back from where?” 

“It’s interesting how we’ve ad- 
justed to eating only one meal a 
day. Like the family dog.” 
Ralph said: “This is the sec- 
ond time you’ve evaded one of 
my questions about what Hunt- 
er goes out for. Why?” 

“Why have I evaded your 
question? I’ll keep on evading 
for a while.” 

T>y then it was dark, or as 
^ dark as it ever got. Hunter, 
who all this time had been jog- 
ging aroimd the track, increased 
his pace for a final lap, then 
sped away from the glade until 
he disappeared among the tall, 
toad-stool-shaped trees. 

Arthur Cadman, whose typing 

125 



THE WATCHERS IN THE GLADE 



had finally stopped, though ear- 
lier it had continued despite the 
gathering gloom; 

Cindy Garth, wary-eyed and 
aloof, but obviously in need, 
now, of having people around 
her; 

Lieutenant John Raney, a 
thin man, apparently in his late 
twenties, whose hair was rapidly 
turning gray; 

Captain Brian Larcom, a 
once-trim figure in his early for- 
ties who was now beginning to 
bulge above the belt and below 
the chin; and 

Justin Jeffries, who led Ralph 
Nevins to the center of the glade 
as if initiating him into a rite. 

The medics arrived in single 
file, several feet apart, from out 
of the toadstool wood beyond 
the circular glade of grass. The 
glade had lost its yellow-orange 
daytime fire and was now the 
color of a steak which had lain 
too long in the supermarket 
freezer-shelf. 

No one spoke. They arranged 
themselves on hummocks, almost 
ceremoniously, facing the far- 
off rise where the silhouetted 
figures persisted in their silent, 
tireless dance. Ralph, his ques- 
tions hushed by the obvious so- 
lemnity of the occasion, sat 
down where Jeffries indicated 
he should. 

The moon-moon had risen 
just so far over the horizon and 



hovered there, concentrical- 
ly ringed, like a thin onion-slice 
in the dark sky. 

The far-off stage was filled 
vnth ever-changing shapes. Oc- 
casionally, although the move- 
ments of the figures had to be 
purely random, Ralph was 
tempted to ascribe rational mo- 
tives to them. 

Even as a dedicated sky- 
watcher must inevitably find 
meaning in a cloud-shape, so did 
Ralph find significance in the 
motions of these others with 
whom he and his fellow cast- 
aways shared the planet. 

And as they watched — intent, 
involved, apprehensive, fear- 
ful — a new figure appeared at 
the left of the double-moon-illu- 
minated stage. It was Ramsey 
Hunter, instantly recogniz- 
able. But then, as Hunter’s pres- 
ence made itself felt, the move- 
ments of the others on the stage, 
heretofore calm and ordered, if 
swift, became frenzied and fran- 
tic, as if menace had entered 
from the wings. 

Then Ralph noticed Cindy. 
As Hunter joined the group 
across the valley and became one 
of the silhouettes, Cindy became 
less aloof. Her hands began to 
flutter, to her hair, to her face, 
to her breast. 

Cadman, who was sitting near 
Cindy, watched her with con- 
cern. He moved closer and then. 



126 



GALAXY 



tentatively, fearfully, not look- 
ing at her, he stretched out a 
hand to her, ready to withdraw 
it instantly if it were rebuffed. 

But it was not rebuffed. It was 
ignored for a time; then Cindy 
reached out, without looking, 
and grasped Cadman’s hand 
and clung to it as she watched 
the distant tableau. 

O alph looked away to the 
others. Larcom and Raney, 
who had entered the glade so 
conspicuously apart, were sitting 
on a hummock. As Hunter ap- 
peared on the ridge they moved 
closer together, as if in fear. 
Then slowly, unconsciously per- 
haps, Larcom’s right hand 
reached out and gripped Raney’s 
left and they clung to each oth- 
er, their eyes fixed on the drama 
being enacted on the far ridge. 

Justin Jeffries, having brought 
Ralph to the center, sat apart 
from him. Jeffries watched as 
intently as any of the others, but 
seemingly wi&out the need for 
another’s support. Yet toward 
the end of the drama he too had 
become tensely involved. As he 
watched, his right hand made a 
fist and slowly bored into his left 
palm. 

Ralph, not knowing what any 
of this meant, was less personal- 
ly involved, though the obvious 
emotion of the others was affect- 
ing him. His realization that the 

THE WATCHERS IN THE GLADE 



others were being so profoundly 
moved made him seek harder for 
clues to what was really happen- 
ing on the ridge where Ramsey 
Hunter and the other silhouett- 
ed creatures were acting out 
their macabre ballet. 

Those others on the stage-like 
ridge now drew away from 
Hunter as if he were contamin- 
ated. It was as if those who ap- 
proached Hunter from the right 
did so with the greatest reluc- 
tance. But approach they must, 
Ralph thought, because they 
were on a treadmill. No, not so 
much a treadmill as one of those 
little hand-cranked merry-go- 
rounds you used to see in the 
city, on the back of a truck, 
where the horses and swans and 
ostriches moved with strobo- 
scopic haltingness both from left 
to right and right to left. All that 
was lacking was the music, the 
imitation-calliope sound. 

While the figures approaching 
Hunter did so haltingly — fear- 
fully? — those fleeing from him 
went in a wild plunge, as if 
strung on elastic, almost as if ex- 
ultant at having been spared. 

The weird dance became even 
more frenzied. It must have 
been Ralph’s delusion but Hunt- 
er, the hunter, had become 
shninken and had assumed the 
shape of a wolf. Or had he mere- 
ly dropped down on all fours? 
But at the same time the oth- 

127 I 



ers — the hunter’s prey — 
became human-shaped. Their 
scissorwork outlines took on the 
forms of full, rounded men and 
women. They grew arms and legs 
of the most astonishing realism. 
With the legs they sought hope- 
lessly to run from this alien 
creature intent on their destruc- 
tion. 

But their legs were chained to 
the eternally revolving central 
mechanism. There was nowhere 
they could go except to cower 
away from their himter as they 
were drawn toward him and 
then to fling themselves away as 
soon as they were able. 

With their arms they gestured 
to each other and to their foe, 
making plain their fear and dis- 
gust. They did not hold each 
other’s hands nor did they 
strike out against the wolf-shape 
of the hunter who menaced 
them. Their arms appeared de- 
signed less for offense or self- 
defense than to express their 
otherwise unvoicable emotions 
— their terror at being attacked 
by this alien creature. 

The faces of the hunted could 
not be distinguished, but there 
was enough in the way they 
turned their heads, this way or 
that, or held them at an angle, 
to persuade Ralph that only in- 
telligence could have directed 
such movements. 

It was appalling to watch, 



therefore, as the wolf-shaped 
creature Ralph knew to be a hu- 
man being crept ever closer to 
the terrified pack of tethered 
human-seeming beings. 

The tableau became a silent 
crescendo of agonized movement 
as the hunter reached slowly into 
their midst and came away with 
the one he had chosen. 

Ill 

I t had been done so quickly, 
after the ritualistic prelimi- 
nary, that Ralph almost missed 
it. He had expected to see Hunt- 
er re-assume human form and 
strike with a knife, with a dra- 
matic upflung and downthrust 
arm. But Hunter attacked from 
near the ground and used no 
weapon that Ralph could see. 

The one taken from the midst 
of the others threw up its arms 
in one final hopeless gesture. Its 
head went back on its neck in a 
silent scream of despair. Then it 
withered. It simply collapsed 
and was borne away across the 
shoulder of the man who had 
now risen to his full human 
height. 

A great sigh, whether of relief 
or shame Ralph could not tell, 
rose from the watchers in the 
glade. Ralph himself felt chiefly 
release from tension. The others 
had not sighed in unison, but 
each individual sigh had been of 



128 



GALAXY 



such duration that at one point 
they had blended into a unified 
expression of group emotion. 

As the hunter left the distant 
stage with his kill the dancers 
on that knoll returned to the 
measured round in which they 
had been peacefully engaged be- 
fore the stranger joined the 
scene. 

Now that this act of the drama 
had ended, those in the glade 
drew apart. Cindy Garth 
dropped Arthur Cadman’s hand 
with an expression of distaste 
and retired to a separate hum- 
mock. Cadman looked after her 
for a moment, then took a small 
notebook from his pocket and 
began to write busily, bending 
close to the page so he could see 
in the dimness. 

Larcom and Raney unclasped 
hands and self-consciously with- 
drew to opposite sides of the 
same hummock, where each sat 
stiffly upright. 

Justin Jeffries, the cool one, 
stopped turning his fist in palm 
and stood up, thrusting hands 
into pants pockets. He looked at 
Ralph, who shook his head and 
gave a smile of no meaning. 

Jeffries walked to Ralph’s 
hummock. He said with forced 
lightness: “What do you think 
of our amateur theatricals?’’ 

Ralph, putting his voice to- 
gether, said: “You sound like the 
actor who asked Mrs. Lincoln 

THE WATCHERS IN THE GLADE 



how she liked the show. I 
thought it was horrible, 
of course.” 

He saw Cadman cock an ear 
toward them, then write in his 
notebook, nose almost touching 
a page. Ralph could image him 
putting down: Lincoln theater 
horrible of course . 

“Of course,” Jeffries said. “But 
fascinating, too, you must ad- 
mit. You wouldn’t think the 
same routine could hold an au- 
dience night after night, but it 
does. The same audience, need- 
less to say.” 

“You mean it’s always Hunter 
who goes out?” 

“He’s a volunteer. Never mind 
now. Here comes the killer with 
his kill.” 

Hunter strode into the glade 
with some awful thing over his 
shoulder. 

O amsey Hunter, chronicler of 
wars, castaway of fate, killer 
of aliens, strode into the glade 
with a confident step and a proud 
bearing. He went directly to 
Cindy Garth and kneeled before 
her. 

“I have returned, O my Queen, 
with food for your subjects,” he 
said. His expression was a mix- 
ture of haughtiness and mock 
servility, overshadowed by a 
look which laughed at everyone 
and everything. 

Cindy ignored the look, if she 

129 



saw it, and stood. She stretdied 
out a tentative hand which did 
not quite touch Hunter on the 
forehead. “Rise, mighty hunter,” 
she said. “Thou hast done well.” 

Hunter rose and tossed down 
the thing he had been carrying. 

Ralph djdn’t know what he 
had expected — perhaps a clat- 
ter of skeletal bones or the thud 
of a body. What he heard was 
the faintest rustle, as if Hunter 
had dropped an autumn corn- 
stalk. And when he looked he 
saw a leafy bundle, a sheaf, 
hose plucking would have been 
no more traumatic than the 
picking of an apple. 

“Will Your Highness honor 
me by accepting the first of the 
servings?” Hunter asked. 

“We accept,” Cindy said and. 
Hunter leaned down and broke 
off a piece. It was about as long 
as a leg of lamb and not quite 
as thick. 

Cindy grabbed it out of his 
hand and ran to her place at the 
edge of the glade, calling over 
her shoulder: “Serve the others, 
mighty hunter, and thyself.” 

Hunter reached down again 
and broke off a piece which he 
put in his pocket. Then he beck- 
oned to the medics, who seemed 
the most eager to be fed. Cindy 
had seemed more eager to leave 
them than to eat. 

Larcom and Raney accepted 
the portion Hunter tore off for 

130 



them, then went off beyond the 
glade to their infirmary 
(or fairy palace), Larcom first 
and Raney carrying the food. 
No words were exchanged. 

Cadman was the next to go up. 
Hunter, a benevolent smile on 
his lips, waited for him to ap- 
proach. Ralph, watching, thought 
of Hunter as heir apparent and 
wondered how he would treat 
poor Cadman as he claimed his 
pound of grain, or whatever the 
stuff was that lay, inert, on the 
ground. 

To Ralph’s surprise. Hunter 
(Hunter the hunter, dispenser of 
life) treated Cadman very de- 
cently. “How are you, Cad- 
man?” he said. “Everything all 
right?” 

“Fine, Hunter,” Cadman said. 
“I’m keeping it up to date.” 

“That’s the way,” Hunter said. 
“Take some chow so you’ll have 
the strength for it.” He put a 
piece in Cadman’s pocket 
“Here, have another little some- 
thing for later, in case you get 
bogged down in the middle of 
the night while you’re doing the 
history. It’s amazing how a little 
something to nibble on stimu- 
lates the creative juices.” 

“Thank you,” Cadman said 
gravely. “Having been a writer 
yourself. Hunter, you un- 
derstand our problems. I appre- 
ciate that” 

“Quite,” Hunter said, equally 
GALAXY 



grave. “Carry on, Cadman, and 
remember the old precept: Nev- 
er mind the facts, but be sure 
you spell the names right.” He 
kept an absolutely straight face. 

A little frown appeared on 
Cadman’s forehead. He said: 
“Forgive me for asking, but is it 
Hunter with a capital H or is it 
small-h hunter? I mean • in the 
generic sense. I do get confused.” 
And Hunter said, again more 
kindly than Ralph would have 
expected: “It depends entirely 
on your point of view, Arthur. 
You’re the historian; you’re He- 
rodotus, you’re Toynbee. And the 
historian is the referee. Call ’em 
as you see ’em, Arthur, and 
damn the dissenters.” 

Cadman, his notebook out, 
as busy recording it all, his 
face close to the paper, as he 
backed away from Hunter, the 
man on the Queen’s hummock; 
Hunter, the acting chief. 

’^hen it was Justin Jeffries’ 
turn. Jeffries went with a 
combination of bravado and sub- 
servience, a mingling of defiance 
and dependence. He said: “Hail, 
Chief. Congratulations on a suc- 
cessful hunt. What can I, your 
humble servant, do for you?” 
Hunter regarded him coldly. 
“You can hunt in my place to- 
morrow night. How would that 
suit you, wise guy?” 

“Perfectly,” Jeffries re- 



plied. “I’ve offered before, you 
remember, but you’ve never ac- 
cepted.” 

“You’d willing go?” Hunter 
asked, as if in disbelief. “You’d 
risk the perils, the psychic ter- 
rors?” 

“Ah, bull,” Jeffries said. “It’s 
not so terrible as all that. I par- 
ticularly want to put my offer 
on the record because we have a 
new arrival today: Ralph 

Nevins.” 

“I am glad to welcome him,” 
Hunter said. “Out of courtesy to 
him I overlook all the ways you 
have attempted to subvert my 
authority and belittle my 
achievement.” 

Ralph, who had drawn close 
to the two, said: “Surely Hunt- 
er hasn’t forgotten that we were 
all together aboard the Patton.” 
“I’m afraid he has,” Jeffries 
replied under his breath. “He’s 
completely absorbed in this he- 
roic drama he’s playing. Try him 
out if you like.” 

“I will.” Ralph thought for a 
moment while Hunter stared 
coldly at Jeffries. Then he said: 
“Hunter, what do you plan to do 
when the rescue ship comes?” 
Hunter went into the first per- 
son plural, as if Cindy no long- 
er existed, and said: “Our fealty 
is to our subjects. Naturally we 
shall stay here with them.” 
Jeffries put left ear to left 
shoulder and rolled his eyeballs 



THE WATCHERS IN THE GUDE 



131 



up as if to say: You see? Com- 
pletely mad. 

“Enough of this empty talk,” 
Hunter said. “Here is your 
share, Jeffries, and yours, Nev- 
ins. Now get thee hence, that 
the hunter may enjoy what is 
left to himself, before the great 
sleep descends.” 

Ralph watched Hunter detach 
a piece which he handed to Jeff- 
ries. He gave another to Ralph 
and stuffed what was left under 
his arm and loped off to the 
edge of the glade, halfway be- 
tween Cindy and Cadman. 

Ralph told Jeffries; “He talks 
like a cross between the King 
James version and Edgar Rice 
Burroughs.” 

“Really?” Jeffries said with a 
minimum of interest now that 
dinner had been served. “I’m 
hungry, so I suggest you go and 
eat, privately, while I do the 
same. Don’t be self-con- 
scious. No one will watch.” 

As Ralph hesitated. Jeffries, 
though, obviously anxious to go, 
took the time to say; “What 
you’ve got to understand is that 
they’re vegetables.” 

“I know that, I suppose.” 
“Well, you have no compimc- 
tions about digging up a potato, 
have you? And then plucking 
out its eyes and boiling it in wa- 
ter, or baking it in its skin, and 
then eating it? Same thing. Only 
these are mobile vegetables.” 



“But they’re shaped like peo- 
ple.” 

“So’s a gingerbread man. 
You’ve got to be realistic. The 
only other stuff that grows here 
is impossible. It has no nourish- 
ment and it makes you sick. 

“Maybe we could build up an 
immunity to it.” 

“Don’t think we haven’t tried. 
It’s like eating a poison ivy sal- 
ad.” 

Saying no more, Jeffries went 
off to his own hummock, clutch- 
ing the meal that Hunter had 
given him. 

R alph, after a moment’s 
hesitation, took his share 
and v/ent to his own place, near 
the perimeter. 

There, sitting beside his hum- 
mock, which so accommodating- 
ly fitted its edge to the back of 
his neck, Ralph examined his 
ration. 

It was less ominous than he 
had feared. There was nothing 
about it that was the least like 
flesh. Relieved, Ralph broke off 
a piece. It caused him no more 
pain than it would to snap a 
bread stick. 

It was crisp, like celery. It had 
separated cleanly, with no 
bleeding or any other indica- 
t-on that it might once 
have been flesh. Grateful for 
this, Ralph looked to see what 
the others were doing. 



132 



GALAXY 



Cindy Garth was eating as if 
there might never be tomorrow, 
cramming food into her mouth 
in an orgy of self-gratification. 
Ralph stared at her for a time 
but she either did not see him 
or chose to ignore him. 

His gaze went next to Arthur 
Cadman, the fortunate one who 
had held the Queen’s hand and 
who had been spoken civilly to 
by Hunter. But Cadman was 
even less responsive. He had eyes 
for nothing but his journal. He 
wrote steadily, a pencil in his 
right hand and his eyes close to 
the page, his left hand only oc- 
casionally bringing a bite 

of supper to his mouth. 

Ralph looked next to Jeffries, 
a dozen feet away. Jeffries, for- 
mer man-about-London, so- 

phisticate, sometimes adviser of 
prime ministers, was so en- 
grossed in his meal that Ralph, 
shocked, looked away quickly. 
At the moment there was noth- 
ing to be learned from Jeffries 
except gluttony. 

Ralph turned finally to study 
the hunter himself, Ramsey 
Hunter. 

Hunter was eating like a gour- 
met, choosing a bit of this, a 
trifle of that, wiping his lips with 
a handkerchief and then nibbling 
again, unhurriedly. It was a 
bravura performance, like his 
earlier one on the knoll across 
the valley, none the less polished 



now that Ralph Nevins was the 
sole member of the audience. 

But then, for no apparent rea- 
son, Hunter clutched his belly, 
groaned and ran. Like anyone 
who is about to vomit, he head- 
ed away from his fellow crea- 
tures. He went a little beyond 
the perimeter and stood there, 
facing out from them, his body 
heaving as his stomach worked 
to rid itself of that which of- 
fended it. 

To Ralph, who had not yet 
eaten, this was a discouraging 
sight. If the great hunter could 
not stomach his own provender, 
who else could be expected to? 

Ouddenly Ralph had no ap- 
petite. He took his share to 
Cadman. (His first impulse had 
been to go to Jeffries, but Jeff- 
ries’ gluttony had disgusted 
him.) Cadman looked up from 
his notebook and said : 
“Thanks.” 

“Does Hunter always get sick 
like that?” Ralph asked. 

“Always when it’s his turn.” 

“You mean others have been 
out? Hunter talked as if he was 
the only one.” 

“Oh, no,” Cadman said; 
“we’ve all been out. Hunter’s 
just going through one of his he- 
roic moods. Then it’ll be up to 
Jeffries or me — or you.” He 
smiled at Ralph. “You thought I 
was crazy, didn’t you? I suppose 



THE WATCHERS IN THE GLADE 



133 



I am, in a way. But not as crazy 
as some. Poor Cindy, for in- 
stance, is worse off by far. And 
Jeffries — I really feel sorry for 
him. He can’t eat at all when 
he’s the hunter and he tries to 
make up for it by stuffing him- 
self when somebody else has 
gone out.” 

Ralph looked at Cadman 
through new eyes. "You've been 
out?” he said. “By yourself?” 
“Certainly,” Cadman said. 
“I tcld you. We’ve all been out 
— all except Cindy, and even 
she said she wanted to but we 
wouldn’t let her.” 

“The medics, too? Have they 
gone?” 

Cadman smiled. “Yes, in tan- 
dem.” 

Ralph considered this new in- 
formation. Then he said: 
“Could you eat afterwards, when 
you’d been out?” 

“Only when I wasn’t notic- 
ing,” Cadman said. “If 1 was en- 
grossed in my journal, and eat- 
ing was secondary, yes. Only 
once, when it was so dark I 
couldn’t write at all and when 
eating became a conscious thing 
— then 1 couldn’t.” 

“I can’t eat now,” Ralph said. 
“Oh,- you must. You’ll need 
your strength.” 

“I keep seeing them up there, 
like people, terrified of Hunter.” 
“Lots of vegetables move,” 
Cadman said. “Try to bear that 



in mind. You’ve seen waving 
wheat and Mexican jumping 
beans. You’ve seen a willow tree 
in a windstorm, shaking its skirt 
like a hula dancer. Didn’t you 
ever see an aspen shimmer in 
the slightest breeze, like a wom- 
an in sequins in a spotlight? 
Here, take this and go on back 
to your hummock and try. No 
one will watch you. It’s a sort of 
unwritten rule.” 

Ralph was touched by Cad- 
man’s concern. After a moment 
he said: “Thanks; I’ll try. I 
shouldn’t have stared at you and 
the rest, should I? I’m sorry.” 
“That’s all right. Go ahead 
and eat. I have a lot of writing 
to do. I especially want to get 
down my little speech to you — 
the one about the moving vege- 
tables — before I forget it. For- 
give my vanity.” 

Ralph went back to his hum- 
mcc’: and, resolutely thinking of 
gingerbread men and Mexican 
jum.ping beans, managed to eat a 
little. Then he must have dozed, 
back of neck comfortably 
against hummock’s edge, be- 
cause when he next noticed the 
sun -sun had joined the sun- 
moon in the sky.

I 'n the bright, hard light the 
knoll where the drama had 
taken place was like any small

hilltop, and the creatures which 
had been hunted were about as 
lively as a cornfield. 

Ralph’s companions sat on or 
lay against their hummocks in a 
seeming stupor, except Cadman, 
who was writing. Cadman was al- 
most always writing. 

Ralph stood up, then 
staggered as he tried to walk. He 
was weak, like any hospital pa- 
tient who had been on his back 
for a long time. He knew then, 
as well as if one of the medics 
had explained it to him, that he 
needed food. He felt him- 
self toppling and guided his fall 
toward the little pile of food 
Cadman had persuaded him to 
keep and to try to eat. 

Lying on his left side where 
he had gone down (none of the 
others had made the slightest ef- 
fort to help him, Ralph reached 
for one of the food pieces. But 
even before he brought it to his 
mouth he realized he couldn’t 
eat it. It was not that there was 
anything psychologically wrong, 
as there had been last night, 
now the stuff was literally inedi- 
ble. He could no more have got 
nourishment from the thing he 
was holding than he could have 
got marrow from a stone. 

Feebly, he threw it away. It 
bounced toward Jeffries, who fi- 
nally looked up, rousing himself 
from his torpor. 

“You have to eat it while it’s 



fresh,’’ Jeffries said, as if every- 
body should have known that. 
“All the good goes out of it over- 
night.” 

“I feel weak.” 

“You should have eaten last 
night. Last night it had the crun- 
chiness of celery, the juiciness of 
good rare steak, the crumbly 
consistency of cheese. I enjoyed 
it. Mad or not. Hunter gave me 
a particularly fine piece. But to- 
day it would be like eating an 
old cowflop.” 

“I’m hungry,” Ralph said. 
“Isn’t there anything else I 
could eat?” 

Jeffries shrugged. “Poison ivy 
salad.” 

“If I had the strength I’d drag 
myself over to the ridge and cut 
myself a fresh piece. I don’t 
think it’s as traumatic an experi- 
ence as Hunter made out. 

Jeffries shrugged again. He 
looked bored with Ralph s 
troubles. “Suit yourself.” 

“I suppose I’ve got to go. 
Ralph tried a jest; “I can’t sit 
around starving until the next 
safari leaves, can I? 

“It’s your stomach,” Jeffries 
said, vastly uninterested. He 
leaned back against his hum- 
mock and closed his eyes. 

Hating him suddenly, Ralph 
— *• to his knees, then stood erect 
and, carefully putting one foot 
ahead of the other, started out 
of the glade toward the far ridge 



136 



GALAXY 

_Jl 



where the vegetation stood mo- 
tionless under the brilliant sky. 

"O alph felt a bright light in- 
side his skull. Although 
there was a visual impression of 
great heat the temperature was 
no higher than it had been the 
previous night. He was not per- 
spiring. But there was no breath 
of motion to the air, and the un- 
filtered light hurt his eyes so 
that he had to close them to slits. 
The glare also seemed to focus 
on his brain, cooking it without 
heat. 

He envied the others their tor- 
por and their full bellies. Well, 
the sooner he got to the ridge 
and cut himself a meal, the 
sooner he’d be able to lounge 
against his own hummock and 
wait for it to be a more bearable 
time of day. 

Ralph stopped at the medics’ 
to borrow a machete. No one an- 
swered his call, so he helped 
himself to the heavy jungle 
knife which hung outside and 
went on through the wood. 

The toadstool - shaped, umber- 
colored trees gave some relief 
from the stabbing light, but the 
glare was so much more intense 
when there were gaps between 
the tall trees that it seemed al- 
most worse to have had their 
random protection. 

His brain cooking, Ralph 
could understand why the food 

THE WATCHERS IN THE GLADE 



gathering took place after the 
sun-sun had set. 

Step by dogged step he 
brought himself to the base of 
the ridge where the crop, or 
whatever it was, grew. It stood 
there in stalks, like a dusty corn 
field, yellowy-tan, silent, unmov- 
ing. 

In a final burst of forced en- 
ergy, Ralph went up the rise and 
cut a single stalk. 

His machete sliced through it 
effortlessly. There was no excite- 
ment or danger, as there had 
seemed to be when Hunter was 
here last night. 

Nobody, nothing, grimaced at 
Ralph, or threw up his-her-its 
hands in despair. 

Nobody, nothing, screamed; 
or opened a mouth (or anything 
like a mouth) to scream, silent- 
ly or otherwise. 

It was dull, in fact. He felt a 
little disappointed because there 
had been no dashing back and 
forth of humanoid plants, no 
mystery or drama. Each of the 
other faded-tan stalks had 
drooped dutifully, dully in its 
place while he cut down its 
brother. 

The stuff didn’t even wave, as 
wheat was said to do. It certain- 
ly hadn’t waved at Ralph, either 
with affection or fear. 

Giddy because of his hunger 
and the piercing light in his 
skull but pleased with himself, 

137 



Ralph looked across the v. ley 
to the glade where his fellow 
castaways sat or lay, locked in 
ennui. They had certainly made 
a big problem out of this harvest- 
ing, this bringing in of the 
sheaves. 

He couldn’t make out the ex- 
pressions on their faces, but all 
of them seemed to be watching 
him. Hunter particularly 
(mighty hunter, indeed!) seemed 
to have an intent eye on him. 

Having gained strength 
from his triumph, Ralph decid- 
ed it would be possible to return 
to the glade with his stalk intact 
and eat it there — perhaps even 
to make the magnanimous ges- 
ture of offering some to Hunter. 
This thought buoyed him up so 
that the trip back took much 
less time than his outward jour- 
ney. 

T he sun-sun had passed its 
zenith before his return. His 
fellow castaways seemed to gain 
strength as the brightness faded 
and they left their hummocks to 
greet him. Even Larcom and 
Raney had come to the glade 
from their self-imposed segrega- 
tion. 

Ralph, so elated by this re- 
ception that he felt he could 
postpone eating almost indefin- 
itely, tossed his trophy to the 
ground. It fell with a tiny rus- 
tling noise. 



Hunter looked down at it, 
then at Ralph. “Back with your 
kill, are you, Nevins?” he asked 
sardonically. 

Ralph replied modestly; “Oh, 
I wouldn’t call it a ‘kill.’ It 
wasn’t all that hard.” 

“Was it easy?” Jeffries asked. 
“Well, I did what I had to do. 
It was easy, frankly, and not at 
all traumatic.” 

“So much so,” Hunter said 
with a sneer, “that you don’t see 
what aU the fuss was about, do 
you? Isn’t that right?” 

“Oh, I think I can understand 
how the ritual came to be built 
up,” Ralph said, smiling despite 
a sudden new pang of hunger 
(he could hold out a few min- 
utes longer, anyway.) “I guess 
after I’ve been out here in the 
glade as long as you have. I’ll 
welcome some sort of diversion 
too. Some kind of — ” 

“Amateur dramatics?” Hunter 
asked. “Group theatricals?” 
“That’s it, of course,” Ralph 
said recklessly. “A kind of com- 
munity pageant to relieve the te- 
dium, with everyone playing his 
assigned role — ” 

Ralph’s voice trailed off as 
Cindy Garth came forward. The 
others stepped aside for her. 
She looked much better. Last 
night she had been mad; but 
now she was angry. “Just let me 
say something to him while I’m 
rational,” Cindy said. 



138 



GALAXY 



“Go ahead, Cindy,” Cadman 
said. 

Captain Larcom said: “Don’t 
excite yourself, Cindy. It’s not 
worth it.” 

Cindy said to Ralph: “You’re 
new here and we can forgive 
that.” It wasn’t the royal “we” 
she was using now. “Of course 
we were all together aboard the 
Patton and that should count for 
something, but these past two 
weeks when you were safely 
tucked away in the infirmary 
sometimes seem more like two 
years. We’ve all gone crazy in 
different ways, Nevins, and some 
more than others. You’ll find 
your own peculiar mania in a 
day or two. I’m sure. In the 
meantime give us credit for hav- 
ing a small residue of common 
sense. We do what we have to do 
— a few of us a little more 
strenuously than necessary — but 
we’re all human beings and we’ve 
all adjusted to this impossible 
planet the way we’ve had to. So 
stop feeling superior to Hunter 
because you went out in the mid- 
day sun. Things are not what 
they seem, especially in the eu- 
phoric noon. Nobody’s going to 
eat your pathetic little offering. 
Not even you.” 

Ralph met their various glanc- 
es, then dropped his gaze to his 
dry stalk. “Why not?” he asked 
hopelessly, already knowing the 
answer. “What’s wrong with it?” 



“Try it and see,” Cindy said 
softly. 

With his triumph turned to 
straw, Ralph’s hunger could no 
longer be denied. Finally, em- 
barrassed and in gnawing pain, 
he tried it. There was no nourish- 
ment in it. No juice or even mois- 
ture in the silly little stalk he had 
bravely harvested and brought 
back to gloat over. It was simply 
a dried hulk, like a cornstalk 
from last year’s mulch pile. He 
spat out the tasteless, powdery 
thing. 

“Sorry,” Cindy said. She add- 
ed, ever so rationally: “I suppose 
somebody should have told you 
the juices leave the stalk in day- 
light. The moisture that makes 
the plant edible hides in the 
roots until the sun-sun goes 
down.” 

V 

XTight finally came and he 
^ was able to go out again. 
His hunger had become a gnaw- 
ing ache, punctuated by an oc- 
casional stabbing pang. Ralph 
had taken Hunter’s advice on 
how to alleviate it by jogging 
around the perimeter, as all 
true hunters were alleged to do. 

The monotonous, jarring of 
feet on earth (Earth! — would he 
ever see it again?) had made the 
time pass faster and had even 
taken his mind off his hunger a 



THE WATCHERS IN THE GLADE 



139 



little. It had also numbed his 
mind, but again only a little. 

Because the waiting for night 
had been hard, they took com- 
passion on him to the extent of 
talking^ to him now and then. As 
he jogged he remembered dis- 
jointed random fragments: 

Hunter saying: “Let me assure 
you that there’s not one unnec- 
essary move in this nightly per- 
formance. In the first place it 
has to be every night. You found 
out for yourself that the stuff 
won’t keep through the heat of 
the day. .” 

Jog, jog, jog. 

Somebody (himself?) saying: 
“Grant me that you consider 
murder an odious occupation.” 
Thud of heels on packed 
earth. (Earth? No.) 

Somebody else: “Murder, yes; 
but not picking vegetables.” 
Ignore the pangs. Jog. Thud. 
Himself?: “Tell me what you 
consider murder to be.” 

Thud. Jog. Pang, pang. 
Another: “The destruction of 
a thinking being, I suppose.” 
Head back, breathe deeply of 
the still air. Jog, jog. 

Cindy Garth (listen, now; lis- 
ten to Cindy; Cindy knows): 
“We have communicated with 
them, though we know not how. 
A queenly gift of second sight? 
Telepathy? No matter; they are 
tiiinking beings.” (Cindy was 
mad again. Still, everyone was 



listening respectfully as if she 
told a truth they knew.) “We 
know them well. They are 
friendly, compatible, intelli- 
gent; lovable, even. They have 
been, at times, evocative to us of 
old friends, family, lovers . .” 
Cadman: “I had a Bunk John- 
son record that I used to play 
all the time. It was my grand- 
father’s. It was You Always Hurt 
the One you Love.” 

Himself?: “That’s all right; 

I’m a vegetarian.” 

Hunter: “Is that your bad 

joke for today, cannibal?” 

Who?: “We were all canni- 
bals once. That’s the kind of 
business we were in. We stole 
each other’s stories and cop- 
ied each other’s leads. We bribed 
and spied to cultivate a new 
source, preferably one ‘close to 
the presidential palace’ or ‘ac - 
quainted with the Leader s 
thinking,’ in our journalistic 
jargon, and then we fed on each 
other’s sources until they’d been 
milked dry and discarded for 
more sensational ones. Too of- 
ten we were less interested in 
writing the truth (which might 
just explode under everybody, 
us included) than we were in 
promulgating a government line 
or in helping an obscure depart- 
ment send up a trial balloon 
which quite often was shot down 
the following day. Knowingly 
abetting this, we were immoral, 

GALAXY 



we were savages, we were can- 
nibals.” 

J oggity jog-jog. Words, only 
words. They had no mean- 
ing to match that of hunger. 

Another (Cadman?) : “At 

least we’re honest cannibals now. 
We kill our fellow thinkers only 
that we may keep alive. If they 
think. There once was a paper 
in New York — remember New 
York? — that called itself ‘The 
Paper for People who Think.’ It 
was a Hearst paper and when it 
wanted to emphasize a word or 
a phrase in an editorial it print- 
ed it all in capital letters. It’s 
critics called it ‘The Paper for 
People who Think They Think.’ 
So maybe we only think they 
think — I mean maybe we only 
think they think. At least — let 
me see if I can think this 
through — I’d like to think we 
only think they think. What do 
you think?” 

And Cindy said: “If you 

think about it long enough you 
go crazy. If you think about any- 
; thing long enough you go crazy. 
We — I went crazy, thinking. I 
haven’t come back yet.” 

And Hunter said: “Shut up, 
Cindy. It’s hard enough without 
you reminding us all.” 

And Cindy: “But when I do 
come back I’ll comb my hair and 
put on makeup and maybe some- 
body, not noticing that I’m a 

THE WATCHERS IN THE GLADE 




cannibal, will dance with me. I 
won’t think then; I’ll just 
dream.” 

Hunter; “Shut up, Cindy.” 

Thud, thud. Jog, jog. The vi- 
brations jarring through his 
body were almost as good as 
food. (What a lie!) This way he 
could stand it (he told himself). 
As he jogged around the track, 
head back, fists clenched, he re- 
membered Cadman trying to 
persuade Cindy to let him 
(Ralph) have some of the emer- 
gency ration — the food he had 
been fed in the hospital. There 
couldn’t have been much of it 
but he found it hard to under- 
stand Cindy’s flat refusal. “Nev- 
ins isn’t going to starve to death 
in the next couple of hours,” 
she had said. “And he’ll learn a 
lesson.” 

He (Ralph) was learning it. 
He was Ralph. He was Nevins. 
He was (full name now Ralph 
Leslie Nevins. Oh, yes, he (you 
know who) was learning a good 
lesson. He was learning to hate 
them all, the bastards. Bastards 
and a bitch. Cindy Bitch -Queen 
Garth, who wouldn’t let him 
have the ration. Justin Bastard 
Jeffries, who had let him go out 
under the sun-sun, sadistically 
knowing he was making a futile 
trip. He hated Jeffries worse. 

He had wanted to go early but 
they explained (some of them 
reasonably, some shouting an- 

147 



grily) that it would do no good 
to cut a stalk until the juices had 
returned to it from the roots. 
Hadn’t he learned that? Ralph 
had said he would dig the roots 
(he was in pain, starving, fam- 
ished; it was impossible to bear) 
but they explained (as to a 
child, some of them, but others 
in disgust because he didn’t 
know what they knew) that 
when the roots were disturbed 
the moisture fled through them 
into the soil, leaving no nourish- 
ment. 

“You may think this is a lot 
of melodrama.” Who had said 
that. The Who who had spoken 
several times earlier. “It is not 
a lot of melodrama. It is essen- 
tial. Es-sen-tial. Know this.” 

He knew it now. He was con- 
vinced of it. His stomach was 
convinced, at least. His stomach 
was devout, a true believer. Jog; 
jog and thud. Was it still too 
early to go? He could under- 
stand how the -jogging would 
numb the mind as well as the 
stomach. 

F inally, finally, it was time. 

He left the perimeter, 
scarcely believing his release 
had come, he left the well-beat- 
en track and set off across the 
valley as the short night began. 

There they were, on the far 
ridge, waving, beckoning to him. 
To him? Beckoning? Or horri- 

^42 



fied to see him approach? Him 
— Nevins the hunter, the killer, 
the vegetable - eating cannibal. 
Nevins the new one, perhaps 
crueler than the others who had 
come before. 

Off he went, recalling his rel- 
atively calm conversation with 
Hunter (Hunter who had joined 
hunter — Ralph — in jogging 
around the track:) “But why do 
you call them wolves?” 

And Hunter saying : “A eu- 
phemism. Both hunter and hunt- 
ed became the wolves, the beasts. 
Each, driven by something out- 
side itself, loses its human qual- 
ities. I, forced by hunger; they, 
shaken by terror.” 

“You agree with Cindy that 
they think?” 

“I reject that possibility. I 
must. All I know is that they 
thrash about. Lots of plants can 
do that under certain circum- 
stances. But these seem to be un- 
der a double terror, or whatever 
word you want to use. ‘Fear’ is 
too weak. First, their terror of 
being killed; second, the un- 
acceptable realization that any- 
one or anything on their hereto- 
fore peaceful planet could con- 
ceive of killing another. In fact, 
killing was impossible because 
nobody — nothing, I mean — 
v/as able to move from the spot 
where he first germinated. I 
mean it. ” 

Ralph knew what he meant. 

GALAXY 



He had gone across the valley, 
through the toadstool wood, and 
was at the edge of the field of 
thrashing, terrified creatures. 
(Hunter was right: “fear” was 
too pallid a word.) 

Th_y could not be human; 
could not even be creatures. His 
mind told him this, but his emo- 
tions told him something else: 
Not only could they be creatures 
(living, if not breathing; think- 
ing, if not speaking), they were 
human. He knew that now, as of 
this minute. And what was he do- 
ing here, about to cornmit an 
atrocity upon one of them? Who 
was he, God?, to be destroying 
another living creature? He was 
not a flesh-eater, true, but he 
was undeniably a cannibal. 

Shut up, he told himself. You 
haven’t destroyed anybody yet 
and it’s a moot question whether 
you will. (This was not his stom- 
ach talking.) So don’t let any- 
body panic you. You’re just out 
here on a tactical exercise, so to 
speak — a dry run, so far, to see 
how you’ll react when the real 
thing comes along, if it ever 
does. Of course you aren’t going 
to kill these dear, helpless crea- 
tures. 

His stomach laughed at this 
nonsense. Certainly he was go- 
ing to kill. Kill and eat; kill and 
provide. It was kill or starve. 

It wasn’t an ethical problem at 
all — hadn’t his pioneer ances- 



tor’s killed to feed their famit 
lies? Hadn’t they killed daily? 
Hadn’t they slaughtered the dear 
little chickens and geese and 
bulls and brown-eyed calves and 
wooly lambs and whatever other 
sweet, succulent creatures stood 
between them and hunger, or 
even appetite? Of course they 
had. They might even be burn- 
ing in hell for it — if there waa 
a hell, anywhere else but here. 

'^hen he recalled Cindy’a 
vision of having communi<< 
cated with them, or of hav- 
ing thought she had. He was hav- 
ing a vision of his own, in hia 
extremity of starvation. He waa 
communicating with them him- 
self. 

Well, not really: they were re- 
vealing themselves to him; he 
had said nothing to them except 
tacitly, by being there with a 
weapon which spoke for him; si- 
lently, terribly. 

His hunger - induced rev- 
elations were graphic depictions 
of the most awful things that 
had ever happened to people he 
knew or to whom he was relat- 
ed. As remembered from his 
childhood in ghastly detail, they 
included: 

His Uncle Alfred, arrested 
through some terrible miscar- 
riage of justice and sentenced to 
a road gang in the South, drag- 
ging his ball and chain behind 



THE WATCHERS IN THE GLADE 



143 



him as his poor, broken- 
blistered hands, which he had 
previously used to chalk ab- 
struse, beautiful mathematical 
formulae on a blackboard at the 
Institute for Advanced Theory, 
tried to drive his mattock into 
the soil often enough to avoid 
the lash of the gang-master; 

His Grandma Maud, polio vic- 
tim, her leg in a brace, dragging 
it behind her as she tried to get 
closer to the faith healer who, 
for a twenty-five-dollar love of- 
fering, was laying on hands un- 
der a big tent in the vacant lot 
down near the railroad siding; 

His father, a foot caught in 
his own fox trap, and so weak 
from loss of blood that he was 
unable to pry it open, crawling 
through the woods toward the 
house more than a mile away; 

His mother, alone in the 
house in her wheelchair after 
her operation, when the oil- 
burner exploded . 

More visions crowded in on 
him; visions of people burdened 
or crippled or otherwise ren- 
dered unable to move very far 
or very fast: 

Visions of Roosevelt, of Joan 
of Arc, of Tantalus, of Christ . 

Then the visions coalesced and 
the vegetable people, hurling 
themselves away in their terri- 
fied attempt to escape his sword, 
took on the personalities of his 
hallucinations. It was more than 

144 




horrible, it was shocking and ob- 
scene, that he should be the in- 
strument of their distruction, 
that he should be forced to 
choose which of these well 
beloved creatures he would 
maim and kill. 

Worse: not which, but whom. 

You always hurt the one you 
love . 

But must you kill? 

Must you choose among moth- 
er, father, saint, president, God? 
Was it necessary to decide, cold- 
ly, in the midst of horror, whom 
to destroy? Did continued exis- 
tence demand that he pick 
which body would be sliced 
through with his blade? Did life 
depend on slaughter? 

R alph avoided the answers as 
the terrified plant creatures 
hurler themselves away from 
this executioner; from this des- 
picable thing that would kill and 
eat its own family, its own Lord. 

(But why not? Did not some 
religions hold that the commu- 
nion wafer was the actual, the 
literal body of Christ? Is it can- 
nibalism to eat the flesh of Je- 
sus? 

Faster and faster they seemed 
to circle, to come toward him re- 
luctantly, fearfully, bending 
back away from him until they 
were almost flat on the ground; 
then, as their Coney Island ride 
brought them inevitably past 

GALAXY 



hurricane-tossed palm branches, 
straining to escape, to be beyond 
the reach of his terrible blade. 

Three times he raised his ma- 
chete — three times, impelled by 
the gnawing in his stomach. 
Each time he let it fall to his 
side. 

He sobbed in frustration: how 
could be cut down these beauti- 
ful people, these gods and god- 
desses? How could he butcher 
his mother or his father (or his 
Father) and then feed them to 
his friends? 

Of course he couldn’t. He 
dropped his machete. He’d rath- 
er die. 

Then Hunter was there, shout- 
ing: “You’ve got to jog, man, 
jog! You were just standing. You 
can’t let them get through to 
you; it’s impossible if they do 
Jog, jog. Come on, Nevins! Can 
you do it? Can you?” 

Obviously Ralph could not. 
He sank to the ground. Hunter 
said: “Too bad. Never mind; 
stand back.” 

With a swish of his own ma- 
chete, Hunter lopped down a 
big stalk as it hurtled past him, 
expertly severing it close to the 
ground. 

A hallucinatory voice, not 
Hunter’s, taunted Ralph: 

“How speaks he now, 

This loud-voiced, 

proud-voiced 

newcomer? 

THE WATCHERS IN THE GLADE. 




“A change of tune, 
a dull harpoon; 
less haughty 

than he thought he was.” 

It had a pedantic sound, as if 
one of his old professors of jour- 
nalism, or maybe an over edu- 
cated city editor, was sneering at 
him. 

Then came Hunter’s voice. 
There was nothing hallucina- 
tory about it. 

“Okay, Nevins, let’s go. That’s 
all for today.” 

But Ralph could do nothing 
and Hunter had to half-carry 
him back to the glade. 

VI 

'^he others watched openly 
■ as Cindy, cradling him in 
her left arm, his head against 
her breast, fed him. Too weak 
now to move or protest, he ac- 
cepted mouthfuls of nourish- 
ment without questioning its 
origin. Cindy, feeding him and 
herself alternately, chewing 
away, smiled at him. He smiled 
back, chewing also, his palate 
reveling in what it imagined to 
be a smorgasbord of delicacies, 
successively: 

• the whitest, crunchiest cel- 
ery, stuffed with the best home- 
made cheese, sprinkled with pap- 
rika; 

• a gargantuan ripe olive, pit- 
ted; 

145 



• crisp, warm, buttered whole 
wheat toast; 

• freshly-given milk; 

• a bite into a Winesap apple; 

• a morsel of perfectly-fried 
scallop; 

• a mouthful of Maine lobster, 
dipped in melted Wisconsin but- 
ter; 

• a forkful of Idaho potato, 
baked, whipped with butter and 
salted; 

• a slice of rare roast beef; 

• a slightly-salted, gorgeous- 
ly-green avocado half; 

• a demi-tasse of Columbian 
coffee. 

He was very t delirious, of 
course. 

^"T^hat was about the end of 
it. Ralph never went out 
again. After he had been nour- 
ished back to the point where he 
could feed himself, Cindy would 
have nothing more to do with 
him. She retreated into her re- 
gal self, her moment of compas- 
sion spent. 

Hunter once again as- 
sumed de facto command. He 
was their only possible provider. 
Despite the others’ brave talk or 
their sneers at Ralph, Hunter 
was the only one who had been 
out more than once. Hunter 
alone had been capable of work- 
ing out the logistics of the situa- 
tion; he alone had been strong 
enough to keep his fears, his il- 

146 



lusions, his hallucinations to 
himself. It was obvious that Cin- 
dy was only the titular ruler. 

Sometime later Cadman died 
and Ralph took over the keep- 
ing of the journal. 

The medics, who did not say 
why Cadman had died, buried 
him during the short, bright 
day, at the edge of the plant-peo- 
ple patch on the far ridge. It was 
only right, Ralph supposed, that 
Cadman’s remains should nour- 
ish the roots of the plants. 

Ralph wrote: “Now that I am 
no longer an active participant 
in the hunt, I am beginning to 
find it exciting.” 

At first the others expressed 
interest in his daily journal en- 
tries and even praised him, 
sometimes, for the cleverness of 
his writing. 

“Cadman merely record- 
ed,” Jeffries said to him once, 
“but you comment. Cadman was 
a journalist, you are an histo- 
rian.” 

Ralph glowed to that for days, 
although in his American way he 
would have said “a historian.” 
To him the other was like say- 
ing “an horse.” 

But after a while Jeffries and 
the others, with one exception, 
lost interest in the journal, even 
when it mentioned them, and 
drew back to their own hum- 
mocks. 

Only at night, when Hunter 
GALAXY 



was out bagging their game, was 
there a drawing together in an 
approximation of a community 
spirit. And it was clear to Ralph 
now that nothing else mattered. 
Nothing else was vital. 

And of course after a while 
Ralph wrote about nothing else. 
His daily entry was an ingeni- 
ous attempt, by a resourceful 
journalist - turned - historian, to 
find fresh meaning in the night- 
ly hunt. 

The only other one who cared 
was Hunter. Therefore it be- 
came a ritual with them to meet 
after the nightly division of the 
nutrient (the vegetable, the 
meat, the Wafer — whatever it 
was) and for Hunter to describe 
his adventures to Ralph. Hunter 
would talk — in the first person 
singular or plural, depend- 
ing on his mood — and Ralph 
would make notes before either 
of them touched his nightly ra- 
tion. 

Having finished his notes, 
Ralph and Hunter would with- 
draw to their separate hummocks 
and eat. Hunter vomiting less 
often than he used to. Ralph ate 
thoughtfully and without after- 
effects, scarcely aware of his 
bites as he considered how best 
to transcribe his notes. 

But there the strain became 
too much for even Hunter’s ego 
and he became repetitive at yjl 
duU. 



Ralph became alarme.J. If 
there were no more to write his 
function would vanish as Cad- 
man’s had. He would become su- 
perfluous. 

He went to Cindy Garth, to re- 
cord her reactions to the nightly 
kill, but she waved him away 
languidly. He wrote this up as 
verbosely as possible. 

He went to Jeffries, who met 
him with an amused smile but 
told him: “Nothing to say, old 
boy.” When Ralph persisted, 
Jeffries dismissed him by say- 
ing: “It’s all been said, you 

know. I told it to Cadman a doz- 
en times and he took it down 
each time. I have no desire to re- 
peat myself to you. Look it up 
in Cadman’s journal if you like 
but don’t bother me.” 

Ralph wrote up his talk with 
Jeffries at as great a length as 
possible, quoting himself as well 
as Jeffries (he had deliberately 
asked some long-winded ques- 
tions). But it was impossible to 
string it out forever. 

He went to the medics and was 
rewarded with an outpouring of 
words. Away from the others, 
Larcom and Raney had witty 
and crackling things to say about 
the few events their world pro- 
vided. Ralph, delighted, took 
full notes and transcribed at 
great length. This kept him busy 
for many days. 

But then they began to repeat 

147 



THE WATCHERS IN THE GLADE 



themselves. Their apparent wit 
charmed the new acquain- 
tance, but one who came to know 
them for any length of time re- 
alized that there was a limit to 
the variations they could apply 
to their basic conversational for- 
mula. They became tiresome as 
well as repetitious. Then, as if 
realizing their failure to enter- 
tain, they became argumentive 
— first with each other, then 
with Ralph. 

A t that point Ralph, hav- 
ing transcribed all that 
was available from them jointly, 
interviewed them singly. Separ- 
ate floodgates opened; Ralph 
took down page after page of 
pent-up frustration, petty tirade 
and invective as each of the med- 
ics turned his wrath on the oth- 
er. 

Fascinated, occasionally re- 
pelled, Ralph wrote them up at 
gratifying length, first together 
and then separately. But this 
field also went fallow as even- 
tually each developed a case of 
the sulks and refused to talk to 
him. 

This left no one. 

Doggedly, Ralph went back to 
each: to Hunter who, having 
rested as raconteur, was good for 
a few more nights; to Jeffries, 
whose now-insulting behavior to- 
ward Ralph provided a day's 
copy; and to Cindy, who was 



completely silent but whose at- 
titude Ralph described in great 
detail, drawing heavily on sur- 
mise. 

Again there was no one left. 
Except — inspiration! — him- 
self. But he found himself a thin 
source. For several days he 
talked to himself and recorded 
the result. But Ralph had always 
been an honest reporter and this 
deceit soon palled. 

He v/as unable to delude him- 
self, as Cadman had, that he was 
preparing a dispatch. Nor would 
he put down fiction or half- 
truths; his entire journalistic 
background rebelled against 
such heresy. 

He examined his pen and the 
other one that Cadman had in- 
voluntarily bequeathed him. 
Ink aplenty, enough for a dec- 
ade, remained in each. It seemed 
clear that there was more ink 
than there were words to write 
with it. 

He knew now why poor Cad- 
man had died. Cadman had been 
no egocentric hero. He had been, 
as Ralph Nevins was, an honest 
journalist: not an analyst but an 
annalist. 

And the annals were com- 
plete. Nothing more remained to 
be said about this handful of hu- 
xr-'n beings stranded on the only 
habitable planet between Sol’s 
Earth and Barnard’s Oph. 

Nevertlieless much had to be 



148 



GALAXY 



said, regardless of whether it was 
worth saying, if Ralph were to 
remain sane against the day 
when the rescue ship heaved to 
and took him home. The easy 
way would be to let himself slip 
into the madness of Ramsey 
Hunter and Cindy Garth, the 
apathy of Justin Jeffries or the 
self-centered isolation of the 
medics. But Ralph was not ready 
to give up. As long as he did not 
have to go out at night to bring 
in the sheaves, it was possible to 
work and to hope. 

Then the engine in his mind 
started and its fuel was his mem- 
ories. He realized that what was 
within himself was limited : 
there was only Ralph Nevins, at 
the current or earlier age, on 
which to draw. Still a single per- 
son was a microcosm of the hu- 
man race and perhaps he was as 
good as any other for the pur- 
pose, at this particular time. 

That being so, he reached 
back as far into his memory as 
it was possible to go. 

(he knew that when he had 
nothing more to say he would be 
dead) 

. and he found a place 



Thus, one night, after having 
dined with pleasure, without 
questioning the source, on an 
unusually thick stalk which he 
chose to think tasted of Thanks- 
giving turkey, he wrote the fol- 
lowing in his journal: 

Book I, Chapter One 
Nevins the Child, or, The Humble Start 
Ralph Leslie Nevins, so named by 
his parents, Leslie Coombs and Les- 
lie Hume Nevins (we shall return to 
this coincidence of names presently, 
aged respectively 25 and 22, was 
bom. In wedlock, on an August day. 
the 17th, a Thursday, to be precise. 

In the Year of Our Lord, or Who- 
ever is In Charge, 1999 . 

4 nd thus Ralph Nevins be- 
gan the chronicle which we 
found when we grew over to the 
glade and which, together with 
other scattered documents from 
the worlds that they had 
attempted to colonize, provided 
us with an invaluable insight to 
the mores of those who knew 
themselves as human beings. 

Oh, yes. To answer Ralph’s 
question, it might just be noted 
that we’re in charge here. And 
everywhere.

Mortal enemies? No . for

I 

F resh snow had fallen dur- 
ing the night. Now it lay 
like a white sheet atop the older 
snow, nine or ten feet of it, that 
already covered the plain. Now 
all was smooth and clear almost 
to the horizon. As Michael Holt 
peered through the foot - thick 
safety glass of his command 
room window, he saw, first of 
all, the zone of brown earth, a 
hundred yards in diameter, cir- 
cling his house, and then the be- 
ginning of the snowfield with a 
few jagged bare trees jutt- 
ing through it, and then, finally. 



a blot on the horizon, the metal- 
lic tower that was Andrew Mc- 
Dermott’s dwelling. 

Not in seventy or eighty years 
had Holt looked at the McDer- 
mott place without feeling ha- 
tred and irritation. The planet 
was big enough, wasn’t it? Why 
had McDermott chosen to stick 
his pile of misshapen steel down 
right where Holt had to look at 
it all his days? McDermott’s es- 
tate was big enough. McDermott 
could have built his house an- 
other fifty or sixty miles to the 
east, near the banks of the wide, 
shallow river that flowed 
through the heart of the con- 



150 




tlnent. He hadn’t cared to. Holt 
had politely suggested it, when 
the surveyors and architects first 
came out from Earth. McDer- 
mott had just as politely insist- 
ed on putting his house where 
he wanted to put it. 

It was still there.. Michael 
Holt peered at it, and his insides 
roiled. He walked to the control 
console of the armament panel, 
and let his thin, gnarled hands 
rest for a moment on a gleaming 
rheostat. 

There was an almost sexual 
manner to the way Holt fondled 
the jutting knobs and studs of 
the console. Now that his two 
hundredth year was approach- 
ing, he rarely handled the bod- 
ies of his wives that way any 
more. But then he did not love 
his wives as keenly as he loved 
the artillery emplacement with 
which he could blow Andrew 
McDermott to atoms. 

Just let him provoke me. Holt 
thought. 

He stood by the panel, a tall, 
gaunt man with a withered face 
and a savage hook of a nose and 
a surprisingly thick shock of 
faded red hair. He closed his 
eyes and allowed himself the 
luxury of a daydream. 

T T e imagined that Andrew 
McDermott had given him 
offense. Not simply the eternal 
offense of being there in his 



view, but some direct, specific 
affront. Poaching on his land, 
perhaps. Or sending a robot out 
to hack down a tree on the bor- 
derland. Or putting up a flash- 
ing neon sign that mocked Holt 
in some vulgar way. Anything 
that would serve as an excuse for 
hostilities. 

And then: Holt saw himself 
coming up here to the command 
room and broadcasting an ulti- 
matum to the enemy. “Take that 
sign down, McDermott,” he 
might say. “Keep your robots off 
my land,” perhaps. Or else, 
“This -means war!” 

McDermott would answer 
with a blast of radiation, of 
course, because that was the kind 
of sneak he was. The deflector 
screens of Holt’s front line de- 
fenses would handle the bolt 
with ease, soaking it in and feed- 
ing the energy straight to Holt’s 
own generators. 

Then, at long lasf. Holt would 
answer back. His fingers would 
tighten on the controls. Crack- 
ling arcs of energy would leap 
toward the ionosphere and bound 
downward at McDermott’s place, 
spearing through his piti- 
ful screens as though they 
weren’t there. Holt saw himself 
gripping the controls with 
knuckle - whitening fervor, 
launching thunderbolt after 
thunderbolt while on the hori- 
xon Andrew McDermott’s 



152 



GALAXY 



hideous keep blazed and glowed 
in hellish fire and crumpled 
and toppled and ran in molten 
puddles over the snow. 

Yes, that would be the mo- 
ment to live for! 

That would be the moment of 
triumph! 

To step back from the con- 
trols at last, and look through 
the window and see the glowing 
red spot on the horizon where 
the McDermott place had been. 
To pat the controls as though 
they were the flanks of a be- 
loved old horse. To leave the 
house, and ride across the bor- 
derland into the McDermott es- 
tate, and see the charred ruin, 
and know that he was gone for- 
ever. 

Then, of course, there would 
be an inquiry. The fifty lords of 
the planet would meet to discuss 
the battle, and Holt would ex- 
plain, “He wantonly provoked 
me. I need not tell you how he 
gave me offense by building his 
house within my view. But this 
time — ” 

And Holt’s fellow lords would 
nod sagely. They would un- 
derstand, for they valued their 
own unblemished views as high- 
ly as Holt himself. They would 
exonerate him and grant him 
McDermott’s land, as far as the 
horizon, so no newcomer could 
repeat the offense. 

Michael Holt smiled. The day- 



dream left him satisfied. His 
heart raced perhaps a little too 
enthusiastically as he pictured 
that slagheap on the horizon. He 
made an effort to calm himself. 
He was, after all, a fragile old 
man, much as he hated to admit 
it, and even the excitement of a 
daydream taxed his strength. 

He walked away from the 
panel, back to the window. 

Nothing had changed. The zone 
of brown earth where his melt- 
ers kept back the snow, and 
then the white field, and final- 
ly the excrescence on the hori- 
zon, glinting coppery red 
in the thin midday sunlight. 
Holt scowled. The daydream 
had changed nothing. No shot 
had been fired. McDermott’s 
keep still stained the view. 
Turning, Holt began to shuffle 
slowly out of the room, toward 
the dropshaft that would take 
him five floors downward to his 
family. 

II 

T he communicator chimed. 

Holt stared at the screen in 
surprise. 

“Yes?” 

“An outside call for you. Lord 
Holt. Lord McDermott is call- 
ing,” the bland metallic voice 
said. 

“Lord McDermott’s secretary, 
you mean?” 



NEIGHBOR 



“It is Lord McDermott him- 
self, your lordship.” 

Holt blinked. “You’re jok- 
ing,” he said. “It’s fifty years 
since he called me. If this is a 
prank I’ll have your circuits 
shorted!” 

“I cannot joke, your lordship. 
Shall I tell Lord McDermott you 
do not wish to speak to him?” 

“Of course!” Holt snapped. 
“No — wait. Find out what he 
wants. Then tell him I can’t 
speak to him.” 

Holt sank back into a chair in 
front of the screen. He nudged a 
button with his elbow, and tiny 
fingers began to massage 
the muscles of his back, where 
tension poisons had sud- 
denly flooded in to stiffen him. 

McDermott calling? What 
for? 

To complain, of course. Some 
trespass, no doubt. Some serious 
trespass, if McDermott felt he 
had to make the call himself. 

Michael Holt’s blood warmed. 
Let him complain! Let him ac- 
cuse, let him bluster! Perhaps 
this would give the excuse for 
hostilities at last. Holt ached to 
declare war. He had been guild- 
ing his armaments patiently for 
decade after decade, and he 
knew beyond doubt that he had 
the capability to destroy McDer- 
mott within moments after the 
first shot was fired. No screens 
in the universe could withstand 



the array of weaponry Holt had 
assembled. The outcome of a 
conflict was in no doubt. Let 
him statt something, Michael 
Holt prayed. Oh, let him be the 
aggressor! I’m ready for him, and 
more than ready! 

The bell chimed again. The 
robot voice of Holt’s secretary 
said, “I have spoken to him, 
your lordship. He will tell me 
nothing. He wants you.” 

Holt sighed. “Very well. Put 
him on, then.” 

There was a moment of elec- 
tronic chaos on the screen as the 
robot shifted from the inside 
channel to an outside one. Holt 
sat stiffly, annoyed by the sud- 
den anxiety he felt. He realized, 
strangely, that he had forgotten 
what his enemy’s voice sound- 
ed like. All communication be- 
tween them had been through 
robot intermediaries for years. 

The screen brightened and 
showed a test pattern. A hoarse, 
querulous voice said, “Holt? 
Holt, where are you?” 

“Right here in my chair, Mc- 
Dermott. What’s troubling 
you?” 

“Turn your visual on. Let me 
have a look at you, Holt.” 

“You can speak your piece 
without seeing me, can’t you? Is 
my face that fascinating to 
you?” 

“Please. This is no time for 
bickering. Turn the visual on!” 



154 



GALAXY 



“Let me remind you,” Holt 
said coldly, “that you have 
called me. The normal rules of 
etiquette require that I have the 
privilege of deciding on the 
manner of transmission. And I 
prefer not to be seen. I also pre- 
fer not to be speaking to you. 
You have thirty seconds to state 
your complaint. Important busi- 
ness awaits me.” 

* I 'here was silence. Holt 
gripped the arms of his 
chair and signalled for a more 
intense massage. He became 
aware, in great irritation, that 
his hands were trembling. He 
glared at the screen as though 
he could burn his enemy’s brain 
out simply by sending angry 
thoughts over the communicator. 

McDermott said finally, “I 
have no complaint. Holt. Only 
an invitation.” 

“To tea?” Holt sneered. 

“Call it that. I want you to 
come here. Holt.” 

“You’ve lost your mind!” 

“Not yet. Come to me. Let’s 
have a truce,” McDermott 
rasped. “We’re both old, sick, 
stupid men. It’s time to stop the 
hatred.” 

Holt laughed. “We’re both 
old, yes. But I’m not sick and 
you’re the only stupid one. Isn’t 
it a little late for the olive 
branch?” 

“Never too late.” 



“You know there can’t ever 
be peace between us,” Holt said. 
“Not so long as that eyesore of 
yours sticks up over the trees. 
It’s a cinder in my eye, McDer- 
mott. I can’t ever forgive you for 
building it.” 

“Will you listen to me?” Mc- 
Dermott said. “When I’m gone, 
you can blast the place apart, if 
it pleases you. All I want is for 
you to come here. I — I need 
you. Holt. I want you to pay me 
a visit.” 

“Why don’t you come here, 
then?” Holt jeered. “I’ll throw 
my door wide for you. We’ll sit 
by the fire and reminisce about 
all the years we hated each 
other.” 

“If I could come to you,” Mc- 
Dermott said, “there would 
be no need for us to meet at all.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“Turn your visual on, and 
you’ll see.” 

Michael Holt frowned. He 
knew he had become hideous 
with age, and he was not eager 
to show himself to his enemy. 
But he could not see McDermott 
without revealing himself at the 
same time. With an abrupt, im- 
pulsive gesture. Holt jabbed the 
control button in his chair. The 
mists on the screen faded, and 
an image appeared. 

All Holt could see was a face, 
shrunken, wizened, wasted. Mc- 
Dermott was past two hundred. 



NEIGHBOR 



155 



Holt knew, and he looked it. 

I There was no flesh left on his 
face. The skin lay like parch- 
ment over bone. The left side of 
his face was distorted, the nos- 
tril flared, the mouth-corner 
dragged down to reveal the 
teeth, the eyelid drooping. Be- 
low the chin, McDermott was 
invisible, swathed in machinery, 
his body cocooned in what was 
probably a nutrient bath. He 
was obviously in bad shape. 

H e said, “I’ve had a stroke. 
Holt. I’m paralyzed from 
the neck down. I can’t hurt 
you.” 

“When did this happen?” 

“A year ago.” 

“You’ve kept very quiet about 
it,” Holt said. 

“I didn’t think you’d care to 
know. But now I do. I’m dying. 
Holt, and I want to see you once 
face to face before I die. I know 
you’re suspicious. You think I’m 
crazy to ask you to come here. 
ni turn my screens off. I’ll send 
aU my robots across the river. 
Ill be absolutely alone here, 
helpless, and you can come with 
an army if you like. There. 
Doesn’t that sound like a trap. 
Holt? I know I’d think so if I 
were in your place and you were 
in mine. But it isn’t a trap. Can 
you believe that? Ill open my 
door to you. You can come and 
laugh in my face as I lie here. 



But come. There’s something I 
have to tell you, something of vi- 
tal importance to you. And 
you’ve got to be here in person 
when I teU you. You won’t re- 
gret coming. Believe that. Holt.” 

Holt stared at the wizened 
creature in the screen, and trem- 
bled with doubt and confusion. 

The man must be a limatic! It 
was years since Holt had last 
stepped beyond the protection 
of his own screens. Now McDer- 
mott was asking him not only to 
go into the open field, where he 
might be gunned down with 
ease, but to enter into McDer- 
mott’s house itself, to put his 
head right between the jaws of 
the lion. 

Absurd ! 

McDermott said, “Let me 
show you my sincerity. My 
screens are off. Take a shot at 
the house. Hit it anywhere. Go 
ahead. Do your worst!” 

Deeply troubled, chilled with 
mystification. Holt elbowed out 
of his chair and went beyond 
the range of the visual pickup, 
over to the control console of 
the guns. How many times in 
dreams he had fondled these 
studs and knobs, never once dar- 
ing to fire them except in test 
shots directed at his own prop- 
e^'ty! It was unreal to be actual- 
ly training the sights on the 
gleaming tower of McDermott’s 
bouse at last Excitement surged 



156 



GALAXY 



in him. Could this all be some 
subtle way, he wondered, of 
causing him to have a fatal heart 
attack through overstimula- 
tion? 

He gripped the controls. He 
pondered, considered tossing a 
thousand megawatt beam at Mc- 
Dermott, then decided to use 
sometliing a little milder. If the 
screens really were down all the 
way, even his feeblest shot would 
score. 

He sighted — not on the house 
itself, but on a tree just within 
McDermott’s inner circle of de- 
fense. He fired, still half con- 
vinced he was dreaming. The 
tree became a yard-high stump. 

“That’s it,” McDermott called. 
“Go on. Aim at the house, too! 
Knock a turret off — the screens 
are down!” 

Senile dementia. Holt 
thought. Baffled, he lifted the 
sight a bit and let the beam play 
against one of McDermott’s out- 
buildings. The shielded wall 
glov.'ed a moment, then gave as 
the beam smashed its way 
through. Ten square feet of Mc- 
Dermott’s castle now was a soup 
of protons, fleeing into the cold. 

Holt realized in stunned 
disbelief that there was nothing 
at cll preventing him from des- 
troying McDermott and his odi- 
ous house entirely. 

There was no risk of a coun- 
terattack. He would not even 



need to use the heavy artillery 
that he had been so jealously 
hoarding against this day. A 
light beam would do it easily 
enough. 

It would be too easy this way, 
though. 

There could be no pleasure in 
a wanton attack. McDermott had 
not provoked him. Rather, he 
sat there in his cocoon, 
sniveling and begging to be 
visited. 

Holt returned to the visual 
field. “I must be as crazy as you 
are,” he said. “Turn your robots 
loose and leave your screens 
down. I’ll come to visit you. I 
wish I understood this, but I’ll 
come anyway.” 

Ill 

M ichael Holt called his 
family together. Three 
wives, the eldest near his own 
age, the youngest only seventy. 
Seven sons, ranging in age from 
sixty to a hundred thirteen. The 
wives of his sons. His grand- 
children. His top echelon of ro- 
bots. 

He assembled them in the 
grand hall of Holt Keep, took 
his place at the head of the ta- 
ble, and stared down the rows at 
their faces, so like his own. He 
said quietly, “I am going to pay 
a call on Lord McDermott.” 

He could see the shock on 

157 



NEIGHBOR 



their faces. They were too well 
disciplined to speak their minds, 
of course. He was Lord Holt. 
His word was law, and he could, 
if he so pleased, order them all 
put to death on the spot. Once, 
many years before, he had been 
forced to assert his parental au- 
thority in just such a way, and 
no one would ever forget it. 

He smiled. “You think I’ve 
gone soft in my old age, and per- 
haps I have. But McDermott has 
had a stroke. He’s completely 
paralyzed from the neck down. 
He wants to tell me something, 
and I’m going to go. His screens 
are down and he’s sending all his 
robots out of the house. I could 
have blasted the place apart if 
I wanted to.’’ 

He could see the muscles 
working in the jaws of his sons. 
They wanted to cry out, but they 
did not dare. 

Holt went on, “I’m going 
alone except for a few robots. If 
there’s been no word from me 
for half an hour after I’m seen 
entering the house, you’re au- 
thorized to come after me. If 
there’s any interference with the 
rescue party, it will mean war. 
But I don’t think there’U be 
trouble. Anyone who comes aft- 
er me in less than half an hour 
will be put to death.’’ 

Holt’s words died away in a 
shiver of echoes. He eyed them 
all, one at a time. 



This was a critical moment, 
he knew. If they dared, they 
might decide among themselves 
that he had gone mad, and de- 
pose him. That had happened 
before, too, in other families. 
They could topple him, repro- 
gram all the robots to take com- 
mands from them instead and 
confine him to his wing of the 
house. He had given them evi- 
dence enough, just now, of his 
irresponsibility. 

But they made no move. They 
lacked the guts. He was head of 
the household, and his word was 
law. They sat, pale and shaken 
and dazed, as he rolled his chair 
past them and out of the grand 
hall. 

Within an hour, he was ready 
to go. Winter was in the fourth 
of its seven months, and Michael 
Holt had not left the house since 
the first snowfall. But he had 
nothing to fear from the ele- 
ments. He would not come in 
contact with the frigid air of the 
sub-zero plain. He entered his 
car within his own house, and it 
glided out past the defense peri- 
meter, a gleaming dark teardrop 
sliding over the fresh snow. 
Eight of his robots accompanied 
him, a good enough army for al- 
most any emergency. 

A visual pickup showed 
him the scene at McDermott 
Keep. The robots were filing out, 
•a army of black ants cluster-

^ ing around the great gate. He 
could see them marching east- 
ward, vanishing from sight 
beyond the house. A robot over- 
head reported that they were 
heading for the river by the 
dozens. 

rr^he miles flew past. Black, 
twisted trees poked through 
the snow, and Holt’s car weaved 
a way through them. Far below, 
under many feet of whiteness, 
lay the fertile fields. In the 
spring all would be green. The 
leafy trees would help to shield 
the view of McDermott Keep, 
though they could not hide it al- 
together. In winter, the ugly 
copper-colored house was totally 
visible. That made the winters 
all the more difficult for Holt to 
endure. 

A robot said softly, “We are 
approaching’ the borderlands, 
your lordship.’’ 

“Try a test shot to see if his 
screens are still down.” 

“Shall I aim for the house?” 

“No. A tree.” 

Holt watched. A thick- 
boled, stubby tree in McDer- 
mott’s front palisade gleamed a 
moment, and then was gone. 

“The screens are still down,” 
the robot reported. 

“All right. Let’s cross the bor- 
der.” 

He leaned back against the 
cushion. The car shot forward. 



They left the bounds of Holt’s 
own estate, now, and entered 
McDermott’s. 

There was no warning ping to 
tell them they were trespassing. 
McDermott had even turned off 
the boundary scanners, then. 
Holt pressed sweaty palms to- 
gether. More than ever now he 
felt that he had let himself be 
drawn into some sort of trap. 
There was no turning back now. 
He was across the border, into 
McDermott’s own territory. Bet- 
ter to die boldly, he thought, 
than to live huddled in a shell. 

He had never been this 
close to McDermott Keep before. 
When it was being built, Mc- 
Dermott had invited him to in- 
spect it, but Holt had of course 
refused. Nor had he been to the 
housewarming. Alone among the 
lords of the planet, he had 
stayed home to sulk. He could 
hardly even remember when he 
had last left his own land at all. 
There were few places to go on 
this world, with its fifty estates 
of great size running through 
the temperate belt. When- 
ever Holt thirsted for the com- 
panionship of any of his fellow 
lords, which was not often, he 
could have it easily enough via 
telescreen. Some of them came 
to him, now and then. 

It was strange that when he 
finally did stir to pay a call, it 
should be a call on McDermott.

Drawing near the enemy 
keep, he found himselT reluc- 
tantly admitting that it was less 
close range than it seemed 
from the windows of Holt Keep. 
It was a great blocky building, 
hundreds of yards long, with a 
tall octagonal tower rising out 
of its northern end, a metal 
spike jabbing perhaps five 
hundred feet high. The reflected 
afternoon light, bouncing from 
the snowfield, gave the metal- 
sheathed building a curiously 
oily look, not unattractive at this 
distance. 

“We are within the outer de- 
fense perimeter,” a robot told 
Holt. 

“Keep going.” 

The robots sounded worried 
and perturbed, he thought. Of 
course, they weren’t pro- 
grammed to show much emo- 
tional range, but he could detect 
a note of puzzlement in what 
they said and how they said it. 
They couldn’t understand this at 
all. It did not seem to be an in- 
vasion of McDermott Keep — 
that they could have understood. 
But it was not a friendly visit, 
either. The robots did not know 
what to make of this journey. 

They were not alone in their 
confusion at this most unusual 
situation, Holt thought grimly. 
He sat back nervously as he and 
his guardian robots were swiftly 
carried forward. 

160

■f T^hen they were a hundred 
^ ’ yards from the great gate 
of McDermott Keep, the doors 
swung wide. Holt called McDer- 
mott and said, “See that those 
doors stay open all the time I’m 
here. If they begin to close, 
there’ll be trouble.” 

McDermott said, “Don’t 
worry. I’m not planning any 
tricks.” 

Holt’s car shot- between the 
gate walls, and he knew 
that now he was at his enemy’s 
mercy in earnest. His car rolled 
up to the open carport, and 
went on through, so that now he 
was actually within McDermott 
Keep. His robots followed him 
through. 

“May I close the carport?” 
“Keep it open!” Holt said. “I 
don’t mind the cold.” 

The hood of his car swung 
back. His robots helped him out. 
Holt shivered momentarily as 
the cold outside air, filtering in- 
to the carport, touched him. 
Then he passed through the iris- 
ing inner door and, flanked by 
two sturdy robots, walked slowly 
but doggedly into the Keep. 

McDermott’s voice reached 
him over a loudspeaker. “I am 
on the third floor of the tower,” 
he said. “If I had not sent all 
the robots away, I could have let 
CMie of them guide you.”

J “You could send a member of 
^ ! your family down,” Holt said 
\ sourly. 

i McDermott ignored that. 
“Continue down the corridor 
luitil it turns. Go past the armor 
room. You will reach a drop- 
shaft that leads upward.” 
i Holt and his robots moved 
; through the silent halls. 

The place was li’ .e a museum. 
The dark, high-vaulted corridor 
was lined with statuary and ar- 
tifacts, everything musty-looking 
and depressing. How could any- 
one want to live in a tomb like 
this? Holt passed a shadowy 
room where ancient suits of ar- 
mor stood mounted. He could 
not help but compute the cost of 
shipping such useless things 
across the light-years from 
Earth. 

They came to the dropshaft. 
Holt and his two robots entered, 
j A robot nudged the reversing 
I stud, and up they went, into the 
^ tower Holt had hated so long,

word or two. 

They passed down a long hall 
whose dull, dark walls were set 
: off by a gleaming floor that 
|. looked like onyx. A sphincter 
opened, admitting them to an 
oval room ringed by windows, 
exhaling a dry, foul stench of 
death and decay. 

Andrew McDermott sat 
squarely in the middle of the 

, NEIGHBOR 



room, nesting in his life-capsule. 
A tangled network of tubes and 
pipes surrounded him. All oi 
McDermott that was visible was 
a pair of eyes, two shining coals 
in the wasted face. 

tcT’m glad you came,” Mc- 
-i- Dermott said. His voice, 
without . benefit of electronic 
amplification, was thin and 
feeble, like the sound of feathers 
brushing through the air. 

Holt stared at him in fascina- 
tion. “I never thought I’d see 
this room,” he said. 

“I never though you would 
either. But it was good of you to 
come. Holt. You look well, you 
know. For a man your age.” The 
thin lips curled in a grotesque 
twisted smile. “Of course, you’re 
still a youngster. Not even two 
hundred yet. I’ve got you by 
thirty-odd years.” 

Holt did not feel like listen- 
ing to the older man’s ram- 
blings. “What is it you wanted?” 
he asked without warmth. “I’m 
here, but I’m not going to stay 
all day. You said you had some- 
thing vital to tell me.” 

“Not really to tell,” McDer- 
mott said. “More to ask. A favor, 
I want you to kill me. Holt.” 
“What?” 

“It’s very simple. Disconnect 
my feed line. There it is, right 
by my feet. Just rip it out. I’ll b* 
dead in an hour. Or do it even 

161 



more quickly. Turn off my lungs. 
This switch, right here. That 
would be the humane way.” 
“You have a strange sense of 
humor,” Holt said. 

“Do you think so? Top the 
joke, then. Throw the switch and 
cap the jest.” 

“You made me come all the 
way here to kill you?” 

“Yes,” McDermott said. The 
bla2ing eyes were unblinking 
now. “I’ve been immobili2ed for 
a year now. I’m a vegetable in 
this thing. I sit here day after 
day, idle, bored. And healthy. I 
might live another hundred 
years — do you reali2e that. 
Holt? I’ve had a stroke, yes. I’m 
paraly2ed. But my body’s still 
vigorous. This damned capsule 
of mine keeps me in tone. It 
feeds me and exercises me and 
— do you think I want to go on 
living this way, Holt? Would 
you?” 

Holt shrugged. “If you want 
to die, you could ask someone in 
your family to unplug you.” 

“I have no family.” 

“Is that true? You had five 
sons — ” 

“Four dead. Holt. The other 
one gone to Earth. No one lives 
here any more. I’ve outlasted 
them all. I’m as eternal as the 
heavens. Two hundred thirty 
years, that’s long enough to live. 
My wives are dead, my grand- 
children gone away. They’ll 



come home when they find 
they’ve inherited. Not before. 
There’s no one here to throw 
the switch.” 

“Your robots,” Holt suggested. 

Again the grim smile. “You 
must have special robots. Holt. I 
don’t have any that can be 
tricked into killing their master. 
I’ve tried it. They know what’ll 
happen if my life-capsule is dis- 
connected. They won’t do it. 
You do it. Holt! Turn me off. 
Blow the tower to hell, if it 
bothers you. You’ve won the 
game. The pri2e is yours.” 

i^'T^here was a dryness in 
Holt’s throat, a band of pres- 
sure across his chest. He tottered 
a little. 

His robots, ever sensitive to 
his condition, steadied him and 
guided him to a chair. He had 
been on his feet a long time for 
a man of his age. He sat quiet- 
ly until the spasm passed. 

Then he said, “I won’t do it.” 

“Why not?” 

“It’s too simple, McDermott. 
I’ve hated you too long. I can’t 
just flip a switch and turn you 
off.” 

“Bombard me, then. Blast the 
tower down!” 

“Without provocation? Do 
3'ou think I’m a criminal?” Hclt 
asked. 

“What do you want me to do?” 
McDermott said tiredly. “Order 



162

V 



my robots to trespass? Set fire 
to your orchards? What will 
provoke you. Holt?” 

“Nothing,” Holt said. “I don’t 
want to kill you. Get someone 
else to do it.” 

The eyes glittered. “You 
devil,” McDermott said. “You 
absolute devil. I never realized 
how much you hated me. I send 
for you in a time of need, asking 
to be put out of my misery, and 
will you grant me that? Oh, no. 
Suddenly you get noble. You 
won’t kill me! You devil, I see 
right through you. You’ll go 
back to your keep and gloat be- 
cause I’m a living dead man 
here. You’ll chuckle to yourself 
because I’m alone and frozen in- 
to this capsule. Oh, Holt, it’s not 
right to hate so deeply! I admit 
I’ve given offense. I deliberately 
built the tower here to wound 
your pride. Punish me, then. 
Take my life. Destroy my tower. 
Don’t leave me here!” 

Holt was silent. He moistened 
his Hps, filled his lungs with 
breath, got to his feet. He stood 
straight and tall, towering over 
the capsule that held his enemy. 

“Throw the switch,” McDer- 
mott begged. 

“I’m sorry.” 

“Devil!” 

Holt looked at his robots. “It’s 
time to go,” he said. “There’s no 
need for you to guide us. We can 
find our way out.” 



i^T^he teardrop-shaped car 
sped across shining snow. 
Holt said nothing as he made 
the return journey. 

His mind climg to the image 
of the immobilized McDermott, 
and there was no room for any 
other thought. That stench of 
decay that tingled in his nostrils 
— that glint of madness in the 
eyes as they begged for oblivion. 

They were crossing the bor- 
derlands now. Holt’s car broke 
the warning barrier and got a 
pinging signal to halt and iden- 
tify. A robot gave the password, 
and they went on toward Holt 
Keep. 

His family clustered near the 
entrance, pale, mystified. Holt 
walked in under his own steam. 
They were bursting with ques- 
tions, but no one dared ask any- 
thing. It remained for Holt to 
say the first word. 

He said, “McDermott’s a sick, 
crazy old man. His family is 
dead or gone. He’s a pathetic 
and disgusting sight. I don’t 
want to talk about the visit.” 

Sweeping past them. Holt as- 
cended the shaft to the com- 
mand room. He peered out, over 
the snowy field. There was a 
double track in the snow, lead- 
ing to and from McDermott 
Keep, and the sunlight blazed 
in the track.

The building shuddered sud- 
denly. Holt heard a hiss and a 
whine. He flipped on his com- 
cnunicator and a robot voice 
said, “McDermott Keep is at- 
tacking, your lordship. We’ve 
deflected a high - energy bom- 
bardment.” 

“Did the screens have any 
trouble with it?” 

“No, your lordship. Not at all. 
Shall I prepare for a counterat- 
tack?” 

Holt smiled. “No,” he said. 
“Take defensive measures only. 
Extend the screens right to the 
border and keep them there. 
Don’t let McDermott do any 
harm. He’s only trying to pro- 
voke me. But he won’t succeed.” 

The tall, gaunt man walked to 
the control panel. His gnarled 
hands rested lovingly on the 
equipment. So they had come to 
warfare at last, he thought. The 
cannon of McDermott Keep 
were doing their puny worst. 
Flickering needles told the 
story: whatever McDermott was 
throwing was being absorbed 
easily. He didn’t have the fire- 
power to do any real harm. 

Holt’s hands tightened on the 
controls. Now, he thought, he 
could blast McDermott Keep to 
ash. But he would not do it, any 
more then he would have 
thrown the switch that would 
have ended Andrew McDer- 
mott’s life. 



TLyffcDermott did not un- 
derstand. Not cruelty, but 
simple selfishness, had kept him 
from killing the enemy lord. 
Just as, all these years. Holt had 
refrained from launching an at- 
tack he was certain to win. He 
felt remotely sorry for the para- 
lyzed man locked in the life- 
capsule. But it was inconceiv- 
able that Holt would kill him. 

Once you are ^ne, Andrew, 
who will I have to hate? 

That was why he had not 
killed. For no other reason. 

Michael Holt peered through 
the foot-thick safety glass of his 
command room window. He saw 
the zone of brown earth, the 
snowfield with its fresh track, 
and the coppery ugliness of Mc- 
Dermott Keep. His intestines 
writhed at the hideousness of 
that baroque tower against 
the horizon. He imagined the 
skyline as it had looked a hun- 
dred years ago, before McDer- 
mott had built his foul keep. 

He fondled the controls of his 
artillery bank as though they 
were a young girl’s breasts. Then 
he turned, slowly and stiffly, 
making his way across the com- 
mand room to his chair, and sat 
quietly, listening to the sound of 
Andrew McDermott’s futile 
bombardment expending it- 
self against the outer defenses of 
Holt Keep as the winter night 
fell.— ROBERT SILVERBERG.

I turned again to be sure the

bluff. I selected an arrow and 
fitted it to my bow and cautious- 
ly walked out across the hot 
glade of teree grass. In the far 
thicket the charl boar grubbed 
and snorted unconcernedly. 

Pack at the lodge, a day’s walk 
from here, all my elite people 
had paused and were concentrat- 
ing telepathically on our minds 
here. Through my eyes, through 
my son’s eyes, through the eyes 



of the nontelepathic bearers on 
the bluff, they watched this 
scene, alerted by our tension. 

My third wife, the dainty little 
one from Kewananga, stopped 
her romping with the children 
and hushed them. Innocently, 
she censured me. 

“You should not have taken 
your son on this dirty killing. ’ 

My chief wife, the boy’s moth- 
er, was not speaking to me. 

My father, aging beside the 
small fire in his room of memo- 
ries, whispered to me in excite- 
ment. “Careful, son. He’s a big 
brute. Hear the weight of him 
when he moves.” 

Red Giant boiled hugely in 
the afternoon sky as if he trem- 
bled to engulf his tiny companion 
sun, White Dwarf. In this glade 
the pink teree grass reflected the 
red sunlight and shimmered om- 
inously. 

I glanced back one last time 
at my son. In that instant, I saw 
that he was not yet the “young 
man” I had thought to bring on 
his first hunt. He was just a slim 
boy confused by his noodle-head- 
ed mother. Well, it was too late 
now to leave him home as he and 
his mother had wished. 

The charl boar would have 
scented us long ago except for 
the pungent odor of the giant 
fungus he was grubbing. Now, I 
penetrated too far into the bitter- 
sweet aroma that drifted from 



the thicket. I felt the old thrill 
race along my back, and I glanc- 
ed reassuringly across to my son. 

His sudden thought shook me — 
far more than the sonic boom 
that came at that moment from 
some Matterist rocket beyond 
the Guapanga mountains. The 
boar, monstrous and unstoppable, 
charged from the thicket. 

My son’s task was to put an 
arrow into his driving rear flank. 
He was to yell and divert him 
toward the tree. He did neither. 
He threw down his bow and 
swung into the tree. 

There was no place for me to 
run. The bearers were yelling 
from the rock . with no effect 
on the boar. Flashing toward me 
across the teree grass, the boar 
held the gleaming tusks high. A 
greasy chill clutched my belly 
while I cursed my chief wife 
with my mouth and with my 
mind. 

The boar’s head went down 
and I drew the bow. I watched 
the heaving spot at the base of 
his massive shoulder hump where 
the gray bristles make a swirl. 
There is an opening there. A 
spear will not enter it, but a man 
may sometimes put an arrow 
through it and sever the spinal 
cord. 

I did. His front legs buckled. 
The great rump with its shoddy 
flag of a tail vaulted at me. I 
was knocked flat and the car- 



166 



GALAXY 





cass crashed painfully across my 
legs. 

At his shoulder t^s boar had 
stood almost as high as a man. I 
lay waiting for the bearers to 
get him off me. I looked up at 
the churning surface of Red 
Giant and marveled that I was 
still alive. 

A fter I was standing, the head 
bearer grasped my arms in 
the traditional gesture but he 
avoided my eyes. He said, “Tawe 
tawa,” which scholars say once 
meant, “Hunter of hunters,” in 
the primitive vocal language. 

The other bearers were blank- 
faced and they did not dance 
on the carcass or pass wine. I 
looked down on the charl boar 
. certainly the greatest I had 
ever killed. 

I yelled with my mind and 
did not care that elite Guapanga 
might hear: “Woman! Because 
of your nuts-and-fruit thinking, 
I cannot mount this shameful 
head in our lodge!” 

The chief bearer, knowing only 
the silence in the glade, took out 
his steel knife and began expert- 
ly to dress the animal. The other 
bearers got in his way helping. 
They were anxious to avoid my 
eyes. Their atelepathic minds 
cringed from the probing they 
hoped I was gentlemanly enough 
not to make. 

I felt my face bum. I looked 



over to where my eldest son 
stood. Because of this boy’s 
mother and the radical Mentalist 
thinking she had recently sub- 
scribed to, none of my three 
wives now admitted me to their 
rooms. Because of this boy and 
his goose of a mother, I was al- 
most dead with a tusk from groin 
to throat. 

I walked over to where his 
mind seethed with sactimoni- 
ous pride in his absurd Mentalist 
extremes, and with horror at the 
sight of the great boar bearing 
down on me. 

The words in this confusion 
were, “I did what I knew at the 
last moment I had to do. I tried 
to explain my Mentalist princi- 
ples to you and you wouldn’t 
listen. My mother has condoned 
my decision.” 

Abruptly, my chief wife was 
in my mind, horrified at what 
had almost happened to me, pro- 
tective of the boy and still stub- 
born with righteousness. “Our 
son will devote his life to build- 
ing our beautiful Mentalist heri- 
tage. He cannot taint himself 
with killing.” 

I heard a groan from my lips. 
“Leave us, woman.” 

Now she wept. From the bench 
were she sat in the courtyard of 
the lodge the paving stones blur- 
red as though in rain, and her 
mouth cried out, “My husband, 
we have almost killed you. For- 



168

give us. The boy had never seen 
a live boar. He did not know. 
Forgive me, and I will give i p 
my thinking.” 

“Leave us.” 

“You were dying and you curs- 
ed me before the elite world.” 
“Leave us.” 

T stood hot- eyed before the boy. 

I am a conservative Mentalist 
— which is the conservative par- 
ty in the first place. I know ex- 
actly what the Matterists are 
after — and I am dead against 
It. I do not allow the use of any 
machines anywhere on my lands. 
My grandfather fought against 
the vote for women until the 
radical Mentalists finally beat 
him fifty years ago. To this day 
no elite woman from Guapanga 
casts a vote. 

Among conservative Mental- 
ists, I am rockbound conserva- 
tive. To the radicals, I am “The 
Mountain Ogre.” Now I faced a 
cowardly son because radical 
women’s thinking had entered 
my own household. I was about 
as dead politically as a man can 
get and still cast a vote. 

Even as I stood there I could 
hear the first repercussions of 
this shameful incident snickering 
off into the Mentalist world. “Oh, 
didn’t he turn out to be an ogre 
at home?” “Well, you must ad- 
mit, he’s great with boars.” 
Another Matterist passenger

rocket screamed overhead. Its 
parting thunder boomed back 
from the gorges of Guapanga. 
This irritating sound was, as they 
say, the gem that sank the boat. 
I slapped the boy. 

Yet, even as my helpless rage 
propelled the hand, I felt my 
own guilt slow it. 

Afterward, it was not a time 
to admit that feeling of guilt. It 
was time — and far too late a 
time — to start contradicting his 
mother’s thinking. 

With my mind I said to him, 
“Very well. All is mind. Matter 
is an illusion. But a mental charl 
boar can kill a mental man as 
surely as if he were material. 
And a mental son has a duty to 
his mental father.” 

Now his shame dominated his 
confusion and he bawled. I went 
on, “The Mentalist culture of 
which you are so proud will not 
protect your feet from stones, 
while this boar will make shoes 
for the whole lodge. You must 
eat meat and meat must be 
kiUed.” 

Stubbornly, through his shame, 
he echoed his mother. “The kill- 
ing should be done by common 
men, not by a Mentalist.” 
These Mentalist fads and cults, 
such as the one my chief wife 
was dabbling in, had grown only 
in the last five years since the 
Chupa Uprisings. They were un- 
healthy signs of the shock and 



169 



fear left in us by the unexpected 
revolt of the chupas. 

I shook my head. “Arm your 
tenants and train them to hunt? 
One day you will find them hunt- 
ing you.” I reached out and grip- 
ped his arm. “Your grandfather 
built this Mentalist empire here 
in the Guapangas, sprang be- 
tween two Matterist republics. 
Geographically and spiritually it 
must be the most Mentalist of 
empires. It must be the conserva- 
tive stronghold. And that means, 
among many other things, killing 
your own meat.” 

Now I was through with him. 
I was not quite in a mood to 
start making a chum of him. 
“You will return with the bear- 
ers. I am going back alone.” 

I walked over to the bearers. 
“The boy will return with you.” 
The head bearer looked me in 
the eye now and nodded respect- 
fully. “Yes, Excellency.” 

II 

T7rom that high valley at the 
^ feet of the Guapangas, I 
followed a great conifered ridge 
that borders my lands. I walked 
in telepathic solitude, angry and 
ashamed. 

In the late afternoon I arrived 
at a craggy mountain that stands 
apart from its parent Guapangas. 
There the ridge begins to drop 
toward my lodge. At the base of 



this moimtain there is a little 
lake and I stopped and bathed. 
Afterward, I lay on the grassy 
bank and watched a herd of 
greathoms high on the mountain 
as they made their dainty way 
from one perilous coign to an- 
other. 

I became aware of the ap- 
proach of a Matterist. We both, 
ceremonially closed our minds. 

“I pass your mind in peace. 
May Mr. Executive shield us 
both.” 

“I withdraw my mind with re- 
spect. I commend you to Old 
Man.” 

The present political divisions, 
Matterists and Mentalists, were 
left after all of the ancient tele- 
pathic cultures had fused or been 
annihilated. In the meantime 
there had evolved the institution 
of the Old Man. (The priggish 
Matterists call him Mr. Execu- 
tive, but he is still just Old Man.) 

The Old Man is one mind 
which stands between the two 
planet-wide political parties and 
acts as final law for both. Our 
greatest political crisis comes 
when an Old Man dies. Then 
hurriedly come the two planet- 
wide telepathic conventions — 
the building of the two new plat- 
forms — the election of two op- 
T'osing candidates (one of which 
will become the new Old Man) 
— and finally, the moment of 
“war”. 



170 



GALAXY 



In the truce after the “war” 
the candidate of the victors cau- 
tiously contacts the minds of the 
defeated. With utmost care he 
synthesizes a pragmatic position 
for himself embracing, if he is a 
Mentalist, one after another of 
the Matterist points of faith, as 
“beliefs necessary to the well- 
being of my Matterist subjects.” 
At the same time he rarefies his 
former Mentalist beliefs into 
pragmatic notions necessary to 
“guide my actions and obtain my 
ends as Old Man.” 

Now his one mind handles the 
two conflicting faiths in a logical 
manner, and for his lifetime he 
keeps the peace. 

He keeps the peace absolutely 
because none may plot against 
him for a moment. Awake or 
asleep, and without any bother 
on his part, his mind would auto- 
matically shunt contradictory be- 
liefs into the mind of the plotter 
and thus confuse him complete- 
ly- 

I rose from the grass and 
dressed to meet the Matterist. 

I t was some time before he ap- 
peared around a wooded knoll. 
He had with him two bearers 
who carried the carcass of a 
greathom. The beautiful curving 
horns were the color of nut 
meats. 

His machine-made clothing 
was drab and unpretentious com- 

THE DHEGATE FROM GUAPANGA 



pared to the elegance of my cap 
and tunic, the silk of my 
breeches and the handsomely 
tooled leather of my boots. He 
wore the usual unadorned clothes 
and his machine-made boots 
were plain. 

He was a neighbor of mine. 
As I looked to the south down 
his valley, I could see the ugly 
smudge from his pulp mills and 
paper factories. (The Matterists 
have a type of daily reading they 
are addicted to instead of enjoy- 
ing books. Everything that has 
happened that day in their so- 
ciety, endless minutiae you 
would never pause over in tele- 
pathic scanning, they read about 
in the evening. They require 
enormous amounts of cheap pap- 
er to keep up this “papernews”.) 

The Matterist apologized' un- 
necessarily. “I hope you don’t 
mind that I pass through this 
part of your land. It is the only 
way I can get to the greathoms 
of this mountain. 

I spread my hands. “You are 
welcome at any time.” 

Naturally we did not touch, 
and of course we spoke only 
with our mouths. Our minds 
were closed to each other. He 
was carrying a high-powered rifle 
with a telescopic sight The tele- 
scope excited me. We may build 
telescopes to study Lalone and 
the other planets and moons. But 
to build or use a sight with which 



171 



to kill would be a Matterist here- 
by- 

I glanced up at the face of the 
mountain and found the herd of 
greathorns. “May I use your 
sight?” 

Knowing I should not touch 
the rifle, he graciously dismount- 
ed the sight and handed it to 
me. 

It was a wonderful thrill to 
me to have the herd of great- 
horns leap into close perspective. 
I watched their frightful, sure- 
footed progress until retention of 
the sight became impolite. I re- 
turned it to him and he remount- 
ed it. Then he stood for a mo- 
ment looking at the rusty sky 
where Red Giant hovered over 
tire Guapangas. 

He said, “Well, this time to- 
morrow we will each probably 
be casting our vote for the next 
Mr. Executive.” 

I stared at him in a stupid 
pause. He saw the ignorance 
on my face. 

He said, “You must have spent 
tile day absorbed in some very 
disturbing personal problem.” 

I focused in panic on the mind 
of Old Man. 

He was dying. He had had a 
stroke and he was dying. The 
mountain beneath me rocked. 

We looked at each other, the 
Matterist and I, and each saw 
tiie other’s determination. 



“Why are you so stuDDom 
about this one thing? We only 
want to try it on one of them, 
and it is so far away.” 

I shook my head. “It is not 
just ‘one thing’. I do not want 
to be told how many wives I 
may have, when I should work, 
or what I may read.” 

He flushed. “The last three 
Executives have been Mentalist 
candidates. Yet with the coopera- 
tion of your radical Mentalists 
these Executives have been able 
to afford us much of the change 
we needed. Why not this? We 
only want to try it on one of 
them.” 

He referred to a distant, yellow 
sun where the Matterists want to 
invade and colonize one of the 
planets. They have a theory that 
life is at its best imder yellow 
suns. Three times now this am- 
bition of theirs to colonize plan- 
ets of yellow suns had been de- 
layed because we had won the 
“war” and placed a Mentalist as 
Old Man. 

This is the reason we Mental- 
ists will not allow improvements 
in technology until we have im- 
proved our own souls. We see 
in the Matterists how the de- 
structiveness of their engines has 
outstripped their ability to con- 
trol themselves. They rationalize 
the crime they wish to carry out 
with the wide-eyed innocence of 
anim als. It is to be only “one” 



172 



GALAXY 



experiment ... at least until it 
has proved successful. That little 
insignificant yellow sun is so far 
away. Those distant semi-ration- 
als who call their planet “Erth” 
do not even telepath. It is all so 
innocent and “progressive”. 

I said coldly, “I think your 
soul has plenty of room to im- 
prove right here under Red Giant 
and White Dwarf.” 

His face went rigid with anger. 
He saluted me stiffly and he and 
his bearers moved on. 

T contacted my father-in-law in 
Basahn at once. “Councillor, 

I have had some personal prob- 
lems. I did not realize . .” 

He is my chief wife’s father. 
He said, “Yes, I have had tear- 
ful news of those problems. I 
reminded your wife that I would 
not tolerate her behavior myself 
and do not expect you to. In the 
name of my family, I apologize.” 
He proceeded bluntly to the 
plans for the Mentalist conven- 
tion where he would certainly be 
the outstanding nominee for Old 
Man. He is a vigorous old lecher 
who keeps three wives and three 
concubines happy and still drinks 
a full gourd of wesah spirits a 
day. “I am sorry to say that your 
‘charl boar incidenti has made 
you a laughing stock. There is 
now no chance to get you on 
the Council of Pragmatists until 
next fall.” 



“Yes, sir. I understand.” 
“Nevertheless, your voters are 
among the best trained in the 
Mentalist party, and your prag- 
matic stand is very important to 
us.” 

“Yes, sir. I am aware.” 
“Begin contacting your elite 
people at once. Old Man has ral- 
lied momentarily, but the end 
might come suddenly.” 

“I will do so.” 

Ill 

T had no desire to be in this part 
of my lands with elections 
coming up. The moment Old 
Man was dead, the Matterists 
would be able to send out groups 
of atelepathic non-voters carry- 
ing rifles and explosives to pick 
off our elite people. 

For this they cannot of course 
spare elite people from the vot- 
ing and the “war”. Also they 
cannot use highly destructive, 
nuclear weapons, because the 
geography of the two parties is 
so interlaced. They can only be 
picky with such killing, but I 
did not intend to be “picked”. 

While I walked and trotted, I 
contacted my party lieutenants 
and instructed them in the 
grouping of our voters along their 
convictions in pragmatism. My 
voters would, of course, be vot- 
ing for the things I believe in. 
Any man that didn’t would find 



THE DELEGATE FROM GUAPANGA

himself off my lands next day, 
packing his wife and kids for the 
polar mines. 

Until this morning, when my 
chief wife had made a planet- 
wide ass of me, I had been a 
powerful force in our Mentalist 
party. I had campaigned several 
years now for her father who 
owns much of Basahn beyond 
the Guapangas. 

I invented his campaign slo- 
gan, “A man who believes in 
nothing makes a great Old Man.” 

Night before last, while my 
son and 1 were at camp on our 
inglorious charl boar hunt, I had 
made a scheduled speech that 
was listened to across the planet 
by all Mentalists. My pragma- 
tism was naturally cheered by 
conservative Mentalists and hiss- 
ed by radical Mentalists., But 
the most heartening response had 
been from the chupas. These 
children from the union of an 
elite person with a common, 
atelepathic person (usually a 
concubine), lacks nothing in in- 
telligence and they telepath as 
well as elite people. Like the 
common people, however, they 
have minds of their own. Each 
chupa is a little culture to him- 
self, completely independent. 

They are realists, first and 
last, and seem always pragmatic. 
They like me. Now, since the 
Uprisings, they had become im- 
portant politically. 



"Delow the ridge the streaking 
lights of Matterist cars be- 
gan to glow along their highway. 

Only a few years ago Old Man 
had granted them this highway 
which crossed part of my land. 
It was not the least part of my 
disgust with the radical Mental- 
ists that, to spite me, they had 
provided Old Man the necessary 
balance of opinion in this matter 
and allowed the desecration of a 
virgin Mentalist forest. 

The moon nearest our planet, 
the little yellow one we call Fal- 
on the Messenger, came rocket- 
ing up in the east. By its waxy 
light I was able to descend at 
the proper point to the highway 
and cross under it through one 
of the wide tunnels which had 
been provided for moving wild- 
life. Above me the cars whistled 
on their pavement. The Matter- 
ist minds they carried were still 
closed to us, but they, too, were 
hurrying to be ready for Old 
Man’s death. 

As I came out of the tunnel, I 
became aware that the young 
Chupa overseer of my lands was 
on his way to meet me with a 
lantern. I was pleased that he 
had not delegated this to an 
atelepathic on this dangerous 
night. 

He called to me with his 
strong, cheerful mind. “Excellen- 
cy, I have just crossed the creek 
above Serapon Marsh. On Skull 



174 



GALAXY 



Hill I will swing a lantern until 
you sight me.” 

“I am climbing toward Skull 
Hill now. We will meet there.” 
I envied him, the chupa. He is 
now a lieutenant in my political 
organization and a good one. In 
this election he would work hard 
for me, though he had fought 
skillfully against me in the Chu- 
pa Uprisings. He was not the 
least ashamed of the Uprisings 
and, unlike many in the Mental- 
ist elite, I do not hold those days 
against the chupas. The improve- 
ments in their station which they 
then gained had been due. After 
all, we in the elite worlds have 
only our own moral laxity to 
blame for the fact that there 
are chupas. 

T^rom the chupa lieutenant’s 
mind came a solemn remark. 
“I, too, do not know for sure. 
But I would be honored if it 
were so.” 

The open minds which he and 
I kept with each other were oc- 
casionally embarrassing. It had 
passed through my mind that 
this chupa’s mother had died 
without telling, but many have 
claimed that my own father was 
her elite lover. 

One thing was sure, my father 
kept a stingy grip on that part 
of his memories. 

I mounted the pass below the 
great rock skull that was bathed 



in the tallow light of Falrn. His 
lantern came swinging toward me 
and he laughed with his mouth. 
“I saw your thatch before you 
saw my lantern.” 

I had taken off my cap, leav- 
ing my red hair loose. 

The subtle mixture of lantern 
light and moonglow showed his 
firm features grinning at me. We 
grasped thumbs affectionately 
and started back the way he had 
come. 

I noticed that when he was 
not speaking directly with his 
mind it closed rhythmically 
against me. I understood he 
would protect me against his 
thoughts about my son and chief 
wife. 

I focused at once on my son’s 
mind and spoke firmly but cheer- 
fully. “How is your camp?” 

“It is good, father. We are 
about half way back to the lodge 
from the high valleys.” 

“Have you seen to the com- 
fort of your bearers?” 

“Yes, we . .” He paused and 
continued meekly, “We are broil- 
ing part of the boar and will eat 
soon.” 

“You realize that the Mental- 
ist convention could start at any 
minute. Since you are not of 
voting age, close your mind at 
once and remain that way until 
contacted.” 

“Yes, father. I will do so." 

The chupa shifted his lantern 

175 



THE DELEGATE FROM GUAPANGA 



to his other hand and put his 
free arm on my shoulder. “I 
knew you wovild not continue to 
be harsh with the boy. It was not 
his fault, and he would never do 
it again.” 

Momentarily, the picture of 
thrashing a naked woman with 
a stick was embarrassingly sharp 
in his mind. He hastened his 
thinking to the words, “Of 
course, I have no rightful 
thoughts on whose fault it might 
have been.” 

As we started down the slopes 
above Serapon Marsh, he point- 
ed east where Garrison Bluff 
was drenched in moonlight. 

I nodded. The garrison was 
dark and deserted. My monks 
had already left their cells and 
each had departed alone for some 
impromptu retreat in the forest. 
There they would hold their con- 
victions against Matterism and 
vote steadily for Mentalism. 
When the brief moment of “war” 
came, their full telepathic force 
would be against the Matterist 
platform. So now, if a Matterist 
non-voter chose to blow up the 
garrison, little would be lost. 

A s the chupa and I came up 
the stone walk to the lodge, 
my father-in-law contacted me 
again. “Old Man has weakened 
so that Intelligence is able to 
study the possible Matterist 
platform. I am confident that 



when the “war” comes we will 
win. If I am placed as Old Man 
I will ask immediately for you 
to be voted into the Council. 
You will lose due to that ridicu- 
lous chart boar business of this 
morning. However, I will keep 
asking and I am sure you will 
be voted in next fall.” 

My father-in-law withdrew his 
busy focus as the chupa and I 
passed beneath the autumn- 
spangled leera trees and entered 
the great stone-paved court of 
my lodge. I caught a glimpse of 
my chief wife hurrying along a 
portico in the waning light of 
Falon. Her robe blew about her 
fine figure in tallow folds that 
were mystically related to the 
wax-hard withdrawal of her 
proud mind. 

The chupa grasped thumbs 
with me. “May the Mentalists 
win again.” He saluted rrie ironi- 
cally and left. 

The lodge was dark and silent. 
The children were all asleep. The 
adults were awake and anxious 
about the convention. In his 
rooms off one of the upper porti- 
cos my aged father hummed to 
himself and dreamed of a con- 
vention and “war” in his youth. 
My second wife stirred uncom- 
fortably in bed with the big baby 
she was carrying and resented its 
father profoundly. She would not 
speak with me when I focused 
comfortingly on her mind. She 



176 



GALAXY 



knew that I never cared to speak 
with her except to persuade her 
to have big heavy babies with 
heads like red melons. 

A breeze moved through the 
trees and shrubs of the court. 
The splashing of the fountain 
was a great noise. The crackling 
of coals in the open cooking pit 
beyond the fountain was anoth- 
er noise. I found that I was de- 
sperately hungry. * 

Over the bed of coals the car- 
cass of a black horn sizzled. 
There was a loaf of bread and a 
skin of wine on the stone table. 

There were no servants to help 
me, of course. All the men were 
stationed about the grounds, 
guarding with bow and spear 
against the possible rifles and 
explosives of Matterist common 
people. Their women were hud- 
dled about their own cooking fire 
where they whispered the age- 
old superstitions about politics. 

I cut a huge piece of the meat 
and ate it with the bread, sitting 
at the stone serving table. I 
drank the wine directly from the 
skin, chewed ravenously and 
stared into the coals. 

My third wife, the little one 
from Kewananga, was no longer 
speaking with me, even to scold. 
She now sided completely with 
the chief wife whom I had curs- 
ed. 

I decided to bathe again when 
I had finished eating. I threw off 



my harness of arrows and my 
clothes and left them in a heap 
on the stones of the court I 
vaulted into the fountain, fright- 
ened the decorative fish into a 
shimmering explosion. Aftejrward 
I walked in angry nakednesa 
across the court and along the 
great portico to my rooms. 

' I 'he Matterists marry only one 
woman. I have often assum- 
ed from this basic stupidity 
springs the meanness of their cul- 
ture. This night I had learned 
that three women are no certain- 
ty of affection. 

Alone in my rooms, I shouted 
to all three of them with my 
mind, “Don’t worry that I will 
not return from this convention 
with a firm mind! I will come 
back here with a stick and beat 
two of you all the way to the 
Basahn Hills. I will save the stick 
and when the other had whelped 
I will stand in one spot and beat 
affection into her. Her heart 
will melt for man and child.” 

I threw on a cap and left my 
rooms and let my boots crash 
theatrically on the stones. I went 
up the stairs and along the up- 
per portico to my father’s rooms. 

He said with his mind, “Come 
in, son. After the convention I 
will come out on the portico to 
see you return with a stick. Then 
we will have peace and love 
about here once more.” 



THE DELEGATE FROM GUAPANGA 



177 



I entered and stood before 
him. To me his face will always 
be the most beautiful of my life. 
There is written in those deep 
seams a long life of building and 
adventure and care. It was he 
who had fought in three elections 
to win and place a Mentalist Old 
Man and prevent the Matterists 
from invading the planets of oth- 
er suns. It was he, too, who had 
counseled me during the Chupa 
Uprisings. The memory of his 
understanding in those days stir- 
red in me a sudden question. 

“Are you the father of my chu- 
pa?” 

He was angry with me. “You 
think of trivia in the presence of 
this ceremony!” 

I was ashamed. I had caught 
from his mind a hard ache of 
remembered love and a sweet 
face, and this I had tricked from 
him. But this thought left one 
certainty. It is a fine thing to 
love a woman who can’t read 
your mind. 

I gestured placatingly for the 
ceremony. 

All over our planet, where it 
was now light and where it was 
now dark, these ancient Mental- 
ist words were being spoken. The 
hands of an old man trembled on 
the kneeling young one and the 
primitive, almost meaningless 
words of mouth were said by the 
ancient. After these magical 
words of mouth one could go 



into the forest and lie on the 
ground and fight the telepatliic 
war. For, in ancient times, be- 
fore the institution of Old Man, 
the election was the war. 

I walked out of the lodge along 
the great portico which is sup- 
ported by thirteen caryatids 
carved as the demons spawned 
in “The Beginning” by White 
Dwarf. There my chief wife knelt 
on the stones and grasped my 
thighs. 

I did not put my hand on her 
dark and lovely head. She drew 
herself up my body and sought 
my lips. I did not refuse her 
this, but I could not return the 
kiss. Too clearly, gleaming tusks 
flashed in the teree grass. 

It was cruel and insulting. 
Salty with tears, her lips moaned 
away from me. She turned and 
clung to a caryatid and it was 
the female demon, Paline. I left 
her sobbing face imcomforted be- 
tween wooden breasts. 

IV 

autumn dawns start softly, 
a subtle, pink glowing with- 
out direction that grows and 
grows until suddenly day crashes 
in. Deep in a secret part of the 
forest I stood on a little emin- 
ence and leaned against a cold 
face of basalt. 

I have always attended the 
political conventions from this 



178 



GALAXY 



secret place in my forests. 
Through the enormous rusty 
glowing a great black chahar 
winged his heavy way. Even as 
I watched his flight he gave his 
screaming cry, and it was day. 
The first ray from Red Giant 
lanced the black belly of a cloud, 
splashing blood across the high 
cliffs of Guapanga. 

At that moment Old Man died. 

His hand, held by that of his 
chief wife, relaxed. Over his fad- 
ing telepathic fans, he muttered 
a name that was heard by wait- 
ing millions of us across the 
planet. Then he was dead. 

The Mentalist convention be- 
gan immediately. I walked over 
to a grassy knoll and lay down 
and closed my eyes. 

Throughout the morning of 
voting on issues and principles 
that would make up our plat- 
form, there whispered outside our 
minds the ominous workings of 
the Matterist convention where 
an opposing platform was taking 
shape. These foreign arguments 
and all this communication we 
kept firmly from our minds. The 
moment would come soon enough 
when we would face them with 
our platform and they would 
face us with theirs. And in less 
time than it takes to melt a 
scoop of butter over a fire, the 
logic of the stronger side would 
begin to confuse and dissolve 
the logic of the weaker side. 



This would be the moment of 
“war”. When it was finished one 
logic would stand intact across 
the planet and the victors would 
install the next Old Man. 

While we were busy building 
the Mentalist platform our chupa 
minds stood respectfully aside. 
For a chupa thinks independent- 
ly of the party platforms, just 
as a common man thinks pretty 
much as he pleases in his lonely 
world. But an elite man neces- 
sarily takes part in his telepathic 
culture (or, as we call it today, 
“platform”). It is the thing which 
forms his mental boundaries. 
Every elite person, upon the 
death of an Old Man, is deeply 
concerned with the changes that 
will occur in his allowable philo- 
sophy. 

Touring the morning my chupa 
half-brother contacted me. 
“Excellency, can you spare a 
moment? It is important.” 

“Of course, but you know not 
to keep me too long.” 

“I have been increasingly 
aware that you intend to enter 
again your plea for dishonest 
government.” 

“Yes, I do. I suppose it will 
make as little impression this 
time as it has in the past. But 
it is an essential part of my con- 
servatism and I can’t neglect it.” 
“Pardon me. Excellency. I 
think it wrill make a very definite 



THE DELEGATE FROM GUAPANGA 



179 



impression this time. We chupas, 
loyal to the Mentalists, have held 
a conference about it just now. 
We can promise you a solid vote 
for dishonesty in government.” 

I was stunned with pleasure. 
All morning, in the face of the 
general amusement over my first 
wife’s disloyalty, I had availed 
myself only of my routine vote. 
Now I saw that my political for- 
tune had turned in a moment. 

“You see. Excellency, what 
this could mean when the two 
platforms are face to face.” 
Lying in the cool forest, I op- 
ened my eyes and looked across 
the rusty sky, and closed them. 
With a thrilling start I under- 
stood him. The chupas on the 
Matterist side would like this 
part of our platform as much as 
our chupas. They would vote for 
this aspect of our platform. 

S hortly, the convention was at 
that point where the provin- 
cial law in Guapanga which for- 
bids voting to woman was caus- 
ing its usual trouble. A radical 
Mentalist from the east had the 
attention and was being particu- 
larly abusive. 

This maneuver was not intend- 
ed to do anything practical about 
the law itself. It was meant simp- 
ly to discredit me, Ae law’s chief 
defender, before I could propose 
any of my pragmatic aspects for 
our new platform. 



The radical" shouted, “Out 
there in those hills the women 
will try anything to get free.” 

This was the inevitable refer- 
ence to “the charl boar incident.” 
Everyone laughed, even the con- 
servatives. 

I held my peace. I would just 
have to wait my turn for atten- 
tion which I could now see would 
not come again until afternoon. 
But when my turn did come, I 
was going to rock them. 

I had been the first politician 
to see that pragmatism could be 
used within a party platform as 
well as by Old Man and the 
Council of Pragmatists. For ex- 
ample, I inovated having our 
common people vote against 
work. They continue to vote 
against work cheerfully and with 
great energy, knowing that they 
will be plowing their fields to- 
morrow. In our Mentalist plat- 
form a request for this vote is 
without difficulty, but in the fin- 
al facing of the two platforms 
this strong vote cannot be ab- 
sorbed by the Matterists to 
whom “work” must be the most 
important of virtues if they are 
to keep their factories going. 

The parts of the platform com- 
ing up did not require unusual 
action. I decided to leave and 
have lunch. I contacted one of 
my elite lieutenants and left my 
vote for him to proxy with in- 
■tructions for standard, conserva-

tive responses. Ii anything came 
up he had only to contact me. 

When I opened my eyes to the 
red forest, I found a young wom- 
an sitting on a rock near me. 
She rose and came toward me 
gracefully. She carried a freshly 
cut hasam gourd and in the other 
hand one of the huge hasam 
leaves folded as a pouch. 

She knelt before me and hand- 
ed me the gourd. “It is water 
from the creek.” She indicated 
the nearby sound of the stream. 

The water had, only a short 
time ago, splashed from the high 
snows of Guapanga. It made my 
teeth ache. 

She spread the huge hasam 
leaf before me and I found that 
she had provided for my lunch 
exactly as I had planned to do. 
She had gathered the autumn 
nuts and berries and several 
kinds of fruit. She had cracked 
and cleaned the nuts into a sep- 
arate smaller leaf. 

She was not telepathic, but 
she was an unusual beauty. Her 
features were sensual without 
being soft. I watched with pleas- 
ure the grace of her walk. 

I asked with my mouth, “Who 
sent you here?” 

“No one sent me.” 

“Did you know I would be 
here?” 

She smiled mysteriously. “I 
knew.” 

She picked up some of the 
THE DELEGATE FROM GUAPANGA 



fruit for herself, a bunch of ice- 
blue wesah. Then she indicated 
the meal with her head. 

“Eat, Excellency. You will 
have to get back to the conven- 
tion.” 

I did not wish to think about 
the speech I would give in the 
afternoon. Instinct told me I 
would destroy essential spontani- 
ty. I welcomed this woman as a 
diversion. 

She sat and munched the we- 
sah while I ate the meal and 
drank from the gourd. We watch- 
each other in appreciative sil- 
ence and grinned occasionally. 

' I 'he little ginkas, both the red 
and the blue-furred ones, 
were gathering nuts beneath the 
red trees. In the forest there was 
only their chatter and the occa- 
sional belling of a black jay. 

When she was satisfied that I 
was through eating, she asked, 
“Excellency, why doesn’t your 
chief wife come to you?” 

I saw that the common people, 
as well as the elite, knew of my 
problems. “You know it is un- 
lawful for a delegate to be with 
his women during a convention.” 
She pretended to be naive. 
“Why is that. Excellency?” 

“It used to be thought they 
might influence one’s vote. Now 
they just vote ‘contrary to one.” 
“And yet. Excellency, you may 
ask me to your arms.” 



181 



I did not like her brazen calm. 
“That is not proper at any time.” 
Her strange smile angered me. 
tl was about to order her away 
when she raised her arms and 
ttmdid the knot of her honey- 
colored hair so that it fell to her 
shoulders as girls wear their hair 
before marriageable age. 

“Do you recognize me, Excel- 
lency? Wasn’t there a time dur- 
ing the telepathic fighting of the 
chupas when you felt less harsh- 
ly against my company.” 

Then I recognized her. She 
was the daughter of one of my 
tenants. While I had rested from 
fighting the chupas five years 
ago, she had happened by here. 

She smiled. It was entirely a 
forgiving smile. “I was only a 
girl then. Excellency. I am a 
woman now. I have heard that 
your wives do not come to you, 
election day or not.” 

She declared this as bluntly as 
she might say, “I see that your 
red thatch needs trimming.” 

We sat there for some time, 
looking at each other through 
knowing lids while I remember- 
ed her sweet youth and felt a 
ravenous need for her. I beckon- 
ed her to me, and as I did so 
I realized that the air-tide of our 
planet was rising. 

Red Giant and White Dwarf 
were overhead. Together they 
draw an angry tide of storm 
through all our noons. 



Even as the woman knelt to 
me the first confused gusts of 
the tide whirled crimson leaves 
about us. Presently the tide rac- 
ed through the forest. It sang 
through bare autumn branches 
and half buried us in a drift of 
leaves. The woman’s warm 
mouth whispered over my face. 
Then, far away I heard the 
mighty wave of wind bellow into 
the gorges of Guapanga, shrilling 
in the wild crags. 

I lay dreaming. One day I 
would be Old Man. If I be- 
came a councillor next fall my 
way would be easy. This would 
be inevitable, because my grand- 
father and my father had built 
an empire and left it to me. With 
such an empire and my own good 
talent as a logician I could, as 
I lay there in the forest, decide 
that I wanted one day to be Old 
Man. 

The woman lay still in my 
arms. Her eyes had been fixed on 
the depths of trees where Red 
Giant cast Vermillion spears. 
Now they turned to me in a 
dream. I stroked her shoulder 
where coils of honey-colored hair 
buried my hand. The last gusts 
of the tide lifted lazy dervishes 
from the leaves about us and 
r^nled the flame of her cheeks. 

She said, “I have loved you 
since you came to me, like a god 
here in your forest.” 



182 



GALAXY 



I saw in her gentle mind that 
this was so, and also that she 
had hardly realized her capacity 
to love. 

Suddenly I remembered the 
name that Old Man had mutter- 
ed as he died. His elite wives 
had been gathered at his bed. 
His dearest friends had been 
there. But the last name he had 
uttered had been that cf a com- 
mon woman, a concubine who 
was not even allowed in the 
house. 

I marveled that he had taken 
this atelepathic woman to him- 
self and outraged elite people 
even before he became Old Man. 
And I saw that what this might 
have lost him in political support 
from elite women had been more 
than offset by his later populari- 
ty among the chupas. 

I focused again on the mind of 
this gentle, passionate woman 
beside me, and I found that her 
adoration was tempered by a 
strong determination of her own. 
The strength of her will astonish- 
ed me until she said in her mind, 
“He has hair like yours. It is 
red like the flame of Red Giant.” 
Then this woman’s mind open- 
ed to me. I was happy with un- 
derstanding. I kissed her face 
till she wept, and she said halt- 
ingly, “He is like Red Giant in 
another way. He takes a storm 
with him everywhere.” 

And suddenly, of all my child- 



ren, I loved best the wild littl/ 
chupa. 

V 

I t is wrong by the old stand- 
ards, but I lay beside the 
woman throughout the afternoon 
of the convention. She neither 
stirred nor spoke with her mouth 
in all that time. My awareness 
left the forest and centered en- 
tirely in the convention. 

I had returned barely in time. 
The voting had reached subjects 
critical to me. My turn for at- 
tention before the delegates came 
quickly. 

I began my speech gravely. 
“Mr. Chairman, ladies and 
gentlemen, and delegates. I am 
going to return to my plea for 
dishonesty in government.” 
There was a massive, telepath- 
ed groan from the ranks of radi- 
cal Mentalists and even some 
heavy sighs from conservatives. 
The radicals began hooting. It 
took the chair several seconds to 
quiet the disorder. 

Afterward I spoke dramatical- 
ly, directly to the chair. “Mr. 
Chairman, to protect this as- 
sembly against further outbursts 
of childishness, I am going to 
make an announcement. After 1 
have made it, I think you may 
wish to grant a 15-second recess 
to allow the delegates to confirm 
the announcement 



THE DELEGATE FROM GUAPANGA 



183 



“Mr. Chairman, ladies and 
gentlemen, and delegates. What 
I am going to ask as an integral 
part of our platform . what 
I am going to put into that plat- 
form concerning dishonesty in 
government . will in the ter- 
rible moment of “war” this after- 
noon . will in that crucial 
moment . 

I paused for a second while 
they sweated in anticipation of 
the moment that our logic would 
face the Matterist logic. 

“ . will in that decisive mo- 
ment, receive a solid vote of 
•yes’ from every . chupa ... on 
. this . planet.” 

It was a stunning moment. 
They were getting the thrill that 
had come to me when my half- 
brother had told me the news 
and it had crashed into my mind 
that chupas on the Matterist 
side could join chupas on our 
side to vote for us. 

In one moment our politics had 
been revolutionized. 

\ fter the recess which the 
Chairman eagerly called, I 
did not have to ask if chupa 
friends of the delegates had con- 
firmed me. The attention on me 
had deepened to the absolute. 
I had indeed rocked them, and 
for the first time they would hear 
me. 

“Mr. Chairman, ladies and 
gentlemen, and delegates. It re- 

184 



mains for me to state in a form 
suitable for our platform, the 
logic of our attitude tov/ard dis- 
honesty in government. 

“Politicians who want your 
money want, at worst, the least 
part of you. Even then they us- 
ually take only a little of the 
least part. They take what will 
not cause much excitement, so 
that the source will remain fruit- 
ful. Such men are almost never 
dangerous. 

“Give me the dishonest gov- 
ernment. I know where they 
stand. We need only structure 
our laws so that their activities 
have the dignity of commercial 
defense. Then these clever foxes, 
while fleecing us lightly, will de- 
fend our freedom and our prin- 
ciples like lions. In such a strong 
government we need only on oc- 
casional politician who is a fan- 
atic about ‘honesty’ to keep the 
rest in reasonable line.” 

I paused a few seconds and 
felt only profound attention fo- 
cused on me. I had begun nicely, 
a logic that would fit our plat- 
form. 

“No, it is among honest politi- 
cians that danger may lie! Show 
me the politician that has never 
gained money or made it possi- 
ble for his friends to do so, or 
h''s never partaken of the other 
licenses that power provide, and 
I will show you a fanatic. 

“The best that an honest poli- 



GALAXY 



IT 




i 



tician can be is a fanatic about 
honesty. But he can be much 
worse. It behooves you first to 
ask why he is honest. If he can 
answer that satisfactorily it be- 
hooves you to ask why he is in 
government. 

“How much of your freedom 
does the honest politician want 
in exchange for not taking your 
money? Does he want your right 
to vote? Your right to your land? 
Your right to your women, your 
right to drink spirits, or eat meat, 
or read books? 

“Such questions become critical 
when many honest men congre- 
gate in one government. Why 
have they foregathered in this 
ominous way? Why this unnatur- 
al climate of sobriety and thrift? 
What is it these honest men are 
seeking to change? The foxes 
have flown and your society is 
sick. 

“Let the next Old Man reduce 
the penalties against government- 
al dishonesty and embezzlement 
— just as I proposed at the last 
convention. Let the next Old 
man make our political position 
attractive to clever and intelli- 
gent men who happen to be a 
little dishonest. Only in this way 
can we have a government strong 
enough to resist honest fanatics 
and radical encroachment.” 

I paused again, and I found 
a surprised approval falling to- 
ward me ... a murmured phrase 



that was repeated over and over 
from all directions like a shower 
of autumn leaves. “Their money- 
economy. Their money-econo- 
my. 

T?or the first time this assembly 
^ had caught a glimpse of my 
political pragmatism and the di- 
mensions in which it could work 
for us. With the Matterists every- 
thing is organized . into man- 
agement teams, labor unions and 
clubs. They have only black- 
and-white language for their sup- 
posed virtues such as “industry”, 
“honesty” and “frugality”. Yet 
there is less virtue in their higher 
circles than in my meanest ten- 
ant. 

So now I shouted to the as- 
sembly. “Yes, their money-econ- 
omy! The Matterists have an 
almost complete money-economy 
in which dishonesty and embez- 
zlement are, at one and the 
same time, essentially prevalent 
and highly abhorred. 

“But what of our semi-feudal 
economy? Need we be fearful of 
political dishonesty where power 
and position are the right of 
birth? Will not the chupas be 
pleased that we lower the penal- 
ties on dishonesty to give them 
greater opportunity to succeed 
our world? 

“So, if we have logical reasons, 
as I have given them, to accept 
dishonesty as a fundamental in 



186 



GALAXY 



our political platform, what will 
happen to the Matterists when 
we face them in the moment of 
“war”? 

“In that moment when our 
minds are open to them, won’t 
their logic be confounded? For 
they cannot deny the prevalence 
of dishonesty. And they cannot 
deny that the most dangerous 
politicians are honest fanatics 
from whom we are protected by 
strong, dishonest governments. 
Yet acceptance of these things 
implies destruction of their econ- 
omy. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, we will 
win the “war” and lose nothing in 
the peace!” 

This conclusion was greeted 
with a storm of approval. 

My father - in - law focused 
tightly on me. “You will not 
have to wait till next fall. You 
will be voted to the Council of 
Pragmatists later in the after- 
noon. Why don’t you tactfully 
leave the convention now, at the 
height of your approval? You 
need not return until the voting 
starts.” 

VI 

I lay in quiet triumph beside 
the woman, and she knew I 
had returned. She did not say 
anything, but she thought about 
me unashamedly, and I knew her 
thoughts. 

THE DELEGATE FROM GUAPANGA 



She offered me a drink fronl 
the hasam gourd and I took it. 
Then I asked with my mind, 
“How far is it to your father’s 
house.” 

In her mind there was not an 
answer to my question. Rather, 
her mind filled with the reali- 
zation that I would buy her for 
a concubine. 

So I had to repeat my ques- 
tion, and still there was in her 
mind only this realization. 

Then I laughed and said loud- 
ly with my mouth, so that it 
startled her in the silent, after- 
noon forest, “How far is it to 
your father’s house?” 

Now I saw in her mind that 
the house would not be far be- 
yond the creek. A place with a 
well in the yard and an arbor 
for wesah. The little chupa would 
be teasing the hopani fowl in 
cackling flurries around the 
house. 

That was the way it was as 
we walked down from the forest 
except that the little chupa was 
not about. We crossed a field of 
freshly mown teree grass and 
walked up to the house. The 
woman straightened her hair 
self-consciously. I adjusted my 
tunic and my cap and found 
some leaves on my breeches. Red 
Giant hung in a cloudy blaze, 
waiting to start his plunge at 
the horizon. 

The father and his workmen 

187 



had finished in the fields for the 
day. They had just returned to 
the barns and the animals as the 
woman called him. 

He came out, a tall weathered 
man, straight and kindly faced. 
Yet I saw the face harden with 
resentment when he recognized 
me. This was a proud man who 
would never have asked me to 
right a wrong. 

Nevertheless, he bowed with 
respect. 

I spoke the proper idiom with 
warmth, for I respected the fath- 
er of such a woman. “I withdraw 
respectfully from the door to 
your mind.” 

Now, as was proper, he 
straightened from his bow. I saw 
that in the interim he had under- 
stood what this was about. He 
was happy for his daughter, and 
that the wrong would now be 
righted. 

Now the ceremony would have 
to come at once. In small talk 
tiiere might occur exchanges 
which are thought to be bad 
omens. So I declared, “Man, I 
would buy your daughter for a 
concubine.” 

The woman at once turned her 
twick to us and lowering her head, 
sighed. 

The father’s eyes were sudden- 
ly misted. Ceremonially, he look- 
ed up at the sky. “Red Giant 
witnesses what a fraud has come 
here.” 

188 



T T e went to the bam and called 
his three workmen out as 
witnesses to the “fraud”. He had 
had no wife for many years and 
so these would be the only wit- 
nesses. The workmen stood with 
their caps in their hands. Two of 
them who were married were 
smiling over the young woman’s 
fortune, but the unsmiling bach- 
elor had had a secret hope of 
his own. 

Doing my best to remember 
this ceremony, I took the tradi- 
tional coin of small worth from 
my purse and grasped the fath- 
er’s hand and placed the coin 
in it. I repeated, “I would buy 
your daughter, man.” 

The father cast the coin on 
the ground. I was grateful that 
he used the ancient, simpler form 
of the ceremony. He stamped on 
the coin and said, “I count not 
your money but your honor. 
Thus I see that you will mistreat 
her.” 

“I will treat her with respect.” 

“And then you will bring her 
unhappiness.” 

“I will bring her love and ten- 
derness.” 

“And finally, you will abandon 
her to wretchedness.” 

“I will keep her with me al- 
ways.” 

The father turned to his wit- 
nesses and demanded, “You hear 
this fraud?” 

And the workmen used the aii- 
GALAXY 



dent form, retorting in ragged 
unison, “No, we deem it honor- 
able.” 

The father then asked me, 
“You swear by Theda to do these 
things?” 

“I swear by Theda I will do 
all these things.” 

The ceremony was over, and 
the father and I clasped thumbs 
while the woman remained as 
she was with bowed head. 

He said, “I will take these wit- 
nesses to the village tomorrow 
and sign papers. They will be de- 
livered to you for signing, will 
they not?” 

“I think so. I have never done 
this.” 

He smiled and it was kind of 
him to say, “Though you think 
not. White Dwarf will reappear.” 
This common figure, referring to 
the regular eclipse and return of 
White Dwarf, meant it had been 
beyond human power that I was 
five years late in purchasing his 
daughter. 

I drew him aside at this point 
and this perturbed him. “No, 
Excellency, do not make a sug- 
gestion. There is no need for a 
purchase.” 

“I know there is no need, but 
I honor you and I insist.” 

“Please, no. I would not feel 
right.” 

I knew that he spoke the truth. 
I smiled and forced him to grasp 



thumbs again. “But you can do 
nothing if I sign to you whatever 
land you now cultivate.” 

With him this made a purchase 
possible because he need not 
physically accept something. It 
was an extravagant price that 
would outrage elite people. 

He saw that this measured my 
respect for his inability to accept 
the usual money. He shook his 
head and stared at the ground, 
unable to hide his smile of pride. 

The woman, w.io should have 
been standing in ceremonial si- 
lence some distance behind us, 
suddenly ran past callii'g, “Oh, 
my son, drop the thing. Throw it 
away. Father, you were supposed 
to look after him. Oh, my son, 
drop the thing.” 

It was the little chupa. He 
strode from the brush grimed and 
sweaty, holding in his hand a 
thin, lavender-striped nolegs as 
long as a man’s arm. The woman 
would not approach her son when 
she reached him because he glee- 
fully waved the coiling nolegs at 
her. 

Her father left me and took 
the nolegs from the child and let 
it glide away in the grass. Only 
then did she kneel and scold the 
chupa, while she brushed the 
dust from his tunic and the grime 
from his face and picked leaves 
and twigs from his red hair. 

He stared over her shoulder 
at me. Even when she used the 



THE DELEGATE FROM GUAPANGA 



18f 



hem of her gown to wipe the dirt 
from his face, pushing his face 
this way and that, he kept his 
wide eyes on me. I could feel his 
mind searching, and I opened my 
mind to him. 

The workman had laughed 
lightly about the nolegs. But 
when one of them saw the red- 
polled chupa being presented to 
me with my red hair falling from 
under my cap, he guffawed. The 
farmer ordered all three back to 
the barns. 

I lifted the child so that he sat 
on my arm and his mind seemed 
to be coming from his eyes. 
Presently he put his hands on me 
and he loved me. 

A fter a time the woman took 
him from me and he rested 
his head at her throat. She took 
her eyes from me and looked up 
at Red Giant. Then she said the 
simple thing that was true. 

“If all were chupa there would 
be no need for this “war”. 

What she said was even truer 
than she meant it. For, as I 
glanced with her at the sky, I 
saw the pale glow of our sister 
planet, Lalone, where the Mat- 
terists invaded and enslaved the 
semi-rationals during the reign 
of the last Matterist Old Man. If 
all were chupa we would not 
have to fight over and over 
against the Matterist ambitions. 

I turned to her father. “Have 



her pack only what she may 
need for tonight. I will send ser- 
vants tomorrow for whatever she 
wishes.” 

He started to agree but an ex- 
pression of intense concentration 
came over his face. I spun to the 
woman and found the same look 
on her face. 

One of my lieutenants was in- 
structing them to begin voting. 

I took just a monent to scan 
all of Guapanga, found the peo- 
ple voting hard against the Mat- 
terists’ “organized labor”, and 
the monks voting their subtle 
denials of Matterism, and the 
chupas voting like crazy for dis- 
honest government. It was a fine 
panorama for the dead-serious 
Matterists to have to face when 
they opened their minds to us. 

I promptly returned my aware- 
ness to the convention. I learned 
in an incidental flash that I had 
won my place on the Council, 
and I found the delegates in a 
hasty vote for our candidate for 
Old Man. 

My father-in-law won, as had 
been foregone, and only just in 
time. The Matterists were al- 
ready probing for our collective 
awareness. It was the moment 
of “war”. 

This probing of foreign logic 
acts as a catalyst. All elite Men- 
talists, including now even the 
women of Guapanga, opened 
tbeir minds to the logic of our 



190 



GALAXY 



platform. Collectively and in- 
tensely we believed our platform 
in all its logical beauty; an al- 
gebra of faith, cemented at every 
possible point to reality. Every 
Mentalist on the planet partook 
of one mind and one logic. 

/^nly three times in my life 
have I been part of this al- 
most unendurable moment of to- 
tal, social awareness. It is like a 
moment of being a god. 

Our logic neatly encompassed 
and projected, on my pragmatic 
basis, the massive, uniform vote 
of the common people and the 
telepathing of the chupas. We 
saw, even as the collective mind 
of the Matterists became discern- 
able, how impossible it would be 
for their logic to digest or deny 
these comically true assertions 
about life with which we could 
live so easily. 

Now the two collective minds 
were completely interpentrated 
Age-old confusions were stirred 
in us by the Matterist’s foreign 
logic. But we were stirring more 
than confusion in them. In only 
a few minutes they were in de- 
feat, their collective logic frag- 
mented by our stronger logic. 
Abruptly, they were asking indi- 
vidually for tlie placing of Old 
Man to begin. 

While we still held our collec- 
tive mind in order that the plac- 
ing of Old Man could get safe- 



ly under way, it was fascinating 
to listen to snatches of conversa- 
tion back and forth between in- 
dividual Matterists. They were 
contacting friends and family 
members now that their collec- 
tive mind had been broken, and 
they spoke not as a stationary 
god, the way we continued to 
speak, but as mystified people. 

“What in the name of Paline 
was that business about dis- 
honest government being the best 
government?” 

Then a woman to her promi- 
nent husband, “I tell you, you 
have to do something. H6w hor- 
rible to be ruled by an Executive 
with three wives and a raft of 
messy concubines!” 

Then one industrialist to an- 
other: “There they were again 
with all their people voting 
against work. If our workers get 
that way we’re doomed.” 

A young schoolman cursed 
angrily. “How can they go on 
disbelieving in progress and beat 
us every time?” 

And still we millions of Men- 
talists held our collective mind, 
our god-like awareness of each 
other and the total, victorious 
platform of belief and logic we 
had put together that day. While 
we held this collective mind, our 
new Old Man, my father-in-law, 
made his delicate, pragmatic way 
into the Matterists’ shattered 
faiths. 



THE DELEGATE FROM GUAPANGA 



191 



This process of becoming Old 
Man requires a consummate logi- 
cian and the ardent assistance, 
throughout the truce, of his form- 
er enemies as well as his friends. 
Frequently, the first pretender to 
this position has had more ambi- 
tion than talent for pragmatic 
logic and has gone out of his 
mind. 

But my father-in-law would 
make it. 

There was no doubt about the 
old lecher’s ability. He would 
make a fine Old Man . and 
one who would not live too long 
for my ambitions. 

VII 

■y^hen at last we Mentalists 
were released from the col- 
lective mind by an order from 
the new Old Man, I found my- 
self in the farmer’s yard. Of 
course I had fallen to the ground 
during the great concentration. 

The woman was kneeling near 
me without touching me. She 
explained, “Father has fed the 
boy and is putting him to bed.” 

Red Giant boiled on the crest 
of the black Guapangas and 
darkness streaked across the foot- 
hills. The larger moon, the elec- 
tric blue Theda, Goddess of 
Love, had risen behind us. 

So I said, “Our way home will 
be lighted by Theda and warm- 
ed by Red Giant” 



My elite women consider me 
crude, and I saw that this wom- 
an and I would get along fine. 
For, in the common language, 
my remark had a double mean- 
ing and her quiet laugh had a 
hoydenish ring. 

But we did not leave in time 
to be warmed by Red Giant. 
The father came out and an- 
nounced, “You have had a vic- 
tory.” 

I corroborated that and he 
added, “Then we have two things 
to drink to.” 

We went into the kitchen and 
he poured liberal glasses of cool 
wesah wine. We drank them 
slowly sitting before a wood fire 
and talking about how the father 
should have another wife. Then 
he poured us another glass, ex- 
cept for the woman who said she 
would have no more. So her 
father and I had two more. 

After that I said, “No, thank 
you. I am sufficiently drunk to 
withstand a walk through the 
woods.” 

I carried the sleeping child and 
tile woman carried her bundle. 
Sometimes we touched each oth- 
er, but it was a little late for 
woodland love — especially since 
I was burdened with the past of- 
fense that slept on my shoulder. 

"IT^hen we reached the lodge 
^ ^ we found servants out in 
the entrance with lanterns.

My chupa half-brother stated, 
“Excellency, you have kept a 
closed mind and we have been 
worried about you.’- 

“Thank you. I have been well.” 
He stared at the honey-haired 
woman. The thought that crossed 
his mind was immediately pick- 
ed up inside the lodge, and I 
felt the minds of all three elite 
wives tense. Well, they would 
stay tense all night, I could tell 
them. 

I was weary of my role as 
strong father. I said to my half- 
brotlier, “Here, please carry this 
dumpling.” 

To a servant I said, “And you 
please take the woman’s bundle.” 
Now, my half-brother was star- 
ing at the child’s red poll, and 
he laughed aloud with his mouth. 
At that there was a flurry of 
telepathic gabbling from within 
the lodge. They left the bathing 
of the children and the roasting 
of a flank of the charl boar, and 
the overseeing of the setting of 
the table for dining, and they 
were coming to meet us. 

I put my arm about the wom- 
an’s shoulder. We walked into 
the great lodge with its hundred 
rooms and many courts to meet 
my elite women. I felt her trem- 
ble and I pressed her shoulder 
to me reassuringly. 

My eldest son came running 
pellmell and stopped before us. 
He stared in stunned silence at 



the honey-haired woman. She 
smiled at him and he smiled with 
widening eyes. Then he dashed 
forward and threw himself in my 
arms. 

“Father, I’m so glad you’re 
back.” 

I held the youth with one arm 
and stroked his dark head. “I’m 
glad to be back, son.” 

“Father, you know we have 
had big gray karks in the grain 
bins.” 

“Yes, they have been eating 
and spoiling too much grain.” 

“I killed three of them today 
with a club.” 

I looked him in the eye steadi- 
ly. Then I removed my arm from 
the woman and took his head 
in my hands and kissed his 
cheek. “Thank you, son. That 
had to be done.” 

I pushed him away playfully. 
“Get along now. We have to 
meet your mother.” 

A t the entrance to the central 
court my three elite wives 
stopped and stared at us. We 
stopped and the servants stopped. 

With my mouth I announced 
to my elite wives, “I have 
brought home a concubine,” and 
realized with embarrassment that 
I had made it sound like I had 
brought home some grand pre- 
sent for them. 

Graciously, my chief wife said 
with her moutih, “Isn't Ae love-

!y.” And she extended her hands 
and came forward to greet the 
woman. 

To me she telepathed, “I had 
rather you came home with a 
stick, My Husband.” 

My father was suddenly in my 
mind, irritable and resentful. “I 
want to see her. I want to see 
the honey-haired woman and her 
red-haired child. I want to see 
the big club you have brought 
home.” 

“Forgive me, father. Please! 
Tomorrow. This is so short a 
night.” 

Ilis mouth chuckled. “Tomor- 
row, son. This has been a fine 
convention all around.” 

''T^his day had made it clear to 
me that the old worlds of 
the elite were very nearly over. 
As a politician first and an arch- 
conservative later, I had reached 
a radical conclusion. This admir- 
able child with the red poll was 
the future. 

As Old Man, I would help that 
chupa’s future along by changing 
a few marriage laws. In that fu- 



ture, all will be diupa. That will 
end the Matterist plans to colon- 
ize yellow suns. 

I stroked the child’s red head 
and knew his dreaming mind. He 
was fascinated with the booming 
flight of the rockets. As surely 
as he lay there he would build 
more engines and fly into space. 

Very well. He can go to that 
distant yellow sim and tell those 
semi-rationals on Erth how they 
have been saved by the conser- 
vative party of Guapanga. When 
he is old enough, I will be Old 
Man, and I will arrange the trip. 
It will give those Erth people 
something to think about besides 
that mechanical telepathing by 
Eid Sulvan and Joni Karson. How 
that stuff can jam the galaxy. 

I envy him, the little chupa. 
There on Erth, they have a blue 
jay. It is one thing to telepath 
from the mind of a semi-rational 
who is there. It would be quite 
another thing to see, with your 
own eyes, one of those blue jays 
flash in the trees of Erth like a 
splinter struck from that blue 
sky.— WYMAN GUIN
