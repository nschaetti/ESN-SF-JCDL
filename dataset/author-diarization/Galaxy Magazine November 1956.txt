THE BROADCAST 
BAND WRIST RADIO 
was developed by a re* 
search organization 
having wide experience 
in the design and man* 
ufacture of electronic 
equipment for guided 
nusslle use. These tech- 
niques have been ap> 
plied to the develop- 
ment of a miniature 
radio receiver. A special 
(patent pending) regeu- 
erative RF reflex circuit 
is incorporated in the 
wrist radio which al- 
lows for good selectiv- 
ity and maximum sen- 
sitivity. In moderate 
signal strength areas, 
no antenna is required. 
The high sensitivity of 
the receiver permits its 
use with no external antenna at distances 
up to twenty-five miles for a broadcast 
station of average power, facilitating its 
use as a true wrist radio. Good reception 
is possible at greater distances bv the use 
of a short length of wire from six inches 
to three feet dep^ding on the distance 
from the broadcast station. Consistent 
reception has been obtained over thirty- 
five miles from the transmitter site. 

The small size mak^ it the ideal radio. 
It can be worn on the wrist where it wilt 
fit comfortably under the sleeve of a 
Jacket or worn in a shirt pocket. 

The use of transUtwe mtkei It s ragged deelee 
not subjected to tube breekege. Spectei ragged- 
laed hlgb-quelUjr components ere used throughout. 
Normelly the trensistor will not here to be replaced 
for the life of the Instrament. BKtremo ecomwiy of 
operetion is obteined through the use of tpeeial cir- 
cuitry requiring very low current, thus proloaging 
the life of the mercury cells. Battery life is approxi- 
mately one hundred hours and battery cost of opera- 
tion is less than two cenu per hour.

A s WE get closer to space 
travel, people who worry 
about that sort of thing are trying 
to devise ways of keeping the 
crews sane. One way to keep sane, 
of course, is to get away from peo- 
ple who worry about that sort of 
thing. 

The proposals, like proverbs, 
all make sense and yet all contra- 
dict one another; Lone pilots be- 
cause more would get on each 
other’s nerves. Several because 
lone pilots get on their own nerves. 
Mixed crews to avoid frustration. 
All-male (sometimes all-female) 
crews to avoid bloodshed. 

I don’t think it matters much — 
provided every member of the 
Crew has a monkey to attend to. 
If scientific reasons are needed, 
they can be thought up as fast as 
the crew catches wise: to test air, 
temperature, metabolism, food, 
psychic climate, hard radiation, 
and so forth. 

Naturally, the only motive that 
matters is to saddle the crew with 
a monkey apiece. 

I derive this solution from my 
own experience in the Pacific dur- 
ing WW II, when I thought hav- 
ing a monkey would take my 
mind off things. It did. I was as 
tied down as a mother of nine.

Baggy (for Baguio, where he 
was captured) fought furiously 
against being housCbroken, left 
alone or allowed to be hungry. I 
almost went broke feeding him, 
finally outflanked regulations by 
cutting bananas off a tree in a 
mined area. That saved pesos. 
But then Baggy got so sick that 
he couldn’t even work up a decent 
glare. 

I knew then that he was close 
to death. 

But good old Pedro, our native 
scout, spotted the stalk of ba- 
nanas I’d liberated and said of 
course Baggy was sick — I’d been 
feeding him male bananas. 

That’s the real point here; the 
sequel may be of interest, but it’s 
not important: Baggy recovered, 
glare and all, and I sold him to a 
sailor minutes after checking into 
a rest camp in Manila, and knew 
(relative) freedom again. I tried 
often to find the difference be- 
tween male and female bananas, 
never succeeded, which good old 
Pedro claimed was a matter of 
Filipino know-how. 

Not long ago, I mentioned my 
puzzlement to Willy Ley. He 
choked on his cigar and kept 
choking while he gave me the

The Man Who Ate the World 

In a civilization which flowed with milk and honey 
— and flowed and flowed and flowed — his 
tragedy was that he had not drowned at birth!

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





By FREDERIK POHL 
Illustrated by DOCKTOR 



H e had a name but at 
home he was called 
“Sonny,” and he was al- 
most always at home. He hated 
it. Other boys his age went to 
school. Sonny would have done 
anything to go to school, but his 
family was, to put it mildly, not 
well off. It was not Sonny’s fault 
that his father was so unsuccess- 
ful. But it meant no school for 
Sonny, no boys of his own age 
for Sonny to play with. All child- 
hoods are tragic (as all adults 
forget), but Sonny’s was misery 
all the way through. 

The worst time was at night, 
when the baby sister was asleep 
and the parents were grimly eat- 
ing and reading and dancing and 
drinking, until they were ready to 
drop. And of all bad nights, the 
night before his twelfth birthday 
was perhaps Sonny’s worst. He 
was old enough to know what a 
birthday party was like. 

It would be cake and candy, 
shows and games. 

It would be presents, presents, 
presents. 

It would be a terrible, endless 
day. 

He switched off the color-D 
television and the recorded tapes 
of sea chanteys and, with an ap- 
pearance of absent-mindedness, 
walked toward the door of his 
playroom. 

Davey Crockett got up from 
beside the model rocket field and 




I 

said, “Hold on thar, Sonny. 
Mought take a stroll with you.” 
Davey, with a face as serene and 
strong as a Tennessee crag, 
swung its long huntin’ rifle under 
one arm and put its other arm 
around Sonny’s shoulders. “Where 
you reckon the two of us ought 
to head?” 

Sonny shook Davey Crockett’s 
arm off. “Get lost,” he said petu- 
lantly. “Who wants you around?” 

T ONG JOHN SILVER came 
out of the closet, hobbling 
on its wooden leg, crouched over 
its knobby cane. “Ah, young mas- 
ter,” it said reproachfully, “you 
shouldn’t ought to talk to old 
Davey like that! He’s a good 
friend to you, Davey is. Many’s 
the weary day Davey and me has 
been a-keepin’ of your company. 
I asks you this, young master: Is 
it fair and square that you should 
be a-tellin’ him to get lost? Is it 
fair, young master? Is it square?” 

Sonny looked at the floor stub- 
bornly and didn’t answer. What 
was the use of answering dum- 
mies like them? He stood rebel- 
liously silent and still until he 
just felt like saying something. 
And then he said: “You go in the 
closet, both of you. I don’t want 
to play with you. I’m going to 
play with my trains.” 

Long John said unctuously: 
“Now there’s a good idea, that is! 
You just be a-havin’ of a good 

8 



time with your trains and old 
Davey and me’ll— ” 

“Go ahead!” shouted Sonny. He 
kept stamping his foot until they 
were out of sight. 

His fire truck was in the mid- 
dle of the floor; he kicked at it, 
but it rolled quickly out of reach 
and slid into its little garage un- 
der the tanks of tropical fish. 

He scuffed over to the model 
railroad layout and glared at it. 
As he approached, the Twentieth 
Century Limited came roaring 
out of a tunnel, sparks flying 
from its stack. It crossed a bridge, 
whistled at a grade crossing, 
steamed into the Union Station. 
The roof of the station glowed 
and suddenly became transpar- 
ent, and through it Sonny saw 
the bustling crowds of redcaps 
and travelers — 

“I don’t want that,” he said. 
“Casey, crack up old Number 
Ninety-nine again.” 

Obediently the layout quiv- 
ered and revolved a half-turn. 
Old Casey Jones, one and an 
eighth inches tall, leaned out of 
the cab of the S.P. locomotive 
and waved good-by to Sonny. 
The locomotive whistled shrilly 
twice and picked up speed — 

It was a good crackup. Little 
old Casey’s body, thrown com- 
pletely free, developed real blis- 
ters from the steam and bled real 
blood. But Sonny turned his back 
on it. He had liked that crackup 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




for a long time — longer than he 
liked almost any other toy he 
owned. But he was tired of it. 

He looked around the room. 

Tarzan of the Apes, leaning 
against a foot-thick tree trunk, 
one hand on a vine, lifted its 
head and looked at him; but Tar- 
zan was clear across the room. 
The others were in the closet. 

Sonny ran out and slammed 
the door. He saw Tarzan start to 
come after him, but even before 
Sonny was out of the room, Tar- 
zan slumped and stood stock- 
still. 

T T wasn’t fair. Sonny thought 
angrily. They wouldn’t even 
chase him, so that at least he 
could have some kind of chance 
to get away by himself. They’d 
iust talk to each other on their 
little radios, and in a minute one 
of the tutors, or one of the maids, 
or whatever else happened to be 
handy would vector in on him — 

But, for the moment, he was 
free. 

He slowed down and walked 
along the Great Hall toward his 
baby sister’s room. The fountains 
began to splash as he entered the 
hall; the mosaics on the wall be- 
gan to tinkle music and sparkle 
with moving colors. 

“Now, chile, whut you up to?” 

He turned around, but he knew 
it was Mammy coming toward 
him. It was slapping toward him 



on big, flat feet, its pink-palmed 
hands lifted to its shoulders. The 
face under the red bandanna was 
frowning, its gold tooth sparkling 
as Mammy scolded: “Chile, you 
is got usns so worried, we’s fit to 
die! How you ’speck us to take 
good keer of you efn you run off 
lak that? Now you jes come on 
back to your nice room with 
Mammy an’ we’ll see if there 
ain’t some real nice program on 
the TV.” 

Sonny stopped and waited for 
it, but he wouldn’t give it the sat- 
isfaction of looking at it. Slap- 
slap the big feet waddled cum- 
bersomely toward him; but he 
didn’t have any illusions. Wad- 
dle, big feet, three hundred 
pounds and all. Mammy could 
catch him in twenty yards with a 
ten-yard start. Any of them 
could. 

He said in his best icily indig- 
nant voice: “I was just going in 
to look at my baby sister.” 
Pause. “You was?” The plump 
black face looked suspicious. 

“Yes, I was. Doris is my own 
sister and I love her.” 

Pause— long pause. “Dat’s nice,” 
said Mammy, but its voice was 
still doubtful. “I ’speck I better 
come ’long with you. You 
wouldn’t want to wake your lil 
baby sister up. Ef I come. I’ll he’p 
you keep real quiet.” 

Sonny shook free of it — they 
were always putting their hands

on kids! “I don’t want you to 
come with me, Mammy!” 

“Aw, now, honey! Mammy ain’t 
gwine bother nothin’, you knows 
that!” 

Sonny turned his back on it 
and marched grimly toward his 
sister’s room. If only they would 
leave him alone! But they never 
did. 

It was always that way, always 
one darn old robot — yes, robot, 
he thought, savagely tasting the 
naughty word. Always one darn 
robot after another. Why couldn’t 
Daddy be like other daddies, so 
they could live in a decent little 
house and get rid of those darn 
robots — so he could go to a real 
school and be in a class with 
other boys, instead of being 
taught at home by Miss Brooks 
and Mr. Chips and all those other 
robots? 

They spoiled everything. And 
they would spoil what he wanted 
to do now. But he was going to 
do it all the same, because there 
was something in Doris’s room 
that he wanted very much. 

It was probably the only tan- 
gible thing he wanted in the 
world. 

A S HE and Mammy passed 
the imitation tumbled rocks 
of the Bear Cave, Mama Bear 
poked its head out and growled: 
“Hello, Sonny. Don’t you think 
you ought to be in bed? It’s nice 



and warm in our bear bed. 
Sonny.” 

He didn’t even look at it. Time 
was when he had liked that sort 
of thing, too, but he wasn’t a four- 
year-old like Doris any more. All 
the same, there was one thing a 
four-year-old had — 

He stopped at the door of her 
room. “Doris?” he whispered. 

Mammy scolded: “Now, chile, 
you knows that lil baby is asleep! 
How come you tryin’ to wake her 
up?” 

‘T won’t wake her up.” The 
furthest thing from Sonny’s mind 
was to wake his sister up. He tip- 
toed into the room and stood be- 
side the little girl’s bed. Lucky 
kid! he thought enviously. Being 
four, she was allowed to have a 
tiny little room and a tiny bed — 
while Sonny had to wallow 
around in a forty-foot bedcham- 
ber and a bed eight feet long. 

He looked down at his sister. 
Behind him, Mammy clucked ap- 
provingly. “Dat’s nice when chil- 
luns loves each other lak you an’ 
that lil baby,” it whispered. 

Doris was sound asleep, clutch- 
ing her teddy-bear. It wriggled 
slightly and opened an eye to 
look at Sonny, but it didn’t say 
anything. 

Sonny took a deep breath, 
leaned forward and gently slipped 
the teddy-bear out of the bed. 

It scrambled pathetically, try- 
ing to get free. 



10 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Mammy whispered urgently: 
“Sonny! Now you let dat old 
teddy-bear alone, you heah me?” 
Sonny whispered: “I’m not 

hurting anything. Leave me 
alone, will you?” 

“Sonny!” 

He clutched the little furry 
robot desperately around its 
middle. The stubby arms pawed 
at him, the furred feet scratched 
against his arms. It growled a tiny 
doll-bear growl, and whined, and 
suddenly his hands were wet with 
its real salt tears. 

“Sonny! Come on now, honey, 
you knows that’s Doris’s Teddy. 
Aw, chile!” 

He said: “It’s mine!” It wasn’t 
his. He knew it wasn’t. His was 
long gone, taken away from him 
when he was six because it was 
old, and because he had been six, 
and six-year-olds had to have big- 
ger, more elaborate companion- 
robots. It wasn’t even the same 
color as his — it was brown and 
his had been black and white. 
But it was cuddly and gently 
warm and he had heard it whis- 
pering little bedtime stories to 
Doris. And he wanted it very 
much. 

■pOOTSTEPS in the hall out- 
side. A low-pitched pleading 
voice from the door: “Sonny, you 
must not interfere with your sis- 
ter’s toySi One has obligations.” 
He stood forlornly, holding the 



teddy-bear. “Go away, Mr. 
Chips!” 

“Really, Sormy! This isn’t 
proper behavior. Please return the 
toy.” 

“I won’t!” 

Mammy, dark face pleading in 
the shadowed room, leaned to- 
ward him and tried to take it 
away from him. “Aw, honey, now 
you know that’s not—” 

“Leave me alone!” he shouted. 
There was a gasp and a little 
whimper from the bed, and Doris 
sat up and began to cry. 

The little girl’s bedroom was 
suddenly filled with robots — and 
not only robots, for in a moment 
the butler appeared, leading 
Sonny’s actual flesh-and-blood 
mother and father. 

Sonny made a terrible scene. 
He cried, and he swore at them 
childishly for being the unsuc- 
cessful clods they were, and they 
nearly wept, too, because they 
were aware that their lack of 
standing was bad for the chil- 
dren. But he couldn’t keep Teddy. 

They marched him back to his 
room, where his father lectured 
him while his mother stayed be- 
hind to watch Mammy comfort 
the little girl. 

His father said: “Sonny, you’re 
a big boy now. We aren’t as well 
off as other people, but you have 
to help us. Don’t you know that, 
Sonny? We all have to do our 
part. Your mother and I’ll be up

till midnight now, consuming, be- 
cause you’ve made this scene. 
Can’t you at least try to consume 
something bigger than a teddy- 
bear? It’s all right for Doris be- 
cause she’s so little, but a big 
boy like you—” 

“I hate you!” cried Sonny, and 
he turned his face to the wall. 

They punished him, naturally. 
The first pimishment was that 
they give him an extra birthday 
party the week following. 

The second punishment was 
even worse. 

II 

T ATER — much, much later, 
^ nearly a score of years — a 
man named Roger Garrick in a 
place named Fisherman’s Island 
walked into his hotel room. 

The light didn’t go on. 

The bellhop apologized, “We’re 
sorry, sir. We’ll have it attended 
to, if possible.” 

“If possible?” Garrick’s eye- 
brows went up. The bellhop made 
putting in a new light tube sound 
like a major industrial operation. 
“All right.” He waved the bellhop 
out of the room. It bowed and 
closed the door. 

Garrick looked around him, 
frowning. One light tube more or 
less didn’t make a lot of differ- 
ence; there was still the light from 
the sconces at the walls, from the 
reading lamps at the chairs and 



chaise-longue and from the pho- 
tomural on the long side of the 
room — to say nothing of the fact 
that it was broad, hot daylight 
outside and light poured through 
the windows. All the same, it was 
a new sensation to be in a room 
where the central lighting wasn’t 
on. He didn’t like it. It was — 
creepy. 

A rap on the door. A girl was 
standing there, young, attractive, 
rather small. But a woman grown, 
it was apparent. “Mr. Garrick? 
Mr. Roosenburg is expecting you 
on the sun deck.” 

“All right.” He rummaged 
around in the pile of luggage, 
looking for his briefcase. It wasn’t 
even sorted out! The bellhop had 
merely dumped the stuff and 
left. 

The girl said: “Is that what 
you’re looking for?” He looked 
where she was pointing; it was 
his briefcase, behind another bag. 
“You’ll get used to that aroimd 
here. Nothing in the right place, 
nothing working right. We’ve all 
gotten used to it.” 

We. He looked at her sharply, 
but she was no robot; there was 
life, not the glow of electronic 
tubes, in her eyes. “Pretty bad, 
is it?” 

She shrugged. “Let’s go see 
Mr. Roosenburg. I’m Kathryn 
Pender, by the way. I’m his stat- 
istician.” 

He followed her out into the

hall. “Statistician, did you say?” 
She turned and smiled — a 
tight, grim smile of annoyance. 
“That’s right. Surprised?” 

Garrick said uneasily: “Well, 
it’s more a robot job. Of course, 
I’m not familiar with the practice 
in this sector — ” 

“You will be,” she promised 
bluntly. “No, we aren’t taking the 
elevator. Mr. Roosenburg’s in a 
hurry to see you.” 

“But 

She actually glared at him. 
“Don’t you understand? Day be- 
fore yesterday, I took the eleva- 
tor and I was hung up between 
floors for an hour and a half. 
Something was going on at North 
Guardian and it took all the 
power in the lines. Would it hap- 
pen again today? I don’t know. 
But, believe me, an hour and a 
half is a long time to be stuck 
in an elevator.” 

She turned and led him to the 
fire stairs. Over her shoulder, she 
said: “Get it straight once and 
for all, Mr. Garrick. You’re in a 
disaster area here . Anyway, 
it’s only ten more flights.” 

^ I ■’EN flights. Nobody climbed 
ten flights of stairs any more! 
Garrick was huffing and puffing 
before they were half way, but 
the girl kept on ahead, light as a 
gazelle. Her skirt reached be- 
tween hip and knees, and Garrick 
had plenty of opportunity to ob- 



serve that her legs were attrac- 
tively tanned. Even so, he 
couldn’t help looking around him. 

It was a robot’s-eye view of 
the hotel that he was getting; this 
was the bare wire armature that 
held up the confectionery suites 
and halls where the humans went. 
Garrick knew, as everyone ab- 
sently knew, that there were 
places like this behind the scenes 
everywhere. Belowstairs, the ro- 
bots worked; behind scenes, they 
moved about their errands and 
did their jobs. But nobody went 
there. 

It was funny about the backs 
of this girl’s knees. They were 
paler than the rest of the leg — 

Garrick wrenched his mind 
back to his surroundings. Take 
the guard rail along the steps, for 
instance. It was wire-thin, frail- 
looking. No doubt it could bear 
any weight it was required to, 
but why couldn’t it look that 
strong? 

The answer, obviously, was that 
robots did not have humanity’s 
built-in concepts of how strong a 
rail should look before they could 
believe it really was strong. If a 
robot should be in any doubt — 
and how improbable that a robot 
should be in doubt! — it would 
perhaps reach out a sculptured 
hand and test it. Once. And then 
it would remember, and never 
doubt again, and it wouldn’t be 
continually edging toward the

wall, away from the spider-strand 
between it and the vertical drop— 
He conscientiously took the 
middle of the steps all the rest 
of the way up. 

Of course, that merely meant a 
different distraction, when he 
really wanted to do some think- 
ing. But it was a pleasurable dis- 
traction. And by the time they 
reached the top, he had solved 
the problem. The pale spots at 
the back of Miss Pender’s knees 
meant she had got her tan the 
hard way — walking in the Sun, 
perhaps working in the Sun, so 
that the bending knees kept the 
Sun from the patches at the back; 
not, as anyone else would acquire 
a tan, by lying beneath a normal, 
healthful sunlamp held by a ro- 
bot masseur. 

He wheezed: “You don’t mean 
we’re all the way up!” 

“All the way up,” she said, and 
looked at him closely. “Here, lean 
on me if you want to.” 

“No, thanks!” He staggered 
over to the door, which opened 
naturally enough as he ap- 
proached it, and stepped out into 
the flood of sunlight on the roof, 
to meet Mr. Roosenburg. 

ARRICK wasn’t a medical 
doctor, but he remembered 
enough of his basic pre-speciali- 
zation to know there was some- 
thing in that fizzy golden drink. 
It tasted perfectly splendid — just 



cold enough, just fizzy enough, 
not quite too sweet. And after 
two sips of it, he was buoyant 
with strength and well-being. 

He put the glass down and 
said: “Thank you for whatever 
it was. Now let’s talk.” 

“Gladly, gladly!” boomed Mr. 
Roosenburg. “Kathryn, the files!” 

Garrick looked after her, shak- 
ing his head. Not only was she a 
statistician, which was robot 
work, she was also a file clerk — 
and that was barely robot work. 
It was the kind of thing handled 
by a semi-sentient punchcard 
sorter in a decently run sector. 

Roosenburg said sharply: 
“Shocks you, doesn’t it? But 
that’s why you’re here.” He was 
a slim, fair little man and he 
wore a golden beard cropped 
square. 

Garrick took another sip of the 
fizzy drink. It was good stuff; it 
didn’t intoxicate, but it cheered. 
He said: “I’m glad to know why 
I’m here.” 

The golden beard quivered. 
“Area Control sent you down and 
didn’t tell you this was a disaster 
area?” 

Garrick put down the glass. 
“I’m a psychist. Area Control 
said you needed a psychist. From 
what I’ve seen, it’s a supply prob- 
lem, but—” 

“Here are the files,” said Kath- 
ryn Pender, and stood watching 
him. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

Roosenburg took the spools of 
tape from her and dropped them 
in his lap. He asked tangentially: 
“How old are you, Roger?” 
Garrick was annoyed. “I’m a 
qualified psychist! I happen to be 
assigned to Area Control and—” 
“How old are you?” 

Garrick scowled. “Twenty- 
four.” 

Roosenburg nodded. “Um. 
Rather young,” he observed. 
“Maybe you don’t remember how 
things used to be.” 

Garrick said dangerously: “All 
the information I need is on that 
tape. I don’t need any lectures 
from you.” 

Roosenburg pursed his lips and 
got up. “Come here a minute, will 
you?” 

TXE moved over to the rail 
** of the sim deck and pointed. 
“See those things down there?” 
Garrick looked. Twenty stories 
down, the village straggled off to- 
ward the sea in a tangle of pastel 
oblongs and towers. Over the bay, 
the hills of the mainland were 
faintly visible through mist and, 
riding the bay, the flat white 
floats of the solar receptors. 

“It’s a power plant. That what 
you mean?” 

Roosenburg boomed: “A power 
plant. All the power the world 
can ever use, out of this one and 
all the others, all over the world.” 
He peered out at the bobbing 



floats, soaking up energy from 
the Sun. “And people used to try 
to wreck them,” he added. 

Garrick said stiffly: “I may 
only be twenty-four years old, 
Mr. Roosenburg, but I have com- 
pleted school.” 

“Oh, yes. Of course you have, 
Roger. But maybe schooling isn’t 
the same thing as living through 
a time like that. I grew up in the 
Era of Plenty, when the law was 
Consume! My parents were poor 
and I still remember the misery 
of my childhood. Eat and con- 
sume, wear and use. I never had 
a moment’s peace, Roger! For 
the very poor, it was a treadmill; 
we had to consume so much that 
we could never catch up, and the 
further we fell behind, the more 
the Ration Board forced on us — ” 

“That’s ancient history, Mr. 
Roosenburg. Morey Fry liberated 
us from all that.” 

The girl said softly: “Not all 
of us.” 

The man with the golden beard 
nodded. “Not all of us — as you 
should know, Roger, being a psy- 
chist.” 

Garrick sat up straight and 
Roosenburg went on: “Fry showed 
us that the robots could help at 
both ends — by producing and by 
consuming. But it came a little 
late for some of us. The patterns 
of childhood do linger on.” 

Kathryn Pender leaned toward 
Garrick. “What he’s trying to say. 



THE MAN WHO ATE THE WORLD

Mr. Garrick, is that we’ve got a 
compulsive consumer on our 
hands.” 

Ill 

ORTH GUARDIAN IS- 
LAND — nine miles away. It 
wasn’t as much as a mile wide 
and not much more than that in 
length,, but it had its city and its 
bathing beaches, its parks and 
theaters. It was possibly the most 
densely populated island in the 
world . for the number of its 
inhabitants. 

The President of the Council 
convened their afternoon meeting 
in a large and lavish room. There 
were nineteen councilmen around 
a lustrous mahogany table. Over 
the President’s shoulder, the 
others could see the situation 
map of North Guardian and the 
areas surrounding. North Guar- 
dian glowed blue, cold, impreg- 
nable. The sea was misty green; 
the mainland, Fisherman’s Is- 
land, South Guardian and the rest 
of the little archipelago were hot, 
hostile red. 

Little flickering fingers of red 
attacked the blue. Flick, and a 
ruddy flame wiped out a corner 
of a beach. Flick, and a red spark 
appeared in the middle of the 
city, to grow and blossom, and 
then to die. Each little red whip- 
flick was a point where, momen- 
tarily, the defenses of the island 

16 



were down; but always and al- 
ways, the cool blue brightened 
around the red and drowned it. 

The President was tall, stooped, 
old. It wore glasses, though robot 
eyes saw well enough without. It 
said, in a voice that throbbed 
with power and pride: “The first 
item of the order of business will 
be a report of the Defense Sec- 
retary.” 

The Defense Secretary rose to 
its feet, hooked a thumb in its 
vest and cleared its throat. “Mr. 
President — ” 

“Excuse me, sir.” A whisper 
from the sweet-faced young 
blonde taking down the minutes 
of the meeting. “Mr. Trumie has 
just left Bowling Green, heading 
north.” 

The whole council turned to 
glance at the situation map, 
where Bowling Green had just 
flared red. 

The President nodded stiffly, 
like the crown of an old redwood 
nodding. “You may proceed, Mr. 
Secretary,” it said after a mo- 
ment. 

“Our invasion fleet,” began the 
Secretary, in its high, clear voice, 
“is ready for sailing on the first 
suitable tide. Certain units have 
been, ah, inactivated, at the, ah, 
instigation of Mr. Trumie. But on 
the whole, repairs have been com- 
pleted and the units will be serv- 
iceable within the next few 
hours.” Its lean, attractive face 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





turned solemn. “I am afraid, how- 
ever, that the Air Command has 
sustained certain, ah, increments 
of attrition — due, I should em- 
phasize, to chances involved in 
certain calculated risks—” 

“Question! Question!” It was 
the Commissioner of Public 
Safety, small, dark, fire-eyed, 
angry. 

“Mr. Commissioner?” the Pres- 
ident began, but it was inter- 
rupted again by the soft whisper 
of the recording stenographer, 
listening intently to the ear- 
phones that brought news from 
outside. 

“Mr. President,” it whispered, 
“Mr. Trumie has passed the Navy 
Yard.” 

T he robots turned to look at 
the situation map. Bowling 
Green, though it smoldered in 
spots, had mostly gone back to 
blue. But the jagged oblong of 
the Yard flared red and bright. 
There was a faint electronic hum 
in the air, almost a sigh. 

The robots turned back to face 
each other. “Mr. President! I de- 
mand that the Defense Secre- 
tary explain the loss of the Graf 
Zeppelin and the 456th Bomb 
Group!” 

The Defense Secretary nodded 
to the Commissioner of Public 
Safety. “Mr. Trumie threw them 
away,” it said sorrowfully. 

Once again, that sighing elec- 



tronic drone from the assembled 
robots. 

The Coimcil fussed and fiddled 
with its papers, while the situa- 
tion map on the wall flared and 
dwindled, flared and dwindled. 

The Defense Secretary cleared 
its throat again. “Mr. President, 
there is no question that the, ah, 
absence of an effective air com- 
ponent will seriously hamper, not 
to say endanger, our prospects of 
a suitable landing. Nevertheless 

— and I say this, Mr. President, 
in full knowledge of the conclu- 
sions that may — indeed, should! 

— be drawn from such a state- 
ment — nevertheless, Mr. Presi- 
dent, I say that our forward ele- 
ments will successfully complete 
an assault landing—” 

“Mr. President!” The breath- 
less whisper of the blonde stenog- 
rapher again. “Mr. President, Mr. 
Trumie is in the building!” 

On the situation map behind it, 
the Pentagon — the building they 
were in — flared scarlet. 

The Attorney General, nearest 
the door, leaped to its feet. “Mr. 
President, I hear him!” 

And they could all hear now. 
Far off, down the long corridors, 
a crash. A faint explosion, and 
another crash, and a raging, quer- 
ulous, high-pitched voice. A 
nearer crash, and a sustained, 
smashing, banging sound, coming 
toward them. 

The oak-paneled doors flew 



THE MAN WHO ATE THE WORLD 



17 




open with a crash, splintering. 

A tall, dark male figure in gray 
leather jacket, rocket-gun holsters 
swinging at its hips, stepped 
through the splintered doors and 
stood surveying the Council. Its 
hands hung just below the butts 
of the rocket guns. 

It drawled: “Mistuh Anderson 
Trumie!” 

It stepped aside. Another male 
figure — shorter, darker, hobbling 
with the aid of a stainless steel 
cane that concealed a ray-pencil, 
wearing the same gray leather 
jacket and the same rocket-gun 
holsters — entered, stood for a mo- 
ment, and took position on the 
other side of the door. 

Between them, Mr. Anderson 
Trumie shambled ponderously 
into the Council Chamber to call 
on his Council. 

CONNY TRUMIE, come of 
^ age. He wasn’t much more 
than five feet tall, but his weight 
was close to four hundred pounds. 
He stood there in the door, lean- 
ing against the splintered oak, 
quivering jowls obliterating his 
neck, his eyes nearly swallowed 
in the fat that swamped his skull, 
his thick legs trembling as they 
tried to support him. 

“You’re all under arrest!” he 
screeched. “Traitors! Traitors!” 

He panted ferociously, glower- 
ing at them. They waited with 
bowed heads. Beyond the ring of 

18 



councilman, the situation map 
slowly blotted out the patches of 
red as the repair robots worked 
feverishly to fix what Sonny Tru- 
mie had destroyed. 

“Mr. Crockett!” Sonny cried 
shrilly. “Slay me these traitors!” 

Wheep-wheep, and the guns 
whistled out of their holsters into 
the tall bodyguard’s hands. Rata- 
tai-tat, and two by two, the nine- 
teen councilmen leaped, clutched 
at air and fell as the rocket pel- 
lets pierced them through. 

“That one, too!” Mr. Trumie 
pointed at the sweet-faced blonde. 

Bang. The sweet young face 
convulsed and froze; it fell, 
slumping across its little table. 

On the wall, the situation map 
flared red again, but only faintly 
— for what were twenty robots? 

Sonny gestured curtly to his 
other bodyguard. It leaped for- 
ward, tucking the stainless steel 
cane under one arm, putting the 
other around the larded shoulders 
of Sonny Trumie. “Ah, now, 
young master,” it crooned. “You 
just get ahold o’ Long John’s 
arm now—” 

“Get them fixed,” Sonny or- 
dered abruptly. He pushed the 
President of the Council out of 
its chair and, with the robot’s 
help, sank into it himself. “Get 
them fixed right, you hear? I’ve 
had enough traitors! I want them 
to do what I tell them!” 

“Sartin sure, young master. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Long John’ll be pleased to — ” 

“Do it now! And yon, Davey, 
I want my lunch!” 

“Reckoned you would, Mistuh 
Trumie. It’s right hyar.” The 
Crockett robot kicked the fallen 
councilmen out of the way as a 
procession of waiters filed in 
from the corridor. 

Sonny ate. 

He ate until eating was pain, 
and then he sat there sobbing, his 
arms braced against the tabletop, 
until he could eat more. 

The Crockett robot said wor- 
riedly: “Mistuh Trumie, mought- 
n’t you rear back a mite? Old 
Doc Aeschylus, he don’t hold 
with you eatin’ too much, you 
know.” 

“I hate Doc!” Trumie said bit- 
terly. 

He pushed the plates off the 
table. They fell with a rattle and 
a clatter, and they went spinning 
away as he heaved himself up 
and lurched alone over to the 
window. 

“I hate Doc!” he brayed again, 
sobbing, staring through tears out 
the window at his kingdom with 
its hurrying throngs and march- 
ing troops and roaring waterfront. 
The tallow shoulders tried to 
shake with pain. He felt as 
though hot cinderblocks were be- 
ing thrust down his throat, the 
ragged edges cutting, the hot 
weight crushing. 

“Take me back,” he wept to 



the robots. “Take me away from 
these traitors. Take me to my 
Private Place!” 

IV 

A S YOU see,” said Roosen- 
burg, “he’s dangerous.” 

Garrick looked out over the 
water, toward North Guardian. 
“I’d better look at his tapes,” he 
said. 

The girl swiftly picked up the 
reels and began to thread them 
into the projector. Dangerous. 
This Trumie indeed was danger- 
ous, Garrick conceded. Danger- 
ous to the balanced, stable world, 
for it only took one Trumie to 
topple its stability. It had taken 
thousands and thousands of years 
for society to learn its delicate 
tightrope walk. It was a matter 
for a psychist, all right. 

And Garrick was uncomfor- 
tably aware that he was only 
twenty-four. 

“Here you are,” said the girl. 

“Look them over,” Roosenburg 
suggested. “Then, after you’ve 
studied the tapes on Trumie, 
we’ve got something else. One of 
his robots. But you’ll need the 
tapes first.” 

“Let’s go,” said Garrick. 

The girl flicked a switch and 
the life of Anderson Trumie ap- 
peared before them, in color, in 
three dimensions — in miniature. 

Robots have eyes; and where 



THE MAN WHO ATE THE WORLD 



19 





the robots go, the eyes of Robot 
Central go with them. And the 
robots go everywhere. From the 
stored files of Robot Central 
came the spool of tape that was 
the frightful life story of Sonny 
Trumie. 

The tapes played into the 
globe-shaped viewer, ten inches 
high, a crystal ball that looked 
back into the past. First, from the 
recording eyes of the robots in 
Sonny Trumie’s nursery. The 
lonely little boy, twenty years 



before, lost in the enormous nurs- 
ery. 

“Disgusting!” breathed Kath- 
ryn Pender, wrinkling her nose. 
“How could people live like 
that?” 

Garrick said: “Please, let me 
watch this. It’s important.” 

In the gleaming globe, the lit- 
tle boy kicked at his toys, threw 
himself across his huge bed, 
sobbed. Garrick squinted, 
frowned, reached out, tried to 
make contact. It was hard. The 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




tapes showed the objective facts, 
but for a psychist, it was the sub- 
jective reality behind the facts 
that mattered. 

Kicking at his toys. Yes, but 
why? Because he was tired of 
them — and why was he tired? 
Because he feared them? Kicking 
at his toys. Because — because 
they were the wrong toys? Kick- 
ing — hate them! Don’t want 
them! Want — 

A bluish flare in the viewing 
globe. Garrick blinked and 

THE MAN WHO ATE THE WOR 



jumped, and that was the end of 
that section. 

^ I ’HE colors flowed and sud- 
-*■ denly jelled into bright life. 
Garrick recognized the scene aft- 
er a moment — it was right there 
in Fisherman’s Island, some pleas- 
ure spot overlooking the water. 
A bar, and at the end of it was 
Anderson Trumie at twenty, star- 
ing somberly into an empty glass. 
The view was through the eyes 
of the robot bartender. 

LD 21 





Anderson Tnimie was weeping. 

Gnce again, there was the ob- 
jective fact — but the fact behind 
the fact, what was it? Trumie had 
been drinking, drinking. Why? 

Drinking, drinking. 

With a sudden sense of shock, 
Garrick saw what the drink was 
— the golden, fizzy liquor. Not in- 
toxicating. Not habit-forming! 
Trumie had become no drunk. It 
was something else that kept him 
drinking, d/inking, must drink, 
must keep on drinking, or else — 

And again the bluish flare. 

There was more — Trumie fe- 
verishly collecting objects of art, 
Trumie decorating a palace, Tru- 
mie on a world tour, and Trumie 
returned to Fisherman’s Island. 

And then there was no more. 

“That,” said Roosenburg, “is 
the file. Of course, if you want 
the raw, unedited tapes, we can 
try to get them from Robot Cen- 
tral, but—” 

“No.” The way things were, it 
was best to stay away from Ro- 
bot Central; there might be more 
breakdowns and there wasn’t 
much time. Besides, something 
was beginning to suggest itself. 

“Run the first one again,” said 
Garrick. “I think maybe I’ll find 
something there.” 

G arrick made out a quick 
requisition slip and handed 
it to Kathryn Pender, who looked 
at it, raised her eyebrows, 

22 



shrugged and went off to have it 
filled. 

By the time she came back, 
Roosenburg had escorted Garrick 
to the room where the captured 
Trumie robot lay chained. 

“He’s cut off from Robot Cen- 
tral,” Roosenburg was saying. “I 
suppose you figured that out. 
Imagine! Not only has Trumie 
built a whole city for himself — 
but even his own Robot Central!” 

Garrick looked at the robot. It 
was a fisherman, or so Roosen- 
burg had said. It was small, dark, 
black-haired; possibly the hair 
would have been curly, if the sea 
water hadn’t plastered the curls 
to the scalp. It was still damp 
from the tussle that had landed it 
in the water and eventually into 
Roosenburg’s hands. 

Roosenburg was already at 
work. Garrick tried to think of 
the robot as a machine, but it 
wasn’t easy. The thing looked 
very nearly human — except for 
the crystal and copper that 
showed where the back of its 
head had been removed. 

“It’s as bad as a brain opera- 
tion,” said Roosenburg, working 
rapidly without looking up. “I’ve 
got to short out the input leads 
without disturbing the electronic 
balance — ” 

Snip, snip. A curl of copper fell 
free, to be grabbed by Roosen- 
burg’s tweezers. The fisherman’s 
arms and legs kicked sharply like 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




a dissected galvanized frog’s. 

Kathryn Pender said: “They 
found him this morning, casting 
nets into the bay and singing O 
Sole Mio. He’s from North Guar- 
dian, all right.” 

Abruptly the lights flickered 
and turned yellow, then slowly 
returned to normal brightness. 
Roger Garrick got up and walked 
over to the window. North Guar- 
dian was a haze of light in the 
sky, across the water. 

Click, snap. The fisherman ro- 
bot began to sing: 

T utte le serre, dopo quel fanal, 
Dietro la caserma, ti staro ed— 
Click. Roosenburg muttered 
under his breath and probed fur- 
ther. Kathryn Pender joined Gar- 
rick at the window. 

“Now you see,” she said. 
Garrick shrugged. “You can’t 
blame him.” 

“I blame him!” she said hotly. 
“I’ve lived here all my life. Fish- 
erman’s Island used to be a tour- 
ist spot — why, it was lovely here. 
And look at it now. The elevators 
don’t work. The lights don’t work. 
Practically all of our robots are 
gone. Spare parts, construction 
material, everything— it’s all gone 
to North Guardian! There isn’t a 
day that passes, Garrick, when 
half a dozen bargeloads of stuff 
don’t go north, because he requi- 
sitioned them. Blame him? I’d 
like to kill him!” 

Snap. Sputtersnap. The fisher- 



man lifted its head and caroled: 
Forse dommani, pian^erai, 

E dopo tu, sorriderai — 

T> OOSENBURG’S probe un- 
covered a flat black disc. 
“Kathryn, look this up, will you?” 
He read the serial number from 
the disc and then put down the 
probe. He stood flexing his fin- 
gers, looking irritably at the mo- 
tionless figure. 

Garrick joined him. Roosen- 
burg jerked his head at the fish- 
erman. 

“That’s robot repair work, try- 
ing to tinker with their insides. 
Trumie has his own Robot Cen- 
tral, as I told you. What I have 
to do is recontrol this one from 
the substation on the mainland, 
but keep its receptor circuits open 
to North Guardian on the sym- 
bolic level. You understand what 
I’m talking about? It’ll think 
from North Guardian, but act 
from the mainland.” 

“Sure,” said Garrick. 

“And it’s damned close work. 
There isn’t much room inside one 
of those things—” He stared at 
the figure and picked up the 
probe again. 

Kathryn Pender came back 
with a punchcard in her hand. “It 
was one of ours, all right. Used to 
be a busboy in the cafeteria at 
the beach club.” She scowled. 
“That Trumie!” 

“You can’t blame him,” Garrick 



THE MAN WHO ATE THE WORLD 



23 




said reasonably. “He’s only trying 
to be good.” 

She looked at him queerly. 
“He’s only-” 

Roosenburg interrupted with 
an exultant cry. “Got it! Okay, 
you — sit up and start telling us 
what Trumie’s up to now!” 

The fisherman figure said oblig- 
ingly, “Yes, Boss. What you 
wanna know?” 

What they wanted to know, 
they asked; and what they asked, 
it told them, volunteering noth- 
ing, concealing nothing. 

There was Anderson Trumie, 
king of his island, the compul- 
sive consumer. 

It was like an echo of the bad 
old days of the Age of Plenty, 
when the world was smothering 
under the endless, pounding flow 
of goods from the robot factories 
and the desperate race between 
consumption and production 
strained the whole society. But 
Trumie’s orders came not from 
society, but from within. Con- 
sume/ commanded something in- 
side him, and Use/ it cried, and 
.Devour/ it ordered. And Trumie 
obeyed, heroically. 

They listened to what the fish- 
erman robot had to say, and the 
picture was dark. Armies had 
sprung up on North Guardian; 
navies floated in its waters. An- 
derson Trumie stalked among his 
creations like a blubbery god, 
wrecking and ruling. Garrick 

24 



could see the pattern in what the 
fisherman had to say. In Trumie’s 
mind, he was dictator, building a 
war machine. He was supreme 
engineer, constructing a mighty 
state. He was warrior. 

was playing tin sol- 
diers,” said Roger Gar- 
rick, and Roosenburg and the girl 
nodded. 

“The trouble is,” Roosenburg 
said, “he has stopped playing. In- 
vasion fleets, Garrick! He isn’t 
content with North Guardian any 
more. He wants the rest of the 
country, too!” 

“You can’t blame him,” said 
Roger Garrick for the third time, 
and stood up. “The question is, 
what do we do about it?” 

“That’s what you’re here for,” 
Kathryn told him. 

“All right. We can forget about 
the soldiers — as soldiers, that is. 
They won’t hurt anyone. Robots 
can’t.” 

“I know that,” Kathryn 
snapped. 

“The problem is what to do 
about Trumie’s drain on the 
world’s resources.” Garrick pursed 
his lips. “According to my direc- 
tive from Area Control, the first 
plan was to let him alone — there 
is still plenty of everything for 
anyone, so why not let Trumie 
enjoy himself? But that didn’t 
work out too well.” 

“Didn’t work out too well,” re- 

6ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




peated Kathryn Pender bitterly. 

“No, no — not on your local 
level,” Garrick explained quickly. 
“After all, what are a few thou- 
sand robots, a few hundred mil- 
lion dollars’ worth of equipment? 
We could resupply this area in a 
week.” 

“And in a week,” said Roosen- 
burg, “Trumie would have us 
cleaned out again!” 

“That’s the trouble,” Garrick 
declared. “He doesn’t seem to 
have a stopping point. Yet we 
can’t refuse his orders. Speaking 
as a psychist, that would set a 
very bad precedent. It would put 
ideas in the minds of a lot of 
persons — minds that, in some 
cases, might not prove stable in 
the absence of a completely reli- 
able source of everything they 
need, on request. If we say no to 
Trumie, we open the door on some 
mighty dark corners of the hu- 
man mind. Covetousness. Greed. 
Pride of possession—” 

“So what are you going to do?” 
demanded Kathryn Pender. 

Garrick said resentfully: “The 
only thing there is to do. I’m go- 
ing to look over Trumie’s folder 
again. And then I’m going to 
North Guardian Island.” 

V 

T> OGER GARRICK was all too 
aware of the fact that he was 
only twenty-four. But his age 



couldn’t make a great deal of dif- 
ference. The oldest and wisest 
psychist in Area Control’s wide 
sphere might have been doubtful 
of success in as thorny a job as 
the one ahead. 

He and Kathryn Pender warily 
started out at daybreak. Vapor 
was rising from the sea about 
them, and the little battery-mo- 
tor of their launch whined softly 
beneath the keelson. Garrick sat 
patting the little box that con- 
tained their invasion equipment, 
while the girl steered. 

The workshops of Fisherman’s 
Island had been all night making 
some of the things in that box — 
not because they were so difficult 
to make, but because it had been 
a bad night. Big things were go- 
ing on at North Guardian; twice, 
the power had been out entirely 
for an hour, while the demand on 
the lines from North Guardian 
took all the power the system 
could deliver. 

The Sun was well up as they 
came within hailing distance of 
the Navy Yard. 

Robots were hard at work; the 
Yard was bustling with activity. 
An overhead traveling crane, 
eight feet tall, laboriously low- 
ered a prefabricated fighting top 
onto an eleven-foot aircraft car- 
rier. 

A motor torpedo boat — full- 
sized, this one was, not to scale — 
rocked at anchor just before the 



THE MAN WHO ATE THE WORLD 



25 





bow of their launch. Kathryn 
steered around it, ignoring the 
hail from the robot lieutenant-j.g. 
at its rail. 

She glanced at Garrick over 
her shoulder, her face taut. “It’s — 
it’s all mixed up.” 

Garrick nodded. The battle- 
ships were model-sized, the small 
boats full scale. In the city be- 
yond the Yard, the pinnacle of 
the Empire State Building barely 
cleared the Pentagon, right next 
door. A soaring suspension bridge 
leaped out from the shore a quar- 
ter of a mile away and stopped 
short a thousand yards out, over 
empty water. 

TT WAS easy to understand 
— even for a psychist just 
out of school, on his first real as- 
signment. Trumie was trying to 
run a world singlehanded, and 
where there were gaps in his con- 
ception of what his world should 
be, the results showed. 

“Get me battleships!” he or- 
dered his robot supply clerks, and 
they found the only battleships 
there were in the world to copy, 
the child-sized, toy-scaled play 
battleships that still delighted 
kids. 

“Get me an Air Force!” And a 
thousand model bombers were 
hastily put together. 

“Build me a bridge!” But per- 
haps he had forgotten to ' say to 
where. 

26 




^ ARRICK shook his head and 
focused on the world around 
him. Kathryn Pender was stand- 
ing on a gray steel stage, the 
mooring line from their launch 
secured to what looked like a coast 
defense cannon — but only about 
four feet long. Garrick picked up 
the little box and leaped up to 
the stage beside her. She turned 
to look at the city. 

“Hold on a second.” He was 
opening the box, taking out two 
little cardboard placards. He 
turned her by the shoulder and, 
with pins from the box, attached 
one of the cards to her back. 
“Now me,” he said, turning his 
back to her. 

She read the placard dubi- 
ously: 



I 

AM A 
SPY! 



“Garrick,” she said, “you’re sure 
you know what you’re doing?” 

“Put it on!” She shrugged and 
pinned it to the back of his 
jacket. 

Side by side, they entered the 
citadel of the enemy. 

According to the fisherman ro- 
bot, Trumie lived in a ginger- 
bread castle south of the Penta- 
gon. Most of the robots got no 
chance to enter it. The city out- 



THE MAN WHO ATE THE WORLD 



27 




side the castle was Trumie’s 
kingdom, and he roamed about 
it, overseeing, changing, destroy- 
ing, rebuilding. But inside the 
castle was his Private Place; the 
only robots that had both 
an inside- and outside-the-castle 
existence were the two body- 
guards of his youth, Davey 
Crockett and Long John Silver. 

“That,” said Garrick, “must be 
the Private Place.” 

It was decidedly a gingerbread 
castle. The “gingerbread” was 
stonework, gargoyles and col- 
umns; there were a moat and a 
drawbridge, and there were robot 
guards with crooked little rifles, 
wearing scarlet tunics and fur 
shakos three feet tall. The draw- 
bridge was up and the guards 
stood at stiff attention. 

“Let’s reconnoiter,” said Gar- 
rick. He was unpleasantly con- 
scious of the fact that every ro- 
bot they passed — and they had 
passed thousands — had turned to 
look at the signs on their backs. 

Yet it was right, wasn’t it? 
There was no hope of avoiding 
observation in any event. The 
only hope was to fit somehow 
into the pattern— and spies would 
certainly be a part of the military 
pattern. 

Wouldn’t they? 

^ ARRICK turned his back on 
doubts and led the way 
around the gingerbread palace. 

28 



The only entrance was the 
drawbridge. 

They stopped out of sight of 
the ramrod-stiff guards. Garrick 
said: “We’ll go in. As soon as we 
get inside, you put on your cos- 
tume.” He handed her the box. 
“You know what to do. All you 
have to do is keep him quiet for 
a while and let me talk to him.” 
“Garrick, will this work?” 
Garrick exploded: “How the 
devil do I know? I had Trumie’s 
dossier to work with. I know 
everything that happened to him 
when he was a kid — when this 
trouble started. But to reach him 
takes a long time, Kathryn. And 
we don’t have a long time. So — ” 
He took her elbow and marched 
her toward the guards. “So you 
know what to do,” he said. 

“I hope so,” breathed Kathryn 
Pender, looking very small and 
very young. 

They marched down the wide 
white pavement, past the motion- 
less guards— 

Something was coming toward 
them. Kathryn held back. 

“Come on!” Garrick muttered- 
“No, look!” she whispered. “Is 
that — is that Trumie?” 

He looked, then stared. 

It was Trumie, larger than life. 
It was Anderson Trumie, the en- 
tire human population of the 
most - congested - island - for - 
its-population in the world. On 
one side of him was a tall dark 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




figure, on the other side a squat 
dark figure, helping him along. 
His face was horror, drowned in 
fat. The bloated cheeks shook 
damply, wet with tears. The eyes 
squinted out with fright on the 
world he had made. 

Trumie and his bodyguards 
rolled up to them and past. And 
then Anderson Trumie stopped. 

He turned the blubbery head 
and read the sign on the back of 
the girl. I AM A SPY. Panting 
heavily, clutching the shoulder of 
the Crockett robot, he gaped 
wildly at her. 

Garrick cleared his throat. This 
far his plan had gone, and then 
there was a gap. There had to be 
a gap. Trumie’s history, in the 
folder that Roosenburg had sup- 
plied, had told him what to do 
with Trumie; and Garrick’s own 
ingenuity had told him how to 
reach the man. But a link was 
missing. Here was the subject, 
and here was the psychist who 
could cure him, and it was up to 
Garrick to start the cure. 

f I ''RUMIE cried out in a stac- 
cato bleat: “You! What are 
you? Where do you belong?” 

He was talking to the girl. Be- 
side him, the Crockett robot mur- 
mured: “Reckon she’s a spy, Mis- 
tuh Trumie. See thet sign a- 
hangin’ on her back?” 

“Spy? Spy?” The quivering lips 
pouted. “Curse you, are you Mata 



Hari? What are you doing out 
here? It’s changed its face,” Tru- 
mie complained to the Crockett 
robot. “It doesn’t belong here. It’s 
supposed to be in the harem. Go 
on, Crockett, get her back!” 

“Wait!” said Garrick, but the 
Crockett robot was ahead of him. 
It took Kathryn Pender by the 
arm. 

“Come along thar,” it said 
soothingly, and urged her across 
the drawbridge. She glanced back 
at Garrick, and for a moment it 
looked as though she were going 
to speak. Then she shook her 
head, as if giving an order. 

“Kathryn!” yelled Garrick. 
“Trumie, wait a minute! That 
isn’t Mata Hari!” 

No one was listening. Kathryn 
Pender disappeared into the Pri- 
vate Place. Trumie, leaning heav- 
ily on the hobbling Long John 
Silver robot, followed. 

Garrick, coming back to life, 
leaped after them. 

The scarlet-coated guards 
jumped before him, their shakos 
bobbing, their crooked little rifles 
crossed to bar his way. 

He ordered: “One side! Out of 
my way! I’m a human, don’t you 
understand? You’ve got to let me 
pass!” 

They didn’t even look at him; 
trying to get by them was like 
trying to walk through a wall of 
moving, thrusting steel. He shoved 
and they pushed him back; he

29 




tried to dodge and they were be- 
fore him. It was hopeless. 

And then it was hopeless in- 
deed, because behind them, he 
saw, the drawbridge had gone up. 

VI 

ONNY TRUMIE collapsed 
into a chair like a mound of 
blubber falling to the deck of a 
whaler. 

Though he made no signal, the 
procession of serving robots 
started at once. In minced the 
maitre d’, bowing and waving its 
graceful hands. In marched the 
sommelier, clanking its necklace 
of keys, bearing its wines in their 
buckets of ice. In came the lovely 
waitress robots and the sturdy 
steward robots, with the platters 
and tureens, the plates and bowls 
and cups. 

They spread a meal — a dozen 
meals — before him, and he began 
to eat. 

He ate as a penned pig eats, 
gobbling until it chokes, forcing 
the food down because there is 
nothing to do but eat. He ate, 
with a sighing accompaniment of 
moans and gasps, and some of the 
food was salted with the tears of 
pain he wept into it, and some of 
the wine was spilled by his shak- 
ing hand. But he ate. Not for the 
first time that day, and not for 
the tenth. 

Sonny Trumie wept as he ate. 



He no longer even knew he was 
weeping. There was the gaping 
void inside him that he had to 
fill, had to fill; there was the gap- 
ing world about him that he had 
to people and build and furnish 
. and use. 

He moaned to himself. Four 
hundred pounds of meat and lard, 
and he had to lug it from end to 
end of his island, every hour of 
every day, never resting, never 
at peace! There should have been 
a place somewhere, there should 
have been a time, when he could 
rest. When he could sleep with- 
out dreaming, sleep without wak- 
ing after a scant few hours with 
the goading drive to eat and to 
use, to use and to eat . 

And it was all so wrong! 

The robots didn’t understand. 
They didn’t try to understand: 
they didn’t think for themselves. 
Let him take his eyes from any 
one of them for a single day and 
everything went wrong. It was 
necessary to keep after them, 
from end to end of the island, 
checking and overseeing and or- 
dering — yes, and destroying to re- 
build, over and over! 

He moaned again and pushed 
the plate away. 

He rested, with his tallow fore- 
head flat against the table, wait- 
ing, while inside him the pain 
ripped and ripped, and finally be- 
came bearable again. And slowly 
he pushed himself up, and rested 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




for a moment, and pulled a fresh 
plate toward him, and began 
again to eat. 

A FTER a while, he stopped. 

Not because he didn’t want 
to go on, but because he abso- 
lutely couldn’t. 

He was bone-tired, but some- 
thing was bothering him — one 
more detail to check, one more 
thing that was wrong. Mata Hari. 
The houri at the drawbridge. It 
shouldn’t have been out of the 
Private Place. It should have 
been in the harem, of course. Not 
that it mattered, except to Sonny 
Trumie’s never-resting sense of 
what was right. 

Time was when the hour is of 
the harem had their uses, but that 
time was long and long ago; now 
they were property, to be fussed 
over and made to be right, to be 
replaced if they were worn, de- 
stroyed if they were wrong. But 
only property, as all of North 
Guardian was property — as all of 
the world would be his property, 
if only he could manage it. 

But property shouldn’t be 
wrong. 

He signaled to the Crockett ro- 
bot and, leaning on it, walked 
down the long terrazzo hall to- 
ward the harem. He tried to re- 
member what the houri had 
looked like. The face didn’t mat- 
ter; he was nearly sure it had 
changed it. It had worn a sheer 

THE MAN WHO ATE THE WORL 



red blouse tmd a brief red skirt, 
he was almost certain, but the 
face — 

It had had a face, of course. 
But Sonny had lost the habit of 
faces. This one had been some- 
how different, but he couldn’t re- 
member just why. Still — the 
blouse and skirt were red, he was 
nearly sure. And it had been car- 
rying something in a box. And 
that was odd, too. 

He waddled a little faster, for 
now he was positive it was wrong. 

“Thar’s the harem, Mistuh 
Trumie,” said the robot at his 
side. It disengaged itself gently, 
leaped forward and held the door 
to the harem for him. 

“Wait for me,” Sonny com- 
manded, and waddled forward 
into the harem halls. 

Once he had so arranged the 
harem that he needed no help in- 
side it; the halls were railed, at a 
height where it was easy for a 
pudgy hand to grasp the rail; the 
distances were short, the rooms 
close together. 

He paused and called over his 
shoulder: “Stay where you can 
hear me.” It had occurred to him 
that if the houri robot was wrong, 
he would need Crockett’s guns to 
make it right. 

A chorus of female voices 
sprang into song as he entered 
the main patio. They were a bevy 
of beauties, clustered around a 
fountain, diaphanously dressed, 

I 31 




iangudtbusly glancing at Sonny 
Trumie as he waddled inside. 

“Shut up!” he shrieked. “Go 
back to your rooms!” 

They bowed their heads and, 
one by one, slipped into the cu- 
bicles. 

No sign of the red blouse and 
the red skirt. He began the 
rounds of the cubicles, panting, 
peering into them. 

“Hello, Sonny,” whispered 
Theda Bara, lithe on a leopard 
rug, and he passed on. “I love 
you!” cried Nell Gwynn, and, 
“Come to me!” commanded Cleo- 
patra, but he passed them by. He 
passed Dubarry and Marilyn 
Monroe, he passed Moll Flanders 
and he passed Troy’s Helen. No 
sign of the houri in red — 

Yes, there was. He didn’t see 
the houri, but he saw the signs of 
the houri’s presence : the red 

blouse and the red skirt, lying 
limp and empty on the floor. 

Sonny gasped; “Where are 
you? Come out here where I can 
see you!” 

Nobody answered Sonny. 

“Come out!” he bawled. 

And then he stopped. A door 
opened and someone came out; 
not an houri, not female; a figure 
without sex but loaded with love, 
a teddy-bear figure, as tall as 
pudgy Sonny Trumie himself, 
waddling as he waddled, its 
stubby welcoming arms stretched 
out to him. 

32 



E COtTLD hardly believe his 
eyes. Its color was a little 
darker than Teddy. It was a good 
deal taller than Teddy. But un- 
questionably, undoubtedly, in 
everything that mattered, it was — 
“Teddy,” whispered Sonny Tru- 
mie, and let the furry arms go 
around his four htmdred pounds. 

Twenty years disappeared. 
“They wouldn’t let me have you,” 
Sonny told the teddy-bear. 

It said, in a voice musical and 
warm; “It’s all right. Sonny. You 
can have me now. Sonny. You 
can have everything. Sonny.” 
“They took you away,” he 
whispered, remembering. 

They took the teddy-bear 
away; he had never forgotten; 
They took it away and Mother 
was wild and Father was furious. 
They raged at the little boy and 
scolded him and threatened him. 
Didn’t he know they were poor, 
and Did he want to ruin them all, 
and What was wrong with him, 
anyway, that he wanted his little 
sister’s silly stuffed robots when 
he was big enough to use nearly 
grown-up goods? 

The night had been a terror, 
with the frowning, sad robots 
ringed around and the little girl 
crying; and what had made it 
terror was not the scolding — he’d 
had scoldings — but the worry, the 
fear and almost the panic in his 
parents’ voices. For what he did, 
he came to understand, was no 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





longer a (diildish sin. It was a big 
sin, a failure to consume his 
quota — 

And it had to be punished. 

The first punishment was the 
extra birthday party. 

The second was — shame. 

Sonny Trumie, not quite 
twelve, was made to feel shame 
and humiliation. Shame is only a 
little thing, but it makes the vic- 
tim of it little, too. 

Shame. 

The robots were reset to scorn 
him. He woke to mockery and 
went to bed with contempt. Even 
his little sister lisped the cata- 
logue of his failures. 

You aren’t trying. Sonny, and 
You don’t care. Sonny, and 
You’re a terrible disappointment 
to us, Sonny. 

And finally all the things were 
true, because Sonny at twelve was 
what his elders made him. 

And they made him . “neu- 
rotic” is the term; a pretty-sound- 
ing word that means ugly things 
like fear and worry and endless 
self-reproach . 

“Don’t worry,” whispered the 
Teddy. “Don’t worry. Sonny. You 
can have me. You can have what 
you want. You don’t have to have 
anything else.” 

VII 

^ ARRICK raged through the 
halls of the Private Place 
like a tiger. “Kathryn!” he 



shouted. “Kathi^ Pender!” 

The robots peeped out at him 
worriedly and sometimes they 
got in his way and he bowled 
them aside. They didn’t fight 
back, naturally — what robot 
would hurt a human? But some- 
times they spoke to him, plead- 
ing, for it was not according to 
the wishes of Mr. Tnunie that 
anyone but him rage destroying 
through North Guardian Island. 
Garrick passed them by. 

“Kathryn!” he called. “Kath- 
ryn!” 

He told himself fiercely: Tru- 
mie was not dangerous. Trumie 
was laid bare in his folder, the 
one that Roosenburg had sup- 
plied, and he couldn’t be blamed; 
he meant no harm. He was once 
a little boy who was trying to be 
good by consuming, consuming, 
and he wore himself into neurosis 
doing it; and then they changed 
the rules on him. End of the ra- 
tion, end of forced consumption, 
as the robots took over for man- 
kind at the other end of the farm- 
and-factory cornucopia. It wasn’t 
necessary to struggle to consume, 
so the rules were changed. 

And maybe Trumie knew that 
the rules had been changed, but 
Sonny didn’t. It was Sonny, the 
little boy trying to be good, who 
had made North Guardian Island. 

And it was Sonny who owned 
the Private Place and all it held 
— including Kathryn Pender. 



rHE MAN WHO ATE THE WORLD 



33 




Gi»t^V c<dIedhQ£usely: ‘^iath- 
ryiit If ycni hear me, answer me!” 

It had seemed so simple. The 
fulcrum on which the weight of 
Trumie’s neurosis might move 
was a teddy-bear. Give him a 
teddy-bear — or, perhaps, a teddy- 
bear suit, made by night in the 
factories of Fisherman’s Island, 
with a girl named Kathryn Pen- 
der inside — and let him hear, 
from a source he could trust, the 
welcome news that it was no 
longer necessary to struggle, that 
compulsive consumption could 
have an end. Then Garrick or 
any other psychist would clear 
it all up, but only if Trumie 
would listen. 

“Kathryn!” roared Roger Gar- 
rick, racing through a room of 
mirrors and carved statues. Be- 
cause, just in case Trumie didn’t 
listen, just in case the folder was 
wrong and Teddy wasn’t the 
key — 

Why, then, Teddy to Trumie 
would be only a robot. And Tru- 
mie destroyed them by the score. 

f^l^ATHRYN!” bellowed 
Roger Garrick, trotting 
through the silent palace, and at 
last he heard what might have 
been an answer. At least it was a 
voice — a girl’s voice, at that. He 
was before a passage that led to 
a room with a fountain and silent 
female robots, standing and 
watching him. The voice came 

34 



from a small room. He ran to the 
door. 

It was the right door. 

There was Trumie, four hun- 
dred pounds of lard, lying on a 
marble bench with a foam-rubber 
cushion, the jowled head in the 
small lap of — 

Teddy. Or Kathryn Pender in 
the teddy-bear suit, the sticklike 
legs pointed straight out, the 
sticklike arms clumsily patting 
him. She was talking to him, 
gently and reassuringly. She was 
telling him what he needed to 
know — that he had eaten enough, 
that he had used enough, that he 
had consumed enough to win the 
respect of all, and ari end to con- 
suming. 

Garrick himself could not have 
done better. 

It was a sight from Mother 
Goose, the child being soothed by 
his toy. But it was not a sight 
that fitted in well with its sur- 
roundings, for the seraglio was 
upholstered in mauve and pink, 
and the paintings that hung about 
were wicked. 

Sonny Trumie rolled the pen- 
dulous head and looked squarely 
at Garrick. The worry was gone 
from the fear-filled little eyes. 

Garrick stepped back. 

No need for him just at this 
moment. Let Trumie relax for a 
while, as he had not been able to 
relax for a score of years. Then 
the psychist could pick up where 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




the girl had been unable to pro- 
ceed, but in the meantime, Tru- 
mie was finally at rest. 

The Teddy looked up at Gar- 
rick and in its bright blue eyes, 
the eyes that belonged to the girl 
named Kathryn, he saw a queer 
tincture of triumph and com- 
passion. 

Garrick nodded, and left, and 
went out to the robots of North 
Guardian, and started them clear- 
ing away the monstrous child’s- 
eye conception of an empire. 

CONNY TRUMIE nestled his 
^ head in the lap of the teddy- 
bear. It was talking to him nicely, 
so nicely. It was droning away: 
“Don’t worry. Sonny. Don’t 
worry. Everything’s all right. 
Everything’s all right.” Why, it 
was almost as though it were real. 

It had been, he calculated with 
the part of his mind that was 
razor-sharp and never relaxed, 
nearly two hours since he had 
eaten. Two hours! And he felt as 
though he could go another hour 
at least, maybe two. Maybe — 
niaybe even not eat at all again 
that day. Maybe even learn to 



live on three meals. Perhaps two. 
Perhaps — 

He wriggled — as well as four 
hundred greasy pounds can wrig- 
gle — and pressed against the soft 
warm fur of the teddy-bear. It 
was so soothing. 

“You don’t have to eat so 
much. Sonny. You don’t have to 
drink so much. No one will mind. 
Your father won’t mind. Sonny. 
Your mother won’t mind . .” 

It was very comfortable to hear 
the teddy-bear telling him those 
things. It made him drowsy. So 
deliciously drowsy! It wasn’t like 
going to sleep, as Sonny Trumie 
had known going to sleep for a 
dozen or more years, the bitterly 
fought surrender to the anesthetic 
weariness. It was just drowsy. 

And he did want to go to sleep. 

And finally he slept. All of him. 
Not just the four hundred pounds 
of blubber and the little tor- 
mented eyes, but even the razor- 
sharp mind-Trumie that lived in 
the sad, obedient hulk. 

It slept. 

It had not slept all these twen- 
ty years.

D ane Phillips slouched 

in the window seat, watch- 
ing the morning crowds 
on their way to work and care- 
fully avoiding any attempt to 
read Jordan’s old face as the 
editor skimmed through the notes. 
He had learned to make his tall, 
bony body seem all loose-jointed 
relaxation, no matter what he 
felt. But the oversized hands in 
his pockets were clenched so 
tightly that the nails were cutting 
into his palms. 

Every tick of the old-fashioned 
clock sent a tbrob racing through 
his brain. Every rustle of the 



pages seemed to release a fresh 
shot of adrenalin into his blood 
stream. This time, his mind was 
pleading. It has to be right this 
time. 

Jordan finished his reading and 
shoved the folder back. He 
reached for his pipe, sighed, and 
then nodded slowly. “A nice job 
of researching, Phillips. And it 
might make a good feature for 
the Sunday section, at that.” 

It took a second to realize that 
the words meant acceptance, for 
Phillips had prepared himself too 
thoroughly against another fail- 
ure. Now he felt the tautened

muscles release, so quickly that 
he would have fallen if he hadn’t 
been braced against the seat. 

He groped in his mind, hunting 
for words, and finding none. 
There was only the hot, sudden 
flame of unbelieving hope. And 
then an almost blinding exulta- 
tion. 

J ORDAN didn’t seem to notice 
his silence. The editor made a 
neat pile of the notes, nodding 
again. “Sure. I like it. We’ve been 
short of shock stuff lately and 
the readers go for it when we 
can get a fresh angle. But nat- 
urally you’d have to leave out 
all that nonsense on Blanding. 
Hell, the man’s just buried, and 
his relatives and friends — ” 

“But that’s the proof!” Phillips 
stared at the editor, trying to 
penetrate through the haze of 
hope that had somehow grown 
chilled and unreal. His thoughts 
were abruptly disorganized and 
out of his control. Only the ur- 
gency remained. “It’s the key 
evidence. And we’ve got to move 
fast! I don’t know how long it 
takes, but even one more day 
may be too late!” 

Jordan nearly dropped the pipe 
from his lips as he jerked up- 
right to peer sharply at the 
younger man. “Are you crazy? Do 
you seriously expect me to get 
an order to exhume him now? 
What would it get us, other than 



lawsuits? Even if we could get 
the order without cause — which 
we can’t!” 

The the pipe did fall as he 
gaped open-mouthed. “My God, 
you believe all that stuff. You 
expected us to publish it straight!” 
“No,” Dane said thickly. The 
hope was gone now, as if it had 
never existed, leaving a numb 
emptiness where nothing mat- 
tered. “No, I guess I didn’t really 
expect anything. But I believe 
the facts. Why shouldn’t I?” 

He reached for the papers with 
hands he could hardly control 
and began stuffing them back 
into the folder. All the careful 
documentation, the fingerprints — 
smudged, perhaps, in some cases, 
but still evidence enough for any- 
one but a fool — 

“Phillips?” Jordan said ques- 
tioningly to himself, and then his 
voice was taking on a new edge. 
“Phillips! Wait a minute, I’ve got 
it now! Dane Phillips, not Arthur! 
Two years on the Trib. Then you 
turned up on the Register in Se- 
attle? Phillip Dean, or some such 
name there.” 

“Yeah,” Dane agreed. There 
was no use in denying anything 
now. “Yeah, Dane Arthur Phil- 
lips. So I suppose I’m through 
here?” 

Jordan nodded again and there 
was a faint look of fear in his 
expression. “You can pick up your 
pay on the way out. And make

it quick, before I change my mind 
and call the boys in white!” 

I T could have been worse. It had 
been worse before. And there 
was enough in the pay envelope 
to buy what he needed — a flash 
camera, a little folding shovel 
from one of the surplus houses, 
and a bottle of good scotch. It 
would be dark enough for him to 
taxi out to Oakhaven Cemetery, 
where Blanding had been buried. 

It wouldn’t change the minds 
of the fools, of course. Even if 
he could drag back what he might 
find, without the change being 
completed, they wouldn’t accept 
the evidence. He’d been crazy to 
think an3d:hing could change their 
minds. And they called him a 
fanatic! If the facts he’d dug up 
in ten years of hunting wouldn’t 
convince them, nothing would. 
And yet he had to see for himself, 
before it was too late! 

He picked a cheap hotel at 
random and checked in under an 
assumed name. He couldn’t go 
back to his room while there was 
a chance that Jordan still might 
try to turn him in. There wouldn’t 
be time for Sylvia’s detectives to 
bother him, probably, but there 
was the ever-present danger that 
one of the aliens might intercept 
the message. 

He shivered. He’d been risking 
that for ten years, yet the likeli- 
hood was still a horror to him. 



The uncertainty made it harder 
to take than any human-devised 
torture could be. There was no 
way of guessing what an alien 
might do to anyone who dis- 
covered that all men were not 
human — that some were . 
zombies. 

There was the classic syllo- 
gism; All men are mortal; I am 
a man; therefore, I am mortal. 
But not Blanding — or Corporal 
Harding. 

It was Harding’s “death” that 
had started it all during the fight- 
ing on Guadalcanal. A grenade 
had come flying into the foxhole 
where Dane and Harding had felt 
reasonably safe. The concussion 
had knocked Dane out, possibly 
saving his life when the enemy 
thought he was dead. He’d come 
to in the daylight to see Harding 
lying there, mangled and twisted, 
with his throat torn. There was' 
blood on Dane’s uniform, obvi- 
ously spattered from the dead 
man. It hadn’t been a mistake or 
delusion; Harding had been dead. 

It had taken Dane two days 
of crawling and hiding to get 
back to his group, too exhausted 
to report Harding’s death. He’d 
slept for twenty hours. And when 
he awoke, Harding had been 
standing beside him, with a whole 
throat and a fresh uniform, grin- 
ning and kidding him for running 
off and leaving a stunned friend 
behind.

It was no ringer, but Harding 
himself, complete to the smallest 
personal memories and person- 
ality traits. 

'T’HE PRESSURES of war 
probably saved Dane’s sanity 
while he learned to face the facts. 
All men are mortal; Harding is 
not mortal; therefore, Harding is 
not a man! Nor was Harding 
alone — Dane found enough evi- 
dence to know there were others. 

The Tribune morgue yielded 
even more data. A man had faced 
seven firing squads and walked 
away. Another survived over a 
dozen attacks by professional kill- 
ers. Fingerprints turned up mys- 
teriously “copied” from those of 
men long dead. Some of the aliens 
seemed to heal almost instantly; 
others took days. Some operated 
completely alone; some seemed 
to have joined with others. But 
they were legion. 

Lack of a clearer pattern of 
attack made him consider the 
possibility of human mutation, 
but such tissue was too wildly 
different, and the invasion had 
begun long before atomics or X- 
rays. He gave up trying to under- 
stand their alien motivations. It 
was enough that they existed in 
secret, slowly growing in numbers 
while mankind was unaware of 
them. 

When his proof was complete 
and irrefutable, he took it to his 



editor — to be fired, politely but 
coldly. Other editors were less 
polite. But he went on doggedly 
trying and failing. What else 
could he do? Somehow, he had to 
find the few people who could 
recognize facts and warn them. 
The aliens would get him, of 
course, when the story broke, but 
a warned humanity could cope 
with them. Ye shall know the 
truth, and the truth shall make 
you tree. 

Then he met Sylvia by accident 
after losing his fifth job — a girl 
who had inherited a fortune big 
enough to spread his message in 
paid ads across the country. They 
were married before he found she 
was hard-headed about her money. 
She demanded a full explanation 
for every cent beyond his allow- 
ance. In the end, she got the ex- 
planation. And while he was try- 
ing to cash the check she gave 
him, she visited Dr. Buehl, to 
come back with a squad of quiet, 
refined strong-arm boys who made 
sure Dane reached Buehl’s “rest 
home” safely. 

Hydrotherapy . Buehl as the 
kindly firm father image ... anal- 
ysis . hypnosis that stripped 
every secret from him, including 
his worst childhood nightmare. 

His father had committed a 
violent, bloody suicide after one 
of the many quarrels with Dane’s 
mother. Dane had found the body. 

Two nights after the funeral.

he had dreamed of his father’s 
face, horror-filled, at the window. 
He knew now that it was a nor- 
mal nightmare, caused by being 
forced to look at the face in the 
coffin, but the shock had lasted 
for years. It had bothered him 
again, after his discovery of the 
aliens, until a thorough check had 
proved without doubt that his 
father had been fully human, 
with a human, if tempestuous, 
childhood behind him. 

■T|R. BUEHL was delighted. 

“You see, Dane? You know 
it was a nightmare, but you don’t 
really believe it even now. Your 
father was an alien monster to 
you — no adult is quite human 
to a child. And that literal-minded 
self, your subconscious, saw him 
after he died. So there are alien 
monsters who return from death. 
Then you come to from a concus- 
sion. Harding is sprawled out un- 
conscious, covered with blood — 
probably your blood, since you 
say he wasn’t wounded, later. 

“But after seeing your father, 
you can’t associate blood with 
yourself — you see it as a horrible 
wound on Harding. When he 
turns out to be alive, you’re still 
in partial shock, with your sub- 
conscious dominant. And that has 
the answer already. There are 
monsters who come back from the 
dead! An exaggerated reaction, 
but nothing really abnormal. We’ll 



have you out of here in no time.” 

No non-directive psychiatry for 
Buehl. The man beamed pater- 
nally, chuckling as he added what 
he must have considered the 
clincher. “Anyhow, even zombies 
can’t stand fire, Dane, so you can 
stop worrying about Harding. I 
checked up on him. He was 
burned to a crisp in a hotel fire 
two months ago.” 

It was logical enough to shake 
Dane’s faith, until he came across 
Milo Blanding’s picture in a mag- 
azine article on society in St. 
Louis. According to the item, 
Milo was a cousin of the Blan- 
dings, whose father had vanished 
in Chile as a young man, and 
who had just rejoined the family. 
The picture was of Harding! 

An alien could have gotten 
away by simply committing sui- 
cide and being carried from the 
rest home, but Dane had to do 
it the hard way, watching his 
chance and using commando tac- 
tics on a guard who had come to 
accept him as a harmless nut. 

In St. Louis, he’d used the “Pur- 
loined Letter” technique to hide 
— going back to newspaper work 
and using almost his real name. 
It had seemed to work, too. But 
he’d been less lucky about Har- 
ding-Blanding. The man had been 
in Europe on some kind of a tour 
until his return only this last 
week. 

Dane had seen him just once

then — but long enough to be 
sure it was Harding — before he 
died again. 

This time, it was in a drunken 
auto accident that seemed to be 
none of his fault, but left his body 
a mangled wreck. 

T T WAS almost dark when 
■*- Dane dismissed the taxi at the 
false address, a mile from the 
entrance to the cemetery. He 
watched it turn back down the 
road, then picked up the valise 
with his camera and folding 
shovel. He shivered as he moved 
reluctantly ahead. War had 
proved that he would never be a 
brave man and the old fears of 
darkness and graveyards were 
still strong in him. But he had to 
know what the coffin contained 
now, if it wasn’t already too late. 

It represented the missing link 
in his picture of the aliens. What 
happened to them during the 
period of regrowth? Did they re- 
vert to their natural form? Were 
they at all conscious while the 
body reshaped itself into whole- 
ness? Dane had puzzled over it 
night after night, with no answer. 

Nor could he figure how they 
could escape from the grave. Per- 
haps a man could force his way 
out of some of the coffins he had 
inspected. The soil would still be 
soft and loose in the grave and 
a lot of the coffins and the boxes 
around them were strong in ap- 

42 



pearance only. A determined 
creature that could exist without 
much air for long enough might 
make it. But there were other 
caskets that couldn’t be cracked, 
at least without the aid of out- 
side help. 

What happened when a crea- 
ture that could survive even the 
poison of embalming fluids and 
the draining of all the blood 
woke up in such a coffin? Dane’s 
mind skitted from it, as always, 
and then came back to it re- 
luctantly. 

There were still accounts of 
corpses turned up with the nails 
and hair grown long in the grave. 
Could normal tissues stand the 
current tricks of the morticians 
to have life enough for such 
growth? The possibility was ab- 
surd. Those cases had to be aliens 
— ones who hadn’t escaped. Even 
they must die eventually in such 
a case — after weeks and months! 
It took time for hair to grow. 

And there were stories of 
corpses that had apparently 
fought and twisted in their coffins 
still. What was it like for an alien 
then, going slowly mad while it 
waited for true death? How long 
did madness take? 

He shivered again, but went 
steadily on while the cemetery 
fence appeared in the distance. 
He’d seen Blanding’s coffin — 
and the big, solid metal casket 
around it that couldn’t be cracked 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




by any amount of effort and 
strength. He was sure the creature 
was still there, unless it had a 
confederate. But that wouldn’t 
matter. An empty coffin would 
also be proof. 

r|ANE AVOIDED the main 
gate, unsure about whether 
there would be a watchman or 
not. A hundred feet away, there 
was a tree near the ornamental 
spikes of the iron fence. He threw 
his bag over and began shinnying 
up. It was difficult, but he made 
it finally, dropping onto the soft 
grass beyond. There was the trace 
of the Moon at times through the 
clouds, but it hadn’t betrayed 
him, and there had been no alarm 
wire along the top of the fence. 

He moved from shadow to 
shadow, his hair prickling along 
the base of his neck. Locating the 
right grave in the darkness was 
harder than he had expected, 
even with an occasional brief use 
of the small flashlight. But at 
last he found the marker that 
was serving until the regular mon- 
ument could arrive. 

His hands were sweating so 
much that it was hard to use the 
small shovel, but the digging of 
foxholes had given him experi- 
ence and the ground was still soft 
from the gravediggers’ work. He 
stopped once, as the Moon came 
out briefly. Again, a sound in the 
darkness above left him hovering 



and sick in the hole. But it must 
have been only some animal. 

He uncovered the top of the 
casket with hands already blister- 
ing. 

Then he cursed as he realized 
the catches were near the bottom, 
making his work even harder. 

He reached them at last, fum- 
bling them open. The metal top 
of the casket seemed to be a 
dome of solid lead, and he had no 
room to maneuver, but it began 
swinging up reluctantly, until he 
could feel the polished wood of 
the coffin. 

Dane reached for the lid with 
hands he could barely control. 
Fear was thick in his throat now. 
What could an alien do to a man 
who discovered it? Would it be 
Harding there — or some mon- 
strous thing still changing? How 
long did it take a revived mon- 
ster to go mad when it found no 
way to escape? 

He gripped the shovel in one 
hand, working at the lid with the 
other. Now, abruptly, his nerves 
steadied, as they had done when- 
ever he was in real battle. He 
swung' the lid up and began grop- 
ing for the camera. 

His hand went into the silk- 
lined interior and found nothing! 
He was too late. Either Harding 
had gotten out somehow before 
the final ceremony or a confeder- 
ate had already been here. The 
coffin was empty.

T here were no warning 
sounds this time — only hands 
that slipped under his arms and 
across his mouth, lifting him 
easily from the grave. A match 
flared briefly and he was looking 
into the face of Buehl’s chief 
strong-arm man. 

“Hello, Mr. Phillips. Promise 
to be quiet and we’ll release you. 
Okay?” At Dane’s sickened nod, 
he gestured to the others. “Let 
him go. And, Tom, better get 
that filled in. We don’t want any 
trouble from this.” 

Surprise came from the grave 
a moment later. “Hey, Burke, 
there’s no corpse here!” 

Burke’s words killed any hopes 
Dane had at once. “So what? 
Ever hear of cremation? Lots 
of people use a regular coffin for 
the ashes.” 

“He wasn’t cremated,” Dane 
told him. “You can check up on 
that.” But he knew it was useless. 

“Sure, Mr. Phillips. We’ll do 
that.” The tone was one reserved 
for humoring madmen. Burke 
turned, gesturing. “Better come 
along, Mr. Phillips. Your wife 
and Dr. Buehl are waiting at the 
hotel.” 

The gate was open now, but 
there was no sign of a watchman; 
if one worked here, Sylvia’s 
money would have taken care of 
that, of course. Dane went along 
quietly, sitting in the rubble of 
his hopes while the big car purred 

44 



through the morning and on 
down Lindell Boulevard toward 
the hotel. Once he shivered, and 
Burke dug out hot brandied cof- 
fee. They had thought of every- 
thing, including a coat to cover 
his dirt-soiled clothes as they took 
him up the elevator to where 
Buehl and Sylvia were waiting 
for him. 

She had been crying, obviously, 
but there were no tears or re- 
criminations when she came over 
to kiss him. Funny, she must still 
love him — as he’d learned to his 
surprise he loved her. Under dif- 
ferent circumstances . 

“So you found me?” he asked 
needlessly of Buehl. He was op- 
erating on purely automatic 
habits now, the reaction from the 
night and his failure numbing 
him emotionally. “Jordan got in 
touch with you?” 

Buehl smiled back at him. “We 
knew where you were all along, 
Dane. But as long as you acted 
normal, we hoped it might be 
better than the home. Too bad 
we couldn’t stop you before you 
got all mixed up in this.” 

“So I suppose I’m committed 
to your booby-hatch again?” 

Buehl nodded, refusing to re- 
sent the term. “I’m afraid so, 
Dane — for a while, anyhow. 
You’ll find your clothes in that 
room. Why don’t you clean up a 
little? Take a hot bath, maybe. 
You’ll feel better.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




ANE went in, svirprised when 
no guards followed him. But 
they had thought of everything. 
What looked like a screen on the 
window had been recently in- 
stalled and it was strong enough 
to prevent his escape. Blessed 
are the poor, for they shall be 
poorly guarded! 

He was turning on the shower 
when he heard the sound of 
voices coming through the door. 
He left the water running and 
came back to listen. Sylvia was 
speaking. 

“—seems so logical, so com- 
pletely rational.” 

“It makes him a dangerous per- 
son,” Buehl answered, and there 
was no false warmth in his voice 
now. “Sylvia, you’ve got to admit 
it to yourself. All the reason and 
analysis in the world won’t con- 
vince him he’s wrong. This time 
we’ll have to use shock treatment. 
Burn over those memories, fade 
them out. It’s the only possible 
course.” 

There was a pause and then a 
sigh. “I suppose you’re right.” 

Dane didn’t wait to hear more. 
He drew back, while his mind 
fought to accept the hideous re- 
ality. Shock treatment! The 
works, if what he knew of psy- 
chiatry was correct. Enough of it 
to erase his memories — a part 
of himself. It wasn’t therapy 
Buehl was considering; it couldn’t 
be. 



It was the answer of an alien 
that had a human in its hands — 
one who knew too much! 

He might have guessed. What 
better place for an alien than in 
the guise of a psychiatrist? Where 
else was there the chance for all 
the refined, modern torture 
needed to burn out a man’s mind? 
Dane had spent ten years in fear 
of being discovered by them — 
and now Buehl had him. 

Sylvia? He couldn’t be sure. 
Probably she was human. It 
wouldn’t make any difference. 
There was nothing he could do 
through her. Either she was part 
of the game or she really thought 
him mad. 

Dane tried the window again, 
but it was hopeless. There would 
be no escape this time. Buehl 
couldn’t risk it. The shock treat- 
ment — or whatever Buehl would 
use under the name of shock 
treatment — would begin at once. 
It would be easy to slip, to use an 
overdose of something, to make 
sure Dane was killed. Or there 
were ways of making sure it 
didn’t matter. They could leave 
him alive, but take his mind away. 

In alien hands, human psychi- 
atry could do worse than all the 
medieval torture chambers! 

T he SICKNESS grew in his 
stomach as he considered the 
worst that could happen. Death 
he could accept, if he had to. He

could even face the chance of 
torture by itself, as he had ac- 
cepted the danger while trying to 
have his facts published. But to 
have his mind taken from him, a 
step at a time — to watch his 
personality, his ego, rotted away 
under him — and to know that 
he would wind up as a drooling 
idiot . 

He made his decision, almost 
as quickly as he had come to re- 
alize what Buehl must be. 

There was a razor in the medi- 
cine chest. It was a safety razor, 
of course, but the blade was sharp 
and it would be big enough. 
There was no time for careful 
planning. One of the guards 
might come in at any moment if 
they thought he was taking too 
long. 

Some fear came back as he 
leaned over the wash basin, star- 
ing at his throat, fingering the 
suddenly murderous blade. But 
the pain wouldn’t last long — a 
lot less than there would be under 
shock treatment, and less pain. 
He’d read enough to feel sure of 
that. 

Twice he braced himself and 
failed at the last second. His 
mind flashed out in wild schemes, 
fighting against what it knew had 
to be done. 

The world still had to be 
warned! If he could escape, some- 
how ... if he could still find a 
way . He couldn’t quit, no 

46 



matter how impossible things 
looked. 

But he knew better. There was 
nothing one man could do against 
the aliens in this world they had 
taken over. He’d never had a 
chance. Man had been chained al- 
ready by carefully developed ridi- 
cule against superstition, by care- 
fully indoctrinated gobbledegook 
about insanity, persecution com- 
plexes, and all the rest. 

For a second, Dane even con- 
sidered the possibility that he 
was insane. But he knew it was 
only a blind effort to cling to life. 
There had been no insanity in 
him when he’d groped for evi- 
dence in the coffin and found it 
empty! 

He leaned over the wash basin, 
his eyes focused on his throat, 
and his hand came down and 
around, carrying the razor blade 
through a lethal semicircle.

give place to sickness on his 
face as the pain lanced through 
him and the blood spurted.

replace the sickness while the 
bleeding stopped and the gash

T he words which have to 
preface this column were 
written quite a number of 
years ago, namely around the year 
1870. Their author was Jules 
Verne, but he did not write them 
for publication, for they occur in 
a letter he wrote to his father. In 
the original, they read: Tout ce

iner, (fautres hommes seront 
capables de le realiser, which

translates as “everything one man 
is capable of imagining, other 
men will be capable of realizing.” 

In other words, Jules Verne 
took the position that the imagi- 
nation of one man, namely the 
writer, will forecast the shape of 
things to come. It is too bad that 
he never wrote an essay on the 
role of science fiction. It would 
be interesting to see whether he 
would have analyzed his own 
contribution not just as some- 
thing loosely called “imagina- 
tion,” but more precisely as what 
is now called “extrapolation.” Be- 
cause if you examine just Jules 
Verne’s work carefully, you’ll find 
that he was the extrapolator 
extraordinary and that his “im- 
agination” was carefully directed 
into directions given by known 
facts. 

I am not diverging from the 
theme myself when I tell that 
it happens quite often to me, 
usually before lectures, that local 
newspaper reporters, assigned to 
a routine interview, try to get 
some special color into it by 
asking for a little rundown on 
things “invented” by science fic- 
tion writers. By this they mean 
devices or machines described 
with reasonable accuracy first in 
a story and now reality. 

The list of such inventions 
actually is much shorter than one 
should think at first glance and 
so, most of the time, a note of 

48 



disappointment creeps into the 
interview rather soon. 

S O Jules Verne prophesied the 
long-range submarine, as 
everybody knows. In the process 
of describing its workings, he 
“invented” the periscope. Then I 
say; “Yes, and he named his 
fictional submarine Nautilus be- 
cause that was the name that 
Robert Fulton had given to his 
small experimental submarine 
which he tried in the Seine River 
in France and which did not 
have a periscope.” 

I then want to go on and say 
that the first atomic submarine 
received the same name to honor 
both, but usually I don’t get that 
far because I am interrupted by 
the surprised question : “You 
mean to say there actually were 
functioning subs before Jules 
Verne’s time?” On one occasion, 
the reporter was so keenly disap- 
pointed that he threw this partic- 
ular sheet of his notes into the 
wastepaper basket. This, to his 
mind, was no longer a story. 

The fact is, of course, that it 
is the story. 

The actual discovery of some- 
thing new and, as a rule, the first 
model of a possible practical 
application of that discovery gen- 
erally came from a scientist (or, 
in the past, a professional inven- 
tor who may be termed an 
“applied scientist”). 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




What the writer like Jules 
Verne did was to see clearly be- 
fore his mind’s eye what the 
future of this invention could be. 
Being a writer, he told it in terms 
of fictional action. And to the 
reading public, the facts often be- 
came known through the fiction- 
alized version first, so that the 
public acquired the habit of 
crediting the writer not only with 
the story but with the discovery, 
too. 

Actually the scientists came 
first in the vast majority of all 
the cases, as was mentioned in 
this column a few months ago, 
with reference to cotnra-terrene 
matter. Ex-editor Sam Moskowitz 
discovered to his surprise recently 
that the spaceships of science fic- 
tion became rockets only after 
Goddard and Oberth had pub- 
lished their mathematical studies 
of propulsion in a vacuum. 

(There are one and half excep- 
tions to this statement. The 
Frenchman Achilla Eyraud, in 
1865, hit on a moteur a reaction 
for his ship and, thirty years 
later, the German Kurd Lasswitz 
“invented” a rocket-type propul- 
sion mechanism which he called 
“repulsor.” Lasswitz is the “half 
exception,” for while he wrote 
about the device in a space-travel 
novel, he was a scientist in daily 
life.) 

Keeping in mind that the 
writer, though he does the major 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



job of prophesying, usually gets 
the fundamental idea from the 
scientist, we can get down to 
cases. And I’ll begin with the very 
rare and possibly unique case of 
one of these “prophets” who was 
essentially an artist rather than 
a writer. He happened to be a 
Frenchman, too; his name was 
Albert Robida and he was bom 
in 1848. He had his floruit, as 
bibliographers like to put it, 
around 1882-1883, when he was 
about 35 years old. 

A T that time, the electric tele- 
graph was firmly established, 
but Heinrich Hertz had not yet 
discovered the waves at first 
named after him. Other inven- 
tions utilizing electric current had 
just been born. 

Alexander Graham Bell re- 
ceived his patents in 1876 and 
1877. In October, 1879, Thomas 
Alva Edison’s electric lamp 
burned for the first time in his 
laboratory. Two years prior to 
that date, Edison had received 
the first patent for his phono- 
graph. 

Somebody who carefully fol- 
lowed the announcements about 
inventions — we know that Jules 
Verne did and can safely assume 
that Robida also did — could 
know that it was possible to speak 
over a wire and that sound could 
be recorded directly, without the 
detour via the written word. But

Rebida't ''spoken newspaper" on the breakfast table. Aside from the old-fashioned design, 

this looks "normal" to us 



no commercial use was really 
in sight at the moment. 

Robida thought of one: the 
“spoken newspaper” at breakfast 
time (Fig. 1.), the radio of today. 
Since the very term newspaper 
implied reporters, Robida in- 
vented the roving reporter com- 
plete with microphone (Fig. 2). 

Two things are most interest- 
ing about this picture. One is the 
result of the knowledge of the 
time: The reporter’s microphone 
is not a walkie-talkie, since radio 
waves were still unknown, so the 
reporter trails a cable. But Ro- 
bida put a “magic eye” in his 
other hand — we would call it 
a TV camera. Robida must have 
reasoned by analogy that if sound 
could be both transmitted and 
recorded and a picture could be 

so 



recorded (professional and ama- 
teur photographers already num- 
bered many thousands in his 
day), it seemed likely that a 
picture might be transmitted, too, 
in some manner. 

As if this single item in the 
picture of the reporter might not 
be enough to establish him as 
the prophet of television with 
posterity, Robida did portray 
television in the home (Fig. 3), 
not quite in a form which is now 
in use, but close enough to it to 
eliminate all argument. 

It is always said that the tank 
is an invention of H. G. Wells 
and was born with his story The 
Land Ironclads, first published 
in the December, 1903, issue of 
The Strand Magazine. But one 
can make a strong case for Ro-

first air-to-air missile. It appeared 
on the cover of a German pulp 
magazine around 1909 or early 
1910. I cannot illustrate it for 
the simple reason that I could 
not find files of that old magazine 
(more accurately, “dime novel”) 
in a library. 

As I remember the cover, this 
missile bore a surprising resem- 
blance to the German Henschel 
Hs-293 air-to-ground missile of 



bida, who had tanklike war ma- 
chines in 1883 (Fig. 4). The one 
thing against the claim for Robida 
is that his “tanks” still ran on 
rails. 

There are precisely 20 years 
between Robida’s engines and 
Wells’ “land ironclads.” But pre- 
cisely ten years after the one and 
ten years prior to the other, 
namely in 1893, Mr. Frank Reade, 
Jr., had a tank (Fig. 5) which 
not only did not need rails, but 
was even amphibious! 

'’I '*HE next case is one I im- 
fortunately cannot illustrate; 
it is, to my knowledge, the

don’t dare to go so far as to 
print a picture of the Hs-293 and 
say that this was drawn for the 
first time in 1909. But I am cer- 
tain about the story background 
for the cover painting. 

From 1909 till 1914, somebody 
in Germany wrote science fiction 
dime novels with the overall title 
“Captain Mors, Pirate of the Air.” 
Of course, you understand that 
this Captain Mors was a very 
benevolent pirate who took from 

52 



the rich to support the poor. 

He made his first appearance 
with a zeppelin-type airship of 
astonishing capabilities and de- 
clared himself Master of the Air, 
not permitting anybody else to 
fly. (Later, after he had built 
himself an even more astonishing 
spaceship, he relented somewhat 
and let others share the air with 
him.) But at the period when he 
was still objecting to other 
people’s airships, these other 
people banded together to blast 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




The tank, according to Frank Reade, Jr. 



him out of the air. 

English, French and Belgian 
airships attack his ship directly 
with cannon and machine guns 
and are easily defeated. But while 
Captain Mors is occupied in this 
manner, the Russian airship 
climbs to a higher altitude so far 
away that there cannot be any 
menace from the Russian ship as 
far as airborne artillery goes. 

But the Russians do not carry 
artillery — they release air-to-air 
missiles! Captain Mors can save 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



his ship and his skin only by su- 
perior speed and frantic and skill- 
ful maneuvering. 

Even here, though, the author 
of the story (who wrote anony- 
mously) and his illustrator 
(equally anonymous) probably 
received the germ of the idea 
from practical science. Early in 
the present century, a Swedish 
artillery officer, Baron von Unge, 
had tried to re-introduce the war 
rocket, first as a ground-to-ground 
weapon like howitzers. When that 

53 





The 75-milliineter Skysweeper autematic cannon which combines radar, flight-track 
computer and rapid-fire gun 



(U. S. Army Photograph) 



did not work out too well, he ar- 
gued that rocket-propelled mis- 
siles were the ideal weapons for 
airships to use against other air- 
ships, since both the weight and 
the recoil of cannon were lacking. 

(Note in passing: An Ameri- 
can airship inventor. General 
Thayer, had made it a point that 
the cannon of his airship should 
fire in the direction of the tail 
end of the ship, so that their re- 
coil would aid in the propulsion 
of the ship.) 

The idea of the air-to-air mis- 
sile had been conceived by the 
Baron von Unge, but von Unge 
had unwinged rockets in mind. 



The anonymous author described 
(and his illustrator drew) a 
winged missile which, I seem to 
remember, was even controlled 
from the mother ship in some 
manner. This was evidently a 
“shot in the dark” which hap- 
pened to hit. 

ZITHERS of the kind were 
^^yet to come. The science fic- 
tion writers of the 1920s were 
obviously under the influence of 
the First World War, which had 
just ended. They wrote tirelessly 
about future wars and, by in- 
venting a large number of future 
weapons, they did come up with

guns. All the gunners had to do 
was to see to it that the shell- 
feeding mechanism functioned 
properly. There is now such a 
g\m (Fig. 6), the Sksrsweeper. 

I have been told that the man 
who originally wrote the Buck 
Rogers stories and invented the 
character made a rather good 
forecast of the Bazooka in one 
of his stories. Since I haven’t 
read the story myself, I can only 
report this as hearsay. 

Of course Dr. E. E. Smith can 
take credit for having predicted 
radar, with the “detector screens 
driven with the utmost power.” 
While he did not describe just 
how the detector screens worked, 
the similarity between what they 
were supposed to do and what 
radar really does is striking. 

At one time during the last 
phase of the Second World War 

— between VE Day and VJ Day 

— I loaned a boxful of magazines 
to somebody who wanted to 
know what science fiction was. 
When the magazines were re- 
turned to me, there was a long 
evening of discussion and one of 
the questions that came up was: 
“Do you know why Dr. Smith did 
not say ‘radar’ when he described 
the detector screens? Radar is a 
much better word.” Well, I did 
know. 

Now I can’t say whether the 
detector screens were one of these 
“shots in the dark” or whether Dr. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



Smith did go by a prior an- 
nouncement from scientific 
sources. I don’t think he did, but 
he could have. About 1906, 
Guglielmo Marconi delivered a 
lecture on radio waves and their 
transmission. He made reference 
to the fact that radio waves are 
reflected by solid objects and said 
that this characteristic might be 
used, one day, “to detect ob- 
stacles at sea either in darkness 
or in bad weather.” 

Yes, this lecture was printed; 
otherwise I wouldn’t know about 
it myself, for when it was origi- 
nally delivered, I was getting 
ready to be born. 

A very typical “shot in the 
dark” was the repeated men- 
tion of unbreakable glass in many 
stories. That there would be such 
glass at some time seemed logi- 
cal. Now we have not one but 
two substances which fit the 
label. The one is actually a type 
of glass, virtually unbreakable. 
The other is transparent plastic, 
best known under its trade name 
of Incite. 

Lucite has a strange character- 
istic which would have made 
wonderful story material if it had 
been foreseen. It can be used to 
“pipe light” around comers (Fig. 
7) and the fact that the light- 
piping rod in the picture is visible 
at all is due to an “imperfection.” 
If it had an absolutely smooth 



57 




surface, no light would emerge 
through the sides; the rod would 
look dark with only a beam com- 
ing out of its end. 

How science fiction forecast 
the atomic bomb has been told 
and retold so many times that I 
would not even mention it here 
if it weren’t for one thing — 
namely, the people who, tell the 
story do not seem to be ac- 
quainted with the story in which 
atomic bombs and atomic artil- 
lery appeared for really the first 
time. 

I can’t recall the name of the 
author, but the title of the story 
was The Final War and it ap- 
peared in one of Hugo Gerns- 
back’s magazines. The bombs and 
shells that end the war are not 
only “atomic” in the amount of 
destruction they cause; at one 
point earlier in the story, an in- 
vestigator makes specific refer- 
ence to the “nuclei”— something 
which was not very meaningful 
to the readers. 

To end on a peaceful note, one 
of the neatest predictions ever to 
come out of science fiction is 
Heinlein’s “waldos.” If you have 
read the story, you’ll remember 
that the hero is suffering from ex- 
treme muscular weakness of such 
a pronounced type that he lives 
on an artificial satellite in free 
fall around the Earth. To do 
things, he relies on an invention 
of his own. He slips his hands 

58 



into something resembling a pair 
of gloves and, elsewhere, dupli- 
cate hands of different sizes and 
strengths do with force what the 
weak hands of the inventor 
feebly direct. 

These ‘Svaldos” are with us in 
considerable number. The first 
ones I know of were developed 
for the Atomic Energy Commis- 
sion for the remote handling of 
radioactive materials; they re- 
ceived the somewhat stiff name of 
“manipulators.” To make it easy 
to learn to handle them, they 
usually have a “1 to 1 power 
translation.” In other words, the 
mechanical hand inside the radio- 
active area exerts the same pres- 
sure as the operator’s real hand on 
the outside. If you press strongly 
enough to crush a beaker directly 
in your hand — not really a rec- 
ommended procedure — the me- 
chanical hand will crush it, too. 
But there are mechanical arms in 
which the power can be stepped 
up. 

nPHE latest wrinkle in the se- 
ries of “remote hands” is 
something that General Electric 
has named “Yes-Man.” At one 
end there is the “master,” a kind 
of harness with elbows, wrists, 
hands and fingers. 

The “master” is worn by the 
real master, namely the operator. 

At the other end there is the 
“slave,” which is a set of me- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




chanical arms with elbows, wrists, 
hands and fingers. 

“Yes-Man” slave does what the 
master does. It does not even 
have to be near. The “master” 
could be directed in New York 
and the “slave” could perform in 
Boston. Moreover, there could be 
“slaves” in Chicago, San Fran- 
cisco, Hollywood and Palm 
Beach all doing what the “master 
in New York is doing.” 

This, Moscow may say, is what 
Wall Street always wanted. Seri- 
ously, the “Yes-Man” is also de- 
signed to work in either radioac- 
tive or otherwise unhealthy areas. 
It could be used in a room which 
is filled with live steam 600 de- 
grees hot. It could perform in a 
room where a container filled 
with a poisonous gas has burst. It 
could be used to de-fuze a shell 
or bomb. And since there could 
be hundreds of slaves hooked up 
to one master, it might be used in 
some instances for assembly op- 
erations requiring long practice. 



So far, all this has been pretty 
serious. The ending in a lighter 
vein was created, or at least un- 
veiled, just a few days before I 
started writing the column for this 
issue. 

Remember the Liquor Organ 
which was such an essential in- 
gredient in a series of Kuttner 
stories? Well, it now exists. There 
now is a mechanical bartender 
where you only have to push a 
few buttons — I am told that the 
combinations are easy to learn — 
to get the drink you want in the 
mixture ratio you prefer. All you 
have to do, in addition to push- 
ing buttons, is to see that the at- 
tachments which hold the bottles 
do hold bottles with something 
in them. 

But there is a drawback to 
everything. 

The thing costs four thousand 
dollars, which makes it one of the 
cases where human help is de- 
cidedly cheaper.

I could help him, that old man 
waiting patiently on the Moon — 

but not after what I had done! 



W E HIT the Moon just as 
the terminator was bi- 
secting Tycho. It was a 
pretty sight with the sharp, black- 
ink shadows etched across the 
plains and the tips of the moun- 
tains limned with light, but to me 
it was bad timing. Landing isn’t 
as hard as it used to be and the 
automatics have taken the danger 
from a nightside touchdown, but 
I liked to see where I was going. 
So I orbited a couple of times un- 



til the land field was clear, then 
killed velocity, swung up the nose 
and let the ground-based radar 
pilot take over. 

We hardly felt the shock of 
landing. 

Dumarest was, as usual, eager 
to stretch his legs. French, the 
third member of the crew, packed 
his instruments, completed his log 
and, by the time Dumarest had 
damped the pile and made all se- 
cure, was ready for the monitor.

I joined them at the airlock with 
the cargo manifests, log and ship’s 
papers in their folder under my 
arm. None of us carried much in 
the way of baggage, for weight 
was still an item on the ships and 
there was no profit in paying for 
excess. 

The monitor crawled from the 
station toward us, rammed the 
plastic union against the hull over 
the airlock, signaled and waited 
for us to imseal and enter. Her- 
man was the driver and he nodded 
to me as I sat beside him. 

“Good trip?” 

“The usual.” I watched as the 
maintenance crew entered the 
ship and shut the door behind 
them. Herman dogged shut our 
compartment, hit the bleed-valve 
and, as the air spilled from the 
union, pulled free of the ship and 
headed toward the station. 

'^I’HE cargo monitors passed us, 
going in the opposite direc- 
tion, before we had gone halfway. 
They crawled over the dust on 
their way to the ship, big, un- 
gainly things, but far better than 
the old days when cargo had to 
be man-handled by men in space- 
suits. Now it was an easy ship-to- 
monitor - to - storage - dome, with 
men working in air all the time. 
I guessed that it would only be a 
matter of time before the ships 
themselves were brought within 
a dome, too. 



Nobody spoke on the ride to 
the station. To Herman, it was 
routine; to us, it was the end of a 
journey, with the inevitable let- 
down at the end of anticipation. 
For a couple of weeks, we would 
loaf, drink, talk, see what sights 
were to be seen, maybe even take 
a trip down to Earth. Then back 
into space again, to Mars or 
Venus or maybe Mercury, inter- 
planetary bus-drivers wet-nursing 
a cargo of supplies and machin- 
ery on the way out and valuable 
minerals on the way in. I’d done 
it for fifteen years and it was like 
living at the bottom of an ever- 
deepening rut. 

“I wonder if he’s there,” said 
Dumarest. The monitor had 
stopped within the outer dome 
and he led the way out. 

French shrugged. “I guess so, 
unless he’s dead. What do you 
think, Frank?” 

I didn’t answer. 

“Every trip the same,” said Du- 
marest. “It’s getting so I expect 
old man Thorne to be waiting for 
me. It’s like seeing the Earth, 
something you get to rely on.” 

We passed from the entry port 
into Reception. 

“He’s there,” said Dumarest. 
“Just the same as always.” He 
chuckled. “Good old Thorne, he 
never lets you down.” 

Thorne stood by the exit of Re- 
ception, just within the short cor- 
ridor leading to the living quar- 



vieii

ters. A thin, withered scrap of a 
man, his shoulders stooped de- 
spite the low gravity, his hair in 
fading brown streaks over his 
balding skull, his eyes as soft and 
wistful as those of an unwanted 
puppy. 

I felt those eyes on me while I 
handed the manifests to one offi- 
cial, the ship’s papers to another. 
They followed as I stepped into 
the Medic’s cubicle for a radia- 
tion check and they were waiting 
for me when I came out to clear 
Customs. 

Soft eyes, patient eyes, eyes 
that stared at everyone who 
landed on the Moon. For every- 
one landing on the Moon had to 
pass through Reception and every- 
one heading for Earth had to ar- 
rive at Tycho. 

Most never gave him a second 
thought. Some, like Dumarest, 
wondered and perhaps built elab- 
orate theories to account for his 
presence. I knew just why he 
stood where he did and stared at 
endless faces with his soft, pa- 
tient eyes. 

He was waiting for his son. 

^r'PRANK.” He stepped for- 
ward as I was about to 
pass him, one thin hand resting on 
my arm, the soft eyes asking the 
eternal question. 

I shook my head. “No luck. 
Sorry.” 

“No passengers? No one else on 



board? Nobody at all, Frank?” 
“Just the three of us.” I looked 
at Dumarest and French as they 
passed us, heading to a hotel, a 
shower, a complete relaxation 
from ship routine. Some crews 
stuck together during leaves, but 
ours wasn’t one of them. I knew 
I wouldn’t see them again, unless 
by accident, until time came for 
takeoff. 

“And no ships due for three 
days.” Thorne let his hand fall 
from my arm. He knew the flight 
schedules as well as the dispatch- 
ers did. “Did you — on Mars, I 
mean?” 

“We landed at Holmston,” I 
said. “We were there two days, 
just long enough to unload and 
take on cargo. I know every man 
and woman in the settlement.” 
“Of course.” He blinked and 
looked abashed. “I just thought 
that maybe . .” 

“Be reasonable,” I said. “Mars 
isn’t like the Sahara. A man can’t 
wander over the deserts for years, 
just like that. He can’t live away 
from the settlements, no food, no 
water, not even enough air.” 
“No, I suppose not.” He moved 
beside me as I walked down the 
passage. I didn’t want his com- 
pany, but I didn’t know how to 
tell him that. I had spoken to him 
first from pity, then from habit, 
now from duty. Always my re- 
ports were the same, but always 
he accepted what I said with the 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




mental reseivatkm that I must be 
wrong. 

I anticipated his next question. 
“Nor on Venus. Conditions there 
are about like Mars. You live in 
a settlement or you don’t live at 
all.” 

“Mercury?” 

“Not a chance.” 

We had reached the end of the 
corridor and the avenues of the 
dome stretched out before us. I 
headed for the official cubicles, 
paid for a key and led the way 
down the passage. The cubicle 
was small, cramped, containing 
only a cot, a chair and a locker. 
It was more like a cell than any- 
thing else, but it was cheap. I 
threw my baggage onto the cot 
and turned to the old man. 

“You’re wasting your time, 
Thome. Why don’t you admit it?” 

“I can’t.” He sat on the chair 
and looked at his hands. “You 
don’t understand — no one does — 
but I’ve got to see Tony again.” 

“Why?” 

“There’s something I want to 
say to him.” 

“That all?” My voice must 
have expressed my feelings, for 
he looked up at me. 

“No,” he said quietly. “That 
isn’t all. He is my son.” 

I T WAS the way he said it 
rather than what he said. It 
was the voice of a dedicated man 
and there could be no arguing

with it. 1 unzipped my bag, took 
out a few toilet articles, a change 
of underwear and some personal 
junk that I carried around, and 
spread the things about the cu- 
bicle. I didn’t look at the old man; 
if he wanted to talk, he would 
talk. I hoped he wouldn’t. 

“Sixteen years,” he said. “It’s a 
long time.” 

“Too long,” I said. “He’s prob- 
ably been dead for years.” 

“No!” The denial was so em- 
phatic, it hurt. 

“Why not?” I was losing pa- 
tience. “Lots of men died in the 
early days. How can you be sure 
that he wasn’t one of them?” 

“I’ve tracked down the record 
of every man who died off Earth.” 
He smiled at my expression. “It 
took money, Frank, but I’m not 
poor and I’d spend every penny I , 
owned if I could just see my boy 
once more.” 

I didn’t say anything. There 
was nothing I could say, but I 
wished the old man would get up 
and leave me. He didn’t; instead, 
he told me all about it. I wished 
he hadn’t. 

Tony Thorne was young, wild, 
with a dream in his heart and 
starlight in his eyes. His mother 
was dead; his father refused to 
give him up and so denied him 
permission to enlist in Space 
School. So young Tony had stolen 
all the money he could lay his 
hands on and had run away from 

63 




home; A simple, sordid, sixteea- 
year-old story. Nothing unique 
about it in the slightest — noth- 
ing, that is, aside from the sequel. 

“I want to forgive him,” said 
the old man. “I’ve tried to forget 
him, but I can’t. I keep thinking 
of him somewhere out in space or 
on one of the planets. Married, 
perhaps, and with children of his 
own — my grandchildren. I want 
to find him and tell him that I un- 
derstand and forgive.” He looked 
at me with those soft, patient 
eyes. “Can you understand?” 

“I can understand how you 
feel,” I said carefully. “But can 
you understand how he might 
feel? He ran away from home six- 
teen years ago and has never 
written. Have you thought that 
maybe he doesn’t want to see 
you?” 

“He could be afraid. That might 
be it. I was pretty hard in the old 
days.” 

“Sixteen years is a long time,” 
I insisted. “A man can forget a lot 
during that time.” 

“But not his father.” 

“You’re the man who turned 
him into a criminal because you 
wanted your own way. Now, be- 
cause age has made you sentimen- 
tal, you want to find him and tell 
him how sorry you are that it all 
happened. You know what I 
think? I think you’re plain 
damned selfish.” 

“Maybe I am,” he said slowly. 



‘1 giiess all eld parepts are.” He 
studied me. “How old are you, 
Frank?” 

“Thirty-three. Why?” 

“Tony would be that age on his 
next birthday.” He had already 
forgotten most of what I had said. 
“He would look a lot like you — 
same hair, same eyes.” 

¥T£ sighed and shook his head. 
A A “I suppose you never met 
him while at school?” 

“No.” 

“Are you sure? He was big for 
his age, good at athletics. He had 
dark hair and when he smiled, it 
was like the Sun breaking through 
clouds.” 

“What do you think the early 
days were like, Thorne?” I forced 
him to meet my eyes. “The Gov- 
ernment schools were fine, sure, 
but what about the kids who 
couldn’t get in and had to buy 
their way into space? They 
learned or they died. Those dajrs 
are over now and everything is 
nicely regulated and safe, but it 
was hell while it lasted. You think 
your son will thank you for some- 
thing like that?” 

“It was his own choosing,” 
Thorne said. 

“No, it was what you forced 
him to do.” I drew a deep breath. 
“Anyway, you can’t even be sure 
that he ever went into space.” 
“He went into space,” said the 
old man. “That was why he stole 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




the money, to, bribe his way into 
Space School. Tm sure of that.” 

“And that’s why you stand in 
Reception watching everyone who 
lands?” 

He made a helpless gesture. 
“It’s all I can do. I’m too old to go 
on the search myself; the Medics 
wouldn’t pass me. Tony may have 
changed his name, anjrthing, and 
no one would know. But one day 
he’ll come back home. When he 
does. I’ll be waiting.” 

“You’re crazy.” I stood up and 
walked the two paces to the end 
of the cubicle. I gazed at the 
wall, smooth metal, then turned to 
face the old man. “Crazy! Do you 
hear? You’ve stood there for how 
long? Two years? Three? And 
still he hasn’t come. Why don’t 
you go home?” 

“I’m here to stay. My heart 
wouldn’t stand the trip.” He rose 
to his feet, very old, very pa- 
thetic, and reached for the door. 

“So you’re here until you die, 
is that it?” 

“Yes, Frank,” he said quietly. 
“That’s about it.” 

“And you’re going to stand 
there in Reception and stare at 
everyone landing on the Moon. 
You’re going to do that year after 
year so that, every time I land, 
you’ll be waiting. Right?” 

“Yes,” he said again. “That’s 
right.” 

“Get out,” I said. “Get out and 
leave me alone.”

cubicte seenaed more like 
a cell than ever after he had 
gone. I sat down for a while, then, 
collecting my toilet things, went 
down the passage to the com- 
munal washroom. I showered, 
shaved and did all the things 
which are supposed to make a 
man feel fresh and glad to be 
alive, but for me they were just 
wasting time. 

Returning to the cubicle, I 
changed into my spare uniform 
and went out. Entertainment on 
the Moon consisted mostly of in- 
door sports, though an enterpris- 
ing firm offered mountaineering 
and dust-skiing, neither of which 
interested me in the slightest. I 
had a couple of drinks in a bar 
and was finishing the second 
when I saw Dumarest. He glanced 
through the door, saw me, hesi- 
tated and then moved on. I wasn’t 
surprised; Dumarest was a drink- 
ing man and foxmd little enjoy- 
ment in my company. 

On board, where there was no 
alcohol, I could afford to relax. 
In a bar, knowing how liquor 
loosened tongues, I dared be 
nothing but careful. 

I’d had to be careful for six- 
teen years. 

I took two more solitary drinks 
in two different bars and finally, 
feeling the warmth of the liquor 
in my stomach, slipped coins into 
the slot of a tridi and entered the 
darkened theatre.

The movie was a regular heart- 
wringer about a little boy, his dog 
and a white-haired old mother. 
The plot was nothing, the scenery 
everything, and I sniffed the scent 
of pines and heard the thin whis- 
per of wind through the trees, saw 
the stately movement of fleecy 
clouds and even felt the sprayed 
moisture of S3mthetic rain on my 
face and hands. 

For a while, I was back on 
Earth, among the green, growing 
things of the planet where I had 
been born. The planet I hadn’t 
visited for almost half my life. 

The tridi turned sour. The eyes 
of the dog reminded me of the 
eyes of Thorne. The white-haired 
old mother reminded me of the si- 
lent, watchful, ever-hoping man 
who stood in Reception. The kid, 
with his dark hair and the smile 
like the Sun breaking through the 
clouds, made me remember things 
best left forgotten. 

Back in the cubicle, I sat on 
the cot and stared at the metal 
walls. 

The likeness to a jail cell was 
unintentional, but it was there. 
The only difference between the 
room in which I sat and an actual 
cell was that I could, at any time, 
open the door and leave. 

Leave to enter another cell, the 
cell of a spaceship bound for the 
planets, a metal egg which held a 



man more securely than any 
prison. 

T SHOOK my head and glared 
into the mirror facing the 
locker. It was a full-length mirror 
and it gave a good view. I glow- 
ered at the man reflected there, 
the seamed face, the graying hair, 
the haimted eyes. The eyes which 
held a secret that had to be kept. 

Some men can commit a crime 
and forget it. Others, forced into 
crime for the sake of an ideal, 
punish themselves all their lives. 
Before Thome had come, it had 
been bad, but now it was getting 
unbearable. Every time I landed, 
I could feel those soft, patient 
eyes and know that I and I alone 
could end his vigil. And he would 
stay there all his life, watching, 
watching, meeting me at the end 
of every trip. And, on the Moon, 
men live a long, long time. 

Cursing did no good, but I 
cursed all the same. Cursing the 
accident of chance which had 
thrown me, a space-mad young- 
ster, into the company of a nm- 
away kid with the same dream — 
but with the money to turn that 
dream into reality. Cursing the 
rock, the thin skull, the blood- 
money which had bought me six- 
teen years of helL 

And his father’s watching eyes.

Frank. J. B. Lippincott., Phila.

T TNDOUBTEDLY a good many 
^ of you remember Frank’s 
slapsticky Mr. Adam of a few 
years back. Well, relax ... or 
rather, prepare to tense up, be- 
cause his current book is as dif- 
ferent as Dracula and Joe Miller. 

It is a murder story — not a 
mystery, because we are informed 
of identities at the outset. Also, 
it is a true horror yarn because 
the victim is sufficiently power- 
ful to thwart any attempt, but 



remains uncomprehendingly inert 
while the murderous plans un- 
fold. 

Who is the victim? The U.S.A. 

Like last month’s Two Rabies 
to Times Square, the author en- 
visions a Soviet school turning 
out completely Americanized 
agents. Four of them are landed 
on the Florida coast to infiltrate 
into the Strategic Air Command 
and sabotage the newest long- 
range bombers into being ground- 
ed. Once this happens, of course, 
the U.S. cannot retaliate against 
attack with any strength.

TN many yams, from E. E. 

Smith’s Skylark on, authors 
have circumvented communica- 
tion problems by means of trick 
gadgets that take in alien lingoes 
and turn out English. We ac- 
cepted it for the sake of story 
continuity, but it always took a 
strong swallow. The real surprise, 
though, is that there is consider- 
able progress already in adapting 
electronic brains to the problem! 

A fascinating subject, indeed, 
but the series of essays in this

1999 OUR HOPEFUL FUTURE 
by Victor Cohn. The Bobbs- 
Merrill Co., Inc., Indianapolis & 
N. Y. $3.75 

W HAT a difference when a 
professional takes over from 
amateurs! 

Last month, we had a stagger- 
ingly impressive list of prognosti- 
cators writing in The Fabulous 



Future. Of course, they only went 
as far as 1980, but it’s almost 
certain that we’ll hit the limits 
of their vision long before then. 

Cohn, however, opens a vista 
that looks like a reckless pipe 
dream — and proceeds to show 
how all this is either already in 
the labs or on the drawing board. 
And far from producing a dry 
essay, Cohn has interjected fas- 
cinating glimpses into the daily 
routine of Mr. Future before 
each chapter. 

THE BRIGHT PHOENIX by 
Harold Mead. Ballantine Books,

NGLAND bequeathed us such 

gems as Huxley’s Brave New 
World and Orwell’s 1984. Mead 
follows in their footsteps with 
a powerful story reminiscent of 
both yarns, but strongly individ- 
ualistic in his treatment of a regi- 
mented future society. 

The period is unspecified, but 
mankind has fought its way back 
from barbarism after a war to 
the point where it requires le- 
bensraum once again. An explorer 
has been sent to The Island to 
report on colonization possibili- 
ties. A new race of perfect physi- 
cal specimens has been bred for 
this specific purpose. His report 
is favorable and colonization pro- 
ceeds. 

However, his prolonged absence

from civilization has so warped 
his outlook on the holiness of 
the state that he is a ripe subject 
for reconditioning. The conflict 
between the Reconditioneds, the 
Colonists and the Islanders is 
presented with a savage power 
that is unusual in a first novel. 

ATLANTIS - THE MYSTERY 
UNRAVELLED by Jtirgen 
Spanuth. The Citadel Press, N. Y. 
$4.00 

T HOPE Willy Ley takes this 
volume under advisement to 
pass on the historical merits of its 
argument, for the basic premise 
is a gripping one and its logic 
is too convincing for anybody but 
an expert to assess. 

Spanuth puts forth the star- 
tling theory that Atlantis is not 
to be found in the various places 
previously assumed, but in the 
North Sea off Schleswig-Holstein, 
near Heligoland. He bases this 
on Plato’s Dialogues and certain 
inscriptions on the walls of the 
temple of Medinet Habu, erected 
by Ramses III to celebrate his 
victory over the North people. 
They are depicted with horned 
helmets and are described as ex- 
cellent seamen. 

He reasons further that there 
is an enormous chronological 
error in the dating of the Atlantis 
catastrophe — the computation 
was made in years, whereas, even 

70 



today, the Egs^ptians reckon in 
months. The error, then, lay in 
considering Atlantis as falling in 
12,000 B.C. instead of 1,200 B.C. 

Worldwide cataclysms swept 
the Earth at that time and the 
Atlanteans were forced from their 
inundated home. Far from being 
disorganized, however, they were 
superbly equipped and had a 
navy of 1200 vessels. They swept 
over Europe in their march to 
the Egyptian border, being re- 
pulsed only by the ancient Athe- 
neans until their utter defeat by 
the Egyptians. 

True or not, the presentation 
of Spanuth’s theory reads like 
authentic history.

MAN UNDER THE SEA by 
James Dugan. Harper & Bros., 
N. Y., $5.00 

MAN AND THE UNDER- 
WATER WORLD by Pierre de 
Latil and Jean Rivoire. G. P. 
Putnam’s Sons, N. Y. $5.00 

A T the time that Man is mak- 
ing his greatest progress in 
piercing the space frontier, he 
has also made tremendous strides 
in expanding his knowledge of a 
much closer barrier, the sea. This 
is evidenced by the number of 
books on the subject flooding 
the market. 

It almost appears as if the 
authors of these two books agreed 
to divide up spheres of influence. 
In spite of the considerable length 
of both books, there is very little 
overlap in coverage of events. 
Both contain fascinating accounts 
of Man’s age-long efforts to under- 
stand and conquer the cruel ele- 
ment. 

The French book is written 
more from the vantage-point of 
the naturalist, whereas Dugan has 
devoted himself more to the ma- 
terial aspects of Man’s interest 
in the sea, delineating the prog- 
ress in diving appurtenances 
from antiquity to the present and 
their use in salvage. 

De Latil and Rivoire, how- 
ever, have had intimate contact 
with the pioneers of the skin- 
diving technique and have drawn 



some fine word-pictures of this 
habit-forming new sport that may 
have you hocking the family 
jewels for an Aqualung all your 
own. 

Both volumes are copiously 
illustrated and will dress up your 
non-fiction shelf.

$3.00 

T IKE Jurgen Spanuth else- 
where in this column, Girvan 
makes a strong case for his spe- 
cialty. In case you didn’t know, 
he is the British publisher of 
Heard’s Riddle of the Flying 
Saucers and Adamski’s Flying 
Saucers Have Landed. And, as 
you’d expect, he has had access to 
more interplanetary platter re- 
ports than you can shake a head 
at. 

He states that, at the outset of 
the saucer controversy, he was 
infected with the will-not-to-be- 
lieve until testimony became so 
overwhelming that he lost his 
resistance. He stresses the point 
that he himself has not been a 
witness of a visitation, but that 
the plethora of accounts by un- 
impeachable witnesses has re- 
sulted in a will-to-believe. Under- 
standable— but the title’s promise 
of common sense is not fulfilled.

DOUBLi DARE 

By ROBERT SILVERBERG 

Pride leadeth to worse than a 
fall ... It sticketh men out on 
a limb and keepeth them there! 



B y the time the space- 
ship had finished jiggling 
and actually stood firmly 
on Domerangi soil, Justin Mamer 
was beginning to doubt his sanity. 

“We must be crazy,” he said. 
“We must be.” 

The other Earthman, who had 
been gazing out the viewplate at 
the green-and-gold alien vista, 
glanced around suddenly at Mar- 
ner’s remark. “Huh?” 

“There are limits to which one 



goes in proving a point,” Marner 
said. He indicated the scene out- 
side. “This little journey exceeds 
the limits. Now that we’re here, 
Kemridge, I’m sure of it. Nobody 
does things like this.” 

Kemridge shrugged sourly. 
“Don’t be silly, Justin. You know 
why we’re here, and you know 
how come we’re here. This isn’t 
any time to — ” 

“All right,” Marner said. “I take 
it all back.” He stared for a mo-

ment at his delicate, tapering fin- 
gers — the fingers that could have 
belonged to a surgeon, were they 
not the property of a top-rank 
technical engineer. “Don’t pay 
any attention to whatever I just 
said. It’s the strain that’s getting 
me.” 

The door of the cabin chimed 
melodiously. 

“Come in,” said Kemridge. 

T he door slid open and a Do- 
merangi, clad in a bright yel- 
low sash, gray-green buskins and 
a glittering diadem of precious 
gems, stepped heavily into the 
cabin. He extended two of his five 
leathery tentacles in welcome. 

“Hello, gentlemen. I see you’ve 
come through the trip in fine 
shape.” 

“What’s going on now, Plor- 
vash?” Marner asked. 

“The ship has landed at a 
spaceport just outside the city,” 
the alien said. “I’ve come to take 
you to your quarters. We’re giv- 
ing you two the finest accommo- 
dations our planet can offer. We 
want your working conditions to 
be of the best.” 

“Glad to hear it.” Marner flicked 
a glance at his companion. 
“They’re most considerate, aren’t 
they, Dave?” 

The taller of the two Earthmen 
nodded gravely. “Definitely.” 
Plorvash grinned. “Suppose 
you come with me now. You 



would like to be well rested be- 
fore you undertake your task. Af- 
ter all, you should be at your 
best, since planetary pride is at 
stake.” 

“Of course,” Marner said. 

“The test will begin as soon as 
you wish. May I offer you good 
luck?” 

“We won’t need it,” Kemridge 
stated grimly. “It’s not a matter 
of luck at all. It’s brains — brains 
and sweat.” 

“Very well,” Plorvash said. 
“This is what you’re here to 
prove. It ought to be amusing, in 
any case — whatever the outcome 
may be.” 

Both Earthmen tried to look 
calm and confident, absolutely 
sure of themselves and their skill. 

They merely managed to look 
rigidly worried. 

STATISTICIANS have no rec- 
ords on the subject, but it is 
an observed phenomenon that the 
most serious differences of opin- 
ion generally originate in bars. It 
had been in a bar at Forty-sixth 
and Sixth that Justin Marner had 
ill-advisedly had words with a 
visiting Domerangi, a month be- 
fore, and it had been in the same 
bar that the train of events which 
had brought the two Earthmen to 
Domerang V had started — and 
never stopped gaining momentum. 

It had been a simple alterca- 
tion at first. Marner had been re- 



DOUBLE DARE 



73 




flectively sipping a whiskey sour, 
and Kemridge, seated to his left 
with his long legs tincomfortably 
scrunched up, had been toying 
with a double scotch. The Dome- 
rangi had entered the bar with a 
characteristically ponderous 
stride. 

Though contact with Domerang 
V had been made more than a 
century before, Domerangi were 
still rare sights in New York. 
Marner and Kemridge knew this 
one, though — he was attached to 
the Domerangi Consulate on Six- 
ty-sixth and Third, and they had 
had dealings with him a year ago 
in the matter of some circuit 
alignments for the building’s light- 
ing system. Domerangi, with their 
extraordinary peripheral vision, 
prefer subdued, indirect lighting, 
and Marner and Kemridge had 
designed the lighting plot for the 
Consulate. 

The Domerangi spotted them 
immediately and eased his bulk 
onto the stool next to them. “Ah, 
the two clever engineers,” the 
alien rumbled. “You remember 
me, of course?” 

“Yes,” Marner said quickly. 
“How’s the lighting job working 
out?” 

“As well as could be expected.” 
The Domerangi waved toward 
the bartender. “Barkeep! Two 
beers, please.” 

“What do you mean by that?” 
Kemridge demanded as the beers 



were drawn arid set on the bar. 

“Just one moment, please.” The 
alien curled two tentacles gently 
around the beers and poured one 
into each of the two feeding- 
mouths at the sides of his face. 
“Marvelous liquid, yoiu’ beer. The 
one point where Earth is clearly 
superior to Domerang is in brew- 
ing.” 

“To get back to the lights—” 
Kemridge prodded. 

“Oh, yes,” the alien said. “The 
lights. Well, they’re a pretty fair 
job — as good as we could have 
hoped for, from a second-rate 
technology.” 

“Now hold on a minute!” Mar- 
ner said hotly, and that was how 
it started. 

f f I WISH we’d kept our mouths 
* shut,” Marner said glumly. 
He stared balefully at the spotless 
ceiling of the hotel room in which 
the Domerangi had installed 
them. 

Kemridge whirled and glared 
down at the smaller man. “Listen, 
Justin: we’re here and we’re go- 
ing to show them up and go home 
rich and famous. Got that?” 
“Okay,” Marner said. He ran 
a finger along his thin lower lip. 
“I’m sorry I keep popping off like 
this. But it does seem screwy to 
have gone to this extent just to 
prove a point that came up in a 
barroom debate.” 

“I know. But we wouldn’t have 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




come here if the State Depart- 
ment hadn’t heard about the argu- 
ment and thought it needed set- 
tling. The Domerangi have been 
acting lordly about their tech- 
nology as long as we’ve known 
them. I think it’s a great idea to 
send a couple of honest-to-Christ- 
mas Terran engineers up here to 
show them once and for all who’s 
got what it takes.” 

“But suppose we don’t show 
them?” 

“We will! Between the two of 
us, we can match anything they 
throw at us. Can’t we?” 

Marner smiled gloomily. “Sure 
we can,” he said without convic- 
tion. “I haven’t doubted it for one 
minute.” 

Kemridge walked to the door 
and, with a swift searching mo- 
tion of his fingers, foimd the plate 
that covered the door mechanism. 
He imclipped it. 

“Look in here, for example,” he 
said, after a moment’s scrutiny. 
“Simple cybernetic mechanism. I 
don’t quite figure the way this 
green ceramic relay down here 
controls the power flow, but it’s 
nothing we couldn’t dope out, 
given a screwdriver and a little 
spare time.” 

Marner stood on tip-toes and 
peered in. “Perfectly understand- 
able gadget,” he commented. “Not 
nearly as efficient as our kind, 
either.” 

“That’s just the point,” Kem- 



ridge said. “These Domerangi 
aren’t half the sharks they think 
they are. We stipulated that we 
could duplicate an3dhing they 
gave us, right? With our natural 
savvy and a little perspiration, we 
ought to be able to match the best 
gadget they test us with. If we 
follow through up here and those 
two Domerangi engineers on 
Earth mess up their half of the 
test, then we’ve done it. The State 
Department’s counting on our 
versatility. That’s all we need, 
Justin — cleverness!” 

Marner’s eyes lit up. “Dave, 
I’m sorry I was so pig-headed a 
minute ago. We’ll give them the 
business, all right!” 

He stood up a little higher and 
gingerly extended a hand into the 
gaping servomechanism in the 
wall. 

“What are you doing?” Kem- 
ridge asked. 

“Never mind. Get on the phone 
and tell Plorvash that we’ll be 
ready to get to work tomorrow. 
While you’re doing that, I want to 
fool with this relay. Might as well 
get some practice now!” He was 
radiant with new-found enthusi- 
asm. 

W HEN Plorvash knocked on 
the door the following morn- 
ing, the mood was still on them. 
They were clear-eyed, wide awake 
and firmly convinced they could 
master any problem. 



DOUBLE DARE

“Who’s there?” Mamer asked 
loudly. 

“Me,” the Domerangi said. 
“Plorvash.” 

Instantly the door flew open 
and the dumfounded alien 
charge-d’affaires was confronted 
with the sight of the two Earth- 
men still snug in their beds. He 
peered behind the door and in 
the closet. 

“Who opened the door?” he 
asked suspiciously. 

Marner sat up in bed and 
grinned. “Try it again. Go out- 
side and call out ‘Plorvash’ the 
way you just did.” 

The alien lumbered out, pull- 
ing the door shut behind him. 
When he was outside, he said his 
name again and the door opened 
immediately. He thundered across 
the threshold and looked from 
Marner to Kemridge. “What did 
you do?” 

“We were experimenting with 
the door-opener last night,” Kem- 
ridge said. “And before we put it 
back together, we decided it 
might be fun to rig up a modified 
vocoder circuit that would open 
the door automatically at the 
sound of the syllables ‘Plorvash’ 
directed at it from outside. It 
works very nicely.” 

The alien scowled. “Ah — yes. 
Very clever. Now as to the terms 
of this test you two are to engage 
in: we’ve prepared a fully 

equipped laboratory for you in 

DOUBLE DARE 



Central Sqorvik — that’s a suburb 
not far from here — and we’ve set 
up two preliminary problems for 
you, as agreed. When you’ve dealt 
with those — if you’ve dealt with 
those — we’ll give you a third.” 
“And if we don’t deal with 
them successfully?” 

“Why, then you’ll have failed 
to demonstrate your ability.” 
“Reasonable enough,” Marner 
said. “But just when do we win 
this thing? Do you go on giving 
us projects till we miss?” 

“That would be the ultimate 
proof of your ability, wouldn’t it?” 
Plorvash asked. “But you’ll be 
relieved to know that we have no 
such plans. According to the terms 
of the agreement between our- 
selves and your government, the 
test-groups on each planet will be 
required to carry out no more 
than three projects.” The alien’s 
two mouths smiled unpleasantly. 
“We’ll consider successful comple- 
tion of all three projects as ample 
proof of your ability.” 

“I don’t like the way you say 
that,” Kemridge objected. “What’s 
up your sleeve?” 

“My sleeve? I don’t believe I 
grasp the idiom,” Plorvash said. 

“Never mind. Just a Terran 
expression,” said Kemridge. 

A CAR was waiting for them 
outside the hotel — a long, 
low job with a pulsating flexible 
hood that undulated in a distress- 

77 




ing fashion, like a monstrous 
metal artery. 

Plorvash slid the back door 
open. “Get in. I’ll take you to the 
lab to get started.” 

Mamer looked at the alien, 
then at Kemridge. Kemridge 
nodded. “How about one for the 
road?” Mamer suggested. 

“Eh?” 

“Another idiom,” he said. “I 
mean a drink. Alcoholic beverage. 
Stimulant of some kind. You 
catch?” 

The alien grinned nastily. “I 
understand. There’s a dispensary 
on the next street. We don’t want 
to rush you on this thing, any- 
way.” He pointed to the moving 
roadway. “Get aboard and we’ll 
take a quick one.” 

They followed the Domerangi 
onto the moving strip and a mo- 
ment later found themselves in 
front of a domed structure planted 
just off the roadway. 

“It doesn’t look very cozy,” 
Kemridge commented as they en- 
tered. A pungent odor of ether hit 
their nostrils. Half a dozen Do- 
merangi were l3nng on the floor, 
holding jointed metal tubes. As 
they watched, Plorvash clam- 
bered down and sprawled out on 
his back. 

“Come, join me,” he urged. 
“Have a drink.” He reached for 
a tube that slithered across the 
floor toward him and fitted it into 
his left feeding mouth. 

78 



“This is a bar?” Kemridge 
asked unhappily. “It looks more 
like the emergency ward of a hos- 
pital.” 

Plorvash finished drinking and 
stood up, wiping a few drops of 
green liquid from his jaw. “Good,” 
he said. “It’s not beer, but it’s 
good stuff. I thought you two 
wanted to drink.” 

Mamer sniffed the ether-laden 
air in dismay and shook his head. 
“We’re not — thirsty. It takes time 
to get used to alien customs, I 
suppose.” 

“I suppose so,” Plorvash agreed. 
“Very well, then. Let’s go to the 
lab, shall we?” 

^I’HE laboratory was, indeed, a 
sumptuous place. The two 
Earthmen stood at the entrance to 
the monstrous room and mar- 
veled visibly. 

‘We’re impressed,” Mamer 
said finally to the Domerangi. 

“We want to give you every op- 
portunity to succeed,” Plorvash 
said. “This is just as important 
for us as it is for you.” 

Mamer took two or three steps 
into the lab and glanced around. 
To the left, an enormous oscillo- 
scope wiggled greenly at him. The 
right-hand wall was bristling with 
elaborate servomechanisms of all 
descriptions. The far wall was a 
gigantic toolchest and work- 
benches were spotted here and 
there. The lighting — indirect, of 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




course— was bright and eye-eas- 
ing. It was the sort of research 
setup a sane engineer rarely both- 
ers even to dream of. 

“You’re making it too easy for 
us,” said Kemridge. “It can’t be 
hard to pull off miracles in a lab 
like this.” 

“We are honest people. If you 
can meet our tests, we’ll grant 
that you’re better than we are. It 
you can, that is. If you fail, it 
can’t be blamed on poor working 
conditions.” 

“Fair enough,” Kemridge 
agreed. “When are you ready to 
start?” 

“Immediately.” Plorvash 
reached into the bagging folds of 
his sash and withdrew a small 
plastic bubble, about four inches 
long, containing a creamy-white 
fluid. 

“This is a depilator,” he said. 
He squeezed a few drops out of 
the bubble into the spoonlike end 
of one tentacle and rubbed the 
liquid over the thick, heavy red 
beard that sprouted on his lower 
jaw. A streak of beard came away 
as he rubbed. “It is very useful.” 
He handed the bubble to Mamer. 
“Duplicate it.” 

“But we’re engineers, not chem- 
ists,” Mamer protested. 

“Never mind, Justin.” Kem- 
ridge turned to the alien. “That’s 
the first problem. Suppose you 
give us the second one at the 
same time, just to make things 

DOUBLE DARE 



.more convenient. That way, we’ll 
each have one to work on.” 

T>LORVASH frowned. “You 
want to work on two projects 
at once? All right.” He turned, 
strode out and returned a few mo- 
ments later, carrying something 
that looked like a large mousetrap 
inside a cage. He handed it to 
Kemridge. 

“We use this to catch small 
house pests,” Plorvash explained. 
“It’s a self-baiting trap. Most of 
our house pests are color-sensi- 
tive and this trap flashes colors as 
a lure. For example, it does this 
to trap vorks— ” he depressed a 
lever in the back and the trap 
glowed a lambent green — “and 
this to catch flaibs.” Another lever 
went down and the trap radiated 
warm purple. An unmistakable 
odor of rotting vegetation ema- 
nated from it as well. 

“It is, as you see, most versa- 
tile,” the alien went on. “We’ve 
supplied you with an ample num- 
ber of vermin of different sorts — 
they’re at the back of the lab, in 
those cages — and you ought to be 
able to rig a trap to duplicate this 
one. At least, I hope you can.” 

“Is this all?” Kemridge asked. 
Plorvash nodded. “You can 
have all the time you need. That 
was the agreement.” 

“Exactly,” Kemridge said. 
‘We’ll let you know when we’ve 
gotten somewhere.” 



79 




said Plorvash. 

After he had left, Mamer 
squeezed a couple of drops of the 
depilatory out onto the palm of 
his hand. It stung and he imme- 
diately shook it off. 

“Better not fool with that till 
we’ve run an analysis,” Kemridge 
suggested. “If it’s potent enough 
to remove Domerangi beards, it’ll 
probably be a good skin-dissolver 
for Earthmen. Those babies have 
tough hides.” 

Mamer rubbed his hand clean 
hastily. “What do you think of the 
deal in general?” 

“Pretty soft,” Kemridge said. 
“It shouldn’t take more than a 
week to knock off both these 
things, barring complications. 
Seems to me they could pick 
tougher projects than these.” 
“Wait till the final one,” warned 
Mamer. “These are just warm- 
ups.” 

I^OUR DAYS later, Mamer 
called Plorvash from the lab. 
The alien’s bulky form filled 
the screen. “Hello,” he said 
mildly. ‘What’s new?” 

‘We’ve finished the job,” Mar- 
ner reported. 

“Both of them?” 

“Naturally.” 

“I’ll be right over.” 

Plorvash strode into the lab 
about fifteen minutes later, and 
the two Earthmen, who were busy 
with the animal-cages at the back 

ao 



of the lab, waved in greeting. 

“Stay where you are,” Kem- 
ridge called loudly. He reached 
up, pressed a switch, and thirty 
cages clanged open at once. 

As a horde of Domerangi ver- 
min came bounding, slithering, 
crawling and rolling across the 
floor toward Plorvash, the alien 
leaped back in dismay. “What 
kind of trick is this?” 

“Don’t worry,” Mamer said, 
from the remotest comer of the 
lab. “It’ll all be over in a second.” 
The animals ignored Plorvash 
and, to his surprise, they made a 
bee-line for a complex, humming 
arrangement of gears and levers 
behind the door. As they ap- 
proached, it began flashing a se- 
ries of colors, emanating strange 
odors and making cvirious click- 
ing noises. When the horde drew 
closer, jointed arms suddenly 
sprang out and scooped them 
wholesale into a hopper that 
gaped open at floor level. Within 
a moment, they were all stowed 
away inside. 

Mamer came across the lab, 
followed by Kemridge. “We’ve 
improved on your model,” he said. 
“We’ve built a better trap. YOur 
version can deal with only one 
species at a time.” 

Plorvash gulped resoundingly. 
“Very nice. Quite remarkable, in 
fact.” 

“We have the schematics in our 
room,” said Kemridge. “The trap 

6AIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




may have some commercial value 
on Domerang.” 

“Probably,” Plorvash admitted. 
“Mow’d you do on the depilator?” 
“That was easy,” Marner said. 
“With the setup you gave us, 
chemical analysis was a snap. 
Only I’m afraid we’ve improved 
on the original model there, too.” 
“What do you mean?” 

Marner rubbed the side of his 
face uneasily. “I tried our stuff on 
myself, couple of days ago, and 
my face is still smooth as a 
baby’s. The effect seems to be 
permanent.” 

“You’ll submit samples, of 
course,” Plorvash said. “But I 
think it’s fairly safe to assume 
that you’ve passed through the 
first two projects — ah — reason- 
ably well. Curiously, your coun- 
terparts on Earth also did well on 
their preliminaries, according to 
our Consul in New York.” 

“Glad to hear it,” Marner lied. 
“But the third problem tells the 
tale, doesn’t it?” 

“Exactly,” said Plorvash. “Let’s 
have that one now, shall we?” 

A FEW minutes later, Marner 
and Kemridge found them- 
selves staring down at a compli- 
cated nest of glittering relays and 
tubes which seemed to p>ower an 
arrangement of pistons and rods. 
Plorvash had carried it in with 
the utmost delicacy and had 
placed it on a workbench in the 

i;OOUBlEOARE 



middle of the vast laboratory. 
“What is it?” Marner asked. 
“You’ll see,” promised the 
alien. He fumbled in the back of 
the machine, drew forth a cord 
and plugged it into a wall socket. 
A small tube in the heart of the 
machine glowed cherry red and 
the pistons began to move, first 
slowly, then more rapidly. After a 
while, it was humming away at an 
even, steady clip, pistons barrel- 
ing back and forth in purposeless 
but inexorable motion. 

Kemridge bent and peered as 
close to the workings of the 
gadget as he dared. “It’s an en- 
gine. What of it?” 

“It’s a very special kind of en- 
gine,” Plorvash said. “Suppose you 
take the plug out.” 

The Earthman worked the plug 
from its socket and looked at the 
machine. Then the plug dropped 
from his limp hand and skittered 
to the floor. 

“It — doesn’t stop going, does 
it?” Kemridge asked quietly. “The 
pistons keep on moving.” 

“This is our power source,” 
Plorvash said smugly. “We use 
them in vehicles and other such 
things. It’s the third problem.” 
“We’ll give it a try,” Marner 
tried to say casually. 

“I’ll be most interested in the 
results,” Plorvash said. “And now 
I must bid you a good day.” 
“Sure,” Marner said weakly. 
“Cheers.” 

81 




They watched the broad- 
beamed alien waddle gravely out 
of the laboratory, waited till the 
door was closed, and glanced at 
the machine. 

It was still moving. 

Marner licked his lips and 
looked pleadingly at Kemridge. 
“Dave, can we build a perpetual- 
motion machine?” 

^I^HE Domerangi machine 
worked just as well plugged 
in or unplugged, once it had 
tapped some power source to be- 
gin with. The pistons threaded 
ceaselessly up and down. The 
basic components of the thing 
seemed simple enough. 

“The first step to take,” Marner 
said, “is to shut the damned thing 
off so we can get a look at its in- 
nards.” 

“How do we do that?” 

“By reversing the power source, 
I suppose. Feed a negative pulse 
through that power input and 
that ought to do it. We’ll have to 
reverse the polarity of the signal.” 

Half an hour’s hard work with 
tools and solder had done that. 
They plugged the scrambled cord 
into the socket and the machine 
coughed twice and subsided. 

“Okay,” Marner said, rubbing 
his hands with an enthusiasm he 
did not feel. “Let’s dig this baby 
apart and find out what makes it 
tick.” He turned and stared mean- 
ingfully at Kemridge. “And let’s 



adopt this as a working credo, 
Dave: inasmuch as the Dome- 
rangi have already built this 
thing, it’s not impossible. Okay?” 
“That seems to be the only 
basis we can approach it on,” 
Kemridge agreed. 

They huddled around the de- 
vice, staring at the workings. 
Marner reached down and pointed 
at a part. “This thing is something 
like a tuned-plate feedback oscil- 
lator,” he observed. “And I’ll bet 
we’ve almost got a thyratron tube 
over here. Their technology’s a 
good approximation of ours. In 
fact, the whole thing’s within our 
grasp, technically.” 

“Hmm. And the result is a 
closed regenerative system with 
positive feedback,” Kemridge said 
dizzily. “Infinite energy, going 
round and round the cycle. If you 
draw off a hundred watts or so — 
well, infinity minus a hundred is 
still infinity!” 

“True enough.” Marner wiped 
a gleaming bead of perspiration 
from his forehead. “Dave, we’re 
going to have to puzzle this thing 
out from scratch. And we don’t 
dare fail.” 

He reached doggedly for a 
screwdriver. “Remember our 
motto. We’ll use our natural 
savvy and a little perspiration, 
and we ought to do it.” 

Three weeks later, they had 
come up with their first trial 
model — which wobbled along for 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




half an hour, then gave up. 

And a month after that, they 
had a machine that didn’t give up. 

TTESITANTLY, they sent for 
Plorvash. 

“There it is,” Marner said, 
pointing to the bizarre thing that 
stood next to the original model. 
Both machines were humming 
blithely, plugs dangling from the 
sockets. 

“It works?” Plorvash whispered, 
paling. 

“It hasn’t stopped yet,” Marner 
said. There were heavy rings un- 
der his eyes and his usually 
plump face was drawn, with the 
skin tight over his cheekbones. It 
had been two months of almost 
constant strain and both Earth- 
men showed it. 

“It works, eh?” Plorvash asked. 
“How.?” 

“A rather complex hyperspace 
function,” Kemridge said. “I don’t 
want to bother explaining it now 
— you’ll find it all in our report — 
but it was quite a stunt in topol- 
ogy. We couldn’t actually dupli- 
cate your model, but we achieved 
the same effect, which fulfills the 
terms of the agreement.” 

“All a matter of response to 
challenge,” said Marner. “We 
didn’t think we could do it until 
we had to — so we did.” 

“I didn’t think you could do it 
either,” Plorvash said hoarsely. 
He walked over and examined the 



machine closely. “It works, you 
say? Honestly, now?” His voice 
was strained. 

“Of course,” Marner said indig- 
nantly. 

“We have just one question.” 
Kemridge pointed to a small 
black rectangular box buried deep 
in a maze of circuitry in the origi- 
nal model. “That thing down 
there — it nearly threw us. We 
couldn’t get it open to examine it 
and so we had to bypass it and 
substitute a new system for it. 
What in blazes is it?” 

Plorvash wheeled solidly 
around to face them. “That,” he 
said in a strangled voice, “is the 
power source. It’s a miniature 
photoelectric amplifier that should 
keep the model running for — oh, 
another two weeks or so. Then 
the jig would have been up.” 

“How’s that?” Marner was 
startled. 

“It’s time to explain something 
to you,” the alien said wearily. 
“We don’t have any perpetual- 
motion machines. You’ve been 
cruelly hoaxed into inventing one 
for us. It’s dastardly, but we 
didn’t really think you were go- 
ing to do it. It took some of our 
best minds to rig up the model we 
gave you, you know.” 

Marner drew up a lab stool and 
sat down limply, white-faced. 
Kemridge remained standing, his 
features blank with disbelief. 

Marner said, “You mean we 



DOUBLE DARE 



83 




invented the thing and you didn’t 
- you — ” 

Plorvash nodded. “I’m just as 
astonished as you are,” he said. 
He reached for a lab stool him- 
self and sat down. It groaned un- 
der his weight. 

Kemridge recovered first. 
“Well,” he said after a moment of 
silence, “now that it’s over, we’ll 
take our machine and go back to 
Earth. This invalidates the con- 
test, of course.” 

“I’m afraid you can’t do that,” 
Plorvash said. “By a statute en- 
acted some seven hundred years 
ago, any research done in a Do- 
merangi government lab is auto- 
matically government property. 
Which means, of course, that 
we’ll have to confiscate your — 
ahem — project.” 

“That’s out of the question!” 
Marner said hotly. 

“And, furthermore, we intend 
to confiscate you, too. We’d like 
you to stay and show us how to 
build our machines.” 

“This is cause for war,” Kem- 
ridge said. “Earth won’t let you 
get away with this — this kidnap- 
ing!” 

“Possibly not. But in view of 
the way things have turned out, 
it’s the sanest thing we can do. 
And I don’t think Earth will go to 
war over you.” 

“We demand to see bur Con- 
sul,” said Marner. 

“Very well,” Plorvash agreed. 



“It’s within your rights, I sup- 
pose.” 

^ I ■’HE Earth Consul was a white- 
haired, sturdy gentleman 
named Culbertson, who arrived 
on the scene later that day. 

“This is very embarrassing for 
all of us,” the Consul said. He 
ran his hands nervously down his 
traditional pin-striped trousers, 
adjusting the crease. 

“You can get us out of it, of 
course,” Marner said. “That ma- 
chine is our property and they 
have no right to keep us prisoners 
here to operate it, do they?” 

“Not by all human laws. But 
the fact remains, unfortunately, 
that according to their laws, they 
have every right to your inven- 
tion. And by the treaty of 2716, 
waiving extraterritorial sover- 
eignty, Earthmen on Domerang 
are subject to Domerangi laws, 
and vice versa.” He spread his 
hands in a gesture of sympathetic 
frustration. 

“You mean we’re stuck here,” 
Marner said bluntly. He shut his 
eyes, remembering the nightmare 
that was the Domerangi equiva- 
lent of a bar, thinking of the mor- 
bid prospect of spending the rest 
of his life on this unappetizing 
planet, all because of some insane 
dare. “Go on, tell us the whole 
truth.” 

The Consul put the palms of 
his hands together delicately. “We 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




intend to make every effort to get 
you off, of course — naturally so, 
since we owe a very great debt to 
you two. You realize that you’ve 
upheld Earth’s pride.” 

“Lot of good it did us,” Mar- 
ner grunted. 

“Nevertheless, , we feel anxious 
to make amends for the whole 
unhappy incident. I can assure 
you that we’ll do everything in 
our power to make your stay here 
as pleasant and as restful as — ” 

“Listen, Culbertson,” Kemridge 
said grimly. “We don’t want a 
vacation here, not even with 
dancing girls twenty-four hours a 
day and soft violins in the back- 
ground. We don’t like it here. We 
want to go home. You people got 
us into this — now get us out.” 

The Consul grew even more 
unhappy-looking. “I wish you 
wouldn’t put it that way. We’ll 
do all we can.” He paused for a 
moment, deep in thought, and 
said, “There’s one factor in the 
case that we haven’t as yet ex- 
plored.” 

“What’s that?” Marner asked 
uneasily. 

“Remember the two Domerangi 
engineers who went to Earth on 
the other leg of this hookup?” 
The Consul glanced around the 
lab. “Is this place wired any- 
where?” 

“We checked,” Kemridge said, 
“and you can speak freely. What 
do they have to do with us?” 



i^ULBERTSON lowered his 
voice. 

“There’s a slim chance for you. 
I’ve been in touch with authorities 
on Earth and they’ve been keep- 
ing me informed of the progress 
of the two Domerangi. You know 
they got through their first two 
projects as easily as you did.” 

The two Earthmen nodded im- 
patiently. 

The old diplomat smiled his 
apologies. “I hate to admit this, 
but it seems the people at the 
Earth end of this deal had much 
the same idea the Domerangi 
did.” 

“Perpetual motion, you mean?” 

“Not quite,” Culbertson said. 
“They rigged up a phony anti- 
gravity machine and told the Do- 
merangi to duplicate it, just as 
was done here. Our psychologies 
must be similar.” 

“And what happened?” Marner 
asked. 

“Nothing, yet,” the Consul said 
sadly. “But they’re still working 
on it, I’m told. If they’re as clever 
as they say they are, they ought 
to hit it sooner or later. You’ll just 
have to be patient and sweat it 
out. We’ll see to it that you’re 
well taken care of in the mean- 
time, of course, and—” 

“I don’t get it. What does that 
have to do with us?” Marner de- 
manded. 

“If they keep at it, they’ll in- 
vent it eventually.” 



DOUBLE DARE 



85 




Marner scowled. “That may 
take years. It may take forever. 
They may never discover a work- 
able anti-grav. Then what about 
us?” 

The Consul looked sympathetic 
and shrugged. 

A curious gleam twinkled in 
Kemridge’s eye. He turned to 
Marner. “Justin, do you know 
anything about tensor applica- 
tions and gravitational fields?” 

“What are you driving at?” 
Marner said. 

“We’ve got an ideal lab setup 
here. And I’m sure those two Do- 
merangi down there wouldn’t 
mind taking the credit for some- 



one else’s anti-grav, if they were 
approached properly. What do 
you think?” 

Marner brightened. “That’s 
right — they must be just as anx- 
ious to get home as we are!” 

“You mean,” said the Consul, 
“you’d build the machine and let 
us smuggle it to Earth so we could 
slip it to the Domerangi and use 
that as a talking-point for a trade 
and — ” 

He stopped, seeing that no one 
was listening to him, and looked 
around. Marner and Kemridge 
were at the far end of the lab, 
scribbling equations feverishly.

FORECAST 

Unbelievable as it seems, we've learned recently that there are 
readers who actually go through only the synopsis and last install- 
ment of serials! If you're one of them and are doing that with Alfred 
Bester's THE STARS MY DESTINATION, you're missing perhaps the 
most superbly realistic treatment of teleportation in all science fic- 
tion-settling for dehydrated recapitulation instead of living, sweating, 
fighting through scenes quivering with masterful tension . and you 
have not met Gully Foyle. Before you get to next month's installment, 
read the previous two and you will see the lethal logic behind Foyle's 
shrewd revenge for being left to die in space: "Millions for nonsense, 
but not one cent for entropy!" 

There will be at least one novelet — THE NATIVE PROBLEM by 
Robert Sheckley, which shows up the statement that there is plenty 
of room in space for every misfit as sheer propaganda. For Danton 
discovers painfully and bewilderedly that there is less room in space 
for misfits than anywhere else! 

And you'|ll want to accompany Willy Ley as he goes TRACKING 
DOWN THE "SEA SERPENT," an exciting hunt that spans the centuries 
and the oceans. Are there such things? Can the reports be believed? 
Sign aboard this expedition, for that is exactly what It sets out to find!

real data. If there are any errors 
herein, they must be blamed on 
his cigar. 

The banana “tree,” he said, is 
actually an herb, the world’s larg- 
est, since the “trunk” consists of 
the concentric leaf bases of the 
big leaves (also the world’s larg- 
est). 

The banana is technically a 
berry (world’s largest? I forgot to 
ask him) and the tiny black 
specks inside are degenerated 
seeds — which means that every 
banana plantation on Earth was 
planted by Man! 

They had to start somewhere, 
didn’t they? Obviously. The edible 
banana is a dead-end hybrid of 
various wild and inedible species. 
(No, that was not what I was 
feeding Baggy.) When a seedy 
diploid and a seedy tetraploid are 
crossed, the edible non-seed trip- 
loid is the result. 

So we know how it was done 
and even where and when — in 
Malaya in early historical times. 

As Ley says, however, the man 
who can trace the 25 or more va- 
rieties of edible bananas back to 
their ancestors may already have 
been born . but he hasn’t done 
the job yet. 

How, I wanted to know, can 
sterile fruit be planted? The an- 
swer is that bits of the banana 
root stalk serve as seed. Each 
bit keeps growing out until, before 



long, a large underground mat of 
roots surroxmds the place where 
the single bit was planted. 

The root stalks produce buds, 
which shoot up as towering plants; 
each plant produces only a single 
bunch of bananas and dies. The 
plant is then cut to the ground, to 
be replaced by another growing 
from a different underground bud. 

Where, I asked, had I gone 
wrong in feeding Baggy? Simple 
— the fruit does not ripen on the 
tree. That’s why wild monkeys 
don’t eat bananas. (Meant to ask 
how it was discovered that ba- 
nanas ripen only off the tree; 
realize answer could not be more 
than guesswork.) 

In retrospect, the whole devel- 
opment of the banana appears too 
complex to have been all acci- 
dent, I objected. Ley was still 
choking, so I may be reporting in- 
correctly, but I think he men- 
tioned the peach and some others 
as having equally mysterious 
(and inedible) ancestors, yet 
were cultivated by our own an- 
cestors, indicating a rule-of-green- 
thumb knowledge of genetics. 

Now I ought to explain the 
title of this editorial and thank 
the inventor. It’s the work of an 
ingenious fan and the entire equa- 
tion reads: BA -j- 2NA = BA- 
NANA. 

Maybe that’s the answer. Great 
truths are always simple.

Stars My Destination 

By ALFRED BESTER 



Part 2 of a 4-Part Serial 



Being passed by while shipwrecked deserved furious vengeance 
— but seeking it thrust Foyle from the absolute cold of space 
to the absolute black of Earth's most notorious cave prison! 



Illustrated by EMSH 



T he history of Gulliver 
Foyle’s drive for vengeance 
begins in the 25th century, 
a fascinating freak century of 
monsters and grotesques, the great 
age of teleportation, which is 
called “jaunting.” Foyle, the last 
living survivor aboard the Pres- 
teign company’s freighter Nomad, 
has been drifting in space, fight- 
ing for survival in the wrecked 
ship tor 170 days. Another 
freighter, SS Vorga, also owned 
by the Presteign company, passes 
close enough to sight Foyle. Un- 
accountably and cruelly, Vorga 
refuses to rescue Foyle and leaves 
him to die. 




THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



Foyle, a common spaceman 
without training or skill, is 
abruptly awakened from brute 
lethargy by his rage and swears 
to revenge himself on Vorga. He 
succeeds in getting the wrecked 
Nomad under way again and is 
picked up by the savages of a 
Sargasso asteroid, a tiny planet 
manufactured of natural rock 
and wreckage salvaged by its in- 
habitants in space. They also sal- 
vage the SS Nomad and incorpo- 
rate the wreck into their asteroid. 

These are the only savages of 
the 25th century, descendants of 
a research team marooned in 
space centuries ago. They call 
themselves the Scientific People 
and go through travesties of sci- 
entific ritual, including tattooing 
of their faces. While Foyle is un- 
conscious, his lace is hideously 
tattooed with designs and the 
name of the ship on which he 
was found. Nomad. He awakens 
to find himself “scientifically” 
mated to a girl of the Sargasso 
asteroid. 

Foyle escapes and is picked up 
by the Inner Planets navy and 
brought back to Earth. He is still 
seething for revenge and prepares 
to seek out and destroy Vorga 
even while he’s recuperating from 
his injuries in an army hospital. 

Robin Wednesbury, a beautiful 
Negro girl who, as a “telesend,” a 
one-way telepath, is teaching the 
hospital head-injury cases how to 

90 



jaunte again, discovers that Foyle 
is malingering. Foyle blackmails 
her into silence and rapes her. 
Robin is too terrified by the huge 
savage man with the tattooed face 
to defend herself. 

Foyle makes a primitive at- 
tempt to blow up SS Vorga in the 
Presteign dry docks in Vancouver 
and is captured by the Presteign 
company guards. The head of the 
giant corporation, Presteign of 
Presteign, hires the formidable 
Saul Dagenham of Dagenham 
Couriers, and Regis Sheffield, 
leading lawyer of Terra, to rip in- 
formation out of Foyle. It is ur- 
gent to discover the whereabouts 
of the wreck of SS Nomad, for 
aboard is Cr 20 millions in bar 
platinum and a mysterious sub- 
stance called PyrE, the secret of 
which only Presteign knows. 

The Inner Planets and the 
Outer Satellites are at war, and 
Captain Peter Y’ang-Yeovil of 
Central Intelligence demands that 
Presteign turn Foyle over to In- 
telligence so that the army can 
salvage Nomad and the PyrE. 
Although Central Intelligence 
does not know what PyrE is, 
Y’ang-Yeovil suspects that it has 
such fantastic powers that it can 
make the difference between win- 
ning and losing the war. Pres- 
teign refuses to give up Foyle or 
any information about PyrE. 

Saul Dagenham applies every 
ingenious form of physical and 

GALAXY S C I E N C E F I C T I O N 




psychological pressure on Foyle 
to obtain information about the 
whereabouts of the wreck of the 
Nomad. Foyle, still possessed by 
his passionate desire for venge- 
ance against Vorga, refuses to 
reveal anything. At last Dagen- 
ham tells Foyle that legal charges 
have been fabricated against him. 
He’ll go to one of the cavern- 
prisons on Terra and stay there 
until he’s willing to talk.

S OUTH of Saint-Girons, near 
the Spanish-French border, is 
the deepest abyss in France, the 
Gouffre Martel. Its caverns twist 
for miles under the Pyrenees. It 
is the most formidable cavern 
hospital on Earth. No patient has 
ifunted out of its pitch darkness, 
for none has ever succeeded in 
learning the jaunte coordinates of 
the black hospital depths. 

Short of prefrontal lobotomy, 
there are only three ways to stop 
a man from jaunting: a blow on 
the head, producing concussion; 
sedation which prevents concen- 
tration; and concealment of 
jaunte coordination. Of the three, 
concealment was the most prac- 
tical. 

The cells that line the winding 
passages of Gouffre Martel are 
cut out of living rock. They are 
never illuminated. Neither are the 
passages. Infra-red lamps flood 



the darkness, visible only to 
guards and attendants wearing 
snooper goggles with specially 
treated lenses. For the patients, 
there is only the black silence of 
Gouffre Martel, broken by the 
distant rush of underground 
waters. 

For Foyle, there were the si- 
lence, the rushing and the hospi- 
tal routine. At eight o'clock (or it 
may have been any hour in this 
timeless abyss), he was awak- 
ened by a bell. He arose and re- 
ceived his morning meal, slotted 
into the cell by pneumatic tube. 
It had to be eaten at once, for the 
china-surrogate of cups and plates 
was timed to dissolve in fifteen 
minutes. At eight-thirty, the cell 
door opened and Foyle and hun- 
dreds of others shuffled blindly 
through the twisting corridors to 
Sanitation. 

Here, still in darkness, they 
were processed like beef in a 
slaughter house— cleansed, shaved, 
irradiated, disinfected, dosed and 
inoculated. Their paper uniforms 
were removed and sent up to the 
shops to be pulped. New uniforms 
were issued. Then they shuffled 
back to their cells, which had 
been automatically scrubbed out 
while they were in Sanitation. 

In his cell, Foyle listened to in- 
terminable therapeutic talks, lec- 
tures, moral and ethical guidance 
for the rest of the morning. Then 
there was silence again, and noth- 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



91 




ing but the rush of distant water 
and the quiet steps of goggled 
guards in the corridors. 

T N THE afternoon came oc- 
* cupational therapy. The TV 
screen in each cell lit up and the 
patient thrust his hands into the 
shadow frame of the screen. He 
saw three-dimensionally and he 
felt the broadcast objects and 
tools. He cut hospital uniforms, 
sewed them, manufactured 
kitchen utensils and prepared 
foods. Although actually he 
touched nothing, his motions were 
transmitted to the shops, where 
the work was accomplished by 
remote control. After one short 
hour of this relief came the dark- 
ness and silence again. 

But every so often, once or 
twice a week (or perhaps once 
or twice a year), came the muf- 
fled thud of a distant explosion. 
The concussions were startling 
enough to distract Foyle from the 
furnace of vengeance that he 
stoked all through the silences. 
He whispered questions to the in- 
visible figures around him in Sani- 
tation. 

“What’s them explosions?” 

“Explosions?” 

“Blowups. Hear ’em a long way 
off, me.” 

“Them’s Blue Jauntes.” 

“What?” 

“Blue Jauntes. Every sometime 
a guy gets fed up with old Jeffrey. 

9i 



Can’t take it no more, him. Jaun- 
tes into the wild blue yonder.” 

“Jesus.” 

“Yep. Don’t know where they 
are, them. Don’t know where 
they’re going. Blue Jaunte into 
the dark . and we hear ’em ex- 
ploding in the mountains. Boom! 
Blue Jaunte.” 

He was appalled, but he could 
understand. The darkness, the si- 
lence, the monotony destroyed 
sense and brought on desperation. 
The loneliness was intolerable. 
The patients buried in Gouffre 
Martel prison hospital looked 
forward eagerly to the morning 
Sanitation period for a chance to 
whisper a word and hear a word. 
But these fragments were not 
enough and desperation came. 
Then there would be another dis- 
tant explosion. 

Sometimes the suffering men 
would turn on each other and a 
savage fight would break out in 
Sanitation. These were instantly 
broken up by the goggled guards, 
and the morning lecture would 
switch on the Moral Fiber record 
preaching the Virtue of Patience. 

Foyle learned the records by 
heart, every word, every click and 
crack in the tapes. He learned to 
loathe the voices of the lecturers; 
the Understanding Baritone, the 
Cheerful Tenor, the Man-to-Man 
Bass. He learned to deafen him- 
self to the therapeutic monotony 
and perform his occupational 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




therapy- mechanically, but he was 
without resources to withstand 
the endless solitary hours. Fury 
was not enough. 

He lost count of days, of meals, 
of sermons. He no longer whis- 
pered in Sanitation. His mind 
came adrift and he began to wan- 
der. He imagined he was back 
aboard Nomad, reliving his fight 
for survival. Then he lost even 
this feeble grasp on illusion and 
began to sink deeper and deeper 
into the pit of catatonia — of 
womb silence, womb darkness 
and womb sleep. 

* I 'HERE were fleeting dreams. 

An angel hummed to him 
once. Another time she sang qui- 
etly. Thrice he heard her speak; 
“Oh, God!” and “God damn!” and 
“Oh! . .” in a heart-rending de- 
scending note. 

He sank into his abyss, listen- 
ing to her. 

“There is a way out,” his angel 
murmured in his ear sweetly, 
comforting. Her voice was soft 
and warm, yet it burned with 
anger. It was the voice of a furi- 
ous angel. “There is a way out.” 

It whispered in his ear from 
nowhere and suddenly, with the 
logic of desperation, it came to 
him that there was a way out of 
Gouffre Martel. He had been a 
fool not to see it before. 

“Yes,” he croaked. “There’s a 
way out.” 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



There was a soft gasp, then a 
soft question: “Who’s there?” 
“Me, is all,” Foyle said. “You 
know me.” 

“Where are you?” 

“Here. Where I always been, 
me. 

“But there’s no one. I’m alone.” 
“Got to thank you for helping 
me.” 

“Hearing voices is bad,” the fu- 
rious angel murmured. “The first 
step off the deep end. I’ve got to 
stop.” 

“You showed me the way out. 
Blue Jaunte, is all.” 

“Blue Jaunte! My God, this 
must be real! You’re talking the 
gutter lingo. You must be real! 
Who are you?” 

“Gully Foyle.” 

“But you’re not in my cell. 
You’re not even near. Men are in 
the north quadrant of Gouffre 
Martel. Women are in the south. 
I’m South-900. Where are you?” 
“North-111.” 

“You’re a quarter of a mile 
away. How can we— Of course! 
It’s the Whisper Line. I always 
thought that was a legend, but 
it’s true. It’s working now.” 
“Here I go, me,” Foyle whis- 
pered. “Blue Jaunte.” 

“Foyle, listen to me. Forget the 
Blue Jaunte. Dont throw this 
away. It’s a miracle.” 

“What’s a miracle?” 

“There’s an acbustical freak in 
Gouffre Martel — they happen in 



93 




underground caves — a freak of 
echoes, passages and whispering 
galleries. Old-timers call it the 
Whisper Line. I never believed 
them. No one ever did, but it’s 
true. We’re talking to each other 
over the Whisper Line. No one 
can hear us but us. We can talk, 
Foyle. We can plan. Maybe we 
can escape.” 

ITER name was Jisbella Mc- 
Queen. She was hot-tem- 
pered, independent, intelligent, 
and she was serving five years of 
“cure” in Gouffre Martel for lar- 
ceny. Jisbella gave Foyle a cheer- 
fully venomous account of her re- 
volt against society. 

“You don’t know what jaunt- 
ing’s done to women, Gully. It’s 
locked us up, sent us back to the 
seraglio.” 

“What’s seraglio, Jiz?” 

“A harem. A place where 
women are kept on ice. After a 
thousand years of civilization, it 
says here, we’re still property. 
Jaunting’s such a danger to our 
virtue, our value, our mint condi- 
tion, that we’re locked up like 
gold plate in a safe. There’s noth- 
ing for us to do . nothing re- 
spectable. No jobs. No careers. 
There’s no getting out, Gully, un- 
less we bust out and smash all 
the rules.” 

“Did you have to?” 

“I had to be independent. 
Gully. I had to live my own life 



and that’s the only way society 
would let me. So I ran away from 
home and turned crook.” And Jiz 
went on to describe the lurid de- 
tails of her revolt: the Temper 
Racket, the Cataract Racket, the 
Honeymoon and Obituary Robs, 
the Badger Jaunte and the Glim 
Drop. 

Foyle told her about Nomad 
and VoT^a, his hatred and his 
plans. He did not tell Jisbella 
about his face or the twenty mil- 
lions in platinum bullion waiting 
out in the asteroids. 

“What happened to Nomad?” 
Jisbella asked. “Was it the way 
that man Dagenham said? Was 
she blasted by an O.S. raider?” 

“I don’t know, me. Can’t re- 
member, Jiz.” 

“The blast probably wiped out 
your memory. Shock. And being 
marooned for six months didn’t 
help. Did you notice anything 
worth salvaging from Nomad?" 

“No,” Foyle said truthfully. 

“Did Dagenham mention any- 
thing?” 

“No,” he lied. 

“Then he must have another 
reason for hounding you into 
Gouffre Martel. There must be 
something else he wants from 
Nomad.” 

“Yeah, Jiz.” 

“But you were a fool, trying to 
blow up Vorga like that. You’re 
like a wild beast trying to punish 
the trap that injured it. Steel 



94 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




isn’t alive. It doesn’t think. You 
can’t punish Vorga.” 

“Don’t know what you mean, 
Jiz. Vorga passed me by.” 

“You punish the brain, Gully, 
not the ship. Find out who was 
aboard Vorga. Find out who gave 
the order to pass you by. Punish 
him.” 

“Yeah. How?” 

“Learn to think. Gully. The 
head that could figure out how to 
get Nomad under way and how to 
put a bomb together ought to be 
able to figure that out. But no 
more bombs; brains instead. Lo- 
cate a member of Vorga’s crew. 
He’ll tell you who was aboard. 
Track them down. Find out who 
gave the order. Then punish him. 
But it’ll take time. Gully — time 
and money. More than you’ve 
got.” 

“I got a whole life, me.” 

’ I ''HEY murmured for hours 
across the Whisper Line, their 
voices sounding small, yet close 
to the ear. There was only one 
particular spot in each cell where 
the other could be heard, which 
was why so much time had passed 
before they discovered the mi- 
racle. But now they made up for 
lost time. And Jisbella educated 
Foyle. 

“If we ever break out of Gouf- 
fre Martel, Gully, it’ll have to be 
together, and I’m not trusting 
myself to an illiterate partner.” 



“Who’s illiterate?” 

“You are,” Jisbella answered 
firmly. “I have to talk gutter a 
you half the time, me.” 

“I can read and write.” 

“And that’s about all — which 
means that outside of brute 
strength, you’ll be useless.” 

“Talk sense, you,” he said an- 
grily. 

“I am talking sense, me. What’s 
the use of the strongest chisel in 
the world if it doesn’t have an 
edge? We’ve got to sharpen your 
wits. Gully. Got to educate you, 
man, is all.” 

He realized she was right. He 
would need training not only for 
the bust-out but for the search 
for Vorga as well. Jisbella was 
the daughter of an architect and 
had received an education. This 
she drilled into Foyle, leavened 
with the cynical experience of five 
years in the underworld. Occa- 
sionally he rebelled against the 
hard work and there would be 
fiercely whispered quarrels, but 
in the end he would apologize and 
submit again. And sometimes Jis- 
bella would tire of teaching and 
then they would ramble on, shar- 
ing dreams in the dark. 

“I think we’re falling in love. 
Gully.” 

“I think so, too, Jiz.” 

“I’m an old hag. Gully. A hun- 
dred and five years old. What 
are you like?” 

“Awful.” 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



95 




“How, awful?” 

“My face.” 

“You make yourself sound ro- 
mantic. Is it one of those exciting 
scars that make a man attrac- 
tive?” 

“No. You’ll see when we meet, 
us. That’s wrong, isn’t it, Jiz? 
Just plain: ‘When we meet.’ Pe- 
riod.” 

“Good boy.” 

“We will meet some day, won’t 
we, Jiz?” 

“Soon, I hope, Gully.” Jisbella’s 
faraway voice became crisp and 
businesslike. “But we’ve got to 
stop hoping and get down to 
work. We have to plan and pre- 
pare." 

"TROM the underworld, Jisbella 
had inherited a mass of in- 
formation about Gouffre Martel. 
No one had ever jaunted out of 
the cavern hospitals, but for dec- 
ades the underworld had been 
collecting and collating informa- 
tion about them. It was from 
this data that Jisbella had formed 
her quick recognition of the 
Whisper Line that joined them. It 
was on the basis of this informa- 
tion that she began to discuss 
escape. 

“We can pull it off. Gully. 
Never doubt that for a minute. 
There must be dozens of loop- 
holes in their security system.” 

“No one’s ever found them be- 
fore.” 

«« 



“No one’s ever worked with a 
partner before. We’ll pool our 
knowledge and we’ll make it.” 

He no longer shambled to Sani- 
tation and back. He felt the cor- 
ridor walls, noted doors, memo- 
rized their texture, counted, 
listened, deduced and reported. He 
made a note of every separate 
step in the Sanitation pens and 
reported them to Jiz. The ques- 
tions he whispered to the men 
around him in the shower and 
scrub rooms had purpose. To- 
gether, Foyle and Jisbella built 
up a picture of the routine of 
Gouffre Martel and its security 
system. 

One morning, on the return 
from Sanitation, he was stopped 
as he was about to step back into 
his cell. 

“Stay in line, Foyle.” 

“This is North-111. I know 
where to get off by now.” 
“Keep going.” 

“But — ” He was terrified. 
“You’re moving me?” 

“Visitor to see you.” 

He was marched up to the end 
of the north corridor where it met 
the three other main corridors 
that formed the huge cross of the 
hospital. In the center of the cross 
were the administration offices, 
maintenance workshops, clinics 
and plants. 

Foyle was thrust into a room 
as dark as his cell. The door was 
shut behind him. He became 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




aware of a faint shimmering out- 
line in the blackness. It was no 
more than the ghost of an image 
with a blurred body and a death’s 
head. Two black discs on the 
skull face were either eye sockets 
or infra-red goggles. 

“Good morning,” said Saul 
Dagenham. 

“You?” Foyle exclaimed. 

“Me. I’ve got five minutes — 
I’m dangerously radioactive, re- 
member? Sit down. Chair behind 
you.” 

Foyle felt for the chair and sat 
down slowly. 

“Enjoying yourself?” Dagen- 
ham inquired. 

“What do you want?” 

ff^HERE’S been a change,” 
Dagenham said dryly. “Last 
time we talked, your dialogue 
consisted entirely of ‘Go to hell.’ ” 

“Go to hell, Dagenham, if it’ll 
make you feel any better.” 

“Your repartee’s improved; 
your speech, too. You’ve changed,” 
Dagenham said. “Changed a 
damned sight too much and a 
damned sight too fast. I don’t like 
it. What’s happened to you?” 

“I’ve been going to night 
school.” 

“You’ve had ten months in this 
night school.” 

“Ten months?” Foyle echoed in 
amazement. “That long?” 

“Ten months without sight and 
without sound. Ten months in 



solitary. You ought to be broken.” 
“Oh, I’m broken, all right.” 
“You ought to be whining. I 
was right — you’re imusual. At this 
rate, it’s going to take too long. 
We can’t wait. I’d like to make 
a new offer.” 

“Make it.” 

“Ten per cent of Nomad’s bull- 
ion. Two million.” 

“Two million!” Foyle ex- 
claimed. “Why didn’t you offer 
that in the first place?” 

“Because I didn’t know your 
caliber. Is it a deal?” 

“Almost. Not yet.” 

“What else?” 

“I get out of Gouffre Martel.” 
“Naturally.” 

“And someone else, too.” 

“It can be arranged.” Dagen- 
ham’s voice sharpened. “Anything 
more?” 

“I get access to Presteign’s 
files.” 

“Are you insane? It’s out of 
the question.” 

“His shipping files.” 

“What for?” 

“A list of personnel aboard one 
of his ships.” 

“Oh.” Dagenham’s eagerness re- 
vived. “I can arrange that. Any- 
thing else?” 

“No.” 

“Then it’s a deal.” Dagenham 
was delighted. The deadly radio- 
active blur arose from its chair. 
“We’ll have you out in six hours. 
We’ll start fixing things for your

friend at once. It’s a pity we 
wasted this time, but no one can 
figure you, Foyle.” 

“Why didn’t you send in a 
telepath to probe the information 
out of me?” 

“A telepath? Be reasonable, 
Foyle. There aren’t a dozen full 
telepaths in all the Inner Planets. 
Their time is earmarked for the 
next ten years. We couldn’t per- 
suade one to interrupt his sched- 
dule for love or money.” 

“I apologize, Dagenham. I 
thought you didn’t know your 
business.” 

“You very nearly hurt my feel- 
ings.” 

“So now I know you’re only 
lying.” 

“You’re flattering me.” 

“You could have hired a tele- 
path. For a cut of twenty million, 
you could have hired one with- 
out a bit of trouble.” 

“The government would 
never — ” 

“They don’t all work for the 
government. No, you’ve got some- 
thing too hot to let a telepath get 
near.” 

S AVAGELY, the blur of light 
leaped across the room and 
seized Foyle. “How much do you 
know, Foyle? What are you cov- 
ering? Who are you working for?” 
Dagenham’s hands shook. “What 
a fool I’ve been! Of course you’re 
unusual. You’re no common 

98 



spaceman. I asked you — who are 
you working for?” 

Foyle tore Dagenham’s hands 
loose. “No one,” he said. “No one 
except myself.” 

“No one, eh? Including your 
friend in Gouffre Martel you’re 
so eager to rescue? By God, you 
almost swindled me, Foyle. Tell 
Captain Y’ang-Yeovil I congratu- 
late him. He’s got a better staff 
than I thought.” 

“I never heard of any Y’ang- 
Yeovil.” 

“It’s no deal. You and your col- 
league are going to rot here. I’ll 
have you moved to the worst cell 
in the hospital. I’ll sink you to 
the bottom of Gouffre Martel. 
I’ll - Guard, here! G-” 

Foyle grasped Dagenham’s 
throat, dragged him down to 
the floor and hammered his head 
on the flagstones. Dagenham 
squirmed once and then was still. 

Foyle ripped the goggles off his 
face and put them on. Sight re- 
turned in soft red and rose lights 
and shadows. He was in a small 
reception room with a table and 
two chairs. 

Foyle stripped Dagenham’s 
jacket off and put it on with two 
quick jerks that split the shoul- 
ders. Dagenham’s cocked high- 
wayman’s hat lay on the table. 
Foyle clapped it on and pulled 
the brim down over his face. 

On opposite walls were two 
doors. Foyle opened one a crack. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




It led out to the north corridor. 
He closed it, leaped across the 
room and tried the other. It 
opened onto a jaunte-proof maze. 
Foyle slipped through the door 
and entered the maze. Without a 
guide to lead him through the 
labyrinth, he was immediately 
lost. He began to run around the 
twists and turns and found him- 
self back at the reception room. 
Dagenham was struggling to his 
knees. 

Foyle turned back into the 
maze again. He ran. He came to 
a closed door and thrust it open. 
It revealed a large workshop illu- 
minated by normal light. Two 
technicians working at a machine 
bench looked up in surprise. 

Foyle snatched up a sledge 
hammer, leaped on them like a 
caveman and felled them. Behind 
him, he heard Dagenham shout- 
ing in the distance. He looked 
around wildly, dreading the dis- 
covery that he was trapped in a 
cul de sac. The workshop was L- 
shaped. Foyle tore around the 
corner, burst through the en- 
trance of another jaunte-proof 
maze and was lost again. 

The Gouffre Martel alarm sys- 
tem began clattering. Foyle bat- 
tered at the walls of the labyrinth 
with the sledge, shattered the 
thin plastic masking and found 
himself in the infra-red-lit south 
corridor of the Women’s Quad- 
rant. 

THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



^^WO women guards came up 
the corridor, running hard. 
Foyle swung the sledge and 
dropped them. He was near the 
head of the corridor. Before him 
stretched a long perspective of 
cell doors, each bearing a glowing 
red number. Overhead, the cor- 
ridor was lit by glowing red 
globes. Foyle stood on tiptoe and 
clubbed the globe above him. He 
hammered through the socket and 
smashed the current cable. The 
entire corridor went dark. 

“Evens us up — all in the dark 
now,” Foyle gasped, and tore 
down the corridor, feeling the 
wall as he ran and counting cell 
doors. Jisbella had given him an 
accurate word picture of the 
South Quadrant. He was counting 
his way toward South-900. He 
blundered into a figure, another 
guard. Foyle struck at her once 
with his sledge. She fell. The 
women patients began shrieking. 
Foyle lost count, ran on, stopped. 

“Jiz!” he bellowed. 

He heard her voice. He en- 
countered another guard, dis- 
posed of her, ran, located Jis- 
bella’s cell. 

“Gully, for God’s sake . .” 
Her voice was muffled. 

“Get back, girl. Back.” He ham- 
mered against the door with his 
sledge and it burst inward. He 
staggered in and fell against a 
figure. 

“Jiz?” he panted. “Excuse me.

Was passing by. Thought I’d 
drop in.” 

“Gully, in the name of—” 
“Yeah. Hell of a way to meet, 
eh? Come on. Out, girl. Out!” He 
dragged her out of the cell. “We 
can’t try a break through the 
offices. They don’t like me back 
there. Which way to your Sani- 
tation pens?” 

“Gully, you’re crazy.” 

“Whole quadrant’s dark. I 
smashed the power cable. We’ve 
got half a chance. Go!” 

He gave her a powerful thrust 
and she led him down the pas- 
sages to the automatic stalls of 
the women’s Sanitation pens. 
While mechanical hands removed 
their uniforms, soaped, soaked, 
sprayed and disinfected them, 
Foyle felt for the glass pane of 
the medical observation window. 
He found it, swung the sledge and 
smashed it. 

“Get in, Jiz.” 

IT E shoved her through the 
window and followed. They 
were both stripped, greasy with 
soap, slashed and bleeding. Foyle 
slipped and crashed through the 
blackness, searching for the door 
through which the medical officers 
entered. 

“Can’t find the door, Jiz. Door 
from the clinic. I — ” 

“Shh!” 

“But - ” 

A soapy hand found his mouth 
100 



and clamped over it. She gripped 
his shoulder so hard that her 
fingernails pierced his skin. 
Through the bedlam in the cav- 
erns sounded the clatter of steps 
close at hand. Guards were rxm- 
ning blindly through the Sanita- 
tion stalls. The infra-red lights 
had not yet been repaired. 

“They may not notice the win- 
dow,” Jisbella hissed. “Be quiet.” 
They crouched on the floor. 
Steps trampled through the pens 
in bewildering succession. Then 
they were gone. 

“All clear now,” Jisbella whis- 
pered. “But they’ll have search- 
lights any minute. Quick, Gully. 
Out.” 

“But the door to the clinic, 
Jiz. I thought — ” 

“There is no door. They use 
spiral stairs and they pull them 
up. They’ve thought of this es- 
cape, too. We’ll have to try the 
laundry lift. Lord know what 
good it’ll do us. Oh, Gully, you 
fool! You utter fool!” 

They climbed through the ob- 
servation window back into the 
pens. They searched through the 
darkness for the lifts by which 
soiled uniforms were removed and 
fresh uniforms issued. They could 
find nothing. And in the darkness, 
the automatic hands again 
soaped, sprayed and disinfected 
them. 

The caterwauling of a siren 
suddenly echoed through the 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




caverns, silencing all other sound. 
There came a hush as suffocating 
as the darkness. 

“They’re using the G-phone to 
track us, Gully.” 

“The what?” 

“Geophone. It can trace sound 
through half a mile of solid rock. 
That’s why they’ve sirened for 
silence.” 

“The laundry lift?” 

“Can’t find it.” 

“Then come on.” 

“Where?” 

“We’re running.” 

“Where?” 

“I don’t know, but I’m not 
getting caught flat-footed. Let’s 
go. The exercise’ll do you good.” 

A GAIN he thrust Jisbella be- 
fore him and they ran, gasp- 
ing and stumbling, through the 
blackness, down into the deepest 
reaches of South Quadrant. Jis- 
bella fell twice, blundering against 
turns in the passages. Foyle took 
the lead, holding the sledge in 
his hand, the handle extended 
before him as an antenna. But 
they crashed into a blank wall 
and realized they had reached 
the dead end of the corridor. 
They were boxed, trapped. 

“What now?” she wheezed. 
“Don’t know. Looks like the 
dead end of my ideas, too. We 
can’t go back for sure. I clobbered 
Dagenham in the offices. Hate 
that man. Looks like a poison 



label with that radioactivity of 
his. You got a flash, girl?” 

“Oh, Gully . Gully . .” 
Jisbella sobbed. 

“Was counting on you for 
ideas. ‘No more bombs,’ you said. 
Wish I had one now. Could — 
Wait a minute.” He touched the 
oozing wall against which they 
were leaning. He felt the checker- 
board indentations of mortar 
seams. “Bulletin from G. Foyle. 
This isn’t a natural cave wall. 
It’s made of brick and stone. 
Feel.” 

Jisbella felt the wall. “So?” 

“Means this passage don’t end 
here. Goes on. They blocked it 
off. Out of my way.” 

He shoved Jisbella up the pas- 
sage, ground his hands into the 
floor to grit his soapy palms, and 
began swinging the sledge against 
the wall. He swung in steady 
rhythm, grunting at each blow. 
The steel sledge hit the wall with 
the blunt concussion of stones 
struck under water. 

“They’re coming,” Jiz said. “I 
hear them.” 

The blunt blows took on a 
crumbling, crushing overtone. 
There was a whisper, then a 
steady pebble-fall of loose mortar. 
Foyle struck harder, faster. Sud- 
denly there was a crash and a 
gush of icy air blew in their 
faces. 

“Through,” Foyle muttered. 

Ferociously, he attacked the 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



101 




edges of the hole pierced through 
the wall. Bricks, stones and old 
mortar flew. Foyle stopped and 
called Jisbella. 

“Try it.” 

He dropped the sledge, seized 
her and held her up to the chest- 
high opening. She cried out in 
pain as she tried to wriggle past 
the sharp edges. Foyle pressed 
her relentlessly until she got her 
shoulders and then her hips 
through. He let go of her legs 
and heard her fall on the other 
side. 

^OYLE pulled himself up and 
tore his way through the 
jagged breach in the wall. He felt 
Jisbella’s hands trying to break 
his fall as he crashed down in a 
mass of loose brick and mortar. 
They were both through into the 
icy blackness of the unoccupied 
caverns of Gouffre Martel . 
miles of unexplored grottoes and 
caves. 

“By God, we’ll make it yet,” 
Foyle mumbled. 

“I don’t know if there’s a way 
out. Gully.” Jisbella was shaking 
with cold. “Maybe this is all blind 
alley, walled off from the hospi- 
tal.” 

“There has to be a way out.” 

“I don’t know if we can find 
it.” 

“We’ve got to find it. Let’s go, 
girl.” 

They blundered forward in the 

102 



darkness. Foyle tore the useless 
goggles from his eyes. They 
crashed against ledges, corners, 
low ceilings; they fell down slopes 
and steep steps. They climbed 
over a razor-back ridge to a level 
plain and their feet shot from 
under them. Both fell heavily to 
a glassy floor. Foyle felt it and 
touched it with his tongue. 

“Ice,” he panted. “Good sign. 
We’re in an ice cavern, Jiz. Under- 
ground glacier.” 

They arose shakily, straddling 
their legs and worked their way 
across the ice that had been 
forming in the Gouffre Martel 
abyss for millennia. They climbed 
into a forest of stone saplings 
that were stalagmites and sta- 
lactites thrusting up from the 
jagged floor and down from the 
ceilings. The vibrations of every 
step loosened the huge stalactites, 
ponderous stone spears that 
thundered down from overhead. 

At the edge of the forest, Foyle 
stopped, reached out and tugged. 
There was a clear metallic ring. 
He took Jisbella’s hand and 
placed the long tapering cone of 
a stalagmite in it. 

“Cane,” he grunted. “Use it like 
a blind man.” 

He broke off another and they 
went tapping, feeling, stumbling 
through the darkness. There was 
no sound but the gallop of panic 
. their gasping breath and 
racing hearts, the taps of their 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




stone canes, the multitudinous 
drip of water, the distant rushing 
of the underground river beneath 
Gouffre Martel. 

“Not that way, girl.” Foyle 
nudged her shoulder. “More to 
the left.” 

“Have you the faintest notion 
where we’re headed, Gully?” 
“Down, Jiz. Follow any slope 
that leads down.” 

“You’ve got an idea?” 

“Yeah. Surprise, surprise! Brains 
instead of bombs.” 

“Brains instead of — ” Jisbella 
screamed with hysterical laughter. 
“You exploded into South Quad- 
rant w-with a sledge hammer and 
th-that’s your idea of b-brains 
instead of b-b-b — ” 

Che shrieked and giggled be- 
^ yond all control until Foyle 
grasped her and shook her. 

“Shut up, Jiz. If they’re track- 
ing us by G-phone, they could 
hear you from Mars.” 

“S-sorry, Gully. Sorry. I . .” 
She took a breath. “Why down?” 
“The river — the one we hear 
all the time. It must be near. It 
probably melts off the glacier 
back there.” 

“The river?” 

“The only sure way out. It 
must break out of the mountain 
somewhere. We’ll swim.” 

“Gully, you’re insane!” 

“What’s a matter, you? You 
can’t swim?” 



“I can swim, but — ” 

“Then we’ve got to try. Got 
to, Jiz. Come on.” 

The rush of the river grew 
louder as their strength began to 
fail. Jisbella pulled to a halt 
at last, gasping. 

“Gully, I’ve got to rest.” 

“Too cold. Keeping moving.” 
“I can’t.” 

“Keep moving.” He felt for 
her arm. 

“Get your hands off me!” she 
cried furiously. 

He released her in amazement. 
“What’s the matter with you? 
Don’t lose your head, Jiz. I’m 
depending on you.” 

“For what? I told you we had 
to plan . work out an escape 
. and now you’ve trapped us 
into this.” 

“I was trapped myself. Dagen- 
ham was going to change my 
cell. No more Whisper Line for 
us. I had to, Jiz . and we’re 
out, aren’t we?” 

“Out where? Lost in Gouffre 
Martel. Looking for a river to 
drown in. You’re a fool. Gully, 
and I’m an idiot for letting you 
trap me into this. Damn you! 
You pull everything down to 
your imbecile level and you’ve 
pulled me down, too. Run. Fight. 
Punch. That’s all you know. Beat. 
Break. Blast. Destroy — Gully!” 
Jisbella screamed. There was 
a clatter of loose stone in the 
darkness and her scream faded

down and away to a heavy splash. 
Foyle heard the thrash of her 
body in water. 

He leaped forward, shouted, 
“Jiz!” and staggered over the 
edge of a precipice. 

He fell and struck the water 
flat with a stunning impact. The 
icy river enclosed him and he 
could not tell where the surface 
was. 

XTE struggled, suffocated, felt 
the swift current drag him 
against the chill slime of rocks, 
and then was home bubbling to 
the surface. He coughed and 
shouted. He heard Jisbella an- 
swer, her voice faint and muffled 
by the roaring torrent. He swam 
with the current, trying to over- 
take her. 

He shouted and heard her 
growing fainter and fainter. The 
roaring grew louder and abruptly 
he was shot down the hissing 
sheet of a waterfall. He plunged 
to the bottom of a deep pool 
and struggled once more to the 
surface. The whirling current en- 
tangled him with a cold body 
bracing itself against a smooth 
rock wall. 

“Jiz!” 

“Gully! Thank God!” 

They climg together for a 
moment while the water tore at 
them. 

“Gully . .” Jisbella coughed. 
“It goes through here.” 



“The river?” 

“Yes.” 

He squirmed past her and felt 
the mouth of an imderwater 
timnel. The current was sucking 
them into it. 

“Hold on,” Foyle wheezed. He 
explored to the left and the right. 
The walls of the pool were 
smooth, without handhold. 

“We can’t climb out. Have to 
go through.” 

“There’s no air. Gully. No sur- 
face.” 

“Couldn’t be forever. We’ll 
hold our breath.” 

“It could be longer than we 
can hold our breath.” 

“Have to gamble.” 

“I can’t do it.” 

“You must. No other way. 
Pump your lungs. Hold on to 
me.” 

They supported each other in 
the water, gasping for breath, fill- 
ing their limgs. 

Foyle nudged Jisbella toward 
the underwater tunnel. “You go 
first. I’ll be right behind . help 
you in case you get into any 
trouble.” 

“Trouble!” Jisbella cried in a 
shaking voice. She submerged 
and permitted the current to pull 
her into the tunnel mouth. Foyle 
followed. The fierce waters drew 
them down, down, down, carom- 
ing from side to side of a tunnel 
that had been worn glass-smooth. 
Foyle swam close behind Jisbella, 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




feeling her thrashing legs beat 
his head and shoulders. 

They tumbled through the tun- 
nel until their lungs burst and 
their blind eyes started. Then 
there was a roaring again and a 
surface, and they could breathe. 
The glassy tunnel sides were re- 
placed by jagged rocks. Foyle 
caught Jisbella’s leg and seized 
a stone projection at the side of 
the river. 

“Got to climb out here!” he 
shouted. 

“What?” 

“Got to climb out. You hear 
that roaring up ahead? Rapids. 
Be torn to pieces. Out, Jiz.” 

S HE was too weak to climb out 
of the water. He thrust her 
body up onto the rocks and fol- 
lowed. They lay on the dripping 
stones, too exhausted to speak. 
At last Foyle got wearily to his 
feet. 

“Have to keep on,” he said. 
“Follow the river. Ready?” 

She could not answer; she 
could not protest. He pulled her 
up and they went stumbling 
through the darkness, trying to 
follow the bank of the torrent. 
The boulders they traversed were 
gigantic, standing like dolmens, 
heaped, jumbled, scattered into a 
labyrinth. They lurched and 
twisted through them and lost 
the river. They could hear it in 
the darkness; they could not get 



back to it. They could get no- 
where. 

Foyle grunted in disgust. 
“We’re lost again. Really lost 
this time. What are we going to 
do?” 

Jisbella began to cry. She 
made helpless yet furious sounds. 
Foyle dragged to a stop and sat 
down, drawing her down with 
him. 

“Maybe you’re right, girl,” he 
said wearily. “Maybe I am a 
damned fool. I got us trapped 
into this no-jaunte jam and we’re 
licked.” 

She didn’t answer. 

“So much for brainwork. Hell 
of an education you gave me.” 
He hesitated. “You think we 
ought to try back-tracking to the 
hospital?” 

“We’ll never make it.” 

“Guess not. Was just practic- 
ing my brain. Should we make a 
racket so they can track us by 
G-phone?” 

“They’d never hear iis . 
never find us in time.” 

“We could make enough noise. 
You could knock me around a 
little. Be a pleasure for both of 
us.” 

“Shut up.” 

“What a mess!” He sagged 
back, cushioning his head on a 
tuft of soft grass. “At least I had 
a chance aboard Nomad. There 
was food and I could see where 
I was trying to go. I could — ” He

broke off and sat bolt upright 
“Jiz!” 

“Don’t talk so much.” 

IITE felt the ground under 
him and clawed up sod and 
tufts of grass. He thrust them 
into her face. 

“Smell this!” He laughed. 
“Taste it. It’s grass, Jiz. Earth 
and grass. We must be out of 
Gouffre Martel.” 

“What?” 

“It’s night outside. Overcast. 
We came out of the caves and 
never knew it. We’re out, Jiz!” 

They leaped to their feet, peer- 
ing, listening, sniffing. The night 
was impenetrable, but they heard 
the soft sigh of night winds, and 
the sweet scent of green growing 
things came to their nostrils. Far 
in the distance, a dog barked. 

“Good Lord, Gully,” Jisbella 
whispered incredulously. “You’re 
right. We’re out of Gouffre Mar- 
tel. All we have to do is wait for 
dawn.” 

She laughed. She flung her 
arms about him and kissed him. 
They babbled excitedly. They 
sank down on the soft grass 
again, weary, but unable to rest, 
eager, impatient, all life before 
them. 

“Hello, Gully, darling Gully. 
Hello, Gully, after all this time.” 

“Hello, Jiz.” 

“I told you we’d meet some 
day . some day soon. I told 



you, darling. And this is the day.” 

“The night.” 

“The night, so it is. But no 
more murmuring in the night 
along the Whisper Line. No more 
night for us. Gully dear.” 

Suddenly they became aware 
that they were nude, lying close, 
no longer separated. Jisbella fell 
silent, but did not move. He 
clasped her almost angrily with a 
desire that was no less than hers. 

When dawn came, he saw that 
she was lovely, long and lean, 
with smoky red hair and a gen- 
erous mouth. 

But when dawn came, she saw 
his face.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Baker sat on the cool veranda of 
his Spokane mansion, listening to 
Jiz McQueen finish ‘the story of 
her escape. 

“Once we hit the open country 
outside Gouffre Martel, it was 
easy. We found a shooting lodge, 
broke in and got some clothes. 
There were guns there, too — 
lovely old steel things for killing 
with explosives. We took them 
and sold them to some locals. 
Then we bought rides to the near- 
est jaunte stage we had memo- 
rized.” 

“Which?” 

“Biarritz.” 

“Traveled by night, eh?” 
“Naturally.” 

“Do anything about Foyle’s 
face?” 

“We tried makeup, but that 
didn’t work. The damned tattoo- 
ing showed through. Then I 
bought a dark skin-surrogate and 
sprayed it on.” 

“Did that do it?” 

“No,” Jiz said angrily. “You 
have to keep your face quiet or 
else the surrogate cracks and 
peels. Foyle couldn’t control him- 
self. He never can. It was plain 
hell.” 

“Where is he now?” 

“Sam Quatt’s got him in tow.” 
“I thought Sam retired from 
the rackets.” 

“He did,” Jisbella said grimly, 
“but he owes me a favor. He’s 
minding Foyle. They’re circulat- 



ing on the jaunte to stay ahead 
of the cops.” 

ff|NTERESTING,” Baker 
said musingly. “Haven’t 
seen a tattoo case in all my life. 
Thought it was a dead art. I’d 
like to add him to my collection. 
Do you know I collect curios, 
Jiz?” 

“Everybody knows that zoo of 
yours in Trenton, Baker. It’s 
ghastly.” 

“I picked up a genuine frater- 
nal cyst last month—” Baker be- 
gan enthusiastically. 

“I don’t want to hear about it,” 
she snapped. “And I don’t want 
Foyle in your zoo. Can you get 
the muck off his face? Clean it 
up? He says they were stymied 
at General Hospital.” 

“They haven’t had my expe- 
rience, dear. Hmm. I seem to re- 
member reading something once 
somewhere. Now where did I — ? 
Wait a minute.” 

Baker stood up and disappeared 
with a faint pop. Jisbella paced 
the veranda fiercely until he re- 
appeared twenty minutes later 
with a tattered book in his, hands 
and a triumphant expression on 
his face. 

“Got it,” Baker said. “Saw it in 
the Caltech Library stacks three 
years ago. You may admire my 
memory.” 

“To hell with your memory. 
What about his face?”

Baker flipped the fragile pages 
and meditated. “Indigotin disul- 
phonic acid. I may have to syn- 
thesize the acid, but . .” He 
closed the text and nodded em- 
phatically. “I can do it. Only it 
seems a pity to tamper with that 
face if it’s as unique as you de- 
scribe it.” 

“Will you get off your disgust- 
ing hobby?” Jisbella exclaimed in 
exasperation. ‘We’re hot, under- 
stand? The first that ever broke 
out of Gouffre Martel. The cops 
won’t rest until they’ve got us 
back. This is extra-special for 
them.” 

“But 

“How long do you think we 
can stay out of Gouffre Martel 
with Foyle running around with 
that tattooed face?” 

“What are you so angry 
about?” 

“I’m not angry. I’m explaining. 

“He’d be happy in the zoo,” 
Baker said persuasively. “And 
he’d be under cover there. I’d put 
him in the room next to the Cy- 
clops girl—” 

“The zoo is out. That’s defi- 
nite.” 

“All right, Jiz. But why are 
you worried about Foyle being 
recaptured? It won’t have any- 
thing to do with you.” 

“Why should you worry about 
me worrying? I’m asking you to 
do a job. I’m paying for it.” 

“It’ll be expensive, dear, and 



I’m fond of you. I’m trying to 
save you money.” 

“No, you’re not.” 

“Then I’m curious.” 

“Then let’s say I’m grateful. He 
helped me; now I’m helping him.” 
He smiled cynically. “Then let’s 
help him with a brand-new face.” 
“No,” she said in a flat, decisive 
voice. 

“I thought so. You want his 
face cleaned up because you’re 
interested in his face.” 

“Damn you. Baker, will you do 
the job or not?” 

“It’ll cost five thousand.” 
“Break that down.” 

“A thousand to synthesize the 
acid. Three thousand for the 
surgery. And one thousand for—” 
“Your curiosity?” 

“No, dear.” Baker smiled again. 
“A thousand for the anesthetist.” 
“Why anesthesia?” 

He reopened the ancient text. 
“It looks like a painful operation. 
You know how tattooing is done? 
They take a needle, dip it in dye, 
and punch it into the skin. To 
bleach that dye out. I’ll have to 
go over his face with a needle, 
pore by pore, and punch in the 
indigotin disulphonic. It’ll hurt.” 
Jisbella’s eyes flashed. “Can 
you do it without the dope?” 

“I can, Jiz, but Foyle—” 
“Forget Foyle! I’m paying four 
thousand. Let him suffer.” 

“Jiz! You don’t know what 
you’re letting him in for!”

“I know. Let him suffer.” She 
laughed so furiously that she 
startled Baker. “Let his face 
make him suffer, too.” 

15 AKER’S Freak Factory occu- 
pied a round brick three- 
story building that had once been 
the roundhouse in a suburban 
railway yard before jaunting 
ended the need for suburban 
railroads. 

The ancient ivy-covered round- 
house was alongside the Trenton 
rocket pits, and the rear windows 
looked out on the mouths of the 
pits thrusting their anti-grav 
beams upward, and Baker’s pa- 
tients could amuse themselves 
watching the spaceships riding si- 
lently up and down the beams, 
their portholes blazing, recogni- 
tion signals blinking, their hulls 
rippling with St. Elmo’s fire as the 
atmosphere carried off the elec- 
trostatic charges built up in outer 
space. 

The basement floor of the fac- 
tory contained Baker’s zoo of 
anatomical curiosities, natural 
freaks and monsters bought and/ 
or abducted. Baker, like the rest 
of his world, was passionately de- 
voted to these creatures and spent 
long hours with them, drinking in 
the spectacle of their distortions 
the way other men saturated 
themselves in the past with the 
beauty of art. 

The middle floor of the round- 



house contained bedrooms for 
post-operative patients, laborato- 
ries, staff rooms, and kitchens. 

The top floor contained the op- 
erating theaters. 

In one of the latter, a small 
room usually used for retinal ex- 
periments, Baker was at work on 
Foyle’s face. Under a harsh bat- 
tery of lamps, he bent over the 
operating table, working meticu- 
lously with a small steel hammer 
and a platinum needle. Baker 
was following the pattern of the 
old tattooing on Foyle’s face, 
searching out each minute scar 
in the skin and driving the needle 
into it. 

Foyle’s head was gripped in a 
clamp, but his body was un- 
strapped. His muscles writhed at 
each tap of the hammer, but he 
never moved his body. He gripped 
the sides of the operating table. 

“Control,” he said through his 
teeth. “You wanted me to learn 
control, Jiz. I’m practicing.” He 
winced. 

“Don’t move,” Baker ordered. 

“I’m playing it for laughs.” 

“You’re doing all right, son,” 
Sam Quatt said, looking sick. He 
glanced sidelong at Jisbella’s fe- 
rocious face. “What do you say, 
Jiz?” 

“He’s learning.” 

Baker continued dipping and 
hammering the needle. 

“Listen, Sam,” Foyle mumbled, 
barely audible. “Jiz told me you

own a private ship. Crime pays, 
huh?” 

“Yeah, crime pays. I got a lit- 
tle four-man job. Twin-jet. Kind 
they call a Saturn Weekender.” 
“Why Saturn Weekender?” 
“Because a weekend on Saturn 
would last ninety days. She can 
carry food and fuel for three 
months.” 

“Just right for me,” Foyle mut- 
tered. 

XT E WRITHED and controlled 
himself. “Sam, I want to 
rent your ship.” 

“What for?” 

“Something hot.” 

“Legitimate?” 

“No.” 

“Then it’s not for me, son. I’ve 
lost my nerve. Jaunting the cir- 
cuit with you, one step ahead of 
the cops, showed me that. I’ve re- 
tired for keeps. All I want is 
peace.” 

“I’ll pay fifty thousand. Don’t 
ycu want fifty thousand? Ycu 
could spend Sundays counting it.” 
The needle was hammering 
remorselessly. Foyle’s body was 
twitching at each impact. 

“I already got fifty thousand. 
I got ten times that in cash in a 
bank in Vienna.” Quatt reached 
into his pocket and took out a 
ring of glittering sonic keys. 
“Here’s the key for the bank. 
This is the key to my place in 
Joburg. Twenty rooms, twenty 

no 



acres. This here’s the key to my 
Weekender in Montauk. You ain’t 
temptin’ me, son. I quit while I 
was ahead. I’m jaunting back to 
Joburg and live happy for the 
rest of my life.” 

“Let me have the Weekender. 
You can sit safe in Joburg and 
collect.” 

“Collect when?” 

“When I get back.” 

“You want my ship on trust 
and a promise to pay?” 

“A guarantee.” 

Quatt snorted. “What guaran- 
tee?” 

“It’s a salvage job in the aster- 
oids. Ship named Nomad.” 

“What’s on the Nomad? What 
makes the salvage pay off?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“You’re lying.” 

“I don’t know,” Foyle insisted 
stubbornly. “But there has to be 
something valuable. Ask Jiz.” 
“Listen,” Quatt said, “I’m going 
to teach you something. We do 
business legitimate, see? We don’t 
slash and scalp. We don’t hold 
out. I know what’s on your mind. 
You got something juicy, but you 
don’t want to cut anybody else 
in on it. That’s why ^ you’re beg- 
ging for favors.” 

T^OYLE writhed under the nee- 
-*■ die, but, still gripped in the 
vice of his possession, was forced 
to repeat; “I don’t know, Sam. 
Ask Jiz.” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“If you’ve got an honest deal, 
make an honest proposition,” 
Quatt said angrily. “Don’t come 
prowling around like a damned 
tattooed tiger figuring how to 
poimce. We’re the only friends 
you got. Don’t try to slash and 
scalp — ” 

Quatt was interrupted by a cry 
tom from Foyle’s lips. 

“Hold still,” Baker said in an 
abstracted voice. “When you 
twitch your face, I can’t control 
the needle.” He looked hard and 
long at Jisbella. 

Her lips trembled. Suddenly 
she opened her purse and took 
out two Cr 500 banknotes. She 
dropped them alongside the 
beaker of acid. 

“We’ll wait outside,” she said. 

She fainted in the hall. Quatt 
dragged her to a chair and found 
a nurse, who revived her with 
aromatic ammonia. She began to 
cry so violently that Quatt was 
frightened. He dismissed the 
nurse and hovered until the sob- 
bing subsided. 

“What the hell has been going 
on?” he demanded. “What was 
that money supposed to mean?” 

“It was blood money.” 

“For what?” 

“I don’t want to talk about it.” 

“Are you all right?” 

“No.” 

“Anything I can do?” 

“No.” 

There was a long pause. Then 



Jisbella ask^ in a weary vdice: 
“Are you going to make ^at deal 
with Gully?” 

“Me? Not a chance. It sounds 
like a thousand-to-one shot” 
“There has to be something 
valuable on the Nomad. Otfier- 
wise Dagenham wouldn’t have 
hounded Gully.” 

“I’m still not interested. What 
about you?” 

“Not interested, either. I don’t 
want any part of Gully Foyle 
again.” 

After another pause, Quatt 
asked: “Can I go home now?” 
“You’ve had a rough time, 
haven’t you, Sam?” 

“I think I died about a thou- 
sand times nurse-maidin’ that 
tiger around the circuit.” 

“I’m sorry, Sam.” 

“I had it coming to me, after 
what I did to you when you were 
copped in Memphis.” 

“Rimning out on me was only 
natural, Sam.” 

Q uatt shrugged. ‘We always 
do what’s natural, only some- 
times we shouldn’t do it.” 

“I know, Sam. I know.” 

“And you spend the rest of 
your life trying to make up for it. 
1 figure I’m lucky, Jiz. I was able 
to square it tonight. Can I go 
home now?” 

“Back to Joburg and the happy 
life?” 

“Uh-huh.”

"Don’t leave me alone yet, 
Snm. I’m ashamed of myself.” 
“What for?” 

"Cruelty to dumb animals.” 
“What’s that supposed to 
mean?” 

“Never mind. Hang around a 
little. Tell me about the happy 
life. What’s so happy about it?” 
“Well,” Quatt said reflectively, 
“it’s having everything you 
wanted when you were a kid. If 
you can have evers^thing at fifty 
that you wanted when you were 
fifteen, you’re happy. Now when 
I was fifteen . .” And Quatt went 
on and on describing the sym- 
bols, ambitions and frustrations 
of his boyhood which he was now 
satisfying, until Baker came out 
of the operating theater. 

“Finished?” Jisbella asked ea- 
gerly. 

“Finished. After I put him un- 
der, I was able to work faster. 
They’re bandaging his face now. 
He’ll be out in a few minutes.” 
“Weak?” 

“Naturally.” 

“How long before the bandages 
come off?” 

“Six or seven days.” 

“His face’ll be clean?” 

“I thought you weren’t inter- 
ested in his face, Jiz. It ought to 
be clean. I don’t think I missed a 
spot of pigment. You may admire 
my skill, Jisbella — also my saga- 
city. I’m going to back Foyle’s 
salvage trip.” 

t m 



Quatt laughed. “You taking a 
thousand-to-one gamble. Baker? 
I thought you were smart.” 

“I am. He’s in shock and he 
talked under the anesthesia. 
There’s twenty million in plati- 
num bullion aboard the Nomad.” 

“Twenty million!” Sam Quatt’s 
face darkened and he turned on 
Jisbella. 

But she was also furious. “Don’t 
look at me, Sam. I didn’t know. 
He held out on me, too. Swore he 
never knew why Dagenham was 
hounding him.” 

“It was Dagenham who told 
him,” Baker said. “That was an- 
other thing he let slip.” 

“I’ll kill him,” Jisbella snapped. 
“I’ll tear him apart with my own 
two hands and you won’t find 
anything inside his carcass but 
black rot. He’ll be a curio for 
your zoo. Baker. I wish to God 
I’d let you have him!” 

^I'HE door of the operating 
theater opened and two or- 
derlies wheeled out a trolley on 
which Foyle lay, twitching 
slightly. His entire head was one 
white globe of bandage. 

“Is he conscious?” Quatt asked 
Baker. 

“I’ll handle this,” Jisbella burst 
out. “I’ll talk to the son of a — 
Foyle!” 

Foyle answered faintly through 
the mask of bandage. As Jisbella 
drew a savage breath for her on- 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




slaught, one wall of the hospital 
disappeared and there was a clap 
of thunder that knocked them to 
their feet. The entire building 
rocked from repeated explosions, 
and through the gaps in the walls, 
uniformed men began jaunting in 
from the streets outside, like 
rooks swooping into the gut of a 
battlefield. 

“Raid!” Baker shouted. 
“Christ!” Quatt shook. 

The vmiformed men were 
swarming all over the building, 
shouting: “Foyle! Foyle!” 

Baker disappeared with a pop. 
The attendants jaunted, too, de- 
serting the trolley on which Foyle 
waved his arms and legs feebly, 
making faint soimds. 

“It’s a goddam raid!” Quatt 
shook Jisbella. “Go, girl! Go!” 
“We can’t leave Foyle!” 

“Wake up, girl! Go!” 

“No.” 

Jisbella seized the trolley and 
ran it down the corridor. Quatt 
pounded alongside her. The roar- 
ing in the hospital grew louder: 
“Foyle! Foyle! Foyle!” 

“Leave him!” Quatt urged. 
“Let them have him.” 

“No.” 

“It’s a lobo for us, girl, if they 
get us.” 

“We can’t run out on him.” 
They skidded around a corner 
into a shrieking mob of post- 
operative patients, bird men with 
fluttering wings, mermaids drag- 



ging themselves along the floor 
like seals, hermaphrodites, giants, 
pygmies, two-headed twins, cen- 
taurs, and a mewling sphinx. 
They clawed at Jisbella and 
Quatt in terror. 

“Get him off the trolley!” Jis- 
bella cried. 

Quatt yanked Foyle off the 
trolley. Foyle came to his feet 
and sagged. Jisbella took his arm 
and, between them, Sam and Jiz 
hauled him through a door into a 
ward filled with Baker’s temporal 
freaks — subjects with accelerated 
time-sense, darting about the ward 
with the lightning rapidity of 
humming birds and emitting 
piercing batlike squeals. 

“Jaunte him out, Sam.” 

“After the way he tried to cross 
and scalp us?” 

“We can’t ditch him, Sam. You 
ought to know that by now. 
Jaunte him out. Caister’s place!” 

Che helped Quatt haul Foyle 
^ to his shoulder. The temporal 
freaks seemed to fill 'the ward 
with shrieking streaks. The ward 
doors burst open. A dozen bolts 
from pneumatic guns whined 
through the ward, dropping the 
temporal patients in their gyra- 
tions. Quatt was slammed back 
against a wall, dropping Foyle. 
A black and blue bruise appeared 
on his temple. 

“Get out of here!” Quatt 
roared. “I’m done, Jiz!” 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



113 




“Sam!” she cried in panic. 

“I’m done. Can’t jaimte. Go, 
girl!” 

Trying to shake off the con- 
cussion that prevented him from 
jaunting, Quatt straightened and 
charged forward, meeting the uni- 
formed men who poured into the 
ward. Jisbella took Foyle’s arm 
and dragged him out the back of 
the ward, through a pantry, a 
clinic, a laundry supply, and 
down flights of ancient stairs that 
buckled and threw up clouds of 
termite dust. 

They came into a victual cel- 
lar. Baker’s zoo inmates had 
broken out of their cells in the 
chaos and were raiding the cellar 
like bees glutting themselves 
with honey in an attacked hive. 
A Cyclops girl was cramming her 
mcuth with handfuls of butter 
scooped from a tub. Her single 
eye above the bridge of her nose 
leered at them. 

Jisbella dragged Foyle through 
the victual cellar, found a bolted 
wooden door and kicked it open. 
They stumbled down a flight of 
crumbling steps and found them- 
selves in what had once been a 
coal cellar. The concussions and 
roarings overhead sounded deeper 
and hollow. A chute slot on one 
side of the cellar was barred with 
an iron door held by iron clamps. 
Jisbella placed Foyle’s hands on 
the clamps. Together they opened 
them and climbed out of the cel- 



lar through the coal chute. 

They were outside the Freak 
Factory, huddled against the rear 
wall. Before them were the Tren- 
ton Rocket pits, and as they 
gasped for breath, Jiz saw a 
freighter come sliding down an 
anti-grav beam into a waiting pit. 
Its portholes blazed and its rec- 
ognition signals blinked like a 
lurid neon sign, illuminating the 
back wall of the hospital. 

A figure leaped from the roof 
of the hospital. It was Sam Quatt, 
attempting a desperate flight. He 
sailed out into space, arms and 
legs flailing, trying to reach the 
up-thrusting anti-grav beam of 
the nearest pit which might catch 
him in mid-flight and cushion his 
fall. 

His aim was perfect. Seventy 
feet above ground, he dropped 
squarely into the shaft of the 
beam. 

It was not in operation. 

He fell and was smashed on 
the edge of the pit. 

J ISBELLA sobbed. Still auto- 
matically retaining her grip 
on Foyle’s arm, she ran across the 
seamed concrete to Sam Quart’s 
body. There she let go of Foyle 
and touched Quatt’s head tender- 
ly. Her fingers were stained with 
blood. Foyle tore at the bandage 
on his face, working eye-holes 
through the gauze. He muttered 
to himself, listening to Jisbella

weep and heating the shouts be- 
hind him from Baker’s factory. 
His hands fumbled at Quart’s 
body, then arose and tried to pull 
Jisbella up. 

“Got to go,” he croaked. “Got 
to get out. They’ve seen us.” 

Jisbella never moved. Foyle 
mustered all his strength and 
pulled her upright. 

“Times Square,” he said. 
“Jaunte, Jiz!” 

Uniformed figures appeared 
around them. Foyle shook Jis- 
bella’s arm and jaunted to Times 
Square, where masses of jaunters 
on the gigantic stage stared in 
amazement at the huge man with 
the white bandaged globe for a 
head. The stage was the size of 
two football fields. 

Foyle stared around dimly 
through the bandages. There was 
no sign of Jisbella, but she might 
be anywhere. He lifted his voice 
to a shout. 

“Montauk, Jiz! Montauk! The 
Folly Stage!” 

Foyle jaunted with a last 
thrust of energy and a prayer. An 
icy Nor’easter was blowing in 
from Block Island and sweeping 
brittle ice crystals across the 
stage on the site of a medieval 
ruin known as Fisher’s Folly. 
There was another figure on the 
stage. Foyle tottered to it through 
the wind and the snow. It was 
Jisbella, looking frozen and lost. 

“Thank God,” Foyle breathed 



almost reverently. “Thank God. 
Where does Sam keep his Week- 
ender?” He shook Jisbella’s el- 
bow. “Where does Sam keep his 
Weekender?” 

“Sam’s dead.” 

“Where does he keep that Sat- 
urn Weekender?” 

“He’s retired, Sam is. He’s not 
scared any more.” 

“Where’s the ship, Jiz?” 

“In the yards down at the 
lighthouse.” 

“Come on.” 

“Where?”’ 

“To Sam’s ship!” Foyle thrust 
his big hand before Jisbella’s 
eyes; a bunch of keys lay in his 
palm. “I took his keys. Come on.” 
“He gave them to you?” 

“I took them off his body.” 
“Ghoul!” She began to laugh. 
“Liar . Lecher . Tiger . 
Ghoul! The walking cancer . 
Gully Foyle.” 

Nevertheless she followed him 
through the snow storm to Mon- 
tauk Light.

Courier headquarters promptly.” 
The sideshow jaunted and dis- 
appeared. Regis Sheffield rubbed 
his eyes and asked: “What was 
that lunacy supposed to be, Dag- 
enham?” 

“Disturbs your legal mind, eh? 
That was part of the cast of our 
FFCC operation — fun, fantasy, 
confusion and catastrophe.” Dag- 
enham turned to Presteign and 
smiled his death’s-head smile. 
“I’ll return your fee if you like, 
Presteign.” 

“You’re quitting?” 

“No, I’m enjoying myself. I’ll 
work for nothing. I’ve never tan- 
gled with a man of Foyle’s caliber 
before. He’s unique.” 

“How?” Sheffield demanded. 

“I arranged for him to escape 
from Gouffre Martel. He escaped, 
all right — but not my way. I tried 
to keep him out of police hands 
with confusion and catastrophe. 
He ducked the police — but his 
own way. I tried to keep him out of 
Central Intelligence’s hands with 
fun and fantasy. He stayed clear 
— again his own way. I tried to 
detour him into a ship so he 
could make his try for Nomad. 
He wouldn’t detour — but he got 
his ship. He’s heading out now.” 
“You’re following?” 

“Naturally.” Dagenham hesi- 
tated. “But what was he doing in 
Baker’s factory?” 

“Plastic surgery?” Sheffield 
suggested. “A new face?” 



“Not possible. Baker’s good, 
but he can’t do a plastic that 
quick, so it had to be minor surg- 
ery. Foyle was on his feet with 
his head bandaged.” 

“The tattoo?” Presteign asked. 
Dagenham nodded and the 
smile left his lips. “That’s what’s 
worrying me. You realize, Pres- 
teign, that if Baker removed the 
tattooing, we’ll never recognize 
Foyle?” 

“My dear Dagenham, his face 
won’t be changed.” 

“We’ve never seen his face, 
only the mask.” 

“I haven’t met the man at all,” 
Sheffield said. “What’s the mask 
like?” 

“Like a tiger. I was with Foyle 
for two long sessions. I ought to 
know his face by heart, but I 
don’t. All I know is the tattooing.” 
“Ridiculous,” Sheffield stated 
bluntly. 

“No. Foyle has to be seen to 
be believed. However, it doesn’t 
matter. He’ll lead us out to No- 
mad. He’ll lead us to your bullion 
and PyrE, Presteign. I’m almost 
sorry it’s all over. As I said. I’ve 
been enjoying myself. He really 
is unique.”

Foyle and Jiz McQueen, Foyle 
slept in the main cabin; Jiz kept 
to herself in the stateroom. 

On the seventh day out, Jis- 
bella spoke to Foyle for the sec- 
ond time: “Let’s get those ban- 
dages off, Ghoul.” 

Foyle left the galley, where he 
was sullenly heating coffee, and 
kicked back in freefall to the 
bathroom. He floated in after Jis- 
bella and wedged himself into 
the alcove before the washbasin 
mirror. Jisbella braced herself on 
the basin, opened an ether cap- 
sule and began soaking and strip- 
ping the bandage off with hard, 
hating hands. The strips of gauze 
peeled slowly. 

“D’you think Baker did the 
job?” he asked in agonized sus- 
pense. 

No answer. 

“Could he have missed any- 
where?” 

The stripping continued. 

“It stopped hurting two days 
ago.” 

No answer. 

“For God’s sake, Jiz! Is it still 
war between us?” 

Jisbella’s hands stopped. She 
looked at Foyle’s bandaged face 
with hatred. “What do you 
think?” 

“I asked you.” 

“The answer is yes.” 

“Why?” 

“You’ll never vmderstand.” 

“Make me understand.” 



“Shut up.” 

“If it’s war, why*d you come 
with me?” 

“To get what’s coming to Sam 
and me.” 

“Money?” 

“Shut up.” 

“You didn’t have to come 
along. You could have trusted 
me.” 

“Trusted you? You?" Jisbella 
laughed without mirth and re- 
commenced the peeling. 

Foyle struck her hands away. 
“I’ll do it myself.” 

She lashed him across his ban- 
daged face. “You’ll do what I 
tell you. Be still. Ghoul!” 

Che continued unwinding the 
bandage. A strip came away, 
revealing Foyle’s eyes. They 
stared at Jisbella, dark and 
brooding. The eyelids were clean; 
the bridge of the nose was clean. 
A strip came away from Foyle’s 
chin. It was blue-black. Foyle, 
watching intently in the mirror, 
gasped. 

“He missed the chin!” he ex- 
claimed. “Baker goofed—” 

“Shut up,” Jiz answered 
shortly. “That’s whiskers.” 

The innermost strips came 
away quickly, revealing cheeks, 
mouth and brow. The brow was 
clean. The cheeks under the eyes 
were clean. The rest was covered 
with a blue-black seven-day 
beard.

“Shave,” Jiz commanded. 

Foyle ran water, soaked his 
face, rubbed in depilatory and 
washed the beard off. Then he 
leaned close to the mirror and in- 
spected himself, unaware that Jis- 
bella’s head was close to his as 
she, too, stared into the mirror. 
Not a mark of tattooing re- 
mained. Both sighed. 

“It’s off,” Foyle said. “All off. 
He did the job.” Suddenly he 
leaned farther forward and in- 
spected himself more closely. His 
face looked new to him, as new as 
it looked to Jisbella. “I’m 
changed. I don’t remember look- 
ing like this. Did he do surgery 
on me, too?” 

“No,” said Jisbella. “What’s in- 
side you changed it. That’s the 
ghoul you’re seeing, along with 
the liar and the cheat.” 

“Lay off! Let me alone!” 
“Ghoul,” Jisbella repeated, star- 
ing at Foyle’s face with glowing 
eyes. “Liar. Cheat.” 

He took her shoulders and 
shoved her out into the compan- 
ionway. She went sailing down 
into the main lounge, caught a 
guide-bar and spun herself 
around. 

“Ghoul!” she cried. “Liar! 
Cheat! Ghoul! Lecher! Beast!” 
Foyle pushed off after her, 
seized her again and shook her 
violently. Her red hair burst out 
of the clip that gathered it at the 
nape of her neck and floated out 



like a mermaid’s tresses. The 
burning expression on her face 
transformed Foyle’s anger into 
passion. He enveloped her and 
buried his new face in her breast 
“Lecher,” Jiz murmured. “Ani- 
mal.” 

“Jiz . .” 

“The light,” Jisbella whispered. 
Foyle reached out blindly to- 
ward the wall-switches and 
pressed buttons, and the Saturn 
Weekender drove on toward the 
asteroids with darkened port- 
holes. 

^ I ^HEY floated together in the 
cabin, drowsing, murmuring, 
touching tenderly for hours. 

“Poor Gully,” Jisbella whis- 
pered. “Poor darling Gully . .” 
“Not poor,” he said. “Rich. 
Soon.” 

“Yes, rich and empty. You’ve 
got nothing inside you. Gully 
dear. Nothing but hatred and re- 
venge.” 

“It’s enough.” 

“Enough for now. But later?” 
“Later? That depends.” 

“It depends on your inside. 
Gully; what you get hold of.” 
“No. My future depends on 
what I get rid of.” 

“Gully, why did you hold out 
on me in Gouffre Martel? Why 
didn’t you tell me you knew there 
was a fortune aboard Nomad?" 
“I couldn’t.” 

“Didn’t you trust me?” 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



119 




“It wasn’t that. I couldn’t help 
myself. That’s what’s inside me 
— what I have to get rid of.” 

“Control again, Gully? You’re 
driven.” 

“Yes, I’m driven. I can’t learn 
control, Jiz. I want to, but I 
can’t.” 

“Do you try?” 

“I do. God knows, I do. But 
then something happens and — ” 

“And then you pounce like a 
tiger.” 

“If I could carry you in my 
pocket, Jiz, to warn me, stick a 
pin in me . .” 

“Nobody can do it for you. 
Gully. You have to learn your- 
self.” 

He digested that for a long 
moment. Then he spoke hesi- 
tantly: “Jiz, about the money . .” 

“To hell with the money.” 

“Can I hold you to that?” 

“Oh, Gully.” 

“Not that I — that I’m trying 
to hold out on you. If it wasn’t for 
Vorga, I’d give you all you 
wanted. All! I’ll give you every 
cent left over when I’m finished. 
But I’m scared, Jiz. Vorga is 
tough, what with Presteign and 
Dagenham and that lawyer Shef- 
field. I’ve got to hold on to every 
cent, Jiz. I’m afraid if I let you 
take one credit, that could make 
the difference between Vorga 
and I.” 

“Me.” 

“Me.” He waited. “Well?” 



“You’re possessed,” she said 
wearily. “Not just a part of you, 
but all of you.” 

“No.” 

“Yes, Gully. All of you. It’s 
just your skin making love to me. 
The rest is feeding on Vorga.” 

At that moment, the radar 
alarm in the forward control 
cabin burst upon them, unwel- 
come and warning. 

“Destination zero,” Foyle said, 
no longer relaxed, once more pos- 
sessed. He shot forward into the 
control cabin. 

Co HE returned to the freak 
planetoid in the Asteroid 
Belt between Mars and Jupiter, 
the Sargasso planet manufac- 
tured of rock and wreckage and 
the spoils of space-disaster sal- 
vaged by the Scientific People. 
He returned to the home of 
J $ seph and his People who had 
tattooed “N S mad” across his 
face and scientifically mated him 
to the girl named M 2 ira. 

Foyle overran the asteroid with 
the sudden fury of a Vandal raid. 
He came blasting out of space, 
braked with a spume of flame 
from the forward jets, and kicked 
the Weekender into a tight spin 
around the junkheap. 

They whirled around, passing 
the blackened ports, the big hatch 
from which J S seph and his Sci- 
entific People emerged to collect 
the drifting debris of space, the 



120

new crater Foyle had tom out of 
the side of the asteroid in his first 
plunge back to Terra. They 
whipped past the giant patch- 
work windows of the asteroid 
greenhouse and saw hundreds of 
faces peering out at them, tiny 
white dots mottled with tattooing. 

“So I didn’t murder them,” 
Foyle grunted. “They’ve pulled 
back into the asteroid. Probably 
living deep inside while they get 
the rest repaired.” 

“Will you help them. Gully?” 

“Why?” 

“You did the damage.” 

“I’ve got my own problems. 
But it’s a relief. They won’t be 
bothering us.” 

He circled the asteroid once 
more and brought the Weekender 
down in the mouth of the new 
crater. 

“We’ll work from here,” he 
said. “Get into a suit, Jiz. Let’s 
go! Let’s go!” 

He drove her, mad with impa- 
tience; he drove himself. They 
corked up in their spacesuits, left 
the Weekender and went sprawl- 
ing through the debris in the crater 
into the bleak heart of the aster- 
oid. It was like squirming through 
the crawling tunnels of giant 
v7orm-holes. Foyle switched on 
his micro-wave suit-set and spoke 
to Jiz. 

“Be easy to get lost in here. 
Stay with me. Stay close.” 

“Where are we going. Gully?” 



“After Nomad. I remember 
they were cementing her into the 
asteroid when I left. Don’t re- 
member where. Have to find her.” 

^ I ''HE passages were airless and 
their progress was soundless, 
but the vibrations carried through 
metal and rock. They paused 
once for breath alongside the 
pitted hull of an ancient warship. 
As they leaned against it, they 
felt the vibrations of signals from 
within, a rhythmic knocking. 

Foyle smiled grimly. “That’s 
J $ seph and the Scientific People 
inside, requesting a few words. 
I’ll give ’em an evasive answer.” 
He pounded twice on the hull. 
“And now a personal message for 
my wife.” His face darkened. He 
smote the hull angrily and 
turned away. “Come on. Let’s go.” 

But as they continued the 
search, the signals followed them. 
It became apparent that the outer 
periphery of the asteroid had 
been abandoned; the tribe had 
withdrawn to the center. Then, 
far down a shaft wrought of 
beaten aluminum, a hatch 
opened, light blazed forth, and 
J $ seph appeared in an ancient 
soacesuit fashioned of glass- 
cloth. He stood in the clumsy 
sack, his devil-face staring, his 
hands clutched in supplication, 
his devil-mouth making motions. 

Foyle stared at the old man, 
took a step toward him and then 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



121 




stopped, fists clenched, throat 
working as fury arose within him. 
And Jisbella, looking at Foyle, 
cried out in horror. The old tat- 
tooing had returned to his face, 
blood-red against the pallor of 
the skin, scarlet instead of black, 
truly a tiger mask in color as well 
as design. 

“Gully!” she cried. “Your face!” 
Foyle ignored her and stood 
glaring at J 5 seph while the old 
man made beseeching gestures, 
motioned to them to enter the 
interior of the asteroid, and then 
disappeared. Only then did Foyle 
turn to Jisbella and ask: “What? 
What did you say?” 

Through the clear globe of the 
helmet, she could see his face dis- 
tinctly. And as the rage within 
Foyle died away, Jisbella saw the 
blood-red tattooing fade and dis- 
appear. 

“Did you see that joker?” 
Foyle said. “That was J S seph. 
Did you see him begging and 
pleading after what he did to 
me? . What did you say?” 
“Your face, Gully. I know 
what’s happened to your face.” 
“What are you talking about?” 
“You wanted something that 
would control you, Gully. Well, 
you’ve got it. Your face. It — ” Jis- 
bella began to laugh hysterically. 
“You’ll have to learn control now, 
Gully. You’ll never be able to 
give way to emotion — any emo- 
tion — because — ” 



13 UT he was staring past her 
and suddenly he shot up the 
aluminum shaft with a yell. He 
jerked to a stop before an open 
door and began to whoop in tri- 
umph. The door opened into a 
tool locker, four by four by nine. 
There were shelves in the locker 
and a jumble of old provisions 
and discarded containers. It was 
Foyle’s coffin aboard the Nomad. 

J $ seph and his People had 
succeeded in sealing the wreck 
into their asteroid before the 
holocaust of Foyle’s escape had 
rendered further work impossible. 
The interior of the ship was vir- 
tually untouched. Foyle took Jis- 
bella’s arm and dragged her on 
a quick tour of the ship and fi- 
nally to the purser’s locker, where 
Foyle tore at the windrows of 
wreckage and debris until he dis- 
closed a massive steel face, blank 
and impenetrable. 

“We’ve got a choice,” he 
panted. “Either we tear the safe 
out of the hull and carry it back 
to Terra where we can work on 
it, or we open it here. I vote for 
here. Maybe Dagenham was ly- 
ing. All depends on what tools 
Sam has in the Weekender, any- 
way. Come back to the ship, Jiz.” 

He never noticed her silence 
and preoccupation until they 
were back aboard the Weekender 
and he had finished his urgent 
search for tools. 

“Nothing!” he snarled impa- 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




tiently. “There isn’t a hammer or 
a drill aboard. Nothing but gadg- 
ets for opening bottles and ra- 
tions.” 

Jisbella didn’t answer. She 
didn’t take her eyes off his face. 

“Why are you staring at me 
like that?” Foyle demanded. 

“I’m fascinated,” Jisbella an- 
swered slowly. 

“By what?” 

“I’m going to show you some- 
thing, Gully.” 

“What?” 

“How much I despise you.” 

Jisbella slapped him twice. 
Stung by the blows, Foyle started 
up in fury. Jisbella picked up a 
hand mirror and held it before 
him. 

“Look at yourself. Gully,” she 
said quietly. “Look at your face.” 

He looked. He saw the old tat- 
too marks flaming blood-red un- 
der the skin, turning his face into 
a scarlet and white tiger mask. 
He was so chilled by the appall- 
ing spectacle that his rage died 
at once — and the mask disap- 
peared just as swiftly. 

“Lord!” he whispered. “Lord, 
Lord!” 

“I had to make you lose your 
temper to show you,” Jisbella 
said. 

“What’s it mean, Jiz? Did 
Baker goof the job?” 

“I don’t think so. I think you’ve 
got scars under the skin. Gully — 
first from the tattooing and then 



from the bleaching. Needle scars. 
They don’t show normally, but 
they do when your emotions take 
over and your heart begins pump- 
ing blood . when you’re furi- 
ous or frightened or passionate 
or possessed. Do you under- 
stand?” 

XJE shook his head, still 
staring at his face, touching 
it in bewilderment. 

“You said you wished you 
could carry me in your pocket to 
stick pins in you when you lose 
control. You’ve got something 
better than that. Gully, or worse, 
poor darling. You’ve got your 
face.” 

“No!” he said. “No!” 

“You can’t ever lose control. 
Gully. You’ll never be able to 
drink too much, eat too much, 
love too much, hate too much. 
You’ll have to hold yourself with 
an iron grip.” 

“No!” he insisted desperately. 
“It can be fixed. Baker can do it, 
or somebody else. I can’t walk 
around afraid to feel anything 
because it’ll turn me into a 
freak!” 

“I don’t think this can be 
fixed. Gully.” 

“Skin-graft.” 

“The scars are too deep for 
graft. You’ll never get rid of this 
stigmata. Gully. You’ll have to 
learn to live with it.” 

Foyle flung the mirror from 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



123 




him in sudden rage, and again 
the blood-red mask dared up un- 
der his skin. He lunged out of the 
main cabin to the main hatch, 
where he pulled his "spacesuit 
down and began to squirm into 
it. 

“Gully! Where are you going? 
What are you going to do?” 

“Get tools,” he shouted. “Tools 
for the safe.” 

“Where?” 

“In the asteroid. They’ve got 
dozens of warehouses stuffed with 
tools from wrecked ships. There 
have to be drills there; every- 
thing I need. Don’t come with 
me. There may be trouble. How 
is my lousy face now? Showing 
it? I hope there is trouble!” 

He corked his suit and went 
into the asteroid. He found a 
hatch separating the inhabited 
core from the outer void. He 
banged on the door. He waited 
and banged again until at last 
the hatch was opened. Arms 
reached out and yanked him in, 
and the hatch was closed behind 
him. It had no airlock. 

He blinked in the light and 
scowled at J 3 seph and his inno- 
cent People gathering before him, 
their faces hideously decorated. 
And he knew that his own face 
must be flaming red and white, 
for he saw J S seph start, and he 
saw the devil-mouth shape the 
syllables : 

Nomad. 



^OYLE strode through the 
crowd, scattering them bru- 
tally. He smashed J $ seph with a 
backhand blow from his gaimt- 
leted fist. He searched through 
the inhabited corridors, recogniz- 
ing them dimly, and he came at 
last to the chamber, half natural 
cave, half antique hull, where the 
tools were stored. 

He rooted and ferreted, gath- 
ering up drills, diamond bits, 
acids, thermites, dynamite jel- 
lies, fiises. In the gently revolving 
asteroid, the gross weight of the 
equipment was reduced to less 
than a hundred pounds. He 
lumped it into a mass, roughly 
bound it together with cable and 
started out of the store-cave. 

J $ seph and his Scientific Peo- 
ple were waiting for him, like 
fleas waiting for a wolf. They 
darted at him and he battered 
through them, harried, delighted, 
savage. The armor of his space- 
suit protected him from their at- 
tacks and he went down the pas- 
sages searching for a hatch that 
would lead out into the void. 

Jisbella’s voice came to him, 
tinny on the earphones and agi- 
tated: “Gully, can you hear me? 
This is Jiz. Gully, listen to me.” 

“Go ahead.” 

“Another ship came up two 
minutes ago. It’s drifting on the 
other side of the asteroid." 

“What!” 

“It’s marked with yellow and 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




black colors, like a hornet” 
“Dagenham’s colors!” 

“Then we’ve been followed.” 
“Dagenham’s probably had a 
fix on me ever since we busted 
out of Gouffre Martel. I was 
a fool not to think of it. We’ve 
got to work fast, Jiz. Cork up in 
a suit and meet me aboard No- 
mad. The purser’s room. Go, girl!” 
“But, Gully-” 

“Sign off. They may be moni- 
toring our waveband. Go!” 

He drove through the asteroid, 
reached a barred hatch, broke 
through the guard before it 
smashed it open and went into 
the void of the outer passages. 
The Scientific People were too 
desperate getting the hatch closed 
to stop him. But he knew they 
would follow him; they were 
raging. 

He hauled the bulk of his 
equipment through twists and 
turns to the wreck of the Nomad. 
Jisbella was waiting for him in 
the purser’s room. 

Che made a move to turn on 
her micro-wave set and Foyle 
stopped her. He placed his helmet 
against hers and shouted: “No 
short-wave. They’ll be monitoring 
and they’ll locate us by D/F. 
You can hear me like this, can’t 
you?” 

She nodded. 

“All right. We’ve got maybe an 
hour before Dagenham finds us. 



We’ve got maybe an hour before 
J $ seph and his mob come after 
us. We’re in a hell of a jam. We’ve 
got to work fast. 

She nodded again. 

“No time to open the safe and 
transport the bullion.” 

“If it’s there.” 

“Dagenham’s here, isn’t he? 
That’s proof it’s there. We’ll have 
to cut the whole safe out of the 
Nomad and get it into the Week- 
ender. Then we blast.” 

“But-” 

“Just listen to me and do what 
I say. Go back to the Weekender. 
Empty it out. Jettison everything 
we don’t need — all supplies ex- 
cept emergency rations.” 

“Why?” 

“Because I don’t know how 
many tons this safe weighs and 
the ship may not be able to han- 
dle it when we come back to 
gravity. We’ve got to make allow- 
ances in advance. It’ll mean a 
tough trip back, but it’s worth it. 
Strip the ship. Fast! Go, girl. Go!” 
He pushed her away and, with- 
out another glance in her direc- 
tion, attacked the safe. It was 
built into the structural steel of 
the hull, a massive metal ball 
some four feet in diameter. It 
was welded to the strakes and 
ribs of the Nomad at twelve dif- 
ferent spots. Foyle hit each weld 
in turn with acids, drills, thermite 
and refrigerants. He was operat- 
ing on the theory of structural

125 




strain— to heat, free 2 e and etch 
the steel until its crystalline struc- 
ture was distorted and its physi- 
cal strength destroyed. He was 
fatiguing the metal. 

Jisbella returned and he real- 
ized that forty-five minutes had 
passed. He was dripping and 
shaking, but the globe of the safe 
hung free of the hull with a 
dozen rough knobs protruding 
from its surface. Foyle motioned 
urgently to Jisbella and she 
strained her weight against the 
safe with him. They could not 
budge its mass together. 

As they sank back in exhaus- 
tion and despair, a quick shadow 
eclipsed the sunlight pouring 
through the rents in the Nomad 
hull. They stared up. 

A spaceship was circling the 
asteroid less than a quarter of a 
mile off. 

PpOYLE placed his helmet 
against Jisbella’s. “Dagen- 
ham,” he gasped. “Looking for us. 
Probably got a crew down here 
combing for us, too. Soon as they 
talk to J 3 seph, they’ll be here.” 

“Oh, Gully!” 

“We’ve still got a chance. 
Maybe they won’t spot Sam’s 
Weekender until they’ve made a 
couple of revolutions. It’s hidden 
in that crater. Maybe we can get 
the safe aboard in the meantime.” 

“How?” 

“I don’t know, damn it! I don’t 



know.” He pounded his fists to- 
gether in frustration. “I’m fin- 
ished.” 

“Couldn’t we blast it out?” 

“Blast? Bombs instead of 
brains? Is this Mental McQueen 
speaking?” 

“Listen. Blast it with something 
explosive. That would act like a 
rocket jet — give it a thrust.” 

“But then what? How do we 
get it into the ship, Jiz? Can’t 
keep on blasting. Haven’t got 
time.” 

“No, we bring the ship to the 
safe.” 

“What?” 

“Blast the safe straight out into 
space. Then bring the ship arovind 
and let the safe sail right into the 
main hatch. Like catching a ball 
in your hat. See?” 

He saw. “Hey, we can do it!”- 
Foyle leaped to the pile of equip- 
ment and began sorting out sticks 
of dynamite gelatine, fuses and 
caps. 

“We’ll have to use the short- 
wave. One of us stays with the 
safe; one of us pilots the ship. 
One with the safe talks the one 
with the ship into position. 
Right?” 

“Right. You’d better pilot. 
Gully. I’ll do the talking.” 

He nodded, fixing explosive to 
the face of the safe, attaching 
caps and fuses. Then he placed 
his helmet against hers. “Vacuum 
fuses, Jiz. Timed for two min- 



us 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




utes. When I give the word by 
short-wave, just pull off the fuse 
heads and get out of the way. 
Right?” 

“Right.” 

“Stay with the safe. Once 
you’ve talked it into the ship, 
come right after it. Don’t wait 
for anything. It’s going to be 
close.” 

He thumped her shoulder and 
returned to the Weekender. He 
left the outer hatch open, and 
the inner door of the airlock as 
well. The ship’s air puffed out 
immediately. Airless and stripped 
by Jisbella, it looked dismal and 
forlorn. 

Foyle went directly to the con- 
trols, sat down and switched on 
his micro-wave set. “Stand by. 
I’m coming out now.” 

TJE IGNITED the jets, blew 
the laterals for three sec- 
onds and then the forwards. The 
Weekender lifted easily, shaking 
debris from her back and sides 
like a whale surfacing. 

As she slid up and back, Foyle 
called: “Dynamite, Jiz! Now!” 

There was no blast; there was 
no flash. In the silence of space, 
a new crater opened in the aster- 
oid below him and a flower of 
rubble sprang upward, rapidly 
outdistancing a dull steel ball that 
followed leisurely, turning in a 
lazy spin. 

“Ease off.” Jisbella’s voice came 



cold and competent over the ear- 
phones. “You’re backing too fast. 
And incidentally, trouble’s ar- 
rived.” 

He braked with the rear jets, 
looking down in alarm. The sur- 
face of the asteroid was covered 
with a swarm of hornets. They 
were Dagenham’s crew in yellow 
and black banded spacesuits. 
They were buzzing around a sin- 
gle figure in white that dodged 
and spun and eluded them. It was 
Jisbella. 

“Steady as you go,” Jiz said 
quietly, although he could hear 
how hard she was breathing. 
“Ease off a little more . Roll a 
quarter turn.” 

He obeyed her almost automa- 
tically, still watching the struggle 
below. The flank of the Week- 
ender cut off any view of the 
trajectory of the safe as it ap- 
proached him, but he could still 
see Jisbella and Dagenham’s 
men. 

She ignited her suit rocket — 
he saw the tiny spurt of flame 
shoot out from her back — and 
came sailing up from the surface 
of the asteroid. A score of flames 
burst out from the backs of Dag- 
enham’s men as they followed. 
Half a dozen dropped the pursuit 
of Jisbella and came up after the 
Weekender. 

“It’s going to be close. Gully.” 
Jisbella was panting now, but 
her voice was still calm. “Dagen-

The hornets closed in and en- “Come on, Jiz! Come on!” 
gulfed the tiny white suit. Foyle howled. “Come, girl! 

“Foyle! Can you hear me? Come!”

in fuzzily and finally cleared, sight behind the flank of the

“Jiz! Jiz! Can you get clear “Foyle! Will you answer me? 
of them?” This is Dagenham speaking.” 

“Hold your position. Gully . “Speak your head off, Dagen- 
There she goes! It’s a hole in one, ham,” Foyle shouted. “Give me 
son!” 

A CRUSHING shock racked 
the Weekender as the safe, 
moving slowly but massively, 

rammed into the main hatch. At 








the word when you’re aboard, 
Jiz, and hold on.” 

“I can’t make it, Gully.” 

“Come on, girl!” 

“I can’t get aboard. The safe’s 
blocking the hatch. It’s wedged 
in halfway.” 

“Jiz!” 

“There’s no way in, I tell you,” 
she cried in despair. “I’m blocked 
out.” 

He stared around wildly. Dag- 
enham’s men were boarding the 
hull of the Weekender with the 
menacing purpose of professional 
raiders. Dagenham’s ship was 
lifting over the brief horizon of 
the asteroid on a dead course for 
him. 



“Foyle, you’re finished. You 
and the girl. But I’ll offer a 
deal . .” 

“Gully, help me!” 

“Forga,” Foyle said in a stran- 
gled voice. He closed his eyes 
and tripped the controls. The tail 
jets roared. The Weekender 
shook and shuddered forward. It 
broke free of Dagenham’s board- 
ers, of Jisbella, of warnings and 
pleas. It pressed Foyle back into 
the pilot’s chair with the black- 
out of lOG acceleration, an accel- 
eration that was less pressing, less 
painful, less treacherous than the 
passion that drove him. 

And as he passed from sight, 
there rose up on his face the 
blood-red stigmata of his posses-

With a burning spear and a horse

To the wilderness I wander.

Ten leagues beyond the wide

Methinks it is no journey. 

Tom-a-Bedlam 

^'pHE old year soured as pesti- 
lence poisoned the planets. 
The war gained momentum and 
grew from a distant affair of ro- 
mantic raids and skirmishes in 
space to a holocaust in the mak- 
ing. 

It soon became evident that the 
last of the World Wars was done 
and the first of the Solar Wars 
had begun. 

The belligerents slowly massed 
men and materiel for the havoc. 
The Outer Satellites introduced 
universal conscription and the In- 
ner Planets perforce followed 
suit. Industries, trades, sciences, 
skills and professions were 
drafted; regulations and oppres- 
sions followed. The armies and 
navies requisitioned and com- 
manded. 

Commerce obeyed, for this was 
the shooting phase of a commer- 
cial struggle. But populations re- 
belled and dr aft- jaunting and la- 
bor-jaunting became critical 
problems. Spy scares and invasion 

130 



scares spread. The hysterical be- 
came informers and lynchers. An 
ominous foreboding paralyzed 
every home from Baffin Island to 
the Falklands. The dying year 
was enlivened only by the advent 
of the Four Mile Circus. 

This was the popular nickname 
for the grotesque entourage of 
Geoffrey Fourmyle of Ceres, a 
wealthy young buffoon from the 
largest of the asteroids. Fourmyle 
of Ceres was enormously rich; he 
was also enormously amusing. He 
was the classic nouveau riche of 
all time. His entourage was a 
cross between a country circus 
and the comic court of a Bulga- 
rian kinglet, as witness this typi- 
cal arrival in Green Bay, Wis- 
consin. 

Early in the morning, a lawyer, 
wearing the stovepipe hat of a 
legal clan, appeared with a list 
of camp sites in his hand and a 
small fortune in his pocket. He 
settled on a four-acre meadow 
facing Lake Michigan and rented 
it for an exorbitant fee. 

He was followed by a gang of 
surveyors from the Mason & 
Dixon clan. In twenty minutes, 
the surveyors had laid out a camp 
site and the word had spread 
that the Four Mile Circus was 
arriving. Locals from Wisconsin, 
Michigan and Minnesota came to 
watch the fun. 

Twenty roustabouts jaunted in, 
each carrying a tent-pack on his 

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




back. There was a mighty over- 
ture of bawled orders, shouts, 
curses, and the tortured scream of 
compressed air. Twenty giant 
tents ballooned upward, their lac 
and latex surfaces gleaming as 
they dried in the winter sun. The 
spectators cheered. 

A SIX-MOTOR helicopter 
drifted down and hovered 
over a giant trampoline. Its belly 
opened and a cascade of furnish- 
ings came down. Servants, valets, 
chefs and waiters jaunted in. 
They furnished and decorated the 
tents. The kitchens began smok- 
ing and the odor of frying, broil- 
ing and baking pervaded the 
camp. Fourmyle’s private police 
were already on duty, patrolling 
the four acres, keeping back the 
huge crowd of spectators. 

Then by plane, by car, by bus, 
by truck, by bike and by jaunte 
came Fourmyle’s entourage. Li- 
brarians and books, scientists and 
laboratories, philosophers, poets, 
athletes. Racks of swords and 
sabers were set up and judo mats 
and a boxing ring. A fifty-foot 
pool was sunk in the ground and 
filled by pump from the lake. An 
interesting altercation arose be- 
tween two beefy athletes as to 
whether the pool should be 
warmed for swimming or frozen 
for skating. 

Musicians, actors, jugglers and 
acrobats arrived. The uproar be- 



came deafening. A crew of me- 
chanics melted a grease-pit and 
began revving up Fourmyle’s col- 
lection of vintage diesel harvest- 
ers. Last of all came the camp 
followers: wives, daughters, mis- 
tresses, whores, beggars, chiselers 
and grafters. 

At noon, Fourmyle of Ceres ar- 
rived with a display of conspicu- 
ous transportation so outlandish 
that it had been known to make 
seven-year melancholics laugh. A 
giant amphibian thrummed up 
from the south and landed on the 
lake. A landing barge emerged 
from the plane and droned across 
the water to the shore. Its for- 
ward wall banged down into a 
drawbridge and out came a 20th 
century staff car. Wonder piled 
on wonder for the delighted spec- 
tators, for the staff car drove a 
matter of twenty yards to the 
center of camp and then stopped. 

“What can possibly come next? 
Bike?” 

“No, roller-skates.” 

“He’ll come out on a pogo- 
stick.” 

■pOURMYLE capped their 
^ wildest speculations. The 
muzzle of a circus cannon thrust 
up from the staff car. There was 
the bang of a black-powder ex- 
plosion and Fourmyle of Ceres 
was shot out of the cannon in a 
graceful arc to the very door of 
his tent, where he was caught in 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



131 




a net by four valets. The ap- 
plause that greeted him could be 
heard for six miles. Fourmyle 
climbed onto his valets’ shoulders 
and motioned for silence. 

“Friends, Romans, Country- 
men,” Fourmyle began earnestly, 
“Lend me your ears. Shake- 
speare. 1564-1616. Damn!” Four 
white doves shook themselves out 
of Fourmyle’s sleeves and flut- 
tered away. 

He regarded them with aston- 
ishment, then continued. “Greet- 
ings, salutations, bonjour, bon ton, 
bon vivant, bon voyage, bon — 
What the hell?” Fourmyle’s pock- 
ets caught fire and rocketed forth 
Roman candles. He tried to put 
himself out. Streamers and con- 
fetti burst from him. “Friends . 
Shut up! I’ll get this speech 
straight. Quiet! Friends—” 

Fourmyle looked down at him- 
self in dismay. His clothes were 
melting away, revealing lurid 
scarlet underwear. 

“Kleinmann!” he bellowed 
angrily. “Kleinmann! What’s hap- 
pened to your hypno-training?” 

A hairy head thrust out of a 
tent. “You stoodied for dis sbeech 
last night, Fourmyle?” 

“You bet I stoodied. For two 
hours, I stoodied. Never took my 
head out of the hypno-oven. 
Kleinmann on Prestidigitation.” 
“No, no, no!” the hairy man 
bawled. “How many times must 
I tell you? Prestidigitation is not 



sbeech-making. Is magic. Dutnb- 
kopf! You haff the wrong hypno- 
sis taken!” 

The scarlet underwear began 
melting. Fourmyle toppled from 
the shoulders of his shaking val- 
ets and disappeared within his 
tent. There was a roar of laugh- 
ter and cheering and the Four 
Mile Circus ripped into high gear. 
The kitchens sizzled and smoked. 
There was a perpetuity of eating 
and drinking. The music never 




132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



stopped. The vaudeville never 
ceased. 

Inside his tent, Fourmyle 
changed his clothes, changed his 
mind, changed again, undressed 
again, kicked his valets and 
called for his tailor in a bastard 
tongue of French, Mayfair and 
affectation. Halfway into a new 
suit, he recollected he had neg- 
lected to bathe. He slapped his 
tailor, ordered ten gallons of scent 
to be decanted into the pool, and 



was stricken with poetic inspira- 
tion. He summoned his resident 
poet. 

“Take this down,” Fourmyle 
commanded. “Le roi est mort, 
les— Wait. What rhymes with 
Moon?” 

“June,” his poet suggested. 
“Croon, soon, dune, loon, noon, 
rune, tune, boon . .” 

“I forgot my experiment!” 
Fourmyle exclaimed. “Dr. Bo- 
hunl Dr. Bohun!” 





Half-naked, he rushed pell-mell 
into the laboratory, where he 
blew himself and Dr. Bohun, his 
resident chemist, halfway across 
the tent. As the chemist attempted 
to raise himself from the floor, 
he found himself seized in a most 
painful and embarrassing stran- 
glehold. 

“Nogouchi!” Fourmyle shouted. 
“Hi, Nogouchi! I just invented a 
new judo hold!” 

TTE stood up, lifted the suf- 
focating chemist and jaunted 
to the judo mat, where the little 
Japanese inspected the hold and 
shook his head. 

“No, please.” He hissed po- 
litely. “Pressure on windpipe are 
not perpetually lethal. I show 
you, please.” He seized the dazed 
chemist, whirled him and depos- 
ited him on the mat in a position 
of unbreakable self-strangulation. 
“You observe, please, Fourmyle?” 

But Fourmyle was in the li- 
brary bludgeoning his librarian 
over the head with Bloch’s Das 
Sexual Leben (eight pounds, 
nine ounces) because that un- 
happy man could produce no text 
on the manufacture of perpetual- 
motion machines. 

He rushed to his physics lab- 
oratory, where he destroyed an 
expensive chronometer to experi- 
ment with cog wheels, jaunted to 
the bandstand, where he seized a 
baton and led the orchestra into 

134 



confusion, put on skates and fell 
into the scented swimming pool, 
was hauled out, swearing fulmi- 
nously at the lack of ice. 

“I wish to commute with my- 
self,” Fourmyle said, kicking his 
valets in all directions. He was 
snoring before the last of them 
limped to the door and closed it 
behind him. 

The snoring stopped and Foyle 
arose. “That ought to hold them 
for today,” he muttered, and went 
into his dressing room. He stood 
before a mirror, took a deep 
breath and held it, meanwhile 
watching his face. At the expira- 
tion of one minute, it was still un- 
marred. He continued to hold his 
breath, maintaining rigid control 
over pulse and muscle, mastering 
the strain with iron calm. At two 
minutes and twenty seconds, the 
stigmata appeared, blood-red. 

Foyle let out his breath. The 
tiger mask faded. 

“Better,” he murmured. “Much 
better. The old fakir was right — 
Yoga is the answer. Control. 
Pulse, breath, bowels, brains.” 

He stripped and examined his 
body. He was in magnificent con- 
dition, but his skin still showed 
delicate silver seams in a network 
from neck to ankles. It looked as 
though someone had carved an 
outline of the nervous system into 
Foyle’s flesh. The silver seams 
were the scars of an operation 
that had not yet faded. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




T^HAT operation had cost a 
Cr 200,000 bribe to the chief 
surgeon of the Mars Commando 
Brigade and had transformed 
Foyle into an extraordinary fight- 
ing machine. Every nerve plexus 
had been rewired, microscopic 
transistors and transformers had 
been buried in muscle and bone, 
a minute platinum outlet showed 
at the base of his spine. To this, 
Foyle affixed a power-pack the 
size of a pea and switched it on. 
His body began an internal elec- 
tronic vibration that was almost 
mechanical. 

“More machine than man,” he 
thought. He dressed, rejected the 
extravagant apparel of Fourmyle 
of Ceres for the anonymous black 
coverall of action. 

He jaunted to Robin Wednes- 
bury’s apartment in the lonely 
building amidst the Wisconsin 
pines. It was the real reason for 
the advent of the Four Mile Cir- 
cus in Green Bay. He jaunted and 
arrived in darkness and empty 
space and immediately plum- 
meted down. 

“Wrong coordinates?” he 
thought. “Misjaunted?” 

The broken end of a rafter 
dealt him a bruising blow and he 
landed heavily on a shattered 
floor upon the putrefying remains 
of a corpse. 

Foyle leaped up in calm revul- 
sion. He pressed hard with his 
tongue against his right upper 



first molar. The operation that 
had transformed half his body 
into an electronic machine had 
set the control switchboard in his 
teeth. Foyle pressed a tooth with 
his tongue and the peripheral 
cells of his retina were excited 
into emitting a soft light. He 
looked down two pale beams at 
the corpse of a man. 

The corpse lay in the apart- 
ment below Robin Wednesbury’s 
flat. It was gutted. Foyle looked 
up. Above him was a ten-foot 
hole where the floor of Robin’s 
living room had been. The entire 
building stank of fire, smoke and 
rot. 

“Jacked,” Foyle said softly. 
“This place has been jacked. 
What happened?” 

The jaunting age had crystal- 
lized the hoboes, tramps and 
vagabonds of the world into a 
new class. They followed the 
night from east to west, always in 
darkness, always in search of 
loot, the leavings of disaster, car- 
rion. If earthquake shattered a 
warehouse, they were jacking it 
the following night. If fire opened 
a house or explosion split the de- 
fenses of a shop, they jaunted in 
and scavenged. They called 
themselves Jack-jaunters. They 
were jackals. 

Foyle climbed up through the 
wreckage to the corridor on the 
floor above. The Jack-jaunters 
had a camp there. A whole calf 



THE STARS MY DESTINATION 



135 




roasted before a fire which 
sparked up to the sky through a 
gash in the roof. There were a 
dozen men and three women 
around the fire, rough, dangerous, 
jabbering in the rhyming slang 
of the jackals. They were dressed 
in mismatched clothes and drink- 
ing potato beer from champagne 
glasses. 

A n ominous growl of anger 
and terror met Foyle’s ap- 
pearance as the big man in black 
came up through the rubble, his 
intent eyes emitting pale beams 
of light. Calmly, he strode 
through the rising mob to the 
entrance of Robin Wednesbury’s 
flat. His iron control gave him an 
air of detachment. 

“If she’s dead,” he thought, “I’m 
finished. I’ve got to use her. But 
if she’s dead . .” 

Robin’s apartment was gutted 
like the rest of the building. The 
living room was an oval of floor 
around the jagged hole in the 
center. Foyle searched for a body. 
Two men and a woman were in 
the bed in the bedroom. The men 
cursed. The woman shrieked at 
the apparition. The men hurled 
themselves at Foyle. 

He backed a step and pressed 
his tongue against his upper in- 
cisors. Neural circuits buzzed and 
every sense and response in his 
body was accelerated by a ratio 
of five. 

136 



The effect’ was an instantane- 
ous reduction of the external 
world to extreme slow motion. 
Sound became a deep garble. 
Color 'shifted down the spectrum 
toward the red. The two assail- 
ants seemed to float toward him 
with dreamlike languor. 

To the rest of the world, Foyle 
became a blur of action. He side- 
stepped the blow inching toward 
him, walked around the man, 
raised him and threw him toward 
the crater in the living room. He 
threw the second man after the 
first jackal. To Foyle’s acceler- 
ated senses, their bodies seemed 
to drift slowly, still in mid-stride, 
fists inching forward, open mouths 
slowly burbling heavy clotted 
sounds. 

Foyle whipped around to the 
woman cowering in the bed. 

“Wsthrabdy?” the blur asked. 

The woman shrieked. 

Foyle pressed his upper inci- 
sors again, cutting off the accel- 
eration. The external world shook 
itself out of slow motion back to 
normal. Sound and color leaped 
up the spectrum and the two 
jackals disappeared through the 
crater and crashed into the apart- 
ment below. 

“Was there a body?” Foyle re- 
peated gently. “ A beautiful Negro 
girl?” 

The woman was unintelligible. 
He took her by the hair and 
shook her, then hurled her 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




through the crater in the living 
room floor. 

His search for a clue to Rob- 
in’s fate was interrupted by the 
mob from the hall. They carried 
torches and makeshift weapons. 
The Jack-jaimters were not pro- 
fessional killers. They only wor- 
ried defenseless prey to death. 

“Don’t bother me,” Foyle 
warned quietly, ferreting intently 
through closets. 

^^HEY edged closer, goaded by 
a ruffian in a mink suit and a 
tricorne hat, and inspired by the 
curses percolating up from the 
floor below. The man in the tri- 
corne threw a torch at Foyle. 

Foyle accelerated again and 
the Jack-jaunters were trans- 
formed into living statues. Foyle 
picked up half a chair and calmly 
clubbed the slow-motion figures. 
They remained upright. He thrust 
the man in the tricorne down on 
the floor and knelt on him. Then 
he decelerated. 

Again the external world came 
to life. The jackals dropped in 
their tracks, pole-axed. The man 
in the tricorne hat and mink suit 
roared. 

“Was there a body in here?” 
Foyle asked. “Negro girl. Very 
tall. Very beautiful.” 

The man writhed and at- 
tempted to gouge Foyle’s eyes. 

“You keep track of bodies,” 
Foyle said. “Some of you Jacks 



like dead girls better than live 
here?” 

ones. Did you find her body in 

Receiving no satisfactory an- 
swer, he picked up a torch and set 
fire to the mink suit. He followed 
the Jack-jaunter into the living 
room and watched him with de- 
tached interest. The man howled, 
toppled over the edge of the 
crater and flamed down into the 
darkness below. 

“Was there a body?” Foyle 
called down. He shook his head 
at the answer. “Not very deft,” he 
grumbled at himself. “I’ve got to 
learn how to extract information. 
Dagenham could teach me a 
thing or two.” 

He poured water down on the 
man and put out the fire. Then he 
switched off his electronic system 
and jaunted. 

He appeared in Green Bay, 
smelling so abominably of singed 
hair and scorched skin that he 
entered the local Presteign shop 
(jewels, perfumes, cosmetics, ion- 
ics & surrogates) to buy a deodor- 
ant. But the local Mr. Presto had 
evidently witnessed the arrival of 
the Four Mile Circus and recog- 
nized him. 

Foyle at once snapped out of 
his detached intensity and be- 
came the outlandish Fourmyle of 
Ceres. He clowned and cavorted, 
bought a twelve-ounce flagon of 
Euge No. 5 at Cr 100 an ounce, 
dabbed himself delicately and 



THE STARS MY DESTINATtON 



137 




tossed the bottle into the street 
to the edification and delight of 
Mr. Presto. 

The Record Clerk at the 
County Record office was un- 
aware of Foyle’s identity and ob- 
durate and uncompromising. 

“No, sir. County Records Are 
not Viewed Without Proper Court 
Order for Sufficient Cause. That 
Must Be Final.” 

Foyle examined him keenly 
and without rancor. “Asthenic 
type,” he decided. “Slender, long- 
boned, no strength. Epileptoid 
character. Self-centered, pedantic, 
single-minded, shallow. Not brib- 
able; too repressed and strait- 
laced. But repression’s the chink 
in his armor.” 

A N HOUR later, six followers 
from the Four Mile Circus 
waylaid the Record Clerk. They 
were of the female persuasion 
and richly endowed with vice. 
Two hours later, the Record 
Clerk, dazed by flesh and the 
devil, delivered up his informa- 
tion. The apartment building had 
been opened to Jack-jaunting by 
a gas explosion two weeks ear- 
lier. All tenants had been forced 
to move. Robin Wednesbury was 
in protective confinement in 
Mercy Hospital near the Iron 
Mountain Proving Grounds. 

“Protective confinement?” Foyle 
wondered. “What for? What’s she 
done?” 



It took thirty minutes to or- 
ganize a Christmas Party in the 
Four Mile Circus. It was made up 
of musicians, singers, actors and 
rabble who knew the Iron Moun- 
tain coordinates. Led by their 
chief buffoon, they jatinted up 
with music, fireworks, firewater, 
and gifts. They paraded through 
the town spreading largess and 
laughter. They blundered into the 
radar field of the Proving Ground 
protection system and were 
driven out with laughter. 

Forumyle of Ceres, dressed as 
Santa Claus, scattering banknotes 
from a huge sack over his shoul- 
der and leaping in agony as the 
induction field of the protection 
system burned his bottom, made 
an entrancing spectacle. 

They burst into Mercy Hospi- 
tal, following Santa Claus, who 
roared and cavorted with the de- 
tached calm of a solemn ele- 
phant. He kissed the nurses, 
made drunk the attendants, pes- 
tered the patients with gifts, lit- 
tered the corridors with money, 
and abruptly disappeared when 
the happy rioting reached such 
heights that the police had to be 
called. 

Much later, it was discovered 
that a patient had disappeared, 
too, despite the fact that she had 
been under sedation and was in- 
capable of jaunting. As a matter 
of fact, she had departed from 
the hospital inside Santa’s sack. 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




brought along for that purpose. 

Foyle jaunted with her over 
his shoulder to the hospital 
grounds. There, in a quiet grove 
of pines under a frosty sky, he 
helped her out of the sack. She 
wore severe white hospital paja- 
mas and was beautiful. He re- 
moved his own costume, watch- 
ing the girl intently, waiting to 
see if she would recognize and 
remember him. 

She was alarmed and confused; 
her telesending was like heat- 
lightning: “Who is he? What’s 
happened? The music. The up- 
roar. Why kidnaped in a sack? 
Drunks slurring on trombones. 
‘Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa 
Claus.’ Adeste Fidelis. What’s he 
want from me? Who is he?” 
“I’m Fourmyle of Ceres,” Foyle 
said. 

Who? Fourmyle 
” of— ? Yes, of course. The 
buffoon. The bourgeoise gentil- 
homme. Vulgarity. Imbecility. 
Obscenity. The Four Mile Circus. 
My God! Am I telesending? Can 
you hear me?” 

“I hear you. Miss Wednes- 
bury,” Foyle said quietly. 

“What have you done? Why? 
What do you want with me? I — ” 
“I want you to look at me.” 
“Bonjour, Madame. Into my 
sack, Madame. Ecco! Look at me. 
I’m looking,” Robin said, trying 
to control the jangle of her 



thoughts. She gazed up into his 
face without recognition. “Itfs a 
face. I’ve seen so many like it. 
The features of masculinity. 
Everyman in rut. Will God never 
save us from brute desire?” 

“My rutting season’s over, Miss 
Wednesbury.” 

“I’m sorry you heard that. I’m 
terrified, naturally. I — You know 
me?” 

“I know you.” 

“We’ve met before?” She scru- 
tinized him closely, but still with- 
out recognition. Deep down in- 
side Foyle there was a surge of 
triumph. If this woman of all 
women failed to remember him, 
he was safe, provided he kept 
blood and brains and face under 
control. 

“We’ve never met,” he said. 
“I’ve heard of you. I want some- 
thing from you. That’s why we’re 
here — to talk about it. If you 
don’t like my offer, you can go 
back to the hospital.” 

“You want something? But I’ve 
got nothing. Nothing’s left but 
shame and —Why did the suicide 
fail? Why couldn’t I-” 

“So that’s it?” Foyle inter- 
ruoted softly. “You tried to com- 
mit suicide, eh? That accounts 
for the gas explosion that opened 
the building, and your protective 
confinement. Attempted suicide. 
Why weren’t you hurt in the ex- 
plosion?” 

“So many were hurt. So many

died. But I didn’t. I’m imlucky, I 
suppose. I’ve been unlucky all 
my life.” 

“Why suicide?” 

“I’m tired. I’m finished. I’ve 
lost everything . I’m on the 
army graylist . suspected, 
watched, reported. No job. No 
family. No— Why suicide? Dear 
God, what else but suicide?” 
“You can work for me.” 

“I can . What did you say?” 
“I want you to work for me, 
Miss Wednesbury.” 

^HE burst into hysterical 
laughter. “For you? Another 
camp-follower in the Circus? 
Work for you, Fourmyle?” 

“You’ve got sex on the brain,” 
he said gently. “I’m not looking 
for tarts. They look for me, as a 
rule.” 

“I’m sorry. I’m obsessed by the 
brute who destroyed me. I — I’ll 
try to make sense.” Robin calmed 
herself. “Let me understand you. 
You’ve taken me out of the hos- 
pital to offer me a job. You’ve 
heard of me. That means you 
want something special. My spe- 
cialty is telesending.” 

“And charm.” 

“What?” 

“I want to buy your charm, 
Miss Wednesbury.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“Why,” Foyle said mildly, “it 
ought to be simple for you. I’m 
the buffoon. I’m vulgarity, imbe- 



cility, obscenity. That’s got to 
stop. I want you to be my social 
secretary.” 

“You expect me to believe 
that? You could hire a hundred 
social secretaries ... a thousand, 
with your money. You expect me 
to believe that I’m the only one 
for you? That you had to kidnap 
me from protective confinement 
to get me?” 

Foyle nodded. “That’s right, 
there are thousands, but only one 
that can telesend.” 

“What’s that got to do with it?” 
“You’re going to be the ven- 
triloquist; I’m going to be your 
dummy. I don’t know the upper 
classes; you do. They have their 
own talk, their own jokes, their 
own manners. If a man wants to 
be accepted by them, he’s got to 
talk their language. I can’t, but 
you can. You’ll talk for me, 
through my mouth.” 

“But you could learn.” 

“It would take too long. And 
charm can’t be learned. I want 
to buy your charm. Miss Wednes- 
bury. Now about salary — I’ll pay 
you a thousand a month.” 

Her eyes widened. “You’re very 
generous, Fourmyle.” 

“I’ll clean up this suicide charge 
for you.” 

“You’re very kind.” 

“And I’ll guarantee to get you 
off the army graylist. You’ll be 
back on the whitelist by the time 
you finish working for me. You

can begin with a clean slate and 
a bonus. You can start living 
again.” 

^ OBIN’S lips trembled and 
then she began to cry. She 
sobbed and shook and Foyle had 
to steady her. 

“Well?” he asked. “Will you do 
it?” 

She nodded. “You’re so kind. 
It’s— I’m not used to kindness 
any more.” 

The dull concussion of a dis- 
tant explosion made Foyle stiffen. 
“Christ!” he exclaimed in sud- 
den panic. “Another Blue Jaunte. 

I-” 

“No,” Robin said. “I don’t 
know what Blue Jaunte is, but 
that’s the Proving Ground. 
They-” 

She looked up at Foyle’s face 
and screamed. The unexpected 
shock of the explosion and the 
vivid chain of associations had 
wrenched loose his iron control. 
The blood-red scars of tattooing 
showed under his skin. She stared 
at him in horror, still screaming. 

He touched his face once, then 
leaped forward, and gagged her. 
Once again he had hold of him- 
self. 

“It shows, eh?” he said with a 
ghastly smile. “Thought I was 
back in Gouffre Martel listening 
to a Blue Jaunte. Yes, I’m Foyle. 
The brute who destroyed you. 
You had to know, sooner or later. 



but I’d hoped it would be later. 
I’m Foyle, back again. Will you 
be quiet and listen to me?” 

She shook her head frantically, 
trying to struggle out of his grasp. 
With detached calm, he punched 
her jaw. Robin sagged. Foyle 
picked her up, wrapped her in his 
coat and held her in his arms, 
waiting for consciousness to re- 
turn. When he saw her eyelids 
flutter, he spoke again. 

“Don’t move or you’ll be sick. 
Maybe I didn’t pull that punch 
enough.” 

“Brute . Beast . .” 

“I could do this the wrong 
way,” he said. “I could blackmail 
you. I know your mother and sis- 
ters are on Callisto, that you’re 
classed as an alien belligerent by 
association. That puts you on the 
blacklist, ipso facto. Is that right? 
Ipso facto. ‘By the very fact.’ 
Latin. You can’t trust hypno- 
learning. I could point out that 
all I have to do is send anony- 
mous information to Central In- 
telligence and you wouldn’t be 
just suspect any more. They’d be 
ripping information out of you in- 
side twelve hours.” 

TTE felt her shudder. “But 
I’m not going to do it that 
way. I’m going to tell you the 
truth because I want to turn you 
into a partner. Your mother’s in 
the Inner Planets. She’s in the In- 
ner Planets,” he repeated. “She

may be right here on Earth.” 
“Safe?” she whispered. 

“I don’t know.” 

“Put me down.” 

“You’re cold.” 

“Put me down.” 

He set her on her feet. 

“You destroyed me once,” she 
said in choked tones. “Are you 
trying to destroy me again?” 
“No. Will you listen?” 

She nodded. 

“I was lost in space. I was 
dead and rotting for six months. 
A ship came up that could have 
saved me. It passed me by. It let 
me die. A ship named Vorga. 
VoT^a—T: 1339. Does that mean 
anything to you?” 

“No.” 

“Jiz McQueen — A friend of 
mine who’s dead now once told 
me to find out why I was left to 
rot. That would be the answer to 
who gave the order. So I started 
buying information about Vor^a. 
Any information.” 

“What’s that to do with my 
mother?” 

“Just listen. Information was 
tough to buy. The Vor^a records 
were removed from the Bo’ness & 
Uig files. I managed to locate 
three names . three out of a 
standard crew of four officers and 
twelve men. Nobody knew any- 
thing or nobody would talk. And 
I found this.” Foyle took a silver 
locket from his pocket and 
handed it to Robin. “It was

pawned by some spaceman off 
the Vor^a. That’s all I could find 
out.” 

Robin uttered a cry and opened 
the locket with trembling fingers. 
Inside were her picture and the 
pictures of two other girls. As the 
locket was opened, the 3D photos 
smiled and whispered: “Love 

from Robin, Mama . Love from 
Holly, Mama . Love from 
Wendy, Mama.” 

“It is my mother’s,” Robin 
wept. “It . She . For pity’s 
sake, where is she? What hapi- 
pened?” 

“I don’t know,” Foyle said 
steadily. “But I can guess. I think 
your mother got out of that con- 
centration camp . one way or 
another.” 

“And my sisters, too. She’d 
never leave them.” 

“Maybe your sisters, too. I 
think Vor^a was running refugees 
out of Callisto. Your family paid 
with money and jewelry to get 
aboard and be taken to the Inner 
Planets. That’s how a spaceman 
off the Vorga came to pawn this 
locket.” 

“Then where are they?” 

'C’OYLE shrugged. “I don’t 
know. Maybe they were 
dumped on Mars or Venus. Most 
probably they were sold to a la- 
bor camp on the Moon, which is 
why they haven’t been able to 
get in touch with you. I don’t

can tell IB." 

“Are you lying, tricking me?” 

“Is that locket a lie? I’m telling 
the truth— all the truth I know. 
I want to find out why they left 
me to die and who gave the or- 
der. The man who gave the order 
will know where your mother and 
sisters are. He’ll tell you . be- 
fore I kill him. He’ll have plenty 
of time. He’ll be a long time 
dying.” 

Robin looked at him in horror. 
The passion that gripped him was 
making his face once again show 
the scarlet stigmata. He looked 
like a tiger closing in for the kill. 

“I’ve got a fortune to spend. 
Never mind how I got it. I’ve got 
three months to finish the job. 
I’ve learned enough math to 
compute the probabilities. Three 
months is the outside before they 
figure that Fourmyle of Ceres is 
Gully Foyle. Ninety days. From 
Hew Year’s to All Fools. Will you 
join me?” 

“You?” Robin cried with loath- 
ing. “Join you?” 



“All this Four li^le Ciiiiisii is 
camouflage. Nobody ever su^ 
pects a clown. But I’ve been 
studying, learning, preparing for 
the finish. All I need now is you.” 
“Why?” 

“I don’t know where the hunt 
is going to lead me— society or 
slums. I’ve got to be prepared for 
both. The slums I can handle 
alone; I haven’t forgotten the gut- 
ter. But I need you for society. 
Will you come in with me?” 
“You’re hurting me.” Robin 
wrenched her arm out of Foyle’s 
grasp. 

“Sorry. I lose control when I 
think a^ut Vorga. Will you help 
me find Vorga and your family?” 
“I hate you,” Robin burst out. 
“I despise you. You’re rotten. You 
destroy evers^ihing you touch. 
Someday I’ll pay you back.” 

“But we work together from 
New Year’s to All Fools?” 

“We work together,” she said 
venomously.
