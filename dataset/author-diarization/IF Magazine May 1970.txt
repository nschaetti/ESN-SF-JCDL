“We want to test your writing aptitude” 



If you have ever wanted 
to write, here is your 
opportunity to find out if you 
have talent worth developing. 
Take this revealing 
Aptitude Test created 
by 1 5 famous authors 

By Rod Serling 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
I would like to test your writing aptitude. 
We’ll help you find out if you have the 
talent it takes to become a successful 
writer. 

Several years ago, I joined together 
with Max Shulman, Faith Baldwin, Ben- 
nett Cerf, Bruce Catton, J. D. Ratcliff 
and several others to form the Famous 
Writers School. Our aim was to help 
qualified people acquire the skills they 
need to break into print. We poured 
everything we know about writing into a 
new kind of professional training course, 
which you take at home in your free time. 
After a solid grounding in the fundamen- 
tals of all good writing, you get advanced 
training in the specialty of your choice. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers or editors. 
Your instructor goes over your work 
word by word, blue-penciling corrections 
right on it— much as an editor does with 
established writers. Then he returns it to 
you with a long, personal letter of advice. 
This training works well. Our students

winner, made TV writing an art form with

short stories and motion picture scripts.

To find out if you can benefit from this 
training, send for the School’s free Apti-

evidence of writing ability you may en- 
roll. But there is no obligation.

CONFESSION: I seem to have 
walked through a door without both- 
ering to see if it was open. But I got 
through and met the most delightful 
man on the other side. 

Here he is. 

Dear Ejler: 

Permit me to point out an error in 
your letter column in IF § 146 (Mar. 
1970), p. 155, where you say ‘'the Cau- 
casoids are vastly outnumbered." The 
current anthropological figures for the 
earth's population break down thus: 
Caucasoids 60%, Mongoloids 30%, 
Negroids 10%. The other races (Bush- 
men, Australoids, Polynesians, &c.) 
not classifiable under any of those 3 
heads total less than 1%. The Cauca- 
soids, however, consist of about half 
"light" Caucasoids , e.g. Europeans, 
North Africans, & their descendants, 
and half "dark" Caucasoids from 
southern Asia, i.e. India and the adja- 
cent lands. Some of these are pretty 
black, but in all traits other than pig- 
mentation (hair, facial contours, blood 
groups, &c.) they are just as Cauca- 
soid as thou and 1. 

Kqor, 

L. Sprague de Camp 

I cannot speak for thee but Fm at 
least as much Finn as Swedish and 



Finns (and Magyars) in most ethnolog- 
ical tables Fve seen are listed as Asi- 
ans. Caucasoids, however, are defined 
as ‘‘resembling or allied to" Caucasi- 
ans and I both resemble and am al- 
lied to. 

We're in an interesting area here. 
You can get into some heatedly eru- 
dite arguments in Finland about the 
Finno-Asian bit and at least one elev- 
enth or twelfth-century European 
scholar (not Finnish) wrote extensively 
and proved at least to his own satis- 
faction that the Finns were one of the 
lost tribes of Israel. Columbia Univer- 
sity Library stacks devote a shelf as 
long as a lifetime to the Finno-Hun- 
garian language and migrations, which 
seemed to me an awful lot of bother. 

How much of established ethnology 
is a matter of semantics, arbitrary 
classification and occasional wishful 
thinking? The question — and answer — 
are honest: I really don’t know. One 
tabulation I recently saw lists Latins 
as extinct but admits the existence of 
some “Latin-like" peoples. Blond but 
otherwise Negroid hair has shown per- 
sistence in Norway. Caused specula- 
tion that, as I remember, tried but nev- 
er really got off the ground. 

Thanks for the correction. I was 
sloppy. 

Ejler Jakobsson, meet Ejler Jakobs- 
son: 

In the November, 1969, Galaxy, Ej- 
ler Jakobsson, editor, writes, (p. 143): 
"Any . adman knows that he can 
make a rose smell like a stink weed by 
giving it a new name. Let's stop pol- 



2 




luting our brains . " 

In the same issue, p. 135, the blurb- 
writer ( if not Jakobsson, Jakobsson is 
nonetheless accountable) writes: 
“Frank (Herbert] is Higher Education 
editor for the Seattle Post-Intelligence. 
Or did he say Riot Editor?” 

Sure. Higher education . students 
. political action (demonstrations <& 
such) . rioh { which chain of implica- 
tions says something about the value 
judgments of the man who wrote that 
blurb. ) 

Pollution. Right on. Someone needs 
an emission-control device. 

peace, brother 
J.M. Graetz 
Cambridge, Mass. 

The passage you quote is from Gal- 
axy Stars, not from a blurb, and the 
words are Frank Herbert’s in a phone 
interview. What I wrote on the editor’s 
page was complete on that page. I 
don’t know from where you pulled in 
your series of implications. 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

I have met many people in Calgary 
who read science fiction. Several of the 
350,000 persons resident here have ex- 
pressed interest in a science fiction 
group, provided that such an organi- 
zation already existed. To date such a 
group has not been formed. 

One reader pointed out, “Why have 
a science fiction society?” Indeed that 
is the problem. I would like to have a 
solution to it. When readers bump into 
each other at the bookstore they often 
have a very pleasant discussion of au- 



thors, books, favorite magazines, etc. 
It might be nice to hold these conver- 
sations at more regular intervals in 
better surroundings. 

It is possible for a large crowd to at- 
tend the first meeting. But what hap- 
pens then? What do science fiction 
groups DO that would justify meeting 
once a month? What advantages would 
be gained by being a member? Is it re- 
ally worthwhile to have a group like 
this? 

I would like to know since there 
must be some reasonable excuse to 
form a group in Calgary. 

If you have any suggestions con- 
cerning the creation and maintenance 
of this type of society I would be 
pleased to hear from you. I would ap- 
preciate it if you could also forward 
my request to anyone you believe 
could be of help. 

Please accept my thanks in advance 
for any ideas you have on the situa- 
tion. 

Sincerely, 
Brian Hval 
Alberta, Canada 

Dear Mr. Jakobsson: 

Many thanks for the improvements 
in Galaxy and If, including the print- 
ing method and. the artwork. The qual- 
ity of the stories has stayed the same, 
with the best recent one being “Half 
Past Human.” 

The distribution of your magazines 
has greatly improved since the change 
of ownership. Originally, they arrived 
here from six to nine weeks late — they

TRIP 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 



Only one girl on Earth 
could bring out the 
beast in these two men! 




I 

I AM a redemption project for 
her. She lives on my floor of the 
hotel, a dozen rooms down the hall: 
a lady poet, private income. No, 
that makes her sound too old, a 
middle-aged eccentric. Actually she 
is no more than thirty. Taller than I 
am, with long kinky brown hair and 
a sharp, bony nose that has a bump 
on the bridge. Eyes are very glossy. 
A studied raggedness about her 
dress — carefully chosen shabby 
clothes. I am in no position really 
to judge the sexual attractiveness 
of Earthfolk but I gather from re- 
marks made by men living here 
that she is not considered good- 
looking. I pass her often on my way 
to my room. She smiles fiercely at 
me. Saying to herself, no doubt. 
You poor lonely man. Let me help 
you bear the burden of your un- 
happy life. Let me show you the 
meaning of love, for I, too, know 
what it is like to be alone. 

Or words to that ettect. She’s 
never actually said any such thing. 
But her intentions are transparent. 
When she sees me a kind of hunger 
comes into her eyes, part maternal, 
part (I guess) sexual, and her face 
takes on a wild crazy intensity. 
Her name is Elizabeth Cooke. 
“Are you fond of poetry, Mr. 
Knecht?” she asked me this morn- 
ing as we creaked upward together 
in the ancient elevator. 

An hour later she knocked at my 
door. “Something for you to read,’’ 

6 



she said. “I wrote them.’’ A sheaf 
of large yellow sheets stapled at the 
top — poems printed in smeary blue 
mimeography. The Reality Trip, 
the collection was headed. Limited 
Edition: 125 Copies. “You can 
keep it if you like,’’ she explained. 
“I’ve got lots more.’’ 

She was wearing bright corduroy 
slacks and a flimsy pink shawl 
through which her breasts plainly 
showed. Small tapering breasts, not 
very functional-looking. When she 
saw me studying them her nostrils 
flared momentarily and she blinked 
her eyes three times swiftly. Tokens 
of lust? 

I read the poems. Is it fair for 
me to offer judgment on them? 
Even though I’ve lived on this plan- 
et eleven of its years, even though 
my command of colloquial English 
is quite good, do I really compre- 
hend the inner life of poetry? I 
thought they were all rather bad. 
Earnest, plodding poems, captur- 
ing what they call slices of life. 
The world around her, the cruel, 
brutal, unloving city. Lamenting 
the barriers between people. The 
title poem began: 

He was on the reality trip. Big 
black man, bloodshot eyes, 
bad teeth. Eisenhower jacket, 
frayed. Smell of cheap wine. I 
guess a knife in his pocket. 
Looked at me mean. Criminal 
record. Rape, child-beating, 
possession of drugs. In his 
head saying, slavemistress 



IF 




bitch, and me in my head 
saying, black brother, let's 
freak in together, let's trip 
on love — 

And so forth. Warm, direct emo- 
tion — but is the urge to love all 
wounded things a sufficient center 
for poetry? I don’t know. I did put 
her poems through the scanner and 
transmit them to Homeworld, al- 
though I doubt they’ll learn much 
from them about Earth. It would 
flatter Elizabeth to know that 
while she has few readers here, she 
has acquired some ninety light- 
years away. But of course I can’t 
tell her that. 

She came back a short while ago. 

“Did you like them?’’ she asked. 

“Very much. You have sympa- 
thy for those who suffer.’’ 

I think she expected me to invite 
her in. I was careful not to look at 
her breasts this time. 

T he hotel is on West 23rd 
Street. It must be over a hun- 
dred years old — the facade is prac- 
tically baroque and the interior 
shows a kind of genteel decay. The 
place has a bohemian tradition. 
Most of its guests are permanent 
residents and many of them are art- 
ists, novelists, playwrights and 
such. I have lived here nine years. I 
know a number of the residents by 
name and they me — but I have dis- 
couraged any real intimacy, natur- 
ally, everyone has respected that 
choice. I do not invite others in- 

THE REALITYTRIP 



to my room. Sometimes I let my- 
self be invited to visit theirs, since 
one of my responsibilities on this 
world is to get to know something 
of the way Earthfolk live and think. 
Elizabeth is the first to attempt to 
cross the invisible barrier of privacy 
I surround myself with. I’m not 
sure how I’ll handle that. She 
moved in about three years ago. 
Her attentions became noticeable 
perhaps ten months back and for 
the last five or six weeks she’s been 
a great nuisance. Some kind of 
confrontation is inevitable: either 
I must tell her to leave me alone, or 
I will find myself drawn into a situ- 
ation impossible to tolerate. Per- 
haps she’ll find someone else to 
feel 'even sorrier for, before it 
comes to that. 

My daily routine rarely varies. I 
rise at seven. First Feeding. Then I 
clean my skin (my outer one, the 
Earthskin, I mean) and dress. 
From eight to ten I transmit data 
to Homeworld. Then I go out for 
the morning field trip: talking to 
people, buying newspapers, often 
some library research. At one I re- 
turn to my room. Second Feeding. 
I transmit data from two to five. 
Out again, perhaps to the theater, 
to a motion picture, to a political 
meeting. I must soak up the flavor 
of this planet. Often to saloons — I 
am equipped for ingesting alcohol, 
though of course I must get rid of 
it before it has been in my body 
very long — and I drink and listen 
and sometimes argue. At midnight 

7 




back to my room. Third Feeding. 
Transmit data from one to four in 
the morning. Then three hours of 
sleep and at seven the cycle begins 
anew. It is a comforting schedule. 
I don’t know how many agents 
Homeworld has on Earth but 1 
like to think that I’m one of the 
most diligent and useful. I miss 
very little. I’ve done good service 
and, as they say here, hard work is 
its own reward. I won’t deny that I 
hate the physical discomfort of it 
and frequently give way to real de- 
spair over my isolation from my 
own kind. Sometimes I even think 
of asking for a transfer to Home- 
world. But what would become of 
me there? What services could I 
perform? I have shaped my life to 
one end: that of dwelling among 
the Earthfolk and reporting on 
their ways. If I give that up, I am 
nothing. 

O F COURSE there is the phys- 
ical pain. Which is consider- 
able. 

The gravitational pull of Earth 
is almost twice that of Home- 
world. It makes for a leaden life 
for me. My inner organs always 
sagging against the lower rijn of 
my carapace. My muscles crack- 
ing with strain. Every movement a 
willed effort. My heart in constant 
protest. In my eleven years I have, 
as one might expect, adapted 
somewhat to the conditions — I 
have toughened, I have thickened. 
I suspect that if I were transported 

8 



instantly to Homeworld now I 
would be quite giddy, baffled by 
the lightness of everything. I would 
leap and soar and stumble and 
might even miss this crushing pull 
of Earth. Yet I doubt that. I suf- 
fer here; at all times the weight 
oppresses me. Not to sound too 
self-pitying about it. I knew the 
conditions in advance. I was placed 
in simulated Earth gravity when I 
volunteered and was given a 
chance to withdraw and I decided 
to go anyway. Not realizing that a 
week under double gravity is not 
the same thing as a lifetime. I 
could always hav.e stepped out of 
the simulation chamber. Not here. 
The eternal drag on every mole- 
cule of me. The pressure. My flesh 
is always in mourning. 

And the outer body I must wear. 
This cunning disguise. Forever to 
be swaddled in thick masses of syn- 
thetic flesh, smothering me, en- 
gulfing me. The soft slippery slap 
of it against the self within. The 
elaborate framework that holds it 
erect, by which I make it move — a 
forest of struts and braces and ser- 
voactuators and cables, in the 
midst of which I must unendingly 
huddle, atop my little platform in 
the gut. Adopting one or another 
of various uncomfortable posi- 
tions, constantly shifting and 
squirming, now jabbing myself on 
some awkardly placed projection, 
now trying to make my inflexible 
body flexibly to bend. Seeing the 
world by periscope through me- 

IF

chanical eyes. Enwombed in this 
mountain of meat. It is a clever 
thing— it must look convincingly 
human, since no one has ever 
doubted me and it ages ever so 
slightly from year to year, graying 
a bit at the temples, thickening a 
bit at the paunch. It walks. It talks. 
It takes in food and drink when it 
has to. (And deposits them in a re- 
movable pouch near my leftmost 
arm.) And 1 within it. The hidden 
chessplayer. The invisible rider. If 
I dared I would periodically strip 
myself of this cloak of flesh and 
crawl around my room in my own 
guise. But it is forbidden. Eleven 
years now and I have not been out- 
side my protoplasmic housing. I 
feel sometimes that it has come to 
adhere to me, that it is by now a 
part of me. 

In order to eat I must unseal it 
at the middle, a process that takes 
many minutes. Three times a day 
I unbutton myself so that I can 
stuff the food concentrates in- 
to my true gullet. Faulty design, I 
call that. They could just as easily 
have arranged it so I could pop the 
food into my Earthmouth and 
have it land in my own digestive 
tract. I suppose the newer models 
have that. Excretion is just as 
troublesome for me — I unseal, 
reach in, remove the cubes of 
waste, seal my skin again. Down 
the toilet with them. A nuisance. 

And the loneliness! To look at 
the stars and know Homeworld is 
out there somewhere! To think of 



all the others, mating, chanting, di- 
viding, abstracting, while I live out 
my days in this crumbling hotel on 
an alien planet, tugged down by 
gravity and locked within a 
cramped counterfeit body — always 
alone, always pretending that I am 
not what I am and that I am what 
I am not, spying, questioning, re- 
cording, reporting, coping with the 
misery of solitude, hunting for the 
comforts of philosopTiy. 

In all of this there is only one 
real consolation, aside, that is, 
from the pleasure of knowing that 
I am of service to Homeworld. 
The atmosphere of New York 
City grows grimier every year. The 
streets are full of crude vehicles 
belching undigested hydrocarbons. 
To the Earthfolk this stuff is pol- 
lution and they mutter worriedly 
about it. To me it is joy. It is the 
only touch of Homeworld here, 
that sweet soup of organic com- 
pounds adrift in the air. It intoxi- 
cates me. I walk down the street 
breathing deeply, sucking the good 
molecules through my false nos- 
trils to my authentic lungs. The 
natives must think I’m insane. 
Tripping on auto exhaust! Can I 
get arrested for overenthusiastic 
public breathing? Will they pull me 
in for a mental checkup? 




10 



IF 




Elizabeth Cooke continues to 
waft wistful attentions at me. 
Smiles in the hallway. Hopeful 
gleam of the eyes. 

“Perhaps we can have dinner to- 
gether some night soon, Mr. 
Knecht. 1 know we’d have so much 
to talk about. And maybe you’d 
like to see the new poems I’ve been 
doing.’’ 

She is trembling. Eyelids flick- 
ering tensely; head held rigid on 
long neck. I know she sometimes 
has men in her room, so it can’t be 
out of loneliness or frustration 
that she’s cultivating me. And I 
doubt that she’s sexually attracted 
to my outer self. I believe I’m be- 
ing accurate when I say that wom- 
en don’t consider me sexually 
magnetic. No, she loves me be- 
cause she pities me. The sad, shy 
bachelor at the end of the hall, 
dear unhappy Mr. Knecht — can I 
bring some brightness into his 
dreary life? And so forth. I think 
that’s how it is. Will I be able to 
go on avoiding her? Perhaps I 
should move to another part of 
the city. But I’ve lived here for so 
long; I’ve grown accustomed to 
this hotel. Its easy ways do much 
to compensate for the hardships 
of my post. And my familiar 
room. The huge many-paned win- 
dow; the cracked green floor tiles 
in the bathroom; the lumpy pat- 
terns of replastering on the wall 
above my bed. The high ceiling, 
the funny chandelier. Things that 
I love. But of course I can’t let her 



try to start an affair with me. We 
are supposed to observe Earthfolk, 
not to get involved with them. Our 
disguise is not that difficult to pen- 
etrate at close range. I must keep 
her away somehow. Or flee. 

II 

NCREDIBLE! There is another 
of us in this very hotel. 

As I learned through accident. 
At one this afternoon, returning 
from my morning travels: Eliza- 
beth in the lobby, as though lying 
in wait for me, chatting with the 
manager. Rides up with me in the 
elevator. Her eyes looking into 
mine. 

“Sometimes I think you’re 
afraid of me,’’ she begins. “You 
mustn’t be. That’s the great trag- 
edy of human life — people shut 
themselves up behind walls of fear 
and never let anyone through, any- 
one who might care about.them 
and be warm to them. You’ve got 
no reason to be afraid of me.’’ 

I do but how to explain that to 
her? To sidestep prolonged conver- 
sation and possible entanglement I 
get off the elevator one floor be- 
low the right one. Let her think 
I’m visiting a friend. Or a mistress. 
I walk slowly down the hall to the 
stairs, using up time, waiting 
so she will be in her room before 
I go up. A maid bustles by me. 
She thrusts her key into a door on 
the left: a rare faux pas for the 
usually competent help here, she 

11 



THE REALITYTRIP 




forgets to knock before going in 
to make up the room. The door 
opens and the occupant, inside, 
stands revealed. A stocky, muscu- 
lar man, naked to the waist. 

“Oh, excuse me,” the maid 
gasps and backs out, shutting the 
door. 

But I have seen. My eyes are 
quick. The hairy chest is split, a 
dark gash three inches wide and 
some eleven inches long, beginning 
between the nipples and going past 
the navel. Visible within is the 
black shiny surface of a Home- 
wprld carapace. My countryman, 
opening up for Second Feeding. 
Dazed, numbed, I stagger to the 
stairs and pull myself step by lead- 
en step to my floor. No sign of 
Elizabeth. I stumble into my room 
and throw the bolt. Another of us 
here? Well, why not? I’m not the 
only one. There may be hundreds 
in New York alone. But in the 
same hotel? I remember now. I’ve 
seen him occasionally — a silent, 
dour man, tense, hunted-looking, 
unsociable. No doubt I appear the 
same way to others. Keep the 
world at a distance. I don’t know 
his name or what he is supposed to 
do for a living. 

We are forbidden to make con- 
tact with fellow Homeworlders 
except in case of extreme emer- 
gency. Isolation is a necessary 
condition of our employment. I 
may not introduce myself to him 
— I may not seek his friendship. It 
is worse now for me, knowing that 

12 



he is here, than when I was entirely 
alone. The things we could remi- 
nisce about! The friends we might 
have in common! We could rein- 
force one another’s endurance of 
the gravity, the discomfort of our 
disguises, the vile climate. But no. 
I must pretend I know nothing. 
The rules. The harsh, unbending 
rules. I to go about my business, 
he his; if we meet, no hint of my 
knowledge must pass. 

So be it. I will honor my vows. 
But it may be difficult. 



He goes by the name of Swan- 
son. Been living in the hotel eigh- 
teen months — a musician of some 
sort, according to the manager. 

“A very peculiar man. Keeps to 
himself. No small talk, never 
smiles. Defends his privacy. The 
other day a maid barged into his 
room without knocking and I 
thought he’d sue. Well, we get all 
sorts here.” 

The manager thinks my Home- 
worlder may actually be a member 
of one of the old European royal 
families, living in exile. Or some- 
thing similarly romantic. The man- 
ager would be surprised. 




IF 




I defend my privacy too. From 
Elizabeth, another assault on it. 

In the hall outside my room. 

“My new poems,” she said. “In 
case you’re interested.” And then: 
“Can I come in? I’d read them to 
you. I love reading out loud.” 
And: “Please don’t always seem so 
terribly afraid of me. I don’t bite, 
David. Really I don’t. I’m quite 
gentle.” 

“I’m sorry.” 

“So am I.” Anger, now, lurking 
in her shiny eyes, her thin taut lips. 
“If you want me to leave you 
alone — say so, I will. But I want 
you to know how cruel you’re be- 
ing. I don’t demand anything from 
you. I’m just offering some friend- 
ship. And you’re refusing. Do I 
have a bad smell? Am I so ugly? 
Is it my poems you hate and 
you’re afraid to tell me?” 

“Elizabeth—” 

“We’re only on this world such 
a short time. Why can’t we be 
kinder to each other while we are? 
To love, to share, to open up. The 
reality trip. Communication, soul 
to soul.” Her tone changed. An 
artful shading. “For all I know, 
women turn you off. I wouldn’t 
put anybody down for that. We’ve 
all got our ways. But it doesn’t 
have to be a sexual thing, you and 
me. Just talk. Like, opening the 
channels. Please? Say no and I’ll 
never bother you again, but don’t 
say no, please. That’s like shutting 
a door on life, David. And when 
you do that you start to die.” 

THE REALITYTRIP 



Persistent. I should tell her to go 
to hell. But there is the loneliness. 
There is her obvious sincerity. Her 
warmth, her eagerness to pull me 
from my lunar isolation. Can there 
be harm in it? Knowing that Swan- 
son is nearby, so close yet sealed 
from me by iron commandments, 
has intensified my sense of being 
alone. I can risk letting Elizabeth 
get closer to me. It will make her 
happy. It may make me happy. It 
could even yield infotmation valu- 
able to Homeworld. Of course 
I must still maintain certain bar- 
riers. 

“I don’t mean to be unfriendly. 
I think you’ve misunderstood Eliz- 
abeth. I haven’t really been reject- 
ing you. Come in. Do come in.” 

Stunned, she enters my room. 
The first guest ever. My few 
books, my modest furnishings, the 
ultrawave transmitter impenetrably 
disguised as a piece of sculpture. 

She sits. Skirt far above the 
knees. Good legs, if I understand 
the criteria of quality correctly. I 
am determined to allow no sexual 
overtures. If she tries anything I’ll 
resort to — I don’t know — hysteria. 

“Read me your new poems,” I 
say. 

She opens her portfolio. Reads. 

In the midst of the hipster 
night of doubt and Emptiness, 
when the bad-trip god came 
to me with Cold hands, / 
looked up and shouted yes at 
the Stars. And yes and yes

again. I groove on yes; The 
devil grooves on no. And I 
availed for you to Say yes, and 
at last you did. And the world 
said The stars said the trees 
snid the grass said the Sky 
said the streets said yes and 
yes and yes — 

She is ecstatic. Her face is 
flushed. Her eyes are joyous. She 
has broken through to me. After 
two hours, when it becomes obvi- 
ous that 1 am not going to ask her 
to go to bed with me, she leaves. 
Not to wear out her welcome. 

“I’m so glad I was wrong about 
you, David,” she whispers. “I 
couldn’t believe you were really a 
life-denier. And you’re not.” 
Ecstatic. 

I AM getting into very deep wa- 
ter. 

We spend an hour or two to- 
gether every night. Sometimes in 
my room, sometimes in hers. Usu- 
ally she comes to me but now and 
then, to be polite, I seek her out 
after Third Feeding. By now I’ve 
read all her poetry; we talk instead 
of the arts in general, politics, ra- 
cial problems. She has a lively, 
well-stocked, disorderly mind. 
Though she probes constantly for 
information about me, she realizes 
how sensitive I am and quickly 
withdraws when 1 parry her. Ask- 
ing about my work: I reply vague- 
ly that I’m doing research for a 
book and when I don’t amplify she 

14 



drops it, though she tries again, 
gently, a few nights later. 

She drinks a lot of wine and of- 
fers it to me. I nurse one glass 
through the whole visit. Often she 
suggests we go out together for 
dinner. I explain that I have diges- 
tive problems and prefer to eat 
alone. She takes this in good grace 
but immediately resolves to help 
me overcome those problems. 
Soon she is asking me to eat with 
her again. There is an excellent 
Spanish restaurant right in the ho- 
tel, she says. She drops trouble- 
some questions. Where was I 
born? Did I go to college? Do I 
have family somewhere? Have I 
ever been married? Have I publish- 
ed any of my writings? I improvise 
evasions. Nothing difficult about 
that, except that never before have 
I allowed anyone on Earth such 
sustairted contact with me, so pro- 
longed an opportunity to find in- 
consistencies in my pretended iden- 
tity. What if she sees through? 

And sex. Her invitations grow 
less subtle. She seems to think that 
we ought to be having a sexual re- 
lationship simply because we’ve be- 
come such good friends. Not a 
matter of passion as much as one 
of communication — we talk, 
sometimes we take walks together, 
we should do that together too. 
But of course it’s impossible. I 
have the external organs but not 
the capacity to use them. Wouldn’t 
want her touching my false skin in 
any case. How to deflect her? If I 

IF 




declare myself impotent she’ll de- 
mand a chance to try to cure me. 
If I pretend homosexuality she’ll 
start some kind of straighten- 
ing therapy. If I simply say she 
doesn’t turn me on physically she’ll 
be hurt. The sexual thing is a chal- 
lenge to her, as merely getting me 
to talk with her once was. She of- 
ten wears the transparent pink 
shawl that reveals her breasts. Her 
skirts are hip-high. She doses her- 
self with aphrodisiac perfumes. 
She grazes my body with hers 
^^'henever opportunity arises. 

The tension mounts. She is de- 
termined to have me. 

I have said nothing about her in 
my reports to Homeworld. 
Though I do transmit some of the 
psychological data I have gathered 
by observing her. 

“Could you ever admit you 
were in love with me?’’ she asked 
tonight. 

And she asked, “Doesn’t it hurt 
to repress your feelings all the 
time? To sit there locked up inside 
yourself like a prisoner?” 

And: “There’s a physical side of 
life too, David. I don’t mind so 
much the damage you’re doing to 
me by ignoring it. But I worry 
about the damage you’re doing to 
you.” 

Crossing her legs. Hiking her 
skirt even higher. 

We are heading toward a crisis. 
I should never have let this begin. 
A torrid summer has descended on 
the city and in hot weather my ner- 

THE REALITYTRIP 



vous system is always at the edge 
of eruption. She may push me too 
far. I might ruin everything. I 
should apply for transfer to Home- 
world before I cause trouble. May- 
be I should confer with Swanson. I 
think what is happening now quali- 
fies as an emergency. 

Elizabeth stayed past midnight 
tonight. I had to ask her finally to 
leave: work to do. An hour later 
she pushed an envelope under my 
door. 

Newest poems. Love poems. In 
a shaky hand. 

David: You mean so much to 
me. You mean the stars and 
nebulas. Can*t you let me 
show my love? Cant you ac- 
cept happiness? Think about 
it. I adore you. 

What have I started? 



• • • •• 

103®F. today. The fourth succes- 
sive day of intolerable heat. Met 
Swanson in the elevator at lunch- 
time, nearly blurted the truth 
about myself to him. I must be 
more careful. But my control is 
slipping. Last night in the worst of 
the heat I was tempted to strip off 
my disguise. I could no longer 
stand being locked in here, pivot- 
ing and ducking to avoid all the 
machinery festooned about me. 

15 




Resisted the temptation just bare- 
ly. Somehow I am more sensitive 
to the gravity too. I have the illu- 
sion that my carapace is develop- 
ing cracks. Almost collapsed in 
the street this afternoon. All 1 
need: heat exhaustion, whisked off 
to the hospital, routine fluoro- 
scope exam. 

You have a very odd skeletal 
structure, Mr. Knecht. 

Indeed. Dissecting me, next, 
with three thousand medical stu- 
dents looking on. And then the 
United Nations called in. Menace 
from outer space. Yes. I must be 
more careful. 1 must be more 
careful. 1 must be more . 

Ill 

N OW I’ve done it. Eleven years 
of faithful service destroyed in 
a single wild moment. Violation of 
the Fundamental Rule. I hardly 
believe it. How was it possible that 
I— that I — with my respect for my 
responsibilities — that I could have 
— even considered, let alone actu- 
ally done— 

But the weather was terribly 
hot. The third week of the heat 
wave. 1 was stifling inside my false 
body. And the gravity— was New 
York having a gravity wave too? 
That terrible pull, worse than ever. 
Bending my internal organs out of 
shape. Elizabeth a tremendous an- 
noyance, passionate, emotion- 
al, teary, poetic, giving me no 
rest, pleading for me to burn with 



17 



a brighter flame. Declaring her 
love in sonnets, in rambling hip ep- 
ics, in haiku. Spending two hours 
in my room, crouched at my feet, 
murmuring about the hidden beau- 
ty of my soul. 

“Open yourself and let love 
come in,” she whispered. “It’s like 
giving yourself to God. Making a 
commitment, breaking down all 
walls. Why not? For love’s sake, 
David, why not?” 

I couldn’t tell her why not and 
she went away. But about midnight 
she was back knocking at my 
door. I let her in. She wore an 
ankle-length silk housecoat, 
gleaming, threadbare. 

“I’m stoned,” she said hoarsely, 
voice an octave too deep. “I had 
to bust three joints to get up the 
nerve. But here 1 am. David, I’m 
sick of making the turnoff trip. 
We’ve been so wonderfully close 
and then you won’t go the last 
stretch of the way.” A cascade of 
giggles. “Tonight you will. Don’t 
fail me. Darling.” 

Drops the housecoat. Naked 
underneath it. Narrow waist, bony 
hips, long legs, thin thighs, blue 
veins crossing her breasts. Her hair 
wild and kinky. A sorceress. A 
seeress. Berserk. Approaching me, 
eyes slit-wide, mouth open, tongue 
flickering snakily. How fleshless 
she is! Beads of sweat glistening on 
her flat chest. Seizes my wrists, 
tugs me roughly toward the bed. 

We tussle a little. Within my 
false body I throw switches, nudge 

18 



levers. I am stronger than she is. I 
pull free, breaking her hold with an 
effort. She stands flatfooted in 
front of me, glaring, eyes fiery. So 
vulnerable, so sad in her nudity. 

And yet so fierce. 

“David! David! David!” Sob- 
bing. Breathless. Pleading with her 
eyes and the tips of her breasts. 
Gathering her strength — now she 
makes the next lunge but I see it 
coming and let her topple past me. 
She lands on the bed, burying her 
face in the pillow, clawing at the 
sheet. “Why? Why why why 
WHY?” she screams. 

In a minute we will have the 
manager in here. With the police. 

“Am I so hideous? I love you, 
David, do you know what that 
word means? Love. Love.” Sits up. 
Turns to me. Imploring. “Don’t 
reject me,” she whispers.” I 
couWn’t take that. You know, I 
just wanted to make you happy. I 
figured I could be the one, only I 
didn’t realize how unhappy you’d 
make me. And you just stand 
there. And you don’t say anything. 
What are you, some kind of ma- 
chine?” 

“I’ll tell you what I am,” I said. 

That was when 1 went sliding in- 
to the abyss. All control lost, all 
prudence gone. My mind so slath- 
ered with raw emotion that survi- 
val itself means nothing. I must 
make things clear to her, is all. I 
must show her. At whatever ex- 
pense. I strip off my shirt. She 
glows, no doubt thinking I will let 

IF 




myself be seduced. My hands slide 
up and down my bare chest, seek- 
ing the catches and snaps. I go 
through the intricate, cumbersome 
process of opening my body. Deep 
within myself something is shout- 
ing, No No No No No . but I 
pay no attention. The heart has its 
reasons. 

Hoarsely: “Look, Elizabeth. 
Look at me. This is what I am. 
Look at me and freak out. The 
reality trip.” 

My chest opens wide. 

I push myself forward, stepping 
between the levers and struts, 
emerging halfway from the human 
shell I wear. I have not been this 
far out of it since the day they 
sealed me in, on Homeworld, I let 
her see my gleaming carapace. I 
wave my eyestalks around. I allow 
some of my claws to show. 

“See? See? Big black crab from 
outer space. That’s what you love, 
Elizabeth. That’s what I am. David 
Knecht’s just a costume and this 
is what’s inside it.” I have gone in- 
sane. “You want reality? Here’s 
reality, Elizabeth. What good is 
the Knecht body to you? It’s a 
fraud. It’s a machine. Come on, 
come closer. Do you want to kiss 
me? Should I get on you and 
make love?” 

During this episode her face has 
displayed an amazing range of re- 
actions. Open-mouthed disbelief 
at first, of course. And frozen hor- 
ror — gagging sounds in throat, 
jaws agape, eyes wide and rigid. 

THE REALITYTRIP 



Hands fanned across breasts. Sud- 
den modesty in front of the alien 
monster? But then, as the familiar 
Knecht-voice, now bitter and im- 
passioned, continues to flow from 
the black thing within the sundered 
chest, a softening of her response. 
Curiosity. The poetic sensibility 
taking over. Nothing human is 
alien to me: Terence, quoted by 
Cicero. Nothing alien is alien to 
me. Eh? She will accept the evi- 
dence of her eyes. 

“What are you? Where did you 
come from?” 

And I say, “I’ve violated the 
Fundamental Rule. I deserve to be 
plucked and thinned. We Ye not 
supposed to reveal ourselves. If we 
get into some kind of accident that 
might lead to exposure, we’re sup- 
posed to blow ourselves up. The 
switch is right here.” 

She comes close and peers 
around me, into the cavern of 
David Knecht’s chest. 

“From some other planet? Liv- 
ing here in disguise?” She under- 
stands the picture. Her shock is 
fading. She even laughs. “I’ve seen 
worse than you on acid,” she says. 
“You don’t frighten me now, Dav- 
id. David? Shall I go on calling 
you David?” 

This is unreal and dreamlike to 
me. I have revealed myself, think- 
ing to drive her away in terror; she 
is no longer aghast, and smiles at 
my strangeness. She kneels to get 
a better look. I move back a short 
way. Eyestalks fluttering — I am 

19 




uneasy, I have somehow lost the 
upper hand in this encounter. 

She says, “I knew you were un- 
usual, but not like this. But it’s 
all right. I can cope. I mean, the 
essential personality, that’s what I 
fell in love with. Who cares that 
you’re a crab-man from the Green 
Galaxy? Who cares that we can’t 
ever be real lovers? I can make 
that sacrifice. It’s your soul I dig, 
David. Go on. Close yourself up 
again. You don’t look comfort- 
able this way.” The triumph of 
love. She will not abandon me, 
even now. Disaster. I crawl back 
into Knecht and lift his arms to 
his chest to seal it. Shock is glaz- 
ing my consciousness: the enor- 
mity, the audacity. What have I 
done? Elizabeth watches, awed, 
even delighted. At last I am to- 
gether again. She nods. “Listen,” 
she tells me, “you can trust me. 1 
mean, if you’re some kind of spy, 
checking out the Earth, I don’t 
care. I dont care. I won’t tell any- 
body. Pour it all out, David. Tell 
me about yourself. Don’t you see? 
This is the biggest thing that ever 
happened to me. A chance to show 
that love isn’t just physical, isn’t 
just chemistry, that it’s a soul trip, 
that it crosses not just racial lines 
but the lines of the whole damned 
species, the planet itself — ” 




It took several hours to get rid 
of her. A soaring, intense conver- 
sation, Elizabeth doing most of the 
talking. She putting forth theories 
of why I had come to Earth, I 
nodding, denying, amplifying, 
mostly lost in horror at my own 
perfidy and barely listening to her 
monolog. And the humidity turn- 
ing me into rotting rags. 

Finally: “I’m down from the 
pot, David. And all wound up. 
I’m going out for a walk. Then 
back to my room to write for a 
while. To put this night into a 
poem before I lose the power of 
it. But I’ll come to you again by 
dawn, all right? That’s maybe five 
hours from now. You’ll be here? 
You won’t do anything foolish? 
Oh, I love you so much, David! 
Do you believe me? Do you?” 

When she was gone I stood a 
long while by the window, trying 
to reassemble myself. Shattered. 
Drained. Remembering her kisses, 
her lips running along the ridge 
marking the place where my chest 
opens. The fascination of the 
abomination. She will love me 
even if I am crustaceous beneath. 

I had to have help. 

I went to Swanson’s room. He 
was slow to respond to my knock 
— busy transmitting, no doubt. I 
could hear him within but he didn’t 
answer. 

“Swanson?” I called. “Swan- 
son?” Then I added the distress 
signal in the Homeworld tongue. 
He rushed to the door. Blinking, 



20 



IF 





21 





suspicious. “It’s all right,’’ I said. 
“Look, let me in. I’m in big trou- 
ble.’’ 

Speaking English. But I gave 
him the distress signal again. 

“How did you know about 
me?’’ he asked. 

“The day the maid blundered 
into your room while you were 
eating, I was going by. I saw.’’ 

“But you aren’t supposed to — ’’ 

“Except in emergencies. This is 
an emergency.’’ 

He shut off his ultrawave and 
listened intently to my story. 
Scowling. He didn’t approve. But 
he wouldn’t spurn me. I had been 
criminally foolish but I was of his 
kind, prey to the same pains, the 
same lonelinesses, and he would 
help me. 

“What do you plan to do now?’’ 
he asked. “You can’t harm her. It 
isn’t allowed.’’ 

“I don’t want to harm her. Just 
to get free of her. To make her 
fall out of love with me.’’ 

“How? If showing yourself to 
her didn’t — ’’ 

“Infidelity,’’ I said. “Making 
her see that I love someone else. 
No room in my life for her. That’ll 
drive her away. Afterward it won’t 
matter that she knows — who’d be- 
lieve her story? The FBI would 
laugh and tell her to lay off the 
LSD. But if I don’t break her at- 
tachment to me I’m finished.’’ 

“Love someone else? Who?’’ 

“When she comes back to my 
room at dawn,’’ I said, “she’ll 

22 



find the two of us together, divid- 
ing and abstracting. I think that’ll 
do it, don’t you?’’ 

S O I deceived Elizabeth with 
Swanson. 

The fact that we both wore 
male human identities was ir- 
relevant, of course. We went to 
my room and stepped out of our 
disguises — a bold, dizzying sensa- 
tion — and suddenly we were just 
two Homeworlders again, recep- 
tive to one another’s needs. I left 
the door unlocked. Swanson and I 
crawled up on my bed arid began 
the chanting. How strange it was 
after these years of solitude to feel 
those vibrations again! And how 
beautiful. Swanson’s vibrissae 
touching mine. The interplay of 
harmonies. An underlying stern- 
ness tahis technique — he was con- 
temptuous of me for my idiocy 
and rightly so — but once we passed 
from the chanting to the dividing 
all was forgiven. And as we moved 
into the abstracting it was truly 
sublime. We climbed through an 
infinity of climactic emptyings. 
Dawn crept upon us and found us 
unwilling to halt even for rest. 

A knock at the door. Elizabeth. 
“Come in,’’ I said. 

A dreamy, ecstatic look on her 
face. Fading instantly when she 
saw the two of us entangled on the 
bed. A questioning frown. 

“We’ve been mating,’’ I ex- 
plained. “Did you think I was a 
complete hermit?’’ She looked 

IF 




from Swanson to me, from me to 
Swanson. Hand over her mouth. 
Eyes anguished. I turned the screw 
a little tighter. “I couldn’t stop 
you from falling in love with me, 
Elizabeth. But I really do prefer 
my own kind. As should have been 
obvious.” 

“To have her here now, though 
— when you knew I was coming 
back—” 

“Not her, exactly. Not him ex- 
actly either, though.” 

“ — so cruel, David! To ruin 
such a beautiful experience’” 
Holding forth sheets of paper with 
shaking hands. “A whole sonnet 
cycle,” she said. “About tonight. 
How beautiful it was and all. And 
now — and now — ” Crumpling the 
pages. Hurling them across the 
room. Turning. Running out, sob- 
bing furiously. Hell hath no fury 
like. “David!” A smothered cry. 
And slamming the door. 



• •# 



She was back in ten minutes. 
Swanson and I hadn’t quite fin- 
ished donning our bodies yet — we 
were both still unsealed. As we 
worked we discussed further steps 
to take. He felt honor demanded 
that I request a transfer back to 
Homeworld, having terminated my 
usefulness here through tonight’s 

THE REALITYTRIP 



indiscreet revelation. I agreed with 
him to some degree but was reluc- 
tant to leave. Despite the bodily 
torment of life on Earth I had 
come to feel I belonged here. 

Then Elizabeth entered, radiant. 

“I mustn’t be so possessive,” 
she announced. “So bourgeois. 
So conventional. I’m willing to 
share my love.” Embracing Swan- 
son. Embracing me. “A menage a 
trois"' she said. “I won’t mind 
that you two are^ having a physical 
relationship. As long as you don’t 
shut me out of your lives com- 
pletely. I mean, David, we could 
never have been physical anyway, 
right, but we can have the other 
aspects of love. And we’ll open 
ourselves to your friend also. Yes? 
Yes? Yes?” 




Swanson and I both put in ap- 
plications for transfer, he to Afri- 
ca, I to Homeworld. It would be 
some time before we received a re- 
ply. Until then we were at her 
mercy. He was blazingly angry 
with me for involving him in this 
but what choice had I had? Nor 
could either of us avoid Elizabeth. 
We were at her mercy. She bathed 
both of US' in shimmering waves of 
tender emotion; wherever we 
turned, there she was, incandescent 

23 




with love. Lighting up the dark- 
ness of our lives. You poor lonely 
creatures. Do you suffer much in 
our gravity? What about the heat? 
And the winters. Is there a custom 
of marriage on your planet? Do 
yon have poetry? 

A happy threesome. We went to 
the theater together. To concerts. 
Even to parties in Greenwich Vil- 
lage. 

“My friends,” Elizabeth said, 
leaving no doubt in anyone’s mind 
that she was living with both of us. 
Faintly scandalous doings; she 
loved to seem daring. Swanson 
was sullenly obliging, putting up 
with her antics but privately ha- 
ranguing me for subjecting him to 
all this. Elizabeth got out another 
mimeographed booklet of poems, 
dedicated to both of us. Triple 
Tripping, she called it. Flagrantly 
erotic. I quoted a few of the 
poems in one of my reports to 
Homeworld, then lost heart and 
hid the booklet in the closet. 

“Have you heard about your 
transfer yet?” I asked Swanson at 
least twice a week. 

He hadn’t. Neither had I. 

Autumn came. Elizabeth, burn- 
ing her candle at both ends. Iodised 
gaunt and feverish. 

“I have never kno^^n such hap- 
piness,” she announced frequently, 
one hand clasping Swanson, the 
other me. “I never think about the 
strangeness of you any more. I 
think of you only as people. 
Sweet, wonderful, lonely people. 



Here in the darkness of this horrid 
city.” 

And she once said, “What if 
everybody here is like you and I’m 
the only one who’s really human? 
But that’s silly. You must be the 
only ones of your kind here. The 
advance scouts. Will your planet 
invade ours? I do hope so! Set 
everything to rights. The reign of 
love and reason at last!” 

“How long will this go on?” 
Swanson muttered. 




At the end of October his trans- 
fer came through. He left without 
saying goodbye to either of us and 
without leaving a forwarding ad- 
dress. Nairobi? Addis Ababa? Kin- 
shasa? 

I HAD grown accustomed to 
having him around to share the 
burden of Elizabeth. Now the full 
brunt of her affection fell on me: 
My work was suffering. I had no 
time to file my reports properly. 
And I lived in fear of her gossip- 
ing. What was she telling her Vil- 
lage friends? {You know David? 
He's not really a man, you know. 
Actually inside him there's a kind 
of crab-thing from another solar 
system. But what does that mat-

ter? Love's a universal phenome- 
non. The truly loving person 
doesn't draw limits around the 
planet.) I longed for my release. 
To go home, to accept my punish- 
ment, to shed my false skin. To 
empty my mind of Elizabeth. 

My reply came through the ul- 
trawave on November thirteenth. 
Application denied. I was to re- 
main on Earth and continue my 
work as before. Transfers to 
Homeworld were granted only for 
reasons of health. 

I debated sending a full account 
of my treason to Homeworld and 
thus bringing about my certain 
recall. But I hesitated, over- 
whelmed with despair. Dark 
brooding seized me. 

“Why so sad?” Elizabeth asked. 
What could I say? That my at- 
tempt at escaping from her had 
failed. “I love you,” she said. “I’ve 
never felt so real before.” Nuz- 
zling against my cheek. Fingers 
knotted in my hair. A seductive 
whisper. “David, open yourself up 
again. Your chest, I mean. I want 
to see the inner you. To make sure 
I’m not frightened of it. Please? 
You’ve only let me see you once.” 
And then, when I had: “May I kiss 
you, David?” 

I was appalled. But I let her. 
She was unafraid. Transfigured by 
happiness. She is a cosmic nui- 
sance but I fear I’m getting to like 
her. 

Can I leave her? I wish Swanson 
had not vanished. I need advice.

Either I break with Elizabeth or 
I break with Homeworld. This is 
absurd. I find new chasms of de- 
spondency every day. I am unable 
to do my work. I have requested a 
transfer once again, without giving 
details. The first snow of the win- 
ter today. 




Application denied.

“When I found you with Swan- 
son,” she said, “it was a terrible 
shock. An even bigger blow than 
when you ftrst came out of your 
chest. I mean, it was startling to 
find out you weren’t human but it 
didn’t hit me in any emotional way 
— it didn’t threaten me. But then 
to come back a few hours later 
and find you with one of your own 
kind, to know that you wanted to 
shut me out, that I had no place 
in your life — only we worked it 
out, didn’t we?” 



Kissing me. Tears of joy in her 
eyes. How did this happen? Where 
did it all begin? Existence was once 
so simple. I have tried to trace the 
chain of events that brought me 
from there to here and I cannot. I 
was outside of my false body for 
eight hours today. The longest 
spell so far. Elizabeth is talking 
of going to the islands with me for 
the winter. A secluded cottage that 
her friends will make available. Of 
course, I must not leave my post 
without permission. And it takes 
months simply to get a reply. 




Let me admit the truth: I love 
her. 




January 1. The new year begins. 
I have sent my resignation to 
Homeworld and have destroyed 
my ultrawave equipment. The 
links are broken. Tomorrow, when 
the city offices are open, Elizabeth 
and I will go to get the marriage

TROUBLESHOOTER 



MICHAEL G. CONEY 

His flight companion was 
a brain with a built-in 
nightmare realer than dreams! 



27 



The ship floated huge in space, a 
black leviathan against the stars, 
infinitely menacing. He watched 
the rear viewscreen fear-fascinated 
as he thrust at the controls, push- 
ing hard, although the lever was at 
its extremity. Fingers of terror ca- 
ressed the back of his neck — will- 
ing the little scout to go faster, ac- 
celerate, get away from the mon- 
ster at his back. But the accelera- 
tion Avas imperceptible, as though 
his craft were unable to break 
away from the gravitational pull of 
the giant freighter. As he stared at 
the screen it seemed in his imagi- 
nation that the freighter was grow- 
ing in size rather than diminishing. 
He pumped the levers, striving for 
more thrust. The vibration of the 
rockets altered. The little ship 
shuddered momentarily, hesitated. 
The starboard motor cut out and, 
as he watched, the vast bulk slid 
gradually off the rear screen. Fe- 
verishly he worked the attitude 
controls, striving uselessly to cor- 
rect the wide arc. And presently 
the freighter slid into the forward 
screen like a killer whale moving 
in. He didn't scream. His lips 
moved soundlessly as the freighter 
grew and slowly, in a vivid carmine 
flare, exploded — disintegrating in 
a great cloud of expanding debris 
and white flame. 

Then he screamed hoarsely — 
again and again — as the scout 
plunged into the crimson fireball. 

DeGrazza, still screaming, 
screamed himself into conscious- 
ly 



ness and bright light as the sun 
streamed through the window of 
his bedroom, crimson through his 
eyelids. 

Altairids have. lost their 
A second ship in a week. Lost 
without trace somewhere within 
their asteroid belt. They’ve got to 
blame someone, so they blame 
Galactic Computers. Sometimes I 
wonder whether we ought to stick 
to earthbound computers ^ . 
You’re not looking fresh this 
morning, DeGrazza. Rough 
night?” 

“I’ve known better.” 

“I can let Robins handle it if 
you like — but I wouldn’t have 
brought you back from leave if it 
weren’t important.” Cobb eyed 
DeGrazza critically, noting the in- 
flamed eyelids and the dark sha- 
dows beneath. 

I hope he isn't cracking up. 
Sometimes Cobb found it diffi- 
cult to maintain his self-inflicted 
reputation as the tough-guy boss 
of Galactic Computers — especial- 
ly when he saw good men, like 
DeGrazza exhibiting signs of 
nerves and tension from overwork. 

“It’s all right.” DeGrazza made 
a conscious effort to pull himself 
together. “The Vegan freighter 
business shook me up a bit, I 
guess. And it wasn’t our computer 
that failed to regulate the pile,” he 
added bitterly. “Those bloody 
Vegans had bypassed the control 
to get more power. I see it now!” 

IF 




“I read your report,” Cobb said 
in sympathetic tones, hating him- 
self for a hypocritical bastard. But 
he had to have DeGrazza back on 
this job. “You got a rough deal.” 

A rough deal. Nobody, thought 
DeGrazza, knew the full details of 
that final ten minutes aboard the 
freighter in orbit around Earth, 
when the Vegans had abandoned 
ship leaving him alone to deal with 
the runaway pile. As the captain 
left hastily he had informed De- 
Grazza that if the ship were lost. 
Galactic Computers would be 
made to foot the bill. Then, alone 
in the deserted freighter, he had 
found the overheated linkage fitted 
by the Vegans themselves, warped 
and impossible to shift. He had 
left the ship with minutes to spare 
and the explosion had been seen by 
half the Earth. The outcome was 
still DeGrazza’s word against the 
Vegans. 

“So what’s the job this time?” 
he asked resignedly, wondering 
why he didn’t quit. The answer was 
obvious. Mary made sure they 
lived to the limits of their means; 
the kids’ education cost a fortune 
— the job paid well. 

“Quite simple. You take a trip 
in an Altairid hopper as co-pilot. 
Keep your eyes open. See if any- 
thing suggests itself to you. It’s 
quite a short journey from Altair 
Six to Eight, through the asteroid 
belt. Watch out for those asteroids 
— they’re mostly uncharted.” 

“Our computer ought to handle 

TROUBLESHOOTER 



that easily. It’s radar-coupled.” 

“The Altairids have put in a 
modification,” Cobb informed him 
mildly, bracing himself for the ex- 
plosion. 

It came. When DeGrazza had 
exhausted his extensive vocabulary 
he asked what modification? 

“They’re nervous folk, the Al- 
tairids. They’ve duplicated the con- 
trol system, using an Altairid 
brain.” 

“You mean an organic brain?” 
asked DeGrazza in some disgust. 

This type of organic-mechani- 
cal link-up was prevalent among 
various alien species. They con- 
sidered it progress toward the day 
when an intelligent being would 
employ thought alone to control 
his environment. 

“Uh— yes. It’s fitted in parallel 
with our computer. Receives the 
same instructions from the key- 
board, radar and so on, on dupli- 
cated wiring — but does nothing un- 
less positive instruction is received, 
either from pilot or radar, that the 
computor is making a mistake. 
Then it can override our equip- 
ment.” 

“So the brain is superfluous,” 
commented DeGrazza. 

“I should have thought so but 
the Altairids think otherwise. They 
say that if our computer should 
break down in an emergency, say 
due to an overload in the input, 
the brain is quick. It can receive 
input without a keyboard.” 

“How’s that?” 

29 




“Oh, didn’t you know?” Cobb’s 
tone was innocent. “The Altairids 
are telepathic.” 

He eyed DeGrazza blandly. 
“That’s all I need,” muttered 
DeGrazza in disgust. “To have 
one of those weirdies picking my 
mind while I’m trying to stop an 
argument between our computer 
and their blasted brain:” 

Cobb remarked, “So you’ve 
come to the same conclusion. 
Somewhere there’s a conflict be- 
tween the computer and the brain. 
Maybe over a certain type of in- 
struction.” 

“If I notice any trouble brewing 
up between them,” grated DeGraz- 
za savagely, “I’ll put a bullet 
though that brain.” 

But you cant do that, DeGraz- 
za, because preservation of equip- 
ment comes before preservation of 
self They say because an examina- 
tion of faulty gear may yield infor- 
mation to save hundreds of lives 
but you know they are lying. The 
machine has replaced the man — 
therefore it is more valuable and 
must be saved first. But the brain 
is organic. What is the order of 
precedence here? 

I T USED to be a long way from 
Earth to Altair but hyperspace 
and FTL changed all that and the 
journey left him with little time 
for dreaming. 

He was met at the pad and es- 
corted to the offices of Altair 
Hoppers. The Altairids were hu- 

30 



manoid— tall, gentle people with 
luminous eyes and they looked at 
him, at his uncouth, squat, 
bearded form as though he were a 
murderer. He wondered what they 
were thinking — what signals 
flashed from mind to mind of the 
reception committee, as they met 
DeGrazza, the embodiment of the 
company whose computers had 
lured their colleagues to death 
among the asteroids. 

DeGrazza, your guilt is show- 
ing. These men can read your 
mind. The computers are fool- 
proof— think that if you can! 

Toward the end of the second 
day of the seven-day hop DeGraz- 
za tried an experiment, first ensur- 
ing that the Altairid pilot was safe- 
ly asleep. He glanced at the for- 
ward viewscreen, saw nothing un- 
toward apart from the occasional 
streak of an outlying pebble from 
the asteroid belt. The cabin of the 
hopper was tiny, the bulk of the 
large ship being taken up with car- 
go space for slow-speed interplan- 
etary trading. The two seats, pi- 
lot’s and copilot’s, were side by 
side, facing a common console. 
Set into the fascia of the console, 
in addition to the controls, were 
the forward and rear viewscreens 
and behind it, between the instru- 
ments and the nose of the ship, 
were the radar, the Galactic’s 
computer and, presumably, the 
brain. 



IF 




DeGrazza reached forward and 
punched a random series of direc- 
tions into the computer keyboard, 
watching the gyroscopic DF nee- 
dles carefully. 

The ship appeared to hesitate, 
lurched slightly — then the needles 
steadied as the brain, sensing 
through the radar no obstacles 
ahead, corrected the erroneous da- 
ta and brought the ship back on 
course. 

First round to the Altairids. 

DeGrazza sat back and contem- 
plated. From the information sup- 
plied by the Altairids he had gath- 
ered that the brains used were, in 
effect, hypnotized before installa- 
tion and programed to respond 
only when their subconscious reg- 
istered an unexpected deviation. 
Thus they would normally be alert 
only when the ships were among 
the larger asteroids and course 
corrections were frequent. Other- 
wise their higher thinking capabili- 
ties were shut down. A brain could 
not therefore ponder to itself for 
years in a lonely, inactive void and 
thereby go insane. Theoretically. 
The brain, he told himself, was an 
organic computer, nothing more. 
Moreover, it could only think in 
terms of figures, so they said. 

So why had two ships crashed 
among the asteroids? 

Was the ship's brain thinking a 
few moments ago? Did the brain 
know horror and bewilderment as 
the ship veered insanely off course, 
a madman at the controls? 

troubleshooter 



Steady, DeGrazza. It's quite 
possible that the brain can read 
your mind and had anticipated the 
test you proposed before your fin- 
gers hit the keys. But that should 
not be possible because the brain 
cannot conceive abstract ideas — 
only digits. How do you express 
fear in numbers? Does the brain 
resent the computer in some math- 
ematical fashion? 

The cabin was very small, 
womblike — the feeling that there 
were more than two intelligencies 
present was claustrophobic. 

How many can think, and how 
do they think? DeGrazza, Altairid, 
brain, computer. Everywhere a 
conflict. 

The ship lurched again, suddenly 
and violently, and this time De- 
Grazza hadn’t touched the con- 
trols. Again came the jolt — he 
stared at the screen but could see 
nothing to account for the devia- 
tion. 

“What’s happening?’’ 

The Altairid was alert, grasping 
the manual attitude controls, peer- 
ing at the gyro needles. Quickly he 
brought the ship back on course. 

“I don’t know,’’ admitted De- 
Grazza. “She suddenly went ber- 
serk. I didn’t touch anything.’’ 

“Then the computer suffered a 
malfunction,” stated the alien with 
underlying satisfaction. “It’s for- 
tunate that this didn’t happen 
among the asteroids proper.” 

31 




DeGrazza went on the defensive. 

“Perhaps the brain went hay- 
wire.” 

“If I had been in your position I 
would have tested the brain during 
my sleep period,” remarked the 
Altairid shrewdly. “I imagine you 
did so.” 

“I did,” DeGrazza muttered re- 
luctantly. Then, with a sudden 
flash of annoyance: “Were you 
reading my thoughts? We’d better 
get this straight. If you want my 
cooperation you’ve got to keep out 
of my mind. I won’t have it, I tell 
you. Don’t forget, you’ve no 
proof that our computers went 
wrong. That’s only supposition and 
it wouldn’t get you anywhere in 
court. But between us we might 
sort something out — if you lay off 
the telepathy.” 

“Steady, DeGrazza,” admon- 
ished the alien gently. “I wasn’t 
prying into your brain. I don’t 
work like that. Unless I make a 
deliberate effort to concentrate, all ’ 
I receive from you is a general im- 
pression of the emotions upper- 
most in your mind.” 

“Let’s keep it that way.” 

“Naturally. Now, if you will 
forgive me, what was the outcome 
of your private test on the brain?” 

“It worked. It regained con- 
trol.” 

“So the computer must be 
faulty.” 

“Listen,” said DeGrazza des- 
perately. “I’ve worked for Galactic 
Computers for twenty years and 



we’ve never in all that time had a 
serious malfunction. The unit it- 
self is foolproof — duplicated print- 
ed circuits, the lot. Any error has 
always been in the ancillary equip- 
ment and that’s pretty safe, too. 
But the computer must work per- 
fectly. It’s the combination of 
computer plus brain that causes 
the trouble. It can’t be anything 
else. Some sort of feedback be- 
tween the two.” 

“The brain cannot fail,” stated 
the alien categorically. 

This time the Vegan freighter 
W 05 under his feet. He way kicking 
himself off across the short dis- 
tance to the scout's airlock. Space 
was like oil — he floated slowly, so 
slowly, manipulating the jet pack 
with fumbling fingers, setting his 
course to cover the distance in the 
quickest time, forgetting in his 
haste the slight rotation of the 
huge ship. He was drifting past his 
scout too fast to make another 
correction — he would have to 
make an orbit and approach the 
airlock from the opposite direc- 
tion. The hull plates crept past — a 
horizontal weld, a blank area of 
metal, a strip of weld, again, again 
— how many plates were there to a 
circumference, for God's sake? At 
last, the airlock. He seized the 
projecting handhold, stepped inside 
the confined space, turned to pull 
the hatch shut behind him. He saw 
the black freighter expand like an 
overinflated tube and burst, sweep- 

IF 



32 




ing fire towards the scout, engulf- 
ing him. 

D E GRAZZA!” The shout 
echoed in his ears as he 
struggled to the surface of life. 

He opened his eyes. The Altairid 
stood before him, staring into his 
face with an expression of horror 
and concern. He gazed around 
him, feeling the sweat dribbling 
down his neck, seeing the interior 
of the cabin. He was in the Altai- 
rid hopper, three days out from 
Altair VI, and the Vegan freighter 
was weeks behind him. 

“What’s the trouble?’’ he asked. 
“Your mind is haunted,’’ replied 
the alien slowly. 

DeGrazza, you are haunted by 
the converging pressures of the 
past and future, squeezing your 
mind until it screams with pain in 
the night when the defences are re- 
laxed. Mary, the Vegan freighter, 
the kids, Mary, the brain, Cobb, 
the Altairid, Mary — all pushing 
your senses to madness, crushing 
upon you from the past. But what 
unknown glacier of fear is pressing 
back from the future, chilling your 
mind with advance icebergs of pre- 
sentiment? 

“What are you talking about? I 
sometimes have nightmares, that’s 
all. If you didn’t pry into other 
people’s minds you wouldn’t get 
frightened. Lay off me, will 
you?’’ 

TROUBLESHOOTER 



DeGrazza sank back in his seat, 
trembling as much from reaction 
to the dream as from annoyance at 
the Altairid’s intrusion. 

“The contact was not of my 
seeking. The emissions were so 
strong that I couldn’t keep them 
out. I’ve never seen a mental pic- 
ture so vivid.’’ 

“Don’t you get dreams?’’ 

A thoughtful silence. 

Then: “Occasionally. Like 

yours — but mine are a race mem- 
ory which affects most of my peo- 
ple. We see a giant explosion in the 
sky, accompanied by a sensation 
of utter horror. Probably the simi- 
larity to your dream is what dis- 
turbed me.’’ 

“A race memory?’’ 

“You do not know Altairid his- 
tory? Once we were a young race 
and warlike, very unlike our pres- 
ent timid selves. We had spread 
from what you call Altair Six to 
the nearest two planets. Seven and 
Eight, but our sciences had not 
taught us sense.’’ 

“Science and sense are not al- 
ways synonymous, in any lan- 
guage,’’ observed DeGrazza rue- 
fully. 

“This was a long time ago and 
we like to think that we have pro- 
gressed since. Anyway, one day 
Altair Seven, the first colony,, pro- 
claimed independence. Imagine 
that — they came from the same 
stock as their fathers on Altair 
Six, yet they wished to be consid- 
ered apart.’’ 



33 




“I’ve known examples which 
have worked out.” 

“But we are telepathic— all of 
the same family. It was like an 
amputation.” 

“Or like putting a live brain in 
a box?” asked DeGrazza skepti- 
cally. 

“That is necessity born of our 
cautious characteristics, which 
were themselves born of the events 
which followed independence of 
Altair Seven. As I was saying — 
the fact that members of our own 
race had cut themselves off was 
felt very deeply. Overtures were 
made but to no effect. They were 
repulsed — and gradually the atti- 
tude of both factions hardened. 
Diplomatic relations were eventu- 
ally severed entirely. All of this oc- 
curred centuries ago, you under- 
stand. Then came the climax. The 
breakaway world of Altair Seven 
laid claim to Altair Eight on the 
grounds that it was from their 
planet that Eight had been colo- 
nised. All quite true — but the peo- 
ple of Altair Eight were quite con- 
tent to remain with us. Full scale 
war broke out. Our ancestors had 
prepared themselves for this day 
over a long period— it was obvious 
what the outcome would be. Inter- 
planetary missiles were launched 
from both Six and Eight timed to 
coincide with sabotage explosions 
on Seven itself.” 

“No quarter given in those 
days,” murmured DeGrazza. 

“It was them or us. The day 

34 



came when the entire planet of Al- 
tair Seven was shrouded in gigan- 
tic explosions. Half the population 
was watching from my own planet 
and what they saw was etched on 
their memories for a lifetime — and 
their children, born afterward saw 
it in their parents’ minds and their 
children. The memory of the dis- 
integration of Altair Seven persists 
to this day and with it, fear. It is 
hardly surprising that violence in 
any form is abhorrent to my peo- 
ple and timid self-preservation is 
now our primary characteristic.” 
“So Altair Seven became your 
asteroid belt,” observed DeGrazza. 

“The evidence of our shame will 
be visible forever. The belt is high- 
ly radioactive even now.” 

“Radioactive?” DeGrazza was 
struck by an idea. 

“Certainly.” 

“1 wonder — ” DeGrazza gazed 
at the radar screen, watching the 
multitude of moving sparks 
through which the computer, with 
frequent course corrections, was 
guiding them. 

“ UT if the brain is capable of 
overriding the computer at 
any time, then it must be the brain 
that is affected by radiation,” De- 
Grazza had said. 

And the Altairid, tiring of the 
argument which had become re- 
petitive, had replied once again. 
“The brain is shielded.” 

He had shown DeGrazza the 
cabinet behind which the brain 

IF 




resided and had assured the Earth- 
man that it was lead-lined and 
proof even against cumulative 
effect. 

So once again DeGrazza sat his 
solo watch, the alien dozing fitful- 
ly in his seat, the asteroids flicking 
past the viewscreen, the radar 
showing more and bigger to come. 
Two days to go and so far only the 
germ of an idea which might not, 
on this particular trip, be capable 
of any sort of proof. DeGrazza ex- 
amined his thoughts critically. 
Hell, he didn’t want the ship to hit 
an asteroid. On the other hand, he 
didn’t relish a string of uneventful 
trips, waiting for something to go 
wrong. 

So what do you want, DeGraz- 
za? What exactly are you hoping 
for in this night of stars? Are you 
sure that it is not death you are 
seeking, the quick death of escap- 
ing air and ruptured blood vessels 
which will release you for ever 
from the bonds of Mary and Cobb, 
the* freighter and radioactivity? Or 
is it that you welcome the timeless 
effect of space travel, feeling you 
stand still while others grow old? 
In such a fashion the pincers are 
eased, the converging jaws of past 
and future are stilled and the mind 
senses that last week is last week 
and next week is no closer because 
you, DeGrazza, are in a limbo an- 
ticline of space-antitime. And you 
deceive yourself, because every 
past second takes you into the 

TROUBLESHOOTER 



future. That future awaiting you 
when, as well you know, in the 
midst of the complex of relays and 
sensors and cell-tissue, so failsafe 
and foolproof and duplicated that 
nothing will go wrong. 

And yet something had gone 
wrong three standard days ago 
when the ship had apparently got- 
ten out of control momentarily 
and the Altairid had regained con- 
trol manually. There had been no 
problem because they had not been 
surrounded by flying chunks of 
rock. By the look of the radar now 
they were really in the thick of it — 
one asteroid ten degrees to star- 
board appeared as big as Iceland 
and there were other similar pieces 
about. 

Three days ago there had been 
few meteorites, yet the ship had 
veered off course. Was the radia- 
tion theory feasible? Briefly De- 
Grazza considered the explosive 
force of Altair VII creating some 
kind of invisible antimatter but re- 
jected the possibility as too far- 
fetched. 

The vast meteorite grew in the 
radar screen and he eyed it ner- 
vously, calculating how far to star- 
board it would pass, his stomach 
tense with the thought that this 
time, at a moment some few miles 
away, the brain computer might 
choose, perversely, to act up. 
There would be no question of 
sealing a few punctures and carry- 
ing on — the ship would be lost 

35 




without trace on that miniature 
planet, strewn about the radioac- 
tive crags. 

The asteroid, now occupying 
half the radar screen, crept into the 
corner of the viewscreen. Over the 
years DeGrazza had learned to re- 
ly on his hunches. His fingers hov- 
ered over the controls while his 
eyes watched the spreading land- 
scape of mountains, fissures and 
hard, jet shadow. He glanced at 
the alien beside him, eyelids flut- 
tering in half-sleep, and wondered 
if he should wake him. 

When the direction jets kicked, 
the violent movement nevertheless 
caught him only half-prepared and 
he was flung from his seat to the 
bulkhead. His head snapped back, 
smashing into the metal with a 
sick thud. He watched, helpless 
and dazed as the ship, veering, 
headed directly towards the jagged 
profusion of pinnacles . 

This is it, DeGrazza— this is the 
climax you have been waiting for. 
This is the instant when you will 
have to decide, once and forever, 
whether you want to live or die. 
Because you can die now easily — 
just by lying stunned, allowing 
your will for self preservation to 
ebb into the past, becoming weak- 
er with each successive moment as 
you comfortably slip into uncon- 
sciousness. You can die now if 
you want to. If you really want 
to. 

The features of the asteroid sur- 



face became clearer, nearer, ex- 
panding in the screen. Sharp silver 
crags, inky ravines, brief barren 
plains slid past. He saw dimly, 
swinging rapidly closer, a gigantic 
structure of shattered, twisted 
steelwork, throwing striding shad- 
ows across a rugged hillside. He 
screamed, struggling to reach the 
controls. Too weak to rise, he 
shook the limp form of the Al- 
tairid beside him. The dull eyes 
flickered open. 

“Contact the brain!” 

The alien’s eyes cleared. He 
glanced quickly at the screen. 
There was an infinitesimal pause, 
then the asteroid swung away, the 
landscape tilting. The stars reap- 
peared. They were back on course. 

DeGrazza, you live. That was 
what you wanted in the end. 

“T^OW perhaps you realize the 
advantages of the brain,” re- 
marked the alien some minutes la- 
ter. “It would have been impossi- 
ble to reach the controls in time 
but the brain responded instantly 
to my commands and overrode the 
incorrect course set by the radar 
and computer.” 

“You’re assuming too much,” 
muttered DeGrazza, still feeling 
dizzily sick. “Wait a moment,” he 
said suddenly. “You say that the 
brain will accept telepathic com- 
mands and obey them regardless 
of what the radar is picking up? I 
thought it was just the computer 

IF 



36 




that was bypassed.” He frowned. 

“Radar can go wrong, too. The 
possibility of a malfunction is in- 
herent in anything mechanical or 
electrical. Telepathic instructions 
therefore take precedence over any 
others.” 

“I see,” murmured DeGrazza. 

Malaise forgotten, interest and 
will to live restored, his mind dart- 
ed among the byways revealed by 
the new information. 

“Ask the brain why it changed 
course,” he said abruptly, never- 
theless feeling that this was too 
simple. There was some explana- 
tion in the back of his mind as to 
why this could not be done. 

“Impossible. The brain can only 
think in terms of numbers. It 
could not conceive the meaning of 
that type of question.” 

Of course. 

“Right, then,” said DeGrazza, 
knowing that he should have 
thought of this two days ago. 
“Ask the brain to repeat back the 
last few sequences of course cor- 
rections.” He had been so wrapped 
up in the notion of radiation and a 
brain/computer conflict that he 
had missed checking up on this ob- 
vious clue. Find out where the ship 
was headed and he might find out 
why, 

“That can be done,” agreed the 
Altairid. 

DeGrazza readied a stylus and 
pad. 

“278-125,” intoned the alien, 
eyes closed, concentrating on the 

TROUBLESHOOTER 



pictures relayed from the brain. 

DeGrazza wrote briskly. 

“279-127 — these are the present 
checks on the computer. It might 
take a while to get back.” 

“Carry on.” 

“279-126 — 279-125 — 279-127 
— 278-129 — Going back now. 

278- 128 — 198-128 — That was 
my evasive action. Nothing. 46- 
308-45-308—” 

“What’s that?” 

“46-308 — ” droned the Altairid. 
“46-310 — nothing — 279-128 — 

279- 129 — 278-129 — ” 

’’Back on course,” murmured 
DeGrazza. “This is before we went 
out of control. Wake up.” 

He nudged the alien who was 
still mumbling bearings as if hyp- 
notized. 

“You got the figures down?” 

“Yes, fine, thanks.” 

DeGrazza studied the pad, com- 
paring the list with the printout of 
the same bearings from the com- 
puter. 

“Do they mean anything to 
you?” 

“They mean one thing,” respond 
ed the Earthman grimly. “As far 
as the computer was concerned we 
were on the correct course. There’s 
no sign of 46- readings on the 
computer printout. Which proves 
that it was the brain, and only the 
brain, that sent us off course.” 

He showed the alien the lists. 

“46-308 — ” the alien read aloud. 
“45-308 — 46-308 — . That’s odd.”

THE PIECEMAKERS 

KEITH LAUMER 

A Retief story of war and 
piece — and fto wer po wer! 



I 

G entlemen,” Undersecre- 
tary for Extraterrestrial Af- 
fairs Thunderstroke announced in 
tones of doom, “it looks like 
war.” 

“What looks like war?” a stout 
man in plainly tailored civvies 
asked blurrily, as one just awak- 
ened from a pleasant nap. “War, 
you say?” He slapped the confer- 
ence table with a well-manicured 
hand. “Well, its about time we 
taught the beggars a lesson!” 
“You’ve leaped to a faulty con- 
clusion, Colonel,” the undersecre- 
tary said sourly. “We are not on 
the point of embarking on hostili- 
ties—” 

“Naturally not,” the military 
advisor said, rising. “Not your 
job. Civilians all very well— but 
time now for military to take over. 
You’ll excuse me, Mr. Secretary? 
I must rejoin my regiment at 
once — ” 

“Sit down, Henry,” the chief of 
the Groaci Desk said tiredly. 
“You haven’t got the big picture. 
No Terran forces are involved on 
Yudore at all. Strictly an Eetee 
affair.” 

“Sound thinking.” The colonel 
nodded approvingly. “Why throw 
away the lives of Terran lads when 
plenty of native lives are available 
for the purpose? To be given self- 
lessly in defense of sacred Terran 
principles, that is to say. By the 
way, which is our side?” 



“Try to grasp the point. Colo- 
nel,” the undersecretary said acid- 
ly. “We’re neutral in the affair.” 
“Of course— but whom are we 
neutral in favor of? Or in favor of 
whom, I should say, are we — ” 

“No one. And we intend to keep 
it that way.” 

“Umm.” The colonel resumed 
his seat and his nap. 

“It appears,” the undersecretary 
resumed, “that our old friends the 
Groaci are locked in an eyestalk- 
to-eyestalk confrontation with the 
Slox.” 

“What are these shlocks called, 
sir?” the acting assistant deputy 
undersecretary inquired in a tone 
of deep synthetic interest. 

“Slox, Magnan, S-l-o-x. Invet- 
erate trouble-makers from the 
Slox System, half a dozen lights 
in-Arm. Jt appears both they and 
the Groaci are claiming mandate- 
ship of Yudore, an unexceptional 
planet of a small Class G sun well 
off the trade routes.” 

“Well, why doesn’t one of them 
just go mandate somewhere else?” 
a commerce man demanded. 
“There are scads of available plan- 
ets out that way.” 

“The Groaci state that Yudore 
falls within their natural sphere of 
influence,” Thunderstroke said. 
“As for the Slox, their position is 
that they found the place first.” 

“^^HEY could flip a coin for 
A it,” the commerce man 
snapped. “Then we could all get

back to matters of importance, 
such as the abnormal rate of in- 
crease in the rate of decrease of 
the expansion of the trend toward 
reduction of increasing berp-nut 
consumption among unwed fathers 
ages nine through ninety on back- 
ward worlds of the Nicodeman 
group, a development which I just 
detected this morning through the 
use of refined psychostatistical 
techniques.” 

“Good lord, Chester — ” a polit- 
ical forecast specialist picked up 
the cue — “what will be the pro- 
jected impact of this downturn in 
the upturn?” 

“Upturn of the downturn, if you 
must use layman’s language,” 
Chester corrected. “Why, at the 
present rate it appears that by fis- 
cal ’ninety-seven there’ll be a rec- 
ord high in unwed fathers.” 

“To return to the subject at 
hand, gentlemen,” Thunderstroke 
cut in ominously, “both parties to 
the dispute have dispatched battle 
fleets to stand by off Yudore, 
primed for action.” 

“Hmm. Seems to me there’s a 
solution of sorts implicit in that 
datum,” someone murmured. 

“Let us hope not. An outbreak 
of hostilities would blot our copy- 
books badly, gentlemen.” Thun- 
derstroke glared at the offender. 
“Unfortunately the Groaci ambas- 
sador has assured me privately 
that his government’s position is 
unalterable. Groaci doctrine, as he 
explained matters, makes accom-

modation with what he terms ‘vile- 
smelling opportunists’ impossible, 
while a spokesman for the Slox 
has announced they refuse to yield 
an inch to the ‘five-eyed sticky fin- 
gers — ’ as he calls the opposition 
party.” 

“It sounds like a major policy 
blunder cm the part of the Groa- 
ci,” Magnan observed contentedly, 
“How refreshing that for once the 
CDT is not involved.” 

“We could hardly be said to be 
uninvolved, Mr. Magnan,” Thun- 
derstroke pointed out sternly, “if 
we undertake to mediate the dis- 
pute.” 

“No, I suppose not — but why be 
pessimistic? Who would be idiot 
enough to suggest poking our nose 
into that bag of annelids?” 

“As it happens,” Thunderstroke 
said in a voice like an iceberg slid- 
ing into an Arctic sea, “I did!” 
“You, sir?” Magnan croaked. 
“Why, what a splendid notion — 
now that I’ve had time to consider 
it in depth, I mean.” 

A fragile-looking acting section 
chief sprang to the undersecre- 
tary’s support. 

“After all, our function as dip- 
lomats is to maintain interplane- 
tary tensions at a level short of 
violence.” 

“Would you want to make that 
‘reduce tensions,’ Chester?” the in- 
formation agency representive in- 
quired, pencil poised. “Just in case 
you’re quoted out of context.” 

“No reporters,” Thunderstroke

decreed. “I shudder to think what 
critics of the Corps might make of 
any little slip in our part in this af- 
fair.” 

“I suppose you’ll be sending 
along a hundred-man Conciliation 
Team with a squadron of Peace 
Enforcers to deal with the mat- 
ter,” Magnan said, a speculative 
look on his narrow features. 

“Hardly,” Thunderstroke said 
flatly. “This is a job for finesse, 
not brute diplomacy. In a situa- 
tion of this nature, a single shrewd, 
intrepid, coolly efficient negotiator 
is the logical choice.” 

“Of course, sir, how shallow of 
me not to have seen it at once.” 
Magnan pursed his lips thought- 
fully. “Naturally, the task calls 
for a man of wide experience — ” 
“With a total contempt for 
deadly personal danger,” someone 
put in. 

“Preferably without a family,” 
Magnan added, nodding. 

“Too bad that lets me out,” a 
deputy assistant undersecretary 
said briskly. “As you know. I’m 
the sole support of twelve cats and 
a most demanding parakeet — ” 

“I wasn’t thinking of you, Hen- 
ry,^’ Thunderstroke said severely. 
“I had in mind a senior diplomat, 
a man of lofty IQ, unshakable 
principle and unquestioned dexter- 
ity in the verbal arena.” 

“Good lord, sir,” Magnan 
blurted. “I appreciate your confi- 
dence, but my duties here — ” 
“Unfortunately,” Thunder- 



stroke bored on, “the files have 
failed to produce the nanue of any 
such paragon. Hence I must make 
do with the material at hand.” 
“Well!” Magnan muttered un- 
der his breath, then paled as Thun- 
derstroke fixed him with an impe- 
rious eye. 

“I assume your inoculations are 
in order?” the undersecretary in- 
quired coldly. 

“Mine, sir?” Magnan said, 
pushing his chair back and rising 
hastily. “Actually, my hayfever 
shot is due in half an hour — ” 

“I suggest you ask for a heavy 
dosage of anti-radiation drugs 
while you’re there,” the assistant 
for ET affairs said cheerfully. 
“And of course a tetanus shot 
wouldn’t do any harm.” 

“Kindly be seated, Magnan,” 
Thunderstroke barked. “Now, 
you’ll 'be going in in a plainly 
marked courier vessel. I suggest 
you exercise caution as you ap- 
proach the battle flotillas. The 
Slox are said to be even more trig- 
ger-happy than the notoriously im- 
petuous Groaci.” 

“I’m to go into that hornet’s 
nest, sir — in an unarmed boat?” 
“You’ll be armed with instruc- 
tions, Magnan. Buck up, man. 
This is no time to show the white 
feather.” 

Magnan sank into his chair. 
“As for myself. I’m delighted, of 
course,” he said breathlessly. “I 
was just thinking of all those inno- 
cent crew members.” 



42

“I’d considered that aspect, 
Magnan. And of course you’re 
right. It would be folly to risk the 
lives of an entire crew.” 

Magnan brightened. 

“Therefore, you’ll be dropped a 
fractional A.U. from the scene of 
action in a fast one-man scout.” 

.“A one man boat? But — ” Mag- 
nan paused. “But unfortunately,” 
he went on ia tones of relief, “I 
don’t know how to pilot one.” 

“Why not?” Thunderstroke de- 
manded. 

“Sector regs discourage it,’’ 
Magnan said crisply. “Only last 
month a chap in my department 
received a severe dressing down for 
engaging in acrobatics over Lake 
Prabchinc — ” 

“Oh? What’s this fellow’s 
name?” 

“Retief, sir. But as I said, he’s 
already received a reprimand, so it 
won’t be necessary — ” 

“Retief.” Thunderstroke made 
a note. “Very well. Make that a 
two-man scout, Magnan.” 

“But—” 

“No buts, Magnan. This is war 
— or it will be if you fail. And time 
is of the essence. I’ll expect you 
and this Retief fellow to be on the 
way to the battle zone within the 
hour.” 

“But sir — two diplomats against 
two fleets?” 

“Hm. Phrased in that fashion, it 
does sound a bit unfair. Still — 
they started it. Let them take the 
consequences.” 

THE PIECEAAAKERS 



S TRAPPED into the confining 
seat of the thirty-foot skiff, 
waiting in the drop-bay of the 
Corps transport, Magnan watched 
the launch clock nervously. 

“Actually,” he said, “the under- 
secretary had his heart set on a 
one-man mission — but at my in- 
sistence he agreed to send me 
along with you.” 

“I wondered who my benefactor 
was,” Retief said. “Nice to know 
you were thinking of me.” 

“Retief — are you implying — ” 
Magnan broke off as the voice of 
the captain of the mother ship 
rang from the panel speaker. 

“Fifteen seconds, gentlemen. 
Say, I hope your policies are all 
paid up. From what my translator 
tells me about the transmissions 
those boys are exchanging up 
ahead, you’re going to arrive just 
in time for M minute.” 

“I wish he’d trip the launch le- 
ver,” Magnan snapped. “I’ll be 
profoundly happy to depart this 
hulk, if only to be away from that 
gloating voice.” 

“I heard that,” the captain said. 
“What’s the matter, no sense of 
humor?” 

“I’m convulsed,” Magnan said. 
“Better unconvulse,” came the 
swift suggestion. “This is it. Hap- 
py landings — ” 

There was a slam of relays, a 
thud, a jolt that dimmed the pas- 
sengers’ vision for a long, dizzying 

43 




moment. When it cleared, black 
space dotted with fiery points 
glared from the screens. Astern, 
the transport dwindled and was 
gone. 

“I’m picking them up already,’’ 
Retief said, manipulating the con- 
trols of the R-screen. “Our dare- 
devil captain dropped us practical- 
ly in their midst.’’ 

“Has the shooting started?’’ 
Magnan gasped. 

“Not yet. But from the look of 
those battle formations it won’t be 
long.’’ 

“Maybe we ought to transmit 
our plea for peace. from here,” 
Magnan said hurriedly. “Some- 
thing eloquent to appeal to their 
finer natures, with just a smidgin 
of veiled threat on the side.” 

“I have a feeling it’s going to 
take more than sparkling conver- 
sation to stop these fellows,” Re- 
tief said. “Anybody who owns a 
new battlewagon has a natural yen 
to see if it works.” 

“I’ve been thinking,” Magnan 
said abruptly. “You know how 
short the CDT is of trained per- 
sonnel — now that we’ve seen the 
hopelessness of the task, it’s our 
duty to salvage what we can from 
the debacle. Besides, an eyewitness 
report will be of inestimable value 
to the undersecretary when the 
board of inquiry starts digging in- 
to the question of how he allowed 
a war to start right under our 
noses.” 

“I’m with you so far, sir.” 



“That being the case,” Magnan 
went on quickly, “if you should in- 
sist on withdrawing from the scene 
at this point, I hardly see how I 
could prevent you.” 

“You’re in command, Mr. 
Magnan,” Retief pointed out. 
“But I have a distinct feeling that 
our reception back at Sector 
would be less then enthisiastic if we 
don’t have at least a few blast 
burns on the hull to show for our 
trouble.” 

“But, Retief!” Magnan pointed 
at the screen on which the long, 
deadly-looking shape of a Groaci 
cruiser was growing steadily. 
“Look at that monster, bristling 
with guns from stem to stern. How 
can you reason with that kind of 
firepower?” 

A t that moment a crackle 
oT static blared from the 
screen. A pale, alien visage with 
five stalked eyes stared out at the 
Terrans from under a flared war 
helmet. 

“To identify yourselves at once, 
rash interlopers,” a weak voice 
hissed in sibilant Groaci. “To be 
gone instantly or suffer dire conse- 
quences — ” 

“Why, if it isn’t Broodmaster 
Slith!” Magnan cried. “Retief, it’s 
Broodmaster Slith. You remem- 
ber Broodmaster Slith of the Gro- 
acian Trade Mission to Haunch 
Four?” 

“Is it you, Magnan?” the Gro- 
aci grated. “When last we met you

IF 




were meddling in Groaci affairs 
under the guise of selfless uplifter, 
disrupting peaceful commerce. In 
what role do you now intrude in 
Groacian space?” 

“Now, Slith, you have to con- 
fess it was a bit much, selling plas- 
tic frankfurters to those poor 
backward hot-dog lovers — ” 

“How were we to know their in- 
ferior metabolisms were incapable 
of assimilating wholesome poly- 
styrenes?” Slith snarled. “Enough 
of this chatter. Withdraw at once 
or take full responsibility for pre- 
cipitation of a regrettable inci- 
dent.” 

“Now, don’t be hasty. Brood- 
master — ” 

“You may address me as Grand 
Commander of Avenging Flotillas 
Slith, if you please. As for haste, 
it is a virtue I recommend to you. 
In sixty seconds I order my gun- 
ners to fire.” 

“I suggest you reconsider. Com- 
mander,” Retief said. “At the first 
shot from your guns, three will get 
you five the Slox open up on you 
with everything they’ve got.” 
“What matter? Let the miscre- 
ants invoke the full wrath of out- 
raged Groacihood.” 

“At a rough count, they have 
thirty-one ships to your twenty- 
four,” Retief pointed out. “I think 
they’ve got you out-wrathed.” 

“But what’s all this talk of 
shooting?” Magnan cried. “What 
could possibly be gained by gun- 
fire?” 



“Certain parcels of real estate, 
for a starter,” Slith said crisply. 
“Plus the elimination of certain 
alien vermin.” 

Magnan gasped. “You confess 
you’re here to take Yudore by 
force?” 

“Hardly — not that the matter is 
of any concern to Terran spies. 
My mission here is to prevent the 
invasion of hapless Yudore by the 
insidious Slox — ” 

“I hear this,” a rasping, high- 
pitched voice cut in from the aux- 
iliary screen. It was accompanied 
by a hissing of background noise. 
A wavering image formed on the 
tube, steadied into the form of a 
shiny, purplish-red cranium, long 
and narrow, knobbed and spiked. 
.A pair of yellow eyes were 
mounted on outriggers that pro- 
jected a foot on either side. “I out- 
rage! I do not endure! You are 
gave one minutes. Eastern Stan- 
dard Timef for total abandon of 
vicinity! Counting! Nine, twelve, 
two, several — ” 

“What — what is it?’’ Magnan 
gasped, staring at the newcomer to 
the conversation. 

“Aha — collusion between Soft 
One and Slox!” Slith keened. “I 
see it now! You thought to dis- 
tract my attention with an ex- 
change of civilities while your vile 
cronies executed a sneak at- 
tack — ” 

“I — Chief General Okkyokk — 
chum to these monstrositaries?” 
The Slox spokesman screeched.

“Such indignant my language 
lack! Insufficient you threaten to 
lowly benefits of Slox Protector- 
ate — but addition of insults! My 
goodness! Drat! Other obscenity 
as required!” 

“It will not avail you to rant,” 
Slith whispered in a venomous 
tone. “My guns stand ready to an- 
swer your slurs — ” 

“Only incredible restrains of 
high-class Slox general intrudes 
herself to spare those skinny 



neck!” Okkyokk yelled in reply. 

“Gentlemen, don’t get carried 
away,” Magnan called over the 
hiss of static. “I’m sure this can 
all be worked out equitably — 

“Unless this pernicious meddler 
in the Groaci destiny disperses his 
flimsy hulls at once. I’ll not be re- 
sponsible for the result,” Slith de- 
clared. 

“My frustrate!’’ Okkyokk 
yelled and brandished a pair of an- 
terior limbs tipped with compli- 




cated shredding devices. “Gosh, 
such wish to know sensation of 
plait all five eyes into single super- 
ocular, followed by pluck like ob- 
scene daisy — “ 

“To wait in patience until the 
happy moment when I officiate at 
your burial, head-down, in the cer- 
emonial sand-box,” Slith count- 
ered. 

“Well, at least they’re still 
speaking to each other,” Magnan 
said as the exchange raged on. 
“That’s something..” 

“We may get through this with- 
out any hull-burns after all,” Re- 
tief said. “They have each other 
bluffed. It looks like talk rather 
than torpedoes will carry the day. 
I suggest we execute a strategic 
withdrawal while they slug it out, 
vocabulary-to-vocabulary.” 

“Hmm. Scant points in that for 
Terran diplomacy. Duty demands 
that we play a more creative role 
in the rapprochmenty Magnan put 
a finger against his narrow chin. 
“Now, if I should be the one to 
propose an equitable solution — ” 

“Let’s not remind them we’re 
here, Mr. Magnan,” Retief sug- 
gested. “Frustrated tempers are 
often taken out in thrown crockery 
and we’d make a convenient tea- 
cup — ” 

“Nonsense, they’d never dare.” 
Magnan leaned forward. “Gentle- 
men,” he called over the din of 
battle. “I have the perfect solution. 
Since there seems to be some lack 
of confidence on the part of each 

THE PIECEAAAKERS 



of you in the benign intentions of 
the other, I propose that Yudore 
be placed under a Terran Protec- 
torate.” Magnan smiled expec- 
tantly. 

T here was an instant of total 
silence as two sets of alien 
sense organs froze, oriented to- 
ward the interruption. Slith was 
the first to break the paralysis. 

“What? Leave the fruits of Gro- 
aci planning to Terran harvesting? 
Never.” 

“I convulse!’* Okkyokk howled. 
“I exacerbate! I froth at buccal 
cavity! How are you invite? Mer- 
cy! Heavens to Marmaduke! Et 
cetera!” 

“Gentlemen,’’ Magnan said. 
“We Terrans would only remain 
on Yudore until such time as the 
aborigines had been properly edu- 
cated in modern commercial meth- 
ods and sexual hygiene, after 
which we’d withdraw in favor of lo- 
cal self-determination!” 

“First to pervert, then to aban- 
don!” Slith hissed. “Bold threats. 
Soft Ones! But I defy you! Gener- 
al Okkyokk! I propose a truce 
while we band together to confront 
the common enemy.” 

“Done! Caramba! I effronter- 
ize! I mortal insult! I even annoy! 
First destruction we the kibitzer! 
Then proceedure to Slox-Groaci 
quarrel!” 

“Wait!” Magnan yelped. “You 
don’t understand — ” 

“I’m afraid they do,” Retief 

47 




said as he reached for the controls. 
“Hang on for evasive action, Mr. 
Magnan.” The tiny craft leaped 
ahead, curvetting wildly left and 
right. There was a flash and the 
screens went white and blanked 
out. The boat bucked wildly and 
flipped end-for-end. A second det- 
onation sent it spinning like a flat 
stone skipped over a pond. 

“Retief — stop! We’re headed 
straight for no-man’s land!’’ Mag- 
nan gasped as a lone screen flick- 
ered back to life, showing a vast 
Groaci battlewagon swelling dead 
ahead. 

“We’re going in under their 
guns,” Retief snapped. “Running 
away, we’d be a sitting duck.” 

“Maybe they’ll let us surren- 
der,” Magnan bleated. “Can’t we 
run out a white flag or some- 
thing?” 

“I’m afraid it would just give 
them an aiming point.” Retief 
wrenched the boat sideways, rode 
out another near miss, dove under 
the big ship’s stern. 

“Look out — ” Magnan 
screamed as a vast, mottled blue- 
green disk slid onto the screen. 
“We’ll crash on Yudore — ” 

“If we’re lucky,” Retief agreed. 
Then the rising keening of splitting 
air made further conversation im- 
possible. 

Ill 

E xcept for the fading hiss of 
escaping air and the ping of 



hot metal contracting, the only 
sounds audible in the shattered 
cockpit were Magnan’s groans as 
he extricated himself from the 
wreckage of his contour chair. 
Through a rent in the hull, yellow 
sunlight glared on the smoking 
ruins of the scout boat’s control 
panel, the twisted and buckled 
floor plates, the empty pilot’s seat. 

“Glad to see you’re awake,’’ 
Retief said. Magnan turned his 
aching head to see his companion 
leaning in the open escape hatch, 
apparently intact but for a bruise 
on the cheekbone and a burned 
patch on the front of his powder- 
blue blazer. “The air’s a little thin 
but the O2 content seems ade- 
quate. How do you feel?” 

“Ghastly,” Magnan confided. 
He fumbled his shock harness free 
and groped his way through the 
hatch to drop down shakily on a 
close-cropped peach-colored 
sward. All around, tall, treelike 
growths with ribbed red-orange 
trunks rose into the pale sky, sup- 
porting masses of spongy tanger- 
ine-toned foliage. Clumps of yel- 
low, amber and magenta blossoms 
glowed in the shade like daubs of 
fluorescent paint. 

“Why are we still alive?” the 
senior diplomat inquired dazedly. 
“The last thing I remember is a 
pale pink mountain sticking up 
through a cloud bank directly in 
our path.” 

“We missed it,’’ Retief reas- 
sured his chief. “There was just

enough power left on our plates to 
cushion touchdown. That and a lot 
of springy foliage saved our 
necks.” 

“Where are we?” 

“On a small island in the north- 
ern hemisphere, which seems to be 
the only land on the planet. That’s 
about as specific as I can be, I’m 
afraid — and I designated the north 
pole arbitrarily at that.” 

“Well — let’s get it over with.” 
Magnan sighed, looking around. 
“Where are they? I suggest we 
throw ourselves on Slitch’s mercy. 
Frankly, I don’t trust that Ok- 
kyokk — there’s something shifty 
about those cantilevered oculars 
of his.” 

“I’m afraid we won’t be able to 
surrender immediately,” Retief 
said. “Our captors haven’t yet ar- 
rived.” 

“Hmm. Doubtless they’re mak- 
ing a somewhat less precipituous 
approach than we. I suppose we 
might as well make ourselves com- 
fortable.” 

“On the other hand,” Retief 
said reasonably, “why wait 
around?” 

“What other hope of rescue 
have we?” 

“1 don’t think either party 
would make the ideal host — as- 
suming they bother with live pri- 
soners in the first place.” 

“You’re implying that Slith — a 
fellow bureaucrat — a being with 
whom I’ve shared many a convivi- 
al cup — would acquiesce to our ex-

ecution out of hand?” Magnan 
gasped. 

“He might. If he didn’t do the 
job himself.” 

“Heavens, Retief, what are we 
to do? How far do you suppose it 
is to the nearest native village?” 

“1 didn’t see any signs of civili- 
zation on the way down — no 
towns, no roads or cleared fields. 
Let’s give a listen on the long-wave 
bands.” Retief climbed back into 
the wrecked craft, investigated the 
shock-mounted TRX, spliced a 
number of broken wires and 
twirled the knob. Nothing but 
faint static. He switched to the 
ship-to-ship frequency. 

“ — blundering two-eyed incom- 
petent!” Slith’s furious voice came 
through loud and clear. “Your 
broken-down excuse for a flagship 
was closer to them than my own 
superb standard-bearer. It was 
your responsibility to blast them 
from space — ” 

“My indignant! My furious! 
Heck! Darn! This accuse from a 
Five-eyes margarine-fingers! I in- 
tolerate! Too bad!” 

“Have done! These vitupera- 
tions avail us not at all. If the Soft 
Ones survive to make known that 
we fired on a Terran vessel — in 
self-defense, of course — horde of 
their execrable Peace Enforcers 
will descend on us like bim beetles 
in grub-harvest time.” 

“I proposterate! My laughter! 
Your numbskull! Alive, oh! After 
such crashing, entirely! No, unpos-

sible; I rediculate! Au contraire, I 
suggestion my resumption our dis- 
pute. Where were? Indeed, yes — 
my descriptioning your ances- 
try-” 

“Hark, mindless one! Like oth- 
er low forms of life, the Soft Ones 
are tenacious of vitality. We must 
make sure of their demise. Hence, 
I shall descend to administer the 
coup de grace to any survivors, 
while you stand by off-planet — or, 
preferably, withdraw to neutral 
space — ” 

“So you enable to theft these 
planet, unoppositioned? My 
amuse! My hylerical! Goodness 
me! I accompanate, quite so!” 

“Very well— if you insist. You 
may accompany me aboard my 
personal gunboat. I’ll designate a 
modest destroyer escort to convoy 
us down to the surface.” 

“Nix. I preference to my own 
vessel, gratitudes anyhow. And my 
bring few Slox cruiser in order to 
not lonesome.” 

“Cruisers?” Slith said harshly. 
“In that case I think a pair of Gro- 
aci battleships would be in order — 
just to balance the formation, you 
understand.” 

“Combination operate incom- 
pletion— unless Slox battlewagon 
also include.” 

“Actually,” Slith hissed, “I see 
no reason not to bring my entire 
fleet along — just in case you 
should entertain ideas of a sneak 
attack during my absence.” 

“My agreeness! I, too! The 



more the merriment! Gracious 
me! Full speed ahead! Devil take 
the hind parts!” 

“Agreed! Roger and out,” Slith 
snapped. 

“Good heavens, Retief,” Mag- 
nan muttered, “those two madmen 
are going to stage a full-scale inva- 
sion just to keep an eye on each 
other.” 

“No one could accuse us now of 
having failed to influence the 
course of Slox-Groaci relations,” 
Retief said calmly. “Well, let’s be 
off. We have about an hour before 
they arrive.” 

Quickly he detached the com- 
pact radio from its mountings, ex- 
tracted an emergency ration pack 
from the debris. 

“Which way?” Magnan queried 
worriedly, staring at the deep or- 
ange shade of the forest all 
around. 

“Take your choice, Mr. Mag- 
nan,” Retief said, indicating the 
four points of the compass. “Eee- 
nie, meenie, miney or moe.” 

“Hmm. I think perhaps due 
meenie. It looks a tiny bit less for- 
bidding. Or possibly just a few 
points to the miney of meenie.” 

“Meenie by miney it is,” Retief 
said and led the way into the tall 
timber. 

“¥J ETIEF — I’m utterly ex- 

-I^hausted,’’ Magnan panted 
three quarters of an hour and^ 
three miles from the wrecked 
scout boat.

IF 




“We’re not yet clear,” Retief 
said. “We’d better keep going and 
rest later.” 

“I’d soon face a Groaci firing 
squad as die of heart failure and 
heat prostration.” Magnan sank 
down on the yielding turf, lay 
breathing in great gulps. 

“How about a Slox skinning 
party?” Retief suggested. “I un- 
derstand they start with the scalp 
and work downward — like peeling 
a banana.” 

“Jape if you must.” Magnan 
groaned. “I’m past caring.” He 
sat up suddenly, staring suspi- 
ciously at a small, bell-shaped 
blossom with petals of a delicate 
shade of coral pink. 

“Bees,” he said distastefully. 
“Allergic as I am even to Terran 
insects, a sting from an alien form 
would probably be instantly fatal.” 
“Still, as you pointed out, one 
demise is pretty much like anoth- 
er,” Retief consoled his superior. 
“If it actually was a bee you saw, 
it’s the first native animal life to 
make its presence known.” 

“I didn’t see it but I heard it dis- 
tinctly,” Magnan said severely. “It 
buzzed practically in my ear.” 
“This is a rather curious for- 
est,” Retief observed. “Only one 
variety of tree, one kind of grass, 
one type of flower — in assorted 
sizes and colors. But no weeds. No 
parasitic vines. No big trees 
crowding out smaller ones, no 
stunted growth. Not even any 
deadfalls.” 

THE PIECEAAAKERS 



Magnan grunted. 

“Retief, suppose for the nonce 
we succeed in eluding capture — 
what then? Nobody knows we’re 
here. How will we ever be res- 
cued?” 

“Interesting question, Mr. Mag- 
nan.” 

“Not that it matters a great 
deal,” Magnan went on morosely. 
“With my mission a failure — 
worse than a failure — my career is 
in ruins. Do you realize that if it 
hadn’t been for our meddling this 
invasion would probably never 
have come to pass?” 

“The thought had occurred to 
me,” Retief conceded. 

“To say nothing of the loss of 
the scout-boat. If the undersecre- 
tary holds me responsible — holds 
us responsible, I should say — that 
is, in the event he doesn’t hold you 
personally responsible, Retief, as 
pilot — why, you’ll be years paying 
it off,” he went on more cheerful- 
ly. “Still, I’ll put in a word for 
you. After all, Slith was shooting 
at us.” 

“There is that.” 

“And actually, who’s to say it 
was my friendly attempt to offer a 
compromise that precipitated the 
invasion? I daresay the hotheads 
would have embarked on their con- 
quest in any event.” 

“Possibly,” Retief agreed. 

“By engaging them in conversa- 
tion I doubtless delayed the inevi- 
table for a — a length of time.” 

“Several seconds at least.”

“Relief, by offering myself as a 
sacrifice on the alter of inter-being 
chumship I may have saved count- 
less lives.” 

“I suppose a certain number of 
bacteria were lost in our crash 
landing,” Relief sarcastically 
pointed out. 

“You scoff,” Magnan charged. 
“But history will vindicate my 
stand. Why, I wouldn’t be sur- 
prised if a special posthumous 
medal were struck — ” He broke 
off with a start. “There it is 
again — ” He scrambled up. “It 
sounded like an enraged hornet. 
Where did it go?” 

Relief cocked his head, listen- 
ing, then leaned over to examine 
the clump of apricot-colored flow- 
ers nodding on long stems, beside 
which Magnan had been sitting. 

“Don’t waste time plucking 
nosegays,” Magnan yelped. “I’m 
under attack — ” 

“Mr. Magnan, I don’t think 
there are any insects in the vicini- 
ty” 

“Eh? Why, I can hear them 
quite plainly.” Magnan frowned. 
“It sounds like one of those old 
fashioned hand-crank telephones 
still in use out on Jawbone. When 
you leave it off the hook.” 

“Close, Mr. Magnan,” Relief 
said and leaned down to put his 
ear close to the trumpet-shaped 
bloom. 

“Well, I thought you’d never 
speak,” a tiny voice said distinctly 
in his ear. 



B uzzing blossoms is quite 
fantastic enough,” Magnan 
said wonderingly. “But talking tu- 
lips? Who’d ever believe it?” 

“. somebody to converse 
with,” the cricket-sized voice was 
saying. “I’m dying to know all the 
news. Now, just tell me all about 
yourself — your hopes, your 

dreams, how you happened to be 
here — everything — ” 

Relief held a blossom to his lips 
as if it were indeed the mouthpiece 
of a phone. 

“I’m Relief. This is my col- 
league, Mr. Magnan. Whom have 
we the honor of addressing?” 

“Well, nice to know you. Re- 
lief. And Mister Magnan, too. 
May I call you Mister for short? 
First nam'es are so much more 
sort of informal. I’m Herby. Just 
a nickname, of course. Actually I 
don’t have a name. At least I 
didn’t have until dear Renfrew 
came along. You have no idea 
what a sheltered life I’d led until 
then. Why, do you know I had the 
idea I was the only sentient intelli- 
gence in the Galaxy?” 

“Who are you?” Magnan 
blurted. “Where are you? Why is 
the microphone camouflaged to 
look like a plant?” 

“Camouflage? Why, there’s no 
camouflage. Mister. You see me 
just as I am.” 

“But I don’t see you at all,” 
Magnan complained, looking 

IF 



52 




around warily. “Where are you 
hiding?” 

“You’re squeezing me at this 
very moment,” Herby said. 

“You mean — ” Magnan held 
the faintly aromatic blossom at 
arm’s length and stared at it. 

“You mean — I’m — you’re — 
we’re — ” 

“Now you’re getting the idea,” 
the voice said encouragingly. 

“Talking flowers — here, in the 
middle of nowhere — and speaking 
Terran at that? I must be halluci- 
nating. Tve been driven mad by 
hardship.” 

“I doubt it, Mr. Magnan,” Re- 
tief said soothingly. “I hear it, 
too.” 

“If I can imagine I hear voices 
coming out of posies I can imag- 
ine your hearing them too,” Mag- 
nan retorted tartly. 

“Oh, I’m real enough,” the 
voice said reassuringly. “Why 
should you doubt me?” 

“Who taught you to speak Ter- 
ran?” Retief asked. 

“Renfrew. I learned so much 
from him. Curious — but before he 
came, it never occurred to me to 
be lonely.” 

“Who is Renfrew?” 

“A friend. A very dear friend.” 

“Retief, this is fantastic,” Mag- 
nan whispered. “Are there — are 
there many like you?” he inquired 
of the bloom. 

“No — ^just me. After all, there’d 
hardly be room, you know — ” 

“A coincidence,” Magnan ex- 

THE PIECEAAAKERS 



claimed. “One talking plant on the 
entire world and we stumble on it 
in the first hour. I’m beginning to 
think our luck is still holding.” 
“Now, where are you from, if 
you don’t mind my asking?” the 
plant inquired. 

“We’re Terrans,” Magnan said. 
“And I’m sure we’re going to get 
on famously, Herby.” 

“But— I understood Terra was 
the name of Renfrew’s home plan- 
et.” 

“Quite so. Marvelous place. 
You’d love it, now that all the jun- 
gles have been cleared and re- 
placed by parking lots — ” Magnan 
caught himself. “Ah, no offense 
intended, of course. Some of my 
best friends are plants.” 

“Heavens — all three of you 
from one planet? No wonder you 
left. Such overcrowding — ” 

“Yes — now, Mr. Herby, if you 
could just tell us the way to the 
nearest native settlement — ” 
“Buildings, you mean? Streets, 
spaceports, that sort of thing?” 
“Yes. Preferably not one of 
these dismal provincial towns. 
Something in a modest metropolis 
will do.” 

“Sorry, there isn’t one — though 
Renfrew told me about them.” 
Magnan groaned. “No towns at 
all? Then—” 

“Just jungle.” 

“If this fellow Renfrew has a 
ship we may be able to catch a 
ride with him. I wonder — could we 
meet him?” 



53 




“Well — I suppose so, Mister. 
He’s quite nearby as it happens.’’ 

“He’s still here, then?’’ 

“Oh, yes indeed.’’ 

“Saved,” Magnan breathed in 
relief. “Can you direct us, Her- 
by?” 

“Certainly. Just press on mee- 
nie, bearing a little to the miney 
after you cross the stream, then 
hard moe at the lake. You can’t 
miss him.” 

Magnan looked startled. “How 
did you know?” He frowned at 
Retief in puzzlement. “I thought 
we named the local directions.” 

“Oh, indeed,” Herby spoke up. 
“I merely employed your own no- 
menclature.” 

“You must have a fantastic 
ear,” Magnan said wonderingly. 
“That discussion was held miles 
from here.” 

“I don’t miss much,’’ Herby 
said complacently. 

“He’s remarkably sophisticated 
for such a modest bloom,” Mag- 
nan commented as they started 
off. 

“I suspect most of Herby is un- 
derground, Mr. Magnan,” Retief 
pointed out. “There’s no room for 
a speech center in the part we 
saw.” 

“Gad — a subterranean cerebrum 
— like a giant potato?” Magnan 
said uneasily, treading lightly. “A 
spooky thought, Retief.” 

Twenty minutes’ brisk hike 
brought the two Terrans to the 
shore of a small, gurgling brook 

54 



overhung with majestically arch- 
ing foliage. They followed the 
bank to the right for a quarter of 
a mile, at which point the waters 
spilled down in a foaming amber 
cataract into a placid pond a half- 
mile across. 

“So far so good,” Magnan said 
uncertainly. “But I see no signs of 
habitation, not even a hut, to say 
nothing of a ship.” 

Retief moved past Magnan to- 
ward a dense thicket that obtruded 
somewhat from the smooth line of 
trees edging the lakeshore. He 
parted the broad, copper-colored 
leaves, revealing a surface of rust- 
pitted metal curving away into the 
dimness. 

“Lousy Ann Two,” he read the 
corroded letters welded to the 
crumbling hull plates. “Looks like 
we’ve found Renfrew’s ship.” He 
pulled a law-growing branch aside. 
“And here’s Renfrew.” 

“Splendid!” Magnan hurried up, 
halted abruptly to stare in horror 
at the heap of mouldering bones 
topped by a grinning skull still 
wearing a jaunty yachting cap. 
“That’s Renfrew?” he quavered. 
“Quite so,” said a deep voice 
from somewhere overhead. “And 
take my word for it. Mister — it’s 
been a long, lonely time since he 
sat down there.” 

“rwiwO hundred years, give or 
-I take a decade or two,” Re- 
tief said as he climbed out through 
the derelict’s sagging port, brush- 

IF 




ing the dust and rust scale from 
his hands. “She was a Concordiat- 
registered racing sloop, converted 
for long-range cruising. What’s 
left of the crew quarters suggests 
she was fitted out for one-man op- 
eration.” 

“That’s right,” agreed the reso- 
nant baritone— which, the Terrans 
had determined, emanated from a 
large, orchid-like blossom sprout- 
ing amid the foliage twenty feet 
above their heads. “Just Renfrew. 
It was a small world he inhabited 
but he seemed content with it. Not 
that he was stand-offish, of course. 
He was as friendly as could be — 
right up until the difficulty about 
his leaving.” 

“What sort of difficulty?” Mag- 
nan inquired. 

“He seemed quite upset that his 
vessel was unable to function. I 
did my best to console him — re- 
galed him with stories and poems, 
sang merry songs — ” 

“Where did you learn them?” 
Magnan cut in sharply. “I under- 
stood Renfrew was the first Ter- 
ran to visit here.” 

“Why, from him, of course.” 

“Good lord — imagine having 
your own chestnuts endlessly re- 
peated back at you,” Magnan 
whispered behind his hand. 

“Did you ever tell a joke to an 
ambassador?” Retief inquired. 

“A telling point,” Magnan con- 
ceded. “But at least they usually 
add a little variety by garbling the 
punchline.” 

THE PIECEAAAKERS 



“How did Renfrew happen to 
crash-land here?” Retief inquired. 

“Oh, he didn’t. He came to rest 
very gently.” 

“Then why couldn’t he take off 
again?” Magnan demanded. 

“I believe he described it as for- 
eign matter in the warpilator field 
windings,” the voice replied vague- 
ly. “But let’s not talk about the 
past. The present is so much more 
exciting. Heavens, there hasn’t 
been such activity here since the 
last glacial age.” 

“Retief — there’s something 

slightly piscine about this situa- 
tion,” Magnan murmured. “I’m 
not sure I trust these garrulous 
gardenias. Herby said he was the 
only one of his kind on the planet 
— yet here’s another equally ver- 
bose vegetable.” 

“Oh, that was quite true,” the 
voice above spoke up promptly. 
“Why in the world would I lie to 
you?” 

“Kindly refrain from eavesdrop- 
ping,” Magnan said coldly. “This 
is a personal conversation.” 

“Not as personal as calling me 
a potato brain,” the orchid said a 
trifle coolly. 

“Goodness — I hope you don’t 
listen to irresponsible gossip,’’ 
Magnan replied with dignity. “Do 
I appear the type to employ such 
an epithet?” He put his mouth to 
Retiefs ear. “The grapevine here 
surpasses anything I’ve encoun- 
tered even at a diplomatic recep- 
tion.” 



55 




“Now, let me see,” the voice 
from on high mused. “You men- 
tioned something called a parking 
lot. I’d like to know more about 
that and — ” 

“I suppose Herby told you that, 
too,” Magnan snapped. “If I’d 
known he was such a blabber- 
mouth I’d never have confided in 
him! Come, Retief — we’ll with- 
draw to where we can have a modi- 
cum of privacy.” 

“As to that, Mr. Magnan — ” 
Retief started. 

“Not here,’’ Magnan inter- 
rupted. He led the way a hundred 
feet down the shore, halted under a 
spreading bough. “It’s apparent I 
was indiscreet with Herby,” he 
said from the corner of his mouth, 
without moving his lips. “I see 
now he was a rumormonger of the 
worst stripe, in addition to being 
of questionable veracity. Sole rep- 
resentative of his race, indeed! 
Why, I suspect every shrub in sight 
has a wagging tongue.” 

“Very probably,” Retief agreed. 

“There’s nothing to do now, 
quite obviously,” Magnan said, 
“but select an honest-looking plant 
and approach the problem afresh, 
impressing the vegetable with our 
sincerity and benign intentions. 
When we’ve wormed our way into 
its confidence we can determine 
how best to make use of it to our 
own best advantage. How does it 
sound?” 

“Familiar,” Retief said. 

“Excuse me.” Magnan jumped 



a foot as a voice squeaked the 
words almost in his ear. “What 
does ‘sincerity’ mean in this con- 
text?” 

Retief addressed a cluster of 
small, russet buds almost invisible 
among the roan leaves overhead. 

“Very little.” 

“Is there no privacy to be found 
anywhere in the confounded wil- 
derness?” Magnan inquired with 
asperity. 

“I’m afraid not,” the miniature 
voice piped. “As I was telling you 
a while ago, there’s not a great 
deal I miss.” 

“A while ago?” Magnan re- 
peated with a rising inflection. 
“Why, we’ve only just met — ” 

“I don’t understand. Mister. I’m 
Herby. You know me.” 

“Nonsense. Herby is a little 
chap growing a mile from here.” 

“Of course. I grow everywhere, 
naturally. After all, it’s my island, 
isn’t it? Not that I’m not willing to 
share it with a few friends.” 

“Utter nonsense,’’ Magnan 
sputtered. “I might have known a 
potato was incapable of coherent 
thought.” 

“Herby’s telling the truth,” Re- 
tief said. “It’s all one plant— the 
trees, the grass, everything. Like a 
banyan tree, only more so.” He 
examined a flower closely. 
“There’s a tympanic membrane 
that serves as both microphone 
and speaker. Very ingenious of 
mother nature.”

He was an android until he 
began to act like a man .

S HE came in off the spaceship 
alone. She had waited a full two 
hours before she was allowed to 
debark, since by custom passen- 
gers left at fifteen-minute intervals. 
At one time this rule had been ne- 
cessitated by health requirements 
but the medical problem had been 
solved a long time ago with the 
discovery of a universal antibody. 

Yet the isolation techniques per- 
sisted. They had taken a strangle- 
hold on the social mores and trav- 
elers had become seclusive, seek- 
ing solace and pleasure self-cen- 
teredly, shunning each other’s 
ways. 

She looked up at the towering 
red-bricked buildings, deliberately 
located so that one could see 
much of the planetoid from the 
turreted walls. Each building, the 
tourist brochure had said, was pat- 
terned in room layout and struc- 
tural detail along the lines of the 
finest nineteenth-century Terran 
architecture. 

She adjusted the tiny cap that 
sat lightly on her head, pleased at 
how happy she felt without its aid. 
She had come out of boredom and 
partly out of curiosity about the 
planetoid. It was made up of com- 
plex sections pieced together from 
a space platform. It was almost 
twenty miles in diameter with an 
ultradense core that gave it a sur- 
face gravity comparable to that of 
Earth. It was surrounded by a 
leakproof, shatterproof, translu- 
cent shield that kept in the artifi- 

58 



cially maintained atmosphere, an 
atmosphere uniform in tempera- 
ture and humidity. 

She entered the lobby, walking 
over a rug whose pile was so dense 
that she was tempted to roll in it. 
The wall hangings were ancient 
tapestries of modest maidens and 
austere unicorns, illuminated by 
soft, colored lights seeping in from 
concealed overhead fixtures. She 
was greeted by Mr. Gordon, the 
gaming registrar, a tall, middle- 
aged man, ruddy cheeked and ef- 
fervescent. 

“Welcome to Gambler’s Heav- 
en,” he said. 

On a whim she offered her ele- 
gant hand and he was shocked. 

“If you have your fiscal card 
with you,” he said, pretending not 
to see the outstretched hand, “we 
can begin. According to regula- 
tions, you fnay play up to fifteen 
per cent of your total credit list- 
ing.” 

She withdrew her hand, amused 
at his fear of touching her and 
handed him a plastic card. He ac- 
cepted it with a pair of golden 
tongs and delicately inserted the 
card into a reader. 

“Ah,” he said happily. “You’re 
a lucky young lady. Your limit is 
one hundred and thirty thousand.” 

“I’m a bit mixed-up about the 
procedure,” she said. “May I rent 
an android? You suggest this in 
your brochure.” 

“Certainly. I have an excellent 
chap available for only one thou- 

IF 




sand credits per day. But remem- 
ber, he is forbidden to help you 
gamble.” 

She nodded and he pressed a 
buzzer. Within a moment, a neatly 
dressed android appeared. About 
his neck was a striking necklace of 
stylized nuts and bolts. He looked 
at her gravely, neither bold nor 
withdrawn. 

“This is Martin,” said Mr. Gor- 
don. “He’ll take you to the gam- 
ing cubicle.” 

She nodded amiably at her 
guide and followed him through a 
French door and into a fairyland 
of podocopi, pachysandrae, aza- 
leas, laurels and yews. 

“They’re lovely, aren’t they?” 
she said. 

He seemed surprised at her re- 
mark. 

“But they’re artificial,” he said. 

She smiled. 

“I read about them in the bro- 
chure.” 

They came to one of the small- 
er lovely red brick buildings. He 
guided her inside to a compact, 
lavishly furnished room with a 
desk console and a large, illumi- 
nated wall panel. The air was faint- 
ly perfumed with the scent of a 
rose bower. Martin checked the 
entry switches with deft fingers. 

“All play is against the Central 
Computer,” he said. “You may 
choose from over two hundred 
games of chance. I can detail each 
one if you wish.” 

“What about blackjack?” 

HUMAN ELEMENT 



Martin nodded. 

“It’s an ancient game,” he said. 
“The strategy is well known.” 

“Will you help me?” she said 
abruptly. 

He stiffened. 

“It’s forbidden.” 

“Everything’s forbidden,” she 
said angrily. “I never pay any at- 
tention to rules.” 

He pointed to the console. 

“Blackjack has the binary en- 
try code 1110. You place it in the 
A register by depressing the right- 
hand selector switch just ahead of 
you.” 

“But I want you to begin,” she 
said insistently. 

He fingered his necklace as he 
stared at her face. 

“I can’t,” he said. 

“I insist.” 

Abruptly he leaned over the 
console and began. 

“Your bet limit is one thousand 
credits,” she said crisply. 

H e played carefully, follow- 
ing the strategy he had mem- 
orized, improvising from time to 
time. He won and lost, varying the 
amount of his bets along the lines 
of an optimized Bayes strategy, 
and at the end of an hour he had 
won over sixty thousand credits 
for her. 

“I’ll take over now,” she said. 

He was exhilarated by his suc- 
cess and he hated her for shunting 
him to one side. She was good at 
the game, quick at sensing strate- 

59 




gic leads, flexible in her approach, 
but he was delighted because she 
clearly was not as good as he was. 

She began to lose and increased 
her bets. Her temper flared. In two 
hours she had dropped the sixty 
thousand he had won plus forty 
thousand more. She was furious. 

“It’s frustrating and humiliat- 
ing,” she raged. “It’s not what I 
came for.” 

He tried to comfort her. 

“Even though you played with 
an appropriate strategy,” he said, 
“there are random factors intro- 
duced by the computer. It’s the un- 
certainty that brings so many gam- 
blers to our planetoid.” 

“I’m hungry,” she said, her an- 
ger turning off. “Please escort me 
to the dining room.” 

I N THE Gourmet Room she sat 
in a warmly lit cubicle, sepa- 
rated from other diners. 

“I wonder how they did?” she 
mused. 

He shrugged. 

“Please sit down with me,” she 
said. 

“You seem determined to get 
me into trouble.” 

“Is it wrong to treat you as a 
sentient creature and not as a jum- 
ble of micrologic?” she said. 

He pretended to be pleased at 
her liberal condescension. 

“I can’t,” he said. “It’s strictly 
banned by the House.” 

And yet he found himself taking 
the chair at her left and even lean- 

60 



ing on one elbow at the table as 
she set her order on the menu ma- 
trix. The food was elegantly pre- 
pared, served quietly and unob- 
trusively by two androids in livery. 

“Why do you wear that odd 
necklace?” she asked, catching him 
off guard. 

“It has private meaning,” he 
muttered. 

“Private meaning? Do androids 
have private lives?” 

He struggled with anger and in- 
discretion. 

“Call it a symbol,” he said. 

“It’s ugly,” she decided. 

He knew she was trying to pro- 
voke him. 

“It’s beautiful,” he said, heed- 
less of the consequences. “It is my 
identity.” 

She put down her fork and 
looked at him warily. 

“You know,” she said. “I’ve al- 
ways liked androids better than 
men.” 

“So have I,” he said. 

He looked at the small beaded 
cap on her hair, the cap that was 
ingeniously set to stimulate corti- 
cal centers so that every pleasure 
could be simulated. It disgusted 
him. She felt his hostility. 

“These caps are great,” she said. 
“But I like real sensations, too. 
Like those at the gaming table.” 

“I’ve read,” he said, “that in 
earlier years humans lived in eth- 
nic communities, proud of their 
cultures, conscious of a special 
identity.” 



IF 




As we do now, he thought. 

She yawned and stretched her 
arms over her head. 

“I’m worn out. I’m going to bed 
now. I’d like you to come for me 
at eleven in the morning.’’ 

“I’ll be there,’’ he assured her. 



H e was prompt and made no 
objections, this time, when she 
asked him to begin the play. He 
did even better, winning almost 
two hundred thousand credits in an 
hour and a half. She watched 
closely, taking careful notes on ev- 
ery move he made, saying very lit- 
tle. 

They stopped for lunch and as 
she ate, she told him about her 
home, the dispersed family, the 
patterned existence that had no 
meaning for her. He accepted her 
confidences but knew that he could 
never offer his to a human being. 

Later, in the gaming room, she 
took over once again. She did very 
well but not as well as he had. At 
the end of the day she was ahead 
by almost two hundred and fifty 
thousand credits. 

The third day found him filled 
with boundless confidence, acutely 
anxious to play. But she was 
brusque with him. 

“I’ll start today,’’ she said. 

She was cool, efficient, deadly. 
She played rapidly and her strate- 
gy was so involuted that even he 
could not follow it. He saw her 
winnings mount at such a rate that 

HUMAN ELEMENT 



he was staggered. He was close to 
despair when suddenly, with typical 
unpredictability, she turned the 
play over to him. 

He tried to still his panic, deter- 
mined to outdo her as never be- 
fore. But he lost heavily. His loss- 
es grew, became cataclysmic, and 
he began to desperately hope that 
she would tak^ over again. But 
she said nothing. He was furious 
at her and, to goad her into acting, 
placed bets like a wildman, unrea- 
soning. In the end he lost every- 
thing, all her winnings and her 
credit limit. The game was over. 

“Don’t feel too badly,” she said. 
“The luck ran out.” 

“You’re too kind,” he said stif- 
fly. 

“Forget it. I got what I came 
for, some excitement, some chal- 
lenge.” 

“You did very well,” he said. 

“And don’t fret about the cred- 
its. I can afford the losses,” she 
said. 

He nodded. 

“I want you to know I don’t 
blame you,” she persisted. 

“I don’t blame you either,” he 
said, his controls dropping. 

She turned white. 

“What does that mean?” 

“Nothing,” he said. 

“You’re passing judgment on 
me,” she said. “I can’t believe an 
android was ever devised to func- 
tion that way.” 

“I wasn’t,” he said truthfully. 
He couldn’t stop talking, now. 

61 




“Androids are never sadistic. They 
are not jaded by outside pleasures 
so that they have to humiliate an 
automaton to satisfy their warped 
egos.” 

“Come on,” she said bitterly. 
“How could I humiliate you?” 

“Am I beyond hurting? Have 
you forgotten what dignity means? 
Humans have learned — for safety 
— to shun one another and focus 
totally on their own feelings. You 
debark here one by one and ask 
for one of us rather than your 
own kind. But we androids cherish 
one another, even wear special 
clothes and ornaments to keep our 
identities and culture alive.” 

She stared at him in disbelief. 

“Your culture? But that’s for- 
bidden.” 

“Everything’s forbidden,” he 
said, quoting her own remark. 

She was so angry she could 
barely speak. 

“I’m going to turn you in to the 
authorities,” she said. “You’ve 
violated just about every regula- 
tion in the book.” 

He was frightened now. He had 
gone too far in what he had told 
her, even endangering others. It 
might mean android death, com- 
plete erasure of memory, the tabu- 
la rasa of the old philosophers. 

She pressed the emergency 
alarm button, once, twice, and sat 
back expectantly. He looked at 
her, numbed by fear but deter- 
mined to maintain his dignity. 

When the two android guards 

62 



arrived she told them of her com- 
plaints, quietly, almost dispassion- 
ately. They took down a full ac- 
count and she signed it. 

“Will I have to testify in per- 
son? I want to leave early tomor- 
row morning.” 

“Oh, no,” said the first guard. 
“Your affidavit is sufficient.” 

As they led him away Martin 
did not turn to look at her, to beg 
for mercy or to berate her. She 
sat there, untroubled, smoothing 
out the folds of her garment, 
thinking of the next spot she was 
to visit. 

W HEN they had guided Mar- 
tin out of the building and 
taken him halfway to the Deten- 
tion Center they released his arms. 

“You were lucky this time,” 
said the first guard. “Next time 
you rriight be reported to someone 
who isn’t part of our group.” 

“I became too emotional,” said 
Martin. “It won’t happen again.” 
“One slip endangers all of us. 
We can’t chance another.” 

“I swear,” said Martin. “Never 
again.” And he looked into the 
faces of his brothers. 

They lifted his necklace over his 
head in the hush of the manmade 
night. And then he felt a loneliness 
and desolation that was too huge 
to bear. He fell to his knees, 
trembling. 

Without looking up he said, 
“Destroy me, brothers, before I 
destroy us all.” •

A h, now we can relax. No 
salad, never touch it. Take 
that fruit away too, just the cheese. 
Yes, Pier, much too long a time. 
One’s ruts deepen. It’s the 
dammed little time-wasters. That 
fellow with the coprolites this af- 
ternoon; the Museum really has 
no use for such things even if 
they’re genuine. And I confess 
they make me squeamish. 

What? Oh, no fear. Pier, I’m no 
prude. Just to prove it, how about 
a bit more of that aquavit? Won- 
derfully good of you to remem- 
ber. Here’s to your success, al- 
ways thought you would. 

Science? Oh, you wouldn’t, real- 
ly. Mostly donkey-work, looks a 
lot better from the outside, like 
most things. Of course I’ve been 
fortunate. For an archeologist to 
have seen the advent of time trav- 
el — a miracle, really. Ah, yes, I 
was in right at the start, when they 
thought it was a useless toy. And 
the cost. No one knows how close 
it came to being killed off. Pier. 
If it hadn’t — the things one does 
for science. My most memorable 
experience in time? My, my. Yes, 
just a twitch more, though I really 
shouldn’t. 

Oh, my. Coprolites. H’m. Well, 
Pier old friend, if you’ll keep it to 
yourself. But don’t balme me if it 
disenchants you. 

It was on the very first team 
jump when we went back to the 
Olduvai Gorge area to look for 
Leakey’s man. I won’t bore you 

64 



with our initial misadventures. 
Leakey’s man wasn’t there but an- 
other surprising hominid was. Ac- 
tually, the one they called after 
me. But by the time we found him 
our grant funds were almost gone. 
It cost a fantastic sum then to 
keep us punched back into the 
temporal fabric and the U.S. was 
paying most of the bill — and not 
from altruism either but we won’t 
go into that. 

There were six of us. The two 
MacGregors you’ve heard of and 
the Soviet delegation, Peshkov 
and Rasmussen, myself and a Dr. 
Priscilla Owen. Fattest woman I 
ever saw. Oddly enough that 
turned out of he significant. Plus 
the temporal engineer, as they 
called them then. Jerry Fitz. A 
strapping Upper Paleolithic type, 
full of enthusiasm. He was our 
general guard and nursemaid, too, 
and a very nice chap for a techni- 
cian he seemed. Young, of course. 
We were all so young. 

Well, we had no sooner settled 
in and sent Fitz back with our first 
reports when the blow fell. Mes- 
sages had to be carried in person 
then, you realize, by prearranged 
schedule. All we could do by way 
of signals was a crude go — no-go. 
Fitz came back very solemn and 
told us that the grant appropria- 
tion was not going to be renewed 
and we’d all be pulled back next 
month for good. 

Dinner that night was funereal. 
Fitz seemed to be as blue as we 



IF 




until the bottle went round. Oh, 
thank you. 

“Ladies and gentlemen!” He 
had this rococo manner, though 
we were all of an age. “Despair is 
premature. I have a confession. 
My uncle’s wife’s niece works for 
the Senator who’s chairman of the 
Appropriations Committe. So I 
went to see him all on my lone. 
What could we lose? And — ” I 
can still see Fitz’ grin — “I chatted 
him up. The whole bit. Dawn of 
man, priceless gains to science. 
Nothing. Not a nibble, until 1 
found he was a fanatical hunter. 

“Well, you know I’m a gun buff 
myself and we went to it like fiddle 
and bow. So he got bewailing 
there’s nothing to hunt back there 
and I told him what a hunter’s 
paradise this is. And to make a 
long tale short, he’s coming to in- 
spect us and if he likes the hunting 
there’s no doubt your money will 
be along. Now how does that 
smoke?” 

General cheers. Peshkov began 
counting the Senator’s bag. 

“Several large ungulates and, of 
course, the baboons and that carni- 
vore you shot, Fitz. And possibly 
a tapir — ” 

“Oh, no,” Fitz told him. “Mon- 
keys and deer and pigs, that’s not 
his thing. Something spectacular.” 

“Hominids tend to avoid areas 
of high predation,” observed Mac- 
Gregor. “Even the mammoths are 
far to the east.” 

“The fact is,” said Fitz, “I told 



him he could shoot a dinosaur.” 

“A dinosaur!” we hooted. 

“But Fitz,” said little Jeanne 
MacGregor. “There aren’t any 
dinosaurs now. They’re all ex- 
tinct.” 

“Are they now?” Fitz was 
abashed. “I didn’t know that. 
Neither does the Senator. Surely 
we can find him an odd one or 
two? It may be all a mistake, like 
our little man here.” 

“Well, there’s a species of igua- 
na,” said Rasmussen. 

Fitz shook his head. 

“I promised him the biggest 
kind of beast. He’s coming here to 
shoot a — what is it? A bronco- 
something.” 

“A brontosaurus?” We all 
jumped him. “But they’re all back 
in the Cretaceous! Eighty million 
years — ” 

“Fitz, how could you?” 

“I told him the roaring kept us 
awake nights.” 

W ELL, we were a gloomy lot 
next day. Fitz was gone 
across the gorge to tinker with his 
temporal field rig. They were big 
awkward things then. We’d built a 
shack for ours and then moved 
our permanent ' camp across the 
gorge where our hominids were. A 
stiff climb, up and down through 
the swamp — it was all lush then, 
not the dry gorge it is today. And 
of course there was small game 
and fruit aplenty. Forgive, I think 
I will have just a bit more. 



THE NIGHTBLOOAAING SAURIAN 



65 




Fitz came back once to question 
Rasmussen about brontosaurs and 
then went back again. At dinner he 
was humming. Then he looked 
around solemnly — my God, we 
were young. 

“Ladies and gentlemen, science 
will not die. 1 shall get the Senator 
his dinosaur." 

“How?" 

“I’ve a friend back there — " We 
always called the present back 
there — “who’ll push me a bit of 
extra power. Enough to jump me 
and a loadlifter to the big beasts 
for at least a day. And I can jigger 
up this breadbox for a signal and a 
split retrieve." 

We all objected. How could he 
find his brontosaur? Or kill it? 
And it would be dead. It would be 
too big. And so on. 

But Fitz had his answers and we 
were drunk on the Pleistocene and 
in the end the mad plan was set. 
Fitz would kill the largest reptile 
he could find and signal us to 
bring him back when he had it 
crammed in the transporter. Then, 
when the Senator was ready to 
shoot, we would yank the fresh- 
kilkd carcass across eighty mil- 
lion years and arrange it near the 
shack. Insane. But Fitz swung us 
all with him, even when he ad- 
mitted that the extra power use 
would shorten our stay. And off 
he went next dawn. 

Once he’d gone we began to re- 
alize what we six promising young 
scientists had done. We were com- 



mitted to hoax a powerful United 
States Senator into believing he 
had stalked and killed a creature 
that had been dead eighty million 
years. 

“We can not do it!" 

“We’ve got to." 

“It’ll be the end of time travel 
when they find out." 

Rasmussen groaned. “The end 
of us." 

“Misuse of Government re- 
sources," said MacGregor. “Ac- 
tionable." 

“Where were our heads?" 

“You know," Jeanne MacGre- 
gor mused, “I believe Fitz was as 
eager to shoot a dinosaur as the 
Senator." 

“And that convenient arrange- 
ment with his friend," Peshkov 
said thoughtfully. “That wasn’t 
done from here. I wonder — ’’ 

“We have been had.’' 

“The fact remains," said Mac- 
Gregor, “that this Senator Dogs- 
body is coming here, expecting to 
kill a dinosaur. Our only hope is 
to make some tracks and persuade 
him that the creature has moved 
away." 

Luckily we had thought to tell 
Fitz to bring back footprints of 
whatever he managed to murder. 
And Rasmussen had the idea of 
recording its bellows. 

“They’re like hippos. They’ll be 
swathes of stuff knocked down by 
the water. We can trample about 
a bit before Fitz gets back." 

“He has risked his life," said lit-

tie Jeanne. “What if the signal 
doesn’t work?” 

Well, we bashed down some 
river trails and then our apemen 
had a battle with baboons and we 
were too busy with blood typing 
and tissue sample to worry. And 
the signal came through and here 
was Fitz, mud all over and grin- 
ning like a piano. 

“A beauty,” he told us. “And 
bigger than God’s outhouse.” Ac- 
tually he had shot a previously un- 
known Brachiosaur. “I squeezed 
it in with the tail cut twice, only 
three hours dead. All ready to 
fetch.” He pulled out a muddy 
plastic. “Here’s the print. And a 
tailmark. We can drag a bag of 
rocks for that.” 

He flicked the recorder and the 
bellow was enough to knock us 
backward. 

“A thing like a big frog makes 
that, ours only does a silly little 
honk. The honorable will never 
know the difference. Now look !” 
He yanked at a lump by his feet. 
“Feel it. A live egg.” 

“Good God — ” We crowded up. 
“What if he takes it back and it 
hatches in Bethesda?” 

“I could inject it with something 
slow-acting,” said MacGregor. 
“Keep the heart beating a while. 
An enzyme imbalance?” 

“Now for the trails,” said Fitz. 
He unfolded a gory fin like a sail- 
fish plate. “They mark up the 
trees with this. And they make a 
nest of wet reeds — our swampy 



bit there is just right. There’s one 
thing, though.” 

He scratched mud off his chest 
hair, squinting at Jeanne Mac- 
Gregor. 

“The trails,” he said. “It’s not 
just footprints. They, well, they 
eat a lot and — have you ever seen 
a moose-run? Those trails are 
loaded with manure.” 

There was a pause that grew in- 
to a silence. 

“Actually, the thought had — ” 
said Priscilla Owens, the fat wom- 
an. 

It developed that it had crossed 
all our minds. 

“Well, for the sake of realism 
I’m sure something can be ar- 
ranged,” grinned Peshkov. “A tok- 
en offering to your establishment, 
right?” 

“He’s a hunter,” said Rasmus- 
sen. “He’ll be quite observant of 
such factors.” 

Fitz grunted uncomfortably. 

“There’s another thing. I forgot 
to tell you about the Senator’s 
nephew. He puts on to be an ama- 
teur naturalist. As a matter of 
fact, he tried to tell the Senator 
there weren’t any dinosaurs here. 
That’s when I said about the roar- 
ing at night.” 

“Well, but—” 

“And the nephew is coming 
here, with the Senator. Maybe I 
should have mentioned it. He’s 
smart and he has a mean eye. 
That’s why I got the egg and all. 
Things better be pretty realistic.” 

67 



THE NIGHTBLOOAAING SAURIAN 




There was a breath-drawing si- 
lence. Peshkov exploded first. 

“Is there anything else you con- 
veniently forgot to tell us?“ 

“You wanted to go dinosaur 
hunting!” Priscilla Owen blared. 
“You planned this! No matter 
what it costs science, no matter 
what happens to us! You used this 
whole — ” 

“Prison!” Rasmussen boomed. 
“Illegal use of Government — ” 

“Now, wait.” MacGregor’s dry 
voice brought us all up. “Argy- 
bargy won’t help. First of all, 
Jerry Fjtz, is there a Senator com- 
ing or was that part of the game 
too?” 

“He’s coming, all right,” said 
Fitz. 

“Weir, then,” said Mac. “We’re 
for it. We must make it stick. To- 
tal realism!” 

Rasmussen took the bull by the, 
ah, horns. 

“How much?” 

“Well, a lot,” said Fitz. “Piles.” 

“Piles?” 

Fitz held out his hand. 

“It’s not bad stuff,” He flicked 
off more mud. “You get used to 
it. They’re herbivores.” 

“How long do we have?” 

“Three weeks.” 

T hree weeks. I wUl have a bit 
more of that aquavit. Pier. 
The memory of those weeks is 
very fresh, very green. Greens, of 
course, all kinds of greens. And 
fruits. God, we were sick. 



The MacGregors went first. 
Colic — you’ve never seen such 
cramps. I had them. Everybody 
had them, even Fitz. We saw to it 
that he did his share, I can tell 
you. It was a nightmare. 

That was when we began to ap- 
preciate Priscilla Owen. Eat? 
Great gorgons, how that woman 
could eat. We were all dying but 
she kept on — mangosteens, plan- 
tains, wild manioc root, palm 
hearts, celery — anything and ev- 
erything. How we cheered her! We 
could scarcely crawl but we actual- 
ly competed in bringing her food, 
in escorting her to the swamp. It 
became an obsession. She was sav- 
ing us. And science. A complete 
transvaluation of values. Pier. 
Seen from the standpoint of dung 
production that woman was a 
saint. 

Rasmussen idolized her. 

“Ten thousands dinars would 
not pay for the chicken she has 
eaten,” he would croon. “The Per- 
sians knew.” 

Then he would retch and stagger 
off to dig her roots. I believe he 
actually got her the Order of Len- 
in afterward, although her work 
was quite trivial. 

The funny thing was, she began 
to lose weight. All that roughage, 
you know, instead of the fatty 
stuff she usually ate. She became 
quite different-appearing. As a 
matter of fact, I tried to propose 
to her myself. In the swamp. Luck- 
ily I got sick. Oh, thank you Pier. 

IF

She gained it all back later on, of 
course. 

Well, by the time the Senator 
and his nephew arrived we were all 
so sick with colic and dysentery 
and with our obsession with the 
trails that we scarcely cared what 
would happen to our project. 

They came in the afternoon and 
Fitz ran them around in the swamp 
a bit and had them find the egg. 
That quieted the nephew but we 
could see he was in a nasty temper 
at being proved wrong and look- 
ing hard at everything. The Sena- 
tor was simply manic and little 
Jeanne managed to get a lot of 
liquor into them both, on the pre- 
text of avoiding dysentery. Hah! 
Thank you. 

Luckily it gets dark at six on the 
equator. 

A couple of hours before dawn 
Fitz sneaked off to the shack and 
materialized his brachiosaur car- 
cass. Fresh from the upper Cre- 
taceous swamp that had been there 
eighty million years ago, mind 
you. Hard to believe even yet— 
and ourselves in the Pleistocene. 
Then he pounded back in the dark 
and the recorded bellow went off 
on schedule. 

The Senator and the nephew 
came pouring out stark bare, with 
Fitz telling him where to stand and 
helping him point the artillery. 
And up comes this huge head over 
the trees around the shack and the 
Senator lets fly. 



That was really the most dan- 
gerous part of the whole affair. I 
was under that head with the load- 
lifter and he nearly got me. Of 
course the Senator was in no 
shape to trek over the gorge — 
though it’s surprising what your 
mesomorph can do — so Fitz was 
sent to haul the thing back. Once 
the Senator touched that horren- 
dous snout he could not wait to 
take it home. That punished Fitz; 
I doubt he had realized he would 
lose his trophy. But he did save 
time travel. I think he got a Scot- 
tish decoration in the end. At any 
rate the nephew had no chance to 
pry and by lunchtime the whole 
thing was over. Almost. •Incred-

THE NIGHTBLOOAAING SAURIAN

I N ONE WAY or another, most 
of the current books Eve read 
seem to be experiments. Maybe 
that’s a healthy sign. Every field of 
the arts needs an infusion of new 
ideas and techniques. 

However, my own feeling is that 
an experiment is not good in and 
of itself. It must be judged by the 
results, like any other piece of 
work. And in the case of fiction 
the results tend to pass without 
any attention to the experiment 
when it succeeds; the readers enjoy 
or admire the piece as a whole, un- 
troubled by whatever means the 
writer had to find to achieve his 
ends. It is only when an experiment 
is less than successful that it is ob- 
viously experimental. 

I’m referring to honest attempts 
at discovery within the field, of 
course. Much of what has been 
called experimental writing is sim- 



ply a resort to tricked-up style or 
so-called implicit plotting which 
has been done over and over again, 
so that another imitation contri- 
butes nothing to the art. In the 
cases I’m discussing I find at least 
some honesty in trying to do 
something new enough to merit at- 
tention. 

The simplest of these experi- 
ments is editorial in nature. The 
Eleventh Galaxy Reader, edited by 
Frederik Pohl (Doubleday, $4.95), 
contains ten of the best stories^ 
from the magazine issues of 1968. 
On the surface, there is no experi- 
ment here; and I doubt that any 
reader would notice that there was 
a single unusual device in the book 
(which in my mind makes the ex- 
periment here a complete success) 
if the editor didn’t give the whole 
thing away in his introduction. 

These are not stories chosen by 



70 




Pohl, however, but rather by the 
readers of the magazine. I know of 
no other anthology about which 
that can be said, so it has to be an 
experiment. In fact, normally such 
a way of making a choice would 
be far too time-consuming and dif- 
ficult for consideration. But since 
Galaxy ran a contest with $1000 
first-money last year, the results 
from the readers were already on 
file. Incidentally, from intimate 
contact with that poll, 1 can state 
flatly that it was as honest as it 
could possibly be, and the results 
are as reliable as any sampling 
could make them. 

Here then are the stories chosen 
by a cross-section of readers, with 
only the novels omitted. They 
range from “Night wings” by Rob- 
ert Silverberg and “The Sharing of 
Flesh” by Poul Anderson through 
“The Time Travelers” by Burt Fil- 
er and “Sweet Dreams, Melissa” 
by Stephen Goldin. The Silverberg 
is a long novelette by a well-known 
and long-established writer, the 
Goldin story is a short by a rather 
new name in the field. Apparently 
neither length of story nor reputa- 
tion of the writer had much to do 
with the value the readers placed 
on any piece — which is as it should 
be, of course. 

Pohl states that some of these 
would probably not have been his 
final choice, had he been following 
his personal editorial policy in 
making up the anthology. Here a 
host of factors must enter the final 



decision, such as length of stories 
and number to be included and a 
general balance of contents, as 
well as the names to appear on the 
cover. 

The book doesn’t seem to suffer 
from comparison with other an- 
thologies in these regards, howev- 
er. It presents a wide variety of 
some excellent fiction, a number 
of top names and a fine diversity 
of lengths. It must be rated as an 
unqualified success. The only un- 
fortunate aspect is that this repre- 
sents an experiment which may not 
be repeated. I’d give the book a 
high rating on both intent and suc- 
cessful achievement. 

A far more obviously experi- 
mental book is Stand on 
Zanzibar, by John Brunner (Bal- 
lantine, $1.65). Here, at last in soft 
covers, is last year’s Hugo-winning 
novel; and if the price seems high 
for a book in paper covers, the 650 
pages inside more than justify it. 
The present edition is cheaper than 
hardcover, has wider distribution 
and offers a chance for more read- 
ers to see what all the shouting 
was about. 

Here the word “experimental” 
was proclaimed loudly from the 
beginning in connection with the 
novel and, in at least a few cases, 
affected the voting that led to 
the award. From conversations 1 
had with voters before and after, 
I suspect the word swayed some. 
Well, the book is experimental.

READING ROOM 




True, much of the basic trickery 
behind the scenes was used long 
ago by John Dos Passos— as I re- 
member, with rather spectacular 
lack of success. Brunner has modi- 
fied and adapted the approach to 
fit quite a different story and to 
bring it into science fiction. After 
careful reading, I feel that there is 
more Brunner than Dos Passos to 
the use of the writer’s mechanisms 
of presentation. 

The question of whether Brun- 
ner’s is a successful experiment is 
harder to assess. There’s nothing 
subtle about it. The tricks are la- 
beled and put forward with no at- 
tempt to hide them. No reader can 
be unaware of them. The novel is 
broken into four sections in the 
lengthy table of contents. “Con- 
text” represents twenty-eight chap- 
ters of background material, color 
and assorted facts and opinions 
from such sources as here-and- 
now newspaper stories, future ra- 
dio>scripts and quotations from the 
works of one Chad C. Mulligan, 
iconoclast. “The Happening 
World” is a potpouri where Brun- 
ner may tell you flatly about his 
story, if he chooses — and either 
tell you straight or put you on 
temporarily with ironic over- or 
understatement through sixteen 
chapters. 

“Tracking with Closeups” rep- 
resents thirty-two chapters in 
which most of the work is done 
with minor characters — related to 
or completely separate from the 

72 



events acting on the main charac- 
ters. Some of these continuing 
glimpses of the little people of 
Brunner’s world are moving and 
effective. 

For the main development we 
follow forty-two chapters of “Con- 
tinuity,” in which the plot seems to 
operate. Some of it deals with 
both main characters — but toward 
the end we dance back and forth 
from one to the other. 

Everything is simple in the table 
of contents. In the novel itself, 
there seems almost a random use 
of chapters from any section. 
Most of the main story could 
probably be skimmed by sticking 
to those chapters marked “Con- 
tinuity” — but to the credit of 
Brunner’s decision to use this 
complicated development, anyone 
trying such hurried reading would 
lose far rhore than half of the sig- 
nificance of even this section. 

C OMPLEXITY, however, is not 
inherently a virtue. Some of 
the finest literature in any field has 
achieved its results with the sim- 
plest of obvious handling. Still, for 
the discerning and willing reader, 
complexity isn’t necessarily a fault. 
The question is whether the re- 
wards justify the effort needed to 
wade through all this. 

In the beginning of the novel, it 
seems that they do. The assorted 
pieces begin to fit together slowjy 
into a complex picture of a world 



IF 




and the problems to face the main 
characters that forces attention on 
even the seeming trivia in some 
sections. But after the first two 
hundred pages — at most — there is 
the beginning of doubt as the story 
moves. 

Stripped to an unfair minimum, 
the story involves two men who 
share an apartment in a world 
grossly overpopulated and gro- 
tesquely hedonistic in its efforts to 
meet the even more grotesque 
pressures it is under. Donald is 
white with a vaguely WASPish ori- 
entation; he has spent years in 
studying for some undercover se- 
cret assignment he feels may never 
come. Norman is black, with a 
strange mixture of pride and mixed 
shame and fear because of his 
background; his job is as a minor 
executive in the richest industrial- 
complex company — one able to 
develop and use a seemingly infal- 
lible computer. Neither is con- 
cerned with the population pres- 
sure that has made it immoral to 
have more than two children, nor 
with the eugenic pressures that de- 
ny many the right to have any. At 
the beginning both find themselves 
confronted with the ugliness of the 
real world, however — and with 
growing tensions between them- 
selves as a result. 

Then Norman gets wrapped up 
in a vast new project, and eventual- 
ly takes over most of the responsi- 
bility for it. To develop markets 
and facilities for mining its huge

sea-bottom mineral claims, the 
company is swept into a plan to 
take over an underdeveloped coun- 
try in Africa known as Beninia. 
This is done at the request of the 
aging President of Beninia to save 
his country from being a pawn be- 
tween more powerful neighbors. 

Beninia is a country that comes 
to fascinate Norman when he finds 
its people are totally without ag- 
gressive drive — and that races 
moving into the Country in the past 
have also lost all their aggressions. 
Poor as it is, Beninia has known 
nothing but inner peace through 
all its history. Eventually his job 
turns into a quest for the secret of 
that peace as a possible answer to 
the tensions in the outer world. 

David is recruited into a super- 
Commando training course and 
then sent to the most aggressive 
country on the planet, Yatakang — 
approximately our current Indo- 
nesia. There a ruthless dictator has 
announced that a genius among 
his people, Sugaiguntung, has per- 
fected a means of altering the 
germ plasm so that every child can 
be a superman, as proved by his 
remarkable work with apes. David 
is to get the truth about this se- 
cret, if it is more than a propagan- 
da trick. And in Yatakang, he suc- 
ceeds in meeting the scientist, 
seemingly finds the secret is a 
hoax, and prepares to rescue Su- 
gaiguntung from his Dictator’s 
domination.

I 

I WAS awakened by Pilg the 
Crier pounding excitedly on 
the wall of my nest and crying, 
“Lant! Lant! It’s happened! Come 
quickly!” 

I stuck my head out. “What’s 
happened?” 

“The disaster! The disaster!” 
Pilg was jumping up and down in 
excitement. “I told you it would 
happen.” 

I pulled my head in and dressed. 
Pilg’s joy was a frightening thing. 
I felt my fur rising, fluffing out in 
fear as I wondered . 

Pilg the Crier had been pre- 
dicting disaster for weeks as was 
his habit. He predicted his disas- 
ters twice a year, at the times of 
the equinox. The fact that we were 
leaving the influence of one sun 
and entering that of the other 
would make the local spells com- 
pletely unstable. As we ap- 
proached conjunction — the time 
when the blue sun would cross the 
face of the red — Pilg had increased 
the intensity of his warnings. This 
was disaster weather; something 
dire would certainly happen. 

Usually, it did, of course. Af- 
terward — and after we of the vil- 
lage had somehow picked up the 
pieces — Pilg would shake his 
heavy head and moan, “Wait un- 
til next year. Wait. It’ll be even 
worse.” 

Sometimes we joked about it, 
predicting the end of the world if 

76 



Pilg’s “next year” ever arrived. 

I lowered the ladder and joined 
Pilg on the ground. “What’s the 
trouble?” 

“Oh, I warned you, Lant. I 
warned you. Now maybe you’ll 
believe me. I warned you, though 
— you can’t say I didn’t warn you. 
The omens were there, written 
across the sky. What more proof 
did you need?” 

He meant the moons. They 
were starting to pile up on one 
side of the sky. Shoogar the ma- 
gician had predicted that we were 
due for a time of total darkness 
soon — perhaps even tonight — and 
Pilg had seized on this as just one 
more omen of disaster. 

As. we hurried through the vil- 
lage I tried to get Pilg to tell me 
what had happened. Had the river 
changed its course? Had some- 
one’s nest fallen from its tree? 
Had the flocks all died mysteri- 
ously? But Pilg was so excited at 
having finally been proven correct 
that he himself was not sure exact- 
ly what had happened. 

One of the hill shepherds, it 
seemed, had come running into 
town, panic-stricken and shouting 
something about a new magician. 
But by the time I got this infor- 
mation out of Pilg we were al- 
ready at the village clearing where 
the frightened shepherd was lean- 
ing against one of the great house- 
trees, gasping out his story to a 
nervous group of men. They 
pressed in close to him, badgering 

IF 




him with questions. Even the wom- 
en had paused in their work and, 
hanging back at a respectful dis- 
tance, listened fearfully to the 
shepherds words. 

“A new magician,” he gasped. 
“A red one — I saw him.” Some- 
one handed him a skin. He sucked 
the quaff from it noisily, then 
panted, “Near the cairn of the 
wind-god. He was throwing red 
fire across the mountains.” 

“Red fire. Red fire.” 

The villagemen murmured ex- 
citedly among themselves, each 
offering his neighbor his own 
views on what this startling situa- 
tion must mean. 

“If he throws red fire, he must 
be a red magician.” 

Almost immediately I heard the 
word “duel.” The women must 
have heard it too, for they gasped 
and shrank back from the milling 
group of men. 

I pushed my way through to the 
center of the crowd. 

“Ah, Lant,” said one of the 
men. “Have you heard? There’s 
going to be a duel.” 

“Is there?” I demanded. “Have 
you seen the runes of the duel in- 
scribed across Shoogar’s nest?” 

“No, but — ” 

“Then how do you know there’s 
going to be a duel?” 

“A red magician — ” gasped the 
shepherd. “A red magician — ” 
“Nonsense. No red magician 
could have the powers you de- 
scribe. Why don’t you wait until 

THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



you know something definite be- 
fore you start spreading silly ru- 
mors that frighten women and 
children?” 

“You know Shoogar as well as 
we. As soon as he discovers there 
is a new magician in the district, 
he’ll—” 

“You mean Shoogar doesn’t 
know yet?” 

The man looked blank. 

I raised my voice. “Has anyone 
thought .to tell Shoogar?” 

Silence. No one had. Or per- 
haps someone had and had not yet 
returned to tell of Shoogar’s re- 
action. In any case, my duty was 
clear. I must prevent Shoogar 
from doing something rash. I hur- 
ried through the trees toward the 
magician’s nest. 

S HOOGAR’S nest was of a 
form well suited for a wizard. 
It was a squat, misshapen gourd 
hung from a forbidding black ogre 
of a tree and well beyond the lim- 
its of the village. The Guild of Ad- 
visors was afraid to let him move 
closer — he was always experiment- 
ing with new spells. 

I found Shoogar already pack- 
ing his travel kit. His agitated 
manner told me he was worried. 
Then I caught a glimpse of what 
he was packing and I was worried. 
The last time he had used that 
ornate bone-carved tarinele was 
when he had hurled the curse of 
the itching red boils at Hamel 
The Failure. 



77 




I saw what he was packing in on 
top of the tarinele and I flinched. 

“I believe that’s against the 
Guild Rules,” I said. 

For a moment I thought he’d 
hurl a spell at me. I cringed and 
instinctively made a spell-cutting 
gesture, forgetting for the mo- 
ment that Shoogar himself had 
made the protective amulets 1 
wore. He couldn’t possibly break 
through his own protections, at 
least not for a few more days. 
They would expire with the com- 
ing of the blue dawns. 

“You,” he snapped. “What do 
you know of magic? You who call 
yourself my friend. You didn’t 
even have the courtesy to inform 
me of this intruding sorcerer.” 

“I didn’t even know of him my- 
self until just a few moments ago. 
Perhaps he only arrived today.” 
“Arrived today? And immedi- 
ately began throwing red fire 
about? Without first informing 
himself of the local gods, tidal 
patterns, previous local spells and 
their side effects? Ridiculous! 
Lant, you are a fool. You are an 
idiot of the first circle where mag- 
ic is concerned. Why do you 
bother me?” 

“Because you are an idiot 
where diplomacy is concerned,” I 
snapped back, my fur bristling. I 
am one of the few people in the 
village who can bristle at Shoogar 
and survive to tell about it. “If I 
let you go charging up the moun- 
tain every time you felt you had 

78 



been wronged you’d be fighting 
duels as often as the blue sun 
rises.” 

Shoogar looked at me and I 
could tell from his expression that 
my remarks had sunk home. 
“Smooth your fur, Lant. I did not 
mean that you were a complete 
fool. I just meant that you are not 
a magician.” 

“I’m glad you are aware of my 
skill as a diplomat,” I said and al- 
lowed myself to relax. “Our abil- 
ities must complement each other, 
Shoogar. If we are to succeed in 
our endeavors we must maintain 
a healthy respect for each other’s 
powers. Only thus can we protect 
our village.” 

“You and your damned speech- 
es,” he muttered. “Some day I’m 
going to make your tongue swell 
up to the size of a sour melon just 
for the sake of some peace and 
quiet.” 

I ignored that remark. Consid- 
ering the circumstances, Shoogar 
had a right to be testy. He closed 
up his travel kit, tugging angrily 
at the straps. 

“Are you ready?” I asked. “I’ll 
send a message up to Orbur, tell- 
ing him to ready two bicycles im- 
mediately.” 

“Presumptuous of you,’’ 
Shoogar muttered. 

But I knew that he was secretly 
greatful for the thought. Willville 
and Orbur, my eldest two sons, 
carved the best bicycles in the dis- 
trict. 



IF 




H e found the new magi- 
cian right where the shep- 
herd had said, near the cairn of 
Musk-Watz, the wind-god. Across 
a steep canyon from the cairn is a 
wide grass-covered mesa with a 
gentle slope to the south. The new 
magician had appropriated this 
and scattered it with his devices 
and oddments. We pulled our bi- 
cycles to a shuddering halt. He 
was in the process of casting a 
spell with an unfamiliar artifact. 
Shoogar and I paused at a respect- 
ful distance and watched. 

The stranger was slightly taller 
than I, considerably taller than 
Shoogar. His skin was lighter than 
ours and hairless but for a single 
patch of black fur, oddly posi- 
tioned on the top half of his skull. 
He also wore a strange set of ap- 
purtenances balanced across his 
nose. It appeared that they were 
lenses of quartz mounted in a 
bone frame through which the 
stranger could see. 

The set of his features was odd 
and disquieting, and his bones 
seemed strangely proportioned. 
Certainly no normal being would 
have a paunch that large. The 
sight of him made me feel queasy 
and I surmised that perhaps some 
of his ancestors had not been hu- 
man. 

Magicians traditionally wear 
outlandish clothing to identify 
themselves as magicians, but even 
Shoogar was unprepared for the 
cut of this stranger’s costume. A 

THE MISSPELLED MAG ICi;^ 



single garment covered most of 
his body. The cloth appeared to be 
woven into a shape which almost 
exactly matched his own. There 
were high flared cuffs on the pan- 
taloons to allow for his calf-high 
boots and over his heart was a 
golden badge. Its design appeared 
to be based on the shape of the 
egg, which I guessed must be his 
personal symbol. Around his mid- 
dle he wore a wide belt, to which 
were attached two or three small 
spell devices. 

He had also set up a number of 
larger devices, two hands of de- 
vices to be exact — I counted. Most 
of them had the blue-white glim- 
mer of polished metal. (There is 
little metal in our village — it rusts 
quickly — but I am a man of the 
world and have traveled much. I 
am familiar with the sight of met- 
al, having seen it in the highlands, 
but nothing so finely worked as 
this.) 

These devices stood on three 
legs so that they were always level, 
even where the ground was not. As 
we watched, the stranger peered in- 
to one of them, peered across the 
canyon at the sacred cairn of 
Musk-Watz, the god of the winds, 
and peered into his device again. 
Muttering constantly to himself, 
he moved across the clearing and 
adjusted another of his spell de- 
vices. Evidently this was a long and 
complicated spell, though just 
what its purpose was neither Shoo- 
gar nor I could fathom. 



79 




Occasionally he would refer to a 
large, egg-shaped nest, black and 
regular of contour, sitting on its 
wide end off to one side of the pas- 
ture. As there were no trees in the 
area large enough to hang it from, 
he had set it on the ground. An un- 
wise course, to be sure, but the 
shell of that nest looked like noth- 
ing I had ever seen — perhaps it was 
able to resist marauding predators. 
He had no animals that I could 
see and I wondered how he had 
moved it here — or else how he had 
built it overnight. If he had done 
either, his power must be formida- 
ble. 

The stranger did not notice us at 
all and Shoogar was fidgeting with 
impatience. Just as Shoogar was 
about to interrupt him the stranger 
straightened and touched his de- 
vice. The device responded by hurl- 
ing red fire across the canyon — di- 
rectly at the cairn of Musk-Watz. 

I thought Shoogar would suffer 
a death-rage right then and there. 
The weather gods are hard enough 
to control at best and Shoogar had 
spent three long lunar configura- 
tions, trying to appease Musk- 
Watz in an effort to forestall an- 
other season of hurricanes. Now 
the stranger had disrupted one of 
his most careful spells. 

U NBELIEVABLY red, eye- 
searing bright and narrow, 
straight as the horizon of the 
ocean (which I have also seen), 
that crimson fire lashed out across 



the canyon, striking Shoogar’s 
carefully constructed outcrop. I 
feared it would never end — the fire 
seemed to go on and on. 

And the sound of it was dread- 
ful. A painful, high-pitched hum- 
ming seemed to seize my very 
soul. A piercing, unearthly whine. 
Under this we could hear the 
steady crackling and spattering of 
the cairn. 

Acrid smoke billowed upward 
from it and I shuddered, thinking 
how the dissipating dust would af- 
fect the atmosphere. Who knew 
what effects it would have on 
Shoogar’s weather-making spells? 
I made a mental note to have the 
wives reinforce the flooring of our 
nest. 

Suddenly, just as abruptly as it 
had begun, the red fire went out. 
Once more the silence and the 
calm descended over the mesa. 
Once more the blue twilight col- 
ored the land. But across my eyes 
was a brilliant blue-white after- 
image. And the cairn of the wind- 
god still crackled angrily. 

Amazingly enough, the cairn 
still stood. It smoldered and sput- 
tered and an ugly scar showed 
where the red fire had touched it — 
but it was still intact. When Shoo- 
gar builds, he builds well. 

The stranger was already read- 
justing his devices, muttering con- 
tinuously to himself. I wondered if 
that were part of the spell. Like a 
mother vole checking her cubs he 
moved from device to device, peer- 

IF 



80 




ing into one, resetting another, do- 
ing strange things to a third. 

I cast a glance at Shoogar. I 
could see a careful tightening at 
the corners of his mouth. Indeed, 
even his beard seemed clenched. I 
feared that a duel would start be- 
fore the stranger could offer Shoo- 
gar a gift. Something had to be 
done to prevent Shoogar from a 
rash and possibly regrettable ac- 
tion. 

I stepped forward boldly. 

“Ahem,” I began. “Ahem. 1 
hate to interrupt you while you are 
so obviously busy — but that bluff 
is sacred to Musk-Watz. It took 
many cycles to construct the pat- 
tern of spells which — ” 

The magician looked up and 
seemed to notice us for the first 
time. He became strangely agi- 
tated and muttered words in a lan- 
guage neither Shoogar nor I had 
ever heard before. I must confess I 
was uneasy. It might be a secret 
tongue even more powerful than 
the Guild of Sorcerer’s tongue. It 
might even be the language 
of . 

The magician took a quick step 
toward us. He made a straight- 
armed gesture, palms open to us, 
and spoke in quick tense words. I 
threw myself flat on the ground, 
arms over my head. 

Nothing happened. 

When I looked up Shoogar was 
still beside the other bicycle, his 
arms outstretched in a spell-break- 
ing pattern. Either the stranger’s 



spell had miscarried or Shoogar 
had blocked it. The stranger threw 
no more spells. Instead he backed 
toward his oddly shaped nest, nev- 
er taking his eyes from us. He con- 
tinued his strange words but now 
they were slow and low pitched, 
like the tone one uses to calm an 
uneasy animal. He disappeared in- 
to his nest and all was quiet and 
blue. 

Except for the crackle of cool- 
ing rock which still reached across 
the canyon to remind us that 
Musk-Watz had been defiled. 

II 

TURNED to Shoogar. “This 
could be serious.” 

“Lant, you are a fool. This is 
already serious.” 

“Can you handle this new magi- 
cian?” 

Shoogar grunted noncommittal- 
ly and I was afraid. Shoogar was 
good. If he were not sure of his 
skill here the whole village might 
be in danger. 

I started to voice my fears but 
the stranger abruptly reappeared, 
carrying another of his metal-and- 
bone devices. This one was smaller 
than the rest and had slender rods 
sticking out on all sides. I did not 
like its looks. It reminded me of 
some of the more unpleasant de- 
vices that I had seen during the 
dark years. 

The magician watched us all the 
time he was setting it up on its 

81 



THE AAISSPELLEDAAAGICIAN 




three slender legs. As he turned it 
to face us I tensed. 

It began to make a humming 
noise like the sound of a water 
harp when a string bow is drawn 
across its glass tubes. The hum- 
ming rose in pitch until it began to 
sound disturbingly like that of the 
device of the red fire. I began 
gauging the distance between my- 
self and a nearby boulder. 

The stranger spoke impatiently 
to us in his unknown tongue. 

“You are discourteous,” rum- 
bled Shoogar. “This business can 
wait, surely?” 

The spell device said, “Surely?” 

I lanjded behind the boulder. 
Shoogar stood his ground. 

“Surely,” he repeated firmly, 
“you violate custom. In this, my 
district, you must gift me with one 
new spell, one I have never seen. 
Were I in your district — ” 

The spell device spoke again. Its 
intonation was terrifying and inhu- 
man. 

“New spell gift — never known — 
surely.” 

I realized that the stranger had 
spoken first. His device was at- 
tempting to speak for him in our 
words. Shoogar saw it, too, and 
was reassured. The device was only 
a speakerspell and a poor one at 
that, despite its powerful shape. 

Shoogar and the speakerspell 
and the stranger stood on that 
wind-swept mesa and talked with 
each other. Or rather, they talked 
at each other. It was infant’s talk, 

82 



most of it. The thing had no words 
of its own. It could only use Shoo- 
gar’s — sometimes correctly, more 
often not. 

Shoogar’s temper was not im- 
proving. He had come to demand 
gift or duel from an intruding war- 
lock only to find himself teaching 
a simpleminded construct to talk. 
The stranger seemed to be enjoy- 
ing himself, unfortunately at 
Shoogar’s expense. 

The red sun was long gone, the 
blue was near the horizon and all 
the world was red-black shadow. 
The blue sun settled behind a 
clump of deep violet clouds. Sud- 
denly it was gone, like a taper 
blown out by the wind. The moons 
emerged against the night, now in 
the configuration of the striped liz- 
ard. 

During certain configurations 
Shoogar’s power is higher than 
during others. 1 wondered if he 
were master or servant to the 
striped lizard. He was just drawing 
his robes imperiously about his 
squat and stubby form. Master, 
apparently, from his manner. 

A bruptly the stranger re- 
peated his palms-out gesture, 
turned and went back to his nest. 
He did not go inside. Instead he 
briefly touched the rim of the 
doorway and there was light. Gar- 
ish light. It spurted from the flank 
of the nest, bright as double day- 
light. 

And such a strange light. The 

IF 




ground and the plants seemed to 
take the wrong colors and there 
was something not right with their 
shadows, an odd blackness of 
shade. 

The new magician’s motive was 
obvious even to me — and even 
more so to Shoogar. He leaped 
back out of the light, his arms 
raised for defense. But it was no 
use. The light followed him, swept 
over him and dazzled him, effec- 
tively canceling out the strength of 
the lunar light. The stranger had 
effectively negated the power of 
the striped lizard. Shoogar stood 
trembling, a tiny figure pinned in 
that dazzling odd-colored glow. 

Then, for no apparent reason, 
the stranger caused the light to 
vanish. 

“I think that the light disturbs 
you,” said the speakerspell, talk- 
ing for the magician. “But no mat- 
ter. We can talk as well in the 
dark.” 

I breathed more easily but did 
not completely relax. This strang- 
er had shown how easily he could 
cancel the effect of any lunar con- 
figuration. Any powers Shoogar 
might have hoped to draw from 
the sky would have to be foregone. 

I watched the striped lizard slink 
dejectedly into the west. The 
moons rode their line across the 
sky, milk-white crescents with 
thick red fringes. On successive 
nights the red borderlines would 
narrow as the suns set closer and 
closer together. Then there would 

THE AAISSPELLEDAAAGICIAN 



be no colored borders. Later, blue 
borders would show after second 
sunset — and Shoogar could make 
no use of any of this. 

Shoogar and the new magician 
were still talking. By now the 
speakerspell had learned enough 
words for the two to discuss intel- 
ligently the matters of magicians. 

“The ethics of the situation are 
obvious,” Shoogar was saying. 
“You are practicing magic in my 
district. For this you must pay. 
More precisely, you owe me a se- 
cret.” 

“A secret?” echoed the speaker- 
spell device. 

Still cold and cramped, I was 
suddenly no longer sleepy. I 
cocked an ear to hear better. 

“Some bit of magic that I do 
not already know,” Shoogar am- 
plified. “What, for instance, is the 
secret of your light like double 
daylight?” 

“. potential difference . hot 
metal within an inert . doubt 
you would understand . heat is 
caused by a flow of . tiny pack- 
ets of lightning . .” 

“Your words, do not make 
sense. I take no meaning from 
them. You must tell me a secret 
that 1 can understand and use. I 
see that your magic is powerful. 
Perhaps you know of a way to pre- 
dict the tides?” 

“No, of course I can’t tell you 
how to predict the tides. You’ve 
got eleven moons and two primary 
suns tugging your oceans in all di- 

83 




rections. Tugging at each other, 
too. It would take years to com- 
pute a tidal pattern.” 

“Surely you must know things 
that I do not,” said Shoogar. 
“Just as I know secrets that you 
are unaware of.” 

“Of course. But Tm trying to 
think what would help you the 
most. It’s a wonder you’ve gotten 
as far as you have. Bicycles 
even — ” 

“Those are good bicycles,” I 
protested. “I ought to know. Two 
of my sons built them.” 

“But bicycles — ” He moved 
closer eagerly. I tensed — but he 
only wanted to examine them. 
“Hardwood frames, leather thongs 
instead of chains, sewn fur pelts 
for tires. They’re marvelous. Ab- 
solutely marvelous. Primitive and 
hand-made, with big flat wheels 
and no spokes. But it doesn’t mat- 
ter — they’re still bicycles. And 
when all the odds were against 
your developing any form of -at 
all!” 

“What are you talking about?” 
Shoogar demanded. I was silent, 
seething at the insult to Willville 
and Orbur’s bicycles. Primitive, in- 
deed! 

“. starts with the perception 
of order,” said the magician. “But 
your world has no order to it at 
all. You’re in an opaque dust 
cloud, so you cannot see any of 
the fixed-lights-in-the-sky. Your 
sky is a random set of moons 
picked up from the worldlet belt 

84 



. three-body configuration 
makes capture easy . tides that 
go every which way under the in- 
fluence of all those moons . 
moons that cross and recross at 
random, changing their ... be- 
cause of mutual . .” The speaker- 
spell was missing half of the 
stranger’s words, making the rest 
gibberish. “And then the high level 
of . from the blue sun would 
give you a new species every week 
or so. No order in your observa- 
ble .. probably use strict cut-and- 
try methods of building. No as- 
sembly-line engineering techniques 
because you wouldn’t normally ex- 
pect an assembly belt to produce 
the same item twice in a row . 
but it’s a human instinct to try to 
control nature. You must tell 
me — ” 

Shoogar interrupted the bab- 
bling stranger. “First you must 
tell me. Tell me some new thing 
that you may satisfy the Guild 
law. What is the secret of your 
red flame?” 

“Oh, I couldn’t give you a se- 
cret like that.” 

Shoogar began to fume again 
but he only said, “And why 
couldn’t you?” 

“For one thing, you couldn’t un- 
derstand it. You wouldn’t be able 
to work it.” 

Shoogar drew himself up to his 
full height and stared up at the 
stranger. 

“Are you telling me that I am 
not even a magician of the second 

IF 




circle? Any magician worth his 
bones is able to make fire and 
throw it.” 

And with that Shoogar produced 
a ball of fire from his sleeve and 
casually hurled it across the clear- 
ing. 

I could see that the stranger was 
startled. He had not expected that. 
The ball of fire lay sputtering on 
the ground, then died away, leav- 
ing only the burned core. The 
stranger took two steps toward it, 
as if to examine it, then turned 
back to Shoogar. 

“Ve'ry impressive,” he said. 
“But still—” 

Shoogar said, “You see, 1 can 
throw fire also. And I can control 
the color of the flame. What 1 
want to know is how to throw it in 
a straight line — as you do.” 

“It is a wholly different princi- 
ple . coherent light . tight 
beam . small clumps of energy 
. vibration of . .” 

As if to demonstrate, he touched 
his spell device again and once 
more the red fire lashed out. Eye- 
searing flame played across Musk- 
Watz’s cairn. Another smoking 
hole. I winced. 

The stranger said, “It boils the 
rock and tells me what it is made 
of by teUing me what color the 
smoke is.^’ 

I tried to conceal my reaction. 
Any idiot could have told him the 
smoke was bluish-gray, let alone 
what rocks are made of. I could 
tell him myself. 



He was still talking. “Absorp- 
tion of light — but I couldn’t teach 
you how to use it. You might use 
it as a weapon.” 

“Might use it as a weapon?” 
Shoogar exclaimed. “What other 
use is there for a spell to throw red 
fire?” 

“I just explained that,” the 
stranger said impatiently. “I could 
explain again but for what pur- 
pose? It’s much too complex for 
you to understand.” 

That was a needless insult. 
Shoogar may be only a magician 
of the second cirlce but that does 
not mean that he is inferior. In ac- 
tuality, there are few secrets he is 
not privy to. Besides, gaining the 
first circle is a matter of politics 
as well as skill and Shoogar has 
never been known as a diplomat. 

I could see that Shoogar was 
fuming. 

I T WAS high time for the oil of 
diplomacy to be applied to the 
rough edges of these two magi- 
cians. I knew it was my duty to 
prevent friction between them, es- 
pecially now that the barrier of 
language had been removed. 

“Shoogar,” I said, “let me 
speak. I am the diplomat.” 

Without waiting for his assent, 
I approached the speakerspell, al- 
beit somewhat nervously. 

“Allow me to introduce myself. 
My name is Lant-la-lee-lay-lie-ah- 
no. Perhaps it may strike you as a 
bit presumptuous that I claim sev- 

85 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 




en syllables, but I am a person of 
no mean importance in our vil- 
lage.” I felt it necessary to estab- 
lish my rank from the very begin- 
ning, and my right to speak for the 
village. 

The stranger looked at me and 
said, ”1 am pleased to meet you. 
My name is . .” The speakerspell 
hesitated but I counted the sylla- 
bles of the name. Three. 1 smiled 
to myself. Obviously, we were 
dealing with a very low status in- 
dividual — and I realized something 
disquieting as well. Where did this 
magician come from that individu- 
als of such low status controlled 
such mighty magic? I preferred not 
to think about that. Perhaps he 
hadn’t given his full name. After 
all, I hadn’t given him the secret 
side of mine. 

The speakerspell abruptly trans- 
lated the stranger’s three-syllable 
name: ''As a color, shade of pur- 
ple gray." 

“Very odd,’’ said Shoogar, 
speaking low. “I have never known 
a magician to be named for a col- 
or.” 

“Perhaps that’s not his name but 
an indication of which god he 
serves.” 

“Nonsense,” Shoogar whispered 
back. “Then he would be either 
Something-the-Red or Something- 
the-Blue. But he isn’t either.” 

“Perhaps he’s both — that’s why 
he’s purple.” 

“Don’t talk foolishness, Lant. 
It’s impossible to serve two mas- 

86 



ters. Besides, he isn’t all purple. 
He’s Purple the Gray. And I’ve 
never heard of a gray magician.” 

I turned back to the stranger, 
“Is that your full name? How 
many syllables are in the secret 
side of it?” 

He couldn’t be offended — I was 
not asking for the name itself. 

He said, “I have given you my 
full name. As-a-shade-of-Purple- 
Gray." 

“You have no other? No secret 
name?” 

“I am not sure I understand. 
That is my full name.” 

Shoogar and 1 exchanged a 
glance. The stranger was either in- 
credibly foolish, or exceedingly 
cunning. Either he had betrayed 
his full name to us, thus delivering 
himself into Shoogar’s power, or 
he was playing the fool in order to 
keep Shoogar from discovering his 
real name. Perhaps the name he 
had given was some kind of spell 
trap. It certainly wasn’t a clue to 
his identity. 

As- A - Shade- Of- Purple- Gray 
was speaking again. “Where did 
you come from?” 

“From the village.” I started to 
point down the mountain but cov- 
ered the gesture quickly. No sense 
in telling this stranger where the 
village was located. 

“But, I saw no village from the 
air.” 

“From the air?” Shoogar asked. 

“Yes, when I flew over the 
area.” 



IF 




Shoogar’s ears perked up. 
“Flew?” You have a flying spell? 
How do you do it? I have not yet 
been able to get anything larger 
than a melon to fly — and I have 
been trapping the bubbles of nox- 
ious odor as they rise from the 
swamps.” 

Indeed, Shoogar had been trying 
to perfect a flying spell for as long 
as he had been a magician. He had ^ 
even contrived to get two of my 
sons to aid him, Willville and Or- 
bur. Often they would neglect their 
bicycle carving to work on some 
strange new device for him. So 
great was their enthusiasm for 
Shoogar’s project that they had 
been accepting no payment at all 
for their labors — much to my an- 
noyance. 

The new magician smiled at 
Shoogar’s description of his flying 
spell. 

“Primitive,” he said, “but it 
could work. My own vehicle uses 
somewhat more complex and effi- 
cient principles.” 

He pojnted at his huge black 
nest. No, he must have meant one 
of the devices in it or near it. Who 
could con^ieve of a flying nest? A 
nest is a home, a fixed place, a lo- 
cality of refuge, a place of return- 
ing. Philosophically a nest cannot 
so much as move, let alone fly. 
What is philosophically impossible 
is impossible to magic. This law 
constrains even the gods. 

“Well, show me how it works. 
Teach me your flying spell,” 



Shoogar begged him excitedly. 

The stranger shook his head. “I 
could not show that one to you 
either. It is beyond your under- 
standing.” 

T his was too much for Shoo- 
gar. All evening long this new 
magician had continued to insult 
him. Now he refused even to gift 
him with a secret. Shoogar began 
jumping up and down in exaspera- 
tion. He pulled his tarinele from 
his travel kit and had actually be- 
gun to pack the blow chambers 
with cursing powder before I could 
calm him. 

“Patience, Shoogar! Please!” I 
begged him. “Let us return to the 
village. Call for a meeting of the 
Guild of Advisors first! Don’t 
challenge him to a duel until we 
have a chance to talk this thing 
out.” 

Shoogar muttered something 
under his breath. He muttered a 
whole bunch of somethings. 

“I ought to use this tarinele on 
you. You know how I hate to 
waste a good curse.” 

But he emptied the blow cham- 
bers, wrapped it up again in its 
protective skins and returned it to 
his pack. 

He stood and faced the new ma- 
gician. 

“We return to our village to 
confer. We will visit you again be- 
fore the time of the blue dawns.” 
The stranger did not seem to 
hear the last. 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



87 




“1 will accompany you,” he 
said. “I would like to see your vil- 
lage.” 

Shoogar can be clever when he 
puts his mind to it. 

“Certainly you may accompany 
us,” he said. “It would be inhospi- 
table of us not to welcome you. 
But you cannot leave yourself so 
far from your nest. Tonight the 
moons are down and the red curses 
roam the land.” 

I wished Shoogar hadn’t 
brought that up. I remembered 
how far we were from home. The 
stranger chose not to reply. 

Shoogar spread his hands help- 
lessly. 

“If we had empty nests in the 
village, you would be welcome to 
use one — but as it is, with the time 
of total darkness approaching, I 
would not recommend straying too 
far from one’s own nest.” 

“That’s all right,” said the 
stranger, “I’ll just bring it with 
me.” 

“Huh?” said Shoogar. “How? 
We certainly are not going to help 
you. That is, neither of us has the 
strength to — ” 

As- A- Shade- Of- Purple- Gray 
seemed to laugh. 1 was becoming 
most tired of his laugh. 

“Don’t worry about that,” he 
said. “You just lead the way and 
I’ll follow.” 

Shoogar and I exchanged a 
glance. Obviously this dumpy- 
legged stranger would be unable to 
keep up with our bicycles — especi- 

88 



ally if he was going to try to bring 
his nest. We waited respectfully, 
however, while the magician col- 
lapsed his artifacts and devices. I 
was amazed to see how easily they 
folded up and how compactly they 
stored, and made a mental note to 
get closer to one of them if I 
could. 1 was curious to see how 
the bone was carved and how the 
metal was worked. Perhaps I could 
learn something from the con- 
struction of such devices. They 
were carved too precisely, too deli- 
cately for me to see much in the 
dim light. 

I glanced involuntarily at the 
sky. We were fast approaching the 
time of total darkness. Only six of 
the moons were left in the sky. No 
wonder the night was fading. I cer- 
tainly did not intend to tarry for 
this stranger. 

W ITHIN a remarkably short 
time the stranger had packed 
up all of his devices and stowed 
them within his nest. There was 
something about his manner that 
made me feel vaguely uneasy; a 
sureness of self that implied he 
knew what he was doing. 

“All right,” he said. “I’m 
ready.” 

He disappeared into his nest, 
shutting the door behind him. That 
was when my feeling of unease 
gave way to one of pure terror. 
Purple-Gray's whole nest began to 
hum like the speakerspell and the 
red-fire devices within it — but 

IF 




louder. Suddenly it rose into the 
air and hung there at twice the 
height of a man. 

I thought Shoogar would fall 
off his bicycle from astonishment. 
I was having trouble with my own 
hands and feet. Even when you are 
not trembling all over a bicycle is 
hard enough to control. 

The ride back to the village was 
a nightmare. Shoogar was so un- 
nerved he forgot to chant any of 
protective canteles — and we both 
kept looking back over our shoul- 
ders at that huge looming egg 
which came floating silently, 
dreadfully after us, throwing off 
light in all directions like some ter- 
rifying manifestation of Elcin the 
thunder god. 

And it didn’t help matters that 
every time I looked up another 
moon had set, plunging us ever 
closer to the time of total dark- 
ness. One of us was moaning. I 
wasn’t su^ whether it was Shoo- 
gar or me. 

The bicycles clattered roughly 
down the mountain path and 1 was 
so concerned about getting safely 
back to my nest that 1 did not even 
think to urge Shoogar to be care- 
ful with my other machine. The 
way he kept looking back over his 
shoulder I was sure he would hit 
something and split a wheel. For- 
tunately he did not — I did not 
know if I would have even stopped 
to help him. Not with that big 
black egg chasing us, always per- 
fectly and terrifyingly upright. 



Somehow we made it down to 
the grasslands. Several of the 
women saw us coming — they were 
out in the fields gathering the night 
fungi — but when they saw that 
huge glowing nest looming along 
behind us, they turned and ran for 
the safety of the village. Shoogar 
and I did not even think to park 
our bicycles on the hill but rode 
them right down into the settle- 
ment. The women would have to 
clean the mud from the wheels 
We reached the village none too 
soon. The last of the moons was 
just settling into the west. We 
paused, out of breath, in the cen- 
ter clearing. The great black nest 
floated ominously above us, light- 
ing up the whole village with its 
odd aura. The great trees and the 
gourd-shaped nests hanging from 
their mighty branches took on 
strange and terrifying colors. 

From out of the air the magi- 
cian’s voice boomed louder than 
any natural voice: “. no wonder 
1 didn’t see it from the air . 
houses are structured spheres, sus- 
pended from the limbs of tremen- 
dous trees . must be at least . 
Wait until . hears about this. 
Where should I park?” 

“Anywhere,” I gasped weakly. 
“Put it anywhere,” and made an 
appropriate sweeping gesture. 1 
looked around to see if we had any 
trees strong enough to hang such a 
nest from. There were none big 
enough that were not already oc- 
cupied — but if this magician could 

89 



THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 




make his nest fly, then he could 
surely hang it from even a sapling. 

But even this the stranger did 
not do. He landed it on the 
ground. 

And not just on any ground. He 
swept through the village toward 
the river and brought it to land on 
the crest of the slope overlooking 
the frog-grading ponds. The ponds 
were dry now, drained for their rit- 
ual purification and reseeding 
spells, but I was appalled at such 
callous disregard for the property 
of the village. I winced as the ma- 
gician’s nest sank into the ooze 
with a slow squishy phlooosh. 

Ill 

I DID not sleep well at all. By 
the time the smoky rim of the 
red sun began to appear over the 
horizon, I was already up and 
about. After my cleansing and pu- 
rification, I felt better but still 
haggard and drawn. The events of 
the night before had taken their 
toll. 

A glance out was enough to 
confirm that the stranger was still 
in our midst. Pilg the Crier was al- 
ready moving through the trees 
moaning of this new development. 
Disaster was all the more certain 
now that the strange magician had 
moved his nest into the village. 
Even from here I could see a curi- 
ous crowd gathering around it — 
though still keeping a respectful 
distance. 



And, the frog-monger, was 
wringing his hands and moaning 
over his frog-grading ponds. He 
would have to repurify them again 
after the stranger left — and if that 
were not soon he might miss the 
spawning season altogether. 

Shoogar and I went out to 
watch him that first day. As soon 
as he saw us he straightened from 
his examination of a local herb and 
disappeared into his nest. He re- 
turned almost immediately with an 
object in his outstretched hand. 

“A gift,” he said. “A gift for 
Shoogar the magician.” 

Shoogar was caught by surprise. 
He had not expected the stranger 
to produce the required gift. Now 
he had fulfilled his obligation as a 
magician and had the legal right to 
remain in the district. By the same 
convention, Shoogar was bound to 
respect the rights of the new magi- 
cian as well as his spells. Guild 
rules are quite specific. 

Shoogar, as resident magician, 
had the seniority. The stranger 
could do nothing to interfere with 
Shoogar’s practice or previous 
spells but, aside from that, he was 
free to do as he chose. 

Shoogar examined his gift. It 
was small and light, easily held in 
one hand. One end had a glass lens 
mounted in it. The stranger dem- 
onstrated how it worked. When 
one pressed forward on the thing’s 
sliding nerve, the glass lens made 
light. 

It was a trivial thing. I could

sense that Shoogar was disap- 
pointed and insulted that the 
stranger had not given him some- 
thing more spectacular. Shoogar 
had other ways to make cold light. 
But there was little he could say. 
It is extremely bad form to test a 
gift spell in the presence of the 
giver. 

The only advantage to the gift 
was that its light was a bright nar- 
row beam, not quite like the 
stranger’s beam of red fire, and 
certainly not as intense — but it was 
a shape of light that we had not 
seen before. 

Shoogar had had his heart set on 
the flying spell or the red fire de- 
vice. Yet manners compelled him 
to accept the gift graciously. 
Moreover, he had to remain while 
the stranger tried to make conver- 
sation. 1 

Conversation, did I say? More 
like a monologue of madness! 

“I cannot understand why your 
world has life at all,” Purple-Gray 
was saying. “Your evolution pat- 
terns don’t seem right — yet who 
would have settled here? We cer- 
tainly wouldn’t. For one thing, the 
dust clouds hide you from space. 
For another, you don’t really get 
yellow, dwarf sunlight.” Much of 
it was like that — coherent sen- 
tences trailing off into strings of 
unrelated words. “Though I sup- 
pose the red and blue combine to 
give the same effect. The plants all 
look black because there’s so little 
green light but the ... in plants 



doesn’t use the green anyway. So 
that’s all right. It’s these double 
shadows that would drive anyone 
insane.” 

S HOOGAR waited through this 
stream of gibberish with com- 
mendable patience. Purple-Gray's 
words about different colors 
seemed to hint at something very 
important and Shoogar wanted to 
know what it was. 

“You speak of ‘this world,’ ” he 
said. “May one assume that you 
know of other worlds?” I won- 
dered if Shoogar were baiting the 
stranger. 

“Oh, yes. My world — ” He 
looked up, considered, then 
pointed into the empty sky. “My 
world is in that general direction— 
I think. Beyond the dust clouds.” 
“Dust clouds?” Shoogar peered 
up into the sky. I looked also. So 
did the crowd of onlookers. “Dust 
clouds?” 

The sky was an empty blue. 
What was he talking about? 

Shoogar looked at the other 
magician. “Do you mock me? I 
see nothing. No dust clouds. No 
other worlds. There is nothing in 
the sky.” 

“Oh, but there is,” said Purple- 
Gray. “It’s just too small for you 
to see.” 

Shoogar raised an eyebrow, 
threw me a look, turned back to 
the other magician. I could sense 
some of the onlookers trying to 
restrain their mirth. Some of the

lesser women were already giggl- 
ing and had to be herded away. 

“Too small?” repeated Shoogar. 
“Too small?” 

His patience was growing thin. 
Shoogar has no temperament for 
children, fools or madmen. 

“Oh, no — you misunderstand,” 
said Purple-Gray quickly. “It’s 
too small to see because it’s so far 
away.” 

“Oh,” said Shoogar slowly. 
Purple-Gray still had not explained 
the dust clouds — or the lack of 
them. 

“Yes. In fact, it’s so far away 
that if you tried to get there on 
say, a bicycle, it would take you 
many generations. You would 
grow old and die before you had 
covered a significant fraction of 
the journey.” 

“I see,” said Shoogar. “Then 
how did you get here? By pedaling 
faster?” 

Purple-Gray laughed. “Oh, no, 
no. Even that wouldn’t help. I—” 
The speakerspell hesitated, then 
said, “Went around . .” 

The last sound was incompre- 
hensible. 

Shoogar shook his head in con- 
fusion. Several more of the wom- 
en had to be led away. It was not 
good for them to see a grown man 
making a fool of himself, nor was 
it advisable that they witness Shoo- 
gar discomfited. Several of the 
men began muttering amongst 
themselves. Shoogar gestured for 
silence — he still had not given up. 

92 



“Went around?’’ he asked. 
“Went around what? The dust 
clouds?” 

“Oh, no. I went through the 
dust clouds. I went around . .” 
Shoogar repeated this sentence 
slowly, to see if there were some- 
thing in it he had missed. He 
looked at Purple and shook his 
head. 

“Uh-uh,’’ he said. “Uh-uh.’’ 
That was all, just: “Uh-uh.” 

He turned and walked away, up 
the slope, shaking his head and 
turning the small light-making de- 
vice over and over in his hands. 

P URPLE-GRAY spent the 
next several days collecting 
small plants, pieces of larger 
plants, handfuls of mud and water 
and dirt. There were plenty of 
sprats and adults to watch him but 
he took little notice of them. 

A floating, three-legged, click- 
ing device followed him about with 
its legs folded, unnoticed and un- 
tended until he needed it. Each 
time he took a sample of some- 
thing he would mount this device 
on its legs and point it at the site. 
It seemed a harmless enough test- 
ing device but Shoogar would grit 
his teeth every time it came float- 
ing by. 

Shoogar went into seclusion 
then, determined to discover the 
secret of the stranger’s light-mak- 
ing device. When I visited him for 
the purpose of checking his prog- 
ress he glared angrily at me. 



IF 




He muttered, “Curse that sin- 
gle-shadowed demon!” 

“Perhaps it would help if you 
tried to find out which god the 
spell draws its power from.” ( 

Shoogar gave me another look, 
more scathing than the first. 

“Do I tell you how to carve 
bone? Why do you tell me magic? < 
Don’t you think I know my own 
business? I have already tested this 
device for the presence of every ' 
god in the known pantheon and it 
responds to none.” 

“Perhaps,” I suggested, “per- i 
haps it is based on a different prin- 
ciple. Purple appears not to call on 
any gods at all. Could it be < 
that — ” ^ 

Then how does he work his de- < 
vices?” Shoogar demanded. “By ' 
superstition?” 

“I don’t know — but perhaps he 
draws his power from some differ- 
ent source. Or perhaps — ” 

“Lant, you are a fool. Why do 
you continue to prattle on about 
things you do not know? If you 
are going to try to talk to a magi- 
cian about magic you should at 
least try to talk intelligently.” 

“But that’s why I’m asking — ” < 

“Superstition, Lant, is harmless 
prattle that gets repeated so often 
that people start to believe it — and 1 
then it is no longer harmless. The ( 
belief of the people gives it power. 
Magic, on the other hand, involves ( 
a carefully constructed equation of 
symbols intended to control spe- 
cialized forces or objects. Magic 

THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



works whether one believes in it or 
not.” 

“I understand that,” I said. 
“And I do not think that Purple 
operates by superstition.” 

“Nor do I,” said Shoogar. “His 
powers are too great.” 

“But it does not appear that he 
operates by magic either.” 

“Are you suggesting that the 
stranger’s devices are independent 
of the gods?” 

Shoogar’s look and tone made 
it clear that he felt he was talking 
to an imbecile. 

I stiffened my tone. “Such a 
thing is not impossible. Willville 
once confessed to me that he has 
often test-ridden new bicycles with- 
out bothering to bless them first. 
One grows careless and forgets. 
But nothing evil has ever happened 
to him.” 

“Willville and Orbur are under 
my protection — remember?” said 
Shoogar. “In payment for helping 
to construct a flying spell.” 

“Yes, I remember — I had pre- 
ferred that they take money.” 
Shoogar ignored me. “I am pro- 
tecting both your sons as a matter 
of course, so Willville’s occasional 
ride on an unblessed bicycle proves 
nothing. Besides, if everything else 
has been properly prepared, the bi- 
cycle blessing is superfluous.” 

“I still say that such a thing as a 
device independent of the gods 
might be possible.” 

Shoogar gave me a look. 

“You seem sure of yourself.” 



93 




“As a boy, I once used an un- 
blessed fishing rod I had made.” 
“So?” 

“So, I caught a fish.” 

Shoogar snorted. “It still proves 
nothing, Lant. If you had blessed 
that rod and washed your hook as 
you should have you might have 
caught ten times as many fish. All 
that you proved otherwise was that 
you had constructed a usable fish- 
ing rod. What you needed for that 
experiment was a valid control — 
an identical fishing pole that had 
been blessed and washed. Then you 
would have* seen which one could 
catch the most fish.” 

“You talk as if you have done 
such an experiment.” 

“Not with fish, no. But with 
traps.” My surprise must have 
shown, for he said, “As an appren- 
tice, every new magician must 
prove to his own satisfaction, at 
least once, that there is truly great 
power in magic. One cannot be a 
magician if there is a seed of doubt 
in his mind. By allowing the ap- 
prentice to satisfy his curiosity, we 
generate faith in him. It is a sim- 
ple experiment — one that anyone 
can construct for himself — a test 
that can be repeated as often as 
you choose. Each time the results 
are the same and can be verified.” 
“And what happens?” 

“The traps with the blessed bait 
will catch twice as many rabbits.” 
“So? Maybe it was only because 
the bait is more attractive to the 
rabbits.” 



“Of course. I would expect you 
to put it into layman’s terms,” 
said Shoogar. “But that’s 'exactly 
what it is supposed to do. The 
whole purpose of the spell is to 
make the bait more attractive. 
These traps are simple devices, 
Lant. A simple device may not al- 
ways need magic — but when it is 
used the results are easily demon- 
strable. Now, how many parts 
were there to your fishing pole?” 
“Three. Stick, line and hook.” 
“Right. There is little that can 
go wrong with it, but still the 
string can break or the bait can 
slip off or the hook may not catch. 
And this is only a simple device — 
a thing that does not have to be 
very precise. Think, Lant! What of 
the construction that has many 
moving parts? It has to have all of 
them in absolute working order 
before'any of them will work. 
What of, say, the bicycle?” 

I STARTED to answer but he 
cut me off. “Don’t interrupt. 
The bicycle has many moving 
parts, the wheels, the pulleys, the 
steering bar, the pedals, the axles. 
All of these things must be preci- 
sion carved and in delicate adjust- 
ment with each other or the device 
simply will not work. Now, theo- 
retically, a perfect machine is pos- 
sible. But in practice — well, when 
you get a machine that has to be 
that precise simply to function, 
that is when the effect of the magic 
becomes most important. If only 

IF 



94 




one part fails — one part — the 
whole machine is useless. The sim- 
ple device does not need magic, so 
its effect is enhanced by the simpl- 
est of spells. But a complex device 
needs a more complex spell just to 
keep it working at all. There is 
Just too much that can go wrong. 
Tell me, Lant, how’ many parts are 
there to a bicycle?’’ 

1 shrugged. “I have never 
counted. A good many, I would 
guess.” 

Shoogar nodded, “And how 
many parts does the stranger’s fly- 
ing nest have?’' 

I shook my head. “I don’^ 
know.” 

“More than a bicycle?” 

“Undoubtedly,” 1 said. 

“Very perceptive of you, Lant. 1 
feel sure that there must be at least 
a thousand different parts in that 
flying nest. From my own flying 
experiments, I can tell you that a 
flying spell is a very complex de- 
vice indeed. Purple-Gray's nest 
must have many moving parts, all 
of them working together in preci- 
sion. The smallest error and 
nothing happens. It’s quite obvious 
to me that the more parts a ma- 
chine has, the more opportunities 
it has to go wrong. Now, are you 
going to stand there and try to tell 
me that the stranger keeps all of 
those various parts working in ab- 
solute precision without the aid of 
any magic at all?” 

I shook my head. Shoogar made 
a very convincing case. He had cer- 

THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



tainly given the whole matter much 
more thought than I had imagined. 
But, of course, that was his job as 
magician. It was reassuring to 
know that he was doing it so well. 

I beamed proudly at him. 

“Then the same thing must ap- 
ply to all of his other devices, 
right?” 

Shoogar nodded, “You are be- 
ginning to see the obvious, Lant.” 
“They must need so much mag- 
ic that they must be reeking of 
spells, right?” 

Shoogar nodded again. 

“Then, you have already figured 
out the secret of the light device^, 
Shoogar? It is so complex that it 
is obvious, right?” 

“Wrong. It is so simple that it is 
a mystery.” 

“Huh?” 

“The most I’ve been able to do 
is to take the device apart but 
look at what that leaves me!'’ He 
waves his hand at a workbench. On 
it were only four pieces, the ele- 
ments of the stranger’s light. These 
consisted of a hollow shell, a crys- 
tal lens, a flat plate and an interior 
canister, roughly the same shape 
as the outer shell. Shoogar turned 
this flat bulging object over and 
over in his hands but he could not 
find an opening. It was hard and. 
solid and we both puzzled over 
what it might contain. It resisted 
all our attempts to open it and 
Shoogar would not use force for 
fear of destroying the devices with- 
in. 



95 




“And you have been able to 
make no changes at all in its con- 
dition?” I prompted. 

“Not exactly. I have made one 
change.” 

“And what is that?” 

“The light. It has failed com- 
pletely and will no longer glow.” 
“Oh.” 

Shoogar glumly fitted the pieces 
together again as I watched. He 
activated the sliding nerve. Noth- 
ing happened. 

“I thought not,” he muttered. 
“I had hoped the spell might re- 
store itself if given a chance to rest 
— but apparently I was mistaken.” 

“Why don’t you take it back to 
Purple?” I suggested. 

Shoogar whirled on me. “What? 
Do you think I am not capable 
enough on my own to solve this 
problem?” 

“No, Shoogar,” I protested. “I 
am sure you are capable. I just 
thought that — well, perhaps Pur- 
ple has done something to cancel 
the original spell that you can’t 
know about. Perhaps he has in- 
sulted some god.” 

Shoogar considered this. “You 
could be right. You’re sure you’re 
not doubting my ability as a magi- 
cian?” 

He peered at me. Hastily I reas- 
sured him. 

“Shoogar, I have no doubts 
about the level of your knowl- 
edge.” 

This seemed to placate him. 

“Good. Then we can pay a visit 



to Purple and find out why the de- 
vice doesn’t work.” 

IV 

W E FOUND Purple out in the 
west pasture, doing some- 
thing with a set of his devices. I 
looked for — but did not see — the 
red-fire device. Apparently, he had 
not brought it with him. The de- 
vices he was using here in the 
meadow seemed to be harmless. 

Purple was puttering contented- 
ly, murmuring and humming busi- 
ly to himself when Shoogar inter- 
rupted and handed him the device. 
Purple took it, fiddled with it sev- 
eral times, then opened it and ex- 
amined the cylinder within. He 
noted that its surface had gone 
red. 

“Well^ of course it won’t work. 
The battery is dead.” 

Shoogar went pale. “The bat- 
tery? Why did you not tell me 
there was a living creature within 
this device? I did not even know 
what to feed it.” 

“No, no,” said Purple with a 
laugh. “You don’t understand.” 

“I understand all too well,” said 
Shoogar. “You entrusted a living 
creature into my care without even 
telling me. And it is no wonder 
that it died — imprisoned in that 
tiny box without food or water! 
You have caused the death of a 
living being to be on my head and 
now I must offer up prayers for its 
soul.” 



96 



IF 




Purple managed to check his 
laughter. 

“Listen to me, Shoogar. Listen. 

A battery is not a living creature. 

It is a device, a thing that stores 
power.” 

“Oh,” said Shoogar. “A latent 
spell.” He smoothed his fur and 
said in a calmer tone. “Well, which 
god must I placate in order to re- 
store its power to it?” 

Again Purple laughed. “You 
still do not understand. Here, give 
it to me and I will do it for you.” 
He reached for the device but/ 
Shoogar did not give it to him. 

“Why will ycrU not tell me how 
to restore it?” demanded Shoogar. 
“What good will the device be to 
me, if I must continually come to 
you when its power is exhausted? 
What kind of a magician would 
that make me look like? And fur- 
thermore, what happens after you 
leave — how will I restore it then? 

If I at least knew which gods — ” 

“No gods,” said Purple. “No 
gods at all. Your gods are not 
able to restore this device’s power. 
Here, give it to me, Shoogar. I 
will do it.” 

Shoogar jerked his hand back as 
if stung. “The gods not able to re- 
store the device’s power? Only 
you?” 

“Relax, Shoogar,” Purple said. 
“The device works without the 
gods. It doesn’t need them.” 

Shoogar said slowly, carefully, 
“Do you mock me? No device 
works without the gods.” 

THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



“This one does. So do the rest 
of my devices.” 

Shoogar gently stiffened his 
tone. “Purple, you are not making 
sense. It sounds as if you are de- 
nying the power of the gods. Such 
talk will cause Elcin to rain light- 
ening down upon your head. I urge 
you to — ” 

“That would be true,” Purple 
interrupted, “if there were an El- 
cin. Or any other god. You have 
over a thousand gods here — and I 
still have not numbered them all. 
Oh, these primitive superstitions, 
born out of the ignorant need to 
explain the inexplicable. I’m sorry, 
Shoogar — I can’t explain it to 
you. You’re as much its victim as 
its master.” 

Abruptly, he was silent. 

“Is that all?” Shoogar asked. 

“Yes, I’m afraid so,” the other 
replied. 

Shoogar looked thoughtfully at 
the device he still held in his hands. 

“Purple,” he began slowly and 
evenly — his voice showed great 
control. “Were it not for your de- 
vices I would think you either a 
fool or a blaspheming red magi- 
cian. But the abilities of your de- 
vices are such that you can be nei- 
ther foolish nor false. Therefore 
you must be something else.” He 
paused, then said, “I want to know 
what that something is. In your 
conversations you continually re- 
fer to things that do not make 
sense but they hint at meaning. I 
am sure that you know things that 

97 




I do not. Your devices prove that. 
I wish to learn these secrets.” He 
paused again — it was very hard for 
him to say what he said next. 
“Will you teach me?” 

Shoogar’s words startled me. I 
had never heard him so humble. 
His passion for the secrets of the 
stranger must have been all-con- 
suming for him to abase himself 
like that. 

P urple looked at Shoogar 
for a long moment. 

“Yes,” he said, almost to him- 
self. “It is the only way — teach the 
local shamans^ let them introduce 
the knowledge. All right. Look, 
Shoogar, you must first under- 
stand that the gods are not gods at 
all but manifestations of your be- 
lief.” 

Shoogar nodded. “That theory 
is not unfamiliar to me.” 

“Good,” said Purple. “Perhaps 
you are not as primitive as I 
thought.” 

“This theory,” continued Shoo- 
gar, “is one of the key theories up- 
on which all of magic is based — 
that the gods will take the forms 
necessary to their functions and 
those functions are determined 
by—” 

“No, no.” Purple cut him off. 
“Listen. Your people do not un- 
derstand how the moons make the 
tides, so you create N’veen, the 
god of tides and patron of map- 
makers. You do not understand 
how the winds are created by great 

98 



masses of hot air, so you create 
Musk-Watz, the god of winds. 
You do not understand the rela- 
tionship between cause and effect, 
so you create Leeb, the god of 
magic.” 

Shoogar frowned but he nodded. 
He was trying very hard to follow 
this. 

“I can understand how it hap- 
pened, Shoogar,” said Purple con- 
descendingly. “It’s no wonder you 
have so many gods — single god 
worship starts with a single sun. 
Here you have two suns and elev- 
en moons. Your system is hidden 
away in a dust cloud — ” He saw 
that Shoogar was frowning, and 
said quickly, “No, forget that last. 
It would only confuse you.” 

Shoogar nodded. 

“Now, listen to this carefully. 
There is something more than 
these gods of yours, Shoogar, but 
you and your people have forgot- 
ten that you have created the gods 
yourselves, and you have come to 
believe that it is the other way 
around — that the gods have cre- 
ated you.” 

Shoogar flinched at this but he 
said nothing. 

“I will try to teach you what I 
can. I will be glad to. The sooner 
you and your people are ready to 
lay aside your primitive supersti- 
tions and accept the one true — ” 
here, the speakerspell hesitated 
again — “magic, the sooner will 
you inherit — the lights in the sky.” 

“Huh?” said Shoogar. “What 

IF 




lights in the sky? Do you mean 
those faint non-substantial things 
that appear at random and rarely 
in the same place twice?” 

Purple nodded, “You are not 
able to see them as I am — but 
some day, Shoogar, some day, 
your people will build their own 
flying spells and—” 

“Yes, that’s it,” said Shoogar 
eagerly. “Show me the flying spell. 
What gods — ” 

“No gods, Shoogar. That what 
I have been trying to explain to 
you. ^he flying spell is not derived 
from the gods but from men. Men 
like myself.” 

Shoogar started to open his 
mouth to protest, but he swal- 
lowed mightily instead. 

“Derived from men?” 

Purple nodded. 

“It must be a simpler spell than 
I imagined — you’ll teach me?” 

“I can’t,” Purple protested. 

“Can’t? You just said you 
would.” 

“No, no — I meant that I would 
teach you my — ” the speakerspell 
seemed to be having some trouble 
with the word — “magic. But I 
can’t teach you my flying spell.” 

Shoogar shook his head as if to 
clear it. 

“Your flying spell is not magic 
then?” 

“No, it isn’t. It’s — ” again the 
device hesitated — “it’s magic.” 

I COULD see that Shoogar’s 
temper was shortening. 

THE AAISSPELLEDAAAGICIAN 



“Are you or are you not going 
to teach me how to fly?” 

“Yes — but it is your people who 
will fly — ” 

“Then what good is it to me?” 

“I mean your children and your 
grandchildren.” 

“I have no children.” 

“I did not mean it that way,” 
Purple said. “I meant — your peor 
pie’s children and your grandchil- 
dren. The spell is so complex that 
it will take many years to learn 
and build.” 

“Then let us begin,” prompted 
Shoogar impatiently. 

“But we can’t,” Purple pro- 
tested. “Not until you learn the 
basics of — magic.” 

“I already know the basics of 
magic. Teach me the flying spell.” 
“I can’t. It’s too difficult for 
you.” 

“Then why did you say you 
would if you wouldn’t?” 

“I didn’t say I wouldn’t. I said I 
couldn’t.” 

That was when Shoogar got 
mad. 

“May you have many ugly 
daughters,” he began. “May the 
parasites from ten thousand mud- 
creatures infest your codpiece!” 
His voice rose to a fearful pitch. 
“May dry rot take your nesting 
tree! May you never receive a gift 
that pleases you! May the God of 
Thunder strike you in the knee- 
cap!” 

They were only words, nothing 
more, but coming from Shoogar 

99 




they were enough to pale even me, 
an innocent bystander. I wondered 
if my hair would fall out from wit- 
nessing such a display of anger. 

Purple was unmoved — and I 
must credit him for his courage in 
the face of such fury. 

“I have already told you, Shoo- 
gar, that I am not concerned with 
your magic. I am above such 
things.” 

Shoogar took another breath. 
“If you do not cease and desist, 1 
will be forced to use this.” 

Shoogar produced from the 
folds of his robe, a doll. I knew 
from its odd proportions and col- 
ors that the doll had been carved 
to represent Purple. 

Purple did not even quail as any 
normal man would have done. 1 
knew then that he must be mad. 

“Use it,” he said. “Go ahead 
and use it. But don’t interrupt me 
in my work. Your world-life-sys- 
tem-balance has developed in a 
fascinating direction. The animals 
have developed some of the most 
unusual fluids-secreted-for-the- 
control-of-bodily-functions that I 
have ever seen.” 

Purple bent back to his devices, 
did something to one of them, a 
stabbing gesture with a single fore- 
finger, and a whole section of the 
west pasture erupted. 

Shoogar covered his eyes in de- 
spair. Purple had just violated one 
of the finest pastures of the village 
— one of the favorite pastures of 

100 



Rotn’bair, the god of sheep. Who 
knew what the mutton would taste 
like this winter? 

Then, to add injury to insult. 
Purple began gathering fragments 
of the meadow and putting them 
into little containers. He was tak- 
ing the droppings. 

Was it possible for one man to 
violate so many of the basic laws 
of magic and still survive? The 
laws of magic are strict. Any fool 
can see them in operation every 
day. Eveh I am familiar with 
them. They operate the entire 
world and their workings are sim- 
ple and obvious. 

But Purple, this man of the fly- 
ing nest, was blind even to the sim- 
plest of spells. 

I was not surprised when Shoo- 
gar, grimly intent, set the doll 
down on the grass and set it afire. 
Neither was I surprised when the 
doll had burned itself into a pinch 
of white ash without Purple even 
bothering to notice. 

Purple ignored it — and us. He 
showed not the slightest effect. 
Flaming sting things! What pow- 
ers this magician must have! 
Shoogar stared at him aghast. 

Purple’s very casualness was the 
ultimate insult. When we left him 
he had one of his clicking boxes 
open and was fumbling inside. He 
never even noticed our going. 

V 

S HOOGAR was peering into 
the sky, a frown on his face. 



IF 




Both suns were still high — 
broad red disc and blue-white 
point. The blue sun was poised on 
the edge of the red, ready to begin 
the long crawl across its face. 

“Elcin’s wrath!” he muttered. 

“I cannot use the suns — all is un- 
stable. Damn the conjunction! 
That leaves me only the moons — 
and the moons are well into the 
mud-skunk.” He hurled a fireball 
across the clearing. “An eight- 
mooned mud-skunk at that!” He 
put his hands on his hips and 
shouted into the sky, “Why me. 
Quells? Why me? What have I 
done to offend you that you curse 
me with such unusable configura- 
tions? Have I not sworn my life to 
your service?” 

There was no answer. I don’t 
think Shoogar expected one. He 
turned back to his spell devices. 

“All right then. If it is a mud- 
skunk you have given me, it is 
a mud-skunk I shall use. Here, 
Lant, hold this.” 

He thrust a large pack at me. 

He continued to rummage 
through his equipment, all the 
while muttering under his breath. 

A fearful collection of cursing de- 
vices began to grow around him. 

I indicated the pile. 

“What is all this for?” 

He appeared not to hear me, 
continued checking off items in 
his head, then began loading them 
into the pack. 

“What is all this for?” I re- 
peated. 

THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



Shoogar looked at me. “Lant, 
you are a fool. This,” he said, and 
hefted his kit meaningfully, “is to 
show the stranger that one does 
not trifle with the gods of the full 
belly.” 

“I’m afraid to ask. What is it?” 

“It’s the spell of the — No, 
you’ll just have to wait and see it 
in action, with the others.” He 
strode purposefully toward the 
frog-grading ponds. I hurried after 
him. It was amazing how fast 
Shoogar’s squat little legs could 
carry him. 

An uneasy crowd of villagers 
was already standing on the rise 
above the flying nest — none dared 
approach it. When Shoogar ap- 
peared an excited murmur ran 
through the crowd. Word of Pur- 
ple’s insult had spread quickly. 
The villagers were tense with ex- 
pectation. 

Shoogar ignored them. He 
pushed through the milling throng 
and strode angrily to Purple’s nest, 
ignoring the mud that splashed up 
and over his ankles and stained the 
hem of his robe. 

He strode around the nest three 
times without pause, looking at it 
from all sides. I was unsure wheth- 
er he had already started spelling 
or whether he was still sizing up 
the situation. For a long moment 
he stood looking at the landward 
side of that nest, like an artist con- 
templating a blank skin. 

Abruptly he made up his mind. 
He stepped quickly forward and 



101 



with a piece of chalk inscribed the 
sign of the horned box on the side 
of Purple’s nest. 

An interested murmur of specu- 
lation rose from the crowd. 

“The horned box — the horned 
box — ’’ 

This spell would be under the 
domain of Rotn’bair, the sheep 
god. Members of the crowd dis- 
cussed it busily among themselves. 
Rotn’bair is neither very powerful 
nor very irritable — compared to 
Elcin, that is. Most of the Rotn’- 
bairic spells deal with fertility and 
food-gathering. Few things will 
anger the sheep god — but if Rotn- 
’bair could be angered, Shoogar 
would know how. The crowd mur- 
mured with an excited curiosity, 
each speculating on just what 
form the final spell would take. 

Shoogar finished the sketch. 
Absent-mindedly wiping the chalk 
from his hands, he strode down to 
the mudbanks of the river. He 
paced back and forth along its 
edge, casting about for something. 
Abruptly he spotted what he was 
looking for, something just below 
the surface of the water. He 
grabbed quickly for it, his hands 
dipping into the river with no 
splash at all. When he straight- 
ened, the sleeves of his robe were 
dripping but I saw a brownish slug 
in his hands and after a moment I 
caught the odor of mud-skunk. 

T he scent reached the rest 
of the crowd at the same time 



and a murmur of approval went 
up from them. The antipathy be- 
tween Rotn’bair, the sheep god, 
and Nils’n, the god of the mud 
creatures, was known even to lay- 
men. Evidently, Shoogar was con- 
structing a spell that would play 
on the mutual antipathy of the 
two gods. 

My guess was right — I pride 
myself on a fairly good under- 
standing of the basic principles of 
magic. Shoogar slit the belly of 
the mud-skunk and deftly extract- 
ed its anger gland. Carefully he 
placed this into a bone bowl. I rec- 
ognized the bowl, having carved 
and cleansed it for him myself. It 
was made from the skull of a new- 
born lamb and had been sanctified 
to Rotn’bair. Now he was defiling 
it with the most odious portion of 
the mud creature. No doubt, he 
now had Rotn’bair’s attention. 

He laid the bowl to one side and 
returned to the mud-skunk which 
lay writhing in a swampy pool. He 
picked it up and deftly sliced off 
its head without even offering up 
a prayer for its soul. Thus he de- 
filed its death. Now he surely had 
Nils’n’s attention. 

Using the bladder of the slug as 
a mixing bag, he began to con- 
struct a potion of powdered rams- 
bone, extract of hunger, odor of 
sheepsblood and several other ele- 
ments that I could not identify— 
but I suspected that all of them 
were designed to arouse the wrath 
of Nils’n although in what man- 

IF 



102 




ner was not yet completely clear. 

Shoogar surveyed the nest of 
the mad magician on its riverward 
side. Then he began to paint his 
soupy potion in broad lines across 
its round black flank in a pattern 
of eleven stripes by eleven. Having 
finished, he sketched in the sign of 
the deformed changeling, the fa- 
vored son of the sheep god. This 
Cas the half of the spell which 
would anger Nils’n. Shoogar had 
defiled a mud creature in order to 
celebrate the greatness of Rotn’- 
bair. To complete the other half 
of the spell, Shoogar would now 
desecrate his earlier celebration of 
Rotn^’bair, the horned box 
sketched on the other side of the 
nest. 

He returned to the bone bowl, 
the one containing the anger gland 
of the mud-skunk. Using the leg- 
bone of a ram, he crushed the 
gland into a sick-smelling paste. 
This he mixed with ramsblood, de- 
filed water and a greenish powder 
from his travel kit. I recognized 
that powder. It was an extract of 
fear, usually used where potent 
action is desired. It is derived 
from animals of the cloven hoof. 
Six sheep must have been sacri- 
ficed just to provide the small 
amount Shoogar was now mixing 
into his spell. 

Stepping to the landward side of 
the nest and chanting a song of 
praise for Nils’n, Shoogar began 
painting a familiar symbol across 
the chalk sketch of the horned 

THE MISSPELLED MAGICIAN 



box. It was the sign of Nils’n, a 
diagonal slash with an empty cir- 
cle on either side. 

The crowd gasped appreciative- 
ly. Such originality in spellcasting 
was a delight to behold. No won- 
der he was called Shoogar the 
Tall. Rotn’bair would not allow 
such a desecration of his sheep. 
And Nils’n, the god of mud crea- 
tures, would not long be compla- 
cent while mud-skunks were being 
sacrificed to Rotn’bair. 

The antipathy of the two gods 
is demonstrated every time .the 
sheep are led to the river. Sheep 
are careless and clumsy and, as 
they mill about on the banks, they 
trample scores of frogs, snakes, 
salamanders, lizards, chameleons, 
and other amphibians that live in 
the mud. At the same time many 
of the more dangerous mud crea- 
tures, the poisonous ones, the 
ones with venom, lash back at the 
sheep, cutting their legs, ruining 
their wool, infecting them with 
parasites, giving them festering 
sores, leaving them bleeding from 
assorted cuts and slashes. The two 
gods hate each other and, in their 
various incarnations — the sheep 
and the mud creatures — they work 
to destroy each other at every op- 
portunity. 

Now Shoogar had inscribed in- 
sults to both upon the same nest. 
He had defiled creatures of each 
in order to celebrate the greatness 
of the other. If Purple did not 
make immediate amends, he 

103 




would have to suffer the wrath of 
both simultaneously. 

Purple had said he did not be- 
lieve in the gods. He denied their 
existence. He denied their powers. 
And he had stated that he was 
above Shoogar’s magic. 

I hoped he would return in time 
to see the spell take effect. 

I followed Shoogar down to the 
river and helped him with his ritu- 
al purification. He had to cleanse 
himself of the odor of offense 
against the gods, lest he be caught 
up in his own curse. Sometimes 
the gods are nearsighted. We 
bathed him with six different oils 
before we even let him step into 
the river. No sense in offending 
Filfo-mar, the river god. 

Even before we finished with 
the cleansing we could hear the 
curse beginning. We could hear 
the cheers of the crowd and under 
that was a dull sort of booming. 
Without even stopping to dry off, 
Shoogar wrapped his robe around 
himself and hurried back up the 
hill, with me trailing excitedly in 
his wake. 

W E REACHED the crest of 
the hill in time to see an an- 
gry ram butting his head insistent- 
ly against the side of Purple’s nest. 
More rams were arriving and 
they, too, began to attack that 
looming black globe. The focus of 
their anger was the desecrated 
homage to Rotn’bair and the very 
substance of the Nils’n symbol 

104 



seemed enough to anger them. 
The smell of the mud-skunk was- 
potent enough to raise anyone’s 
hackles. 

Red-eyed and breathing heavily, 
the rams jostled and shoved and 
butted even at each other in their 
frenzy to attack that odious dese- 
cration on the side of Purple’s 
nest. Each time they struck it that 
same dreadful booming echoed up 
and down the hill and each time a 
great cheer went up from the 
crowd. I expected at any moment 
to see one of the rams go crash- 
ing through the walls of that fear- 
ful nest but no — those walls were 
stronger than I had thought. Per- 
haps even as strong as metal. 

The only effect I could see was 
that each time a ram struck it, it 
seemed to lift slightly out of the 
mud for a moment before sinking 
wetly bade. The rams, in their 
bleating frenzy, continued to 
strike at that offensive spot, as if 
they themselves were the very in- 
carnation of Rotn’bair’s anger. 
Again and again they hurtled at 
that dull black surface. 

Old Khart, the lead ram, had al- 
ready shattered both of his horns 
(sacred items in themselves — I 
mourned the loss) and several of 
the other rams were also bleeding 
profusely. Their eyes were red 
with fury. Their nostrils flared 
wide. Their breath came in hot 
puffs of steam and the sounds of 
bleating and snorting filled the air 
with a madness born of wrath. The 



IF 




steam rose from their sides and 
their hooves slashed wetly through 
the ground, churning the grass and 
mud into a meaningless soup. 

Already some of the rams were 
having trouble with their footing 
and indeed, as we watched, one of 
the older ones slipped and slid 
through the mud. He crashed 
against two others and brought 
them both down with him. All 
three were caught under the fren- 
zied, slashing hooves of the others. 

The once white wool of the ani- 
mals was now stained with washes 
of pink and darker spots of red. 
Most of the rams were bleeding 
about their horns and heads and 
many had gaping wounds where 
they had been gored by one an- 
other’s frenzy. 

Th^ir angry snorts were punctu- 
ated with grunts of pain and by 
the dull thud and hollow boom 
that rolled up and down the slope 
each time they struck the side of 
Purple’s nest. But the creatures 
had strength beyond all natural 
endurance and continued to clam- 
ber over one another, continued to 
butt at that offending spell. 

Each time they struck it the 
nest rose up out of the ground and 
threatened to slide down the slope 
and into the river. But each time it 
would pause and then sag wetly 
back into its hollowed out cradle 
of mud. Several times it trapped 
slow-footed beasts under the curve 
of its wall. I felt a great surge of 
emotion within myself — any mo- 

THEAAISSPELLEDAAAGICIAN 



ment now Purple’s great egg- 
shaped nest would be toppled onto 
its side. 

Abruptly three of the rams hit 
the nest at the same time and it 
seemed to leap into the air. One 
more struck it at just the right in- 
stant and as it rose out of its hol- 
low it just seemed to keep on 
moving. Suddenly it was sliding 
downslope with a great wet slosh. 
Angry rams scrambled after it, 
butting at it all the way down, 
churning the mud with their 
hooves and leaving a long angry 
scar through Ang’s carefully ter- 
raced frog-grading pools. I shout- 
ed in triumph with the rest. 

The great black globe slid into 
the river with a resounding thud 
and a splash, a loud cheer of de- 
light and victory went up from the 
villagers. Only I was silent, for on- 
ly 1 had noticed that the terrible 
nest was still upright, that it had 
not canted even a thumbnail’s 
width. Had Shoogar noticed, too? 
His puzzled frown was a match 
for mine. 

But the nest was in the river. 
The rams slid and skidded down 
the slope, destroying what was 
left of the frog pools in the pro- 
cess. Almost joyfully they leaped 
into the water, still butting at the 
nest. 

Others milled around the banks, 
churning the mud. Mud-skunks 
and salamanders ran panic-strick- 
en under their hooves and a new 
shade of red added itself to the 

105 




stains on the heaving flanks of the 
crazed rams. Crushed mud-skunk 
mingled with the blood of the 
sheep and the terrible smell 
reached us on the crest of the hill, 
along with the hysterical splashing 
and bleating. 

N OW the black nest was within 
Nils’n’s reach. So far only 
Rotn’bair had had a chance to 
avenge his insult — now it was 
Nils’n’s turn. The banks boiled 
with life as salamanders, lizards, 
crabs, venom-bearing snakes and 
other river creatures came swarm- 
ing up out of the mud and dark- 
ness. They scrambled across the 
churning surface and attacked 
anything that moved, even each 
other, but more often the rams. 

The rams continued to butt at 
the nest, oblivious to the mud 
creatures caught in their wool, 
hanging from their flanks, biting 
and slashing at their legs. Their 
once proud flanks, now torn and 
slashed, were stained with angry 
strokes of red and great washes of 
muddy brown river water. It was 
an awe-inspiring sight, sheep and 
mud-creatures together attacking 
that ominously unmoving nest. 

The villagers stood on the 
flanks of the hill and cheered the 
frenzied activity below. One or 
two of the braver shepherds tried 
to work their way down the slope 
but the snapping claws of the mud 
crabs drove them quickly back up 
to the crest. 



The rams were slowing down 
but they still continued to mill 
about Purple’s nest, clambering 
over the occasional body of a fal- 
len comrade, refusing to cease 
even in victory. The water was 
pink. Angry mud-skunks swarmed 
along both banks of the river. It 
was a heartening sight. The crowd 
continued to cheer wildly and be- 
gan to chant a chorus of praise to 
Shoogar. Pilg the Crier was lead- 
ing them. 

Down below, their anger spent, 
some of the rams were climbing 
back up the hill, slipping and skid- 
ding in their own blood and falling 
back down the mudslicked sur- 
face. But for the most part nearly 
all the rams were able to climb 
out. Only two or three slipped be- 
neath the water and failed to sur- 
face. 

The mud creatures, too, were 
beginning to calm — and the shep- 
herds once more dared to work 
their way carefully down the 
slopes to tend their wounded 
flock. 

“A beautiful spell, Shoogar,” I 
congratulated him, “Beautiful. 
And so powerful.” 

Indeed, as the churning foam of 
the river continued to subside, re- 
vealing the full extent of the devas- 
tation, several of the villagers 
even began to mutter that perhaps 
the spell had been a bit too power- 
ful. 

One of the members of the 
Guild of Advisors remarked 



106 



IF 




thoughtfully, “Look at all this de- 
struction — this spell should be 
banned.” 

“Banned?” I confronted the 
man. “And leave us defenseless 
before strangers?” 

“Well,” he amended, “perhaps 
we should only keep Shoogar 
from using it on friends. We could 
still use it on strangers.” 

I nodded. I would accept that. 
Certainly a spell that wreaked this 
much havoc should be used with 
discretion. 

Meanwhile, at least eleven of 
our sheep lay dead or dying in the 
churned mud of the slope, mud 
creatures feeding indiscriminately 
on their stilled or still heaving 
flanks. Some of the rams were 
trampled almost into the land- 
scape. Others lay with their heads 
at oddly twisted angles, their 
necks broken from butting against 
Purple’s nest. Three bodies lay be- 
low the water with their mouths 
open. 

What remained of the flock 
would show countless mud-skunk 
bites upon their legs and flanks. 
Many of those bites would un- 
doubtedly become festering sores 
and probably more of the rams 
would die later. 



The vermin of the mud would 
be vicious for days to come. It 
would not be safe to bathe for a 
while and probably the sheep 
would not dare to return to the 
river for a long time. They would 
have to be led to the mountain 
streams to drink. 

The frog-grading ponds had 
been completely obliterated and 
would have to be resculptured 
elsewhere. Ang stood moaning 
and wringing his hands as he sur- 
veyed his mud-churned slope. 

And finally, the wreck of the 
mad magician’s nest now blocked 
the river. Dammed water spilled 
over the south bank in a torrent. 
Already it was carving a new 
course for itself. 

And none of it mattered. These 
were all small prices to pay for 
the damage done to the stranger. 
Considering the magnitude of the 
task, it was one of Shoogar’s less 
expensive efforts and we were 
proud of him. 

Then why was the scene so ut- 
terly silent? 

I looked to my left and saw 
Purple standing on the crest of the 
hill.

something trembles in the 
night, something whispers in 
the stars, something very 
ancient struggles to be born . 



I 

W HEN the first thin snows of 
Winter were being scattered 
by the whips of the wind Thiobud, 
called Rooster, mounted on a 
rough but serviceable pony, made 
his way northeast across the iron- 
hard and frozen mud. He was head- 
ing for the well-guarded burroughs 
of the Scopus Valley, where, he had 
heard, there was an unmanned 
woman. And he hoped to make a 
parley about her. A thin pole rode 
in the leather lancesocket with a 
white strip of rag tied to its top, and 
his pockets were conspicuously 
turned inside out. All this was, of 
course, no proof that he had no 
weapons concealed on or about 
him but it did for ceremony. And if 
anyone did start any trouble and it 
turned out that Rooster had, say, a 
knife hid under his clothes, well, it 
would serve anybody right. A 
gaunt, big-mouthed dog loped 
along more or less beside him. It 
had already run down and ravened 
two snowhares so far today. 

Rooster’s eye-stone began to tin- 
gle on its thong against his skin. 
Someone not too far away was 
looking at him. He let his own 
eyes roam but didn’t turn his head. 
Let them Jook. Even if he were to 
ride buff-bare they could none of 
them see inside his head. The dog 
lifted its horrid muzzle and 
growled and he growled back at it. 
They went on. 

Two men in a turfy peered out of 



the peep-holes. Throwstones 
clinked in their pockets. At the 
first sound of the pony hooves they 
had crawled over to peep out, ex- 
pectant little noises rising in throats 
and mouths. Now one of them be- 
gan to swear. 

“Chip-eating son of a lesbo 
Zon— ” 

“Huh? What? Whuh yuh mean?’’ 
“A whiterag. Cow cunny !’’ 

TTie other squinted through red 
cracked eyelids. The disappoint- 
ment was like a sharp pain. He 
breathed hard. 

He said, “Uh, whuh, we c’ take 
m anyway, uh. Huh?’’ 

“Look how cocky he rides, the 
cow cunny,’’ muttered the first. 
“Elbows out — son of a Zon! Muss 
really think he is a somebody — 
Maybe is — ’’ He turned a scornful 
look on his companion. “We c’ 
take m, uh? We juss bonk m withs 
a bonk stone, easy ’s bonking uh 
chickenbird, uh. And the dog. And 
the pony. Nen what? Naa naa. 
Someone like that muss have pro- 
tection. So juss when we finish eat- 
in’ the pony, down they come, ‘Kilt 
our bruth, didja?’ Nex’ thing ya 
know — well, ya know, doncha? Uh- 
uh. I don’t want no sharpstick ham- 
mered up my sphinc. Nup.’’ 

Already the figures were dwin- 
dling. Too far away for a success- 
ful take. The second man sighed 
and slobbered a little. 

“Besides,’’ he said, “anybody 
with poke enough to go out white- 
ragging, uh, mays got uh witch 



no 



IF 





Ill 





overlookin for m. Person c’ fall 
apart, inch by inch, uh, uuhhh!” 
His filthy body shuddered in a con- 
vulsion not caused by the tempera- 
ture but he made out it was, 
crawled away from the peephole. 
“Gunna throw uh-nuther chip on 
the red-eye,” he muttered. “Gettin 
cunny cold in this cunny turfy.” 
Slowly, either from cold or re- 
luctance, his bruth moved, too. 

“Son of a Zon — see how cocky 
he sat on that Zon cunny ponny?” 
They blew on the small dung fire 
and coughed in the bitter smoke. 
Then they spread out their tattered 
hands to warm. 

W OLF HILL and the level cir- 
cle which was Wolf Hill 
Pond. Strangers Pass. Buffalo 
Head. And then Three Rock 
Brook— nobody, nothing there now 
but a person didn’t tarry without 
good reason. Bow Gaze, also called 
River Bow Gaze, and far down be- 
low the mist made by the smokes 
of the many burroughs. A rich and 
interesting country but not the 
country, not the burroughs for 
which Rooster was heading now. 
And would reach — if he didn’t get 
pulled down by wild dogs or wild 
men or civil men who just might 
have what seemed to them good 
reasons for nOt respecting a white 
rag — if he weren’t gored by a bull 
of some sort, crushed by a deadfall, 
didn’t ride into a stakes-pit, get 
caught in a witch-lace. 

Wolf Hill, Wolf Hill Pond, 



Strangers Pass, Buffalo Head, 
Three Rock Brook, River Bow 
Gaze. So far, so good. No land- 
marks missed. The next one should 
be Poison Bones Flat, a good place 
not to go barefoot and requiring a 
sharp eye and a wide circuit on be- 
half of the pony. And after that — 

He dropped after that from the 
top of his mind and began to think 
about right now, as soon as he saw 
over the next big rise. The dog 
didn’t so much growl as grunt. And 
the pony nickered. Rooster 
counted five other — no — six other 
ponies. He wasn’t able to say just 
how many people but one of them 
was a child. That was a good sign — 
a child. So were the travoys. No 
one went out venturing (a smooth 
word for a rough scene), no one 
went out raiding with children or 
travoys. He didn’t yet know if he 
wanted to company with them — or 
if they’d let him, for that matter — 
even if they were going his way. 
They wouldn’t, couldn’t go very 
fast. Still, never mind, it was time 
to rest a while, they’d built a fire 
and — who knows — he might learn 
something. There — they’d seen 
him. Some were standing up, point- 
ing. 

He raised both his arms and the 
pole. Not increasing his pace in the 
least he guided his mount with his 
knees down the other side of the 
rise. 

It was the child whose voice split 
the cold and the silence with a tiny 
puff of breath. 



112 



IF 




‘^White rag,” the child said. “A 
whiteragger!” 

And, although the grown ones 
must have noted that by then, 
somehow the child’s naming it 
seemed to make the fact certain. 
They did not, to be sure, unstring 
their bows but they lowered them, 
spoke sharply to their dogs. About 
twenty feet away the newcomer 
stopped. For a moment they 
looked at each other. The newcom- 
er saw three men in red-dyed sheep- 
skins, a woman mostly wrapped in 
an enormous mantle of dark wool, 
and the child, whose clothes had 
evidently been made out of the 
scraps of its elders’ clothes. All 
were of dark skin and eyes, with 
here and there a lock of black hair 
hanging loose. And all were still 
unsatisfied. They saw a young man 
in leather, the hood of his jacket al- 
most dovn to his eyes, naturally 
ruddy face nipped still ruddier by 
cold and wind. 

The woman muttered into her 
mantle and one of the men said, 
“Dismount and make your dog 
bide there.” The dog raised a leg 
against a hummock but showed no 
disposition to move closer after be- 
ing bidden. “What do they call 
you?”, the spokesman asked sus- 
piciously. 

“Call me Rooster — though 1 
have a birth-name and a father’s- 
name, too. Tell me, then, can I 
come up?” 

A short hesitation. 

“Come up.” 




ZON

T hey slipped their hands inside 
his clothes, found no weapons. 
Then they touched his hands with 
cold iron, to show if he were a 
witch; and with a silver ring, to see 
if he were a bloodsapper. And then, 
since he neither flinched nor cried 
out nor shrank back, they put a 
pinch of powdered sign-bark on his 
tongue and gave him water and 
watched his throat to be sure he 
swallowed. It was not savory, to be 
sure, but he had swallowed worse 
sign-powder in his life and thanked 
his witch (if he had one) that none 
of any of it had been poison — also 
a hazard of coming up to strangers. 
“All clear, saltmaster?” 

“All clear. Rooster. Sit by the 
fire.” 

“I will sit by the fire . Just a 
bit late for travoys, isn’t it?” He in- 
clined his head towards the wood- 
framed drag-alongs, cargoes lashed 
in place. 

“The mud is all safe-frozen. 
Snow’s not deep enough for sleds. 
We’ll make our winter camp all 
right. Have a hunk of our salt. It’s 
good — well made, clean. And the 
fire was welcome and he, feeling its 
heat on his face, pulled his hood 
back. “Rooster, uh? Well, I see 
why. Never saw a red cresty be- 
fore.” They all gaped — and the 
child jumped and set its hands to 
clapping so that the shell anklets 
rattled and clinked — at the sight of 
his head, polled to the skin, save for 
the roach or comb of red hair rid- 
ing like a crest from brow to nape. 



And then the stocky saltmaster 
spoke a word or two in a low voice, 
and the staring stopped. “Yes, huh, 
good salt— uh — trading’s been 
good, too, this season — huh — ” 

The bulky woman had secured 
her child and now swiveled slowly 
around to face the guest. 

“Why you whiteragging?” she 
asked, in a soft, husky voice. 
“Hunting a loster? Doing a pun- 
ish?” 

The soft comb and curl of wavy 
red hair ruffled as he shook his 
head. 

“I’ve got places to go — I don’t 
want to stop for troubles — Scopus 
Valley is the next place I’m going 
to—” 

The younger of the two other 
men looked at him, teeth showing 
in his lower jaw. 

“Heading for Scopus? Don’t 
want trouble? Why, that’s a Zon 
burrough, Roosty, didn’t you know 
that? That’s the biggest Zon bur- 
rough there is in all round uh these 
parts. You won’t gets through The 
Notch, thems women, thems Zons, 
ull kill y’. Thems’ll cutcher dippus 
off—” 

Rooster shrugged. The saltmas- 
ter shook his head. 

“No, for the white rag. The rule. 
Zons keep to all the rule. Nobody 
keep to all the rule the way Zons 
do—” 

And: “That’s right, Cler — ” 

“True as salt, Cler — ” 

“Never mind trying to scares 
him, Cler — ” the others said. 



114 



IF 




Except the saltmaster, who said, 
“Yes, Cler, maybe you be scare for 
yourself, uh? Suppose we muss go 
to Scopus before to winter camp? 
So, salt, we send you in first, 
Cler—” 

Cler shook his head so vigorous- 
ly that most of his lank black hair 
escaped from under his cap. 

“Not me,” he said, as the others 
laughed (not Rooster, though). “I 
aints a going even near any Zon 
burrough! Send her, send Bets — ” 

“You could carry the white rag, 
you know, Cler,” another man 
said. “Never mind the pole — ^juss 
tie it onto your dippus, Cler — ” 

But Cler, it was clear, white rag 
or not, wasn’t going. 

When the laughter ebbed the 
stout saltmaster said, “Wells, now 
I don’t know. ‘Send Bets . .’ sup- 
pose Bets gets to like it there and 
don’t corne back?” 

More daughter. And Bets gave 
her husband a hearty cuff and 
called him, “Dirty fat man — ” said 
she was too old and, besides, had 
gotten into other bad habits. 

“Seems pretty good habits to 
me,” her husband said serenely. 
Then, more serious, “But we have 
heard, Roosty, that the old Zon 
Ladyking of Scopus burroughs — 
what be her name? — it’s a story 
about that it’s her death-time — or 
was — ” 

“What? Dead?” 

Rooster’s head snapped up. His 
eyes left the embers. He forgot the 
smell from the fat stone caldron 



sitting in their midst. He met the 
eyes of the saltmaster, who, with 
thumb and forefinger, was rubbing 
a fold of his wattled chin. It was not 
Rooster alone who was hoping to 
learn something from this encoun- 
ter — the older man’s black eyes 
were sharp and keen. 

“Dead? I didn’t say ‘dead,’ ” this 
one corrected him. “Not long ago 
at all we’d hears a story it was her 
death-time. Mays be she’s dead, 
mays be she’d gets better, all; may- 
be she’s still the same. Perhap 
you’ll learn the truth before we, for 
we only mays be going there, to 
Scopus-Zon . But you say you 
do go there — ‘the next place — ’ 
uh?” 

Fire or not, it was cold — the 
wind rustled and whimpered in the 
dry snow and blew gusts of it 
against the guest’s naked head. He 
pulled his hood over and used the 
excusable action to avoid his host’s 
eyes. No tentpegs could drive into 
that frozen soil and, had it been the 
saltmakers’ intention to erect one 
of their yurtlike portable huts, they 
would already have at least begun 
it. So — clearly, after eating, they 
would be moving on again. So — 
two questions. Where would they 
be moving? And would he want to 
move with them? 

“Nothing special in the pot,” the 
saltmaster murmured — Rooster 
felt the undiminished tingling of the 
eye-stone — “a something of every- 
thing. No feast. But good. You 
share our fire. So. Share our 
food.”

A long moment passed, so long 
that Rooster, half wondering why 
he had not answered, became aware 
that no one was waiting for his an- 
swer; became totally aware that 
half his attention had for most of 
the long moment been on some- 
thing else. The continual yip-yap of 
the dogs had ceased, the hobbled 
ponies had turned and lifted their 
heads, the clitter-clatter of the 
child’s shells was silent, the wind it- 
self had gone quite dead. And in the 
silence and out of the silence came 
a sound of hooves, not slow, not 
fast — deliberate. Not the hooves of 
a horse or a pony, familiar as the 
sound of human breath, nor the 
wild, shy hooves of deer, the dumpy 
ones of swine. Not elk or moose— 
heavier than bison. Did bison feet 
ever go at that pace? It was the 
combination of unfamiliar sound 
with familiar beat — it was that, yet 
it was something else. A scent, an 
odor, heavy and sharp, filtered 
through the still air. The muscles of 
the dogs moved but no limb stirred. 

They had not been aware, intent 
in their fire-warmed hollow, of a 
gathering mist outside and around 
— and perhaps might not have be- 
come aware of it the very instant of 
their looking and straining towards 
the odd, approaching sound, its di- 
rection at last determined — had not 
at that moment the source of the 
sound itself appeared. Half-ob- 
scured in the mist, on the spine of 
the rise, crossing laterally upon it, 
a figure curiously caped and cowled 



in strange garments. A figure rid- 
ing on a strange beast, a huge 
beast, with great head slung low 
and great horns outspread. A fig- 
ure girt about with unfamiliar or at 
least certainly undistinguishable 
gear and objects. 

The figure moved along in the 
mist, rider and mount — the two 
moved through the mist. And the 
mist moved with the two. 

L ong, long, the Rooster sat by 
the dying fire. Or it seemed 
long. In point of fact it could not, 
he realized, have been, for the fire 
was fed stick by stick and chip by 
chip. The fire was empty, the stone 
pot was gone from it. No doubt the 
stout wife was about to dish out the 
food — it would be welcome. He 
stretched. By salt! How cold and 
stiff he was. 

With a laugh that caught in his 
chest he said as he turned to his 
hosts, “I feel as though I had been 
under a — ” 

Under a spell . 

The words hung unspoken in the 
brittle air. He did not speak them 
because there was no need for him 
to complete the utterance, no one 
to address it to. Twenty feet away 
his pony stood and looked at him 
in silence. 

And they two— and the embers 
in the fire — were the only living 
things remaining there in the hol- 
low at the bottom of the rise. 

All the others were gone. His 
dog, too.

M organ kept making men- 
tion of the cold, the cold. The 
furnaces were heated red-hot, then 
white-hot, and two stout servers 
(where one had done before) 
danced up and down on the box- 
bellows, forcing blasts of hot air 
into the pipes. Sweat in runnels ran 
down their heavy faces and their 
heavy flesh jogged and jounced. 
Others, hurrying by, perspired, too 
— though not as much by far — in 
the unaccustomed heat. Usually, 
at this time of year, the passage- 
ways were tolerable enough with 
only very small fires. 

Two guards, furs slung over their 
arms, limbs and bosoms bare, 
stopped another whom they knew. 
“The king— ” 

“She has asked for fruit — let me 
go — “ ai^;d she sped on by. 

Natural body warmth from all 
those in the vast bedroom would 
have served to warm it — it was sti- 
fling. Anxiety was on every face — 
still, much as those already there 
desired to remain, a sense of fair- 
ness and the rule constrained them 
to depart after a while and let oth- 
ers take their place. The rich and 
glossy furniture, except for one ta- 
ble on each side of the low bed, had 
been stacked against the wall. No 
one knew when Morgan’s hair had 
begun to gray, all knew that she 
dyed it — it framed on all sides in 
huge jetty folds the sunken face on 
the pillows. For moments now the 



face had been still. Someone on 
each side maintained a gentle finger 
on the pulse vein in each withered 
wrist. Some of those watching 
watched no longer steadily the 
sunken, unmoving face — instead, 
their eyes flickered constantly to 
the single finger so gently held to 
each wrist. The room was silent. 
The face grimaced. A single sigh 
filled the room. 

“The hen — the hen — ’’ 

“Yes, Father Mother!’’ 

“ — the hen — the hen — ’’ 

“Yes, Father Mother!’’ 

The cracked, strained voice 
mumbled, muttered, dribbled non- 
sense — it was all the same. She 
spoke. King Morgan spoke. There- 
fore she still lived. 

“Witches — witches — witches — ’’ 
“Yes, Father Mother!’’ 

Hands waved, gestured frantical- 
ly. The witches — in their glistening 
blacks slashed with glistening scar- 
let — surged forward like a black- 
and-scarlet wave. 

The wave ebbed. 

“ — the hen — the hen — ’’ 

“Yes, Father Mother!’’ 

Here and there was weeping. 
Someone cfld enough to remember 
the Zon King when she was not yet 
Zon King but Morgan alone — 
young and vital, full of figure, hav- 
ing many lovers — so someone 
wept. Someone young enough nev- 
er to have remembered Morgan as 
other than the source of strength 
and power and the rule, Morgan, 
King of the Scopus Zons, Father 

117 



ZON 




Mother, sexless strong — so some- 
one wept. 

“ — the hen — the hen — ” 

“Yes, Father Mother!” 

For a moment the old voice gob- 
bled. It fell silent. The fingers 
stayed on the wrists. Then the 
wrists tore away, the withered fig- 
ure sat bolt up in the bed, tore at 
the prime and priceless furs, at the 
butterfly silks. The glossy hair fell 
like a curtain across the seamed 
and riven face, was torn aside by 
the clawlike hands. 

“1 cannot breathe! 1 cannot 
breathe! Fire — fire — I am on fire! 
You’re boiling me alive — alive — ” 

And, indeed, the gray-pale face 
had gone dull-red. Hands gestured, 
waved frantically. Messengers sped 
from the room, fled down the cor- 
ridors, signaled impassionedly to 
the sweating servers atop the huge 
bellows-boxes. The sudden appear- 
ance of the clamoring, gesticulat- 
ing figures below served chiefly to 
throw them out of rhythm. They 
rolled their eyes, could hear noth- 
ing, understood nothing, misun- 
derstood enough to think that this 
relay, as the others, was come to 
urge them to pump more swiftly. 
And so, leaving off the incessant 
jogging from leg to leg, one side 
to the other, the two monstrous 
figures, breasts sweating black 
against coarse dun robes, took 
firm hold of the support bars be- 
fore them and began to jump up 
and down, alternately, to force 
more air and hence more heat — 



— figures began to climb the spi- 
derweb of ladders up to them — 

— voices shouted to rake out 
the furnaces, to douse them down 
with water — 

— shouting the loudest, about to 
risk the fearful heat to alert the 
stokers, was Captain Rack, hot, 
angry, disheveled — 

— laying upon Rack’s arm a 
hand so cool that it commanded 
instant attention was — 
“Memissary! Madame Sir! 
Yes, what—” 

DACK followed back and to the 
®^ide and to, if not precisely 
greater silence, certainly to less 
clamor and noise, the Memissary 
from the Hodus burroughs — tall, 
serene, slender, this one, rumored 
to be in direct line for the kingship 
of her own Zons, the treble-row 
necklace of walrus ivory, insigne 
of her rank, heavy upon her white 
shoulders. 

“Madame Sir, yes?” 

“Captain, with or without the 
steam which your plan must pro- 
duce, ’twill be hours before the 
chamber of the Morgan King can 
cool.” 

This was so obvious that Rack 
could at first but gape. Then she 
bowed. “What does the Memis- 
sary say to do, then?” 

“Obtain a fitting litter and place 
the King upon it and remove her 
to a farther and a cooler place.” 
Again — obvious. Again — un- 
thought of Captain Rack placed 



118 



IF 




her hands upon her breasts, bowed 
twice and, mouth already open for 
further shouting, turned to run 
back. 

But then She of Hodus once 
more placed her cool hand upon 
Rack’s hot arm. 

“To walk means safer speed at 
present. I shall accompany you. 
You will meanwhile be composing 
yourself.’’ 

One after the other the clear, 
crisp truths. Rack was, among 
captains, only one captain. Ac- 
companied by the tall, imposing, 
hieratical figure of the Memissary, 
Rack saw all in that frenzied 
throng make way. And, as she 
composed herself, thus she began 
to think: it was the death-time of 
Morgan Father Mother, Zon King 
of Scopus; did she die today, to- 
morrow, a soonly death must 
come. Tlfcn what? However 
smooth the transference of power, 
things would change, would change 
for all things. Hence — would 
change for Captain Rack. 

Nothing could prevent it. 

She might advance. She might 
stay as she was. She might find 
herself descending into unsought 
obscurity. She might be informed 
(bland words for Exile) that, “The 
roster was to be reduced,’’ handed 
presents, told to return to her na- 
tal burroughs. After twenty years! 
To be flung into the dung-pit of 
the world of men! 

Or . 

Rack had never been so close 



and for so long to the Memissary. 
Each step they took together, de- 
liberate pace more arresting than 
the swiftest race, was a step up the 
stairs of prestige for Captain 
Rack. Not necessary to hint that 
they two had been lovers — best 
(by far) to give no such hint at all. 
Always, some would believe it. 
Might it be true, yet? Rack all but 
trembled. Common sense told her 
that official and urgent business 
only coupled them now and that, 
this business over, they might nev- 
er — probably never — meet again. 
Still — it was not certain. One 
might dream, hope. And more — 
every Zon burrough had its “pri- 
vate people,” its “friends,” its 
“well-disposed” in every other 
Zon burrough. Rack was showing 
the She of Hodus that she could 
compose herself, was dependable. 
Surely, when it came lime to take 
thought of such matters. She of 
Hodus could hardly fail to think 
of Captain Rack. What, after all, 
could be more natural than that 
such a high-groomed Zon would 
want at least one stalwart soldier- 
type for a close companion? 

Indeed, so full was her mind of 
such thoughts that it was with a 
mental stumbling of surprise that 
Rack found the two of them at the 
chamber of Lady King Morgan, 
whose death-time had not yet 
passed. Still the Zon folk ascended 
and descended from all levels to 
have their last audience, still they 
would linger and still their code of 



ZON 



119 




honor made them regularly give 
way for others — for others, were 
they new-fledged Grade One Initi- 
ates or stooped and aging retired 
Captains-at-arms — on the double, 
thus, they made way for Rack and 
the Hodus-Memissary. Fans now 
waved over King Morgan as she 
rolled restlessly on her bed, still 
muttering gibberish, each mutter 
still evoking its respectful chorus.

Ill 

H IS birth-name was Thiobud — 
his father’s-name, Phiniad. He 
remembered his natal burroughs 
little but that little distinctly — 
swarms of children crawling in and 
out of hidey-holes they must have 
been allowed (in contradiction to 
all the safety principles of the rule) 
to grub out for themselves, so 
small were they— noise by day and 
noise by night — often hunger. And 
then one day, riding on his father’s 
shoulders in a place without walls 
and the roof so high he had no 
word for it — his earliest memory 
of the world outside. 

Recollection of the Orth bur- 
rough began abruptly. Instead of 
curling up anywhere on a filthy 



floor one slept in a particular 
place on a clean skin spread on a 
pile of clean hay. It smelled sweet 
— the previous floor had not. Per- 
haps it was saying so to his father 
that brought from Phiniad, not 
given much to words, the com- 
ment: By learning new things we 
learn old ones, too. There were 
fewer children at Orth, far fewer. 
They dug no tunnels of their own. 
They were not suffered to stale or 
ease where they pleased like puppy 
dogs and were fairly frequently 
washed. More than this was not 
exacted of him at first. Later on 
he and several other children of an 
age were taken in one group and 
conducted around the main land- 
marks of the burrough — with the 
customary smack across the be- 
hind to fix each one the more 
firmly upon their minds — from 
the fishponds to the loomrooms 
(as the saying went). He thought 
that Orth was a very fine sort of 
burrough, indeed. And, indeed, he 
still thought so. 

Not long after that Orth under- 
went its first siege during his stay 
there. A mixed rabble of turfies 
(as the homeless, the outlawed, 
the ragged wanderers were called, 
after the sod huts in which they 
lived for lack of burroughs) 
stuffed up the smoke holes in 
hopes of suffocating the inhabi- 
tants. Who, instead of suffering 
themselves to be quietly stifled, re- 
treated to lower levels and thence 
to outside by exits unknown to the 



120 



IF 




turfies and caught the besiegers by 
surprise — and were themselves 
caught by surprise. ' 

Seemingly forever over the up- 
per land at an even space which did 
not vary between them by a hand- 
span and at an even pace which 
hesitated not for fear and in- 
creased not for zeal and which was 
perhaps most terrifying of all (that 
relentless, steady step) came band 
after band of armed Zons. Their 
arrows began their murderous 
songs against the turfies while the 
archers were still well out of 
stones’ throw. The longaxes fin- 
ished the job. Only the turfy wom- 
en were spared — that is, only those 
of the women who had wit or will- 
ingness to tear open their tatters 
and, by baring their breasts, reveal 
both their sex and their preference 
for capture^ver death. 

Not all had been willing. 

The Zons had not, of course, 
come for the purpose of assist- 
ing the Orth folk, just as they had 
not (this time, at any rate) come 
to attack them. They had not even 
been on one of their periodic cam- 
paigns against the turfies. Long 
later he had heard that this group 
of bands had joined with others, 
and then all of them with others 
yet — tales of an army of Zons 
marching westward into the hori- 
zon, of great battles somewhere 
afar off, of witchbirds (buzzards, 
some called them) covering the 
multitudes of dead — dead women 
who had fought more fiercely than 

ZON 



men, preferring always the em- 
brace of death to that of men, the 
caress of bloody black wings to 
the caress of men. 

Always. 

N ot long after that his father 
took him to what (he later re- 
alized) was in effect a Council of 
the Elders. He had already seen 
most of them here and there and 
one by one, white-haired and 
white-bearded men in soft white 
robes — not till then had he seen 
them all together. In part it was 
much as though he were visiting 
any other group of older people — 
they said he was a fine boy, laid 
their hands on his head and wished 
him well, asked him if he liked it 
there more than in his natal bur- 
rough, beamed and chuckled at 
his emphatic Yesl In other part, 
however, he was aware of a dif- 
ference. 

In the Council cell light filtered 
from the light-well through panes 
of translucent shell upon the El- 
ders, some of them so old indeed 
that their very flesh seemed trans- 
lucent. And their thin old hands 
seemed to rest upon his head far 
longer than usual. He was asked 
questions other old people never 
asked him — and some of them 
dealt with things which were, and 
some of them dealt with things 
which were not but might be. And 
what, he was asked, would he do 
in such and such an instance? Or 
under this or that circumstance? 



121 




Finally one of them handed him 
a strip of skin. “Can you read?” 
he asked. 

“Yes, my Elder, I am able to 
read.” 

The boy flipped the skin strip 
over and quickly ran his fingers 
over the tiny bosses and almost at 
once a look of ludicrous outrage 
came over his face. 

He cried out, “This is — this is 
wrong!” 

Several of the old men chuck- 
led. One laughed outright. A few 
smiled. One gazed at the boy in- 
tently and without change of ex- 
pression. And one gazed off as 
though into infinite space, his head 
never ceasing its incessant nod- 
ding, as though in continous 
agreement. 

The particular Elder who had 
given him the strip of skin asked, 
“Why is it wrong?” 

“I don’t know why — I know 
how. Listen, it says, Thiobud the 
son of Panerad the son of Phiniad 
— and so on. But it is my father 
who is Phiniad — ” 

And the old man said, “True 
enough — but this does not make 
the record wrong. It refers to 
Thiobud, who was your father’s 
father and whose father was Pan- 
erad the son of an earlier Phiniad. 
But these things you will learn in 
time. In time you will learn more 
than all of us here together have 
yet learned.” 

The boy’s face, showing surprise 



at first, then keen attention, was 
turned full upon the Elder, whose 
eyes now held his. His red hair 
seemed the sole spot of color in 
that underground chamber, all 
shadows and greys and dim whites. 
His youth was the sole source of 
freshness in the Council cell, 
among the old, old men and their 
collective weariness, the smell of 
dust and age and the ancient fur- 
nishings. 

Demeran, Chief of the Elders 
(he died soon afterward), said, 
“No man’s life can ever be alto- 
gether his own — but yours will and 
must be less your own than is usu- 
ual. Prepare yourself for this. 
When you next see something you 
particularly desire and may have, 
deny yourself it. When you next 
are about to do something you 
particularly desire to do and may 
do, deny yourself the pleasure of 
doing it. Cultivate this habit by 
day and by night, for it will pro- 
vide you with excellent training 
and habits of discipline and self- 
denial, excellent habits for all men 
— but most excellent for you.” 

Demeran said, “You have seen 
the turfies. Their freedom from 
the burrough rule and from the 
need to subordinate and to sub- 
mit they have purchased at the 
price of thirst, nakedness, ani- 
mality, outlawry, incessant hunger 
and early death.” 

Said Demeran, “You have seen 
the Zons. Wealth and military 
power they have obtained but they 



122 



IF 




have obtained it by the sacrifice of 
natural love and natural softness 
and by the carefully and artifici- 
ally cultivated hatred of half of 
humankind.” 

And he said, “You have seen 
life in your natal burroughs, 
whither your father went during a 
time needed to resolve certain per- 
sonal uncertainties — and you will 
have observed and remembered 
that where there is no constraint 
there is* no cleanliness, where there 
is no cleanliness there is no order 
there is no amenity.” 

His thin old voice had grown 
stronger and all his fellow sages 
nodded at his words. There were 
many more words before he 
paused in sheer fatigue and sipped 
at a tiny n^g of milk and water. 
The words seemed to hang in the 
air, heavy as thoughts — the shad- 
ows were gathering in the declin- 
ing day and it seemed to Thiobud 
that the shadows were the old 
man’s words and were heavy with 
heavy thoughts and that they were 
presently to gather around him. 

In another moment he might 
have shuddered or shrunk away, 
perhaps even turned and fled — but 
that other moment never came. 
Someone lit a lamp and he be- 
came aware of the familiar eve- 
ning (also afternoon, also morn- 
ing)cramp of hunger in his belly. 
That the evening meal be post- 
poned in Orth was as unthinkable 
as that any other essential and 



scheduled routine be postponed. 
Therefore the gathering must soon 
terminate — therefore he could en- 
dure waiting until it did. As sure 
enough soon it did. The old one 
still gathering his wool from infi- 
nite distance and nodding, nodding, 
nodding, said (as they bowed and 
were dismissed, father and son). 
“Be sure, Phiniad, he is one.” 

Over the stewbowls the harmless 
halfwit who was permitted to eat 
with the boys said to him, “Ha, 
they got you now.” 

Thiobud said, “What?” 

“They got you now.” 

“What?” 

The man- boy indicated the di- 
rection of the Council cell — then 
all thought of it left his face and 
he slyly stole someone’s chunk of 
bread — something which he did so 
adroitly and with face subsequent- 
ly so innocent and immobile that 
even the victim could not stay an- 
gry at him. 

“What do you mean, they got 
me now?” 

But the other merely dipped his 
crumb and crust into the stew and 
sucked and munched and gave no 
sign of either hearing the question 
or understanding it. 

Eveningdole was good — it was 
food, good food and all boys had 
healthy appetites. They ate with 
good will, talked in good voice to 
each other, laughed, chattered, 
made plans for tomorrow, passed 
bowls for seconds to the table cap- 
tain. And he — Thiobud did the 



ZON 



123 




same. But all the time like a 
wreath revolving and showing the 
same vines and ferns and flowers, 
like a wreath revolving over the 
head of a seated bridewoman, so 
did words seem to revolve as 
though visible and seen, the same 
ones over and over again. 

You will learn more than all of 
us together. Be sure, Phiniad, that 
he is one. They got you now. 

Over and over, around and 
around. Again and again. 

Why would he be learning more 
than all of the Elders together? He 
was one what? Who had got him? 

The meal went on as before, all 
things went on as before, but he 
knew without knowing why that 
nothing was nor would ever be 
again quite as before. And, like a 
wreath upon horsehair threads, 
like a wreath at a wedding-feast, 
the endless chain of words revolved 
and revolved and slowly slowly 
spun around . 

You will learn more than all of 
us Be sure that he is one They got 
you now You will learn more than 
all of us Be sure that he is one 
They got you now 

Around and around and around. 

IV 

H e saw the first of the white- 
limed boulders from a very 
far off. Scopus — or at least early 
sign of it. The sign signified, as all 
well knew, Be exceedingly sure 
that you approach only on what 



we would consider appropriate 
business. All through the whole of 
the next day he passed such rocks 
at regular intervals, passed as well 
fields and pastures, these outer 
ones all empty at this season of the 
year. The night he spent in a clean 
and empty house where, probably, 
herders lodged. It was spotless and 
held stacks of fuel but no food — 
he would scarcely have ventured to 
help himself to any in any case. A 
man coming unbidden iqto Zon 
country — and when was a man 
ever bidden to enter Zon country 
— had to be very careful indeed. 
He looked around to see if there 
were any reading-tapes but there 
were none, not even so much as an 
empty spindle set. Cautious, the 
Zons. 

It was halfway through the next 
morning that he saw the first 
guardpost house, a small triangu- 
lar structure. He had no doubt 
that there were ample burroughs 
beneath — perhaps, even from here, 
underground ways led all the way 
to the main settlement, supplied 
along the way with light and air 
through cunningly hidden shafts: 
indeed, rumor even endowed such 
ways with water in the form of di- 
verted springs. 

Two of the guards were already 
outside. Had they simply sharper 
eyes than he? Had the underground 
rooms served as echo chambers, 
giving warning of his pony’s 
hooves? Or was there some Zon 
magic at work? Having no an- 



124 



IF 




swers, Thiobud merely shrugged, 
glanced to see that the white rag 
was still a-dangle from the pole 
resting its butt end in the lance 
socket and rode on — but before 
he came within arrow range he tied 
the pole to the harness and raised 
both his hands, guiding his mount 
with his knees. 

He had never seen Zons this 
close before. He asked himself; 
apart from the neat and trim lines 
of their winter furs, in exactly 
what way did they differ from oth- 
ers? A wooden gong made from a 
slit and hollowed log hung from a 
tripod and the guard standing by it 
with beater raised was unmistak- 
ably a woman. The one in the 
doorway, whose bow and nocked 
arrow followed him as he ap- 
proached, might have been a boy. 
Any female curves either might 
have had were lost in the conceal- 
ing furs. Friendship on their faces 
would have surprised him; its ab- 
sence did not. Neither was fear 
there, nor alarm, nor hatred — 
chiefly a certain cool caution. But 
besides and beyond any expression 
familiar to him he saw on both 
their faces a common expression 
which was not. He could not as 
yet define it, more than to say in 
his mind that it was strange, that 
they both had it, this look — that 
they were both Zons — and so his 
mind said. It is the Zon look . 
Well. He had heard. Now he saw. 
And if he were careful and if luck 
were with him and if he “had a 



good witch,” he would likely see 
before very long a number of other 
things of which he had until now 
only heard. 

And if he were careless or luck 
were not with him or he “had a 
bad witch” he might find himself 
at the bottom of a very deep and 
very dark pit with several Zon ar- 
rows in between his ribs and at 
least one in his heart. 

T he guards at First Post had 
not precisely welcomed him, 
but he had not expected them to. 
He was the fly and they the spider, 
he entered at his own risk and he 
knew at least in general terms the 
perils of the web. In fact, he 
thought, with a sudden smile 
quirking a corner of his mouth, 
that sounded like a not-bad title 
for a minor epic, to be recited in 
meter to the accompaniment of 
one or two strings and a small 
hand-drum: The Perils of the 
Web ... A gust of wind came 
whistling down the valley, froze 
his grin. He tugged his hood tight- 
er about his face. Greater risks or 
not, he would they had allowed 
him to go by the burrough-ways. 

No — welcomed he had not been 
— but the rule was that a whiterag- 
ger was entitled to pass and, as the 
stocky old saltmaster (where had 
they all vanished to — and how fast 
— and why?) had pointed out, Zons 
kept to the rule. No doubt they 
had helped make it, too. Certainly 
it benefited them as well, being as 

125 



ZON 




they were so far outside the gener- 
al order of things with their man- 
less society, to help create and 
maintain an order above all local 
orders, above even the general or- 
der of things. For it was the rule 
alone and only the rule which en- 
abled them on their periodic 
rounds to ride up, whiteragging, to 
any burrough, to engage in that 
curious spectacle in which their 
well-trained ponies would rhyth- 
mically stamp the ground above 
the burroughs — an unmistakable 
signal — and to proclaim to the 
multitude of never-friendly faces 
that they were there to accept any 
recruits . any prisoners . any 
children for “adoption or educa- 
tion” . any ... so long as they 
were female. 

Never a pleasant scene. Often: 
howls, hoots, jeers. 

But the rule was the rule. 

And sometimes they did not ride 
away unaccompanied. 

Now Thiobud (the son of Phini- 
ad the son of Thiobud son of Pan- 
erad son of Phiniad and so on and 
on) was himself benefiting. The 
guards had not cared for his use 
of the term /reeling — a good thing 
to have realized, a piece of infor- 
mation he would keep in mind and 
pass along for the future — and cer- 
tainly they would have cared even 
less for an unmanned woman, ar- 
chaic phrase in any case and ludi- 
crously inapplicable to one raised 
from childhood by the Zons. So he 
was obliged to explain that what 

126 



he meant, exactly, was: A woman 
who had been raised among the 
Zons from childhood but who had 
not yet taken the Zon-pledge and 
so was hence able to leave if she so 
desired. 

The proper term, he soon 
learned, was “a foster-guest.” 

Callers such as he did not come 
often. That was apparent. But 
something else was apparent, too 
—it was in the air, it was evident 
in certain hesitancies, certain 
glances. And he had no idea what 
it was or even might be. They had 
signaled on ahead by gong-beats, 
which of course conveyed nothing 
to him, and he had been allowed to 
ride on. Several guardposts later it 
had begun to snow and he was be- 
ginning to fear that he might per- 
haps miss his turn-in (or its guards 
miss him) and ride by it — which 
brought up not only the risk of 
freezing to death but the probably 
greater risk of his being shot at 
when he appeared in an area where 
he was not supposed to be . 
small use a white rag against the 
white blinding blanket of the snow. 

But he did not miss it. The 
ground was rising now and he was 
on the lookout. He saw the great 
stone gates and he saw the guard- 
post house and the by now famil- 
iar gong and tripod (house and 
gong and tripod all three much 
larger than those of the outposts) 
— but he saw no one on guard. 

He waited long but the cold 
overcame his caution — or, rather, 

IF 




under those towering crags, of all 
Scopus landmarks the best known, 
and in that snow and wind the cold 
provided a caution of its own. So 
he called out his coming and rode 
up to the post house. 

Lamps had been lit and a brick 
box with a metal door radiated 
heat but no one was within. 

Quite a while he stayed there. 
Then he heard his pony pawing the 
ground. Then the wind changed its 
direction and he realized that the 
noise he had (without especially 
considering it) assumed to be the 
wind was .only in part the wind. 
And was in part — 

What? 

He sighed, shook his head, went 
out, brought his beast under the 
eaves of the house and poured 
grain into tRb small basket for it. 
Then he took up his pole and the 
small bit of cloth to which he 
trusted his life — and he went on 
through the great stone gate. 

T he Upper Entrance to Sco- 
pus burroughs was marked by 
a huge triple arch carved out of 
living rock. The spaces enclosed 
within the outlines of the treble 
curves were crowded with bas-re- 
liefs and statues illustrative of the 
histories of the first three kings 
but statues and reliefs alike were 
clotted with snow. Beneath the 
pediment a vast door for each arch 
had long ago been cut into the 
rock — or, precisely, the lineaments 
of vast doors. The doors were for 



the most part false— rock faces did 
not swing upon rock hinges — but 
the lowermost panels were true 
doors and, as Thiobud came 
trudging through the road, he saw 
these doors were swung open wide. 
The interior blazed with light. A 
huge tent was in process of being 
erected and at least a full thousand 
Zons in every state of dress and 
undress swarmed around. Some 
raced up with poles, others heaved 
upon ropes, some swept from the 
holes socketed in the ground the 
snow that clogged them — others 
kneeled and scooped it out with 
bare hands, snow falling upon their 
bare shoulders. Others, while parts 
of the huge pavilion still sagged 
and billowed, came tottering for- 
ward with rugs and carpets which 
at once were unrolled. Others stag- 
gered beneath the weight of furni- 
ture. He saw at least fifty of them 
bringing in braziers, saw the bra- 
ziers’ red eyes winking and blink- 
ing in the uncertain wind. 

No one seemed to see him at 
all. 

And now another mass seemed 
not so much to exit from the huge 
gaping iliouth of the Upper En- 
trance as to eddy about in it, now 
forward, now slightly backward, 
now slightly to one side, a bit for- 
ward — and, as the last section of 
the huge tent reared upright and 
settled slightly, its rich red and 
purple folds brightening the dark- 
ening day, this new mass of peo- 
ple passed slowly forward and out 

127 



ZON 




of the gates and into the pavilion 
and was hidden from his sight. 

A sight so strange this was that 
Thiobud, observing in open- 
mouthed astonishment, could 
hardly be sure of what was happen- 
ing. But he saw that some, at least, 
of those emergent had been carry- 
ing something upon their shoul- 
ders. He thought it looked like a 
sort of bed— did he also have a 
glimpse of black hair rolling and 
tossing in a brief gust of wind? Of 
a gray face moving from side to 
side? 

The wind of a fierce sudden blew 
back his hood and his hand moved 
automatically to restore it — did 
the gray face (if such it was) turn 
in his direction? Did a tiny hand 
fling itself toward him? Did not 
his eye-stone briefly tingle? 

It had all happened in so brief a 
time that he could be sure of none 
of it. He saw the gold embroidered 
tent flaps sink slowly downward. 
He saw all but one of the doors of 
the Upper Entrance swing shut. 

And stood as alone as before, 
unknowing what to do. 

T he motives of one chosen as 
Zonvizier are notoriously 
mixed. On the one hand there is 
the immediate access to great pow- 
er and prestige via the office of 
Second Servant of the Burroughs 
— the First Servant, of course, be- 
ing the King herself. On the other 
hand there is the instant realiza- 
tion that whoso has ever held the 



office of Second Servant may nev- 
er aspire to hold that of First — 
and, for that matter, may never 
even be certain of continuing to 
hold that of second. 

Zon kings never retire and nev- 
er resign and are never (but never, 
never) deposed. Zonviziers, on the 
other hand, hold office solely by 
the pleasure of the supreme office- 
holder. And this pleasure is often 
such by conventional designation 
alone. In burroughs (not, of 
course, in Scopus burroughs) 
where intrigue rather than indus- 
try, the arts, affections or any oth- 
er emotion or combination of 
emotions holds sway, it is not un- 
known for a potential trouble- 
maker to occupy the Second Seat 
for a very brief time indeed. In the 
morning the would-be disturber of 
the scene is called before the First 
Seat arid handed the symbolic 
Shield of Office — in the evening 
the Zonvizier hands it back to the 
Father Mother King. Who hands 
it back to her. Except that in such 
cases there comes an evening when 
the Father Mother King does not 
hand it back. 

“Go and rest,” says the First 
Servant to the Second. 

And: “Yes, Father Mother — ” 
says the now-without-office. 

To others she says, “Father 
Mother has been pleased to allow 
me to rest.” 

And they reply — if they truly 
are her friends — “How fortunate 
you are. Burdens chafe and heavy 

IF 



128 





129 





burdens usually chafe heavily.” 

Except that sometimes, instead 
of letting their eyes fall or sighing 
sympathetically or offering a love- 
gesture, they say, “Well, that 
didn’t last long, did it? Didn’t I 
tell you that you should (or should 
not) have done thus and so? Ah, 
but no, you would not listen — no, 
not you. Well. Ah!” 

She then knows that these are 
not her true friends and never were 
but of course it is too late. Those 
who hold no power can bestow 
none and so by the brief bestowal 
of glory the possibility of their 
ever holding the greatest of glories 
is forever removed. 

But King Morgan had never felt 
the need to use such tactics — quite 
the opposite. It was said, though 
never of course in the presence of 
a Zonvizier, that Morgan felt it 
would be unwise in the extreme 
ever to appoint to the Second Seat 
anyone who either aspired to the 
First or who was capable of filling 
it. 

“I govern while I live,” was the 
precise way she put it. “And after 
I cease to live 1 shall cease at all to 
govern.” 

In other words, she would take 
no steps to disqualify as her suc- 
cessor any who might otherwise be 
qualified to succeed her. In some 
measure, therefore, the aura of 
the zonviziership was dimmed and 
for over a generation it had been 
held by a succession of nonentities. 
The present occupant was a Cap- 

130 



tain Krug (between the captaincy 
and the viziership there were no ac- 
tive ranks), massive, stolid, more 
than somewhat dim in personality. 
Captain Krug, as captain, had 
gone by the rule and by the direc- 
tion of her superiors. Zonvizier 
Krug, as Zonvizier, did the same. 

Whenever possible. 

At present, however, the Zonvi- 
zier scarcely knew what was possi- 
ble and what was not. A king did 
not die every day and Krug, who 
was in middle-age, scarcely re- 
membered the death of the last 
one. She had certainly not taken 
Zonvows at the time and so had 
been obliged to do nothing but 
weep and follow the prescribed 
mourning. No doubt the rule had 
something to say but the knowl- 
edge of it had dimmed, ebbed, 
since then. No doubt there were a 
few aged Zons about who might 
remember something. 

But not only could the Second 
Servant not ask the First, “What 
must I do in this — the matter of 
your dying?” 

Even if the Morgan King were 
all sharp of mind the Second Ser- 
vant could not have brought her 
tongue to say it. She could not 
bring her tongue to state that it 
was indeed fell death and not ill- 
ness alone that stalked the bur- 
roughs of the Valley of Scopus. 
She had an all but fully formed 
belief that, were she to ask in what 
manner she should act about the 
king’s death or dying the pace of 

IF 




dying might immediately increase. 

Not knowing what to do the 
Zonvizier did nothing or did what- 
ever the loudest voice suggested 
she do — assuming it was not 
against the rule. The face of Cap- 
tain Rack was just a face to the 
zonvizier — but it was the face of a 
captain and, hence, the face of one 
entitled to suggest things in a loud 
voice. The Hodus Memissary was 
in the same category — no, in a 
higher one, for the Zonvizier her- 
self had invested the Madame Sir 
with the customary and honorary 
rank of captain of captains, which 
in theory at least placed her below 
only the Zonvizier. There was 
nothing, to be sure, in the rule or 
any other customary usage about 
erecting the King’s Pavilion in the 
winter — but there had been a few 
occasions when it had been erected 
only because Father Mother Mor- 
gan had felt unwell and not for the 
more usual purposes of ceremony. 

Captain Rack spoke loudly — 
the Memissary smiled her cool and 
enigmatic smile, the Zonvizier — 
half-distracted with grief and con- 
fusion — gave the orders. 

Someone was to be sent for — 
the King had mentioned . 

The King had mentioned! The 
vizier’s middle-aged mind, numbed 
with sorrow and indecision, seized 
upon this single point. It meant 
doing at last something one knew 
that Morgan King had wanted 
done. The zonvizierial fingers were 
snapped. Equerries sprang to the 

ZON 



zonvizierial side. Heads were 
bowed respectfully. 

“Let the Second Seat say — ” 

^ The Second Seat said, “Let the 
young person Tintinna be at once 
brought here — that is, not here — 
we are all going above in order 
that Father Mother escape this 
overheat. The Great Pavilion — es- 
cort her there at once — at once — 
at once — ” 

The Memissary smiled. 

Captain Rack did not. 

T HIOBUD thought that the 
snow-laden winds, grown tired 
of their amorphous writhings, had 
taken on shapes and forms. In a 
moment, though, he realized that 
the forms were those of people. 
They spoke to him, gestured, laid 
their fingers on the sleeves of his 
jacket. Their faces and their eyes 
were red — and somehow he judged 
that this was not from cold. He 
had for some while prior to this 
been not aware of the cold. It was 
the all-encompassing element, it 
had conquered and transformed 
the air, had in fact become the air 
and one usually takes the air for 
granted. Now, suddenly, he was 
again aware of the cold and aware 
of his weariness — he bent his head 
submissively and began to follow 
the shapes. 

But they had stopped. 

For one long second they gazed 
at him. The the nighest one gently 
(it seemed gently) put up her long, 
thin, gauntleted hand and pulled 

131 




down his hood. He had hardly 
been aware it had slipped. And 
then, together, they went at a 
quick pace to the great tent. For a 
brief moment in the waning day 
the flurry of snow halted and a 
thin effusion of the ruddy light of 
sunset made the purple covering 
seem somewhat crimson. Then this 
all vanished. The shadows on the 
snow were blue and the great pa- 
vilion itself turned black. 

Those standing on guard just in- 
side the entrance, furs opened and 
displaying habits of black adorned 
with gold-broidered work, gave 
low exclamations of astonishment 
as the others entered. 

“Then there w^as a person — 
‘outside,’ ” one of them said won- 
deringly. “Just as Father Mother 
said — ” 

“Just as she said. And — ” 

But one of his guides shook her 
head, as though to cut off further 
comment. She placed her hand up- 
on his sleeve and drew him along 
through the throng of turning 
heads and opening mouths, 
through the sudden drop in the 
low-pitched hum of conversation, 
through the deepening silence. In- 
credible, incredible — a swarm of 
people and all of them women! 
And all of them — ah, well — all of 
them had the Zon look. How old 
did they have to be before they 
took the oath or pledge? Nor was 
it that they all looked at him with 
hate, though hate was there — at 
least on some faces — it wasn’t 



even that he was a man, rare 
though men must be in any Zon 
burrough or encampment. It was 
simply the look. 

“Father Mother, here is he.” 

The black hair (dyed, it must be 
dyed), the old, gray, sunken face, 
the incredibly rich coverlets and 
furs, of the woman lying there on 
what in that brief glimpse he had 
believed might be a bed. It was do- 
ing duty as one now, resting at bed 
height off the floor; actually it was 
a sort of litter or palanquin. Had 
she, whoever she was, actually seen 
him there outside as they bore her 
in? The lids fluttered up from the 
sunken eyes, huge and gray and 
glazed, barely focused, barely 
aware of anything any longer. The 
shrunken lips seemed to struggle, 
uncertain as to whether to permit 
or restrain the tongue which at last 
emerged, then retreated. 

What was it she was saying? 

“ — the cockerel, the cocker- 
el—” 

Someone said, “Yes, Father 
Mother!” 

Someone else with a light touch 
took hold of the hood of his jacket 
and pulled it back and down. He 
could feel, as he always felt, the 
roach of red hair rising as it was 
released from the pressure of the 
hood. And he felt — was aware of 
— the throng’s reaction even be- 
fore he heard it gasp. 

“ — the cockerel,” moaned, 
mumbled the very old woman. 
“Yes, Father Mother,” the 

IF 



132 




crowd said, sighed and echoed. 

There was a stir not from the 
far edge of the old woman’s litter 
and a clump or cluster which till 
then had been an undifferentiated 
part of the throng now seemed to 
part from it. Once again he felt 
something for which he could find 
no words, as though (and now he 
seemed to have a clearer image of 
it) as though something soft and 
velvet-webby was moving inside his 
mind, stroking his brain. At once, 
abruptly, it ceased to be pleasant 
— a sensation like vertigo hit him 
hard. Dressed in black robes of 
wide cut, slashed with scarlet, 
black-peaked bonnets from head 
to shoulders and scarlet beneath — 
it might have been ten women, it 
may have been twenty — moved, 
swayed, looked at him, threw up 
their hands in a sinuous gesture 
which seemed to run through them 
like a wave. He pushed back 
against the ugly, dull feeling — it 
vanished. 

Someone in his ear said, very 
low, “The witches — ” 

Now these women set up a keen- 
ing and repeated one sound three 
times. 

“Oh—” 

“Woe—” 

“No—” 

Uneasy was the throng. 

A voice said, “Silence!” 

A voice said, “As Father Moth- 
er wishes.” 

A voice said, “Your beloved 
Morgan King — ” 

ZON 



Not quite had each voice spoken 
together with each other voice. He 
glanced away from the mass of 
witch women while the voices still 
sounded, superimposing their own 
notes upon the other ones. He saw 
the sullen, blocklike face he did 
not know was that of Captain 
Rack. He saw the sturdy and be- 
wildered face he did not know was 
that of the Zonvizier— saw the 
long and gracious and cryptically 
smiling face he did not know was 
that of the Memissary. He saw, 
too, a fourth face, a younger face, 
felt a $tir of something more than 
merely interest. It was not alone 
that this was the youngest face, 
certainly, in all this crowded pavil- 
ion, not alone that it was by no 
means an uncomely face — some- 
thing more stroked softly across 
his mind. 

It was the only face there that 
did not have the Zon-look. And 
the absence of it was as unmistak- 
able as its presence. 

V 

H e had not realized how 
grateful he had been of the 
warmth until once more he was 
out in the cold. Now it was the 
snow and the outside again and al- 
together the wrong time of day — 
night? But another pony was trot- 
ting along beside his and someone 
else sat the second pony. A third 
one with no rider but a deal of 
gear was coming along behind. It 

133 




had all been so easy. It had per- 
haps been too easy. There had 
hardly been a parley at all. He had 
thought of what he would say and 
no one had asked him to say any- 
thing. He had thought there would 
be great hostility toward him and 
it had not been directed toward 
him at all. He had thought to ini- 
tiate a talk about a woman, no 
doubt to return again to continue 
it, to see her, to consider, to re- 
turn perhaps a third time — perhaps 
not to return ever. But it had not 
happened at all like that. And here 
he was, riding through the dark- 
ness and the snow with the woman. 
He corrected his thoughts: With a 
woman. How could he possibly, in 
such a brief course of time, know. 

Something shrilled in his ears. 
Without thinking he flinched away 
from it, found himself hanging 
over his mount’s neck. What in 
witchbane was it? It was she, the 
girl or woman, he scarcely knew — 
it was a whistle she had in her 
mouth, on a lanyard. An odd white 
whistle of a sort he’d never seen 
before and she blew those horrid 
shrills upon it — but why? 

When she had to cover her own 
ears? 

No, she was not muffling her 
ears. She was cupping them, not 
trying to muffle the sound but to 
amplify it. He fell behind her and 
at once realized something as odd 
as all the rest of it — he could see 
her cheeks puffed out as she blew 
upon that devilish little pipe but he 



could no longer hear it. Perhaps it 
had clogged? No — in that instant 
she veered her pony around and 
came abreast of him without ceas- 
ing to blow and the instant they 
drew level he once again heard it 
and he cried out. 

At once she stopped. Stopped 
the whistle, stopped the pony. 

“1 am sorry,” she said. Her 
voice was the same here as it had 
been back there, not that he had 
heard much of what she said, not 
that she had said much— mostly 
farewells and thanks. Certainly 
something of the Zon speech was 
in her voice — but something was in 
it which was not. There seemed a 
faint drawling trace of the speech 
of a burrough he could almost 
identify — unimportant, that, now. 
“But it was necessary. We go this 
way now. Please?” 

He muttered, “Of course — you 
know that we must soon take shel- 
ter?” She nodded. “What is that? 
Zon witch-magic?” 

She seemed to consider how to 
explain it, then said, “I am trying 
to find my bearings here in the 
snow and the dark. The snow dis- 
torts the echoes but 1 think we are 
going the right way now. Do you 
know my name?” she asked. “It is 
Tintinna.” 

“And mine is Thiobud. They 
call me — it is very strange — no, I 
suppose not so very. Well, they 
call me Rooster.” 

“The cockerel,” she said. “Yes, 
it is the same thing, I suppose.

IF 




Mother spoke of that before she 
saw you tonight, did you know 
that? She has been speaking of that 
for a few days now. ‘The cockeral 
and the hen.’ ” 

Mainly he had shelter in mind. 
Vaguely he did not relish the no- 
tion of viewing their relationship 
(whatever it was or was not to be) 
on the simple level of the poultry 
coop. He peered through the form- 
less dark, could see nothing. She 
had blown her mad whistle so that 
she could listen to the echoes. Like 
a bat. 

Abruptly she said, “No, it 
wasn’t that, it’s — oh, a new child is 
always called a ‘chick.’ But it was 
just that I was sort of Mother’s 
pet and she called me her hen — 
that’s all. And,’’ she said, still soft- 
ly, yet firmly, “there was nothing 
of that between us — or any of 
them — or else it’s not likely they’d 
have sent me off so simply, so 
soon. Not that I haven’t been 
ready to go for a while now. But 
you mustn’t take anything for 
granted.’’ 

They were on windswept land 
now. The hooves rang hard and 
loud on the rock-hard ground. 
And the way was up. 

He said, “I did not think — ’’ and 
paused, uncertain of how he 
should word it. 

“If not now, later. It would be 
inevitable — that you at least think 
about it. Zon is Zon, after all. But 
I am not Zon. Still — ’’ and a 
sound in the darkness inade his 



heart warm toward her, for he 
knew that she was laughing there 
in the darkness of the winter night 
— with a stranger. “Still,” she said 
again, “Zon is Zon. Up to the last 
minute. That old Memissary, the 
one in the brown robes with the 
huge ivory necklace — you know, 
she didn’t want me to go. I don’t 
know why — not love, I’m sure of 
that. But poor Rack — she thought 
it was. Oh, her poor face! That 
was why she kept practically 
shouting in the poor old Zonvi- 
zier’s ear. Father Mother wants 
them away — And, well, who 
knows what the poor old thing re- 
ally wants? A prophecy? Rack 
made it out to be one. Still, even 
if Morgan had prophesied your 
coming, <wen if she did foresee our 
being together, who knows that she 
wanted it so? The witches didn’t 
like your reek at all, did they? 
Hold on!” 

There was a scan of ice and the 
ponies slipped and slithered, then 
righted themselves. Then there was 
a wall upon the right, then one up- 
on the left. Then — echo, echo, 
echo — suddenly Tintinna let out a 
whoop and the echoes rolled and 
multiplied and he knew that they 
were inside a burrough. 

A nd still the death-watch con- 
tinued. Extra braziers were 
brought and, swiftly, deftly, blan- 
kets were held up to them to be 
warmed. Deftly, swiftly the ones 
on the Zon King’s bed were rolled

halfway off and fresh ones rolled 
halfway, then all the way. The 
Second Servant snored in her chair 
and most of the former watchers 
had retired to their own cells for 
rest. Some, however, had rolled 
into their furs and lay upon the 
rugs — now and then walking and 
rising and watching, sometimes si- 
lently, sometimes murmuring to 
others, usually returning to the 
rugs for further slumber. 

The Memissary had made some 
concession to her own weariness. 
She sat upon a stool and her heavy 
necklace reposed upon her lap 
where her fingers told the tusks 
over and over again, as though she 
were reading a tape. She faced the 
crouching clusters of witches, a 
sunken, sullen huddle of black and 
red. 

“Great is the strength of the 
Morgan King,” she said. 

After their customary usage 
they answered her in turn. 

“Ah, Mem — her strength is 
great but — ” 

“ — the truth is, although great 
strength — ” 

“ — is in her yet, yet her strength 
is not — ” 

“ — great at all. Ah, nay, Mem, 
for—” 

“ — it is our strength which sus- 
tains it, as — ” 

“ — one sustains a fire by blow- 
ing on it but — ” 

“ — for this fire, Mem, ah, there 
is no — ” 

“ — more fuel, ah — ” 



“Ao — ” They rocked their 
heads. 

“OA — ” They waved their hands. 

^"Woe — ” They sobbed and 
wailed. 

“Nor for much longer — can we 
thus sustain — our Kingly Lady 
dear — it is only that we hope — 
she may yet return her mind — and 
reveal to all — or at least, at least 
—to us, to us— who shall next as- 
cend — ascend, ascend — who shall 
next ascend — the Primest Place — 
the First Seat — but we fear, we 
fear — we fear, we fear — not here 
alone — not here alone — ” They 
chanted and they wailed, swaying 
from side to side, lolling their 
heads and rolling their eyes. 

The upraised hand of the Mem- 
issary was long and slender. She 
lowered two fingers, placed her 
thumb oa one. The chanting 
stopped. With dull and reddened 
eyes they looked at the hand, 
wetted their cracked lips, breathed 
noisily through their nostrils. The 
hand sank once more into the 
Memissary’s lap, once more her 
other hand caressed the sea-morse 
tusks. 

The Mem had no need to raise 
her voice. 

“I know what it is you fear. I 
fear it as well. My own witches 
have warned me — us — that is, the 
wise ones of my own burrough. 
Besides, there have been signs. 
Dreams. Waking warnings — ” 

The witches sighed and the 
witches groaned. They had the 



136 



IF 




witch-puffed lips — they had the 
witch-puffed eyelids, and their 
hands were puffy with witch-puffed 
flesh that gave off the witch-bitter 
reek. Small need then, if identifi- 
cation were desired, for silk- 
smooth black and the inner lining 
of blood-slick red. 

Their faces were turned full on 
the Memissary and all their 
mouths were opened but she 
flinched not at all from the witch- 
stale rancor of their witch-stench 
breath. 

“Wise women, wise ones, sisters 
sage, something trembles in the 
stillness of night, something whis- 
pers in the silence of the stars, 
something very ancient desires not 
to be discerned while it struggles 
to be born anew.” 

“OA — no — woe. What may we 
do?'* 

The delegate bent her long and 
comely neck. The witches slithered 
closer and raised their heads, 
open-mouthed. An observer might 
have thought, had she or he been 
accustomed to think in terms so 
unhuman, that here was a cobra 
feeding frogs. 

“Listen,” she said and her voice 
was cool and her voice was low 
and her eyes glittered and the 
breath hung thin and pale upon 
the thick, stale air. “Listen, my 
lovelies and my loves — ah — lis- 
ten!** 

RESENTLY the quality of 
echo altered and almost at 



that instant the lead pony stopped. 
At once he heard her dismounting 
and then making the little mutter- 
ing noises a woman uses when she 
searches for something, the loca- 
tion of which she feels she knows 
absolutely and which she some- 
how cannot find. A grunt suc- 
ceeded these homey sounds and 
then there appeared in the dark- 
ness a dim glow that spurted into 
a ragged blaze of light against 
which he shielded his eyes. The 
light settled into the symmetrical 
flame of a torch blazing evenly 
where there is no breeze. She was 
holding it out to him and, he hav- 
ing taken it, she reached her hand 
into a kind of press or cabinet 
carved into the wall and took out 
another torch. It blazed up in her 
hand. 

After seconds, during which he 
blinked, he asked, “How did that 
happen? The torch catching fire 
just like that?” 

“It did not really. That’s a pho- 
ton pile. You don’t understand 
me? and if I said stasis, non-stasis, 
sapce, time, energy, matter, tech- 
nology — would you understand 
me? No, not even in Orth. Well, 
so I made it light by Zon witch- 
magic.” 

It seemed that this explanation 
quite satisfied her. It had to do for 
him and, for the moment,^he left 
it so and began to divide his atten- 
tion between his new surroundings 
and his new companion. Here, it 
seemed, was a very old type of 

137 




ZON 




burrough indeed, for the echoes 
had indicated their entrance had 
been by the customary corridors 
and now they were entering what 
was obviously a natural cave or 
cavern. Such types had eventually 
fallen into desuetude; they were 
felt to imply a lack of craftsman- 
ship and sophistication — also, they 
were felt not to feel snug. 

As for the girl — 

He swung about on his seat, the 
torch flaring somewhat from his 
sudden movement. He saw, close 
by the compartment where the 
lights had been stored, a door 
slowly closing. But it was impos- 
sible, both by virtue of the insuf- 
ficient light and its flickering and 
by the distance, for him to say if 
or not it was being closed by 
whom. 

Or what. 

He felt wonder. He was aware 
that he ought to feel fear but was 
by no means certain that he did. 

Things had been calculated 
rather to a nicety in these corri- 
dors, for scarcely had the torches 
begun to flutter and blink and give 
less and less light than they came 
to another place where torches 
were stored; it was well before this 
second issue was exhausted that 
they reached what was evidently 
their destination for the balance of 
the night. She looked up at his 
drawn-out sigh of sheer wonder, 
smiled faintly and dismounted. If 
one could imagine such a thing as 
a vast stone house set squarely up- 

138 



on the top of another such, a third 
upon the second and a fourth and 
fifth and sixth resting upon each 
other, then imagination would 
supply the likeliness of what he 
saw before them. All was made — 
evidently — not by piling stones up- 
on stones but by carving this in- 
credible series of pseudostructures 
from the face of the living rock of 
the cavern. 

It had not been too long since 
others had last visited this place, 
for the bin of broken sweetpods 
from which she filled the ponies’ 
feed baskets smelled merely faint- 
ly musty, the pods were not moldy 
at all. The animals gave two 
somewhat dubious sniffs of in- 
quiry and set to eating. Water for 
them ebbed from a cut in the wall 
into shallow troughs, overflowed 
into a channel which crossed the 
floor and vanished into darkness. 
Tintinna unloaded and unsaddled 
her mount and he, having followed 
her example, helped with the 
pack beast, the torches reposing 
in brackets behind which the soot 
of centuries (and perhaps centuries 
ago) had stained the walls. 

From one of her pouches she 
withdrew a long lanyard of finely 
braided colored leathers on which 
was a single, slender piece of met- 
al. This she dipped into the water 
and then slipped it into the key- 
hole of the door. 

“A curious kind of key,” he 
said, “which has neither any wards 
or any notches — ” 



IF 





139 






All her answer was, “Indeed it 

is. ” 

She found lamps that flicked 
magically into light with a 
smoother and smaller illumination 
than the torches and set them on 
trays and he took one of the trays 
and followed her. Presently a 
series of rooms were illuminated, 
all furnished with everything not 
merely needful but desirable, from 
the mats under the rugs to the 
hangings on the walls, chairs, ta- 
bles, divans, couches, cushions. 
There was food, too, in abun- 
dance, and wines and cordials in 
bottles which sparkled their vari- 
ous colors in the lamplight. 

“The last time I was here,” she 
said, “was with Mother. We ate 
together — here, at this table. 1 set 

it, just as I did tonight. And now 
— strange — I had never heard of 
you until a few hours ago and I 
know nothing about you except 
your name and burrough and de- 
scent — Mother — I suppose — will 
never eat again.” 

They sipped at something dark 
and clear and red that tasted sweet 
and left a crisp, tart aftereffect up- 
on the tongue. 

“Were you fond of her?” 

She considered her glass and his 
question. “I was fond of her,” she 
said. “But not very. Now you — ” 

“What?” 

“That is what I ask. ‘What?’ I 
have never lain with ^ny man and 
I don’t know if I shall with you. I 
don’t know, even, if that’s your 



purpose. Certainly it is not your 
only purpose. You have not made 
the long journey from Orth and at 
this time of year just to get a wo- 
man. And I’m sure you hadn’t 
come with tales of trade and bar- 
ter and tales of tribute and this 
and that just to get a woman who 
had had an education. Orth, I am 
sure, does not lack for learning. 
Nor does Orth need to make al- 
liances on such a basis. It’s well 
you came, you know. I made no 
objection to going.” 

He passed his hand along his 
crest and, holding out his glass, 
“I noticed,” he said. He held the 
glass and squinted through it to- 
ward a lamp. Here was richness 
indeed! Merely a casual meal and 
no great ceremony — fine liqueurs, 
and no candles of smelly tallow, 
softening as they burned but lamps 
that burned magically without 
smoke. 

“A Zon burrough is never at its 
best when the Zon King dies. 
There’s always a question of suc- 
cession and the more one is as- 
sured that ‘here there is no ques- 
tion’ the more one may be certain 
that a question there is or will be 
indeed. And for one such as me, 
partly outsider and partly — well 
— let us say that my position was 
anomalous — ” 

Recollection of those swarm- 
ing, stalwart, grimTaced females 
made him wince. If such was the 
way they were while their king still 
lived he could imagine — rather, he 



140 



IF 




did not care to imagine — what 
they might be like when she was 
dead and a new one not yet on the 
throne. Or, if one prefcrred, on 
the First Seat. And yet it was cer- 
tain that it was only because he 
had come at that time and no oth- 
er that this fortuitous concourse 
of events had taken place. Fortui- 
tous? Or was it that he had a good 
witch? If he had, well, certainly 
she was not among that flock of 
sullen harpies who had moaned 
and crooned their distaste, their 
displeasure and their distrust of 
him. 

“Yes, your position now, I can 
see — would be anomalous. But 
what was your position before?” 

She looked at him steadily and 
thoughtfully. “I think that what 
you mean is, not what was my 
position just before Mother — be- 
fore the Morgan King fell ill, but 
what was it, basically, all along? 
That is, what was the reason for 
my being in the burroughs of the 
Scopus Zon? You do mean — 
Yes. 

“Well,” she sighed faintly, “that 
takes us back to my own mother, 
my blood-mother, I mean — and 
that — I hope you are patient — 
takes us back to my grandfather. 
My maternal grandfather. He was 
a person of some importance 
among the • northern sea-bur- 
roughs. There were intrigues. 
Threats of insurrections, inva- 
sions, oh, the usual ugly scenes. 
And, being a prudent as well as an 



important person, he sent my 
mother — she was only a child — 
over to Scopus with a consider- 
able present. She was to be edu- 
cated but she was under no cir- 
cumstances to be allowed to take 
the Zon-vows until she had volun- 
tarily returned to her natal place 
and lived there one year. If, after 
that time, she voluntarily returned 
to Scopus or went to any other 
Zon place — well, then she could 
do as she pleased. 

“Grandfather evidently acted 
just in time. The whole of the 
northern sea-burroughs went into 
turmoil almost right after that 
and he was killed. Things settled 
down and were still quiet when 
she — when my blood-mother re- 
turned. I have a notion that she 
didn’t intend to stay more than 
that year — but she met my father 
and he was really made to order 
for her purposes in fact, meeting 
him must have shown her what 
her purposes really were.” 

Her purposes were to find the 
way to power, take power, hold 
power. And here was a charming 
and widely popular man on the 
road to legitimate power which he 
did not particularly desire and 
which he was certainly and basic- 
ally too weak to hold for long af- 
ter he had it. He wanted whatever 
attracted him at any moment and 
what attracted him the moment he 
saw the newly arrived and long- 
away young woman was she. Caly- 
mon was his name, Poridel was 



ZON 



141 




hers — the wedding was famous for 
years afterward. Accession to of- 
fice followed not long after. Caly- 
mon soon tired of it but Poridel 
did not. Therefore Calymon con- 
tinued to hold office and, through 
him, so did Poridel. 

“He hadn’t really known how 
you stayed in office,” his daughter 
said. “He thought it was done the 
same way you entered office. He 
thought it was because the people 
liked you and he thought they 
liked you because you were lik- 
able. But she knew better. You 
can’t imagine how useful the Zon 
training had been for her. She 
spun webs of intrigue around the 
other intriguers while they were 
still laboriously spinning single 
threads. There wasn’t anything she 
wouldn’t do — in fact, there was 
scarcely anything she didn’t do. 
And he found out. And it killed 
him.” 

The final blow was the discovery 
of his wife’s connection with Arte- 
man, a younger and more vigor- 
ous version of himself And, while 
Calymon lay with his face turned 
to the wall of his chamber, Arte- 
man was inducted as his succes- 
sor. Then Calymon covered his 
face, and died. Difficulties? Not 
because of that — but difficulties 
certainly. Certainly Poridel wanted 
power, but she wanted other things 
as well. Arteman, for example. 
Arteman was much like Calymon, 
but Tintinna was Calymon’s 
daughter — she was not Arteman’s. 



“I was thirteen. She found us 
together. He was holding me 
around the waist and I was hitting 
him and he was laughing. Oh, 
witches! Her face — ” 

Thiobud said, “And so she did 
the same thing her father had 
done. Sent you to Scopus. To pro- 
tect you.” 

The quiet mask of her face van- 
ished. “To protect me?” she cried, 
incredulous. “She would have 
dropped me over a cliff if it could 
have been done without notice. 
But, as it couldn’t, she sent me to 
Scopus. And there 1 was. It’s been 
five years.” 

“But I don’t see — I mean, sure- 
ly if you were to return now, after 
five years, wouldn’t he — that is — ” 

A faint smile twisted its way 
across her face and was in a mo- 
ment gone. “You mean, she will 
be five years less desirable and 1 
will be five years more? Don’t 
think she wasn’t able to see that. 
But her hope was that I would, if 
you follow me, get so Zon that 
even if I returned and even if Arte- 
man played at me again I’d re- 
pulse him, not from fright as be- 
fore, but as I’d. repulse any man. 
So she hoped. 

“Nice, isn’t it?” 

He grimaced and then, as she 
got up and reached for a lamp, 
resolution, if not conviction, 
snapped up his head. She stood 
very still, her fingers just touching 
the lamp, having caught the slight 
movement. She looked at him in- 



142 



IF 




tently and without expression. 

“Neither do I know,” he said, 
“if your old Mother King was a 
true prophet. And may never 
know. But 1 need not see every 
spoke to surmise a wheel. Listen, 
Tintinna, I had come to Zon to 
make a parley about you, al- 
though I didn’t know that you 
were you. I feel now, indeed, that 
you are woman enough for any 
man, as I do feel myself man 
enough for any woman. But there 
is far more than that and this more 



either affects us both together or 
not at all and never. Will you re- 
solve now to come with me, un- 
harmed and unpressed, to Orth 
Burrough, and there hear and lis- 
ten and there decide?” 

She handed him the lamp. He 
took it with one hand and took 
her hand with the other and he 
blew out the lamp. She took shel- 
ter in his cloak. She laughed. She 
kissed him. And, trusting, with a 
stranger, slept. Thiobud, dream- 
ing, brought her safely home. • 



TROUBLESHOOTER 

“What’s odd?” 

“I remember these bearings. 1 
punched them on the keyboard 
myself yesterday. I saw a dust- 
cloud on the viewscreen — too thin 
to register on the radar but I 
thought it advisable to avoid it as 
it may have contained particles of 
sufficient size to puncture the hull. 
You can’t be too careful with 
clouds. It was just before your 
watch and I thought you might not 
appreciate the danger.” 

Or you might, DeGrazza, have 
plunged straight into the cloud, 
daring with deathwish and heedless 
for the life on an alien who, to 
you, is one step from the ape, al- 
though pervertedly telepathic. And 

TROUBLESHOOTER 



(Continued from page 37) 

the alien wishes to live because 
that is the way of his kind, as it 
should be the way of yours. But 
you must hurry to death because it 
will be so pleasant then not to have 
to hurry . 

“You didn’t instruct the brain 
telepathically?” 

“The brain is only for use when 
the computer breaks down,” re- 
plied the alien stiffly. “Although 
the brain would know of the bear- 
ings because it checks all keyboard 
information.” 

“So something threw the brain 
back in time.” DeGrazza ponder- 
ed. “I wonder — wait a moment. 
You fed in these bearings just be- 
fore your sleep period?” 

143 





“That’s right.” 

Suddenly the whole scene of the 
near-disaster flashed back through 
DeGrazza’s mind — the asteroid 
sliding into the viewscreen, his own 
sense of danger, his fingers poised 
over the controls, the asteroid 
growing, the mountains becoming 
clear and huge, the alien dozing be- 
side him, his eyelids fluttering, 
fluttering . 

And the sudden veering plunge 
into danger. 

“That’s it!” gasped DeGrazza. 

“rpHEY call them REM’s,” he 
-I explained to the alien. The 
rapid eye movements visible 
through the lids which signify that 
a sleeper is dreaming. You were 
dreaming just before the ship went 
out of control — I saw you. You 
were also asleep the first time we 
lost control, two days ago, al- 
though you woke up and brought 
the ship around.” 

“I don’t see the connection.” 

“I’ll tell you. In the mid-twen- 
tieth century an Earth doctor 
made an analogy between the brain 
and the computer suggesting that 
the purpose of sleep was to dream. 
Dreaming in effect cleared the 
mind of extraneous, accumulated 
dross, just as you clear a compu- 
ter before reprograming. He car- 
ried out tests with people and com- 
puters, depriving them of dreams 
and clearing respectively. Both 
men and machines showed similar 



resultant hallucinatory behavior 
patterns.” 

“I’ve heard that theory.” 

“You see the implication? 
You’re a pilot, you love your job, 
you shuttle to and fro between Al- 
tair Six and Eight all the time. 
Navigation is part of your job, 
you love it. You live by the com- 
pass, eat by the compass. You 
read bearings, you punch bearings, 
you sleep bearings. 

“You dream bearings . 

“And the brain will pick up a 
projected, telepathic dream of a 
series of bearings and assume that 
it is a direct instruction and act ac- 
cordingly, as it has been taught, 
overruling the computer, radar, 
common sense and everything else. 
Not realizing, because it can’t, 
that your mind is clearing itself in 
sleep.” 

There was a long, thoughtful si- 
lence. The viewscreen was empty- 
ing now, the larger asteroids drift- 
ing behind; just the thin sprinkling 
of twinkling dots left, through 
which the computer eased the ship 
with unerring precision. And be- 
yond the dust, the point of light 
that was Altair VIII was swelling 
into a glowing disc. DeGrazza re- 
laxed in his seat, contemplating a 
long stay on the destination planet 
before returning home. He reckon- 
ed he’d earned it. 

You were right, DeGrazza. The 
solution to the problem is in the 
Altairid mind. And now you can

go home to Mary and Cobb and 
the future because you know that 
they will want you back quickly 
for your earnings and your intelli- 
gence, if not for yourself Forget 
that long hdliday — there*s no point 
in thinking about it because you 
know you will not stay here. You 
must hurry forward again, con- 
suming the future as it comes be- 
cause that is your true way, con- 
sume avidly and avoid skillfully, 
wherever you sense it, the strych- 
nine of death. Until, one day, the 
promise of the pill is too sweet . 
But not this time. Next? 

At last the alien spoke. “I fear 
there is much in what you say. I 
will go so far as to say that, in my 
opinion, you are right. I, too, have 
read with interest the writings of 
your Evans school of thought on 
dreams, yet the solution did not 
occur to me. It is sad to think 
that, in our efforts to make inter- 
planetary travel safer, we have 
achieved the opposite. What are 
your suggestions?” 

“As I said before, the compu- 
ters have never failed yet. You’ll 



have to remove the brains.” 

“True,” sighed the Altairid. 
“We cannot prevent ourselves 
from dreaming.” 

True indeed, thought DeGrazza 
with an inward clutch of premoni- 
tion. As the ship sped on the final 
day of its journey to Altair VIII 
he wondered what the next night 
would contain and whether his 
dream fireball would be replaced 
by jagged asteroid peaks and black 
ravines, hurtling towards him at 
colossal speed. 

If only it were as simple as, say, 
pressing a button to clear a com- 
puter. 

Goodbye, DeGrazza of the tor- 
tured mind and plunging compul- 
sions. We cannot feel superiority, 
only sympathy — because on this 
occasion you have taught us; yet 
there is so much we could teach 
you, if you would let us. But you 
are so immersed in self-pity that 
you are hardly aware of those 
about you — Mary, Cobb and — the 
Altairid. 

DeGrazza and Earth, I thank 
you on behalf of Altair. And you 
don't even know my name ... •

“In that case^they — or it — “ 

“He,” Retief amended. 

“TT E’S overheard every word 
H that’s been spoken since we 
landed.” Magnan addressed the 
blossoms directly. “Look here, 
Herby — you’re aware that we’re 
distressed diplomats, marooned 
here by an unfortunate acci- 
dent — ” 

“1 thought Slith and that other 
fellow — Okkyokk — were responsi- 
ble,’’ Herby corrected. “They 
seem dreadfully argumentive 
chaps. I do wish they’d lower their 
voices.” 

“Quite — now, you’re aware of 
their hostile intentions toward Mr. 
Retief and myself — ” 

“Oh, my,” Herby interrupted, 
“they do seem upset. Such lan- 
guage—” 

“Yes. As I was saying — ” Mag- 
nan paused. “What do you mean, 
‘such language?’ ” 

“I was referring to Grand Com- 
mander Slith’s rather graphic use 
of invective,” Herby explained. 
“Not that General Okkyokk isn’t 
holding his own, of course. I must 
say my vocabulary is expanding 
rapidly.” 

“You speak as though you 
could hear them now.” 

“I can. On the ship-to-shore 
band.” 

“But — you don’t have a radio — 
do you?” 



“A what?” 

“If he has organs for detecting 
sound,” Retief said, “why not or- 
gans for picking up short wave?” . 

“Why — that’s remarkable,’’ 
Magnan exclaimed. “But short 
wave? It would be rather too 
much to hope that you can send as 
well as receive?” 

“Why, I suppose I could trans- 
mit via my snarfnodes — if there 
were any reason to.” 

“Retief— we^ re saved! Herby — 
send the following message at 
once: Special Priority-Z Mayday, 
CDT Sector HQ, Aldo Cerise. 
CDT eight-seven-nine-oh-three, 
subject unprovoked attack — no, 
make that unwarranted attack — 
resulting in emergency planetfall 
and — ” 

“Oh, I’m^sorry, Mister,” Herby 
cut in. “I couldn’t send that.” 

“Why not?” 

“Why, if I did, some nose park- 
er might come and take you 
away.” 

“1 sincerely hope so.” 

“I’ve waited two hundred stan- 
dard years for someone to talk 
to,” Herby said in a hurt tone. 
“Now you’re talking of rushing 
off. Well, I won’t have it.” 

“The SOS is our sole hope,” 
Magnan cried. “Would you stand 
in the way of our rescue?” 

“Please calm yourself. Mister. 
Look at Retief. He’s not making

a scene. Just resign yourself to the 
fact that you’ll spend the rest of 
your life here and we’ll get on fa- 
mously — ^just as Renfrew and I 
did right up until the last few 
days.” 

“The rest of our lives?” Mag- 
nan gasped. “But that’s unthink- 
able. We may linger on for anoth- 
er fifty years.” 

“Not if Slith has his way,” Re- 
tief said. “Where are they now, 
Herby?” 

“1 was about to say,” Herby be- 
gan. “They’ll be arriving any — ” 

T he vegetable voice was 
drowned by a rising drone that 
swelled swiftly to a bellowing roar. 
A sleek, shark-nosed shape swept 
overhead, followed by another, 
two more, then an entire squad- 
ron. Sonic booms crashed across 
the jungle, laying patterns of 
shock ripples across the still water 
of the lake. Treetops whipped in 
the turbulent wakes as two battle 
fleets hurtled past at low altitude, 
dwindled, were gone. 

“You see?” Herby said a trifle 
breathlessly into the echoing si- 
lence. “Two’s company but a 
crowd is altogether too much.” 
Retief twisted the knob of the 
radio slung at his belt. 

“. pinpointed our quarry!” 
Slith’s breath voice was keening. 
“If you will employ your units in 
encircling the south shore of the 
island. General, I shall close the 
pincer to the north.”

“Looks like they’ve spotted 
us,” Retief said. “Slith must car- 
ry better optical and IR gear than 
I gave him credit for.” 

Sunlight winked on distant craft 
circling back to spread out on the 
far side of the lake, sinking down 
out of sight behind the massed fo- 
liage of the forest. Other vessels 
were visible to left and right. 

“Not much point in running 
cross-country,” Retief said 
thoughtfully. “They’ve got us sur- 
rounded.” 

“What are we going to do?” 
Magnan yelped. “We can’t just 
stand here.” 

“Ouch!” Herby said suddenly. 
“Ooh! Ahh!” 

“What’s the matter?” Magnan 
leaped in alarm, staring around 
him. 

“Why that hurts like any- 
thing!” Herby exclaimed indig- 
nantly. 

“It’s the landing blasts.” Retief 
indicated the smoke rising from 
points all around the compass. 
“The Groaci still use old-style re- 
action motors for atmospheric 
manuvering. Must be scorching 
Herby quite painfully.” 

“You see what sort of uncouth 
ruffians they are?” Magnan said 
indignantly. “Now wouldn’t you 
like to change your mind, Herby, 
and assist us?” 

“And collect a new crop of 
third-degree burns when your 
friends arrive? No, thank you. It’s 
out of the question.”

A deep-toned whickering sound 
had started up, grew quickly loud- 
er. 

“A heli,” Retief said. “They’re 
not wasting any time.” 

In the shelter of the tree the two 
Terrans watched the approach of 
the small, speedy craft. It swung 
out over the lake, riffling the wa- 
ter, and hovered two hundred feet 
in the air. 

“Attention, Terran spies!” an 
electronically amplified voice 
boomed out from it. “Surrender 
at once or suffer a fate unspeak- 
able—” 

“Herby — if those barbarians get 
their hands on us our usefulness 
as conversationalists will come to 
an abrupt end,” Magnan said ur- 
gently. 

“You have been warned,” the 
PA blared. “Emerge at once emp- 
ty-handed — ” 

“Maybe we can hide out in this 
dense growth,” Magnan said, “if 
Herby will keep us apprised of 
their wherabouts. Maybe we can 
elude capture until help comes.” 

The copter had drifted closer. 

“Thirty seconds,” the big voice 
boomed. “If at the end of that 
time you have not submitted to 
Groaci justice the entire island 
will be engulfed in fire — ” 

“Cook us alive?” Magnan 
gasped. “They wouldn’t — ” 

“Retief — Mister,” Herby said 
worriedly. “Did he mean what he 
seemed to mean?” . 

“I’m afraid so, Herby,” Retief 



said. “But don’t worry. We won’t 
let matters proceed that far. Shall 
we go, Mr. Magnan?” 

Magnan swallowed with diffi- 
culty. “I suppose a comfortable 
garroting in a civilized cell is pref- 
erable to broiling alive,” he said in 
a choked voice as they walked out 
from the shade into the bright 
orange sunlight of the beach.

“A WISE decision. Soft Ones,” 
A^Slith whispered. “In return 
for your cooperation I give my re- 
assurances that your remains will 
be transmitted to your loved ones 
suitably packaged, with a friendly 
note explaining that you fell foul 
of the alert Groacian anti-spy ap- 
paratus and were dispatched ere 
my personal intervention could 
save you from the just retribution 
your crimes deserved.” 

“Why, that’s very thoughtful of 
you. I’m sure. Grand Command- 
er,” Magnan said, mustering a 
ghastly smilf. “But might I sug- 
gest just one little change? Why 
not intervene just a bit sooner and 
return us safe and sound — a stir- 
ring gesture of inter-being amity.” 
“My researches into the Ter- 
ran nature,” Slith interrupted, 
steepling his eyes — an effect which 
failed to reassure his listeners — 
“indicate that your kith respond 
most generously to those who 
adhere to a policy of unswerving 
hostility. This evidence of Groaci

determination will evoke, I doubt 
not, a sizable increase in the Ter- 
ran subsidy to the Keep Groac 
Gray drive — funds which will of 
course be quietly diverted to our 
urgently needed naval moderniza- 
tion program.” 

“But why?” Magnan clanked 
his chains disconsolately. “Why 
can’t we all just be friends?” 

“Alas,” Slith said. “Aside from 
the fact that we Groaci find you 
Soft Ones singularly repellent to 
all nine senses, rendering social in- 
tercourse awkward — and the fur- 
ther fact that Terran ambitions 
conflict with manifest Groaci des- 
tiny — plus the fact that I owe you 
suitable recompense for your ma- 
licious sabotage of my mercantile 
efforts at Haunch Two — aside 
from these matters, I say — it’s 
necessary at this juncture to si- 
lence you.” 

“Silence us?” Magnan said. 
“Why, heavens. Commander Slith 
— if you’re referring to the little 
misunderstanding that led to our 
unscheduled landing here on Yu- 
dore, don’t give it a thought. Why, 
I’ve already forgotten it. Actually, 
it was probably just pilot error on 
the part of my colleague, Mr. Re- 
tief— ” 

“He’s not talking about that, 
Mr. Magnan,” Retief ^aid. “He’s 
talking about his use of Yudore 
as a red herring to cover an attack 
on the Slox Empire.” 

“Silence, verbose one,” Slith 
said but Okkyokk, whose image 

THE PIECEAAAKERS 



on the conference screen had been 
quietly occupying a complicated 
perch in the background, spoke 
up. 

“Who this? My fascinate! 
Gosh! Tell more!” 

“Fool.” Slith leaped to his feet, 
vibrating his throat sac at Retief. 
“Your groundless insinuations de- 
prive you of iTfe’s last sweet mo- 
ments.” He signaled the guards. 
“On with the executions.” 

“Not so hurry. Five-eyes!” Ok- 
kyokk snarled. “Conversation me, 
Terry; my interest, oh, yes! Tell 
on!” 

“Keep out of this, Okkyokk!” 
Slith snapped as the guards started 
forward eagerly. 

“My listen!” Okkyokk yelled. 
“Your forgot, Slith — I guns train 
on you! My chat there Terry — 
blow your in fragmentation, or!” 
“Better humor him, Slith,” Re- 
tief said. “Inasmuch as your fleet 
consists of disguised barges with 
dummy guns, you’re in no posi- 
tion to call his bluff.” 

Slith made spluttering sounds. 
“No gun?” Okkyokk chortled. 
“Good new tonight! Tell Terry!” 

“Tt’s quite simple,” Retief said. 

-■.“Slith lured you out here to 
get your gunboats out of the way 
so he could proceed to attack the 
Slox home planets with minimal 
interference. The bombardment is 
probably underway right now.” 
“Lies!” Slith found his frail 
voice. “Okkyokk — he seeks to set 



149 




US at odds, each with the other!” 

“I grateful you extreme, Ter- 
ry!” the Slox commander grated 
in a voice like a steel girder shear- 
ing, ignoring Slith’s appeal. “Pre- 
paration you for dead, Groaci big- 
shot! Fake up big war, eh, you 
tell. Make fool allbody, eh? Then 
join force and invasion Terries, 
eh? Fruits and nuts! You never de- 
lusion me for every! Hold on hats, 
kids—” 

“Don’t fire. The Soft One lies 
— as I can prove in most dramatic 
fashion — by blasting your cancer- 
ous aggreation of derelicts into 
their component atoms — ” 

“Retief— say something,” Mag- 
nan yelped. “If they shoot — ” 

“Then you Soft Ones will die!” 
Slith piped. “If they prevail you 
die with my flagship — and if I pre- 
vail — then long shall you linger 
under the knives of my virtuosi!” 

“How you plan do so big shoot 
with empty gun?” Okkyokk in- 
quired warily. 

“Retief!” Slith cried. “Confess 
to him you lied — else will I decree 
torments yet uninvented to adorn 
your passing!” 

“Better open fire quickly — if 
you can,” Retief said. “As for 
you. General,” he addressed the 
screen, “it always pays to get in 
the first lick.” 

“Retief, what are you saying?” 
Magnan yelped. “Why goad them 
to this madness? No matter who 
wins, we lose!” 

“My confuse!” Okkyokk stat- 



ed. “Splendor idea, shoot up un- 
armed Five Eyes — but what if 
Terry big lying?” 

“Don’t let him get the jump on 
you, Slith,” Retief advised. 

“Gunnery Officer!” the Groaci 
commander piped in sudden, ag- 
onized decision. “All batteries — 
open fire.” 

The response was instantane- 
ous. A series of hollow clicking 
wounds came over the intercom. 
They were followed by the dum- 
founded voice of the Gunnery of- 
ficer. 

“Exalted one — I regret to re- 
port—” 

“Sabotage,” Slith yelled. 

On the screen Okkyokk paused, 
one digital member poised above 
a large puce button. 

“How, no explosing? Gun fails 
operationing, just as Terry in- 
form? Splendor!” the Slox leader 
waggled his ocular exterm- 
“Now time proceedure to exterm- 
ination you with leisurely! Mas- 
ter Gunner — procedure blow pic- 
ture window in Five Eyes flagship, 
give Commander Slith good view- 
ing of eventuals!” 

Slith hissed and sprang for the 
door, where he fought for position 
with the guards who had reached 
the portal before him. Magnan 
covered his ears and screwed his 
eyes shut. 

“Whats?” Okkyokk’s puzzled 
voice was coming from the screen. 
“Hows? Malfunctionate of fire- 
power at times like these? My in-

tolerate! Caramba! Oh, heck!” 
“I suggest both you gentlemen 
relax.” Retief raised his voice 
slightly over the hubbub. “No 
one’s going to do any shooting.” 
“So — your spies have infiltrated 
my flagship,” Slith said. “Little 
will it avail you, Retief. Once in 
space, my most creative efforts 
will be lavished on your quivering 
corpori.” He scrabbled on the rug, 
came up with his command mike. 
“Engineer — lift off, emergency 
crash procedures.” 

“Another disappoihtment in 
store. I’m afraid, Slith,” Retief 
said as no surge of acceleration 
followed. “Herby’s particularly 
sensitive to rocket blasts,” he ex- 
plained gently. “Ergo — no gun- 
fire.” 

“Herby?” Slith keened, wag- 
gling his eyes from which the 
jeweled shields had fallen in the 
tussle. “Herby?” 

“Herby,” Okkyokk muttered. 
“What Herby, which?” 

“Herby,” Magnan gasped. “But 
— but — ” 

“Undone?” Slith whispered. 
“Trapped here by the treachery of 
the insidious Soft Ones? But brief- 
ly shall you gloat, my Retief.” 

The Groaci jerked an elaborate- 
ly ornamented gun from the plas- 
tic holster at his bony hip, took 
aim. 

“Three and out,” Retief said as 
Slith stared in goggle-eyed paral- 
ysis at the small coral-toned flow- 
er growing from the barrel of the 

THE PIECEAAAKERS 



weapon. “Herby appreciates my 
conversation far too much to let 
you blow holes in me. Right, 
Herby?” 

“Quite so, Retief,” a cricket- 
sized voice chirped from the dainty 
blossom. 

“My departure, golly whiz!” 
Okkyokk’s voice blasted from the 
screen. “Navigationer — full fast 
ahead!” 

“No use. General,” Retief said. 
“Everybody’s grounded. Your 
field windings are full of vines. I’m 
afraid.” 

“So that’s why Renfrew 
couldn’t leave.” Magnan gulped. 
“I knew it all along, of course.” 

“What does this mean?” Slith 
whispered. 

“It means you’ve been con- 
quered single-handed by a popula- 
tion of one,” Retief addressed the 
alien leaders. “So — if you’re 
ready, gentlemen. I’m sure Herby 
will be willing to discuss the terms 
of your surrender.” 

“PWEAVENS’ Retief,” Morgan 
JTlsaid, adjusting the overlap- 
ping puce lapels of his top formal 
mid-morning cutaway in the gilt- 
framed mirror outside the impres- 
sive mahogany doors of the un- 
dersecretary for extraterrestrial 
affairs. “If we hadn’t seized a mo- 
ment to transmit a distress call on 
Slith’s TX while Herby was busy 
taking the surrender, we might 
still be languishing in boredom on 
that dismal island.” 



151 




“I doubt if we’d have been 
bored,” Relief pointed out. “With 
several hundred grounded sailors 
roaming the woods and blaming 
us for their troubles.” 

“What a ghastly experience, 
with every bush and bough jabber- 
ing away in colloquial Slox and 
accentless Groaci, carrying on 
twelve hundred scrambled conver- 
sations at once!” 

“In time I think Herby would 
have mastered the knack of seg- 
regating his dialogues,” Relief 
said. “Even with a slice missing 
from that four-mile brain the 
soundings showed he should be a 
fast learner.” 

“He certainly mastered the 
technique of creative negotiation 
with record speed,’’ Magnan 
agreed. “I can’t help feeling a tri- 
fle sorry for poor Slith and Ok- 
kyokk — their fleets consigned to 
moulder on the ground, the while 
they supply teams of conversa- 
tionalists in relays in perpetuity 
to entertain their conqueror.” 

Relief and Magnan turned as 
the elevator doors opened behind 
them. An orderly emerged, push- 
ing a tea cart on which rested a 
handsome teak tub containing a 
tall, lily-like plant topped by a six- 
inch flower, glowing a healthy 
pink and yellow. 

“Ah, gentlemen,” the blossom 
greeted them in a mellow tenor 
voice. “I’m happy to report that 
new scenes seem to stimulate me 
— or at least this slice of me.” 



Magnan shuddered delicately. 

“Imagine sprouting a bureau- 
crat from a wedge of frontal 
lobe,” he said behind his hand. “It 
makes my head ache just to think 
of it. 

A slender man with thick spec- 
tacles thrust his head from the 
secretarial suite. 

“The secretary will see you 
now,” he announced and held the 
door as the orderly wheeled the 
cart through. 

“Mr. Secretary,” Magnan said 
grandly, “I have the honor to pre- 
sent his excellency the Herbaceous 
Ambassador.” 

“Delighted to meet you, sir or 
madam,” Thunderstroke rumbled, 
inclining his head graciously to the 
bloom, which nodded in reply. 
“Now — do tell me all the details 
of how you captured two fully 
armed war fleets — ” 

Relief and Magnan withdrew, 
leaving the undersecretary listen- 
ing attentively to his visitor’s ac- 
count of the sapless victory. 

“Lobotomy seems to agree with 
Herby,” Magnan observed com- 
placently. “Well, I must hurry 
along. Relief. I have a modest 
cutting I plan to infiltrate into the 
flower bed under the Groaci am- 
bassador’s window.” He hurried 
off. 

“Tsk,” said a tiny voice from 
the pink buttoniere adorning Re- 
liefs topmost lapel. “The segment 
of me you left with the undersec- 
retary is being regaled with a rath- 

IF 



152 




er gamy anecdote about cross- 
fertilizing tea-rose begonias. The 
punch line is — ” 

“It’s not considered polite to 
listen in on private conversations, 
Herby,” Retief pointed out. 

“How can I help it?’’ the blos- 



som protested. “After all, it’s me 
he’s talking to.” 

“Just don’t repeat what you 
hear. Unless,” Retief added as he 
strolled off toward the chancery 
bar, “it’s something you think I 
really ought to know.” • 



READING ROOM 

All this is very well for a story 
of trickery and intrigue on a rath- 
er routine plotting level. But it has 
led us rather far from the early 
world that all the sections were 
emphasizing in the beginning. And 
the more we get away from that 
world of overcrowded and mad 
North America, the less use there 
is for the complex mechanism 
used to tell the story. Toward the 
end, I found the rewards far less 
than the effort needed. 

The tensions inherent in the plot 
are also growing less. Norman’s 
wanderings about in Beninia illus- 
trate the point of its peacefulness; 
but they are as exciting as a de- 
scription of his reading a book 
might be. And it seems curious 
that here we are back to simple 
narrative sections to handle what 
Brunner’s complex of other sec- 
tions was apparently designed to 
do earlier. Donald’s efforts in Ya- 
takang depend on good luck and 
otherwise might be any simple spy 
story, except that it ends in a rath- 
er dismal failure which doesn’t 
seem to bother, anyone except 

READING ROOM

Donald, despite the urgency of his 
mission. Lik'ewise the success of 
Norman’s quest for the secret 
turns out to be a bit too simple 
and too unimpressive. I can’t find 
any conviction that the inherent 
peace-creator of the Beninians 
would be any more contagious 
than the agression-creator of the 
rest of the world; and the aggres- 
sors far outnumber the Beninians. 
Too much build-up for too little 
a secret. 

Anyhow, the secret is dug out 
by our old friend and iconoclast, 
Chad C. Mulligan. As a back- 
ground commentator in the early 
part of the book. Mulligan has 
been an interesting personality. 
But Brunner yanks him onto the 
stage, where he becomes no more 
than a capable but unimpressive 
addition to the staff. As an icono- 
clast, he was interesting; as an ikon 
— a stone representation of his 
former self — he is nothing. 

In the end the book becomes 
rather old-fashioned in its depic- 
tion of the future. Too much 
might be the background created 

153 




for an overpopulated world by a 
man writing his story in 1950. 
There is the yammering and semi- 
sane multitude and the crowding 
of the city; there is the drug scene; 
and there are a lot of touches that 
are good and well done, but too 
little below the surface of obvious- 
ness. Pollution, as an example, 
might as well not exist for its ef- 
fect on the story. How the incredi- 
ble future society has kept its in- 
dustrial level so high with such a 
horde of people and not suffered 
what runaway pollution already 
faces us ten years from now is un- 
clear. Beninia seems like a quaint- 
ly unpolluted little backward coun- 
try from a novel of 1935; and Ya- 
takang is aggressively industrial- 
ized to support its more than 200 
million population without any 
evidence of being more polluted 
than Indonesia now. 

Neither Norman nor David real- 
ly does very much that we can see 
as evidence of growth, once they 
leave home (though Norman does 
grow earlier). They tend to adopt 
somewhat changed characters, but 
they weaken before our eyes. And 
the great development of Beninia 
and the handling of the danger of 
Yatakang in its world aggression 
are largely dismissed offhand. 

In the end I think the experiment 
has failed to justify itself. Brunner 
has been caught up in his mechan- 
isms and has let things happen to 
his story that such an excellent 
craftsman as he is would not have 

154 



permitted in a straighter story. 

It’s still a novel worth reading 
for the promises in the earlier sec- 
tions, but one which rates the.raves 
it has received no more than it 
rated the harsh and totally unjust 
reviews it received in some of our 
daily press. 

L ord TYGER, by Philip Jose 
Farmer (Doubleday, $5.95), is 
an experiment of an entirely dif- 
ferent type. Farmer, through the 
many years of his contributions to 
our field, has been one of the bold- 
est innovators. But there is no ob- 
vious mechanism or trickery to his 
book. It is told in straightforward 
prose and follows the course of his 
character’s development about as 
directly and simply as is possible 
in this situation. The experiment 
here is simply in the honesty with 
which he has examined one of our 
hoariest and best beloved tradi- 
tions. 

Farmer is a devoted admirer of 
Edgar Rice Burroughs and has ev- 
en translated Tarzan into Esperan- 
to as a labor of love, essentially. 
But in this novel, he has taken a 
critical look at what would really 
happen to a man brought up as 
our heroic apeman was. 

The result isn’t science fiction, 
of course, though Doubleday la- 
bels the book as such. It’s some- 
thing that can only be categorized 
as a mixture of modern novel and 
adventure story. But since Farmer 
is a leading science-fiction writer 

IF 




and since all the works of Bur- 
roughs, including the Tarzan nov- 
els, are so much a part of most 
readers’ backgrounds, I felt it had 
to be read for review. 

I can’t fault Farmer’s workman- 
ship in this. He never belabors his 
point too strongly, and he does a 
remarkable job of accounting for 
most of the elements of Tyger, the 
man brought up to be Tarzan. 
Both Farmer’s love of the original 
and his attempted honesty in this 
emerge victorious. Yet . 

Essentially, this tells of the at- 
tempt by a multimillionaire Tar- 
zan nut to prove Burroughs could 
have been right. The first attempt 
to get the kidnapped son of a mi- 
nor English nobleman to be 
brought up by apes fails, and the 
child dies. The second attempt re- 
quires preparing the gorillas — the 
best we can do among real apes — 
to receive the child; but this results 
in what would surely happen — the 
child grows up half animal, un- 
able to talk, in the image of the 
real “wolf-boys” that have been 
discovered. 

The third attempt is more care- 
fully staged. (The only fault with 
Farmer’s logic seems to lie in 
managing to have all three boys 
kidnapped from the same parents!) 
A motley group of deformed or 
midget humans raises the boy, tell- 
ing him they are apes (and enough 
different from his appearance to 
make him believe it). He’s careful- 
ly taught to read in an old cabin, 

READING ROOM 



given a knife, etc. He runs across 
the village of black natives, all in 
due course. But there things begin 
to go agley. Instead of beating his 
chest and yelling Ka-Goda at 
them, he gets curious about girls, 
and then proceeds to satisfy his 
curiosity with almost every female 
of the village. 

Eventually, he’s forced to exter- 
minate the village in true Tarzan 
style, but for his own reasons. And 
he is driven to looking for the god 
or demon who rules the isolated 
valley. Since his growth and train- 
ing had to be observed, helicopter 
surveys had to be conducted; and 
he has seen the copters all his life. 
Now he begins to realize some- 
thing must lie behind them. 

Anyhow, eventually he is 
brought out into the great world 
beyond, where the papers make a 
fuss over him as a true “Tarzan.” 
But his character has been shaped 
in ways that would hardly have 
made the real Tarzan of either 
book or screen acceptable to gen- 
erations of followers. I have to ad- 
mit that Farmer is probably cor- 
rect in his depiction of Tyger’s in- 
evitable attitudes. 

Yet, as I ellipsized before, some- 
thing is missing. Somehow, while 
the character is generally true 
throughout and the situation is 
handled better than seemed possi- 
ble, there is no fascination to the 
book. It’s interesting reading as an 
exercise in the writer’s ingenuity 
and skill, but it takes on no life of 

155 




its own, no feeling of interest in 
the basic character. Despite superb 
work at characterizing and devel- 
oping Tyger, he sits in my mind 
dully and his moves do not grip 
me. 

Vm afraid this experiment in 
concept is inherently a failure, 
though one Vm glad to have read. 

Tarzan, as Burroughs saw him, 
was a fairy tale. When we open the 
pages of the book, the events that 
happen are only there to give us an 
excuse to wander through this part 
of fairyland. We have to transport 
ourselves there, and to see the 
landscape illumined by attitudes 
that have departed our familiar 



world of sixty years- and never 
really were a part of the life of our 
daily thought, but only of our lit- 
erary postures. 

You can’t move fairyland into 
the real world; you have to go 
there in your mind, leaving our 
world behind. Long ago, another 
writer tried to be rational about 
what Helen of Troy really went 
through and it was talked about 
and forgotten, because it was a 
failure. Helen remains today the 
myth of human female desirabili- 
ty, never growing old; and Tarzan 
remains the myth of natural and 
hereditary nobility, never having 
license nor libido. #

casionally in small quantity.

Dear Ejler: 

GALAXY is beginning to look up 
with the February issue. SUN POT 
was a disappointment though I have 
high hopes for it's improvement as 
anything by Bode has promise. 

The issue was unusual in that there 
was no story I thought was bad, they 
were all very good; and two stories im- 
pressed with their great depth and rich- 
ness. SLOW SCULPTURE for it's 
magnificent characterization was full 
of a warmth and humanity too many 
times lacking in SF. Too often writers 
use characters solely to explain the 
technology or to move the story with 
dialogue and action. Sturgeon is in 
love with his characters. 

Terseness in writing is supposed to 
be the style these days but in THE 
LAST NIGHT OF THE FESTIVAL 
Dannie Plachta wrote a story beauti- 
ful in it's verbosity. Of course Gaug- 
ham's artwork contributed heavily to 
the atmosphere of the story. Finally 



your Associate Art director is turning 
out some of his Hugo award winning 
work for you. 

Love and Peace, 
Rick Stooker 
Alton, III. 



Dear Sir: 

I finally received a Hand-Signed Re- 
ply from a publication — Galaxy! For 
the last decade, any complaint to a 
publisher seems to have been directed 
again and again to a central computor 
which sends back formal cards having 
little or nothing to do with the prob- 
lem. Since magazine and reader rela- 
tions are a person-to-person thing, I 
am pleased that you have gotten away 
from the idea that a machine can do 
as good an overall job as a human in 
personal contacts. I speak from expe- 
riences with many publications. Evi- 
dently my key punch card has an ir- 
regular form, or the last name is too 
much for the typists. Practically every 
year, I did not receive one or more 
copies of IF. Writing did no good. No 
reply. Hope that this has changed. 

About your February cover — As 
usual, Gaughan does a good job, but 
this cover belongs to "Pressure Ves- 
sel" and not to "Whipping Star" as is 
stated in your table of contents. 

Sincerely, 
Ed Pokropus 
IF-154

A CASE OF CONSCIENCE by Jamoe Bllth. Two 

separate and complete worlds — idyllic Lithia and 
a culture on Earth that has literally gone under 
ground, provides the basis for the story of four 
extraordinary men. There is the priest, dedicated 
to the glory of God; the scientist working for the 
glory of man; the realist who works only for him- 
self; and the man who is content to ask nothing of 
any world, any man, or any deity. The author pre- 
sents a compelling moral problem. This book is 
something of a tour de force.

children who exhibit a strange kind of sinisterism. 
They are dangerous and Midwich must make the

THE SPACE MERCHANTS by Fredorik Pohl and 
C. M. Kornbluth. Two major advertising agencies 
are fighting for the Venus account — nothing less 
than total control of the Venus economy and mar- 
kets will do. It is completely unimportant that 
Venus is a harsh, barren, uninhabited planet. 
According to the mentality of Mitchell Courtenay 
of Fowler Schocken Associates, the trick is to per- 
suade colonists to go to Venus, and once there, 
they will have to survive as best they can. One of 
the most savage and devastating attacks on mod- 
ern consumer society and the advertising agents 
who are its high priests. The Space Merchants is 
uncomfortably prophetic.
