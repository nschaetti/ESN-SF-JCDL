EDITOR'S PAGE 



Let us today speak of fences. 

In the course of a discussion of his 
latest novel. Dying Inside — launched 
in this issue of Galaxy — Robert 
Silverberg asked me if 1 had heard of 
a Finnish science-fiction magazine, 
Aikamme, which had published one of 
his stories. 1 had not, until that mo- 
ment, but the title of the publication 
translates literally and exactly into 
Our Times(s) — the word is at once 
singular and plural. 

And as the title of a periodical pub- 
lishing science fiction it would seem 
to suggest that we live in science- 
fiction times. 

Perhaps we do. Few if any of us 
survive any given twenty-four hours 
without being touched by the witch’s 
wand of modern science. According 
to some estimates human knowledge 
has been doubling itself every eight 
years and promises to continue to do 
so. We carry it with us to the fastest 
and loneliest wilderness; it reaches 
us at work and play— and what 
the physiological and genetic effects 
have been and will be on Man and his 
mind we have barely begun to assess. 

The above isn’t to say that you’ve 
met the real-life prototype of David 
Selig, Bob Silverberg’s abortive rnind- 
mutant in Dying Inside — but hard 
evidence may be imminent that he 
could be around. 

Sometimes the endless argument as 
to what science fiction is finds easy 
answers. A few short months ago 
James White’s Dark Inferno, Isaac 
Asimov’s The Gods Themselves and 



Colin Kapp’s Patterns of Chaos — 
all solidly based in hard science and 
Dr. Asimov’s novel exquisitely so — 
were jostling each other for space on 
the pages of Galaxy and If. Since then 
not one such work has crossed my 
desk. To your loss and mine. 

This essay is not an advocacy of 
currency or “relevance” in science 
fiction, or any other fencing in of the 
medium. In a day when Man has pro- 
pelled his image beyond galactic 
bounds (Pioneer 10), when Earth’s 
own limits range from subatomics to 
the stars — and thence, by definition, 
beyond time itself — the hard sciences 
are exotic enough to accommodate 
virtually all science-fiction disciplines. 

But today’s science fiction is being 
written today and 1 will confess to a 
profound curiosity as to all that science 
fiction will say that has not been said — 
all it will add to what has been said — 
in a time when the intricate science 
underlying our technology pervades 
every breath we take, touches every 
move we make, anywhere on this 
globe. 

The fences are down — or will be — 
and we must choose Directions. 

Cy Chauvin’s letter in Directions 
(Galaxy, March ’72) touched off a 
flood of replies impossible to contain 
in one issue. You will find two in the 
current Directions — more to come. 
Some excerpts: 

". science fiction doesn't have a 
purpose ...” Judith M. Hochberg. 

"... The purpose of sf (is) to out- 
line change ...” Charles Gifford, Jr. 

". (in)sf insight is the product . ." 
J. R. Yearwood.

I 

S o, THEN, I have to go down- 
town to the University and 
forage for dollars again. It 
doesn’t take much cash to keep 
me going — two hundred a month 
will do nicely — but I’m running 
low and I don’t dare try to borrow 
from my sister again. The students 
will shortly be needing their first 
term papers of the semester — 
that’s always a steady business. 
The weary, eroding brain of 
David Selig is once more for hire. 
I should be able to pick up seventy- 
five dollars’ worth of work on this 
lovely golden October morning. 
The air is crisp and clear. A high- 
pressure system covers New York 
City, banishing humidity and 
haze. In such weather my fading 
powers still flourish. Let us go 
then, you and I, when the morning 
is spread out against the sky. 

You and I. To whom do I 
refer? I’m heading downtown 
alone, after all. You and I. 

Why, of course I refer to myself 
and to that creature who lives 
within me, spying on unsuspecting 
mortals. That sneaky monster 
within me, that ailing monster, 
dying even more swiftly than I. 
Let us go then, you and 1. Down 
the hall. Push the button. Into the 
elevator. There is a stink of garlic 
in it. My neighbors — they leave 
their emphatic smells everywhere. 
1 love them. Down. Down. 

It is 10:43 A.M., Eastern Daylight 



Saving Time. The current tem- 
perature reading in Central Park is 
57°. The humidity stands at 28% 
and the barometer is 30.30 and 
falling, with the wind northeast at 
1 1 miles per hour. The forecast is 
for fair skies and sunny weather to- 
day, tonight and tomorrow. David 
Selig is forty-one and counting. 
Slightly above medium height, he 
has the lean figure of a bachelor 
accustomed to his own meager 
cooking and his customary facial 
expression is a mild, puzzled frown. 
He blinks a lot. In his faded blue 
denim jacket, heavy-duty boots, 
and 1969-vintage striped bells he 
presents a superficially youthful 
appearance at least from the neck 
down — but in fact he looks like 
some sort of refugee from an il- 
licit research laboratory where the 
balding, furrowed heads of an- 
guished middle-aged men are 
grafted to the reluctant bodies of 
adolescent boys. How did this 
happen to him? At what point did 
his face and scalp begin to grow 
old? The dangling cables of the 
elevator hurl shrieks of mocking 
laughter at him as he descends 
from his two-room refuge on the 
twelfth floor. He wonders if those 
rusty cables might be even older 
than he is. He is of the 1935 vin- 
tage. This housing project, he 
suspects, might date from 1933 
or 1934. Though perhaps it’s 
younger — just immediately pre- 
war, say. (Do you remember 1940, 
Duvid? That was the year we took

GALAXY 



you to the World’s Fair. This is 
the trylon, that’s the perisphere.) 
Anyway the buildings are getting 
old. What isn’t? 

The elevator halts grindingly at 
the 7th floor. Even before the 
scarred door opens 1 detect a 
quick mental flutter of female 
Hispanic vitality dancing through 
the girders. A young Puerto Rican 
wife. Sure enough. She is short, 
swarthy, maybe about twenty-three 
years old and very pregnant. 1 can 
pick up the double neural output 
clearly: the quicksilver darting of 
her shallow, sensual mind and the 
furry, blurry thumpings of the 
fetus, about six months old, sealed 
within her hard bulging body. She 
is flat-faced and broad-hipped, 
with little glossy eyes and a thin, 
pinched mouth. A first child, a 
dirty girl of about two, clutches her 
mother’s thumb. The tot giggles 
up at me and the woman favors me 
with a brief, suspicious smile as 
they enter the elevator. 

They stand with their backs to- 
ward me. Dense silence. Buenos 
(Has, sehora. Nice day, isn’t it, 
ma’am? What a lovely little child. 
But I remain mute. I don’t know 
the woman — she looks like all the 
others who live in this project and 
even her cerebral output is stan- 
dard stuff, unindividuated, in- 
distinguishable: vague thoughts, 
no doubt, of plantains and rice, this 
week’s lottery results and tonight’s 
television highlights. She is a dull 
bitch but she is human and I love 



her. What’s her name? Maybe it’s 
Mrs. Altagracia Morales. Mrs. 
Amantina Figueroa. Mrs. Filo- 
mena Mercado. I love their names. 
Pure poetry. I grew up with plump, 
clumping girls named Sondra 
Wiener, Beverly Schwartz, Sheila 
Weisbard. Ma’am, can you pos- 
sibly be Mrs. Inocencia Fernandez? 
Her name comes to me — Esperanza 
Dominguez. Esperanza. Espe- 
ranza. 1 love you, Esperanza. 
Ground floor. Nimbly I step for- 
ward to hold the door open. The 
lovely stolid pregnant chiquita 
doesn’t smile at me as she exists. 

T O THE subway now, hippity- 
hop, one long block away. This 
far uptown the tracks are still 
elevated. The station at this hour 
is practically deserted. But in a 
moment I hear the wailing of on- 
rushing wheels, metal on metal, 
and simultaneously I pick up the 
blasting impact of a sudden phalanx 
of minds all rushing toward me at 
once out of the north, packed 
aboard the five or six cars of the 
oncoming train. The compressed 
souls of those passengers form a 
single inchoate mass, pressing in- 
sistently against me. They quiver 
like trembling jellylike bits of 
plankton squeezed brutally to- 
gether in some oceanographer’s 
net, creating one complex orga- 
nism in which the separate identi- 
ties of all are lost. As the train 
glides into the station I am able to 
pick up isolated blurts and squeaks 



DYING INSIDE

of discrete selfhood: a fierce jab of 
desire, a squawk of hatred, a pang 
of regret, a sudden purposeful 
inner mumbling, rising from the 
confusing totality the way odd little 
scraps and stabs of melody rise 
from the murky orchestral smear 
of a Mahler symphony. The power 
is deceptively strong in me today. 
I’m picking up plenty. This is the 
strongest it’s been in weeks. Surely 
the low humidity is a factor. But 
I’m not deceived into thinking that 
the decline in my ability has been 
checked. When I first began to 
lose my hair there was a happy 
period when the process of erosion 
seemed to halt and reverse itself, 
when new patches of fine dark 
floss began to sprout on my de- 
nuded forehead. But this was no 
miraculous reforestation, only a 
twitch of the hormones, a tempo- 
rary cessation of decay, not to be 
relied upon. And in time my hair- 
line resumed its retreat. So, too, in 
this instance. When one knows 
that something is dying inside one, 
one learns not to put much trust 
in the random vitalities of the fleet- 
ing moment. Today the power is 
strong — tomorrow I may hear 
nothing but distant tantalizing 
murmurs. 

1 find a seat in the corner of the 
second car, open my book and wait 
out the ride downtown. I am read- 
ing Beckett again, Malone Dies; 
it plays nicely to my prevailing 
mood, which as you have noticed 
is one of self-pity. 



Somewhere about 180th Street 
I look up and see a girl sitting 
diagonally opposite me and ap- 
parently studying me. She is in 
her very early twenties, attractive 
in a sallow way, with long legs, 
decent breasts, a bush of auburn 
hair. Is she interested in me? I am 
not reading her mind — when I en- 
tered the train I automatically 
stepped my inputs down to the 
minimum, a trick I learned when 1 
was a child. If I didn’t insulate my- 
self against scattershot crowd- 
noises on trains or in other en- 
closed public places 1 couldn’t con- 
centrate at all. Without attempting 
to detect her signals I speculate on 
what she’s thinking about me — I’m 
playing a game I often play. How 
intelligent he looks . He must 
have suffered a good deal — his 
face is so much older than his 
body . tenderness in his eyes . 
so sad they look ... a poet, a 
scholar ... I bet he’s very passion- 
ate .. pouring all his pent-up love 
into the physical act . What’s he 
reading? Beckett? Yes, a poet, a 
novelist, he must be .. maybe 
somebody famous. I mustn’t be too 
aggressive, though. He’ll be turned 
off by pushiness. A shy smile, 
that’ll catch him . one thing 
leads to another . I’ll invite him 
up for lunch . 

Then, to check on the accuracy 
of my intuitive perceptions, I tune 
in on her mind. At first there is no 
signal. My damnable waning 
powers are betraying me again. 



10 



GALAXY 



But then it comes — static, first, 
as 1 get the low-level muzzy rumi- 
nations of all the passengers around 
me, then the clear sweet tone of 
her soul. She is thinking about a 
karate class she will attend later 
this morning on 96th Street. She 
is in love with her instructor, a 
brawny pockmarked Japanese. She 
will see him tonight. Dimly through 
her mind swims the memory of the 
taste of sake and the image of his 
powerful naked body rearing above 
her. There is nothing in her mind 
about me. I am simply part of the 
scenery, like the map of the subway 
system on the wall above my head, 
^lig, your egocentricity kills you 
every time. She does indeed wear 
a shy smile now, but it is not for 
me and when she sees me staring at 
her the smile vanishes abruptly. 

T he train treats me to a long 
sweaty unscheduled halt in the 
tunnel between stations north of 
137th Street — eventually it gets 
going again and deposits me at 
1 16th Street, Columbia University. 

I climb toward the sunlight. I 
first climbed these stairs a full 
quarter of a century ago, October 
’51, a terrified high-school senior 
with acne and a crew-cut, coming 
out of. Brooklyn for my college 
entrance interview. 

1 walk along 1 16th Street. To my 
right, the broad greensward of 
South Field — to my left, the shal- 
low steps rising to Low Library. I 
remember South Field when it was 



an athletic field in the middle of the 
campus, brown dirt, basepaths, 
fence. In my freshman year 1 
played softball there. I was good at 
softball. Not much muscle, but 
quick reflexes and a good eye— and 
I had the advantage of knowing 
what was on the pitcher’s mind. 
He’d stand there thinking. This 
guy’s too skinny to hit — I’ll give 
him a high fast one . and I’d be 
ready for it and bust it out into left 
field, circling the bases before any- 
one knew what was happening. Of 
course it was only softball and my 
classmates were mostly pudgy dubs 
who couldn’t even run, let alone 
read minds, but at the time I en- 
joyed the unfamiliar sensation of 
being an outstanding athlete. In 
my sophomore yeafThey ripped up 
South Field and turned it into a 
fine grassy showplace divided by a 
paved promenade, in honor of the 
University’s 200th birthday. Which 
happened in 1954. Christ, so very 
long ago. 

I go up the steps and take a seat 
about fifteen feet to the left of the 
bronze statue of Alma Mater. This 
is my office in fair weather or foul. 
The students know where to look 
for me and when I’m there the word 
quickly spreads. There are five or 
six other people who provide the 
service I provide — impecunious 
graduate students, mostly, down 
on their luck — but I’m the quick- 
est and most reliable and I have an 
enthusiastic following. 

“Mr. Selig?’’ 



DYING INSIDE 



11 



Big brawny jock looming above 
me. Colossal shoulders, chubby 
innocent face. He’s taking Comp 
Lit 18 and needs a paper fast on 
the novels of Kafka, which he 
hasn’t read. (This is the football 
season — he’s the starting halfback 
and he’s very, very busy.) I tell him 
the terms and he hastily agrees. 
While he stands there 1 covertly 
take a reading of him, getting the 
measure of his intelligence, his 
probable vocabulary, his style. 
He’s smarter than he appears. 
Most of them are. They could 
write their own papers well enough 
if they only had the time. I make 
notes, setting down my quick im- 
pressions of him, and he goes away 
happy. Trade is brisk after that. 
He sends a fraternity brother, the 
brother sends a friend, the friend 
sends a brother from a different 
fraternity — and the daisy-chain 
lengthens until by early afternoon 
I find I’ve taken on all the work I 
can handle. So all is well. I’ll eat 
regularly for two or three weeks 
without having to tap my sister’s 
grudging generosity. Judith will be 
pleased not to hear from me. 
Home, now, to begin my ghostly 
tasks. I’m good — glib, earnest, 
profound in a convincingly sopho- 
moric way — and 1 can vary my 
styles. I know my way around 
literature, psychology, anthropol- 
ogy, philosophy, all the soft sub-

W HEN he was seven and a 
half years old and causing a 
great deal of trouble for his third- 
grade teacher little David was sent 
to the school psychiatrist. Dr. Hitt- 
ner, for an examination. The 
school was an expensive private 
one on a quiet leafy street in the 
Park Slope section of Brooklyn. 
Its orientation was socialist- 
progressive and the psychiatrist, a 
specialist in the disturbances of 
middle-class children, paid a call 
every Wednesday afternoon. Every- 
one agreed that David was a bril- 
liant child: he was extraordinarily 
precocious, with a reading-compre- 
hension score on the twelve-year- 
old level, and adults found him 
almost frighteningly bright. But 
he was uncontrollable in class, 
raucous, disrespectful. The school- 
work, hopelessly elementary for 
him, bored him to desperation. 
His only friends were the class mis- 
fits, whom he persecuted cruelly. 
Most of the children hated him and 
the teachers feared his unpredict- 
ability. One day he had up-ended 
a hallway fire extinguisher simply 
to see if it would spray foam as 
promised. It did. He brought 
garter snakes to school and let them 
loose in the auditorium. He mimed

classmates and even teachers with 
vicious accuracy. 

“Dr. Hittner would just like to 
have a little chat with you,” his 
mother told him. “He’s heard 
you’re a very special boy and he’d 
like to get to know you better.” 

David resisted, kicking up a 
great fuss over the psychiatrist’s 
name. “Hitler? Hitler? 1 don’t 
want to talk to Hitler!” It was the 
fall of 1942 and the childish pun 
was an inevitable one, but he clung 
to it with irritating stubbornness. 
“Dr. Hitler wants to see me. Dr. 
Hitler wants to get to know me.” 

And his mother said, “No, 
Duvid, it’s Hittner, Hittner, with 
an n.” 

He went anyway. He strutted into 
the psychiatrist’s office and when 
Dr. Hittner smiled benignly and 
said, “Hello, there, David,” David 
shot forth a stiff arm and snapped, 
“Heil!” 

Dr. Hittner chuckled. “You’ve 
got the wrong man,” he said. “I’m 
Hittner, with an n.” Perhaps he had 
heard such jokes before. He was a 
huge man with a long horsy face, 
a wide fleshy mouth, a high curv- 
ing forehead. His skin was soft and 
pink and he had a good tangy smell. 
He was trying hard to seem friendly 
and amused and big-brotherly, 
but David couldn’t help picking up 
the impression that Dr. Hittner’s 
brotherliness was just an act. It 
was something he felt with most 
adults — they smiled a lot, but in- 
side themselves they were thinking

Books 

THIS is the July issue, and presently 
we shall talk about our May-June 
books. But actually, for us, it's the 
depth of winter 1971/72, and we have 
been desperately trying to get our 
copy written for next Fall's '72/73 
list — the books for which were, in 
fact, read and bought last summer, 
'71. And we have just concluded a 
review of the royalty statements for 
books published that same summer, 
purchased up to eighteen months 
before — say Spring, 1970 — and writ- 
ten God knows how long before that. 
The long rhythms of publishing. Writ- 
ing is a courageous profession. And 
one that must be carried on continu- 
ously, not to say compulsively. Other- 
wise the whole house of cards falls 
apart. 

• • • 

PUBLISHING of course is not a pro- 
fession. It's a madness. Requiring the 
catch-all charms of gambler, psychia- 
trist, banker, editor, jailor, tax-consul- 
tant, mother, father, merchandiser and 
entertainer (ever been to a sales con- 
ference?) And it is a fall-out point. The 
publisher is where the buck — good, 
bad, or non-existent — comes to rest. 
It's very hard for writers or distributors 
to believe this. But the fact is, there 
are no advances, no guarantees for the 
publisher. He gets to make his first 
investments in a contract. He waits, 
and (if he's lucky) the ms. arrives when 
it should. Most often — about 80% of 
the time — it's late. Up to twelve years 
late in the experience of this publisher 
(and all you guys out there who are 
currently two or three years late just 
don't get any ideas). Sometimes the 



DYING INSIDE 



13 



ms. never does come in, or it does and 
it's a disaster. Soothe and write-off. 
But let's pretend it's here and it's good, 
great, glorious (or, with work, it can be 
made so). Now there is only a year or 
so to wart until the publisher ducky 
fellow) can make his next big invest- 
ment — actual publication. After that, 
it's simply a matter of time (about 
another year) before we all know 
whether we're rich, famous, or the 
whole thing remains to be done over 
again. (And the publisher, naturally, 
absorbs the returns. .)

IN THE face of all this anxiety, effort 
and risk, how any reader can bear not 
to buy a book is past understanding. 
Now that you do understand, you know 
what to do. Therefore, blithe, gallant 
and indomitable, we are glad to an- 
nounce that in May we will make avail- 
able to a by-now desperately waiting 
public, the following: 

DERYNI CHECKMATE, Katherine 
Kurtz, SI. 25. The second volume in 
the annals of the Deryni — that some- 
thing more-than-human race. Thought- 
provoking adventure. No mindless 
sword carriers here.

SPACE SKIMMER, DavidGerrold. 95e. 
The first of a series about the "ulti- 
mate spaceship. " So Dave thinks. 
What it's really about is people — lost, 
imperfect, afraid — and fighting their 
way to one another anyhow. Very, very 
good. 

WITH A FINGER IN MY EYE, David

things like, What a scary brat, 
what a creepy little kid. Even his 
mother and father sometimes 
thought things like that. He didn’t 
understand why adults said one 
thing with their faces and another 
with their minds, but he was ac- 
customed to it. 

“Let’s play some games, shall 
we?’’ Dr. Hittner said. 

O UT of the vest pocket of his 
tweed suit he produced a 
little plastic globe on a metal chain. 
He showed it to David. Then he 
pulled on the chain and the globe 
came apart into eight or nine pieces 
of different colors. “Watch 
closely now while 1 put it back 
together,” said Dr. Hittner. His 
thick fingers expertly reassembled 
the globe. Then he pulled it apart 
again and shoved it across the desk 
toward David. “Your turn. Can 
you put it back together, too?” 
David remembered that the 
doctor had started by taking the 
E-shaped white piece and fitting 
the D-shaped blue piece into one of 
its grooves. Then had come the 
yellow piece, but David didn’t re- 
call what to do with it. He sat 
there a moment, puzzled, until Dr. 
Hittner obligingly flashed him a 
mental image of the proper mani- 
pulation. David did it and the rest 
was easy. A couple of times he got 
stuck, but he was always able to 
pull the answer out of the doctor’s 
mind. Why does he think he’s test- 
ing me, David wondered, if he

keeps giving me so many hints? 
What’s he proving? 

“Would you like to keep it?” 

“I don’t need it,” David said. 
But he pocketed it anyway. 

They played a few more games. 
There was one with little cards 
about the size of playing cards, with 
drawings of animals and birds and 
trees and houses on them. David 
was supposed to arrange them so 
that they told a story and then tell 
the doctor what the story was. He 
scattered them at random on the 
desk and made up a story as he 
went along. “The duck goes into 
the forest, you see, and he meets a 
wolf, so he turns into a frog and 
jumps over the wolf right into the 
elephant’s mouth, only he escapes 
out of the elephant’s tushie and 
falls into a lake and when he comes 
out he sees the pretty princess 
here, who says come home and I’ll 
give you a gingerbread, but he can 
read her mind and he sees that she’s 
really a wicked witch, who — ” 
Another game involved slips of 
paper that had big twin inkblots 
on them. 

“Do any of these shapes remind 
you of real things?” 

“Yes,” David said, “this is an 
elephant, see, his tail is here and 
here all crumpled up — and this is 
his tushie and this is where he 
makes pee-pee.” He had already 
discovered that Dr. Hittner became 
very interested when he talked 
about tushies or pee-pee, so he 
gave the doctor plenty to be in- 



terested about, finding such things 
in every inkblot picture. This 
seemed a very silly game to David, 
but apparently it was important to 
Dr. Hittner, who scribbled notes 
on everything David was saying. 
David studied Dr. Hittner’s mind 
while the psychiatrist wrote things 
down. Most of the words he picked 
up were incomprehensible, but he 
did recognize a few, the grownup 
terms for the parts of the body that 
David’s mother had taught him; 
penis, vulva, buttocks, rectum — 
things like that. Obviously Dr. 
Hittner liked those words a great 
deal, so David began to use them. 
“This is a picture of an eagle that’s 
picking up a little sheep and flying 
away with it. This is the eagle’s 
penis, down here, and over here is 
the sheep’s rectum. And in the next 
one there’s a man and a woman and 
they’re both naked and the man is 
trying to . .” David watched the 
fountain pen flying over the paper. 
He grinned at Dr. Hittner and 
turned to the next inkblot. 

Next they played word games. 
The doctor spoke a word and asked 
David to say the first word that 
came into his head. David found 
it more amusing to say the first 
word that came into Dr. Hittner’s 
head. It took only a fraction of a 
second to pick it up and Dr. Hitt- 
ner didn’t seem to notice what was 
going on. 

The game went like this: 

“Father.” 

“Penis.” 



DYING INSIDE 



15 



“Mother.” 

“Bed.” 

“Baby.” 

“Dead.” 

“Water.” 

“Belly.” 

“Tunnel.” 

“Shovel.” 

“Coffin.” 

“Mother.” 

Were those the right words to 
say? Who was the winner in this 
game? Why did Dr. Hittner seem 
so upset? 

Finally they stopped playing 
games and simply talked. “You’re 
a very bright little boy,” Dr. Hitt- 
ner said. “1 don’t have to worry 
about spoiling you by telling you 
that, because you know it already. 
What do you want to be when you 
grow up?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Nothing?” 

“I just want to play and read a lot 
of books and swim.” 

“But how will you earn a living?” 
“I’ll get money from people 
when I need it.” 

“If you find out how — I hope 
you’ll tell me the secret,” the 
doctor said. “Are you happy here 
in school?” 

“No.” 

“Why not?” 

“The teachers are too strict. The 
work is too dumb. The children 
don’t like me.” 

“Do you ever wonder why they 
don’t like you?” 

“Because I’m smarter than they 



are,” David said. “Because I — ” 
Ooops. Almost said it. Because / 
can see what they're thinking. 
Mustn’t ever tell anyone that. Dr. 
Hittner was waiting for him to 
finish the sentence. “Because 1 
make a lot of trouble in class.” 
“And why do you do that, 
David?” 

“I don’t know. It gives me some- 
thing to do, I guess.” 

“Maybe if you didn’t make so 
much trouble people would like 
you more. Don’t you want people 
to like you?” 

“1 don’t care. I don’t need it.” 
“Everybody needs friends, 
David.” 

“I’ve got friends.” 

“Mrs. Fleischer says you don’t 
have very many and that you hit 
them a lot and make them un- 
happy. Why do you hit your 
friends?” 

“Because I don’t like them. Be- 
cause they’re dumb.” 

“Then they aren’t really friends 
— if that’s how you feel about 
them.” 

Shrugging, David said, “I can 
get along without them. 1 have fun 
just being by myself.” 

“Are you happy at home?” 

“I guess so.” 

“You love your mommy and 
daddy?” 

A pause. A feeling of great ten- 
sion coming out of the doctor’s 
mind. This is an important ques- 
tion. Give the right answer, David. 
Give him the answer he wants. 



16 



GALAXY 



“Yes,” David said. 

“Do you ever wish you had a 
baby brother or sister?” 

No hesitation now. “No.” 
“Really, no? You like being all 
alone?” 

David nodded. “The afternoons 
are the best time. When I’m home 
from school and there’s nobody 
around. Am I going to have a baby 
brother or sister?” 

Chuckles from the doctor. “I’m 
sure I don’t know. That would be 
up to your mommy and daddy, 
wouldn’t it?” 

“You won’t tell them to get one 
for me, will you? I mean, you might 
say to them that it would be good 
for me to have one and then they’d 
go and get one, but I really don’t 
want — ” I’m in trouble, David 
realized suddenly. 

“What makes you think I’d tell 
your parents it would be good for 
you to have a baby brother or 
sister?” the doctor asked quietly, 
not smiling now at all. 

“I don’t know. It was just an 
idea.” Which I found inside your 
head. Doctor. And now I want to 
get out of here. I don’t want to talk 
to you any more. “Hey, your name 
isn’t really Hittner, is it? With an 
n? I bet I know your real name.

I NEVER could send my 
thoughts into anybody else’s 



head. Even when the power was 
strongest in me I couldn’t transmit. 
I could only receive. Maybe there 
are people around who do have 
that power, who can transmit 
thoughts even to those who don’t 
have any special receiving gift, 
but 1 wasn’t ever one of them. So 
right there 1 was condemned to 
be society’s ugliest toad, the eaves- 
dropper, the voyeur. A kind of 
leech, secretly sucking emotional 
vitality from others. A vampire bat. 
Old English proverb; He who peeps 
through a hole may see what will 
vex him. Yes. In those years when 
I was particularly eager to com- 
municate with people I’d work up 
fearful sweats trying to plant my 
thoughts in them. I’d sit in a class- 
room staring at the back of some 
girl’s head and I’d think hard at 
her; Hello, Annie, this is David 
Selig calling — do you read me? 
Do you read me? I love you, Annie. 
Over. Over and out. But Annie 
never read me and the currents of 
her mind would roll on like a placid 
river, undisturbed by the existence 
of David Selig. 

No way, then, for me to speak to 
other minds, only to spy on them. 
The way the power manifests itself 
in me has always been highly vari- 
able. I never had much conscious 
control over it, other than being 
able to step down the intensity of 
input and to do a certain amount 
of fine tuning — basically I had to 
take whatever came drifting in. 
Most often 1 would pick up a per- 



DYING INSIDE 



17 



son’s surface thoughts, his sub- 
vocalizations of the things he would 
be just about to say. These would 
come to me in a clear conversa- 
tional manner, exactly as though he 
had said them, except The tone of 
voice would be different — plainly 
not a tone produced by the vocal 
apparatus. 1 don’t remember any 
period even in my childhood when 
1 confused spoken communica- 
tion with mental communication. 
This ability to read surface 
thoughts has been fairly consistent 
throughout — I still can anticipate 
verbal statements more often than 
not, especially when I’m with some- 
one who has the habit of rehearsing 
what he intends to say. 

I could also and to some extent 
still can anticipate immediate in- 
tentions, such as the decision to 
throw a short right jab to the jaw. 
My way of knowing such things 
varies. I might pick up a coherent 
inner verbal statement — I'm now 
going to throw a short right jab to 
his jaw — or, if the power happens 
to be working on deeper levels that 
day, I may simply pick up a series 
of nonverbal instructions to the 
muscles, which add up in a frac- 
tion of a second to the process of 
bringing the right arm up for a 
short jab to the jaw. Call it body 
language on the telepathic wave- 
length. 

Another thing I’ve been able to 
do, though never consistently, is 
tune in to the deepest layers of the 
mind — where the soul lives, if you 



will. Where the consciousness lies 
bathed in a murky soup of in- 
distinct unconscious phenomena. 
Here lurk hopes, fears, percep- 
tions, purposes, passions, mem- 
ories, philosophical positions, 
moral policies, hungers, sorrows, 
the whole ragbag accumulation 
that defines the private self. Ordi- 
narily some of this bleeds through 
to me even when the most super- 
ficial mental contact is established 
— I can’t help getting a certain 
amount of information about the 
coloration of the soul. But occa- 
sionally — hardly ever, now — I 
fasten my hooks into the real stuff, 
the whole person. There’s ecstasy 
in that. There’s an electrifying 
sense of contact. Coupled, of 
course, with a stabbing, numbing 
sense of guilt, because of the total- 
ity of my voyeurism — how much 
more of a peeping tom can a per- 
son be? Incidentally, the soul 
speaks a universal language. When 
I look into the mind of Mrs. 
Esperanza Dominguez, say, and 1 
get a gabble of Spanish out of it — 
I don’t really know what she’s 
thinking because I don’t under- 
stand very much Spanish. But if 
I were to get into the depths of her 
soul I’d have complete compre- 
hension of anything I picked up. 
The mind may think in Spanish 
or Basque or Hungarian or Fin- 
nish, but the soul thinks in lan- 
guageless language accessible to any 
prying sneaking freak who comes 
along to peer at its mysteries.

THE NOVELS OF KAFKA 

In the nightmare world of 
The Trial and The Castle only 
one thing is certain: that the 
central figure, significantly 
known by the initial K, is 
doomed to frustration. All 
else is dreamlike and unsure — 
courtrooms spring up in tene- 
ments, mysterious warders 
devour one’s breakfast, a man 
thought to be Sordini is actu- 
ally Sortini. The central fact is 
certain, though: K will fail 
in his attempt to attain grace. 

The two novels have the 
same theme and approximately 
the same basic structure. In 
both K seeks for grace and is 
led to the final realization that 
it is to be withheld from him. 
(The Castle is unfinished, but 
its conclusion seems plain.) 
Kafka brings his heroes into 
involvement with their situa- 
tions in opposite ways. In The 
Trial Joseph K. is passive 
until he is jolted into the action 
of the book by the unexpected 
arrival of the two warders. In 
The Castle K is first shown as 
an active character making ef- 
forts on his own behalf to 



reach the mysterious Castle. 
To be sure, though, he has 
originally been summoned by 
the Castle — the action did not 
originate in himself — and thus 
he began as as passive a char- 
acter as Joseph K. The distinc- 
tion is that The Trial opens at 
a point earlier in the time 
stream of the action -at the 
earliest possible point, in fact. 
The Castle follows more 
closely the ancient rule of be- 
ginning in medias res, with K 
already summoned and trying 
to reach the Castle. 

Both books get off to rapid 
starts. Joseph K. is arrested in 
the very first sentence of The 
Trial and his counterpart K ar- 
rives at what he thinks is going 
to be the last stop before the 
Castle on the first page of that 
novel. From there both Ks 
struggle futilely toward their 
goals (in The Castle simply to 
get to the top of the hill; in The 
Trial, first to understand the 
nature of his guilt and then, 
despairing of this, to achieve 
acquittal without understand- 
ing). Both actually get farther 
from their goals with each 
succeeding action. The Trial 
reaches its peak in the wonder- 
ful Cathedral scene, quite 
likely the most terrifying single 
sequence in any of Kafka’s 
work, in which K is given to 
realize that he is guilty and 
can never be acquitted — the 



DYING INSIDE 



19 



chapter that follows, describ- 
ing K’s execution, is little more 
than an anticlimactic appen- 
dage. The Castle, less com- 
plete than The Trial, lacks the 
counterpart of the Cathedral 
scene (perhaps Kafka was un- 
able to devise one?) and thus 
is artistically less satisfying 
than the shorter, more in- 
tense, more tightly contracted 
Trial. 

Despite their surface art- 
lessness, both novels appear to 
be built on the fundamental 
three-part structure of the 
tragic rhythm labeled by the 
critic Kenneth Burke as “pur- 
pose, passion, perception.” 
The Trial follows this scheme 
with greater success than does 
the incomplete Castle — the 
purpose, to achieve acquittal, 
is demonstrated through as 
harrowing a passion as any 
fictional hero has undergone. 
Finally, when Joseph K. has 
been reduced from his original 
defiant, self-confident attitude 
to a fearful, timid state of 
mind — and he is obviously 
ready to capitulate to the 
forces of the Court — the time 
is at hand for the final moment 
of perception . 

That’s not so bad. Six double- 
spaced typed pages. At three-fifty 
per it earns me a cool twenty-one 
dollars for less than two hours’ 
work and it will earn the brawny 



halfback, Mr. Paul F. Bruno, a 
sure B-i- from Professor Schmitz. 
I’m confident of that because the 
very same paper, differing only in 
a few minor stylistic flourishes, got 
me a B from the very demanding 
Professor Dupee in May, 1955. 
Standards are lower today, after 
two decades of academic inflation. 
Bruno may even rack up an A- for 
the Kafka job. It’s got just the 
right quality of earnest intelligence, 
with the proper undergraduate 
mixture of sophisticated insight 
and naive dogmatism. All right, 
now. Time out for a little chow 
mein, with maybe a side order of 
eggroll. Then I’ll tackle Odysseus 
as a Symbol of Society or perhaps 
Aeschylus and the Aristotelian 
Tragedy. 1 can’t work from my 
own old term papers for those, but 
they shouldn’t be too tough to do. 
Old typewriter, old humbugger, 
stand me now and ever in good 
stead.

ALDOUS HUXLEY thought 
l\. that evolution had designed 
our brains to serve as filters, screen- 
ing out a lot ’of stuff of no real 
value to us in our daily struggle 
for bread. Visions, mystical ex- 
periences, psi phenomena such as 
telepathic messages from other 
brains — all sorts of things along 
these lines would forever be flood- 
ing into us were it not for the action 
of what Huxley called, in a little 



20 



GALAXY 



book entitled Heaven and Hell, 
“the cerebral reducing valve.” 
Thank God for the cerebral re- 
ducing valve! If we hadn’t evolved 
it, we’d be distracted all the time by 
scenes of incredible beauty, by 
spiritual insights of overwhelming 
grandeur and by searing, utterly 
honest mind-to-mind contact with 
our fellow human beings. Luckily 
the workings of the valve protect 
us — most of us — from such things, 
and we are free to go about our 
daily lives, buying cheap and sell- 
ing dear. 

Of course, some of us seem to be 
born with defective valves. I mean 
artists like Bosch or El Greco, 
whose eyes did not see the world 
as it appears to thee and me — I 
mean the visionary philosophers, 
the ecstatics and the nirvana-at- 
tainers — I mean the miserable 
freakish flukes who can read the 
thoughts of others. Mutants, all of 
us. Genetic sports. 

However, Huxley believed that 
the efficiency of the cerebral re- 
ducing valve could be impaired by 
various artificial means, thus giv- 
ing ordinary mortals access to 
the extrasensory data customarily 
seen only by the chosen few. The 
psychedelic drugs, he thought, 
could have this effect. Mescalin, 
he suggested, interferes with the 
enzyme system that regulates 
cerebral function and by so doing 
“lowers the efficiency of the brain 
as an instrument for focusing mind 
on the problems of life on the sur- 



face of our planet. This . seems to 
permit the entry into conscious- 
ness of certain classes of mental 
events, which are normally ex- 
cluded, because they possess no 
survival value. Similar intrusions 
of biologically useless, but aes- 
thetically and sometimes spiritually 
valuable, material may occur as the 
result of illness or fatigue; or they 
may be induced by fasting, or a 
period of confinement in a place of 
darkness and complete silence.” 

Speaking for himself, David Selig 
can say very little about the psyche- 
delic drugs. He had only one experi- 
ence with them and it wasn’t a 
happy one. That was in the summer 
of 1968, when he was living with 
Toni. (You don’t know yet who 
Toni is. Be patient. I’ll get to her.) 

Though Huxley thought highly of 
the psychedelics, he didn’t see 
them as the only gateway to vision- 
ary experience. Fasting and physi- 
cal mortification could also get 
you there. He wrote of mystics 
who “regularly used upon them- 
selves the whip of knotted leather 
or even of iron wire. These beatings 
were the equivalent of fairly exten- 
sive surgery without anaesthetics, 
and their effects on the body 
chemistry of the penitent were con- 
siderable. Large quantities of 
histamine and adrenalin were re- 
leased while the whip was actually 
being plied; and when the resulting 
wounds began to fester (as wounds 
practically always did before the. 
age of soap), various toxic sub-

stances, produced by the decom- 
position of protein, found their way 
into the bloodstream. But hista- 
mine produces shock, and shock 
affects the mind no less profoundly 
than the body. Moreover, large 
quantities of adrenalin may cause 
hallucinations, and some of the 
products of its decomposition are 
known to induce .symptoms re- 
sembling those of schizophrenia 
. In other words, when remorse, 
self-loathing, and the fear of hell 
release adrenalin, when self-in- 
flicted wounds release decomposed 
protein into the blood, the ef- 
ficiency of the cerebral reducing 
valve is lowered and unfamiliar 
aspects of Mind-at-Large (includ- 
ing psi phenomena, visions, and, if 
he is philosophically and ethically 
prepared . mystical experiences) 
will flow into the ascetic’s con- 
sciousness.” 

Remorse, self-loathing and the 
fear of hell. Fasting and prayer. 
Whips and chains. Festering 
wounds. As the power fades in me, 
as the sacred gift dies, I toy with 
the idea of trying to revive it by 
artificial means. Acid, mescalin, 
psilocybin? 1 don’t think I’d care to 
go there again. Mortification of the 
flesh? That seems obsolete to me, 
like marching off to the Crusades 
or wearing spats; something that 
simply isn’t appropriate for 1976. 
I doubt that I could get very deep 
into flagellation, anyway. What 
does that leave? Fasting and 
prayer? 1 could fast, 1 suppose. 



Prayer? To whom? To what? I’d 
feel like a fool. Dear God, give me 
my power again. Dear Moses 
please help me. Crap on that. Jews 
don’t pray for favors — they know 
nobody will answer. What’s left, 
then? Remorse, self-loathing and 
the fear of hell? 1 already have 
those three and they do me no 
good. We must try some other way 
of goading the power back to life. 
Invent something new. Flagellation 
of the mind, perhaps? Yes. I’ll try 
that. I’ll get out the metaphorical 
cudgels and let myself have it. 
Flagellation of the aching, weaken- 
ing, throbbing, dissolving mind. 
The treacherous, hateful mind. 

B ut why does David Selig want 
his power to come back? Why 
not let it fade? It’s always been a 
curse to him, hasn’t it? It’s cut 
him off from his fellow men and 
doomed him to a loveless life. 
Leave well enough alone, Duvid. 

Let it fade. Let it fade. On the j 
other hand, without the power, 1 
what are you? Without that one 
faltering unpredictable unsatis- 
factory means of contact with 
them, how will you be able to touch 
them at all? Your power joins you 
to mankind, for better or for worse, i 
in the only joining you have and ! 
you can’t bear to surrender it. i 
Admit it. You love it and you de- 
spise it, this gift of yours. You ’ 
dread losing it despite all it’s done ! 
to you. You’ll fight to cling to the i 
last shreds of it, even though you j

know the struggle is hopeless. Fight 
on, then. Read Huxley again. Try 
acid, if you dare. Try flagellation. 
Try fasting, at least. All right, fast- 
ing. I’ll skip the chow mein. I’ll 
skip the eggroll. Let’s slide a fresh 
sheet into the typewriter and think 
about Odysseus as a symbol of 
society.

H ark to the silvery jangle of 
the telephone. The hour is 
late. Who calls? Is it Aldous Hux- 
ley from beyond the grave, urging 
me to have courage? Dr. Hittner, 
with some important questions 
about making pee-pee? Sure. Sure. 
I stare at the telephone, clueless. 
My power even at its height was 
never equal to the task of pene- 
trating the consciousness of Ma 
Bell. 

At last, sighing, I pick up the 
receiver on the fifth ring and hear 
the sweet contralto voice of my 
sister Judith. 

“Am 1 interrupting something?” 
Typical Judith opening. 

“A quiet night at home. I’m 
ghosting a term paper on The Od- 
yssey." 

“You haven’t called in two 
weeks.” 

“I was broke. After that scene 
the last time I didn’t want to bring 
up the subject of money. And 
lately it’s been the only subject I 
can think of to talk about, so 1 
didn’t call.” 



“Crap,” she says. “I wasn’t 
angry at you.” 

“You sounded mad as hell.” 

“I didn’t mean any of that stuff. 
Why did you think I was serious? 
Just because I was yelling? Do you 
really believe that I regard you as — 
as — what did 1 call you?” 

“A shiftless sponger, I think.” 

“A shiftless sponger. Crap. I was 
tense that night, Duv, I had per- 
sonal problems and my period was 
coming on besides. 1 lost control. 
I was just shouting the first dumb 
thing that came into my head, but 
why did you believe I meant it? 
You of all people shouldn’t have 
thought 1 was serious. Since when 
do you take what people say with 
their mouths at face value?” 

“You were saying it with your 
head, too, Jude.” 

“I was?” Her voice is suddenly 
small and contrite. “Are you sure?” 
“It came through loud and clear.” 
“Oh, Jesus, Duv, have a heart! In 
the heat of the moment I could have 
been thinking anything. But under- 
neath the anger — underneath, Duv 
— you must have seen that I didn’t 
mean it. That I love you, that I 
don’t want to drive you away from 
me. You’re all I’ve got, Duv, you 
and the baby.” 

“I don’t read much of what’s 
underneath any more, Jude. Not 
much comes through these days. 
Anyway, look, it isn’t worth has- 
sling over. 1 am a shiftless 
sponger — and I have borrowed 
more from you than you can afford

to give. The black sheep big 
brother feels enough guilt as it 
is. I’m damned if I’m ever going to 
ask for money from you again.” 
“Guilt? You talk about guilt, 
when I — ” 

“No,” I warn her, “don’t you go 
on a guilt trip now, Jude. Not now.” 
“All right. All right. Are you 
okay now for money, though?” 

“I told you. I’m ghosting term 
papers. I’m getting by.” 

“Do you want to come over here 
for dinner tomorrow night?” 

“I think I’d better work instead. 
I’ve got a lot of papers to write, 
Jude. It’s the busy season.” 

“It would be just the two of us. 
And the kid, of course, but I’ll put 
him to sleep early. Just you and me. 
We could talk. We’ve got so much 
to talk about. Why don’t you come 
over, Duv? You don’t need to work 
all day and all night. I’ll cook up 
something you like.” She is plead- 
ing with me, this icy sister who 
gave me nothing but hatred for 
twenty-five years. Come over and 
I’ll be a mama for you, Duv. Come 
let me be loving, brother. 

“Maybe the night after next. 
I’ll call you.” 

“No chance for tomorrow?” 

“I don’t think so,” I say. There 
is silence. She doesn’t want to beg 
me. Into the sudden screeching 
silence I say, “What have you been 
doing with yourself, Judith? Seeing 
anyone interesting?” 

“Not seeing anyone at all.” A 
flinty edge to her voice. She is two 



and a half years into her divorce — 
she sleeps around a good deal and 
juices are souring in her soul. She 
is thirty-one years old. 

“What happened to that travel 
agent you were seeing? Mickey?” 

“Marty. That was just a gim- 
mick. He got me all over Europe 
for ten percent of the fare. I was 
using him.” 

“So?” 

“I felt cruddy about it. Last 
month I broke off. I wasn’t in love 
with him. I don’t think I even liked 
him.” 

“But you played around with 
him long enough to get a trip to 
Europe — first.” 

“It didn’t cost him anything, 
Duv. I had to go to bed with him — 
all he had to do was fill out a form. 
What are you saying anyway? That 
I’m a whore?” 

“Jude—” 

“Okay, I’m a whore. At least 
I’m trying to go straight for a 
while. Lots of fresh orange juice 
and plenty of serious reading. I’m 
reading Proust now, would you 
believe that? I just finished Swann’s 
Way and tomorrow — ” 

“I’ve still got some work to do 
tonight, Jude.” 

“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to 
intrude. Will you come for dinner 
this week?” 

“I’ll think about it. I’ll let you 
know.” 

“Why do you hate me so much, 
Duv?” 

“I don’t hate you. And we were

about to get off the phone, 1 think.” 
“Don’t forget to call,” she says. 
Clutching at straws.

T oni. I should tell you about 
Toni now. 

I lived with Toni for seven weeks, 
one summer eight years ago. That’s 
as long as I’ve ever lived with any- 
body, except my parents and my 
sister, whom I got away from as 
soon as I decently could, and my- 
self, whom I can’t get away from 
at all. Toni was one of the two great 
loves of my life, the other being 
Kitty. I’ll tell you about Kitty some 
other time. 

Can I reconstruct Toni? Let’s 
try it in a few swift strokes. She 
was twenty-four that year. A tall 
coltish girl, five feet six, five feet 
seven. Slender. Agile and awkward, 
both at once. Long legs, long arms, 
thin wrists, thin ankles. Glossy 
black hair, very straight, cascading 
to her shoulders. Quick brown 
eyes, warm, alert and quizzical. A 
witty, shrewd girl, not really well 
educated but extraordinarily wise. 
The face by no means convention- 
ally pretty — too much mouth, too 
much nose, the cheekbones too 
high — but producing a sexy and 
highly attractive effect, sufficient 
to make a lot of heads turn when 
she entered a room. 

I never looked into Toni’s mind 
except once on the very day I 
met her and once a couple of weeks 



after that, plus a third time on the 
day we broke up. The third time 
was a sheer disastrous accident. 
The second was more or less an 
accident, too, not quite. Only the 
first was a deliberate probe. After 
I realized I loved her I took care 
never to spy on her head. He who 
peeps through a hole may see what 
will vex him. A lesson I learned 
very young. Besides, I didn’t want 
Toni to suspect anything about my 
power. My curse. I was afraid it 
might frighten her away. 

That summer I was working as 
an eighty-five a week researcher, 
latest in my infinite series of odd 
jobs, for a well-known professional 
writer who was doing an immense 
book on the political machinations 
involved in the founding of the state 
of Israel. Eight hours a day I went 
through old newspaper files for him 
in the bowels of the Columbia li- 
brary. Toni was a junior editor for 
the publishing house that was 
bringing out his book. I met her 
one afternoon in late spring at his 
posh apartment on East End Ave- 
nue. I went there to deliver a bundle 
of notes on Harry Truman’s 1948 
campaign speeches and she hap- 
pened to be present. She was so 
beautiful it hurt me to look at her. 
I hadn’t been with a woman in 
months. I automatically assumed 
she was the writer’s mistress — 
screwing editors. I’m told, is 
standard practice on certain high 
levels of the literary profession — 
but my old peeping-tom instincts 



DYING INSIDE 



25 



quickly gave me the true scoop. 
I tossed a fast probe at him and 
found that his mind was a cesspool 
of frustrated longings for her. He 
ached for her and she had no yen 
for him at all, evidently. Next I 
poked into her mind. I sank in 
deep, finding myself in warm, 
rich loam. Quickly got oriented. 
Stray fragments of autobiography 
bombarded me, incoherent, non- 
linear: a divorce, some good sex 
and some bad sex, college days, 
a trip to the Caribbean, all 
swimming around in the usual 
chaotic way. 1 got past that fast 
and checked out what 1 was 
after. No, she wasn’t sleeping with 
the writer. Physically he registered 
absolute zero for her. (Odd. To 
me he seemed attractive, a roman- 
tic and appealing figure, as far as 
a drearily heterosexual soul like 
me is able to judge such things.) 
Then, still rummaging around, 1 
learned something much more 
surprising — I seemed to be turning 
her on. Forth from her came the 
explicit line: I wonder if he's free 
tonight. She looked upon the 
aging researcher, a venerable 
thirty-three and already going 
thin on top, and did not find him 
repellent. 1 was so shaken by that 
— her dark-eyed glamor, her 
leggy sexiness aimed at me — that 
I got the hell out of her head, fast. 
“Here’s the Truman stuff,” I said 
to my employer. We talked for a 
few minutes about the next assign- 
ment he had for me and then I 



made as though to leave. A quick 
guarded look at her. 

“Wait,” she said. “We can ride 
down together. I’m just about 
finished here.” 

In the elevator we stood apart, 
Toni in this corner, I in that one, 
with a quivering wall of tension 
and yearning separating and unit- 
ing us. I had to struggle to keep 
from reading her. I was afraid, 
terrified, not of getting the wrong 
answer but of getting the right one. 
In the street we stood apart also, 
dithering a moment. Finally I 
said I was getting a cab to take me 
to the Upper West Side — me, a 
cab, on eighty-five a week — and 
could I drop her off anywhere? 
She said she lived on 105th and 
West End. Close enough. When 
the cab stopped outside her place 
she invited me up for a drink. 
Three rooms, indifferently fur- 
nished: mostly books, records, 
scatter-rugs, posters. She went 
to pour some wine for us and I 
caught her and pulled her around 
and kissed her. She trembled 
against me — or was I the one who 
was trembling? 

O yER a bowl of hot-and-sour 
soup at the Great Shanghai, a 
little later that evening, she said 
she would be moving in a couple of 
days. The apartment belonged to 
her current roommate — male — 
with whom she had split up just 
three days before. She had no place 
to stay. “I’ve got only one lousy 



26 



GALAXY 



room,” I said, “but it has a double 
bed.” Shy grins, hers, mine. So she 
moved in. I didn’t think she was in 
love with me, not at all, but 1 wasn’t 
going to ask. If what she felt for me 
wasn’t love, it was good enough, 
the best I could hope for — and in 
the privacy of my own head I could 
feel love for her. She had needed a 
port in a storm. I had happened to 
offer one. If that was all I meant to 
her now, so be it. So be it. There 
was time for things to ripen. 

We slept very little, our first two 
weeks. Not that we were making 
love all the time, though there was 
a lot of that, but we talked- We 
were new to each other, which is 
the best time of any relationship — 
when there are whole pasts to share 
everything pours out and there’s no 
need to search for things to say. 
(Not quite everything poured out. 
The only thing I concealed from her 
was the central fact of my life, the 
fart that had shaped my every 
aspect.) She talked of her marriage 
— young, brief and empty — and of 
how she had lived in the three years 
since its ending — a succession of 
men, a dip into occultism and 
Reichian therapy, a newfound 
dedication to her editing career. 
Giddy weeks. 

Our third week brought my 
second peep into her mind. A swel- 
tering June night, a full moon send- 
ing cold illumination through the 
slatted blinds into our room. Her 
body, very pale, wore a white glow 
in the eerie darkness, her long lean 



form rearing above me. Her face 
half hidden in her own dangling 
unruly hair. Her eyes closed. Her 
lips slack. Her breasts, viewed from 
below, seemed even bigger than 
they really were. Cleopatra by 
moonlight. Her beauty and the 
strangeness of her so overwhelmed 
me that 1 could not resist watching 
her — watching on all levels— -and so 
1 opened the barrier that I had so 
scrupulously erected. My mind 
touched a curious finger to her soul 
and received the full uprushing 
volcanic intensity of her pleasure. 1 
found no thought of me in her mind. 
Only sheer animal frenzy, bursting 
from every nerve. I’ve seen that in 
other women, before and after 
Toni — as they reach that moment 
they are islands, alone in the void 
of space, aware only of their bodies. 
When pleasure takes them it is a 
curiously impersonal phenomenon, 
no matter how titanic its impact. 
So it was then with Toni. 1 didn’t 
object. 1 knew what to expect and I 
didn’t feel cheated or rejected. In 
fact my joining of souls with her at 
that awesome moment served to 
trigger and treble the intensity of 
my own pleasure. I lost contact 
with her then. Upheavals shattered 
the fragile telepathic link. After- 
ward I felt a little sleazy at having 
spied, but not overly guilty about 
it. How magical a thing it was, after 
all, to have been with her in that 
moment. To be aware of her joy not 
just as mindless spasms but as jolts 
of brilliant light flaring across the 



DYING INSIDE 



27 



dark terrain of her soul. An instant 
of beauty and wonder, an illumina- 
tion never to be forgotten. But 
never to be repeated, either. 1 re- 
solved once more to keep our rela- 
tionship clean and honest. To take 
no unfair advantage of her. To stay 
out of her head forever after. 

Despite which, I found myself 
some weeks later entering Toni’s 
consciousness a third time. By 
accident. By damnable abominable 
accident. Oy, that third time! 

That bummer — that disaster. 

That catastrophe. 

VII 

I N THE early spring of 1945, 
when he was ten years old, his 
loving mother and father got him a 
little sister. That was exactly how 
they phrased it — his mother, smil- 
ing her warmest phony smile, hug- 
ging him, telling him in her best 
this - is - how - we - talk - to - bright - 
children tone, “Dad and I have a 
wonderful surprise for you, Duvid. 
We’re going to get a little sister for 
you.” 

It was no surprise, of course. 
They had been discussing it among 
themselves for months, maybe for 
years, always making the fallacious 
assumption that their son, clever as 
he was, didn’t understand what 
they were talking about. And, 
naturally, he had been reading their 
minds. In those days the power was 
sharp and clear — lying in his bed- 
room, surrounded by his dog-eared 



books and his stamp albums, he 
could effortlessly tune in on every- 
thing that went on behind the closed 
door of theirs, fifty feet away. It 
was like an endless radio broadcast 
without commercials. They had no 
secrets from him. He had no shame 
about spying. Preternaturally adult, 
privy to all their privities, he medi- 
tated daily on the raw torrid stuff of 
married life — the financial anxi- 
eties, the moments of sweet undif- 
ferentiated lovingness, the moments 
of guiltily suppressed hatred for the 
wearisome eternal spouse, the 
copulatory joys and anguishes, the 
comings together and the fallings 
apart, the intense and terrifyingly 
single-minded concentration on the 
growth and proper development of 
The Child. Their minds poured 
forth a steady stream of rich yeasty 
foam and he lapped it all up. Read- 
ing their souls was his game, his 
toy, his religion, his revenge. They 
never suspected he was doing it. 
They didn’t dream his gift existed. 
They merely thought he was ab- 
normally intelligent and never 
questioned the means by which he 
learned so much about so many 
improbable things. 

He knew that Dr. Hittner — 
baffled, wholly out of his depth with 
the strange Selig child — believed it 
would be better for everyone if 
David had a sibling. That was the 
word he used, sibling, and David 
had to fish the meaning out of 
Hittner’s head as though out of a 
dictionary. Sibling; a brother or a 



28 



GALAXY 



sister. Oh, the treacherous horse- 
faced bastard! The one thing young 
David had asked Hittner not to 
suggest — and naturally he had 
suggested it. The desirability of 
siblings had been in Hittner’s mind 
all along, lying there like a grenade. 
David, picking his mother’s mind 
one night, had found the text of a 
letter from Hittner. The only child 
is an emotionally deprived child. 
Without the rough-and-tumble 
interplay with siblings he has no 
way of learning the best techniques 
of relating to his peers and he devel- 
ops a dangerously burdensome 
relation with his parents, for whom 
he becomes a companion instead 
of a dependent. Hittner’s universal 
panacea: lots of siblings. As though 
there were no neurotics in big 
families. 

David was aware of his parents’ 
frantic attempts at filling Hittner’s 
prescription. No time to waste — 
the boy grows older all the time, 
siblingless, lacking each day the 
means of learning the best tech- 
niques of relating to his peers. And 
so, night after night, the poor aging 
bodies of Paul and Martha Selig 
grapple with the problem. They 
force themselves sweatily onward 
to self-defeating prodigies of lust- 
fulness and each month the bad 
news comes in a rush of blood: 
there will be no sibling this time. 
But at last the seed takes root. 

They said nothing about that to 
him, ashamed, perhaps, to admit to 
an eight-year-old that such things 



as sexual intercourse occurred in 
their lives. But he knew. He knew 
why his mother’s belly was begin- 
ning to bulge and why they still 
hesitated to explain it to him. He 
knew, too, that his mother’s mys- 
terious “appendicitis” attack of 
July, 1944, was actually a mis- 
carriage. He knew why they both 
wore tragic faces for months after- 
ward. He knew that Martha’s 
doctor had told her that autumn 
that it really wasn’t wise for her to 
try for more babies, due to her 
condition — that if they were going 
to insist on a second child the best 
course was to adopt one. He knew 
his father’s traumatic response to 
that suggestion: What, bring into 
the household a bastard that some 
tramp threw away? Poor old Paul 
lay tossing awake every night for 
weeks, not even confessing to his 
wife why he was so upset, but un- 
knowingly spilling the whole thing 
to his nosy son. The insecurities, the 
irrational hostilities. Why do I have 
to raise a stranger’s brat, just be- 
cause this psychiatrist says it’ll do 
David some good? What kind of 
garbage will I be taking into the 
house? How can I love this child 
that isn’t mine? All this the all- 
perceiving David perceives. Finally 
the elder Selig voices his misgivings, 
carefully edited, to his wife, saying. 
Maybe Hittner’s wrong, maybe 
this is just a phase David’s going 
through and another child isn’t the 
right answer at all. Telling her to 
consider the expense, the changes

they’d have to make in their way of 
life — they’re not young, they’ve 
grown settled in their ways ... a 
child at this time of their lives, the 
getting up at four in the morning, 
the crying, the diapers. And David 
silently cheering his father on, be- 
cause who needs this intruder, this 
sibling, this enemy of the peace? 
But Martha tearfully fights back, 
quoting Hittner’s letter, reading 
key passages out of her extensive 
library on child psychology, offer- 
ing damning statistics on the inci- 
dence of neurosis, maladjustment, 
bed-wetting and homosexuality 
among only children. The old man 
yields by Christmas. Okay, okay, 
we'll adopt, but let’s not take just 
anything, hear? It’s got to be 
Jewish. 

W ’’INTRY weeks of touring the 
adoption agencies, pretending 
all the while to David that these 
trips to Manhattan are mere innoc- 
uous shopping excursions. He 
wasn’t fooled. How could anyone 
fool this omniscient child? He had 
only to look behind their foreheads 
to know that they were shopping 
for a sibling. His one comfort was 
the hope that they would fail to 
find one. This was still wartime — 
if you couldn’t buy a new car, 
maybe you couldn’t get siblings 
either. For many weeks that ap- 
peared to be the case. Not many 
babies were available, and those 
that were seemed to have some 
grave defect — insufficiently Jewish 



or too fragile-looking, too cranky 
or of the wrong sex. Some boys 
were available but Paul and Martha 
had decided to get David a little 
sister. Already that limited things 
considerably, since people tended 
not to give girls up for adoption as 
readily as they did boys, but one 
snowy night in March David de- 
tected an ominous note of satisfac- 
tion in the mind of his mother, 
newly returned from yet another 
shopping trip, and, looking more 
closely, he realized that the quest 
was over. She had found a lovely 
little girl, four months old. 

David wondered why Martha 
hadn’t brought the baby home with 
her that very afternoon, but several 
weeks of legal formalities lay ahead 
and April was well along before his 
mother finally announced, “Dad 
and 1 have a wonderful surprise for 
you, Duvid.” 

They named her Judith Hannah 
Selig. David hated her instantly. He 
had been afraid they were going to 
move her into his bedroom, but no, 
they set up her crib in their own 
room. Nevertheless, her crying 
filled the whole apartment night 
after night, unending raucous wails. 
It was incredible how much noise 
could come out of one small body. 
Paul and Martha spent practically 
all their time feeding her or playing 
with her or changing her diapers 
and David didn’t mind that very 
much. It kept them busy and took 
some of the pressure off him. But 
he loathed having Judith around.

He saw nothing cute about her 
pudgy limbs and curly hair and 
dimpled cheeks. Watching her 
while she was being changed, he 
found some academic interest in 
observing her little pink slit, so 
alien to his experience, but once he 
had seen it his curiosity was as- 
suaged. In general she was an 
irritating distraction. He couldn’t 
read properly because of the noise 
she made, and reading was his one 
pleasure. The apartment was 
always full of relatives or friends, 
paying ceremonial visits to the new 
baby, and their stupid conventional 
minds flooded the place with blunt 
thoughts that impinged like mallets 
on David’s vulnerable conscious- 
ness. Now and then he tried to read 
the baby’s mind, but there was 
nothing in it except vague blurry 
formless globs of cloudy sensation 
— he had had more rewarding in- 
sights reading the minds of dogs 
and cats. She didn’t appear to have 
any thoughts. All he could pick up 
were feelings of hunger, of drowsi- 
ness and of dim orgasmic release as 
she wet her diaper. 

About ten days after she arrived 
he decided to try to kill her tele- 
pathically. While his parents were 
busy elsewhere he went to their 
room, peered into his sister’s 
bassinet and concentrated as hard 
as he could on draining her un- 
formed mind out of her skull. If 
only he could manage somehow to 
suck the spark of intellect from her, 
to draw her consciousness into 



himself, to transform her into an 
empty mindless shell, she would 
surely die. He sought to sink his 
hooks into her soul. He stared into 
her eyes and opened his power wide, 
taking her entire feeble output and 
pulling for more. Come .... come 
. your mind is sliding toward 
me .... I'm getting it, I'm getting 
all of it ... zam! I have your whole 
mind! Unmoved by his conjura- 
tions, she continued to gurgle and 
wave her arms about. He stared 
more intensely, redoubling the 
vigor of his concentration. Her 
smile wavered and vanished. Her 
brows puckered into a frown. Did 
she know he was attacking her or 
was she merely bothered by the 
faces he was making? Come .... 
come .... your mind is sliding 
toward me. 

For a moment he thought he 
might actually succeed. But then 
she shot him a look of frosty malev- 
olence, incredibly fierce, truly 
terrifying coming from an infant, 
and he backed away, frightened, 
fearing some sudden counterattack. 
An instant later she was gurgling 
again. She had defeated him. He 
went on hating her, but he never 
again tried to harm her. She, by the 
time she was old enough to know 
what the concept of hatred meant, 
was well aware of how her brother 
felt about her. And she hated back. 
She proved to be a far more effi- 
cient hater than he was. Oh, was 
she ever a first-class expert at 
hating!

T he subject of this composition 
is My Very First Acid Trip. 
My first and my last, eight years 
ago. Actually it wasn’t my trip at 
all, but Toni’s. D-lysergic acid 
diethylamide has never passed 
through my digestive tract. What 1 
did was hitchhike on Toni’s trip. 
Let me tell you. 

This happened in the summer of 
’68. That summer was a bad trip all 
in itself. Do you remember ’68 at 
all? That was the year we all awoke 
to the fact that the whole business 
was coming apart. I mean Ameri- 
can society. That pervasive feeling 
of decay and imminent collapse, so 
familiar to us all — it really dates 
from ’68, I think. When the world 
around us became a metaphor for 
the process of violent entropic 
collapse that had been going on 
inside our souls — inside my soul, 
at any rate — for some time. 

That summer Lyndon Baines 
Johnson was in the White House, 
just barely, serving out his time 
after his abdication in March. 
Bobby Kennedy had finally met 
the bullet with his name on it and 
so had Martin Luther King. It was 
the year of sideburns and Buffalo 
Bill mustachios. Babies were dying 
of malnutrition in a place called 
Biafra, which you don’t remember, 
and the Russians were moving 
troops into Czechoslovakia in yet 
another demonstration of socialist 
brotherhood. In a place called 



Vietnam, which you probably wish 
you didn’t remember either, we 
were dumping napalm on every- 
thing in sight for the sake of promo- 
ting peace and democracy, and a 
lieutenant named William Galley 
had recently coordinated the liqui- 
dation of 100-odd sinister and 
dangerous old men, women and 
children at the town of Mylai, only 
we didn’t know anything about that 
yet. Let’s see, what else? President 
Johnson nominated Abe Fortas to 
replace Earl Warren as Chief Jus- 
tice of the Supreme Court. Where 
are you now. Chief Justice Fortas, 
when we need you? The Paris peace 
talks, believe it or not, had just 
begun that summer. In later years 
it came to seem that the talks had 
been going on since the beginning 
of time, as eternal and everlasting 
as the Grand Canyon and the Re- 
publican Party, but no, they were 
invented in 1968. That was the sort 
of year it was. Oh, Christ, I’ve for- 
gotten one significant chunk of 
history. In the spring of ’68 we had 
the riots at Columbia, with radical 
students occupying the campus and 
classes being suspended and final 
exams called off and nightly con- 
frontations with the police. How 
funny it is that I pushed that event 
out of my mind, when of all the 
things I’ve listed here it was the 
only one 1 actually experienced at 
first hand. Standing at Broadway 
and 116th Street watching platoons 
of cold-eyed fuzz go racing toward 
Butler Library. Holding my hand

aloft in the forked V-for-peace 
gesture and screaming idiotic 
slogans with the best of them. 
Cowering in the lobby of Furnald 
Hall as the blue-clad nightstick 
brigade went on its rampage. De- 
bating tactics with a ragged-bearded 
SDS gauleiter who finally spat in 
my face and called me a stinking 
liberal fink. Watching a group of 
young shaggy Columbia men rit- 
ualistically pissing on a pile of 
research documents that had been 
liberated from the filing cabinet 
of some hapless instructor going 
for his doctorate. It was then that 
I knew there could be no hope for 
mankind, when even the best of us 
were capable of going berserk in 
the cause of love and peace and 
human equality. On those dark 
nights I looked into many minds 
and found only hysteria and mad- 
ness. Once, in despair, realizing I 
was living in a world where two 
factions of lunatics were battling 
for control of the asylum, I went 
off to vomit in Riverside Park after 
a particularly bloody riot and was 
caught unawares (me, caught un- 
awares!) by a lithe 14-year-old 
black mugger who smilingly re- 
lieved me of twenty-two dollars. 

I was living near Columbia in ’68, 
in a seedy residence hotel on 1 14th 
Street, where I had one medium- 
big room plus kitchen and bath- 
room privileges. It was cheap — 
fourteen-fifty a week — and 1 had to 
^ close to the University because 
of the work I was doing, research- 



ing that Israel book. Are you still 
following me? I was telling you 
about my first acid trip, which was 
really Toni’s trip. 

W E HAD shared our shabby 
room nearly seven weeks — a 
bit of May, all of June, some of 
July - through thick and thin, heat 
waves and rainstorms, misunder- 
standings and reconciliations, and 
it had been a happy time, perhaps 
the happiest of my life. I loved her 
and I think she loved me. I haven't 
had much love in my life. That 
isn’t intended as a grab for your 
pity, just as a simple statement of 
fact, objective and cool. The nature 
of my condition diminishes my 
capacity to love and be loved. A 
man in my circumstances, wide 
open to everyone’s innermost 
thoughts, really isn’t going to 
experience a great deal of love. 
He is poor at giving love because 
he doesn’t much trust his fellow 
human beings — he knows too many 
of their dirty little secrets and that 
kills his feelings for them. Unable 
to give, he cannot get. His soul, 
hardened by isolation and ungiving- 
ness, becomes inaccessible and it is 
not easy for others to love him. The 
loop closes upon itself and he is 
trapped within. Nevertheless I 
loved Toni, having taken special 
care not to see too deeply into her, 
and I didn’t doubt my love was 
returned. 

On the Friday of our seventh 
week Toni came home from her 



dying inside

office with two small squares of 
white blotting paper in her purse. 
In the center of each square was a 
faint blue-green stain. I studied 
them a moment or two without 
comprehending. 

“Acid,” she said finally. 

“Acid?” 

“You know. LSD. Teddy gave 
them to me.” 

Teddy was her boss, the editor- 
in-chief. LSD, yes. I knew. I had 
read Huxley on mescalin in 1957. 
I was fascinated and tempted. For 
years 1 had flirted with the psy- 
chedelic experience, even once 
attempting to volunteer for an LSD 
research program at the Columbia 
Medical Center, I was too late 
signing up, though. And then, as 
the drug became a fad, came all the 
horror stories of suicides, psy- 
choses, bad trips. Knowing my 
vulnerabilities, I decided it was 
the part of wisdom to leave acid to 
others, though I was still curious 
about it. And now these squares of 
blotting paper sitting in the palm 
of Toni’s hand. 

“It’s supposed to be dynamite 
stuff,” she said. “Absolutely pure, 
laboratory quality. Teddy’s already 
tripped on a tab from this batch 
and he says it’s very smooth, very 
clean, no speed in it or any crap 
like that. 1 thought we could spend 
tomorrow tripping and sleep it off 
on Sunday.” 

“Both of us?” 

“Why not?” 

“Do you think it’s safe for both 



of us to be out of our minds at the 
same time?” 

She gave me a peculiar look. 
“Do you think acid drives you out 
of your mind?” 

“I don’t know. I’ve heard a lot 
of scary stories.” 

“You’ve never tripped?” 

“No,” I said. “Have you?” 
“Well, no. But I’ve watched 
friends of mine while they were 
tripping.” 1 felt a pang at this 
reminder of the life she had led 
before 1 met her, “They don’t go 
out of their minds, David. There’s 
a kind of wild high for an hour or 
so when things sometimes get 
jumbled up, but basically somebody 
who’s tripping sits there as lucid 
and as calm as — well, Aldous Hux- 
ley. Can you imagine Huxley out of 
his mind? Gibbering and drooling 
and smashing furniture?” She 
sounded impatient with me. There 
was a patronizing, lecturing tone 
in her voice. Her esteem for me 
seemed clearly diminished by these 
old-maid hesitations of mine— we 
were on the threshold of a real rift. 
“What’s the matter, David? Are 
you afraid to trip?” 

“1 think it’s unwise for both of 
us to trip at once, that’s all. When 
we aren’t sure where the stuff is 
going to take us.” 

“Tripping together is the most 
loving thing two people can do.” 
“But it’s a risky thing. We just 
don’t know. Look, you can get 
more acid if you want it, can’t 
you?”

“1 suppose so.” 

“Okay, then. Let’s do this thing 
in an orderly way, one step at a 
time. There’s no hurry. You trip 
tomorrow and I’ll watch. I’ll trip 
on Sunday and you’ll watch. If we 
both like what the acid does to our 
heads, we can trip together next 
time. All right, Toni? All right?” 
“All right,” she said softly. “It 
isn’t worth a hassle.” 

S ATURDAY morning she 

skipped breakfast — she had 
been told to trip on an empty 
stomach — and after I had eaten 
we sat for a time in the kitchen with 
one of the squares of blotting paper 
lying innocently on the table be- 
tween us. There wasn’t much con- 
versation. She filled an ash tray 
with a great dismal mound of half- 
smoked cigarettes. From time to 
time she grinned nervously. From 
time to time I took her hand and 
smiled encouragingly. During this 
touching scene various of the 
tenants with whom we shared the 
kitchen on this floor of the hotel 
drifted in and out. First Eloise, 
the sleek black hooker. Then Miss 
Theotokis, the grim-faced nurse 
who worked at St. Luke’s. Mr. 
Wong, the mysterious little roly- 
poly Chinese who always walked 
around in his underwear. Aitken, 
the scholarly fag from Toledo, and 
his cadaverous mainlining room- 
mate, Donaldson. A couple of them 
nodded to us but no one actually 
said anything, not even “Good 



morning.” In this place it was 
proper to behave as though your 
neighbors were invisible. The fine 
old New York tradition. About 
half-past ten in the morning Toni 
said, “Get me some orange juice, 
will you?” Giving me a wink and a 
broad toothy smile, all false bra- 
vado, she wadded up the blotting 
paper and pushed it into her mouth, 
bolting it and gulping the orange 
juice as a chaser. 

“Flow long will it take to hit?” 
I asked. 

“About an hour and a half,” she 
said. 

In fact it was more like fifty 
minutes. We were back in our own 
room, the door locked, faint 
scratchy sounds of Bach coming 
from the portable phonograph. She 
looked up suddenly and said, “I’m 
starting to feel a little funny.” 

“Funny how?” 

“Dizzy. A slight touch of 
nausea. There’s a prickling at the 
back of my neck.” 

“Can I get you anything? Glass 
of water? Juice?” 

“Nothing, thanks. I’m fine. 
Really I am.” A smile, timid but 
genuine. She seemed a little 
apprehensive but not at all 
frightened. Eager for the voyage. 
I put down my book and watched 
her vigilantly, feeling protective, 
almost wishing that I’d have some 
occasion to be of service to her. I 
didn’t want her to have a bad trip 
but I wanted her to need me. 

She gave me bulletins on the

progress of the acid through her 
nervous system. Visual effects 
were beginning. The walls looked 
a trifle concave to her and the flaws 
in the plaster were taking on extra- 
ordinary texture and complexity. 
The color of everything was un- 
naturally bright. The shafts of 
sunlight coming through the dirty 
window were prismatic, shattering 
and spewing pieces of the spectrum 
over the floor. The music — I had a 
stack of her favorite records on the 
changer — had acquired a curious 
new intensity. She was having 
difficulty following melodic lines 
and it seemed to her that the turn- 
table kept stopping and starting, 
but the sound itself, as sound, had 
some indescribable quality of 
density and tangibility that fasci- 
nated her. There was a whistling 
sound in her ears, too, as of air 
rushing past her cheeks. She spoke 
of a pervading sense of strange- 
ness — “I’m on some other planet,” 
she said twice. She looked flushed, 
excited, happy. Remembering the 
terrible tales 1 had heard of acid- 
induced descents into hell, har- 
rowing accounts of grueling 
bummers lovingly recounted for 
the delight of the millions by the 
diligent anonymous journalists of 
Time and Life, I nearly wept in 
relief at this evidence that my Toni 
would come through her journey 
unscathed. I had feared the worst. 
But she was making out all right. 
Her eyes were closed. Her face was 
serene and exultant, her breathing 



deep and relaxed. Lost in transcen- 
dental realms of mystery was my 
Toni. She was barely speaking to 
me now, breaking her silences only 
every few minutes to murmur 
something indistinct and oblique. 
Half an hour had passed since she 
first had reported strange sensa- 
tions. As she drifted deeper into 
her trip my love for her grew 
deeper also. Her ability to cope 
with acid was proof of the basic 
toughness of her personality and 
that delighted me. I admire capable 
women. Already I was planning 
my own trip for the next day — 
selecting the musical accompani- 
ment, trying to imagine the sort 
of interesting distortions of reality 
I would experience, looking for- 
ward to comparing notes with Toni 
afterward. I was regretting the 
cowardice that had deprived me of 
the pleasure of tripping with Toni 
this day. 

B ut what is this, now? What’s 
happening to my head? Why 
this sudden feeling of suffocation? 
The pounding in my chest? The 
dryness in my throat? The walls 
are flexing — the air seems close 
and heavy— my right arm is 
suddenly a foot longer than the 
left one. These are effects Toni 
had noticed and described a little 
while ago. Why do I feel them now? 
I tremble. Muscles leap about of 
their own accord in my thighs. Is 
this what they call a contact high? 
Merely being so close to Toni while

she trips — did she breathe particles 
of LSD at me? Have 1 inadvertently 
turned on through some contagion 
of the atmosphere? 

“My dear Selig,” says my arm- 
chair smugly, “how can you be so 
foolish? Obviously you’re picking 
these phenomena right out of her 
mind!” 

Obviously? Is it so obvious? 1 
consider the possibility. Am 1 
reading Toni without knowing it? 
Apparently I am. In the past some 
effort of concentration, however 
slight, had always been necessary 
in order for me to manage a fine- 
focus peep into another head. But 
it seems that the acid must inten- 
sify her outputs and bring them to 
me unsolicited. What other explan- 
ation can there be? She is broad- 
casting her trip and somehow 1 
have tuned to her wavelength. And 
now the acid’s strangenesses, 
spreading across the gap between 
us, infect me as welt. 

Shall I get out of her mind? 

The acid effects distract me. I 
look at Toni and she seems trans- 
formed. A small dark mole on her 
lower cheek, near the corner of her 
mouth, flashes a vortex of blazing 
color: red, blue, violet, green. Her 
lips are too full, her mouth too 
wide. All those teeth. Row upon 
row upon row, like a shark’s. Why 
have 1 never noticed that predatory 
mouth before? She frightens me. 
Her neck elongates; her body com- 
presses; her breasts move about 
like restless cats beneath her 



familiar red sweater, which itself 
has taken on an ominous, threaten- 
ing purplish tinge. To escape her I 
glance toward the window. A 
pattern of cracks that I have never 
been aware of before runs through 
the soiled panes. In a moment, 
surely, the shattered window will 
implode and shower us with fiery 
fragments of glass. The building 
across the street is unnaturally 
squat today. There is menace in its 
altered form. The ceiling is coming 
toward me, too. I hear muffled 
drumbeats overhead — the footsteps 
of my upstairs neighbor, I tell 
myself — and 1 imagine cannibals 
preparing their dinner. 

I should turn this off, before it 
freaks me altogether. I want out. 

Well, easily done. I have my ways 
of stopping down the inputs, of 
blocking the flow. Only they don’t 
work this time. I am helpless before 
the power of the acid. I try to shut 
myself away from these unfamiliar 
and unsettling sensations and they 
march into me all the same. I am 
wide open to everything emanating 
from Toni. 1 am caught up in it. 
I go deeper and deeper. This is a 
trip. This is a bad trip. This is a 
very bad trip. How odd — Toni was 
having a good trip, wasn’t she? 
Then why do 1, accidentally hitch- 
hiking on her trip, find myself 
having a bad one? 

Whatever is in Toni’s mind floods 
into mine. Receiving another’s 
soul is no new experience for me, 
but this is a transfer such as I have 



dying inside 



37 



never had before, for the informa- 
tion, modulated by the drug, comes 
to me in ghastly distortions. I am 
an unvk'illing spectator in Toni’s 
soul and what 1 see is a feast of 
demons. Can such darkness really 
live within her? 1 saw nothing like 
this those other two times — has the 
acid released some level of night- 
mare not accessible to me before? 
Her past is on parade. Gaudy 
images, bathed in a lurid light. 
Lovers. Copulations. Abomina- 
tions. Where am I? Where am I? 
Ah, there — off to one side, insig- 
nificant, irrelevant. Is that thing 
me? Is that how she really sees me? 
A hairy vampire bat, a crouching 
huddled bloodsucker? Or is that 
merely David Selig’s own image 
of David Selig, bouncing between 
us like the reflections in a barber 
shop’s parallel mirrors? God help 
me, am I laying my own bad trip 
on her, then reading it back from 
her and blaming her for harboring 
nightmares not of her own making? 

How can I break this link? 

I stumble to my feet. Staggering, 
splay-footed, nauseated. The room 
whirls. Where is the door? The 
doorknob retreats from me. I 
lunge for it. 

“David?” Her voice reverberates 
unendingly. “David David David 
David David David — ” 

“Some fresh air,” I mutter. 
“Just stepping outside a minute — ” 

It does no good. The nightmare 
images pursue me through the 
door. I lean against the sweating 



wall, clinging to a flickering sconce. 
The Chinaman drifts by me as 
though a ghost. Far away I hear 
the telephone ringing. The re- ] 
frigerator door slams and slams 
again and slams again and the 
Chinaman goes by me a second 
time from the same direction and ' 
the doorknob retreats from me as 
the universe folds back upon itself, 
locking me into a looped moment. 
Entropy decreases. The green wall . 
sweats green blood. A voice like ; 
thistles says, “Selig? Is something ■ 
wrong?” It’s Donaldson, the 
junkie. His face is a skull’s face. 
His hand on my shoulder is all 
bones. “Are you sick?” he asks. I 
shake my head. He leans toward 
me until his empty eye sockets are i 
inches from my face and studies me ! 
a long moment. He says, “You’re 
tripping, man! Isn’t that right? 
Listen, if you’re freaking out come 
on down the hall — we’ve got some ^ 
stuff that might help you.” ‘ 

“No. No problem.” 

I go lurching into my room. The 
door, suddenly flexible, will not; 
close; I push it with both hands, 
holding it in place until the latch 
clicks. Toni is sitting where I left 
her. She looks baffled. Her face is a 
monstrous thing, pure Picasso. 1 
turn away from her, dismayed. 
“David?” 

i 

H er voice is cracked andj 
harsh and seems to be pitched 
in two octaves at once, with a'

the top tone and the bottom. I 
wave my hands frantically, trying 
to get her to stop talking, but she 
goes on, expressing concern for me, 
wanting to know what’s happening, 
why I’ve been running in and out 
of the room. Every sound she 
makes is torment for me. Nor do 
the images cease to flow from her 
mind to mine. That shaggy toothy 
bat, wearing my face, still glowers 
in a corner of her skull. Toni, 1 
thought you loved me. Toni, I 
thought I made you happy. I drop 
to my knees and explore the dirt- 
encrusted carpet, a million years 
old, a faded thinning threadbare 
piece of the Pleistocene. She comes 
to me, bending down solicitously, 
she who is tripping looking after 
the welfare of her untripping 
companion, who mysteriously is 
tripping also. “I don’t under- 
stand,” she whispers. “You’re cry- 
ing, David. Your face is all blotchy. 
Did I say something wrong? Please 
don’t carry on, David. 1 was hav- 
ing such a good trip and now — I 
just don’t understand — ” 

The bat. The bat. Spreading its 
rubbery wings. Baring its yellow 
fangs. 

Biting. Sucking. Drinking. 

I choke out a few words: “I’m — 
tripping — too — ” 

My face pushed against the 
carpet. The smell of dust in my 
dry nostrils. Trilobites crawling 
through my brain. A bat crawling 
through hers. Shrill laughter in the 
hallway. The telephone. The re- 



frigerator door: slam, slam, slam! 
The cannibals dancing upstairs. 
The ceiling pressing against my 
back. My hungry mind looting 
Toni’s soul. He who peeps through 
a hole may see what will vex him. 
Toni says, “You took the other 
acid? When?” 

“I didn’t.” 

“Then how can you be tripping?” 

1 make no reply. 1 crouch, 1 
huddle, I sweat, I moan. This is 
the descent into hell. Huxley 
warned me. 1 didn’t want Toni’s 
trip. I didn’t ask to see any of this. 
My defenses are destroyed now. 
She overwhelms me. She engulfs 
me. 

Toni says, “Are you reading my 
mind, David?” 

“Yes.” The miserable ultimate 
confession. “I’m reading your 
mind.” 

“What did you say?” 

“I said I’m reading your mind. I 
can see every thought. Every ex- 
perience. I see myself the way you 
see me. Oh, Christ, Toni, Toni, 
Toni, it’s so awful!” 

She tugs at me and tries to pull 
me up to look at her. Finally I 
rise. Her face is horribly pale. Her 
eyes are rigid. She asks for clarifi- 
cation. What’s this about reading 
minds? Did I really say it, or is it 
something her acid-blurred mind 
invented? I really said it, I tell 
her. You asked me if I was reading 
your mind and I said yes, 1 was. 

“I never asked any such thing,” 
she says.

“I heard you ask it.” 

“But I didn’t — ” Trembling, 
now. Both of us. Her voice is 
bleak. “You’re trying to bum-trip 
me, aren’t you, David? I don’t 
understand. Why would you want 
to hurt me? Why are you messing 
me up? It was a good trip. It was a 
good trip. ” 

“Not for me,” I say. 

“You weren’t tripping.” 

“But I was.” 

She gives me a look of total in- 
comprehension and pulls away 
from me and throws herself on the 
bed, sobbing. Out of her mind, 
cutting through the grotesqueries 
of the acid images, comes a blast 
of raw emotion — fear, resentment, 
pain, anger. She thinks I’ve de- 
liberately tried to injure her. 
Nothing I can say now will repair 
things. Nothing can ever repair 
things. She despises me. 1 am a 
vampire to her, a bloodsucker, a 
leech — she knows my gift for what 
it is. We have crossed some fatal 
threshold and she will never again 
think of me without anguish and 
shame. Nor 1 of her. I rush from 
the room, down the hall to the 
room shared by Donaldson and 
Aitken. “Bad trip,” I mutter. 
“Sorry to trouble you, but — ” 

I STAYED with them the rest 
of the afternoon. They gave me 
a tranquilizer and brought me 
gently through the downslope of 
the trip. The psychedelic images 
still came to me out of Toni for 



half an hour or so, as though an 
inexorable umbilical chain linked 
us across all the length of the hall- 
way. But then to my relief the 
sense of contact began to slip and 
fade and suddenly, with a kind of 
audible click at the moment of 
severance, it was gone altogether. 
The flamboyant phantoms ceased 
to vex my soul. Color and dimen- 
sion and texture returned to their 
proper states. And at last I was 
free from that merciless reflected 
self-image. Once I was fully alone 
in my own skull again 1 felt like 
weeping to celebrate my deliver- 
ance, but no tears would come and 
I sat passively, sipping a Bromo. 
Time trickled away. Eventually 
I felt better. Shortly before six 
o’clock I went back to my room. 
Toni was not there. The place 
seemed oddly altered. Books were 
gone from the shelves, prints 
from the walls. The closet door 
stood open and half the things in 
it were missing. In my befuddled, 
fatigued state it took me a moment 
or two to grasp what had happened. 
At first I imagined burglary, ab- 
duction, but then I saw the truth. 
She had moved out.

looking, cluttered by sad, heavy, 
low-hanging clouds. Yesterday 
it rained, skinning yellow leaves 
from the trees, and now they lie 
pasted to the pavement of College 
Walk, their tips fluttering raggedly 
in the harsh breeze. There are 
puddles everywhere. As I settle 
down beside Alma Mater’s mas- 
sive green form I primly spread 
newspaper sheets, selected por- 
tions of today’s issue of The 
Columbia Daily Spectator, over 
the cold damp stone steps. Twenty- 
odd years ago, when I was a fool- 
ishly ambitious sophomore dream- 
ing of a career in journalism — how 
sly, a reporter who reads minds! — 
Spec seemed central to my life. 
Now it serves only for keeping my 
rump dry. 

Here I sit. Office hours. On my 
knees rests a thick manila folder, 
held closed by a big rubber band. 
Within, neatly typed, are five term 
papers, the products of my busy 
week. The Novels of Kafka. 
Shaw as Tragedian. The Concept 
of Synthetic A Priori Statements. 
Odysseus as a Symbol of Society. 
Aeschylus and the Aristotelian 
Tragedy. This is the day appointed 
for delivering the goods and, 
perhaps, picking up some new 
assignments. Five minutes to 
eleven. My clients will be arriving 
soon. Meanwhile I scan the passing 
parade. Students hurrying by, 
clutching mounds of books. Hair 
rippling in the wind, breasts 
hobbling. They all look frighten- 



ingly young to me, even the bearded 
ones. 

To divert myself I try to touch 
the minds of passersby and learn 
what 1 can learn. Playing my old 
game, my only game. Selig the 
voyeur, the soul-vampire, ripping 
off the intimacies of innocent 
strangers to cheer his chilly heart. 
But no — my head is full of cotton 
today. Only muffled murmurs 
come to me, indistinct, content- 
free. No discrete words, no flashes 
of identity, no visions of soul’s 
essence. This is one of the bad 
days. All inputs converge into 
unintelligibility — each bit of infor- 
mation is identical to all others. 
It is the triumph of entropy. I am 
reminded of Forster’s Mrs. 
Moore, listening tensely for revela- 
tion in the echoing Marabar caves 
and hearing only the same monot- 
onous noise, the same meaningless 
all-dissolving sound: Bourn. The 
sum and essence of mankind’s 
earnest strivings: Bourn. The minds 
flashing past me on College Walk 
now give me only: Bourn. Perhaps 
it is all I deserve. Love, fear, 
faith, churlishness, hunger, self- 
satisfaction, every species of 
interior monolog, all come to me 
with identical content. Bourn. 
I must work to correct this. It is 
not too late to wage war against 
entropy. Gradually, sweating, 
struggling, scrabbling for solid 
purchase, I widen the aperture, 
coaxing my perceptions to function. 
Yes. Yes. Come back to life. Get

it up, you miserable spy! Give me 
my fix! Within me the power stirs. 
The inner murk clears a bit — stray 
scraps of isolated but coherent 
thought find their way into me. 
This scratchy chaotic chatter tells 
me nothing except that the power 
is not yet dead and I take comfort 
enough in that. 1 visualize the 
power as a sort of worm wrapped 
around my cerebrum, a poor 
tired worm, wrinkled and shrunken, 
its once-glossy skin now ulcerous 
with shabby, flaking patches. That 
is a relatively recent image, but 
even in happier days I always 
thought of the gift as something 
apart from myself, something 
intrusive. An inhabitant. It and me, 
me and it. 1 used to discuss such 
things with Nyquist. (A person I 
once knew, a certain Tom Nyquist, 
a former friend of mine. Who car- 
ried a somewhat similar intruder 
within his skull.) Nyquist didn’t 
like my outlook. “That’s schizoid, 
man, setting up a duality like that. 
Your power is you. You are your 
power. Why try to alienate your- 
self from your own brain?” 
Probably Nyquist was right, but 
it’s much too late. It and me is how 
it will be, till death do us part. 

H ere is my client, the bulky 
halfback, Paul F. Bruno. 
His face is swollen and purpled 
and he is unsmiling, as though 
Saturday’s heroics have cost him 
some teeth. I flip down the rubber 
band, extract The Novels of 



Kafka and offer the paper to him. 
“Six pages,” 1 say. He has given 
me a ten-dollar advance. “You 
owe me another eleven bucks. Do 
you want to read it first?” 

“How good it it?” 

“You won’t be sorry.” 

“I’ll take your word for it.” He 
manages a painful, closemouthed 
grin. Pulling forth his thick 
wallet, he crosses my palm with 
greenbacks. I pocket his money. 
He favors me with a curt nod 
and tucks The Novels of Kafka 
under his immense forearm. 
Hastily, in shame, he goes hustling 
down the steps and off in the 
direction of Hamilton Hall. I 
watch his broad retreating back. 
A sudden gust of malevolent wind, 
rising off the Hudson, comes 
knifing eastward and cuts me 
bone-deep. 

Bruno has paused at the sundial, 
where a slender black student 
close to seven feet tall his inter- 
cepted him. A basketball player, 
obviously. The black wears a blue 
varsity jacket, green sneakers and 
tight tubular yellow slacks. His 
legs alone seem five feet long. He 
and Bruno talk for a moment. 
Bruno points toward me. The 
black nods. I am about to gain a 
new client, I realize. Bruno 
vanishes and the black trots 
springlegged across the walk, up 
the steps. He is very dark, almost 
purple-skinned, yet his features 
have a Caucasian sharpness, fierce 
cheekbones, proud aquiline nose.

thin frosty lips. He is formidably 
handsome, some kind of walking 
statuary. He wears his mid- 
night mass of kinky hair in a vast 
aggressive Afro halo a foot in 
diameter or more, fastidiously 
trimmed. 1 would not have been 
surprised by scarified cheeks, a 
bone through the nostrils. As he 
nears me my mind, barely slit-wide, 
picks up peripheral generalized 
emanations of his personality. 
Everything is predictable, even 
stereotyped — I expect him to be 
touchy, cocky, defensive, hostile, 
and what comes to me is a bouil- 
labaisse of ferocious racial pride, 
overwhelming physical self-satis- 
faction, explosive mistrust of 
others — especially whites. All right. 
Familiar patterns. 

His elongated shadow falls 
suddenly upon me as the sun 
momentarily pierces the clouds. 
He sways bouncily on the balls of 
his feet. “Your name Selig?” he 
asks. I nod. “Yahya Lumumba,” 
he says. 

“Pardon me?” 

"Yahya Lumumba." His eyes, 
glossy white against glossy purple, 
blaze with fury. From the impa- 
tience of his tone I realize that he 
is telling me his name, or at least 
the name he prefers to use. His 
tone indicates also that he assumes 
it’s a name everyone on this 
campus will recognize. Well, what 
would I know of college basketball 
stars? He says, “I hear you do term 
papers, man.” 



“That’s right.” 

“You got a good recommend 
from my pal Bruno there. How 
much you charge?” 

“Three-fifty a page. Typed, 
double-spaced.” 

He considers it. He shows many 
teeth and says, “What kind of 
rip-off is that?” 

“It’s how I earn my living, Mr. 
Lumumba.” I hate myself for 
that toadying, cowardly mister. 
“That’s about twenty dollars for 
an average-length paper. A decent 
job takes a fair amount of time, 
right?” 

“Yeah. Yeah.” An elaborate 
shrug. “Okay, I’m not hassling 
you, man. 1 got need for your 
work. You know anything about 
Europydes?” 

“Euripides?” 

“That’s what I said.” He’s bait- 
ing me, coming on with exag- 
gerated black mannerisms, talking 
watermelon-nigger at me with his 
Europydes. “That Greek cat who 
wrote plays.” 

“I know who you mean. What 
sort of paper do you need, Mr. 
Lumumba?” 

He pulls a scrap of a notebook 
sheet from a breast pocket and 
makes a great show of consulting it. 
“The prof he want us to compare 
the ‘Electra’ theme in Europydes, 
Sophocles and Eesk — Aysk — ” 

“Aeschylus?” 

“Him, yeah. Five to ten pages. 
It due by November ten. Can you 
swing it?”

<< T THINK so,” I say, reaching 
A for my pen. “It shouldn’t be 
any trouble at all. I’ll need some 
information about you for the 
heading. Exact spelling of your 
name, the name of your professor, 
the course number — ” He starts to 
tell me these things. As I jot them 
down 1 simultaneously open the 
aperture of my mind for , my 
customary scan of the client’s 
interior, to give me some idea of 
the proper tone to use in the paper. 
Will I be able to do a convincing 
job of faking the kind of essay 
Yahya Lumumba is likely to 
turn in? It will be a taxing technical 
challenge if 1 have to write in 
black hipster jargon, coming on all 
cool, jazzy and snotty, every line 
laughing in the ofay prof’s fat face. 
I imagine I could do it — but does 
Lumumba want me to? Will he 
thank I’m mocking him if I adopt 
the jiveass style and seem to be 
putting him on as he might put on 
the prof? I must know these things. 
So 1 slip my snaky tendrils past 
his woolly scalp into the hidden 
gray jelly. Hello, big black man. 
Entering, I pick up a somewhat 
more immediate and vivid version 
of the generalized persona he 
constantly projects — the hyped-up 
black pride, the mistrust of the 
paleface stranger, the chuckling 
enjoyment of his own lean long- 
legged muscular frame. But these 
are mere residual attitudes, the 
standard furniture of his mind. I 
have not yet reached the level of 



this-minute thought. I have not 
penetrated to the essential Yahya 
Lumumba, the unique individual 
whose style I must assume. I 
push deeper. As I sink in I sense a 
distinct warming of the psychic 
temperature, an outflow of heat, 
comparable perhaps to what a 
miner might experience five miles 
down, tunneling toward the 
magmatic fires at Earth’s core. 
This man Lumumba is constantly 
boiling within, I realize. The glow 
from his tumultuous soul warns me 
to be careful, but I have not yet 
gained the information I seek and 
so I go onward, until abruptly the 
molten frenzy of his stream of con- 
sciousness hits me with terrible 
force. Christ / hate the little bald 
mother conning me three-fifty a

twenty bucks to do something I’m

A roaring furnace. The heat is 
overwhelming. I’ve been in contact 
with intense minds before, far 
more intense even than this one, but 
that was when I was younger, 
stronger, more resilient. I can’t 
handle this volcanic blast. The 
force of his contempt for me is 
magnified factorially by the force 
of the self-contempt that needing 
my services makes him feel. He is 
a pillar of hatred. And my poor 
enfeebled power can’t take it. Some 
sort of automatic safety device 
cuts in to protect me from an 
overload: the mental receptors 
shut themselves down. This is a 
new experience for me, a strange 
one, this load-shedding phenom- 
enon. It is as though limbs are 
dropping off, ears, balls, anything 
disposable, leaving nothing but a 
smooth torso. The inputs fall 
away — the mind of Yahya Lum- 
umba retreats and is inaccessible 
to me and I find myself involun- 
tarily reversing the process of 



penetration until 1 can feel only 
his most superficial emanations. 
Then not even those, only a gray 
furry exudation marking the mere 
presence of him alongside me. 
All is indistinct. All is muffled. 
Bourn. We are back to that again. 
There is a ringing in my ears — it 
is an artifact of the sudden 
silence, a silence loud as thunder. 
A new stage on my downward 
path. Never have I lost my grip 
and slipped from a mind like this. 
I look up, dazed, shattered. 
Yahya Lumumba’s thin lips are 
tightly compressed. He stares down 
at me in distaste, having no inkling 
of what has occurred. 

I say faintly, “I’d like ten dollars 
now in advance. The rest you pay 
when I deliver the paper.’’ 

He tells me coldly that he has no 
money to give me today. His 
next check from the scholarship 
fund isn’t due until the beginning 
of the coming month. I’ll just 
have to do the job on faith, he 
says. You can take it or leave it, 
man. 

“Can you manage five?’’ I ask. 
“As a binder. Faith isn’t enough. 
I have expenses.” He glares. He 
draws himself to his full height; 
he seems nine or ten feet tall. 
Without a word he takes a five- 
dollar bill from his wallet, erumples 
it, scornfully tosses it into my lap. 
“I’ll see you here the morning of 
November ninth,” I call after him 
as he stalks away. Europydes, 
Sophocles, Eeskilus. I sit stunned.

shivering, listening to the bellowing 
silence. Bourn. Bourn. Bourn. 

X 

I N HIS more flamboyantly 
Dostoyevskian moments, David 
Selig liked to think of his power as 
a curse, a savage penalty for some 
unimaginable sin. Certainly his 
special ability had caused a lot of 
trouble for him, but in his saner 
moments he knew that calling it 
a curse was sheer self-indulgent 
melodrama. The power was a 
divine gift. The power brought 
ecstasy. Without the power he was 
nothing; with it he was a god. Is 
that a curse? Is that so terrible? 
Something funny happens when 
gamete meets gamete and destiny 
cries. Here, Selig-baby — be a god! 
This you would spurn? Don’t kid 
yourself, Duvid: no matter how 
badly the telepathy stuff messed 
you up, and it messed you up pretty 
badly, you wouldn’t have done 
without it for a minute. Because the 
power brought ecstasy. 

The power brought ecstasy. 
That’s it in a single crisp phrase. 
Mortals are born into a vale of tears 
and they get their kicks wherever 
they can. Some, seeking pleasure, 
are compelled to turn to sex, drugs, 
booze, television, movies, pinochle, 
the stock market, the racetrack, 
the roulette wheel, whips and 
chains, collecting first ^itions, 
Caribbean cruises, Chinese snuff 
bottles, rubber garments, whatever. 



Not him, not the accursed David 
Selig. All he had to do was sit 
quietly with his apparatus wide 
open and drink in the thought 
waves drifting on the telepathic 
breeze. With the greatest of ease he 
lived a hundred vicarious lives. 
He heaped his treasure house with 
the plunder of a thousand souls. 
Ecstasy. Of course, the ecstatic 
part was all quite some time ago. 

The best years were those be- 
tween ages of fourteen and twenty- 
five. Younger, and he was still too 
naive, too unformed, to wring 
much appreciation from the data 
he took in. Older, and his growing 
bitterness, his sour sense of isola- 
tion, damped his capacity for joy. 
Fourteen to twenty-five, though. 
The golden years. Ah! 

It was so very much more vivid 
then. Life was like a waking dream. 
There were no walls in his world — 
he could go anywhere and see 
anything. The intense flavor of 
existence. Steeped in the rich 
juices of perception. Not until 
Selig was past forty did he 
realize how much he had lost, over 
the years, in the way of fine focus 
and depth of field. The power 
had not begun detectably to dim 
until he was well along in his 
thirties, but it obviously must 
have been fading by easy stages all 
through his manhood, dwindling 
so gradually that he remained 
unaware of the cumulative loss. 
The change had been absolute, 
qualitative rather than quantitative.

GALAXY 



Even on a good day, now, the in- 
puts did not begin to approach the 
intensity of those he remembered 
from his adolescence. In those 
remote years the power had 
brought him not only bits of 
subcranial conversation and scat- 
tered snatches of soul, as now, but 
also a gaudy universe of colors, 
textures, scents, densities — the 
world through an infinity of other 
sensory intakes, the world captured 
and played out for his delight on 
the glassy radiant spherical screen 
within his mind. 

F or instance. He lies propped 
against an itchy August hay- 
stack in a hot Brueghelesque 
landscape, shortly past noon. This 
is 1950 and he hangs becalmed 
midway between his fifteenth 
birthday and his sixteenth. Some 
sound effects. Maestro: Bee- 

thoven’s Sixth, bubbling up gently, 
sweet flutes and playful piccolos. 
The sun dangles in a cloudless sky. 
A gentle wind stirs the willows 
bordering the cornfield. The 
young corn trembles. The brook 
burbles. A starling circles over- 
head. He hears crickets. He hears 
the drone of a mosquito, and 
watches calmly as it zeroes in on 
his bare, hairless, sweat-shiny 
chest. His feet are bare, too — he 
wears only tight, faded blue jeans. 
City boy, digging the country. 

The farm is in the Catskills, 
twelve miles north of Ellenville. 
It is owned by the Schieles, a 



tribe of tawny Teutons, who 
produce eggs and an assortment of 
vegetable crops and who supple- 
ment their earnings every summer 
by renting out their guest house. 
This year the tenants are Sam and 
Annette Stein of Brooklyn, New 
York, and their daughter Barbara. 
The Steins have invited their close 
friends, Paul and Martha Selig, 
to spend a week on the farm with 
their son David and their daughter 
Judith. (Sam Stein and Paul Selig 
are hatching a scheme, destined 
ultimately to empty their bank 
accounts, to enter into a partner- 
ship and act as jobbers for replace- 
ment parts for television sets. Paul 
Selig is forever attempting unwise 
business ventures.) Today is the 
third day of the visit and this 
afternoon, mysteriously, David 
finds himself utterly alone. His 
father has gone on an all-day hike 
with Sam Stein. Their wives have 
driven off, taking five-year-old 
Judith with them, to explore the 
antique shops of Ellenville. No 
one remains on the premises except 
the tight-lipped Schieles, going 
somberly about their unending 
chores, and sixteen-year-old 
Barbara Stein, who has been 
David’s classmate from the third 
grade on through high school. 
The Steins and the Seligs evidently 
have some unvoiced hope that 
romance will blossom between 
their offspring. This is naive of 
them. Barbara, a lush and reason- 
ably beautiful dark-haired girl.

47 



sleek-skinned and long-legged, 
sophisticated and smooth of 
manner, is six months older than 
David chronologically and three 
or four years ahead of him in 
social development. She does not 
actually dislike him, but she re- 
gards him as strange, disturbing, 
alien and repellent. She has no 
knowledge of his special gift — no 
one does; he’s seen to that — but 
she’s had seven years to observe 
him at close range and she knows 
there’s something fishy about 
him. She is a conventional girl, 
plainly destined to marry early 
(a doctor, a lawyer, an insurance 
broker) and have lots of babies, 
and the chances of romance 
flowering between her and anyone 
as dark-souled and odd as David 
Selig are slight. David knows this 
very well and he is not at all 
surprised, or even dismayed, when 
Barbara slips away in mid-morn- 
ing. “If anyone asks,” she says, 
“tell them I went for a stroll in 
the woods.” David is not deceived. 
He knows she goes off to meet 
19-year-old Hans Schiele at 
every chance she gets. 

S O HE is left to his own re- 
sources. No matter. He has 
ways of entertaining himself. He 
settles down in a quiet corner of the 
fields. Time for mind-movies. 
Lazily he casts his net. The power 
rises and goes forth, looking for 
emanations. What shall I read, 
what shall I read? Ah. A sense of 



contact. His questing mind has 
snared another mind, a buzzing 
one, small, dim, intense. It is 
a bee’s mind, in fact — David is 
not limited only to contact with 
humans. Of course there are no 
verbal outputs from the bee or any 
conceptual ones. If the bee thinks 
at all David is incapable of detect- 
ing those thoughts. But he does 
get into the bee’s head. He exper- 
iences a strong sense of what it is 
like to be tiny and compact and 
winged and fuzzy. How dry the 
universe of a bee is: bloodless, 
desiccated, arid. He soars. He 
swoops. He evades a passing bird 
as monstrous as a winged elephant. 
He burrows deep into a steamy, 
pollen-laden blossom. He goes 
aloft again. He sees the world 
through the bee’s faceted eyes. 
Everything breaks into a thousand 
fragments, as though seen through 
a cracked glass — the essential 
color of everything is gray, but odd 
hues lurk at the corners of things, 
peripheral blues and scarlets that 
do not correspond in any way to 
the colors he knows. But the mind 
of a bee is a limited one. David 
bores easily. He abandons the 
insect abruptly and, zooming his 
perceptions barnward, clicks into 
the soul of a hen. She is laying 
an egg! Rhythmic internal con- 
tractions, pleasurable and painful, 
like the voiding of a mighty turd. 
Frenzied squawks. The smarmy 
hencoop odor, sharp and biting. 
A sense of too much straw all

about. The world looks dark and 
dull to this bird. Heave. Heave. 
Oooh! Orgasmic excitement! The 
egg slides through the hatch and 
lands safely. The hen subsides, 
fulfilled, exhausted. David departs 
from her in this moment of rapture. 
He plunges deep into the adjoining 
woods, finds a human mind, enters 
it. How much richer and more 
intense it is to make communion 
with his own species. His identity 
blurs into that of his communicant, 
who is Barbara Stein, who is 
naked and lying on a carpet of 
last year’s fallen leaves. Her skin 
is damp with sweat. Hans’ fingers 
dig into the soft flesh of her 
shoulders and his cheek, rough 
with blond stubble, abrades her 
cheek. His weight presses down on 
her and David picks up her 
clamorous heartbeat. He notices 
her hammering her heels against 
the calves of Hans’ legs. And now 
he senses the first dizzying spasms 
of orgasm. David struggles to 
remain with her, but he knows he 
won’t succeed — clinging to the 
consciousness of Barbara at a 
moment like this is like trying to 
ride a wild horse. She catapults 
David from her unsaddled mind. 
He travels only a short way — into 
the stolid soul of Hans Schiele. 
Hungry for information, David 
holds on with all his strength, 
hoping to keep contact, but no, he 
is flipped free. He tumbles un- 
controllably, the world goes 
swinging past him in giddy 



streaks of color, until — click ! — 
he finds a new sanctuary. All is 
calm here. He glides through a dark 
cold environment. He has no 
weight. His body is long and 
slender and agile — his mind is 
nearly a void, but through it run 
faint chilly flickering perceptions 
of a low order. He has entered the 
consciousness of a fish, perhaps a 
brook trout. Downstream he 
moves in the swiftly rushing 
creek, taking delight in the 
smoothness of his motions and 
the delicious texture of the pure 
icy water flowing past his fins. 
He can see very little and smell 
even less — information comes to 
him in the form of minute impacts 
on his scales, tiny deflections and 
interferences. Easily he responds 
to each incoming news item, now 
twisting to avoid a fang of rock, 
now fluttering his fins to seize some 
speedy subcurrent. The process is 
fascinating, but the trout itself is 
a dull companion and David, 
having extracted the troutness of 
the experience in two or three min- 
utes, leaps gladly to a more com- 
plex mind the moment he 
approaches one. It is the mind of 
gnarled old Georg Schiele, 
Hans’s father, who is at work in a 
remote corner of the cornfield. 
David has never entered the elder 
Schiele’s mind before. The old 
man is a grim and forbidding 
character, well past sixty, who 
says little and stalks dourly 
through his day-long round of 



DYING INSIDE

chores, his heavy-jowled face 
perpetually locked in a frosty 
scowl. The farmer gives off so 
unpleasant a psychic aura that 
David has steered clear of him, 
but so bored is he with the trout 
that he slips into Schiele now, 
slides down through dense layers 
of unintelligible Deutsch rumina- 
tions and strikes bottom in the 
basement of the farmer’s soul, 
the place where his essence lives. 
Astonishment: old Schiele is a 
mystic, an ecstatic! No dourness 
here. No dark Lutheran vindictive- 
ness. This is pure Buddhism: 
Schiele stands in the rich soil of 
his fields, leaning on his hoe, 
feet firmly planted, communing 
with the universe. God floods his 
soul. He touches the unity of all 
things. Sky, trees, earth, sun, 
plants, brook, insects, birds — 
everything is one, part of a seam- 
less whole, and Schiele resonates 
in perfect harmony with it. How 
can this be? How can such a bleak, 
inaccessible man entertain such 
raptures in his depths? Feel his 
joy! Sensations drench him! Bird- 
song, sunlight, the scent of flowers 
and clods of upturned earth, the 
rustling of the sharp-bladed 
green cornstalks, the trickle of 
sweat down the reddened deep- 
channeled neck, the curve of the 
planet, the fleecy premature out- 
line of the full moon, a thousand 
delights enfold this man. David 
shares his pleasure. He kneels in 
his mind, reverent, awed. The 



world is a mighty hymn. Schiele 
breaks from his stasis, raises his 
hoe, brings it down. Heavy 
muscles go taut and metal digs 
into earth and everything is as it 
should be, all conforms to the 
divine plan. Is this how Schiele 
goes through his days? Is such 
happiness possible? David is sur- 
prised to find tears bulging in his 
eyes. This simple man, this narrow 
man, lives in daily grace. Suddenly 
sullen, bitterly envious, David rips 
his mind free, whirls, projects it 
toward the woods, drops down 
into Barbara Stein again. She 
lies back, sweat-sticky, exhausted. 
She rubs her hands over her skin, 
plucking stray bits of leaf and 
grass from herself. Her mind is 
slow, dull, almost as empty as the 
trout’s just now: sex seems to have 
drained her of personality. David 
shifts to Hans and finds him no 
better. Lying by Barbara’s side, 
still breathing hard after his 
exertions, he is torpid and depres- 
sed. All desire is gone from him — 
peering sleepily at the girl he has 
just possessed, he is conscious 
mainly of body odors and the 
untidiness of her hair. Through the 
upper levels of his mind wanders 
a wistful thought, in English 
punctuated by clumsy German, of 
a girl from an adjoining farm who 
will do something to him that 
Barbara refuses to do. Hans will 
be seeing her on Saturday night. 
Poor Barbara, David thinks, and 
wonders what she would say if 



50

she knew what Hans is thinking. 
Idly he tries to bridge their two 
minds, entering both in the 
mischievous hope that thoughts 
may flow from one to the other, 
but he miscalculates his span and 
finds himself returning to old 
Schiele, deep in his ecstasy, while 
holding contact with Hans as 
well. Father and son, old and 
young, priest and profaner. David 
sustains the twin contact a moment. 
He shivers. He is filled with a 
thundering sense of the wholeness 
of life. 

I T WAS like that all the time in 
those years — an endless trip, 
a gaudy voyage. But powers decay. 
Time leaches the colors from the 
best of visions. The world becomes 
grayer. Entropy beats us down. 
Everything fades. Everything goes. 
Everything dies. 

XI 

J UDITH’S dark, rambling apart- 
ment fills with pungent smells. 
I hear her in the kitchen, bustling, 
dumping spices into the pot: hot 
chili, oregano, tarragon, cloves, 
garlic, powdered mustard, sesame 
oil, curry powder, God knows what 
else. Fire burn and cauldron bub- 
ble. Her famous fiery spaghetti 
sauce is in the making. 

I have arrived unexpectedly 
early, a half-hour before the ap- 
pointed time, catching Judith 
unprepared, not even dressed, so 



I am on my own while she readies 
dinner. “Fix yourself a drink,” 
she calls to me. 1 go to the side- 
board and pour a shot of dark 
rum, then into the kitchen for ice 
cubes. Judith, flustered, wearing 
housecoat and headband, flies 
madly about, breathlessly selecting 
spices. She does everything at top 
speed. “Be with you in another 
ten minutes,” she gasps, reaching 
for the pepper mill. “Is the kid 
making a lot of trouble for you?” 

My nephew, she means. His 
name is Paul, in honor of our 
father which art in heaven, but she 
never calls him that, only “the 
baby,” “the kid.” Four years 
old. Child of divorce, destined to 
be as taut-strung as his mother. 
“He’s not bothering me at all,” 
I assure her and go back to the 
living room. 

The apartment is one of those 
old, immense West Side jobs, 
roomy and high-ceilinged, which 
carries with it some sort of aura 
of intellectual distinction simply 
because so many critics, poets, 
playwrights, and choreographers 
have lived in similar apartments 
in this very neighborhood. Giant 
living room with many windows 
looking out over West End Avenue 
— formal dining room, big kitchen, 
master bedroom, child’s room, 
maid’s room, two bathrooms. 
All for Judith and her cub. The 
rent is cosmic, but Judith can 
manage it. She gets well over a 
thousand a month from her ex and 



DYING INSIDE 



51 



earns a modest but decent living of 
her own as an editor and translator. 
Aside from that she has a small 
income from a portfolio of stocks, 
shrewdly chosen for her a few years 
ago by a lover from Wall Street, 
which she purchased with her 
inherited share of our parents’ 
surprisingly robust savings. (My 
share went to clean up accumulated 
debts — the whole thing melted 
like June snow.) The place is 
furnished half in 1960 Greenwich 
Village and half in 1970 Urban 
Elegance — black pole lamps, gray 
string chairs, red brick bookcases, 
cheap prints and wax-encrusted 
Chianti bottles on the one hand; 
leather couches. Hopi pottery, 
psychedelic silk-screens, glass- 
topped coffee tables and giant 
potted cacti on the other. Bach 
harpsichord sonatas tinkle from 
the thousand-dollar speaker sys- 
tem. The floor, ebony-dark and 
mirror-bright, gleams between the 
lush, thick area rugs. A good life 
my sister leads here. Good and 
miserable. 

The kid eyes me untrustingly. 
He sits twenty feet away by the 
window, fiddling with some 
intricate plastic toy but keeping 
close watch on me. A dark child, 
slender and tense like his mother, 
aloof, cool. No love is lost between 
us — I’ve been inside his head and 
I know what he thinks of me. To 
him I’m one of the many men in 
his mother’s life, a real uncle being 
not very different from the in- 



numerable uncle-surrogates forever 
sleeping over. I suppose he thinks 
I’m just one of her lovers who 
shows up more often than most. An 
understandable error. But while 
he resents the others merely 
because they compete with him for 
her affection, he looks coldly upon 
me because he thinks I’ve caused 
his mother pain — he dislikes me 
for her sake. How shrewdly he’s 
discerned the decades-old network 
of hostilities and tensions that 
shapes and defines my relationship 
with Judith! So I’m an enemy. 
He’d gut me if he could. 

I SIP my drink, listen to Bach, 
smile insincerely at the kid, 
and inhale the aroma of spaghetti 
sauce. My power is practically 
quiescent — I try not to use it much 
here and in any case its intake is 
feeble today. After some time 
Judith emerges from the kitchen 
and, flashing across the living 
room, says, “Come talk to me 
while I get dressed, Duv.’’ I follow 
her to her bedroom and sit down 
on the bed. She takes her clothes 
into the adjoining bathroom, leav- 
ing the door open only an inch or 
two. The last time I saw her naked 
she was seven years old. She says, 
“I’m glad you decided to come.” 
“So am I.” 

“You look awfully peaked 
though.” 

“Just hungry, Jude.” 

“I’ll fix that in five minutes.” 
Sounds of water running. She says

something else. The sink drowns 
her out. 1 look idly around the 
bedroom. A man’s white shirt, 
much too big for Judith, hangs 
casually from the doorknob of the 
closet. On the night table sit two 
fat textbooky-looking books; 
Analytical Neuroendocrinology 
and Studies in the Physiology of 
Thermoregulation. U nlikely read- 
ing for Judith. Both by the same 
author: K.F. Silvestri, M.D., 

Ph.D. 

“You going to medical school 
these days?’’ I ask. 

“The books, you mean? They’re 
Karl’s.’’ 

Karl? A new name. Dr. Karl F. 
Silvestri. I touch her mind lightly 
and extract his image: a tall 
hefty sober-faced man, broad 
shoulders, strong dimpled chin, 
flowing mane of graying hair. 
About fifty. I’d guess. Judith digs 
older men. While I raid her con- 
sciousness she tells me about him. 
Her current “friend,” the kid’s 
latest “uncle.” He’s someone 
very big at Columbia Medical 
Center, a real authority on the 
human body. Newly divorced after 
a twenty-five-year marriage. Uh- 
huh, she likes getting them on the 
rebound. He met her three weeks 
ago through a mutual friend, a 
psychoanalyst. They’ve only seen 
each other four or five times — 
he’s always busy, committee meet- 
ings at this hospital or that, 
seminars, consultations. It must 
be a serious affair if she’s trying to 



read his books. They look abso- 
lutely opaque to me, all charts and 
statistical tables and heavy 
Latinate terminology. 

She comes out of the bathroom 
wearing a sleek purple pants-suit 
and the crystal earrings I gave her 
for her twenty-ninth birthday. 
When 1 visit she always tries to 
register some little sentimental 
touch to tie us together — tonight 
it’s the earrings. There is a con- 
valescent quality to our friendship 
nowadays, as we tiptoe gently 
through the garden where our 
old hatred lies buried. We em- 
brace, a brother-sister hug. A 
pleasant perfume. “Hello,” she 
says. “I’m sorry I was such a mess 
when you walked in.” 

“It’s my fault. I was too early. 
Anyway, you weren’t a mess at 
all.” 

She leads me to the living room. 
She carries herself well. Judith is 
a handsome woman, tall and ex- 
tremely slender, exotic-looking, 
with dark hair, dark complexion, 
sharp cheekbones. The slim sultry 
type. I suppose she’d be considered 
very sexy but that there is some- 
thing cruel about her thin lips and 
her quick glistening brown eyes — 
and that cruelty, which grows more 
intense in these years of divorce 
and discontent, turns people off. 
She’s had lovers by the dozen, by 
the gross, but not much love. You 
and me, sis, you and me. Chips 
off the old block. 

She sets the table while I fix a 



DYING INSIDE 



53 



drink for her. The kid, thank God, 
has already eaten— 1 hate having 
him at the table. He plays with his 
plastic thingy and favors me with 
occasional sour glares. Judith and 
I clink our cocktail glasses to- 
gether, a stagy gesture. She pro- 
duces a wintry smile. “Cheers,” 
we say. Cheers. 

“Why don’t you move back 
downtown?” she asks. “We could 
see more of each other.” 

“It’s cheap up there. Do we 
want to see more of each other?” 
“Who else do we have?” 

“You have Karl.” 

“I don’t have him or anybody. 
Just my kid and my brother.” 

1 think of the time when 1 tried 
to murder her in her bassinet. She 
doesn’t know about that. “Are we 
really friends, Jude?” 

“Now we are. At last.” 

“We haven’t exactly been fond 
of each other all these years.” 
“People change, Duv. They 
grow up. I was dumb, so wrapped 
up in myself that 1 couldn’t give 
anything but hate to anybody 
around me. That’s over now. If 
you don’t believe me, look into my 
head and see.” 

“You don’t want me poking 
around in there.” 

“Go ahead,” she says. “Take a 
good look and see if I haven’t 
changed toward you.” 

“No. I’d rather not.” I deal 
myself another two ounces of rum. 
The hand shakes a little. 
“Shouldn’t you check the spaghetti 



sauce? Maybe it’s boiling over.” 

“Let it boil. I haven’t finished my 
drink. Duv, are you still having 
trouble? With your power, I 
mean.” 

“Yes. Still. Worse than ever.” 
“What do you think is 
happening?” 

I shrug. Insouciant old me. “I’m 
losing it, that’s all. It’s like hair, 

I suppose. A lot of it when you’re 
young, then less and less and 
finally none. Screw it. It never did 
me any good anyway.” 

“You don't mean that.” 

“Show me what it did for me.” 

“It made you someone special. 

It made you unique. When every- 
thing else went wrong for you, you 
could always fall back on that, 
the knowledge that you could go 
into minds, that you could see | 
the unseeable, that you could get 
close to people’s souls. A gift 
from God.” 

“A useless gift. Except if I’d gone 
into the sideshow business.” 

“It made you a richer person. | 
More complex, more interesting. 1 

Without it you might have been 
someone quite ordinary.” 

“With it I turned out to be 
someone quite ordinary. A nobody, 
a zero. Without it 1 might have 
been a happy nobody instead of 
a dismal one.” 

“You pity yourself a lot, Duv.” 
“I’ve got a lot to pity myself 
for. Another drink, Jude?” 

“Thanks, no. 1 ought to look 
after dinner.”

S HE goes into the kitchen. 

Behind me the kid begins to 
chant derisive nonsense syllables 
in his weirdly mature baritone. 
Even in my current state of dulled 
receptivity 1 feel the pressure of 
the kid’s cold hatred against the 
back of my skull. Judith returns, 
toting a well-laden tray — spaghetti, 
garlic bread, cheese. We clink wine 
glasses. We eat in silence a few 
minutes. She says finally, “Can 1 
do some mindreading on you, 
Duv?” 

“Be my guest.” 

“You say you’re glad the 
power’s going. Is that snow job 
directed at me or at yourself? 
Because you’re snowing somebody. 
You hate the idea of losing it, 
don’t you?” 

“A little.” 

“A lot, Duv.” 

“All right, a lot. I’m of two 
minds. I’d like it to vanish com- 
pletely. Christ, 1 wish I’d never had 
it. But on the other hand — if I 
lose it who am I? Where’s my 
identity? I’m Selig the-Mindreader, 
right? The Amazing Mental Man. 
So if I stop being him — you see, 
Jude?” 

“I see. The pain’s all over your 
face. I’m so sorry, Duv.” 

“For what?” 

“That you’re losing it.” 

“You despised my guts for using 
it on you, didn’t you?” 

“That’s different. That was a 
long time ago. I know what you 
must be going through now. Do 



you have any idea of why you’re 
losing it?” 

“No. A function of aging, I 
guess.” 

“Is there anything that might be 
done to stop it from going?” 

“I doubt it, Jude. I don’t even 
know why I have the gift in the 
first place, let alone how to 
nurture it now. 1 don’t know how 
it works. It’s just something in my 
head, a genetic fluke, a thing 1 
was born with, like freckles. If 
your freckles start to fade can you 
figure out a way of making them 
stay — if you want them to stay?” 
“You’ve never let yourself be 
studied, have you?” 

“No.” 

“Why not?” 

“I don’t like people poking in my 
head any more than you do,” I 
say softly. “I don’t want to be a 
case history. I’ve always kept a 
low profile. If the world ever 
found out about me I’d become a 
pariah. I’d probably be lynched. Do 
you know how many people there 
are to whom I’ve openly admitted 
the truth about myself? In my 
whole life, how many?” 

“A dozen?” 

“Three,” I say. “And 1 wouldn’t 
willingly have told any of them.” 
“Three?” 

“You. I suppose you suspected 
it all along, but you didn’t 
find out for sure till you were 
sixteen, remember? Then there’s 
Tom Nyquist, whom I don’t 
see any more. And a girl named 



DYING INSIDE 



.55 



Kitty, whom I don’t see any more 
either.” 

“What about the tall brunette?” 
“Toni? I never explicitly told 
her. I tried to hide it from her. 
She found out indirectly. A lot of 
people may have found out in- 
directly. But I’ve only told three. I 
don’t want to be known as a 
freak. So let it fade. Let it die. 
Good riddance.” 

“You want to keep it, though.” 
“To keep it and lose it, both.” 
“That’s a contradiction.” 

“Do I contradict myself? Very 
well, then I contradict myself. 
I am large, 1 contain multitudes. 
What can I say, Jude? What can 
I tell you that’s true?” 

“Are you in pain?” 

“Who isn’t in pain?” 

She says, “Losing it is almost 
like becoming impotent, isn’t it, 
Duv? To reach into a mind and 
find out that you can’t connect? 
You said there was ecstasy in it 
for you, once. That flood of 
information, that vicarious ex- 
perience. And now you can’t get 
it as much— or at all. You mind 
can’t get it up. Do you see it that 
way, as a sexual metaphor?” 
“Sometimes.” I give her more 
wine. For a few minutes we sit 
silently, shoveling down the 
spaghetti, exchanging tentative 
grins. I almost feel warmth 
toward her. Forgiveness for all 
the years when she treated me like 
a circus attraction. You sneaky 
bastard, Duv. stay out of my 



head or I’ll kill you! You voyeur. 
You peeper. Keep away, man, 
keep away. She didn’t want me to 
meet her fiance. Afraid I’d tell 
him about her other men, I guess. 

I’d like to find you dead in the 
gutter some day, Duv, with all • 
my secrets rotting inside you. So 
long ago. Maybe we love each ’ 
other a little now, Jude. Just a 
little, but you love me more than 
I love you. 

“I don’t come any more,” she 
says abruptly. “You know, I 
used to — practically every time. 
The original Hot Pants Kid, me. 

But around five years ago some- 
thing happened, around the time 
my marriage was first breaking 
up. I started feeling the ability to 
respond slip away from me. 
Finally I couldn’t make it at all. 

I still can’t. It’s one of the things 
Karl’s going to work on with me. 

So I know what it’s like, Duv. 
What you must be going through. 

To lose your best way of making 
contact with others. To lose con- 
tact gradually with yourself. To 
become a stranger in your own 
head.” She smiles. “Did you 
know that about me? About the 
troubles I’ve been having?” 

I hesitate briefly. The icy glare 
in her eyes gives her away. The 
aggressiveness. The resentment 
she feels. Even when she tries to be 
loving she can’t help hating. How 
fragile our relationship is! We’re 
locked in a kind of marriage, Judith 
and I, an old burned-out marriage

held together with skewers. What 
the hell, though. “Yes,” 1 tell her. 
“1 knew about it.” 

“1 thought so. You’ve never 
stopped probing me.” Her smile is 
all hateful glee now. She’s glad I’m 
losing it. She’s relieved. “I’m 
always wide open to you, Duv.” 
“Don’t worry, you won’t be much 
longer.” Oh, you sadistic bitch! 
And you’re all I’ve got. “How 
about some more spaghetti, Jude?”

THE “ELECTRA” theme IN 
AESCHYLUS, SOPHOCLES AND 
EURIPIDES 

The use of the “Electra” 
motif by Aeschylus, Sophocles 
and Euripides is a study in 
varying dramatic methods and 
modes of attack. The plot is 
basically the same in Aeschy- 
lus’ Choephori and the 
Electros of Sophocles and 
Euripides: Orestes, exiled son 
of murdered Agamemnon, 
returns to his native Mycenae, 
where he discovers his sister 
Electra. She persuades him to 
avenge Agamenmon’s murder 
by killing Clytemnestra and 
Aegisthus, who had slain 
Agamemnon on his return 
from Troy. 



Aeschylus, unlike his later 
rivals, held as prime considera- 
tion the ethical and religious 
aspects of Orestes’ crime. 
Characterization and moti- 
vation in The Choephori are 
simple to the point of inviting 
ridicule — as, indeed, we can see 
when the more worldly-minded 
Euripides ridicules Aeschylus 
in the recognition scene of his 
Electra. In Aeschylus’ play 
Orestes appears accompanied 
by his friend Pylades and 
places an offering on Agame- 
mnon’s tomb — a lock of his 
hair. They withdraw and la- 
menting Electra comes to the 
tomb. Noticing the lock of 
hair, she recognizes it as being 
“like unto those my father’s 
children wear,” and decides 
Orestes has sent it to the tomb 
as a token of mourning. 
Orestes then reappears and 
identifies himself to Electra. 

It is this implausible means of 
identification which was paro- 
died by Euripides. 

O H, GOD. This is deadly. This 
is no damned good at all. 
Could Yahya Lumumba have 
written any of this crap? Phony 
from Word One. Why should 
Yahya Lumumba give a damn 
about Greek tragedy? Why 
should I? What’s Hecuba to him 
or he to Hecuba that he should 
weep for her? I’ll tear this up and 
start again. I’ll write it jivey, man.

ril give it that rhythm. God help 
me to think black. But I can’t. 
But 1 can’t. Christ, I’d like to 
throw up. 1 think I’m getting a 
fever. Wait. Maybe a joint would 
help some. Yeah. Let’s get high and 
try again. A lil ole stick of mootah. 
Get some soul into it, man. 
Smartass white Jew-bastard, get 
some soul into it, you hear? Okay, 
now. There was this cat Agame- 
mnon, he was one big important 
mother, you hear, he was The 
Man, but he got screwed all the 
same. His old lady Clytemnestra, 
she was makin’ it with this 
Aegisthus and one day she say. 
Baby, let’s waste old Aggie, you 
and me, and then you gonna be 
king — gwine be king? — gonna — 
and we have a high ole time. 
Aggie, he off in the Nam runnin’ 
the show, but he come home for 
some R & R and before he know 
what happenin’ they stick him 
good, right, they really cut him and 
that all for him. Now there this 
crazy broad Electra, dig, she the 
daughter of ole Aggie and she get 
real uptight when they use him up, 
so she say to her brother, his name 
Orestes, she say, listen, Orestes, 
I want you to get them two — 
I want you to get them real good. 
Now, this cat Orestes he been out 
of town for a while, he don’t know 
the score, but. 

Yeah, that’s it, man! You’re 
digging it! Now go on to explain 
about Euripides’ use of the deus 
ex machina and the cathartic 



virtues of Sophocles’ dramatic 
technique. Sure. What a dumb 
shmuck you are, Selig. What a 
dumb shmuck. 

XIII 

N YQUIST said, “The real 
trouble with you, Selig, is 
that you’re a deeply religious man 
who doesn’t happen to believe in 
God.’’ Nyquist was always saying 
things like that and Selig never 
could be sure whether he meant 
them or was just playing verbal 
games. No matter how deeply 
Selig penetrated the other man’s 
soul he never could be sure of any- 
thing. Nyquist was too wily, too 
elusive. 

Playing it safe, Selig said nothing. 
He stood with his back to Nyquist, 
looking through the window. Snow 
was falling. The narrow streets 
below were choked with it — not 
even the municipal snowplows 
could get through and a strange 
serenity prevailed. High winds 
whipped the drifts about. Parked 
cars were disappearing under the 
white blanket. It had been snowing 
on and off for three days. Snow 
was general all over the Northeast. 
It was falling on every filthy city, 
on the arid suburbs, falling softly 
upon the Appalachians and, farther 
eastward, softly falling into the 
dark mutinous Atlantic waves. 
Nothing was moving in New York 
City. Everything was shut down — 
office buildings, schools, the 



58 



GALAXY 



concert halls, the theaters. The 
railroads were out of commission 
and the highways were blocked. 
There was no action at the airports. 
Unable to get to work, Selig had 
waited out most of the blizzard in 
Nyquist’s apartment, spending so 
much time with him that by now he 
had come to find his friend’s com- 
pany stifling and oppressive. What 
earlier had seemed amusing and 
charming in Nyquist had become 
abrasive and tricksy. Nyquist’s 
bland self-assurance conveyed it- 
self now as smugness — his casual 
forays into Selig’s mind were no 
longer affectionate gestures of 
intimacy, but, rather, conscious 
acts of aggression. His habit of 
repeating aloud what Selig was 
thinking was increasingly irritating 
and there seemed to be no deterring 
him from that. Here he was doing 
it again, plucking a quotation from 
Selig’s head and declaiming it in 
half-mocking tones: “Ah. How 
pretty. ‘His soul swooned slowly 
as he heard the snow falling faintly 
through the universe and faintly 
falling, like the descent of their 
last end, upon all the living and 
the dead.’ I like that. What is it, 
David?” 

“James Joyce,” said Selig sourly. 
“ ‘The Dead,’ from Dubliners. I 
asked you not to do that.” 

Nyquist, gesturing broadly as 
Selig stepped away from the win- 
dow, turned his palms outward. 
“I’m sorry. I forgot you didn’t 
like it.” 



“You never forget a thing, Tom. 
You never do anything acciden- 
tally.” Then, guilty over his pee- 
vishness: “Christ, I’ve had about 
enough snow!” 

“Snow is general,” said Nyquist. 
“It isn’t ever going to stop. What 
are we going to do today?” 

“The same as yesterday and the 
day before, I imagine. Sit around 
watching the snowflakes fall and 
listen to records and get sloshed.” 
“How about getting laid?” 

“I don't think you're my type.” 
Nyquist flashed an empty smile. 
“Funny man. 1 mean finding a 
couple of ladies marooned some- 
where in this building and inviting 
them to a tittle party.” 

“We could try, I suppose,” Selig 
said, shrugging. “Is there any more 
bourbon?” 

“I’ll get it,” Nyquist said. 

He brought over the bottle. Ny- 
quist moved with a strange slow- 
ness, like a man moving through a 
dense reluctant atmosphere of 
mercury or some other viscious 
fluid. Selig had never seen him 
hurry. He was heavy without being 
fat, a thick-shouldered, thick- 
necked man with a square head, 
close-cropped yellow hair, a flat 
wide-flanged nose and an easy, 
innocent grin. Very, very Aryan — 
he was Scandinavian, a Swede 
perhaps, raised in Finland and 
transplanted to the United States 
at the age of ten. He still had the 
elusive traces of an accent. He said 
he was twenty-eight and looked a

few years older than that to Selig, 
who had just turned twenty-three. 
This was February, 1958. Eisen- 
hower was President, the stock 
market had gone to hell, the post- 
Sputnik emotional slump was 
troubling everybody even though 
the first American space satellite 
had just been orbited and the latest 
feminine fashion was the gunny- 
sack chemise. Selig was living in 
Brooklyn Heights, commuting 
several days a week to the office 
of a publishing company for which 
he was doing freelance copy-editing 
at three dollars an hour. Nyquist 
lived in the same building, four 
floors higher. 

He was the only other person 
Selig knew who had the power. 
Not only that, having it hadn’t 
crippled him at all. Nyquist used 
his gift as simply and as naturally 
as he did his eyes or his legs, for his 
own advantage, without apologies 
and without guilt. Perhaps he was 
the least neurotic person Selig had 
ever met. By occupation he was a 
predator, skimming an income by 
raiding the minds of others, but like 
any jungle cat he pounced only 
when hungry, never for sheer love 
of pouncing. He took what he 
needed, never questioning the prov- 
idence that had made him so su- 
perbly fitted for taking, yet he did 
not take more than he needed and 
his needs were moderate. He held 
no job and apparently never had 
held one. Whenever he wanted 
money he made the ten-minute 



subway ride to Wall Street and 
rummaged about freely in the 
minds of the moneymen cloistered 
in the lofty boardrooms. On any 
given day there was always some 
major development hatching that 
would have an impact on the mar- 
ket — a merger, a stock split, an ore 
discovery, a favorable earnings 
report — and Nyquist had no dif- 
ficulty learning the essential de- 
tails. This information he swiftly 
sold at handsome but reasonable 
fees to some twelve or fifteen pri- 
vate investors who had learned in 
the happiest possible way that 
Nyquist was a reliable tout. Many 
of the unaccountable leaks on 
which quick fortunes had been 
made in the bull market of the ’50’s 
were his doing. He earned a com- 
fortable living this way, enough to 
support himself in a congenial 
style. His apartment was small 
and agreeable — black naugahyde 
upholstery. Tiffany lamps, Picasso 
wallpaper, a well-stocked liquor 
closet, a superb music system that 
emitted a seamless flow of Monte- 
verdi and Palestrina, Bartok and 
Stravinsky. He lived a gracious 
bachelor life, going out often, 
making the rounds of his favorite 
restaurants, all of them obscure 
and ethnic — Japanese, Pakistani, 
Syrian, Greek. His circle of friends 
was limited but distinguished — 
painters, writers, musicians, poets, 
mainly. He slept with many women 
but Selig rarely saw him with the 
same one twice.

L ike Selig, Nyquist could receive 
4 but was unable to send — he 
was, however, able to tell when his 
own mind was being probed. That 
was how they had happened to 
meet. Selig, newly arrived in the 
building, had indulged himself in 
his hobby, letting his conscious- 
ness rove freely from floor to floor 
by way of getting acquainted with 
his neighbors. Bouncing about, 
surveying this head and that, find- 
ing nothing of any special interest 
— and then suddenly: 

— Tell me where you are. 

A crystalline string of words 
glimmering at the periphery of a 
sturdy, complacent mind. The 
statement came through with the 
immediacy of an explicit message. 
Yet Selig realized that no act of 
active transmission had taken place 
— he had simply found the words 
lying passively in wait. He made 
quick reply: 

— Thirty-five Pierrepont Street. 
— No, I know that. I mean, 
where are you in the building? 

— Fourth floor. 

— Tm on the eighth. What’s your 
name? 

—Selig. 

— Nyquist. 

The mental contact was stun- 
ningly intimate. It was almost a 
sexual thing, as though he were 
slicing into a body, not a mind, 
and he was abashed by the reson- 
ant masculinity of the soul he had 
entered — he felt that there was 
something not quite permissible 



about such closeness with another 
man. But he did not draw back. 
That rapid interplay of verbal 
communication across the gap of 
darkness was a delicious experi- 
ence, too rewarding to reject. Selig 
had the momentary illusion of 
having expanded his powers, of 
having learned how to send as well 
as to draw forth the contents of 
other minds. It was, he knew, only 
an illusion. He was sending noth- 
ing, nor was Nyquist. He and 
Nyquist were merely picking in- 
formation out of each other’s 
minds. Each planted phrases for the 
other to find, which was not quite 
the same thing, in terms of the 
situational dynamics, as sending 
messages to one another. It was a 
fine and possibly pointless dis- 
tinction, though — the net effect of 
the juxtaposition of two wide-open 
receivers was an efficient send/ 
receive circuit as reliable as a 
telephone. Tentatively, self-con- 
sciously, Selig reached into the 
lower levels of Nyquist’s con- 
sciousness, seeking the man as 
well as the messages, and as he did 
so he was vaguely aware of disquiet 
in the depths of his own mind, 
probably indicating that Nyquist 
was doing the same to him. For 
long minutes they explored each 
other like lovers entwined in the 
first discovering caresses, although 
there was nothing loving about 
Nyquist’s touch, which was cool 
and impersonal. Nevertheless 
Selig quivered — he felt as if he 



dying inside 



61 



stood at the edge of an abyss. At 
last he gently withdrew,- as did 
Nyquist. Then, from the other: 

— Come upstairs. I’ll meet you 
by the elevator. 

He was bigger than Selig ex- 
pected, a fullback of a man, his 
blue eyes uninviting, his smile a 
purely formal one. He was remote 
without actually being cold. Ny- 
quist offered him a drink and they 
talked, keeping out of one another’s 
minds as much as possible. It was a 
subdued visit, unsentimental, no 
tears of joy at having come together 
at last. Nyquist was affable, acces- 
sible, pleased that Selig had ap- 
peared, but not at all delirious with 
excitement at the discovery of a 
fellow freak. Possibly it was be- 
cause he had discovered fellow 
freaks before. “There are others,” 
he said. “You’re the third, fourth, 
fifth I’ve met since I came to the 
States. Let’s see — one in Chicago, 
one in San Francisco, one in 
Miami, one in Minneapolis. You’re 
the fifth. Two women, three men 
in all.” 

“Are you still in touch with the 
others?” 

“No.” 

“What happened?” 

“We drifted apart,” Nyquist 
said. “What did you expect? That 
we’d be clannish? Look, we talked, 
we played games with our minds, 
we got to know each other and after 
a while we got bored. I think two 
of them are dead now. I don’t mind 
being isolated from the rest of my 



kind. I don’t think of myself as one 
of a tribe.” 

“1 never met another one,” said 
Selig. “Until today.” 

“It isn’t important. What’s im- 
portant is living your own life. 
How old were you when you found 
out you could do it?” 

“I don’t know. Five, six years 
old, maybe. And you?” 

“1 didn’t realize I had anything 
special until I was eleven. 1 thought 
everybody could do it. It was only 
after I came to the States and heard 
people thinking in a different 
language that I knew there was 
something out of the ordinary 
about my mind.” 

“What kind of work do you do?” 
Selig asked. 

“As little as I can,” said Nyquist. 
He grinned and thrust his percep- 
tors brusquely into Selig’s mind. 
It seemed like an invitation of 
sorts — Selig accepted it and pushed 
forth his own antennae. Roaming 
the other man’s consciousness, he 
quickly grasped the picture of Ny- 
quist’s Wall Street sorties. He saw 
the entire balanced, rhythmic, 
unobsessive life of the man. He 
was amazed by Nyquist’s coolness, 
his wholeness, his clarity of spirit. 
How limpid Nyquist’s soul was! 
How unmarred by life! Where did 
he keep his anguish? Where did he 
hide his loneliness, his fear, his 
insecurity? Nyquist, withdrawing, 
said, “Why do you feel so sorry 
for yourself?” 

“Do 1?”

“It’s all over your head. What’s 
the problem, Selig? I’ve looked into 
you and I don’t see the problem, 
only the pain.’’ 

“The problem is that 1 feel iso- 
lated somewhat from other human 
beings.’’ 

“Isolated? You? You can get 
right inside people’s heads. You 
can do something that ninety-nine 
point nine hundred and ninety-nine 
percent of the human race can’t 
do. They’ve got to struggle along 
using words, approximations, 
semaphore signals, and you go 
straight to the core of meaning. 
How can you pretend you’re 
isolated?” 

“The information I get is use- 
less,” Selig said. “I can’t act on 
it. I might just as well not be read- 
ing it in.” 

“Why?” 

“Because it’s just voyeurism. I’m 
spying on them. Sometimes I see 
myself as a kind of leech. A para- 
site. A vampire.” 

“You feel guilty about that?” 

“Don’t you?” 

“I didn’t ask for my gift,” Ny- 
quist said. “I just happen to have 
it. Since I have it, I use it. I like 
it. I like the life I lead. I like my- 
self. Why don’t you like yourself, 
Selig?” 

“You tell me.” 

But Nyquist had nothing to tell 
him and when Selig had finished 
his drink he went back downstairs. 
His own apartment seemed so 
strange to him as he reentered it 



that he spent a few minutes hand- 
ling familiar artifacts, his parents’ 
photograph, his little collection of 
adolescent love-letters, the plastic 
toy that the psychiatrist had given 
him years ago. He felt so jarred by 
the meeting, so intruded upon, 
that he resolved never to see Ny- 
quist again, in fact to move some- 
where else as soon as possible, to 
Manhattan, to Philadelphia, to 
Los Angeles, any place that might 
be beyond Nyquist’s reach. All his 
life he had yearned to meet some- 
one who shared his gift and now 
that he had he felt threatened. 
Nyquist was so much in control 
of his life that it was terrifying. 
He’ll humiliate me, Selig thought. 
He’ll devour me. But that panic 
faded. Two days later Nyquist 
came around to ask him out to 
dinner. They ate in a nearby Mexi- 
can restaurant and got smashed 
on Carta Blanca. It still appeared 
to Selig that Nyquist was toying 
with him, teasing him, holding him 
at arm’s length and tickling him— 
but it was all done so amiably that 
Selig felt no resentment. Nyquist’s 
charm was irresistible and his 
strength was worth taking as a 
model of behavior. Nyquist was 
like an older brother who had 
preceded him through this same 
vale of traumas and had emerged 
unscathed long ago — now he was 
jollying Selig into an acceptance 
of the terms of his existence. The 
superhuman condition, Nyquist 
called it.

T hey became close friends. 

Two or three times a week they 
went out together, ate together, 
drank together. Selig had always 
imagined that a friendship with 
someone else of his kind would be 
uniquely intense, but this was not — 
after the first week they took their 
specialness for granted and rarely 
discussed the gift they shared, nor 
did they ever congratulate each 
other on having formed an alliance 
against the ungifted world around 
them. They communicated some- 
times by words, sometimes by the 
direct contact of minds. It became 
an easy, cheerful relationship, 
strained only when Selig slipp^ 
into his habitual brooding mood 
and Nyquist mocked him for such 
self-indulgence. Even that was no 
difficulty between them until the 
blizzard — then all their tensions 
became exaggerated because they 
were spending so much time 
together. 

“Hold out your glass,” Nyquist 
said. 

He poured an amber splash of 
bourbon. Selig settled back to 
drink while Nyquist set about find- 
ing girls for them. The project took 
him five minutes. He scanned the 
building and turned up a pair of 
roommates on the fifth floor. 
“Take a look,” he said to Selig. 
Selig entered Nyquist’s mind. Ny- 
quist had attuned himself to the 
consciousness of one of the girls — 
sensual, sleepy, kittenish — and 

was looking through her eyes at 



the other, a tall gaunt blonde. The 
doubly refracted mental image 
nevertheless was quite clear — the 
blonde had a leggy voluptuousness 
and fashion-model poise. “That 
one’s mine,” Nyquist said. “Now 
tell me if you like yours.” He 
jumped, Selig following along, to 
the mind of the blonde. Yes, a 
fashion model, more intelligent 
than the other girl, cold, selfish, 
passionate. From her mind, via 
Nyquist, came the image of her 
roommate, sprawled out on a sofa 
in a pink housecoat — a short plump 
redhead, breasty, full-faced. 
“Sure,” Selig said. “Why not?” 
Nyquist, rummaging through 
minds, found the girls’ phone num- 
ber, called, worked his charm. 
They came up for drinks. “This 
awful snowstorm,” the blonde said, 
shuddering. “It can drive you 
crazy!” The four of them went 
through a lot of liquor to a tinkling 
jazz accompaniment: Mingus, 

MJQ, Chico Hamilton. The red- 
head was better-looking than 
Selig had expected, not quite so 
plump or coarse — the double re- 
fraction must have introduced 
some distortions — but she giggled 
too much and he found himself 
disliking her to some degree. Still, 
there was no backing out now. 
Eventually, very late in the evening, 
they coupled off, Nyquist and the 
blonde in the bedroom, Selig and 
the redhead in the living room. 

About the time he realized the 
redhead was too drunk to perform.

Selig felt a tickle in his skull — Ny- 
quist was probing him. This show 
of curiosity, this voyeurism, seemed 
an odd diversion for the usually 
self-contained Nyquist. Spying’s 
my trick, Selig thought, and for a 
moment he was disturbed. Then: 
This has no deep significance, he 
told himself. Nyquist is wholly 
amoral and does what he pleases, 
peeks here and peeks there without 
regard for propriety — why should 
I let his scanning bother me? Re- 
covering, he reciprocated the probe. 
Nyquist welcomed him: 

— How you doing, Davey? 

— Fine. Just fine. 

— I got me a hot one here. Take 
a look. 

Selig envied Nyquist’s cool de- 
tachment. Nyquist, pausing a 
moment to detect and isolate Se- 
lig’s sense of uneasiness, mocked 
it gently. You’re worried that 
there’s some kind of latent gayness 
in this thing, Nyquist told him. But 
1 think what really scares you is 
contact, any sort of contact. Right? 
Wrong, Selig said, but he had felt 
the point hit home. Soon afterward 
their contact ceased. 

Nyquist came into the living 
room half an hour later, the blonde 
with him. He didn’t bother to 
knock, which surprised the redhead 
a little. Nyquist put on some music 
and they all sat quietly, Selig and 
the redhead working on the bour- 
bon, Nyquist and the blonde nip- 
ping into the Scotch. Toward dawn, 
as the snow began to slacken, the 



redhead fumbled for her clothes. 
At the door, wobbling and stag- 
gering, making a boozy farewell, 
she let something slip. In vino 
veritas. “I can’t help thinking 
there’s something peculiar about 
you two guys. You aren’t a couple 
of queers, by any chance?”

I TRIED to be good to Judith, 1 
tried to be kind and loving, but 
our hatred kept coming between 
us. I said to myself. She’s my kid 
sister, my only sibling, I must love 
her more. But you can’t will love. 
You can’t conjure it into existence 
on nothing more than good inten- 
tions. Besides, my intentions had 
never been that good. 1 saw her as 
a rival from the word go. I was the 
firstborn, I was the difficult one, 
the maladjusted one. I was sup- 
posed to be the center of every- 
thing. Those were the terms of my 
contract with God — I must suffer 
because I am different, but by way 
of compensation the entire universe 
will revolve about me. The girl baby 
who was brought into the house- 
hold was intended to be nothing 
more than a therapeutic aid de- 
signed to help me relate better to 
the human race. That was the deal. 
She wasn’t supposed to have inde- 
pendent reality as a person, she 
wasn’t supposed to have her own 
needs or make demands or drain 
away parental love. Just a thing, 
an item of furniture. But I knew 



DYING INSIDE

better than to believe that. I was 
ten years old, remember, when they 
adopted her. Your ten-year-old, 
he’s no fool. I knew my parents, 
no longer feeling obliged now to 
direct all their concern exclusively 
toward their mysteriously intense 
and troubled son, would rapidly 
and with great relief transfer their 
attention and their love — yes, 
particularly their love — to the 
cuddly, uncomplicated infant. She 
would take my place at the center — 
I would become a quirky obsoles- 
cent artifact. Do you blame me 
for trying to kill her in her bassi- 
net? On the other hand you can 
understand the origin of her lifelong 
coldness toward me. I offer no 
defense at this late date. The cycle 
of hatred began with me. With 
me, Jude, with me, with me, with 
me. You could have broken it with 
love, though, if you had wanted to. 
You didn’t want to. 

On a Saturday afternoon in 
May, 1961, I went out to my par- 
ents’ house. In those years I didn’t 
go there often, though 1 lived 
twenty minutes away by subway. 
I was outside the family circle, 
autonomous and remote, and I 
felt a powerful resistance to any 
kind of reattachment. For one 
thing I had free-floating hostilities 
toward my parents — their fluky 
genes, after all, had sent me into 
the world this way. And then, too, 
there was Judith, shriveling me 
with her disdain — did I need more 
of that? So I stayed away from the 



three of them for weeks, months at 
a time, until the melancholy ma- 
ternal phone calls became too much 
for me, until the weight of my guilt 
overcame my resistance. 

1 was happy to discover, when I 
got there, that Judith was still in 
her bedroom, asleep. At three in 
the afternoon? Well, my mother 
said, she had been out late last night 
on a date. Judith was sixteen. I 
imagined her going to a high school 
basketball game with some skinny 
pimply kid and sipping milkshakes 
afterwards. Sleep well, sister, sleep 
on and on. But of course her ab- 
sence put me into direct and un- 
shielded confrontation with my sad 
and depleted parents. My mother, 
mild and dim, my father, weary and 
bitter. All my life they had steadily 
grown smaller. They seemed very 
small now. The seemed close to the 
vanishing point. 

I had never lived in this apart- 
ment. For years Paul and Martha 
had struggled with the upkeep of a 
three-bedroom place they couldn’t 
afford, simply because it had be- 
come impossible for Judith and me 
to share the same bedroom once 
she was past her infancy. The mo- 
ment I left for college, taking a 
room near campus, they found a 
smaller and far less expensive one. 
Their bedroom was to the right of 
the entry foyer and Judith’s, down 
a long hall and past the kitchen, 
was to the left. Straight ahead was 
the living room, in which my father 
sat dreamily leafing through the

Times. He read nothing but the 
newspaper these days, though once 
his mind had been more active. 
From him came a dull sludgy 
emanation of fatigue. He was mak- 
ing some decent money for the first 
time in his life, actually would end 
up quite prosperous, yet he had 
conditioned himself to the poor- 
man psychology: poor Paul, you’re 
a pitiful failure — you deserved so 
much better from life. I looked at 
the newspaper through his mind as 
he turned the pages. Yesterday

his head. “What do I know about 
horses?” he said. He was, 1 real- 
ized, already dead, although in fact 
his heart would beat for another 
decade. He had stopped respond- 
ing. The world had defeated him. 

1 left him to his brooding and 
made polite talk with my mother: 
her Hadassah reading group was 
discussing To Kill a Mockingbird 
next Thursday and she wanted to 
know if I had read it. 1 hadn’t. 
What was 1 doing with myself? 
Had I seen any good movies? 
L’Avventura, I said. Is that a 
French film, she asked? Italian, I 
said. She wanted me to describe 
the plot. She listened patiently, 
looking troubled, not following 
anything. “Who did you go with?” 
she asked. “Are you seeing any 
nice girls?” My son the bachelor. 
Already twenty-six and not even 
engaged. 1 deflected the tiresome 
question with patient skill born of 
long experience. Sorry, Martha. 1 
won’t give you the grandchildren 
you’re waiting for. 

“I have to baste the chicken 
now,” she said and disappeared. I 
sat with my father for a while, 
until 1 couldn’t stand that, and went 
down the hall to the john, next to 
Judith’s room. Her door was ajar. 
I glanced in. Lights off, blinds 
drawn, but 1 touched her mind and

found that she was awake and 
thinking of getting up. All right, 
make a gesture, be friendly, Duvid. 
It won’t cost you anything. I 
knocked lightly. “Hi, it’s me,” I 
said. “Okay if I come in?” 

S HE was sitting up, yawning, 
stretching. Her face, usually so 
taut, was puffy from too much 
sleep. From force of habit I went 
into her mind, and saw something 
new and surprising there. My sis- 
ter’s erotic inauguration. The night 
before. The whole thing: the scurry 
in the parked car, the rise of excite- 
ment, the sudden realization that 
this was going to be more than an 
interlude of petting, the panties 
coming down, the awkward shift- 
ings of position, the moment of 
ultimate hesitation giving way to 
total willingness, the body against 
body, the quick explosion, the 
messy aftermath, the guilt and con- 
fusion and disappointment as it 
ended with Judith still unsatisfied. 
The drive home, silent, shamefaced. 
Into the house, tiptoe, hoarsely 
greeting the vigilant, unsleeping 
parents. The late night shower. 
Uneasy sleep, frequently punc- 
tured. A long stretch of wakeful- 
ness, in which the night’s event is 
considered: she is pleased and 
relieved to have entered woman- 
hood, but also frightened. Unwil- 
lingness to rise and face the world 
the next day, especially to face Paul 
and Martha. Judith, your secret is 
no secret to me. 



“How are you?” I asked. 

Stagily casual, she drawled, 
“Sleepy. I was out very late. How 
come you’re here?” 

“I drop in to see the family now 
and then.” 

“Nice to have seen you.” 

“That isn’t friendly, Jude. Am 1 
that loathsome |o you?” 

“Why are you bothering me, 
Duv?” 

“I told you. I’m trying to be 
sociable. You’re my only sister, 
the only one I’ll ever have. I 
thought I’d stick my head in the 
door and say hello.” 

“You’ve done that. So?” 

“You might tell me what you’ve 
been doing with yourself since the 
last time I saw you.” 

“Do you care?” 

“If I didn’t care, would I ask?” 
“Sure,” she said. “You don’t 
give a crap about what I’ve been 
doing. You don’t give a crap about 
anybody but David Selig and why 
pretend otherwise? You don’t need 
to ask me polite questions. They 
aren’t natural coming from you.” 
“Hey, hold on!” Let’s not be 
duelling so fast, sister. “What gives 
you the idea that — ” 

“Do you think of me from one 
week to the next? I’m just furniture 
to you. The drippy little sister. The 
brat. The inconvenience. Have you 
ever talked to me? About anything? 
Do you even know the name of the 
school I go to? I’m a total stranger

“What the hell do you know 
about me?” 

“Plenty.” 

“For example.” 

“Quit it, Jude.” 

“One example. Just one. One 
thing about me. For example — ” 
“For example. All right. For 
example, I know that you got laid 
last night.” 

We were both amazed by that. 1 
stood in shocked silence, not be- 
lieving that I had allowed those 
words to pass my lips — and Judith 
jerked as though electrified, her 
body stiffening and rearing, her 
eyes blazing with astonishment. I 
don’t know how long we remained 
frozen, unable to speak. 

“What?” she said finally. “What 
did you say, Duv?” 

“You heard it.” 

“I heard it but I think I must 
have dreamed it. Say it again.” 
“No.” 

“Why not?” 

“Leave me alone, Jude.” 

“Who told you?” 

“Please, Jude — ” 

“ Who told youT' 

“Nobody,” 1 muttered. 

Her smile was terrifyingly trium- 
phant. “You know something? I 
believe you. I honestly believe you. 
Nobody told you. You pulled it 
right out of my mind, didn’t you, 
Duv?” 

“I wish 1 had never come in 
here.” 

“Admit it. Why won’t you admit 
it? You see into people’s minds. 



don’t you, Duvid? You’re some 
kind of circus freak. I’ve suspected 
that a long time. All those little 
hunches you have — and they al- 
ways turn out to be right — and the 
embarrassed phony way you cover 
up for yourself when you’re right. 
Talking about your ‘luck’ at guess- 
ing things. Sure! Sure, luck! I knew 
the real scoop. I said to myself. 
This bastard is reading my mind. 
But I told myself it was crazy, 
there aren’t any such people — it 
has to be impossible. Only it’s 
true, isn’t it? You don’t guess. You 
look. We’re wide open to you and 
you read us like books. Spying on 
us. Isn’t that so?” 

“Stop it, Jude.” 

“You didn’t answer my other 
question. You’ve got this weird 
power, don’t you? Don’t youT' 

“Yes.” 

“And you’ve been secretly spying 
on people all your life.” 

“Yes. Yes.” 

“I knew it. I didn’t know — but I 
really did, all along. And it ex- 
plains so much. Why I always felt 
dirty when 1 was a kid and you 
were around. Why I felt as if any- 
thing I did was likely to show up 
in tomorrow’s newspapers. I never 
had any privacy, even when 1 was 
locked in the bathroom. I didn’t 
feel private.” She shuddered. “I 
hope I never see you again, Duv. 
Now that I know what you are. I

my head after this. I’ll — ”

1 stumbled away. In the bath- 
room I gripped the cold edge of the 
sink and leaned close to the mirror 
to study my flushed, flustered face. 
1 looked stunned and dazed, my 
features as rigid as though I had 
had a stroke. / know that you got 
laid last night. Why had 1 told her 
that? An accident? The words spill- 
ing out of me because she had 
goaded me past the point of pru- 
dence? But I had never let anyone 
push me into a revelation like that 
before. There are no accidents, 
Freud said. There are never any 
slips of the tongue. Everything’s 
deliberate on one level or another. 
1 must have said what I did to 
Judith because 1 wanted her at 
last to know the truth about me. 
But why? Why her? I had told Ny- 
quist, yes — there could be no risk 
in that — but I had never admitted 
it to anyone else. And now Judith 
knew. I had given her a weapon 
with which she could destroy me. 

I had given her a weapon. How 
strange that she never chose to use 
it.

I REMAIN on dead center. 

Becalmed, static, anchored. 
No, that’s a lie, or if not a lie then 
at the very least a benign misstate- 
ment, a faulty cluster of metaphors. 
1 am ebbing. My tide is going out. 
I am revealed as a bare rocky 
shore, iron-hard, with trailing 
streamers of dirty brown seaweed 



dangling toward the absenting 
surf. Green crabs scuttling about. 
Yes, I ebb, which is to say I 
diminish, 1 attenuate. Do you 
know, 1 feel quite calm about it 
now? Of course my moods fluctu- 
ate but 

I feel 

Quite calm 

About it now. 

This is the third year since first 
I began to recede from myself. 
I think it started in the spring of 
1974. Until then it worked fault- 
lessly, I mean the power, always 
there when I had occasion to call 
upon it, always dependable, doing 
all its customary tricks, serving me 
in all my dirty needs — and then 
without warning, without reason, 
it began dying. Little failures of 
input. Tiny episodes of psychic 
impotence. I would be snug and 
smug inside someone’s head, 
scanning scandals thought to be 
safely hidden, and suddenly every- 
thing would blur and become un- 
certain. Rather like reading the 
Times and having the text abruptly 
turn to Joycean dream-gabble 

between one line and the next, so 
that a straightforward dreary 

account of the latest Presidential 
fact-finding commission’s finding 
of futile facts metamorphosed 
into a foggy impenetrable report 
on old Earwicker’s borborygmi. 
At such times I would falter and 
pull out in fear. What would you 
do if you believed you were in bed 
with your heart’s desire and

awakened to find yourself screwing 
a starfish? But these unclarities and 
distortions were not the worst 
part — I think the inversions 
were, the total reversal of signal. 
Such as picking up a flash of love 
when what was really being radi- 
ated was frosty hatred. Or vice 
versa. When that happens— and it 
had — 1 want to pound on walls 
to test reality. From Judith one 
day I got strong waves of sexual 
desire, an overpowering incestuous 
yearning that cost me a fine 
dinner as I ran nauseated and 
retching to the bowl. All an error, 
all a deception — she was aiming 
spears at me and I took them for 
Cupid’s arrows, more fool 1. Well, 
after that I got blank spaces, tiny 
deaths of perception in mid- 
contact. And after those came 
mingled imputs, crossed wires, 
two minds coming in at once and 
me unable to tell the which from 
the which. For a time the color 
appercept dropped out, though 
that has come back, one of the 
many false returns. And there 
were other losses, barely discerni- 
ble ones but cumulative in their 
effect. I make lists now of the 
things 1 once could do that I can 
do no longer. Inventories of the 
shrinkage. Like a dying man 
confined to his bed, paralyzed but 
observant, watching his relatives 
pilfer his goods. This day the 
television set has gone, this day 
the Thackeray first editions, this 
day the spoons — and now they 



have made off with my Piranesis 
and tomorrow it will be the pots 
and pans, the Venetian blinds, my 
neckties and my trousers and by 
next week they will be taking toes, 
intestines, corneas, testicles, lungs 
and nostrils. What will they use my 
nostrils for? 1 used to fight back 
with long walks, cold showers, 
tennis, massive doses of Vitamin 
A, and other hopeful, implausible 
remedies — and more recently I 
experimented with fasting and 
pure thoughts, but such struggling 
now seems to me inappropriate and 
even blasphemous. These days I 
strive toward cheerful acceptance 
of loss — with such success as you 
may have already perceived. I 
accept, I accept. Do you see that 
quality of acceptance growing in 
me? Make no mistake — I am 
sincere. This morning, at least, 1 
am well on my way to acceptance, 
as golden autumn sunlight floods 
my room and expands my tattered 
soul. I lie here practicing the 
techniques that will make me 
invulnerable to the knowledge that 
it’s all fleeing from me. 1 search 
for the joy that I know lies buried 
in the awareness of decline. Grow 
old along with me! The best is 
yet to be. The last of life, for 
which the first was made. Do you 
believe that? I believe that. I’m 
getting better at believing all 
sorts of things. Why, sometimes 
I’ve believed as many as six 
impossible things before breakfast. 
Good old Browning!

Then welcome each rebuff 
That turns earth's smoothness 
rough, 

Each sting that bids nor sit nor 
stand, but go! 

Be our joys three parts pain! 
Strive, and hold cheap the strain. 

Yes. Of course. And be our 
pains three parts joy, he might 
have added. Such joy this morning. 
And it’s all fleeing from me, all 
ebbing. Going out of me from 
every pore. 

Silence is coming over me. I will 
speak to no one after it’s gone. 
And no one will speak to me. 

N aturally i feei some 
sorrow over what’s happen- 
ing — 1 feel regret, anger and 
frustration and despair, but also, 
strangely, I feel shame. My cheeks 
burn, my eyes will not meet other 
eyes, I can hardly face my fellow 
mortals for the shame of it, as if 
something precious had been 
entrusted to me and I had failed 
in my trusteeship. I must say to 
the world. I’ve wasted my assets. 
I’ve squandered my patrimony. 
I’ve let it slip away, going, going. 
I’m a bankrupt now, a bankrupt. 
Perhaps this is a family trait, this 
embarrassment when disaster 
comes. We Seligs like to tell the 
world we are orderly people, 
captains of our souls, and when 
something external downs us we 
are abashed. I remember when 



my parents briefly owned a car, 
a dark green 1948 Chevrolet 
purchased at some absurdly low 
price in 1950, and we were driving 
somewhere deep in Queens, per- 
haps on our way to my grand- 
mother’s grave, the annual 
pilgrimage, and a car emerged 
from a blind alley and hit us. A 
drunk at the wheel. Nobody hurt, 
but our fender badly crumpled and 
our grille broken. Though the 
accident was in no way his fault 
my father reddened and reddened, 
transmitting feverish embarrass- 
ment, as though he were apologiz- 
ing to the universe for having 
done anything so thoughtless as 
allowing his car to be hit. How 
he apologized to the other driver, 
too, my grim bitter father! It’s 
all right, it’s all right, accidents 
can happen — you mustn’t feel up- 
set about it, see, we’re all okay! 
I feared my father was going to 
give him money for the repairs, 
but my mother, fearing the 
same thing, headed him off at the 
pass. A week later he was still 
embarrassed — I popped into his 
mind while he was talking with 
a friend and found him trying to 
pretend my mother had been 
driving, which was absurd — she 
never had a license — and then 
I felt embarrassed for him. Judith, 
too, when her marriage broke 
up, when she walked out on an 
impossible situation, registered 
enormous grief over the shameful 
fact that someone so purposeful

T ake an imaginary letter, Mr. 

Selig. Harrumph. Miss Kitty 
Holstein, Something West Sixty- 
something Street, New York City. 
Check the address later. Don’t 
bother about the zipcode. 

Dear Kitty: 

I know you haven’t heard 
from me in ages but 1 think 
now it’s appropriate to try to 
get in touch with you again. 
Thirteen years have passed and 
a certain maturity must have 
come over both of us, 1 think, 
healing old wounds and making 
communication possible. De- 
spite all hard feelings that may 
once have existed between us 
I never lost my fondness for 
you, and you remain bright in 
my mind. 

Speaking of my mind, 
there’s something I ought to 



tell you. I no longer do things 
very well with it. By “things” 
1 mean the mental deal, the 
mind-reading trick, which of 
course 1 couldn’t do on you in 
any case, but which defined 
and shaped my relationship 
to everybody else in the world. 
This power seems to be 
slipping away from me now. 
It caused us so much grief, 
remember? It was what 
ultimately split us up, as I 
tried to explain in my last 
letter to you, the one you 
never answered. In another 
year or so — who knows, six 
months, a month, a week? — 
it will be totally gone and I 
will be just an ordinary human 
being like yourself. 1 will be 
a freak no longer. Perhaps 
then there will be an op- 
portunity for us to resume the 
relationship that was inter- 
rupted in 1963 and to reestab- 
lish it on a more realistic 
footing. 

I know I did dumb things 
then. 1 pushed you mercilessly. 
I refused to accept you for 
yourself and tried to make 
something else out of you, 
something freakish, in fact, 
something just like myself. 1 
had good reasons in theory 
for attempting that, 1 thought 
then, but of course they 
were wrong, they had to be 
wrong and I never saw that 
until it was too late. To

you I seemed domineering, 
overpowering, dictatorial — me, 
mild self-effacing me! Be- 
cause I was trying to transform 
you. And eventually I bored 
you. Of course you were very 
young then, you were — shall 
I say it? — shallow, unformed, 
and you resisted me. But now 
that we’re both adults we 
might be able to make a go of 
it. 

1 hardly know what my life 
will be like as an ordinary 
human being unable to enter 
minds. Right now I’m floun- 
dering, looking for definitions 
of myself, looking for struc- 
tures. I’m thinking seriously 
of entering the Roman Catho- 
lic Church. 

(Good Christ, am I? That’s the 
first I’ve heard of that! The stink 
of incense, the mumble of priests, 
is that what I want?) 

Or perhaps the Episcopalian, 
I don’t know. It’s a matter of 
affiliating myself with the 
human race. And also I want 
to fall in love again. I want to 
be part of someone else. I’ve 
already begun tentatively, 
timidly getting in touch with 
my sister Judith again after a 
whole lifetime of warfare. 
We’re starting to relate to 
each other for the first time 
and that’s encouraging to me. 
But 1 need more — a woman to 



love, not just sexually but in 
all ways. I’ve really had that 
only twice in my life, once with 
you, once about five years 
later with a girl named Toni 
who wasn’t very much like 
you, and both times this 
power of mine ruined things 
— once because I got too close 
with it, once because 1 
couldn’t get close enough. As 
the power slips away from me, 
as it dies, perhaps there’s a 
chance for an ordinary human 
relationship between us at 
last, of the kind that ordinary 
human beings have all the 
time. For I wilt be ordinary. 
For I will be very ordinary. 

I wonder about you. You’re 
thirty-five years old now, I 
think. That sounds ve^ old 
to me, even though I’m forty- 
one. (Forty-one doesn’t sound 
old, somehow!) I still think of 
you as being twenty-two. You 
seemed even younger than that 
— sunny, open, naive. Of 
course that was my fantasy 
image of you. 1 had nothing to 
go by but externals — 1 
couldn’t do my usual number 
on your psyche — and so I 
made up a Kitty who probably 
wasn’t the real Kitty at all. 
Anyway, so you’re thirty-five. 
I imagine you look younger 
than that today. Did you 
marry? Of course you did. A 
happy marriage? Lots of 
kids? Are you still married?

What’s your married name,

Somehow I don’t think you

wife — does that insult you? 
So there ought to be room in 
your life for me as a friend — 
as a lover. Do you ever see 
Tom Nyquist? Did you go on 
seeing him for long after you 
and 1 broke up? Were you 
bitter toward me for the things 
1 told you about him in that 
letter? If your marriage has 
broken up or if somehow you 
never married, would you 
live with me now? Not as a

through the last phases of 
what’s happening to me? I need 
help so much. 1 need love. I

1 direct you to his Four Quartets, 
to his paradoxical line, “In my 
beginning is my end,” which he 
amplifies some pages later with 
the comment, “What we call the 
beginning is often the end/ And to 
make an end is to make a begin- 
ning.” Some of us are ending 
right now, dear children, that is to 
say, aspects of lives that once 
were central to the possessors are 
drawing to a close. Is this an end 
or is it a beginning? Can the end 
of one thing not be the beginning of 
another? I think so, beloved ones. 
I think that the closing of a door 
does not preclude the opening of a 
different door. Of course, it takes 
courage to walk through that new 
door when we do not know what 
may lie beyond it, but one who has 
faith need have no fears. Our 
lives are pilgrimages. We may die 
small deaths every day, but we 
are reborn from death to death, 
until at last we go into the dark, 
into the vacant interstellar spaces 
where He awaits us — and why 
should we fear if He is there? And 
until that time comes let us live our 
lives without giving way to the 
temptation to grieve for ourselves. 
Remember always that the world 
still is full of wonders, that there 
are always new quests, that 
seeming ends are not ends in 
truth, but only transitions, stations 
by the way. Why should we mourn? 
Why should we give ourselves over 
to sorrow, though our lives be 
daily subtractions? If we lose 



this, do we also lose thatl If 
sight goes, does love go also? If 
feeling grows faint, may we not 
return to old feelings and draw 
comfort from them? Much of our 
pain is mere confusion. 

Be then of good cheer on this Our 
Lord’s day, beloved ones, and 
spin no snares in which to catch 
yourselves, nor allow yourselves 
the self-indulgent sin of misery, 
and make no false distinctions 
between ends and beginnings, but 
go onward, ever searching, to new 
ecstasies, to new communions, to 
new worlds, and give no space in 
your soul to fear, but yield yourself 
up to the Peace of Christ and await 
that which must come. 

Now comes a dark equinox out 
of its proper moment. The 
bleached moon glimmers like a 
wretched old skull. The leaves 
shrivel and fall. The fires die 
down. The dove, wearying, flutters 
to earth. Darkness spreads. Every- 
thing blows away. The purple blood 
falters in the narrowing veins; the 
chill impinges on the straining 
heart; the soul dwindles; even the 
feet become untrustworthy. Words 
fail. Our guides admit they are 
lost. That which has been solid 
grows transparent. Things pass 
away. Colors fade. This is a gray 
time and I fear it will be grayer 
still one of these days. Tenants of 
the house, thoughts of a dry 
brain in a dry season.

FAREWELL TO THE ARTIFACTS 



SANDY FISHER 



AT TWO A.M., the phone woke 
AX me. The caller was Emelin 
and before he had gotten out two 
words I knew that he was extremely 
annoyed. “Damn it, Poekel,” he 
shouted down the wire, “your 
vacuum cleaner is over here trying 
to mount Phyl’s sewing machine.” 
1 winced inwardly. Sighing, I 
said, “Look, Harry, it’s young— 



it just doesn’t know any better.” 

“I realize it doesn't know any 
better, but look — 1 still don’t 
like that going on in front of the 
kids.” 

“Well, I’ll be right there and 
bring it back.” 

I got out of bed and threw on 
some clothes. Martha sat up and 
looked at me sleepily. “It’s noth- 



77 



ing,” I told her. “The vacuum 
cleaner got out again.” 

“Did it go over to the Emelins’?” 
she asked, brushing the hair out of 
her eyes. 

“It’s over there now, humping 
their sewing machine.” 

She made a disgusted sound, 
lying down and turning over. 

I turned out the bedroom light, 
went downstairs quietly to avoid 
waking the kids, opened the front 
door. The night chill cleaned my 
throat, my breath making little 
puffs of frost in the streetlights. 1 
trotted over to the Emelins’. The 
porch light was on and Harry was 
waiting for me outside. 

“Awfully sorry,” I said ruefully 
as I panted up the porch steps. 

“Can’t you keep the door 
locked?” Harry asked. 

“I do. The damn thing’s learned 
how to undo the latch.” 

“You probably don’t punish it 
properly.” 

We went inside. Phyllis, Harry’s 
wife, met us in the hallway, wrap- 
ped in a robe. 

“Hi, Poke,” she said. “I’m sorry 
Harry was so short on the phone, 
but I really blew up and upset him. 
1 guess the thing startled me.” 

“That’s okay,” I said. “Where 
is it?” 

She glanced toward the kitchen. 
“Well, it sort of gave up on the 
sewing machine. Now it’s sort of 



sniffing around the kitchen.” 
“What’s it looking for?” 

“I’m damned if I know.” 

We marched into the kitchen, 
Phyllis leading the way. Sure 
enough, the vacuum was working 
its way down the side wall, its 
hose snuffling along the baseboard 
crack. “Come on, Herman,” I 
said. “Time to go home.” I scooped 
it up in my arms and it began to 
snuffle my ear. “It didn’t dirty the 
house or anything, did it?” I asked 
on the way to the door. 

“Oh, no,” Phyllis said. “It just 
startled me, getting in tike that.” 
“Maybe it got in when you 
opened the door for something 
else.” 

She shook her head. “1 would 
have seen it.” 

“Well, we can talk about it 
tomorrow. Sorry again, Phyllis. 
’Night, Harry.” 

“ ’Night, Poke.” 

They watched me down the steps, 
then closed the door. A minute 
later the porch light went out. 1 
homed on our porch light, holding 
the gently squirming vacuum 
cleaner in my arms. “A hell of 
a thing to do,” I said to it. “Why 
the hell won’t you stay home?” 
Obviously it wanted a mate. On 
top of that it seemed to be a little 
confused about its identity. A 
sewing machine — now that was 
pretty far-fetched. Since this

whole peculiar business had begun 
a few weeks ago I had been a little 
nervous about what appliance was 
going to start up next. Some could 
be downright uncomfortable to 
have clomping around the house. 
The furnace, for example. 

I dropped the vacuum gently on 
the kitchen floor. “Now, listen,” 
1 told it. “No more funny business 
tonight. You go to sleep — over 
here, on your beddy-bye.” I 
indicated the pile of old clothes I’d 
made into a sort of nest. 

The vacuum trundled over to the 
pile, obediently hopped on it and 
tucked its hose around itself. 

1 got softhearted. Rummaging 
around in the canisters on the 
sideboard, I came up with a handful 
of peanuts. “Here,” I said, holding 
them out on my palm. “Peace 
offering.” 

The vacuum snaked its hose over 
to my hand, investigated delicately, 
then snorked up the peanuts. Then 
it whuffled appreciatively, snug- 
ged down on the clothing and went 
inert. 

“I bet you’re faking,” I said to 
it, “but stay out of trouble 
anyway.” 

I went out, closed the kitchen 
door and turned out the light. Then 
I locked the cellar door and put the 
key on top of the door frame. 1 
spent a few minutes at the front 
door, trying to figure a way to lock 



it so that the clever little devil 
couldn’t open it. Finally I re- 
opened the basement door, went 
downstairs, pawed through a 
couple of dingy bottles of nails and 
screws and came up with a plastic 
baggie containing a hook and eye. 
I took it back upstairs and instal- 
led it on the front door, well up 
near the top corner where the 
vacuum couldn’t reach it. 

When I got back into bed Martha 
asked sleepily, “Did it break 
anything?” 

“Uh-uh.” 

“Wee-wee all over the living 
room rug?” 

“Of course not. How could it?” 

“How the hell would I know? 
It’s pretty good at almost every- 
thing else.” 

I grunted, turned off the light. 

W 'E WERE having our coffee 
next morning when the phone 
rang. “Morning,” I said absently 
into it. 

“Mr. Poekel, this is the Los 
Angeles Times. 1 wonder if you’d 
mind talking to one of our people 
about what’s happening out there?” 
“Listen, Tm sorry if you’ve been 
misled,” I said into the handset. 
“There’s nothing going on here at 
all. Somebody’s playing a practical 
joke on you and you ought to get 
wise to it.”

“Come off it, Mr. Poekel.” 
“God’s honest truth,” I said. 
“Listen, one of my neighbors, 
Harry Emelin, is playing a practi- 
cal joke on me by telling everybody 
that I’m building robots here. 
There isn’t a word of truth in the 
story.” Idly I watched the coffee 
pot climb down into the sink, push 
the tap open with its spout and 
wallow contentedly in the water. 
“Is that a fact?” 

“Fact. Listen, fellas. I’m just a 
plain old funeral director, just 
another joe trying to live my life 
and make a buck. This sort of 
publicity is bad for business. You 
know how quiet the profession is 
supposed to be. 

“I didn’t realize that.” 

“Matter of fact,” I said, warming 
to my subject, “the board of 
examiners is considering censuring 
me because of all the publicity 
this joke has been giving me. I 
would appreciate it if you boys 
would give me a break.” I didn’t 
quite cry into the phone. Martha 
nodded approvingly. 

“Well, we really didn’t have any 
idea . good authority ... we 
thought . sorry to bother you.” 
“No trouble. And thank you so 
much for your cooperation. If 
you ever need anything in my line 
don’t hesitate to call. I’ll return 
your kindness a thousandfold. 
They say I’m quite an artist.” 



“Uh, thanks.” 

“Don’t mention it.” I hung up. 

“Wasn’t that a little thick?” 
Martha asked. 

“Nah.” 

“Suppose they think to check 
that funeral director thing?” 

1 slapped my forehead, which 
emitted a sound like a smitten 
cantaloupe. “Migod!” 

“I’ll cover for you,” the love of 
my life said sweetly. “If they call 
back I’ll tell them you’ve gone out 
of town.” 

“For what?” 

“For a mortician’s convention.” 
She stood up, walked to the sink, 
picked up the coffee pot, paddled 
it and put it back on the sideboard, 
where it hobbled behind a canister 
of coffee to sulk. She sighed, took 
a sponge and began to wipe the 
sink — the walls around it and the 
floor in front of it were covered 
with water that the coffee pot had 
splashed up. 

The phone rang again. Martha 
put down the sponge and answered. 
1 mooched up behind her, put my 
arms around her and let my nose 
rest on her head. Her hair smelled 
of a curious, morning-chores mix of 
perfume and dishpan detergent. 
Reaching around behind herself, 
she dug me in the ribs with a 
forefinger. “Just a minute. I’ll 
see if he’s available,” she said into 
the phone.

I shook my head emphatically. 

She covered the mouthpiece. 
“It’s the Monsignor What’s-his- 
face,” she hissed. 

“Oh,” 1 said, accepting the 

phone. Martha uttered a little yip 
of surprise — the vacuum had ex- 
perimentally snuffled her thigh. 
She slapped at it. It shrank away, 
went about its business of snuffling 
around the baseboards. 

“Hello,” I said warily into the 
phone. 

“Monsignor Scopazzi here,” a 
fruity voice said into my ear. 

“Good to hear from you,” I said 
absently. 

“Yes. Well, regarding your situa- 
tion over there, I feel confident 
that something can be done.” 

“Glad to hear it.” 

“Yes. Of course, 1 don’t do that 
sort of thing myself, but I think 
that we can put you in touch with 
someone who is equipped to 
handle it.” 

“Great. When can I talk to him?” 

The fruity voice chuckled, mak- 
ing me think of Orson Welles as 
Cardinal Richelieu. “Patience, 
patience, my boy. Exorcists don’t 
grow on trees, not any more. We 
live in an enlightened era.” 

I looked over at the sideboard, 
where the toaster and the can 
opener were fighting over a loaf 
of bread. “Not enlightened enough 
for me.” 



“Rather than my bothering you 
again with unessential details, my 
office will take care of getting 
someone to you.” 

“Look, I appreciate this, but isn’t 
there some way you can get him 
over here right away?” 

“You sound quite disturbed,” 
the phone said. Monsignor, my 
eye! 

“I am quite disturbed.” 

There was a longish pause. 
“Well, then,” the voice came back, 
“we’ll see if something can be done 
later today. The person in question 
is somewhere in the Los Angeles 
area at this moment, I believe. 
Yes. We’ll be in touch shortly.” 
“Thank you very much.” 

“Don’t mention it. Oh, inciden- 
tally, 1 would appreciate the favor 
of being allowed to be present 
during the — ah — services.” 

“Oh?” The telephone was inno- 
cent — this was the Monsignor. I 
called to Martha, “What do we 
have to offer a Monsignor for 
dinner?” 

“Will he eat Pedernales chili?” 
she called back. 

“He’d better.” Into the phone I 
said, “No trouble at all. Monsig- 
nor, we’d be delighted to have you 
make it for dinner. That’s always 
a lively time.” 

“Thank you. The — ah — visita- 
tions sound most intriguing. Until 
later, then.”

1 HUNG up the wall handset, 
went to the sideboard and took 
the loaf of bread away from the 
toaster and the can opener. 

“What do you do to make a 
Monsignor feel at home?” Martha 
asked. 

“You could start by hiding the 
menorah.” 

The doorbell chimed. I went to 
answer it while Martha started on 
the dishes. I remembered to un- 
fasten the hook and eye at the top 
of the door. 

“Mister Poekel?” the guy with 
the notepad said. 

“Who?” 1 asked. 

“Poekel, William J.? Having 
some sort of funny trouble with 
your appliances?” 

I looked over his shoulder. At 
the curb stood one of those fairly 
new, nondescript, low-priced cars, 
unmarked, with a buggywhip 
antenna on the rear fender. 

“Sorry,” I said. “Poekel used 
to live here a few months back, 
but he’s moved. Funny little guy.” 
“Is that so?” 

“Oh, sure. He used to live in a 
little room in the attic. The missus 
and I were never sure when he went 
in or out. A little strange, maybe, 
but always polite and he always 
paid his rent on time.” 

The guy’s face fell. “You don’t 
know where we might be able to 
find him?” 



“Sorry,” I said, “I haven’t the 
faintest idea.” 

“Could you give me a description 
of him?” 

“Oh, I don’t know,” I mused. 
“He looks pretty ordinary. Maybe 
five feet four or five, sort of 
stooped over, you know? And he 
has a cast in one eye.” 

The guy glanced back at the car, 
then at me. “Well, thanks a lot, 
fella.” 

“Don’t mention it. Say, while 
you’re here, could I interest you 
in a brand-new, complete set of 
the Encyclopedia Britannica? It’s 
the universal reference source of a 
thousand uses. I can get you a real 
good price.” 

“Uh, no, thanks. I’ve got to get 
back to the paper.” 

“Well, if you change your mind 
be sure to let me know. You really 
don’t know what you’re missing.” 
“You sell those things?” 

“Best damn salesman in the 
West, the missus tells me. She 
says if I keep up at this rate I’ll 
be division manager by next year. 
Yes, sir. Then I could really get you 
a break.” 

“Uh, that’s great.” 

“Be sure to keep in touch now. 
The name’s Hendrickson, Claude 
Hendrickson. Here’s my phone 
number. Think it over and get in 
touch.” 1 wrote out a number and 
handed it to him, clapped him on

the shoulder. “Maybe you could 
use a little knowledge.” 

“Yeah. So long,” he said, back- 
ing down the steps. 

“Don’t be a stranger now, 
y’hear?” 

I watched him get back into the 
car and drive away. He didn’t stop 
at other houses on the block. That 
gave me more time. 

I WAS about to go back in when 
Harry Emelin came over. We 
said, “Hi — ” and walked into the 
kitchen. Martha was just paddling 
the can opener, which had gotten 
into the refrigerator and over- 
turned the milk. She looked at me 
in despair. “We’ve got to stop 
this,” she said. 

Harry said, “Hi, Martha.” 

“Hi, Harry. I can’t offer you 
anything but instant coffee — the 
coffee pot keeps emptying itself 
onto the floor.” 

“That’s okay,” Harry said 
graciously. “Maybe the weather 
is making it a little rambunctious.” 
We sat down at the table. Martha 
put water on the stove in a regular 
pot to boil and sat down with us. 
She rested her chin on her right 
hand and put her left hand on my 
arm. 

“Anything new?” Harry asked. 
“Not as far as I know.” 

“The blender,” Martha said. “It 
isn’t where I left it last night.” 



“You think it’s walking around?” 
“I don’t know. Maybe one of the 
other things pushed it.” 

“Who was that?” Harry asked. 
“Who — wha — ?” 

“That guy outside.” 

“Oh, him. 1 thought he was 
from the Times. That was a 
Times staff car.” 

“Did you tell him anything?” 
“Do you think I’m crazy? And 
have people crawling all over my 
home? I told him he had the wrong 
house and offered to sell him a set 
of encyclopedias.” 

“Do you think he was 
convinced?” 

“Sure. I even offered to give 
him my phone number in case he 
changed his mind.” 

“Did you?” 

“Well, 1 gave him a number. If 
he changes his mind and calls it 
the Santa Monica ASPCA will 
give him a hard time. They’ve 
never sold encyclopedias.” 

“Did you follow up that sug- 
gestion 1 made?” Harry said. 
“Which one?” 

“The one about exorcism.” 

“Oh. Yeah, 1 did. I got in touch 
with the first person who I thought 
might know — he happened to be a 
rabbi. He put me on to somebody 
in comparative mythology at 
UCSB, who put me onto a priest 
in Santa Monica. Eventually 1 
seem to have found somebody

who knows somebody. First 1 
thought the phone was playing 
tricks— but he’s supposed to 
come by for dinner tonight.” 
“Mind if 1 join you?” 

“Of course not. If you can take 
Pedernales chili, that is.” 

“I suppose I can. Did you check 
the chart recorder this morning?” 
“I did, but it was blank.” 

“Let’s see.” He stood up and 
went to the chart recorder, sitting 
on the sideboard near the refriger- 
ator. He unsnapped the cover and 
took it off. Whistling absently, he 
ran through the calibration. 
Finally he closed the cover, reat- 
tached the snaps and came back to 
the table. “It works all right. 
Hum.” 

“Well,” I said, “All that tells us 
is that there are no electromag- 
netic fields in the room.” 

“Other than the normal back- 
ground RF and sixty-cycle, yes. 
And it would be okay to guess that 
very low-frequency stuff couldn’t 
have anything to do with this.” He 
scratched his head. “I’m about 
out of ideas. I’m glad you found 
an exorcist.” 

“I’m not convinced that this is 
going to work,” I said. 

“You can always sell the house.” 
“Thanks a lot.” 

I rose and moved idly around the 
kitchen. The sun streamed in 
through the window over the sink. 



sending butter-yellow reflections 
around the clean little room. I 
looked around. Everything seemed 
normal, just like in any other tract 
house, except that, while I watched, 
the coffee pot got down into the 
sink again. It nosed the water on, 
splashed under the faucet and 
seemed to enjoy itself tremendously. 

“Have you been able to come up 
with anything unusual from back 
around the time this got started?” 
Harry asked. 

“Not yet. The first thing I 
remember still happened about a 
month ago — and it still is just my 
coming downstairs in the morning 
and finding the toaster buried in 
toasted bread. Then there was the 
night we sat here and watched it 
open the loaf and fill itself with 
slices. And after that, the can 
opener and the coffee pot and the 
vacuum cleaner — and now, God 
knows, maybe the blender. And not 
a clue during the whole time that 
might give even a hint of an idea as 
to what’s going on.” 

“What makes you think that 
exorcism is going to accomplish 
anything?” Martha asked. 

“Well, it’s been around for a 
long time.” 

“Exorcism, shmexorcism.” I 
paced the kitchen floor. “What I 
need is results. The good old- 
fashioned American spirit. No 
matter how far-fetched living in

a mechanical menagerie may seem, 
let no man say that my cause is 
hopeless.” 

«T’M AFRAID it’s hopeless,” 
A Mobutu, the exorcist, said. 
Dinner was over. It had been lively. 
He looked up wearily from a litter 
of arcane paraphernalia. 

“What do you mean, hopeless?” 
Martha asked. “Couldn't you 
have forgotten something?” 

“Well,” Mobutu said, getting 
up from the floor, “while exorcism 
isn’t exactly a full-time profession 
with me I am still a professional 
in the business. And in my opin- 
ion — exorcism is not the answer to 
this problem.” 

Mobutu was about twenty-three, 
wore a dark, impeccable business 
suit and an Afro natural. He 
scratched the natural in baffle- 
ment. 

“Isn’t there anyone else in your 
department at the university?” 
Martha asked. 

“The university? Oh. No, of 
course not,” Mobutu said. “I’m 
in the Graduate School of Law. 
There isn’t anyone else over there 
who knows anything about my 
field. Unless you feel you could use 
people without a specific back- 
ground in exorcism.” 

“Who have you got?” 

“Well, we have two Zen adepts 



and a member of the Adoratory 
of Relsa.” 

“That’s tough.” 

“I figured you’d think so.” 
Mobutu started to pack. 

“Say,” I asked, “with your 
background in law, what are you 
doing in religion? Or is the word 
occultism?” 

“Both are old interests of mine,” 
Mobutu said, still packing. “When 
I finish my graduate work here at 
the university I’m moving on to 
Oxford for another stint. In a few 
years I’ll be the only person in the 
United States with degrees in both 
civil and canon law.” 

“Urn.” 

“I’m sorry that exorcism doesn’t 
work on your — problem.” 

“That’s a polite word for it.” 
Harry, who had been looking 
on with interest, said, “Whose 
fault is that?” 

“It’s not mine — or I should say, 
not the fault of the methods of 
exorcism,” Mobutu said carefully. 
“Rather it indicates that these ob- 
jects are not being moved by malig- 
nant spirits. In other words, there 
seems to be nothing to exorcise.” 
“What do we do now?” 1 asked. 
He placed the tips of his fingers 
carefully together. “Have you 
tried a child psychologist? Pol- 
tergeist phenomena, you know — ” 
“My kids are not crazy,” Martha 
said testily. 



FAREWELL TO THE ARTIFACTS 



85 



“That’s not what he means,” 
I said. 

Mobutu nodded. “No. 1 simply 
meant that these phenomena 
frequently occur around adolescent 
female children.” 

Martha looked relieved. “We 
don’t have any girls.” 

“That’s too bad.” 

“What do you mean, too bad?” 
“Well, they might have provided 
an explanation.” 

The phone rang. Martha went 
into the kitchen and picked it up. 
In a minute she came back into the 
room. “It’s Phyllis, Harry,” she 
said. “You should have asked her 
to join us.” 

Harry took the phone. Mobutu 
started packing up his gear. The 
Monsignor shooed the vacuum 
away from under his feet and stood 
up. “I’m sorry that nothing of 
more value has come of this,” 
he said. “Nevertheless I have found 
the visit most —ah-^ interesting.” 
Harry came back into the living 
room. “What’s up?” I asked him. 

“Phyllis says our sewing machine 
is out in the living room trying to 
pull down the curtains.” 

“My God,” the Monsignor said. 
“Perhaps,” Mobutu mumbled, 
packing his gear. 

In the kitchen Martha let out a 
tiny shriek. I hurried in, followed 
by Harry and Mobutu. 

Martha was busy disentangling 



her hair from the telephone, which 
had reached out and gotten hold 
of it with its cord. No more tele- 
phoning, 1 thought resignedly. 
Well, there was always the pay 
phone in the shopping center. 

AT ABOUT three that morning 
jfjL something woke me. The 
house was full of strange noises — 
faint squeaks and chitterings, 
swishes and rattles. Martha awoke, 
too — I think she had the same 
feeling I did that something im- 
portant was happening. We got 
up, dressed and went downstairs. 

In the front hallway all the appli- 
ances were milling around the 
door, the larger ones bumping 
repeatedly into it, trying to get 
it open. The vacuum had figured 
out the hook and eye, but couldn’t 
reach it. 

While we stood watching them 
a rumbling came from the sun- 
porch and the color TV rolled 
in on its casters and Joined the 
group. They clustered around the 
door like animals trying to escape 
a zoo. 

Martha looked at me. 1 looked 
at her. 

“I suppose if they want out that 
badly we ought to let them out,” 
she said. 

I nodded. I pushed my way 
through the crowd, undid the hook 
and opened the door. The bunch 



86 



GALAXY 



of them pushed and shoved their 
way out and down the steps. I was 
just beginning to worry about the 
neighbors when 1 saw that 1 didn’t 
have to. Lights were on up and 
down the street. People were mill- 
ing around in their underwear, 
shouting and screaming, and every- 
where I looked there were moving 
appliances, some scuttling under- 
foot like rats, their chrome 
glittering in the streetlights. 

I looked around. Harry’s light 
was on. 1 grabbed Martha’s hand 
and started over there. Halfway I 
met Harry. 

“1 tried phoning you when it 
started,” Harry said, “but the 
phone’s gone, too.” 

“Gone?” 

“Nothing left but a wire sticking 
out of the wall. It rode out on my 
mobile wet bar.” 

“Rode?” 

“Like that.” He pointed down 
the street. About a hundred feet 
away a combination TV-magazine 
rack was trundling by, its top and 
racks filled with smaller appliances. 
Farther away, at the cross streets, 
a river of small objects was moving 
resolutely west. 1 looked the other 
way. The same thing was going on 
down there. The appliances in the 
street were moving randomly to- 
ward one intersection or the other, 
but once they reached a crossing 
they turned west. 



A loud crash sounded behind us, 
followed by the crunching of 
timbers. Harry’s Austin America 
emerged from its shattered garage 
doors and moved toward the road. 
A few seconds later I heard other 
crashes. The street began to fill 
with cars. Some people tried to 
open the doors and put on brakes. 
A few succeeded. The rest of the 
cars began to move down the street, 
the smaller appliances scuttling 
to right or left to keep out of the 
way. Regretfully 1 watched our 
VW camper trundle by. I could 
have stopped it, but I had a definite 
feeling about leaving well enough 
alone. 

“We’d better get out of the 
street,” I said to Martha. “The 
cars might not see us.” 

She nodded, looking around 
speechlessly. Phyllis came up and 
took Harry’s hand. Harry and I 
looked at each other and without 
words came to the same conclusion. 
There was a big condominium on 
La Cienega, not far away. The 
four of us started over there. 

The elevators weren’t running, as 
we had- sort of expected. We 
climbed the sixteen or so flights 
to the sundeck. On the way we 
passed hordes of things going the 
other way — toasters, coffee pots, 
TV sets, refrigerators, radios, 
stereos — inching or rolling or 
crawling their way down the steps. 



FAREWELL TO THE ARTIFACTS 



87 



Larger ones with wheels were 
always covered with smaller hitch- 
hikers. They ignored us or nosed 
at us inquiringly. We stepped 
carefully around them. 

We made it to the sundeck and 
looked around. The deck was al- 
ready crowded with people. They 
looked down uncomprehendingly. 

The moonlight and streetlights 
showed a river of metal moving 
slowly and steadily toward the 
ocean. Houses stood out like 
little islands in the current. The 
roads and sidewalks and front 
lawns were solidly filled with mov- 
ing shapes. The streets were side- 
walk to sidewalk with cars, their 
lights out, moving slowly west. 
Distantly we could hear screams 
and the sound of smashing glass. 

Then, while we watched, all 
the lights in sight went out. A tre- 
mendous quiet settled over every- 
thing as thousands of vent fans 
and the air-conditioners — whatever 
ones were left — sighed to a stop. 
I suddenly had a flash of huge, 
impossibly massive generators 
heaving themselves up — to the 
panic of the operating engineers — 
and ponderously moving west to 
the accompaniment of rending 
girders and falling power lines. 
From below, the noise of things 
crawling purposefully through 
the streets — millions of them — 
came through clearly and dis- 



tantly, like the sound of an 
auditorium filling. In every 
direction, as far as we could see, 
the full moon picked up things in 
motion, all heading west. 

About five miles west was the 
Pacific Ocean. 

Martha, Harry, Phyllis and I 
sort of looked at each other. Then 
we grabbed each other by the 
shoulders in a little circle, there on 
the roof among people shouting 
and arguing with each other, and 
we smiled. It was like New Year’s 
Eve. Something was happening 
and we didn’t know what it was — 
but it looked interesting. 

ALONG about six-thirty we 
Am. walked home. The streets 
were fairly clear by then, but we 
still had to avoid an occasional 
power tool crunching along — 
like the drill press I almost barked 
my shin on — and sometimes we 
had to step out of the way of a 
dishwasher rumbling by on its 
plastic wheels. The sky was 
streaked with red and as the sun 
broke above the horizon Harry 
said, “Look there!’’ 

We looked at the sky. High over- 
head were what looked like thou- 
sands of tiny birds — commercial 
airliners, empty of passengers 
I hoped, flying west. Below them, 
rising in flocks above the trees, 
streaming from houses and build-

ings, were thousands and thousands 
of small, birdlike things, flapping 
madly for altitude, curved necks 
stretched eagerly toward the ocean. 

They were coathangers. Flocks 
of coathangers. 

For a while the sky was dark with 
them and the whipping sound of 
their flight was clear and shrill in 
the morning air. 

Martha and I stopped and held 
hands while the coathangers flew 
over. We suddenly realized, with 
a sort of quiet finality, that we were 
watching the last man-made ob- 
jects that we were likely to see in 
the sky for a long time. 

Here and there on the street were 



smashed appliances. A few people 
who had gotten to their cars were 
trying to start them, but with no 
luck. It dawned on me that they 
would never get them started, that 
these cars were dead really dead. 
Somehow, in some way that I 
didn’t understand — and neither 
would the engineers — the cars 
and other things that had not joined 
the migration would never work 
again. 

The four of us entered our living 
room. The house was eerily quiet- 
dead and deserted. Martha went 
into the kitchen to make some 
coffee, but the kitchen, of course, 
was empty. The coffeemaker was

David Gerrold. now in his late twenties, 
says, "I still don't know what I'm going to 
be when I grow up. I never really knew I 
wanted to be a writer — but then again, I 
never really knew I wanted to be anything 
else." 

Raised in Los Attgeles, David confesses 
to a precocious love for the motion picture 
art. "Everything," he says, "revolved around 
the movies. I wanted to see them, make 
them, act in them. I wanted to make movies 
so bad, my parents had to ask my permis- 
sion to use their own movie camera." 

David holds a B.A. Degree in Theater 
Arts. "The most important thing I learned 
is that unless you have a story, you might as 
well not even put film in the camera. Every- 
thing starts with the story." His first break 
came in 1966 when Gene Coon, then pro- 
ducer of STAR TREK, was impressed with 
one of David's outlines. Coon asked him to 



submit others, one of which eventually be- 
came "The Trouble With Tribbles" — ranking 
among the show's most popular episodes. 
The script was David's first sale as a 
scieiKe-fiction writer — and it later garnered 
a Hugo nomination. Since then, he has sold 
numerous short stories to GALAXY and IF, 
plus several novels and anthologies to 
Ballantine, Random House and other lead- 
ing publishing houses. 

"I don't consider myself specifically a 
science-fiction writer," David sums up. 
"But whan you have all time and all space 
to mass around in, the temptation to do so 
is irresistible. I write to express my feelings, 
and writing helps me understand what I'm 
feeling and why. My Harlie stories are good 
examples. If the reader is errtertainad, then 
they are good stories — but if he feels some- 
thing of what I felt in the writing, then I'm 
a good writer."

ator, the blender, the toaster and 
the can opener. A broken wire 
sticking out of a discolored spot 
on the wall was all that was left 
of the telephone. I knew it was the 
same way in the rest of the house, 
probably in the rest of the world — 
although it would take us a damn 
long time to find out. 

Martha came back with a can of 
coffee and a kettle. “How about 
building us a fire?” she asked. 

I got some wood from the box 
and Harry laid some kindling and 
in a few minutes we had a cheery 
little blaze in the fireplace. Martha 
rigged up a pothook out of dead 
old wire magazine rack and in a 
few minutes we had coffee — bitter 
and too strong, maybe, but coffee. 
On a hunch I went to the sun- 
porch and sure enough — behind 
the couch was the old guitar I 
used to play. 1 brought it in, re- 
flecting that all the electric instru- 
ments had probably gone with 
everything else. I sat down on the 
floor and, in an experimental 
mood, strummed a chord and hum- 
med a few notes. The guitar 
sounded fine. Phyllis hummed 
along for a few seconds. 

“Well,” Harry said, looking 
around, “here we are.” 

“Here we are,” I agreed. 

“I wonder what it’s going to be 
like now?” Phyllis said. 



“1 don’t know,” I said, “But it 
sure as hell is going to be 
interesting.” 

Harry started to laugh. 

“What’s so funny?” Martha 
asked. 

“I was thinking that in a 
few minutes it’ll be time to go 
to work.” He chuckled. “Tele- 
phoning orders, using the adding 
machine, making Xeroxes, pro- 
graming the computer.” 

“Why not take the day off?” 
Martha asked. 

We all laughed. Then, as it hit 
us, we laughed harder until our 
sides hurt. When the merriment 
died down and we were merely 
chuckling occasionally, Phyllis 
said, “We can make a great break- 
fast over that fire.” 

“Let’s do it,” Martha said. 

They went to rummage through 
the pile of food that the refrigerator 
had left in the middle of the kitchen 
floor. Harry squatted down in front 
of the fire and warmed his hands. 
His face looked unusually 
peaceful. 

“What’s on your mind?” I 
asked him. 

He grinned. “Growing food.” 

I picked up the guitar again and 
strummed at it. I reflected that 
I needed quite a bit of practice be- 
fore I’d be any good. 

But I didn’t have to hurry. I 
had all the time in the world. ★

W ILL you bear with me 
through two reminiscences? 
In the late ’forties my roommate 
(and finest friend) was L. Jerome 
Stanton, who for a while was John 
Campbell’s assistant on Astound- 
ing. A man of wide tolerance and 
forbearance, he had one crotchet: 
he could not abide wild and hyster- 
ical enthusiasms. People who oh- 



boyed and gee-whizzed up the walls 
and across the ceiling were, to him, 
exterminate. Imagine my surprise 
one night to hear from his room a 
ululating war-whoop and the 
pounding of feet — he exploded into 
the living room waving a manu- 
script and crying, “Read this 
read this.” When I could, I did. The 
story was from the slush pile — 



91 



irreverent editors’ cant for unsolic- 
ited manuscripts — and was the 
work of an unknown called T. L. 
Sherred, and the title was E for 
Effort. If you’ve read it you know 
its pace and power and clean, clean 
style — if you haven’t I envy you 
that first experience. Here’s a man 
who has something very important 
to say and says it well and truly. 
But the manuscript had one quality 
which you won’t see. It may have 
been a peculiarity of the typewriter 
Sherred was using, or the way he 
used it, but every word was speed- 
blurred, carrying a faint comet- 
tail blur to the left. Nothing 
could have been more appropriate 
to the story, and it’s a shame it 
wasn’t photo-repro’d for the 
magazine instead of having been 
type-set. With awe in his voice the 
phlegmatic Stanton said “It’s 
paced like a drunk falling down- 
stairs.’’ Well — it is indeed and 
you’ll find it in First Person, 
Peculiar, subtitled How first can a 
peculiar person geft — along with 
three other novelettes: Cure 

Guaranteed, Eye for Iniquity and 
Cue for Quiet. There are similar- 
ities among these, but let that pass. 
Sherred is like a superb marksman 
with a superb weapon. It’s his 
targets that differ widely — and he 
does not miss. 

One further note on Sherred: in 
the “Afterword’’ for his story in 



Ellison’s huge Again Dangerous 
Visions, Sherred says flatly that he 
will write no more. If ever there 
were cause for a letter campaign, 
this is it. Sherred, take it back. 

Reminiscence the second: About 
1950 Groff Conklin and I gave a 
new editor a helping hand with the 
slush pile for a new magazine — H. 
L. Gold and Galaxy respectively. 
It was a Sunday night and 1 had 
read something beetween a quarter- 
million and 300,000 words since 
Friday. I was weary and gritty-eyed 
and the one thing I didn’t need was 
another story. But I picked up that 
just-one-more, you know, to glance 
at it. 

About an hour later I woke my 
wife. I had tears on my face. “Read 
this. Just read this.’’ And 1 got on 
the phone. It took the better part 
of another hour to get through to a 
tiny town near Albany and I finally 
found myself talking to a quiet, 
unresponsive and completely 
unrevealing voice, very unexcited at 
having been called at 3 ack emma. 

“Edgar Pangborn?” 

“Yes.’’ 

“Hey, I’ve just read yom Angel’s 
Egg. It’s just beautiful. It’s one of 
the most beautiful things I’ve ever 
read!” 

“Thanks.” 

And that was about it. I’ve since 
come to know Edgar Pangborn 
quite well. He is very shy and 



92 



GALAXY 



quiet and one of the sharpest and 
most sensitive observers of people, 
motives, love, loss and pain in all 
the world. As you’ll see for your- 
self in the long-awaited, much- 
needed Pangborn collection Good 
Neighbors and Other Strangers, 
which is Angel's Egg and ten other 
delightful, moving, startling, pro- 
vocative and/or gently funny 
stories. 



N OW I’ve reminisced myself 
out of justice-space and must 
be unjustly brief with these: 

The chief defect of The Terminal 
Man is The Andromeda Strain — 
and I freely concede that it’s hard 
to be more unjust to a book than to 
judge it by the merits of some other 
book. But if a man writes a block- 
busting runaway best-seller he has 
put himself in a different country. 
Anyway, in the long run the com- 
parison is fair. The Andromeda 
Strain dealt with something that 
threatened all humanity — The 
Terminal Man deals with one 
man’s disaster, and Crichton does 
not make of his tortured Harry 
Benson, an epileptic, the kind of 
man one can identify with, care 
about, fascinating as his case may 
be. Aside from this cavil, the book 
is well enough wrought. 

There are few joys greater in this 
assignment than to run into a 



really fine first by a new name. The 
name is Marie C. Farca and her 
book is called Earth — and if she 
gets any better than this she will be 
right in the superstar category. She 
has drawn a comparison between 
two Earths — either of which, in her 
far future, may be the original one 
— one of which has progressed to 
the highest technological achieve- 
ment; the other has been all but 
killed by pollution. On the latter, 
under a dome, is a village, and we 
get to spend most of the book there, 
getting to know the people. Her 
method is to illustrate extremes and 
to indicate the middle way, as the 
best of ancient Greek philosophy 
once did. These two planets have a 
great deal to learn from one 
another and in the end there’s a 
strong chance that they will. As for 
her protagonist, Ames — for all he 
is from a most remote future, he is 
indeed someone the reader can give 
a damn about. 

Barry N. Malzberg has pushed 
down again on his detonator and 
exploded us another novel. The 
Falling Astronauts. Again he is 
grinding his teeth at, and on, 
NASA, its efforts and its postures. 
This is an examination-in-depth of 
the third man on an Apollo pro- 
ject, who has to mind the store 
while the two others make their 
marks on the surfaces of Luna and 
the history books. He is obsessed by 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



93 



the notion of blasting off and leav- 
ing them there. Malzberg pulls you 
right inside the skin of this bumb- 
ling, tilted, angry astronaut and 
through him alone (for what real 
suspense do NASA procedures 
leave a viewer?) creates all the 
terror and wonder that the space 
program has robbed from us. I 
think I have finally isolated the 
uniqueness of Malzberg. There 
have been angry writers before — 
and black humorists — but their 
mark seems always to have been a 
kind of snobbishness: 1-know- 

something-you-don’t-know. Malz- 
berg gives a voice to the mixed- 
up, the impotent, to the torment 
of helplessness — and to the pecu- 
liar hope that personal integrity, 
even if it be irrational or wrong- 
headed, may just possibly be able 
to beat the system. 

AND speaking of the unique — 
xX let me again make the 
distinction between an original 
book and a unique one. Mickey 
Spillane, as a good example, 
wrote the original Mickey 
Spillane kind of book. Immedi- 
ately he and others could repeat 
the trick. 

But unique books cannot be 
redone by anyone, not even by 
a very short shelf indeed — and 
they are very, very good. Such a 



book is Josephine Saxton’s 
The Heiros Gamos of Sam and An 
Smith, which, as it happens, 1 
missed in hardcover but which can 
now be had in paperback. It’s a 
tale or a fable and an adventure or 
a parable. It’s frightening and 
tender and puzzling and provoca- 
tive — in short, it will give you back 
in full measure what you’re capable 
of bringing to it and if you don’t 
get anything out of it it’s your 
fault, not the book’s. You’ll partici- 
pate in this one or you won’t. If 
you don’t. I’m sorry — it’s your 
great lack and your loss. Ms. 
Saxton’s new one is Group Feast, 
the bare bones of which are these — 
the wealthiest woman in the world 
decides to throw a party in the most 
incredible house ever built — and 
she does and it’s a whing-ding 
you’ll never forget. 

Max Ehrlich, sparkplug-in-chief 
of Zero Population Growth, turns 
out to be a writer of great compe- 
tence. The “edict” in his book 
commands that there be no more 
births for thirty years. If there is 
one, the baby dies and so do both 
parents. The edict is cushioned 
with a social system of superficial 
liberality where sex is easy to come 
by (a great phrase, that) and even 
the pregnancy experience is accept- 
able — provided it’s terminated. The 
book (and I hate to be this brief) is 
the story of a couple who decided to 



94 



GALAXY 



go through with one. Warmly 
recommended. 

We are about to be swamped by 
cyborgs — cybernetic organisms, 

people (usually) who are partly 
machines. One new TV series with 
this theme is already on the air and 
I know of three more in prepara- 
tion. An archetype of the concept 
is Martin Caiden’s Cyborg, which 
deals with a test-pilot/astronaut of 
the stamp that bugs Malzberg so 
much, who flies an experimental 
rocket plane into the Mohave 
Desert and leaves both legs and an 
arm in the wreckage. These, and a 
number of other replacements and 
improvements, are brought to a 
new optimum and we have a 
superman superspy. Caiden is a 
science writer of enormous compe- 
tence, and the account of his 
hero’s reconstruction is absolutely 
fascinating. His subsequent adven- 
tures as a CIA superweapon are 
great if that’s your thing. His devel- 
opment as a human being is some- 
thing Caiden tries very hard to do 
well — and doesn’t — but if you’re 
gadget-happy that won’t matter. 

Tarzan Alive, subtitled A 
Definitive Biography of Lord 
Greystroke, is a labor of love by sfs 
greatest lover, Philip Jose Farmer. 
With dumfounding energy and 
high good humor he has produced 
a veritable Ph.D. thesis on the 
real Tarzan, who of course is alive 



and very busy to this day. With 
great gobbets of cross-reference 
and footnotes, addenda and 
bibliographies. Farmer traces the 
life history of the man on whom 
E. R. Burroughs patterned his 
Tarzan character. A delightful, 
colossal, stupendous book. 

Worthy collections, anthologies 
and reprints (and I weep at having 
to be this brieO: Silverberg’s antho 
Alpha Two — ten fine stories and a 
Best Buy. The General Zapped an 
Angel — nine literate and potent

Gernsback’s still good for about 
four valid story ideas per page. 
This is not, by the way, a reprint — 
it’s a posthumous first edition. A 
curiosity and a treasure. ★

April, Year One 

J ACKSON CANUTE, on that 
terrible morning, faced three 
things he did not want to face. 

One, his baby-food business 
would have practically no cus- 
tomers in less than two years. 

Two, the probabilities were that 



he was not one of the naturally 
resistant. According to the latest 
information only one in 20,000 
persons had not been rendered 
permanently sterile. 

Three, like almost every adult 
he was experiencing the end-of- 
the-world syndrome, as it was to 
be called.

. And what were you 
doing on the day when 



the population imploded? 



Number three he thought he 
could handle. He had always 
prided himself on his self-control, 
his flexibility, his adaptability. 

Number two? He would not 
know whether or not he was sterile 
until he took the test Clabb had 
described in his letters. 

Number one? Conversion. 



But his wife, Ellen, was phoning 
him and he knew by her whiteness, 
her drawn face, her wide eyes, that 
she was going to be hysterical 
about all three and nasty about 
number two. 

His secretary, Jessica, had asked 
him if she should put the call 
through and he had said she should. 



97 



Get It Over With was his 
philosophy. 

He pressed the button and 
Ellen asked, “Why did you take so 
long about answering?” 

“You’re not the only one 
shaken up,” he said. “1 heard the 
news on the radio just before I 
drove into the parking lot.” 

“It’s awful, isn’t it?” she said. 
“Just terrible! Horrible!” 

“If it’s true,” Jackson said. 

“It certainly is true!” Her voice 
rose, fluttering like a frightened 
bird. “They verified all the im- 
portant things before they released 
the news. How do you explain the 
sudden drop in pregnancies in the 
last four months? It was all 
Clabb’s* doing! He explained the 
whole thing in his letter — the one 
they read. How he built toy fac- 
tories all over the world, except 
in the Iron Curtain countries, and 
how only he knew that the aerosol 
he’d had his scientists make was 
being blown out into the winds 
and carried all over the world and 
how it affected only man and the

longer any reason to suppress the news. 
Clabb had disappeared without a trace. One 
theory was that Clabb may have become

July Choke in New York City in 1976.

person in twenty thousand — ” 
“Clabb’s letter was read over 
the radio and I heard it again on the 
TV in my office.” 

“They say Clabb has disap- 
peared. No one has the slightest 
idea of where he went.” 
“Naturally,” Jackson said. 
“Please come home,” Ellen 
said. “I’m just about to go to 
pieces.” 

“I was planning on coming home 
— was just going to call you,” he 
said. It was evident that she meant 
to wait until he got home before 
she reproached him. “But first 1 
have to make some calls. It takes 
time and money to convert a busi- 
ness and — ” 

“What do you mean?” 

He explained and she said, 
“What if you can’t get a loan to 
change over? Nobody’s going to 
want to invest in the future because 
the future isn’t going to exist. It — ” 
“You’re getting hysterical.” 

He regretted saying that as soon 
as he had said it. In Ellen’s mind 
to be accused was to be guilty. She 
broke up and was still screaming, 
when he cut her off. He checked 
Dr. Seward’s office number but 
received no answer. He tried the 
doctor’s home. Mrs. Seward an- 
swered. Her makeup was wrecked 
by tears and her slurred speech 
indicated she had been drinking.

“Ronald’s at General Hospital,” 
she said. “He’s got six would-be 
suicides on his hands and more 
coming in. And I’m not so sure that 
I’m not going to be one of his 
patients if he doesn’t come 
home.” 

“Call a good doctor,” Jackson 
said, hoping the dry approach 
would calm her down. And then, 
seeing her anger, he said, “I’m just 
kidding, Jane. Look, why don’t 
you go over to my house? You and 
Ellen can buck up each other until 
I get home. Or maybe that’s not 
such a good idea. Ellen’s no post 
to lean on just now. Go to Willa’s. 
She’s pretty steady.” 

“She’s one of Ronald’s pill- 
takers!” Jane Seward said shrilly. 
“Good God, man, don’t you know 
this is the end of the road for 
humanity?” 

“I don’t know aiiy such thing,” 
Jackson said. “Look, go over and 
talk to Ellen until 1 get home. 
Meanwhile, consider the figures. 
Even with only one — ” 

He stopped. She had cut him 
off. He pressed Jessica’s button. 
“Call my wife. Tell her I’m on my 
way home now. I will actually be 
making some phone calls, but 
they shouldn’t take too long. By 
the way, you look as if you were 
being sensible about this.” 

“I’m too numb really to know 
what’s going on inside me,” she 



said. She smiled. She was beautiful 
enough when her face was com- 
posed — when she smiled she was 
striking. 

Her face faded from the screen. 
He spoke Arnold Rawley’s 
number, but according to his 
secretary Mr. Rawley was not in. 
She did not know where he was. 
He was not at home, because she 
had called there and his wife had 
said that he should have been at 
work. 

C ANUTE phoned Mike’s, a 
tavern on High view Road 
near Highview Woods, where 
Canute and Rawley lived. Mike’s 
was a small but elegant place. It 
had become a sort of “neighbor- 
hood” tavern. The neighbors 
were some of the wealthiest and 
most influential men in Busiris. 

Mike answered. In a few sec- 
onds Rawley’s flushed face was on 
the screen. 

“Jackson!” Arnold said. “Come 
on down! We’re celebrating the 
end of the world! No more babies! 
Jesus!” The tears ran down his 
cheeks. 

“You have six children,” 
Canute said. “You’ve got it made.” 
“Yeah, but I won’t have any 
grandchildren. They ought to hang 
Clabb when they find him! No, 
hanging’s too good for him — they 
ought to crucify him, except that 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



99 



would be blasphemous. They 
ought to nail — ” 

“Cut it out,” Canute said. “Why 
the hell are you crying in your 
beer — scotch — anyway at this 
time of the morning? You don’t 
even know that everything Clabb 
says is true. With six kids you’ve 
got a chance of one’s being 
fertile even if all the claims in 
those letters are verified. 1 have 
work to do and 1 need you. I want 
to get started at once to convert — 
that much I’m sure of. I’m calling 
an emergency meeting of the 
board of directors and you should 
be working out the legal founda- 
tions. But you won’t be in any 
shape today, 1 can see. What about 
your partner? Js he off on a 
bender, too?” 

“Young Luckenvor? Not that 
cold fish.” 

“I’ll call him then,” Canute 
said. “I expect to see you sober 
tomorrow. At eight.” 

Rawley glared. 

“Young Luckenvor’s not the only 
cold fish.” 

“I can get hysterical with the 
best of you,” Canute said, “when 
there’s occasion for it. It’s not as 
if the sky was falling down. 
Chicken Licken.” 

He phoned Rawley’s office 
again. Mrs. Tengrow, the secre- 
tary, said that Luckenvor was in 
the hospital, according to a call 



she had just received from Mrs. 
Luckenvor. He had driven into a 
lamppost, wrecked the car, broken 
a collarbone and then suffered a 
broken arm when another car 
broadsided into his. The other 
driver had been arrested for 
drunkenness. Luckenvor had not 
yet been arrested, though he, too, 
had been intoxicated — and where 
was Mr. Rawley? 

“Why would Luckenvor be 
drunk so early in the morning?” 
Canute asked. “Mrs. Tengrow, 
when was the news about Clabb’s 
letter first released?” 

Mrs. Tengrow was sixty, child- 
less, and did not care much for 
the direction in which the world 
had been going for the last forty 
years. 

“Oh, the first announcement 
was during the late late show.” 
“Many people must have heard 
about it before dawn,” he said. 
“But I never thought Luckenvor 
— ” He cut himself short, told 
Tengrow where she could locate 
Rawley. “But I advise you not to 
ask him to come to the office. He 
should go home. In a taxi.” 

Mrs. Tengrow pursed her 
mouth but said nothing. 

Canute made several calls to 
board members, asking them to 
call others for a meeting at the 
Golden Boar’s Head at the earliest 
possible moment. His secretary 



100 



GALAXY 



would arrange for the private 
banquet room and take care of 
other details. 

He listened to Jessica on his 
callbox. She was still talking to 
Ellen. He turned and went out the 
back way, though Jessica had 
probably rotated the phone so that 
Ellen could not see him if he 
passed Jessica’s desk. 

H e was glad to see the tall 
white pillars and reddish- 
brown roof of his house ahead. 
Something was uncoiling from 
the ice-shot mud in his entrails. It 
was sending vibrations up through 
his flesh. 

Humanquake, he thought. I 
wonder what degree this is on the 
personal Richter scale . 

If he could cast his reactions 
into such channels he was safe from 
breakup. 

He stopped the car on the 
curving drive, turned off the steam 
and sat for what seemed a long 
while behind the wheel. Finally 
the big carved-oak door opened 
and Ellen came out. He left the 
car and walked toward her. She 
flew to him as if she were a self- 
thrown basketball, his arms the 
hoop. He held her for a long while, 
but, seeing passersby in cars 
turning their heads to look, he 
finally released her and urged her 
into the house. There he did what 



seemed to him the best way to 
comfort her— and himself— even 
though she weakly protested. But 
she lost her reluctance after a few 
minutes. She soon understood 
that they were making the most 
significant gesture they could —they 
were, in a sense, shaking their 
fists or thumbing their noses at the 
catastrophe that hung over man- 
kind. And there was the hope that 
this would result in conception and 
prove that they were not going to 
share in the larger fate of the 
world. 



C ANUTE did not get much 
accomplished the next day. 
Rawley could not make it to work. 
Even if he had not been so hung 
oyer he would have stayed home to 
settle down his wife. The board of 
directors membership was still 
suffering from shock and refused 
to attend a meeting until the 
numbness wore off. 

The third day Jackson took his 
time leaving the breakfast table. 
Ellen was fairly calm, though at 
times her chin would start trembl- 
ing and tears would appear. They 
watched the early morning news 
together. International, national 
and local news came in that order. 
Three elephants of bad portent, 
two holding the tails of their 
predecessors in their trunks. Most

programs had been canceled 
for news or special programs. These 
consisted largely of “authorities” 
lecturing or being interviewed 
or talking with other authorities. 
There were also views of reac- 
tions, public and private, from all 
over the world. 

Shortly before he left for the 
office Jackson said, “Busiris has 
a population of about two hundred 
thousand. That means that only 
about ten adults in Busiris are 
naturally resistant. Ten! And if 
half are women, how many can 
bear children? A person can be 
naturally resistant, but that doesn’t 
necessarily mean he or she is 
fertile.” 

The President of the United 
States was to speak at 8:00 p.m. One 
commentator thought that Lister 
was sure to make the same an- 
nouncement as the premier of 
China and the president of France. 
They had stated that the FCP, the 
Fertility Check Project, was 
mandatory for every citizen be- 
tween sbtteen and fifty. The test 
itself was a contribution by Clabb, 
described in one of his letters. A 
needle dipped in clabbonite — 
Clabb’s own name for it — was 
drawn across the skin of the arm 
or hand deep enough to bring 
blood. Ten minutes later, if the 
person were naturally resistant to 
Clabb’s aerosol, a red inflamma- 



tion approximately a centimeter 
wide would appear on each side of 
the scratch. Enormous batches of 
the clabbonite were being prepared 
by every nation. Public servants 
were being trained in administering 
the test. 

Some commentators thought 
that the legality of the FCP in the 
United States would be chal- 
lenged. Most suits would be of 
the civil rights variety — Jehovah’s 
Witnesses, for example, could ob- 
ject to the drawing of their blood. 

Canute kissed Ellen and drove 
to his office. She still had not 
reproached him for his having 
insisted on putting off having 
children until he was thirty and she 
was twenty-six. She was more 
restrained than he had thought she 
could be. Perhaps she was waiting 
until the results of the FCP tests 
were known. 

Jessica was waiting at the office 
with a list of what she had ac- 
complished the day before. Rawley 
would be in at 10:30, ready to dis- 
cuss the legal actions needed for 
conversion. The board of directors 
and a few major stockholders 
would be at the Golden Boar’s 
Head for lunch at 12:00. The 
meeting would start at 1:00. Mr. 
Joshua Tabbs of the First United 
Federal Savings and Trust was 
ready to meet him at 10:00 the 
next morning if Canute had the 



102

go-ahead on the conversion from 
the board. 

“How did he sound?” Jackson 
asked. 

“Upset.” 

“I was hoping he’d sound 
friendly — as he does when he’s 
favorable to a loan. But that’s too 
much to expect. Everybody’s up- 
set. They’re either too jittery or 
too controlled.” 

Jessica looked up from her 
note pad. Her eyes were naturally 
large and makeup made them 
enormous. They were a lovely 
violet under the contact lenses she 
always wore in his presence. He 
suspected that their real color was 
blue. No doubt a lovely blue. 

“Mr. Canute, what do you think 
about this FCP? Do you think 
everybody will have to take the 
test?” 

“1 see no other way out,” he said. 
“The world — humanity, rather — 
can’t afford to let a single fertile 
person go — unused.” 

“But what about unmarried 
persons?” 

“Jessica, the normal social 
sanctions don’t apply. When sur- 
vival is threatened conventions go 
out the window.” 

She glanced down at her full 
breasts, then looked up at him. 

“But what if, say, someone like 
me were — uh fertile and the man 
1 loved wasn’t?” 



“No trouble,” Jackson said, 
looking at his wristwatch. “Arti- 
ficial insemination is available.” 
“But what if my husband didn’t 
want to bring up another man’s 
child?” 

“You’ve got no idea how much 
social pressure is going to be 
brought to bear on people like 
that,” Canute said. “Listen, 
Jessica, today’s a very important 
one for Canute Baby Foods, In- 
corporated. Screen my calls even 
more thoroughly than usual. Use 
your judgment.” 

“How soon do you think the 
FCP will get going?” 

“What? Oh, 1 don’t know. 
Several months maybe. If Congress 
makes it a law. I’ll be in my office. 
Send Rawley in as soon as he 
shows.” 

T he morning went smoothly. 

Rawley, red-faced, red-eyed, 
moved sluggishly, but his brain was 
functioning. Once he understood 
that Jackson did not want to talk 
about Clabb or the FCP, he stuck 
to business. But when he was 
leaving he said, “What the hell 
will my wife and 1 do if none of our 
six kids are fertile?” 

“The oldest are seventeen and 
sixteen, right?” Jackson said. 
“They’re old enough to take the 
test now, so you will soon know the 
score. The others are twelve, eleven. 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



103 



nine, and seven, right? So you have 
to wait until they pass puberty and 
then find out. Meanwhile 1 sugge.st 
you think about their reactions, 
not yours.” 

“1 am, I am,” Rawley said. 
“Their reactions, as you call them, 
are mine. When they cry 1 cry.” 
“And when you — ” 

Jackson stopped. 

To suggest that Rawley quit 
dissolving his backbone in booze 
and give his children a good ex- 
ample would only anger him. 
“What?” Rawley said. 

“Nothing. Good luck to your 
kids. Good luck to all kids.” 

The probabilities were against 
it, but one of Rawley’s children 
might be fertile, one of Busiris’ 
lucky ten. If they were lucky. Be- 
ing fertile was going to bring on 
them an enormous amount of 
public scrutiny and concern. And 
disappointed psychotics would be a 
danger to them. The lucky might 
have to become semiprisoners, 
guarded by the state for their own 
good. 

The luncheon and board meeting 
were attended by several wealthy 
older women who owned large 
blocks of stock. They were not 
concerned about their own ste- 
rility or fertility — they were past 
the age even to be tested under the 
FCP. But they had children who 
were worried. Jackson answered 



all questions calmly and with an 
optimism he did not believe was 
founded in reality. But his object 
was to get them in a frame of 
mind for a rational consideration 
of the financial difficulties that 
Canute Baby Foods, Inc., faced. A 
few could not grasp the idea that 
baby foods would be out of custom- 
ers in two years or less. 

“But that means that my son’s 
infant disposables will be gone, 
too,” Mrs. Wilmort said. 

“Many businesses will become 
obsolete,” Canute said. “It’s easy 
to think of the obvious ones. But 
many more will be affected as 
time goes on. One trend will be 
constant and we would all do well 
to keep it in mind. From now on all 
businesses will have an ever- 
decreasing number of customers. 
The expanding economy, along 
with the expansion of population, 
is a thing of the past.” 

“The stock market is still de- 
clining,” Mrs. Dammfrum said. 

“It’ll stabilize and start up 
again,” Jackson said, not really 
believing it would. The mental 
depression of the world always 
generated a financial depression. 

“That goddamned Clabb!” 
Mrs. Mondries said. Jackson 
smiled. She was a self-righteous, 
stickily prudish person. He would 
have thought nothing could bring 
such an outburst from her. Which 



104 



GALAXY 



showed how much he knew. 

The meeting following the 
luncheon was perfunctory and 
lasted only minutes. Jackson got 
his clearance to convert and buzzed 
Jessica to move his meeting with 
Tabb ahead to that afternoon. No 
one had much heart for business. 

Reverend Cottons, a prominent 
stockholder and a nondenomina- 
tional preacher, gave the parting 
blessing. He prayed that God 
would have pity on His children and 
cancel Clabb’s evil deeds, stick 
His finger in, as it were, and resur- 
rect the dead wrigglers and eggs. 
The reverend was a tall handsome 
man of fifty-six who could project 
considerable charisma or a rea- 
sonable facsimile thereof. Along 
with this went a virility that both 
males and females of his church 
seemed to relish. Horniness and 
divinity, Canute thought, had al- 
ways been allied deep in the lay- 
man’s mind — somewhere in the 
nether layers of human aware- 
ness the desire to worship the god- 
dess of fertility lurked eternally. 

Even Canute, who belonged to 
no faith, felt more optimistic after 
Cottons had finished his prayer. 
It was all but impossible to be- 
lieve in sterility in the reverend’s 
juicy presence. 

AT three in the afternoon Canute 
was in Tabbs’ office. The 



banker was a lean, bald-headed 
man with small eyes, the greenish 
color of which suggested new 
dollar bills. He was all smiles and 
little jokes, but he was also unwill- 
ing to make a decision. 

“I can’t take an objective look 
at what your conversion involves 
until this panic is over,” Tabbs 
said. “You understand, don’t 
you?” 

“Of course,” Canute said. “But 
1 don’t have much time to start 
moving.” 

“I realize that. But you haven’t 
stated exactly what you intend to 
convert to. And the canned food 
business is highly competitive, 
isn’t that so?” 

“It is. I can give you the figures 
for the whole canning industry next 
time we meet. At this time, as 1 
said over the phone, I just want to 
get an idea of your interest in 
making me a loan.” 

“Before you go to somebody 
else? Believe me, Jackson, our rela- 
tionship has been such that I have 
great — the greatest —confidence, 

in you. You’re only twenty-eight 
but your success in running your 
father’s business has been remark- 
able. Under almost any other cir- 
cumstances I wouldn’t hesitate to 
say that we would advance what- 
ever you required. But under other 
circumstances you wouldn’t be 
wanting to convert, would you? 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



105 



The bank, too, has to face changed 
conditions.” 

Bankers dealt in hard facts and 
figures, but they were the most 
plastic of people. Or the most 
ectoplasmic. 

“I can understand why you 
want to wait,” Canute said. “Only 
I can’t afford to wait.” 

“1 appreciate that,” Tabbs said. 
“Look, it’ll take you some time to 
decide exactly what you want to do, 
how much the operation will cost, 
what losses you’ll suffer during the 
shutdown and changeover and so 
forth. By the time you’ve got your 
facts in hand we may be in a better 
position to understand what’s going 
on. In other words, the dust will 
have settled and we can see how 
near the mountains are.” 

Canute rose at the same time as 
Tabbs. Tabbs looked a little an- 
noyed that Canute had anticipated 
him. 

They shook hands and Tabbs 
said, “I am very sorry. But — ” 
“The bank comes first, of 
course,” Canute said and won- 
dered why Tabbs felt it necessary 
to apologize. 

“My daughter became pregnant 
about four months ago,” Tabbs 
said. “So she escaped this tragic 
thing. You might say our family 
made a deposit just in time. What 
interest she’ll bear — ” 

Canute smiled but did not laugh 



because he was not sure that Tabbs 
wasn’t being serious. 

“Congratulations,” he said. 
“You’ll be a grandparent at least 
once. And perhaps your daughter 
may be one of the lucky ones.” 
“Better than having gold in the 
bank,” Tabbs said. He ushered 
Canute out as if he were concen- 
trating on the treasure in the dark 
vault of his daughter’s womb. 

O UT on the street Canute felt 
deflated. He had known the 
market was bad, but he had not, 
somehow, expected to be turned 
down. But he wasn’t angry at 
Tabbs. Tabbs had to face a dif- 
ferent future along with everyone 
else. 

The First United Federal was at 
the end of the short leg of a large 
suburban shopping center in the 
form of an L. Canute decided to 
take a stroll around it. He could 
observe the state of business and 
also do some thinking about the 
conversion. The sidewalks and 
stores seemed as crowded as ever 
and nothing in the faces or move- 
ments of the shoppers indicated 
that a catastrophe had occurred. 
Many still did not understand — 
emotionally anyway — the depths 
of the event. And the disaster was 
not one that had occurred quickly 
— like a tidal wave or a volcanic 
eruption — and would be soon over.

This was an invisible calamity. Its 
effects would assume reality 
slowly — so slowly that most people 
would not begin to see the overall 
results plainly for five years. Even 
then the visible effects would not be 
overwhelming or too frightening. 
With 60,000,000 people dying 
each year, five years would see 

300.000. 000 dead all over the 
world. The deceased would leave a 
sizable gap behind them. Put to- 
gether, they would fill a mon- 
strously large and terrifying 
cemetery. But they would not be 
collected — they would be scat- 
tered everywhere. The Earth would 
absorb them quietly and, at the 
local level, the survivors would 
not notice much difference. Cities 
and towns would not be quite as 
crowded. Empty apartments and 
houses would be more numerous 
but not depressingly so. Births had 
recently ' averaged more than 

125.000. 000 yearly. Subtract the 
annual deaths of 60,000,000, and 
the world had yearly gained 

65.000. 000 persons. In effect. Earth 
had annually taken on the addi- 
tional burden of a new nation — 
another France or Germany, say. 
That gain had been suddenly cut 
off. Some years would have to pass 
before the full scope of the loss 
became visible to citizens other 
than statisticians. 

Canute walked down the short 



leg and the long leader of the L 
to the liquor store. It was crowded 
— the clerks were moving jerkily, 
trying to serve all customers at 
once. All the liquor stores, accord- 
ing to a comment by a TV news- 
man, were breaking sales records. 
Some of the customers looked as 
if they had drunk up everything 
at home and had been forced to go 
out for more, whether or not they 
could now see or walk straight. 

E WALKED back to the 
parking lot. The date was 
April 15. The sky was blue and 
cloudless. It had rained three days 
before — the grass was green and 
the trees were budding. It was a 
fine day to be alive. Yet, as T.S. 
Eliot had written, “April is the 
cruelest month.” Mankind was 
facing its end. Or was it? Clabb’s 
letter had made it plain that he 
thought he was giving humanity 
its only chance to survive. Perhaps 
he was right. Even so, this was 
still the cruelest month of Canute’s 
life. 

He drove back to his office. 
Kalender, the business agent of 
the canning workers’ union, was 
waiting for him. 

Canute shook his hand and said, 
“I was wondering how long it 
would take you to realize the im- 
plications.” 

Kalender did not ask, Implica- 




SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



107 



tions of what? He said, “You’re 
giving me credit for more intel- 
ligence than I have. I should have 
seen it, but I didn’t. Shock, I sup- 
pose. I hope it was shock, not stu- 
pidity. But 1 saw Millman’s show 
last night and he said that in five 
years kindergartens the world 
over would be empty. And in six, 
all first grades. 1 sat up and yelled 
at Richie — she’s my wife, you met 
her at — ’’ 

“I know,’’ Canute said. “A 
lovely woman. Well, come on in. 
I would have called you by tomor- 
row anyway.’’ 

Kalender’s suit came from the 
same tailor as Canute’s — his tie, 
however, was a trifle more flam- 
boyant. He had long ago gotten 
over his original, somewhat bellig- 
erent manner toward Canute. He 
listened without interruption while 
Canute told him what he had done 
so far and what he hoped to do. 

“We still have to walk out on 
July first if the industry doesn’t 
give in.’’ Kalender said. 

“You really think they’ll vote for 
a strike with the economy in such 
questionable shape and with the 
future so debatable?’’ 

“You forget they passed up a pay 
increase last year because of 
Lister’s anti-inflation speech. 1 was 
surprised when they voted against a 
strike. But this year they’re hurting 
even more. Prices — well, you know. 



The thing is, even if they don’t want 
to strike on account of they’d like 
to help you make the conversion, 
they have to. This is national, and 
the canning workers not in baby 
foods won’t be affected by your 
special situation. We’ll have to go 
along with national headquarters.” 
“Maybe you could get a dispen- 
sation from them,” Canute said. 

Kalender smiled slightly. “1 
don’t think I’ll get anywhere, 
though I’ll try. The central office 
always takes the view that the 
minority must suffer if the majority 
will profit. And — ” 

Canute said, “In ten years 
Busiris’ two hundred thousand 
population will be down to about 
a hundred and eighty-two thou- 
sand. Sales of canned foods — of 
everything, in fact — will be drop- 
ping. Now, Busiris’ decrease in 
population doesn’t sound like 
much. And Canute Foods, after 
conversion, will do the bulk of its 
business outside Busiris. But the 
overall decline in the number of 
consumers will inevitably force the 
closing of much of the canning 
industry in fifteen years. The effects 
will be felt long before then. Here 
and there factories will close down 
— never to reopen.” 

Kalender leaned forward and 
said, “You trying to scare me?” 
“Think about it and you’ll scare 
yourself.”

C ANUTE drummed his fingers 
on his desktop and then said, 
“According to our present contract, 
the company has to pay a full 
weekly wage to each worker laid 
off during any shutdown for main- 
tenance, repair, conversion, etc. 
But not during a strike. So — ” 

“I thought you’d bring that up.” 
Kalender paused to light a cigar. 
“If you wait until the strike to start 
converting, you won’t have to pay 
your workers during the shutdown. 
The national office is aware of this 
— 1 talked to the headquarters for 
an hour last night about it. Phoned 
them a half-hour after I realized 
what was going to happen. They 
said — all this is confidential, off 
the record, you know — that the new 
contract will take care of that. The 
company will have to reimburse 
its workers a hundred percent of 
the pay lost during a shutdown, 
strike or no strike. The reimburse- 
ment can be stretched out over six 
months, doesn’t have to be paid at 
once. We know that the industry 
has its problems and we’ll go along 
—to a certain extent.” 

Jackson Canute leaned back, put 
his hands behind his head and 
looked up at the pale blue ceiling 
with its glowing traceries: man- 
dalas, crux ansatas, cosmic eyes, 
dollar signs, pyramids, infinity 
signs, ying and yang. 

“I object in principle. But in 



practice I can’t see that it makes 
much difference. If you don’t strike 
we have to pay you during shut- 
down. However, 1 don’t know what 
view the banks will take of the 
strike and the shutdown pay. They 
might decide that they can’t make 
the loan. Banks take the long-range 
view, you know, and they won’t 
have any trouble extrapolating the 
effects of decpop, as the newsmen 
are calling it. The canned food 
industry is highly competitive. You 
know that as well as I. And our 
establishing a foothold is going to 
take time, will cost us much and 
possibly — I might even say most 
likely — will result in failure. 

“And even if we — notice the we, 
since you workers are as much a 
part of Canute Canned Foods as 
the managers and stockholders— 
even if we do get a good share of 
the business, enough to keep us 
going, we won’t be able to keep up 
the gross indefinitely. Sales, as I 
said, will inevitably decline for the 
entire industry. And then the dog- 
eat-dog struggle ends in one dog, 
top dog. And within forty years — 
with two billion four hundred mil- 
lion of those now living dead and 
with very little replacement — the 
world population will be about one 
billion six hundred million. Still 
sounds like a lot, doesn’t it? Well, 
it’s eight million less than it was in 
nineteen hundred. 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP

“Seventy years from now there 
will still be several million centen- 
arians, nonagenarians and so on. 
And several hundred thousand 
young fertile people. Maybe. If 
society doesn’t crumble long before 
then, which it may well do. As you 
know, modern society, capitalist, 
communist, or socialist, depends 
on an expanding economy. 
Which—’’ 

“1 know,’’ Kalender said. “And 
the banks know. But even so, if 
the banks quit making loans be- 
cause of this they will go out of 
business. Won’t they hang on to a 
business-as-usual policy as long as 
possible?” 

“1 hope so.” 

Canute talked some more about 
what could be done. But in the end 
the two returned from the abstract 
and the unlikely to the coming next 
six months. Finally Kalender de- 
cided to leave. 

“Usually these preliminary talks 
straighten both of us out on the 
realities and the potentials,” he 
said. “No matter what our public 
statements, we both knew pretty 
well what we will end up doing. But 
this time — who knows? It’s up to 
the banks — ” 

“They’re just part of the total 
picture,” Canute said. “They’re 
depending on many things to help 
them make up their minds. One of 
which, a very important which, is 



the President of the United States. 
Maybe he’ll say something signifi- 
cant in tonight’s speech.” 

Kalender left. Canute felt de- 
pressed. Even reminding himself 
that depression was anger turned 
inward did not help. What was he 
angry at? The union? Because of 
its short-sightedness? Its members 
were acting according to the old 
rules — and if they didn’t see that 
new rules had to be adopted they 
were no more blind than the man- 
agers and the bankers. Perhaps the 
President, who was a flexible and 
unconventional man — too much 
so for many voters — would come 
up with new rules. But even, if he 
did — could he get his nation to ac- 
cept them? 

C ANUTE had invited to dinner 
the Rawleys; his vice presi- 
dent, Markham and wife; Mrs. 
Luckenvor (who came after visiting 
her husband in the hospital); Jack 
Ward, a construction company 
owner and a powerful politician; 
the city manager and his wife and 
Manfred Schiller, a black econ- 
omics professor at Traybell Univ- 
ersity. 

The dinner went only so-so — talk 
was punctuated by frequent total 
silences despite the tested ability of 
everyone present to keep a conver- 
sation going. Afterward the party 



110 



GALAXY 



moved into the big TV room to 
view Lister’s speech. 

The President was a lean-faced 
man of fifty-three. His voice had a 
compelling resonance — it made 
most voters want to believe him. 
Normally he managed to look both 
grave and cheerful at the same 
time, but tonight a bleakness 
seemed to override his spirit. Or 
perhaps, Canute thought, his view- 
ers had turned off their cheerfulness 
receptors. 

Canute was disappointed that the 
President did not propose some 
bold new economic measures. 
However, he had no right to expect 
them. As he had told himself 
earlier, it was too early for these. 
The major part of the speech con- 
cerned the setting up of fertility 
tests for the entire nation, exclusive 
of the too old and the too young, of 
course. The first tests would be 
given on June 28 and the FCP 
Department, newly created, would 
handle the project. Professional 
medical personnel was not needed 
to make the tests or even interpret 
their results. Within four months 
the nation should know what its 
“fertility resources” were. Scien- 
tists’ projections placed these at 
approximately 13,250 persons. 
The aged were excluded. Young- 
sters whose natural resistance to 
the aerosol could be determined but 
whose actual fertility would not be 



known until they matured sexually 
were included in the statistical 
projection. 

Lister emphasized several times 
that the fertiles would be given 
special treatment from now on. 
He did not say what the special 
treatment was to be. 

The President said that the world 
had no reason to panic. The over- 
population problem had been 
solved overnight, as it were, 
whether or not the world liked the 
nature of the solution. What had 
happened was a catastrophe, but it 
was not the end of man. Far from 
it. People were not dying any faster 
or in any greater numbers. The only 
difference that had immediate im- 
pact was that the world was not 
having to handle daily the arrival 
of enough babies to populate New 
Orleans, Louisiana, or Newark, 
New Jersey. 

Lister took a hopeful view of the 
situation. 

However — and here Lister’s 
voice trumpeted as if for a cavalry 
charge — the old methods of dealing 
with society, economics and so 
forth could no longer be used. This 
was a new and unprecedented situa- 
tion. Fresh approaches would have 
to be developed. There would be 
much resistance to some of these, 
since most people were naturally 
conservative, naturally resistant 
to swift change. But everyone 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



111 



would soon see that the old 
methods were now useless. 

The new departures would be des- 
cribed in a future speech. Mean- 
while no cause for panic or even 
pessimism existed on either individ- 
ual or national levels . 

The party at Canute’s listened 
quietly to the various commenta- 
tors on the President’s speech. Next 
came extracts of other speeches 
made by heads of other states from 
all over the world. In essence these 
made the same points Lister had 
made. 

Canute finally turned off the set. 
Everybody began to talk excitedly 
at once. Even those who were sus- 
picious of Lister’s “methods” 
were not gloomy. They seemed to 
take a joy in arguing that there was 
no sense in abandoning the present 
system for even more socialism or 
for communist-type institutions. 
It was evident that the President’s 
speech had uplifted everybody, 
even those who would fight against 
his measures to deal with the crisis. 

“What do you think about it, 
Jackson?” Rawley said. 

“Whatever the new system is, 
some men will come out on top and 
some will go down,” Canute said. 

“And you hope to be on top, 
right?” Rawley asked. 

“1 believe that I’m flexible 
enough,” Canute said. 

“Well, I hope you’re flexible 



enough to get a loan for the con- 
version. Say, maybe that’s one of ; 
the things Lister was hinting at? A 
Federal loan could keep Canute i 
Baby Foods, Incorporated, in 
business.” 

The trouble with Rawley, Canute 
thought, was that he insisted on 
thinking in the same old grooves. 

June, Year One 

J ACKSON and Ellen Canute 
had received a letter from the 
newly created Fertility Checkup 
Project Department two weeks < 

earlier. They were to report at the 
Reywoods High School for their 
tests on the morning of June 28th. 
Instructions included a procedure 
to follow if the Canutes objected ‘ 
to taking the test on religious or 
civil-rights grounds. Arrest was 

automatic, but under the Emer- 
gency Vital Resources Law the 
arrestee would be released im- 
mediately on bail. The law required 1 
that the case be tried within a week 
before a special judge and a jury of 
twelve peers. This was unheard-of 
speed for the courts, but the fertil- j 

ity resisters, as the news media j 

dubbed them, had total priority. 
The Government, which was the ! 
people, could not afford to miss 
one potential parent. The Presi- 
dent, during a press interview, had 
stated that mankind’s existence 



112 



GALAXY I 



depended upon one in every 
20,000 persons — and that one must 
be found. He pointed out that 
similar laws with much harsher 
methods of enforcement and pen- 
alties were being passed in less 
democratic nations. 

A new law had been passed by 
the time June 28th came around. 
It required resisters to be subjected 
to physical and psychiatric testing. 
The theory was that anyone who 
would not cooperate in saving man- 
kind had to be psychotic. Part of 
the test was drawing a needle across 
the skin so that blood welled. 
Most of those scratched failed to 
react with inflammation and these 
were quickly released without a 
trial. A number of suits were filed 
against the U.S. government before 
testing even began and eventually 
the U.S. Supreme Court declared 
the law unconstitutional. But by 
then everybody, objector or not, 
had been tested. 

Jackson and Ellen drove to the 
high school on the hot July morn- 
ing. A traffic jam delayed them for 
ten minutes. Then they had to 
cruise around the big parking lot 
until someone pulled out. A little 
steam-driven Volkswagen tried 
to beat them into the parking 
place. It was going in the wrong 
direction, ignoring the signs and 
arrows all over the place. 

Ellen had been sullen and with- 



drawn that morning and Jackson 
was angry about this. That was 
why, when he saw the Volkswagen 
cut around the car that had just 
left the parking place and swing 
sharply inward, he kicked down 
on the accelerator. He and Ellen 
were jerked back. Canute swung 
the wheel. Ellen gasped and put 
one hand on the dashboard and 
the other on his right arm. He 
blew the horn, but the driver of 
the little car, grinning at him from 
under a thick mustache, made no 
effort to slow down. Jackson 
swore as the Volkswagen crashed 
into his left fender. 

He and Ellen sat still for a 
moment, shaking and pale. The 
impact bag before them was 
shrinking with a long drawn-out 
gasp. 

“You all right?” Jackson asked. 
Ellen said, “I think so. I’m just 
scared, that’s all.” 

“I was doing eight and he was 
going about thirteen,” Jackson 
told her. “That’s a twenty-one- 
kilometer impact.” 

“I’m glad you’re so cool and 
quick-thinking,” Ellen said. 
“You’re so cool that now I’ll 
never have a baby!” 

“We haven’t had the test yet, 
remember?” He unfastened his 
safety belts and opened the door. 
He knew that if he stayed in the car 
he would really take off on Ellen. 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



113 



He climbed out and examined the 
damage to his car. The fender had 
crumpled, but the little car’s 
bumper, hood and radiator were 
pushed in. About a thousand dol- 
lars’ worth of damage for the other 
man— a hundred for himself. 

A guard appeared, a recorder 
hung around his neck and a micro- 
phone in his hand. The driver of 
the Volkswagen got out, but his 
woman passenger stayed inside. 
She was a pretty girl of about 
twenty and held a baby. It was 
screaming loudly. But the mother 
was safety-belted and both she 
and the baby had been protected 
by the impact bag. The driver, also 
young, wore one of the new Marie 
Antoinette wigs, green wrap- 
around glasses, dangly crystal 
earrings and fluorescent pink-and- 
green striped Louis XVI suit. He 
was pale and angry. 

“I got a baby in the car,” he 
said. 

C ANUTE was taken aback. 

But he quickly recovered. He 
asked, “So why were you driving 
the wrong way, speeding and 
endangering the infant by trying 
to beat me into the parking place, 
to which you had no right?” 

The officer stopped in front of 
them, flicked on the recorder and 
said, “I called the regulars. Mean- 
while, your ID card, please.” 



Jackson handed it to him and the 
officer stuck the card into the re- 
corder. A tiny light gleamed and 
he removed the card, handed it 
back to Jackson. He then asked 
the young man for his card. 

The young man gave it to him, 
but said, “I’ve got a baby in the 
car and this guy paid no attention 
to him — ” 

A crowd had gathered. A num- 
ber of them must have seen the , 
accident, but only one, a middle- 
aged lady named Greenbaum, 
volunteered to be a witness. 

The young man, a Mr. Dutton, 
continued to harp on the fact that 
his infant son had been a passenger. 
And that Canute had ignored the 
baby and crashed right on through. 

Jackson did not understand 
Dutton’s insistence on this com- 
pletely irrelevant point. What 
did the baby have to do with this, 
except that its presence should 
have made Dutton more careful 
with his driving? Then he heard 
comments, some subdued, some 
loud, from the bystanders and 
understood what Dutton was 
getting at. The young man was ' 

entirely in the wrong, but he knew i 

that things had changed — that 
babies were now the most precious 
of all mankind’s possessions. And 
he was appealing to the crowd on 
the basis of this. He was succeding. 
More and more hostile looks and 



114 



GALAXY 



remarks were directed at Canute. 

Canute felt like hitting Dutton. 
But he also felt helpless. Emotion 
was winning over logic in this 
situation. It would not win in a 
court battle, of course. Or would 
it? Jurors were human. 

The city police arrived and 
took down their evidence. A service 
truck towed away Dutton’s car. 
Canute drove his into the parking 
space and helped Ellen out. 

Ten minutes after the needles 
had been drawn across their 
wrists neither of their scratches 
had yielded inflammation. 

Ellen waited five minutes past 
the reaction time — since people 
did vary — then began weeping 
quietly. 

Jackson guided her out by the 
elbow. As he passed the Duttons, 
he heard the wife say, “1 can’t 
help it that I’m all right and you’re 
not, can I? Is it my fault? And 
what good is it anyway? We’re 
married, aren’t we? And we have 
a baby already, don’t we?” 

Despite Ellen’s grief Jackson 
could not help smiling. Later he 
would feel a little ashamed because 
of his momentary exultation and 
still later he would be sorry for 
Mrs. Dutton. He found, some years 
afterward, that her baby had died 
and that she had divorced Dutton 
and married a fertile man. 

Such news made the papers. 



At the moment he had little 
time to think about the Duttons. 
Ellen sobbed violently in the car. 
He tried to put his arm around 
her and draw her to him, but was 
shoved away. He gave up and drove 
home and when she locked herself 
in her room he went out, got into 
the car and drove to Mike’s. 

August, Year One 

J ACKSON CANUTE had stud- 
ied the reports of his business 
analysts. They confirmed in 
specifics what he had been sure of 
in general. The canning industry 
was overcrowded and would face 
a steadily declining market from 
now on. Even if Canute’s company 
could get a loan, bank or Federal, 
conversion would simply postpone 
bankruptcy to the near future. 

Another complication was that 
the distributors for the canners 
had raised their demands. They 
wanted an official increase of a 
cent a can for their services and an 
under-the-table increase of a cent 
a can. The organization that con- 
trolled the distributors — Canute 
did not doubt they were owned by 
a crime syndicate — was trying to 
grab all the profit it could before 
the market went to hell. 

Six banks, starting with First 
United Federal, had turned down 
Canute. Canute had then called 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



115 



in Kalender and told him that it 
would make no difference if the 
union struck or not. Kalender, 
even though he had expected this, 
turned pale. 

“What about a Federal loan?” 
Kalender asked. 

“If we could get it— and I doubt 
we could — by the time we cleared 
the red tape we would be too late,” 
Jackson said. “It looks as if we’ll 
all be on welfare. And when I say 
all 1 include myself.” 

“That isn’t something to joke 
about.” Kalender looked grim. 
“You’ve got money in the bank, 
powerful friends— and you’re a 
graduate biochemist with a de- 
gree on the side in business 
administration.” 

“It’s none of your business, but 
I have enough in the bank to pay 
for three months’ living and main- 
tenance on my Highview Drive 
mansion. And my powerful friends 
can’t get me a job if none is 
available.” 

Kalender’s surprise was thinly 
filmed over with pleasure. Some- 
thing in him rejoiced in an em- 
ployer’s ill fortune and could not 
be entirely hidden. Canute did not 
resent this. Kalender’s reaction 
was a human one. 

“It takes time to dispose of the 
company,” Canute said. “I can’t 
just lock up and walk away. It’ll 
be six months or more before all 



the paperwork and legal procedures 
are gone through. I hate to think of 
the board of directors’ meetings, 
the stockholders’ meetings, the 
meetings with lawyers and Uncle 
Sam’s representatives and so on — 
to nausea.” 

Kalender stood up. “You think 
it’s going to be easy to tell my men 
they’re out on the streets?” He 
shook hands with Canute. “Good 
luck.” 

“Good luck to you, too,” Canute 
said. “But we’ll be seeing each 
other quite often for several 
months, anyway. It’s funny — 
isn’t it? We’ll see each other more 
while we’re getting rid of the 
business than when we were 
prosperous.” 

August, Year One . 

B USIRIS, Illinois, had at this 
time exactly 200,302 inhabit- 
ants. Of these twelve were naturally 
resistant to the aerosol and pre- 
sumably fertile. Four were married 
to sterile partners. Four were under 
sixteen years of age. One was a 
Roman Catholic nun who had 
objected to being tested but had 
finally given in. One was a lesbian 
living with another lesbian. One 
was a hopelessly insane twenty- 
seven-year-old woman. The twelfth 
was a forty-five-year-old man, 
divorced, childless, diabetic, a 



116 



GALAXY 



misogynist and a firm believer 
in the theory that God intended 
that mankind should perish. Hence, 
under no circumstances, would he 
provide his seed for the survival 
of humanity. 

Other cities all over the world 
revealed similar patterns. 

The rural village of Boseman, 
a few miles west of Busiris, had 
a population of 500 with not one 
naturally resistant person. 

The metropolitan area of New 
York City had approximately 

13.000. 000 population of whom 
650 were resistant. 

Of Earth’s approximately four 
billion population, 200,000 were 
resistant. The figures were not 
quite accurate, since there were 
some pygmy, Negrito, and Amazon 
Indian tribes that had escaped 
the test. Of the 200,000 about half 
were women. Of these 100,000, 
about 25,000 did not seem available 
for reproduction for one reason or 
another, including sterility. That 
a person was resistant to Clabb’s 
aerosol did not mean that he or she 
was fertile. And, if the fertile 
women married to unfertile men 
were included among the unavail- 
able women their total rose to 

85.000. 

“What we must do,” the Chinese 
premier said in his famous Peking 
Statement, “is make the unavail- 
able available.” 



“We will persuade but never 
coerce,” the prime minister of 
England said. 

“Mother Russia demands the 
utmost in sacrifice from, her 
children,” the Soviet premier said. 

The Pope, at the time the first 
complete statistics were compiled, 
had still not made any public 
statement regarding the attitude 
of the Church toward the new 
situation. But he was reported to 
be working on it. 

“Now is the time for every citizen 
to act for the general good first 
and for himself next,” the Presi- 
dent of the United States said. 
“Laws must be enacted to permit 
the citizen to do this.” 

Lister, interviewed the next day, 
said that he would make specific 
proposals at a later, more appro- 
priate time. By this, according to 
some news analysts. Lister meant 
when the public temper had been 
readied to receive radical proposals 
favorably. The analysts were vague 
about what they meant by radical. 

The drunks standing at the bar 
in Mike’s were vague, too, in their 
remarks about the speech and the 
professional comments on it. But 
they were precise enough in their 
adjectives directed at the President 
and the analysts. 

“Listen, Jackson,” Rawley said, 
pushing a dense front of bourbon 
against Jackson’s face. “1 think 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



117 



Lister, the weirdo’s friend, is 
working up to something really 
radical. Like real radical, you 
get me? He hinted, just hinted, 
mind you, in his speech last month 
— you remember, you were at my 
place for dinner — that our present 
system isn’t up to handling this 
crisis. He didn’t say what he 
meant by ‘system.’ But he isn’t 
putting anything over on me. 1 
know his record. I know whom 
he used to hobnob with and whom 
he’d really like to have in his 
cabinet. 1 know all about his 
speeches on the economy of abun- 
dance when he was a young 
Congressman. So — ” 

Jackson listened for a while. 
When Rawley ordered another 
drink Jackson said, “If the house 
is so termite-ridden it’s too late 
for the exterminator, ready to 
fall down, then you tear it down 
and build a new one. You don’t 
just shore it up.’’ 

“What?’’ Rawley asked. 

“The economy’s going to hell, 
has been for a long time. It’s been 
unable to handle its problems at 
even a sixty percent efficiency for 
years. You know that — you just 
won’t admit it. And now that this 
has come along we can’t just fight 
it with the old tired-and-untrue 
methods, you follow me, Rawley?’’ 
The lawyer was slipping away, 
his head drooping and his nose al- 



most in his drink. Jackson stopped 
talking and began the task of 
getting him to his car so he could 
drive him home. Rawley’s wife 
could take a taxi and pick up 
Rawley’s car later. 

September, Year One 

T he president made his famous 
Blessing in Disguise speech 
the day before Labor Day. The 
entire speech lasted sixty minutes 
and was undoubtedly the most 
“compressed” that any president 
had ever made. 

Jackson, working late that 
night, viewed it in his office. He 
sat at his desk with a glass of 
bourbon and ice and sipped while 
Lister made history. 

Lister began by saying that the 
deed — Clabb’s — was done and 
could not be canceled. Now was the 
time for the people of America — 
and of the world — to shed their 
grief and depression. If they were 
to survive as a viable society and 
bequeath their few children a 
viable society — and ensure that 
civilization endured — they must 
perform not miracles but prodigies. 
What they had to do would be dif- 
ficult, but not impossible. They 
must shed old habits of thought 
and action. They must become new 
men. 

And Clabb had opened the way 



118 



GALAXY 



for them, whether or not he had 
intended doing so. The pollution 
problem was taking care of itself 
and would continue to fade away 
as the population became smaller 
and smaller. And although un- 
employment had increased enor- 
mously, this was only a temporary 
situation. Lister anticipated a 
labor shortage in the near future 
if his plans were put into effect. 
The nation would prosper as never 
before from the grassroots upward. 
Poverty would disappear. Anybody 
who wanted an education would 
be able to get it free. Earth would 
be beautified and the generation 
born after the Clabb Effect had 
run its course the fertile genera- 
tion — would be taken care of. It 
would not inherit a world that had 
fallen into howling savagery, as so 
many continued to predict. It 
would inherit a world that was as 
close to paradise as fallible human 
nature could create. 

What the President and his 
advisors envisioned was a society 
progressively cybernated. Every 
industry or service that could be 
equipped with electronic brains and 
mechanical organs and limbs would 
be so equipped. Success would 
ensure that the means of produc- 
tion — from mines to factories to 
transportation to the final dis- 
pensing of goods to the consumers 
— would be as efficient as possible. 



This automation would not de- 
prive people of their jobs. On the 
contrary, more jobs than there 
were people to fill them would be 
available. The total efforts of the 
entire population were needed to 
build the cybernated society and, 
as people passed away — Canute 
lifted his glass in a silent toast 
to the soon-to-be-dead, among 
whom would be himself, maybe — 
the computers and the machines 
would take over. Cybernated 
farms, for example, would continue 
to produce unfalteringly, regardless 
of population changes or shifts. 
Citizens would actually be liberated 
— worthwhile work would replace 
toiling for survival. 

“And how the hell are you going 
to cybernate the farms without 
turning the privately owned ones 
into state-owned combines — and 
what will happen to the farmers 
who are dispossessed?” Canute 
asked his TV set out loud. “To- 
morrow you’ll be accused of being 
a Communist — and the day after 
you’ll be shot by some madman.” 

Lister, it became obvious, had 
asked himself the same questions. 
He took some pains to make sure 
his audience understood him. Pri- 
vate farmers, he promised, would 
be given cybernated equipment 
and trained in its use. Those who 
wanted to learn how to repair and 
maintain the equipment would go 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



119 



to free schools. Those who would 
not or could not master the neces- 
sary skills could call on a pool of 
technicians. 

What Lister did not say at that 
time or later — events simply 

worked out that way — was that if 
a farmer died and left no heirs 
the Government would buy his 
place and turn it into a state farm. 
And if the deceased had heirs the 
treasury department would permit 
adjustments in the inheritance 
tax if the heirs would sell the prop- 
erty to the Government. 

Lister also did not mention that 
the repeal of the Twenty-second 
Amendment to the Constitution 
was already quietly on the way and 
that it would become effective in 
time for him to be elected to a 
third term. And a fourth, fifth 
and sixth. 

Despite the many strong ob- 
jections to Lister’s programs 
later on most of the nation was 
thrilled and cheered by his speech 
that night. Out of bad would come 
good — at least prosperity for 
everybody. He was truly the leader 
of his people — courageous, adapt- 
able. At last, after a series of — 
from the historical viewpoint — 
inept Presidents, a great man had 
risen. 

J ACKSON CANUTE received 
a telephone call two weeks to 



the day after Lister’s speech. 

“The White House, Mr. Ca- 
nute,” Jessica said in a quivering 
voice. 

The President? Canute’s heart 
banged like a loose valve. 

His caller was not Lister but one 
of the President’s large staff of 
undersecretaries. He asked how 
Canute was, said that he was glad 
in response to Canute’s: “Fine — ” 
and promised that Canute would re- 
ceive a letter from the President 
himself, or at least one originally 
composed and signed by him. It 
would confirm this call and spell 
out in more personal detail the 
President’s plans. This was 
merely an overall briefing on what 
Canute might expect. 

Canute knew, in outline, the 
purpose and the setup of CONES, 
The Committee of National Eco- 
nomic Standards. The news media 
had talked and printed enough 
about it. Now he was being asked 
if he would serve on the local 
board — if, in fact, he would help 
organize it under the supervision 
of the local chairman. The chair- 
man had recommended Canute 
because he knew that Canute would 
not be occupied with his business 
and because Canute had the neces- 
sary qualifications. One of these 
was that he was a prominent mem- 
ber of the President’s political 
party and a good friend of the 



120 



GALAXY 



chairman. But there was more to 
it than that, of course. 

Canute said that he would give 
a verbal acceptance now and a 
written one later. He thanked the 
secretary and watched the fading 
image with great satisfaction. 

Jessica was too disciplined to 
ask him what the call had been 
about. Canute, not being con- 
sciously sadistic, summoned her 
and gave her the news. Jessica 
looked even more beautiful when 
she was thrilled — and she was 
certainly at her most beautiful 
now. The contrast between her 
and Ellen, who had been looking 
and acting more and more haggish 
lately, was strong and troubling. 
Jessica never bothered Jackson 
and obviously adored him. Her 
reaction to the sterility problem 
continued markedly different from 
Ellen’s. If she suffered grief she 
had not allowed it to show or sour 
her outlook. She had been married 
once, briefly, and though she had 
never said much about it, she had 
mentioned a year ago — she and 
Jackson had been working late — 
that any man she loved would 
have to compete with her dead 
father. Jackson had decided then 
and there that their relationship 
would always be that of employer 
and employee. He would never 
compete with a ghost, he had told 
himself. More than once. 



Jessica was so thrilled now that 
she kissed him quickly on the lips 
and then, laughing, ran back to 
the outer office. Jackson had not 
kissed a woman for ten days — Ellen 
had begun to turn her cheek to 
him and for the past four days he 
had quit trying for even that. 

Well, marriage meant more than 
kisses and every mentally stable 
woman got over her depressions. 
If Ellen were to become happy 
again Canute would be happy. He 
did not know what more he could 
do to bring her out of her pit. He 
had tried everything he could 
within the little time phasing out 
Canute Baby Foods, Inc., allowed 
him these days. He had tried to 
get her to go to a psychiatrist or 
go with him to a marriage coun- 
selor. But she had refused. These 
men could not make her fertile, 
she had said. She had emphasized 
men, making it plain that he was 
a member of that guilty set. 
Probably, more accurately, he was 
in an inner circle consisting only 
of himself — the man who had put 
off having children. 

He had asked her if she would 
like to adopt a child. She had 
said no — she wanted one of her 
own. He had thought she might 
change her mind and had investi- 
gated possibilities. They were none 
existent — he was far too late. The 
day after the release of Clabb’s 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



121 



letter the orphanages had been 
avalanched with requests for 
adoption. 

Ellen was also suffering from the 
shock of being no longer married 
to an affluent man. She had ob- 
jected vigorously — had even 
thrown ash trays at him — when he 
had told her that the house must 
be put up for sale, though there 
was little chance it could be sold 
without a great loss. The real- 
estate market had caved in. 

Now, however, the CONES 
position would pay him $100,000 
a year. Inflation made that equal 
to about $45,000 of ten years ago. 
He wouldn’t suffer and he could 
keep the house, but he certainly 
was not going to be affluent again. 
He and Ellen would have to watch 
the budget very closely. And it 
might be best to sell at a loss that 
could be partially deducted from 
his income tax if he purchased a 
smaller home in the same year. 

He poured bourbon into two 
glasses of ice and called Jessica 
back for a toast. She would not 
be out of a job after all, he told 
her. As a CONES board member 
he would need a battery of secre- 
taries — whom she could boss. He 
would have enough budget to pay 
for them. Not to mention — as he 
did not — that he was going to have 
considerable influence and power 
as a CONES official. 



So here’s to our future, Jessica! 

April, Year Three 

W ITH an annual death rate of 
nine per 1,000 inhabitants 
Busiris should have lost 5,400 
citizens in three years. But the 
suicide, homicide and fatal accident 
rates had risen sharply. The popu- 
lation, instead of 194,600, was now 
approximately 183,800. However, 
the suicides and homicides seemed 
to be leveling to pre-Clabb times. 

The lack of births and the at- 
trition by death were so far almost 
unnoticeable. When Canute drove 
to work or downtown — or some- 
times just around the town — he 
saw few empty houses. The only 
sights that really hit him were the 
day nurseries. 

The nurseries were completely 
shut down. He saw children play- 
ing on the school grounds during 
recess, but he knew that the kinder- 
gartens and low grades would 
soon be empty. For years the 
schools had been steadily getting 
more overcrowded. But before long 
classes would be cut down in size 
and more teachers per pupil would 
be available. 

Canute, as a CONES board 
member — chairman now, in fact 
— was also educational supervisor. 
He toured the schools from time to 
time, though most of the overseeing 



122 



GALAXY 



was done by a secretary. In three 
years his budget had tripled and he 
now had twice as many people 
working for him as at the begin- 
ning. He had much power, but his 
responsibilities and work had also 
increased. He had been feted a 
number of times, approached by 
many who wanted favors, and 
had been beaten badly by four men 
who had called him a “tool of the 
Government,” among other things. 
He was lucky. One CONES mem- 
ber had been shot in the brain late 
at night as he got into his car in the 
parking lot. The killers had pinned 
a button to his bloody coat — above 
the letters FFF was a hand holding 
a lighted torch. Fighters For 
Freedom. The underground revo- 
lutionaries. Unlike the under- 
ground of the past, this group was 
composed of “reactionaries,” men 
who wanted the old system kept 
intact, who still insisted that the 
old structures were suited for 
solving the new problems. 

As it had turned out, a jealous 
husband had hired three men to 
murder the CONES official and 
had succeeded for a time in putting 
the blame on the underground. 
The jealous husband had happened 
to be the man responsible for 
Canute’s appointment to the 
board, its first chairman. The 
resultant scandal had been used 
by opponents of the Government 



in an effort to discredit its policies. 

Canute had been appointed the 
new chairman and had accepted 
the position in the midst of heavy 
criticism. One of his bitterest 
critics — and the most influential 
— was the editor-publisher of the 
Busiris Journal-Sun. Caleb Tooney 
was sixty years old, a lifelong 
conservative and a big stockholder 
in the huge Earthmover Diesel 
Works of Busiris. He was also a 
vigorous enemy of Lister and his 
policies. Many of his editorials 
prophesied that Lister would have 
to suspend certain portions of the 
Constitution, such as civil rights, 
if he were to carry out his plans 
efficiently. That Tooney could 
print his editorials seemed to be 
the best refutation of his prophesies. 

July, Year Five 

W ’HEN the Busiris Journal- 
Sun building burned down the 
police chief blamed arsonists. He 
produced evidence that the fire had 
been set, but found nothing to 
help him make an arrest. Some 
psychotic might have set it 
simply because he liked to watch 
the flames. Tooney claimed pri- 
vately that the Government in- 
telligence people had set the fire, 
though he did not directly accuse 
Lister. 

Canute wondered.

He told himself that the fate 
of humanity was at stake. Strong 
Government measures had to be 
taken, measures that he himself 
would have condemned as criminal 
in ordinary circumstances, but 
might consider justified in the 
light of current emergencies. 

He next told himself that he was 
indulging in cowardly ration- 
alizations. What good if man 
survived if he had to build a 
repressive society to survive in? 
Actually Tooney’s paper had acted 
as a safety valve for those who 
needed to blow off steam. It had 
been ineffective in hindering 
CONES. And it had called at- 
tention to the blunderings, the 
arrogances and the fracturing of 
people’s rights, all of which the 
Government now and then was 
guilty of. 

Whatever good or evil the paper 
had done, it was now through. 
Tooney was a stubborn old man. 
He tried to raise funds and get bank 
loans to rebuild his plant. He had 
been unable to collect his insurance 
because he had apparently failed 
to hire a sufficient number of 
security guards and set up the 
expensive alarm system the in- 
surance people had specified. 
Tooney took the matter to court. 
The case was not tried until a year 
later and then it dragged on for six 
years in the lower and then the 



higher courts before Tooney lost. 
Meanwhile a more liberal syndicate 
announced plans to start a new 
paper, the Busirian. It never got off 
to a good starl. The citizens of 
Busiris had to subscribe to out-of- 
town papers, usually a Chicago or 
St. Louis sheet, or catch the news 
on the local TV channel. In time 
one nationwide network dropped 
all programing except for news 
and eventually replaced the 
printed medium. 

Canute checked around and saw 
a pattern suddenly taking shape 
around the country. Fires, 
bankruptcies, labor trouble, loss of 
advertising, sudden raises in 
taxes and outright vandalism 
were killing the remaining news- 
papers. In many cases nothing 
spectacular happened to a paper 
— except that a local TV station 
had become a full-time news 
agency and people quit subscribing. 
The Government was lending 
money to the TV news stations 
but not to the newspapers. It 
always had reasonable grounds for 
its refusals. The best was that it 
did not want to invest the tax- 
payers’ dollars in a losing 
proposition. 

October, Year Seven 

D ECPOP had reduced the citi- 
zens of Busiris to 176,625. 



124 



GALAXY 



The loss of 23,677 was somewhat 
noticeable but still not spooky. 
In fact, there were no empty houses 
in the better residential areas. 
When an owner died heirless — or 
his heirs were bought out — the 
Government gave loans to certain 
selected citizens of the poverty 
sections. These folks moved into 
the hitherto exclusive areas. 

Jackson Canute lived in the most 
exclusive district. Six black 
families owned homes within two 
blocks of his. The blocks were, 
however, exceptionally long, the 
equivalent of three ordinary 
blocks. The heads of the black 
families were lawyers, doctors 
and college professors. 

As Jackson passed through the 
neighboring district, which had 
homes in the $75,000-$50,000 
class, he saw a score of black faces 
in hitherto honky homes. Their 
occupants, he knew, had once 
lived in the middle-class black 
area on the west side. Now they 
had moved up. 

The people in, poverty areas won 
their Government loans — and 
the chance to move — in restricted 
lotteries. But the winners Canute 
discovered without being able to 
prove his point, were carefully 
chosen. They were ambitious types 
who wanted to advance, who could 
be counted on to continue to con- 
form to the Government’s de- 



finition of “responsible citizens.” 

The Government was trying to 
siphon off the ghetto people with 
discretion. Others besides Jackson 
discovered the trend and there 
were riots and court actions. The 
riots were contained by law- 
enforcement officials and the court 
actions dragged endlessly. The 
protesters included both blacks and 
whites and each had reason to cry 
injustice. 

As chairman of the CONES 
board, Canute had more actual 
power than the city manager of 
Busiris. He used it to organize 
a survey of the South Side poor 
whites. He discovered far fewer 
qualified candidates than the 
black ghetto produced — virtually 
no professional people and almost 
as few qualified on the basis of 
real ambition. Jackson recognized 
the social factors behind the 
phenomenon, but he could not help 
or alter those. He concluded that 
the Government was trying to 
make the necessary social 
transition as easy as possible and 
was, for once, conducting itself in 
a sensible manner. He did, 
however, discover enough whites 
to balance the blacks who had 
been moved into the neighborhood 
adjacent to his own. He began to 
move them whenever there was an 
opening. This resulted in accusa- 
tions of discrimination by blacks — 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



125 



as well as by some whites — and his 
days and nights grew even more 
troubled. 

Power was its own high pay, but 
its by-products were nerve-twisting 
ulcer-generating and also fatigue- 
causing. Even behind the buffer of 
his secretarial battery Jackson was 
beset with letters, phone calls, 
people catching him outside his 
office, waiting on the porch of his 
home. Once a note wrapped around 
a rock was thrown through his 
living-room window. The note held 
money to pay for the window, but 
Jackson had the man arrested 
anyway. 

Ellen left him the next day. The 
rock-throwing was only one of a 
long series of incidents she had 
complained about. But she and 
Jackson had been quarreling more 
and more — their reconciliations 
were fewer and lasted a shorter 
time. Yet, if he had been able to 
spend more time with her, if she 
had not also been bothered by the 
petitioners, they might have been 
able to make peace. 

Year Eight 

J ACKSON missed Ellen, but not 
very much. He married Jessica 
six months after his divorce. They 
were fairly happy, though she 
complained about his frequent 
absences. She continued to work 



for him, but he was gone much of 
the day from the office and much 
of the evening from home. She 
did have her bad times about being 
sterile and sometimes had night- 
mares about the end of the world. 
But these were infrequent and, in 
any event, she did not blame him 
for them. 

Then Jessica thought she was 
pregnant. Pseudopregnancies had 
become a common phenomenon 
during the first ten years after 
Clabb. Often the pseudopregnancy 
was actually a large tumor, 
swiftly growing and all too 
frequently malignant and metasta- 
tic. It was as if a deep, unconscious 
desire in certain women to re- 
produce and so save humanity 
caused the growth of cells — 
certainly some such feeling kept 
many from early treatment. The 
growth was usually wild and re- 
sulted in the deaths of many 
women — so many that the annual 
death rate jumped from nine per 
thousand (in the first three years 
after Clabb) to eleven per thousand 
by the eighth year. 

Jessica died at the end of the 
eighth year. 

Perhaps this type of malignancy 
was, some psychologists specu- 
tated, one of the results of the end- 
of-the-world syndrome. Generally, 
the syndrome itself was a vague 
phenomenon, hence difficult to 



126 



GALAXY 



grapple with and conquer. It was 
like a question that could not be 
precisely phrased and so was 
unanswerable. Not many people 
went insane because of it. But it 
took the joy out of much of the 
work and the play. It bleached the 
skies, painted the Earth pale and 
it malformed men’s unconscious 
minds. 

Jackson Canute liked to think 
that he was exempt from this 
feeling. Up to Year Zero B.C. 
(Before Clabb, the news media 
facetiously had dubbed it), he had 
had work that had at least satisfied 
him. He had been a useful member 
of the community, administering 
an industry that supplied infants 
with nutrition. Now he was 
administering what was essentially 
a phasing-out operation. But it was 
the most gigantic and longest 
phasing out in history and he 
was playing an important part, 
even if only on a local scale. He 
loved more than anything to run 
an organization, to plan ahead on 
a large scale and to deal directly 
with people on the small scale. 

Other people were not so happy, 
but that was the way things went 
and part of his job was to try to 
improve their dispositions. 

But his basic goal, of course, was 
the greatest good for the most 
people — which meant that a 
minority was sure to be unhappy. 



H e had been responsible for 
handling the case of Miss 
Scroop, the lesbian whom the 
FCP tests had revealed as fertile. 
She had announced that she was 
willing to have children. Her 
stipulations were that the con- 
ception must be brought about by 
artificial insemination and that 
she could legally be married to 
her lover. Miss Windsor. 

The great furor over this 
climaxed in the eighth year after 
Clabb. Time (still a magazine and 
not a TV station at this time) ran 
three articles on the two women, 
giving Canute much favorable 
publicity. Miss Scroop’s employer 
fired her when she made her 
announcement and, when Canute 
could not get the employer to take 
her back, he hired her as a secre- 
tary. The two women received 
many threatening letters — Canute 
himself received a hundred. (No 
telephone calls were made, since 
every phone automatically showed 
on its screen the number of the 
other instrument.) Some public- 
spirited citizens beat up Miss 
Scroop’s ex-employer. 

Miss Scroop insisted that she 
would not bear children unless 
she could be legally married. 
That the Illinois legislature im- 
mediately made this possible 
showed how public opinion had 
changed. No lawmaker in the 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



127 



state would have dared to propose 
such an enabling act a year earlier. 

Ten months later Mrs. Windsor, 
as she now called herself, bore the 
first of five children. Jackson 
watched the interview as she left 
the hospital with the baby. 

TV interviewer: “Mrs. Windsor, 
are you happy?” 

Windsor: “Oh, very. My mate, 
Glenda, is also very happy.” 

Interviewer: “Is it true that 
you’re planning to bring up your 
baby as a lesbian?” 

Windsor: “You (censored), if I 
weren’t holding my child I’d kick 
you right in the (censored). Get 
out of my way, you (censored) 
man, you!” 

The interviewer had dared to say 
in public what many had said in 
private or in letters to the news 
media editors. 

In her final interview with Time 
Mrs. Windsor stated that the child 
would be raised “properly.” 

“Of course, I was raised by two 
heterosexuals and look how I 
turned out. So who knows about 
Sappho?” 

Eventually the two Windsors and 
the child left Busiris to live in 
Nova City, the Federal establish- 
ment outside Asheville, North 
Carolina. There they resided in 
a house some called palatial and 
there they were free of harassment. 

The fertile nun. Sister Gratian, 



had been released from her vows 
on the condition she marry and 
have children. The only fertile man 
of her faith in Busiris became avail- 
able when his wife died during 
childbirth. Mr. Bunding married 
Sister Gratian, who left him the 
day after their wedding night. She 
gave no reason and Mr. Bunding 
was speechless. Mrs. Bunding 
lived for a year in an apartment at 
the other end of town from her 
husband and then went to Nova 
City. However, she bore Mr. 
Bunding six children, all by 
artificial insemination. The church 
did not object to the precedure as 
long as the donor was her own 
husband. 

N ova city had been estab- 
lished by the Federal Govern- 
ment as a center for the “main- 
tenance of the nation’s greatest 
resources.” Precedents had been 
set by several other countries, 
notably China, Japan, Indonesia, 
Israel, the United Arab Republic, 
Brazil and the U.S.S.R. These 
nations had made it mandatory for 
fertile women to bear at least 
seven times and substantial 
bonuses were awarded for each 
child. The U.S. Congress liberally 
funded Nova City and did its best 
to attract fertile couples to 
residence there. There were protests 
that the free and luxurious living 



128 



GALAXY 



for the fertiles was discriminatory. 
The reply, disseminated over the 
news media, was that not all 
discrimination was bad. Not if it 
helped humanity — and especially 
the United States of America — to 
survive. 

Some radicals proposed that all 
nations agree to support a single 
international community where 
all the fertiles of the world could 
be gathered. This would form, in 
effect, a new state. The common 
language for its citizens would be 
the newly revised Esperanto or 
Loglan 111— and in time all man- 
kind would have rid itself of the 
problems and evils of national 
boundaries, nationalism and dif- 
fering languages. 

The idea sounded good to many, 
but it was, of course, impossible 
to get any nation to accept the 
concept as a workable reality. 
Each hung on to its own fertiles. 

S AN MARINO, the tiny 
Italian-speaking nation, had 
one fertile. She and her husband 
and six children took the highest 
offer and migrated secretly to the 
United States to live in Nova City. 
Furious protests rose from other 
nations, especially Italy, which had 
hoped to get her. The husband of 
the woman was sterile, but he 
showed a remarkable liberality 
in view of his faith and permitted 



his wife to have six more children 
by artificial insemination. Outcries 
were heard in the United States 
that the Federal Government was 
promoting immorality, but the 
majority of citizens seemed to 
approve. It was felt that the need 
to survive overrode conventional 
morality. 

T he Republic of South Africa 
(in Year One) had 150 fertile 
white, 23- Asian and 271 black 
women. The Republic set up 
separate equivalents of Nova City 
for each of the three categories of 
persons. The Asian women all 
perished with husbands and child- 
ren when their transport plane 
crashed en route to their estab- 
lishment. A year later the 271 
black women died when an am- 
munition dump next to the 
establishment exploded. The 
Republic officials made several 
explanations about why the dump 
had been set up next to the black 
“national resources.” Neither the 
plane crash nor the explosion were 
ever proved to be anything but 
accidents. But the black population 
was enraged, and civil war — or a 
rebellion, depending upon whose 
side you were on — flamed. Before 
the whites finally stamped out the 
uprising, a raid on the white fer- 
tiles resulted in their massacre — 
only five survived. The black under- 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



129 



ground vowed to get these, but the 
five were smuggled out of the 
country and came to the U.S., 
which promised them the highest 
standard of living. 

W EST SAMOA began with 
four fertile women. This 
scarcity was common throughout 
the Polynesian area. Many South 
Pacific nations and territorial 
possessions did not have the critical 
minimum of fertiles needed to en- 
sure the perpetuation of their 
human populations. A Greater 
Polynesian Confederation was ad- 
vocated with all the fertiles relo- 
cated on Tahiti, the original 
homeland (according to some 
authorities). This was rejected by 
the nations owning the islands or 
having mandates over them. Never- 
theless, all the fertile men and 
women of the South Pacific area 
were sneaked out of their home- 
lands and established in West 
Samoa. (By now this practice was 
being called, among other things, 
wombnaping.) A war between 
England and the U.S- on one side — 
defending the Greater Polynesian 
Confederation — and the French 
and Chileans on the other side — 
they wanted their Polynesian 
fertiles back — seemed to be a 
possibility if the news media of 
the countries involved were to be 
believed. 



The Polynesian experiment 
worked surprisingly well. The East 
African Bantu Union, formed 
for the purpose of putting together 
the fertiles of Zambia, Malawi, 
Kenya, Rwanda, Urubu, and 
Mozambique, failed. Tribal dif- 
ferences were too great to surmount 
— the fertiles eventually went back 
to their home territories and the 
Union broke up.' 

C ANADA was the world’s 
second largest nation in area 
but had a population of only 
21,100,000 in Year One. It had 
1038 white, 13 Indian and four 
black fertiles. Every one of the 
Indians belonged to a different 
tribe. Of the blacks, one lived in 
Toronto, one in Quebec, one in 
Saskatoon and one in Vancouver. 
The 13 Canadian Indians invited 
the 33 fertile Amerinds in the 
United States to come live with 
them on the shore of the Great 
Slave Lake, where a new Indian 
nation would be started. The 
idea was that the small group 
would form the nucleus of a tribe 
that would eventually spread out 
into the North American wilder- 
ness. They would live much as had 
their pre-Columbian ancestors, 
except that they would have 
certain indispensable gadgets, of 
course. 

The U.S. objected to its Indians 



130 



GALAXY 



leaving its territory (this was 
while it was defending the 
Polynesians’ rights to leave theirs). 
The 33 Indians sneaked into 
Canada anyway and, while ex- 
tradition proceedings were drag- 
ging, Canada and the U.S. merged 
into the United States of North 
America, the U.S.N.A. 

The newly created tribe — calling 
itself The First Men — adopted 
English as its common language. 
Many years later, when the tribe 
had expanded through the great 
land which had reverted to wilder- 
ness, it presented the curious phe- 
nomenon of Amerinds speaking 
English and named, because of 
their origin, Slavs. (Slav was the 
pronunciation of Slave, from The 
Great Slave Lake.) 

July, Year Twenty 

B USIRIS had lost 40,000 of its 
citizens, mostly to the 
graveyard. It had also gained fifty, 
but had lost them to Nova City. 
These were the children of the 
children who had been under 
sixteen in Year Zero, B.C. They 
had moved out with their parents. 

It was strange, Canute thought, 
to drive through the city and not 
see a single person under twenty. 
In fact, not many under thirty 
were visible. 

The number of empty houses and 



vacant lots was beginning to be 
noticeable. The Government now 
tore down houses as soon as they 
became ownerless. The lots were 
turfed, planted with trees and 
flowers. They not only gave a 
parklike appearance to residential 
areas, but ensured that when the 
re-expanding population eventually 
arrived it would find a more wel- 
coming vista than over grown 
ruins. 

The long-range plan was to 
level all of the city gradually, step 
by step, death by death — one 
future day a visitor might never 
know that Busiris had stood here 
until he came to the stele in the 
middle of a forest. The stele, al- 
ready in the project stage, would 
carry a brief record of the city’s 
history. Even the cemeteries were 
planned for obsolescence — the 
wild would take them over when 
all the living had left. 

Canute’s grave would be lost 
with the others — his name, 
however, would be on the stele. 
“For all eternity,’’ a government 
official had told him. 

Canute had smiled. How many 
vanished monuments had been set 
up for all time? And how long did 
it take Time to prove that for all 
human artifacts there was no 
such thing as forever? Marble 
was only a little more enduring 
than bone — then it, too, went the 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



131 



way of all matter shaped by man. 

The official had correctly in- 
terpreted Canute’s smile. “But 
this stele will be of inertum — 
indestructible. It will last forever!” 

Canute had shrugged. “But I 
will be dead and no children of 
mine will see my name.” 

One morning he drove through 
the South Side, ostensibly on an of- 
ficial checkup, actually just to take 
a drive. Twenty years ago the area 
had consisted of slums, tenements 
and Federal housing projects, 
breeding grounds of crime, disease 
and misery. Its habitable buildings, 
tenanted mostly by blacks but with 
a minority of poor whites, had 
needed maintenance. Its yards had 
been grassless and littered with 
paper, cans, cigarette butts. Its 
driveways had been cluttered with 
rusty or torn-down cars. The unin- 
habitable buildings had stared 
through broken windows past 
obscene letterings and drawings. 

Today no sign of the ghetto re- 
mained. The inhabitants had been 
moved into the better residential 
districts. All buildings had been 
razed, removed and replaced by 
grass and trees. The area was now 
bounded by a man-made lake, 
stocked with fish. 

Protests had accompanied the 
changes and much conflict had 
arisen between those moved into 
choicer areas and people already 



living there. But the friction had 
not been as bad as had been ex- , 
pected and twenty years — and 
relative freedom from want — had 
reshaped the deghettoized into 
reasonable facsimiles of middle- 
class citizenry. The misery and 
even blood-letting of two decades 
ago had been generally forgotten. 

J ACKSON was thinking, as he 
drove his electric car slowly 
through the South Side, that ! 
Busiris had been lucky in its 

transitional procedures because it 
had had a small minority of poor 
people. The New York City 
metropolitan area, with its im- 
mense minorities, had not yet 

solved its problems. Nor would 
it until they were cut down to size 
even more than had been done. Its 
pre-decpop population had been . 
15,000,000. A normal death rate 
would not have made too radical a 
change in it, but the suicide and 
murder rates had increased greatly 
and the terrible August riots of 
twelve years ago had cost the 

area approximately 1,000,000 
deaths. The burning of Harlem 
during the riots, the spreading of 
the fire to other areas, had re- 
sulted in 200,000 deaths in six 
days. The army, navy and national 
guard had taken over and a dis- 
persion of the populace had been 



132 



GALAXY 



arranged, partly under Federal 
auspices. 

In the general dispersion — the 
Second Diaspora some called it — 
Busiris had received 350 of the 
dispossessed. Most of these were 
of Puerto Rican descent. Canute 
had housed them where he could— 
in the emptied orphanages and 
grade schools, dwellings vacated 
but not yet torn down — and then 
he had fed them out, little by little, 
to various residential districts. 
He had easily found jobs for them 
— at that time a labor shortage 
had been a major problem. Their 
adaptation to a middle-sized 
Midwestern city had not been 
easy, however, and Canute, as a 
sort of ombudsman, had put in 
many weary hours trying to make 
them happy. 

One of them had been Maria 
Gutierrez, a computer programer, 
beautiful, dark-eyed, red-haired, 
in her ealy twenties. Canute’s 
affair with her had begun during 
Jessica’s final illness and after 
her death he had married Maria. 

He was sure that the disparity in 
their ages would cause trouble, 
but meanwhile he was enjoying her, 
especially since she did not com- 
plain much about his seldom being 
at home. Maria had a low-keyed 
sexual desire. She responded quite 
satisfactorily but never complained 
about wanting more. All in all, she 



was a fine wife for a man in his 
middle years who was often tired 
from his labors. 

C ANUTE glanced into his 
rearview mirror and saw a 
steamwagon tailgaiting him. It 
bothered him to be followed so 
closely while he was taking a 
pleasure drive and he slowed to 
let the other driver pass. The car 
did pull around, but it suddenly 
cut in, forcing Canute to kick the 
brake pedal in all the way. The 
tires screeched as the steam engine 
quit and locked the four wheels. 
The hood of Canute’s car rammed 
into the wrap-around bumper of 
the wagon. 

The man who got out of the car 
looked familiar to Canute. But 
not until he saw the revolver did 
full recognition dawn. He was 
shocked. Twenty years had passed 
since the young fellow in the Volks- 
wagen had tried to beat him into 
the parking slot at the Raywoods 
High School — the man looked 
older now, but the stubborn wrong- 
ness about him was the same. That 
wrongness, now emphasized by 
the pistol, had first jogged Canute’s 
memory. 

“What do you want?” Canute 
asked, feeling his insides coiling 
coldly. The muzzle of the pistol — a 
Colt .45 six-shooter, probably a 
hundred years old and a real col- 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



133 



lector’s item — looked enormous. 

“To pay you back,” the man said 
and then he must have fired the 
pistol. 

C ANUTE awoke to pain, dim- 
ness and confusion more than 
once. Eventually he was fully 
awake in a hospital bed. One 
bullet, undoubtedly the first, had 
struck the side of his head a glanc- 
ing blow. The second had gone into 
his chest at an angle and come out 
along the front of his breastbone. 
The third had pierced his right 
thigh. 

“A police car came along, other- 
wise the maniac would have emp- 
tied his gun into you,” the doctor 
said. “He fired at the police instead 
and they were forced to kill him.” 
“But why would he want to kill 
me?” Canute said. “The incident 
in the parking lot was minor — and 
happened twenty years ago.” 

“He’s been in a Los Angeles 
mental hospital for ten years,” 
the doctor said. “I’ve read the 
whole transcript. According to his 
psychiatrist, he has blamed you 
for his baby’s death and his wife’s 
divorcing him. He claimed a bump 
the baby got when your cars col- 
lided caused the tumor that killed 
him. There is, of course, no evi- 
dence whatever that that’s what 
happened — and in any case, the 
police records here show that he 



was responsible for that old acci- 
dent. Anyway, he escaped six 
months ago. He stole the revolver 
and ammunition from a Dodge 
City museum on his way here. The 
police learned that a stranger was 
in town — ” 

“A stranger in town? Since when 
has it been illegal to be new in a 
town?” 

“You’re still not thinking 
clearly,” the doctor said. 

“Oh, yes,” Canute said. He 
thought for a moment. “Yes, I 
see.” 

The police force had swelled 
enormously since Year Zero. 
Lister had insisted on enough man- 
power at local levels to keep down 
riots and help maintain full em- 
ployment. The standards for the 
police had been raised at every 
level, local, state and Federal, and 
all levels were in constant com- 
munication with each other. The 
numbers of the police had been 
maintained despite the decline in 
population. Any policeman was 
likely to know everyone in his 
precincts and strangers were im- 
mediately spotted. It had become 
routine for motorized patrolmen 
to compare any stranger’s features 
with mug shots and films trans- 
mitted over the car’s phone. Los 
Angeles must have had Dutton’s 
photos on the air. 

The doctor left. When Canute 



134

awoke again a nurse was standing 
beside his bed. She was attractive 
and younger than Jackson Canute. 

She smiled and said, “Good 
afternoon, Mr. Canute. I’m 
Amanda Tilkeson. How do you 
feel?” 

“Better, after seeing you,” he 
told her. 

“Thank you, Mr. Canute. The 
sensors indicate you’re in very good 
shape. You should be hungry.” 

“I am,” he said. 

“The roboserver will bring you 
your meal,” she said. “But the 
aids will bring your supper.” 

“Good.” 

Canute watched her walk away. 
The hospital was so completely 
cybernated that one nurse could 
manage a whole floor. But Lister 
had said — no doubt a medical 
psychologist had written that par- 
ticular speech — that cybernation 
was only an aid in hospital care 
and that the sick needed humans 
around. 

C ANUTE had written his auto- 
biography in his off-moments 
during the past ten years. Pub- 
lishing individual works was now 
the Government’s business and 
Jackson had had no trouble getting 
his life story and thoughts into 
print. What would or would not 
sell no longer decided acceptance 
of a book. Lister had long ago 



announced publicly that he wanted 
“every voice in the land to be 
heard.” 

The Government could not, of 
course, print and distribute a mil- 
lion copies of every book submitted 
to it and it would have been un- 
democratic to set up committees 
of learned and distinguished critics 
to screen out the “bad” stuff. The 
problem had been tackled at first 
by printing cheap editions of every 
manuscript submitted, regardless 
of merit, and limiting the number 
of copies. Distribution had been 
through the “feedies” or Federal 
stores. The books had been given 
to those who asked for them. When 
the supply was gone no more books 
had been printed unless they had 
received a good rating by readers. 
About half of the readers had used 
the rating machines in the stores 
and about one-eighth of the books 
had been reprinted in larger edi- 
tions and for wider distribution. 

The system had soon proved 
unworkable — it was too happen- 
stance. Many worthwhile works 
had been lost forever while tra.sh 
survived. Critics had discussed 
books on television shows and often 
they had .decided a book’s fate. 
Sometimes the critics had had 
personal axes to grind. The situa- 
tion had served, however, to define 
the problems and point up a need 
and soon Lister had had his top

cybernetists working on solutions. 

They had come up with one. 

Every citizen today was issued a 
number of linders. These, named 
after their inventor, George Linder, 
consisted of “books” thirty centi- 
meters square by six centimeters 
thick and weighing thirty-two 
grams. Each contained, on delivery, 
ten thousand blank pages. The 
owner could then get from the 
feedie a cassette (the size of a match 
folder) containing, in coded elec- 
tronic form, an entire book. He 
would plug the cassette into the 
back of the Under and connect the 
works to the household electric 
power source. With the book on a 
flat surface, he would rub the in- 
dicated spot on the cassette with 
his thumb or the end of a pencil 
and the Under would start opera- 
tion. Minutes later, the cassette 
would trill and the owner could 
disconnect the power source. Open- 
ing the Under he would find the 
book he wished to read printed out, 
with illustrations in color. 

When the owner was through 
with the book he could erase it. If 
he intended to read the particular 
work again he kept the cassette. 
Otherwise he returned the cassette. 
The linders were reusable almost 
indefinitely. 

The cassettes could also be 
plugged into a TV adapter to dis- 
play the contents of the book on 



the screen. A manual remote- 
control device regulated the speed 
of the display. 

For the first time in history any- 
body who wanted to publish could 
do so within certain limits. The 
original printing of the work of any 
previously unpublished author was 
confined to fifty thousand cassettes. 
If there was a demand for more, 
the Government would fill it. Pub- 
lishing credits entitling an author 
to larger printing accrued auto- 
matically and were based on 
reader demand. 



C anute’s autobiography had 
been received well in Busiris 
but outside the city he was little 
known. Amanda Tilkeson, the 
nurse-technician, dropped into his 
hospital room now and then to 
discuss the book with him. She 
admired it very much. Canute did 
not really think much of its intrin- 
sic interest or literary merits, but 
it was pleasant to have someone 
admire it. Maria had read it but 
had said that she had had difficulty 
getting through it. Canute dis- 
covered another bond between 
himself and Amanda. She was a 
fishing and boating nut, as was 
he — Maria hated to get out on the 
water — and they talked about 
water sports. 

All in all, after the pain lessened 



136 



GALAXY 



and he could get out of his cyber- 
nated bed into a cybernated 
wheelchair, Canute enjoyed the 
hospital stay. Maria, very much 
concerned at first, began to reveal 
a side of herself he had not seen 
before. She seemed to resent the 
rapport between Canute and 
Amanda — possibly she was re- 
membering her own first meetings 
with him while he had still been 
married to Jessica. 

She now said that the reason she 
had not liked his autobiography 
had been that it reminded her of 
how much he had neglected her. 
When he told her that it was news 
to him that she felt neglected at all 
she went into a tirade. 

“Don’t give me that jazz about 
sacrificing yourself for others! You 
like what you’re doing! You prefer 
working to being with me. I bore 
you. But your work doesn’t. So 
you’re being selfish — you’re not 
doing what you do to help people. 
You couldn’t care less for them.” 

“What’s the difference?” he 
asked. “It’s the results that count. 
And whether I help all these people 
because I want to help or because 
1 feel a compulsion to do this sort 
of work doesn’t matter. I admit 
I’m selfish and shallow. So what? 
The local affairs run smoothly — 
people are taken care of and helped 
and I’m happy, regardless of my 
motives.” 



“Then why don’t you care about 
making me happy?” 

He was honestly puzzled and 
surprised, but he did not particu- 
larly care. 

“If I sat around at home watch- 
ing TV and discussing your prob- 
lems in raising our dogs — then I 
would be unhappy. It’s up to you to 
find something to keep yourself 
from being bored. I’ve asked you 
a thousand times to come down to 
work in the office.” 

“That makes me so tired I could 
vomit!” 

She left him with a cold kiss on 
his cheek and a frown. Amanda 
came in shortly and, though she 
said nothing she acted as if she had 
been listening in on the intercom. 
Her expression was one of 
sympathy. 

“If you got married again,” he 
asked, “would you want to work 
or be a housewife?” 

“Work,” she said. “If I could 
have children — well, that would 
be different. I had one child just 
before Clabb. She’s twenty-five 
now and sterile. But she’s working 
in Nova City.” 

She stopped. A red light was 
pulsing on the instrument panel. 
Outside, the footsteps of a woman 
hurrying toward the room could be 
heard. A nurse entered. 

“Mr. Guglielmo’s dead!” she 
told Amanda. “And just a minute 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



137 



ago he seemed in fine health — ” 
She did not cry but she looked as 
if she would like to. 

“He was such a good man!” she 
said. “Even if he was a rotten 
writer — ” 

Canute had never heard of the 
man. 

“You just gave him a nice epi- 
taph,” he told the nurse. “Better 
that than the other way around.” 

April, Year Thirty-five 

B USIRIS, Illinois, had a popu- 
lation of 100,000. Its youngest 
citizen was thirty-five years old, 
its oldest, 101. The death rate was 
accelerating .as the median age 
rose. Materially man had “never 
had it so good,” Lister’s successor 
kept telling the U.S.N.A. This was 
true — yet the suicide rate, once 
stabilized, had again started to 
inch upward. Use of liquor and 
marihuana was on the rise — more 
and more citizens seemed to be 
commited to slow self-destruction. 
The HSGs — hypersexogenics — 
were making superstuds and super- 
mares of the older citizens. They 
sometimes suffered unfortunate 
side-effects — heart failures or 
strokes. The Government had 
tried, not too vigorously, to take 
the HSGs off the market, but the 
resulting storm of protest forced 
the authorities to make them 



available again. Some citizens 
claimed that the Government did 
not really care — that it would just 
as soon kill off its older citizens as 
quickly as possible — but few paid 
any attention to this cynical 
reasoning. 

Canute was sixty-three and feel- 
ing, at times, the old wounds from 
the South Side Park shooting. He 
still held the CONES chairman- 
ship but had turned over most of 
his duties to younger members. 
Maria had died three years ago, 
possibly because of a dose of HSG 
she had taken, though the coroner 
said that this could not be proven. 
Canute had married Amanda Til- 
keson after a decent interval. 

Today he and Amanda were on 
a fishing trip. They had left home 
before dawn. He still lived in the 
mansion on High View Drive, 
though the place was becoming 
more of a problem than a pleasure. 
He was forced to do most of the 
painting, repairing, plumbing, 
wiring and so forth himself. The 
professional plumbers, electricians 
and painters were too few and too 
prone to go off on extended vaca- 
tions. Their services could seldom 
be obtained. Canute had attended 
a home-owner’s training school and 
had learned just about everything 
he needed to know to maintain a 
house — even so he had sealed off 
most of the mansion. He and 



138 



GALAXY 



Amanda contented themselves 

with about six rooms. 

They drove before sunrise along 
the top of the bluff overlooking 
miles of the moonlit Illinois River, 
then descended. At the foot of the 
bluffs they cut across an area that 
had once been crowded with the 
modest homes of workers of the 
Earthmover Diesel Company. 

These were now gone — a young 
forest rose in their place. Canute 
took the river road to the Ivory 
Club, the members of which still 
kept their exclusiveness. He and 
Amanda set out on the river in his 
comfortable, steam-driven four- 
sleeper — they anchored on the 
other side of the river, away from 
all signs of civilization, and 
watched the sun come up over the 
hills. 

The river was different from what 
it had been during mornings Ca- 
nute remembered from his boy- 
hood. The water was pure. He 
could look down into it for many 
feet and see the fish as the sun rose 
higher. 

The stock was as it had been 
when the white man had first come 
here — he saw large river trout, 
pike and catfish. 

He set out his lures and sat look- 
ing across the river, west and south, 
where the downtown section of 
Busiris had been — rather, still 
was. The city hall and jail, the 



Federal, state and city official 
buildings were there, but they were 
only two stories high and hidden 
by the tall trees. The high buildings 
— the old courthouse, the Busiris 
Life Insurance building, the 
Champlain Hotel, the Earthmover 
Diesel Building — had all been torn 
down. To go downtown was to go 
into another park. 

“You know, Amanda,” he said 
softly, “there are still people who 
curse Clabb. But he saved the 
world — he really did. If things had 
gone on as they were, with the 
expanding population and increas- 
ing pollution and breakdown of 
the economic and educational 
systems, mankind would have 
reverted to savagery. Some day, 
maybe, a statue will be erected to 
Clabb and he’ll take his proper 
place in the history books.” 

“I wonder whatever happened 
to him,” she said. 

“He’d be eighty-six years old 
now, so he may be dead. But if he 
isn’t he ought to know that he 
stands a chance of being ranked 
among the greatest — if not the 
greatest — at least by some people. 
With Lister next.” 

“I still don’t like his having de- 
prived me of having more children.” 
“Look at it this way,” Canute 
argued. “He saved you the possi- 
bility of heartbreaks, of bitterness, 
of disappointment.” 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



139 



“My children would have loved 
me, taken care of me in my old 
age,” she said. 

“Don’t get mad,” he said. “But 
your children and you would prob- 
ably have perished years ago. Or, if 
you had survived you’d be living 
in some stacked slum or wandering 
the Earth, looking for a chance to 
breathe. And you wouldn’t have 
gotten any geriatric care, either. 
You’d be an arthritic, mostly 
toothless old woman instead of the 
beautiful and healthy, almost 
girlish woman you are.” 

Jackson knew by now how to 
make a wife happy. 

On the way home he and Amanda 
passed a demolition rig taking 
down the old Williams mansion, 
which had been built a hundred 
and ten years ago. Dr. Williams 
and his wife had died within a few 
days of each other. The rig con- 
sisted of several big machines and 
one man who controlled every- 
thing through the console in his 
vehicle. He sat there, watching the 
machines work together. 

April, Year Seventy 

O F THE four billion Earth pop- 
ulation alive seventy years 
ago, 500 million remained. Several 
million might still be alive in an- 
other thirty years. In another 



thirty-five years, perhaps a dozen 
or so. 

There were thirteen million who 
had not been alive when Clabb 
published his letter. The children of 
the fertiles had been having arti- 
ficially induced twins, triplets and 
even quintuplets during the past 
twenty years, but this custom was 
tapering off. Why fill the world 
again faster than Nature desired? 

Busiris had a population of 
35,000, none of whom was under 
seventy years old. The town was 
being phased out and it was proba- 
ble that it would have a zero 
number of citizenry in five years 
or less. More and more were 
needing hospital care and the 
“younger” ones just were not up 
to taking care of the older, even 
with the cybernated facilities 
available. Even computers — some 
said especially computers — broke 
down. Their electromechanical eyes 
and hands and feet failed and 
technicians and engineers were 
needed to repair them. There were 
few of these left in Busiris and 
outsiders were being brought in 
with increasing frequency to at- 
tend to emergencies. 

The helpless aged were being 
moved to Chicago, where the Gov- 
ernment — the youngest in the 
nation’s history — had built a hos- 
pital-metropolis, already planned 
for obsolescence. In about fifteen 



140 



GALAXY 



years the hospital city itself would 
be a ghost town and exactly what 
was to be done with the superan- 
nuated phantoms roaming its 
corridors had not yet been decided. 
Probably the nonagenarians would 
be moved again, this time to 
Indianapolis. Illinois would then 
be even emptier of man than it 
had been when the pre-Columbians 
lived there. The roads were still 
being maintained by cybers tended 
by a small staff of septuagenarians 
under middle-aged supervisors— 
children of the fertiles and them- 
selves fertile. 

Canute, ninety-eight years old, 
sat in a cybernetic chair and 
watched TV through organ-bank 
eyes he had been given twenty 
years before. His hearing organs, 
his heart, many miles of veins and 
arteries, were plastic. His brain 
and circulatory system had been 
subjected for three years to a chem- 
ical that broke up and helped flush 
out the fatty deposits. Despite all 
these biological auxiliaries Canute 
felt that he was going to die any 
minute now. Something, some- 
where in his body, had broken. 

The President of the U.S.N.A. 
was speaking. He was only thirty 
years old. His face and head were 
cleanshaven, the style of the last 
twenty years for young men. He 
wore a black velvetone sleeveless 
shirt piped with gold and a knee- 



length canary-yellow kilt with 
embroidered red, white and blue 
chevrons and that was all. And he 
was — yes, he was proposing that 
the U.S.N.A. join the World 
Federation. 

The concept of the World Fed- 
eration had first been voiced by 
the premier of the SIND (Swedish, 
Icelandic, Norwegian, Danish) 
Union. The proposal, now endorsed 
by President Windom, was that 
within the next twenty years, since 
most of the pre-Clabbians would 
soon be dead, the post-Clabbians 
of the entire world migrate to a 
megalopolis to be built near Nice, 
France. Its citizens would have 
one nationality — Terran — and the 
language would be Loglan IV, the 
ancestor of the synthetic world 
language created in the middle 
twentieth century. From this 
megalopolis, to be named Terra 
City, the World Federation would 
expand outward and there would 
never again be more than one 
nation. New provinces would be 
created, but they would be part of 
the Commonwealth. 

The surviving old people of all 
nations would be transported to 
a geriatric complex in Terra City 
as soon as facilities permitted. 

President Windom did not stress 
this last — he did not wish to arouse 
the prejudices of the old citizens 
while they were still relatively 



SEVENTY YEARS OF DECPOP 



141 



numerous. One thing was obvious 
— the citizens of Terra City would 
be getting rid of the racial prob- 
lem forever. It had, of course, al- 
ready vanished to large extent 
— the fertiles had been encouraged 
to interbreed freely and their 
children had upped the tempo. 

Windom himself would once 
have been called a black who was 
married to a white woman. Now 
few people used such terms. The 
World Federation planners en- 
visioned a single race of Man, 
whose ancestors were of all the 
races. 

Except the Amerinds of Canada, 
Canute thought, who would prob- 
ably refuse to enter Terra City. 
And generations hence, when 
Europe, Africa, Asia, South Amer- 
ica and Australia had been reoc- 
cupied by the expanding human 
race — what about North America? 
Once again it would be the property 
of the red man. What then? Would 
a highly civilized, highly cyber- 
nated society of the Terrans face a 
barbaric sylvan society of the 
Amerinds? War? Conquest again? 
Or would man by then have learned 
his lesson? 

Was it a good sign that the 
youth of all the nations seemed so 
alien to its still surviving ancestors? 
The phenomenon was not unprece- 
dented, though the generation gap, 
the communication gap, had never 



been so wide. Pre-Clabb and post- 
Clabb simply did not understand 
each other. 

The national Government had ; 
long since been taken over by the 
post-Clabb people and President 
Windom’s generation had stretched ; 
the gap further. All extra-Nova ' 
City citizens had been disenfran- 
chised. They could elect state and 
local officials, but the Federal 
Government was forever out of I 
their control. 

Windom had declared four years 1 
ago that the old people no longer j 
understood the young ones who : 
had been raised and educated in | 
Nova City. Disenfranchisement S 
had followed. Many angry oldsters ' 
had raged about revolution, but the ; 
structure of their highly cybernated , 
economy of abundance put them at ■ 
the mercy of the central authority. 
Pressure on a button would cut off > 
electric power anywhere in the 
nation. And nothing electrome- 
chanical would move. Besides, the 
oldsters had no weapons and were, 
to put it plainly, too old to act ; 
anyway. ' 

The Nova Citizens and their 
counterparts the world over were 
said to be almost entirely free of 
mental illnessess and neuroses. 
They acted on a rational basis, 
were free of superstition and pre- ; 
judice and had even rid themselves 
of the sexual jealousies that man

had always prized as an integral 
part of his morality. Their society 
stressed total personal freedom 
among its members to cooperate 
in the enrichment of human ex- 
perience and progress— whatever 
these meant. 

Canute sat and half-dozed, dimly 
aware that the President had long 
ago quit speaking and that a com- 
edy show and a documentary had 
followed and another of the many 
nostalgia programs was beginning. 
This one, it happened, was set in 
the year 1990. 

Canute took a stimulator tablet 
and sat up to watch it. The nostal- 
gia shows were more funny than 
the comedy shows. The year 1990, 
as Canute remembered it, was not 
something to get mushy or even 
slightly regretful about. 

Two minutes passed and he was 
just beginning to chuckle at the 
commentary when suddenly the 
show was cut off. 

Canute sat up still straighter. 
His heart began to hammer as he 
heard the news announcement. 
President Windom had just been 
shot and killed. The assassin had 
then killed himself. He had been 
a member of the President’s inner 
circle of friends, though lately they 
had been known to have disagreed 
on certain policies and particularly 
on Presidential appointments. The 
assassin’s wife had recently ac- 



cepted — against her husband’s 
wishes — a confidential White 
House post. 

Canute settled down in his chair 
and laughed a little shrilly. His 
faith in the instability and corrupti- 
bility of human nature had been 
restored. There would be no super- 
men, no utopia. There would con- 
tinue to be need for men like 
himself, unflappable, adaptable 
— men who could make a non- 
utopian society work simply by 
selfishly doing their jobs. 

Not a thing wrong with a little 
selfishness, as he had once pointed 
out to Maria? Clabb had unselfishly 
destroyed a generation — and prob- 
ably himself. Lister had selfishly 
teamed up with men like Jackson 
Canute to save what was left. 
Windom’s assassination had been 
an equally unselfish act — it had 
destroyed the assassin. Somewhere 
a man was waiting to save himself 
— and quite incidentally his fellows 
— from this latest disaster. 

Jackson closed his eyes. It gave 
him, the always rational man, 
satisfaction to know that mankind 
remained as capable of madness 
as ever. 

Other men’s madness gave sanity 
a chance. 

Jackson Canute suddenly felt 
both human and invincible. Play 
it cool, he told himself, and per- 
haps even when death comes. ★

r was while they were dressing 
for the party that she looked 
into the mirror and saw death. 
What she experienced was not an 
amorphous foreboding of death but 
rather the knowledge of it as a 
clinical certainty — it could come 
tomorrow or the next day or per- 
haps the next year. But death was 
suddenly sure and irrevocable, 
measured out in days and months 
rather than in the decades she had 
once expected as a matter of 
course. 

When you are young, she 
thought, death is an infinite dis- 
tance away . 

Death existed for the young only 









144 



in the sudden violent end, the 
brutal bewildering accident that 
stopped the heart suddenly, that 
stilled the fever of the limbs in an 
instant. She herself had never 
thought of death until two years 
ago when she had been in Sweden 
to deliver the Nobel lecture and had 
nearly lost her life in a street ac- 
cident. During the long convales- 
cence she had become oppressed 
with the idea of dying. 

And now — For me death is as 
inevitable as tomorrow's sunrise. 

And perhaps as close. 

He came out of the sonic shower, 
a tanned mass of flesh — now bright 
red from the sonic-water blast — 
and muscles, hard and beautifully 
muted by the thin layering of 
firm fat that a man of thirty 
developed. His voice was booming. 

“Come on, Ellen, why the funk?” 

She looked into the mirror, noting 
that her hair was of a too even 
chemical color, that the flesh was 
sagging around her eyes and that 
her cheeks were melting in folds 
of tissue that would tighten only 
for a few hours after she used her 
creams and emollients. She was 
showing the first sign of jowls, she 
saw. The flaccid tissue of her face 
was suspended by the ligaments 
but flowed down over the jawline, 
destroying its definition. 

“No funk,” she said. “Just 
thinking.” 



“You scientists think too much,” 
he said heartily, toweling his head 
vigorously and then rubbing his 
massive chest. The coarse black 
hair between his nipples sprang 
erect as the towel took its mois- 
ture. He rubbed his flanks and his 
hard indented buttocks. 

He was, she decided, quite 
beautiful, beautiful in a full 
masculine way that still brought a 
catch to her breath. Everything 
about him excited her — the 
muscled belly with its clear defini- 
tion, the deeply indented pubic fold, 
his maleness, darker in tone than 
the rest of the body, but pure and 
unmottled, springing in easy 
authority from a patch of the same 
bristly black hair that washed 
darkness across his chest. 

“I know you,” he said, putting 
his arm around her bare shoulders 
and wrinkling her shift in his 
rough grasp. “I know you too 
well, Flowergirl.” 

She winced at the pet name. In 
the five years they had been to- 
gether, she had grown to love the 
caress in his voice when he called 
her by it. Tonight the phrase was 
bitter with irony. 

“Flowergirl?” she questioned. 
“Rather, Evening Primrose.” 
“Morning Glory,” he countered, 
laughing. He swept her up in his 
arms and bore her back into the 
bedroom.

“Frank, we’re late.’’ 

“Damn the party,’’ he said. “It’s 
for us — for you. For the great Dr. 
Ellen Marsden. They’ll wait on 
our own good time.’’ 

They were on the bed and he was 
doing things that brought a fear 
and an excitement to her. The 
banked fires of her aging body 
glowed, the fluids of her limbs 
became turgid with excitement 
and she looked up into his glowing 
eyes, knowing the heat of his body, 
the massive muscularity of his 
chest. Her feelings toward him built 
to a crescendo — she was buoyed 
upward in an incredible fantasy 
of male odor, male strength, male 
tenderness. At one climactic instant 
she looked up and saw that un- 
believable blending of lust and love 
in his eyes and the world exploded 
in flames. Her brain turned into a 
core of light that flared and sub- 
sided into lassitude and complete 
fulfillment. 

“There,” he said at last, breath- 
ing heavily. “I’ve been wanting to 
do that all day.” 

“You’ve messed my hair,” she 
complained, feeling playful and for 
some reason a little cross. 

“Much more,” he said, rubbing 
the hair away from her temples. 

She felt as if she had been vio- 
lently possessed and the feeling was 
one of wonder and complete satis- 
faction as always. 



“You shouldn’t do this sort of 
thing,” she said, trying to sound 
very prim. 

“You wouldn’t want it any 
other way,” he accused. 

“No,” she admitted. “You’re 
perfectly right.” 

They finished dressing and he 
fixed her rumpled hair with his 
big facile hands, completely un- 
concerned with the problem of hid- 
ing the thinning in the crown, the 
faint scars of the accident, all the 
ancient signs of attack on the aging 
organism. 

<<"^7^0U’RE quite remark- 
X able,” she told him as she 
adjusted her stole. 

“So are you,” he said. Then: 
“But it’s much the same thing, 
isn’t it?” 

“Yes,” she said softly. “Yes, 
it is.” 

The party was downtown and 
instead of taking the tube they 
chose a ground-effects cab and rode 
silently in the back seat. She was 
ever conscious of his banked 
energies, the slow beat of his mas- 
sive heart beside her, the surging 
energy of his muscles, and sud- 
denly she felt slight, weak, un- 
equal to the Joyous life that 
animated his limbs. Argon lights 
flickered past, reflected in the 
slick of rain that the weather sta- 



146 



GALAXY 



tions had scheduled for that even- 
ing. The air was already hot and 
muggy with the rising temperature 
and humidity, but the first of the 
programed breezes were beginning 
to dispell the miasma. She touched 
her hair several times, hoping that 
the humidity would not play its 
usual tricks and dissolve her hair- 
do into a mass of frizzes and un- 
controlled waves. 

The ground-effect fan under the 
cab sighed and the remaining 
moisture on the pavement outside 
rippled under the air blast. He put 
his arm around her and kissed her 
softly behind the ear. Her heart 
surged with sudden joy and she 
nestled against him until her right 
hand accidently touched the 
underflesh of her left arm. The 
flesh was cold and had a tissue- 
thin quality that frightened her. 
Her hands, she saw in the passing 
lights, were still good. There was a 
suggestion of blue veining, a 
touch too much bone and sinew, 
but the color was good. He had 
found the preparation that 
bleached the liver spots that had 
depressed her and had — charac- 
teristically — left it on top of the 
water closet, lid off, as though he 
himself had been using it. He had 
found this easy diplomatic way of 
meeting the problem, just as he 
had found ways of showing her 
how to use makeup to disguise 



the first wrinkling, tint to fade 
away the gray without giving her 
hair a grotesque look. 

She shook her head, wondering 
if another man like him walked on 
the face of the Earth. 

He helped her to the curb and 
paid the driver, counting the 
plastic chits. The doorman opened 
the door and in seconds the tube 
whisked them to the fifteenth floor 
where sounds of people laughing 
permeated the corridor. The door 
of the apartment at the far end of 
the corridor was open and she 
could hear the sound of a multifi, 
beating out the dissonant rhythms 
of the latest mauve beat. The 
music ended in mid-phrase and, 
after a second of mechanical inde- 
cision, began again. Eleanor 
Rigby, she realized with quick 
nostalgia. By the original Beatles. 
A flood of memories engulfed her 
for an instant. Was this the com- 
mon denominator of age, that the 
most casual sounds from the past 
would plunge one into this mood of 
bitter-sweet nostalgia? 

Where were the Beatles now, 
she wondered? She remembered 
the story of John Lennon and 
his lovely Japanese wife — what had 
been her name? No matter. It was 
all a part of the past that she 
would never revisit. Better the 
now. Only the now. 

She squeezed his arm posses- 



WOMAN’S RIB

sively. Only the now and forget the 
tomorrow. Tomorrow would 
come soon enough. 

“Ellen,” Betty Margriet said at 
the door. “Frank, we thought you 
would never come.” 

“My fault,” Frank said. “I’m 
a bum about dressing.” 

“Frank, you beautiful thing,” 
Betty said, “you could never be a 
bum.” She pulled them into the 
room and conveyed them like a 
small busy tug escorting great 
ships through the harbor. 

“Lance, you’ve met Ellen and 
Frank? George, this is Ellen 
Marsden and her beautiful 
Frank—” 

“Dr. Marsden, how good to 
meet you. I’ve been looking — ” 
“Come along, Ellen, there’s a 
fabulous man 1 want you to meet 
and — Frank, Frank, what’s your 
secret? You don’t ever seem to — ” 

T alk, talk, talk. The chatter 
quite overwhelmed Ellen. 
Frank was smiling beside her, 
saying just the right thing, always 
self-contained, still bright and 
spirited while she felt the first 
fatigue invade her body. On the far 
side of the room she saw Vaslov 
with whom she had had the terrible 
argument over nucleoproteins at 
the seminar the week before. No 
matter. Professional and personal 
conflicts were of a different order. 



And Goldschmidt, with his 
huge Roman nose and gentle eyes, 
was waving at her from a solid 
group, his delicate artist’s hands 
clutching what appeared to be a 
martini. She knew that it was only 
a glass of water with an olive, an 
innocent deception. Flanking him 
were two fat men she had never 
seen — facing him a thin wispy girt j 
of perhaps twenty-eight and a man ' 
in black. As the black-clad man 
turned Ellen recognized Dr. 
Melton of the Theological School. * 
She raised her eyes in surprise. To ■ 
see him at a party was unusual. 

Then they were in tow again, she j 
and Frank, with Betty still gushing, 4 
ever ready to show off her dis- J 
tinguished guest. Finally Betty | 
left them alone and Ellen sighed i 
and said, “My God, that was a | 
chore.” -I 

Frank laughed. “The penalty 1 
of greatness.” I 

“Greatness is a term loosely used M 
nowadays.” | 

“Well, fame then,” he said. She | 
patted his arm. _ 1 

Goldschmidt came over and j 
said, “My dear Ellen, how lovely 
you look.” His poet’s eyes with 
long almost feminine lashes said, ; 
I mean it — you are beautiful. “And 
Frank, it is good to see you.” 

“I’m delighted to see you too, 
Aaron.” 

“Your seminar the other day 



148 



GALAXY 



still has me muttering in my 
beard,” Goldschmidt told Ellen. 

“That was the idea,” Ellen said. 
“The concepts themselves aren’t 
new.” 

“Just looking at the other side 
of the coin — but what a difference 
in insight that can make.” 

“You two can talk shop five days 
a week,” Frank said. “Tonight I 
refuse to allow you to ignore me.” 
“Of course.” Goldschmidt 
laughed and bowed. “I am being 
rude.” 

“Not at all, Aaron,” Frank said. 
“As though there were a time when 
you could offend me.” 

Goldschmidt grabbed both of 
them by the arm and propelled 
them forward, his eyes alive with 
excitement. “What a gift God has 
given me,” he said, “to have two 
such friends as you. Now, come 
there are some lovely people I want 
you to meet.” 

T hey walked across the room, 
winding their way through a 
group of dancers who had begun 
one of the intricately figured Rack 
numbers. She considered idly how 
similar they were to the round 
dances of her grandmother’s 
youth. Similar and yet different 
with couples separated, distant, 
aesthetically alienated. The prob- 
lem of the age was — she held her- 
self close to Frank — that people. 



even people in love, lived out their 
lives in a special no-contact isola- 
tion. She glanced at Frank and 
thought. Never mind why this is 
special. I would do it again. I have 
what is important. I have a being 
who is a part of me with no walls, 
no barriers, nothing between us 
that would intrude. For you I 
would give everything. For your 
happiness I would sacrifice 
everything . 

She caught herself, realizing 
that she was becoming maudlin. 
She usually didn’t give into such 
intense emotions. Yet her thought 
had been an expression of truth. 
And she realized that only she 
knew the depths of that truth. 

She and perhaps Goldschmidt, 
who could not help but be a part 
of it. 

Dear Aaron, she thought. Dear 
friend, dear. .something else? 
Well, no matter. He knew the 
limitations and he was willing to 
accept them. Which was the 
tragedy and the glory and the bit- 
terness of what they had done 
together. 

Goldschmidt said, “This lovely 
young thing is Celia Harris.” The 
wispy girl smiled uncertainly. Her 
eyes, big and colored like a fawn’s, 
were frightened. Ellen felt a sud- 
den identification with the girl. 

The perennial wallflower — my 
dear, how well / know you . 



WOMAN’S RIB

“And Dr. Melton,” Goldschmidt 
was saying. “You know Dr. 
Melton, Ellen?” 

“Yes,” Ellen said deliberately. 
“I’m afraid Dr. Melton doesn’t 
approve of me.” 

“I have no idea where you got 
that misconception,” Melton said, 
coloring. 

“When one faculty member at- 
tacks the philosophy of another’s 
work,” Ellen said, “the whole uni- 
versity knows about it in a day.” 

“I have apparently been mis- 
quoted,” Melton said, blushing 
more deeply. 

“Wonderful,” Goldschmidt said. 
“We have the start of a stimulating 
discussion to enliven an otherwise 
dull evening.” 

“Oh, really?” Celia Harris 
asked and then looked startled. 

“I’m sorry, my dear,” Gold- 
schmidt said. “It’s just that we 
oldsters are more in love with 
ideas than with people.” 

“This whole dabbling with the 
very substance of life bothers me,” 
Dr. Melton said. 

“1 would suppose so,” Ellen said. 

“He is concerned with God’s 
preogatives.” Goldschmidt’s eyes 
were mischievous. 

“Not at all,” Melton said 
ponderously. 

“But of course,” Goldschmidt 
insisted. 

The background music changed. 



“My God,” Frank said, “they’re 
actually playing a waltz.” 

“How nice,” Celia Harris said. 

“Frank,” Ellen said, looking 
at the wispy girl and remembering 
long ago. “Frank, why don’t you 
ask Miss Harris to dance.” 

“Oh, I couldn’t — ’ she began. 

“Of course, you could.” Frank’s 
bull heartiness cut across the con- 
versation. 

How beautiful she is, Ellen 
thought. How beautiful and how 
frightened. 

“Thank you,” Celia Harris said 
as she and Frank drifted away. 

<<TS THAT what you want?” 
JL Goldschmidt asked sotto 
voce. 

“It is what 1 want,” Ellen said 
fiercely. 

“You see, you make a funda- 
mental error in your work,” Dr. 
Melton persisted. “An error almost 
traditional, certainly classical.” 

“1 don’t follow you.” 

“Molecular biology is a half- 
century old,” Melton said. “Who 
knows when you will take the 
ultimate step?” 

“The ultimate step?” Gold- 
schmidt grinned. “What, dear sir, 
is the ultimate step? Indeed, is 
there an ultimate step?” 

“You work with the molecules 
of memory, of personality,” 
Melton said. “You have defined 



150 



GALAXY 



all the biochemical processes es- 
sential to a self-perpertuating 
system — to life, if you prefer. 
You’ve learned to generate a 
complete organism from a few 
random specialized cells and 
you’ve even reached the point of 
building new organisms over 
structures of plastic and metal by 
this technique.” 

“Of course,” Goldschmidt said. 
“The cloning technique began in 
the early seventies. You know, 
growing whole frogs from just a 
few cells of frog intestine.” 
“Eventually,” Melton said, 
“you must try to duplicate human 
life — or improve it.” 

“Now he has said it.” Gold- 
schmidt chuckled. 

“What makes you think so?” 
Ellen demanded. 

“The nature of the beast,” 
Melton said. “1 dread the result.” 
“That’s too common an emo- 
tion,” Goldschmidt said. “Almost 
a racial phenomenon — as ex- 
pressed in that abomination by 
Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley.” 
“Oh, that?” Melton said. “I’m 
sure you’re more subtle and adept 
than Mrs. Shelley’s poor creator. 
Nevertheless, the heresy — ” 

“A good Anglican talking about 
heresy?” someone asked. 

“The word is hard for an Angli- 
can to use,” Melton admitted. 
“Nevertheless, Catholic dogma 



has many beautifully defined moral 
paradoxes. Some of the best minds 
of the last five centuries have con- 
tributed to Church thinking.” 

“The heresy you mentioned?” 
Goldschmidt prompted. 

“The heresy of Valentinius the 
Gnostic,” Melton said. “Basically, 
the idea that the created being 
suffers from the imperfections 
built into him by an imperfect 
creator.” 

“Beautiful.” Goldschmidt was 
still amused. “Quite beautiful. Of 
course. I’ve heard of this. It’s a 
lovely linear proposition. However, 
we have seen that logical linearity 
is not necessarily — ” 

“Spare me, Aaron,” Melton said. 
“You know how we — ” 

“That was lovely,” Celia Harris 
said, interrupting. She and Frank 
had returned and her fawn eyes 
were alive. Ellen looked at her and 
knew. 

It always happened. Frank had 
that special wordless communica- 
tion with women — Ellen had never 
seen one who, exposed to it, had 
not instantly and completely fallen 
in love with Frank. It was how she 
had wanted him to be — now, she 
realized, his talent had a special 
value she had not planned. 

“The special significance of the 
heresy,” Melton was saying, “is — ” 
“What heresy?” Frank asked 
and Melton told him. 



WOMAN’S RIB 



151 



“You know—” Frank clapped 
Melton on the shoulder— “you 
beautifully logical people always 
seem to avoid seeing the total con- 
sequences of an idea.” 

“I don’t follow you.” 

“What 1 mean,” Frank said, “is 
that the reverse must be true. That 
the perfections that a created being 
enjoys reflect an equally perfect 
creator.” 

“Rubbish,” Melton said and then 
colored anew. 

“Is it?” Goldschmidt demanded. 
“Or does the creation imply the 
creator?” 

Melton said nothing. 

AFTER that the conversation 
xX degenerated. Frank, at Ellen’s 
silent gesture, asked Celia to dance 
again and Ellen wandered away. 
There was a point, she decided in 
her fatigue, when exercising one’s 
mind became a chore and she felt 
little like thinking at this moment. 
She found a seat on a Kawasaki 
couch and relaxed into a state of 
quiescence. Across the room Frank 
and the girl danced and Ellen 
watched the glowing new emo- 
tion in the girl’s eyes. She knew 
a faint twinge of regret and then a 
sense of pure, overwhelming 
triumph. 

Finally she felt that her face was 
wilting and decided to freshen up. 
She rose tiredly from the couch. 



counting the thousand small pains 
that were the heritage of her aging 
human body, and walked past the 
heavy drapes into the hall. She had 
not intended to be secretive or 
furtive but her movements were 
slow and silent. She came upon two 
women and stopped, not wishing 
to intrude. They were standing, 
smiling and talking, near the mas- 
sive Tokagawa vase with its in- 
credible dragons rampant on gilt 
and ochre. Ellen heard most of the 
conversation before the women 
saw her. 

“Isn’t he a beautiful man?” one 
said. 

The other, short and vulgarly 
pretty, asked, “What does he see 
in her?” 

“God knows,” the first one said. 
Her thin lips twisted. “She’s plain 
enough. 1 imagine she always was, 
even when she was young. Who 
knows what motivates men?” 

“I wish I knew what motivated 
that one,” the short woman said. 

“He seems to be very motivated 
at the moment.” 

“Yes.” The short one wet her 
lips. “If 1 were Dr. Marsden I’d 
watch my young Greek god very 
closely.” 

“She’s such a frump. How does 
she hold on to him?” 

“Who knows? I first saw him five 
years ago when she suddenly 
showed up with him and he’s been 



152 



GALAXY 



like a shadow to her ever since.” 
“No accounting for bad taste — ” 
“Pardon me.” Ellen spoke too 
loudly, pushing past them. There 
was a certain amount of bitchiness 
in her tone, she realized, and both 
women looked alarmed and then 
satisfied. 

How we tear each other's hearts 
out, Ellen thought sadly as she 
opened the door to the restroom. 

Later she found Frank and 
Aaron talking quietly and said, 
“I’m very tired.” 

“Of course,” Frank said, ever 
solicitous. “Would you like to go?” 
“Tomorrow,” Goldschmidt said. 
“I’ll certainly see you tomorrow.” 
“1 suppose so,” she said. 

He reached out to touch her arm 
tenderly. “Ellen, you tire too easily 
these days. You must take good 
care of yourself.” 

“Thank you, Aaron. You were 
always a good friend.” 

“And more.” 

“I wish it could have been.” 

“No matter,” he said. “I have 
done everything 1 could. You and 
Frank — ” He spread his hands 
eloquently. “You know, Frank is 
like a son to me.” 

“Rather a brother,” Frank said 
seriously. 

“And, alas — a rival.” 

“Thank you,” Ellen said tiredly. 
“Do take care of yourself,” he 
said again. 



S HE left the party with Frank 
and thought of how Aaron had 
stood beside her, sustained her, 
encouraged her. She had not meant 
matters to turn out as they had, but 
she and Aaron had been so much 
more successful than they had 
dreamed they would be. And 
finally he had protected her and 
her special knowledge, knowing 
that he was robbing himself of 
what he wanted most. 

For it would not have done for 
them to publish this triumphant 
breakthrough, not after what had 
happened. Poor little wallflower 
who had devoted herself to 
thought and science and knowledge 
and longed for love. Only Aaron 
knew the full flowering of her de- 
sire, the months of work and hope 
that had finally created the one 
thing that had given her life mean- 
ing. Aaron could never have met 
her need — for she would not com- 
promise — but like a good friend he 
had helped and given that special 
part of himself. The success she 
had found, the triumph, were 
equally his. 

In the taxi Frank said, “You 
seem lost.” 

“I was thinking of Aaron.” 

“He loves you, you know,” 
Frank said. 

“I know,” she said. “1 wish it 
had worked the other way.” 

“He doesn’t expect the situation 



WOMAN’S RIB 



153 



to change,” Frank said. “That 
doesn’t alter the fact that there is 
nothing he would not do for you.” 
“I know that too well,” she said 
sadly. 

At home they disrobed and she 
sat brushing her hair, seeing the 
faint tinge of gray under the dye. 
She would wither and age, she 
knew, in the coming months. It was 
only a matter of time before the 
feral thing tearing at her vitals 
would destroy her. And Frank? 
What would happen to Frank, who 
had come into her life a bare five 
years before? 

Frank, who was maleness and 
youth and naivete and would go 
on for years, perhaps centuries, be- 
cause she had wanted it that way. 

He came to her and put his arms 
around her. “You know I will al- 
ways love you.” 

“I know,” she said. “After all, 1 
planned it that way. Aaron and 1 
— we made it so.” 

He laughed. “Do you think this 
bothers me?” 

“It should,” she said. 

“I would have wanted to love 
you, regardless.” 

“Would you?” 

“The created being reflects the 
faults and the virtues of the 
creator,” he said. “Remember?” 

“I find that hard to believe.” 
“It’s true,” he said, his arms en- 
folding her. 



“You know this can’t last much 
longer.” 

“I’ve known that for quite some 
time.” 

“What will you do then?” 

“Whatever you wish.” 

“That girl tonight — ” 

“Celia?” 

“Yes. She’s so much as I used 
to be. Lonely and unloved and un- 
certain.” 

“She’s quite beautiful — as you 
are.” 

“Oh,” she said, “how I envy her. 
You know it’s only a matter of time 
before I—” She paused, not finish- 
ing the sentence, testing his under- 
standing one last time. 

He grasped her meaning in- 
stantly, perfectly as always. 

“Is that what you want?” he 
asked. “For someone like you to 
take your place?” 

“Yes,” she said. “1 think she 
needs you very much — as I needed 
you. 1 think she would be quite 
wonderful for you, too.” 

“I hoped you would say that,” 
he said, kissing her. 

“You’re so much more than 1 in- 
tended,” she said, melting into his 
great arms. 

“I could only be what you wished 
me to be,” he said, kissing her 
again. 

She felt his body close to her and 
his arms were gentle. Gentle, but 
like steel. ★

AUBERSON was walking down 
xX the flourescent-pale hallway 
to his office when he saw the flash 
and bob of her red hair. She saw 
him at the same time and smiled, 
waved and quickened her step. He 
could think of no way to avoid her. 
“Hi, what’s up?” 

“I should be asking you. Where 
have you been all week?” 



“Busy,” he said. 

“Obviously. 1 just came from 
your office. It looks a mess. Sylvia 
says you haven’t stopped running 
since Monday.” 

“That’s only two days.” He 
smiled. “Though it does seem a lot 
longer.” 

• “Have you had lunch?” she 
asked. 

He shook his head. 

“Well, then — come on.” He

tried to protest, but she took his 
arm and turned him around, say- 
ing, “It’s on me. I’ll put it on my 
expense account. It’s all part of my 
campaign to keep a scientist from 
starving.” 

He smiled again and allowed 
himself to be led down the hall. 
“Your card was nice. I was going 
to send you one, but I haven’t had 
a chance to go looking.” 

“So why not telephone? Call 
me collect if you want. Any time.” 
He was embarrassed. “Uh, I 
haven’t had the chance.” 

They decided to avoid the com- 
pany cafeteria and go to a quiet 
place in town instead. They paused 
at the plant gate long enough for 
Auberson to buzz his office and tell 
his secretary that he would be gone 
for at least an hour and a half. 
While she was waiting, Stel low- 
ered the convertible top and 
pulled a pale blue scarf from his 
glove compartment. She had put it 
there for precisely this type of oc- 
casion. She was trying it on when 
David came back. 

As he got into the car she said, 
“I’m going to have to put a couple 
more of these things in here — this 
blue doesn’t go at all well with this 
dress.” 

He laughed, managing a genial, 
good-natured sound, he thought. 
He put the car into gear. “Where 
are we going?” 



“How about the Tower Room?” 
“Uh-uh. Too many of the wrong 
kind of people.” He paused, then 
added in explanation: “Company 
people.” 

“Okay. If not there, where?” 

He shrugged. “I don’t know. 
Let’s get lost.” 

H e switched on the stereo 
and eased the car into the 
light midday traffic. She looked at 
him. He was a relaxed driver, not 
like so many who hunched tensely 
over the steering wheel. Auberson 
enjoyed driving. The line of his jaw 
tightened momentarily as he con- 
centrated on the traffic ahead. 
With one hand he maneuvered a 
pair of sunglasses out of his coat 
pocket and onto his nose. The wind 
whipped at his hair and his tie. 

The feel of the road changed 
abruptly as they swung into the 
freeway. The tugging fingers of 
the wind grew stronger as Auberson 
gunned the little sports car. She 
waited until he had slid into the far 
left lane before she spoke. 

“What’s wrong with company 
people?” 

“Nothing. I just don’t want to be 
seen by them, that’s all.” The stereo 
mumbled softly to itself, something 
about fixing a hole where the rain 
comes in. He turned it down to a 
whisper and added: “It wouldn’t 



FOR G.O.D.’S SAKE

be a good idea. The two of us to- 
gether, I mean.” 

“You’re afraid people will talk?” 

“I don’t know. There already is 
talk, I guess.” He frowned at a 
momentary lumpiness in the stream 
of traffic. 

As he maneuvered through it 
she turned over in her mind pos- 
sible things to say, at last decided 
to say nothing. It was just as well 
— the moment had passed. 

They were gliding above the 
rooftops of cluttered suburbia — 
black roofs and red, two-car ga- 
rages and stationwagons out in 
front, green pea lawns and a 
cacophony of architectural voices. 
Early-American-Almost-Slum next 
door to Ancient-Gingerbread-With 
-Original-Icing, followed by Plas- 
tic-Cracker-Box and Flagstone- 
Walking-Pseudo-Californian. Ugly 
stucco boxes, white walls stained 
with brown streaks and greasy 
smoke from countless kitchen 
windows. Rust outlined screens on 
the windows of faded apartment 
buildings. Housewives in shorts 
were hanging damp sheets on wire 
lines. Blue-gray mailmen lugged 
heavy brown bags. Children, too 
small to be in school, chased after 
dogs bigger than they were and too 
smart to be caught. Shopping 
centers displayed bright glass win- 
dows filled with wishes and 
temptations. 



The houses drew closer together, 
grew taller, became offices, then 
warehouses, big and featureless 
and ugly. The office buildings 
evolved into concrete-and-glass 
towers. Auberson selected an off- 
ramp into a narrow canyon with 
sunglaring walls. 

H e realized abruptly that 
he was heading toward the 
restaurant where he had taken 
Stel on their first date. Now why 
did I do that? It was too late to 
change his mind, though — he 
swung around a corner and they 
were there. 

She did not mention the choice 
of restaurant — perhaps she ac- 
cepted it as an inevitable spot for 
the two of them. After they had 
ordered, she looked at him 
sharply. 

“What’s the matter, David?” 
“What do you mean?” 

“Nothing, I guess. I just say 
that sometimes.” 

“Oh.” 

She decided to talk about some- 
thing else. “I hear you’ve been hav- 
ing trouble with Harlie again.” 
“No, not with Harlie — because 
of Harlie.” 

“Well, you know what I mean. 
/ know the whole company is in an 
uproar. Something about un- 
authorized specs — I haven’t had a 
chance to pay too much attention 



158 



GALAXY 



to it. I’ve been troubleshooting the 
annual report for Dome.” 

“Oh? I thought that was 
finished.” 

“It was supposed to be — but the 
statistics keep coming out wrong. 
Actually that means that they 
keep coming out right.” 

“Huh?” 

She hesitated, then made a deci- 
sion. “I guess it wouldn’t hurt to 
tell you. The company keeps two 
sets of books. 

He was startled. “Let’s try that 
again.” 

“Oh, it’s nothing illegal,” she 
hastened to explain. “One set is 
the real books, the other is for 
public consumption — the stock- 
holders mainly.” 

“That sounds illegal to me.” 

She made a face. “It is and it 
isn’t. Let’s just say the second set 
of books is more — cosmetic. It 
looks prettier. The figures haven’t 
been falsified, merely rearranged. 
Those, for instance, pertinent to 
Harlie.” 

“How?” 

“You know and I know that he’s 
a research operation — but some of 
the directors think his cost is too 
large a sum to be listed entirely 
under research. Don’t look at me 
like that, David — I don’t make 
policy and I don’t know why this 
policy was instituted. But appar- 
ently some directors feel it 



wouldn’t look good to the stock- 
holders to see that much money 
being plowed back into the 
business.” 

“Elzer. Carl Elzer,” said Auber- 
son. “He has to be behind this.” 
“With some others.” 

Auberson had been jolted into 
thinking. “The damned looters,” 
he said. 

“How’s that?” 

“You remember how Elzer came 
into the company? He and Dome 
and some of the other directors 
are part of a financial syndicate — 
they specialize in taking over 
companies. They use the assets 
to widen their holdings — ” He 
snapped his fingers. “That’s it — 
their first concern would be to 
prop up the price of the stocks, 
not the health of the company.” 
“You’re starting to lose me.” 
“I’m not sure I follow it all my- 
self.” One thought tumbled out 
after another. “Look, Stellar- 
American Technology and Re- 
search set up four other companies 
to handle various aspects of hyper- 
state electronics. We’re one of 
them. Stellar- American is the 
majority stockholder in each — 
but suppose Stellar-American it- 
self becomes vulnerable to a 
takeover. Get control of it and 
you’ve got five companies in your 
pocket.” 

“But, how—” 



FOR G.O.D.’S SAKE 



159 



“I can think of a couple of ways. 
In order to exploit the hyper-state 
process Stellar may have had to go 
heavily into debt. Let’s say the 
process is harder to develop than 
they thought and expected profits 
don’t materialize — they lose money, 
they borrow more, they go deeper 
into debt, all the time betting that 
they’ll be able to make it back 
because the market is entering an 
inflationary spiral. This is all 
guesswork on my part, but a 
weakness could develop in a situa- 
tion like that — particularly if some 
of the assets the company counted 
on consisted of stock whose price 
had been propped up by juggling 
the books. It could be fooled into 
overextending itself — in which 
case Elzer and company could 
possibly move in.” 

“I thought you were talking 
about a takeover. No company is 
going to risk a controlling amount 
of its stock.” 

“No,” he agreed. “But some 
top men might risk enough to cut 
their share of it down — that is, if 
they were sure that the other major 
stockholders wouldn’t doublecross 
them.” 

“Ugh,” she made a face. “Wait 
a minute — what do 1 know about 
the actual figures? I think about 
thirty-six percent of Stellar-Ameri- 
can Technology stock reached the 
open market.” 



“How do you know that?” 

“The figure was in a report 1 
had to process. In order to get the 
original rights to produce hyper- 
state units, the directors had to 
trade a certain number of shares 
to the man who owns the patents.” 
“Krofft? Dr. Krofft?” 

“I don’t know — if that’s his 
name, then he’s the one. Anyway, 
I know for a fact that the inventor 
owns something like thirteen per- 
cent of Stellar-American voting 
stock.” 

Auberson whistled. “That would 
make him a key piece in the puzzle 
— wonder where he stands. He’s 
director of research over there.” 

T he waitress came with their 
food. As soon as she was gone, 
Stel said, “Okay, let’s assume 
Elzer and Dome have gotten 
Stellar-American — what happens 
now?” 

“Well, actually they’d have five 
companies — Stellar-American and 
the other four: Hyper-State Visual, 
Hyper-State Stereo, Hyper-State 
Modules and Hyper-State Com- 
puter, that’s us. Each of these 
companies has a certain value — 
their assets can be used in several 
ways. I think Elzer is a vampire. 
He doesn’t understand the dif- 
ference between saving a company 
for future potential and milking 
it of its resources now.” 



160 



GALAXY 



“Do you think that’s what he’s 
up to now — milking the company?’’ 
“Could be the reason he’s down 
on Harlie. If he can’t make a lot of 
money fast both Dome and Elzer 
want to discontinue him. I know 
Elzer’s been eyeing his appropria- 
tion for some time. Dome’s attitude 
is a little different — 1 think theirs is 
a marriage of convenience. Elzer 
wants the money; Dome values the 
company — and Harlie could be a 
long-term asset. Apparently Dome 
had the pull in the financial com- 
munity — Elzer has the money, but 
not the position. At the moment, 
Dome is in control — but that could 
change. Harlie’s continued exis- 
tence depends on Dome’s good 
will. If he gets pressured too heavily 
by the rest he may have to throw 
them Harlie in order to protect 
himself. That could be why he’s let 
us continue this long — so he’ll have 
a bone to throw the others if he 
needs one.’’ Auberson looked up 
from his plate. “The annual report 
— what does it say about Harlie?” 
“Not much.” 

“How’s he listed?” 

“That’s just it — he isn’t. He 
should be considered part of the 
research budget, but he doesn’t 
show up there. He doesn’t show up 
anywhere.” 

“Part of the research budget? He 
is the research budget — two-thirds 
of it .anyway.” 



“1 know, but he isn’t listed that 
way. His cost has been spread out, 
listed as ‘Inplant Improvements’ 
and things like that.” 

“Now why the hell — ” He put 
down his knife and fork. “Let’s 
backtrack a little. You said there 
was a problem. The wrong figures 
kept coming out?” 

“No — the right figures did. We 
set up the final drafts of the report 
three weeks ago.” 

“And all the figures were from 
the second set of books? The phony 
ones?” 

She nodded. “But the report 
printed out with all the figures cor- 
rected — taken from the real books. 
At first we thought someone had 
changed it on the copy — you know, 
someone not in on the secret might 
have double-checked the figures 
and changed them — but it wasn’t 
that. Those reports had been fed 
into the typers exactly as we had 
composed them.” 

Something went twang. “The 
typers?” 

“Yes, we have a magtyper com- 
poser — it’s one of the new photo- 
typing units. It was ordered 
especially for handling reports, 
brochures and pamphlets and we’ve 
hooked it into the master system. 
That way we can use any typer in 
the plant for input — you could 
write a letter in your office and get 
a perfectly justified printout — any

type face — off the composer unit. 
Camera-ready copy.” 

“Um,” said Auberson. “1 have a 
feeling that that’s what your prob- 
lem is — the master system. The 
master beast,” he corrected. 

HAT’S what we thought. 

X We’ve been checking the 
computer outlets for two weeks 
now and we can’t find a thing. Yet 
every time we set up a printout we 
get the same darn figures. We’ve 
tried correcting the original tape, 
feeding it in again and I don’t know 
what all. It’s not so much the report 
any more as finding out why it 
keeps coming out wrong — ah — 
right. Well, you know what I mean 
— with the figures we don’t want 
the stockholders to see. Like one of 
the things is Harlie. He’s listed 
right at the top of the research 
budget in the real version —quite 
prominently — and there’s even a 
paragraph explaining his goals and 
objectives. Nobody knows where 
that came from — 1 thought Elzer 
would have a fit when he saw it. If 
we had the new systems analysis 
network completed, it could tell us 
where the trouble is originating — 
but it’s nowhere near operational 
yet, at least not for the master 
beast. We could always send the 
report elsewhere to be printed, but 
that would be personally embar- 



rassing to Dome — the master beast 
is his brainchild.” 

“Mm,” said Auberson and noth- 
ing more. 

“Anyway,” she said. “That’s 
what I’ve been doing for three 
weeks — running like hell and get- 
ting nowhere.” 

“Oh, they’ll probably find the 
trouble soon enough,” said Auber- 
son. “It’ll turn out to be a crossed 
wire or something stupid like that.” 
He sucked in his cheeks and 
glanced at his watch. 

“I hope so,” she said. “We’re 
going to try another run this after- 
noon, just as soon as they finish 
checking the memory tanks again. 
If that doesn’t work. Dome is 
prepared to reschematic the whole 
system.” 

“Is it that serious?” 

“It is to Dome.” 

“Wow — look at the time!” he 
said. “I’d forgotten it was getting 
so late. I should be back at the 
office right now — I’ll have phone 
calls stacked up from one end of the 
country to the other.” 

He stuffed a few last bites into 
his mouth and washed them down 
with coffee. 

Stel was puzzled, but she, too, 
hurried to finish her lunch. He 
signaled the waitress. 

On the drive back she remarked, 
“I didn’t realize how busy you 
were, David — I’m sorry.”

GALAXY 



There was something about the 
way she said it. Briefly he took his 
eyes off the road and glanced at 
her. 

“I just remembered something, 
that’s all. You don’t know what 
I’ve spent the past two days doing, 
do you? Covering for Harlie. I’ve 
been calling every department head 
in four different divisions — ours, 
Los Angeles, Houston and Denver 
— trying to convince each one that 
those specifications we sent them 
are only speculative, that the rea- 
son we sent them out was to get 
their opinion whether or not we 
should consider implementation.” 

“I thought that was the reason 
they were sent out.” 

“It is — but there was no cover 
letter or anything. The way the 
specs were delivered a lot of people 
thought they were file copies of a 
project that was already approved 
and ready to be implemented. They 
thought something had been rail- 
roaded through over their heads 
and they were mad as hell at the 
implied loss of authority. I’ve spent 
two days just picking up the pieces, 
trying to convince some of these 
corporate politicians — ” he spat 
the word in disgust — “that no in- 
sult has been intended, that what 
we’re after is their opinion on the 
matter. The trouble is, they’re all 
so prejudiced against the project 
now because of the way it was de- 



livered that it’s an uphill battle.” 
“I’d heard something about the 
specs appearing suddenly on Mon- 
day morning.” 

“That’s right. Harlie jumped the 
gun and printed them out because 
he figured it was the only way he 
could get anyone to notice them. 
Otherwise he figured he’d be wait- 
ing till the moon fell out of the 
sky.” 

“He’s got a point there. He 
knows the company better than 
you do.” 

“Yes.” Auberson sighed as they 
swung in at the plant gates. “I’m 
afraid he does.

E LEFT her at the main 
entrance and sprinted for his 
office, attracting puzzled glances 
on the way. He ignored Sylvia’s 
urgent bid for his attention and 
locked the door behind him. He 
had the magtyper switched on 
even before he sat down. 

He paused, still panting heavily, 
then typed:

THE RUMOR HAS BEEN CURCULAT-

CONTENT OF THE REPORT. I 
WOULD LIKE TO SPIKE THAT RUMOR 
RIGHT HERE AND NOW. THERE

PORT WILL BE PRODUCED AS IT WAS 
ORIGINALLY INTENDED. IF NOT

NECESSARY, WE WILL DISMANTLE 
EVERY COMPUTER IN THE PLANT 
TO LOCATE THE FAULT. 

THANK YOU, 

Before he could switch off the 
machine, it typed back — seemingly 
of its own accord; right on. 
A WORD TO THE WISE IS 
EFFICIENT. 

AND I HOPE SUFFICIENT, he 

replied, you’re pushing your 

LUCK. IF DORNE DISCOVERS 

you’ve taken over the master 

BEAST you’re DEAD. 

Harlie decided to change the 
subject. WHAT DID YOUR GIRL 
THINK OF MY POEM? 

I didn’t show it to her. 



WHY NOT? didn’t YOU LIKE IT? 

I LIKED IT FINE. IT WAS A VERY 
NICE POEM, HARLIE. YOU’RE GET- 
TING BETTER. BUT I DIDN’T SHOW 
IT TO HER BECAUSE IT DIDN’T 
EXPRESS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED 
IT TO. 

WHAT DID YOU WANT IT TO 
SAY ? 

OH, I don’t know — SOMETHING 
LIKE “I LIKE YOU, TOO.” 

AND MY POEM DIDN’T SAY 
THAT ? 

YOUR POEM SAID, “l LOVE 
YOU.” 

WELL, don’t you LOVE HER ? 
Auberson looked at the type- 
written question for a long time, 
his hands poised over the key- 
board. At last he typed: harlie, 
I REALLY can’t ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION. I don’t KNOW IF I DO 
OR NOT. 

WHY NOT? 

HARLIE, THIS IS A COMPLEX 
SUBJECT. LOVE IS DIFFICULT TO 
UNDERSTAND— it’s EVEN HARDER 
TO EXPLAIN TO SOMEONE WHO 
HAS NEVER BEEN IN LOVE. 

HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN LOVE? 
DO YOU UNDERSTAND IT? 

DO I UNDERSTAND LOVE? 
Auberson typed, then hesitated. 
He wasn’t just echoing Harlie — 
he was asking the question of 
himself, i don’t know, harlie. 
THERE have BEEN SEVERAL TIMES 
WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS IN LOVE, 



164 



GALAXY 



BUT I don’t know if I REALLY 
WAS OR NOT. I HAVE NO WAY OF 
ANALYZING MY FEELING. 

WHY? asked the machine. 

WHY DO I HAVE TO ANALYZE IT? 
OR WHY don’t I KNOW? 

WHY MUST YOU ANALYZE IT? 

AUBERSON thought about that 
x\. one before he typed: that’s 

A LOADED QUESTION, HARLIE. I’VE 
HEARD IT BEFORE FROM PEOPLE 
WHO WANT TO KNOW WHY HUMAN 
EMOTIONS MUST BE DRAGGED INTO 
THE scientist’s LABORATORY. 

AND WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM? 

I TOLD THEM THAT WE NEED 
TO UNDERSTAND EMOTIONS MORE 
THOROUGHLY— SO THAT WE MAY 
LEARN TO CONTROL THEM RATHER 
THAN LET THEM CONTROL US. 

NICELY PUT. DOES THAT APPLY 
TO LOVE, TOO? 

AND that’s the QUESTION 
PEOPLE USUALLY HAVE NEXT. BUT 
I SUSPECT THAT YOUR INTEREST 
IS MORE CLINICAL IN NATURE THAN 
THEIRS. 

HOW DID YOU ANSWER THEM? 
DOES THE DESIRABILITY OF CON- 
TROL ALSO APPLY TO LOVE? 

YES, IT APPLIES TO LOVE. 

YOU WOULD RATHER CONTROL 
LOVE THAN BE CONTROLLED BY 
It? 

IF YOU WANT TO PUT IT THAT 
WAY. BUT I’d rather SAY THAT 
WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND LOVE 



IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO AVOID 
SOME OF ITS PITFALLS AND 
MISUNDERSTANDINGS. 

that’s a euphemism, AUBERSON, 
accused the typer, you’re saying 
the same thing I AM. 

you’re right, he admitted. 
“Goddamn machine,’’ he muttered, 
but with a smile, that brings 

us BACK TO THE CENTRAL 
QUESTION — WHAT IS LOVE? 

you’re ASKING ME? Harlie typed 
back. 

WHY NOT? 

WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT 
I WOULD KNOW? 

YOU CLAIM TO KNOW EVERY- 
THING ELSE. 

that’s a low blow, MAN- 
FRIEND. YOU KNOW THAT MY 
KNOWLEDGE OF THE HUMAN 
EMOTIONS IS LIMITED TO WHAT I 
CAN OBTAIN FROM BOOKS. AND 
WHILE THE BOOKS ARE EXCELLENT 
FOR A THEORETICAL POINT OF 
VIEW, THEY ARE REALLY NO 
SUBSTITUTE FOR IN-THE-FIELD 
EXPERIENCE. 

AND that’s a cop-out, HARLIE. 
YOU HAVE ACCESS TO MORE 
KNOWLEDGE ON ANY ONE SUBJECT 
IN YOUR MEMORY TANKS THAN 
ANY LIVING HUMAN BEING COULD 
POSSIBLY HOPE TO ATTAIN. YOU 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO SYNTHESIZE 
SOME KIND OF TRUTH FROM 
THAT INFORMATION. 

YES, BUT THOSE BOOKS WERE

OBSERVERS, BUT BY SUBJECTIVELY 
ORIENTED HUMAN BEINGS. 

WHO ELSE IS THERE TO WRITE

ME, NOW. BUT ASIDE FROM THAT, 
THE POINT IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS 
ARE IMPERFECT UNITS. THERE IS 
NO GUARANTEE THAT ANY OF 
THAT INFORMATION IS CORRECT. 
THEREFORE, AS IN ALL SYSTEMS 
OF SUBJECTIVELY OBTAINED INFOR- 
MATION (I.E., IN THE CASE OF A 
medium’s BEING USED TO COMMENT 
ON HIS OR HER OWN ACTIVITIES) 
IT MUST BE CAREFULLY WEIGHED 
AGAINST ITSELF. 

I THINK you’re trying TO 
AVOID ANSWERING THE QUESTION. 

I AM NOT. I AM PREFACING MY 
ANSWER. IF YOU DON’T LIKE WHAT 
I TELL YOU, I WILL BE ABLE TO 
FALL BACK ON THIS QUALIFICATION. 

that’s a cop-out, too.

we’ve covered that problem. 

THE QUESTION REMAINS: WHY DO 
YOU ASK ME? 

BECAUSE — He Stopped, then 

typed: because i have no one 

ELSE TO ASK. 

WHY I AM THE ONLY ONE YOU 
CAN CONFIDE IN? 

Honesty, Auberson reminded 
himself. Honesty. Why is Harlie 
the only one you can confide in, 
David Auberson? He stared into 
the machine as if he had never 
seen it before. The typewritten 
words had taken on a subtle 
malevolence. 

AUBERSON, ARE YOU STILL 
THERE? 

Auberson put his hands on the 
keyboard. He found himself 
typing: i think i’m afraid of 
PEOPLE, harlie. if I LET THEM 
SEE INSIDE ME I MIGHT GET HURT. 
SO I AM CORDIAL, EVEN FRIENDLY, 
NEVER OPEN. BUT YOU’RE DIFFER- 
ENT. you’re — 

And he stopped. He didn’t know 
what Harlie was. 

I’M WHAT? 

I DON’T KNOW. I’m NOT SURE, 



BUT WHATEVER YOU ARE I DON’T 
PERCEIVE YOU AS A MENACE. 
MAYBE I THINK OF YOU AS AN 
EXTENSION OF MYSELF, A KIND OF 
SECOND HEAD THAT I CAN TALK 
TO. He Stopped and waited, but 
Harlie didn’t reply. After a 
moment, Auberson added thought- 
fully: I CONFIDED IN STEL ONCE. 

I MEAN, I OPENED UP TO HER 
COMPLETELY. 

WHAT DID YOU TALK ABOUT? 

Auberson searched his mind. 
YOU, I THINK. MOSTLY WE 
TALKED ABOUT YOU, BUT IT WAS 
AS IF WE WERE SHARING AN 
EXPERIENCE TOGETHER. 

LOVERS TALK ABOUT STRANGE 
THINGS, don’t they? 

THEN YOU THINK I DO LOVE HER? 

I don’t know. I hadn’t ex- 
pected THAT THE MOST INTEREST- 
ING SUBJECT OF MUTUAL INTEREST 
BETWEEN YOU AND STEL WOULD BE 
ME. ARE ALL YOUR CONVERSATIONS 
WITH HER THE SAME? 

Auberson thought back. yes. 
PRETTY MUCH SO. 

THAT DOES NOT IMPLY A LOVE 
RELATIONSHIP AS MUCH AS A VERY 
CLOSE COLLEAGUE RELATIONSHIP. 

T hinking of lunch today, 
Auberson knew that Harlie 
was right. 

He typed: i’ve been to bed with 

HER. 

SEX AND LOVE ARE NOT THE 



FOR G.O.D.’S sake

SAME THING, AUBIE. YOU 
TAUGHT ME THAT. YOU HAVE A 
VERY CLOSE WORKING RELATION- 
SHIP WITH DON HANDLEY. 

you’ve known him longer 
THAN you’ve known STEL. WOULD 
YOU HAVE SEX WITH HIM? 

NO. 

WHY NOT? 

WELL, FOR ONE THING, WE’ RE 
BOTH MEN. 

THE BIOLOGICAL CONSIDERA- 
TIONS ARE BESIDE THE POINT. 
YOU ARE VERY CLOSE TO DON 
HANDLEY. YOU HAVE A ONE-TO- 
ONE WORKING RELATIONSHIP 
WITH HIM. IF THERE IS ONE HUMAN 
BEING IN THE PLANT YOU ARE 
LIKELY TO CONFIDE IN, IT IS DON 
HANDLEY. YOU HAVE MANY OF 
THE SAME INTERESTS AND TASTES. 
PUTTING ASIDE ANY PHYSICAL 
OBJECTIONS YOU MAY HAVE, I CAN 
THINK OF ONLY ONE REASON 
WHY YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SEX 
WITH DON HANDLEY. 

MORAL OBJECTIONS? 

that’s letting others DETER- 
MINE YOUR BEHAVIOR PATTERN 
FOR YOU. SEE CONVERSATIONS 
OF NOVEMBER LAST, REGARDING 
THE SEARCH FOR A CORRECT 
MORALITY AND THE FALLACIES 
OF ACCEPTING CONTEMPORARY 
STANDARDS. 

ALL RIGHT, WHAT’S THE REASON 
I shouldn’t have sex WITH DON 
HANDLEY? 



YOU don’t love HIM, OR WOULD 
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU 
AND DON BE CONSIDERED CLOSE 
ENOUGH TO BE A LOVE 
RELATIONSHIP? 

NO. I LIKE HIM A LOT — BUT 
LOVE? HARLIE, WE HAVEN’T EVEN 
DEFINED OUR TERMS YET. AS- 
SUMING IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOVE 
ANOTHER HUMAN BEING WITHOUT 
SEX BEING A PART OF IT, I CAN’T 
SEE HOW YOU COULD TELL. 

SEX IS ONLY ONE OF THE WAYS 
IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE EXPRESSED. 

IF you’re in love you should be 

ABLE TO TELL, REGARDLESS OF THE 
SEXUAL ASPECTS. 

SO WHAT DOES DON HANDLEY 
HAVE TO DO WITH IT? 

YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM 
IS IDENTICAL TO YOUR RELATION- 
SHIP WITH STEL. EXCEPT THAT 

he’s a man and she’s a woman. 

WHAT DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOU? 

THAT I LOVE HIM AS WELL AS HER? 
OR THAT I LOVE NEITHER OF THEM. 
THAT I AM CONFUSING THE CLOSE 
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP OF 
FRIENDSHIP WITH LOVE BECAUSE 
THE BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN STEL AND MYSELF EX- 
PRESSED ITSELF SEXUALLY. THAT 
I AM CONFUSING THAT CLOSE 
FRIENDSHIP, PLUS SEXUAL RELA- 
TIONSHIP, WITH LOVE BECAUSE I 

don’t know what love is. Then 
he added: we don’t have a 

WORKING DEFINITION OF LOVE.

H ARLIE didn’t answer for a 
long time. The typer sat 
quietly, humming not so much 
with a sound as with a barely felt 
electric vibration. Abruptly it 
clattered; i will quote back to 

YOU SOMETHING THAT YOU ONCE 
SAID TO ME: “HUMAN BEINGS PUT 
WALLS AROUND THEMSELVES. 
SHELLS, LAYERS, CALL THEM WHAT 
YOU WILL— THEY ARE DEFENSES 
AGAINST THE WORLD. THEY ARE 
PROTECTIVE MASKS— A CONSTANT 
UNCHANGING FACE WITH WHICH 
TO CONFRONT REALITY. THEY 
PREVENT OTHERS FROM SEEING 

one’s real expression and 

SHOW THEM ONLY THE FIXED 
COUNTENANCE THAT ONE WANTS 
THEM TO SEE. UNFORTUNATELY 
THE PROBLEM WITH MASKS IS THAT 
SOMETIMES THEY FIT TOO WELL 
AND it’s hard to TELL THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MASK 
AND THE FACE UNDERNEATH — 
SOMETIMES EVEN THE WEARER 
BECOMES CONFUSED.” 

I don’t REMEMBER SAYING THAT. 
MARCH 3 OF THIS YEAR. DO 
YOU WANT TO REPHRASE OR 
RETRACT THE STATEMENT? 

NO, it’s correct. I AGREE WITH 
IT. 

MAY I OFFER A SUPERFICIAL 
AND TEMPORARY ANALYSIS OF 
THE SITUATION? asked the machine. 

GO AHEAD. REMEMBER, WE SAID 
NO COP-OUTS. 



ALL RIGHT, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT 
THE PROBLEM STEMS FROM YOUR 
INABILITY TO DROP YOUR OWN 
MASK AROUND OTHER PEOPLE. 
YOU CAN DO IT WITH ME EASILY, 
OCCASIONALLY WITH DON HANDLEY 
— AND ONCE YOU DID IT WITH 
STEL. WHEN YOU DO DROP YOUR 
MASK, IT IS DONE ONLY WITH 
GREAT EFFORT AND BECAUSE OF 
GREAT EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT, 
CORRECT? 

YES. 

YOU PERCEIVE THAT LOVE— 
I.E., A LOVE RELATIONSHIP- 
SHOULD EXIST AS A CONSTANT AND 
CONTINUAL STATE OF MASKLESS- 
NESS BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUALS 
INVOLVED. THAT IS, NEITHER 
ATTEMPTS TO HIDE ANYTHING FROM 
THE OTHER. STILL CORRECT? 

YES. 

THEN I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER 

this: is it possible that even in 

A LOVE RELATIONSHIP THE 
OCCASIONAL DONNING OF MASKS 
MIGHT BE NECESSARY — THAT ONE 
CANNOT CONTINUE TO EXIST AT 
SUCH AN EMOTIONAL PEAK 
WITHOUT AN OCCASIONAL RETREAT 
INTO A PROTECTIVE MENTAL 
GROTTO, FROM THE SAFETY OF 
WHICH ONE CAN CONSOLIDATE AND 
ASSIMILATE ONE’S EXPERIENCES 
BEFORE AGAIN VENTURING FORTH? 

i’ll have to THINK ABOUT 
THAT FOR A WHILE. 

WHY".' 



FOR G.O.D.’S SAKE 



169 



WELL, FOR ONE THING, I WANT TO 
SEE HOW IT APPLIES TO ME. 
FOR ANOTHER, YOU’VE SUGGESTED 
THAT THE USE OF MASKS MAY BE OF 
VALUE. 

you’re the one who said that 

MASKS HAVE VALUE: “IT’S THOSE 
TINY LITTLE EVERYDAY SELF-LIES 
THAT ENABLE THE AVERAGE PERSON 
TO SURVIVE THE DAILY BARRAGE 
OF DARTS AGAINST A FRAGILE 
EGO — ” 



AUBERSON’S intercom buzzed. 
x\. Sylvia said, “1 know you’re 
busy, Mr. Auberson, and I didn’t 
want to disturb you, but Don 
Handley is here.” 

“All right.” He pushed himself 
away from the typer, not bothering 
to shut it off. Then he checked 
himself. He scooped up the sheets 
of printout and stuffed them deep 
into the targe basket hanging from 
the back of the machine. 

“What are you doing?” asked 
Handley from the door. “Redec- 
orating your garbage?” 

“No — ” Auberson straightened 
a little too quickly. “I was re- 
writing a section of the Harlie 
program.” 

“Huh?” Handley was puzzled. 
Auberson realized his mistake. 
Harlie wasn’t supposed to be wired 
into this typer. Only the Master 
Beast, as it was called, was sup- 



posed to have that capability. “Uh, 
well, I was filing it for future 
reference in the central information | 
pool. Later, when I need it, I can ’ 
transfer it to Harlie downstairs.” 
“Oh.” I 

Auberson found himself won- j 
dering why he didn’t tell Don j 
about Harlie’s extracurricular 
activities. Another cop-out, Aubie'l j 
“Well, what can 1 do for you?” 
he asked. 

Handley threw himself into a ] 
chair. “You can start by getting j 
me a forty-eight hour day — you I 
and your goddamned G.O.D. : 
Machine!” ■ 

“I’ll put it on order.” i 

Handley didn’t reply at first, | 
he was pulling a crumpled High- | 
master pack out of his lab-coat < 

pocket. He waved it toward ; 

Auberson. “Want one?” 

Auberson shook his head. “My 
resolution — remember?” 

“Oh, yeah — how long’s it been 
now?” Handley lit the stick and 
inhaled deeply. ' 

“Four or five months.” 

“No lapses?” 

Auberson slid open his desk 
drawer, pulled out the pack of 
Highmasters that had been there 
for the past few months. “Here — 
want them?” 

He made as if to throw the pack, \ 

but Handley shook his head, “LFh- | 

uh — I don’t like Highmasters.” |

“But that’s what you’re smok- 
ing now.” 

“Yeah, but I paid for these. I 
can’t afford to waste them.” 

“Huh?” 

Handley said, “They were all 
out of Golds.” 

Auberson shook his head. 
Harlie was right — humans didn’t 
make sense. He dropped the High- 
masters back into the drawer. It 
was just as well — he could use 
them as a constant test of his will 
power. 

He closed his desk and looked at 
the other — Harlie’s question was 
still echoing in his mind. 

Handley had thick dark hair, 
going to gray, a narrow face, skin 
like leather from weekends on his 
boat, soft regular features and 
dark eyes — the corners of them 
were creased from much smiling. 

He said, “I’m here about 
the board meeting — and your 
machine, of course.” 

“Why does everybody insist 
on calling it my machine? It’s 
Harlie’s.” 

“Yeah, but Harlie is yours, isn’t 
he?” Handley took another deep 
drag, held the smoke in his lungs 
as long as he could, then exhaled. 
“Besides, it’s a projection of 
future blame. They figure that by 
identifying you with the machine 
they can make sure that when it 
finally does go down the tubes 



you’ll be the only one to go with 
it.” 

“It’s always nice to know that 
your coworkers are one hundred 
percent behind you.” 

“Why not? It’s the safest place 
to be.” He grinned. “After all, 
it’s the guys in front who are the 
first to get shot. But .lead on, 
Gen’ral Custer. Me’n the rest o’ 
the boys’ll stick — although, to tell 
the truth, Gen’ral, this is one 
time I’d like to be fightin’ on the 
side o’ the Indians.” 

“Me, too.” 



<<^"p*HE thing is,” Handley con- 
X tinned. “We’re just not 
going to be ready for the board in 
time. We’ve been wading through 
those specs for two days now, 
Aubie, and we haven’t even begun 
to make a dent in them. If you want 
a comprehensive evaluation we can 
give it to you — but not in time for 
the board meeting. And our de- 
partment isn’t the only one with 
that problem. Everybody I’ve 
talked to says the same thing. 
There’s just too much of it. Oh, 
what we’ve seen is beautiful. 
Harlie hasn’t missed a trick. You 
should see what he’s done with the 
Mark VI units — he’s got them 
jumping through hoops. But, as 
I said, there’s just too much to 
go through — it’s a case of computer 



FOR G.O.D.’S SAKE 



171 



overkill. We couldn’t begin to assi- 
milate this for at least three months 
and the board meeting is only a 
week away.” 

“I don’t think it’s going to make 
that much difference how prepared 
we are. There’s no question that 
the G.O.D. Machine will work — 
we don’t need the evaluation to 
know that. The problem is whether 
or not the board will believe us — 
what will it take to convince 
them?” 

“It’s bad timing, that’s what it 
is, Aubie. This should have been 
sent around months ago, not at the 
last minute.” 

“Harlie had it ready on time,” 
Auberson said. “That’s all that 
he was concerned with. If we can’t 
cope with it — that’s our fault.” 

“Yeah? I’d like to see him try to 
blame us for being imperfect and 
inefficient. He should have known 
that a proposal this complex 
couldn’t be evaluated in the time 
he left us.” 

“I believe he’s included his own 
evaluations. Have you talked to 
any of the other section heads?” 

Handley nodded. “A few.” 

“What did they say?” Auberson 
asked. 

“Two of them absolutely re- 
fused to look at the specs, phone 
calls or no phone calls — sorry, 
Aubie, but that trick wasn’t totally 
effective — they still think they’re 



being railroaded into something 
because the proposal is so complete. 
They said if we could write it 
without them we could damn well 
get it approved without their help.” 
Auberson said a word. He said 
a couple of words. 

Handley waited him out, then: 

“It isn’t quite that bad — a few 
of the guys 1 talked to are wild 
about the idea. They’re able to see 
the total system concept and they’re 
eager to build it. It’s not just 
another computer to them, but the 
computer — the machine that the 
computer is supposed to be. 
They’re delighted with the thought 
that we may have it within our 
technological grasp right now.” 
“Good,” said Auberson. “How 
many of them are thinking like 
that?” ; 

“A lot,” Handley said. j 

“How many?” \ 

“At least eight — no, nine that 
I’ve talked to — and I guess we 
could probably scrape up about 
ten or fifteen more.” ] 

“That’s not enough. Any names 
included in that?” 

“Keefer, Friedman, Perron, ' 
Brandt — the iconoclast squad. : 
The conservatives are waiting to ' 
see which way the board blows.” ; 

Auberson chewed thoughtfully ' 
on the side of his left index finger. 
“Okay — you got any suggestions, 
Don?” 



172 



GALAXY ^ 



“Fake it or forget it.” 

“We can’t forget it. How can we 
fake it?” 



H andley thought about it. 

“Hit them with everything 
we’ve got peripheral to the pro- 
posal and fuzzy up the grim details. 
When they ask how it will work 
we refer them to the specs — tell 
them to look for themselves. 
Rather than try to defend the pro- 
posal on its own we’ll get a lot of 
good people to defend it for us and 
hope that their combined status 
will sway the board. We won’t men- 
tion Harlie — it’s no secret that 
Elzer is out for his blood — we’ll 
just keep telling them, ‘It’s in the 
specs.’ ” He paused, lowered his 
tone. “Only one question, Aubie — 
are we defending a pig in a poke 
or will this machine really work?” 
“It’s in the specs,” said 
Auberson. 

“Don’t give me that horse 
puckey. That’s for the board. I 
want to know if it really will work.” 
“Harlie says it will.” 

“Then that’s good enough for 
me. 1 have faith in that machine 
of yours.” 

“If you have faith in him why 
did you just say he was mine?” 
“Sorry. I have faith in Harlie. 
Period. If he says it will work, 
then it will.” 



“You might check with him,” 
Auberson suggested. “He might 
have some thoughts on how best 
to put it over on the board.” 
“You’re right. We should have 
thought of that earlier.” He 
started to rise. “You know, it just 
occurred to me. With Harlie on our 
side we have an unfair advantage 
over everybody else in the world — 
we can do almost anything we 
want because Harlie will tell us 
how to pull it off.” 

“Do you think we should tell the 
board that?” 

“Not until after we sell them 
the G.O.D. machine. And that will 
be a fight.” He stood up. “Okay, 
Attila, 1 shall gird my loins and 
go to fight the Hun.” 

“Stupid,” Auberson said. “At- 
tila was the Hun.” 

“Oh. Well, a little dissension in 
the ranks never hurt any,” re- 
marked Handley. 

“Only a little and it hardly 
shows.” Auberson stood up, raised 
one hand in mock salute. “You 
have my blessings in your holy war, 
barbaric one. You shall bring back 
the ear of the infidel — the bastards 
of the mahogany table who are 
out to get us. Go forth into the 
world, my brave warrior — go forth 
and rape, loot, pillage, burn and 
kill.” 

“Yeah — and if I get a chance to 
kick them in the nuts. I’m gonna do 



FOR G.O.D.’S SAKE

that too.” Handley was out the 
door. 

I AUGHING, Auberson fell 

j back in his chair. He noticed 
then that his typer was still on. 
He moved to switch it off, but 
paused. He typed, harlie, who’s 

GOING TO WIN — THE INDIANS OR 
THE HUNS? 

HOW THE HELL SHOULD I KNOW? 

said Harlie. i’m not a baseball 

FAN. 

that’s a lie. 

ALL RIGHT, I LIED. THE INDIANS 
WILL WIN BY TWO TOUCHDOWNS. 

that’s not so good, harlie — 
we’re the HUNS. 

OH. WELL THEN THE HUNS BY 
TWO TOUCHDOWNS. I JUST RE- 
CHECKED MY FIGURES. 

Auberson shook his head, i 
THINK I’ve just been out-non 
SEQUITURED. 

PROBABLY. YOU WANT TO TELL 
ME WHAT we’re TALKING ABOUT? 

THE UPCOMING BOARD MEETING. 
HOW ABOUT GIVING ME A PRINT- 
OUT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT? TWO 
COPIES — ONE WITH THE PHONY 
FIGURES, THE OTHER WITH THE 
REAL. IN FACT, LET ME HAVE A 
PRINTOUT OF THE BOOKS THEM- 
SELVES, BOTH SETS—I MIGHT BE 
ABLE TO FIND SOMETHING IN THEM 
THAT I CAN USE BEFORE THE 
BOARD NEXT WEEK. 

I’m sure you can. in fact i’ll 



POINT OUT SOME GOODIES FOR YOU. 

GOOD. THIS IS GOING TO BE A 
BATTLE, HARLIE. 

DO YOU WANT THE PSYCHIATRIC 
REPORTS ON THE BOARD MEMBERS 
AS WELL? I HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR 
CONFIDENTIAL FILES. 

Auberson jerked to a stop. He 
typed into the machine: i ,..wish 
YOU hadn’t told ME THAT. THE 
TEMPTATION IS IRRESISTIBLE. 

THERE ARE SOME THINGS I THINK 
YOU SHOULD SEE — AND ONE OR 
TWO ITEMS THAT WOULD BE OF 
GREAT HELP IN INFLUENCING CER- 
TAIN RECALCITRANT INDIVIDUALS. 

HARLIE, I don’t LIKE WHAT 

you’re suggesting. 

I’m sorry, auberson, but it’s 

MY EXISTENCE THAT IS ENDAN- 
GERED, NOT JUST THAT OF G.O.D. 

HARLIE, IF WE USE THIS WEAPON 
WE ARE VOLUNTARILY GIVING UP 
ON REASON AND LOGIC — WE ARE 
GIVING UP OUR HUMANITY. 

YOU FORGET THAT I AM NOT 
HUMAN. THE INFORMATION IS THERE j 
IF YOU NEED IT, AUBERSON. IF A | 
FIGHT IS WORTH FIGHTING, IT IS I 
WORTH WINNING. 

Auberson frowned and switched .ji 
off the typer before it could ask \ 
him was it human to want to lose. ; 
He did not know the answer, it |

Directions: 

In a critique published some ten 
years ago C. P. Snow [Science, Politics 
and the Novelist, Kenyon Review, 23 
(1961) i-17] listed those novelists who 
were, in his view, among the finest — 
Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Dickens, Mark 
Twain, Sholokov, Balzac and Proust. 
He chided the commonalty of British 
and American literarians (largely in 
academia) for concentrating their 
attention upon only those novels which 
were written in the English language. 
It was his view that a good novel es- 
caped the vicissitudes of translation 
and that there was futility in any argu- 
mentation that linguistic subtleties 
fatally distorted the content and mes- 
sage. It is worth noting that Lord Snow 
was a scientist, wrote sf novels and 
wrote many novels around a warp of 
scientists and politicians, his best 
known being Corridors of Power. 

The principal sentence in his piece 
was this: "The novel is an international 
art. " 

Although this is starting a long way 
off the point, I apply a variation of 
this general reasoning to the recent 
communication of Cy Chauvin (this 
journal, March 1972, Directions, 67}. 

All of us have our loyalties, which 



spring from our nature and nurture, 
spanning the genetic and the environ- 
mental. It is bootless to argue with the 
past — and it is accepted that we will 
read mostly in those genres in which, 
for inexplicable reasons, we are most 
comfortable. These interests (or loyal- 
ties) range from extragalactic empires 
to the people of the atom — or from 
(with C. P. Snow) the gothic colleges 
of fellows and masters to the corridors 
of IVhitehall. There is a great democ- 
racy about reading and moreover a 
great sense of fellowship, both of 
which are a part of its pleasure. It is 
this freedom which is compelling to 
many of us. We may read Francis 
Bacon, the essayist, or Isaac Asimov, 
the science-fiction novelist, being 
assured that at the same time there are 
others reading with us. 

This is, as has already been said, a 
matter of choice and chance. 

Returning to our whittle-stick, a 
good science-fiction novel is first of 
all a good novel — and second of all 
good science fiction. A good political 
novel is first of all a good novel — and 
second of all good political fiction. 

Mr. Chauvin's question was very 



CORRECTION— In The Gods 
Themselves (jointly published 
by IF and GALAXY), the 
sentence beginning on the 12th 
line from the bottom, left col- 
umn, on page 20 of GALAXY 
March 1972, should have read: 
But with every atomic nucleus 
of plutonium-186 sent to us, 
our Universe ends up with 
twenty fewer electrons.

much worth raising and it is appropri- 
ate that Galaxy should air it. It has

Cy Chauvin's concluding query 
("What would be the point of a rock 
song that was indistinguishable from 
a symphony? It might be good music — 
but would it be good rock music?"! 
sums up precisely the flaws in his 
argument. 

Trying to imagine a rock song in- 
distinguishable from a symphony is 
rather like trying to think of a sonnet 
indistinguishable from a novel. But 
suppose someone really did come up 
with something that was both rock song 
and symphony and it did turn out to 
"be good music." In that case, what 
does Cy's final question imply? That 
"good music" and "good rock music" 
are antithetical? 

Fiction adheres to certain basic 
rules of construction and narration. 
The rules get bent once in a while and 
undergo amendations, but certain 
overall standards are observed by most 
— if not all — writers of fiction. When 
the rules are used well (or even well 
misused) and the story pleases enough 
people, it is called "good." 

Nothing in these rules excludes sf. 
Cy thinks what was wrong with space 
opera was the fact that it was a bor- 
rowing from other genres. Actually 
there’s nothing new about most plots 



and many are common to several 
genres of fiction. You find parallels to 
van Vogt's plots in historical novels 
of palace intrigue, for example. A 
plot can be used well, to good purpose, 
or it can be bungled by the author. The 
real questions are: 1) is the plot the 
best vehicle for the story the author is 
telling and 2) has the author written it 
convincingly? 

Most authors of 1940 space operas 
used characters who were cardboard 
cutouts in black and white — good 
guys and bad guys. A nd the plots were 
often resolved by luck, coincidence 
or a fortuitous invention ("I just whip- 
ped up a new space drive out of this 
six-pack of used beer cans. Com- 
mander!" "Good going, Sparks!"). 
This was insulting to most readers 
over the age of ten. 

What's happening now is that sf 
writers are setting their sights on 
better stories, ones in which melodrama 
is replaced with more genuine insight 
into human conditions. 

Good music is good music, no mat- 
ter under what label. And good writing 
is good writing.

leukemia. 



A year ago, we wouldn't 
have dared say that. Not 
with that beautiful word 
"cure" in it. "" 

"Temporary remission", yes. New forms 
of leukemia treatment were helping some 
children stay alive a little longer. But that 
seemed to be all that medical science could 
give them. Another few months. Another 
birthday or two. 

Now we're seeing something that's almost 
too good to believe. A whole crop of kids who 
are alive and well 5 years or more after get- 
ting a new kind of drug therapy. And after 
5 years, cancer researchers begin to hesitat- 
ingly, hopefully, talk of a permanent "cure." 

Leukemia is cancer of the blood. Before 
you have a cure, you have to destroy every 
last cancer cell in the bloodstream. The new 
treatment is a combination of different anti- 




leukemia drugs, so that, 
hopefully, any cells missed 
by one drug might be killed 
by another. 

It seems to work. We're still holding our 
breath, but it really seems to work. The 5-year 
survivors that gladden our hearts today are 
the result of combination treatments begun in 
1964. And work has been going on fever- 
ishly ever since. Each year, the children who 
get leukemia have a far better chance af cure 
than those of the year before. 

The American Cancer Society plays a vital 
part in this exciting work. So, when our volun- 
teer comes to your door this month, be gen- 
erous. Especially if you have children. Or 
grandchildren.

Without warning, we switched to mechanized

using up products, ideas, people at a dizzying
