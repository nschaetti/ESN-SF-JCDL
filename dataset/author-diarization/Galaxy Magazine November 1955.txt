WHO'LL BE AROUND? 



T HE question of racial survival 
is understandably on people’s 
minds. However, before the al- 
phabet-bombs made it a more 
immediate problem, researchers 
were wondering whether we’d do 
as well as the dinosaurs, who 
earned a handsome living for 
over 100,000,000 years — and 
don’t think they were in a low- 
rental area either. 

We’ve been around less than 
1,000,000 years and yet, these 
researchers have long been ask- 
ing, how soon will Man be re- 
placed . and by what? 

In the Scientific American 
Reader (Simon 8s Schuster), a 
typical article, called “Is Man 
Here to Stay?’’ by Loren C. Eise- 
ley, gives all the facts except the 
one I think is crucial and so can- 
not draw the most probable con- 
clusion. 

Dr. Eiseley offers a valid and 
yet misleading conflict: “There is 
a widespread tendency to con- 
ceive of the course of evolution 
as an undeviating upward march 
from the level of very simple or- 
ganisms to much more complex 
ones . the confusion lies in 
the fact that we fail to distinguish 

4 



adequately between progressive 
evolution in a single family line 
and those greater movements 
which adjust life to the rise and 
fall of continents or the chill 
winds of geological climate.” 
Versus : “Yet as one compares 
the durability of the simpler crea- 
tures with that of the more ef- 
ficient, one may be led to com- 
ment cynically that to evolve is 
to perish . obviously the com- 
pletely inadaptive organism can- 
not master a shifting environ- 
ment. Life must evolve to live. 
Why, then, are we confronted 
with the paradox that he who 
evolves perishes? Are we not the 
highest animal? And what, among 
all things that fly or creep or 
crawl, is more likely to inherit 
the future than we are?” 

Dr. Eiseley then quotes “the 
law of the unspecialized,” a con- 
tribution of Edward Drinker 
Cope, the great 19th century 
Quaker naturalist: 

“The highly developed, or 
specialized types of one geologi- 
cal period have not been the 
parents of the types of succeeding 
periods but . the descent has 
been derived from the less spe- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



cialized of preceding ages.” 

If there’s any confusion about 
the term “unspecialized,” George 
Gaylord Simpson’s The Meaning 
of Evolution explains: “It has 
been suggested that all animals 
are now specialized and that the 
generalized forms on which major 
evolutionary developments de- 
pend are now absent. In fact all 
animals have been more or less 
specialized, and a really general- 
ized living form is merely a myth. 
It happens that there are still in 
existence some of the less special- 
ized — that is, less narrowly ad- 
apted and more adaptable — 
forms from which radiations have 
occurred and could, as far as we 
can see, occur again. Opossums 
are not notably more specialized 
now than in the Cretaceous and 
could almost certainly radiate 
again markedly.” 

Why do very specialized fprms 
become extinct? When catas- 
trophe of one sort or another 
strikes, the form can’t adapt to 
the changed environment. Dr. 
Eiseley’s example is the anteater 
that starves' when ants grow 
scarce, even though there is an 
abundance of food for less spe- 
cialized animals. 

Three more quotations and I’ll 
get to my own point. Darwin pre- 
dicted: “We may look with some 
confidence to a future of great 
length ... All corporeal and men- 
tal endowments will tend to pro- 



gress toward perfection.” But that 
follows right after this: “Of the 
species now living very few will 
transmit progeny of any kind to 
a far distant future.” 

Can these two statements be 
accepted simultaneously? It isn’t 
easy, but I believe they can. Dr. 
Eiseley asks: “Is Man a special- 
ized or a generalized creature?” 
The answer, it seems to me, is a 
contradictory yes — he’s both. 

The true divisions of mankind 
are not racial, national or reli- 
gious. They’re the aptitude groups. 
The most extreme specializations 
appear to be the idiot savants, 
who can’t feed or clothe them- 
selves, but can do one thing su- 
premely well. If they are the end- 
product of our present trends, it’s 
not hard to imagine them be- 
coming extinct through inability 
to adapt to some drastic change. 

Is that good-by to Man? No, 
for there is the more generalized 
bulk of the species, far outnum- 
bering the increasingly narrowly 
specialized, and very well able to 
adapt to perhaps any change 
short of complete racial destruc- 
tion. 

And, I suppose,- capable of ra- 
diating into forms we can’t even 
imagine now, if the last part of 
Darwin’s prediction is to come 
true. 

Is this what he meant? I wish 
he had given us a bit of a clue.

The Ties of 



What was happening to Commager did worse 
than make no sense — it made too much sense 
— but which was true and which was not? 




PART 1 OF A 2-PART SERIAL 



T HE HAWKES residence 
lay in a back area of Bev- 
erly Hills, south of Wil- 
shire and west of La Brea. It was 
a big house for that neighbor- 
hood, a corner house set back 
from the street on both sides and 
screened by trellises, walls and 
the flanks of a large garage. 



“That’s the number,” Jean Bo- 
hart said, “but don’t stop. Drive 
on at least a block. .” 

Alan Commager pointed out 
that there ' was parking space 
right in front of the house. 

“I know,” Jean agreed nervous- 
ly, “but if we park there, some- 
body inside the house would no-

tice us and that would spoil the 
main purpose of our trip.” 

“You mean,” said Commager 
as he drove on obediently, “they’ll 
fold the black altar out of sight, 
drop the remains of the sacrificed 
virgin through a trap door and 
hose out the blood, while we’re 
stumbling across the dichondra? 



I thought we were expected.” 
“We’re not expected till ten- 
thirty,” Jean said. “Ira didn’t 
exactly make a point of it, but 
he mentioned they’d be doing 
other work till shortly after ten.” 
“Then I come on with the dice, 
eh? By the way, I didn’t bring 
any along. Would these Guides 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



7 



keep sordid little items like that 
around?” 

“It isn’t going to be a crap 
game, silly,” Jean informed him. 
“I told you Ira thinks these peo- 
ple can tell whether you were 
just lucky last week or whether 
you’ve developed some sort of 
special ability. They’ll test you 
— somehow.” 

/^OMMAGER looked down at 
her curiously. Jean was a 
slim blonde who could look crisp 
as chilled lettuce after an after- 
noon of smashing tennis matches 
followed by an hour of diving 
practice off the high board. She 
wasn’t intellectually inclined, but, 
understandably, Ira Bohart had 
never seemed to mind that. 
Neither did Commager. However, 
she seemed disturbed now. 

“Are you beginning to get in- 
terested in that sort of thing 
yourself?” he inquired lightly. 

“No,” she said. “I’m just wor- 
ried about that husband of mine. 
Honestly, Alan, this is as bad a 
metaphysical binge as he’s ever 
been on! And some of those exer- 
cises he was showing me yester- 
day sort of scared me. If they 
do something like that tonight, 
I’d like to know what you think 
of it.” 

“It’s just somebody else ort the 
trail of the Bohart stocks and 
bonds, Jeannie! Ira will get dis- 
illusioned again before any harm 

8 



is done. You know that, Jeannie.” 

“That’s what I keep telling my- 
self,” Jean agreed unhappily. “But 
this time — ” 

Commager shook his head, 
parked the car and let her out, 
a block and a half from the 
Hawkes home. “Did you try any 
of those exercises yourself?” 

“I’m not that loony,” Jean said 
briefly. “Anyway, Ira advised me 
not to.” 

They walked back to the house 
in brooding silence. Between 
them, they’d seen Ira through a 
bout of Buddhism and successive 
experiences with three psycho- 
logical fringe groups, in relentless 
pursuit of some form of control 
of the Higher Mind. After each 
such period, he would revert for 
a while to despondent normalcy. 

Four years ago, it had seemed 
rather amusing to Commager, be- 
cause then it had been Lona 
Commager and Ira Bohart who 
went questing after the Inex- 
pressible together, while Alan 
Commager and Jean Bohart went 
sea-fishing or skin-diving off 
Catalina. But then Lona had died 
and the Inexpressible stopped be- 
ing a source of amusement. Some- 
times Ira bored Commager to 
death these days. But he still 
liked Jean. 

W 'W HY PICK on me to ex- 
” pose these rascals any- 
way?” he asked as they came in 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



s’ght of the house. “I may have 
surprised the boys at Las Vegas 
last week, but I couldn’t tell a 
psychic phenomenon from a ring- 
ing in my ears.” 

She patted his arm. “That may 
be true, but you do intimidate 
people,” she explained. 

“Shucks!” Commager said mod- 
estly. It was true, though; he did. 
“So I’m to sit there and glare 
at them?” 

“That’s the idea. Just let them 
know you see through their little 
tricks and I’ll bet they lose in- 
terest in Ira before the evening’s 
out! Of course, you don’t have to 
put it on too thick. .” 

Their host, Herbert Hawkes, 
for one, didn’t look like a man 
who’d be easy to intimidate. He 
was as big as Commager himself 
and about the same age; an ex- 
football player, it turned out. He 
and Commager exchanging crush- 
ing hand-grips and soft smiles, as 
big men will, and released each 
other with mutual respect. 

Ira, who didn’t seem any more 
gaunt and haggard than usual, 
had appeared a little startled by 
their entry, possibly because they 
were early, but more likely, Com- 
mager thought, because of a girl 
who had coiled herself becom- 
ingly on the couch very close to 
Ira. 

At first glance, this siren 
seemed no more than seventeen 
— a slender, brown-skinned crea- 



ture in an afternoon dress the 
exact shade of her skin — but 
by the time they were being in- 
troduced, Commager had added 
twelve years to her probable age. 

She was Ruth MacDonald, she 
told him, secretary of the Para- 
psychological Group of Long 
Beach. Had he heard of it? He 
said it sounded familiar, which 
was untrue, but it seemed to 
please Miss MacDonald. 

The only other person present, 
a fifty-odd, graying teddy-bear of 
a man with very thick eyebrows, 
announced he was the Reverend 
Wilson Knox, president of the 
Temple of Antique Christianity. 
The Reverend, Commager real- 
ized, was pretty well plastered, 
though there was no liquor in 
sight. 

rpHEIR INTERESTS might be 
unusual, but they hardly 
seemed sinister. Commager was 
practically certain he could iden- 
tify Herbert Hawkes as the 
owner of one of the biggest down- 
town automobile agencies — 
which made him an unlikely sort 
of man to be a member of a 
group called the Guides. It was 
Hawkes’s own affair, but it prom- 
ised to make the evening more 
interesting than Commager had 
expected. 

“Were we interrupting any- 
thing?” he inquired, looking 
around benevolently. 



THE TIES OF EARTH

Ira cleared his throat. “Well, 
as a matter of fact, Alan, we 
were conducting a series of ex- 
periments with me as the guinea- 
pig at the moment. Rather inter- 
esting actually — ” He seemed a 
trifle nervous. 

Commager avoided Jean’s 
glance. “Why not just continue?” 
“We can’t,” the Reverend 
Knox informed him solemnly. 
“Our high priestess was called to 
the telephone a few minutes ago. 
We must wait until she returns.” 
Ira explained hurriedly, “Mr. 
Knox is talking about Paylar. 
She’s connected with the new 
group I’m interested in, the 
Guides. I suppose Jean told you 
about that?” 

“A little.” Commager waved 
his hand around. “But I thought 
you people were the Guides.” 
Hawkes smiled. 

Wilson Knox looked startled. 
“Goodness, no, Mr. Commager! 
Though as a matter of fact — ” 
he glanced somewhat warily at 
his two companions — - “if some- 
one here were a Guide, that per- 
son would be the only one who 
knew it! And, of course, Paylar. 
That’s right, isn’t it, Ruth?” 

Miss MacDonald nodded and 
looked bored. 

Jean said to Ira, “All I really 
told Alan was that some friends 
of yours would like to experi- 
ment with — well, whatever you 
think he was using in that crap 

10 



game last week.” She smiled 
brightly at the group. “Mr. Com- 
mager actually won eleven hun- 
dred dollars in fifteen minutes of 
playing!” 

“Ah, anybody could if they 
kept the dice for fifteen minutes,” 
Commager said airily. “Question 
of mind over matter, you know.” 
“Eleven hundred dollars? Phe- 
nomenal!” Wilson Knox came 
wide awake. “And may I ask, sir, 
whether you employ your powers 
as a professional gambler?” 

Commager replied no, that 
professionally he was a collector, 
importer, wholesaler and retailer 
of tropical fish. Which was, as it 
happened, the truth, but the Rev- 
erend looked suspicious. 

A DOOR opened then and two 
other people came in. One 
was a handsome though sullen- 
faced young man whose white- 
blond hair had been trimmed into 
a butch haircut. He was deeply 
tanned, wore a tee-shirt, white 
slacks, sneakers and looked gen- 
erally as if he would be at home 
on Muscle Beach. 

The other one had to be Pay- 
lar: a genuine Guide or, at least, 
a direct connection to them. She 
was downright cute in a slender, 
dark way. She might be in her 
early twenties. 

But for a moment, as Com- 
mager stood up to be introduced, 
he had the confused impression 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that jungles and deserts and 
auroras mirrored in ice-flows had 
come walking into the room with 
her. 

Well, well, he thought. Along 
with Hawkes, here was another 
real personality. 

They didn’t continue with the 
experiments on Ira. Wilson Knox 
reported Commager’s feat in Las 
Vegas to Paylar, who seemed to 
know all about it, and then went 
bumbling on into a series of anec- 
dotes about other dice manipu- 
lators he had known or heard 
about. 

Except for the Boharts, the 
others listened with varying ex- 
pressions of polite boredom. But 
Ira seemed genuinely fascinated 
by the subject and kept glancing 
at Commager, to see how he was 
taking it. Jean became argumen- 
tative. 

“Nobody can really prove that 
anyone has such abilities!” she 
stated decisively. “Ira’s been 
working around with this sort of 
thing for years and he’s never 
shown me anything that couldn’t 
have been a coincidence!” 

Ira grinned apologetically. Wil- 
son Knox sent a quick glance 
toward Paylar, who had settled 
herself in an armchair to Com- 
mager’s left. The Reverend, Com- 
mager thought, seemed both 
miffed and curiously apprehen- 
sive. 

Commager’s own interest in 



the group became suddenly more 
lively. 

“There are people in this world 
today, my dear young lady,” Wil- 
son Knox was telling Jean, “who 
control the Secret Powers of the 
Universe!” 

Jean sighed. “When Ira tells 
me something like that, I always 
want to know why we don’t hear 
what these mysterious people are 
doing.” 

WILSON KNOX glanced at 
” Paylar again. And this time, 
Commager decided, there was no 
question about it: the odd little 
man seemed genuinely alarmed. 
The bushy eyebrows were work- 
ing in unconcealed agitation. 

“We must consider,” he told 
Jean helplessly, “that such peo- 
ple may have their own reasons 
for not revealing their abilities.” 

“Hm!” sniffed Jean. 

Commager laughed. “Mrs. Bo- 
hart has a point there, you know,” 
he said to Paylar. “I understand 
the Guides imply they can, at 
any rate, train people to develop 
extrasensory abilities. Would you 
say they can produce some tangi- 
ble proof for that claim?” 

“Sometimes,” she said. “With 
some people.” She looked a little 
tired of the subject, as if it were 
something she had heard dis- 
cussed often, as she probably had, 
so Commager was surprised when 
she added in the same tone, “I 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



1 1 



could, I think, produce such 
proofs very easily for you, Mr. 
Commager. To your own satis- 
faction, at least.” 

As she turned to look at him, 
her dark elfin face sober and con- 
fident, Commager was aware of 
a sudden stillness in the room. 
Wilson Knox started what 
seemed to be a protesting gesture 
and subsided again. And Jean 
was frowning, as if she had just 
discovered an unexpected uncer- 
tainty in herself. 

“It’s a fair offer,” Commager 
acknowledged. “If you’re suggest- 
ing an experiment, I’ll be glad 
to cooperate.” 

For a moment, he saw some- 
thing almost like compassion in 
the serious young face that 
studied him. Then Paylar turned 
to the others. “Would you ar- 
range the lighting in the usual 
way? Mr. Commager, I should 
like you to sit here.” 

It was what they had come 
here for, Commager thought. 
Hawkes and the blond young 
man, whose name was Lex Barth- 
old, went about the room adjust- 
ing the lights. Commager had a 
strong impression that Jean now 
would just as soon keep the ex- 
periment from being carried out, 
if she could think of a good 
enough reason. 

But the experiment would be 
a flop anyway. No such half- 
mystical parlor games had

worked on Commager since Lona 
had died. 

II 

IN COMMAGER’S tropical fish 

store on Wilshire Boulevard, 
there were display tanks that 
were laid out with the casual 
stateliness of an English park 
and others that had the formal 
delicacy of a Chinese garden or 
that appeared to copy, in fantas- 
tic miniature detail, sections of 
some dreamland salt-water reef. 
These were the designs of two 
artistically minded girls who 
managed the store for Commager 
and they were often expensively 
duplicated by artists themselves 
in the homes of the shop’s less 
talented patrons. 

But the tanks that most inter- 
ested Commager were the big 
ones in the back of the store, 
partitioned off from the plate- 
glass windows and the displays 
that faced the boulevard. Here 
fish and plants were bred, raised 
and stocked without regard for 
art, and the effect, when you sat 
down to watch them for a while, 
was that of being in the center 
of a secret, green-lit jungle out 
of which God knew what might 
presently come soaring, wriggling 
or crawling at you. 

It wasn’t a bad way, in Com- 
mager’s opinion, to pass a few 
hours at night, when you didn’t 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



happen to be in a mood either 
for sleep or human company. In 
his case, that might happen once 
or twice a week, or perhaps less 
than once a month. When it hap- 
pened more often, it was time to 
get organized for another one of 
those trips that would wind up 
at some warm and improbable 
point on the big globe of Earth, 
where people were waiting to 
help Commager fill his transport 
tanks with brightly colored little 
water-creatures — which, rather 
surprisingly, provided him with 
a very good income. 

It was a pattern he had fol- 
lowed for most of the second 
half of his thirty-four years, the 
only two interruptions having 
been the second world war and 
the nineteen months he’d been 
married to Lona. 

It was odd, he thought, that 
he’d never found anything more 
important to do with his life than 
that, but the personal games he 
could watch people play didn’t 
seem to be even as interesting 
as the one he’d chosen for him- 
self. 

Also, he went on thinking half- 
seriously, if you got right down 
to it, probably all the important 
elements of life were contained 
right inside the big tank he was 
observing at the moment, so that 
if he could really understand 
what was going on in there, 
brightly and stealthily among the 



green underwater thickets, he 
might know all that could be 
known about the entire Universe. 

Considered in that light, the 
tank became as fascinating as a 
stage play in a foreign language, 
in which the actors wore the 
bright masks of magic and played 
games that weren’t so very un- 
like those being played by hu- 
man beings. But any real under- 
standing of the purpose of the 
play, human or otherwise, always 
had seemed a little beyond Com- 
mager’s reach. 

TT E YAWNED and shifted 
position in the chair he had 
pulled up for himself. Perhaps he 
was simply a bit more stupid 
than most. But there was a fret- 
ting feeling that this game play- 
ing, whether on a large scale or 
a small one, never really led to 
much, beyond some more of the 
same. There was, he conceded, a 
good deal of satisfaction in it for 
a time, but in the long run, the 
returns started to diminish. 

It seemed that things — in 
some way Commager couldn’t 
quite fathom — should have been 
arranged differently. 

A car passing on the street out- 
side sent ' a whisper of sound 
along the edge of his conscious- 
ness. With that came the aware- 
ness that it had been some time 
since he’d last heard a car go by 
and he found himself wondering 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



13 



suddenly what time of night it 
was. 

He glanced at his wristwatch. 
Three-thirty. A little startled, he 
tried to compute how long he 
had been sitting there. 

Then it struck him in a surge 
of panic that he couldn’t remem- 
ber coming to the store at all! 

But, of course, his memory 
told him, you went with Jean to 
that house. 

And Paylar had asked him to 
sit down and . 

What kind of stunt had she 
pulled on him? 

The blackness of terror burst 
into his consciousness as soon as 
his thoughts carried him that far 
— and it wiped out memory. He 
tried again, 

A black explosion. He pushed 
at it and it retreated a little. 

It had been between ten and 
eleven o’clock. Five hours or so 
ago. What was the last specific 
thing he could remember? 

H E HAD been sitting in a 
chair, his eyes closed, a little 
amused, a little bored. It had 
been going on for some time. 
Paylar, a quiet voice off to his 
left, was asking him a series of 
odd questions. 

PAYLAR: But where are you, 
Mr, Commager? 

COMM ACER: (tapping his fore- 
head): Right here! Inside my 
head. 

14 



PAYLAR: Could you be more 
specific about that? 
COMMAGER (laughing) : I’m 
somewhere between my ears. Or 
somewhere back of my eyes. 
PAYLAR: How far do you seem 
to be from the right side of your 
head? Do you sense the exact 
distance? 

Commager discovered he could 
sense the exact distance. As a 
point of awareness, he seemed to 
be located an inch inside the 
right side of his skull. Simultane- 
ously, though, he noticed that his 
left ear was less than an inch 
and a half away from the same 
spot — which gave him briefly 
an odd impression of the general 
shape of his head! 

But he realized then that his 
attention was shifting around in 
there, rapidly and imperceptibly. 
His ears seemed to be now above 
him, now below and, for a mo- 
ment, the top of his skull seemed 
to have moved at least a yard 
away. 

He laughed. “How am I 
doing?” 

Paylar didn’t answer. Instead, 
she asked him to imagine that he 
was looking at the wall in front 
of him. 

After a while, that wasn’t too 
difficult; Commager seemed to be 
seeing the wall clearly enough, 
with a standing lamp in either 
corner, where Hawkes had placed 
them. Next, the voice told him 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to imagine that the same wall 
now was only a few inches in 
front of his face — and then that 
it suddenly had moved six feet 
behind him. It gave him an odd 
feeling of having passed straight 
through the wall in the moment 
of shifting it. 

“Put it twenty feet in front of 
you again,” she said. “And now 
twenty feet behind you.” 

Again the sensation of shift- 
ing iri space, as if he were swing- 
ing back and forth, past and 
through the wall. Commager had 
become alert and curious now. 

On the third swing, he went 
straight into the blackness . 
with panic howling around him! 
After that, everything was blot- 
ted out. 

H E COULDN’T, Commager 
discovered, close the gap 
any farther now. Somewhere near 
eleven o’clock in the evening, he’d 
gone into that mental blackout 
with its peculiarly unpleasant 
side-effects. His next memory 
might have been twenty minutes 
ago, when he found himself star- 
ing into the miniature underwater 
forest of the fish tank in his store. 

He could phone the Bohart 
apartment, he thought, and find 
out what actually had happened. 
Immediately, then, he became 
aware of an immense reluctance 
to carry out that notion and he 
grimaced irritably. It was no time 



to worry about what the Boharts 
might think, but he could imagine 
Jean’s sleepy voice, annoyedly 
asking who was calling at this 
hour. 

And he’d say, “Well, look, I’ve 
lost my memory, I’m afraid. A 
piece of it anyway — ” 

He shook his head. They’d 
gone there to show up the Guides, 
after all! He’d have to work this 
out by himself. As if in response 
to his line of thought, the office 
telephone, up in the front of the 
store, began ringing sharply. 

The unexpected sound jolted 
Commager into a set of chills. He 
sat there stiffly, while the ring 
was repeated four times; and 
then, because there was really 
no reason not to answer it, no 
matter how improbable it was 
that someone would be calling 
the store at this time of night, he 
got up and started toward the 
telephone down the long aisle of 
back-store tanks. Here and there, 
one of the tanks was illuminated 
by overhead lights, like the one 
before which he’d been sitting. 

At the corner, where he turned 
from the aisle into the office, 
something lay in his path. 

He almost stepped on it. He 
stopped in shock. 

It was a slender woman, lying 
half on her side, half on her face, 
in a rumpled dress and some- 
thing like a short white fur 
jacket. 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



15 



Her loose hair hid her face. 

The telephone kept on shrill- 
ing. 

/^OMMAGER dropped to one 
knee beside the woman, 
touched her and knew she was 
dead, turned her over by the 
shoulders and felt a stickiness on 
his hands. There was a slanting 
cut across her throat, black in 
the shadows. 

“Well,” a voice inside Com- 
mager’s head said with insane 
calm, “if it isn’t Miss MacDon- 
ald!” He felt no pity for her at 
the moment and no real alarm, 
only a vast amazement. 

He realized that the telephone 
had stopped ringing and clusters 
of thought burst suddenly and 
coherently into his awareness 
again. Somebody apparently 
thought he was here, at three- 
thirty in the morning — the same 
somebody might also suspect that 
Miss MacDonald was here and 
even in what condition. And the 
phone could have been dialed 
quite deliberately at that moment 
to bring Commager out of the 
hypnotized or doped trance, or 
whatever it was that somebody 
knew he was trapped in. 

In which case, they might be 
wanting him to discover Ruth 
MacDonald’s body at about this 
time. 

It would be better, he thought, 
not to get tangled up just now 

16 



in wondering why anyone should 
want that to happen; or even 
whether, just possibly, it had 
been he himself who had cut Miss 
MacDonald’s brown throat. 

What mattered was th&t, at 
this instant, somebody was ex- 
pecting him to react as reason- 
ably as a shocked and stunned 
man could react in such a situa- 
tion. 

The only really reasonable 
course of action open to him was 
to call the police promptly — 
wherefore, if his curiously calm 
assumption was correct, he would 
be primarily expected to do just 
that. It would be much less rea- 
sonable, though still not too un- 
likely, to carry that ghastly little 
body far off somewhere and lose 
it. 

Or he could just walk out of 
here and leave Miss MacDonald 
on the floor, to be discovered by 
the store’s staff in the morning. 
That would be a stupid thing to 
do, but still something that might 
be expected of a sufficiently 
dazed and frightened man. 

So he wouldn’t do any of those 
things! The hunch was strong in 
him that the best way to react 
just now was in a manner un- 
reasonable beyond all calculation. 

H E SHOVED Ruth MacDon- 
ald’s body aside and flicked 
on his cigarette lighter. On the 
floor were gummily smeared 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



spots, but she had bled to death 
somewhere else before she had 
been dropped here! 

Commager’s hands and clothes 
were clean, so it was very im- 
probable that he had carried her 
in. The sensible thing, he thought, 
would be to clean up the few 
stains on the floor before he left, 
removing any obvious evidence 
that Miss MacDonald had been 
in the store at all. 

Wherefore, he didn’t bother to 
do it. 

Nor did he waste time wonder- 
ing whether a half dozen tanks 
in the back part of the store had 
been lit when he came in here 
or not. There was a variety of 
possible reasons why someone 
might have left a light on over 
some of them. 

He picked up the slender stiff- 
ening body on the floor and car- 
ried it to the front door. 

The door was unlocked and 
his Hudson was at the curb. He 
shifted Miss MacDonald to one 
arm, locked the store door behind 
him, then placed her in the back 
seat of the car. 

Even Wilshire Boulevard was 
a lonely street at this hour, but 
he saw several sets of headlights 
coming toward him as he got into 
the car and started it. As far as 
he could make out, there hadn’t 
been any blood spilled around 
inside the Hudson, either. 

Twelve minutes later, he drove 



past the corner house he’d visited 
with Jean Bohart some time be- 
fore ten in the evening. There 
was a light on in one of the rooms 
upstairs, which distinguished 
Herbert Hawkes’s home from any 
other house in sight. A few blocks 
away, a dog began to bark. 

Dogs might be a problem, he 
thought. 

C OMMAGER parked the car 
a few hundred feet away and 
sat still for perhaps a minute, 
listening. The dog stopped bark- 
ing. Headlights crossed an inter- 
section a few blocks ahead of 
him. 

He got out, lifted Miss Mac- 
Donald’s body out of the car and 
walked unhurriedly back to the 
corner house and over the step- 
ping stones of the dichondra lawn 
to the side of the house. Here 
was a trellis, with a gate in it, 
half open. 

Commager eased his burden 
sideways through the gate. In the 
half-light of early morning, he 
set Ruth MacDonald down under 
a bush — which partly concealed 
her — in about the same posi- 
tion in which he’d found her. He 
had a moment of pity to spare 
for her now. 

But there was motion inside 
the house. Commager looked at 
the door that opened into this 
side garden. A vague sequence of 
motions; somebody walking quiet- 



T H E TIES OF EARTH 



17 



ly — but without any suggestion 
of stealth — was coming closer 
to the door. Commager stepped 
quietly up to the wall beside the 
door and flattened himself against 
the wall. 

A key clicked in the lock. The 
door swung open. A big shape 
sauntered out. 

Commager’s fist was cocked 
and he struck hard, slanting up- 
ward, for the side of the neck 
and the jaw. 

He laid Herbert Hawkes down 
beside the body of Ruth Mac- 
Donald, one big arm draped 
across her shoulders. 

Let the Guides figure that one 
out, he thought wearily. Not that 
they wouldn’t, of course, but he 
was going to continue to react 
unreasonably. 

Twenty minutes later, he was 
in his apartment and sound 
asleep. 

Ill 

HP HE BEDSIDE phone buzzed 
waspishly. Commager hung 
for a moment between two levels 
of awareness. The blazing excite- 
ment of the fight was over, but 
he still hated to relinquish the 
wild, cold, clear loneliness of the 
blue — 

The thin droning continued to 
ram at his eardrums. His eyes 
opened and he sat up, reaching 
for the telephone as he glanced 



at the clock beside it. 8:15. 

“Alan? I think it worked! Ira 
had breakfast and drove off to 
the office, wrapped in deep 
thought. You were terrific, simply 
terrific! Just sitting there like a 
stone wall — 

Commager blinked, trying to 
catch up with her. Jean Bohart 
had an athlete’s healthy contempt 
for lie-a-beds and felt no com- 
punction about jolting them out 
of their torpor. She probably as- 
sumed he’d been up and around 
for the past two hours. 

Then his waking memories 
suddenly flooded back. He sucked 
in a shocked breath. 

“Eh?” She sounded startled. 

“I didn’t say anything,” he 
managed. “Go ahead — ” 

He wouldn’t, he realized pres- 
ently, have to ask Jean any 
leading questions. There was a 
nervous tension in her that, on oc- 
cation, found its outlet in a burst 
of one-way conversation and this 
was such an occasion. The Bo- 
harts had left the Hawkes home 
shortly before twelve, Ira appar- 
ently depressed by the negative 
results of the evening. The Rev- 
erend Knox had made a phone 
call somewhat earlier and had 
been picked up within a few 
minutes by an elderly woman 
who, in Jean’s phrasing, looked 
like a French bulldog. 

“I think he was glad to get 
out of there!” she added. 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



C OMMAGER didn’t comment 
on that. He himself had 
stayed On with the others. Ruth 
MacDonald, in Jean’s opinion, 
was making a pretty definite play 
for him by that time, while Pay- 
lar — “What’s her last name, 
anyway?” — had become with- 
drawn to the point of rudeness 
after Commager’s spectacular 
lack of reaction to her psycho- 
logical games. 

“I think she knew just what 
we were doing by then!” Jean’s 
voice held considerable satisfac- 
tion. “So did that Hawkes char- 
acter. Did you know he’s the 
Herbert Hawkes who owned the 
Hawkes Chrysler Agency on 
Figueroa? Well, there’s some- 
thing interesting about that — ” 
Hawkes had sold out his busi- 
ness about eight months before 
and it was generally known that 
his reason had been an imminent 
nervous breakdown. “What do 
you make of that, Alan?” 

Offhand, Commager admitted, 
he didn’t know what to make 
of it. 

Well, Jean interrupted, she was 
convinced Hawkes had gone the 
way Ira would have gone if they 
hadn’t stopped him. “Those 
Guides have him hypnotized or 
something!” She laughed nerv- 
ously. “Does it sound as if I’m 
getting too dramatic about it?” 
“No,” he said, recalling his last 
glimpse of Hawkes and his horrid 



little companion much too vivid- 
ly. “He doesn’t strike me as act- 
ing like a man who’s been hypno- 
tized, though. Not that I know 
much about that sort of thing.” 

Jean was silent, thinking. “Did 
anything in particular develop 
between you and the MacDon- 
ald?” she asked suddenly. There 
was a strange sharpness in her 
tone. 

Commager felt himself whiten. 
“No,” he said, “I just went home 
by and by.” He tried for a teasing 
“Are you jealous, little pal?” 
note. “Were you worrying about 
it?” 

“She’s poison, that’s all!” Jean 
said sharply. 

A FTER SHE hung up, Com- 
mager showered, shaved, 
dressed and breakfasted, with 
very little awareness of what he 
was doing. He was in a frame of 
mind he didn’t entirely under- 
stand himself; under a flow of 
decidedly unpleasant specula- 
tions was a layer of tingling, al- 
most physical elation which, 
when he stopped to consider it, 
appeared a less than intelligent 
response to his present situation. 
But the realization didn’t seem 
to affect the feeling. 

The feeling vanished abruptly 
when he dumped the clothes he’d 
been wearing the night before 
out of the laundry bag into which 
he had stuffed them, along with 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



19 



the blanket on which he’d laid 
Ruth MacDonald’s body in the 
car. 

He had handled her with some 
caution and he couldn’t discover 
marks on any of those articles 
now that seemed likely to in- 
criminate him. But he had no 
doubt that a more competent in- 
vestigation could reveal them. 

The odd thing was that he still 
couldn’t get himself to worry 
about such an investigation! He 
had no logical basis for his belief 
that unless he himself announced 
the murder of the secretary of 
the Parapsychological Group of 
Long Beach, nobody else was go- 
ing to take that step. He couldn’t 
even disprove that he hadn’t, 
somewhere along the line last 
night, dropped into sheer crimi- 
nal lunacy. 

But, so far, nobody had come 
pounding at his door to accuse 
him of murder. And Commager 
retained the irrationally obstin- 
ate conviction that nobody would. 

He had an equally strong con- 
viction that he had become the 
target of the relentless hostility 
of a group of people, of whose 
existence he hadn’t known until 
the day before — and that he 
wouldn’t know why until he dis- 
covered the reason for his loss 
of conscious memory in a period 
during which he had, to Jean 
Bohart’s discerning eyes, showed 
no noticeable change in behavior. 



And, Commager decided fin- 
ally, he’d better not let the lack 
of satisfactory conscious evidence 
for either certainty affect his 
actions just now. 

H E MADE two appointments 
by telephone and left the 
apartment an hour after he’d 
been wakened. A few minute® 
later, he was at the store, which 
would open for business at ten 
o’clock. 

Commager unlocked the door 
and strolled inside. The store’s 
staff had got there at nine and 
the floors, he noticed, had been 
thoroughly mopped. Nobody in- 
quired whether he’d been in dur- 
ing the night, so it seemed he 
had guessed right in leaving the 
lights on over the big tanks. 

He drove into Los Angeles 
then, to keep his first appoint- 
ment, at Dr. Henry L. Warbutt’s 
Psychology Center. 

Henry was a stout, white- 
haired, energetic little man with 
the dark melancholy eyes of one 
of the great apes. “Thirty minutes 
for free is all I can spare, even 
for orphans,” he informed Com- 
mager. “But you’re welcome to 
that, so come in and sit down, 
boy! Cup of tea, eh? What do 
you hear from the Boharts?” 
Commager declined the tea, 
which was likely to be some nasty 
kind of disguised health-brew, 
and stated that the Boharts, when 

t 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



20 



last heard from, had been doing 
fine. It wasn’t his first visit to the 
Center. Both of his parents had 
been dead before he was twelve 
and Henry, who was a relative 
on his father’s side, had been his 
legal guardian until he came of 
age. 

“I want to find out what you 
know about a new local organi- 
zation called the Guides,” Com- 
mager explained. “They’re on the 
metaphysical side, I’d say, but 
they seen to be doing some 
therapy work. They’re not listed 
in the telephone book.” 

Henry looked slightly dis- 
turbed. “If you mean the Guides 
I’m thinking of, they’re not so 
new. How did you hear about 
them? Is Ira messing around with 
that outfit now?” 

Commager told him briefly of 
last night’s earlier events, pre- 
senting Jean Bohart’s version of 
his own role in them, as if that 
were the way he recalled it him- 
self. 

H ENRY became interested at 
that point. “Do you remem- 
ber just what those exercises 
were that the woman put you 
through?” 

When Commager had . de- 
scribed them, he nodded. “They 
got those gimmicks from another 
group. I’ve used them myself 
now and then. Not on cash clients, 
of course, just as an experiment. 

THE TIES OF EARTH 



The idea is to divert your atten- 
tion away from your body-ego, 
if you know what I mean. No? 
Well, then — ” 

He made a steeple of his hands 
and scowled at his fingertips. 
“Metaphysically, it’s sometimes 
used as a method to get you out 
of your physical body.” He waved 
his hands vaguely around. “Off 
you go into the astral plane or 
something!” He grinned. “Under- 
stand now?” 

“More or less,” Commager said 
doubtfully. “Did you ever see it 
happen?” 

“Eh? Oh, no! With me, they 
usually just go to sleep. Or else 
they get bored and won’t react 
at all, about like you did. There’s 
no therapeutic value in it that I 
know of. But probably no harm, 
either.” 

“Would you say whether 
there’s any harm in the Guides?” 

“Well,” said Henry thoughtful- 
ly, “they’re certainly one of the 
more interesting groups of our 
local psychological fauna. Per- 
sonally, I wouldn’t go out of my 
way to antagonize them. Of 
course, Ira’s such a damn fool, 
you probably had to do some- 
thing pretty obvious to discour- 
age him. Fifteen or twenty years 
ago, the Guides were working 
principally with drugs, as far as 
I could make out at the time. I 
don’t know whether this is the 
same organization or not, but just 

21 



lately — the last year or so — 
I’ve been hearing gossip about 
them again.” 

“What kind of gossip?” 

«WELL, YOU know a good 
" many of the people who 
come into this Center for therapy 
are interested in metaphysics in 
one way or another,” Henry ex- 
plained. “Some of them have 
been telling me lately that the 
Guides are the latest thing in a 
True Group. And a True Group, 
in their language, means chiefly 
that the people in it have some 
honest - to - goodness supernatural 
abilities and powers!” 

He grimaced unhappily. “An- 
other characteristic is that no- 
body else knows exactly who be- 
longs to a True Group. In that 
way, your acquaintances seem to 
be living up to the legend.” 

Commager said he’d been un- 
der the impression that the 
Guides dealt in parapsychology. 

Henry nodded. “Well, they’d 
use that, too, of course! Depend- 
ing on the class of client — ” He 
hesitated briefly. “By and large, 
I’d say the Guides were a very 
good outfit for fairly normal citi- 
zens like you and the Boharts to 
stay away from!” 

He’d also heard of the Rever- 
end Wilson Knox and of the 
Temple of Antique Christianity, 
though not favorably. 

“Knox has a crummy little sect 



back in one of the Hollywood 
canyons. They go in for Greek 
paganism. Strictly a screwball 
group.” He didn’t know anything 
of the Parapsychological Group 
of Long Beach. “You can’t keep 
up with all of them.” 

IV 

J ULIUS SAVAGE was a lanky, 
sun-browned hypnotist who’d 
sometimes gone spear-fishing 
with Commager. On one such 
occasion — the last, if Julius had 
anything to say about it — Com- 
mager had been obliged to haul 
him half-drowned out of a kelp 
bed and thump him back into 
consciousness. Which made him 
the right man right now. 

He clasped his hands behind 
his head, rocked himself back 
from his desk and looked first 
interested and then highly dubi- 
ous, while Commager went on 
talking. 

“You’re about as lousy a hyp- 
notic subject as I am myself, 
Alan!” Julius protested finally. “I 
tried to put you under twice, re- 
member? Anyway, how about 
sending you to my tame M.D. 
for a check-up first? Amnesia 
isn’t anything to — No?” He 
considered. “Well, how long ago 
did this happen?” 

The fact that it had happened 
only the night before reassured 
him somewhat. So presently

Commager was sitting in an arm- 
chair being informed that his 
eyelids were getting heavier and 
heavier. 

An hour later, Julius said dis- 
couragedly, “This isn’t getting us 
anywhere and I’ve got another 
appointment at two o’clock! How 
bad do you want that informa- 
tion, Alan?” 

“It’s a matter of life and 
death!” 

“Oh, hell!” said Julius. He 
went out of the room and came 
back with a small bottle, partly 
filled with a slightly oily, aro- 
matic liquid. “I don’t use this 
often, but — By the way, with 
the possible exception of last 
night, did anyone else ever try 
to hypnotize you?” 

“Ira Bohart did, the first time 
I met him,” Commager recalled. 
“It was at a party. No results.” 

“We’ll make it two spoonfuls,” 
Julius decided. 

nPEN MINUTES later, Com- 
mager got into the black- 
ness. The next time he conscious- 
ly opened his eyes, it was past 
three in the afternoon. Julius, 
looking pale and exhausted, stood 
at the desk watching him. He’d 
loosened his tie and hung his 
jacket over the back of a chair. 
His hair was disheveled. 

“Brother!” he remarked. “Well, 
we got something, Alan. I’ll play 
parts of it back to you.” He 



jerked his head at a gently burbl- 
ing percolator on a mantel. “Cup 
of coffee there for you. Better 
have some.” 

Commager sipped black coffee, 
yawned, and took note of the 
time. Too much of the day al- 
ready was past, he thought un- 
easily; he wondered what the 
Guides had been doing mean- 
while. “What happened to your 
appointments?” n 

“Canceled them,” Julius said, 
fiddling with the tape recorder. 
“They’ll keep.” He glanced 
around at Commager. “Here’s the 
first thing we got. Chronological- 
ly, it seems to fit in at the end 
of the period you can’t remem- 
ber. Symbolism, but I’m curious. 
We’ll try it first.” 

Commager listened. After a 
while, there were pricklings of 
memory. When Julius stopped 
the recorder, he remarked, “I had 
a dream this morning that seems 
to tie in with that.” 

“Ah?” Julius looked profession- 
ally cautious. “Well, let’s hear 
about it.” 

Commager hesitated. The 
dream seemed irrelevant and 
rather childish, like a fairy tale. 
He’d been flying around in a 
great open space, he began at 
last. And he’d been wondering 
why nobody else was up there 
with him, but he hadn’t felt par- 
ticularly concerned about it. 
Then a hawk came swooping at 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



23 



him, trying to knock him out of 
the air. 

There was a long leash at- 
tached to the hawk’s leg and 
Commager noticed that, far down 
below, a number of people were 
holding the leash and watching 
the battle. “That explained why 
there wasn’t anyone else around, 
you see. When anyone tried it, 
they simply sent a hawk up after 
him.” 

“Hm!” said Julius. “Recognize 
the people?” 

“No ” Commager checked 

himself and laughed. “Of course, 
it just struck me! Hawkes was 
the name of one of the people I 
met last night! That explains the 
dream!” 

Julius nodded doubtfully. “Pos- 
sibly. How did it continue?” 

AS COMMAGER recalled it, 
there hadn’t been much more 
to it. He couldn’t damage the 
hawk and the hawk couldn’t bring 
him down; finally it disappeared. 
Then he’d been up there alone 
. and then he’d been wakened 
by the telephone. 

Julius tapped the desk with 
the eraser end of a pencil, looking 
thoughtful. “Well — ” he sighed. 
He turned to the recorder. “Let’s 
try another part of this now, Alan. 
The central part. Incidentally, 
we didn’t get into what you were 
actually doing last night. These 
are your subjective impressions 

24 



and they aren’t necessarily an 
immediately recognizable reflec- 
tion of real events, past or pres- 
ent. You understand that?” 

Commager said he did. But he 
felt- a stab of sharp apprehension. 
He was reasonably certain that 
whatever Julius heard or guessed 
in his office remained a private 
matter. But his own line of action 
had been based on the solid per- 
sonal conviction that, whatever 
had happened last night, it hadn’t 
been he who had killed Ruth 
MacDonald. 

In view of the hypnotist’s care- 
ful and almost formal phrasing, 
Commager was, for a few mo- 
ments at least, not quite so sure 
about that. 

They were a bad few mo- 
ments. .' 

Then the recorder was turn- 
ing again. 

?? W HAT DO you make of 
’’ it?” Julius asked. “It will 
help me formulate my own 
opinion.” 

Commager shrugged. He still 
felt shaken, after the intermit- 
tent waves of grief, rage and re- 
morse that had pounded through 
him while a section of the tape 
rewound itself again — with a 
vividness and immediacy that 
dazed him, but still seemed 
rather unaccountable. After all, 
that had been over and done with 
almost four years ago! 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“It’s fairly obvious to me,” he 
said reluctantly. At least his voice 
sounded steady enough. “A few 
months before my wife died, I’d 
begun to get interested in the 
ESP experiments she was play- 
ing around with. You remember 
Lona was almost as bad that way 
as Ira Bohart.” 

He managed a brief, careful 
grin. “It annoyed me at first, but, 
of course, I didn’t let her know. 
I thought she’d drop it soon 
enough. When she didn’t, I de- 
cided I’d experiment on the quiet 
by myself. Actually, I was after 
information I could use to con- 
vince Lona she was wasting her 
time with that sort of thing — 
and then she’d have more time 
to spare for the kind of fun and 
games I was interested in.” 

Julius smiled faintly and 
nodded. 



me — and sometimes she would!” 
Commager smiled. “I was also, 
you see, keeping a list of the 
times these little experiments 
didn’t work out, and they often 
didn’t, at first. So that, when I 
told Lona about it finally, it 
would be obvious that the coin- 
cidences had been just that.” 

He hesitated. “I still think 
they were just that. But one day, 
it struck me I’d accumulated too 
many coincidences lately. It 
shook me.” 

“Did it stop your experimenta- 
tion?” Julius remained intent on 
his art work. 

“A few days later, it did,” Corm 
mager said. He discovered sud- 
denly that he was sweating. 
“Lona phoned me that afternoon 
that she was driving down to the 
beach to pick me up. After she 
hung up, I had a sudden positive 
feeling that if she drove her car 
that afternoon, she’d get killed! 
I almost called her back. But I 
decided I wasn’t going to turn 
into another Ira Bohart. As of 
then, I was quitting all this ESP 
business and so was Lona! When 
she got there, I’d tell her — ” 

The sweat was running down 
his face now. “Well, you know 
that part of it. Lona had a heart 
attack while driving, the doctors 
thought, and crashed and got 
killed.” He paused again, because 
his voice had begun to shake. “I 
don’t know why that got on there 



STARTED making lists of 
A coincidences,” Commager ex- 
plained. “Occasions when I’d tell 
myself Lona would be home at 
six, say, and she’d actually show 
up about that time. Or I’d decide 
what dress she’d select to wear 
next morning — ” 

“Predictions, generally?” Julius 
drew a precise little circle on the 
desk blotter with his pencil and 
studied it critically. 

“Yes. Or I’d put the idea into 
her head that she wanted to talk 
about some particular thing with 



THE TIES OF EARTH

— ” he nodded at the recorder 
— “except tnat last night was 
the hrst time since that I felt, 
even lor a minute, that something 
mignt be going on tnat couxdn t 
be explained in a perfectly nor- 
mal way!” 

CCnpHAT,” inquired Julius, 
“was while you were going 
through that peculiar set of exer- 
cises you were describing, wasn’t 
it? Alan, how long ago has it 
been, exactly, since your wife 
died?” 

“Not quite four years.” Com- 
mager drove back a surge of im- 
patience. “I suppose I’ve felt 
guilty enough about it ever since! 
But right now, Julius, I’m inter- 
ested in finding out why I lost a 
few hours of memory last night 
and how to restore them. Are we 
getting any closer to that?” 

“I think we are. Can you be 
at this office at 10 a.m. two days 
from tomorrow? That’s Thursday 
morning — ” 

“Why should I come here 
then?” 

Julius shrugged. “Because 
that’s the earliest appointment I 
could make for you with Dr. 
Ciardi. I phoned him just before 
you woke up. He’s a friend of 
mine and an excellent psychia- 
trist, Alan. We do a lot of work 
together.” 

Commager said in angry 
amazement, “Damn you, Julius! 



I told you I didn’t want anyone 
else to know about this!” 

“I know,” Julius admitted un- 
happily. “We’ve been fairly good 
friends for about eight years 
now, haven’t we? We’ve been in 
and out of each other’s homes 
and met each other’s acquaint- 
ances, right?” 

Commager’s fingertips drum- 
med on his right knee. He was 
still furious. “So what?” 

“So hell, Alan! What you 
were telling me just now never 
happened! Your wife wasn’t 
killed in an auto- accident four 
years ago because, four years ago, 
you didn’t have a wife! To the 
best of my knowledge, you’ve 
never been married!” 

V 

|^OMMAGER had a rather 
early dinner at Tilford’s. A 
mirror lined the entire wall on 
the opposite side of the room; 
now and then, he glanced at him- 
self. For a sort of lunatic, he 
thought, the big, sun-tanned man 
sitting there looked remarkably 
calm and healthy. 

He was still amazed, above all, 
at the apparent instantaneous- 
ness with which he had realized 
that what Julius had blurted out 
was true! He could picture Lona 
in a hundred different ways, very 
vividly, but he couldn’t actually 
recall having ever mentioned her 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to anybody else! And he couldn’t 
now remember a single time 
when he and she and any other 
person had been together. 

It was almost as if the entire 
episode of Lona had been a story 
somebody had told him, illus- 
trated out of his own imaginings. 
And now, in a few hours, the story 
was beginning to fade out. Spe- 
cific scenes had dropped almost 
beyond the reach of memory. 
The image of Lona herself start- 
ed to blur. 

H IS immediate reaction had 
been an odd mixture of 
shocked self-disgust and profound 
relief, threaded with the feeling 
that actually he’d always known, 
without being consciously aware 
of it, that there wasn’t any real 
Lona. 

Even the emptions he’d felt 
while listening to the tape re- 
corder were a part of the fabrica- 
tion; almost at the instant of 
realization, they began to break 
away from him. Like the sudden 
shattering of a hard shell of alien 
matter, Commager thought, 
which he’d been dragging around, 
rather like a hermit-crab, under 
the pretense that it was a natural 
part of himself. The self-disgust 
became even more pronounced at 
that comparison. 

But whatever his original mo- 
tives had been for imposing that 
monstrous construction upon his 



mind, Commager couldn’t see any 
further connection between it and 
the events of the past night. 

Apparently he had thrust him- 
self into a period of amnesia to 
avoid the full impact of an artifU 
cial set of emotions. In that 
period, there had been a very 
real and very unpleasant occur- 
rence — a murder. 

His main reason now for re- 
maining convinced that he hadn’t 
been the murderer was that the 
evening papers carried no indi- 
cation that the body of Ruth 
MacDonald had been found. 

Which certainly indicated 
guilt on the part of those who 
must have found her. 

He could afford to wait until 
Thursday, Commager decided, to 
go digging after the causes of his 
delusion under Dr. Ciardi’s guid- 
ance. But he probably couldn’t 
afford to wait at all to find out 
what the Guides — he still had 
to assume it was the Guides — 
were preparing for him next. 

And perhaps the best way to 
find out would be, quite simply, 
to ask. 

TTE FINISHED his dinner, 
walked up the street to a 
telephone booth and dialed the 
number of Herbert Hawkes’s 
home. A man’s voice informed 
him presently that it was the 
Hawkes residence, Lex Barthold 
speaking. 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



27 



That, Commager recalled, was 
the name of the blond young man 
who had been an untalkative 
member of the party last night. 
He gave his own name and said 
he was trying to contact Miss 
Paylar — a piece of information 
which produced a silence of sev- 
eral seconds at the other end. 
But when Barthold spoke again, 
he sounded unshaken. 

“Paylar isn’t in at the moment. 
Shall I take your message, Mr. 
Commager?” 

Commager said no, he’d try 
again, and hung up. Now that, he 
reflected, walking back to his car, 
seemed to be an interesting sort 
of household! 

For the first time since leaving 
Julius’s office, he wasn’t too dis- 
pleased with himself. If he saw 
Paylar alone, he might, as far as 
appearances went, be taking an 
interest in the well-being of Ira 
Bohart or, reasonably enough, in 
Paylar herself. 

And things could start devel- 
oping from that point. 

Of course, she might avoid let- 
ting him see her alone. In any 
case, his call would give them 
something new to consider. 

He drove to the beach and 
turned south toward San Diego. 
A half hour later, he parked be- 
fore the cabin where, among 
bulkier items of fishing gear, he 
kept a 45-caliber revolver. He 
put that in the glove compart- 

28 



ment of the car and started back 
to town. 

T HE TELEPHONE rang a 
few minutes after he reached 
his apartment. 

“I’ve called you twice in the 
last hour,” Paylar said. “I under- i 
stand you want to speak to me.” 

“I do,” said Commager. “Do 
you happen to have the evening 
free?” 

She laughed. “I’ve arranged to 
have it free. You can meet me 
at your aquarium store, Mr. 
Commager.” 

“Eh?” he said stupidly. 

“At your store.” Her voice still 
sounded amused. “You see; I may 
have a business proposition for 
you.” 

Then the line went dead. 
Commager swore and hung up. 
When he turned into Wilshire 
Boulevard not very many min- 
utes later, he saw a long gray 
car, vague under the street lights, 
move away from the curb a hun- 
dred feet or so beyond his store 
and drive off. There was no sign 
of Paylar. 

He parked and followed the 
car thoughtfully with his eyes. 

Then he got out. The store was 
locked, the interior dark. But in 
back of the office, behind the 
partition, was a shimmering of 
light. 

He thought of the gun in his 
car. There had been one murder. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It seemed a little early for an- 
other one. 

He unlocked the door and 
locked it again behind him. This 
time, there were no bodies lying 
around the aisles. But at the back 
of the store, standing before a 
lighted fish tank and looking into 
it, Paylar was waiting for him. 

H E DIDN’T ask her how she 
got in. It seemed a theatri- 
cal gesture, a boasting indication 
that his affairs could be easily 
invaded from without. Aside from 
that, the darkened store undoubt- 
edly was a nice place for an 
ambush. Commager wondered 
briefly why he didn’t feel more 
concerned about that and real- 
ized then that he was enormously 
angry. ' An ambush might have 
been a relief. 

“Did you find out much about 
us today?” Paylar asked. 

“Not enough,” he admitted. 
“Perhaps you can tell me more.” 
“That’s why I’m here.” 
Commager looked at her skep- 
tically. She was wearing a black 
sweater and slacks that appeared 
wine-colored in the inadequate 
light from the big tank. A small, 
finely shaped body and a small, 
vivid face. The mouth smiled 
soberly; black eyes gleamed like 
an animal’s as she turned her 
head toward him. 

“We’re an organization,” she 
said, “that operates against the 



development of parapsychologi- 
cal abilities in human beings. .” 
Oddly enough, it made sense 
and he found himself believing 
her. Then he laughed. “Do you 
object to my winning a crap 
game?” 

Paylar said seriously, “We 
don’t object to that. But you’re 
not stopping there, Mr. Com- 
mager.” 

Again there was an instant of 
inner agreement; an elation and 
anxiety. Commager hesitated, 

startled by his reaction. He said, 
“I’m not aware of any ambition 
along that line.” 

She shook her head. “I don’t 
think you’re being quite truthful. 
But it doesn’t really matter how 
aware you are of it just now. The 
last twenty-four hours have indi- 
cated clearly that you can’t be 
checked by any ordinary 

methods.” She frowned. “The pos- 
sibility had been foreseen — and 
so we hit you with everything 
that was immediately available, 
Mr. Commager. I was sure it was 
enough.” 

Commager felt a little bewild- 
ered. “Enough for what?” 

“Why, almost anybody else 
would have done something sen- 
sible — and then refused to ever 
budge out of the everyday world 
again, even in his thoughts. In- 
stead, you turned around and 
started to smoke us out — which, 
incidentally, saved you for the 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



29 




moment from an even more un- 
nerving experience!” 

C OMMAGER stared at her, 
appalled. That final comment 
had no present meaning for him, 
but she obviously was speaking 
about a murder of which she, at 
the very least, had known at the 
time. She considered it mildly 
amusing that it had back-fired on 
them! 

He said harshly, “I’d enjoy 
breaking your neck. But I suspect 
that you’re a little crazy.” 

She shrugged, smiling, “The 



trouble is that you’re not going 
to go on thinking that, Mr. Com- 
mager. If you did, we could safe- 
ly disregard you.” 

He looked down at his hands. 
“So what are you going to do?” 
“There are others who say you 
can be stopped. It’s certain you 
won’t like their methods, though 
I’m not entirely sure they will 
be effective. I came here tonight 
to offer you an alternative.” 

“Go ahead and offer it.” 

“You can join us,” she said. 
Commager gave a short laugh 
of sheer astonishment. “Now why 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 





should I want to do that?” 

“In the end,” Paylar said sober- 
ly, “you may have very little 
choice! But there’s another rea- 
son. You’ve been trying, all your 
life, to bring your abilities into 
your consciousness and under 
your control.” 

He shook his head. “If you 
mean wild talents, I haven’t done 
anything of the sort.” 

“Unfortunately,” she said, “you 
won't remain unaware of that 
trend in yourself very much long- 
«'i Anil, if you cooperate with us, 
we can and will help you to do 



just that. But we can’t let you 
continue by yourself, without 
safeguards. You’re too likely to 
be successful, you see. Those 
wild talents can become extreme- 
ly wild!” 

“You know,” he said, almost 
good-humoredly, “I think you 
really believe what you say. But 
as far as I’m concerned, you’re 
a group of criminal lunatics with- 
out any more secret ability than 
I have myself — ” 

“That,” Paylar replied undis- 
turbed, “is precisely what we’re 
afraid of. For the time being, 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



31 







though, we can use our abilities 
in ways that you cannot. What 
happened while you were doing 
those exercises last night, Mr. 
Commager?” 

He looked at her and then 
away. “I got rather bored.” 

TJAYLAR laughed. “You’re ly- 
ing! Exercises of that kind 
provide very convincing illusions, 
and very little else, for people 
who are hungry for illusion. But 
since you have an ability, it took 
no more than a word to bring it 
into action! That was when we 
knew you had to be stopped. 
However, I’m afraid you’re still 
turning down my offer.” 

“You read my mind that time, 
lady! I’d turn you over to the 
police, too, if I thought it would 
do any good.” 

“It wouldn’t,” she assured him. 
Her head tilted a moment, with 
soft grace, into an attitude of 
listening. “I think my car is com- 
ing back for me. I’ll leave that 
offer open, Mr. Commager — in 
case you survive long enough 
now to except it!” 

He grinned. “You shouldn’t 
frighten me like that.” 

“I’ve frightened you a little, 
but not nearly enough. But there 
is more than one way to shake 
a man to his senses — or out of 
them — so perhaps we can still 
change your mind. Would you 
let me out the front door now?” 

32 



Lights slid over the ceiling 
above her as she spoke, and the 
long gray car, its engine throb- 
bing, stood at the curb when they 
came out. Paylar turned at the 
car door. 

“You know where I’m stay- 
ing,” she said, looking up at him, 
“if you want to find me.” 

Commager nodded. 

She smiled and then the door 
opened for her and light briefly 
filled the interior of the car. 

Seconds later, he stood staring 
after it as it fled down the street. 
She’d been right about there be- 
ing more than one way of shak- 
ing a man out of his senses. 

The driver of the car — the 
very much alive driver — had 
been Ruth MacDonald! 

T TNDER WHAT wasn’t quite 
a full Moon tonight, the Bay 
would have looked artificial if it 
hadn’t been so huge. A savage, 
wild place, incongruous in this 
area with the slow thump and 
swirl and thunder of the tide. 

A mile to the south was a 
cluster of cottages down near the 
water’s edge. Commager’s cabin 
was as close as anything could 
have been built to the flank of 
the big northern drop-off. He 
could look down at the sharp 
turn of the highway below him 
or out at the Bay. Nobody yet 
had tried to build on the rocky 
rises of ground behind him. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Without ordinary distractions, 
it was a good place for a few 
hours of painstaking reorienta- 
tion. He wasn’t exactly fright- 
ened, Commager told himself. 
But when he had recognized 
Ruth MacDonald, a wave of un- 
reason inside him had seemed to 
rise to meet and merge with the 
greater wave of unreason rolling 
in from a shadow-world without. 
For that moment, the rules of 
reality had flickered out of 
existence. 

An instant later, he’d had them 
solidly re-established. He was 
now simply a man who knew 
something had happened that he 
couldn’t begin to explain ration- 
ally. It was a much more accepta- 
ble situation, since it included 
the obvious explanation of irra- 
tionality. 

On Thursday morning, he 
could tell Dr. Ciardi, “Look, Doc, 
I’m having hallucinations. The 
last one was a honey. I thought 
I was carrying a dead woman 
all over town! What do we do 
about it?” 

And they’d do whatever was 
done in such circumstances and 
it would be a sane, normal, active 
life for Alan Commager forever 
after — with a woman more or 
less like Jean Bohart to live it 
with, which would keep out the 
shadowy Lonas. With everything, 
in fact, that didn’t fit-, into that 
kind of life, that belonged to the 



shadow-worlds, as completely 
obliterated and forgotten as they 
could become. 

Commager wondered what 
made that picture look so unsat- 
isfactory. 

I T STRUCK him suddenly 
that, according to Paylar, this 
was exactly how the Guides had 
expected him to react as soon as 
her little games had steered him 
into a bout of amnesia and hallu- 
cinations. They’d wanted, she’d 
said, in approximately those 
words, to put him in a frame of 
mind that would make him re- 
fuse to ever budge out of the 
safe, everyday world again, even 
in his thoughts. 

Commager grimaced. But 
they’d become convinced then 
that he wasn’t going to do it! 

He might do it all the same, 
he thought. But the reason it 
couldn’t be a completely satis- 
factory solution was growing 
clear. One couldn’t discount the 
probability that there was a little 
more to the shadow-worlds than 
lunacy and shadow. Perhaps only 
a very little more and perhaps 
not. But if he avoided looking at 
what was there, he would never 
find out. 

And then he realized that he 
wasn’t going to avoid looking at 
it, hadn’t really been seriously 
considering it. He swore at him- 
self, because avoidance did seem 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



33 



still the simple and rational solu- 
tion, providing one could be satis- 
fied with it. 

He couldn’t be satisfied with 
it and that was that. He could 
see now that if an organization 
such as Paylar had described the 
Guides to be existed, and if it 
were composed, at least in part, 
of people who really had devel- 
oped an understanding and work- 
ing knowledge of the possibilities 
of psi, it would be in a uniquely 
favorable position to control and 
check the development of similar 
abilities in others. 

Its connections and its influ- 
ence would be primarily with 
the psychological fringe groups 
here and with their analogs else- 
where; and the people wfio were 
drawn to such groups would be 
those who were dissatisfied with 
or incompetent in normal lines 
of activity, and had become ab- 
normally interested in compen- 
sating for their lack of other 
achievement by investigating the 
shadowy, vague, ego-bolstering 
promise of psi. 

And people frightened by the 
threat of total war, driven into 
a search for psychic refuge by 
the prospect of physical destruc- 
tion. 

In either case, because they 
were uncertain, less than norm- 
ally capable people, they could 
be controlled without too much 
difficulty — and carefully divert- 

34 



ed then, in groups or as individ- 
uals, from the thing they were 
seeking and might stumble upon! 

The exercises she’d demon- 
strated to him, Paylar had said, 
were designed primarily to pro- 
vide convincing illusions for those 
who were hungry for illusion. 

CHE AND her associates, Com- 
k -' mager realized, might feel it 
was necessary. They might know 
just enough to be afraid of what 
such knowledge could lead to. If 
it were possible to encourage a 
pair of dice to bounce and spin 
in just the right pattern to win 
for you, it might, for example, 
also be possible to send a few 
buildings bouncing and spinning 
through a city! Of course, nobody 
ever seemed to have done it, but 
that might be due precisely to 
the existence of some controlling 
agency, such as the Guides 
claimed to be. 

For a while, Commager re- 
garded the possibility of accept- 
ing Paylar’s invitation to join 
her group — and, a few seconds 
later, he knew he wasn’t going to 
do that either! 

However determined he might 
be to proceed with a painstaking 
and thorough investigation of 
this field of possibilities now, 
there was still a feeling of some- 
thing completely preposterous 
about the entire business. 

He could accept the fact that 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he had been shaken up mentally 
to the point where he might 
qualify without too much diffi- 
culty for the nearest insane asy- 
lum. But he wasn’t ready to admit 
to anybody just yet that he, a 
grown man, was taking the mat- 
ter of psi very seriously. 

It was something you could try 
out for yourself, just as an experi- 
ment, behind locked doors and 
with the windows shaded. 

So Commager locked the front 
door to his cabin and tried it out. 

VI 

T HE TELEGRAM which had 
been shoved under his apart- 
ment door during the night gave 
a Hollywood telephone number 
and urgently requested him to 
call it. It was signed by Elaine 
Lovelock. So far as Commager 
could remember, Elaine was no 
one he knew. When he dialed the 
number, nobody answered. 

He’d try tp reach her again 
before he left for the store, he 
decided. It was eight-thirty now; 
he’d just got in from the Bay. 
The chances were somebody’s de 
luxe fifty-gallon tropical fish tank 
had started to leak on the living 
room carpet, and it hadn’t oc- 
curred to them immediately that 
this was what pails and pots 
were for. 

He sat down to write a few 
notes on last night’s experiment. 



Nothing very striking had hap- 
pened; he suspected he’d simply 
fallen asleep after the first forty 
minutes or so. But if he kept 
notes, something like a recogniz- 
able pattern might develop. 

Item : The “Lona complex” 

hadn’t bothered him much. It 
was beginning to feel like some- 
thing that had happened to some- 
body else a long time ago. So 
perhaps the emotions connected 
with it hadn’t been triggered by 
Paylar’s exercises, as Julius 
seemed to assume. Or else, since 
he no longer believed in it, it 
was on its way out as a complex 

— he hoped. 

Item : With his eyes closed, he 
could imagine very easily that 
he was looking through the wall 
of the room into another section 
of the cabin; also that he had 
moved there in person, as a form 
of awareness. In fact, he had 
roamed happily all around the 
Bay area for about ten minutes. 
For the present, that proved only 
that he had a much more vivid 
imagination than he’d thought — 
though whoever created Lona 
could be assumed to have con- 
siderable hidden talent along that 
line! 

Item: When he’d tried to 

“read” specific pages of a closed 
book lying on a table near him, 
he had failed completely. 

Item: He had run suddenly 

— he might have been asleep by 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



35 



then — into successive waves of 
unexplained panic, which brought 
him upright in his chair with his 
pulses hammering wildly. 

Item-. The panic had faded 
out of reach the instant he began 
to investigate it and he hadn’t 
been able to recall it. 

Item-. Either shortly before or 
after that event, he’d had for a 
while the sensation of being the 
target of stealthy and malevolent 
observation. He had made an 
attempt to “locate” the observer 
and gained the impression that 
the other one unhurriedly with- 
drew. 

Item-. Briefly, he’d had a feel- 
ing of floating up near the cfeiling 
of the room, watching his own 
body sitting in the armchair with 
its eyes closed. This had rocked 
him hard enough to awaken him 
again and he had concluded the 
experiments. 

Item : After waking up, he 

hadn’t found or imagined he’d 
found Ruth MacDonald or any- 
body else lying around the cabin, 
murdered or otherwise. He’d 
checked. 

And that about summed it up, 
Commager decided.- Not very 
positive results, but he was de- 
termined to continue the experi- 
ments. 

He suspected Julius would 
feel very dubious about all this; 
but Julius wasn’t going to be 
informed. 

36 



He himself was in a remark- 
ably cheerful mood this morning. 

M RS. LOVELOCK had a mag- 
nificent, musical voice, rath- 
er deep for a woman. 

“I’m so glad you called again, 
Mr. Commager,” she said. “I was 
away on ^n unavoidable errand. 
Dr. Knox needs to see you imme- 
diately! How soon can you be 
here?” 

“Dr. Knox?” Commager re- 
peated. “Do you mean the Rev- 
erend Wilson Knox?” 

“That is correct. Do you have 
the address of our Temple?” 
Commager said he didn’t. 
There was no immediate reason 
to add that he hadn’t the slight- 
est intention of going there, 
either. “What did he want to see 
me about?” 

Mrs. Lovelock hesitated. “I 
couldn’t explain it satisfactorily 
by telephone, Mr. Commager.” A 
trace of anxiety came into her 
voice. “But it’s quite urgent!” 
Commager said he was sorry; 
he had a very full business day 
ahead of him — which was true 
— so, unless he could get some 
indication of what this was all 
about — 

The melodious voice told him 
quaveringly, “Dr. Knox had a 
serious heart attack last night. He 
needs your help!” 

Commager scowled. She sound- 
ed as off-beat as the rest of them 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and he had an urgent impulse 
to hang up. 

He said instead, “I don’t quite 
see how I could be of much help 
under those circumstances. I’m 
not a doctor, you know.” 

“I do know that, Mr. Com- 
mager,” Mrs. Lovelock replied. 
“I also know that you haven’t 
been acquainted with Dr. Knox 
for more than a few days. But I 
assure you that you may be sav- 
ing a human life by coming out 
here immediately! And that is all 
I can tell you now — ” 

She stopped short, sounding as 
if she were about to burst into 
tears. 

What she said didn’t make 
sense. Also Commager hadn’t 
liked the Reverend Knox, quite 
aside from the company he kept. 
But he could, he supposed re- 
signedly, afford to waste a few 
more hours now. 

“What was that address?” he 
asked, trying not to sound too 
ungracious about it. 

/ k N THE way over, he had 
time to wonder whether this 
mightn’t be part of some new 
little game the Guides wanted to 
play with him. He was inclined 
to discount Paylar’s threats — 
psychologically, he suspected, 
they’d already tried everything 
they could do to him — and they 
didn’t look like people who would 
resort readily to physical vio- 



lence, though Hawkes could be 
an exception there. 

When Commager came in sight 
of the Temple of Antique Chris- 
tianity, physical violence sudden- 
ly looked a little more likely. He 
stopped a moment to consider 
the place. 

It was in a back canyon be- 
yond Laurel; the last quarter- 
mile had been a private road. A 
tall iron gate blocked the road 
at this point, opening into a 
walled court with a small build- 
ing to the right. A sign over a 
door in the building indicated 
that this was the office. 

Some distance back, looming 
over the walls of the court and 
a few intervening trees, was an- 
other structure, an old white 
building in the Spanish style, the 
size of a small hotel. 

It looked like the right kind 
of setting for the kind of screw- 
ball cult Henry Warbutt had de- 
scribed. Depending on who was 
around, it also looked like a 
rather good place for murder or 
mayhem. 

Should he just stroll in care- 
lessly like a big, brave, athletic 
man? Or should he be a dirty 
coward and get his revolver out 
of the glove compartment? It 
was bound to make an unsightly 
bulge in any of his jacket pock- 
ets — 

He decided to be a dirty 
coward. 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



37 



T HE GATE was locked, but 
the lock clicked open a few 
seconds after Commager pushed 
a buzzer button beside it. The 
only visible way into the area 
was through the office door, so he 
went inside. 

A pallid young man and a 
dark, intense - looking young 
woman sat at desks across the 
room from the door. The young 
man told Commager he was ex- 
pected and went to a side door 
of the office with him, from where 
he pointed to an entrance into 
the big building, on the other end 
of what he called the grove. 

“Mrs. Lovelock is waiting for 
you there,” he said and went 
back to his desk. 

The grove had the reflective 
and well-preserved air of a sec- 
tion of an exclusive cemetery, 
with just enough trees growing 
around to justify its name. There 
was a large, square lawn in the 
center, and a large, chaste bronze 
statue stood at each corner of 
the lawn, gazing upon it. 

Back among trees to the left 
was a flat, raised platform, ap- 
parently faced with gray and 
black marble, but otherwise fea- 
tureless. Commager had just 
gone past this when he realized 
that somebody had been watch- 
ing him from the top of the plat- 
form as he passed. 

That, at any rate, was the feel- 
ing he got. He hadn’t actually 

38 



seen anyone, and when he looked 
back, there was nobody there. 
But the feeling not only had been 
a definite and certain one — it 
resumed the instant he started 
walking on again. This time, he 
didn’t look back. 

Before he’d gone a dozen more 
steps, he knew, too, just when 
he’d experienced that exact sen- 
sation before. It was the previous 
night, while he was doing his 
parapsychological experiments at 
the Bay and had suddenly felt 
that he was under secret and un- 
friendly scrutiny. 

He laughed at himself, but the 
impression remained a remark- 
ably vivid one. And before he 
reached the entrance to the main 
building which the young man in 
the office had indicated to him, 
he had time for the thought that 
playing with the imagination, as 
he was doing, might leave one 
eventually on very shaky ground. 

Then he was there, looking in- 
to a long hallway, and Mrs. Love- 
lock’s fine, deep voice greeted 
him before he caught sight of 
her. 

“I’m so glad you could come, 
Mr. Commager!” she said. 

S HE WAS standing in the door 
of a room that opened on the 
hall to the left, and Commager 
was a trifle startled by her ap- 
pearance. He had expected a 
large handsome woman of about 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



thirty, to match the voice. But 
Mrs. Lovelock was not only 
huge; she was shockingly ugly 
and probably almost twice the 
age he’d estimated. She wore a 
white uniform, so Commager 
asked whether she was Wilson 
Knox’s nurse. 

“I’ve been a registered nurse 
for nearly forty years, Mr. Com- 
mager,” the beautiful voice told 
him. “At present, I’m attending 
Dr. Knox. Would you come in 
here, please?” 

He followed her into the room 
and she closed the door behind 
them. Her big, gray face, Com- 
mager decided, looked both wor- 
ried and very angry. 

“The reason I wasn’t more 
open with you over the tele- 
phone,” she told him, “was that 
I was certain you wouldn’t have 
taken the trouble to drive out 
here if I had been. And I couldn’t 
have blamed you! Won’t you sit 
down, please?” 

Commager took a chair and 
said he was afraid he didn’t un- 
derstand. 

Mrs. Lovelock nodded. “I shall 
give you the facts. Dr. Knox had 
a very severe heart attack at 
around two o’clock this morning. 
I have been a member of his con- 
gregation for twenty-four years, 
and I arrived with a doctor short- 
ly afterward. Dr. Knox is resting 
comfortably now, but he is very 
anxious to see you. I must let 



him tell you why, Mr. Commager. 
But I should like to prepare you 
for what you will hear — ” 

"l/TRS. LOVELOCK stared 
gloomily at the carpet for 
a moment and then her face 
twisted briefly into a grimace of 
pure rage. 

“Wilson — Dr. Knox — is a 
harmless old fool!” she told Com- 
mager savagely. “This Antique 
Christianity he worked out never 
hurt anybody. They prayed to 
Pan and they had their dances 
and chants. And there was the 
Oracle and he read out of the 
Book of Pan. » .” 

“I don’t know anything about 
Dr. Knox’s activities,” Commager 
said, not too politely. 

She had thick, reddened, cap- 
able hands and they were locked 
together now on her lap, the 
fingers twisting slowly against 
one another, as if she were trying 
to break something between 
them. 

“I was the Oracle, you see,” she 
explained. “I knew it was foolish, 
but I’d sit up there on the dais 
in the smoke, with a veil over my 
head, and I’d say whatever I 
happened to think of. But this 
year, Wilson brought in that Ruth 
MacDonald — you know her, he 
said.” 

“I’ve met the lady,” Commager 
admitted. “I wouldn’t say I know 
her.” 



THE TIES OF EARTH 



39 



“She became the Oracle! And 
then she began to change every- 
thing! I told Wilson he was quite 
right to resist that. There are 
things, Mr. Commager, that a 
good Christian simply must not 
do!” 

Which, Commager felt, was a 
remarkable statement, under the 
circumstances. Mrs. Lovelock 
came ponderously to her feet. 

“Dr. Knox will tell you what 
remains to be told,” she added 
rather primly. “And, of course, 
you cannot stay too long. Will 
you follow me now, please?” 

T HE REVEREND didn’t look 
as if he were in too bad a 
condition, Commager thought 
when he saw him first. He was 
lying in a hospital bed which had 
been raised high enough to let 
him gaze down at the grove out 
of a window of his second-story 
room. 

After he’d talked a few mo- 
ments, Commager felt the man 
was delirious and he thought 
briefly of calling back Mrs. Love- 
lock or the other nurse who had 
been with Wilson Knox when 
they came in. But those two un- 
doubtedly had been able to judge 
for themselves whether they 
should remain with the Reverend 
or not. 

“Why should they want to kill 
you?” Commager asked. Knox 
had been speaking of the Guides 



and then had started to weep; 
now he blew his nose on a piece 
of tissue and made a groping 
motion for Commager’s hand, 
which Commager withdrew in 
time. 

“It was merely a matter of 
business as far as I was con- 
cerned, Mr. Commager. I certain- 
ly had no intention of blocking 
any activities of the Guides. In 
fact, I should prefer not to know 
about them. But when Miss Mac- 
Donald, who was employed by 
the Temple, upset our members, 
I protested to her, sir! Isn’t that 
understandable?” 

“Entirely,” Commager agreed 
carefully. “What did Miss Mac- 
Donald do to upset them?” 

“She predicted two of the con- 
gregation would die before the 
end of the year,” Wilson Knox 
said shakily. “It caused a great 
deal of alarm. Many of our 
wealthier clients withdrew from 
the Temple at once. It is a con- 
siderable financial loss!” 

The Reverend appeared ra- 
tional enough on that point. 
Commager inquired, “Is Miss 
MacDonald one of the Guides, 
Dr. Knox?” 

“It’s not for me to say.” Knox 
gave him a suddenly wary look. 
“When she spoke to me by tele- 
phone last night, I asked whether 
I had offended anyone. I was, of 
course, greatly distressed!” His 
expression changed back to one 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of profound self-pity. “But she 
repeated only that it had become 
necessary for me to die this week 
and hung up.” 

I T SEEMED an odd way at 
that for the Temple’s new 
Oracle to have phrased her pre- 
diction, Commager thought. He 
regarded Dr. Knox without much 
sympathy. “So now you want me 
to simply tell her not to hurt 
you, eh?” 

“It would be better, Mr. Com- 
mager,” Knox suggested, “if you 
addressed yourself directly to the 
young woman called Paylar!” He 
reached for his visitor’s hand 
again. “I place myself under your 
protection, sir! I know you won’t 
refuse it!” 

Which was almost precisely 
what he had said as soon as the 
nurses left the room, and the 
reason Commager had believed 
the patient was in a state of de- 
lirium. Now it seemed more prob- 
able that he was merely badly 
mistaken. 

Commager decided not to ask 
why it would be better to speak 
to Paylar. At any direct question 
concerning the Guides, the Rev- 
erend became evasive. He said 
instead, “What made you decide 
I could protect you, Dr. Knox?” 
Knox looked downright crafty. 
“I have made no inquiries about 
you, sir, and I do not intend to. 
I am a simple man whose life has 



been devoted to providing a 
measure of beauty and solace for 
his fellow human beings. In a 
modest way, of course. I have 
never pried into the Greater 
Mysteries!” 

He seemed to expect approval 
for that, so Commager nodded 
gravely. 

“I speak only of what I saw,” 
Wilson Knox continued. “On Sun- 
day night, I saw them attempt to 
bring you directly under their 
sway. Forgive me for saying, sir, 
that they do not do this with an 
ordinary person! I also saw them 
fail and I knew they were fright- 
ened. Nevertheless, you were not 
destroyed.” 

He tapped Commager’s hand 
significantly. “That, sir, was 
enough for me. I do not attempt 
to pry — I have merely placed 
myself under your protection!” 

VII 

A MAN with Secret Powers, a 
man who could tell the 
Guides to go jump in the Pacific, 
might take a passing interest in 
the gimmicks of an organization 
like the Temple of Antique Chris- 
tianity. So on his way out through 
the grove, Commager had turned 
aside to get a closer look at the 
dais. 

He assumed, at least, that the 
gray and black marble platform 
was what Mrs. Lovelock had re- 



T H E TIES OF EARTH 



41 



ferred to as the seat of the Oracle, 
since nothing else around seemed 
suitable for the purpose. 

Standing before it, he pictured 
her sitting up there in the night, 
veiled, a vast, featureless bulk, 
announcing whatever came into 
her mind in that stunning voice, 
and he could see that Wilson 
Knox’s congregation might well 
have listened in pop-eyed fascina- 
tion. Ruth MacDonald couldn’t 
have been nearly as impressive. 



Perhaps that was why she had 
started passing out death sent- 
ences. 

Down on Sunset, he parked 
his car at the curb and remained 
in it, watching the traffic, while 
he tried to digest the information 
he had received — if you could 
call it information. 

Wilson Knox and Mrs. Love- 
lock appeared to be people who 
had fabricated so much fantastic 
garbage for the clients of the 




42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Temple that they had no judg- 
ment left to resist the fabrica- 
tions of others. 

Commager’s parting from Mrs. 
Lovelock had given him the im- 
pression that the huge woman 
also was sullenly afraid, though 
she hid it much better than the 
Reverend had. It could be simply 
that she felt her own position in 
the Temple would be lost if Knox 
died; but he thought that in her 
case, too, it was a more personal 



fear, of the Guides, or even of 
himself — 

And he’d practically promised 
both of them to put in a word 
with Paylar to protect that re- 
volting little man! 

XT OWEVER, the Reverend’s 
heart attack, at least, prob- 
ably had been a real enough 
thing. And if Ruth MacDonald 
actually had telephoned a pre- 
diction of death to him earlier 




THE TIES OF EARTH 



43 



in the night, there was some cause 
for intervention. The practice of 
frightening people into their 
graves was something that any- 
one could reasonably insist 
should be stopped! 

And that, of course, brought 
up the question of how he ex- 
pected to stop it. 

And the question, once more, 
of just what that odd group of 
people — who indicated they 
were the Guides or associated 
with them — was after. 

Ruth MacDonald’s activities 
concerning the Temple of An- 
tique Christianity hardly seemed 
to lie on the lofty, idealistic level 
he’d been almost willing to 
ascribe to them in theory, even 
if he disliked their methods. She 
was a brassy, modern young 
witch, Commager thought, using 
the old witchcraft tools of fear 
and suggestion out of equally old 
motives of material gain and 
prestige. 

But one couldn’t account for 
Hawkes as simply as that, be- 
cause Hawkes had had money 
and prestige. 

Commager knew least of all 
about Paylar, except for the 
young man called Lex Barthold, 
whose connection with the others 
wasn’t clear. The impression of 
Paylar was still mainly that she 
had a physical personality that 
would be hard to match if you 
liked them slender, dark and 

44 



mysterious, and with a self-assur- 
ance that wasn’t aggressive like 
Ruth MacDonald’s, but that 
might be a great more difficult 
to crack. Among the three he’d 
had to deal with, she seemed to 
be the leader, though that wasn’t 
necessarily true. 

He found himself walking 
slowly down the street toward a 
phone booth. 

Let’s make a game of it, he 
thought. Assume that what Pay- 
lar had said and what the 
Reverend had suspected was true 
— at least in the Guides’s own 
opinion — that he had turned out 
to be exceptionally tough material 
for their psychological gimmicks. 
That he had, in fact, abilities he 
didn’t yet know about himself, 
but which, even in a latent state, 
were sufficient to have got the 
Opposition all hot and worried! 

VEN IF the Guides only be- 
lieved that — if they, like 
Knox and his mountainous reg- 
istered nurse, had played around 
so long on the fringes of reality 
that they were as badly confused 
now as the people they’d been 
misleading — his intervention 
should still be effective! Particu- 
larly if he informed Mrs. Love- 
lock, with the proper degree of 
impressiveness, that he’d passed 
on the word. 

A little play-acting didn’t seem 
too much effort to put out to save 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a human life. Even a life like 
Wilson Knox’s . 

This time, it was Paylar who 
answered the telephone. 

“You’ve disappointed me a 
little, Mr. Commager,” she said. 
“When I first heard your voice, 
I was certain you were going to 
invite me out to dine and dance.” 
Commager assured her that 
this had been his primary pur- 
pose — and as soon as he’d said 
it, he began to wonder whether 
it wasn’t true. But business came 
first, he added. 

“Well, as to the business,” Pay- 
lar told him demurely, “I’m not 
necessarily in control of Ruth’s 
activities, you know. I hadn’t 
been informed that the Reverend 
Knox was ill.” She paused a mo- 
ment. “I’ll tell Ruth she isn’i» to 
frighten your friend again. Will 
that be satisfactory, Mr. Com- 
mager?” 

“Why, yes, it is,” Commager 
said and found himself flushing. 
Somehow, in her easy acceptance 
of his intervention, she’d man- 
aged to make him feel like a 
child whose fanciful notions were 
being humored by an adult. He 
put the idea aside, to be investi- 
gated later. “Now about where to 
have dinner — ” 

Paylar said she’d prefer to let 
him surprise her. “But I have a 
condition,” she added pleasantly. 
“There’ll be no shop-talk tonight!” 
Putting him on the defensive 



again, Commager thought rue- 
fully. He told her shop-talk had 
been far from his mind and 
would eight o’clock be about 
right? 

It would be about right, she 
agreed. And then, arriving at the 
store finally, some fifteen minutes 
later, he found Jean Bohart wait- 
ing in his office. 

“Hi, Alan,” she greeted him 
gloomily. “You’re taking me to 
lunch. Okay?” 

In one way and another, Com- 
mager felt, Tuesday simply didn’t 
look like a good day for business. 

??T’M IN A mood today,” Jean 

-*■ announced. She picked with- 
out enthusiasm at a grapefruit 
and watercress salad. “But you’re 
not talking to me, either!” 

“I was thinking,” Commager 
said, “that I was glad you didn’t 
look like a certain lady I met 
this morning. What’s the mood 
about?” 

She hesitated. “I’m making my 
mind up about something. I’ll 
tell you tomorrow. Who was the 
lady? Someone I know?” 

“I doubt it. A Mrs. Lovelock.” 

“I don’t know any Lovelocks. 
What’s the matter with her 
looks?” 

“Fat,” Commager explained. 

“Well,” Jean said glumly, “I’m 
not that.” 

She was, in fact, in spite of 
her downcast expression, a model 



THE TIES OF EARTH

of crisp attractiveness as usual. 
A white sharkskin suit, with a 
lavender veil gathered lightly at 
her throat, plus a trim white hat 
to one side of a blonde head — 
neat, alert and healthy-looking 
as an airline hostess, Commager 
thought approvingly. 

Jean mightn’t care for the com- 
parison, though, so he didn’t tell 
her. And he wasn’t going to press 
her about the mood. At the rare 
moments that she became re- 
served, probing made her sullen. 
Probably something to do with 
Ira again. 

“I called off the Taylors for 
tomorrow,” she told him sudden- 
ly, with some traces of embarrass- 
ment, “so we could talk. You 
don’t mind, do you?” 

“Of course not,” Commager 
said hesitantly. Then it struck 
him suddenly: they’d had a date 
for an all-day fishing party Wed- 
nesday, Jean and he and the Tay- 
lor couple. He’d forgotten com- 
pletely! 

“That’s all right then,” Jean 
said, looking down at her plate. 
She still seemed curiously shy 
and Commager realized that this 
was no ordinary problem. “Will 
you sleep at your cabin tonight?” 

“Sure,” he said, concerned — 
he was very fond of Jean. His 
sleeping at the cabin was the 
usual arrangement on such occa- 
sions; he’d have everything ready 
there for the day before anyone 

46 



else arrived and then they’d be 
off to an early start. 

“I’ll be there tomorrow at 
eight,” said Jean. She gave him 
a quick, unhappy smile. “I love 
you, Alan — you never ask ques- 
tions when you shouldn’t!” 

S O HE HAD two dates at eight 
now, twelve hours apart. If 
it hadn’t been for the attendant 
problems, Commager decided, 
his social life might have looked 
exceptionally well-rounded at the 
moment to almost anybody! 

But he didn’t seem to be doing 
a very good job qf keeping clear 
of attendant problems. It had 
struck him for the first time, while 
they were lunching, that Jean 
Bohart might easily have been 
the prototype of the figment of 
Lona. There were obvious gen- 
eral similarities, and the dissimi- 
larities might have been his own 
expression of the real-life fact 
that Jean was Ira’s wife. 

But he felt himself moving into 
a mentally foggy area at that 
point. There had been occasional 
light love-making between them, 
too light to really count; but 
Jean certainly had remained 
emotionally absorbed with Ira, 
though she tended to regard him 
superficially with a kind of fond 
exasperation. 

Commager didn’t really know 
how he felt about Jean, except 
that he liked her more than any- 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



one else he could think of. There 
was a warning awareness that if 
he tried to push any deeper into 
that particular fog right now, he 
might get himself emotionally 
snagged again. 

It didn’t seem advisable to be- 
come emotionally snagged. There 
were still too many other doubt- 
ful issues floating around. 

One of the other issues re- 
solved itself — in a way — very 



shortly, with the ringing of the 
office telephone. 

It was Elaine Lovelock once 
more. 

“Mr. Commager,” she said, 
“about the matter we were dis- 
cussing — ” 

He began to tell her he had 
spoken to Paylar, but she in- 
terrupted him: “Dr. Knox died 
an hour ago!”

THE SEMANTIC WAR 



Illustrated by WES 

Perhaps there have been causes 
for slaughter just as silly as 
this was — but try to find one! 



T HE RAIN pours down 
chill out of a sullen sky. 
My pace quickens as I 
try to regain the relative warmth 
and shelter of the cavern before 
I become thoroughly drenched. I 
cannot afford to catch a cold. 
All alone as I am and with no 
medicine, I would stand too great 
a chance of a quick death. These 
lowering Oregon skies still hold 
traces of nameless disease in their 
writhing cloud tendrils. I am not 



just afraid of a cold. That would 
only be the key for some other 
malady to use and strike me 
down forever. 

I see the cave up ahead and 
feel a sense of contentment as I 
draw near and then duck inside 
its stony mouth. The rain hisses 
without, but inside it is dry. There 
is a heavy cow-hide hanging on 
a peg in the wall and I take it 
down and wrap it around me. 
Soon I will be warm. Once more

I may stave off my ultimate end. 

Sometimes I wonder why I 
wish to put it off. Certainly, ac- 
cording to my old standards, 
there is no point in living. But 
somehow I feel that the mere 
fact of living is justification in 
itself. Even for such a life as 
mine. 

I didn’t always feel this way. 
But then circumstances change 
and people change with them. I 
changed my circumstances more 
than myself, but I had no alterna- 
tive. So now I exist. 

I suppose I should be content. 
After all, I am alive and, in my 
own simple way, I enjoy life. I 
can remember people who asked 
nothing more than to be allowed 
to live — to exist. Ironically 
enough, I always considered them 
sub-normal. I felt that a man 
should strive to do something 
that would not only perpetuate 
the happiness of his own life but 
that of his fellow-men. Some- 
thing that would make life more 
beautiful, and easier, and more 
kind. 

I T WAS with this feeling that 
I applied myself as a student 
of philosophy at Stanford Uni- 
versity. And the strengthening of 
this same belief led me to take 
up teaching and embrace it as 
the only way of obtaining genu- 
ine happiness. My personal phil- 
osophy was simple. I would learn 



about life in all its real and sym- 
bolic meanings and then teach it 
to my pupils, each of whom, I 
felt sure, were thirsting for the 
knowledge that I was extracting 
from my cultural environment. I 
would show them the meaning 
behind things. That, I felt, was 
the key to successful living. 

Now it seems strangely pathe- 
tic that I should have essayed 
such an impossible task. But even 
a professor of philosophy can be 
mistaken and become confused. 

I remember when I first be- 
came aware of the movement. 
For years, we had been drilling 
certain precepts into the soft, im- 
pressionable heads of those stu- 
dents who came under our influ- 
ence. Liberalism, some called it, 
the right to take the values 
accumulated by society over a 
period of hundreds of years and 
bend them to fit whatever idea 
or act was contemplated. By such 
methods, it was possible to fit 
the mores to the deed, not the 
deed to the mores. Oh, it was a 
wonderful theory, one that prom- 
ised to project all human activi- 
ties entirely beyond good and 
evil. 

However, I digress. It was a 
spring morning at Berkeley, Cali- 
fornia, when I had my first ink- 
ling of the movement. I was 
sitting in my office gazing out 
the window and considering life 
in my usual contemplative fash-

ion. I might say I was being 
rather smug. I was thinking how 
fortunate I was to have been 
graduated from Stanford with 
such high honors, and how my 
good luck had stayed with me 
until I received my doctor’s de- 
gree in a famous Eastern uni- 
versity and came out to take an 
associate professorship at the 
Berkeley campus. 

I was watching the hurrying 
figures below on the crosswalks 
and idly noting the brilliant green 
of the shrubbery and the trees 
and the lawn. I was mixing up 
Keats with a bit of philosophy 
and thoroughly enjoying myself. 
Knowledge is truth, truth beauty, 
I mused, that is all we know on 
Earth, and all we need to know. 

There was a knock on my door 
and I said come in, reluctantly 
abandoning my train of thought 
which had just picked up Shakes- 
peare, whom I was going to con- 
sider as two-thirds philosopher 
and one-third poet. I have never 
felt that the field of literature 
had the sole claim to Shakes- 
peare’s greatness. 

P ROFESSOR Lillick came in, 
visibly perturbed. Lillick was 
a somewhat erratic individual 
(for a professor, at least) and he 
was often perturbed. Once he be- 
came excited about the possibili- 
ties of the campus shrubbery 
being stunted and discolored by 



the actions of certain dogs living 
on campus. He was not a phil- 
osophy professor, of course, but 
a member of the political science 
group. 

“Carlson,” he asked nervously, 
“have you heard about it yet?” 

“I have no idea,” I returned 
good-naturedly. “Heard about 
what?” 

He looked behind him as if 
he thought he might be followed. 
Then he whirled around, his 
sharp-featured face alight with 
feeling. “Carlson — the Wistick 
dufels the Moraddy!” And he 
stared at me intently, his gimlet 
eyes almost blazing. 

I stared back at him blankly. 

“You haven’t heard!” he ex- 
claimed. “I thought surely you 
would know about it. You’re al- 
ways talking about freedom to 
apply thought for the good of 
humanity. Well, we’re finally go- 
ing to do something about it. 
You’ll see. Keep your ears open, 
Carlson.” Then he turned and 
started out of the room. He 
paused at the threshold and fixed 
me again with his ferretlike eyes. 
“The Wistick dufels the Morad- 
dy!” he said, and vanished 
through the door. 

And that was my first unheed- 
ed omen of what was to come. I 
paid little attention to it. Lillick 
wasn’t the sort of man who in- 
spired attention. As a matter of 
fact, I considered reporting him 



THE SEMANTIC WAR

to the head of his department as 
being on the verge of a nervous 
breakdown. But I didn’t. In those 
days, nervous breakdowns were 
a common occurrence around 
college campuses. The education- 
al profession was a very hazard- 
ous occupation. One Southern 
university, for example, reported 
five faculty suicides during spring 
quarter. 

TN THE days that followed, 

however, I began to realize 
that there was some sort of move- 
ment being fostered by the stu- 
dent body. It couldn’t be defined, 
but it could be felt and seen. The 
students began to form groups 
and hold meetings — often with- 
out official sanction. What they 
were about could not be discov- 
ered, but some of the results soon 
became evident. 

For one thing, certain students 
began to walk on one side of the 
street and the other students 
walked on the other side. The 
ones who used the north side of 
the street wore green sweaters 
with white trousers or skirts, and 
the south-side students wore 
white sweaters with green trou- 
sers or skirts. It even got to the 
point where those in green 
sweaters went only to classes in 
the morning and those in white 
attended the afternoon sessions. 

Then the little white cards be- 
gan to appear. They were sent 

52 



through the mail. They were 
slipped under doorways and in 
desk drawers. They turned up 
beside your plate at dinner and 
under your pillow at night. They 
were pasted on your front door 
in the morning and they ap- 
peared in the fly-leaves of your 
books. They were even hung on 
trees like fruit, and surely no 
fruit ever spored so queer a seed- 
ling. 

They said either one thing or 
the other: THE WISTICK 

DUFELS THE MORADDY, or 
THE MORADDY DUFELS 
THE WISTICK. Which card be- 
longed to what group was not 
immediately clear. It was not un- 
til the riots broke out that the 
thing began to be seen in its 
proper perspective. And then it 
was too late. 

When the first riot started, it 
was assumed that the university 
officials and the police could 
quell it in a very short time. But 
strangely enough, as additional 
police were called in, the battle 
raged even more fiercely. I could 
see part of the affair from my 
window and therefore was able 
to understand why the increas- 
ing police force only added to 
the turmoil. They were fighting 
one another! And through the din 
could be heard the wild shouts 
of “The Wistick dufels the 
Moraddy!” or “The Moraddy 
dufels the Wistick!” 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The final blow came when I 
saw the Registrar and the Dean 
of Men struggling fiercely in one 
of the hedge-rows, and heard the 
Dean of Men yell in wild exulta- 
tion as he brought a briefcase 
down on the Registrar’s head, 
“The Wistick dufels the Morad- 
dy!” 

Then someone broke in 
through the door of my office. I 
turned in alarm and saw a huge 
three-letter man standing only a 
few feet from me. He had been 
in one of my classes. I remem- 
bered something about his being 
the hardest driving fullback on 
the Pacific coast. He was cer- 
tainly the dumbest philosophy 
student I ever flunked. His hair 
was mussed and he was wild- 
eyed. He had blood on his face 
and chest, and his clothes were 
torn and grass-stained. 

“The Wistick dufels the 
Moraddy,” he said. 

“Get out of my office,” I told 
him coldly, “and stay out.” 

“So you’re on the other side,” 
he snarled. “I hoped you would 
be.” 

He started toward me and I 
seized a bookend on my desk 
and tried to strike him with it. 
But he brushed it aside and came 
on in. His first blow nearly broke 
my arm and as I dropped my 
guard due to the numbing pain, 
he struck me solidly on the side 
of the jaw. 



When I recovered conscious- 
ness, I was lying by the side of 
my desk where I had fallen. My 
head ached and my neck was 
stiff. I got painfully to my feet 
and then noticed the big square 
of cardboard pinned to the door 
of my office. It was lettered in 
red pencil and in past tense said, 
“The Wistick dufelled the 
Moraddy.” 

HP HE UPRISINGS arose spon- 
taneously in all parts of the 
country. They were not confined 
to colleges. They were not con- 
fined to any particular group. 
They encompassed nearly the 
entire population and the fervor 
aroused by their battle-cry, 
whichever one it might be, was 
beyond all comprehension. 

I could not understand either 
slogan’s meaning — and there 
were others like myself. On sev- 
eral occasions, I attempted to find 
out, but I was beaten twice and 
threatened with a pistol the third 
time, so I gave up all such efforts. 
I was never much given to any 
sort of physical violence. 

One night, I went home thor- 
oughly disheartened by the state 
of affairs. The university was 
hardly functioning. Nearly the 
entire faculty, including the col- 
lege president, had been drawn 
into one camp or the other. Their 
actions were utterly abhorrent to 
me. If the professor was a green- 



THE SEMANTIC WAR 



53 



top, or Wistickian, he lectured 
only to green-tops. If he belonged 
to the Moraddians, or white-top 
faction, they were the only ones 
who could enter his classroom. 

The two groups were so evenly 
divided that open violence was 
frowned upon as a means of at- 
taining whatever end they had 
in view. They were biding their 
time and gathering strength for 
fresh onslaughts on each other. 

As I say, I went home feeling 
very discouraged. My wife was 
in the kitchen preparing dinner, 
and I went in and sat down at 
the table while she worked. The 
daily paper was lying on the 
table, its headlines loaded with 
stories of bloodshed and strife 
throughout the nation. I glanced 
through them. Lately, there 
seemed to be a sort of pattern 
forming. 

East of the Mississippi, the 
general slogan was emerging as 
the Moraddy dufelling the Wis- 
tick. West of the Mississippi, the 
Wistick was receiving the greater 
support. And it seemed that the 
younger people and the women 
preferred the Moraddy, while 
elderly people and most men 
were on the side of the Wistick. 

I commented on this. 

My wife answered briefly, “Of 
course. Anyone should know that 
the Moraddy will win out.” She 
went on with the preparations 
for dinner, not looking at me. 



I sat stunned for a moment. 
Great God in Heaven, not my 
wife! 

“Am I to understand that you 
are taking any part of this seri- 
ously?” I asked with some heat. 
“The whole thing is a horrible, 
pointless prank!” 

She turned and faced me 
squarely. “Not to me. I say the 
Moraddy will win out. I want it 
to — and I think you’d be wise 
to get on the bandwagon while 
there’s still time.” 

I realized she was serious. Dead 
serious. I tried a cautious query: 
“Just what does the dufellation 
of the Wistick by the Moraddy 
mean?” 

A ND IT made her angry. It 
actually made her angry! 
She switched off the front burner 
and walked past me into the liv- 
ing room. I didn’t think she was 
going to answer, but she did — 
sort of. 

“There is no excuse for an egg- 
head in your position not know- 
ing what it means.” Her voice 
was strained and tense. “If you 
had any perception whatever, you 
would understand what the 
Moraddy has to give the Ameri- 
can people. It’s our only hope. 
And you’ve got to take sides. 
You’re either for the Moraddy 
or the Wistick — you can’t take 
the middle way.” 

I felt completely isolated. 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Wait! I don’t know what it 
means — ” 

“Forget it,” she broke in. “I 
should have known. You were 
born, you have lived, and you 
will die an egghead in an ivory 
tower. Just remember — the 
Moraddy dufels the Wistick!” 
And she swept on upstairs to 
pack. And out of my life. 

And that’s the way it was. 
Whatever malignant poison had 
seeped into the collective brain 
of the nation, it was certainly a 
devastating leveler of all sorts of 
institutions and values. Wives 
left husbands and husbands left 
wives. Joint bank accounts van- 
ished. Families disintegrated. 
Wall street crumpled. 

Developments were swift and 
ominous. The Army split up into 
various groups. Most of the en- 
listed men favored the Moraddy, 
but the officers and older non- 
coms pledged the Wistickian 
faith. Their power was sufficient 
to hold many in line, but a con- 
siderable number in the lower 
ranks deserted and joined forces 
with the Moraddians, who held 
the eastern half of the country. 

The Wisticks ruled the western 
half with an iron hand, and all 
signs pointed toward civil war. 
Labor and military authorities 
conscripted the entire population 
regardless of age, sex or religious 
convictions. 

For my own part, I slipped 



away from the campus and fled 
north into the Oregon mountains. 
It was not that I was afraid to 
fight, but I rebelled at the abso- 
lute stupidity of the whole thing. 
The idea — fighting because of 
a few words! 

But they did. 

The destruction was frightful. 
However, it was not as bad as 
many had thought it would be. 
The forces of the Wistick leveled 
the city of New York, true, but 
it took three H-bombs to do the 
job, instead of one, as the Air 
Force had claimed. In retaliation, 
San Francisco and Los Angeles 
were destroyed in a single night 
by cleverly placed atom bombs 
smuggled in by a number of fifth- 
columnist wives who gained 
access to the cities under the 
pretext of returning to their hus- 
bands. This was a great victory 
for the Moraddians, even though 
the women had to blow them- 
selves up to accomplish their 
mission. 

The Moraddian forces were 
slowly beaten back toward the 
Atlantic shores. They were very 
cunning fighters and they had 
youthful courage to implement 
that cunning. But their overall 
policy lacked the stability and 
long-range thinking necessary to 
the prosecution of total war. One 
day they might overrun many 
populous areas and the next day, 
due to the constant bickering and

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



By WILLY LEY 



I T WAS DURING the year 
1609 that Galileo Galilei 
of Pisa, then Professor of 
Mathematics at Padua, learned 
about the invention of a Dutch- 
man involving optical lenses, 
which enabled its user to see 
distant things as if they were 
nearby. A small amount of ex- 
perimentation sufficed to repro- 
duce the instrument which had 
not yet been named “telescope” 
— Galilei himself referred to it 
as the occhiale when writing 
Italian and the perspicillum when 

57 




writing Latin. 

Within a few months, he had 
made quite a number of revolu- 
tionary astronomical discoveries. 
He saw mountains on the Moon. 
He observed that Venus shows 
phases, just as the Moon does. 
He “resolved” the Milky Way 
into countless stars. He saw dark 
spots on the Sun. He discovered 
the four largest moons of Jupiter. 
He noticed that there was some- 
thing strange about the shape of 
Saturn. And he wrote it all down 
in his Sidereal Messenger, which 
appeared in 1610. 

Everything Galilei saw with 
his new instrument can be seen 
with a reasonably good pair of 
binoculars or with a pocket tele- 
scope. In fact, my own 10-power 
pocket telescope — actually a 
target ’scope from a tank gun 
— is superior in many respects 
to Galilei’s occhiale, even dis- 

58 



counting its much smaller size. 
The interesting point is that so 
many of the astronomical facts 
discovered by Galilei are almost, 
but only almost, visible with the 
naked eye. 

I don’t know whether it is true 
that a very few people are able 
to see the four large satellites of 
Jupiter without any optical aid, 
as Jules Verne stated in one of 
his stories. But it is true that 
some of the major lunar features 
can be recognized after you have 
studied a good large photograph 
of the Moon. You could never 
draw them from naked eye ob- 
servation, but once you have 
“learned” them, you can look for 
them with some success. Like- 
wise the phases of Venus are 
very close to naked-eye visibility, 
but only close. To really see them 
needs a few magnifications.

in 1718.

The first drawings of Mars by Fontana. 




TY7ELL, AS soon as there was 
a telescope, however primi- 
tive it may appear in retrospect, 
it was possible to see and to draw 
those things, and the planets sat 
for their first portraits, beginning 
with the Moon. Figure 1 shows 
a drawing of the Moon by Galilei 
himself. It may not be the very 
first telescopic drawing of the 
Moon made — Galilei probably 
made several and published only 
the best — but it certainly is 
one of the earliest. 

The round object visible di- 
rectly on the terminator is in- 
dubitably the Mare serenitatis, 
while the white spot with the 
two white lines going to (or 
from) it is certainly the crater 
we now call Tycho. The roughly 
triangular shadow on the bright 



half near Tycho is probably 
meant to be the Mare humorum 
and the irregularities below the 
Mare serenitatis may be the 
Mare frigoris, dimly seen. 

Compared to Galilei’s sketch, 
the lunar map drawn by the 
Scotsman John Keill just a cen- 
tury later looks virtually modern 
(Fig. 2). It was printed in Ox- 
ford in 1718 in a book entitled 
Introductio ad veram Astro- 
nomiam; all the Mare plains are 
recognizably drawn and many of 
the more conspicuous craters are 
entered, even with indications of 
their systems of “rays.” 

Moving on to the planets, Fig.

tana in 1636 and 1638. Since

side the orbit of Earth, it can 
never show phases like Venus. 
Only a small portion of the night 
side of Mars could be seen from 
Earth when the relative positions 
are favorable. Since there is noth- 
ing luminous on the portion of 
the Martian globe that happens 
to have night, it simply disap- 
pears from view. Fontana, in one 
of his drawings, caught this maxi- 
mum phase that Mars can show. 

But the dark portion in the 
center and the dark rim near the 
edge of the disk does not cor- 
respond to anything known, indi- 
cating that Fontana’s telescope 
must have been rather imperfect. 
The two drawings of Mars made 
by Christian Huyghens only a 
few decades later are much bet-

ter. The darkish triangular area 
is probably meant to be the one 
now called Syrtis major and one 
of the two drawings shows a 
rather clear indication of the 
south polar cap of Mars (Fig. 4). 

But Mars is a difficult object 
even now, just because most of 
its markings are so faint. More- 
over, Mars can be seen well only 
when it comes close to Earth, 
roughly every two years and two 
months. Giant Jupiter is a far 
better object. 

It is bigger, to begin with, and 
it is so far distant from the Earth 
at any time that it does not make 
too much difference whether both 
planets are in neighboring sectors 
of their orbits as seen from the 
Sun. Even the earliest drawings

CASSINI, 1691. 



Three typical drawings of Jupiter made by 
various observers of the 17th century. 



of Jupiter by Bartoli, Grimaldi, 
Cassini and Hooke (Fig. 5 and 
6) can be recognized at a glance 
for what they are supposed to be. 

J EAN DOMINIQUE Cassini’s 
drawing is not only one of the 
early drawings of Jupiter; it is 
also the first to show the feature 
which later became famous as 
the Red Spot. That Red Spot — 
it isn’t always red incidently; it 
has been seen as orange, yellow, 



lavender and plain gray — was 
greeted as a great novelty when 
it became faintly visible in 1872. 
Eight years later, in 1880, it was 
most pronounced and of a par- 
ticularly vivid color. 

Speculation ran high then. 
Some astronomers thought they 
were lucky enough to actually 
observe the birth of still another 
moon of Jupiter. Remember that 
in 1880 it was still generally be- 
lieved that the satellites of the 
planets had been produced by 
their primaries by flinging por- 
tions of their own masses into 
space. Maybe here was a lucky 
chance to observe this very pro- 
cess.

Other astronomers believed, 
however, that they were seeing 
just the opposite — not the birth 
of a new moon, but the funeral 
of an old moon or at least a 
potential moon. They thought 
that one of the asteroids, pulled 
out of its belt by Jupiter’s gravi- 
tational might, had crashed and 
that the Red Spot was the reflec- 
tion of enormous lava flows 
caused by the impact. 

In the middle of the spirited 
debate, somebody discovered an 
older drawing of Jupiter which 
showed the Spot, although it was 
very faint and not labeled “red.” 
And then, knowing what to look 
for, it was traced farther back, 
the trail ending with Cassini’s 
picture. In short, the Spot has 
been there for centuries, being 
sometimes well defined and some- 
times not — and we still don’t 
know what it is. 

A strange case, to my mind, is 
presented by Fig. 7. The drawing 
was made by Johannes Hevelius 
(real name : Hewelcke) of Dan- 
zig who built himself an observa- 
tory in 1641 and who is usually 
mentioned with much praise for 
his observations of the Moon and 
his improved star catalogue. The 
lunar maps of Hevelius consti- 
tuted progress, but his drawing 
of Jupiter is practically meaning- 
less. If it did not have the name 
of the planet engraved on it, one 
might think it an early attempt at 




drawing the faint markings of 
the daylight side of Mercury or 
perhaps the disk of Venus. 

By the time Hevelius built his 
observatory, it was known to

Galileo Galilei's observations of Jupiter in 
January 1610, proving the existence of the 
four large moons.

everybody interested in astron- 
omy that Jupiter had four large 
moons. They are so easily visible 
with any telescope of any kind 
that Galilei must have seen them 
the very first time he pointed his 
occhiale at Jupiter. But at first 
he may have thought that he 
just saw a few stars which hap- 
pened to lie in the direction of 
Jupiter. 

To be sure they were satellites, 
one had to establish that they 
move around the planet and in 
January, 1610, Galilei watched 
for this particular phenomenon. 
The drawings reproduced as Fig. 
8 were the result. Of course Gali- 
lei just marked their positions, 
but even so, they are the first 
drawing of satellites of another 
planet. 

VW^HEN IT came to Saturn, 
™ something new entered the 
picture. Every schoolboy — and 
quite a number of the fathers of 
schoolboys — knows nowadays 
that Saturn has rings. And know- 
ing that Saturn has rings and 
having seen drawings of the rings 
of Saturn, everybody can “see” 
them at once when given access 
to a telescope. But the early tele- 
scopes were small and weak. In 
addition, nobody had ever even 
guessed that a planet may have 
rings. 

There was nothing else in na- 
ture which compared with what

the telescope showed, wavering 
because of the constant move- 
ment of the atmosphere and with 
beautiful-looking but annoying 
rainbow fringes. To add to these 
difficulties, the planet itself ap- 
peared much smaller than Jupi- 
ter. We now know that it actually 
is somewhat smaller than Jupiter, 
but the main reason for the ap- 
parent smallness was simply its 
greater distance, for the orbit of 



Saturn is 400 million miles be- 
yond Jupiter’s. 

Galilei’s impression of this dif- 
ficult planet was that it might 
be a triple planet (see Fig. 9, top 
drawing) while, to Christopher 
Scheiner, it looked as if the two 
smaller spheres were attached to 
the main body. To Pierre Gas- 
sendi, it appeared rather as hav- 
ing the general shape of a football 
with two large dark holes in it. 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Johannes Hevelius saw and drew 
the appearance fairly correctly, 
but was at a loss to explain what 
he saw. 

The drawing made by Gio- 
vanni Battista Riccioli (Fig. 9, 
bottom drawing) also looks quite 
correct to us, though it seems 
that Riccioli believed that the 
two “handles” were somehow at- 
tached to the planet’s body. 

It is somewhat strange that 
none of these early astronomers 
who strained their eyes to under- 
stand the mysterious shape of 
Saturn noticed Saturn’s satellite, 
Titan. Though pretty far away, 
it is, after all, not only Saturn’s 
largest satellite, but by far the 
largest one in the whole Solar 
System, surpassing Mercury, the 
smallest of the planets, by more 
than 500 miles in diameter. Mer- 
cury’s diameter is almost exactly 
3000 miles, while that of Titan 
is around 3550 miles. 



The man who finally did dis- 
cover Titan also solved the prob- 
lem of the “appendages” of Sat- 
urn. He was the Dutchman 
Christian Huyghens, who lived at 
The Hague and who built himself 
a telescope which could magnify 
up to 100 times. It was not a 
large telescope, for it had an 
aperture of only 2-1/3 inches, 
with a focal length of 23 feet. 

TTUYGHENS discovered Titan 
in 1655 and, during the fol- 
lowing year, he realized that the 
appendages were actually a flat 
ring around the planet, not touch- 
ing it at any point (Fig. 10, top). 
Knowing that it was a flat and 
unattached ring did not reveal 
anything about its nature, of 
course, but just then the time 
approached that was favorable 
for discovering a little more de- 
tail. 

The ring always maintains the 




Cassini's drawing marking the 
discovery of Saturn's moon Rhea on December 23rd 1672.

same “attitude” in space, and as 
Saturn and Earth are moving 
around the Sun, we see the ring 
more or less “open” depending 
on the mutual positions. It can 
and does happen that we see the 
ring edge on. Since it is quite 
thin, it simply disappears from 
view in that position, except for 
observers with very powerful 
telescopes. 

The other possible extreme is 
that we can see even the farther 
rim of the ring raised a bit above 
the rim of the sphere of the 
planet itself — Riccioli caught 
this position in his drawing. When 
Huyghens made his discovery, 
the ring presented itself in an 
intermediate aspect, but in the 
following years it “opened up” 
some more. 

The first observers to notice a 
detail on the ring were the broth- 
ers Ball in Minehead, England, 
who reported that they had seen, 
in the late evening of October 
13, 1665, that the ring showed 
a black line. But apparently no 
conclusions were drawn and the 
statement itself was more or less 
forgotten. 

In 1668, Jean Dominique Cas- 
sini, following an invitation by 
Louis XIV of France, gave up 
his professorship at Bologna and 
moved to Paris. And just ten 
years after the announcement of 
the black line by the brothers 
Ball, Cassini saw it very clearly 

66 



himself and continued to watch 
for it to see whether it was a 
permanent marking. In 1676, he 
made a drawing which he pub- 
lished (Fig. 10, bottom) and the 
main gap has been referred to 
as “Cassini’s Division” ever since, 
and the “ring” became “rings.” 

Because Cassini watched Sat- 
urn so carefully for the sake of 
the black line on or in the ring, 
it was very nearly inevitable that 
he should also discover some of 
the other moons of Saturn. Both 
Japetus and Rhea are large, with 
a diameter of around 1000 miles 
each, and Cassini discovered both 
of them: Japetus in 1671 and 
Rhea in 1672 (Fig. 11). In 1684, 
he found two more: Tethys and 
Dione. 

We’ve come a long way since 
those first portraits of major dis- 
coveries in the Solar System — 
but we couldn’t have done it 
without them and similar patient 
observations. Unlike old family 
pictures, they aren’t a bit laugh- 
able. 

The real miracle is that so 
much was learned with so little 
in the way of equipment. 

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Would you please tell me what 
the Doppler effect is? 

Mike Davenport 
8014 Broadleat Avenue 
Van Nuys, Calif. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The Doppler effect is named 
after Christian Johann Doppler, 
an Austrian physicist who died 
in 1853. He did not “discover” 
it in the customary sense of the 
word; he reasoned that it had 
to exist. Experimental proof 
was later established by others. 

To understand the principle, 
imagine that you have a gadget 
which sends out 1000 separate 
impulses per second, such as 
1000 very short bursts of radio 
waves. If you move rapidly 
away from this gadget, you will 
receive less than 1000 impulses 
per second. If you approach it 
rapidly, you’ll receive more 
than 1000 impulses per second. 

A sound is actually a succes- 
sion of such impulses, the 
sound waves. If you approach 
the source of the sound rapidly, 
you’ll “receive” more of them 
per second, which sounds like 
a higher note. Moving away 
from the sound source pro- 
duces a lower note. 

Experimentally, this can be 
shown quite easily by driving 
past an electric hell. At the 
instant you pass it, it ‘seems to 
acquire a lower pitch. The 
whistle of a train passing the 
observer seems to undergo the 
same change. 

Doppler predicted this effect 
in 1842 and it was proved ex- 
perimentally for sound waves 
for the first time by Buys-Ballot

in 1845. Proof that light waves 
produce the Doppler effect was 
first given by Fizeau in 1848. 

The Doppler effect is very 
useful for establishing the velo- 
cities of bodies receding from 
or approaching the observer 
along the line of sight. 

Recently I was told by a friend 
that there may be some giant 
sloths still living. What is the 
case for this? 

Frank E. Goodwyn 
9709 Lorain Avenue 
Silver Springs, Md. 

The somewhat paradoxical 
answer is that there is no case 
for living giant sloths right 
now, hut that some zoologists 
once thought they had one. 

It was during the early dec- 
ades of the 19th century that 
the giant sloth became known 
— as a fossil, naturally. The 
great problem then was just 
when it had lived and, more 
specifically, whether primitive 
Man in America and the giant 
sloth had ever met. When evi- 
dence for contemporary exist- 
ence of giant sloth and Man in 
South America was found, an- 
other discovery came to light. 

Almost at the southern end 
of the South American contin- 
ent, there is an inlet which was 
named Ultima Esperanza, and 
a retired German sea captain 

67 



by the name of Eberliard built 
himself a ranch there. Some- 
where on that ranch was the 
skin of a large animal and 
when a piece of the skin came 
into the hands of a professional 
zoologist, it turned out to be 
the skin of a giant sloth. 

It was then that Professor 
Florentino Ameghino of Argen- 
tina announced that the giant 
sloth probably was not extinct, 
but had merely grown very 
rare. He quoted the experience 
of one Ramon Lista who told 
of having been startled by a 
large unknown animal one 
night while camping in the in- 
terior. 

Since the genus of giant 
sloth Ameghino expected to be 
surviving was Mylodon, he 
coined the name of Neomylo- 
don listai for the living species. 

A search of early descrip- 
tions of South American ani- 
mals also yielded several suspi- 
cious passages. Ameghino said 
that the native languages con- 
tained a name for an animal 
which could only be Neomylo- 
don. The result of all this was 
that a British newspaper or- 
ganized an expedition. 

The expedition return empty- 
handed and some later news- 
paper accounts may not be 
entirely truthful. 

With modern methods like 
radio-carbon dating, it would 



be possible to establish the true 
age of that skin, but I don’t 
believe that this has been done. 
However, various remains of 
giant sloth from Texas have 
been so dated; the figures ran 
to ages of from 8,000 to 12,000 
years. This confirms the other 
evidence that early American 
Man and giant sloth met. 

That the interior of South 
America may still harbor sur- 
vivors cannot be categorically 
denied. But there is no proof, 
either.

T ENSION hung over the 
three waiting men. They 
smoked, paced back and 
forth, kicked aimlessly at weeds 
growing by the side of the road. 
A hot noonday sun glared down 
on brown fields, rows of neat 
plastic houses, the distant line of 
mountains to the west. 

“Almost time,” Earl Perine 
said, knotting his skinny hands 
together. “It varies according to 
the load, a half-second for every 
additional pound.” 

Bitterly, Morrison answered. 
“You’ve got it plotted? You’re as 
bad as it is. Let’s pretend it just 
happens to be late.” 

The third man said nothing. 
O’Neill was visiting from another 
settlement; he didn’t know Perine 
and Morrison well enough to ar- 
gue with them. Instead, he 
crouched down and arranged the 
papers clipped to his aluminum 
check-board. In the blazing sun, 
O’Neill’s arms were tanned, fur- 
ry, glistening with sweat. Wiry, 
with tangled gray hair, horn-rim- 
med glasses, he was older than 
the other two. He wore slacks, a 
sports shirt and crepe-soled 
shoes. Between his fingers, his 
fountain pen glittered, metallic 
and efficient. 

W HAT’RE you writing?” 
Perine grumbled. 

“I’m laying out the procedure 
we’re going to employ,” O’Neill

said mildly. “Better to systemize 
it now, instead of trying at ran- 
dom. We want to know what we 
tried and what didn’t work. 
Otherwise we’ll go around in a 
circle. The problem we have here 
is one of communication; that’s 
how I see it.” 

“Communication,” Morrison 
agreed in his deep, chesty voice. 
“Yes, we can’t get in touch with 
the damn thing. It comes, leaves 
off its load and goes on — there’s 
no contact between us and it.” 

“It’s a machine,” Perine said 
excitedly. “It’s dead — blind and 
deaf.” 

“But it’s in contact with the 
outside world,” O’Neill pointed 
out. “There has to be some way 
to get to it. Specific semantic sig- 
nals are meaningful to it; all we 
have to do is find those signals. 
Rediscover, actually. Maybe half 
a dozen out of a billion possibi- 
lities.” 

A low rumble interrupted the 
three men. They glanced up, 
wary and alert. The time had 
come. 

“Here it is,” Perine said. 
“Okay, wise guy, let’s see you 
make one single change in its 
routine.” 

The truck was massive, rumb- 
ling under its tightly packed 
load. In many ways, it resembled 
conventional human-operated 
transportation vehicles, but with 
one exception — there was no 



driver’s cabin. The horizontal 
surface was a loading stage, and 
the part that would normally be 
the headlights and radiator grill 
was a fibrous spongelike mass of 
receptors, the limited sensory ap- 
paratus of this mobile utility ex- 
tension. 

Aware of the three men, the 
truck slowed to a halt, shifted 
gears and pulled on its emergency 
brake. A moment passed as re- 
lays moved into action; then a 
-portion of the loading surface 
tilted and a cascade of heavy 
cartons spilled down onto the 
brown dust of the roadway. With 
the objects fluttered a detailed 
inventory sheet. 

“You know what to do,” 
O’Neill said rapidly. “Hurry up, 
before it gets out of here.” 

Expertly, grimly, the three men 
grabbed up the deposited cartons 
and ripped the protective wrap- 
pers from them. Objects gleamed: 
a binocular microscope, a port- 
able radio, heaps of plastic dish- 
es, medical supplies, razor blades, 
clothing, food. Most of the ship- 
ment, as usual, was food. The 
three men systematically began 
smashing the objects. In a few 
minutes, there was nothing but a 
chaos of debris littered around 
them. 

“That’s that,” O’Neill panted, 
stepping back. He fumbled for 
his check-sheet. “Now let’s see 
what it does.” 



72 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



JTVHE truck had begun to move 
away; abruptly it stopped and 
backed toward them. Its recep- 
tors had taken in the fact that the 
three men had demolished the 
dropped-off portion of the load. 
It spun in a grinding half-circle 
and came around to face its re- 
ceptor bank in their direction. Up 
went its antenna; it had begun 
communicating with the factory. 
Instructions were on the way. 

A second, identical load was 
tilted and shoved off the truck. 

“We failed,” Perine groaned as 
a duplicate inventory sheet flut- 
tered after the new load. “We 
destroyed all that stuff for noth- 
ing.” 

“What now?” Morrison asked 
O’Neill. “What’s the next strate- 
gem on your board?” 

“Give me a hand.” O’Neill 
grabbed up a carton and lugged 
it back to the truck. Sliding the 
carton onto the platform, he turn- 
ed for another. The other two 
men followed clumsily after him. 
They put the load back onto the 
truck. As the truck started for- 
ward, the last square box was 
again in place. 

The truck hesitated. Its recep- 
tors registered the return of its 
load. From within its works came 
a low sustained buzzing. 

“This may drive it crazy,” 
O’Neill commented, sweating. “It 
went through its operation and 
accomplished nothing.” 



The truck made a short, abor- 
tive move toward going on. Then 
it swung purposefully around 
and, in a blur of speed, again 
dumped the load onto the road. 

“Get them!” O’Neill yelled. 
The three men grabbed up the 
cartons and feverishly reloaded 
them. But as fast as the cartons 
were shoved back on the horizon- 
tal stage, the truck’s grapples 
tilted them down its far-side 
ramps and onto the road. 

“No use,” Morrison said, 
breathing hard. “Water through 
a sieve.” 

“We’re licked,” Perine gasped 
in wretched agreement, “like al- 
ways. We humans lose every 
time.” 

The truck regarded them calm- 
ly, its receptors blank and im- 
passive. It was doing its job. The 
planetwide network of automatic 
factories was smoothly perform- 
ing the task imposed on it five 
years before, in the early days of 
the Total Global Conflict. 

“There it goes,” Morrison ob- 
served dismally. The truck’s an- 
tenna had come down; it shifted 
into low gear and released its 
parking brake. 

“One last try,” O’Neill said. 
He swept up one of the cartons 
and ripped it open. From it he 
dragged a ten-gallon milk tank 
and unscrewed the lid. “Silly as 
it seems.” 

“This is absurd,” Perine pro- 



A U TO F A C

tested. Reluctantly, he found a 
cup among the littered debris and 
dipped it into the milk. “A kid’s 
game!” 

The truck had paused to ob- 
serve them. 

“Do it,” O’Neill ordered sharp- 
ly. “Exactly the way we prac- 
ticed it.” 

The three of them drank 
quickly from the milk tank, vis- 
ibly allowing the milk to spill 
down their chins; there had to be 
no mistaking what they were 
doing. 

As planned, O’Neill was the 
first. His face twisting in revul- 
sion, he hurled the cup away and 
violently spat milk into the road. 

“God’s sake!” he choked. 

The other two did the same; 
stamping and loudly cursing, 
they kicked over the milk tank 
and glared accusingly at the 
truck. 

“It’s no good !” Morrison 
roared. 

C URIOUS, the truck came 
slowly back. Electronic syn- 
apses clicked and whirred, re- 
sponding to the situation; its an- 
tenna shot up like a flagpole. 

“I think this is it,” O’Neill said, 
trembling. As the truck watched, 
he dragged out a second milk 
tank, unscrewed its lid and tasted 
the contents. “The same!” he 
shouted at the truck. “It’s just 
as bad!” 



From the truck popped a 
metal cylinder. The cylinder 
dropped at Morrison’s feet; he 
quickly snatched it up and tore 
it open. 

STATE NATURE OF DEFECT 

The instruction sheets listed 
rows of possible defects, with neat 
boxes by each; a punch-stick was 
included to indicate the particu- 
lar deficiency of the product. 

“What’ll I check?” Morrison 
asked. “Contaminated? Bacte- 
rial? Sour? Rancid? Incorrectly 
labeled? Broken? Crushed ? 
Cracked? Bent? Soiled?” 

Thinking rapidly, O’Neill said, 
“Don’t check any of them. The 
factory’s undoubtedly ready to 
test and resample. It’ll' make its 
own analysis and then ignore us.” 
His face glowed as frantic inspir- 
ation came. “Write in that blank 
at the bottom. It’s an open space 
for further data.” 

“Write what?” 

O’Neill said, “Write: the prod- 
uct is thoroughly pizzled.” 

“What’s that?” Perine de- 
manded, baffled. 

“Write it! . It’s a semantic 
garble — the factory won’t be able 
to understand it. Maybe we can 
jam the works.” 

With O’Neill’s pen, Morrison 
carefully wrote that the milk was 
pizzled. Shaking his head, he re- 
sealed the cylinder and returned 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



it to the truck. The truck swept 
up the milk tanks and slammed 
its railing tidily into place. With 
a shriek of tires, it hurtled off. 
From its slot, a final cylinder 
bounced; the truck hurriedly de- 
parted, leaving the cylinder lying 
in the dust. 

O’Neill got it open and held 
up the paper for the others to see. 

A FACTORY REPRESEN- 
TATIVE WILL BE SENT 
OUT. 

BE PREPARED TO SUP- 
PLY COMPLETE DATA 
ON PRODUCT DEFI- 
CIENCY. 

For a moment, the three men 
were silent. Then Perine began to 
giggle. “We did it. We contacted 
it. We got across.” 

“We sure did,” O’Neill agreed. 
“It never heard of a product 
being pizzled.” 

Cut into the base of the moun- 
tains lay the vast metallic cube 
of the Kansas City factory. Its 
surface was corroded, pitted with 
radiation pox, cracked and scar- 
red from the five years of war 
that had swept over it. Most of 
the factory was buried subsurface, 
only its entrance stages visible. 
The truck was a speck rumbling 
at high speed toward the expanse 
of black metal. Presently an 
opening formed in the uniform 
surface; the truck plunged into 
it and disappeared inside. The 
entrance snapped shut. 



“Now the big job remains,” 
O’Neill said. “Now we have to 
persuade it to close down opera- 
tions — to shut itself off.” 

J UDITH O’NEILL served hot 
black coffee to the people sit- 
ting around the living room. Her 
husband talked while the others 
listened. O’Neill was as close to 
being an authority on the auto- 
fac system as could still be found. 

In his own area, the Chicago 
region, he had shorted out the 
protective fence of the local fac- 
tory long enough to get away 
with the data tapes stored in its 
posterior brain. The factory, of 
course, had immediately recon- 
structed a better type of fence. 
But he had shown that the fac- 
tories were not infallible. 

“The Institute of Applied Cyb- 
ernetics,” O’Neill explained, “had 
complete control over the net- 
work. Blame the war. Blame the 
big noise along the lines of com- 
munication that wiped out the 
knowledge we need. In any case, 
the Institute failed to transmit 
its information to us, so we can’t 
transmit our information to the 
factories — the news that the war 
is over and we’re ready to resume 
control of industrial operations.” 
“And meanwhile,” Morrison 
added sourly, “the damn network 
expands and consumes more of 
our natural resources all the 
time.”

“I get the feeling,” Judith said, 
“that if I stamped hard enough, 
I’d fall right down into a factory 
tunnel. They must have mines 
everywhere by now.” 

“Isn’t there some limiting in- 
junction?” Perine asked nervous- 
ly. “Were they set up to expand 
indefinitely?” 

“Each factory is limited to its 
own operational area,” O’Neill 
said, “but the network itself is 
unbounded. It can go on scooping 
up our resources forever. The In- 
stitute decided it gets top priori- 
ty ; we mere people come second.” 
“Will there be anything left 
for us?” Morrison wanted to 
know. 

“Not unless we can stop the 
network’s operations. It’s already 
used up half a dozen basic min- 
erals. Its search teams are out 
all the time, from every factory, 
looking everywhere for some last 
scrap to drag home.” 

“What would happen if tunnels 
from two factories crossed each 
other?” 

O’Neill shrugged. “Normally, 
that won’t happen. Each factory 
has its own special section of our 
planet, its own private cut of the 
pie for its exclusive use.” 

“But it could happen.” 

“Well, they’re raw-material- 
tropic ; as long as there’s anything 
left, they’ll hunt it down.” 
O’Neill pondered the idea with 
growing interest. “It’s something 



to consider. I suppose as things 
get scarcer — ” 

He stopped talking. A figure 
had come into the room; it stood 
silently by the door, surveying 
them all. 

TN the dull shadows, the figure 

looked almost human. For a 
brief moment, O’Neill thought it 
was a settlement latecomer. 
Then, as it moved forward, he 
realized that it was only quasi- 
human: a functional upright 

biped chassis, with data-recep- 
tors mounted at the top, effectors 
and proprioceptors mounted in a 
downward worm that ended in 
floor-grippers. Its resemblance to 
a human being was testimony to 
nature’s efficiency; no sentimen- 
tal imitation was intended. 

The factory representative had 
arrived. 

It began without preamble. 
“This is a data-collecting ma- 
chine capable of communicating 
on an oral basis. It contains both 
broadcasting and receiving ap- 
paratus and can integrate facts 
relevant to its line of inquiry.” 

The voice was pleasant, confi- 
dent. Obviously it was a tape, re- 
corded by some Institute tech- 
nician before the war. Coming 
from the quasi-human shape, it 
sounded grotesque; O’Neill could 
vividly imagine the dead young 
man whose cheerful voice now 
issued from the mechanical 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mouth of this upright construc- 
tion of steel and wiring. 

“One word of caution,” the 
pleasant voice continued. “It is 
fruitless to consider this receptor 
human and to engage it in dis- 
cussions for which it is not equip- 
ped. Although purposeful, it is 
not capable of conceptual 
thought; it can only reassemble 
material already available to it.” 
The optimistic voice clicked 
out and a second voice came on. 
It resembled the first, but now 
there were no intonations or per- 
sonal mannerisms. The machine 
was utilizing the dead man’s pho- 
netic speech-pattern for its own 
communication. 

“Analysis of the rejected prod- 
uct,” it stated, “shows no foreign 
elements or noticeable deteriora- 
tion. The product meets the 
continual testing-standards em- 
ployed throughout the network. 
Rejection is therefore on a basis 
outside the test area; standards 
not available to the network are 
being employed.” 

“That’s right,” O’Neill agreed. 
Weighing his words with care, he 
continued, “We found the milk 
substandard. We want nothing to 
do with it. We insist on more 
careful output.” 

The machine responded pres- 
ently. “The semantic content of 
the term pizzled is unfamiliar 
to the network. It does not exist 
in the taped vocabulary. Can you 

AUTOFAC 



present a factual analysis of the 
milk in terms of specific elements 
present or absent?” 

“No,” O’Neill said warily; the 
game he was playing was intri- 
cate and dangerous. “Pizzled is 
an over-all term. It can’t be re- 
duced to chemical constituents.” 
“What does pizzled signify?” 
the machine asked. “Can you de- 
fine it in terms of alternate se- 
mantic symbols?” 

O ’NEILL hesitated. The repre- 
sentative had to be steered 
from its special inquiry to more 
general regions, to the ultimate 
problem of closing down the net- 
work. If he could pry it open at 
any point, get the theoretical dis- 
cussion started . 

“Pizzled,” he stated, “means 
the condition of a product that 
is manufactured when no need 
exists. It indicates the rejection 
of objects on the grounds that 
they are no longer wanted.” 

The representative said, “Net- 
work analysis shows a need of 
high-grade pasteurized milk-sub- 
stitute in this area. There is no 
alternate source; the network 
controls all the synthetic mam- 
mary-type equipment in exis- 
tence.” It added, “Original taped 
instructions describe milk as an 
essential to human diet.” 

O’Neill was being outwitted; 
the machine was returning the 
discussion to the specific. “We’ve 

77 



decided,” he said desperately, 
“that we don’t want any more 
milk. We’d prefer to go without 
it, at least until we can locate 
cows.” 

“That is contrary to the net- 
work tapes,” the representative 
objected. “There are no cows. All 
milk is produced synthetically.” 
“Then we’ll produce it synthet-' 
ically ourselves,” Morrison broke 
in impatiently. “Why can’t we 
take over the machines? My 
God, we’re not children! We can 
run our own lives!” 

The factory representative 
moved toward the door. “Until 
such time as your community 
finds other sources of milk-sup- 
ply, the network will continue to 
supply you. Analytical and eval- 
uating apparatus will remain in 
this area, conducting the cus- 
tomary random sampling.” 
Perine shouted futilely, “How 
can we find other sources? You 
have the whole setup! You’re 
running the whole show!” Fol- 
lowing after it, he bellowed, “You 
say we’re not ready to run things 
— you claim we’re not capable. 
How do you know? You don’t 
give us a chance! We’ll never 
have a chance!” 

O’Neill was petrified. The ma- 
chine was leaving; its one-track 
mind had completely triumphed. 

“Look,” he said hoarsely, 
blocking its way. “We want you 
to shut down, understand. We 



want to take over your equip- 
ment and run it ourselves. The 
war’s over with. Damn it, you’re 
not needed any more!” 

HTHE factory representative 
paused briefly at the door. 
“The inoperative cycle,” it said, 
“is not geared to begin until net- 
work production merely dupli- 
cates outside production. There 
is at this time, according to our 
continual sampling, no outside 
production. Therefore network 
production continues.” 

Without warning, Morrison 
swung the steel pipe in his hand. 
It slashed against the machine’s 
shoulder and burst through the 
elaborate network of sensory ap- 
paratus that made up its chest. 
The tank of receptors shattered; 
bits of glass, wiring and minute 
parts showered everywhere. 

“It’s a paradox!” Morrison 
yelled. “A word game — a seman- 
tic game they’re pulling on us. 
The Cyberneticists have it rig- 
ged.” He raised the pipe and 
again brought it down savagely 
on the unprotesting machine. 
“They’ve got us hamstrung. 
We’re completely helpless.” 

The room was in uproar. “It’s 
the only way,” Perine gasped as 
he pushed past O’Neill. “We’ll 
have to destroy them — it’s the 
network or us.” Grabbing down 
a lamp, he hurled it in the “face” 
of the factory representative. The 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



lamp and the- intricate surface of 
plastic burst; Perine waded in, 
groping blindly for the machine. 
Now all the people in the room 
were closing furiously around the 
upright cylinder, their impotent 
resentment boiling over. The ma- 
chine sank down and disappeared 
as they dragged it to the floor. 

Trembling, O’Neill turned 
away. His wife caught hold of 
his arm and led him to the side 
of the room. 

“The idiots,” he said dejected- 
ly. “They can’t destroy it; they’ll 
only teach it to build more de- 
fenses. They’re making the whole 
problem worse.” 

Into the living room rolled a 
network repair team. Expertly, 
the mechanical units detached 
themselves from the half-track 
mother-bug and scurried toward 
the mound of struggling humans. 
They slid between people and 
rapidly burrowed. A moment 
later, the inert carcass of the fac- 
tory representative was dragged 
into the hopper of the mother- 
bug. Parts were collected, torn 
remnants gathered up and car- 
ried off. The last plastic strut and 
gear was located. Then the units 
restationed themselves on the bug 
and the team departed. 

Through the open door came 
a second factory representative, 
an exact duplicate of the first. 
And outside in the hall stood two 
more upright machines. The set- 



tlement had been combed at ran- 
dom by a corps of representa- 
tives. Like a horde of ants, the 
mobile data-collecting machines 
had filtered through the town 
until, by chance, one of them had 
come across O’Neill. 

“Destruction of network mo- 
bile data-gathering equipment is 
detrimental to best human inter- 
ests,” the factory representative 
informed the roomful of people. 
“Raw material intake is at a 
dangerously low ebb; what basic 
materials still exist should be 
utilized in the manufacture of 
consumer commodities.” 

O’Neill and the machine stood 
facing each other. 

“Oh?” O’Neill said softly. 
“That’s interesting. I wonder 
what you’re lowest on — and what 
you’d really be willing to fight 
for.” 

TTELICOPTER rotors whined 
tinnily above O’Neill’s head; 
he ignored them and peered 
through the cabin window at the 
ground not far below. 

Slag and ruins stretched every- 
where. Weeds poked their way 
up, sickly stalks among which in- 
sects scuttled. Here and there, rat 
colonies were visible: matted 

hovels constructed of bone and 
rubble. Radiation had mutated 
the rats, along with most insects 
and animals. A little farther, 
O’Neill identified a squadron of 



AUTOFAC 



79 



t 

birds pursuing a ground squirrel. 
The squirrel dived into a care- 
fully prepared crack in the sur- 
face of slag and the birds turned, 
thwarted. 

“You think we’ll ever have it 
rebuilt?” Morrison asked. “It 
makes me sick to look at it.” 

“In time,” O’Neill answered. 
“Assuming, of course, that we get 
industrial control back. And as- 
suming that anything remains to 
work with. At best, it’ll be slow. 
We’ll have to inch out from the 
settlements.” 

To the right was a human col- 
ony, tattered scarecrows, gaunt 
and emaciated, living among the 
ruins of what had once been a 
town. A few acres of barren soil 
had been cleared; drooping vege- 
tables wilted in the sun, chickens 
wandered listlessly here and 
there, and a fly-bothered horse 
lay panting in the shade of a 
crude shed. 

“Ruins-squatters,” O’Neill said 
gloomily. “Too far from the net- 
work — not tangent to any of the 
factories.” 

“It’s their own fault,” Morri- 
son told him angrily. “They 
could come into one of the settle- 
ments.” 

“That was their town. They’re 
trying to do what we’re trying to 
do — build up things again on 
their own. But they’re starting 
now, without tools or machines, 
with their bare hands, nailing to- 



G A

gether bits of rubble. And it won’t 
work. We need machines. We 
can’t repair ruins; we’ve got to 
start industrial production.” 

Ahead lay a series of broken 
hills, chipped remains that had 
once been a ridge. Beyond 
stretched out the titanic ugly sore 
of an H-bomb crater, half-filled 
with stagnant water and slime, a 
disease-ridden inland sea. 

And beyond that — a glitter of 
busy motion. 

“There,” O’Neill said tensely. 
He lowered the helicopter rapid- 
ly. “Can you tell which factory 
they’re from?” 

“They all look alike to me,” 
Morrison muttered, leaning over 
to see. “We’ll have to wait and 
follow them back, when they get 
a load.” 

"If they get a load,” O’Neill 
corrected. 

r TiHE autofac exploring crew 
* ignored the helicopter buzzing 
overhead and concentrated on its 
job. Ahead of the main truck 
scuttled two tractors; they made 
their way up mounds of rubble, 
probes burgeoning like quills, 
shot down the far slope and dis- 
appeared into a blanket of ash 
that lay spread over the slag. 
The two scouts burrowed until 
only their antennae were visible. 
They burst up to the surface and 
scuttled on, their treads whirring 
and clanking. 



AUTOFAC

“What are they after?” Mor- 
rison asked. 

“God knows.” O’Neill leafed 
intently through the papers on 
his clip-board. “We’ll have to 
analyze all our back-order slips.” 

Below them, the autofac ex- 
ploring crew disappeared behind. 
The helicopter passed over a de- 
serted stretch of sand and slag on 
which nothing moved. A grove 
of scrub-brush appeared and 
then, far to the right, a series of 
tiny moving dots. 

A procession of automatic 
ore carts was racing over the 
bleak slag, a string of rapidly 
moving metal trucks that fol- 
lowed one another nose to tail. 
O’Neill turned the helicopter 
toward them and a few minutes 
later it hovered above the mine 
itself. 

Masses of squat mining equip- 
ment had made their way to the 
operations. Shafts had been sunk; 
empty carts waited in patient 
rows. A steady stream of loaded 
carts hurried toward the horizon, 
dribbling ore after them. Activity 
and the noise of machines hung 
over the area, an abrupt center of 
industry in the bleak wastes of 
slag. 

“Here comes that exploring 
crew,” Morrison observed, peer- 
ing back the way they had come. 
“You think maybe they’ll tan- 
gle?” He grinned. “No, I guess 
it’s too much to hope for.” 



“It is this time,” O’Neill an- 
swered. “They’re looking for dif- 
ferent substances, probably. And 
they’re normally conditioned to 
ignore each other.” 

The first of the exploring bugs 
reached the line of ore carts. It 
veered slightly and continued its 
search; the carts traveled in their 
inexorable line as if nothing had 
happened. 

Disappointed, Morrison turned 
away from the window and swore. 
“No use. It’s like each doesn’t 
exist for the other,” 

Gradually the exploring crew 
moved away from the line of 
carts, past the mining operations 
and over a ridge beyond. There 
was no special hurry; they de- 
parted without having reacted 
to the ore-gathering syndrome. 

“Maybe they’re from the same 
factory,” Morrison said hope- 
fully. 

O’Neill pointed to the antennae 
visible on the major mining 
equipment. “Their vanes are turn- 
ed at a different vector, so these 
represent two factories. It’s go- 
ing to be hard; we’ll have to get 
it exactly right or there won’t be 
any reaction.” He clicked on the 
radio and got hold of the moni- 
tor at the settlement. “Any results 
on the consolidated back-order 
sheets?” 

The operator put him through 
to the settlement governing of- 
fices. 



82

“They’re starting to come in,” 
Perine told him. “As soon as we 
get sufficient samplings, we’ll try 
to determine which raw materials 
which factories lack'. It’s going 
to be risky, trying to extrapolate 
from complex products. There 
may be a number of basic ele- 
ments common to the various 
sub-lots.” 

“What happens when we’ve 
identified the missing element?” 
Morrison asked O’Neill. “What 
happens when we’ve got two tan- 
gent factories short on the same 
material?” 

“Then,” O’Neill said grimly, 
“we start collecting the material 
ourselves — even if we have to 
melt down every object in the 
settlements.” • 

III 

TN the moth-ridden darkness 
of night, a dim wind stirred, 
chill and faint. Dense under- 
brush rattled metallically. Here 
and there a nocturnal rodent 
prowled, its senses hyper-alert, 
peering, planning, seeking food. 

The area was wild. No human 
settlements existed for miles; the 
entire region had been seared flat, 
cauterized by repeated H-bomb 
blasts. Somewhere in the murky 
darkness, a sluggish trickle of 
water made its way among slag 
and weeds, dripping thickly in- 
to what had once been an elab- 

AUTOFAC 



orate labyrinth of sewer mains. 
The pipes lay cracked and brok- 
en, jutting up into the night 
darkness, overgrown with creep- 
ing vegetation. The wind raised 
clouds of black ash that swirled 
and danced among the weeds. 
Once, an enormous mutant wren 
stirred sleepily, pulled its crude 
protective night coat of rags 
around it and again dozed off. 

TT'OR a time, there was no 
movement. A streak of stars 
showed in the sky overhead, glow- 
ing starkly, remotely. Earl Perine 
shivered, peered up and hud- 
dled closer to the pulsing heat- 
element placed on the ground 
between the three men. 

“Well?” Morrison challenged, 
teeth chattering. 

O’Neill didn’t answer. He fin- 
ished his cigarette, crushed it 
against a mound of decaying slag 
and, getting out his lighter, lit 
another. The mass of tungsten — 
the bait — lay a hundred yards 
directly ahead of them. 

During the last few days, both 
the Detroit and Pittsburgh fac- 
tories had run short of tungsten. 
And in at least one sector, their 
apparatus overlapped. This slug- 
gish heap represented precision 
cutting tools, parts ripped from 
electrical switches, high-quality 
surgical equipment, sections of 
permanent magnets, measuring 
devices . tungsten from every 

83 



possible source, gathered fever- 
ishly from all the settlements. 

Dark mist lay spread over the 
tungsten mound. Occasionally, 
a night moth fluttered down, at- 
tracted by the glow of reflected 
starlight. The moth hung mo- 
mentarily, beat its elongated 
wings futilely against the inter- 
woven tangle of metal and then 
drifted off, into the shadows of 
the thick-packed vines that rose 
up from the stumps of sewer 
pipes. 

“Not a very damn pretty spot,” 
Perine said wryly. 

“Don’t kid yourself,” O’Neill 
retorted. “This is the prettiest 
spot on Earth. This is the spot 
that marks the grave of the auto- 
fac network. People are going to 
come around here looking for it 
someday. There’s going to be a 
plaque here a mile high.” 

“You’re trying to keep your 
morale up,” Morrison snorted. 
“You don’t believe they’re going 
to slaughter themselves over a 
heap of surgical tools and light- 
bulb filaments. They’ve probably 
got a machine down in the bot- 
tom level that sucks tungsten 
out of rock.” 

“Maybe,” O’Neill said, slap- 
ping at a mosquito. The insect 
dodged cannily and then buzzed 
over to annoy Perine. Perine 
swung viciously at it and squatted 
sullenly down against the damp 
vegetation. 



And there was what they had 
come to see. 

O ’NEILL realized with a start 
that he had been looking at 
it for several minutes without 
recognizing it. The search-bug 
lay absolutely still. It rested at 
the crest of a small rise of slag, 
its anterior end slightly raised, 
receptors fully extended. It might 
have been an abandoned hulk; 
there was no activity of any kind, 
no sign of life or consciousness. 
The search-bug fitted perfectly 
into the wasted, fire-drenched 
landscape. A vague tub of metal 
sheets and gears and flat treads, 
it rested and waited. And 
watched. 

It was examining the heap of 
tungsten. The bait had drawn 
its first bite. 

“Fish,’ ’ Perine said thickly. 
“The line moved. I think the 
sinker dropped.” 

“What the hell are you mum- 
bling about?” Morrison grunted. 
And then he, too, saw the search- 
bug. “Jesus,” he whispered. He 
half-rose to his feet, massive body 
arched forward. “Well, there’s 
one of them. Now all we need is a 
unit from the other factory. Which 
do you suppose it is?” 

O’Neill located the communi- 
cation vane and traced its angle. 
“Pittsburgh, so pray for Detroit 
. pray like mad.” 

Satisfied, the search-bug de- 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tached itself and rolled forward. 
Cautiously approaching the 
mound, it began a series of in- 
tricate maneuvers, rolling first 
one way and then another. The 
three watching men were mysti- 
fied — until they glimpsed the first 
probing stalks of other search- 
bugs. 

“Communication,” O’Neill said 
softly. “Like bees.” 

Now five Pittsburgh search- 
bugs were approaching the 
mound of tungsten products. Re- 
ceptors waving excitedly, they 
increased their pace, scurrying 
in a sudden burst of discovery 
up the side of the mound to the 
top. A bug burrowed and rapid T 
ly disappeared. The whole mound 
shuddered; the bug was down 
inside, exploring the extent of the 
find. 

Ten minutes later, the first 
Pittsburgh ore carts appeared 
and began industriously hurrying 
off with their haul. 

“Damn it!” O’Neill said, ago- 
nized. “They’ll have it all before 
Detroit shows up.” 

“Can’t we do anything to slow 
them down?” Perine demanded 
helplessly. Leaping to his feet, 
he grabbed up a rock and heaved 
it at the nearest cart. The rock 
bounced off and the cart con- 
tinued its work, unperturbed. 

O’Neill got to his feet and 
prowled around, body rigid with 
impotent fury. Where were they? 



The autofacs were equal in all 
respects and the spot was the 
exact same linear distance from 
each center. Theoretically, the 
parties should have arrived si- 
multaneously. Yet there was no 
sign of Detroit — and the final 
pieces of tungsten were being 
loaded before his eyes. 

But then something streaked 
past him. 

H E didn’t recognize it, for the 
object moved too quickly. 
It shot like a bullet among the 
tangled vines, raced up the side of 
the hill-crest, poised for an in- 
stant to aim itself and hurtled 
down the far side. It smashed 
directly into the lead cart. Pro- 
jectile and victim shattered in an 
abrupt burst of sound. 

Morrison leaped up. “What the 
hell?” 

“That’s it!” Perine screamed, 
dancing around and waving his 
skinny arms. “It’s Detroit!” 

A second Detroit search-bug 
appeared, hesitated as it took in 
the situation, and then flung it- 
self furiously at the retreating 
Pittsburgh carts. Fragments of 
tungsten scattered everywhere — 
parts, wiring, broken plates, gears 
and springs and bolts of the two 
antagonists flew in all directions. 
The remaining carts wheeled 
screechingly ; one of them dump- 
ed its load and rattled off at top 
speed. A second followed, still

weighed down with tungsten. A 
Detroit search-bug caught up 
with it, spun directly in its path 
and neatly overturned it. Bug 
and cart rolled down a shallow 
trench, into a stagnant pool of 
water. Dripping and glistening, 
the two of them struggled, half- 
submerged. 

“Well,” O’Neill said unsteadi- 
ly, “we did it. We can start back 
home.” His legs felt weak. 
“Where’s our vehicle?” 

As he gunned the truck motor, 
something flashed a long way off, 
something large and metallic, 
moving over the dead slag and 
ash. It was a dense clot of carts, 
a solid expanse of heavy-duty 
ore carriers racing to the scene. 
Which factory were they from? 

It didn’t matter, for out of the 
thick tangle of black dripping 
vines, a web of counter- extensions 
was creeping to meet them. Both 
factories were assembling their 
mobile units. From all directions, 
bugs slithered and crept, closing 
in around the remaining heap of 
tungsten. Neither factory was go- 
ing to let needed raw material get 
away; neither was going to give 
up its find. Blindly, mechanical- 
ly, in the grip of inflexible direc- 
tives, the two opponents labored 
to assemble superior forces. 

“Come on,” Morrison said urg- 
ently. “Let’s get out of here. All 
hell is bursting loose.” 

O’Neill hastily turned the truck 



in the direction of the settlement. 
They began rumbling through 
the darkness on their way back. 
Every now and then, a metallic 
shape shot by them, going in the 
opposite direction. 

“Did you see the load in that 
last cart?” Perine asked, worried. 
“It wasn’t empty.” 

TVTEITHER were the carts that 
' followed it, a whole proces- 
sion of bulging supply carriers 
directed by an elaborate high- 
level surveying unit. 

“Guns,” Morrison said, eyes 
wide with apprehension. “They’re 
taking in weapons. But who’s go- 
ing to use them?” 

“They are,” O’Neill answered. 
He indicated a movement to their 
right. “Look over there. This is 
something we hadn’t expected.” 
They were seeing the first fac- 
tory representative move into 
action. 

As the truck pulled into the 
Kansas City settlement, Judith 
hurried breathlessly toward them. 
Fluttering in her hand was a strip 
of metal-foil paper. 

“What is it?” O’Neill demand- 
ed, grabbing it from her. 

“Just came.” His wife strug- 
gled to catch her breath. “A mo- 
bile car — raced up, dropped it 
off — and left. Big excitement. 
Golly, the factory’s — a blaze of 
lights. You can see it for miles.” 
O’Neill scanned the paper. It 



86 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was a factory certification for the 
last group of settlement-placed 
orders, a total tabulation of re- 
quested and factory-analyzed 
needs. Stamped across the list in 
heavy black type were six fore- 
boding words: 

ALL SHIPMENTS SUSPENDED 
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE 

Letting out his breath harshly, 
O’Neill handed the paper over 
to Perine. “No more consumer 
goods,” he said ironically, a nerv- 
ous grin twitching across his face. 
“The network’s going on a war- 
time footing.” 

“Then we did it?” Morrison 
asked haltingly. 

“That’s right,” O’Neill said. 
Now that the conflict had been 
sparked, he felt a growing, frigid 
terror. “Pittsburgh and Detroit 
are in it to the finish. It’s too late 
for us to change our minds, now 
— they’re lining up allies.”

l^OOL morning sunlight lay 
^ across the ruined plain of 
black metallic ash. The ash 
smoldered a dull, unhealthy red; 
it was still warm. 

“Watch your step,” O’Neill 
cautioned. Grabbing hold of his 
wife’s arm, he led her from the 
rusty, sagging truck, up onto the 
top of a pile of strewn concrete 



blocks, the scattered remains of 
a pillbox installation. Earl Perine 
followed, making his way care- 
fully, hesitantly. 

Behind them, the dilapidated 
settlement lay spread out, a dis- 
orderly checkerboard of houses, 
buildings and streets. Since the 
autofac network had closed down 
its supply and maintenance, the 
human settlements had fallen 
into semi-barbarism. The com- 
modities that remained were 
broken and only partly usable. 
It had been over a year since 
the last mobile factory truck had 
appeared, loaded with food, tools, 
clothing and repair parts. From 
the flat expanse of dark concrete 
and metal at the foot of the 
mountains, nothing had emerged 
in their direction. 

Their wish had been granted — 
they were cut off, detached from 
the network. 

On their own. 

Around the settlement grew 
ragged fields of wheat and tat- 
tered stalks of sun-baked vege- 
tables. Crude handmade tools 
had been distributed, primitive 
artifacts hammered out with 
great labor by the various set- 
tlements. The settlements were 
linked only by horse-drawn cart 
and by the slow stutter of the 
telegraph key. 

They had managed to keep 
their organization, though. Goods 
and services were exchanged on a 



AUTOFAC 



87 



slow, steady basis. Basic com- 
modities were produced and dis- 
tributed. The clothing that 
O’Neill and his wife and Earl 
Perine wore was coarse and un- 
bleached, but sturdy. And they 
had managed to convert a few 
of the trucks from gasoline to 
wood. 

“Here we are,” O’Neill said. 
“We can see from here.” 

“Is it worth it?” Judith asked, 
exhausted. Bending down, she 
plucked aimlessly at her shoe, 
trying to dig a pebble from the 
soft hide hole. “It’s a long way 
to come, to see something we’ve 
seen every day for thirteen 
months.” 

“True,” O’Neill admitted, his 
hand briefly resting on his wife’s 
slim shoulder. “But this may be 
the last. And that’s what we 
want to see.” 

TN the gray sky above them, a 
swift circling dot of opaque 
black moved. High, remote, the 
dot spun and darted, following 
an intricate and wary course. 
Gradually, its gyrations moved 
it toward the mountains and the 
bleak expanse of bomb-rubbled 
structure sunk in their base. 

“San Francisco,” O’Neill ex- 
plained. “One of those long-range 
hawk projectiles, all the way 
from the West Coast.” 

“And you think it’s the last?” 
Perine asked. 



“It’s the only one we’ve seen 
this month.” O’Neill seated him- 
self and began sprinkling dried 
bits of tobacco into a trench of 
brown paper. “And we used to 
see hundreds.” 

“Maybe they have something 
better,” Judith suggested. She 
found a smooth rock and tiredly 
seated herself. “Could it be?” 

Her husband smiled ironically. 
“No. They don’t have anything 
better.” 

The three of them were tensely 
silent. Above them, the circling 
dot of black drew closer. There 
was no sign of activity from the 
flat surface of metal and con- 
crete; the Kansas City factory 
remained inert, totally unrespons- 
ive. A few billows of warm ash 
drifted across it and one end was 
partly submerged in ruble. The 
factory had taken numerous di- 
rect hits. Across the plain, the 
furrows of its sub-surface tunnels 
lay exposed, clogged with debris 
and the dark, water-seeking ten- 
drils of tough vines. 

“Those damn vines,” Perine 
grumbled, picking at an old sore 
on his unshaven chin. “They’re 
taking over the world.” 

Here and there around the fac- 
tory, the demolished ruin of a 
mobile extension rusted in the 
morning dew. Carts, trucks, 
search-bugs, factory representa- 
tives, weapons carriers, guns, 
supply trains, sub-surface projec- 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tiles, indiscriminate parts of ma- 
chinery mixed and fused together 
in shapeless piles. Some had been 
destroyed returning to the fac- 
tory; others had been contacted 
as they emerged, fully loaded, 
heavy with equipment. The fac- 
tory itself — what remained of it 
— seemed to have settled more 
deeply into the earth. Its upper 
surface was barely visible, al- 
most lost in drifting ash. 

In four days, there had been 
no known activity, no visible 
movement of any sort. 

“It’s dead,” Perine said. “You 
can see it’s dead.” 

O’Neill didn’t answer. Squat- 
ting down, he made himself com- 
fortable and prepared to wait. 
In his own mind, he was sure 
that some fragment of automa- 
tion remained in the eroded fac- 
tory. Time would tell. He ex- 
amined his wristwatch; it was 
eight-thirty. In the old days, the 
factory would be starting its 
daily routine. Processions of 
trucks and varied mobile units 
would be coming to the surface, 
loaded with supplies, to begin 
their expeditions to the human 
settlement. 

Off to the right, something stir- 
red. He quickly turned his at- 
tention to it. 

A SINGLE battered ore-gath- 
ering cart was creeping clum- 
sily toward the factory. One last 



damaged mobile unit trying to 
complete its task. The cart was 
virtually empty; a few meager 
scraps of metal lay strewn in its 
hold. A scavenger . the metal 
was sections ripped from de- 
stroyed equipment encountered 
on the way. Feebly, like a blind 
metallic insect, the cart ap- 
proached the factory. Its progress 
was incredibly jerky. Every now 
and then, it halted, bucked and 
quivered, and wandered aimless- 
ly off the path. 

“Control is bad,” Judith said, 
with a touch of horror in her 
voice. “The factory’s having 
trouble guiding it back.” 

Yes, he had seen that. Around 
New York, the factory had lost 
its high-frequency transmitter 
completely. Its mobile units had 
floundered in crazy gyrations, 
racing in random circles, crash- 
ing against rocks and trees, slid- 
ing into gullies, overturning, 
finally unwinding and becoming 
reluctantly inanimate. 

The ore cart reached the edge 
of the ruined plain and halted 
briefly. Above it, the dot of black 
still circled the sky. For a time, 
the cart remained frozen. 

“The factory’s trying to de- 
cide,” Perine said. “It needs the 
material, but it’s afraid of that 
hawk up there.” 

The factory debated and noth- 
ing stirred. Then the ore cart 
again resumed its unsteady crawl. 



AUTOFAC 



89 




It left the tangle of vines and 
started out across the blasted 
open plain. Painfully, with in- 
finite caution, it headed toward 
the slab of dark concrete and 
metal at the base of the moun- 
tains. 

The hawk stopped circling. 

“Get down!” O’Neill said 
sharply. “They’ve got those rig- 
ged with the new bombs.” 

His wife and Perine crouched 
down beside him and the three 
of them peered warily at the 
plain and the metal insect crawl- 
ing laboriously across it. In the 
sky, the hawk swept in a straight 
line until it hung directly over 
the cart. Then, without sound or 
warning, it came down in a 
straight dive. 

Hands to her face, Judith 



90 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



shrieked, “I can’t watch! It’s 
awful! Like wild animals!” 

“It’s not after the cart,” 
O’Neill grated. 

As the airborne projectile drop- 
ped, the cart put on a burst of 
desperate speed. It raced noisily 
toward the factory, clanking and 
rattling, trying in a last futile at- 
tempt to reach safety. Forgetting 
the menace above, the frantic- 
ally eager factory opened up and 
guided its mobile unit directly 
inside. And the hawk had what 
it wanted. 

TJEMORE the barrier could 
close, the hawk swooped 
down in a long glide parallel with 
the ground. As the cart disap- 
peared into the depths of the fac- 
tory, the hawk shot after it, a 




swift shimmer of metal that hur- 
tled past the clanking cart. Sud- 
denly aware, the factory snapped 
the barrier shut. Grotesquely, the 
cart struggled; it was caught fast 
in the half-closed entrance. 

But whether it freed itself 
didn’t matter. There was a dull, 
rumbling stir. The ground 
moved, billowed, then settled 
back. A deep shock wave passed 
beneath the three watching hu- 
man beings. From the factory 
rose a single column of black 
smoke. The surface of concrete 
split; like a dried pod, it shriveled 
and broke, and dribbled shat- 
tered bits of itself in a shower of 
ruin. The smoke hung for a 
while, drifting aimlessly away 
with the morning wind. 

The factory was a fused, gut- 
ted wreck. It had been penetrated 
and destroyed. 

O’Neill got stiffly to his feet. 
“That’s that. All over with. 
We’ve got. what we set out after 
— we’ve destroyed the autofac 
network.” He glanced at Perine. 
“Or was that what we were 
after?” 

They looked toward the settle- 
ment that lay behind them. Little 
remained of the orderly rows of 
houses and streets of the pre- 
vious year. Without the network, 
the settlement had rapidly de- 
cayed. The original prosperous 
neatness had dissipated; the set- 
tlement was shabby, ill-kept. 



AUTOFAC

“Of course,” Perine said halt- 
ingly. “Once we get into the fac- 
tories and start setting up our 
own assembly lines . 

“Is there anything left?” Ju- 
dith inquired. 

“There must be something left. 
My God, there were levels going 
down miles!” 

“Some of those bombs they 
developed toward the end were 
awfully big,” Judith pointed out. 
“Better than anything we had in 
our war.” 

“Remember that camp we 
saw? The ruins-squatters?” 

“I wasn’t along,” Perine said. 

“They were like wild animals. 
Eating roots and larvae. Sharp- 
ening rocks, tanning hides. Sav- 
agery. Bestiality.” 

“But that’s what people like 
that want,” Perine answered de- 
fensively. 

“Do they? Do we want this?” 
O’Neill indicated the straggling 
settlement. “Is this what we set 
out looking for, that day we col- 
lected the tungsten? Or that day 
we told the factory truck its milk 
was — ” He couldn’t remember 
the word. 

“Pizzled,” Judith supplied. 

“Come on,” O’Neill said. “Let’s 
get started. Let’s see what’s left 
of that factory — left for us.” 

T HEY approached the ruined 
factory late in the afternoon. 
Four trucks rumbled shakily up 



to the rim of the gutted pit and 
halted, motors steaming, tail- 
pipes dripping. Wary and alert, 
workmen scrambled down and 
stepped gingerly across the hot 
ash. 

“Maybe it’s too soon,” one of 
them objected. 

O’Neill had no intention of 
waiting. “Come on,” he ordered. 
Grabbing up a flashlight, he step- 
ped down into the crater. 

The shattered hull of the Kan- 
sas City factory lay directly 
ahead. In its gutted mouth, the 
ore cart still hung caught, but it 
was no longer struggling. Beyond 
the cart was an ominous pool of 
gloom. O’Neill flashed his light 
through the entrance; the tan- 
gled, jagged remains of upright 
supports were visible. 

“We want to get down deep,” 
he said to Morrison, who prowled 
cautiously beside him. “If there’s 
anything left, it’s at the bottom.” 

Morrison grunted. “Those bor- 
ing moles from Atlanta got most 
of the deep layers.” 

“Until the others got their 
mines sunk.” O’Neill stepped 
carefully through the sagging en- 
trance, climbed a heap of debris 
that had been tossed against the 
slit from inside, and found him- 
self within the factory — an ex- 
panse of confused wreckage, with- 
out pattern or meaning. 

“Entropy,” Morrison breathed, 
oppressed. “The thing it always 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



hated. The thing it was built to 
fight. Random particles every- 
where. No purpose to it.” 

“Down underneath,” O’Neill 
said stubbornly, “we may find 
some sealed enclaves. I know 
they got so they were dividing 
up into autonomous sections, try- 
ing to preserve repair units in- 
tact, to reform the composite fac- 
tory.” 

“The moles got most of them, 
too,” Morrison observed, but he 
lumbered after O’Neill. 

Behind them, the workmen 
came slowly. A section of wreck- 
age shifted ominously and a 
shower of hot fragments cascaded 
down. 

“You men get back to the 
trucks,” O’Neill said. “No sense 
endangering any more of us than 
we have to. If Morrison and I 
don’t come back, forget us — don’t 
risk sending a rescue party.” As 
they left, he pointed out to Mor- 
rison a descending ramp still par- 
tially intact. “Let’s get below.” 

OILENTLY, the two men pass- 
^ ed one dead level after an- 
other. Endless miles of dark ruin 
stretched out, without sound or 
activity. The vague shapes of 
darkened machinery, unmoving 
belts and conveyer equipment 
were partially visible, and the 
partially completed husks of war 
projectiles, bent and twisted by 
the final blast. 



“We can salvage some of that,” 
O’Neill said, but he didn’t actu- 
ally believe it. The machinery 
was fused, shapeless. Everything 
in the factory had run together, 
molten slag without form or use. 
“Once we get it to the sur- 
face . 

“We can’t,” Morrison contra- 
dicted bitterly. “We don’t have 
hoists or winches.” He kicked at a 
heap of charred supplies that had 
stopped along its broken belt 
and spilled halfway across the 
ramp. 

“It seemed like a good idea at 
the time,” O’Neill said as the two 
of them continued past the va- 
cant levels of inert machines. 
“But now that I look back, I’m 
not so sure.” 

They had penetrated a long 
way into the factory. The final 
level lap spread out ahead of 
them. O’Neill flashed the light 
here and there, trying to locate 
undestroyed sections, portions of 
the assembly process still intact. 

It was Morrison who felt it 
first. He suddenly dropped to his 
hands and knees; heavy body 
pressed against the floor, he lay 
listening, face hard, eyes wide. 
“For God’s sake — ” 

“What is it?” O’Neill cried. 
Then he, too, felt it. Beneath 
them, a faint, insistent vibration 
hummed through the floor, a 
steady hum of activity. They had 
been wrong; the hawk had not 



AUTO FAC 



93 



been totally successful. Below, in 
a deeper level, the factory was 
still alive. Closed, limited opera- 
tions still went on. 

“On its own,” O’Neill mut- 
tered, searching for an extension 
of the descent lift. “Autonomous 
activity, set to continue after the 
rest is gone. How do we get 
down?” 

The descent lift was broken off, 
sealed by a thick section of metal. 
The still-living layer beneath 
their feet was completely cut off ; 
there was no entrance. 

TRACING back the way they 
had come, O’Neill reached 
the surface and hailed the first 
truck. “Where the hell’s the 
torch? Give it here!” 

The precious blowtorch was 
passed to him and he hurried 
back, puffing, into the depths of 
the ruined factory where Mor- 
rison waited. Together, the two 
of them began frantically cutting 
through the warped metal floor- 
ing, burning apart the sealed lay- 
ers of protective mesh. 

“it’s coming,” Morrison gasp- 
ed, squinting in the glare of the 
torch. The plate fell with a clang, 
disappearing into the level be- 
low. A blaze of white light burst 
up around them and the two men 
leaped back. 

In the sealed chamber, furious 
activity boomed and echoed, a 
steady process of moving belts, 



whirring machine-tools, fast- 
moving mechanical supervisors. 
At one end, a steady flow of raw 
materials entered the line; at the 
far end, the final product was 
whipped off, inspected and cram- 
med into a conveyer tube. 

All this was visible for a split 
second; then the intrusion was 
discovered. Robot relays closed 
as automatic reflexes came into 
play. The blaze of lights flickered 
and dimmed. The assembly line 
froze to a halt, stopped in its fu- 
rious activity. 

The machines clicked off and 
became silent. 

At one end, a mobile unit de- 
tached itself and sped up the wall 
toward the hole O’Neill and Mor- 
rison had cut. It slammed an 
emergency seal in place and ex- 
pertly welded it tight. The scene 
below was gone. A moment later 
the floor shivered as activity re- 
sumed. 

Morrison, white-faced and 
shaking, turned to O’Neill. 
“What are they doing? What are 
they making?” . 

“Not weapons,” O’Neill said. 

“That stuff is being sent up — ” 
Morrison gestured convulsively 
— “to the surface.” 

Shakily, O’Neill climbed to his 
feet. “Can we locate the spot?” 

“I— think so.” 

“We better.” O’Neill swept up 
the flashlight and started toward 
the ascent ramp. “We’re going to 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



have to see what those pellets are 
that they’re shooting up.” 

T HE exit valve of the conveyor 
tube was concealed in a tangle 
of vines and ruins a quarter of a 
mile beyond the factory. In a 
slot of rock at the base of the 
mountains, the valve poked up 
like a nozzle. From ten yards 
away, it was invisible; the two 
men were almost on top of it 
before they noticed it. 

Every few moments, a pellet 
burst from the valve and shot up 
into the sky. The nozzle revolved 
and altered its angle of deflection; 
each pellet was launched in a 
slightly varied trajectory. 

“How far are they going?” 
Morrison wondered. 

“Probably varies. It’s distribu- 
ting them at random.” O’Neill 
advanced cautiously, but the 
mechanism took no notice of him. 
Plastered against the towering 
wall of rock was a crumpled pel- 
let; by accident, the nozzle had 
released it directly at the moun- 
tainside. O’Neill climbed up, got 
it and jumped down. 

The pellet was a smashed con- 
tainer of machinery, tiny metallic 
elements too minute to be ana- 
lyzed without a microscope. 
“Not a weapon,” O’Neill said. 
The cylinder had split. At first 
he couldn’t tell if it had been the 
impact or deliberate internal 
mechanisms at work. From the 



rent, an ooze of metal bits was 
sliding. Squatting down, O’Neill 
examined them. 

The bits were in motion. Mi- 
croscopic machinery, smaller 
than ants, smaller than pins, 
working energetically, purpose- 
fully — constructing something 
that looked like a tiny rectangle 
of steel. 

“They’re building,” O’Neill 
said, awed. He got up and prowl- 
ed on. Off to the side, at the far 
edge of the gully, he came across 
a downed pellet far advanced on 
its construction. Apparently it 
had been released some time ago. 

This one had made great 
enough progress to be identified. 
Minute as it was, the structure 
was familiar. The machinery was 
building a miniature replica of 
the demolished factory. 

“Well,” O’Neill said thought- 
fully, “we’re back where we 
started from. For better or worse 
... I don’t know.” 

“I guess they must be all over 
Earth by now,” Morrison said, 
“landing everywhere and going 
to work.” 

A thought struck O’Neill. 
“Maybe some of them are geared 
to escape velocity. That would be 
neat — autofac networks through- 
out the whole universe.” 

Behind him, the nozzle con- 
tinued to spurt out its torrent of 
metal seeds.

Reaching the ultimate secret

I follow it up with an encore? 



Illustrated by JOHNS 



BOUT THIS thing, I 
couldn’t stand to have 
them laugh. Not the way 
they did about the swimming. 

“Oh, come now. No one could 
learn to swim by reading a book. 
Five-eighths of a mile the first 
time in the water!” 



And they laughed. I guess I 
laughed, too. More than any 
other thing, I’ve wanted people 
to be happy. But I never swam 
again — only that first time. 

I’ve always read a lot and 
sometimes things I’ve read do 
get mixed up with things I’ve 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




96 



done. But the things still hap- 
pened — they happened to some- 
one. And people ought to believe. 

I’d like to tell people now. I’d 
like to say, “I died once.” 

But if they laughed, it might 
be later and I’d never hear them. 
Already there are too many si- 
lent things in this. There must 
be no silent laughter as well. 

They might think I’ve got my- 
self all mixed up with things I’ve 
read. Things like surgeons pump- 
ing life into a heart to bring the 
patient back after he’s died on 
the operating table. Doctors re- 
viving dead soldiers, if they 
haven’t been gone too long. 

It’s not like that at all. I was 
truly dead — for three days. It 
was almost too long; I suppose 
I made it back just in time. I 
don’t know. 

My reading was what started 
me on this, just the same as with 
the swimming. When I think 
about it too much, I almost feel 
myself that I am exaggerating a 
bit. 

But I have proof, proof which 
no one has ever seen but the 
doctors and those who found me. 
See how they keep me swathed 
in these cloths and how the dark- 
ened room hides my eyes? 

Anyway, I’d be ashamed to 
show myself, for the mark of 
death is too terrible and people 
would be even more afraid of 
dying than they are now. 



'VT OU SEE, I could have done 
-*■ it in the winter, only I was 
worried about the cold. I might 
not have been able to get back 
at all. But it was too warm when 
I chose to do it. I should have 
known better. I’ve read a lot 
about keeping things. You can’t 
preserve them in the hot weather; 
that’s why the doctors put those 
dead soldiers in ice chests, but I 
didn’t think about it enough. I 
made some other mistakes, too, 
but I couldn’t have known. 

I guess what started it all was 
something I read a long time ago, 
perhaps in a story, or an agricul- 
tural bulletin, or maybe in an en- 
cyclopedia. Anyhow, it was some- 
thing about pigs being able to 
just die if they want to. 

That always stuck in my mind. 
It’s a pretty wonderful thing, you 
know. Imagine just being able to 
die if life didn’t seem worth liv- 
ing, or if you were lonely, or 
maybe just because you wanted 
to. 

Oh, I told lots of people about 
it. You know how sometimes a 
lull comes in a conversation. 
Then I’d say, “Pigs are able to 
just up and die if they want to.” 

But nobody ever paid any at- 
tention to me at all. They seemed 
to ignore the remark. One man 
did say once, “What the hell are 
you talking about?” but even he 
wouldn’t listen when I tried to 
explain.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Perhaps it was just too im- 
probable. Besides, people don’t 
like to think about death. They 
talk about it sometimes and 
sometimes they brood about it, 
but they never really think. It 
has always been too unknown 
and that frightens them. Then 
they only fear and stop thinking. 

It always did seem sad to me 
that no one had ever tried to 
help people out about death. Yes, 
I know one did. He died and 
came back — but then He wasn’t 
just a man like you or me. And 
even He never said exactly what 
it was like. 

I wondered if anyone really 
ever had said. So I began to read 
with only a single purpose in 
mind. I had to know so I could 
tell people. If they could only 
know, then they wouldn't have 
that fear and we could talk of 
death and still be able to laugh. 

But I had read it all when I 
read of Jacob’s dream, for that’s 
all there was — dreams, visions, 
hopes. No one had ever seen and 
come back to tell the others. 

The question then was why, 
not what. It couldn’t be that all 
who died had no whole being to 
return to. Not every death is 
marked by a body completely 
uninhabitable. I myself had heard 
a doctor say, “There is nothing 
organically wrong now. The pa- 
tient will recover if only he has 
the will to live.” 



The will to live! Suddenly I 
knew I had found the way. I my- 
self would go and see and return 
to tell them all. 

T ANSWERED all the require- 

ments. I had a healthy body 
to return to. I had the will to 
live, for I enjoy my reading and 
acquaintances. And I alone had 
thought it wonderful that pigs 
can die when they merely want 
to. 

I knew that I could, too, and 
I was not afraid. Very carefully, 
I began what seemed almost too 
simple preparations. 

Drawing some money from an 
account I kept for medical ex- 
penses (at the time I thought 
this very amusing), I bought an 
electric clock which registered 
the hour and the day of the 
month on cylinders like those on 
a tachometer. I felt I would want 
to know exactly how long I had 
been deceased when I came back. 

Next I secured a small round 
mirror with a concave face, the 
type some use for shaving. This 
I was to hang directly above my 
face. It was merely vanity on my 
part, for I wished to say that I as 
well as Lazurus’s friends had 
seen a dead man rise. I had as- 
sumed that at first my vision 
might be blurred and thus the 
magnifying effect of this particu- 
lar glass would, I thought, help 
me focus on my face. 



CAUSE OF DEATH 



99 



On my study floor, I prepared 
a pallet. It was neither soft nor 
hard, just a comfortable support 
for the body I was to leave. Be- 
side it I arranged a basin of 
water and some soft cloths, for 
I would want to wash right after 
coming back. 

You see, I did not fear the 
obvious. My power lay in thought 
and I proceeded systematically. 

Drawn blinds and two small 
night-lights spread a gray cast 
over the room, a cast that I was 
to know too well. 

Everything was ready now. No, 
wait! Quickly I placed a tumbler 
and a decanter of brandy within 
easy reach and by them laid a 
pencil and a pad of paper. It was 
when I straightened up that I 
first felt the pounding in my body. 
My heart pulsed as if it were 
smashing waves of blood through 
my veins. In my throat, the large 
arteries swelled with pressure un- 
til I thought I would strangle. 

I had to have some physical 
exertion to relieve the tension. I 
felt I might faint or have a stroke 
unless I moved about. My father 
had been stricken with an em- 
bolism at about my age, and I’ve 
read such weaknesses are in- 
herited. 

So I walked about the house 
rechecking the locks of windows 
and doors. Perhaps it was just 
to keep busy for a few more 
moments that I even rechecked 

too 



the pads of cardboard with which 
I had muffled the bell-clappers 
on both telephone and door 
chime. I don’t seem to have had 
many callers for several years 
now, but I had to avoid any 
chance of being disturbed. 

COME WHAT calmed by my 
^ exertion, I prepared to lie 
down, but a sentimental whim 
moved me like an automaton to- 
ward the window. It was the 
only really unreasoning thing I 
did. 

Like a prisoner denied the 
light on penalty of torture, I 
knelt down and looked under the 
blind. Never was the Sun so daz- 
zling. This slightest lifting of the 
shade poured onto me a warmth 
that I had never known before. 

An old saying, invading my 
mind, destroyed the illusion, and 
laughing a bit nervously at “seek- 
ing his place in the Sun,” I turned 
away and lay down. 

The dials on my new calendar 
clock registered 3:15, July 12. 
Reaching for my pad and pencil, 
I recorded this and then, refold- 
ing my hands across my chest, 
I lay quite still. 

The heat of the day had begun 
to saturate the closed room. Out- 
side, all was quiet, as if the Sun 
had mesmerized the world. The 
insect hum of the electric clock 
was the only clue of life around 
me. 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Looming large above me in 
the mirror, the magnified reflec- 
tion of my face calmed my mind 
with its placidity. Great-lidded 
Buddha eyes gazed down, hold- 
ing in their glow my first under- 
standing of Nirvana. 

I knew that it had come. I had 
reached the boundary where the 
fear of returnless going stopped 
the psyche just this side. 

My only body consciousness 
was the heavy thud . thud . 
thud of blood being driven 
through my veins. I toyed with 
stopping the thudding, feeling 
and savoring the pause between 
those sledge-hammer strokes on 
my brain — knowing that any 
one of those pauses lengthened 
to eternity was death. 

Suddenly I shrieked and sat 
upright. For an instant, my body 
had completely stopped and I 
had known it. Only a nameless 
grasping fear had snatched me 
back. 

My heart beat wildly as I 
gasped for air. With shaking 
hands, I poured a drink and 
gulped it down. It had been close. 

Still trembling, I arose and 
slumped into a chair. I had to 
organize myself, to think my way 
along this thing. 

What had happened to me? 

This one thing I knew: I could 
do it. I could stop my body at 
will and I had done it, if only for 
a second. 



This thought reassured me or 
perhaps the brandy opened my 
reserve of courage, for I had been 
sitting in the chair some time. 

VjjTITH caution, I approached 
the pallet. I regarded it 
with suspicion, as though there 
were a deadly scorpion in its 
folds. Then, jeering at my hesita- 
tion, I lay down and composed 
myself as before. The clock said 
5:05. I stirred again only to 
record this on the pad. 

Despite my nervousness, things 
proceeded faster this time. A mor- 
bid excitement carried me along 
the path I now already knew. 
And at its end, I flirted with the 
stopping. Going over and step- 
ping back, going over and step- 
ping back. 

It was a pleasure exquisite and 
unique. Once felt, it was unre- 
sistable. 

I was no longer afraid. I did 
not have to be. I could stop my 
body and start it at will. So I 
let it slip away from me. The 
thuddings ceased and only the 
pauses remained — silent, shape- 
less things in endless procession. 
And then the great silence. It 
flowed over me and I was lost. 

The silence was too heavy and 
my thoughts were not my own; 
they floated up away from me 
in the silence. I could feel them 
go, but there was nothing to bring 
them back. Each thought of pro- 



CAUSE OF DEATH 



101 



test winged its way into a void 
with all the rest. 

And nothing else remained but 
the will to live. As the silence 
lapped around this will, it grew 
until it alone was I. The silence 
washed about it, but it stood. 

Then the little rippings and the 
slicings and the tearings and the 
softening of things were there — 
heard without sound, felt without 
feeling, like the pulling of a tooth 
from a novocaine-deadened jaw. 

It was then I saw the face. 

Have you ever felt the terror 
of suddenly waking with a face 
— a face of eyes — staring into 
your unguarded and bewildered 
first glance? One feels as if this 
face would look into one’s very 
life and wrest it from him. Per- 
haps it is a nascent fear of one’s 
own mask of death. 

But I could not escape the 
mask. It loomed above me with 
gaping maw and staring eyes; 
eyes that seemed more dead and 
deadly as my vision cleared. The 
mirror enlarged the horror that 
lay below it. 

It was the wrench of nausea 
that pulled me from this night- 
mare. In the violence of the 
retching, I rolled from beneath 
the mirror and raised myself to 
hands and knees. I had knocked 
over the clock and it shouted up 
at me — 10:05, July 15. Three 
days! Too long! Too horribly 
long! 

102 



C LOWLY I dragged myself to 
^ the telephone and pulled it 
from the stand. I remember noth- 
ing else until they brought me 
here. 

It’s been eight days — eight 
days away from death, yet I’m 
closer to it now than ever before. 
And I can’t think of it. The fear 
has come crashing through and I 
can’t think. 

This thing, this body is too far 
gone. I won’t be able to make it 
move. I’ll just feel it getting 
away — little by little — ripping 
apart cell by cell, and then every- 
where all at once. 

I can feel it now. But in that 
great silence, I could almost hear 
the tearing — yet there was no 
sound. 

The doctors have given up all 
hope. I can see it in their faces. 
I could hear them talking among 
themselves when they brought 
me in. They had to give it a name. 
There’s a certain safety in a 
name, you know. 

I would have told them, but I 
was afraid they’d laugh. The 
nurses would laugh and say to 
each other, “Have you heard 
what the one in 408 wanted in 
his case history?” 

I couldn’t stand the laughter 
now. 

But that’s the way my chart 
should read — Cause of Death: 
— Death!

W HAT happens if Fido 
and Felix finally real-

bought off with a free meal by 
mankind for the past few thou- 
sand years? The author poses this 
question by presenting a future 
in which an experiment goes awry

groups attain intelligence — mice, 
rats, cats and dogs. 

Having the capacity to reason, 
these natural mutual enemies re-

the enemy of any competitive life- 
form. 

In this disturbing book, one is 
uncomfortably reminded of the 
slender pillars on which our ci-

tion, transport and power. How 
disruptive would gnawed tele- 
phone wires, chewed power-line 
insulation and glass scattered on 
busy highways be if they were 
constant and deliberate acts? As 
the animal becomes able to com-

level, Man must adopt animal 
cunning and brutality in order 
to survive. The way he does it 
quick-freezes the blood! I would

Sohl. Rinehart & Company, Inc., 
$2.75 

T I 'HE story concerns an Ameri- 
ca of forty to fifty years 
hence, thirty years after a suc- 
cessful Communist conquest 
achieved mainly by the use of 
germ warfare. The enemy doctors 
halt the epidemic with pre-pre- 
pared vaccine, but it requires 
monthly booster shots to main- 
tain freedom from relapse, per- 
mitting rigid control of the native 
Americans. It is against this so- 
ciety that Emmet Keyes rebels; 
his weapon . immunity. 

I was afraid at this point that 
I was in for another man-against- 
the-world thriller-diller, but Mr. 
Sohl spared us that. 

My objection to the book is 
the caliber of opposition that the 
hero encounters. I’ll go along with 
us Americans being tough crit- 
ters to hold down, but could de- 
cadence hamstring the enemy in 
only thirty years after conquest, 
even with the super-effective 
booster-shot gimmick that the 
conquerors could hold over the 
heads of the conquered? 

I still had a pleasant time read-

literature would be unfair. Sohl

A W, come on now — this is go- 
ing too far! So help me, this 
opus starts out with our rangy, 
raw-boned hero actually astride 
an old pinto! 

Of course he doesn’t stay long 
in the saddle. He’s light-years 
away in pretty quick order, but 
not before he gets involved in a 
desperate chase, an assassination, 
a temporary tie-up with the Di- 
rector of Communications of the 
company that owns the whole 
Galaxy (incidentally a gorgeous 
tomato), and a weird one-eyed 
parrot and its owner, a fat little 
Chinese who (why did you have 
to do it, fellas?) spouts pidgin 
English. 

After this alarming introduc- 
tion, which scared me into think- 
ing that another Giles Habibula 
was being born, Wu, the Chinese, 
became a pretty interesting char- 
acter. 

None of the others come alive, 
but, then, who’s got time to be a 
character when there's so much 
to do? 

SOLAR LOTTERY by Phillip 
K. Dick; THE BIG JUMP by 
Leigh Brackett. Ace Books, 35c

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



HP HE Big Jump is a fine hunk 
of story about Man’s first try 
for the stars. One of the original 
crew of five returns, comatose 
but with body aquiver with a 
horrid life of its own. A remark- 
able feeling of horror and mys- 
tery is maintained without let- 
down while the hero attempts to 
determine first-hand what has 
happened to the original crew. 

It’s a big-scale story, but it 
still manages to make its people 
human. 

Solar Lottery is something else 
again. It’s a longer story and has 
ten times as much plot, so I 
guess it should be ten times bet- 
ter than its companion story, 
but . 

Anyhow, it concerns a society 
that is founded on the monstrous 
descendants of our present in- 
dustrial giants; a governmental 
setup that uses “teeps” — tele- 
pathic agents; rule-by-chance suc- 
cession that is determined by 
lottery and lots, lots more. Too 
much if you ask me. There’s a 
limit to how many ideas a writer 
can compress into a story. After 
that, it’s profitless squandering. 

TERROR IN THE MODERN 
VEIN, edited by Donald A. Woll-

T HIS volume could be sub- 
titled “Mr. Wollheim Gives 
Up the Ghost.” Says he, “Ghosts 



is dead.” Modern situations and 
frustrations breed modern ter- 
rors. Therefore this ghoulish goul- 
ash of modern toupee-raisers. 

Most of the stories are good, 
particularly “The Crowd” by 
Bradbury and a little shocker, 
“The Rag Thing” by David Gri- 
nell. The two long pieces, “The 
Croquet Player” by H. G. Wells 
and “The Burrow” by Franz Kaf- 
ka are both interesting because 
of the big names involved. “The 
Burrow” particularly is a fine psy- 
chological fable. 

I liked even better the shorter 
works by Heinlein, Leiber, Sheck- 
ley, A. E. Coppard, Matheson and 
Robert Bloch.

since it is meant for the profes-

But it is of interest because it

SPACE CAT VISITS VENUS 
by Ruthven Todd. Charles Scrib-

TTERE’S something I’ve been 
hoping for — a natural, age 
group 9 to 12. It doesn’t at all 
just so happen that I have a 9- 
■ year-old son, Ricky, and a 12- 
year-old daughter, Sandy, and I 
was getting tired of having them 
around at their present age levels 
until something came along for 
them to review. 

Ricky: “I enjoyed Space Cat 
Visits Venus very much. The 



idea of a cat in a space story I 
think is very unusual! You don’t 
often read about a cat in space. 
Venus itself was really some- 
thing! On Venus there was only 
one type of animal, a sort of 
mouse. These mice were very 
important to the plants of Venus. 
Just like bees to our plants. Venus 
was really mostly plants that 
could communicate with each 
other.” 

Sandy: “I liked the book. It is 
about Flyball, a space cat, and 
Captain Fred Stone’s trip to Ven- 
us. I liked the fact that the plants 
were the intelligent beings on 
Venus and not the animals. Now 
when I do my gardening, I won- 
der if perhaps my flowers are 
talking about me and what they’re 
saying. I hope they like me. I like 
them.” 

Well, that’s this month’s allow- 
ance taken care of.

Warrior's 

Return 



By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

Hibbs wasn't the first man to come back 
from the wars with a chip on his shoulder 
. only his reached from here to Mars! 



T HE SILVER and blue 
cross-country bus reached 
the outskirts of town and 

slowed. 

“Is there any special place you 
want to get off, sir?” the bus 
driver asked. 

“This will do nicely,” Hibbs 
said. 



With great gentleness, the 
driver braked his enormous vehi- 
cle to an imperceptible stop, as 
though he were transporting ni- 
troglycerin instead of people. The 
gesture wasn’t lost on the passen- 
gers. 

They recognized it as the 
driver’s mark of respect, his

genuflection to the famous Mr. 
Hibbs. 

“Is he getting off here?” 

“Shh! He’ll hear you!” 

“But why here?” 

“This is where he lived before 
the war.” 

“And why did he come by 
bus?” 

As the bus came to its imper- 
ceptible stop four blocks from 
the center of town, Hibbs stood 
up and lifted his worn leather 
suitcase from the baggage rack. 
Every man in the bus noticed 
how tall and stooped and skinny 
he was, how homely, how tired- 
looking. They’d be able to tell 
their friends all about him. And 
the women made notes of Hibbs’ 
unbecoming steel-rimmed glasses 
and his cheap, unpressed suit, the 
coat of which they could estimate 
within a few dollars. 

No one spoke as he gave his 
ticket stub to the driver. 

“It’s been a great pleasure hav- 
ing you, Mr. Hibbs,” the driver 
said, operating the door lever. 
“Ah — Mr. Hibbs, could I ask 
you a question, sir?” 

Hibbs smiled vaguely, pretend- 
ing he didn’t hear. He started 
down the steps. 

The driver said, “Would you 
mind telling me why you came 
by bus, sir, instead of the other 
way?” 

Hibbs shook his head and 
walked down the steps. 

108 



“Mr. Hibbs,” the driver said, 
“could I have your autograph? 
My little boy — ” 

Hibbs hurried away from the 
bus. 

“Freak!” the driver shouted. 
The bus roared away. 

Hibbs wiped perspiration from 
his forehead and found that his 
hands were shaking. He began to 
walk toward town. 

An old pickup truck came by. 
Lettered on its battered side was 
Tommy’s Auto Repairs. The 
driver slowed, stared at Hibbs 
and stamped on the gas pedal. 
The truck picked up speed, its 
ancient engine knocking furious- 
ly. The driver glanced back once, 
then hunched over the wheel. 

Welcome home, Hibbs thought. 

r T , HE PICKUP truck screeched 
^ to a stop in front of Joe’s 
Bar. Tommy Burke climbed out, 
glanced up the block and hurried 
into the bar. 

“Hey, guess who’s in town!” he 
yelled. 

Joe’s Bar resembled a cavern. 
The dirty windows were forever 
shuttered and the light that fil- 
tered through had a cold, unreal, 
phosphorescent quality, as though 
there were no light outside at all. 
No matter what the time, it was 
always midnight in Joe’s Bar, 
midnight on the longest night in 
the year. 

The three drinkers had a night 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



look, too. Their leaning bodies 
fitted cunningly against the bar, 
as though shaped for that pur- 
pose. Their feet were intricately 
twined in the brass rail, in a 
manner no human feet should 
assume. They looked like fixtures, 
like simulated humans that Joe 
might have bought to keep him 
company. 

“Well, guess who’s back in 
town,” Tommy Burke repeated. 

The bartender put down his 
newspaper and said, “Burke, 
don’t come shouting in here like 
that.” 

“Give me a beer,” Burke said, 
“and guess who’s in town.” 

“Abraham Lincoln?” hazarded 
Jim Mathis. 

“Alexander the Great?” asked 
Stan Dearborn. 

“Julius Caesar?” said Eddie 
Fleet. 

“Here’s your beer,” Joe the 
bartender said. 

Burke took a deep gulp and 
wiped his mouth. “Frank Hibbs 
is back in town.” 

“Huh?” 

“You’re kidding!” 

“Hibbs wouldn’t come back 
here!” 

“He’s here,” Burke said. 

“Where?” 

“Walking down Main Street.” 

“Walking?” The three men un- 
coiled their feet from the brass 
rail, rushed to the door and 
peered out. They came slowly 



back to the bar and ordered. 
“Another beer.” 

“Make it two.” 

“Better give me a shot. It is 
Frank Hibbs!” 

At that, Willie Day came out 
of the men’s room. “You say 
Frank’s back?” 

“I drove right by him,” Burke 
said. 

“So why didn’t you stop and 
give him a lift?” Day asked. 

B URKE scratched his head. “I 
didn’t think of it. You don’t 
give Frank Hibbs a lift just like 
that. What was I supposed to do, 
stop and say, ‘Hop in, Frank,’ 
like he was just anybody? He 
didn’t have to walk if he didn’t 
want to.” 

“You was scared,” the bar- 
tender said, winking at the three 
drinkers. 

“I was not!” 

“Sure you was — a big, strong 
boy like you.” 

“Well, I ain’t scared of you,” 
Burke said sullenly, folding his 
muscular, grease-stained arms 
across his chest. “You big, flabby 
meatball.” 

“No offense,” the bartender 
said, winking again at the drink- 
ers. “So our home-town hero has 
returned.” 

“Think he’ll show us his 
medals?” Mathis asked. 

“Frank was never no showoff,” 
Willie Day said, looking like a

fighting rooster with his red- 
rimmed eyes and bristling gray 
hair. 

“No, not much,” Mathis snort- 
ed. “Him and his great big brain.” 

“You can’t blame him for be- 
ing smart,” Day argued. 

“I reckon we’d of won the war 
without him.” 

“Don’t be too sure of that,” 
Day said. “Just what you got 
against him?” 

“I hate freaks,” Mathis said. 
“I’d like to boot his tail out of 
town for him.” 

“Why don’t you try?” asked 
Day. “You’re about twice his size, 
Jim. Go ahead and you try.” 

“You can’t fight a guy like 
that,” Mathis grumbled. “In a 
fair fight, I could beat him. Arid 
I can lick you any old time.” 

“Say, Tommy,” the bartender 
broke in, “what was Hibbs wear- 
ing?” 

“Business suit,” Burke said, 
puzzled. 

“Did he have on a hat?” 

“I don’t think so. Why?” 

“I kinda thought he might be 
wearing a Buck Rogers space 
helmet,” Joe answered. 

Everyone except Willie Day 
roared with laughter. 

“I don’t like it,” Stan Dearborn 
said. “Whenever Hibbs is here, 
someone gets hurt. I think we 
should ask him politely to leave 
town. We could get up a deputa- 
tion — ” 



“You’re forgetting something,” 
Eddie Fleet interrupted, with a 
subtle smile. 

“What’s that?” 

“Frank Hibbs can make us 
rich. You know that, don’t you?” 
He waited until the drinkers had 
nodded. Then he said, “Tommy, 
go out and buy a New York 
Times. I’ll show you what I 
mean.” 

TT IBBS COULD see that the 
town hadn’t changed much. 
Joe’s Bar was as dingy as ever, 
with the blackout shutters still 
drawn. Eddie Fleet’s hardware 
store still had machine-gun marks 
in one wall, from the time the 
Russian plane, miles from its tar- 
get, had strafed everything in 
sight until a Matador brought it 
down. Stan Dearborn’s shoe store 
had a new sign and someone had 
opened a dry-cleaning shop. But 
Mrs. Ganz’s boarding house was 
still there and Taylor’s cigar 
store still had posters of the high 
school football schedule. 

He walked into the cigar store. 
Mrs. Taylor was behind the 
counter, reading a mystery maga- 
zine. She blinked at him through 
her bifocals and cried. “My good- 
ness! Frank Hibbs!” 

“Yes, ma’am,” Hibbs said. 
“Could I have two packs of 
Luckies?” 

Mrs. Taylor just stared at him. 
“Are you back for good, Frank?” 



no 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




“Yes, ma’am. I guess I’m going 
to stay.” 

“Oh, Frank, we’ve been so 
proud of you, most of us. We read 
all about you in the newspapers. 
Imagine a boy from our little 
town becoming famous!” 

“Well, it’s all over,” Hibbs said. 
“I’d rather not talk about it.” 

“I don’t blame you. It must 
have been a frightful experience. 
But I always said you were an 
unusual boy. Do you remember 
how I always spoke up for you 
after your poor parents died?” 
Hibbs smiled faintly. “Yes, of 



course, Mrs. Taylor. How is 
Danny?” 

“Danny is dead. My poor boy 
was killed in that big battle they 
had around Port Arthur. He was 
just an ordinary soldier.” 

“I’m very sorry to hear it.” 
“He was on an actual battle- 
field,” Mrs. Taylor said, “carry- 
ing an actual weapon. No gen- 
erals tried to protect Danny.” 
“Could I have the Luckies?” 
Hibbs asked. 

Mrs. Taylor took out two 
packs and held them absent- 
mindedly in her hand. “Well, I

guess everyone did what they 
could. I always spoke up for you, 
Frank, you know that. I never 
let anyone call you a freak in 
my presence. Why, the main rea- 
son they didn't commit you that 
time was because of my say-so. 
And you’ve certainly showed 
them.” 

“I’m very tired, Mrs. Taylor,” 
Hibbs said. “I’d love to talk some 
other time, but right now — ” 
“Frank,” Mrs. Taylor cut in, “I 
hate to ask you this on your first 
day home, but — ” 

Hibbs held out his hand for 
the cigarettes. Reluctantly Mrs. 
Taylor gave them to him and 
accepted half a dollar. 

“Please listen to me, Frank. 
I’m only asking because you and 
Danny were such friends and I 
always stuck up for you. They 
raised the taxes again on that 
little tiny country place of mine 
and it’s all Joe Walsh’s fault. If 
you spoke to him, Frank — you 
wouldn’t even have to threaten, 
just one firm word out of you — ” 
Hibbs hurried out of the store. 
Mrs. Taylor followed a few steps. 

“Well, perhaps after you’ve 
rested,” she added urgently. “I 
know you won’t forget your old 
friends. Frank, why didn’t you 
wear your uniform? Your news- 
paper pictures were so handsome 
with the uniform. Why didn’t you 
wear it?” 

“That uniform was a joke,” 



Hibbs said bitterly. “I was no 
soldier.” 

He walked across the street to 
Mrs. Ganz’s boarding house. 

1W/TTHIN the dim and cavern- 
ous recesses of Joe’s Bar, 
the drinkers had gathered around 
a two-day-old copy of the New 
York Times, spread out full on 
the bar. They had opened it to 
the financial section. 

“Do you really think he can 
do it?” Dearborn asked. 

“Of course he can,” Eddie Fleet 
said. 

“But will he?” 

“Why not?” Fleet wanted to 
know. “We’re his friends, aren’t 
we? Look, we buy him a couple 
drinks, we talk about high school 
days, then we ask. him to have a 
look at these stock market things. 
He looks, right? Hibbs was al- 
ways crazy about numbers. And 
we’re his friends, right?” 

“Fine friends,” Willie Day said. 

“And then we ask him which 
stocks are going up. It’s as simple 
as that. All he has to do is say, 
‘Minnesota Mining’ or ‘Dakota 
Uranium.’ A couple of words!” 

“All he has to do is point,” the 
bartender said. “He don’t have 
to speak at all if he don’t want 
to.” 

“He’ll never do it,” Day in- 
sisted. 

“Two minutes of his valuable 
time, that’s all it’ll take,” Fleet 



112

said. “How in hell can he say no?” 
Jim Mathis shook his head. 
“But are you really sure he’ll 
know? Even those electric brain 
things they got in Washington 
and Harvard can’t do that.” 
“They can, too,” Tommy Burke 
argued. 

“If they can,” Mathis asked, 
“how come those professors ain’t 
rich? Answer me that one!” 

“Look,” the bartender said, 
“Frank can outthink those ma- 
chines. He did it during the war, 
the early part, before they found 
out what else he could do.” 

“He won’t do it,” Willie Day 
told them. “Look, a million people 
must have asked him for favors 
by now. Everybody knows what 
he can do.” 

“But this is his home town,” 
Fleet said. “This is different. He 
wants to live here. He wants us 
to say what a wonderful job he 
did. That’s what he wants. That’s 
why he came back.” 

Day shook his head emphati- 
cally. “Frank came back because 
he doesn’t have any other place 
to go. I guess he’s about the most 
famous man in the country now. 
People won’t leave him alone. I 
think he hoped he could find a 
little peace and quiet here.” 

“In that case, he didn’t think 
very good with that great big 
brain of his,” Mathis said. 

“Come on,” Fleet said, folding 
the T imes. “Let’s hunt him up. 



It’s worth a try.” 

Stan Dearborn said, “Hey, let’s 
take along a fifth. Maybe we can 
soften him up with a drink or 
two.” 

“Good idea.” 

“A fifth of the best, Joe.” 
“Who’s going to pay for it?” 
the bartender demanded. 

“We’ll chip in. We’re all in this, 
aren’t we?” 

“I guess so,” the bartender ad- 
mitted. He slipped a bottle into 
a brown paper bag. “Coming, 
Willie?” 

“No.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because you guys are crazy. 
You go up to Frank like that, 
there’s going to be trouble. Some- 
one’s going to get hurt.” 

“You’re just chicken, Willie,” 
Burke said. 

lyf ARIE GANZ had seen Hibbs 
enter town and had just had 
time to change into a freshly 
pressed cotton dress, brush her 
hair and touch up her lipstick. 
She opened the front door of the 
boarding house for him. 

“Well, Frank!” 

“Hello, Marie,” Hibbs said. 
“How are you?” 

“Fine,” Marie replied. “I guess 
I’ve grown up a little since you 
were here last.” 

“Yes, you have. You were a 
pretty little girl then . .” 

“And now?” 



WARRIOR'S RETURN 



113 



“You’re a pretty woman.” 
Hibbs coughed nervously. “Is 
your mother here?” 

“She’s in the hospital,” Marie 
said. “Her stomach again.” 

“I’m sorry to hear that.” 

“But she kept your room all 
through the war, just like you 
asked. And I cleaned and dusted 
it every day. It’s just the way 
you left it.” 

“That’s fine,” Hibbs said. “I 
think I’ll go up now.” 

But he hesitated. Marie was 
half blocking the doorway. He 
would have to brush past her to 
enter the boarding house. 

“The sheets are clean and 
fresh,” Marie said. “And I made 
sure nothing was ever moved.” 
“Thank you,” Hibbs said. 

“I know how you feel about 
your personal things. I wouldn’t 
of let anyone touch them.” 

“Well, thanks.” 

“You look tired, Frank. You 
ought to have some fun, now that 
you’re back. Go out dancing and 
things.” 

“Would you like to go dancing 
with me?” Hibbs asked. 

“Sure. I’d love to, Frank.” 
“You wouldn’t feel — strange, 
being seen out with me?” 

“Of course not, silly!” 

r I ^ HERE WAS an awkward si- 
-*■ lence. Then Marie asked, 
“What are you going to do now, 
Frankie?” 



“Nothing much,” Hibbs said. 
“A little painting . 

“Painting? You?” 

“Most definitely me.” 

“But, Frank, you could make 
millions!” 

“I’m just going to do a little 
painting.” 

“I guess you can afford to,” 
Marie said. “They must of paid 
you well in the war. I’ll bet you 
got more than those generals. 
You should of, after all you did!” 

Hibbs smiled vaguely, brushed 
past her and slowly started up 
the stairs. 

Marie said, “Frank — ” 

“Yes, Marie?” 

“I hate to bother you at a time 
like this. I hate to ask anything 
of you — ” 

“Later, perhaps,” Hibbs said 
moving up the stairs. Hurriedly, 
this time. 

“Frank, it’s Mother’s stomach. 
I don’t think the hospital is doing 
her any good. And it costs so 
much! It’s unbelievable how 
much it costs.” 

“The doctors know what 
they’re doing,” Hibbs said. 

“Wouldn’t you cure her, 
Frank?” 

Hibbs turned on the stairs. “I 
can’t do anything like that.” 

“I know you can,” Marie said. 
“You cured Mother’s tumor that 
time. I know she wasn’t supposed 
to tell anyone, but I am her 
daughter.”

“I’m through! I’m through with 
all that. I’m just an ordinary hu- 
man being now. I’m going to be 
a painter — ” 

“Oh, Frank,” Marie begged, 
“you could just flick your fingers 
and it’d be done.” 

“Don’t you understand? I can’t 
arbitrate. I can’t pick and choose. 
If I give to one, I must give to 
all. And I can’t give to all. I did 
what everybody asked me once, 
but now I’m sick of being differ- 
ent. I’m my own man now and 
I want to be like everyone else!” 
“You won’t do it? A little thing 
like that?” 

“I can’t!” 

“I shouldn’t think it would dis- 
turb you so much.” Marie said. 
“After what you did.” 

Hibbs had turned pale. He 
stared at Marie. 

“Oh, you can kill, kill, kill, if 
someone important asks you to. 
But you won’t cure one little sick- 
ness. Well, I wouldn’t be seen 
out with a freak like you.” Marie 
was shouting now. 

Hibbs walked slowly down the 
stairs, toward the front door. 

Marie said, “I’m sorry, Frank. 
I shouldn’t have said that. It just 
slipped out.” 

Hibbs opened the door. 

“Will you come back? I don’t 
renlly think you’re a freak, 
Frankie — ” 

Hibbs closed the door behind 
him. 



TIE SAT ON A bench in the 
town’s little park. Two boys 
came over and stared at him. 

“Hey, you’re Hibbs, aren’t 
you?” 

“Sure, he’s the guy. Hey, Mr. 
Hibbs, what did it feel like in 
space?” 

“Lonely,” Hibbs said. 

“Was it hot or cold?” 

“Neither.” 

“How long did you stay?” 

“Not long. It was exploratory.” 
“How did you breathe?” 

Hibbs didn’t answer. 

“Bro -ther! What was it like on 
Mars?” 

“Lonely.” 

“Boy! Hey, how about doing a 
trick for us?” 

“Yeah, show us some of your 
stuff. Come one!” 

Hibbs rubbed his eyes. 

“C’mon, mister. Do something!” 
The drinkers from Joe’s Bar 
came up in a compact group, 
blinking in the sunlight. 

“You kids scram,” said Fleet. 
“Go on, scram. Hiya, Frankie.” 
“Hello, Eddie,” Hibbs said. 
“You remember all the boys, 
don’t you?” 

“Sure,” Hibbs said. “Hello, Joe, 
Jim, Stan — I don’t believe I 
know this gentleman.” 

“I’m Tommy Burke. I was a 
couple years behind you in 
school. But I remember you, Mr. 
Hibbs.” 

“Sure has been a long time 



WARRIOR'S RETURN

since high school days,” Jim 
Mathis said. “Buy! Remember 
those days, Frank?” 

“I remember them,” said Hibbs. 

“We was all great pals then,” 
Joe said. 

Hibbs smiled. 

“Oh, sure,” Dearborn said, “we 
razzed you a little, Frank, be- 
cause you were different. But we 
really did like you.” 

“That’s a fact,” Fleet added. 
“No friends like the boyhood 
friends, eh, Frankie?” 

“I guess that’s true,” Hibbs 
agreed. 

“Things were always lively 
when you were here, Frankie. 
That time you burned down old 
man Thompson’s shed. What did 
you call it?” 

“Poltergeist manifestation,” an- 
swered Hibbs. 

“Yeah! They almost put you 
away, huh? But you showed ’em 
all. All those profs at Harvard 
and Duke — then the top Army 
brass — you showed ’em!” 

“I should have kept my mouth 
shut,” Hibbs said. “I was an idiot.” 

“How about a drink for old 
times’ sake?” Joe asked, taking a 
bottle out of a brown paper bag. 

“Thanks, but I can’t drink,” 
Hibbs said. “My metabolic make- 
up ...” 

“That’s okay, Frankie. We’ll 
drink to you. Here’s to Frankie 
Hibbs, the hometown boy who 
made good.” Joe opened the bot- 



tle and drank, and passed it 
around. 

jC'DDIE FLEET rustled his 
newspaper. 

“Say, Frankie,” Jim Mathis 
said, “You were always a hotshot 
with numbers, weren’t you?” 

Hibbs didn’t answer. 

“Well,” Mathis went on, “me 
and the boys have been thinking 
of taking a little flyer on Dakota 
Uranium. Here it is here.” He 
pushed the newspaper at Hibbs. 
“What do you think, Frankie?” 

“It’s a highly speculative 
stock,” Hibbs said, not looking at 
the newspaper. “I wouldn’t, if I 
were you.” 

“Yeah? Well, thanks a lot, 
Frank. That saves us some money 
right there. What stock do you 
think we should buy?” 

“I don’t know,” Hibbs said. 

“Sure you do,” said Fleet. “We 
read in the papers about how 
you could predict any individual 
stock, if you wanted to. You 
worked it all out for fun once. 
Just a matter of understanding 
the stock market cycle, you told 
the reporters.” 

“I can’t tell you,” Hibbs said. 
“You can see that, can’t you? If 
I tell one person, I’d have to 
tell — ” 

“Don’t hand us that, Frankie,” 
Mathis said. 

“I won’t do it,” Hibbs said. 
“When I was younger, I didn’t 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



mind doing things for people. I 
got a kick out of it, enjoyed it. 
I didn’t think it would turn out 
this way. I liked being differ- 
ent then, but it has to stop now. 
I’m the only one of my kind and 
there’s no place for me.” 

“You mean you won’t help us 
out?” Eddie Fleet asked. 

“Can’t you see my position?” 
Hibbs pleaded. 

“You won’t help out your old 
friends,” Dearborn said sadly. 

“I can’t!” 

They turned to go. Mathis 
murmured softly, “Dirty freak.” 

Hibbs stood up. “What did you 
say?” 

“Nothing,” Mathis said. 

“Go on, say it.” 

“All right then, I will,” Mathis 
said. “You’re a freak, a dirty 
freak. And you’re a murderer, too. 
How many of them did you kill, 
Frankie, sitting in your office in 
Washington and thinking? A mil- 
lion, two million? You aren’t 
human!” 

“You’re right,” Hibbs said, “I’m 
not really human. I’m a sport, the 
only one of my kind, absolutely 
unique and unduplicatable. And 
all of you envy me and hate me, 
but you still have to ask favors 
of me. Like a fool, I did what you 
asked during the war, because I 
thought you were my people. But 
you’ll never leave me alone, will 
you? You’ll never forgive me.” 

“Don’t get excited, Frankie,” 



Fleet said, taking a step back. 

“I’m not excited. I’m hopelessly 
tired and lost. Where can I go? 
What can I do? It’s the same 
everywhere. ‘Do this for me, Mr. 
Hibbs, do that, Mr. Hibbs. Per- 
form this tiny miracle for me, 
Mr. Hibbs.’ And if I don’t — ‘You 
dirty freak, Mr. Hibbs.’ You want 
miracles? You really want to see 
miracles?” 

“Take it easy, Frankie,” the 
bartender said. 

“Sure, I’ll give you miracles!” 
Hibbs told them. “Want to see 
me fly?” Abruptly he levitated 
himself fifty feet into the air and 
came down again. “That’s how I 
went into space. Want to see me 
make fire?” 

“Frank, please!” 

T^IRE LEAPED from Hibbs’ 
fingertips, scorching the 
ground in front of them. They 
turned to run and suddenly found 
themselves surrounded by a roar- 
ing circle of flames. 

“That’s how I make fire!” 
Hibbs shouted. “What other little 
exhibitions would you like? Tele- 
portation?” 

Mathis and Fleet were sud- 
denly lifted off their feet and 
hurled to the ground. They 
scrambled up, ashen white, gasp- 
ing, hands over their faces to 
shield them from the circle of 
flame. 

“What else can I do for you?” 



WARRIOR'S RETURN 



117 



cried Hibbs. “I’m practically un- 
limited, you know, a real, genuine 
superman. Maybe you’d like to 
see how I control supersonics? 
Shall I level this town for you, 
as I leveled Stalingrad? Or may- 
be you want to know what really 
happened to the Russian Fourth 
Army? I’ll show you!” 

A blackness formed over the 
heads of the men, expanded, 
grew, began to envelop them. 

“Frank!” Mathis yelled, run- 
ning into the street. “For God’s 
sake, Frank!” 

The blackness disappeared. 
The flames vanished. 

“All right,” Hibbs said, and 
levitated. “I’m going. To hell with 
you and your lousy race.” 

“Damn him!” grated Dearborn. 
“He might have killed us!” 

“I knew there’d be trouble,” 
Mathis said. “He isn’t even hu- 
man.” 

“But where’s he going now?” 
asked Tommy Burke. 

“Mars, Venus, the Moon — 
who cares?” Dearborn said. 
“Wherever he goes, he’ll be alone. 
Superman — he can have it!” 
The figure of Frank Hibbs, 
two hundred feet in the air, hesi- 
tated, stopped, came down along- 
side Willie Day. Hibbs looked 
puzzled. Day was sitting on the 
ground with his arms on his knees 
and he had a sad, pitying expres- 
sion. 

“You didn’t run,” said Hibbs. 



“No,” Willie Day said. 

“You weren’t afraid I might 
hurt you, even kill you?” 

“Not really.” 

“Why?” asked Hibbs, bewild- 
ered. “Ive done more killing than 
any one man in history. Why did 
you think I’d stop at another?” 
Day gave his head a single 
shake. The pitying look never 
left his face. “They were the 
enemy. You knew what they 
stood for and you were right in 
hating them. You knew I didn’t 
want anything like that, so you 
wouldn’t kill or even hurt me. 
And there’s something else . .” 
“What?” demanded Hibbs. 
“You’re human. Maybe anoth- 
er step up, but human all the 
same. And you’ve been made to 
think you’re a computer. I guess 
you are in a lot of ways, but 
there’s one thing you didn’t com- 
pute.” 

H IBBS SAT down beside him. 
“What’s that?” 

“You’re not the only one with 
a special talent. There are plenty 
of people like that — scientists, 
artists, mechanics, gardeners with 
green thumbs.” 

“So?” Hibbs prompted. 

“You think you can’t help any- 
body if you can’t help everybody. 
Does a surgeon figure that way? 
Does a green-thumb gardener re- 
fuse to work because he can’t 
take care of everybody’s garden?”

Hibbs was silent for a long 
while as the other men slowly 
came back from the street. “I 
hadn’t thought — ” he began, and 
stopped. He turned sharply on 
Willie Day. “Softsoap! You’re 
after something! What is it?” 
“Nothing,” said Day. “For my- 
self, that is. For you.” 

“You’re crazy. What could I 
want that I can’t do?” 

“Stop thinking of yourself as 
a freak. You can’t do that alone. 
You need help. All right, you’ve 



got friends right here in town who 
can help.” 

Hibbs stared around at the 
others. They nodded sheepishly. 

“What about a — a drink?” 
Tommy Burke invited. 

“You know something?” said 
Hibbs. “I’ve never had one with 
the boys. I’d — well, I can’t think 
of anything I’d like better.” 

Day got up and brushed him- 
self off. “Why not?” he asked. 
“You’re only human.”

Next month, James H. Schmitz's serial THE TIES OF EARTH con- 
cludes in a way that not enough stories manage to achieve — it leaves 
you wishing it hadn't ended. But the problem has been tinglingly estab- 
lished, the clues given and hunted down, the danger encountered in all 
its ferocity, the tangled ties of Earth snaked through or cut — and where 
can a story go from there except to its exciting conclusion? But one 
still can't help wishing . 

Oh, well, there's the consolation of Alan E. Nourse's BRIGHTSIDE 
CROSSING, a novelet of a dreadful adventure that can't possibly suc- 
ceed — and yet must be undertaken. History is full of such necessary 
doomed exploits. The oddity is that so many of them escaped inevitable 
catastrophe and did what they set out to do. But can this one? When 
you read the frightening roster of perils and balance it against the few 
things in favor of winning, we guarantee you won't rush to the $100 
window to lay down a bet that the story ends happily. And don't 
construe this to mean it does — or doesn't. Just wait and see, and then 
think whether you'd have done the same as the men who had to go 
along. Chances are that you would; some jobs have to be done, no 
matter what the risk. 

Another novelet to go with THE TIES OF EARTH and BRIGHTSIDE

Take Redfern's advice and do not get mixed 

up with fearless people cast in the heroic 
mold . , they can really put on the squeeze! 

BY CHARLES SATTERFIELD 



I T WASN’T a pillory, exactly, 
but it served a pillory’s pur- 
pose. “For God’s sake!” Red- 
fern yelled. “Careful with that 
bear trap!” 

His Fnit torturers didn’t speak 
English, but they understood 
what Redfern was communicat- 
ing in a writhing scream. They 
chattered at each other like 



crickets on a summer night and 
eventually took away the toothed, 
spring-clamped, murderous-look- 
ing trap and replaced it with 
coils of wire, with which they 
bound him to the frame. The 
wire was tight, but not, Redfern 
assured himself consolingly, as 
tight as the trap would have been 
on his legs and neck.

WITH REDFERN ON CAPEllA XII 



121 







Next came the tar. At least it 
looked like tar and served tar’s 
purpose, though it smelled like a 
swamp at low water. “Ouch!” 
roared Redfern; it was hot. Then 
the flaky pumice grit, for unfor- 
tunately the Fnits had no feath- 
ers — unfortunately for Redfern, 
that is; the pumice had a way of 
rubbing him raw that feathers 
could never have matched. 

Then the Fnits chattered at 
each other for a moment thought- 
fully and finally left him alone. 

It was time for them to gather 
faggots for the blaze. 

"O EDFERN squinted over his 
shoulder at Capella, slowly 
drifting toward the horizon be- 
hind him. He had about an hour 
before sundown. It all depended 
on whether or not they found 
enough burnable wood before 
dark. The insect-legged Fnits 
were strictly daylight animals; 
when their planet got cold at 
night, they were tunneled in their 
warm, damp cities underground. 

Capella XII was not a very 
fertile planet, at least not this far 
north, and there might be much 
suitable wood within easy carry- 
ing distance, Redfern told him- 
self. There weren’t any big trees 
at all; he could see that for him- 
self. And that was pretty hope- 
ful. Why, it was ten minutes al- 
ready and the fuel-gatherers 
weren’t back yet, not even with 



the first load. His chances of last- 
ing past the sunset, he calculated 
shrewdly, were at least five or 
six to one, and that meant that 
he would live until morning — 
of course, if he didn’t freeze dur- 
ing the night. 

Fourteen hours! It seemed 
like forever. 

Someone coughed behind him. 
“Pardon me,” said a voice — a 
human voice! “Would you be in- 
terested in a job?” 

Redfern jerked against the 
cables. “Who — who the devil 
are you?” he demanded, craning 
to see. 

A man stepped apprehensively 
out from behind the pillory. “My 
name,” he said swiftly, staring 
about, “is Di Candia. My, ah, 
associates and I noticed that you 
appeared to be in difficulties and 
we thought that you might — ” 

“Tell me later!” Redfern snap- 
ped. “Get me down off here be- 
fort the Fnits come back!” 

“Surely,” said the man agree- 
ably. “However, I should warn 
you that the pay might be, well, 
uncertain, since ours is a specu- 
lative — ” 

“Di Candia,” begged Redfern, 
“cut me down!”

■*- cave on the mountainside, 
where Redfern slept more joy- 
ously than he had slept in years. 
At daybreak, the man named Di

Candia nudged Redfern awake. 
“We might as well get started,” 
he said cheerfully. “It’s a long 
way into the city — ” 

“Not yet,” objected Redfern. 
“The Fnits will be sniffing around 
after me like dogs in a garbage 
dump. Give them a chance to get 
discouraged.” 

“Oh, do you think that’s neces- 
sary?” Di Candia blinked at him 
thoughtfully. “Well, I suppose 
you know best. After all — ” he 
nudged Redfern jovially — 
“you’re our expert on Fnits, and 
if we can’t take your advice, what 
are we paying for?” 

Redfern nodded. “Exactly,” he 
said. “What are you paying me 
for?” 

“Oh, it’s a simple task, Mr. 
Redfern. My, ah, associates and 
I have business here on Capella 
XII. We need someone familiar 
with the local customs.” 

Redfern said sourly, “That’s 
me, all right. If I were any more 
familiar with the customs, I’d be 
dead. Are these your associates?” 
“All but one.” Di Candia 
made the introductions. “General 
Glick.” A red-faced man, ostensi- 
ble age about fifty, though it was 
hard to tell these days. “Mr. Cow- 
per.” A pale-faced stripling. “And 
Miss Garney, who is not present. 
We represent a, well, syndicate 
which is anxious to do business 
on this planet.” 

“You never will,” said Red- 



fern positively. “The Fnits don’t 
like humans. They won’t have 
any business dealings.” 

“We happen to think they will. 
After all, they tolerated you for 
nearly a year.” 

Redfern sighed. “They toler- 
ated me as long as I stuck to my 
spaceship. But the first time I 
wandered into town, they grab- 
bed me.” 

“Because you were in the 
harem of the Glow,” Di Candia 
supplied. 

Redfern looked at him thought- 
fully. “Been keeping an eye on 
things, haven’t you? Well, yes, I 
was. But how was I to know? 
The Fnits ignored me; I walked 
into a building; it turned out to 
be the wrong building. Next 
thing I knew, I was on the moun- 
tainside.” 

“But nevertheless,” General 
Glick cut in ponderously, “you 
were there, my boy. Were you 
not?” 

“I was.” 

“And you can go there again?” 

“I can. I won’t.” 

The general looked helplessly 
at Di Candia, who said smoothly: 
“Not even for transportation off 
Capella XII? Not even if the 
alternative is going back to the 
stocks?” 

Redfern looked unbelievingly 
at Di Candia. “What the devil 
do you want with the Glow’s 
harem? Take it from me, you 



WITH REDFERN ON CAPELLA XII 



123 



wouldn’t be interested!” 

“That,” said Di Candia, “is our 
problem. You take us there; we 
do the rest.” 

S EVERAL HOURS later, the 
party was toiling toward the 
Fnit city. The general was in the 
lead, puffingly reminiscing. “It 
was on just such a morning as 
this,” he said to the party at 
large, “that I shot thirty and a 
half couple of snipe before break- 
fast on Glencouley. The wind 
was from the southeast, perhaps 
a touch east, and I looked like 
being high gun until — ” 

“Please, General,” said Di 
Candia. “We’ll attract attention.” 
They were only fifty yards from 
the Fnit highway, across a rise; 
they could hear the clatter of 
unicycles streaming along it. 

“Time for a break,” said Cow- 
per — almost his first words 
since Redfern had joined the 
party. Without discussion, Di 
Candia and the general stopped 
in their tracks and sat down. 

Redfern leaned against a 
boulder and lit a cigarette, swel- 
tering. Capella itself was a billion 
miles away, farther than Saturn 
from Sol, but it was hot under 
the fur hoods. All of them were 
thirty or forty pounds heavier 
because Capella XII’s gravity was 
twenty per cent or so higher 
than Earth’s; walking was hard 
work. 



Redfern debated casting off 
the furry parka, but it was im- 
portant to keep his face shielded 
as much as possible in case a 
Fnit should notice them and 
recognize the late prisoner of the 
pillory. Of course, with not more 
than a couple of dozen humans 
on the whole planet, it wouldn’t 
be much of a feat to track him 
down, but the Fnits were strange 
— they didn’t show much disposi- 
tion toward method. They would 
be as likely as not to ignore the 
humans, unless they happened to 
see Redfern himself. 

General Glick sighed heavily. 
“Lunch looks like being late,” he 
mentioned, scowling with the ef- 
fort of thought. “Could do with 
a bit of it, too.” 

“We’ll eat when we get back to 
the ship,” said Di Candia harshly. 
The general looked bleak and 
frustrated. 

Redfern shut his mouth like a 
prudent man. His new employers 
were an odd lot, but, as they had 
pointed out, he was in no posi- 
tion to be choosy. He sighed and 
flipped his cigarette away. The 
Fnit planet had seemed like such 
a good idea, back on Earth. New- 
ly discovered, virgin territory for 
commercial exploitation, it had 
looked like the perfect way to 
recoup fortunes for a man with a 
spaceship and no ties. 

No doubt the, ah, syndicate 
had felt much the same; but Red- 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



fern could predict no glowing fu- 
ture for them. His own experience 
was distinctly negative. First the 
months and months of trying to 
get the Fnits to pay attention to 
him; then the unfortunate inci- 
dent when they did. 

Of course, he was a loner and 
these people numbered at least 
four. Perhaps they were better 
equipped; certainly they ap- 
peared to be better financed. 

nPHEIR SHIP proved that, 
when they got to it. It was 
a monster, for a private vessel, 
thrice the size of Redfern’s an- 
cient blowtorch. It had the look 
of a Navy rocket, outmoded and 
sold to civilians with political 
pull. But even with pull, the 
Navy’s castoffs don’t come cheap, 
and the fuel bill for any rocket 
capable of carting tons of payload 
around space is a big item in any- 
body’s budget book. 

Redfern’s practiced eye took 
in the ship’s fittings — Golightly 
converter for faster-than-light 
flight, self-contained atmosphere 
regenerator, even that unqualified 
luxury, a radio communications 
set, utterly useless except when 
within orbiting range of an in- 
habited planet because of the 
torpor of radio-wave speed. In 
the ledger of his mind, the total 
was astonishing. 

The fifth member of the party, 
the Miss Garney, joined them at 



the ship. She was, by Redfern’s 
estimate, the most utterly gor- 
geous piece of femininity a gra- 
cious Maker ever put on a planet. 
She came into the ship’s lock like 
Aphrodite emerging from the 
waves, and Redfern’s adrenals 
buckled down to heavy-duty 
pumping. 

She said meekly, “Things are 
coming along. My Fnit con- 
tact — ” 

“Miss Garney!” thundered Di 
Candia. He looked meaningfully 
at Redfern and said, “Step into 
the pilot-chamber with me and 
report. I don’t want to have to 
caution you about security again.” 

Redfern stared after them. It 
was a moment before he noticed 
that his fists were clenched and 
his whole body in a position of 
combat. 

He looked dazedly at young 
Cowper and the general. Cowper 
was playing an intricate form of 
six-deck solitaire and the general 
was relaxed in a plush armchair, 
holding a brandy-and-splash, ob- 
viously dreaming of keepered 
moors and screamers against a 
rainy wind. Were they men or 
mice, Redfern demanded furious- 
ly of himself, that they could 
stand silent while a crude, rude 
oaf like Di Candia browbeat so 
lovely a thing as Miss Garney? 

And what was she doing along 
on a job like this, anyway? Back 
on Earth was where she belonged, 



WITH REDFERN ON CAPELLA XII 



125 



with Titans of industry and the 
crowned heads of South America 
fighting to drink champagne from 
her slipper; back on the TV 
screens of the world, or the front 
pages of the newspapers. Not in 
an out-of-the-way planet of a 
God-forsaken star, where the en- 
tire human population could 
nearly be counted on the fingers 
and toes and the non-human 
population had no eye for mam- 
malian beauty. 

Put a name to it: Redfern was, 
just like that, in love. 

1TE FELT like a fool in the 
false Santa Claus beard, but 
Miss Garney had insisted on it. 

“According to my Fnit con- 
tact,” she said in a voice like the 
chiming of mellow gongs, “they 
think of you as Warm Blood with 
Freckles. They’ll never think of 
spotting you under a false beard, 
particularly if we dye your hair.” 

Redfern was less positive, but 
if Miss. Garney wanted it that 
way, that was the way it would 
be. Besides, it meant just the two 
of them going into the Fnit city 
alone — except, of course, for 
the Fnits, which hardly counted 
as competition. 

They took the long serpentine 
tunnel down into the Fnit city, 
lit with pale greenish fire from 
the rock ceiling, and walked un- 
noticed through the scurrying 
Fnits. 

126 



If you’ve seen one Fnit, you’ve 
seen them all: insect-legged, hu- 
man-sized, heads like moldy 
skulls. They could learn to speak 
English, in a way — a few of 
them had, when the first explor- 
ing spacer roared down. But few 
of them bothered, and no human 
had ever learned to speak Fnit. 
The Fnits didn’t bother about 
their human and other extrastel- 
lar visitors at all, as a matter of 
fact. Live and let live was their 
motto — until one of their un- 
invited guests crossed the sharp 
and invisible line of taboo. Then 
they crossed out the “let live” 
part of the motto and began 
gathering faggots. 

Redfern, remembering, loos- 
ened his collar. “Let’s get this 
over with,” he whispered to Miss 
Garney. 

“They don’t understand you,” 
she said conversationally, with a 
mellow, sympathetic smile. “Don’t 
worry. Where did you say the 
harem was?” 

Redfern said rebelliously: 
“That’s your word, not mine. All 
I know is that it belongs to the 
chief, what they call the Glow 
of All the Fnits, and they grabbed 
me when I walked in.” 

“It’s the harem,” Miss Garney 
said sunnily. “Trust my — con- 
tact for that.” 

“How did you make a con- 
tact?” Redfern demanded. “Heav- 
en knows, I tried for a year and 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



they wouldn’t give me a tumble.” 

“Oh, that was Sir Vivian’s 
work.” 

“Sir Vivian?” 

“Major-General Sir Vivian 
Mowgli-Glick. You wouldn’t 
think it to look at him, but he’s 
quite an expert at making con- 
tact with, well, native races. 
Learned it in India.” 

TJEDFERN stared at her. He 
had been in India; in Cawn- 
pore, where the steel mills 
belched smoke and fire day and 
night; in Madras, where the big 
TV studios provided entertain- 
ment for the whole world; on the 
Bengali coast, where the casinos 
attracted the idle rich of the 
whole Solar System. 

“In India?” he asked. 

“Some time ago,” she ex- 
plained. “The general is older 
than he appears.” 

“He’d have to be.” That was 
one of the troubles with life these 
days, Redfern grumbled to him- 
self. Six months in the rejuvenat- 
ing clinic and an octogenarian 
came out as young-looking as he 
liked. 

Naturally, the biochemists 
were careful to call it a “cosmetic 
change,” for they didn’t really 
make a man younger. They only 
restored the elasticity of the skin 
with hormone injections, shored 
up the crumbling bone structure 
with chelate ion-exchange, then 



patched up worn organs and 
spruced up useful ones, drained 
the accumulated poisons from the 
brain and nervous system, gen- 
erally tightened up the loose neu- 
ronic connections and refurbished 
ancient joints. Of course, age left 
its marks. A man of 200 could 
never be the man he’d been at 
150, but — “cosmetic change!” 

It was like jacking up the- 
rotor-cap on a senile Model-J 
copter and rolling a 2088 Super- 
Jetmaster underneath it. 

Figure it out: It was late Nine- 
teenth Century or so when any- 
one could call the Indians a “na- 
tive race,” which meant that the 
general must have been nearly 
a hundred when the rejuvenation 
clinics opened up. Which would 
make him — 

“Older than hell,” growled Red- 
fern. He himself was a good 
fifty years from his first rejuvena- 
tion, which accounted for some 
of his prejudices. Like most 
juniors, he rather resented the 
clinics. Without them, the world 
wouldn’t be bulging as precari- 
ously at is was, the drive into 
interstellar space wouldn’t be as 
urgent . and people like Red- 
fern wouldn’t find themselves pil- 
loried by black-shelled monsters 
like the Fnits. 

Miss Garney was explaining: 
“ — brought along a stock of 
beads and baubles and so on. 
Trade goods, you know. But Sir

Vivian found out something that’s 
been very useful, Mr. Redfern. 
Sugar. The Fnits are fond of it. 
Oh, not to eat, of course — I 
suppose it would poison them or 
turn them green or something. 
But they make a sticky syrup 
and cement the cracks in their 
shells. They never get wet, so — ” 
“There it is,” hissed Redfern, 
jerking his chin at a sphincter- 
shaped doorway. “That’s where 
they grabbed me. The harem.” 
“Oh!” she squealed. “Lovely. 
It’s just lovely, Mr. Redfern!” 

To Redfern, it looked like any 
other Fnit dwelling, only bigger. 
The honeycombed rock passages 
of the Fnit city were not con- 
structed for sweeping views. One 
entrance looked much like any 
other entrance, apart from minor 
differences in design. The essen- 
tial difference in design between 
this and any other was the loung- 
ing pair of Fnits at the entrance; 
to Redfern, the last time he had 
come this way, it had seemed 
they might be doormen to a 
public building. It had taken only 
a few seconds to find out they 
were guards. 

1%/fISS GARNEY was making 
careful notes in a little book. 
“ — three, four, five, sixth en- 
trance down from that public 
drink fountain or whatever it is,” 
she counted. “Sort of hexagonal 
sign over the entrance. Good.” 



She closed the notebook and 
smiled meltingly at her escort. 
“The general won’t have much 
trouble locating it. Now we’ve got 
a couple of hours to kill. Would 
you like to look around the 
town?” 

Something was bothering Red- 
fern. “Why would the general 
want to locate it?” he asked un- 
easily. 

“Oh, I don’t know.” Miss 
Garney looked charmingly vague. 
“Something about trade relations 
— he really doesn’t tell me much. 
Oh, Mr. Redfern, what a charm- 
ing sight! Let’s go look at it!” 

The “charming view” was the 
Fnit equivalent of a kiddies’ 
swimming pool, a sort of dusty 
sandbox, where soft-shelled little 
Fnits, just past the larval stage, 
rolled around and threw dust in 
the air and chattered to each 
other. But Redfern wasn’t bored; 
he had a charming sight of his 
own to look at. 

While Miss Garney was tour- 
ing the Fnit city, Redfern was 
admiring the lovely way her head 
sat on her neck, and the remark- 
able grace with which her supple 
fingers scratched the end of her 
thin, lovely nose. He thought 
dazedly of his library of pinups, 
the telestars and S-girls, back in 
the ship; but they blurred and 
grayed in his memory in com- 
parison with Miss Garney. He 
didn’t even know her first name! 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



But his adrenals whispered it to 
his central nervous system and 
his pounding heart agreed it was 
true: “She’s beautiful!” 

By the time they got back to 
the ship, Redfern was hinting 
broadly about cottages and wed- 
ding rings. But he stopped short 
as they approached the ship. 

“Good Lord,” he said, turning 
white. “They’ve found out where 
I am!” 

The base of the ship was ringed 
with Fnits, a dozen of them, clut- 
tering violently at each other. 

Miss Garney patted his arm. 
“Don’t worry,” she soothed. “It’s 
time for their handout. The gen- 
eral usually takes care of it. It 
gives him pleasure.” 

A ND THAT was what it was, 
because as they drew near, 
the baselock opened and General 
Sir Vivian Mowgli-Glick stood 
beaming in the hatch, a carton in 
one hand. “Here, sir!” he com- 
manded, and tossed little white 
envelopes of sugar at the Fnits. 
“Yours, sir. No, no, you with the 
red collar — you’ve had your 
share, I say!” 

Redfern and the girl pushed 
their way through the Fnits into 
the ship. The general, with one 
last scattering toss of sugar, fol- 
lowed. 

“Dirty little beggars,” he said 
with satisfaction. “Reminds me 
of the Dogras in Srinagar. It was 



the Fifty-third Rifles at the time 
and we’d just come up from the 
Vale. Bless me, I was only — ” 
“Shut up,” said Cowper from 
behind his everlasting solitaire. 
“Did you find the place, Miss 
Garney?” 

The girl nodded. “Mr. Redfern 
was most helpful.” She smiled at 
Redfern. 

“All right,” said Cowper, and 
slammed the cards down on the 
table. “Let’s go. Glick, Di Candia 
— you come with me. Garney, 
entertain our associate here. We 
won’t be long.” 

And they left. Redfern looked 
warily at the girl. 

“Well,” she said brightly, 
“would you like a cup of tea?” 
Redfern cleared his throat. 
“Uh, how long will they, well, be 
gone?” he asked. “I mean — ” 
She laughed. “I know what you 
mean. Have some tea.” She 
opened the galley and expertly 
drew hot water into a pot. “The 
general’s idea,” she said over her 
shoulder. “He cannot abide in- 
stant tea; he insists on tea leaves 
and a pot. It makes quite a spec- 
tacle in free-fall.” 

It was at least half an hour, 
Redfern was thinking, to the Fnit 
city, and half an hour back. So, 
assume they would take at least 
half an hour in the city to do 
whatever they were going to do, 
that meant ninety minutes. He 
glanced at the girl thoughtfully, 



x 1 1

estimating her powers of resist- 
ance. Of course, that was always 
assuming they were really going 
to the Fnit city; but it had to be 
that — 

Miss Garney said: “You rocket 
jockeys, you’re all alike.” She 
picked up the pot of scalding 
water meaningfully and marched 
to the table. “Tea,” she said in a 
voice of command, shoving Cow- 
per’s solitaire cards out of the 
way. 

Redfern scratched his ear and 
sat at the table. It wasn’t the 
first time he had made a faulty 
first approach to a landing and 
had to abort and come in again. 

The girl peeked under the lid 
of the teapot, nodded, and poured. 
“Now,” she said firmly, “we’ll 
have a pleasant chat, won’t we? 
How did you happen to be on 
Capella Twelve, Mr. Redfern?” 

H E SLID HIS chair around 
closer to her. “Well, it’s like 
anything else. Dad ran a fleet of 
charter ships — all rockets, you 
know, just local stuff. Then the 
Golightly drive came along and 
nobody wanted a ship that 
couldn’t make it past Saturn. Dad 
went to the bank and got the 
money to refit the ships, but the 
bank was smarter than he was 
and they wound up with the 
ships, all but one. So we heard 
about the big opportunities out 
around here and I came out to 

130 



look for them. I’m still looking. 
Did anyone tell you that your 
eyes are the exact color of 

“That’s very interesting,” she 
said, moving away. “And your 
family is still on Earth?” 

“Oh, I never had any family,” 
said Redfern, absent-mindedly 
moving closer to the sugar, which 
was in front of Miss Garney. 
“Just Dad, I mean. No wife or 
anything like that. But I’ve al- 
ways looked forward to settling 
down and — ” 

“You’ll make me spill my tea,” 
said Miss Garney. “Now why 
don’t you just have a piece of 
cake? We’ve got plenty of time 
for a nice — I mean I don’t know 
exactly when they will be back, 
it might be any minute, but why 
don’t we just chat?” 

She patted her hair back into 
place, looking hunted. “It’s been 
a most interesting trip,” she said 
vivaciously. “Really, I had no 
idea space was so interesting. 
When Sir Vivian approached me, 
I mean, I had the idea that it 
would be just a long, dull thing, 
but actually it’s been terribly in- 
teresting.” 

She made a grab for her bag. 
“Cigarette?” she asked in a bright 
tone, lighting one and holding it 
like a gun between her and Red- 
fern. 

Redfern sighed. “Thanks,” he 
said, lighting one for himself. 
After all, a cigarette only burned

for, he calculated, maybe nine 
minutes. He sat back and re- 
marked conversationally: “So 

this was Sir Vivian’s ide'a, coming 
here?” 

“Oh, yes — his and Mr. Cow- 
per’s and Major Di Candia’s. So 
we formed a syndicate. They had 
the know-how and the actual ex- 
perience. Major Di Candia was 
in business on Iapetus for ever 
so long. And, well, I had the 
money.” She dimpled charmingly. 
“Mummy’s third husband was 
ever so wealthy, you see. So here 
we are.” 

Redfern stubbed out his cigar- 
ette and hitched his chair closer. 

WO HOURS LATER they 
heard a clamor outside. 
“Thank heaven!” said Miss 
Garney, putting down the carv- 
ing knife. 

She opened the lock. Cowper 
and Di Candia and the general 
scrambled in, dragging a chitter- 
ing, protesting Fnit on a rope. 

“Close the port!” bellowed Di 
Candia, and did it himself with- 
out waiting for anyone else to 
make a move. He leaned against 
it, breathing hard. “Well!” he 
said, staring at Miss Garney. “I 
thought we had a rough time, 
but you look like the tag end of 
a battle royal.” 

Redfern cleared his throat, but 
Miss Garney cut in. “Boys will 
be boys,” she elucidated. “What 

132 



happened? How did it work?” 

“Oh, splendid, splendid!” said 
General Glick happily. “There’s 
a complete change of plan, dear 
girl. The most fabulous bit of 
luck, really! We — ” 

“Save your maundering for a 
little later,” snapped Cowper, ty- 
ing the squirming Fnit to a hull 
brace. “Let’s get out of here.” 

“Oh, right,” said the general 
agreeably, and Di Candia snap- 
ped a salute and sat before the 
control board. 

He kicked the ship off the 
ground, balancing it on its t^il, 
drove it staggeringly off for one 
minute to what Redfern guessed 
to be north, then delicately set 
it down again. Di Candia had a 
radar screen to navigate by; the 
rest of those in the ship had 
nothing. But Redfern had the no- 
tion they’d gone not more than a 
mile from the previous landing 
site. It was a masterly job of 
piloting and Redfern looked at 
Di Candia with wonder in his 
eyes. But even so, the captive 
Fnit passed out cold. 

Miss Garney made sympathe- 
tic noises and knelt beside the 
insectoid creature. “Leave him 
alone,” Cowper ordered. “He’s 
less trouble that way. Come in 
here a moment; I want to bring 
you up to date.” 

She nodded obediently and 
left Redfern with the general, the 
major and the Fnit. If he had 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




had to choose among them for a 
companion, he thought morosely, 
it would have been a close deci- 
sion, but he would have given it 
to the Fnit. 

The general took the oppor- 
tunity to gloat: “A masterly rear- 
guard action, Mr. Redfern! In- 
deed, Rommel’s Afrika Korps had 
nothing to teach us. A quick 
pounce and we secure our cap- 
tive; a beautiful disengage* and 
we’re on our way to the ship, with 
the little roaches chasing after 
us and the schooner in sight, 
what? And once aboard the 
schooner and — ” 

Redfern said: “What the devil 
are you up to? Kidnaping? 
Don’t you realize the State De- 
partment will have your hide 
for it?” 

G ENERAL Glick actually put 
one finger alongside his nose. 
“Perhaps there is more to it than 
meets the eye, Mr. Redfern.” 
“There better be,” snarled Red- 
fern. He was just beginning to get 
upset; things had moved too 
quickly for him to react as fast 
as they occurred. “You idiots 
think you can move in on a 
planet and throw your weight 
around without knowing a thing 
about what makes the inhabitants 
tick. Look at the Fnit! See the 
golden bands on his foreleg? That 
means it’s royalty — high royal- 
ty! There are four bands on that 



one, and even the king, the one 
they call the Glow, only has five! 
Why, they’ll rip you limb from 
limb if they catch you!” 

The general chuckled ponder- 
ously. Redfern, disgusted had 
stamped over to the viewport and 
looked out. It was nearly dark. 
That was the only good thing, he 
told himself; the Fnits wouldn’t 
come out at night even to rescue 
royalty. But after the darkness 
would follow the dawn; and 
when the dawn came . 

He rubbed his neck uncon- 
sciously, feeling a sudden pain 
where the neck-clamps had been. 
If they were considerate enough 
merely to pillory and burn us, he 
thought. 

But, he decided, it was not 
hopeless. The Fnits would un- 
doubtedly be out for blood. But 
the humans were in the ship and 
the ship was in shape for flight. 
Nothing could stop them — if 
things got as rough as they surejly 
would — from pushing their Fnit 
captive out of the lock and tak- 
ing off for calmer worlds. He 
winced at the thought of aban- 
doning his own ship, but maybe 
some day, when things cooled 
down, he could come back for it. 
Or, better, send someone for it. 
At any rate, they could surely 
get away with their lives, as long 
as they stayed in the ship. 

Cowper and the girl came back

ship. “All right,” Cowper said to 
Di Candia and General Glick. 
“We’re set.” And he put a hand 
to the baselock door. 

“Hey!” yelped Redfern in dis- 
may, as the other three men 
tramped out. “They’ll tear you 
to pieces! Where the devil do you 
think you’re going?” 

Cowper looked at him coldly. 
“To the Fnit city, of course,” he 
said, and closed the door behind 
him. 

1%/ITSS GARNEY said waspish- 
ly, “Now, Redfern, none of 
those tricks again!” 

“Don’t worry!” he snapped. 
“I’ve got other things on my 
mind. Do you know what the 
Fnits will do to those men? Good 
Lord, woman, you can’t get away 
with kidnaping! Even if we es- 
cape alive, we can’t go home — 
we’d spend the rest of our lives 
in jail for molesting natives!” 
“Oh, I think not,” Miss Garney 
said lightly. “Mr. Redfern, you 
worry too much.” 

“But kidnaping — ” 

“Now, please,” she said matern- 
ally, “we don’t tell you how to 
run your business, so why should 
you tell us how to run ours? I 
don’t deny that Sir Vivian had 
something like kidnaping in mind 
originally. But, as you say, it 
does have its illegal aspect and 
as things turned out, this is much 
better.” 



“Better how?” 

Miss Garney hesitated, then 
looked conspiratorial. “Mr. Cow- 
per would be furious, but — Well, 
you see, we may not have spent 
a year studying the Fnits as you 
did, but we did manage to make 
a few friends. And we discovered 
that the Glow was about to be 
married and Sir Vivian saw the 
possibilities in it at once. Why 
should we not, he said, get the 
Glow’s bride aboard our ship? 
We could then negotiate with 
the Glow. We want trade privi- 
leges; he wants his wife. A simple 
exchange.” She beamed. “Wasn’t 
it clever of Sir Vivian?” 

Redfern gasped: “You mean 
that this Fnit is — ■” 

“Oh, no,” she said reassuringly. 
“Not at all. It was the most won- 
derful bit of luck. Our Fnit con- 
tact gave us an excellent picture 
of the Glow’s bride and of course, 
thanks to you, we knew where 
the harem was. So they all went 
in to get her and — ” Miss 
Garney blushed prettily — “Mr. 
Cowper said they found her all 
right, and she was in the most 
compromising situation. With this 
one right here! Imagine, Mr. Red- 
fern! Practically a queen, on the 
very eve of her marriage to the 
Glow, and she allows herself to 
have a common, vulgar — ” 

“Wait a minute,” Redfern 
begged hoarsely. “What was the 
bit of luck?” 



134

“Why, you can see that, can’t 
you, Mr. Redfern? Sir Vivian is 
going to see the Glow, to tell him 
that we broke up this affair and 
have the fellow here, for him to 
do with as he will; and surely the 
Fnit’s gratitude will — ” 

Redfern had to swallow. He 
couldn’t speak, but he made a 
violent gesture and Miss Garney 
stopped, staring at him. At last 
he got it out in a horrified voice: 
“Miss Garney, didn’t your con- 
tact tell you that the Fnits have 
three sexes?” 

TT TOOK HER a moment to 
get her breath. “You mean,” 
she gasped, “they were all three 
of them going to — Why, the 
dirty little creatures! Good heav- 
ens, Mr. Redfern, if I had known 
it was going to be anything like 
this, I certainly would never 
have — ” 

“Shut up! Let me think!” He 
stared at the captive Fnit, now 
conscious again and staring un- 
readably back at him out of 
faceted eyes. Even the general’s 
original half-witted plan wouldn’t 
work now, he realized; they had 
a fine Fnit captive for trading 
purposes — but the Fnits had 
the general, the major and Mr. 
Cowper. 

“We’ll just have to bluff it out,” 
he said at last. “The question is, 
do you want to come with me or 
stay here?” 



“Come with you where?” 

“Into the Fnit city. Your 
friends will be just about ready 
for a barbecue by now; if some- 
body doesn’t get in there on the 
double, it’ll be too late.” 

Miss Garney said hastily: “Oh, 
I’m coming with you! You cer- 
tainly wouldn’t dream of leaving 
me here with that, would you?” 
Redfern felt wistful. Staying 
with a single Fnit seemed so close 
to Paradise in his eyes, compared 
with invading a hostile city full 
of them. But there wasn’t any 
choice. They bound the captive 
more securely, Miss Garney 
found weapons for them, and 
they left. 

It was all but dark, and dis- 
tant Capella made reddish shad- 
ows all along the route to the 
city. At any rate, Redfern knew 
where the city was. It wouldn’t 
be more than an hour’s tramp to 
get there; in fact, they would pass 
almost beside his own rocket, 
where he had left it — so miser- 
ably long before! — in his ill- 
fated expedition that had wound 
up with him in the stocks, ready 
for burning. 

Maybe, he thought, they would 
be able to stop off at his own 
ship. It wasn’t a patch on the 
“syndicate’s” ship — ancient 
rocket tube with auxiliaries, 
against the trim, compact Go- 
lightly drive that Miss Garney’s 
money had bought; a single com- 



WITH REDFERN ON CAPELLA

partment instead of the plush 
fittings of the bigger ship. But it 
was his own. And if he boarded 
it, there was nothing to stop him 
from taking off, possibly with 
Miss Garney, and leaving the 
idiotic male members of the syn- 
dicate to the fate they had richly 
earned — nothing, that is, but 
his conscience. 

But he didn’t have to argue 
with his conscience. The red- 
tinged shadows were scary but 
empty — all except one. And 
that one held a dozen armed, 
twittering Fnits; and they were 
all over Redfern and the girl in 
the twinkling of an eye; and 
when the “rescue party” reached 
the Fnit city, it was in a cocoon 
of chains.’ 

1 1 ’HEY WERE sweating pro- 
fusely by the time they got 
to the Chamber of the Glow — 
only partly because of the muggy 
damp warmth of the Fnit cities. 

If Redfern and the girl were 
in a cocoon of chains, the major, 
the general and Mr. Cowper were 
entombed. They were in a row 
before a sort of balcony hanging 
from the rock wall and in the 
balcony was the Glow of All the 
Fnits. Looking at him, Redfern 
knew for the first time why he 
had that title. He actually glowed. 
There was a faint radiance all 
about him — radioactivity? 
More likely some chemical effect 

136 



— bioluminescence, like the 
greenish light of a glowworm. 
Only this was pure white. 

There was a Fnit translator 
below him, looking threateningly 
at the newcomers. “Why, Walter,” 
exclaimed Miss Garney. “I didn’t 
know you were connected with 
the — ” 

“Silence!” chittered the Fnit. 
“It is not possible for you to 
speak before the Glow!” 

“Not possible? Why, Walter, 
after all the sugar I’ve given you!” 
Three Fnits advanced on her. 
She stopped scolding the transla- 
tor and only shook her head rue- 
fully. “These Fnits,” she said dis- 
approvingly. 

The Glow began to speak, and 
the sound was like the magnified 
voice of crickets in a summer 
night. He paused and the inter- 
preter Miss Garney had named 
Walter said: 

“You are to die for abducting 
the para-wife of the Glow. Is it 
of interest to you what the man- 
ner of your death may be?” 

“Oh, very much,” piped up 
General Glick, wriggling in his 
chain-mail mummy shroud. “You 
aborigines are always terribly 
clever about that sort of thing, 
aren’t you? Why, once we lost a 
subaltern to the Pathans and 
when they returned his body, it 
was — ” 

“Silence!” twittered the Fnit 
again. “Hear your death. It is fit 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



that you should serve the One 
you abducted. Since she is a para- 
female, a receiver of eggs, you 
shall receive the grubs from her 
eggs, until they hatch.” 

Redfern, with horrid recollec- 
tions of bloated beetles bearing 
the young of digger wasps on 
Earth, croaked: “Wait a minute! 
Let’s talk business. You can’t kill 
us; you’d never find the — the 
para-wife, or whatever you call 
her.” 

Colloquy between the transla- 
tor and the Glow; the translator 
broke into English to say: “It is 
not so, we correct you. We know 
the para-female is in the great 
ship, and we know that you 
walked from the great ship to 
here, and thus it must be near. 
We have only to look for her.” 

“But it’s night!” cried Redfern. 
“You know how we Earthmen 
are — we go about in the night 
and when it’s cold and all the 
time. Why, our ships are as cold 
as the air outside at night; she’ll 
freeze. It won’t do you any good 
to find her if she freezes, will it?” 

TTIS COMMENT caused a 
frenzy of chirping. It dis- 
turbed the Glow; he rose on all 
eight legs and rasped horrend- 
ously at the captives; The trans- 
lator said: 

“You have spoken the truth. 
If the para-female is exposed to 
the night air, she will perish. 



Therefore we shall kill you imme- 
diately.” 

“Hold it!” Redfern yelled as 
the Glow twittered at the Fnit 
guards. “Don’t you want to save 
her?” 

“It is impossible,” the transla- 
tor explained. “You have said 
that she will freeze, and it will 
do us no good to find her when 
she is frozen. We cannot go out 
to rescue her, and if we could, 
she would not survive the trip 
back to the city.” He made a 
motion with his mandibles, the 
Fnit equivalent of a philosophical 
shrug. “It would have been more 
useful to have you receive the 
grubs,” he said regretfully, “but 
without the para-female, that is 
impossible, too, and so — ” He 
beckoned meaningfully to the 
guards. 

“But we can save her!” 

The interpreter asked curious- 
ly, “How?” 

“We can heat our ship if we 
wish, you know. Just allow us to 
go back to the ship and we’ll 
warm it up. In the morning, you 
can come and get her.” 

The translator made the 
equivalent of a nod. “Very inter- 
esting,” he said. “No.” 

“But why?” Redfern demanded. 

“The Glow in his wisdom sees 
that you will escape. It is bet- 
ter that the para-female should 
die than that you should escape. 
There are other para-females.” 



WITH REDFERN ON CAPEllA XII 



137 



“We promise we won’t escape,” 
Redfern said desperately. “We — ” 
He stopped short, mouth open. 
“Well?” asked the Fnit after 
a moment. 

Redfern swallowed. “May I — 
may I talk to the Glow for a 
moment? Alone?” 

“It is not possible,” said the 
translator. “The Glow does not 
speak English, you see, so that 
if you — ” 

“I mean alone except for you. 
Without the other humans.” 

Miss Garney warned: “Mr. 

Redfern, I certainly hope you 
aren’t trying to sell us out.” 
Redfern didn’t have to answer 
that, because the Glow rose ma- 
jestically on all of his legs and 
twittered in a commanding tone. 
The Fnit guards picked up Miss 
Garney and the men and bore 
them, chains clanking, outside. 

The translator said: “You may 
speak.” 

TT HAD BEEN a lie, of course; 

the ship’s heaters kept it well 
above the temperature of the am- 
bient air. But Redfern was shiv- 
ering by the time he got there 
and he turned them up a notch. 

The Fnit para-female chittered 
furiously at him. He said: “Don’t 
worry about a thing. The old man 
will be here in the morning.” 

He shucked the parka and 
gloves and stared moodily at the 
control board. Nothing could 




stop him from kicking the Fnit 
out the baselock, warming up the 
Golightly drive and lifting gently 
off the surface of Capella XII in 
a gentle cat’s-cradle of magnetic 
force lines. Less than three weeks 
and he’d be home . 

He sighed and contemplated 
without much confidence the gul- 
libility of the Fnits. If only Miss 
Garney, ethereal and adorable 
Miss Garney, were here with 
him! But the Glow had refused 
to let anyone else come along to 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




j'V; .. •’ 

flMl 



“rescue” the Fnit para-female; he 
wanted the others as hostages. 

Redfern stretched out on the 
padded navigator’s couch. He was 
so keyed up, he realized dismally, 
that it would be impossible for 
him to get to sleep; he would no 
doubt spend the whole long 
Capellan night worrying and 
brooding and . 

He woke up with the clatter 
of insectoid feet in the baselock 
scratching at his eardrums. A 
Fnit face peered curiously into 



the ship, disappeared, and was 
replaced by the whitely gleaming 
face of the Glow himself. The 
Glow sprang to the side of his 
para-bride, and there was a mad 
chittering and clattering of fond- 
ly caressing arthropod limbs as 
the lovers were reunited. 

Redfern breathed again. Be- 
hind the Glow were other Fnits, 
and with them were the general, 
the major, Mr. Cowper — and 
last, and emphatically complain- 
ing, Miss Garney. The Fnit Glow 



WITH REDFERN ON CAPELLA XII 



139 



had kept his word. Redfern be- 
gan to feel slightly happier as he 
stood up and rustily began to 
walk toward the newcomers. 

“ — know that I am absolutely 
no good in the morning without 
my tea,” Miss Garney was tell- 
ing everyone within earshot. “And 
still they drag me, utterly drag 
me, here, without even a decent 
word!” She caught sight of Red- 
fern and her tone from hot rage 
became ice. “Ah! Your little 
scheme didn’t work, eh? Couldn’t 
manipulate the Golightly con- 
trols, is that it? So you were not 
able to make your escape at our 
expense after all, were you?” 

T> EDFERN had incredulously 
-*-*• opened his mouth to answer 
and then remembered the Fnits. 
He turned to the translator. 
“Everything all right?” 

The translator said: “It so ap- 
pears. You are sure you do not 
wish to change your mind? There 
will be many grubs and this para- 
female is small . 

“Thanks, no. Let’s get on with 
it.” 

The translator said philosoph- 
ically: “Then let it be as you 
request. Come, the Glow will ac- 
company us to watch the spec- 
tacle of your burning.” 

“Burning?” cried Miss Garney. 
“But I thought — they’ve got 
the Fnit back — I mean — ” 
“Burning,” said the translator. 



“Let us go to the pyre.” 

Redfern led the way, well out 
of range of Miss Garney’s com- 
plaining voice. Beside him, the 
translator twittered unendingly, 
but Redfern was hardly listening. 
They came to the cleft in the 
hills where his own old rocket 
was nestled on its tail-pads and 
he scrambled aboard, the transla- 
tor following awkwardly. 

It was like being home again. 
He touched the walls and bat- 
tered control panel lovingly. He 
ran his fingers over the jet keys 
and patted the familiar naviga- 
tional books in the lock-shelf over 
the controls. There was the gray 
cover of Hypertrails, giving 
course settings for every star; the 
Rocket Engineer’s Handbook; the 
Digest of Interstellar Law; Hig- 
gins’ Astronauts’ Companion. 

He took down the gold-em- 
bossed volume of Higgins senti- 
mentally and let it fall open. 
There were the remembered pin- 
ups, just as he had last seen them 
— full-color stereoscopic views 
of the most delectable beauties of 
the Solar System. How wise 
of the Astrogational Board to 
make Higgins required equip- 
ment for solitary navigators! And 
yet how these great beauties 
palled into insignificance, Red- 
fern thought fondly, compared 
with the flesh-and-blood loveli- 
ness of — 

He swallowed and took a closer 



140 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



look at the pinups, just as the 
rest of the party came panting 
and arguing into the airlock. He 
glanced up at Miss Garney and 
unbelievingly again at the pinups. 

Something was wrong some- 
where, he thought in horror. It 
didn’t occur to Redfern that he 
had been fifteen months in space 
and that even the Wicked Witch 
of the North would have looked 
attractive to his woman-starved 
eyes. He had forgotten how much 
more attractive the soft, supple 
flesh of youth might be than the 
set, determined lines of Miss 
Garney’s face. 

All he knew was that here 
were the pinups, and here was 
Miss Garney, and somehow he 
had made a terrible mistake. 

r T»HE TRANSLATOR was chit- 
tering: “It is complete. You 
will now combust yourselves ac- 
cording to our pact.” 

Redfern ignored the yelps from 
the rest of the human party. “All 
right, let’s get at it.” 

“One moment,” chirped the 
Fnit. “The Glow has asked that 
I remind you of your undertak- 
ings. Firstly, you have stated that 
it would be inconvenient to you 
to die as we proposed — that is, 
with the grubs of the Glow’s fe- 
male in your flesh.” 

“Very inconvenient,” Redfern 
agreed. 

“And secondly, that you under- 



take to burn yourselves to death, 
complete with this structure in 
which we are presently talking.” 

“Right,” said Redfern. 

“It is strange to the Glow that 
this metal should burn. He does 
not doubt your word, but he 
must protect himself. You have 
promised to go up in flame for 
him, and if you do not do so, 
there will be steps taken.” 

“Oh, we’ll go up in flame, all 
right,” promised Redfern. 

“But,” insisted the translator, 
“if you do not, then, thirdly, the 
Glow reminds you that there are 
twenty-six other humans on the 
planet. If you should cheat our 
justice, it is they who will receive 
the grubs in your place. All of 
them. Now you may proceed.” 
And the Fnit clambered back- 
ward out of the lock. 

Redfern slammed the lock and 
dogged it. General Glick protest- 
ed : “See here, this ship won’t 
burn, sir! If you think we will be 
a party to — ” 

“Drop dead,” said Redfern 
moodily. “But strap yourselves in 
first.” He didn’t even look over 
his shoulder to see if they had 
done so. Let them get banged 
around a bit, he thought savagely, 
and put his fingers on the main- 
drive rocket controls. 

There was a cough and a roar 
and a rumbling scream, and 
every movable object in the 
cabin shook and slid about as 



WITH REDFERN ON CAPELLA XII 



141 



they drove up from the surface 
of Capella XII. 

Forty minutes later, they were 
orbiting around the planet and 
Redfern began coaxing his an- 
cient auxiliaries to ease them into 
hyperspace for the long trip 
home. 

The four others in the cramped 
cabin rubbed their bruises and 
screamed at him, singly and in 
chorus. Redfern gave them the 
silence of his back. 

G ENERAL Glick’s bass roar, 
rumbling under the voices of 
the others, was raging: “ — most 
disgraceful conduct I have ever 
observed in my life, sir! Didn’t 
you hear what the Fnit said? 
Our fellow human beings! Be- 
trayed! Left to perish most foully! 
What will they say at the Club? 
For make no mistake, sir, this 
will be found out. Massacred, 
every human being on Capella 
XII, to save your craven skin! 
And then we flee like cowardly 
babes in this rattletrap, when our 
own ship is thrice as big and 
faster and — ” 

“Don’t even talk to him, Sir 
Vivian,” Miss Garney advised 
coldly. “He isn’t worth it.” 

“Eh,” said the general after a 
pause. “I suppose you’re right. 
But just to think,” he went on 
morosely, from his hammock, 
“that my name, the name of Gen- 
eral Sir Vivian Mowgli-Glick, 

M2 



should be linked with a pusillani- 
mous, chicken-hearted, black 
deed like that!” 

Mr. Cowper said: “Newborns, 
General. What can you expect?” 
“I suppose that’s it,” the gen- 
eral agreed moodily. “Takes 
time to develop a real code, 
what? Let him live a half dozen 
lives or so, like you and me and 
Miss — ” 

“General!” cried the girl. 

“Oh, sorry,” mumbled the gen- 
eral. They went on like that and 
Redfern, doggedly busy with his 
auxiliaries, smiled coldly to him- 
self. So she was as ancient as the 
general, was she? Thank heaven, 
he told himself virtuously, that 
he had known from the first she 
wasn’t worth pursuing. The im- 
pudent nerve of these zombies! 
Taking up space that later gen- 
erations deserved to have — and 
blaspheming him for saving the 
lives they had no right to! 

There was a clunk and the 
wavering lines of force came into 
phase. The stars winked out in 
the viewplate and they were in 
featureless hyperspace. 

Redfern sighed, and set course, 
and turned to face his guests. 

“We’re on our way,” he told 
them. “Now do you want to listen 
to what I have to say?” 

“No!” said the general, the 
major and Mr. Cowper. What 
Miss Garney said was: “Beast!” 
“Suit yourself,” Redfern told 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



them. “But you’re on my ship 
and I’ll thank you to mind your 
manners.” 

“On your ship, are we?” 
shrieked Miss Garney. “And 
whose fault is that, I’d like to 
know? Why couldn’t we have 
taken our own ship — I mean 
assuming we were going to leave 
the other Earthmen to that horri- 
ble death?” 

Redfern said, with the last bit 
of his patience: “We couldn’t take 
your ship because I didn’t want 
to leave the others to a horrible 
death.” 

A T LEAST he had their inter- 
est. They glared at him and 
Major Di Candia said: “Do you 
suppose the fellow means any- 
thing by that?” 

“Of course not!” said Miss 
Garney. “It’s only a cheap lie to 
make us forgive him — not that 
we ever will.” 

“Ah, why do I waste my time 
talking to you?” Redfern asked 
disgustedly. “Look, what kind of 
drive did your ship have?” 

“Full Golightly,” Miss Garney 
said proudly. “Magnetic warp 
throughout, even for planetside 
landings. It cost nearly — ” 

“Never mind what it cost.” 
Redfern rapped the hull of his 
own ship. “This one’s a rocket. 
Now do you see the difference?” 
“Certainly I see the difference,” 
snapped Miss Garney. “It will 



take us twice as long to get home 
— to say nothing of the fact that 
the five of us will be huddled in 
this little rathole of a cabin the 
whole way!” 

“No,” said Redfern. “The dif- 
ference is that yours was not a 
rocket. I arranged with the Glow 
for us to incinerate ourselves, as 
you perhaps heard the Fnit trans- 
lator say. It was the only thing 
we could do; would you have 
preferred to take the place of 
the Fnit para-female you so clev- 
erly kidnaped — ” They didn’t 
even have the grace to blush, he 
saw unbelievingly — “and have 
baby Fnits hatching in your 
bodies? Maybe you would, but 
I wouldn’t.” 

“But the Earthmen, sir!” snap- 
ped Sir Vivian. “You’ve betrayed 
them!” 

Redfern sighed. “I promised 
the Glow he could watch us go 
up in flame. And what did he 
see?” 

“Why — he saw us escaping.” 

“No!” said Redfern. “He saw 
the wash of flame from our 
rockets. He’s just a Fnit, remem- 
ber, and they’ve never seen a 
rocket land — mine is the only 
one on the whole planet and I 
landed at night, when the Fnits 
are tucked away. So he saw us 
go up in flame — literally! We’re 
burned up — as far as they know. 
The Glow is satisfied. The hu- 
mans are safe. We’re on our way 



WITH REDFERN ON CAPELLA XII 



143 



home. And now — ” he added — 
“if you will kindly form a single 
line and pucker up, ladies first, 
I shall extend my left foot.” 
They might not be bright, he 
thought to himself admiringly, 
but they certainly were good and 
stubborn. It was nearly an hour 
before they all got it straight that 
the remaining Earthmen on 
Capella XII would not be massa- 
cred, and they themselves were 
safe enough, and somebody could 
even go back and pick up their 
ship, sooner or later, so that all 
they had lost was their time. And 
then each one of them manfully 
apologized. 

OOD show, really,” burbled 
the general, the last to get 
the thing straight in his mind. He 
dragged his hammock closer to 
Redfern’s. “Brilliant,” he went on, 
tying the rope-end into position 
for a nice, comfortable chat. 
“Made it look like a blasted sut- 
tee, what? I’ve not seen the like 
of it since the old days in India. 
Reminds me of a time in Hydera- 
bad — ’86, it must have been.” 
“Excuse me,” Redfern inter- 
rupted. “Got to check the auxili- 
aries.” It looked as if it was going 
to be a long voyage, he thought 
drearily, staring at the perfectly 
automatic controls of the auxili- 
aries and wishing his father had 
got enough money from the bank 
for a larger ship. 

144 



“Mr. Redfern?” 

He turned with a start. The 
voice was meltingly sweet; Miss 
Garney was smiling dewily. 

“Dear boy,” she said, “I — I 
just wanted to say that you were 
perfectly splendid. I do hope 
you’ll forgive us for the terrible 
way we acted. And,” she added 
archly, “I certainly hope you 
won’t pay too much attention to 
— well, what Sir Vivian said. 
You know, about — uh — age.” 

“Of course not,” Redfern said 
glassily, watching her as a bird 
might watch a python. 

She reached daintily across 
him to pick up the volume of 
Higgins. She glanced at it, tit- 
tered, and looked coyly at Red- 
fern. 

“Naughty,” she reproved and, 
before he could stop her, dropped 
the book of pinups into the dis- 
posal chute. “You won’t need 
these, dear boy. We’ll be together 
for a good long time, won’t we? 
And, really, don’t you think that 
it never hurts if a woman is just 
the teentsiest bit older? Especial- 
ly for a man as experienced as 
you?” 

Fifty-six days, he calculated, 
staring at the chugging auxili- 
aries. Fifty-six days with the gen- 
eral, the major, Mr. Cowper . 
and Miss Garney. 

It was going to be . a very long 
voyage.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Looking For Us, Professor? 

"Hmm, yes. I was just cogitating upon the causes of GALAXY 
Science Fiction's phenomenal growth in popularity." 

"And that needs an explanation, Professor?" 

"From a socio-psychological viewpoint, most definitely. To 
what do you attribute the constant increase of interest?" 

"Well . let's try it this way. Professor. Suppose we ask the 
questions and you answer them." 

"So? A bit unusual, but go right ahead." 

"Do you think atomic doom is the only future for mankind?" 

"Not exactly, but the newspapers and the commentators—" 

"Of course. Well, we SHOW other possible futures. Do you 
believe we will be able to leave the Earth?" 

"Eventually, perhaps. But not in our lifetime." 

"We don't agree. Assuming you're right, though, isn't that all 
the more reason to want to know what we'll find on other 
planets, Professor?" 

"I think I see what you mean." 

"Can we achieve immortality?" 

"Ah. Hum. I've often wondered." 

"And travel to different eras in time?" 

"That would be exciting." 

"And you've been trying to discover why GALAXY is growing 
so popular? Every idea we've mentioned— and a lot more, be- 
sides— is treated dramatically and vividly in GALAXY! You really 
live them!" 

"Umm. How do I subscribe? After all, one shouldn't resist a 
trend, should one? Heh, heh!" 

"Just fill out the coupon— or make out your own order and 
send it in. The coupon's for your convenience, not ours. And now 
you'll be one of us!"
